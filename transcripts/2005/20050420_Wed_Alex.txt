[00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:06.139]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:07.860]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.681]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:11.162]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:12.763]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:17.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.728]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:37.328]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:43.953]  It is Wednesday, the 20th day of April, 2005.
[00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:46.475]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:53.820]  We've got Wolfgang Grochi joining us in the middle of the next hour.
[00:00:53.881 --> 00:01:04.589]  He's a futurist, former IBM executive, who's going around telling everyone that soon we'll all have microchips and how wonderful it's going to be.
[00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:14.931]  And being a former top exec and futurist for IBM, I'd say he's certainly got the background to call himself an expert on this subject.
[00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:15.652]  He'll be joining us.
[00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:28.002]  Also, just for five or ten minutes, I'm going to have on some of the winners of the ArnoldExposed.com TV ad contest.
[00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:31.845]  And I do have those winners here.
[00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:42.789]  And we will be going over that a little bit and posting those on the website arnoldexposed.com here in the next few hours.
[00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.550]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.314]  Also, and I mean it when I say it, I'm getting better and better about this, I want to take a lot of your calls early in this first hour.
[00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:55.256]  We'll go to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:55.356 --> 00:02:02.701]  Any news item, any story, any topic you want to discuss, any questions you have for myself, any statements you want to make,
[00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.571]  We're going to open the phones up coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:06.651]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:06.811]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:13.355]  And the websites, of course, are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and don't forget Infowars.net as well.
[00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:19.178]  New Pope's brother is very concerned about his election.
[00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:48.474]  His 81-year-old brother, the brother of Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, he is very concerned about what he calls his bad health, and his age.
[00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.014]  We'll be talking about that later.
[00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:55.495]  Israel praises Pope despite past Nazi ties.
[00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:58.216]  That's the Associated Press headline.
[00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:11.069]  Israeli politicians and rabbis on Wednesday praised the new pope for his strong condemnations of anti-Semitism despite the pontiff's ties to the Nazi party as a youth.
[00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.731]  I mean, does any of this even matter?
[00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:25.835]  I talked to some Catholics yesterday that I trust and that I know are anti-New World Order and they told me that
[00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:42.040]  Mr. Ratzinger, even though the media is calling him conservative, is extremely globalist and that he is a mason.
[00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:45.342]  And it fits.
[00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:56.670]  They elected him on the 19th, and that's the big high holy Masonic day for starting something new, for laying foundations.
[00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.930]  But
[00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:04.482]  The question is, how long will Pope Ratzinger, Pope Benedict, even be around?
[00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:08.463]  But I'm not a Catholic.
[00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:11.744]  Catholics, or anybody else for that matter, are welcome to weigh in on this.
[00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:16.565]  I heard people saying he's a great conservative and how dare people attack him.
[00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:18.645]  That's how the globalists do it.
[00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:26.467]  They call somebody conservative that isn't conservative, and then people tend to draw their battle lines accordingly.
[00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:30.185]  But I've been saying there's a billion Catholics.
[00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:33.446]  The news is reporting a billion, 100 million.
[00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.909]  Oregon bill requires driver's license applicants to register for draft.
[00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.010]  Very interesting.
[00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.971]  Also, AP sues U.S.
[00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:43.992]  government to get Guantanamo Bay documents.
[00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:47.914]  Truckers are angry at new anti-terror rules.
[00:04:48.414 --> 00:04:49.515]  We'll all be under this soon.
[00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:53.557]  Police beat woman having a diabetic reaction.
[00:04:54.778 --> 00:04:56.899]  But some good news, too, on police getting in trouble.
[00:04:57.623 --> 00:04:58.303]  Using tasers?
[00:04:58.323 --> 00:04:58.783]  We'll be back.
[00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:02.524]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.704 --> 00:05:05.785]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:09.826]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:14.107]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:18.228]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:20.169]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:28.396]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:31.639]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:34.661]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:41.287]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:42.308]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.722]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:07.867]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:13.252]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:16.075]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove...
[00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:16.575]  We're good.
[00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:43.830]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:50.316]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:51.297]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:52.298]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:01.784]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:03.985]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:07:04.185 --> 00:07:04.885]  Prepare yourself.
[00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:08.767]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:14.630]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.071]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:07:16.231 --> 00:07:18.872]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:20.553]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:07:20.813 --> 00:07:23.654]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:24.455]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:30.463]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:08.252]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:11.894]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:25.602]  All right, coming up in the middle of the next hour, we've got a former IBM executive and top futurist who's out basically promoting how we're all going to have microchips very soon.
[00:08:27.203 --> 00:08:30.965]  Joining us in the middle of the next hour, at the start of the next hour, we're going to have on...
[00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:41.668]  The two fellows who won the video part of the contest for ArnoldExposed.com, have them on for a few minutes.
[00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:46.289]  They did an amazing job, and you can see the winning video ad at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:51.810]  We'll also be posting it at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.271]  By this afternoon or later this evening, we should have the audio winner up there.
[00:08:57.291 --> 00:09:00.332]  I'm also going to post some of the other great entries on the website,
[00:09:01.593 --> 00:09:02.333]  On the websites.
[00:09:03.034 --> 00:09:04.995]  And all of you that entered the contest won.
[00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:13.960]  You got in the arena, you got out of the spectator seats, out of the bucket seats, and you did something historical, and I want to commend all of you.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.622]  But we'll talk more about that coming up the next hour.
[00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:21.283]  We're going to be going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:09:21.303 --> 00:09:21.363]  1-800-259-9231
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.485]  And I want to go quickly to your calls, so have your question, your comment ready, or the particular news item you want to discuss.
[00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:32.927]  We can get on to the next person.
[00:09:33.347 --> 00:09:39.613]  I love taking calls because the listeners take us in so many different interesting and important directions that I wouldn't have gone in.
[00:09:41.274 --> 00:09:44.257]  Police beat woman having diabetic reaction.
[00:09:45.378 --> 00:09:49.121]  And people that have these diabetic reactions literally start passing out.
[00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:51.043]  They start hallucinating.
[00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:59.235]  And she was driving around, running into things, and the police ran up to her.
[00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:00.555]  She didn't have any criminal record.
[00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:10.500]  And frankly, I don't blame them for when she didn't stop, but she had her window down and started driving off again, but they tasered her.
[00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:18.484]  The problem is they beat her up, and she has two big black eyes, and that's the problem.
[00:10:19.545 --> 00:10:26.548]  Is that when you don't submit to them and they go ahead and still get you in custody, so many times they go ahead and beat the living daylights out of you.
[00:10:26.568 --> 00:10:28.029]  It's like people who've been choking.
[00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:30.210]  It's been on the news.
[00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.570]  We've had them on this broadcast.
[00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:42.195]  When somebody starts choking, and I've saved somebody who's choking before, they start stumbling around and falling into things and resisting you, and you're not supposed to taser them 12 times.
[00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:45.785]  So we need to have some discretion.
[00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:50.427]  And plus, once somebody's down, there's no reason to continue tasering them.
[00:10:50.807 --> 00:10:56.510]  It's this mad dog, killer, gladiatorial instinct we see that so many police have had.
[00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.392]  Basically, they've selected them for this now, and it's causing a problem.
[00:11:02.332 --> 00:11:05.494]  But there is some good news on this front.
[00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:08.515]  Top Charge, I think this is the first time ever,
[00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:10.705]  That's what NBC is saying.
[00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:15.169]  Cop charged for using taser gun on suspect.
[00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:23.757]  And this was the case a month ago that the police at first were trying to defend, but it was patent torture.
[00:11:24.838 --> 00:11:32.285]  He was refusing to give a urine sample, and so the cop had been watching the TV shows where they torture people every episode, and that's...
[00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:35.926]  They support that on the TV shows and say this is good.
[00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:41.587]  To get answers, you've got to break arms and taser and even torture small children in front of their parents.
[00:11:42.107 --> 00:11:43.707]  That's the normal plot now.
[00:11:44.547 --> 00:11:45.288]  And even U.S.
[00:11:45.328 --> 00:11:54.970]  News and World Report's got an article out, cover story this week, admitting that people watch TV and believe it's real concerning law enforcement.
[00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.370]  So finally it's being pointed out.
[00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.571]  But cop charged for using taser gun on suspect in hospital bed.
[00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:09.081]  Orlando, Florida, for the first time, an Orlando police officer is facing criminal charges for misusing a taser gun.
[00:12:10.422 --> 00:12:11.483]  First they fired him.
[00:12:12.204 --> 00:12:15.366]  First they tried defending, then people didn't go along with it.
[00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:17.908]  Then they fired him, now they've charged him, which is good.
[00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:20.810]  Because this person is a complete nutcase.
[00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:27.695]  An affidavit reveals the officer used the weapon to obtain a urine sample from a handcuffed suspect, WESH
[00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.319]  Two NBC News reported.
[00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:48.763]  The information filed Monday charges officer Peter Linenkamp with misdemeanor battery and the prosecutor said some of the best evidence against the officer comes from his own report on the incident.
[00:12:49.604 --> 00:12:50.564]  And that's what hung him.
[00:12:51.824 --> 00:12:56.966]  Because first the police spokesman tried to say, well, the man was resisting.
[00:12:57.046 --> 00:12:58.146]  And then people said, well, wait a minute.
[00:12:58.767 --> 00:12:59.487]  The cop's own
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.401]  Because, see, he thought this was normal.
[00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:04.922]  He thought that it was okay to do this.
[00:13:05.482 --> 00:13:18.408]  In his own report, he said, well, the man refused to give a urine sample, and so they had him restrained in a restraining seat, which he didn't resist being strapped down.
[00:13:19.008 --> 00:13:25.671]  His ankles, his knees, his thighs, his stomach, his upper torso, his arms, his neck, completely restrained.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.483]  And they stuck a catheter in him and nothing came out.
[00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:34.986]  Of course, nurses know that someone cannot resist a catheter.
[00:13:35.006 --> 00:13:42.071]  It goes up into the urethra, up close to the bladder, and there's nothing you can do.
[00:13:43.071 --> 00:13:48.455]  If there is any of the waste there, any of the urine there, it will flow.
[00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:51.778]  Well, the cop is now a doctor, basically.
[00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:56.541]  It's like school teachers think their doctor is ordering Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:13:57.663 --> 00:14:02.386]  And so he tasered him once, and the man began to beg and said, I can't.
[00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:05.788]  Well, sorry, buddy.
[00:14:05.848 --> 00:14:08.990]  And so the cop waited a while and tasered him again.
[00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:15.954]  And then I guess figured out that the man really didn't have any urine.
[00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.516]  And then the report said that a few drops did go in.
[00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:20.517]  And so they said, well, that's okay.
[00:14:20.537 --> 00:14:23.179]  Of course, the man had already admitted that he was on cocaine.
[00:14:25.337 --> 00:14:28.619]  He had already admitted that he had used cocaine, so there was no reason to even do that.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:37.084]  But imagine, you're chained down with a catheter in you, and the cop doesn't like it that you're not supplying him, and so he starts tasering you.
[00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:41.186]  There's no other name for it but torture.
[00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:47.990]  So the story here isn't even that he tortured him or that he tasered him because he wanted a urine sample.
[00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.793]  The story is that the cop, the police officer, thought that this was normal.
[00:14:55.481 --> 00:15:01.002]  Thought that you taser people that are scrapped down if they don't give you the evidence.
[00:15:01.062 --> 00:15:12.645]  Of course, we have a Fifth Amendment where we don't have to verbally answer questions, but they have a new thing where if you don't verbally answer questions, they will put pepper spray in your eyes, they will taser you.
[00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:16.846]  I've seen other cases, and these are actually being upheld by the departments.
[00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:23.247]  They're being challenged in court now, and we haven't seen the outcome of that judicial challenge, but
[00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.609]  They do this.
[00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.451]  Right here in Austin, there was the famous case.
[00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:41.235]  Well, it was the Austin case, but it happened in the state where one of the fugitives was hiding out, where they put the gun to his head to answer questions, and then they put it on the news like it was normal.
[00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:43.956]  Well, we just put guns to people's heads.
[00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.457]  I mean, he may be a murderer.
[00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:53.240]  And then, of course, they did a DNA test later, and it wasn't the person that did it, but that doesn't stop them from...
[00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:56.204]  It's like with Eric Rudolph.
[00:15:56.264 --> 00:15:57.404]  First it was Welch.
[00:15:58.605 --> 00:15:59.586]  I mean, Richard Jewell.
[00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.227]  Then it was somebody else named Welch.
[00:16:01.347 --> 00:16:03.648]  I mean, they just go on and on.
[00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:06.630]  With the anthrax, they claimed it was a scientist named Hatfield.
[00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.131]  Then it was somebody else.
[00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:08.991]  Now they don't know.
[00:16:09.492 --> 00:16:09.952]  Don't worry.
[00:16:09.972 --> 00:16:12.894]  They'll find the right patsy and torture them in the end.
[00:16:13.554 --> 00:16:14.675]  They always do.
[00:16:17.461 --> 00:16:21.362]  Based on what we have as evidence, this was not a safety issue.
[00:16:21.723 --> 00:16:26.985]  This was a compliance issue to provide urine, so that raises the level of a criminal act.
[00:16:27.565 --> 00:16:30.006]  In this case, it is misdemeanor battery.
[00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:33.547]  Well, it's torture, said State Attorney Spokesman Randy Means.
[00:16:34.547 --> 00:16:42.530]  In this report on the March 5th incidents, Lincoln Comp admitted to shocking Wheeler with a taser gun twice.
[00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.411]  Only minimum force necessary was used.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.725]  This attempt was deemed necessary by the medical staff, Lincoln Comp wrote in the report.
[00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:54.087]  There are times when people have medical problems.
[00:16:54.628 --> 00:17:00.953]  We have to make sure people get the treatment they need, said Lieutenant Brian Gilman of the Orlando Police Department.
[00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:02.894]  That's what they tried to say at first.
[00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:05.196]  Your medical treatment is being strapped down and shot.
[00:17:05.777 --> 00:17:07.318]  He'd already admitted that he was on cocaine.
[00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.503]  This is so weird how they spend this.
[00:17:11.983 --> 00:17:17.245]  So they're still charging him, but at the same time we're in the article making excuses for it.
[00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:19.386]  Pretty weird.
[00:17:19.426 --> 00:17:20.647]  Another article out of Florida.
[00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:25.009]  Miami-Dade agrees to pay $4.5 million for invasive searches of prisoners.
[00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:32.532]  They admit at the free trade protest that police did a lot of really bad stuff, and we'll go over that later.
[00:17:33.912 --> 00:17:36.033]  But first off, Randy in Texas.
[00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:36.714]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:36.754 --> 00:17:37.494]  Go ahead, Randy.
[00:17:38.246 --> 00:17:39.146]  Hey, can you hear me?
[00:17:39.347 --> 00:17:40.207]  Yes, I can, sir.
[00:17:40.847 --> 00:17:44.369]  Yes, I ordered and I watched your video, Martial Law.
[00:17:45.569 --> 00:17:59.376]  Now, I don't know if it's just me, but I found the most revealing aspect of your video was John Buchanan's part when he gave the background on the Bushes, Prescott and George Herbert Walker.
[00:17:59.716 --> 00:18:01.557]  That's a powerful nine minutes.
[00:18:02.197 --> 00:18:04.458]  Yes, it is, and it was revealing.
[00:18:04.638 --> 00:18:05.739]  And I'm calling you
[00:18:06.226 --> 00:18:07.587]  Well, I have a question, a comment.
[00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:12.350]  First, I want to ask you, how can I get more information on the things that he's speaking about?
[00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.531]  This is why I'm asking.
[00:18:13.631 --> 00:18:14.652]  I don't know if it's just me.
[00:18:14.712 --> 00:18:15.793]  Well, do you have a computer?
[00:18:15.813 --> 00:18:17.174]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:18:17.214 --> 00:18:18.034]  I do have a computer.
[00:18:18.054 --> 00:18:24.118]  I tried to do a search on Buchanan, and my computer locked up, and it hasn't been saying the same.
[00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:25.820]  I mean, I'm dead serious.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.080]  I did John Buchanan.
[00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:29.522]  I found some ifs on them.
[00:18:29.562 --> 00:18:34.205]  Well, that was probably... I mean, I did searches all the time on those names.
[00:18:34.225 --> 00:18:34.866]  It was probably...
[00:18:35.515 --> 00:18:38.656]  Just, you know, coincidence that that happened.
[00:18:39.156 --> 00:18:43.416]  Hopefully it was, but my computer hasn't been the same ever since I did a search on his name.
[00:18:43.476 --> 00:18:46.597]  I just thought that was ironic, but I wanted to give more info.
[00:18:47.297 --> 00:18:50.578]  Well, yeah, well then you can get your computer fixed.
[00:18:51.998 --> 00:19:02.340]  And then once your computer is fixed, you notice that interview was done, I think like September 2nd, and he says in the interview the London Guardian is going to be doing a report.
[00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:12.070]  And then we show the Leningardian Report from like 25 days later, just as he said it they would report, showing the headline, you know, Bush's grandfather helped the Nazis.
[00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.330]  Right.
[00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:13.811]  And he goes over it.
[00:19:14.271 --> 00:19:18.012]  There's also reports out of the New Hampshire Gazette.
[00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.554]  There have been a bunch of other mainstream news articles.
[00:19:21.614 --> 00:19:22.614]  The documents are there.
[00:19:22.654 --> 00:19:23.254]  They're real.
[00:19:23.774 --> 00:19:29.716]  But then we also show the news articles out of major New York papers from 1942.
[00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.419]  Showing the name Prescott Bush.
[00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:43.903]  So, in the film, we show all the news articles, but you can just write down the headlines, type those into a search engine, and you'll find the actual articles.
[00:19:45.483 --> 00:19:46.744]  Does that answer your question, Randy?
[00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:48.024]  Yeah, great.
[00:19:48.124 --> 00:19:55.747]  And you might want to rehash that to the list, in case they haven't watched it, what he said during those nine minutes, because I think that was just powerful.
[00:19:56.068 --> 00:19:57.248]  Well, thank you for the compliment.
[00:19:57.288 --> 00:19:58.028]  It is powerful.
[00:19:58.408 --> 00:19:59.669]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[00:20:01.247 --> 00:20:08.891]  If you're $10,000 in credit card debt or more and are making minimum monthly payments but getting nowhere, Debt Relief USA has the answer.

[00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:07.762]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:10.423]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[00:23:00.655 --> 00:23:06.163]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:23:06.363 --> 00:23:13.953]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Panex 2000 to the public.
[00:23:14.053 --> 00:23:18.379]  The Panex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle.

[00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:16.432]  The Last Caller brought up this little nine-minute segment from the new film, Martial Law.
[00:24:17.653 --> 00:24:20.074]  And it's three hours long on DVD.
[00:24:20.954 --> 00:24:23.595]  It's two and a half plus hours on VHS.
[00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:27.557]  And, of course, both versions have the John B. Cannon interview.
[00:24:28.117 --> 00:24:30.818]  And we just show all the mainstream news articles, all the documents.
[00:24:31.525 --> 00:24:33.046]  The Library of Congress documents.
[00:24:33.706 --> 00:24:37.388]  But forget all the new articles in major publications.
[00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:41.251]  We have the articles from the 1940s and 50s.
[00:24:41.411 --> 00:24:44.853]  I mean, we have the big establishment newspapers with the headlines.
[00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:47.674]  And we zoom right in on the Bushes' names.
[00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:50.116]  On Prescott, Bush, and others.
[00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:56.980]  And they were running the Nazi money up until the early 50s out of Germany.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.761]  In the middle of Texas...
[00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.811]  Into Argentina.
[00:25:00.831 --> 00:25:01.691]  They were bag men.
[00:25:02.452 --> 00:25:09.496]  They were on the board of directors for Fritz Thyssen, who actually was the main funder of Adolf Hitler.
[00:25:10.716 --> 00:25:13.958]  And, of course, people forget about all this.
[00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:14.879]  U.S.
[00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:16.960]  ambassador to England.
[00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:18.561]  Mobster.
[00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:20.502]  Joseph Kennedy was pro-Hitler.
[00:25:21.863 --> 00:25:23.644]  And people forget about all of this.
[00:25:23.744 --> 00:25:26.165]  But he was nothing compared to the Bushes.
[00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:31.028]  And they are continuing those policies today.
[00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:33.729]  Let's talk to T.J.
[00:25:33.849 --> 00:25:34.530]  in Minnesota.
[00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.390]  T.J., go ahead.
[00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:36.511]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:37.351]  How are you today?
[00:25:37.572 --> 00:25:38.772]  Good, sir.
[00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:44.636]  You hit the word IBM, which is a hot button here at my OP here.
[00:25:45.396 --> 00:25:46.997]  I want to give you some background.
[00:25:47.117 --> 00:25:50.659]  You're going to have an interview with an IBM official, apparently.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.783]  I want to give you a firsthand background geographically in real time.
[00:25:57.373 --> 00:25:59.754]  IBM is referred to the Blue Goose.
[00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:04.397]  Their headquarters is in Rochester, Minnesota, not New York.
[00:26:05.538 --> 00:26:18.625]  It's 5.6 miles our distance from the Mayo Medical Foundation, which was stolen away from the Sisters of St.
[00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:23.808]  Francis a few years ago by the Cheney Bush conglomerate.
[00:26:24.689 --> 00:26:26.290]  You might want to ask this guy
[00:26:27.048 --> 00:26:48.925]  What the term Blue Goose means geographically to IBM employees, and is there any connection between Bomber Sites and IBM history, Hitler and IBM history, and why Dick Cheney left his post with the Mayo Medical Foundation when he became president?
[00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:56.135]  I mean, IBM's a giant sprawling complex.
[00:26:56.675 --> 00:27:00.718]  But it's sourced out of the same spot within five miles.
[00:27:01.218 --> 00:27:02.179]  No, I understand that, sir.
[00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:05.621]  What I'm saying is he's a futurist, a technologist.
[00:27:06.461 --> 00:27:07.882]  You'll know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:08.723 --> 00:27:14.066]  In that community where his cohorts get their
[00:27:14.864 --> 00:27:18.107]  Professional bearings and indoctrination.
[00:27:18.607 --> 00:27:21.670]  Those people are called beamers, and they have their own life.
[00:27:22.511 --> 00:27:28.236]  And it's government-controlled, and it's technology-controlled.
[00:27:28.276 --> 00:27:29.037]  No, I know it is.
[00:27:29.057 --> 00:27:30.778]  Thank you for the call.
[00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:33.901]  I've studied IBM extensively.
[00:27:33.981 --> 00:27:38.425]  It's the most elite corporation of the Fortune 500.
[00:27:38.905 --> 00:27:40.086]  Now they call it the Fortune 2000.
[00:27:42.632 --> 00:27:43.432]  And you name it.
[00:27:43.552 --> 00:27:45.753]  If it's evil, they're behind it, they're involved in it.
[00:27:46.754 --> 00:27:53.336]  We're just having a futurist on who's also been an IBM executive, and he's scheduled to come on.
[00:27:53.816 --> 00:27:55.577]  If he comes on, we'll have him on.
[00:27:56.997 --> 00:28:00.878]  But I know about the IBM and the Nazis.
[00:28:00.898 --> 00:28:01.919]  That's in my new film, too.
[00:28:03.319 --> 00:28:05.200]  And just type in IBM and the Nazis.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.321]  I mean, those machines, the international business machines...
[00:28:10.182 --> 00:28:18.985]  The accompanying number to access those primitive computers was the little tattoo that people in the camps got.
[00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.926]  That was the International Business Machine number.
[00:28:23.486 --> 00:28:26.627]  Mr. Watson was a big supporter of the Fuhrer.
[00:28:26.687 --> 00:28:30.508]  We have photos of him with the Fuhrer up right until 1940.
[00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:35.249]  Of course, they're one of the founding families of Bohemian Grove.
[00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.472]  And IBM owns thousands of front companies.
[00:28:40.532 --> 00:28:41.233]  I mean, thousands.
[00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:44.075]  The Human Genome, they took that over from the government.
[00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:46.316]  They're involved.
[00:28:46.376 --> 00:28:48.317]  They own most of the debt for Applied Digital.
[00:28:49.678 --> 00:28:52.140]  Impliable Microchip Company, that's another one of their fronts.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.841]  And, I mean, you name it, they're in on it.
[00:28:54.861 --> 00:28:57.343]  The National ID cards, the tracker chips, all of it.
[00:28:59.284 --> 00:29:05.288]  Yeah, it's definitely a... It's as high as it gets.
[00:29:05.308 --> 00:29:05.688]  It's very...
[00:29:07.163 --> 00:29:09.445]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ann in New Mexico.
[00:29:09.465 --> 00:29:11.646]  Ann, we're going to hold you over, but go ahead.
[00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:12.687]  What's your first comments?
[00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:14.068]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:29:14.108 --> 00:29:14.488]  Hi.
[00:29:14.788 --> 00:29:15.789]  Yahweh bless you.
[00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:16.429]  Thank you.
[00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:23.834]  I've been busy with my little puppies, so I've been listening or calling in lately, but could I recommend something for Randy?
[00:29:23.854 --> 00:29:28.777]  Randy in Texas wants to know about pushing the Nazis?
[00:29:28.857 --> 00:29:29.898]  Yeah, when we come back?
[00:29:30.138 --> 00:29:31.519]  Yeah, recommend it on the other side.
[00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:32.460]  Okay, thank you.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.040]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:37.576]  And if I sound bummed out today, I'm usually very upbeat.
[00:29:38.396 --> 00:29:45.078]  Every once in a while, I get pretty bummed out.
[00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:48.999]  But I'm not in a very good mood, I'll tell you right now.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.360]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.461]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.381 --> 00:29:58.082]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.278 --> 00:30:04.982]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:09.567]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:16.734]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:30:17.114 --> 00:30:23.759]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.542]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:27.562 --> 00:30:28.503]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWalk.com.
[00:30:32.646 --> 00:30:39.812]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:46.578]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:51.462]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:51.643 --> 00:30:54.185]  That's D-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:30:54.345 --> 00:30:58.989]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:31:00.914 --> 00:31:02.875]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:02.955 --> 00:31:13.681]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:18.584]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:29.970]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:37.420]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.821 --> 00:31:39.964]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.445 --> 00:31:45.412]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:31:45.712 --> 00:31:52.015]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:56.277]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:57.257]  That's toll free.
[00:31:57.277 --> 00:31:57.317]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.292 --> 00:32:02.432]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:32:02.732 --> 00:32:05.293]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:32:05.753 --> 00:32:13.336]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:32:13.696 --> 00:32:17.397]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[00:32:17.837 --> 00:32:18.377]  We're good to go.
[00:32:43.954 --> 00:32:47.036]  Free shipping and secure transaction as standard with every order.

[00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:53.061]  That is DiscountWatchStore.com slash radio.
[00:32:53.381 --> 00:32:54.141]  Or call toll free 866-371-2330.
[00:32:54.161 --> 00:32:54.882]  That's 866-371-2330.
[00:32:54.942 --> 00:33:06.951]  All right, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, with wide open telephones, a ton of news coming up and several big guests.
[00:33:13.806 --> 00:33:40.076]  And I just got reminded today that I had wanted to get Jimmy Vaughn on, the Grammy Award winning blues musician, on the broadcast, because tomorrow night, Jimmy and his band and many others are going to be having a benefit for the Austin Toll Party up in North Austin, and the details of all that are at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:42.265 --> 00:33:43.726]  Tunes, not tolls.
[00:33:44.246 --> 00:33:52.711]  And I was just told by my producer that he's scheduled to be on with us tomorrow in the second hour for a few minutes.
[00:33:53.472 --> 00:34:03.658]  So I look forward to having Jimmy on just a few hours before he takes the stage here in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:03.698 --> 00:34:06.639]  And there's a lot of other great people that are going to be there as well.
[00:34:06.699 --> 00:34:09.541]  So I hope to see everybody there tomorrow night.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.821]  And listen, you know I don't like to whine.
[00:34:12.841 --> 00:34:14.221]  I never really whine on the show.
[00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:16.422]  I'm going to be honest with listeners.
[00:34:16.442 --> 00:34:18.783]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:34:20.104 --> 00:34:25.686]  When I'm in the thick of things, I have limitless energy.
[00:34:28.447 --> 00:34:31.128]  But the last few weeks I haven't been working as hard.
[00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:37.310]  I've only been working about 10 hours a day instead of 16, 18 hours a day.
[00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:37.390]  And
[00:34:40.198 --> 00:34:48.201]  They have names for it, but when you've been working really, really hard and then you don't work as hard, then it's tough.
[00:34:48.881 --> 00:34:49.921]  I don't know how to explain it.
[00:34:52.442 --> 00:35:03.146]  I mean, just endless interviews, endless information, endless analysis, endless... It's unending.
[00:35:05.287 --> 00:35:06.627]  It's literally unending.
[00:35:09.128 --> 00:35:09.248]  And
[00:35:10.603 --> 00:35:10.923]  I don't know.
[00:35:10.963 --> 00:35:13.724]  I need a vacation or something is what I think.
[00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:24.429]  Frankly, though, since I've been semi-burnt out the last few weeks, I've been listening to rebroadcasts of the radio shows, and they've been a little bit better.
[00:35:25.009 --> 00:35:31.852]  So maybe I'm wearing the edge off of my baby teeth here.
[00:35:33.472 --> 00:35:34.633]  Baby teeth come in sharp.
[00:35:35.353 --> 00:35:37.734]  Maybe I'm wearing the edges off, but...
[00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:40.565]  I don't know.
[00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:42.587]  I'm also frustrated.
[00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.668]  There's so much evil.
[00:35:44.648 --> 00:35:45.569]  So much happening.
[00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.633]  So many examples of government corruption in this control grid that's going up.
[00:35:52.434 --> 00:35:57.138]  And at the same time, there's so many good things that are happening.
[00:35:57.978 --> 00:35:59.279]  So many people are waking up.
[00:35:59.419 --> 00:36:00.280]  So much action.
[00:36:01.101 --> 00:36:02.041]  It's taking place.
[00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:04.422]  So I'm also very positive.
[00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:07.562]  I mean, the last few weeks I've been in a good mood most of the time.
[00:36:07.622 --> 00:36:14.303]  It's just normally I have limitless energy and I'm so happy and can't wait to jump into the next pile of work.
[00:36:16.024 --> 00:36:26.606]  And, you know, it's gotten to the point now where some national radio show wants me on or national French TV wants to interview me or national British TV or national U.S.
[00:36:26.646 --> 00:36:27.926]  television wants to interview me.
[00:36:29.168 --> 00:36:38.650]  Or somebody wants to give me a national TV show and I just go, I actually like doing this radio show because I'm a creature of habit and repetition.
[00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:45.492]  And so I like doing this radio show because I like talking to you and it's so personal and individual.
[00:36:46.392 --> 00:36:49.052]  But I've got to gauge this.
[00:36:49.072 --> 00:36:51.653]  I'm sharing this with the audience somehow.
[00:36:52.433 --> 00:36:55.154]  Gauge this to try to figure out how to handle it.
[00:36:55.834 --> 00:36:56.754]  Because when I start
[00:36:57.785 --> 00:37:07.231]  Literally cringing when I have a stack of interviews to do, which is victory, which is getting the word out, which is waking millions of people up and reaching out.
[00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:21.420]  When I start cringing, to kind of use the rock and roll analogy, or you can use music analogy, period, it's like I've been doing a 10-year on-the-road concert, just an endless tour.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.043]  Or if it was a war, I've been on the front lines for 10 years.
[00:37:27.867 --> 00:37:29.788]  Completely consumed and obsessed with it.
[00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.192]  And really the biggest frustration is the quality then can't be there.
[00:37:36.393 --> 00:37:36.954]  The quality.
[00:37:36.974 --> 00:37:37.974]  I mean, I want to write a book.
[00:37:38.595 --> 00:37:39.275]  A real book.
[00:37:39.435 --> 00:37:41.757]  It's really well done with my real ideas.
[00:37:41.917 --> 00:37:46.420]  And to expose what the New World Order is really doing and to show how to bring them down.
[00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:49.963]  I want to make even better films.
[00:37:50.043 --> 00:37:51.604]  But it's just so much work.
[00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:54.106]  And I enjoy the work.
[00:37:55.749 --> 00:38:00.032]  I guess my mistake is I need to go back up to 17 hours a day, 18 hours a day.
[00:38:00.453 --> 00:38:02.534]  But then at the same time, I like to spend time with my family.
[00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:06.958]  And the more time I spend with my family, the more time I want to spend with them.
[00:38:06.978 --> 00:38:08.799]  And I have to literally tear myself away.
[00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:11.701]  I don't know.
[00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:24.191]  I just want to, especially during this great weather we've been having, 75 degrees every day, I want to just go with a picnic and lay out in a meadow in the woods.
[00:38:25.572 --> 00:38:29.675]  And just sit in a babbling brook.
[00:38:31.556 --> 00:38:33.177]  I want to go deep sea fishing.
[00:38:34.097 --> 00:38:35.978]  I want to go see movies and plays.
[00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:41.242]  I want to go see my son's and daughter's great grandmother.
[00:38:41.262 --> 00:38:42.482]  I want to spend more time with her.
[00:38:44.284 --> 00:38:45.124]  Really, I'm bitter.
[00:38:45.604 --> 00:38:48.526]  I hate the New World Order.
[00:38:49.127 --> 00:38:51.328]  But I fight the New World Order because I love my family.
[00:38:52.245 --> 00:38:53.285]  So it's a catch-22.
[00:38:53.546 --> 00:38:55.646]  Life is a catch-22 to defend my family.
[00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:58.628]  I can't spend as much time with my family as I want to.
[00:38:58.648 --> 00:39:03.010]  And I don't even know why I'm sharing this with you.
[00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.571]  I'm tired of looking into the darkness.
[00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.932]  I'm tired of having to focus on what it's doing.
[00:39:09.952 --> 00:39:11.613]  Because I have so much life.
[00:39:12.393 --> 00:39:13.154]  So much love.
[00:39:14.374 --> 00:39:16.195]  So much that I want to do.
[00:39:16.675 --> 00:39:18.336]  So many things I want to do for myself.
[00:39:19.945 --> 00:39:22.367]  And that goes for my work as well.
[00:39:24.828 --> 00:39:25.089]  I don't know.
[00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:26.790]  I'm sure you've all experienced it in life.
[00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.932]  I mean, I'm the last person who should complain.
[00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:36.496]  My life has been almost too fulfilling, too dynamic, too action-packed.
[00:39:37.657 --> 00:39:40.458]  And sometimes I just want a chance to slow down a little bit.
[00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:43.560]  But at the same time, I don't want to slow down.
[00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.201]  There's so much work to be done.
[00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:46.042]  It's a conundrum.
[00:39:47.903 --> 00:39:49.104]  It's a real conundrum.
[00:39:49.837 --> 00:39:53.320]  Or an enigma, I think might be a better word.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.581]  I just don't know where I stand.
[00:39:55.601 --> 00:40:01.526]  Of course, I've been working so much, I haven't even eaten today.
[00:40:02.426 --> 00:40:03.467]  That's another problem.
[00:40:04.007 --> 00:40:04.668]  I should eat.
[00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.931]  It's little things like that.
[00:40:13.735 --> 00:40:15.556]  I just want to commend all of you out there.
[00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.418]  I want you to know that
[00:40:19.645 --> 00:40:28.390]  That you shouldn't look to little people like myself to carry the torch or the banner, the standard, the signet.
[00:40:30.651 --> 00:40:32.272]  That really, you're looking in the mirror.
[00:40:32.292 --> 00:40:33.753]  You're looking at the solution right there.
[00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:36.935]  God made you be a leader, to stand up.
[00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:40.637]  And I'm excited to see so many of you taking action.
[00:40:41.918 --> 00:40:42.998]  All the things you've done.
[00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:45.740]  And I want to encourage you to do more.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.721]  Because it is empowering.
[00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:51.073]  It is enlightening.
[00:40:51.173 --> 00:40:52.194]  It is invigorating.
[00:40:52.274 --> 00:40:55.517]  It is... Well, I said it yesterday.
[00:40:56.618 --> 00:40:59.260]  Fear keeps you from fully committing to life.
[00:41:01.302 --> 00:41:02.923]  And I have fully committed to life.
[00:41:04.845 --> 00:41:05.585]  I know I have.
[00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:08.188]  I've committed as much as I can at this point.
[00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:10.309]  I get better at it every month, every year.
[00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:15.614]  Maybe it's kind of like after the big football game when you score the touchdown and
[00:41:16.209 --> 00:41:21.592]  When you get home the next day after the adrenaline rush, you get a little bummed out.
[00:41:21.652 --> 00:41:28.355]  Maybe it's what people talk about after they've been in a big battle, and they kind of take a break and they get the blues afterwards.
[00:41:29.675 --> 00:41:44.202]  I mean, really working really hard on Martial Law, my new film, working extremely hard until I expanded my black circles around my eyes and the wrinkles.
[00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:49.760]  That was invigorating, working that hard.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:42:11.934]  And then I guess after it's out and after that work's done and I see how many other hopes and dreams I have and things I want to do, but I want to try to impart my own meager knowledge and my thimble of wisdom that I see another mountain to climb and I... Oh, I'm being a wimp.
[00:42:13.315 --> 00:42:15.536]  But again, it's important to explore...
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.141]  Alex, three parts.
[00:42:17.161 --> 00:42:17.621]  Kudos to you.
[00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:18.202]  You're a warrior.
[00:42:18.222 --> 00:42:18.723]  Take a week off.
[00:42:18.763 --> 00:42:22.387]  Have Erskine and Jack come back.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.061]  And do the things that you want to do.
[00:42:38.081 --> 00:42:39.462]  But I've got so much work to do.
[00:42:39.722 --> 00:42:42.084]  I know, but... That wouldn't even be a week off.
[00:42:42.524 --> 00:42:43.965]  Well, and here's another thing.
[00:42:44.045 --> 00:42:46.547]  I know you love and obey Yahweh.
[00:42:47.027 --> 00:42:49.569]  Praise Yahweh and you'll get your joy back, too.
[00:42:49.989 --> 00:42:52.351]  Because this is just all temporary, this evil.
[00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:59.656]  It's predicted to happen and we're going to go through it, but we're warriors and we're in another kingdom.
[00:43:00.336 --> 00:43:02.578]  So I can look at all this stuff and...
[00:43:03.467 --> 00:43:09.370]  And say, well, this is the way it's prophesied to happen, but I'm not part of it.
[00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:10.771]  You're exposing it.
[00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:11.531]  You're a warrior.
[00:43:11.611 --> 00:43:12.672]  So that's part number one.
[00:43:12.852 --> 00:43:13.893]  Well, it's all transitory.
[00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:14.553]  Make your point.
[00:43:14.573 --> 00:43:14.833]  Yes.
[00:43:15.133 --> 00:43:27.059]  And now to Randy, if I may, advise him to go to VaticanDesignExposed.com and he could order a book.
[00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:29.681]  See, I had a copy of this book and I mailed it to Jack Blood.
[00:43:30.101 --> 00:43:31.822]  It's called America Betrayed.
[00:43:32.458 --> 00:43:36.101]  Brotherhood of Death, Crimes of Corporate High Treason.
[00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:40.664]  And it gets into the Prescott CIA, the Skull and Bones.
[00:43:41.144 --> 00:43:42.726]  It's very informative.
[00:43:43.706 --> 00:43:47.809]  I think he was asking where to find the news articles that are in the film.
[00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.712]  Oh, well, but that will give him a lot of information on the Bushes.
[00:43:52.193 --> 00:43:52.533]  Okay.
[00:43:52.733 --> 00:44:00.158]  And the third thing I wanted to say was, and I'm going to end with a question, did you know that President Bush signed in...
[00:44:01.477 --> 00:44:09.418]  Executive Order 13295, which gives the Department of Health the power to quarantine anyone with infectious diseases.
[00:44:09.578 --> 00:44:10.819]  Yeah, that was three weeks ago.
[00:44:10.839 --> 00:44:16.320]  Yeah, and do you think there's any connection between that and mailing out those viruses?
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.700]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:24.441]  And we talked about that last week with John Rappaport, who joined us.
[00:44:25.841 --> 00:44:28.842]  The whole flu thing was a fear-mongering tactic.
[00:44:29.805 --> 00:44:31.106]  They mailed it out on purpose.
[00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:32.647]  It wasn't even that big of a threat.
[00:44:33.707 --> 00:44:41.471]  But it does just show how haphazard and reckless they are with all of this while telling us to give up all of our freedoms.
[00:44:42.152 --> 00:44:44.193]  And that's just to create this background of fear.
[00:44:44.773 --> 00:44:49.956]  And, yes, through the medical system, I believe, is going to be where they really bring their tyranny to bear.
[00:44:49.976 --> 00:44:53.858]  I mean, look at the new Freedom Initiative, forced psychological testing, forced drugging.
[00:44:55.799 --> 00:44:57.600]  Look at all of it.
[00:45:00.084 --> 00:45:03.305]  Look at what they're doing with the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:08.608]  Look at how they're saying, oh, we're going to be hit by a bioweapon, and we're going to take all your rights away when it happens.
[00:45:09.428 --> 00:45:18.992]  Oh, the federal government has to certify you to be able to have a job if it's in key infrastructure positions, which are basically the entire economic structure.
[00:45:19.532 --> 00:45:19.832]  Yes.
[00:45:21.753 --> 00:45:23.113]  And we should talk about that more.
[00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:26.435]  I mean, they're declaring the power of kings.
[00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:29.136]  They're declaring the power of absolute dictatorship.
[00:45:29.196 --> 00:45:29.416]  I mean...
[00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:34.760]  Alberto Gonzalez, the Attorney General, says Bush is the law.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.141]  He says he is above all law.
[00:45:36.982 --> 00:45:39.143]  He is saying he is supreme dictator.
[00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:41.045]  I mean, he actually said that.
[00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:44.008]  In no uncertain terms.
[00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:47.470]  Let's talk to Michael in Florida.
[00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.051]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:45:48.732 --> 00:45:54.176]  Alex, man, I'm here to bring some energy to you today because I was feeling you were down, but listen, I've got to say something.
[00:45:54.196 --> 00:45:58.660]  This is kind of a message out to the listeners and really to the listeners' friends, okay?
[00:45:59.232 --> 00:46:06.217]  When you, as a person, go out to an amusement park, to a theme park, whatever, you don't have to put your finger on the biometrics when you're going into the park.
[00:46:06.677 --> 00:46:07.718]  They have them at all the parks.
[00:46:08.178 --> 00:46:09.539]  Orlando, Florida is where I live.
[00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:15.003]  They have the exact same scanner at SeaWorld as the one at SeaWorld when you were over there in Austin with your video camera.
[00:46:15.743 --> 00:46:19.006]  They have the same thing over at Walt Disney World and all the addresses.
[00:46:19.466 --> 00:46:20.427]  You don't have to do it.
[00:46:20.487 --> 00:46:25.030]  The only reason they're doing this is to get children and people in general to do
[00:46:25.669 --> 00:46:34.636]  Put these two things together in their minds that biometric scanners means happy, friendly places, and places where you have fun, and also you get kids into it at a very young age.
[00:46:35.377 --> 00:46:36.278]  You don't have to do it.
[00:46:36.418 --> 00:46:42.262]  And when I walk in, all I do is I show my ID, and the person barely even looks at my ID, and I just walk right through.
[00:46:42.282 --> 00:46:44.784]  So this has nothing to do with security.
[00:46:44.825 --> 00:46:48.167]  It has nothing to do with checking who you are or verifying who you are.
[00:46:48.688 --> 00:46:55.053]  Actually, when you walk through, you put your hand on the biometric scanner, they don't actually use any other form of identification to match that ID.
[00:46:55.575 --> 00:46:57.436]  To your thumbprint or to your handprint.
[00:46:58.156 --> 00:47:01.697]  It's just about putting a handprint down to get you used to doing it.
[00:47:01.737 --> 00:47:04.338]  No, that's the funny part is it isn't even 4ID.
[00:47:04.718 --> 00:47:06.018]  I'm so glad you mentioned this.
[00:47:06.178 --> 00:47:07.399]  It's somewhere on the website.
[00:47:07.439 --> 00:47:17.302]  I would just type SeaWorld Alex Jones into a search engine and a link to the video that's on InfoWars.com should pop up.
[00:47:17.702 --> 00:47:20.983]  There I was two years ago thinking I'd go to SeaWorld.
[00:47:21.003 --> 00:47:22.643]  I hadn't been there since I was a child.
[00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:24.424]  There I am with my
[00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:32.838]  Well, people look at the scanners, you know, I kind of see them turn, and they look at them funny, and they almost look at the scanners like if it's going to
[00:47:51.752 --> 00:47:52.773]  Stick something in your finger.
[00:47:53.013 --> 00:47:55.975]  People put their hands in a real hesitant manner.
[00:47:56.376 --> 00:48:00.679]  Well, let me comment on what you said, because people's instincts know this is bad.
[00:48:01.577 --> 00:48:03.518]  And the globalists in their own white papers.
[00:48:03.538 --> 00:48:04.338]  I mean, these are public.
[00:48:04.458 --> 00:48:11.221]  Brag about how they're going to put biometrics in, how you're going to use it to buy and sell, how it's going to be part of the national sales tax.
[00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:16.123]  And over a thousand school districts, no cash allowed, you must thumbprint to get food.
[00:48:16.823 --> 00:48:18.104]  As you said, training the youth.
[00:48:18.524 --> 00:48:24.186]  Now every major amusement park that I've read about, and I've been to a few, it's there.
[00:48:24.967 --> 00:48:26.327]  And we've just got to say no.
[00:48:27.047 --> 00:48:28.888]  And you're absolutely right, folks.
[00:48:29.168 --> 00:48:31.009]  And you're absolutely right, Mike.
[00:48:31.621 --> 00:48:32.701]  Yeah, and one more thing, Alex.
[00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:42.484]  Look, if you're going to go on vacation, the biggest thing I suggest, and this works for me, is you've got to go to a place like Clearwater, Florida, or the Florida Keys, where there's no chemtrail spraying.
[00:48:42.884 --> 00:48:51.667]  Because whenever I try to go on vacation and relax, and like you said, lay out in the park or lay out on the beach, and you look overhead, and you're getting sprayed like a bug, it just infuriates you, and you can't relax.
[00:48:52.167 --> 00:48:56.788]  So places like the Keys, places like Clearwater, Florida, minimal to no chemtrail spraying,
[00:48:57.972 --> 00:49:01.713]  That's the best advice I can give, because I know if you go on vacation, you have to see that garbage the whole time.
[00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:02.433]  It's going to drive you nuts.
[00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.514]  No, I don't think I'm going on vacation.
[00:49:05.654 --> 00:49:06.615]  I appreciate the call.
[00:49:07.415 --> 00:49:09.996]  I just have to try to balance it out.
[00:49:10.376 --> 00:49:18.098]  I mean, literally, folks, I just cannot continue to work every day until midnight or 2 a.m.
[00:49:19.358 --> 00:49:24.380]  and then get up at 7, 8 o'clock in the morning.
[00:49:25.758 --> 00:49:30.540]  Or then work until 3 in the morning and get up at 9 and try to rush and get ready for my radio show.
[00:49:33.341 --> 00:49:35.241]  Normally, you know me, I never whine on air.
[00:49:35.841 --> 00:49:40.183]  Mainly I'm just talking about the process of what it's like to work this much.
[00:49:41.563 --> 00:49:44.704]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rodney in Texas.
[00:49:44.764 --> 00:49:45.485]  Rodney, go ahead.
[00:49:45.905 --> 00:49:46.725]  Alex, how are you?
[00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:47.205]  Good.
[00:49:48.306 --> 00:49:52.667]  Actually, I thought that you were pretty upbeat until you booed me and told me that you weren't.
[00:49:53.698 --> 00:49:55.018]  I'm actually feeling pretty upbeat.
[00:49:55.178 --> 00:49:58.699]  I mean, comparatively, I've got more energy than most people right now.
[00:49:59.299 --> 00:50:00.540]  I just am so sick of it.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:06.621]  It's like, I mean, look, normally I would love to be interviewed by national TV.
[00:50:07.381 --> 00:50:11.302]  And now I just, maybe familiarity breeds contempt.
[00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.102]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:50:12.822 --> 00:50:17.624]  I want to commend you because I listened to your interview that you did on national public radio.
[00:50:17.684 --> 00:50:19.464]  And, man, it was like listening to a,
[00:50:20.262 --> 00:50:21.625]  You ever seen those fencers?
[00:50:21.945 --> 00:50:23.969]  You know, a master class fencer?
[00:50:23.989 --> 00:50:26.734]  That's enough frustration.
[00:50:26.894 --> 00:50:31.643]  I can only... I hate to use a vulgar term, but I can only...
[00:50:32.466 --> 00:50:35.689]  Get aroused when I'm facing the enemy.
[00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.932]  Frankly, I'm much better on other people's radio shows than I am on my own.
[00:50:40.473 --> 00:50:41.814]  Especially when they're attacking me.
[00:50:42.694 --> 00:50:48.459]  But it does get me crackling and my brain operating at higher levels when I'm being attacked.
[00:50:48.839 --> 00:50:49.120]  Stay there.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.081]  I'll let you finish up whatever you've got to talk about, Rodney.
[00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:57.707]  And we'll talk to Mike and many, many others that are patiently holding when we get back.
[00:50:57.727 --> 00:50:58.107]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.403 --> 00:51:05.747]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.927 --> 00:51:10.352]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.512 --> 00:51:14.876]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.916 --> 00:51:16.258]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.059 --> 00:51:22.282]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.342 --> 00:51:29.288]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.388 --> 00:51:31.469]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:42.158]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.418 --> 00:51:46.621]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State

[00:52:01.071 --> 00:52:04.972]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.192 --> 00:52:10.634]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:21.258]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:25.759]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.959 --> 00:52:34.305]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:40.930]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:41.310]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:08.153]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[00:53:33.509 --> 00:53:34.070]  We're good to go.
[00:54:06.002 --> 00:54:07.903]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.383 --> 00:54:11.225]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.766 --> 00:54:26.954]  When you're being interviewed by something, say like 2020 or National Public Radio, you've got to know that they interview you for maybe, for TV, four hours and then you're a minute.
[00:54:28.355 --> 00:54:35.659]  Or with the case of National Public Radio, they interviewed me for 30 minutes, cut me down to four minutes, two minutes of it, the host attacking me.
[00:54:37.461 --> 00:54:50.752]  And then they gave the CIA-connected editor of Popular Mechanics, who was viciously libeling me, they gave him 20 minutes, unedited.
[00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:54.235]  So that's what they do.
[00:54:55.375 --> 00:55:00.480]  That's the type of deck stacked against you, you know, cheating.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:05.904]  Of course, they tell you you're getting equal time, and of course, when the show airs, you don't get equal time.
[00:55:07.336 --> 00:55:08.577]  It's disgusting.
[00:55:09.457 --> 00:55:17.741]  So when you're doing one of those interviews, everything you say has to basically be a soundbite and repeated over and over again.
[00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:26.544]  I don't think I did a very good job on that particular NPR interview you're mentioning, but you heard it, so we can get your opinion on that.
[00:55:26.605 --> 00:55:28.445]  But what else is on your mind, Rodney?
[00:55:29.106 --> 00:55:29.326]  Well...
[00:55:30.709 --> 00:55:31.649]  A couple of stories.
[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:37.132]  The deal with the 18 persons being released from Guantanamo.
[00:55:37.572 --> 00:55:43.294]  And what I want you to comment on was the wording in the New York Times.
[00:55:43.394 --> 00:55:54.399]  It says they decided to release these enemy combatants because they decided they were no longer, no longer enemy combatants.
[00:55:54.439 --> 00:55:55.099]  Your comments?
[00:55:56.542 --> 00:55:58.863]  Well, that means they were never enemy combatants.
[00:55:59.123 --> 00:56:00.044]  I mean, even the L.A.
[00:56:00.064 --> 00:56:05.726]  Times reported no even mid-level member of Taliban, much less al-Qaeda, was at that base.
[00:56:05.786 --> 00:56:07.727]  They flew all the real Taliban and al-Qaeda.
[00:56:08.027 --> 00:56:09.427]  Our government did, out of safety.
[00:56:09.748 --> 00:56:11.088]  They worked for the CIA.
[00:56:11.488 --> 00:56:21.993]  They grabbed low-level nobodies to practice torture on them and to give the theatrical illusion that our government's fighting terror and to set the precedent of flying even citizens out of the U.S.
[00:56:22.033 --> 00:56:22.533]  for torture.
[00:56:23.053 --> 00:56:25.254]  And then they redefine torture as not being torture.
[00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:30.758]  I mean, Gonzales says if you torture somebody until they die, it's not torture.
[00:56:30.978 --> 00:56:31.198]  Right.
[00:56:31.538 --> 00:56:33.820]  I mean, he actually says killing someone's not torture.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:34.720]  Yeah.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:39.583]  I mean, okay, so... Very few newspapers bring that up.
[00:56:39.783 --> 00:56:43.765]  So it's not that they're innocent, just we decide they're no longer enemy combatants.
[00:56:43.845 --> 00:56:44.566]  Right, right.
[00:56:45.526 --> 00:56:49.289]  Finally, another article, and this is for all the individuals out there who are...
[00:56:50.049 --> 00:56:52.851]  Standing in line racing to get these hybrid cars.
[00:56:52.911 --> 00:57:11.125]  I just read out of the San Francisco Chronicle Nation section that any of these hybrid cars that you buy now, they have these chips in the odometer, which will determine how much mileage you actually drive in the car and put some type of surtax on there.
[00:57:11.145 --> 00:57:17.650]  So you're not actually saving any money because they're charging you not only for your gasoline, but also the
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:26.243]  I don't know the particulars of what you discussed, but I know they are planning to go ahead and start taxing, and they're putting the stuff in all the cars.
[00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:26.783]  Right.
[00:57:26.823 --> 00:57:32.185]  Well, that article is in today's section, if you want to go and... I'm just kind of glossing over it.
[00:57:32.205 --> 00:57:32.825]  The section of what?
[00:57:33.545 --> 00:57:37.246]  The San Francisco Chronicle, the nation section.
[00:57:37.426 --> 00:57:37.947]  Email it.
[00:57:38.487 --> 00:57:39.027]  Email it to me.
[00:57:39.047 --> 00:57:39.647]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:45.829]  Send it to tips at infowars.com, or go to prisonplanet.com and email Paul, and we'll get that posted.
[00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:47.610]  That sounds about right.
[00:57:48.706 --> 00:57:50.828]  We're almost out of time for this hour.
[00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:53.410]  I'm just going to spend 45 seconds on this.
[00:57:53.530 --> 00:58:00.156]  If you want to hurt the globalists, if you're tired of their lies and their stacked decks, you are the equalizers.
[00:58:00.316 --> 00:58:01.197]  You have the power.
[00:58:02.538 --> 00:58:04.560]  And the new film, Martial Law, is out.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.842]  I hope you'll all call and get it right now.
[00:58:07.643 --> 00:58:09.905]  It really can have an effect if you get the video.
[00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:12.890]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or order via InfoWars.com.
[00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:19.194]  We've got a lot of new great designer t-shirts as well, made right here in America.
[00:58:19.214 --> 00:58:23.536]  I know you may not order now because it's not made in China, but okay.
[00:58:23.556 --> 00:58:24.037]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:24.057 --> 00:58:25.398]  Please get Martial Law.
[00:58:25.438 --> 00:58:26.058]  Please make copies of it.
[00:58:37.262 --> 00:58:37.742]  Please.
[00:58:38.262 --> 00:58:39.102]  It will have an effect.
[00:58:39.543 --> 00:58:41.943]  You know, my real frustration is I can't do it all.
[00:58:43.003 --> 00:58:46.444]  Frankly, that's the heart of why I'm angry.
[00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:48.765]  I just can't do enough.
[00:58:48.905 --> 00:58:49.525]  But you can.
[00:58:51.405 --> 00:58:51.705]  Terror!
[00:58:51.765 --> 00:58:53.926]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:03.256]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.997 --> 00:59:04.877]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.557 --> 00:59:09.218]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.739 --> 00:59:13.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.614 --> 00:59:33.236]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now into our number two.
[00:59:34.717 --> 00:59:37.758]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we've got a top futurist coming on.
[00:59:37.798 --> 00:59:39.359]  He's also a former IBM executive.
[00:59:39.679 --> 00:59:41.780]  He says we're all going to have microchips very, very soon.
[00:59:41.821 --> 00:59:42.701]  It's all going to be wonderful.
[00:59:43.501 --> 00:59:46.743]  Once we have our chips, we'll be happy little members of the New World Order.
[00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:53.347]  And we also come up here in about five minutes, have Benjamin Godfrey and Shane Patrick.
[00:59:53.407 --> 00:59:53.847]  They won.
[00:59:54.699 --> 01:00:02.662]  The ArnoldExpose.com $2,000 prize for the best 60-second video PSA.
[01:00:03.822 --> 01:00:05.503]  I aired that last night on the TV show.
[01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.984]  It's on ArnoldExpose.com right now.
[01:00:09.444 --> 01:00:21.868]  Also, Adam and Aaron Gulley, they won the best 60-second audio ad for radio.
[01:00:21.908 --> 01:00:23.349]  And we got so many good ones.
[01:00:24.389 --> 01:00:35.453]  But I told people that it can't have audio of Schwarzenegger out of any of his movies.
[01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:38.994]  It can't.
[01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:44.236]  So a lot of you got disqualified because of that.
[01:00:44.276 --> 01:00:47.537]  But we can certainly put all that stuff on the web, and we're going to be doing that.
[01:00:47.697 --> 01:00:49.438]  But more details on that coming up.
[01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.738]  A lot of exciting things going on.
[01:00:51.758 --> 01:00:53.219]  Of course, I produced my own little ad.
[01:00:54.787 --> 01:00:56.147]  And it's going to be aired.
[01:00:57.007 --> 01:00:59.808]  I'm buying TV time right now to air it in different parts of the country.
[01:01:00.568 --> 01:01:05.089]  So that's now happening, and then that will be up today as well, by this afternoon, by later today, this evening.
[01:01:05.889 --> 01:01:07.850]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.210]  Let's talk to Mike in Indiana.
[01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.990]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.330]  Welcome.
[01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.110]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:13.391]  How are you doing, sir?
[01:01:13.471 --> 01:01:15.631]  Your word is really catching on like wildfire.
[01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:17.611]  Are you familiar with Michael Medved?
[01:01:18.932 --> 01:01:19.312]  Yeah, I know.
[01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:20.292]  He routinely attacks me.
[01:01:21.182 --> 01:01:22.263]  Well, he's very popular.
[01:01:22.563 --> 01:01:24.343]  Getting darn close to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:27.985]  A caller last Friday, April 15th, hit him up.
[01:01:28.025 --> 01:01:29.945]  He must have fooled the call screener.
[01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:31.206]  He really nailed him.
[01:01:31.226 --> 01:01:34.847]  He got him with the Larry Silverstein and the Building 7 thing.
[01:01:35.687 --> 01:01:38.188]  And Medved was like speechless and had to change the subject.
[01:01:39.649 --> 01:01:40.969]  You've got to have this sound bite.
[01:01:41.009 --> 01:01:42.370]  If I have to send it to you, I will.
[01:01:45.103 --> 01:01:49.008]  Oh, but Madden wasn't attacking me and saying I should be grabbed by Secret Service?
[01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:50.449]  No, no, no.
[01:01:50.509 --> 01:01:51.651]  This guy got in.
[01:01:51.691 --> 01:01:53.433]  He got through the call screener somehow.
[01:01:53.453 --> 01:01:54.474]  Some guy from Chicago.
[01:01:55.515 --> 01:01:56.476]  And did mention to Mike.
[01:01:56.516 --> 01:01:58.518]  Well, he was defending David Ray Griffin.
[01:01:58.538 --> 01:02:00.781]  I guess Mike had had him as a guest a few months ago.
[01:02:01.954 --> 01:02:02.714]  Oh, Medved had.
[01:02:03.034 --> 01:02:04.355]  Yeah, Medved had him as a guest.
[01:02:04.395 --> 01:02:10.836]  This guy was calling to defend him, and he said that Griffin's book was very well sourced, and Medved said, no, it wasn't.
[01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:14.057]  The guy said, what constitutes a good source to you?
[01:02:14.077 --> 01:02:15.617]  The sources he used were the U.S.
[01:02:15.657 --> 01:02:17.297]  government, NORAD testimony.
[01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:24.259]  And then he hit him up with the, he goes, how about a live interview with Larry Silverstein, who admitted that Building 7 was pulled?
[01:02:24.499 --> 01:02:26.599]  And Medved's like, what now?
[01:02:26.879 --> 01:02:29.800]  I thought, you know, there must have been red lights going off all over the studio then.
[01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.211]  No, I figured you were calling in because I know he routinely bashes me.
[01:02:34.711 --> 01:02:39.352]  We have a clip on the website where he's, Secret Service ought to get Alex Jones!
[01:02:40.153 --> 01:02:41.813]  And then I saw him in New York.
[01:02:42.453 --> 01:02:43.794]  He wasn't ready for this question.
[01:02:43.834 --> 01:02:44.974]  He had to change the subject.
[01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:46.314]  And then the guy mentioned it again.
[01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.495]  Two full times, clearly.
[01:02:48.655 --> 01:02:51.556]  I wish he'd have plugged a website so people could see Silverstein say it.
[01:02:51.576 --> 01:02:54.336]  Of course, that's in the new film, Martial Law, by the way.
[01:02:54.757 --> 01:02:55.377]  Right, right.
[01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:55.757]  But...
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.282]  This was the second call of Michael Medved's second hour.
[01:03:01.743 --> 01:03:03.364]  I think it's a soundbite you should have.
[01:03:03.684 --> 01:03:05.665]  So he was a stumbling, bumbling fool?
[01:03:06.805 --> 01:03:08.066]  Well, he was really caught off guard.
[01:03:08.086 --> 01:03:15.210]  Because, you know, his strategy is to divert the conversation and ask rhetorical questions and just get people when they do sneak in like that.
[01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:22.454]  I saw him in New York and inside the RNC and I walk over to interview him and he was pretty slick.
[01:03:22.474 --> 01:03:23.415]  He didn't want to be interviewed.
[01:03:23.435 --> 01:03:25.056]  I didn't put it in the film.
[01:03:25.076 --> 01:03:25.776]  It was just boring.
[01:03:26.184 --> 01:03:32.166]  He started just basically yelling, you know, implying, are you saying something about the president?
[01:03:32.466 --> 01:03:35.347]  Are you saying the president, are you saying that you're trying to get me in trouble?
[01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:37.768]  I just said, nah, just got out of there.
[01:03:38.188 --> 01:03:41.229]  Yeah, and then the guy even mentioned the phony left-right paradigm.
[01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:43.689]  I thought it had to be one of your listeners that called in.
[01:03:43.749 --> 01:03:44.410]  It just had to be.
[01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.130]  Good job to that listener.
[01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:48.391]  Good job for you calling in and telling us about it.
[01:03:48.411 --> 01:03:50.491]  If I send you the cassette, is it the Lamar address?
[01:03:50.772 --> 01:03:51.612]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:51.632 --> 01:03:51.892]  Thanks.
[01:03:52.992 --> 01:03:59.836]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.156 --> 01:04:01.517]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.717 --> 01:04:03.938]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.078 --> 01:04:06.160]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.382]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.703 --> 01:04:15.745]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:16.385]  We're good.
[01:04:34.175 --> 01:04:34.415]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:36.257]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:04:36.277 --> 01:04:37.098]  I'll give them that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:04:53.487 --> 01:04:57.990]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:02.432]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:03.273]  We listened.
[01:05:03.593 --> 01:05:08.576]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:08.836 --> 01:05:09.316]  We listened.
[01:05:09.717 --> 01:05:12.758]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.179 --> 01:05:13.699]  We listened.
[01:05:14.159 --> 01:05:18.242]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:18.602 --> 01:05:19.102]  We listened.
[01:05:19.443 --> 01:05:24.686]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:25.086 --> 01:05:26.447]  Again, we listened.

[01:05:52.225 --> 01:05:54.587]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:58.691]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:05:59.011 --> 01:05:59.812]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:04.376]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:04.596 --> 01:06:08.779]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:14.044]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.987]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:18.187 --> 01:06:23.531]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[01:06:41.604 --> 01:06:44.306]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.459 --> 01:07:14.387]  Coming up, folks, we've got Schedule, the futurist, former IBM executive, coming on to talk about how we're all going to be getting our microchips soon.
[01:07:14.407 --> 01:07:18.051]  It's going to be a lot of fun, and the New World Order loves you and your children.
[01:07:20.072 --> 01:07:28.220]  And I just briefly do want to remind listeners that in my new film, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State, we do detail.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.483]  We spend more time on Building 7 than anything else, and we cover...
[01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:39.263]  You know, for a full hour on 9-11, probably 15 minutes of that hour is just on Building 7 itself.
[01:07:40.564 --> 01:07:46.086]  And detailing, oh well, Larry Silverstein saying they blew it up, and then all the other news articles about it.
[01:07:47.126 --> 01:07:52.608]  So, and we go to Building 7, the new Building 7 they're building, and show you how they did it and why they did it.
[01:07:54.209 --> 01:07:57.590]  And it's such an important film, I hope people will get martial law, because
[01:07:58.859 --> 01:08:07.766]  My greatest desire is, when it comes to politics and waking this country up, is for people to get this film and to make copies of it, because it won't have the effect, it won't have any power.
[01:08:08.927 --> 01:08:12.510]  It won't be able to reach so many people through you.
[01:08:13.951 --> 01:08:19.636]  But nothing happens until you take action, until you put yourself in motion against the New World Order.
[01:08:20.216 --> 01:08:21.237]  And then we're unstoppable.
[01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:32.106]  So the toll-free number is 888-253-3139, or you can order via InfoWars.com, as I said earlier, or watch it all right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:32.186 --> 01:08:36.810]  All right, I want to spend the next five minutes or so, and then I'm going to give you some other news and take your calls.
[01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:42.133]  With Benjamin Godfrey and Shane Patu, these are great guys.
[01:08:42.173 --> 01:08:48.458]  In fact, I want to get them to do some work for me sometime in the future on a film or something.
[01:08:48.538 --> 01:08:51.100]  Really impressed about the work they did.
[01:08:52.509 --> 01:09:08.494]  Back in the last month or so of 2004, I decided to go up against Arnold A. Lewis Schwarzenegger because all of these powerful forces are trying to push to amend the Constitution so he can run for President.
[01:09:09.935 --> 01:09:11.615]  And it's all part of a larger plan.
[01:09:12.476 --> 01:09:15.437]  And that, of course, all was exposed in the new film, Martial Law.
[01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:19.598]  But I said that I was going to produce my own ad that I would air.
[01:09:20.848 --> 01:09:23.329]  In California and Texas, which I've done my new ad.
[01:09:23.369 --> 01:09:24.110]  It's going up today.
[01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:25.470]  We're going to be airing that.
[01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:43.580]  But I said also for the web, kind of like some of the other alternative news sites have done, they've had contests where they get people to make ads because you get so many great ideas and so much great work is done.
[01:09:44.617 --> 01:09:55.761]  And out of all the video entries we got, by far, and the others were great as well, by far the ad that Benjamin Godfrey and Shane Patrick created is the best.
[01:09:55.801 --> 01:10:02.084]  It's very visual, so we're not going to play the audio here on air because it's a mainly visual ad.
[01:10:03.124 --> 01:10:08.246]  But joining us to talk about it are Benjamin Godfrey and Shane Patrick.
[01:10:08.867 --> 01:10:10.187]  Gentlemen, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:11.227 --> 01:10:11.468]  Hey there.
[01:10:11.688 --> 01:10:12.308]  Good to be here.
[01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:22.598]  To both of you, Benjamin Godfrey and Shane Patrick, why did you guys decide to enter the contest?
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.521]  That's a good question.
[01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:30.223]  Who is this I'm talking to right now?
[01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:31.104]  This is Ben.
[01:10:31.124 --> 01:10:34.786]  Okay, because Ben, I've never talked to you, I've never talked to Shane, I believe.
[01:10:35.166 --> 01:10:36.887]  Unless you've called into the show without me knowing.
[01:10:37.287 --> 01:10:38.688]  So it's good to talk to you first off.
[01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.390]  Yeah, I think Shane's called into the show before.
[01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:41.770]  Okay.
[01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.930]  Okay.
[01:10:44.131 --> 01:10:52.315]  I guess, you know, we just wanted to do our part, and we figured we kind of have some experience, so maybe we could do something good that would work.
[01:10:54.076 --> 01:10:54.956]  Well, it's really nice.
[01:10:55.016 --> 01:11:03.560]  For those that don't know, I mean, who haven't seen the ad, tell us how you came up with the concept and kind of describe what people will see in the ad.
[01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.622]  Well, this is Shane.
[01:11:09.048 --> 01:11:15.571]  When it comes down to the general idea, it was just based on... Hey, Shane, are you in, like, a bathroom or something?
[01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:17.892]  No, I'm actually on my cell phone.
[01:11:18.392 --> 01:11:19.912]  Okay, well, wherever you were was bad.
[01:11:19.972 --> 01:11:20.593]  Now I can hear you.
[01:11:20.613 --> 01:11:21.553]  It was echoing real bad.
[01:11:21.733 --> 01:11:22.473]  Go ahead and start over.
[01:11:23.194 --> 01:11:35.479]  All right, well, the basic idea was just based on, like, the fascist countries and also the different comments that Arnold Schwarzenegger had made about...
[01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:45.184]  Wanting to be a dictator and wanting to be a figure like Jesus, comparing himself to... I'll tell you what we're going to do.
[01:11:46.484 --> 01:11:47.705]  We're talking to Shane right now.
[01:11:47.785 --> 01:11:48.666]  Fade Benjamin down.
[01:11:48.686 --> 01:11:50.307]  There's a lot of stuff going on in the background.
[01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:52.068]  We'll bring you guys up one at a time.
[01:11:52.488 --> 01:11:54.029]  I just want you guys to be able to be heard.
[01:11:54.349 --> 01:11:55.229]  Shane, please continue.
[01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:56.590]  All right, I'm sorry.
[01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:57.211]  That's all right.
[01:11:57.251 --> 01:11:57.551]  Go ahead.
[01:11:58.551 --> 01:12:02.994]  But it was just basically based on the many comments that Arnold Schwarzenegger had made about
[01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:29.387]  Wanting to be a dictator and admiring Hitler and wanting to be a figure like Jesus and just different things like that related to fascism that were comments that he actually made throughout his life not just in his younger years he made them throughout the 90s and even here recently whenever we were making it and looking for different comments that he had made I actually thought it would be really hard to find
[01:12:30.271 --> 01:12:36.076]  Some direct statements that he had made that would really implicate him and be that type of person.
[01:12:36.116 --> 01:12:38.638]  But when it came down to it, we had so many different statements.
[01:12:38.678 --> 01:12:44.323]  We included three different comments in text on there that he had said before.
[01:12:44.924 --> 01:12:51.389]  But there was a wealth of different things, probably about 10, 12 different comments he had made that were just over the top.
[01:12:51.549 --> 01:12:52.030]  They're really...
[01:12:52.705 --> 01:12:53.025]  Right, I agree.
[01:12:53.045 --> 01:12:57.506]  I mean, just based on everything that I've read and seen, and you had even mentioned before on the show,
[01:13:19.968 --> 01:13:26.872]  I think it was a 30-year plan or 50-year plan of his life.
[01:13:27.192 --> 01:13:30.754]  All of the things that he's done so far all fits to that plan.
[01:13:30.814 --> 01:13:34.596]  It ends up with him basically wanting to be ruler of the world.
[01:13:34.856 --> 01:13:36.597]  It looks like he's
[01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:40.497]  Kind of on the right track, and we do need to get involved and get the word out.
[01:13:40.597 --> 01:13:49.661]  But what's even scarier is that he has the government and the establishment loves him because he has this view because he's a pea in the pod with them.
[01:13:50.842 --> 01:13:51.302]  Definitely.
[01:13:52.183 --> 01:13:56.845]  Going to Benjamin Godfrey, just so I know, who is it?
[01:13:57.794 --> 01:14:10.944]  Is it one of you guys that I see walking in front of the camera, kind of in this 1984 atmosphere with soldiers, and then big huge posters of Arnold everywhere, and then you go into some type of government facility to get your food rations?
[01:14:11.004 --> 01:14:13.246]  I mean, this was like something out of Red Dawn.
[01:14:13.286 --> 01:14:15.388]  You guys really went over the top.
[01:14:16.028 --> 01:14:16.989]  Yeah, that would be me.
[01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:19.691]  Alright, so that's Benjamin Godfrey.
[01:14:20.252 --> 01:14:21.853]  Shane was working the camera.
[01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.975]  Well, you guys just did an amazing job.
[01:14:26.276 --> 01:14:27.957]  Obviously, you work in film.
[01:14:28.177 --> 01:14:30.959]  I mean, this isn't your first project.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.902]  We've done some little small things, but nothing big.
[01:14:34.942 --> 01:14:44.329]  But I do work as sort of a graphic artist doing animation and stuff like that professionally, but not like I don't do video projects.
[01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:48.172]  But I do have a skill set to work from.
[01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:51.535]  Do you guys have any websites you want to plug or anything?
[01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:59.100]  I have a website that we use, and we just put sort of art and stuff up on there.
[01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:01.042]  Well, give us your website.
[01:15:01.703 --> 01:15:03.325]  That one is starvinginhouston.com.
[01:15:04.326 --> 01:15:05.348]  Starving Houston?
[01:15:05.828 --> 01:15:06.870]  Starving in Houston.
[01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:08.652]  Starvinginhouston.com.
[01:15:08.973 --> 01:15:09.894]  Just sort of an art thing.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.506]  And then I did put a site up a little while back, like back before the election.
[01:15:16.927 --> 01:15:20.090]  I think I sent you a link to it, but I'm sure you're busy.
[01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:23.634]  I put some videos and stuff that I was able to come across on the Internet.
[01:15:24.034 --> 01:15:28.739]  I did put a short clip of Bohemian Grove on there, but it's kind of an interactive website.
[01:15:30.661 --> 01:15:32.103]  That was electiondeception.com.
[01:15:33.004 --> 01:15:34.464]  Oh, I've seen that site, yeah.
[01:15:34.504 --> 01:15:38.505]  Yeah, and it just takes you through all the different stuff, and at the end I just put links to where all the sources are.
[01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:40.786]  Well, that's a great URL to begin with.
[01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:42.746]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:15:42.786 --> 01:15:44.826]  Well, gentlemen, who do I write this $2,000 check to?
[01:15:44.866 --> 01:15:47.627]  You can just write it to me.
[01:15:48.247 --> 01:15:50.748]  I'm just going to give Shane his cut.
[01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:53.868]  Okay, well, so that's good with you, Shane.
[01:15:53.908 --> 01:15:55.929]  I'll send a check to Benjamin Godfrey.
[01:15:56.609 --> 01:15:57.269]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:15:57.808 --> 01:16:01.450]  Benjamin, I had the piece of paper that came with the DV tape you sent.
[01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.291]  Somehow I can't find it.
[01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:07.474]  Will you email me the address you want this sent to?
[01:16:08.074 --> 01:16:08.275]  Sure.
[01:16:09.035 --> 01:16:11.156]  Email that, and we'll send that out tonight or tomorrow.
[01:16:11.837 --> 01:16:13.638]  And anything else you gentlemen want to add?
[01:16:14.839 --> 01:16:15.519]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:15.559 --> 01:16:25.045]  If you have any, like you were saying before we came in, if you have any projects that you're working on, any web or video stuff, and you want us to throw a little creativity over there, just let us know.
[01:16:26.529 --> 01:16:26.970]  Definitely.
[01:16:27.571 --> 01:16:27.931]  All right.
[01:16:27.971 --> 01:16:37.602]  Well, you did a great job, and I think your ad is clean enough that I can probably actually use it on TV.
[01:16:38.603 --> 01:16:40.164]  I don't think it violates any copyright.
[01:16:40.405 --> 01:16:41.446]  I may be able to use it.
[01:16:42.607 --> 01:16:44.069]  And so if I do that, it's okay with you?
[01:16:45.069 --> 01:16:47.370]  Yeah, we're actually hoping it gets on TV.
[01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:48.131]  That would be great.
[01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:50.912]  Yeah, well, regardless, it's going to be seen by millions on the web.
[01:16:51.593 --> 01:16:53.694]  I don't have enough money to air it a lot on cable.
[01:16:54.034 --> 01:17:06.301]  The goal is to do what Morgenthaler Jones, Schwarzenegger's one of his top campaign people with her Amend for Arnold group, you know, she just bought $50,000 worth of ads in California.
[01:17:06.921 --> 01:17:08.242]  No, the interview with her was great.
[01:17:08.262 --> 01:17:08.562]  You did.
[01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:40.641]  Yeah, we're really hoping that this information is going to get out there through the Internet.
[01:17:40.721 --> 01:17:42.002]  I think a lot of people can get to it.
[01:17:42.022 --> 01:17:48.048]  I know that moveon.org got a lot of attention just through the Internet since they wouldn't let them air their ad on TV.
[01:17:49.529 --> 01:17:50.530]  Well, that's the question.
[01:17:50.550 --> 01:18:01.160]  I mean, I'm thinking they may even try to... We're getting some indications some cable systems may refuse my ad, and then we'll put a press release out on that, and that may get the ball rolling.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:10.027]  Yeah, I think a lot of people just need to get links to the videos on their blogs and on web portals, and then it'll get all over the place.
[01:18:10.068 --> 01:18:13.250]  You'll get tons of viewers, and then people will be aware.
[01:18:15.052 --> 01:18:23.539]  Well, Benjamin and Shane, I really appreciate your hard work, and I'm very impressed by the quality of your 30 and 60-second spots you made.
[01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:28.924]  It's bad news for the other people that entered the contest that you guys did such a good job of.
[01:18:29.525 --> 01:18:31.267]  Yeah, we're really looking forward to seeing their entries.
[01:18:31.727 --> 01:18:36.432]  But they're winners, too, because, you know, they're getting involved, and that's what matters.
[01:18:36.452 --> 01:18:37.252]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:37.993 --> 01:18:40.195]  All right, well, thank you, gentlemen, for all you do.
[01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:40.996]  Thank you.
[01:18:41.036 --> 01:18:41.316]  Thank you.
[01:18:41.636 --> 01:18:42.017]  Take care.
[01:18:42.037 --> 01:18:50.525]  All right, we'll come back, take a few calls, and we've got this futurist coming on, this former IBM exec, because he thinks implantable microchips are just wonderful.
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:59.483]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:18:59.643 --> 01:19:00.703]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:19:00.823 --> 01:19:01.704]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:04.645]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:19:04.845 --> 01:19:09.748]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:19:09.948 --> 01:19:11.068]  Check out this new product.
[01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:14.110]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:18.172]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:19:18.332 --> 01:19:18.492]  Look.
[01:19:18.692 --> 01:19:20.973]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[01:19:21.073 --> 01:19:26.176]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:19:26.196 --> 01:19:29.317]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[01:19:29.437 --> 01:19:34.840]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.700]  Try Nobio.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.780]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:19:37.961 --> 01:19:40.862]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:43.904]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[01:19:44.104 --> 01:19:46.525]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.

[01:20:52.984 --> 01:20:59.209]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:59.669 --> 01:21:07.435]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:07.776 --> 01:21:15.642]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:15.942 --> 01:21:16.583]  We're good to go.
[01:21:16.603 --> 01:21:17.043]  We're good to go.
[01:21:44.082 --> 01:21:46.204]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.344 --> 01:21:49.306]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.326 --> 01:21:56.111]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.993]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[01:21:59.193 --> 01:22:00.574]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:10.701]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[01:22:10.881 --> 01:22:12.602]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[01:22:12.882 --> 01:22:16.765]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[01:22:16.985 --> 01:22:21.408]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:22:21.608 --> 01:22:25.451]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:31.876]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:22:32.076 --> 01:22:34.878]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[01:22:35.058 --> 01:22:38.440]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.303]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[01:22:42.483 --> 01:22:46.346]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:22:46.566 --> 01:22:50.869]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:22:55.512 --> 01:23:01.536]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.157 --> 01:23:05.099]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:11.505 --> 01:23:14.748]  We're just beginning our move against Schwarzenegger.
[01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:20.912]  And that's another one of my frustrations.
[01:23:20.992 --> 01:23:26.336]  I mean, it's going to take time to promote these ads, to get them on, but then try to force the media to cover them.
[01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:29.819]  And there's just so many irons in the fire.
[01:23:29.859 --> 01:23:36.604]  But it's really invigorating and exciting to see this project come into fruition, though it took longer than I thought.
[01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:41.068]  And to see the great job that everybody out there has done
[01:23:42.088 --> 01:23:43.469]  But I do want to commend those gentlemen.
[01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:51.156]  And really, nothing can stop this program being effective, this program against Schwarzenegger.
[01:23:51.196 --> 01:24:04.807]  If you, the listeners, take action, so please go to arnoldexposed.com, get the URL, the download point for the 60-second is the best anti-Schwarzenegger ad, and please make sure it gets out across the Internet.
[01:24:05.547 --> 01:24:07.709]  You are unstoppable if you'll simply take action.
[01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:09.751]  But again, the power is in your hands.
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.701]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:24:13.242 --> 01:24:14.502]  Matthew in Texas.
[01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:15.403]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[01:24:15.423 --> 01:24:16.243]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:16.283 --> 01:24:16.663]  How you doing?
[01:24:16.784 --> 01:24:17.064]  Good.
[01:24:18.004 --> 01:24:19.345]  I'm sitting here in front of me.
[01:24:19.525 --> 01:24:26.529]  I bought at the Salvation Army a directory for Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, the alumni directory.
[01:24:26.869 --> 01:24:30.491]  I was wondering if that was the same thing as Skull and Bones or like a branch of it.
[01:24:32.573 --> 01:24:33.793]  No, I don't believe so.
[01:24:34.134 --> 01:24:39.877]  Well, in the directory, there's Bush and his father...
[01:24:41.058 --> 01:24:41.499]  D.W.
[01:24:41.539 --> 01:24:44.200]  Bush and H.W.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.281]  Bush are both in here.
[01:24:46.982 --> 01:24:49.623]  There's a bunch of interesting stuff in here.
[01:24:49.663 --> 01:24:53.945]  There's a career networking guide, and also there's some songs.
[01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:58.528]  One of the songs, there's a little excerpt right here.
[01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:02.390]  Our torches flash in every lady's eye.
[01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:05.832]  Our trembling victims await our call as we go marching on.
[01:25:08.163 --> 01:25:11.085]  I didn't think it was Skull and Bones because I couldn't find Carrie's name in it.
[01:25:11.325 --> 01:25:13.766]  I know that's an elite fraternity.
[01:25:14.566 --> 01:25:19.488]  Why don't you Xerox copy the cover on that page and mail that to me?
[01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:20.089]  Oh, I will.
[01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:23.890]  Say that again, though, our trembling victims.
[01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:32.074]  It's the marching song, and the excerpt I have is, Our torches flash in every lady's eye.
[01:25:32.174 --> 01:25:36.916]  Our trembling victims await our call as we go marching on, singing Delta Kappa Epsilon.
[01:25:38.499 --> 01:25:42.982]  Well, I mean, look, Skull & Bones is more than a fraternity, 15 members each year.
[01:25:43.382 --> 01:25:43.562]  Right.
[01:25:43.842 --> 01:25:50.206]  But all of these are good old boy networks, secret societies, you know, networks to help each other.
[01:25:51.067 --> 01:25:56.350]  But people try to compare Skull & Bones to a fraternity, and that's not really what it is.
[01:25:56.971 --> 01:25:57.191]  Right.
[01:25:57.431 --> 01:25:59.032]  I mean, in the classical sense.
[01:25:59.572 --> 01:26:02.534]  Well, the members of this fraternity, there's four U.S.
[01:26:02.614 --> 01:26:03.975]  presidents, actually five now.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.121]  This was published in 1994.
[01:26:06.221 --> 01:26:09.184]  Presidents Hayes, Bush, Roosevelt, and Ford.
[01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.444]  Dick Clark is a member.
[01:26:10.725 --> 01:26:13.947]  There's also another song that's called We Hail the Holy Goddess.
[01:26:15.268 --> 01:26:19.171]  Yeah, they do worship a goddess at the tomb.
[01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:19.811]  Yeah.
[01:26:21.012 --> 01:26:23.654]  Well, it's all no big deal.
[01:26:23.994 --> 01:26:26.176]  See how this occultism is hidden right in front of us?
[01:26:26.336 --> 01:26:26.716]  That's it.
[01:26:26.736 --> 01:26:29.258]  I mean, it's all occultic, and it's just hidden right there.
[01:26:29.298 --> 01:26:29.939]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:30.199]  Sure.
[01:26:30.399 --> 01:26:31.740]  Really good points, Matthew.
[01:26:32.546 --> 01:26:35.147]  When we go into these courts, we pray to the judge.
[01:26:35.747 --> 01:26:39.649]  In your pleadings, it says we pray to the court.
[01:26:39.909 --> 01:26:41.050]  They're built like temples.
[01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:44.011]  It's all hidden in plain view, folks.
[01:26:45.152 --> 01:26:47.313]  Let's talk to Clyde in Colorado.
[01:26:47.333 --> 01:26:48.053]  Clyde, welcome.
[01:26:49.013 --> 01:26:49.473]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:49.493 --> 01:26:53.555]  I think probably prayer is in order for both you and your family and people in the network.
[01:26:54.356 --> 01:26:59.618]  You may, as you've indicated, are facing some difficult decisions as to what direction you might want to go.
[01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.989]  Oh, no.
[01:27:01.009 --> 01:27:08.371]  I mean, today I was just openly on air talking about frustration, not being able to do enough work, not being able to get it all done.
[01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:10.732]  And when I do get it done, not being able to do it right.
[01:27:12.232 --> 01:27:18.814]  And mainly I'm frustrated because I know how to defeat the New World Order and how to really expose them.
[01:27:19.654 --> 01:27:23.255]  I just can't do it all, and you can't just hire more people and tell them what to do.
[01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:30.691]  I mean, you've got to specifically do it a specific way, and it's just us... I'm just sharing my frustration.
[01:27:31.092 --> 01:27:34.154]  I understand that.
[01:27:34.174 --> 01:27:38.098]  I, 25 years ago, began to be aware of what you might call the New World Order.
[01:27:38.118 --> 01:27:49.769]  I started reading Scripture, and I went through a period of time which had a high level of frustration, and then I'm going to read a Scripture in which the Lord said the battle ultimately is His.
[01:27:50.572 --> 01:27:54.075]  It didn't mean that I didn't continue on in the battle.
[01:27:54.855 --> 01:27:57.618]  It's just that he reduced my frustration level.
[01:27:58.018 --> 01:28:00.200]  You know, it's a classic bittersweet situation.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:04.463]  It's a matter of selecting priorities from priorities, and that's probably what you're facing.
[01:28:05.023 --> 01:28:06.324]  They're all important.
[01:28:06.384 --> 01:28:06.885]  Yes, they are.
[01:28:07.205 --> 01:28:07.786]  Yes, they are.
[01:28:07.886 --> 01:28:16.693]  But ultimately, some peace will come to your life or any individual's life, I think, when we realize the battle ultimately is.
[01:28:17.133 --> 01:28:18.814]  I have predominant peace.
[01:28:19.014 --> 01:28:19.355]  I just...
[01:28:21.178 --> 01:28:21.438]  I don't know.
[01:28:21.498 --> 01:28:22.579]  It's a complex issue.
[01:28:22.699 --> 01:28:23.699]  Well, prayer is an order for you.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.120]  Well, thank you.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.521]  Prayer is always important.
[01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:26.941]  Thank you.
[01:28:27.842 --> 01:28:34.105]  We should pray for this country, pray for every individual on this planet, and we should also pray for each other.
[01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:35.345]  I mean, I appreciate it.
[01:28:35.365 --> 01:28:36.266]  Your prayers are vital.
[01:28:37.046 --> 01:28:37.887]  All right.
[01:28:38.867 --> 01:28:39.948]  We've got a big guest coming up.
[01:28:39.988 --> 01:28:40.528]  He's scheduled.
[01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.188]  We'll see what happens.
[01:28:43.309 --> 01:28:44.190]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:46.311]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.211 --> 01:28:49.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.419 --> 01:29:00.903]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.324 --> 01:29:05.567]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.787 --> 01:29:12.833]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.213 --> 01:29:19.318]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.478 --> 01:29:20.679]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:20.859 --> 01:29:23.041]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:40.933]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:29:40.953 --> 01:29:41.053]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.073 --> 01:29:41.173]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:42.133]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.193 --> 01:29:42.453]  Call today.
[01:29:53.095 --> 01:29:53.716]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:53.796 --> 01:29:54.716]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:58.940]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.982]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.042 --> 01:30:08.767]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:08.947 --> 01:30:11.970]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.552]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:14.692 --> 01:30:22.798]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apt
[01:30:22.858 --> 01:30:24.818]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[01:32:13.473 --> 01:32:17.696]  They pull this a lot, especially when they find out who I am.
[01:32:17.716 --> 01:32:20.358]  Or we might have gotten the time, so I'm screwed up.
[01:32:20.398 --> 01:32:21.238]  You never know around here.
[01:32:22.299 --> 01:32:31.045]  But Wolfgang Grohlke, the IBM futurist New World Order minion, is not on with us yet, but we'll continue to try.
[01:32:31.165 --> 01:32:33.066]  Normally, we're still able to get him.
[01:32:34.247 --> 01:32:43.073]  Chairman and founder of Future World and former IBM executive, he worked internationally with IBM for more than 20 years and was awarded,
[01:32:43.726 --> 01:32:52.772]  The prestigious IBM Outstanding Innovation Award from then-CEO John Akers, I guess you pronounce it, in London in 1983.
[01:32:52.892 --> 01:33:01.078]  And we'll close that microphone, and then we will get into the news here.
[01:33:01.718 --> 01:33:03.179]  This is out of the City Morning Herald.
[01:33:03.339 --> 01:33:06.661]  We'll be able to watch television on our eyelids.
[01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:08.322]  That's one of the headlines here.
[01:33:08.342 --> 01:33:10.564]  Here's another one out of The Age.
[01:33:11.104 --> 01:33:13.486]  Facing the future with a chip in the shoulder.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.101]  And he just says we're all going to have chips.
[01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:23.885]  It says, Futurist Wolfgang Grolke says microchipping will be common in 10 years replacing mobile phones.
[01:33:25.145 --> 01:33:29.588]  Forget mobile phones as the hottest new media technology for anyone under 30.
[01:33:30.008 --> 01:33:32.829]  Handsets, as we know them, will be gone in 20 years.
[01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:38.152]  The world's tech-savvy youngsters will be using microchip implants to communicate and transact.
[01:33:39.033 --> 01:33:41.754]  And, of course, they'll have the Hollywood crowd pitch it, as I said they would.
[01:33:43.234 --> 01:33:44.474]  That's in the government documents from 2000.
[01:33:44.514 --> 01:33:58.539]  The microchip movement is one of dozens forward-looking scenarios that some of Australia's major companies got a fix on this week, courtesy of Network 10's innovation and future scoping program.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:08.243]  If the microchip scenario sounds too much like Star Trek episode, London nuclear physicist, marine biologist, and futurist Wolfgang Grohlke has news.
[01:34:08.283 --> 01:34:09.243]  It's already happening.
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:16.185]  And yeah, all the beautiful girls at these nightclubs, they want to work there as the bikini girls.
[01:34:16.225 --> 01:34:17.305]  They've got to have the chip.
[01:34:17.365 --> 01:34:20.348]  And oh, you want to work at the Mexican Attorney General's office?
[01:34:20.368 --> 01:34:21.509]  You've got to have the chip.
[01:34:22.529 --> 01:34:23.370]  You want to be a prisoner?
[01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:24.150]  You've got to have a chip.
[01:34:24.171 --> 01:34:25.151]  You want to be Special Forces?
[01:34:25.171 --> 01:34:25.972]  You've got to have a chip.
[01:34:26.272 --> 01:34:27.813]  You want to be a combat pilot?
[01:34:27.833 --> 01:34:28.994]  You've got to have a chip.
[01:34:29.074 --> 01:34:30.095]  Oh, but it's classified.
[01:34:30.135 --> 01:34:30.875]  Don't talk about it.
[01:34:32.537 --> 01:34:33.818]  It's already here, folks.
[01:34:33.838 --> 01:34:34.758]  It's already happening.
[01:34:34.778 --> 01:34:36.840]  It does absolutely nothing.
[01:34:37.853 --> 01:34:40.554]  Frankly, biometrics, if you want to use them, are much better.
[01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:45.636]  For thumb scanning and face scanning and systems like that can't be taken away from you.
[01:34:46.116 --> 01:34:47.837]  Can't be zapped, can't be turned off.
[01:34:47.877 --> 01:34:57.021]  The chips can, but they want the chips because they're going to have other things in them and it sets the precedent to forcibly put things in our body, which they're already doing through all these new vaccine laws.
[01:34:59.413 --> 01:35:11.721]  But the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:35:12.421 --> 01:35:15.003]  Let's talk to who's up next here?
[01:35:17.704 --> 01:35:18.665]  Eric in California.
[01:35:18.705 --> 01:35:19.385]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:35:19.786 --> 01:35:20.326]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:35:20.366 --> 01:35:21.226]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:35:21.286 --> 01:35:26.950]  Hey, I want to first, I just want to say I'm actually quite shocked how you're able to predict
[01:35:27.645 --> 01:35:28.405]  The next Pope.
[01:35:28.506 --> 01:35:33.588]  I thought you guys were a little kooky in trying to decide who will be next, but I'm utterly shocked.
[01:35:33.648 --> 01:35:35.089]  How are you guys able to do that?
[01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:42.313]  Well, I don't want to take credit for other people's predictions, so I didn't predict that.
[01:35:43.254 --> 01:35:46.375]  I heard some of the other broadcasts predict it.
[01:35:48.396 --> 01:35:50.998]  I think Jack Blood predicted it.
[01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:55.048]  Well, I mean, I just came across the Enforced.com and it said,
[01:36:10.862 --> 01:36:14.524]  I remember reading earlier before today, or I think it was yesterday.
[01:36:14.664 --> 01:36:18.166]  Yeah, we posted articles predicting him.
[01:36:18.426 --> 01:36:19.987]  But we didn't make those predictions.
[01:36:21.088 --> 01:36:21.828]  Other people did.
[01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:29.192]  But you could say in a roundabout way, I mean, we selected things that we thought were good analysis and opposed them.
[01:36:29.645 --> 01:36:45.614]  Okay, but the last thing is that the chips, is there any way we can really, I mean I know we can get the word out, I called before about how we can find the New World Order, but when it comes time to get the chips, do you think there will be any legal consequences or it can be all the way to concentration camps?
[01:36:46.414 --> 01:36:55.139]  No, it'll just be, sorry, you don't get to have a cell phone or a data cube or whatever it's called at that point if you don't have the access security chip.
[01:36:55.399 --> 01:36:58.241]  So fine, you don't have to have the chip.
[01:36:58.301 --> 01:36:59.762]  You just won't be able to do business.
[01:36:59.862 --> 01:37:06.986]  Oh, sorry, every business in America demands that you have the data cube, which to have the data cube, you've got to have the chip.
[01:37:07.566 --> 01:37:12.309]  The data cube will be kind of like a nexus point for this whole matrix grid.
[01:37:13.726 --> 01:37:17.267]  So it's basically like the mark of the... It's like this, look.
[01:37:18.167 --> 01:37:25.410]  Six years before 2001, they passed federal law and paid the cell phone makers $7 million as a payoff.
[01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:32.852]  To buy law, every cell phone would have to have this chip in it that triangulates with the cell towers via GPS.
[01:37:33.232 --> 01:37:39.814]  It also, even when it's off, can listen to you, audibly, the audio itself, as a bug.
[01:37:40.732 --> 01:37:44.477]  And number one, the media never really reported on it, so people don't believe it exists.
[01:37:44.517 --> 01:37:49.263]  Then when they finally did it, oh, well, you just don't have to have a cell phone.
[01:37:50.124 --> 01:37:55.089]  And then see, all the new cars have kill switches in them and have black boxes in them.
[01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:56.051]  I mean, all the new cars.
[01:37:57.094 --> 01:38:01.759]  Have the plug-ins for the transponders and the ID numbers for the toll roads.
[01:38:02.179 --> 01:38:05.102]  And then it's just, well, you don't have to have a car then.
[01:38:06.264 --> 01:38:08.146]  Or, well, you just don't have to have a job then.
[01:38:08.186 --> 01:38:10.948]  But then when you go on welfare, well, you've got to have the chip to be on welfare.
[01:38:11.249 --> 01:38:12.810]  Oh, we can't have homeless people on the street.
[01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:13.671]  You're going to have to be arrested.
[01:38:14.452 --> 01:38:16.254]  So, oh, there's terrorist cults.
[01:38:16.634 --> 01:38:17.395]  We're good to go.
[01:38:37.358 --> 01:38:41.185]  You know, they don't have a right to hold back societies moving forward!
[01:38:41.806 --> 01:38:46.214]  And they're connected to terrorists, too!
[01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:48.017]  Now, you want a prediction, that's what's going to happen.
[01:38:48.037 --> 01:38:48.358]  Go ahead.
[01:38:49.324 --> 01:39:02.253]  Yeah, it's so shocking how this would happen, because just recently on TV... Look, the Army says in 2000, January 1st, 2000, they said, it says basically, these fools are trendy idiots.
[01:39:02.794 --> 01:39:10.960]  They'll all accept not just chips under their skin, but using Hollywood and using trendiness and style, they'll take them in their brains.
[01:39:11.981 --> 01:39:16.004]  That's absolutely horrible, and I hope there's some way we can really... That's in my book, by the way, the actual Army documents.
[01:39:16.713 --> 01:39:17.634]  Oh, geez.
[01:39:17.914 --> 01:39:27.821]  Okay, the last thing is that I already saw on TV the IBM is already advertising the biometrics where you can actually just thumb scan on to your computer.
[01:39:28.061 --> 01:39:35.806]  And I'm actually shocked because at first I thought InfoWars.com, no offense, was kind of a paranoid joke, but I'm seeing this stuff and it's like I can't stop watching it.
[01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:37.648]  It's like I have to know the information.
[01:39:37.888 --> 01:39:40.229]  No, it is a paranoid joke, really.
[01:39:40.349 --> 01:39:42.611]  Everything's okay.
[01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:43.452]  Are you kidding or just...
[01:39:45.202 --> 01:39:45.842]  You know something?
[01:39:47.284 --> 01:39:50.105]  Eric, it doesn't matter, and I appreciate your call.
[01:39:50.126 --> 01:39:50.506]  Take care.
[01:39:51.547 --> 01:39:53.748]  Sir, it doesn't matter who you think I am.
[01:39:55.049 --> 01:39:55.749]  Open the window.
[01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:56.590]  Stick your head out.
[01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:57.191]  Look around.
[01:39:58.171 --> 01:39:58.992]  Drive down the street.
[01:39:59.312 --> 01:39:59.852]  Look around.
[01:40:00.953 --> 01:40:02.074]  None of this is our opinion.
[01:40:03.855 --> 01:40:05.156]  And I'm glad you're waking up.
[01:40:05.476 --> 01:40:06.997]  And no, that's a joke, sir.
[01:40:07.638 --> 01:40:09.359]  This isn't a paranoid joke.
[01:40:13.002 --> 01:40:13.262]  But my...
[01:40:13.959 --> 01:40:18.542]  What I'm trying to tell you is, you don't need to verify it through me.
[01:40:20.202 --> 01:40:21.583]  I'm not the person to look to.
[01:40:23.364 --> 01:40:25.085]  And I guess that's what happened organically.
[01:40:25.165 --> 01:40:32.469]  I mean, you thought it was a joke, you thought we were just being stupid, you thought it wasn't real, and then you turn the news on every night and you see it.
[01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:36.611]  That's because we're far down the rat hole now.
[01:40:37.652 --> 01:40:39.673]  Ten years ago, you didn't see this on the news.
[01:40:40.407 --> 01:40:42.047]  I was reading it in the government documents.
[01:40:42.087 --> 01:40:47.729]  They had to have plans, blueprints, and it had to be public in a certain strata.
[01:40:48.889 --> 01:40:52.550]  You know, 99.9% of people looked more than that.
[01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:58.632]  I mean, a very infinitesimal amount of people.
[01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:00.432]  I mean, that's what I do.
[01:41:00.452 --> 01:41:02.212]  I don't just get up here and rant and rave on the radio.
[01:41:05.013 --> 01:41:08.054]  Many times a week, I'll get home from working at midnight,
[01:41:09.324 --> 01:41:14.027]  And I'll get in front of the computer, you know, with a pizza or something.
[01:41:14.047 --> 01:41:15.828]  I try not to do that these days, trying to lose weight.
[01:41:16.808 --> 01:41:21.891]  And I'll sit there, you know, with a gallon of ice water and spend three or four hours.
[01:41:21.931 --> 01:41:27.694]  It might be 4 a.m., and I'm just reading government documents, which are all available.
[01:41:28.855 --> 01:41:30.696]  And they call you slaves.
[01:41:30.736 --> 01:41:32.297]  They call you the imperial slaves.
[01:41:32.397 --> 01:41:34.137]  I mean, they actually call us imperial slaves.
[01:41:34.158 --> 01:41:34.418]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:41:39.534 --> 01:41:42.316]  And documents from the 70s and the late 90s.
[01:41:43.357 --> 01:41:43.977]  Top people.
[01:41:44.077 --> 01:41:46.859]  Government certified stuff.
[01:41:47.259 --> 01:41:49.481]  Because they have to communicate with themselves.
[01:41:49.561 --> 01:41:53.183]  And they know that you're not tuned into that strata of information.
[01:41:54.584 --> 01:41:58.487]  You're tuned into Desperate Housewives and tuned into NASCAR.
[01:41:58.947 --> 01:42:01.349]  And so they're just going, hey, the slaves aren't going to figure it out.
[01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:04.331]  We're going to one-child policy them.
[01:42:05.428 --> 01:42:08.169]  We're going to have bio-releases and kill most of them.
[01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:10.310]  We're going to put chips in them.
[01:42:10.671 --> 01:42:11.711]  We're going to force-drug them.
[01:42:12.852 --> 01:42:18.414]  We're going to go in and slaughter and take over all these third world countries, over 100 of them.
[01:42:18.434 --> 01:42:19.295]  63 on Bush's list.
[01:42:21.376 --> 01:42:23.597]  And we're going to do it all through terrorism.
[01:42:25.838 --> 01:42:28.379]  We're going to carry out terror attacks and kill these idiots.
[01:42:29.159 --> 01:42:30.320]  And they're going to come to us for help.
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:32.641]  And we're going to publish this.
[01:42:34.255 --> 01:42:35.795]  And these fools aren't even going to read it.
[01:42:36.155 --> 01:42:41.436]  And if they hear an Alex Jones talk about it, well, they're not going to believe him either, and they're not going to check it out.
[01:42:42.736 --> 01:42:50.518]  So if you want to think it's a sick joke, you just go ahead and sit there and suck your thumb and just go with God.
[01:42:50.798 --> 01:42:51.678]  That's all I can tell you.
[01:42:54.198 --> 01:42:57.479]  And they've got so many sick people working for them to just get off on all this.
[01:42:59.759 --> 01:43:00.860]  And they enjoy it.
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:02.940]  And our children have no future.
[01:43:03.956 --> 01:43:05.177]  This country has no future.
[01:43:05.197 --> 01:43:06.718]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:43:07.958 --> 01:43:14.042]  People are going to get more and more evil and become more and more like their masters as they mass warp our minds with television.
[01:43:15.703 --> 01:43:20.566]  But at the same time, there's going to be a larger group every day that is against all this.
[01:43:22.527 --> 01:43:29.931]  We'll sit there as literally these dumbed-down, slobbering idiots in black uniforms serve this beast system.
[01:43:31.878 --> 01:43:33.279]  And the system will fall apart.
[01:43:33.299 --> 01:43:41.283]  It will fail, but in its collapse, it will kill millions, perhaps billions.
[01:43:44.164 --> 01:43:48.766]  And then out of the fragments of its system, new evil will rise.
[01:43:48.786 --> 01:43:49.707]  That's the way it works.
[01:43:52.308 --> 01:43:55.249]  The fragments of it will reconvene.
[01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:58.611]  Good is never really organized.
[01:43:58.631 --> 01:43:59.331]  That's the problem.
[01:43:59.431 --> 01:43:59.992]  Evil is.
[01:44:00.412 --> 01:44:00.812]  Evil is.
[01:44:03.011 --> 01:44:03.811]  No, sir.
[01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.273]  What we talk about is real here, Eric.
[01:44:08.014 --> 01:44:12.116]  And I know that you don't want to believe that.
[01:44:12.136 --> 01:44:12.977]  You didn't want to believe that.
[01:44:12.997 --> 01:44:14.878]  I'm glad you're being faced now with it.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:25.605]  I'm sorry that we haven't done more, that all of us haven't done more to save this country.
[01:44:26.546 --> 01:44:28.387]  We've got hard times ahead, and I can see it.
[01:44:29.874 --> 01:44:31.415]  Let's talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[01:44:31.435 --> 01:44:32.255]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[01:44:32.655 --> 01:44:39.298]  Brother Alex, I just feel from my heart that you are my brother and you know how you changed my life.
[01:44:40.238 --> 01:44:47.901]  I also want you to check, please see if you got my letter of encouragement and my check and my books because I do want your video.
[01:44:48.621 --> 01:44:50.942]  I want to talk about it on air once I get it.
[01:44:51.482 --> 01:44:52.783]  I want to tell you something.
[01:44:52.903 --> 01:44:55.744]  I used to be very driven more in a bad way.
[01:44:56.324 --> 01:45:01.187]  Until a few years ago when I completely submitted my life to Jesus Christ.
[01:45:01.507 --> 01:45:04.789]  And that's when he opened all these doors to the book and the broadcasting.
[01:45:05.369 --> 01:45:06.970]  And I think that you're tired.
[01:45:07.371 --> 01:45:09.912]  And I want you to think about this very carefully.
[01:45:10.272 --> 01:45:15.155]  Someone told me, I was pretty burned out about four weeks ago, he says, you've got to have joy in your life.
[01:45:15.555 --> 01:45:17.877]  And I got a complete break from the New World Order.
[01:45:18.257 --> 01:45:30.368]  I read magazines, I went out, I did yard work for a few days, and I think it would be a good idea sometimes, if you just consider this, that on Fridays, you would put some of your very best interviews, and you take the day off.
[01:45:30.448 --> 01:45:32.049]  No, I can't do that.
[01:45:32.069 --> 01:45:33.571]  Ma'am, I should never even have...
[01:45:34.111 --> 01:45:38.093]  Mention the fact that I was frustrated and get tired sometimes.
[01:45:38.734 --> 01:45:41.615]  I can't drive down the road without seeing cameras everywhere.
[01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:42.516]  I know.
[01:45:42.796 --> 01:45:43.937]  I don't care.
[01:45:44.937 --> 01:45:51.581]  The police in their black uniforms, the toll roads going in, all of it.
[01:45:52.621 --> 01:45:55.743]  Magazines are full of propaganda everywhere.
[01:45:55.783 --> 01:45:58.605]  The only place I can get away from it is in the woods or in the...
[01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:01.750]  You know, in the fields or in the canyons.
[01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:04.215]  In a book you could read and you could read the Bible.
[01:46:04.535 --> 01:46:05.978]  And I intend to do more of that.
[01:46:06.279 --> 01:46:08.523]  I'm not going to get away from the New World Order and the Bible.
[01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.744]  All it does is expose the New World Order.
[01:46:11.804 --> 01:46:18.328]  But you will receive the spiritual help that you need because there is someone bigger than we are.
[01:46:18.789 --> 01:46:24.472]  I saw it with miracles at the time of my father's death, and I know that he's watching over it.
[01:46:25.012 --> 01:46:26.874]  No, ma'am, I understand that.
[01:46:26.914 --> 01:46:28.455]  What I'm telling you is that...
[01:46:29.535 --> 01:46:32.377]  Is that I just get frustrated because... But you know what, Alex?
[01:46:32.677 --> 01:46:38.500]  You need to get eight hours of sleep or you're going to age too quickly and you won't be as effective with your audience.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.761]  You need to sleep and you need better food.
[01:46:40.841 --> 01:46:42.482]  Lots and lots of raw vegetables.
[01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:44.063]  And I really... No, I hear you.
[01:46:44.103 --> 01:46:44.964]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:46:45.244 --> 01:46:49.086]  But I just got to change the subject earlier, folks.
[01:46:49.446 --> 01:46:57.991]  You know, earlier I mentioned that... I mentioned that I get frustrated, I get tired sometimes...
[01:46:59.193 --> 01:47:09.715]  And I was just sharing with you some of my views, some of my feelings, really just because I speak from the heart on this broadcast, and so that's what I felt like saying, so I said it.
[01:47:10.635 --> 01:47:11.896]  I mean, everybody gets tired.
[01:47:12.156 --> 01:47:15.416]  I mean, I have more energy than most people.
[01:47:15.957 --> 01:47:19.197]  So I really don't think it moves us anywhere.
[01:47:20.237 --> 01:47:21.278]  And I appreciate your encouragement.
[01:47:21.298 --> 01:47:21.858]  Thank you, Elizabeth.
[01:47:23.158 --> 01:47:27.639]  I just don't want to spend any more time talking about Alex Jones because that's really a boring subject.
[01:47:28.388 --> 01:47:31.110]  There's so much news here, so many other calls I wanted to go to.
[01:47:31.631 --> 01:47:32.932]  But thank you for all your encouragement.
[01:47:34.333 --> 01:47:42.719]  I just get frustrated because I cannot properly articulate what the New World Order is up to in many cases.
[01:47:42.739 --> 01:47:48.844]  You know, the full ramifications of it, the full spectrum that I see.
[01:47:48.864 --> 01:47:51.946]  And I know many of you see it as well, and it's hard to articulate.
[01:47:51.986 --> 01:47:52.787]  I mean, it's so big.
[01:47:54.286 --> 01:47:57.687]  And I'm frustrated that I can't get all the projects done I want to.
[01:47:58.088 --> 01:47:59.628]  But that's how creative people are.
[01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:03.530]  And so, you know, that's the bottom line.
[01:48:04.170 --> 01:48:05.971]  But thank you so much, Elizabeth, for your kind words.
[01:48:06.591 --> 01:48:07.311]  Tim in Ohio.
[01:48:07.331 --> 01:48:07.871]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:48:08.051 --> 01:48:08.631]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:48:08.872 --> 01:48:09.232]  Hey, buddy.
[01:48:09.632 --> 01:48:20.736]  Just got word last week that here at my job at a community college we will be getting, drumroll please, ID cards with campus-wide locator chips.
[01:48:22.088 --> 01:48:29.113]  All part of the incrementalization technique of getting us used to, you know, like you say, accepting the chips.
[01:48:29.373 --> 01:48:30.154]  I know, I know.
[01:48:30.214 --> 01:48:34.857]  See, I mean, it's not Alex Jones squeaking on the radio ten years ago now.
[01:48:34.937 --> 01:48:36.538]  I mean, it's happening everywhere.
[01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:44.123]  What have people done in the past, or what can I and we do as a campus community to try to nip this in the bud and put an end to it?
[01:48:44.163 --> 01:48:45.764]  Do you have any advice for us?
[01:48:45.925 --> 01:48:47.305]  So it's students and staff?
[01:48:47.586 --> 01:48:47.886]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:49:06.652]  Well, I mean, I would use the example of, oh, what's the town in California where they try to make all the students wear RFID around their necks, and then the people refused, the school said we're going to do it, then 20 refused and 50, then lawsuits were threatened and they dropped it.
[01:49:08.233 --> 01:49:16.518]  And I would just type in school drops RFID plan, and you'll get the article, and I'd print up about 100 copies of that,
[01:49:17.196 --> 01:49:20.897]  With your own little comment and press release at the top saying, resist this, say no.
[01:49:21.657 --> 01:49:27.219]  And I'd march around and resist it and get people to say no to it.
[01:49:28.599 --> 01:49:30.280]  It violates your privacy.
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:31.440]  It treats you like a prisoner.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.581]  It's antagonists like animals.
[01:49:34.121 --> 01:49:37.062]  Yeah, I mean, this is Nazi Germany, and they'll drop it.
[01:49:37.362 --> 01:49:38.182]  I'll not stand for it.
[01:49:38.902 --> 01:49:40.302]  You've got to fight it, though.
[01:49:40.603 --> 01:49:42.243]  And at first they're going to say they're not going to stop it.
[01:49:42.999 --> 01:49:45.962]  Criminals and bullies always say there's nothing you can do.
[01:49:46.462 --> 01:49:47.143]  Oh yeah, there is.
[01:49:47.383 --> 01:49:49.826]  I'm going to knock you upside the head with the truth.
[01:49:50.286 --> 01:49:50.866]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:49:50.887 --> 01:49:51.467]  I'll be back.
[01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:57.593]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.773 --> 01:50:02.217]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.337 --> 01:50:03.158]  There is a chance.
[01:50:04.628 --> 01:50:06.709]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:50:06.789 --> 01:50:09.832]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:50:09.872 --> 01:50:14.094]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.154 --> 01:50:21.099]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.219 --> 01:50:23.301]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.461 --> 01:50:33.928]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.588 --> 01:50:34.808]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:53:01.936 --> 01:53:06.618]  You know, my friends, we don't have a choice.
[01:53:06.698 --> 01:53:09.820]  Either we will control the world we live in, or we will be enslaved.
[01:53:11.961 --> 01:53:29.769]  This futurist, Wolfgang Gollum, or Groke, this IBM executive, says 20 years from now, we, the older generations, will still hate it, implantable microchips, but kids will never know a world without it.
[01:53:30.552 --> 01:53:43.440]  The arrival of the hip, young microchippers is only the start of radical, industry-changing trends that Mr. Grokey says big companies are struggling to address because of the reluctance for radical innovation.
[01:53:44.021 --> 01:53:46.642]  Now look, it's IBM and the globalists that are pushing the chips.
[01:53:46.743 --> 01:53:47.603]  No one wants it.
[01:53:48.864 --> 01:53:50.905]  Only government and media is pushing it.
[01:53:51.365 --> 01:53:54.548]  I said they'd pose it as radical and trendy and stylish.
[01:53:55.408 --> 01:53:58.210]  And I've got articles I wrote six years ago where I say that.
[01:53:58.914 --> 01:54:03.737]  Films I made three years ago where I said they're going to sell it as trendy and cool, because I know how they operate.
[01:54:05.218 --> 01:54:10.262]  And yeah, they'll show people on TV that the guy that has the chips gets the really hot girl.
[01:54:11.403 --> 01:54:19.408]  And so he'll run out and get chips, and when the girls see that he has the chips, because they're trendies, they'll think, my goodness, he's got chips, I better go out with him.
[01:54:21.369 --> 01:54:23.851]  But it's still going to be hard for him to do it.
[01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:32.818]  The big thing they're going to do on top of this is carry out terrorist attacks and blame it on a right-wing Christian group that's against chips.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.642]  And then people will run out to get the chips to prove they're good citizens.
[01:54:38.162 --> 01:54:45.248]  As Andy Rooney on 60 Minutes said, that was almost four years ago, he said, everybody needs a chip to prove they're a good person.
[01:54:45.328 --> 01:54:46.029]  He actually said it.
[01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:51.754]  And again, you do polls, 98% of people are against this, but the mainstream media...
[01:54:53.337 --> 01:54:55.458]  Keeps repeating it like it's normal and cool.
[01:54:55.998 --> 01:54:58.960]  Until finally I see these articles now and I've been conditioned.
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:00.801]  I don't even hardly talk about it anymore.
[01:55:00.821 --> 01:55:02.062]  It's just, yeah, there they are.
[01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:04.463]  Yeah, they're saying we're going to have to have chips.
[01:55:06.724 --> 01:55:10.326]  He says that in ten years, millions will have the chips.
[01:55:10.866 --> 01:55:17.570]  The process is still cumbersome, he says, but by willing a cursor around a keyboard on a computer screen with their mind...
[01:55:18.607 --> 01:55:19.808]  They can write and send email.
[01:55:19.888 --> 01:55:23.612]  It's really the start of interfacing the chip with the nervous system, he said.
[01:55:25.794 --> 01:55:35.622]  And he went on again to say that the chip in the arm produced by Verichip Corporation, within a decade, he says, microchips will be common.
[01:55:36.103 --> 01:55:43.990]  Already two scientists at Britain's Warwick University have chips embedded under their skin that let them send emails just by thinking.
[01:55:46.289 --> 01:55:50.371]  And of course, they force hundreds of thousands of people onto drugs each year in this country.
[01:55:50.412 --> 01:55:54.554]  Now they've got a chip that hooks into a nerve into the brain that makes you feel better.
[01:55:54.574 --> 01:55:57.716]  And they're already talking about making people take that chip.
[01:55:59.657 --> 01:56:01.438]  So you'll feel much better.
[01:56:01.458 --> 01:56:02.999]  You're about to get your chip now.
[01:56:03.499 --> 01:56:05.821]  You'll be with us soon, don't worry.
[01:56:06.301 --> 01:56:09.042]  See, now you don't believe in that bad New World Order.
[01:56:09.663 --> 01:56:13.105]  Now, if you just go along with us, there'll be unlimited pleasure.
[01:56:13.857 --> 01:56:15.978]  Deliver directly to your mind.
[01:56:16.538 --> 01:56:17.598]  Oh, yes.
[01:56:18.018 --> 01:56:18.198]  Oh.
[01:56:18.658 --> 01:56:20.139]  Now, who makes you feel good?
[01:56:20.379 --> 01:56:22.540]  New World Order does.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:27.221]  You're not with those terrorists that keep attacking, are you?
[01:56:28.161 --> 01:56:32.583]  We've got to arrest anyone who's against chipping because that's what the terrorists are for.
[01:56:34.543 --> 01:56:36.084]  IBM loves you.
[01:56:36.644 --> 01:56:42.906]  Before we end this hour, just briefly, the new film, Martial Law, 9-11 rise of the police state that does get into the chipping.
[01:56:44.017 --> 01:56:48.299]  And 9-11 and the police state, obviously, and the occult elite that runs it all.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:50.281]  The order of death.
[01:56:50.581 --> 01:56:52.042]  They bring us death, my friends.
[01:56:52.602 --> 01:56:53.502]  Expose them now.
[01:56:53.542 --> 01:57:01.207]  Go to Infowars.com to get the new film or any of the other great films.
[01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:02.767]  Please go to Infowars.com.
[01:57:02.787 --> 01:57:04.929]  Peruse the safe, secure shopping cart and get the video.
[01:57:05.369 --> 01:57:06.089]  Make copies of it.
[01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.770]  Get it out to people.
[01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:07.470]  It needs to be seen.
[01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:08.291]  It's having an effect.
[01:57:08.991 --> 01:57:09.771]  We don't have a choice.
[01:57:09.811 --> 01:57:10.692]  We must resist.
[01:57:10.752 --> 01:57:12.593]  And resisting does make things better for everybody.
[01:57:13.251 --> 01:57:13.671]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:13.691 --> 01:57:15.432]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:15.452 --> 01:57:28.535]  Or you can go to prisonplanet.tv and watch the new film right now.
[01:57:29.315 --> 01:57:30.575]  Or watch all the films right now.
[01:57:31.896 --> 01:57:36.977]  And the predominant amount of your funds that come in goes to fight the New World Order.
[01:57:37.017 --> 01:57:37.837]  You can be assured of that.
[01:57:38.717 --> 01:57:40.598]  Third hour, your call is a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:57:40.618 --> 01:57:41.018]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.192 --> 01:57:50.075]  Introduce... Big Brother.
[01:57:50.715 --> 01:57:51.796]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.496 --> 01:57:53.596]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.237 --> 01:57:55.077]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.817 --> 01:57:57.738]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.758 --> 01:58:01.359]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.559 --> 01:58:05.661]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.911 --> 01:58:20.234]  Welcome, my friends, now into the third hour of this live Wednesday edition.
[01:58:21.835 --> 01:58:22.975]  The 20th day.
[01:58:25.597 --> 01:58:27.338]  The 20th day, my friends.
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.481]  Of April 2005.
[01:58:33.902 --> 01:58:38.805]  And in the last hour, we were talking about Wolfgang Gruckel, or Grucke, or Gollum.
[01:58:40.211 --> 01:58:47.054]  Chairman and founder of Future World, former IBM executive, he says we're all going to be getting our microchips very, very soon because we're trendy and cool.
[01:58:49.054 --> 01:58:57.398]  Of course, long before Verichip started jumping around promoting it, I was reading globalist documents saying that's exactly how they pushed this whole agenda.
[01:58:57.698 --> 01:59:04.500]  The brother of the new pope of Ratzinger is saying that he thinks it's a bad idea.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.741]  We'll tell you why.
[01:59:07.075 --> 01:59:09.176]  We've got some interesting economic news as well.
[01:59:09.216 --> 01:59:11.318]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:59:11.358 --> 01:59:13.159]  Let's talk to Brian in Virginia.
[01:59:13.219 --> 01:59:13.959]  Brian, welcome.
[01:59:14.519 --> 01:59:15.060]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:22.784]  I was going to mention, I recently, of course, got out of the Navy over the summer, and I'd received a letter that was mailed out November 8th from the U.S.
[01:59:22.824 --> 01:59:28.568]  Navy ordering me to, of course, muster my phone and update the website with all our information.
[01:59:29.608 --> 01:59:31.129]  So I called New Orleans.
[01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:32.710]  They said, well...
[01:59:33.905 --> 01:59:39.087]  We sent out 700,000 of those letters, and of course, if you don't call within 30 days, they're automatically activated.
[01:59:39.107 --> 01:59:39.427]  They won't.
[01:59:39.907 --> 01:59:43.929]  Oh, yeah, they're automatically going to activate you and bring you back to active duty.
[01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:53.173]  Another friend of mine just got another letter, and I received one of those letters, but I didn't get the second one where he has to muster a course in person.
[01:59:53.933 --> 01:59:55.013]  Now, he's in the U.S.
[01:59:55.074 --> 01:59:57.354]  Navy, which is supposed to be scaling down.
[01:59:58.395 --> 02:00:03.037]  Then I got another friend who's in the Reserves, and he just finished exercises out in Vegas with 30,000 other troops
[02:00:05.141 --> 02:00:11.243]  With Mach-Meg aircraft, 0-9 yards, with massive, massive drill.
[02:00:12.343 --> 02:00:20.406]  I think it comes, it's interesting, it comes on the Hill of Articles, of course, about Carl Vinson Roosevelt going out to the Med, and I haven't confirmed that.
[02:00:20.426 --> 02:00:21.886]  I can call the base and find out.
[02:00:23.807 --> 02:00:24.807]  Do you support the Truman?
[02:00:25.767 --> 02:00:29.048]  And to put pressure, of course, on Syria and Iran.
[02:00:29.068 --> 02:00:31.749]  I was curious about any of your thoughts on that.
[02:00:32.395 --> 02:00:33.836]  Well, I think you've got the answers.
[02:00:33.876 --> 02:00:37.277]  I mean, they're gearing up for an expansion in war.
[02:00:38.638 --> 02:00:52.905]  They have sent more aircraft carriers into the Mediterranean, and they are gearing up, and they can't even continue in Iraq at current levels, and they're setting back up the draft boards.
[02:00:52.945 --> 02:01:00.008]  They've just passed a law in Oregon to make you, when you get your driver's license, automatically set you up for the draft.
[02:01:00.919 --> 02:01:02.260]  I mean, this is going on everywhere.
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.260]  They're gearing up for it.
[02:01:04.161 --> 02:01:05.261]  Well, they definitely see that.
[02:01:05.281 --> 02:01:08.163]  I'm sorry they didn't have a question, of course, about the IBM's new chip.
[02:01:09.403 --> 02:01:11.584]  No, listen, it can be any subject you want to mention.
[02:01:11.605 --> 02:01:15.226]  I understand they're coming out with a new, what I call the new tabulating machine.
[02:01:16.647 --> 02:01:18.628]  They used, of course, in Nazi Germany.
[02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:23.511]  I just see it as one of the most heinous things that can happen to the human race.
[02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:29.934]  We were brought up that if you had to show your papers, if you were tracked and traced, you were a slave.
[02:01:30.572 --> 02:01:34.336]  If the government forcibly, psychologically tested you, you were in Soviet Russia.
[02:01:35.397 --> 02:01:37.860]  That if there were cameras up on the street corners, it was 1984.
[02:01:39.101 --> 02:01:45.027]  And now they just go, no, Big Brother's good, and you better accept it, because that's the way it is.
[02:01:45.908 --> 02:01:46.529]  Exactly.
[02:01:46.549 --> 02:01:47.870]  Exactly.
[02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:52.075]  But now it's the end thing to do, I suppose, or they're going to try to sell it as such.
[02:01:53.110 --> 02:02:10.054]  Well, I mean, it's all wildly unpopular, but again, that tiny minority that runs the media continues to act like it's popular and normal, and then we as individuals, even though we're the majority, feel like we're alone, and then the trendies out there just do whatever's trendy.
[02:02:10.735 --> 02:02:11.135]  Exactly.
[02:02:11.235 --> 02:02:16.476]  And they could tell them, go to the store, buy a revolver, blow your head off, and they would all do it.
[02:02:17.325 --> 02:02:18.506]  Oh, wow, that's trendy here.
[02:02:18.586 --> 02:02:18.966]  Boom!
[02:02:18.986 --> 02:02:21.548]  You know, I would be with Al-Qaeda if I didn't do this.
[02:02:21.568 --> 02:02:25.051]  I mean, there are people that if the media told them to go jump off a cliff, they'd do it.
[02:02:25.931 --> 02:02:26.572]  Oh, I agree.
[02:02:26.812 --> 02:02:27.272]  I agree.
[02:02:27.513 --> 02:02:28.093]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:28.413 --> 02:02:29.174]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:29.214 --> 02:02:29.894]  I appreciate it.
[02:02:31.575 --> 02:02:35.018]  No, we're not telling the yuppies that that's cool, because I know you'd all run out and do it.
[02:02:36.799 --> 02:02:37.840]  It's unbelievable.
[02:02:38.741 --> 02:02:39.761]  Out of sight, out of mind.
[02:02:39.801 --> 02:02:41.623]  They think everything's okay, so it must be.
[02:02:42.083 --> 02:02:42.824]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:42.844 --> 02:02:43.264]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.838 --> 02:02:46.360]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:49.603]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:49.743 --> 02:02:53.647]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:53.687 --> 02:02:57.932]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:58.272 --> 02:03:02.056]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.196 --> 02:03:04.018]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.038 --> 02:03:04.198]  Wow.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:12.243]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.403 --> 02:03:15.444]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:15.624 --> 02:03:18.466]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:18.966 --> 02:03:25.090]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:27.451]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:03:44.824 --> 02:03:47.827]  The Berkey Light is your premier source of purified water.
[02:03:48.188 --> 02:03:57.017]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:57.317 --> 02:04:02.002]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:02.462 --> 02:04:09.186]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:09.586 --> 02:04:21.373]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.853 --> 02:04:26.295]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:26.475 --> 02:04:28.937]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:28.957 --> 02:04:30.777]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:30.797 --> 02:04:32.058]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.078 --> 02:04:33.539]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:33.559 --> 02:04:34.619]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:43.695 --> 02:04:51.658]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:04:52.038 --> 02:04:53.279]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:04:53.539 --> 02:04:54.199]  Now, check this out.
[02:04:54.559 --> 02:04:57.981]  The average American consumes two to three pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:04:58.301 --> 02:04:58.901]  That's about 150 pounds.
[02:04:59.121 --> 02:04:59.682]  We're good to go.
[02:05:18.642 --> 02:05:22.766]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[02:05:23.086 --> 02:05:25.108]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[02:05:25.128 --> 02:05:26.509]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:05:26.529 --> 02:05:28.250]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:05:28.631 --> 02:05:29.411]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[02:05:49.445 --> 02:05:50.086]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.766 --> 02:05:51.826]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.526 --> 02:05:53.627]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.287 --> 02:05:55.127]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.867 --> 02:05:56.748]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.768 --> 02:06:01.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.609 --> 02:06:05.750]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.770 --> 02:06:10.532]  All right, let's start blasting through your calls in rapid succession.
[02:06:12.252 --> 02:06:14.833]  And then we'll jump right back in to the news.
[02:06:16.337 --> 02:06:19.740]  More and more talk of a national draft, as the last caller just mentioned.
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:24.824]  He just got out of the Navy, and they're already preparing to call him back up, and everybody else he knows.
[02:06:25.624 --> 02:06:26.665]  Very, very serious.
[02:06:26.885 --> 02:06:28.947]  They are talking about striking Iran.
[02:06:29.508 --> 02:06:34.912]  Right now, let's talk to, I guess, up next here is Larry in Ohio.
[02:06:34.952 --> 02:06:35.753]  Larry, go ahead.
[02:06:36.453 --> 02:06:37.574]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:06:37.614 --> 02:06:37.994]  Good, sir.
[02:06:38.455 --> 02:06:39.175]  Hey, it's really good.
[02:06:39.255 --> 02:06:41.217]  I really got turned on to your show, and I love it.
[02:06:41.237 --> 02:06:43.739]  I'm off with a sprained ankle, and I'm listening to you every day.
[02:06:44.532 --> 02:06:51.075]  The reason I'm calling, that last caller you had from Ohio, not the last one, Tim, about the cards with the chips in them?
[02:06:51.555 --> 02:06:57.277]  Yeah, he's been told all the staff and all the students have to have tracker chip cards.
[02:06:57.457 --> 02:06:57.977]  Go ahead.
[02:06:58.458 --> 02:07:03.840]  Well, anyway, I never cared too much for the American Civil Liberties Union, but I've been reading a lot about them.
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:05.720]  That's where he should go if he's listening.
[02:07:06.221 --> 02:07:08.521]  Check them out, and they will at least do something about it.
[02:07:09.062 --> 02:07:12.003]  But the real reason I called is, are you familiar with...
[02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:16.394]  H-A-A-R-P, HAARP?
[02:07:16.434 --> 02:07:19.437]  Yes, we had a guest on, Dr. Nick Begich, last week about that.
[02:07:19.677 --> 02:07:20.097]  Oh, you did?
[02:07:20.137 --> 02:07:30.928]  Because, like I said, I just recently started listening, and I'm reading through a book that was by Dr. Nick Begich, and this thing can control your brain and everything.
[02:07:30.968 --> 02:07:33.711]  He told me, I talked to him on the phone just this past week,
[02:07:34.397 --> 02:07:36.758]  They're getting ready to fire it up in a few months again.
[02:07:37.038 --> 02:07:38.299]  The one up there in Alaska?
[02:07:38.339 --> 02:07:39.959]  Well, they've quadrupled the power.
[02:07:40.259 --> 02:07:40.860]  Yeah.
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:41.460]  Did they?
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:42.060]  Did they?
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:42.600]  I wasn't aware.
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.781]  Well, he's got all the patents.
[02:07:43.881 --> 02:07:44.781]  I mean, it's real.
[02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:47.362]  Well, this thing can do all kinds of stuff.
[02:07:47.402 --> 02:07:56.786]  It can control the weather and control your brain and spot submarines and excavations and holes and stuff underground and oil.
[02:07:57.146 --> 02:07:59.547]  I mean, this thing is pretty scary if it can control your brain.
[02:07:59.567 --> 02:08:00.688]  That's what I'm worried about.
[02:08:00.928 --> 02:08:03.449]  Well, I mean, it doesn't control you like a remote control, but it...
[02:08:04.930 --> 02:08:05.851]  They've done the studies.
[02:08:06.071 --> 02:08:10.333]  These targeted different wavelengths can make you sick, can make you euphoric.
[02:08:10.993 --> 02:08:14.935]  And DARPA was in, what, last year.
[02:08:14.955 --> 02:08:16.335]  It was unbelievable.
[02:08:16.375 --> 02:08:24.439]  They were in the Boston Globe saying they're going to move into mind-control towers in America just to make sure, in case there's an attack, they can make us all be calm.
[02:08:24.479 --> 02:08:28.641]  And they're just putting it in major papers now that they'll be controlling us, but it's part of freedom.
[02:08:28.661 --> 02:08:30.722]  And once they flip them on, you'll feel much better.
[02:08:31.934 --> 02:08:32.294]  I won't.
[02:08:33.556 --> 02:08:34.697]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:08:35.077 --> 02:08:36.098]  Oh, no, I know you're not.
[02:08:36.238 --> 02:08:38.200]  Well, I feel like I am.
[02:08:38.241 --> 02:08:40.323]  I mean, I can't believe it's gotten this insane, people.
[02:08:40.903 --> 02:08:43.606]  Well, you have to laugh just to keep your sanity.
[02:08:44.087 --> 02:08:46.169]  I mean, my wife thinks I'm nuts.
[02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:48.111]  When I sprained my ankle, I came upstairs and laughed.
[02:08:48.611 --> 02:08:51.614]  It hurt so bad, I laughed because I said it would keep me from crying.
[02:08:51.874 --> 02:08:54.277]  But you have to laugh at this stuff because it's so stupid.
[02:08:54.898 --> 02:08:56.579]  I mean, it's scary, but it's stupid.
[02:08:57.019 --> 02:08:59.061]  Or we'll go nuts, like that one caller told you.
[02:08:59.101 --> 02:08:59.941]  You've got to take a break.
[02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:01.442]  Well, actually, that's pretty normal.
[02:09:01.482 --> 02:09:02.143]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:02.203 --> 02:09:02.743]  Good points.
[02:09:03.764 --> 02:09:07.606]  I've been walking around at night and run into the dining room table and, ah!
[02:09:08.087 --> 02:09:10.388]  You know, it's totally painful on your knee or shin.
[02:09:10.428 --> 02:09:15.131]  And then after about a minute of excruciating pain, endorphins kick in and you kind of laugh.
[02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:16.412]  Oh, man, that hurt.
[02:09:16.732 --> 02:09:17.553]  Man, I'm an idiot.
[02:09:18.333 --> 02:09:19.394]  That's actually pretty normal.
[02:09:21.334 --> 02:09:22.775]  One time I broke my leg real bad.
[02:09:22.795 --> 02:09:24.176]  It was almost a compound fracture.
[02:09:24.376 --> 02:09:25.738]  The bone was almost sticking out of my leg.
[02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:30.922]  After a few minutes of excruciating pain, it was kind of euphoric.
[02:09:30.942 --> 02:09:33.884]  Your body injects you basically with your own heroin.
[02:09:35.345 --> 02:09:36.326]  That's what endorphins are.
[02:09:38.207 --> 02:09:39.528]  Very similar.
[02:09:39.568 --> 02:09:41.990]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:09:43.251 --> 02:09:44.973]  Then they wear off and you're in a lot more pain.
[02:09:46.105 --> 02:09:50.067]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carol in Pennsylvania.
[02:09:50.087 --> 02:09:50.387]  Welcome.
[02:09:50.727 --> 02:09:51.087]  Welcome.
[02:09:51.748 --> 02:09:53.589]  Alex and I have three things I've got to tell you.
[02:09:53.789 --> 02:09:55.189]  One, they do have a Zapper.
[02:09:55.249 --> 02:09:59.771]  It's called GoToTagZapper.com to do the RFID tips.
[02:09:59.851 --> 02:10:00.932]  It will locate and...
[02:10:02.951 --> 02:10:06.133]  I also bought a clicker that turns any TV off.
[02:10:06.173 --> 02:10:07.654]  Those clickers are fun.
[02:10:07.694 --> 02:10:08.354]  Go in restaurants.
[02:10:08.394 --> 02:10:11.056]  Okay, this isn't on the market yet, but it's about ready to come out.
[02:10:11.076 --> 02:10:12.297]  I saw the article, yeah.
[02:10:12.537 --> 02:10:18.621]  Yeah, okay, and Bush is going to Holland next month, and people want him arrested when his feet hit the soil.
[02:10:19.281 --> 02:10:29.928]  Now, that last gentleman that called about HAARP, I never heard a mention on Genesis about the microwave bomb that our government set off over the state of Washington about four weeks ago.
[02:10:30.785 --> 02:10:34.068]  And it caused an earthquake 3.5 some distance from there.
[02:10:35.048 --> 02:10:39.051]  They told the people with the meteorite to change the jet stream.
[02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:40.953]  Well, Condoleezza Rice went to Russia.
[02:10:40.973 --> 02:10:45.316]  I know there was an earthquake up there, but it was actually on your news?
[02:10:45.897 --> 02:10:48.599]  No, I read this where they set off a microwave bomb.
[02:10:48.639 --> 02:10:54.303]  Well, Condoleezza went to Russia, and the idea they said... Carol, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:10:54.323 --> 02:10:58.947]  I mean, look, I just said that DARPA says they're going to put up mine control towers.
[02:10:59.447 --> 02:11:00.588]  Now, they really said that.
[02:11:01.748 --> 02:11:02.908]  I can show you where they said it.
[02:11:03.588 --> 02:11:09.369]  But then there's other people out there who just go on the Internet and they say a microwave bomb went off.
[02:11:09.409 --> 02:11:13.090]  I don't just come right out and believe that.
[02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:23.712]  Okay, Russia sent a letter to our government telling them it's probably time to invade America because of them changing the jet stream.
[02:11:24.732 --> 02:11:29.493]  I sent the article to somebody else and I never heard it on Genesis, so I can send you the article.
[02:11:30.103 --> 02:11:31.423]  Okay, what was the article out of?
[02:11:31.763 --> 02:11:32.944]  I don't remember offhand.
[02:11:32.984 --> 02:11:33.944]  I'm not at my computer.
[02:11:34.484 --> 02:11:37.765]  Well, I know they have an EMP bomb.
[02:11:38.765 --> 02:11:39.406]  It must have been.
[02:11:39.666 --> 02:11:41.066]  They called it a microwave bomb.
[02:11:41.086 --> 02:11:50.449]  Now, Russia warned us two years ago about HAARP, and they said it has to be stopped because it's going to cause a catastrophic worldwide event if they do this second part.
[02:11:50.489 --> 02:11:52.689]  Well, Russia's got its own antenna arrays.
[02:11:52.949 --> 02:11:57.611]  Yeah, well, anyway, I was looking at your DSL.
[02:11:59.542 --> 02:12:00.443]  I don't know what to do there.
[02:12:00.483 --> 02:12:02.325]  I don't know if I could get it, but I would like to.
[02:12:02.905 --> 02:12:08.331]  Oh, yeah, I'm not the guy that runs all that, but it's really good service at InfoWars.net.
[02:12:08.711 --> 02:12:11.634]  Yeah, I was there last night in the middle of the night.
[02:12:13.055 --> 02:12:16.518]  Well, we do sell Internet service, and it's really good service.
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:22.524]  I have Time Warner Cable modem, but whenever my modem goes down years ago,
[02:12:24.142 --> 02:12:25.462]  I had other internet dial-ups.
[02:12:25.482 --> 02:12:27.343]  Couldn't even hardly get online with them.
[02:12:27.383 --> 02:12:29.063]  Couldn't upload and download my website.
[02:12:29.523 --> 02:12:33.685]  But with the service that we've got, it's really good phone numbers, too.
[02:12:34.065 --> 02:12:34.965]  Just for dial-ups.
[02:12:35.025 --> 02:12:37.506]  It's like hyper-turbo dial-ups.
[02:12:37.566 --> 02:12:40.106]  Not like I could get that here in Pennsylvania if I had it, right?
[02:12:40.706 --> 02:12:42.467]  I guarantee you can get dial-ups.
[02:12:43.107 --> 02:12:44.387]  And you can get DSL from us.
[02:12:44.807 --> 02:12:46.848]  It'll cost a little more because...
[02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:54.894]  The big companies have lowered their prices to stop any competition, but you would be supporting InfoWars.net, yeah.
[02:12:55.194 --> 02:12:55.795]  Yeah, okay.
[02:12:55.815 --> 02:12:59.397]  Well, I guess maybe I'd better go there and type that stuff in and see if I can get it here.
[02:12:59.437 --> 02:13:00.557]  I'm not sure that I can.
[02:13:00.698 --> 02:13:01.098]  Wonderful.
[02:13:01.118 --> 02:13:03.219]  Good to hear from you, and send me info on that.
[02:13:03.279 --> 02:13:08.722]  Okay, because now this is the second time, but they said it was time to invade and occupy America.
[02:13:09.183 --> 02:13:09.683]  All right, well.
[02:13:10.262 --> 02:13:14.686]  Well, I mean, the people controlling America control Russia, but Carol, thank you.
[02:13:14.946 --> 02:13:17.588]  I mean, it is in the cards to have foreign troops here.
[02:13:17.788 --> 02:13:22.272]  They really are conditioning us to accept that, but I don't think they'd call it an invasion.
[02:13:22.312 --> 02:13:30.418]  They've said, quote, if we're involved in an overseas war tied down in foreign engagements, is the quote, that foreign assets would be used to defend the homeland.
[02:13:31.019 --> 02:13:37.564]  And that's been said by the UN, by NORAD generals, by secretaries of defense.
[02:13:37.624 --> 02:13:38.705]  I mean, that is real.
[02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:42.480]  And they really are training cadres of troops for gun confiscations.
[02:13:42.921 --> 02:13:43.941]  That is real.
[02:13:44.442 --> 02:13:46.603]  I have that in triplicate, in quadruplicate.
[02:13:47.143 --> 02:13:49.465]  I mean, I have that just up one side and down the other.
[02:13:50.286 --> 02:13:54.028]  Let's go ahead and take another call after Carol.
[02:13:54.048 --> 02:13:58.511]  Let's talk to Tyler in Washington.
[02:13:58.551 --> 02:13:59.011]  Go ahead.
[02:13:59.031 --> 02:14:00.793]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:14:00.893 --> 02:14:01.153]  Good.
[02:14:02.114 --> 02:14:08.398]  Hey, look, I wanted to let you know that the Minuteman Project is not what you think it is, Alex.
[02:14:08.942 --> 02:14:10.603]  They are planning this.
[02:14:10.803 --> 02:14:16.545]  Why do you think Lou Dobbs is allowed to go on CNN and beat up the borders being opened?
[02:14:17.125 --> 02:14:21.467]  Arnold Schwarzenegger came out and said, we should close the borders so he could be on that side.
[02:14:22.007 --> 02:14:26.009]  Bush is against it so he could be on that side.
[02:14:26.429 --> 02:14:29.890]  But what's going to happen is there's going to be a civil dispute.
[02:14:30.611 --> 02:14:38.694]  These illegal immigrants are going to come up, they're going to get guns on the American side, and they're going to cause a civil dispute
[02:14:39.611 --> 02:14:49.834]  Well, that's been being said for a month before the April 1st Minuteman Project started 20 days ago, and by the grace of God, it hasn't happened yet.
[02:14:50.354 --> 02:14:55.075]  That's going to be the cry that, hey, these guys got guns on the American side.
[02:14:55.115 --> 02:14:57.635]  We've got to get the guns away from the Americans.
[02:14:58.356 --> 02:15:01.576]  That's the whole reason the Russians collapsed.
[02:15:01.736 --> 02:15:02.717]  They didn't collapse.
[02:15:03.097 --> 02:15:04.177]  They wanted to focus.
[02:15:05.039 --> 02:15:10.881]  On the Americans, because we're the only ones that are stopping this New World Order, because we've got the weapons, Alex.
[02:15:11.636 --> 02:15:12.557]  Think about it now.
[02:15:12.797 --> 02:15:14.399]  I want you to consider it at least.
[02:15:14.579 --> 02:15:17.322]  At least bring that, so you're not blindsided.
[02:15:17.342 --> 02:15:18.683]  No, I've already thought about it a lot.
[02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:20.185]  We've discussed this.
[02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:21.226]  Provocateurs.
[02:15:21.806 --> 02:15:24.069]  I mean, you don't think the Minutemen themselves are bad, do you?
[02:15:24.449 --> 02:15:25.330]  No, no, no.
[02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:27.372]  You know, they're good-hearted patriots.
[02:15:27.492 --> 02:15:32.017]  But I'm telling you, they're being backdoor funded by... These guys are smart.
[02:15:32.077 --> 02:15:32.958]  You know they are.
[02:15:33.018 --> 02:15:34.780]  They are, you know, as it is written...
[02:15:35.495 --> 02:15:37.436]  You know, they're wiser than Daniel.
[02:15:37.536 --> 02:15:38.956]  They have more than one asset.
[02:15:39.016 --> 02:15:41.678]  You and I are on the same page with this biochemical.
[02:15:42.078 --> 02:15:46.099]  You know, they want to do it, they're practicing it, but they're testing the waters.
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:48.961]  If that doesn't work, and we're in a crossfire, Alex.
[02:15:49.121 --> 02:15:53.282]  If we don't do anything, they're going to crush our economy by the infiltration.
[02:15:53.763 --> 02:15:59.285]  But the reason that the government themselves are not doing anything is so that, you know, the
[02:15:59.795 --> 02:16:03.678]  The United States citizens will start to say, hey, look, this is enough.
[02:16:03.778 --> 02:16:04.399]  This is enough.
[02:16:04.539 --> 02:16:06.080]  And they want a conflict.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:11.404]  Do you know who John Titan or Triton is, this so-called space traveler?
[02:16:11.444 --> 02:16:12.185]  Have you heard of him?
[02:16:12.665 --> 02:16:13.246]  Oh, gosh.
[02:16:13.586 --> 02:16:14.607]  No, no, listen to me.
[02:16:14.847 --> 02:16:16.208]  This is a new world.
[02:16:16.348 --> 02:16:20.472]  This is one of those War of the Worlds projects, Alex.
[02:16:20.612 --> 02:16:22.093]  They already have this planned.
[02:16:22.594 --> 02:16:28.275]  And they just threw that out there so that when this occurs, people will go, oh, look, there's space travel.
[02:16:28.675 --> 02:16:33.756]  You and I both know there's not space travelers, but it's just like War of the Worlds.
[02:16:34.177 --> 02:16:36.077]  Thank you for the call.
[02:16:37.217 --> 02:16:37.537]  Oh, boy.
[02:16:39.358 --> 02:16:45.079]  Now, you know, people can't believe something when something good happens.
[02:16:46.483 --> 02:16:47.263]  And yes, it's true.
[02:16:47.343 --> 02:16:57.405]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, after being for open borders, because his approval rating has fallen completely down to nothing, is coming back and saying he's for controlling the borders.
[02:16:57.425 --> 02:16:58.985]  He said that yesterday.
[02:16:59.005 --> 02:17:03.406]  I have the article here in front of me, and that's one of the news items I'm going to cover.
[02:17:05.266 --> 02:17:07.887]  But the Minuteman project is an organic project.
[02:17:09.887 --> 02:17:14.348]  They're peacefully, by that I mean grassroots, they're peacefully out there doing a good job.
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:26.729]  The government's very upset about it, and the Mexican government threatened force, the Mexican troops did, the MS-13 gangs did, and it hasn't happened yet.
[02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:32.993]  And I just think they hope it'll peter out and disappear and just go away.
[02:17:34.214 --> 02:17:38.358]  And the government may try to pull something like that later, but it's just not going to work.
[02:17:39.178 --> 02:17:40.939]  The government is not all-powerful.
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:42.821]  The New World Order is not all-powerful.
[02:17:45.163 --> 02:17:51.791]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oregano, Oregomax, and the many under-health products from North American Urban Spice.
[02:17:52.151 --> 02:18:02.203]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, in particular the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[02:18:02.943 --> 02:18:04.425]  With a 100% kill.

[02:18:55.113 --> 02:19:06.337]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:19:06.678 --> 02:19:12.380]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:13.320]  We're good to go.
[02:19:36.834 --> 02:19:37.254]  803-4438.

[02:19:45.763 --> 02:19:46.324]  Hi, folks.
[02:19:46.364 --> 02:19:48.125]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:49.447]  The real money, folks.
[02:19:52.734 --> 02:19:56.135]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:56.215 --> 02:19:58.075]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:19:58.655 --> 02:20:04.057]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:20:13.982 --> 02:20:19.605]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:20.226 --> 02:20:23.267]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:20:23.808 --> 02:20:28.970]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:31.532 --> 02:20:34.193]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[02:20:34.874 --> 02:20:37.815]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[02:20:38.256 --> 02:20:39.656]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.321 --> 02:20:44.781]  We're good to go.
[02:21:03.513 --> 02:21:04.254]  We're good to go.
[02:21:26.977 --> 02:21:27.358]  That's 866-371-2330.
[02:21:27.398 --> 02:21:27.598]  That's 866-371-2330.
[02:21:47.879 --> 02:21:48.319]  Don't worry.
[02:21:48.839 --> 02:21:50.400]  This show is documented.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:53.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:57.561]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:58.001 --> 02:22:02.162]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:22:02.622 --> 02:22:09.043]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[02:22:09.143 --> 02:22:11.984]  Comment on what that last caller was saying.
[02:22:14.039 --> 02:22:14.359]  Yes.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:20.181]  The government, we've got in the documents, doesn't just have plans to carry out terror attacks and blame it on enemies.
[02:22:21.041 --> 02:22:31.624]  They also have plans to carry out earthquakes, volcanic activities, and I have the Secretary of Defense, folks, on the record in a national press conference saying they have these weapons.
[02:22:31.704 --> 02:22:32.444]  We have the patents.
[02:22:33.505 --> 02:22:34.245]  They can do that.
[02:22:34.825 --> 02:22:38.626]  There is a program going back to the 60s to have a fake alien invasion.
[02:22:40.396 --> 02:22:48.560]  With these big blimps all lit up, look like flying saucers, mainly to terrorize what they call ignorant or superstitious third world populations.
[02:22:49.661 --> 02:23:01.146]  They also have these things where, which they've admitted they have since the early 90s, they can project the 300 foot tall Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad, and they did some testing of that in Gulf War I, I read.
[02:23:02.827 --> 02:23:08.490]  They kind of just confuse and distract or freak out the Arabs and
[02:23:09.989 --> 02:23:10.829]  You know, holograms.
[02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:25.936]  You can have three jets with these big projectors in them flying and they lock in on a computer triangulator or basically it synchronizes all of them to make the hologram.
[02:23:25.956 --> 02:23:27.036]  That's what a hologram is.
[02:23:27.736 --> 02:23:29.237]  Three projectors coming together.
[02:23:30.618 --> 02:23:31.198]  They do have that.
[02:23:31.218 --> 02:23:31.578]  You're right.
[02:23:32.296 --> 02:23:40.001]  It's just, then there's all these kooks saying they're space travelers and time travelers and making predictions on the web, and they're always nebulous predictions.
[02:23:40.402 --> 02:23:42.963]  I predict there'll be a terror attack in the next two years.
[02:23:43.063 --> 02:23:43.464]  Wow.
[02:23:43.524 --> 02:23:49.768]  Well, did you predict that the World Trade Centers would be attacked and that Bin Laden would take the blame for it because he's a CIA asset?
[02:23:50.308 --> 02:23:51.369]  Did you say call the White House?
[02:23:51.409 --> 02:23:52.150]  They're about to do it.
[02:23:52.810 --> 02:23:53.611]  Two months before.
[02:23:53.631 --> 02:23:56.252]  Did you only make that one prediction at one time?
[02:23:56.272 --> 02:24:01.416]  And it's not because I'm psychic, folks, or I'm a time traveler.
[02:24:02.279 --> 02:24:05.922]  I saw them introducing bin Laden on TV as a boogeyman who's about to get you.
[02:24:06.322 --> 02:24:08.063]  I saw Glovo was bragging and giggling.
[02:24:08.483 --> 02:24:10.685]  I knew they'd already been preparing to attack the World Trade Center.
[02:24:10.725 --> 02:24:11.626]  I saw the whole thing.
[02:24:13.947 --> 02:24:14.908]  Because I have discernment.
[02:24:15.569 --> 02:24:19.972]  Because I guess I'm a low-grade moron, really, in my own view of myself.
[02:24:20.012 --> 02:24:24.695]  But compared to some people, I guess I'm a mental giant.
[02:24:24.835 --> 02:24:27.457]  Boy, that doesn't encourage me, let me tell you.
[02:24:29.656 --> 02:24:31.237]  I mean, how people just can't see this stuff.
[02:24:31.277 --> 02:24:31.978]  I just look around.
[02:24:32.018 --> 02:24:33.219]  I can see what they're doing.
[02:24:33.259 --> 02:24:33.920]  I know what they're doing.
[02:24:34.901 --> 02:24:36.602]  I guess you could say I'm tuned in, really.
[02:24:36.682 --> 02:24:37.923]  I use a hippie term.
[02:24:39.144 --> 02:24:45.010]  Let's go ahead and... Well, I'll get into Schwarzenegger in a minute since he mentioned it.
[02:24:45.310 --> 02:24:47.292]  That was in the stack here, but let's just keep going with calls.
[02:24:49.013 --> 02:24:50.454]  It may be allergies, too, folks.
[02:24:50.474 --> 02:24:52.016]  My allergies have been really bad.
[02:24:52.734 --> 02:24:56.697]  And every time I start getting them again, I go, why do I feel so bad?
[02:24:56.717 --> 02:24:57.958]  Oh, the next day I really get them.
[02:24:57.978 --> 02:24:58.959]  I hope that's not what's happening.
[02:24:59.039 --> 02:25:01.941]  I just feel kind of... I don't know if you can tell.
[02:25:02.041 --> 02:25:03.502]  I'm a little more calm than usual.
[02:25:04.323 --> 02:25:06.965]  Though I'm told some of you like that, so maybe this is better radio.
[02:25:08.486 --> 02:25:13.530]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Rick in Reno.
[02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:16.632]  How are things going there in Reno?
[02:25:16.732 --> 02:25:17.232]  Going good.
[02:25:17.392 --> 02:25:18.133]  How are you doing, man?
[02:25:18.253 --> 02:25:19.294]  Pretty good, compadre.
[02:25:20.050 --> 02:25:26.514]  I downloaded those two videos, Arnold Exposed, from your site, and I put them up on my file-sharing networks.
[02:25:27.855 --> 02:25:28.496]  Shareza?
[02:25:29.536 --> 02:25:34.760]  If you're familiar with Shareza, S-H-A-R-E-A-Z-A, that's the umbrella one.
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:35.740]  I'm familiar.
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:43.085]  If you download Shareza, folks, you can find arnoldexposed.com, that's the name of the video,
[02:25:43.979 --> 02:25:46.020]  That's the name I gave it on my file sharing network.
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:51.482]  ArnoldExposed.com Well, if you just go to ArnoldExposed.com, it's right there.
[02:25:51.622 --> 02:25:56.364]  By you doing that now, you're helping all those that don't even know about this show see it.
[02:25:57.044 --> 02:25:57.604]  That's true.
[02:25:57.844 --> 02:25:58.305]  Good job.
[02:25:58.625 --> 02:26:10.709]  And it's important to get these up on the file sharing networks, hence I gave the titles ArnoldExposed.com for the 60-second one and ArnoldExposed.com 2 for the 30-second one.
[02:26:11.310 --> 02:26:11.930]  Available now.
[02:26:13.982 --> 02:26:14.562]  Good job.
[02:26:15.203 --> 02:26:21.467]  Yeah, somebody wrote a journey up on the file sharing networks under the name Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:26:22.948 --> 02:26:25.249]  And it was listed on some of the file sharing networks.
[02:26:25.269 --> 02:26:26.330]  I mean, it was on a bunch of them.
[02:26:26.650 --> 02:26:29.772]  You know, shared 800,000 times.
[02:26:29.872 --> 02:26:32.734]  I mean, wow!
[02:26:33.334 --> 02:26:38.918]  Are you familiar, Alex, with the Huckleberry Bush political satire?
[02:26:41.041 --> 02:26:43.762]  You know, I'm familiar with a lot of that, but it doesn't ring a bell.
[02:26:44.102 --> 02:26:55.146]  At radio4all.net, that's radio4all.net, you can get the Huckleberry Bush political satire.
[02:26:55.506 --> 02:26:56.346]  These are hilarious.
[02:26:56.406 --> 02:26:58.527]  There's about 30 of them or so.
[02:26:59.027 --> 02:27:00.948]  So it's kind of in the vein of Mark Twain?
[02:27:01.650 --> 02:27:10.433]  Yeah, these guys, there's about half a dozen guys, and they use voices to parody the Cheney Cabal.
[02:27:10.553 --> 02:27:12.113]  I don't even include Bush anymore.
[02:27:12.133 --> 02:27:13.034]  He's such a dimwit.
[02:27:13.474 --> 02:27:17.675]  But the Cheney Cabal is brilliantly...
[02:27:18.337 --> 02:27:21.299]  Satired by these cats at Radio4All.net.
[02:27:21.619 --> 02:27:33.687]  And if you go on the file-sharing networks under the Sherazal umbrella, which includes LimeWire, includes Nutella One, Nutella Two, and E-Donkey 2000, the original AJ file-sharing network.
[02:27:33.707 --> 02:27:34.128]  Stay there.
[02:27:35.288 --> 02:27:36.209]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.689 --> 02:27:38.290]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.211 --> 02:27:41.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:37.898 --> 02:30:39.759]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:04.159 --> 02:31:08.903]  Finish up what you were talking about, Rick and Reno, real fast about file sharing.
[02:31:09.303 --> 02:31:15.328]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that the original file sharing network, eDonkey2000, is under the Sharer's umbrella.
[02:31:15.889 --> 02:31:16.269]  That's it.
[02:31:16.289 --> 02:31:17.050]  I'll let you go, man.
[02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:18.031]  Thank you.
[02:31:18.351 --> 02:31:27.518]  Yeah, folks, tens of millions of people, more than that, every day go on these myriad sites and you hear the...
[02:31:31.087 --> 02:31:40.414]  Recording industry known as the record company, screaming bloody murder, the movie makers, getting upset that this stuff is all over the internet.
[02:31:40.775 --> 02:31:41.896]  They're copyright material.
[02:31:41.936 --> 02:31:43.557]  Well, my material isn't copyright.
[02:31:45.218 --> 02:31:47.520]  As long as it's for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:49.662]  And so it's on a lot of these sites.
[02:31:50.883 --> 02:31:57.388]  And frankly, I never thought of the idea to dishonestly... But I guess it's war...
[02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:02.304]  Missed label, 9-11, the road to tyranny is Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:32:04.265 --> 02:32:19.859]  Back weeks before the film even came out, they named my video that, put it on some networks, it got shared everywhere, and I mean, I have been to sites and seen 800,000 downloads in the last 10 months or whatever it'll say.
[02:32:20.519 --> 02:32:23.702]  I mean, 800,000 people on one of those sites and it's on hundreds?
[02:32:24.452 --> 02:32:32.638]  I mean, we reached, as much as these nightly TV shows do, it took months and months to do it, but very effective.
[02:32:32.979 --> 02:32:34.920]  And that's what makes it all worthwhile.
[02:32:36.141 --> 02:32:40.384]  And so if I was really smart, I myself would be going and loading all this up on these sites.
[02:32:40.424 --> 02:32:43.487]  But you taking action and doing it is even more effective.
[02:32:44.067 --> 02:32:50.412]  I know that martial law, 9-11 rise of the police state has been loaded onto some networks out there.
[02:32:51.149 --> 02:32:53.710]  And I've clicked and seen how many times it's been watched.
[02:32:53.770 --> 02:32:55.190]  Thousands, it's not enough.
[02:32:55.870 --> 02:33:00.571]  That's, I guess, because people didn't give it a deceptive name that people were searching by the millions.
[02:33:01.892 --> 02:33:06.633]  Plus, you could name it Fahrenheit 9-11 right now.
[02:33:06.713 --> 02:33:09.914]  That isn't as hot as it was, so it would probably get hundreds of thousands, not millions.
[02:33:10.734 --> 02:33:14.135]  But there are ways to get it out there and get it seen, and it's up to you to do that.
[02:33:14.875 --> 02:33:18.096]  So I want to commend all those out there that have been doing that.
[02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:19.937]  I mean, we really are having an effect.
[02:33:19.957 --> 02:33:20.997]  We're reaching so many people.
[02:33:21.097 --> 02:33:23.538]  And that's another frustrating thing is I want to do a better job.
[02:33:25.159 --> 02:33:27.900]  And we've got so many people paying attention to just what I do.
[02:33:29.761 --> 02:33:31.021]  Little old Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.341 --> 02:33:38.344]  And I'll tell you, at a certain level, five, six, seven, eight, nine years ago, I had a bigger ego.
[02:33:40.445 --> 02:33:43.066]  And the ego is a powerful force to drive you.
[02:33:44.404 --> 02:33:48.107]  To get you to want to get out there and take action.
[02:33:48.147 --> 02:33:52.831]  I mean, my prime mover is fighting the New World Order because there are a bunch of out-of-control bullies.
[02:33:53.351 --> 02:33:55.973]  But I enjoyed also ego-wise doing this.
[02:33:56.794 --> 02:33:59.015]  And now, I don't have much of an ego.
[02:33:59.516 --> 02:34:02.999]  I mean, you've got to have an ego.
[02:34:03.039 --> 02:34:04.640]  You've got to have it in balance.
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:08.323]  You can't be egotistical and be on a power trip.
[02:34:08.763 --> 02:34:09.804]  And I was never like that.
[02:34:10.664 --> 02:34:11.245]  But I just...
[02:34:12.347 --> 02:34:15.630]  I kind of wish when somebody flips me off on the highway I'd get angry at them.
[02:34:16.391 --> 02:34:20.835]  I kind of wish I'd still get irritated by cops getting in my face.
[02:34:21.135 --> 02:34:27.181]  I kind of wish I'd get a thrill off seeing myself on national TV.
[02:34:27.662 --> 02:34:28.022]  I don't.
[02:34:30.805 --> 02:34:32.726]  I do get a thrill off waking people up.
[02:34:33.727 --> 02:34:37.471]  I get a thrill off seeing you take action and doing a great job doing it, by the way.
[02:34:38.690 --> 02:34:42.671]  And I just want to commend everybody out there for all the great work they've done.
[02:34:42.731 --> 02:34:46.072]  I mean, you do such a better job than I do in so many cases.
[02:34:47.293 --> 02:34:52.154]  Alright, a caller earlier mentioned Schwarzenegger, and this is out of the Associated Press.
[02:34:52.174 --> 02:34:55.175]  And I guess Paul Watson put this comment above the article.
[02:34:55.595 --> 02:34:57.815]  Schwarzenegger has been pro-illegals all along.
[02:34:58.136 --> 02:35:02.857]  He's merely polishing up his rhetoric in time to hoodwink a conservative base into supporting his...
[02:35:04.565 --> 02:35:08.448]  I would add a gubernatorial rerun or an 08-012 presidential run.
[02:35:09.008 --> 02:35:15.433]  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday his nation's policy on preventing illegal immigration is too lax.
[02:35:16.113 --> 02:35:19.196]  The only group of newspaper publishers in the United States needs to close the borders.
[02:35:20.837 --> 02:35:23.258]  That's because almost 90% of people want that.
[02:35:24.619 --> 02:35:27.622]  And so they have to act like... I agree with the caller in some respects.
[02:35:27.642 --> 02:35:30.163]  They have to act like that we've got a steam valve.
[02:35:30.203 --> 02:35:30.824]  That people are...
[02:35:31.570 --> 02:35:34.752]  Trying to help us, that we can still trust the government.
[02:35:35.132 --> 02:35:38.174]  Then the government does nothing, and then we go back to sleep.
[02:35:39.375 --> 02:35:46.519]  Close the borders in California and all across Mexico and the United States, Schwarzenegger said, at an annual meeting of the Newspaper Association of America.
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:55.845]  Because I think it's just unfair to have all those people coming across, have the borders open the way it is, and have the kind of lax situation.
[02:35:57.647 --> 02:35:58.187]  Whatever that means.
[02:35:58.846 --> 02:36:03.849]  Schwarzenegger's remarks were later clarified by a spokesman who said the governor supports greater security along the nation.
[02:36:04.229 --> 02:36:06.570]  Borders was not calling for the complete closure.
[02:36:08.852 --> 02:36:10.733]  Schwarzenegger was for blanket amnesty.
[02:36:10.933 --> 02:36:11.653]  Bush is for it.
[02:36:11.673 --> 02:36:17.196]  You know, why does Lou Dobbs come out and people kept saying, you've got to watch him, you've got to watch him.
[02:36:17.216 --> 02:36:22.259]  Well, I've watched it a few times the last couple of years, and every other night it's about the Borders.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:25.901]  But then his answer is National ID cards.
[02:36:26.508 --> 02:36:31.011]  But then they pass the National ID Card legislation, and there's a loophole for illegal aliens in it.
[02:36:32.552 --> 02:36:40.377]  So see how they build up a crisis and a threat and something that needs to be addressed, problem, reaction, and their solution is something that makes it worse.
[02:36:41.627 --> 02:36:48.172]  The governor has talked before about his need to ensure the immigrants are put on a path toward fully participating in California's economy.
[02:36:48.212 --> 02:36:56.658]  Spokeswoman Margaret Thompson said that he feels they need to enter the country the right way and must not undermine import security issues.
[02:36:56.758 --> 02:36:58.880]  He feels that the border needs to be secure.
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:09.147]  During a speech, Schwarzenegger also suggested exploring several policy proposals aimed at addressing illegal immigration, including President Bush's proposed guest worker program, which is total amnesty.
[02:37:09.548 --> 02:37:10.949]  So there it is, see?
[02:37:11.610 --> 02:37:15.993]  They just label stopping the illegals as amnesty, and we go, good!
[02:37:17.493 --> 02:37:18.374]  Give us that then!
[02:37:18.394 --> 02:37:26.779]  When Bush's plan makes all the illegals that are here legal, anyone who can get here legal, and allows corporations to pay to bring in skilled and unskilled workers.
[02:37:27.359 --> 02:37:32.522]  And yeah, Americans don't want jobs as computer programmers anymore because they get paid as much as a McDonald's employee.
[02:37:33.846 --> 02:37:34.567]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:37:34.967 --> 02:37:49.939]  The millions of Indians working overseas or coming into the country who will work for $10, $12 an hour are displacing the Americans that paid $100,000 for their education and have children in school and have insurance and cannot live on that!
[02:37:50.599 --> 02:37:52.481]  You've driven the wages down by design!
[02:37:52.521 --> 02:37:53.541]  It isn't free market!
[02:37:57.785 --> 02:38:00.587]  These foreigners are doing jobs nobody wants.
[02:38:00.727 --> 02:38:01.047]  Oh yeah?
[02:38:01.127 --> 02:38:01.868]  And did you know
[02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:13.493]  Even if you look at numbers that cook the books to where it looks like illegals help us, all those books don't show the cost of health care and crime and all of it.
[02:38:14.153 --> 02:38:20.375]  $3 billion a year in California alone, alone in incarcerating them.
[02:38:21.115 --> 02:38:26.577]  It's like another, strangely enough, $3 billion to pay for all their health care.
[02:38:28.490 --> 02:38:29.391]  And folks, I've seen it.
[02:38:29.431 --> 02:38:37.137]  I've been sitting there with my finger almost completely cut off a year and a half ago helping some more illegal aliens.
[02:38:37.197 --> 02:38:38.338]  I guarantee they were illegal aliens.
[02:38:38.358 --> 02:38:42.561]  It was a bunch of these Arabs out on a pontoon boat, didn't know what they were doing.
[02:38:43.782 --> 02:38:48.346]  And it was rough water and I jumped in to go help them and slid off and almost cut my finger off.
[02:38:48.366 --> 02:38:54.371]  But the point is, as I get there and I'm watching illegal aliens go past Hispanics, whites, blacks, you name it, it doesn't matter.
[02:38:55.313 --> 02:38:56.054]  Because they're illegal.
[02:38:56.074 --> 02:38:57.034]  They know they don't have insurance.
[02:38:57.054 --> 02:38:58.155]  Well, just the city pays for it.
[02:38:58.175 --> 02:38:59.116]  We'll just go right past.
[02:38:59.176 --> 02:38:59.796]  Go right past.
[02:39:00.517 --> 02:39:05.640]  As I sat there for an hour and a half, blood spilling out.
[02:39:06.681 --> 02:39:08.542]  And that's how it is in California, boy.
[02:39:10.223 --> 02:39:14.886]  Hatch has got a bill to give illegal aliens, and most states already do this, more tuition than citizens.
[02:39:15.206 --> 02:39:16.467]  Why do you think that is?
[02:39:17.168 --> 02:39:20.890]  La Reconquistas and Meches and La Razzies and all of you.
[02:39:21.390 --> 02:39:23.652]  Because you may be all prideful citizens,
[02:39:24.542 --> 02:39:29.845]  You know, reading comic books that the Mexican government publishes down there to tell you you're taking over the Southwest.
[02:39:30.385 --> 02:39:33.026]  Well, why is the old white man funding you then?
[02:39:33.046 --> 02:39:34.967]  Because they wanted to kill this country, folks.
[02:39:35.688 --> 02:39:37.589]  But again, most Hispanics are against open borders.
[02:39:37.609 --> 02:39:38.950]  They're patriotic as anybody else.
[02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:45.593]  And so the worm has turned, so they just are playing bait and switch again.
[02:39:46.493 --> 02:39:52.957]  Oh, we're against illegal aliens, and so we've got to support Bush's plan.
[02:39:57.875 --> 02:39:58.475]  It's unbelievable.
[02:40:00.796 --> 02:40:03.237]  And so now I'll be argued with by so-called conservatives.
[02:40:03.557 --> 02:40:04.837]  See, Arnold's conservative.
[02:40:04.877 --> 02:40:06.138]  He's against the illegals.
[02:40:06.438 --> 02:40:07.818]  You're a liar, Alex.
[02:40:07.858 --> 02:40:09.419]  He's from Bush's plan.
[02:40:10.299 --> 02:40:12.240]  Bush's plan.
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:18.242]  Well, yeah, I mean, the police could say we are going to cure and solve the murder problem.
[02:40:18.262 --> 02:40:19.982]  There'll never be another murder in America.
[02:40:21.783 --> 02:40:22.703]  Well, how are you going to do that?
[02:40:23.003 --> 02:40:25.884]  Well, we're just not going to call it murder anymore and we're going to legalize it.
[02:40:26.985 --> 02:40:27.445]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:28.528 --> 02:40:29.709]  We've cured cancer.
[02:40:30.009 --> 02:40:32.732]  There'll never be another case of cancer in America.
[02:40:34.073 --> 02:40:36.254]  These are the word games they play, literally at this level.
[02:40:37.315 --> 02:40:40.678]  We have cured cancer.
[02:40:40.698 --> 02:40:41.939]  There will never be cancer again.
[02:40:41.999 --> 02:40:42.899]  Well, how do you do that?
[02:40:42.939 --> 02:40:46.902]  Well, we're changing the name and saying cancer doesn't exist.
[02:40:51.446 --> 02:40:55.349]  We're calling them fuzzy-feely happy blobs.
[02:40:58.639 --> 02:41:01.401]  I mean, it's like they euthanize people forcibly and then call it love.
[02:41:02.002 --> 02:41:03.303]  They call new freedom, new freedom.
[02:41:03.323 --> 02:41:05.004]  They call the Patriot Act the Patriot Act.
[02:41:05.024 --> 02:41:06.566]  They're totally opposite of what it is.
[02:41:08.127 --> 02:41:09.208]  People just lap it up.
[02:41:09.268 --> 02:41:10.329]  I just turn and argue with them.
[02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:17.034]  People just want to believe whatever the buzzword is, the one-liner is.
[02:41:18.856 --> 02:41:20.477]  I am against the illegal aliens.
[02:41:20.857 --> 02:41:24.641]  I want the Bush's plan, which totally legalizes all of them.
[02:41:25.842 --> 02:41:26.302]  Ha ha!
[02:41:28.933 --> 02:41:29.753]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:33.615 --> 02:41:34.536]  But they know what they're doing.
[02:41:34.576 --> 02:41:37.918]  Speaking of cancer, Jack McClam's wife's got breast cancer.
[02:41:38.838 --> 02:41:44.821]  And so we want to pray that they'll make the right decisions and get the best treatment.
[02:41:47.202 --> 02:41:48.303]  Jack's a really good guy.
[02:41:48.363 --> 02:41:51.584]  I know his wife is a really good lady, and I'm sad to hear that.
[02:41:53.645 --> 02:41:58.728]  It's sad when friends and people that are doing a great job get struck by tragedy, but
[02:42:00.034 --> 02:42:04.477]  But that's what happens in life, and hopefully I believe she'll get better.
[02:42:04.517 --> 02:42:05.738]  It's very treatable, generally.
[02:42:10.842 --> 02:42:14.745]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls.
[02:42:14.765 --> 02:42:16.306]  I'll get back into some more of this news here.
[02:42:17.227 --> 02:42:18.007]  I'm going to move quick now.
[02:42:18.027 --> 02:42:20.409]  I'm giving each person about 60 seconds because I want to give everybody time.
[02:42:20.449 --> 02:42:23.051]  I don't like cramming five calls in the last two minutes of the show.
[02:42:24.472 --> 02:42:27.354]  Let's talk to Skunk in Kansas City.
[02:42:27.927 --> 02:42:29.388]  Hey Alex, how are you doing this afternoon?
[02:42:29.408 --> 02:42:31.530]  I'm doing fine, my nocturnal friend.
[02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:35.833]  Listen, you know, it sounds like you got a little down at the beginning of the show.
[02:42:35.853 --> 02:42:39.715]  I just want to let you know that your word does, you know, spread and reach people.
[02:42:40.496 --> 02:42:41.777]  You know, I consider your family.
[02:42:41.797 --> 02:42:44.699]  You're in my house every day between, you know, 11 a.m.
[02:42:44.759 --> 02:42:46.720]  and 2 in the afternoon Central Time.
[02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:53.745]  So, you know, the amount of people's eyes that you've opened, you know, pales in comparison to the amount of people that call your show.
[02:42:54.746 --> 02:43:05.173]  Secondly, the funny thing that the guy brought up earlier about listing Fahrenheit 9-11 on the file sharing service, that is actually how I found your first video, Road to Tyranny.
[02:43:06.014 --> 02:43:16.060]  I was looking up Fahrenheit 9-11 because at the time I was under some type of impression that Michael Moore was one of the good guys, and then I actually saw your movie.
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:17.401]  Well, let's be sneaky.
[02:43:18.141 --> 02:43:18.562]  Exactly.
[02:43:18.602 --> 02:43:19.422]  Let's be sneaky.
[02:43:19.522 --> 02:43:20.403]  Let's list...
[02:43:21.374 --> 02:43:28.617]  Martial law, 9-11 rise, the police state as Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.
[02:43:29.017 --> 02:43:29.618]  Exactly.
[02:43:29.658 --> 02:43:32.479]  It's all clandestine operations, man.
[02:43:32.539 --> 02:43:36.961]  I know, but once we start down that path, it's not good to ever be dishonest.
[02:43:37.441 --> 02:43:41.683]  But we still got to do what we got to do to get the good word across.
[02:43:42.723 --> 02:43:44.324]  Just a real quick story.
[02:43:44.384 --> 02:43:47.005]  Over the weekend, I was in Kansas City traveling on 29.
[02:43:47.205 --> 02:43:48.305]  I got pulled over.
[02:43:50.313 --> 02:43:51.995]  I'm cruising down the highway in my car.
[02:43:52.235 --> 02:43:54.878]  Cruise control set at the speed limit.
[02:43:55.018 --> 02:43:56.059]  Cruiser comes by me.
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:58.361]  No problem with me.
[02:43:58.401 --> 02:44:01.144]  He comes by me in the left-hand lane going at a higher rate of speed.
[02:44:01.164 --> 02:44:01.805]  He sees me.
[02:44:02.521 --> 02:44:04.862]  Brakes go on, he drops behind me, hits the lights.
[02:44:05.403 --> 02:44:06.243]  I don't even know why.
[02:44:06.363 --> 02:44:07.644]  Still don't know why.
[02:44:07.664 --> 02:44:11.546]  He pulls me over, he comes up to the car, asks for all my paperwork, given the paperwork.
[02:44:11.586 --> 02:44:16.028]  He comes back, he goes, you know, he probably ran my name, found out that I have a record from when I was younger.
[02:44:16.949 --> 02:44:20.051]  Comes back and says, you know, do I have your permission to search the vehicle?
[02:44:20.491 --> 02:44:21.051]  I said, no.
[02:44:21.591 --> 02:44:23.292]  He said, well, what, do you have something to hide?
[02:44:23.312 --> 02:44:26.034]  I go, no, I have something to protect my constitutional rights.
[02:44:26.915 --> 02:44:34.482]  And I said, you know, if you want to go get a powder dog or a drug dog to come and sniff around my car to see if it gets a hit, fine.
[02:44:34.522 --> 02:44:36.784]  Then you'll have probable cause to go into my car.
[02:44:36.804 --> 02:44:38.966]  But before that, I'm not going to cooperate with you.
[02:44:39.727 --> 02:44:43.630]  So a couple more cruisers show up, and then a patrol supervisor shows up.
[02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:47.514]  And after seeing the patrol supervisor talk to the car for about 10 minutes, wasting my time,
[02:44:49.564 --> 02:44:53.986]  The patrolman comes back highly agitated and says, Fine, you're free to go.
[02:44:54.127 --> 02:44:56.208]  And I reply, I was always free to go.
[02:44:56.228 --> 02:44:58.929]  You never put my freedom in jeopardy.
[02:44:58.989 --> 02:44:59.670]  I know my rights.
[02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:05.073]  I drove away and now the bad thing is I can basically see the police station from my house.
[02:45:05.633 --> 02:45:08.635]  I've got to drive by it on a daily basis.
[02:45:08.735 --> 02:45:09.456]  I'm self-employed.
[02:45:09.476 --> 02:45:13.379]  I make shipments out of the post office every day, so I've got to go by it every day now.
[02:45:13.419 --> 02:45:16.421]  People have got to realize, don't be scared.
[02:45:16.521 --> 02:45:17.302]  Don't be scared.
[02:45:17.522 --> 02:45:20.904]  There's nothing they can do to you except take your freedom and lock you up.
[02:45:21.385 --> 02:45:25.528]  As long as you know what you're doing is right, they can't take that away from you.
[02:45:25.768 --> 02:45:28.670]  People get pulled over and they start to get afraid of the police.
[02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:29.771]  Don't be afraid.
[02:45:30.436 --> 02:45:32.257]  Stand up for yourself.
[02:45:32.297 --> 02:45:33.717]  They don't own us.
[02:45:33.857 --> 02:45:35.098]  And I'm tired of this.
[02:45:35.518 --> 02:45:37.558]  We've got to take your rights to stop the drugs.
[02:45:37.579 --> 02:45:39.479]  Your bosses ship the drugs in.
[02:45:40.059 --> 02:45:42.700]  The cartels they bust are the people that didn't pay their cut.
[02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:43.761]  Everybody knows it.
[02:45:44.081 --> 02:45:46.402]  Your drug war doubles in size every ten years.
[02:45:46.722 --> 02:45:48.822]  And you know there's more drugs on the streets than ever.
[02:45:49.142 --> 02:45:51.103]  There is.
[02:45:51.863 --> 02:45:53.264]  I don't use any of their garbage.
[02:45:53.764 --> 02:45:56.326]  But still, I'm going to tell them, no, you can't search my car.
[02:45:56.686 --> 02:45:57.206]  Exactly.
[02:45:57.346 --> 02:45:58.267]  Exercise your rights.
[02:45:58.287 --> 02:45:59.608]  You have rights for a reason.
[02:45:59.908 --> 02:46:00.228]  Use them.
[02:46:00.408 --> 02:46:01.889]  I see on cops all the time.
[02:46:01.949 --> 02:46:04.271]  I'll watch it once in a while if there's not one on Saturday night.
[02:46:04.631 --> 02:46:05.932]  And I'll see all these morons.
[02:46:06.272 --> 02:46:07.193]  Can I search your vehicle?
[02:46:07.753 --> 02:46:09.394]  Uh, uh, uh, okay.
[02:46:09.474 --> 02:46:10.855]  And next thing you know, they get arrested.
[02:46:11.035 --> 02:46:11.936]  Exercise your rights.
[02:46:12.529 --> 02:46:17.791]  But no, they don't show the people that stand up to the police, whether it be physical or, you know, legally.
[02:46:18.111 --> 02:46:18.811]  They don't show it.
[02:46:18.831 --> 02:46:20.292]  Well, that's another thing on these cop shows.
[02:46:20.432 --> 02:46:22.532]  The person they always search is always guilty.
[02:46:22.792 --> 02:46:23.133]  Exactly.
[02:46:23.153 --> 02:46:25.293]  They don't tell you there's 20 they searched that were innocent.
[02:46:25.553 --> 02:46:28.634]  So it creates a perception that all of us are guilty.
[02:46:28.895 --> 02:46:29.455]  Exactly.
[02:46:29.515 --> 02:46:30.595]  Man, amazing points.
[02:46:30.635 --> 02:46:31.175]  Good call.
[02:46:31.215 --> 02:46:31.936]  Good to hear from you.
[02:46:32.556 --> 02:46:35.057]  See, I said I'd give the caller a minute, but that caller was so good.
[02:46:35.737 --> 02:46:36.757]  Yeah, that's the plan.
[02:46:37.057 --> 02:46:39.018]  Re-upload my videos every week.
[02:46:39.802 --> 02:46:42.803]  Naming it the new name of the popular hottest film.
[02:46:44.204 --> 02:46:48.466]  And then when people search it to get an internet rip, they'll run into the truth.
[02:46:48.486 --> 02:46:54.228]  I don't know, that listener that figured that out, I mean, is it good to do?
[02:46:54.248 --> 02:47:02.091]  I mean, 800,000 people, one spot, download A Road to Tyranny, because they were looking for Fahrenheit 9-11 and found mine?
[02:47:02.691 --> 02:47:04.292]  I didn't do that, but it was a great idea.
[02:47:04.312 --> 02:47:07.994]  And, uh... I don't know.
[02:47:11.005 --> 02:47:12.986]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:47:13.026 --> 02:47:14.767]  I mean, it is an information war, I guess.
[02:47:15.727 --> 02:47:18.289]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Ohio.
[02:47:18.329 --> 02:47:19.049]  Don, go ahead.
[02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:27.114]  Yeah, before Arnold got into power, Mussolini had a lawsuit against Enron for, I think, $13 billion.
[02:47:27.214 --> 02:47:28.995]  Has anything ever happened to it?
[02:47:29.395 --> 02:47:32.457]  Arnold was at that meeting figuring out how to stop Enron from going down.
[02:47:32.477 --> 02:47:34.998]  And no, Arnold never got... He ran.
[02:47:35.198 --> 02:47:37.079]  I'm going to stop them at the Enron.
[02:47:37.379 --> 02:47:38.520]  Bad Gray Davis!
[02:47:39.252 --> 02:47:43.354]  Well, Davis was bad, but not because of Enron, and it doesn't make you good, Arnold.
[02:47:43.414 --> 02:47:44.655]  I mean, so it's classic.
[02:47:44.715 --> 02:47:52.679]  He's involved with Enron and Milken and the rest of them, but then he's elected on stopping the evil Enron.
[02:47:54.079 --> 02:47:57.561]  Second thought, they've got the benefit going now for the toll roads down in Texas.
[02:47:57.801 --> 02:48:05.085]  I'd like to see something, you know, if somebody can arrange it, benefiting the future of the Minutemen down there.
[02:48:06.417 --> 02:48:06.837]  I agree.
[02:48:06.897 --> 02:48:09.699]  We can only do so much, so why don't you organize something?
[02:48:10.039 --> 02:48:14.442]  Well, I can't exactly here, but I'd like to see it done anyways.
[02:48:14.462 --> 02:48:17.164]  Another thought.
[02:48:18.685 --> 02:48:34.095]  The oil reserves that we have, is anybody making sure that Bush isn't basically taking some of the shipments and having them driven to Texas and pumping them down into his empty oil wells like Barbusta?
[02:48:35.402 --> 02:48:36.362]  Well, they don't even do that.
[02:48:37.002 --> 02:48:39.823]  Government all the time is stealing the reserves and manipulating.
[02:48:40.903 --> 02:48:41.803]  That's par for the course.
[02:48:41.843 --> 02:48:43.464]  There's trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[02:48:43.984 --> 02:48:44.424]  Good point.
[02:48:45.124 --> 02:48:49.485]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:49.645 --> 02:48:54.086]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.226 --> 02:48:58.607]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:58.647 --> 02:48:59.947]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.770 --> 02:49:05.993]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.053 --> 02:49:12.999]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.119 --> 02:49:15.200]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:25.848]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.129 --> 02:49:30.432]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3,

[02:50:37.054 --> 02:50:41.258]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:41.398 --> 02:50:42.839]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:45.622 --> 02:50:51.588]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:51.808 --> 02:50:54.070]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:51:16.488 --> 02:51:17.008]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.028 --> 02:51:17.329]  I think?
[02:51:54.797 --> 02:51:58.699]  New Pope's brother very concerned about his election, AFP reports.
[02:51:59.119 --> 02:52:02.040]  The brother of Pope Benedict XVI, George Ratzinger, 81.
[02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:10.384]  They said he was very concerned and shocked upon hearing the Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had been elected as the head of the Roman Catholic Church because of his age and frail health.
[02:52:11.525 --> 02:52:11.945]  And, uh,
[02:52:13.106 --> 02:52:17.688]  Continuing, Oregon bill requires driver's license applicants to register for the draft.
[02:52:19.649 --> 02:52:27.291]  A very, very serious house bill, 2575, will automatically register young men for selective service when they sign up for licenses or state identification cards.
[02:52:27.311 --> 02:52:28.532]  It's under federal funding, by the way.
[02:52:29.921 --> 02:52:30.481]  Listen to this.
[02:52:31.002 --> 02:52:33.323]  Truck drivers bristle in anti-terror rules.
[02:52:33.363 --> 02:52:35.544]  The new rules will affect two-thirds of truck drivers.
[02:52:36.025 --> 02:52:38.386]  They are already checked against an anti-terror database.
[02:52:38.786 --> 02:52:44.950]  Now two-thirds of them will have to go through extensive federal background checks and questioning, and they get special ID cards.
[02:52:45.490 --> 02:52:49.553]  And I saw a register three years ago on C-SPAN that you'll have this for every job soon.
[02:52:50.173 --> 02:52:51.214]  They're just phasing it in.
[02:52:51.254 --> 02:52:53.315]  That's out of USA Today.
[02:52:54.986 --> 02:52:56.767]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[02:52:56.867 --> 02:52:59.368]  Dave in Michigan, then Esther in Missouri.
[02:52:59.728 --> 02:53:00.528]  All I have time for.
[02:53:00.568 --> 02:53:01.388]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:53:03.109 --> 02:53:05.770]  Question, comment, and a suggestion on martial law.
[02:53:06.130 --> 02:53:06.550]  Hit it.
[02:53:06.810 --> 02:53:12.592]  First comment, I love the scene where the woman has the puppet and you're doing the mini-me of Lord Bush.
[02:53:12.632 --> 02:53:18.334]  That's some much-needed laughter in the middle of some very serious issues.
[02:53:18.434 --> 02:53:19.154]  Very, very funny.
[02:53:19.375 --> 02:53:21.015]  So you could tell that was me doing the puppet?
[02:53:21.355 --> 02:53:23.236]  Yeah, oh my God, it's hilarious, Alex.
[02:53:24.563 --> 02:53:25.963]  And then, let's see.
[02:53:26.444 --> 02:53:28.844]  Suggestion.
[02:53:28.964 --> 02:53:30.404]  I want to do the copy of the disc.
[02:53:30.824 --> 02:53:31.964]  I'm having trouble doing it.
[02:53:32.345 --> 02:53:35.985]  Any listeners out there have a tried and proven method?
[02:53:36.105 --> 02:53:36.945]  It's a DVD-9.
[02:53:37.225 --> 02:53:38.866]  It's a DVD-9.
[02:53:39.186 --> 02:53:41.586]  You can buy for $50 a DVD-9 burner.
[02:53:42.126 --> 02:53:42.506]  Okay.
[02:53:42.686 --> 02:53:46.087]  Or just play it long play into a VCR and make VCR copies.
[02:53:46.547 --> 02:53:46.807]  All right.
[02:53:47.847 --> 02:53:48.567]  That's the problem.
[02:53:48.607 --> 02:53:50.888]  It has to be a DVD-9 to put all...
[02:53:52.353 --> 02:53:53.953]  All three hours on one disc.
[02:53:54.554 --> 02:53:55.634]  Okay.
[02:53:56.154 --> 02:53:57.154]  Perhaps that's why.
[02:53:57.254 --> 02:53:59.495]  It wouldn't work in my DVD player.
[02:53:59.515 --> 02:54:04.156]  It worked on my computer after I burned the copy, but it wouldn't work in a regular DVD player for some reason.
[02:54:04.476 --> 02:54:06.196]  You're saying the disc doesn't work, period?
[02:54:07.336 --> 02:54:09.577]  Yeah, it says that it won't play this type of disc.
[02:54:09.597 --> 02:54:19.439]  That's why I'm thinking, well, it's a DVD plus R. Maybe they need a DVD minus R. Yeah, maybe one out of 200 people to get my DVD nines, some...
[02:54:20.695 --> 02:54:20.895]  Old?
[02:54:21.316 --> 02:54:23.018]  You must have a really old DVD player.
[02:54:23.358 --> 02:54:24.219]  Actually, it's pretty new.
[02:54:24.239 --> 02:54:26.441]  It's a brand new Panasonic portable.
[02:54:26.481 --> 02:54:27.562]  Oh, it's Panasonic.
[02:54:28.003 --> 02:54:29.124]  That's the ones.
[02:54:29.424 --> 02:54:30.986]  Panasonic portables, the little ones.
[02:54:31.525 --> 02:54:31.845]  Yeah.
[02:54:32.365 --> 02:54:32.906]  Every case.
[02:54:32.946 --> 02:54:33.826]  Yeah, it's only been a few.
[02:54:33.846 --> 02:54:35.566]  I think it's like five cases that we've had.
[02:54:35.586 --> 02:54:35.887]  No kidding.
[02:54:36.107 --> 02:54:36.487]  No kidding.
[02:54:36.787 --> 02:54:38.387]  Okay, well then maybe it's not a problem.
[02:54:39.128 --> 02:54:56.834]  And then my question was, in the movie, there's a scene where it comes down to a point where you start to describe how when the so-called terrorists boarded the plane, that they released the gas on board the plane and knocked everybody out, and then these planes were taken over by remote control and flown into their target.
[02:54:57.802 --> 02:55:00.243]  I was wondering where you got that information.
[02:55:00.324 --> 02:55:00.964]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:01.044 --> 02:55:02.645]  I've got to let you go.
[02:55:02.665 --> 02:55:06.067]  I could have spent two more hours on 9-11 in the film.
[02:55:06.547 --> 02:55:12.090]  That's from all the different sources we have, about 100 different sources literally, and how the globalists carried it out.
[02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:13.871]  I just don't have time to answer that question.
[02:55:15.172 --> 02:55:16.513]  We proved they're government agents.
[02:55:16.553 --> 02:55:17.873]  We proved it was remote control.
[02:55:18.534 --> 02:55:19.594]  I'm just flat out of time.
[02:55:19.614 --> 02:55:20.395]  I'm sorry to Esther.
[02:55:21.685 --> 02:55:22.006]  You know what?
[02:55:22.026 --> 02:55:23.588]  I'll just go to Esther and I won't plug the film.
[02:55:24.028 --> 02:55:25.630]  Esther in Missouri, go ahead.
[02:55:25.710 --> 02:55:27.452]  I was afraid I wouldn't get to talk to you.
[02:55:27.652 --> 02:55:28.173]  That's all right.
[02:55:28.213 --> 02:55:28.573]  Go ahead.
[02:55:29.915 --> 02:55:34.800]  This is, and I'm late getting in on it, National Grassroots Voice Day.
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:38.805]  And what this is all about, there's a lot of organizations all over the U.S.
[02:55:38.905 --> 02:55:39.846]  involved in this.
[02:55:40.589 --> 02:55:47.293]  And the idea is for each person to contact their members of Congress, and as you said, hit them upside the head.
[02:55:48.134 --> 02:55:52.016]  The major thing is on the energy.
[02:55:52.496 --> 02:55:58.540]  They've had an energy bill sitting there for five years that they've been kicking around playing with like a...
[02:55:59.293 --> 02:56:00.893]  Yeah, to go into Alaska.
[02:56:01.373 --> 02:56:01.673]  Pardon?
[02:56:01.853 --> 02:56:05.934]  Bush has the House, the Senate, the Legislative, the Executive, the Judiciary.
[02:56:06.134 --> 02:56:06.514]  Right.
[02:56:06.574 --> 02:56:07.654]  And none of that ever happens.
[02:56:07.715 --> 02:56:08.495]  Out of time, Esther.
[02:56:09.035 --> 02:56:09.575]  Out of time.
[02:56:09.615 --> 02:56:10.915]  The new film, Martial Law, is out.
[02:56:10.935 --> 02:56:11.555]  I hope you get it.
[02:56:12.355 --> 02:56:13.936]  And Dave, call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:13.956 --> 02:56:15.736]  I'll try to go over that and answer that question.
[02:56:16.376 --> 02:56:18.816]  It'll take like 30 minutes, but we'll try to do it.
[02:56:19.377 --> 02:56:24.637]  And I'll see you tomorrow night at the Toons Not Tolls at the Doubletree North.
[02:56:24.737 --> 02:56:26.298]  Jimmy Vaughn, everybody else will be out there.
[02:56:26.318 --> 02:56:27.638]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.911]  All right.
[02:56:29.252 --> 02:56:31.015]  As I said, see you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:31.035 --> 02:56:31.837]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:31.877 --> 02:56:32.238]  God bless.
