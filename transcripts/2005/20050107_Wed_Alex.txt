[00:00.000 --> 00:06.600]  Coming up in a few minutes, we're going to play this little two-minute news piece from
[00:06.600 --> 00:10.280]  a local NBC station in Kansas City.
[00:10.280 --> 00:16.440]  Of course, we happen to have an affiliate, KCXL, doing a great job in Kansas City.
[00:16.440 --> 00:20.720]  But this is a problem that faces America, that faces Iraq, that faces Serbia, that faces
[00:20.720 --> 00:21.720]  Afghanistan.
[00:21.720 --> 00:27.240]  There are over 10 proving rounds in the United States where DU, depleted uranium, munitions
[00:27.240 --> 00:29.360]  are used.
[00:29.360 --> 00:35.200]  Depleted uranium is a byproduct of nuclear weapons production and have spent fuel rods
[00:35.200 --> 00:37.440]  from nuclear power plants.
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.360]  The heavy metal effect of it is deadly enough and will kill you or make you very ill.
[00:44.360 --> 00:51.840]  But the New York Daily News about eight months ago did a test of 14 different soldiers who
[00:51.840 --> 00:56.000]  said they were ill and were losing weight, having these high fevers.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.440]  Every one of them had high levels of radiation, upwards of two rims.
[01:01.440 --> 01:05.960]  Two rims will kill most people in long-term exposure.
[01:05.960 --> 01:12.240]  And it's long-term exposure because it sits in the lungs and settles out in the bones.
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.280]  And do we have that news clip?
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.120]  John, did you say we have that clip?
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.560]  Okay, let's go ahead and play that clip and then we'll go.
[01:21.560 --> 01:27.440]  I know it's hard for him to listen to again, but Dwayne, the father of Clayton, who spent
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.600]  16 months in Iraq, but here's that little newscast clip and our hearts and prayers
[01:32.600 --> 01:36.280]  just go out to him and there'll be a phone number at the end of how you can contribute
[01:36.280 --> 01:37.280]  to the family.
[01:37.280 --> 01:38.280]  I think it's a good idea.
[01:38.280 --> 01:39.280]  Go ahead and play it.
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.920]  The soldier survives Iraq, but dies of a mysterious illness.
[01:42.920 --> 01:43.920]  Do you have a job?
[01:43.920 --> 01:44.920]  The government is hiding.
[01:44.920 --> 01:48.960]  And if the Action News reporter, Ron Mott, is live with the story, you'll see only on
[01:48.960 --> 01:49.960]  NBC Action News.
[01:49.960 --> 01:50.960]  Ron?
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.440]  It's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned by their
[01:55.440 --> 01:56.440]  own ammo.
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.240]  They, of course, are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.800]  into unfriendly fire.
[02:02.800 --> 02:10.480]  You know, they come out five minutes since he's gone.
[02:10.480 --> 02:14.520]  For nearly a year and a half, Dwayne Garten worried that his son might return from Iraq
[02:14.520 --> 02:15.520]  in a body bag.
[02:15.520 --> 02:18.560]  And this is worse than they could have got killed, but we were really.
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.760]  That decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Garten spent an agonizing three weeks dying
[02:23.760 --> 02:27.840]  in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the
[02:27.840 --> 02:29.400]  day after Christmas.
[02:29.400 --> 02:36.680]  Thirty-five years, I had no boy, he went to 16 months of hell if they'd come back and
[02:36.680 --> 02:38.400]  they didn't do nothing for him.
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.040]  That's what I don't understand, why they couldn't do something for him.
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.000]  This is Seth and this is Mr. Gage.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.320]  A father of three, Clay Garten's family believes the Army medic is every bit of casualty of
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.280]  war as those who die on the front lines after they say he became exposed to depleted uranium
[02:55.280 --> 02:57.720]  dust used in some U.S. ammunition.
[02:57.720 --> 03:00.160]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[03:00.160 --> 03:04.040]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.080]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.920]  The family says Garten lost 30 pounds before he died, starting with a debilitating backspasm
[03:12.920 --> 03:18.600]  earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[03:18.600 --> 03:28.240]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big, strong, intelligent man to turn into a small
[03:28.240 --> 03:29.240]  person.
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.440]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.440]  That's the only way I can remember, I don't remember this, it's too painful.
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.600]  If you hear my body right now, you know how hard it hurts.
[03:45.600 --> 03:49.360]  A memorial front has been set up in Clay Garten's name to benefit his three kids.
[03:49.360 --> 03:56.360]  For more information, call the Bank of America Wate Town Branch at 816-979-6292 and the family
[03:56.360 --> 04:01.440]  did have tissue samples taken from Clay Garten's body, hoping that they will lead to some concrete
[04:01.440 --> 04:02.440]  answers.
[04:02.440 --> 04:04.440]  Reporting live tonight, Ron Mott, NB.
[04:04.440 --> 04:07.680]  All right, now again, we really support the troops here.
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.720]  So we want the DU to stop being used, and we do support their family members, but you
[04:14.720 --> 04:17.840]  notice these neocons, they don't want to talk about it.
[04:17.840 --> 04:20.240]  They don't want to support these families, they don't even give treatment, and there
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.360]  is treatment to these soldiers when they're sick, they just deny it even exists.
[04:24.360 --> 04:29.400]  We have interviewed many times, he's coming on in about 15 minutes, Dr. Dunrocky, who literally
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.520]  wrote the book, The Training Manual, in the 80s on DU and is sick from it.
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.200]  Many of his team have died from it, from removing records from the first Gulf War.
[04:39.200 --> 04:45.000]  So the world expert will be joining us, and the government knows full well what it does,
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  and they don't care.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.680]  I know it was hard for you to hear that again, Dwayne Garten, father of an Army specialist,
[04:51.680 --> 04:57.440]  a medic, Clay Garten, who's gone home to be with the Lord, Dwayne, thank you for coming
[04:57.440 --> 04:58.440]  on with us.
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.440]  Thank you, sir.
[04:59.440 --> 05:02.720]  I appreciate it, because we've got to get word out.
[05:02.720 --> 05:05.400]  We've got to stop this.
[05:05.400 --> 05:10.000]  I know the administration don't really care, you can tell that by the way Romfield does
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.040]  things, and the way he answered the truth full aware about the armament on the vehicles.
[05:16.040 --> 05:22.560]  My son was a helicopter paramedic, 300 some odd missions over there in 16 months.
[05:22.560 --> 05:28.840]  He was called out one night, and there was an Army personnel carrier that had been hit
[05:28.840 --> 05:33.320]  with one of these bullets, and the corpsman that was in that unit was the one that was
[05:33.320 --> 05:41.440]  hit at the tore his arm off, and my son went inside the vehicle to stabilize him so they
[05:41.440 --> 05:43.400]  could transport him to the hospital.
[05:43.400 --> 05:44.400]  Let me stop you.
[05:44.400 --> 05:45.640]  This was a friendly fire incident?
[05:45.640 --> 05:49.480]  No, this was the enemy, but they had our weapons shell.
[05:49.480 --> 05:53.960]  Yeah, it's been reported, yeah, they've been shooting up the Abrams too, they've got it,
[05:53.960 --> 05:54.960]  yes.
[05:54.960 --> 05:59.480]  And he said they got him back to the hospital and had him there for a day, and then they
[05:59.480 --> 06:05.480]  shipped him to another place, and he died the day after that from his wounds to his
[06:05.480 --> 06:10.000]  arm, and probably the uranium that got into the system so quick that way.
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.600]  So your son was inside the vehicle that had been hit?
[06:12.600 --> 06:13.600]  Yes, sir.
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.800]  And again, it aerosolizes and turns into a fine microscopic counter?
[06:18.800 --> 06:19.880]  Right.
[06:19.880 --> 06:25.760]  You know, when he came home, we met him at Fort Bragg when he came off the plate, they
[06:25.760 --> 06:29.720]  held him over, he was supposed to get out in April of this year, and they kept him until
[06:29.720 --> 06:34.040]  October of this year, but they brought him home the last part of May or the first part
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.040]  of June.
[06:35.040 --> 06:38.800]  It's so confusing, I can't remember, but me and his mother go from here to Fort Bragg
[06:38.800 --> 06:46.280]  to meet him, and he was just as healthy and nice, and then he had the rest of his duty
[06:46.280 --> 06:53.240]  there, and he had some time saved up, so he took his leave just before the 1st of October
[06:53.240 --> 07:00.440]  because he had 50 days left, and he stayed here with us because his home and his stuff
[07:00.440 --> 07:09.600]  was not ready for him, and two days before he had this massive spasm in his muscles
[07:09.600 --> 07:17.880]  and everything, his furniture arrived two days after that, and we moved everything into
[07:17.880 --> 07:23.720]  the house, but he was not capable of staying there because he couldn't take care of himself.
[07:23.720 --> 07:29.840]  He's in December of the 70's, turn 35, and had to give him showers because he couldn't
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.600]  take care of himself, and we took him to the hospital seven times before they even admitted
[07:34.600 --> 07:39.080]  him, and we was up there every day.
[07:39.080 --> 07:40.080]  What's the VA, sir?
[07:40.080 --> 07:41.840]  Yes, sir, in Kansas City.
[07:41.840 --> 07:44.040]  The famous Kansas City VA.
[07:44.040 --> 07:49.920]  We call it the Oversized Morgue, where I don't mean to bring this up, but we have to do this
[07:49.920 --> 07:50.920]  to save other trips.
[07:50.920 --> 07:52.920]  You better believe it, sir.
[07:52.920 --> 07:59.800]  If I could save one out of any of them, the like doing this, I would do it in a minute.
[07:59.800 --> 08:06.720]  The main thing I was really concerned about is my three grandbabies, they're three, four,
[08:06.720 --> 08:11.360]  three, and two, and I've got to have a father.
[08:11.360 --> 08:17.320]  We had the memorial service last night for him, and they were there, and the littlest
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.320]  one, he's two.
[08:18.320 --> 08:26.320]  He kept pointing and saying, Daddy, Daddy, you know, he don't understand, but the way
[08:26.320 --> 08:36.120]  start men and women over there like this, just because some bureaucrat wants to get after
[08:36.120 --> 08:41.120]  somebody that threatened his father when he was in office, it's just not right.
[08:41.120 --> 08:44.280]  I mean, he's taken our defenses from here.
[08:44.280 --> 08:48.360]  He's taken all of our national guard, this which is supposed to be home security, home,
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.360]  you know.
[08:49.360 --> 08:53.360]  So what happens if they invade us with all of our troops everywhere else, and they're
[08:53.360 --> 08:55.120]  even killed over there?
[08:55.120 --> 09:00.240]  Let me just bring up that particular VA, because they didn't help your son, according to what
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.760]  you told me during the break when we first talked.
[09:04.760 --> 09:08.160]  Are you aware of the maggot deaths there in the hospital?
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.320]  Of the what?
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.200]  Were you aware that World War II and Korean war vets are strapped down in that VA and
[09:13.200 --> 09:15.000]  have died from maggots entering their brains?
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  Yes, sir.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.320]  But my son said, take him to the VA, so if you know.
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.320]  Well, I know, no, I mean, that's what I'm not, I'm not, I'm just saying, this is-
[09:22.320 --> 09:23.320]  Oh, I know, I see what you're saying.
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.320]  Yes, yes.
[09:24.320 --> 09:25.840]  This is what they think of our veterans.
[09:25.840 --> 09:26.840]  Right.
[09:26.840 --> 09:30.800]  They, they were supposed to have had a big shake up here and everything, and redone
[09:30.800 --> 09:37.960]  everything, and my son was in, in, they put him in a intensive care unit, where he had
[09:37.960 --> 09:43.480]  to put on a gown and a mask and everything to go in, and, and they didn't tell him that
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.680]  they'd had a fire in their electrical room, and the button on the bed didn't work, and
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.800]  he kept pressing the button for the nurse to come in and help him, and, and he was late
[09:51.800 --> 09:57.480]  in there 15 minutes, and then crapped all over himself before anybody came in, was about
[09:57.480 --> 09:58.880]  20 minutes after that.
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.680]  So, I mean, yeah, they don't care up there, they're sickening, and then after he passed
[10:04.680 --> 10:12.520]  away at 8.25, the day after Christmas, they came out and told us they was going to try
[10:12.520 --> 10:19.320]  CPR on him, and I said, you know, you've done lost him, don't, you know, don't do anything,
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.560]  just let, you know, leave him go, because he's gone, and I said, I appreciate it, if
[10:23.560 --> 10:27.280]  you remove all the tubes and everything, so then my wife can come in and see before you
[10:27.280 --> 10:33.120]  take him away, and they left us sit out there for an hour before they come out and got us
[10:33.120 --> 10:37.840]  to go in and see, and I had to go back here and ask him, was he radiant, and the nurse
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.960]  said, oh yeah, he's radiant, I said, why didn't you come tell us, you know, they're just so
[10:43.960 --> 10:50.760]  impersonal, and I, I wish the God had took him out of there and put him in another hospital.
[10:50.760 --> 10:56.360]  Well, again, we're going to talk about the Memorial Fund for the grandchildren when we
[10:56.360 --> 11:02.200]  get back, but your son, your son, during the break you told me, your son had told you
[11:02.200 --> 11:05.840]  that he believed it was the depleted uranium, and then we talked about a lot of other people
[11:05.840 --> 11:08.440]  have already died from this with the exact same symptoms.
[11:08.440 --> 11:15.360]  Yes, with the high fever and the muscles, and then the three that we heard about that
[11:15.360 --> 11:20.480]  died as soon as they innovated them, put the tube down their throat, they died, and that's
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.600]  exactly what happened to him, as soon as they put the tube down his throat was ventilated,
[11:26.600 --> 11:29.000]  and he died.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.600]  Unbelievable, and they know what DU does, they've known it since the 80s, and they still use
[11:36.600 --> 11:42.040]  it, and they don't care, and they're going to keep using it, and the people when I rock
[11:42.040 --> 11:49.680]  are going to be dying for millions of years from it, it never goes away.
[11:49.680 --> 11:50.680]  Stay there, Dwayne.

[13:55.760 --> 14:00.560]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.400]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the
[14:04.400 --> 14:05.400]  water.
[14:05.400 --> 14:06.400]  We listened.
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.040]  It's a elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[14:11.040 --> 14:12.040]  We listened.
[14:12.040 --> 14:15.360]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[14:15.360 --> 14:16.360]  We listened.
[14:16.360 --> 14:20.840]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[14:20.840 --> 14:21.840]  We listened.
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.320]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical
[14:26.320 --> 14:27.320]  agents.
[14:27.320 --> 14:29.040]  Again, we listened.
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.600]  Introducing the Merkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans
[14:34.600 --> 14:36.880]  and made in America.
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.840]  Get the Merkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling new millennium at
[14:42.840 --> 14:43.840]  888-803-4438.
[14:43.840 --> 14:55.800]  That's toll-free, triple-eight, 803-4438, not yet available in Iowa.
[14:55.800 --> 14:58.520]  Those dark depressing days are here.
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.160]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.280]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[15:06.280 --> 15:09.280]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.760]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[15:12.760 --> 15:14.240]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[15:14.240 --> 15:16.720]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[15:16.720 --> 15:18.240]  Check with your doctor.
[15:18.240 --> 15:23.560]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from sad, seasonal affective disorder.
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.920]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special
[15:27.920 --> 15:28.920]  lights.
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.160]  In light of your life, put some sunshine on your depressing days with a Northern light.
[15:33.160 --> 15:40.560]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives
[15:40.560 --> 15:43.960]  or visit us at NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[15:43.960 --> 15:46.560]  That's NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.560]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[15:50.560 --> 16:00.760]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[16:00.760 --> 16:03.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[16:03.760 --> 16:07.120]  I fell into a burning ray of light.
[16:07.120 --> 16:08.120]  I know it's hard.
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.120]  Down, down, down.
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.760]  For Mr. Garten, Dwayne Garten, father of Clay Garten to be on with us, he's great to stay
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.200]  on with Dr. Rocky coming up in the next segment.
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.160]  We're talking again during the break, Dwayne, and you were talking about friends that you
[16:24.160 --> 16:29.120]  have, the people who've come back who've lost 90 pounds.
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.120]  Tell us about that, just the people that you know and that you've talked to of the
[16:34.120 --> 16:35.120]  troops coming back.
[16:35.120 --> 16:36.480]  I have family over there.
[16:36.480 --> 16:38.800]  They're all terrified of it.
[16:38.800 --> 16:41.720]  They say they've been told to keep their mouths shut.
[16:41.720 --> 16:48.760]  Almost all the big Iraqi bases were bombed with this from the Warthogs and the F-18 Joint
[16:48.760 --> 16:51.520]  Strike fighters and the Abrams and the Bradleys.
[16:51.520 --> 16:57.800]  Our troops move into those bases and the government is so confident that we won't be able to stand
[16:57.800 --> 16:58.800]  up against them.
[16:58.800 --> 16:59.800]  They just do it.
[16:59.800 --> 17:02.120]  Can you comment on the people you've talked to who've also been sick and dying from this
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.680]  and then what you think should happen in Iraq, sir?
[17:04.680 --> 17:06.760]  Yes, I'd be glad to.
[17:06.760 --> 17:13.240]  My daughter has a friend who, a friend of hers was a mother and daughter that were over
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.240]  there.
[17:14.240 --> 17:24.160]  My daughter came back and within, I think they said within 34 days she lost 90 pounds
[17:24.160 --> 17:28.480]  and they don't expect her to live either.
[17:28.480 --> 17:36.400]  My son lost 30 pounds in 17 days in the hospital.
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.720]  So this has got to be something that they know.
[17:40.720 --> 17:46.000]  I know even after they do this autopsy, they will not give me concrete evidence of what
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.800]  killed him.
[17:47.800 --> 17:49.400]  And you know it as well as I do.
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.000]  Well, I would advise you, sir, to take multiple blood samples, tissue samples and send it
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  to multiple labs.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.520]  It's a little late now.
[17:56.520 --> 18:08.760]  We're going to put him very in Monday and they've already involved him, so it's a little
[18:08.760 --> 18:13.040]  late for some of the things, but they took all these tissue samples that you're talking
[18:13.040 --> 18:17.840]  about and they were going to send them out and do an autopsy and it'll always be six
[18:17.840 --> 18:20.320]  weeks before we would know any of the results.
[18:20.320 --> 18:21.320]  Where are they?
[18:21.320 --> 18:22.320]  Who is they?
[18:22.320 --> 18:23.320]  Where are they sending it?
[18:23.320 --> 18:29.120]  That KU Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas are the ones that took the tissue sample.
[18:29.120 --> 18:34.440]  They took the body from the VA hospital over to KU.
[18:34.440 --> 18:37.640]  Did you independently get this group or do they recommend them?
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.360]  KU doctors run the VA hospital here.
[18:43.360 --> 18:49.440]  Oh, let me just tell you, the New York Daily News earlier this year tested the blood of
[18:49.440 --> 18:50.440]  14 troops.
[18:50.440 --> 18:55.320]  They all had DU in them and upwards of two rims of radiation, but we caught the government
[18:55.320 --> 18:56.320]  in the past.
[18:56.320 --> 19:00.040]  I don't know about this group, falsifying stuff, so I would definitely look out.
[19:00.040 --> 19:01.040]  Yeah.
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.280]  And you know, how long did it take them to come up with the Asian orange that was killing
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.840]  our troops and the other one in the desert storm was killing our troops.
[19:10.840 --> 19:15.080]  And now we got another thing killing our troops and they're not telling us.
[19:15.080 --> 19:19.000]  They admit chemical weapons exposure from blowing up chemistry.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  Yes.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  Yeah.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Yeah.
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.600]  But you know, my son was working, at one time he was working in an air base there in
[19:29.600 --> 19:38.120]  Iraq escorting 12 Iraqi workers to rebuild this hangar and he said that they were cleaning
[19:38.120 --> 19:44.640]  it out and there was canisters of everything in the storage rooms and everything and nobody
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.680]  knows what was in them and they would just carry them out and, you know, getting rid
[19:48.680 --> 19:49.680]  of them.
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.960]  So, you know, he could have, he can be exposed something there, but if it's a germ warfare
[19:53.960 --> 19:57.240]  or the way I understand what you're wearing for when I was in the service, it'll happen
[19:57.240 --> 19:58.240]  pretty quick.
[19:58.240 --> 19:59.960]  Why would they want you to live six months?
[19:59.960 --> 20:02.120]  They want to get rid of you now because you're fighting them.
[20:02.120 --> 20:06.560]  No, what happened to your son, Fitch, the MO that I learned of eight, nine years ago
[20:06.560 --> 20:07.560]  with DU?
[20:07.560 --> 20:08.560]  Yeah.
[20:08.560 --> 20:16.480]  Well, that's exactly what I think it was because it, he was healthy up until the first
[20:16.480 --> 20:17.480]  of December.
[20:17.480 --> 20:20.000]  I mean, he's been back since May, you know.
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.200]  Well, sir, you own those tissue samples.
[20:22.200 --> 20:26.680]  I would demand, I mean, this is my advice, because you should swim over this.
[20:26.680 --> 20:30.760]  I would demand those samples back if this is a VA contracted group and I'd have an independent
[20:30.760 --> 20:33.400]  lab do it like the New York Daily News did.
[20:33.400 --> 20:34.400]  I think you're right.
[20:34.400 --> 20:35.400]  I don't think I'll do that.
[20:35.400 --> 20:38.960]  I just show up there, I get a court order without them even knowing.
[20:38.960 --> 20:44.320]  We're still know right now we're on in Kansas City and I just, I'd get those samples back,
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.320]  sir.
[20:45.320 --> 20:46.320]  Yeah.
[20:46.320 --> 20:51.000]  If they haven't already got rid of, I mean, I don't, I know what you're saying.
[20:51.000 --> 20:52.000]  Yeah.
[20:52.000 --> 20:53.000]  I'm not imputing this group, I don't know.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.080]  I'm just saying if they're VA involved with the past stuff we've seen.
[20:57.080 --> 21:03.760]  Well all their resident doctors, resident at the VA hospital over there and all their
[21:03.760 --> 21:05.680]  main staff is from KU.
[21:05.680 --> 21:06.680]  Oh boy.
[21:06.680 --> 21:07.680]  Oh.
[21:07.680 --> 21:10.000]  I mean, they're connected very tightly with the government and then the government
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.280]  tells them, you keep your mouth shut, they're going to keep their mouth shut because they
[21:13.280 --> 21:14.520]  got a contract there.
[21:14.520 --> 21:15.520]  Yeah.
[21:15.520 --> 21:18.920]  I would, it's sad we've all got to think like this, but we do.
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.000]  You were saying during the break, you think we should pull everybody out of our rack?
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  Yeah.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  Definitely.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  The quicker, the better.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.280]  They've been fighting for 2,000 years there and as soon as we pull out of there, even
[21:30.280 --> 21:35.040]  after this election that he's so great about, they'll come in there and take it back away
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.040]  from him.
[21:36.040 --> 21:38.280]  Just like Solomon Sain did.
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.280]  We got a, we got a break.
[21:39.280 --> 21:40.880]  He can't stop that kind of stuff over there.
[21:40.880 --> 21:41.880]  You're right.
[21:41.880 --> 21:42.880]  Well, they're right back.
[21:42.880 --> 21:51.880]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[21:51.880 --> 22:01.280]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness
[22:01.280 --> 22:03.520]  therapies are within your reach?
[22:03.520 --> 22:07.720]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Reif frequency technology.
[22:07.720 --> 22:12.760]  In the 1920s, research scientist, Royal Raymond Reif discovered that disease organisms can
[22:12.760 --> 22:15.120]  be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.640]  The biosolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination
[22:19.640 --> 22:23.120]  of pain and disease conditions, there are no side effects.
[22:23.120 --> 22:26.400]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[22:26.400 --> 22:27.400]  Eliminate the cause.
[22:27.400 --> 22:28.600]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[22:28.600 --> 22:34.240]  Biosolutions has over 453 programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.920]  is very easy to use.
[22:35.920 --> 22:39.760]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[22:39.760 --> 22:49.560]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625, 866-885-6625, 866-885-6625,
[22:49.560 --> 22:54.840]  one more time that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[22:54.840 --> 22:59.640]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table
[22:59.640 --> 23:01.320]  by raising the spigot level.
[23:01.320 --> 23:06.920]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED
[23:06.920 --> 23:07.920]  lamps.
[23:07.920 --> 23:12.920]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and
[23:12.920 --> 23:16.360]  are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[23:16.360 --> 23:21.360]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.760]  will operate them all night long.
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.720]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[23:28.720 --> 23:34.360]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[23:34.360 --> 23:38.000]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight or night light.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.400]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125
[23:44.400 --> 23:55.080]  by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438, that's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[23:55.080 --> 23:58.640]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful that the food
[23:58.640 --> 23:59.640]  was so great.
[23:59.640 --> 24:04.200]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and is incorporated these ideals into a website
[24:04.200 --> 24:07.120]  that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[24:07.120 --> 24:10.720]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you,
[24:10.720 --> 24:14.000]  realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.640]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and
[24:17.640 --> 24:21.920]  your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[24:21.920 --> 24:25.440]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively
[24:25.440 --> 24:28.600]  our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[24:28.600 --> 24:31.640]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom, how the runaway
[24:31.640 --> 24:35.680]  government is crushing the American dream, why wars are played out across the globe,
[24:35.680 --> 24:37.960]  the fractional reserve system, etc.
[24:37.960 --> 24:41.120]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[24:41.120 --> 24:47.280]  Which is power, feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[24:47.280 --> 24:49.400]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[24:49.400 --> 24:56.240]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[24:56.240 --> 25:02.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[25:02.600 --> 25:04.600]  a war on for your mind.
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.920]  Alright, we just played this clip about 15 minutes ago, but I'm going to play it one
[25:08.920 --> 25:13.520]  more time, last time we're going to air this, this is a local NBC news piece, it's pretty
[25:13.520 --> 25:17.000]  fair, you'll never see something like this on the national news, though it has slipped
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.520]  out that D.U. is deadly, but we've now learned more details from Army Sergeant Clay Gartin
[25:25.520 --> 25:29.680]  who died after 16 months in Iraq and came back and died.
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.400]  We're going to air this one more time and at the end it has the phone number, the Bank
[25:33.400 --> 25:38.360]  of America to give some donations to help the widower and the three grandchildren because
[25:38.360 --> 25:40.080]  we really support the troops here.
[25:40.080 --> 25:43.840]  We're going to air this so Dr. Rocky is brought up to speed on this particular case, then
[25:43.840 --> 25:49.520]  we're going to have Dr. Rocky and DeWayne Gartin, the father of Army Specialist Clay
[25:49.520 --> 25:52.400]  Gartin, on together.
[25:52.400 --> 25:56.320]  But one more time, here is this little NBC news piece.
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.040]  A soldier survives Iraq but dies of a mysterious illness his family suspects the government
[26:02.040 --> 26:03.040]  is hiding.
[26:03.040 --> 26:06.920]  And if the Action News reporter Ron Mott is live with the story you'll see only on NBC
[26:06.920 --> 26:07.920]  Action News.
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.720]  Elizabeth, it's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned
[26:12.720 --> 26:13.720]  by their own ammo.
[26:13.720 --> 26:17.800]  They, of course, are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned
[26:17.800 --> 26:20.320]  into unfriendly fire.
[26:20.320 --> 26:28.040]  You know, they come out five minutes, said he's gone.
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.080]  For nearly a year and a half, DeWayne Gartin worried that his son might return from Iraq
[26:32.080 --> 26:33.080]  in a body bag.
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.000]  And this is worse than they could have got killed, though we were really.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.320]  That decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Gartin spent an agonizing three weeks dying
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.440]  in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the
[26:45.440 --> 26:46.840]  day after Christmas.
[26:46.840 --> 26:54.280]  Thirty-five years, I had the boy, he went two, three months of hell and they come back and
[26:54.280 --> 26:56.000]  they didn't do nothing for him.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.600]  That's what I don't understand why they couldn't do something for him.
[27:00.600 --> 27:03.600]  This is Seth and this is Mr. Gage.
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.920]  A father of three, Clay Gartin's family believes the Army medic has every bit of casualty of
[27:07.920 --> 27:12.880]  war as those who die on the front lines after they say he became exposed to depleted uranium
[27:12.880 --> 27:15.320]  dust used in some U.S. ammunition.
[27:15.320 --> 27:17.720]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.640]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[27:21.640 --> 27:25.680]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.520]  The family says Gartin lost 30 pounds before he died, starting with a debilitating backspasm
[27:30.520 --> 27:36.160]  earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[27:36.160 --> 27:45.840]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big, strong, intelligent man to turn into a small
[27:45.840 --> 27:46.840]  person.
[27:46.840 --> 27:52.080]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[27:52.080 --> 27:54.320]  That's the only way I can remember.
[27:54.320 --> 27:55.800]  I don't remember this.
[27:55.800 --> 27:57.800]  It's too painful.
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.520]  If you're in my body right now, you know how hard it hurts.
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.960]  A memorial fund has been set up in Clay Gartin's name to benefit his three kids.
[28:06.960 --> 28:13.920]  For more information, call the Bank of America Raitown Branch at 816-979-6292, and the family
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.000]  did have tissue samples taken from Clay Gartin's body hoping that they will lead to some concrete
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  answers.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  Reporting live tonight, Ron Mott.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.520]  I talked to Dr. Rocky during the break.
[28:23.520 --> 28:27.400]  We're about to go to him and Mr. Gartin.
[28:27.400 --> 28:34.200]  He said, definitely, get those samples back until it turns into something where they say,
[28:34.200 --> 28:37.880]  oh, false positive, and then you don't want to exhume or anything.
[28:37.880 --> 28:43.840]  Again, New York Daily News and others did blood test on troops from massive levels of radiation,
[28:43.840 --> 28:51.040]  upwards of two rims, the heavy metal effects, all of it, and understand, folks, I have copies
[28:51.040 --> 28:53.840]  of the Army manual that Dr. Rocky helped write.
[28:53.840 --> 29:00.840]  I've seen online hours of the seven-hour training video they're supposed to watch.
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.080]  This was to be a frontline weapon to fight the Soviet Union.
[29:04.080 --> 29:09.560]  They poured across Europe with their six-to-one superiority of armor.
[29:09.560 --> 29:15.600]  This was to be a frontline emergency weapon during a nuclear war to just go ahead and
[29:15.600 --> 29:16.720]  knock out their tanks.
[29:16.720 --> 29:22.920]  Instead, they've used it in the First Gulf War, Second Gulf War, Serbia, from Kosovo
[29:22.920 --> 29:25.760]  to Belgrade, and, of course, an Afghanistan.
[29:25.760 --> 29:32.040]  This is nuclear war, and it doesn't go away for hundreds of millions of years, basically
[29:32.040 --> 29:34.200]  forever, as far as humanity's concerned.
[29:34.200 --> 29:36.720]  I mean, they may have salted the earth.
[29:36.720 --> 29:39.400]  The Romans used to salt the earth to punish people.
[29:39.400 --> 29:41.480]  Now they salt it with D.U.
[29:41.480 --> 29:44.920]  Dr. Rocky helped write the book on this stuff.
[29:44.920 --> 29:47.880]  He went over there to study it, help remove damaged vehicles.
[29:47.880 --> 29:50.800]  The First Gulf War, he's been very ill, a lot of his team has died.
[29:50.800 --> 29:56.200]  Just to fill you in on this, and why does Donald Rumsfeld and this government, Bill
[29:56.200 --> 29:59.320]  Clinton, all of them, they don't care.
[29:59.320 --> 30:03.320]  To examine this psychology and to go over the facts with us is Dr. Rocky.
[30:03.320 --> 30:11.200]  Dr. Rocky, just in a nutshell, tell us your incredible bio, and then what D.U. is, and
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.840]  what the effects are, what the science is, what the Pentagon's own manual show, and then
[30:15.840 --> 30:21.480]  I want to get into the psychology of why they're using it and don't care, and then we'll be
[30:21.480 --> 30:25.920]  talking in a minute or so here to Mr. Garten, the father of Clay Garten.
[30:25.920 --> 30:27.440]  Dr. Rocky, thanks for joining us.
[30:27.440 --> 30:28.440]  Thank you.
[30:28.440 --> 30:32.440]  First, my condolences to the father of the family.
[30:32.440 --> 30:37.200]  Another warrior has fallen and is totally unnecessary and unacceptable.
[30:37.200 --> 30:43.400]  My background in the military goes back to 1967, Vietnam time, two years over there in
[30:43.400 --> 30:49.040]  that area, and going through, coming back in as a combat medic, three years in the infantry,
[30:49.040 --> 30:53.040]  and moving on up through the ranks, starting out from the enlisted and going up through
[30:53.040 --> 30:57.240]  the officer ranks, so I've held all the ranks in different positions in the military.
[30:57.240 --> 31:02.600]  When Gulf War I started, my expertise and my team's expertise, and I'm just a member
[31:02.600 --> 31:08.000]  of the team, we were under senior colonels that, again, were the leaders of our team.
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.960]  Our expertise was nuclear, biological, chemical warfare, preventive medicine, hazardous materials,
[31:13.960 --> 31:17.440]  and then, obviously, with the completion of the ground war, we got tossed into the whole
[31:17.440 --> 31:25.200]  defeated uranium mess in March and late February at the ground war, February, March of 1991.
[31:25.200 --> 31:29.960]  General Schwarzkopf specifically assigned me, as he was ordered by the Pentagon, to
[31:29.960 --> 31:34.320]  go out and clean up the DU mess, and since it's been a nightmare.
[31:34.320 --> 31:36.320]  Highway of hell in other areas.
[31:36.320 --> 31:37.320]  Yeah.
[31:37.320 --> 31:41.880]  Well, let's go back, though, because before that, you actually worked at the laboratories
[31:41.880 --> 31:43.880]  you studied, DU, correct?
[31:43.880 --> 31:48.240]  Well, no, I basically didn't know a whole lot about DU other than my background in physics
[31:48.240 --> 31:52.080]  and everything else, and at the time this all started, I was in high-energy physics
[31:52.080 --> 31:53.080]  at the University of Illinois.
[31:53.080 --> 31:55.400]  When did you write the reports on DU?
[31:55.400 --> 31:59.400]  Well, we wrote the reports on DU once we got up there and started cleaning up the mess
[31:59.400 --> 32:04.000]  and finding out the problems, and all of us started getting sick within 24 to 72 hours.
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.520]  We went up there and found people sick, we started getting sick, and our first cancers
[32:07.520 --> 32:12.280]  and our team started within nine months, the first cancer deaths within two years, and
[32:12.280 --> 32:14.680]  all the other health effects started showing up.
[32:14.680 --> 32:17.800]  The thing that's important about this, and this is one of the things that I've been yelling
[32:17.800 --> 32:21.280]  and screaming, and the rest of our team has been yelling and screaming at the top of our
[32:21.280 --> 32:26.400]  lungs, you need to understand, we're all medical senior scientist, Army professionals.
[32:26.400 --> 32:32.280]  We're Army leaders that became persona non-gratin when we spoke about this stuff.
[32:32.280 --> 32:37.720]  What happened in Gulf War I, and what we're seeing the same in Gulf War II, is not only
[32:37.720 --> 32:41.240]  do we have all the uranium contamination, but we destroyed a nation that released all
[32:41.240 --> 32:47.240]  the toxic industrial chemicals that are used in agriculture, industry, medicine, and education.
[32:47.240 --> 32:51.600]  We sent the troops in there without the adequate training, without the adequate equipment.
[32:51.600 --> 32:55.880]  I mean, the United States General Accounting Office confirmed before the report that the
[32:55.880 --> 32:59.400]  gas masks in the Mopsuits ever issued, the troops were defective and faulty.
[32:59.400 --> 33:02.840]  That's an absolute simple fact of life.
[33:02.840 --> 33:05.440]  The kids did not know how to use this stuff.
[33:05.440 --> 33:09.520]  They were not given the training that's mandated, and I think it's an important understanding
[33:09.520 --> 33:12.720]  of the DU training that I put together for the Army.
[33:12.720 --> 33:20.120]  Yeah, let's go back over that, and then even previous to that, the Pentagon and the Lawrence
[33:20.120 --> 33:24.960]  Livermore Laboratories and others, they had admitted that DU was really bad, but they
[33:24.960 --> 33:25.960]  kept this quiet.
[33:25.960 --> 33:27.600]  Can you talk about that a little bit?
[33:27.600 --> 33:32.680]  Yeah, I mean, we can go back as far as the reports that were compiled after we gave it
[33:32.680 --> 33:38.400]  to Israel to use it against the Egyptians in the Sinai in 73 and 74.
[33:38.400 --> 33:40.960]  That confirmed all the health effects and the environmental problems.
[33:40.960 --> 33:46.840]  The work that we put together coming back when I got what's called the infamous Groves
[33:46.840 --> 33:52.160]  memorandum goes back to 1943, and we've talked to individuals that were present, were involved
[33:52.160 --> 33:55.880]  in writing this stuff, that the uranium was going to cause all these health effects once
[33:55.880 --> 33:58.800]  it's inhaled, adjusted, or get into the body.
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.440]  When you combine the uranium contamination from the use of the weapons, plus all of the
[34:03.440 --> 34:09.240]  other contaminants for more, you've got an absolute toxic nightmare, and that's why,
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.520]  and according to the US Department of Veteran Affairs, they're totally acknowledging that
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.600]  of all individuals served in the Persian Gulf from, say, August of 1990 and the latest reports
[34:19.600 --> 34:26.160]  I got are May of this year, this last year, but yeah, we're still in before, aren't we?
[34:26.160 --> 34:31.040]  We're looking at well over 260,000 for our sons and daughters.
[34:31.040 --> 34:34.440]  That's over 30% of the forces that are already been labeled disabled.
[34:34.440 --> 34:37.400]  We're seeing neurological problems, we're seeing respiratory problems, we're seeing
[34:37.400 --> 34:40.840]  cancer, we've got malignments, we've got non-malignant tumors.
[34:40.840 --> 34:45.640]  We have all the neurological symptoms, we have the whole host of all of this stuff that's
[34:45.640 --> 34:46.640]  put together.
[34:46.640 --> 34:51.280]  And then earlier this year, the New York paper went and did blood tests, and wow, they had
[34:51.280 --> 34:52.800]  high levels of DU in them.
[34:52.800 --> 34:57.640]  Well, absolutely, and that's members of the 442nd New York National Guard.
[34:57.640 --> 35:01.280]  You have to understand, these were the heroes of 9-1-1.
[35:01.280 --> 35:07.960]  These are the police and firemen that survived that tragedy on that day, were put on active
[35:07.960 --> 35:14.360]  duty and sent to war with defective equipment, with totally inadequate training, into a contaminated
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.200]  area where the leaders had not complied with the U.S. Army regulations, they had not complied
[35:19.200 --> 35:20.200]  with the borders.
[35:20.200 --> 35:21.200]  Now, there's no debate.
[35:21.200 --> 35:24.760]  They've tested their blood, they all had incredibly high levels, you have the radiation
[35:24.760 --> 35:28.480]  problem, you have the heavy metal problem, as we talked last time, doctor, and the point
[35:28.480 --> 35:33.640]  I want to make here is, we used a lot more DU this time than last time, can you speak
[35:33.640 --> 35:34.640]  to that?
[35:34.640 --> 35:35.640]  Then I want to go to Mr. Garten.
[35:35.640 --> 35:41.040]  Yeah, we're looking at the estimates during Gulf War I, we probably used 375 tons, and
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.880]  I mean 375 tons of solid uranium, not 375 tons of munitions contained in everything,
[35:47.880 --> 35:54.200]  but 375 tons of comprised of solid uranium, and in this time, we're looking in Iraq and
[35:54.200 --> 35:59.920]  Gulf War II, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, the only freedom here is the freedom to get polluted
[35:59.920 --> 36:06.920]  and die, but probably over 1,000 tons, so we're looking at three times the amount, and
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.400]  the thing that's disturbing me most, the United States Army Surgeon General, General Ronald
[36:12.400 --> 36:17.560]  Peake, specifically ordered, and again, he's reiterating all the orders we go back to my
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.280]  original one right after the ground war in 1991, to provide immediate radio bio-assays,
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.040]  immediate medical care for all individuals who have been exposed.
[36:26.040 --> 36:31.280]  In the case of 442nd, the U.S. Army absolutely refused to comply with the existing orders,
[36:31.280 --> 36:36.880]  forcing the individuals at the New York Daily News to take it upon themselves, acquire the
[36:36.880 --> 36:41.920]  funding to set up the testing, so that order requiring medical care for all of our sons
[36:41.920 --> 36:44.040]  and daughters is absolutely not being complied with.
[36:44.040 --> 36:49.720]  Okay, let me bring Mr. Garten on, father of Clay Garten, 36-year-old, who came back and
[36:49.720 --> 36:56.280]  died within a month once he got sick, and they basically didn't give him any treatment
[36:56.280 --> 36:58.560]  and kept denying that the DU was involved.
[36:58.560 --> 37:02.480]  Now, they took samples and gave it to the university medical system that they basically
[37:02.480 --> 37:08.480]  control, and Mr. Garten, tell him about the sampling that took place, so Dr. Rocky can
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.120]  try to give you some advice on that.
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.880]  After his death, they wanted to do an autopsy, and I told them they weren't going to do a
[37:18.880 --> 37:23.480]  massive autopsy and cut my son up any worse than they came any worse than they was, and
[37:23.480 --> 37:30.200]  then they came back later and asked if they could do tissue samples without doing any big
[37:30.200 --> 37:31.200]  cutting of the body.
[37:31.200 --> 37:33.440]  And that way they could absolve, but go ahead.
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.080]  Right, they can take little small tissue samples by drilling a little hole in the head and
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.640]  taking the samples and the lungs and the liver and the heart and all that stuff.
[37:42.640 --> 37:48.040]  And then they said that they were going to take these samples over to KU and then send
[37:48.040 --> 37:54.960]  them out and get these tests done on them, and then we would know in six weeks what the
[37:54.960 --> 37:55.960]  problem was.
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.280]  And then again, tell folks the relationship between KU and the VA there.
[37:59.280 --> 38:06.000]  Well, the VA, all the interns are members of KU Medical Center, and all the head doctors
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.800]  over there are from KU Medical Center that worked there like once a week or something
[38:10.800 --> 38:13.160]  like that or once a month.
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.640]  And it's all run by KU, the Veterans Hospital, is more or less.
[38:18.640 --> 38:25.640]  And they went and done a bone marrow tap on my son in the last week they was there.
[38:25.640 --> 38:31.800]  And they came back, they said, no, he don't have no uranium poisoning at all as it shows
[38:31.800 --> 38:32.800]  as arthritis.
[38:32.800 --> 38:36.280]  But to me, I don't think they was telling us the truth.
[38:36.280 --> 38:40.040]  Well, I mean, they said that these National Guard in New York didn't have it, and then
[38:40.040 --> 38:42.880]  boom, New York Daily News did it, and they had massive levels.
[38:42.880 --> 38:45.440]  Dr. Rocky, what would you do about this?
[38:45.440 --> 38:46.440]  You got a mess.
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.920]  I mean, first off, sir, you know, my condolences to you and your family.
[38:50.920 --> 38:51.920]  Thank you very much.
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.840]  And, you know, warriors have been sent to war with defective equipment and adequate
[38:55.840 --> 39:01.200]  training and totally lack of medical support ever since I came into military in 1967.
[39:01.200 --> 39:04.920]  I was in there in the 50s, I was in the United States Navy.
[39:04.920 --> 39:11.640]  Well, my father was also in the Navy, and I, yeah, any household families come both ways.
[39:11.640 --> 39:18.480]  The first off, for the exposure to depleted uranium in these other toxins, with DU they
[39:18.480 --> 39:22.640]  needed to do what's called a radio bioassay, and that's where they collect the urine of
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.800]  PC samples and do nasal and pharyngeal swab to determine what the exposures are.
[39:26.800 --> 39:30.240]  That's supposed to happen within 24 to 72 hours of the year exposure.
[39:30.240 --> 39:32.240]  Well, I think they did get that, then.
[39:32.240 --> 39:33.240]  Well, obviously not.
[39:33.240 --> 39:34.240]  They're not going to comply.
[39:34.240 --> 39:37.760]  That is the written orders, but they are absolutely refusing to comply with that, not only for
[39:37.760 --> 39:41.880]  our own sons and daughters, but for also everybody else's exposure.
[39:41.880 --> 39:46.600]  And that's Iraqi children, Afghan children, the Balkan children, and it goes all over
[39:46.600 --> 39:48.840]  the United States, whether it's Concord and Massachusetts.
[39:48.840 --> 39:51.040]  Yeah, 10 different testing grounds, correct?
[39:51.040 --> 39:53.080]  Yeah, a whole bunch of different places.
[39:53.080 --> 39:55.080]  It's an absolute disaster.
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.000]  And so when they do the tissue samples, now they did the tissue sample biopsy on me, and
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.080]  I still got the scar in my arm, and I'm looking at it right now.
[40:02.080 --> 40:03.080]  Totally useless.
[40:03.080 --> 40:04.080]  Okay?
[40:04.080 --> 40:05.080]  Yeah.
[40:05.080 --> 40:07.080]  I mean, they're blowing smoke.
[40:07.080 --> 40:08.080]  I mean...
[40:08.080 --> 40:13.720]  That's what I, you know, I said, should I take him somewhere else?
[40:13.720 --> 40:16.720]  Should I take him to another hospital?
[40:16.720 --> 40:17.720]  Oh, no.
[40:17.720 --> 40:18.720]  You know?
[40:18.720 --> 40:22.600]  They said, you know, it's no matter where you take them, do the same tests we are.
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.560]  They said, we've run every test culture that they have any disease in Iraq, but it ain't
[40:28.560 --> 40:29.560]  a disease.
[40:29.560 --> 40:30.560]  Not a disease.
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.560]  Huh?
[40:31.560 --> 40:32.560]  It's not a disease.
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.560]  That's right.
[40:33.560 --> 40:39.840]  What we're looking at is, and this is one of the things we've been arguing about for
[40:39.840 --> 40:44.560]  so long, war has become a toxic wasteland.
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.600]  We absolutely use the uranium emissions, and they are an illegal weapon according to the
[40:48.600 --> 40:49.600]  United Nations.
[40:49.600 --> 40:54.080]  And when you look at the criteria, I mean, the common task training for the U.S. soldiers,
[40:54.080 --> 40:59.680]  and again, I wrote this, very simply requires full respiratory skin protection immediately
[40:59.680 --> 41:02.120]  upon exposure.
[41:02.120 --> 41:03.640]  It requires immediate medical care.
[41:03.640 --> 41:04.880]  Yeah, that's the book you wrote.
[41:04.880 --> 41:05.880]  Tell us about that.
[41:05.880 --> 41:06.960]  Yeah, well, there's a whole bunch of stuff.
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.480]  Let me finish, and then it also states specifically that the uranium contaminations can make food
[41:11.480 --> 41:12.480]  and water unusable.
[41:12.480 --> 41:14.240]  So we've got all of this stuff.
[41:14.240 --> 41:17.200]  Now, what happened, and I understand your son was a medic, sir?
[41:17.200 --> 41:18.200]  Yes, he was a medic.
[41:18.200 --> 41:19.680]  He was a helicopter corpsman.
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.040]  He was inside an armored vehicle that had been hit by DU shells.
[41:24.040 --> 41:25.040]  Runway fire.
[41:25.040 --> 41:29.800]  Well, no, it was enemy fire, but they had lines all over it.
[41:29.800 --> 41:35.520]  He went inside of it to take care of the gentleman that got his arm blew off by it.
[41:35.520 --> 41:40.240]  I'm sure you know, Dr. Rocky, that the Iraqis have got DU, they've been shooting the Abrams
[41:40.240 --> 41:41.240]  up with it.
[41:41.240 --> 41:44.120]  Oh, no, first off, the Iraqis had never had DU.
[41:44.120 --> 41:48.760]  The United States and Great Britain and Australia and Canada are the only ones that have it.
[41:48.760 --> 41:51.800]  But it's been reported that someone's shooting through the Abrams with DU.
[41:51.800 --> 41:52.800]  Well, absolutely.
[41:52.800 --> 41:53.800]  We are.
[41:53.800 --> 41:57.120]  Well, they shot through this armored personnel carrier, and it wasn't friendly fire.
[41:57.120 --> 41:59.000]  It wasn't friendly fire.
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.760]  He believes his son believed, correct, Mr. Garten, that they had captured weapons?
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.560]  From what he said, the attack on this column and when they shot this shell through there
[42:10.560 --> 42:12.040]  was from Iraqis.
[42:12.040 --> 42:16.600]  Now, the only thing that's going to happen is the U.S. has been shooting up everything
[42:16.600 --> 42:20.840]  and everything that moves, whether it's building a water treatment facility, whether it's food
[42:20.840 --> 42:22.120]  storage or it's our own.
[42:22.120 --> 42:28.000]  I mean, we have an Abrams tank that was lost in August 28th, you know, over a year ago.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.640]  That was all friendly fire from 50 cal.
[42:30.640 --> 42:35.760]  So what we have is the U.S. shooting everything that moves with uranium emissions as a consequence
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.600]  the medics have to go and provide care or take care of the people that come out and they're
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.360]  not having adequate respiratory skin protection and once they're exposed, they're not providing
[42:43.360 --> 42:46.720]  them the immediate medical care or the testing that are needed to confirm this.
[42:46.720 --> 42:48.920]  Stay there, Dr. Rocky and Mr. Garten.
[42:48.920 --> 42:50.160]  We'll talk about this when we get back.
[42:50.160 --> 42:52.160]  It's very, very important.
[42:52.160 --> 43:04.160]  Mass poisoning with D.U.
[43:04.160 --> 43:11.560]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[43:11.560 --> 43:15.880]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of ever-missponsored terrorism worldwide.
[43:15.880 --> 43:22.880]  It's a big rep for Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece and reveal
[43:22.880 --> 43:25.880]  the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[43:25.880 --> 43:26.880]  You will lose your liberty.
[43:26.880 --> 43:29.880]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.880]  Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run
[43:33.880 --> 43:35.880]  white slavery rings and much, much more.
[43:35.880 --> 43:39.880]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour
[43:39.880 --> 43:41.880]  video, Police State 3, is for you.
[43:41.880 --> 44:00.000]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.040]  Berkey Lite LED system.
[44:02.040 --> 44:08.080]  The Berkeys LED lamps are unique because incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years
[44:08.080 --> 44:13.120]  of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark
[44:13.120 --> 44:15.400]  yet require very little energy.
[44:15.400 --> 44:20.360]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny
[44:20.360 --> 44:26.360]  because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on
[44:26.360 --> 44:29.840]  a single set of four AA outgoing batteries.
[44:29.840 --> 44:30.840]  That's right.
[44:30.840 --> 44:35.320]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price
[44:35.320 --> 44:37.800]  of four small AA batteries.
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.720]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with
[44:42.720 --> 44:50.360]  on-off switch for only $10 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.
[44:50.360 --> 44:56.200]  That's toll-free, triple-eight, 803-4438.

[45:44.240 --> 45:50.080]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives, and education.
[45:50.080 --> 46:06.520]  Bottom line, they know to you as deadly, both as a heavy metal and with a radiation, and
[46:06.520 --> 46:13.040]  a thousand times, three times what was used in the First Gulf War, these masses of it
[46:13.040 --> 46:19.080]  in Serbia as well and Afghanistan, doesn't go away for hundreds of millions of years.
[46:19.080 --> 46:20.080]  That's just the half-line.
[46:20.080 --> 46:23.840]  Dr. Rocky is going to be with us into the next hour.
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.280]  We have had Mr. Garton on Weathers, and he's welcome to keep riding the shotgun with us.
[46:28.280 --> 46:33.480]  If you'd like to, I want to give out the number for the Memorial Fund to help out Mr. Garton's
[46:33.480 --> 46:43.440]  children, play Garton who died, but Dr. Rocky, I wanted to bring this point up to you.
[46:43.440 --> 46:49.520]  They admit that most of the Republican Guard and Iraqi regular Army bases got bombed with
[46:49.520 --> 46:50.520]  DU.
[46:50.520 --> 46:54.120]  Then our troops moved right into those bases, and at a few bases they brought in dump trucks
[46:54.120 --> 46:56.840]  with sand to dump it over the blast points.
[46:56.840 --> 47:01.080]  Does that protect our troops dumping some sand on the DU?
[47:01.080 --> 47:02.080]  Absolutely not.
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.440]  It's not confined whatsoever with the existing regulations.
[47:06.440 --> 47:10.440]  U.S. Army Regulation, I understand you've got a link to it on your website.
[47:10.440 --> 47:12.440]  Yes, at infowars.com.
[47:12.440 --> 47:13.440]  Okay?
[47:13.440 --> 47:27.120]  Very specifically, requires that the U.S. Army identify, isolate, secure, and clean up
[47:27.120 --> 47:28.440]  all of this contamination.
[47:28.440 --> 47:35.120]  I mean, it's not a question, it's not a debate, it's not a discussion.
[47:35.120 --> 47:41.360]  The order was signed by General Erich and Secchi, mandating this compliance, and again
[47:41.360 --> 47:43.040]  they just simply refuse.
[47:43.040 --> 47:45.240]  Let me add something else to this.
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.600]  The Abrams uses DU in its armor.
[47:47.600 --> 47:54.160]  I've also read that even when people use non-DU weapons against the Abrams, it puts off DU.
[47:54.160 --> 47:55.160]  Is that accurate?
[47:55.160 --> 47:56.160]  No.
[47:56.160 --> 47:57.160]  No, not really.
[47:57.160 --> 48:00.480]  What you have is the Abrams tank does have DU components.
[48:00.480 --> 48:03.840]  If those things are penetrated or you have any problem, you'll have a portion.
[48:03.840 --> 48:08.240]  But the main problem is with the Abrams and everything, and the Bradley, they have such
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.280]  an upload of DU missions on board that if you get hit by friendly fire, which is what
[48:13.280 --> 48:17.480]  happened during Gulf War I, because the majority of the deaths and wounds were friendly fire
[48:17.480 --> 48:22.440]  from DU during Gulf War I, what you have is all the release of not only what was shot
[48:22.440 --> 48:24.680]  at it, but you have the release of what was on board.
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.560]  Now, in the Iraqi equivalent, one thing that we verify is part of the captured equipment
[48:28.560 --> 48:29.560]  project.
[48:29.560 --> 48:32.480]  That thing is chock-full of radioactive materials on its own.
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.000]  Okay, so you have those things released during the detonation that are inherent components
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.240]  of the Iraqi equipment, or the Soviet equipment, whether it's the BMP, that's the Armored
[48:42.240 --> 48:47.640]  Personnel Carrier, that his son went in to treat the guy, or any of the tanks, or anything
[48:47.640 --> 48:48.640]  else.
[48:48.640 --> 48:50.840]  And so you have all this combination.
[48:50.840 --> 48:54.280]  The other thing that's important to understand is not only have uranium munitions, you don't
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.760]  just have a pile of solid radioactive dust, but all the other contaminants that are all
[48:59.760 --> 49:00.760]  mixed together.
[49:00.760 --> 49:03.760]  And so what this is, is a synergistic toxic wasteland.
[49:03.760 --> 49:04.760]  All right.
[49:04.760 --> 49:05.760]  Let me give out the nump.
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.680]  Mr. Garten, I appreciate you having the courage to come on the broadcast, and I'm so sorry
[49:10.680 --> 49:12.240]  about your sign.
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.040]  But how do people contribute to help out your grandchildren?
[49:16.040 --> 49:24.120]  They can make a donation to the Bank of America in the order of Clay W. Garten, and that's
[49:24.120 --> 49:26.120]  in Raytown, Missouri.
[49:26.120 --> 49:38.320]  And the address there is 1-0-1-0-0-E, East 350 Highway, Raytown, Missouri at 64138 Zip.
[49:38.320 --> 49:44.880]  The phone number is area code 816-979-6294.
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.080]  And we appreciate anything that anybody can do, and we appreciate you giving us the opportunity
[49:50.080 --> 49:56.520]  to discuss our pain and misery and our feelings of what's been going on, and the gentleman
[49:56.520 --> 49:57.920]  that's on the air with you.
[49:57.920 --> 50:03.680]  I hope you have a good fight, and we can all do this together, and get this stuff stopped
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.200]  because we should not be killing our own people.
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.200]  And we had a civil war here many hundred years ago, and we don't need it anymore.
[50:12.200 --> 50:16.360]  I want to just keep you a few more minutes on the other side, and then we'll let you
[50:16.360 --> 50:17.360]  go Mr. Garten.
[50:17.360 --> 50:22.560]  I'm going to ask you and Mr. Rocky both when we get back why the establishment doesn't
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.720]  care about the preach, you know, the psychology of this, because they know, but just do a
[50:26.720 --> 50:29.000]  few more minutes with us, Mr. Garten, and we'll let you go, and we'll continue then
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  with Dr. Rocky.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.200]  We'll get into more detail about DU and how to stop this.
[50:34.200 --> 50:38.800]  We're going to break for 70 seconds, come back with a third hour, finish up with Mr.
[50:38.800 --> 50:48.240]  Garten, and then continue with Mr. Rocky, and type your calls at www.BullWars.com.
[50:48.240 --> 50:54.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[50:54.360 --> 50:55.360]  You want answers?
[50:55.360 --> 50:57.480]  Well, so does he.
[50:57.480 --> 51:05.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[51:05.800 --> 51:16.160]  For the last hour, we've had the father of Army Sergeant Clay Garten, who clearly was
[51:16.160 --> 51:20.160]  exposed to DU and believes that he was sick from it and he died.
[51:20.160 --> 51:25.520]  Many others have admittedly been contaminated and have been sick and have died, and our
[51:25.520 --> 51:26.520]  government doesn't care.
[51:26.520 --> 51:29.080]  They're going to keep using it, using even more of it, and then just not giving the people
[51:29.080 --> 51:31.040]  treatment and denying that it ever happened.
[51:31.040 --> 51:36.920]  Dr. Doug Rocky wrote, literally, the book on this, after he was there in the 1990s in
[51:36.920 --> 51:39.800]  Iraq, for General Schwarzkopf.
[51:39.800 --> 51:40.800]  He's become ill.
[51:40.800 --> 51:45.520]  Many members of his team have died from it, and we're going to let Mr. Garten go here
[51:45.520 --> 51:49.520]  in just a few minutes and then continue with Mr. Rocky, Dr. Rocky.
[51:49.520 --> 51:55.120]  But Clay and Dr. Rocky, both of you, in the few minutes we've got left here in this segment,
[51:55.120 --> 52:01.400]  Rumsfeld, Bush, Clinton, all these people know what this does, the Army's own documents,
[52:01.400 --> 52:07.640]  as you said, going back to the 70s and 80s, know how toxic and deadly this is, and there's
[52:07.640 --> 52:10.960]  other contaminants, not just DU in these DU rounds.
[52:10.960 --> 52:12.360]  Why don't they care?
[52:12.360 --> 52:15.320]  Why do they bomb bases and then send our troops in to breathe it?
[52:15.320 --> 52:18.320]  Dr. Rocky and then Mr. Garten.
[52:18.320 --> 52:20.640]  That's very easy.
[52:20.640 --> 52:23.520]  The purpose of war is to kill and destroy.
[52:23.520 --> 52:29.960]  The consequences of war are totally irrelevant, President Bush, ex-president Clinton, ex-president
[52:29.960 --> 52:35.720]  Bush number one, or anybody going back as far as I can remember down back to the 60s.
[52:35.720 --> 52:38.320]  The purpose is to kill and destroy.
[52:38.320 --> 52:43.640]  And when you send a warrior, as we'll say, charging machine gun nest, that warrior goes
[52:43.640 --> 52:47.400]  in there with an attitude that, first, I'm immune, I'm Superman, and nothing can happen
[52:47.400 --> 52:48.400]  to me.
[52:48.400 --> 52:52.680]  But then when it happens, they absolutely just totally disregard the health and environmental
[52:52.680 --> 52:54.480]  effects.
[52:54.480 --> 53:00.240]  In March of 1991, and again, you have a reference to this, I think you're linked to it, I received
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.680]  a memorandum from the Los Alamos National Labs called, what we call the Fame Los Alamos
[53:05.680 --> 53:06.680]  Memo.
[53:06.680 --> 53:10.640]  It was written by Colonel Michael Zean, very specifically stated, that we should lie in
[53:10.640 --> 53:15.000]  our reports in order to sustain the use of uranium emissions because they're so effective
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.920]  in combat.
[53:16.920 --> 53:22.120]  Combat commander does not care, and the generals and the president don't care what happened
[53:22.120 --> 53:23.120]  to the troops.
[53:23.120 --> 53:26.280]  Well, that's like saying, let's drop neutron bombs on our troops because it'll kill the
[53:26.280 --> 53:27.280]  enemy too.
[53:27.280 --> 53:28.280]  Well, yeah.
[53:28.280 --> 53:29.280]  Really, that's about it.
[53:29.280 --> 53:30.280]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[53:30.280 --> 53:34.120]  Well, in my opinion, they should have just nuked the whole country and not even send
[53:34.120 --> 53:37.840]  our troops in, and then we would have wasted them all, instead of doing it slowly, we'd
[53:37.840 --> 53:38.840]  kill them all at once.
[53:38.840 --> 53:42.880]  Well, you know, sir, there's one of the things, and we have to go to this, and I was involved
[53:42.880 --> 53:48.200]  in the planning of this, I mean, Gulf War II, Iraqi operation, Iraqi freedom was totally
[53:48.200 --> 53:52.520]  ready to go by the summer of 2000, and then when Gore didn't get elected, the Khabash
[53:52.520 --> 53:54.680]  got put on that invasion.
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.800]  Iraq posed absolutely no threat to the United States.
[53:57.800 --> 53:58.800]  I know that.
[53:58.800 --> 54:03.360]  Iraq did not possess chemical or biological munitions by the middle of the 1990s.
[54:03.360 --> 54:05.920]  Scott Ritter and no chance of getting nuclear weapons.
[54:05.920 --> 54:10.560]  They had definitely none whatsoever, and they were never involved in 9-1-1 whatsoever.
[54:10.560 --> 54:13.120]  Well, what are we going to do about the one next door to them?
[54:13.120 --> 54:14.120]  I ran, they got it.
[54:14.120 --> 54:15.400]  What are we going to do about them?
[54:15.400 --> 54:18.120]  You know, again, that's the whole thing.
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.120]  In North Korea, what are we going to do about this?
[54:20.120 --> 54:21.120]  Where are we going to stop them?
[54:21.120 --> 54:25.040]  Well, your buddy, Donald Rumsfeld, helped give them the reactors, all of our buddies.
[54:25.040 --> 54:26.040]  He's our good friend.
[54:26.040 --> 54:28.960]  Yeah, well, we're going to stop and take care of our country.
[54:28.960 --> 54:34.400]  How about pulling all of our people back here, and we'll stand off anybody that comes, dammit,
[54:34.400 --> 54:36.320]  and we don't have to go somewhere else.
[54:36.320 --> 54:39.880]  If they want to kill each other and take over each other's country, who's that fine?
[54:39.880 --> 54:40.880]  Let's set a boundary here.
[54:40.880 --> 54:46.480]  Well, I think what Dr. Rocky was saying is that friendly fires killed more of our troops
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.600]  in the last few wars than the enemy, and now the DU and the chemicals are killing tens
[54:51.600 --> 54:54.600]  of thousands, and you're not supposed to talk about it.
[54:54.600 --> 54:55.600]  Dr. Rocky?
[54:55.600 --> 54:56.600]  That's correct.
[54:56.600 --> 54:57.600]  I mean, you have to understand.
[54:57.600 --> 54:59.520]  I mean, this is coming down to very simple.
[54:59.520 --> 55:05.520]  It's our own actions in our total disregard for the consequences of the weapons systems
[55:05.520 --> 55:11.080]  that we use and the destruction of the nation's infrastructure that we wrought when we go in
[55:11.080 --> 55:12.080]  on there.
[55:12.080 --> 55:16.460]  Let me just finish up with Mr. Garten real quick, Mr. Garten, I want to thank you for
[55:16.460 --> 55:17.960]  coming on the broadcast.
[55:17.960 --> 55:23.120]  I'm really sorry about your son, our prayers go with you and your family and your son,
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.720]  of course, and thank you for coming on and helping expose what DU really does, and hopefully
[55:28.720 --> 55:31.560]  we can change these policies and save a lot of lives.
[55:31.560 --> 55:37.800]  Thank you for having me, and Dr. Yu, take care and hope they get better for you and better
[55:37.800 --> 55:38.800]  for everybody.
[55:38.800 --> 55:39.800]  Thank you very much.
[55:39.800 --> 55:42.120]  Well, we're going to take care of our troops, sir.
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.120]  We'll be right back with Dr. Rocky.
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.600]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary
[55:49.600 --> 55:53.360]  exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[55:53.360 --> 55:57.200]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicled the globalist master plan for world
[55:57.200 --> 55:58.200]  domination.
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.000]  The Masters of Terror details how the leader using manufactured terrorism to drive the
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.520]  world population into accepting tyranny, witness in horror the execution of the September
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.960]  11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[56:08.960 --> 56:13.400]  The casual society control grid and viable microchips, mass mind control, militarization
[56:13.400 --> 56:17.680]  of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S. soil, U.S. a patriot, a super
[56:17.680 --> 56:20.640]  big brother total information awareness network, and much, much more.
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.880]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see The Masters of Terror only by exposing the perpetrators
[56:24.880 --> 56:25.880]  of September 11th.
[56:25.880 --> 56:29.720]  Can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional
[56:29.720 --> 56:30.720]  republic?

[56:38.920 --> 56:47.880]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.520]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.240]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.000]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.160]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water
[57:03.160 --> 57:06.680]  molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[57:06.680 --> 57:08.360]  The Berkeley light is different.
[57:08.360 --> 57:13.800]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing
[57:13.800 --> 57:14.800]  filters.
[57:14.800 --> 57:20.320]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria,
[57:20.320 --> 57:25.520]  cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul-taste odors, heavy
[57:25.520 --> 57:26.520]  metals, and nitrates.
[57:26.520 --> 57:32.920]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant
[57:32.920 --> 57:33.920]  ponds.
[57:33.920 --> 57:41.600]  You can advance Berkeley light for only $259 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.
[57:41.600 --> 57:45.760]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[57:45.760 --> 57:48.480]  Those dark depressing days are here.
[57:48.480 --> 57:52.640]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.280]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[57:56.280 --> 57:59.280]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[57:59.280 --> 58:02.280]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[58:02.280 --> 58:04.320]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[58:04.320 --> 58:06.640]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.200]  Check with your doctor.
[58:08.200 --> 58:13.560]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from sad seasonal affective disorder.
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.880]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special
[58:17.880 --> 58:18.880]  lights.
[58:18.880 --> 58:19.880]  Light up your life.
[58:19.880 --> 58:23.200]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a northern light.
[58:23.200 --> 58:30.560]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives
[58:30.560 --> 58:33.920]  or visit us at NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[58:33.920 --> 58:36.560]  That's NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[58:36.560 --> 59:05.560]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[59:07.560 --> 59:19.880]  Imagine a 1,000-pound dirty bomb.
[59:19.880 --> 59:24.120]  The horrible dirty bombs they've talked about that LCI-8 is going to try to use on us might
[59:24.120 --> 59:26.120]  weigh a couple hundred pounds.
[59:26.120 --> 59:34.680]  Our government hasn't used 1,000 pounds, they've used 1,000 tons, which is roughly 3,000
[59:34.680 --> 59:35.680]  pounds.
[59:35.680 --> 59:43.360]  In Iraq, just this round, a third of that in the first Gulf War, near that in Serbia,
[59:43.360 --> 59:49.920]  they've used near those levels in Afghanistan, their own manuals, going back to the 70s say
[59:49.920 --> 59:54.080]  that it does this, and then we have their own memos where they say we've got to cover
[59:54.080 --> 59:57.560]  this up because it's such a good weapon.
[59:57.560 --> 1:00:03.480]  And then we march our troops in as disposable heroes, and then I've got emails before,
[1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:05.960]  yeah, you commies, shut up.
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:10.360]  Well you just call up Mr. Garten then who just lost his son, and you go and you look
[1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:12.640]  at the graves, or you go to the funerals of these troops.
[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:16.960]  There's people dying right here in Austin, troops that come back and die and are buried
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:21.760]  bumping the ground, and they get these muscle spasms, these high fevers, they do the tests,
[1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:27.280]  they've got DU in them, from Texas to New York to Florida, the tests have been done.
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:31.320]  And so if you really care about the troops, if you really care about what's happening
[1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:36.720]  to them, you call your gods, Rush Limbaugh, and the rest of them, these neocons who aren't
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:43.360]  real conservatives, and you demand they talk about this, it's real funny, isn't it?
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:46.440]  You don't really care about the troops or America, you care about feeling like you're
[1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:51.200]  on a football team, the winning team, the neocon team, well your Democrat buddies did
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:52.200]  it too.
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:55.960]  We're going to go back to Dr. Rocky here in just a second and give him a floor and go
[1:00:55.960 --> 1:01:01.520]  over how we stopped this, what it's really doing, why they're doing it, on infowars.com,
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:06.520]  we have his three questions from Dr. Doug Rocky, PhD to the Department of Defense concerning
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:10.680]  its use of radioactive weapons, and I want to go over these three points with him.
[1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:15.600]  Before we do that just briefly, because I didn't plug him in the last hour, we fund
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:21.480]  this broadcast, and my staff and the four websites, and what we do off your purchases

[1:02:53.880 --> 1:03:00.640]  folks, that's the price of what five cups of coffee, a month to have access to all of
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:06.520]  this, to truly be informed, to have the facts and support what we're doing, prisonplanet.tv,
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:09.880]  fight the New Year's resolution to get the videos or to get a membership and to take
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:13.520]  action because it's such a powerful tool and waking people up.
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:18.760]  Dr. Rocky, continuing here, I mean, where should we go now?
[1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:26.280]  I mean, talking to Mr. Garten, you know, hearing about how his son died, number one, what are
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:32.920]  the numbers that you've got since DU was first used 13 years ago in the First Gulf War and
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:37.440]  now used in three other areas and, well, four other areas, also here in the U.S. at least
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:44.880]  10 different zones, open air, mass munitions at these different, you know, weapons testing
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:52.240]  grounds and all these battlefields where they're doing these simulated wars, all of them.
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:54.920]  How many people are sick and dying from this?
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:59.560]  We have to look at all of the combinations of the effects we had.
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:04.600]  We can't isolate the exposures out to one given thing and that's what's been the absolute
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:07.360]  horrifying thing about this whole thing.
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.920]  We know the individuals, when they had very specific exposures to uranium munitions contamination
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:15.720]  by an inhalation ingestion or absorption or the shrapnel in their wounds if they're
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:16.720]  going to have problems.
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:21.680]  And I'm going to go back to the middle of last year where, you know, I actually have
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:31.520]  the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs reports out of 696,841 individuals that served during
[1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:38.960]  the Persian Gulf War proper the combat action from August of 1990 through November, October
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:41.480]  November of 1991.
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:47.800]  As of May of last year, 230,000 or 231,000 had put in for claims because they were sick
[1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:49.680]  and ill.
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:54.720]  And the VA had awarded, this is just those involved in the active combat phase of Gulf
[1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:58.640]  War I, 179,310.
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:03.320]  Now we know the most current data and reports we've had in the last few weeks that this
[1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:09.080]  number now is over 181,000 that are on permanent disability.
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:14.120]  Now they denied medical care to over 27,000 people.
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:15.360]  That includes my own staff.
[1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:18.920]  And I'm still, we were just fighting in the last few days still trying to get my own staff
[1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:21.480]  medical care 14 years after the fact.
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:25.200]  And you were there removing the destroyed vehicles that have been shot up with this
[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:26.200]  stuff?
[1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:29.080]  Oh yeah, we were doing everything under the sun with hazards, materials, all the dehumidations
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:32.080]  that came by on rad, the whole mess.
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:33.960]  So that's what we know has happened.
[1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:42.120]  Now of everybody that served in the Persian Gulf region from August of 1990 through May
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:50.880]  of 2004, we had over 327,000 that have put in for permanent claims, the VA.
[1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:54.480]  And the VA had awarded permanent disabilities over 257,000.
[1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.760]  That's one third of the force.
[1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:01.560]  Now I've read the number that as of a few years ago was 35,000.
[1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:04.320]  The groups have died for different reasons.
[1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:07.080]  Now I'm hearing that number is 50,000 just from the first Gulf War.
[1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:08.080]  Is that accurate?
[1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:10.920]  It's probably too low.
[1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:11.920]  I can't get it right.
[1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:13.680]  It's just astonishing.
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:16.800]  Then we go to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:23.240]  Again, as of August of this last year, we already had the VA awarded permanent disability
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.240]  to 27,571.
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:27.840]  We're at 20% within one year.
[1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:31.720]  We had 153 cases of cancer.
[1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:41.520]  We had to go to some of the bigger numbers, 5,375 of the neuropsych, over 5,000 neurological
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:44.280]  respiratory digestive, over 6,000.
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:50.640]  I mean, we're seeing skin problems, which has devastated me and all my staff, neuromuscular,
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:51.640]  over 8,000.
[1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:55.920]  These are permanent problems already with the kids.
[1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:56.920]  Let's get personal.
[1:06:56.920 --> 1:07:00.960]  Your team, how big was it, how many people have gotten cancer, how many have died?
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:03.080]  Real good, hard put together.
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:06.800]  If we look at the total number of individuals, the U.S. Department of Defense totally acknowledged
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:12.120]  was involved in friendly power, plus all of our cleanup, that's over 400 individuals.
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.520]  From a group of how many?
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:15.520]  That's over 400 individuals.
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:19.080]  So, out of 400 individuals, how many have gotten cancer or have gotten cancer?
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:22.920]  It's a real hard thing to put, but we've been able to look at all the data.
[1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:26.520]  We got well over 20 or dead out of the primary 100.
[1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:29.160]  The thing that's astonishing, which is really bad news on this-
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:31.600]  Well, that's 20% out of the primary 100.
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:32.600]  Yeah, it is.
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:37.440]  And what we look at, which is really bad news on this whole thing, is even though we had
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.840]  424 individuals there that I can specifically identify, the Department of Defense is totally
[1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:48.840]  acknowledging their own documents, they told President Bill Clinton back in 1998, that was
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:54.720]  seven years after the fact, they'd only notified 104 and 105 individuals out of 424 that they
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:59.020]  need medical care seven years after the fact, and as the Department of Defense is totally
[1:07:59.020 --> 1:08:00.520]  acknowledging here even recently-
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:04.240]  So, they're even admitting, yes, you've been poisoned, you need care, but the mainstream
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:05.240]  media still is.
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.240]  Do you, Bob, for you?
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:09.960]  Well, the other thing too is, but you can't get medical care.
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:13.600]  I mean, up until even the last few days, I'm still fighting to get medical care for my
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:18.640]  Sergeant, who they claim, the Department of the Army down at the National Records Center
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:22.720]  in St. Louis, Missouri, claims he was never there, but you go to the unclassified classified
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:25.200]  reports and the book overseas all over the place.
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:31.880]  So, what we have is just a total absolute disregard for the existing orders and regulations
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:36.400]  that mandate medical care for everybody, and they just totally walk away.
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:40.680]  Now, the thing, and this is the horrifying thing about this thing, which has really bothered
[1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:45.760]  me completely, now we have another, one of our warriors, another son, Sergeant Gardner,
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:49.800]  who's died, over nothing.
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:53.680]  That's what's really the tragedy here, it's all over nothing.
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:58.760]  But then, when we send our troops in with inadequate training, for example, right here
[1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:04.160]  on your Champaign, Illinois, we're getting ready to deploy over 600 members of the Second
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:09.200]  Battalion, 130th Illinois Army Infantry National Guard to Iraq.
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:14.000]  They're leaving within hours, okay, that's how close it is.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:19.040]  They do not have the training, because I've talked to them, they do not have the equipment,
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:21.040]  and they're being sent into a nightmare again.
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:25.440]  Well, I've read the Army doesn't even allow the issuance of the training manuals about
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:26.440]  to you.
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:27.440]  Well, they haven't done that.
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:30.840]  I mean, the number of orders that were issued once they completed all this stuff back in
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:37.040]  the 90s, and again, reissued in the total, just refuses to do it, it just continued travesty
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:38.040]  and a tragedy.
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.480]  Why every war do they do this to our troops, and now it's getting even worse?
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:46.000]  I mean, why do they almost take an enjoyment in hurting the troops even greater than the
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.240]  enemy does, and then not even giving them treatment?
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:51.680]  Well, part of the thing is, it's just one in the battle and one in the war with a total
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.600]  disregard for the health and environmental effects.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:57.720]  You have to understand, let's go back to what I learned from my days in Vietnam.
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:09:58.720]  We're totally expendable.
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:05.280]  Well, that shows Rumsfeld's disconnect going, hey, you go to war with the Army, you've got,
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:07.320]  they had years to get ready for this.
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:13.240]  Well, we actually planned to put this in together years ago, so all this stuff is happening.
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:17.040]  When you look at the training, the operations, and all the exercise we have is all put together,
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:19.360]  but it's totally disregard.
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:21.200]  It's real simple.
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:24.680]  The United States uses uranium emissions because they're extremely effective.
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.160]  They destroy a nation's infrastructure, release all the toxic industrial chemicals, they don't
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:33.200]  provide the troops with the protection they needed, they don't clean up the mess they're
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:37.360]  supposed to do, then they put the troops in there, and the kids come back sick, and they
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:39.880]  die, and nobody gives a flying.
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:46.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:42.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:31.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:38.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:08.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:41.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:51.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:14:20.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:42.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:50.880]  I want the military personnel listening.
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:53.880]  I want the police listening.
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:57.880]  I want people to serve this government who are listening to understand.
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:08.880]  They admittedly left 20 plus thousand American and British POWs in Nazi camps and let Stalin
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:09.880]  have them.
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:10.880]  That's admitted.
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:12.880]  I want the documents mainstream.
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:18.880]  Roosevelt, and this is now the documents were declassified two years ago, then major New
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:25.880]  York papers, but just back of the paper, ordered the Navy to leave 7,000 American citizens in
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:31.880]  the Philippines so they'd be captured because it would quote be good propaganda in the newsreels.
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:35.880]  7,000 lives, 4,000 plus of them died in the camps.
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:39.880]  I've interviewed people who were six years old in the camps, watching their mothers and
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:43.880]  mothers being tortured and raped by the Japanese who are pretty brittle, just so they could
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:47.880]  have some propaganda in newsreels about having our civilians.
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:52.880]  Oh, but they wouldn't be involved in 9-11, the globalist would.
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:53.880]  Oh, no.
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:58.880]  They wouldn't market drugs that they know are dangerous on the market that a government
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:15:59.880]  cares about you.
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:01.880]  The government loves you.
[1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:05.880]  The government's run by sweetie pies that are just so nice.
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:10.880]  And Dr. Rocky, most of the troops of police I've talked to know something's wrong, support
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:14.880]  what I'm doing, what you're doing, but a few weeks ago I was buying some Christmas presents
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:19.880]  at an academy sporting goods store, and then I walked up and he's like, I fly helicopters
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:23.880]  for the night stockers, and I'm like, you're full of it.
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:24.880]  And blah, blah, blah.
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:27.880]  I said, well, you know, the vaccines have been admitted to be deadly, and that's admitted.
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:28.880]  Ah, whatever.
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:30.880]  Well, you better watch out with DU.
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:32.880]  He's sort of laughing at me.
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:38.880]  I mean, you know, what's funny about this when their own manuals say it, but I'm bad?
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:42.880]  How is it not patriotic that I stand up for the troops, that I gave out the phone number
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:45.880]  to raise money for this dead soldier's family?
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:46.880]  How is that bad?
[1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:50.880]  But these people just sit there doing nothing for the soldiers, and even some soldiers laugh
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:51.880]  about it, Dr. Rocky.
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:54.880]  I wish I had the answer to that question.
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:17:01.880]  Many, many years ago, between combat missions, we were, this is Vietnam days, and some events
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:04.880]  happened, and my commandant in general was right there.
[1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:05.880]  I stayed in touch with him.
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:08.880]  We stayed in French for over 30 years.
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:11.880]  He had told us back in Vietnam days between combat missions.
[1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:14.880]  He said, you know, I'm going to always take care of you, and I want you to always take
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:17.880]  care of the troops, because that's our primary responsibility.
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:22.880]  Right before he died here a few years ago, he looked at me and said, well, Sergeant Rock,
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:26.880]  because at that time I was just Sergeant, and if I'm going through all the ranks, he said,
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:28.880]  Sergeant Rock, that's how he remembered me.
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:31.880]  Are you still taking care of the troops?
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:33.880]  And in general, yes, sir, I am.
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:38.880]  But we have to understand, with the uranium emissions use, the United States made the
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:42.880]  conscious, the United States officials, Department of Defense officials.
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  You have the document.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:48.880]  Oh, absolutely, made the conscious choice to use uranium emissions in disregard of the
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:50.880]  health and environmental effects.
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:54.880]  The Army regulation, and I'm looking at it right here, signed by General Shinseki, who
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:59.880]  issued the original order back in October 93 to clean up the medical care, provide all
[1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:05.880]  the training, and clean up all environmental contamination that got me on this whole BU
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:06.880]  project.
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:10.880]  This Army regulation specifically states, I'm going to read this quote, Commander's
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:15.880]  Radiation Safety Officer will identify, segregate, isolate, secure, and label all
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.880]  radiologic contaminated equipment.
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:21.880]  Procedures to minimize the spread of radioactivity will be implemented as soon as
[1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:22.880]  possible.
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:23.880]  Okay?
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:24.880]  That's not a question.
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:26.880]  That's a direct order.
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:29.880]  The unit team, the individual responsible for the equipment, whether friendly or
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:33.880]  foreign, at the time of damage or contaminate is responsible for taking all actions
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:37.880]  consistent to this regulation and the pamphlet that I wrote.
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.880]  We come on down.
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:44.880]  All equipment to include captured or combat radiological contaminated equipment will be
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:49.880]  surveyed, packaged, retrograded, decontaminated, and released in accordance with the technical
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:56.880]  bullets in 9-1300-278 that specifies contamination levels.
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:18:59.880]  Personnel, quote, personnel handling contaminated equipment need to follow personal
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:02.880]  safety measures outlined in the pamphlet.
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:05.880]  That requires full respiratory and skin protection.
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.880]  We keep coming on down.
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:11.880]  Rush Limbaugh says it's nutritious.
[1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:12.880]  How about that?
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:14.880]  How about he eats some of those meaties?
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.880]  How about let him eat all this stuff?
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:20.880]  The requirements exist.
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:26.880]  The U.S. Army regulation, which has the same force as U.S. federal law, requires thorough
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:27.880]  cleanup.
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:29.880]  We come on down to the next section.
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:31.880]  It absolutely mandates medical care.
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:33.880]  Not a question.
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.880]  Not a thing, well, I'll think about it.
[1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:38.880]  It says, thou shalt provide medical care.
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:45.880]  When we look at the technical bulletin that we revised based on all our research and
[1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:52.880]  firsthand experience, not somebody sitting at a desk thinking about this stuff, but
[1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:56.880]  what you really do and how you clean up the mess.
[1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:58.880]  That's the kind of science I did.
[1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:03.880]  That's what I did as a super garbage man, to clean up the mess.
[1:20:03.880 --> 1:20:11.880]  When you look at the very specific specifications, it's not, i.e., something that
[1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:13.880]  you say I can get around with.
[1:20:13.880 --> 1:20:17.880]  We know that the level of contamination that exists throughout Iraq and the camp where
[1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:22.880]  the soldiers there in the combat areas exceed any permissible levels.
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:25.880]  We know that the Department of Defense officials are not cleaning up.
[1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:26.880]  They're not providing the troops.
[1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:27.880]  Stay there.
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:29.880]  Let's do a few more minutes on the other side and take some calls.
[1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:34.880]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.880]  We're on the march.
[1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:38.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:44.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:49.880]  You've heard about POS from Biowox International and its bubble up technology, but have you
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:53.880]  heard about Biowox citrus concentrate that also uses bubble up technology?
[1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:58.880]  Biowox citrus concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt,
[1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:00.880]  stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:05.880]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by
[1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:08.880]  dust, or your walls by color crayons.
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:11.880]  But in minutes you can remove those problems with Biowox citrus concentrate.

[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:37.880]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  When you see the difference, you'll know why.
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:43.880]  It's just better to use Biowox family of products.
[1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:46.880]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:47.880]  Hello folks.
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:52.880]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements
[1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:57.880]  for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights black Berkey purification elements.
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:01.880]  The Berkeys PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:06.880]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:13.880]  chemicals, radon-2-2-2, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:18.880]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual
[1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:20.880]  heavy metal ions are separated.
[1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:23.880]  Your purified water is now ready.
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:28.880]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post filter elements.
[1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:37.880]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two cents for only $89 by calling new millennium at 888-8034438.
[1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:39.880]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:40.880]  That's toll-free.
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:44.880]  Cripple-8-803438.
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:48.880]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet is not likely according
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:50.880]  to the World Health Organization.
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:55.880]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.880]  leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:01.880]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.880]  likely that same mineral deficiency.
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:07.880]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:11.880]  considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[1:23:11.880 --> 1:23:13.880]  Either way, why chance it?
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:20.880]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to C-minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.880]  on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:33.880]  from the sea.
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:37.880]  Call C-minerals today toll-free 877-835-5555.
[1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:43.880]  That's 877-835-5555 or visit cmineral.com.
[1:23:43.880 --> 1:23:53.880]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:57.880]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:24:02.880]  I know we kind of loaded phones for the last hour and a half but I haven't been taking
[1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:05.880]  calls because I've had two guests on about DU.
[1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:10.880]  You want to talk about depleting uranium or examples of our government not caring about
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:11.880]  its own minions.
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  Just to show you how ruthless these corporate creatures are.
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:19.880]  We'll go to John and Roger and a few others that are holding.
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:25.880]  Plus a caller wants to talk about a Casper Wyoming Star Tribune article about Clarence
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:26.880]  Thomas the Bohemian Grove.
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:27.880]  I saw it this morning.
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:29.880]  Didn't print it for some reason.
[1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  Didn't bring it.
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:32.880]  But we'll talk to that caller about that too.
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:34.880]  1-800-2599-231.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:40.880]  You want to talk to Dr. Doug Rocky, an American hero, a Vietnam veteran.
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:45.880]  I literally wrote the book in the early 90s on DU and how deadly it is for the Pentagon.
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:48.880]  The official Army regulations not being followed.
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:53.880]  And then the neocons get on radio like the gun grabbing open border, big government promoting
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.880]  scum they are and tell you it's conservative.
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:57.880]  It's good for you.
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:24:58.880]  I mean, I've heard them.
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:24:59.880]  It's good for you.
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:00.880]  It's not bad.
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:01.880]  It's safe.
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:02.880]  It's completed.
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.880]  It's not a problem.
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:06.880]  It's total fraud.
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:07.880]  Okay?
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:12.880]  Two rims of radiation New York Daily News did blood test at a major firm.
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:14.880]  I mean, that's very high levels, folks.
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:19.880]  But before we go back to Dr. Rocky and your calls, I want to play this clip.
[1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:23.880]  I played it probably 10 times over the last few months for local CBS News.
[1:25:23.880 --> 1:25:27.880]  This has been all over the country, similar reports, where they tell you new reports.
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:29.880]  Mercury's good for your child's brain.
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:32.880]  I expect them to say uranium's good for you soon.
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:34.880]  This is the just incredible lying.
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:37.880]  I want to get from our scientists, from our PhD.
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:40.880]  I want to get a comment on mercury being nutritious for you.
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:26:09.880]  Go ahead and play this clip.
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:22.880]  Okay.
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:25.880]  Then I get into a new defibrillator.
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:29.880]  The point here is, this one study was done by a big drug company that makes vaccines
[1:26:29.880 --> 1:26:33.880]  together by the feds, and they have literally thousands of studies about how bad mercury
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  is for the brain, especially at 200 times safe levels.
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:40.880]  That's what a six-month-old gets over the first round of shots.
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:42.880]  Dr. Rocky, this is a side issue.
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:44.880]  They're now telling us that mercury's good for us.
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:46.880]  Do you think that's true?
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:48.880]  This is pure nonsense.
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:50.880]  That's a bottle, I can say.
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:53.880]  I mean, mercury, like all this stuff, are toxic heavy metal.
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:55.880]  If you get into the body, you're going to get sick.
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:56.880]  It's that simple.
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:26:57.880]  There is no safe level.
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:26:59.880]  This concept, your idea, there's safe levels.
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:00.880]  But, sort of, it's not just safe.
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:02.880]  It's good for your brain now.
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.880]  Well, I mean, we've had the same comments already made about the uranium contamination
[1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:08.880]  in the body.
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:12.880]  The U.S. Army officials have made those same comments recently.
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:13.880]  It's pure nonsense.
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:14.880]  Wait a minute.
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:15.880]  They're saying it's nutritious?
[1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:16.880]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:17.880]  You're joking.
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:18.880]  I mean, it's pure nonsense.
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  I have to understand.
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:21.880]  I'm going to go back.
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:22.880]  I'm going to make this loud and clear.
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:27.880]  The Los Alamos memorandum, which you have a link to on your website, very specifically
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:31.880]  stated, to lie on the reports in order to sustain the use of uranium emissions.
[1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:33.880]  I have a link to that, but do you have that in front of you?
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:34.880]  Can you read that?
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:35.880]  Sure.
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:36.880]  And then we'll go to calls.
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  This is where they're saying, this is a great weapon.
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:41.880]  Let's lie about it.
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:44.880]  Give me time to dig it out.
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:45.880]  Yeah.
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:52.880]  It's just, I mean, when we look at all of the stuff that's happening, I don't even know
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:53.880]  how to.
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:56.880]  I don't know even how to get there.
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:27:57.880]  I'm not finding it right now.
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:27:59.880]  Let me try to dig it out.
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:01.880]  I've got to, I've got to pronounce, but go ahead.
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:02.880]  Yeah.
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:03.880]  It just, there's so much stuff.
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:07.880]  I mean, it's just, it's just absolute pure nonsense.
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:08.880]  And you know, we can go.
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:11.880]  Well, tell us what that particular officer said.
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:15.880]  Well, what is said very specifically stated, we need to, you know, ensure the use of uranium
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:16.880]  emissions.
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:19.880]  We need to put it together and there have to be total proponents.
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:23.880]  And whenever we write after action reports to ensure that we sustain the use of uranium
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:24.880]  emissions.
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:26.880]  I mean, that's been going off and on forever.
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:29.880]  And with director of the depleted uranium project, all this information started coming
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:33.880]  out and I'm going, well, you know, we got it all get this put together, but the same
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  thing, we're trying to make sure it's taken care of within the military.
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:37.880]  So what's next?
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:39.880]  We're going to start saying cyanide's good for you.
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:40.880]  Who knows?
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:44.880]  I mean, you know, it's just pure total nonsense.
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:48.880]  Thing is, it's happening here.
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:53.880]  The idea and the concept just to go and destroy and totally disregard the health and environmental
[1:28:53.880 --> 1:28:58.880]  warfare, whether it's uranium emissions or destruction of a nation's infrastructure, and walk away
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:02.880]  just for power and greed and everything else is what's driving it all around.
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:06.880]  The sick part is the current White House and it was the same for Clinton.
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.880]  He's a bunch of chicken hawks.
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:11.880]  Well, I mean, it's, you know, you have to understand all these people involved in this stuff go
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:12.880]  back through multiple administrations.
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:14.880]  It's not any one given thing.
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:19.880]  The guys that are running this thing now under Bush 2 were the same ones that were doing it
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:23.880]  under Clinton and some of them were involved in Bush 1 and they go back forever.
[1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:25.880]  You need to understand it doesn't change.
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:27.880]  It doesn't change.
[1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:33.880]  The horrifying thing about this thing is now we got Sergeant Gardner, you know, his, you
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:35.880]  know, died right after Christmas, you know, and all this stuff.
[1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:38.880]  He was again abandoned by his nation.
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:43.880]  But yet now they have to go out and put a fund together to take care of his children.
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:44.880]  Okay.
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:46.880]  That's ludicrous.
[1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:50.880]  Bush is going back to spend millions upon millions upon millions of dollars for this friggin
[1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:51.880]  inauguration.
[1:29:51.880 --> 1:29:52.880]  Okay.
[1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:57.880]  Why don't they give one of those million dollars to this family and they help take care of this
[1:29:57.880 --> 1:29:58.880]  family.
[1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:00.880]  That's where the reality is.
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:06.880]  I'm tired of our nation's soldiers being sent to war with inadequate training, with inadequate
[1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:11.880]  equipment in totally contaminated environments, not being provided the mandated medical care
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:18.880]  that is required by direct orders, put into areas where the contamination is whole all
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:23.880]  over the place because it has not been cleaned up, even though it's absolutely required by
[1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:26.880]  U.S. Army Regulation Department of Defense regulations.
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:33.880]  Well, they use three times as much D.U. and Iraq this time as 14 years ago or 13 and a
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:34.880]  half years ago.
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:39.880]  And they use it in all the populated areas instead of out the middle of the desert.
[1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:42.880]  And if we've had thousands of people die from it in the first one, what are the numbers
[1:30:42.880 --> 1:30:43.880]  going to be this time?
[1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:45.880]  I mean, the numbers are already astronomical.
[1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:50.880]  When we're looking at over 20% of the current force after one year already being permanently
[1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.880]  disabled, you've got to ask what the question is.
[1:30:53.880 --> 1:31:00.880]  It's not IE 6 or 8,000 that have been wounded and another 1,200 or 1,400 that have died.
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:04.880]  It's all these other 1,000 that have died, like Sergeant Gardner, that are not counted.
[1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:09.880]  And it's all these other 27,000 have already been given permanent disability within one
[1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:10.880]  year.
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:15.880]  I mean, the casually count is just astronomical and it's over nothing.
[1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:16.880]  Okay?
[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:19.880]  The regulations mandate medical care.
[1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:21.880]  The regulations mandate it.
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:22.880]  That's my point.
[1:31:22.880 --> 1:31:26.880]  Why did I have an Army officer laughing at me saying he'd been told it was a conspiracy
[1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:32.880]  by his superiors when I was saying your own manual says it's deadly and he's laughing at
[1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:33.880]  me?
[1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:38.880]  You have to remember you get in this mindset where they got everything put together, okay?
[1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:42.880]  And the individual, the group think and they say, well, this is what they tell me so therefore
[1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:43.880]  it's there.
[1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:48.880]  You know, if I hadn't been there and learned it myself, okay, and went through the process
[1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:52.880]  of understanding what happened and making the decision that can't go along with this nonsense
[1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.880]  anymore, I might have stuck in there with those guys.
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:31:59.880]  But what I learned and what I saw in a military career that spanned over, you know, well over
[1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:04.880]  30 years in all these special considerations is they don't care.
[1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:11.880]  And for a soldier that believes this stuff but doesn't look and says, I'll give you an
[1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:12.880]  example.
[1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:17.880]  The U.S. Army and Department of Defense officials that are responsible for radiation safety
[1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:23.880]  for the troops in our nation's troops right now and in the past have absolutely point blank
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:28.880]  refused to join me in my effort to ensure that medical care is provided to our nation's
[1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:30.880]  sons and daughters as ordered by the U.S.
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:35.880]  Surgeon General and the environmental contamination is cleaned up as ordered by General Shinseki.
[1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.880]  They refuse to help us do that.
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:43.880]  So when we hear support the troops, that means live in denial, drink your six pack, don't care
[1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:44.880]  about the troops.
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:46.880]  Now this is number three of your three questions.
[1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:50.880]  By what legal or ethical right can members of the United States military, any other nation's
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:56.880]  military, disperse tons of uranium weapons with radioactive and heavy metal toxic contamination.
[1:32:56.880 --> 1:33:02.880]  America's own dirty bomb any place in the world when those radioactive materials will
[1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:09.880]  then contaminate air, water, soil with consequence of adverse health effects as we know will
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:10.880]  occur.
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:14.880]  We must remember that one of the findings published by the U.S. Army Environment Policy Institute
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:18.880]  in their 95 report on depleted uranium was quoted.
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:23.880]  No available toxicology can significantly change the inherent chemical and radiological toxicity
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:24.880]  of DU.
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:27.880]  These are intrinsic properties of uranium.
[1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:30.880]  Hey, Mercury's bad for you, folks, in high levels.
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:32.880]  Uranium's bad for you.
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:40.880]  It is not vitamin C. And we're radical, Dr. Rocky, because you were one of the head guys
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:42.880]  who wrote the book on this for them.
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:45.880]  You're radical because you say it as the troops die.
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:48.880]  I'm radical because I know Mercury isn't good for me.
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:51.880]  The world's turned toxic, Irving.
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:52.880]  Let's take some calls.
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:57.880]  John, in New York, you're on the air with insane people that think uranium is bad for you.
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:58.880]  Go ahead.
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:33:59.880]  Hi.
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:00.880]  I'm just going to tell you about a VA hospital.
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:01.880]  I got about three points.
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:02.880]  I'll make it quick.
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:06.880]  VA hospital here in our town, they tried to fire one of the local workers.
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:07.880]  They had a bad back.
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:09.880]  They tried not to pay my workman's comp.
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:12.880]  He ended up going through court procedures and all that.
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:16.880]  When he got said and done, the boss put paperwork in his file that was bought.
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:19.880]  And the secretary admitted that in court.
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:22.880]  He proved his case and he got his job back.
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:26.880]  When it got said and done, the description of what actually happened is a fraudulent description
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:27.880]  put in the file.
[1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:29.880]  And the boss has still got his job.
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:35.880]  Secondly, can we use like pH to dictate possibly a measure of if you've got DU, it would be
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:38.880]  an inherent measure of, hey, I got a problem here.
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:39.880]  It might be an indicator.
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:46.880]  Secondly, my other son went into military and he was a band-aid, there'll be a medical.
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:51.880]  And when they came out of military a year later, he tells me oxygen is bad for you.
[1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:53.880]  I said, who the hell pulled your axe?
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:54.880]  Use my language.
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:57.880]  But, you know, it's just the other extreme of the case.
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:05.880]  And the last thing is, as far as the UN outlaws using dirty bombs or whatever else, now they've
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:09.880]  got tools for ourselves to use that, hey, you didn't enforce law on that side.
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:13.880]  So now when you say we've got a mandate that we're going to be Euro or World Order, whatever,
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  we don't have to mandate that rule because you have to mandate the other rules.
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:18.880]  It's just, it's a bad game again.
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:19.880]  Thank you very much.
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:20.880]  Thank you, John.
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:23.880]  Yeah, this is systemic corruption in the VA.
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:25.880]  Would you like to speak to that?
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  Dr. Rocky?
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:27.880]  Well, it's an ongoing thing.
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:33.880]  I mean, what has happened is care has been denied, inappropriate care has been given,
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:38.880]  care has been delayed, or when they give you the care, they totally disregard it.
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:41.880]  When you're going for health problems, they totally disregard it, or they just say we're
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:42.880]  doing you a favor.
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:45.880]  And I want to add a caveat to police and firemen listening.
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:48.880]  This is NBC News, folks, but back of the paper.
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:52.880]  And this is in the 9-11 section of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:57.880]  Those buildings, Tower 1 and 2, were built, were insulated with asbestos.
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:35:59.880]  That's admitted.
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:01.880]  And the people got incredibly sick.
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:07.880]  The FDA, excuse me, the EPA put out the report and said they've got huge amounts of particulates
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:08.880]  in their lungs.
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:14.880]  Of this, they're very sick, they need a fund, and George Bush blocked the fund to get medical
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:16.880]  treatment to the firemen and police.
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:19.880]  Forget the civilians, as they call us.
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:24.880]  So, again, there's another example just of how they'll have all these tributes to you,
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:29.880]  all this saffiness on TV crying and loving you and telling you what heroes you are, but
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:31.880]  they really don't care about you.
[1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:34.880]  Well, Christine Whitman actually authored the reports and all the contaminates that were
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:36.880]  involved here and where everybody got sick.
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:42.880]  I was a keynote speaker at an EPA conference with all the EPA headquarters in Cincinnati
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:44.880]  a year ago on all this stuff.
[1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:47.880]  It was right after that conference where all this stuff came out that Whitman got fired
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:49.880]  and stuff started coming out.
[1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:51.880]  So that's, again, a toxic wasteland.
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:53.880]  They don't care.
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:55.880]  I mean, it's just mind-boggling.
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:57.880]  But, again, what was it?
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:01.880]  $97 million, which sounds like a lot, but it's not when you got tens of thousands of police
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:02.880]  and firemen.
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:04.880]  And see, you didn't get it.
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:06.880]  You don't get anything.
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:10.880]  But you're going to pull me over and demand to search my car and act like a police state
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:12.880]  dog serving this system.
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:14.880]  It's stupid.
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:15.880]  That's good.
[1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:16.880]  What do we got another call?
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:17.880]  Yeah, let's go to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:19.880]  Roger, go ahead.
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:20.880]  Yeah, thanks.
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:25.880]  Dr. Doug, I've been wanting to ask, I assume you're probably at least a little more ordinance
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:27.880]  expert than I am, which would be sufficient.
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:33.880]  But am I correct in my surmise that even if one believes in DU rounds so that they say
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  in Bosnia and probably to a lesser extent, even in, say, the Iraqi context, that probably
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:45.880]  less than something like one to five percent of the time would that round make a difference
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:47.880]  from not requiring a second round, et cetera.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:52.880]  There's no very little reactive armor, et cetera, that would occasion the use of such a round.
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:53.880]  Is that about accurate?
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.880]  Well, let me put it even simpler than that.
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  A standard heat round, high-explosive or 50 cal rounds going to take out the equipment.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:03.880]  We never found a reactive armor, we never found anything that couldn't be penetrated
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:04.880]  by 50 cal rounds.
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:05.880]  Well, how about that?
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:06.880]  God bless you all.
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:10.880]  Yeah, that's a good point, as I've seen them admit on television that they shoot buildings
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:13.880]  up, regular cars, buses.
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:17.880]  But we've got the actual measurements, we've got the actual photographic records, we've
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:18.880]  got the video records.
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:24.880]  I mean, I've got video footage of US Army officers with all the contamination around, not putting
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:29.880]  their troops in a protective gear, not cleaning up and just simply refusing to do anything with
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:30.880]  it, just leaving it there.
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:32.880]  There's no question about this.
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:35.880]  Why are they just using it all over Iraq and more and more munitions?
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:41.880]  I mean, before it was just the Abrams dark round, the Sabo round, and in the Warthog
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:42.880]  Vulcan cannon.
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.880]  Why is it so many other, using so many other weapons now?
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:47.880]  Kills and destroys.
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:50.880]  This is a little curious thing.
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:51.880]  Well, here's a question.
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:54.880]  How many weapons systems do you know of as it being used in?
[1:38:54.880 --> 1:39:00.880]  We have it in the Abrams rounds, 105, 120 millimeter round, that's in the US side.
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:05.880]  We have it in 30 millimeter, each one of those are about 10 pounds solid uranium per round.
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:11.880]  The Bradley fighting vehicle uses a 25 millimeter round, that's about a half pound of solid uranium
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:12.880]  per round.
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:17.880]  The Warthog fire is a D round, each one's about three quarters of a pound of solid uranium
[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:18.880]  per round.
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:23.880]  The fire is at 4,000 rounds per minute, that's a ton and a half per minute on target.
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:27.880]  Then we have the Atom and the Petom, those are both sub munitions, those are land mines,
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:29.880]  those are cluster bombs contained in the EU.
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:31.880]  Then we have it in the 50 cal machine gun.
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:34.880]  You have left it there issuing it to everybody now.
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:39.880]  We have total confirmation on Abrams tank being taken out by a 50 cal DU round.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:41.880]  Excellent total confirmation, that question.
[1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:44.880]  Then we have it in the bunker busters, absolutely no doubt about it.
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:46.880]  We got it in the cruise missiles.
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:51.880]  You have to understand, this stuff is so effective that the warrior when they go to war or the
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:53.880]  guys that run the war are going to use it.
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:58.880]  The other thing too is, we're getting rid of all of our radiological waste at Oak Ridge
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:01.880]  in Tennessee, Portsmouth in Ohio and Paducah, Kentucky.
[1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:05.880]  They can't dispose of it there, so what we'll do is dispose it in another nation and walk
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:06.880]  away.
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:07.880]  Incredible.
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:12.880]  I know we got a bunch of calls, but John, specifically for Dr. Rocky, who's up next?
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:16.880]  Okay, well, we got callers calling in, but they're calling in about other issues, about
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:18.880]  Bohemian ground, other issues.
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:22.880]  So we're going to take calls on that, both, for talking about the plea uranium here in
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:25.880]  just the last few minutes we've got with Dr. Rocky here at the end of the year.
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:30.880]  Dr. Rocky, I couldn't have thought of a more important broadcast to do at the end of the
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:33.880]  year, because if they'll do this, they'll do anything.
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:36.880]  I mean, what else are they doing that is killing our own people?
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:40.880]  I mean, what does this say about enclosing the mindset of these people?
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:44.880]  Well, let's consider Project Shad is still an ongoing thing throughout the United States
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:48.880]  where they've deliberately exposed chemical and biologic munitions to our own troops as
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:50.880]  they've done for years and years and years.
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:51.880]  I've had to clean that up.
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:54.880]  I've had to provide medical care for the casualties, and that continues on.
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:41:00.880]  The thing is, again, as we end this year, the United States has gone to war again.
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:06.880]  They have sent our sons and daughters into war with defective equipment, with inadequate
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:11.880]  training, into a contaminated area where we refuse to provide, clean up the contamination
[1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:13.880]  that we caused.
[1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:18.880]  We're leaving that contamination there to affect the residents of those areas, and we've
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:22.880]  walked away and refused to provide medical care, and now we've got another American warrior,
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:28.880]  a son and daughter of America, son of America, who's died in Kansas City area, abandoned
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:31.880]  by his nation for which he gave his life for.
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:33.880]  Dr. Rocky, I'll see you in 2005.
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:35.880]  I want to get you back on about Project Shad.
[1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:37.880]  Thank you very much.
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:38.880]  Thank you for coming on.
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:40.880]  Hold on just one moment.
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:42.880]  We'll be right back, folks.
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:44.880]  Hold on just a second.
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:14.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:44.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:14.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:44.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:39.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:57.880]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:44:57.880 --> 1:44:58.880]  All right.
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:01.880]  You know, always the most important stuff gets said during breaks.
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:05.880]  Talking to Dr. Rocky, you know, he's having upper respiratory problems right now, bleeding
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:08.880]  rashes from the DU right now.
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:12.880]  A lot of his team has died that was there in 1991 or very ill.
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:16.880]  Finishing up, Dr. Rocky, during the break, we were talking about folks that go,
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:17.880]  oh, I trust the government.
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:18.880]  They wouldn't do that to me.
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:20.880]  And you had a comment to that.
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:21.880]  They're going to do it to you.
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:25.880]  And what I need to encourage right now, it's been all over the news and everybody,
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:30.880]  I need to have every mother and father, son and daughter, niece and nephew,
[1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:39.880]  grandparent, aunt and uncle, call their congressman, their senators, the president of the United States,
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:43.880]  call the secretary of defense and absolutely ensure mandate that our sons and daughters are not sent to war with
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:50.880]  defective equipment, inadequate training, and a total lack of medical care assessment before they go to war,
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:53.880]  when they're in war, and medical care when they come back.
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:55.880]  But you know, the cover-ups got to continue.
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:56.880]  They can't let it up.
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:57.880]  They did.
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:45:58.880]  This is like all the other cover-ups.
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:02.880]  Yeah, but the whole thing is we have to have everybody that yells and screams at no more.
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:03.880]  One of the things that I've been doing-
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:06.880]  Well, it's also a good reason not to join the military.
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:08.880]  Well, let me tell you, after 30-some years in the military,
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:10.880]  I've retired and disabled combat veteran.
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:14.880]  Right now, I wouldn't tell, I wouldn't advise anybody to join the military from what I've learned.
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:18.880]  But what we have to do now, we have to take care of our sons and daughters.
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:22.880]  Everybody must call and take action to demand and ensure they have adequate training,
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:23.880]  the equipment they need.
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:25.880]  They get the medical care before.
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:27.880]  They get the medical care during and after.
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:30.880]  And they're not put in there with effective equipment.
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.880]  And this nonsense from Rumpfelt said,
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:35.880]  well, you go to war, what you have is ridiculous.
[1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:40.880]  He has an obligation to ensure that our sons and daughters have the best equipment at all times.
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:43.880]  And when I hear words and I get back a message,
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:46.880]  send me a Christmas care package, send me socks, send me shoelaces,
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:49.880]  send me the simplest stuff, send me toilet paper.
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:53.880]  Did you know Halliburton charges him $100 for 10 pounds of laundry?
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:55.880]  Yeah, well, Halliburton has been ripping everybody off
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:47:00.880]  because I wrote the cleanup plan and gave to Halliburton by direct of the Secretary of State,
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:02.880]  Madeline Albright, back in 92.
[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:04.880]  What the heck?
[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:08.880]  Listen, Dr. Ross, you have a good new year and I want to get you back on soon about Project Shad,
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:12.880]  where they openly nerve gas and bio our troops and kill them and test it on them.
[1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:13.880]  I want to get you back on about that.
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.880]  And God bless you and thanks for your courage.
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:16.880]  Thank you.
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:18.880]  And God bless and happy new year to everybody.
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:21.880]  And to that family, we've got to take care of that family,
[1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:24.880]  but then we have to make sure our government takes care of all of the family.
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:27.880]  And stops what they're doing to begin with. Take care.
[1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:28.880]  Take care. Bye.
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:33.880]  Folks, I mean, again, so many people think they're members of the establishment.
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:37.880]  You defend it like a bunch of bees or something and it doesn't care about you.
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:38.880]  In fact, it hates you.
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:42.880]  The globalists have little contest about who's the most ruthless.
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:43.880]  Seriously, they do.
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:49.880]  It's a society of sickos that run the planet and they want you to think you're part of it.
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:51.880]  You're not, folks.
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:54.880]  Okay, this podcast is not radical.
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:56.880]  Mercury is not nutritious.
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:47:58.880]  Uranium is not good for you.
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:47:59.880]  This is true.
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:00.880]  This is real.
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.880]  The IMF World Bank public documents now are how to make the world starve,
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:08.880]  how to take our pension funds, how to enslave us.
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:10.880]  It's about control.
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:12.880]  They're criminals.
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:17.880]  In this new year, 2005 coming up, we're probably going to see globalist terror attacks
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:21.880]  to bring in national drafts in police state.
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:23.880]  We're going to see an implementation of the National ID card to the grammar license.
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:27.880]  We're going to see the new freedom initiative as they try to push that for psychological testing and drugging.
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:30.880]  We have got to wake everybody up and say no.
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:32.880]  We got to support those that tell the truth.
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:37.880]  We've all got to become info warriors and stand up against this new world order.
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:41.880]  The interview you heard with Dr. Rocky will re-air tonight at 9 to midnight central
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:43.880]  and several times over the weekend.
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:47.880]  Please tell your friends about this.
