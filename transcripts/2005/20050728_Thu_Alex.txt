[00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:06.215]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:07.916]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:09.756]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:13.278]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.538 --> 00:00:17.419]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:21.821]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.115]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:41.737]  It is the 27th day of June 2005.
[00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:45.098]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:46.998]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:57.201]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we have prolific 9-11 researcher and journalist coming on the broadcast.
[00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.272]  Greg Zeminsky.
[00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:14.038]  Then, 30 minutes after that, starting in the second hour, we're going to have janitor, maintenance man, William Rodriguez, who was there at the site on 9-11 and reported the bombs, and like many others, was told to shut up.
[00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:26.842]  And then in the middle of the next hour, an hour and a half from now, we're going to be joined by Paul Craig Roberts, who was former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan's administration.
[00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:35.009]  Talking about his questions of the official story of 9-11 smelling a gigantic, stinking rat.
[00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:44.815]  And masses of news mixed in, in the meantime, and of course in the next 30 minutes before we go to these important guests.
[00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:51.720]  And I have several announcements, one of them extremely important, coming up after this first break.
[00:01:53.732 --> 00:02:03.299]  I will just tell you now that fellow Patriot broadcaster on another network, John Stantmiller, Friday night was in a very bad motorcycle accident.
[00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.305]  I talked to his wife this morning, I just learned of it, earlier today, and she was very busy and I was about to have to go on the air.
[00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:17.570]  I got a hold of her right before I went on the air, and she gave me the details of John's motorcycle accident.
[00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.852]  But he's doing okay.
[00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.354]  The injuries were significant.
[00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:30.907]  And, uh, prolific across his, uh, body, and we will give you the details of that directly from his wife, who saw the accident.
[00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:35.171]  She was behind him, uh, as they were driving, and he had the accident.
[00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:39.054]  Alright, so we will give you details of that as well.
[00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:41.516]  There's been an election in Iran.
[00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:44.578]  There is a ton of news coming out of Iraq.
[00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:47.901]  Bush's approval numbers are slipping even further, if that's possible.
[00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.144]  I mean, the high 20s is record low for a president.
[00:02:53.198 --> 00:02:57.541]  LBJ had numbers higher than that when he didn't run for re-election.
[00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:11.288]  And Bill Clinton's approval rating hit 33%, and then we had the Oklahoma City bombing, and a year later on Air Force One, in 96, he said, I owe my political resurrection to the OKC bombing.
[00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.591]  And we know you do, Bill Clinton, because your people were behind it.
[00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:25.135]  And of course now you vacation and basically live with the Bushes and you're a surrogate son and Barbara calls you her son.
[00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:29.537]  And Hillary is hanging out professionally with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.799]  It's all completely staged.
[00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.561]  So we'll get into that as well as more and more news comes out on this.
[00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:39.202]  It's like Mary Madeline married to Carvel.
[00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:40.543]  And they're both strategists.
[00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:42.824]  One for the Republicans, one for the Democrats.
[00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:44.704]  It's staged, folks.
[00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:48.145]  It's a business of giving you a false choice.
[00:03:48.205 --> 00:04:09.971]  Well, we shatter that false choice here, ladies and gentlemen, and open up the entire spectrum of reality, Monday through Friday, from 11 until 2, Central Standard Time, and then back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time, right here on the GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.176]  Now going out on over 300 affiliates.
[00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:15.439]  No, not my broadcast.
[00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.759]  It's on about 80 affiliates.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.223]  But if you count all the stations this wonderful network has gotten, over 300 affiliates.
[00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:26.405]  And I can only commend Ted Anderson for his great work and his leadership.
[00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:29.647]  And I can only commend the great staff of the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:36.951]  And I can finally, most importantly, thank God for blessing us and leading and guiding and directing us.
[00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:40.994]  And of course, the listeners and the station owners, the sponsors, everyone.
[00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:51.646]  We are reaching millions and millions of people every day with the voice of truth, with the message that the New World Order is evil and must be defeated.
[00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:55.950]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:57.172]  We'll be right back!
[00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:08.285]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.605 --> 00:05:09.965]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:12.386]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:14.606]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.887 --> 00:05:19.808]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.148 --> 00:05:24.189]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.230]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:36.935]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.996]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:43.038]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.
[00:05:43.158 --> 00:05:44.579]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.799]  That's 888-2533139.

[00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.211]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:06.709]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:11.150]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.990]  We listened.
[00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:17.272]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:18.032]  We listened.
[00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:21.453]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.873 --> 00:06:22.413]  We listened.
[00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:26.034]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:06:26.294 --> 00:06:26.834]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:53.768]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.213]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.430]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.533]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:08.653]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:13.236]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:17.639]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.883]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.263 --> 00:07:26.845]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:32.369]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.371]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:36.572]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.872 --> 00:07:47.599]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:08:02.704 --> 00:08:08.726]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:12.387]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.268 --> 00:08:16.429]  About two months ago,
[00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:28.880]  Just days after he got back from Germany at the Bilderberg Group meeting, Jim Tucker of American Free Press reported that they had multiple witnesses inside the elite meeting.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.602]  The heads of banking, the heads of the royal families, the heads of the Fortune 500.
[00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.592]  That they plan to double oil prices in the next 12 months.
[00:08:39.732 --> 00:08:41.713]  Since then, oil has exploded.
[00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:49.256]  And now, in the last week, we have seen a flurry of Financial Times, of London articles, Reuters articles, you name it.
[00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:54.498]  All these big experts saying, we could see a doubling in oil prices.
[00:08:54.518 --> 00:08:56.259]  And again, they're staging it.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.200]  They put out this story, well, there's no more oil.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.961]  The oil companies are putting that report out.
[00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:08.381]  But then they add another layer to it, that it's being caused by all the unrest in the world, or it's being caused by the refineries.
[00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:14.425]  Even if we're going to run out of oil in 50 years, which isn't true, the evidence shows, it wouldn't be causing a doubling right now.
[00:09:14.906 --> 00:09:23.512]  The oil companies are all registering record all-time profits in the last two years, just with the price increases we've already seen of around 70%.
[00:09:24.993 --> 00:09:32.620]  We'll now get ready for oil to go up to, some are talking about, Henry Kissinger's talking about, $150 a barrel.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.581]  It's insane!
[00:09:35.162 --> 00:09:36.624]  Rumsfeld suggests U.S.
[00:09:36.664 --> 00:09:38.826]  could be in Iraq for 12 more years.
[00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:40.727]  We will go over that report.
[00:09:40.807 --> 00:09:42.789]  Again, unrest could double oil prices.
[00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.831]  London Telegraph.
[00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:56.551]  Coming up, we will speak with Ground Zero hero, Janitor William Rodriguez, who reported on explosions coming from below the first sublevel while working in the basement of the World Trade Center complex.
[00:09:57.365 --> 00:10:03.611]  Then we'll interview former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts, who doubts the official 9-11 story.
[00:10:04.031 --> 00:10:14.240]  And of course, coming up in about 20 minutes to introduce these important topics to us and these guests, 9-1-1 prolific researcher and journalist, Greg Zeminski.
[00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:19.285]  So absolutely jam-packed information today.
[00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:23.288]  That's just some of what is coming up.
[00:10:23.308 --> 00:10:27.331]  I'm about to plunge into the other news items before we get these guests on.
[00:10:28.632 --> 00:10:41.003]  But before I go any further, John Stattmiller, long-time Patriot broadcaster, of course co-host with Mark Kornke, one of the things he's done that's better known, who has his own Patriot radio network,
[00:10:42.515 --> 00:10:47.617]  Friday night was in a very serious motorcycle accident.
[00:10:47.677 --> 00:10:48.957]  I just learned of it this morning.
[00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:56.199]  I got a hold of Sanders Scott Miller, his wife, and she told me that it is not foul played.
[00:10:56.619 --> 00:10:58.140]  She was right behind him.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.821]  People said that with Clay Douglas too.
[00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.881]  He had his motorcycle accident a year and a half ago.
[00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:05.622]  Somebody pulled out in front of him.
[00:11:07.018 --> 00:11:13.828]  But what happened with John Stadtmiller, according to his wife Sandra, is they were driving and the highway cut down to just one lane.
[00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:18.375]  It was a construction and that there was gravel on the road and that he slid out.
[00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:19.448]  I don't think so.
[00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:50.547]  Breckenridge Hospital in downtown Austin and I'm told he called into a talk show today so he's doing better.
[00:11:50.987 --> 00:11:57.272]  Obviously in a lot of pain so we should all pray for John and of course we know he will get better.
[00:11:58.573 --> 00:12:03.036]  Personally, you know my uncle had a motorcycle accident.
[00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.518]  He was probably going to be a professional baseball player.
[00:12:05.538 --> 00:12:06.879]  He already had scouts looking at him.
[00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:07.880]  I mean he was
[00:12:09.364 --> 00:12:10.645]  Incredibly good.
[00:12:10.665 --> 00:12:12.846]  Everybody says they're good at baseball when you play baseball.
[00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:21.450]  He was a really good pitcher, really good hitter, and when he was 16, they already had a bunch of colleges wanting to give him full scholarships.
[00:12:23.311 --> 00:12:25.212]  This was a long time ago, back in the 60s.
[00:12:26.592 --> 00:12:31.055]  He begged and pleaded and threw fits.
[00:12:31.155 --> 00:12:33.636]  My grandmother argued with my grandfather.
[00:12:34.776 --> 00:13:00.602]  and demanded that they give him the motorcycle that he had saved money for for three years and they bought him, he bought a motorcycle when he was 16 and a car pulled out in front of him when he was going 50 miles an hour and literally his brain was out part of his brain was outside of his skull and a large portion of his brain was removed and I know so many people chewed up
[00:13:02.053 --> 00:13:23.937]  uh... because of motorcycles and I don't know why anybody I mean I haven't talked about this on air but I frankly am sick of motorcycles my children over my dead body they will never have a motorcycle they will never drive a motorcycle they will never be around a motorcycle uh... my dad bought me a moped uh... and uh...
[00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:34.198]  I have no idea why he let me have a moped, though I saved the money for it.
[00:13:34.979 --> 00:13:35.500]  I'm sorry.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.467]  I'm a controlling parent and until they're 18 and leave my house, they are never going to have motorcycles.
[00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:50.928]  The problem with a motorcycle is you've got two wheels, and if you hit dirt, if you hit gravel, even if you're doing everything right, you might have a big wreck.
[00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:53.530]  And then there's all those cars flying around you.
[00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.052]  I mean, you know my story about cars.
[00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:03.056]  People are worried about the New World Order coming and getting.
[00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:06.859]  People are worried about all these primordial fears.
[00:14:07.904 --> 00:14:11.527]  Well, the number one cause of death in this country is transportation.
[00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:14.650]  And the subgroup of that is bigger than all the others put together.
[00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.673]  Just automobile accidents alone is the number one cause of death.
[00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:20.475]  And then you look at transportation itself.
[00:14:21.676 --> 00:14:26.840]  Helicopters, small planes, trains, but mainly cars.
[00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:28.942]  They're the most dangerous.
[00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:29.963]  I mean, look at
[00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:34.000]  Look at Jimmy Vaughn, great patriot here in Central Texas.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.764]  He lost his brother in a helicopter crash.
[00:14:36.784 --> 00:14:37.485]  Stevie Ray Vaughn.
[00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:39.948]  I mean, it's just... And you know what?
[00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:41.911]  We all decide to still travel.
[00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:45.616]  We all decide to continue to use these vehicles.
[00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:50.816]  So why don't we decide to step up to the plate and fight the New World Order?
[00:14:50.876 --> 00:15:00.704]  It's a lot safer to fight the New World Order to get in your car every day, but you still get in the car, you still put your family in the car, you still put your babies in the car, and you still take that risk.
[00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.405]  Number one cause of death.
[00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:04.006]  Until you're 55.
[00:15:04.066 --> 00:15:06.128]  Then it is eclipsed by heart attacks and cancer.
[00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:10.331]  So, and you know I've talked a lot about that.
[00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:15.275]  I mean, it's the parallel between perceived fears and what you should really be afraid of.
[00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:24.128]  You know, a year and a half ago, I was hit by a tornado driving back from Zink Family in Fredericksburg, coming into Johnson City.
[00:15:24.568 --> 00:15:31.871]  Tornado just threw us right off the road, and if the oak trees wouldn't have hit the back of the Tahoe, my father and I would have been dead.
[00:15:32.472 --> 00:15:34.552]  I mean, they crushed like five feet of the vehicle in.
[00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:36.333]  The state police couldn't believe it.
[00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:37.694]  I mean, the thing was devastated.
[00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:42.856]  That's why I bought a Tourig, because it's the safest SUV out there.
[00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.539]  I mean, that's what I go for, is safety.
[00:15:48.810 --> 00:16:17.100]  uh... now and they know it's well worth even spending more money that's the problem with cheap cars cheap vehicles is that they do not have the titanium steel cages and then nothing is more important than your family so if you got the money spend a hundred dollars more a month on your car payment and get rid of these cars that aren't safe and I'll tell you I mean a Tahoe compared to some of these other foreign cars is and I've never owned a foreign car now that's all I'll buy because American cars just are not safe
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.382]  Compared to foreign cars, in many cases.
[00:16:21.143 --> 00:16:27.127]  Now I'm really off in left field today, it's just that this is really a public service announcement.
[00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:34.613]  But getting back to the Terry Schiavo case, my uncle was in a coma for six weeks on life support.
[00:16:35.334 --> 00:16:36.515]  And they wanted to unplug him.
[00:16:37.295 --> 00:16:44.501]  And my grandmother, God rest her soul, just departed last year, she refused to unplug my uncle, JoLynn Jones.
[00:16:46.304 --> 00:16:51.726]  And my dad had to quit college for a while, go there and try to take care of him out in Fairfield, Texas, East Texas.
[00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:56.589]  And they were really wanting to unplug him, and my grandmother refused.
[00:16:57.209 --> 00:17:03.612]  And she was sitting there praying for him, and literally he just woke up out of the coma screaming, saying, Mama.
[00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:27.951]  So many people, and by the way, even though they removed part of his brain, today he has two happy children, happily married, very successful in ranching and farming and business, and other than occasionally he can't find the right word for something because part of his speech centers were removed, because he was young,
[00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:32.152]  I mean, literally, folks, he had a Darth Vader-style accident.
[00:17:32.172 --> 00:17:33.293]  You know, something that bad.
[00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:36.714]  So traumatic to his body that he was in pieces.
[00:17:37.314 --> 00:17:38.655]  Giant scars all over him.
[00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:41.996]  He looks like, when he takes his shirt off at the beach, he looks like Frankenstein.
[00:17:42.517 --> 00:17:44.017]  But he has a good life.
[00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:47.199]  You never know what God's going to do and what the human body's going to do.
[00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:51.760]  But thank God John Stadtmiller is not hurt, you know, one hundredth that bad.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:57.883]  He just has broken ribs and broken bones and a big, I believe she said the gashes on his head.
[00:17:59.318 --> 00:18:01.319]  About, uh, I think 11 stitches, she said.
[00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:06.683]  But, uh, so... He's doing good enough to call into a talk show this morning, so that is certainly good news.
[00:18:06.723 --> 00:18:10.906]  But, I just want all of you to think about how dangerous vehicles are.
[00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:14.629]  And to be conscious of it and to drive safe.
[00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:17.291]  Man, I had some idiot last night just pull out in front of me.
[00:18:17.331 --> 00:18:19.472]  I was going 50 miles an hour down a road.
[00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:20.953]  This person just pulled out in front of me.
[00:18:21.013 --> 00:18:22.194]  I screeched on my brakes.
[00:18:22.654 --> 00:18:25.196]  The anti-lock brakes cut in and stopped an accident.
[00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:27.718]  You've gotta be careful.
[00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:32.285]  And patriots are few and far between, though our numbers are growing.
[00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:34.687]  We've got to take care of ourselves.
[00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.249]  So I suggest hanging up the motorcycles.
[00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:43.653]  I mean, I told John a year ago, I remember telling him, man, you're crazy driving that motorcycle.
[00:18:44.394 --> 00:18:46.816]  I mean, you wouldn't catch me dead on one of those things.
[00:18:47.456 --> 00:18:48.757]  I mean, I'm not going to get near one.
[00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:54.441]  And I know, I'll get all these calls now by bikers, ah, shut up Alex, you're a wimp.
[00:18:55.282 --> 00:18:56.583]  Okay, I mean, I know people
[00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:02.834]  We've had tracheotomies who've had, like, fingers ripped off, and they still get on their hogs.
[00:19:02.914 --> 00:19:06.396]  They still get on their... And, uh, I'm sorry.
[00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:10.158]  I mean, it's crazy to get on these highways with people driving 80 miles an hour in a big truck.
[00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:16.042]  Uh, we still do it, but it just... it's hundreds of times more dangerous than these motorcycles.
[00:19:16.502 --> 00:19:20.184]  Okay, I've just spent an entire segment talking about transportation, but it is important.
[00:19:21.132 --> 00:19:21.692]  We'll get back.
[00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:23.253]  Rumsfeld suggests U.S.
[00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:24.874]  to be in Iraq 12 more years.
[00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:27.255]  They're talking now about oil prices doubling.
[00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:30.176]  And just so much more.
[00:19:30.196 --> 00:19:35.619]  And then all of these big new 9-11 developments coming up in 10 minutes.
[00:19:35.639 --> 00:19:40.501]  To be precise, T-minus 12 minutes after this, counting the next break.
[00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:44.723]  So when we get back, we will plunge into the news and we will take your calls.
[00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:49.195]  Don't forget InfoWars.net, one of my best websites.

[00:22:18.252 --> 00:22:20.613]  A 5% increase.
[00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:27.075]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[00:22:27.195 --> 00:22:30.416]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:22:31.157 --> 00:22:33.517]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.

[00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:10.608]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:13.730]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:20.677]  A couple news items that are exclusive to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I wish they weren't.
[00:24:20.837 --> 00:24:23.039]  Former MI5 agent says 911 an inside job.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.041]  We did that interview last week.
[00:24:26.061 --> 00:24:29.544]  A detail report was put together by Paul Watson predominantly with my input.
[00:24:30.065 --> 00:24:31.086]  Attack was coup d'etat.
[00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:33.128]  Buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:35.950]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.591]  I hope you'll get the word out to people.
[00:24:38.092 --> 00:24:39.653]  Another insider goes public.
[00:24:40.574 --> 00:24:41.475]  How many is that now?
[00:24:42.464 --> 00:24:50.048]  And also, last Friday we put together a detailed report concerning what really happened in New London, Connecticut.
[00:24:50.508 --> 00:25:02.695]  The harassment of the landowners, the homeowners, the bulldozers, revving, people having heart attacks under the stress, threatening people to sign over their land, saying they'll have to pay past rent on the land, even though they owned it because they fought in court.
[00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:06.255]  There's a total news blackout on it.
[00:25:06.415 --> 00:25:10.757]  And in the article we ask WorldNetDaily and Drudge and everybody else to report on it.
[00:25:11.258 --> 00:25:12.258]  They don't have to give us credit.
[00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:14.280]  They can call these same families up.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.961]  It's a big story.
[00:25:16.321 --> 00:25:17.722]  And get it in their publications.
[00:25:18.542 --> 00:25:19.483]  We don't want the credit.
[00:25:19.523 --> 00:25:20.864]  Just get the report out.
[00:25:21.624 --> 00:25:23.245]  And no one's posting it.
[00:25:23.746 --> 00:25:25.947]  I saw it on MacWhite.com's website.
[00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:26.808]  We appreciate that, Mac.
[00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:28.796]  I mean, no one's discussing it.
[00:25:29.176 --> 00:25:39.244]  Everybody just heard, oh, the Supreme Court says they can take it, not just for public works, but for if some corporation comes and offers more money for your property and says they'll pay more taxes, that they can take it.
[00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:47.710]  And I've got literally ten different, or more, reports from over the weekend where all these cities and states are saying they're going to take people's property now.
[00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:53.595]  It's a horrible ruling, but then people don't even know the basics of the story of what happened.
[00:25:54.361 --> 00:25:59.202]  Of how they condemn your house out of hand so they don't have to pay you the value of the house.
[00:25:59.222 --> 00:26:00.843]  We're not even talking about paying you the value.
[00:26:00.863 --> 00:26:03.984]  We're talking about, in these cases, a quarter of the value.
[00:26:04.524 --> 00:26:10.346]  We had one of the landowners on the broadcast that was quoted by the Associated Press and I also talked to three of the landowners off air.
[00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:15.067]  So I confirmed it with four different homeowners there and landowners.
[00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:17.655]  So this is what's going on.
[00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:19.795]  I mean, you talk about the Soviet Union, folks.
[00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:29.979]  This is like shades of, you know, the army running Native Americans off their property in the western parts of the country.
[00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:32.060]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:42.444]  And there is a news blackout on the David Shaler MI5 agent report that we put out, and there's a news blackout on this other one about what happened in New London, Connecticut.
[00:26:44.042 --> 00:26:50.425]  It is up to you listeners to get these reports out to all the blogs and all the different websites out there and say, hey, would you please call these people?
[00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:51.545]  Would you do your own report?
[00:26:51.925 --> 00:26:58.228]  If you won't post Alex Jones' report, Paul Watson's report, will you please help us get the truth out to fight this?
[00:26:58.628 --> 00:27:07.612]  If this story gets out, I mean, already 99% of the American people in a major poll on CNN are against the ruling, but the people will really be angry if they learn the truth!
[00:27:09.233 --> 00:27:12.454]  Literally, folks only know the tip of the iceberg here!
[00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:18.974]  It's now coming out that DoD-Iraq GI war dead figures are in dispute.
[00:27:20.114 --> 00:27:21.735]  Also, Rumsfeld suggests U.S.
[00:27:21.775 --> 00:27:23.275]  could be in Iraq for 12 more years.
[00:27:23.615 --> 00:27:26.536]  Well, the Pentagon said 10 to 20 when they invaded.
[00:27:26.636 --> 00:27:27.336]  I mean, that was public.
[00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:31.857]  Well, again, that was in their reports, but then nationally, we'll be there just a few months.
[00:27:32.637 --> 00:27:37.618]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said on Sunday it may take as long as 12 years to defeat Iraqi insurgents.
[00:27:38.298 --> 00:27:40.479]  Let me see if we're losing about 800 a year of our own troops.
[00:27:42.917 --> 00:27:45.039]  And about 100,000 Iraqis a year.
[00:27:45.859 --> 00:27:48.881]  We're looking at over 100,000 people, 12 years.
[00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:48.881]  1,200,000.
[00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:56.386]  That's over 1,200,000, with about 1.5 million died in the 13 years of sanctions.
[00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:59.628]  So, boy, that's liberation, folks.
[00:27:59.689 --> 00:28:02.590]  Rumsfeld addressing a question about whether U.S.
[00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.752]  troops' levels are adequate.
[00:28:05.569 --> 00:28:10.431]  To vanquish the insurgency, violent resistance said, we're not going to win against the insurgency.
[00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.693]  The Iraqi people are going to win against the insurgency.
[00:28:13.073 --> 00:28:16.214]  That insurgency could be going on for any number of years.
[00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:19.036]  Insurgents tend to go on 5, 6, 8, or 10, even 12 years, Rumsfeld said.
[00:28:22.057 --> 00:28:27.819]  Coalition troops, continuing his quote, uh, foreign forces are not going to, uh, repress that insurgency.
[00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:36.381]  The Pentagon chief told Fox News Sunday, we're going to create an environment where the Iraqi people and the Iraqi security forces can win against that insurgency, he said.
[00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:39.822]  Boy, that is not good news.
[00:28:39.882 --> 00:28:47.384]  Rumsfeld in interviews on Sunday news shows warned that the insurgency could grow through the years as the Iraqi leaders develop a coalition for a democratic government.
[00:28:47.604 --> 00:28:47.784]  Uh-huh.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.001]  And another scary article here out of the London Telegraph.
[00:28:53.522 --> 00:28:54.843]  That one was out of News 24.
[00:28:55.683 --> 00:28:58.804]  This is unrest could double oil prices.
[00:28:59.365 --> 00:29:01.606]  A warning of a possible near doubling.
[00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:09.349]  And the cost of oil was issued yesterday as UK prices rose to more than four pounds or about seven and a half dollars a gallon.
[00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:11.870]  And the AA Motoring Trust
[00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:39.866]  said that the price of diesel was approaching five pounds a gallon or over eight dollars a gallon further rises were expected next week it said the price of crude oil could soon reach $100 a barrel as Lord Kissinger said we learned this two months ago compared with the present historic high of $60 if there was any further supply disruption in Russia or a political upset in Saudi Arabia a leading German institute said
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:47.364]  All right, we've got Gretchen Minsky coming on, and we have Mr. Rodriguez, and then Mr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:29:47.484 --> 00:29:48.244]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.604 --> 00:29:49.785]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:51.546 --> 00:29:52.487]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.947 --> 00:29:54.548]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.468 --> 00:29:58.150]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.862 --> 00:30:06.488]  Yes, there is a choice, a real alternative when it comes to news and information.

[00:30:41.618 --> 00:30:42.558]  There is an alternative.
[00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:44.439]  And it's called GCNLive.com.

[00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:06.824]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.984 --> 00:31:15.071]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:22.377]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.557 --> 00:31:23.837]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:31:23.917 --> 00:31:29.819]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:35.080]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:44.083]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.343 --> 00:31:51.205]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[00:32:05.376 --> 00:32:06.257]  Look no further!
[00:32:06.537 --> 00:32:09.119]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:17.967]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:32:18.387 --> 00:32:18.667]  I think so.
[00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:36.208]  I don't know.
[00:33:09.277 --> 00:33:16.128]  All right, prolific journalist and researcher Greg Zemecki is going to be joining us here in about a minute and a half.
[00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.613]  Talk about the latest 9-11 developments.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:37.732]  We'll also talk to Ground Zero Hero, Janitor William Rodriguez, who reported on explosions coming from below the first sublevel while working in the basement, and then coming up the middle of the next hour, Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan, who now doubts the official 9-11 story as well.
[00:33:37.772 --> 00:33:39.293]  That's the three great guests today.
[00:33:41.014 --> 00:33:49.100]  Another note here, as of last night, actually as of yesterday afternoon, I haven't had time to call and check since then,
[00:33:49.887 --> 00:33:55.069]  So there are probably no tickets left, but I haven't called and checked yet, so there might be one or two.
[00:33:55.129 --> 00:33:55.829]  I have no idea.
[00:33:56.189 --> 00:34:06.292]  Go to Infowars.com, link through to the Alamo Draft House Cinema, where they have food and everything, but a really nice movie theater on South Lamar, and you can try to get tickets.
[00:34:06.572 --> 00:34:15.875]  It'll tell you if it's sold out, or it should be up there if it's sold out, but you can go to their website and buy tickets there right now for tonight's showing.
[00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.631]  All of these have sold out before opening day.
[00:34:18.672 --> 00:34:19.972]  Some of them a week and a half before.
[00:34:20.033 --> 00:34:21.834]  So, I guess the sixth showing.
[00:34:22.214 --> 00:34:25.517]  We're beginning to get near the end of the overflow audiences.
[00:34:25.537 --> 00:34:27.198]  I could probably do one or two more that would sell out.
[00:34:27.238 --> 00:34:29.419]  But this is the last showing tonight.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.881]  At least for the next three or four months.
[00:34:31.961 --> 00:34:35.124]  We may do a big outdoor showing where we can have like a couple thousand people.
[00:34:35.144 --> 00:34:37.565]  They have a big screen they can put up outside anywhere.
[00:34:37.585 --> 00:34:40.247]  But we have to wait until it cools off to do that.
[00:34:40.628 --> 00:34:42.089]  So we'll probably do that in the fall.
[00:34:44.028 --> 00:34:51.072]  Not much of an announcement either, because I don't want to have people come out when it's raining or something, but go to InfoWars.com.
[00:34:51.792 --> 00:34:53.653]  Find out why people love this film.
[00:34:53.713 --> 00:34:55.034]  I mean, it is my best work.
[00:34:55.094 --> 00:34:58.535]  It covers who was behind 9-11, how the globalists carried it out.
[00:34:58.575 --> 00:35:02.978]  It covers the police state they're setting up and how they're using 9-11 for that police state.
[00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:09.921]  Then it examines the Bush-Nazi connection, the Schwarzenegger-Nazi connection, the Bohemian Grove-Skull and Bones connection to all of that.
[00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.202]  Three hours long.
[00:35:12.262 --> 00:35:13.143]  It's a mini-series.
[00:35:14.289 --> 00:35:18.391]  I mean, I know movie directors that have seen this film, and they're like, Alex, you've got to call this a miniseries.
[00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:19.632]  And that's why I started calling it that.
[00:35:19.692 --> 00:35:20.232]  Really, it is.
[00:35:21.493 --> 00:35:22.554]  Three separate films.
[00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:24.475]  So, it's $25.95.
[00:35:26.596 --> 00:35:28.457]  Three hours, a little over three hours long.
[00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:30.939]  On VHS, it's two hours, thirty-five minutes.
[00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:35.882]  The main film itself is two hours, thirty-five minutes long, and the extras are about twenty-six minutes long.
[00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:39.103]  So, we're looking at right around three hours and one minute long.
[00:35:39.544 --> 00:35:40.624]  It is so good.
[00:35:40.644 --> 00:35:41.805]  It is my best work.
[00:35:42.025 --> 00:35:43.306]  Heads, shoulders,
[00:35:44.355 --> 00:35:47.739]  Above my other films that a lot of people really like and I think are excellent.
[00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:58.250]  And if you like martial law, say you've gotten it, get Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Police State 3, Total Enslavement, get Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove, get American Dictators.
[00:36:00.345 --> 00:36:04.288]  Upwards of 75% off on some of my films.
[00:36:04.348 --> 00:36:06.329]  We have some amazing discounts.
[00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:10.271]  So when you call, be sure and ask about them.
[00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:14.214]  1-888-253-3139 to get your questions answered.
[00:36:14.234 --> 00:36:15.114]  4 to order.
[00:36:15.234 --> 00:36:16.515]  No pressure to buy anything when you call.

[00:36:17.396 --> 00:36:17.456]  1-888-253-3139.

[00:36:29.006 --> 00:36:32.648]  I have a whole bookstore on there of other great books and videos I carry about other great researchers.

[00:37:23.827 --> 00:37:30.450]  Let's now go to our guest, and I'll tell you, he just breaks news story after news story on a daily basis.
[00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:35.432]  He's becoming, frankly, the most prolific writer on the web right now.
[00:37:35.693 --> 00:37:37.413]  He has just exploded out of the gates.
[00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:40.275]  He's been writing for years, but he's really on target.
[00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:45.175]  And just joining us again, Greg, thanks for coming on.
[00:37:45.656 --> 00:37:46.496]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[00:37:47.037 --> 00:37:48.097]  Thanks for the introduction.
[00:37:48.457 --> 00:37:49.618]  Oh, you bet.
[00:37:49.758 --> 00:37:57.883]  Let's just start off with former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, then let's go into one of the janitors.
[00:37:57.923 --> 00:38:01.165]  And I've called some of these people in the years past who reported bombs.
[00:38:01.205 --> 00:38:04.487]  They've said, I've been told to shut up, firefighters, workers, others.
[00:38:05.328 --> 00:38:14.579]  Well, you know, Paul Craig Roberts is a very, very interesting man, a very intelligent man, a person that I enjoy talking to and basically enlightened me about his feelings.
[00:38:25.114 --> 00:38:32.919]  His interesting story is, I believe, and he said to me this, he said, Greg, you know, why don't you look at all these Republican defections?
[00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:34.559]  You know, that's a great story.
[00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:44.165]  There's a lot of people like me who are influential in the government, who have just basically been either shunned in Washington by the neocons or basically kicked out.
[00:38:44.185 --> 00:38:46.906]  And Paul's a great example.
[00:38:47.207 --> 00:38:47.487]  I mean,
[00:38:48.087 --> 00:38:49.068]  Listen to his story.
[00:38:49.108 --> 00:38:51.709]  He was back in the old days with Reagan.
[00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:59.234]  He was a Businessweek writer and also an assistant editor for Wall Street Journal, and many of his articles were hated by the liberals.
[00:39:00.375 --> 00:39:10.221]  So Paul, over the years, basically started his own... He syndicates a column which is very anti-Bush and very anti-Neocon.
[00:39:11.031 --> 00:39:16.396]  And, uh, he basically tells me it's very difficult to get anything published in the mainstream.
[00:39:16.416 --> 00:39:23.122]  Yeah, even the so-called... Even Paul, I mean, can't get things contrary to the administration or contrary to Bush.
[00:39:23.843 --> 00:39:24.724]  Well, I mean, that's the point.
[00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:31.790]  Even so-called liberal papers will only publish stupid, shallow, fake liberal arguments against Bush.
[00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.973]  They'll never let somebody come in with the real arguments.
[00:39:35.453 --> 00:39:40.018]  Yeah, Paul is a person whose opinions are respected.
[00:39:40.358 --> 00:39:41.740]  He knows people in the business.
[00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:50.716]  And he basically was basically hated by the liberals way back when, and now, I mean, look at the irony of the situation.
[00:39:51.096 --> 00:39:54.959]  And when you have him on in the next hour, he'll be able to explain it better than me.
[00:39:55.379 --> 00:39:58.962]  All I can say is basically he's a very interesting person.
[00:39:59.222 --> 00:40:00.143]  I love talking to him.
[00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:01.664]  He's got some great views.
[00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:06.348]  And it's just a shame that his views can't be heard by the heartland of America.
[00:40:06.368 --> 00:40:10.011]  Well, in your article you quote him, and he talks about how, I've never changed.
[00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:11.572]  I'm still a conservative.
[00:40:11.852 --> 00:40:13.373]  The neocons are the opposite.
[00:40:13.533 --> 00:40:19.616]  And I've told real liberals, real democrats that love big government and all this, I've said you should love George Bush!
[00:40:20.196 --> 00:40:26.479]  I mean, the biggest government ever, expanding all these welfare programs that are really just corporate welfare to control our lives.
[00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:30.701]  I mean, Ron Paul gave that speech two years ago called Neocon.
[00:40:31.201 --> 00:40:45.142]  Where he laid out how the 4th International, the Trotskyites, literally, the head of the 4th International, founded neoconism and the other guy, Leon Strauss out of Chicago at the Economics University, I mean, he's an adherent of fascism!
[00:40:45.999 --> 00:40:53.643]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the real story, and basically, you know, kind of so people understand, you know, what's going on.
[00:40:54.843 --> 00:41:05.769]  My background, years ago, when I was an editor of my college newspaper, and I should add, we had to start another one because the college newspaper was funded by the university, and the op-ed has been kind of controlled stories.
[00:41:06.149 --> 00:41:09.290]  My whole idea back then, even then, it was just instinctive.
[00:41:10.171 --> 00:41:14.273]  You know, I wanted to get the voices of people that never get heard into the newspaper.
[00:41:14.873 --> 00:41:24.756]  And I did that at my college and basically it accelerated my graduation when I discovered that the college president was using funds from the university to build this mansion.
[00:41:25.476 --> 00:41:27.536]  So back then, nothing's changed for me.
[00:41:27.556 --> 00:41:28.637]  I've always been the same.
[00:41:29.637 --> 00:41:35.819]  Stories of interest are those that never get in the paper and so when you have a nose for news,
[00:41:37.688 --> 00:41:45.052]  Years ago I got out of journalism and 9-11 kind of pulled me back into it because basically I said, you know something, this is needed.
[00:41:45.092 --> 00:41:54.176]  People need to see something in a newspaper by a writer who knows how to write for the newspapers, knows their style, knows what they want, but you can't get it in.
[00:41:54.817 --> 00:41:58.138]  So basically I just started doing it the only way I could.
[00:41:58.218 --> 00:42:02.220]  It's pulled me away from most everything in my life and I think it's a worthwhile cause.
[00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:07.163]  I'm not going to stop until all these people like Rodriguez are heard.
[00:42:08.112 --> 00:42:09.994]  By the way, we're going to get into him in a second.
[00:42:10.014 --> 00:42:17.239]  You also write for American Free Press and a bunch of other prominent alternative publications.
[00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:21.162]  Let's get into one of the heroes of 9-11.
[00:42:21.222 --> 00:42:23.724]  I'd heard his name before, but I could never get a hold of these individuals.
[00:42:24.085 --> 00:42:27.948]  How you got a hold of the maintenance man, Janitor William Rodriguez?
[00:42:28.548 --> 00:42:31.030]  Who reported on explosions coming from below.
[00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:37.174]  And he's not, literally folks, there's hundreds that reported this, but he's one of the folks that's willing to go public.
[00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:38.475]  Tell us about this guy.
[00:42:38.775 --> 00:42:40.016]  Well, let me tell you about William.
[00:42:40.036 --> 00:42:40.977]  He's very sincere.
[00:42:40.997 --> 00:42:43.699]  And he's very credible.
[00:42:44.239 --> 00:42:57.769]  And the reason I say that is when William is kind of, throughout the years, he's been approached by many people, including news reporters from the biggest, from the mainstream, who've kind of hinted, William, you know, you better keep quiet about this because you don't know who you're dealing with.
[00:42:58.482 --> 00:43:05.044]  And William told me, and I'm sure he'll tell you the same thing, that he's never varied his story from day one, when the planes hit.
[00:43:05.924 --> 00:43:09.905]  And he looks them in the eye and says, you know, I have nothing to lose.
[00:43:09.925 --> 00:43:12.206]  I should probably be dead now.
[00:43:12.466 --> 00:43:15.287]  And I am now the voice of 200 of my friends who died.
[00:43:15.307 --> 00:43:18.348]  And all I want to do is get the truth out.
[00:43:18.768 --> 00:43:22.649]  Well, William has not been able to do that here in America.
[00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:26.281]  And I can tell you exactly what happened.
[00:43:26.341 --> 00:43:27.462]  Well, I'll tell you a story.
[00:43:27.903 --> 00:43:41.133]  Lou Cacioli, a 50-plus year old senior firefighter, head of a whole ladder, he told People Magazine that clearly bombs were going off and he was trapped in there before they collapsed.
[00:43:41.853 --> 00:43:44.756]  And then I called, talked to his wife, briefly talked to him, and he just said,
[00:43:45.606 --> 00:43:46.667]  I've been told to shut up.
[00:43:46.727 --> 00:43:47.768]  I'm not doing interviews.
[00:43:47.788 --> 00:43:48.228]  Exactly.
[00:43:48.548 --> 00:43:49.689]  So it's the same M.O.
[00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:50.410]  over and over again.
[00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:54.473]  Oh yeah, but listen, let me just talk specifically about... Yeah, let's talk about his story.
[00:43:54.493 --> 00:43:55.574]  He's coming on in 20 minutes.
[00:43:55.954 --> 00:43:56.274]  What's that?
[00:43:57.015 --> 00:44:00.278]  Of course, Mr. Rodriguez will be joining us in 20 minutes, but tell us his story.
[00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:04.601]  Yeah, you know, I'll tell you and he can talk about it also.
[00:44:05.141 --> 00:44:07.023]  But let me tell you how I heard about William.
[00:44:07.203 --> 00:44:13.028]  He's a lead plaintiff in a RICO lawsuit filed in Philadelphia last November.
[00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:14.529]  That's by Attorney Phil Berg.
[00:44:15.429 --> 00:44:18.312]  Recently the case, the government made a motion to dismiss.
[00:44:18.392 --> 00:44:20.393]  The judge ruled against the government.
[00:44:20.413 --> 00:44:22.815]  The case is now being moved to New York, a change of venue.
[00:44:23.275 --> 00:44:24.877]  And the case goes on, a legal discovery.
[00:44:24.917 --> 00:44:30.421]  Well, William, I've written about, I've talked to Phil about William since last November when the lawsuit hit.
[00:44:30.841 --> 00:44:34.704]  And I never really pushed the subject of really forcing William to go forward.
[00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:38.047]  He spends a lot of time in Europe getting his story across.
[00:44:38.687 --> 00:44:45.253]  And so I just let the story progress, and in several stories of mine you'll see I refer to William's name and the comments he made to Phil.
[00:44:46.614 --> 00:44:54.261]  However, in a recent story I ran, William contacted me and asked me if I'd like to speak about it.
[00:44:54.501 --> 00:44:56.542]  And I asked him, you know, can I talk to you?
[00:44:56.563 --> 00:44:58.304]  So we began speaking on the phone.
[00:44:59.125 --> 00:45:05.110]  And what came of this to me, when I got off the phone, I said, my God, why would
[00:45:05.735 --> 00:45:06.495]  NBC News.
[00:45:06.936 --> 00:45:08.736]  Why would all these other news agencies?
[00:45:08.776 --> 00:45:09.977]  This isn't a news story.
[00:45:10.017 --> 00:45:16.379]  I mean, if you're a journalist, three years ago, trying to get this story out, you're not going out on a journalistic limb.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.020]  Because let me tell you why.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.582]  William, I thought maybe William just heard explosions, but William came to work late.
[00:45:23.622 --> 00:45:28.364]  He goes down into his base, instead of being up above where he normally would be, he came to work late.
[00:45:28.424 --> 00:45:31.765]  He was down below in sub-level one in an office with 14 people.
[00:45:34.074 --> 00:45:43.920]  Now, when the bomb went off under his feet, he said he felt the floor shaking, the walls around him cracking, and of course, all these 14 people were frightened.
[00:45:44.621 --> 00:45:47.322]  Seconds later, he hears an explosion from way above.
[00:45:47.923 --> 00:45:50.224]  Not knowing it's an airplane, he doesn't know what it is.
[00:45:50.384 --> 00:46:01.671]  However, immediately after that, a man by the name of Felipe David comes running in, burnt to a crisp, skin hanging from his arms,
[00:46:02.319 --> 00:46:07.083]  In his hands, his face completely burnt, screaming, explosion, explosion, explosion.
[00:46:07.383 --> 00:46:15.329]  So for those that don't understand, there's an explosion right before, is what I'm getting, right before the plane even hits.
[00:46:15.389 --> 00:46:16.370]  They're down in the basement.
[00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.251]  Right, they hear that explosion from below.
[00:46:18.351 --> 00:46:24.556]  Totally far away from where any fire or the plane hitting, you know, 70-something stories up could hurt them.
[00:46:24.656 --> 00:46:25.236]  Impossible.
[00:46:25.276 --> 00:46:27.358]  So this guy's got skin hanging off of
[00:46:27.578 --> 00:46:28.458]  He's been on an explosion.
[00:46:28.598 --> 00:46:30.079]  Well, let me tell you where David was at.
[00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:42.242]  David was at an elevator shaft, a freight elevator shaft, about three or four hundred feet away, and says the flames came from, came shooting up, and burnt him to a crisp.
[00:46:42.282 --> 00:46:46.583]  So he runs to the nearest office, and fourteen people witness this.
[00:46:47.489 --> 00:46:50.391]  Witness Rod, you know, Rodriguez, then takes him out.
[00:46:50.712 --> 00:46:52.293]  Where is the fellow you just mentioned?
[00:46:52.793 --> 00:46:54.955]  Well, here's the story, and this is what William says.
[00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:57.957]  And let me get, you know, I'll explain this really quickly.
[00:46:58.317 --> 00:47:01.400]  Right after 9-11, a lot of stories appeared.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.380]  A couple of comments.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.983]  William's story, I think, got in some places just quickly.
[00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:09.966]  But see, what happened was, everything was forgotten about then.
[00:47:10.006 --> 00:47:12.248]  A lot of these people who were talking then,
[00:47:13.388 --> 00:47:15.270]  Three years later are difficult to find.
[00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:19.934]  I have a bunch of phone numbers and most of the numbers are disconnected from the people.
[00:47:20.534 --> 00:47:24.258]  It's going to take getting out there and finding them.
[00:47:24.698 --> 00:47:26.179]  William has trouble finding some of them.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.862]  Right after 9-11, I called quite a few of these people.
[00:47:28.882 --> 00:47:32.625]  I probably got a hold of about five different people, two of them firefighters.
[00:47:32.985 --> 00:47:34.807]  They just said, look, we've been told to shut up.
[00:47:34.847 --> 00:47:35.608]  That was universal.
[00:47:35.888 --> 00:47:36.328]  Exactly.
[00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:39.989]  And you know, during that time, there was a different atmosphere.
[00:47:40.009 --> 00:47:43.230]  And the atmosphere basically... Worship the government, believe the story.
[00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:43.850]  Sure.
[00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:45.191]  Nobody knew.
[00:47:46.311 --> 00:47:48.752]  But years later, what happened, though, is interesting.
[00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:53.513]  As we move this story along, which never really gets covered thoroughly in the press,
[00:47:54.233 --> 00:47:55.734]  We get to the 9-11 Commission.
[00:47:56.075 --> 00:48:04.761]  Now, as you know, the 9-11 Commission has ignored many people's comments, many even of the victims and the people involved, when they come to their scientific conclusions.
[00:48:04.821 --> 00:48:07.303]  And I put that word, scientific conclusions, in quotes.
[00:48:08.384 --> 00:48:18.812]  Because what there basically happened here, Rodriguez also was very forthright, wanted to talk to the 9-11 Commission, wanted to talk to the FBI, wanted, and he'll explain this.
[00:48:19.193 --> 00:48:21.214]  Well, anyway, I believe the 9-11 Commission
[00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:28.033]  I talked to other people who, for example, had found the black boxes, things like that, that were totally ignored.
[00:48:28.053 --> 00:48:35.635]  But I think because of Rodriguez's position, because of what he did on 9-11, because of the collaboration of 14 people with him, they had to deal with him somehow.
[00:48:36.276 --> 00:48:39.657]  So they pulled him in and said, we'll talk to you, but behind closed doors.
[00:48:40.237 --> 00:48:42.778]  So Rodriguez was kind of intimidated to keep quiet.
[00:48:43.298 --> 00:48:49.160]  Well, anyway, at the time, NBC News got wind of this, and also CNN, which I just found out.
[00:48:50.249 --> 00:48:58.452]  And they sent a news crew, and I've got email verifications of this, a news crew, out to his house for a complete day, right after these 9-11 hearings.
[00:48:58.512 --> 00:49:04.714]  Now, Rodriguez is kind of quiet, says a few things to a paper, but doesn't get into his story, because I think what happened, and you can verify this with him,
[00:49:05.895 --> 00:49:07.516]  Uh, they were telling him to keep quiet.
[00:49:07.996 --> 00:49:16.983]  Uh, we need to talk and discuss this and get... But, basically, 9-11 Commission never uses his, uh, uh, words to justify... Well, it's classic.
[00:49:17.003 --> 00:49:21.667]  They go, this is national security, we're gonna use this, but keep quiet for a few months... Right.
[00:49:21.947 --> 00:49:22.648]  ...while we track it down.
[00:49:22.668 --> 00:49:25.090]  The real key to this thing comes... NBC News gets wind of it.
[00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.311]  And they send a crew out, all day.
[00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:30.312]  And they sit with Rodriguez, uh, William, the whole day.
[00:49:30.752 --> 00:49:32.653]  They tape him for a complete day.
[00:49:32.753 --> 00:49:45.477]  All his, everything he said to me, everything he's, uh, uh, said to other people, like, uh, overseas in Puerto Rico and Telemundo and all these, uh, overseas, uh, uh, news broadcasts that are covering his story and, and let him talk uncensored.
[00:49:45.837 --> 00:49:52.740]  Well, anyway, they, they, they get all this tape and all his words, but they take it back and not a word of it ever appears.
[00:49:53.382 --> 00:49:53.682]  Okay.
[00:49:55.143 --> 00:50:02.026]  The same thing supposedly happens with CNN and I got a couple emails from the CNN crew that supposedly were supposed to come out and see him.
[00:50:02.646 --> 00:50:07.709]  However, what happens is that they come out and they get all the information but never run it.
[00:50:07.769 --> 00:50:19.314]  And I say to them, and I bluntly, as a journalist and as a person who basically looks at things from a journalistic point of view if I was an editor or whatever,
[00:50:20.023 --> 00:50:24.407]  I'm not going out on a journalistic limb, perhaps if Rodriguez is the only one that hears that.
[00:50:24.427 --> 00:50:25.488]  I want some verification.
[00:50:25.508 --> 00:50:27.629]  Well, he's got a collaboration of 14 people.
[00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:28.010]  Names.
[00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:29.231]  Exactly.
[00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:35.376]  We're going to be talking with him, and I want to hold you over when Mr. Rodriguez is on with us, but I also want to add this right now.
[00:50:35.576 --> 00:50:37.617]  It wasn't a journalistic limb, Alex, is what I'm saying.
[00:50:38.198 --> 00:50:39.039]  I understand it wasn't.
[00:50:39.059 --> 00:50:40.840]  We have all these other witnesses, but let me just add this.
[00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:44.283]  Before we get a break, this is very important.
[00:50:45.794 --> 00:50:50.360]  Don't forget about the three data recorders and the firemen and the rescue workers.
[00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:52.003]  Oh, of course.
[00:50:52.043 --> 00:50:53.905]  And that was in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:50:54.526 --> 00:50:58.772]  But again, it's still a news blackout other than the Philadelphia Daily News, this show, and your columns.
[00:50:59.032 --> 00:50:59.613]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.484]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.744 --> 00:51:07.326]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.666 --> 00:51:12.332]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.672 --> 00:51:17.097]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.538 --> 00:51:21.703]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.923 --> 00:51:24.765]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.865 --> 00:51:29.529]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.729 --> 00:51:34.172]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.372 --> 00:51:41.598]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:05.047 --> 00:53:10.108]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:53:10.328 --> 00:53:16.510]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:22.411]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:53:22.691 --> 00:53:28.192]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:53:28.432 --> 00:53:32.273]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:53:32.293 --> 00:53:38.574]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:53:39.074 --> 00:53:39.694]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:53:39.734 --> 00:53:44.435]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[00:53:44.575 --> 00:53:48.736]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:53:48.976 --> 00:53:51.898]  Well, with a Garricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:56.983]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com and order today.
[00:53:57.203 --> 00:53:58.003]  A Garricus Bio.
[00:53:58.043 --> 00:53:59.625]  Because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:54:07.131 --> 00:54:11.014]  Look, I know we got a load of phone lines.
[00:54:11.054 --> 00:54:14.737]  I haven't given the phone number up yet today, because we're not taking calls yet.
[00:54:15.137 --> 00:54:15.658]  We will do that.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.502]  Sometime in the next hour, we've got to cover this information.
[00:54:23.543 --> 00:54:24.323]  It's so important.
[00:54:25.184 --> 00:54:34.789]  We're talking to, of course, the writer for American Free Press and a lot of other publications, Greg Zemanski, about all the major news that's coming out about 9-11.
[00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.851]  More and more whistleblowers going public.
[00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:40.573]  More and more insiders going public.
[00:54:40.613 --> 00:54:44.235]  More and more people who witnessed what happened on 9-11 going public.
[00:54:44.295 --> 00:54:45.056]  Rescue workers.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.683]  Greg, have you seen the David Shaler MI5 article we just put out today?
[00:54:49.963 --> 00:54:50.544]  You know something?
[00:54:50.764 --> 00:54:52.665]  I'll be honest with you, I glanced at it.
[00:54:53.406 --> 00:54:55.087]  And I did not get a good read yet.
[00:54:56.398 --> 00:55:00.662]  I mean, here's a guy who was with MI5 talking about the British being involved in terrorism over there.
[00:55:01.082 --> 00:55:08.949]  He's looking as a counter-terrorism specialist who worked on terrorism in that area of the MI5 at 9-11.
[00:55:08.989 --> 00:55:11.211]  He's saying it's obviously an inside job as well.
[00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:14.554]  That's an explosive story, Alex, and I'll make sure I get and read it.
[00:55:14.634 --> 00:55:15.955]  It sounds very interesting.
[00:55:16.753 --> 00:55:17.933]  Well, I hope you do some work with it.
[00:55:17.993 --> 00:55:19.714]  Yeah, I'm going to take a look at it.
[00:55:19.814 --> 00:55:24.295]  I know I stopped and I didn't have time this morning to get at it.
[00:55:24.315 --> 00:55:32.318]  Well, getting back to Mr. Rodriguez, he's got 14 witnesses and you've got the explosion and the fire shooting up.
[00:55:32.918 --> 00:55:39.060]  Well, if I could just say something kind of in general on a story like this and why I believe it's important.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:56.136]  As you know, if you just isolate the incident of how the, let's say the North Tower went down, you're hearing all these stories about the scientific explanations from the government's point of view, the scientific explanations from the conspiracy theorists' point of view.
[00:55:56.816 --> 00:56:02.820]  And if you imagine yourself in a court of law right now listening to that, you take the next step and you bring up a witness.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.962]  You bring up a witness like Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:56:05.042 --> 00:56:12.527]  Now as you know, eyewitness testimony can be very reliable, it can be very unreliable.
[00:56:13.207 --> 00:56:16.890]  And that's basically since, if you line up ten people and you look at a murder,
[00:56:17.435 --> 00:56:19.136]  You're going to get maybe ten different accounts.
[00:56:19.216 --> 00:56:20.317]  People see different things.
[00:56:20.357 --> 00:56:32.183]  However, when eyewitness testimony is the most valuable, and more credible than scientific explanations, is when it can be corroborated, and corroborated with documentation.
[00:56:32.563 --> 00:56:34.724]  And that's exactly what Rodriguez's story is.
[00:56:35.385 --> 00:56:43.849]  So basically, if you're a jury listening to, well, did it fall down by explosives, or did it fall down by the airplanes up there?
[00:56:45.010 --> 00:57:00.356]  Rodriguez's testimony, corroborated by 14 other people, is going to sway the jury to the side of the demolition, of course, because, basically, you look at what he saw, how 14 people see a burning man coming from, you know, within seconds, from below.
[00:57:01.477 --> 00:57:02.178]  How could it be?
[00:57:02.518 --> 00:57:03.939]  Understand, they're in the basement.
[00:57:04.039 --> 00:57:05.199]  They're in the basement complex.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:05.420]  What?
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.461]  Four floors beneath the ground?
[00:57:07.501 --> 00:57:08.942]  So I would guess they were in the first basement.
[00:57:08.982 --> 00:57:10.363]  Well, I think he said sub-level one.
[00:57:10.563 --> 00:57:12.864]  So that would be the first basement level.
[00:57:12.904 --> 00:57:14.225]  So there's several other basement levels?
[00:57:14.245 --> 00:57:14.706]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:14.846 --> 00:57:18.548]  And then somebody... Did this fellow come running from their level or from another level?
[00:57:18.648 --> 00:57:19.249]  His level.
[00:57:20.369 --> 00:57:22.110]  He was only 300 feet away from the office.
[00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:24.912]  And he reported that fire shot up out of it.
[00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:29.075]  Yeah, fire shot through that... through the elevator shaft.
[00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:32.131]  They could not have shut down that quickly.
[00:57:32.551 --> 00:57:35.453]  Well, they admitted fire didn't shoot down even to like the 50th floor.
[00:57:35.473 --> 00:57:36.114]  It was all going on up top.
[00:57:36.134 --> 00:57:39.877]  Yeah, I mean, there were people using those elevators up until... I mean, they couldn't have shut down that quickly.
[00:57:39.897 --> 00:57:41.178]  Yeah, they were using the elevators.
[00:57:41.218 --> 00:57:41.898]  So, wow.
[00:57:42.219 --> 00:57:43.219]  Within the time span.
[00:57:43.239 --> 00:57:44.821]  And which particular tower was he in?
[00:57:45.341 --> 00:57:45.561]  North.
[00:57:46.082 --> 00:57:46.262]  Yeah.
[00:57:47.262 --> 00:57:48.163]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:48.383 --> 00:57:53.347]  And now we have CNN and NBC going and interviewing him, but not reporting on him.
[00:57:53.367 --> 00:57:54.288]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:55.489]  I mean, look at...
[00:57:56.399 --> 00:58:05.191]  The journalist that, you know, I want to know, I'd like to hear that conversation when they decided not to run this or decided not to use their resources to find these other people and verify that.
[00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:07.655]  I mean, here's a guy burnt to crisp in a hospital.
[00:58:08.781 --> 00:58:13.886]  I'm not saying, even to a point where if they would have just investigated this in a forthright manner
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.844]  Uh, however, do you think that investigation might have been contrary to the government's story?
[00:58:34.884 --> 00:58:36.085]  Maybe that's why they didn't do it.
[00:58:36.105 --> 00:58:38.466]  Alright, we're getting Mr. Rodriguez on the line right now.
[00:58:38.527 --> 00:58:39.227]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.709 --> 00:58:46.393]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.413 --> 00:58:46.713]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.273 --> 00:59:00.334]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.034 --> 00:59:02.154]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.795 --> 00:59:03.635]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:05.316]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.936 --> 00:59:09.858]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.118 --> 00:59:14.239]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.259 --> 00:59:15.820]  Last thing out.
[00:59:26.141 --> 00:59:30.765]  Southern California to upstate New York from Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:59:31.646 --> 00:59:35.209]  Pensacola, Florida to Chicago, Illinois.
[00:59:35.229 --> 00:59:37.391]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:39.032]  We're going to be here for another two hours.
[00:59:39.052 --> 00:59:40.293]  We're into hour number two.
[00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:42.595]  Coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:59:44.051 --> 00:59:51.515]  We have the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts, who doubts the official 9-11 story going public.
[00:59:51.935 --> 00:59:56.138]  We, of course, have broken the news that former MI5 agents as 9-11 an inside job.
[00:59:56.598 --> 00:59:57.699]  Attack was coup d'etat.
[00:59:57.719 --> 00:59:59.660]  Buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.041]  David Shaler, who worked terrorism,
[01:00:03.565 --> 01:00:18.330]  And award-winning researcher and author, Greg Zemanski, is also riding shotgun with us, breaking and magnifying so many of these articles, including 9-11 rescue workers finding three of the four data recorders and being told to shut up!
[01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:24.552]  And that's even made it, subsequently, into things like the Philadelphia Daily News.
[01:00:24.632 --> 01:00:26.213]  So this is confirmed.
[01:00:26.653 --> 01:00:28.554]  There are lawsuits involving all of this.
[01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:31.655]  I'm extremely honored to
[01:00:33.584 --> 01:00:37.467]  We have on the line one of the survivors who was in the North Tower, William Rodriguez.
[01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:47.994]  We talked about his story in the last 30 minutes, how they witnessed explosions down in their basement level and it burning and hurting people, the fire coming up, not down.
[01:00:49.134 --> 01:00:52.076]  And he helped a lot of folks of course get out of there, barely survived himself.
[01:00:52.597 --> 01:00:56.639]  And we're honored to have William Rodriguez on with us.
[01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:57.380]  William, welcome.
[01:00:58.394 --> 01:00:59.194]  My pleasure.
[01:00:59.274 --> 01:01:00.415]  Thank you for inviting me.
[01:01:00.475 --> 01:01:01.795]  It's an honor for me to be here.
[01:01:01.935 --> 01:01:06.397]  Well, it's great to be here, and we've got Greg Riding Shotgun with us, so we'll be popping in and out with him.
[01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:14.360]  We're about to break here in a moment, but I want to... I want to first just talk about who you are, why you were working there, and then when we get back, I want to tell the story.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:20.663]  I want to go back to those first minutes and give you the floor and just let you tell us exactly, in your words, what happened.
[01:01:20.683 --> 01:01:24.064]  But first off, tell us about yourself, Mr. Rodriguez, and why you're going public.
[01:01:24.853 --> 01:01:26.493]  Yes, my name is William Rodriguez.
[01:01:26.613 --> 01:01:29.794]  I worked in the building for almost 20 years.
[01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:40.877]  On September 11, I would have been 20 years, and actually I was there as the person in charge of all the stairwells of the North Tower.
[01:01:41.257 --> 01:01:46.118]  I was the porter that had to do the maintenance of the whole building, of all the stairwells.
[01:01:46.158 --> 01:01:50.339]  The building had three staircases, A, B, and C, and I was the person in charge of it.
[01:01:51.989 --> 01:01:54.070]  And you've been there 20 years as of September 11, 2001.
[01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.791]  That is correct.
[01:01:57.071 --> 01:02:03.553]  And like I said, I have a personal view of exactly what happened on September 11.
[01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:09.475]  Not only was I there, but I'm actually the last survivor from the North Tower that was pulled from the rubble.
[01:02:09.975 --> 01:02:11.436]  And I actually survived under the rubble.
[01:02:11.576 --> 01:02:12.696]  Now I remember that.
[01:02:14.677 --> 01:02:17.918]  When did you start understanding the official story was a fraud?
[01:02:17.938 --> 01:02:18.358]  Day one?
[01:02:19.805 --> 01:02:40.581]  Well, I didn't know on day one, I'll be honest with you, because Alex, at the beginning, I came out on the news, probably days or weeks, because I came out with the story and I testified for the media, for national media, on that same day of what I experienced, and then I started to realize that my story was continuously being edited.
[01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:46.605]  That the whole information that I was given, that I was given, wasn't coming out correctly.
[01:02:46.665 --> 01:02:47.766]  That's absolutely key!
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.941]  Yeah, that was actually tidbits here and there.
[01:02:50.961 --> 01:02:54.864]  So regardless of who you talked to, they were editing key parts up?
[01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:56.365]  That is correct.
[01:02:56.565 --> 01:03:00.788]  That is correct, and it was a continuous effort from all the medias.
[01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:06.552]  I actually interviewed hundreds and hundreds of hours from September 11 until today.
[01:03:06.612 --> 01:03:15.277]  I mean, I have a whole library of interviews, and it's incredible because I have some raw copies of some of the interviews that I actually performed.
[01:03:15.437 --> 01:03:16.078]  Unbelievable!
[01:03:16.858 --> 01:03:21.159]  And it's unbelievable because what came out on the air was totally different of what I actually said.
[01:03:21.419 --> 01:03:26.981]  Oh, I would love for you to send me some of those videos so I can put a web TV piece together to show people.
[01:03:27.021 --> 01:03:27.781]  I would be honored.
[01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:29.221]  Wow, this is incredible.
[01:03:29.261 --> 01:03:29.941]  Sir, we're going to break.
[01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:31.142]  Long segment coming up.
[01:03:31.582 --> 01:03:32.742]  Plenty of time to get into this.
[01:03:32.902 --> 01:03:35.023]  I want to tell your story.
[01:03:35.623 --> 01:03:44.305]  What happened from the eyewitness, the 14 corroborating witnesses you have on September 11th in the basement, level one of the basement.
[01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:47.113]  On September 11th, that morning.
[01:03:47.633 --> 01:03:48.874]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:03:48.894 --> 01:03:49.574]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:56.095]  What really happened September 11th?
[01:03:56.255 --> 01:03:57.375]  And who stands to gain?
[01:03:58.055 --> 01:03:59.336]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:19.200]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:24.101]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:26.942]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:30.442]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:04:30.482 --> 01:04:32.323]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:06:17.162 --> 01:06:17.422]  I think.
[01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:38.101]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.461]  We're talking to an individual who's quite famous.
[01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:09.602]  He was the last person living to be pulled from the wreckage.
[01:07:10.742 --> 01:07:16.123]  WTC basement blast and injured burn victim blows official 9-11 story sky-high.
[01:07:16.983 --> 01:07:18.024]  He's William Rodriguez.
[01:07:18.564 --> 01:07:24.845]  And the key here is, is I remember getting the inklings of his story, and many others who saw the same thing, on 9-11.
[01:07:24.885 --> 01:07:30.907]  But every time he talked to a major TV network or station, they would put him on the news but edit out.
[01:07:32.213 --> 01:07:35.960]  How he talked about the explosions down in the base of the building.
[01:07:36.381 --> 01:07:39.526]  Which firefighters and others said they also heard, witnessed, and saw.
[01:07:39.566 --> 01:07:41.109]  Even reported for saying it as it happened.
[01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:42.972]  On a few of the news channels.
[01:07:43.032 --> 01:07:45.056]  So, they didn't want that out there.
[01:07:45.916 --> 01:07:56.700]  And remember, they ordered the FAA tape shredded, they ordered the people on the ground that found three of the flight data recorders, you know, highly decorated rescue workers, keep your mouth shut, you know, when they found these recorders, clearly marked.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.163]  Just the continual hauling away the rubble under national security to China, despite the fact the family tried to stop it.
[01:08:04.263 --> 01:08:09.245]  He was the head of maintenance for the three major stairwells for the entire building.
[01:08:09.725 --> 01:08:14.427]  Been there 20 years, a senior member of maintenance.
[01:08:15.413 --> 01:08:17.535]  And, uh, you know, keeping all of that in place.
[01:08:17.835 --> 01:08:20.818]  And, uh, so joining us again is William Rodriguez.
[01:08:21.538 --> 01:08:24.941]  Uh, and just recapping what he said in the last segment for Stations That Don't Carry, that first segment.
[01:08:25.562 --> 01:08:27.864]  Uh, William, now, let's just go through the story.
[01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:31.247]  That morning, what you were doing, what happened, please describe it for us.
[01:08:32.418 --> 01:08:35.680]  I usually get to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.682]  That day, as a miracle, I went in late at 8.30.
[01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.143]  I called the office and I said I was going to be a little late.
[01:08:42.464 --> 01:08:47.626]  And they said, well, you have to get here because we don't have anybody to take your position doing the stairwells.
[01:08:48.027 --> 01:08:49.307]  So I got there at 8.30.
[01:08:49.507 --> 01:08:53.970]  I say it's a miracle because I would have been at the top of the building when the pain hit.
[01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:58.432]  The reason is because I started cleaning the stairwells from the top down.
[01:08:58.792 --> 01:09:01.674]  And actually, I will have breakfast every morning at Windows of the World.
[01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:27.232]  Employees at the top of the building so at that moment 830 I was actually at the basement talking to one of the supervisors and around 845 we hear an explosion a huge explosion and it came out from under our feet and I'm telling you this because of experience I've been there for 20 years so I do understand where it was the noise coming from and I
[01:09:28.067 --> 01:09:32.590]  That moment that it was an electrical generator that just blew up on their sub-levels.
[01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:35.673]  And when I say sub-levels, it's because I was located on B1.
[01:09:35.953 --> 01:09:36.994]  That's basement number one.
[01:09:37.114 --> 01:09:40.156]  And the building has six sub-levels, all the way down to B6.
[01:09:40.657 --> 01:09:45.100]  So I felt this huge explosion, and at that moment I was going to verbalize it.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.743]  I was going to say, uh, it's one of the electrical generators that just blew up.
[01:09:49.283 --> 01:09:53.766]  And when I was going to verbalize it, it's when I heard the impact at the top of the building.
[01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:57.149]  And it sounded very, uh, pretty far away.
[01:09:57.969 --> 01:10:02.684]  And it was so hard that the walls shaked and broke.
[01:10:02.724 --> 01:10:04.128]  They cracked all over.
[01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:08.674]  And the false ceiling just collapsed and the speaker system got activated.
[01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.715]  And everybody started screaming.
[01:10:10.735 --> 01:10:12.377]  There was like 14 people inside the office.
[01:10:13.077 --> 01:10:15.539]  And at that moment, we don't know what's happening.
[01:10:15.599 --> 01:10:18.281]  We thought, again, it's an explosion at the sub-level.
[01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:27.768]  And when I was going to pick up the phone to call the emergency, there's a guy coming running into the office saying, explosion, explosion, explosion.
[01:10:28.428 --> 01:10:30.049]  And this guy was a black guy.
[01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:32.291]  He has his hands extended.
[01:10:33.058 --> 01:10:40.704]  And all the skin from under his armpit was pulled on both arms all the way to the fingertips and it was hanging like a piece of cloth.
[01:10:41.344 --> 01:10:45.587]  And actually I thought it was clothing what he has hanging and then I realized it was his skin.
[01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:51.351]  He was standing in front of a freight elevator at the basement when he was actually burned.
[01:10:51.951 --> 01:10:54.373]  Now this is the basement, this is not the top of the building.
[01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:56.475]  And he said, what happened?
[01:10:56.495 --> 01:10:58.136]  And he said, the elevators, the elevators.
[01:10:59.017 --> 01:11:03.244]  And I went to pick up the phone to call the EMS that was located on Building 2.
[01:11:04.265 --> 01:11:06.429]  Building 1 and Building 2 connected through the basement.
[01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:09.855]  And when I say Building 2, it's the South Tower.
[01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:15.320]  So I went to pick up the phone and at that moment we heard another explosion.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.682]  And the floor shake so much it was like an earthquake.
[01:11:19.223 --> 01:11:22.526]  And at that moment I was thinking that it was probably an earthquake.
[01:11:23.026 --> 01:11:26.809]  I was telling everybody to get on the door frames because the floor was moving.
[01:11:27.129 --> 01:11:28.751]  And then I realized, well what am I talking about?
[01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:30.412]  This is an explosion what I'm hearing.
[01:11:30.872 --> 01:11:31.493]  Everybody out!
[01:11:31.533 --> 01:11:32.093]  Everybody out!
[01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:33.695]  I started pushing everybody out of the office.
[01:11:33.775 --> 01:11:36.036]  I take the guy, the black guy that was burned.
[01:11:36.176 --> 01:11:38.238]  The name of the guy is Felipe David.
[01:11:38.578 --> 01:11:41.100]  He's a guy from Honduras, which I did not know.
[01:11:41.561 --> 01:11:46.325]  He worked for Aramac, the company that does supplies for all the vending machines.
[01:11:47.045 --> 01:11:52.309]  And, uh, I put his arm around my shoulder and I started helping him out out of the building.
[01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:55.712]  Now, the way to get out was through the loading dock.
[01:11:56.152 --> 01:11:58.134]  And, uh, it was pretty far.
[01:11:58.174 --> 01:11:59.135]  I mean, we're talking about
[01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:04.710]  Uh, well, uh, like 600 or 800 feet away.
[01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:09.294]  And, uh, once I get out with all these people, I see an ambulance.
[01:12:09.334 --> 01:12:10.155]  I stop the ambulance.
[01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:12.337]  I put Mr. Felipe David inside the ambulance.
[01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:16.183]  And that's when I hear, a plane hit the building, a plane hit the building.
[01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:26.588]  I turned around, I look up, I see the hole, I see the fire, I see the debris falling apart, and all of a sudden I go into a frenzy because I started thinking about the people from Windows of the World.
[01:12:26.949 --> 01:12:29.210]  I said, we gotta go back, we gotta go back, we gotta go back.
[01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:35.613]  And the same people that I just pulled from the basement, they started screaming at me, Rodriguez, you're not going back in there, you stay here.
[01:12:35.913 --> 01:12:38.895]  Even my supervisor that I just pulled out.
[01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:40.756]  But I said, no, no, we gotta go back.
[01:12:41.397 --> 01:12:45.062]  And I took the radio from the security guard and I started running inside the building again.
[01:12:45.623 --> 01:12:55.255]  When I get inside, there was water all over because the sprinkler system got activated and I get to the top of the loading dock and by
[01:12:55.942 --> 01:12:59.625]  Let me just stop you for a second Mr. Rodriguez before you go to the operational center
[01:13:27.239 --> 01:13:38.766]  Being there in the first bombing, knowing what it feels like, and then experiencing the individual running in and saying the fire came up, I want to get into some detail about what Mr. David said to you on that.
[01:13:39.386 --> 01:13:50.173]  And then I also want to ask you the question, were you looking for truck bombs because you were putting two and two together in the back of your brain from hearing and feeling that explosion?
[01:13:51.175 --> 01:13:52.436]  And because of the experience of 1993.
[01:13:52.516 --> 01:14:02.624]  Now remember, being there, the actual expectation of something happening in the building wasn't constant.
[01:14:03.225 --> 01:14:12.071]  The employees, we always talk about it on a weekly basis because we said, this is a job that was never finished.
[01:14:12.272 --> 01:14:13.332]  They're going to try it again.
[01:14:13.893 --> 01:14:20.338]  So we continued having these kind of conversations on a weekly basis so we were aware
[01:14:21.418 --> 01:14:24.279]  By osmosis of everything that was happening around.
[01:14:25.039 --> 01:14:37.244]  And I will bring you to that point, that experience later on, because when I testified to the 9-11 Commission, I did give them some details that miraculously didn't show up on the final report.
[01:14:37.604 --> 01:14:43.506]  Yeah, let's talk about that, but I interrupted you at the point you got to the Emergency Operations Center.
[01:14:44.153 --> 01:14:49.316]  Yeah, the Operation Control Center was actually a center that was created after 1993, Bombi.
[01:14:49.696 --> 01:14:57.521]  The World Trade Center, they spent $136 million to upgrade the whole security in the building.
[01:14:57.942 --> 01:15:01.444]  A quarter of a billion, actually, but $136 was just for security.
[01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:08.188]  They created this center, and stupidly enough, they put it inside the building, which made sense to have it outside the building.
[01:15:08.912 --> 01:15:09.533]  I think so.
[01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:29.516]  That the building got hit.
[01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:33.237]  He was on the sub-levels of the South Tower.
[01:15:33.577 --> 01:15:39.879]  And that gives you a general idea of how many people probably died on the South Tower without ever knowing what was happening.
[01:15:40.639 --> 01:15:42.340]  And he said, you gotta get out, you gotta get out.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.180]  A plane hit the building.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:43.880]  He couldn't believe it.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:51.982]  And there was a lady from the Marriott Hotel Security, the one that checks every employee, she's there trembling.
[01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.355]  Because she was a new employee.
[01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:56.656]  She didn't know what was happening.
[01:15:57.096 --> 01:15:58.276]  I said, you got to get out of here.
[01:15:58.316 --> 01:16:01.678]  And she was afraid of leaving her post because she didn't want to get fired.
[01:16:01.698 --> 01:16:03.359]  He said, no, you got to get out.
[01:16:03.379 --> 01:16:10.502]  What about the reports that up high in the towers there was some type of speaker system telling people to stay at their post?
[01:16:11.362 --> 01:16:12.562]  That was Lloyd Thompson.
[01:16:12.583 --> 01:16:15.744]  It was a guy that disappeared for three years.
[01:16:16.483 --> 01:16:25.508]  And he testified on the last week of the hearings for the 9-11 Commission, and they said that they couldn't find him.
[01:16:25.588 --> 01:16:32.912]  And it's the funniest thing, because I have Lloyd on my organization from day one, and I could have supplied him very easily.
[01:16:32.932 --> 01:16:35.493]  It's something that, you know, is mind-boggling.
[01:16:35.613 --> 01:16:39.135]  Okay, well then tell us, who was on the speaker's sink state or post?
[01:16:40.422 --> 01:16:42.263]  Actually, it wasn't that it stayed in the post.
[01:16:42.923 --> 01:16:56.431]  It was actually saying that, you know, people were coming down on the plaza level, on the mezzanine level, and that was actually the area that was hit by the first plane, and all the debris was falling down that part.
[01:16:56.691 --> 01:17:05.236]  So, actually, it was a call for people to go back, not to get out on the plaza level, because they were going to get hit by the debris.
[01:17:05.556 --> 01:17:08.517]  So, it was an actual misunderstanding that happened on that moment.
[01:17:09.932 --> 01:17:14.355]  The amount of automatic recordings that they have in the building.
[01:17:14.636 --> 01:17:16.497]  Now, not every floor worked.
[01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:19.399]  Not every floor has the speaker system activated.
[01:17:19.439 --> 01:17:23.883]  Well, that's a major mystery then, at least partially solved.
[01:17:23.923 --> 01:17:24.283]  Amazing.
[01:17:24.563 --> 01:17:26.485]  Let's bring in Greg Zemensky.
[01:17:27.165 --> 01:17:29.327]  Greg, there's so many points here.
[01:17:29.927 --> 01:17:32.789]  Should we get more into his eyewitness account?
[01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:36.932]  Or should we get into how the media tried to cover up and edit
[01:17:37.973 --> 01:17:41.660]  Every time they interviewed Mr. Rodriguez, one of the heroes of 9-11, huh, Greg?
[01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:48.574]  Well, I think, you know, you'll have to stick with his eyewitness account and those 14 people and maybe what happened to them.
[01:17:49.449 --> 01:17:58.294]  And then it very well flows into the fact that the media had all this stuff and why didn't they at least tell their story?
[01:17:58.334 --> 01:18:00.675]  They're not going out on a journalistic limb here.
[01:18:00.895 --> 01:18:01.375]  Exactly.
[01:18:01.395 --> 01:18:05.517]  Were you guys, I mean I've talked to a lot of firefighters, other people who were told to shut up.
[01:18:05.557 --> 01:18:08.759]  Were you told ever directly or do you know people who were told to shut up?
[01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:13.522]  Well, indirectly, they told me not to touch several subjects.
[01:18:13.543 --> 01:18:15.965]  They would say, just stick to this, what we're talking about.
[01:18:15.985 --> 01:18:17.066]  Don't talk about other things.
[01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:18.827]  And it didn't make any sense.
[01:18:18.947 --> 01:18:23.752]  I always maintain my story from the day that I was pulled from the rubble.
[01:18:24.072 --> 01:18:27.955]  Listen, I showed up on CNN on that day, okay?
[01:18:28.496 --> 01:18:32.660]  And if you can get the transcript, because I have been unsuccessful, but I luckily... No, I remember.
[01:18:33.869 --> 01:18:35.592]  But luckily I have a copy.
[01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:40.498]  And my story now is exactly the same one that I gave on that day.
[01:18:40.598 --> 01:18:41.759]  Oh, I gotta have that tape.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.881]  I gotta get that tape.
[01:18:43.101 --> 01:18:44.243]  Stay there, Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:18:44.623 --> 01:18:47.266]  We'll be right back with yourself and of course Greg.
[01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:50.611]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:18:54.276 --> 01:19:00.639]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:19:00.859 --> 01:19:05.881]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:14.105]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:19:14.245 --> 01:19:21.288]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:22.729]  There are no side effects.
[01:19:22.889 --> 01:19:26.270]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:27.450]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:19:27.731 --> 01:19:29.011]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:36.054]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:19:36.154 --> 01:19:38.595]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:41.719]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.

[01:19:41.799 --> 01:19:42.760]  One more time that's 866-885-6625.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:20:03.562]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:20:03.803 --> 01:20:15.046]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:20:15.386 --> 01:20:20.207]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:20:20.427 --> 01:20:21.107]  are no problem.
[01:20:21.347 --> 01:20:27.989]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:28.209 --> 01:20:35.031]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:37.072]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.373]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:20:39.593 --> 01:20:41.313]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.

[01:20:54.682 --> 01:20:57.005]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.025 --> 01:20:58.366]  The real money folks.
[01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.552]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:21:04.073 --> 01:21:04.773]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:21:07.572 --> 01:21:09.433]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:21:09.973 --> 01:21:12.335]  A 5% increase.
[01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:18.798]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:21:18.918 --> 01:21:22.120]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.061]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[01:21:24.081 --> 01:21:24.741]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:21:29.122 --> 01:21:32.164]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:21:32.725 --> 01:21:37.869]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:21:58.088 --> 01:21:58.989]  No more imagining!
[01:21:59.169 --> 01:22:03.133]  It's time to experience the relaxing and rejuvenating Total Health Spa by HTE.
[01:22:03.213 --> 01:22:09.439]  The Total Health Spa consists of two medical devices working together to promote increased circulation and oxygenation.
[01:22:09.539 --> 01:22:13.503]  Helps to support proper body function through detoxification, cell regeneration,
[01:22:13.643 --> 01:22:14.063]  We're good to go!
[01:22:37.006 --> 01:22:39.369]  It makes you feel absolutely terrific!

[01:23:04.765 --> 01:23:07.367]  All right, approaching the halfway point in this broadcast.
[01:23:07.427 --> 01:23:11.650]  We're going to keep Mr. Rodriguez on with us.
[01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:13.151]  He's honored us by doing that.
[01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:13.911]  One of the heroes of 9-11.
[01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:16.333]  Helped save a lot of people and barely made it out himself.
[01:23:16.693 --> 01:23:18.054]  Last person to be pulled from the rubble.
[01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:26.720]  We're going to keep him on with us with Paul Craig Roberts, the former Assistant Secretary of Treasury under Ronald Reagan and his administration.
[01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:32.815]  And if Mr. Greg Zemanski wants to stay with us, he's welcome to ride shotgun.
[01:23:32.855 --> 01:23:36.579]  We'll kind of have our own little roundtable discussion here.
[01:23:36.599 --> 01:23:44.186]  I was just talking to you, Mr. William Rodriguez, during the break, and you talked about how
[01:23:45.996 --> 01:23:58.219]  You were telling me how you've just been on this European tour, I guess with Jimmy Walters, exposing all of this, and almost, you didn't say almost, you said everyone knew the truth, everyone you talked to in Europe never believed the story.
[01:23:58.459 --> 01:23:59.820]  Tell us about that, that's exciting.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.840]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:06.962]  Jimmy Walters put this nice mega tour through the whole Europe.
[01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:14.964]  We went to Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Madrid, every single country that we went to.
[01:24:15.922 --> 01:24:21.628]  Don't want we have a dissenting voice that the official story was a lie.
[01:24:21.908 --> 01:24:27.815]  They even have questions that, listen, we have unfiltered news here compared to the news that you were getting over there.
[01:24:28.433 --> 01:24:35.298]  Here we continue having interviews from the European media that was never shown on the American media.
[01:24:35.878 --> 01:24:37.039]  And why did that happen?
[01:24:37.099 --> 01:24:41.442]  I said, well, you know, at that moment is when we explained that it was a whole cover-up.
[01:24:41.882 --> 01:24:52.129]  Well, yeah, that shows control that day one they would put you on CNN as a hero and as a survivor, went back into the building, had it collapse on you, the last to be dug out alive.
[01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:54.230]  I mean, think of what a big story that is.
[01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:59.373]  I remember you were all over TV, and they would edit out craftily any discussion of explosions.
[01:24:59.453 --> 01:25:04.275]  Greg, that really shows the premeditated nature, doesn't it, Greg?
[01:25:04.575 --> 01:25:07.037]  Well, yeah, I thought it showed the state of the media right now.
[01:25:07.057 --> 01:25:16.962]  You know, like it said, this is all our story, and William's story should be told, and the media has an obligation in a major story like that to get it right.
[01:25:17.555 --> 01:25:22.578]  And you can see from what William's saying, they basically had another agenda.
[01:25:23.038 --> 01:25:28.121]  And it's that agenda, along with the government agenda, that needs to be exposed.
[01:25:28.801 --> 01:25:31.483]  And that's basically what we're doing right now.
[01:25:31.503 --> 01:25:35.065]  Well I want to go back specifically, I mean understand we have an eyewitness here.
[01:25:35.085 --> 01:25:37.066]  We have these other 14 eyewitnesses.
[01:25:37.846 --> 01:25:43.310]  We have the individual, Mr. David, burned, saying fire shot up.
[01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:46.291]  Clearly, firefighters reported bombs going off.
[01:25:46.611 --> 01:25:48.593]  We have Silverstein saying they pulled Building 7.
[01:25:49.373 --> 01:25:50.874]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:25:51.754 --> 01:25:56.757]  What were the other 14 people told to do, or where are they today, Mr. Rodriguez?
[01:25:57.498 --> 01:25:59.899]  Some of the people, we are unable to reach them.
[01:25:59.999 --> 01:26:04.422]  We have tried with Gretchen Mayensky to contact them, and we're having a difficult time.
[01:26:05.287 --> 01:26:05.767]  I think so.
[01:26:26.192 --> 01:26:26.752]  Thank you.
[01:26:47.023 --> 01:26:58.631]  Mr. Greg Simansky, couple of the emails of major networks that I received during that time and during the 9-11 Commission testimony for request of interviews and never came out.
[01:26:58.952 --> 01:27:00.793]  I did the interviews and it never came out.
[01:27:02.581 --> 01:27:03.342]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:03.422 --> 01:27:06.265]  This is just... Greg, have we gotten statements yet?
[01:27:06.285 --> 01:27:08.668]  I know you've been talking to them from CNN and others.
[01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:15.975]  You know, I'm in the process of giving CNN a call, but it's like getting through at the Pentagon nowadays.
[01:27:16.576 --> 01:27:21.701]  It used to be that you could call a journalist and they'd talk to you over the phone, but now it's very difficult.
[01:27:21.721 --> 01:27:23.023]  But I'm going to get to the bottom of what
[01:27:23.343 --> 01:27:25.025]  Why CNN didn't run the story?
[01:27:25.085 --> 01:27:30.330]  Because you see when Gore Vidal was on CNN about three years ago and he goes, I just won't stop the press before I go live.
[01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:31.331]  This is on TV.
[01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:38.938]  He goes, before I say anything, this is the first time there hasn't been a Lieutenant General in a suit behind the cameras telling me what I can and can't say.
[01:27:39.378 --> 01:27:47.826]  Yeah, I mean, this, you know, Mr. Rodriguez's story is vitally important for every American to hear, unedited.
[01:27:48.526 --> 01:27:50.870]  That's the reason why I wanted to tell it.
[01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:52.091]  It isn't my story.
[01:27:52.131 --> 01:27:53.713]  It isn't any other journalist's story.
[01:27:53.733 --> 01:27:58.500]  And sometimes journalists get off on this track that they own some story because they broke it first.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:59.621]  No, it's not that.
[01:28:00.002 --> 01:28:04.027]  It's Mr. Rodriguez's story and it's a story that the American people own.
[01:28:04.928 --> 01:28:10.971]  And on a day that occurred like that, to have it unedited, my goodness, what is going on?
[01:28:11.051 --> 01:28:28.821]  We need to get answers from NBC, not from the journalists, and I assume there's probably journalists who probably wanted to run it, but from the people who... Well, I tell ya, Greg, I've talked to a lot of major national reporters and they've told me point blank, we're told not to talk about this.
[01:28:31.215 --> 01:28:37.480]  We just lost Greg, and our other guest is on an internet phone, that's why it sounds a little bit broken, but it's just powerful info.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.144]  We're gonna stay with Mr. Rodriguez, and we've got Mr. Roberts coming on as well.
[01:28:44.025 --> 01:28:47.027]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:50.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.545 --> 01:28:57.346]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:28:57.446 --> 01:29:02.509]  We all eat sugars, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:29:02.749 --> 01:29:08.931]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:29:09.191 --> 01:29:14.854]  That's why a Garicus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:29:15.094 --> 01:29:20.598]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:29:20.858 --> 01:29:24.700]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.984]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:29:30.184 --> 01:29:30.324]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:29:30.344 --> 01:29:31.364]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[01:29:36.988 --> 01:29:41.170]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:44.292]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[01:29:44.492 --> 01:29:49.375]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.

[01:30:50.557 --> 01:30:52.418]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:55.539 --> 01:31:02.382]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:02.662 --> 01:31:05.023]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:05.263 --> 01:31:07.224]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:07.584 --> 01:31:12.926]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:13.306 --> 01:31:13.426]  Yes.
[01:31:13.446 --> 01:31:17.588]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:18.048 --> 01:31:20.550]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:25.932]  With its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:26.132 --> 01:31:33.196]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:33.716 --> 01:31:36.877]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at NukeAlert.com.

[01:32:11.453 --> 01:32:20.917]  Right now, on PrisonPlanet.com, former MI5 agent says 9-1-1 an inside job, attack was coup d'etat, buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[01:32:21.337 --> 01:32:25.118]  David Shaler worked in anti-terrorism, now going public.
[01:32:26.339 --> 01:32:28.300]  And at the same time, we have
[01:32:29.951 --> 01:32:39.198]  The Chief Economist at one of the major federal departments, Mr. Reynolds, going public a few weeks ago about how the official story is a complete fraud.
[01:32:39.218 --> 01:32:45.183]  We have Andres von Bulow, who was the Defense Secretary, Technology Minister, going public.
[01:32:45.743 --> 01:32:51.828]  We have Michael Nietzsche, number three in the Blair government, resigning two years ago and saying that they weren't involved in the attack.
[01:32:51.868 --> 01:32:53.409]  They certainly knew all about it and funded it.
[01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:57.352]  There's so many people, and online with us at the same time.
[01:32:57.392 --> 01:33:00.455]  I meant to only have them for 30 minutes, but it's such an important testimony.
[01:33:00.515 --> 01:33:07.421]  William Rodriguez, who was cited for pulling out so many people, trying to save them, going back in, having the building collapse on him and others.
[01:33:08.062 --> 01:33:12.766]  One of the last people to be saved, William Rodriguez, talking about those bombs, those explosions going off.
[01:33:12.786 --> 01:33:17.791]  We'll be popping back and forth with Mr. Rodriguez's story.
[01:33:19.524 --> 01:33:25.871]  Paul Craig Roberts, if the bio is too long to read at all, but he was distinguished fellow at the Cato Institute from 93 to 96.
[01:33:26.692 --> 01:33:35.480]  From 82 through 93 he held the William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 81 to 82.
[01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:38.864]  He served as Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Economic Policy
[01:33:39.524 --> 01:33:41.565]  For President Reagan and the Treasury Secretary.
[01:33:42.125 --> 01:33:57.132]  Reagan credited him with a major role in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 81 and he was awarded the Treasury Department's Meritorious Service Award for outstanding contributions to his formulation of the United States economic policy.
[01:33:58.104 --> 01:34:01.887]  And again, Dr. Roberts' bio is a couple more pages long.
[01:34:02.787 --> 01:34:07.511]  I read about 10% of it, but he's very distinguished, very conservative.
[01:34:07.531 --> 01:34:11.313]  I was reading some of his quotes the other day on air, and he said, look, I never change, they change.
[01:34:11.333 --> 01:34:13.174]  Just like Ron Paul has talked about.
[01:34:13.235 --> 01:34:16.557]  I mean, if you think a giant government is conservative, if you think
[01:34:17.037 --> 01:34:19.661]  You know, a 2.6 trillion dollar budget is conservative.
[01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:24.006]  If you think all this gun control and open borders is conservative, then call me a liberal.
[01:34:24.026 --> 01:34:25.408]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:34:25.768 --> 01:34:26.790]  Alex Jones is saying that.
[01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:30.294]  I would imagine Mr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts, would agree with us.
[01:34:30.474 --> 01:34:32.377]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for coming on sir.
[01:34:33.077 --> 01:34:33.398]  Thank you.
[01:34:34.572 --> 01:34:41.275]  I saw this headline with Greg Zeminski talking about how you're now questioning the official story.
[01:34:41.335 --> 01:34:47.098]  Not all the minutiae and the specifics, just how the whole thing stinks and all the lies we've been told.
[01:34:47.358 --> 01:34:49.759]  Can you tell us, sir, when you started questioning things?
[01:34:52.601 --> 01:34:54.662]  Well, I've been questioning things all my life, Alex.
[01:34:56.343 --> 01:35:00.365]  It's just the things that get questioned change with the events.
[01:35:02.782 --> 01:35:11.126]  I was questioning this invasion of Iraq before it happened.
[01:35:13.387 --> 01:35:24.432]  On 9-11, it's when I read Morgan Reynolds' account, which seemed to be very carefully researched, and I've known Morgan Reynolds for years.
[01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:27.433]  He's a distinguished professor.
[01:35:28.846 --> 01:35:33.247]  And he was Chief Economist in the Bush Administration for the Department of Commerce.
[01:35:33.367 --> 01:35:41.349]  He's also a member of the Mont Colerid Society, which is a group of libertarian conservative scholars.
[01:35:41.389 --> 01:35:48.011]  By the way, sir, he's now being called an evil liberal, and you've been called that when you guys have some of the most conservative records known.
[01:35:49.771 --> 01:35:53.092]  Yes, there are certainly a lot of
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:36:00.243]  Brownshirts out there who are true believers of whatever the government tells them.
[01:36:01.804 --> 01:36:19.133]  And anyhow, what made me wonder when I read Morgan Reynolds' account, because over the years, because I criticized or I tell the truth about the war, I get a lot of emails from people who say, well, what about 9-11?
[01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:19.613]  What about 9-11?
[01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:26.934]  Did not pay much attention to them because I don't know too much about that.
[01:36:26.974 --> 01:36:31.556]  But I have received a number of emails from people who claim they're engineers.
[01:36:32.877 --> 01:36:46.886]  And they say that the building could not have fallen the way it did according to the government account of what destroyed it.
[01:36:47.246 --> 01:36:49.767]  Well I personally have probably had 25 engineers on it.
[01:36:52.296 --> 01:36:52.997]  And what did they say?
[01:37:04.522 --> 01:37:08.943]  Well, that's another very curious thing, because no plane hit the 47-story building, and yet it collapsed as the others.
[01:37:31.847 --> 01:37:36.588]  And so the explanation of why it collapsed, I've never understood at all.
[01:37:38.489 --> 01:37:54.493]  I remember engineers were explaining to me that if the towers collapsed because of fire weakening the steel, that they would have fallen off at an angle and wrecked blocks of New York.
[01:37:54.594 --> 01:37:59.515]  They wouldn't have come down on themselves unless the fire was of equal intensity
[01:38:00.146 --> 01:38:01.968]  At every corner on every floor.
[01:38:03.469 --> 01:38:06.251]  And of course it wasn't.
[01:38:06.491 --> 01:38:08.433]  Well it was a cool black fire.
[01:38:08.453 --> 01:38:11.816]  Yeah, it was suffocating as far as the pictures show.
[01:38:11.876 --> 01:38:17.641]  People were standing in the gaping holes and the firefighters said that in one of the towers it was two small fires left.
[01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:18.281]  Yeah.
[01:38:18.542 --> 01:38:20.763]  And Alex, if I can interject.
[01:38:20.884 --> 01:38:22.405]  Yes, this is Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:38:23.126 --> 01:38:31.352]  Yeah, we have the presentation of the final draft of the NIST, the National Institute of Safety and Technology, here in New York, two days ago.
[01:38:32.012 --> 01:38:39.737]  And at the end of their presentation, we asked very hard questions because they said they didn't find any evidence of explosives inside the building.
[01:38:39.837 --> 01:38:40.958]  Yeah, that made the press.
[01:38:41.298 --> 01:38:42.839]  That made the press when you guys stood up.
[01:38:42.879 --> 01:38:43.440]  Tell us about it.
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.922]  Yeah, the funny thing is that I recorded my own
[01:38:48.635 --> 01:39:02.111]  With my own camera so we're going to make that available for you Alex so you can post it there so you can see exactly what happened there because again it was actually presented on the press but was never explained what happened with the people asking the questions.
[01:39:02.512 --> 01:39:06.637]  Now the problem was they couldn't answer when we asked about
[01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:11.301]  Well, why is the building fell in such an implosion way?
[01:39:11.762 --> 01:39:19.268]  And they said, well, there was no sustaining power by the other floor except that it was a free fall.
[01:39:19.588 --> 01:39:23.932]  And if that is true, why building 7 collapsed in the same way?
[01:39:24.232 --> 01:39:25.653]  And it was never hit by a plane.
[01:39:25.694 --> 01:39:30.758]  Well, let me... Mr. Rodriguez, let me bring this up to Dr. Roberts, because Dr. Roberts
[01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:51.732]  What are they going to do as the certain elements of the military-industrial complex that have the motive and all of this, what are they going to do in your educated expert opinion as more and more prominent people, and now it's beginning to snowball, begin to go public and just simply say the emperor is wearing no clothes?
[01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:53.893]  I mean, what do you forecast happening?
[01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:58.315]  I'm not sure anything will happen.
[01:39:58.795 --> 01:40:01.356]  If you think about it, we still don't know
[01:40:03.205 --> 01:40:06.407]  About the assassination of President John Kennedy.
[01:40:09.028 --> 01:40:15.152]  I mean, it's fairly clear that it wasn't the single lone nut gunman.
[01:40:15.613 --> 01:40:16.273]  But we don't know.
[01:40:16.313 --> 01:40:17.154]  We can't find out.
[01:40:17.194 --> 01:40:19.095]  It's been 40-something years, I think.
[01:40:20.055 --> 01:40:25.759]  We don't know about the assassination of Robert Kennedy, JFK's brother.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.501]  They lied to us about Ruby Red.
[01:40:28.581 --> 01:40:29.902]  They lied about Waco.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.443]  They lied about Saddam Hussein and the reason for going to war in Iraq.
[01:40:38.503 --> 01:40:45.586]  So I think we can just take for granted that the government lies about whatever.
[01:40:45.966 --> 01:40:48.007]  Yeah, they lie more often than telling the truth.
[01:40:48.027 --> 01:40:51.408]  There's no reason to believe what the government says.
[01:40:51.428 --> 01:40:57.371]  There's no record of integrity on controversial issues.
[01:40:58.584 --> 01:40:59.225]  With the government.
[01:40:59.325 --> 01:41:09.432]  And we do know that large numbers, I didn't used to think it was possible for them to hide something like the assassination of a president, what really happened.
[01:41:09.873 --> 01:41:13.956]  Because I didn't think you could get that many people to participate.
[01:41:13.996 --> 01:41:21.001]  But apparently it is possible to get people to be quiet and hush and go along.
[01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:26.205]  So I would imagine if Bush can survive the Downing Street memos,
[01:41:27.612 --> 01:41:41.477]  And in taking us into an illegal war that had no justification, that we were told was a cakewalk war that would be over in three weeks, and now Rumsfeld announced this morning that it'll be 12 years.
[01:41:43.618 --> 01:41:49.200]  If they can survive that, they can survive whatever happened to the Ford Traitor.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:55.602]  Now I have to say up front, I am not an expert and don't know what happened, but I do notice
[01:41:56.874 --> 01:42:01.715]  There are people who challenge the explanation and there's this great effort to shut them up.
[01:42:02.455 --> 01:42:08.737]  It seems to me if the government was confident of its story, it wouldn't take that tact.
[01:42:08.817 --> 01:42:12.258]  It would confront what is being said and answer it.
[01:42:12.598 --> 01:42:13.398]  We don't see that.
[01:42:13.458 --> 01:42:19.820]  They're not answering the people like the janitor who says he heard explosions in the basement.
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:23.381]  There's no real reason to think so many people are making
[01:42:25.092 --> 01:42:27.193]  Well, Dr. Roberts, you just stole my thunder.
[01:42:27.253 --> 01:42:27.713]  Exactly.
[01:42:27.753 --> 01:42:33.555]  We've got Mr. Rodriguez, who is an admitted hero, who went back in to try to save people and got buried.
[01:42:33.575 --> 01:42:35.235]  He was the last person to be saved.
[01:42:35.715 --> 01:42:40.797]  He was interviewed all over live TV and then would notice that they would edit out his comments about explosions.
[01:42:41.657 --> 01:42:42.457]  Well, it seems to.
[01:42:42.537 --> 01:42:45.458]  It's amazing to me that it's that easy for them to do.
[01:42:45.538 --> 01:42:47.219]  But what disturbs me is that there are people who challenge it.
[01:43:11.215 --> 01:43:11.995]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:43:25.773 --> 01:43:28.234]  Address what they say, give some answer.
[01:43:28.914 --> 01:43:39.698]  But sir, I mean on the face of it, the 9-11 Commission says there were no steel columns in the center of the buildings when they had some of the biggest steel columns, 44 of them, in the world.
[01:43:40.258 --> 01:43:45.320]  They don't even mention Building 7 in their 300 and something page report, or any of its indexes.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.801]  We don't know where they got their information, do we?
[01:43:48.861 --> 01:43:52.903]  I mean, these commissions often
[01:43:55.247 --> 01:43:57.451]  They get information that's fed to them.
[01:43:57.711 --> 01:44:00.896]  So the real question is, who's feeding them the information?
[01:44:01.297 --> 01:44:03.441]  Well, we've got Rice's deputy feeding them.
[01:44:03.721 --> 01:44:08.429]  Well then, that might tell you something.
[01:44:08.792 --> 01:44:11.334]  Well, sir, I mean, let's just get right down to brass tacks here.
[01:44:11.414 --> 01:44:13.555]  Obviously, you smell a gigantic stinking rat.
[01:44:13.935 --> 01:44:15.496]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[01:44:15.816 --> 01:44:17.217]  Something, you know, is dead in the attic.
[01:44:17.237 --> 01:44:18.438]  We gotta go clean it out of there.
[01:44:18.718 --> 01:44:21.200]  We know some big fat possum or raccoon is up there.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:30.205]  You know, do we have the will to open, which I've done, and, you know, open the trap door and go up in there and clean this maggot-infested thing out?
[01:44:30.225 --> 01:44:33.988]  Are we gonna keep just smelling the stench, you know, until we all get diseases from it?
[01:44:34.328 --> 01:44:35.969]  I mean, bottom line, in your guts,
[01:44:36.409 --> 01:44:37.670]  I mean, look at who has the motive.
[01:44:37.690 --> 01:44:40.232]  I mean, can you speak to motive for having these events?
[01:44:40.332 --> 01:44:44.775]  Why would the Arabs do something like this when it would bring down the biggest military on the planet on them?
[01:44:48.037 --> 01:44:49.138]  That's a pretty interesting question.
[01:44:50.479 --> 01:44:59.365]  There is an answer to that, and that would be if they were clever enough to suck us in to a Middle Eastern quagmire.
[01:44:59.405 --> 01:45:02.627]  We do appear to be in a quagmire, both in
[01:45:03.729 --> 01:45:13.934]  Iraq and in Afghanistan, where the activity is again heating up and we are now leaning on the British to put more troops in Afghanistan.
[01:45:13.954 --> 01:45:17.836]  But Bush said they wanted to have permanent bases there and wanted to have somewhat of a quagmire.
[01:45:17.856 --> 01:45:20.838]  I guess it's not this bad of a quagmire.
[01:45:21.918 --> 01:45:27.861]  You know, if we can't occupy Baghdad or control the road to the airport, I don't know how we're going to have a permanent base.
[01:45:29.182 --> 01:45:32.784]  But I agree with you that there's too many
[01:45:33.607 --> 01:45:37.869]  Reasons to disbelieve the government.
[01:45:37.889 --> 01:45:42.051]  There are too many problems with what they tell us.
[01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:43.552]  Well, Dr. Roberts, it's like this.
[01:45:44.072 --> 01:45:52.136]  If I had a neighbor for ten years who all he ever did was lie and cheat me, and then he said, hey, let me house-sit for you, why would I trust him?
[01:45:52.496 --> 01:45:54.497]  All the government does is lie and cheat us.
[01:45:54.557 --> 01:45:56.078]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:45:56.118 --> 01:45:58.619]  We still don't know about John F. Kennedy.
[01:46:00.231 --> 01:46:02.712]  Uh, we do know they lied about Ruby Ridge, Waco.
[01:46:02.952 --> 01:46:04.313]  We know they lied about Iraq.
[01:46:04.493 --> 01:46:07.554]  The Downing Street memos prove it beyond any question.
[01:46:07.634 --> 01:46:10.876]  Uh, Mr. Rodriguez, let's bring Mr. Rodriguez in here for a second with Dr. Roberts.
[01:46:11.316 --> 01:46:18.779]  Dr. Roberts, of course, uh, uh, was in the Reagan administration at a very, very high level as, uh, uh, there in the, uh, Treasury Department.
[01:46:19.099 --> 01:46:23.621]  But, uh, going back to Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Rodriguez, do you have any comments or questions for Mr. Roberts?
[01:46:23.801 --> 01:46:24.141]  Dr. Roberts?
[01:46:24.161 --> 01:46:25.161]  Well, I have a comment.
[01:46:25.382 --> 01:46:26.162]  Actually, uh,
[01:46:26.642 --> 01:46:35.207]  My group and the Skycraper Safety Campaign were the only two groups that went to Washington, to Congress, to ask for a commission to be created.
[01:46:35.247 --> 01:46:39.010]  We got the commission created, but it was after a big headache.
[01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:43.152]  You may remember that the President said, we don't need a commission, we already know who did it.
[01:46:43.632 --> 01:46:51.077]  And we said, no, the families of the victims have the right to know exactly what happened and what took us to that position.
[01:46:51.777 --> 01:47:03.605]  And after a lot of press, bad press, and a lot of manipulation, we have to put actually widows and mothers on TV to actually press for the White House to change the position.
[01:47:03.965 --> 01:47:05.286]  We have the 9-11 Commission.
[01:47:05.687 --> 01:47:09.989]  After we have the 9-11 Commission, we have them to pass subpoena power, which they never used.
[01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.430]  They didn't want the subpoena power.
[01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:12.791]  Let me ask Dr. Roberts this.
[01:47:12.811 --> 01:47:13.592]  You spurred a thought.
[01:47:13.892 --> 01:47:16.474]  Dr. Roberts, who could do a real investigation?
[01:47:16.734 --> 01:47:19.136]  We know Congress is so political and so partisan.
[01:47:19.416 --> 01:47:20.416]  It's not going to happen there.
[01:47:21.937 --> 01:47:22.218]  I don't know.
[01:47:22.238 --> 01:47:29.482]  I think what you're trying to do, what Mr. Rodriguez is trying to do, what other people whose integrity forces them to ask questions, which probably don't do them any good,
[01:47:48.723 --> 01:47:49.805]  I don't know.
[01:48:04.927 --> 01:48:11.089]  Over time of making, succeeding generations, best trusting on what the government tells them.
[01:48:11.429 --> 01:48:16.971]  But Doctor, what about Dick Cheney in the September 2000 PNAC document saying we need a Pearl Harbor?
[01:48:17.231 --> 01:48:28.095]  Or Zygmunt Brzezinski saying a helpful Pearl Harbor for imperial mobilization to mobilize the slaves, that's us, to go attack the barbarians.
[01:48:28.556 --> 01:48:32.317]  I mean these are the type of terms they use over and over again in government and in
[01:48:32.637 --> 01:48:36.518]  Well, it's been a notorious characteristic of governments for a long time.
[01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:10.835]  In the czarist government, in pre-Bolshevik Russia, the secret police used to carry out terrorist acts so they could go arrest people that they wanted to arrest.
[01:49:10.915 --> 01:49:11.636]  They blamed them.
[01:49:12.556 --> 01:49:15.638]  So those things do happen and have happened.
[01:49:16.738 --> 01:49:22.821]  And the question is about the World Trade Center.
[01:49:22.981 --> 01:49:26.003]  And I don't know the answer, but I agree that
[01:49:27.452 --> 01:49:36.479]  What we've been told seems to have problems and that the government is not very attentive to answering those problems.
[01:49:36.499 --> 01:49:44.226]  It has no indication of wanting to face these challenges and reply to them.
[01:49:44.326 --> 01:49:46.888]  So that tells me they're going to just ride over it.
[01:49:46.908 --> 01:49:48.729]  They're just going to ride over it the way they want.
[01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:49.029]  Stay there.
[01:49:49.410 --> 01:49:50.030]  We've got a break.
[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:52.132]  Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan.
[01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:57.634]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.874 --> 01:49:59.476]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.796 --> 01:50:04.482]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.823 --> 01:50:09.248]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:13.814]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.054 --> 01:50:16.897]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.997 --> 01:50:21.660]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.861 --> 01:50:26.284]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.504 --> 01:50:33.730]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.991 --> 01:50:36.413]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:53.769 --> 01:50:56.790]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:57.090 --> 01:51:02.011]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:02.271 --> 01:51:06.632]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.912 --> 01:51:15.834]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:16.034 --> 01:51:19.655]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.955 --> 01:51:24.980]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:31.987]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.481 --> 01:51:33.142]  What about you?
[01:51:33.782 --> 01:51:39.146]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:57.554 --> 01:51:58.414]  Look no further!

[01:52:10.845 --> 01:52:11.325]  I think so.
[01:52:27.875 --> 01:52:28.235]  I don't know.
[01:53:01.524 --> 01:53:06.694]  Folks, Dr. Roberts is going to leave us in five minutes, but I want to keep...
[01:53:07.418 --> 01:53:18.865]  Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Zemanski, on with us another 30 minutes to take your calls in the next hour and get into some other key points on 9-11 because it's the foundational event of this entire police state.
[01:53:19.305 --> 01:53:20.846]  Learn the truth about 9-11.
[01:53:20.906 --> 01:53:24.909]  Get my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:53:24.929 --> 01:53:29.071]  We detail how they do it, how they covered it up, who stands to gain.
[01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:31.152]  It's my best film, my third 9-11 film.
[01:53:32.688 --> 01:53:45.838]  Please get it today, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or order a copy at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:53:46.818 --> 01:53:57.206]  Dr. Roberts, of course, writes for CounterPunch.com, AntiWar.com, Newsmax.com of all places, and you can just type Paul Craig Roberts in and you'll see
[01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:58.270]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.496 --> 01:54:21.358]  And regardless of what happened on 9-11, I know what happened.
[01:54:21.378 --> 01:54:22.498]  You're now investigating it.
[01:54:23.078 --> 01:54:29.882]  But regardless, Dr. Roberts, they certainly are using it to destroy America while leaving the borders wide open, aren't they?
[01:54:31.123 --> 01:54:32.063]  That's for sure.
[01:54:32.443 --> 01:54:36.946]  We are losing our civil liberties very rapidly and the borders are wide open.
[01:54:37.046 --> 01:54:39.267]  And you know, something else I just remembered.
[01:54:39.607 --> 01:54:43.909]  You remember the Timothy McVeigh thing, the Murrah Building, the Oklahoma City bombing?
[01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:46.771]  There were a variety of experts.
[01:54:47.851 --> 01:54:51.613]  Including an Air Force General who was some sort of munitions expert.
[01:54:51.633 --> 01:54:54.255]  Ben K. Martin, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[01:54:54.295 --> 01:54:59.157]  Yeah, he only lived a couple blocks from me in Alexandria, Virginia.
[01:55:00.118 --> 01:55:01.679]  Inside the Beltway in Washington.
[01:55:01.799 --> 01:55:07.582]  And he said that that building blew up from the inside out.
[01:55:08.182 --> 01:55:10.764]  And I remember seeing a lot of accounts
[01:55:12.193 --> 01:55:12.693]  Of that.
[01:55:13.114 --> 01:55:14.254]  Well, I made a film about it.
[01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:18.557]  We have the police, the BATF ran up in their bomb gear seconds after the blast.
[01:55:18.817 --> 01:55:20.578]  They get, oh yeah, we were told not to come in.
[01:55:20.598 --> 01:55:22.560]  It's all on record, sir.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:25.401]  They have all the surveillance cameras, but they declared national security.
[01:55:26.222 --> 01:55:27.343]  Yes, I saw this.
[01:55:27.483 --> 01:55:35.688]  The government withholds so much information that... I mean, if they got McMay doing it, why not show the video, doctor?
[01:55:35.708 --> 01:55:36.528]  That's exactly right.
[01:55:36.568 --> 01:55:39.070]  If it supports their case, why don't they show it?
[01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:40.551]  So, I think that's
[01:55:41.394 --> 01:55:42.355]  I think so.
[01:55:59.318 --> 01:56:01.719]  About Iraq and the reason for the war.
[01:56:02.059 --> 01:56:05.180]  Well, Rumsfeld says he never said there were WMDs.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.041]  It's an urban legend, doctor.
[01:56:07.221 --> 01:56:09.842]  Does it matter if I have him on tape like a hundred times saying it?
[01:56:10.162 --> 01:56:18.945]  Well, people who will lie like that will lie about anything, and I think that is the point that people, the public, has to come to terms with.
[01:56:18.985 --> 01:56:28.489]  Has Bush stole the souls of a conservative America because so many of them mindlessly worship him when he is the 180 degree difference from conservatism?
[01:56:29.289 --> 01:56:30.810]  Well, yes he has.
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:35.413]  The question is whether he can keep them and whether they wake up.
[01:56:35.453 --> 01:56:39.215]  You see, most conservatives are fighting old battles.
[01:56:39.796 --> 01:56:48.161]  They're fighting the Vietnam War over or they're fighting Roe versus Wade over there and they're thinking about Bush in those terms.
[01:56:49.382 --> 01:56:54.245]  If it dawns on them that they've been deceived
[01:56:54.952 --> 01:56:56.474]  Well, yeah, you're right, Doctor.
[01:56:56.514 --> 01:57:00.178]  Conservatives think that if we discard Bush, that means we love Bill Clinton.
[01:57:14.293 --> 01:57:15.813]  And that's not the case, folks.
[01:57:15.833 --> 01:57:23.035]  We've got to discard both of these party hierarchies, and we can do that with the help of people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:57:23.375 --> 01:57:25.316]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:57:25.796 --> 01:57:27.256]  Well, you keep raising hell, Alex.
[01:57:27.336 --> 01:57:30.777]  It never hurts for Americans to raise hell.
[01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:32.978]  God bless you, sir.
[01:57:33.658 --> 01:57:38.559]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.086 --> 01:57:50.726]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.387 --> 01:57:52.448]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:54.250]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:55.731]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.492 --> 01:57:57.373]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.053 --> 01:58:01.737]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.238 --> 01:58:06.322]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.476 --> 01:58:14.977]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:14.997 --> 01:58:17.980]  We are now into hour number three.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.404]  It is Monday, the 47th day of June 2005.
[01:58:23.164 --> 01:58:27.888]  I got a bunch of news on Iraq, a bunch of news on the police state, other whistleblowers on 9-11.
[01:58:28.769 --> 01:58:40.599]  But in this hour, we're going to take your calls, and we've got William Rodriguez, one of the major heroes of 9-11, went back into the building to save people, had it collapse on him, and he was there in the basement when the bombs went off.
[01:58:41.244 --> 01:58:47.818]  And he's saying right before the plane even hit, and other witnesses have said that, and others were told to shut up about it.
[01:58:48.909 --> 01:58:59.619]  This is just part of this tapestry of ongoing lies, and Greg Zemensky, who is a prolific writer for AmericanFreePress.net, and just squadrons of other websites.
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:11.530]  His personal website is ArcticBeacon, and gentlemen, thanks for holding during that 25-minute interview with former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:14.453]  You know, when somebody pretty mainstream like Paul Craig Roberts
[01:59:15.073 --> 01:59:34.268]  Yeah, you know, it's nice to hear Paul's comments, and yeah, I mean, when you start getting people on board like this with the credibility of Mr. Roberts and others, the issue is going to have to be addressed.
[01:59:35.152 --> 01:59:40.296]  And I hope I hear the government start addressing some of these issues.
[01:59:40.336 --> 01:59:43.398]  I might add one lighter note, but not really a lighter note.
[01:59:44.459 --> 01:59:45.820]  There's a play going to be held.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.301]  This is the first one in the country.
[01:59:47.721 --> 01:59:48.762]  Oh, out in L.A., yeah.
[01:59:48.882 --> 01:59:49.543]  Hollywood.
[01:59:49.583 --> 01:59:51.484]  I just read a small story on that.
[01:59:51.824 --> 01:59:55.527]  And hopefully it's going to be the first stage play.
[01:59:55.547 --> 01:59:57.829]  It's going to be at the Met Theater starting July 17th.
[01:59:57.909 --> 01:59:59.690]  A two-hour play on 9-11.
[02:00:01.773 --> 02:00:06.360]  And it's done by a woman by the name of Sophia Shapkort is her name.
[02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:08.363]  I believe that's how you pronounce it.
[02:00:08.743 --> 02:00:11.167]  And she'd be somebody nice to talk to, Alex, so think about that.
[02:00:11.567 --> 02:00:13.731]  And they're doing a play on government involvement, right?
[02:00:14.401 --> 02:00:23.732]  Yeah, well, no, it's basically going to go through four segments, demolitions, the hijackers, war games, and then the last part is who benefits.
[02:00:23.792 --> 02:00:30.980]  So it's a real nice, I think they're using the visual medium, you know, the visual medium and they're going to put together a nice little...
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:35.542]  Well, I've seen these plays where they project video behind players on the stage.
[02:00:35.722 --> 02:00:36.703]  Yeah, they contacted me.
[02:00:36.723 --> 02:00:39.244]  They want to use William's story as an addition now.
[02:00:39.284 --> 02:00:40.624]  They're going to go through some artwork.
[02:00:40.644 --> 02:00:47.828]  I saw Philip K. Dick, Philip K. Dick's book, Flow My Tears The Policeman Said, that was done with those screens.
[02:00:48.148 --> 02:00:49.489]  It's a cool way to see a play.
[02:00:49.869 --> 02:00:54.011]  Yeah, and they're asking me maybe to do like a five minute intro.
[02:00:55.151 --> 02:01:01.956]  So I'm thinking about that right now, but that's a lady you should talk to, and hopefully some of the Hollywood stars will get on board to get the word across.
[02:01:02.136 --> 02:01:03.216]  Well done, Greg.
[02:01:03.256 --> 02:01:05.658]  Let's bring Mr. Rodriguez on.
[02:01:05.718 --> 02:01:10.741]  William, so many people have been standing up and telling the truth, but you were right there.
[02:01:10.781 --> 02:01:13.062]  You were a victim of this, and also a hero of this.
[02:01:13.422 --> 02:01:16.925]  Hearing Mr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts on, your comments.
[02:01:18.185 --> 02:01:24.129]  Well, again, it keeps opening new doors, and when you have somebody of that stature,
[02:01:25.166 --> 02:01:32.792]  You can't stop thinking, wow, this is an ex-high government official who is giving it to you the way it is.
[02:01:32.812 --> 02:01:34.554]  You know, this is the important thing.
[02:01:34.714 --> 02:01:43.162]  People like you, Alex, people like Greg Szymanski, people like Jimmy Walter, to open their mouth and actually put their reputation.
[02:01:44.002 --> 02:01:47.563]  Against the actual mainstream media, this is so important.
[02:01:47.943 --> 02:01:52.344]  I mean, in my position, I was tried in a way to be bought.
[02:01:53.085 --> 02:02:06.328]  You know, remember, they called me national hero, I was invited to the White House, I've been invited to a hundred different events, I have a room full of condecorations from different countries, and it's a way to buy you off.
[02:02:07.088 --> 02:02:10.269]  And when you don't have a clear mission,
[02:02:10.928 --> 02:02:15.855]  Uh, or where you going at, that you want to actually have the truth in front of you.
[02:02:16.215 --> 02:02:18.038]  That's what's going to happen to a lot of the people.
[02:02:18.378 --> 02:02:20.020]  People were bought left and right.
[02:02:20.381 --> 02:02:22.664]  And you know, a lot of it isn't even overt.
[02:02:22.764 --> 02:02:24.686]  It's just, hey, we're your friends.
[02:02:25.147 --> 02:02:26.389]  Go along with our story.
[02:02:26.989 --> 02:02:27.510]  Correct.
[02:02:46.599 --> 02:02:53.987]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.268 --> 02:02:59.013]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.233 --> 02:03:04.880]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:09.605]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.845 --> 02:03:17.013]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:17.033 --> 02:03:21.197]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.717 --> 02:03:24.239]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.

[02:05:50.224 --> 02:05:50.905]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.545 --> 02:05:52.586]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.306 --> 02:05:54.446]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.467 --> 02:05:55.907]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.927 --> 02:05:57.508]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.528 --> 02:06:02.150]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.391 --> 02:06:06.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.588 --> 02:06:22.434]  A fellow Patriot broadcaster, John Stattner, had a bad motorcycle accident over the weekend, for those that didn't know.
[02:06:22.454 --> 02:06:23.775]  He's okay.
[02:06:23.795 --> 02:06:28.059]  He broke his collarbone and clavicle and cracked, I think, 11 ribs.
[02:06:28.199 --> 02:06:29.360]  I talked to his wife this morning.
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:30.500]  I just learned of it this morning.
[02:06:30.881 --> 02:06:32.442]  I wish somebody would have called me over the weekend.
[02:06:34.213 --> 02:06:37.156]  Uh, and it's not foul play before the conspiracy theories start.
[02:06:37.196 --> 02:06:42.059]  Motorcycles are dangerous and there was some gravel or something on a road where they were doing construction.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.141]  She was following him in her van.
[02:06:44.982 --> 02:06:46.563]  And, uh, or she said following him.
[02:06:46.603 --> 02:06:47.544]  I don't know if it was her van.
[02:06:47.564 --> 02:06:48.144]  Oh, they have a van.
[02:06:48.825 --> 02:06:49.846]  There I am adding things.
[02:06:50.526 --> 02:06:52.448]  And, uh, he just slid out.
[02:06:53.488 --> 02:06:56.311]  And it was supposedly in traffic, too, so it's a good thing he didn't get run over.
[02:06:56.331 --> 02:06:57.191]  And, uh,
[02:06:58.582 --> 02:06:59.603]  Got hurt pretty bad.
[02:06:59.623 --> 02:07:02.085]  He's got like 12 stitches or 11 stitches somewhere.
[02:07:02.105 --> 02:07:04.807]  Again, broke over 10 ribs.
[02:07:05.688 --> 02:07:06.468]  But he's okay.
[02:07:06.508 --> 02:07:08.269]  He's making phone calls into talk shows.
[02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:12.112]  Just lets you know how transitory life is.
[02:07:12.152 --> 02:07:13.513]  Now we should all be thankful for it.
[02:07:13.974 --> 02:07:17.737]  We should pray for John, even though we've differed on quite a few things.
[02:07:18.017 --> 02:07:19.558]  People were kind of shocked when I called up.
[02:07:19.578 --> 02:07:21.099]  I've never had anything bad to say before.
[02:07:21.539 --> 02:07:22.680]  Other people have about me.
[02:07:23.001 --> 02:07:25.142]  I call in, oh, you're doing okay.
[02:07:25.442 --> 02:07:26.083]  Why are you calling?
[02:07:27.034 --> 02:07:27.694]  Worried about people.
[02:07:27.714 --> 02:07:28.435]  I'm a nice guy.
[02:07:28.715 --> 02:07:29.596]  That's what I do.
[02:07:29.616 --> 02:07:32.377]  I was worried about Clay Douglas.
[02:07:32.397 --> 02:07:36.980]  When Clay Douglas had his horrible motorcycle accident, I asked folks to send me money.
[02:07:37.561 --> 02:07:38.701]  He was really hurt badly.
[02:07:39.582 --> 02:07:41.063]  In and out of consciousness for weeks.
[02:07:41.803 --> 02:07:44.205]  But thank God John is not that bad off.
[02:07:46.026 --> 02:07:47.607]  But hey, it shows what you get.
[02:07:47.667 --> 02:07:51.469]  You write big news articles about me bad in your magazine, and I say send you money.
[02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:53.030]  I'm a bad guy, folks.
[02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:55.272]  You're going to really learn that as you listen more and more to the show.
[02:07:56.789 --> 02:07:57.910]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:07:57.950 --> 02:08:00.411]  But yeah, these motorcycles, folks, get rid of them.
[02:08:01.092 --> 02:08:03.873]  I've warned so many people, don't have a motorcycle.
[02:08:03.893 --> 02:08:05.654]  And they go, ah, I'm not going to have a wreck.
[02:08:05.794 --> 02:08:06.495]  Ah, I'm tough.
[02:08:07.315 --> 02:08:09.917]  Folks, they're deadly dangerous.
[02:08:10.817 --> 02:08:15.900]  And John is at Breckenridge and pray for him that he has a speedy recovery.
[02:08:17.041 --> 02:08:18.101]  And I'm sad it happened to him.
[02:08:18.121 --> 02:08:18.822]  He's a pretty good guy.
[02:08:20.162 --> 02:08:22.123]  Let's go back to our guest.
[02:08:22.283 --> 02:08:31.285]  We're talking to Greg Zeminski, who is a prolific writer on 9-11 and other key issues, and of course, a hero of 9-11, William Rodriguez.
[02:08:32.066 --> 02:08:34.006]  William and Greg, we have loaded phones.
[02:08:34.046 --> 02:08:35.087]  You guys want to go to the calls?
[02:08:35.547 --> 02:08:36.107]  Yes, of course.
[02:08:36.147 --> 02:08:36.407]  Go ahead.
[02:08:36.447 --> 02:08:36.967]  I want to do it.
[02:08:37.067 --> 02:08:37.547]  Definitely.
[02:08:37.847 --> 02:08:40.908]  Okay, let's go to Andrew in New York.
[02:08:40.948 --> 02:08:42.129]  You are on the air with our guest.
[02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.789]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[02:08:43.529 --> 02:08:44.429]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:08:44.489 --> 02:08:45.370]  I want it all for
[02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:55.018]  Trying to come to some answers for some of us that, well, we need people out there asking questions.
[02:08:55.198 --> 02:09:05.869]  But I have one quick question and that is, did anybody save their clothing from when the buildings were exploded for residue testing of explosives?
[02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:15.318]  Actually, I have my clothing when I was from the rubble and actually after that I was washed with water from the Hudson River.
[02:09:15.659 --> 02:09:21.063]  They have a pump to actually take all the debris from your face and your body and I was actually washed down there.
[02:09:21.463 --> 02:09:25.966]  But I still have stuff in their pockets, like dust and stuff like that.
[02:09:26.407 --> 02:09:28.688]  So I do still have those clothing.
[02:09:28.909 --> 02:09:31.490]  Oh, you need to get that tested immediately.
[02:09:32.751 --> 02:09:34.172]  That's why I love calls.
[02:09:34.192 --> 02:09:36.034]  The callers bring up stuff we didn't think of.
[02:09:36.998 --> 02:09:43.422]  Also, again, let's talk about how they hauled that debris away, even though the victim's family said, please don't do it, it's a cover-up.
[02:09:44.082 --> 02:09:45.083]  Greg?
[02:09:45.223 --> 02:09:46.303]  It's not only that.
[02:09:46.503 --> 02:09:53.067]  The actual... One of the questions on the news two days ago was, what kind of testing did you do?
[02:09:53.127 --> 02:09:55.388]  I said, well, we have the actual steel.
[02:09:55.408 --> 02:09:56.929]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[02:09:57.229 --> 02:10:02.792]  You have the steel almost a year and a half after, because the actual steel was sold to China and Korea.
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:10.002]  Yeah, Phil Berg's written about that in his complaint.
[02:10:10.762 --> 02:10:14.764]  And other people have written stories about FEMA's quick actions that day.
[02:10:15.064 --> 02:10:20.607]  Basically, they were nearby doing some kind of FEMA... Tripod tube!
[02:10:20.787 --> 02:10:21.707]  Yeah, nearby.
[02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:26.729]  And as soon as the thing hit the cordon, that thing off, nobody got a chance to get the evidence.
[02:10:26.749 --> 02:10:30.391]  And only their official cameras were allowed to videotape the wreckage.
[02:10:30.891 --> 02:10:35.814]  Yeah, it was a pretty interesting situation why FEMA blocked everything off.
[02:10:35.834 --> 02:10:37.314]  Then they immediately get the rubble out.
[02:10:37.374 --> 02:10:45.059]  I even had stories where they were so concerned about the rubble that they had GPS tracking on every truck that left.
[02:10:45.699 --> 02:10:49.601]  And also, a gentleman who was driving a truck, which I haven't been able to verify yet,
[02:10:51.503 --> 02:10:54.566]  No, no, I've confirmed that.
[02:10:54.606 --> 02:10:56.869]  I've seen that report.
[02:10:58.411 --> 02:11:04.698]  Listen, did you know in the Oklahoma City bombing, folks, it blew out and then the news reported it showed them removing bombs.
[02:11:04.778 --> 02:11:05.979]  I have all this in Road to Tyranny.
[02:11:06.219 --> 02:11:06.700]  This is key.
[02:11:07.737 --> 02:11:08.978]  This is very important.
[02:11:08.998 --> 02:11:12.260]  Most of the building wasn't destroyed.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.282]  Well, when Control Demolition Inc.
[02:11:14.322 --> 02:11:27.251]  blew it up, blew up the wreckage, they hauled it away under armed guard, buried it in a landfill, poured concrete in with the chunks, and have armed guards with Heckler & Koch MP5s.
[02:11:27.371 --> 02:11:29.953]  They're guarding it to this day, ten years later.
[02:11:32.214 --> 02:11:36.858]  Just to add to that, you have, for example, Diane Horning, who has
[02:11:37.754 --> 02:11:51.180]  An organization of family members who is trying to get the actual remains from the city dump where they put everything from the workplace entered and she has been unsuccessful to get a proper burial for these people.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:12:00.544]  Now for those that don't know, there were the remains of literally thousands of people in there and they just know we're putting it in the dump and then shipping it to China.
[02:12:01.605 --> 02:12:01.825]  Correct.
[02:12:02.941 --> 02:12:09.550]  Yeah, basically they covered a crime scene, even in the simplest, in a single murder in New York.
[02:12:10.739 --> 02:12:13.900]  The evidence is not tampered with and the tapes go up and the evidence is there.
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:16.621]  Do you want to know where else they dumped concrete in all the chunks?
[02:12:17.242 --> 02:12:19.522]  Waco, 1993, April 19th.
[02:12:19.562 --> 02:12:20.583]  They torched the church.
[02:12:21.263 --> 02:12:25.805]  Inside the church records vault where they put a shape charge to kill the women and children.
[02:12:26.165 --> 02:12:29.966]  And Benton Parton is on record on that as well from the photos we have of it.
[02:12:30.306 --> 02:12:34.328]  We built a memorial chapel for all those that died up in Waco.
[02:12:35.391 --> 02:12:39.332]  And we had the concrete trucks coming.
[02:12:39.372 --> 02:12:42.173]  Now I knew they took it to two different landfills.
[02:12:42.393 --> 02:12:44.934]  I knew they scraped off about a foot of the topsoil.
[02:12:45.754 --> 02:13:00.018]  But what I didn't know is they had it buried in private landfills and concrete trucks lined up dumping concrete in with it trying to seal it all up so even archaeologists would have trouble getting it a hundred years from now.
[02:13:00.218 --> 02:13:01.678]  Gentlemen, what does that sound like to you?
[02:13:02.859 --> 02:13:03.399]  A cover-up.
[02:13:06.098 --> 02:13:08.122]  I mean, why do they do this in Oklahoma and Waco?
[02:13:08.182 --> 02:13:09.766]  Dump concrete in with the chunklets?
[02:13:11.088 --> 02:13:11.730]  It's incredible.
[02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.651]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:13:12.671 --> 02:13:13.353]  Stop amazing me.
[02:13:14.133 --> 02:13:17.455]  You know, sometimes you've got to take this down to a human level.
[02:13:18.616 --> 02:13:20.177]  I just had this great thought.
[02:13:20.237 --> 02:13:23.479]  I sit here and I write this story about William.
[02:13:23.519 --> 02:13:32.946]  One thing in the back of my mind I think about, and that's President Bush likes to talk about how he's the president of the people and the president of NASCAR.
[02:13:33.286 --> 02:13:35.508]  He likes to sit and have a beer with everybody.
[02:13:35.528 --> 02:13:36.708]  He can talk to anybody.
[02:13:36.728 --> 02:13:43.213]  Well, I'm going to say right now, Mr. President, why don't you sit and have a beer with Mr. Rodriguez and answer some of his questions?
[02:13:43.999 --> 02:13:45.180]  That is true, that is true.
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:52.025]  And actually, I'm glad that you mentioned Phil Berry, because actually I put up, I am the plaintiff of the lawsuit against the President.
[02:13:52.325 --> 02:14:02.733]  It's a recall lawsuit, and people can actually go to the website and petition, sign the petition of this to go actually to the Federal Court.
[02:14:02.774 --> 02:14:04.655]  We already went to the first level.
[02:14:04.955 --> 02:14:05.976]  What website is that?
[02:14:06.677 --> 02:14:08.018]  It's www.911forthetruth.com.
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.262]  9-1-1 for the truth dot com.
[02:14:13.302 --> 02:14:17.305]  Again, Mr. Rodriguez is on an internet phone, that's why you hear that cutting out.
[02:14:17.946 --> 02:14:18.827]  We'll give that out again.
[02:14:19.888 --> 02:14:21.649]  Yeah, 9-1-1 for the truth dot com.
[02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:27.935]  But if anybody wants to contact me after the show, they can do it through you, through your show.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:43.132]  And I'd be available for any kind of questions or any kind of requests as long as... Well, we're going to be having you back on and I want you to send me the substantive video and I'll get it out and put it on the web and millions will see it because this needs to be seen.
[02:14:43.152 --> 02:14:45.675]  I need to do a little mini video report and maybe Greg can write about it.
[02:14:45.695 --> 02:14:47.416]  Let's go to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:14:47.456 --> 02:14:48.197]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[02:14:48.217 --> 02:14:50.299]  You're on the air with Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:14:50.579 --> 02:14:51.780]  Go ahead.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.802]  Before I called you, I saw some
[02:14:54.925 --> 02:15:00.664]  74.
[02:14:54.945 --> 02:15:00.664]  Have respect under the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
[02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:13.087]  And something that I heard this morning on GCN is so disturbing and ominous that I went to prayer who to reach, you or Dr. Stan or who, and I felt the Lord told me, you are the only one who will bring this out.
[02:15:13.447 --> 02:15:20.350]  And hearing this good program again, this bridal program with Greg and with Mr. Rodriguez, I congratulate them.
[02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:27.674]  And very quickly, not to waste your time, what I did hear was Janet C. Phelan, who was a reporter at the St.
[02:15:27.914 --> 02:15:30.315]  Monica Daily Press,
[02:15:31.099 --> 02:15:36.770]  And she was looking into something very ominous and strange going on with the waterworks that's coming in St.
[02:15:36.831 --> 02:15:38.894]  Louis, she said, Vermont, and Houston.
[02:15:39.463 --> 02:15:43.727]  And actually, the title of her thing is Public Extermination Project.
[02:15:44.227 --> 02:15:48.471]  And she can get no answers, and just like Greg, she can't get the press.
[02:15:48.531 --> 02:15:50.873]  She resigned after she saw their attitude.
[02:15:50.893 --> 02:15:52.495]  Now, who is she?
[02:15:52.515 --> 02:15:55.757]  Alright, she's Janet C. Phelan.
[02:15:55.857 --> 02:15:57.539]  P-H-E-L-A-N.
[02:15:57.959 --> 02:16:02.483]  And her email address is JC... Janet, hold on, let's go slower here.
[02:16:02.944 --> 02:16:04.585]  Because your phone's cutting out.
[02:16:04.605 --> 02:16:05.246]  Janet what?
[02:16:05.826 --> 02:16:08.368]  Janet C. Phelan.
[02:16:08.869 --> 02:16:11.011]  P-H-E-L-A-N.
[02:16:11.031 --> 02:16:11.611]  Oh, I got that.
[02:16:11.631 --> 02:16:12.592]  Janet C. Phelan.
[02:16:12.652 --> 02:16:14.193]  Right, and here's her e-mail.
[02:16:14.374 --> 02:16:15.074]  I mean, who is she?
[02:16:15.094 --> 02:16:15.915]  Who does she work for?
[02:16:15.935 --> 02:16:17.556]  She works for the St.
[02:16:17.616 --> 02:16:19.578]  Monica... Where am I staying here?
[02:16:19.618 --> 02:16:19.858]  St.
[02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:22.000]  Monica in California.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:22.741]  Daily Press.
[02:16:22.781 --> 02:16:23.421]  Santa Monica.
[02:16:23.461 --> 02:16:24.202]  Santa... Yes.
[02:16:24.382 --> 02:16:24.762]  Okay.
[02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:25.623]  I'm a little nervous.
[02:16:25.683 --> 02:16:26.544]  I've waited a long time.
[02:16:26.584 --> 02:16:27.064]  A lot was going on.
[02:16:27.084 --> 02:16:29.647]  And she found out about something called a public extermination?
[02:16:29.667 --> 02:16:33.370]  She found out about T-valves being used
[02:16:33.974 --> 02:16:45.823]  And, uh, this was happening in the Palisades Park area, and she just now has an article sitting on Henry Waxman's desk requesting that he honor her request to address Congress.
[02:16:45.843 --> 02:16:46.323]  I mean, be specific.
[02:16:46.343 --> 02:16:48.505]  I mean, just in a nutshell, what is she saying they're doing?
[02:16:48.965 --> 02:16:53.668]  Alright, there's something going on where they can close off this stuff, these T-valves.
[02:16:53.688 --> 02:16:55.169]  See, I didn't hear everything.
[02:16:55.189 --> 02:16:56.991]  Okay, how does that kill us?
[02:16:57.491 --> 02:17:00.013]  Uh, they can do something with the water.
[02:17:00.533 --> 02:17:07.860]  And there was more to it, so I really suggest you check with her, jcphalen10 at yahoo.com.
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:10.643]  jcphalen10 at yahoo.com.
[02:17:11.224 --> 02:17:16.228]  And, you know, I think this is something that it could be disinformation, but I trust you.
[02:17:16.308 --> 02:17:19.552]  You don't have a lot of the New Age stuff on your program.
[02:17:19.932 --> 02:17:22.995]  I believe that you and Dr. Stan are true blue.
[02:17:23.515 --> 02:17:24.957]  And what alarmed me was
[02:17:25.853 --> 02:17:36.460]  I was just reading in Bob Rosio's book about how at the end of World War II, they found there was enough Zyklon D gas left to kill millions more.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.422]  Look, I'll try to track this down and get it exactly what you're talking about.
[02:17:39.442 --> 02:17:40.063]  Thank you so much.
[02:17:40.083 --> 02:17:41.944]  We'll let our guests comment on that.
[02:17:42.184 --> 02:17:44.866]  If our government will do all this, what else might they do?
[02:17:46.076 --> 02:17:49.118]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[02:17:49.359 --> 02:17:51.140]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:55.003]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:17:55.303 --> 02:18:01.167]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:18:01.287 --> 02:18:03.249]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[02:18:03.389 --> 02:18:07.252]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:18:07.572 --> 02:18:11.256]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[02:18:11.437 --> 02:18:16.262]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[02:18:16.402 --> 02:18:21.408]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.

[02:18:45.874 --> 02:18:47.494]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:18:47.634 --> 02:18:51.755]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:51.875 --> 02:18:54.756]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:54.836 --> 02:19:01.557]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:19:01.717 --> 02:19:04.738]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:19:04.938 --> 02:19:07.319]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:07.459 --> 02:19:13.200]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethyl
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:13.640]  I don't know.
[02:19:37.065 --> 02:19:37.105]  808-803-4438.

[02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:46.009]  Gold.

[02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:53.971]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:54.151 --> 02:19:57.972]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:58.332 --> 02:20:00.212]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:00.252 --> 02:20:02.573]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:02.693 --> 02:20:09.374]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:20:09.394 --> 02:20:09.814]  We're good.
[02:20:24.531 --> 02:20:31.193]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[02:20:34.094 --> 02:20:40.457]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[02:20:45.018 --> 02:20:48.400]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[02:20:48.981 --> 02:20:51.943]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[02:21:56.252 --> 02:21:57.433]  Jack Belov called in.
[02:21:57.453 --> 02:21:58.334]  We're honored to have him.
[02:21:58.394 --> 02:22:01.818]  Talk show host that comes on right after this broadcast every day at 2 o'clock.
[02:22:02.619 --> 02:22:12.550]  Jack had a question for Greg Zeminski and for William Rodriguez, one of the heroes of 9-11 blowing the whistle about bombs in the buildings.
[02:22:13.271 --> 02:22:15.133]  Jack, who would you like to address first?
[02:22:15.273 --> 02:22:16.814]  Well, thanks again for putting me on.
[02:22:16.854 --> 02:22:19.696]  I don't want to take up too much time away from the other listeners.
[02:22:19.796 --> 02:22:23.418]  I congratulate you and all your guests today for just doing a fantastic job.
[02:22:23.998 --> 02:22:32.644]  First, William Rodriguez, who was on my program four or five months ago, I don't know if I missed it, but he was talking on my program about meeting Muhammad Ata.
[02:22:32.964 --> 02:22:33.324]  Take care, Jack.
[02:22:33.364 --> 02:22:35.805]  Yes, Mr. Rodriguez, you say that you might have seen some of the hijackers before 9-11?
[02:22:57.950 --> 02:23:04.736]  Commission behind closed doors that I saw, it wasn't Mohamed Atta, it was Mohamed Al-Shughiri.
[02:23:04.796 --> 02:23:07.818]  I'll tell you what, start over because we didn't have you sign it up right at the first.
[02:23:07.838 --> 02:23:08.599]  Start over, go ahead.
[02:23:09.299 --> 02:23:26.713]  Okay, I did testify for the 9-11 Commission behind closed doors and I told them that I saw one of the hijackers, Mohamed Al-Shughiri, no more Mohamed Atta, Mohamed Al-Shughiri, and that actually he was taking the building because actually on that day
[02:23:27.854 --> 02:23:34.582]  I was cleaning the bathrooms on the middle of the complex and he was asking how many public bathrooms were available.
[02:23:35.023 --> 02:23:47.838]  The commission investigators were very angry because I told this to the FBI and I kept quiet for several years thinking that there was an official investigation and then I realized that they didn't do anything about the information that I gave them.
[02:23:48.517 --> 02:24:07.574]  And they were very angry, the investigators, because they said, here is not only an eyewitness account that one of the hijackers was inside the building, and number two, that they have a second alternate plan, which was to actually place bombs in the public bathrooms to actually accelerate the fall of the building.
[02:24:08.134 --> 02:24:11.677]  Now, this is not me saying this, this is the actual investigators speculating.
[02:24:11.957 --> 02:24:13.719]  Now, the investigators worked for the Commission.
[02:24:14.441 --> 02:24:18.544]  And the Commission never put that statement on the final report.
[02:24:19.044 --> 02:24:30.132]  My statement, I don't know how the media found out, the Daily News contacted me that they knew I testified about seeing one of the hijackers.
[02:24:30.473 --> 02:24:37.758]  They put it on the newspaper as an exclusive, and I got only two calls from the national media to talk about it, and then it never went on the air.
[02:24:38.602 --> 02:24:50.927]  And again, this is the incredible thing that on the Latino community, I mean I'm from Puerto Rico, but I have created the first family group which is the Hispanic Victims Group.
[02:24:51.407 --> 02:24:57.110]  I went national and then international all over Latin America with all these statements.
[02:24:57.790 --> 02:25:04.473]  I mean, I've been the subject of over 17 different television specials, but all in Spanish.
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.203]  Nothing in English.
[02:25:06.484 --> 02:25:09.051]  It's like the story has been totally ignored in English.
[02:25:10.014 --> 02:25:12.120]  Total media control, Greg Zemeski.
[02:25:13.015 --> 02:25:18.100]  Well, you know, I think it was Jack, wasn't it, that asked that question about the... Yeah, Jack Blodgett.
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:18.500]  Yeah.
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.683]  Well, that basically is a story about a story, and it's very interesting.
[02:25:21.723 --> 02:25:29.509]  Bob Kohler, who's a well-respected... He works for Tribune Media Services, and he's an editor for the subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune.
[02:25:29.569 --> 02:25:36.015]  And what he does is he edits national columns that go all over the country, but he's also created his own column over the years.
[02:25:37.436 --> 02:25:45.563]  Basically, he did a story which said the election was stolen, and he sent it out to the papers, one being the Tribune, one of his customers, and they didn't run it.
[02:25:46.143 --> 02:25:49.326]  But they chose to run a rebuttal, calling him a conspiracy nut.
[02:25:49.986 --> 02:25:58.233]  Well, this upset Bob, and I talked to Bob at length on this story, and ran a story about him, because I thought it was quite interesting, and explained the media hush and cover-up.
[02:25:58.693 --> 02:26:01.816]  Well, basically, Bob was going to write a rebuttal to the rebuttal.
[02:26:02.616 --> 02:26:06.501]  But decided against it because he didn't want it to seem like just an in-house squabble.
[02:26:07.021 --> 02:26:10.245]  But basically, finally got a letter to the editor, printed the Tribune.
[02:26:10.365 --> 02:26:13.569]  Well, the story never appeared, and he said very few people print anything.
[02:26:13.589 --> 02:26:19.155]  He only has 12 clients across the country, but when he runs stories like that, people don't run them.
[02:26:19.555 --> 02:26:23.420]  So it shows you, basically, the Tribune hushes up their own people.
[02:26:24.341 --> 02:26:26.324]  And he basically, I said, Bob, is your job in jeopardy?
[02:26:26.344 --> 02:26:28.287]  He said, no, but it was a definite body blow.
[02:26:28.768 --> 02:26:31.672]  And it definitely shows you what's going on in the newsroom today.
[02:26:31.692 --> 02:26:34.917]  Knocked him down in a sweetheart rung and got dropped off some columns.
[02:26:35.438 --> 02:26:35.699]  What's that?
[02:26:36.728 --> 02:26:37.868]  Knocked him down or wrong?
[02:26:38.188 --> 02:26:38.669]  Oh, of course!
[02:26:38.729 --> 02:26:40.449]  And Bob, you'd love to have him on.
[02:26:40.509 --> 02:26:44.190]  It'll tell you what the mainstream, what, you know, he's one of the few renegades in the mainstream media.
[02:26:44.210 --> 02:26:51.872]  Well, look, totally, clearly, I mean, the Democratic Party is totally corrupt, totally evil, just like the Republicans, but they can't just steal an election.
[02:26:51.912 --> 02:27:02.275]  They've then got to have Kerry take a dive, which he did do, but clearly Al Gore won in 2000, clearly in November of 2004, John Forbes Kerry won.
[02:27:02.615 --> 02:27:02.975]  Exactly.
[02:27:02.995 --> 02:27:04.916]  I mean, look at these approval ratings now, but again,
[02:27:05.966 --> 02:27:08.007]  It doesn't mean I'm for Kerry or Al Gore.
[02:27:08.047 --> 02:27:14.769]  It just shows that even when they give us two false choices, they then pick which of the choices we get, even when we pick the other one.
[02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:17.410]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:18.251]  Banana Republic.
[02:27:18.451 --> 02:27:19.311]  It's very nice.
[02:27:19.571 --> 02:27:21.392]  Gentlemen, you want to keep riding the shotgun with us?
[02:27:21.972 --> 02:27:22.172]  Sure.
[02:27:22.732 --> 02:27:24.133]  How about you, Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:27:24.793 --> 02:27:25.033]  Sure.
[02:27:25.493 --> 02:27:26.954]  Al, we're really honored to have you, sir.
[02:27:26.994 --> 02:27:27.954]  We'll give that website out again.
[02:27:27.974 --> 02:27:32.456]  We'll come back and talk to Mike and Victor and Mark and many others.
[02:27:32.516 --> 02:27:33.016]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.016 --> 02:27:36.956]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.397 --> 02:27:39.037]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.938 --> 02:27:42.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.221 --> 02:27:55.044]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:27:55.344 --> 02:27:57.685]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:27:57.945 --> 02:27:59.906]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:28:00.246 --> 02:28:05.588]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:28:05.988 --> 02:28:10.251]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:28:10.711 --> 02:28:18.616]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[02:28:18.796 --> 02:28:23.840]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:25.861]  military and numerous other government agencies.

[02:28:59.365 --> 02:29:04.046]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.506 --> 02:29:11.234]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.634 --> 02:29:23.407]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.887 --> 02:29:28.352]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:31:18.722 --> 02:31:19.582]  Well, frankly, all of them.
[02:31:19.722 --> 02:31:20.443]  They're all excellent.
[02:31:21.344 --> 02:31:30.912]  And we're going to go to your calls and then I'm going to give Greg and William a chance to just talk about anything they think is important to reiterate or anything we haven't covered.
[02:31:30.932 --> 02:31:32.433]  But let's get a lot of these callers out of the way.
[02:31:32.753 --> 02:31:35.296]  Callers, I'm going to go to you quickly to have your question or comment ready.
[02:31:35.656 --> 02:31:36.777]  Mark in Texas, go ahead.
[02:31:39.372 --> 02:31:39.893]  Hello, Mark.
[02:31:40.193 --> 02:31:40.953]  Yes, welcome.
[02:31:41.314 --> 02:31:41.874]  Welcome, thank you.
[02:31:42.114 --> 02:31:45.337]  I'm trying to get the exact chronology straight here with Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:31:46.158 --> 02:31:57.408]  He was in the basement at 8.45 in the morning when the first explosion that he felt occurred, and then how many seconds after that?
[02:31:58.211 --> 02:31:59.332]  What did the plane do?
[02:31:59.552 --> 02:32:02.694]  Probably, uh, two or three seconds after that.
[02:32:02.714 --> 02:32:03.815]  Two or three seconds after that?
[02:32:03.855 --> 02:32:09.919]  He gave me the time to think, wow, this is an explosion from one of the electrical generators on the basement.
[02:32:10.559 --> 02:32:10.779]  Okay.
[02:32:10.799 --> 02:32:14.942]  That's exactly the time that it took for then the second explosion that came from the top.
[02:32:14.962 --> 02:32:19.065]  So, boom, shake, oh, I bet that's the generators, I bet that's what happened, boom.
[02:32:19.805 --> 02:32:20.185]  Correct.
[02:32:20.486 --> 02:32:23.348]  And the second boom was above you, and that was the plane?
[02:32:23.428 --> 02:32:26.930]  Way above, and you could hear it, that it was from pretty far away.
[02:32:27.668 --> 02:32:28.009]  All right.
[02:32:28.409 --> 02:32:30.633]  Then there was yet another explosion beneath you.
[02:32:30.693 --> 02:32:31.795]  Another explosion.
[02:32:32.136 --> 02:32:39.408]  What I was explained was that actually once the plane hit
[02:32:39.952 --> 02:32:43.475]  The wings blew up because he has all the gasoline on the wings.
[02:32:43.975 --> 02:32:46.177]  So that was several explosions that you heard.
[02:32:46.577 --> 02:32:50.861]  But then the funny thing is that as I testified and that is that I went.
[02:32:51.541 --> 02:32:58.527]  One thing that one fact that I haven't talked about is that I have the only master key that was used on the North Tower.
[02:32:58.807 --> 02:33:02.110]  There were five master keys in the building and I have one of them.
[02:33:02.515 --> 02:33:09.459]  And I was followed by the fire department as I went up the stairwells, opening the doors so people could get out from the offices.
[02:33:09.939 --> 02:33:12.921]  And as I went up, I heard explosions on the lower floors.
[02:33:13.781 --> 02:33:18.084]  I'm talking about in between the 20th and the 30th floor.
[02:33:18.844 --> 02:33:26.528]  And once I got to the 33rd floor, on the 33rd floor, I was by myself because the whole fire unit collapsed on the 27th floor.
[02:33:28.044 --> 02:33:34.230]  And I continued by myself, and then I found a lady on the floor, on the 33rd floor, trembling.
[02:33:34.570 --> 02:33:36.632]  I stood her up, put her on the stairwell.
[02:33:37.125 --> 02:33:38.606]  And then I heard something very strange.
[02:33:39.007 --> 02:33:41.609]  On the 34th floor, I heard strange movement.
[02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:52.599]  Now, when I say strange movement, it's like heavy equipment, like dumpsters with those metal wheels being moved around the floor.
[02:33:52.999 --> 02:33:58.964]  Now, the strange thing is that that floor is an empty, hollowed-out construction floor.
[02:33:59.044 --> 02:34:00.285]  There was nobody there.
[02:34:00.546 --> 02:34:03.949]  There was no equipment, supposedly, on that floor.
[02:34:04.589 --> 02:34:06.912]  So I got scared because I was by myself.
[02:34:07.332 --> 02:34:12.177]  So I could bypass that floor with the master key and continue to the other upper floors.
[02:34:12.657 --> 02:34:15.580]  So I did explain that and I never got an answer about that.
[02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:21.706]  And what were the, did you hear explosions just before the building collapsed around you at the end or how did that?
[02:34:22.688 --> 02:34:25.030]  Yes, well actually, I went up the stairwells.
[02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:27.751]  I heard a lot of mini explosions.
[02:34:28.232 --> 02:34:30.793]  And then on the 39th floor, I got up to the 39th floor.
[02:34:31.054 --> 02:34:39.659]  On the 39th floor, the police officer that was with me on the lower levels actually met me from the opposite stairwell.
[02:34:39.959 --> 02:34:45.583]  There were three stairwells, A, B, and C. I was on the B, and he came from the A staircase.
[02:34:46.123 --> 02:34:49.906]  And we met practically in front of the doorframe.
[02:34:50.685 --> 02:34:57.372]  He was with two firemen, and at that moment we were talking about what was going to be the next course of action, when BOOM!
[02:34:57.712 --> 02:35:00.175]  We hear the impact on the other building.
[02:35:00.495 --> 02:35:04.419]  Now, we don't know that it's another plane, because we're inside the stairwells.
[02:35:04.847 --> 02:35:06.388]  So, we have no idea what's going on.
[02:35:06.709 --> 02:35:27.366]  And as we hear the boom on the building, all of a sudden we hear BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM B
[02:35:28.044 --> 02:35:28.965]  Correct.
[02:35:28.985 --> 02:35:32.388]  Because we have firefighters saying, it was as if they had detonated.
[02:35:32.448 --> 02:35:33.549]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:35:33.589 --> 02:35:35.150]  And we have those clips.
[02:35:36.011 --> 02:35:37.572]  It sounded just exactly like that.
[02:35:37.952 --> 02:35:43.677]  And what they explained to me was that the building was collapsing inside before it actually collapsed outside.
[02:35:44.197 --> 02:35:45.499]  Which it didn't make sense to me.
[02:35:45.699 --> 02:35:46.539]  Well, that's what it showed.
[02:35:46.579 --> 02:35:48.201]  Little explosions going down the side.
[02:35:48.261 --> 02:35:48.921]  Then it collapsed.
[02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:51.343]  That's how a controlled demolition happens.
[02:35:51.363 --> 02:35:52.424]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[02:35:52.765 --> 02:35:53.645]  Really good questions.
[02:35:53.925 --> 02:35:55.427]  I want to get to everybody real fast.
[02:35:55.687 --> 02:35:56.668]  Greg Zemensky, comments?
[02:35:57.849 --> 02:35:58.909]  No, go ahead Alec.
[02:35:58.930 --> 02:35:59.490]  Get your call.
[02:35:59.810 --> 02:36:01.950]  Alright, let's go to Mike in New York.
[02:36:02.010 --> 02:36:02.811]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:36:02.831 --> 02:36:03.191]  Welcome.
[02:36:06.792 --> 02:36:09.493]  Mike's been holding for eons and must have decided not to hold any longer.
[02:36:09.593 --> 02:36:12.294]  Victor in Missouri.
[02:36:12.354 --> 02:36:13.054]  Victor, go ahead.
[02:36:13.074 --> 02:36:13.674]  Hey guys.
[02:36:14.334 --> 02:36:14.734]  Hello.
[02:36:14.854 --> 02:36:24.257]  All this Waco, Ruby Ridge, the Murrah Building, all these are symptoms of the real problem, which is the monster in Washington.
[02:36:25.278 --> 02:36:25.998]  And it feeds
[02:36:26.534 --> 02:36:30.377]  On misplaced respect and honor and Federal Reserve notes.
[02:36:31.097 --> 02:36:32.298]  And you know how to kill a monster?
[02:36:33.018 --> 02:36:36.701]  You stop feeding the damn thing and calling it government.
[02:36:38.082 --> 02:36:41.004]  Well, it is an organized crime syndicate masterwriting as government.
[02:36:41.284 --> 02:36:41.724]  That's right.
[02:36:41.844 --> 02:36:46.668]  And as long as we even call it or refer to it... Well, it's just like the Mafia, too.
[02:36:46.728 --> 02:36:48.028]  It gives us loans.
[02:36:48.089 --> 02:36:48.949]  It gives us money.
[02:36:49.029 --> 02:36:51.731]  It gets us dependent on it, but only for control.
[02:36:52.151 --> 02:36:54.653]  I really don't think the Mafia is as bad as that thing in Washington.
[02:36:55.703 --> 02:36:56.464]  Well, it is the Mafia.
[02:36:56.484 --> 02:36:56.945]  It's the Super Mafia.
[02:36:56.965 --> 02:36:59.149]  Anyway, if you stop feeding it, it'll buy or go away.
[02:36:59.650 --> 02:37:01.213]  Any comments or questions for our guest?
[02:37:01.273 --> 02:37:01.814]  That was it.
[02:37:02.982 --> 02:37:03.723]  Victor, thank you.
[02:37:03.763 --> 02:37:03.983]  Comments?
[02:37:04.003 --> 02:37:04.463]  You're very welcome.
[02:37:04.763 --> 02:37:06.425]  Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:37:06.885 --> 02:37:08.626]  Mr. Zemensky, any comments on what he just said?
[02:37:09.026 --> 02:37:19.053]  Yeah, all I wanted to say was that for a gentleman like this, that we have to take this on a daily basis and continue to have our stories told and to continue on a daily basis.
[02:37:19.133 --> 02:37:19.473]  Exactly!
[02:37:19.553 --> 02:37:25.237]  People think it's this instant gratification society of wanting the hamburger in 60 seconds or we get angry.
[02:37:25.657 --> 02:37:27.259]  Folks, it's gonna take time.
[02:37:27.319 --> 02:37:29.280]  I love that movie, The Guns of Navarone.
[02:37:30.201 --> 02:37:34.970]  And then in the part two of it, Force 10 from Navarone, you ever seen Force 10 from Navarone?
[02:37:35.691 --> 02:37:36.112]  I haven't, no.
[02:37:36.132 --> 02:37:36.753]  I saw the first one.
[02:37:37.534 --> 02:37:42.744]  Okay, well Force 10 from Navarone has got a Mr. Harrison Ford in it.
[02:37:43.616 --> 02:37:47.680]  And the analogy is, they bomb the Nazi dam to destroy the army below it.
[02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:49.861]  This is an analogy of an Info War.
[02:37:50.482 --> 02:37:56.127]  And when they bomb the dam, they expect it to fall right away, but the demolition guy goes, no, it'll take some time.
[02:37:56.147 --> 02:37:59.710]  You know, this thing, this New World Order won't be blown up instantly.
[02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:06.816]  It's all of us in the Info War firing and firing and firing and firing the truth at them, day after day, relentlessly.
[02:38:07.216 --> 02:38:08.637]  That is what will bring them down.
[02:38:09.138 --> 02:38:10.619]  And we're having victories, gentlemen.
[02:38:11.505 --> 02:38:13.206]  Yeah, you know, I believe that.
[02:38:13.627 --> 02:38:17.250]  We're all in this story together, and we all have parts to play.
[02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:30.960]  And the most important parts are Mr. Rodriguez continuing to talk, and for people continuing to listen, because if they listen to him, then all the other parts of the story will not be quite as confusing.
[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:34.263]  And that's what the government hopes to happen.
[02:38:34.383 --> 02:38:35.224]  Let me add to that.
[02:38:37.654 --> 02:38:41.615]  And this is for the radio audience out there.
[02:38:41.635 --> 02:38:45.736]  I have nothing whatsoever to gain with this.
[02:38:47.237 --> 02:38:52.338]  It's not even fame because I already was on practically all over the world with this news.
[02:38:52.618 --> 02:38:59.400]  And the funny thing is that people don't understand that the reason we're doing this, especially me, is a mission.
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:02.801]  I lost 200 friends that work at the building.
[02:39:03.301 --> 02:39:06.842]  And they have enough voice whatsoever to speak for them.
[02:39:07.495 --> 02:39:22.900]  So it's my responsibility as a survivor, and as a leader now, to make those questions available to everybody, not only to those commissions, but to everybody, so they could actually scrutinize and look into themselves and say, is this true?
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:23.880]  Is this what happened?
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:30.562]  Because going back to what you said before with that gentleman from the former administration of Reagan,
[02:39:31.641 --> 02:39:54.535]  What we need to have to actually investigate is an international commission of victims of terrorism that will be totally autonomous of any governmental influence to actually hire our own experts and to see our own evidence and come to our own conclusions and then let the government answer to the conclusions.
[02:39:55.174 --> 02:39:56.335]  That's the way to do it.
[02:39:56.555 --> 02:40:01.597]  And I tell you something, we cannot have a commission establishing in the United States.
[02:40:01.877 --> 02:40:04.118]  And that won't be the end all be all either.
[02:40:04.158 --> 02:40:05.559]  It's all part of a process.
[02:40:06.019 --> 02:40:09.081]  And we should look at who stands to gain from terrorism.
[02:40:09.121 --> 02:40:11.942]  And I'll say this, and I want both of you to comment on it briefly, then we're going to go back to calls.
[02:40:12.665 --> 02:40:13.566]  They're not going to stop.
[02:40:13.586 --> 02:40:15.948]  The globalists are going to carry out more terror attacks.
[02:40:15.968 --> 02:40:17.049]  They've said it's going to happen.
[02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:19.071]  They stand to gain from it.
[02:40:19.431 --> 02:40:25.897]  And so we're trying to save more lives by exposing who's behind this and bringing the real perpetrators to justice, Greg.
[02:40:26.438 --> 02:40:31.462]  Well, yeah, you know, the question always, the people that I talk to a lot, is when is the next shoe going to fall?
[02:40:31.542 --> 02:40:35.246]  And the next question becomes where, when, and why.
[02:40:35.306 --> 02:40:36.207]  And we know it's coming.
[02:40:36.827 --> 02:40:43.291]  And basically, I think it's time to at least let them know that the charade's up and we know what's going to happen.
[02:40:43.771 --> 02:40:46.413]  The question is, they stay one step ahead of us.
[02:40:46.853 --> 02:40:50.055]  And they have the resources, the power, the control.
[02:40:50.355 --> 02:40:59.100]  But if we discredit them and show people who has the motive, then they may not be able to carry out the attack because they'll test the waters and know that we're not going to buy it.
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.842]  Exactly, and that's why it's important that the critical mass is reached.
[02:41:03.202 --> 02:41:04.923]  Because once the critical mass is reached,
[02:41:05.884 --> 02:41:07.506]  I think so too.
[02:41:07.886 --> 02:41:08.607]  I think so too.
[02:41:08.687 --> 02:41:20.859]  And as this lady who's putting on this play in Hollywood says, it's the second wave now and she wants to be part of this second wave of people to listen now to the 9-11 story that a lot of us have been talking about.
[02:41:20.999 --> 02:41:28.982]  I mean, I look at it as a giant juggernaut, a tank coming towards us, and we're all just firing at it with a concerted effort.
[02:41:29.022 --> 02:41:31.903]  It's blaring on its loudspeaker, you can't stop me, I'm invincible.
[02:41:32.143 --> 02:41:37.344]  But the thing is smoking, there's fire coming out from underneath it, it's slowing down.
[02:41:38.925 --> 02:41:43.887]  Let's go to Don in Michigan, then we'll go to Annette and Michael and others.
[02:41:44.107 --> 02:41:45.187]  Don in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:41:48.348 --> 02:41:55.851]  I received notice a few days ago that up here in Jackson, Michigan on the south side of town there's a park called Sparks Foundation County Park.
[02:41:56.352 --> 02:42:02.815]  And inside that county park, inside of a glass cage, is a section of an outer beam from the World Trade Center.
[02:42:03.275 --> 02:42:05.516]  So I went up to take some pictures over the weekend.
[02:42:06.196 --> 02:42:10.440]  And what I found on this beam, like I say, it's inside of a glass cage.
[02:42:11.041 --> 02:42:18.347]  I did a search on this also and I found no other beams on display except for one that's at the George Bush Museum.
[02:42:18.707 --> 02:42:23.211]  And I took some pictures of this, and I'm going to send them out to you, but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this.
[02:42:23.632 --> 02:42:29.096]  It looks, it appears as if the edges, the ends of this beam were sheared off.
[02:42:29.517 --> 02:42:31.699]  There's no signs of heat.
[02:42:32.219 --> 02:42:41.963]  There's no signs of fire, there's still red paint on the beam, and it's identified as, there's a big old number 79 that they spray painted on the side of it.
[02:42:42.343 --> 02:42:52.988]  And I guess my question for... Well, I would think if they're going to release a beam, they'd sanitize it and make sure it didn't have anything incriminating, but they do make mistakes, most of it, all of it that I knew of was hauled off.
[02:42:53.128 --> 02:42:53.388]  Right, right.
[02:42:53.448 --> 02:42:55.989]  I didn't know about the beam up at College Station.
[02:42:56.329 --> 02:43:04.604]  Okay, I understand that, but... Can you go to PrisonPlanet.com, it says contact webmaster, email that to Paul and write us a brief description, we'll post it.
[02:43:05.234 --> 02:43:07.235]  Okay, and I will also send you some pictures.
[02:43:07.435 --> 02:43:15.040]  You would have had them by now, but I wanted to get a close-up of the... Well, why don't you... Sir, do you know how to... Is it a digital camera or film?
[02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:15.600]  No, it's not.
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:16.161]  No, it's not.
[02:43:16.301 --> 02:43:16.761]  It's 35mm.
[02:43:16.821 --> 02:43:18.862]  Do you know how to scan those?
[02:43:19.102 --> 02:43:20.123]  I don't have a scanner.
[02:43:20.143 --> 02:43:21.104]  I probably could.
[02:43:21.124 --> 02:43:22.484]  I bet your neighbor does.
[02:43:22.545 --> 02:43:23.665]  I bet you can scan them.
[02:43:23.785 --> 02:43:24.706]  I will try to do that.
[02:43:24.746 --> 02:43:27.568]  Well, just mail them and make sure it's got a note with it.
[02:43:27.968 --> 02:43:28.708]  Okay, excellent.
[02:43:29.829 --> 02:43:30.709]  Okay, let me get a copy.
[02:43:32.668 --> 02:43:34.069]  I'm sorry, what did you say, Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:43:34.530 --> 02:43:36.671]  Anything, anything, because we'll scan it for him.
[02:43:37.692 --> 02:43:38.533]  Okay, okay.
[02:43:38.853 --> 02:43:40.955]  Have you heard of any other beans on display?
[02:43:41.916 --> 02:43:42.136]  Sure.
[02:43:42.156 --> 02:43:42.716]  I haven't, no.
[02:43:42.756 --> 02:43:46.660]  There's, uh, there's, there's, uh, there's, uh, beans all over the nation.
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:53.465]  They send beans, uh, we have in New Jersey, we have in, uh, Pennsylvania, we have in, uh, California.
[02:43:53.485 --> 02:43:54.806]  And these are little pop-ups.
[02:43:55.026 --> 02:43:55.567]  Everywhere.
[02:43:55.587 --> 02:43:56.648]  Yes, exactly.
[02:43:56.788 --> 02:44:01.692]  And, and they say that it was, they believe it was from Tower Number 2 and was found over a block away.
[02:44:02.133 --> 02:44:03.433]  Forty feet underground.
[02:44:06.054 --> 02:44:08.354]  And I will tell you, don't even believe that.
[02:44:08.374 --> 02:44:09.334]  Hold on, one at a time.
[02:44:09.994 --> 02:44:10.675]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:44:10.775 --> 02:44:21.817]  I'm sorry, don't even believe that because once the building collapsed, the bees don't have a number, like this belongs to building number one, building number two.
[02:44:22.177 --> 02:44:25.037]  They're just, you know, giving information that is incorrect.
[02:44:25.057 --> 02:44:25.557]  Correct.
[02:44:25.577 --> 02:44:26.297]  Go ahead.
[02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:30.431]  Greg, comments?
[02:44:31.651 --> 02:44:34.153]  Not specifically on the beams, no.
[02:44:34.754 --> 02:44:41.538]  There's still concrete in the beam and like I say, the red paint is still there with a few scratches on it and that's it.
[02:44:42.219 --> 02:44:47.943]  It does refer to an explosion on the small temporary plaque that's inside the display.
[02:44:48.283 --> 02:44:51.245]  It explains the explosion of 9-1-1.
[02:44:51.885 --> 02:44:54.247]  It's not the collapse, it's the explosion.
[02:44:54.547 --> 02:44:57.169]  And I tried to take a close-up picture of the plaque
[02:44:57.489 --> 02:45:04.696]  And it turned out fuzzy, so I'm going to try to go back up and write it myself or try to get a better picture, but I will get that to you, Alex.
[02:45:04.836 --> 02:45:05.437]  Alright, thank you.
[02:45:05.777 --> 02:45:06.458]  Very nice of you.
[02:45:07.239 --> 02:45:11.222]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Annette.
[02:45:12.303 --> 02:45:13.665]  Annette, where are you calling us from today?
[02:45:14.349 --> 02:45:15.529]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:45:16.410 --> 02:45:17.970]  I have some additional information.
[02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:19.070]  Annette, where are you calling us from?
[02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:20.451]  Oh, West Virginia.
[02:45:20.471 --> 02:45:20.791]  Welcome.
[02:45:20.831 --> 02:45:21.471]  Thank you for calling.
[02:45:21.531 --> 02:45:21.931]  Go ahead.
[02:45:21.971 --> 02:45:22.611]  You're welcome.
[02:45:23.451 --> 02:45:29.993]  I have some additional information with reference to the Janet C. Whalen interview by the Power Hour this morning.
[02:45:30.333 --> 02:45:38.475]  She brought out that while they have been putting T-valves in the water system to monitor individual buildings,
[02:45:38.975 --> 02:45:54.205]  Now they have new ones, which they're replacing the old ones with computerized T-valves so that you can add individually to each building whatever you want to, besides water.
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:06.970]  So bringing total control in where they can, and we have official government plans that have been declassified of springs, cities with knockout gas, the government putting stuff in the water supply, so I guess that's what the caller was mentioning?
[02:46:07.210 --> 02:46:16.557]  Yes, and she gave her email as Janet C. Phalen, P-H-A-L-E-N, the number 10,
[02:46:17.854 --> 02:46:19.716]  I don't think so.
[02:46:34.947 --> 02:46:39.972]  In the public, the water department on the West Coast.
[02:46:40.732 --> 02:46:42.794]  I'm not sure of the particular area.
[02:46:43.115 --> 02:46:50.501]  Okay, so water, you know, I've just got to find out about this specifically instead of, it'll turn into rumors and then, you know.
[02:46:51.242 --> 02:46:53.324]  I'll just have to call David Joyce myself and ask him, okay?
[02:46:53.524 --> 02:46:54.184]  Yes, surely.
[02:46:54.285 --> 02:46:55.005]  Thank you for the call.
[02:46:56.226 --> 02:46:57.067]  Who's up next here?
[02:46:58.348 --> 02:46:59.669]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[02:46:59.709 --> 02:47:00.210]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:47:01.261 --> 02:47:01.601]  I think.
[02:47:01.801 --> 02:47:04.363]  Yeah, deductive reasoning tells you they blew these buildings up.
[02:47:04.903 --> 02:47:06.444]  Here's a question for Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:47:06.685 --> 02:47:15.830]  We're told that the security firm in charge of the World Trade Center complex, up and through September 10th, was headed up by Marvin Bush, President Bush's brother.
[02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:18.032]  His mother admits that.
[02:47:18.972 --> 02:47:20.373]  It's been in major newspapers.
[02:47:20.954 --> 02:47:28.759]  The story first surfaced when Mommy Bush, in her book, Reflections, in her autobiography, bragged about it, how brave he was.
[02:47:29.379 --> 02:47:30.540]  Tom, it's a gentleman, both of you.
[02:47:31.808 --> 02:47:32.328]  Go ahead, William.
[02:47:32.348 --> 02:47:33.269]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:47:34.229 --> 02:47:44.874]  Well, I heard so many stories about it, and again, you know, we could not continue checking every single angle because there's so many angles that we have here in New York.
[02:47:45.754 --> 02:47:47.815]  Several major newspapers didn't report it's true.
[02:47:48.959 --> 02:47:50.180]  Yeah, no, no, it's true.
[02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:51.000]  That's what we heard.
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:53.441]  But again, we have been bombarded.
[02:47:53.561 --> 02:48:02.985]  And now, just to remind the people, in New York, we're on the news practically almost every day, twice a week, minimum, because everything is 9-11 here.
[02:48:04.285 --> 02:48:16.089]  And, uh, we are floated with so much information... So when you're on the street talking to people, I mean, do most New Yorkers reflect the Zogby Poll, believing there's government involvement?
[02:48:16.149 --> 02:48:16.489]  Oh, yes.
[02:48:16.869 --> 02:48:17.269]  Oh, yes.
[02:48:17.489 --> 02:48:17.869]  Oh, yes.
[02:48:18.129 --> 02:48:20.830]  And the Zogby Poll was actually commissioned by Jimmy Walter.
[02:48:20.850 --> 02:48:24.191]  I mean, when you're talking to New Yorkers on the street, what do they say?
[02:48:25.512 --> 02:48:27.313]  They don't believe the official story.
[02:48:27.333 --> 02:48:40.080]  This is incredible that the majority of the people like, I mean, the common sense, they said common sense, is that, number one, the biggest nation in the world in terms of security.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:42.601]  Every single agency failed continuously.
[02:48:42.621 --> 02:48:43.341]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:43.361 --> 02:48:43.822]  Stay with us.
[02:48:43.842 --> 02:48:44.322]  We got them all right.
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:49.902]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.142 --> 02:48:51.724]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:49:06.315 --> 02:49:09.158]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.238 --> 02:49:13.922]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.122 --> 02:49:18.526]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[02:50:47.145 --> 02:50:49.566]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[02:50:49.806 --> 02:50:52.607]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[02:50:52.947 --> 02:50:56.969]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[02:50:57.209 --> 02:51:06.493]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[02:51:06.813 --> 02:51:11.738]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[02:51:11.998 --> 02:51:15.961]  Loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[02:51:16.082 --> 02:51:23.108]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and sleep.
[02:51:23.168 --> 02:51:23.969]  So much more.
[02:51:24.189 --> 02:51:30.233]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[02:51:50.501 --> 02:51:52.382]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.883 --> 02:51:55.685]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.266 --> 02:52:02.950]  This broadcast will retransmit tonight 9 to midnight central standard time on your local A&M dial.
[02:52:03.471 --> 02:52:06.593]  Global shortwave at 3210 at night during the day at 9.985.
[02:52:06.673 --> 02:52:09.755]  Third hour 9.975 I believe.
[02:52:10.556 --> 02:52:13.959]  And on the internet at infowares.com and prisonpanda.com.
[02:52:13.979 --> 02:52:16.961]  Before we go back to our guests, we'll take a few final calls.
[02:52:18.664 --> 02:52:23.068]  For Greg Ziminski and of course one of the heroes of 9-11, William Rodriguez.
[02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:26.151]  I believe it's already sold out.
[02:52:26.191 --> 02:52:29.094]  The showings tonight for Marshall Law in South Lamar.
[02:52:29.114 --> 02:52:33.037]  And I did just get word, because I'd asked for that earlier.
[02:52:33.077 --> 02:52:33.418]  Thank you.
[02:52:33.578 --> 02:52:34.719]  I'd forgotten to ask about it.
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:36.701]  Yes, it sold out.
[02:52:36.741 --> 02:52:37.762]  Did they say when it sold out?
[02:52:39.563 --> 02:52:40.965]  Probably sold out yesterday.
[02:52:41.385 --> 02:52:43.107]  I knew it was close to selling out yesterday.
[02:52:43.715 --> 02:52:49.642]  But usually 5-10 people don't show up who buy tickets online, and you can usually get in.
[02:52:50.142 --> 02:52:56.349]  You show up right when it's starting, and they tend to, it's really a bigger, it's like a 230 theater, but they only sell like 215.
[02:52:56.389 --> 02:53:01.435]  They usually hold back a few, so if you live in the area, I don't want you to waste your time if you don't live in the area.
[02:53:01.895 --> 02:53:04.257]  You're probably driving and maybe still get in.
[02:53:04.277 --> 02:53:05.558]  I hate to have you stand in line.
[02:53:05.958 --> 02:53:09.501]  But 8 o'clock tonight, last showing, at least for a while, of Martial Law.
[02:53:09.521 --> 02:53:10.862]  I want to thank all the folks that are coming.
[02:53:10.882 --> 02:53:15.766]  If you want a hard copy of Martial Law to find out what really happened on 9-11, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:53:16.266 --> 02:53:17.127]  Order a hard copy.
[02:53:17.167 --> 02:53:18.348]  This is the bombshell film.
[02:53:18.388 --> 02:53:19.349]  This is the documentary.
[02:53:19.909 --> 02:53:21.631]  I mean, you know, it's not hype, folks.
[02:53:21.651 --> 02:53:22.952]  You've heard the reviews by others.
[02:53:23.512 --> 02:53:24.653]  I mean, it is powerful.
[02:53:24.673 --> 02:53:25.654]  A toll-free number to get it.
[02:53:26.974 --> 02:53:29.295]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:31.055 --> 02:53:37.757]  Call, order it, start making copies, start exposing the globalists that carried out 9-11.
[02:53:37.777 --> 02:53:38.177]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:38.597 --> 02:53:49.380]  Or order a hard copy via Infowars.com or get a 15 cent a day monthly or yearly subscription at PrisonPlanet.tv and watch them all online.
[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:53.421]  All my films, books, a bunch of other films, my weekly TV show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:54.785 --> 02:54:01.910]  Because we're going to run out of time, but first I want to thank William Rodriguez, survivor of 9-11, hero of 9-11, who heard the bombs going off.
[02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:05.713]  I want to thank Greg Zemensky for his tireless effort to expose this.
[02:54:06.073 --> 02:54:07.314]  Let's take a few final calls.
[02:54:07.634 --> 02:54:10.536]  Mike in New York, you've got 30 seconds to finish up, then I'm going to Brian.
[02:54:10.876 --> 02:54:21.644]  The reason why I asked is because I'm wondering if Mr. Rodriguez has any information or if he knows if anybody has information about an increased activity by that security firm or even private contractors coming in to do wiring.
[02:54:21.664 --> 02:54:22.364]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:22.404 --> 02:54:30.730]  Yeah, the question is, we heard reports of different floors being shut down for construction and maintenance and drills evacuating the building three times a month before 9-11.
[02:54:30.750 --> 02:54:31.471]  Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:54:32.111 --> 02:54:32.332]  True.
[02:54:33.692 --> 02:54:34.353]  You said true.
[02:54:34.373 --> 02:54:35.614]  Give us details, please.
[02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:42.641]  Well, actually, the building only have drills twice a year, which is stupid.
[02:54:42.681 --> 02:54:47.563]  A building that high should have been having drills maybe once a month.
[02:54:49.463 --> 02:54:54.665]  There was an increase of security and then a decrease of security.
[02:54:55.825 --> 02:55:01.487]  They were having shutdown, electrical shutdown in the building prior to 9-11, supposedly to test
[02:55:04.301 --> 02:55:06.362]  And I did shut down some of the floors, too?
[02:55:06.382 --> 02:55:06.902]  Ah, very convenient.
[02:55:06.922 --> 02:55:09.603]  Let's go ahead and make a final call.
[02:55:09.844 --> 02:55:10.804]  Brian, Indiana, quickly.
[02:55:10.884 --> 02:55:11.484]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:55:30.723 --> 02:55:38.992]  Yeah, I know Alex, before you talked about that firefighters were told not to talk in fear of their families and stuff like that.
[02:55:39.012 --> 02:55:43.176]  I wonder if Mr. Rodriguez had to contact any of these people post 9-11.
[02:55:43.236 --> 02:55:47.601]  Have you been told by folks that were told, well he didn't say he was told to shut up, but was anybody threatened?
[02:55:48.943 --> 02:55:50.684]  Well, it's not threatened directly.
[02:55:50.764 --> 02:55:52.665]  They do it in a subtle way.
[02:55:52.965 --> 02:56:01.608]  And it's basically that they tell you not to get into those issues because you're going to get problems with the CIA, the FBI, or everybody involved.
[02:56:01.708 --> 02:56:02.369]  Well, that is a threat.
[02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:03.269]  So you better keep quiet.
[02:56:03.509 --> 02:56:04.369]  All right.
[02:56:04.689 --> 02:56:05.730]  Mr. Robert, go ahead.
[02:56:07.701 --> 02:56:16.425]  I want to say thank you for having me on the show, and thank you for Greg who invited me to actually meet you, and you can count on me on any event.
[02:56:16.625 --> 02:56:17.425]  Well, God bless you.
[02:56:17.505 --> 02:56:18.406]  I'll be available.
[02:56:18.506 --> 02:56:20.267]  Listen, Greg, thanks for coming on, too.
[02:56:20.287 --> 02:56:21.187]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:56:21.287 --> 02:56:21.987]  I really enjoy it.
[02:56:22.288 --> 02:56:23.188]  Take care, my friend.
[02:56:23.448 --> 02:56:25.029]  God bless.
[02:56:26.089 --> 02:56:30.411]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:36.561]  Nope.
