[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:10.855]  ...an amazing individual on, he's Jude Winensky, and, uh, again, advisor to Ronald Reagan, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, uh, political economist...
[00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:28.366]  And a lot of conservatives, you know, we've had generals, we've had admirals, we've had the former Judge Advocate General of the Navy on about how torture's wrong and the neocons are out of control and they're getting our troops killed and the army told them 400,000 troops or it's going to be a Vietnam.
[00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:34.169]  And this staged election and these obvious puppet installments aren't fooling anybody.
[00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:37.790]  Maybe they're fooling some people, but it's not fooling those who are really looking at it.
[00:00:40.194 --> 00:00:43.038]  The media focuses in on people like Gorbachev.
[00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:44.800]  Oh, look at that communist liberal.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.663]  He says it's fake, so it must not be fake.
[00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:54.107]  Again, but the media doesn't focus in on people like Jude Wineski and others that are criticizing a lot of this.
[00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:56.108]  Mr. Wineski, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:00:56.108 --> 00:00:56.729]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.030]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.490]  You bet.
[00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.793]  Anything for people that don't know who you are that I didn't cover?
[00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:08.577]  Well, you mentioned before we went on, I wrote a book called The Way the World Works.
[00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:12.881]  And it's really the foundation of the Reaganomics and supply-side economics.
[00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:16.043]  And I developed all that when I was at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:25.713]  And I was very proud in the year 2000, the editors of the National Review named it one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century, the way the world works.
[00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:32.495]  Of course, I have to point out that I came in 94th, somewhat behind the joy of cooking.
[00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.116]  Well, now, and your website is Womyninski.com.
[00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:44.038]  Womyninski.com, and I have a daily commentary, and I've been writing about Iraq a lot lately, and you can register, and it's all for free.
[00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:50.562]  Okay, let's start here with... You talk about your friends, the neocons.
[00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:52.344]  I mean, you know these guys intimately.
[00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.625]  Who are they?
[00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:56.387]  Why are you opposing some of their policies?
[00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:01.411]  Well, Richard Perle is kind of the ringleader of the neocons.
[00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:06.595]  A neocon simply means that you used to be a liberal and now you're a conservative.
[00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:08.116]  You're a new conservative.
[00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:12.059]  And I was a liberal Democrat for most of my life.
[00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.639]  I'm 68 years old now.
[00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:43.440]  I met Pearl back in 1969 when he was 25 years old and working for Scoop Jackson, the senator from the state of Washington, and George Will, who we all know is now on ABC, and the late Bob Bartley, who was the editor of the Wall Street Journal, and we were all Cold Warriors, and we were united in a very hard line against communism,
[00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:48.731]  in Moscow and in Beijing, and fought the Cold War together.
[00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:57.417]  And we were proud at being successful in fighting that Cold War without having a nuclear exchange.
[00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:09.706]  But when the Cold War ended, in roughly early 1990s, when the Soviets decided that they had enough of communism, the Russians invited me to Moscow
[00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:16.759]  To try and help them turn their communist system into a market economy.
[00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.560]  And I was glad to do that for free.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.661]  And I made several trips pro bono.
[00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:27.944]  Because I've never taken any money from a politician or a government in all my years at Polyconomics.
[00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:34.166]  But I broke, I had to break with my old friends because they said, we didn't beat these guys enough.
[00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:35.787]  We have to smash them into the ground.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.583]  And we want to feed them bad economic advice, shock therapy, so that they will fall apart.
[00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:47.605]  And I said, well, you know, as far as I'm concerned, when they come out with their hands up and they say we give up.
[00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:54.543]  And we're prepared to be capitalists, and we're prepared to be baptized into the church.
[00:03:54.543 --> 00:03:56.424]  That's enough for me, but it wasn't enough.
[00:03:56.424 --> 00:04:04.531]  But the truth is, they wanted those few oligarchs in so that big global corporations could work with them a little bit easier.
[00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:09.956]  Well, you see, warriors have to be able to fight wars, and otherwise they're useless.
[00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:14.140]  So this is really what's behind Eisenhower's warning about the military-industrial complex.
[00:04:14.597 --> 00:04:16.578]  And that's what the neocons are.
[00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:20.360]  I mean, Dick Cheney, I've known Dick Cheney since he was in his early 30s.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.163]  I've known Don Rumsfeld when he was a congressman from Illinois.
[00:04:25.163 --> 00:04:31.687]  These are all people I... Paul Wolfowitz, who's a deputy at the Pentagon.
[00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:34.028]  They're all people I've known all these years.
[00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:36.049]  Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard.
[00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:38.302]  I mean, we were buddies.
[00:04:38.302 --> 00:04:39.523]  We partied together.
[00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:53.551]  Well, I want to go over this, though, because the Washington Post, CNN, big papers in Canada, one headline, what, in the National Mail, the ghost of Trotsky walks the halls of the White House.
[00:04:53.551 --> 00:05:02.957]  You say they're these anti-communists, but didn't the neocons become, you know, founded by Crystal's daddy, you know, out-quote of the failure of the Trotskyites?
[00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:04.898]  Well, yeah, this is Irving Kristol.
[00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:06.819]  He was my mentor.
[00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.800]  I mean, I called him.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.962]  I coined the phrase Don Corleone.
[00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:13.163]  Irving Kristol, he's still kicking.
[00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:16.725]  He's now in his well into his 80s.
[00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:25.431]  And I think Irving himself, Bill Kristol's dad, he's not a neocon in the sense that he really supported all this war.
[00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:27.572]  He was probably
[00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:30.878]  Standing back and saying, look, I'm too old to be involved.
[00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:36.359]  So when did he supposedly switch out of the Fourth International to being this conservative?
[00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:49.443]  Well, this happened after, at the time, at the time of Alger Hiss and Whitaker Chambers, when you had all kinds of people in the late 1940s who had been thinking in terms of
[00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:55.858]  Some form of communism is being acceptable.
[00:05:55.858 --> 00:06:04.604]  Trotskyism being what they kicked around when they were at CCNY, the old City College in New York.
[00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:06.305]  This is how they came together.
[00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:20.414]  And it was in the late 40s that they began to worry that this is not the way they wanted things to develop in the USSR and gradually shifted out of
[00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.264]  uh... communism and socialism and then moved into capitalism.
[00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:37.052]  I remember there was a time when uh... when uh... Irving Kristol uh... you know came over, came as far as to say write a book called Two Cheers for Capitalism and then became a complete capitalist.
[00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:39.313]  Yeah, Two Cheers passage.
[00:06:39.313 --> 00:06:41.955]  I went with him for a good part of that.
[00:06:41.955 --> 00:06:45.698]  Two Cheers for crony capitalism, command and control.
[00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:47.419]  See, I go way past all these
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.782]  Well, there is certainly a lot of corporate capitalism out there.
[00:06:50.782 --> 00:06:52.203]  Have you read this new book about
[00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:16.505]  The Confessions of Economic Hitman?
[00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:17.506]  Yes, we've had him on.
[00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:18.246]  You've had him on.
[00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:20.308]  Yeah, well he's in the ballpark.
[00:07:20.308 --> 00:07:27.933]  There's a lot of stuff in the book that I don't quite agree with, but there is big money in the United States.
[00:07:27.933 --> 00:07:37.620]  There is an establishment on Wall Street, and they find it in their interest to have crises around the world that they can
[00:07:38.516 --> 00:07:45.021]  That they can deal with through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and make money in the process.
[00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.984]  We're talking to Jude Wanninski of Wanninski.com.
[00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:52.067]  W-A-N-N-I-S-K-I.com or just go to Infowars.com.
[00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:54.449]  You can link directly through to his website.
[00:07:54.449 --> 00:08:05.758]  He was associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, a political economist, advisor to Ronald Reagan, one of the architects of supply-side economics, a real icon in that movement.
[00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.019]  And look,
[00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:18.242]  Shifting gears here, we have the neocons who, with the PNAC documents, want to invade 63 countries.
[00:08:18.242 --> 00:08:19.644]  They've invaded two of them.
[00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:22.046]  They're already beginning to attack Syria with these
[00:08:22.933 --> 00:08:24.374]  I would agree with that.
[00:08:51.576 --> 00:08:54.638]  Okay, well then what are they up to and what are we facing?
[00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:59.200]  Well, I think they, uh, Pat Buchanan is a good friend of mine.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.161]  I talk to him all the time.
[00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:02.682]  I've known him from the early Nixon years.
[00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:13.249]  Uh, you know, he said they've passed their peak, the neocons, and that they've gotten so bloodied in this, uh, in Iraq that they're losing power.
[00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:20.753]  And one of the signs, the sure sign, that they're losing influence is the departure of the number three man at the Pentagon, Douglas Fyfe.
[00:09:21.768 --> 00:09:23.950]  Uh, who's just resigned.
[00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:40.500]  And, uh, at the State Department, although I've written that I think Condoleezza Rice is really incompetent to be Secretary of State, she's competent to do a lot of things because she's very bright, but she has shown no skills in the diplomatic world.
[00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:45.355]  But she has brought in with her as her deputy, Robert Zoellick, who is the U.S.
[00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:54.838]  Trade Representative, and a man I much admire for his diplomatic skills, and that I think... Let me digress for just a second.
[00:09:54.838 --> 00:10:04.021]  The combination of these factors make me a little bit more hopeful that the Bush administration is going to be pointed in a less aggressive direction.
[00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.742]  Let me digress for a second.
[00:10:05.742 --> 00:10:07.723]  Why have we seen such an exodus?
[00:10:07.723 --> 00:10:08.363]  You know, I thought
[00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:15.207]  That it was just people going to cash in on the private sector while they've still got power for four years with their connections.
[00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:18.288]  But then Carl Rove told U.S.
[00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:25.812]  News & World Report that no, they weren't energetic enough, were kicking all these people out, plus they were lightning rods and putting in a new batch.
[00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:27.973]  What do you think the truth is?
[00:10:27.973 --> 00:10:36.358]  Well, a lot of the people that are leaving are exhausted and they wound up having to
[00:10:37.349 --> 00:10:38.470]  I think so.
[00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.911]  Yeah, but you say they may be lessening.
[00:10:53.911 --> 00:11:07.535]  I mean, his speech at his coronation last week, or a week and a half ago, when he was on the 20th, I mean, Bush was up there literally talking about a crusade against evil.
[00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:18.839]  I know, but he's been backtracking ever since because of the way, you know, President Bush was chosen by the neocons when he was governor of Texas.
[00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:21.020]  In fact, they picked him
[00:11:21.553 --> 00:11:26.917]  To be the candidate, in fact, that the neocons picked, George W. Bush.
[00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:29.538]  Wasn't it George Shultz that vetted him?
[00:11:29.538 --> 00:11:45.249]  Well, George Shultz, he's part of the gang, and George Shultz is the one who introduced Condoleezza Rice into the National Security Council in the first Bush administration, to Brent Scowcroft, and then brought her back when President Bush
[00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:54.261]  And when Governor Bush, they said, hey, look, we want you to run for president, and he essentially told them that he didn't know anything about foreign policy.
[00:11:54.261 --> 00:12:00.562]  He really knew, you know, how to manage the Texas Rangers baseball team, but that's as far as it went.
[00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:04.863]  And they said, well, we're going to fix you up with the smartest people around.
[00:12:04.863 --> 00:12:09.524]  And what they did was they sent him Condoleezza Rice, and she came down to Crawford.
[00:12:10.243 --> 00:12:25.515]  And she was there for a week or so, and then she said, Mr. President, you should meet a man I think who's very bright, and she brought Paul Wolfowitz down to Crawford, and their pictures were in the paper, and then a week later, here's a picture of Richard Perle!
[00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:27.116]  And then George Shultz!
[00:12:27.116 --> 00:12:38.404]  George Shultz was in there, he's a member of the Defense Policy Board, sits right next to Richard Perle, in planning all these maneuvers, and of course, Don Rumsfeld,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:51.922]  Don Rumsfeld introduced Rumsfeld to the neocons back when he was in the Ford administration and he's never been his own man.
[00:12:51.922 --> 00:12:52.624]  In other words,
[00:12:53.203 --> 00:13:02.550]  It's been Pearl and Wolfowitz who have been doing the strategic thinking behind the Pentagon, and Rumsfeld has been one of their agents.
[00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:12.238]  So is it a real split when Brent Scowcroft and George Herbert Walker kind of send out signals about not being too keen on the war before the war?
[00:13:12.238 --> 00:13:13.919]  Oh, absolutely it was.
[00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:21.905]  I was thinking in the last days before we went to war that because of the positions that were being taken
[00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:23.046]  I don't know.
[00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:41.293]  Essentially saying to us, and to the Security Council, look, you can come anywhere you want, and as long as you want, and look under my bed, and you're not going to find any weapons of mass destruction.
[00:13:41.293 --> 00:13:43.315]  It was Bill Clinton who pulled the inspectors out.
[00:13:43.315 --> 00:13:45.136]  They never kicked him out.
[00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:47.718]  And then notice we heard it was all weapons of mass destruction.
[00:13:47.718 --> 00:13:49.939]  Now the war was never about that.
[00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:51.521]  Rumsfeld says that's an urban legend.
[00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:53.642]  He never said it on Face the Nation.
[00:13:53.642 --> 00:13:56.364]  No, it was about bringing democracy.
[00:13:57.173 --> 00:14:01.254]  Well, you know, they've run out of all the other excuses, so now they're down to democracy.
[00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:10.897]  And, of course, the elections that we had, everybody has tears in their eyes about how wonderful it is that all these people stood in line and braved the insurgents.
[00:14:10.897 --> 00:14:13.118]  But, you know, nothing really has changed.
[00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:18.840]  The insurgents don't really care about the turnout, whether it's a big one or a small one.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.860]  They're there.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:26.322]  The insurgency is directed at the United States, which has, as far as they're concerned, over the last
[00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:35.607]  Fifteen years, you know, killed a million and a half Iraqis with the sanctions and with the war, and they want us out of there.
[00:14:35.607 --> 00:14:42.490]  And they're not going to stand for any kind of government that has been shaped and managed by people like Hillary.
[00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:48.932]  By the way, that's roughly one out of twenty Iraqis is dead.
[00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:49.833]  Amazing.
[00:14:49.833 --> 00:14:51.994]  Jude Winensky, please stay with us, sir.
[00:14:51.994 --> 00:14:53.434]  I've got a bunch of other questions for you.
[00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:55.355]  I want to talk about what you think is going to happen in Iraq.
[00:14:56.215 --> 00:15:00.458]  Where do you think this is all going in the next year, the next two years, the next five years?
[00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:03.020]  What's your projection for the future?
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.123]  And we'll also take calls on Alex Jones.
[00:15:06.123 --> 00:15:07.304]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:15:07.304 --> 00:15:07.684]  Check it out.
[00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:16.474]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:15:16.474 --> 00:15:18.035]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:20.398]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:22.780]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:28.046]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:15:28.046 --> 00:15:32.090]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.112]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:15:34.112 --> 00:15:44.960]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.062]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.620]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.861]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:17.822]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:24.723]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:16:24.723 --> 00:16:27.924]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:30.444]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:16:30.444 --> 00:16:38.346]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:16:38.666 --> 00:16:50.069]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:56.371]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:56.671]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:43.637]  I always seem to have more interesting conversations with our guests during the breaks when I'm talking to them, but I was talking to Jude Winensky, who of course is a world-renowned political economist and former associate editor for the Wall Street Journal, also a top economic advisor and economic architect for Ronald Reagan during his first term of his presidency, and advising during the campaign as well.
[00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:50.441]  Mr. Winensky, continuing, during the break we were talking about what the neocons want, this world empire.
[00:18:50.441 --> 00:18:54.022]  But here, domestically, they're butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:54.022 --> 00:18:57.764]  Alberto Gonzales is claiming that President Bush is above the law.
[00:18:57.764 --> 00:19:02.166]  They are dismantling the Constitution wholesale.
[00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:04.106]  So they promise to spread freedom worldwide.
[00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:07.288]  Well, how about spreading some here at home?
[00:19:07.288 --> 00:19:12.410]  Well, we have an objective as large as the one that they have, and they believe that
[00:19:13.464 --> 00:19:16.405]  That right is on their side, and this is the way to go.
[00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:24.967]  You have to make it, you can't, as, what do they say, Lennon said, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
[00:19:24.967 --> 00:19:27.588]  So, whatever you have to do, you do!
[00:19:27.588 --> 00:19:39.352]  And you make excuses for it, and if you have to trample on the Constitution, or turn it inside out in order to approve the use of torture, the breaking of international conventions, you find ways to do that too!
[00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.363]  Mr. Wineski, you seem like they're getting delusional.
[00:19:43.363 --> 00:19:49.987]  I saw a quote in the New York Times by a top White House official saying, hey, you guys go ahead and write about our contradictions.
[00:19:49.987 --> 00:19:51.288]  We are the empire.
[00:19:51.288 --> 00:19:55.150]  We actually set reality and we'll change reality day to day.
[00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.232]  I mean, it's getting Twilight Zone.
[00:19:57.232 --> 00:19:58.473]  Well, it is.
[00:19:58.473 --> 00:20:00.994]  And people say, are you saying there's a conspiracy?
[00:20:00.994 --> 00:20:02.615]  And I said, of course, there's a conspiracy.
[00:20:02.615 --> 00:20:04.136]  And they advertise it.
[00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:05.377]  It's a public conspiracy.
[00:20:05.377 --> 00:20:07.239]  They're saying, here's what we're going to do.
[00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.220]  And we're going to do it for the good of the world.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.901]  Now, let me backtrack a little bit.
[00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:24.676]  And remember, we were talking in the earlier segment about how I was one of these folks, and that when the Cold War ended, one of the arguments that I was making is that, yes, we are an empire.
[00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:30.403]  We are now at the top of the whole political pyramid, of the power pyramid of the planet Earth.
[00:20:30.748 --> 00:20:32.209]  There's nobody else.
[00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:35.810]  So we have a responsibility to manage the world.
[00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.431]  Managing, not policing it.
[00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:51.096]  And the management of it means that we have to consult with all the members of the family of nations, with all of the people in NATO and at the UN Security Council before we go to war with anyone.
[00:20:51.096 --> 00:20:56.638]  And I was opposed with my argument that in terms of
[00:20:57.597 --> 00:21:06.422]  This time, when you're at peace, you put diplomacy first, because it's less expensive, and you don't really want to have wars all the time.
[00:21:06.422 --> 00:21:08.643]  And their argument was exactly the opposite.
[00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.825]  They say, we have to have an American empire, but we're going to kick ass.
[00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:15.280]  I want to be clear, though.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.123]  We, the American people, aren't part of this empire.
[00:21:18.123 --> 00:21:21.505]  There's this supposed reflected glory of people going, Yeah!
[00:21:21.505 --> 00:21:22.706]  We are an empire now!
[00:21:22.706 --> 00:21:23.527]  I'm powerful!
[00:21:23.527 --> 00:21:23.987]  No!
[00:21:23.987 --> 00:21:27.030]  In this empire, we're going to be slaves!
[00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.631]  Well, that's true.
[00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:34.636]  And the problem we had in the last election is that I broke with the Republican Party.
[00:21:34.636 --> 00:21:38.479]  I'd been a Republican voter going back to Nixon in 1968.
[00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:46.188]  And I voted for John Kerry, not holding my nose because he was a very good candidate, but I had to...
[00:21:46.724 --> 00:21:56.671]  But cast a vote against these warriors, because I don't like where they're taking us, and this is why Bush only won by a small amount of votes.
[00:21:56.671 --> 00:21:58.472]  But, I mean, you're a smart guy.
[00:21:58.472 --> 00:22:00.814]  You know, Kerry was like, we need to increase the troops.
[00:22:00.814 --> 00:22:02.035]  We need to... Iran!
[00:22:02.035 --> 00:22:02.975]  Iran's evil!
[00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:04.156]  Let's get them!
[00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:07.338]  And I thought I was listening to George Bush on steroids.
[00:22:07.338 --> 00:22:09.400]  He's terrible.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.082]  But what are we going to do for the next four years?
[00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.224]  And all I can say is that from
[00:22:15.749 --> 00:22:29.414]  One day to the next, I'm doing everything I can to encourage those forces inside the Bush Administration and inside the Republican Party to move in more moderate directions.
[00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:36.196]  And I'm believing that that will happen, that we're not going to have, they're not going to go into Iran.
[00:22:36.932 --> 00:22:39.192]  There's a lot of bluster about it.
[00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:47.114]  Uh, you know, Cy Hirsch did the whole world a favor by his article in the New Yorker, where he pointed out all the plans that we have.
[00:22:47.114 --> 00:22:57.496]  Well, I'll tell you what, we got a break, we're gonna start the second hour, I wanna... Big Brother.
[00:22:57.496 --> 00:22:59.256]  Mainstream media.
[00:22:59.256 --> 00:23:01.016]  Government cover-ups.
[00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:02.597]  You want answers?
[00:23:02.597 --> 00:23:03.357]  Well, so does he.
[00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:08.351]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:15.635]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:19.977]  Alright, we have one of the chief architects of supply-side economics on.
[00:23:19.977 --> 00:23:26.521]  Top political economic advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:29.023]  Also, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:23:30.752 --> 00:23:35.795]  And of course, friends with almost all the top neocons have done all of them.
[00:23:35.795 --> 00:23:41.397]  Jude Winensky, winensky.com is his economic forecast report and information.
[00:23:41.397 --> 00:23:43.238]  And we have a link to it, infowars.com.
[00:23:43.238 --> 00:23:53.463]  I know we have Jeff and Chelsea and Roger and Laverne and many others that are patiently holding your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:23:53.463 --> 00:23:58.606]  I know some stations actually carry the news, so I want to, in the next segment, get into his forecast of what's going to happen in Iraq.
[00:23:59.644 --> 00:24:06.148]  But, do you want to go to some calls here in just a second, sir, but what are some of the other things you want to talk about in the next 30 minutes?
[00:24:06.148 --> 00:24:08.269]  Just kind of a teaser.
[00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.850]  It's up to you.
[00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.710]  You're doing fine.
[00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.113]  I just want to ask you, please call me Jude instead of Mr. Wineski.
[00:24:14.113 --> 00:24:17.095]  I was named after St.
[00:24:17.095 --> 00:24:27.241]  Jude, the patron saint of hopeless cases, so I'm a little bit more optimistic than most people on all crises that I see facing the country.
[00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:33.029]  Well, I think we're going to have more terror attacks, and I think we're going to have a national draft, and I think we're going to go to war with the other countries.
[00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:34.169]  But you don't think that's going to happen?
[00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:34.790]  No, I don't.
[00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.831]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:24:35.831 --> 00:24:45.237]  I think that's... There's a recalculation by the Republican Party and by the President and by Karl Rove and...
[00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:50.136]  We can see this in some of the personnel changes that have been made.
[00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:53.697]  So you think they've taken off too big of a bite with Iraq already?
[00:24:53.697 --> 00:24:54.378]  That's right.
[00:24:54.378 --> 00:25:06.964]  And one of the big things that we've seen is that Mohammed al-Baradei is the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is an arm of the United Nations.
[00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:16.188]  And Baradei, the Bush neocons, has spent the last year planning to get rid of him and doing everything they can
[00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.310]  To prevent him from getting a third term.
[00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:25.552]  They don't like him because he's the guy who said, before we went to war, that we're not going to find any nuclear weapons here.
[00:25:25.552 --> 00:25:26.552]  They have no weapons.
[00:25:26.552 --> 00:25:28.312]  They have no weapons program.
[00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:29.772]  So they hate him for that.
[00:25:29.772 --> 00:25:33.233]  And they don't want him around because he's getting in their way.
[00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:42.855]  And we now see that we can't get any other of the 35 countries that vote on the matter to support us.
[00:25:42.855 --> 00:25:44.655]  All of the others are supporting Baradai.
[00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:47.178]  And we're going to have to go along with it.
[00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:54.820]  So a lot of what's... Well, even weapons inspectors that were neocons and said, we're going to fine them, said they were wrong.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:26:02.023]  And we know that Iraq is, I mean, basically, as modern military goes, was in the Stone Age after the bombardments of 91.
[00:26:02.023 --> 00:26:02.743]  Well, exactly.
[00:26:02.743 --> 00:26:03.263]  That's right.
[00:26:03.263 --> 00:26:05.904]  And we could tell
[00:26:06.718 --> 00:26:12.081]  I had, uh, Scott Ritter was the Chief U.N.
[00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:14.963]  Weapons Inspector for the UNSCOM Inspectors.
[00:26:14.963 --> 00:26:28.731]  And Ritter, although at the end of his term said there were still some remaining problems, essentially had written books saying that Iraq was disarmed, effectively disarmed, and wasn't a threat to anyone.
[00:26:29.156 --> 00:26:38.656]  And we knew that they couldn't reconstitute any of the weapons programs they had in the 80s, or we would have been able to tell from satellites that they were...
[00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:52.416]  I mean, it's also hypocritical when you've got Pakistan running around handing nuclear weapons components out like lollipops, and we've got North Korea, we've got Rumsfeld on the board of ABB transferring reactors.
[00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:54.458]  I mean, it's totally hypocritical.
[00:26:54.458 --> 00:27:10.008]  We've got China threatening... I'm going to recommend that you get on your program Dr. Gordon Prather, who was the chief scientist for the Army in the Reagan years, and he's a man my age, and he lives in New Mexico, and he was a nuclear weapons designer.
[00:27:10.592 --> 00:27:17.558]  And I've used him over the last 30 some years when any question comes up about a nuclear threat.
[00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:22.243]  Because he worked at Los Alamos.
[00:27:22.243 --> 00:27:26.085]  He was a nuclear weapons designer, a nuclear physicist.
[00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:34.669]  And he assures me that there is no way in the world that Iran, right now, Iran, could possibly have a nuclear weapon.
[00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:40.652]  Well, they're saying that even if they did a crash course for four years, it'd take four years.
[00:27:40.652 --> 00:27:44.914]  Things would take at least four years, and they'd only be able to do that
[00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:48.881]  If they dropped out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty... Gotta break!
[00:27:48.881 --> 00:27:49.322]  Gotta break!
[00:27:49.322 --> 00:27:49.903]  We'll be right back!
[00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:53.881]  Are you struggling with the hair loss problem?

[00:28:43.047 --> 00:28:44.128]  And who stands to gain?
[00:28:55.666 --> 00:28:57.167]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:28:57.167 --> 00:29:03.171]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:29:03.171 --> 00:29:08.735]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:29:08.735 --> 00:29:12.838]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:17.082]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:29:17.082 --> 00:29:21.826]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:28.112]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:29:28.112 --> 00:29:29.954]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.212]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:53.010]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.252]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:29:57.252 --> 00:30:00.213]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:30:00.213 --> 00:30:07.116]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:30:07.116 --> 00:30:10.318]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:30:10.318 --> 00:30:12.839]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:17.561]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:30:17.881 --> 00:30:18.241]  I think so.
[00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:44.337]  Alright, we're 8 minutes and 15 seconds into the second segment of this
[00:31:09.165 --> 00:31:10.885]  Second hour, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:10.885 --> 00:31:12.986]  It is the first day of February 2005.
[00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:29.890]  We're talking to a former associate editor at the Wall Street Journal, one of the architects, a world-renowned political economist, one of the architects of supply-side economics, and a former, of course, Reagan economic advisor, Jude Winensky.
[00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:35.691]  The website, winensky.com, W-A-N-N-I-S-K-I dot com, or link through at infowars.com.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:45.087]  And we're going to go to Jeff, Chelsea, Roger, Paul, and many others, and then get into his forecast of what is going to happen in Iraq.
[00:31:45.087 --> 00:31:54.696]  And again, he is friends with all the neocons, but opposed to them, and opposed to the war for global empire, and opposed to the police state being set up in America.
[00:31:54.696 --> 00:31:57.459]  We talked about that in the last hour, so I'm just recapping.
[00:31:59.278 --> 00:32:00.198]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:32:00.198 --> 00:32:01.699]  Where are you calling us from today?
[00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:03.939]  I'm calling from Louisiana, Alex.
[00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:04.239]  Welcome.
[00:32:04.239 --> 00:32:06.279]  You're on the air with Mr. Winensky.
[00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:06.640]  Right.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.721]  I'm going to give you two brief comments and then criticize Mr. Walensky on something.
[00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:21.743]  First of all, last night American experienced the... In 1979, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, they told Castro, if you criticize the invasion, we will permit the U.S.
[00:32:21.743 --> 00:32:23.123]  to attack Cuba.
[00:32:23.123 --> 00:32:28.444]  Second, 10-20 on WWL, they talked about the thumb scanning in Portland, Oregon supermarkets.
[00:32:29.068 --> 00:32:31.229]  Now, to Mr. Walensky.
[00:32:31.229 --> 00:32:41.515]  Unfortunately, your position is unfortunately untenable because in the last election, you had two other choices to vote for, namely, either one of the two Michaels, but Narek or Perucco.
[00:32:41.515 --> 00:32:48.899]  Why didn't you vote for candidates who favor smaller government and would be willing to dismantle this U.S.
[00:32:48.899 --> 00:32:52.341]  oligarchy, which is turning us into a communist state?
[00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:56.663]  Well, I considered it, but I decided to go with Gary because it seemed that he had
[00:32:57.319 --> 00:33:24.921]  a reasonable chance of uh... of winning and uh... that's but what i'd go to the state republican ticket otherwise but voted for gary at the top and uh... you know the one thing i want to do that we saw today's uh... uh... uh... thinking why did i vote for that guy because he he he was pretty bad well no he was saying i want to widen the war on and i don't like the war let's increase troops uh... i mean how is that a difference
[00:33:27.134 --> 00:33:31.798]  Well, I've handled the question.
[00:33:31.798 --> 00:33:33.379]  Is there another question, sir?
[00:33:33.379 --> 00:33:36.142]  Thanks for the call, Jeffrey.
[00:33:36.142 --> 00:33:52.776]  Look, I'm not here trying to tear into you about this, but obviously, if you want to talk liberal, conservative, and then really look at evidence, growth rate of government doubling when it was under Clinton, under Bush, open borders, he's for gun control, he's signing on to UNESCO and the UN,
[00:33:54.797 --> 00:33:57.059]  Passing a national ID card.
[00:33:57.059 --> 00:34:00.822]  The New Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing.
[00:34:00.822 --> 00:34:05.206]  I mean, this guy is like Bill Clinton at warp speed.
[00:34:05.206 --> 00:34:07.308]  How do conservatives call Bush conservative?
[00:34:07.308 --> 00:34:13.993]  So I can understand how you were like, well, Kerry's the lesser of two weevils.
[00:34:13.993 --> 00:34:19.398]  Well, it has to do with economic policymaking and I think Bush's
[00:34:19.946 --> 00:34:20.186]  Well, I saw
[00:34:42.637 --> 00:34:45.460]  Well, Bush three years ago said how great a weak dollar would be.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.601]  They could have propped it up.
[00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:47.702]  But they haven't propped it up.
[00:34:47.702 --> 00:34:49.103]  It's been disastrous.
[00:34:49.103 --> 00:34:54.188]  The only way, the problem with the dollar is that the value of the dollar is determined by the Federal Reserve.
[00:34:55.345 --> 00:35:02.946]  Because they have a monopoly control over the supply of dollars, but let's leave that for another time, Alex.
[00:35:02.946 --> 00:35:03.646]  No, I agree with you.
[00:35:03.646 --> 00:35:04.987]  Let's take some calls.
[00:35:04.987 --> 00:35:06.927]  Chelsea in California.
[00:35:06.927 --> 00:35:08.067]  Chelsea, go ahead.
[00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:12.268]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the size of Iraq.
[00:35:12.268 --> 00:35:18.289]  And when you, you know, people are going, oh, we're invading, or we're winning, or we're taking over Iraq.
[00:35:18.289 --> 00:35:24.210]  I think in the back of their mind, they rationalize it by Iraq being the size of the United States
[00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:27.331]  The size of California, maybe?
[00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:36.453]  And then, I think it hits home better when you say 1 in 20 of the Iraqis have received death because of the invasion.
[00:35:36.453 --> 00:35:40.454]  And another point I wanted to make was about the borders.
[00:35:40.454 --> 00:35:42.374]  And, like, I grew up in California.
[00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:44.935]  I was born in 1962.
[00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:52.396]  And it really seems like, uh, just, I don't know, since about the 90s, that it really seems almost like an invasion.
[00:35:53.594 --> 00:36:05.800]  Well, the corporate government wants a third world population, they want lower wages, they want globalism, they want the rapid plunge downward, and that's what's happening.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.220]  Do you have a question for our guest?
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:16.264]  Well, he's very interesting, and I did serve under Reagan in Germany on a missile unit, and I'd like to hear some comments about why the
[00:36:20.356 --> 00:36:24.817]  The uniting of the Americas and what that is all about.
[00:36:24.817 --> 00:36:30.159]  Yeah, the Union of American States through the free trade deals, just like the Euro.
[00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:37.120]  I mean, you watch a C-SPAN meeting of the American leaders and they'll admit it's global government, but on the news you never hear about it.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.881]  Any comments, Jude?
[00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:47.203]  Well, again, this is... When I think of California, I think of the big border we have with Mexico and
[00:36:47.782 --> 00:36:54.129]  The influx from Mexico because of Mexico's poor economic policies.
[00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:55.891]  And I've been arguing for 25 years.
[00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:10.101]  That Mexico, if its own oligarchs change the tax and monetary and regulatory structure of the economy, they could grow at 10 and 12 percent, and they'd rather have it not grow.
[00:37:10.101 --> 00:37:12.022]  But they'd rather have it not grow.
[00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:14.745]  Illegals would be coming back to Mexico from California.
[00:37:14.745 --> 00:37:21.991]  But they'd rather have total monopoly control than have their wealth even grow.
[00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:24.653]  That's the fat cats in every country want to do that.
[00:37:24.653 --> 00:37:25.554]  That's where you find
[00:37:26.175 --> 00:37:35.524]  You know, do you realize in Mexico that if you were big enough to get traded on the Mexico Stock Exchange, you don't have to pay a capital gains tax?
[00:37:35.524 --> 00:37:38.267]  But if you're little, you have to pay the capital gains tax!
[00:37:38.267 --> 00:37:39.668]  Hey, Alex?
[00:37:39.668 --> 00:37:39.908]  Yes?
[00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:45.674]  I don't mean to interrupt you guys, but I had a discussion on a blog with a fellow who was saying that
[00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:52.809]  All Mexicans were originally Californians, and that the Marines went down to Mexico City and invaded it.
[00:37:52.809 --> 00:38:01.921]  And I always have thought, because I'm an old-time Californian... Well, that's true, and it's the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, but look, if you belong to anybody, let me just say this and I'm going to let you go.
[00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:02.141]  Okay.
[00:38:02.461 --> 00:38:04.462]  It didn't belong to anybody but the Native Americans.
[00:38:04.462 --> 00:38:05.782]  It doesn't belong to Mexico.
[00:38:05.782 --> 00:38:07.023]  It doesn't belong to Spain.
[00:38:07.023 --> 00:38:08.323]  It doesn't belong to France.
[00:38:08.323 --> 00:38:12.705]  It belongs to who builds it and creates it, and that's the American people.
[00:38:12.705 --> 00:38:24.989]  And Mexico has no claim on the Southwest, but Vicente Fox, and it says they do, and it's a major problem, and Wall Street is pushing this because they want to break this country up because it makes it easier to loot.
[00:38:24.989 --> 00:38:25.950]  Now, thanks for the call.
[00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.870]  Let me get a comment from Jude on that.
[00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.110]  Jude?
[00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:31.853]  Oh, you're in the ballpark with me.
[00:38:31.853 --> 00:38:32.954]  Oh, fine.
[00:38:32.954 --> 00:38:34.175]  Let's go to another caller.
[00:38:34.175 --> 00:38:35.576]  Yeah, let's take another.
[00:38:35.576 --> 00:38:37.377]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[00:38:37.377 --> 00:38:41.020]  Roger, go ahead.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:45.303]  Roger in Pennsylvania, go ahead now or forever hold your peace.
[00:38:45.303 --> 00:38:48.446]  Okay, let's move on.
[00:38:48.446 --> 00:38:50.467]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in New York.
[00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:53.009]  Paul, go ahead.
[00:38:53.009 --> 00:38:53.990]  Hello.
[00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.951]  Yes, Paul, go ahead.
[00:38:55.819 --> 00:39:02.761]  Dude, you were an economist under the Reagan administration, I believe, and I served under the Reagan administration, too, 15 years U.S.
[00:39:02.761 --> 00:39:06.482]  intelligence with the State and National Security Agency in Washington, D.C.
[00:39:06.482 --> 00:39:07.002]  Myself.
[00:39:07.002 --> 00:39:09.523]  I'm wondering if you're hearing the same thing I am.
[00:39:09.523 --> 00:39:18.125]  I had to get a piece of levity when Rush Limbaugh had on a BP petroleum expert saying the richest oil reserves in the world were in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:39:18.988 --> 00:39:34.239]  And yet I see the VOA, Voice of America, exploding in the last few years of all kinds of articles on the Russian pipeline, which we well know is a Russian tentacle and not one single pipeline.
[00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:36.581]  Have you been hearing the same thing?
[00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:43.966]  That the largest oil reserves in the world... You're asking questions about world energy supplies and oil supplies?
[00:39:43.966 --> 00:39:45.947]  World energy supplies.
[00:39:45.947 --> 00:39:48.569]  The richest oil reserves are in the Krasnoyarsky Mountains.
[00:39:50.834 --> 00:39:56.259]  Well, I will say that the world has not been explored for oil.
[00:39:56.259 --> 00:39:57.940]  We haven't scratched the surface.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:05.167]  There's probably a thousand times more oil that is waiting to be found in the world than we have found in the last 160 years.
[00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:09.550]  It was first discovered in Titusville, Pennsylvania.
[00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:17.313]  And there's massive reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, all over Russia, all over the Spans.
[00:40:17.313 --> 00:40:20.955]  What do you think of this peak oil line we're hearing that we're all out of oil?
[00:40:20.955 --> 00:40:23.836]  Well, that's the Hubbard Line, and that's all baloney.
[00:40:23.836 --> 00:40:34.760]  One of the things I did that you might be interested in, I tried to figure it out, this goes back 15 years ago, if you put all the oil that we've ever
[00:40:35.313 --> 00:40:40.877]  Produced and consumed in one place.
[00:40:40.877 --> 00:40:42.978]  What kind of a pool would it look like?
[00:40:42.978 --> 00:40:47.662]  And I hit upon the idea of emptying out Lake Tahoe.
[00:40:47.662 --> 00:40:50.364]  Now you know Lake Tahoe, you've been there.
[00:40:50.364 --> 00:41:00.731]  You take all the water out of Lake Tahoe and you put all the oil that we've produced through the year 2004 and you still wouldn't have filled up Lake Tahoe.
[00:41:01.587 --> 00:41:09.569]  Now you look at a map of the world and they can't even make a blue dot small enough to show you where Lake Tahoe is.
[00:41:09.569 --> 00:41:11.069]  That's how tiny it is.
[00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:18.771]  We fool ourselves into thinking that the earth is a little place and we're big people and we're using all this stuff up, but we're not.
[00:41:18.771 --> 00:41:30.634]  The world has scarcely been explored for oil and roughly three quarters of all the oil wells
[00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:37.890]  Drilled for oil and natural gas in the history of the world have been drilled in the oil patch of the United States.
[00:41:38.531 --> 00:41:48.677]  And isn't that the problem, is that the oil barons are losing control of their monopoly because all these supplies have been found, and people say, well, the Iraq war wasn't about oil because they're not shipping oil out.
[00:41:48.677 --> 00:41:53.359]  No, it's about getting control and not having that oil shipped to keep the prices actually up.
[00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:55.080]  It's about artificial scarcity.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:06.967]  Listen, all you had to... See, the reason we found all the oil here is that we're the only... Do you realize we're the only country in the world, Alex, where the citizens who own the surface rights own the mineral rights?
[00:42:06.967 --> 00:42:07.127]  Yes.
[00:42:07.127 --> 00:42:07.667]  Do you realize that?
[00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:10.029]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:10.029 --> 00:42:20.856]  There's no other... Mexico used to have, its citizens used to have the mineral rights, but in the Mexican Revolution after 1917, the government took the mineral rights back.
[00:42:20.856 --> 00:42:21.957]  Pemex.
[00:42:21.957 --> 00:42:32.963]  Well, yeah, Pemex, but this is when Bush was first elected, and right after his inaugural, he went down to meet with Vicente Fox, and I talked to Carl Rove at the time.
[00:42:32.963 --> 00:42:33.984]  He was looking for ideas.
[00:42:34.477 --> 00:42:44.289]  And I said, why don't you have the President recommend to Vicente Fox that they go back and give the citizens of Mexico the mineral rights to all the stuff they have down there.
[00:42:44.289 --> 00:42:47.473]  And they'd be swarming with wildcatters.
[00:42:47.473 --> 00:42:48.053]  Stay there!
[00:42:48.053 --> 00:42:48.654]  Stay there!
[00:42:48.654 --> 00:42:49.135]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:53.061 --> 00:43:00.724]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:43:00.724 --> 00:43:05.625]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:09.727]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:43:09.727 --> 00:43:12.668]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[00:43:12.988 --> 00:43:20.093]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[00:43:20.093 --> 00:43:28.999]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:43:28.999 --> 00:43:35.283]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[00:44:02.736 --> 00:44:03.796]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:44:03.796 --> 00:44:05.236]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:44:05.236 --> 00:44:06.256]  A 5% increase.
[00:44:06.256 --> 00:44:07.957]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:44:07.957 --> 00:44:10.377]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:44:10.377 --> 00:44:11.858]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[00:44:11.858 --> 00:44:12.578]  A 16% increase in real money.

[00:44:55.483 --> 00:45:05.056]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:45:06.115 --> 00:45:16.701]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:45:16.701 --> 00:45:22.985]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[00:46:57.699 --> 00:47:01.100]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:07.583]  Alright, our final segment with an amazing individual, we'll let Devin back up, Jude Winensky.
[00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:11.025]  Jude, I've just got a few quick questions for you that I want to hurriedly go to a few calls here.
[00:47:11.025 --> 00:47:13.646]  During the break we were talking about Serbia.
[00:47:13.646 --> 00:47:21.930]  Very stable, becoming free market, they create a bunch of propaganda, Bill Clinton goes in and blows it to pieces, and you were saying the neocons behind that again.
[00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:38.597]  Well, I was saying that when the Cold War ended, the neocons, I'm talking about Pearl and Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld, this whole project for a new American century, these are people who want an American empire with imperial outposts all over the world.
[00:47:38.597 --> 00:47:43.923]  They want to control all the government so that no one else can ever challenge us again.
[00:47:43.923 --> 00:47:46.165]  And what they did with Yugoslavia is
[00:47:46.921 --> 00:48:13.633]  With their controlled use of the International Monetary Fund, which we control, and the World Bank, which we control, we went in and told our old ally, Slobodan Milosevic, whose country was getting along just fine with the Bosnians and the Croatians and the Slovenians, that what he had to do was devalue the Dinar, which at the time, one Dinar was worth $25,
[00:48:15.509 --> 00:48:17.750]  In order to get into the free market.
[00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:27.012]  And they knew that this process called shock therapy would cause the destabilization of Yugoslavia.
[00:48:27.012 --> 00:48:28.133]  And of course it did.
[00:48:28.133 --> 00:48:29.533]  A huge inflation took over.
[00:48:29.533 --> 00:48:31.053]  Listen, you've met with the neocons.
[00:48:31.053 --> 00:48:36.995]  This so-called shock therapy, and Joseph Stiglitz has quit about it and all this at the World Bank, is meant to destroy economies.
[00:48:36.995 --> 00:48:38.155]  It's not free market.
[00:48:38.155 --> 00:48:40.736]  It's meant to blow them to pieces so they can then loot them.
[00:48:41.391 --> 00:48:53.019]  Well, one of the things that's unusual here is that the Liberal Democrats, this is Jeffrey Sachs who now is at the United Nations, and Jeffrey Sachs really believed that shock therapy was the right way to go.
[00:48:53.019 --> 00:48:55.621]  So the New York Times got behind it.
[00:48:55.621 --> 00:49:05.068]  Now the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which I used to be associate editor of back in the old Cold War days, they knew that it was going to unravel.
[00:49:05.068 --> 00:49:06.009]  So they supported
[00:49:07.083 --> 00:49:09.124]  The shock therapy at the same time.
[00:49:09.124 --> 00:49:15.609]  So you have the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal both supporting the idea, and the Russians, Gorbachev, says, hey, this must work.
[00:49:15.609 --> 00:49:17.891]  So he tried it, and it blew up the country.
[00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:25.577]  Now I would add to this, at the same time, our loving government even used some Al-Qaeda to get the war going in Kosovo.
[00:49:25.577 --> 00:49:30.701]  So it just shows what complete whores these people are when it comes to politics.
[00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:34.404]  You actually teach economics for free every weekend on your website.
[00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:35.065]  Tell folks about that.
[00:49:35.225 --> 00:49:38.968]  Well, it's Supply Side University, and I've been doing this for eight years.
[00:49:38.968 --> 00:49:42.131]  I have more than 3,000 students all around the world.
[00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:46.255]  Well, you just come into winiski.com and you register to get my daily memo.
[00:49:46.255 --> 00:49:49.718]  You can also register to free get my weekly lesson.
[00:49:49.718 --> 00:49:54.843]  We just started a new semester two weeks ago with an introduction to economics.
[00:49:54.843 --> 00:49:56.805]  You can catch up with the introduction.
[00:49:57.487 --> 00:50:02.529]  And it's the only place, really, in the country where you can learn classical economics.
[00:50:02.529 --> 00:50:03.149]  Our forefathers thought.
[00:50:03.149 --> 00:50:04.609]  Well, I really think that the forces at work now
[00:50:17.626 --> 00:50:19.227]  Uh, are going to push us out.
[00:50:19.227 --> 00:50:22.770]  We'll have to get out the same way that we got out of Vietnam.
[00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:36.601]  Because, uh, the American people are, they can take so much of this fooling around, uh, just so long, and it will be clear by, uh, closer to the end of the year that this insurgency is not being stopped.
[00:50:36.986 --> 00:50:44.214]  That it's getting bigger, and it's getting worse, and that the probabilities are that things will get better once we get out.
[00:50:44.214 --> 00:50:45.856]  But the neocons knew.
[00:50:45.856 --> 00:50:47.859]  Their top brass told them all.
[00:50:47.859 --> 00:50:49.741]  They ran corporation assessments.
[00:50:49.741 --> 00:50:51.222]  They all told them this would happen.
[00:50:51.222 --> 00:50:52.123]  They knew it would happen.
[00:50:52.123 --> 00:50:53.685]  Why did they do it?
[00:50:53.685 --> 00:50:57.630]  Well, because their plan, they had a different agenda.
[00:50:58.208 --> 00:51:04.812]  They have been wanting to get control of... But that brings Israel into the picture, and that's a whole new show!
[00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:17.840]  If we're to want to get Israel and the Palestinian issue, because at least the predominant, Richard Perle and Wolfowitz, you know, have long ties to the Likud party in Tel Aviv.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:26.825]  And there are interests that the Israelis have with Kirkuk Oil, and that's why they're aligned with the Kurds in Iraq,
[00:51:27.296 --> 00:51:31.417]  So it's, you know, as they say Alex, it's one big mosaic.
[00:51:31.417 --> 00:51:34.578]  And that would take another show.
[00:51:34.578 --> 00:51:35.358]  It's amazing.
[00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:38.939]  So Israel, basically manipulating internal politics, says, so what?
[00:51:38.939 --> 00:51:40.320]  What happens to our GIs?
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.960]  We want this and we'll use you as a tool to do it.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.381]  But again, I would agree with you that you're saying that's only a piece of it.
[00:51:46.381 --> 00:51:47.021]  Right.
[00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:48.942]  Listen, no more time to take calls.
[00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:50.002]  I apologize to the callers.
[00:51:50.002 --> 00:51:52.783]  I'll go to your callers after the break, get to a bunch of other news.
[00:51:53.483 --> 00:51:57.545]  But Jude Winensky, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, retired from there.
[00:51:57.545 --> 00:52:02.207]  Of course, a renowned political economist, former advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[00:52:02.207 --> 00:52:08.030]  I want to get you back up in the near future, and I appreciate your honesty talking about this out-of-control empire.
[00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:14.433]  I see the biggest threat, though, is the empire destroying American freedom and the looting of the Pentagon funds.
[00:52:15.624 --> 00:52:18.586]  Okay, well, we'll be back and talk about that sometime.
[00:52:18.586 --> 00:52:19.447]  Alright, good to talk to you.
[00:52:19.447 --> 00:52:20.328]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:52:20.328 --> 00:52:20.648]  You bet.
[00:52:20.648 --> 00:52:22.389]  Wenensky.com, thank you.
[00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:35.538]  Alright, we'll be back with your calls, just a plethora, a cornucopia, just a huge plane of news and information to discuss as we engage in another sortie into information warfare.
[00:52:35.538 --> 00:52:39.061]  I'm Alex Jones, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:52:42.157 --> 00:52:45.238]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:52:45.238 --> 00:52:51.859]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:51.859 --> 00:52:56.820]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:05.681]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:53:05.681 --> 00:53:08.122]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[00:53:08.122 --> 00:53:08.722]  While you listen,
[00:53:09.398 --> 00:53:14.721]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:16.822]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:53:16.822 --> 00:53:19.563]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:22.164]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:53:22.164 --> 00:53:23.965]  And it's so easy.
[00:53:23.965 --> 00:53:26.826]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:53:26.826 --> 00:53:27.967]  When you want.
[00:53:27.967 --> 00:53:29.428]  Where you want.
[00:53:29.428 --> 00:53:34.350]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[00:53:35.262 --> 00:53:38.104]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[00:53:38.104 --> 00:53:38.905]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:53:38.905 --> 00:53:39.385]  That's 419-W-O-R-D.
[00:53:39.385 --> 00:53:39.526]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:53:52.003 --> 00:53:57.365]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:53:57.365 --> 00:54:05.709]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:12.752]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:54:12.932 --> 00:54:14.313]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:54:14.313 --> 00:54:20.378]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:54:20.378 --> 00:54:25.602]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:54:25.602 --> 00:54:34.750]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.273]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:54:39.974 --> 00:54:40.634]  We're good to go!

[00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:45.578]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:55:58.999 --> 00:56:04.582]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:56:04.582 --> 00:56:12.207]  You know, we had Jude Winensky on, who really is the father of supply-side economics.
[00:56:12.207 --> 00:56:16.789]  And a chief advisor to Ronald Reagan, Wall Street Journal associate editor.
[00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:21.052]  Telling his friends, he has Karl Rove calling him up for advice.
[00:56:21.052 --> 00:56:22.713]  Friends of all these people went to college with him.
[00:56:25.279 --> 00:56:36.509]  Telling us it's world government, they're getting rid of the Constitution, they're taking our freedoms, they knew we wouldn't win in Iraq, they knew our troops would die en masse, and they just don't care!
[00:56:36.509 --> 00:56:41.813]  Just openly admitting it, and saying it is a world conspiracy.
[00:56:41.813 --> 00:56:46.057]  Congressman Ron Paul comes on this show and tells you it's a world government conspiracy.
[00:56:46.057 --> 00:56:47.458]  I have it in my film Matrix of Evil.
[00:56:47.458 --> 00:56:50.260]  He says it is a world government takeover conspiracy.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.421]  They openly say it!
[00:56:52.851 --> 00:57:03.836]  In published books they write, that they put out, and still Russ Limbaugh says it doesn't exist, Sean Hannity, Michael Weiner, all of them!
[00:57:03.836 --> 00:57:05.936]  It's amazing!
[00:57:05.936 --> 00:57:15.300]  We're going to post that interview at personplanted.tv in the next few days, but you ought to have your friends and family who call themselves conservatives, you know, go listen to that and go, this is not conservatism!
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.081]  I mean, it's not conservatism!
[00:57:18.757 --> 00:57:36.312]  We have a pack of abortionist-promoting, gun-grabbing, open-border-pushing, world-government-creating, cashless-society-control-grid-implementing, vicious demons taking control.
[00:57:36.312 --> 00:57:40.196]  And it's time for people to get out of denial and admit what we're watching.
