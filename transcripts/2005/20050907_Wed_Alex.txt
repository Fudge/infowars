[00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:06.335]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:08.055]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:09.936]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:11.336]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:12.997]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:21.920]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.022]  We're good to go.
[00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:00.538]  What do you call yourself?
[00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:01.358]  A conservative?
[00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.059]  A liberal?
[00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:03.560]  A libertarian?
[00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:06.803]  What type of radio show is this?
[00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:09.845]  And I'd say simply, it's real talk radio.
[00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:17.991]  Real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:01:20.072 --> 00:01:23.894]  And I always come down on the side of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:01:23.914 --> 00:01:37.581]  I mean, if you want to know where I stand, we have so many new listeners every millisecond tuning in on our AM and FM affiliates across the country and on shortwave and the internet and satellite as well.
[00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:41.043]  I believe in freedom.
[00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:43.925]  I believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:48.207]  I believe in George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:51.173]  I believe in freedom.
[00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.434]  I believe in a rule of law.
[00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:58.775]  I believe that the government is not our god and is not our master.
[00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:07.897]  And I believe that government is deadly dangerous and throughout history the most dangerous force that free peoples ever contend with.
[00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:19.360]  And I know that we have a very evil, manipulative, deceptive military-industrial complex that is owned by the large global banks based in Europe
[00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:23.238]  And that they are turning America into a high-tech police state.
[00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:28.119]  And there, I said the word military-industrial complex.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.380]  Oh my gosh, I don't support the troops.
[00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:37.922]  That's the dumbed-down general population that we have in many cases.
[00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:43.524]  No, I said the military-industrial complex.
[00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:49.646]  That Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of European...
[00:02:50.485 --> 00:03:01.248]  Operations, that as he was leaving his farewell speech in 1960, he said, beware the military-industrial complex.
[00:03:02.028 --> 00:03:19.712]  That's the private organizations and entities that have grown up around military actions and that have grown up around wars that the banks themselves have orchestrated to then consolidate wealth and power.
[00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:29.062]  And the globalists found out that wars were so profitable that they'd have to have dozens of other wars.
[00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:36.505]  Not just the conventional combat at arms or physical conflict.
[00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:44.328]  Why, they could have a war against poverty, a war against drugs, a war against terror, a war against natural disaster.
[00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:46.025]  I think?
[00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:04.799]  Why, they'll just have to carry out a terror attack.
[00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.642]  Or they'll have to ship in the drugs to create the crisis.
[00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:17.252]  Or they'll go in and break up the families to have the war on child abuse when the government is five times more likely to abuse children.
[00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:21.817]  It's like having Satan investigate Beelzebub.
[00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:27.260]  So that's my opening salvo there today.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.765]  We will plunge into the news on Hurricane Katrina, also on the Supreme Court dual vacancy.
[00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.366]  What's going on right now?
[00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:41.771]  One of the grandfathers of the truth movement is joining us in about 55 minutes, Eustace Mullins.
[00:04:42.352 --> 00:04:43.313]  You don't want to miss that.

[00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:59.413]  Watch those sites for continual developments.
[00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:05.428]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:07.269]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:12.272]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:17.054]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:21.637]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:22.357]  We're good to go.
[00:05:51.857 --> 00:05:55.360]  That's Infowars.com or AAA 2533139.
[00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:59.304]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:01.937 --> 00:06:04.798]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:08.019]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:14.461]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.821 --> 00:06:22.144]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:26.385]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:07:01.693 --> 00:07:04.054]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:08.135]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:08.455 --> 00:07:09.275]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:13.817]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:18.238]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.618 --> 00:07:23.480]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.462]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:32.986]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:35.988]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:37.189]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:08.592]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.212 --> 00:08:12.175]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:27.700]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.680]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.381]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:37.401]  And we're going to have wide open phones throughout the three hour broadcast today.
[00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:42.562]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.663]  You're welcome to talk about how FEMA has been caught with their pants down.
[00:08:48.191 --> 00:09:09.084]  We now have an article here with a synopsis with over ten examples of FEMA caught sabotaging relief efforts, cutting power lines, cutting police communications lines, refusing to let food and water in, shooting people, shooting Army Corps of Engineers.
[00:09:09.745 --> 00:09:14.888]  I mean, it is unbelievable, and it's hidden in plain view.
[00:09:16.983 --> 00:09:18.324]  Just right out in the open.
[00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:19.905]  It comes out on Fox.
[00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:21.306]  They report it on CNN.
[00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:24.588]  I even saw a blurb last night on MSNBC.
[00:09:25.088 --> 00:09:27.290]  But it's just, oh, FEMA got, they're really dumb.
[00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.250]  They're really stupid.
[00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:31.793]  They got caught cutting more communications lines.
[00:09:32.593 --> 00:09:33.434]  Boy, they're dumb.
[00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:43.120]  That'd be like if I walked into a bank, pulled out a 45, and said, put all the money in these little bags.
[00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:51.439]  And then as I was walking out the front of the building, the police were behind their squad cars and they said, Drop it!
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.901]  And I dropped my gun and I said, Oh, sorry officers, I just screwed up.
[00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:01.682]  I'm just inept.
[00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.283]  And they said, That's okay, you can go.
[00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:07.704]  Because you said that you were just inept.
[00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:10.685]  You see, they're mislabeling it.
[00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:26.908]  The media is admitting that they're cutting power lines and cutting communications lines and not letting food and water in and literally going around in their boats all over the city, not rescuing people, stopping the police and others from rescuing people.
[00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:33.395]  I mean, I have two different reports here alone with Sean Penn.
[00:10:35.028 --> 00:10:41.552]  I'm not a particular fan of some of his policies and some of his ideas, though I agree with him on the Iraq War, but regardless, I know him to be honest.
[00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:46.035]  And he's reporting what we're also getting from police that have been resigning.
[00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:51.036]  That he's out there driving around the city all day in this boat with some other rescuers.
[00:10:51.557 --> 00:11:01.660]  And the whole day, all over the city, they saw two other rescue boats and then two other boats that had FEMA people in them.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:10.283]  And they witnessed the FEMA people making jokes to women up on top of a building.
[00:11:10.523 --> 00:11:12.324]  They're screaming for help, help, help.
[00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.725]  And the police say, show us what you got.
[00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.084]  Lifting their shirts up.
[00:11:18.184 --> 00:11:22.266]  Show us, you know, the FEMA police, show us what you've got and we'll help you.
[00:11:24.427 --> 00:11:30.329]  And that's the other reports we've gotten confirmed, that the military was told to stand around, play cards, smoke cigarettes.
[00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:38.153]  People are dying, and we're talking last week, and begging for help, and they're just basically aiming machine guns at them.
[00:11:38.753 --> 00:11:40.134]  And I do have it on videotape.
[00:11:40.154 --> 00:11:42.395]  I happened to be recording when it happened, General Honoré.
[00:11:43.488 --> 00:11:50.450]  I was running through the city blowing up at police and blowing up at military for basically not helping people and just pointing machine guns at them.
[00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.231]  Just like it's fun.
[00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:56.231]  This is the big power trip of their lives.
[00:11:56.652 --> 00:12:08.075]  These cops and guardsmen and regular army live in little apartments and drive Pintos and don't have any money, don't feel like they have any personal power, so it's all about getting your game on.
[00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:08.335]  Getting to
[00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:11.556]  Getting to shove people around.
[00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:17.359]  Now, obviously, there's a lot of police and a lot of military that were humanitarians that were doing a good job.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:25.664]  My only point is that when you get corruption in government, it's worse than just general run-of-the-mill corruption because it runs wild.
[00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:26.705]  It runs unabated.
[00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:28.686]  They're the authorities.
[00:12:28.786 --> 00:12:30.607]  They're the officials.
[00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.649]  And nothing can really be done.
[00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.452]  They can just feed on us and basically be as abusive as they want.
[00:12:40.934 --> 00:12:50.039]  And, I mean, it is such a big deal to have FEMA caught red-handed sabotaging from day one, from Monday through today.
[00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:51.760]  More and more reports.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.063]  We are now confirming reports that FEMA last week was breaking levies.
[00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:00.144]  The quote, let the water out.
[00:13:00.284 --> 00:13:06.487]  And that's like a, as one of my friends said last night, that's like a Three Stooges episode.
[00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:22.988]  Where Moe, with a hammer, knocks a hole in the bottom of the little rowboat they're in, and the water starts coming in, and so Curly, to let the water out, screws a hole down into the boat to let the water in.
[00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:25.109]  I mean, to let that water out.
[00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:32.615]  So Mo knocks a hole to let the water in, and then Curly or Larry screws a hole to let the water out.
[00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:40.961]  And I mean, obviously, if the water is higher than water on the other side, and the Ponza train knocking a hole out, sure, that would let it equalize.
[00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:46.606]  But you don't want to do that because it's hurricane season, it's storm season for another month and a half.
[00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.952]  You want to repair all those and then pump it out.
[00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:58.858]  You don't want to knock holes in it, because then obviously when it equalizes, you're still going to have a problem with water there in the hole.
[00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:01.481]  And see, that was just their cover story.
[00:14:01.521 --> 00:14:02.601]  It was hidden in plain view.
[00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:04.683]  FEMA was actually sabotaging.
[00:14:05.204 --> 00:14:07.746]  FEMA repeatedly ordered troops...
[00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:20.869]  And FEMA guards to open fire on Army Corps of Engineers and on Special Forces engineers and others that were in there.
[00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:25.612]  And this is not a case of friendly fire, folks.
[00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:26.933]  Something is going on.
[00:14:28.007 --> 00:14:48.773]  I mean, when you've got three parishes that we know of with armed guards guarding police communications towers and guarding water supplies and guarding the highways, checking IDs, not allowing FEMA into their parishes because, quote, they are engaging in sabotage, as two parish sheriffs have said.
[00:14:48.793 --> 00:14:56.615]  I mean, when you catch them not asking you, sneaking around in the dark, cutting your communications lines, you start putting two and two together.
[00:14:57.722 --> 00:15:00.184]  And a lot of police are going, I just can't believe it.
[00:15:00.284 --> 00:15:01.025]  I just can't.
[00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:03.007]  I just can't believe FEMA.
[00:15:03.107 --> 00:15:04.228]  I work with FEMA people.
[00:15:04.268 --> 00:15:04.968]  They're good.
[00:15:05.729 --> 00:15:07.991]  It's like every other agency or organization.
[00:15:08.672 --> 00:15:10.954]  Most of the people in the organization are not bad.
[00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:14.417]  Though in the BATF, that's not really the case.
[00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:15.898]  These are criminal individuals.
[00:15:16.702 --> 00:15:17.862]  In my experience and research.
[00:15:17.963 --> 00:15:21.384]  Well, in FEMA, you've got a higher percentage of criminals and sociopaths.
[00:15:21.564 --> 00:15:23.064]  Well, they admittedly, it's come out in the news.
[00:15:23.284 --> 00:15:24.625]  In fact, that's stuff we ought to post.
[00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:25.445]  I just remembered that.
[00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:44.592]  The last hurricanes last year in Florida, it came out how they would hire FEMA people who were bank robbers and killers and wife beaters and drug dealers and how a huge percentage of them were like hardcore criminals with giant swastika tattoos around their huge biceps.
[00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.337]  Well, Stalin and Hitler knew this.
[00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:55.123]  Hitler's brown shirts that took him to power, that he stormed to power with, they were predominantly hardcore criminals, folks.
[00:15:56.264 --> 00:15:57.845]  I mean, that's who will do the job.
[00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:01.628]  That's who will beat up people and kill people and rape and kill.
[00:16:02.088 --> 00:16:04.850]  That's who you have men get in there and cut the communications lines.
[00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.092]  Yeah, we like it.
[00:16:07.352 --> 00:16:08.093]  We like doing it.
[00:16:09.293 --> 00:16:10.174]  We like power.
[00:16:10.454 --> 00:16:12.094]  Baby, why don't you come on down here?
[00:16:12.114 --> 00:16:13.075]  You want me to rescue you?
[00:16:13.195 --> 00:16:15.396]  You're looking pretty good today.
[00:16:16.436 --> 00:16:17.817]  I mean, literally, that's what they're doing.
[00:16:18.217 --> 00:16:19.858]  Let me lick my lips, baby.
[00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.599]  A female wants to help you.
[00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:26.981]  So they've just emptied out the prisons, and I forgot about that.
[00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.982]  Again, more pieces fall together by the millisecond.
[00:16:30.002 --> 00:16:34.805]  I remember a bunch of articles out of Florida where a huge percentage were hardcore criminals.
[00:16:34.845 --> 00:16:35.705]  I mean, violent criminals.
[00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:42.135]  Violent felons in FEMA refused to fire them, quote, when it was discovered as if they didn't know.
[00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:45.637]  Right out of the hardcore pens.
[00:16:46.977 --> 00:16:50.759]  I wonder how the cops feel working right next to hardcore people out of the pen.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.980]  And it isn't just some pot dealer out of the pen.
[00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:54.481]  Remember that.
[00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:58.703]  They don't want some nice long-haired hippie that wants to help people with a criminal record.
[00:16:58.943 --> 00:17:00.724]  They want hardcore criminals.
[00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:01.824]  Oh, you're doubting me.
[00:17:01.864 --> 00:17:05.406]  The Washington Post and the Washington Times two years ago reported...
[00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.531]  That the U.S.
[00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:14.779]  government was giving amnesty to people who were aggravated felons if they were from Latin America.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.081]  Oh, do a LexisNexis search.
[00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:17.742]  Do a Google search.
[00:17:17.982 --> 00:17:19.784]  We've got it on InfoWars and in the archives.
[00:17:20.324 --> 00:17:21.746]  Actual felons.
[00:17:22.206 --> 00:17:23.187]  But not just felons.
[00:17:23.568 --> 00:17:25.470]  You've got to be hardcore.
[00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:28.053]  And then you get to join the U.S.
[00:17:28.233 --> 00:17:28.413]  Army.
[00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:36.979]  And now 24% of the force on the ground in Iraq is Latin American who were illegal aliens and instantly legalized.
[00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:39.682]  Huge recruiting offices in Mexico City.
[00:17:40.202 --> 00:17:42.965]  Huge recruiting offices in Nuevo Laredo.
[00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:46.709]  Huge recruiting offices all over Latin America.
[00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:48.491]  And they fly them up here.
[00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:58.798]  They fly them up here in a business class ticket and they get off and they go sign those papers and they don't speak a lick of English, but they're aggravated felons.
[00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:01.280]  They go right to the top of the charts.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.781]  So I've forgotten about that.
[00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:05.743]  We need to call my writers, my webmasters.
[00:18:06.844 --> 00:18:10.687]  We need to get those articles where FEMA hires criminals.
[00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:15.193]  And if we're too busy to get it done, other websites, you should get it done.
[00:18:15.534 --> 00:18:16.554]  Or listeners, you should get it done.
[00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:17.775]  Do your Google search.
[00:18:18.136 --> 00:18:20.137]  FEMA hiring felons.
[00:18:20.237 --> 00:18:25.501]  FEMA caught... FEMA... What were the headlines from last year?
[00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:26.462]  Let me bring one up.
[00:18:27.422 --> 00:18:32.927]  FEMA... Something like FEMA... It wasn't FEMA officials.
[00:18:32.947 --> 00:18:37.050]  It was something like FEMA bosses convicted felons.
[00:18:38.691 --> 00:18:38.731]  Um...
[00:18:39.372 --> 00:18:42.254]  There were a whole bunch of articles, but you can find it with keyword searches.
[00:18:42.974 --> 00:18:46.836]  And they're all there right now in New Orleans having a good time.
[00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:54.520]  They're having a good, good, good, good time right now.
[00:18:55.421 --> 00:19:00.543]  And you're all being trained to give your rights up, to give your freedoms up, to be good little slaves.
[00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:07.087]  You're all being trained to give up, quote, liberty, and that you will supposedly get security.
[00:19:08.024 --> 00:19:09.965]  And that is not the case, folks.
[00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:12.187]  You give up liberty, you get tyranny.
[00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:14.749]  And I'm not kidding about this.
[00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:16.290]  I'm not joking about this.
[00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.592]  This is very, very, very serious.
[00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:25.676]  It is a fact that the military hires aggravated felons from Latin America.
[00:19:26.577 --> 00:19:31.060]  Even ABC News reported they're hiring all the former death squad people who work in Iraq.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.861]  It is a fact.
[00:19:33.921 --> 00:19:36.103]  It is a fact that FEMA hires criminals.
[00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:38.710]  Because criminals will follow orders.
[00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:42.452]  Because criminals will enjoy themselves.
[00:19:43.152 --> 00:19:45.513]  Because they'll do bad things.
[00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:49.315]  That is, they'll follow unlawful orders, to be more precise.
[00:19:51.016 --> 00:19:53.878]  They like to exercise power on you and your family.
[00:19:54.758 --> 00:19:56.379]  They enjoy breaking up families.
[00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:06.488]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of different medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.409]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:20:08.569 --> 00:20:11.251]  Yes, I said drinking water, but not just any water.
[00:20:11.451 --> 00:20:15.713]  You need electrolyzed oxidized water, or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:25.019]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:25.980]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:44.038]  Orally to treat sore throats, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:50.260]  Try any of RPA Biotech's electrolyzed oxidizing water solutions for a full 30-day satisfaction guarantee.

[00:20:54.822 --> 00:20:55.223]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:05.077]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:21:05.337 --> 00:21:08.858]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:08.938 --> 00:21:12.879]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:19.260]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:27.582]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:33.324]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:33.484 --> 00:21:37.245]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:39.485]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:21:39.545 --> 00:21:41.686]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:46.888]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91, or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:21:46.928 --> 00:21:51.029]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:21:51.929 --> 00:21:53.730]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.510]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.831]  Protect your family.
[00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:57.572]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:57.592 --> 00:21:57.972]  Inflation.
[00:21:58.132 --> 00:21:58.972]  One and the same.
[00:21:59.072 --> 00:22:06.836]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:18.948 --> 00:22:22.154]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:22.535 --> 00:22:23.236]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:24.619]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:31.756]  Here is reality.
[00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:35.698]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:36.739 --> 00:22:40.421]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.181 --> 00:22:45.764]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.844 --> 00:22:49.646]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:22:50.147 --> 00:22:51.608]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.668 --> 00:22:51.908]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:03.974 --> 00:23:11.400]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:23:12.481 --> 00:23:22.149]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:29.655]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:23:30.603 --> 00:23:39.470]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.551]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:41.872]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:42.052]  Call now.
[00:23:42.072 --> 00:23:47.456]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:24:08.411 --> 00:24:11.091]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:12.012]  until 2 p.m.
[00:24:12.112 --> 00:24:14.912]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:24:14.952 --> 00:24:15.572]  We're here, folks.
[00:24:15.853 --> 00:24:16.833]  Real talk radio.
[00:24:17.253 --> 00:24:20.494]  Real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:23.874]  Charles in Louisiana has been calling and giving us reports for the last week.
[00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:27.155]  Robert, Tim, Jason, and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:24:27.975 --> 00:24:30.176]  They're going to forcibly remove the people of the city.
[00:24:30.908 --> 00:24:34.431]  They estimate that 10,000 or more people are still in the city.
[00:24:35.051 --> 00:24:42.877]  They guesstimate that over 10,000 people, or around 10,000 people, I've seen different reports, they say as many as 20,000, as many as 10,000.
[00:24:42.977 --> 00:24:49.562]  I don't think they know, but the conservative estimate, we hope that's on the right side of things, is 10,000 dead.
[00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:58.125]  But now, you've got about 30% of the city, because the water has receded from about 10% more of the city.
[00:24:58.145 --> 00:25:01.907]  So already, 20% of the city was not underwater.
[00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:06.989]  And a lot of that was the wealthier, middle-class areas.
[00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:18.495]  It was the 9th Ward kind of welfare crowd and some of the disadvantaged folks that were down deep in the bowl, 20 feet below sea level.
[00:25:19.578 --> 00:25:25.381]  But about 20% of the city was up above that and did not flood.
[00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:27.001]  These are nice, middle-class homes.
[00:25:27.441 --> 00:25:29.042]  Some of them are very wealthy areas.
[00:25:29.242 --> 00:25:32.143]  The French Quarter, the entertainment tourist district.
[00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.744]  And people have food.
[00:25:34.764 --> 00:25:35.465]  They have water.
[00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:37.145]  They have water filters, a lot of them.
[00:25:37.986 --> 00:25:40.647]  And most of these 10,000 people, as you already know...
[00:25:41.744 --> 00:25:46.648]  This has been talked about ad infinitum, but it's important to really focus in on why this is happening.
[00:25:46.948 --> 00:25:53.533]  They try to get their 10-year-old dog that they sleep with, that they love, that they take to the vet.
[00:25:56.275 --> 00:25:58.898]  They tell them, no, you can't take your Boston Terrier.
[00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:00.419]  You can't take your Chihuahua.
[00:26:00.879 --> 00:26:02.480]  You can't take your Irish Setter.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.042]  You can't take your German Shepherd.
[00:26:04.502 --> 00:26:08.125]  You can't take your tabby cat, your calico cat.
[00:26:09.106 --> 00:26:10.907]  You can't take your box turtle.
[00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:12.820]  You know, to the little 10-year-old.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.062]  And so these people are saying... I mean, the helicopters have shown it, and every time they see it, they cut away.
[00:26:18.082 --> 00:26:25.545]  It's almost like there's a written rule to not show it, but people in swimming pools and people on their roofs sunbathing and people having parties.
[00:26:25.565 --> 00:26:30.086]  You know, there's a lot of self-sufficient people that are saying this all is a big vacation.
[00:26:30.747 --> 00:26:38.130]  And their job's destroyed, and they can't get to their bank account, but in between them and their neighbors, they got a three-month supply of food because they were smart.
[00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.970]  They lived in New Orleans, after all.
[00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.231]  A lot of folks did get prepared.
[00:26:41.957 --> 00:26:44.680]  And so they're not anywhere near the fetid water.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.883]  And they know if they leave, FEMA may just take their house.
[00:26:47.903 --> 00:26:48.924]  FEMA's done this many times.
[00:26:49.444 --> 00:26:58.773]  And so they're saying, no, you don't let me take my dog that I love, that's a member of the family, that sleeps at the foot of the bed, that brings me my slippers in the newspaper every day.
[00:26:58.793 --> 00:27:01.876]  I mean, my dogs are members of the family, folks.
[00:27:03.077 --> 00:27:06.961]  I mean, you know, it's me and my wife and the Boston Terrier in between us.
[00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:07.281]  I was...
[00:27:08.314 --> 00:27:12.077]  I was hugging on my dog last night when I finally got in bed at 4 a.m.
[00:27:12.637 --> 00:27:14.058]  after I was on Coast to Coast a.m.
[00:27:14.098 --> 00:27:14.558]  last night.
[00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:24.845]  I was just hugging my dog, my favorite dog, a Boston Terrier, and I was just thinking I would not abandon him unless my children were in danger.
[00:27:24.885 --> 00:27:26.586]  I'd leave that dog in five seconds.
[00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:31.430]  But again, there'd be no reason to not let you have your dog.
[00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.591]  It's just totally cruel.
[00:27:33.371 --> 00:27:35.372]  And now my wife is on this jagged,
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.601]  Of wanting to adopt some of these people's animals.
[00:27:40.641 --> 00:27:41.181]  And I told her.
[00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:44.062]  I can't tell her anything.
[00:27:44.082 --> 00:27:45.502]  And now I'm going to end up with more animals.
[00:27:46.463 --> 00:27:47.743]  And then I'll end up liking them.
[00:27:47.783 --> 00:27:49.864]  And then the people won't want them back.
[00:27:49.944 --> 00:27:53.005]  And then I'll end up having a bunch of more dogs.
[00:27:55.145 --> 00:28:00.127]  You ought to try doing a coast-to-coast radio interview with a chihuahua running around begging for food at your feet.
[00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:01.948]  At 4 a.m.
[00:28:02.028 --> 00:28:03.248]  it just never ends.
[00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:05.869]  But it's hard to get mad at the chihuahua.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.542]  That dog is out of control.
[00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:15.906]  But now I'm going to have more of them thanks to this disaster that the government really orchestrated.
[00:28:16.907 --> 00:28:18.308]  But that's what you've got to do.
[00:28:18.388 --> 00:28:21.170]  But to make a long story short, I'm babbling.
[00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.930]  We're going to go to break.
[00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.232]  We'll come back straight to Charles and others that are holding.
[00:28:25.252 --> 00:28:25.332]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:25.352 --> 00:28:26.994]  I'm going to go quickly through your calls.
[00:28:30.274 --> 00:28:37.536]  And the police chief is saying he's got orders from the mayor with FEMA to go in there and start forcibly removing people.
[00:28:39.037 --> 00:28:45.599]  And you're going to see, again, nice images of SWAT teams raiding homes and raiding families because people won't give up their dogs.
[00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:58.262]  I mean, I have no problem with the police going in to looters that aren't in their property who are staying in somebody else's house, defecating on the floor,
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.960]  You know, with a bunch of stolen jewelry.
[00:29:03.581 --> 00:29:14.124]  But the police should go knock on the door, say, come to the door, and if people could show the police, you know, the photos of themselves in the house and that it's their home, that's what freedom's all about.
[00:29:14.164 --> 00:29:19.866]  If they want to stay in the home and it's up to their, you know, own devices, that's freedom.
[00:29:19.946 --> 00:29:20.226]  Leave them.
[00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:31.009]  Now, if the cops come to the door and somebody's sneaking around inside there and they say, come to the door, and... I mean, certainly, you need to deal with some of the pockets of
[00:29:31.852 --> 00:29:34.713]  Greedy looters that are in there, but the majority of people are not.
[00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:37.314]  And how do you expect them to leave?
[00:29:37.354 --> 00:29:39.214]  I mean, let me ask the police this.
[00:29:39.854 --> 00:29:43.095]  I mean, if people told you to give up your dog at 10, 12 years, would you do it?
[00:29:43.696 --> 00:29:44.296]  Could you do it?
[00:29:44.396 --> 00:29:45.216]  No, you wouldn't do it.
[00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:46.656]  So don't be hypocrites.
[00:29:47.297 --> 00:29:49.497]  We'll be right back with your calls to us.
[00:29:51.838 --> 00:29:52.738]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.218 --> 00:29:54.839]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.739 --> 00:29:58.420]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:08.164]  The fifth annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:08.364 --> 00:30:10.926]  Door prizes, free drawings, and non-stop fun.
[00:30:11.187 --> 00:30:11.987]  Featuring the Ms.
[00:30:12.027 --> 00:30:20.094]  Minnesota Senior Pageant, Dr. Dale Anderson, who prescribes laughter for health, the Plymouth Playhouse Church Basement Ladies, the Silver Sneakers, and more.
[00:30:20.634 --> 00:30:24.999]  Learn all about the new Medicare prescription plan from the Social Security Administration.
[00:30:25.019 --> 00:30:26.140]  See a fashion show.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.982]  Have fun with the bees and Mariner and the Magic Man.
[00:30:29.222 --> 00:30:30.784]  There's something new every hour.
[00:30:30.804 --> 00:30:34.387]  All this, plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[00:30:34.788 --> 00:30:38.491]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:41.634]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:43.035 --> 00:30:47.436]  For discount tickets, visit 101expos.com or call 612-798-7256.
[00:30:47.676 --> 00:30:56.499]  Sponsored in part by Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, KSTC, KSTP, Medica, and Ebenezer.
[00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:59.900]  Save the date, September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:07.706]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:13.988]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:22.709]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:29.971]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:35.094]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.314 --> 00:31:40.718]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.078 --> 00:31:44.140]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.481 --> 00:31:52.446]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.486 --> 00:31:53.066]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:02.153]  Walmart, Walgreens, and Eckerd's.
[00:32:24.131 --> 00:32:24.792]  We're good to go.
[00:32:44.827 --> 00:32:49.510]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.750]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.046 --> 00:33:19.468]  Alright, we are going to your calls momentarily.
[00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.674]  I have made 12 documentary films, and I think they're pretty good.
[00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:36.141]  Listeners, and many people across the country, say they're the best truth-seeking patriot documentaries bar none.
[00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:38.503]  I know this, they cover the most information.
[00:33:39.136 --> 00:33:43.299]  My new film, Martial Law, notice how that fits in with what you're now seeing happening.
[00:33:43.859 --> 00:33:48.582]  Martial Law 911, Rise of the Police State, is really a miniseries.
[00:33:49.422 --> 00:33:51.183]  Three hours long.
[00:33:52.044 --> 00:33:54.205]  It's really three hours on the nose.
[00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:58.568]  Three hours and 45 seconds, if you really want to be precise.
[00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:02.090]  And I'm proud.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.102]  I'm proud of this documentary.
[00:34:05.142 --> 00:34:24.358]  I mean, it covers the latest police state developments, the sound cannons, the hover blimps, the police just savagely threatening to arrest members of the media who have congressional press passes that can get you ten feet from the president, but don't interview an old lady at ground zero because we're the cops, and you're scum, and you're going to learn to worship us.
[00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.061]  That's the first, you know, 35 minutes or so.
[00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:32.965]  Then we spend over an hour on confronting Michael Moore for doing a whitewash on 9-11.
[00:34:33.406 --> 00:34:34.507]  We spent about ten minutes on that.
[00:34:34.567 --> 00:34:42.854]  But over an hour on 9-11 itself, what the globalists did, how they executed the attacks, how the supposed hijackers were decoys.
[00:34:44.116 --> 00:34:58.629]  Then we look at the history of the elite, the Nazi connections, the connections to the occult, Bohemian Grove, and to really show you their mentality, why they're so into death and destruction, why they're so ruthless, why they're different than most people.
[00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.273]  It's so important to get this new film, Martial Law.
[00:35:03.974 --> 00:35:09.959]  And there's other great videos, like Aaron Zellman's JPFO, Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownerships video.
[00:35:11.135 --> 00:35:12.596]  And on VHS and DVD.
[00:35:12.636 --> 00:35:15.718]  And you get three free color bucklets with it when you order one.
[00:35:15.738 --> 00:35:21.300]  The Grandpa Jack series comic book form for adults and children about the history of the Second Amendment.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.461]  Really wakes people up.
[00:35:22.781 --> 00:35:26.503]  Three comic books and when you order the DVD or VHS.
[00:35:28.964 --> 00:35:32.566]  Innocence Betrayed is the history of gun control.
[00:35:32.606 --> 00:35:37.028]  How every time they take the guns or they register the guns, then they take them, then they kill you.
[00:35:37.428 --> 00:35:38.189]  Then they enslave you.
[00:35:38.209 --> 00:35:39.129]  Then they rape your wife.
[00:35:39.827 --> 00:35:41.127]  I mean, this is just the way it works.
[00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:45.228]  The government takes your guns, hires criminals out of the prisons, and enslaves you.
[00:35:45.408 --> 00:35:46.129]  And now it's happening.
[00:35:47.249 --> 00:35:48.829]  So you better get Innocence Betrayed.
[00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:58.992]  George Humphrey's great 9-11 DVD that I don't think gets enough attention, that we carry, that also comes with a free color booklet, 90-something page book.
[00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:02.790]  9-11 The Great Illusion booklet.
[00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.073]  Then there's 9-11 The Great Illusion DVD or VHS.
[00:36:06.513 --> 00:36:10.177]  Two-hour film, just amazing information, all about 9-11.
[00:36:11.578 --> 00:36:12.519]  Great film to get.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.943]  And then we also, of course, have my classic 9-11 film, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny.
[00:36:17.283 --> 00:36:21.968]  Then there's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, where I infiltrated the satanic encampment.
[00:36:22.718 --> 00:36:27.199]  Where George Bush admittedly goes, you're Christian conservatives doing a mock human sacrifice.
[00:36:28.299 --> 00:36:39.941]  Since I snuck in there five years ago, people couldn't believe it, but now it's been in Wall Street Journal, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, even National Geographic last year.
[00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:42.942]  Oh, here's a photo of the mock sacrifice they released to us.
[00:36:43.462 --> 00:36:44.962]  See, they're just throwing it in your face.
[00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:46.082]  Oh, it's so Christian.
[00:36:46.382 --> 00:36:47.743]  It's of the Lord.
[00:36:48.443 --> 00:36:49.723]  You need to get...
[00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:52.667]  Dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:36:53.847 --> 00:36:55.588]  Here is the toll-free number.
[00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:59.990]  The toll-free number to order this video.
[00:37:01.371 --> 00:37:02.951]  Or any of the videos that we've mentioned.
[00:37:04.946 --> 00:37:06.027]  A little bit dingy, folks.
[00:37:06.208 --> 00:37:07.670]  I had three hours sleep last night.
[00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.771]  I was on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:09.352]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:09.392 --> 00:37:10.453]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:38:01.943 --> 00:38:10.487]  And do not forget PrisonPlanet.tv, my weekly TV reports, all my documentary films, dozens of other films, we've been authorized to post.
[00:38:10.587 --> 00:38:13.608]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books.
[00:38:15.012 --> 00:38:17.193]  All of my best audio interviews from the show.
[00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:21.755]  Special video reports that aren't even on the TV show are on the website.
[00:38:22.335 --> 00:38:23.456]  Old archive shows.
[00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:25.056]  We've been putting more and more TV shows.
[00:38:25.096 --> 00:38:27.217]  I did four, five, six, seven, eight, nine years ago.
[00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:31.399]  Special reports nobody's ever seen outside Austin are being uploaded to the site.
[00:38:31.419 --> 00:38:33.240]  We're going to be doing a lot more on that site.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.982]  It just takes computers and employees and people to upload it and do it all.
[00:38:38.002 --> 00:38:38.642]  I mean, it's just...
[00:38:40.075 --> 00:38:41.616]  But we're doing it.
[00:38:41.656 --> 00:38:43.037]  It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:38:43.137 --> 00:38:44.877]  The more you support us, the more we can add to it.
[00:38:45.358 --> 00:38:46.598]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:46.698 --> 00:38:48.439]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:50.680]  All right, that is enough.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.482]  Let's go to Charles in Louisiana, who's been giving us great reportage.
[00:38:57.303 --> 00:39:00.284]  Charles, give us the report now.
[00:39:00.624 --> 00:39:05.406]  Well, they're saying there's tens of thousands of bodies, and the news media's trying to play it down.
[00:39:06.169 --> 00:39:06.289]  Oh, 53.
[00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:11.035]  But they found 27 bodies bunched together in one spot.
[00:39:12.117 --> 00:39:13.759]  There's bodies still floating in the street.
[00:39:14.139 --> 00:39:17.183]  They got different people taking the bodies, so we're never going to get the count right.
[00:39:18.543 --> 00:39:20.384]  Well, that's how it works with Iraq.
[00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:22.904]  We know the real numbers are over 8,000 dead.
[00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:23.564]  That's official.
[00:39:23.844 --> 00:39:26.865]  That's in foreign German and Dutch and British newspapers.
[00:39:26.925 --> 00:39:29.046]  It's even been in government reports here.
[00:39:29.506 --> 00:39:30.366]  So it's the same thing.
[00:39:30.426 --> 00:39:39.948]  But by breaking it all up and having the bodies brought in secretly and not counting it as a death if the person died after being evac'd out, they say it's at 2,000.
[00:39:39.988 --> 00:39:41.069]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:44.249]  Have you heard anything about what's happening in Iraq?
[00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:46.430]  The boys from Louisiana, Mississippi...
[00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:52.674]  Well, they're killing them big kids up there, and they want to come home and protect their family, and they're having a lot of disorder up there.
[00:40:07.865 --> 00:40:10.027]  Another guy from Louisiana got killed yesterday.
[00:40:10.387 --> 00:40:11.608]  But anyway, I wanted to ask you this.
[00:40:11.808 --> 00:40:17.813]  Have you heard Barbara Bush, once she went down to Texas with Clinton, her son Clinton?
[00:40:18.294 --> 00:40:23.037]  She said they've got it quite well and that they're lucky and it's just wonderful.
[00:40:23.278 --> 00:40:31.965]  The camera was still on when she walked off and she told, I think it was her husband, no matter where you send these people, how much money you get them, they're non-functional.
[00:40:32.205 --> 00:40:32.805]  Did you hear that?
[00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:34.907]  It was a reporter on Judge Raleigh.
[00:40:35.527 --> 00:40:36.088]  Yes, I did.
[00:40:36.647 --> 00:40:40.609]  Okay, another thing is this ATF, they ought to see this.
[00:40:40.649 --> 00:40:45.592]  They weren't running around with their hairdos and just prima donnas.
[00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:49.294]  I don't even know how they could portray themselves as policemen.
[00:40:50.773 --> 00:40:57.316]  They want to confiscate guns where people's got houses, report your guns, and they'll go into your house and get your guns.
[00:40:57.396 --> 00:40:58.917]  And they'll never give them back to you.
[00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:08.561]  No, no, they're openly slaggering around in their little Billy Bad Butt outfits, slaggering around like punks while women and children die.
[00:41:08.821 --> 00:41:09.521]  That's the truth.
[00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:10.862]  What you said is the truth.
[00:41:10.942 --> 00:41:14.143]  They're running around like punks, which they are.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.302]  And I tell you the truth, Mr. Jones, you would have a better chance of surviving in the middle of Angola than around them thugs.
[00:41:20.602 --> 00:41:22.623]  They're nothing but bootleggers, like you said.
[00:41:22.863 --> 00:41:23.823]  They are thugs.
[00:41:23.903 --> 00:41:25.304]  They're gangs.
[00:41:25.804 --> 00:41:26.524]  I'm telling you the truth.
[00:41:26.564 --> 00:41:30.926]  When the truth comes out about this here, when the truth gets out, I know you'll get the truth out.
[00:41:31.066 --> 00:41:35.568]  Well, we have reports that the feds are demanding pleasure from the women.
[00:41:35.788 --> 00:41:36.388]  Yes, yes.
[00:41:36.648 --> 00:41:38.169]  Oh, they get them up there.
[00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:38.509]  They put...
[00:41:39.729 --> 00:41:41.871]  They put dogs on people asking for water.
[00:41:42.151 --> 00:41:51.435]  Look, they're telling the rest of the nation... Listen, I have admitted reports that are back in the newspaper where people are trying to walk out and they just machine gun them.
[00:41:51.715 --> 00:41:53.576]  Oh, yes, I've heard these reports too.
[00:41:53.616 --> 00:41:54.637]  Five people on a bridge?
[00:41:55.037 --> 00:41:57.438]  I understand it was their own workers they shot.
[00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:04.182]  Why would five people on a bridge attack the military?
[00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:05.002]  It's impossible.
[00:42:05.262 --> 00:42:12.867]  Well, the report coming out is somebody fired a gun at an alligator or something, and then the feds flipped out and went to slaughter their own people.
[00:42:12.907 --> 00:42:16.349]  Well, that's like the helicopters come out of the water.
[00:42:16.369 --> 00:42:18.811]  Well, I mean, look, the wicked fleeeth when none pursue it.
[00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:25.796]  The feds and the police, not all of them, but they're constantly acting like they're under attack, they're in danger, we're all evil.
[00:42:26.236 --> 00:42:29.258]  They freak out and basically stampede themselves.
[00:42:29.678 --> 00:42:32.820]  You know what the number one cause of death for a SWAT team officer is?
[00:42:33.121 --> 00:42:34.341]  This is their own admission.
[00:42:35.482 --> 00:42:36.363]  Their own officer.
[00:42:36.623 --> 00:42:38.585]  Hey, don't worry about Alex Jones, folks.
[00:42:38.645 --> 00:42:39.847]  I don't want any harm against you.
[00:42:39.867 --> 00:42:41.268]  You ought to look in the mirror.
[00:42:42.149 --> 00:42:45.732]  Mr. Jones, do you think we'll ever straighten this up with these police officers?
[00:42:45.832 --> 00:42:47.974]  Do you think we'll ever get this stuff straight?
[00:42:49.896 --> 00:42:51.478]  This has really been a tragedy here.
[00:42:51.738 --> 00:42:52.499]  Well, let me say this.
[00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:54.241]  You've got some good police officers.
[00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:56.463]  You've got three parishes now confirmed.
[00:42:57.083 --> 00:43:11.213]  Where they caught FEMA cutting police lines and not letting water in, where the sheriffs have got armed men and are even getting posses of citizens together, checking IDs, not letting FEMA in, guarding the... Well, our parish understands that.
[00:43:11.233 --> 00:43:19.979]  That's why they're not taking them all, because when you take them, the ATF comes with them, and they want to start running things, so we ain't taking them all.
[00:43:20.359 --> 00:43:22.861]  Oh, listen, I've got a little dog that was rescued.
[00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:25.503]  If somebody from Louisiana wants it, I'll give you my phone number.
[00:43:25.843 --> 00:43:28.606]  It's about five pounds, a little black dog, kind of long hair.
[00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:29.807]  It is precious.
[00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:33.992]  If somebody wants it, I've got five dogs here.
[00:43:34.312 --> 00:43:35.173]  I can't take no more.
[00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:37.612]  They're all leaving the dogs.
[00:43:37.912 --> 00:43:40.152]  Please, I hope my wife isn't listening right now.
[00:43:40.212 --> 00:43:43.433]  She is so precious, but she's a little female, and she is so lovable.
[00:43:43.793 --> 00:43:45.934]  So thankful to be out of that, you know?
[00:43:46.134 --> 00:43:47.314]  Have you given her a name yet?
[00:43:47.674 --> 00:43:50.795]  No, I've got five dogs here, Mr. Jones.
[00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:51.856]  I can't take no more.
[00:43:52.136 --> 00:43:54.636]  Well, we'll call her Sweetie Pie.
[00:43:54.656 --> 00:43:57.317]  Do you want somebody to call you if they live nearby?
[00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.178]  Oh, God, yes.
[00:43:58.238 --> 00:43:59.338]  I've got five dogs here.
[00:43:59.498 --> 00:44:00.718]  Well, tell folks where you live.
[00:44:01.078 --> 00:44:03.119]  I live in Walker, Louisiana, on K Market.
[00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:05.990]  Walker, Louisiana on K Market.
[00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.311]  If you have anybody around here about Charles, they know who I am.
[00:44:08.531 --> 00:44:10.593]  Well, do you want to give them your number?
[00:44:10.913 --> 00:44:12.394]  It's 791-7605.
[00:44:12.554 --> 00:44:15.856]  Give it again.
[00:44:15.876 --> 00:44:16.256]  791-7605.
[00:44:16.296 --> 00:44:18.837]  She'd make a good dog.
[00:44:18.877 --> 00:44:20.118]  She is so lovable.
[00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.819]  She's just happy to be away from that right now.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.900]  I just can't afford it.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.323]  My checks have been cut out from New Orleans to get my retirement check.
[00:44:29.783 --> 00:44:30.904]  I don't know how we're going to do it.
[00:44:30.944 --> 00:44:32.445]  We've got a home now, you know?
[00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:36.427]  We're going to be all right, but we did everything we could for the victims.
[00:44:37.147 --> 00:44:38.148]  But I'm telling you the truth.
[00:44:38.749 --> 00:44:40.590]  The news media changed their whole story.
[00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.751]  It was really down on Bush.
[00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:42.692]  Bush, come down here.
[00:44:45.254 --> 00:44:47.656]  This news media is just as crooked as the police.
[00:44:48.717 --> 00:44:50.098]  They're just as crooked as the police.
[00:44:50.803 --> 00:44:53.845]  All right, well, Charles, keep checking in with us as things develop.
[00:44:54.165 --> 00:44:54.605]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:56.347]  God bless you for what you're doing, Mr. Jones.
[00:44:56.747 --> 00:44:58.928]  And everybody, please wake up and get these tapes.
[00:44:59.268 --> 00:45:00.809]  I mean, this could happen to Texas.
[00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:03.191]  This could happen to any of you, any state.
[00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:06.233]  Oh, I have no doubt the feds are going to nuke cities.
[00:45:06.353 --> 00:45:07.033]  Oh, yeah.
[00:45:07.073 --> 00:45:08.694]  Well, why are the people not buying the tapes?
[00:45:08.714 --> 00:45:09.635]  Can you answer me that?
[00:45:09.695 --> 00:45:10.956]  What is wrong with the people?
[00:45:11.336 --> 00:45:13.897]  I can't afford to put out the tapes no more right now.
[00:45:13.918 --> 00:45:14.658]  I can't afford it.
[00:45:14.898 --> 00:45:18.740]  Somebody else is going to have to take off here from where I left off and start getting these tapes out.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.600]  Don't worry, Charles.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:19.960]  They are.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.761]  A lot of folks are doing good, and God bless you.
[00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:22.361]  I hope so, Mr. Jones.
[00:45:22.461 --> 00:45:24.342]  I'm so worried I'm not putting the tapes out.
[00:45:24.702 --> 00:45:26.443]  I feel so tired and sick.
[00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:27.223]  I'm just sick.
[00:45:27.263 --> 00:45:28.104]  I don't know if I got something.
[00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:29.705]  I'm just... My wife's tired.
[00:45:29.745 --> 00:45:30.305]  We're worried.
[00:45:30.325 --> 00:45:31.005]  How are we going to make it?
[00:45:31.025 --> 00:45:33.866]  You need to just relax and just put it all in God's hands.
[00:45:33.906 --> 00:45:34.467]  Just give it up.
[00:45:34.787 --> 00:45:35.867]  Turn it over to God.
[00:45:36.247 --> 00:45:37.068]  Take care, Charles.
[00:45:37.508 --> 00:45:44.291]  Charles has made over 6,000 copies of my videos and other videos there in Louisiana.
[00:45:45.248 --> 00:45:46.309]  Over the last five years.
[00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.732]  And he's a retired longshoreman, and you heard him.
[00:45:51.193 --> 00:45:55.757]  He can't make copies anymore because he doesn't have any money.
[00:45:56.938 --> 00:45:58.940]  He isn't even getting his retirement check.
[00:46:00.461 --> 00:46:03.664]  And now they're starting to admit this will affect the economy.
[00:46:04.244 --> 00:46:12.351]  Now the Treasury Secretary Snow, normally giving us a snow job, he told us how great it would be to have a valueless dollar a few years ago.
[00:46:12.411 --> 00:46:13.452]  Now we're learning that it's not good.
[00:46:14.483 --> 00:46:18.947]  And it is affecting the economy, and it's not good.
[00:46:19.007 --> 00:46:19.928]  Robert in Colorado.
[00:46:19.948 --> 00:46:20.568]  Go ahead, Robert.
[00:46:22.009 --> 00:46:22.570]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:23.370]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.911]  Appreciate it.
[00:46:23.971 --> 00:46:25.132]  Great show as always.
[00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:30.536]  On that order that the mayor of New Orleans gave, can he legally do that?
[00:46:30.596 --> 00:46:32.518]  I mean, physically force someone to leave their house?
[00:46:32.578 --> 00:46:33.619]  I didn't think he could do that.
[00:46:33.979 --> 00:46:38.463]  Well, you couldn't under common law in the Constitution, but under the new FEMA laws, which...
[00:46:39.247 --> 00:46:40.428]  Again, are totally illegitimate.
[00:46:40.948 --> 00:46:57.599]  They have tried to legitimize it and tried to train people, but no, you've... I mean, always under common law, you have the right, unless you are in imminent harm, say if a fire is rushing towards you, to stay there.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:04.644]  And I think because this government showed itself to be so inept, so criminal, so predatory, that...
[00:47:06.505 --> 00:47:08.186]  I mean, I wouldn't trust the government.
[00:47:08.286 --> 00:47:09.246]  I wouldn't go with FEMA.
[00:47:09.547 --> 00:47:16.470]  Look, the families aren't just not leaving because they are taking their dogs away from them and their cats.
[00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.691]  Also, they're breaking their children up.
[00:47:19.071 --> 00:47:21.012]  And I guarantee you, say this happened in Austin.
[00:47:21.923 --> 00:47:25.504]  And they were saying, I mean, I don't trust the government.
[00:47:25.764 --> 00:47:30.365]  And if I knew that there was room on those buses, and they just said, well, no, we're going to break your family up.
[00:47:30.385 --> 00:47:31.265]  You'll get the next bus.
[00:47:31.585 --> 00:47:32.845]  I wouldn't do it.
[00:47:33.485 --> 00:47:36.266]  Your child, the most dangerous place for your child.
[00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:38.667]  Now, this has even been on the cover of Time Magazine, folks.
[00:47:38.687 --> 00:47:40.827]  This is the federal numbers.
[00:47:40.887 --> 00:47:48.249]  Your child is five times in greater danger in government hands than in anybody else's.
[00:47:49.289 --> 00:47:50.389]  It is so dangerous.
[00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:51.482]  And... And...
[00:48:09.807 --> 00:48:12.168]  So, I mean, they can't help you.
[00:48:12.268 --> 00:48:13.269]  They won't help you.
[00:48:13.669 --> 00:48:19.433]  A lot of these government people are felons who like a badge and a gun so they can pull women over and rape them.
[00:48:19.853 --> 00:48:21.494]  You know, this is what they're up to.
[00:48:23.195 --> 00:48:35.142]  Yeah, I think one painful list that could be drawn from this past seven days is that clearly the government not only doesn't care about you, is unable to help you at all.
[00:48:35.182 --> 00:48:35.762]  You're on your own.
[00:48:36.466 --> 00:48:40.769]  The other thing, real quick, Alexander, you always talk about the Berkey water filters.
[00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:50.655]  I'm just wondering, would those still... I heard a quick story on, I think, the Internet, read on the Internet today about possible Ebola viruses getting in the water.
[00:48:50.895 --> 00:48:51.456]  Ebola?
[00:48:51.496 --> 00:48:52.796]  Yeah, Ebola.
[00:48:54.257 --> 00:48:55.338]  Ebola's in Africa.
[00:48:56.522 --> 00:48:57.563]  Not Ebola, I'm sorry.
[00:48:57.603 --> 00:48:58.183]  E. coli.
[00:48:58.583 --> 00:48:59.784]  E. coli, yeah, I'm sorry, thank you.
[00:48:59.944 --> 00:49:00.264]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:00.405 --> 00:49:00.805]  That's all right.
[00:49:00.825 --> 00:49:01.105]  E. coli.
[00:49:01.465 --> 00:49:04.687]  If that got into the water, would a Berkey be able to filter stuff like that out?
[00:49:04.747 --> 00:49:09.611]  Well, it is, sir, it is in the water, and it's already killed at least eight people.
[00:49:10.831 --> 00:49:15.775]  It killed five people yesterday, and they're not doing blood tests on most of them, so they don't even know how many have died.
[00:49:16.115 --> 00:49:19.197]  But just by happenstance, people are dying of E. coli left and right.
[00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.011]  I guarantee you, if they're telling you it's 8, it's probably 50 times that.
[00:49:24.171 --> 00:49:27.452]  Because, you know, reporting is so low compared to actual incidences.
[00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:40.056]  And, oh, yeah, I mean, all those septic tanks, all those sewers, all that animal waste, eight, nine days of humans defecating everywhere, animals defecating.
[00:49:40.896 --> 00:49:43.156]  It is a nightmare in the 80% underwater.
[00:49:43.177 --> 00:49:47.738]  The areas that aren't underwater aren't in that great of danger as long as they get fresh food and water into them.
[00:49:47.758 --> 00:49:48.238]  And, yes, sir.
[00:49:48.866 --> 00:49:52.907]  The Berkey, the British Berkey and the American Berkey that we promote.
[00:49:52.967 --> 00:49:54.528]  Notice we haven't been plugging it this week.
[00:49:54.548 --> 00:49:55.088]  We should have.
[00:49:56.908 --> 00:50:02.010]  A new standard, the black Berkey element, takes it to non-detectable levels.
[00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:10.732]  And the funny thing is the University of Louisiana did the... It was one of the universities that he had do the test on the British Berkey versus the black Berkey.
[00:50:10.752 --> 00:50:11.712]  The British Berkey is incredible.
[00:50:11.992 --> 00:50:12.893]  We also sell those.
[00:50:13.653 --> 00:50:13.793]  But...
[00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:17.406]  The black Berkey, non-detectable.
[00:50:17.506 --> 00:50:20.267]  They dump green lawn growth.
[00:50:20.407 --> 00:50:22.968]  Lawn growth is actual P3 dish green water.
[00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:24.249]  Slime water.
[00:50:25.429 --> 00:50:26.350]  Into the test Berkey.
[00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.390]  Not the Berkey you buy, folks.
[00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:28.171]  It's sterile.
[00:50:28.751 --> 00:50:29.631]  They pour it in.
[00:50:30.251 --> 00:50:31.512]  It goes through the filters.
[00:50:32.232 --> 00:50:39.855]  They put it in an electron microscope a week later, giving bacteria time to grow, on the water that was filtered, and nothing can be found.
[00:50:40.336 --> 00:50:41.336]  A new standard.
[00:50:42.003 --> 00:50:42.263]  Wow.
[00:50:42.744 --> 00:50:44.905]  Even reverse osmosis isn't 100%.
[00:50:45.265 --> 00:50:47.467]  This is a new standard.
[00:50:48.027 --> 00:50:51.970]  So, yes, sir, these gravity filters are the way to go.
[00:50:52.511 --> 00:50:54.532]  They will make that water 100% delicious and safe.
[00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:09.910]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:14.937]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.157 --> 00:51:20.804]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:21.024 --> 00:51:25.551]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:32.942]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.962 --> 00:51:36.527]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:51:37.647 --> 00:51:40.148]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:47.129]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:52.590]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.010]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:08.968]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.248 --> 00:52:20.159]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.299 --> 00:52:20.699]  We're good to go.
[00:52:36.909 --> 00:52:37.409]  That's right.
[00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:44.711]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:53.734]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.794 --> 00:52:54.254]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.444 --> 00:53:09.388]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.629 --> 00:53:11.870]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:18.415]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.755 --> 00:53:19.416]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:39.608]  We're good to go.
[00:54:02.196 --> 00:54:04.937]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:04.957 --> 00:54:08.859]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.301]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:13.682 --> 00:54:21.245]  Tim, Jason, Nathan, Rick, your calls are all coming up.
[00:54:22.446 --> 00:54:24.707]  There's so many facets to this unfolding disaster.
[00:54:24.727 --> 00:54:26.728]  I also want to get into the Supreme Court situation.
[00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:30.210]  What's happening with the free trade area of the Americas, all of it.
[00:54:30.996 --> 00:54:39.419]  But because Robert in Denver brought up the big Berkeys, I should get Debbie on to talk about it, especially during this disaster.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:48.623]  There are a lot of different filters out there, but a charcoal-style filter that you buy, say, at Home Depot or something, I've read the specs.
[00:54:48.883 --> 00:54:49.563]  I don't use those.
[00:54:50.103 --> 00:54:52.184]  They just cut out bad flavor, bad taste.
[00:54:52.944 --> 00:54:54.465]  They just clean out a little bit of stuff.
[00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:56.285]  That's why they're $50 instead of $250.
[00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:02.864]  Reverse osmosis is very good, but you can't haul that around in the field.
[00:55:03.304 --> 00:55:05.506]  And still, reverse osmosis isn't 100%.
[00:55:06.447 --> 00:55:10.551]  Sometimes some of the particles get through that diaphragm, but it's still almost 100%.
[00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:20.440]  And then you've got, well, the Thames River was so polluted, Queen Elizabeth gave an award to British Berkey.
[00:55:20.947 --> 00:55:22.668]  150-something years ago.
[00:55:23.168 --> 00:55:23.708]  More than that.
[00:55:23.768 --> 00:55:25.909]  She gave a big award because she was getting sick.
[00:55:25.969 --> 00:55:26.589]  She was sickly.
[00:55:26.649 --> 00:55:27.309]  Everybody was sick.
[00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.090]  They were drinking that water out of the river.
[00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:38.634]  And the scientists came up with a way to have these porous ceramics because you notice that limestone, the dirty water could go down through an aquifer and come out clean on the other side.
[00:55:39.731 --> 00:55:43.733]  And, of course, since the hundreds of years, it's gotten better and better and better.
[00:55:44.313 --> 00:55:56.199]  And when you've got Dutch or British missionaries in Africa or wherever, they take the stainless steel little British Berkeys with them because they're very tough, very compact, very simple to use.
[00:55:56.399 --> 00:56:00.681]  And, I mean, they cut out all the bacteria.
[00:56:00.761 --> 00:56:08.785]  The black Berkeys, an American upgrade of the British design, even cuts out things even smaller.
[00:56:08.985 --> 00:56:09.185]  Now,
[00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:11.995]  A Chinese or Indian knockoff is $300.
[00:56:12.896 --> 00:56:13.677]  Totally worthless.
[00:56:13.897 --> 00:56:14.377]  That's not true.
[00:56:14.837 --> 00:56:19.121]  They cut out a lot of stuff, pretty much make it safe, but nothing near an American or British Berkey.
[00:56:20.442 --> 00:56:25.925]  But the little sports bottles, though, that they make in America and sell have a big element.
[00:56:26.486 --> 00:56:31.730]  And they'll cut out all your E. coli and problems and make it safe to drink.
[00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.972]  They will not cut out all the chemicals because they're so small.
[00:56:35.272 --> 00:56:36.273]  They will reduce them.
[00:56:36.953 --> 00:56:38.074]  Those things are, what, $25 a piece.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:47.604]  And the brand that New Millennium sells has got a big element in the sports box.
[00:56:47.624 --> 00:56:52.906]  A lot of these units you see sold have a tiny little element, and those aren't as good.
[00:56:53.927 --> 00:56:59.489]  But, I don't know, it's over 25% off when you tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:00.810]  I mean, a $300 filter is $225.
[00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.530]  A $35 filter is $25.
[00:57:08.548 --> 00:57:10.890]  And it makes our international shortwave outreach possible.
[00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:11.810]  We really appreciate them.
[00:57:12.231 --> 00:57:14.332]  And it's a great product, and I suggest you get it.
[00:57:14.592 --> 00:57:14.952]  But you know what?
[00:57:15.252 --> 00:57:17.714]  I don't drink out of a Big Berkey because I'm worried about a disaster.
[00:57:19.855 --> 00:57:21.076]  The disaster's already happened.
[00:57:21.476 --> 00:57:25.078]  The poisons that are in our water already are the creeping death.
[00:57:26.159 --> 00:57:27.880]  And so your water just tastes so much better.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.221]  And why would you let your children drink tap water?
[00:57:30.979 --> 00:57:31.740]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.161]  Give New Millennium a call.
[00:57:33.421 --> 00:57:40.587]  I wasn't going to plug this, but he brought it up.
[00:57:40.607 --> 00:57:41.367]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:57:41.387 --> 00:57:41.868]  888-803-4438.
[00:57:42.428 --> 00:57:50.234]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com and tell them what free gift you want in the comments section, and it's an Alex Jones special to get those discounts.
[00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:52.035]  BerkeyWater.com or 888-803-4438.
[00:57:52.055 --> 00:57:54.277]  Or you can also order the filters off InfoWars.com.
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:05.526]  In the comments section, say you want a free sports bottle or the video, sheltering in place for what you want, and we'll get that out to you.
[00:58:05.926 --> 00:58:10.410]  So InfoWars.com or 888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com.
[00:58:10.951 --> 00:58:11.351]  All right.
[00:58:11.371 --> 00:58:14.134]  We're going to come back and go to your calls.
[00:58:14.194 --> 00:58:17.577]  Kim, Jason, Nathan, Rick, and others.
[00:58:18.778 --> 00:58:20.199]  Got some guests coming in later as well.
[00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:20.319]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:20.359 --> 00:58:20.940]  Straight to your calls.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.561]  Straight to your calls when we get back.
[00:58:26.212 --> 00:58:30.073]  And we'll talk about whatever issues you want to talk about, anything you want to discuss.
[00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:36.095]  And again, I want to thank all of our affiliates, all of our sponsors, the great folks that make the broadcast possible at Genesis.
[00:58:37.116 --> 00:58:38.436]  My producers, just everybody.
[00:58:38.456 --> 00:58:38.976]  God bless you.
[00:58:41.597 --> 00:58:45.499]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:46.619]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.639 --> 00:58:46.799]  Hello!
[00:58:58.058 --> 00:58:58.698]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.379 --> 00:59:00.419]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.139 --> 00:59:02.340]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.721]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:05.381]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.062 --> 00:59:09.884]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.224 --> 00:59:14.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.027 --> 00:59:19.308]  Well, FEMA has been caught.
[00:59:19.368 --> 00:59:20.969]  We're going to go over this laundry list.
[00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:26.401]  Sabotaging key facilities all over Louisiana and even into other states.
[00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:33.725]  The police are guarding against them, saying that they're sabotaging things and are having to post armed guards against FEMA sabotaging.
[00:59:34.706 --> 00:59:36.347]  That's their job, create a bigger crisis.
[00:59:36.387 --> 00:59:39.969]  They get more funding, more control, more power, train us to accept martial law.
[00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:45.693]  The mayor's saying he's going to send the feds in with armed troops and police to make everybody leave the city.
[00:59:46.638 --> 00:59:49.680]  They're breaking up families, taking family pets.
[00:59:50.221 --> 00:59:52.663]  That is important compared to breaking up families.
[00:59:52.683 --> 00:59:54.264]  It's just horrible.
[00:59:54.344 --> 00:59:55.565]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:59:56.065 --> 00:59:57.607]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:59:57.667 --> 00:59:58.267]  Welcome, Tim.
[00:59:58.687 --> 00:59:59.768]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:59:59.788 --> 01:00:00.309]  Hi.
[01:00:00.609 --> 01:00:01.750]  You are going to love this one.
[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:07.934]  Yesterday, I was threatened with arrest by a female Navy recruiter.
[01:00:10.597 --> 01:00:14.880]  I was going to a building that holds several businesses, including four
[01:00:15.758 --> 01:00:17.059]  Of the services recruiting.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.523]  And I think just listening to you and being hip to all your films and that, I'm getting bold in my old age.
[01:00:22.543 --> 01:00:27.887]  Because as I was going into the building, there was a young black man coming out with this Navy recruiter.
[01:00:28.687 --> 01:00:31.129]  And I just looked the kid in the eye and I said, don't do it, man.
[01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:33.051]  He's nothing but a pimp for the globalists.
[01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:35.052]  And I pointed to him with my index finger, right?
[01:00:36.313 --> 01:00:40.656]  Next thing I know, I'm up in the office where I was going.
[01:00:41.266 --> 01:00:47.952]  And there's like a big window in between the door, a door in between two... Oh, yeah, a lot of these troops can't wait to start arresting American citizens.
[01:00:48.172 --> 01:00:49.413]  They tracked me down.
[01:00:49.473 --> 01:00:55.718]  I felt like Rowdy Roddy Piper in the movie They Live, you know, in the scene where she goes, I got one that can see.
[01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.860]  Boy, I'd love it if troops tried that with me.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:58.941]  She came in there.
[01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:02.483]  Well, first of all, I was on the phone, and they were standing out in the hallway with this one guy.
[01:01:02.824 --> 01:01:06.507]  And then this other woman joined them, both in the Navy suits.
[01:01:07.087 --> 01:01:09.069]  And they actually came in to this other office.
[01:01:09.525 --> 01:01:11.406]  And I was on making a phone call in the lobby.
[01:01:11.746 --> 01:01:12.927]  That's totally criminal.
[01:01:12.947 --> 01:01:14.808]  You need to file complaints on them immediately.
[01:01:14.828 --> 01:01:16.168]  Who do I file complaints with?
[01:01:16.188 --> 01:01:17.489]  You need to call the media.
[01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:19.830]  I mean, look, number one, recruiters have been caught.
[01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.231]  I'm sure you've heard about this nationwide.
[01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:25.993]  Telling kids that if they don't sign on the dotted line, they're going to jail, which is extortion.
[01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:27.634]  They've been caught lying.
[01:01:27.674 --> 01:01:29.174]  They've been caught intimidating.
[01:01:29.194 --> 01:01:31.656]  They've been caught harassing in the schools.
[01:01:31.696 --> 01:01:35.397]  And you have every right to warn people not to be involved with these people.
[01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:38.359]  And you need to call...
[01:01:39.744 --> 01:01:43.687]  You need to call the head office for recruiters.
[01:01:44.047 --> 01:01:54.334]  You need to write the story up in an email format, send it to me to give it some traction, and you need to go take photos of the recruiting offices and attach that in the email.
[01:01:54.354 --> 01:01:54.994]  You don't know how.
[01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:56.295]  Get somebody to for you.
[01:01:56.715 --> 01:01:57.956]  You need to first expose them.
[01:01:58.457 --> 01:02:03.460]  Then you need to complain about it, and you need to call the police and file a report.
[01:02:05.381 --> 01:02:06.262]  Did they detain you?
[01:02:06.302 --> 01:02:07.903]  Did they act like they were in control?
[01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:11.141]  Well, that's false arrest if they did.
[01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:13.283]  I mean, you've got them.
[01:02:13.783 --> 01:02:17.367]  And even if they don't get in trouble, it's important to let them know.
[01:02:17.587 --> 01:02:20.470]  They were both standing across from me, arms crossed.
[01:02:20.851 --> 01:02:24.214]  And this one guy, I could see him seething under his breath.
[01:02:24.254 --> 01:02:29.359]  He's like, you've got to get out of this country.
[01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:30.941]  I thought you said they threatened you with arrest.
[01:02:31.061 --> 01:02:31.501]  Well, they did.
[01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:34.905]  She came up and she told me that... They need to get out of this.
[01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:37.807]  You know, George Washington was a prominent redcoat.
[01:02:37.867 --> 01:02:44.774]  George Washington, you know, was a Billy, you know, bad, you know, rear-end, you know, Billy Badbutt, to use the term.
[01:02:46.515 --> 01:02:47.516]  And what did he do?
[01:02:47.756 --> 01:02:49.558]  You know, he took the redcoat off and he put a...
[01:02:50.146 --> 01:02:53.008]  Blue went on because he was tired of stuff just like that.
[01:02:53.289 --> 01:02:54.229]  They need to leave.
[01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:56.011]  So what else do these punks do?
[01:02:56.351 --> 01:02:59.954]  Well, they stood on either side in front of me with their arms crossed.
[01:02:59.994 --> 01:03:02.556]  I said, and this guy's seat, and he's telling me... Tell him, get out of my face!
[01:03:02.596 --> 01:03:03.136]  And that's what I said.
[01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:04.497]  I said, why don't you get out of this country?
[01:03:04.517 --> 01:03:06.459]  And I said, well, why don't you get out of this country?
[01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:12.121]  And then the lady's saying, what I did is a Class C felony, and if I do it again, I'm going to call the police.
[01:03:12.141 --> 01:03:13.282]  And I go, call the police?
[01:03:13.382 --> 01:03:14.582]  I'm not a bootlicker.
[01:03:14.602 --> 01:03:18.503]  Yeah, that's what criminals always do, is they threaten, they intimidate.
[01:03:18.864 --> 01:03:22.045]  And if I did commit a Class C felony, why would she hesitate?
[01:03:22.085 --> 01:03:23.505]  Why would you give me a second chance?
[01:03:24.706 --> 01:03:27.347]  It's a whole bunch... No, it's all color of law.
[01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:28.487]  I have her name and her number.
[01:03:28.547 --> 01:03:29.828]  Maybe we could call her up and ask her.
[01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:31.288]  You know what?
[01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.009]  You need to put it in an article format.
[01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.949]  All right.
[01:03:33.989 --> 01:03:34.329]  Stay there.
[01:03:34.369 --> 01:03:35.310]  I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:35.770]  I don't want to...
[01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:38.452]  I tell you, this is outrageous.
[01:03:38.492 --> 01:03:39.332]  Maybe I'll give them a call.
[01:03:40.173 --> 01:03:43.356]  But I want to hear how you dealt with them.
[01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:48.481]  Folks, America isn't about troops cornering you.
[01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:49.842]  You understand that's not freedom?
[01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:57.762]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.022 --> 01:03:59.603]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.943 --> 01:04:04.625]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.965 --> 01:04:09.387]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.807 --> 01:04:14.009]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:17.050]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:21.792]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.012 --> 01:04:26.435]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:33.861]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:01.185]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:05.448]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:06:05.688 --> 01:06:07.849]  It's a patented nail gel called non-X.
[01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.891]  All-natural non-X clears out the...
[01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:15.215]  The dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:06:15.535 --> 01:06:18.137]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:06:18.418 --> 01:06:21.940]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:30.067]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:31.968]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:06:32.248 --> 01:06:34.710]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X,
[01:06:36.031 --> 01:06:44.153]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.934]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[01:06:47.334 --> 01:06:52.716]  Nonex Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:06:53.936 --> 01:06:59.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.358 --> 01:07:04.719]  In Denver, Colorado, in Houston, Texas,
[01:07:06.758 --> 01:07:10.659]  In Boise, Idaho, we have reports all over the nation.
[01:07:13.881 --> 01:07:34.268]  We've even got, we even have, you know, audio tape interviews and military caught on video where recruiters go into the schools and intimidate and track children, 15, 16, 17, 18, and then they finally tell them, you sign on the dotted line,
[01:07:35.026 --> 01:07:40.609]  You sign on to join the Marines, the Navy, and the Army, or we're going to arrest you right now.
[01:07:41.629 --> 01:07:47.432]  So they've been told by the Pentagon to go around saying that basically threatening arrests.
[01:07:47.452 --> 01:07:48.192]  This is what they do.
[01:07:48.893 --> 01:07:55.696]  And Tim, who I remember he calls it a lot, he called originally eight months ago about the recruiter threatening to arrest people.
[01:07:56.408 --> 01:07:56.909]  We're good to go.
[01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:57.630]  We're good to go.
[01:08:08.226 --> 01:08:14.191]  I saw the Navy recruiter walking out with this young kid, and Tim said, hey, don't do it.
[01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:16.313]  You're going to get scammed, basically, and went inside.
[01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:23.980]  Then the recruiters come and follow him up in the real estate office and start threatening to arrest him and grinding their teeth and saying, leave the country.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.484]  Finish up with what you said to them at the Lauren, Ohio, Navy recruiting office.
[01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:30.605]  Lorraine, Lorraine, Ohio.
[01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:31.306]  Lorraine.
[01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:33.748]  Yeah, and in their defense, I did...
[01:08:34.301 --> 01:08:36.622]  Point to him and say he was a pimp for the globalists.
[01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:39.463]  Well, that's your free speech right.
[01:08:39.523 --> 01:08:41.803]  If he doesn't like it, he needs to leave this country.
[01:08:42.323 --> 01:08:45.264]  Being patriotic doesn't mean worshipping the government.
[01:08:45.484 --> 01:08:47.925]  Being patriotic means standing up for the First Amendment.
[01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:56.848]  She said that pointing at him was a threatening gesture and that I was committing a class C felony.
[01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.430]  And that if I did it again, I was going to be arrested.
[01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:01.831]  And I'm just telling them, look, I'm not a bootlicker.
[01:09:02.132 --> 01:09:03.192]  Get out of my face.
[01:09:03.232 --> 01:09:06.414]  What they were doing is they were trying to get you to say something threatening.
[01:09:06.554 --> 01:09:06.794]  Right.
[01:09:07.174 --> 01:09:07.595]  Exactly.
[01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:11.517]  Good thing you had witnesses or they would have probably done something worse.
[01:09:12.818 --> 01:09:16.179]  Now, this is the Lorain, Ohio, Navy Recruiting Office.
[01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:16.520]  Yeah.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:24.724]  And, you know, it's just shameful, folks, shameful that this type of stuff is going on.
[01:09:24.804 --> 01:09:26.205]  So what happened when you stood up to them?
[01:09:27.301 --> 01:09:32.790]  Well, I said, first they just came into the office and they're standing there and they're staring at me.
[01:09:33.151 --> 01:09:33.832]  And I'm on the phone.
[01:09:34.473 --> 01:09:37.137]  And I was facing them and I had to go on hold on my call.
[01:09:37.538 --> 01:09:38.199]  And I dropped it down.
[01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:39.161]  I'm like, you know, what's your problem?
[01:09:39.727 --> 01:09:41.528]  He's like, you're my problem, blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:42.788]  He said, why don't you get out of this country?
[01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:43.669]  You're Al Qaeda!
[01:09:43.769 --> 01:09:45.029]  Yeah, why don't you get out of this country?
[01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:46.190]  And he's just seething.
[01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:48.311]  And I could tell that the dude just wanted to rip my head off.
[01:09:48.451 --> 01:09:51.653]  Because, I mean, he doesn't have to go breathe to you.
[01:09:51.713 --> 01:09:53.874]  He doesn't have to get all the vaccinations.
[01:09:53.954 --> 01:09:57.015]  He gets to lay around as long as they rope in a few kids a month.
[01:09:57.055 --> 01:10:00.757]  And I just explained to him that he doesn't know the truth about this country and what's really going on.
[01:10:01.861 --> 01:10:09.803]  Right now, I'm burning copies of Martial Law and Total Enslavement, and I got all the copies of Thomas Kelt stuff, and I'm going to stop by... So what did he say in the end?
[01:10:09.863 --> 01:10:13.464]  In the end, they go, well, they just said, if you do it again, you know, we're going to have you arrested.
[01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.584]  And then they walked out of there.
[01:10:15.764 --> 01:10:22.926]  They said I was committing a Class C felony by exercising my rights of free speech in the United States of America.
[01:10:23.046 --> 01:10:26.447]  Well, they're teaching a lot of them that pointing is an Al-Qaeda attack.
[01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:26.987]  Right.
[01:10:27.287 --> 01:10:27.427]  And...
[01:10:28.243 --> 01:10:37.819]  But show me in the law where... Well, they tried to put seven Christians in 47 years in prison apiece for praying on the street corner, all of it caught by news cameras, kneeling and praying.
[01:10:38.139 --> 01:10:39.662]  They were being charged as terrorists.
[01:10:39.722 --> 01:10:42.426]  I mean, the government isn't playing games, folks.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.644]  And it was up in Ohio where that doctor called and complained too much to the VA.
[01:10:48.684 --> 01:10:54.468]  And then the Homeland Security said, well, he didn't threaten anybody, but calling too much is an act of terrorism.
[01:10:54.828 --> 01:10:56.549]  And so they arrested him and convicted him.
[01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:01.213]  So maybe we could just stick the listeners on and give out a number and have everybody call and ask why he's threatening.
[01:11:01.233 --> 01:11:01.953]  You know, I think it's pointless.
[01:11:01.973 --> 01:11:02.794]  I think it's pointless.
[01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:07.237]  The key is get your children out of public schools so these parasites can't feed on them.
[01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:11.400]  And just, you know, write an article about it and I'll post it.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.501]  Don't take pictures of the recruiting office.
[01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.243]  Write me an article about it.
[01:11:16.483 --> 01:11:19.806]  Email it to tips at infowars.com and we will post it.
[01:11:20.186 --> 01:11:20.606]  Very good.
[01:11:20.847 --> 01:11:21.467]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:22.508]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:22.828]  You bet.
[01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:24.769]  Yeah, it's just better to do it written word.
[01:11:24.809 --> 01:11:27.311]  That way a couple million people conservatively will read it.
[01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:32.635]  And then it's got a real chance of them at least not doing it to somebody else.
[01:11:34.576 --> 01:11:36.198]  Man, I tell you, I just...
[01:11:37.995 --> 01:11:39.216]  You don't like the military.
[01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:41.117]  You don't like America.
[01:11:42.357 --> 01:11:44.678]  Well, I don't like the borders being wide open.
[01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:46.759]  I don't like the government doubling in size.
[01:11:46.939 --> 01:11:50.761]  I don't like the fact the military's been trying to take our guns and put us in camps.
[01:11:51.862 --> 01:11:55.463]  And George Washington didn't like it either, and that's why he stood up against the Redcoats.
[01:11:56.204 --> 01:11:59.345]  Being patriotic means standing for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:12:00.286 --> 01:12:04.908]  It doesn't mean because a bunch of swaggering, pot-bellied, lazy people...
[01:12:05.606 --> 01:12:09.189]  Want to go around telling us there are gods that we have to lick their boots.
[01:12:10.129 --> 01:12:11.490]  The government is not my god.
[01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:12.551]  It will never be my god.
[01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:16.234]  Being patriotic isn't living in the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[01:12:16.955 --> 01:12:20.877]  Hitler said patriotism is worshipping me and worshipping the military.
[01:12:21.118 --> 01:12:24.500]  Why, you're against the troops if you don't let me feed them into a two-front meat grinder.
[01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:32.366]  If it's a bad war getting the troops killed, it isn't supporting them, supporting the government that's sending them there.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.942]  You stop the war and get the troops home so that they don't get fed in the meat grinder.
[01:12:38.823 --> 01:12:46.267]  It's just so... But again, a lot of really ignorant, shallow people at a primitive level just want to feel good.
[01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:57.398]  And it's just a real primitive way of, just everything's fine, and George Bush is of the Lord, and I support the troops, and just everything's fine.
[01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:03.480]  Well, I'm glad you support the army that's, again, 24% on the ground in Iraq, Latin American.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.160]  I'm glad you support our foreign army.
[01:13:06.981 --> 01:13:14.163]  It'd be like a Tory going, I love the splendid German Hessians, so what if they bayonet and kill Americans?
[01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.363]  I'm with the crowd.
[01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:18.932]  Well, you're going to the ash heaps of history, all of you.
[01:13:19.352 --> 01:13:20.393]  All of you trash.
[01:13:21.154 --> 01:13:21.674]  You know what?
[01:13:23.215 --> 01:13:25.156]  Most of the troops I've talked to agree with me.
[01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:27.958]  Your propaganda isn't working.
[01:13:28.018 --> 01:13:28.959]  It's already failed.
[01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:33.823]  Hillary's going to get us in if you're not for Bush.
[01:13:34.403 --> 01:13:37.545]  Hillary comes out and calls for a commission the same day Bush does.
[01:13:37.785 --> 01:13:41.708]  Bill Clinton's constantly vacationing with his family, the Bushes.
[01:13:42.188 --> 01:13:44.470]  They've been in MENA business together for decades.
[01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:45.711]  It's totally staged.
[01:13:46.986 --> 01:13:48.307]  Hillary wants a bigger war.
[01:13:48.587 --> 01:13:50.089]  Chuckie Schumer wants a bigger war.
[01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:52.450]  Chuckie Schumer wants to go into Iran now.
[01:13:53.591 --> 01:13:54.832]  So did John Kerry.
[01:13:56.334 --> 01:13:57.535]  And I'd tell Democrats that.
[01:13:57.575 --> 01:13:58.615]  They'd get a blank face.
[01:13:59.196 --> 01:14:02.559]  The Republicans are all, Darn Democrats are against the war.
[01:14:02.659 --> 01:14:03.840]  I hate John Kerry.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:04.600]  Well, don't worry.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.961]  John Kerry was for your war.
[01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:10.585]  They're all paid for by the same people.
[01:14:10.605 --> 01:14:12.006]  Do you like being conned?
[01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:13.647]  Do you like being manipulated?
[01:14:13.667 --> 01:14:15.409]  Do you like the government laughing at you?
[01:14:17.932 --> 01:14:21.198]  You know, I talk to neocons and I go, well, our government put Saddam into power.
[01:14:21.699 --> 01:14:23.202]  Our government told him to invade Iran.
[01:14:23.242 --> 01:14:24.764]  Our government told him to invade Kuwait.
[01:14:25.165 --> 01:14:26.828]  Our government conducted genocide against him.
[01:14:26.989 --> 01:14:28.331]  A million and a half died in 13 years.
[01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:34.474]  Now it's even worse, and our government wants balkanization.
[01:14:34.854 --> 01:14:41.202]  Our government is following an Israeli plan that's published, the Pentagon admits it, to balkanize the country and have it fall into civil war.
[01:14:41.522 --> 01:14:43.344]  That way it won't be a strong nation ever.
[01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:48.330]  They don't want an elected government that will actually be strong and rebuild Iraq, because they couldn't control that.
[01:14:48.711 --> 01:14:51.134]  They are succeeding by having it be a meat grinder.
[01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.414]  They're succeeding.
[01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:56.996]  Then they get to sell more weapons systems and be in the country longer and build permanent bases.
[01:14:57.576 --> 01:15:03.438]  Meanwhile, you're going to have hardened military bases with surrounding bedlam forever in Iraq.
[01:15:04.758 --> 01:15:06.619]  And the Pentagon says that's the plan.
[01:15:08.139 --> 01:15:10.360]  The Jerusalem Post says that's the plan.
[01:15:11.489 --> 01:15:14.351]  Uh, Rumsfeld and P2OG says that's the plan.
[01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:18.534]  I mean, that's a bunch of liberal propaganda.
[01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:22.597]  Dick Cheney didn't say they wanted to invade Iraq.
[01:15:22.877 --> 01:15:25.980]  That's a liberal lie by Richard Clark.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.703]  Well, Dick Cheney wrote it in September 20th of 2000.
[01:15:32.104 --> 01:15:34.766]  George Bush's biographer says Bush said that in 99.
[01:15:35.126 --> 01:15:37.728]  He's probably a commie, too.
[01:15:37.988 --> 01:15:39.089]  Oh, no, he supports Bush.
[01:15:40.862 --> 01:15:51.288]  I mean, it'd be like if I said my favorite color was green, and then somebody said Alex's favorite color is green, and you heard me say my favorite color was green, but then you just said it's all a lie.
[01:15:51.829 --> 01:15:52.989]  They don't like you.
[01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:55.311]  They don't like you.
[01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:58.673]  I mean, I listen to neocons on the radio, the callers.
[01:15:59.033 --> 01:16:02.555]  I talk to them on the street, and they're so stupid.
[01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.477]  They're so dumb.
[01:16:07.242 --> 01:16:09.063]  I mean, I watch you get taken to the cleaners.
[01:16:09.103 --> 01:16:10.664]  I watch our society get raped.
[01:16:11.205 --> 01:16:13.566]  I watch the globalists dismantling our country.
[01:16:14.127 --> 01:16:18.510]  And you're running around waving plastic Chinese-American flags, giggling, giddily.
[01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:20.631]  I mean, this isn't funny.
[01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:22.472]  This isn't funny at all.
[01:16:23.933 --> 01:16:27.416]  And, uh, I just like Governor Pataki.
[01:16:27.576 --> 01:16:28.656]  Well, he's anti-gun, you know.
[01:16:28.696 --> 01:16:29.817]  He's going up for gun manufacturers.
[01:16:30.097 --> 01:16:31.298]  Well, let him, Alex.
[01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:32.919]  We gotta give up a little bit.
[01:16:33.099 --> 01:16:34.380]  I like Bush.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.002]  I mean, you are the scum of the earth, you filth.
[01:16:37.944 --> 01:16:41.687]  My children and my grandchildren may not have the Second Amendment because of you, you filth.
[01:16:42.067 --> 01:16:43.368]  We know what the liberals are.
[01:16:43.568 --> 01:16:44.989]  It's you that opened the gates.
[01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:46.450]  It's you that are the traitors.
[01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:48.592]  Look in the mirror.
[01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:50.293]  You want to know what's killing America?
[01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:52.274]  You are cyanide to this country.
[01:16:53.355 --> 01:16:54.256]  Jason in Maryland.
[01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:54.936]  You're on the air.
[01:16:54.956 --> 01:16:55.317]  Welcome.
[01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:56.357]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:56.477 --> 01:16:56.818]  Thanks.
[01:16:57.578 --> 01:17:06.485]  This isn't what I called, but I was just watching CNN spin, and they showed the Army marching through New Orleans and...
[01:17:07.344 --> 01:17:13.208]  And then they showed one of the officers machine guns, which was empty.
[01:17:13.248 --> 01:17:14.168]  It had no clip in it.
[01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:21.212]  And they said that it was against the Constitution for the Army to participate in policing the citizens.
[01:17:21.272 --> 01:17:25.715]  And they said, so they're carrying weapons with no munitions.
[01:17:25.835 --> 01:17:28.397]  Well, you know, this demonstrates for everybody.
[01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.957]  So then they go, well, that's dumb.
[01:17:30.057 --> 01:17:30.918]  Let them help.
[01:17:31.338 --> 01:17:32.379]  That's ridiculous.
[01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:42.555]  They've had the National Guard there the whole time, but now the Marines are there, now the Army's there, and it does not violate posse commentatus.
[01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:47.998]  They just can't be engaged in law enforcement activities themselves.
[01:17:48.358 --> 01:17:54.781]  They can certainly defend themselves, and the Marines were kicking down doors in 1989, raiding gun dealers.
[01:17:55.121 --> 01:17:56.242]  I have it in Road to Tyranny.
[01:17:56.522 --> 01:17:58.723]  They've had secret programs for 15 years plus.
[01:18:01.305 --> 01:18:08.171]  And they know exactly what they're doing, and it is a total... Again, we need more power.
[01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:10.012]  FEMA needs total control.
[01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:11.834]  We just can't help the people.
[01:18:12.374 --> 01:18:14.496]  Meanwhile, they already have the power to do that.
[01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:17.618]  Then they claim they don't have the power and get even more power.
[01:18:17.638 --> 01:18:18.159]  Do you understand?
[01:18:18.812 --> 01:18:19.253]  I do.
[01:18:19.313 --> 01:18:20.554]  That was a side issue.
[01:18:20.594 --> 01:18:21.895]  I just thought it was worth mentioning.
[01:18:21.915 --> 01:18:23.656]  Well, what else do you want to add?
[01:18:23.716 --> 01:18:26.298]  Don't you talk about George Bush, bad boy!
[01:18:27.279 --> 01:18:31.823]  I don't care if there's video of him hugging Jeff Gannon and rubbing his fingers on the back of his neck.
[01:18:32.103 --> 01:18:33.765]  That's what men do to their friends.
[01:18:34.365 --> 01:18:38.368]  You bet you're some kind of commie, aren't you, boy?
[01:18:38.889 --> 01:18:43.673]  I tell you what, let's just hear what you got to say after this break.
[01:18:44.414 --> 01:18:45.035]  All right.
[01:18:45.557 --> 01:18:46.539]  All right, boy.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:48.424]  Stay there, Jason.
[01:18:48.845 --> 01:18:50.689]  I'll let you finish swinging back.
[01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:51.110]  All right.

[01:19:55.467 --> 01:19:56.509]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.829 --> 01:19:59.633]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.894 --> 01:20:04.060]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.322]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.622 --> 01:20:10.189]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:12.791]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:27.986]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:28.046 --> 01:20:35.093]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:20:43.618 --> 01:20:45.659]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:59.748 --> 01:21:04.819]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:11.798 --> 01:21:14.920]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.042]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:18.102 --> 01:21:21.624]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:23.685 --> 01:21:24.606]  Here is reality.
[01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:28.528]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:29.609 --> 01:21:33.271]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:34.032 --> 01:21:36.373]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:04.865]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[01:22:05.506 --> 01:22:14.814]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[01:22:16.212 --> 01:22:16.893]  I think we're good to go.

[01:23:00.243 --> 01:23:14.988]  I hear scumbag socialists all over talk radio saying that we should arrest anybody that criticizes the government, that you shouldn't have freedoms, that it's time to put people in camps, that criticizing the government is evil.
[01:23:15.389 --> 01:23:16.789]  I mean, that's so un-American.
[01:23:17.429 --> 01:23:21.591]  And these idiots hear that and go, yeah, that's good, that sounds like freedom to me.
[01:23:23.178 --> 01:23:27.123]  Let's go ahead and go back and let Jason and Marilyn finish up.
[01:23:27.143 --> 01:23:27.764]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:23:28.685 --> 01:23:31.768]  Alex, I wanted to get your opinion on this
[01:23:33.487 --> 01:23:45.553]  Conflux of horror that we have with Greenspan's crash prediction, the Chinese-Russian war games, which I believe are directed at the United States.
[01:23:45.613 --> 01:23:46.734]  Well, they admit they are.
[01:23:46.774 --> 01:23:46.974]  What?
[01:23:47.394 --> 01:23:58.040]  The Israeli Daniel Project and the suitcase dirty bomb sleeper cells, which are here thanks to George Bush's open-door amnesty policy.
[01:23:59.235 --> 01:24:03.298]  I mean, it all seems like everything's teetering on the brink of disaster.
[01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:06.401]  What do you think of all of these things coming to a head at once?
[01:24:06.461 --> 01:24:07.281]  What are they waiting on?
[01:24:08.202 --> 01:24:09.383]  Order out of chaos.
[01:24:09.723 --> 01:24:13.086]  They have to train us that sea troops are good.
[01:24:13.606 --> 01:24:16.929]  Milling machine guns, confiscating your guns is for your safety.
[01:24:17.769 --> 01:24:21.072]  New Orleans is just a dry run to demonstrate all this.
[01:24:21.552 --> 01:24:25.175]  The CFR and all these generals for years have been saying how it's going to happen.
[01:24:25.195 --> 01:24:26.156]  It's for your own good.
[01:24:26.176 --> 01:24:26.236]  And...
[01:24:28.519 --> 01:24:29.099]  We're good to go.
[01:24:29.159 --> 01:24:29.600]  I think?
[01:24:42.089 --> 01:24:43.431]  And order out of chaos.
[01:24:43.491 --> 01:24:52.179]  They need to create global calamities so the multinational corporations can then reorganize things even further and train the public to be slaves.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:59.166]  I guess my question is, are they waiting to pull the trigger on the stock market crash and the Daniel Project and the
[01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:12.293]  Well, I said they probably want to pull something big, some big disaster, and then start deflating the economy, and then blame it on that disaster or that terror attack, and now they're starting to blame, oh, the economy isn't doing good like we said.
[01:25:12.313 --> 01:25:13.894]  They've been lying for years.
[01:25:13.914 --> 01:25:15.055]  It's not been good, folks.
[01:25:16.035 --> 01:25:18.196]  But, oh, it's because of the hurricane, see?
[01:25:18.216 --> 01:25:22.859]  Do you feel like they're waiting for the installation of the second Patriot Act?
[01:25:23.019 --> 01:25:26.000]  Well, they just don't have their whole program in place, and I appreciate your call.
[01:25:26.641 --> 01:25:29.322]  Sir, they've already implemented Patriot Act two years ago.
[01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.186]  They never passed it.
[01:25:31.206 --> 01:25:32.626]  They just implemented it.
[01:25:32.646 --> 01:25:35.148]  I mean, they don't even need laws to do what they're doing.
[01:25:35.188 --> 01:25:35.908]  They just do it.
[01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:41.592]  Okay, and it's admitted that Patriot Act II was an enemy combatant, secret arrest.
[01:25:42.072 --> 01:25:43.793]  All that was implemented three years ago.
[01:25:45.154 --> 01:25:47.475]  So they don't even need all of Patriot Act II to do that.
[01:25:48.415 --> 01:25:51.617]  Frankly, this was a big, big, big meal to eat.
[01:25:52.258 --> 01:25:54.479]  America's a big, big thing to gobble.
[01:25:54.986 --> 01:26:02.847]  And they're really, you know, it's like they're at a hot dog eating contest and they've eaten about 500 hot dogs and the globalists are greedy creatures, but they're having problems.
[01:26:03.487 --> 01:26:11.089]  And they're having problems with their own people following orders, their own people being ruthless, their own people carrying it out, FEMA's getting caught carrying out sabotage.
[01:26:11.549 --> 01:26:12.589]  This is all a test.
[01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:14.549]  I mean, it's not going to be easy taking us down.
[01:26:14.789 --> 01:26:15.690]  I've got to move quicker now.
[01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.110]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathan in Texas.
[01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:18.710]  Go ahead, Nathan.
[01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:19.850]  Hi.
[01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:23.671]  I went to Jefferson Parish on Monday
[01:26:24.386 --> 01:26:39.396]  Because my wife has, her family has some property there and in New Orleans, and I just can't express what it was like to be underneath that level of the number of helicopters, the number of Humvees driving around.
[01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:42.838]  The soldiers did have magazines in their M-16s.
[01:26:43.178 --> 01:26:44.559]  I wish you'd have shot some video of that.
[01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:47.301]  I did, and I have some real interesting video.
[01:26:47.381 --> 01:26:49.182]  Oh, will you please make me a copy of Melligan?
[01:26:49.202 --> 01:26:49.542]  Certainly.
[01:26:50.203 --> 01:26:50.903]  Oh, you're awesome.
[01:26:50.943 --> 01:26:53.865]  Pertaining specifically to FEMA, I was videoing
[01:26:54.423 --> 01:26:58.905]  After we cleaned up his house, videoing the helicopters, and this car pulls up.
[01:26:58.945 --> 01:27:00.806]  There weren't a lot of cars in Jefferson Parish.
[01:27:00.826 --> 01:27:05.868]  They were staggering the people, letting only a few cars in to go look at their property.
[01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:08.290]  Yes, instead of saving people, don't videotape.
[01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:12.291]  Well, they didn't like the fact that I started videotaping them, but they were asking directions.
[01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:16.313]  They didn't know where in the heck they were, and they were looking for a school.
[01:27:17.174 --> 01:27:22.056]  And they were just driving around asking people walking down the street if they knew where the schools were.
[01:27:22.651 --> 01:27:27.634]  And my wife knows New Orleans, and she asked them, do you have a street address for the school?
[01:27:27.855 --> 01:27:31.777]  And they had no address, just the name of a high school and no direction.
[01:27:32.618 --> 01:27:39.402]  And they looked like bureaucrats in a state, but they worked in Texas state government for 10 years, and they got promoted up to FEMA.
[01:27:39.823 --> 01:27:43.505]  And they had their FEMA shirts on and their water in the back seat, and then quickly they drove off.
[01:27:43.785 --> 01:27:46.847]  And they didn't even know to have a road map.
[01:27:47.087 --> 01:27:50.790]  With the map in one of their laps, you can tell it's just a general Louisiana map.
[01:27:51.801 --> 01:27:57.623]  They had no specific map for the Metairie area, which is west of Orleans Parish.
[01:27:57.663 --> 01:28:01.424]  Well, let's not take care of ourselves and make preparations to protect our families.
[01:28:01.764 --> 01:28:03.564]  Let's entrust our lives to them.
[01:28:03.644 --> 01:28:04.184]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:04.564 --> 01:28:06.665]  It was pretty eye-opening.
[01:28:06.685 --> 01:28:08.045]  And then another couple of things.
[01:28:08.065 --> 01:28:10.266]  I mean, there was so much that we saw.
[01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:11.626]  And I will send you the video.
[01:28:12.167 --> 01:28:19.809]  But we did see some sort of communication devices up on a lot of the telephone poles that were not your average communication device.
[01:28:20.129 --> 01:28:21.089]  Some kind of antennas.
[01:28:21.581 --> 01:28:22.101]  We're on the march.
[01:28:22.161 --> 01:28:22.942]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:22.962 --> 01:28:24.843]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.971 --> 01:28:56.533]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[01:28:56.573 --> 01:29:00.156]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:29:00.276 --> 01:29:00.656]  Shocking?
[01:29:00.756 --> 01:29:01.196]  Of course!
[01:29:01.477 --> 01:29:03.538]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:29:03.698 --> 01:29:06.580]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:29:06.801 --> 01:29:08.162]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[01:29:08.322 --> 01:29:12.585]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott Ph.D.
[01:29:12.765 --> 01:29:14.166]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.

[01:29:54.173 --> 01:29:56.154]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:56.214 --> 01:30:06.939]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:11.841]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:23.227]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.827 --> 01:30:30.669]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:31.069 --> 01:30:33.210]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:38.672]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.972 --> 01:30:45.094]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-8033.
[01:30:46.494 --> 01:31:03.460]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:06.081]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:06.321 --> 01:31:08.282]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:08.622 --> 01:31:13.984]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:14.364 --> 01:31:18.626]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:19.086 --> 01:31:26.990]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:27.170 --> 01:31:32.233]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:34.274]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:34.774 --> 01:31:37.915]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:31:38.135 --> 01:31:40.616]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.

[01:32:09.344 --> 01:32:19.389]  On prisonplanet.com Right now, we have a huge list of just all the things FEMA has been caught doing.
[01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:21.750]  We're going to go over some of that a little bit later.
[01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:29.795]  I mean, it's just very, very, very important to witness the full magnitude of their criminal activity.
[01:32:30.595 --> 01:32:32.856]  Go ahead, Nathan in Texas, and finish up what you were saying.
[01:32:33.096 --> 01:32:36.378]  Well, I guess the main point, just overall, was the feeling of
[01:32:37.273 --> 01:32:48.099]  Being in a state of martial law and the number of guns, the number of troops, the number of helicopters, and I don't think they were doing much rescuing on Monday, so I think that a lot of that was a show of force.
[01:32:48.839 --> 01:32:57.964]  And the number of... Just the C-130s flying over pretty low over Jefferson Parish.
[01:32:58.424 --> 01:32:59.025]  I mean, it was just...
[01:33:00.239 --> 01:33:00.899]  I hope that I never have.
[01:33:00.939 --> 01:33:04.241]  Well, it's been a minute just smoking cigarettes and pointing machine guns at people.
[01:33:04.261 --> 01:33:09.083]  Well, and I went right up to where the levee breached, and they were running out boats.
[01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:11.784]  They were running boats and rescuing dogs and rescuing people.
[01:33:12.524 --> 01:33:19.087]  And one of the rescue guys, of course, is wearing all black, has his machine gun, is barking orders at everyone.
[01:33:19.707 --> 01:33:21.828]  But they let me get right up to where everybody was.
[01:33:22.469 --> 01:33:28.051]  It wasn't as secure as they are making it seem like on television, if I was able to get that far.
[01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:34.436]  Well, yeah, it's just all about we have machine guns.
[01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:39.361]  We're not going to save you.
[01:33:39.381 --> 01:33:41.163]  We're just going to walk around acting tough.
[01:33:41.923 --> 01:33:44.206]  That's right, and I just hope I never have to experience that again.
[01:33:45.867 --> 01:33:49.131]  Well, what format did you shoot this video in?
[01:33:49.591 --> 01:33:49.691]  DV.
[01:33:51.212 --> 01:33:58.594]  Well, listen, if any of you have a good video, which I'm sure it is, we'll use it for the TV show and stuff.
[01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:05.556]  If you mail it to me and a little note in there that I'm allowed to use it, I'd love to be able to use that and show people.
[01:34:05.836 --> 01:34:07.317]  Yep, especially those boobs from FEMA.
[01:34:07.337 --> 01:34:08.017]  That was really great.
[01:34:10.377 --> 01:34:12.278]  Oh, yeah, so you've got video of them.
[01:34:12.478 --> 01:34:13.778]  Oh, yeah, they don't know where they are.
[01:34:14.179 --> 01:34:16.599]  They don't even know what they asked us.
[01:34:16.639 --> 01:34:19.320]  They said, if we keep going five miles that way, will we get there?
[01:34:19.972 --> 01:34:25.775]  And five miles in the direction they were pointing was way out of Jefferson Parish, way out of New Orleans.
[01:34:26.435 --> 01:34:27.796]  It was past the police barricades.
[01:34:27.816 --> 01:34:28.757]  They didn't know where they were.
[01:34:28.837 --> 01:34:31.358]  Well, those are actually invincible God creatures.
[01:34:31.918 --> 01:34:32.479]  You're nothing.
[01:34:32.519 --> 01:34:33.339]  Learn to worship them.
[01:34:33.679 --> 01:34:34.580]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.341]  And yeah, you can send any video, folks.
[01:34:37.361 --> 01:34:39.182]  Step off the news or video you've shot.
[01:34:39.923 --> 01:34:40.383]  We'd love it.
[01:34:40.423 --> 01:34:41.183]  It really helps us.
[01:34:41.203 --> 01:34:41.223]  3001-3001.
[01:34:45.123 --> 01:34:51.225]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:51.365 --> 01:35:00.388]  You know, I like to research where words come from, and do you know where the word boobies comes from?
[01:35:02.389 --> 01:35:11.071]  It comes from a group of pirates called boobies in the South China Sea that would feed on Portuguese fish,
[01:35:13.914 --> 01:35:15.875]  Dutch, British, Spanish ships.
[01:35:17.096 --> 01:35:19.378]  And they were called boobies.
[01:35:20.879 --> 01:35:28.704]  And then they kind of translated into a foolish idiot or a moron being called a boob.
[01:35:29.445 --> 01:35:34.288]  But just one time I called somebody a boobie on air and I got an email going, how dare you use profanity?
[01:35:34.809 --> 01:35:38.491]  Hey folks, if you're going to do that, you need to first learn what words actually mean.
[01:35:38.531 --> 01:35:39.772]  A boobie is a pirate.
[01:35:40.478 --> 01:35:41.858]  Go look that up in the encyclopedia.
[01:35:42.118 --> 01:35:43.959]  Not that I'm some master of words, either.
[01:35:46.579 --> 01:35:49.600]  One time in an article I wrote, I used the word niggardly.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:56.081]  And I got really hateful emails from mainly, I guess, white liberal types.
[01:35:56.161 --> 01:36:00.242]  And niggardly has nothing to do with the racist N-word.
[01:36:01.463 --> 01:36:05.023]  In fact, it predates European slavery.
[01:36:06.084 --> 01:36:07.744]  But again, you cannot explain that to people.
[01:36:08.873 --> 01:36:11.175]  So sometimes I get in trouble just because I use weird words.
[01:36:11.275 --> 01:36:15.757]  And I heard him use that word, and I thought, I better explain that.
[01:36:15.777 --> 01:36:18.819]  Again, I'm not even that smart, folks.
[01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:19.719]  This is what freaks me out.
[01:36:19.759 --> 01:36:24.242]  I mean, the vocabulary of Americans 100 years ago was much larger than it is now.
[01:36:25.683 --> 01:36:28.564]  Just 50 years ago, we had the number one test scores in the world.
[01:36:29.125 --> 01:36:33.847]  Now we have the lowest test scores, not just of the industrialized world, but of many third world countries.
[01:36:34.308 --> 01:36:36.709]  It's all been done by design.
[01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:47.665]  But there's so many of these people that don't know anything, nothing about the world, about geography, about history, but they got all their opinions about politics.
[01:36:48.265 --> 01:36:49.365]  And they are dangerous.
[01:36:49.465 --> 01:36:50.286]  They are dangerous.
[01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:53.827]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:36:55.287 --> 01:36:58.348]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick.
[01:36:58.469 --> 01:37:00.629]  Rick, where are you calling us from?
[01:37:01.009 --> 01:37:01.730]  Reno, Nevada.
[01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.330]  Welcome.
[01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:03.410]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:06.612]  A couple of nights ago I heard a report from someone.
[01:37:06.672 --> 01:37:07.792]  Maybe you can verify it.
[01:37:08.368 --> 01:37:21.012]  That in the Louisiana area, Gulf Coast area, the military was making military conscription a condition for evacuation and food and water.
[01:37:23.993 --> 01:37:24.973]  I don't believe that.
[01:37:25.033 --> 01:37:25.653]  I haven't heard that.
[01:37:26.434 --> 01:37:28.174]  I have no trouble believing it whatsoever.
[01:37:28.214 --> 01:37:30.215]  I was just hoping you could confirm that.
[01:37:30.335 --> 01:37:34.136]  Well, I have trouble just because when they get caught, they'll get in a lot of trouble.
[01:37:34.576 --> 01:37:36.577]  Now, are there cases of recruiters...
[01:37:37.316 --> 01:37:38.336]  Maybe intimidating?
[01:37:38.356 --> 01:37:39.137]  I mean, I know this.
[01:37:40.217 --> 01:37:41.998]  You have these agencies that are predatory.
[01:37:42.018 --> 01:37:55.722]  I mean, look, the local police get a bounty, not for convicting you from the feds, but just going to a home, if a neighbor called the cops and they heard yelling, nothing's even broken, no one's hurt.
[01:37:57.076 --> 01:38:05.719]  The department policies all over the country is arrest somebody, even if the charges get dropped, because they get thousands of dollars from the feds.
[01:38:06.099 --> 01:38:07.160]  So there's a bounty.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:15.463]  Well, Child Protective Services is all over the country, and it's the same thing with these recruiters and all of them.
[01:38:16.823 --> 01:38:18.984]  They literally have quotas.
[01:38:19.384 --> 01:38:20.624]  And this has all been in the news.
[01:38:20.944 --> 01:38:22.885]  From tickets to grabbing kids, there's quotas.
[01:38:24.246 --> 01:38:24.446]  And so...
[01:38:26.235 --> 01:38:29.657]  They don't want to go out and actually find abusive parents to call the police on.
[01:38:29.677 --> 01:38:31.938]  They don't want to go out and actually find a kid who's in trouble.
[01:38:32.258 --> 01:38:35.240]  No, it's just easier to feed and target the schools.
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.883]  And now with Head Start, you get three CPS visits to your house.
[01:38:39.923 --> 01:38:43.585]  Parents don't know that about 20% of the time they open a case against them.
[01:38:44.745 --> 01:38:48.247]  Again, it's like you want to go fishing where it's easy, even if the fish are innocent.
[01:38:48.427 --> 01:38:52.730]  There's the stupid way of trying to describe it.
[01:38:53.622 --> 01:38:54.163]  I mean, look.
[01:39:07.725 --> 01:39:15.329]  A blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby, and there's even been big mainstream media exposés on this, brings anywhere from $250,000 to half a million bucks.
[01:39:15.769 --> 01:39:27.335]  Because these rich families don't want to adopt a black kid or a Hispanic kid, though there are Christian families that do, and they can get $50,000 for one of those kids, $50,000 for a black kid, $100,000 for a Hispanic.
[01:39:27.735 --> 01:39:28.775]  And this is just the prices.
[01:39:29.256 --> 01:39:35.379]  But these poor white families are at a premium, and we've already got reports coming in, they're grabbing them here in Austin, they're grabbing their kids in...
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.841]  They're grabbing their... Well, you're destitute.
[01:39:37.861 --> 01:39:39.102]  Well, you can't take care of your kids now.
[01:39:39.482 --> 01:39:40.203]  We're going to take them.
[01:39:40.603 --> 01:39:42.024]  And then the family can't defend themselves.
[01:39:42.064 --> 01:39:43.125]  The kid's up for adoption.
[01:39:43.145 --> 01:39:44.846]  They throw some false charges on the parents.
[01:39:45.486 --> 01:39:47.507]  So are there... I haven't seen reports of this.
[01:39:47.587 --> 01:39:48.228]  I don't doubt it.
[01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:50.930]  Are there recruiters maybe intimidating people?
[01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:52.531]  Or we got a way out for you?
[01:39:52.571 --> 01:39:52.891]  Maybe.
[01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:55.353]  But, I mean, you said you heard this.
[01:39:55.413 --> 01:39:56.613]  I mean, what was the source?
[01:39:56.793 --> 01:39:58.174]  This was two nights ago.
[01:39:59.055 --> 01:40:00.596]  Morning before last, actually.
[01:40:00.616 --> 01:40:01.256]  Wee hours.
[01:40:01.977 --> 01:40:03.958]  KGO 810 San Francisco.
[01:40:04.358 --> 01:40:04.759]  A caller...
[01:40:05.697 --> 01:40:07.698]  I gave this information to the talk show host.
[01:40:07.858 --> 01:40:13.162]  But, I mean, see, a caller says, and then... Yeah, I was just looking for some confirmation from you.
[01:40:13.702 --> 01:40:18.705]  You know, I don't... I mean, they'll threaten to arrest you, and then they'll do intimidation and stuff, and some... I mean, I don't know.
[01:40:18.765 --> 01:40:19.585]  Maybe they are.
[01:40:19.645 --> 01:40:20.266]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:40:20.306 --> 01:40:25.529]  Maybe from Houston to Denver, if they really are threatening to arrest people, they don't sound out of line.
[01:40:25.549 --> 01:40:26.950]  I mean, it's totally criminal.
[01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:28.631]  Now, Alex... Maybe they are.
[01:40:28.871 --> 01:40:31.453]  Have you been looking down the road to the...
[01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:43.700]  Potential for mass outbreaks of plagues and diseases as a result of infected folks leaving the Gulf Coast area.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.162]  I think the government's going to fearmonger with all of that.
[01:40:46.182 --> 01:40:49.725]  They're saying typhus could be a problem.
[01:40:50.906 --> 01:40:53.028]  They're saying cholera could maybe even break out.
[01:40:53.068 --> 01:40:55.110]  They're saying E. coli has killed a bunch of people.
[01:40:56.361 --> 01:41:03.987]  I wouldn't be surprised at all if Bird, Blue, and West Nile were to break out in several different places simultaneously in the next few weeks or months.
[01:41:04.268 --> 01:41:04.828]  Well, we'll see.
[01:41:04.848 --> 01:41:05.489]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:07.050 --> 01:41:07.571]  I know this.
[01:41:07.591 --> 01:41:12.795]  I have a friend who works in security at the Austin-Bertstrom International Airport.
[01:41:14.737 --> 01:41:22.644]  And they tell the people when they come off the planes being flown in from other areas, they're not just being busted, they tell them, oh, you'll be getting your stuff back, oh, you'll be getting your bag back.
[01:41:23.197 --> 01:41:25.679]  They'll have a bag with pictures or rings in it.
[01:41:26.579 --> 01:41:27.760]  And I was told this.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:29.841]  And they take it.
[01:41:30.281 --> 01:41:32.223]  Of course, it's being dug through for goodies.
[01:41:32.803 --> 01:41:34.264]  But they take it and incinerate it.
[01:41:34.724 --> 01:41:36.345]  It's taken in a truck to an incinerator.
[01:41:36.745 --> 01:41:37.506]  And they lie to them.
[01:41:37.566 --> 01:41:38.787]  Oh, you'll get your stuff back.
[01:41:38.807 --> 01:41:39.307]  Sure you will.
[01:41:39.767 --> 01:41:41.148]  And the excuse is typhus.
[01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:46.651]  But believe me, folks, they want people totally to institute nothing.
[01:41:47.472 --> 01:41:52.255]  And so basically, it's like after a battle in olden times with the blackbirds and the vultures and the...
[01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:58.332]  And the other carrion eaters would come to the battlefield and feed.
[01:41:58.992 --> 01:42:05.015]  And right now the CPS and the cops and the government, I mean, they're all racking up their collars right now.
[01:42:05.895 --> 01:42:08.876]  I mean, it's like hitting the jackpot every five seconds.
[01:42:08.896 --> 01:42:11.917]  You've got defenseless people with no ID, no nothing.
[01:42:12.217 --> 01:42:14.978]  You've got parents that gave their kids up to buses and military.
[01:42:14.998 --> 01:42:16.299]  You've got CPS waiting.
[01:42:17.088 --> 01:42:17.989]  They get bounties.
[01:42:18.009 --> 01:42:18.869]  They get promotions.
[01:42:18.969 --> 01:42:20.971]  It's just child kidnapping.
[01:42:22.172 --> 01:42:25.094]  It's a wild feast of evil.
[01:42:26.455 --> 01:42:27.095]  I'm not kidding.
[01:42:28.656 --> 01:42:30.157]  It's your government, folks.
[01:42:30.218 --> 01:42:31.518]  It's your government.
[01:42:31.558 --> 01:42:34.981]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New York.
[01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:35.661]  Go ahead, John.
[01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:39.744]  Okay.
[01:42:40.805 --> 01:42:42.286]  No, I just talked to Rick and Reno.
[01:42:43.007 --> 01:42:43.127]  Yeah.
[01:42:43.147 --> 01:42:43.267]  Yeah.
[01:42:44.238 --> 01:42:45.078]  Okay, John hung up.
[01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:46.879]  Robert in Rhode Island.
[01:42:46.919 --> 01:42:47.940]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:48.780]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.320]  What's going on?
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:49.840]  Hi.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.621]  Hey, man.
[01:42:50.721 --> 01:42:52.101]  Your call is giving me hope.
[01:42:53.082 --> 01:42:54.762]  And I want to ask you something.
[01:42:54.942 --> 01:43:01.145]  A little while ago, I heard you interview Paul Craig Roberts, and he talked about the agencies down there in New Orleans being federalized.
[01:43:02.823 --> 01:43:05.966]  Yes, everybody knows that who's got their head screwed on straight.
[01:43:06.467 --> 01:43:08.509]  New Orleans was federalized two and a half years ago.
[01:43:08.609 --> 01:43:10.871]  Every major agency in the entire city was federalized.
[01:43:11.171 --> 01:43:12.873]  So the blame on the locals is a fraud.
[01:43:13.193 --> 01:43:15.535]  They federalized it to then lower the defenses.
[01:43:17.377 --> 01:43:20.640]  And then also, he was number two at the Treasury.
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.443]  He even orchestrated a lot of funding for disaster relief.
[01:43:24.243 --> 01:43:25.264]  He's got degrees in this.
[01:43:26.590 --> 01:43:30.814]  FEMA holds the money, and so they set the policies for all the cities.
[01:43:31.114 --> 01:43:32.235]  They tell them what to do.
[01:43:32.615 --> 01:43:36.018]  So there's lots of FEMA posing and saying, well, do we have permission?
[01:43:36.519 --> 01:43:38.280]  Well, FEMA's been in control since day one.
[01:43:38.601 --> 01:43:45.707]  How about saying that the mayor withheld 500 buses to bust the people out?
[01:43:45.907 --> 01:43:46.908]  That's not true.
[01:43:46.968 --> 01:43:49.830]  I mean, again, I hate that mayor, but I love Bush.
[01:43:50.531 --> 01:43:52.373]  It's all them just playing each other off.
[01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:53.634]  I mean, the government's bad, period.
[01:43:54.111 --> 01:43:54.731]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:55.071 --> 01:43:55.952]  I made the mistake, man.
[01:43:56.132 --> 01:44:03.195]  I thought I'd listen to your show a little while ago, and I did vote for sellout John Kerry, but I opened up my eyes a little bit afterwards.
[01:44:04.295 --> 01:44:08.477]  And I just wish Fox had the cojones to do Hannity and Jones.
[01:44:09.237 --> 01:44:10.578]  Man, you're doing great work, brother.
[01:44:10.618 --> 01:44:11.538]  Keep up the job, man.
[01:44:11.978 --> 01:44:13.259]  Appreciate it.
[01:44:13.359 --> 01:44:14.139]  I appreciate it.
[01:44:14.539 --> 01:44:15.800]  Hannity and Jones.
[01:44:17.381 --> 01:44:17.981]  That's funny.
[01:44:18.601 --> 01:44:20.482]  Yeah, that'll happen when hell freezes over.
[01:44:21.286 --> 01:44:25.147]  They either want liberal, fake liberalness or fake conservatism.
[01:44:25.187 --> 01:44:26.667]  A fake spectrum.
[01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:28.708]  It's a scam, folks.
[01:44:29.088 --> 01:44:33.169]  It's an old sales technique to tell you this is the scope of the choices.
[01:44:33.209 --> 01:44:34.569]  This is the scope of the world.
[01:44:34.909 --> 01:44:36.510]  This is the road map to the world.
[01:44:37.410 --> 01:44:40.211]  This is the sum of all things.
[01:44:40.711 --> 01:44:44.632]  And then you choose within that limited, fake, false spectrum.
[01:44:46.692 --> 01:44:49.433]  Left and right didn't exist until about 105 years ago.
[01:44:51.058 --> 01:44:59.580]  And the big robber barons paid with endowments to have it become what was taught in political science at all the universities.
[01:45:00.941 --> 01:45:01.941]  Left and right did not exist.
[01:45:01.961 --> 01:45:02.921]  It was freedom versus slavery.
[01:45:02.941 --> 01:45:08.443]  It was monarchy or oligarchy versus democracy versus constitutional republic.
[01:45:09.323 --> 01:45:14.884]  And people actually had the real political terms to be able to have real debates.
[01:45:18.143 --> 01:45:19.364]  Well, it's like a computer, folks.
[01:45:19.384 --> 01:45:22.045]  You give it false info, it can't make a real calculation.
[01:45:23.365 --> 01:45:29.308]  So they basically introduced political viruses into our workings, and we're still stuck on them.
[01:45:29.368 --> 01:45:31.809]  It's like a CD or a computer skipping.
[01:45:31.849 --> 01:45:37.032]  It's just... It just never gets off that.
[01:45:37.172 --> 01:45:39.453]  You have these socially retarded people everywhere.
[01:45:40.191 --> 01:45:44.333]  Who are into their liberalism or into my conservatism.
[01:45:44.873 --> 01:45:46.414]  And it isn't about liberal or conservative.
[01:45:46.434 --> 01:45:51.436]  It's about worshipping their group, being part of that group, mindlessly defending the falsehoods.
[01:45:52.597 --> 01:45:54.097]  When both groups are bought and paid for.
[01:45:55.618 --> 01:45:56.598]  Ruben in Ohio.
[01:45:56.638 --> 01:45:57.479]  Ruben, you're on the air.
[01:45:57.539 --> 01:45:57.839]  Welcome.
[01:46:01.161 --> 01:46:01.581]  All right.
[01:46:01.841 --> 01:46:02.121]  Well...
[01:46:02.851 --> 01:46:03.332]  Hey, you there?
[01:46:03.612 --> 01:46:03.872]  Yes.
[01:46:04.112 --> 01:46:04.352]  Okay.
[01:46:04.673 --> 01:46:05.553]  Love your show.
[01:46:05.633 --> 01:46:11.338]  Tim in Ohio inspired me to call up with the little story I had when I went to Twinsburg Public Library here.
[01:46:11.638 --> 01:46:11.898]  Yes.
[01:46:11.978 --> 01:46:12.959]  In Northeast Ohio.
[01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:13.340]  Yes.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.861]  Just to use their computer.
[01:46:14.881 --> 01:46:19.064]  And it's the first time I've ever used the computer there in Twinsburg.
[01:46:19.545 --> 01:46:23.368]  And the lady says she needs my library card.
[01:46:23.688 --> 01:46:26.490]  So she swipes my library card and says, you're at computer three.
[01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:31.194]  I sit down and, you know, I never had to swipe my library card to use Twinsburg.
[01:46:36.839 --> 01:46:45.482]  Yeah, it's all part of the chilling effect.
[01:46:45.522 --> 01:46:49.323]  Hey, burning books and restricting access to reading is what freedom's all about.
[01:46:50.043 --> 01:46:52.064]  Yeah, it freaked the heck out of me.
[01:46:52.264 --> 01:46:52.964]  It really did.
[01:46:52.984 --> 01:46:54.325]  Well, sir, that's freedom.
[01:46:54.345 --> 01:46:55.885]  That's what the Founding Fathers fought.
[01:46:56.185 --> 01:46:57.786]  Well, I've had enough of that freedom.
[01:46:57.826 --> 01:46:58.286]  No, no, listen.
[01:46:58.646 --> 01:47:01.587]  George Washington said, we're fighting for slavery.
[01:47:02.307 --> 01:47:03.748]  We're fighting so there's no freedom.
[01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:06.651]  We're fighting so the government knows what you read.
[01:47:06.671 --> 01:47:09.313]  We're fighting so there's no freedom, no private property.
[01:47:09.693 --> 01:47:11.515]  We're fighting so our children will be slaves.
[01:47:12.552 --> 01:47:14.313]  Actually, he said the opposite, but so what?
[01:47:14.373 --> 01:47:25.198]  I mean, let's just, you know... Hey, on a side note, Alex, I think Jim Tucker from the American Free Press wrote a favorable article for the new Supreme Court nominee, which, am I right?
[01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:30.340]  Yeah, he's getting a lot of heat for writing a favorable article for Roberts, where... What's your take on it?
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:32.721]  Well, Roberts, well, it's like this.
[01:47:33.181 --> 01:47:34.122]  He's a mystery man.
[01:47:34.622 --> 01:47:36.323]  Well, let me... Man, not really.
[01:47:36.923 --> 01:47:41.145]  I mean, if you've got a latrine that's half...
[01:47:42.371 --> 01:47:43.571]  Uh, excrement.
[01:47:44.092 --> 01:47:46.932]  You've got a latrine that's 5% excrement.
[01:47:47.492 --> 01:47:49.653]  You know, again, they give you false choices.
[01:47:49.693 --> 01:47:51.314]  Do you want to bathe in one or the other?
[01:47:51.354 --> 01:47:52.374]  Well, I don't want to bathe in either.
[01:47:52.874 --> 01:47:53.814]  He's the latrine that's 5%.
[01:47:53.874 --> 01:47:56.315]  Gonzalez is 100%.
[01:47:57.375 --> 01:47:59.836]  So, I mean, he said that Bush is above the law.
[01:48:00.516 --> 01:48:01.596]  This is what Roberts said.
[01:48:01.636 --> 01:48:06.558]  He agreed with Gonzalez that Bush is basically God, but they can secretly arrest citizens and put us in camps.
[01:48:07.118 --> 01:48:07.858]  He is horrible.
[01:48:08.487 --> 01:48:10.629]  But he's not a member of Mecha Ola Raza.
[01:48:10.649 --> 01:48:12.950]  He's not a white supremacist or a Hispanic supremacist.
[01:48:14.191 --> 01:48:17.694]  And he has been anti-abortion in some cases, though not in others.
[01:48:18.374 --> 01:48:19.595]  And he's very sneaky.
[01:48:19.615 --> 01:48:21.917]  He's a total Bush insider, and he's obviously horrible.
[01:48:22.497 --> 01:48:25.620]  But Tucker's looking at him and saying, well, he's got to be better than Gonzalez.
[01:48:26.641 --> 01:48:29.042]  And so, you know, I mean, I don't know what to say.
[01:48:29.523 --> 01:48:30.503]  I got one last thing.
[01:48:30.563 --> 01:48:37.829]  Since you like to find out where words come from, see if you can find out where the actual word G-O-D, God, came from.
[01:48:38.655 --> 01:48:42.477]  Because... It's for ball or bail.
[01:48:43.737 --> 01:48:49.120]  God, I mean, you know... I don't know.
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:51.401]  I've read that in several books on the subject.
[01:48:51.581 --> 01:48:59.385]  Because I read something bizarre in an Islamic text that it stood for Government Ordinance and Department of Justice.
[01:48:59.755 --> 01:49:00.555]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[01:49:01.416 --> 01:49:04.397]  This Islamic stuff was way, way out there.
[01:49:05.037 --> 01:49:17.583]  But I was just, you know... That's the way the Muslim religion works, is anybody who wants to preach and be their own cleric and basically claim they're a prophet and say whatever they want, which, you know... I mean, that's the same thing with Christianity.
[01:49:17.603 --> 01:49:19.404]  That's why you've got a million different denominations.
[01:49:20.345 --> 01:49:25.107]  But... Well, it was from the perspective, like, we don't know the true history of this country.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.621]  And it made me look up where the word God came from.
[01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:32.263]  Well, I mean, God just goes back to a base pagan word.
[01:49:33.224 --> 01:49:33.684]  Got it.
[01:49:33.724 --> 01:49:35.045]  Yeah, so is Lord.
[01:49:35.165 --> 01:49:38.427]  But, I mean, those were translations out of Greek.
[01:49:39.287 --> 01:49:41.348]  People can then say, well, that means those words are evil.
[01:49:41.368 --> 01:49:42.969]  And it doesn't necessarily mean that, folks.
[01:49:42.989 --> 01:49:44.390]  It's what you think it means.
[01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:45.891]  I mean, language is language.
[01:49:48.072 --> 01:49:50.053]  It's like fag used to mean a burning ember.
[01:49:50.093 --> 01:49:51.094]  Now it means a homosexual.
[01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:55.462]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.623 --> 01:49:58.725]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.845 --> 01:50:02.768]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.809 --> 01:50:07.052]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:50:07.392 --> 01:50:11.175]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.235 --> 01:50:13.037]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.297 --> 01:50:16.598]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.638 --> 01:50:21.339]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.499 --> 01:50:24.540]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.580]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.081 --> 01:50:34.182]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.722 --> 01:50:35.242]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.553 --> 01:50:57.456]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.676 --> 01:51:03.120]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:13.767]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.927 --> 01:51:18.270]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.450 --> 01:51:26.794]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.074 --> 01:51:33.457]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.557 --> 01:51:38.039]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.259 --> 01:51:42.461]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:42.842 --> 01:51:47.144]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:51:47.824 --> 01:51:48.284]  We're good to go.
[01:52:10.183 --> 01:52:10.864]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.458 --> 01:52:30.938]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.958 --> 01:52:31.118]  I think?
[01:53:09.432 --> 01:53:10.753]  I love taking your calls.
[01:53:10.773 --> 01:53:12.974]  You never know what direction the callers will take us.
[01:53:13.074 --> 01:53:14.995]  It's always interesting.
[01:53:15.015 --> 01:53:19.318]  We'll continue covering what's happening with these new Supreme Court nominees.
[01:53:20.319 --> 01:53:21.660]  Will it be Alberto Gonzalez?
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:22.180]  Probably not.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:27.784]  We shot down that trial balloon back when Bush tried to flood it a few months ago, but when the rink was dying over the weekend.
[01:53:29.363 --> 01:53:32.726]  We'll also get into, again, I want to go over some of the things that FEMA's been doing.
[01:53:33.266 --> 01:53:36.388]  Jamming police communications, cutting lines, not letting food and water in.
[01:53:36.789 --> 01:53:42.013]  Got a big chronological order of this on prisonplanet.com.
[01:53:43.374 --> 01:53:47.857]  Right now, let's go to Mark in Texas and Ron, Walt, and Mike and many others.
[01:53:48.117 --> 01:53:49.338]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Mark.
[01:53:49.759 --> 01:53:51.060]  Alex, good afternoon, buddy.
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:56.324]  You know that before long, those spin machines are already figuring out how they're going to cover all this up, or...
[01:53:56.912 --> 01:53:58.773]  Come out with an official explanation.
[01:53:58.793 --> 01:54:03.677]  And once that takes place, any talk of this after that is going to be nothing but conspiracy theories.
[01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:08.280]  Well, there's feds also, big ones on TV, floating.
[01:54:09.421 --> 01:54:12.623]  And I'm not watching much TV, but I'm having to watch some, and I hear them floating.
[01:54:13.244 --> 01:54:15.385]  Oh, this is when the terrorists are probably going to hit us.
[01:54:15.425 --> 01:54:17.847]  How dare the terrorists hit us when we're down?
[01:54:18.067 --> 01:54:21.090]  We better rally around the president and let troops run our lives.
[01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:22.971]  Only that's going to keep us safe.
[01:54:24.172 --> 01:54:25.713]  Sir, in situations like this,
[01:54:26.354 --> 01:54:33.159]  How difficult or how large of a task would it be to put together a Citizens Review Board?
[01:54:33.479 --> 01:54:37.542]  What I'm saying is right now, if we could get Ron Paul... Hillary and Bush, notice how they work together.
[01:54:37.582 --> 01:54:38.043]  Same day.
[01:54:38.063 --> 01:54:39.384]  We need a 9-11 commission.
[01:54:39.404 --> 01:54:39.604]  Yeah.
[01:54:39.884 --> 01:54:42.926]  Appointed by them to then call for total government takeover.
[01:54:43.327 --> 01:54:44.348]  You've been bad, government.
[01:54:44.368 --> 01:54:45.468]  We're going to give you total power.
[01:54:45.889 --> 01:54:47.290]  Alex, a Citizens Review Board.
[01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:54.135]  In other words, people like us, and I hate to say it, you know, us, but, you know, like right now, if we could get Ron Paul...
[01:54:54.522 --> 01:54:54.842]  And Ms.
[01:54:54.883 --> 01:55:03.754]  Landrieu from Louisiana, Harry, you know, the Sheriff Lee from down there, Mr. Bruchard, which you played some of his tapes on from Meet the Press.
[01:55:04.275 --> 01:55:05.557]  Get these folks together.
[01:55:06.037 --> 01:55:07.559]  Get it out in the open now.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.845]  See, in other words, this review board doesn't disintegrate
[01:55:12.495 --> 01:55:12.815]  Once.
[01:55:13.396 --> 01:55:17.599]  But notice Bush is saying, let's not debate why this happened.
[01:55:18.199 --> 01:55:20.361]  Let us just move on with saving people.
[01:55:20.841 --> 01:55:26.285]  That's so they can stage the propaganda, or catapult the propaganda, as Bush likes to say.
[01:55:26.886 --> 01:55:28.166]  They're writing it as we speak.
[01:55:28.186 --> 01:55:31.509]  Well, they'd already written it.
[01:55:31.549 --> 01:55:34.551]  They're trying to blame it on the state and the city.
[01:55:34.611 --> 01:55:37.773]  But the problem is the feds had already federalized all that.
[01:55:38.254 --> 01:55:41.336]  But from a communications standpoint, how can we go about that
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.041]  To get the word out.
[01:55:43.921 --> 01:56:01.372]  In other words, if we did hold a Citizens Committee review board on this thing, and we did have some prominent individuals that did have it... I mean, I think it's a good idea, but listen, there have been countless Citizens 9-11 review boards and members of Congress, and it does get on C-SPAN sometimes and stuff, but it doesn't get a lot of press.
[01:56:01.412 --> 01:56:05.594]  So that's not going to be a magic bullet, but I think it's a step in the right direction.
[01:56:06.455 --> 01:56:07.976]  I'll call you if I come up with anything else.
[01:56:08.036 --> 01:56:08.456]  I'm on it.
[01:56:08.716 --> 01:56:11.158]  Yeah, I mean, I could try to call Ron Paul up, try to call that...
[01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:15.835]  I'm one of some of those folks, so they might not say they're too busy, because right now it's pretty much been taken out of their hands.
[01:56:15.855 --> 01:56:16.216]  No, I hear it.
[01:56:16.256 --> 01:56:17.777]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:36.733 --> 01:56:37.674]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:37.714 --> 01:56:38.655]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:39.175 --> 01:56:43.479]  All right, let's go ahead and now go to Ron in California.
[01:56:43.559 --> 01:56:44.340]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.441]  How are you doing?
[01:56:45.861 --> 01:56:46.082]  Good.
[01:56:47.403 --> 01:56:51.547]  I just had a little comment on the guy you were on the radio with last night.
[01:56:52.568 --> 01:56:53.508]  I don't really understand.
[01:56:53.528 --> 01:56:54.309]  What's his deal?
[01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:58.313]  You might want to introduce it for folks because this isn't a private conversation.
[01:56:58.755 --> 01:57:02.297]  The guy, John, I don't remember his name.
[01:57:02.497 --> 01:57:11.882]  Yeah, John Ronson, whose idea it was for myself and Mike Hanson to sneak in to the Bohemian Grove, and then he would admit that it's satanic, but it's no big deal.
[01:57:12.882 --> 01:57:15.084]  Yeah, I thought he was totally ridiculous.
[01:57:15.664 --> 01:57:16.444]  Well, we'll stay there.
[01:57:16.464 --> 01:57:24.929]  I mean, if you want to, when we start the next hour, you can comment on... John Ronson for three hours on Coast to Coast, they were gracious enough to let me pop in for a few minutes.
[01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:26.930]  For us.
[01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:29.536]  Half an hour, and I certainly enjoyed it.
[01:57:29.897 --> 01:57:31.298]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:33.861 --> 01:57:38.427]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.447 --> 01:57:38.547]  Hello!
[01:57:50.206 --> 01:57:50.866]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.507 --> 01:57:52.587]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.288 --> 01:57:54.489]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.049 --> 01:57:55.909]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.630 --> 01:57:58.151]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.191 --> 01:58:01.813]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.353 --> 01:58:06.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.196 --> 01:58:12.679]  All right, let me pose this question to the listeners as we take tons of your calls this hour and cover more of the news.
[01:58:15.921 --> 01:58:17.582]  What do you think is going to happen with the economy?
[01:58:18.231 --> 01:58:28.677]  Just days before this hurricane hit, the head of the Federal Reserve was going around saying we could have a crash in one of the final bubbles left holding up the economy, real estate.
[01:58:28.697 --> 01:58:33.319]  We have global indicators coming out that the American economy is in deep trouble.
[01:58:33.619 --> 01:58:36.481]  Meanwhile, Bush and the Democrats are dancing around saying everything's wonderful.
[01:58:37.803 --> 01:58:38.824]  World government's wonderful.
[01:58:38.864 --> 01:58:41.305]  Globalism's been good for us when it's been the opposite.
[01:58:41.325 --> 01:58:43.987]  It's been like cyanide to the economy.
[01:58:44.027 --> 01:58:47.069]  They're passing CAFTA.
[01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:50.531]  They're passing forced psychological testing, national ID cards.
[01:58:52.112 --> 01:58:57.215]  FEMA's been caught sabotaging and engaging in criminal activities all over Louisiana and other areas.
[01:58:57.355 --> 01:58:59.196]  We will get into more detail on that in this hour.
[01:58:59.857 --> 01:59:00.737]  All this stuff's happening.
[01:59:01.518 --> 01:59:02.858]  And so you're welcome to call in about at 800-259-9231.
[01:59:02.878 --> 01:59:03.399]  We'll be going to
[01:59:06.781 --> 01:59:09.202]  Walt and then Mike and others here.
[01:59:09.282 --> 01:59:11.463]  Mike's in Georgia, but says he just got back from Louisiana.
[01:59:11.483 --> 01:59:13.344]  We'll be talking to him in the next segment.
[01:59:13.784 --> 01:59:16.846]  Right now, we're talking to Ron in California.
[01:59:17.386 --> 01:59:28.791]  Ron heard me on Coast to Coast AM last night, and John Ronson, who wrote a book about me, a TV documentary about our infiltration of Bohemian Grove and other things, was on there about...
[01:59:30.347 --> 01:59:43.694]  The Pentagon's admissions of basically black magic, training Fort Bragg troops in black magic, shows how into the occult our government is going back into the 80s and how they're using black magic in the torture of people.
[01:59:45.115 --> 01:59:47.376]  He was admitting it, but saying, oh, it's not really black magic.
[01:59:47.396 --> 01:59:48.237]  They're just goofy.
[01:59:48.577 --> 01:59:49.297]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:59:49.898 --> 01:59:56.181]  Oh, but Colonel Alexander did come up with all the ideas for the sound cannons and all this other stuff.
[01:59:56.261 --> 01:59:59.163]  Army, be all you can be, a new age term.
[02:00:00.859 --> 02:00:03.680]  So, you know, Ronson, though, I would say has come a long way.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.300]  I mean, he used to think it was all just a big joke.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:07.661]  Now he's saying, yeah, Bohemian Grove is serious.
[02:00:07.681 --> 02:00:09.821]  Yeah, the Pentagon is serious.
[02:00:09.861 --> 02:00:12.422]  But, I mean, you say you have a problem with him.
[02:00:12.482 --> 02:00:13.242]  I mean, what is it?
[02:00:13.262 --> 02:00:14.642]  Well, I don't really have a problem with him.
[02:00:14.682 --> 02:00:21.924]  But, I mean, it's just the way that he was going about saying stuff and kind of like saying he didn't agree with you and stuff.
[02:00:21.984 --> 02:00:22.584]  It just seemed like...
[02:00:23.519 --> 02:00:24.140]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:25.360]  They're not really, but they say they are.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:30.004]  Taxes take our freedoms and then do a horrible job when there's a problem because then they'll get even more power.
[02:00:47.079 --> 02:00:47.419]  That's true.
[02:00:47.659 --> 02:00:48.279]  You get a point.
[02:01:10.025 --> 02:01:10.806]  I mean, look at them now.
[02:01:10.846 --> 02:01:11.807]  They can't even deny it.
[02:01:11.827 --> 02:01:21.214]  I mean, when I'm on there debating former Nightline producers and former top DEA agents, they're like, Alex, the government did blow up Building 7, but it was for their own good.
[02:01:21.254 --> 02:01:23.736]  I mean, they can't even debate with me anymore.
[02:01:23.756 --> 02:01:26.638]  They just have to go, okay, it's all true, but it isn't bad.
[02:01:28.059 --> 02:01:33.103]  You know, so it's just, we're actually winning.
[02:01:33.183 --> 02:01:33.744]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:01:34.324 --> 02:01:34.824]  You know what it is?
[02:01:34.844 --> 02:01:37.667]  You're probably trying to convince your family, and I don't think they respect you.
[02:01:37.687 --> 02:01:38.707]  Not at all.
[02:01:40.163 --> 02:01:43.564]  Yeah, I mean, the only folks I find where they can't, quote, wake people up is it's their family.
[02:01:43.885 --> 02:01:45.245]  Stop wasting time with your family.
[02:01:45.465 --> 02:01:47.406]  They'll respect them.
[02:01:47.606 --> 02:01:50.507]  They'll start respecting you when you just stop talking to them.
[02:01:50.947 --> 02:01:52.248]  Yeah.
[02:01:52.308 --> 02:01:55.989]  No, when somebody treats you with disrespect, just don't treat them with disrespect.
[02:01:56.009 --> 02:01:57.890]  Just go, hey, I'm going to shun them.
[02:01:58.210 --> 02:02:00.451]  Shunning people is a great way to deal with them.
[02:02:00.471 --> 02:02:01.071]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:02.232 --> 02:02:04.113]  And by the way, you know, I'm getting ready.
[02:02:04.793 --> 02:02:07.374]  Just letting people know to start exposing fake patriots.
[02:02:08.104 --> 02:02:08.964]  I haven't done this.
[02:02:09.044 --> 02:02:09.945]  I've never really done this.
[02:02:09.985 --> 02:02:12.846]  But I think they're damaging things bad enough now.
[02:02:14.826 --> 02:02:17.967]  Some of the people on other networks and other folks that are just lying.
[02:02:18.388 --> 02:02:24.330]  But I've actually began writing notes up and preparing a case against these people that's just totally rock solid.
[02:02:25.530 --> 02:02:32.212]  I'm tired of being attacked and savaged and lied about and treated badly and covertly attacked.
[02:02:35.594 --> 02:02:36.774]  I'm going to take some folks...
[02:02:37.481 --> 02:02:39.144]  I'm going to take them down to the altar.
[02:02:39.985 --> 02:02:42.710]  I'm going to spank them real good, real soon, so you stay tuned for that.
[02:02:47.105 --> 02:02:49.946]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.206 --> 02:02:51.787]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.127 --> 02:02:56.789]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.149 --> 02:03:01.571]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.992 --> 02:03:06.193]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.393 --> 02:03:07.614]  The Constitution has been shredded.
[02:03:07.814 --> 02:03:10.034]  Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping
[02:03:36.539 --> 02:03:41.011]  That's Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:54.926]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:55.146 --> 02:04:06.416]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:06.636 --> 02:04:09.298]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:09.638 --> 02:04:13.742]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[02:04:14.082 --> 02:04:24.329]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:30.233]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:30.573 --> 02:04:39.075]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:39.135 --> 02:04:42.816]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:43.456 --> 02:04:44.776]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:51.998 --> 02:04:57.039]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:57.179 --> 02:04:59.680]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:30.177 --> 02:05:33.699]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:05:33.779 --> 02:05:35.600]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.220]  We've got about
[02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:40.844]  52 minutes left in the broadcast today.
[02:05:40.864 --> 02:05:45.246]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:05:46.046 --> 02:05:48.347]  Again, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.367 --> 02:05:50.407]  You know, I never picked that name.
[02:05:51.548 --> 02:05:59.390]  The first name that I gave myself, that I gave the radio show about 10 years ago, or I guess longer now, was The Real Spin.
[02:06:00.757 --> 02:06:02.018]  The real spin.
[02:06:02.038 --> 02:06:13.405]  Because I thought, you know, the media spins everything, and everything in life does have complex issues and folds and twists and turns, but a lot of stuff is just basically cut down to right and wrong.
[02:06:13.425 --> 02:06:17.568]  And I said, there is a certain spin to things, so we'll call it the real spin.
[02:06:19.729 --> 02:06:22.471]  And then, of course...
[02:06:24.269 --> 02:06:38.802]  I started getting on different Patriot Radio satellite outlets, and then Ted Anderson came along and took the Patriot Network from Tinker Toy level up to something really trying to get on commercial AM and FM stations, and we've effectively done that.
[02:06:38.922 --> 02:06:45.527]  And he's like, well, Michael Trudeau said, we'll just call it the Alex Jones Show, which I never liked that name, but that's been the name.
[02:06:46.828 --> 02:06:50.892]  I always wanted to call the show Real Talk Radio, and basically that was the unofficial name.
[02:06:51.974 --> 02:06:53.936]  And I got the t-shirts to prove it, by the way.
[02:06:54.016 --> 02:06:58.900]  I even got listeners to be sure to say, Alex Jones and Real Talk Radio, real issues of real significance.
[02:06:59.661 --> 02:07:03.524]  And it's a great name for a radio show, and it's the name of my radio show.
[02:07:04.445 --> 02:07:08.128]  But some people have proclivities to call their shows the names of other people's shows.
[02:07:08.728 --> 02:07:09.589]  More than once, I guess.
[02:07:09.609 --> 02:07:10.550]  There's kind of a history of that.
[02:07:11.511 --> 02:07:16.555]  But I don't even know why I'm babbling telling this story.
[02:07:17.216 --> 02:07:18.317]  It's just that it's...
[02:07:19.227 --> 02:07:32.936]  It's been a good run, and we're exposing the New World Order more than ever, and I'm just thankful to God that I'm able to get up here on the air Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to midnight and expose the forces of the New World Order.
[02:07:33.476 --> 02:07:40.681]  I'm going to get into these articles, FEMA deliberately sabotaging hurricane relief efforts, and several other articles we put together that are so important.
[02:07:40.701 --> 02:07:46.245]  I have another article that a listener compiled that I read over is very accurate of just
[02:07:47.123 --> 02:07:47.643]  Hello, Alex.
[02:07:47.683 --> 02:07:48.104]  Hello, Walt.
[02:07:48.144 --> 02:07:48.424]  Welcome.
[02:08:15.928 --> 02:08:16.248]  Yeah.
[02:08:16.728 --> 02:08:23.771]  You had a guy two or three days ago who said he had some maps of the Mississippi and New Orleans that showed it was going to be flooded.
[02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:27.012]  Was that under Agenda 21, those maps that he had?
[02:08:29.153 --> 02:08:29.473]  Yes.
[02:08:29.813 --> 02:08:33.495]  I know that openly they want to turn that area into wetlands.
[02:08:34.215 --> 02:08:36.576]  They want to break dams all over the country.
[02:08:37.716 --> 02:08:43.298]  Basically, it's a way to force us into compact cities, and then the elite openly will live in these big...
[02:08:46.224 --> 02:08:51.928]  Are those maps available where we can download them or get copies of them or something where we can have...
[02:09:11.975 --> 02:09:25.164]  Well, I mean, USA Today about three weeks ago had a front page story about rewilding the Midwest.
[02:09:26.785 --> 02:09:36.571]  And they're actually considering releasing lions and tigers and elephants, saying that because 20,000 years ago they were here, we need to do it again.
[02:09:37.291 --> 02:09:38.692]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[02:09:38.732 --> 02:09:41.194]  They're releasing cougars, mountain lions all over.
[02:09:41.829 --> 02:09:45.532]  I went and downloaded Agenda 21 last night, the whole thing.
[02:09:45.553 --> 02:09:48.575]  I'm going to put it on disk, and I printed it out last night.
[02:09:48.896 --> 02:09:50.477]  It's about 350 to 500 pages long.
[02:09:51.618 --> 02:09:52.639]  And I'll tell you something.
[02:09:52.659 --> 02:09:54.160]  These guys are monsters, Alex.
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:54.921]  They're evil.
[02:09:55.161 --> 02:09:57.804]  Well, I mean, and that's just one UN plan.
[02:09:57.824 --> 02:10:03.589]  They have a whole bunch of different roadmaps that are all interlocked and simultaneously being implemented.
[02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:06.392]  And when they sign NAFTA or they sign GATT,
[02:10:06.972 --> 02:10:14.778]  Or they sign a CAFTA, or when they sign a deal, it all mentions these plans.
[02:10:14.958 --> 02:10:18.361]  When the globalists write their plan, the CFR writes a plan.
[02:10:18.961 --> 02:10:20.662]  And it is implemented.
[02:10:20.763 --> 02:10:24.005]  It is brought in, and it is horrible.
[02:10:24.045 --> 02:10:24.725]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:25.506 --> 02:10:27.147]  Really good points that you brought up there.
[02:10:28.228 --> 02:10:33.492]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Georgia, who just got back from Louisiana.
[02:10:33.792 --> 02:10:34.673]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:10:35.385 --> 02:10:36.345]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:10:36.665 --> 02:10:37.106]  Thank you.
[02:10:37.946 --> 02:10:39.606]  Listen, I just want to make a point.
[02:10:39.666 --> 02:10:49.129]  I know we've heard, especially patriots around the nation, the sound or you explaining what it's going to be like in a police state.
[02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:59.652]  I'll tell you, I went down there last Friday because I had no idea the damage to my home in Covington, Louisiana and the damage to my office in the neighboring town of Mandeville.
[02:11:00.073 --> 02:11:02.073]  I went down there with my cousin.
[02:11:02.093 --> 02:11:02.853]  We both had guns.
[02:11:05.461 --> 02:11:11.544]  I tell you what, there's no power and the first night we stayed there, it became real to me.
[02:11:11.584 --> 02:11:16.507]  Just all the things that I've heard and read in the last year or two, it became real to me.
[02:11:16.567 --> 02:11:17.947]  Can you imagine?
[02:11:18.147 --> 02:11:19.668]  There's no power.
[02:11:19.708 --> 02:11:21.909]  It's pitch black.
[02:11:22.169 --> 02:11:23.390]  I live in a nice neighborhood.
[02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:25.871]  Obviously, there's no power.
[02:11:25.891 --> 02:11:26.852]  There's trees down everywhere.
[02:11:27.852 --> 02:11:29.753]  Fortunately, I was protected by God.
[02:11:29.793 --> 02:11:31.274]  It wasn't damaged.
[02:11:31.784 --> 02:11:40.151]  Anyway, I'm laying in my bed, and it's about, I don't know, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock in the morning, and the windows are wide open, you know, so I can let the air in because it's hot.
[02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:51.220]  And pitch black, and all you hear every, I don't know, 30 minutes is the thumping, thunderous sound of a military helicopter off in the distance.
[02:11:52.182 --> 02:11:55.765]  Slowly, ominously, getting closer and closer and closer.
[02:11:55.825 --> 02:11:59.207]  And again, never in our history has stuff like this happened to this degree.
[02:11:59.227 --> 02:12:00.128]  Sure, sure.
[02:12:00.228 --> 02:12:05.591]  But all we heard was martial law, and then magically the reasons start appearing.
[02:12:05.952 --> 02:12:08.213]  The terrorists, and then it's the government.
[02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:10.495]  The terrorists in England, it's the government.
[02:12:10.515 --> 02:12:13.937]  Shining spotlights through, and I'm in a neighborhood that there's no looting.
[02:12:14.177 --> 02:12:18.961]  There's a police officer, not just a rent-a-cop, but actually a police officer up front, gated community.
[02:12:19.021 --> 02:12:20.682]  Oh, so they're shining lights on you.
[02:12:21.018 --> 02:12:24.719]  There were shining lights just throughout the woods and whatnot.
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:29.521]  I don't know what they're looking for, but it made it real to me.
[02:12:29.601 --> 02:12:33.443]  I just was like, man, I'm going to make sure my gun is closed.
[02:12:33.483 --> 02:12:34.963]  Who knows what they're going to do.
[02:12:34.983 --> 02:12:40.526]  Did you know that we've caught FEMA as well as the National Forestry Service and others?
[02:12:40.546 --> 02:12:49.049]  There was a big article in the San Francisco Chronicle where the city itself stole 900 acres and big houses and
[02:12:49.967 --> 02:13:00.762]  Now the local bureaucrats live in the homes, rent-free, ride the four-wheelers, live in the life, and bureaucrats are going to be getting a lot of the property out there.
[02:13:02.164 --> 02:13:04.147]  They're also just assessing the goodies.
[02:13:04.828 --> 02:13:05.008]  Yes.
[02:13:05.741 --> 02:13:06.402]  I can imagine.
[02:13:06.582 --> 02:13:07.522]  I can imagine.
[02:13:07.783 --> 02:13:08.983]  Hey, look, folks, that isn't a joke.
[02:13:09.023 --> 02:13:18.630]  I mean, we have hundreds of reports where the cops pull over an 80-year-old lady who's got five grand in her purse because she doesn't trust banks, and they just take it from her and say, prove it in drug money.
[02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:20.571]  You know, it's called asset forfeiture seizure.
[02:13:20.891 --> 02:13:23.153]  And this is all just being normalized, see?
[02:13:24.273 --> 02:13:25.134]  You know what?
[02:13:26.395 --> 02:13:29.977]  We have a sponsor who sells the nuclear.
[02:13:30.518 --> 02:13:32.379]  Big patriotic, you know, pro-Bush guy.
[02:13:34.163 --> 02:13:39.286]  He tried to deliver a whole truckload of MREs, and they just confiscated the truck and the MREs.
[02:13:39.306 --> 02:13:40.607]  That's what I was told by his office.
[02:13:41.667 --> 02:13:59.896]  Five minutes down from my exit, as you get down, actually it's about 15 minutes, when you get towards Slidell, I mean, every exit when I was leaving on Sunday was manned by police, and arm-in-arm with them were M16 Toten, National Guardsmen, military, whatever.
[02:14:00.216 --> 02:14:01.437]  And again, all they're doing...
[02:14:02.302 --> 02:14:06.606]  All they're doing is showing their authority and the authority to not aid the people.
[02:14:06.666 --> 02:14:07.266]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:07.887 --> 02:14:14.853]  And five days into it, we shamed them so bad that they had to allow aid in.
[02:14:16.454 --> 02:14:19.476]  I mean, don't miss the forest for the trees, folks.
[02:14:20.317 --> 02:14:21.538]  I mean, this is just pure evil.
[02:14:22.159 --> 02:14:27.163]  We're going to go to more of your calls after I get into FEMA and some of the things they're doing criminally.
[02:14:28.996 --> 02:14:30.217]  And we'll do that in the next segment.
[02:14:30.237 --> 02:14:40.182]  But here in the next three minutes, I'm honored to have Ted Anderson on with us because we've been getting calls into the board asking if we're still running that special that he announced last week.
[02:14:41.043 --> 02:14:43.284]  This is the gold price from two weeks ago.
[02:14:44.485 --> 02:14:51.389]  He's almost out at this price, those $5 gold pieces, those quarter ounces for $165.
[02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:53.770]  I mean, that is a great deal.
[02:14:54.291 --> 02:14:55.251]  They have them on hand.
[02:14:55.271 --> 02:14:56.632]  They'll ship them right out to you.
[02:14:57.410 --> 02:15:05.618]  I mean, even major mainstream banking outfits are now saying gold is probably going to go over $700 an ounce.
[02:15:06.459 --> 02:15:07.420]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:15:07.921 --> 02:15:08.521]  It doesn't matter.
[02:15:08.561 --> 02:15:09.743]  It's a real commodity.
[02:15:10.263 --> 02:15:13.026]  It can't be devalued massively like paper currency.
[02:15:13.306 --> 02:15:14.908]  And he also has a silver dollar...
[02:15:15.928 --> 02:15:16.689]  We're good to go.
[02:15:35.447 --> 02:15:37.588]  They're trading at $165 apiece.
[02:15:37.628 --> 02:15:41.170]  You can pick them up that way or you can get them at $3,300 per roll.
[02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:45.532]  We're all seeing what's going on with the economics around the oil prices and everything.
[02:15:45.592 --> 02:15:47.313]  I mean, it's really shaking up the economy.
[02:15:47.813 --> 02:15:57.677]  The second thing is that one of the most popular items in silver, hands down, are the silver dollars that we use here as money here in the United States.
[02:15:58.017 --> 02:16:03.480]  You put one of those silver dollars in somebody's hand, their eyes gleam, they light up, they know there's value there.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:08.084]  These things trade on eBay $15 to $20 a piece all day long.
[02:16:08.745 --> 02:16:11.708]  What I have is I have them in quantity available.
[02:16:11.728 --> 02:16:13.230]  They're $12.75 a piece.
[02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:14.431]  This is the way that it works out.
[02:16:14.831 --> 02:16:16.853]  They're $12.75 per coin.
[02:16:17.234 --> 02:16:20.978]  You can pick up in increments of rolls at $255 per roll.
[02:16:23.743 --> 02:16:25.726]  Now that's a roll of 20 coins.
[02:16:26.267 --> 02:16:30.292]  Or what I'd suggest that you do is you pick them up in the quarter bag increments.
[02:16:30.352 --> 02:16:31.874]  Quarter bags mean $250 face value at $3,188 per bag.
[02:16:31.894 --> 02:16:33.417]  And by the way, silver is only going up in value.
[02:16:39.605 --> 02:16:39.965]  Oh, yeah.
[02:16:40.205 --> 02:16:43.267]  Actually, gold and silver are both up since the last time we were on the air.
[02:16:43.508 --> 02:16:45.389]  Silver right now is at $7.07.
[02:16:45.449 --> 02:16:47.470]  Last time we were on the air, it was $6.80.
[02:16:48.011 --> 02:16:50.552]  Obviously, the silver dollars are going to be increasing in price.
[02:16:50.952 --> 02:16:53.334]  You also have gold right now at $4.40, $4.50.
[02:16:53.834 --> 02:16:58.717]  So they're both really in a good position to be getting involved with the silver dollars.
[02:16:59.098 --> 02:17:00.999]  Again, a really good offer.
[02:17:01.339 --> 02:17:05.402]  People need to have some silver on hand, too, and there's just nothing that's more...
[02:17:06.603 --> 02:17:13.590]  Barterable or more, what should I say, recognizable than the old silver dollars that were actually... Well, there's nothing more liquid.
[02:17:13.970 --> 02:17:15.131]  Yeah, they're very liquid.
[02:17:15.171 --> 02:17:16.272]  They're very easy to sell.
[02:17:16.292 --> 02:17:20.797]  Let me get the number out and tell them it's an Alex Jones special when you call to take advantage of the...
[02:17:21.801 --> 02:17:22.882]  Gold or the silver.
[02:17:23.503 --> 02:17:24.844]  And folks, this is the time to buy.
[02:17:24.864 --> 02:17:26.865]  1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 And when this deal's gone, it's gone.
[02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:34.392]  Because when these supplies are gone, it's all going to be the new price because it's going up.
[02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:35.953]  1-800-686-2237 Thanks for coming on, Ted.
[02:17:35.973 --> 02:17:36.634]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:17:45.856 --> 02:17:52.921]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:17:54.182 --> 02:17:58.244]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:17:58.965 --> 02:18:06.009]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:15.656]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[02:18:47.839 --> 02:18:48.880]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:49.201 --> 02:18:52.004]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:52.265 --> 02:18:56.430]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.850 --> 02:18:57.692]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.992 --> 02:19:02.558]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:03.038 --> 02:19:05.179]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:05.659 --> 02:19:20.365]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:19:47.737 --> 02:19:48.798]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:49.199 --> 02:19:54.684]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:55.245 --> 02:19:55.745]  That's right.
[02:19:56.065 --> 02:19:58.348]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:58.908 --> 02:20:05.835]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:06.391 --> 02:20:07.472]  We're good to go.
[02:20:25.806 --> 02:20:26.066]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.312 --> 02:20:49.355]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[02:20:49.595 --> 02:20:55.240]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:20:55.540 --> 02:21:01.406]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:21:01.526 --> 02:21:07.491]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:21:07.811 --> 02:21:11.493]  One packet of Gano Cafe is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[02:21:11.673 --> 02:21:16.476]  All-natural Gano Cafe tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.

[02:21:41.969 --> 02:21:43.649]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:43.769 --> 02:21:51.732]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.709 --> 02:22:00.491]  I'm going to give it to FEMA right now, then we'll come back and take some calls.
[02:22:01.791 --> 02:22:05.993]  But I know I gave that number out really quick there in the last 15 seconds of the last segment.
[02:22:06.634 --> 02:22:14.477]  You want to call and take advantage of this deal on these collector's item silver dollars that are pretty close to their melt value for what they're being sold for.
[02:22:14.497 --> 02:22:19.980]  I have seen these silver dollars on eBay, you know, $15, $20 a piece.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:20.961]  So this is a good deal.
[02:22:21.581 --> 02:22:23.022]  And they also have a collector's value.
[02:22:23.082 --> 02:22:24.502]  It's pure silver, 1920s, beautiful coins.
[02:22:26.278 --> 02:22:27.218]  A great deal on those.
[02:22:27.238 --> 02:22:30.759]  You can buy them single or you can buy whole rolls or bags.
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:33.760]  That's what the Elite's doing.
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:44.843]  You can also get those quarter ounce $5 gold pieces that are very close to just their gold value and they even have a collector's value to them as well.
[02:22:45.984 --> 02:22:47.844]  These are great deals.
[02:22:48.024 --> 02:22:50.245]  I've shopped around for gold and I buy from Ted Anderson.
[02:22:50.285 --> 02:22:50.505]  In fact,
[02:22:51.295 --> 02:22:56.220]  A few months ago, I bought some more gold, and I'm going to be buying a little bit more today, maybe even some silver dollars.
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:57.801]  It's just a good investment.
[02:22:57.841 --> 02:23:02.525]  I mean, the value of the dollar has gone down by 45% in the last three years.
[02:23:03.626 --> 02:23:12.654]  And so I've taken a little bit of college savings I've got for my children, and I put it into gold because I'm not rolling in great accrued wealth here.
[02:23:12.754 --> 02:23:18.359]  But I know this, the little bit of cash I had that I left in the bank too long is just basically, it's getting more and more worthless.
[02:23:19.259 --> 02:23:20.559]  I mean, $100 is like $60.
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:24.741]  Really, $100 is like $55.
[02:23:24.841 --> 02:23:29.902]  I mean, that should make you really mad, folks.
[02:23:30.723 --> 02:23:32.643]  So you've still got time to put it into gold.
[02:23:33.423 --> 02:23:35.304]  And I don't know.
[02:23:35.364 --> 02:23:38.765]  I mean, I hear all the big announcements now where all the big banks are saying buy gold.
[02:23:39.341 --> 02:23:41.563]  You don't want to wait until the big rush is on.
[02:23:41.924 --> 02:23:44.286]  Give them a call right now and tell them it's the Alex Jones Special.
[02:23:44.306 --> 02:23:44.426]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:44.446 --> 02:23:44.666]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:44.706 --> 02:23:45.727]  Silver dollars and $5 gold pieces.
[02:23:45.747 --> 02:23:45.967]  All right.
[02:23:45.987 --> 02:23:46.127]  FEMA...
[02:23:59.989 --> 02:24:04.350]  Deliberately sabotaging hurricane relief efforts by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:05.470]  That's one article.
[02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:06.690]  And another one by Steve Watson.
[02:24:07.011 --> 02:24:10.611]  FEMA executive orders pave the way for emerging police state held.
[02:24:11.111 --> 02:24:17.253]  And another article that chronologically lists all of the provocateuring and terrorism that FEMA is engaging in.
[02:24:17.273 --> 02:24:19.513]  I mean, there's so much of this, it's hard to cover it all.
[02:24:19.533 --> 02:24:20.633]  But this is the big story.
[02:24:20.653 --> 02:24:22.934]  This is the story that's being ignored right now.
[02:24:24.358 --> 02:24:29.187]  FEMA deliberately sabotaging hurricane relief efforts.
[02:24:29.849 --> 02:24:31.512]  Multiple parishes revolt.
[02:24:32.233 --> 02:24:35.018]  Use armed guards to defend against feds.
[02:24:36.423 --> 02:24:44.547]  Numerous credible sources have come forward with examples of how the Federal Emergency Management Agency is deliberately sabotaging Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in New Orleans.
[02:24:44.587 --> 02:24:54.191]  This represents a ruthless attempt on the part of FEMA to impose a federal takeover of the area for their own benefit amid the tragedy that has already claimed anything up to 10,000 lives.
[02:24:54.731 --> 02:25:02.274]  The mainstream media has picked up on the story but is whitewashing it as just another failure of the government in dealing with the crisis.
[02:25:03.295 --> 02:25:03.995]  Excuse me.
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:15.527]  In reality, the actions are part of a coordinated campaign to deepen the scope of the disaster in order to force through bumper funding increases for FEMA.
[02:25:16.227 --> 02:25:25.554]  Jefferson Parish President Aaron Bouchard, we played yesterday, appeared on Meet the Press Sunday and broke down in tears as he described FEMA's criminal activities.
[02:25:26.634 --> 02:25:28.555]  We have been abandoned by our own country.
[02:25:28.596 --> 02:25:33.719]  Hurricane Katrina will go down in history as one of the worst storms ever to hit the American coast.
[02:25:34.332 --> 02:25:42.335]  The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will go down as one of the worst abandonments of Americans on American soil ever in U.S.
[02:25:42.355 --> 02:25:43.176]  history, he said.
[02:25:43.216 --> 02:25:50.639]  He continued by saying tearfully, We had Walmart deliver three trucks of water, trailer trucks of water.
[02:25:51.039 --> 02:25:52.259]  FEMA turned them back.
[02:25:52.819 --> 02:25:54.200]  They said we didn't need them.
[02:25:54.972 --> 02:25:56.733]  This was a week ago, FEMA.
[02:25:57.194 --> 02:26:02.718]  We had a thousand gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish.
[02:26:03.198 --> 02:26:06.881]  The Coast Guard said, come get the fuel right away.
[02:26:07.282 --> 02:26:10.624]  When we got there with our trucks, they got a word.
[02:26:10.944 --> 02:26:12.866]  FEMA says, don't give you the fuel.
[02:26:13.386 --> 02:26:18.410]  Yesterday, yesterday, FEMA comes in and cuts off our emergency communications lines.
[02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:20.131]  They cut them without notice.
[02:26:20.472 --> 02:26:21.973]  Our Sheriff Harry Lee goes back.
[02:26:22.493 --> 02:26:23.894]  And he reconnects the lines.
[02:26:24.195 --> 02:26:28.338]  He posts armed guards on the line and says no one is getting near the lines.
[02:26:28.798 --> 02:26:30.660]  The head of our local emergency management.
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:32.761]  I don't have the quotes here, but I'm going off memory.
[02:26:33.062 --> 02:26:36.024]  The head of emergency management, his mother was stuck.
[02:26:36.404 --> 02:26:39.567]  He said, Mama, they're coming to get you on Monday.
[02:26:40.227 --> 02:26:42.129]  Mama, they're coming to get you on Tuesday.
[02:26:42.981 --> 02:26:45.343]  Mama, they're coming to get your wisdom.
[02:26:45.703 --> 02:26:47.545]  Mama, they're coming to get your wisdom.
[02:26:47.565 --> 02:26:49.506]  Friday, Mama, they're coming to get you.
[02:26:49.726 --> 02:26:51.047]  Friday, she drowned.
[02:26:51.267 --> 02:26:51.888]  She drowned.
[02:26:51.908 --> 02:26:52.949]  They're never coming.
[02:26:53.129 --> 02:26:53.950]  They're not coming.
[02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:55.651]  I'm sick of seeing jerked off.
[02:26:56.051 --> 02:26:58.593]  Sick of seeing jerked off on the news or the press conferences.
[02:26:58.773 --> 02:27:00.234]  We're sick of the press conferences.
[02:27:00.394 --> 02:27:01.635]  Get in there and save them.
[02:27:01.796 --> 02:27:03.157]  You're not saving them now.
[02:27:03.317 --> 02:27:04.618]  You're not doing nothing.
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:08.901]  So that's why I'm starting to be in a couple movies.
[02:27:08.921 --> 02:27:09.902]  All right, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:27:10.042 --> 02:27:12.644]  I'm trying to have some fun out of all this, but it's horrible.
[02:27:13.306 --> 02:27:14.146]  I mean, it's a nightmare.
[02:27:14.246 --> 02:27:17.067]  I should just play the clip instead of trying to imitate it.
[02:27:17.907 --> 02:27:18.787]  But it's horrible.
[02:27:18.807 --> 02:27:19.568]  It makes you cry.
[02:27:20.608 --> 02:27:23.809]  And you know what?
[02:27:23.889 --> 02:27:25.309]  Cue up that clip.
[02:27:26.269 --> 02:27:27.230]  It's a four-minute clip, though.
[02:27:27.250 --> 02:27:28.270]  Let's just play the last two minutes.
[02:27:28.310 --> 02:27:28.870]  It's too long.
[02:27:29.730 --> 02:27:30.050]  Cue it up.
[02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:31.571]  We're just talking about the hooves approaching.
[02:27:32.151 --> 02:27:33.071]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.091 --> 02:27:34.652]  We'll actually play him doing it instead of me.
[02:27:36.432 --> 02:27:37.332]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.813 --> 02:27:39.313]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.329 --> 02:27:43.008]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.252 --> 02:27:49.633]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:27:49.873 --> 02:27:50.213]  Why?
[02:27:50.233 --> 02:27:53.154]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:48.211]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.351 --> 02:28:52.454]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.594 --> 02:28:55.476]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.556 --> 02:29:02.281]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.461 --> 02:29:05.463]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.663 --> 02:29:08.044]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:08.164 --> 02:29:10.446]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[02:29:10.486 --> 02:29:10.966]  We're good to go.
[02:29:10.986 --> 02:29:11.447]  We're good to go.
[02:29:37.930 --> 02:29:39.676]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:47.090 --> 02:29:53.132]  We continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[02:29:53.352 --> 02:29:58.374]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.694 --> 02:30:06.597]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.737 --> 02:30:13.779]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:13.999 --> 02:30:15.220]  There are no side effects.

[02:30:34.288 --> 02:30:35.249]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:46.221 --> 02:31:05.867]  No, but I mean, you hear these type of passion and please, impassioned please, now, inventing new words, I've got ebonics, and it just makes you really, really mad.
[02:31:07.527 --> 02:31:09.447]  FEMA in their cutting of the lines.
[02:31:11.448 --> 02:31:14.669]  Why would FEMA, an organization supposedly tasked with helping
[02:31:15.589 --> 02:31:19.251]  In a time of crisis, deliberately cut police communications lines.
[02:31:19.671 --> 02:31:24.693]  This is a blatant example of sabotage and a sick push to make the disaster worse.
[02:31:25.154 --> 02:31:31.757]  In carrying out these actions, FEMA is no better than the animals who shot at rescue workers in helicopters.
[02:31:33.095 --> 02:31:39.020]  The mission of FEMA has never in reality been to bring people food and water and in times of crisis.
[02:31:39.721 --> 02:31:48.528]  Alex Jones has attended numerous FEMA drills where the whole point of the exercise is to round people up, break up families, and institute a brutal police state crackdown.
[02:31:49.909 --> 02:31:58.677]  FEMA needs to create a chaotic atmosphere in New Orleans so they can legitimize what they are doing.
[02:32:00.433 --> 02:32:08.499]  We now have multiple reports of police being ordered to guard key infrastructures in order to defend them from FEMA federal agents.
[02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:13.683]  Sheriffs in numerous different counties are guarding highways to keep out FEMA.
[02:32:14.283 --> 02:32:24.151]  FEMA is being treated as the enemy because they are sabotaging key facilities in an effort to intentionally worsen the already desperate scenes of horror in New Orleans.
[02:32:24.736 --> 02:32:33.379]  FEMA is sabotaging lines of communication so their activities cannot be exposed to the wider relief authorities and the media.
[02:32:35.739 --> 02:32:41.561]  Commenting on the sabotage by FEMA of communications lines, Washington insider Wayne Madison, former NSA foe.
[02:32:42.392 --> 02:32:53.316]  National Security Agency said, Jamming radio and other communications, such as television signals, is part of a Pentagon tactic called information blockade or technology blockade.
[02:32:53.876 --> 02:33:04.239]  The tactic is one of a number of such operations that are part of the doctrine of information warfare and is one of the psychological operations of PSYOPs methods used by the U.S.
[02:33:04.259 --> 02:33:06.060]  Special Forces Operations Command.
[02:33:07.344 --> 02:33:22.207]  Radio host Carol Baker, who has been tracking FEMA sabotage, stated that the Plow Mains parish sheriff, Joe Engel, we did confirm that in a local news article, had his deputies patrol the county line under orders not to let FEMA in.
[02:33:23.047 --> 02:33:32.989]  As is discussed in the Meet the Press interview with Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee, also has armed guards patrolling the county line in order to prevent the FEMA sabotage.
[02:33:33.539 --> 02:33:37.980]  FEMA has a number of executive orders that outline the total federal takeover of any U.S.
[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:38.301]  city.
[02:33:39.481 --> 02:33:49.764]  FEMA is clearly using the human catastrophe as a means of executing its decades-long plans of providing the pretext for further takeover scenarios of all major American cities.
[02:33:50.344 --> 02:33:52.545]  Amongst a litany of government inaction and outright
[02:33:53.231 --> 02:33:54.412]  Dereliction of duty.
[02:33:54.472 --> 02:34:05.938]  This is the most alarming evidence to emerge yet that clearly indicates an agenda for the federal government to profit and expand its power from exploiting the aftermath of the hurricane.
[02:34:07.799 --> 02:34:18.606]  And here's the clip that we played yesterday, but I know that we had some satellite trouble or internet trouble there in the first few hours.
[02:34:18.626 --> 02:34:19.746]  Some of you may not have heard it.
[02:34:20.247 --> 02:34:22.348]  We'll play this clip with the
[02:34:23.606 --> 02:34:31.011]  Parish President, basically the Mayor, talking about just the horrible things that FEMA was doing.
[02:34:31.891 --> 02:34:36.073]  I've got a whole other report here with just dozens of other examples of this.
[02:34:36.514 --> 02:34:38.575]  It's on presentplanet.com right now, but here it is.
[02:34:40.993 --> 02:34:47.556]  Sir, they were told, like me, every single day, the Calvary's coming on a federal level.
[02:34:47.836 --> 02:34:48.856]  The Calvary's coming.
[02:34:49.116 --> 02:34:50.137]  The Calvary's coming.
[02:34:50.417 --> 02:34:51.437]  The Calvary's coming.
[02:34:52.037 --> 02:34:55.659]  I have just begun to hear the hoofs of the Calvary.
[02:34:55.899 --> 02:35:01.401]  The Calvary's still not here yet, but I've begun to hear the hoofs, and we're almost a week out.
[02:35:01.461 --> 02:35:03.222]  Let me give you just three quick examples.
[02:35:03.642 --> 02:35:07.964]  We had Walmart deliver three trucks of water, trailer trucks of water.
[02:35:08.064 --> 02:35:09.245]  FEMA turned them back.
[02:35:09.585 --> 02:35:10.725]  They said we didn't need them.
[02:35:10.985 --> 02:35:11.986]  This was a week ago.
[02:35:12.886 --> 02:35:19.609]  FEMA, we had a thousand gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish.
[02:35:19.809 --> 02:35:22.090]  The Coast Guard said, come get the fuel right away.
[02:35:22.391 --> 02:35:24.612]  When we got there with our trucks, they got a word.
[02:35:24.732 --> 02:35:26.492]  FEMA says, don't give you the fuel.
[02:35:26.853 --> 02:35:29.934]  Yesterday, yesterday, FEMA comes in and cuts
[02:35:30.374 --> 02:35:34.160]  All of our emergency communication lines, they cut them without notice.
[02:35:34.821 --> 02:35:42.391]  Our sheriff, Harry Lee, goes back in, he reconnects the line, he posts armed guards on our line and says, no one's getting near these lines.
[02:35:42.692 --> 02:35:45.576]  Sheriff Harry Lee said that if America...
[02:35:46.076 --> 02:35:49.418]  American government would have responded like Walmart has responded.
[02:35:49.718 --> 02:35:51.039]  We wouldn't be in this crisis.
[02:35:51.079 --> 02:35:55.202]  But I want to thank Governor Blanco for all she's done and all her leadership.
[02:35:55.242 --> 02:35:56.603]  She's sent in the National Guard.
[02:35:56.963 --> 02:36:02.606]  I just repaired a breach on my side of the 17th Street Canal that the Secretary didn't foresee.
[02:36:02.887 --> 02:36:04.007]  A 300-foot breach.
[02:36:04.327 --> 02:36:06.649]  I just completed it yesterday with convoys.
[02:36:07.009 --> 02:36:10.693]  Of National Guard and local parish workers and levy board people.
[02:36:10.993 --> 02:36:13.555]  It took us two and a half days working 24-7.
[02:36:13.876 --> 02:36:15.037]  I just closed it.
[02:36:15.457 --> 02:36:19.981]  I'm telling you, most importantly, I want to thank my public employees that have worked 24-7.
[02:36:20.001 --> 02:36:21.463]  They're burnt out.
[02:36:21.523 --> 02:36:22.664]  The doctors, the nurses.
[02:36:22.964 --> 02:36:26.608]  And I want to give you one last story and I'll shut up and let you tell me whatever you want to tell me.
[02:36:27.228 --> 02:36:32.230]  The guy who runs this building I'm in, Emergency Management, he's responsible for everything.
[02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:34.790]  His mother was trapped in St.
[02:36:34.810 --> 02:36:35.851]  Bernard Nursing Home.
[02:36:36.291 --> 02:36:40.132]  And every day she called him and said, Are you coming, son?
[02:36:40.472 --> 02:36:41.492]  Is somebody coming?
[02:36:41.973 --> 02:36:43.093]  And he said, Yeah, mama.
[02:36:43.493 --> 02:36:45.034]  Somebody's coming to get you.
[02:36:45.574 --> 02:36:47.755]  Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday.
[02:36:48.055 --> 02:36:49.796]  Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday.
[02:36:50.456 --> 02:36:52.357]  Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday.
[02:36:52.917 --> 02:36:54.898]  Somebody's coming to get you on Friday.
[02:36:55.338 --> 02:36:56.339]  And she drowned it.
[02:36:56.699 --> 02:36:57.579]  Friday night.
[02:36:58.219 --> 02:36:59.100]  She drowned it.
[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:01.621]  Friday night.
[02:37:02.501 --> 02:37:03.882]  Nobody's coming to get her.
[02:37:04.632 --> 02:37:06.853]  Nobody's coming to get us.
[02:37:06.893 --> 02:37:08.293]  The Secretary has promised.
[02:37:08.473 --> 02:37:09.613]  Everybody's promised.
[02:37:10.093 --> 02:37:12.154]  They've had press conferences.
[02:37:12.374 --> 02:37:14.014]  I'm sick of the press conferences.
[02:37:14.534 --> 02:37:17.755]  For God's sakes, shut up and send us somebody.
[02:37:19.115 --> 02:37:24.316]  Just take a pause, Mr. President, while you gather yourself in your very emotional times, I understand.
[02:37:24.676 --> 02:37:26.797]  Let me go to Governor Haley Barber of Mississippi.
[02:37:27.317 --> 02:37:31.258]  Governor Barber, can you bring our audience up to date on what is happening in your state?
[02:37:31.598 --> 02:37:31.918]  How many...
[02:37:33.414 --> 02:37:34.635]  Governor Bob.
[02:37:34.655 --> 02:37:39.679]  I just think the president's done an incredible job.
[02:37:39.699 --> 02:37:40.380]  That's how he talks.
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:43.242]  And, you know, certainly it's a tragedy.
[02:37:43.402 --> 02:37:46.365]  I mean, it's just pathetic.
[02:37:47.225 --> 02:37:55.272]  And then understand Chertoff, who literally looks like some type of demonic apparition, he's fluttering around in the background while all this is going on.
[02:37:57.394 --> 02:37:59.055]  His eyes are drinking it up.
[02:38:00.156 --> 02:38:02.137]  It's sick, but you've got to laugh at a certain point.
[02:38:02.197 --> 02:38:02.738]  I mean, it's just...
[02:38:03.408 --> 02:38:04.289]  It's so crazy.
[02:38:05.289 --> 02:38:11.332]  Understand, if things went well there, they wouldn't have the pretext to get more funds, more control, all of this.
[02:38:11.392 --> 02:38:12.693]  But I think it's blowing up in their face.
[02:38:14.314 --> 02:38:16.175]  But see, it's also a diversion now.
[02:38:16.215 --> 02:38:17.636]  We're not talking about Iraq anymore.
[02:38:18.376 --> 02:38:20.057]  We're not talking about all the corruption.
[02:38:20.077 --> 02:38:27.641]  We're not talking about how we kind of reached that tipping point with really exposing the phony war.
[02:38:29.466 --> 02:38:38.312]  Now there's this image, and we've got to dig deep and fund the military more because they're fighting Al-Qaeda and saving us in Louisiana.
[02:38:39.893 --> 02:38:43.876]  FEMA executive orders pave the way for emergency police state hell.
[02:38:43.956 --> 02:38:52.722]  In the wake of the unfolding police state crisis in New Orleans and the federal coup d'etat of all constitutional laws there, it begs the question, how could this happen?
[02:38:52.742 --> 02:38:58.886]  The answer lies with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the multiple executive orders that have gradually and gradually
[02:39:01.045 --> 02:39:04.066]  Continually eroded away all aspects of the U.S.
[02:39:04.106 --> 02:39:05.486]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:39:05.926 --> 02:39:10.387]  It is FEMA that is handling everything and systematically implementing the police state.
[02:39:10.407 --> 02:39:14.368]  It is FEMA who is really calling the shots and setting priorities here.
[02:39:14.408 --> 02:39:17.829]  Lieutenant General Earl A. Shrook, Commander of the U.S.
[02:39:17.869 --> 02:39:21.189]  Army Corps of Engineers, has said on the events in New Orleans.
[02:39:21.309 --> 02:39:24.630]  And that's just what the former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury said.
[02:39:25.426 --> 02:39:27.974]  I mean, that's who ran the thing from day one, folks.
[02:39:28.315 --> 02:39:32.006]  They can try to blame on the locals and say we need more federal control, but the feds did this.
[02:39:32.634 --> 02:39:38.218]  So let us look at how FEMA has paved the way for the emerging police state hell.
[02:39:38.779 --> 02:39:40.039]  FEMA is not an elected body.
[02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:42.201]  It does not involve itself in public disclosures.
[02:39:42.621 --> 02:39:45.944]  And it even has a quasi-secret budget in the billions of dollars.
[02:39:46.384 --> 02:39:49.386]  It has more power than the President of the United States or the Congress.
[02:39:49.727 --> 02:39:56.391]  It has the power to suspend laws, move entire populations, arrest and detain citizens without a warrant, and hold them without trial.
[02:39:56.452 --> 02:39:58.233]  It can seize property, food supplies...
[02:39:58.713 --> 02:40:00.414]  And again, it's practicing what it does.
[02:40:00.514 --> 02:40:05.838]  Not helping, enslaving transportation systems and can suspend the Constitution.
[02:40:06.278 --> 02:40:12.403]  Not only is it the most powerful entity in the United States, but it was not even created under constitutional law by the Congress.
[02:40:12.443 --> 02:40:14.944]  No, it was created by trilateralist Jimmy Carter.
[02:40:15.705 --> 02:40:20.528]  A series of executive orders dating back from the 1960s onwards underlines the history of FEMA.
[02:40:20.948 --> 02:40:23.270]  And again, before it was known as FEMA, it already existed.
[02:40:24.443 --> 02:40:29.224]  The plan for total control of every aspect of our lives has been under construction for a long time.
[02:40:29.684 --> 02:40:34.625]  Below are just some of the executive orders relating to FEMA.
[02:40:34.705 --> 02:40:38.666]  As you read them, bear in mind that they mean nothing by themselves.
[02:40:39.026 --> 02:40:43.787]  They are not law, nor can they become law by and of themselves.
[02:40:44.707 --> 02:40:49.268]  Executive Order Number 12148, created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[02:40:49.921 --> 02:40:55.064]  To interface with the Department of Defense for civil defense planning and funding.
[02:40:55.204 --> 02:40:57.026]  Again, they created it with the president who signs it.
[02:40:57.626 --> 02:40:59.707]  The emergency czar was appointed.
[02:40:59.767 --> 02:41:03.890]  FEMA has only spent about 6% of its budget on national emergencies.
[02:41:04.310 --> 02:41:11.935]  The bulk of their funding has been used for the construction of secret underground facilities to assure continuity of government in case of a major emergency.
[02:41:11.995 --> 02:41:14.857]  Really, they plan and prepare to fight revolutions, folks.
[02:41:15.945 --> 02:41:16.545]  We're good to go.
[02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:40.111]  The Executive Order No.
[02:41:40.411 --> 02:41:47.857]  12656 appointed the National Security Council as the principal body that should consider emergency powers.
[02:41:48.317 --> 02:41:51.239]  This allows the government to increase domestic intelligence and surveillance of U.S.
[02:41:51.279 --> 02:41:57.584]  citizens and would restrict the freedom of movement within the United States and grant the government the right to isolate large groups of civilians.
[02:41:57.604 --> 02:42:01.647]  The National Guard could be federalized to seal all borders and take control of U.S.
[02:42:01.708 --> 02:42:03.469]  airspace and all ports of entry.
[02:42:05.146 --> 02:42:11.451]  Executive Order 10990 allows the government to take control of all modes of transportation to control the highways and seaports.
[02:42:11.551 --> 02:42:13.673]  And again, sounds good if they could be trusted.
[02:42:14.013 --> 02:42:14.534]  They can't be.
[02:42:14.574 --> 02:42:17.016]  Government never will help you and won't help you and can't help you.
[02:42:17.589 --> 02:42:22.634]  Executive Order 10995 allows seizure of all communications, media, and the United States.
[02:42:22.754 --> 02:42:26.298]  The FEMA control boxes were put in all radio and TV stations in 1997.
[02:42:26.638 --> 02:42:33.465]  Executive Order 10997 allows seizure of all electronic power, fuels, and materials, public and private.
[02:42:33.746 --> 02:42:34.967]  And see, they've been seasoned.
[02:42:35.047 --> 02:42:36.549]  Cops bring in food, they seize it.
[02:42:37.669 --> 02:42:41.072]  Other emergency groups, even the Red Cross does a little bit of good and brings in some food.
[02:42:41.432 --> 02:42:42.032]  It's seized.
[02:42:42.392 --> 02:42:44.294]  We have sponsors who drive it with big trucks.
[02:42:44.314 --> 02:42:45.334]  They go, what are you doing?
[02:42:45.834 --> 02:42:47.696]  Take them out of the car and steal their goods.
[02:42:48.236 --> 02:42:49.216]  And it doesn't go to the people.
[02:42:50.077 --> 02:42:57.622]  Executive Order 10997 allows the seizure of all electric power fuels, minerals, in public and private.
[02:42:59.483 --> 02:43:04.726]  Executive Order 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.
[02:43:05.498 --> 02:43:06.699]  Which will cause total breakdown.
[02:43:07.359 --> 02:43:16.524]  Executive Order 10999 allows the seizure of all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks, and vehicles of any kind, and total control of highways, seaports, and waterways.
[02:43:16.824 --> 02:43:19.645]  And the Supreme Court ruled, not even for an emergency.
[02:43:19.965 --> 02:43:22.247]  If some private interest wants your property, they get it.
[02:43:22.927 --> 02:43:24.488]  So see, it's just pure fascism.
[02:43:24.968 --> 02:43:34.533]  Executive Order 11000 allows seizure of all American people or workforces under federal supervision, including the splitting of families if the government finds it necessary.
[02:43:35.436 --> 02:43:37.578]  Again, they're beta testing all this in New Orleans.
[02:43:37.598 --> 02:43:40.201]  It turns out there was no reason to split up those families.
[02:43:40.241 --> 02:43:40.841]  They just did it.
[02:43:41.502 --> 02:43:47.788]  Executive Order 11001 allows seizure of all health, education, and welfare facilities, public and private.
[02:43:48.208 --> 02:43:54.274]  Executive Order 11002 empowered the Postmaster General to register all men, women, and children in the U.S.
[02:43:54.875 --> 02:43:58.276]  Executive Order 11003 allows seizure of all airports and aircraft.
[02:43:58.576 --> 02:44:07.019]  Executive Order 11004 allows seizure of all housing and finance authorities to establish forced relocation designated areas to be abandoned for as unsafe.
[02:44:07.399 --> 02:44:11.441]  Executive Order 1105 allows seizure of all railroads, island waterways,
[02:44:11.761 --> 02:44:12.441]  We're good to go.
[02:44:12.481 --> 02:44:13.122]  We're good to go.
[02:44:25.805 --> 02:44:37.387]  Executive Order 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit, and the flow of money in the U.S.
[02:44:37.407 --> 02:44:40.428]  financial institutions in any undefined national emergency.
[02:44:40.928 --> 02:44:46.529]  It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared, that the President, Congress, cannot review it for an action for six months.
[02:44:47.069 --> 02:44:53.130]  Executive Order 12919, signed June 3, 1994 by President Clinton, encompasses all the above executive orders.
[02:44:54.454 --> 02:44:56.615]  There's a lot of other ones that are even as bad or worse.
[02:44:57.836 --> 02:45:04.238]  But understand that you think the rich, powerful elites got there because they're sweet and they love you?
[02:45:05.559 --> 02:45:07.060]  No, because they're a bunch of ruthless scum.
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:08.680]  They're not free market.
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:09.361]  They're predatory.
[02:45:09.761 --> 02:45:19.425]  You can become wealthy and not be a criminal, but to become a multi-multi-billionaire, you've got to cut corners, you've got to make payoffs, and to go even higher, you've got to be really ruthless.
[02:45:20.683 --> 02:45:30.706]  And the globalists openly say, you shouldn't have an ice house, you shouldn't have a swimming pool, you shouldn't have an ice car, you shouldn't be able to run your life, your family should be broken up, they should have a government that controls your life.
[02:45:32.767 --> 02:45:45.591]  And so you give them these types of executive orders, these types of powers, they're going to accentuate crises, they're going to create crises, they're going to carry out terror attacks, because they want it all, folks.
[02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:50.733]  You give government unlimited power, it's going to abuse the living daylights out of you.
[02:45:50.873 --> 02:45:51.834]  Now that's human history.
[02:45:51.934 --> 02:45:54.156]  I don't need to listen to the founding fathers to know that.
[02:45:54.976 --> 02:45:56.318]  Even though they eloquently warned us.
[02:45:57.098 --> 02:46:02.042]  And your future, your children, your progeny, your name, everything this country is, is on the line.
[02:46:03.203 --> 02:46:10.630]  Don't it seem like they flipped the light switch with the economy and terror attacks and disasters and everything gets more power, everything gets more control?
[02:46:11.374 --> 02:46:24.649]  They talk about how great martial law is, how it keeps you safe every night on the news, and then magically stuff happens, and then you look at the feds not fixing the levees, and reports are explosions were going off at the levees, and those are now being confirmed.
[02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:32.638]  And we've got FEMA cutting communications lines and stopping cops from saving their own families and just sitting on their big hind ends laughing.
[02:46:33.607 --> 02:46:35.369]  Telling women to give them sexual favors.
[02:46:36.450 --> 02:46:37.531]  FEMA full of criminals.
[02:46:37.571 --> 02:46:38.552]  That's mainstream news.
[02:46:38.612 --> 02:46:42.055]  Hardcore criminals that FEMA has hired to run their ranks.
[02:46:43.470 --> 02:46:50.313]  The article written by Steve Watson continues, So you see, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation.
[02:46:50.913 --> 02:46:59.776]  Should it so wish, it could completely wipe out the Constitution, yet this would be completely unlawful as it was not created under the Constitution or law by the Congress.
[02:47:00.317 --> 02:47:06.379]  FEMA is exactly the kind of parasitic bacterium the Founding Fathers warned Americans to stay vigilant against.
[02:47:06.969 --> 02:47:17.972]  The images interspersing the article provide us with the visual indications that a takeover has occurred in New Orleans and that all of the above executive orders are operative.
[02:47:18.713 --> 02:47:23.654]  We have also documented how FEMA has set up internment camps all over the U.S.
[02:47:23.974 --> 02:47:27.575]  to hold citizens deemed to be enemy combatants in times of crisis.
[02:47:28.155 --> 02:47:30.176]  All misdemeanors are considered terrorism.
[02:47:30.911 --> 02:47:37.617]  FEMA, which is endlessly drilled for such situations, has been complicit in hindering outside efforts to help in the wake of the disaster.
[02:47:38.077 --> 02:47:52.729]  After the authorities in Baton Rouge had prepared to field hospitals for victims of the storm, FEMA sent its first batch of supplies, all of which were designed and designated for use against chemical attack, including drugs such as Cipro, which is designed for use against anthrax.
[02:47:53.348 --> 02:47:57.372]  The London Guardian reported, we called them up and asked them, why did you send that?
[02:47:57.432 --> 02:48:01.576]  And they said, that's what it says in the book, says a Baton Rouge official.
[02:48:02.256 --> 02:48:09.303]  According to Jefferson Parish President Aaron Bouchard, federal bureaucrats have murdered the flood victims in New Orleans.
[02:48:09.363 --> 02:48:13.287]  Bouchard stated on Meet the Press, we have been abandoned by our own country.
[02:48:13.307 --> 02:48:16.530]  He went on to say, the CIA may be planning to kill me.
[02:48:17.228 --> 02:48:21.532]  Notice that the mayor, notice that Chavez in Venezuela, they all get out ahead of it.
[02:48:21.812 --> 02:48:22.493]  They're going to kill me.
[02:48:22.513 --> 02:48:23.174]  They're going to kill me.
[02:48:23.414 --> 02:48:25.916]  We have mayors talking about the CIA killing them now?
[02:48:26.297 --> 02:48:27.338]  Because they know, folks.
[02:48:28.118 --> 02:48:32.022]  He broke down in tears as he described how FEMA has cut emergency communications.
[02:48:32.803 --> 02:48:37.367]  Local officials no longer have any authority and have been forcibly evacuated.
[02:48:37.868 --> 02:48:38.608]  That's been reported.
[02:48:39.189 --> 02:48:40.730]  We'll be right back with some final calls.
[02:48:40.750 --> 02:48:41.191]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.121 --> 02:48:50.465]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.665 --> 02:48:55.109]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.249 --> 02:48:59.612]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.653 --> 02:49:01.014]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.788 --> 02:49:06.991]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.071 --> 02:49:13.996]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.117 --> 02:49:16.198]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.358 --> 02:49:26.866]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.147 --> 02:49:31.430]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3,
[02:49:31.630 --> 02:49:33.772]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.936 --> 02:49:46.577]  We're good to go.
[02:50:06.874 --> 02:50:13.718]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:50:13.778 --> 02:50:16.100]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:34.051 --> 02:50:38.093]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:40.714 --> 02:50:43.496]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:43.696 --> 02:50:52.940]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.161 --> 02:50:55.422]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.602 --> 02:51:01.965]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,

[02:51:22.543 --> 02:51:23.023]  We're good to go.
[02:51:23.043 --> 02:51:23.784]  We're good to go.
[02:51:50.069 --> 02:51:51.590]  Let's take three final calls here.
[02:51:52.411 --> 02:51:54.072]  Russell and Josh and Art.
[02:51:55.593 --> 02:52:08.003]  I'm not going to belabor this, but very briefly, if you want any of the 12 films I produce, or any of the other great documentaries or books that I carry by other wonderful researchers and authors, be sure and visit InfoWars.com and the online bookstore.
[02:52:09.304 --> 02:52:11.325]  Be sure and take advantage of some of the discounts we've got.
[02:52:11.746 --> 02:52:14.328]  Some of my films as low as $5.95 apiece, folks.
[02:52:15.128 --> 02:52:15.989]  Huge discounts.
[02:52:16.690 --> 02:52:19.672]  Get Martial Law, get Road to Tyranny, get Matrix of Evil.
[02:52:20.607 --> 02:52:35.211]  And also, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv for 15 cents a day, see all the films, lately TV reports, all of it in high quality, low bandwidth and high bandwidth streams in many different formats at PrisonPlanet.tv or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:52:35.231 --> 02:52:36.611]  You want the number for the big Berkeys?
[02:52:36.631 --> 02:52:36.792]  It's 888-803-4438.
[02:52:46.067 --> 02:52:51.551]  The number for Minus Resources in that gold deal, 800-686-2237.
[02:52:52.612 --> 02:52:56.194]  We've gotten some calls asking for those numbers, so there they are again.
[02:52:57.215 --> 02:52:59.236]  Let's go to Russell in Florida.
[02:52:59.477 --> 02:53:00.157]  Russell, welcome.
[02:53:00.637 --> 02:53:02.299]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:53:02.619 --> 02:53:04.480]  Great show today, right on the money as usual.
[02:53:06.902 --> 02:53:12.946]  I've been watching the spin channels, Fox and MSNBC and CNN,
[02:53:14.873 --> 02:53:16.575]  Yeah, I mean, in their little cloistered...
[02:53:35.952 --> 02:53:36.593]  I think?
[02:53:55.911 --> 02:54:01.593]  I just wondered if you thought of that, and if they're going to go back into their little shill mentality.
[02:54:01.613 --> 02:54:05.714]  Well, Shep didn't do much, but that Anderson Cooper did genuinely blow up.
[02:54:05.894 --> 02:54:16.778]  Yeah, he really was out there with a lot of the rescuers, getting his hands dirty right in the middle of it all, and he was noticeably outraged a few times.
[02:54:16.878 --> 02:54:20.439]  Well, Sean Penn was out there, and this is on record, he had witnesses,
[02:54:21.053 --> 02:54:22.594]  And he'd say, help me, help me get these women.
[02:54:22.634 --> 02:54:30.336]  And they'd just go, ha-ha, and take pictures of him like it was a big joke for their photo album and then tell the women right in front of him, hey, baby, give me some.
[02:54:30.376 --> 02:54:34.757]  You know, I mean, it just... And he said all day he saw two police boats out there.
[02:54:35.098 --> 02:54:39.619]  And they were helping people, but FEMA and others were just driving around trying to find some women.
[02:54:39.939 --> 02:54:40.599]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:40.639 --> 02:54:40.939]  Thank you.
[02:54:41.179 --> 02:54:42.040]  Russell, great point.
[02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:42.980]  Sorry, we're almost out of time.
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:44.280]  Josh in New York.
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:45.021]  Go ahead, Josh.
[02:54:46.661 --> 02:54:47.221]  Hi, are you there?
[02:54:47.462 --> 02:54:47.682]  Yes.
[02:54:48.102 --> 02:54:48.682]  I just want to say...
[02:54:49.582 --> 02:54:57.365]  The definition of God comes from Gott in Old German, which means to offer a blood sacrifice to, as far as what I've read.
[02:54:57.385 --> 02:55:04.347]  Well, that's what I... And actually, the translation, too, out of it, it means the same thing in Aramaic and in others.
[02:55:04.467 --> 02:55:04.647]  It's a...
[02:55:05.214 --> 02:55:11.459]  And then I also just want to say... But regardless, folks, I mean, it's the modern use of the word God just means the deity, so I don't think it's... Go ahead.
[02:55:11.679 --> 02:55:19.565]  I'd always considered myself like a left-wing liberal before, but I've always believed in gun rights and stuff, and I totally agree with what you say about the left-right paradigm being terrible.
[02:55:19.585 --> 02:55:29.513]  Plus, I have a lot of, like, hippie friends and artist friends, and I've always warned them that if they should ever hit the fan, that they wouldn't... Well, should it ever hit the fan, thank you for your call, sir.
[02:55:30.394 --> 02:55:32.395]  Let's talk to Art.
[02:55:32.836 --> 02:55:34.337]  Art, you're on the air from Illinois.
[02:55:35.268 --> 02:55:35.708]  Hi.
[02:55:35.888 --> 02:55:36.449]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:36.509 --> 02:55:37.169]  This is Art.
[02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:39.790]  Actually, I'm from the suburbs of Chicago.
[02:55:39.890 --> 02:55:40.230]  Okay.
[02:55:40.250 --> 02:55:40.510]  Welcome.
[02:55:40.530 --> 02:55:41.591]  You've got about 30 seconds.
[02:55:41.971 --> 02:55:42.271]  Okay.
[02:55:42.992 --> 02:55:47.594]  Real quick, I just wanted to say I've been listening to you for maybe about three years now.
[02:55:48.294 --> 02:55:56.898]  And, you know, it's just amazing how far I've come in listening to you and going over a lot of information that you guys have been giving me.
[02:55:57.578 --> 02:56:03.881]  And I pretty much just want to say thank you for all you guys, what you do to wake people up out there.
[02:56:04.941 --> 02:56:06.102]  Well, I want to thank you.
[02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:07.982]  I want to thank you for being involved and caring.
[02:56:08.022 --> 02:56:11.024]  I mean, you make my family freer by caring and being involved.
[02:56:11.064 --> 02:56:12.004]  Please don't thank me.
[02:56:12.964 --> 02:56:15.285]  We're just doing our duty here, and I want to thank you, sir.
[02:56:16.085 --> 02:56:16.506]  Well, thanks.
[02:56:16.686 --> 02:56:18.166]  I mean, you know, I'm trying.
[02:56:18.486 --> 02:56:18.866]  Well, good.
[02:56:18.886 --> 02:56:19.747]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:20.007 --> 02:56:21.307]  Call me back tomorrow when I've got more time.
[02:56:21.347 --> 02:56:22.168]  I feel really bad.
[02:56:23.788 --> 02:56:24.429]  God bless you all.
[02:56:24.469 --> 02:56:25.349]  Take care.
