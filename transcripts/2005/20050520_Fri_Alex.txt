[00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:06.347]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.068]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:09.888]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:11.349]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.990]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:21.934]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:38.670]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, and no, I'm not joining you from my Central Texas Command Center.
[00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.773]  I'm up here at the mothership, the GCN Radio Network, right outside Minneapolis-St.
[00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.435]  Paul in the beautiful town of Burnsville.
[00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:51.488]  And we're going to be live here today for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:53.710]  And we're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.973]  In fact, I'm going to go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:00:57.593 --> 00:01:00.876]  And I am going to go in rapid fire to your calls.
[00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.718]  So have your questions, your comments.
[00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:04.939]  Your points ready.
[00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.580]  Toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.780]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.003]  I do this a few times a month.
[00:01:12.023 --> 00:01:16.485]  It's kind of like Washington Journal.
[00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:24.489]  Any issue you want to talk about, any news report you want to analyze, any piece of propaganda you want to discuss, look at this right here in front of me.
[00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.571]  This is the front page of the Star Tribune, the newspaper of the Twin Cities.
[00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:30.768]  And I'm looking at their Metro edition.
[00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:32.950]  Should women be shielded from combat?
[00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.353]  And it's got a picture of a black female U.S.
[00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:47.121]  Army, looks like a private, with her 9mm Beretta in her hand, marching about in a crowd of men.
[00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:50.684]  And many societies have tried to put women in combat.
[00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:53.706]  It does not work, and we end up with stuff like Private Lynch saying,
[00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.731]  We're good to go.
[00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:36.546]  Well, over in England, Nanny Prescott wants to control the temperature of your bath, this other one in Telegraph, with little sensor controllers on all of the hot water heaters in the British Isles.
[00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:50.391]  And of course, we also have the federal initiative going through the state at the California level, the state level, where they want to have federal computer controls on all air conditioners where they can decide when and how you can use your air conditioner.
[00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:54.292]  All micromanagement at every level of society.
[00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:54.952]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:59.774]  Also, I haven't really read any of the subsections of Patriot Act II in over a year.
[00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:03.555]  Back in early January of 2003, days after the text was
[00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:11.237]  ...of the introduced bill was released to the public, while Ashcroft was still denying that it even existed.
[00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:16.719]  Oh yes, my friends, we got the legislation, and I wrote a detailed analysis of it.
[00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.421]  A lot of people had trouble believing what was in the analysis, but they checked it out for themselves, and I won second place in the Project Censored Awards, which I was honored to win.
[00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.842]  But the point is, their people went and checked out my facts and found them to be accurate.
[00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:31.484]  Since then, people found even worse stuff in Patriot Act 2.
[00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.664]  The analysis by the lawyers...
[00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:33.965]  We're good to go.
[00:03:51.892 --> 00:04:00.358]  And here's one out of the Kentucky Courier-Journal by James Malone, pastor who bought books online, got FBI file.
[00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:03.820]  He was actually researching Islam, exposing Islam.
[00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:10.405]  He bought a Koran so that he could get the particular passages out that he thought were so egregious.
[00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:11.526]  We're good to go.
[00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:35.557]  And I'm sure you've heard about the billboards saying LA's Mexico.
[00:04:35.597 --> 00:04:42.302]  Well, the new thing is in Medford, Oregon, where they fly the Mexican flag at the government offices above the American flag.
[00:04:43.503 --> 00:04:46.385]  And generals offer a sober outlook on the Iraq war.
[00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:47.886]  That's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:54.571]  Your calls are coming up at 800-259-9231, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com are the websites.
[00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:56.632]  I saw Star Wars last night.
[00:04:56.652 --> 00:04:58.854]  I have a horrible review of it coming up as well.
[00:04:58.874 --> 00:04:59.294]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.165]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:09.866]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.267]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:14.509]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.712]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.052 --> 00:05:24.075]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:26.116]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:36.839]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.879]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:42.941]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:44.621]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:45.401]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:51.523 --> 00:05:52.785]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:06.474]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.814 --> 00:06:10.916]  You asked us to make a water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.216 --> 00:06:11.756]  We listened.
[00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:17.058]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:17.798]  We listened.
[00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:21.220]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.180]  We listened.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.682]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:27.942]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.982]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:13.646]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.567]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, M.D.,
[00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:21.430]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.914]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[00:07:28.174 --> 00:07:32.416]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:34.297]  Here's Cheryl Gee in California.
[00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:40.981]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do without an exercise in two to three years.
[00:07:41.281 --> 00:07:47.845]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid quail is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at quaildirect.com.
[00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:51.587]  Quail your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:54.908]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:58.230]  Quail is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.671]  Individual results may vary.
[00:08:01.012 --> 00:08:06.074]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:08.716]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:25.812]  Well, my friends, it is May 20th, 2005 on this live Friday edition.
[00:08:25.832 --> 00:08:27.132]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:30.333]  I've got a lot of really serious news and information.
[00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:32.433]  Of course, we already have loaded phone lines.
[00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:38.655]  We're going to Daryl, Ken, Russell, Tony, Jason, and many others here in just a few minutes that heard me give out the toll-free number there on the 1st.
[00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:42.512]  A little segment of the broadcast.
[00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:53.878]  But last night, I flew into Minnesota because I've only been up to the network two or three times in the past, and I've been on the GCN Radio Network for over, what, six years now.
[00:08:54.418 --> 00:08:58.140]  And so I figured I better go up and, you know, visit them every couple years.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:05.924]  And so I jumped on an airplane yesterday afternoon and got here about 9 o'clock, and Ted Anderson picked me up at the airport, and I said, let's go see Star Wars.
[00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:12.740]  So we pulled into a theater, and contrary to popular belief, the theater was about a third of the way filled.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.741]  And so Ted Anderson and one of his nephews was also along.
[00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:21.462]  And we all sat there and watched it.
[00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:31.484]  And our analysis of it, our review of it, was basically... We were all in unison that it was pretty cheesy.
[00:09:32.644 --> 00:09:34.525]  The special effects were pretty good, but...
[00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:36.029]  We're good to go.
[00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:54.233]  The media society that we've become, where media is king, media is god.
[00:09:54.853 --> 00:09:57.995]  It is the biggest group of movies in world history.
[00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:00.737]  And it's affected so many different areas of our society.
[00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:07.221]  And, of course, there have been hundreds of mainstream news articles the last few months drawing parallels.
[00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:18.937]  Between how the Emperor uses crises, terror attacks, basically, that he creates as a pretext to set up a police state and sweep aside the last remnants of the Republic.
[00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:23.120]  So the plots of Episode 1, 2, and 3, I would call them excellent.
[00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:30.045]  But the actors and... I mean, folks, I've seen after-school specials that have better acting than this.
[00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:36.389]  And then, of course, the worst thing was Hayden Christensen, who is not a heroic...
[00:10:38.184 --> 00:10:39.385]  We're good to go.
[00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:05.255]  Well, that's almost what Darth Vader looks like in this movie.
[00:11:05.335 --> 00:11:06.696]  It is ridiculous.
[00:11:07.377 --> 00:11:19.627]  Of course, in the first film, Episode 4, that came out in 1977, they used William Prowess, a 6'7 champion bodybuilder who had a lot of physical presence.
[00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:36.539]  No, this time the nerds over at Skywalker Ranch put a bunch of blithering twits and geeks, and it just is disgusting to see such a good plot line being ruined by this.
[00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:38.981]  And also, you'd watch one part of the film...
[00:11:39.682 --> 00:11:40.062]  We're good to go.
[00:12:02.552 --> 00:12:08.761]  Given the Battlestar Galactica miniseries by a friend, he said it was real good, and I watched it and I thought it was excellent.
[00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:10.724]  Great acting, great special effects.
[00:12:11.204 --> 00:12:15.230]  I would give it four stars out of five, and I would give Star Wars two and a half.
[00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.712]  I mean, I've just got to say it, folks.
[00:12:18.273 --> 00:12:20.334]  It was really disappointing.
[00:12:20.654 --> 00:12:26.818]  All right, now, that aside, I've now spent about three or four minutes on something that on the surface is completely mindless.
[00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:35.844]  You know we don't talk about pop culture here, other than the fact that Star Wars does expose government-sponsored terror, and Lucas has admitted it's based on secret societies.
[00:12:36.404 --> 00:12:41.728]  There's also kind of an angle here in the film with child sacrifice.
[00:12:42.148 --> 00:12:49.933]  So there's a lot of different elements that tie into the Thule and Thule Society and the people that funded Hitler and those that set up Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:51.334]  You know it as the Illuminati.
[00:12:51.374 --> 00:12:53.835]  They call themselves the Order of Death.
[00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:55.456]  Hey, that's nice, John!
[00:12:56.577 --> 00:12:59.318]  John figured out how to pump me audio into my headset.
[00:13:00.859 --> 00:13:02.520]  Or did that just magically happen?
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.801]  This is amazing.
[00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:08.664]  I mean, all the years I've been doing talk radio, nine years talk radio, coming up on 11 years on TV...
[00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:15.997]  When I do talk radio, I always get the audio of my voice back in my head and back in my ears.
[00:13:17.356 --> 00:13:26.603]  And they have it set up where you hear the callers and the music and the computer when it's playing ads, but you don't hear your own voice.
[00:13:26.643 --> 00:13:30.806]  And I was like a two-year-old that had lost their teddy bear at nighttime or something.
[00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:36.811]  I was very distraught and having trouble with my poise and beginning to start bumbling here.
[00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:45.878]  But all of a sudden, magically, I'm looking at John through the glass, sitting there doing a great job, but not moving his hands, and suddenly I've got audio.
[00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:51.842]  So God has blessed us, because John, you were telling me this studio is not set up to send us our own audio, correct?
[00:13:53.143 --> 00:13:56.826]  That is correct, but just magically I now am getting my own audio.
[00:13:56.946 --> 00:13:58.507]  This is very nice, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:59.608 --> 00:14:04.472]  Alright, I mentioned during that first little segment, I'm going to go to your calls almost immediately.
[00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:05.533]  I'm going to do that here in just a minute.
[00:14:06.353 --> 00:14:10.957]  Then I want to spend a lot of time today, because I tend to get desensitized.
[00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:25.833]  You know, back when we first got Army War College documents in 1998 and January of 2000 saying they're going to put microchips on all of us, it's going to be the law, they're going to use the fad-driven society, the Hollywood-driven society, the VIP society to sell us this.
[00:14:25.853 --> 00:14:27.894]  They actually say that in some of the documents.
[00:14:27.914 --> 00:14:34.778]  You know, I would get really upset and pull my hair out, almost literally, yell and scream on the air, you know, perseverating on the subject.
[00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:40.490]  But then now our Mexican Attorney General wants to put microchips in his employees if they want to go to work.
[00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:42.392]  Yeah, the military wants to do it.
[00:14:42.793 --> 00:14:44.995]  All these police chiefs are getting in here in the U.S.
[00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:47.997]  Sean Hannity says all the children need microchips.
[00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:56.045]  I tend to get desensitized and conditioned just because we've heard about microchips being implanted in us so many times from the mainstream media that I quit covering it.
[00:14:56.385 --> 00:14:57.326]  It becomes old hat.
[00:14:58.374 --> 00:15:00.355]  The same things happened with the Patriot Act II.
[00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:02.456]  I have fallen down the jump.
[00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:07.499]  You know, I first wrote an analysis of Patriot Act I days after it was passed, October 27, 2001.
[00:15:08.439 --> 00:15:26.108]  And then days after they enrolled Patriot Act II, on January 6, 2003, I wrote the first detailed analysis, about 12 pages long, of the bill, subsection by subsection, with links to the actual subsections of the bill itself, so you can check out my analysis.
[00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:31.971]  And I talked about it for a year or so, and put a lot of it in my video, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:34.873]  But I hadn't really gotten into it much the last few years.
[00:15:34.953 --> 00:15:40.037]  I mean, we've talked about it some as 400 plus cities, and now I guess I'm told six states.
[00:15:40.077 --> 00:15:40.937]  It's not five anymore.
[00:15:41.298 --> 00:15:42.419]  Six states have thrown it out.
[00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:51.365]  But now they're trying to expand what they haven't been able to pass in Patriot Act 2, because they've already passed some of the subsections in the Intelligent Enhancement Act and a few others.
[00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:52.867]  But...
[00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:54.426]  We're good to go.
[00:16:11.688 --> 00:16:16.309]  And so I think it's important that we go back over what is in Patriot Act 2.
[00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:24.672]  Finally, the mainstream media, the Associated Press and a few big newspapers are actually covering that they won't even need rubber stamp warrants.
[00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:30.893]  Whereas now under Patriot Act 1, a judge just signs a big blanket warrant and then they go out and search whoever they want.
[00:16:30.953 --> 00:16:32.194]  Now there won't even be warrants.
[00:16:32.454 --> 00:16:34.474]  There won't even be subpoenas.
[00:16:34.534 --> 00:16:35.715]  There can be secret arrests.
[00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:38.195]  National DNA databases for everybody.
[00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:40.016]  Literally dozens of
[00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:49.284]  Dozens and dozens of very egregious, totally un-American, Nazi-slash-Sovietized-type provisions.
[00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:57.812]  So I wanted to go over that later in this hour after we take these calls, and then I wanted to mesh it with the latest report of what the Patriot Act and Homeland Security is doing to average people.
[00:16:57.832 --> 00:17:00.555]  A pastor who bought books online got an FBI file.
[00:17:00.835 --> 00:17:06.140]  He bought a couple of Korans and some other things for their religion study group that he was exposing in church.
[00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:07.222]  Thank you.
[00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:21.079]  Regardless, let's say he was a Muslim buying Korans.
[00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:26.123]  How was he going to get on a list now and not be able to fly, not be able to go into Canada?
[00:17:26.703 --> 00:17:35.490]  And so Raymond Payne first learned that the FBI might be interested in him when he tried to cross the border into Canada last fall for some sightseeing, and the rest is history.
[00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:40.553]  Another article, Cashless Society, wave and pay with wireless credit cards.
[00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:43.856]  They're going to make you basically switch over to this in the next few years.
[00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:46.558]  Another one here, FBI calls animal rights activists...
[00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.583]  Worst terror threat, really?
[00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:51.231]  Yeah, and the Border Patrol's in order to stand down.
[00:17:52.117 --> 00:17:54.198]  So that's coming up, too.
[00:17:54.218 --> 00:17:59.800]  I'm going to go over some of the subsections from my analysis, Secret Patriot Act II destroys remaining U.S.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.120]  liberty.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.342]  Total police state takeover of the Secret Patriot Act II destroys what is left of American liberty that I wrote on 2-11-03.
[00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:09.924]  Right now, let's go to Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[00:18:09.944 --> 00:18:11.404]  Then we'll go to break and come back and talk to others.
[00:18:11.644 --> 00:18:12.325]  Daryl, welcome.
[00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:13.425]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:14.085]  Good, my friend.
[00:18:14.325 --> 00:18:16.786]  And I just want to make a couple of very quick items.
[00:18:16.806 --> 00:18:21.348]  Since you're up there in Burnsville, I want to say that the board operators at Genesis are fantastic folks.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.480]  We're good to go.
[00:18:48.911 --> 00:18:53.532]  And I'd urge folks to go up, print off copies, and hand them out to their... Well, I appreciate that, Darrell.
[00:18:53.572 --> 00:18:58.914]  Almost everything that I bring up on the broadcast, I have the bills, the documents, the news articles in front of me.
[00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:00.414]  I mean, right now, they're here in front of me.
[00:19:00.534 --> 00:19:10.397]  And you've got a great search engine on there, also, where they can just type in some names, torture, Guantanamo Bay, etc., and get a ton of great articles to print off for their friends.
[00:19:10.437 --> 00:19:12.157]  Yeah, this stuff is all hidden in plain view.
[00:19:12.617 --> 00:19:18.279]  And the final thing, Alex, I just want to say, God bless and protect you, and Violet, Paul Joseph Watson, and anybody...
[00:19:18.772 --> 00:19:23.234]  That contributes to helping keep your website up, putting out the great videos, etc.
[00:19:23.254 --> 00:19:25.235]  You and Violet do a tremendous job.
[00:19:25.256 --> 00:19:26.136]  Well, thank you, Darrell.
[00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:28.337]  Have you seen the new film, Martial Law?
[00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:29.118]  Yes, I have.
[00:19:29.178 --> 00:19:30.478]  I have it, and it's great.
[00:19:30.658 --> 00:19:33.460]  But all of your videos are, I mean, Masters of Terror...
[00:19:34.211 --> 00:19:38.654]  The 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny, all three police state videos are great.
[00:19:38.694 --> 00:19:40.075]  Well, give me your real take on it.
[00:19:40.115 --> 00:19:41.776]  I mean, I think Martial Law is my best film.
[00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:42.316]  What do you say?
[00:19:42.796 --> 00:19:47.039]  I say it ranks right up there with Masters of Terror.
[00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.760]  I love that one because I love history.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.541]  Well, that has the most information.
[00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:52.642]  They're all great, Alex, and God bless you.
[00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:53.382]  Thanks for all you do.
[00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:54.183]  Well, thank you, Darrell.
[00:19:54.303 --> 00:19:57.805]  All right, Ken, Russell, Tony, Jason, others, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:19:57.825 --> 00:19:59.126]  Don't forget at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.833]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:20:07.993 --> 00:20:09.053]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:20:09.173 --> 00:20:10.054]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:20:10.174 --> 00:20:13.015]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:18.058]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.398]  Check out this new product.
[00:20:19.558 --> 00:20:22.460]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.542]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:20:26.682 --> 00:20:26.862]  Look.
[00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:27.682]  We're good to go.
[00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:44.608]  Come on.
[00:20:44.668 --> 00:20:46.551]  It's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No B.O.
[00:20:46.571 --> 00:20:47.152]  That's No-B.O.com.
[00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:02.735]  Hello, folks.

[00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:08.140]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.820]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.561]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:18.042]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:22:18.342 --> 00:22:19.562]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:22:19.622 --> 00:22:22.323]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[00:22:56.727 --> 00:22:59.831]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:23:01.727 --> 00:23:05.129]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:08.932]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:15.176]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is Saint Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:22.481]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[00:23:22.641 --> 00:23:26.484]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[00:23:26.864 --> 00:23:27.405]  We're good to go.
[00:23:27.425 --> 00:23:27.645]  I think?
[00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:49.500]  The information war continues.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:17.308]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.728 --> 00:24:19.949]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:20.769 --> 00:24:21.929]  Let's go right back to your calls.
[00:24:22.229 --> 00:24:22.649]  Russell?
[00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.390]  Actually, Ken's up next.
[00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.630]  Ken in New York.
[00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.351]  Go ahead, Ken.
[00:24:26.711 --> 00:24:27.391]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:38.755]  So, with the election of Antonio Villaraigosa as Los Angeles mayor, it's now official and complete, the Reconquista in Los Angeles.
[00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.736]  And while that's going on in...
[00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:46.457]  Los Angeles and the rest of the Southwest where you are in Texas.
[00:24:47.158 --> 00:24:51.742]  There's also just the plain old conquista going on in other parts of the country.
[00:24:51.822 --> 00:24:53.323]  You just mentioned Medford, Oregon.
[00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:54.524]  That's kind of interesting.
[00:24:55.498 --> 00:24:57.739]  But I'd just like to relay a few things.
[00:24:57.759 --> 00:25:08.462]  Well, for those that don't know, because I said that in the first little segment, placing the Mexican flag above Old Glory, Mexican flag flies in Oregon Employment Office above the American flag.
[00:25:08.502 --> 00:25:14.804]  See, it's not enough to not fly the American flag in five South Texas towns and not allow English in court proceedings.
[00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.665]  Now, Oregon is part of the Aztec Kingdom.
[00:25:18.025 --> 00:25:19.405]  Right, and that's a government building.
[00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:20.666]  That's what's really in danger.
[00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:21.666]  And the government's behind it.
[00:25:21.706 --> 00:25:21.966]  Go ahead.
[00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:22.186]  Right.
[00:25:23.012 --> 00:25:29.217]  So a couple of weeks ago, I called the FCC and the FTC over an issue.
[00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:34.482]  And the first word I heard from the recorded message was, Gracias.
[00:25:35.563 --> 00:25:38.786]  I know a little Spanish, being here in New York, there's a large Puerto Rican population.
[00:25:38.806 --> 00:25:39.546]  That means thank you.
[00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:40.147]  Right.
[00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:47.433]  And what I got from the rest of the greeting was, if you want to continue in English, press 1.
[00:25:48.454 --> 00:25:49.695]  That's the first thing I heard.
[00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.654]  As if Spanish was the primary language in the country.
[00:25:54.756 --> 00:26:04.108]  And then I called up, I read about this in the newspaper, that if you call Chase Manhattan MasterCard Services, you will be greeted with a Spanish first greeting.
[00:26:04.588 --> 00:26:06.871]  And then if you want to continue in English, you press 1.
[00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:12.199]  Yeah, and Spanish is only 11% of the country.
[00:26:12.539 --> 00:26:13.700]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.681]  See, the government wants this.
[00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:17.362]  They want to break America down.
[00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:21.664]  We'll be a nice little third world slave state very soon if they have their way.
[00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:24.846]  And two final things on that point.
[00:26:25.587 --> 00:26:36.473]  Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut, who started his career, I think, in the Peace Corps, he gave a speech, according to the New American, to La Raza in Washington.
[00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:39.537]  And his address was in Spanish.
[00:26:39.557 --> 00:26:41.398]  He gave it only in Spanish.
[00:26:42.339 --> 00:27:00.815]  And then Senator Melvin Martinez from Florida, who was Bush's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, when Alberto Gonzalez was getting confirmed for his post, he gave his first speech on the Senate floor and he gave it in Spanish.
[00:27:01.645 --> 00:27:03.486]  No, I know, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[00:27:03.826 --> 00:27:05.546]  And the things you're bringing up were absolutely true.
[00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:06.667]  I mean, why are they doing this?
[00:27:07.107 --> 00:27:15.310]  Because they plan to bring in tens of millions every few years, more from Latin America, to balkanize the country.
[00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.630]  I mean, this is the plan.
[00:27:17.811 --> 00:27:19.271]  Let's go to Russell in Florida.
[00:27:19.331 --> 00:27:20.172]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:21.212]  Russell, go ahead.
[00:27:21.392 --> 00:27:21.912]  Hey, Alex.
[00:27:22.252 --> 00:27:23.693]  I haven't been able to call you in a few weeks.
[00:27:23.773 --> 00:27:24.493]  Pleasure to be on.
[00:27:25.114 --> 00:27:28.715]  I want to first echo what Daryl said earlier about your films and about...
[00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.511]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:27:47.102 --> 00:27:49.283]  Well, we've had a massive effect because of you, the listeners.
[00:27:49.323 --> 00:27:54.225]  I mean, just in my little fight against the New World Order, teaming up with the listeners, we've had a huge effect.
[00:27:54.705 --> 00:27:58.206]  I mean, I really cannot even find words to describe how large it's been.
[00:27:58.246 --> 00:28:06.549]  But thousands of videos can turn into millions of videos by listeners making copies and then telling others that you give copies to make copies.
[00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:06.889]  Yeah.
[00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:13.852]  Well, I'm actually also trying to have a large screening of it at one of the theaters here in Florida, in Melbourne.
[00:28:14.332 --> 00:28:16.093]  So hopefully that'll work and...
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.740]  It'll get the word out.
[00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:24.102]  I had a question regarding this new so-called scandal over these Saddam Hussein pictures.
[00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.043]  Yes, the underwear photos.
[00:28:26.323 --> 00:28:27.584]  Do you think it's just a psyop?
[00:28:28.384 --> 00:28:28.984]  Of course it is.
[00:28:29.004 --> 00:28:31.825]  They released it on purpose and blamed some British newspaper.
[00:28:32.718 --> 00:28:40.804]  And it's just like the government released to CBS News some of the lighter torture photos when the General's own report was hundreds of times worse.
[00:28:41.185 --> 00:28:44.747]  Raping, killing, beating to death, you name it.
[00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:48.130]  And imagine if they had our troops up there in their underwear.
[00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:50.147]  And then bring in the good cop, which is
[00:29:08.197 --> 00:29:11.661]  Well, their PR's been horrible, and all on purpose.
[00:29:11.681 --> 00:29:14.284]  So, you know, everything they've been doing is to enrage the Muslim world.
[00:29:14.344 --> 00:29:14.384]  So...
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.243]  I just figured it was a psy-op, and I just want to get your point on it.
[00:29:31.283 --> 00:29:33.345]  Clearly a psy-op, and there's a hundred reasons why.
[00:29:33.365 --> 00:29:35.487]  I mean, they don't release photos of Saddam for nothing.
[00:29:36.088 --> 00:29:37.609]  No, this is amazing.
[00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:38.290]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:41.453]  We'll get to Tony and Jason and others.
[00:29:41.473 --> 00:29:41.594]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:41.614 --> 00:29:41.674]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:41.694 --> 00:29:42.214]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:44.517]  A ton of news in your call straight ahead.
[00:29:51.838 --> 00:29:52.739]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.842]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.763 --> 00:29:58.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.218 --> 00:31:03.179]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:13.984]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.344 --> 00:31:18.886]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.946 --> 00:31:30.292]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.872 --> 00:31:37.719]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:40.261]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.742 --> 00:31:45.726]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.780]  gold and silver coins.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.981]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:32:34.141 --> 00:32:34.901]  Which are collectible?
[00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:35.681]  Which are bullion?

[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.721]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:12.821 --> 00:33:18.404]  Coming to you live from the GCN Radio Network Studios up in beautiful Minneapolis, St.
[00:33:18.484 --> 00:33:19.225]  Paul today.
[00:33:19.245 --> 00:33:26.209]  I'm just up here visiting for one day, and then I'm back to central Texas, deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:29.671]  We're taking a lot of your calls today, wide open phones.
[00:33:30.151 --> 00:33:31.532]  We're just getting warmed up here.
[00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:34.073]  I'm going to just accelerate through them in the news as well.
[00:33:34.093 --> 00:33:34.153]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:37.921 --> 00:33:38.522]  We're good to go.
[00:33:38.682 --> 00:33:39.623]  We're good to go.
[00:33:55.809 --> 00:34:05.812]  Say the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today to not take calls and to just spend about 20-30 minutes on the basic structure of the New World Order from my perspective and my studying.
[00:34:06.632 --> 00:34:11.153]  In fact, maybe on the computer screen there type a note for me and just keep it up there and I'll remember to do that.
[00:34:11.173 --> 00:34:14.654]  I'm really apt to get sidetracked and run down rabbit trails.
[00:34:15.794 --> 00:34:17.615]  Just two quick items and then we'll go right to your calls.
[00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.611]  My new film, Martial Law, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:28.935]  It covers the police state, the latest 9-11 information, and who the globalists are, their occult background, the secret society that controls them.
[00:34:29.395 --> 00:34:30.576]  You really need to get this film.
[00:34:30.596 --> 00:34:33.318]  Three hours on DVD, over two and a half on VHS.
[00:34:34.148 --> 00:34:40.429]  And it's my best work, $25.95, second copy $19.95, and it goes down like a few bucks each additional copy you get.
[00:34:40.689 --> 00:34:42.369]  Or buy one copy and make copies.
[00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.890]  Just please get it on AXS TV.
[00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.370]  Please show it at your local VFW Hall, at your local library.
[00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:49.531]  Show it to your college students, your high school students.
[00:34:49.871 --> 00:35:00.133]  I'm getting reports every week of colleges and high school teachers, conservatives, liberals, people that love freedom, that have gotten past those false terms, those labels, and that are standing up against the New World Order.
[00:35:00.153 --> 00:35:01.853]  I had somebody up here at Genesis today.
[00:35:02.413 --> 00:35:02.973]  We're good to go.
[00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:35.714]  And all we're trying to do is get the people more liberty and more freedom, and I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:35:36.114 --> 00:35:37.876]  I'm not a liberal or a conservative.
[00:35:38.337 --> 00:35:40.839]  And I love freedom, and I hope you love freedom too.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.081]  And I hope you'll get...
[00:35:42.967 --> 00:35:44.068]  Martial law, my friends.
[00:35:44.088 --> 00:35:48.291]  Toll-free number to order it, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:35:48.311 --> 00:35:58.177]  Or order hard copies of the films via Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:58.197 --> 00:36:02.340]  You can watch clips of the films, read about them, look at all the specials on the website or ask about the specials.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.522]  There's a lot of them, so ask about them when you call or when you go to the website.
[00:36:05.562 --> 00:36:06.563]  Be sure and look for the specials.
[00:36:07.344 --> 00:36:12.889]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv right now, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, $5.95 a month.
[00:36:13.389 --> 00:36:16.713]  A cup of coffee, folks, costs $1 at a gas station, $1.50 at Starbucks.
[00:36:16.753 --> 00:36:20.056]  I mean, this is 15 cents a day, my friends.
[00:36:20.556 --> 00:36:23.159]  And you get three months for free when you get a yearly subscription.
[00:36:23.179 --> 00:36:29.245]  And we've now been operating prisonplanet.tv for 14 months.
[00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:31.327]  And there are just, I don't know, probably...
[00:36:32.285 --> 00:36:34.306]  300, 400, probably more than that.
[00:36:34.867 --> 00:36:40.490]  Audio clips, interviews, my TV shows, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.871]  There's just hundreds of things on there.
[00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:45.293]  More material going up every day at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:46.053]  We're very proud of it.
[00:36:46.094 --> 00:36:46.974]  We thank you for your support.
[00:36:47.234 --> 00:36:52.397]  And then, of course, coming up Friday, June 3rd, we're coming up on that date.
[00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:59.982]  I'm going to show martial law in Austin, Texas at the Alamo Draft House Cinema in downtown on Colorado Street at 7 and 10 p.m.,
[00:37:00.282 --> 00:37:00.602]  We're good to go.
[00:37:24.944 --> 00:37:28.626]  You know, any of the big chains, and get your tickets right there, or you can get them at the door.
[00:37:29.026 --> 00:37:31.847]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Tony in Arkansas.
[00:37:31.887 --> 00:37:32.587]  Tony, go ahead.
[00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:34.908]  It's an honor always to speak with you, Alex.
[00:37:35.008 --> 00:37:36.749]  No, it's an honor to talk to you, please.
[00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:37.549]  Thank you, bro.
[00:37:38.229 --> 00:37:40.991]  Listen, just a couple of quick comments, run through them as quickly as I could.
[00:37:41.091 --> 00:37:51.555]  I'm in a small town in central Arkansas, about 30,000 people, but I go to a pretty large-sized Baptist church, and one of our members is an owner of a radio station that broadcasts to the region here,
[00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:57.134]  And I've got a write-in program that we're trying to do to the large conservative radio station, Little Rock.
[00:37:57.154 --> 00:37:58.075]  It's not Clear Channel.
[00:37:58.115 --> 00:38:00.418]  I know they're NWO at Sentinel or something like that.
[00:38:00.938 --> 00:38:03.241]  But we're trying to get your program on.
[00:38:04.389 --> 00:38:07.530]  The one local here, he just runs country.
[00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.631]  It's a small radio station, but he reaches potentially about 60,000 people.
[00:38:12.011 --> 00:38:17.253]  But he runs mostly country and western music from the 40s, 50s and 60s.
[00:38:17.273 --> 00:38:24.135]  I've got some people writing into the big radio station because they just put so much stupid things on on the weekend.
[00:38:24.155 --> 00:38:26.456]  They run like Sean Hannity and Rush and all that.
[00:38:26.756 --> 00:38:33.602]  But we thought if we could even just get an hour of your program on the weekends, who could we write to get a packet?
[00:38:33.622 --> 00:38:35.183]  I don't even know how to go about that.
[00:38:35.543 --> 00:38:36.524]  How would we go about that?
[00:38:36.864 --> 00:38:44.450]  And we know the person in our church that's at the smaller station, but I would love... I mean, they do Dr. Demento and stuff on the weekends and like mechanic stuff.
[00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.654]  And if we could just even get an hour, and I just don't even know who to contact, how we would...
[00:38:49.194 --> 00:38:55.803]  If I talk to this person at my church, which I'm going to, how would we get a packet from you to get to him?
[00:38:56.063 --> 00:38:58.586]  Let me try to go over that for you.
[00:38:58.626 --> 00:38:59.608]  I appreciate it.
[00:38:59.688 --> 00:39:02.351]  John, what's the extension for affiliate relations?
[00:39:02.371 --> 00:39:05.375]  Do you have a list of that?
[00:39:05.395 --> 00:39:05.655]  1-what? 183.
[00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:14.154]  Okay, when you call the station, number one, tell them to go to GCNlive.com.
[00:39:14.174 --> 00:39:16.016]  I mean, we've got everything they want.
[00:39:16.056 --> 00:39:18.718]  We've got conservative talk shows, patriotic talk shows.
[00:39:18.738 --> 00:39:23.081]  There's even some what you'd call more progressive liberal talk shows on the network.
[00:39:23.101 --> 00:39:24.222]  There's gardening shows.
[00:39:24.322 --> 00:39:26.884]  There's very popular auto mechanic shows.
[00:39:26.924 --> 00:39:32.708]  There's Derry Brownfield, who for decades has been doing a land rights program, very anti-New World Order.
[00:39:32.768 --> 00:39:33.329]  Yeah, he's awesome.
[00:39:33.549 --> 00:39:34.430]  A very good program.
[00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:35.691]  We're good to go.
[00:39:52.066 --> 00:39:53.828]  Tell them to go to GCNlive.com.
[00:39:53.848 --> 00:39:58.051]  There's a list for affiliates, for people who want to be affiliates, a phone number.
[00:39:58.331 --> 00:40:00.032]  There's the digital satellites we've got.
[00:40:00.072 --> 00:40:01.894]  We've got the professional satellite they need.
[00:40:02.114 --> 00:40:04.475]  We lease one from Clear Channel because they're the folks that own them.
[00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:06.757]  So we've got a Clear Channel feed.
[00:40:06.957 --> 00:40:10.440]  We've got part of the time an ABC feed because they've got the big digital birds.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:10.640]  Right.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.360]  Right, right.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.141]  And we've got analog feeds.
[00:40:13.441 --> 00:40:16.803]  We've got frequency extender digital phone line feeds.
[00:40:16.823 --> 00:40:17.503]  We'll provide them.
[00:40:17.883 --> 00:40:20.905]  We've got what they need if they want to pick up the broadcast.
[00:40:20.945 --> 00:40:25.947]  And almost every affiliate I've gotten is because, and I appreciate your call.
[00:40:25.967 --> 00:40:26.807]  Okay, I have one more.
[00:40:27.308 --> 00:40:30.429]  Okay, well let me just try to, I've got a lot of callers, but let me just try to answer this question quickly.
[00:40:31.172 --> 00:40:31.672]  We're good to go.
[00:40:31.712 --> 00:40:31.872]  I think?
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.301]  There's a bunch of them that have been calling lately.
[00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:52.621]  I've been so busy, I haven't been calling them back.
[00:40:52.641 --> 00:40:53.061]  That's bad.
[00:40:53.082 --> 00:40:54.442]  I haven't even called the network to give them their numbers.
[00:40:54.482 --> 00:40:55.243]  I'm just so busy.
[00:40:56.183 --> 00:41:02.846]  And they go, Alex, I thought you were totally full of it, but everything you said came true, and I'm putting you on our station in San Diego.
[00:41:02.866 --> 00:41:07.008]  Or, Alex, I'm putting you on our station in, you know, just all over the place.
[00:41:07.388 --> 00:41:09.689]  Because everything I've talked about has come true.
[00:41:09.729 --> 00:41:11.410]  They thought I was a kook five years ago.
[00:41:11.891 --> 00:41:13.891]  Now, unfortunately, they've seen it come true.
[00:41:14.132 --> 00:41:15.452]  So that's another way we get affiliates.
[00:41:15.512 --> 00:41:16.873]  Real quick, your last question.
[00:41:17.753 --> 00:41:25.857]  Being a member of Prison Planet TV, I encourage anybody to get that as quickly as they can because just look at the mock terror thing they did a couple weeks back in D.C.
[00:41:25.877 --> 00:41:26.878]  where they rushed everybody out.
[00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:37.963]  If that had been the real next one that they're going to pull, you may wake up tomorrow and your ISP not open up to Patriot websites like Prison Planet and others when they declare martial law.
[00:41:38.003 --> 00:41:41.125]  So it's important that people get that immediately and get it out to their friends.
[00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:42.706]  In doing that, though, I got the...
[00:41:43.294 --> 00:41:46.557]  I listened to your program with Colonel Don Grand LaPree and I spoke to him personally.
[00:41:46.578 --> 00:41:50.742]  He gave out his number and we were able to order one of his books and spoke to him about three times.
[00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:58.866]  But I wonder if you might be able to try to get him back as soon as possible as a guest, because... Okay, listen, I really appreciate your call, and I appreciate your support.
[00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:03.249]  If I don't move on, I won't get to any of these other calls, and I promise to just bang through them.
[00:42:03.269 --> 00:42:06.431]  In fact, I'm going to do that now, because I've just got to get to everybody.
[00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:07.692]  Jason in Maryland.
[00:42:07.732 --> 00:42:08.473]  Jason, go ahead.
[00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:09.373]  Hi.
[00:42:09.954 --> 00:42:12.375]  I was wondering if you could... I have two questions.
[00:42:12.716 --> 00:42:18.880]  If you could tell me why Ashcroft, it seems from my understanding, was speaking on both sides of the coin, both...
[00:42:20.124 --> 00:42:21.245]  No, no, no.
[00:42:21.585 --> 00:42:30.908]  I mean, it was the most... It was more in your face, more bald-faced lying than one of my favorite examples that we've played clips of, Rumsfeld saying...
[00:42:41.585 --> 00:42:42.126]  We're good to go.
[00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:42.346]  I think?
[00:43:04.807 --> 00:43:06.509]  Dennis Hastert from the Library of Congress.
[00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.232]  We got the legislative enrollment form.
[00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:09.994]  We got the introduced bill.
[00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:15.582]  And then two months later, he's up there in front of the Senate committee saying...
[00:43:16.497 --> 00:43:18.098]  There is no new Patriot Act 2.
[00:43:18.438 --> 00:43:21.539]  There is no new terrorism legislation, period.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.341]  Anybody that says it is talking about phantoms of lost liberty.
[00:43:25.601 --> 00:43:26.962]  This is a paraphrase, but that's what he said.
[00:43:26.982 --> 00:43:28.723]  He's talking about phantoms of lost liberty.
[00:43:29.003 --> 00:43:30.143]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:43:30.464 --> 00:43:36.466]  They're aiding terrorists, and those that tell these lies will lose their liberties.
[00:43:36.486 --> 00:43:41.689]  And we have about two minutes of his testimony saying that in my film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:43:42.149 --> 00:43:44.370]  And I believe that clip's for free up on the website.
[00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.951]  So, yeah, that's what he's doing.
[00:43:45.971 --> 00:43:49.813]  That's why I want to go back over Patriot Act 2 now that they've passed pieces of.
[00:43:50.153 --> 00:43:54.135]  So people are calling this new one, this new, quote, reauthorization of the old Patriot Act.
[00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.452]  The sun sets a Trojan horse.
[00:43:56.812 --> 00:44:04.300]  All the key provisions, 213, 215, 802, and many others, are not sun-setted in the first Patriot Act.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.943]  Some little tertiary things are sun-setted.
[00:44:06.983 --> 00:44:15.051]  So, when you hear Bush say, reauthorize and strengthen, that means all of Patriot Act II they didn't get, and now even more horrible stuff.
[00:44:16.172 --> 00:44:16.352]  So...
[00:44:18.696 --> 00:44:22.921]  What specifically do you think that means, will lose their liberties?
[00:44:23.102 --> 00:44:24.483]  Well, I mean, it's a threat to those.
[00:44:24.944 --> 00:44:26.826]  They're always talking to three or four different audiences.
[00:44:26.866 --> 00:44:28.168]  Thanks for the call, Jason.
[00:44:28.709 --> 00:44:35.878]  They're always talking to the totally dumbed-down public that doesn't even watch television, might hear the news out of the corner of their ear when they're walking through the shopping mall.
[00:44:36.405 --> 00:44:36.745]  We're good to go.
[00:44:36.765 --> 00:44:37.186]  We're good to go.
[00:45:03.125 --> 00:45:07.066]  And so they will speak to all those groups at once in their speeches.
[00:45:07.566 --> 00:45:13.827]  And then they'll have little threats and ways to terrorize those of us in the know right out in plain view, as I said earlier.
[00:45:14.487 --> 00:45:15.047]  Let's go ahead.
[00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:18.948]  I'm going to go into Patriot Act II later because it's in a secret Senate Intelligence Committee right now.
[00:45:18.968 --> 00:45:21.048]  I'm trying to repass it without any public hearings.
[00:45:21.868 --> 00:45:23.929]  It's too important, you see, for security purposes.
[00:45:24.169 --> 00:45:26.389]  We can't let the public know because you might be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:28.169]  But we're going to leave the borders wide open.
[00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.650]  Don in Texas.
[00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:30.270]  Go ahead, Don.
[00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.950]  All right.
[00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.230]  Hey, yeah.
[00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.912]  You did a good job on that Sam and Bob show, by the way, the other day.
[00:45:36.113 --> 00:45:38.394]  You didn't, you know, you countered all their BS.
[00:45:38.414 --> 00:45:40.175]  Yeah, that was yesterday morning.
[00:45:40.215 --> 00:45:42.436]  I was on KVET Radio, the number one talk show.
[00:45:42.516 --> 00:45:43.437]  Oh, that was the day before.
[00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:43.817]  Yeah.
[00:45:44.257 --> 00:45:45.578]  I guess I have a time lag.
[00:45:45.618 --> 00:45:46.699]  That was yesterday morning, yeah.
[00:45:46.919 --> 00:45:47.039]  Yeah.
[00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:53.653]  And what I was going to say, I don't know if you have anybody on your staff that can read Spanish and speak Spanish pretty well.
[00:45:54.013 --> 00:45:55.774]  Yeah, my wife speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:45:55.814 --> 00:45:56.494]  Oh, yeah, right.
[00:45:56.514 --> 00:46:00.596]  She can speak Arabic, too, probably, and Hebrew and several other things.
[00:46:00.676 --> 00:46:01.337]  You mentioned that.
[00:46:01.577 --> 00:46:03.598]  No, my wife can't speak Arabic or Hebrew.
[00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:05.299]  She can speak fluent.
[00:46:05.319 --> 00:46:06.660]  She has a degree in French.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:07.260]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.122]  She can speak fluent Italian.
[00:46:09.842 --> 00:46:13.805]  She can speak some of the Norwegian languages, some of the northern languages, because she lived there for a few years.
[00:46:13.825 --> 00:46:14.486]  Is that right?
[00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:17.368]  She can speak fluent Spanish, because she lived in Spain for about five years.
[00:46:17.648 --> 00:46:24.474]  Yeah, her dad was an agriculture department, I guess you'd call it bureaucrat, or what's the word?
[00:46:24.514 --> 00:46:25.655]  I'm losing the word.
[00:46:25.795 --> 00:46:26.255]  Diplomat.
[00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:30.599]  Pretty high-level diplomat in several administrations for the agriculture department.
[00:46:31.179 --> 00:46:35.262]  And so she lived, by the time she was about, I think, about seven until 18 in Europe.
[00:46:36.543 --> 00:46:41.968]  And then she went back, she went to UT and then went and got another degree in France at a French university.
[00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:43.489]  So she has a, yeah.
[00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:44.350]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:56.140]  Well, anyway, I have a whole, several huge box fulls of Spanish incendiary and, you know, manipulative periodicals that are put out on a weekly basis, even here in Austin.
[00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:58.414]  And I could drop them off to you.
[00:46:58.574 --> 00:47:00.255]  I've met two or three of your people.
[00:47:00.575 --> 00:47:03.457]  The guy that used to do your carpenter work up at Waco and so forth.
[00:47:03.537 --> 00:47:04.057]  I forgot his name.
[00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:05.478]  I can't call his name up.
[00:47:05.738 --> 00:47:12.742]  Well, sir, I'm fully aware of all those newsstands and those Mexican publications.
[00:47:12.762 --> 00:47:15.183]  Yeah, there's a lot of Lorican Quesa stuff in it, Don.
[00:47:15.203 --> 00:47:17.704]  There's a lot of fabrication and lies in them.
[00:47:18.205 --> 00:47:18.665]  And also...
[00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:27.702]  Have you ever checked into the Babylonian and Sumerian texts that were defiled and messed up?
[00:47:27.722 --> 00:47:35.545]  The museums that were smashed and looted in Iraq, they weren't doing that to get gold and pieces of money or anything like that.
[00:47:35.585 --> 00:47:36.766]  They were trying to destroy it.
[00:47:37.338 --> 00:47:38.178]  Some chronology.
[00:47:38.219 --> 00:47:43.621]  Well, I know that they did loot them and some very rare things worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:47:44.182 --> 00:47:45.823]  It's irreplaceable.
[00:47:46.143 --> 00:47:47.964]  It's not so much the treasure.
[00:47:48.324 --> 00:47:53.407]  It's some of it that depicts ancient information.
[00:47:53.507 --> 00:47:55.988]  Well, that's a little bit above my pay grade, but thanks for the call, Don.
[00:47:56.008 --> 00:47:57.029]  Send me some info on it.
[00:47:57.749 --> 00:47:58.670]  Nathan in Texas.
[00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:59.470]  Nathan, go ahead.
[00:48:02.031 --> 00:48:02.672]  Hello, Nathan.
[00:48:02.992 --> 00:48:03.672]  Yes.
[00:48:03.692 --> 00:48:06.874]  I hate to belabor the point about the illegal immigration thing,
[00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:07.684]  We're good to go.
[00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:39.468]  Well, I've called help phone numbers for customer service, and first it's in Spanish a lot of times, and a lot of cities and counties do that, but now they've got to fly the Mexican flag in Medford, Oregon, above the American flag.
[00:48:39.508 --> 00:48:41.649]  I mean, our government wants this.
[00:48:41.729 --> 00:48:44.290]  They're doing this on purpose.
[00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:45.691]  I'll take it a step further.
[00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:49.633]  I know someone who was in a drunk driving-related accident.
[00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:50.593]  He's a Mexican.
[00:48:51.133 --> 00:48:52.214]  He is from Mexico.
[00:48:52.374 --> 00:48:54.015]  He does not have citizenship here.
[00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:57.609]  He had a terrible injury, and they paid for everything.
[00:48:57.729 --> 00:48:58.269]  The government did.
[00:48:58.289 --> 00:49:04.734]  Sir, I mean, I have a friend who has Crohn's disease, and he had to go back to New York, and his family's paying for it, though they're not wealthy.
[00:49:04.754 --> 00:49:05.514]  They're schoolteachers.
[00:49:06.195 --> 00:49:06.955]  His parents are.
[00:49:07.576 --> 00:49:10.858]  And they would not help him, even though he wanted to pay for as much of it as he could.
[00:49:10.918 --> 00:49:12.079]  But illegal aliens, they admit it.
[00:49:12.119 --> 00:49:13.740]  Yeah, we're told to just pay them.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.562]  And Bush openly last week said the feds are going to pay the states to do this.
[00:49:16.882 --> 00:49:17.922]  They get more health care.
[00:49:17.942 --> 00:49:20.064]  They get more everything.
[00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:21.845]  Free housing.
[00:49:21.985 --> 00:49:22.806]  That was yesterday.
[00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:23.906]  It's not just that.
[00:49:23.986 --> 00:49:24.727]  It goes to the courts.
[00:49:25.187 --> 00:49:32.356]  If you go to a county court, a criminal court, and you look at how many people are being charged with DWI and with other crimes, half of them are illegals.
[00:49:32.897 --> 00:49:36.481]  And it's designed to drive down the wages and balkanize the country.
[00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:37.382]  Listen, listen.
[00:49:37.642 --> 00:49:40.265]  There was an article last year, I keep going back to it, 400,000 violent felons.
[00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:50.755]  In Texas, prisons in one year and jails were ordered, released by the cities, and they were all illegal aliens, mainly from Mexico.
[00:49:50.775 --> 00:49:52.016]  A lot of them were Russians and others.
[00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.138]  They are first-class citizens.
[00:49:54.698 --> 00:49:58.242]  They have set it up to bring all of them here they can to destroy this country.
[00:49:58.482 --> 00:50:00.944]  You heard three congressmen in the last week say it.
[00:50:01.641 --> 00:50:03.463]  You've heard the head of the Border Patrol Union say it.
[00:50:03.843 --> 00:50:05.224]  You've heard Glenn Spencer say it.
[00:50:05.504 --> 00:50:07.186]  I mean, this is not a joke, folks.
[00:50:07.847 --> 00:50:11.029]  The Reuters yesterday said they're getting rid of the border as Pan American Union.
[00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:13.131]  I mean, and it said the CFR has put out the report.
[00:50:13.151 --> 00:50:14.492]  I mean, this is out in the open.
[00:50:14.993 --> 00:50:19.297]  Let me just finish with some graffiti that I have found on the east side of Austin, Texas.
[00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.859]  Texas, S, and the Westboro.
[00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:24.584]  Texas is ours.
[00:50:24.924 --> 00:50:27.988]  That's what they're putting up on the walls in huge block letters.
[00:50:28.088 --> 00:50:28.648]  Sir, I know.
[00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:31.592]  I mean, to go mountain biking, I go on the hiking bike trail.
[00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:32.833]  There's some trails that go off.
[00:50:33.053 --> 00:50:34.695]  And I see the graffiti.
[00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:38.359]  I see official city giant monuments that say that.
[00:50:38.439 --> 00:50:40.361]  I mean, it is, again, the government funding all of it.
[00:50:40.642 --> 00:50:42.524]  And our mayor, Gus Garcia, a few years ago...
[00:50:43.177 --> 00:50:45.378]  Well, I'll tell you what he did before he left office.
[00:50:45.438 --> 00:50:46.359]  I mean, I've got it on video.
[00:50:46.379 --> 00:50:47.659]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:50:47.699 --> 00:50:48.399]  Great points, Nathan.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.081]  Chris in Illinois and others, your calls are up next.
[00:50:51.121 --> 00:50:56.323]  Again, ring with your calls right here on the GCN Radio Network, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[00:50:56.903 --> 00:50:57.604]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:57.624 --> 00:51:00.665]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.646 --> 00:51:05.988]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.148 --> 00:51:10.510]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:13.553 --> 00:51:16.517]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.279 --> 00:51:22.505]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.565 --> 00:51:29.514]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.634 --> 00:51:31.657]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.897 --> 00:51:42.422]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.602 --> 00:51:47.985]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:52:05.358 --> 00:52:10.803]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.083 --> 00:52:21.451]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.611 --> 00:52:25.955]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.135 --> 00:52:34.500]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:41.064]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odor.

[00:54:10.343 --> 00:54:24.008]  I'm going to continue taking your calls into the next hour, and throughout the broadcast today I will spend the last 30 minutes getting into the structure of the New World Order and what their goals are and how they operate and what their driving ideology and philosophy is.
[00:54:25.809 --> 00:54:34.912]  But after I take about five more calls into the next hour, then I'm going to spend some time on the Patriot Act II and a bunch of the current news, including the Mexican flag above the American flag.
[00:54:37.054 --> 00:54:38.916]  They think they've got it bad in Medford, Oregon.
[00:54:39.396 --> 00:54:41.077]  Again, San Antonio Express News.
[00:54:41.958 --> 00:54:43.920]  The series was first back in 1998.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.021]  It was like a... I keep saying a five-part series.
[00:54:46.041 --> 00:54:47.623]  It was a ten-part series.
[00:54:48.163 --> 00:54:49.985]  Actually telling us how it was pretty good.
[00:54:50.025 --> 00:54:50.925]  What was the reason for it?
[00:54:51.366 --> 00:54:52.807]  The first town was El Cenizo.
[00:54:53.427 --> 00:54:55.369]  Back in the mid-90s, it flies the Mexican flag.
[00:54:55.389 --> 00:54:57.391]  A town of about 20,000 there in the little county.
[00:54:58.151 --> 00:55:00.113]  And no English is allowed to be spoken in court.
[00:55:00.153 --> 00:55:00.974]  That is a rule.
[00:55:01.374 --> 00:55:02.555]  And the Mexican flag flies.
[00:55:02.575 --> 00:55:03.756]  The American flag doesn't even fly.
[00:55:04.324 --> 00:55:06.569]  I've got to go down to El Cenizo and show that on video.
[00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.557]  I'll never forget that photo on the front page of the San Antonio Express News.
[00:55:10.577 --> 00:55:11.720]  They had a big series.
[00:55:12.355 --> 00:55:15.276]  Well, they started out saying it was bad by the end of the ten-part series.
[00:55:15.296 --> 00:55:17.577]  I remember I read most of the ten-part series on air.
[00:55:18.057 --> 00:55:19.698]  It was like, oh, it's good, you know.
[00:55:20.078 --> 00:55:28.262]  Well, Mayor Gus Garcia, and again, I don't care if we have mayors that are black, white, purple, green, polka-dotted with, you know, pig's wings flapping around.
[00:55:28.302 --> 00:55:29.182]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:55:29.282 --> 00:55:33.744]  We have Eskimos, you know, Inuits as our mayors or whatever, as long as they love America.
[00:55:33.844 --> 00:55:34.524]  I don't care!
[00:55:35.605 --> 00:55:37.005]  Again, my best friend's Hispanic.
[00:55:38.326 --> 00:55:40.707]  And most Hispanics aren't like this, but Mayor Gus Garcia...
[00:55:41.795 --> 00:55:43.536]  Another one of these Mecha La Reconquistas.
[00:55:44.096 --> 00:55:45.797]  I've got it on video.
[00:55:46.378 --> 00:56:01.146]  Before he left office about three or four years ago, he gets up there, and they had a proclamation for Mecha, and he read this God race proclamation, and they had these people dressed up like Aztecs out in the audience, and it was how they were the superior supreme race.
[00:56:01.527 --> 00:56:03.688]  I mean, folks, this is unacceptable.
[00:56:03.888 --> 00:56:05.309]  Bottom line.
[00:56:06.081 --> 00:56:06.461]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:06.481 --> 00:56:07.422]  I was just...
[00:56:35.876 --> 00:56:48.211]  Just to... I want to get this out in the open and out over with because me and my friend were discussing it and we... I don't think so, but I went to your Sacred Cow Productions website.
[00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:49.272]  That's not my website, sir.
[00:56:49.793 --> 00:56:50.253]  Okay, well...
[00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:53.963]  Your name and your face was, like, on it.
[00:56:54.183 --> 00:56:56.145]  Yeah, no, he taped my TV show and put it on.
[00:56:56.165 --> 00:56:56.805]  I think that's great.
[00:56:56.825 --> 00:57:00.928]  They're about, I don't know, I've probably seen 500 websites that have got my video.
[00:57:01.288 --> 00:57:02.009]  Oh, okay.
[00:57:02.389 --> 00:57:03.770]  But no, I mean, I know Kevin Booth.
[00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:04.530]  He's a friend of mine.
[00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:05.891]  They produced your video.
[00:57:06.512 --> 00:57:13.297]  No, Kevin went to New York with me to shoot camera, and he did pay for some of the expenses, so yes, he got a production credit.
[00:57:13.377 --> 00:57:14.137]  Yeah, okay.
[00:57:14.477 --> 00:57:19.521]  Well, the thing about it is, their symbol, when I went there, it was a cow's head.
[00:57:20.177 --> 00:57:23.320]  And it totally looked like a pentagram.
[00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.643]  Sir, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:57:28.464 --> 00:57:29.425]  Sacred cow.
[00:57:29.545 --> 00:57:31.247]  Breaking sacred cows.
[00:57:32.488 --> 00:57:37.812]  Breaking the sacred cows of criticizing the government, of criticizing the drug war.
[00:57:38.693 --> 00:57:40.555]  Things of that nature.
[00:57:41.215 --> 00:57:43.257]  My symbol is not a cow, sir.
[00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:45.159]  It's a Brahma bull.
[00:57:45.925 --> 00:57:46.426]  We're good to go.
[00:58:08.087 --> 00:58:09.268]  We're good to go.
[00:58:30.763 --> 00:58:35.584]  When I said New World Order, I played a big pyramid blue screen behind me, and people said, oh, that's Secret Illuminati.
[00:58:35.824 --> 00:58:37.104]  No, it's not Secret Illuminati.
[00:58:37.304 --> 00:58:39.005]  I said New World Order and showed a pyramid.
[00:58:39.565 --> 00:58:41.305]  Yes, we're talking about the New World Order.
[00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.025]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:43.045 --> 00:58:45.666]  It's like somebody called me yesterday saying George Arwell's bad.
[00:58:45.726 --> 00:58:47.346]  I mean, no, George Arwell's good.
[00:58:51.707 --> 00:59:00.249]  Introducing... Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:01.142 --> 00:59:04.985]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.733 --> 00:59:30.117]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now into our number two wide-open phones today.
[00:59:30.157 --> 00:59:31.478]  Don't have any guests joining us.
[00:59:32.238 --> 00:59:33.239]  Just taking your calls.
[00:59:33.359 --> 00:59:37.221]  I'm coming to you, actually, from Minnesota, right outside Minneapolis-St.
[00:59:37.261 --> 00:59:40.643]  Paul, the little hamlet of Burnsville.
[00:59:40.663 --> 00:59:42.604]  And the toll-free number to join us...
[00:59:43.319 --> 00:59:43.379]  1-800-259-9231
[01:00:06.677 --> 01:00:06.917]  Right now...
[01:00:35.205 --> 01:00:36.746]  Let's go to Walt in Kansas City.
[01:00:37.307 --> 01:00:38.448]  Walt, good to hear from you, sir.
[01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:39.108]  What's on your mind?
[01:00:39.389 --> 01:00:40.670]  Hey, God bless you, Alex.
[01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.212]  I hope everything's fine for you.
[01:00:43.752 --> 01:00:44.633]  It's going great, yeah?
[01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.174]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.
[01:00:46.235 --> 01:00:47.295]  Hopefully it'll go better.
[01:00:47.315 --> 01:00:49.918]  I just want to give out a little information.
[01:00:50.118 --> 01:00:56.163]  I want to thank you for giving me a little advice a year or two ago about a pilot's perspective on 911.
[01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:05.661]  And you know, I deal with air freight and trucking, you know, airplanes, classic cars, all this kind of stuff, motorcycles and everything.
[01:01:06.461 --> 01:01:25.175]  Well, not one pilot that I have found actually believes that those planes were... You know, in other words, they can't imagine how someone would fly them into a building and then again, you've got these Muslims...
[01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:29.671]  That would actually get out of a Cessna and climb into a 757.
[01:01:31.593 --> 01:01:48.041]  Well, actually, Muhammad Atta, when he was creating his ledger, you know, the background story of how he was this great flyer, just a few months before the attacks, they were out on a Cessna, threw fits, and jumped out on the runway with the thing still running because they couldn't even control it or make it work.
[01:01:48.482 --> 01:01:51.243]  They couldn't even get a Cessna off the ground, sir.
[01:01:51.523 --> 01:01:52.504]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[01:01:52.684 --> 01:01:54.165]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:54.385 --> 01:01:58.907]  But then with three separate flights, they thread the needle and T-bone precisely enough...
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:06.353]  I've had so many pilots walk up to me on the street and say, Alex, I fly for America.
[01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:07.234]  I fly for United.
[01:02:07.294 --> 01:02:08.694]  I fly for Southwest.
[01:02:08.914 --> 01:02:10.195]  We couldn't fly like that.
[01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:11.856]  It's ridiculous.
[01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:16.658]  Especially the Pentagon coming in just 20 feet off the deck at full speed.
[01:02:16.798 --> 01:02:26.883]  Everybody knows you've got to slow down when you come down to the ground because the atmosphere is thicker and there's a wind shear and a pressure of air that presses down on the ground and it pushes the plane up.
[01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:28.284]  You've got to slow down
[01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.104]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:29.124 --> 01:02:30.365]  Well, see, that's what I get at.
[01:02:30.385 --> 01:02:34.548]  And, of course, one of the first things I ask people is where was the wreckage of the plane from the Pentagon?
[01:02:34.568 --> 01:02:37.029]  We got a 125-foot wingspan, a 55-by-60 tail section, and a 40-foot hole.
[01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:09.575]  And I remind everybody, too, that any of the top admirals or generals, and I know what you said, but you see, most people aren't aware that they were ordered not to be able to order the shoot-down.
[01:03:10.095 --> 01:03:15.657]  Any of the top admirals or generals can give the shoot-down order, but only one man can order a stand-down.
[01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:24.401]  They could until three months before, and we have that in the new film, the official Pentagon document where Dick Cheney ordered Rumsfeld to take the authority away from NORAD and the Pentagon.
[01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:25.301]  Yeah.
[01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:27.201]  Hey, listen, great point.
[01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:28.502]  Sure, Walt, what?
[01:03:28.902 --> 01:03:35.863]  I want to give a location where people can get your tapes this weekend for free at a car show.
[01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:37.884]  Okay, where's that going to be?
[01:03:37.964 --> 01:03:40.584]  Wyandotte County Fairgrounds, Saturday only.
[01:03:40.704 --> 01:03:43.145]  Come get all Alex Jones' tapes for free.
[01:03:43.225 --> 01:03:44.905]  I've got about 60 of them recorded.
[01:03:45.085 --> 01:03:45.925]  Good job, Walt.
[01:03:45.965 --> 01:03:46.865]  Keep it up, my friend.
[01:03:47.906 --> 01:03:49.746]  All right, we'll be right back with more of your calls and more news.
[01:03:53.354 --> 01:03:54.854]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.054 --> 01:03:58.135]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.275 --> 01:04:02.176]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.216 --> 01:04:06.457]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.797 --> 01:04:10.578]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.718 --> 01:04:12.519]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:16.020]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:20.761]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:23.982]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.142 --> 01:04:27.023]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.503 --> 01:04:33.625]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.145 --> 01:04:35.987]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:04:53.377 --> 01:04:56.360]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:05.547]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:05.867 --> 01:05:10.551]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:17.734]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:29.900]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:34.844]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:35.004 --> 01:05:37.466]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:37.486 --> 01:05:39.327]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:39.347 --> 01:05:40.548]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.608 --> 01:05:42.069]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:42.089 --> 01:05:43.150]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.160]  We're good to go.
[01:06:12.392 --> 01:06:18.476]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:18.636 --> 01:06:19.876]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:20.197 --> 01:06:23.158]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:23.298 --> 01:06:24.199]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:24.279 --> 01:06:25.299]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:32.884]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:33.164 --> 01:06:36.566]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:43.870]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:44.551]  You want answers?
[01:06:44.631 --> 01:06:45.491]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.908 --> 01:07:09.829]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:14.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.311 --> 01:07:32.514]  Coming up, coming up in the second half of the last hour, I'm going to spend about 30 minutes on the structure of the New World Order, how they gain control of this country and what their future plans are, and hopefully some tactics to try to stop them.
[01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:40.339]  But we're going to continue going to your calls right after I cover some news here for a few minutes.
[01:07:40.859 --> 01:07:43.040]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:43.120]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.320]  Before I jump into the news and the latest analysis on Patriot Act II...
[01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:58.111]  Where that legislation is right now in secret committee.
[01:07:58.131 --> 01:08:01.195]  Let's get one of the callers that's been holding for a while out of the way.
[01:08:01.556 --> 01:08:02.457]  Chris in Illinois.
[01:08:02.497 --> 01:08:03.158]  Welcome, Chris.
[01:08:03.198 --> 01:08:03.458]  Hi.
[01:08:03.518 --> 01:08:05.781]  I just called and I called back.
[01:08:07.363 --> 01:08:08.385]  I have an idea.
[01:08:08.405 --> 01:08:10.748]  And you're going to think I'm nuts.
[01:08:11.449 --> 01:08:12.670]  Sir, I'm going to let you go.
[01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:19.895]  We only have callers on one time per show, and I guess this isn't calling in with another name or something.
[01:08:20.195 --> 01:08:20.976]  Perhaps it's the same name.
[01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:23.898]  That's why I thought we hadn't gone to a call that had been there for 30 minutes.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:35.426]  Again, my friends, you get one call per day, and because if I sit there and let somebody call back in, I'm never going to get to all of the callers.
[01:08:36.087 --> 01:08:36.407]  All right?
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:42.663]  In fact, I probably shouldn't even be going to calls until I finish all this news, but I always do enjoy taking your calls.
[01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:43.264]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:43.324 --> 01:08:51.428]  And again, if I sound a little bit different, I'm not going down some digital computer lines from my studio in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:51.468 --> 01:08:53.790]  I'm up here in Burnsville, Minnesota.
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:58.592]  I'm up here at the headquarters of the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:59.693 --> 01:09:04.856]  Oh, by the way, that little clip, 20-minute clip from my TV show, my hour-long TV show that I did...
[01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:06.215]  We're good to go.
[01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:23.868]  We're good to go.
[01:09:23.888 --> 01:09:24.588]  We're good to go.
[01:09:24.608 --> 01:09:25.028]  We're good to go.
[01:09:46.873 --> 01:09:51.916]  Hundreds of articles that I've seen and people have been calling and saying that they're drawing the parallels on television.
[01:09:52.236 --> 01:09:57.059]  But they're only drawing the parallels between the Iraq war and a false threat as a pretext.
[01:09:57.079 --> 01:10:00.761]  They're not drawing the parallels between dark, secret societies, the occult.
[01:10:01.142 --> 01:10:05.424]  They're not drawing parallels between just a lot of other key issues.
[01:10:05.444 --> 01:10:10.447]  That's why I've written this article and also done this hilarious, I think it's funny, spoof piece.
[01:10:11.027 --> 01:10:15.250]  So you're welcome to watch that and then call in with your reviews of it.
[01:10:15.919 --> 01:10:29.211]  Okay, before I get into Patriot Act 2 and my analysis that I wrote a couple years ago in the latest developments there, let me just give you today's backdrop on the police state.
[01:10:29.231 --> 01:10:33.374]  I can only cover a fraction of these articles.
[01:10:33.414 --> 01:10:34.275]  There's so many of them.
[01:10:35.396 --> 01:10:39.840]  Pastor who bought books online got FBI filed.
[01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:46.874]  And they put these reports out to have a chilling effect and scare people away from knowledge and information.
[01:10:47.334 --> 01:10:48.736]  He's a Christian pastor.
[01:10:49.576 --> 01:10:51.718]  Kentucky Courier-Journal.
[01:10:51.858 --> 01:10:58.644]  Raymond Payne first learned that the FBI might be interested in him when he tried to cross the border into Canada last fall for some sightseeing.
[01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:08.373]  Payne, who is a pastor in Meade Memorial United Methodist Church in Russell in eastern Kentucky, said he and his wife were stopped by the Canadian Border Patrol and questioned for about 90 minutes.
[01:11:09.955 --> 01:11:13.580]  The Canadians told the Paynes that he was the subject of an FBI file.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.005]  He said in a telephone interview Wednesday that that bothered him.
[01:11:17.065 --> 01:11:21.131]  He said because he was never been charged with a crime or been politically active.
[01:11:22.037 --> 01:11:24.380]  Well, why should he be in a file if he's politically active?
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:40.516]  But Payne now thinks that an internet book ordered that he placed after September 11, 2001 terror attacks some reading material about Islam and several copies of the Koran for his congregation's comparative studies of religions may tie into the agency's interest.
[01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:41.898]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:11:42.558 --> 01:11:48.482]  I want to know if that file exists, and if so, I want to know why, Payne said.
[01:11:48.502 --> 01:11:53.545]  If it was because I ordered some books on the Internet, then that seems to be a very disturbing thing.
[01:11:54.105 --> 01:11:57.828]  I heard a talk show host that I was arguing with just yesterday in Austin.
[01:11:57.868 --> 01:12:02.831]  I was on a show, and Bob Cole came in, and he's going, well, we need to be able to.
[01:12:03.829 --> 01:12:06.070]  He said this before I even got on air as I was driving into the studio.
[01:12:06.491 --> 01:12:16.677]  He said, we need to be able to have the FBI look at all your library records because why somebody, a terrorist, might write something in a book and then we need to know what he wrote in the margin of the book.
[01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:18.398]  The FBI used that example.
[01:12:19.038 --> 01:12:20.219]  What people are checking out.
[01:12:20.259 --> 01:12:24.622]  It's ridiculous while the Border Patrol has been ordered to stand down.
[01:12:25.322 --> 01:12:28.144]  It doesn't hold two drops of water.
[01:12:29.685 --> 01:12:30.446]  It's unbelievable.
[01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.567]  But look, regardless of what happened with this case...
[01:12:33.371 --> 01:12:33.771]  We're good to go.
[01:12:57.592 --> 01:12:59.934]  That has actually even been in the news.
[01:13:00.095 --> 01:13:08.743]  A lot of check-cashing places and other places are just shutting down, saying, we've read the Patriot Act 1 compliance rules, and there's no way to comply with this.
[01:13:10.825 --> 01:13:12.667]  Just type Patriot Act compliance.
[01:13:13.653 --> 01:13:21.018]  Into a search engine, and literally tens of thousands, if not more, links will pop up with how businesses can follow the new rules.
[01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:38.329]  When you call to get a prescription for anything, it could be a diaphragm, it could be steroid cream for a skin infection, it could be prescription strength ibuprofen, anything, it instantly is uploaded into federal and state databases.
[01:13:38.389 --> 01:13:42.212]  And now I've got a stack of reports here where the federal government is running around
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.582]  Here's an article today out of ABC News.
[01:13:46.602 --> 01:13:48.484]  Cashless society wave and pay with a wireless credit card.
[01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:14.532]  And the comment, I guess this is from Paul Watson, he wrote this on PrisonPlanet.com, above the article, isn't it amazing, but some would say not surprising, that the very founders of the debit-based phony fiat money system and Federal Reserve, Chase and J.P.
[01:14:14.572 --> 01:14:17.633]  Morgan, are the forefront of the cashless society B system.
[01:14:17.673 --> 01:14:20.815]  Remember in 2005, the chip was embedded in your credit card by 2010.
[01:14:21.335 --> 01:14:23.736]  It may well be embedded in your hand.
[01:14:24.717 --> 01:14:25.657]  Oh, the convenience!
[01:14:25.737 --> 01:14:28.639]  And the article starts, In this week's Cyber Shake...
[01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:34.273]  We take a look at the new credit card system that lets customers pay for things with a simple wave.
[01:14:34.713 --> 01:14:39.274]  You've all seen this at the Tiger Marts, and McDonald's is doing this in some areas.
[01:14:39.314 --> 01:14:40.255]  We have a little keychain.
[01:14:40.575 --> 01:14:41.555]  This is in the card itself.
[01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:49.277]  Plus we track how Tiger, Apple's new operating system software, is doing in the wild world of Mac users.
[01:14:49.992 --> 01:14:54.556]  And then it goes into how you just don't even have to pull your wallet out.
[01:14:54.576 --> 01:14:57.478]  It just instantly scans your chip.
[01:14:57.958 --> 01:15:07.245]  And on Thursday, Chase Bank announced a new payment system called Blink that the company believes could offer the speed of paper with the convenience of plastic.
[01:15:07.265 --> 01:15:14.391]  The new technology is essentially a credit card embedded with a radio frequency identification device, or RFID, microchip that contains encoded data.
[01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:17.974]  To pay for a purchase, consumers merely wave the card
[01:15:18.254 --> 01:15:19.675]  So you see this whole transformation taking place.
[01:15:19.695 --> 01:15:20.856]  And under the new Homeland Security Act,
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:53.562]  Real ID Act, the feds are going to put chips through federal standardization of driver's license and all the driver's license and ID cards, and this will all begin in earnest.
[01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:56.143]  And that starts by law in two years.
[01:15:56.263 --> 01:15:58.103]  They're going to start phasing it in now.
[01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:01.424]  Already a lot of states already have these chips embedded.
[01:16:01.764 --> 01:16:04.805]  Meanwhile, again, the border's been ordered to stand down, the Border Patrol.
[01:16:05.205 --> 01:16:07.905]  Meanwhile, who is the FBI really worried about?
[01:16:07.925 --> 01:16:09.766]  Who do they say the biggest threat is?
[01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:13.250]  Here's the headline out of the Globe and Mail out of Canada.
[01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:16.471]  FBI calls animal rights activists worst terror threat.
[01:16:17.731 --> 01:16:22.713]  And yes, they have burned down, I don't know, scores of times, laboratories.
[01:16:23.273 --> 01:16:25.154]  No one's ever been hurt, thank God that I know of.
[01:16:25.174 --> 01:16:27.515]  Environmental activists spike trees.
[01:16:27.555 --> 01:16:29.675]  That has killed people when they're chainsawing through them.
[01:16:30.856 --> 01:16:32.656]  It is criminal behavior, criminal mischief.
[01:16:32.716 --> 01:16:34.357]  And if somebody gets hurt, it's manslaughter.
[01:16:35.932 --> 01:16:37.614]  We do have problems with this.
[01:16:51.952 --> 01:16:55.755]  To say that it's the worst threat and see how they're widening the terror net.
[01:16:55.855 --> 01:16:58.837]  Conservatives hear this and go, good, charge them with terrorism.
[01:16:58.877 --> 01:17:04.461]  Meanwhile, the real handbooks, the real training for police and the FBI and others is that it's evil conservatives.
[01:17:04.481 --> 01:17:05.762]  They're the ones that have to be dealt with.
[01:17:06.243 --> 01:17:09.445]  FBI calls animal rights activists worst terror threat.
[01:17:10.186 --> 01:17:17.952]  Environmental and animal rights activists who have turned to arson and explosives are the nation's top domestic terrorism threat, an FBI official told the U.S.
[01:17:17.973 --> 01:17:19.194]  Senate committee on Wednesday.
[01:17:19.574 --> 01:17:25.579]  Groups such as Animal Liberation Front, the Earth Liberation Front, and Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty
[01:17:26.379 --> 01:17:32.842]  Way out in front in terms of damage and number of crimes, said John Lewis, the FBI's Deputy Assistant Director for Counterterrorism.
[01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:40.185]  There is nothing else going on in this country over the last several years that is racking up the number of violent crimes and terrorist actions, Mr. Lewis said.
[01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:52.069]  And the AFL says on its website that its small anonymous group of people take direct action against animal abuse by resurrecting animals, rescuing animals, and causing financial loss to animal exploiters.
[01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.330]  Now let's just stop right there.
[01:17:54.477 --> 01:17:57.942]  Folks, I am against the so-called animal rights movement.
[01:17:58.903 --> 01:18:00.545]  I mean, they don't want you having leather shoes.
[01:18:00.565 --> 01:18:02.107]  They don't want you eating beef or poultry.
[01:18:02.788 --> 01:18:03.869]  They don't want you eating fish.
[01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.513]  They say mackerel is worth more than newborn babies.
[01:18:06.913 --> 01:18:08.255]  That's one of the animal rights leaders.
[01:18:10.077 --> 01:18:10.939]  They're at Princeton.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:12.701]  I mean, they're out of control.
[01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.800]  And the media supports them and acts like they're good at that level.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.461]  I even heard Paul Harvey, you know, constant animal rights propaganda.
[01:18:19.681 --> 01:18:21.041]  But I am against abusing animals.
[01:18:21.061 --> 01:18:26.623]  I mean, I think the monkeys with the wires in their heads at UT and all over the country, that's really abusive and bad.
[01:18:26.643 --> 01:18:29.764]  I think a lot of this stuff that's going on is really out of control.
[01:18:31.365 --> 01:18:33.825]  And that really does show how terrorism is almost non-existent.
[01:18:33.845 --> 01:18:39.747]  The biggest threat are a few instances a year of a house getting burned down or a car getting burned.
[01:18:39.767 --> 01:18:40.787]  And that's bad.
[01:18:40.987 --> 01:18:42.548]  But I don't know if you'd call it terrorism.
[01:18:44.002 --> 01:18:48.663]  Because under terrorism, your rights to do process are stripped, and I'm against that happening to anybody.
[01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:51.984]  We'll get into more calls and the Patriot Act, too, when we get back.
[01:18:52.004 --> 01:18:53.124]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.544 --> 01:18:58.965]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[01:18:59.105 --> 01:19:07.427]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:19:07.647 --> 01:19:09.247]  More than likely, this includes you.
[01:19:09.427 --> 01:19:12.528]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.
[01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:13.088]  I think so.
[01:19:34.906 --> 01:19:47.436]  Search your fight against mineral deficiency by calling toll-free 866-989-9876 or visit MotherEarthMineralsInc.com and order Dr. Ott's book, Secret Assassins and Food, to learn more about the chemicals in food that are attacking you daily.
[01:19:47.596 --> 01:19:49.477]  Again, call 866-989-9876 or visit MotherEarthMineralsInc.com.
[01:19:54.369 --> 01:20:03.435]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:20:03.695 --> 01:20:14.923]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:20:15.263 --> 01:20:20.967]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:21.867]  We're good to go.
[01:20:52.843 --> 01:20:54.004]  Why do you wear watches?
[01:20:54.304 --> 01:20:56.924]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[01:20:57.384 --> 01:21:05.046]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[01:21:05.406 --> 01:21:09.187]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[01:21:09.647 --> 01:21:11.948]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches...
[01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:12.728]  We're good to go.
[01:21:35.339 --> 01:21:38.422]  Free shipping and secure transaction is standard with every order.
[01:21:38.662 --> 01:21:41.545]  So visit DiscountWatchStore.com slash radio today.
[01:21:41.826 --> 01:21:44.528]  That is DiscountWatchStore.com slash radio.
[01:21:44.849 --> 01:21:45.569]  Or call toll free 866-371-2330.
[01:21:45.589 --> 01:21:45.910]  That's 866-371-2330.
[01:21:52.862 --> 01:21:56.526]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:21:56.926 --> 01:22:02.351]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:02.812 --> 01:22:03.913]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:03.933 --> 01:22:07.977]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:08.617 --> 01:22:21.921]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:27.742]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:33.864]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:22:34.565 --> 01:22:34.625]  1-800-686-2237
[01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:57.042]  Don't worry.
[01:22:57.503 --> 01:22:59.083]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.544 --> 01:23:05.427]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.587 --> 01:23:09.669]  Issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[01:23:09.889 --> 01:23:14.191]  We'll go to Skunk and Kenneth and Dale and Bob and Nick.
[01:23:14.251 --> 01:23:15.592]  It'd be nice to have some women call in.
[01:23:15.832 --> 01:23:16.272]  You never know.
[01:23:16.332 --> 01:23:19.814]  Some days you'll have all women call in, but most of the time it's about 80% of the time.
[01:23:20.134 --> 01:23:20.955]  What would you say, John?
[01:23:20.975 --> 01:23:22.676]  Yeah, about 80% of the time?
[01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:24.077]  Women?
[01:23:24.537 --> 01:23:24.978]  I mean, men.
[01:23:24.998 --> 01:23:27.519]  I always like to get the female perspective on things.
[01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:28.580]  Like women in the military.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.801]  It's really being promoted now by Lord Bush.
[01:23:30.861 --> 01:23:34.923]  There's a bill in Congress that claims it would restrict it, but really doesn't.
[01:23:34.983 --> 01:23:38.165]  Puts them into more combat roles than ever before.
[01:23:38.745 --> 01:23:42.087]  But I guess that's okay, because Bush is supposedly conservative and everything's alright.
[01:23:42.487 --> 01:23:43.648]  We can all go back to sleep now.
[01:23:45.029 --> 01:23:51.715]  Coming up, after I take some calls, I will get into Patriot Act 2, and really Patriot Act 2.5, you should call it, because they've already passed some of it.
[01:23:52.115 --> 01:23:56.499]  Now it's in a secret committee right now, and I want to go over some of the actual subsections that are in this bill.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.322]  But right now, I'm going to go very quickly to your call.
[01:23:59.462 --> 01:24:01.223]  Skunk in Missouri.
[01:24:01.243 --> 01:24:01.944]  Skunk, go ahead.
[01:24:02.224 --> 01:24:03.065]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:24:03.165 --> 01:24:03.405]  Good.
[01:24:04.146 --> 01:24:05.988]  I just wanted to fly a kite to you real quick.
[01:24:06.028 --> 01:24:10.351]  I caught something on the news last night that, you know, it bothered me and concerned me.
[01:24:10.371 --> 01:24:11.913]  It was about Six Flag Parks.
[01:24:13.299 --> 01:24:28.188]  I didn't catch the entire news broadcast on it, but they were saying something to the effect that they were going to be scanning people's IDs to weed out sex offenders in the parks to protect
[01:24:28.587 --> 01:24:29.107]  The children.
[01:24:29.207 --> 01:24:37.411]  My thought is, if this is true, and I mean I caught it from a major news agency at CBS News, local here in Kansas City.
[01:24:38.352 --> 01:24:44.675]  My question is, if this is true, how long before they scan your ID and on your way out of the park you're getting picked up for parking tickets?
[01:24:45.035 --> 01:24:45.756]  You're getting picked up.
[01:24:45.876 --> 01:24:46.776]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:24:46.816 --> 01:24:55.201]  No, no, this has been the plan all along, and I have heard that in other areas, other businesses, and it'll be grocery stores, it'll be malls.
[01:24:55.802 --> 01:25:04.347]  This morning at about 6 a.m., I had the radio on here in Minnesota, or about 7 a.m., and I was listening, and it was all about how...
[01:25:05.373 --> 01:25:14.197]  They're going to be basically scanning and checking IDs of young people who won't be able to go to the malls, teenagers unattended.
[01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:20.500]  And again, it all sounds reasonable, but it all gets us used to basically living in this type of scenario where everything's like the airports.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:28.463]  And the FBI said last year they want all malls with a checkpoint where everyone's ID is checked and where cameras take digital photos of everyone coming into the malls.
[01:25:28.783 --> 01:25:30.664]  So that's already past the sex offenders.
[01:25:30.684 --> 01:25:41.570]  But see, they pick an unsavory group that 99.999% of us hate, that we all find despicable, and go, let's take their rights, and then see, it's going to be used against everybody.
[01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:44.412]  Oh, we're going to put bracelets for life around the sex offenders.
[01:25:44.592 --> 01:25:45.773]  How about keep them in jail for life?
[01:25:45.993 --> 01:25:49.435]  No, no, we're going to release them, but now we're going to put bracelets around them.
[01:25:49.575 --> 01:25:51.756]  But then it's going to be everybody else for any other crime.
[01:25:52.116 --> 01:25:55.158]  And I know that Disneyland, Disney World...
[01:25:55.638 --> 01:26:03.787]  I know that another big chain, SeaWorld, the Anheuser-Busch parks, I know that they hand scan you.
[01:26:03.807 --> 01:26:06.490]  I mean, I got video of this myself at their parks.
[01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:07.931]  This is going in everywhere.
[01:26:07.991 --> 01:26:12.656]  Thousands of school districts, again, thumb scan to get school lunches, no cash allowed.
[01:26:12.976 --> 01:26:14.338]  So a really great point, Skunk.
[01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:16.920]  Skunk, why don't you email that to Paul Watson?
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:17.621]  Go to prisonplanet.com.
[01:26:18.482 --> 01:26:18.982]  Yeah, welcome.
[01:26:19.002 --> 01:26:22.983]  I just wanted to say, though, why can't people figure out what exactly is going on in this world?
[01:26:23.023 --> 01:26:25.204]  I mean, it's like you try to explain to people at work.
[01:26:25.264 --> 01:26:27.284]  I'm not saying to people at work what's going on with the New World Order.
[01:26:27.304 --> 01:26:27.864]  I think it's
[01:26:47.955 --> 01:26:54.960]  You're saying government should be watched?
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.841]  You're saying government shouldn't be totally trusted?
[01:26:56.861 --> 01:26:57.602]  You're crazy!
[01:26:58.062 --> 01:27:03.466]  I suggest you go read the Declaration of Independence to them and then say, is this not what's happening here in America today?
[01:27:04.087 --> 01:27:10.391]  Well, that's because deep down, look, look, look, if what you were saying wasn't true, they wouldn't get upset.
[01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:18.411]  But it's the fact that they engage you deep down.
[01:27:18.451 --> 01:27:20.332]  They know that something's wrong with the world.
[01:27:21.073 --> 01:27:22.414]  And look, it's not everybody.
[01:27:22.454 --> 01:27:24.255]  Maybe in your corner of the world that's happening.
[01:27:24.555 --> 01:27:27.436]  But major polls show the majority don't trust the media.
[01:27:27.737 --> 01:27:28.837]  They don't trust the government.
[01:27:28.857 --> 01:27:30.338]  People know they're being lied to.
[01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:35.741]  I find, I mean, almost everybody I talk to knows what's going on.
[01:27:36.061 --> 01:27:39.023]  You will find little conclaves or little areas of idiots.
[01:27:39.383 --> 01:27:40.984]  And I suggest not wasting your time.
[01:27:41.344 --> 01:27:44.166]  Move on to people that want to hear the truth, that want to know what's really going on.
[01:27:44.662 --> 01:27:45.605]  Yeah.
[01:27:45.666 --> 01:27:51.705]  It's one thing I realized, too, that sometimes some of the people that you may be explaining this to
[01:27:52.256 --> 01:27:55.259]  They may be involved with the New World Order.
[01:27:55.299 --> 01:27:57.001]  A lot of them aren't.
[01:27:57.321 --> 01:28:01.625]  The main thing is most people aren't involved, quote, actively, consciously with the New World Order.
[01:28:02.126 --> 01:28:04.568]  They just feel like they're part of the system.
[01:28:04.909 --> 01:28:06.951]  They believe in the system because they're good people.
[01:28:06.971 --> 01:28:08.212]  They're not evil, they think.
[01:28:08.272 --> 01:28:09.914]  So you're calling the system evil.
[01:28:09.934 --> 01:28:10.895]  You're calling them evil.
[01:28:10.935 --> 01:28:11.515]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:11.535 --> 01:28:14.058]  It's like that police chief I interviewed last week.
[01:28:14.098 --> 01:28:15.079]  I re-aired it yesterday.
[01:28:17.332 --> 01:28:21.314]  The county chief there in Bergen County, New Jersey, and he goes, yeah, I am the government.
[01:28:21.354 --> 01:28:21.915]  I'll take a chip.
[01:28:22.135 --> 01:28:23.016]  I've taken a chip.
[01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:25.097]  And he goes, I don't care if the government makes us take chips.
[01:28:25.117 --> 01:28:25.978]  You know, that's a good thing.
[01:28:26.378 --> 01:28:28.419]  I mean, it's just this craziness.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:39.527]  All right, we'll come back, and we'll get into Patriot Act 2, and we'll get into more of your calls after a quick little five-minute special guest is going to be joining us in studio.
[01:28:39.587 --> 01:28:40.968]  I'm looking at him right now.
[01:28:43.923 --> 01:28:44.805]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.306 --> 01:28:46.910]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.832 --> 01:28:50.518]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.468 --> 01:28:54.948]  We're good to go.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:17.800]  I think so.
[01:29:35.695 --> 01:29:40.860]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:44.223]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[01:29:44.303 --> 01:29:44.703]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:29:44.743 --> 01:29:45.244]  Call now.
[01:29:53.672 --> 01:29:55.293]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.433 --> 01:29:59.514]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.674 --> 01:30:02.556]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.636 --> 01:30:09.358]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.538 --> 01:30:12.540]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.141]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.261 --> 01:30:23.344]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[01:30:23.444 --> 01:30:25.045]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:54.036 --> 01:30:55.817]  More shampoo, bath soap and dish soap.
[01:30:56.058 --> 01:30:59.901]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:01.042]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.482 --> 01:31:05.605]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache and nausea.
[01:31:05.825 --> 01:31:10.009]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.369 --> 01:31:15.253]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:15.633 --> 01:31:19.237]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:31:19.397 --> 01:31:24.762]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:31:25.022 --> 01:31:27.765]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:31:28.045 --> 01:31:28.946]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:29.267 --> 01:31:39.997]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:00.061]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.741 --> 01:32:03.042]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:14.672]  Well, we've got more calls from Rhode Island, Florida, Canada, all over the place.
[01:32:14.692 --> 01:32:15.872]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:16.052 --> 01:32:21.253]  We've got a little mini-guest coming in here for a second.
[01:32:21.293 --> 01:32:22.613]  I'm honored to have in studio with us.
[01:32:22.713 --> 01:32:29.955]  And then I'm going to get a little bit into Patriot Act II, some of the key subsections, then back to your calls and a bunch of other key news items.
[01:32:30.055 --> 01:32:31.155]  The toll-free number, again, is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:31.175 --> 01:32:32.595]  And I will get to this article.
[01:32:36.505 --> 01:32:41.666]  Placing Mexican flag above Old Glory, Mexican flag flies in Oregon Employment Office.
[01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:51.229]  Very, very interesting, and just gives you an illustration of who's really driving and pushing this whole agenda of destroying our national sovereignty.
[01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:56.351]  But about a week and a half ago, I said, you know, I haven't been up to the GCN radio network.
[01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:57.831]  I've been up here a couple other times before.
[01:32:58.171 --> 01:33:01.372]  Even had a chance to go fishing with Ted Anderson up on the Canadian border.
[01:33:01.872 --> 01:33:02.292]  We're good to go.
[01:33:23.653 --> 01:33:26.536]  In the cockpit of the mothership.
[01:33:26.857 --> 01:33:45.076]  Ted, before we get into some important information, why don't you tell folks your review, your review, as I say in my drawl, of Star Wars 3, because there's been all these parallels with the Empire and the government, that's why we're talking about it, and your review of Revenge of the Sith last night.
[01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:48.271]  Well, honestly, Alex, I was let down a little bit.
[01:33:48.711 --> 01:33:59.158]  I really enjoyed the first Star Wars movie when it came out when I was a kid, and then some of the subsequent ones weren't quite as exciting, but this one here I just didn't think was quite up to snuff.
[01:33:59.198 --> 01:34:01.239]  I think that George Lucas could have done a little better job.
[01:34:02.722 --> 01:34:04.363]  I mean, incredible special effects.
[01:34:04.503 --> 01:34:05.343]  Great plot.
[01:34:05.383 --> 01:34:06.284]  It's the plot I like.
[01:34:06.324 --> 01:34:07.584]  Government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:34:07.624 --> 01:34:09.205]  Secret societies controlling things.
[01:34:09.225 --> 01:34:12.167]  You know, Darth Vader goes in there and sacrifices all these children.
[01:34:12.587 --> 01:34:15.068]  And Lucas says he's modeling this for secret societies.
[01:34:15.348 --> 01:34:16.869]  You know, off the Nazis and others.
[01:34:16.909 --> 01:34:17.809]  That's why it resonates.
[01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:19.730]  But it was like an after-school special.
[01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:21.291]  I mean, I've been in two movies.
[01:34:21.611 --> 01:34:22.792]  Two big movies.
[01:34:23.052 --> 01:34:24.093]  I think the biggest problem was, Ted...
[01:34:52.216 --> 01:34:56.397]  They shot all three of these in two years, about four years ago.
[01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:57.157]  People don't know that.
[01:34:57.657 --> 01:35:00.677]  On blue screens, and then put in all the computer animation around them.
[01:35:00.938 --> 01:35:05.718]  So the people just basically shot three films in a row, I guess one take or something.
[01:35:05.758 --> 01:35:06.999]  It was ridiculous.
[01:35:07.379 --> 01:35:10.819]  Actors I know who are good in other films were no good in this film.
[01:35:11.299 --> 01:35:12.600]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:17.420]  Well, yeah, and there's just a couple parts where I just thought, you know, this doesn't seem very realistic.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:20.761]  You could tell that it was just an act, and I wasn't drawn into it.
[01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:27.988]  And I was kind of hoping to be so, because it was such a work-up and a build-up to the point that movies coming out.
[01:35:28.008 --> 01:35:29.289]  I know that people were dressed up.
[01:35:29.349 --> 01:35:30.631]  It was a big deal up here.
[01:35:31.091 --> 01:35:33.133]  And then I got in there, and it's like, oh, darn it.
[01:35:33.313 --> 01:35:38.218]  Well, anyways, I still enjoyed it, but I got to say, I was kind of hoping for a little more punch.
[01:35:38.639 --> 01:35:43.583]  And again, on the record, the only reason I'm talking about this is because it's such a societal phenomenon.
[01:35:46.028 --> 01:35:46.669]  We're good to go.
[01:35:46.689 --> 01:35:47.349]  We're good to go.
[01:36:07.471 --> 01:36:08.012]  We're good to go.
[01:36:35.027 --> 01:36:35.568]  We're good to go.
[01:36:54.381 --> 01:36:59.023]  I don't know, five years ago from you, and that gold I bought is roughly up about, I don't know, 70%.
[01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:00.384]  It's almost doubled.
[01:37:00.704 --> 01:37:03.645]  I could go sell the gold right now, but I haven't done that.
[01:37:03.665 --> 01:37:06.526]  And while I'm here, I intend to buy a few coins from you.
[01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:08.807]  But, I mean, it's right here in stock, folks.
[01:37:08.827 --> 01:37:12.389]  This is the, you know, in this little collector's case.
[01:37:12.769 --> 01:37:13.509]  This one I grabbed is $18.98.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:21.607]  And it's a United States of America $20, but you've got some that are even older here, Ted.
[01:37:22.368 --> 01:37:24.230]  How much are these and why are these such a good deal?
[01:37:24.570 --> 01:37:31.137]  Well, first of all, usually the $20, these are $20 liberties, and usually when you're buying $20 liberties, you get them and they're loose.
[01:37:31.357 --> 01:37:33.219]  They're not sonically sealed in holders.
[01:37:33.239 --> 01:37:34.481]  These have all been authenticated.
[01:37:35.615 --> 01:37:42.441]  We had a group of coins, 97 of them to be exact is what I'm sitting on inventory, sitting in my safe right here ready to ship for you guys.
[01:37:43.862 --> 01:37:47.906]  What they are is they're $20 liberties and they're the coin that was used back in the 1800s.
[01:37:48.346 --> 01:37:53.872]  As a matter of fact, when Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson and all these guys that were
[01:37:54.512 --> 01:38:06.043]  Well, Andrew Jackson didn't formulate the Constitution, but Thomas Jefferson and the people that were involved with that, they said that the money would be coined in gold and silver.
[01:38:06.844 --> 01:38:09.206]  They first issued a $10 gold piece at that time.
[01:38:09.246 --> 01:38:10.487]  They called it the Eagle Coin.
[01:38:11.428 --> 01:38:14.471]  And back then we didn't really have inflation, Ted.
[01:38:14.531 --> 01:38:17.453]  I mean, I'm sitting here holding, imagine being paid in gold.
[01:38:17.614 --> 01:38:18.855]  Imagine the good old days.
[01:38:19.355 --> 01:38:20.196]  Yep, that's what it is.
[01:38:20.216 --> 01:38:21.657]  I mean, it's a $20 gold piece.
[01:38:21.737 --> 01:38:27.462]  Actually, that was paid, you know, there was like a week's, or in many cases, a month's salary is sitting right here in my hand.
[01:38:27.502 --> 01:38:31.466]  This is a real $20 gold piece, and I just happened to grab one off the stack.
[01:38:31.486 --> 01:38:32.967]  This one is a 1904.
[01:38:33.828 --> 01:38:35.209]  I can grab another one off the stack, 1898.
[01:38:35.389 --> 01:38:37.270]  I mean, could you imagine?
[01:38:37.491 --> 01:38:40.253]  I mean, this could have went to a Civil War veteran.
[01:38:40.553 --> 01:38:45.838]  I mean, we're talking about the people that really, really had something going on in this country.
[01:38:46.398 --> 01:38:51.661]  And back, you know, nowadays you can't, you know, a $20 bill won't buy you a $20 gold piece anymore.
[01:38:51.681 --> 01:39:00.546]  A $20 bill, you can't even have a penny made out of copper because a dollar... Well, I mean, a car 10 years ago that cost $15,000 is like $28,000 now.
[01:39:00.606 --> 01:39:03.868]  And the news tells us there's no inflation when oil prices have doubled.
[01:39:04.208 --> 01:39:08.750]  And now the Bilderberg Group and even the Financial Times of London and others are saying that gold...
[01:39:10.431 --> 01:39:19.620]  Excuse me, not gold, oil could double in price at the wellhead again, and all the experts are saying if that happens, gold is going to skyrocket.
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:26.586]  Well, there's a lot of people that wonder whether their gold is authentic and whether it's a counterfeit or not.
[01:39:27.146 --> 01:39:30.807]  You can take your gold pieces and send them into some of these professional services.
[01:39:30.867 --> 01:39:34.968]  The service that I'm talking about right here is the Numismatic Guarantee Corporation.
[01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:41.169]  And they take those coins and they actually sonically seal them into a holder and they guarantee the authenticity.
[01:39:41.489 --> 01:39:45.790]  Usually when you're picking up $20 liberties, like I said, they're loose and they're not sonically sealed.
[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:51.111]  Usually for this particular piece, you wouldn't put the money into it because of the cost involved in getting that coin.
[01:39:51.551 --> 01:39:52.352]  It's already lost $40.
[01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:19.876]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:19.896 --> 01:40:21.896]  This is just such a great way to get them.
[01:40:22.156 --> 01:40:29.558]  And that substantively increases the value, having them sealed and having them certified by one of the most respected groups out there, Ted.
[01:40:29.738 --> 01:40:33.519]  And also, unlike bullion, these are not trackable by the government, correct?
[01:40:33.559 --> 01:40:34.199]  No, that's right.
[01:40:34.219 --> 01:40:39.221]  As a matter of fact, the Krugerrands, the Maple Leafs, and that type of thing, they fall right into that executive order.
[01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:39.741]  The French.
[01:40:40.482 --> 01:40:42.043]  Yeah, the French coins are another one.
[01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:45.126]  It's the 60-45 ruling is the problem.
[01:40:45.186 --> 01:40:49.009]  You get into that revenue ruling and you have to turn over social security numbers.
[01:40:49.169 --> 01:40:50.831]  That all goes into the tracking database.
[01:40:50.871 --> 01:40:51.251]  These don't.
[01:40:51.471 --> 01:40:52.132]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:52.172 --> 01:40:53.673]  This is a nice private way to have them.
[01:40:53.713 --> 01:40:56.155]  In addition to this, like I said, they're sonically sealed.
[01:40:56.195 --> 01:41:00.039]  And I really, truly recommend if you want to get into gold, this is a great way to get going.
[01:41:00.399 --> 01:41:03.582]  And now is the time to do it because we have a little bit of a back-off in price.
[01:41:04.362 --> 01:41:10.325]  Last time gold hit $3.16, it was at $345 an ounce within just about a matter of a month.
[01:41:10.905 --> 01:41:17.748]  And here we are right now sitting in a situation again where you have this opportunity to pick things up at the prices they are.
[01:41:17.768 --> 01:41:22.270]  I buy when it goes down a little bit, but I don't sell when it goes up.
[01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:24.711]  I just keep a little bit of gold I've got.
[01:41:25.191 --> 01:41:27.012]  Well, I mean, the thing is, Alex, what are you going to do?
[01:41:27.032 --> 01:41:29.233]  Are you going to keep your money sitting in cash?
[01:41:29.573 --> 01:41:30.473]  Is that a very good place?
[01:41:30.533 --> 01:41:38.276]  I mean, we've already seen the purchasing power of our cash drop about 50% when it comes to buying a gallon of gasoline, right?
[01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:51.267]  And the Euro almost four years ago was at 89, 88%, and now it's at $1.30, so that's an over 40%, 41, 42% decrease in the value of the dollar.
[01:41:51.448 --> 01:41:53.809]  And deficit spending here in the United States is going to continue.
[01:41:53.829 --> 01:41:54.370]  That makes me mad.
[01:41:54.390 --> 01:42:01.354]  I mean, I've got two little bank accounts that have got a little bit of money I've been saving for my children's college, and I don't appreciate it being devalued by 40%.
[01:42:02.535 --> 01:42:03.696]  Yeah, I tell you the truth, Alex.
[01:42:03.736 --> 01:42:13.502]  I don't think a person can trust, especially with your children's ages, you just cannot be in cash and expect that that money is going to be worth something 15, 20 years from now for college.
[01:42:14.422 --> 01:42:16.103]  That's an unrealistic expectation.
[01:42:16.143 --> 01:42:25.289]  I know Jack Brownrick up here told the story about how back in the 80s he bought all this gold cheap and they had the crash and it quadrupled in price and he put everybody through college on that.
[01:42:26.016 --> 01:42:26.756]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:42:27.117 --> 01:42:28.257]  And now's the time to be doing it.
[01:42:28.297 --> 01:42:30.198]  We all can see the handwriting on the wall.
[01:42:30.518 --> 01:42:33.700]  But really, truly... Why shouldn't I want some dirty money printed by the Federal Reserve?
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.341]  I mean, I think I'll keep my cash.
[01:42:35.361 --> 01:42:36.441]  I don't think I'll get any gold in.
[01:42:36.761 --> 01:42:42.384]  Well, you know, obviously that's not a very good idea, especially since the fact that people continue to go into debt further.
[01:42:42.404 --> 01:42:43.625]  But I like this old $20 bill.
[01:42:43.645 --> 01:42:46.806]  I got my hand crusty and got a tracker strip in it.
[01:42:46.846 --> 01:42:47.667]  I mean, why should I...
[01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:48.852]  We're good to go.
[01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:49.052]  I think?
[01:43:14.933 --> 01:43:15.873]  686-2237.
[01:43:15.913 --> 01:43:23.981]  And just to ask for the $20 liberties, the sonically sealed $20 liberties and the NGC holders, I have 97 of them.
[01:43:24.001 --> 01:43:25.682]  800-686-2237.
[01:43:25.702 --> 01:43:27.124]  And seriously, folks, I've bought Billion.
[01:43:27.184 --> 01:43:27.964]  I've bought Collectors.
[01:43:28.265 --> 01:43:30.687]  It's good, again, to hedge that as well, to have both.
[01:43:31.467 --> 01:43:49.471]  From the experts I've talked to, I've shopped around and found that as far as prices go with the big gold companies out there, let's say zero being the lowest and 100 being the highest, Ted was in about the 20s or 30s, and he's been here for 10 years, and he's a great guy, and he supports freedom, so I buy from Ted Anderson.
[01:43:49.971 --> 01:43:52.732]  You know, it's like the T-shirts I sell, my anti-New World Order T-shirts.
[01:43:53.092 --> 01:43:55.333]  Some of them, the extra, extra-largest, cost me like $7.50 a piece.
[01:43:56.873 --> 01:43:59.954]  I could get them for three bucks in Mexico, but I don't do that.
[01:44:00.194 --> 01:44:04.236]  They're made in America, and I sell it for the same prices if I bought it in Mexico.
[01:44:04.596 --> 01:44:07.297]  I mean, Big Berkey, made in America.
[01:44:07.397 --> 01:44:14.659]  Some of them are made in England, but you have the choice, the stainless steel or the American Berkey, and we predominantly promote the American Berkey, which we think is even better.
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.901]  I mean, we really try to walk the walk, folks.
[01:44:17.941 --> 01:44:19.141]  We just don't talk the talk.
[01:44:19.501 --> 01:44:21.602]  Give Ted Anderson's great folks a call.
[01:44:22.282 --> 01:44:23.543]  I'm right here in the office with them.
[01:44:23.583 --> 01:44:24.344]  They're great people.
[01:44:24.684 --> 01:44:25.605]  I'm holding the gold.
[01:44:26.546 --> 01:44:29.248]  I'm hitting the microphone with it right now.
[01:44:29.268 --> 01:44:29.308]  800-686-2237.
[01:44:29.328 --> 01:44:29.749]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:44:29.769 --> 01:44:32.531]  And folks, if you ever got to flee the empire, you can carry a lot of money.
[01:44:41.098 --> 01:44:42.998]  We're good to go.
[01:45:03.769 --> 01:45:04.549]  I don't have any of that.
[01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:08.711]  I have a little bit of gold and a little bit of cash in the bank, and that's it.
[01:45:09.312 --> 01:45:11.113]  And land's another good thing to have.
[01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:15.115]  But, again, in the future, it's hard to liquidate that quickly.
[01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.596]  This is liquid, portable, and private, 800-686-2237.
[01:45:17.656 --> 01:45:23.339]  And I appreciate you staying with us during this important financial news.
[01:45:23.659 --> 01:45:27.641]  Ted Anderson, just in 60 seconds, because I appreciate you coming in here with us.
[01:45:27.661 --> 01:45:30.142]  I want to get into the Patriot Act, too, and then into all the calls.
[01:45:30.862 --> 01:45:33.364]  In 60 seconds, tell us about the internet streams.
[01:45:34.205 --> 01:45:35.947]  Most networks don't even offer free streams.
[01:45:36.007 --> 01:45:36.527]  We do.
[01:45:36.948 --> 01:45:44.275]  But to pay for the bandwidth and to do all this, we do have a subscription service for those that want the archives and the higher bitrate quality that listen online.
[01:45:44.475 --> 01:45:45.356]  How do folks do that, Ted?
[01:45:45.776 --> 01:45:46.697]  Well, it's easy.
[01:45:46.717 --> 01:45:48.299]  You go to GCNlive.com.
[01:45:48.339 --> 01:45:49.380]  There are two buttons up there.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.844]  There's one button to be just listening to the archives, and then there's another button to listen to the streaming.
[01:45:54.505 --> 01:45:55.286]  A whole month on MP3.
[01:46:11.187 --> 01:46:14.011]  I mean, you get one entire month on a CD when you get it.
[01:46:14.051 --> 01:46:17.176]  I mean, you can go through an entire month and listen to it.
[01:46:17.216 --> 01:46:18.158]  It's really a great value.
[01:46:18.178 --> 01:46:18.558]  60 hours.
[01:46:18.778 --> 01:46:20.281]  Yep, it's $19.95.
[01:46:20.361 --> 01:46:21.923]  It's just a really great way to get it.
[01:46:21.943 --> 01:46:24.106]  And again, folks, I don't get a red cent for plugging that.
[01:46:24.227 --> 01:46:26.310]  I believe in this network, and I know for a fact.
[01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:33.552]  Ted, in six years, has put his heart, his soul, everything into this network, and we're just starting to crest, just starting.
[01:46:33.572 --> 01:46:36.633]  Every year we double our audience, but it's reaching a geometric level.
[01:46:36.653 --> 01:46:40.534]  We're having such an effect, but we need the capital to fight the New World Order.
[01:46:40.574 --> 01:46:44.336]  Give them that number, Ted.
[01:46:44.596 --> 01:46:46.576]  Well, it's 877-300-7645.
[01:46:46.616 --> 01:46:49.597]  If you want to just call in and order the thing, that's perfectly fine.
[01:46:49.637 --> 01:46:53.979]  Otherwise, you can go to the website, the GCN Live stream, or GCN Live.
[01:46:54.019 --> 01:46:55.039]  Give that number out again, Ted.
[01:46:55.659 --> 01:47:11.086]  Oh, the 800 number is, I'll go a little slower, it's 877-300-7645, and once again, you can get an entire month of any program that's aired here on GCN, and it's all packed together on one CD, and you get to learn.
[01:47:11.106 --> 01:47:11.327]  All right.
[01:47:11.667 --> 01:47:12.767]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:47:12.827 --> 01:47:13.467]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:13.528 --> 01:47:14.488]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:15.008]  You bet.
[01:47:15.068 --> 01:47:18.769]  And again, folks, I don't spend a lot of time on this, but it's really important.
[01:47:18.789 --> 01:47:19.809]  So I call Ted in here.
[01:47:20.169 --> 01:47:28.191]  We do this every few months because, I mean, they really do a great job, and he's an admirable fellow, and the staff up here is really great, and the service is wonderful, and they support freedom.
[01:47:28.211 --> 01:47:30.451]  I mean, who else brings you the guests that we're bringing you?
[01:47:30.712 --> 01:47:32.352]  Who else brings you the stories?
[01:47:32.392 --> 01:47:34.132]  Who else analyzes the propaganda?
[01:47:34.352 --> 01:47:41.634]  Who else gives you a chance to get on air and talk about whatever you want, as long as it's basically not government ops stalking of this program?
[01:47:42.835 --> 01:47:44.096]  We do, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:44.356 --> 01:47:45.137]  Ted, thanks for coming in.
[01:47:45.157 --> 01:47:46.418]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:47:46.839 --> 01:47:47.199]  All right.
[01:47:47.259 --> 01:47:49.201]  Now, I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:47:49.241 --> 01:47:50.001]  I understand that.
[01:47:50.102 --> 01:47:52.304]  We don't have any other guests today.
[01:47:52.384 --> 01:48:00.551]  And we've got an hour and 12 minutes, or an hour and 11 minutes, roughly, to be able to cover all this other news and information.
[01:48:00.591 --> 01:48:04.515]  But I want to tell you where the Patriot Act is right now.
[01:48:05.452 --> 01:48:07.094]  I'm going to try to cut through some of the confusion.
[01:48:07.114 --> 01:48:09.838]  There's Patriot Act I. There's Patriot Act II that have been introduced.
[01:48:09.858 --> 01:48:11.239]  Then there's Victory Act I and II.
[01:48:11.299 --> 01:48:13.763]  They've passed large sections of Patriot Act II.
[01:48:14.123 --> 01:48:16.246]  Of course, Patriot Act I was passed in full in late 2001.
[01:48:18.018 --> 01:48:21.981]  After years of denying Patriot Act II, they're trying to pass it, but they're being very sneaky.
[01:48:22.001 --> 01:48:30.687]  They're calling it reauthorizing Patriot Act I. If you read the subsection provision of Patriot Act I, it is on some little tertiary issues that are window dressing me nothing.
[01:48:31.187 --> 01:48:40.514]  All the key provisions, Section 215, 213, sneak and peek, Section 802 saying all misdemeanor acts are terrorism or any action that endangers human life is a violation of any federal or state law.
[01:48:41.298 --> 01:48:55.548]  All of that stuff is codified in this, and they're going to now try to, in the name of reauthorizing Patriot Act I, because the terrorist threat doesn't expire, you hear Bush say, quote, strengthen it.
[01:48:56.129 --> 01:48:58.991]  And that means radically expand it.
[01:48:59.391 --> 01:49:08.338]  And, you know, they have hearings about wildlife refuges and hearings about the militia and hearings about National Pig Day, National Pork Day.
[01:49:08.358 --> 01:49:10.119]  I mean, all these ridiculous hearings.
[01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:11.675]  We're good to go.
[01:49:29.139 --> 01:49:37.121]  And so I wanted to go over some of the provisions that are in Patriot Act II that have not yet passed, that finally the mainstream media is reporting on, that they're trying to pass.
[01:49:37.461 --> 01:49:46.183]  And to do that, I want to go back to my analysis from 2003 when we first got the bill, and it's the same stinking bill, even worse today, with new stuff added.
[01:49:46.643 --> 01:49:49.624]  It's all coming up on the other side, so keep it locked in.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:57.686]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.866 --> 01:50:02.292]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.432 --> 01:50:06.798]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.858 --> 01:50:08.219]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.981 --> 01:50:14.206]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.266 --> 01:50:21.214]  We rip the Senator-Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.334 --> 01:50:23.357]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:34.200]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.722]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.202 --> 01:50:42.803]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:42.823 --> 01:50:43.423]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:53.290]  Thank you.
[01:51:15.372 --> 01:51:26.421]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.521 --> 01:51:35.409]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:38.971]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:51:50.699 --> 01:51:59.745]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.965 --> 01:52:02.227]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.407 --> 01:52:08.771]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:09.151 --> 01:52:09.531]  Thank you.
[01:52:24.622 --> 01:52:25.002]  We're good to go.
[01:52:57.119 --> 01:52:59.422]  Imagine.
[01:53:00.924 --> 01:53:07.512]  They'll have hearings on the most petty of issues.
[01:53:08.614 --> 01:53:09.535]  But they won't have...
[01:53:10.354 --> 01:53:17.140]  Hearings about the Patriot Act with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cities and multiple states throwing it out, including conservative states.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.622]  Now they're having it in secret for security purposes.
[01:53:19.662 --> 01:53:33.173]  And then when Chris Simcox, the leader of the Minutemen, was invited by Congress to be at a press conference, Homeland Security said, no, he's not allowed into the press conference at the Capitol building for security purposes.
[01:53:33.917 --> 01:53:35.498]  See, they're using it for everything now.
[01:53:35.958 --> 01:53:37.239]  Nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:53:37.719 --> 01:53:39.920]  Secret Patriot Act II destroys remaining U.S.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:40.201]  liberty.
[01:53:40.241 --> 01:53:43.122]  We've reposted this on InfoWars.com.
[01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:47.765]  It's the analysis I won the Project Censored Award for in 2004.
[01:53:48.205 --> 01:53:49.606]  Total police state takeover.
[01:53:49.626 --> 01:53:54.329]  The Secret Patriot Act II destroys what is left of American liberty.
[01:53:55.149 --> 01:54:01.853]  And, again, it is a very long article that I wrote, and then I went section through section...
[01:54:03.661 --> 01:54:07.544]  In here, and look at what I wrote a year and a half ago, almost two years ago.
[01:54:07.584 --> 01:54:10.966]  Look at how it's mirrored by what's happening today.
[01:54:11.974 --> 01:54:24.066]  The secretive tactics being used by the White House and Speaker Hester to keep even the existence of the legislation secret, and see, now they admit it's there, but it's in secret committee, would be more at home in Communist China than the United States.
[01:54:24.407 --> 01:54:35.258]  The fact that Dick Cheney publicly managed the steamroller passage of the First Patriot Act, ensuring that no one was allowed to read it, and publicly threatening members of Congress that if they didn't vote in favor of it, they would be blamed for the next terror attack.
[01:54:35.759 --> 01:54:36.059]  I think?
[01:54:47.179 --> 01:54:55.844]  And then I went on to say the Second Patriot Act about to pass is a mirror image of powers that Julius Caesar and Adolf Hitler gave themselves.
[01:54:56.224 --> 01:55:05.889]  Whereas the First Patriot Act only gutted the First, Third, and Fourth Amendments and seriously damaged the Seventh and Tenth, the Second Patriot Act reorganizes the entire federal government as well as...
[01:55:06.729 --> 01:55:13.954]  Many areas of state government under the dictatorial control of the Justice Department, the Office of Homeland Security, and the FEMA NorthCon Military Command.
[01:55:14.314 --> 01:55:21.318]  The Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, also known as the Second Patriot Act, is by its very structure the definition of a dictatorship.
[01:55:21.798 --> 01:55:23.980]  And we've now seen copies of the new legislation.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:25.801]  It even expands on this.
[01:55:26.822 --> 01:55:32.465]  I challenge all Americans to study the new Patriot Act and to compare it to the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence.
[01:55:33.481 --> 01:55:41.207]  90% of the act has nothing to do with terrorism and is instead a giant federal power grab with tentacles reaching into every facet of our society.
[01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:47.651]  It strips American citizens of all their rights and grants the government its private agent's total immunity.
[01:55:49.293 --> 01:55:55.537]  And here is a quick thumbnail sketch of just some of the draconian measures encapsulated within this tyrannical legislation.
[01:55:56.078 --> 01:55:57.439]  And then we go into the subsections.
[01:55:57.479 --> 01:55:58.179]  Here's just one of them.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.401]  And again, I just went right down through the bill analyzing it.
[01:56:01.541 --> 01:56:01.981]  A U.S.
[01:56:02.001 --> 01:56:08.345]  citizen engaging in lawful activities can be grabbed off the street under Section 501, thrown into a van, never to be seen again.
[01:56:08.625 --> 01:56:13.648]  The Justice Department states that they can do this because the person had interfered and inferred from conduct...
[01:56:14.449 --> 01:56:17.670]  Again, inferred from conduct, not interfered, that they were not a U.S.
[01:56:17.690 --> 01:56:18.050]  citizen.
[01:56:18.090 --> 01:56:24.393]  Remember, 802 of the first Patriot Act states that any violation of federal or state law can result in the enemy combatant terrorist designation.
[01:56:24.773 --> 01:56:34.036]  Section 201 of the second Patriot Act makes it a criminal act for any member of the government or any citizen to release any information concerning the incarceration or whereabouts of detainees.
[01:56:34.336 --> 01:56:35.597]  People couldn't believe us at the time.
[01:56:35.637 --> 01:56:36.597]  Now it's all public news.
[01:56:37.057 --> 01:56:43.440]  It also states that law enforcement does not even have to tell the press who they have arrested, and they never have to release the names.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.502]  Section 301 and 306 are terrorist identification databases.
[01:56:47.842 --> 01:56:58.669]  Set up a national database of suspected terrorists and radically expand the database to include anyone associated with suspected terrorist groups and anyone involved in crimes or having supported any group designated as terrorist.
[01:56:59.029 --> 01:57:07.954]  These sections also set up a national DNA database for anyone on probation or who has been on probation for any crime and orders state governments to collect the DNA for the federal government.
[01:57:08.334 --> 01:57:08.654]  Section 312...
[01:57:10.393 --> 01:57:20.161]  It gives immunity to law enforcement engaging in spying operations against the American people and would place substantial restrictions on court injunctions against federal violations of civil rights across the board.
[01:57:20.861 --> 01:57:22.163]  You're now hearing about that in the news.
[01:57:22.383 --> 01:57:28.768]  Section 101 would designate individual terrorists as foreign powers and again strip them of all rights under the enemy combatant designation.
[01:57:29.915 --> 01:57:32.438]  We will start the third hour.
[01:57:32.698 --> 01:57:41.386]  I will go through the five callers that are loaded up our little phone lines, and then we will plunge back into the analysis of this draconian legislation.
[01:57:43.688 --> 01:57:45.710]  Big Brother
[01:57:51.477 --> 01:57:55.380]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.121 --> 01:57:57.001]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.021 --> 01:58:01.485]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.886 --> 01:58:05.969]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.123 --> 01:58:10.404]  All right, my friends.
[01:58:10.424 --> 01:58:18.109]  They have introduced Patriot Act 2, the sections they were unable to pass in the last few years, piecemeal, along with a bunch of other draconian legislation.
[01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:22.512]  It's now in a secret committee hearing throughout the next week, a group of hearings.
[01:58:22.772 --> 01:58:25.394]  The public isn't allowed to be involved or know any of the details.
[01:58:26.014 --> 01:58:27.414]  For, quote, security purposes.
[01:58:27.754 --> 01:58:32.396]  And after we take some calls, I want to go back over some of the subsections in the original Patriot Act II.
[01:58:32.456 --> 01:58:37.457]  And finally, the press is reporting on the secret arrest, on not having warrants anymore, period.
[01:58:38.077 --> 01:58:40.258]  I mean, it's just getting crazier and crazier.
[01:58:40.598 --> 01:58:43.058]  I'll also get into Medford, Oregon.
[01:58:43.098 --> 01:58:45.759]  The Mexican flag flying above the American flag at government buildings.
[01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:47.940]  Isn't that all part of freedom?
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.700]  And so much more.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.281]  We've now learned more details of the mega-earthquake back in December.
[01:58:53.957 --> 01:58:59.440]  And just exactly what it did to the earth and the tectonic plates, you might be surprised by what you're going to hear.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.821]  New information there.
[01:59:00.841 --> 01:59:02.662]  You've been holding for a while.
[01:59:02.722 --> 01:59:03.922]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:59:04.042 --> 01:59:05.043]  Dale in Florida.
[01:59:05.063 --> 01:59:05.803]  Dale, go ahead.
[01:59:07.864 --> 01:59:08.144]  Hello?
[01:59:08.324 --> 01:59:08.645]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:08.865 --> 01:59:10.165]  Oh, this is Bill in Florida.
[01:59:10.245 --> 01:59:11.106]  Okay, well, go ahead, Bill.
[01:59:11.126 --> 01:59:11.346]  Okay.
[01:59:11.466 --> 01:59:11.926]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:12.006 --> 01:59:13.347]  Great talking to you, fella.
[01:59:13.767 --> 01:59:17.029]  Look, I've got our Constitution in my hand.
[01:59:17.849 --> 01:59:21.391]  And how about Article 1, Section 8?
[01:59:22.092 --> 01:59:22.812]  The Congress...
[01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:25.217]  And that's Article 1, Section 8?
[01:59:25.317 --> 01:59:27.779]  Yeah, Article 1, Section 8, our Constitution, yours and mine.
[01:59:48.067 --> 01:59:49.188]  And the other people that are married.
[01:59:49.208 --> 01:59:53.330]  We need to write an article and point that out, but Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[01:59:53.610 --> 01:59:58.292]  I know, but still, it says Congress shall provide for recalling fourth militia.
[01:59:58.792 --> 02:00:04.075]  No, the executive branch is supposed to execute what the Congress does, not supposed to run the thing.
[02:00:04.415 --> 02:00:06.436]  So this is ammunition for impeachment.
[02:00:06.897 --> 02:00:13.640]  All these congressmen that put up their hands, swore in the Bible to uphold the Constitution, yours and mine's,
[02:00:14.551 --> 02:00:15.952]  And they're not doing it.
[02:00:16.333 --> 02:00:17.594]  This is grounds for impeachment.
[02:00:17.614 --> 02:00:19.075]  No, you're right, Bill.
[02:00:19.135 --> 02:00:20.356]  This is our country.
[02:00:21.437 --> 02:00:22.878]  This is a nation of laws.
[02:00:22.938 --> 02:00:25.900]  The government isn't all powerful and isn't God.
[02:00:26.321 --> 02:00:27.462]  And they shouldn't be doing this.
[02:00:27.502 --> 02:00:28.823]  They shouldn't be getting away with this.
[02:00:29.023 --> 02:00:30.204]  Yeah, but they should be impeached.
[02:00:31.068 --> 02:00:32.248]  Listen, I totally agree with you.
[02:00:32.268 --> 02:00:36.610]  Bill Clinton should have been impeached, and the least of which for some intern.
[02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:48.314]  I mean, that was bad enough, but for the Chinese generals and the spies and all of it, that Bush has been protecting Bill Clinton since then, and now the stuff Bush has done dwarfs what Bill Clinton did because we're just further along in the New World Order.
[02:00:48.574 --> 02:00:51.935]  Yeah, but don't you agree with me that we're being invaded?
[02:00:52.615 --> 02:00:55.696]  Oh, openly, openly it's being said as part of the federal plan.
[02:00:55.716 --> 02:00:56.276]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:56.596 --> 02:00:57.156]  Great points.
[02:00:57.236 --> 02:00:58.737]  Bob in Rhode Island, holding patiently.
[02:00:58.777 --> 02:00:59.317]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:01:00.396 --> 02:01:01.217]  Hey, Alex, what's up?
[02:01:01.918 --> 02:01:03.139]  We're doing a radio program, sir.
[02:01:03.179 --> 02:01:03.779]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:03.799 --> 02:01:09.445]  Hey, on your main page, right, where it says, listen, 1320 a.m.
[02:01:09.485 --> 02:01:13.348]  in Rhode Island, they became a sports show now, so you're no longer on there.
[02:01:13.689 --> 02:01:16.091]  Yeah, I thought we took that affiliate off there.
[02:01:16.111 --> 02:01:17.372]  Is that still on there?
[02:01:17.432 --> 02:01:17.993]  It got sold.
[02:01:18.013 --> 02:01:21.296]  No, no, I'm asking you, is it still on my website?
[02:01:21.316 --> 02:01:22.057]  That needs to be taken down.
[02:01:26.079 --> 02:01:27.901]  I want to talk to you about... I mean, that happens.
[02:01:27.921 --> 02:01:28.721]  Stations sell.
[02:01:28.741 --> 02:01:30.443]  They change formats.
[02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:31.243]  We gain new stations.
[02:01:31.263 --> 02:01:32.084]  We lose new stations.
[02:01:32.164 --> 02:01:33.765]  It's kind of an equilibrium thing.
[02:01:33.785 --> 02:01:36.668]  I'm listening to you on the internet, though, which is real cool.
[02:01:36.748 --> 02:01:37.468]  Well, welcome, sir.
[02:01:37.828 --> 02:01:38.709]  In Rhode Island, right?
[02:01:38.729 --> 02:01:45.014]  These three officers, they stole guns from guns that were going to be destroyed, right?
[02:01:45.434 --> 02:01:47.816]  That were gathered up in investigations.
[02:01:47.936 --> 02:01:49.598]  I see one of those stories every month, yeah.
[02:01:50.018 --> 02:01:50.859]  They steal the drugs.
[02:01:50.879 --> 02:01:51.619]  They steal the guns.
[02:01:51.639 --> 02:01:52.320]  They sell them again.
[02:01:52.907 --> 02:01:55.028]  I didn't see that particular article, but I'm familiar.
[02:01:55.048 --> 02:02:00.231]  I mean, look, cops go and shoot up a whole neighborhood and shoot their own cops and shoot innocent people and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:02:00.251 --> 02:02:01.551]  I mean, it's just general craziness, Bob.
[02:02:01.611 --> 02:02:02.272]  Anything else?
[02:02:19.622 --> 02:02:20.342]  When you had J.D.
[02:02:20.382 --> 02:02:23.604]  Hayworth on, how did you feel about what you're saying on the radio?
[02:02:24.444 --> 02:02:27.905]  Well, he agreed that Bush is trying to get the borders wide open.
[02:02:28.665 --> 02:02:31.226]  And everything else about 9-11 and everything.
[02:02:31.487 --> 02:02:32.407]  I need to get him back on.
[02:02:32.427 --> 02:02:33.467]  He said he'd come on for longer.
[02:02:33.507 --> 02:02:35.208]  I didn't have a chance to ask him about that.
[02:02:35.468 --> 02:02:36.068]  Bob, thanks.
[02:02:36.088 --> 02:02:37.369]  We're going to move quick now.
[02:02:37.749 --> 02:02:40.330]  Nick, Steve, Eric, and others, 1-800-259-9231. presentplanet.tv is the website.
[02:02:46.019 --> 02:02:53.428]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.688 --> 02:02:58.433]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.653 --> 02:03:04.300]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:05.260]  We're good to go.
[02:03:29.725 --> 02:03:30.006]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:44.873 --> 02:03:48.354]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.614 --> 02:03:52.115]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.215 --> 02:03:56.156]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.377 --> 02:04:02.538]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.939 --> 02:04:10.861]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.281 --> 02:04:12.002]  We're good to go.
[02:04:26.635 --> 02:04:30.456]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:36.498]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:36.538 --> 02:04:37.858]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:43.624 --> 02:04:51.587]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:04:51.987 --> 02:04:53.248]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:04:53.428 --> 02:04:54.128]  Now, check this out.
[02:04:54.488 --> 02:04:57.930]  The average American consumes two to three pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:04:58.230 --> 02:04:59.310]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[02:05:00.891 --> 02:05:03.555]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[02:05:03.795 --> 02:05:04.616]  Your health suffers.
[02:05:04.836 --> 02:05:05.477]  It's that simple.
[02:05:05.797 --> 02:05:09.762]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[02:05:10.223 --> 02:05:18.133]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[02:05:18.593 --> 02:05:22.695]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:24.376]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[02:05:24.396 --> 02:05:26.457]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:05:26.477 --> 02:05:28.158]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:05:28.178 --> 02:05:29.219]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:52.483]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.083 --> 02:05:56.125]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.585 --> 02:05:58.626]  You know what I feel like?
[02:05:58.986 --> 02:06:05.329]  I feel like a firefighter who is trying to fight about 500 fires at once.
[02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:06.590]  I mean, that's what it feels like.
[02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:09.471]  Any of these issues, we could spend all day on them.
[02:06:10.259 --> 02:06:11.621]  We've got to talk about it.
[02:06:11.641 --> 02:06:14.205]  We've got to defend this country because we've defeated a lot of stuff.
[02:06:22.037 --> 02:06:25.220]  I mean, if you weren't out there doing what you do, things would be much worse.
[02:06:25.901 --> 02:06:32.768]  Unfortunately, most Americans who are politically involved are either liberals or conservatives, and they don't even know that that is a completely false system.
[02:06:33.329 --> 02:06:35.851]  There is no difference in the Republicans and Democrats at the top.
[02:06:35.871 --> 02:06:43.379]  They actually have fake little fights to make you think that you have some type of choice within that controlled system.
[02:06:44.771 --> 02:06:47.653]  Now, I'm just going to explode through your calls.
[02:06:47.673 --> 02:07:00.242]  I'm giving each person about 60 seconds, because I want to then get back into Patriot Act II that they're trying to pass, and some other news, and then I want to get into the structure and operations of the New World War in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[02:07:00.642 --> 02:07:01.463]  Nick in Canada.
[02:07:01.483 --> 02:07:02.063]  Nick, go ahead.
[02:07:02.103 --> 02:07:02.644]  Thanks for holding.
[02:07:03.197 --> 02:07:04.818]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:07:05.378 --> 02:07:08.699]  I just want to read you a quote right off the bat from Margaret Mead.
[02:07:08.839 --> 02:07:13.060]  It says, Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.381]  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
[02:07:15.921 --> 02:07:25.944]  And I think that pretty much sums up exactly what you're doing, and I want to thank you for having your internet sites and your radio broadcasts, because you're opening the eyes of a lot of people all around the world, myself included.
[02:07:27.181 --> 02:07:41.264]  But one topic I want to discuss with you is something that I've heard you talk about briefly before and something that came to my attention thanks to Renz, who I've heard was on your site the other day, and I listened to that quite carefully, and that's the topic of chemtrails.
[02:07:42.545 --> 02:07:49.486]  I've seen both of your films, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and your latest film, and I think they were both genius.
[02:07:49.746 --> 02:07:52.547]  I've made several copies and passed them on to as many people as I can,
[02:07:53.115 --> 02:07:58.619]  And I want to urge you and encourage you strongly to please do something and make a film on the topic of chemtrails.
[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:00.981]  Well, I know it would be a bestseller.
[02:08:01.221 --> 02:08:04.263]  It's just that other films have been made that have done a good job exposing it.
[02:08:04.704 --> 02:08:07.366]  There's also a lot of disinformation out there on the subject.
[02:08:07.426 --> 02:08:09.827]  I mean, let me just say this for people who don't know what you're talking about.
[02:08:10.448 --> 02:08:11.989]  Everybody, watch old movies.
[02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:15.732]  I mean, from the 60s, 70s, 80s, early 90s, mid-90s.
[02:08:16.653 --> 02:08:19.815]  Watch TV shows from the 90s and 80s and 70s.
[02:08:20.215 --> 02:08:22.457]  You never saw jet trails in the sky.
[02:08:23.249 --> 02:08:32.514]  I mean, growing up, up until about six, seven years ago, a jet would fly over, it would leave a trail, it would dissipate in seconds to a maximum of two minutes.
[02:08:33.294 --> 02:08:45.640]  Now, starting in the late 90s, in Austin, Texas, and all over the country I've seen it, I've traveled all over the nation, you know, many different states, I mean, I see condensation trails forming at three or four thousand feet where I never saw them before.
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:47.801]  They sit there for two, three, four hours.
[02:08:47.861 --> 02:08:52.784]  I've been, you know, at my house doing yard work, cleaning out the garage before, and seen a trail sit there for five hours.
[02:08:53.004 --> 02:08:54.725]  I want to know why magically everything changed in the late 1990s.
[02:09:23.564 --> 02:09:38.907]  And clearly from a lot of scientists and experts and the government documents we have from HAARP and, well, it was in ABC News that the Russians for the V-J Day or whatever, you know, the Russian day that they defeated the Nazis where Bush went over there.
[02:09:39.227 --> 02:09:40.848]  They were going to share good weather for that.
[02:09:41.088 --> 02:09:47.169]  Yeah, there were storms all around the city and they had been raining all week and they flew in with jet fighters and sprayed chemicals and stopped it.
[02:09:48.002 --> 02:09:53.746]  And so, I mean, I've got a Weather Channel piece that listeners sent me, and then later I actually saw it on TV.
[02:09:54.287 --> 02:09:56.048]  One of the few times I was watching TV, I caught it.
[02:09:56.208 --> 02:09:58.550]  A show called Atmospheres did a thing called Weather Wars.
[02:09:58.930 --> 02:10:01.251]  It admitted they were controlling the weather over Vietnam.
[02:10:01.612 --> 02:10:03.813]  They could totally control it in the late 60s.
[02:10:04.414 --> 02:10:06.875]  And then they have these antenna farms.
[02:10:07.556 --> 02:10:09.037]  They spray chemicals and then...
[02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:10.371]  We're good to go.
[02:10:26.248 --> 02:10:33.230]  We know that Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 said there are weather weapons, there are earthquakes, seismic weapons.
[02:10:33.590 --> 02:10:36.491]  We've got 1950s documents for tsunami bombs.
[02:10:36.531 --> 02:10:38.092]  I mean, that's BBC.
[02:10:38.592 --> 02:10:40.012]  So this stuff is real.
[02:10:40.093 --> 02:10:41.413]  I've got a bill published.
[02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:42.494]  We're good to go.
[02:10:42.514 --> 02:10:42.974]  We're good to go.
[02:11:06.232 --> 02:11:06.672]  Steve in Kansas.
[02:11:06.732 --> 02:11:07.313]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:11:07.333 --> 02:11:08.174]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:08.414]  Good, sir.
[02:11:08.454 --> 02:11:09.154]  Good to talk to you.
[02:11:09.174 --> 02:11:10.215]  There was a bizarre bank robbery here in Olathe.
[02:11:10.295 --> 02:11:13.958]  And, you know, being that I've watched six of your ten movies and handed a bunch of them out,
[02:11:37.361 --> 02:11:57.293]  You see the SWAT team, the police officers in ski masks, and then the actual hostages of that bank robbery, they were handcuffed by the police and led into a restaurant for the police protection.
[02:11:57.573 --> 02:11:58.594]  These guys got guns!
[02:12:01.316 --> 02:12:03.097]  Now say that again, who was led into the restaurant?
[02:12:03.652 --> 02:12:19.110]  The police officers escorted the bank people into this restaurant, handcuffed, because they didn't want anybody, you know, any of the said perpetrators
[02:12:24.285 --> 02:12:27.368]  Well, this is something that's done.
[02:12:27.428 --> 02:12:31.672]  I've seen it in cases where the person's already fled ten minutes earlier and they handcuff everybody.
[02:12:32.333 --> 02:12:35.155]  And now there's a school threat or something.
[02:12:35.776 --> 02:12:42.402]  Bigger and bigger areas in the neighborhood, larger and larger areas, they shut them down, they search every house, they handcuff everybody.
[02:12:42.702 --> 02:12:43.303]  Well, I mean, it's like...
[02:12:44.568 --> 02:12:49.892]  That case up there in Goose Creek, North Carolina, where they made 200 of the kids in middle school line up.
[02:12:49.932 --> 02:12:51.453]  The dogs would grab their bags.
[02:12:51.533 --> 02:12:54.135]  I saw that on your film.
[02:12:54.295 --> 02:12:55.796]  And rip them open.
[02:12:55.816 --> 02:12:57.137]  The people would start crying.
[02:12:57.517 --> 02:12:59.118]  And no drugs were found.
[02:12:59.158 --> 02:13:00.599]  It was just, oh, a routine sweep.
[02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:04.422]  We put guns to your head and put everybody in handcuffs and have dogs bite your bags.
[02:13:04.982 --> 02:13:06.263]  I mean, this is Nazi Germany.
[02:13:06.363 --> 02:13:08.564]  Oh, we've got to stop the drugs that they're shipping in.
[02:13:08.584 --> 02:13:10.306]  It's just bizarre to me.
[02:13:10.426 --> 02:13:13.708]  Why do you handcuff somebody when you're the one that's holding...
[02:13:14.284 --> 02:13:22.733]  You know, automatic weapons, you have, you know, ten police officers around them, and you still have the handcuffs.
[02:13:23.254 --> 02:13:28.239]  Don't you think that John Doe is going to say, that guy doesn't belong here?
[02:13:28.815 --> 02:13:30.916]  Well, they never did it in the past, and I appreciate the call.
[02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:38.280]  But, again, the citizens are evil terrorists, and the nice men in black masks and black Nazi curtsy helmets that look quite like Darth Vader will keep you safe.
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:40.120]  Eric in California.
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:40.841]  Eric, go ahead.
[02:13:40.861 --> 02:13:42.542]  Hey, I'm going to change the subject really quick.
[02:13:42.562 --> 02:13:44.002]  Hey, back to the police state.
[02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:47.144]  I know you had a police state, too, the takeover and stuff like that.
[02:13:47.404 --> 02:13:53.327]  I think in one of them you talked about the desensitization of our youth to the military, and I've just come to realize that back in the 1990s,
[02:13:54.403 --> 02:13:55.864]  Yeah, guns are evil for your parents.
[02:13:55.884 --> 02:13:58.825]  In fact, it's been on the news where a, you know...
[02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:17.791]  In one case, a four-year-old.
[02:14:17.811 --> 02:14:20.292]  In other cases, ten-year-olds are out shooting guns in the backyard.
[02:14:20.692 --> 02:14:22.553]  The neighbors panic and call the police.
[02:14:22.873 --> 02:14:27.455]  But then the military comes into schools, does demonstrations, does all of this.
[02:14:27.575 --> 02:14:29.336]  It's good when they have guns.
[02:14:29.456 --> 02:14:30.396]  I'm not against the military.
[02:14:31.256 --> 02:14:35.118]  It's just amazing to me because I remember at the time, in fact, I'm watching a thing on the military channel about the military.
[02:14:35.458 --> 02:14:41.181]  I'm just psychologically... Yeah, they have the new military channel that's on commercial TV to propagandize this.
[02:14:41.221 --> 02:14:43.122]  Maybe all the channels will be government-san.
[02:14:43.282 --> 02:14:46.103]  Yeah, I just remember... I just want to make a point about how
[02:14:46.523 --> 02:14:48.685]  I mean, don't think it's just some kooky, paranoid thing.
[02:14:48.745 --> 02:14:49.305]  It's so true.
[02:14:49.425 --> 02:14:54.369]  Well, no, they admit they're recruiting in the schools and threatening to arrest people that don't show up at the recruitment office.
[02:14:54.429 --> 02:14:55.230]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.750]  Great points.
[02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:58.172]  Was that Goose?
[02:14:58.713 --> 02:15:00.194]  A lot of interesting names today.
[02:15:00.254 --> 02:15:01.295]  A lot of interesting callers.
[02:15:02.075 --> 02:15:03.377]  Goose in Ohio.
[02:15:03.917 --> 02:15:05.618]  Must be related to Skunk, who called earlier.
[02:15:05.939 --> 02:15:06.919]  Hey, Goose, how you doing?
[02:15:06.979 --> 02:15:07.760]  How you doing, brother?
[02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:11.483]  Out here trying to wake up people in Ohio.
[02:15:11.963 --> 02:15:12.304]  I just...
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:18.283]  I have to say that you do Randy Savage better than Randy Savage does Randy Savage.
[02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:20.064]  Who is Randy Savage?
[02:15:20.084 --> 02:15:20.884]  The wrestler.
[02:15:22.145 --> 02:15:23.706]  Oh, Macho Man Randy Savage.
[02:15:23.726 --> 02:15:24.626]  Macho Man, yeah.
[02:15:24.666 --> 02:15:25.787]  Step into a Slim Jim.
[02:15:25.827 --> 02:15:27.288]  Ooh, baby, you're going to get it.
[02:15:27.348 --> 02:15:27.848]  Yeah.
[02:15:28.168 --> 02:15:29.349]  You're going down.
[02:15:29.369 --> 02:15:31.310]  I get a kick out of you.
[02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:33.872]  I'm going to defeat Hulk Hogan today.
[02:15:34.752 --> 02:15:37.534]  Wrestling's real, and I'll kick your tail if you say it isn't.
[02:15:37.774 --> 02:15:38.234]  Oh, yeah.
[02:15:39.791 --> 02:15:44.815]  And the point is, wrestling isn't real, but millions of adults think it is, just like they think the elections are real.
[02:15:45.015 --> 02:15:45.676]  Exactly.
[02:15:46.236 --> 02:15:59.887]  Well, one thing I did want to mention, and I don't know if you know this or not, our Constitution is like... The Constitution's going down to keep this republic safe from terrorists.
[02:16:00.348 --> 02:16:02.650]  It only governs the U.S.
[02:16:02.730 --> 02:16:04.711]  territories and the outlying areas.
[02:16:04.872 --> 02:16:05.252]  Actually...
[02:16:05.839 --> 02:16:10.667]  People in their personal state... Yeah, the states in the past made their own laws.
[02:16:11.048 --> 02:16:15.816]  Yeah, you're governed under the state constitution and not the original constitution.
[02:16:15.876 --> 02:16:17.158]  People need to understand that.
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:21.683]  Now we're disbanding the Senate and the regional governors will be in control.
[02:16:21.783 --> 02:16:22.383]  Exactly.
[02:16:22.423 --> 02:16:23.164]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:23.344 --> 02:16:28.727]  I've got a whole, you know what here, I've got to go fast because I've got a bunch of news to cover in a short time to get there.
[02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:29.908]  Good points, Goose.
[02:16:31.569 --> 02:16:33.710]  Linda in Kansas City, Missouri.
[02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:34.210]  Thank you.
[02:16:34.611 --> 02:16:38.473]  I'm reading from the Kansas Star Tuesday, May 17.
[02:16:39.814 --> 02:16:43.276]  We have an arsonist in Kansas City who's going to trial.
[02:16:44.157 --> 02:16:46.458]  His name is David Ryan Jay.
[02:16:47.452 --> 02:16:51.414]  And he set 14 fires through Johnson County on the Kansas side.
[02:16:52.915 --> 02:17:04.482]  And defense attorney Deb Snyder described Jay, 24, of Olathe, Kansas, as a very sick young man suffered from paranoid delusions of enslavement by the New World Order.
[02:17:05.803 --> 02:17:06.544]  You're joking.
[02:17:06.844 --> 02:17:11.927]  No, this is in the... And I bet money that he was on Prozac or something.
[02:17:12.807 --> 02:17:16.990]  Well, Jay has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defects.
[02:17:18.275 --> 02:17:18.655]  Stay there.
[02:17:18.695 --> 02:17:19.856]  You've got to email this to me.
[02:17:20.576 --> 02:17:21.796]  You've got to email this to me.
[02:17:22.557 --> 02:17:23.457]  This is amazing.
[02:17:24.897 --> 02:17:25.738]  I've got to hear this.
[02:17:25.978 --> 02:17:27.658]  So stay there, Linda.
[02:17:27.758 --> 02:17:28.819]  And then we'll talk to Tim.
[02:17:28.839 --> 02:17:35.861]  And that's going to be it for calls because I've got to get back into the Patriot Act 2 that they're trying to pass secretly right now again and what's really in it.
[02:17:35.901 --> 02:17:39.002]  And then I want to get into the structure of the New World Order.
[02:17:39.022 --> 02:17:39.883]  A lot of stuff to cover.
[02:17:40.243 --> 02:17:41.483]  A short time to get there.
[02:17:41.903 --> 02:17:42.924]  But we'll cover it all.
[02:17:43.024 --> 02:17:43.704]  Keep it locked in.
[02:17:45.365 --> 02:17:49.968]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[02:17:50.208 --> 02:17:58.654]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[02:17:58.834 --> 02:18:00.875]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, M.D.
[02:18:01.195 --> 02:18:06.379]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[02:18:06.579 --> 02:18:12.885]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.

[02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:19.271]  Here's Cheryl G. in California.
[02:18:19.492 --> 02:18:25.958]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do without an exercise in two to three years.
[02:18:26.258 --> 02:18:32.820]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid quail is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at quaildirect.com.
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:36.561]  Quail your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[02:18:37.042 --> 02:18:39.882]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:18:40.002 --> 02:18:43.203]  Quail is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:18:43.424 --> 02:18:44.604]  Individual results may vary.
[02:18:45.464 --> 02:18:46.085]  Hello, folks.
[02:18:46.185 --> 02:18:47.085]  Alex Jones here.
[02:18:47.225 --> 02:18:51.289]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:54.351]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:54.431 --> 02:19:01.137]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract water-borne contaminants.
[02:19:01.317 --> 02:19:04.339]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:19:04.539 --> 02:19:06.921]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:07.041 --> 02:19:15.128]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as azithromycin,
[02:19:15.228 --> 02:19:16.828]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:19:46.585 --> 02:19:48.906]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:19:49.226 --> 02:19:50.226]  The real money folks.
[02:19:53.548 --> 02:19:55.468]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:19:55.968 --> 02:19:56.829]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:56.869 --> 02:19:57.469]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:19:57.509 --> 02:19:57.889]  A 5% increase.
[02:19:57.929 --> 02:19:59.730]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:01.330]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:20:14.684 --> 02:20:15.344]  We're good to go.
[02:20:45.201 --> 02:20:49.283]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.
[02:20:49.583 --> 02:20:57.387]  rxdrugcard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.
[02:20:57.567 --> 02:21:07.451]  As a member of rxdrugcard.com, you'll enjoy savings of up to 80% on all prescription medications at over 52,000 USA pharmacies, including Walmart, Walgreens, and Eckerd's.
[02:21:07.551 --> 02:21:07.991]  We're good to go.
[02:21:28.131 --> 02:21:29.092]  Or call 888-216-2461.
[02:21:29.472 --> 02:21:29.672]  That's 888-216-2461.
[02:21:51.826 --> 02:21:59.529]  Waging war on corruption, crashing into the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:21:59.549 --> 02:22:03.250]  We talk about real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:05.731]  That's why we call it Real Talk Radio.
[02:22:06.151 --> 02:22:08.072]  We've only got about 35 minutes left.
[02:22:08.132 --> 02:22:15.915]  We'll take two more calls in this short segment, come back in the long segment and speed through how they're trying to expand the Patriot Act, how they have it in the Secret Senate Committee.
[02:22:16.355 --> 02:22:17.215]  Very, very serious.
[02:22:17.235 --> 02:22:19.296]  Go over some of what's in this legislation.
[02:22:19.796 --> 02:22:20.537]  We're good to go.
[02:22:39.972 --> 02:22:42.114]  Had delusions of the New World Order.
[02:22:42.975 --> 02:22:53.446]  I wonder if the prosecutors told him to say that, or he could be somebody who has mental problems, and it's not our fault that he hears President Bush's father call for a New World Order, or Gary Hart.
[02:22:54.526 --> 02:23:00.390]  On C-Spanish, not our fault, that he may have seen CNN where they said, yeah, the Bilderberg Group wants a one world government.
[02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:02.832]  You know, we have that video on Infowars.com.
[02:23:02.872 --> 02:23:10.758]  So, I mean, the New World Order is a real thing, but I guess we're still evil if we talk about it and it causes you to spontaneously commit these horrible attacks.
[02:23:10.938 --> 02:23:13.960]  Linda, give us the actual text of that article and the headline.
[02:23:14.401 --> 02:23:17.843]  The headline is from May 17th, not today, May 1705.
[02:23:17.923 --> 02:23:20.645]  So a few days ago.
[02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:24.502]  B section.
[02:23:24.842 --> 02:23:26.183]  Metropolitan section.
[02:23:27.304 --> 02:23:30.426]  It's www.kansascstar.com.
[02:23:31.507 --> 02:23:35.970]  Top of the page it says defense alleged arsonist very sick.
[02:23:37.731 --> 02:23:40.873]  And the fires were set between March 7th and March 11th.
[02:23:41.253 --> 02:23:46.797]  He's already going to trial pleading guilty for his mental disease or defect.
[02:23:48.399 --> 02:23:52.521]  Well, it's just a terrible thing that has happened.
[02:23:52.561 --> 02:24:00.005]  And if he's pleading guilty, but I guess he's saying he's innocent for reasons of insanity.
[02:24:00.025 --> 02:24:01.765]  I mean, that does sound insane.
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:08.644]  There have been people who go out and commit attempted assassinations because they love an actress.
[02:24:09.044 --> 02:24:10.726]  Does that mean it's the actress's fault?
[02:24:11.426 --> 02:24:12.127]  No, it doesn't.
[02:24:12.607 --> 02:24:20.074]  But I'm very suspicious about the claims of that newspaper because I've seen that newspaper really attack those that are concerned about global government in the past.
[02:24:21.014 --> 02:24:30.561]  Reuters yesterday came out and said that the CFR came out with the Canadian, U.S., and Mexican government and wants to get rid of the borders and merge our military and police.
[02:24:30.901 --> 02:24:31.901]  So that was Reuters.
[02:24:31.981 --> 02:24:35.704]  So I guess Reuters is engaging in bizarre conspiracy theories.
[02:24:36.765 --> 02:24:41.648]  Well, the star also says that one of the properties was worth $7 to $8 million.
[02:24:41.968 --> 02:24:46.011]  So 14 fires, some of those fires had been put out, weren't set well enough.
[02:24:46.031 --> 02:24:47.752]  Do they say why he claimed he did this?
[02:24:48.729 --> 02:24:59.481]  Well, that's exactly the defense attorney, Deb Snyder, described, Jay, a very young, sick young man suffering from paranoid delusions of enslavement by the New World Order.
[02:25:00.558 --> 02:25:02.779]  Well, that is a problem that we found.
[02:25:03.019 --> 02:25:09.422]  Programs like this do attract schizophrenics and other people because they're already unstable.
[02:25:09.462 --> 02:25:15.385]  And then they hear us play clips off CNN where they say world government, Bilderberg Group is real, they want world government.
[02:25:15.405 --> 02:25:18.046]  They hear us play clips where presidents call for a new world order.
[02:25:18.066 --> 02:25:22.448]  They hear us read articles where they say we're going to have a cashless society.
[02:25:22.488 --> 02:25:29.151]  They hear us go over all this and it does cause them to have some extra stress.
[02:25:29.671 --> 02:25:31.593]  But so will a plane flying over them.
[02:25:32.333 --> 02:25:36.957]  So will, you know, basically somebody honking a horn outside their window at night.
[02:25:37.197 --> 02:25:38.138]  Ooh, it's a conspiracy.
[02:25:38.158 --> 02:25:38.919]  They're out to get us.
[02:25:38.939 --> 02:25:41.101]  I mean, there are paranoid delusionals out there.
[02:25:41.121 --> 02:25:42.722]  But this guy may be completely innocent.
[02:25:42.922 --> 02:25:44.223]  This may be totally made up.
[02:25:44.523 --> 02:25:45.124]  We don't know.
[02:25:45.184 --> 02:25:53.751]  We've seen so many pieces of propaganda, so many frame-ups, so many crime labs lying, so many police lying, that you never know what to trust anymore.
[02:25:53.791 --> 02:25:55.052]  That's the problem with tyranny.
[02:25:55.272 --> 02:25:58.155]  He may be completely innocent, or he may be a delusional...
[02:25:58.835 --> 02:25:59.936]  Paranoid Schizophrenic.
[02:25:59.976 --> 02:26:03.178]  But we should all pray for this young man and pray that the truth comes out.
[02:26:03.439 --> 02:26:04.179]  Anything else, Linda?
[02:26:04.639 --> 02:26:09.743]  Well, the article is written by Tony Rizzo, R-I-Z-Z-O, Nancy Starr.
[02:26:10.544 --> 02:26:11.324]  All right, thank you.
[02:26:11.625 --> 02:26:16.608]  Somebody find that clip or I'll try to go find that clipping, and we'll try to get it posted with some comments.
[02:26:16.969 --> 02:26:19.631]  Last caller I have time for today, Tim in Ohio.
[02:26:19.671 --> 02:26:20.371]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:26:20.952 --> 02:26:22.793]  Alex, I've got to say, you saved the best for last.
[02:26:25.255 --> 02:26:27.917]  That last caller sounded like a page out of Project Megiddo.
[02:26:29.128 --> 02:26:33.111]  Where it says the homeschoolers are evil terrorists, the gun owners are evil terrorists, the FBI flyers.
[02:26:33.311 --> 02:26:39.036]  They have the drills where friends of homeschooling against public education made up groups attack schools.
[02:26:39.116 --> 02:26:42.638]  And anyone that speaks of a New World Order conspiracy.
[02:26:42.859 --> 02:26:43.999]  That's what it says, yeah.
[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:47.862]  So I guess the president's a terrorist then, because him and his daddy talk about it.
[02:26:49.103 --> 02:26:54.948]  I was going to ask you, if it would ever be possible to do a show on the expiration and reparation...
[02:26:56.002 --> 02:26:59.785]  On how we can claim our American citizens back versus U.S.
[02:26:59.805 --> 02:27:00.085]  citizens?
[02:27:00.245 --> 02:27:01.546]  Or you can say your state citizenship.
[02:27:01.566 --> 02:27:02.907]  You know, all of that is real.
[02:27:02.987 --> 02:27:06.769]  They do operate through the 14th Amendment and contract fraud, getting into waiver rights.
[02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:09.251]  The problem is the government is under admiralty law.
[02:27:09.271 --> 02:27:10.892]  It doesn't even follow their own admiralty law.
[02:27:11.252 --> 02:27:14.815]  It's just the force of the gun and the black ski mask and the gulag.
[02:27:14.895 --> 02:27:17.597]  It's just, you do what we say, absolute power.
[02:27:18.077 --> 02:27:20.679]  As the new Attorney General, when he was the Chief Counsel to the President...
[02:27:21.219 --> 02:27:24.182]  On legal matters, Alberto Gonzalez says Bush is the law.
[02:27:24.422 --> 02:27:25.163]  He makes the law.
[02:27:25.203 --> 02:27:26.764]  He can violate federal and state laws.
[02:27:27.025 --> 02:27:28.766]  He is basically God Emperor.
[02:27:29.127 --> 02:27:30.188]  Great, dear leader.
[02:27:30.488 --> 02:27:31.749]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[02:27:32.029 --> 02:27:33.230]  Ton of news straight ahead.

[02:29:45.447 --> 02:29:50.949]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:51.109 --> 02:29:52.170]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:29:52.310 --> 02:29:53.170]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:53.290 --> 02:29:56.131]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:56.311 --> 02:30:01.193]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[02:30:47.875 --> 02:30:53.877]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.298 --> 02:30:57.379]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:59.285 --> 02:31:00.046]  Live!
[02:31:00.546 --> 02:31:04.050]  Live from the Minnesota Mothership Command Base.
[02:31:08.073 --> 02:31:09.054]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:31:09.454 --> 02:31:09.815]  All right.
[02:31:10.595 --> 02:31:12.577]  I want to hurry through some of the subsections.
[02:31:12.697 --> 02:31:14.379]  I'm only looking at about eight pages of these.
[02:31:15.959 --> 02:31:16.279]  We're good to go.
[02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:45.092]  I covered how under Section 501, a U.S.
[02:31:45.112 --> 02:31:50.016]  citizen engaging in lawful activities can be grabbed off the street and thrown into a van, never to be seen again.
[02:31:50.757 --> 02:31:57.382]  The Justice Department states that they can do this because the person had inferred from conduct that they were not a U.S.
[02:31:57.402 --> 02:31:57.803]  citizen.
[02:31:57.823 --> 02:31:59.885]  Again, that's the enemy combatant designation.
[02:32:00.545 --> 02:32:03.668]  And under Section 802, we're basically talking about
[02:32:04.662 --> 02:32:08.523]  Any type of misdemeanor being able to be used as terrorism.
[02:32:08.844 --> 02:32:10.164]  And we've seen the examples of this.
[02:32:10.224 --> 02:32:14.926]  A preacher buying a Koran to analyze the religion for his Sunday school class.
[02:32:15.366 --> 02:32:17.127]  Somebody selling knock-off Rubik's cubes.
[02:32:17.207 --> 02:32:17.827]  Pot dealers.
[02:32:18.207 --> 02:32:21.568]  People paying off county commissioners to get more zoning for parking spaces.
[02:32:22.108 --> 02:32:24.990]  All charged under Patriot Act.
[02:32:25.490 --> 02:32:27.370]  All being persecuted through the Patriot Act.
[02:32:28.151 --> 02:32:28.791]  It's amazing.
[02:32:29.708 --> 02:32:34.393]  But skipping down to some of the subsections that we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:32:34.453 --> 02:32:50.010]  Section 312 gives immunity to law enforcement engaging in spying operations against the American people and would place substantial restrictions on court injunctions against federal violations of civil rights across the board.
[02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:57.756]  Section 101 will designate individual terrorists as foreign powers and again strip them of rights under the enemy combatant designation.
[02:32:58.136 --> 02:33:08.024]  Section 102 states clearly that any information gathering, regardless of whether or not those activities are legal, can be considered to be a clandestine intelligence activities for a foreign power.
[02:33:08.344 --> 02:33:10.986]  This makes news gathering illegal.
[02:33:11.386 --> 02:33:13.608]  And again, this is how they could implement it.
[02:33:13.628 --> 02:33:14.809]  This is what it actually says.
[02:33:15.572 --> 02:33:23.298]  I mean, Bill Clinton signed an executive order for urine and blood testing or other tissue samples back in 1997 to get a driver's license for state standardization.
[02:33:24.178 --> 02:33:26.460]  But that doesn't mean that they're ever going to implement it.
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:28.501]  They're just trying to put this on the books.
[02:33:29.582 --> 02:33:38.028]  But a lot of this they are already implementing even before legislation has ever been passed, like searches without warrants and things like
[02:33:39.406 --> 02:33:39.926]  We're good to go.
[02:34:02.606 --> 02:34:12.351]  FSIA Court, or FISA Court, a panel of secret judges, set up in the Star Chamber system that convenes in an undisclosed location, granted under the first Patriot Act, are not good enough.
[02:34:12.791 --> 02:34:17.874]  It states that government agents must be given immunity for carrying out searches with no prior court approval.
[02:34:18.714 --> 02:34:23.476]  This section throws out the entire Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[02:34:23.957 --> 02:34:32.380]  Section 109 allows secret star chamber courts to issue contempt charges against any individual or corporation who refuses to incriminate themselves or others.
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:38.563]  This section annihilates the last vestiges of the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
[02:34:39.622 --> 02:34:51.150]  Section 110 restates that key police state clauses in the First Patriot Act were not sunsetted and removes the five-year sunset clause from the other subsections of the First Patriot Act.
[02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:54.852]  After all, the media has told us this is the new America.
[02:34:55.112 --> 02:34:55.793]  Get used to it.
[02:34:55.833 --> 02:34:56.553]  This is forever.
[02:34:57.034 --> 02:35:00.476]  Section 111 expands the definition of enemy combatant designation.
[02:35:01.912 --> 02:35:06.753]  Section 122 restates the government's newly announced power of surveillance without a court order.
[02:35:06.773 --> 02:35:10.254]  Again, that's finally in the news, years after they introduced this.
[02:35:10.894 --> 02:35:20.976]  Section 123 restates that the government no longer needs warrants and that the investigations can be a giant, dragnet-style sweep described in press reports about the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:35:21.556 --> 02:35:28.958]  One passage reads, thus the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise than that directed against more conventional types of crime.
[02:35:29.438 --> 02:35:41.364]  Note, over and over again in the subsection after subsection, the Patriot Act, the second Patriot Act, states that its new Soviet-type powers will be used to fight international terrorism, domestic terrorism, and other types of crime.
[02:35:41.724 --> 02:35:47.387]  Of course, the government has already announced in Section 802 of the first Patriot Act that any crime is considered domestic terrorism.
[02:35:48.528 --> 02:35:58.853]  Section 126 grants the government the right to mine the entire spectrum of public and private sector information from megacounts to educational and medical records.
[02:35:59.924 --> 02:36:06.627]  This is enacted into law to allow Echelon and Total Information Awareness Network to totally break down any and all walls of privacy.
[02:36:07.067 --> 02:36:13.090]  The government states that they must look at everything to determine if individuals or groups might have connection to terrorist groups.
[02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:17.892]  As you can now see, you are guilty until proven innocent.
[02:36:17.912 --> 02:36:21.093]  And it's just page after page of a subsection.
[02:36:21.153 --> 02:36:26.796]  Section 127 allows the government to take over coroner's and medical examiner's operations wherever they see fit.
[02:36:27.316 --> 02:36:27.757]  We're good to go.
[02:36:27.777 --> 02:36:28.337]  We're good to go.
[02:36:48.274 --> 02:36:49.356]  We're good to go.
[02:37:05.342 --> 02:37:06.323]  We're good to go.
[02:37:25.698 --> 02:37:29.262]  Section 311 federalizes your local police department in the area of information sharing.
[02:37:29.522 --> 02:37:36.189]  We've got all the articles here today about federal grants for total information awareness network type systems, data mining hooked right into the feds, folks.
[02:37:36.490 --> 02:37:38.632]  Federalization, end of the 10th Amendment, 9th Amendment.
[02:37:39.012 --> 02:37:47.982]  Section 313 provides liability protection for businesses, especially big businesses, that spy on their customers for Homeland Security, violating their privacy agreements, so they get paid by Homeland Security to do that.
[02:37:48.622 --> 02:37:55.925]  Remember last year, the headline USA Today, scofflaws get reported when they order pizzas, and it says big change when you call to get a pizza.
[02:37:56.225 --> 02:38:01.207]  They check your location to see if you have a warrant, and then instantly they get 20% of any court fees or fines.
[02:38:01.927 --> 02:38:05.748]  It goes on to say that these are all preventative measures.
[02:38:06.168 --> 02:38:07.609]  Has anyone seen the Minority Report?
[02:38:07.649 --> 02:38:10.650]  This is the access hub for the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:16.032]  Section 321 authorizes foreign governments to spy on American people and to share information with foreign governments.
[02:38:17.152 --> 02:38:23.756]  Section 322 removes Congress from the extradition process and allows officers of Homeland Security Complex to extradite American citizens anywhere they wish.
[02:38:24.136 --> 02:38:26.697]  You've all heard about the torture flights going out of the country.
[02:38:27.158 --> 02:38:29.079]  One of the Red Sox jets being used, remember that?
[02:38:29.479 --> 02:38:32.861]  It also allows Homeland Security to secretly take individuals out of foreign countries.
[02:38:33.461 --> 02:38:35.842]  No one had even heard of this two years ago when I wrote this analysis.
[02:38:35.882 --> 02:38:36.683]  Now it's all mainstream.
[02:38:37.233 --> 02:38:40.594]  Section 402 is titled Providing Material Support to Terrorism.
[02:38:40.614 --> 02:38:49.377]  This section reads that there is no requirement to show that the individual even had the intent to aid terrorists, but unknowingly did in the past, even before someone was listed as a terrorist.
[02:38:49.797 --> 02:38:55.399]  Section 403 expands the definition of weapons of mass destruction, including activity that affects interstate or foreign commerce.
[02:38:55.779 --> 02:39:00.961]  Section 404 makes it a crime for the terrorist or other criminals to use encryption in the commission of a crime.
[02:39:01.867 --> 02:39:02.167]  Thank you.
[02:39:11.963 --> 02:39:16.425]  Again, removes any statute of limitations for anyone that engages in terrorist actions or supports terrorists.
[02:39:16.725 --> 02:39:19.326]  Remember, any crime is now considered terrorism under the First Patriot Act.
[02:39:19.766 --> 02:39:23.087]  Section 411 expands crimes that are punctual by death.
[02:39:23.147 --> 02:39:29.869]  Again, they point to Section 802 of the First Patriot Act and state that any terrorist act or supported act of terrorism can result in a death penalty.
[02:39:30.229 --> 02:39:32.770]  Section 421 increases penalties for terrorist financing.
[02:39:33.090 --> 02:39:40.012]  This section states that any type of financial activity connected to terrorism will result in time in prison and $10,000 to $50,000 fines per violation.
[02:39:42.273 --> 02:39:48.335]  Section 427 sets up an asset for which it sees provisions for anyone engaging in terrorist activities, which is all misdemeanor activities.
[02:39:48.735 --> 02:39:50.856]  Folks, I sound like an auctioneer.
[02:39:50.876 --> 02:39:52.897]  I'm reading so fast, I can't read the rest of it.
[02:39:53.857 --> 02:39:59.119]  For the video camera taping me in here, because I'm going to put this on TV in Austin, you can see this big old long article.
[02:39:59.179 --> 02:40:04.521]  I mean, there's no way to... I'll do the Rush Limbaugh thing where he goes...
[02:40:05.387 --> 02:40:07.850]  There's no way to read all of this.
[02:40:08.711 --> 02:40:13.175]  This makes Nazi Germany look like a joke, folks, concerning the laws they passed.
[02:40:13.456 --> 02:40:19.102]  This stuff is the type of powers that dictators have given themselves throughout history.
[02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:22.906]  You can read my analysis on the websites right now.
[02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:39.095]  Alright, let me try to get into what the New World Order is briefly, and then I'm going to cover some other news here in the last 18 or 17 minutes that we've got left as I stare at the atomic clock in front of me, 42 minutes and 49 seconds, into this final hour of broadcast.
[02:40:40.255 --> 02:40:44.917]  Let me try to calmly go over this as simply as possible.
[02:40:46.217 --> 02:40:48.598]  I'm sure we all know that organized crime exists.
[02:40:49.238 --> 02:40:51.979]  I'm sure we all know that there are hundreds of thousands of...
[02:40:53.086 --> 02:40:53.646]  We're good to go.
[02:40:53.686 --> 02:40:54.567]  We're good to go.
[02:41:09.423 --> 02:41:09.823]  We're good to go.
[02:41:09.843 --> 02:41:10.644]  We're good to go.
[02:41:29.326 --> 02:41:29.827]  This is the reality.
[02:41:54.275 --> 02:42:05.226]  And so all the New World Order really is, is good old boy networks, a grouping of the most powerful and most wealthy, influential families who've been interbreeding together for at least 400 years.
[02:42:05.727 --> 02:42:07.128]  They like to keep money in the family.
[02:42:08.910 --> 02:42:12.414]  Who have become absolute, total masters.
[02:42:13.317 --> 02:42:23.468]  At buying up media, founding universities, instituting whole philosophical and political ideas, writing the textbooks for the school of thought.
[02:42:23.709 --> 02:42:25.771]  They've given us false maps of the mind.
[02:42:26.932 --> 02:42:29.335]  And I'm asked a lot, you know, if Masons are good or bad.
[02:42:30.236 --> 02:42:33.119]  A lot of founding fathers were Masons.
[02:42:34.861 --> 02:42:37.684]  A lot of the founders of Texas were Masons.
[02:42:37.904 --> 02:42:41.967]  I've had great-grandfathers and great-uncles and people who were Masons, and they weren't evil.
[02:42:42.528 --> 02:42:43.169]  They went to church.
[02:42:43.209 --> 02:42:43.929]  They were Christians.
[02:42:44.089 --> 02:42:44.870]  They read their Bibles.
[02:42:45.571 --> 02:42:48.073]  But they were low-level Masons, my friends.
[02:42:48.673 --> 02:42:51.316]  They didn't know that there are...
[02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:55.711]  Really 360 degrees in the Masonic order.
[02:42:55.751 --> 02:42:57.972]  They think there's only 33 degrees.
[02:42:58.292 --> 02:43:02.713]  Porch masons are only told that there's 33 degrees.
[02:43:02.733 --> 02:43:05.754]  And they're told that when you get to 33, you learn all the big secrets, and that's it.
[02:43:06.014 --> 02:43:12.456]  Well, when you get to 33 degrees, and only in some cases, do you then learn that there are all these other degrees.
[02:43:12.676 --> 02:43:18.018]  And again, they didn't have the word intelligence agency 3,200 years ago with Emotet in Egypt.
[02:43:23.357 --> 02:43:23.757]  Okay.
[02:43:24.438 --> 02:43:33.846]  And back in Egypt and then in Babylon and in other founding civilizations, mathematics was associated with magic.
[02:43:34.487 --> 02:43:37.309]  And they would worship these gods and they worshipped numbers.
[02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:38.470]  They thought, man, this is incredible.
[02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:42.333]  They worshipped the stars and how they moved and thought that they were entities.
[02:43:43.354 --> 02:43:45.876]  Thought that they were gods.
[02:43:47.197 --> 02:43:47.618]  And so...
[02:43:50.490 --> 02:44:01.694]  As time went on, they got more and more power because they knew the mathematics, they knew the science of medicine, and they were the top individuals in the king's court, in the pharaoh's court, in Nebuchadnezzar's court.
[02:44:02.274 --> 02:44:04.775]  They were the top guys in Solomon's court.
[02:44:06.055 --> 02:44:10.057]  And so, you know, Masons tell you that it just goes back to Solomon's temple.
[02:44:10.277 --> 02:44:11.317]  That's low-level Mason stuff.
[02:44:11.337 --> 02:44:12.558]  It goes back to Egypt.
[02:44:12.578 --> 02:44:13.698]  That's where the symbol's the pyramid.
[02:44:15.259 --> 02:44:18.019]  And so, this predates Christianity.
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:19.260]  And
[02:44:20.327 --> 02:44:25.388]  Power always corrupts, and so very early on they got very, very corrupt, very, very abusive.
[02:44:25.788 --> 02:44:32.090]  And the pyramid is their symbol of the slaves below with the capstone and the godhead symbolized by Pharaoh.
[02:44:32.290 --> 02:44:35.111]  And the number two guy for Pharaoh was always his building master.
[02:44:35.471 --> 02:44:37.311]  The number three guy was always his doctor.
[02:44:37.851 --> 02:44:46.093]  And the first university was set up over 3,000 years ago there on the Nile Delta where Cairo is today.
[02:44:47.314 --> 02:44:48.654]  And they set up
[02:44:50.442 --> 02:45:07.761]  These universities, these, quote, mystery schools where they taught you the mysteries, and so mixed in with mathematics and the planets orbiting and all these real things, all this religion, this Luciferian, light-bearing, sun-worship religion got mixed into it.
[02:45:09.316 --> 02:45:16.325]  And then we fast forward to, I don't know, I don't want to get my history wrong, what is it, 2400 years ago?
[02:45:16.785 --> 02:45:17.586]  Or even longer?
[02:45:18.427 --> 02:45:27.198]  Moses is up on Mount Sinai, and the Israelites have left, and a lot of them serve Pharaoh, and a lot of them were builders' servants.
[02:45:27.658 --> 02:45:31.299]  And so these secret universities had taught them a lot of this information.
[02:45:31.339 --> 02:45:38.802]  It also simultaneously spread to Babylon, and it had spread to Greece by 2400, 2500 years ago.
[02:45:39.062 --> 02:45:44.504]  So that's why no matter what secret society it is, it all goes back to this same system.
[02:45:45.982 --> 02:45:52.887]  And that's why modern buildings are built according to these certain cubits and these certain calculations, and there's all these occult trappings.
[02:45:52.947 --> 02:45:59.952]  And Moses goes up on the mountain, he comes down with the Ten Commandments, and he's very angry because the Israelites are all worshipping the golden calf.
[02:45:59.992 --> 02:46:02.894]  They're all back worshipping Molech, the owl.
[02:46:03.415 --> 02:46:10.379]  They're all back worshipping all of these things, and so basically God kills a bunch of them.
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:13.762]  Well, it's that same idea, it's that same group,
[02:46:14.827 --> 02:46:16.048]  And then people say, well, they're builders.
[02:46:16.088 --> 02:46:17.108]  They gave us civilization.
[02:46:17.148 --> 02:46:17.648]  They're good.
[02:46:17.669 --> 02:46:18.409]  They're not bad.
[02:46:19.289 --> 02:46:20.590]  Well, yeah, they built a prison.
[02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:21.771]  They built a control grid.
[02:46:21.791 --> 02:46:26.413]  They've used their knowledge for control and domination and personal power.
[02:46:27.122 --> 02:46:30.723]  And they're in control today, and that's why their symbols are the all-seeing eye.
[02:46:30.943 --> 02:46:32.824]  That's why their symbols are the pyramid.
[02:46:33.084 --> 02:46:39.086]  That's why their symbols are the triple six, or the Time Warner symbol, and the Diamond Shamrock symbol.
[02:46:39.406 --> 02:46:41.627]  And that's why all these symbols are there.
[02:46:42.107 --> 02:46:43.807]  Because, folks, I've studied politics.
[02:46:43.847 --> 02:46:44.427]  I've looked at it.
[02:46:44.668 --> 02:46:45.548]  I never got into this.
[02:46:45.588 --> 02:46:47.869]  I mean, I was just a conservative who wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:48.169 --> 02:46:52.330]  And every time I studied things and followed a rabbit trail, it would end at this door.
[02:46:52.850 --> 02:46:55.591]  And behind it was always this Luciferian cult.
[02:46:56.151 --> 02:46:58.692]  It was always this Luciferian system.
[02:46:59.032 --> 02:47:01.293]  It was always, and they're ruthless.
[02:47:01.333 --> 02:47:02.393]  They see us as scum.
[02:47:02.433 --> 02:47:03.633]  They see us as slaves.
[02:47:03.933 --> 02:47:05.014]  They see us as garbage.
[02:47:05.054 --> 02:47:08.155]  They say, because we don't know all this, we're neophytes.
[02:47:09.175 --> 02:47:15.197]  Or we are basically serfs or peons or minions or slaves.
[02:47:15.237 --> 02:47:22.579]  And they say that it's their right, having this godly knowledge of the great architect, who's Lucifer, to dominate and engineer and control us.
[02:47:23.308 --> 02:47:24.308]  And we say no.
[02:47:24.749 --> 02:47:25.609]  You are abusive.
[02:47:25.649 --> 02:47:26.409]  You are inbred.
[02:47:26.429 --> 02:47:27.310]  You are degenerate.
[02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:28.290]  You are a cancer.
[02:47:28.570 --> 02:47:38.134]  You've used your knowledge to enslave and you've made sure other people didn't learn knowledge because you guys had so much knowledge you realized that all knowledge was important.
[02:47:38.354 --> 02:47:41.535]  And the Bible tells us that the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:47:42.336 --> 02:47:45.798]  And so now today, they're setting up a worldwide police state.
[02:47:46.138 --> 02:47:52.662]  They're setting up a worldwide system of domination and dehumanization and total, absolute control.
[02:47:52.702 --> 02:48:05.150]  And they're putting in their cashless society grid where computers will track and trace everything we do and build detailed psychological algorithms and tracking systems for our mentalities that will even be able to predict what we'll do next.
[02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:06.311]  We're good to go.
[02:48:35.350 --> 02:48:37.451]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:37.511 --> 02:48:38.091]  The New World Order.
[02:49:00.980 --> 02:49:01.941]  Pan Amour.
[02:49:02.002 --> 02:49:06.226]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.286 --> 02:49:13.234]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.354 --> 02:49:15.397]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.697 --> 02:49:26.225]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.326 --> 02:49:31.730]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:50.063 --> 02:51:51.965]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.445 --> 02:51:55.728]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:04.214 --> 02:52:05.455]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:06.616 --> 02:52:10.039]  We are now here into the final segment.
[02:52:10.774 --> 02:52:11.375]  We're good to go.
[02:52:11.455 --> 02:52:12.035]  We're good to go.
[02:52:35.965 --> 02:52:37.787]  And I've enjoyed spending time with the great crew.
[02:52:38.307 --> 02:52:39.668]  Just really nice folks up here.
[02:52:39.688 --> 02:52:41.990]  They've got such good attitudes.
[02:52:42.011 --> 02:52:47.115]  That is so refreshing compared to some of the people over the years that I've worked with.
[02:52:48.016 --> 02:52:56.684]  But before I hit a few final news stories here, my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, is out.
[02:52:56.744 --> 02:52:57.624]  It's my best work.

[02:53:04.927 --> 02:53:06.908]  It covers 9-11 like no other film.
[02:53:06.928 --> 02:53:10.811]  It covers who the New World Order is, the death cult that controls them.
[02:53:10.831 --> 02:53:12.692]  I mean, the real Sith, folks.
[02:53:12.732 --> 02:53:13.753]  This is serious business.
[02:53:14.976 --> 02:53:17.038]  We get into the latest Police State stuff.
[02:53:17.078 --> 02:53:18.159]  It's a very important film.

[02:54:08.549 --> 02:54:12.392]  PrisonPlanet.tv or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:12.672 --> 02:54:14.554]  I mentioned this, but I need to get into it a little bit more.
[02:54:14.974 --> 02:54:16.916]  Placing Mexican flag above Old Glory.
[02:54:16.976 --> 02:54:19.238]  Mexican flag flies in Oregon Employment Office.
[02:54:19.658 --> 02:54:20.378]  Medford, Oregon.
[02:54:20.398 --> 02:54:22.300]  At least they're allowed to fly the American flag.
[02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:23.641]  In South Texas, you can't.
[02:54:24.282 --> 02:54:27.044]  Walking into the Oregon State Employment Office.
[02:54:27.424 --> 02:54:35.166]  At 119 North Oakdale Avenue in Medford, Oregon, can already be a daunting experience for many who are looking for work or have to file a claim.
[02:54:35.206 --> 02:54:36.847]  But to many, it can be a stressful occasion.
[02:54:38.367 --> 02:54:49.210]  Being met by a Mexican flag hostile above the stars and stripes on the back wall of the state-run offices for many, like Earl Howard of Shady Cove, Oregon, downright un-American.
[02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:50.791]  And they got a photo of it.
[02:54:50.831 --> 02:54:55.372]  It is conspicuously above the American flag.
[02:54:56.921 --> 02:55:00.944]  And it is also... Most of the things there are in Spanish.
[02:55:01.024 --> 02:55:04.267]  Again, free health care that citizens don't get.
[02:55:05.188 --> 02:55:05.888]  Free everything.
[02:55:05.988 --> 02:55:08.350]  Free tuition.
[02:55:09.431 --> 02:55:11.012]  Just more of everything.
[02:55:11.092 --> 02:55:11.913]  Total service.
[02:55:11.973 --> 02:55:13.895]  It's about driving the wages down.
[02:55:14.515 --> 02:55:15.956]  You ought to be up here in Minnesota.
[02:55:16.337 --> 02:55:16.537]  I mean...
[02:55:18.605 --> 02:55:21.768]  I mean, you can't be an American, period.
[02:55:21.788 --> 02:55:22.949]  You can't even be a black person.
[02:55:23.430 --> 02:55:24.851]  And it seems to have a job at the airport.
[02:55:24.871 --> 02:55:26.013]  I've been up here three or four times.
[02:55:26.593 --> 02:55:27.614]  And it's all Somalis.
[02:55:28.075 --> 02:55:29.817]  I've never seen a taxi driver in a Somali.
[02:55:30.097 --> 02:55:32.660]  I've never seen somebody working at the airport at the stores in a Somali.
[02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:35.142]  Working at the restaurants, the bars in a Somali.
[02:55:35.403 --> 02:55:37.345]  I haven't seen one of the baggage people in a Somali.
[02:55:37.825 --> 02:55:39.887]  And I guarantee you, people want those jobs, folks.
[02:55:39.967 --> 02:55:45.670]  And again, I'm not against Somali people having jobs, but they import people from the third world to drive down the wages.
[02:55:45.891 --> 02:55:48.252]  They're importing the Indians to take all the high-tech jobs.
[02:55:48.773 --> 02:55:51.174]  And under this new amnesty plan, it'll be unlimited.
[02:55:51.855 --> 02:55:54.676]  So, very, very serious, folks.
[02:55:56.558 --> 02:56:04.263]  Meanwhile, the Border Patrol is in order to stand down, but you're being told to give up all your liberties and take a national ID card or the evil terrorists will get you any second.
[02:56:05.146 --> 02:56:06.968]  Get out there and take on the new world order.
[02:56:35.698 --> 02:56:35.803]  Nope.
