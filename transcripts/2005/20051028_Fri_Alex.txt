[00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:06.094]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:07.816]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:09.657]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:11.099]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:12.820]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.084]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:21.708]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.584]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:35.445]  It is Friday, the 28th day of October 2005.
[00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.465]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:38.626]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:56.706]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:57.807]  I'm going to control myself.
[00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.149]  We're going to do it in the next segment.
[00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:11.499]  Any issue, any news item, any news story you want to talk about, you've got a question, you've got a comment, you disagree with me, any issue, it is open line Friday.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.182]  Regular callers, first-time callers.
[00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:22.012]  Folks that call once a year, anybody who wants to get on board, we want to hear what you have to say and what direction you're going to take us in.
[00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:25.033]  Toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:25.113]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:31.595]  A lot of news to cover today as well, and I'm sure that you've already heard, now ABC News is reporting,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:55.389]  That sometime today, while they have this concrete from a source inside, Scooter Libby, Dick Cheney's chief of staff, will be indicted.
[00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.035]  So we'll get into this report as soon as we get back from this quick break.
[00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:12.681]  Prosecutor's office to seek charges against Cheney Aid, and for now, good old...
[00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:16.740]  Carl Rove, George Bush's deputy chief of staff.
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.941]  He really is his chief of staff.
[00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.323]  But the power behind the throne never likes that to be known.
[00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:24.844]  His escaping indictment.
[00:02:24.884 --> 00:02:32.749]  But it was pointed out on Monday that Fitzgerald was expanding his office space in Chicago and getting D.C.
[00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:33.549]  office space.
[00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.651]  So this investigation is going to be ongoing.
[00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:41.694]  And now what it looks like to me is the globalists, for some reason, want leverage on Bush.
[00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:43.965]  As if they don't already have enough of it.
[00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:50.727]  And this is just going to be an ongoing theater in the next couple years, just like Iran-Contra.
[00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:53.367]  So our prediction is beginning to come true.
[00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:56.308]  Unfortunately, I'd love to see George Bush impeached.
[00:02:56.328 --> 00:02:57.528]  I'd love to see Bill Clinton impeached.
[00:02:57.848 --> 00:02:59.749]  I'd love to see both of them in prison together.
[00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:07.910]  Instead of putting your children in prison when they use the drugs that Bill Clinton and George Bush ship in.
[00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.471]  I'd like to see these kingpins in jail, but don't
[00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:13.816]  Don't hold your breath.
[00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:14.977]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:18.379]  Bird flu is hitting fever pitch.
[00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.221]  Obviously, cases of it in birds.
[00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:25.203]  Popping up birds that have been shipped into England, Germany, Russia.
[00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:30.667]  And just the news is constantly quacking, pun intended.
[00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:39.173]  Squealing, really, not quacking, that it just, we're all dead, give up all your rights, only martial law will save us.
[00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:53.076]  I did indeed confirm that Cheney's former top aide got up on C-SPAN yesterday, I'm still trying to get the clip, and said our government may bring in martial law to control the population.
[00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:58.497]  So, I mean, there's Ron Paul and senior members of the State Department and others saying this.
[00:03:58.557 --> 00:03:59.317]  I mean, this is getting...
[00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.110]  Scarier and scarier.
[00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.891]  We are in very precarious times right now.
[00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:08.232]  Anything could happen.
[00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:23.639]  Flashpoint, critical mass, crossroads, zenith, jump point, whatever buzzword you want to use, we are in very treacherous waters right now.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.681]  And I want to get your take on it.
[00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.945]  What do you think is going to happen in the next month, the next week, the next year, the next ten years?
[00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:31.646]  How do we defeat this new world order?
[00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:38.112]  People are waking up more than ever, but the agenda still moves on because the globalists control the infrastructure.
[00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:43.237]  How do we defeat the cashless society control grid tracking system?
[00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:44.578]  How do we do it?
[00:04:44.598 --> 00:04:47.220]  1-800- I want to hear solutions today.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.300]  1-800-259-
[00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.274]  90-231.
[00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:53.917]  Great event last night.
[00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:56.702]  I want to thank all those that came out to the Alamo Theater.
[00:04:56.742 --> 00:04:57.844]  It was overflow.
[00:04:57.884 --> 00:04:58.405]  Great seeing you.
[00:04:58.425 --> 00:04:58.966]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.107 --> 00:05:07.932]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:09.633]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:12.034]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.276]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:19.479]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.842]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:25.864]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:36.592]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.752 --> 00:05:38.654]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:42.737]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:42.817 --> 00:05:44.379]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.959]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:52.546]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.612]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:06.834]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:13.280]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.966]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:25.230]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.032]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:44.357]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:53.160]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Screwed in Places USA now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:03.663]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:08.844]  We all eat sugars, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:15.226]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:21.148]  That's why a Garicus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:26.910]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.991]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:37.313]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:07:37.694 --> 00:07:38.414]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:38.454 --> 00:07:43.156]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:07:43.316 --> 00:07:47.457]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:50.618]  Well, with a Garricus bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:55.700]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.321]  A Garricus bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:08:01.243 --> 00:08:03.504]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:06.825]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.467 --> 00:08:22.930]  Net-busting hate bill ready.
[00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:32.418]  Senator Edward Kennedy will attach his hate crimes bill, S-1145, onto the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
[00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:41.985]  So see, now if you're against thought crime laws in America, why, you must be with the child molesters or the perverts.
[00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:45.748]  And of course, the bill has nothing
[00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:47.011]  We're good to go.
[00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:47.452]  We're good to go.
[00:09:15.256 --> 00:09:25.528]  We've been reporting that they just continually pop it into other bills or pork barrel it onto other bills, so we'll track that as it develops.
[00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:33.858]  There is a new nominee expected to be announced by this afternoon, or they're saying maybe on Monday.
[00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:38.108]  With the pullout of Ms.
[00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:43.949]  Myers yesterday, and people are really focused on this, but frankly, it doesn't matter.
[00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:46.870]  Whoever they put in is going to be bad.
[00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.931]  You can be absolutely assured of that.
[00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:59.553]  Seven of the current nine that have been in the court were appointed by Republicans.
[00:09:59.873 --> 00:10:03.514]  And on record, they vote with the Democrats
[00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:10.505]  And the Democrats vote with them for police state, for loss of private property, for gun control.
[00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:19.311]  And it has now emerged, CBS News, they're quite proud of him that Chief Justice Roberts is anti-Second Amendment.
[00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:25.515]  So they're stacking the court to set up a case in the future to rule there is no Second Amendment.
[00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:29.618]  And the news will tell us, you thought it was a right, but now it isn't.
[00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:34.251]  Just like you thought private property was a right, but now it isn't.
[00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.554]  Not if some private interest wants it.
[00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:41.339]  I mean, it's mind-boggling.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.743]  So, new court nominee expected within days.
[00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:52.451]  President Bush eager to put a brushing brawl within his own party behind him.
[00:10:54.827 --> 00:11:00.451]  Is expected to announce his new pick for the Supreme Court within days.
[00:11:02.272 --> 00:11:08.877]  And yes, ABC News is reporting that Scooter Libby will be indicted today.
[00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:15.922]  That he will be publicly delivered the indictment today.
[00:11:17.183 --> 00:11:21.626]  Well, let me just pull out the actual ABC News headline.
[00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.788]  But the media has been wrong about this before.
[00:11:24.548 --> 00:11:31.950]  The Financial Times of London said that they would be indicted yesterday, and there would be multiple individuals, and that did not happen.
[00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:38.612]  So, just because ABC News has this headline, I don't know that's really going to happen.
[00:11:38.952 --> 00:11:45.433]  Headline, ABC News has learned Scooter Libby, Cheney's chief of staff, will be indicted today.
[00:11:46.474 --> 00:11:51.355]  Then they just say, sources, very close to the grand jury, have confirmed...
[00:11:52.091 --> 00:11:57.213]  Poor ABC News that Scooter Libby will be indicted today.
[00:11:57.273 --> 00:12:00.274]  So we'll take your calls and see what you think about that in a few minutes.
[00:12:01.015 --> 00:12:03.636]  I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but it's important.
[00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:09.378]  I've been turning down a lot of radio interviews lately.
[00:12:09.418 --> 00:12:14.280]  Only because I'm trying to make a new film, and it gets exhausting.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.742]  Three or four years ago, I loved doing radio interviews, but you start doing...
[00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:27.539]  Two or three, four a day for months on end, at all hours of the early morning and at night, you just can't do it anymore.
[00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:43.510]  That said, I occasionally, even though I'm kind of semi-burnout at times, you can't focus on this all the time, I do try to call into radio talk shows.
[00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.412]  I don't know why I just told the story of not...
[00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:53.418]  Turning down interviews because I want to spend time with my family and friends.
[00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:56.180]  You know, have a few hours a day off.
[00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:58.122]  Maybe an hour more of sleep.
[00:12:58.142 --> 00:12:58.902]  You know, things like that.
[00:12:59.222 --> 00:13:00.183]  It's 6 a.m.
[00:13:00.223 --> 00:13:02.004]  You went to bed at 2 a.m.
[00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:05.207]  Time to go do some radio interview in New York City.
[00:13:06.268 --> 00:13:08.629]  You know, at a certain point, you're like, that's crazy.
[00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.591]  I'm going to sleep until 8.30.
[00:13:11.712 --> 00:13:15.034]  I'm not going to get up at 6 if I work until 2 o'clock in the morning.
[00:13:17.717 --> 00:13:22.742]  That said, I still, you know, I'm driving around in my car, I occasionally try to call into talk shows.
[00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:27.246]  And I've called into national talk shows, and they will grill you.
[00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:29.488]  What do you want to talk about?
[00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:31.210]  What's the point you want to make?
[00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:39.938]  And if it's a cogent point that isn't left-wing or right-wing, they will not let you on some of these national talk shows.
[00:13:39.978 --> 00:13:41.219]  They are screening the calls.
[00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:49.909]  Now, in all fairness, they didn't really screen my call when I called in one time on the Mike Gallagher Show here locally.
[00:13:53.991 --> 00:14:06.976]  But every time I try to call in to KLBJ AM here locally in Austin, this isn't syndicated, this is local, it is the greatest grilling I have ever experienced.
[00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:10.543]  It's like a pre-interview or something.
[00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:15.286]  Sometimes when some national TV outfit's going to come interview me, they'll ask questions on the phone.
[00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:21.570]  Just trying to gauge and get an idea of what they can expect or if I'm well-versed on the subject or if they want to talk to me.
[00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.772]  And that happens occasionally for big radio interviews.
[00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:26.653]  And frankly, I just tell them, I don't have time.
[00:14:26.673 --> 00:14:28.014]  If you want to have me on, you can have me on.
[00:14:28.374 --> 00:14:31.175]  I've only done this about, I don't know how many thousands of times.
[00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:33.257]  Thousands and thousands of times since...
[00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:37.757]  9-11 alone, and probably 500 times before that.
[00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:40.838]  But the point is, I mean, I quit counting the interviews in the thousands.
[00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:54.062]  But to make a long story short, you know, this sounds petty, and compared to all the other news, it's not that important, but it goes towards free speech.
[00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:57.203]  I've done tests.
[00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:01.685]  You know, I've been what you call dishonest in this state of war.
[00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:05.690]  Just to test and see if my hypothesis was correct.
[00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.170]  I can call back and act stupid and get right on the air.
[00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:09.690]  Literally.
[00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.431]  And it's happened with national talk shows.
[00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:19.432]  I can call in, get in, and you can tell they're screening, you know, nine out of ten calls, they'll make it through.
[00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:28.054]  And if you're cogent and focused and have a point, they won't let you on if you disagree with the government.
[00:15:29.753 --> 00:15:35.856]  But if you act totally mindless and say you don't like George Bush, I don't like George Bush, he's dumb.
[00:15:36.656 --> 00:15:38.777]  And I don't like the conservatives.
[00:15:39.737 --> 00:15:40.918]  Literally, I've talked like that.
[00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.819]  I've sat there while my wife's laughing next to me.
[00:15:43.239 --> 00:15:45.160]  Go doing that, and boom, get right on the air.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.002]  And then suddenly I'm not stupid, and they'll cycle you off real quick.
[00:15:50.022 --> 00:15:58.045]  I mean, you actually, in this propaganda-driven world, you have to be dishonest to even get on these shows that have a little bit of free speech.
[00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:01.688]  You know, the free press is great, especially if you own one.
[00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.590]  I forget who said that, but it's a classic line.
[00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:17.959]  I mean, really, it's great to own my own press, to have Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and to have my own radio show, and then to not screen your calls and give you a chance to call in, say what your first name is, and where you're calling from.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.223]  I guess the closest we get to screening calls is if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:16:26.327 --> 00:16:29.329]  And occasionally we've got a guest on a limited time.
[00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:32.490]  I'll say, hey, we're talking about bird flu.
[00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.992]  We're talking about the Federal Reserve right now.
[00:16:35.012 --> 00:16:39.114]  I mean, I might do that once or twice a month when it's kind of rude.
[00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:42.716]  You know, we've got a guest on, and every caller wants to talk about something else.
[00:16:42.776 --> 00:16:47.458]  But we're going to go to Kenneth and Michael and Dave and Bart and Tim and others.
[00:16:47.478 --> 00:16:52.281]  We're going to take calls for the entire three hours today, interspersed with all this important news.
[00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.402]  But what am I getting up to?
[00:16:56.247 --> 00:16:57.768]  I like Emmis.
[00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.972]  That's who owns KLBJ now.
[00:17:02.612 --> 00:17:04.394]  The Johnsons don't own it anymore.
[00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:12.680]  And local KLBJ FM has me on whenever I want to come on, or they call me and have me on, and I really appreciate it.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.402]  They have like the number one radio show in the morning.
[00:17:16.824 --> 00:17:20.907]  But the FM, and I've even been in the FM studio when George Norrie was in town.
[00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:21.988]  You know, he came to Austin.
[00:17:23.024 --> 00:17:26.170]  And, you know, I was there in studio with George Norrie, really honored.
[00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:32.681]  But the call screener during the day on the Jeff Ward show, Jeff Ward...
[00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:36.148]  Keeps going, I don't know why oil prices are so high.
[00:17:36.168 --> 00:17:37.769]  I don't know why I'm paying so much at the pump.
[00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:41.651]  And it's caller after caller going, the oil companies aren't making big profits.
[00:17:41.971 --> 00:17:43.993]  The oil companies are allowed to make big profits.
[00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.474]  The oil companies don't set the price of oil.
[00:17:46.754 --> 00:17:48.275]  There's not a scam going on.
[00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:49.396]  They're not ripping us off.
[00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:51.417]  That's just liberal lies.
[00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:52.358]  Liberal lies?
[00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:53.158]  What does that even mean?
[00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:54.619]  Everything's liberal.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.921]  Turn your guns in or you're liberal.
[00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.962]  Be for Bush and open borders or you're liberal.
[00:17:59.242 --> 00:18:03.225]  It's just some mindless little diadem they pin on you.
[00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:09.589]  And so I call in and I say, well, the L.A.
[00:18:09.629 --> 00:18:18.142]  Times reported about a month ago that the three major oil companies, Texaco, ExxonMobil, Shell...
[00:18:19.844 --> 00:18:33.297]  All got together in 96 and said we're going to artificially buy up a whole bunch of refineries and shut them down and reduce the output of our refineries all across the United States, the refineries we own, to artificially jack up prices.
[00:18:33.657 --> 00:18:36.800]  Because you'll have a huge increase in crude oil at the pump.
[00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:43.773]  At the wellhead price, but it doesn't translate over to what happens at the pump.
[00:18:43.793 --> 00:18:50.374]  It'll be many, many times higher than what the increase was in the oil, with a healthy profit in there for them.
[00:18:50.975 --> 00:18:54.456]  And OPEC is the cartel.
[00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.837]  OPEC is a cartel.
[00:19:01.658 --> 00:19:09.557]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it, but we have red-handed evidence of how they're scamming us at the refinery level.
[00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:16.224]  This talk show host is on there going, I want the answer, I want the answer, I just don't trust him.
[00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:17.745]  And he's saying something I agree with.
[00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:18.906]  You know, something stinks here.
[00:19:19.246 --> 00:19:23.927]  And these idiots are all on there saying, no, no, the government's good, and the oil companies are good.
[00:19:24.188 --> 00:19:30.670]  And I call in, stuck in traffic, and the guy just goes, thank you for your point of view, but that's not what we're looking for.
[00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.511]  It's not what you're looking for?
[00:19:34.652 --> 00:19:36.672]  Calling in with the answer to the question?
[00:19:36.952 --> 00:19:38.093]  It's not what you're looking for?
[00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:42.524]  And folks, I probably try to call in there three or four times a year.
[00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:45.266]  They never let me on.
[00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:47.448]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:19:47.528 --> 00:19:51.390]  But I know that many other stations do that to you as well.
[00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.052]  I mean, I know that's part of this industry now.
[00:19:54.512 --> 00:19:55.773]  And I think it's shameful.
[00:19:56.473 --> 00:19:57.394]  I think it's shameful.
[00:20:01.337 --> 00:20:01.897]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:02.237]  I think?
[00:20:23.903 --> 00:20:24.363]  We're good to go.
[00:20:24.403 --> 00:20:24.603]  I think?
[00:20:47.575 --> 00:20:48.015]  Act now.
[00:20:48.135 --> 00:20:53.839]  Visit us online at ResearchedHerbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.
[00:20:53.859 --> 00:20:54.080]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.702]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:21:05.007 --> 00:21:08.510]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.574]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:21:12.754 --> 00:21:18.919]  Black murky replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.339 --> 00:21:27.246]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:21:27.646 --> 00:21:28.547]  We're good to go.
[00:21:43.017 --> 00:21:46.218]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:53.240]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.641]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:00.851]  We're good to go.
[00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:01.071]  I think?
[00:22:27.042 --> 00:22:29.543]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:03.457]  Government is best which governs least.
[00:23:03.997 --> 00:23:05.319]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:08.442]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:08.902 --> 00:23:11.545]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:11.985 --> 00:23:18.432]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:23:18.652 --> 00:23:19.413]  We're good to go.
[00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:40.755]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:41.255]  Have you?
[00:23:41.836 --> 00:23:43.357]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:47.561]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:23:48.722 --> 00:23:51.565]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:53.066]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:23:53.607 --> 00:23:54.808]  Osama been forgotten.
[00:23:55.248 --> 00:23:58.892]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:07.562]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.223 --> 00:24:10.583]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.603 --> 00:24:17.525]  But I wasn't going to talk about censorship and talk radio.
[00:24:17.725 --> 00:24:20.025]  I wasn't going to do it.
[00:24:20.785 --> 00:24:23.686]  You know, that's one thing I always liked about Art Bell.
[00:24:25.406 --> 00:24:27.647]  Is that he just randomly took phone calls...
[00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:29.194]  From people that called in.
[00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:32.135]  I know George Norrie does that to a certain extent.
[00:24:32.395 --> 00:24:41.157]  I mean, I understand making sure somebody can complete sentences and that their phone sounds half decent.
[00:24:41.177 --> 00:24:46.739]  I mean, we've actually told people, sorry, you can't come on air every once in a while when the phone literally sounds like this.
[00:24:48.699 --> 00:24:49.920]  And you can barely hear them in the background.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:50.960]  Hey, is that all right?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.180]  Can I come on?
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.141]  No, your phone's too bad.
[00:24:54.361 --> 00:24:55.181]  You can't come on.
[00:24:55.948 --> 00:24:57.769]  And occasionally I'll go, okay, we'll put you on.
[00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:58.650]  I put them on.
[00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.470]  You've heard the calls.
[00:25:00.211 --> 00:25:03.933]  I like to let them talk for five seconds just so you know we're on.
[00:25:04.714 --> 00:25:07.056]  But to never be able to get through on that show.
[00:25:08.296 --> 00:25:10.078]  And there's the host in complete ignorance.
[00:25:10.478 --> 00:25:11.739]  I don't know why it's so much.
[00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:12.879]  Something stinks out of heaven.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.101]  An idiot caller after idiot caller.
[00:25:15.721 --> 00:25:18.543]  No, the old companies, they ain't ripping us off.
[00:25:18.603 --> 00:25:19.704]  That is good.
[00:25:20.164 --> 00:25:23.787]  When their own admitted public documents...
[00:25:25.052 --> 00:25:25.632]  Are out.
[00:25:25.752 --> 00:25:27.392]  But it hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.
[00:25:27.412 --> 00:25:29.413]  Remember when that broke about three weeks ago?
[00:25:29.933 --> 00:25:38.354]  I went on George Norrie's show with Paul Watson, and we were able to talk about it there, but not here locally in Austin.
[00:25:38.574 --> 00:25:42.295]  Boy, there is a news blackout on that information.
[00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:45.136]  But here's the New York Times today.
[00:25:45.236 --> 00:25:49.416]  Big rise in profit puts oil giants on defensives.
[00:25:51.377 --> 00:25:52.217]  I'm inventing words.
[00:25:52.257 --> 00:25:52.837]  Defensives.
[00:25:53.732 --> 00:25:57.594]  Big rise in profits puts oil giants on defensive.
[00:25:58.134 --> 00:26:12.019]  A sudden interruption in oil supplies sent prices and profits skyrocketing, prompting Exxon's chief executive to call a news conference right after his company announced that it had chopped up record earnings.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.681]  I am not embarrassed, he said.
[00:26:14.701 --> 00:26:17.102]  This is no windfall.
[00:26:18.282 --> 00:26:20.483]  Well, there's nothing wrong with making money.
[00:26:21.866 --> 00:26:27.250]  But if you do it as part of a cartel or a monopoly or an oligopoly, it is.
[00:26:28.892 --> 00:26:42.722]  And the fact that millions of northerners and westerners are going to pay roughly double for their coal oil and their natural gas that heats their homes is an abomination.
[00:26:43.723 --> 00:26:47.166]  It's an abomination that they've shut down many of the clean burning coal mines.
[00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:58.424]  It's an abomination that the oil companies have bought up key coal oil producing facilities and restricted that and created an artificial scarcity and a loggerhead.
[00:26:59.644 --> 00:27:13.050]  It's a travesty that they have been monopolizing and buying up most of the pipelines and the refineries as well as the wells themselves with natural gas and creating artificial scarcity.
[00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.111]  When we got so much natural gas, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:26.597]  I mean, from Texas to Oklahoma to Illinois to Indiana, just right in the middle of the country, is just pure gas from the coast right up into Canada.
[00:27:26.757 --> 00:27:31.041]  I mean, just there is enough to basically run the country forever.
[00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:33.843]  I mean, it's just ridiculous amounts of it.
[00:27:34.124 --> 00:27:37.366]  But no, they've artificially run a scam.
[00:27:37.887 --> 00:27:40.349]  And we have their own admissions that are doing it.
[00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.432]  And you read this New York Times article, it never...
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.521]  It never gives you any facts.
[00:27:46.601 --> 00:27:54.706]  It just, well, this person says they are running a scam, and that person says they aren't, and this person says profits are too big, and it's bad to have profits.
[00:27:55.227 --> 00:28:01.471]  So the New York Times kind of has this socialistic model when you're just acting like it's bad to make money.
[00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:04.633]  Never a discussion of how it's a cartel or how it's a scam.
[00:28:07.795 --> 00:28:09.296]  I am not embarrassed, he said.
[00:28:09.316 --> 00:28:10.577]  This is no windfall.
[00:28:10.637 --> 00:28:12.118]  But that was a press conference in 1974 in January.
[00:28:14.913 --> 00:28:23.521]  A few months after Arab oil producers cut back on supplies, folks, that was totally staged, that's admitted, and imposed their short-lived embargo on exports to the United States.
[00:28:24.021 --> 00:28:25.643]  That was totally set up by the oil companies.
[00:28:26.163 --> 00:28:27.885]  Oil executives, including J.K.
[00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:37.053]  Jameson, Exxon's chief executive at the time, were put on the defensive force to justify their soaring profits while the nation was facing its first ever energy crisis.
[00:28:37.753 --> 00:28:41.577]  Yeah, folks, it's a scam.
[00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:44.351]  And we know it's a scam.
[00:28:44.852 --> 00:28:46.652]  We can prove that that was a scam.
[00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:48.913]  The barges just lay there sitting off our coast.
[00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:50.573]  Our government wouldn't let them in.
[00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:52.674]  The refineries just shut down.
[00:28:53.154 --> 00:29:02.296]  It was all through the entire food chain, the industrial chain, right to your car, right to the gas pump.
[00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:02.936]  They did this.
[00:29:03.777 --> 00:29:12.019]  And imagine, imagine hearing nothing but babble and tripe on a radio show, and you call in and they just go, sorry, we don't want people to know that.
[00:29:13.121 --> 00:29:16.142]  Sorry, we're not looking for that view.
[00:29:16.963 --> 00:29:20.224]  See, I'm not looking for that view.
[00:29:20.304 --> 00:29:21.025]  Thank you.
[00:29:21.105 --> 00:29:22.045]  I'm the call screener.
[00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:23.286]  I'm God.
[00:29:23.946 --> 00:29:27.087]  I'm not... We're not looking for that right now.
[00:29:27.167 --> 00:29:27.628]  Thank you.
[00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:30.469]  Thank you.
[00:29:31.129 --> 00:29:32.350]  But don't you want them to know?
[00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.991]  Did you hear about the oil companies running the scam?
[00:29:36.011 --> 00:29:37.712]  It was in the LA Times and Washington Post.
[00:29:37.772 --> 00:29:38.272]  Seriously.
[00:29:40.296 --> 00:29:40.716]  You know what?
[00:29:40.897 --> 00:29:41.497]  Thanks a lot.
[00:29:41.877 --> 00:29:42.418]  Appreciate it.
[00:29:42.798 --> 00:29:43.399]  Bye-bye now.
[00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:46.862]  All right, well, we're going to come back, and we're going to take your calls.
[00:29:46.882 --> 00:29:49.124]  You're not going to be sent yet.
[00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:52.607]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.087 --> 00:29:54.689]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.609 --> 00:29:58.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.992 --> 00:30:04.473]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:09.856]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:11.376]  But now, we don't have to.
[00:30:11.656 --> 00:30:19.820]  This sacral wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.162]  Simply line your back with the sacral wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:27.203]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[00:30:27.603 --> 00:30:31.105]  Use the sacral wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.

[00:30:41.867 --> 00:30:44.748]  And ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment, too.
[00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:47.448]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[00:30:47.769 --> 00:30:51.069]  Get your sacral wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.

[00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:05.348]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.909]  are located?
[00:31:06.109 --> 00:31:09.492]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:14.436]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:32:01.764 --> 00:32:02.304]  We're good to go.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:31.724]  It's already the second most popular currency in the US, with 100,000 people using it to protect their purchasing power.
[00:32:32.104 --> 00:32:39.908]  G. Edward Griffin, the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, endorses and urges all Americans to get silver liberty dollars and beat inflation today.
[00:32:40.309 --> 00:32:42.730]  Don't stand by and watch your hard-earned money lose value.
[00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:43.551]  We're good to go.
[00:33:01.844 --> 00:33:03.306]  We're good to go.
[00:33:27.313 --> 00:33:28.394]  All right, welcome back.
[00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:31.336]  Let's go ahead and start taking your calls.
[00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.877]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[00:33:33.917 --> 00:33:34.677]  Kenneth, welcome.
[00:33:35.518 --> 00:33:35.918]  Hello, Alex.
[00:33:36.338 --> 00:33:38.420]  I just want to say you have a good product.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.882]  You put a lot of good information out, and you think outside the bun.
[00:33:43.102 --> 00:33:45.264]  I'm going to ask Taco Bell, you think outside the box.
[00:33:46.885 --> 00:33:51.087]  You know, the New World Order is a monster, and it's run by snakes.
[00:33:51.187 --> 00:33:54.069]  Snakes come out their holes, and they go back in their holes.
[00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:59.652]  Now the monster that's in them is only the monster that's in the common people.
[00:33:59.712 --> 00:34:15.637]  When the common people sin and fornicate and have idolatry and worship the flag or something like that, it only gives comfort to the outside monster, which is the new world order or whatever, for vitamins for their system.
[00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:20.179]  So when the common people repent and reduce their sins,
[00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:24.854]  Then the governmental New World Order will shrink also.
[00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.037]  So it's... You know what I'm saying?
[00:34:27.838 --> 00:34:28.619]  Get what I'm talking about?
[00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:29.960]  Oh no, they know that.
[00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:33.645]  And when you're decadent and don't care about anybody but yourself...
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.981]  And none of us are perfect, folks.
[00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:37.322]  I'm not up here on some high horse.
[00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:49.708]  But when you just don't even care, and you don't even spend time being involved in your community, and you're just out mindlessly partying 24-7, you become an enslaved society.
[00:34:50.048 --> 00:34:52.510]  That's happened with the decline of Rome.
[00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.811]  It happened with the decline of Babylon, of Egypt.
[00:34:55.605 --> 00:35:04.189]  Of Greece, people get prosperous, they get decadent, they do become sinful, and societies fall apart.
[00:35:04.789 --> 00:35:05.649]  And you're right.
[00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.410]  That's why they try to corrupt us.
[00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:16.914]  That's why they tell us torture's good on the news, and torture's good in the sitcoms, and torture's good in the dramas like 24 and Threat Matrix and CSI.
[00:35:18.226 --> 00:35:19.087]  We're good to go.
[00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:47.629]  I ducked in while my film was showing, because I've seen my new film about 50 times, Order of Death, and it's a great video, but I can't watch it that many times.
[00:35:47.929 --> 00:36:00.233]  So I ducked into Doom, which is a movie about the violent video game, where you're down in some underground bunker, labyrinth, killing humans that are mutating into these demon creatures.
[00:36:01.734 --> 00:36:06.836]  And so I stepped in there for five minutes, and it was just...
[00:36:07.961 --> 00:36:09.362]  Continual slaughter.
[00:36:09.462 --> 00:36:10.483]  Continual death.
[00:36:10.923 --> 00:36:15.266]  And the point is that most people never experience slaughter or death.
[00:36:16.847 --> 00:36:21.069]  They haven't even shot a wild hog and then gutted it and hung it up.
[00:36:21.629 --> 00:36:23.030]  They have no connection to anything.
[00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.852]  I've never been in combat killing people, thank God.
[00:36:26.933 --> 00:36:28.914]  But at least I have a little more connection to it.
[00:36:29.614 --> 00:36:31.876]  Hunting deer and having to...
[00:36:32.476 --> 00:36:35.439]  To gut them and being in a few fistfights.
[00:36:35.499 --> 00:36:40.103]  I mean, at least there's some connection to real violence, some experience of it.
[00:36:40.404 --> 00:36:46.830]  But what we have is this, I mean, imagine for military people that have really actually been in real close quarters combat.
[00:36:48.791 --> 00:36:50.153]  And thanks for the call, Kenneth.
[00:36:50.193 --> 00:36:51.774]  I mean, I'm already kind of ranting here.
[00:36:52.194 --> 00:36:55.898]  But the point I'm trying to get at is that we're being desensitized.
[00:36:56.761 --> 00:37:03.488]  I mean, people 50, 60 years ago would be offended by violence, not because they were wimps and couldn't handle it.
[00:37:04.028 --> 00:37:08.733]  I mean, I know a lot of real vets that are quiet people who've been in Vietnam, Korea.
[00:37:08.753 --> 00:37:10.735]  I know old World War II vets.
[00:37:10.775 --> 00:37:11.636]  Most of them have died.
[00:37:11.936 --> 00:37:12.337]  Family.
[00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:16.874]  People like that, they were very offended by violent movies.
[00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:23.620]  Very offended by images of people being shot and guts being blown all over the wall.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.661]  Because they've actually seen that.
[00:37:25.722 --> 00:37:27.943]  The smell of it comes back to them.
[00:37:27.963 --> 00:37:28.924]  The smell of blood.
[00:37:29.204 --> 00:37:30.105]  The smell of fear.
[00:37:30.526 --> 00:37:32.467]  The smell of their body dying in their arms.
[00:37:33.828 --> 00:37:35.450]  And so there's a cheapening of it.
[00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.792]  There's a cheapening of the violence.
[00:37:37.872 --> 00:37:39.213]  There's a cheapening of sex.
[00:37:41.224 --> 00:37:51.653]  It's like a comedian said, and I'm not trying to get racy here, but a comedian I know said that going to a topless bar, he's not looking at the women that are topless because it's all just right out in the open in your face.
[00:37:51.913 --> 00:37:59.360]  He's looking at the waitress and trying to get a view on her because she's the one that's covered up.
[00:37:59.938 --> 00:38:02.659]  And obviously I'm not saying women should wear burkas over their heads.
[00:38:03.159 --> 00:38:05.460]  It's just that there's a cheapening of the woman.
[00:38:05.741 --> 00:38:07.421]  And they say, oh, you're trying to control women.
[00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:09.922]  You're trying to keep women from having a good time.
[00:38:09.962 --> 00:38:15.805]  You're trying to stifle their sexuality.
[00:38:17.146 --> 00:38:18.626]  No, I'm not.
[00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:19.787]  Women can do what they want.
[00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:26.310]  But certainly, I'm not going to lie, it isn't painful on the eyes when women are scampily dressed.
[00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.251]  But still, it cheapens womanhood.
[00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:35.215]  And you know, when men are stomping around, I mean, frankly, it's offensive.
[00:38:35.756 --> 00:38:40.620]  And it is hard on the eyes to be at the swimming pool and some man is in a thong.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.262]  You know, I'm there with my family.
[00:38:43.503 --> 00:38:44.504]  I don't want to look at that.
[00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:46.986]  I don't know.
[00:38:47.046 --> 00:38:49.469]  It's just that we're turning into animals, folks.
[00:38:50.149 --> 00:38:51.511]  That's the point I'm trying to make.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:02.623]  You know, to go to a neighborhood swimming pool, and there's full-grown men walking around, basically, you know, in skimpy underwear.
[00:39:02.663 --> 00:39:04.183]  I mean, what's wrong with this country?
[00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:06.404]  But again, it's all been cheapened.
[00:39:07.084 --> 00:39:09.625]  Our sensitivity has been seared.
[00:39:11.026 --> 00:39:14.047]  And here's the separation.
[00:39:14.127 --> 00:39:18.028]  I mean, you don't really get your conscience seared easily.
[00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:31.717]  By actually engaging in combat, from those I've talked to, or from actually, let's say, engaging in street fighting, you actually get more attuned, more sensitive to it.
[00:39:32.691 --> 00:39:34.592]  More aware of how real it is.
[00:39:35.132 --> 00:39:43.376]  But the complete opposite was for ten minutes I sat there with my mouth hanging open because it was just... It went on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:39:43.716 --> 00:39:44.997]  Machine gun that monster.
[00:39:45.077 --> 00:39:46.037]  Kill this monster.
[00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.798]  Kill this pus monster.
[00:39:47.858 --> 00:39:49.719]  Kill that maggot monster.
[00:39:49.819 --> 00:39:50.439]  Kill this.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.100]  On and on and on and on.
[00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:55.281]  And it's just mindless.
[00:39:55.441 --> 00:39:56.942]  It's just totally mindless.
[00:39:56.962 --> 00:39:58.483]  And then Hollywood says, well...
[00:39:59.275 --> 00:40:00.995]  That's what the people want.
[00:40:01.115 --> 00:40:02.696]  That's what the people demand.
[00:40:03.616 --> 00:40:09.737]  And really, I saw a Frontline special a few years ago that I thought was excellent and explained that that's not really true.
[00:40:10.837 --> 00:40:13.958]  Hollywood creates false markets.
[00:40:14.058 --> 00:40:17.178]  They create false desire.
[00:40:17.818 --> 00:40:19.178]  That's what their experts say.
[00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:28.560]  That to differentiate one of their products, they will actually create a whole new subculture to create that market.
[00:40:29.978 --> 00:40:30.638]  We're good to go.
[00:40:30.658 --> 00:40:30.918]  I think?
[00:40:53.215 --> 00:41:00.058]  Literally put tens of millions of dollars into Marilyn Manson because that was a message they wanted to put out.
[00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:04.399]  And that was a new genre they wanted to push and popularize.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:14.243]  I mean, back in the old days, Marilyn Manson, folks, I have been at a rock concert when nobody knew who Marilyn Manson was about ten years ago.
[00:41:15.043 --> 00:41:20.105]  Last rock concert I ever went to, my cousin said, Hey, I got some tickets to go see this rock concert.
[00:41:20.763 --> 00:41:21.383]  I was like, sure.
[00:41:21.443 --> 00:41:22.724]  I'm like, what's Marilyn Manson?
[00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:24.324]  He goes, oh, some nerd band.
[00:41:24.884 --> 00:41:28.565]  They were playing like number four on the card.
[00:41:31.286 --> 00:41:33.587]  They were just warming up for somebody.
[00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:42.049]  And I walk in there, and there's all these rock and roll people, and Marilyn Manson is up on stage with these cuts all over his body.
[00:41:42.409 --> 00:41:44.369]  I mean, he really is evil, folks.
[00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:46.370]  And I don't mean the guy with the makeup.
[00:41:47.225 --> 00:41:50.767]  Dancing around on stage, you know, that you see today.
[00:41:50.827 --> 00:41:52.148]  I mean, the Marilyn Manson event.
[00:41:52.788 --> 00:41:55.790]  And he's up on stage and he's singing about killing children.
[00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:02.894]  And they've got little toddlers' shirts stapled up on the amplifiers.
[00:42:03.394 --> 00:42:04.474]  And people are booing.
[00:42:04.514 --> 00:42:05.815]  They're throwing things.
[00:42:06.175 --> 00:42:07.236]  People are leaving.
[00:42:07.796 --> 00:42:08.517]  And we left.
[00:42:10.478 --> 00:42:10.918]  We left.
[00:42:13.482 --> 00:42:17.804]  Before you get mad at me for being at some evil rock concert, you've got to remember, I'm 31 now.
[00:42:17.824 --> 00:42:18.885]  I was like 21 then.
[00:42:19.405 --> 00:42:22.106]  I was just then getting involved, waking up.
[00:42:22.126 --> 00:42:24.788]  I think I just started my TV show.
[00:42:26.769 --> 00:42:28.089]  But, you know, we left.
[00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.851]  I was like, man, this is horrible.
[00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:31.731]  Yeah, let's go.
[00:42:31.831 --> 00:42:32.792]  Man, let's get out of here.
[00:42:34.373 --> 00:42:35.713]  And we left.
[00:42:35.873 --> 00:42:38.715]  I mean, it was because he started vomiting on stage.
[00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:40.996]  He was actually having convulsions.
[00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:42.937]  He was like, he weighed about...
[00:42:44.105 --> 00:42:45.406]  No more than 90 pounds.
[00:42:46.446 --> 00:42:48.327]  His stomach was convulsing in and out.
[00:42:48.367 --> 00:42:49.707]  I mean, it was not an act.
[00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.948]  The guy was completely demon-possessed.
[00:42:52.988 --> 00:42:54.549]  And we were there about 10 minutes.
[00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:58.150]  It just got worse and worse, and other people were leaving.
[00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:02.672]  To make a long story short, which you know I can't do, no one wanted that.
[00:43:04.173 --> 00:43:07.414]  No one wanted to see or hear Marilyn Manson.
[00:43:08.394 --> 00:43:23.866]  But Sumner, Redstone, and Viacom sold it to the youth of America and repackaged it because the New World Order thought this was something important that you were supposed to see, that you and I were supposed to enjoy, that you and I were supposed to like.
[00:43:24.587 --> 00:43:26.549]  So many people don't really like something.
[00:43:26.989 --> 00:43:31.292]  They just, because it's trendy, they just go along with it and say they like it.
[00:43:32.794 --> 00:43:35.856]  And then over time, you will actually acquire a taste for something.
[00:43:37.073 --> 00:43:45.016]  And so the New World Order is giving us the acquired taste for death and evil, so we will not follow our instincts to defend ourselves and our family.
[00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.397]  All right, enough said.
[00:43:46.437 --> 00:43:50.178]  See, Kenneth, you sent me off on a jag there, as they say.
[00:43:51.298 --> 00:43:52.599]  Michael in British Columbia.
[00:43:52.639 --> 00:43:53.299]  Go ahead, Michael.
[00:43:53.319 --> 00:43:54.119]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:54.920]  Can you hear me?
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:55.460]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.782]  I'm a first-time caller and a really long-time listener, and I'm happy that I called.
[00:43:59.802 --> 00:44:03.063]  But I just wanted to let you know, like, your podcasts are amazing.
[00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:07.722]  I just download them and I go on amazing hikes and I just get totally informed.
[00:44:07.802 --> 00:44:10.564]  And I'm amazed at the quality of guests you have.
[00:44:10.584 --> 00:44:12.645]  And you don't see that anywhere on television.
[00:44:12.665 --> 00:44:16.508]  You just don't see the variety that you get on your radio show.
[00:44:16.528 --> 00:44:17.509]  And that's really amazing.
[00:44:17.969 --> 00:44:21.792]  Well, we're going to start the vodcasting.
[00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.314]  Really, no one's doing it.
[00:44:24.354 --> 00:44:25.815]  A few big TV shows are.
[00:44:26.582 --> 00:44:31.045]  In about two weeks, we've already redesigned InfoWars, but we haven't launched the redesign.
[00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:32.106]  We're way behind on that.
[00:44:32.586 --> 00:44:35.908]  But after that happens, we're going to launch Vodcasting.
[00:44:36.289 --> 00:44:37.730]  What's that?
[00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:45.155]  We're going to take 15 minutes out of each TV show and make many TV shows.
[00:44:45.515 --> 00:44:47.356]  Well, you know they're coming out with the video pods.
[00:44:47.556 --> 00:44:49.318]  Yeah, they already have that out already.
[00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:51.099]  Yeah, sure.
[00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:53.781]  But by coming out, I mean it's becoming popularized.
[00:44:53.801 --> 00:44:53.901]  Yeah.
[00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:57.526]  And so we're going to start vodcasting.
[00:44:57.626 --> 00:44:58.647]  That's a really good decision.
[00:44:58.987 --> 00:45:11.172]  But what's funny is I'll show a lot of your videos to people in here, and I live in Canada, obviously, but a lot of people just get the information, but they always separate Canada from the U.S., and they just say, like, wow, the U.S.
[00:45:11.252 --> 00:45:12.173]  is really going downhill.
[00:45:12.193 --> 00:45:17.315]  But on our TV, all of our newspapers, all of our news is all exactly the same.
[00:45:17.495 --> 00:45:19.956]  It's just the same message that you get in the States.
[00:45:20.376 --> 00:45:24.058]  It doesn't seem to be an actual difference like most people feel there is.
[00:45:25.977 --> 00:45:26.598]  Oh, exactly.
[00:45:26.638 --> 00:45:31.960]  Look, Europe's like, man, America's horrible, that evil New World Order, and Canada's like, America's horrible, that evil New World Order.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.381]  You were owned and run by the exact same people.
[00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:48.006]  Listen, I call them the echelon group of countries only because in 1954, they set up the echelon system in these five countries, and then I add on to that the fact that
[00:45:49.779 --> 00:45:55.024]  All the exact same programs under the same names or slightly different names.
[00:45:55.665 --> 00:45:59.168]  Here it's Head Start.
[00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:01.270]  In England it's Secure Start.
[00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.392]  Yeah, the point is it's all really just garbage.
[00:46:04.432 --> 00:46:09.217]  Like there's actually no information on the news on any network.
[00:46:09.237 --> 00:46:10.138]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:46:10.198 --> 00:46:10.398]  Like...
[00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:13.312]  And it's amazing that you have your show.
[00:46:13.892 --> 00:46:21.676]  Have you read 1984, where the government is actually reducing the size of the vocabulary and destroying words and changing their meaning?
[00:46:21.936 --> 00:46:24.017]  The government is actively doing that.
[00:46:24.357 --> 00:46:26.798]  Yeah, for sure, and it's becoming really obvious.
[00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:29.620]  No, listen, I'm not sardonic.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:36.923]  Again, I'm not that smart, but I literally talk to people who you cannot have a conversation with, and these are people that are successful in business.
[00:46:36.943 --> 00:46:40.425]  They're like groping, chirping idiots.
[00:46:41.781 --> 00:46:43.963]  Can I just bring up a slightly different point?
[00:46:44.763 --> 00:46:54.050]  All this information, you know, you are talking about a lot of negative things, but you're mostly being negative about the negative things, you know, which is a positive thing.
[00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.651]  Two negatives obviously make a positive thing.
[00:46:55.671 --> 00:47:01.456]  If you've got a giant cyst and it's spreading, say, in your knee, you've got to go have it lanced.
[00:47:01.636 --> 00:47:01.956]  For sure.
[00:47:02.596 --> 00:47:04.678]  And, you know, there's nothing more positive...
[00:47:05.901 --> 00:47:07.042]  I mean, let's get gross here.
[00:47:07.082 --> 00:47:10.043]  We have that instinct to want to get the puss out.
[00:47:10.583 --> 00:47:12.924]  And so we're lancing the wound here.
[00:47:13.344 --> 00:47:14.665]  But I've got to be obvious.
[00:47:14.725 --> 00:47:19.767]  Some of your better shows have always been the ones that just always emphasize the positive.
[00:47:19.827 --> 00:47:23.369]  Because on all of these bad news shows and shitty newspapers...
[00:47:25.456 --> 00:47:30.479]  But a few weeks ago, you were really emphasizing the importance of really living every moment.
[00:47:30.519 --> 00:47:33.660]  No, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:37.202]  It's always nice to talk to folks up in Canada.
[00:47:38.263 --> 00:47:41.344]  Listen, I'm going to try to boil this down for people.
[00:47:42.425 --> 00:47:45.447]  It is positive to tell the truth.
[00:47:46.247 --> 00:47:47.908]  There is nothing more positive.
[00:47:47.928 --> 00:47:52.450]  A few weeks ago, I watched a bunch of preachers on TV when I was on vacation one weekend.
[00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:53.711]  We've already talked about this.
[00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:57.856]  But I haven't really elaborated on it, and I should have because it's important.
[00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:10.581]  And about half these preachers, and I probably watched ten of them, about half these preachers just said, be nothing but positive, ignore the negative, just keep being positive.
[00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:15.323]  And it was really like Anthony Robbins' magical thinking bull.
[00:48:16.821 --> 00:48:21.103]  And that's what God wants, and He doesn't want you to be negative, and God doesn't want you to focus on the bad.
[00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:23.004]  And I was sitting there, I had the Bible open.
[00:48:23.024 --> 00:48:25.185]  There was a Bible in the condo we rented.
[00:48:25.865 --> 00:48:39.752]  And I opened it up, and it was just everything was attack the enemy, attack the evil, resist it, go to war with it, don't trust the government, governments are evil, they're going to run conspiracies on you, they're going to scam you, they want your kids, they want to brainwash you.
[00:48:39.772 --> 00:48:41.373]  I mean, you ought to read it.
[00:48:41.493 --> 00:48:45.255]  I was reading Proverbs and Psalms and Kings and
[00:48:46.583 --> 00:48:47.403]  All these books.
[00:48:48.183 --> 00:48:49.724]  I read the Bible hour after hour.
[00:48:49.764 --> 00:48:50.724]  It was great.
[00:48:51.764 --> 00:48:56.546]  I had some time when the family was asleep to sit up until 1 or 2 in the morning watching TV and reading the Bible.
[00:48:57.186 --> 00:49:02.047]  And what I was reading in the Bible was 180 degrees away from what these preachers were saying.
[00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:06.668]  We got a call yesterday that they're now saying, we all need to take the chip because that proves we love Jesus.
[00:49:07.868 --> 00:49:09.829]  I mean, literally, folks, it's getting to that point.
[00:49:10.433 --> 00:49:14.796]  Pretty soon they'll be dressed up in devil outfits on TV and going, Satan is Jesus or something.
[00:49:15.156 --> 00:49:16.277]  I'm not saying all the preachers.
[00:49:16.297 --> 00:49:17.038]  Some of them were good.
[00:49:17.358 --> 00:49:19.620]  But some, it was just really diabolical.
[00:49:22.922 --> 00:49:27.325]  It is positive to admit where you are in your life.
[00:49:27.445 --> 00:49:30.627]  It is positive to truly assess things first.
[00:49:31.648 --> 00:49:35.291]  And that's how we stop the New World Order is exposure.
[00:49:36.231 --> 00:49:38.113]  And so it's a very positive thing
[00:49:38.914 --> 00:49:43.178]  To be on the air and to be here exposing people.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.122]  I mean, that is extremely positive.
[00:49:48.203 --> 00:49:52.607]  I really can't think of anything that's more positive.
[00:49:52.747 --> 00:49:54.749]  And we are lancing the wound.
[00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:56.531]  That's what we're doing.
[00:49:57.452 --> 00:49:58.593]  And we're going to continue to do it.
[00:49:59.794 --> 00:50:03.157]  And we're going to continue to be a testament.
[00:50:04.617 --> 00:50:09.479]  To show how many prominent people in government know that the government's carrying out terror.
[00:50:09.959 --> 00:50:12.820]  Know that the government's torturing innocent people, much less torturing.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.421]  Know that they're poisoning you through the food and water.
[00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:17.901]  I mean, this is admitted.
[00:50:17.961 --> 00:50:19.742]  This isn't our opinion.
[00:50:21.763 --> 00:50:23.023]  And so that is positive.
[00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:28.745]  I mean, somebody could say, oh, I'm not going to be negative.
[00:50:28.785 --> 00:50:37.992]  I'm just going to sit here in my house, and I'm just going to watch TV, and God's going to bless me, and then magically checks are going to arrive in the mail because I asked God for money.
[00:50:38.012 --> 00:50:40.814]  I mean, that's what these preachers basically are saying.
[00:50:41.454 --> 00:50:42.915]  It's not true.
[00:50:44.036 --> 00:50:44.937]  It's not true.
[00:50:46.858 --> 00:50:50.260]  So, I don't know.
[00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:52.542]  They totally twist everything.
[00:50:53.377 --> 00:50:57.641]  It is extremely positive to expose the oil companies that are running scams.
[00:50:57.881 --> 00:51:00.023]  That way they'll have to stop doing it.
[00:51:02.505 --> 00:51:05.367]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:29.866]  We're talking about... Look, the facts are there.
[00:54:29.926 --> 00:54:30.946]  The truth is out there.
[00:54:30.986 --> 00:54:31.806]  You can find it.
[00:54:32.266 --> 00:54:33.367]  It's demonstrable.
[00:54:34.467 --> 00:54:38.889]  And I cannot stress enough how positive it is to expose criminals.
[00:54:39.989 --> 00:54:41.150]  To expose scams.
[00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:48.834]  Like, oh, we shouldn't be mad that Enron robbed all its employees and stockholders and that they did that.
[00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:52.976]  Let's just be positive and leave them in charge and maybe they'll stop her.
[00:54:53.436 --> 00:55:03.322]  Oh, Hitler, he's doing some bad things, but let's be positive and ignore him and let's not talk bad about the communist Chinese and their mobile execution vans.
[00:55:03.602 --> 00:55:06.504]  Let's be positive and maybe China will reform itself.
[00:55:06.924 --> 00:55:08.625]  And China's only gotten worse, folks.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.502]  All the major human rights groups have done the studies.
[00:55:12.582 --> 00:55:13.523]  It just gets worse and worse.
[00:55:13.563 --> 00:55:20.248]  But, well, we don't call them communists anymore, and we don't call them bad anymore, so they're good now.
[00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:24.191]  And, well, torture's not bad anymore.
[00:55:24.251 --> 00:55:25.192]  Now it's a good thing.
[00:55:25.232 --> 00:55:26.733]  Be positive about the torture.
[00:55:28.515 --> 00:55:31.357]  And, well, the dollar's been devalued, but so what?
[00:55:31.397 --> 00:55:33.658]  And, oh, they're ripping us off at the pump, but so what?
[00:55:33.939 --> 00:55:35.500]  Let's just be positive about it.
[00:55:37.495 --> 00:55:39.716]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Mass.
[00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:40.356]  Dave, go ahead.
[00:55:40.376 --> 00:55:40.957]  Thanks for holding.
[00:55:41.737 --> 00:55:42.458]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[00:55:43.618 --> 00:55:43.898]  Hello?
[00:55:44.218 --> 00:55:44.559]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:45.159 --> 00:55:45.399]  Hi.
[00:55:45.759 --> 00:55:46.940]  It's the first time caller.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:56:03.548]  I'd like to say that it's been a long time living in this world, and I didn't really know, you know, I've always known something was wrong and was, well, let me look at my notes here.
[00:56:04.188 --> 00:56:07.070]  I was, I had a pretty decent job at one time,
[00:56:07.714 --> 00:56:13.415]  And was advancing up the ladder and was given a choice to basically be a crook or leave the company.
[00:56:15.435 --> 00:56:18.676]  And that's happened to me more than once.
[00:56:18.796 --> 00:56:19.996]  It's the culture we live in.
[00:56:20.676 --> 00:56:22.056]  The buck is what's important.
[00:56:23.057 --> 00:56:36.879]  And as far as the globalists, if you read Jefferson's letter, it becomes clear that these globalists, or at least the corporations and concentrations of power mongers, have been around for a long time.
[00:56:37.648 --> 00:56:53.038]  I've watched all of your material, 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, and you've inspired me to write an article for my website, which is not ready to be launched or anything like that, so that's not what this call is about.
[00:56:54.599 --> 00:57:03.765]  The article is about something that I haven't heard on any of your videos, and because of the industry I used to be in,
[00:57:04.727 --> 00:57:08.288]  I'm thinking it's possible that I have a unique take on this.
[00:57:08.628 --> 00:57:09.469]  Well, what is it?
[00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:10.509]  Fill us in on it.
[00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.951]  Well, remember when Ross Perot ran, right?
[00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:16.571]  Yes.
[00:57:17.652 --> 00:57:22.014]  And he got 20% of the votes running on a balanced budget amendment.
[00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:23.014]  Now...
[00:57:24.676 --> 00:57:25.176]  That worked.
[00:57:25.236 --> 00:57:26.758]  We got our balanced budget amendment.
[00:57:27.098 --> 00:57:32.802]  Clinton took credit for it, but it was Ross Perot who gave it to us, running on an independent, non-democratic, non-republican ticket.
[00:57:32.822 --> 00:57:34.503]  But now they just increased the budget.
[00:57:34.543 --> 00:57:35.284]  That was a gimmick.
[00:57:35.824 --> 00:57:44.631]  But, see, there's something that happened before that, is to get around the balanced budget amendment, you have to have a war or a national emergency.
[00:57:46.932 --> 00:57:48.373]  And that's what I think the war is about.
[00:57:48.393 --> 00:57:50.455]  And I don't hear anybody reporting on it, and
[00:57:51.075 --> 00:57:53.797]  You know, I used to be in Wall Street, okay?
[00:57:54.098 --> 00:57:58.321]  Well, they declare a new... There's been a new emergency every year since 1933.
[00:57:59.362 --> 00:57:59.602]  I know.
[00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.503]  I'm listening to them now.
[00:58:00.523 --> 00:58:01.924]  It's the pandemic, I guess.
[00:58:02.765 --> 00:58:07.629]  I heard some... You know, there's so many rumors and so many... So much going around.
[00:58:07.649 --> 00:58:12.013]  And like I said, I operate a website, so I'm... You know, I'm online all the time.
[00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:12.733]  I'm looking at stuff.
[00:58:12.773 --> 00:58:13.774]  Got about 30 seconds.
[00:58:13.834 --> 00:58:14.234]  Go ahead.
[00:58:14.755 --> 00:58:15.095]  Okay.
[00:58:15.496 --> 00:58:19.499]  Well, my point was that I think that this constitutional amendment...
[00:58:20.334 --> 00:58:25.496]  Needs to be looked into because it's our money.
[00:58:26.137 --> 00:58:27.297]  They're throwing it into China.
[00:58:27.357 --> 00:58:28.958]  China, treasury bills.
[00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:33.239]  China buys treasury bills, floods the market with... No, no, no.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.300]  China's being built up.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.521]  We're being shut down.
[00:58:36.561 --> 00:58:37.741]  That's the official plan.
[00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:38.742]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:38.802 --> 00:58:39.742]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:41.363 --> 00:58:45.264]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.604 --> 00:58:46.385]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.621 --> 00:58:58.261]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.922 --> 00:58:59.963]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.683 --> 00:59:01.804]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.465 --> 00:59:03.266]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.026 --> 00:59:05.528]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.588 --> 00:59:09.231]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.772 --> 00:59:13.895]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.096 --> 00:59:19.140]  All right, it's wide open phones, and I only took about five calls in the last hour.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.883]  I'm going to try to not be as long-winded this hour.
[00:59:23.017 --> 00:59:33.845]  We're just going to continually take calls because it's always so informative and interesting, whether it's the upcoming indictment of Scooter Libby, Chief of Staff for the Vice President Dick Cheney, Richard Cheney.
[00:59:34.766 --> 00:59:37.708]  ABC News says that that indictment will be announced today.
[00:59:37.888 --> 00:59:40.190]  We'll see.
[00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.452]  I'm not going to hold my breath, but that's what they're saying.
[00:59:42.472 --> 00:59:50.958]  They're saying it's conclusive, it's going to happen, and that Karl Rove and others may come later, and that Fitzgerald is going to try to expand what he's doing.
[00:59:51.795 --> 00:59:56.317]  I've got a bunch of other news concerning Iran, oil, what's happening with the economy.
[00:59:56.717 --> 00:59:59.898]  We're going to have a smattering of news throughout the broadcast, but mainly your calls.
[01:00:00.338 --> 01:00:13.563]  And we've got a guest coming on in about 15-20 minutes or so, just in the third hour, having one little bit, Ted Pike, because we beat the thought crime, hate crime bill, but they're repackaging it yet again, so we've got to knock this one out.
[01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:20.045]  Yeah, we just had a big 12-rounder with the other one and narrowly beat it, and we've got to fight again.
[01:00:20.856 --> 01:00:22.477]  People say, oh, we've got to fight again.
[01:00:22.517 --> 01:00:23.337]  That's so hard.
[01:00:23.377 --> 01:00:24.117]  We can't do it.
[01:00:24.878 --> 01:00:26.518]  Well, folks, that's what a fight's all about.
[01:00:26.578 --> 01:00:27.979]  This is for all the marbles.
[01:00:28.579 --> 01:00:29.519]  We don't have a choice.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:42.944]  Let's go ahead and go to Daryl in Pennsylvania, because he's at the end of the line, but he goes to the head of the line because he disagrees with me.
[01:00:43.704 --> 01:00:44.565]  Daryl, go ahead.
[01:00:44.585 --> 01:00:45.085]  You're on the air.
[01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.691]  Make one thing clear, Alex.
[01:00:49.531 --> 01:00:51.713]  99.99% of everything, I agree with you 100% down the line.
[01:00:51.753 --> 01:00:54.554]  Well, I don't even agree with myself that much, so boy, that's good.
[01:00:54.975 --> 01:01:02.319]  And I love the heck out of you, and I've always promoted your videos and that, and I still tell people they're the very best to get.
[01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:08.103]  But a couple areas that I think Walt, who called from Michigan the other day, was correct.
[01:01:08.522 --> 01:01:14.683]  We do need to have a more open discussion about Vatican Church, and I want to say one thing right out here.
[01:01:14.723 --> 01:01:15.744]  I'm not anti-Catholic.
[01:01:15.784 --> 01:01:16.664]  My dad's Catholic.
[01:01:16.704 --> 01:01:18.084]  I was married to a Catholic lady.
[01:01:18.664 --> 01:01:20.685]  My best friend in the whole world is Roman Catholic.
[01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:24.505]  About 95% of my relatives are Roman Catholic.
[01:01:25.186 --> 01:01:26.886]  I took catechism courses in Catholic.
[01:01:26.926 --> 01:01:28.646]  I'm not anti-individual Catholic.
[01:01:29.046 --> 01:01:36.168]  But I think when we make a statement, like you do at times and others, when you say it's not the Jews or the Catholics running the New World Order,
[01:01:36.627 --> 01:01:38.008]  I agree with that on the surface.
[01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:41.970]  As far as individual Jews, individual Roman Catholics, yes.
[01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:46.213]  But the Vatican is such a powerhouse, has been such a powerhouse.
[01:01:46.293 --> 01:01:53.097]  Kings bowed to it during much of the Middle Ages, as I'm sure you're well aware of, Alex, because you're a student of history.
[01:01:53.137 --> 01:01:56.119]  But, you know, one of your videos was called Masters of Terror.
[01:01:56.899 --> 01:02:01.882]  And yet, the Vatican Church, the papacy, has been the masters of Mass Murder Incorporated.
[01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:06.652]  They've been the masters of torture incorporated, and you know about the Inquisition, Alex.
[01:02:06.692 --> 01:02:18.260]  But if I can just give you one example, in World War II, to show you how much power the Roman Catholic Church had, it was controlling at least three of the top four intelligence organizations.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:26.026]  You had a Roman Catholic Knight of Malta, German General Reinhard Galen, who was the head of the German intelligence on the Eastern Front.
[01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:29.108]  Of course, after the war, he comes back and helps set up the CIA.
[01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:30.521]  We're good to go.
[01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:06.620]  No, I'm not saying the New World Order doesn't have a lot of control over the Catholic Church, obviously.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.742]  I mean, Pope John Paul II called for a New World Order.
[01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:11.945]  But I would even go further than that, Alex.
[01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.926]  But it's just to sit there.
[01:03:14.447 --> 01:03:18.311]  The point is, if we sit there and say that Catholics are evil... No, I'm not saying that.
[01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:24.637]  There's all these good Catholic people that are out there fighting abortion and a hundred other things that take offense at that, and it's not my...
[01:03:25.357 --> 01:03:27.819]  It's not my job to sit here.
[01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:30.441]  That's all these denominations do is fight with each other.
[01:03:30.461 --> 01:03:38.588]  Right, Alex, but we're talking about the major ecclesiastical tool of the New World Order, and the Catholic Church at the top level is the major tool.
[01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:40.610]  The Pope wants to be at the very head.
[01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.172]  Can I stay over and just give you a couple more quick comments?
[01:03:43.192 --> 01:03:44.393]  Yeah, we've got a lot of other callers.
[01:03:44.413 --> 01:03:47.175]  I want to be fair to them, but I'll give you a little bit more time on the other side.
[01:03:47.195 --> 01:03:50.178]  Now we'll have a big ecclesiastical debate in three hours.
[01:03:54.022 --> 01:03:56.943]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.603 --> 01:03:58.903]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:59.103 --> 01:04:04.845]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:10.366]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:14.827]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:15.007 --> 01:04:18.788]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:19.028 --> 01:04:23.649]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:29.990]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:31.931]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:34.451]  Order 911 The Road to Terry today.

[01:04:48.394 --> 01:04:49.914]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:52.175]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.377 --> 01:05:04.104]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:04.284 --> 01:05:11.769]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.089 --> 01:05:12.569]  Thank you.
[01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.890]  Thank you.
[01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:31.961]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:05:32.001 --> 01:05:33.902]  The water level is always visible.
[01:05:34.062 --> 01:05:40.046]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:40.246 --> 01:05:43.969]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:54.824 --> 01:05:56.426]  Government is best with government.
[01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.288]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:58.728 --> 01:06:01.391]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.534]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.974 --> 01:06:11.421]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:12.402]  We're good to go.
[01:06:32.277 --> 01:06:33.717]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:33.877 --> 01:06:34.238]  Have you?
[01:06:34.818 --> 01:06:36.318]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:06:40.879 --> 01:06:44.520]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.040]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:06:46.581 --> 01:06:47.781]  Osama been forgotten.
[01:06:48.201 --> 01:06:51.962]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:06:52.982 --> 01:06:58.043]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.163 --> 01:07:00.664]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:10.545]  They've got a new thought crime bill that will go out to radio talk show hosts, the internet, free speech.
[01:07:12.546 --> 01:07:15.208]  They can't wait to start arresting people for their speech.
[01:07:17.189 --> 01:07:25.554]  We're also going to get into big rise in profit puts oil giants on defensive because they're running a cartel.
[01:07:25.614 --> 01:07:26.434]  They're colluding.
[01:07:26.954 --> 01:07:27.795]  They're conspiring.
[01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:29.356]  We have their own memos.
[01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:35.923]  And this has been in major newspapers, but people still seem to not be aware of it.
[01:07:37.664 --> 01:07:39.645]  At least the people I hear calling into talk shows.
[01:07:40.605 --> 01:07:51.910]  Also, Negroponte, the guy that literally ran death squads in Latin America and Iraq, is our new domestic head of intelligence, and he's actually hired former head of the Stasi, Marcus Wolff.
[01:07:52.501 --> 01:08:19.817]  And General Primakov of the KGB, that's not a joke, that's serious, to advise him, now announcing the new global and domestic spying operations here in the Washington Post, kind of just an interesting side note, Europe's first pyramid has been discovered in Bosnia, according to the big Bosnian daily newspaper, Dinev Azaz, or Avzaz, but really it's not the first Western Pyramid,
[01:08:20.706 --> 01:08:23.247]  There's pyramids in Rome that the Romans built.
[01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:24.188]  I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:08:24.228 --> 01:08:25.949]  I guess they mean ancient pyramid.
[01:08:26.509 --> 01:08:29.151]  Truly ancient, because this is a 10,000-year-old pyramid.
[01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.091]  It's just kind of weird.
[01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:37.475]  Iran diplomats in Moscow are trying to play down President's harsh statement on Israel about totally destroying it.
[01:08:38.616 --> 01:08:42.138]  And a first Iranian satellite has been launched into space.
[01:08:43.098 --> 01:08:44.579]  That and a lot more.
[01:08:44.639 --> 01:08:50.161]  Pastor Ted Pike coming up with an update on us for us on the hate bill coming up in the next hour.
[01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:52.782]  I want to try to move quicker through your calls here.
[01:08:53.283 --> 01:08:57.745]  Daryl disagrees, and so if you disagree with me, you get to go to the head of the line.
[01:08:58.945 --> 01:09:02.567]  But he's already been on one segment with us, so I'm just going to give him a minute more.
[01:09:03.067 --> 01:09:06.148]  And really, I don't know if we do disagree.
[01:09:07.329 --> 01:09:10.090]  Obviously, the Catholic Church is promoting the New World Order.
[01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:14.068]  But I think that there are a lot of different branches of it.
[01:09:14.488 --> 01:09:18.429]  There are some more socialistic branches, New World Order branches.
[01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:26.430]  There are people in the Catholic Church fighting that as well, but certainly the Vatican itself openly promotes one world government, one world religion.
[01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:30.211]  I mean, I've seen it come out of the Pope's mouth, and I'm not a Catholic.
[01:09:31.071 --> 01:09:38.813]  It's just that, let me tell you something, I don't see Catholics on TBN promoting world government and microchips and
[01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:42.814]  Worshipping George Bush and bombing the Middle East.
[01:09:43.515 --> 01:09:45.057]  I do see Protestants doing it.
[01:09:45.077 --> 01:09:46.499]  Of course, I've been raised a Protestant.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:56.290]  So I just think, period, the New World Order, governments themselves, they're going in, taking over churches, just lock, stock, and barrels.
[01:09:56.611 --> 01:09:58.253]  I really don't know what the disagreement is
[01:09:59.735 --> 01:10:08.580]  If I have a guest who's basically saying that the Catholics themselves are just evil, I'm going to say, well, there's evil people in high places.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.041]  Because I know a lot of Catholic people.
[01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:11.782]  They're good folks.
[01:10:12.502 --> 01:10:15.384]  And again, I don't want to have some three-hour debate about Catholics, folks.
[01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:16.064]  I really don't.
[01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:16.965]  You're welcome.
[01:10:16.985 --> 01:10:17.805]  We don't screen the calls.
[01:10:17.825 --> 01:10:20.287]  You're welcome to talk about Catholics all day if you want to.
[01:10:20.987 --> 01:10:23.449]  But Daryl, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:28.552]  Alex, and I don't want your show ever to disintegrate into an ecclesiastical, doctrinal...
[01:10:29.187 --> 01:10:39.375]  ...type debate, and it's not about Catholics, because most individual Catholics are like most individual Jews at the lower levels, most individual Masons, most individual lower-level Jesuits.
[01:10:39.475 --> 01:10:41.657]  They've got no idea what's going on at the top.
[01:10:41.697 --> 01:10:48.202]  But the key fact that we're talking about is Murder Incorporated, and Walt brought up the point of the Vatican's Holocaust...
[01:10:48.786 --> 01:11:10.418]  Alex, the religious genocide that took place in the 1940s, just a few years before I was born, where they impelled small children on stakes, crucified Orthodox priests to wooden doors, led on and choreographed and orchestrated by the Franciscan monks, priests, and friars, led the Roman Catholic Ustashi Militia, which is called Catholic Action Militia,
[01:11:10.874 --> 01:11:14.657]  Much like what the Knights of Columbus have set up in the United States to do.
[01:11:14.677 --> 01:11:16.958]  But let me give you a couple quick quotes, very short ones.
[01:11:17.299 --> 01:11:22.222]  Marquis de Lafayette said that the Jesuits have instigated most of the wars of Europe.
[01:11:22.943 --> 01:11:33.670]  Edmund Parris, a famous author of the book Secret History of the Jesuits, the public is practically unaware of the overwhelming responsibility carried by the Vatican and its Jesuits in the starting of two world wars.
[01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:40.495]  A situation which may be explained in part by the gigantic finances at the disposition of the Vatican and its Jesuits.
[01:11:40.854 --> 01:11:44.516]  And the last quote, Alex, is from a famous Canadian historian, J.E.C.
[01:11:44.556 --> 01:12:00.727]  Shepard, said, Between 1555 and 1931, the Society of Jesus, that's the Jesuit order, was expelled from at least 83 countries, cities, states, and cities for engaging in political intrigue and subversive plot against the welfare of the state.
[01:12:00.827 --> 01:12:09.172]  Alex, they were thrown out mostly by Roman Catholic monarchs, three times, I believe, out of France, three times out of Spain, three times out of Portugal, or at least right in that ballpark.
[01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:13.842]  These Catholic Monarchs kept throwing these people out, and where did they come and take up residence?
[01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:21.688]  In England, and in the United States, and the Jesuits control Georgetown University and a lot of other big universities in the United States.
[01:12:21.728 --> 01:12:24.371]  They've got tremendous influence in the CFR.
[01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:30.615]  Their guy named Walsh, a priest, helped set up for the Department of State there.
[01:12:30.675 --> 01:12:34.238]  I'm trying to think of the school down there that trains diplomats and everything.
[01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:37.641]  My point, Alex, is that any place the Jesuits have been
[01:12:38.556 --> 01:12:40.478]  And they control the Knights of Malta, by the way.
[01:12:40.678 --> 01:12:42.539]  And they control the top levels of Freemasonry.
[01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:46.843]  You said about that you don't hear Catholics on TV condemning the New World Order.
[01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:47.624]  They don't have to.
[01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.865]  They control the top levels of Freemasonry.
[01:12:49.925 --> 01:12:51.787]  So, Alex, I'm scared to death.
[01:12:51.827 --> 01:12:52.728]  I'm telling you the truth.
[01:12:52.788 --> 01:12:56.391]  Not for myself, but for the children, our grandchildren in this country.
[01:12:57.352 --> 01:12:57.832]  Okay.
[01:12:57.932 --> 01:13:01.935]  I gave you the floor, and I appreciate your call, Darrell.
[01:13:02.736 --> 01:13:05.638]  I mean, you're just... I can hear the emotion.
[01:13:05.699 --> 01:13:07.420]  I can hear that you're scared and you're upset.
[01:13:10.589 --> 01:13:16.975]  I just look at this, and I know for a fact that it was the Rothschilds that funded World War I and World War II.
[01:13:17.576 --> 01:13:20.879]  And then I know we're going to hear that the Rothschilds are really Catholic.
[01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:24.782]  They're Luciferian, folks.
[01:13:25.062 --> 01:13:28.005]  That group has been taking over all these organizations.
[01:13:28.045 --> 01:13:32.329]  So, of course, you've got the New World Order controlling the Catholic Church.
[01:13:32.389 --> 01:13:35.252]  I mean, there are hundreds of Catholic publications I've read.
[01:13:36.764 --> 01:13:38.825]  Decrying the corruption coming out of Rome.
[01:13:39.366 --> 01:13:41.347]  Look, you don't have any argument here with me.
[01:13:41.367 --> 01:13:52.194]  I mean, back in the 80s, we had the CIA director meeting routinely with Pope John Paul II and little secret confabs cloistered in there, sneaking around.
[01:13:52.214 --> 01:14:00.319]  I mean, I know there's all sorts of stuff going on, but the New World Order uses any organization it can to run these operations.
[01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:03.381]  And I just, everybody gets caught up in the debate
[01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:07.792]  Of exactly who's got the most power inside the New World Order.
[01:14:08.892 --> 01:14:14.636]  And I guess that's healthier than believing George Bush actually runs something, or Bill Clinton runs something.
[01:14:16.337 --> 01:14:24.021]  To me, that's the ultimate distraction, and we're all just perseverating on George Bush, and oh, he may go to jail, or oh, he may have to resign.
[01:14:24.121 --> 01:14:24.861]  Ha ha!
[01:14:25.382 --> 01:14:27.843]  There may be indictments, Fitzgerald.
[01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:29.744]  I mean, none of it means anything.
[01:14:29.804 --> 01:14:32.666]  It's nothing but a grand, diversionary spectacle.
[01:14:32.726 --> 01:14:32.826]  So,
[01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:37.161]  I mean, I think it's good to have these discussions about who's got the power.
[01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:40.966]  Sir, I know a lot about the Jesuits, only because I...
[01:14:42.262 --> 01:14:45.323]  In my off time, I've read a lot of naval histories.
[01:14:45.343 --> 01:14:59.427]  For some reason, I one time read a naval history book and then I ended up reading some fiction and non-fiction and the history of early circumnavigation and obviously the Jesuits in Portugal and the rudders.
[01:14:59.808 --> 01:15:07.270]  The rudders were the little maps of where to go and secret maps of different tides and different channels and different...
[01:15:08.826 --> 01:15:11.427]  Different shipping lanes and how to travel around the world.
[01:15:11.867 --> 01:15:24.273]  So the Jesuits did get enormous power because they were the missionaries in the front-line vanguard, really a military order at that time, all over the planet, from China to Japan to Latin America.
[01:15:24.794 --> 01:15:28.395]  So I mean, absolutely, a lot of power, a lot of control.
[01:15:30.256 --> 01:15:31.017]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:15:31.037 --> 01:15:38.060]  I mean, at the top of the New World Order, you've got Protestants, you've got Catholics, you've got Jews, you've got everything, and they're just New World Order.
[01:15:38.777 --> 01:15:44.738]  And they hope that we'll all just sit here and talk about which group's dominant while they're playing us off against each other.
[01:15:44.778 --> 01:15:45.998]  It's like French dolls.
[01:15:47.058 --> 01:15:47.939]  Or Russian dolls.
[01:15:48.459 --> 01:15:53.880]  You got one little bitty one the size of a pea, and a little bit bigger one goes over that, and a little bit bigger one over that.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.500]  That's what my studies have shown me.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:04.621]  And I don't know how to... I mean, we can just talk about it all day long.
[01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:07.442]  See, that's how one call can just take us in a direction.
[01:16:07.622 --> 01:16:08.242]  And that's fine.
[01:16:08.795 --> 01:16:10.817]  But I'm really going to try to take your calls quickly now.
[01:16:11.417 --> 01:16:15.140]  I guess up next is Bart, and Bart's calling from Houston.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.740]  Welcome, Bart.
[01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:16.561]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:16.581 --> 01:16:19.363]  Well, you know, it's called not being able to see the forest for the trees.
[01:16:19.423 --> 01:16:22.085]  The idea is we have to engage the New World Order.
[01:16:22.105 --> 01:16:25.228]  We can't spend all of our time simply talking about the New World Order.
[01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:26.409]  That's its own mind trap.
[01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.070]  That's not the reason I called.
[01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:35.796]  The reason I called is, you know, Ted Pike's on today, and the bills that he's going to inform the listening audience about are very important, but
[01:16:36.246 --> 01:16:46.833]  You know, currently there are bills before the House and the Senate that are going to eliminate the franchising fees for all PEGs that supply public access channels across the country.
[01:16:46.873 --> 01:17:00.442]  And they're also moving to restrict the Internet and not repair the switching grids and basically have the Internet fail and force us on the Internet, too, where they'll charge you, tax you, track you, and restrict you.
[01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:02.564]  But here's a point to that.
[01:17:03.384 --> 01:17:04.305]  In every city...
[01:17:04.827 --> 01:17:22.658]  If one single person in your listening audience will really become an activist and get involved, and I can speak to this personally from my own experiences defending public access in Houston, you can shift an entire campaign, you can shift an entire agenda of an assault on any issue
[01:17:23.217 --> 01:17:31.180]  If you get out there, and you call into radio shows, and you build a website, and you have a platform, and you're motivated... Have you saved AXS TV in Houston?
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.741]  We're fighting it, and right now we're waiting for the next vote by the mayor.
[01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:42.784]  Everything's looking pretty positive, and you know, I would like your listeners, because now the website is not simply focused on... Is it currently open?
[01:17:43.345 --> 01:17:44.005]  Yes, yes.
[01:17:44.265 --> 01:17:45.685]  Houston Media Source is open.
[01:17:45.705 --> 01:17:49.567]  They're keeping it operating until the next vote, which is coming up in about two weeks.
[01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:54.639]  Well, I know you guys have been airing my documentaries down there for years.
[01:17:54.679 --> 01:17:57.260]  Well, you know, everyone down here, they want the new ones, Alex.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:04.783]  I'm trying to transfer copies off the Internet so that I can put them on tape and play them up there, but they've all been...
[01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:11.080]  Been complaining to me, you know, Eric, the programming manager who I think you've met, was saying he doesn't send us any new tapes anymore.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.120]  They've been wanting new tapes.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.661]  Yeah, well, I can't do it all, so... No, no, I know.
[01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:18.142]  I'm fighting the battle on that, and I'm going to try... Well, give us your website.
[01:18:18.362 --> 01:18:28.844]  Okay, the website is www.amendment-one.org, and that has all the links on these bills and how to fight them to save public access.
[01:18:28.864 --> 01:18:30.804]  So everybody out there, please get involved.
[01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:32.985]  Stop listening and start acting.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.262]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:18:35.863 --> 01:18:41.971]  At every level, our avenues for free speech are being shut off because we're hurting them bad.
[01:18:42.031 --> 01:18:46.757]  I mean, they've got to move against the First Amendment, which is really going to wake people up.
[01:18:46.877 --> 01:18:49.220]  But it's really happening.
[01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:50.983]  They're really going after it.
[01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:55.018]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:18:55.178 --> 01:18:56.299]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:59.922]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:00.022 --> 01:19:00.423]  Phenol.
[01:19:00.763 --> 01:19:07.890]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:12.314]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:12.835]  Fragrance?
[01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:17.979]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:22.804]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:25.586]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:19:25.826 --> 01:19:29.250]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Peirceau Company, it's all natural.
[01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.993]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:19:55.436 --> 01:19:56.477]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.798 --> 01:19:59.581]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:04.007]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.447 --> 01:20:05.269]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.589 --> 01:20:10.155]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.635 --> 01:20:12.756]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:13.256 --> 01:20:27.940]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:35.042]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:20:42.385 --> 01:20:43.085]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:43.165 --> 01:20:44.545]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:20:44.565 --> 01:20:45.526]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:45.546 --> 01:20:45.986]  One and the same.
[01:21:03.078 --> 01:21:07.059]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:07.079 --> 01:21:09.140]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:09.660]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.201]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:11.501 --> 01:21:11.941]  Here is reality.
[01:21:11.961 --> 01:21:14.002]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:28.843 --> 01:21:29.203]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:21:53.248 --> 01:21:56.871]  Attention drivers, poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:21:57.191 --> 01:22:00.493]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:22:00.813 --> 01:22:05.677]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:22:06.037 --> 01:22:09.700]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.500]  Go to www.sfr.com
[01:22:39.261 --> 01:22:42.303]  That's S-F-R-C-O-R-P dot com or call 888-USE-S-F-R-1 That's 888-873-7371
[01:22:56.255 --> 01:22:56.695]  Don't worry.
[01:22:57.236 --> 01:22:58.717]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.257 --> 01:23:02.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:05.923]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:10.606]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:23:11.026 --> 01:23:15.290]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:17.712]  The ring of fire.
[01:23:18.272 --> 01:23:20.594]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:23:24.227 --> 01:23:25.628]  When is that coming out?
[01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:31.273]  The taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet.
[01:23:31.753 --> 01:23:34.015]  I fell for you like a child.
[01:23:34.695 --> 01:23:36.817]  Oh, but the fire went wild.
[01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:43.082]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Kim and then Johanna and Paula and Tim and many others.
[01:23:43.122 --> 01:23:44.082]  Go ahead, Kim.
[01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:48.206]  They indicted Libby.
[01:23:48.226 --> 01:23:49.767]  He's been charged.
[01:23:49.787 --> 01:23:51.288]  He's also resigned already.
[01:23:52.088 --> 01:23:56.949]  And Fitzpatrick, I mean Fitzgerald's going to speak at 1 o'clock today, our time, central time.
[01:23:58.089 --> 01:24:04.751]  Well, I'm sure most of our stations will be tuning over to carry that, but I mean, it's a foregone conclusion.
[01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:07.511]  I guess ABC News was right early this morning.
[01:24:08.171 --> 01:24:14.273]  They had it up there that he would be indicted later today, and so this just happened, and he's already resigned.
[01:24:14.293 --> 01:24:14.753]  Uh-huh.
[01:24:15.853 --> 01:24:20.454]  Are they going to clap him in irons, or does he have to go get booked, or does he... No, he drove away.
[01:24:22.085 --> 01:24:23.666]  Oh, so he just went in and got indicted?
[01:24:24.467 --> 01:24:25.147]  I guess so.
[01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.909]  I mean, they didn't show where he was when he was indicted.
[01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:35.254]  Well, I guess the smoking gun later today, smokinggun.com, I guess it'll have the mugshot of Scooter Libby.
[01:24:37.116 --> 01:24:38.577]  But now, what is the distraction?
[01:24:38.637 --> 01:24:45.722]  Some like you, there's Myers being put up where the Supreme Court and
[01:24:46.485 --> 01:24:53.631]  This indictment and all this is a smokescreen, but it has to be something really major to take these type of people out of the White House.
[01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:54.572]  Well, understand this.
[01:24:54.892 --> 01:25:00.897]  All of this indictment business, the Myers business, I mean, the indictments really are a distraction.
[01:25:01.137 --> 01:25:04.240]  From the globalist view, for Bush, believe me, Bush doesn't like it.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.981]  Bush isn't in the loop or part of this.
[01:25:06.642 --> 01:25:08.984]  But higher up, the globalists love to...
[01:25:09.799 --> 01:25:12.761]  Have presidents destroyed and rise and fall.
[01:25:13.201 --> 01:25:16.443]  That gives the masses kind of the bread and circus they need.
[01:25:17.264 --> 01:25:19.966]  They know the masses love to see Hollywood people go down.
[01:25:20.026 --> 01:25:22.988]  We love to see leaders go down.
[01:25:23.048 --> 01:25:26.270]  But then we never even know the names of the controllers.
[01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:35.836]  The Oppenheimers, the Rothmans, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Saxo-Berg-Gothas, people like Juan Carlos of Spain.
[01:25:35.856 --> 01:25:37.517]  I mean, they're the big hitters.
[01:25:37.557 --> 01:25:38.118]  They really own it.
[01:25:39.085 --> 01:25:44.868]  They just indicted him on perjury, obstruction of justice, and false basements.
[01:25:45.428 --> 01:25:47.229]  Nothing about the leak, the actual leak.
[01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:54.713]  Well, that's what they've been saying for weeks, and that's what they are reporting is that they are going to indict him for perjury.
[01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:57.254]  But I don't understand one without the other.
[01:25:57.274 --> 01:25:58.734]  I mean, he's lying about lying.
[01:25:59.875 --> 01:26:00.295]  You know?
[01:26:01.776 --> 01:26:05.858]  Well, listen, that's why, whether you're innocent or guilty or...
[01:26:06.658 --> 01:26:10.399]  Whether they're doing something to you that you don't think should be illegal, whatever.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:12.300]  Never talk.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.861]  There's a reason we got a Fifth Amendment.
[01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:17.222]  I mean, if you get arrested, folks, listen to me.
[01:26:17.722 --> 01:26:19.623]  Do not talk.
[01:26:20.923 --> 01:26:25.365]  You know, when the friendly cop comes in your cell or the friendly FBI agent, come on, let's talk.
[01:26:25.385 --> 01:26:26.245]  I want to get you out of here.
[01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:27.146]  I want to be your friend.
[01:26:27.786 --> 01:26:28.726]  It's bull.
[01:26:29.207 --> 01:26:30.987]  And you don't even have to lie to them.
[01:26:31.027 --> 01:26:32.488]  They can just say you lied to them.
[01:26:32.768 --> 01:26:35.269]  So all you do is keep your mouth shut.
[01:26:36.013 --> 01:26:36.773]  Exactly.
[01:26:36.793 --> 01:26:38.314]  I tell people that all the time.
[01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:43.217]  My mom had an incident where she didn't know the IRS was coming to her door, and she invited them in.
[01:26:43.237 --> 01:26:44.978]  I said, why did you do that?
[01:26:46.019 --> 01:26:50.361]  You know, being 68 and old, and she was like, well, I just let them in.
[01:26:50.421 --> 01:26:51.182]  I don't know.
[01:26:51.222 --> 01:26:54.023]  And I'm like, you did not have to let them in.
[01:26:54.063 --> 01:26:55.504]  They could have spoken to you on the porch.
[01:26:55.624 --> 01:26:59.066]  And by the way, they don't respect that or appreciate it.
[01:26:59.733 --> 01:27:01.574]  You know, I'm telling her that case in your house, it seems...
[01:27:30.003 --> 01:27:31.544]  Exactly your standard of living.
[01:27:32.305 --> 01:27:36.207]  You know, why can't you pay your taxes if you're living so well, supposedly, you know?
[01:27:36.727 --> 01:27:39.689]  I'm thinking that she has a... My dad's a stroke patient.
[01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:46.634]  You know, we take care of him every day, and they're not looking at that, but they're just looking at how nice they kept the house and how long they've kept it, you know?
[01:27:47.434 --> 01:27:48.835]  Well, they're looking at the equity.
[01:27:49.155 --> 01:27:50.016]  Right, right.
[01:27:50.116 --> 01:27:51.657]  And that's what I tried to explain to her.
[01:27:53.098 --> 01:27:54.679]  Well, listen, period.
[01:27:54.699 --> 01:27:56.800]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.781]  In a free country...
[01:27:58.743 --> 01:28:01.065]  The government cannot take your house for taxes.
[01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:05.588]  I mean, no one ever put up with that in this country until the last 50 years.
[01:28:05.968 --> 01:28:11.152]  If you told somebody 50 years ago, the government's going to take your house, they would laugh at you.
[01:28:13.534 --> 01:28:13.894]  Never.
[01:28:14.575 --> 01:28:16.536]  Taxes were a pittance in this country.
[01:28:18.398 --> 01:28:19.218]  They were a pittance.
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:25.303]  Now, I'll never forget Nella Wells Spears, our county tax assessor,
[01:28:26.494 --> 01:28:33.399]  We've gone and protested the auctions, where they're auctioning off hundreds of middle-class and blue-collar homes and businesses.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:38.442]  And then the woman, I confronted her, she said, we don't auction houses, we don't take houses.
[01:28:38.462 --> 01:28:40.984]  I mean, these people are just the biggest liars.
[01:28:43.806 --> 01:28:44.727]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.207 --> 01:28:46.808]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.729 --> 01:28:50.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.322]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.542 --> 01:29:05.543]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.883 --> 01:29:13.785]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.925 --> 01:29:20.987]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.067 --> 01:29:21.788]  And is very easy to use.
[01:29:21.808 --> 01:29:23.490]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:38.467 --> 01:29:41.408]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.428 --> 01:29:41.468]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.488 --> 01:29:42.429]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.251 --> 01:30:01.513]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.773 --> 01:30:06.114]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.415 --> 01:30:15.317]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.537 --> 01:30:19.138]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.438 --> 01:30:24.483]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.783 --> 01:30:31.470]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:31.986 --> 01:30:32.647]  What about you?
[01:30:33.287 --> 01:30:38.631]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:38.691 --> 01:30:39.711]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:39.871 --> 01:30:41.753]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.459 --> 01:30:57.362]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:30:57.482 --> 01:30:59.243]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:30:59.303 --> 01:31:00.564]  But not just any water.
[01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:04.867]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:31:04.927 --> 01:31:14.633]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[01:31:14.793 --> 01:31:15.514]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:31.031]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:31.351]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:32:02.691 --> 01:32:11.056]  ...top age, chief of staff, five counts indicted for perjury and obstruction.
[01:32:13.818 --> 01:32:14.679]  And that is a big deal.
[01:32:14.719 --> 01:32:19.762]  I mean, when the vice president's chief of staff gets indicted, that is big news.
[01:32:20.602 --> 01:32:22.123]  Any way you slice it or cut it.
[01:32:22.944 --> 01:32:30.869]  Karl Rove, or Turd Blossom, and I'm sorry to use that term, but I mean, if the Christian conservative president...
[01:32:31.483 --> 01:32:34.205]  Has a different feces name for each one of his age.
[01:32:34.666 --> 01:32:35.987]  You know, maybe it's good.
[01:32:36.007 --> 01:32:39.650]  I mean, perhaps flipping people off is good.
[01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:41.491]  Perhaps cussing and screaming is good.
[01:32:41.892 --> 01:32:46.555]  I mean, Bush does it, and he's this disciple of Jesus who we're supposed to worship.
[01:32:46.595 --> 01:32:48.837]  Maybe... No, the answer is no.
[01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:55.322]  It's not okay to talk like that, and it's not okay to flip people off and scream at your staff and trough around.
[01:32:56.283 --> 01:33:00.867]  But I wonder if the blossom, the awesome blossom...
[01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:06.004]  Is going to get in trouble himself.
[01:33:07.244 --> 01:33:10.785]  Why has Libby been indicted for lying?
[01:33:12.245 --> 01:33:15.386]  Why did Bill Clinton get called before a grand jury for lying?
[01:33:17.346 --> 01:33:18.767]  This is unbelievable.
[01:33:19.187 --> 01:33:21.907]  They commit literally thousands of crimes.
[01:33:22.107 --> 01:33:28.989]  Communist generals in the Commerce Department with thousands of faxes and emails of all the classified data.
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.842]  Supercomputers to North Korea and China.
[01:33:32.862 --> 01:33:34.864]  I misspoke.
[01:33:34.964 --> 01:33:36.345]  Supercomputers to China.
[01:33:38.047 --> 01:33:43.892]  Nuclear reactors and missile secrets to North Korea.
[01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.955]  Biological weapons to Saddam.
[01:33:46.975 --> 01:33:48.256]  I'm talking about Rumsfeld right now.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:56.682]  Just constant profiteering, personally giving contracts to companies they have massive stock in.
[01:33:57.202 --> 01:33:59.723]  Total felonies, just no debating it.
[01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:03.184]  Every action they've made, just slam dunk.
[01:34:04.585 --> 01:34:11.387]  It's like catching, it's like the police pull up and they catch you in the black mask right after you shoot.
[01:34:12.517 --> 01:34:20.138]  The clerk and the police pull up while your own surveillance camera, cramming money in the bag, and then they shoot you.
[01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:22.219]  I mean, it's that slammed up.
[01:34:23.139 --> 01:34:32.301]  Every time they give some multi-billion dollar contract to Lockheed Martin while Dick Cheney's wife is on the board, it's totally illegal.
[01:34:36.041 --> 01:34:39.322]  Every time they give huge contracts to the Carlaw Group, it is illegal.
[01:34:41.061 --> 01:34:42.001]  They never get in trouble.
[01:34:42.782 --> 01:34:55.708]  Do you understand that Secretary of the Army White, before he had to leave because he said we needed 400,000 troops, I mean, even their little crime buddies get fired when they don't just tell Bush that, you know, the sky is green when it's really blue.
[01:34:57.129 --> 01:34:59.330]  But that guy actually led people on tours.
[01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:02.011]  The California legislature with U.S.
[01:35:02.051 --> 01:35:06.293]  congressmen and women in California into a fake computer room.
[01:35:06.393 --> 01:35:09.695]  A fake... Do you understand how fake these people are, folks?
[01:35:10.453 --> 01:35:11.955]  What an illusion it all is.
[01:35:12.235 --> 01:35:20.926]  They actually have fake trading rooms, you know, with the big computer plasma screens, and, oh, there's the real-time trading and energy and power right now.
[01:35:21.935 --> 01:35:22.615]  We're good to go.
[01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:42.482]  That it's in short supply.
[01:35:42.522 --> 01:35:44.062]  Then people will accept higher prices.
[01:35:44.463 --> 01:35:54.307]  I mean, we've caught the oil companies openly with their memos where they said we're going to shut down refineries and buy up our competition and artificially create a loggerhead.
[01:35:55.148 --> 01:35:56.388]  They should all go to prison.
[01:35:56.688 --> 01:36:01.471]  It's just all red-handed smoking gun crime everywhere.
[01:36:03.031 --> 01:36:05.332]  And what are they now getting in trouble for?
[01:36:05.633 --> 01:36:08.434]  And I don't want to hear they got Capone with income tax.
[01:36:09.938 --> 01:36:10.438]  We're good to go.
[01:36:29.774 --> 01:36:33.215]  If they go after Brownie or Poopy or any of his... That's their names, folks.
[01:36:33.495 --> 01:36:48.018]  If they go after any of them, Poopy or Turd Blossom or Dookie or any of his staff, then everybody's going to get in trouble because it's connected to all these big corporations and all these big interests.
[01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:50.418]  And if you don't like hearing me talk like that, I'm sorry, folks.
[01:36:50.478 --> 01:36:51.599]  It's our president talks.
[01:36:51.959 --> 01:36:52.919]  It's presidential.
[01:36:54.319 --> 01:36:55.579]  So I should be president now.
[01:36:55.599 --> 01:36:57.360]  It's a prerequisite.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.600]  Now, I don't use cocaine.
[01:36:59.545 --> 01:37:04.550]  And I don't drink heavily, and I don't sleep three hours a day.
[01:37:05.531 --> 01:37:10.056]  I really am not qualified, so I apologize for ever trying to toot my own horn.
[01:37:10.396 --> 01:37:12.419]  Okay.
[01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:14.561]  A little attempt at humor, folks.
[01:37:14.601 --> 01:37:15.081]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:15.141 --> 01:37:16.102]  I just can't get over it.
[01:37:16.403 --> 01:37:17.304]  We have a president.
[01:37:18.965 --> 01:37:19.406]  Never mind.
[01:37:19.806 --> 01:37:20.407]  I've said enough.
[01:37:22.321 --> 01:37:23.261]  Forget all that.
[01:37:23.521 --> 01:37:28.542]  The guy's got gay porn stars coming to the White House over 50 times after midnight.
[01:37:28.602 --> 01:37:30.883]  I mean, two plus two equals four, folks.
[01:37:31.383 --> 01:37:33.203]  This is just getting crazier and crazier.
[01:37:33.804 --> 01:37:37.844]  Let's go ahead and... Really, I'm living in the twilight zone.
[01:37:38.525 --> 01:37:39.685]  Let's talk to Johanna.
[01:37:39.885 --> 01:37:41.785]  Johanna's calling from Tejas as well.
[01:37:42.165 --> 01:37:43.006]  Johanna, welcome.
[01:37:43.366 --> 01:37:43.746]  Welcome.
[01:37:43.826 --> 01:37:45.666]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:37:47.226 --> 01:37:49.667]  It is very important for us to understand the depth
[01:37:50.599 --> 01:37:52.901]  Of what is really going on and why it's happening.
[01:37:53.962 --> 01:37:59.026]  The scriptures warn us, well inform us first, telling us that there was war in heaven first.
[01:37:59.827 --> 01:38:02.409]  People don't understand that, but it says it right here in Revelation 12.
[01:38:04.871 --> 01:38:10.415]  And the devil, along with his demons, fought against the holy angels.
[01:38:11.555 --> 01:38:13.476]  But they left through the blood of our Savior.
[01:38:13.736 --> 01:38:16.358]  And that's when... Ma'am, talk right into your phone for me.
[01:38:16.398 --> 01:38:18.038]  I'm just so tired of bad phones.
[01:38:18.399 --> 01:38:24.041]  I want to hear what you have to say, but it's like our listeners must have the worst telephones on the planet.
[01:38:24.562 --> 01:38:25.282]  Can you hear me now?
[01:38:25.642 --> 01:38:28.123]  Yeah, it just sounds like you're 14 feet away.
[01:38:28.143 --> 01:38:29.264]  You know, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:29.304 --> 01:38:30.424]  Just knock yourself out.
[01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.625]  Can you hear me now?
[01:38:33.086 --> 01:38:33.766]  Yeah, sure.
[01:38:33.786 --> 01:38:34.967]  All right, thank you.
[01:38:35.107 --> 01:38:35.547]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:35.867 --> 01:38:37.128]  No, it's not that bad.
[01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:38.268]  I just don't understand it.
[01:38:38.908 --> 01:38:39.829]  I'll try to talk louder.
[01:38:40.698 --> 01:38:51.920]  I was saying, it is important for us to know the depth of what's really happening, because as you've spoken about how they've changed characters, well, the devil's the one behind everything that's going on.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.122]  The New World Order, even the Roman Catholic Church, like that young man was speaking about earlier.
[01:38:58.162 --> 01:39:02.583]  And, you know, the devil's plan is all around us.
[01:39:02.723 --> 01:39:03.803]  It's right in clear view.
[01:39:03.943 --> 01:39:08.164]  It's just that he realizes he's deceiving the world, and people don't know.
[01:39:08.871 --> 01:39:11.592]  What is really going on and how he is deceiving the world.
[01:39:11.652 --> 01:39:15.533]  But if you look on the dollar bill, it's very clear.
[01:39:15.553 --> 01:39:26.476]  If you look under the image of the eagle on the back of the one dollar bill, where it shows the lines in the shield, the vertical lines.
[01:39:26.496 --> 01:39:29.237]  If you count those lines, they're very fine.
[01:39:29.257 --> 01:39:31.977]  But if you count them, you'll see there are 13 lines.
[01:39:32.998 --> 01:39:33.978]  And the vertical lines
[01:39:34.871 --> 01:39:36.792]  Yeah, there's 13 all over it.
[01:39:36.832 --> 01:39:37.452]  That's admitted.
[01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:40.013]  13 stars, 13 arrows.
[01:39:40.554 --> 01:39:41.714]  Oh, there's not 13?
[01:39:41.854 --> 01:39:42.274]  Okay.
[01:39:42.734 --> 01:39:46.996]  No, what I'm saying is the vertical lines underneath the 13 lines are 18.
[01:39:47.576 --> 01:39:51.998]  And it coincides with Revelation chapter 13, verse 18.
[01:39:52.579 --> 01:40:00.562]  The plan, and not only that, the stars above the seal, the eagle, are... They form the...
[01:40:01.377 --> 01:40:05.318]  The flag, the star of Israel, which is the six-pointed star.
[01:40:05.538 --> 01:40:05.818]  Yes.
[01:40:06.038 --> 01:40:07.799]  That is the devil's mark.
[01:40:07.839 --> 01:40:09.319]  Well, it's the seal of Solomon.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.360]  Thanks for the call.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.380]  No, it's... It's not.
[01:40:13.761 --> 01:40:14.821]  Let me just tell you something, folks.
[01:40:14.841 --> 01:40:21.303]  We could spend all day getting into the symbolism on the money and the symbolism all over architecture.
[01:40:21.383 --> 01:40:22.744]  I mean, my new video is about that.
[01:40:23.344 --> 01:40:24.564]  And yes, it is true.
[01:40:24.604 --> 01:40:25.685]  There is symbolism.
[01:40:25.725 --> 01:40:26.825]  There is numerology.
[01:40:27.786 --> 01:40:29.847]  That's what the higher-level Masons are into.
[01:40:29.967 --> 01:40:30.667]  That's admitted.
[01:40:30.707 --> 01:40:34.649]  I mean, they even have shows on the Discovery Channel about the symbolism and the money.
[01:40:35.269 --> 01:40:36.450]  And so, yes, it's true.
[01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:44.473]  But to say because there's 18 lines and 13 stripes that it's the revelation, I think that's a stretch.
[01:40:44.993 --> 01:40:46.334]  I'm not going to argue it with you.
[01:40:46.354 --> 01:40:47.134]  Maybe it's true.
[01:40:47.154 --> 01:40:49.735]  I know this.
[01:40:49.775 --> 01:40:53.897]  The globalists are totally obsessed with numerology.
[01:40:53.937 --> 01:40:57.018]  They are totally obsessed with numbers.
[01:40:58.092 --> 01:40:59.493]  You know, maybe it's my headset.
[01:40:59.533 --> 01:41:00.694]  Maybe it's the audio I'm getting.
[01:41:00.714 --> 01:41:06.878]  It's just lately, the phones, it's like the audio's low, and it's like they're at a distance, and it just sounds.
[01:41:07.278 --> 01:41:08.619]  And that call wasn't even that bad.
[01:41:08.699 --> 01:41:09.519]  Some are even worse.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.360]  You know what?
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:14.562]  I'm going to go to Tim and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:41:14.903 --> 01:41:17.384]  But here is a little clip from the Colbert Report.
[01:41:18.945 --> 01:41:22.527]  The Daily Show has been so successful that they've now added the Colbert Report.
[01:41:22.547 --> 01:41:24.829]  And I've got to admit, it's some of the best news out there, bar none.
[01:41:25.567 --> 01:41:28.009]  And it's even funnier when you see the video of it.
[01:41:28.029 --> 01:41:31.992]  We have a link to it on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:41:32.613 --> 01:41:39.378]  But here is Colbert being sarcastic about how they're trying to play down 2,000 dead U.S.
[01:41:39.418 --> 01:41:39.838]  soldiers.
[01:41:39.878 --> 01:41:48.044]  And then the Fox News clips they're playing claim that, oh, and 400-plus troops didn't die in combat of the 2,000.
[01:41:48.545 --> 01:41:51.507]  No, the Pentagon admits over 8,000.
[01:41:52.248 --> 01:41:54.029]  And that was a few months ago when I saw those numbers.
[01:41:54.865 --> 01:41:56.726]  Have died from their wounds.
[01:41:58.186 --> 01:42:00.767]  But they don't count as a combat casualty.
[01:42:01.168 --> 01:42:03.609]  See, they just manipulate Samant with different terms.
[01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:08.631]  Only 2,000 have died as combat casualties.
[01:42:09.811 --> 01:42:12.892]  And that's not counted unless you die in the theater.
[01:42:13.433 --> 01:42:16.254]  If you die on the helicopter, go into the med center.
[01:42:16.674 --> 01:42:22.076]  Or if you die on a jet taking you to Rammstein in Germany, it does not count.
[01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:24.971]  So see, all they did was just change the terms.
[01:42:25.551 --> 01:42:29.513]  From battlefield casualties, total casualties, total deceased.
[01:42:30.753 --> 01:42:34.275]  They just created a new term, and then that's the thing they advertised.
[01:42:34.395 --> 01:42:36.756]  Totally deceptive on its face.
[01:42:36.796 --> 01:42:42.258]  We've got upwards of 20,000 injured soldiers.
[01:42:42.278 --> 01:42:43.719]  8,000 of which have died.
[01:42:44.039 --> 01:42:49.081]  So 8,000, that was months ago, have died.
[01:42:49.767 --> 01:42:53.390]  And that counts people that got run over by trucks or crashing helicopters too.
[01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:55.152]  But 8,000 have died.
[01:42:56.533 --> 01:43:02.959]  So this number that, oh no, it's only 2,000 and 400 and something of those died in accidents, that's not true either.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.583]  Of the 8,000, there is a portion that did die in accidents.
[01:43:07.983 --> 01:43:08.304]  But it's 8,000.
[01:43:08.984 --> 01:43:12.347]  The Pentagon admits 8,000 people have died.
[01:43:13.248 --> 01:43:13.468]  U.S.
[01:43:13.508 --> 01:43:15.630]  soldiers, let's go ahead and roll this.
[01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:16.271]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:16.954 --> 01:43:19.995]  Here is another number I have heard a lot today.
[01:43:20.776 --> 01:43:21.456]  Two thousand.
[01:43:22.297 --> 01:43:23.717]  Nothing wrong with the number itself.
[01:43:23.957 --> 01:43:26.038]  Hell, five years ago we were celebrating it.
[01:43:26.598 --> 01:43:35.963]  But now, just by adding the phrase, fatalities in Iraq, the anti-war crowd is trying to spin that number negative.
[01:43:36.663 --> 01:43:38.364]  Which brings us to tonight's word.
[01:43:39.905 --> 01:43:40.605]  Perspective.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.626]  Now, I got to admit, this morning, that 2000 number even had me feeling down.
[01:43:46.026 --> 01:43:48.870]  Luckily, I turned on Fox and Friends.
[01:43:50.171 --> 01:43:51.593]  Friendly bunch over there at Fox.
[01:43:52.194 --> 01:43:56.720]  And co-host Steve Doocy reminded me of something I think a lot of us have forgotten.
[01:43:58.029 --> 01:43:59.850]  2,000 is a terrible number.
[01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:05.393]  But when you look at the historical aspect of how many have lost their lives, look at that.
[01:44:05.433 --> 01:44:05.853]  World War I, 116,000.
[01:44:05.893 --> 01:44:05.993]  WWII, 405,000.
[01:44:06.033 --> 01:44:06.173]  Vietnam, 58,000.
[01:44:06.214 --> 01:44:06.514]  The Gulf War, 382.
[01:44:06.554 --> 01:44:07.234]  And so far in Iraq, 2,000.
[01:44:07.294 --> 01:44:07.394]  See?
[01:44:07.414 --> 01:44:08.655]  Doesn't that make you feel better?
[01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:08.755]  Plus,
[01:44:26.286 --> 01:44:28.208]  They didn't even throw the Civil War up there.
[01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:32.632]  23,000 soldiers died in one day at Antietam.
[01:44:33.313 --> 01:44:37.617]  And that... And that seemed to be cool of everybody.
[01:44:38.558 --> 01:44:38.998]  Why?
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.962]  Because the cause was just.
[01:44:43.783 --> 01:44:50.429]  Now, of course, if it's an unjustified war, one death is too many.
[01:44:51.112 --> 01:44:55.535]  And unfortunately, people have lost sight of why America is making these sacrifices.
[01:44:55.875 --> 01:45:00.118]  Thankfully, the shorter, but just as friendly, Fox friend reminded us.
[01:45:01.099 --> 01:45:02.060]  Look what's happened in Lebanon.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:05.522]  The Syrians have pulled out, and the Lebanese people now have a vote and stake in their future.
[01:45:05.542 --> 01:45:09.865]  The Palestinians voted, and they now have their own section of land in Gaza.
[01:45:10.145 --> 01:45:14.748]  And on the other hand, Egypt actually had a vote in someone running against Hosni Mubarak for the first time ever.
[01:45:14.888 --> 01:45:18.691]  Believe it or not, if it is Saudi Arabia, they might even let women drive soon.
[01:45:19.617 --> 01:45:21.178]  Saudi women driving?
[01:45:21.198 --> 01:45:21.178]  2,000?
[01:45:22.619 --> 01:45:23.400]  Hell, make it 200,000!
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:30.385]  Hey, and if you find a WMD or an Al-Qaeda connection, you can go to a cool million.
[01:45:31.206 --> 01:45:33.828]  So, this all raises a good question.
[01:45:34.388 --> 01:45:35.269]  Female Fox friend?
[01:45:36.548 --> 01:45:47.201]  I'm not being cavalier about this, but I don't understand the significance of this mark versus any other, you know, the 2000th versus any other death there.
[01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:48.302]  It's the news media.
[01:45:48.322 --> 01:45:49.444]  They're looking for a headline.
[01:45:49.524 --> 01:45:49.884]  Exactly.
[01:45:53.166 --> 01:46:10.520]  Sensationalist garbage like the Washington Post's military has lost 2,000 in Iraq, or the spin masters at the New York Times, 2,000 dead as Iraq tours stretch on, a grim mark, and someone was way too eager to put this one up on TV.
[01:46:11.201 --> 01:46:12.742]  Sad milestone.
[01:46:13.843 --> 01:46:15.905]  Spin on, left-wing spin machine.
[01:46:16.986 --> 01:46:20.989]  You know, and as Steve Doocy points out, the number 2,000 is just more hype.
[01:46:23.166 --> 01:46:33.730]  There's one thing about the 2000 number that the Pentagon pointed out yesterday, and that is that 436 of those deaths were non-combat related.
[01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:35.751]  Non-combat related?
[01:46:36.251 --> 01:46:37.331]  That means they're accidents.
[01:46:37.371 --> 01:46:37.871]  Forget them.
[01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:39.812]  Accidents don't count.
[01:46:40.853 --> 01:46:47.235]  And you know if the peaceniks in the anti-war machine get their way and this war turns out to have been a big mistake.
[01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:52.872]  That just means every death was an accident, and therefore, nobody died.
[01:46:53.992 --> 01:46:55.273]  Keep that in perspective.
[01:46:56.114 --> 01:46:56.874]  And that's the word.
[01:46:58.255 --> 01:47:06.501]  All right, and of course, Fox had up on the screen while they're saying it's no big deal, a sad milestone, so that was the joke.
[01:47:06.561 --> 01:47:08.682]  Oh, look at that liberal spin machine.
[01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.343]  They've got a lot of nerve, folks.
[01:47:10.864 --> 01:47:12.765]  You go to those 2,000 mothers, those 2,000 fathers,
[01:47:16.048 --> 01:47:18.069]  Those 4,000 grandmothers and grandfathers.
[01:47:18.989 --> 01:47:24.871]  You go to the tens of thousands of neighbors and cousins and best friends.
[01:47:25.371 --> 01:47:27.152]  You go to them and tell them it's no big deal.
[01:47:29.293 --> 01:47:33.014]  And we're right up there at 20,000 injured.
[01:47:34.374 --> 01:47:39.456]  Arms, legs blown off, and because of the body armor, people who would have died in the past are living, but
[01:47:40.557 --> 01:47:53.661]  They are basically, I mean, there are thousands of them who have been hit in the helmet by pretty good-sized rounds that are brain damaged, or people that have been hit by grenades, and it blows both their arms off and shatters all their ribs, and now they don't have arms and legs.
[01:47:53.681 --> 01:47:56.602]  In fact, there's quite a few that are quad amputees.
[01:47:57.763 --> 01:47:58.483]  Quad, folks.
[01:47:59.283 --> 01:48:00.724]  Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.
[01:48:01.584 --> 01:48:01.944]  Four.
[01:48:02.364 --> 01:48:04.165]  Both arms, both legs blown off.
[01:48:05.911 --> 01:48:10.373]  But the body armor keeps the key organs intact.
[01:48:11.333 --> 01:48:14.575]  In fact, all these poor guys are losing their genitalia.
[01:48:15.675 --> 01:48:24.899]  And so these Fox Friends people, why don't they go send their kids over there, their sons and daughters, to come back without arms and legs, and then get up there, you little punks.
[01:48:25.652 --> 01:48:31.233]  And get up there on your stupid Fox News, ultra-communist television, meant to neutralize conservatives.
[01:48:31.733 --> 01:48:33.914]  Get up there on your little enemy transmission tower.
[01:48:34.354 --> 01:48:48.536]  And then after your kids are dead, or come home maimed, or come home brain dead, and you've got to go visit them every day as they sit there with feeding tubes down their throats, and then you shoot your mouth off.
[01:48:50.336 --> 01:48:53.037]  One dead soldier is too many for your stinking fraud.
[01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:58.756]  I want to see that Silver Spoon wash-up, George Bush.
[01:48:58.916 --> 01:49:00.898]  I want to see him and the rest of their chicken hawks.
[01:49:01.399 --> 01:49:02.820]  I want to see them send their kids.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:06.884]  There's one member of Congress whose son's an officer in the Marine Corps.
[01:49:07.264 --> 01:49:07.665]  That's it.
[01:49:09.166 --> 01:49:10.688]  I want to see all their kids in there.
[01:49:11.696 --> 01:49:15.979]  But no, they've screwed the economy up so bad, the only job a lot of people can get is in the military.
[01:49:16.179 --> 01:49:17.960]  And then you pump them full of deadly vaccines.
[01:49:18.141 --> 01:49:19.782]  And then you have them breathe depleted uranium.
[01:49:20.182 --> 01:49:23.344]  And weirdos out there say we've got to support the troops and stay in Iraq?
[01:49:23.644 --> 01:49:24.985]  How does it support the troops?
[01:49:25.466 --> 01:49:27.927]  Keeping them in a fraud, keeping them in a meat grinder.
[01:49:28.508 --> 01:49:31.090]  Well, the others died in vain unless we stay in there.
[01:49:32.491 --> 01:49:35.673]  That's like if somebody falls off a cliff, we better throw a hundred more off.
[01:49:36.113 --> 01:49:40.056]  You know, the first five died in vain if we don't throw another hundred off.
[01:49:41.238 --> 01:49:42.059]  It's just idiocy.
[01:49:42.799 --> 01:49:45.281]  Look, draft Jenna Bush as the bumper stick reads.
[01:49:45.922 --> 01:49:50.645]  Stick his two little spoiled daughters in there.
[01:49:54.631 --> 01:49:57.512]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.752 --> 01:49:59.332]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.672 --> 01:50:04.334]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.674 --> 01:50:09.115]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.535 --> 01:50:13.696]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.936 --> 01:50:16.777]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.877 --> 01:50:21.540]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:26.162]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.382 --> 01:50:33.626]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.846 --> 01:50:36.267]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.427 --> 01:50:38.168]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:54.366 --> 01:50:57.349]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.709 --> 01:51:06.537]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.857 --> 01:51:11.541]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.001 --> 01:51:18.707]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.108 --> 01:51:30.898]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.378 --> 01:51:35.824]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:36.004 --> 01:51:38.447]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:38.487 --> 01:51:40.309]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:51:41.610 --> 01:51:43.072]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:43.092 --> 01:51:44.133]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.983 --> 01:52:00.925]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.165 --> 01:52:03.406]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.606 --> 01:52:07.927]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,

[01:52:30.486 --> 01:52:31.147]  We're good to go.
[01:52:58.186 --> 01:53:13.736]  I'm telling you, folks, it was really great being there last night at the Alamo Movie Theater with an overflow crowd.
[01:53:13.996 --> 01:53:23.882]  There were probably 20, 30 people that walked up to me once the film had started that were unable to get tickets, were unable to get in, and were asking me to have another showing.
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:30.263]  And I promised that it would be the last showing yesterday, so I'm sorry we're not going to have another showing of the Order of Death.
[01:53:31.963 --> 01:53:35.005]  But it will be available on DVD and VHS in a couple weeks.
[01:53:36.625 --> 01:53:44.969]  We're looking at about two or three weeks, but as soon as the DVDs have been stamped and manufactured, we'll start offering it.
[01:53:45.469 --> 01:53:47.270]  It's being authored right now.
[01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:48.611]  It's being mastered right now.
[01:53:49.211 --> 01:53:50.252]  We don't burn DVDs.
[01:53:50.272 --> 01:53:53.173]  We have them industrially stamped so they work on all the DVD players.
[01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:56.067]  You start burning DVDs, you run into problems.
[01:53:57.628 --> 01:53:58.248]  Side issue.
[01:53:58.288 --> 01:54:00.109]  Why am I talking about burning DVDs?
[01:54:03.331 --> 01:54:05.492]  It was great, though, seeing all of you out there last night.
[01:54:05.512 --> 01:54:06.492]  I always enjoy it.
[01:54:06.532 --> 01:54:07.433]  Such great people.
[01:54:09.434 --> 01:54:13.756]  And coming up in three or four months, I will show the British film we're making.
[01:54:14.096 --> 01:54:15.557]  And that's only one small part of it.
[01:54:15.577 --> 01:54:17.277]  I'm just calling it the British film right now.
[01:54:18.138 --> 01:54:20.219]  But it's going to be a great video.
[01:54:20.239 --> 01:54:21.179]  Believe me, it's excellent.
[01:54:21.379 --> 01:54:22.180]  So I look forward to
[01:54:23.699 --> 01:54:25.601]  Doing that in three or four months again at the Alamo.
[01:54:26.242 --> 01:54:46.000]  If you want a hard copy of any of my films, Martial Law or the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, while it's still available, or if you want any of the other videos and books we carry, George Humphreys' 9-11, The Great Illusion, the new book by Jim Tucker, The Bilderberg Diary, excellent book.

[01:55:24.483 --> 01:55:28.106]  We're going to start the next hour and go to Tim and Alex and a few other callers.
[01:55:28.886 --> 01:55:37.934]  And then we've got Reverend Ted Pike joining us to give us an update on the new hate crime bill that they've renamed yet again.
[01:55:37.954 --> 01:55:40.136]  And we'll continue with calls in the news.
[01:55:40.236 --> 01:55:46.741]  But here's USA Radio Network that we carry giving you the latest on the indictment.
[01:55:46.961 --> 01:55:47.342]  Here it is.
[01:55:48.015 --> 01:55:54.638]  Vice President Cheney's Chief of Staff, Lewis Scooter Libby, has been indicted in the leak of a CIA operative's name.
[01:55:54.678 --> 01:55:58.780]  He's been charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements.
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.321]  In all, it's a five-count indictment.
[01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:06.623]  Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler says Libby encouraged him to come forward about the CIA leak.
[01:56:07.103 --> 01:56:12.810]  Kessler says the prosecutor asked about two specific conversations he had with Libby about Valerie Plame.
[01:56:12.850 --> 01:56:19.036]  As part of my agreement with the prosecutor, I did not have to reveal the contents of those conversations to him.
[01:56:19.056 --> 01:56:24.823]  I only had to talk about whether Plame or Wilson were raised in those conversations, and what I told him was they were not.
[01:56:25.103 --> 01:56:29.826]  No criminal charges expected today against President Bush's top political advisor, Karl Rove.
[01:56:30.226 --> 01:56:37.271]  Criminal defense attorney Edward McMahon says the prosecutor might be trying to bet that Rove will implicate himself by threatening an indictment.
[01:56:37.311 --> 01:56:39.092]  What he may have been doing was bluffing.
[01:56:39.152 --> 01:56:45.256]  He could have gone to Karl Rove's attorney and said, you're going to get indicted on Friday, or I think you're going to get indicted on Friday.
[01:56:45.656 --> 01:56:46.657]  You want to cut a deal.
[01:56:47.358 --> 01:56:52.280]  President Bush today saying the nation must realize Iraq's still the central front in the war on terrorism.
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:57:03.185]  Would the United States and other free nations be more safe or less safe with Zarqawi and bin Laden in control of Iraq, its people, and its resources?
[01:57:03.785 --> 01:57:07.186]  The Dow's up 86 points, the Nasdaq is plus 11.
[01:57:07.606 --> 01:57:09.347]  USA Radio Network.
[01:57:10.287 --> 01:57:13.869]  Yep, USA Radio Network News, Alan Stone reporting.
[01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:24.056]  Alright, we'll be right back with the third hour of this Friday edition jam-packed with calls, news, and an update on thought crime.
[01:57:24.956 --> 01:57:29.039]  Yeah, Bush is doing everything he can to turn America into a slave state.
[01:57:29.419 --> 01:57:31.460]  So don't shoot your mouth off about free countries.
[01:57:33.301 --> 01:57:37.884]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.555 --> 01:57:50.195]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.855 --> 01:57:51.936]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.636 --> 01:57:53.797]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.397 --> 01:57:55.217]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.958 --> 01:57:56.878]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.538 --> 01:58:01.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:05.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.745 --> 01:58:14.046]  Well, scooter-living...
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:26.807]  Nick Cheney's chief of staff, a very evil little creature, has been indicted five counts, perjury, obstruction of justice, and what was the other one?
[01:58:26.987 --> 01:58:27.748]  False statements.
[01:58:28.848 --> 01:58:32.931]  So he's not getting in trouble for the crimes he's committed, he's getting in trouble for lying about it.
[01:58:32.951 --> 01:58:39.295]  Because they can't prosecute him for the crimes, because that leads on to bigger fish.
[01:58:39.335 --> 01:58:43.278]  This is just going to be a big political witch hunt.
[01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:46.961]  But on petty issues, so no bigwigs really get hurt.
[01:58:46.981 --> 01:58:49.822]  It's going to be a big theatrical display.
[01:58:50.842 --> 01:58:54.443]  Let's go to Tim in Ohio, and then Alex and Smokey and others.
[01:58:54.483 --> 01:58:55.103]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:58:55.503 --> 01:59:00.364]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones, and I'd like to say hello to all the freedom-loving listeners here on GCN.
[01:59:00.504 --> 01:59:02.324]  And today you can call me Stooley.
[01:59:03.564 --> 01:59:04.525]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:59:04.645 --> 01:59:06.085]  It is the theater all the way.
[01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:06.505]  And you know what?
[01:59:06.885 --> 01:59:08.465]  Question the timing of it.
[01:59:08.765 --> 01:59:12.846]  Here we are, the end of October, the beginning of November, in television.
[01:59:13.937 --> 01:59:22.523]  All across the board, the biggest ratings period is right now, in the next four weeks, is what they set their ad rate at for the big Christmas shopping season.
[01:59:24.885 --> 01:59:29.709]  Oh, so you think it's some cynical way just to get people to tune into TV, period, to see all the ads.
[01:59:29.869 --> 01:59:30.129]  Sure.
[01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:31.870]  It's all part of it.
[01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:32.531]  They always do that.
[01:59:32.551 --> 01:59:34.792]  They always hold the biggest stuff until the ratings period.
[01:59:35.153 --> 01:59:35.593]  It's happened.
[01:59:35.793 --> 01:59:38.895]  I observed that with the Michael Jackson case, with...
[01:59:40.124 --> 01:59:44.045]  Oh, I mean, prosecutors admittedly announce things when they'll have maximum effect.
[01:59:44.525 --> 01:59:50.007]  Notice a Friday early in the day going into the weekend would totally dominate the weekend cycle.
[01:59:50.227 --> 01:59:52.027]  Right, and they do it all over.
[01:59:52.127 --> 01:59:53.807]  You just have to question the timing of it, yeah.
[01:59:54.068 --> 01:59:59.929]  And about Myers, yeah, she's a bait and switch, just like I think they did with Chertoff.
[02:00:00.489 --> 02:00:03.490]  Remember, they tried to get the old NYPD police chief in there.
[02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:07.790]  Yeah, knowing full well the guy didn't even have a high school diploma and was a thug.
[02:00:08.051 --> 02:00:09.071]  Was a thug, that's right.
[02:00:09.391 --> 02:00:17.973]  And I'm calling here from the great state of Ohio, who has no shortage of corruption down in Columbus, our state government.
[02:00:18.273 --> 02:00:21.913]  We're starting to have an indictment junior going on down here.
[02:00:22.093 --> 02:00:29.735]  A coin dealer named Thomas Noe was given money from the state workers' compensation fund.
[02:00:30.273 --> 02:00:36.235]  Which he in turn invested into rare coins, because he also had a coin business on the side.
[02:00:36.595 --> 02:00:43.658]  And it turns out that he was giving profits to other people to give to the Bush campaign.
[02:00:43.938 --> 02:00:46.019]  And he's looking at like 15 years in prison up here.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:48.360]  Amazing.
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:53.902]  But look, I mean, some of the companies they've used, like Choice Point, has open felons running it.
[02:00:54.462 --> 02:00:56.683]  Just everywhere you look, it's crooks.
[02:00:56.783 --> 02:00:58.384]  It's just such a web of...
[02:00:59.149 --> 02:01:01.271]  Well, they have to find crooks to work for them.
[02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:04.193]  I mean, they're doing evil things.
[02:01:04.213 --> 02:01:07.155]  They have to find crooks, because crooks will do illegal things.
[02:01:07.475 --> 02:01:08.496]  And I remind people to do that.
[02:01:08.556 --> 02:01:19.544]  It's not only just illegal money going from the fund that's supposed to help injured workers here in the state, which is criminal enough, but then going to Bush, and then we look back.
[02:01:19.884 --> 02:01:22.086]  But Bush is fighting Al-Qaeda, so it's okay.
[02:01:22.106 --> 02:01:22.767]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:22.787 --> 02:01:26.009]  Did you hear Bush talk about Zarqawi when I played that news clip earlier?
[02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:29.032]  Even mainstream news now makes jokes about it.
[02:01:29.072 --> 02:01:31.834]  I mean, they've killed him and captured him over a dozen times.
[02:01:31.874 --> 02:01:32.674]  It's over 12 times.
[02:01:34.736 --> 02:01:35.896]  We killed number two again.
[02:01:35.937 --> 02:01:37.077]  We captured number two again.
[02:01:37.117 --> 02:01:37.498]  We killed him.
[02:01:37.518 --> 02:01:38.058]  We captured him.
[02:01:38.558 --> 02:01:39.719]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:01:39.919 --> 02:01:43.362]  Notice how they try to take Zarqawi and replace bin Laden with that.
[02:01:45.003 --> 02:01:45.763]  It's unbelievable.
[02:01:46.104 --> 02:01:47.925]  Alex, go ahead in New Hampshire.
[02:01:47.945 --> 02:01:48.525]  You're on the air.
[02:01:49.106 --> 02:01:50.106]  Yeah, power to you, Alex.
[02:01:50.126 --> 02:01:51.487]  I just want to say thanks a lot.
[02:01:51.507 --> 02:01:52.888]  You know, God's will with you.
[02:01:52.928 --> 02:01:53.989]  You know, we can do this.
[02:01:54.409 --> 02:01:55.110]  It's like, you know...
[02:01:55.979 --> 02:02:00.943]  It's such a multifaceted evil that it's going to take a multifaceted good to take care of it.
[02:02:01.023 --> 02:02:07.189]  It's going to take the Lord above and the angels and us and just all the strength of love we can do.
[02:02:07.509 --> 02:02:08.630]  And, you know, take them down.
[02:02:09.491 --> 02:02:10.091]  You do it, Alex.
[02:02:10.692 --> 02:02:12.433]  Well, you do it too, Alex.
[02:02:12.473 --> 02:02:13.434]  Is there an echo in here?
[02:02:13.454 --> 02:02:16.196]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[02:02:16.236 --> 02:02:17.217]  I appreciate the call.
[02:02:17.698 --> 02:02:20.340]  Don't worry, Smokey and others, Paula will...
[02:02:20.979 --> 02:02:22.360]  We'll get to you in order here.
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:23.040]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:23.120]  1-800.
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:27.003]  I didn't give the number out for like an hour and a half.
[02:02:27.043 --> 02:02:28.584]  It's always good to give the number out.
[02:02:28.604 --> 02:02:30.505]  I forgot about... Oh, this is talk radio.
[02:02:30.525 --> 02:02:30.885]  What am I doing?
[02:02:30.905 --> 02:02:31.005]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:31.025 --> 02:02:32.166]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:02:32.186 --> 02:02:32.806]  PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com.
[02:02:32.826 --> 02:02:33.367]  They're excellent sites.
[02:02:45.871 --> 02:02:53.257]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.517 --> 02:02:58.281]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.501 --> 02:03:04.146]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.386 --> 02:03:08.888]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.129 --> 02:03:16.272]  The cashless society control grid, implanable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.292 --> 02:03:20.835]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.995 --> 02:03:23.496]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[02:03:23.736 --> 02:03:30.440]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:35.944]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.964 --> 02:03:36.365]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.018 --> 02:03:53.640]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:04:05.123]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.343 --> 02:04:08.004]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.344 --> 02:04:12.445]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:04:12.805 --> 02:04:23.048]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.288 --> 02:04:28.950]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:33.213]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:33.953 --> 02:04:34.954]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:49.047]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:04:49.307 --> 02:04:53.249]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:04:53.529 --> 02:05:00.833]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste spill is something we all face every day.
[02:05:01.113 --> 02:05:03.034]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[02:05:03.334 --> 02:05:10.097]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:05:10.437 --> 02:05:13.319]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[02:05:13.599 --> 02:05:19.043]  Your nuclear alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[02:05:19.303 --> 02:05:20.684]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:21.505 --> 02:05:26.208]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear alert today.
[02:05:26.529 --> 02:05:29.731]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:05:30.091 --> 02:05:34.595]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:05:34.875 --> 02:05:35.095]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:37.877 --> 02:05:41.840]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nook Alert today.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:42.441]  Nook Alert.
[02:05:42.741 --> 02:05:43.802]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:05:45.843 --> 02:05:48.025]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.625 --> 02:05:51.468]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.609 --> 02:05:57.912]  We have a government with officials in it.
[02:05:58.153 --> 02:06:02.736]  Authority is government gods being indicted.
[02:06:03.977 --> 02:06:06.179]  And we're down here to little pathetic commoners.
[02:06:07.677 --> 02:06:16.279]  But meanwhile, the Senate passes a resolution saying we will follow the law and not torture people severely.
[02:06:17.879 --> 02:06:18.919]  And Bush says, no.
[02:06:19.999 --> 02:06:22.260]  We're going to continue torturing and I'm going to veto that.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:22.960]  Think about that.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:31.241]  And then Bush will still send people who they openly ordered to torture to prison.
[02:06:33.022 --> 02:06:33.522]  Think about that.
[02:06:33.542 --> 02:06:35.582]  They order them to torture and that doesn't
[02:06:36.568 --> 02:06:37.908]  Absolve them from culpability.
[02:06:38.269 --> 02:06:45.511]  This following order doesn't protect Grainer or England or any of those sickos, but shouldn't the people that gave the orders get in more trouble?
[02:06:46.011 --> 02:06:49.112]  No, they just stand there and openly on TV go, I'm for torture!
[02:06:52.313 --> 02:06:54.373]  I'm going to veto a law against it!
[02:06:55.193 --> 02:06:58.975]  I don't even know why there needs to be a law saying you can't torture.
[02:06:59.115 --> 02:07:00.155]  There's already laws.
[02:07:00.175 --> 02:07:00.935]  They're breaking laws.
[02:07:01.115 --> 02:07:02.656]  That's why those people went to prison.
[02:07:02.696 --> 02:07:03.656]  What, five of them now?
[02:07:05.433 --> 02:07:07.475]  They ordered a contractor to torture people.
[02:07:07.535 --> 02:07:11.878]  He tortured some people to death, and for some reason some good military men blew the whistle on it.
[02:07:12.638 --> 02:07:16.941]  And they were going to slap him on the wrist until the guy protested and said, Hey, I was ordered to do this.
[02:07:17.382 --> 02:07:18.302]  And they said, Shut up.
[02:07:18.342 --> 02:07:24.947]  We're really charging you now with felonies, and we're gagging you under the Patriot Act where you can't even defend yourself.
[02:07:25.227 --> 02:07:31.692]  So they're going to send that contractor to prison for life, and he can't even have an open trial or talk to the media.
[02:07:32.172 --> 02:07:34.434]  They're using a Patriot Act provision on him.
[02:07:36.297 --> 02:07:45.302]  From one of the torture camps with Bagram Air Base over there in the Middle East.
[02:07:45.762 --> 02:07:48.244]  So it never ends.
[02:07:49.725 --> 02:07:53.947]  I know I'm perseverating on this issue that is repeating it over and over again, but think about that.
[02:07:55.194 --> 02:07:57.235]  People are going to prison for torturing.
[02:07:57.355 --> 02:08:03.719]  We've had General Karpinski, the head general over at the camp, she wasn't even allowed into the areas where the torture was going on.
[02:08:03.739 --> 02:08:06.541]  That was under military intelligence and CIA control.
[02:08:07.562 --> 02:08:10.523]  They tried to scapegoat her, but none of their own people.
[02:08:12.064 --> 02:08:19.809]  And then now we all learn that the orders came, we even get the memos, directly from the top, and as if we needed more proof, Bush goes on TV and says, I'm for torture.
[02:08:21.934 --> 02:08:24.735]  Now, we've got new hate crime, new thought crime legislation.
[02:08:25.055 --> 02:08:26.055]  Again, we're in a fight.
[02:08:26.075 --> 02:08:27.456]  They're throwing more punches.
[02:08:27.856 --> 02:08:29.556]  They're firing more torpedoes at us.
[02:08:29.976 --> 02:08:37.399]  And they keep tagging it on to bills, pork barrel law enforcement bills, that the mind control bill has nothing to do with.
[02:08:38.059 --> 02:08:43.821]  The thought crime bill, the free speech decimating bill, has nothing to do with.
[02:08:45.041 --> 02:08:48.262]  But before we get into that, I want to get Ted Pikes, because he's a pastor.
[02:08:49.013 --> 02:08:50.533]  Pastor, it's good to have you on.
[02:08:50.553 --> 02:08:55.274]  I appreciate you leading the charge against the thought crime bill, but side issue, torture.
[02:08:55.755 --> 02:08:57.075]  The disciples were tortured.
[02:08:57.255 --> 02:08:58.175]  Christ was tortured.
[02:08:58.675 --> 02:09:03.096]  We know torture is evil, but if you could speak to that, I would appreciate it.
[02:09:03.576 --> 02:09:11.318]  And then also, on just the out-in-the-open corruption and almost schizophrenia, why isn't Bush being indicted?
[02:09:11.358 --> 02:09:15.559]  Why isn't Gonzalez, the Attorney General, the head law enforcement officer,
[02:09:16.249 --> 02:09:20.412]  Why isn't he being indicted for openly writing memos ordering people to torture?
[02:09:21.413 --> 02:09:24.075]  And then before the Senate, he wouldn't even go back on it.
[02:09:24.115 --> 02:09:25.156]  He said, yeah, I'm for torture.
[02:09:25.736 --> 02:09:31.441]  And Bush says that he's for torture, but that he'll send people to prison who followed orders.
[02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:36.044]  Can you give us your scholarly take on that, sir?
[02:09:36.404 --> 02:09:37.105]  Yes, Alex.
[02:09:37.265 --> 02:09:41.068]  We are being prepared for an international police state.
[02:09:41.604 --> 02:09:42.444]  Yes, I think so.
[02:10:04.089 --> 02:10:04.909]  I forget his name.
[02:10:05.049 --> 02:10:06.110]  I got an email.
[02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:07.611]  His wife is pleading.
[02:10:07.911 --> 02:10:12.154]  He was just literally taken off the street and thrown in prison here in the United States.
[02:10:12.214 --> 02:10:20.880]  And regardless, folks, of whether you agree with her views or disagree, I disagree with this black leader that said, kill all whites last week on TV.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:27.084]  But I don't think that he should have his free speech taken, because if you take his free speech, folks, we all lose ours.
[02:10:27.504 --> 02:10:27.784]  Yes.
[02:10:28.125 --> 02:10:30.446]  I believe his name is something like Rudolph Germar.
[02:10:30.526 --> 02:10:31.147]  I met him at a...
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:35.702]  The American Free Press conference in Washington a few years ago.
[02:10:36.163 --> 02:10:46.509]  But you see what the strategy is here, is to gradually condition people for preparing them to accept, without protest, a coming police state.
[02:10:46.869 --> 02:10:52.252]  And so we're seeing gradually people snatched up by the immigration services, deported.
[02:10:53.133 --> 02:10:57.775]  We are finding, as you say, the incidence of torture...
[02:10:59.352 --> 02:11:00.872]  Put into the public arena.
[02:11:01.273 --> 02:11:02.773]  And these things are necessary.
[02:11:02.793 --> 02:11:07.274]  They're kind of preludes to gradually... Well, they're prerequisites.
[02:11:07.334 --> 02:11:08.194]  They're prerequisites.
[02:11:08.274 --> 02:11:08.815]  That's right.
[02:11:10.055 --> 02:11:11.755]  At the first, there's a shock value.
[02:11:12.055 --> 02:11:20.438]  I think it was Pope who said, we first... Vices of such a horrid mean as to be hated, it needs only to be seen.
[02:11:20.818 --> 02:11:25.579]  But seen too often, familiar with its face, we first endure...
[02:11:26.494 --> 02:11:29.856]  We first abhor, and then we endure, and then we embrace.
[02:11:30.216 --> 02:11:36.040]  And we're in the stage now, we're kind of in the foothills of an Antichrist system.
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:37.340]  They're bathing us in it.
[02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:39.442]  Every day, world government's good.
[02:11:39.782 --> 02:11:42.143]  Tommy Thompson, every child needs a microchip.
[02:11:42.183 --> 02:11:44.605]  Sean Hannity, every child needs a microchip.
[02:11:45.185 --> 02:11:47.486]  Andy Rooney, you must have one to prove you're good.
[02:11:47.746 --> 02:11:51.488]  We've got to restrict free speech because these hate mongers are using it.
[02:11:51.729 --> 02:11:56.571]  We've got to ban protests because the Klan will be able to march unless we ban free speech.
[02:11:56.871 --> 02:12:03.795]  We've got to, exactly, just over and over and over and over again, at every level, they're literally bathing us in this.
[02:12:04.135 --> 02:12:04.615]  That's right.
[02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:09.098]  And it doesn't bother them that we are shocked initially by these outrages.
[02:12:09.418 --> 02:12:12.741]  That's part of the conditioning, the Pavlovian process.
[02:12:12.761 --> 02:12:14.842]  They just keep doing it, keep doing it, you're absolutely right.
[02:12:14.862 --> 02:12:15.243]  That's right.
[02:12:15.463 --> 02:12:18.525]  And pretty soon people will say, well, there's nothing I can do about it.
[02:12:18.545 --> 02:12:20.046]  It was the same way with abortion.
[02:12:20.406 --> 02:12:27.712]  Pretty soon the figures come in, the millions and millions of babies, and then it's almost an issue that's downstream for most people.
[02:12:27.932 --> 02:12:29.233]  It's called acclimation.
[02:12:29.513 --> 02:12:30.134]  That's right.
[02:12:30.714 --> 02:12:34.137]  And it's the Pavlovian technique of conditioning.
[02:12:34.177 --> 02:12:34.277]  Now,
[02:12:34.677 --> 02:12:45.306]  What we have to do at this initial stage where we are being shocked, purposely shocked, by the government and by these tremendous forces... I've got to stop you again.
[02:12:45.466 --> 02:12:49.970]  Whoever thought they would just say, you don't own your private property, we don't even have to pay you for it.
[02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:52.452]  If some private person wants it, we're going to take it.
[02:12:53.052 --> 02:12:53.593]  That's right.
[02:12:54.473 --> 02:13:10.666]  Who would have ever thought they'd pass a new freedom initiative, which they're now slowly implementing, to forcibly take your children twice a year, whether they're homeschooled, private schooled, whatever, and forcibly, psychologically test them and drug them with a handbook written by the drug companies?
[02:13:11.006 --> 02:13:17.771]  Who would have ever thought they'd arrest seven Christians and try to put them in jail for 47 years for kneeling and praying in Philadelphia?
[02:13:18.051 --> 02:13:18.612]  Exactly.
[02:13:18.652 --> 02:13:19.893]  That's just what I was going to say.
[02:13:19.953 --> 02:13:21.814]  I think Len Abraham and the ADL a year ago...
[02:13:22.975 --> 02:13:23.275]  I think so.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:50.294]  What we have to do is we have to protest very, very loudly and keep our moral sensitivities intact because they want to numb our morals and our moral conscience.
[02:13:50.874 --> 02:13:54.258]  One of the most precious things to me is a sensitive, God-given conscience
[02:13:54.517 --> 02:13:59.078]  And humanly cultivated, if you will, moral sensitivity to right and wrong.
[02:13:59.118 --> 02:14:01.479]  That is the birthright of every human being.
[02:14:01.519 --> 02:14:06.400]  Well, you know, for 50 years they've acted like it's bad, it's weak, it's square, it's stupid.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:10.942]  No, folks, you know, I'm somebody who... I mean, I was never that wild, but I was pretty wild.
[02:14:11.222 --> 02:14:13.182]  And nothing was fun when you're like that.
[02:14:13.963 --> 02:14:17.684]  You enjoy things more when you do cultivate your morals.
[02:14:18.044 --> 02:14:19.944]  I mean, they're there for a reason, folks.
[02:14:21.425 --> 02:14:22.285]  Yes, and...
[02:14:24.304 --> 02:14:41.394]  What I'm calling people to do right now is to react with shock that the House of Representatives five weeks ago, with only 40 minutes time in the House of Representatives, passed probably the most dangerous legislation, in my opinion, in the last century.
[02:14:41.695 --> 02:14:43.236]  We have to be shocked about that.
[02:14:44.216 --> 02:14:48.398]  We have to get to that phone and protest immediately while there is still time.
[02:14:48.438 --> 02:14:49.438]  Well, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:14:49.498 --> 02:14:54.480]  We have to do this because we love our families and love their future freedom and our current freedom.
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.963]  But we also have to, I have to say it, we also have to hate this evil and hate our enemies with a passion.
[02:15:01.043 --> 02:15:03.484]  Is that okay what I just said?
[02:15:03.504 --> 02:15:04.924]  That is very biblical.
[02:15:05.305 --> 02:15:08.486]  It says in the scriptures, Ye that love the Lord...
[02:15:09.039 --> 02:15:10.259]  Hate evil.
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:16.522]  Now, the ADL, who's the architect of all these hate laws we're fighting, turns it upside down.
[02:15:17.062 --> 02:15:26.965]  They make a bias against homosexuality into hate, and they make tolerance of homosexuality into love and respect for diversity.
[02:15:27.246 --> 02:15:33.568]  So we are fighting a topsy-turvy ethical system being imposed upon us.
[02:15:33.688 --> 02:15:35.509]  I want to say this even to the left out there.
[02:15:36.209 --> 02:15:36.529]  Listen.
[02:15:37.049 --> 02:15:39.712]  Folks, you're going to lose your free speech, too.
[02:15:39.772 --> 02:15:45.216]  I mean, they're going out and arresting people that protest George Bush peacefully, and, you know, giving them six months in prison.
[02:15:46.097 --> 02:15:50.761]  So don't think for a minute you're going to take Christians' free speech and you're not going to lose yours.
[02:15:51.121 --> 02:15:51.582]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:51.602 --> 02:15:56.586]  You know, I get emails now from England and New Zealand, Australia, and so on,
[02:15:57.037 --> 02:16:03.219]  And down in those countries, the ADL, the NIBREF hate laws are not even being called hate laws.
[02:16:03.639 --> 02:16:07.121]  They are being called anti-terrorism laws.
[02:16:07.641 --> 02:16:20.045]  And so in Australia, if you criticize Islam or you criticize Jewish control of the media or whatever, that's considered an act of domestic terrorism now in Australia or in England.
[02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:21.966]  I've got to stop you because you're making so many good points.
[02:16:22.146 --> 02:16:24.267]  Folks, we had Robin Page on three years ago
[02:16:24.967 --> 02:16:34.616]  BBC reporter for over two decades, one of the number one shows on BBC, one man and his dog, where he walks every episode from town to town with his dog.
[02:16:35.076 --> 02:16:38.179]  And he visits the different shops, the different stores, the different famous places.
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:46.506]  Kind of like that country reporter who we have on Texas TV stations here who's sponsored by Dairy Queen.
[02:16:46.626 --> 02:16:48.608]  Literally, folks, milquetoast show.
[02:16:49.275 --> 02:16:57.137]  They were banning fox hunting a couple years ago, and he was protesting it at a rural affairs rally of about a thousand people.
[02:16:57.157 --> 02:16:57.937]  This was on the BBC.
[02:16:59.178 --> 02:16:59.678]  We had him on.
[02:17:00.158 --> 02:17:07.400]  Robin Page simply went and said, farmers deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:18.483]  They arrested him saying that by using the word homosexual, he meant that meanly, and that they arrest you if they think you use the word homosexual as a derogatory term.
[02:17:19.468 --> 02:17:21.269]  Folks, that's Robin Page.
[02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:22.349]  We had him on the show.
[02:17:23.449 --> 02:17:26.030]  And that article's posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:28.010]  The original BBC article.
[02:17:29.010 --> 02:17:41.013]  I mean, it's gotten that bad where you can't... I think it was one headline in the London Guardian about 100 hate arrests last night for people that were heard making racial comments under their breath.
[02:17:41.533 --> 02:17:43.954]  Imagine cops arresting you for what you say.
[02:17:45.749 --> 02:17:52.614]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:17:52.774 --> 02:18:05.703]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joins forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:18:05.883 --> 02:18:07.664]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:18:07.824 --> 02:18:08.424]  We're good to go.
[02:18:26.971 --> 02:18:28.051]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[02:18:28.071 --> 02:18:28.572]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[02:18:47.293 --> 02:18:48.334]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:48.654 --> 02:18:51.456]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:51.716 --> 02:18:55.879]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:57.120]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.004]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.504 --> 02:19:04.625]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:05.105 --> 02:19:19.810]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:19:45.359 --> 02:19:46.339]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:19:46.419 --> 02:19:51.201]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:19:51.361 --> 02:19:59.165]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:19:59.425 --> 02:20:04.807]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:20:05.007 --> 02:20:11.990]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:12.910]  We're good to go.
[02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:13.090]  I think?
[02:20:30.877 --> 02:20:31.498]  We're good to go.
[02:20:44.705 --> 02:20:48.087]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:20:48.327 --> 02:20:48.667]  Why?
[02:20:48.687 --> 02:20:51.629]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:56.632]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:20:56.772 --> 02:21:06.477]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[02:21:31.931 --> 02:21:33.732]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[02:21:45.412 --> 02:21:47.613]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:21:47.633 --> 02:21:51.035]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:51.055 --> 02:21:56.037]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment and we'll recap what happened to Scooter Libby.
[02:21:56.097 --> 02:21:58.838]  Five indictments.
[02:21:59.838 --> 02:22:01.219]  Five counts in the indictment.
[02:22:01.259 --> 02:22:05.541]  The specific perjury and obstruction of justice and false statements.
[02:22:07.262 --> 02:22:12.584]  We're talking to Pastor Ted Pike who for decades has been leading the fight against hate bills and
[02:22:13.211 --> 02:22:15.432]  There's already laws against committing crimes, folks.
[02:22:16.332 --> 02:22:18.533]  Against attacking people, against things of that nature.
[02:22:19.033 --> 02:22:23.514]  This new bill will federalize all of this.
[02:22:24.174 --> 02:22:25.835]  It's a huge federalization bill.
[02:22:25.855 --> 02:22:36.278]  It's a huge federal power grab down into every county and city and new federal crimes to charge you with just if somebody complains that you basically looked at them wrong.
[02:22:37.446 --> 02:22:45.548]  George Bush's Justice Department advised Philadelphia on how to put Christians in jail, and there's video of this, for kneeling and praying on a street corner.
[02:22:46.248 --> 02:22:49.209]  Because it was offensive to people at a, quote, outfest.
[02:22:49.749 --> 02:22:51.730]  Whether it's offensive or not to them, it doesn't matter, folks.
[02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:52.930]  It's the First Amendment.
[02:22:54.610 --> 02:22:56.891]  And, you know, take the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:22:57.231 --> 02:22:59.512]  They're coming to Austin next weekend, next Saturday.
[02:22:59.972 --> 02:23:01.312]  And I don't like the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:23:01.332 --> 02:23:04.333]  I think they're very distasteful in the Masonic organization.
[02:23:04.973 --> 02:23:05.153]  But...
[02:23:06.650 --> 02:23:10.453]  I will go out and protest anybody who says they don't have a right to protest.
[02:23:11.233 --> 02:23:17.738]  I mean, I'll go out and, you know, when Khalid Muhammad, they should ban Khalid Muhammad marching in Houston.
[02:23:18.318 --> 02:23:20.179]  He's the guy that says, you know, kill all the white people.
[02:23:20.219 --> 02:23:20.820]  He's dead now.
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:25.042]  And I remember getting on air and saying, let Khalid Muhammad march.
[02:23:27.164 --> 02:23:30.146]  And if they had tried to stop him, I would have gone down there and protested for him.
[02:23:31.186 --> 02:23:32.087]  It's important, folks.
[02:23:32.127 --> 02:23:33.728]  If we don't have this right, nobody does.
[02:23:34.542 --> 02:23:36.582]  I mean, this is a universal thing we're talking about.
[02:23:36.962 --> 02:23:39.863]  Ted, I don't think people realize that it was going to pass.
[02:23:39.923 --> 02:23:41.043]  It already had passed the House.
[02:23:41.543 --> 02:23:43.404]  It had passed that committee last year in the Senate.
[02:23:43.724 --> 02:23:49.425]  It was going to sail through, and this was a big victory, but now they're going to try to bring it out before the full Senate, aren't they?
[02:23:50.005 --> 02:23:50.345]  Yes.
[02:23:51.285 --> 02:23:59.327]  Senator Kennedy issued a press statement saying that he will go to the floor of the Senate soon, and he will demand...
[02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:01.226]  We're good to go.
[02:24:01.266 --> 02:24:02.327]  We're good to go.
[02:24:17.137 --> 02:24:20.018]  Senator Kennedy says, I want my bill back on.
[02:24:20.458 --> 02:24:31.181]  And this is no idle boast because 15 months ago his hate bill did sail through the Senate Judiciary Committee and literally within a day or two it was on the floor of the Senate.
[02:24:31.541 --> 02:24:32.961]  It passed 65 to 33.
[02:24:33.301 --> 02:24:38.083]  I was talking to several of Senator Kennedy's staffers last week.
[02:24:38.483 --> 02:24:43.324]  They are confident that the Senate is so liberal and so inclined
[02:24:43.892 --> 02:24:48.473]  Well, it's just like he signed campaign finance reform that restricted free speech.
[02:24:48.493 --> 02:24:49.053]  I mean, whatever evil...
[02:25:14.053 --> 02:25:15.434]  If it's evil, Bush is going to do it.
[02:25:16.014 --> 02:25:19.236]  And remember Ted Kennedy getting the award from George Bush Sr.?
[02:25:19.856 --> 02:25:21.818]  I mean, these guys are all in bed together.
[02:25:21.878 --> 02:25:32.124]  So many Democrats just think that Ted Kennedy is the second coming of Christ, and the guy is a pumpkinhead drunk who they've had over a barrel since Chappaquiddick.
[02:25:32.564 --> 02:25:32.824]  Yeah.
[02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:37.787]  Well, what we can expect from Ted Kennedy is everything we've seen since Chappaquiddick.
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:38.761]  We're good to go.
[02:26:02.063 --> 02:26:08.978]  They're expecting perhaps yesterday or today for Senator Kennedy to broach this to the Senate.
[02:26:09.238 --> 02:26:12.866]  Now, we're in a real position of advantage, folks, today because...
[02:26:13.368 --> 02:26:21.215]  Yesterday I was watching very closely, and the whole day in the Senate was glutted with appropriations bills and roll call votes.
[02:26:21.495 --> 02:26:23.637]  There was really no time for him to do that.
[02:26:23.977 --> 02:26:30.903]  But today they're kind of relaxing a little bit, and each senator is invited to speak for ten minutes on the floor of the Senate.
[02:26:31.223 --> 02:26:35.527]  This might be a perfect opportunity for Kennedy to take the floor.
[02:26:35.727 --> 02:26:36.768]  On the other hand...
[02:26:37.338 --> 02:26:44.400]  There will be no roll call votes allowed today, so that even if he makes his case, they can't vote on it.
[02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:52.143]  And so that gives us a perfect opportunity for the American people, again in one tidal wave of protest, to call in.
[02:26:52.163 --> 02:26:52.363]  All right.
[02:26:52.483 --> 02:26:53.723]  Ted Ply, give them the phone number.
[02:26:53.943 --> 02:26:54.183]  Yes.
[02:26:54.463 --> 02:26:56.404]  The phone number, which is toll free, is 888-355-
[02:27:00.723 --> 02:27:01.604]  We're good to go.
[02:27:01.624 --> 02:27:01.984]  I think?
[02:27:10.409 --> 02:27:23.914]  Now, if folks will come to my website, which is www.truthtellers.org, I have the 100 members of the Senate, the 55 Republicans.
[02:27:23.934 --> 02:27:25.394]  You've got it all right there.
[02:27:25.614 --> 02:27:26.775]  Ted, thank you for the update.
[02:27:26.815 --> 02:27:27.975]  I really appreciate it.
[02:27:27.995 --> 02:27:31.797]  Yeah, you just print that out, and then call me.
[02:27:31.817 --> 02:27:32.737]  Okay, we're out of time.
[02:27:32.797 --> 02:27:33.097]  Thank you.
[02:27:35.658 --> 02:27:36.598]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.058 --> 02:27:38.579]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.577 --> 02:27:42.339]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.822 --> 02:27:52.125]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:52.445 --> 02:27:57.728]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:27:58.149 --> 02:28:01.150]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:29:53.283 --> 02:29:55.943]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:29:56.383 --> 02:30:02.845]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:31:00.112 --> 02:31:05.295]  Let's go right back to your calls, and I'll recap some of the top stories and get into some other news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:31:05.945 --> 02:31:07.985]  Right now, let's talk to John in Texas.
[02:31:08.085 --> 02:31:09.026]  John, go ahead.
[02:31:09.046 --> 02:31:10.746]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:31:11.086 --> 02:31:11.446]  Hi.
[02:31:11.546 --> 02:31:22.588]  This morning on the news I had that Exxon Chemical Company in Baytown, Texas, which is just about 30 miles east of Houston, about a week ago had a job safety fair there.
[02:31:23.028 --> 02:31:28.770]  They gave 1,000 false Avian flu vaccines, including to the plant manager.
[02:31:29.370 --> 02:31:31.370]  The FBI is investigating.
[02:31:31.810 --> 02:31:35.471]  The FDA is testing the vaccine.
[02:31:36.227 --> 02:31:48.877]  And the plant spokesperson says they're advising their personnel to get tested for blood-borne diseases and that they are very concerned about their employees, Alex.
[02:31:49.237 --> 02:31:51.199]  What, they gave them some weird vaccine?
[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:55.322]  All they said was a false vaccine.
[02:31:56.423 --> 02:31:57.484]  I don't know what that means.
[02:31:58.925 --> 02:32:01.207]  And who did you say owns the plant?
[02:32:01.908 --> 02:32:02.368]  Exxon.
[02:32:02.808 --> 02:32:03.589]  Exxon Chemical.
[02:32:04.258 --> 02:32:05.258]  Exxon Mobil, huh?
[02:32:05.319 --> 02:32:05.699]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:06.039 --> 02:32:06.359]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:06.499 --> 02:32:08.360]  You can't get any more New World Order than that.
[02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:09.440]  I wonder what they're up to.
[02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:14.002]  I do not know, sir, but I didn't hear you mention that.
[02:32:14.062 --> 02:32:16.783]  It might be in your stack there, but I wanted to bring that up.
[02:32:16.823 --> 02:32:17.964]  No, I had not heard that.
[02:32:18.004 --> 02:32:19.024]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:32:19.044 --> 02:32:19.244]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:19.264 --> 02:32:23.486]  I don't know if it's getting out of Houston here or not, but there's a big concern about it.
[02:32:23.546 --> 02:32:31.930]  Even the plant manager was on the TV today, and, I mean, he looked like a deer in the headlights over this thing because he took one of the shots.
[02:32:33.667 --> 02:32:39.031]  Did they say where the vaccine came from?
[02:32:39.431 --> 02:32:39.831]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:39.851 --> 02:32:49.498]  It was a registered medical contractor that came in to give these shots to the people that wanted them.
[02:32:50.493 --> 02:32:53.275]  And anyway, that's about it.
[02:32:53.315 --> 02:32:54.756]  They didn't say the name of the person.
[02:32:55.336 --> 02:32:57.137]  I'm glad you called about that, John.
[02:32:57.217 --> 02:32:57.718]  Anything else?
[02:32:58.018 --> 02:32:58.858]  No, sir, that's it.
[02:32:59.138 --> 02:33:03.021]  I'll let you know if there's any further developments if they come on with any more of it.
[02:33:03.061 --> 02:33:04.141]  Thanks for the call.
[02:33:04.702 --> 02:33:10.205]  You know, that's a big problem about this bird flu hoax and this bird flu hysteria.
[02:33:11.766 --> 02:33:14.968]  And again, they might have five human cases of it,
[02:33:16.531 --> 02:33:17.932]  In Canada or the U.S.
[02:33:18.012 --> 02:33:30.642]  and it'll be called a pandemic and it'll be called the end of the world and martial law and lockdowns and then oh, nothing will happen and see, martial law kept you safe and now we're all trained that martial law is good.
[02:33:32.364 --> 02:33:35.146]  But one of the other problems is there's all these quacks.
[02:33:36.408 --> 02:33:38.750]  And I'm talking about people selling medical drugs.
[02:33:38.830 --> 02:33:40.271]  I'm talking about prescription drugs.
[02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:46.474]  That Tamiflu, a lot of major medical reports on it that it doesn't really do anything.
[02:33:47.895 --> 02:33:53.319]  And already there's a bunch of scams where people are fighting over it and they're stockpiling.
[02:33:53.379 --> 02:33:56.081]  That's actually in the stack I'm going to get to in a few minutes.
[02:33:57.782 --> 02:33:58.822]  Just really bizarre.
[02:33:59.603 --> 02:34:02.525]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Colorado.
[02:34:02.585 --> 02:34:03.285]  Another John.
[02:34:03.345 --> 02:34:03.986]  Welcome, John.
[02:34:04.006 --> 02:34:05.347]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:05.847 --> 02:34:05.947]  Hi.
[02:34:06.417 --> 02:34:08.278]  That's really great what you're doing.
[02:34:08.598 --> 02:34:34.515]  I was just wondering if you knew anything about DIA, the Denver International Airport, because there's a lot of this Masonic symbols around, and they've got a bunch of New American Century kind of rhetoric on the time capsules and stuff, and they've got a lot of creepy murals around that have images of dead women from certain ethnic groups and stuff.
[02:34:35.310 --> 02:34:41.074]  I was wondering if you knew anything more about that area.
[02:34:41.214 --> 02:34:41.494]  I do.
[02:34:41.854 --> 02:34:43.496]  Are you in a bathroom or something?
[02:34:44.096 --> 02:34:45.837]  Yes, kind of.
[02:34:46.157 --> 02:34:46.718]  Oh, okay.
[02:34:46.798 --> 02:34:48.379]  It's echoing really bad.
[02:34:48.939 --> 02:34:53.743]  Yeah, it's just a little more... Just try getting up closer to your telephone.
[02:34:54.163 --> 02:34:54.463]  Oh, okay.
[02:34:54.643 --> 02:34:55.063]  Does that work?
[02:34:55.424 --> 02:34:57.005]  Yeah, it's kind of becoming like a pet peeve.
[02:34:57.225 --> 02:34:57.605]  I'm sorry.
[02:34:57.645 --> 02:35:00.467]  I just want to be able to actually hear you so everybody else can hear you.
[02:35:00.787 --> 02:35:01.007]  Right.
[02:35:01.628 --> 02:35:02.448]  Yeah, that's wonderful.
[02:35:03.209 --> 02:35:03.909]  Now I can hear you.
[02:35:03.929 --> 02:35:04.530]  Okay.
[02:35:05.788 --> 02:35:14.080]  The Denver International Airport is just a huge satanic amulet.
[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:17.224]  I mean, the whole building is built according to occult lines.
[02:35:17.705 --> 02:35:22.672]  There are giant 20-foot tall murals of Nazi children killing black people.
[02:35:23.434 --> 02:35:29.615]  Of all seeing eyes and pyramid and sacrifices and murders of children and piles of dead babies.
[02:35:30.176 --> 02:35:32.636]  And there's a concentration camp on the airport.
[02:35:32.676 --> 02:35:35.977]  About 60% of the airport is not for the public to get on.
[02:35:36.617 --> 02:35:40.918]  And Denver is the alternate capital if D.C.
[02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:41.718]  is destroyed.
[02:35:41.738 --> 02:35:44.959]  And they've got some weird occultic plan for Denver.
[02:35:45.666 --> 02:35:47.667]  And it is extremely evil.
[02:35:48.147 --> 02:35:54.649]  Yeah, it's really nuts living here because, I mean, when I was growing up, you know, it took a really long time for DIA to build.
[02:35:55.329 --> 02:36:07.152]  You know, they didn't make jokes about it and stuff, and they were trying to blame the amount of time it took to build it on all the baggage claim stuff going wrong.
[02:36:08.007 --> 02:36:09.867]  And, you know, and it's kind of weird... Well, it's well known.
[02:36:09.907 --> 02:36:13.068]  It's got large areas of it that are just shut off with fences around it.
[02:36:13.268 --> 02:36:27.170]  Yeah, and it's got, um... And it's funny, when you're on the terminal in the little subway car, going to the different terminals, you'll see a bunch of different offshoots of these tunnels that go... They span really far, and then you look at the terminal map, and it's a straight line.
[02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:36.692]  And it's just, uh, I mean... And the trains run back and forth, so it doesn't need to, like, turn around or anything, and... You know, so it's just kind of weird, um...
[02:36:38.158 --> 02:36:43.141]  And, you know, I heard it's an underground military base and all this other stuff.
[02:36:43.401 --> 02:36:45.322]  Yeah, no, it's part of continuity of government.
[02:36:45.342 --> 02:36:48.184]  There are underground connections to different bases.
[02:36:48.944 --> 02:36:56.068]  Yeah, and they've got... Yeah, listen, I appreciate the call.
[02:36:56.088 --> 02:36:58.969]  The New World Order loves to just throw it in your face.
[02:37:01.050 --> 02:37:07.514]  And you can type in murals, Denver International Airport, or Denver International Airport satanic,
[02:37:08.419 --> 02:37:16.004]  Type something like that into a search engine, whether it's Yahoo or Google, and you can see a bunch of big photos of it.
[02:37:16.024 --> 02:37:17.765]  It is really scary stuff.
[02:37:18.546 --> 02:37:20.747]  Just really, really bizarre.
[02:37:22.148 --> 02:37:26.090]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul in Ohio.
[02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.811]  Paul, welcome.
[02:37:27.551 --> 02:37:28.192]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:28.852 --> 02:37:29.172]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:29.853 --> 02:37:34.056]  Hey, it's a pleasure to finally speak to a guy that's made all these great videos.
[02:37:34.396 --> 02:37:36.017]  Well, it's good to talk to you.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:39.421]  I want to talk about a few things.
[02:37:40.941 --> 02:37:49.182]  Basically, torrent technology and sharing videos over the internet is really how I got into all this.
[02:37:49.763 --> 02:37:52.963]  It's just a really amazing technology for everyone to use.
[02:37:52.983 --> 02:37:58.904]  I also want to talk, everyone's been talking about the Catholic Church.
[02:37:58.944 --> 02:38:02.445]  You just talked about how there's the underground base in Denver.
[02:38:03.716 --> 02:38:07.357]  And there's some 200 underground bases throughout the world.
[02:38:07.377 --> 02:38:09.297]  Yeah, well, I mean, let's be clear.
[02:38:09.977 --> 02:38:19.699]  There is a hub at the Denver Airport that hooks into the Colorado Springs, Northcom, and into NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain.
[02:38:19.739 --> 02:38:25.460]  So it's kind of the spoke, one of the main spokes inside a whole system.
[02:38:27.180 --> 02:38:30.061]  Yeah, and they use those tunnel boring machines and whatnot, and...
[02:38:30.922 --> 02:38:31.823]  Yeah, that's all admitted.
[02:38:31.843 --> 02:38:33.284]  You know, people always talk about it being secret.
[02:38:33.304 --> 02:38:34.205]  It's not even secret.
[02:38:35.326 --> 02:38:36.868]  Yeah, none of this stuff ever is.
[02:38:36.968 --> 02:38:38.910]  Just like Andy Rooney talking about the chip.
[02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:41.812]  Yeah, we all need to be forced to take it to prove we're good.
[02:38:41.852 --> 02:38:42.273]  Yes, mm-hmm.
[02:38:43.834 --> 02:38:50.521]  A really good video off of Porn, and it's good because it's only like 20 megs, is called Secret Evil of 9-11.
[02:38:51.642 --> 02:38:52.843]  And it has music in it.
[02:38:52.863 --> 02:38:53.984]  It has a little bit of you in it.
[02:38:54.224 --> 02:38:55.145]  You've probably heard about it.
[02:38:55.165 --> 02:38:55.726]  No.
[02:38:57.194 --> 02:38:58.156]  Oh, well, check it out.
[02:38:58.316 --> 02:39:04.064]  Well, for those that don't know, torrent technology is a type of streaming or downloading, right?
[02:39:05.626 --> 02:39:08.330]  Yeah, it's like an evolved version of file sharing.
[02:39:08.903 --> 02:39:13.485]  And it's like these big file-sharing networks where you can go do this, and I encourage that.
[02:39:14.426 --> 02:39:27.412]  Frankly, I don't sell as many videos as I used to, but it doesn't matter, because I can go to some BitTorrent website and see where 10,000 people in the last month have watched martial law.
[02:39:27.953 --> 02:39:30.614]  I can go to a bunch of sites and see where that's happened, but...
[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:37.364]  If you enjoy something and you think it's good watching it over the computer, why not get the original DVD?
[02:39:37.864 --> 02:39:39.585]  Why not get the original VHS?
[02:39:39.605 --> 02:39:47.590]  Or why not go to prisonplanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day membership and then get everything exclusively first?
[02:39:48.010 --> 02:39:48.531]  Sound good to you?
[02:40:13.430 --> 02:40:16.192]  I got a membership to the thing because I think it's a great deal.
[02:40:16.212 --> 02:40:18.273]  You can sign up for just a month.
[02:40:18.373 --> 02:40:24.277]  Oh, and incidentally, our internet provider has been going over now to more cogent bandwidth.
[02:40:25.397 --> 02:40:28.980]  So we end up paying out the nose for it, but then it's not even good.
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:30.841]  So we're moving.
[02:40:31.241 --> 02:40:33.342]  We're going to upgrade to different types of bandwidth.
[02:40:33.362 --> 02:40:34.203]  It's going to cost about...
[02:40:35.154 --> 02:40:37.035]  Three times as much, but c'est la vie.
[02:40:38.035 --> 02:40:43.137]  So in one week, we've been having some slowdowns during peak times for streaming.
[02:40:43.177 --> 02:40:46.578]  You can still download everything, but that problem's going to be fixed very soon.
[02:40:47.859 --> 02:40:48.779]  All right.
[02:40:49.399 --> 02:40:51.880]  Yeah, I wanted to just go over something else real quickly.
[02:40:52.301 --> 02:40:52.541]  Sure.
[02:40:53.361 --> 02:41:01.624]  I've studied a lot of different things like numerology, feng shui, bagua, e-king, 64 hexagrams, stuff like that.
[02:41:01.844 --> 02:41:03.345]  But I also found a thing about...
[02:41:04.602 --> 02:41:15.448]  A 13-month calendar, because the moon orbits the Earth 13 times a year, and our bodies have 13 segments, our ankles, hips, shoulders, and our spine.
[02:41:15.628 --> 02:41:29.795]  Actually, when the pagans took France back over, the Illuminati and the French Revolution, they tried to go to two different models, a 10-day week, and there was an argument they tried to go on to the 13-month calendar.
[02:41:30.775 --> 02:41:32.036]  So, yeah, that was pretty weird.
[02:41:33.294 --> 02:41:40.319]  Yeah, and I don't think it's a coincidence that we're all using the Catholic calendar as a default standard.
[02:41:42.501 --> 02:41:53.929]  Also, there's stuff like turtles have 13 scales on the backs of their shells, Jesus had 12 disciples, King Arthur had 12, Knights of the Round Table.
[02:41:54.510 --> 02:42:01.555]  I really enjoyed when he had David Icke on because a lot of that historical manipulation he shows really, really well.
[02:42:02.771 --> 02:42:15.176]  Well, it is true we had 13 colonies, and it is true there's 13 stripes, and it is true there's 13 stars, and it is true that you've got the Keystone State, and it's true they were Masons, and it's true.
[02:42:15.216 --> 02:42:15.816]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:16.397 --> 02:42:17.757]  But people get confused then.
[02:42:17.797 --> 02:42:20.098]  They go, well, wait a minute, then our founding fathers were evil.
[02:42:20.218 --> 02:42:20.598]  No.
[02:42:21.839 --> 02:42:26.581]  Again, most Masons do not know what they're part of.
[02:42:26.681 --> 02:42:31.643]  Most Masons don't know that somewhere along the line, and some say from the start,
[02:42:32.685 --> 02:42:39.528]  The Babylon slash Egyptian mystery schools, the dark magicians as they were called, got control of those.
[02:42:40.689 --> 02:42:45.251]  And so they created degrees above the 33rd degree.
[02:42:46.952 --> 02:42:49.033]  Above the 33rd degree of Solomon's Temple.
[02:42:50.514 --> 02:42:51.234]  The Great Builder.
[02:42:53.375 --> 02:42:55.216]  And their masons, hence Great Builder.
[02:42:56.650 --> 02:43:03.034]  And so George Washington, their published letters he wrote decrying the takeover of the lodges by the Illuminati.
[02:43:03.094 --> 02:43:11.600]  I mean, you can say the Illuminati was there in the lodges before that, but that's when they really took it over and dominated it.
[02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:16.683]  To the point of where John Quincy Adams and people were actually hunting them down.
[02:43:17.423 --> 02:43:19.145]  But they don't like to advertise that.
[02:43:19.525 --> 02:43:22.707]  You hear about Salem witch trials, which was ridiculous.
[02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:27.132]  And was truly a witch hunt in the purest sense of the cliché.
[02:43:27.792 --> 02:43:29.993]  But you don't hear about the hunts for masons.
[02:43:31.054 --> 02:43:33.875]  Oh, the masons know all about it, though.
[02:43:34.116 --> 02:43:35.016]  The high-level ones do.
[02:43:35.076 --> 02:43:36.717]  But it's just part of history.
[02:43:37.397 --> 02:43:39.638]  John Quincy Adams banned the Illuminati.
[02:43:40.479 --> 02:43:41.559]  They were hunting them down.
[02:43:41.579 --> 02:43:43.921]  They were executing them because they were caught killing people.
[02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:46.282]  They were caught trying to take the government over.
[02:43:47.983 --> 02:43:51.124]  And so we forget that that happened, but that's part of our history.
[02:43:51.144 --> 02:43:52.005]  We had a president...
[02:43:53.975 --> 02:43:58.897]  Who got elected on an anti-Masonic party and they were hunting them down.
[02:43:59.457 --> 02:44:02.458]  Because regardless of what you think about Masons, it is a good old boy club.
[02:44:02.478 --> 02:44:03.458]  They do help each other.
[02:44:04.079 --> 02:44:05.239]  They do collude.
[02:44:05.839 --> 02:44:07.520]  And that's not good for a free republic.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:16.202]  To have people combining their strengths and combining their forces and business and everything covertly is part of a conspiracy.
[02:44:17.843 --> 02:44:17.923]  And
[02:44:19.361 --> 02:44:23.462]  Frankly, I mean, I love my Uncle Houston, even though he died when I was about four years old.
[02:44:23.762 --> 02:44:24.442]  I remember him.
[02:44:24.522 --> 02:44:25.082]  Nice fella.
[02:44:28.803 --> 02:44:31.123]  But I've told the story, and he told my dad.
[02:44:31.723 --> 02:44:37.324]  Back during Prohibition, he ran a bunch of bars for the German-slash-Irish mob in Texas.
[02:44:37.804 --> 02:44:41.545]  Some of the wealthiest families in Austin made their money off of booze running.
[02:44:41.565 --> 02:44:44.205]  But he was just a mid-level guy out in Houston.
[02:44:44.445 --> 02:44:48.646]  Uncle Houston, and he was from Houston, or lived in Houston.
[02:44:49.918 --> 02:44:53.940]  And he shot, what was it, two people killed him?
[02:44:55.181 --> 02:44:58.743]  And he went in and flashed the Masonic sign, and they were trying to rob him.
[02:45:00.543 --> 02:45:04.185]  But he didn't even have to have it go to a jury or go through preliminary trials.
[02:45:04.205 --> 02:45:05.766]  He just flashed Mason in distress.
[02:45:06.246 --> 02:45:11.329]  The judge just instantly let him go.
[02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:17.132]  And my Uncle Houston told my dad, he didn't even know the judge, he didn't even know he was a Mason, though most judges at that time...
[02:45:17.828 --> 02:45:27.852]  Even more so than today were Masons, and it was just, there was no discussion, there was no why he was doing it, there was just, instantly, case dismissed, you're out of here, go.
[02:45:29.933 --> 02:45:32.974]  And that's a power that you're not supposed to have, folks.
[02:45:33.014 --> 02:45:34.475]  That just asks for corruption.
[02:45:34.515 --> 02:45:37.076]  That just begs for corruption.
[02:45:37.096 --> 02:45:47.260]  I mean, even if all the Masons are wonderful little sweetie pies, then that made it a perfect vehicle for the Illuminati to take it over, and then
[02:45:48.146 --> 02:45:52.730]  Basically have an intelligence agency that already controlled the government.
[02:45:54.512 --> 02:45:55.933]  And, I mean, let's be frank, folks.
[02:45:56.473 --> 02:45:58.175]  The Illuminati didn't take over the Masons.
[02:45:59.396 --> 02:46:03.199]  The Masons grew into the Illuminati, and then they just merged back together.
[02:46:03.259 --> 02:46:07.163]  It's like a... Oh, it's just insane.
[02:46:07.563 --> 02:46:08.264]  It's out of control.
[02:46:09.384 --> 02:46:14.327]  I could babble about that all day long, but that's dangerous to our society.
[02:46:14.367 --> 02:46:16.688]  These good old boy clubs and all the things they do.
[02:46:16.768 --> 02:46:18.269]  It stifles development.
[02:46:18.829 --> 02:46:20.050]  It stifles dissent.
[02:46:20.690 --> 02:46:23.052]  It stifles the free flow of information.
[02:46:23.532 --> 02:46:24.933]  It stifles civilization.
[02:46:25.353 --> 02:46:26.734]  And Masons will tell you, what do you mean?
[02:46:26.774 --> 02:46:28.535]  We are civilization, buddy.
[02:46:30.156 --> 02:46:37.180]  And yes, we do owe a lot of our technological development to the Masons.
[02:46:38.749 --> 02:46:40.910]  Because they were the construction guilds.
[02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:42.971]  They were the secret universities.
[02:46:43.892 --> 02:46:48.734]  In the past, the Masons were predominantly mathematicians and builders.
[02:46:49.515 --> 02:46:50.455]  Cathedral builders.
[02:46:51.336 --> 02:46:53.037]  They built the big cathedrals in Europe.
[02:46:55.698 --> 02:46:57.679]  But they are not the Masons you see today.
[02:46:58.439 --> 02:47:03.362]  And then there was always some occultic mumbo-jumbo involved because it went right back to Egypt.
[02:47:04.396 --> 02:47:09.558]  So it's going to have that connected to it, but it's gone downhill very, very quickly.
[02:47:10.218 --> 02:47:19.400]  And I'm not talking about masons who go to the lodge and, you know, grill steaks once a week and play pool and watch TV.
[02:47:21.501 --> 02:47:27.502]  I'm talking about high-level masons, ladies and gentlemen, which most masons don't even know exist.
[02:47:31.564 --> 02:47:32.784]  We've got a new hurricane...
[02:47:33.689 --> 02:47:38.192]  Betta threatens islands, Nicaragua's eastern coast.
[02:47:38.212 --> 02:47:45.316]  A tropical storm, they're saying, will probably become a Category 1 hurricane or higher and is headed for the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua.
[02:47:45.336 --> 02:47:48.358]  So it's just super record season.
[02:47:49.859 --> 02:47:59.345]  And yes, you know that Dick Cheney's people stabbed Scooter Libby five counts in the indictment for perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements.
[02:47:59.975 --> 02:48:08.438]  Negroponte, the horrible torture lord, is unveiling huge domestic spy agencies to spy on the American people and folks worldwide.
[02:48:08.498 --> 02:48:09.718]  So really scary.
[02:48:09.738 --> 02:48:12.779]  The death squads are coming to America.
[02:48:14.379 --> 02:48:18.220]  When we get back, I will get into some of this other news here.
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:18.280]  U.S.
[02:48:19.341 --> 02:48:23.522]  hoarding drops flu pill maker, the Holt Supply.
[02:48:24.483 --> 02:48:33.487]  Doctors ask government about Tamiflu, and a really scary article, genetic map that could unlock the secrets of human life.
[02:48:33.987 --> 02:48:34.728]  Ah, yes.
[02:48:35.748 --> 02:48:38.449]  It's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:43.212]  Please stay with us, and don't forget InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:49:01.341 --> 02:49:05.503]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:05.743 --> 02:49:08.585]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.685 --> 02:49:13.327]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[02:50:55.169 --> 02:51:01.538]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.858 --> 02:51:02.498]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.403 --> 02:51:17.803]  We're good to go.
[02:52:05.382 --> 02:52:13.989]  Look at this article.
[02:52:17.072 --> 02:52:19.895]  Drill will test city for flu emergency.
[02:52:20.015 --> 02:52:20.575]  Portsmouth.
[02:52:21.436 --> 02:52:26.200]  The city will be one of three regional sites next month holding an emergency vaccination exercise.
[02:52:26.621 --> 02:52:28.262]  A forced vaccination drill, by the way.
[02:52:28.683 --> 02:52:31.265]  Test preparedness in case of a disease outbreak.
[02:52:31.883 --> 02:52:32.844]  Martial law, folks.
[02:52:32.864 --> 02:52:43.091]  The drill is part of a plan developed in 2001 by emergency officials in Portsmouth Regional Hospital in the wake of the anthrax scare, which is admittedly a federal government attack, folks.
[02:52:43.491 --> 02:52:44.372]  Yes, that was the government.
[02:52:44.972 --> 02:52:53.438]  During the exercise, 2,000 residents of Portsmouth and four other towns can get actual flu vaccinations to test the region's readiness for a real event.
[02:52:54.259 --> 02:52:55.520]  Just unbelievable.
[02:52:57.641 --> 02:53:04.606]  Continuing here, they're now admitting that a bunch of the supposed new cases in China and France turned out to be false alarms.
[02:53:04.626 --> 02:53:18.536]  Drug maker Roche halted supplies of his Tamiflu pill to the United States on Thursday to head off hoarding by consumers fearing bird flu, but two suspected human cases in China and France turned out to be false alarms.
[02:53:18.656 --> 02:53:20.097]  Oh, they don't want hoarding.
[02:53:20.237 --> 02:53:23.560]  They did it to artificially create scarcity and drive a panic.
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:25.201]  That made the price go up.
[02:53:26.064 --> 02:53:26.384]  Who knows?
[02:53:26.424 --> 02:53:27.685]  They get it to stop that.
[02:53:28.045 --> 02:53:29.647]  Oh, but it had the opposite effect.
[02:53:29.807 --> 02:53:30.447]  Oh, oh.
[02:53:31.448 --> 02:53:32.429]  Just unbelievable.
[02:53:33.109 --> 02:53:34.670]  And here's a really scary article.
[02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:37.832]  Genetic map that could unlock secrets of human life.
[02:53:38.673 --> 02:53:47.539]  The National Geographic and the World Health Organization in conjunction went all over the world two years ago and got blood samples from every human group.
[02:53:47.639 --> 02:53:53.864]  And then we have Dick Cheney admittedly saying that they want to create race-specific bioweapons to kill certain races.
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:59.023]  In his September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defense's PNAC article, he wrote.
[02:53:59.483 --> 02:54:01.485]  Yes, he calls for using genetic weapons.
[02:54:02.505 --> 02:54:13.973]  The first genetic map of human diversity, oh, but it's a diversity, so it's good, is published today by scientists who describe it as a landmark achievement that will revolutionize medicine.
[02:54:14.093 --> 02:54:14.433]  I bet.
[02:54:15.234 --> 02:54:19.757]  More than 2,200 researchers from six countries have spent three years and more than
[02:54:20.610 --> 02:54:26.976]  80 million pounds, deconstructing the human genome to discover the precise genetic differences between people.
[02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:30.118]  They've traveled the world to gain this information.
[02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:36.404]  Yes, I'm sure it'll be put to really, really, really good use.
[02:54:36.804 --> 02:54:39.827]  CBS News reports, county takes on illegal immigrants.
[02:54:40.888 --> 02:54:47.033]  They are up before dawn in the choking dust of the potato harvest in the vast farm fields and on the construction sites.
[02:54:47.617 --> 02:54:52.778]  They are Idaho's laborers, all, but the mean, the mean county.
[02:54:53.219 --> 02:54:58.760]  They are mostly Hispanic, mainly from Mexico, and despite their back-breaking work, they're not entirely welcome.
[02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:02.521]  CBS News correspondent Delia Asaris reports.
[02:55:02.981 --> 02:55:11.984]  And then it goes into how the county is leading the charge against illegal immigration influx is Caton County Commissioner Robert Vasquez.
[02:55:13.084 --> 02:55:14.925]  It's an economic attack on the United States.
[02:55:15.005 --> 02:55:18.487]  Vasquez, who is a Mexican heritage, explains, I've got to get him on.
[02:55:18.827 --> 02:55:22.289]  Yeah, it shuts down, drives down housing prices, everything.
[02:55:22.329 --> 02:55:27.492]  Folks, some areas it drives them down, some areas it drives them up, and some areas it just fries everything.
[02:55:28.172 --> 02:55:31.714]  But as Vasquez likes to point out, his grandmother came to the United States legally.
[02:55:32.314 --> 02:55:34.976]  Vasquez says illegal workers cost the county millions of dollars.
[02:55:35.696 --> 02:55:38.978]  In a legal first, he is turning to the courts to get the money back.
[02:55:41.923 --> 02:55:42.984]  I've got to get him on.
[02:55:43.384 --> 02:55:47.908]  Look for Vasquez to be on next week.
[02:55:47.968 --> 02:55:48.548]  Here's another one.
[02:55:48.568 --> 02:55:52.832]  Texas Company hired illegal aliens to make MREs.
[02:55:53.492 --> 02:55:55.834]  I'm sorry all the callers didn't have time to get to some of you.
[02:55:55.874 --> 02:55:57.655]  Call me back Monday.
[02:55:58.256 --> 02:56:00.878]  Call me back next week.
