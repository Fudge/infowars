[00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.106]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:08.826]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:10.647]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:12.127]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:13.787]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:18.369]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:33.513]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am roaring to go.
[00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:36.532]  Hope you are as well.
[00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.715]  It is Monday, the 7th day of February 2005.
[00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.298]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.341]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.744]  We have a surprise guest scheduled in 30 minutes.
[00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.629]  One of those surprise guests that we don't talk about until they're here on air with us.
[00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:59.771]  That's just part of the surprise.
[00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:02.453]  Then in the second hour...
[00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:11.229]  We're going to have Gordon Prather, who writes for WorldNetDaily and AntiWar.com, of all places.
[00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.232]  Quite a combination, talking about the war and Iran, and are they going to invade Iran, or is it really on hold?
[00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:21.253]  What's really happening?
[00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:24.093]  In the meantime, CIA to...
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.641]  Meet on release of Nazi papers.
[00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:32.642]  They've already released some of them under congressional orders.
[00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:35.103]  Finally, the Congress growing some backbone.
[00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:39.224]  Normally, they're just rubber stamps of the executive and the bureaucracy.
[00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:52.808]  And it turns out that we've got Adolf Eichmann and Reinhard Gehlen and all these top Nazis protected in Germany, in the U.S.,
[00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:55.408]  Right through to today.
[00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:57.769]  Of course, almost all of them are dead now.
[00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.752]  But their money was protected, and we know who protected it.
[00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:19.683]  The Dulles brothers, the Bush family and others got large percentages of the diamonds, of the gold, for protecting it and getting it into Houston, Texas, Midland, Texas, Argentine...
[00:02:20.638 --> 00:02:23.339]  Down there in Guatemala, Latin America.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.281]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.041]  We'll be going over it.
[00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:29.023]  And some good news here.
[00:02:29.123 --> 00:02:32.324]  New Hampshire introduces resolution to get U.S.
[00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:33.365]  out of U.N.
[00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:44.831]  Now, days before 9-11, the state of New Hampshire was about to pull out of the union itself because of, quote, the police state and the New World Order.
[00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:54.751]  And I had mayors and members of the State House on the broadcast the week before 9-11 as New Hampshire was about to pull out of the Union.
[00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:57.193]  This is very serious.
[00:02:57.233 --> 00:02:58.413]  We'll be talking about it.
[00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:04.197]  Also, Arizona Sheriff orders fingerprinting when traffic citations issue.
[00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:14.064]  Now, simultaneously in the last month and a half, I've seen probably 20 different news articles from Green Bay, Wisconsin,
[00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:16.298]  Tampa, Florida.
[00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.940]  Dallas, Texas.
[00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:21.342]  Los Angeles, California.
[00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:30.970]  Now, it's out of Phoenix, Arizona, and the usual suspect, Mr. Arpaio, Sheriff Arpaio, who we've interviewed many times.
[00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.591]  Boy, what a character.
[00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:35.254]  Not afraid to come on and defend his sickening ideas.
[00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:36.655]  We're going to get him back on.
[00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.916]  Mr. Arpaio...
[00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:50.073]  The guy that makes the inmates basically dress in women's clothes and has video cameras on them in their cells so people can watch them on the internet and laugh at them, and he charges for it, too.
[00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:52.834]  Quite the sicko.
[00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:59.898]  Well, I mean, he's joining into this federally funded program of thumb scanners in the cars, and you get pulled over for any reason.
[00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:06.721]  And if you're given a parking ticket, whatever, you are thumb scanned, and it goes into the database.
[00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:08.662]  We'll tell you why this is so dangerous.
[00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:16.079]  Plus, Utah troopers learned to draw blood from suspects on the side of the highway.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.261]  Because it says they don't want to take them to the hospital.
[00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:20.722]  I mean, that would be too lengthy.
[00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:22.683]  We'll just take your blood on the highway.
[00:04:22.703 --> 00:04:27.226]  And that meshes nicely with this Bennington Banner news article.
[00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.308]  Drug-sniffing dog makes a score!
[00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.691]  The child was ordered to be on Ritalin by the school.
[00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:42.060]  And then when he was caught with it in an expired bottle, even though it was a current prescription, he's going on probation.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.682]  See, fun enough to get you into the psychiatric system.
[00:04:45.282 --> 00:04:47.624]  Now we'll get you into the criminal justice system.
[00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:52.648]  I can't tell you how many times I've seen old ladies, you know, they put their pills in a little case.
[00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:59.373]  When they go out, are sent to jail for having prescription drugs without the bottle.
[00:04:59.573 --> 00:05:00.774]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:01.214]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.747]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:10.449]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.872]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.094]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:20.299]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.664]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:25.365]  We're good to go.
[00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:43.504]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the InfoWars.
[00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:45.066]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:45.466]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:48.028]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:49.289]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:04.546]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.586 --> 00:06:08.789]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.811]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:14.412]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:23.237]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:24.778]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:29.121]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:31.183]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:43.393]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:50.138]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:53.501]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:00.806 --> 00:07:05.027]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:07:05.788 --> 00:07:14.050]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:16.371]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:23.053]  While you listen, verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:25.254]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:27.935]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:07:28.524 --> 00:07:30.545]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:32.205]  And it's so easy.
[00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:34.946]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:36.406]  When you want.
[00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:37.587]  Where you want.
[00:07:38.387 --> 00:07:43.408]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:46.769]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:47.809]  1-800-419-WORD That's 419-W-O-R-D 1-800-419-WORD
[00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:07.118]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.839]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:10.659]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.299 --> 00:08:12.119]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.740]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.081]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:22.681]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.648 --> 00:08:40.755]  All right, my friends, we're now 8 minutes 30 seconds into this first hour, second segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:46.080]  We've got a surprise guest coming up in about 25 minutes that, believe me, you do not want to miss.
[00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:51.765]  It's concerning the police drawing your blood at roadside checkpoints.
[00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:58.451]  Then we have a guest coming on to talk about, are we going into Iran and Syria in the next year or two?
[00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:00.096]  We're good to go.
[00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:01.237]  We're good to go.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:32.463]  Taxpayers cannot be compelled by the IRS to turn over personal and private property to the IRS absent a federal court order.
[00:09:33.643 --> 00:09:36.704]  Now, this is good news, and I've been talking about this for a long time.
[00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:48.928]  How does the IRS take your bank account without ever charging you or taking you to court, without a jury of your peers finding you guilty, much less even a kangaroo federal judge?
[00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:50.989]  They don't even have a kangaroo court ruling.
[00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:51.589]  They just do it.
[00:09:53.385 --> 00:10:03.772]  How do they come and just seize your house and order the local police, who by the way don't have to follow those orders if the sheriff doesn't let them into town, come to your house and take it without an order?
[00:10:04.232 --> 00:10:05.153]  How do they do this?
[00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:06.954]  They just do it through color of law.
[00:10:07.555 --> 00:10:10.797]  There's been several rulings in the last two weeks.
[00:10:10.857 --> 00:10:17.141]  Another one said that, well, when you fill out your tax forms, it's violating your Fifth Amendment.
[00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:33.073]  Again, how do the police catch somebody with a bloody axe in their hand and, you know, confession letters of how he chopped up women, and this is an actual case, but they can't compel the person to talk because of the Fifth Amendment, which protects us all.
[00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:38.858]  You've got to protect the scumbag, the demon, because everybody will lose their rights if you don't.
[00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:45.303]  And overall, throughout history, it shows it's better to protect their rights than for all of us to lose our rights.
[00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:47.205]  So how are they able to do this?
[00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:50.648]  Well, federal courts are ruling that they can't.
[00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:54.297]  Now, all the other federal rulings are horrible.
[00:10:54.437 --> 00:11:04.962]  That there's no Fourth Amendment, against illegal search and seizure, that they can take your property without just compensation, they can secretly arrest you, all of this stuff.
[00:11:05.322 --> 00:11:08.463]  But meanwhile, the tax rulings are against the IRS.
[00:11:08.523 --> 00:11:09.503]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:15.326]  They predicted this a long time ago, and Catherine Albrecht from Harvard talked about this last week with us.
[00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.372]  What's happening is they're getting ready to scrap the income tax.
[00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:28.516]  And before you jump up sharing, you know, it's like getting rid of one cancer and finding out you've got ten other cancers.
[00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:31.458]  It's pretty bad, folks.
[00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:35.400]  It's the National ID Card National Sales Tax.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.242]  So I'll get into that again a little bit today.
[00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:42.487]  And of course, more of these mixed signals, as I was saying, got a guest coming up about that.
[00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:49.134]  Rumsfeld saying, I ran years away from nuclear weapon, but a month ago he said they've already got nuclear weapons.
[00:11:49.194 --> 00:11:52.538]  So, choose which Rumsfeld you want to believe.
[00:11:52.998 --> 00:11:57.503]  Also, IBM, Sony, Toshiba to reveal super brain chip.
[00:11:57.544 --> 00:11:58.485]  That's the headline.
[00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:05.928]  From the Financial Times of London, announced yesterday that they would announce it later this afternoon from Austin, Texas.
[00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:15.731]  So they made an announcement yesterday of the announcement later today from Austin of this super chip that is five times faster than anything else known.
[00:12:17.372 --> 00:12:22.034]  It's amazing, and it's basically going to put a bunch of people out of business is what they're saying.
[00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:32.693]  A bunch of different companies are in deep, deep trouble with this consortium led by IBM merging with Sony and Toshiba.
[00:12:34.134 --> 00:12:37.317]  So we'll cover that for you as well.
[00:12:38.378 --> 00:12:50.287]  Hundreds are protesting alleged voting irregularities in Iraq and clashes in Iraq have intensified and more and more election complaints are now emerging.
[00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:51.248]  U.S.
[00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:53.210]  redesigning atomic weapons
[00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:54.630]  Interesting.
[00:12:54.670 --> 00:13:00.753]  Going backwards from hydrogen to atomic, or perhaps this New York Times writer just doesn't know what they're talking about.
[00:13:01.353 --> 00:13:10.297]  And plus, critics question NASA on safety of the shuttles before the shuttle is planned to go back into space.
[00:13:11.198 --> 00:13:16.120]  And we'll also talk about Bush's $2.5 trillion budget plan cuts many programs.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:23.503]  Well, of course he's got to cut many programs, because, well, $2.4 trillion is now missing from the Pentagon.
[00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:28.162]  This is out of Heratz, one of the big papers in Israel.
[00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:33.544]  Documents reveal CIA recruited five of Eichmann's associates.
[00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:48.688]  The CIA, despite congressional laws and orders, has been refusing for four years, excuse me, since 1999, four and a half years, to release thousands of pages of documents about Nazis in America.
[00:13:49.375 --> 00:14:01.093]  And they're still refusing to release all of them, but they did release some over the weekend to the nonprofit congressional body, the National Security Archive.
[00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:05.039]  The same folks that released Operation Northwoods in...
[00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:09.412]  April of 2001, the official U.S.
[00:14:09.452 --> 00:14:13.713]  government plan to carry out 9-11, released before 9-11.
[00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:14.473]  Oh, don't believe me?
[00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:19.554]  This type of Operation Northwoods into a search engine, the National Security Archives is one of the top links.
[00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:25.115]  Actually, my website is, but then under that you'll see the National Security Archives there.
[00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:27.536]  Operation Northwoods, official government website.
[00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:34.017]  But the latest stuff you can go read is about Adolf Eichmann, a very nice person.
[00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:42.914]  Because they say Arnold's nice, who says he admires Hitler and hands out records of Hitler and supposedly walks around and sees highlings saying he dreams of being a dictator.
[00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:46.276]  So why not give Eichmann an ADL award?
[00:14:46.356 --> 00:14:52.600]  I mean, you're giving Arnold awards, who says he doesn't care if Kurt Waldheim's a Nazi, that he, quote, loves him and campaigns for him.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.501]  So why is Eichmann in trouble?
[00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:58.904]  Perhaps the CIA should be given an ADL award.
[00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:13.389]  Documents reveal CIA recruited five of Eichmann's associates, five of Adolf Eichmann's Nazi assistants were recruited and employed by the Central Intelligence Agency after World War II.
[00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:27.617]  According to recently declassified intelligence documents, the information came to light after a lengthy battle waged by the non-profit group, the National Security Archive, whose goal is to expose government documents under the framework of the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.999]  The newly released documents are based...
[00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:39.864]  On internal investigations in the CIA's history department, the agency has steadfastly refused to make the documents public for fear they would cause embarrassment.
[00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:46.867]  And here's another one from CNN's CIA to meet on release of Nazi papers.
[00:15:47.787 --> 00:15:49.988]  And the CIA officials, again, they haven't released them yet.
[00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:50.949]  They released a few pages.
[00:15:51.799 --> 00:16:00.966]  We'll meet today, that's Monday, with a government working group in an attempt to resolve whether more records detailing ties between former Nazis and U.S.
[00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:02.407]  intelligence should be made public.
[00:16:02.807 --> 00:16:03.068]  Okay.
[00:16:03.848 --> 00:16:19.580]  From the 50 guests I've interviewed on this subject from Inside Sources, we'd already talked about this years ago, it's been in a bunch of books, about Adolf Eichmann and Reinhard Galen and others.
[00:16:20.302 --> 00:16:21.162]  It's now in the news.
[00:16:21.202 --> 00:16:22.543]  We've talked about this countless times.
[00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:23.823]  There's a bunch of books on the subject.
[00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:26.884]  We know why they don't want to release this.
[00:16:27.084 --> 00:16:35.727]  They don't want people knowing that Dulles and his brother, the head of the CIA, they don't want people knowing that Prescott Bush...
[00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.457]  Made money off this.
[00:16:38.637 --> 00:16:41.458]  Folks, it wasn't just about protecting the Nazis.
[00:16:42.038 --> 00:16:48.362]  They didn't just protect a bunch of the top Nazis to get their dossiers from the Eastern Front with the Ruskies, which was a big part of it.
[00:16:48.702 --> 00:16:49.742]  That was the rationale.
[00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:56.806]  It was about literal, understand me, literal train cars of diamonds.
[00:16:58.227 --> 00:17:01.228]  Because the Germans raided the storehouses in Paris.
[00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:05.130]  The French weren't able to ship out of there to Dunkirk.
[00:17:06.767 --> 00:17:20.775]  Literal warehouses full of Leonardo da Vinci's and Rembrandt's and Monet's, just the whole scale of it, of art.
[00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:28.139]  Literal salt mines full of just hundreds of statues.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.081]  We're talking about the equivalent in trillions today.
[00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:34.943]  I mean, the Nazis looted Europe.
[00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:37.750]  They were amazing.
[00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.971]  They blackmailed people in the U.S.
[00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:41.792]  who had German families in Germany.
[00:17:43.553 --> 00:17:56.300]  My grandfather, who was German, German-American, lived across the street from a famous inventor who my grandfather even collaborated with and made an invention for the Pentagon.
[00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:05.605]  And my grandfather told the story of watching this guy who was worth millions literally pay out almost everything he had quietly back to Germany.
[00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:09.691]  Because the family he had over there would have been killed if he didn't.
[00:18:10.532 --> 00:18:12.254]  This is the type of stuff the Nazis did.
[00:18:13.855 --> 00:18:16.417]  And it's just amazing.
[00:18:17.738 --> 00:18:19.460]  Absolutely amazing to watch this.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.442]  So you wonder why the Bushes are so powerful.
[00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:25.825]  You wonder how they just came from nowhere after World War II.
[00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:34.833]  Well, they were one of the chief families for Fritz Thyssen and Flick and others.
[00:18:35.862 --> 00:18:36.502]  And it's admitted.
[00:18:36.522 --> 00:18:38.183]  The documents are at the Library of Congress.
[00:18:38.203 --> 00:18:39.083]  This has been made public.
[00:18:39.564 --> 00:18:44.045]  London Guardian now, you know, not just the stuff like the New Hampshire Gazette.
[00:18:46.406 --> 00:18:47.547]  UPI, you name it.
[00:18:48.807 --> 00:18:53.189]  Billions and billions and billions in Nazi gold.
[00:18:54.489 --> 00:18:55.370]  Diamonds.
[00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.690]  You name it.
[00:18:57.851 --> 00:19:00.892]  Artwork coming into Texas, coming into Latin America.
[00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:07.644]  And certain families got large cuts of the booty, of the goodies.
[00:19:08.924 --> 00:19:19.569]  And the Bushes are being sued in Germany over their Auschwitz profits, being on the board of directors of Brown Brother Harriman and a couple other companies.
[00:19:20.449 --> 00:19:24.170]  So you wonder why at Skull and Bones they're into Nazi death cult stuff.
[00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.451]  You wonder why they love Arnold.
[00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:27.092]  You wonder what's going on here.
[00:19:27.112 --> 00:19:29.993]  It's now come out that Karl Rove's grandfather...
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.363]  Was a gowl lighter over an entire state in Germany and a propaganda chief directly under Goebbels?
[00:19:36.423 --> 00:19:45.427]  I mean, if you wrote a Philip K. Dick science fiction book like this, he did write one like this with the Nazis take over later, called The Man in the High Tower.
[00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:47.607]  I mean, it wouldn't be this bizarre.
[00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:54.190]  So you wonder where their trillions in today's money, billion in 1945 money, you wonder where it all went?
[00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.891]  Well, it went into what you're now seeing.
[00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.612]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:19:58.212 --> 00:19:59.773]  Please stay with us, Infowars.com.

[00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:07.440]  The real money folks.
[00:21:10.743 --> 00:21:12.644]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.146]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.607]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:16.087]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:16.668 --> 00:21:19.010]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.292]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:37.610]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:41.273]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:21:41.813 --> 00:21:46.957]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.258 --> 00:21:52.201]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:21:52.881 --> 00:21:55.824]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:57.665]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.825 --> 00:22:05.829]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:14.999]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:20.005]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:22:20.445 --> 00:22:27.168]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:22:27.568 --> 00:22:39.374]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:44.298]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:46.820]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:22:50.062 --> 00:22:51.523]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:51.543 --> 00:22:52.604]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:02.077 --> 00:23:04.439]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.524]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:23:08.844 --> 00:23:09.665]  Read the labels.
[00:23:10.085 --> 00:23:14.229]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:14.449 --> 00:23:18.634]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:23.879]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:27.820]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.362]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:33.642 --> 00:23:36.383]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:37.563]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:37.863 --> 00:23:48.586]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:23:48.966 --> 00:23:50.387]  Call Cal Bend Poll Free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:23:50.407 --> 00:23:51.428]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:38.298]  Now, again, it's admitted that these billions and billions and billions and billions and trillions of today's numbers, the Nazi war chest, the Nazi nest eggs, were brought into this country and then that the CIA allowed top Nazis to buy passage, basically, into this nation.
[00:24:40.781 --> 00:24:41.381]  And now, in...
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:49.986]  Multiple Latin American countries, the top families, even leaders of those nations, people who become president, have been German.
[00:24:50.146 --> 00:24:53.589]  And they're openly the sons and daughters of Nazis.
[00:24:54.690 --> 00:25:05.018]  But much of that money went into the CIA's black budget in this country, the CIA that was founded in 1947, you know it as the OSS before that, and into private families' coffers.
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.243]  And so of course the CIA doesn't want you
[00:25:11.078 --> 00:25:12.419]  To have these documents.
[00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:17.601]  Now, hundreds of thousands of pages have been declassified.
[00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:18.321]  Excuse me.
[00:25:18.761 --> 00:25:26.084]  Over a million pages of documents have been declassified about the Nazis and the rat line and the different projects coming into this country.
[00:25:27.204 --> 00:25:28.665]  It'd make for a great movie, wouldn't it?
[00:25:28.705 --> 00:25:31.686]  Somebody ought to make that movie, but don't look for Hollywood to do that.
[00:25:33.007 --> 00:25:38.689]  But there are tens of thousands of other pages, and believe me, they're in there shredding these things down.
[00:25:39.401 --> 00:25:51.388]  In overdrive right now, because this will embarrass many of the most wealthy families in this country, including some Jewish families that made some money off of this.
[00:25:52.369 --> 00:25:53.309]  It's despicable.
[00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:03.296]  But you see the Nazification of America, the police state mirroring the whole homeland security, the black uniform, the Patriot Act.
[00:26:03.596 --> 00:26:07.278]  Many constitutional scholars have looked at these laws and said that they're
[00:26:08.542 --> 00:26:19.993]  Mirrors of Nazi laws, Nazi police state measures, and that is the devices they're using, the mechanisms of political control they're using.
[00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:22.029]  We're good to go.
[00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:45.809]  At the conclusion of the war, the military made efforts to recruit members of the SS and the Gestapo into its ranks.
[00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:57.314]  Yeah, they helped set up the modern CIA, despite simultaneously waging a campaign of denazification over vanquished Germany, a process which included arresting and trying Nazi war criminals.
[00:26:58.655 --> 00:26:59.915]  Well, it's like Iraq.
[00:27:00.156 --> 00:27:02.997]  Our government puts Saddam in, tells him to invade Kuwait,
[00:27:04.092 --> 00:27:15.121]  Tells him before that to go into Iran, funds him to do it, then goes in, takes him out, and they've reported 98% of the Ba'athist, Saddam's people, have been put back into control.
[00:27:17.122 --> 00:27:19.464]  And it's the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:20.545]  Same thing with the Nazis.
[00:27:22.834 --> 00:27:32.242]  It says the documents reveal in great detail CI efforts to recruit Reinhard Galen, who was the Army Chief Officer for the Eastern Front during the war.
[00:27:32.643 --> 00:27:45.314]  The recruitment involved and evolved into a new intelligence sub-organization known as Galen's Organization, which served as the basis for what would later become West Germany's Foreign Intelligence Service, or the BND.
[00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:53.451]  According to the new findings, Galen's organization appointed a number of Gestapo and SS officials.
[00:27:53.531 --> 00:28:01.276]  Galen and his senior associates secretly operated out of the building with the knowledge of the American occupation forces.
[00:28:01.676 --> 00:28:05.419]  And again, helped set up what was the modern West German government.
[00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.392]  And it goes on and on.
[00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:17.037]  If you want to go read these articles or just type in new Nazi documents into a search engine, you'll get scores of articles about it.
[00:28:17.377 --> 00:28:20.760]  And that's just what they've released a few pages.
[00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:25.865]  And they're talking about releasing more today, and we'll follow this as it develops.
[00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:32.110]  But they're not going to release the bulk of them you watch, because we know what's in them.
[00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:39.378]  You've already gotten it from other documents that the Library of Congress inadvertently declassified.
[00:28:39.398 --> 00:28:44.019]  The problems are they have just hundreds of millions of pages of this stuff.
[00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:48.761]  And they're supposed to have people that go and certify it for whether it's good for release or not.
[00:28:49.401 --> 00:28:57.123]  And a lot of times you'll see an Operation Northwoods or something, some really evil document, and it'll have stamped every few years...
[00:28:58.007 --> 00:29:00.868]  You know, reviewed for declassification, don't release.
[00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:02.048]  You'll see the stamps on it.
[00:29:02.468 --> 00:29:03.568]  All the stamps all over it.
[00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:04.668]  Sometimes it's illegible.
[00:29:04.949 --> 00:29:08.489]  The front page, the cover page, there's so many stamps on it.
[00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.210]  But a lot of this stuff does get declassified.
[00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:20.932]  That's why one of Bush's first moves when he got into office was to say, stuff even 80 years old.
[00:29:22.172 --> 00:29:24.333]  And in some cases, even back to 1898, William McKinley said,
[00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:28.239]  In some cases over 106 years old.
[00:29:29.961 --> 00:29:32.182]  None of this is going to be released.
[00:29:33.183 --> 00:29:35.224]  It's all reclassified.
[00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:39.207]  And all presidential papers in perpetuity are classified.
[00:29:39.287 --> 00:29:41.708]  Because they just can't let this stuff leak anymore.
[00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:45.831]  It's becoming too damaging for them, as you can imagine.
[00:29:46.672 --> 00:29:49.193]  Alright, we've got a surprise guest scheduled.
[00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:49.854]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.502 --> 00:29:53.404]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.885 --> 00:29:55.510]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.412 --> 00:29:59.119]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.193 --> 00:30:05.554]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:30:05.814 --> 00:30:06.135]  Why?

[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:10.186]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.446 --> 00:31:14.809]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:24.015]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:32:01.602 --> 00:32:05.283]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:32:05.563 --> 00:32:09.865]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:17.027]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors and soils at the source.
[00:32:17.427 --> 00:32:24.071]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.

[00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:59.282]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:33:02.553 --> 00:33:08.196]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:17.440]  All right, my friends, 33 minutes, 15 seconds into this hour.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.560]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:20.321 --> 00:33:24.163]  Arizona Sheriff orders fingerprinting when traffic citations issued.
[00:33:24.203 --> 00:33:28.645]  And we've seen this again out of Texas, out of Wisconsin, out of California.
[00:33:29.696 --> 00:33:35.298]  And we've had Sheriff Arpaio on before, and when they pull you over, they just go ahead and thumb print you.
[00:33:36.238 --> 00:33:50.582]  And then I've now seen articles, first about two years ago, they put ads in the newspaper in Arizona saying, our officers are going to be there taking blood samples at checkpoints and doing these blotter tests to see if you're on drugs.
[00:33:51.528 --> 00:33:53.409]  I've seen other departments where they're not doing that.
[00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:58.332]  They're just taking you into the police station, into the jail, and doing the blood test.
[00:33:58.352 --> 00:34:02.954]  So now it's not just driving under the influence of alcohol, it's drugs.
[00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:05.536]  And then I have another report here, two today.
[00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:13.466]  One where a little old lady, you know, she didn't put her pills in the prescription container, so she got arrested.
[00:34:13.506 --> 00:34:19.088]  Another where a student ordered to be put on Ritalin, had the Ritalin but not in the right bottle, so he went to jail.
[00:34:19.408 --> 00:34:23.750]  So we're just kind of talking about just a whole wide spectrum of this stuff.
[00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.031]  It's very interesting.
[00:34:25.231 --> 00:34:29.012]  We're honored to be joined during this busy schedule by Sergeant Steve Winward.
[00:34:29.512 --> 00:34:35.155]  He's a state police officer for the great state of Utah, and he's based up in Salt Lake City.
[00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.426]  And we're about to go to him here in just one moment.
[00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:42.348]  Let me just read a few paragraphs of this KUTV TV station text report.
[00:34:43.329 --> 00:34:46.490]  Utah troopers learn to draw blood from suspects.
[00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:54.894]  Some Utah Highway Patrol troopers are becoming medically certified to draw blood from motorists they suspect of driving while intoxicated.
[00:34:55.434 --> 00:34:57.075]  Blood tests are necessary because...
[00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:06.856]  Portable breath test only detects alcohol, not drugs or other possible intoxicants, said Sergeant Lee Perry with Weber County Office of the Highway Patrol.
[00:35:07.668 --> 00:35:18.213]  Without the medical certification, troopers now must either take a suspect to a hospital or call in a certified technician to stick a needle in the suspect's arm and take a small sample.
[00:35:18.773 --> 00:35:21.874]  Every time a trooper does that, it costs the highway patrol $50 to $60.
[00:35:21.914 --> 00:35:23.435]  Perry said that cost about $25,000 per year.
[00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:24.595]  Boy, that's a lot of blood testing.
[00:35:28.357 --> 00:35:33.580]  Eventually, about 65 troopers will be trained throughout the state in the normal medical procedures needed to take blood.
[00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:45.068]  A Federal Highway Safety Administration grant provided the funds to hire the Utah School of Plobotomy, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, to teach troopers how to do it.
[00:35:45.128 --> 00:35:50.431]  And we talked to Beth Anderson, nice lady this morning, and she was kind enough to give us Sergeant Steve Winward.
[00:35:51.192 --> 00:35:52.452]  Sergeant, good to have you on with us.
[00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:53.353]  Thanks.
[00:35:54.746 --> 00:35:56.507]  Just the federal grant.
[00:35:57.368 --> 00:36:01.911]  Tell us about this program and why you're doing this.
[00:36:02.892 --> 00:36:13.419]  Well, what this program is, is we're just training some officers here in the state of Utah, about 65 of them, that will be going through some training to learn to draw blood.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:23.466]  And once they get the training, then they'll be certified through our state toxicology lab to actually draw blood on people that are impaired on drugs other than alcohol.
[00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:29.104]  And the reason why we're doing that is it's kind of a cost-saving feature.
[00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:37.429]  Like the article said, we're being charged anywhere from $50 to $60 for a technician to come and take the blood anyway.
[00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:44.734]  So what we're doing is just training our troopers to do it, that they can do it in a controlled environment when they'll arrest someone for a DUI.
[00:36:45.447 --> 00:36:51.370]  And if the alcohol doesn't affect the impairment, then they'll just take a blood test on the people.
[00:36:51.631 --> 00:36:54.032]  You mean if the alcohol doesn't affect the impairment?
[00:36:54.072 --> 00:36:58.174]  You mean if they're driving erratically, but the alcohol level isn't high?
[00:36:58.194 --> 00:37:02.377]  Yeah, if the alcohol impairment doesn't match, then...
[00:37:03.177 --> 00:37:11.541]  Like if they're impaired, and it's obvious that they're impaired, but when we have an intoxilizer result showing that they're a .00, then we know that there's other substances on board.
[00:37:11.561 --> 00:37:16.703]  So if they're stumbling around, and then you do a blood alcohol, and it's a .8, you're going to do a drug test.
[00:37:17.897 --> 00:37:22.681]  If it's .08, more than likely we'll just go with the blood test.
[00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:23.201]  Yeah, .08.
[00:37:23.301 --> 00:37:25.743]  Yeah, they'd be dead if it was .08.
[00:37:25.883 --> 00:37:27.224]  Yeah, if it was .08.
[00:37:27.264 --> 00:37:28.885]  .08 is our legal limit here in Utah.
[00:37:28.925 --> 00:37:29.806]  That's what I figured.
[00:37:29.846 --> 00:37:32.648]  So if it's .08 or greater, we'd probably just stick with the alcohol.
[00:37:33.188 --> 00:37:43.816]  If it's greater than that or if it's less than that and it's obvious that there's other impairment that will be causing other impairment that doesn't match the alcohol results, then we'll
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:50.665]  We'll have the subject submit to an additional chemical test of a urine or a blood test.
[00:37:51.586 --> 00:37:54.489]  I also heard of some departments getting a piece of hair.
[00:37:55.009 --> 00:37:55.850]  Why not do hair?
[00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:56.731]  That's less intrusive.
[00:37:58.232 --> 00:38:00.274]  I guess that doesn't show time of use.
[00:38:00.574 --> 00:38:02.115]  It would just show a seven-year history.
[00:38:03.196 --> 00:38:05.478]  Yeah, hair is just a history of use.
[00:38:05.538 --> 00:38:08.321]  It doesn't show the use that it's actually at right now.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:19.143]  You know, it doesn't show what they're impaired on at the moment, but it'll show, you know, they may have had some drugs in their system a week or two ago, depending on where they cut their hair at.
[00:38:20.584 --> 00:38:25.406]  Well, let me just say this to you, Sergeant Steve Wenward of the Utah State Police.
[00:38:25.566 --> 00:38:33.488]  You sound like a nice fellow, you came on the show, but let me be devil's advocate here, or kind of founding father advocate.
[00:38:34.549 --> 00:38:34.749]  Look,
[00:38:35.968 --> 00:38:38.311]  Number one, you know this well.
[00:38:38.331 --> 00:38:43.856]  If you catch an axe murderer or a killer or somebody who thinks a killer, you can't compel them to incriminate themselves.
[00:38:44.677 --> 00:38:46.119]  That's what the Fifth Amendment says.
[00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:51.124]  But now it's spread out to, now we want to take your blood.
[00:38:52.745 --> 00:38:54.267]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:38:54.287 --> 00:38:58.091]  You can say, well, this causes thousands of deaths a year, tens of thousands, we've got to do it.
[00:38:58.951 --> 00:39:00.151]  It's a major problem.
[00:39:00.192 --> 00:39:03.853]  But then you get into the feds have said it's in Patriot Act II.
[00:39:03.873 --> 00:39:07.914]  They want a national DNA database for anybody arrested, even for traffic citations.
[00:39:07.934 --> 00:39:12.716]  They're already taking thumbprints now, even when you're just given a ticket in many states and many cities.
[00:39:13.577 --> 00:39:16.518]  And, I mean, I see this going and turning into a database.
[00:39:16.558 --> 00:39:17.238]  What do you say to that?
[00:39:18.698 --> 00:39:22.520]  That begins correct, because we're not taking blood on everybody that we stop.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.181]  We're just taking blood on those that are arrested for DUI.
[00:39:26.078 --> 00:39:41.301]  And in Utah we have what's called an implied consent law, which basically says that anybody that's operating a vehicle in the state of Utah has given their consent to take anything as long as they're arrested for DUI.
[00:39:41.361 --> 00:39:48.023]  Yeah, you're saying it's a privilege to drive, and so now that you're on the Kings Highway that we can do this to you.
[00:39:48.877 --> 00:39:53.561]  Well, the aspect here is that they need to be arrested for a DUI prior.
[00:39:53.601 --> 00:40:03.669]  We can't just stop somebody and have a fishing expedition where we're just... Ah, the Supreme Court said two Mondays ago that you can randomly set up checkpoints randomly with drug dogs.
[00:40:06.252 --> 00:40:12.016]  As far as I know, I haven't read that Supreme Court hearing, so I can't really...
[00:40:13.317 --> 00:40:15.639]  Well, there's ten other rulings saying you can't.
[00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:16.820]  So that's another question.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.941]  How do you guys handle that?
[00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:22.666]  Because these are case by case, and then most of the rulings say you can't do that, but the new ruling says you can.
[00:40:22.906 --> 00:40:24.267]  How do the state police decide?
[00:40:26.169 --> 00:40:32.095]  Here in Utah, we have policy and procedures in place where if we're going to set up a roadblock, we have to go through all the...
[00:40:34.436 --> 00:40:44.898]  I asked him during the break, officer, about Arizona and Nevada.
[00:40:45.258 --> 00:40:50.939]  Now, again, I have the news articles where they take the blood and do a swab test there on the spot.
[00:40:50.979 --> 00:40:51.979]  You said you weren't aware of that.
[00:40:52.679 --> 00:41:01.521]  Yeah, I know that Arizona's been doing a blood draw program like we're implementing here, but I was not aware of a program where they're just taking blood on the side of the road.
[00:41:02.538 --> 00:41:04.240]  I wasn't aware of a program like that.
[00:41:05.362 --> 00:41:07.785]  And that's not what we're going to be doing here in Utah.
[00:41:09.437 --> 00:41:11.057]  Well, let me bring something else up to you.
[00:41:11.537 --> 00:41:12.998]  Okay, I don't think you're bad.
[00:41:13.518 --> 00:41:22.040]  Okay, but I'm sure you heard about the Houston Crime Lab where they headlined, the police chief admitted, thousands were framed.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.620]  I mean, no one who went through it was found not guilty.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.501]  It was just basically they just certified everybody as guilty.
[00:41:27.801 --> 00:41:35.523]  I'm sure you heard about the Houston Crime Lab, but also the Dallas Crime Lab where they'd throw the bag of chalk in the back of the car and then it would be certified as cocaine.
[00:41:35.543 --> 00:41:36.143]  Did you hear about that?
[00:41:37.012 --> 00:41:37.812]  I didn't hear about that.
[00:41:37.832 --> 00:41:42.735]  Did you hear about the FBI crime lab back in 97, where the head of it, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, went public?
[00:41:42.775 --> 00:41:47.737]  I've interviewed him and said that they're basically industrialized frame-ups.
[00:41:47.757 --> 00:41:48.378]  Did you hear about that?
[00:41:49.138 --> 00:41:50.139]  I didn't hear about that one either.
[00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:55.681]  They had a CNN special about a month ago about all these systems.
[00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:58.183]  I'm sure you know that prints can be faked, too.
[00:41:58.763 --> 00:42:01.864]  With these digital prints that are being taken, it's quite easy to fake prints.
[00:42:01.884 --> 00:42:02.485]  Were you aware of that?
[00:42:03.165 --> 00:42:04.186]  I'm not aware of that either.
[00:42:04.506 --> 00:42:04.746]  Really?
[00:42:05.382 --> 00:42:05.622]  No.
[00:42:05.822 --> 00:42:07.784]  Well, I mean, that's the problem with all of this.
[00:42:08.264 --> 00:42:19.611]  Well, I bet you know that, I mean, just from when they test a lot of pregnant women's blood to see if they're on drugs, that in some of these tests, upwards of 30% of the time, say for a cocaine test, they get false positives?
[00:42:21.092 --> 00:42:24.734]  Yeah, those are probably, I don't know what kind of tests they're using on those.
[00:42:25.375 --> 00:42:33.480]  We'll be sending ours to the state toxicology lab where they have the gas chromatograph testing facility, and that's how they'll be tested there.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.582]  But you don't know the numbers of failure on those?
[00:42:38.602 --> 00:42:42.824]  That's something that would have to be discussed to the lab.
[00:42:43.204 --> 00:42:44.624]  I'm not aware of any of those.
[00:42:44.745 --> 00:42:45.905]  How do people challenge?
[00:42:45.925 --> 00:42:48.406]  Do you ever have folks challenge the toxicology results?
[00:42:48.986 --> 00:42:49.647]  Oh, yeah, all the time.
[00:42:50.107 --> 00:42:51.988]  Especially with breath alcohol, yes.
[00:42:53.788 --> 00:42:55.449]  Well, what do their lawyers recommend?
[00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:59.291]  That they run out as soon as they're out of jail and get their blood taken by a separate lab?
[00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:01.252]  The lawyers haven't...
[00:43:02.325 --> 00:43:10.289]  I don't know what the lawyers are telling their clients to do as far as that, but we do give them the opportunity that if they wish to get another test, they're more than welcome to.
[00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:14.211]  How does that hold up in court, these drug tests?
[00:43:14.231 --> 00:43:15.872]  I mean, I'm sure you go to court a lot.
[00:43:16.112 --> 00:43:21.195]  What's the ballpark conviction rate?
[00:43:21.295 --> 00:43:22.996]  I'm not exactly sure on the conviction rate.
[00:43:23.056 --> 00:43:25.537]  Are you just talking blood alcohol or are you talking breath alcohol?
[00:43:25.557 --> 00:43:25.917]  Drugs.
[00:43:26.317 --> 00:43:27.178]  Yeah, illegal drugs.
[00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:32.803]  Legal drugs, they're fairly well convicted in Utah.
[00:43:32.823 --> 00:43:34.504]  I don't know the percentage, but it's fairly high.
[00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:38.785]  What do you do, let's say, if you find codeine, or do you test for prescription drugs?
[00:43:39.965 --> 00:43:45.406]  The lab does have a list of prescription drugs they do test for, just depending on which drug it is.
[00:43:45.426 --> 00:43:49.847]  There are a lot of drugs that they can't detect, but there are quite a few that they can.
[00:43:49.887 --> 00:43:51.848]  What do you do if they prove that they had a prescription?
[00:43:52.717 --> 00:44:04.504]  Well, what we'd have to do on that is the person would have to get their physician to come in and make sure that the amounts that they're taking are within their therapeutic dosage that they should be taking.
[00:44:04.544 --> 00:44:06.846]  And the insert says don't operate machinery, yeah.
[00:44:07.146 --> 00:44:15.471]  Yeah, and stuff like that, where they've been advised don't be mixing alcohol and these types of drugs or don't be mixing these two different types of drugs.
[00:44:16.283 --> 00:44:17.844]  That sometimes is what the problem is.
[00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:22.608]  They're either taking too much of a certain dose or they're mixing doses that they shouldn't be mixing.
[00:44:22.668 --> 00:44:24.129]  What is this federal program?
[00:44:24.189 --> 00:44:25.851]  I mean, it says this is federally paid for.
[00:44:25.871 --> 00:44:27.852]  What's the federal program?
[00:44:28.313 --> 00:44:35.458]  It's actually our Utah Highway Safety Department that's actually giving us the money to do the training.
[00:44:36.419 --> 00:44:39.301]  And they get their money from the federal government.
[00:44:39.461 --> 00:44:43.725]  Yeah, that's the 1998 National Seatbelt and Safety Initiative.
[00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:49.153]  Yeah, and then they also have some money as far as DUI and alcohol enforcement.
[00:44:49.513 --> 00:44:52.616]  I believe it's called the 410 money as well.
[00:44:53.536 --> 00:44:56.659]  I don't know exactly which grant this is coming from.
[00:44:56.699 --> 00:45:00.982]  Well, I know the big one, the 2.4 bill a year is the Bill Clinton funded.
[00:45:01.062 --> 00:45:03.264]  It says Seat Belt Safety Initiative.
[00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:05.045]  It doesn't have much to do with seat belts.
[00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:09.912]  What are you planning to do with the thumb scanners in the car?
[00:45:09.932 --> 00:45:12.695]  I know a lot of state police are putting those in their federal grants.
[00:45:12.715 --> 00:45:14.276]  Have you heard anything about that, Sergeant?
[00:45:14.697 --> 00:45:16.859]  Yeah, we don't have thumb scanners in our cars.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.480]  Are you getting those?
[00:45:18.941 --> 00:45:23.125]  No, I don't know of any program where we're going to be having those in our car anytime soon.
[00:45:23.225 --> 00:45:24.426]  What do you think of that program?
[00:45:25.607 --> 00:45:28.890]  I really can't comment on it since I really don't know anything about it.
[00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:33.601]  Well, Mike, if you need to get that radio, you can, of course.
[00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:36.702]  But, Sergeant, I mean, think about America.
[00:45:36.762 --> 00:45:37.982]  I mean, picture America.
[00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:43.223]  What America's always supposed to be and what America's been.
[00:45:43.263 --> 00:45:48.884]  I mean, the image of police and now taking you to jail and needles and then thumb scanners.
[00:45:48.964 --> 00:45:50.845]  And I read these articles about old ladies.
[00:45:50.885 --> 00:45:53.025]  I mean, I remember watching my grandmother who's passed now.
[00:45:53.565 --> 00:45:56.366]  You know, when she'd get ready to go on a trip, she'd get all her pills out.
[00:45:57.186 --> 00:45:58.767]  She probably took 10 different medications.
[00:45:58.807 --> 00:46:04.031]  You know, they sell them at the grocery store in a little box with Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:46:04.692 --> 00:46:06.073]  And, you know, she put all her pills in there.
[00:46:06.093 --> 00:46:11.977]  And I have articles today of people being arrested for having their prescription pills out of the box.
[00:46:12.037 --> 00:46:13.378]  Do you guys arrest folks for that?
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:25.207]  If they're starting to mix that, they do have some codes in our code book that they're not supposed to take medication, that they're supposed to have their prescription available so they know at least what they're getting prescribed.
[00:46:26.696 --> 00:46:32.261]  So, I mean, you guys, if you pull over somebody and they got their prescriptions, but they're not in the bottle, they go to jail?
[00:46:33.142 --> 00:46:34.283]  No, not necessarily.
[00:46:34.323 --> 00:46:39.388]  It just depends on, you know, we usually search for impairment first.
[00:46:39.428 --> 00:46:40.869]  Officer discretion?
[00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:47.556]  Yeah, the officer is going to decide if a person's impaired prior to them arresting, just because, you know, there may be a...
[00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:51.273]  No, you don't know what... But I don't mean just impaired.
[00:46:51.313 --> 00:46:56.177]  I mean, I've got articles literally every week where people get arrested just for not having their pills in their bottle.
[00:46:57.638 --> 00:46:58.579]  In the prescription bottle.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.540]  And that may happen.
[00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:05.684]  But like I said, here in Utah, I don't know of many cases like that happening.
[00:47:07.545 --> 00:47:08.726]  I can't speak for other states.
[00:47:08.786 --> 00:47:09.547]  Well, I understand.
[00:47:09.587 --> 00:47:14.771]  It's just, I mean, you know, the state police are pretty similar across the country, go off some of the same guidelines, so...
[00:47:15.818 --> 00:47:18.700]  I'm just, it seems like everything's being criminalized.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.061]  Do you know how much our prison population's expanded, officer?
[00:47:23.482 --> 00:47:24.983]  I'm sure there's quite a few in there.
[00:47:25.924 --> 00:47:29.585]  Well, it's gone from 1.3 million to 7 million in the system in 10 years.
[00:47:32.707 --> 00:47:36.409]  And the bigger the police state gets, you know there's more drugs now than there were 10 years ago.
[00:47:37.049 --> 00:47:37.710]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:41.612]  So how is it we have more people in prison, more enforcement, but more drugs?
[00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.511]  I don't know how to answer that one.
[00:47:46.291 --> 00:47:57.516]  So, I read a Wall Street Journal article out of Arizona where somebody refused to let him take blood, and he resisted, and then he died in the struggle.
[00:47:57.536 --> 00:47:58.576]  Were you aware of those cases?
[00:47:59.317 --> 00:47:59.977]  No, I was not.
[00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:04.919]  What do you guys do if somebody refuses to give blood at the police station or at the jail?
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.362]  Right now, if they refuse, we'll ask them to submit.
[00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:13.422]  Right now we're getting policy.
[00:48:13.442 --> 00:48:18.224]  We have a policy in place as far as refusal goes that we can get a telephonic search warrant to take the blood.
[00:48:19.064 --> 00:48:29.168]  But if they're being resistant and fighting, chances are we're not going to take the blood if it jeopardizes the safety of our officers or the safety of the person that we're taking the blood from.
[00:48:29.188 --> 00:48:41.013]  And depending on the crime, I mean, if there's a person that was involved in an accident where, you know, killed somebody, the chances of us getting blood out of them is going to be... We're going to try to get more, you know...
[00:48:42.048 --> 00:48:47.832]  The evidence out of them, more than we, you know, if we just stop someone for DUI and they're fighting, you know, we'll probably just leave that one alone.
[00:48:48.032 --> 00:48:48.433]  We'll see.
[00:48:48.473 --> 00:48:53.236]  If it was kind of fighting long, where if it was a serious injury or fatality they took blood, I wouldn't have a problem with it.
[00:48:53.256 --> 00:48:56.959]  But we're talking about, it says $50 per blood extraction, upwards of $25,000 a year.
[00:48:56.979 --> 00:48:57.719]  I mean, 50 into 25,000.
[00:48:57.919 --> 00:48:58.920]  How many blood tests is that?
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.501]  That's about 500.
[00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:00.541]  Here in Utah.
[00:49:11.607 --> 00:49:12.508]  That's just for drugs.
[00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:15.230]  We also have alcohol testing.
[00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:20.194]  Like I said before, if we do a test, it's usually an alcohol test.
[00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:25.758]  And if the alcohol impairment is what we're looking for, then that's all we do.
[00:49:25.778 --> 00:49:26.659]  We don't need to take blood.
[00:49:26.679 --> 00:49:32.084]  Well, I would imagine that you guys will be taking more blood now once you get 60 officers.
[00:49:32.464 --> 00:49:35.046]  Then I guess they'll be authorized to train others.
[00:49:35.066 --> 00:49:36.367]  60 officers trained on top of it.
[00:49:36.387 --> 00:49:37.568]  I bet you guys are going to boost it.
[00:49:38.516 --> 00:49:40.818]  Well, it just depends on the situation.
[00:49:40.858 --> 00:49:49.384]  We're still going to stick with our protocol that if the impairment doesn't match the alcohol results, then we'll take the blood if they're impaired on drugs.
[00:49:51.405 --> 00:49:53.767]  I don't see that number growing astronomically.
[00:49:54.287 --> 00:50:01.832]  It may increase a little bit, but because there are some areas where we don't have the ability, we don't have technicians in place to take the blood.
[00:50:02.153 --> 00:50:06.996]  Utah does have some rural areas where it's kind of hard to get someone to draw blood out there.
[00:50:08.024 --> 00:50:17.486]  So it's going to be kind of convenient for some of the officers to get trained in those areas and not have someone that's available to control the blood.
[00:50:17.646 --> 00:50:18.967]  Well, Officer, I'll just say this.
[00:50:18.987 --> 00:50:30.529]  I know you've got a tough job, and I'm glad it's not my job, but I really think you need to do some research and just look at how the more we do this, actually the less safe things get, the more people in prison, the more drugs.
[00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:37.511]  The drug war is a complete and total failure, and I think the answer is just
[00:50:39.552 --> 00:50:42.373]  Is simply education on these subjects.
[00:50:42.553 --> 00:50:48.774]  But I do appreciate you coming on the broadcast, and I hope nobody ever tries to take my blood, and I appreciate you coming on, Sergeant.
[00:50:49.254 --> 00:50:49.754]  Okay, thank you.
[00:50:50.094 --> 00:50:50.514]  Take care.
[00:50:50.574 --> 00:50:51.494]  Have a great week.
[00:50:52.254 --> 00:50:54.855]  We'll come back, cover more news, take your calls.
[00:50:56.395 --> 00:50:59.336]  Just hope you don't go to Arizona where they suck your blood on the street corner.
[00:51:03.116 --> 00:51:05.957]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.707 --> 00:51:08.009]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:08.209 --> 00:51:13.957]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:19.504]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.784 --> 00:51:23.910]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:39.129]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:39.169 --> 00:51:41.012]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:41.172 --> 00:51:41.392]  That's 1-888-2533-139.

[00:51:47.274 --> 00:51:49.414]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:02.862 --> 00:52:05.865]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:15.034]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:15.374 --> 00:52:20.039]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:20.499 --> 00:52:27.221]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:39.385]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:39.885 --> 00:52:44.348]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:52:51.594 --> 00:52:52.654]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:53:41.141 --> 00:53:41.962]  We're good to go.
[00:54:19.253 --> 00:54:21.074]  Let me tell you how this scam works.
[00:54:23.336 --> 00:54:26.358]  The state police, the local cops, they can all be good guys.
[00:54:26.858 --> 00:54:27.319]  Good women.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.600]  Good men and women.
[00:54:30.401 --> 00:54:31.822]  But it's these crime labs.
[00:54:32.782 --> 00:54:34.383]  Just type in your state's name.
[00:54:34.423 --> 00:54:38.586]  Say, Texas Crime Lab Fraud.
[00:54:39.127 --> 00:54:40.407]  Or Crime Lab in Trouble.
[00:54:40.507 --> 00:54:45.651]  Or type in Florida or New York or Massachusetts or California.
[00:54:46.969 --> 00:54:53.592]  Just type it in and prepare yourselves for all these mainstream news articles that never made the national news.
[00:54:56.033 --> 00:54:59.454]  And all you've got to have is crooks in control of the crime labs and it's all over.
[00:55:01.355 --> 00:55:04.456]  And it is widespread fraud.
[00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:07.758]  And in a lot of cases it's just laziness.
[00:55:07.778 --> 00:55:10.199]  They just certify, oh yeah, he had it in his blood.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.981]  It's just flat laziness in some cases like the Houston crime lab.
[00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.773]  I mean, thousands of innocent people given positives.
[00:55:20.373 --> 00:55:23.877]  And we're talking about not just drunk driving or driving under the influence of drugs.
[00:55:23.897 --> 00:55:26.279]  We're talking about murder cases, stuff like that.
[00:55:28.841 --> 00:55:36.368]  And that's because private industry now basically is taking control of law enforcement, is taking control of the prisons, and it's a money-making operation.
[00:55:36.388 --> 00:55:42.013]  The biggest industry in America isn't microchips, isn't semiconductors, it isn't...
[00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:44.700]  Energy.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.321]  It isn't manufacturing.
[00:55:46.442 --> 00:55:48.884]  It's prisons and security and law enforcement.
[00:55:49.385 --> 00:55:50.606]  Biggest industry in America.
[00:55:50.686 --> 00:55:53.489]  And the pendulum's even going more in that direction.
[00:55:53.529 --> 00:55:54.530]  It's even getting worse.
[00:55:56.232 --> 00:55:57.673]  Then I have articles like this one.
[00:55:57.853 --> 00:56:01.117]  I've got one where an elderly lady was pulled over, taken to jail.
[00:56:01.497 --> 00:56:02.238]  But here's another one.
[00:56:02.298 --> 00:56:07.163]  Arizona sheriff orders fingerprinting when traffic citations issued.
[00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:26.090]  Mentioned that earlier, and then I have another report here about a child ordered to go on Ritalin, took his Ritalin to school, had it in the old pill bottle that had been a few days expired, and so they went ahead and arrested him and charged him with a bunch of stuff.
[00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.912]  What was the school that ordered him on the drugs to begin with?
[00:56:28.932 --> 00:56:30.332]  They go, well, zero tolerance.
[00:56:30.913 --> 00:56:35.975]  And I have another article here, a 73-year-old woman put in jail for feeding pigeons in her backyard.
[00:56:36.256 --> 00:56:37.016]  It's all about...
[00:56:37.697 --> 00:56:41.039]  Arresting the citizenry for the most petty of reasons.
[00:56:42.861 --> 00:56:46.663]  Now, coming up, we're going to talk about the war with Iran and Syria.
[00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:48.245]  It's already going on.
[00:56:50.606 --> 00:56:53.348]  They've already got forces inside the country trying to destabilize them.
[00:56:53.368 --> 00:56:58.532]  There's already military sorties into Syria.
[00:56:58.712 --> 00:56:59.993]  Going on for the last year and a half.
[00:57:00.933 --> 00:57:01.794]  Or a little over a year.
[00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:04.176]  And we're going to talk about...
[00:57:05.345 --> 00:57:06.765]  Which Rumsfeld do we believe?
[00:57:06.805 --> 00:57:07.746]  Which Bush do we believe?
[00:57:07.766 --> 00:57:08.846]  The one that says we're going to invade?
[00:57:08.866 --> 00:57:09.646]  The one that says we're not?
[00:57:11.487 --> 00:57:17.188]  So we'll be talking to a guest who's an expert on this coming up in the next hour, and we'll open the phones up for you to call in.
[00:57:18.008 --> 00:57:24.810]  Before I end this hour, I just briefly want to encourage all of you to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:26.773 --> 00:57:43.318]  And to order some of the videos or books or other films and materials I carry, the films I've made, the other videos and books I carry, you can go to the secure, safe shopping cart, read about all the titles, watch free clips of the films, or read free copies of certain chapters of the books.

[00:57:54.266 --> 00:57:55.407]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[00:57:55.447 --> 00:57:56.067]  It's so easy.
[00:57:56.427 --> 00:58:01.231]  Or as I said, go to infowars.com and order a hard copy via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:58:02.125 --> 00:58:04.227]  My 9-11 films, they're excellent.
[00:58:04.767 --> 00:58:06.428]  My Police State videos are excellent.
[00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:09.251]  My Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove is a must-see.
[00:58:09.811 --> 00:58:11.853]  Toll-free number to order the films.
[00:58:11.893 --> 00:58:13.714]  They can answer your questions when you call.

[00:58:18.598 --> 00:58:19.278]  1-888-253-3139 to call and order.
[00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:30.987]  Big Brother.
[00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:31.268]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.933 --> 00:59:00.974]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.714 --> 00:59:02.815]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.455 --> 00:59:04.276]  You want answers?
[00:59:05.036 --> 00:59:05.957]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.597 --> 00:59:10.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.215 --> 00:59:29.880]  Alright, my friends, we're now 30 seconds into the second hour on this seventh day of February 2005.
[00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:33.102]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:33.142 --> 00:59:34.023]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:34.063 --> 00:59:37.866]  Coming up in the next segment, physicist James Prather.
[00:59:38.366 --> 00:59:51.491]  ...has served as a policy implementing official for the National Security Related Medical Matters in the Federal Energy Agency, the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Department of Energy, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the Department of the Army.
[00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:56.492]  Dr. Prather also served as legislative assistant for National Security Affairs to U.S.
[00:59:56.532 --> 01:00:05.675]  Senator Henry Bellman, Republican, Oklahoma, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and member of the Senate Energy Committee and Appropriations Committee.
[01:00:05.955 --> 01:00:07.536]  He's coming on to talk about, well,
[01:00:08.248 --> 01:00:12.350]  The neocons, and are we going to be invading Iran or Syria, or aren't we?
[01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.431]  Which Rumsfeld statement are we supposed to believe?
[01:00:15.831 --> 01:00:18.412]  Which Rice statement are we supposed to believe?
[01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:21.113]  That is all coming up.
[01:00:21.613 --> 01:00:24.514]  And, of course, your phone calls, for those of you that are patiently holding.
[01:00:25.314 --> 01:00:27.655]  We will take your calls in this hour.
[01:00:29.336 --> 01:00:33.898]  Also coming up, I've got just a plethora of articles like this one.
[01:00:34.018 --> 01:00:37.499]  Bulletproof cameras ready to patrol New Orleans.
[01:00:38.214 --> 01:00:39.835]  Put in by Homeland Security.
[01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:48.237]  And it dovetails with funds by Homeland Security to hire and train police to take your blood and, quote, catch you on drugs.
[01:00:48.638 --> 01:00:50.278]  But you can't trust their crime labs.
[01:00:50.998 --> 01:00:52.899]  Not to mention the fact it violates the Fifth Amendment.
[01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:57.541]  And then out of the Bennington Banner newspaper, Drug Sniffing Dog makes a score.
[01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:07.584]  During a routine drug check at Washington County Drug Sniffing Dog, local police found three tablets of the controlled substance
[01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:15.036]  Consecrita, a chemical treatment for attention deficit disorder, especially methamphetamines.
[01:01:15.056 --> 01:01:15.796]  The dog smelled it.
[01:01:17.077 --> 01:01:22.900]  In an expired prescription bottle in the locker of a 15-year-old student in Cangebridge Central School on Wednesday.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:29.783]  Turns out the student did have a current prescription for it, but had it in the wrong bottle, so he's being charged and going on probation.
[01:01:30.283 --> 01:01:33.024]  And it's the school that pushed to have the child put on it to begin with.
[01:01:33.044 --> 01:01:36.866]  And I just wanted to go over this because it shows how sick the system is.
[01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.387]  There's nothing reasonable about it.
[01:01:39.753 --> 01:01:41.714]  When they find out you're innocent, it doesn't matter.
[01:01:41.734 --> 01:01:43.735]  It doesn't matter if they put you on the drugs to begin with.
[01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.295]  It's about getting you into the system.
[01:01:46.395 --> 01:01:54.918]  The teenager whose name will not be released because he is juvenile was asked to open up his locker after the dog gave an alert for the presence of drugs at the boy's locker.
[01:01:56.719 --> 01:02:02.781]  And it says the prescription, which contains the same active ingredient as methamphetamine, as Ritalin, had expired.
[01:02:03.581 --> 01:02:07.723]  According to public health law, prescriptions may not be kept in a non-approval bottle.
[01:02:08.123 --> 01:02:17.067]  Village Police Chief George Bell said he believed the tablets were not expired themselves, but only being kept in the old bottle.
[01:02:17.888 --> 01:02:26.572]  So, now we have the police chief saying he didn't do anything, but continuing to say it is our belief that he had a current prescription.
[01:02:27.532 --> 01:02:28.312]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:02:28.432 --> 01:02:34.315]  The student will still be issued a citation and go to juvenile probation court.
[01:02:34.555 --> 01:02:38.637]  So he's completely innocent, and we ordered him to go on the methamphetamine.
[01:02:39.317 --> 01:02:46.660]  They'll SWAT team your house looking for that stuff, but they'll put six million children at one time.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:47.600]  That was old numbers.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:47.960]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.261]  Nine million children at any one time on this.
[01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:56.304]  Fifteen percent of our children on Ritalin, the methamphetamine-type class of drugs.
[01:02:57.082 --> 01:03:01.425]  There's a whole class of them, which literally is methamphetamine, as it just said in the newspaper.
[01:03:01.465 --> 01:03:02.325]  The police chief admits it.
[01:03:03.306 --> 01:03:17.275]  And millions of others on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are the equivalent of LSD, affect the same area of the brain, and are psychotropic for a subclass of hallucinogens, or hallucinogenic compounds.
[01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:20.457]  So, isn't that just special?
[01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:23.839]  And under the New Freedom Initiative, the government says that they're going to put...
[01:03:24.716 --> 01:03:28.359]  Half the children in America up from 15% on these drugs.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.982]  And don't let your child get caught with it in the wrong bottle, though.
[01:03:32.822 --> 01:03:37.306]  Or the drug dealers that are pushing these drugs will put them in their little slave plantation to build widgets for them.
[01:03:38.007 --> 01:03:38.847]  It's a great system.
[01:03:39.408 --> 01:03:41.870]  They push legal drugs and illegal drugs on your kids.
[01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:47.054]  When they use them, they put them in a private prison, working for 20 cents an hour, competing against our jobs.
[01:03:48.315 --> 01:03:49.275]  But, eh, so what?
[01:03:49.295 --> 01:03:50.536]  I guess it's part of the New World Order.
[01:03:50.556 --> 01:03:51.137]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:58.387]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:03.011]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:07.535]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.575 --> 01:04:08.937]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:14.921]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.982 --> 01:04:21.927]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:22.047 --> 01:04:24.129]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:34.877]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:35.058 --> 01:04:39.241]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State,
[01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:41.684]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:56.702]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:04:57.062 --> 01:04:59.944]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:05:00.164 --> 01:05:06.388]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:05:06.748 --> 01:05:14.053]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:05:14.233 --> 01:05:18.256]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:05:18.596 --> 01:05:24.138]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:37.463]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:00.165]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pep back in your step.
[01:06:00.365 --> 01:06:05.349]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:18.840]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.323]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:24.944]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[01:06:25.124 --> 01:06:28.967]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:32.228]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[01:06:32.469 --> 01:06:35.971]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:40.333]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition or just trying to beat the clock?
[01:06:40.633 --> 01:06:42.854]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[01:06:43.055 --> 01:06:46.376]  Go to www.LifeWavePromotions.com.
[01:06:46.657 --> 01:06:50.139]  Again, that's www.LifeWavePromotions.com.
[01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:56.991]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.571 --> 01:07:00.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:18.537]  Right before 9-11, New Hampshire had lined up almost all of its cities and counties and selectmen, as they're called in that state, to pull out of the union, quote, because of...
[01:07:19.597 --> 01:07:22.518]  Corruption in the federal government and quote the New World Order.
[01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:26.760]  And I had mayors and county commissioners on, select men covering it.
[01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:29.522]  And the 9-11 came and that never happened.
[01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:30.942]  They were about a week away from voting.
[01:07:32.063 --> 01:07:34.904]  I had assemblymen on as well from their statehouse.
[01:07:35.725 --> 01:07:37.646]  Now I have the report here.
[01:07:38.786 --> 01:07:41.367]  New Hampshire introduces resolution to get U.S.
[01:07:41.528 --> 01:07:41.788]  out of U.N.
[01:07:43.906 --> 01:07:47.628]  This has been introduced in the House Concurrent Resolution 1.
[01:07:48.548 --> 01:07:50.489]  We'll be talking about that later.
[01:07:51.849 --> 01:07:58.252]  Also, I want to get into this new IBM Super Chip that's coming out.
[01:07:58.412 --> 01:08:01.133]  IBM Sony Toshiba to Reveal Super Brain Chip.
[01:08:01.473 --> 01:08:05.175]  That's the headline from the Financial Times of London.
[01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:07.616]  And much, much more.
[01:08:08.928 --> 01:08:09.873]  And of course, your calls.
[01:08:09.993 --> 01:08:13.931]  Right now, though, I'm honored to be joined by physicist James Prather.
[01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:30.794]  And his bio is lengthy, so I won't read all of it, but he served as a policy implementing official for national security-related technical matters in the Federal Energy Agency, the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Department of Energy, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the Department of the Army.
[01:08:30.834 --> 01:08:34.455]  Dr. Prather also served as legislative assistant for national security affairs.
[01:08:34.555 --> 01:08:34.715]  U.S.
[01:08:34.735 --> 01:08:40.496]  Senator Henry Bellman, Republican, Oklahoma, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and member of the...
[01:08:41.156 --> 01:08:42.516]  Well, thank you very much, sir.
[01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:43.297]  Pleasure to be here.
[01:08:43.317 --> 01:08:43.517]  You bet.
[01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:45.857]  Headline today, Rumsfeld, Iran years away from nuclear weapon.
[01:09:10.792 --> 01:09:13.274]  But I typed it into Google last night.
[01:09:14.115 --> 01:09:20.100]  Rumsfeld says Iran already has nukes, and here articles popped up.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.381]  So which Rumsfeld should I believe?
[01:09:23.763 --> 01:09:29.767]  Well, I don't know that you need to believe either one of them.
[01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:35.032]  The people that you ought to pay some attention to, I think, are the...
[01:09:36.928 --> 01:09:51.051]  The International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors that have been searching that country from stem to stern for almost two years, more than a year and a half.
[01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:55.372]  There is an article, if you haven't seen it, let me call your attention to it.
[01:09:55.453 --> 01:10:02.474]  It's actually an op-ed piece that appears today in the Washington Post.
[01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:04.135]  It's by David Kaye.
[01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:05.815]  David Kaye
[01:10:06.664 --> 01:10:10.925]  was an employee.
[01:10:11.185 --> 01:10:34.030]  That is, he was not assigned there by us, but he was an employee of the International Atomic Energy Agency for most of the 80s and was in Iraq for five or six months in 1991 as the International Atomic Energy Agency went in to see what they could find in Iraq after the Gulf War.
[01:10:36.658 --> 01:10:42.222]  He left the IAEA, sort of, I don't know whether he was fired or not.
[01:10:42.262 --> 01:10:50.168]  He says he wasn't, and Hans Blix, who was the Director General of the IAEA at the time, says that he wasn't.
[01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:54.211]  Sorry, the phone's ringing here.
[01:10:54.232 --> 01:10:55.653]  I've got to stop it somehow or another.
[01:10:55.733 --> 01:10:56.253]  I understand.
[01:10:56.293 --> 01:10:57.074]  That happens a lot.
[01:10:57.334 --> 01:11:02.918]  But at any rate, let me just again set the stage for this piece that...
[01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:06.858]  It's just a remarkable thing.
[01:11:08.198 --> 01:11:09.259]  I urge everybody to read it.
[01:11:09.339 --> 01:11:14.041]  I'd almost like to read the whole thing to you, but let me just tell you who David Kaye was.
[01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:22.724]  He left the IAEA in January of 1992 and spent a year in London.
[01:11:22.744 --> 01:11:31.488]  Then he eventually got hired by a company that was being paid by the CIA.
[01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:33.909]  For six or eight years he worked for them.
[01:11:35.214 --> 01:11:57.021]  Then, just before the Gulf War, he started appearing before Congress and issuing press releases and things like that, and he, according to people like Scott Ritter, I think you know who Scott Ritter is, I won't bother going into that, blamed him, and I, in some of my columns, I've essentially blamed him for
[01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:06.568]  For those that don't know who he is, he's the guy with the mustache, the bulldog, saying they've got weapons, they're going to kill us any minute.
[01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:07.149]  That's right.
[01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:07.869]  That's the guy.
[01:12:08.089 --> 01:12:08.450]  Okay.
[01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:16.716]  And then after the troops go in, almost two years ago, then a year ago he starts saying, no, it's not true, no, they don't have it.
[01:12:16.857 --> 01:12:22.081]  But he had no position at all except being paid by the CIA up until the Gulf War.
[01:12:22.825 --> 01:12:27.793]  Then about six months after Operation Iraqi Freedom, as you said, he was
[01:12:33.644 --> 01:12:38.547]  Pointed the head of the Iraq Survey Group, I think was what it was called.
[01:12:38.907 --> 01:12:56.657]  Anyway, this was the CIA-backed thing that went in and spent, oh, I don't know, something close to a billion dollars, a billion thousand, and looked, you know, for all kinds of things, weapons of mass destruction and missiles and things like that, not just nuclear weapons.
[01:12:57.427 --> 01:13:00.653]  And he got so discouraged that he quit about a year ago.
[01:13:03.177 --> 01:13:04.740]  Well, here's my question to you, sir.
[01:13:05.962 --> 01:13:08.125]  Our listeners, I mean, everybody knows the basic story.
[01:13:08.706 --> 01:13:11.030]  Why now do we see this guy and others...
[01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:15.569]  Flip-flopping and saying it was all basically a fraud.
[01:13:16.009 --> 01:13:19.991]  Well, the piece today is even worse.
[01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:29.314]  The title of it, this is now David Kaye, so the title of this op-ed piece is Let's Not Make the Same Mistakes in Iran.
[01:13:29.855 --> 01:13:40.039]  And so he goes through there and he says, he rehashes, as you just did, what we did, and a lot of it was just him, of course,
[01:13:41.254 --> 01:13:44.197]  Before we went into Iraq this last time.
[01:13:44.217 --> 01:13:52.944]  And now he says that they're doing the same damn thing again now, except that it's for Iran.
[01:13:54.786 --> 01:14:09.058]  And he suggests five things that we ought to do or ought not to do to avoid making the same mistake of going into a country that says it doesn't have nuclear weapons
[01:14:09.765 --> 01:14:16.788]  And the International Atomic Energy Agency is on the ground going everywhere that it wants to go.
[01:14:16.808 --> 01:14:21.210]  They've not been denied access to any place in Iran that they wanted to go.
[01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:29.534]  And just like was the case in Iraq, the CIA tells them sometimes, well, we think there's something weird going on at such and such a place.
[01:14:29.774 --> 01:14:30.815]  You ought to go see that.
[01:14:31.355 --> 01:14:33.756]  So they do, and they don't find anything.
[01:14:34.463 --> 01:14:56.032]  At any rate, but then you have the President and Rumsfeld and Condi Rice and all these other people who get up there and make these statements that we have no doubt, the United States has no doubt that they've got nuclear weapons, some programs ongoing, and that they actually have nuclear weapons.
[01:14:56.092 --> 01:14:59.614]  Well, I want to go over this, though, but I want to get to a central point in this.
[01:14:59.654 --> 01:14:59.874]  Yeah.
[01:15:00.925 --> 01:15:10.013]  You know, we've got people like Jude Winanski, who we had on last week, member of the CFR, insider, Karl Rove calls him up for advice.
[01:15:10.853 --> 01:15:15.017]  He's now coming out against him and calling it a global empire and calling it a conspiracy.
[01:15:15.977 --> 01:15:19.060]  You're on the broadcast talking about this.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:25.185]  Well, why is David Kaye, who's been paid by these people, done all this, suddenly flip-flopping?
[01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:27.467]  I mean, has he told us why he's doing this?
[01:15:27.747 --> 01:15:28.548]  I think it's guilt.
[01:15:29.408 --> 01:15:32.451]  I have no idea who's paying him now, if anyone is.
[01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:36.434]  He resigned a year ago as head of this CIA organization.
[01:15:36.894 --> 01:15:37.675]  I forget how many.
[01:15:38.216 --> 01:15:45.401]  There were several thousand of them, I think, people involved in that search in Iraq, and they didn't find a dang thing.
[01:15:45.461 --> 01:15:47.163]  And I guess he's feeling a little guilty.
[01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:50.585]  And for those who don't know, I mean, you help work on nuclear weapons.
[01:15:50.826 --> 01:15:54.128]  You don't just make an atom bomb or a hydrogen bomb in your basement.
[01:15:54.609 --> 01:15:55.830]  No, you certainly don't.
[01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.790]  But now...
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.883]  As far as a state is concerned.
[01:16:02.903 --> 01:16:05.547]  Well, remember the part they found under a rose bush?
[01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:07.470]  Oh, well, that was... I mean, it's getting ridiculous.
[01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:11.236]  Yeah, that was a piece of a centrifuge.
[01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:20.021]  Which could be used, if you had several thousand of them, and they all were operating properly, you could enrich uranium.
[01:16:20.241 --> 01:16:22.923]  Well, centrifuges are used for thousands of applications.
[01:16:22.983 --> 01:16:24.785]  That's right, that's right.
[01:16:24.845 --> 01:16:28.528]  That's like going, look, we found a piece of metal in your backyard.
[01:16:28.548 --> 01:16:30.910]  That means you were planning to make a machine gun.
[01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:35.313]  Well, this guy, we didn't find it.
[01:16:35.354 --> 01:16:37.916]  The guy who was in charge of their...
[01:16:38.836 --> 01:16:39.677]  I think so.
[01:16:39.697 --> 01:16:40.017]  I think so.
[01:17:01.986 --> 01:17:08.732]  The main program, this guy, I've forgotten his name now, was not even involved in that.
[01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:12.476]  He was involved in a separate thing which involved centrifuges.
[01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.572]  They never ever got one to work.
[01:17:17.612 --> 01:17:22.394]  Well, what about the uranium out of, supposedly out of Africa?
[01:17:22.734 --> 01:17:34.118]  I think one reason so many people are blowing the whistle on them goes back to Cheney outing hundreds of CIA assets and reportedly 70 of them getting killed.
[01:17:34.138 --> 01:17:37.900]  I think that's the reason you're seeing people refuse to lie for them now.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.880]  Well, I don't know.
[01:17:40.501 --> 01:17:45.403]  Like I say, I wonder who's paying the rent for David Kaye now.
[01:17:45.563 --> 01:17:50.104]  It was the IAEA until 1992.
[01:17:50.184 --> 01:17:56.467]  He was a bureaucrat for the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is an agency of the United Nations.
[01:17:57.399 --> 01:18:01.421]  And in my opinion, it's the only one worth keeping, but that's neither here nor there.
[01:18:01.961 --> 01:18:03.942]  Because they are effective.
[01:18:04.362 --> 01:18:09.804]  And it's not just... Well, let me give you this... Well, hasn't Iran rolled the red carpet out to them?
[01:18:10.284 --> 01:18:11.504]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:11.784 --> 01:18:12.745]  As did Libya.
[01:18:14.285 --> 01:18:15.286]  As did Iraq.
[01:18:15.446 --> 01:18:16.786]  So what message does that send?
[01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:22.629]  You let people... We're just basically down on bended knees saying, oh, you know, go anywhere you want to.
[01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:25.650]  We do not have any nuclear weapons in this country.
[01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.330]  You know?
[01:18:27.568 --> 01:18:32.432]  And they were, you know, well, we shot them anyway while they were kneeling there.
[01:18:32.952 --> 01:18:45.282]  And what David Kaye is saying, who had some responsibility for us going in there and doing what we did, he's saying, oh, Lord, I see the same thing happening again for a man.
[01:18:45.302 --> 01:18:46.763]  Stay there, doctor.
[01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.405]  We'll be back with physicist James Prather.
[01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.727]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:18:54.707 --> 01:18:56.188]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:18:56.488 --> 01:19:01.069]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:03.750]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:05.511]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:19:05.891 --> 01:19:10.973]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:19:11.293 --> 01:19:12.514]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[01:19:12.554 --> 01:19:15.255]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:19:15.655 --> 01:19:22.699]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:34.686]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[01:19:35.206 --> 01:19:40.708]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:19:54.074 --> 01:19:58.295]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[01:19:59.056 --> 01:20:00.276]  In business and socially,
[01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:07.314]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:20:07.894 --> 01:20:09.615]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[01:20:10.335 --> 01:20:16.318]  While you listen, verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:18.499]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:20:19.059 --> 01:20:21.220]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.821]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:20:24.382 --> 01:20:25.502]  And it's so easy.
[01:20:26.202 --> 01:20:28.203]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:20:29.044 --> 01:20:29.604]  When you want.
[01:20:30.206 --> 01:20:30.826]  Where you want.

[01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:41.751]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:20:53.866 --> 01:20:57.347]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:20:57.607 --> 01:21:01.108]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:05.149]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:11.531]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:21:11.932 --> 01:21:19.854]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:21:20.274 --> 01:21:25.596]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:29.517]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:29.877 --> 01:21:31.778]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:21:31.818 --> 01:21:33.979]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:21:34.219 --> 01:21:39.160]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:56.055]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.756 --> 01:22:01.942]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:22:02.814 --> 01:22:09.718]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:22:10.779 --> 01:22:19.364]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:22:20.464 --> 01:22:28.429]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.
[01:22:29.927 --> 01:22:31.748]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:31.768 --> 01:22:32.209]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:32.269 --> 01:22:32.589]  Call now.
[01:22:32.609 --> 01:22:38.593]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:54.841 --> 01:22:57.603]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:58.164 --> 01:23:01.487]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.269 --> 01:23:10.154]  We've seen some political alchemy that rivals and surpasses George R. Wells' 1984.
[01:23:11.155 --> 01:23:16.059]  Rumsfeld says the weapons are right here outside Decrete.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:17.841]  Decrit, as he says it.
[01:23:18.815 --> 01:23:19.736]  We've got to invade.
[01:23:19.756 --> 01:23:20.657]  We know they have it.
[01:23:21.158 --> 01:23:27.705]  They have David Kaye and all these other people all over the TV news, in front of Congress, saying this.
[01:23:28.286 --> 01:23:31.209]  And then now Rumsfeld says, I never said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:32.390]  It was about elections.
[01:23:33.852 --> 01:23:38.317]  It was never about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:23:38.357 --> 01:23:39.999]  It's like, how dumb do you think we are?
[01:23:40.655 --> 01:23:43.716]  And we had all these fake announcements that we found sarin nerve gas.
[01:23:43.736 --> 01:23:44.276]  We found this.
[01:23:44.596 --> 01:23:48.017]  Always two days later, back of the paper, oh, it was a false alarm.
[01:23:48.057 --> 01:23:48.737]  We didn't find it.
[01:23:49.117 --> 01:23:57.419]  The truth is inspectors have been all over that country, which I think is a dangerous trend, having the UN, the world government in there stomping around being the boss.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.300]  But we're joined by Dr.
[01:24:00.874 --> 01:24:02.395]  James Prather.
[01:24:02.956 --> 01:24:17.207]  Again, sir, continuing about David Kaye, during the break I was talking to you, you said you saw him up in front of Congress, and then we were puzzled and kind of wondering why we see this transformation now, but please continue.
[01:24:17.727 --> 01:24:22.131]  Well, this is before the Gulf War.
[01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:23.592]  It was like in December of 2002.
[01:24:23.632 --> 01:24:25.673]  And David Kaye had appeared as a
[01:24:29.557 --> 01:24:42.805]  I guess you'd call it a CIA expert on the weapons of mass destruction that he said the CIA knew were there in Iraq.
[01:24:42.905 --> 01:24:48.408]  But they kept using the word inspector as if there was some type of independence there.
[01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:55.772]  Well, he had been for about five or six months an inspector back in 1991.
[01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:05.658]  And that was essentially before they discovered that Iraq really had had a nuclear program.
[01:25:05.718 --> 01:25:10.207]  It never got much of anywhere and they were a long ways from even having
[01:25:11.026 --> 01:25:14.188]  ...enriched uranium with which to make a bomb.
[01:25:14.228 --> 01:25:19.410]  And they were years and years away and may never have gotten there.
[01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:21.111]  But they did have a program.
[01:25:21.131 --> 01:25:22.172]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:25:22.412 --> 01:25:25.113]  This is the $64,000 question.
[01:25:25.894 --> 01:25:29.295]  One day Rumsfeld's saying we're going to invade, probably going to invade.
[01:25:29.355 --> 01:25:30.616]  Next day he's saying we aren't.
[01:25:31.516 --> 01:25:33.797]  What are you getting from your contacts in Washington?
[01:25:33.817 --> 01:25:36.878]  I mean, what do you see in your crystal ball really happening?
[01:25:37.178 --> 01:25:39.239]  This is for Iran you're talking about now.
[01:25:39.459 --> 01:25:41.400]  Yes, Iran and Syria as well.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:50.844]  Well, I don't hear anything about Syria because I am primarily interested in preventing nuclear weapons from getting in the hands of terrorists.
[01:25:51.404 --> 01:25:59.547]  And I think most people that are in the nuclear weapons community still in this country, and in Russia, too, also,
[01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:16.907]  That's been one of their prime concerns since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is that somehow or another the terrorists would get a hold of one of our nuclear weapons or one of theirs or enough material to make one on their own.
[01:26:17.007 --> 01:26:17.307]  Okay.
[01:26:17.928 --> 01:26:23.293]  What I had heard was that there was a plan already being developed
[01:26:24.288 --> 01:26:25.509]  I've worked in the Pentagon.
[01:26:25.589 --> 01:26:27.851]  I was Chief Scientist for the Army.
[01:26:28.071 --> 01:26:37.098]  For a while I was in the International Security Affairs Department in the policy side of the Pentagon on the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
[01:26:37.678 --> 01:26:43.963]  That is the place where all of this stuff has been coming out by Douglas Feith and all those people.
[01:26:43.983 --> 01:26:46.705]  The folks that manufactured or
[01:26:47.589 --> 01:26:51.853]  Or collectively got what they called intelligence.
[01:26:51.933 --> 01:26:53.014]  The neocons.
[01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:54.455]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:26:54.636 --> 01:26:57.838]  Dick Cheney going to the CIA, going to the Pentagon ten times.
[01:26:58.599 --> 01:27:00.221]  Yeah, they established this office.
[01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:04.945]  Well, I was in that part of the Pentagon in the Reagan years.
[01:27:05.145 --> 01:27:07.667]  Not now, of course, but in the Reagan years.
[01:27:07.727 --> 01:27:09.189]  I was in that part of the Pentagon.
[01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:13.813]  And back then, didn't the Reagan administration call the neocons the crazies?
[01:27:14.993 --> 01:27:15.213]  What?
[01:27:15.934 --> 01:27:18.775]  I've had other people who were in the Reagan administration.
[01:27:18.976 --> 01:27:21.257]  Didn't they call the current neocons the crazies?
[01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:21.997]  Yeah, right.
[01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:23.338]  Yeah, no doubt about it.
[01:27:23.859 --> 01:27:30.963]  And literally, Richard Perle, who was probably a chief neocrazy or neoconservative, was...
[01:27:32.452 --> 01:27:38.795]  Basically, literally, next door, in the office next door to where I was there for a few months, several months.
[01:27:38.855 --> 01:27:40.875]  His nickname was Prince of Darkness.
[01:27:41.095 --> 01:27:42.836]  Yeah, they call him that.
[01:27:43.196 --> 01:27:54.761]  I first met him, I was working for Senator Bellman of Oklahoma, and Pearl was working for Scoop Jackson, Senator Jackson of Washington, who was generally regarded as a hawk.
[01:27:56.334 --> 01:28:00.516]  He was, in all other respects, a liberal, you know.
[01:28:00.556 --> 01:28:15.665]  I mean, it was just this one issue of, mostly it was the refusal of the Soviet Union to allow free immigration to Israel of Jews, Soviet Jews.
[01:28:16.005 --> 01:28:18.246]  But in any case, that's either here or there.
[01:28:18.266 --> 01:28:25.190]  But that was where Pearl came from, and how he got in the Pentagon in the Reagan years, I do not understand, but at any rate, there he was.
[01:28:26.364 --> 01:28:44.639]  And, uh, well, and we used to, um, the kind of joke around there was, was, uh, if there was anything that was of interest to Israel that was on his desk, uh, one day... Give us the answer on the other side, gotta believe it.
[01:28:44.679 --> 01:28:45.599]  We're on the march.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.681]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.602 --> 01:28:51.284]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.664 --> 01:29:02.169]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.589 --> 01:29:06.812]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:07.053 --> 01:29:14.078]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.459 --> 01:29:20.564]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.584 --> 01:29:21.945]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:22.125 --> 01:29:22.585]  We're good to go.

[01:32:33.238 --> 01:32:35.519]  Before we go back to our guest, I just want to say that
[01:32:39.457 --> 01:32:52.722]  We've seen a shift by hundreds of former Reagan and Bush senior officials, highest levels, four-star generals and admirals, heads of air campaigns, judge advocate general of the Navy.
[01:32:53.002 --> 01:32:54.042]  We've had them all on.
[01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.543]  And they use words like this.
[01:32:55.943 --> 01:32:58.104]  Conspiracy for world domination.
[01:32:58.684 --> 01:32:59.824]  New world order.
[01:33:00.505 --> 01:33:01.645]  National draft.
[01:33:02.125 --> 01:33:03.266]  World War IV.
[01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:06.187]  Because Woolsey says we've already had World War III with the Russians.
[01:33:06.567 --> 01:33:07.047]  The Cold War.
[01:33:08.096 --> 01:33:13.500]  And this is all going on, but the neocons are still talking about going into Iran.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.282]  They've got troops there sneaking around.
[01:33:15.302 --> 01:33:20.425]  There have been bombardments for a year and a half of Syria actually bombing and scraping the Syrians.
[01:33:20.726 --> 01:33:21.806]  That's Associated Press.
[01:33:22.307 --> 01:33:29.032]  Back of the newspaper, though, just this crazy escalation by a bunch of chicken hawks who've never even been in combat.
[01:33:30.197 --> 01:33:32.098]  And it's very, very frightening.
[01:33:32.138 --> 01:33:35.139]  Meanwhile, I want to talk to our guests, and we'll go to your calls.
[01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:38.540]  Pakistan with its scientist Khan Laboratories.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:45.702]  Bush signed W1999, ordering the FBI off of Khan when he got into office in 2001.
[01:33:45.982 --> 01:33:49.063]  Bill Clinton ordered the FBI off of Khan Laboratories.
[01:33:49.363 --> 01:33:51.044]  They're the ones helping arm North Korea.
[01:33:51.284 --> 01:33:55.866]  They're the ones proliferating weapons, according to all the experts we've interviewed.
[01:33:55.946 --> 01:33:56.586]  Dozens here.
[01:33:57.207 --> 01:34:05.245]  So, real threats are our buddies while they're proliferating, and then people that aren't threats are being destabilized.
[01:34:07.119 --> 01:34:15.823]  We're talking to a real expert on this subject, physicist James Prather, and he served in and out of government, chief scientist advising the Army.
[01:34:16.163 --> 01:34:17.243]  It just goes on and on.
[01:34:17.964 --> 01:34:31.410]  And, Dr. Prather, continuing, we went up to the break, and you were talking about what it is, the Israel lobby, using the Pentagon basically as their own private tool when we hit the break.
[01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:32.050]  Please continue.
[01:34:33.405 --> 01:34:56.570]  Well, I just wanted to point out that it's been going on a long time, and of course it's not just something that President Bush thought up, and there's been an enormous amount of support for it, bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle in Congress for more than 20 years, 25 years or so.
[01:35:00.818 --> 01:35:06.062]  Let's go back to the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.
[01:35:07.083 --> 01:35:17.631]  Jackson, in that case, was Senator Scoop Jackson of Washington, who was, in all respects, a liberal Democrat, except for one thing.
[01:35:18.492 --> 01:35:25.056]  And I think it was 75, 76, I don't remember exactly, but I was there at the time when that amendment passed.
[01:35:26.097 --> 01:35:28.179]  And it was...
[01:35:30.232 --> 01:35:32.614]  It was a... what would you call it?
[01:35:33.614 --> 01:35:39.177]  We were imposing sanctions on... not allowing U.S.
[01:35:39.237 --> 01:35:57.508]  companies to do business with the Soviet Union until the President could assure Congress that the Soviet Union was allowing free... there was a tax at the time... free immigration...
[01:35:58.283 --> 01:36:08.756]  And it specifically said, not in the legislation, but in the report that went along with the legislation, that it was the Jews...
[01:36:09.423 --> 01:36:14.484]  That the Soviet Union was not allowing to freely immigrate to Israel.
[01:36:14.664 --> 01:36:22.926]  That was the reason for this so-called Jackson... So it wasn't about American... So it wasn't about American interest.
[01:36:22.966 --> 01:36:24.527]  It was about Israel's interest.
[01:36:24.827 --> 01:36:25.327]  That's right.
[01:36:25.387 --> 01:36:32.109]  And then before the break, you said that Pearl, basically anything that came across his desk that was for Israel, he was pushing it.
[01:36:32.489 --> 01:36:36.050]  Yeah, well, Pearl was Jackson's right-hand man.
[01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:36.670]  And, you know...
[01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:39.871]  He didn't write the legislation.
[01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:40.992]  Senator Jackson did.
[01:36:41.052 --> 01:36:43.614]  But, you know, Pearl probably drafted it.
[01:36:44.174 --> 01:36:58.784]  But in any case, without missing a step of going from working for a Democratic senator, Pearl had a position created for him in the Reagan-Weinberger Pentagon.
[01:36:58.804 --> 01:37:03.247]  It was called the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy.
[01:37:04.287 --> 01:37:20.156]  And the portfolio that Richard Pearl had in that job came out of the office that I was in, and what he took from us was the Middle East and NATO.
[01:37:21.057 --> 01:37:32.283]  The rest of the world stayed where it belonged, which was in the International Security Affairs office, and Pearl then had NATO and essentially Israel, or the Middle East, or whatever you want to call it.
[01:37:33.277 --> 01:37:39.280]  And that's what he did for, I guess, I think he was in that office for six years or so.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:58.829]  So basically they want World War III, and they want to use America as the muscle to do it, and our children's blood to do it, and the so-called conservative talk show hosts don't care if Bush is for open borders, don't care if he's for gun control, they don't care about any real conservative issues anymore, it's all just war, war, war,
[01:37:59.369 --> 01:38:02.712]  Do whatever Israel says, and that's got a lot of people angry.
[01:38:03.072 --> 01:38:15.222]  Now, I want to go to some calls here in a moment, but I want to get, just in a thumbnail sketch, and a few bullet points from you, Doctor, your crystal ball, what do you see happening in the next two years?
[01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:24.029]  Because we know that publicly they're having to back off invading Iran right now, at least with one side of their mouth, but at the same time, they're still making the preparations.
[01:38:24.349 --> 01:38:25.330]  What do you see happening?
[01:38:26.171 --> 01:38:28.953]  Well, what I'm afraid will happen is as follows.
[01:38:30.226 --> 01:38:36.072]  The way we're bogged down in Iraq is throwing off the timetable.
[01:38:36.372 --> 01:38:40.796]  We haven't got any troops to invade Iran, so there's no way that we can do that.
[01:38:41.557 --> 01:38:45.221]  What I'm afraid will happen is that there will be some sort of strike.
[01:38:46.758 --> 01:39:07.588]  Perhaps involving Israel, perhaps not, of the so-called suspected nuclear weapons facilities that people keep telling us are in Iran, which the IAEA, who's on the ground going everywhere they can and checking out all of the tips that they get, can't find.
[01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:11.910]  This is just like it was in Iraq, just before we went into Iraq.
[01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:12.650]  Well, it's just...
[01:39:14.514 --> 01:39:16.935]  Exactly the same kind of things are happening now.
[01:39:17.536 --> 01:39:23.057]  And then basically Iran strikes back and then we've got World War III.
[01:39:23.378 --> 01:39:27.099]  Well, I think it's going to be even more... Here's what I think will happen.
[01:39:28.659 --> 01:39:31.781]  Iraq can shut down... I'm sorry.
[01:39:31.801 --> 01:39:32.801]  Iran.
[01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:34.021]  Okay, we're talking about Iran.
[01:39:34.141 --> 01:39:37.743]  Iran could shut down the Persian Gulf.
[01:39:38.443 --> 01:39:41.484]  Persia, of course, is the old name for Iran.
[01:39:42.839 --> 01:39:44.121]  They have that capability.
[01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:53.156]  If you look at a map, it's just, you know... So, if we or the Israelis or some strange set of people
[01:39:54.529 --> 01:40:04.878]  Raid a bunch of those facilities and kill a bunch of Iranians and maybe some Russians and maybe some IAEA officials and a few other people that happened to be there at the time of the attack.
[01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:07.321]  There's tens of thousands of Chinese there, too.
[01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:08.041]  Yeah.
[01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:14.187]  There will be, at a minimum, the Iranians are going to shut down the Gulf.
[01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:15.268]  At a minimum.
[01:40:16.029 --> 01:40:17.931]  And what may then happen...
[01:40:18.787 --> 01:40:31.117]  Is that they reportedly have something like a million men, and the reason that Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against them, very ineffectively, by the way, because they were not very good chemical weapons.
[01:40:31.337 --> 01:40:32.218]  And they blew back.
[01:40:32.578 --> 01:40:33.279]  Yeah.
[01:40:33.339 --> 01:40:45.849]  The problem was that they were talking about these human waves, millions of not very well-trained soldiers, but anyway, they were a fanatic charging at them.
[01:40:46.549 --> 01:40:47.010]  Now, if
[01:40:47.779 --> 01:41:05.246]  If that happens, if the Iranian forces come into Iraq the way they did when Saddam Hussein felt that he had to use chemical weapons to try to stop them... Our troops will be overrun unless they start using, what, neutron bombs?
[01:41:05.606 --> 01:41:07.767]  No, we don't have any neutron bombs.
[01:41:07.847 --> 01:41:08.928]  That's another fiction.
[01:41:08.968 --> 01:41:12.229]  But at any rate... We don't have any neutron weapons.
[01:41:14.007 --> 01:41:19.872]  The whole concept or the whole thing about neutron bombs is a fiction.
[01:41:20.072 --> 01:41:22.615]  I know Rumsfeld's talking about all these mini-nukes and stuff.
[01:41:22.635 --> 01:41:28.680]  Those are, of course, separate and new, smaller frogs or, you know, tactical weapons.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:29.541]  Is that accurate?
[01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:34.966]  Well, they've been talking about them, but they've been talking about them for more than 20 years.
[01:41:34.986 --> 01:41:38.589]  But our government does possess small frogs, don't they?
[01:41:40.214 --> 01:41:43.377]  I know you're not supposed to talk about it, but you were one of the head people there.
[01:41:43.637 --> 01:41:47.160]  Well, I really was involved in...
[01:41:48.968 --> 01:41:57.833]  And our nuclear weapons program, when it was vibrant and moving ahead and all that sort of thing, but there hasn't been a request from the Department of Defense.
[01:41:58.013 --> 01:41:59.174]  Well, here's my comment, then.
[01:41:59.214 --> 01:42:03.757]  How is the Pentagon going to deal with those mass wave attacks out of Iran into Iraq, then?
[01:42:03.777 --> 01:42:11.421]  We don't have chemical weapons, and we don't have biological weapons, and we haven't got enough troops to hold off a million-man assault.
[01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:16.732]  Obviously, we'll have to use nuclear weapons.
[01:42:16.792 --> 01:42:17.693]  That's where I was going.
[01:42:17.753 --> 01:42:20.054]  So, worse than a neutron bomb, then?
[01:42:20.675 --> 01:42:30.821]  Oh, no, it would be the tactical nuclear weapons that we still have, that we intended to use in the event that the Soviet horde swept into Central Europe.
[01:42:30.881 --> 01:42:34.983]  And that's why they're now softening this up, that, hey, nukes aren't so bad, they're kind of friendly.
[01:42:36.584 --> 01:42:37.965]  Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
[01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:45.051]  But having worked in the development of nuclear weapons, I do not apologize for that.
[01:42:45.311 --> 01:42:49.134]  I think that that was the appropriate thing to do during the Cold War.
[01:42:49.154 --> 01:42:50.415]  Oh, that's another question I have for you.
[01:42:50.435 --> 01:42:57.261]  What about PDD-60 that Clinton did, and that Bush hasn't rescinded, about absorbing a strike before we decide what to do?
[01:42:57.521 --> 01:42:59.082]  Why did they get off mad?
[01:43:01.104 --> 01:43:05.247]  I'm not familiar with that particular directive, so I can't really respond to that.
[01:43:05.347 --> 01:43:07.289]  But what I can tell you is that
[01:43:10.376 --> 01:43:22.358]  In 1991, the Warsaw Pact had already disintegrated, and so obviously there was not going to be a Warsaw Pact versus NATO war.
[01:43:24.178 --> 01:43:32.900]  And the Russians were now, and the Soviet Union still existed at that time, but in 1991 it was clear that the Soviet Union was going to come to pieces too.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:37.121]  But the United States and the Soviet Union
[01:43:38.288 --> 01:43:42.191]  We began to dismantle those tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:45.374]  We had something like 10,000 of them, and so did they.
[01:43:45.394 --> 01:43:51.779]  And we began wanting to dispose peacefully of all these nuclear weapons.
[01:43:52.499 --> 01:44:03.448]  And the United States, even the Congress, Senators Nunn and Lugar and Domenici, when a delegation came to this country, to the Congress, from...
[01:44:07.394 --> 01:44:21.991]  From the Soviet Union and said, look, we want to get rid of all these things, but we don't have the money and we don't have the technical capability to peacefully dispose of all this material that we're going to get out of there.
[01:44:23.994 --> 01:44:24.715]  Will you help us?
[01:44:25.544 --> 01:44:27.226]  And they said, good Lord, yes.
[01:44:27.546 --> 01:44:31.691]  And just one of the quickest things that ever went through Congress.
[01:44:31.751 --> 01:44:35.255]  How does that tie into the current things?
[01:44:35.656 --> 01:44:35.916]  What?
[01:44:36.316 --> 01:44:39.200]  How does that tie into Iran and Iraq?
[01:44:39.821 --> 01:44:54.197]  Well, starting with Clinton, as you said, he never asked for the money to implement the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act.
[01:44:54.437 --> 01:44:57.701]  And so we really haven't made much progress.
[01:44:58.841 --> 01:44:59.321]  Progress.
[01:45:00.182 --> 01:45:04.423]  And getting rid of all of these tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:45:04.463 --> 01:45:06.864]  And now Rumsfeld's got a use for them.
[01:45:06.904 --> 01:45:08.025]  Let's take a few calls here.
[01:45:08.045 --> 01:45:11.466]  I'm going to try to go through these calls quickly, folks, so everybody can get on.
[01:45:11.826 --> 01:45:13.187]  Roger in California, go ahead.
[01:45:13.207 --> 01:45:13.787]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:14.407 --> 01:45:17.288]  I heard Russia and China are getting together on something.
[01:45:17.328 --> 01:45:20.830]  Did you two ever... Yeah, they're having big drills together.
[01:45:20.850 --> 01:45:21.450]  Yeah.
[01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:24.611]  Quote, because they want another bipolar world.
[01:45:24.671 --> 01:45:25.291]  Good question.
[01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:26.892]  Let me get a comment from our guest.
[01:45:26.932 --> 01:45:27.172]  Doctor?
[01:45:27.944 --> 01:45:34.369]  Well, I think that that's what... It sort of follows on what I just got through saying.
[01:45:34.389 --> 01:45:37.112]  The neocons are escalating things.
[01:45:37.252 --> 01:45:37.892]  That's right.
[01:45:37.932 --> 01:45:45.999]  You know, pushing... Undermining the elections and interfering in the elections in Ukraine, for example.
[01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:47.500]  I've been to Ukraine.
[01:45:48.161 --> 01:45:53.385]  And it's... That's dangerous.
[01:45:54.346 --> 01:45:55.587]  You know, that neighbors...
[01:45:56.810 --> 01:46:08.738]  When you think about Russia, you tend to think of those three countries that are now called the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
[01:46:09.198 --> 01:46:13.081]  That'd be like Russia involved in... We're trying to destabilize.
[01:46:13.241 --> 01:46:15.823]  We have, in fact, destabilized Ukraine.
[01:46:16.003 --> 01:46:23.448]  That'd be like Russia involved in, say, the state elections of Texas, Arizona, Mississippi, Louisiana.
[01:46:23.668 --> 01:46:24.769]  That's right, exactly.
[01:46:25.367 --> 01:46:26.788]  That's exactly correct.
[01:46:26.888 --> 01:46:28.249]  Okay, great point.
[01:46:28.829 --> 01:46:30.090]  I'm glad you called, Roger.
[01:46:30.130 --> 01:46:32.171]  Anything else real quick?
[01:46:32.971 --> 01:46:33.491]  You never know.
[01:46:33.531 --> 01:46:37.554]  These guys could get together with guys like Castro and just decide to invade the U.S.
[01:46:37.654 --> 01:46:39.255]  and eliminate us once and for all.
[01:46:39.295 --> 01:46:41.696]  Well, I don't think anybody would bother to
[01:46:42.396 --> 01:46:44.777]  Cross the Atlantic or the Pacific to invade us.
[01:46:44.797 --> 01:46:48.478]  If anybody's going to invade us, I guess it'll have to be Mexico or the Mexicans.
[01:46:48.498 --> 01:46:50.759]  There's a lot of excess Mexicans down there.
[01:46:50.779 --> 01:46:53.960]  And the neocons are paving the way for that, so they just hate America.
[01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:56.841]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[01:46:56.921 --> 01:46:57.722]  John, you're on the air.
[01:46:57.782 --> 01:46:58.202]  Go ahead.
[01:46:58.222 --> 01:47:05.064]  Yeah, I think that kind of boogeyman scaremongering is exactly what the neocons are trying to brainwash us with.
[01:47:05.144 --> 01:47:09.186]  And you mentioned how these neocon crazies had their roots in the Democratic Party.
[01:47:09.776 --> 01:47:23.685]  And the only difference, which is narrowed now, is that the Democrats said, we can use guns and butter, bribe the population with a little bit of social programs to get their assent to these warmongering Cold War policies, the Vietnam War.
[01:47:24.646 --> 01:47:26.527]  They don't even do that much more anymore.
[01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:33.051]  And I think that you pointed out that Scott Ritter, and I read that on ZMAG.org,
[01:47:33.471 --> 01:47:47.466]  Was pointing out that all these advisors, these inspectors, actually knew full well that they were acting as agents for really starving and diseasing a million and a half people to death over there, and that it had nothing to do with weapons.
[01:47:47.686 --> 01:47:55.875]  And I think that if a country looks at what's happened to Iraq like Iran would, they would say, we'd be crazy if we didn't get one-tenth of one percent as a deterrent.
[01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:58.769]  Of the huge nuclear arsenal that's pointing at us.
[01:47:59.149 --> 01:48:07.473]  I believe it's all lies, but at the same time, rather than being trapped with these trick questions by the Pharisees who say, well, we have these... Well, let me stop you, John.
[01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:08.394]  John, let me stop you.
[01:48:08.434 --> 01:48:09.294]  That's a good point.
[01:48:09.835 --> 01:48:16.418]  If this is a world government, folks, if countries aren't allowed to have nuclear weapons, why are we the only people that are allowed to have nuclear weapons?
[01:48:17.118 --> 01:48:20.841]  Why not have global, mad, mutually assured destruction?
[01:48:21.101 --> 01:48:24.283]  Then the whole argument gets into, well, we're the globalists, we're going to decide.
[01:48:24.444 --> 01:48:29.367]  But then I catch the globalists, Don Rumsfeld on the board of ABB, giving reactors in North Korea.
[01:48:29.387 --> 01:48:31.789]  I mean, I actually see them proliferating.
[01:48:32.369 --> 01:48:33.210]  Comments, Doctor?
[01:48:34.791 --> 01:48:44.638]  Well, you covered so many points that I don't know what... I think that if I were Iran, I would do what they are doing, that is...
[01:48:45.354 --> 01:48:51.758]  I agree with your caller that they'd have to be crazy to not want to have nuclear weapons, but that's the hard way to get them.
[01:48:52.219 --> 01:48:59.103]  The better way to do it is to align yourself more closely with both China and Russia.
[01:48:59.464 --> 01:49:05.388]  Now, Russia doesn't need the Iranian oil, but Russia does have
[01:49:08.511 --> 01:49:12.394]  They also sell them a lot of weapons, and that's a strategic partner in the region.
[01:49:12.635 --> 01:49:21.023]  That's right, and those reactors, that's one of the nuclear power reactors that both Russia and China...
[01:49:21.897 --> 01:49:25.079]  Have signed contracts to build in Iran.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:28.202]  That's a big cash cow for them.
[01:49:28.442 --> 01:49:31.844]  Doctor, when we get back, I've got another question for you to be thinking about during the break.
[01:49:32.204 --> 01:49:39.810]  These stories that we've all been hearing about Japan secretly developing because of the Chinese threat.
[01:49:39.850 --> 01:49:41.131]  We'll see if you're aware of that.
[01:49:41.691 --> 01:49:44.233]  We'll be right back with more of your calls with the doctor.
[01:49:44.273 --> 01:49:45.854]  This has been an amazing interview.
[01:49:46.215 --> 01:49:47.836]  You don't want to miss the conclusion of it.
[01:49:48.236 --> 01:49:50.598]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[01:49:54.497 --> 01:49:56.018]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:56.198 --> 01:49:59.301]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:59.421 --> 01:50:03.344]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:03.384 --> 01:50:07.608]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:11.731]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:13.673]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.973 --> 01:50:17.175]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:17.215 --> 01:50:21.917]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:22.077 --> 01:50:25.138]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:25.298 --> 01:50:28.180]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:34.783]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:35.303 --> 01:50:37.145]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:55.465 --> 01:51:06.731]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.

[01:52:25.461 --> 01:52:25.861]  We're good to go.
[01:52:59.847 --> 01:53:04.108]  We're talking about the possibility of World War III, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:04.128 --> 01:53:05.688]  It's a very real possibility.
[01:53:05.708 --> 01:53:13.650]  Global destabilization by the neocons to bring in a world crisis so they can bring you their new world order.
[01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:15.391]  That's the game plan.
[01:53:15.491 --> 01:53:17.951]  Roja, Mike, David, many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:18.451 --> 01:53:29.174]  Our guest, who was the head scientist for the Army, who advised Congress, you name it, the bio goes on and on, who's a conservative himself, worked for a Republican senator,
[01:53:29.938 --> 01:53:33.239]  He is on with us, and the doctor is talking about this threat.
[01:53:33.259 --> 01:53:45.741]  He's going to stay with us about 20 minutes into the next hour, so I have time to go to Roja and Mike and David and all the other people that are holding, and we'll take your questions and comments at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:45.961 --> 01:53:55.363]  Before we go back to the doctor and get into even more serious issues concerning the possibility of World War III, everybody needs to see 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[01:53:56.523 --> 01:53:57.323]  The history...
[01:53:58.271 --> 01:54:11.211]  ...of terrorism in the West and the truth behind 9-11 and now the ensuing lies and the wars and the police state being set up in America that has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:54:12.228 --> 01:54:15.410]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:17.691]  You need to get my Police State films.
[01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:18.592]  I've made three of them.
[01:54:18.952 --> 01:54:23.614]  And I carry a bunch of other great books and videos by the best researchers out there, bar none.
[01:54:24.095 --> 01:54:25.675]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:54:26.136 --> 01:54:28.017]  Go to the Secure Safe online shopping cart.
[01:54:28.057 --> 01:54:30.898]  You can order the films via the Safe Secure shopping cart.
[01:54:31.519 --> 01:54:35.721]  Or you can watch free video clips of the films, read about the different specials that we offer.
[01:54:36.593 --> 01:54:37.214]  We're good to go.
[01:54:37.574 --> 01:54:38.134]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.696 --> 01:55:10.578]  Plus my local TV show that was only available in Austin, but now available via prisonplanet.tv.
[01:55:10.598 --> 01:55:15.219]  And plus all the best interviews we do, like this one, will be posted at prisonplanet.tv as well.
[01:55:15.519 --> 01:55:17.720]  Fifteen cents a day allows us to pay for the bandwidth.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.642]  Doctor continuing, we've got a bunch of calls here, but I'm going to hold those off for the next hour, so folks be patient.
[01:55:26.043 --> 01:55:27.163]  Bringing up Japan.
[01:55:28.078 --> 01:55:33.001]  Now, I read these Reuters articles and these Tokyo Times articles.
[01:55:33.101 --> 01:55:45.668]  I don't know if it's true, but top government officials have said, okay, we're going to develop nuclear weapons to deal with North Korea and China, and we're going to boost our military from purely defensive to offensive.
[01:55:46.108 --> 01:55:50.211]  We don't rule out preemptive strikes since the neocons are calling for this.
[01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:51.291]  Your comments on that?
[01:55:53.072 --> 01:55:57.395]  Well, when I was in the Pentagon, I made...
[01:55:59.050 --> 01:56:12.842]  I went on a couple of trips to Japan and met with the defense minister and people high up in the equivalent of our Pentagon.
[01:56:16.085 --> 01:56:23.791]  It's hard to understand a different culture, but I certainly was of the opinion
[01:56:24.662 --> 01:56:33.113]  That they really were a non-militarist state now as a consequence of the terrible consequences to them of World War II.
[01:56:35.056 --> 01:56:37.900]  But certainly they have the capability.
[01:56:39.814 --> 01:56:43.255]  If they wanted to, to make nuclear weapons.
[01:56:43.316 --> 01:56:55.680]  Well, they have more reactors than France, and in the last two years they've said, we may shift out of this pacifist position, which, frankly, I don't blame them.
[01:56:57.521 --> 01:57:00.082]  Well, they haven't had to do anything because...
[01:57:00.777 --> 01:57:04.442]  We've been defending them, quote unquote, all this time.
[01:57:04.462 --> 01:57:08.087]  You know, we've got military bases all over Japan.
[01:57:08.107 --> 01:57:13.634]  Naval bases and Air Force bases and Okinawa, which is part of Japan.
[01:57:14.295 --> 01:57:14.496]  But...
[01:57:18.773 --> 01:57:19.173]  I don't know.
[01:57:19.213 --> 01:57:23.336]  He mentioned North Korea a little while ago.
[01:57:23.356 --> 01:57:24.236]  Well, I'll tell you what, Doctor.
[01:57:24.276 --> 01:57:25.096]  We've got to break again.
[01:57:25.116 --> 01:57:26.357]  We're going to start the next hour.
[01:57:26.377 --> 01:57:27.678]  We're honored to have you stay with us.
[01:57:28.098 --> 01:57:34.041]  And folks can read his columns at antiwar.com or worldnetdaily.com of all places.
[01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:36.402]  They're even starting to turn around a little bit.
[01:57:36.963 --> 01:57:40.565]  And we'll be back with the third hour with our guests and your calls.
[01:57:40.605 --> 01:57:41.165]  Stay there, Doctor.
[01:57:50.773 --> 01:57:51.413]  Big Brother.
[01:57:52.094 --> 01:57:53.134]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.855 --> 01:57:54.955]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.616 --> 01:57:56.436]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.197 --> 01:57:58.697]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.757 --> 01:58:02.399]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:07.082]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.963 --> 01:58:11.885]  All right, my friends, for those that just joined us,
[01:58:12.879 --> 01:58:30.102]  I'm really honored to have physicist James Gordon Prather on with us, former chief scientist for the Army, top scientist at several of the nuclear laboratories, worked in Congress for a prominent Republican senator, been at the top of major defense policy boards.
[01:58:30.956 --> 01:58:34.358]  And he has a cold today, but he still kept his interview with us.
[01:58:34.778 --> 01:58:36.038]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:58:36.359 --> 01:58:39.140]  Very impressed by his breadth and width of knowledge.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:40.741]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:58:40.761 --> 01:58:44.422]  We're going to go to your calls in this quick segment before we go to break and come back with a longer segment.
[01:58:44.882 --> 01:58:57.068]  But before we take a call, you talked about World War III, going into Iran, if Israel strikes them, then we're sucked into a larger war, which the neocons know full well.
[01:58:57.488 --> 01:58:59.029]  What percentage chance
[01:59:00.453 --> 01:59:15.543]  And I understand this is hypothetical, but what percentage chance do you think that this is going to happen, or are cooler heads going to prevail with real conservatives like yourself in and out of government, and basically will the CIA just refuse to lie again, or what's going to happen?
[01:59:16.864 --> 01:59:21.727]  Well, we all did our best before in 2002, beginning of
[01:59:27.623 --> 01:59:44.134]  As soon as it became obvious, which was the national intelligence estimate that the CIA provided President Bush in September of... Actually, I think it was made public in October of 2002.
[01:59:44.854 --> 01:59:49.357]  And then there was the national security strategy.
[01:59:49.958 --> 01:59:54.561]  There was unclassified portions of that that were made public about that same time.
[01:59:55.387 --> 02:00:15.738]  And those of us who've been there and know how these things work saw the signs and we did everything we could to stop this before it got to the point to where we had 150,000 troops on the border of Iraq ready to go in.
[02:00:16.278 --> 02:00:17.659]  But it didn't work.
[02:00:19.938 --> 02:00:21.759]  We were not able to stop it.
[02:00:22.079 --> 02:00:26.102]  So what do you think the chances are we're going into Iran?
[02:00:26.942 --> 02:00:36.347]  Well, I think the chances that there will be a strike at some of these... First of all, the European Union is presently trying to work out something with Iran.
[02:00:39.444 --> 02:00:56.390]  What the Iranians will get out of it is they will get the Europeans to essentially ignore the sanctions that the United States has put on Iran and has had on Iran for more than 20 years, almost ever since the revolution 26 years ago.
[02:00:56.410 --> 02:01:06.253]  The Europeans basically can't trade with Iran, and yet Iran has got one of the largest oil
[02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:10.852]  Production capabilities in the world.
[02:01:11.092 --> 02:01:12.273]  I think it's second, maybe.
[02:01:13.114 --> 02:01:14.194]  So what do you see happening?
[02:01:14.214 --> 02:01:15.355]  I mean, how do you see the breaks?
[02:01:15.475 --> 02:01:32.647]  Well, I think what will happen is that the Europeans and the Iranians will come to an understanding, and then the administration will say, okay, you've been taken in, you Europeans have been taken in,
[02:01:33.297 --> 02:01:35.278]  The Iranians are going to have nuclear weapons.
[02:01:35.499 --> 02:01:36.519]  We can't have that.
[02:01:36.659 --> 02:01:38.180]  Israel says they can't have it.
[02:01:38.821 --> 02:01:42.924]  And so, there will be... We'll look the other way or something like that.
[02:01:42.984 --> 02:01:46.886]  And there will be a strike at some of these facilities in Iran.
[02:01:47.527 --> 02:01:49.988]  Now, the Iranians are not going to sit still for that.
[02:01:50.789 --> 02:02:01.236]  I don't know what they will do, but if they actually were to invade their neighbor, Iraq...
[02:02:02.037 --> 02:02:02.317]  We're good.
[02:02:26.958 --> 02:02:36.068]  If something like that were to happen again and we're about to have apparently an Islamic government in Iraq that is
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:41.625]  Exceedingly sympathetic to Iran.
[02:02:41.645 --> 02:02:42.826]  We'll be right back with calls.
[02:02:42.946 --> 02:02:44.828]  We'll be right back with the final answer on this.
[02:02:46.249 --> 02:02:50.593]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.753 --> 02:02:55.198]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:55.358 --> 02:02:59.722]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.762 --> 02:03:01.104]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.885 --> 02:03:07.109]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:07.169 --> 02:03:14.116]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:14.236 --> 02:03:16.238]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.598 --> 02:03:27.025]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:27.225 --> 02:03:32.629]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:03:56.867 --> 02:04:04.455]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.735 --> 02:04:07.858]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:07.998 --> 02:04:08.378]  We're good to go.
[02:04:26.658 --> 02:04:32.602]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:04:46.613 --> 02:04:52.878]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pets back in your step.
[02:04:53.098 --> 02:04:58.062]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dads, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[02:04:58.282 --> 02:05:11.553]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[02:05:11.793 --> 02:05:15.036]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[02:05:15.296 --> 02:05:17.638]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[02:05:17.838 --> 02:05:21.680]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:24.963]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[02:05:25.183 --> 02:05:28.685]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[02:05:28.965 --> 02:05:33.048]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition or just trying to beat the clock?
[02:05:33.348 --> 02:05:35.570]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:39.112]  Go to www.LifeWavePromotions.com.

[02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:51.461]  Big Brother.
[02:05:52.121 --> 02:05:53.201]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.881 --> 02:05:54.981]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.642 --> 02:05:56.482]  You want answers?
[02:05:57.222 --> 02:05:58.082]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.782 --> 02:06:02.423]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.963 --> 02:06:07.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.124 --> 02:06:18.087]  All right, Dr. Breither, Pentagon physicist, head scientist for the Army,
[02:06:19.033 --> 02:06:23.076]  Goes on and on, worked with the neocons in amongst them.
[02:06:23.877 --> 02:06:31.643]  A real conservative is going to finish up his story he was telling about what happens, what could happen if there's a strike in Iran, how this is going to play out.
[02:06:32.964 --> 02:06:35.205]  That's how they'll get the war started for the next phase.
[02:06:36.326 --> 02:06:37.287]  We'll go straight to your calls.
[02:06:37.707 --> 02:06:41.330]  But I do now have the videotape from Saturday night.
[02:06:42.412 --> 02:06:49.529]  With Mardi Gras down in Galveston where they had the regular army out searching and arresting citizens saying, oh, they're helping the police.
[02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:51.633]  All part of getting rid of Posse Comitatus.
[02:06:51.694 --> 02:06:52.556]  I want to talk about that.
[02:06:53.331 --> 02:06:55.412]  There's just a bunch of other news that's coming up, folks.
[02:06:55.432 --> 02:06:56.172]  You want to stay with us.
[02:06:56.632 --> 02:06:57.432]  You do not want to miss it.
[02:06:57.892 --> 02:07:03.854]  Dr. Prager, finishing up, your story of Israel does preemptive strikes on Iran.
[02:07:03.894 --> 02:07:05.555]  They've said they're going to do something militarily.
[02:07:06.235 --> 02:07:07.995]  You think it'll be invade Iraq.
[02:07:08.536 --> 02:07:12.957]  And then during the break we were talking, as usual, and you were describing for me what this might look like.
[02:07:14.286 --> 02:07:32.282]  Well, like I say, I don't think anybody intends for it to escalate into a nuclear war, but it could easily do that, and that's probably what will happen, because, you know, the only country on Earth that's used nuclear weapons against people is the United States of America.
[02:07:32.322 --> 02:07:38.307]  And as I say, I was a member of, I worked for, I don't know,
[02:07:39.614 --> 02:07:43.516]  Almost 20 years, I guess, in the nuclear weapons business in this country.
[02:07:44.096 --> 02:07:45.617]  And I don't apologize for that.
[02:07:45.697 --> 02:07:50.299]  I think it was important that we have a nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union.
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:57.923]  But, you know, the Iranians, we don't need to deter them.
[02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:59.944]  They're thousands of miles away.
[02:07:59.964 --> 02:08:03.665]  There's no way in the world that they could really harm us.
[02:08:03.826 --> 02:08:08.628]  Can they admit that if they went full tilt boogie with an open weapons program three to four years?
[02:08:09.958 --> 02:08:11.319]  Do I think that they could do it?
[02:08:12.099 --> 02:08:15.421]  No, first of all, they've got to get a uranium enrichment capability.
[02:08:15.441 --> 02:08:16.802]  They don't have that yet.
[02:08:17.583 --> 02:08:25.208]  And those centrifuges that they've got are basically cast-offs from Pakistan.
[02:08:25.788 --> 02:08:35.154]  Pakistan stole, well, this AQ Khan stole the blueprints and the suppliers list from the Netherlands, from the URINCO.
[02:08:36.094 --> 02:08:38.836]  It's a private sector entity in Europe.
[02:08:39.702 --> 02:08:48.793]  That manufactures most of the enriched uranium for reactor fuel that's used in the world today.
[02:08:50.004 --> 02:08:54.688]  The rest of it is enriched in Russia, also using centrifuges.
[02:08:55.449 --> 02:09:01.435]  In this country, we don't have any gas centrifuge enrichment capability.
[02:09:01.495 --> 02:09:03.517]  We never have ever built a plant like that.
[02:09:05.058 --> 02:09:10.904]  But the plants that the Iranians are in the process of building
[02:09:11.815 --> 02:09:11.875]  Yes.
[02:09:11.895 --> 02:09:14.856]  They are essentially first generation gas centrifuge plants.
[02:09:15.496 --> 02:09:15.876]  I don't know.
[02:09:15.916 --> 02:09:25.119]  They talk about having 50,000 of the things in order to enrich just uranium for reactor fuel.
[02:09:25.739 --> 02:09:31.901]  I don't know how long it would take them, since I say we don't have that capability in this country.
[02:09:32.041 --> 02:09:34.901]  I've never even been in a room with a gas centrifuge.
[02:09:37.449 --> 02:09:54.738]  The point is, is that when the President of the United States gets up in the State of the Union address and demands that Iran give up its uranium enrichment program, which it has a perfect right under the treaty that it's... Well, they play word games.
[02:09:54.758 --> 02:09:56.419]  They say the word nuclear.
[02:09:56.619 --> 02:10:01.722]  Well, I mean, nuclear, that could be an x-ray machine in the dental office, according to their definitions.
[02:10:02.022 --> 02:10:06.825]  He specifically stated in his State of the Union message, uranium enrichment.
[02:10:07.384 --> 02:10:08.505]  He actually said that.
[02:10:08.885 --> 02:10:12.568]  He demanded that they give up their uranium enrichment program.
[02:10:12.989 --> 02:10:15.111]  Well, they've made it very clear they're not going to do that.
[02:10:16.392 --> 02:10:35.468]  And I expect that there will be an agreement reached between the European Union and Iran, which will essentially mean that the European Union, Germany, France, England, will
[02:10:36.525 --> 02:10:40.687]  Essentially, what would you say?
[02:10:40.827 --> 02:10:47.611]  Ignore the sanctions that we have had on... Well, I mean, look, even our little buddy England has said they're not going along with this because... That's right.
[02:10:47.691 --> 02:10:50.732]  Because Iran's not a threat, but the globalists want this war.
[02:10:51.053 --> 02:11:05.220]  Let's take some calls, quickly callers... But if we get rid of those sanctions, I mean, if the Europeans ignore the sanctions and the Chinese and the Russians start shipping them all of this stuff that they want, that, you know...
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:13.847]  I suspect that Israel and a few other people will say we've got to somehow or another stop this.
[02:11:13.867 --> 02:11:20.092]  But if Israel knows it's not a threat, why do they want to attack Iran so bad?
[02:11:21.274 --> 02:11:22.355]  I don't know that.
[02:11:22.515 --> 02:11:23.396]  I have no idea.
[02:11:23.516 --> 02:11:26.699]  Knowing that that will endanger Israel, that will escalate things.
[02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:28.480]  Maybe that's what they want.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:29.001]  I don't know.
[02:11:30.134 --> 02:11:31.135]  It's bizarre.
[02:11:31.875 --> 02:11:34.698]  Roja in Kansas and Mike, David, and Chris.
[02:11:34.738 --> 02:11:35.478]  Roja, go ahead.
[02:11:36.079 --> 02:11:36.439]  Okay.
[02:11:36.539 --> 02:11:38.200]  I watch C-SPAN every day.
[02:11:38.901 --> 02:11:42.263]  And so this morning there were two men on one.
[02:11:42.824 --> 02:11:43.805]  They were both journalists.
[02:11:44.465 --> 02:11:45.906]  One was from the U.K.
[02:11:46.126 --> 02:11:47.387]  The other was from Germany.
[02:11:47.948 --> 02:11:51.110]  The man from Germany was named Chico Bitt.
[02:11:51.831 --> 02:11:57.936]  A person called in, a man, and asked him had he ever seen InfoAwards.com.
[02:11:59.085 --> 02:12:00.506]  Mr. Trekovitz said, no.
[02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:03.226]  He said, well, I have three questions for you.
[02:12:03.266 --> 02:12:05.647]  He asked, why did we go to war?
[02:12:05.687 --> 02:12:06.547]  Was it over oil?
[02:12:06.567 --> 02:12:11.049]  Mr. Trekovitz, this is a quote, he said, oil was a side issue.
[02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:18.611]  The second question was, then, why did Tony Blair and George Bush make up the story about the WMD?
[02:12:19.391 --> 02:12:27.574]  Mr. Trekovitz answered, it was not in the interest of either the United States nor Europe, but any person on the face of this earth
[02:12:28.106 --> 02:12:29.789]  To have weapons of any sort.
[02:12:30.670 --> 02:12:32.052]  Then he asked, why?
[02:12:32.072 --> 02:12:34.075]  Did we then go to war?
[02:12:34.396 --> 02:12:41.066]  He said that under the Bush administration, that their goal is to establish a new world order.
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:44.940]  Well, that's what we're talking about.
[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:46.321]  They're setting up world government.
[02:12:46.361 --> 02:12:55.683]  I mean, what, a couple months ago there was a New York Times article where Rove was quoted saying, we're an empire now, and we make reality, and we'll change reality day to day.
[02:12:55.703 --> 02:12:57.884]  I mean, it's getting... Let me ask the doctor this.
[02:12:57.904 --> 02:12:59.144]  I mean, you've worked around these people.
[02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:00.825]  Have they become delusional?
[02:13:01.165 --> 02:13:05.166]  You know, kind of that power sickness that a lot of people get throughout history.
[02:13:05.186 --> 02:13:06.166]  Do you think they're delusional?
[02:13:07.687 --> 02:13:09.707]  Well, yeah, I think that's one way to put it.
[02:13:11.167 --> 02:13:11.468]  I think...
[02:13:15.209 --> 02:13:18.851]  When you start saying you control reality... I've been in the service.
[02:13:18.911 --> 02:13:31.775]  I was a naval officer for 10 years, but most of that time I was not on active duty, but nevertheless I had a commission for all that time, and I was in the nuclear weapons business while I was a naval officer.
[02:13:36.077 --> 02:13:41.279]  So I know something about the military and the way they think, and then I've been in the Pentagon and all that sort of thing.
[02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:50.301]  And, of course, the only way to get promoted is to have wars, you know?
[02:13:51.482 --> 02:13:57.306]  And if you have little wars every now and then, you know, you get to be a Colin Powell or something like that.
[02:13:57.366 --> 02:14:06.434]  You get to go from being an NYU graduate all the way up to being chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:14:06.494 --> 02:14:08.255]  So it's a way to make themselves heroes.
[02:14:08.796 --> 02:14:11.378]  Well, I mean, you know, if you tell them to go to war...
[02:14:12.635 --> 02:14:17.018]  That's what they do for a living, and that's the way you get promoted, and so they're going to go do that.
[02:14:17.359 --> 02:14:35.932]  Now, you try to keep it so that it's just a small war, that it doesn't just get completely out of hand, but these people seem to think that we now have the power, or at least they thought that until they invaded Iraq, that we can do it from 20,000 feet on the cheap with no casualties.
[02:14:36.557 --> 02:14:42.321]  And the only people that are going to get hurt are the people that dared to stand up to us.
[02:14:42.722 --> 02:14:56.692]  Now, let's hope that the military, the green suitors and the blue suitors in the Pentagon can reason with these people in saying, don't start something that's going to result in us...
[02:14:59.744 --> 02:15:02.205]  Having another Custer's Last Stand, you know?
[02:15:02.865 --> 02:15:04.165]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:15:04.566 --> 02:15:06.086]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:15:06.166 --> 02:15:06.766]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:15:08.047 --> 02:15:08.727]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[02:15:08.747 --> 02:15:09.347]  Dr. Prather.
[02:15:09.367 --> 02:15:23.371]  I sense, Dr. Prather, that you're a very patriotic man, and you were concerned about the threat that Russia posed for many years, but you may have been kind of boxed in by the same mindset that most Americans have, I think.
[02:15:23.431 --> 02:15:27.233]  And I don't mean to sound patronizing, but following up on the last caller,
[02:15:29.127 --> 02:15:45.295]  Do you appreciate that really the same people who issue orders to our government, to Mr. Bush, are the people who built up Russia to be the threat that we have to worry about for many years, and who put Mao in power in China?
[02:15:47.296 --> 02:15:55.961]  These people actually see Russia and China as the models that they want to build the world on, and America is simply an impediment to them.
[02:15:57.814 --> 02:16:04.897]  I guess I'm not sure I understood the question.
[02:16:04.997 --> 02:16:16.923]  Do I think that the threat, the communist threat from the Cold War was overblown or underestimated?
[02:16:16.963 --> 02:16:26.168]  Western institutions, and this has gone public, helped finance a lot of it, and now they've come out and admitted that elements of our government helped put Mao into power.
[02:16:28.122 --> 02:16:29.543]  I don't know anything about that.
[02:16:29.983 --> 02:16:38.810]  At the time, I believed that the Soviet Union really did pose a threat to us.
[02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:55.244]  I think they still do, but they do because precisely the people who can move a Richard Perle from obscurity into a high post in the Pentagon also can move vast amounts of money into Russia and build them into a threat.
[02:16:57.252 --> 02:17:12.222]  Yeah, well, it's certainly clear that if any country can absorb a first nuclear strike, it's China.
[02:17:12.242 --> 02:17:16.064]  You know, they've got, what is it, 1.3 billion people or something like that.
[02:17:16.304 --> 02:17:19.406]  Didn't Jiang Zemin, his predecessor, said that?
[02:17:20.647 --> 02:17:22.208]  That they could absorb a first strike.
[02:17:22.368 --> 02:17:23.529]  And they don't care about their people.
[02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:25.150]  Well, you know...
[02:17:26.285 --> 02:17:28.587]  I don't know that much about... They're a human resource.
[02:17:28.747 --> 02:17:30.067]  Never been to mainland China.
[02:17:30.088 --> 02:17:32.229]  I've been to, of course, Taiwan.
[02:17:32.269 --> 02:17:38.933]  We've already had you for about an hour and 15 minutes, but just one more break, one more quick segment, so we can go to two final calls.
[02:17:38.953 --> 02:17:39.833]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:17:40.534 --> 02:17:41.194]  With our guests.
[02:17:41.614 --> 02:17:42.235]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.917 --> 02:17:48.438]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:17:48.899 --> 02:17:53.201]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:17:53.601 --> 02:17:54.402]  It still is.
[02:17:54.923 --> 02:17:55.523]  We're good to go.

[02:19:02.822 --> 02:19:08.806]  While you listen, verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:19:09.426 --> 02:19:11.007]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:19:11.548 --> 02:19:13.689]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:19:14.290 --> 02:19:16.251]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:19:16.861 --> 02:19:17.941]  And it's so easy.
[02:19:18.662 --> 02:19:20.702]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:19:21.502 --> 02:19:22.142]  When you want.
[02:19:22.663 --> 02:19:23.323]  Where you want.

[02:19:32.825 --> 02:19:34.226]  1-800-419-WORD That's 419-W-O-R-D 1-800-419-WORD
[02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:49.071]  The war on terrorism.
[02:19:49.392 --> 02:19:52.175]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:52.435 --> 02:19:56.600]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:57.861]  So what do you do?
[02:19:58.182 --> 02:20:02.747]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:03.227 --> 02:20:05.348]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:05.848 --> 02:20:20.535]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:20.575 --> 02:20:27.658]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:27.998 --> 02:20:32.400]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:34.841]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438 That's 888-803-4438
[02:20:47.290 --> 02:20:54.576]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:20:54.956 --> 02:20:59.639]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:03.723]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:21:03.963 --> 02:21:06.905]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen...
[02:21:07.265 --> 02:21:22.900]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:21:23.221 --> 02:21:29.507]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[02:21:29.767 --> 02:21:34.030]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.920]  All right, final segment with our guest.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:03.721]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:22:04.221 --> 02:22:08.822]  Chris, you're on the air here on the Alex Jones Show with physicist James Prather.
[02:22:09.062 --> 02:22:10.562]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:22:11.062 --> 02:22:13.163]  Yes, thank you very much for having this guest on.
[02:22:13.223 --> 02:22:15.483]  We need more people like him out there to be serving.
[02:22:16.223 --> 02:22:21.004]  I had an article in the paper about a new tracker chip that they want to put into waste management trucks.
[02:22:21.504 --> 02:22:25.325]  And they wanted to put it in where, well, it's supposed to, if they get lost, it's supposed to save money.
[02:22:25.405 --> 02:22:29.646]  And I went on and read this, and it frustrated me because they want to do this worldwide.
[02:22:30.174 --> 02:22:32.536]  Well, here's the New World Order coming in to wherever you look.
[02:22:32.556 --> 02:22:37.159]  No, then it scans the RFID that are in all the products, and that's the industry's own documents.
[02:22:37.199 --> 02:22:47.647]  I think the question you're bringing up to our guest, and he's an expert on nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation, was the head scientist for the Army on this, and worked around and in amongst the neocons.
[02:22:47.687 --> 02:22:55.493]  But the police state here in America, the neocons, Doctor, as I'm sure you know, aren't just trying to take over the world.
[02:22:55.513 --> 02:22:57.815]  They're also getting rid of the Bill of Rights here in America.
[02:22:59.582 --> 02:23:22.502]  Well, I'm not quite an expert on that sort of thing, but I do know, now that I live back in New Mexico again, I left Washington about a year ago, Washington, D.C., returned to New Mexico, which is where I came from, that there are an awful lot of people now in this country that have a vested interest in the war on terror.
[02:23:22.562 --> 02:23:24.704]  That is, the Homeland Security Department
[02:23:25.347 --> 02:23:30.854]  While other industries are shutting down, the economy is shifting almost totally into prisons and security and surveillance.
[02:23:30.874 --> 02:23:32.075]  I just don't.
[02:23:43.803 --> 02:23:48.105]  I don't understand how the commercial airline industry is doing as well as it's doing.
[02:23:48.145 --> 02:23:55.328]  I mean, they're having record losses, billions of dollars a year, and they can't keep that up indefinitely, I wouldn't think.
[02:23:55.948 --> 02:24:03.472]  But I've only flown, I guess, in the last year three times, and that involves moving out here.
[02:24:03.792 --> 02:24:10.875]  When I moved out here, I had to make a couple... Well, they got that $25 billion payoff to shut their mouths about 9-11.
[02:24:11.355 --> 02:24:12.196]  That's a big part of it.
[02:24:12.216 --> 02:24:12.976]  Anything else, Chris?
[02:24:13.496 --> 02:24:19.221]  Yeah, I just want to also, during the Iraqi elections, many Iraqi Americans here are very aware of what's happening.
[02:24:19.241 --> 02:24:22.924]  They know about the CIA putting Saddam in power, and they know about a new world order.
[02:24:22.944 --> 02:24:24.645]  Those elections were totally staged.
[02:24:24.685 --> 02:24:25.046]  They were.
[02:24:25.066 --> 02:24:26.127]  They really were.
[02:24:26.147 --> 02:24:29.790]  And there was a handful of Iraqis that I talked to who said, this is the most staged election that I've ever seen.
[02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:31.171]  It's about a new world order.
[02:24:31.711 --> 02:24:33.973]  And always the media says, well, they're all for it.
[02:24:33.993 --> 02:24:34.793]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:24:34.933 --> 02:24:36.994]  They do know what's going on when you talk with these people.
[02:24:38.195 --> 02:24:38.736]  I hear you.
[02:24:38.956 --> 02:24:40.196]  William in California.
[02:24:40.216 --> 02:24:40.857]  You're on the air.
[02:24:40.897 --> 02:24:42.058]  Last caller for our guest.
[02:24:42.118 --> 02:24:42.598]  Go ahead.
[02:24:42.778 --> 02:24:42.978]  Hi.
[02:24:43.018 --> 02:24:43.879]  Great show, Alex.
[02:24:44.739 --> 02:24:50.063]  The Cheney Energy Report of 2001 basically laid out exactly what they're doing now.
[02:24:50.203 --> 02:24:58.308]  They want to double the oil production of the Middle East from 15 million barrels a day to 30 to cover our needs for oil in the next 20 years.
[02:24:59.195 --> 02:25:09.200]  The way they say they're going to do that is dominate Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait militarily and politically so we can force them to increase their oil production.
[02:25:09.665 --> 02:25:15.810]  And they won't do it without our military occupation because it's not in their best interest to pump their oil fast.
[02:25:15.930 --> 02:25:17.772]  Well, this is a question for the doctor.
[02:25:17.812 --> 02:25:28.160]  I mean, obviously oil's a big part of it, but also it's weapons sales, you've got to have a new war, and it's about scaring every other country, whether it's Latin America or Asia, into following orders.
[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:31.944]  It's about unifying a bipolar world under a new world order.
[02:25:31.984 --> 02:25:32.624]  Comments, doctor?
[02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:35.887]  Well, just what I said earlier, that...
[02:25:36.736 --> 02:25:44.501]  The ties between Russia and China and Iran are growing by the day.
[02:25:44.901 --> 02:25:58.210]  And one of the principal reasons the European Union at the present time is trying to negotiate this deal with the Iranians is because they're scared to death that China is going to take all of the oil from Iran
[02:26:01.724 --> 02:26:04.926]  And from Russia, of course, that they are dependent upon.
[02:26:04.946 --> 02:26:08.068]  Well, I've talked to a lot of Europeans, and I read their newspapers.
[02:26:08.129 --> 02:26:09.830]  They're worried about Putin.
[02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:11.671]  Why is Europe so afraid of Putin?
[02:26:13.232 --> 02:26:13.452]  Me?
[02:26:13.592 --> 02:26:14.573]  I have no idea.
[02:26:14.593 --> 02:26:26.641]  I think he's probably at least maybe even better than we deserve as a guy in charge of that mess over there trying to straighten it out.
[02:26:26.661 --> 02:26:26.681]  I...
[02:26:31.667 --> 02:26:37.669]  I think his reaction to what the United States did in Ukraine is perfectly understandable.
[02:26:38.589 --> 02:26:48.012]  He'd have to be crazy not to object to essentially the neo-crazies pushing the borders of NATO right up to Russia again.
[02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:48.512]  All right.
[02:26:48.692 --> 02:26:53.853]  We're back in the same situation where we had the Warsaw Pact and the NATO standoff.
[02:26:53.973 --> 02:26:55.474]  Let me ask you one final question.
[02:26:55.494 --> 02:26:56.454]  Thanks for the call, William.
[02:26:56.894 --> 02:27:02.555]  How many conservatives, people from the Reagan administration, like yourself, are upset about what's happening?
[02:27:03.215 --> 02:27:03.636]  I don't know.
[02:27:03.656 --> 02:27:09.837]  The chief spokesman we have these days is Pat Buchanan, and he speaks for an awful lot of us.
[02:27:13.172 --> 02:27:14.053]  Very interesting.
[02:27:14.273 --> 02:27:14.734]  All right.
[02:27:14.894 --> 02:27:20.759]  But then you see, Pat, sometimes, you know, like during the war, well, he was suddenly all for it, so he's kind of been flip-flopping.
[02:27:20.899 --> 02:27:28.306]  Well, what he said, I think, was, once you're in there, you know, you've got to... And he's right.
[02:27:28.326 --> 02:27:29.608]  You know, it's a tar baby.
[02:27:29.748 --> 02:27:30.689]  We're stuck.
[02:27:30.769 --> 02:27:32.651]  Now they want us to jump into another tar baby.
[02:27:32.871 --> 02:27:33.972]  Thanks for joining us, Doctor.
[02:27:34.492 --> 02:27:34.873]  Take care.
[02:27:36.874 --> 02:27:37.775]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.276 --> 02:27:39.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.802 --> 02:27:43.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.844 --> 02:27:49.927]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[02:27:50.247 --> 02:27:52.549]  Not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[02:27:52.770 --> 02:27:59.896]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:28:00.096 --> 02:28:05.481]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:28:05.742 --> 02:28:10.386]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[02:28:10.486 --> 02:28:11.126]  See you next time.
[02:28:29.199 --> 02:28:34.025]  Reclaim that youthful and energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of Minerals from the Sea.
[02:28:34.225 --> 02:28:35.847]  Call for Sea Minerals today at 877-817-9829.

[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:51.965]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.105 --> 02:28:58.270]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.530 --> 02:29:06.977]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.237 --> 02:29:14.243]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.543 --> 02:29:19.386]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.586 --> 02:29:24.990]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:28.412]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.753 --> 02:29:36.698]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.758 --> 02:29:37.318]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.824 --> 02:29:48.327]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:29:49.007 --> 02:29:58.656]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:29:59.657 --> 02:30:09.126]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:30:10.206 --> 02:30:15.711]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:30:16.512 --> 02:30:24.238]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.
[02:30:24.899 --> 02:30:26.841]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:26.861 --> 02:30:27.201]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:34.875 --> 02:30:35.396]  516-8736.
[02:30:39.204 --> 02:30:39.905]  Call now.
[02:30:40.085 --> 02:30:43.752]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[02:30:52.817 --> 02:30:55.840]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:59.043]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:30:59.443 --> 02:31:02.425]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[02:31:02.686 --> 02:31:05.428]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[02:31:05.748 --> 02:31:08.491]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know.
[02:31:08.831 --> 02:31:11.733]  I'm working for the state, I'm the highway patrol.
[02:31:13.074 --> 02:31:14.275]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:31:15.156 --> 02:31:18.259]  I'll just take a few more calls, Roger and others that are holding.
[02:31:19.867 --> 02:31:27.253]  After I cover some news, other news issues other than World War III being served up hot and ready for you.
[02:31:29.094 --> 02:31:30.735]  All the inspectors there.
[02:31:31.576 --> 02:31:34.899]  Iran putting up with foreign domination, which I think is pathetic.
[02:31:35.379 --> 02:31:36.240]  UN control.
[02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:38.661]  And they've been all over the country.
[02:31:38.701 --> 02:31:41.303]  There's nothing even approaching a nuclear weapons program.
[02:31:41.343 --> 02:31:42.244]  Globalists don't care.
[02:31:42.264 --> 02:31:48.469]  They're going to let America play the part of the bad cop and let Israel play the part of the bad cop and strike Iran.
[02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:51.091]  And then Iran is not going to be a pushover.
[02:31:51.111 --> 02:31:53.332]  They're going to go absolutely ape.
[02:31:53.372 --> 02:31:59.974]  You see, Iraq was because Saddam's entire force had basically been trained here in the U.S., all his officers.
[02:32:00.014 --> 02:32:00.634]  They were allies.
[02:32:01.215 --> 02:32:04.656]  So the globalists knew the inside workings and could pay them off before the war.
[02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:06.597]  You can't do that with Iran.
[02:32:08.177 --> 02:32:09.878]  And it's going to be a mess.
[02:32:10.398 --> 02:32:12.199]  Israel says they could attack them any day.
[02:32:12.219 --> 02:32:14.540]  It could be this week or two years from now.
[02:32:16.006 --> 02:32:17.887]  Then we're going to be in serious trouble.
[02:32:18.207 --> 02:32:19.547]  Why is Israel going to do this?
[02:32:19.727 --> 02:32:33.911]  We just had one of the chief strategists in the Reagan and then first Bush administration, the head of the Army's board, studying the science, one of the head people at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, telling you all this.
[02:32:34.532 --> 02:32:37.372]  They use terms like global government, New World Order.
[02:32:38.053 --> 02:32:38.793]  This is real.
[02:32:38.833 --> 02:32:39.573]  This is happening.
[02:32:40.173 --> 02:32:42.354]  They need this global crisis to get this done.
[02:32:43.809 --> 02:32:45.711]  And you heard him say the generals want wars.
[02:32:45.751 --> 02:32:46.792]  They want to be hot shots.
[02:32:47.993 --> 02:32:49.474]  And our children die in the process.
[02:32:49.494 --> 02:32:56.501]  Meanwhile, while our government stood by and really helped arm Pakistan, our government stood by and helped arm North Korea.
[02:32:56.601 --> 02:32:57.962]  Oh, but they're not a problem.
[02:32:58.082 --> 02:32:59.083]  It's Iran.
[02:33:00.044 --> 02:33:01.725]  Iran, Iran, Iran.
[02:33:01.745 --> 02:33:05.429]  And you can sit there in your easy chair and go and kill them Iranians.
[02:33:05.529 --> 02:33:07.571]  Well, your sons and daughters are going to have to do that.
[02:33:08.752 --> 02:33:10.113]  And they're conservatively
[02:33:11.666 --> 02:33:13.809]  Ten times the problem that Saddam was.
[02:33:15.331 --> 02:33:16.472]  That is, if you attack them.
[02:33:17.894 --> 02:33:21.058]  It's very, very, very serious.
[02:33:21.158 --> 02:33:26.325]  And the Iranians in their history, the Persians don't go around attacking people.
[02:33:26.825 --> 02:33:28.888]  But if you attack them, you're going to have a major problem.
[02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:30.908]  The globalists don't care.
[02:33:31.428 --> 02:33:33.310]  They love a nuke to go off in the U.S.
[02:33:33.330 --> 02:33:36.592]  They love hysteria to have the national draft.
[02:33:36.632 --> 02:33:37.112]  And see?
[02:33:37.773 --> 02:33:40.435]  We tried to stop their reactors and they attacked us.
[02:33:40.575 --> 02:33:46.859]  Or the globalists could blow up one of their reactors and then blow something up here and claim they did it.
[02:33:46.899 --> 02:33:50.382]  We have the official government plans, like Northwoods, to carry this out.
[02:33:50.462 --> 02:33:51.543]  Or the PNAC documents.
[02:33:53.012 --> 02:33:58.515]  And to see Operation Northwoods and PNAC, you need to get the Masters of Terror, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:33:58.535 --> 02:34:01.197]  You need to get Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:34:02.117 --> 02:34:03.178]  That gets into all of that.
[02:34:03.198 --> 02:34:04.939]  You need to get these videos.
[02:34:05.019 --> 02:34:05.999]  Make copies of them.
[02:34:06.039 --> 02:34:07.080]  Buy another VCR.
[02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:08.120]  Burn DVDs.
[02:34:08.501 --> 02:34:10.442]  Give them to friends and family and neighbors.
[02:34:11.262 --> 02:34:20.087]  Because if you won't take action and warn people, if you won't take action and get these videos out to people, if you won't take action and educate your neighbors...
[02:34:22.146 --> 02:34:29.451]  Look, we have the majority on our side, the thinking people, the conservatives, the quote liberals, at the grassroots level.
[02:34:29.491 --> 02:34:31.132]  We just don't have the people in power.
[02:34:31.893 --> 02:34:38.158]  We have got to get to the point where their own minions refuse to go along with them, which is happening more and more.
[02:34:39.479 --> 02:34:42.561]  Folks, I've got a 9-11 special I'm still offering.
[02:34:43.562 --> 02:34:45.043]  My 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:45.664 --> 02:34:46.504]  Masters of Terror.
[02:34:46.664 --> 02:34:47.765]  My two 9-11 films.
[02:34:48.666 --> 02:34:49.947]  Five hours of video plus.
[02:34:51.846 --> 02:34:58.989]  George Humphreys, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, Eric Huffman's 9-11, The Great Deception, Painful Deception.
[02:34:59.869 --> 02:35:00.909]  Four videos.

[02:35:15.055 --> 02:35:16.635]  Maybe you already own one of the videos.
[02:35:16.975 --> 02:35:18.916]  Give the other as a gift when you get it.
[02:35:19.611 --> 02:35:20.333]  Get the films.
[02:35:20.453 --> 02:35:21.155]  Give them to people.
[02:35:21.215 --> 02:35:22.397]  Put them on AXS TV.
[02:35:22.838 --> 02:35:24.081]  Get them out to folks.
[02:35:24.202 --> 02:35:25.204]  Get them out to people.

[02:36:39.131 --> 02:36:39.932]  Roger, go ahead.
[02:36:41.712 --> 02:36:43.113]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:36:43.173 --> 02:36:46.214]  I want to ask the folks to grab their pens.
[02:36:46.274 --> 02:36:51.956]  I'd like to give a legislative update here on five or six bills, so I'm asking for a little space of time here.
[02:36:52.996 --> 02:36:55.517]  Unfortunately, there's a lot... Well, you have to tell the folks what the bills are.
[02:36:55.717 --> 02:37:02.039]  Yeah, of course, and I'm going to give the toll free to the Capitol Hill switchboard, and one of these might be show through by tomorrow, yet that would be the...
[02:37:03.758 --> 02:37:20.127]  The bill perhaps to protect vaccine makers from lawsuits and forbid notification, warning about any direct, indirect, or by implication any safety issue with any vaccine.
[02:37:20.147 --> 02:37:20.587]  That's right.
[02:37:20.627 --> 02:37:32.613]  A law where they can force experimental vaccines on you and not tell you what's in them, take off of the printed material even for the doctors, and give them liability protection when you drop dead or go into a coma.
[02:37:32.953 --> 02:37:35.076]  Yes, and here's what's really critical about this.
[02:37:35.096 --> 02:37:41.463]  This is going to be disgustingly combined in the same bill with increasing the death benefits to survivors and service members.
[02:37:41.683 --> 02:37:47.910]  That's what they do, and then you're against the troops because you don't want us giving them experimental vaccines illegally.
[02:37:47.930 --> 02:37:51.614]  Yeah, so tell them you want that separated into two separate bills, and that's S3.
[02:37:53.516 --> 02:37:56.178]  That's the bill to protect vaccine makers from lawsuits.
[02:37:56.358 --> 02:37:57.539]  That's right, S3.
[02:37:57.739 --> 02:37:59.520]  Now the next one is HR 181.
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:02.042]  I think this is Ron Paul sponsored.
[02:38:02.122 --> 02:38:08.146]  It's to require parental consent for biological testing, psychological testing of children.
[02:38:09.107 --> 02:38:09.287]  HR 181.
[02:38:09.407 --> 02:38:12.169]  Yeah, he's trying to block the funding for New Freedom.
[02:38:12.702 --> 02:38:15.124]  Yeah, no, the next one, so vote for that one.
[02:38:15.545 --> 02:38:19.388]  The next one, vote against H.R.
[02:38:20.069 --> 02:38:21.590]  418, the Real ID Act.
[02:38:21.810 --> 02:38:23.392]  That's a sense in front of Section 1.
[02:38:23.452 --> 02:38:29.177]  And that adds on to the National ID card passed December 16th of 2004, a month and a half ago.
[02:38:29.437 --> 02:38:35.463]  That adds it to be a regional ID card for the Americas, unifying the biometric code data.
[02:38:35.803 --> 02:38:37.624]  Yeah, that's one other lovely feature.
[02:38:37.744 --> 02:38:44.347]  Proposes to suspend any and all laws south of San Diego for construction of some highway or whatever, I forget exactly.
[02:38:44.387 --> 02:38:50.810]  But while the bill mentions San Diego, it doesn't limit the compass of the law to that area.
[02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:52.451]  So that could be anywhere in the U.S.
[02:38:52.511 --> 02:38:53.552]  to suspend laws.
[02:38:53.572 --> 02:38:55.413]  How's that for a treat?
[02:38:55.693 --> 02:38:57.433]  Sounds like freedom to me.
[02:38:57.454 --> 02:38:59.254]  So vote against H.R. 418.
[02:39:01.316 --> 02:39:02.496]  Next one is H.R.
[02:39:02.516 --> 02:39:06.499]  259, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005.
[02:39:06.699 --> 02:39:09.962]  Which should be dubbed the Orwellian Thought Crime Legislation.
[02:39:10.802 --> 02:39:11.523]  Again, H.R.
[02:39:12.543 --> 02:39:13.684]  259, against that one.
[02:39:14.204 --> 02:39:22.250]  The next one is, I don't have a bill number, it's just the Social Security United States slash Mexico Totalization Agreement, so call your senator.
[02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:26.333]  And that's already being done with 30 plus countries merging our welfare systems.
[02:39:26.613 --> 02:39:29.995]  Yeah, so this would provide social security benefits to Mexicans.
[02:39:30.015 --> 02:39:31.617]  Well, they already passed that last year.
[02:39:31.697 --> 02:39:32.677]  This is a funding bill.
[02:39:33.258 --> 02:39:37.060]  Well, the Senate, this is an agreement, but the Senate... Oh, a new agreement.
[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:38.821]  Okay, give me the bill number.
[02:39:38.902 --> 02:39:41.483]  Yeah, the Senate hasn't treated it yet, of course.
[02:39:41.563 --> 02:39:42.444]  I don't have the bill number.
[02:39:43.044 --> 02:39:47.948]  But the next one I don't have a bill for either is the Fetal Pain Awareness Act of 2005.
[02:39:48.108 --> 02:39:53.992]  We want that to pass where they've got to tell women that this is really a baby and they feel pain.
[02:39:54.739 --> 02:40:00.224]  Yeah, and okay, then we have... Listen, I've got to get to some news here, Roger.
[02:40:00.244 --> 02:40:01.485]  This is all real important.
[02:40:01.565 --> 02:40:03.606]  I want to put this last one out and then a phone number.
[02:40:04.147 --> 02:40:06.909]  Last one is H.R.
[02:40:06.929 --> 02:40:11.693]  3313 to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts on ruling on marriage.
[02:40:12.033 --> 02:40:13.875]  That's supported by Phyllis Schlafly.
[02:40:13.895 --> 02:40:15.596]  That's H.R.
[02:40:15.616 --> 02:40:16.938]  3313 to pass that.
[02:40:17.318 --> 02:40:19.640]  Lastly, a phone number for the Capitol Hill switchboard.
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:20.821]  And there's only one.
[02:40:20.861 --> 02:40:23.903]  That Tex Lasso one's dead anymore.
[02:40:23.923 --> 02:40:29.028]  So this one is 877-762-8762.
[02:40:29.108 --> 02:40:30.509]  Last repeat.
[02:40:30.529 --> 02:40:31.190]  877-762-8762.
[02:40:31.330 --> 02:40:35.693]  And God bless Alex.
[02:40:35.794 --> 02:40:36.674]  All right.
[02:40:36.694 --> 02:40:37.235]  Take care.
[02:40:37.455 --> 02:40:40.277]  Yeah, I was aware of when he gave out six or seven bills.
[02:40:40.337 --> 02:40:45.121]  I was aware of four of them, and he was giving you an accurate representation of those.
[02:40:45.222 --> 02:40:46.763]  Sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[02:40:47.737 --> 02:40:50.679]  Just amazing the type of things that are going on and happening.
[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:55.082]  But it's about getting us all in their system.
[02:40:55.663 --> 02:41:01.087]  Here's some good news, and on InfoWars.com we have the actual bill posted.
[02:41:03.128 --> 02:41:05.210]  And it's very, very important.
[02:41:05.290 --> 02:41:08.692]  New Hampshire introduces resolution to get U.S.
[02:41:08.772 --> 02:41:09.012]  out of U.N.,
[02:41:10.808 --> 02:41:20.454]  The state of New Hampshire continues to introduce what some would call unusual resolutions, but considered constitutional and vital in protecting America's sovereignty by supporters.
[02:41:20.494 --> 02:41:23.696]  This new bill is there in the legislature states.
[02:41:26.117 --> 02:41:32.881]  And it goes on, a resolution urging Congress to withdraw the United States from the United Nations.
[02:41:33.341 --> 02:41:36.303]  The resolution urges Congress to withdraw the United States from the United Nations.
[02:41:37.003 --> 02:41:39.264]  The state of New Hampshire in the year of our Lord, 2010,
[02:41:40.965 --> 02:41:45.889]  And five, a resolution urging Congress to withdraw the United States from the United Nations.
[02:41:46.950 --> 02:42:01.542]  And it goes into how it's a traitorous organization, and it goes into how clauses and treaties within the UN code actually supersede the Constitution and set up a police state, which they do.
[02:42:02.103 --> 02:42:03.404]  We've covered this many times.
[02:42:03.984 --> 02:42:09.609]  The UN talks about all these great rights, but then later says you actually don't have any rights, and our government has signed on to this.
[02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:16.216]  And it's very, very exciting, and so I suggest you go to InfoWars.com.
[02:42:16.256 --> 02:42:19.159]  I mean, even if you don't have a computer, it's worth it to go get this.
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:23.805]  And why this is important, go to the library and give it to your statehouse.
[02:42:24.706 --> 02:42:25.407]  Because the U.N.
[02:42:25.467 --> 02:42:26.929]  is wildly unpopular.
[02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.771]  And it should be.
[02:42:29.412 --> 02:42:31.174]  And it's a very un-American organization.
[02:42:32.344 --> 02:42:32.805]  We're good to go.
[02:42:32.825 --> 02:42:33.105]  I think?
[02:42:51.875 --> 02:42:52.796]  35 U.S.N.
[02:42:53.337 --> 02:42:53.858]  1957, the U.N.
[02:42:54.018 --> 02:42:54.720]  is insolvent.
[02:42:55.060 --> 02:43:02.633]  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali admitted in the New York Times interview, repented in the Columbus Dispatch way back in 93.
[02:43:04.788 --> 02:43:10.894]  Number three, Oklahoma is a perfect state to seek to recover the $1.2 billion recently paid by the U.S.
[02:43:11.015 --> 02:43:19.763]  on the UNC-attached draft, a proposed Oklahoma lawsuit, and then that's an Oklahoma example of how they're doing this.
[02:43:20.404 --> 02:43:28.272]  And Oklahoma tried to do this right before the Oklahoma City bombing and successfully passed it, but then never implemented it.
[02:43:29.528 --> 02:43:33.692]  We've got New Hampshire, we've got Oklahoma, we've got a lot of this activity going on.
[02:43:34.272 --> 02:43:46.302]  And right before 9-11, I have the selectmen, members of the legislature on from New Hampshire, Ohio, by the way, other articles seeking to do it now.
[02:43:47.163 --> 02:43:51.306]  That's a new bill, not just the one back in 1995 in Oklahoma.
[02:43:51.346 --> 02:43:58.152]  This one here in the New Hampshire Gazette, and as well as the Associated Press, was introduced February 1st.
[02:43:59.269 --> 02:44:14.982]  But right before 9-11, they had almost all the cities and counties ready to pull out under their Article 10 right to revolt clause in the New Hampshire Constitution out of the union, quote, because of the New World Order and the police state.
[02:44:16.683 --> 02:44:26.751]  And then, of course, about four years ago, I saw a World Net Daily article where a state rep in Arizona was trying to get a pull out of the union.
[02:44:28.306 --> 02:44:29.827]  And I called her up and said, why are you doing this?
[02:44:29.847 --> 02:44:32.509]  She said, oh, Alex Jones, I saw your video, Police State 2000.
[02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:34.751]  And she almost got it passed.
[02:44:34.791 --> 02:44:40.255]  Got it passed out of committee, but not out of the full legislature.
[02:44:40.796 --> 02:44:43.518]  Because the session closed when it was on the verge of passing.
[02:44:43.718 --> 02:44:45.579]  They ran out of time, which they usually do.
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:47.061]  Here's my point.
[02:44:48.542 --> 02:44:51.344]  I'm not against the union, per se.
[02:44:52.435 --> 02:45:17.255]  But when the District of Columbia, a private corporation, is dismantling America, butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution, laying waste to our most basic liberties and freedoms that are God-given, not granted by the state, just enumerated and pointed out in the Bill of Rights, and then Article 10 says not fully enumerated, all other rights are also inherent there under God.
[02:45:18.929 --> 02:45:20.691]  I am for states pulling out of the union.
[02:45:20.711 --> 02:45:22.573]  I am for throwing the federal bureaucrats out.
[02:45:23.214 --> 02:45:30.021]  I am for them reconstituting the true United States of America, which the Declaration of Independence orders us to do.
[02:45:30.361 --> 02:45:31.903]  It doesn't authorize us.
[02:45:32.043 --> 02:45:32.964]  It orders us.
[02:45:33.404 --> 02:45:39.290]  And for bureaucrats and police listening that don't get this, government is not God.
[02:45:39.570 --> 02:45:40.752]  You are not the boss.
[02:45:43.140 --> 02:45:51.703]  93% of Austinites, 98% of Houstonites, Houstonians I should say, are against your statewide toll roads.
[02:45:52.243 --> 02:45:55.004]  You laugh at us and say we're doing it, we don't care what you say.
[02:45:56.664 --> 02:46:04.946]  Now your own documents have gone public, you've got plenty of money, that you're planning to privatize it, part of looting, to then let private companies charge and make the money themselves.
[02:46:05.366 --> 02:46:06.007]  You're criminals.
[02:46:07.027 --> 02:46:11.248]  Now I think we should elect Ron Paul as governor and have him move to pull us out of the union.
[02:46:11.937 --> 02:46:13.618]  And then get together with these other states.
[02:46:13.698 --> 02:46:15.159]  I mean, we could do this, folks.
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:18.642]  Four states and 400 cities have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[02:46:19.182 --> 02:46:28.408]  That's why they're racing to put in the electronic voting machines, because they know we're going to try to do this so they can federalize those suckers, which they already did under the $5 billion Voter Assistance Act.
[02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:37.915]  And then they're able to just, it doesn't matter, even the polls were all against it, and we all line up and the exit poll shows we're all voting against something.
[02:46:38.095 --> 02:46:41.117]  They just laugh and go, well, the machine says you voted for the New World Order.
[02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:45.312]  We've got a window of opportunity here, and I can't do it all.
[02:46:45.372 --> 02:46:46.412]  It's up to you to do this.
[02:46:46.993 --> 02:46:47.633]  I'm serious.
[02:46:47.713 --> 02:46:48.273]  Think big.
[02:46:48.313 --> 02:46:49.034]  We can do this.
[02:46:49.714 --> 02:46:50.875]  New Hampshire almost did it.
[02:46:50.895 --> 02:46:52.456]  They were going to pass it the week of 9-11.
[02:46:52.736 --> 02:46:54.937]  And then, boy, they showed up real quick.
[02:46:55.757 --> 02:46:58.239]  Just like Oklahoma passed the law to start doing this.
[02:47:00.060 --> 02:47:04.742]  Right when, just weeks before, actually two months before, the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:47:04.762 --> 02:47:06.203]  That got them back on track, didn't it?
[02:47:07.862 --> 02:47:08.903]  We can do this, though.
[02:47:08.923 --> 02:47:15.608]  We've got to expose the terror star, the New World Order, so when they carry out further terror attacks, people know who's behind it, who has the motives.
[02:47:16.028 --> 02:47:25.596]  We've got to have the states pull out of the Union, because it's defunct, it's a fraud, and I don't care if it's five states or ten, we will reconstitute the true United States.
[02:47:27.157 --> 02:47:30.019]  It's just that simple, and it's constitutional.
[02:47:30.968 --> 02:47:35.869]  And because this sounds so alien to so many people listening, that shows how brainwashed you are.
[02:47:36.209 --> 02:47:39.110]  How far away from what this country was meant to be, we've gotten.
[02:47:41.130 --> 02:47:43.311]  And better do it now than later, folks.
[02:47:43.431 --> 02:47:52.212]  Because, again, they're going to have 35% of the country now has the electronic voting machines openly run by the government, by the CIA, three of the big five companies.
[02:47:52.572 --> 02:47:54.193]  They've been caught in fraud coast to coast.
[02:47:54.613 --> 02:47:55.873]  We've got to do this now.
[02:47:55.933 --> 02:47:58.274]  We've got to stop those electronic machines from going in.
[02:47:58.294 --> 02:47:59.834]  And we've got to pull out...
[02:48:00.314 --> 02:48:02.475]  We've got to have the states pull out of the union now.
[02:48:02.976 --> 02:48:04.036]  You want a solution?
[02:48:04.056 --> 02:48:04.917]  This is it.
[02:48:05.377 --> 02:48:06.357]  And let me tell you something.
[02:48:06.818 --> 02:48:08.779]  It can be done if you start the buzz.
[02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:12.080]  If you come up with the particulars and the ideas, I guess I could do it.
[02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:12.781]  I have to do everything.
[02:48:13.201 --> 02:48:17.443]  I came up with a plan to get the states and cities and counties to pull out of the Patriot Act.
[02:48:17.543 --> 02:48:18.384]  Wrote up the idea.
[02:48:18.444 --> 02:48:19.484]  Others picked it up and did it.
[02:48:20.505 --> 02:48:21.746]  We can do a lot more here.
[02:48:21.766 --> 02:48:23.707]  A lot of you are smarter than I am.
[02:48:24.387 --> 02:48:25.588]  I can give you ideas.
[02:48:25.608 --> 02:48:29.570]  I'm not the first to think this up, but it's up to you to take action with it.
[02:48:30.456 --> 02:48:37.187]  I'll hit some final news articles in a news blitz on the other side of this quick break on this Monday edition.
[02:48:37.247 --> 02:48:38.268]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:38.328 --> 02:48:42.635]  Be sure and check out prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[02:48:46.579 --> 02:48:53.442]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.722 --> 02:48:55.122]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:55.302 --> 02:48:57.523]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.663 --> 02:48:59.744]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:49:00.024 --> 02:49:04.966]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:05.286 --> 02:49:09.328]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:09.588 --> 02:49:11.350]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:22.082]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.243 --> 02:49:24.105]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:49:53.495 --> 02:50:04.399]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.659 --> 02:50:05.080]  We're good to go.
[02:50:21.161 --> 02:50:21.662]  That's right.
[02:50:21.822 --> 02:50:28.949]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[02:51:52.006 --> 02:51:55.847]  Folks, there's no end to the abuse the globalists are going to put upon us.
[02:51:56.207 --> 02:52:00.208]  The limits of tyranny we'll live under are the limits that we'll put up with.
[02:52:01.708 --> 02:52:04.949]  They're putting in a high-tech control grid, a prison grid around us.
[02:52:06.229 --> 02:52:09.090]  And things are just going to get worse until we finally turn things around.
[02:52:09.130 --> 02:52:10.170]  That's the history of the world.
[02:52:11.290 --> 02:52:15.211]  We've got to think big and accept the realities of what we've got to do.
[02:52:15.231 --> 02:52:18.472]  I mean, look at this article here in front of me.
[02:52:19.790 --> 02:52:20.611]  It's just amazing.
[02:52:21.131 --> 02:52:22.011]  Associated Press.
[02:52:22.072 --> 02:52:24.213]  Bulletproof cameras ready to patrol New Orleans.
[02:52:24.693 --> 02:52:26.114]  Homeland Security Grant.
[02:52:26.774 --> 02:52:28.436]  Hundreds of cameras that are bulletproof.
[02:52:28.936 --> 02:52:29.456]  What for?
[02:52:30.477 --> 02:52:32.358]  Because it's a war zone type system.
[02:52:32.398 --> 02:52:33.359]  It's a control grid.
[02:52:33.899 --> 02:52:34.900]  Wired into FEMA.
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:37.041]  Another article here.
[02:52:37.081 --> 02:52:40.163]  Some good news of the American Homeowners Resource Association.
[02:52:41.944 --> 02:52:48.108]  Taxpayers cannot be compelled by the IRS to turn over personal and private property to the IRS absent a federal court order.
[02:52:48.959 --> 02:52:50.421]  Well, what about a jury of your peers?
[02:52:51.001 --> 02:52:53.364]  Before they just take your house, no order, no nothing.
[02:52:53.424 --> 02:52:54.265]  Take your bank account.
[02:52:54.806 --> 02:52:56.347]  Again, how's that a free society?
[02:52:56.588 --> 02:52:57.829]  How's that due process?
[02:52:58.830 --> 02:53:00.672]  The question is, why are federal courts doing this?
[02:53:00.692 --> 02:53:04.116]  Because they're getting ready to get rid of the IRS and give you a national sales tax.
[02:53:05.638 --> 02:53:09.923]  IBM, Sony, Toshiba to reveal super brain ship.
[02:53:11.232 --> 02:53:12.033]  It's not what you think.
[02:53:12.053 --> 02:53:27.283]  The superconductor designers from International Business Machines, Nazi architects, Sony and Toshiba, will reveal today the inner workings of a supercomputer on a chip they claim could revolutionize communications, multimedia, and consumer electronics.
[02:53:27.863 --> 02:53:35.889]  The cell microprocessor has been under development by the three companies since 2001 in a laboratory in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:47.080]  Advanced reports suggest the chip is significantly more powerful and versatile than the next generation of microprocessors announced by the consortium's competitors, Intel and AMD.
[02:53:49.342 --> 02:53:51.004]  It's very serious.
[02:53:51.024 --> 02:53:52.445]  You need to go read that.
[02:53:53.687 --> 02:53:58.892]  Also, hundreds of Iraqis protest alleged voting irregularities.
[02:54:00.231 --> 02:54:09.678]  Hundreds of Iraqis have gathered outside Baghdad's heavily guarded green zone to protest alleged voting irregularities in Mosul that they say prevented tens of thousands from casting ballots.
[02:54:11.119 --> 02:54:17.264]  And they're saying that hundreds of polling places were closed and shuttered, men with masks on would push them away and say they couldn't vote.
[02:54:17.744 --> 02:54:18.805]  Sounds like America.
[02:54:18.825 --> 02:54:19.606]  What's wrong?
[02:54:19.626 --> 02:54:20.406]  You've got new freedom.
[02:54:21.607 --> 02:54:23.709]  And Iraq clashes intensify.
[02:54:23.849 --> 02:54:25.490]  At least 13 people were reported dead.
[02:54:25.911 --> 02:54:28.753]  As Iraqi security forces, it shows pictures of the men in the nice masks,
[02:54:29.571 --> 02:54:32.752]  Clash with fighters opposed to the presence of foreign troops in Iraq.
[02:54:33.292 --> 02:54:34.012]  What's wrong with them?
[02:54:34.052 --> 02:54:35.453]  That's freedom having foreign troops.
[02:54:38.033 --> 02:54:41.614]  Continuing here with more of this news.
[02:54:41.674 --> 02:54:45.255]  Critics question NASA on safety of the shuttles.
[02:54:46.155 --> 02:54:49.616]  NASA prepares a return to space shuttle to orbit this spring.
[02:54:49.936 --> 02:54:55.958]  A debate over whether the fleet is as safe as it should be has been building inside and outside the space agency.
[02:54:56.627 --> 02:55:05.180]  Well, yeah, after they proved a few years ago with the Columbia that they knew it had problems and told their scientists to shut up.
[02:55:06.602 --> 02:55:07.764]  Just amazing.
[02:55:09.321 --> 02:55:10.342]  Folks, I'm out of time.
[02:55:10.422 --> 02:55:12.803]  I'm sorry I don't have time to take any more of your calls.

[02:55:30.955 --> 02:55:35.618]  And also on the Internet at Infowars.com or Prison.com.
[02:55:37.777 --> 02:55:43.362]  A few other articles real quick here in the last 50 seconds.
[02:55:43.642 --> 02:55:45.284]  This is out of the Star News.
[02:55:46.585 --> 02:55:47.986]  Reposting the New York Times.
[02:55:48.146 --> 02:55:52.670]  City laid plans to deliver medical assistance to public after the attack.
[02:55:53.591 --> 02:56:03.279]  And it's really just another manifestation of the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act martial law mass roundup forced inoculation.
[02:56:04.637 --> 02:56:12.423]  Which they're gearing back up for despite the fact that 99% of police and firemen and medical workers refused to take the shots two years ago.
[02:56:14.024 --> 02:56:16.426]  Alright, we are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:16.506 --> 02:56:29.717]  As I said, it's an honor to be your host to engage in real talk radio, real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family Monday through Friday right here on the GCN Radio Network.
