[00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:06.458]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:08.199]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.020]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.501]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:13.102]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.606]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:22.049]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:27.810]  Well, she was the commanding general over all the prisons and detention centers.
[00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.611]  I bet she's got some stories to tell.
[00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:33.054]  In Iraq, and she was General Janice Berpinski.
[00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:35.135]  She's joining us in about five minutes.
[00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:39.739]  The only female general officer commanding troops in the combat zone in Iraq.
[00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:41.720]  And they try to scapegoat her.
[00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.081]  That's coming up.
[00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.122]  Also, your calls.
[00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:45.783]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.766]  Scott Ritter, the UN weapons inspector, with a bunch of new revelations and developments.
[00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.437]  Another big whistleblower joining us in the next hour.
[00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:56.459]  Let's go to Joel in Wisconsin right now.
[00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.220]  Joel, welcome.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.181]  Hi Alex.
[00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:03.464]  I wanted to go over a few things like the Fed Chair being changed.
[00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:07.847]  I know Alan Greenspan said that the gold-backed dollar is the best thing.
[00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:09.248]  Then when he gets in,
[00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.403]  All of a sudden, oh no, no, no.
[00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:17.165]  He wrote books that sounded like they were written by Eustace Mullins.
[00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:17.785]  Oh yeah.
[00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.446]  I mean, these are published in Ayn Rand publications in the 60s.
[00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.968]  But by the 70s, he switched over to their side.
[00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.389]  They actually paid him off and hired him.
[00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:26.649]  Oh yeah.
[00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.410]  I mean, he was one of us, folks.
[00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.391]  He talked just like us.
[00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:30.731]  I'm going to make a prediction.
[00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:38.395]  I'm going to predict that interest rates are going to rise through the roof, that this new chairman is going to burst the housing bubble for sure.
[00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:49.135]  And what they're doing is they're using the hurricane and did you know just in the past half day or so there's been a bombing that went off in Baghdad again.
[00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:55.881]  But the terrorists are blowing up reporters.
[00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:58.984]  Now I couldn't think of any terrorists
[00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:03.333]  In the right or wrong mind, that would do something that stupid.
[00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:06.214]  Yeah, why do the terrorists always do what helps the globalists?
[00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:09.555]  Like, Saddam says, I hate Al-Qaeda, I'm fighting them, which is true.
[00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:13.917]  And then all of a sudden, Bin Laden pops up and goes, no, no, I'm working with him.
[00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:20.320]  And then, of course, Colin Powell knows hours before the tape's released, because he works for them.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.541]  It's totally and completely slick luck.
[00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:26.142]  Well, why would they want bad press releases?
[00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:27.063]  I mean, what...
[00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:28.624]  I'm looking at it this way.
[00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:39.171]  The government, if some reporter got a hold of some really hot news that was, like, meltdown great, I would think that the government would want them hushed up really quick.
[00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:44.054]  But I don't think terrorists would... Well, sir, it's not just your logic that's correct.
[00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:45.355]  It's the facts.
[00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:54.581]  You notice the Spanish judge has indicted and is calling for the arrest of the troops that fired with the Abrams into the hotel?
[00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.326]  No one was firing at them from the hotel.
[00:02:57.706 --> 00:03:00.647]  The 9th floor was doing bad reports on them killing kids.
[00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:02.507]  They just had arguments with them.
[00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:04.408]  They were ordered to assassinate them.
[00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.789]  The Pentagon said they were going to kill reporters beforehand.
[00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.990]  And I hear neocons on the radio going, our troops just can't do anything right.
[00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.811]  They just can't defend themselves.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.661]  They openly are targeting reporters.
[00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:18.681]  It's like in the Associated Press.
[00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:23.643]  They had major reporters, a big gaggle of them, had an officer walk over to them.
[00:03:23.663 --> 00:03:24.743]  Remember this a few weeks ago?
[00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.244]  In New Orleans.
[00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:32.265]  And he said, I don't care if the federal court says you're allowed to take photos and be here.
[00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:37.547]  You release one photo of any of this, we are going to kill you like we do people in Iraq.
[00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:39.607]  Now that's in front of reporters!
[00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:44.068]  That's not us claiming they kill reporters, that's them saying, we kill you!
[00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.509]  We will kill you!
[00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.090]  In America, troops saying, an officer, right in front of a whole group of reporters, knowing it, get out!
[00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.370]  We will kill you!
[00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:01.993]  I think they're using Harris as a lightning rod, because I don't think she's electable, but I do think that the next person they put in is going to be even worse, but it's going to be the other side.
[00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:03.033]  So...
[00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:07.759]  Would it be okay if I listen off air to the interview?
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.822]  Sir, we can't let people sit on the phone line.
[00:04:09.942 --> 00:04:11.224]  I do appreciate your call.
[00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:13.687]  I mean, I really, really do appreciate your call, sir.
[00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:19.253]  You can listen on shortwave, on internet, if you don't have a local AM or FM affiliate, up in Wisconsin.
[00:04:19.654 --> 00:04:23.799]  I suggest, for all of you who don't have an AM or FM affiliate, or listen on shortwave on the internet,
[00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:29.456]  Uh, on bad shortwave days or bad internet days, whatever, to call and get us a local affiliate in your area.
[00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:32.978]  That's how we get most of our stations, and we're getting more of them.
[00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:34.739]  I want to thank all those stations.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.742]  Uh, is that people just keep calling and calling and calling.
[00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:39.783]  We want Alex Jones.
[00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:41.124]  We want Alex Jones.
[00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:42.725]  We want Alex Jones.
[00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:46.167]  And, uh, they've got the receivers to pick us up.
[00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:47.928]  We're on the big digital birds, folks.
[00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:52.832]  And, uh, pretty much everybody in radio now knows who I am, so it's not that hard of a sell.
[00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:57.197]  We're getting pretty mainstream in that everything we've talked about is coming out.
[00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:05.658]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:07.499]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.500]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.581]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.882]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.945]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:29.688]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.888 --> 00:05:34.291]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:41.756]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:44.438]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:03.729]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.953]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:10.975]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:17.761]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:20.963]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:23.545]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.685 --> 00:06:31.572]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:06:31.872 --> 00:06:43.134]  Methazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:43.294 --> 00:06:51.055]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:05.043]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:05.304 --> 00:07:05.624]  Why?
[00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:08.586]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:08.699]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.342]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:16.786]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[00:08:16.866 --> 00:08:19.108]  We wage war on corruption.
[00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:27.375]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, Central Standard Time, blasting out across the country on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on the internet.
[00:08:28.076 --> 00:08:28.837]  Thank you so much.
[00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:31.165]  Thank you for tuning in today.
[00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:34.949]  We've got Scott Ritter coming on in the next hour.
[00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.754]  Just a lot of new revelations and he's spilt his guts in this new book.
[00:08:40.894 --> 00:08:44.538]  Stuff that you've never seen in the press, you've never heard before.
[00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:48.382]  Everything so well documented that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:49.302 --> 00:08:52.966]  And everything he has told us, he's been completely vindicated.
[00:08:54.324 --> 00:09:02.873]  Just totally vindicated, and he has been through the wringer at the hands of the frothing, treasonous neo-concs.
[00:09:03.874 --> 00:09:17.448]  But for the next 51 minutes, and we're even going to take some calls a little bit later, we are joined by the Brigadier General, retired now, and she was the head of all the prisons and detainment
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:43.065]  Facilities, 17 of them, at the time, in Iraq, 3400 soldiers, and she's Janice Karpinski, and when she started refusing to be scapegoated, and started pointing out the military intelligence, and the 205 military intelligence brigade was in control of every wing, in every prison where this stuff was going on, where the torture was going on,
[00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:59.595]  When she wouldn't fall on her sword and commit Harry Caray when she hadn't done anything, Lord Bush, the silver spoon creature, fell on, basically forced her to, well, be broken down to a kernel.
[00:10:00.609 --> 00:10:02.410]  And it just makes me so angry.
[00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:09.956]  And she's written a new book, and we're going to tell you about it, One Woman's Army, and it's in most finer bookstores now.
[00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:16.040]  We'll tell you how to get it online at Amazon.com and more about the book as she now joins us.
[00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:20.503]  And General, it's really good to have you on with us today.
[00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:22.325]  And it is great to be with you.
[00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:23.025]  It's a privilege.
[00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:23.886]  Thank you very much.
[00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:28.080]  For those that don't know, I mean, we have General Togumbo's own report.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:53.285]  I mean, it's admitted raping, pouring acid on people, the photos we've seen of the tip of the iceberg, but then, day one, I knew that even at Camp X-Ray, Brigadier General Rick Baucus refused to torture, so he got kicked out, as well, so you're among a lot of other company, and now that's finally broken on, not on the major TV shows like Frontline, but we reported on it two years ago,
[00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.230]  I mean, this is going on.
[00:10:56.271 --> 00:11:12.699]  For those that don't know, the torture is admitted, but we know that even in Guantanamo Bay, there is a CIA base within the base, that's where the torture goes on, and can you break this down and basically go through what happened and how they tried to scapegoat you?
[00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:23.324]  Well, I guess we'll never know until they're willing to admit, and they never will, but we can speculate as to why they wanted to scapegoat me, and there's every reason to believe
[00:11:24.146 --> 00:11:26.368]  That those reasons are valid.
[00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:31.793]  But it started when we were assigned this new mission for detention operations.
[00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:34.295]  We were basically sold a false bill of goods.
[00:11:34.335 --> 00:11:41.982]  They told us that we were going to Baghdad, that we were going to receive support from the CJTF-7, General Sanchez's headquarters.
[00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:56.063]  And from Ambassador Bremmer at the Coalition Provisional Authority that we would be working with these prisons experts at the Coalition Provisional Authority to work towards restoring Iraqi jails and prisons to turn it back over to the Iraqi control.
[00:11:57.324 --> 00:12:02.587]  To arrive in Baghdad to discover that they had just begun to identify some locations.
[00:12:02.647 --> 00:12:06.709]  They had a list of 121 prisons that they wanted to restore and that they wanted us to run.
[00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:12.700]  And I told them I didn't have nearly that number of resources.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.540]  I could run about 15.
[00:12:14.281 --> 00:12:16.863]  We settled on 17.
[00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:23.507]  And they were responsible for providing the funding to restore those prisons and renovate those prisons.
[00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:34.214]  That was very slow in coming, only to discover after those contractors left that most of the contract work that had been allegedly done and paid for was in fact never done.
[00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:42.034]  So we had MPs that were running these facilities in very, very austere conditions.
[00:12:42.755 --> 00:12:47.538]  The prisons that were restored were done to the minimal standards.
[00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:59.387]  In one case, the contractors put the hinges on the insides of the prison doors so the prisoners took all the hinge pins out and were waiting outside in the courtyard and scared the Iraqi guards away and the MPs had to go back in.
[00:13:00.294 --> 00:13:28.808]  uh... regain control of the prison facility but Abu Ghraib was never intended to be a permanent prison detention or prison or detention operation it was used as an interim facility largely because there was real estate available inside the twenty foot high retaining wall uh... which was the first line of defense uh... for us to establish temporary camps prisoner of war camps if there was still a war going on
[00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:32.631]  This would have been much like a prisoner of war camp.
[00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:41.475]  It was never an ideal location of any kind for detention operations, let alone interrogation operations, as it ultimately became.
[00:13:41.935 --> 00:13:52.700]  General, we're talking to Brigadier General Janice Karpinski, now retired, and Lord Bush bossed her down to colonel when she started going public about a year ago, refusing to go along with this fraud.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.101]  I mean, specifically, let's get into the separation of duties.
[00:13:56.522 --> 00:13:57.102]  Once you guys
[00:13:57.942 --> 00:14:09.754]  Are in there, you're overloaded, 3400 troops, that's with security, a lot of your prisons and facilities are under daily bombardment by rockets, grenades, snipers, bombings.
[00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:24.485]  And on top of this, I didn't specifically, because obviously you were there in commanding this, how the military intelligence took over and cloistered and kind of sequestered their own little reservations within your reservations.
[00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:35.873]  The military intelligence brigade commander relocated to Abu Ghraib after one of his soldiers, two of his soldiers were killed in a RPG attack out at the prison facility.
[00:14:36.313 --> 00:14:40.056]  He was visiting one night, only intended to spend one or two nights out there.
[00:14:40.812 --> 00:14:58.358]  There was an attack and two of his soldiers were killed and shortly after that he made the decision to relocate to Abu Ghraib and he had about six interrogation teams which then became about a dozen interrogation teams and these were military interrogators.
[00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:01.380]  These were soldiers who were serving as interrogators.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.201]  They were following their regulations, their doctrine.
[00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:07.042]  We had a very low number, a very small number of
[00:15:08.844 --> 00:15:15.363]  uh... prisoners that needed to be interrogated they were mostly iraqi criminals nonviolent crime looting
[00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:19.574]  Missing curfew, a weapon in the trunk of a car, whatever it may have been.
[00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:22.196]  Well, that's what the Army's other report said.
[00:15:22.236 --> 00:15:28.301]  It said that between 75 and 90 percent were totally innocent and just hadn't had their papers in order.
[00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:29.102]  That's correct.
[00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:32.485]  And it remains so, I believe, it remains so today.
[00:15:33.005 --> 00:15:41.632]  Because they're still doing these raids, these roundups, where they'll go out and target an individual and whoever happens to be around that individual, they bring them all in.
[00:15:41.933 --> 00:15:44.555]  And then there's no way, there's no avenue to release them
[00:15:45.183 --> 00:15:52.467]  Once they're tagged as security detainees, they fall into this relatively new and unsupervised category.
[00:15:53.107 --> 00:16:06.674]  And when you had this departure from detention operations and following the rules to control of detention operations by a military intelligence commander, you have a complete departure from
[00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:13.350]  Anything other than chaos, as far as who's in charge, who can give me orders, who can instruct me.
[00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.672]  What was it like having somebody under you, though?
[00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:19.515]  I mean, I've heard the stories of Delta Force commanding generals around.
[00:16:19.535 --> 00:16:22.998]  What was it like having somebody under you, basically telling you what to do?
[00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.500]  Well, Colonel Pappas never worked for me.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.822]  He was never in my chain of command.
[00:16:27.922 --> 00:16:29.523]  So he just basically did whatever he wanted?
[00:16:29.703 --> 00:16:30.204]  Absolutely.
[00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:32.866]  When it came to interrogations, he answered to General Fast.
[00:16:33.386 --> 00:16:37.849]  Who was the intelligence officer at the headquarters and to General Sanchez, who was the commander.
[00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.552]  He didn't report any of his interrogation findings through me.
[00:16:41.652 --> 00:16:59.584]  In fact, the one time that one of his captains, when we had this first raid that was conducted and they brought in about 37 security detainees, within about 36 hours they had interviewed all of them and said that the majority of them were available for release.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:08.983]  When I briefed that, that evening at the nightly update, I was told by General Wojcikowski, the Deputy Commander, not to release anybody.
[00:17:09.423 --> 00:17:12.124]  And who gave me those instructions?
[00:17:12.244 --> 00:17:14.345]  And I said, they weren't instructions, it was a list.
[00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:18.526]  The interrogator said they were eligible to be released and were ready to release them.
[00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.127]  And there is no further intel value.
[00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:23.108]  He said, you are not to release anybody.
[00:17:23.775 --> 00:17:30.756]  And then he got the captain and read him the riot act about not releasing anybody and there started the pattern of holding.
[00:17:31.724 --> 00:17:34.546]  Largely innocent people.
[00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:38.007]  General, we've got you for the rest of this hour, and my mind is just spinning.
[00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:39.708]  I mean, there's so much I want to talk about.
[00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:47.652]  I want to talk about what happened in there, how they kept you guys out of it, then how they tried to blame you with it, when their own documents show you weren't even allowed in there.
[00:17:48.593 --> 00:17:58.338]  All of this going on, and then we've got Alberto Gonzalez writing memos that then the Pentagon uses, giving orders to their own little subgroups under black ops,
[00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:04.990]  And then they send people to prison for following orders, even in their own groups.
[00:18:05.571 --> 00:18:08.476]  I mean it's just, there's so many facets to this.
[00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:10.059]  And they're all bad.
[00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:13.033]  Yes.
[00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:30.708]  We can trace now, we can trace back to, through documents that were released under court order, we can trace back to the original document, the one that Alberto Gonzalez reviewed and discussed with the President of the United States, a departure from the Geneva Convention.
[00:18:30.748 --> 00:18:33.471]  These are not prisoners, these are terrorists.
[00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:35.733]  And these techniques will be more effective.
[00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:44.692]  And then Secretary Rumsfeld putting his signature on a document authorizing more aggressive techniques, harsher techniques during interrogation.
[00:18:45.272 --> 00:18:58.606]  That document goes down to Guantanamo Bay and over to Afghanistan and it's used perhaps first in small groups and then it's used at Guantanamo Bay as a standard practice.
[00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:06.249]  Well, specifically, General, we've got a break, but what about private contractors inside Abu Ghraib and other areas?
[00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:09.130]  Because we've seen the reports that they were in there, too.
[00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:09.991]  Absolutely.
[00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:17.275]  And when you ask private contractors to do anything related to combat operations, you're already heading down a very dangerous path.
[00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:22.130]  We're talking about mercenaries, but now mercenary interrogators?
[00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.972]  I mean, I remember sitting in an L.A.
[00:19:26.012 --> 00:19:36.236]  hotel room watching Rumsfeld go on, we've taken the gloves off, we're really pressuring him, and in laughter in the military briefing, this was all publicly encouraged!
[00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:40.279]  And then they can send people to prison while they don't get in trouble?
[00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.901]  I just can't figure that out.
[00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:43.282]  General, this is amazing.
[00:19:43.302 --> 00:19:43.842]  We've got a break.
[00:19:43.862 --> 00:19:44.983]  We'll be back in about three minutes.
[00:19:45.864 --> 00:19:47.285]  And then we'll continue.
[00:19:48.626 --> 00:19:55.752]  Just any areas, directions you want to go in, just tell us because this is such a wide field.
[00:19:56.213 --> 00:19:57.093]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.154 --> 00:20:00.396]  We're talking to General Janice Karpinski.
[00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:06.218]  Natokinase is a powerful enzyme that supports healthy blood flow.
[00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:14.224]  The enzyme is isolated from a traditional Japanese food called natto, which has been eaten in Japan for over 2,000 years for cardiovascular health.
[00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:19.709]  Dr. Martin Milner, M.D., Professor of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Medicine says,
[00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:29.457]  In all my years of research as a professor of cardiovascular and pulmonary medicine, natokinase represents the most exciting new development in supporting cardiovascular health.
[00:20:29.477 --> 00:20:35.202]  Dr. Jonathan Wright, MD, says the first patient we asked to try it had a rapid and dramatic response.
[00:20:35.542 --> 00:20:39.365]  Allergy Research Group uses only the gold standard, natokinase.
[00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:48.152]  Which is the only form endorsed by Dr. Sumi, the discoverer of natokinase, and Dr. Ralph Halsworth, the leading natokinase researcher in the US.
[00:20:48.412 --> 00:20:56.658]  Natokinase can be found by visiting allergyresearchgroup.com or nutrimedicals.com or by calling 1-800-545-9960.
[00:21:01.773 --> 00:21:12.500]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:20.286]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:23.648]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:29.652]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:21:29.952 --> 00:21:36.114]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:21:36.475 --> 00:21:40.356]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:42.297]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:42.477 --> 00:21:48.439]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:52.381]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:57.523 --> 00:21:58.343]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:58.383 --> 00:22:00.164]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:22:00.324 --> 00:22:01.044]  One and the same.
[00:22:01.064 --> 00:22:07.885]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.711]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:26.792]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:29.893]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:32.654]  Here is reality.
[00:22:33.034 --> 00:22:36.616]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.096 --> 00:22:40.757]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:43.818]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.501 --> 00:22:49.204]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:23:02.108 --> 00:23:06.751]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:07.532]  have diabetes.
[00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:14.797]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:23:14.937 --> 00:23:19.480]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.502]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:03.891]  Folks, I want you to think about the magnitude of the defections.
[00:24:03.931 --> 00:24:05.993]  Last week we had Ray McGovern, number 5 in the CIA.
[00:24:14.071 --> 00:24:24.253]  Who briefed Ronald Reagan, who briefed George Bush Senior, coming right out on air saying Bush may carry out terror attacks because he's in so much trouble to keep his war going.
[00:24:24.553 --> 00:24:26.273]  That our own government might pull something.
[00:24:26.313 --> 00:24:29.314]  I mean, that's how out in the open all this is getting.
[00:24:29.754 --> 00:24:31.335]  That's how many whistleblowers there are.
[00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:37.636]  Ron Paul, Republican Congressman, saying the government may be preparing for a coup d'etat, for martial law.
[00:24:38.456 --> 00:24:41.697]  I mean, that's how Twilight Zone things have gotten in here.
[00:24:41.737 --> 00:24:43.397]  We are talking to
[00:24:44.412 --> 00:24:48.373]  Brigadier General Janice Karpinski, in her new book, One Woman's Army.
[00:24:48.413 --> 00:24:49.373]  You talk about courage!
[00:24:49.393 --> 00:24:52.714]  You know, at first, they were blaming her, and people said, oh, she's the one.
[00:24:52.754 --> 00:24:53.715]  I got on here, remember?
[00:24:53.755 --> 00:24:58.876]  And I said, folks, these areas are under military intelligence control.
[00:24:58.936 --> 00:25:00.496]  They're CIA interrogators.
[00:25:00.516 --> 00:25:02.377]  It's the same thing at Camp X-Ray.
[00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:03.957]  They have a CIA base within a base.
[00:25:04.337 --> 00:25:05.338]  This is pure bull.
[00:25:05.798 --> 00:25:07.078]  And later, that did come out.
[00:25:07.118 --> 00:25:08.178]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:09.759]  We knew how they were doing this.
[00:25:10.499 --> 00:25:12.660]  General, I mean, let's go right down the line here.
[00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.731]  We have the documents.
[00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:20.133]  We know where these orders to do this torture came from.
[00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:22.335]  Came right from the top.
[00:25:22.775 --> 00:25:31.662]  Filtered all the way down through the Secretary of Defense with the endorsement of the President, the Vice President, you know, whatever advisors are surrounding him.
[00:25:32.263 --> 00:25:35.506]  And filtered down through the commanders in the field.
[00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:43.332]  These practices were not only endorsed but were in use at Guantanamo Bay and in locations in Afghanistan.
[00:25:43.812 --> 00:25:45.474]  And when General Miller visited Iraq
[00:25:45.993 --> 00:25:53.180]  He carried those techniques with him and taught the interrogators on site how to be more effective in their interrogations.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:26:03.450]  And then he sent contract interrogators and people he knew, military people he knew, who had performed well down at Guantanamo Bay, he sent them to Iraq as well.
[00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:07.754]  So really we had kind of torture seminars going on?
[00:26:08.394 --> 00:26:11.217]  Yes, everywhere except in Abu Ghraib.
[00:26:11.978 --> 00:26:24.648]  Because General Miller must have thought that his discussions with the Military Intelligence Brigade Commander were effective enough for him to understand that he could do anything he needed to do to get actionable intelligence from the prisoners.
[00:26:26.428 --> 00:26:39.575]  Now, you know, they talk about how they went after Grainer in England and others because they had photos, but you point out in your book, why then, you know, who took the pictures and why did that happen?
[00:26:40.356 --> 00:26:52.122]  And then on top of it, if Congress has seen over 2,000 photos and over 100 videos of raping women, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about savage Joseph Mingala type stuff, even underage people.
[00:26:52.602 --> 00:26:55.904]  I mean, if this is going on, then why haven't all those people been indicted?
[00:26:56.364 --> 00:27:10.238]  Because they needed a group of people to call the scapegoat, excuse me, they needed to scapegoat people that, and they must have believed naively that they were going to take the punishment, go to jail, and be quiet.
[00:27:10.278 --> 00:27:16.945]  That they would never go out and hire their own attorneys or representatives for themselves in their own cases.
[00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:26.825]  They certainly believed that I was going to be quiet, that I was just going to take what they were accusing me of and go back home to the United States after my deployment.
[00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.046]  Now this was in the press.
[00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:33.587]  The first you heard of it was when the investigation was already going and you'd never even been in that area of the prison.
[00:27:33.807 --> 00:27:34.427]  That's correct.
[00:27:34.627 --> 00:27:38.548]  I didn't hear about this from the people that you would think I should hear it from.
[00:27:38.608 --> 00:27:42.069]  General Sanchez or his intelligence officer, General Fast.
[00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:44.990]  I heard about this in an email late at night
[00:27:45.492 --> 00:27:47.789]  From the Commander of the Criminal Investigation Division.
[00:27:48.576 --> 00:27:56.561]  And his agent on site at Abu Ghraib is the one who actually received the disc of pictures, the initial disc, from the MP.
[00:27:57.302 --> 00:28:00.244]  And he called the commander and they opened an investigation.
[00:28:00.304 --> 00:28:06.328]  So when I got the email that mentioned an ongoing investigation, that was on the 12th of January of 2004.
[00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:10.491]  That was the first I heard of any investigation.
[00:28:10.511 --> 00:28:14.954]  You're the commanding officer of all the prisons and you don't even know about it.
[00:28:15.174 --> 00:28:15.794]  That's correct.
[00:28:15.814 --> 00:28:18.276]  They kept me out of the loop on purpose.
[00:28:19.837 --> 00:28:21.997]  How is the military supposed to operate?
[00:28:22.017 --> 00:28:23.898]  I mean, no military has ever done this.
[00:28:24.158 --> 00:28:30.301]  Hitler was really the first to have the SS separate from the mainline army and it was disastrous.
[00:28:30.801 --> 00:28:32.621]  And this was disastrous as well.
[00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:36.523]  You take a prison location,
[00:28:37.003 --> 00:28:40.564]  That was never a good location for any kind of detention operations.
[00:28:40.624 --> 00:28:42.104]  It was being mortared every night.
[00:28:42.564 --> 00:28:44.405]  It was in the middle of the Sunni triangle.
[00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:50.846]  And now you take this operation and you put it under the control of the military intelligence.
[00:28:50.866 --> 00:28:55.667]  And their objective is completely different than the objective of a military police soldier.
[00:28:56.387 --> 00:29:03.329]  And they know how to treat prisoners humanely and fairly and they did so in every facility where they were running detention operations.
[00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:04.529]  The only
[00:29:05.469 --> 00:29:10.873]  Well, I read about where they would go get prison guards, federal prison guards with bad records, and actually hire them.
[00:29:10.913 --> 00:29:12.313]  They were actually scouting for sickos.
[00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:33.419]  Well, there is a, you know, and not only... The prisons experts that were hired, we were supposed to have about 80 of them down at the Coalition Provisional Authority.
[00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:34.219]  There was three.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.021]  And then one of them got fired.
[00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:36.941]  And these are U.S.
[00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:37.882]  contractors.
[00:29:38.723 --> 00:29:48.209]  Of course, they didn't share the information about their previous positions with us, but after we returned, we found out that... General, we got a break.
[00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:48.950]  Tell us after the break.
[00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:54.883]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.806 --> 00:29:58.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.064 --> 00:30:04.645]  Government is best what governs me.
[00:30:05.206 --> 00:30:06.526]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:06.967 --> 00:30:09.629]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:12.771]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:13.191 --> 00:30:19.675]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:30:43.051 --> 00:30:44.572]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:56.014]  Osama Bin Forgotten?

[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.063]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.323 --> 00:32:08.147]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:08.467 --> 00:32:09.288]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.729 --> 00:32:13.853]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:14.073 --> 00:32:18.257]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.638 --> 00:32:23.503]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:33:02.123 --> 00:33:04.325]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:07.747]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:08.088 --> 00:33:13.912]  We've got the General for about 30 more minutes.
[00:33:14.132 --> 00:33:15.073]  Really honored to have her.
[00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:20.053]  She's the Brigadier General who ran the prisons and camps in Iraq.
[00:33:20.553 --> 00:33:26.555]  General Janice Harpinski, her new book, One Woman's Army, and it's in bookstores everywhere.
[00:33:26.595 --> 00:33:27.215]  You need to get it.
[00:33:27.235 --> 00:33:30.776]  And look, I just got my copy a few days ago that the publisher mailed me.
[00:33:30.817 --> 00:33:31.337]  It's excellent.
[00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:33.417]  I haven't read the whole thing and I've read about three chapters.
[00:33:34.918 --> 00:33:37.499]  But we need to support people that are bold and tell the truth.
[00:33:38.288 --> 00:33:39.870]  And they didn't expect her to go public.
[00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.013]  That's where we had left off when we went to break.
[00:33:43.113 --> 00:33:46.816]  I guess they expect you to be spineless like all the others.
[00:33:47.437 --> 00:33:55.565]  You know, there's an increasing number and it's a great concern to me personally and professionally because I saw senior officers in Iraq who were
[00:33:56.477 --> 00:34:03.304]  More concerned about the political ramifications of their decisions than they were about the leadership or moral decisions, ramifications.
[00:34:03.765 --> 00:34:14.376]  They were hesitant to go against anything that Secretary Rumsfeld was putting out because he had proven, if you don't agree with him,
[00:34:15.183 --> 00:34:16.444]  You'll find yourself on the street.
[00:34:16.544 --> 00:34:18.045]  You'll find yourself without a position.
[00:34:18.885 --> 00:34:24.369]  So there is no backbone anymore that, you know, we've become very famous for in the military.
[00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:28.471]  We have the strongest military in the world, but our leaders are now afraid.
[00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:33.734]  They're afraid to voice their opinions, they're afraid to state their opinions, and they're afraid to say, no, you're wrong.
[00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:44.283]  General, even their Enron crony, their darling, Army Secretary White, who was an insider with these guys, he said, look, the generals say 400,000 troops.
[00:34:44.923 --> 00:34:46.104]  We're going to fail.
[00:34:46.625 --> 00:34:48.526]  It's what all the RAM Corporation says.
[00:34:48.867 --> 00:34:50.388]  And they said, you're out of there, buddy.
[00:34:50.568 --> 00:34:52.750]  And that's what they did to General Shinseki as well.
[00:34:53.522 --> 00:35:00.206]  He went back to Secretary Rumsfeld twice, and he said, we need more than 300,000 soldiers if we're going to do this right.
[00:35:00.566 --> 00:35:05.789]  And the second time he went back to him, he said, well, then I guess you don't understand me, and I don't need you.
[00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:07.089]  And he brought in his own team.
[00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:13.913]  And General Shinseki was, for all practical purposes, a lame duck for months until he retired.
[00:35:15.592 --> 00:35:31.987]  It's amazing though that, I mean, when they get unanimous data from the people that know how to fight wars, and know how to get the power back on and help the civilian population, they just, you know, I'm sure you've seen the Karl Rove quote where he says, we control reality, we make reality.
[00:35:32.027 --> 00:35:33.268]  I mean, they really are delusional.
[00:35:33.348 --> 00:35:34.569]  You want to see reality?
[00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:36.571]  Go to Baghdad, that's reality.
[00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:39.754]  Walk the ground where the soldiers are walking, that's reality.
[00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:45.188]  This nonsense about running, and this is what happened with the CJTF 7 headquarters.
[00:35:45.588 --> 00:35:50.151]  The officers on General Sanchez's staff were trying to run the war from their laptop computers.
[00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:53.873]  They didn't go out and walk the ground that the soldiers were walking.
[00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:56.875]  They didn't see what the soldiers were facing every day.
[00:35:57.276 --> 00:36:00.498]  They were trying to run the war from their laptop computers.
[00:36:00.918 --> 00:36:05.901]  They were afraid to go out in the middle of the hostilities, but they had no problem sending any of us out.
[00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.162]  to do that work.
[00:36:07.522 --> 00:36:18.431]  So we've gone from George Washington at Trenton charging into the German soldiers himself with bullets flicking through his hat to generals cowering in armored compounds.
[00:36:18.951 --> 00:36:20.392]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:36:20.413 --> 00:36:23.735]  You want to know where the armored vehicles were and they weren't out on the road with the soldiers?
[00:36:24.135 --> 00:36:28.159]  They were protecting the spokesperson for General Sanchez.
[00:36:28.499 --> 00:36:30.781]  They were parked on the confines of Camp Victory
[00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:37.553]  So in case any of those officers had to take a 20-minute journey somewhere across the road to the airport, they'd be in an up-armored vehicle.
[00:36:37.573 --> 00:36:40.559]  And soldiers were paying the price for that.
[00:36:42.941 --> 00:36:43.761]  Well, they don't care.
[00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:49.605]  They'll just have a neocon get on the radio and say they've got plenty of armored vehicles when I've got family over there and they still don't.
[00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.006]  What are these letters we're getting back home?
[00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:53.307]  What are these soldiers saying?
[00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:54.587]  Are they all wrong?
[00:36:54.907 --> 00:36:56.248]  Are they all making this up?
[00:36:56.708 --> 00:37:03.972]  When a soldier stands up and says to the Secretary of Defense, why don't we have the right equipment if you want us to do this the right way and survive?
[00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:08.555]  And he says, well, we go to war with the army, we have not necessarily the one that we want.
[00:37:08.935 --> 00:37:10.516]  And it's never addressed again.
[00:37:11.454 --> 00:37:26.649]  The person who stopped, the person who stopped the orders for additional armored equipment and armored vehicles is today a four-star general and is in the Pentagon and is serving as the, he is the acting Chief of Staff of the Army.
[00:37:27.029 --> 00:37:42.608]  Well, the FBI agents that blocked Robert Wright and Kathleen Rowley and others, who specifically had the documents and knew who the hijackers were according to the official story, they all got demoted or removed or fired, but the people that blocked them have all been promoted.
[00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:43.870]  See how it works?
[00:37:44.686 --> 00:37:50.472]  You play the game, you go along with whatever's being spun by the neocons or by the Pentagon, and you get promoted.
[00:37:50.953 --> 00:38:03.105]  But the people who have the strength and the moral courage to stand up and say, this is wrong, this is a lie, they're removed from their positions, they take their security clearances away, and then they're out on the street.
[00:38:04.253 --> 00:38:07.754]  And that's a big message to be sending throughout the force.
[00:38:08.075 --> 00:38:11.976]  You cross the Secretary of Defense and you're out on the street.
[00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:15.097]  But if I was the Secretary of Defense, I would want the real intel.
[00:38:15.437 --> 00:38:17.498]  I would want to know what was really going on.
[00:38:17.818 --> 00:38:23.581]  I would want to know what the trained war fighters were saying instead of this delusional la-la.
[00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:26.101]  I mean, just because I think something doesn't make it so.
[00:38:26.522 --> 00:38:29.763]  Or just because you repeat a lie often enough doesn't make it the truth.
[00:38:30.618 --> 00:38:32.839]  But, you've already started down that road.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:46.128]  If you stop this train, which is what they need to do, realistically, they need to stop this train and say, wait, clean the slate, we need to get to the truth and we need to get there now.
[00:38:46.468 --> 00:38:48.670]  But, I mean, how obvious, General, how obvious is it?
[00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:54.114]  When we got the memos saying, well, these are Wellian terms, I mean, these are public.
[00:38:54.454 --> 00:38:59.778]  Well, we can torture somebody to death, and if we don't mean to kill them, and we don't call it torture, it isn't torture.
[00:38:59.798 --> 00:39:05.303]  I mean, torturing people to death, folks, and this happens all the time, and then the Congress
[00:39:06.063 --> 00:39:17.250]  You know, 90 to 9, the Senate says, no more torture, you've got to follow the manual, you've got to follow the law, the regulations, and then Bush says, no, I'm going to veto that!
[00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:24.314]  I mean, look, he's sending people to prison, little nothings, like England and Grainer,
[00:39:24.614 --> 00:39:34.817]  They're obviously psychopaths, but the point is, they're sending them to prison for following their degenerate orders of the handlers that were in there controlling them, that took the photos, that thought it was cute.
[00:39:35.077 --> 00:39:39.638]  Meanwhile, Bush is on TV saying, I'm going to veto, we're going to torture!
[00:39:40.138 --> 00:39:41.198]  Right, what are they afraid of?
[00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:47.800]  Why do we have to have a new law that says we're not going to torture or abuse?
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.761]  That's what the Geneva Conventions are supposed to be about.
[00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:52.643]  Why do we have to have a law?
[00:39:52.663 --> 00:39:54.426]  I think it's a step in the right direction.
[00:39:54.606 --> 00:39:59.173]  But General, even the Soviets, even the Soviets didn't admit they tortured.
[00:39:59.413 --> 00:40:00.755]  Hitler didn't admit they tortured.
[00:40:00.795 --> 00:40:05.542]  I'm sorry for interrupting, but it seems we've reached a new level here where they even admit it now.
[00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:07.023]  Well, exactly.
[00:40:07.523 --> 00:40:15.086]  Because there's overwhelming proof that it's not only been going on, but it's been directed and is likely continuing even to this day.
[00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:22.769]  I don't want to believe that it is, but the statements from people that are just returning from the theater give every indication that in fact it is.
[00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.690]  They still don't know where to draw the line.
[00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:30.332]  General, why is the torture so perverted?
[00:40:31.821 --> 00:40:47.297]  Well, I think, you know, to me, when they use, particularly women, this sexual overtones, using a woman to try to get an Iraqi man to, or a Muslim man, to break and to give them information.
[00:40:47.717 --> 00:41:00.106]  This is insulting and humiliating, not only to the female that they're using to do the interrogation, but they're getting some kind of bizarre sense of pleasure, the interrogators are, watching this whole thing take place.
[00:41:00.206 --> 00:41:02.068]  I know, this is something out of a horror movie!
[00:41:02.148 --> 00:41:07.952]  Naked women putting... putting... I mean, I hate to use this, but we have to... menstrual fluids on men?
[00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:14.197]  I mean, this is... Exactly, and who studied the Arab culture to come up with such an idea?
[00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:17.591]  I mean, this is insulting to anybody.
[00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:21.634]  But I mean, if I made a horror movie where the military was doing this, people wouldn't believe it.
[00:41:21.674 --> 00:41:22.595]  It's so bizarre.
[00:41:22.975 --> 00:41:23.716]  It is bizarre.
[00:41:23.876 --> 00:41:35.605]  And the fact that they're using female soldiers to conduct this demonstrates what they're thinking about the likely role for women in the military.
[00:41:35.625 --> 00:41:40.469]  Well, listen, if they told me in the military, go in there and do something to a woman, I'd be, you can go to hell.
[00:41:40.769 --> 00:41:41.290]  Exactly.
[00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.152]  And I think the majority of soldiers that are serving today would do exactly that.
[00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:49.593]  They'd say, hold on a second, I am not going to do that.
[00:41:50.233 --> 00:41:54.815]  And they could threaten your career, they could do anything they needed to, but I would take the same position.
[00:41:54.995 --> 00:41:55.895]  Oh no, I'm not.
[00:41:56.355 --> 00:42:02.598]  And that's why they took every effort to keep me away from getting any information about what was going on.
[00:42:02.618 --> 00:42:05.419]  And then they tried to burn you because you had been investigating it.
[00:42:05.699 --> 00:42:06.179]  That's right.
[00:42:06.539 --> 00:42:08.400]  And because I would have objected
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.542]  I would have complained to the top level.
[00:42:11.702 --> 00:42:13.723]  I never would have allowed this to take place.
[00:42:13.823 --> 00:42:14.903]  What was the breaking point?
[00:42:14.944 --> 00:42:17.845]  I mean, when did you decide to not roll over and fight him?
[00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:28.571]  When I was down in Kuwait and I was waiting for... I spoke to General Toguba in the conference room down in Kuwait and he had six other men in the room with him.
[00:42:30.192 --> 00:42:30.652]  Excuse me.
[00:42:32.693 --> 00:42:35.315]  And when he was asking me questions and he was insisting
[00:42:36.357 --> 00:42:37.478]  And I was holding my ground.
[00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:39.100]  I said, no, I was not in charge.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.241]  No, I did not know this was going on.
[00:42:41.382 --> 00:42:44.684]  No, these soldiers are not derelict in the performance of their duties.
[00:42:45.265 --> 00:42:48.268]  I explained every single question that he presented to me.
[00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:56.495]  And when I saw the results of his investigation or from that interview, and he had the nerve to say that I was emotional.
[00:42:58.148 --> 00:43:02.189]  Well, I wasn't the one with tears coming out of my eyes at the end of the interview.
[00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:14.573]  It was him and his six comrades, because they knew what they were doing was wrong, and they knew that they were going to be called to accuse me for things that clearly I was not responsible for.
[00:43:14.593 --> 00:43:20.154]  Well, that's encouraging, though, that they were crying, because that means they've still got souls at least.
[00:43:20.795 --> 00:43:21.815]  Well, one would hope.
[00:43:23.035 --> 00:43:24.436]  But I didn't see any evidence.
[00:43:24.536 --> 00:43:27.038]  They were feeling pretty guilty trying to railroad you.
[00:43:27.058 --> 00:43:32.180]  They knew that this was a compartmentalized operation, and that's now public folks.
[00:43:33.121 --> 00:43:39.864]  Absolutely, and not only that, but General Toguba was not instructed to investigate the photographs from cell block 180.
[00:43:39.904 --> 00:43:44.147]  But even his report admits raping, acid, all of this.
[00:43:44.227 --> 00:43:50.010]  Yes, but he still held the MPs from the 800th MP Brigade responsible.
[00:43:50.692 --> 00:43:55.875]  Because he said his instructions were limited to the 800th MP Brigade.
[00:43:56.375 --> 00:44:05.620]  So he had to turn over the investigation for a subsequent investigation by General Fay, who looked into the military intelligence.
[00:44:05.741 --> 00:44:09.102]  Did you tell him, I'm going to fight this propaganda?
[00:44:09.122 --> 00:44:09.222]  I did.
[00:44:09.363 --> 00:44:15.346]  I told General McKiernan when he made the decision that I should not be reprimanded, that I should not be relieved.
[00:44:15.985 --> 00:44:19.568]  And he allowed me to go back to the United States, and that was in April of 2004.
[00:44:21.269 --> 00:44:30.936]  I told him that we needed, when I got back to the States, it was my intent to at least have an after-action review and make sure none of this ever happened again.
[00:44:30.956 --> 00:44:37.401]  And he said to me as I was leaving his office, there's a great future for Janis Karpinski in the Army Reserves.
[00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:40.343]  He was the commander in the theater.
[00:44:40.723 --> 00:44:43.906]  By the time I got back to the United States and the pictures were released,
[00:44:44.582 --> 00:44:53.286]  The Chief of the Army Reserves is now using the Taguba Report as the sacred document and is suspending me and ultimately relieving me from command.
[00:44:53.486 --> 00:44:58.348]  And he has never spoken a word to me since I've been back in the United States.
[00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:01.029]  Now let's talk about wargaming.
[00:45:01.049 --> 00:45:03.750]  Folks, we're talking to a lady of such incredible courage.
[00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.091]  You can hear the genuineness, but I don't go off of that.
[00:45:06.772 --> 00:45:08.893]  I don't, you know, just go off of my discernment.
[00:45:09.033 --> 00:45:09.973]  I have researched this.
[00:45:10.013 --> 00:45:11.754]  We've done 50 shows on this.
[00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.752]  It's the same thing at Camp X-Ray.
[00:45:16.053 --> 00:45:18.075]  They sequester, they cloister.
[00:45:18.835 --> 00:45:22.339]  The regular Army, the regular Marines are not even allowed into these areas.
[00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:28.924]  Then they've got the nerve to try to blame people that had no connection to it and that didn't go along with it.
[00:45:28.944 --> 00:45:30.546]  So that really makes me mad.
[00:45:30.566 --> 00:45:31.607]  But let's talk about war games.
[00:45:31.647 --> 00:45:33.529]  We know they say Iraq is a laboratory.
[00:45:33.869 --> 00:45:37.072]  We know they say that these prisons are laboratories, that Afghanistan is.
[00:45:37.832 --> 00:45:40.634]  And they send these cadres around making larger cadres.
[00:45:40.914 --> 00:45:50.501]  I think it's pretty clear that we are seeing the cold-blooded formation of a torture corps, and that these cadres are being expanded.
[00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.162]  Is that frightening to you?
[00:45:53.202 --> 00:45:54.063]  Does that concern you?
[00:45:54.123 --> 00:45:58.486]  Or do you agree with my statement that they're forming a large torture corps?
[00:45:59.798 --> 00:46:10.742]  I don't know if they'll be so bold as to call it that, but yes, I agree with you and it makes me shudder when I think about it because they took some contract interrogators to Iraq.
[00:46:11.142 --> 00:46:24.726]  They took some contract interrogators and put them at Abu Ghraib, testing to see what the response of the prisoners would be, testing more importantly to see what the response of soldiers would be to those interrogators taking over a military function.
[00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:27.507]  So now we know that that's an encroachment
[00:46:28.227 --> 00:46:32.870]  We know the quality of some of the contractors that were down at the Coalition Provisional Authority.
[00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:41.534]  Some of them had been fired from previous assignments, specifically at prisons, and they were fired for allegations of abuse of prisoners.
[00:46:42.334 --> 00:46:44.255]  In one case, it caused the death of a prisoner.
[00:46:44.836 --> 00:46:46.256]  So there's this encroachment.
[00:46:48.004 --> 00:46:51.146]  They're actually scouring the planet for scum!
[00:46:51.366 --> 00:47:00.433]  Yes, for people who have this kind of mindset, who can live with themselves while they're going forth in this global war on terrorism and trying to make a difference.
[00:47:01.053 --> 00:47:11.881]  But, you know, it's important to understand that even the McCain bill that was passed by overwhelming victory, 90 to 9, it's limited to the military.
[00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.793]  For people who are subject to the UCFJ.
[00:47:17.893 --> 00:47:19.975]  We need a law on contractors on everybody!
[00:47:20.075 --> 00:47:20.836]  Absolutely!
[00:47:21.116 --> 00:47:21.657]  Absolutely!
[00:47:21.737 --> 00:47:22.598]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[00:47:22.618 --> 00:47:30.926]  If somebody kidnaps a woman and goes and rapes her, I mean, is his defense gonna be, hey, I was just blowing off steam like Rush Limbaugh said, and torture's no big deal?
[00:47:31.226 --> 00:47:32.468]  I thought she was a terrorist.
[00:47:33.008 --> 00:47:33.388]  Yeah.
[00:47:33.929 --> 00:47:35.710]  I was trying to get information from her.
[00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:36.810]  I mean, let's think about this, folks.
[00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:47.396]  Since when is beating people to death and raping someone's wife in front of them, because their papers weren't in order at a checkpoint, because the fat slob just wants to rape somebody, since when is that what Americans do?
[00:47:47.416 --> 00:47:49.477]  Since never.
[00:47:49.677 --> 00:47:50.898]  We don't do those kind of things.
[00:47:50.938 --> 00:47:51.718]  We're better than this.
[00:47:53.439 --> 00:47:55.120]  General, what would you like to see happen?
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.481]  I mean, obviously, I think Gonzales
[00:47:58.078 --> 00:48:03.520]  But any general who we have paper trails on, knowingly part of this, I think they all need to go to prison.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.240]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:19.504]  The Inspector General, who was not the Inspector General for most of the investigation, the one who made the decision to clear General Sanchez, General Wojciechowski, General Fass, Colonel Warren, Colonel Pappas, and General Miller.
[00:48:20.377 --> 00:48:28.121]  Uh, you know, was only there at the, at the direction of Secretary Rumsfeld and that was the first thing, the first action he took was to release those findings.
[00:48:28.941 --> 00:48:35.664]  Um, it says specifically in the IG report that actions I took or failed to take in no way contributed to the abuses at Abu Ghraib.
[00:48:36.284 --> 00:48:41.087]  But most people don't have access to the Inspector General's report, or don't take the time to go look for it.
[00:48:41.107 --> 00:48:42.949]  They really have besmirched your name.
[00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:44.309]  Yes, they have.
[00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:57.178]  And then, when they do a separate investigation on Guantanamo Bay, the recommendation is that they reprimand General Miller for letting interrogations get out of control, even though he was directed to do those things.
[00:48:57.698 --> 00:49:01.021]  And his boss said, no, I'm not going to reprimand him.
[00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:05.824]  And his boss just happened to be the former military aide to Secretary Rumsfeld.
[00:49:07.003 --> 00:49:10.007]  So they're all proving that their hands are dirty.
[00:49:10.027 --> 00:49:11.349]  I want people to think about this.
[00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:13.953]  One is covering up the other for the other for the other.
[00:49:15.254 --> 00:49:20.502]  I want people to think about the fact that our current Attorney General, the supposed guy enforcing all these laws,
[00:49:21.152 --> 00:49:26.595]  He's writing memos saying Bush is above the law and the law flows from him, saying he's an emperor.
[00:49:26.675 --> 00:49:28.036]  I mean, that's the actual memo.
[00:49:28.436 --> 00:49:29.616]  Saying torture's good.
[00:49:29.636 --> 00:49:36.380]  I want people to realize that General Shoemaker is the guy who sent Delta Force in at Waco.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:44.784]  I want people to know that they are now putting in a constellation, a gaggle, of people that are willing to do this.
[00:49:44.864 --> 00:49:47.245]  I tell you, General, this is really scary.
[00:49:47.526 --> 00:49:49.947]  Well, this scares me, too, and I agree with you because
[00:49:51.468 --> 00:49:53.349]  They have rewritten the dictionary.
[00:49:54.170 --> 00:50:10.681]  There's a prisoner of war, and then there's an Iraqi detainee, or a prisoner, an Iraqi criminal, and then there's this category of security detainees that seem to be apart from any of the Geneva Conventions and not subject to the rules that military personnel have followed for years.
[00:50:11.102 --> 00:50:13.904]  Now you bring into that equation contractors.
[00:50:14.464 --> 00:50:19.688]  Who are not subject to the UCMJ or appear to be above the rules.
[00:50:19.788 --> 00:50:25.212]  So we haven't gotten it right yet, although the bill unfortunately moves in the right direction.
[00:50:25.672 --> 00:50:28.834]  And now, well at least it forced Bush to go public and say he's for torture.
[00:50:29.274 --> 00:50:38.481]  I mean it really put the spotlight on these guys, but I just can't believe we're even having to sit here and debate this and talk about this, but they are being exposed.
[00:50:38.881 --> 00:50:41.543]  Our final segment with the General
[00:50:42.542 --> 00:50:46.506]  I might take a call or two, but we're also going to plug your books, so get your pens and paper ready for that.
[00:50:47.306 --> 00:50:48.968]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:50:49.488 --> 00:50:57.735]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv as we fight this tyranny.
[00:50:57.755 --> 00:50:58.336]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:03.081]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.241 --> 00:51:06.344]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.484 --> 00:51:10.368]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.428 --> 00:51:14.673]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.013 --> 00:51:18.777]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.877 --> 00:51:20.719]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:24.222]  Riot police attack people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.262 --> 00:51:28.967]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.147 --> 00:51:32.190]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.233]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.713 --> 00:51:41.839]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.359 --> 00:51:46.143]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:17.879 --> 00:52:22.084]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:22.384 --> 00:52:26.308]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:33.056]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:33.296 --> 00:52:38.762]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:39.002 --> 00:52:45.927]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:53:01.783 --> 00:53:02.324]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.205 --> 00:53:17.586]  I think so.
[00:53:37.486 --> 00:53:37.886]  I think so.
[00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:07.347]  We're good to go.
[00:54:23.487 --> 00:54:28.609]  I don't want to hear from people that, well, you know, something this big, it would come out, we would know.
[00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:45.435]  On every front, from the financial war profiteering, to the attack on the Bill of Rights, to protecting terrorist groups, to, you know, all of this, that this current cabal is engaged in, it all has come out.
[00:54:45.895 --> 00:54:47.056]  People do blow the whistle.
[00:54:47.096 --> 00:54:48.216]  People do tell the truth.
[00:54:48.883 --> 00:54:54.308]  But a lot of the news media owned by the very financial interests that stand to gain from this try to spin it.
[00:54:54.568 --> 00:54:58.291]  That's why the alternative media is exploding in size because people aren't buying it anymore.
[00:54:59.152 --> 00:55:07.519]  The General has graciously decided to stay with us over five minutes to the next hour so we can get to Tony and Larry and a few others and we're about to go to your calls.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:15.326]  But the new book by General Janice Larpinski is One Woman's Army.
[00:55:16.497 --> 00:55:18.119]  One Woman's Arming.
[00:55:18.679 --> 00:55:25.285]  And General, tell us a little bit about the book and tell us about the publisher and some of the websites.
[00:55:25.365 --> 00:55:38.415]  The book is really about my, from when I grew up wanting to be in the military and then my military career and what led me to promotion to Brigadier General and then my assignment as the commander of the 800th MP Brigade.
[00:55:39.496 --> 00:55:42.459]  I felt like I really needed to reestablish my credibility
[00:55:43.004 --> 00:55:54.671]  Because it was widely destroyed by the spin from linking my name to those, exclusively my name, to those photographs and my leadership failures.
[00:55:55.612 --> 00:55:57.473]  It was important.
[00:55:57.613 --> 00:55:59.074]  It was an important story to tell.
[00:55:59.094 --> 00:56:09.301]  I wanted women especially, but people around the world to understand that there are conscientious people in the military and we serve for a variety of reasons.
[00:56:10.131 --> 00:56:14.713]  Abu Ghraib and Iraq was a situation that was clearly out of control.
[00:56:14.733 --> 00:56:19.876]  And certainly not, we weren't able to rein it in on my watch.
[00:56:20.496 --> 00:56:23.458]  And this is of course published by Miramax Books.
[00:56:24.458 --> 00:56:29.881]  And for those that also, General, kind of out of left field here, have you ever heard of P2OG?
[00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:29.981]  No.
[00:56:32.959 --> 00:56:40.526]  Well, that's a secret Pentagon paper and Pentagon operation group with funding of upwards of six billion dollars per year.
[00:56:41.247 --> 00:56:44.610]  And it was formed on the eve of the Gulf War by Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.432]  Just type P-2-O-G into Google.
[00:56:46.812 --> 00:56:48.334]  Most people in the military don't feel bad.
[00:56:48.374 --> 00:56:51.076]  I've never even heard of it because it's another compartmentalized group.
[00:56:51.457 --> 00:56:53.899]  Where Rumsfeld said, stimulate terrorist attacks.
[00:56:54.199 --> 00:57:09.027]  have breakdown and that actually his goal was to, we have an Israeli document from 83 saying this too, is to have Iraq in turmoil, in civil war, never being a strong area and then using it as a launch base to then attack Syria and Iran.
[00:57:09.067 --> 00:57:15.231]  So in a way they actually want to fail so we have an excuse to stay there longer and build those permanent bases.
[00:57:15.251 --> 00:57:16.231]  Would you like to comment on that?
[00:57:16.912 --> 00:57:19.453]  I would because from July of 2003 when we arrived in Iraq
[00:57:21.534 --> 00:57:24.955]  It really did seem like we would only be there for a couple more months.
[00:57:25.836 --> 00:57:35.379]  Things to the north and the south of Baghdad seemed to be generally peaceful and returning to life as we knew it and certainly back under Iraqi control.
[00:57:35.879 --> 00:57:43.262]  But Baghdad and the surrounding vicinity, including the Sunni Triangle, was very resistant and somehow they capitalized on that.
[00:57:44.237 --> 00:57:51.281]  Instead of exploiting the peace, they capitalized on the insurgent activity and made the situation completely worse.
[00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:55.182]  And it grew increasingly worse over the next months.
[00:57:56.123 --> 00:58:04.607]  After they captured Uday, or killed Uday and Kuse in that operation in Seoul, the insurgents were more active than ever and they were becoming
[00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:07.490]  Uh, more accurate than ever before.
[00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.451]  Well, also, I mean, the military's not stupid.
[00:58:09.471 --> 00:58:12.693]  I've talked to so many, you know, experts who were in Vietnam fighting insurgencies.
[00:58:13.293 --> 00:58:17.936]  If one person shoots at you from a little village, you don't arrest every man down to the age of 11.
[00:58:18.596 --> 00:58:20.957]  You don't bulldoze all their date palms.
[00:58:21.637 --> 00:58:22.938]  I mean, you just made enemies.
[00:58:23.018 --> 00:58:24.419]  But they did this over and over again.
[00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:32.506]  He went over again and they took the women as hostages so they could get the men to come in, to turn themselves in.
[00:58:33.046 --> 00:58:38.891]  I mean, everything you could think of that would insult an Arab mindset and an Arab family.
[00:58:38.992 --> 00:58:39.672]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.692 --> 00:58:40.353]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:59.105 --> 00:59:00.165]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.865 --> 00:59:02.005]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:03.466]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.206 --> 00:59:05.146]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.766 --> 00:59:09.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.947 --> 00:59:14.108]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.208 --> 00:59:20.489]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:20.609 --> 00:59:21.189]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:21.209 --> 00:59:23.010]  Central Standard Time, we're here live.
[00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:24.370]  Hey, but Bob,
[00:59:25.246 --> 00:59:26.227]  Others, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:26.247 --> 00:59:27.608]  We've got Texamars joining us.
[00:59:27.628 --> 00:59:31.331]  We have Barbara Lee Fisher cutting up the Vaccine Awareness Network.
[00:59:31.811 --> 00:59:32.992]  Very serious laws.
[00:59:34.033 --> 00:59:43.560]  Very close to passing for total vaccine maker liability protection and forced inoculation and federalization of your local towns and cities for forced inoculation.
[00:59:45.091 --> 00:59:45.712]  That's coming up.
[00:59:45.732 --> 00:59:47.473]  We'll be talking about Halloween here in a few minutes.
[00:59:48.133 --> 00:59:50.555]  Let's go ahead and talk to Abe in Florida.
[00:59:50.735 --> 00:59:51.516]  Abe, you're on the air.
[00:59:51.536 --> 00:59:52.897]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[00:59:52.997 --> 00:59:54.178]  I'm in full support of your work.
[00:59:54.538 --> 00:59:55.839]  Thank you.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.441]  I just wanted to touch on a few points.
[00:59:59.782 --> 01:00:04.626]  The last week, I was flipping through television and just seeing what was on.
[01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:12.152]  MTV, the wasteland that it is, there's this show called Punk whereby they stimulate an environment to try to
[01:00:12.697 --> 01:00:13.357]  We're good to go.
[01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:42.065]  Yeah, it's all very overt.
[01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.066]  Oh, we're all going to have chips.
[01:00:44.286 --> 01:00:45.346]  Oh, we're all going to have cards.
[01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:46.267]  Oh, it's good.
[01:00:46.587 --> 01:00:50.408]  And it doesn't matter if 90 plus percent of us are against it in major polls.
[01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:53.550]  They'll keep repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating.
[01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:57.588]  Well that's just how you domesticate a wild horse.
[01:00:57.968 --> 01:01:03.672]  You just keep getting in the pen with it over and over and over again until it just gets used to you and accustomed to you.
[01:01:03.912 --> 01:01:10.196]  We have to consciously realize how they're manipulating us and be insulted by it and resist it.
[01:01:10.954 --> 01:01:12.015]  Right, right.
[01:01:12.075 --> 01:01:16.680]  But do you think, at this point, that we could just reach the mass of Americans?
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:32.317]  Because, I mean, there's just... I'm a college student myself, and when I talk to, you know, fellow college students, they're just... they're completely oblivious to the fact that, you know, life isn't just what it teaches you in school, and in the new world, they just have no comprehension of
[01:01:33.881 --> 01:01:41.146]  A lot of that is because we've been trained to, number one, be soft, and to be lazy, and to be self-centered, and to only feed our animal instincts.
[01:01:41.206 --> 01:01:43.168]  But they're not going to be satisfied.
[01:01:43.188 --> 01:01:44.289]  That's never satisfying.
[01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:48.532]  They're going to want the higher levels of understanding.
[01:01:49.312 --> 01:01:51.254]  And they're going to be abused by this system.
[01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:55.076]  So plant the seeds and know that they will sprout.
[01:01:55.417 --> 01:01:57.698]  And it's never been a majority that change things, sir.
[01:01:58.078 --> 01:02:00.860]  We already have well more than what our founding fathers had at 5%.
[01:02:03.495 --> 01:02:04.255]  Oh, okay, okay.
[01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:26.521]  Yeah, I was also watching The Simpsons last night, and when you spoke about how they're trying to reach you on television, it was just so weird when you spoke about it, and then I thought to myself, they showed guns being destroyed, homework destroyed, you know, he asked them cops, and they tried to, you know, just play it down because it's a cartoon.
[01:02:26.981 --> 01:02:30.062]  They showed guns being destroyed, and then a nuclear bomb going off,
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:41.808]  And then right after that, I was like, oh my gosh, you know, that's just, that's crazy how they just, you know, blatantly put that, well not blatantly, but indirectly put it in the cartoon.
[01:02:41.908 --> 01:02:43.769]  It's called operant conditioning.
[01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:46.431]  Yeah, yeah, and David, I know you don't,
[01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.911]  I completely agree with some of this stuff, and it is truly bizarre.
[01:02:50.411 --> 01:02:55.052]  But the secret of the matrix, you said that these people are targeting the unconscious part of the brain.
[01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:58.093]  Well that's, sir, that's Edward Bernays, that's mainstream.
[01:02:58.293 --> 01:02:58.974]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:59.474 --> 01:03:08.977]  See what David does, I think David's a nice guy, is he talks about all this real stuff, then he adds things to it that can't be proven, and hence, then people think all the proven stuff may not be true.
[01:03:10.437 --> 01:03:16.959]  When you take a mid-level advertising class at a good university, they will, this is openly taught,
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:26.004]  Okay, the conscious mind is up here in the cerebral cortex, but the subconscious brain catalogues and is hooked into the instincts and everything.
[01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:29.346]  And that's what's being hit.
[01:03:30.447 --> 01:03:33.628]  That's why it's good to not watch a lot of TV or be very selective about it.
[01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:42.013]  I mean, even if I try to watch a show about dolphins, at the end it's give up all your property, world government's good, the animals are dying.
[01:03:42.793 --> 01:03:44.334]  Everything has the propaganda in it.
[01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.007]  And there's subliminals, too.
[01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:47.087]  I mean, big time.
[01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:49.508]  By the way, subliminals are public.
[01:03:49.788 --> 01:03:54.669]  That's not a... The industry will admit that if you just read about it.
[01:03:54.689 --> 01:03:57.550]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.370]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:04.391]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.731 --> 01:04:09.152]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.572 --> 01:04:13.733]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.973 --> 01:04:16.815]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:21.579]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.779 --> 01:04:26.203]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.423 --> 01:04:33.649]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.889 --> 01:04:36.311]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:54.227 --> 01:05:58.129]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.991]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:01.331]  But not just any water.
[01:06:01.411 --> 01:06:05.634]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.

[01:06:45.528 --> 01:06:45.848]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:06:54.770 --> 01:07:00.792]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.412 --> 01:07:04.452]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:16.075 --> 01:07:18.536]  Alright, we have Tex Mars on the line with us.
[01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:23.017]  We'll be going to my good friend, the professor, here in just a moment to give you the history of Halloween.
[01:07:24.406 --> 01:07:41.970]  But just to recap, Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, who is supposedly a socialist, but he took land taken by neocon governments in the past and gave it back to the indigenous population with the deeds.
[01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:54.032]  So our government, the Supreme Court, is ruling that we don't own private property and if some private robber baron wants it, they can come and take it and not even pay you fair market value.
[01:07:54.895 --> 01:08:09.324]  That's literally like feudal lords 800 years ago in ancient England in the days of Longshanks just saying, I want your property, I want your wife, I want your daughter, I'm taking your sons as slaves to serve in my military.
[01:08:10.824 --> 01:08:13.046]  I mean, that's slavery, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:13.086 --> 01:08:15.847]  We forget that it isn't just black Americans who were slaves.
[01:08:15.887 --> 01:08:23.492]  A lot of white people came here as indentured servants, and you never got out of your seven years of indentured servitude because they'd get you into debt and you'd be a sharecropper.
[01:08:26.132 --> 01:08:28.613]  But that's a side issue with Hugo Chavez.
[01:08:32.014 --> 01:08:47.801]  The point is, he's getting off the IMF and World Bank, he's getting out of the system, he's got his own oil, and now he's saying that our government is satanic, that this is a way to terrorize the public, that dressing up like demons is bad, that it's not our way, that it's not Christian.
[01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:50.692]  And I have a lady that cleans our house.
[01:08:51.092 --> 01:08:51.793]  Because I'm too busy.
[01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:53.374]  My wife's too busy working all the time to do it.
[01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:56.175]  She's got her green card, folks.
[01:08:56.195 --> 01:08:56.535]  Don't worry.
[01:08:56.575 --> 01:08:57.376]  I don't hire illegals.
[01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.017]  Really sweet, nice lady.
[01:09:00.718 --> 01:09:04.080]  And she's from Brazil.
[01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:08.963]  And I was talking to her last week and I said, Oh, Halloween's coming up.
[01:09:09.003 --> 01:09:10.323]  And she said, Oh no, I don't.
[01:09:10.784 --> 01:09:11.864]  We don't celebrate that.
[01:09:11.924 --> 01:09:12.765]  That is Diablo.
[01:09:12.785 --> 01:09:14.106]  And I said, Oh really?
[01:09:14.126 --> 01:09:15.546]  She goes, Yes, it's a festival of the devil.
[01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:16.487]  We don't worship the devil.
[01:09:17.037 --> 01:09:19.280]  And I said, oh, I don't worship the devil either.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.861]  We don't celebrate that.
[01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:23.625]  So, there's a lot of things down in Latin America.
[01:09:23.645 --> 01:09:24.946]  Now, in Mexico they do, folks.
[01:09:24.966 --> 01:09:27.189]  And they got the Day of the Dead and all that.
[01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.750]  You got that whole Aztec influence.
[01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:30.873]  But not in South America, folks.
[01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:31.854]  Not in Central America.
[01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:42.331]  And BBC admits, quote, Halloween, a pagan festival characterized by mischief making, is marked every year on October 31st of October.
[01:09:42.771 --> 01:09:50.177]  And it is the year Halloween has the most murders and abductions and most violence of any day in the year.
[01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:59.284]  And what it's number three for DWI's, what Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving's number one and number two is
[01:10:01.218 --> 01:10:06.402]  Number two is New Year's, but the point is, hundreds of homes burned down in Detroit on Devil's Night.
[01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:10.505]  Why would you let your children be part of this?
[01:10:10.545 --> 01:10:29.780]  Even if you don't believe in God, which I think is foolish, you should know, folks, having your child dress up in an outfit and go demand something from someone, that's what the Druid priests would come and demand, your horse, demand your oxen, demand your cat, demand your child, to burn them, to kill them, to slit their throats, to throw them in a peat bog.
[01:10:31.092 --> 01:10:32.992]  Were we able to get Tex on a better phone there, guys?
[01:10:35.873 --> 01:10:36.373]  Okay, good.
[01:10:36.573 --> 01:10:37.674]  I was waiting for the cue on that.
[01:10:38.854 --> 01:10:40.474]  So honored to have Tex Mars.
[01:10:40.534 --> 01:10:43.515]  PowerofProphecy.com, of course.
[01:10:43.795 --> 01:10:48.836]  TexMars.com and ConspiracyWorld.com.
[01:10:49.596 --> 01:10:51.957]  Best-selling author, Air Force officer.
[01:10:52.397 --> 01:10:54.378]  He married my wife and I. Good friend of mine.
[01:10:54.438 --> 01:10:55.458]  Always good to have him back up.
[01:10:56.038 --> 01:10:58.279]  And Tex, thank you for coming on with us today.
[01:10:58.739 --> 01:11:00.099]  Hey Alex, great to be with you.
[01:11:01.835 --> 01:11:07.457]  Halloween, Tex, why should we not celebrate Halloween?
[01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:10.718]  Why should we keep our children out of Samhain or Samhain?
[01:11:11.739 --> 01:11:18.161]  Well, you mentioned Samhain or Samhain as many call it.
[01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:29.985]  First of all, Alex, we're not against at all kids having a good time or parents having a good time or even though it's probably not the
[01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:35.711]  Most healthy, eating a lot of sweets at a given time of year.
[01:11:36.111 --> 01:11:39.772]  I think I've eaten too many sweets and it's put a lot of pounds on me over the years.
[01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:43.473]  But here is the absolute truth of Halloween.
[01:11:44.394 --> 01:11:48.035]  It has always been a satanic day.
[01:11:48.715 --> 01:11:49.895]  It is a witchcraft day.
[01:11:50.376 --> 01:11:56.358]  You know, in the witchcraft calendar, there are eight sabbats.
[01:11:56.638 --> 01:11:57.638]  The second
[01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:17.304]  Most powerful day of witchcraft for all witches and you can talk to the head of the Church of Wicca or the Salem witchcraft sect and all of those but the second most important day is this day Halloween and it comes of course from pagan sources.
[01:12:17.344 --> 01:12:25.366]  It really was not practiced in the United States until 1845 when many people from Ireland and Scotland came over after the
[01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:28.674]  The horrible potato famine.
[01:12:29.895 --> 01:12:31.956]  So many immigrants came to the United States from Ireland.
[01:12:32.356 --> 01:12:35.098]  Unfortunately, they brought with them the worship of the Druids.
[01:12:35.138 --> 01:12:36.419]  At least a certain number did.
[01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:43.082]  And it caught on and now has become a major holiday in the United States.
[01:12:43.102 --> 01:12:44.903]  But it is the worship of the dead.
[01:12:45.544 --> 01:12:46.904]  It is necromancy.
[01:12:47.004 --> 01:12:49.006]  It is affiliation with spirits.
[01:12:49.066 --> 01:12:53.188]  Now, I know that most parents out there are probably saying, oh, this is crazy.
[01:12:53.808 --> 01:12:55.229]  It's just a fun day.
[01:12:56.076 --> 01:13:03.178]  But we're not talking about dressing up just in costumes as historical figures or such.
[01:13:03.198 --> 01:13:04.919]  We're talking about devils.
[01:13:05.039 --> 01:13:06.720]  We're talking about witchcraft.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:15.783]  We're talking about Dracula, vampirism, and all of these things which, Alex, are based on reality.
[01:13:16.383 --> 01:13:17.823]  They are not based on myth.
[01:13:17.843 --> 01:13:19.384]  They are not based on cartoons.
[01:13:20.211 --> 01:13:21.753]  They're based on real things.
[01:13:22.233 --> 01:13:29.401]  Well, Tex, as you know, every couple weeks I see where some teenagers kidnap an old woman and cut her head off and drink her blood.
[01:13:29.421 --> 01:13:31.724]  I mean, it's exploding.
[01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.105]  Murders are exploding.
[01:13:33.726 --> 01:13:35.388]  These vampiric murders.
[01:13:35.448 --> 01:13:41.955]  Of course, they're not physical, live forever vampires, but that's where the legends come from are these murdering death cults.
[01:13:42.855 --> 01:13:44.436]  Well, Jeffrey Dahmer, that's what he did.
[01:13:44.476 --> 01:13:45.877]  He started out in the occult.
[01:13:46.277 --> 01:13:48.858]  He began to kill animals, you know, dogs and cats.
[01:13:49.398 --> 01:13:51.039]  He graduated up to human beings.
[01:13:51.079 --> 01:13:52.020]  He was an occultist.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.820]  He was a Satan worshipper.
[01:13:54.941 --> 01:13:56.882]  And then he began to be a cannibal, even.
[01:13:57.482 --> 01:14:05.386]  And, in fact, you know, Julius Caesar saw what we would call Halloween being celebrated when he conquered
[01:14:06.447 --> 01:14:09.169]  The Gallic lands and went over into Scotland.
[01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.872]  He saw the Stonehenge type of celebrations.
[01:14:13.373 --> 01:14:19.037]  He said himself that the Druids practiced not only witchcraft, this is in the writings of Julius Caesar.
[01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:24.261]  No, I actually own a volume of his letters back to Rome and he goes, these people are just totally evil.
[01:14:25.722 --> 01:14:33.668]  This is a worshipper of Mars and a worshipper of Zeus and a worshipper of all these pagan gods and he's calling it evil.
[01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:36.179]  That's right.
[01:14:36.379 --> 01:14:49.002]  Well, at least they didn't... One of the things he noted was that they would sacrifice victims to their so-called gods, and then their high priest, the Druid priest, would eat the flesh of their victims.
[01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:53.403]  So this was just abhorrent to Julius Caesar and to the Romans.
[01:14:54.643 --> 01:14:55.924]  But I believe this happens now.
[01:14:55.964 --> 01:15:01.225]  You know, I had a call some years ago from a policeman in San Antonio
[01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:08.205]  And he wanted to find out more about Halloween and what witchcraft folks do and Satanists.
[01:15:08.825 --> 01:15:24.091]  And he told me that throughout the city of San Antonio, in the environs, in the wooded areas, in the hill country, they find Satanic altars after Halloween and they actually find the bones and charred bodies of animals
[01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:28.830]  And so this is, you know, something that they wanted to try to put an end to.
[01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:39.238]  Tex, I personally found that hiking around in the hill country around Austin, because I'll go on 10-15 mile hikes, especially back in the day when I had time, and you will run into satanic alters.
[01:15:40.539 --> 01:15:41.099]  You do indeed.
[01:15:41.359 --> 01:15:46.543]  I have a picture coming up in one of my newsletters, Alex, of Liz Carpenter.
[01:15:47.304 --> 01:15:51.407]  Now remember, she was the personal secretary to Lady Burt Johnson.
[01:15:52.216 --> 01:15:57.260]  She's big in Democratic Party politics, and when Hillary Clinton came to town, you know, they met.
[01:15:58.561 --> 01:16:02.824]  Actually, a picture of her howling at the moon.
[01:16:03.304 --> 01:16:08.828]  It said that she and other feminists, on the night of the full moon, go out and howl at the moon.
[01:16:09.989 --> 01:16:12.731]  This is in witchcraft called Drawing Down the Moon.
[01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:21.737]  Here we have probably the most famous woman in Texas politics, Liz Carpenter, howling at the moon out in the hill country.
[01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:26.366]  Along with her, you know, liberal, democratic, feminist friends.
[01:16:26.546 --> 01:16:27.507]  And I interrupted you.
[01:16:27.807 --> 01:16:28.968]  Back to the police officer.
[01:16:28.988 --> 01:16:32.691]  He was calling up about all these, all these altars everywhere?
[01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:51.845]  Yeah, and he told me at that time, but this was several years back, that a number of the Humane Society shelters and such in the central Texas area, especially in San Antonio, at that time, they put a prohibition against the adopting of cats, especially black cats.
[01:16:52.944 --> 01:16:54.925]  And this is across America.
[01:16:54.985 --> 01:17:06.471]  The ASPCA and Humane Society actually know that many witchcraft sects will go and adopt animals, especially black cats, and then sacrifice them.
[01:17:06.511 --> 01:17:09.372]  So this is not just fun and games.
[01:17:09.472 --> 01:17:11.473]  These people take it seriously.
[01:17:11.513 --> 01:17:15.335]  Let me say one other thing, Alex, for people that are scratching their heads right now.
[01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:18.076]  You have exposed the Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:19.117 --> 01:17:20.958]  And what is the Bohemian Grove?
[01:17:21.383 --> 01:17:22.604]  But a meeting in the forest.
[01:17:22.624 --> 01:17:25.187]  This is the same thing the Druid priest and the others did.
[01:17:25.988 --> 01:17:32.654]  And they worshipped the great fire god and they made human sacrifice or at least had an effigy that appeared.
[01:17:32.775 --> 01:17:39.061]  So we're talking about the top politicians in America, Europe and the world that meet annually.
[01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.036]  Deep in a grove in California, you have outed this.
[01:17:43.056 --> 01:17:44.457]  You were the first one to do so.
[01:17:45.017 --> 01:17:46.878]  This is nothing more than satanic.
[01:17:47.298 --> 01:17:51.620]  Halloween is a reflection of what you found at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:57.162]  Well, Tex, I mean, look at how the violence and the murder explodes on this night.
[01:17:58.323 --> 01:18:05.406]  Well, yeah, they said that already, even here in Austin, Texas, I think 250 arrests announced last night already.
[01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.687]  We haven't even had the big celebration
[01:18:08.608 --> 01:18:09.549]  Uh, of Halloween.
[01:18:09.569 --> 01:18:14.711]  They've already gotten 250 arrests, mostly for alcohol, uh, and so forth.
[01:18:14.812 --> 01:18:16.532]  But you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:18.013]  Well, you do.
[01:18:18.213 --> 01:18:26.478]  And, uh, you know, not too long ago, uh, a mother wrote to me, sent me a news clipping.
[01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:28.119]  Maybe we can talk more about this on the break.
[01:18:28.139 --> 01:18:29.359]  Let's talk about it on the other side.
[01:18:29.379 --> 01:18:31.060]  And then maybe get a little bit into Christmas.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.361]  See, now it's not Jesus.
[01:18:32.801 --> 01:18:34.262]  Now it's a jolly elf.
[01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:44.409]  For those who don't know, Christmas was actually banned for about 20 years in England in the early 1800s because of mass murder and killing.
[01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:47.851]  Uh, yeah, Santa Claus isn't a very friendly fella.
[01:18:48.371 --> 01:18:49.891]  He's actually kinda like Freddy Krueger.
[01:18:55.593 --> 01:18:57.814]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.854 --> 01:18:59.595]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.754 --> 01:19:08.642]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:08.882 --> 01:19:11.524]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:20:56.687 --> 01:21:02.170]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:03.251]  That's right.
[01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:05.852]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:06.173 --> 01:21:13.337]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:13.877 --> 01:21:21.581]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:26.883]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:30.525]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:33.306 --> 01:21:37.448]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:37.828 --> 01:21:38.088]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:38.108 --> 01:21:40.009]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:40.089 --> 01:21:40.389]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.409 --> 01:21:40.970]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.837 --> 01:22:00.203]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:00.423 --> 01:22:05.427]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:22:05.748 --> 01:22:13.655]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:13.815 --> 01:22:20.861]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:21.081 --> 01:22:22.283]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:22.443 --> 01:22:25.828]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:25.888 --> 01:22:27.009]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:28.572]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:22:28.772 --> 01:22:35.621]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:22:35.721 --> 01:22:38.185]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:22:38.345 --> 01:22:41.266]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:22:41.286 --> 01:22:41.346]  866-885-6625.
[01:22:41.366 --> 01:22:42.226]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:22:42.246 --> 01:22:43.387]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:43.407 --> 01:22:45.307]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.592 --> 01:23:09.099]  I tell you, with guests like Tex Myers, we always have the best radio off-air during the last four minutes talking to Tex.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.923]  I was mentioning my new film, The Order of Depths, coming out.
[01:23:12.824 --> 01:23:17.030]  It's going to be put onto the same video, same DVD as Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:18.412]  It'll be available in about two, three weeks.
[01:23:19.051 --> 01:23:25.895]  But how the local pagans didn't like me mentioning how the elite was doing rituals.
[01:23:25.915 --> 01:23:27.936]  They were just mad about the policies.
[01:23:28.496 --> 01:23:37.841]  And how a year after we snuck in, we caught video of them, when Ed Homan went out there, doing their own ritual at the gates of the grove, and one of them called in Amon.
[01:23:37.861 --> 01:23:38.741]  They said, Amon.
[01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:45.624]  And then I knew it was Egyptian, but Tex just said that it corresponds to the Canaanite Moloch.
[01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:48.506]  So Tex, I tell you, it just never ends, does it?
[01:23:49.088 --> 01:23:50.108]  Well, it really doesn't.
[01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:52.849]  It's very interesting, the connection there.
[01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:55.050]  But again, we get back to the Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.811]  There's so much in the Old Testament.
[01:23:57.351 --> 01:24:02.493]  God warning about those who went to the groves and worshipped their gods.
[01:24:03.673 --> 01:24:09.515]  You know, talk about these pagans who were demonstrating against your exposures.
[01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:16.902]  And they don't like to be exposed because they get good press coverage on Halloween in the mainline media, you see.
[01:24:17.562 --> 01:24:20.304]  So they don't like it when an Alex Jones or Tex Morris comes up.
[01:24:20.665 --> 01:24:23.527]  I was in Seattle on King TV some years ago.
[01:24:24.728 --> 01:24:26.550]  And they had a big town meeting there.
[01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:30.473]  And they had all the witches come out to debate me, you know.
[01:24:30.893 --> 01:24:32.815]  And I was about the only Christian in the audience.
[01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:40.953]  And there I was, it was sort of like an Oprah Winfrey Show, except everybody was hostile against the Christians.
[01:24:41.693 --> 01:24:45.675]  But one of the witches got up and she talked about how terrible it was.
[01:24:45.775 --> 01:24:47.876]  This was, by the way, during the Halloween period.
[01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:50.297]  She said how terrible the Christians were.
[01:24:50.397 --> 01:24:52.818]  They've always persecuted witches.
[01:24:52.898 --> 01:24:58.820]  And she said, they accuse us of worshipping Satan, why we don't even believe in the devil and witchcraft.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.781]  The devil is a Christian invention.
[01:25:01.559 --> 01:25:06.943]  So, the host came to me and stuck the microphone in my face, Alex, and said, what about that?
[01:25:06.983 --> 01:25:08.684]  The witches say they don't worship the devil.
[01:25:09.405 --> 01:25:15.850]  And I looked right at this witch, and I said, you worship the goddess, do you not?
[01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.092]  She said, yes, I worship the lady of the forest.
[01:25:19.633 --> 01:25:25.217]  And I said, and you worship the consort, the male, which is Pan, right?
[01:25:25.237 --> 01:25:25.958]  The horned god.
[01:25:27.259 --> 01:25:31.700]  She said, uh, yes, but she began to stammer, actually stammer, you know.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:36.182]  She said, but Pan, the horned god we worship, that's not Satan.
[01:25:37.522 --> 01:25:38.762]  He's the god of the forest.
[01:25:39.043 --> 01:25:40.383]  I said, and he has horns.
[01:25:41.283 --> 01:25:43.504]  She said, well, yes, but that's not the devil.
[01:25:44.064 --> 01:25:49.466]  So I think it's interesting how they try to define their own terms as they would like to do it.
[01:25:50.126 --> 01:25:53.067]  You know, I have an interesting fact here, Alex, for your audience.
[01:25:53.087 --> 01:25:56.968]  A lot of kids dress up as Dracula, Count Dracula.
[01:25:57.871 --> 01:26:01.914]  And, uh, you know, Sesame Street, one of the characters is a count, like Dracula.
[01:26:02.234 --> 01:26:06.416]  I noticed even cereal is called Count Chocula, after chocolate.
[01:26:07.257 --> 01:26:13.220]  Uh, but people don't realize there literally was a real Dracula.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.201]  And Bush and Kerry are related to him.
[01:26:15.802 --> 01:26:17.323]  Yeah, I have heard that.
[01:26:17.363 --> 01:26:18.944]  That's actually been proven.
[01:26:19.184 --> 01:26:21.105]  Yeah, MSNBC did the genealogy.
[01:26:21.761 --> 01:26:23.101]  Well, this is an interesting thing.
[01:26:23.142 --> 01:26:34.085]  Now, there's a book, and I had a copy of it some years ago, and I did research, and it's on a ruler in Eastern Europe named Vlad, V-L-A-D, the Impaler.
[01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:36.086]  Yeah, Vlad the Dragon, the Impaler.
[01:26:36.506 --> 01:26:38.967]  Yeah, and he killed over 100,000 people.
[01:26:39.007 --> 01:26:43.088]  He was ruler of a small nation, and he tortured them.
[01:26:43.108 --> 01:26:48.270]  He would impale their bodies on spears, and he literally would drink blood.
[01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.210]  Over 100,000.
[01:26:51.141 --> 01:26:55.085]  He locked many of them into a palace and burned them alive.
[01:26:56.406 --> 01:26:58.268]  That's how he got rid of the beggars and the homeless.
[01:26:58.308 --> 01:27:00.550]  He just locked them up and burned them alive.
[01:27:01.691 --> 01:27:04.133]  But this was a real character.
[01:27:04.193 --> 01:27:10.879]  So when you play around with Dracula, you're really imitating a real character.
[01:27:11.119 --> 01:27:13.402]  Well, I see people dressed up like Jeffrey Dahmer.
[01:27:13.902 --> 01:27:14.743]  Or Ted Bundy.
[01:27:14.823 --> 01:27:15.944]  It's like it's real funny.
[01:27:16.801 --> 01:27:17.902]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[01:27:17.962 --> 01:27:33.736]  Well, you know, I think it was Jason, or no, Freddy, Freddy Krueger, from one of the movies, he actually said he studied the life of Ted Bundy and used that as an inspiration for how he, his mannerisms and such, and how he acted.
[01:27:33.756 --> 01:27:42.764]  You know, back to Vlad, the Impaler, it's interesting that Lenin, you know, was not the monster of the Red Terror,
[01:27:43.379 --> 01:27:46.822]  Who murdered so many Christians and others in Soviet Russia.
[01:27:48.183 --> 01:27:50.104]  His first name was Vladimir.
[01:27:50.925 --> 01:27:51.706]  He named himself.
[01:27:51.746 --> 01:27:52.966]  That was not his real name.
[01:27:53.327 --> 01:27:54.448]  He was born with another name.
[01:27:54.908 --> 01:27:57.050]  But he named himself Vladimir.
[01:27:57.650 --> 01:27:58.491]  After Vlad.
[01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:08.779]  And it may even be of interest to people that Putin, the current, you know, he was with the KGB and now he's the new dictator, basically, of Russia.
[01:28:09.499 --> 01:28:11.361]  And his name is Vladimir.
[01:28:12.857 --> 01:28:21.599]  Well, we know that they were called the Red Chair of the Red Star, and it's actually talked about, this is well documented, where they're killing all these people, and he goes, I need more, more blood!
[01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:24.220]  More blood, he literally called out for that.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:32.201]  And May 1 is the highest holy day in witchcraft, and that was the day they celebrated the coming of communism.
[01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:33.501]  May 1, May Day.
[01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:36.042]  May Day, how cute!
[01:28:36.822 --> 01:28:37.662]  It's friendly.
[01:28:37.702 --> 01:28:40.943]  We'll be right back with Tex Mars, more about Halloween, more about his new book, too.
[01:28:43.738 --> 01:28:46.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.026 --> 01:29:00.350]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:05.954]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:09.336]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:29:10.077 --> 01:29:10.477]  We're good to go.

[01:29:53.647 --> 01:29:59.889]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.009 --> 01:30:06.192]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.452 --> 01:30:14.895]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.135 --> 01:30:22.158]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:27.281]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.501 --> 01:30:32.905]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.245 --> 01:30:36.327]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.668 --> 01:30:44.633]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.361]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:30:56.922 --> 01:30:58.223]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:30:58.663 --> 01:31:01.325]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:31:01.825 --> 01:31:04.487]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:31:04.908 --> 01:31:11.393]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:31:34.747 --> 01:31:36.268]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:31:46.519 --> 01:31:47.700]  Osama Bin Forgotten?

[01:31:51.883 --> 01:32:03.212]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:32:03.792 --> 01:32:04.793]  A gun on my hip.
[01:32:04.813 --> 01:32:07.675]  Tex Marsh is going to be with us about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:32:07.715 --> 01:32:08.696]  Your calls are coming up.

[01:32:15.976 --> 01:32:26.664]  Tex, before we go any further, give us some of your websites and tell us about your amazingly powerful newsletter and also your new book, Codex Magicka.
[01:32:27.885 --> 01:32:32.788]  Well Alex, I'll tell you, that book, wow, it's going to be a very controversial book.
[01:32:34.169 --> 01:32:41.034]  It's going to be out November 1st and I understand you're going to be offering it on your program on Infowars.com, your website.
[01:32:41.758 --> 01:32:45.240]  And I'll tell you, people will have never seen a book like this.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.241]  It's over 600 pages.
[01:32:47.861 --> 01:32:50.203]  It seems to be about two inches thick.
[01:32:50.263 --> 01:32:52.304]  It's really an encyclopedia.
[01:32:52.864 --> 01:33:00.688]  And it's the first book to ever expose, actually has over 1,000 pictures, photographs, illustrations.
[01:33:01.428 --> 01:33:05.651]  And it actually shows what I call the criminals of the Illuminati.
[01:33:06.211 --> 01:33:10.033]  Some of the top politicians, entertainers, bankers, financiers,
[01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:29.498]  Uh, secret society leaders in the world, as they do their secret hand signals, handshakes, even use their bodies, mysterious secret symbols, hidden codes, and all of this you're going to see in the book, and this is a book basically that I've been researching for well over a decade.
[01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:34.788]  And it's taken me almost five years to put it all together.
[01:33:34.928 --> 01:33:36.348]  Codex Magicka.
[01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:37.909]  Codex Magicka.
[01:33:37.949 --> 01:33:39.349]  This is your creme de la creme.
[01:33:39.849 --> 01:33:42.390]  This is your masterwork.
[01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:50.173]  This thing just proves without a shadow of a doubt, folks, page after page, document after document,
[01:33:50.951 --> 01:33:55.372]  It's overwhelming, and I mean, I remember years ago you were working on this book text.
[01:33:55.392 --> 01:34:01.474]  I mean, normally you'd write a book in a year, or even faster, and these were thick, well-researched, powerful books.
[01:34:01.494 --> 01:34:09.136]  I mean, the first book I ever heard the word RFID was your book, Project Lucid, back in 1996.
[01:34:09.576 --> 01:34:16.198]  I mean, no one had ever heard of it, and you have the documents, how it would be used to buy and sell, and how it would be used to track us,
[01:34:17.156 --> 01:34:22.962]  You know, now Katharine Aulberg is getting kudos for writing it, and good for her, but text is a real trailblazer.
[01:34:23.603 --> 01:34:29.029]  Texts describe why you took so long to write this, and why it ended up being so long.
[01:34:29.049 --> 01:34:31.591]  I mean, I'm the same way, but not as scholarly as you are.
[01:34:31.611 --> 01:34:35.235]  I mean, you just want to keep adding more and more documentation because there's so much.
[01:34:35.556 --> 01:34:36.797]  Why leave any of it out?
[01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:41.844]  Well, you know, I had to leave some of it out, but it's still in a large format.
[01:34:41.884 --> 01:34:44.806]  It's sort of like a coffee table type book.
[01:34:45.266 --> 01:34:46.187]  624 pages in all.
[01:34:46.507 --> 01:34:49.249]  Has a lot of footnotes and references, but mostly the pictures.
[01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:50.990]  And then I explain.
[01:34:51.410 --> 01:35:04.078]  And by the way, to make sure there's no argument, I go back and I actually have the pages out of some of the secret manuals and textbooks of the Illuminati secret societies.
[01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:06.402]  And the Masonic handbooks and stuff.
[01:35:06.442 --> 01:35:09.666]  So I show how they teach their initiates.
[01:35:10.107 --> 01:35:12.851]  For example, in Freemasonry, the first to the thirty-third degrees.
[01:35:13.352 --> 01:35:16.617]  How they use their different hand signals and all, and how they describe them.
[01:35:16.997 --> 01:35:18.159]  Then I actually show U.S.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.862]  Senators, Presidents,
[01:35:20.832 --> 01:35:30.559]  Prime Ministers, Federal Reserve Chairman and so forth, using the same symbols and how they do it, how they move their body, even the words they use.
[01:35:30.679 --> 01:35:32.040]  And listen to this, Alex.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:41.066]  You're going to see this on the cover of Time, Newsweek, all of the CBS, ABC, NBC sitcoms.
[01:35:41.727 --> 01:35:46.330]  There's even entertainers that have been brought into this and taught how to use their bodies.
[01:35:47.197 --> 01:35:53.201]  The sitcoms like Seinfeld, you'll see Jewish Kabbalistic hand signs used.
[01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.842]  The sign of Satan, El Diablo.
[01:35:56.402 --> 01:36:02.686]  And I will explain the difference between that in the book and just what the deaf do, the I love you of the deaf.
[01:36:03.006 --> 01:36:05.627]  There is a significant difference and people will see that.
[01:36:06.208 --> 01:36:10.050]  But all of those things are exposed, I believe, for the first time ever.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.542]  Uh, in this book, why did it take so long?
[01:36:12.782 --> 01:36:18.227]  You know, I think what is interesting, and I didn't even think about it until this moment, here you and I are talking about Halloween.
[01:36:18.807 --> 01:36:23.231]  It is the second most significant day in the Witchcraft calendar, Alex.
[01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:27.815]  I didn't realize my book is being released basically on Halloween day.
[01:36:28.946 --> 01:36:33.788]  Maybe God wants us to expose the occult and illuminate the occult.
[01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:36.409]  It was going to be out about a month ago, but it got held up.
[01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:38.370]  Yeah, it got held up by the printer.
[01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:47.875]  So now you're firing this major, scholarly, but also very interesting work at the enemy on their day.
[01:36:47.895 --> 01:36:51.816]  Of course, this is the eve of the day, and then tomorrow is when the book actually comes out.
[01:36:51.856 --> 01:36:55.158]  We put in our order now, folks, for a whole bunch of these.
[01:36:55.518 --> 01:36:57.059]  So I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com
[01:36:58.613 --> 01:37:07.497]  In order, Codex Magicka, 600 plus pages, over a thousand pictures, from InfoWars.com, or get it from Tex Mars.
[01:37:07.537 --> 01:37:14.520]  Tex, give us the phone number at your office, so folks can call and get the book, or call and get your free newsletter.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:24.605]  Well, I want to mention again, because a lot of people know about InfoWars.com, your website, it'll be available there, or they can go to our website, PowerOfProphecy.com,
[01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:29.191]  And, by the way, they can simply get our free newsletter.
[01:37:29.571 --> 01:37:34.053]  We'll be glad to give them this issue coming up which talks about Codex Magicka.
[01:37:34.073 --> 01:37:36.274]  They'll see some of the actual hand signs.
[01:37:36.555 --> 01:37:37.875]  We won't even charge them for that.
[01:37:38.255 --> 01:37:41.897]  Just ask for the free newsletter about Codex Magicka.
[01:37:41.917 --> 01:37:47.180]  Just call toll free 1-800-234-9673 and say, I'd like to know more about Codex Magicka.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.741]  Nobody will ask you to
[01:37:53.464 --> 01:37:55.065]  You know, to give a cent.
[01:37:55.085 --> 01:37:58.886]  We'll just take your name and address down and we'll send it right in the mail to you.
[01:37:59.266 --> 01:38:00.387]  No obligation whatsoever.
[01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:04.709]  And folks, it's a really nice newsletter with a lot of key information.
[01:38:05.049 --> 01:38:08.310]  In fact, when I did a newsletter for a while, I modeled it off of Texas.
[01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:09.330]  In fact, copied it, really.
[01:38:09.771 --> 01:38:12.532]  And then even used the same printer here in Austin because it's so nice.
[01:38:13.412 --> 01:38:15.593]  Tex, give that number out again twice, please.
[01:38:16.153 --> 01:38:23.397]  Well, you're very kind.
[01:38:23.417 --> 01:38:28.160]  1-800-TOLL-FREE 2-3-4-9-6-7-3 1-800-2-3-4-9-6-7-3 Of course, they can go ahead and order the book.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:32.142]  We're going to be getting it in this week, and we'll mail it right out.
[01:38:32.202 --> 01:38:36.144]  But I want to mention, as soon as we get it off the truck, we're going to bring over your boxes, too.
[01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.325]  I believe people will wake up.
[01:38:38.525 --> 01:38:43.868]  This will awaken thousands of people, because we're being conditioned
[01:38:44.716 --> 01:38:45.836]  We're being propagandized!
[01:38:45.936 --> 01:39:02.420]  I mean, Codex Magic doesn't wake up more than that because I have really, I told you earlier, I really wanted to make a documentary where I went through and showed it all, but there's so much to have it in this coffee table style book, such an easy read, so, you know, well illustrated, to have all of their own photos, their own admissions.
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.301]  This is how the elite communicates with each other.
[01:39:06.381 --> 01:39:10.982]  This is, I mean, really, these occult groups, folks, are like the original secret societies.
[01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:12.422]  They're really just
[01:39:13.454 --> 01:39:25.221]  ...intelligence agencies with these occult trappings and these occult beliefs involved so now people are going to have really the blueprint to understand a whole new language.
[01:39:25.281 --> 01:39:33.826]  It's like learning German or learning French or learning Spanish as in a text and you have kind of decoded the Rosetta Stone.
[01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:36.748]  Well, I believe that I have.
[01:39:37.288 --> 01:39:40.270]  And I've used, interestingly enough, their own textbooks.
[01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:41.430]  I've had to go all the way back to 1860
[01:39:43.483 --> 01:39:47.288]  Even the 1700s to find some of these textbooks.
[01:39:47.308 --> 01:39:56.939]  It's interesting how a lot of high level Freemasons have died over the years and their widows have sent me their libraries and their books.
[01:39:56.959 --> 01:40:02.525]  So this is how I came upon much of the material, literally from widows who were horrified
[01:40:03.024 --> 01:40:08.849]  When they went into their dead husbands libraries and such and found the textbooks and such.
[01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:10.931]  And by the way you mentioned Amun.
[01:40:12.112 --> 01:40:17.958]  One of the ladies, the widows actually sent me a book and showed where her husband had been worshipping the god Amun.
[01:40:18.458 --> 01:40:20.320]  Believing that he would gain prosperity.
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:27.221]  And you mentioned that the pagans and the witches were demonstrating against you and worshipping the God of Amun.
[01:40:27.401 --> 01:40:29.242]  You haven't seen the video yet!
[01:40:29.342 --> 01:40:34.903]  That's what the ritual is to give them prosperity and to take it away from George Bush.
[01:40:35.183 --> 01:40:41.885]  At the end of the ritual they say, give us prosperity and then they turn towards them and say, take it away from them.
[01:40:42.765 --> 01:40:43.625]  Take it away from them.
[01:40:44.125 --> 01:40:45.465]  You know, it's interesting now.
[01:40:45.485 --> 01:40:47.746]  A lot of people say, well, hand signs,
[01:40:48.436 --> 01:40:55.158]  Handshakes, secret gestures, the way things are set up in the movies and in magazine scenes.
[01:40:55.978 --> 01:40:57.559]  This is just clown stuff.
[01:40:57.579 --> 01:40:59.579]  This is just fun and games.
[01:40:59.699 --> 01:41:00.679]  This is not serious.
[01:41:00.699 --> 01:41:09.982]  But remember, John Wayne Gacy, who killed 28 young boys, this homosexual monster, loved to dress up as a clown.
[01:41:11.102 --> 01:41:16.384]  And he once told a police officer, quote, a clown can get away with murder.
[01:41:17.481 --> 01:41:22.463]  So, you know, it's like they're mocking, they're tormenting the masses.
[01:41:22.763 --> 01:41:26.745]  They believe we're so stupid, so profane... Well, it's like Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:27.085 --> 01:41:29.446]  Other people watch the ritual and they go, oh, it's just a play.
[01:41:29.746 --> 01:41:30.767]  They're just having fun.
[01:41:30.987 --> 01:41:33.528]  Folks, world leaders travel from around the world.
[01:41:33.908 --> 01:41:42.612]  Helmut Schmidt, in his own autobiography, German Chancellor, said, we do Druid rituals in Germany, but my favorite place to do them is in America.
[01:41:42.892 --> 01:41:44.533]  They take it very seriously.
[01:41:46.308 --> 01:41:46.888]  He did say that.
[01:41:46.908 --> 01:41:49.589]  In fact, it was in his biography, Men and Powers.
[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:51.530]  I recall reading that, Alex.
[01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:52.511]  You've got a great memory.
[01:41:53.111 --> 01:41:55.812]  But these people believe this.
[01:41:55.972 --> 01:42:05.676]  And by the way, when you study the history of the Illuminati, something like Halloween and what happens at Halloween is fun and games, but it's serious for them.
[01:42:06.336 --> 01:42:12.098]  You know, we look back and we see things like the guillotine during the French Revolution as hideous and gruesome.
[01:42:13.065 --> 01:42:14.926]  It's almost like a Halloween-ish thing.
[01:42:15.426 --> 01:42:20.649]  But these were live human beings, thousands, brought to the guillotine with their heads cut off.
[01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:22.410]  And why did it happen?
[01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:25.572]  Because of the Order of the Illuminati that was founded in 1776.
[01:42:27.293 --> 01:42:30.795]  By the way, its official founding date was May 1st.
[01:42:31.335 --> 01:42:36.738]  That's the Witches' Sabbat, their great high holy day, called Beltane.
[01:42:37.258 --> 01:42:38.419]  It's the worship of Bel.
[01:42:38.479 --> 01:42:40.840]  And there again, we go back to the Bible.
[01:42:41.943 --> 01:42:45.265]  The great fire god, Baal, was worshipped by the ancients.
[01:42:46.045 --> 01:42:50.127]  So all of these things, they bring back the ancient mystery religions.
[01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:56.191]  And that's why I believe the witches go and howl at the moon.
[01:42:56.291 --> 01:43:02.874]  By the way, in a book called Under the Sign of the Scorpion, which we offer at PowerProcess.com,
[01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:06.938]  Jerry Lena, who did tremendous research in this book.
[01:43:07.358 --> 01:43:08.578]  He's a man from Sweden.
[01:43:08.938 --> 01:43:11.859]  And I'm going to send you a copy of his book, Alex, if you don't have it.
[01:43:12.579 --> 01:43:19.121]  But he actually documents how Lenin, in his last days, his body was wrecked.
[01:43:19.161 --> 01:43:20.981]  He died of syphilis, believe it or not.
[01:43:21.041 --> 01:43:21.742]  Vladimir Lenin.
[01:43:22.602 --> 01:43:31.304]  But he would have his servants wheel him out to his balcony on the night of the full moon, and he would howl like a wolf.
[01:43:32.734 --> 01:43:39.057]  And here is the man who is still worshipped today by Marxists in America, many of the college professors.
[01:43:39.897 --> 01:43:41.498]  A howling at the moon.
[01:43:42.078 --> 01:43:45.260]  And of course, the witches worship the great moon goddess.
[01:43:45.831 --> 01:43:48.873]  And Ozzy Osbourne, oh yeah, bucket the moon.
[01:43:48.893 --> 01:43:54.276]  And then George Bush calls him in and goes, ah, blood and hell and death and destruction, we love Ozzy.
[01:43:54.656 --> 01:43:55.697]  It's all a big joke.
[01:43:55.737 --> 01:43:58.359]  Oh, and skull and bones, mock sacrifice, it's all a joke.
[01:43:58.819 --> 01:44:01.901]  But then in the real world, they're bombing innocent countries.
[01:44:01.921 --> 01:44:03.742]  They're running over people with bulldozers.
[01:44:04.002 --> 01:44:06.364]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:44:06.625 --> 01:44:08.246]  They're putting poison in the water.
[01:44:08.506 --> 01:44:11.029]  They're genetically engineering the food where it's toxic.
[01:44:11.289 --> 01:44:14.652]  They're doing all this evil, Tex, and we ask, why, why, why?
[01:44:15.132 --> 01:44:16.534]  It's a sacrifice, isn't it?
[01:44:17.715 --> 01:44:18.235]  It is.
[01:44:18.476 --> 01:44:19.216]  I am convinced.
[01:44:19.276 --> 01:44:21.919]  In fact, I did two hours of radio programs on this.
[01:44:21.939 --> 01:44:23.060]  Have the audio tapes now.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.881]  Of what happened at the World Trade Center.
[01:44:26.442 --> 01:44:29.704]  It was absolutely a satanic sacrifice there.
[01:44:30.104 --> 01:44:31.505]  Those two buildings coming down.
[01:44:32.025 --> 01:44:34.006]  Everything is done by these people, Alex.
[01:44:34.827 --> 01:44:37.268]  During either the new moon or the full moon.
[01:44:37.809 --> 01:44:40.030]  And many times occult astrology.
[01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:47.895]  Now that's not the astrology you read about in your newspaper when you want to know what, you know, for fun and games, the horoscope, the sun signs.
[01:44:48.295 --> 01:44:51.617]  There is a deep form of occult astrology.
[01:44:52.435 --> 01:44:56.899]  And they use this, and they use the witch's eight sabbaths each year.
[01:44:56.919 --> 01:45:00.001]  You know, all the way, they have a witch's calendar.
[01:45:00.622 --> 01:45:09.629]  And they frame all of their works around these days because they believe that this brings in, unleashes the powers from the spirit world.
[01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:11.251]  So they do.
[01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:18.597]  By the way, Robert Mueller, former Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations, all of its 32 directorates reported to him
[01:45:19.426 --> 01:45:23.328]  Now, there is a Secretary General, but this guy actually runs the U.N.
[01:45:23.368 --> 01:45:24.349]  on a day-to-day basis.
[01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:25.909]  He recently retired.
[01:45:25.989 --> 01:45:27.210]  He's like the city manager.
[01:45:27.630 --> 01:45:29.111]  Exactly, like a city manager.
[01:45:29.651 --> 01:45:35.094]  He admits in his book, I have a copy of a book by him called First Lady of the World.
[01:45:35.754 --> 01:45:38.916]  He says you've got to take a Luciferian initiation or you'll be killed.
[01:45:40.210 --> 01:45:47.555]  That's right, and he actually, remember, first lady of the world, the witches call their goddess the first lady.
[01:45:48.776 --> 01:45:50.017]  Sort of interesting.
[01:45:50.597 --> 01:45:52.078]  Our lady, the first lady.
[01:45:52.699 --> 01:46:01.705]  But Mueller says that the Rockefellers donated the money to buy the land on which the United Nations building sits.
[01:46:02.902 --> 01:46:06.145]  Okay, so we have the Rockefeller connection of the Illuminati.
[01:46:06.485 --> 01:46:16.432]  But then he says the reason that site was chosen there was because in decades past it had been used as a cattle slaughtering place.
[01:46:17.313 --> 01:46:21.897]  And he said thousands and thousands of cattle were brought there and slaughtered.
[01:46:21.917 --> 01:46:27.861]  He said the blood of these cows ran into the ground and made that a holy and sacred place.
[01:46:28.902 --> 01:46:31.524]  The sacrifice of the cows, their blood,
[01:46:32.003 --> 01:46:34.385]  Makes the United Nations a holy place!
[01:47:02.623 --> 01:47:05.125]  Their whole worlds revolve around this.
[01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:07.646]  They do indeed.
[01:47:08.127 --> 01:47:09.928]  You know, you mentioned the Order of Skull and Bones.
[01:47:09.988 --> 01:47:12.369]  Here again, do we not have a Halloween celebration?
[01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:14.490]  They dress up in costumes.
[01:47:14.530 --> 01:47:21.975]  They have bones, literally bones, I mean of human beings, in their tomb.
[01:47:22.563 --> 01:47:23.544]  Which is the name of their bill.
[01:47:23.584 --> 01:47:24.865]  You know, you've discussed this.
[01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:27.387]  We've talked about it together even on the radio.
[01:47:27.867 --> 01:47:30.770]  And on your website, there's articles about it.
[01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:35.554]  So this was a Halloween celebration, but they take it deadly serious.
[01:47:36.154 --> 01:47:38.536]  And I believe it carries on into their life.
[01:47:39.517 --> 01:47:42.900]  And the American people, it is so fantastic.
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.742]  You know, many people are so good.
[01:47:45.862 --> 01:47:46.923]  And they're gullible.
[01:47:46.963 --> 01:47:47.864]  They're sincere.
[01:47:48.785 --> 01:47:49.866]  They can't believe this.
[01:47:49.906 --> 01:47:51.307]  They can't believe it's possible.
[01:47:52.170 --> 01:48:01.177]  That a Bill Clinton or a George W. Bush, and notice we've got Democrats and Republicans there, or a Hillary Clinton or a Laura Bush could be involved in this.
[01:48:01.638 --> 01:48:03.499]  Well, it's also very, very scary.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:12.227]  Well, it is, because it totally destroys our concept of politics and government.
[01:48:14.348 --> 01:48:16.690]  I'll give you one example of this, Alex.
[01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:20.093]  I mentioned that Halloween was not celebrated in America until 1845.
[01:48:22.583 --> 01:48:25.565]  Here's something for your audience to get some meat onto.
[01:48:26.046 --> 01:48:37.454]  It was in 1845, I have it right here, the United States Congress passed the law which set the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November as Election Day.
[01:48:38.394 --> 01:48:40.496]  Now we have Election Day coming up this week, right?
[01:48:40.876 --> 01:48:41.156]  Yes.
[01:48:41.537 --> 01:48:43.478]  The first Tuesday after the first Monday.
[01:48:43.638 --> 01:48:44.599]  Why did they do that?
[01:48:45.219 --> 01:48:50.203]  Because this was a special day to the Druids and the witches
[01:48:52.793 --> 01:48:55.074]  Of which the Illuminati are patterned after their day.
[01:48:55.555 --> 01:48:57.056]  This was known as Slaughter Day.
[01:48:57.236 --> 01:48:59.437]  It was the day they slaughtered their cattle.
[01:49:00.097 --> 01:49:02.939]  Now they couldn't do it on a Monday because that was the Moon Day.
[01:49:02.999 --> 01:49:04.280]  That was the worship of the Goddess.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:06.161]  They had to do it on Tuesday.
[01:49:06.201 --> 01:49:08.202]  It was the first Tuesday then, you might say.
[01:49:08.542 --> 01:49:09.503]  After the first Monday.
[01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:10.924]  After what?
[01:49:11.604 --> 01:49:12.405]  After Halloween.
[01:49:12.625 --> 01:49:13.746]  Or, so Wayne Day.
[01:49:14.406 --> 01:49:15.907]  The day they worshipped the dead.
[01:49:17.326 --> 01:49:23.173]  They kill their cows, slaughter their animals for the coming winter season so they can store the food.
[01:49:23.993 --> 01:49:26.716]  And the blood flowed on that day.
[01:49:26.936 --> 01:49:28.478]  Election Day is Slaughter Day!
[01:49:29.799 --> 01:49:30.620]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:31.401]  Tex, stay there.
[01:49:31.421 --> 01:49:34.925]  We're going to come back and get a little bit into how they're replacing other
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.465]  Christian holidays with other pagan dates, like Christmas.
[01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:45.634]  And again, one more time, you've got to get the new book, Codex Magicka, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:49:45.974 --> 01:49:48.478]  Taking pre-orders, it's coming in this week, we'll ship it out to you.
[01:49:48.838 --> 01:49:52.163]  Or get it over there from TexMars, directly from the source, Power of Prophecy.
[01:49:53.385 --> 01:49:57.731]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.931 --> 01:50:02.377]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.498 --> 01:50:06.843]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.903 --> 01:50:08.285]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.047 --> 01:50:14.272]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.332 --> 01:50:21.280]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.423]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:34.191]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.391 --> 01:50:39.755]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:51:00.853 --> 01:51:11.766]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.006 --> 01:51:13.828]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:51:14.088 --> 01:51:17.410]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:51:17.751 --> 01:51:28.199]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:51:28.499 --> 01:51:28.999]  That's right!
[01:51:29.179 --> 01:51:36.301]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:53:02.743 --> 01:53:10.853]  620 something pages long, over a thousand pictures, secret signs, mysterious symbols, and the hidden codes of the Illuminati.
[01:53:11.534 --> 01:53:15.779]  And you know, so much stuff about the occult that I've researched, it's baloney.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:19.644]  And so many of these books about codes and the Bible and all this, more baloney.
[01:53:20.231 --> 01:53:21.012]  This is real.
[01:53:21.072 --> 01:53:33.560]  This is the dominant force in our world, our occultists, who think that we're a bunch of cattle, and they openly write about it in their memoirs, and countless widows get into their attics and find all this stuff.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:34.721]  Later, we end up getting it.
[01:53:35.201 --> 01:53:38.483]  Like Charlotte Isserby, you know, she was high-level Reagan administration.
[01:53:38.743 --> 01:53:44.147]  Her dad was skull and bones, bohemian grove, and had like a deathbed confession and accepted Jesus before he died.
[01:53:44.167 --> 01:53:45.528]  She was taking care of him when he had cancer.
[01:53:46.431 --> 01:53:57.480]  He had to listen to her every day doing talk radio interviews about what was happening with education and he finally woke up and he said, oh yeah, he cried about being a member and said it was horrible, that's all he'd say.
[01:53:58.701 --> 01:54:06.167]  But the point is, is that it's not too late for people to turn back, but most of them have already totally gone over to the other side, so I guess it may be too late.
[01:54:06.207 --> 01:54:07.548]  That's open for debate.
[01:54:08.266 --> 01:54:09.807]  But this is what's running things.
[01:54:09.847 --> 01:54:10.908]  You want to know the language?
[01:54:10.988 --> 01:54:12.329]  Believe me, I've studied it a lot.
[01:54:12.649 --> 01:54:14.871]  And to be able to see it on the cornerstones of buildings.
[01:54:14.931 --> 01:54:16.052]  Know what sect it is.
[01:54:16.472 --> 01:54:17.813]  Know what their specialties are.
[01:54:18.193 --> 01:54:20.875]  Know what they're doing when they're flashing hand signs on TV.
[01:54:21.516 --> 01:54:24.358]  When I'm debating somebody on TV and they're flashing hand signs.
[01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:25.699]  All this stuff.
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:29.181]  I told the story of my great-great-uncle, Uncle Houston.
[01:54:29.742 --> 01:54:30.682]  My dad's great-uncle.
[01:54:31.103 --> 01:54:35.306]  And he was a mason and he ran, during Prohibition, ran liquor stores.
[01:54:36.465 --> 01:54:37.666]  Underground, you know, speakeasies.
[01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:39.806]  In Houston, two guys tried to rob him.
[01:54:39.826 --> 01:54:40.347]  He killed them.
[01:54:41.287 --> 01:54:46.449]  And the point is, is that he went and flashed a Mason in Distress sign at the judge.
[01:54:46.489 --> 01:54:48.130]  The judge said, Case is Missed, instantly.
[01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:50.831]  And, you know, that can be abused.
[01:54:50.891 --> 01:54:51.691]  That is abuse.
[01:54:51.731 --> 01:54:53.352]  My Uncle Houston wasn't evil, folks.
[01:54:53.372 --> 01:54:54.952]  He was a mid-level Mason.
[01:54:55.853 --> 01:54:59.994]  But later in life, became high-level, and he told my daddy, don't join the Masons.
[01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:02.495]  Why?
[01:55:02.536 --> 01:55:03.696]  He wouldn't exactly tell him.
[01:55:04.736 --> 01:55:06.017]  But now we know.
[01:55:07.137 --> 01:55:10.099]  And look, it's so important to get Codex Magicka.
[01:55:10.139 --> 01:55:13.342]  Please go to Infowars.com or call toll free to get it.
[01:55:13.362 --> 01:55:14.502]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:15.383 --> 01:55:21.727]  Get this new book.
[01:55:21.747 --> 01:55:22.128]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:22.708 --> 01:55:30.053]  Or go over to ConspiracyWorld.com and link through to get the phone number or text right there on that site as well.
[01:55:30.894 --> 01:55:33.075]  Tex, we're about to break and come back and start the next hour.
[01:55:33.135 --> 01:55:36.338]  We will go to John and Mike and Larry and Gary and others.
[01:55:38.383 --> 01:55:57.610]  For the person that has trouble understanding, you know, why this occult system is out there, and who buys into the propaganda that Christians are a bunch of nuts who just want to persecute, you know, these sweet little pagans, I don't think a lot of people realize that the pagans have also posed as Christians to carry out their sacrifices.
[01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:58.290]  Haven't they?
[01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:01.551]  Well, of course, they would have to do that.
[01:56:02.391 --> 01:56:06.853]  You know, Satan would love nothing better than to pollute the real Christian church.
[01:56:07.458 --> 01:56:11.699]  But I think more and more today, we're becoming aware of these things, we're becoming alert.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:20.102]  And you know, I myself, when I was a young man growing up, I couldn't imagine anything, you know, being wrong with Halloween.
[01:56:20.122 --> 01:56:22.242]  It was a little frightening, a little bit scary.
[01:56:23.203 --> 01:56:27.384]  But I didn't know it was actually on a cult day, still in practice.
[01:56:28.044 --> 01:56:34.846]  You know, I recently read, and I know you have, the news headlines, this has been going on for several years, in Europe and Belgium.
[01:56:36.095 --> 01:56:49.158]  Now we find out that there's an entire network of politicians and judges throughout Europe that are tied with a child abduction, murder, snuff film production ring.
[01:56:49.998 --> 01:56:53.418]  We're talking about killing toddlers.
[01:56:53.958 --> 01:56:58.759]  Killing toddlers and this guy had been let go by judges and such.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:00.180]  These things are real.
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.600]  I believe it's happening in America.
[01:57:02.336 --> 01:57:03.517]  You know, just the mainstream.
[01:57:03.537 --> 01:57:12.340]  You know, Fred Barnes, who puts the Saturday Review, or the National Review, one of the conservative magazines, said something on TV recently.
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.582]  He said, in all the history of the United States, a free mason has never been convicted of murder.
[01:57:18.342 --> 01:57:21.884]  You mentioned that, how they favor each other, the judges and so forth.
[01:57:22.004 --> 01:57:22.944]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:57:23.344 --> 01:57:26.485]  Millions of masons, not one of them has ever gone to the death chair.
[01:57:26.705 --> 01:57:30.807]  Well, it is admitted that they let him go, then they found two more dead kids.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.183]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.223 --> 01:57:38.643]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.803 --> 01:57:39.424]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.584 --> 01:57:42.986]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.187 --> 01:57:47.349]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.649 --> 01:57:49.110]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.885 --> 01:58:01.710]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.071 --> 01:58:06.197]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.397 --> 01:58:11.283]  I tell ya, two hours he just blasted past us.
[01:58:12.469 --> 01:58:16.232]  We're going to be going to John and Larry and Gary and Alex there in just a few minutes.
[01:58:16.252 --> 01:58:18.433]  We're talking to Professor Tex Meyers, a good friend of mine.
[01:58:18.973 --> 01:58:21.355]  Pastor, best-selling author right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:58:21.855 --> 01:58:23.757]  Power of Prophecy is his ministry.
[01:58:24.077 --> 01:58:29.240]  We'll tell you about his websites and his toll-free number to get his amazing free newsletter before he leaves us.
[01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:30.921]  He's here talking about his new book.
[01:58:31.462 --> 01:58:32.583]  Comes out tomorrow.
[01:58:32.643 --> 01:58:33.743]  We're carrying it right now.
[01:58:33.763 --> 01:58:37.386]  I'm pre-ordering it, but it's coming in tomorrow or the next day.
[01:58:37.406 --> 01:58:38.206]  We'll be shipping it out.
[01:58:38.847 --> 01:58:40.568]  And that's Codex Magicka.
[01:58:41.582 --> 01:58:43.283]  An amazing new encyclopedic book.
[01:58:43.704 --> 01:58:50.069]  When we come back from this quick segment, in the next segment, I want to ask you about Hugo Chavez saying we don't practice Halloween.
[01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:52.291]  We're not satanic like the Americans.
[01:58:53.612 --> 01:58:56.534]  Because I know a lot of Latin Americans and they are scared to death of Halloween.
[01:58:56.894 --> 01:58:57.895]  Mexico's different though.
[01:58:57.915 --> 01:58:58.976]  They're a little more satanic.
[01:58:59.436 --> 01:59:00.898]  More like the Western culture.
[01:59:01.478 --> 01:59:04.761]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Mass.
[01:59:05.181 --> 01:59:06.602]  John, you're on the air with Tex Marsh.
[01:59:07.523 --> 01:59:08.063]  Hi Alex.
[01:59:08.163 --> 01:59:08.564]  Hi Tex.
[01:59:08.624 --> 01:59:09.965]  It's great to be on with you guys today.
[01:59:11.675 --> 01:59:18.799]  I just wanted to call because, number one, I live in Salem, Massachusetts, which I absolutely hate.
[01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:20.540]  First day of the year, live here.
[01:59:21.861 --> 01:59:28.145]  But what a lot of people don't understand is, a lot of people come up here, they're dressed in costumes, they go downtown, they hang out.
[01:59:28.772 --> 01:59:33.494]  But they don't understand that there's witches all over here that are practicing secret rituals.
[01:59:34.255 --> 01:59:36.916]  And it's one of those invite-only things.
[01:59:38.377 --> 01:59:39.998]  I mean, it really is incredible.
[01:59:40.058 --> 01:59:42.739]  It's going on right under everyone's nose, and they don't even get it.
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:46.801]  Well, we've studied it throughout history.
[01:59:46.821 --> 01:59:48.242]  You'll have the actual Satanist
[01:59:49.071 --> 01:59:51.673]  engaging in rituals and posing as Christians.
[01:59:52.454 --> 01:59:53.735]  Tex, you want to comment on this?
[01:59:54.515 --> 01:59:59.939]  Well, I think it is interesting up in Salem, Massachusetts, where I remember seeing pictures.
[01:59:59.979 --> 02:00:01.260]  I've never been to Massachusetts.
[02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:02.981]  I'm sure it's beautiful up in New England.
[02:00:03.582 --> 02:00:09.746]  But they actually have road signs, you know, inviting you into the land of the witches.
[02:00:09.826 --> 02:00:13.449]  And they have a picture of a witch riding a broom, supposedly.
[02:00:14.362 --> 02:00:36.338]  And I remember Governor Michael Dukakis, and I know John will remember this, he once had a little celebration, you might say, a little luncheon in his governor's mansion there, and he named one of the witches, I think it was Lori Cobbett or one of them, as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts official witch.
[02:00:37.198 --> 02:00:41.762]  And again, this is all supposed to be in great fun, but it's not so much fun.
[02:00:41.782 --> 02:00:43.483]  You know, I was recently reading a book
[02:00:44.273 --> 02:00:48.556]  Published in France, but now in English because it was so popular.
[02:00:49.516 --> 02:00:54.179]  It is entitled, Abortion as a Religious Sacrament.
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:02.584]  And the author of it says that abortion is a wonderful thing and witches and goddess advocates should support it.
[02:01:03.383 --> 02:01:07.306]  Because it is really the sacrifice of a live human being.
[02:01:07.346 --> 02:01:13.550]  Well, did you hear about coming in from Columbia, all of those dead babies inside the statues?
[02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:18.773]  It was hardly even in our news, it was in the BBC, being shipped in for rituals in Miami a month ago.
[02:01:19.273 --> 02:01:20.714]  Oh my goodness, Bill, I missed that.
[02:01:21.515 --> 02:01:23.256]  That is just incredible.
[02:01:23.296 --> 02:01:28.740]  Apparently it was in the BBC, showed photos of all these statues with dead babies in them, and they were going to gobble them.
[02:01:30.043 --> 02:01:35.708]  Wow, this is just... Well, it is grotesque, and it is real, and that's what I want to encourage people to understand.
[02:01:35.728 --> 02:01:37.649]  Well, how dare you say they're bad, eaten, dead babies, Jack?
[02:01:37.689 --> 02:01:40.892]  That's a friendly thing to do.
[02:01:40.932 --> 02:01:58.887]  Well, again, we get back to the ancient mystery of religions, and one of the things I show in Codex Magicka, whether it's Albert Pike, the former Sovereign Grand Commander of Freemasonry, all of the Satan worshippers and the leaders of the early Illuminati, all of them,
[02:01:59.771 --> 02:02:02.592]  ...believed, basically, in sacrifice.
[02:02:04.493 --> 02:02:13.558]  It's interesting that Pike, who actually used Indians during the Civil War to take the scalp of Yankee soldiers.
[02:02:13.578 --> 02:02:15.719]  He was a Civil War Confederate general.
[02:02:16.779 --> 02:02:21.681]  And it's interesting that his statue sits in front, or stands in front, of the U.S.
[02:02:21.721 --> 02:02:24.143]  Justice Department in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:25.775 --> 02:02:28.577]  Right down the street from the Supreme Court.
[02:02:28.937 --> 02:02:29.737]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:02:29.797 --> 02:02:34.219]  A Confederate war general statue stands in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:34.259 --> 02:02:36.260]  on public land in front of the Justice Department.
[02:02:36.721 --> 02:02:38.261]  Jesse Jackson doesn't seem to care.
[02:02:38.662 --> 02:02:43.004]  Well, Jesse is a 33rd degree mason as is Colin Powell.
[02:02:43.064 --> 02:02:43.624]  We got a break.
[02:02:43.744 --> 02:02:45.045]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:49.592]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.852 --> 02:02:51.433]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.773 --> 02:02:56.456]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.776 --> 02:03:01.198]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.639 --> 02:03:05.801]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.041 --> 02:03:08.884]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.964 --> 02:03:13.628]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.828 --> 02:03:18.253]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.493 --> 02:03:25.700]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:28.382]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:48.010 --> 02:03:52.513]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:52.853 --> 02:03:56.936]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:57.236 --> 02:03:57.796]  We listened.
[02:03:58.096 --> 02:04:03.079]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:03.840]  We listened.
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:07.262]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:07.682 --> 02:04:08.223]  We listened.
[02:04:08.683 --> 02:04:11.845]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:04:12.005 --> 02:04:12.385]  I don't know.
[02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:42.832]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:43.052 --> 02:04:45.734]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.454 --> 02:04:48.435]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:04:48.475 --> 02:04:51.377]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:04:51.557 --> 02:04:56.961]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:04:57.181 --> 02:04:58.702]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:04:58.742 --> 02:05:01.003]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:05:01.184 --> 02:05:04.666]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:05:05.046 --> 02:05:07.068]  And they can do it without due process.
[02:05:07.148 --> 02:05:14.074]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[02:05:14.254 --> 02:05:19.959]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[02:05:20.239 --> 02:05:27.705]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property or make it look like you own no property and a whole lot more.
[02:05:27.745 --> 02:05:31.609]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.937 --> 02:06:01.779]  President of Venezuela calls for ban on Halloween, BBC.
[02:06:01.799 --> 02:06:05.121]  He said, we don't dress our children up like witches.
[02:06:06.281 --> 02:06:07.162]  We're not like that.
[02:06:07.182 --> 02:06:08.723]  We're not here to terrorize our people.
[02:06:08.743 --> 02:06:09.703]  We're not Satanist.
[02:06:10.824 --> 02:06:14.906]  We're not here to put fear into our nation, putting fear into their own people.
[02:06:16.386 --> 02:06:21.609]  And there have been lanterns being put around the Capitol building with little threats in it as of late.
[02:06:22.606 --> 02:06:24.187]  A little threat to Chavez.
[02:06:24.227 --> 02:06:29.170]  Now I'm not here defending Chavez and his political views, but the point is that he's outside the New World Order.
[02:06:29.210 --> 02:06:30.591]  He's not playing ball with them.
[02:06:31.071 --> 02:06:32.292]  Clearly they hate his guts.
[02:06:32.852 --> 02:06:34.733]  Oh, a strange bedfellow here.
[02:06:35.514 --> 02:06:37.955]  Chavez agrees with us that it's really bad news.
[02:06:37.995 --> 02:06:42.698]  I'm not for banning it because it's free speech, folks, but we need to be honest.
[02:06:43.496 --> 02:06:48.658]  About this, and under the hate crime laws, I wouldn't be able to criticize this, and they're trying to get those passed.
[02:06:48.678 --> 02:06:49.478]  They have in England.
[02:06:49.998 --> 02:06:55.561]  I mean, how can they have the head of the Church of England, the Bishop of Canterbury, openly as a Druid?
[02:06:55.601 --> 02:07:01.563]  I have the video of him, and photos of him in the new film, in his Druid outfit with the big sword.
[02:07:02.063 --> 02:07:07.705]  And Julius Caesar, right there at that very spot 2,000 years ago, saw them eating the people they'd sacrificed.
[02:07:07.745 --> 02:07:08.565]  I mean, this is admitted.
[02:07:09.706 --> 02:07:12.667]  Tex, why do you think Chavez is out here saying this now?
[02:07:13.514 --> 02:07:25.406]  Well, of course, Chavez has been attacked, and even Pat Robertson, by the way, you're going to find that he is a high-level Freemason, and you'll see the actual hand signals that Pat Robertson uses in my book, Codex Magicka.
[02:07:25.806 --> 02:07:33.153]  So, Pat Robertson, the Seminary Club, is a tool of the elite, and they're all after Hugo Chavez, and you're absolutely right.
[02:07:33.234 --> 02:07:34.535]  He will not play ball.
[02:07:35.211 --> 02:07:36.892]  With the Illuminati elite.
[02:07:36.952 --> 02:07:37.812]  They hate the guy.
[02:07:38.133 --> 02:07:39.193]  He has a lot of oil.
[02:07:39.894 --> 02:07:41.935]  More than just about anybody in this hemisphere.
[02:07:42.815 --> 02:07:44.356]  And they're going to... Watch out.
[02:07:44.636 --> 02:07:47.518]  He will probably be a dead man before long.
[02:07:47.678 --> 02:07:49.659]  I hope he's got some good bodyguards.
[02:07:50.139 --> 02:07:54.522]  But now he's giving speeches about how he doesn't want his people worshipping the devil like us.
[02:07:55.242 --> 02:07:58.084]  Well, I think he knows what he's talking about there.
[02:07:58.664 --> 02:08:01.245]  We are the leading country on the occult.
[02:08:01.305 --> 02:08:02.086]  I mean, our movies.
[02:08:03.544 --> 02:08:13.148]  You just turn on the television and just look at the array of evil, occultic, satanic, slasher movies.
[02:08:13.649 --> 02:08:15.669]  Our kids are being programmed this way.
[02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:20.471]  And no wonder we're having things like what happened at Abu Ghraib Prison.
[02:08:21.112 --> 02:08:26.694]  Because these kids are being taught that there's nothing wrong with this hideous activity.
[02:08:26.914 --> 02:08:28.595]  Oh, it's going to get worse.
[02:08:29.855 --> 02:08:31.336]  Well, it probably will get worse.
[02:08:31.812 --> 02:08:36.216]  But it is interesting that Hugo Chavez is throwing this up to us right in our face.
[02:08:37.157 --> 02:08:41.581]  You know, the Bible says, and I don't mean to preach a sermon here, but it's very simple.
[02:08:41.601 --> 02:08:43.763]  A simple rule of thumb.
[02:08:43.803 --> 02:08:46.245]  It says, overcome evil with good.
[02:08:47.366 --> 02:08:53.111]  That's what we're supposed to do as Christians, but what kind of example is it to send evil?
[02:08:53.591 --> 02:08:56.634]  To transmit evil throughout the world?
[02:08:57.202 --> 02:09:11.067]  With this holiday, and by the way, if we are, supposedly we were formed first as a Christian nation, and a lot of people say that's not true, but again, Halloween was not practiced among the people.
[02:09:11.107 --> 02:09:19.590]  It was brought over here by immigrants to the United States, and really began to get, in popular means, about 1845.
[02:09:20.150 --> 02:09:23.511]  So George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, they didn't know anything about Halloween.
[02:09:23.791 --> 02:09:25.812]  It would have been a grotesque thing for them.
[02:09:27.114 --> 02:09:33.362]  Well, let's be clear, even the Associated Press is on the history of Christmas, and I've had guests on and written books about that.
[02:09:34.283 --> 02:09:36.206]  Santa Claus, I think it was in 1820 or 1830 or so, they banned Christmas
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:10:06.694]  For a decade, because there were so many fires, so many murders, so many shootings in London, and everybody modeled that there were these groups of street thugs that would demand tricks or treats on Christmas as well, and they modeled after, and I've seen the old sketches of him from the period, he looks like Freddy Krueger, he's a criminal with gorilla arms, with striped stockings, and Santa Claus runs around basically stealing and murdering,
[02:10:07.414 --> 02:10:09.935]  And so now that's Coca-Cola, by the way.
[02:10:10.395 --> 02:10:11.915]  Santa, they made him popular in the 20s.
[02:10:11.975 --> 02:10:13.656]  He didn't even get popular in the 20s.
[02:10:14.156 --> 02:10:17.537]  Just one company, Coca-Cola, he's a friendly guy with a big beard.
[02:10:17.877 --> 02:10:19.098]  See, now that's Christmas.
[02:10:19.138 --> 02:10:27.600]  So they're even... Easter, Ishtar, the bunny rabbit, the eggs, you know, Playboy, sex, fertility folks, you know, the symbol Ishtar, the bunny.
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:29.641]  I mean, Tex, they're taking everything over.
[02:10:29.661 --> 02:10:30.481]  They are.
[02:10:30.521 --> 02:10:33.622]  Now, the first step is basically to pollute Christianity.
[02:10:34.102 --> 02:10:41.067]  To bring us these things, and they look good, they have tinsel on them, they look wonderful, they're gaily wrapped, all of these holidays.
[02:10:41.708 --> 02:10:48.492]  But eventually they will come back and admit it, and they will say, did you know that Christmas is really a pagan, satanic day?
[02:10:48.873 --> 02:10:55.397]  Did you know that the very word Santa, S-A-N-T-A, that word is an anagram for Satan?
[02:10:55.818 --> 02:10:57.499]  Just a little scrambling of the letters.
[02:10:57.904 --> 02:11:03.871]  They will actually admit what they have done to us, and people will go, oh, well that's okay.
[02:11:04.132 --> 02:11:05.333]  See, this is their plan.
[02:11:05.353 --> 02:11:10.239]  It is the way the satanic psychologists work.
[02:11:15.772 --> 02:11:26.081]  Yeah, you get Satan, and I can show you in the New Age of Cultic Literature, for example, published by the Lucis Trust, they call their god Samat, S-A-N-A-T.
[02:11:26.762 --> 02:11:30.105]  So here again, you see an anagram for Satan.
[02:11:30.726 --> 02:11:38.533]  The Masons, of course, worship a god they call Jabulan, and they call him the Great Architect.
[02:11:39.810 --> 02:11:40.551]  Of the universe.
[02:11:40.631 --> 02:11:46.356]  So, all of these shadowy names, of course, are synonyms when you really look into it.
[02:11:46.736 --> 02:11:57.325]  Because Jabilan means a combination of Yahweh, or Jehovah, Baal, and On, which is one of the names of the Egyptian god, Osiris.
[02:11:57.525 --> 02:11:59.287]  Tex, I want to jam a few final calls in here.
[02:11:59.307 --> 02:12:01.308]  I know you've got to go, and I'm going to move quick through these.
[02:12:01.749 --> 02:12:04.691]  But what is the New World Order's final master plan?
[02:12:05.192 --> 02:12:07.954]  If they had their way, what would things look like right now?
[02:12:09.164 --> 02:12:11.286]  Well, they're on their way to getting it.
[02:12:11.346 --> 02:12:16.329]  What they want is a utopia in which the elite philosophers, which they think is them.
[02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:25.075]  You can be as stupid as George Bush, but he believes he's a king philosopher, as you know, would have it back in Platonic, Plato-type literature.
[02:12:25.555 --> 02:12:38.244]  They want a utopia on Earth, which means the peasants, a feudalistic system, will be reinstituted, and the masses will be ruled over by this largely elite,
[02:12:38.983 --> 02:12:40.824]  And so that is the new world order.
[02:12:41.924 --> 02:12:48.447]  So they're going to use religion, economics, politics, all those areas to bring it to pass.
[02:12:48.487 --> 02:12:53.949]  And so they're working in every field, these custodians of what they call the plan.
[02:12:55.778 --> 02:12:56.559]  Absolutely.
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:00.943]  Give us the toll-free number to get the free newsletter and the new book, Codex Magicka.
[02:13:01.343 --> 02:13:03.905]  Sure, Codex Magicka, of course, on Infowars.com.
[02:13:04.926 --> 02:13:08.610]  But people can call us and get a free newsletter, and we'll tell them a little bit about it.
[02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:10.972]  Codex Magicka is the name of it.
[02:13:11.112 --> 02:13:12.753]  Ask for that particular newsletter.
[02:13:13.094 --> 02:13:13.954]  Call us toll-free, 1-800-234-8000.
[02:13:17.487 --> 02:13:21.010]  9673.
[02:13:17.547 --> 02:13:21.010]  Now, if they want the book, they can go ahead and order it.
[02:13:21.070 --> 02:13:28.076]  Just tell the lady, because she's not going to ask you, she's not going to try to sell you anything, who answers the phone there.
[02:13:28.217 --> 02:13:35.383]  But 1-800-234-9673 or, Alex, as you mentioned, it will be available on Infowars.com on the Internet.
[02:13:35.643 --> 02:13:36.264]  It is, right now.
[02:13:36.304 --> 02:13:40.268]  We just posted it today and so, same price as Texas Selling It For.
[02:13:40.288 --> 02:13:40.808]  I hope you get it.
[02:13:41.929 --> 02:13:43.491]  $35 because it's 600 plus pages.
[02:13:43.711 --> 02:13:44.672]  Weighs 2 pounds.
[02:13:44.692 --> 02:13:47.394]  And I hope you'll get it and support what Texas is doing.
[02:13:48.115 --> 02:13:49.737]  Let's jam calls in.
[02:13:49.757 --> 02:13:50.898]  I know you guys have been patient.
[02:13:50.938 --> 02:13:51.759]  I want to get to you.
[02:13:52.459 --> 02:13:54.661]  I guess next up here is Larry.
[02:13:55.582 --> 02:13:57.885]  Larry, you're calling us from Arizona, I believe.
[02:13:57.905 --> 02:13:58.345]  Go ahead.
[02:13:59.746 --> 02:14:00.267]  That's right, Alex.
[02:14:01.396 --> 02:14:05.800]  I had to call in when I heard that Tex was on your show, because I owe Tex a thanks.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:20.893]  Several years ago, I made a missionary journey over to the Philippines, and at that time, Tex was offering free materials for missionaries, and his office was kind enough to send me four cases of books, which I handed out in the Philippines, and the people there were very grateful.
[02:14:20.913 --> 02:14:23.775]  Yeah, Tex is one of the most gracious people I know.
[02:14:23.815 --> 02:14:24.596]  Very nice person.
[02:14:25.397 --> 02:14:29.080]  You're way too kind to me, but thank you very much, Alex and Larry.
[02:14:30.572 --> 02:14:33.336]  I'd like to ask you a question, if I can.
[02:14:33.356 --> 02:14:42.008]  One of your tape series that I got several years ago, and by the way, you were the first person that turned me on to all of this New World Order stuff back in the 90s.
[02:14:42.648 --> 02:14:43.850]  I also want to thank you for that.
[02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:46.714]  But what I wanted to ask you about was one tape series that you had about
[02:14:47.764 --> 02:14:52.908]  People that were ducking out of the Vietnam War and going into seminaries and they really didn't do it for the right reasons.
[02:14:52.928 --> 02:14:54.329]  Yeah, communist infiltrating.
[02:14:54.349 --> 02:14:55.049]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:55.469 --> 02:14:56.330]  I want to take a few more.
[02:14:56.350 --> 02:14:57.771]  Tex, comment on that?
[02:14:58.491 --> 02:15:01.373]  Well, there was, you know, a church of universal life.
[02:15:01.753 --> 02:15:04.375]  A fake church that came up during the Vietnam War.
[02:15:04.935 --> 02:15:09.018]  And I think 3 million guys became ministers of this fake church.
[02:15:10.027 --> 02:15:10.428]  I don't
[02:15:25.123 --> 02:15:34.651]  But just because they were draft dodgers, and now, hey, they're in their high 40s, 50s, 60s, and they're running the religious establishment.
[02:15:34.691 --> 02:15:35.692]  Larry is absolutely right.
[02:15:35.912 --> 02:15:38.194]  So be very careful who your pastor is.
[02:15:38.534 --> 02:15:39.194]  Exactly.
[02:15:39.935 --> 02:15:42.377]  Let's talk to Gary in Ohio.
[02:15:42.417 --> 02:15:43.218]  Gary, go ahead.
[02:15:43.238 --> 02:15:47.001]  First time I called you, I want to thank you for fighting the New World Order.
[02:15:47.521 --> 02:15:49.683]  I learned about 9-11 basically from you.
[02:15:49.703 --> 02:15:50.884]  I've been passing out your videos.
[02:15:51.611 --> 02:15:54.093]  And also the whole globalist control thing.
[02:15:54.413 --> 02:15:54.913]  Well thank you.
[02:15:55.114 --> 02:16:01.538]  I was least interested in the Bohemian Grove and the occult aspect of it until I saw Bohemian Grove and found out there's Syria.
[02:16:03.049 --> 02:16:05.490]  They do that, you know, serious black magic stuff.
[02:16:05.770 --> 02:16:13.593]  I want to say, for most people, I'm sorry, I come from more on the left, and for most people Halloween is just, you know, make-believe, goofy stuff.
[02:16:14.153 --> 02:16:28.797]  But as far as the globalists, I think that, you know, we're doing a great job of exposing them, but right now they own the army, they own the media, they can cut you off in a minute, they own the banking system, dollars, voting, they put pig genes in our tomatoes and our food.
[02:16:29.097 --> 02:16:30.798]  You know what they did with the water in Bolivia?
[02:16:31.417 --> 02:16:31.798]  We're good to go.
[02:16:49.381 --> 02:16:49.962]  Absolutely.
[02:16:50.262 --> 02:16:51.863]  The only thing I would add Alex is, you know,
[02:17:12.379 --> 02:17:20.146]  A lot of these organizations, I believe Sierra Club, environmental groups and such, they are actually controlled by the elite.
[02:17:20.686 --> 02:17:22.928]  They claim to be decentralized, but they're not.
[02:17:23.308 --> 02:17:24.769]  But we need to develop mechanisms.
[02:17:24.849 --> 02:17:27.351]  We need to develop a true decentralization.
[02:17:27.432 --> 02:17:27.852]  You're right.
[02:17:28.544 --> 02:17:30.685]  Tex, I really want to thank you for coming on with us, my friend.
[02:17:30.705 --> 02:17:32.026]  I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[02:17:32.546 --> 02:17:34.947]  Alex, great to be on with you and your wonderful audience again.
[02:17:34.987 --> 02:17:35.568]  God bless you.
[02:17:35.728 --> 02:17:36.268]  God bless you.
[02:17:36.288 --> 02:17:38.869]  We'll be right back to tell you about forced vaccination.
[02:17:38.949 --> 02:17:42.251]  Coming up, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:42.291 --> 02:17:43.652]  We're carrying Codex Magicka.
[02:17:43.692 --> 02:17:43.932]  Get it!
[02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:48.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:54.325]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:17:54.905 --> 02:17:55.406]  That's right.
[02:17:55.706 --> 02:17:58.008]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:17:59.409 --> 02:18:05.474]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:18:06.036 --> 02:18:13.720]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:18:14.161 --> 02:18:19.023]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:18:19.664 --> 02:18:22.666]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:25.447 --> 02:18:29.612]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[02:18:32.235 --> 02:18:32.555]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:32.836 --> 02:18:33.116]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:19:48.949 --> 02:19:50.249]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:53.412]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:56.494]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[02:20:25.854 --> 02:20:26.214]  Have you?
[02:20:26.774 --> 02:20:28.295]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:20:30.297 --> 02:20:31.778]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:20:36.929 --> 02:20:37.991]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[02:20:38.572 --> 02:20:39.734]  Or some have been forgotten?

[02:20:45.948 --> 02:20:52.836]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:52.976 --> 02:21:05.910]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:07.872]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:08.052 --> 02:21:11.516]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:21:11.797 --> 02:21:15.581]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:21:15.842 --> 02:21:20.808]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[02:21:35.706 --> 02:21:36.227]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[02:21:53.816 --> 02:21:59.319]  Well, we've got the president of the National Vaccine Information Center on with us.
[02:21:59.359 --> 02:22:01.420]  We'll talk to him in a moment, Barbaralee Fisher.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:08.743]  They passed the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act for Homeland Security, page 76, because they couldn't get the states to do it three years ago.
[02:22:08.783 --> 02:22:11.585]  They tried to order medical workers and police to take it.
[02:22:11.765 --> 02:22:14.146]  They wholesale refused 99 plus percent.
[02:22:15.506 --> 02:22:17.146]  According to the Associated Press and L.A.
[02:22:17.186 --> 02:22:19.687]  Times, showing that even the enforcers aren't stupid.
[02:22:20.227 --> 02:22:26.349]  On top, virologists and others came out and said that this thing will spread smallpox and is very toxic.
[02:22:27.229 --> 02:22:28.870]  Well, here's one London Telegraph.
[02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:30.870]  I see articles like this every day.
[02:22:31.151 --> 02:22:32.871]  Here's just one today because we've got this guest on.
[02:22:33.351 --> 02:22:35.952]  Flu jab may be fatal to some pensioners.
[02:22:37.293 --> 02:22:41.717]  They report that old folks going in to get the shots are dying.
[02:22:41.737 --> 02:22:45.820]  They're suffering internal bleeding and dying and something's in the vaccines.
[02:22:47.061 --> 02:22:50.944]  Folks, how many people do you know were never sick but took a flu jab and they go to the hospital?
[02:22:51.825 --> 02:22:57.409]  And in the last five years they admit the flu shots they've given you don't even cover the flu that's coming out this year.
[02:22:58.410 --> 02:22:59.891]  But you still line up like cattle.
[02:23:01.383 --> 02:23:12.147]  Massive studies, I mean medical studies, double-blind studies, decades-long studies show that the folks that take four or five or more flu shots who are older get Alzheimer's.
[02:23:12.187 --> 02:23:12.967]  Well, yeah, the mercury.
[02:23:12.988 --> 02:23:15.468]  What do you think it does to your brain, folks?
[02:23:15.629 --> 02:23:18.990]  Alzheimer's is the exact same thing as mercury poisoning in many cases.
[02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:21.731]  And it's been a scourge.
[02:23:22.251 --> 02:23:23.972]  Autism up several thousand percent.
[02:23:23.992 --> 02:23:25.852]  We've had medical doctors on to cover this.
[02:23:26.653 --> 02:23:27.993]  They haven't taken it out of the shots.
[02:23:28.013 --> 02:23:29.714]  They've actually increased it in most shots.
[02:23:30.350 --> 02:23:52.328]  But the MMR and flu, up to 250 times safe levels, that all said, that's admitted, that all said now they are trying to pass mechanisms to forcibly inject you, to federalize the states to do this, they're having drills all over the country in Walmart parking lots where they practice busing in the school kids for their forcible injection, they give them a jelly bean so when it really happens they don't have fear.
[02:23:53.183 --> 02:23:56.824]  Now this is really scary, and now they want to give them liability protection.
[02:23:56.844 --> 02:23:57.565]  Now here's the difference.
[02:23:58.145 --> 02:24:00.346]  I'm for liability protection of gun makers.
[02:24:01.586 --> 02:24:05.648]  Because if somebody goes and buys a Louisville Slugger and beats your brains out, it's not Louisville Slugger's fault.
[02:24:06.028 --> 02:24:09.149]  Or if somebody runs over you in a Ford pickup truck on purpose, it's not Ford's fault.
[02:24:09.889 --> 02:24:10.990]  It's the same thing with guns.
[02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:20.113]  But with these shots, they claim it's a medical thing, they claim it's a drug, they claim it's something that helps you, and it doesn't, and they knowingly do this, they need to be held accountable.
[02:24:20.782 --> 02:24:25.725]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but she's going to be with us for the balance of the broadcast until about 50 after.
[02:24:25.745 --> 02:24:27.547]  We'll try to jam a few calls in.
[02:24:28.027 --> 02:24:30.088]  And she is Barbara Lee Fisher.
[02:24:30.529 --> 02:24:32.350]  Barbara, we've got this new nightmare.
[02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:34.311]  It's passed the Senate and it's in the House.
[02:24:35.052 --> 02:24:35.812]  Tell us all about it.
[02:24:36.693 --> 02:24:41.116]  Yeah, it's the latest in federal legislation since September 11, 2001.
[02:24:44.654 --> 02:25:02.854]  That is trying to totally absolve the vaccine makers from all liability for vaccine injuries and deaths and also protect anyone who's connected with giving these vaccines, any public health officials, any physicians who give the vaccines for what happens after they give them.
[02:25:03.454 --> 02:25:15.260]  And it all started with the Homeland Security bill after 9-1-1 and the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act, which were going through the states, being passed through the states.
[02:25:16.001 --> 02:25:30.628]  And then we have Project BioShield 2004, and now we have this latest legislation that is trying to take away all liability for whenever the Secretary of Health and Human Services declares even an imminent
[02:25:30.984 --> 02:25:32.965]  And this is going to be forcible by the way, boys and girls!
[02:25:46.773 --> 02:25:53.198]  Yeah, I think that people really don't understand what they did with the Homeland Security bill.
[02:25:53.618 --> 02:26:03.305]  It was the most incredible reorganization of the checks and balances that we have had historically in power in this country.
[02:26:03.425 --> 02:26:04.306]  It tilts now.
[02:26:04.526 --> 02:26:06.107]  It's total federalization.
[02:26:06.167 --> 02:26:08.829]  It's a giant cloaking device for public martial law.
[02:26:09.209 --> 02:26:11.791]  Ron Paul and many others are now saying that.
[02:26:11.891 --> 02:26:14.413]  And certainly, that's where they started to talk about
[02:26:14.938 --> 02:26:23.463]  And where they gave the power to the Secretary of HHS to declare even an imminent public health emergency and use, quote, substance or substances on the people.
[02:26:24.564 --> 02:26:26.145]  You know, whatever, that's very broad.
[02:26:27.266 --> 02:26:41.775]  And then, of course, Project BioShield 2004 went further, and in fact, you know, there have been a number of military personnel who have been forced to take the Antrax vaccine, which is basically an experimental vaccine and has never been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:26:41.795 --> 02:26:43.536]  And that's illegal even with the military!
[02:26:44.396 --> 02:26:45.538]  But I guess not now.
[02:26:46.058 --> 02:27:00.812]  No, and there's been a court case in the federal district court here, and there was a judge that said to Donald Rumsfeld, you may not give these soldiers this experimental vaccine without informed consent because it's experimental, it's against the law.
[02:27:01.292 --> 02:27:12.460]  And what they did, what the Secretary of Defense did in conjunction with the Secretary of HHS is invoke Project BioShield and had an emergency use authorization issued that got around that federal court order.
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:17.244]  So you see, already we're seeing what's happened when we give too much power to the executive branch.
[02:27:18.424 --> 02:27:22.207]  And folks, I mean they're doing this on purpose to the troops.
[02:27:22.227 --> 02:27:24.709]  Understand this is bioweapons testing on our own people.
[02:27:26.111 --> 02:27:29.694]  Oh boy, trouble, the deformities, and all sorts of health problems.
[02:27:30.034 --> 02:27:30.814]  Everything's fine.
[02:27:31.635 --> 02:27:33.376]  Well, roll up your sleeves and get ready.
[02:27:33.456 --> 02:27:34.397]  We'll be right there.
[02:27:35.878 --> 02:27:36.799]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.259 --> 02:27:38.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.781 --> 02:27:42.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.965 --> 02:27:47.986]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[02:27:48.587 --> 02:27:49.988]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:27:50.888 --> 02:27:54.631]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve,
[02:27:55.342 --> 02:28:01.366]  I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[02:28:01.946 --> 02:28:04.468]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:28:05.368 --> 02:28:09.931]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:28:10.532 --> 02:28:15.253]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:28:15.773 --> 02:28:34.398]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:28:34.959 --> 02:28:39.740]  That's www.LibertyDollar.org or call toll-free
[02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.270]  888-421-6181
[02:28:45.194 --> 02:28:47.175]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:28:47.255 --> 02:28:57.961]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.342 --> 02:29:02.844]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:02.924 --> 02:29:14.271]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.851 --> 02:29:21.697]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.097 --> 02:29:24.239]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:29.704]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[02:29:30.004 --> 02:29:36.149]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-801-8000.
[02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:49.037]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:29:49.137 --> 02:29:54.200]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:29:54.420 --> 02:30:00.604]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:30:00.864 --> 02:30:06.527]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:30:06.767 --> 02:30:12.271]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:30:12.532 --> 02:30:16.375]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:30:16.395 --> 02:30:21.659]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:30:21.859 --> 02:30:22.039]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:22.059 --> 02:30:23.040]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[02:30:28.644 --> 02:30:32.847]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[02:30:33.048 --> 02:30:35.990]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:41.034]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[02:30:41.294 --> 02:30:43.676]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:30:51.122 --> 02:30:53.063]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.523 --> 02:30:56.286]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:02.768 --> 02:31:12.215]  Coming up on November 4th, right here in Texas, and they don't have the special fraud electronic voting machines in everywhere, but we still have a chance to defeat this.
[02:31:12.235 --> 02:31:14.817]  90 plus percent of Texans are against toll roads.
[02:31:15.457 --> 02:31:18.599]  You're going to see election fraud at work here when you watch.
[02:31:18.619 --> 02:31:23.082]  There's a good chance, though, magically, though, doesn't matter what all the polls show, you voted for the tolls.
[02:31:24.503 --> 02:31:25.944]  We've caught them red-handed many times.
[02:31:25.984 --> 02:31:28.686]  That's why in your town, you don't have these new machines in.
[02:31:28.726 --> 02:31:29.667]  You really got to vote.
[02:31:30.316 --> 02:31:32.598]  Vote no on Prop 1 and Prop 9.
[02:31:32.638 --> 02:31:37.121]  1 is the toll roads and 9 is trying to, so they can stay in office longer.
[02:31:37.862 --> 02:31:40.804]  Just vote no on 1 and 9 for our Texas audience.
[02:31:40.844 --> 02:31:43.946]  And no matter where you live in the country, they're coming at you with the toll roads.
[02:31:45.287 --> 02:31:49.190]  By the way, before school always opens, they tell you it's the law.
[02:31:49.210 --> 02:31:51.411]  You gotta go be vaccinated to go to school.
[02:31:51.451 --> 02:31:52.252]  There's no law.
[02:31:52.292 --> 02:31:53.112]  There's never been a law.
[02:31:53.753 --> 02:31:57.496]  But they're just lying and it's a big, big business.
[02:31:58.416 --> 02:31:58.857]  Just with this
[02:32:00.959 --> 02:32:02.739]  Flu scare they're doing with the bird flu.
[02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:05.280]  Look at what they've been able to do.
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:14.803]  They've been running around yelling and screaming about that and hyperventilating and it turns out Rumsfeld's company is going to make between four and seven million dollars with this pill.
[02:32:15.603 --> 02:32:20.124]  And then one of the other companies has got connections into the White House making the flu vaccine.
[02:32:20.726 --> 02:32:23.148]  Which they admit doesn't even cover this supposed flu.
[02:32:23.688 --> 02:32:30.713]  So it's just a huge payoff in the tens of millions of dollars each year to these guys and then we find out what's in these vaccines.
[02:32:31.814 --> 02:32:36.757]  We have the CDC documents from 2000 where they said we've brain damaged millions but we've got to cover this up.
[02:32:37.778 --> 02:32:39.139]  And it's by design, folks.
[02:32:39.839 --> 02:32:41.480]  So make no mistake, this is happening.
[02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:42.121]  This is coming.
[02:32:42.845 --> 02:32:47.629]  And they're really pushing to set the precedent to put in our bodies what they want, when they want.
[02:32:47.649 --> 02:32:50.872]  They're talking about engineering vaccines into vegetables now.
[02:32:50.912 --> 02:32:52.093]  They already have the technology.
[02:32:52.113 --> 02:32:53.514]  Pharmacological crops.
[02:32:54.035 --> 02:33:05.324]  They're setting this precedent, talking to the President, Barbara Lee Fisher, of the National Vaccine Organization that exposes all of this.
[02:33:05.364 --> 02:33:10.909]  And we're so honored to have her on with us today from the National Vaccine Information Center.
[02:33:11.981 --> 02:33:15.303]  Continuing with what we're facing, how do we beat this?
[02:33:15.343 --> 02:33:17.765]  Because they just keep coming back, coming back with this.
[02:33:17.805 --> 02:33:18.946]  How do we beat this, Barbara?
[02:33:19.166 --> 02:33:25.470]  Well, you know, I don't know how we're going to really be able to turn this, to stop this bill.
[02:33:26.291 --> 02:33:33.275]  We might be able to, people are going to have to contact their congresspersons and they're going to have to make their views known.
[02:33:33.395 --> 02:33:38.519]  I mean, that's about the only way we can because we're outgunned up there by the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:33:38.559 --> 02:33:40.520]  They have this incredible power and money
[02:33:41.299 --> 02:33:46.003]  And also medical organizations, which are also lobbying for this bill.
[02:33:46.404 --> 02:33:47.384]  Well, I mean, you said it.
[02:33:47.404 --> 02:33:49.446]  I want to make something clear here.
[02:33:49.846 --> 02:33:58.754]  Remember earlier this year, they passed the New Freedom Initiative, the Orwellian term, for forced psychological testing and drugging of all school-aged children?
[02:33:59.054 --> 02:34:00.935]  Forced testing for all, drugging of many.
[02:34:01.256 --> 02:34:04.158]  And the drug company's own internal documents said this was about money.
[02:34:04.178 --> 02:34:06.380]  We're going to be able to put half the kids on drugs now.
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:08.682]  I mean, literally, they just bought our politicians
[02:34:09.242 --> 02:34:12.224]  It's amazing because, of course, there's no liability attached.
[02:34:12.244 --> 02:34:14.405]  You talk about a stockholder's dream and a consumer's worst nightmare.
[02:34:14.425 --> 02:34:17.526]  I've always said that until the cop with the nurse and the syringe and the gun comes to your door,
[02:34:34.162 --> 02:34:38.524]  Americans are not going to wake up and realize the freedoms that we've given away.
[02:34:38.605 --> 02:34:45.548]  Now, one of the things is that public health laws, including those laws governing vaccination, have always been state laws.
[02:34:45.909 --> 02:34:46.249]  Why?
[02:34:46.509 --> 02:34:47.309]  Because in the U.S.
[02:34:47.369 --> 02:34:52.312]  Constitution, anything that was not defined as a federal activity defaulted to the state.
[02:34:52.412 --> 02:35:01.177]  So, you're right that there's no federal law compelling vaccination yet, but there are state laws in the different states
[02:35:01.837 --> 02:35:06.221]  However, there have been exemptions that so far they've allowed people to get.
[02:35:06.321 --> 02:35:08.583]  But this, this is a big step in knocking that out.
[02:35:09.864 --> 02:35:20.067]  It started with Homeland Security, and yes, the Homeland Security law was the first time that the feds started to intrude upon the state's rights in this area.
[02:35:20.327 --> 02:35:25.809]  And people say that, oh, they'll never, you know, Homeland Security doesn't affect me, Patriot Act doesn't affect me.
[02:35:26.069 --> 02:35:27.229]  Yes, it does, folks.
[02:35:27.989 --> 02:35:38.152]  It does, and what the bigger plan is, of course, is once they can get all liability removed from those who make vaccines and drugs, those who give them to you,
[02:35:39.173 --> 02:35:40.254]  Well, I'll just say this.
[02:35:40.274 --> 02:35:42.336]  That's why they gave us the Second Amendment.
[02:36:01.892 --> 02:36:08.817]  Yeah, and we also have the 7th Amendment, which is our right to a trial by jury, in front of a jury of our peers.
[02:36:09.458 --> 02:36:12.780]  This legislation totally destroys the 7th Amendment.
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:16.783]  Did you know that the former top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr.
[02:36:16.803 --> 02:36:21.407]  says the government may carry out terror attacks and set up martial law?
[02:36:21.687 --> 02:36:27.772]  Did you know Ron Paul said the government wants to use this vaccine system to declare martial law and get our guns?
[02:36:28.452 --> 02:36:35.759]  So many prominent people are now saying we are actually becoming a commie Nazi system.
[02:36:35.799 --> 02:36:41.524]  I mean, America really is going into a total dictatorship very soon.
[02:36:42.865 --> 02:36:53.855]  You know, I never thought I would feel that our country is in danger and that we have so eroded the fundamental principles of the Constitution when it comes to civil liberties.
[02:36:54.849 --> 02:37:03.856]  Our founders came here because they were fleeing from oppression by kings and queens.
[02:37:03.876 --> 02:37:10.261]  But that British oppression isn't a thimble compared to this washtub of evil we're now seeing.
[02:37:10.762 --> 02:37:17.607]  Certainly, if we cannot have control over what we put in our bodies and the bodies of our children, we can in no sense be free.
[02:37:18.557 --> 02:37:24.900]  In my opinion, it's a human right to determine what you're willing to risk your life for.
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:28.641]  Barbara, why don't you tell people what they found in the vaccines confirmed?
[02:37:28.721 --> 02:37:30.102]  I mean, everything you can imagine.
[02:37:30.622 --> 02:37:32.463]  Well, it is distressing.
[02:37:32.943 --> 02:37:37.565]  When you go and you do the research and you find out how vaccines are made and you find that
[02:37:37.905 --> 02:37:45.076]  You know they're using animal cell substrates like monkey kidney cells to make vaccines.
[02:37:45.136 --> 02:37:52.868]  We had a problem a lot of people don't realize that the polio vaccine both the killed and live polio was contaminated with a monkey virus that is now
[02:37:53.508 --> 02:37:58.611]  Uh, been associated with brain, bone, and lung cancers in both humans, I mean, in both children and adults.
[02:37:58.711 --> 02:38:09.358]  Conclusively proven due to the explosive growth rate of many rare cancers that are now quite common, SV40, but there are new viruses, new cancer viruses they're finding in vaccines.
[02:38:09.398 --> 02:38:09.798]  Go ahead.
[02:38:09.918 --> 02:38:17.243]  Well, yeah, there's, um, they want to raise the level, acceptable level of what they call adventitious agent contamination.
[02:38:17.263 --> 02:38:18.183]  Well, let's just say it.
[02:38:18.283 --> 02:38:20.665]  These bastards have been spreading cancer.
[02:38:20.745 --> 02:38:21.405]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:21.445 --> 02:38:22.206]  Yeah, you know, it's,
[02:38:22.806 --> 02:38:39.213]  I think that there's just been this sort of blind spot with Congress and with the public about vaccines because there's been this incredible promotion that the polio vaccine, the smallpox vaccine, and all these vaccines have saved humanity from infectious diseases.
[02:38:39.253 --> 02:38:41.874]  And now they're openly saying, hey, we're not going to clean them up.
[02:38:41.934 --> 02:38:43.915]  In fact, we're going to make them as dirty as we want.
[02:38:44.335 --> 02:38:47.896]  Well, unfortunately, with this liability protection, they can do whatever they want to.
[02:38:47.916 --> 02:38:49.197]  And the other thing about this bill,
[02:38:50.702 --> 02:38:59.611]  That Senate Bill 1873 is that they are setting up this entity that is going to keep secret from the people.
[02:38:59.671 --> 02:39:05.956]  You can't, under the Freedom of Information Act, get any information about the way these vaccines and drugs are made.
[02:39:05.976 --> 02:39:10.401]  Yeah, keeping science and reporting and all of this secret.
[02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:11.842]  A secret holocaust.
[02:39:12.302 --> 02:39:22.950]  Yeah, and so the problem is you'll never be able to go to court to prove, like with the tobacco companies, they were, you know, you need to be able to go into court and hold industries.
[02:39:23.170 --> 02:39:26.513]  Now Bush already gave Eli Lilly protection, but we got that stripped.
[02:39:27.265 --> 02:39:29.347]  In the Homeland Security bill, yes.
[02:39:29.887 --> 02:39:40.156]  We organized a call-in campaign, and a fax campaign, and we got the thimerosal rider that protected the makers of the thimerosal, the mercury preservatives and vaccines.
[02:39:40.496 --> 02:39:41.437]  That was knocked out.
[02:39:41.557 --> 02:39:42.778]  But see, they've come around.
[02:39:42.838 --> 02:39:47.541]  They waited, and now they're going to achieve what they did not achieve in Homeland Security.
[02:39:47.562 --> 02:39:51.365]  They're going to achieve with this piece of... And people wonder why you never hear this on the nightly news.
[02:39:51.645 --> 02:39:52.746]  Half the advertisers
[02:39:53.667 --> 02:40:00.554]  I've already said this just from watching TV, but I've seen reports, news reports, and industry publications on advertising expenditures.
[02:40:01.335 --> 02:40:08.117]  About half of, in your average newscast, right around half, of the ads are drug maker ads.
[02:40:08.657 --> 02:40:10.478]  And they all have their vaccine divisions.
[02:40:10.538 --> 02:40:15.040]  So literally, half the news budget is being paid for by the drug makers.
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:16.680]  They're buying up everything!
[02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:28.304]  Well just think, if you have a product that is mandated to be used by every single citizen born in this country... But the media won't expose it because half their money, half their profits are from the drug makers!
[02:40:28.884 --> 02:40:37.748]  I don't know what, you know, the only thing I can, what we need to do is, as citizens, we need to stand up and we need to get to our elected representatives.
[02:40:37.868 --> 02:40:42.530]  And if our elected representatives won't listen to what we say, we have to elect new representatives.
[02:40:42.770 --> 02:40:44.571]  Yeah, we've got to have recalls about this.
[02:40:45.351 --> 02:40:50.713]  Barbara continuing here, you know, trying to look at this big picture of what we're facing.
[02:40:52.765 --> 02:41:01.788]  People need to realize there are 200 vaccines in the research pipeline that are literally being developed to prevent every single infectious disease you can think of.
[02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:11.552]  And you know there's never been any research into whether preventing all illness in childhood and as adults is really good for us.
[02:41:11.812 --> 02:41:16.254]  I mean obviously we've had illness on this earth since man walked the earth.
[02:41:17.031 --> 02:41:25.836]  You know, there are some scientists and physicians who are thinking independently and saying maybe getting sick once in a while is not bad for you, but is actually good for you.
[02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:31.080]  Well, it's just like antibiotics has now given rise to superbugs that eat your skin.
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:39.385]  I know people who have been on antibiotics for 10 years, they're totally unhappy and they can't get off of them now because they don't have an immune system and now it isn't even working for them.
[02:41:39.425 --> 02:41:39.785]  But look,
[02:41:40.345 --> 02:41:40.946]  That's the thing.
[02:41:41.006 --> 02:41:44.409]  Right now, they try to push about 45 vaccines on your kids.
[02:41:45.029 --> 02:41:45.670]  10 years ago, it was 30.
[02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:47.671]  10 years before that, it was 15.
[02:41:48.132 --> 02:41:58.280]  They're now talking about making your child take hundreds of shots, literally on a daily basis, injectors filled with every toxin you can imagine.
[02:41:59.181 --> 02:42:00.122]  This is unbelievable.
[02:42:00.182 --> 02:42:02.323]  I mean, this is like a science fiction horror movie.
[02:42:02.504 --> 02:42:06.387]  Well, I'm afraid people are going to have to wake up and see that just because
[02:42:07.067 --> 02:42:11.449]  Smallpox vaccine eradicated smallpox and polio vaccine took polio out.
[02:42:11.669 --> 02:42:15.911]  Does it mean that we have to use a vaccine for literally every disease known to man?
[02:42:16.531 --> 02:42:21.734]  You know, they're not doing the proper scientific research that needs to be done to look at this issue.
[02:42:21.754 --> 02:42:25.515]  They're just going blindly down the road saying more is better.
[02:42:25.956 --> 02:42:28.317]  You know, that we can take an unlimited number of vaccines.
[02:42:28.377 --> 02:42:30.798]  I mean, it doesn't even make any sense logically.
[02:42:31.298 --> 02:42:37.085]  Well, they even admit that they have a vaccine to stop kids having earaches, but they admit that vaccine is very dangerous.
[02:42:37.405 --> 02:42:43.632]  They have the meningitis shot, but they admit that's a very dangerous shot and doesn't even protect you in all cases.
[02:42:43.652 --> 02:42:46.155]  They've got Hepatitis B vaccine.
[02:42:46.175 --> 02:42:51.441]  They're given to 12-hour-old infants in a newborn nursery, even though Hepatitis B is an adult disease.
[02:42:51.881 --> 02:42:56.105]  That is through having multiple sexual partners or being an IV drug user.
[02:42:56.405 --> 02:43:01.289]  They are creating a vaccine for every sexually transmitted disease that they want to target, including HIV.
[02:43:01.549 --> 02:43:02.670]  Did you hear about England?
[02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:03.411]  For teenagers.
[02:43:03.431 --> 02:43:04.312]  Did you hear about England?
[02:43:04.332 --> 02:43:05.213]  I'm sure you did.
[02:43:05.233 --> 02:43:17.303]  They also, barely, it was barely defeated, they wanted to pass a law to give every child in England an injection of a vaccine with a live virus that was actually going to attack
[02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:26.872]  key nerve centers in the brain to, quote, cure children so they would never use cocaine, heroin, nicotine, or any other opiate.
[02:43:27.132 --> 02:43:27.872]  Right.
[02:43:27.912 --> 02:43:34.174]  Folks, imagine a vaccine with a virus that actually creates a type of chemical lobotomy.
[02:43:34.394 --> 02:43:35.694]  That's a science fiction movie, folks.
[02:43:35.734 --> 02:43:36.655]  That's Brave New World.
[02:43:37.775 --> 02:43:38.235]  You're right.
[02:43:38.355 --> 02:43:41.516]  There's an anti-cocaine vaccine there.
[02:43:41.696 --> 02:43:42.416]  I'm telling you.
[02:43:42.436 --> 02:43:44.196]  But it actually attacks the brain.
[02:43:44.516 --> 02:43:46.697]  They have a science fiction movie out about that right now.
[02:43:47.674 --> 02:43:53.859]  Well, I just think we've given too much power to MDs and PhDs who choose to become scientists and physicians.
[02:43:54.119 --> 02:43:59.504]  Well, some cop tries to come to my door and ejected me with some kind of thing that attacks my brain.
[02:43:59.604 --> 02:44:01.626]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:44:02.086 --> 02:44:12.214]  Well, I think people just don't understand because so many of these laws are passed quietly and that's one of the reasons that our organization, and we've been doing this vaccine safety work for 23 years,
[02:44:13.194 --> 02:44:17.676]  Put out a press release and said, you know, people wake up, see what's happened.
[02:44:18.036 --> 02:44:19.457]  You need to take back your country.
[02:44:19.517 --> 02:44:22.118]  You need to take back your Constitution.
[02:44:22.818 --> 02:44:29.942]  And you can only do that by going and holding the elected officials accountable for the votes that they make.
[02:44:30.342 --> 02:44:34.844]  You need to monitor what your elected official at the state and federal level is doing.
[02:44:35.184 --> 02:44:36.184]  Find out what they're doing.
[02:44:36.204 --> 02:44:37.345]  Find out who gives the money.
[02:44:37.825 --> 02:44:43.210]  You can find that out by going on the internet and see who gives your elected official money.
[02:44:43.690 --> 02:44:47.974]  And then if you don't like what they're doing in Washington or in your state capitol, you need to vote them out.
[02:44:49.316 --> 02:44:50.276]  Get your own people involved.
[02:44:50.296 --> 02:44:54.620]  But I thought we fought the British so we could forcibly inject our children with hundreds of toxins.
[02:44:55.641 --> 02:44:58.504]  I'm sure that our founders are turning over in their graves.
[02:44:58.564 --> 02:45:00.205]  They wouldn't believe.
[02:45:00.225 --> 02:45:00.986]  They really wouldn't.
[02:45:01.346 --> 02:45:02.808]  Okay, well we know it passed the Senate.
[02:45:02.848 --> 02:45:03.989]  What's the House bill number?
[02:45:05.083 --> 02:45:09.707]  I don't actually, you know, I don't have the house bill number in front of me here, but they can go to our website.
[02:45:09.727 --> 02:45:10.748]  We'll be updating that.
[02:45:11.029 --> 02:45:14.652]  We have a portion on our website and we'll get that new house number in there.
[02:45:14.972 --> 02:45:17.354]  That's N-V-I-C dot O-R-G.
[02:45:17.515 --> 02:45:18.135]  That's correct.
[02:45:18.275 --> 02:45:19.496]  N-V-I-C dot O-R-G.
[02:45:19.516 --> 02:45:21.098]  I know I've been jumping in a lot, Barbara.
[02:45:21.158 --> 02:45:23.260]  It's just that it freaks me out.
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:23.820]  I know.
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:26.363]  I mean, when I'm reading London Telegraph articles that are
[02:45:27.717 --> 02:45:29.257]  That are reported like it's good.
[02:45:29.577 --> 02:45:30.318]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[02:45:30.398 --> 02:45:36.679]  It attacks the brain so that you can't have these receptors plugged in by the opiates or by the nicotine.
[02:45:36.779 --> 02:45:38.699]  But then I talked to a medical doctor.
[02:45:38.719 --> 02:45:51.022]  I already knew it, but I talked to a brain expert about it on air and he said, well, of course, this will plug up the receptor where you can't feel good when you score the touchdown or you do good at work or your wife has that first child.
[02:45:51.362 --> 02:45:51.542]  I mean,
[02:45:52.222 --> 02:45:59.624]  If they destroy the receptors in the brain for those pleasures, those drugs simply mimic natural receptor points.
[02:45:59.844 --> 02:46:01.404]  Yeah, it's Brave New World.
[02:46:02.285 --> 02:46:03.665]  I don't know if you've ever read it.
[02:46:03.785 --> 02:46:05.045]  Actually, it's Brave New World.
[02:46:05.105 --> 02:46:06.065]  Yes, yes.
[02:46:06.085 --> 02:46:08.986]  But it's very unsettling.
[02:46:09.446 --> 02:46:12.187]  And I think, again, people have got to be more aware.
[02:46:12.467 --> 02:46:20.329]  And they need to vote people into their state legislatures and into Congress to understand that we do not want pharma running our lives.
[02:46:20.874 --> 02:46:27.858]  We don't want public health officials and pharma with too much power and too much money telling us what to put in our bodies.
[02:46:28.158 --> 02:46:30.139]  Well, we've got to defeat the bill.
[02:46:30.279 --> 02:46:34.041]  Congress set to pass a law eliminating liability for vaccine and green.
[02:46:34.381 --> 02:46:37.883]  And we'll get that up on our website, the new House bill.
[02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:39.770]  Alright, it just went to the House.
[02:46:39.811 --> 02:46:40.451]  It was S-1873.
[02:46:40.551 --> 02:46:46.553]  It's passed the Senate Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act.
[02:46:46.573 --> 02:46:47.013]  That's right.
[02:46:47.193 --> 02:46:48.293]  And that'll be the name of the House.
[02:46:48.353 --> 02:46:52.415]  It just went for Bio and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act.
[02:46:53.015 --> 02:46:54.976]  And Barbara, I want to commend you for coming on, folks.
[02:46:54.996 --> 02:46:58.397]  You need to go to your website, NVIC.org.
[02:46:59.037 --> 02:47:01.558]  NVIC.org.
[02:47:02.098 --> 02:47:03.339]  And you better get involved.
[02:47:03.519 --> 02:47:04.599]  Barbara, thank you for coming on.
[02:47:04.799 --> 02:47:05.419]  Oh, thank you.
[02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:05.900]  Bye-bye.
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:06.360]  God bless.
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:06.760]  Take care.
[02:47:07.446 --> 02:47:09.126]  Folks, this isn't a joke, okay?
[02:47:09.807 --> 02:47:12.187]  Type in pharmacological crops.
[02:47:12.207 --> 02:47:13.027]  They're going to put it in the food.
[02:47:13.047 --> 02:47:15.368]  They already have it.
[02:47:15.668 --> 02:47:18.548]  They have developed vaccines that they're looking at in the U.S.
[02:47:18.609 --> 02:47:28.831]  and that they tried to pass a law last year in England, by law, to make you take a vaccine where the virus actually creates a plaque.
[02:47:29.871 --> 02:47:30.571]  A plaque.
[02:47:32.192 --> 02:47:34.052]  It actually goes in, tailored,
[02:47:34.688 --> 02:47:40.252]  And the virus plugs into your receptor sites and actually kills brain cells.
[02:47:40.353 --> 02:47:41.113]  I can't believe this.
[02:47:41.774 --> 02:47:45.156]  I mean, we're talking actual brain engineering.
[02:47:45.937 --> 02:47:51.541]  You want to know what all this technology and the $700 hammers that have been spent on in the Pentagon?
[02:47:51.781 --> 02:47:54.003]  You know it didn't really go into hammers.
[02:47:54.203 --> 02:48:00.068]  It is actual stuff where they give you a shot and man, you are that mindless, after that you're just like a zombie.
[02:48:00.754 --> 02:48:02.516]  And they're going to be coming by in their black masks.
[02:48:02.896 --> 02:48:04.257]  Laugh at me like you did about everything else.
[02:48:04.858 --> 02:48:10.603]  If we don't stop them in 10 years, they're going to be coming around even sooner in black masks with Rogue Leader 17.
[02:48:10.683 --> 02:48:11.023]  Go in!
[02:48:11.063 --> 02:48:11.404]  Move in!
[02:48:11.424 --> 02:48:11.844]  Move in!
[02:48:12.124 --> 02:48:12.885]  Take your shot now!
[02:48:12.925 --> 02:48:13.586]  You're with us now!
[02:48:13.766 --> 02:48:14.226]  Join us!
[02:48:14.286 --> 02:48:14.727]  Join us!
[02:48:14.767 --> 02:48:15.447]  Now you're with us!
[02:48:15.688 --> 02:48:16.108]  Yes!
[02:48:16.328 --> 02:48:16.708]  Yes!
[02:48:16.769 --> 02:48:17.509]  Now you're with us!
[02:48:17.749 --> 02:48:19.211]  Now you're with the world leader now!
[02:48:19.631 --> 02:48:23.395]  I mean, these people are psychopathic, occult sickos.
[02:48:23.875 --> 02:48:24.956]  Go read the London Telegraph.
[02:48:25.076 --> 02:48:26.037]  Go read the BBC.
[02:48:26.177 --> 02:48:30.661]  They almost passed a law to actually lobotomize every child in England.
[02:48:31.782 --> 02:48:32.803]  I'm not joking!
[02:48:32.863 --> 02:48:36.406]  We are just living in absolute insanity!
[02:48:37.588 --> 02:48:40.050]  Normal people respond to it like I am!
[02:48:42.381 --> 02:48:49.226]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:49.546 --> 02:48:50.927]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:51.107 --> 02:48:53.308]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:53.468 --> 02:48:55.550]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:55.810 --> 02:49:00.773]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:01.113 --> 02:49:05.156]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:05.376 --> 02:49:07.156]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:07.236 --> 02:49:17.878]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.018 --> 02:49:19.939]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:20.119 --> 02:49:23.999]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the info war.

[02:49:46.106 --> 02:49:51.551]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:51.831 --> 02:50:02.199]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:02.359 --> 02:50:06.703]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:06.883 --> 02:50:15.249]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:15.509 --> 02:50:21.874]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper and foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.
[02:50:21.994 --> 02:50:26.457]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:50:58.639 --> 02:50:59.040]  I think so.
[02:51:18.922 --> 02:51:19.322]  I think so.
[02:51:44.871 --> 02:51:53.659]  A few months ago, I saw a trailer for a science fiction movie where the government makes you take a shot of a virus that then makes you behave yourself.
[02:51:53.739 --> 02:51:57.542]  It goes in and eats your brain, eats certain... And of course, that's real!
[02:51:57.623 --> 02:52:00.645]  They're actually about to pass laws to make us take it!
[02:52:00.785 --> 02:52:03.328]  I mean, see, that's why I'm freaking out here, folks!
[02:52:03.548 --> 02:52:04.629]  It's so bad!
[02:52:05.279 --> 02:52:07.760]  I mean, the cops out there, they're going to brain damage your kids!
[02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:08.200]  I know!
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:10.780]  You'll just roll their sleeves up and let them hurt your children!
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:12.981]  Because you believe the system's so good!
[02:52:13.181 --> 02:52:14.341]  You're so brainwashed!
[02:52:14.361 --> 02:52:15.541]  You're so stupid!
[02:52:16.182 --> 02:52:19.182]  And you yuppies out there, and all of you, you make me sick!
[02:52:20.002 --> 02:52:22.203]  And in the movie Serenity, you know, that's the message.
[02:52:22.223 --> 02:52:26.824]  The government's really secretly, you know, trying to make people sedative.
[02:52:27.164 --> 02:52:31.905]  I haven't seen the movie Equilibrium, but John Harmon, running the show, keeps telling me to see it.
[02:52:32.225 --> 02:52:33.926]  John, what does Equilibrium talk about?
[02:52:33.946 --> 02:52:34.806]  I'm going to take a few calls.
[02:52:35.464 --> 02:52:50.729]  Yeah, basically, um, everyone's forced to take this drug that... Emotions are banned in the future because emotions result in anger and violence and all that stuff, so everyone is turned into mindless zombies.
[02:52:51.767 --> 02:52:53.489]  To ensure peace.
[02:52:54.029 --> 02:53:02.276]  Which Aldous Huxley said his brother was UN Secretary General of UNESCO, but he wrote it back in the 30s before the UN even existed.
[02:53:02.316 --> 02:53:07.180]  He said in a speech in 62 at Berkeley that I've aired here, no this is the real plan.
[02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:08.621]  I've worked with the global government.
[02:53:08.942 --> 02:53:10.283]  My book is about our plan.
[02:53:10.803 --> 02:53:13.707]  So you go, well why is what the book says what they're doing?
[02:53:13.847 --> 02:53:16.230]  Because it's an actual plan, people!
[02:53:16.671 --> 02:53:17.612]  Listen to me!
[02:53:18.073 --> 02:53:20.156]  Soylent Green is made out of people!
[02:53:20.356 --> 02:53:21.537]  It's that equivalent, okay?
[02:53:21.698 --> 02:53:22.519]  It's that level!
[02:53:23.163 --> 02:53:25.985]  They're so close to the troops and the injectors.
[02:53:26.386 --> 02:53:27.547]  And Ron Paul won't care anymore.
[02:53:27.607 --> 02:53:28.868]  Once they get him, he'll be on the news.
[02:53:29.088 --> 02:53:29.768]  Everything is fine.
[02:53:29.788 --> 02:53:30.649]  I've had my injection.
[02:53:30.709 --> 02:53:31.670]  I love the global leader.
[02:53:31.950 --> 02:53:33.691]  I mean, folks, this is not a joke.
[02:53:33.891 --> 02:53:36.453]  You realize we're in a science fiction horror movie.
[02:53:36.774 --> 02:53:38.955]  This is, all you can do is fight at that point.
[02:53:39.256 --> 02:53:48.463]  When these dumb, dumb, dumb cops come with stupid troops, who've all had their injections, and all are following orders now, they're all going to be feeling fine.
[02:53:50.603 --> 02:53:59.310]  Go to InfoWars.com, get the new book Codex Magica, get my film Martial Law, make a thousand copies, run around screening, wake everybody up, freak out, pull your hair out.
[02:53:59.610 --> 02:54:01.351]  That's the normal response to this stuff.
[02:54:02.152 --> 02:54:03.373]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:54:03.393 --> 02:54:09.237]  They're going to make a law to forcibly inject us in no liability with just all this garbage, and it's going to be incrementally done.
[02:54:09.257 --> 02:54:13.880]  Let's talk to Alex and Mast and Joseph and England's been holding for five million years.
[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:14.481]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:54:16.129 --> 02:54:16.469]  Quickly!
[02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:18.591]  Oh, hey, um, I'm from North Carolina.
[02:54:18.711 --> 02:54:20.412]  Was there an Alex from Alex?
[02:54:20.552 --> 02:54:21.113]  It doesn't matter.
[02:54:21.153 --> 02:54:21.813]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:22.033 --> 02:54:44.069]  Well, um, you know, for 15 years or so, I've been aware of, and incrementally, of various things you talk about on the show, and I've always thought that I've done a good job of finding out about it, trying to protect myself and my family, until I learned recently that I guess I'm a complete moron, because I've been poisoning myself for the last 25 years, and I've been doing it with dental amalgam.
[02:54:45.374 --> 02:54:52.179]  Well, let me tell you, Dental Amalgam is at 1.1 billionth as bad as these vaccines.
[02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:53.520]  Oh, okay.
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:54.941]  Well, I guess that's good.
[02:54:54.961 --> 02:55:09.811]  I'm having all of them out, you know, as soon as I can, but it's unsettling, though, to know that, like, for example, I looked online and I found the Material Data Safety Sheet for a product called Dispersaloid.
[02:55:10.663 --> 02:55:14.325]  And, you know, if you go to a regular dentist, he'll tell you that there's nothing wrong with amalgams.
[02:55:14.425 --> 02:55:15.466]  They can't possibly hurt you.
[02:55:15.506 --> 02:55:21.830]  But the datasheet says that the number of amalgam restorations for one patient should be kept to a minimum.
[02:55:22.310 --> 02:55:26.073]  Inhalation of mercury vapor by dental staff may be avoided by proper handling.
[02:55:26.313 --> 02:55:29.055]  Yeah, no, the actual literature says it's dangerous.
[02:55:29.075 --> 02:55:29.655]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:29.715 --> 02:55:30.596]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:55:30.916 --> 02:55:31.736]  Joseph in England.
[02:55:31.776 --> 02:55:32.517]  Go ahead, Joseph.
[02:55:34.588 --> 02:55:42.651]  Yeah, I was just going to say, Equilibrium is a good film, but if you want to see a film that really describes the New World Order, there's a good one with Ewan McGregor called The Island you've got to see.
[02:55:42.891 --> 02:55:43.611]  Oh, I saw that.
[02:55:43.651 --> 02:55:44.571]  Yeah, The Island's great.
[02:55:45.412 --> 02:55:48.873]  I'm just going to read a quick headline out of the UK Daily Mirror.
[02:55:49.053 --> 02:55:58.896]  Our envoy loses satellite phone, Iraqi rebels find it, run up a £500,000 bill calling al-Qaeda in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, if you can believe that.
[02:55:59.476 --> 02:56:00.196]  I never covered that.
[02:56:00.236 --> 02:56:01.777]  More proof al-Qaeda is MI6 CIA.
[02:56:03.678 --> 02:56:04.098]  Absolutely.
[02:56:04.278 --> 02:56:04.999]  You're absolutely right.
[02:56:05.039 --> 02:56:06.119]  It's in the stack.
[02:56:06.159 --> 02:56:06.800]  I didn't get to it.
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:08.221]  I'm sorry.
[02:56:09.001 --> 02:56:10.041]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:10.062 --> 02:56:11.002]  We'll talk more, okay?
[02:56:11.562 --> 02:56:12.003]  Okay, then.
[02:56:12.263 --> 02:56:16.705]  Joseph, and that goes for John, and everybody else, and Alex, and all of you.
[02:56:16.725 --> 02:56:17.546]  Just great callers.
[02:56:17.586 --> 02:56:18.486]  God bless you all.
