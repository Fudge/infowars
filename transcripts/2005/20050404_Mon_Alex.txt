[00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:06.470]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.191]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:09.993]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:13.136]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:35.783]  Hello, my friends!
[00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:40.043]  It's Monday, the 4th day of April, 2005.
[00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.864]  Already into the 4th month of 2005.
[00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:46.945]  This year will be over before we know it.
[00:00:48.865 --> 00:01:02.168]  Well, as you all obviously know, and we mentioned this on Friday, for the portion of the show I did live, Pope John Paul II died, they say, Saturday.
[00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:31.993]  Italian newspapers were saying that he died Friday night but they didn't want the pontiff to die I guess on April Fool's Day or wanted time to build up the suspense and give the faithful time to assemble and so they said that he died on Saturday or perhaps the news reports of Friday night were wrong they were saying that he had catastrophic heart failure
[00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:44.249]  Cardiovascular failure as well, Friday morning and Friday night the Italian papers were reporting, and we linked to them, and Italian TV as well, that he was dead.
[00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.072]  But then I would turn on the nightly news, and they would say that, oh, he's going to die for sure, he's in his last hours.
[00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:58.433]  Well, if he wasn't dead yet, how did they know he was going to die for sure?
[00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:03.395]  I don't know, and it really doesn't matter that much
[00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:07.136]  It's just that this is the kind of stuff we notice.
[00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:12.759]  It's like Yasser Arafat died three days before they said he was dead.
[00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:20.844]  It came out that he was dead, and then three days later they said, okay, he died today, and then later they admitted, okay, he really died three days ago.
[00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:22.585]  Why do they do that?
[00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:33.132]  I don't know, but it is interesting to have Terry Schievo Schindler, who was a devout Catholic, die, and then two days later, or two days
[00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.393]  After she died, Pope John Paul II gets a feeding tube.
[00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:42.896]  It's all interesting.
[00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:44.958]  And again, folks, I'm not a Catholic.
[00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:55.847]  I guess you could call me a Protestant, but the Protestant Church is so unbelievably New World ordered and corrupt that you could just call me a believer in Christ.
[00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.472]  I do not want to get into denominations and fighting
[00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:05.004]  And I certainly don't want to, but you're welcome to do whatever you want.
[00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:06.524]  It's free speech here on this show.
[00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:13.388]  Is tasteful to bash Pope John Paul II right after he dies?
[00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:17.310]  Well, I'm getting emails doing it, so I'm sure it's going to happen.
[00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:22.853]  And I'm getting emails lauding him and paying homage.
[00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:31.598]  And this weekend I thought a lot about this pope and what it means to have a new one coming.
[00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:36.558]  After the conclave that will start up in the next few weeks of the Cardinals.
[00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:40.879]  This Pope called for a New World Order.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.941]  But he also really did stand up against Communism actively.
[00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:54.364]  And George Bush Senior tried to get him to quote be the chaplain of the New World Order.
[00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:56.345]  I have the Associated Press article on that.
[00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:57.505]  He refused.
[00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:00.246]  He was against the war
[00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:24.694]  uh... in iraq and he was even against the first gulf war to some extent but again we get into the whole good cop bad cop debate well you're welcome to call in about pope john paul the second you're welcome to call about terry shivo you're welcome to call in about the national i d card expansion uh... that's held up in the senate right now we have a guest coming on the second hour this out of
[00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:31.328]  Cox News Service, draft may be needed in a year, military analyst warn.
[00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.874]  We have one of those analysts joining us, a military veteran and also a professor, well a lawyer.
[00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:43.697]  Hope calls for new world order, I've got that article I'll go over.
[00:04:44.457 --> 00:04:51.582]  And this story out of, by Helen Thomas, screened audiences fake news promote Bush agenda.
[00:04:51.602 --> 00:04:52.843]  We've got to talk about this some more.
[00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.911]  Montana's about to throw out the Patriot Act.
[00:04:56.571 --> 00:04:57.111]  We'll be back.
[00:04:57.132 --> 00:05:00.654]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:05.818]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:10.421]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:14.945]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:16.326]  A New World Order.
[00:05:18.108 --> 00:05:22.352]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.392 --> 00:05:29.340]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.483]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:42.289]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.852]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.135]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:07.356]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:08.336]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:11.299]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.363]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:17.704]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:17.864 --> 00:07:20.726]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:24.830]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:25.150]  Look.
[00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.572]  The creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:32.557]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:35.960]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.485]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:42.346]  Try No-B-O.
[00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:44.448]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:46.510]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little
[00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.850]  Big Brother.
[00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.670]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.531]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:50.371]  You want answers?
[00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:51.092]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.333]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.853 --> 00:08:21.997]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:28.762]  Alright folks, fourth day of April 2005.
[00:08:29.163 --> 00:08:30.464]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:31.785]  It's not about left or right.
[00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:33.606]  It's about right and wrong.
[00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:40.892]  It's about exposing this global government that is forming all around us and the police state that it's setting up.
[00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:46.245]  Draft may be needed in a year, military analysts warn.
[00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:50.546]  This out of the Arizona Republic, a report from Cox News Service.
[00:08:51.407 --> 00:08:59.570]  If American forces aren't pulling out of Iraq in a year, a draft will be needed to meet manpower requirements, military analysts warned Wednesday.
[00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.952]  There's a whole bunch of different military analysts and experts saying this.
[00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:12.255]  The Pentagon's been saying this for years, to fight a multi-front war, they're going to need a national draft, but
[00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:30.389]  As they set up the draft boards, as they energize and massively increase the funding for the draft boards and for the Selective Service, the media tells you it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:30.849 --> 00:09:38.033]  It doesn't exist, even as 12 different bills have been introduced in the House and Senate in the last three years.
[00:09:39.394 --> 00:09:42.636]  We have a guest coming up who thinks we need to have a draft.
[00:09:43.357 --> 00:09:47.679]  As one of these analysts quoted in this news article in the next hour.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.940]  I do want to get into the Pope.
[00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:54.162]  Was he New World Order or was he Anti-New World Order?
[00:09:54.222 --> 00:10:10.991]  Well, I've got his quotes here where he called for a world religion and said that religions were basically all the same and I have his quotes where he called for a New World Order but at the same time I have it where he came out against wars
[00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:24.628]  And he came out against the Communists in Latin America, came out against the Russians, stood in the square, and basically backed off the Russian tanks in Poland.
[00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:31.854]  And Bush Sr., many years ago, asked him to be, quote, the chaplain of the New World Order, which he refused to do.
[00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:37.218]  So what New World Order is, or was, Pope John Paul II talking about?
[00:10:37.258 --> 00:10:41.702]  Again, I'm not a Catholic, folks, and I'm not going to sit here and defend Pope John Paul II.
[00:10:42.997 --> 00:11:08.284]  Any more than I'm going to defend the head of the 700 Club when he comes out and flashes the Lion's Paw on the cover of Time Magazine, a high-level Masonic signet or communique, or when Mr. Roberts comes out and says that abortion is what China has to do with its, quote, aggressive Planned Parenthood.
[00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:10.385]  I mean, we have to talk about this.
[00:11:11.693 --> 00:11:18.055]  We have to talk about how the leaders of almost every major organization are out there pushing and promoting the New World Order.
[00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:22.497]  Now, I don't think that the Catholic Church is the head of the New World Order.
[00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:24.817]  And I've said that many, many times.
[00:11:24.877 --> 00:11:27.718]  I think there's a lot of really good Catholic folks out there.
[00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:30.139]  900 to a billion Catholics.
[00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:32.580]  Some say even more than a billion.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.641]  And I know the Pope is against abortion and argued against it all over the planet.
[00:11:38.122 --> 00:11:39.242]  And argued against the UN.
[00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:50.114]  I know that Pope John Paul II was for Terri Schiavo and against killing her as they did last Thursday.
[00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:59.461]  But at the same time, we need to be able to, or last Wednesday, excuse me, is when they killed her.
[00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.943]  Thirteen and a half days into her torture.
[00:12:02.784 --> 00:12:08.308]  At the same time though, I mean, I do have the Pope in India getting the
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.922]  The Hindu blessing on him.
[00:12:13.302 --> 00:12:20.947]  Of course, we have Bush going to Shinto shrines and clapping and conjuring the demon of the shrine and praying to Allah.
[00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:27.791]  I just thought you might want to know that the Bible says, there shall be no gods before me.
[00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:30.532]  And this is not a religious program.
[00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:31.393]  I am Christian.
[00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:41.280]  I know the New World Order is Luciferian, and hates true Christians, and so in that news context, we cover this issue.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.041]  This is a news broadcast, though.
[00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:52.983]  But we do not censor you, atheists, Christians, Buddhists, in some cases, Satanists of cult.
[00:12:53.971 --> 00:13:03.173]  If you want to talk about your views, we have free speech here on the air.
[00:13:03.193 --> 00:13:03.853]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:05.693 --> 00:13:07.353]  And Helen Thomas has done it again.
[00:13:07.393 --> 00:13:16.875]  She's written an excellent, detailed article that was carried by the New Orleans News Channel of all places.
[00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:22.016]  Screened audiences fake news promote Bush agenda.
[00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:48.424]  And I know we've talked a lot about this, long before it was even in the mainstream media, that thousands of members of the press are paid thousands of dollars a month, in some cases millions of dollars a year, on average hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, to actually get faxes, they do it by fax because that's more secure, of their talking points on a weekly basis by the White House.
[00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.885]  Now they have congressional hearings in the 60s and 70s on this,
[00:13:53.544 --> 00:14:07.696]  It came out that hundreds of prominent editors of major newspapers were CIA officers with top-level security clearances, being given talking points as well, planting disinformation, you name it.
[00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:12.800]  But now, they're normalizing it.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.945]  Bush says, yeah, I spent 240 mil on one set of fake newscasts, and we're going to do more of it.
[00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.246]  What are you going to do?
[00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:26.110]  I'm not talking about the public service announcements where if you smoke marijuana, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.070]  Those are bad enough propaganda.
[00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:39.253]  Or the billboards all over the country that say, report illegal guns, that Bush has expanded his funding for, when that gun isn't even illegal in that area, creating the perception that it is illegal.
[00:14:39.793 --> 00:14:41.413]  That's good old-fashioned propaganda.
[00:14:41.953 --> 00:14:46.534]  This propaganda placement, though, paying for it, paying for the scripts,
[00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:52.790]  Shows like CSI with Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the fake Private Lynch rescue.
[00:14:54.631 --> 00:14:57.852]  Threat Matrix 24, where they torture people every episode.
[00:14:58.313 --> 00:15:01.414]  The government, the Pentagon, are involved!
[00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:06.536]  So, you're not watching liberal propaganda, you're not watching conservative propaganda.
[00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:08.617]  See, they know you're sophisticated.
[00:15:09.915 --> 00:15:13.936]  And you're going to wake up to propaganda, but then you're going to think, oh, it's liberal propaganda.
[00:15:13.976 --> 00:15:15.576]  It's conservative propaganda.
[00:15:15.796 --> 00:15:18.437]  That's only one layer, the outer layer of the onion.
[00:15:18.457 --> 00:15:18.737]  No, no.
[00:15:19.317 --> 00:15:21.517]  It goes much, much deeper.
[00:15:23.438 --> 00:15:25.798]  Right down to the scripts and the dramas.
[00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:26.739]  Not just the news.
[00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.959]  Not just in the North, South, East, and West.
[00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:31.660]  That's where news comes from.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:38.341]  That term, these bolts and boards that hang up at the telegraph stations 130 years ago in this country.
[00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:57.647]  Not just what you call real news, but the real propaganda, the most powerful propaganda, the most effective propaganda and brainwashing is in the sitcoms, the dramas, the cop shows, the CIA shows, the military shows, the video games, and folks, it's everywhere.
[00:15:59.082 --> 00:16:02.564]  You know, I just spent the last six months, five months, working on Martial Law.
[00:16:02.604 --> 00:16:05.305]  So I've been taking off, not working as much on the weekend.
[00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:06.285]  I spend time with the family.
[00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:11.167]  So at night, I, you know, sit there in bed and turn the TV on and watch a few hours of TV.
[00:16:11.507 --> 00:16:13.668]  Something I hadn't done in years.
[00:16:14.209 --> 00:16:17.090]  You know, I'm talking watch large segments of TV.
[00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.970]  I hadn't done that in years.
[00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.331]  And it's far worse than it used to be.
[00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:23.853]  I mean, it is just wild, the stuff I saw.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.202]  I saw torture every night flipping around the channels.
[00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:29.863]  I saw propaganda.
[00:16:29.983 --> 00:16:30.963]  Endless brainwashing.
[00:16:32.064 --> 00:16:37.027]  But why this is so important is they've been caught doing it and they're just going, yes, so what?
[00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:38.048]  This is the way it is now.
[00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:43.752]  But it isn't just they're paying for the specific shows to be full of brainwashing.
[00:16:44.252 --> 00:16:48.495]  To change our psychological makeup and our morals.
[00:16:49.055 --> 00:16:51.677]  To make us more malleable and pliable.
[00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:56.440]  And more easily shaped into these little cookie cutter slaves they want.
[00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:08.530]  What was so scary is that with this money they also, it's an understood deal, they're paying off the news to not cover certain issues.
[00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.392]  That's also part of the payoff.
[00:17:12.013 --> 00:17:13.855]  Because they're paying top dollars for these.
[00:17:15.176 --> 00:17:15.776]  Top dollar.
[00:17:16.717 --> 00:17:17.358]  You're supposed to
[00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:21.850]  For government funded stuff, you're supposed to get half price.
[00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.511]  There's even federal laws on that, which I think is a bad federal law.
[00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:30.613]  Oh, we get double, you know, double our money if it's government money.
[00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:35.914]  But you notice this is ignored in these propaganda placement type reports.
[00:17:36.015 --> 00:17:37.975]  So, I want to go over this Helen Thomas article.
[00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:38.635]  I put some calls.
[00:17:38.995 --> 00:17:46.578]  Some good news, Montana legislature, this will be what, six states if they pass it, to issue strong rebuke of Patriot Act.
[00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:52.180]  So the last couple are New Hampshire, Montana, if Montana passes this.
[00:17:53.561 --> 00:17:54.943]  That's a very conservative state.
[00:17:55.423 --> 00:17:57.246]  Arguably the most conservative in the Union.
[00:17:59.028 --> 00:18:03.213]  Fake Terry Schiavo autopsy photos circulate the internet.
[00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:07.198]  And what for most seasoned internet surfers, unfortunately, won't be a surprise.
[00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:13.133]  Death websites have been carrying photos of what they claim to be Harry Schiavo during her autopsy procedure.
[00:18:13.513 --> 00:18:23.517]  The photos actually show Lisa McPherson, a woman who died in 1995 from dehydration and starvation in a case many say has links to the occult church of Scientology.
[00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:33.461]  Continuing... Metal Storm on target with live fire demonstrations in the U.S.
[00:18:34.262 --> 00:18:35.722]  New attack robots.
[00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.283]  I want to go over this AP article.
[00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:40.047]  And this thing looks so evil.
[00:18:41.347 --> 00:18:46.269]  It's got four big machine guns, a little bitty robot, a hunter-killer robot.
[00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:54.773]  The problem with all this is they're going to phase out regular troops who still have some moral compass and go completely to robotic forces.
[00:18:55.653 --> 00:19:06.117]  Half of the ground forces, you heard me, and half of the air force forces, air-based forces, airborne forces I should say properly, are going to be robotic by 2010.
[00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:09.237]  Years away.
[00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:19.161]  And we will continue as well with Michael Schiavo, won't even allow Terry's parents to attend her funeral and is having it at a secret location.
[00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:21.662]  Wouldn't let them in in her last hours.
[00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:25.323]  As well, oh that shows what a nice guy he is, huh?
[00:19:26.323 --> 00:19:27.063]  And U.S.
[00:19:27.123 --> 00:19:30.825]  intelligence on Iraq was chaotic and incomplete, says Bush Commission.
[00:19:31.345 --> 00:19:34.746]  More reasons why Bush needs more power and control.
[00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:39.762]  So, they order the CIA to lie.
[00:19:39.882 --> 00:19:40.522]  That's public.
[00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:41.822]  And then they go, see?
[00:19:42.362 --> 00:19:43.503]  They're not doing a good job.
[00:19:43.543 --> 00:19:44.543]  We need more power.
[00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:46.763]  You talk about spin.
[00:19:46.803 --> 00:19:50.284]  These guys deserve the Joseph Goebbels Award.
[00:19:51.005 --> 00:19:53.465]  Senate opens door to alien amnesty.
[00:19:53.765 --> 00:19:55.246]  Total alien amnesty.
[00:19:56.586 --> 00:19:57.386]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.546 --> 00:19:59.687]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just one of the websites.
[00:19:59.727 --> 00:20:00.167]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.897 --> 00:20:03.379]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:08.244]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:08.584 --> 00:20:10.927]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:11.147 --> 00:20:12.688]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:18.154]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:22.459]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:47.875]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.

[00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:03.126]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.266 --> 00:21:07.348]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.508 --> 00:21:10.369]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:17.173]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.353 --> 00:21:20.375]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.575 --> 00:21:22.956]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:30.980]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:42.568]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:49.973]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:22:01.329 --> 00:22:03.831]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.472 --> 00:22:13.719]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:21.445]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:22:22.346 --> 00:22:23.767]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:24.007 --> 00:22:27.070]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:36.570]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.737 --> 00:23:06.259]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:14.022]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:20.744]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:23:20.944 --> 00:23:22.305]  Now it's available to you.
[00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:29.067]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:23:29.287 --> 00:23:33.569]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:40.133]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:44.335]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[00:23:59.182 --> 00:24:04.103]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:24:06.204 --> 00:24:06.804]  Good, sir.
[00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:13.526]  I wanted to tell you, I was talking to you last week about the concentration camps up in British Columbia, Canada.
[00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:33.344]  The Emergency Relocation Centers for your safety, sir.
[00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:45.751]  I'm actually planning a little trip, probably in the next month or two, up to one of them up in Fort Nelson, which is probably at the border of Yukon Territories and D.C.
[00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:52.795]  And I'm probably going to go with 10 people, and we're going to try to take some video and photography of the place.
[00:24:53.656 --> 00:24:58.759]  I understand the only way... Well, number one, I mean, how do you even know that this is an emergency relocation camp?
[00:24:59.443 --> 00:25:04.405]  Well, from what I've read on the internet, it's an actual, I don't know, concentration camp.
[00:25:04.746 --> 00:25:05.426]  Now, I can't prove it.
[00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:08.407]  Well, you've got to really watch stuff on the internet, I'm going to tell you right now.
[00:25:08.467 --> 00:25:09.628]  Well, I know, that's the thing.
[00:25:09.648 --> 00:25:10.909]  That's why I want to check it out.
[00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.990]  I'm only going to waste some gas going up there.
[00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.451]  Well, no, I think it's a good idea, but let me just give you a little bit of history on this.
[00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:19.133]  If you really want to know about camps and relocation centers,
[00:25:20.351 --> 00:25:22.554]  Uh... but my police state videos covered it.
[00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:29.624]  I mean, my book has the Army's official letter on it admitting where twelve of the camps are.
[00:25:30.505 --> 00:25:32.508]  I've been to emergency FEMA centers.
[00:25:32.648 --> 00:25:34.510]  I've got mainstream news articles
[00:25:36.112 --> 00:25:48.541]  Posted it on my website, but I noticed that all these other, not all, but 90% of the websites that expose camps, they're always putting out disinfo and just making stuff up, which I can't ever figure out.
[00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:50.403]  Why not talk about the real stuff?
[00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:56.687]  Well, I don't see a lot of harm in trying to... Oh no, I think it's good that you're going to check this out.
[00:25:57.788 --> 00:26:00.090]  But, you know, a lot of them, like from this one here,
[00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:02.671]  Actually, I think I sent you the link before.
[00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:04.014]  I'm not sure if you saw it.
[00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:07.442]  It's a whole bunch of American and Canadian...
[00:26:08.298 --> 00:26:08.659]  Camps.
[00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:18.065]  And basically, I mean it doesn't show you a road map how to get there, but... Well, they've said in England, they've said in the U.S., quote, if there's a big attack, they may have to put us in these emergency camps.
[00:26:18.146 --> 00:26:19.306]  And of course, disarm us.
[00:26:19.747 --> 00:26:21.428]  Can't have people with guns in the camps.
[00:26:21.488 --> 00:26:26.812]  And in Police State 2000, I had Marines training in 99 to put Americans in camps.
[00:26:27.572 --> 00:26:30.815]  They have role players, and they go, where'd you get the weapons?
[00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:31.535]  Where are you from?
[00:26:31.575 --> 00:26:32.676]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:26:33.277 --> 00:26:36.239]  You know, this is for domestic operations.
[00:26:36.997 --> 00:26:43.098]  Well, if I get some video and I see something that's of interest, I'll maybe send you a copy of the DVD.
[00:26:43.379 --> 00:26:44.359]  Thanks a million, Johnny.
[00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:45.079]  I really want that.
[00:26:45.159 --> 00:26:45.839]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:47.339]  No, no, I commend you.
[00:26:47.379 --> 00:26:50.300]  That's what you should do, is go check this stuff out.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:57.162]  I mean, General Tommy Franks, last year in Cigar Aficionado, comes out and says, well, there's another terror attack.
[00:26:57.202 --> 00:27:02.223]  We'll set aside the Constitution in favor of a military government and martial law.
[00:27:03.493 --> 00:27:04.054]  So, yeah.
[00:27:04.094 --> 00:27:04.454]  No, no, no.
[00:27:04.514 --> 00:27:07.456]  I mean, when you mention you're going to check a camp out, I think that's great.
[00:27:08.397 --> 00:27:13.221]  It's just that so many of these that you see on the internet are not camps.
[00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:17.384]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Tennessee.
[00:27:17.444 --> 00:27:18.265]  Gary, go ahead.
[00:27:18.525 --> 00:27:18.765]  Hey, Alex.
[00:27:18.785 --> 00:27:19.146]  How are you?
[00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:19.886]  I'm good.
[00:27:20.407 --> 00:27:21.788]  Oh, I've got a couple things I want to ask you about.
[00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:23.829]  I know I'm going to make a comment on something.
[00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.753]  One is the gun exchange program they've got going.
[00:27:30.074 --> 00:27:31.295]  I know she's on one of your websites.
[00:27:31.436 --> 00:27:33.057]  She's over in Philadelphia.
[00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:43.122]  Yeah, and quote, even conservative groups say, you don't need a semi-automatic, turn it in!
[00:27:43.242 --> 00:27:53.866]  Yep, that's a conservative group, and they have Baptist churches, Catholic churches, that I've seen that do gun buybacks and tell their parishioners, turn your guns in, guns are evil.
[00:27:54.366 --> 00:27:55.747]  I mean, this is the brainwashing.
[00:27:56.447 --> 00:27:59.128]  Well, they've got talk about that going on here in Tennessee before long too.
[00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:01.009]  Oh no, you've had gun buybacks there.
[00:28:01.189 --> 00:28:02.850]  You've had them in Knoxville.
[00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.111]  You've had them in Memphis.
[00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:04.671]  I've covered them.
[00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:09.073]  Yeah, but they're talking about having that again from what I understand.
[00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:09.814]  It's pathetic.
[00:28:09.874 --> 00:28:15.556]  It's all about training you to see news images of cops lined up and people turning guns in.
[00:28:17.497 --> 00:28:20.479]  What's the deal with Bill Clinton to run the U.N.?
[00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:21.299]  Have you heard about that?
[00:28:22.014 --> 00:28:22.455]  Certainly.
[00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:24.637]  In fact, we reposted that last week.
[00:28:25.338 --> 00:28:27.059]  Coffee Annan's own U.N.
[00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:29.622]  found him not guilty of nepotism.
[00:28:29.842 --> 00:28:34.507]  Of course, that's like George Bush appointing a 9-11 commission and calling it independent.
[00:28:34.887 --> 00:28:38.391]  And they find him perfectly innocent and let's give him more power.
[00:28:39.352 --> 00:28:41.254]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:28:42.335 --> 00:28:44.817]  And Bill Clinton has lined up seven of the G8
[00:28:46.384 --> 00:28:57.106]  This has been in major publications and he wants to be the new Secretary General of the United Nations and it looks like that that is the most probable outcome.
[00:28:58.206 --> 00:28:58.506]  Okay.
[00:28:58.646 --> 00:29:02.067]  There's talk of Annan leaving a year early next year.
[00:29:02.087 --> 00:29:03.447]  Alright.
[00:29:04.247 --> 00:29:06.147]  Now the other thing on that spot and I'll let you go.
[00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:15.909]  Here in my little town, little community, less than I guess 2,000 people, we've had a big quarrel here about a prison in a little county here.
[00:29:16.816 --> 00:29:19.538]  And so far we've been able to fight it off, everything.
[00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:22.499]  Is it a state or federal prison?
[00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:23.340]  It's a federal prison.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.981]  Well, there's your camps!
[00:29:25.121 --> 00:29:29.883]  I mean, we've gone from 1.3 million in prison ten years ago to 7 million in prison today.
[00:29:29.903 --> 00:29:30.664]  Right.
[00:29:30.704 --> 00:29:32.264]  So what's your question about the prison?
[00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:38.628]  Well, as much as you've covered them, does the name Michael Rackovich of Sand Associates mean anything?
[00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:45.788]  No, it doesn't ring a bell, but is it... What security level is it?
[00:29:45.808 --> 00:29:47.269]  I have no idea.
[00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:48.930]  Alright, thank you for the call, sir.
[00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:49.610]  Good to hear from you.
[00:29:51.771 --> 00:29:52.692]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.172 --> 00:29:54.793]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:58.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.405 --> 00:30:08.034]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregason, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:18.489]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregason, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[00:30:19.189 --> 00:30:20.670]  With a 100% kill.

[00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:03.130]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:13.916]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.297 --> 00:31:18.819]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:30.226]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:37.673]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.053 --> 00:31:40.195]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:45.660]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[00:33:06.292 --> 00:33:08.193]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.673 --> 00:33:11.514]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:22.318]  Defending liberty, resisting tyranny, 110% Monday through Friday from 11am until 2pm Central Standard Time.
[00:33:23.058 --> 00:33:26.479]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.782]  And the websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, Infowars.net.
[00:33:34.778 --> 00:33:41.560]  We're going to go to John and Bill and Marilyn and Don and John and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.040]  I'm kind of glad this happened.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:56.603]  I had this guest set up last Friday when this article came out and the guest is rescheduled until Thursday or until Wednesday if I'm even able to have him on then because I've got other guests lined up for that day.
[00:33:57.236 --> 00:33:59.897]  Concerning this article, draft may be needed in a year.
[00:34:00.377 --> 00:34:01.777]  Military analyst warned.
[00:34:01.797 --> 00:34:05.358]  This out of Koch News Service, carried by the Arizona Republic.
[00:34:05.378 --> 00:34:12.839]  But I'm still going to cover this article in the next hour, but that will give us more time to take your calls and cover this extremely large stack.
[00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:16.520]  You know, I was chomping at the bit Friday to get on air.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.601]  So I did a segment live.
[00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:25.482]  Maybe once or twice a year, the digital lines from Austin, Texas to Minnesota go down.
[00:34:26.551 --> 00:34:29.812]  And it happened right at the start of the broadcast Friday.
[00:34:29.832 --> 00:34:31.813]  We even have a backup location.
[00:34:31.873 --> 00:34:33.133]  I didn't go to the backup location.
[00:34:33.153 --> 00:34:43.237]  I just ran a rebroadcast because we had so many requests for those two interviews I'd done earlier in the week with Jim Tucker and then also with that CFR member about torture.
[00:34:43.257 --> 00:34:44.077]  So we re-aired that.
[00:34:44.117 --> 00:34:49.559]  But I was chomping at the bit to comment on the imminent demise of Pope John Paul II.
[00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:56.142]  On Michael Schiavo saying he wouldn't allow the parents even to the funeral, or to know where she's buried.
[00:34:56.723 --> 00:34:57.783]  Talk about abusive!
[00:34:58.464 --> 00:35:01.665]  Or how he wouldn't allow them in to see her in her final hours.
[00:35:02.786 --> 00:35:03.967]  Just very evil.
[00:35:05.107 --> 00:35:11.471]  And I've got just a bunch of other news left over from Friday I didn't get to, plus masses of news from this weekend.
[00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:19.956]  Good news, bad news, national ID card news, total amnesty for illegal aliens news, information about the Minutemen on the southern border,
[00:35:20.811 --> 00:35:23.133]  The Mexican gangs and troops saying they want to kill them.
[00:35:24.854 --> 00:35:26.735]  But number one, I want to take your calls.
[00:35:26.855 --> 00:35:28.936]  I know you want to get involved on air.
[00:35:29.016 --> 00:35:33.779]  So what we'll do is I'm going to take ten calls in a row here in just a moment.
[00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:34.340]  Quickly!
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.881]  I'm going to go to you quickly.
[00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.163]  So you can have two questions or two comments.
[00:35:40.083 --> 00:35:42.485]  Or you can scream at me for 90 seconds.
[00:35:43.406 --> 00:35:45.447]  Total free speech, but I've got to limit your time.
[00:35:46.207 --> 00:35:50.230]  That means I've got to limit my commenting on the interesting things you always say.
[00:35:51.244 --> 00:35:56.247]  We take more calls than any of the other Patriot shows out there because I believe in your calls.
[00:35:56.307 --> 00:35:57.308]  I enjoy hearing from you.
[00:35:57.828 --> 00:35:59.269]  But that's a catch-22.
[00:35:59.729 --> 00:36:04.132]  It means I can't give you ten minutes to run on at the mouth like I do.
[00:36:05.072 --> 00:36:05.452]  All right.
[00:36:05.953 --> 00:36:13.057]  Before we run out of time, my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:15.638]  It is my best video.
[00:36:15.758 --> 00:36:18.320]  It is over three hours long on DVD.
[00:36:19.972 --> 00:36:23.653]  Yes, a little over 3 hours long on DVD.
[00:36:23.673 --> 00:36:30.315]  2 hours 35 and a half minutes roughly on VHS.
[00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:33.516]  It is the best video I've ever made.
[00:36:33.536 --> 00:36:37.878]  The reviews are overwhelmingly, well not overwhelmingly, 100% positive.
[00:36:39.887 --> 00:36:41.688]  We have posted all the reviews.
[00:36:43.688 --> 00:36:44.469]  Anything negative?
[00:36:44.509 --> 00:36:45.289]  I'm still asking.
[00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:46.729]  You want to send me a negative review?
[00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:50.091]  We'll post it on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:51.331 --> 00:37:00.534]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.TV for 15 cents a day and you can get a monthly or a yearly subscription on our secure shopping cart.

[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.803]  My weekly TV report I do every week.
[00:37:13.584 --> 00:37:15.867]  My best audio interviews from the radio show.
[00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:19.211]  Special video interviews I do that you don't see on TV.
[00:37:22.182 --> 00:37:29.068]  In my films, the only place you can get some of this stuff, like the Dean Haglund interview, are on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:29.468 --> 00:37:32.851]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other books, a bunch of other videos.
[00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:35.813]  Folks, one e-book usually costs five, six bucks.
[00:37:36.374 --> 00:37:45.621]  You get like ten e-books, dozens of films, hundreds of TV reports, hundreds of audio interviews, hundreds of special text reports.
[00:37:46.922 --> 00:37:51.006]  PrisonPlanet.tv, it is just an insanely good deal.
[00:37:52.398 --> 00:37:54.419]  That's because we just want it to pay for itself.
[00:37:54.499 --> 00:37:55.039]  That's the goal.
[00:37:55.879 --> 00:37:59.721]  And still, about half the video we put out is for free, and you can go watch it even if you're not a member.
[00:38:00.261 --> 00:38:03.302]  But for exclusive total access, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:03.742 --> 00:38:05.763]  But the DVD is out!
[00:38:05.943 --> 00:38:09.124]  The DVD of Martial Law is out!
[00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:11.945]  You need to get this DVD.
[00:38:12.005 --> 00:38:16.267]  It's a DVD 9, double layers, so you don't lose any of the quality.
[00:38:17.012 --> 00:38:18.614]  High-quality DVD.
[00:38:19.695 --> 00:38:21.536]  It's amazing.
[00:38:21.596 --> 00:38:22.457]  I'm very proud of it.
[00:38:22.497 --> 00:38:29.284]  It covers the latest police state developments, what really happened on 9-11, and the occultic background of the New World Order.
[00:38:29.704 --> 00:38:32.947]  The Schwarzenegger-Nazi connections, the Bush-Nazi connections.
[00:38:33.588 --> 00:38:35.390]  It's unlike any film you've ever seen.
[00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.090]  You've got to get it.
[00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:39.013]  The toll-free number to order is 888.
[00:38:40.469 --> 00:38:41.309]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-triple-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:44.890]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.971]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:11.193]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:11.233 --> 00:39:15.714]  Alright, let's go straight back to your calls quickly.
[00:39:15.874 --> 00:39:17.635]  John in Ohio, go ahead.
[00:39:18.015 --> 00:39:20.756]  I've got so much to say, I hope you'll give me time, Alex.
[00:39:20.796 --> 00:39:21.616]  You've got 90 seconds.
[00:39:21.796 --> 00:39:22.256]  Oh, geez.
[00:39:22.476 --> 00:39:24.537]  It won't work, but I'll try what I can.
[00:39:25.617 --> 00:39:27.938]  I support much of what you say.
[00:39:28.238 --> 00:39:30.199]  I have donated to you, contributed.
[00:39:31.319 --> 00:39:34.420]  I've endorsed and plugged your website on talk shows.
[00:39:35.161 --> 00:39:38.442]  But I have some serious disagreements, and I have to say,
[00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:41.063]  There are three issues I want to talk about.
[00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:44.207]  The Pope, government-sponsored terrorism, and a third topic.
[00:39:44.268 --> 00:39:45.589]  Well, see, this is an exception.
[00:39:45.629 --> 00:39:48.233]  Since you disagree with me, you get two and a half minutes, but go ahead.
[00:39:48.872 --> 00:40:02.057]  Okay, I think on the issues that I disagree with you, and it's heartbreaking to me, that you're working at cross purposes to your own stated objectives of opposing the globalist New World Order criminals.
[00:40:02.097 --> 00:40:10.560]  In regard to the Pope's position during the 80s, for instance, I don't see him in any way as an opponent of the New World Order.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:16.323]  He was an ally of the military-industrial complex, the CIA, and the neocons, and the Reagan-Bush administration.
[00:40:16.383 --> 00:40:17.203]  Carl Bernstein,
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.922]  No, it's admitted that he secretly met with the CIA routinely.
[00:40:22.742 --> 00:40:24.043]  That was admitted.
[00:40:24.383 --> 00:40:28.706]  Yes, and coordinating their operations to overthrow the Eastern European countries.
[00:40:29.287 --> 00:40:31.028]  At the same time that he was...
[00:40:31.952 --> 00:40:54.479]  uh... uh... ignoring the fact that uh... these neocons of the reagan-bush administration had uh... killed hundreds of thousands of people through their death squad regimes in central america even murdering american men has increased the uh... the archbishop of romero of uh... of uh... el salvador when he he he uh... implored the united states to stop sending these arms that he said were slaughtering their people he was uh... slaughtered by a c.i.
[00:40:55.079 --> 00:40:58.400]  trained death squad at the same time he was doing that he was uh...
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.221]  Well, let me just stop you.
[00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:03.582]  I mean, look, understand, I'm not here... I said we can get your views on Pope John Paul II.
[00:41:17.606 --> 00:41:22.072]  Okay, now at the same time though, he's been against, he was against the Iraq War.
[00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:22.833]  Yes.
[00:41:22.933 --> 00:41:24.335]  I'm just trying to be fair here.
[00:41:24.495 --> 00:41:34.329]  Well, I think he evolved in the 90's to the point, and that could even be interpreted by the fact that he represented a much larger audience than the American military industrial complex.
[00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:35.050]  He represented
[00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.732]  Well, the point I'm making is, in the Operation Northwoods,
[00:42:00.444 --> 00:42:05.769]  You always point out that that was directed to murdering Americans to frame up
[00:42:06.636 --> 00:42:08.217]  Uh, the enemies of globalism.
[00:42:08.377 --> 00:42:11.539]  But you don't mention that, though, that enemy, specifically, was Cuba.
[00:42:11.999 --> 00:42:13.479]  So Cuba is... Well, I do, too!
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.021]  I mean, I mention that all the time, and in my film, I do.
[00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:24.585]  You mention, in a very vague way, the enemies of globalism, but you do not specify the only specific target of Operation Global, uh, uh, uh, Northwest was Cuba.
[00:42:25.145 --> 00:42:33.850]  And that, uh, I think ignores the fact that Cuba has been opposing the New World Order... Listen, John, I give you... Before you were born... Gotta let you go, and then I gotta comment for 30 seconds.
[00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:34.570]  Listen to me.
[00:42:35.876 --> 00:42:39.979]  This is how the left and right get caught in the same treadmill.
[00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:41.300]  This little eddy pool.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.821]  This whortle pool.
[00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:43.681]  We've got to get out of it.
[00:42:44.582 --> 00:42:49.886]  The communists killed over a hundred million people.
[00:42:50.806 --> 00:42:52.227]  Hundreds of thousands in Cuba.
[00:42:53.188 --> 00:42:54.809]  Over fifty million in Russia.
[00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.171]  Fifty million plus in China.
[00:42:57.891 --> 00:43:01.994]  Over a million, well, I mean, Pol Pot, two million.
[00:43:03.475 --> 00:43:04.516]  North Korea, a million.
[00:43:05.723 --> 00:43:11.066]  The New World Order, the globalist bankers, and this is history, funded the Communists.
[00:43:11.947 --> 00:43:15.249]  And you don't get that, and you don't understand they play both ends.
[00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:17.670]  And you don't understand that.
[00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:19.491]  And you don't get that.
[00:43:20.232 --> 00:43:24.895]  I'll say the Contras are bad, but I'll also say that the FARC are bad.
[00:43:25.395 --> 00:43:26.255]  The Communists are bad.
[00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:27.576]  They're all a bunch of thugs.
[00:43:29.157 --> 00:43:30.398]  They're thugs, folks.
[00:43:30.998 --> 00:43:31.799]  It's government.
[00:43:31.879 --> 00:43:32.819]  Government's bad.
[00:43:32.919 --> 00:43:33.920]  Government's dangerous.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.281]  Government's gotta be restricted.
[00:43:37.394 --> 00:43:38.394]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[00:43:38.414 --> 00:43:39.075]  Bill, go ahead.
[00:43:39.815 --> 00:43:41.697]  Yeah, thanks Alex for taking my call.
[00:43:41.757 --> 00:43:46.100]  Hey, I am Catholic and have been so my entire life.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.462]  I go back to my college days.
[00:43:49.622 --> 00:43:51.143]  I'm going to get Hutton Gibson on.
[00:43:51.204 --> 00:43:53.145]  Oh yeah, that's what I was just going to tell you.
[00:43:53.165 --> 00:43:54.866]  He's an expert on this.
[00:43:54.966 --> 00:44:01.431]  In fact, instant message my wife, for the folks running the show, instant message her and tell her, call Hutton, see if we can get him on.
[00:44:02.111 --> 00:44:05.674]  Alright, now don't take this off my time.
[00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:11.080]  John Paul II was an infiltrator.
[00:44:11.221 --> 00:44:12.982]  I believe he was a sleeper.
[00:44:13.522 --> 00:44:20.047]  He came into the Catholic clergy during the time of the switch between the Nazis and the Communists.
[00:44:20.667 --> 00:44:29.554]  When there were bishops, cardinals, and archbishops being persecuted behind the Iron Curtain, he was allowed to go wherever he wanted.
[00:44:30.094 --> 00:44:30.995]  Where did he go?
[00:44:31.015 --> 00:44:34.417]  He came to Harvard and received awards.
[00:44:35.351 --> 00:44:38.834]  He was a darling of the New World Order right from the start.
[00:44:39.615 --> 00:44:51.005]  Now, what they have done by their infiltration is change 2,000 years of Catholic truth, Catholic dogma, the sacraments, and everything else.
[00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:56.530]  He has set up a college of cardinals that's rigged.
[00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:59.773]  You talk all the time about rigged elections.
[00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:01.254]  This next one
[00:45:01.756 --> 00:45:07.617]  Unless God intervenes, it's going to be even worse than what's transpired.
[00:45:08.218 --> 00:45:17.740]  So for you Catholics out there that would talk about John Paul being the Pope of the Church, he's not!
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:30.983]  He is a creature of this satanic system that is destroying all of God's true teachings, and everything that he has done has been
[00:45:31.613 --> 00:45:34.495]  In favor of promotion of the New World Order.
[00:45:34.515 --> 00:45:37.558]  Well, he has promoted the New World Order, and he has promoted One World Religion.
[00:45:37.598 --> 00:45:38.278]  I have his quotes.
[00:45:38.539 --> 00:45:41.181]  But let me ask you, why was he then against the Iraq War?
[00:45:41.261 --> 00:45:42.301]  Is that good cop, bad cop?
[00:45:42.702 --> 00:45:59.235]  Yeah, and I would also say that he does take, even though he condemns Marxian position, like Paul VI, John Paul II, they take pretty much a socialist Marxian position on these things.
[00:45:59.475 --> 00:46:00.716]  Even when he takes
[00:46:01.326 --> 00:46:03.387]  An issue like abortion.
[00:46:03.587 --> 00:46:07.508]  It's not we are violating God's law against murder.
[00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:12.310]  We are doing something against mankind and against humanity.
[00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.511]  Everything is from a humanistic viewpoint.
[00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:16.752]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:46:18.472 --> 00:46:21.234]  Let's talk now to Marilyn Mass.
[00:46:21.314 --> 00:46:22.334]  Marilyn, go ahead.
[00:46:23.379 --> 00:46:24.040]  Good afternoon.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.600]  Hello.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:33.267]  I would like to ask your comment on late Friday afternoon I heard a shortwave program that said President Bush is going to resign at the end of April.
[00:46:33.548 --> 00:46:34.489]  Have you heard such a thing?
[00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:36.110]  And if so, what does it pretend?
[00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.431]  I don't believe that.
[00:46:37.471 --> 00:46:37.691]  Oh, okay.
[00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:40.894]  I don't know who said that, but I just... Okay.
[00:46:41.595 --> 00:46:43.476]  That sounds pretty ridiculous.
[00:46:43.536 --> 00:46:43.957]  Thank you.
[00:46:44.717 --> 00:46:44.957]  Thanks.
[00:46:45.018 --> 00:46:47.319]  I enjoy your program and thank you so much for doing it.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.240]  Well, thank you.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.501]  I appreciate that call.
[00:46:49.581 --> 00:46:50.082]  Anything else?
[00:46:51.184 --> 00:46:51.825]  Thank you, Marilyn.
[00:46:52.185 --> 00:46:54.347]  I would add this so I don't run out of time and forget.
[00:46:55.447 --> 00:47:06.916]  One reason I was chomping on the bit to get on the air Friday was I'm listening to Bush give a speech that morning and he says, oh, see, the CIA gave us bad information about Iraq.
[00:47:07.036 --> 00:47:10.959]  That's why I've got to reorganize everything and expand and get more funding.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.521]  Boy, they're really bad over there.
[00:47:14.722 --> 00:47:16.284]  And the CIA just puts up with it.
[00:47:16.324 --> 00:47:18.505]  They've got Porter Goss, their minion of 9-11,
[00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:26.572]  Who met with the 9-11 fag man on the morning of 9-11, General Amun Ahmed, who wired $100,000 to Mohammed Adam.
[00:47:27.072 --> 00:47:31.854]  Dick Cheney went 10 times to the CIA and ordered their analysts to lie!
[00:47:32.155 --> 00:47:33.155]  Now this is admitted!
[00:47:35.276 --> 00:47:48.202]  Dick Cheney wrote in September 2000 on the PNAC website, it's public, they even put it in hardcover, that Saddam wasn't a threat, but they could use him as a pretext to get the oil and to use Iraq as a weapons base.
[00:47:48.863 --> 00:47:50.565]  A military base, and for weapons sales.
[00:47:50.585 --> 00:47:54.328]  I mean, forget Richard Clark saying this, you can say he's partisan.
[00:47:54.608 --> 00:47:56.750]  Forget John O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary.
[00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.052]  What about when Dick Cheney says it?
[00:48:00.293 --> 00:48:01.794]  It's not Alex Jones saying it.
[00:48:02.295 --> 00:48:03.736]  It's not Richard Clark saying it.
[00:48:03.776 --> 00:48:07.099]  It's not... It's the people in power.
[00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:09.621]  So, I mean, they've got a lot of nerve, folks.
[00:48:11.382 --> 00:48:13.264]  They go and do this, and now they've got
[00:48:14.759 --> 00:48:18.540]  Negroponte, the Death Squad Commander, now is the head of all intelligence?
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.281]  I mean, this is scary.
[00:48:19.941 --> 00:48:20.421]  Don?
[00:48:21.121 --> 00:48:22.262]  Don, where are you calling me from?
[00:48:23.582 --> 00:48:24.763]  Hello, Don, where are you calling from?
[00:48:24.923 --> 00:48:25.643]  Illinois, sir.
[00:48:25.783 --> 00:48:26.123]  Welcome.
[00:48:26.483 --> 00:48:27.524]  Well, thank you for having me.
[00:48:28.084 --> 00:48:28.724]  My two things.
[00:48:28.904 --> 00:48:33.486]  One, I just observed some strange articles when I was getting my hair cut in Maxim Magazine.
[00:48:34.306 --> 00:48:36.227]  One of them is about, it's almost a...
[00:48:39.355 --> 00:48:39.996]  Well, too bad.
[00:48:40.036 --> 00:48:41.317]  I wanted to hear what you had to say.
[00:48:41.697 --> 00:48:42.197]  Beg your pardon?
[00:48:42.478 --> 00:48:42.958]  Oh, you're okay.
[00:48:42.978 --> 00:48:43.598]  I thought you were gone.
[00:48:43.618 --> 00:48:44.399]  Your phone's cutting out.
[00:48:44.459 --> 00:48:45.180]  Oh, I apologize.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.843]  It's about their new active denial system on the new Humvees, which is what I've heard you talk about.
[00:48:49.883 --> 00:48:51.144]  It's the microwave system.
[00:48:51.405 --> 00:48:51.685]  Yes.
[00:48:51.945 --> 00:48:52.946]  And it's talking about that.
[00:48:52.966 --> 00:48:58.010]  It's just a little cartoon, almost making fun of it and telling people that it's just kind of like a joke.
[00:48:58.651 --> 00:49:03.995]  And in the cartoon, it shows the Marines, and they're saying, this thing won't kill nobody, so we can shoot first.
[00:49:06.187 --> 00:49:14.242]  Well, if you watch Police State 2000, I have the Marines actually saying that on tape at an urban warfare drill in Oakland that I mentioned earlier.
[00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:20.300]  And they've got sound cannons, microwave guns, and on low it just burns your skin.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.500]  That's exactly what it says.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:31.064]  But on high it will kill you, and they have been secretly deploying these around the United States according to declassified government documents two years ago.
[00:49:31.304 --> 00:49:37.966]  Well the other Max Markle, I just happened to pick up another one while I was sitting there waiting, talks about the second wave of Al-Qaeda attacks on the United States.
[00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:42.761]  And they're going to attack the shopping malls and you better give up all your knives?
[00:49:43.641 --> 00:49:46.263]  My last thing, it's something strange I observed.
[00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:50.507]  I was watching an old movie, Tombstone, with Kurt Russell the other night.
[00:49:50.527 --> 00:49:52.108]  Yeah, it's a good movie.
[00:49:52.148 --> 00:50:00.815]  Did you happen to notice in the scene where the two cowboys come out of the bar, they're friends of his, and they're talking to him when they're first talking to Doc Holliday.
[00:50:00.835 --> 00:50:02.536]  One of them has a Mason necklace on.
[00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:04.572]  I didn't notice that.
[00:50:04.852 --> 00:50:05.813]  Yeah, if you watch it.
[00:50:05.893 --> 00:50:08.414]  But they were masons, so that's historically accurate.
[00:50:08.434 --> 00:50:10.094]  Alright, I was unaware of that.
[00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:11.555]  Well, thank you very much, sir.
[00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:12.695]  It was a pleasure talking to you.
[00:50:12.795 --> 00:50:14.076]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:14.416 --> 00:50:15.316]  Very interesting points.
[00:50:15.996 --> 00:50:18.957]  And what he raises is historically true.
[00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:20.818]  I mean, most lawmen were masons.
[00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:25.240]  And then you get off into this... And again, folks, I'm not defending masons.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.520]  They're very evil at the top.
[00:50:28.421 --> 00:50:31.782]  But if we just bash masons, then masons who aren't high-level
[00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:34.090]  Get angry and think we're liars.
[00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.752]  It's compartmentalized like an intelligence agency.
[00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:41.334]  It's the same thing with the Jewish organizations.
[00:50:41.374 --> 00:50:43.175]  Same thing with the Protestant organizations.
[00:50:43.635 --> 00:50:45.336]  Same thing with the Catholic organizations.
[00:50:45.996 --> 00:50:48.918]  It's all compartmentalized and New World Order controlled.
[00:50:49.638 --> 00:50:51.119]  That's why the New World Order is in power.
[00:50:51.879 --> 00:50:55.121]  They're excellent at seizing control of the highest echelons.
[00:50:56.502 --> 00:50:57.622]  Order out of chaos.
[00:50:57.682 --> 00:50:58.743]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:50:58.763 --> 00:50:59.203]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.494 --> 00:51:08.336]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.657 --> 00:51:10.037]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.217 --> 00:51:12.418]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.578 --> 00:51:14.659]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.939 --> 00:51:19.880]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:24.242]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:26.263]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.343 --> 00:51:37.012]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.152 --> 00:51:39.053]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.253 --> 00:51:43.116]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[00:52:00.911 --> 00:52:04.794]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.034 --> 00:52:10.459]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.739 --> 00:52:21.107]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.287 --> 00:52:25.611]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.931 --> 00:52:26.632]  I don't know.
[00:52:40.742 --> 00:52:41.262]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:02.610]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.435 --> 00:53:18.095]  We're good to go.

[00:54:03.971 --> 00:54:09.993]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.593 --> 00:54:13.554]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:20.597 --> 00:54:23.298]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:23.318 --> 00:54:26.999]  54 minutes into this hour, got two full hours coming up.
[00:54:27.554 --> 00:54:28.854]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do in the third hour.
[00:54:28.914 --> 00:54:32.035]  I'm going to get Brad Friedman on from the Brad Blog.
[00:54:32.055 --> 00:54:44.517]  He's broke some major news stories about election fraud and it turns out we've got a neocon front group arguing, quote, for voter rights, but really they're pushing for these no paper trail electronic voting machines.
[00:54:45.877 --> 00:54:49.758]  But we're going to continue with your phone calls throughout this broadcast today.
[00:54:50.218 --> 00:54:56.739]  Coming up in the next hour I'm going to launch into Pope John Paul II called for a new world order, but he also was against the war.
[00:54:57.657 --> 00:55:02.765]  And then we'll get into total amnesty for the illegal aliens in Congress right now in the Senate.
[00:55:03.606 --> 00:55:04.968]  There's just so much coming up.
[00:55:06.608 --> 00:55:08.669]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:55:09.029 --> 00:55:25.498]  I just want to mention that Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, for those that were waiting for it to come out on DVD, we now have the DVD, over three hours long, really three films in one, by best work, Martial Law is now out on DVD.
[00:55:26.358 --> 00:55:30.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Boston.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.741]  Welcome, John.
[00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.201]  Hell yeah, Alex.
[00:55:33.261 --> 00:55:33.802]  How are you?
[00:55:33.982 --> 00:55:34.302]  Good, sir.
[00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:35.132]  Good.
[00:55:35.312 --> 00:55:36.673]  I'll try to make this real quick.
[00:55:37.354 --> 00:55:40.156]  I've been gathering some information.
[00:55:40.176 --> 00:55:49.122]  I found out that there is a class at Harvard University, and this class teaches the students how to debunk conspiracy theories.
[00:55:50.063 --> 00:55:55.306]  It teaches them the major conspiracies, if you will, and how to go about debunking them.
[00:55:55.607 --> 00:56:00.210]  The professor, I believe he's an attendee of Bohemian Grove,
[00:56:01.344 --> 00:56:04.866]  I'm going to try to get some more information on this and get it out to you.
[00:56:04.886 --> 00:56:22.634]  Well, they have another professor at another Ivy League university, I forget his name, but he attacked me for an hour on C-SPAN, wearing Masonic rings, flashing hand signs on TV, saying, basically, Bohemian Grove doesn't exist, and that's the course he teaches.
[00:56:22.654 --> 00:56:23.675]  Really?
[00:56:23.695 --> 00:56:30.918]  And they teach that it's a mental illness, that the global government doesn't exist, even as the government calls for it, that none of this stuff's happening.
[00:56:31.846 --> 00:56:35.929]  No, I know, and I mean, I have actually spoken to this person's child.
[00:56:36.409 --> 00:56:38.391]  She's an older person now.
[00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:46.496]  But, you know, she actually made mention that he would talk about his friends in the Illuminati, or things of that sort.
[00:56:47.057 --> 00:56:49.098]  So I'm really kind of interested in this.
[00:56:49.318 --> 00:56:54.222]  I gave her your film, Police State, Total Enslavement.
[00:56:54.762 --> 00:57:00.486]  I'm going to make her a copy of the new one, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, see if I can get maybe into the class or do something there.
[00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:01.881]  Go check it out.
[00:57:01.941 --> 00:57:04.222]  Maybe I'll get back to you with some more info on that.
[00:57:05.743 --> 00:57:07.983]  Well, you know, they can run but they can't hide.
[00:57:08.043 --> 00:57:11.004]  People are waking up to the New World Order everywhere right now.
[00:57:12.005 --> 00:57:12.325]  It's true.
[00:57:12.365 --> 00:57:13.445]  I've been seeing it everywhere.
[00:57:13.545 --> 00:57:18.227]  People that I engage and talk with, no matter where it is, they're always interested to hear.
[00:57:18.267 --> 00:57:19.507]  They know something's not right.
[00:57:19.607 --> 00:57:20.187]  They don't know what it is.
[00:57:20.207 --> 00:57:21.868]  And five years ago, they'd laugh at you.
[00:57:22.748 --> 00:57:30.270]  They still laugh at me, some of them, but most people are really interested in your videos and your work, so I think it is, we are changing things right now.
[00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:33.090]  We are, thanks to people like you, thanks for the call.
[00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:35.811]  Owen in Washington, Owen, go ahead.
[00:57:37.231 --> 00:57:38.691]  Yeah, I've got a question for you, Alex.
[00:57:39.171 --> 00:57:39.472]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:39.952 --> 00:57:45.133]  Why don't more of these talk shows tell everyone about the Social Security issue, since it's a big public issue now?
[00:57:46.813 --> 00:57:51.154]  Well, we should talk about that, because this isn't really privatization, this is going to be eluding
[00:57:51.914 --> 00:57:56.856]  And I talked about privatization being a fraud last week because it isn't real privatization.
[00:57:56.896 --> 00:58:00.257]  Well, Alex, why don't we talk about the truth and why don't we tell them that it's unconstitutional?
[00:58:01.138 --> 00:58:04.639]  Judge Robert Bork was on the C-SPAN and told everyone it was unconstitutional.
[00:58:04.659 --> 00:58:05.179]  Well, it is.
[00:58:05.279 --> 00:58:18.905]  I mean, we never should have gotten into the government paying people's pensions because they would use it to control people and now that's happening, but now we've got our neck in the noose, we've paid into this thing, and it's kind of a catch-22.
[00:58:19.983 --> 00:58:22.524]  Well, the thing is, though, people gotta understand it's voluntary.
[00:58:24.725 --> 00:58:30.708]  It is voluntary to a certain extent, but now the government's acting in such a criminal fashion that they'll claim that it isn't voluntary.
[00:58:30.988 --> 00:58:33.949]  Yeah, I don't have a social security number, so that makes it hell for them.
[00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:39.312]  That's a whole other area of discussion, but it is interesting.
[00:58:39.332 --> 00:58:39.792]  Anything else?
[00:58:40.652 --> 00:58:45.414]  No, I just wanted to know why more radio shows don't bring up the fact that it's voluntary and it's unconstitutional.
[00:58:46.035 --> 00:58:48.056]  Well, you just did, my compadre.
[00:58:48.096 --> 00:58:48.736]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.921 --> 00:58:58.647]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.308 --> 00:59:00.389]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:02.190]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:03.651]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.412 --> 00:59:05.333]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.973 --> 00:59:09.637]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.157 --> 00:59:14.241]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.992]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:18.052 --> 00:59:19.013]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:19.654 --> 00:59:22.376]  Central Standard Time and back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:23.237 --> 00:59:24.178]  We're here my friends.
[00:59:24.238 --> 00:59:29.963]  Thank you for joining us on this April 4th 2005 edition.
[00:59:31.144 --> 00:59:34.266]  We're gonna have wide open phones for the rest of this hour.
[00:59:34.306 --> 00:59:42.053]  We got a guest coming up about the latest developments not just in staged media groups and staged media buys by this government.
[00:59:42.959 --> 00:59:51.766]  Republicans and Democrats, though Bush is expanding it like never before, but also fake grassroots organizations concerning electronic voting.
[00:59:52.006 --> 00:59:57.310]  Fake grassroots organizations pushing for electronic no-record voting machines.
[00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:02.653]  Also, I want to get into, obviously, Pope John Paul II is dead.
[01:00:02.673 --> 01:00:05.175]  Draft may be needed in a year.
[01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:06.336]  Military analyst warned.
[01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:07.377]  I'll cover this when we get back.
[01:00:08.974 --> 01:00:13.036]  Some good news with major states now moving to throw out the Patriot Act.
[01:00:14.217 --> 01:00:16.998]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:20.720]  Let's talk to John in California.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.721]  Go ahead, John.
[01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:22.761]  Good day.
[01:00:22.861 --> 01:00:25.662]  John Connor here, author of the Resistance Manifesto.
[01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:26.423]  Good morning, sir.
[01:00:27.193 --> 01:00:28.494]  Hello, John Connor.
[01:00:28.574 --> 01:00:32.235]  Are you even busy battling the Terminators?
[01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:34.476]  So to speak.
[01:00:34.596 --> 01:00:41.198]  Actually, it's interesting because you were speaking about the Foster-Miller, Hunter-Killer robots, which are actually the precursor to that.
[01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.259]  But first of all, I just want to thank you.
[01:00:43.279 --> 01:00:46.980]  You're a beacon of truth out there, and our prayers go out to you.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.022]  And I want to just speak for 30 seconds on the Georgia Guidestones, if I could, sir.
[01:00:51.722 --> 01:00:54.223]  Oh, where they say they're going to kill us down to 500 mil?
[01:00:55.419 --> 01:01:08.125]  Yeah, basically, for your listeners who aren't aware, the Georgia Guidestones are an enormous 19-foot tall granite monument built 25 years ago where the First Commandment is to maintain the population at 500 million.
[01:01:08.145 --> 01:01:12.407]  It talks about creating a world court, uniting us with a world language.
[01:01:12.447 --> 01:01:13.948]  They're the Illuminati's Ten Commandments.
[01:01:14.008 --> 01:01:16.609]  You were talking about them in 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:01:17.614 --> 01:01:20.456]  Basically, the resistance is calling for the removal.
[01:01:20.496 --> 01:01:27.262]  We're launching a national campaign to have these satanic Ten Commandments removed, along with our boycott of the Virgin Sacred.
[01:01:27.282 --> 01:01:30.864]  Well, it's also very secretive who owns the property and the Godstones.
[01:01:31.185 --> 01:01:32.626]  Well, actually, yeah.
[01:01:32.646 --> 01:01:33.947]  I want to get into that for a second.
[01:01:34.047 --> 01:01:39.051]  The man who paid for these things came into the Elberton Granite Association anonymously
[01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:42.234]  And he paid for them under a pseudonym of R.C.
[01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:42.754]  Christian.
[01:01:42.774 --> 01:01:55.447]  Many people think that that's Roman Catholic Christian, but it's actually Rose Cross Christian, going back to the Rosicrucians, sort of a Masonic, cultic, 15th, 16th century cult organization.
[01:01:55.507 --> 01:01:59.271]  So, nobody in the town of Elberton knows who paid for these things.
[01:01:59.612 --> 01:02:00.773]  The original file
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.361]  from the Grand Association who created them was given to this individual upon completion.
[01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:09.402]  So since 1980 nobody knows who this man is.
[01:02:09.502 --> 01:02:10.683]  But who owns the property?
[01:02:10.723 --> 01:02:11.423]  That'll tell you.
[01:02:11.783 --> 01:02:14.144]  Well, I investigated this.
[01:02:14.444 --> 01:02:19.125]  The property was deeded to the city by an individual
[01:02:20.114 --> 01:02:22.194]  And the city now owns that property.
[01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:24.595]  It's sitting on a five-acre plot.
[01:02:24.795 --> 01:02:26.115]  But who deeded the property?
[01:02:26.155 --> 01:02:27.135]  That'll be your connection.
[01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:29.116]  Yeah, I do have that connection.
[01:02:29.196 --> 01:02:30.896]  I don't have... That is your link.
[01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:36.857]  Well, his name was Wayne Malamoo, but he was out of town, and I've interviewed him.
[01:02:36.937 --> 01:02:49.780]  He was out of town the day that Mr. Christian came in, and from what I can gather, he wanted Mr. Christian to complete the monument, because it's an expensive project for the association, and he would have been doing the engraving.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:59.265]  Now, many people say that, oh, it's a publicity stunt from these individuals to create an aura for the Granite Association.
[01:02:59.726 --> 01:03:01.006]  And that's one way to look at it.
[01:03:01.427 --> 01:03:09.051]  But I believe that he deeded the land to the city so that the project would go ahead, so that Mr. Christian would pay for it.
[01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:13.714]  This construction project... And we've got to ask, why does the city have an occult monument?
[01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:23.597]  Well, we don't know, and Mr. Christian says that he chose the city of Elberton because his grandmother was from the city.
[01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:33.263]  Now, we know that the Illuminati and the Global like to put things in our face, but then their doublespeak, their spin, makes other people say, oh, well, that's okay.
[01:03:33.604 --> 01:03:35.065]  This is the real reason for that.
[01:03:35.405 --> 01:03:41.589]  And so, part of the reason why this small town was chosen is because Elberton is the granite association of the world.
[01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:51.564]  So, to defuse the conspiracy, people will just go and say... Stay there, we'll be... We've got a break, but I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[01:03:51.584 --> 01:03:52.325]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:03:54.548 --> 01:03:57.412]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:58.127 --> 01:03:59.407]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:59.607 --> 01:04:05.349]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:05.629 --> 01:04:10.891]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:11.171 --> 01:04:15.292]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:19.276]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:19.537 --> 01:04:24.162]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.

[01:06:54.435 --> 01:06:56.596]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.176 --> 01:07:00.037]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.137 --> 01:07:14.141]  Alright, we're now into the second segment of the second hour.
[01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:17.122]  8 minutes, 30 seconds in.
[01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.312]  Senate opens the door to alien amnesty.
[01:07:25.053 --> 01:07:27.355]  Doesn't matter if 80 plus percent of you don't want that.
[01:07:27.435 --> 01:07:29.757]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[01:07:31.258 --> 01:07:32.599]  They just don't care.
[01:07:32.679 --> 01:07:33.560]  Another article here.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.882]  Photo of Marines banned due to guns.
[01:07:37.042 --> 01:07:41.186]  Students invited to create montage showing activities of graduates.
[01:07:42.387 --> 01:07:43.708]  So see there's the mind control.
[01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:49.152]  You can have weapons and bombs and violent video games but high school seniors can't
[01:07:50.365 --> 01:07:57.350]  Put the little section on the back of the yearbook, something they've always done, of, oh, here's graduates from two years ago.
[01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:00.832]  Oh, look, they're in the Marines, and here they are with their guns.
[01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:02.453]  See, mind control.
[01:08:02.493 --> 01:08:05.495]  You're arrested if you write the word gun.
[01:08:07.136 --> 01:08:12.059]  But then at the same time, if you're walking around the school saying, I'm going to shoot and kill everybody, they just leave you alone magically.
[01:08:12.987 --> 01:08:18.229]  But you write a fiction story about zombies attacking an imaginary school, you get arrested.
[01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.469]  See?
[01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:20.789]  This is all staged, folks.
[01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:24.010]  This is modern mind control.
[01:08:24.691 --> 01:08:26.071]  No other way to put it.
[01:08:27.612 --> 01:08:34.954]  Going back to John in California, he called in the last segment, for those that just joined us, talking about the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:41.836]  And the Guidestones, they won't tell you who owns them, why they're there, now on city property.
[01:08:43.673 --> 01:08:50.078]  And on it is all this occultic numerology and language and keep the world population at 500 million.
[01:08:50.098 --> 01:08:55.062]  The world population is at 6,300,000,000 right now.
[01:08:55.883 --> 01:08:59.005]  So that's an 80, 90 plus percent reduction.
[01:08:59.946 --> 01:09:03.949]  And Ted Turner and Prince Philip and Jacques Cousteau and all these famous people call for it.
[01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:05.911]  And the caller,
[01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.195]  Everything he said checks out, because I've researched it.
[01:09:09.215 --> 01:09:18.419]  He was saying that he's been researching it and had some more comments for us, but here it is now, owned by the city there, and finish up what you were saying, John.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:30.865]  There is a link, at least last week, on Infowars.com called Dismantling the Georgia Guidestones, and it goes into somewhat detail about the resistance campaign to have them removed, about the history of the guidestones.
[01:09:30.925 --> 01:09:35.127]  It was posted from the Canadian Free Press last week, and can I just take
[01:09:35.652 --> 01:09:38.514]  Thirty seconds and plug the Resistance Manifesto, sir.
[01:09:40.455 --> 01:09:41.516]  And that's your website?
[01:09:42.277 --> 01:09:42.997]  It's the book.
[01:09:43.197 --> 01:09:46.179]  It's the ResistanceManifesto.com is the website.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.021]  And it is a book.
[01:09:48.181 --> 01:09:49.542]  It's going to be about 400 pages.
[01:09:49.622 --> 01:09:51.543]  It will be released next month.
[01:09:52.064 --> 01:09:54.966]  And it is the Resistance Manifesto.
[01:09:54.986 --> 01:09:58.228]  The Manifesto of the Global Resistance.
[01:09:58.248 --> 01:10:05.153]  And while your films are tremendous in an incredible way to get the word out and fight the globalists and expose the New World Order,
[01:10:05.703 --> 01:10:32.129]  The manifesto goes into creating the New World Order, the satanic elements within it, the ideologies, the philosophies, and then it gets into the neural interfaces, the Orwellian aspects of the New World Order that are going to be coming into the next 10 or 15 years, and you've been talking about the neural interfaces and the transhumanist movement and all these things, and it is just time, and we're recruiting soldiers just like yourself,
[01:10:32.805 --> 01:10:35.547]  If you're interested, log on to TheResistanceManifesto.com.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:08.687]  Hi Alex, a couple of things I wanted to see if maybe you could confirm or disconfirm I've been hearing about.
[01:11:09.828 --> 01:11:11.929]  An uncle of mine lives in Arizona.
[01:11:11.949 --> 01:11:20.053]  He told my mother about a month ago that he's been seeing an awful lot of people crossing the border because they see them all the time that actually don't look Mexican, they look
[01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:24.391]  They looked from the Middle East, and he says he's kind of getting worried about it.
[01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:35.593]  We should watch the news, and I've been hearing him talking about decent enough putting guys down there to watch the border, but I haven't heard anything about them seeing anybody that looked Middle Eastern.
[01:11:35.753 --> 01:11:36.833]  Have you heard anything like that?
[01:11:36.953 --> 01:11:39.334]  Yeah, let me just go over the facts for you.
[01:11:39.374 --> 01:11:41.595]  Do you want to get this answer on air or off air?
[01:11:43.555 --> 01:11:43.755]  Sir?
[01:11:45.815 --> 01:11:47.936]  Do you want this answer on air or off air, KC?
[01:11:50.295 --> 01:11:52.056]  We'll let him go then.
[01:11:54.898 --> 01:12:14.649]  Well, there's probably been, I don't know, 30-40 mainstream news articles the last six months of Syrians with terrorist connections, Iranians, people from Sudan, you name it, they have caught, what, last year alone, 3,000
[01:12:16.758 --> 01:12:20.020]  Arabic Muslims coming across the Texas border alone.
[01:12:21.581 --> 01:12:22.801]  And they don't even deport them.
[01:12:23.181 --> 01:12:24.742]  Once they're here, they just release them.
[01:12:25.403 --> 01:12:26.883]  Even the Border Patrol happens to catch them.
[01:12:28.304 --> 01:12:32.967]  They had an attempted hijacking shortly after 9-11 in Arizona at a little airport there.
[01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:37.889]  That was in local newspapers, but the local airport owners were told to shut up about it.
[01:12:40.671 --> 01:12:44.212]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands, what is it, 6,000 people
[01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:57.481]  6,000 Arabs were caught coming across in 2003, don't have the numbers yet for 2004, in Cochise County alone, where 3 million illegal aliens come across each year.
[01:12:58.461 --> 01:12:59.541]  They go back and forth.
[01:13:00.121 --> 01:13:14.644]  They're in Cochise County, Arizona, and that's where the Minutemen are, about 1,200 strong American citizens, and now over 30 aircraft flying the border, simply calling Border Patrol and telling them to do their job.
[01:13:15.885 --> 01:13:43.170]  And Bush, two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago, called them vigilantes, called them bad people, and all they're doing is sitting on private ranches and in national parks and state lands, where citizens are allowed to go, and videotaping and with cell phones, sitting up on platforms, and calling the Border Patrol and saying, come do your job.
[01:13:44.679 --> 01:13:59.910]  And they're doing this along the border in Cochise County, the biggest hot spot in the country, though California's bad, the Texas border's bad, the New Mexico border's bad, but it's really bad there in Arizona.
[01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:07.196]  And the Mexican government puts out manuals of how to get into the U.S., how to vote, how to take the country over.
[01:14:09.766 --> 01:14:27.358]  uh... is a hispanic Ku Klux Klan group says they're going to kill all the white people I've got their manuals with images of M-16s and cutting white people's heads off and murdering us and they've got all the big fortune 500 people giving them millions of dollars.
[01:14:27.438 --> 01:14:37.405]  La Raza isn't quite as bad but their group means the race and they say if you don't like it get out and this is going to be a place for Mexicans
[01:14:38.314 --> 01:14:40.595]  I mean, imagine if a white organization tried this.
[01:14:40.675 --> 01:14:44.096]  And by the way, Mexico, it was a bunch of scrub brush.
[01:14:44.156 --> 01:14:45.197]  Nobody wanted this.
[01:14:45.637 --> 01:14:46.817]  The French couldn't keep it.
[01:14:46.877 --> 01:14:47.718]  Then you had it.
[01:14:50.439 --> 01:15:00.182]  Santa Ana invited the Kentuckians and others and the Tennesseans in because your people couldn't keep it from the Comanches.
[01:15:01.343 --> 01:15:03.244]  And my ancestors could.
[01:15:03.264 --> 01:15:06.425]  Even though some of my ancestors were Native American.
[01:15:09.993 --> 01:15:10.934]  That's what really happened.
[01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:12.175]  You don't own this land.
[01:15:13.597 --> 01:15:15.659]  If anybody does, it's the Native Americans.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.023]  They're the true indigenous people, so just shut up.
[01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:21.424]  I'm sick of it.
[01:15:22.786 --> 01:15:26.930]  There wasn't a magic Aztec kingdom in the Guadalupe Mountains, as you claim.
[01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:29.052]  I mean, it is just crazy.
[01:15:29.804 --> 01:15:31.125]  It's totally insane.
[01:15:31.505 --> 01:15:33.406]  But big money funds all this.
[01:15:33.466 --> 01:15:42.312]  So, the government's saying, and all CIA has snuck across the border, they're going to attack schools and shopping malls in the Southwest.
[01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:44.053]  Give up all your rights.
[01:15:44.113 --> 01:15:57.302]  We need metal detectors in all the schools, and in all the malls, and armed guards everywhere, and you'll have to have an RFID in your driver's license, which they're now about to pass, to scan you when you walk in,
[01:15:58.442 --> 01:16:01.845]  And kind of a passive system to make sure you're allowed in the mall.
[01:16:01.906 --> 01:16:04.628]  I mean, this is being proposed by the FBI last year.
[01:16:05.529 --> 01:16:16.560]  But the border, when Congress added an additional 2,000 border patrol just to replace what left to go be air marshals where they get a lot more money each year, $24,000 a year increase in pay starting,
[01:16:20.283 --> 01:16:23.345]  Bush said, nope, nope, we're not giving that money for Border Patrol.
[01:16:23.385 --> 01:16:24.465]  We don't need more Border Patrol.
[01:16:24.906 --> 01:16:26.867]  They want a third world population.
[01:16:27.187 --> 01:16:38.413]  So, for all the Hispanics who have gotten really aggressive, militant, clan-ish, I would say, and I've bullhorned the Ku Klux Klan, and I've bullhorned you.
[01:16:38.813 --> 01:16:43.656]  I've bullhorned Mecha, and I've bullhorned the Klan, and I've bullhorned Vicente Fox, and I'll bullhorn you.
[01:16:44.236 --> 01:16:44.916]  You're racist!
[01:16:46.837 --> 01:16:47.718]  I just want to point out,
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.662]  That your groups are funded by the major Fortune 500.
[01:16:51.783 --> 01:16:53.624]  I mean nobody gets funding like you.
[01:16:54.265 --> 01:16:56.527]  Now why are a bunch of old white men funding you?
[01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:59.469]  Because they hate this country and they're going to break it down.
[01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:08.396]  You can have your pride salved or you can join the real resistance against the New World Order and none of us will be peons.
[01:17:09.017 --> 01:17:12.240]  Or we can all be peons like the poor slaves in Mexico.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:16.103]  So my hand is out to you if you want to break your conditioning and join me.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:17.821]  Right next to me.
[01:17:17.881 --> 01:17:18.681]  Don't get behind me.
[01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:19.542]  Get right next to me.
[01:17:20.262 --> 01:17:23.265]  And I will embrace you in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:17:23.345 --> 01:17:27.287]  Or you can be a bunch of idiots and you can go along with what you're doing.
[01:17:28.468 --> 01:17:28.788]  Okay?
[01:17:28.848 --> 01:17:30.790]  I'm sorry that the Texans beat you.
[01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:37.554]  I'm sorry you've got some 175, 180 year old pride thing going.
[01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:39.836]  Okay?
[01:17:39.896 --> 01:17:40.777]  It doesn't matter.
[01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:42.558]  Santa Ana was a dictator.
[01:17:42.578 --> 01:17:43.799]  You later overthrew him.
[01:17:45.595 --> 01:17:48.958]  Okay, and I know Mexicans weren't treated perfectly in this country.
[01:17:48.978 --> 01:17:50.819]  Well, you're not treated perfectly in your own country.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.322]  Let's all stand up for everybody's rights.
[01:17:54.162 --> 01:17:54.563]  Alright?
[01:17:55.063 --> 01:17:58.646]  You can either be used as a tool of the new world order, or we can save this country together.
[01:17:59.767 --> 01:18:00.888]  Just don't be stupid.
[01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:04.691]  Alright, we'll break.
[01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:10.416]  I'm going to come back with news about the national draft, Pope John Paul II, the latest Terry Schiavo information.
[01:18:10.456 --> 01:18:11.617]  It just gets worse and worse.
[01:18:12.253 --> 01:18:13.454]  We won't let him go to the funeral.
[01:18:13.474 --> 01:18:14.675]  We're going to have a secret funeral.
[01:18:15.095 --> 01:18:16.577]  Michael Schiavo is a piece of work.
[01:18:17.117 --> 01:18:18.959]  And then we'll go to KC.
[01:18:19.239 --> 01:18:23.542]  We'll go to Michael, Charlie, and many others.
[01:18:23.582 --> 01:18:24.643]  Toll free number to join us.
[01:18:24.663 --> 01:18:26.025]  Always a good idea to give that number out.
[01:18:26.045 --> 01:18:27.306]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:27.326 --> 01:18:27.386]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:35.274 --> 01:18:38.977]  And the websites, again, are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:18:39.377 --> 01:18:41.959]  My new film, Martial Law, is now out on DVD.
[01:18:42.599 --> 01:18:44.681]  It is a little over three hours long.
[01:18:44.741 --> 01:18:45.602]  It's my best work.
[01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:48.103]  And it's a great deal, so get it today.
[01:18:48.864 --> 01:18:49.705]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:50.145]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:54.752]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:54.832 --> 01:18:59.614]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:59.794 --> 01:19:07.596]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:07.856 --> 01:19:13.218]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:13.438 --> 01:19:20.420]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:26.044]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:31.047]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:19:31.387 --> 01:19:38.992]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:19:39.333 --> 01:19:44.796]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:19:45.877 --> 01:19:49.400]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:50.300]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.603]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:54.983 --> 01:20:00.707]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:20:00.967 --> 01:20:06.051]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:20:06.431 --> 01:20:15.739]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:21.024]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:20:21.344 --> 01:20:25.348]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:20:25.568 --> 01:20:30.252]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:36.639]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:20:36.939 --> 01:20:43.167]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:43.207 --> 01:20:44.188]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:44.268 --> 01:20:45.449]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.551 --> 01:20:56.032]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.732 --> 01:21:03.375]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:21:04.536 --> 01:21:06.836]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:21:07.637 --> 01:21:13.879]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:22.843]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:21:23.886 --> 01:21:31.751]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:21:32.612 --> 01:21:34.153]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.173 --> 01:21:34.533]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.553 --> 01:21:35.033]  Call now.
[01:21:35.053 --> 01:21:39.036]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:53.527 --> 01:21:56.770]  I was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:58.211]  Thank you, Cartovite.
[01:21:58.271 --> 01:22:03.296]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cartovite, that's all changed now.
[01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:06.899]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cartovite.
[01:22:06.959 --> 01:22:08.920]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[01:22:08.941 --> 01:22:09.961]  Cartovite.
[01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:11.543]  We all use Cartovite!
[01:22:12.418 --> 01:22:15.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[01:22:32.792 --> 01:22:33.892]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[01:22:42.278 --> 01:22:47.982]  Alright, Mike, Charlie, Ed, Tim, Rick, everybody, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:22:48.142 --> 01:22:51.144]  I'm going to plunge back into the news now, though.
[01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:13.719]  This is out of the Arizona Republic.
[01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.640]  We've got this guy coming on Wednesday.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.421]  One of the experts they're quoting here.
[01:23:18.501 --> 01:23:22.342]  Draft may be needed in a year, military analysts warn.
[01:23:22.462 --> 01:23:27.263]  So, they shut up the draft boards again, doubled the funding for Selective Service.
[01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:30.564]  All the Pentagon experts are saying they need a draft.
[01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:35.125]  They've got the bills introduced on both sides of the aisle in both the House and Senate.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.122]  But it is listed as an urban legend by the Urban Legend website.
[01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:43.744]  Just like government ever being corrupt is listed as an urban legend.
[01:23:44.064 --> 01:23:45.304]  No, government's only good.
[01:23:46.945 --> 01:23:51.247]  And conspiracies don't exist, even though there's thousands of people charged every year with conspiracy.
[01:23:52.348 --> 01:23:54.129]  But they have to have a draft.
[01:23:54.489 --> 01:24:02.173]  And that'll come after the convenient terror attack, and then, Well, I thought we'd never need it, but we better go ahead and do it to buy Al-Qaeda!
[01:24:03.113 --> 01:24:04.454]  But the border had to stay wide open.
[01:24:06.366 --> 01:24:08.787]  And, uh, but meanwhile there's all these editorials.
[01:24:08.847 --> 01:24:11.868]  I mean, every day or two I see an editorial while we need a draft.
[01:24:11.928 --> 01:24:13.028]  But, it doesn't exist!
[01:24:13.488 --> 01:24:17.530]  Uh, uh, we need one, but if you, but, but, this is psychological warfare.
[01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:19.770]  Then when we resist, they go, it doesn't exist.
[01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:20.250]  Shut up.
[01:24:21.951 --> 01:24:29.613]  If American forces aren't pulling out of Iraq in a year, a draft will be needed to meet manpower requirements, military analysts warned Wednesday.
[01:24:30.414 --> 01:24:33.555]  With recruitment lagging and no end in sight for U.S.
[01:24:33.595 --> 01:24:34.655]  forces in Iraq,
[01:24:35.365 --> 01:24:51.675]  The breaking point for the nation's all-volunteer military will be mid-06, and if they invade Iran and Syria, it'll be now, agreed Lawrence Korb, a draft opponent and assistant defense secretary in the Reagan administration.
[01:24:53.096 --> 01:24:57.398]  And Philip Carter, a conscription advocate and former army captain.
[01:24:57.999 --> 01:24:59.860]  We've got Mr. Carter coming on.
[01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:13.516]  America's all-volunteer military simply cannot deploy and sustain enough troops to succeed in places like Iraq while still deterring threats elsewhere in the world, Carter announced in the March issue of the Washington Monthly.
[01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:22.221]  Korb is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank and senior advisor to the Center for Defense Information.
[01:25:22.281 --> 01:25:26.623]  Carter is an attorney who writes on military affairs for the Slate.com and other media.
[01:25:27.345 --> 01:25:30.564]  They debated at a symposium on the draft last Wednesday.
[01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:38.627]  While conceding at the Army, Marines, and National Guard and Army Reserves, the branches serving mostly in Iraq face recruitment difficulties.
[01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:45.210]  Military officials have denied any plans to revive the draft, which was replaced by an all-volunteer force in 1973.
[01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:53.354]  The D-word is the farthest thing from my thoughts, Army Secretary Francis Harvey said at the Pentagon Press Briefing last week.
[01:25:53.755 --> 01:26:00.298]  He said the all-volunteer force has proven its value and applauded the performance of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:15.268]  But Secretary of Defense, Little Minion, a few years ago, White, Secretary of the Army, said they needed a draft and needed 400,000 plus troops to do the right job in Iraq.
[01:26:17.029 --> 01:26:20.251]  And they're beating the drum to invade Iran and Syria every day.
[01:26:21.792 --> 01:26:22.973]  How are they going to do that?
[01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:28.856]  And it's unbelievable.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:33.303]  When you get over there, there's no difference between the active and the reserves of the National Guard.
[01:26:33.323 --> 01:26:34.764]  The quality is high across the board.
[01:26:34.804 --> 01:26:35.885]  It's seamless, he said.
[01:26:36.385 --> 01:26:44.591]  During his re-election campaign, President Bush declared flatly that he would not reinstate the draft and that there is little support for conscription on Capitol Hill.
[01:26:45.732 --> 01:26:54.578]  Today, no leading politician in either party will come anywhere near the idea, the first having replaced Social Security as the third rail of American politics, wrote Carter.
[01:26:55.299 --> 01:27:01.402]  However, the analyst said that the all-volunteer army is on the verge of breaking under current circumstances.
[01:27:01.782 --> 01:27:11.707]  The 3rd Infantry Division, based in Fort Stewart, Georgia, and the 4th Infantry Division, based in Fort Hood, Texas, are among the units that are being sent back for a second tour in Iraq.
[01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:15.929]  And of course, the National Guard, historically, is in country.
[01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:18.611]  They've told them two-year service isn't enough.
[01:27:18.631 --> 01:27:20.892]  They're going to be looking at four-year service.
[01:27:21.949 --> 01:27:26.413]  Which nobody psychologically, in the aggregate, no army can handle that.
[01:27:27.214 --> 01:27:33.679]  Shifting gears to the real threat to sovereignty, Senate opens door to alien amnesty.
[01:27:34.039 --> 01:27:34.680]  Wonder why?
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.504]  The Senate is bracing for its first fight over amnesty.
[01:27:40.725 --> 01:27:42.186]  No one's for it, but they don't care.
[01:27:42.206 --> 01:27:50.113]  For illegal immigrants, in nearly ten years after the chamber's parliamentarian ruled that a debate over granting legal status to illegal
[01:27:50.868 --> 01:27:54.513]  Agricultural workers will be allowed on the pending emergency spending bill.
[01:27:55.254 --> 01:27:57.657]  And it doesn't have to do with agricultural workers.
[01:27:57.737 --> 01:28:01.241]  It says anybody who's been here can then just suddenly become legal.
[01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.843]  That's what Bush wants.
[01:28:02.943 --> 01:28:03.244]  Amnesty.
[01:28:03.829 --> 01:28:07.652]  The $81 billion spending bill covers costs associated with the war on terror.
[01:28:07.672 --> 01:28:10.414]  Yeah, it gives you a national ID card, but not for the illegals.
[01:28:10.834 --> 01:28:16.358]  And the House already passed a version with provisions restricting asylum claims and cracking down on illegal immigrants.
[01:28:16.898 --> 01:28:18.179]  Ability to get driver's license.
[01:28:18.619 --> 01:28:21.181]  Again, you read that and it sounds good, it doesn't really do that.
[01:28:22.122 --> 01:28:26.905]  It makes it easier for them to get driver's license, as Ron Paul has said, but makes it harder for citizens.
[01:28:28.363 --> 01:28:31.765]  And it allows illegals to get driver's licenses, hence legalizing them.
[01:28:32.065 --> 01:28:36.507]  So I guess in a double-think way, it does crack down on illegals by making them all legal.
[01:28:37.108 --> 01:28:38.608]  That does kind of fix the problem.
[01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:40.690]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:42.090]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.051 --> 01:28:44.972]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.432 --> 01:28:47.053]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.073 --> 01:28:50.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.238 --> 01:29:01.761]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.161 --> 01:29:06.384]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.624 --> 01:29:13.628]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.028 --> 01:29:20.132]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:21.513]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:24.775]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.935 --> 01:29:26.977]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.277 --> 01:29:34.521]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.822 --> 01:29:38.204]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:29:38.604 --> 01:29:41.766]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:29:41.786 --> 01:29:41.826]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.846 --> 01:29:41.886]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.126 --> 01:29:43.046]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.066 --> 01:29:43.266]  Call today.
[01:29:53.965 --> 01:29:55.565]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.725 --> 01:29:59.806]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.966 --> 01:30:02.827]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.907 --> 01:30:09.649]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.809 --> 01:30:12.829]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.029 --> 01:30:15.410]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:23.432]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:23.732 --> 01:30:35.035]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.175 --> 01:30:42.797]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:43.117]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.157 --> 01:30:45.117]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:57.323]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[01:30:57.523 --> 01:31:00.224]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[01:31:00.424 --> 01:31:01.804]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[01:31:01.984 --> 01:31:11.867]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[01:31:12.107 --> 01:31:13.848]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[01:31:14.128 --> 01:31:18.009]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:22.651]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:31:22.851 --> 01:31:26.672]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[01:31:26.932 --> 01:31:33.094]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:31:33.314 --> 01:31:36.035]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[01:31:36.295 --> 01:31:39.620]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle one-year money-back guarantee.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.586]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[01:31:43.726 --> 01:31:44.928]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:31:45.088 --> 01:31:45.509]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:32:02.515 --> 01:32:03.275]  We're liberty.
[01:32:03.495 --> 01:32:06.356]  For their descendants.
[01:32:06.396 --> 01:32:12.458]  I want to say thank you to our founding fathers.
[01:32:15.159 --> 01:32:18.941]  All those that sacrificed that we could have some semblance
[01:32:32.303 --> 01:32:37.587]  The people that attack America can point out that this country isn't perfect.
[01:32:39.108 --> 01:32:46.514]  They can point out that, well, you know, America has violated people's rights and freedoms.
[01:32:46.614 --> 01:32:48.295]  Yes, but we were the ideal
[01:32:49.569 --> 01:32:56.535]  Uh, that then spread across the world to try to restrict enslavement and feudal serfdom.
[01:32:57.036 --> 01:33:00.239]  Now it's being replaced under new terms, new names.
[01:33:00.759 --> 01:33:08.386]  But bottom line, we have a global corporate elite that has not free-marketed and socialized the population to get us domesticated.
[01:33:08.866 --> 01:33:10.488]  Now that things have been socialized,
[01:33:11.008 --> 01:33:29.679]  Private corporations are taking on government responsibilities and government ownership of these institutions that we've paid for and built, and are basically now removing our liberties and freedoms, and calling it security, calling it safety, calling it paying your fair share.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:32.961]  And it's all completely transparent.
[01:33:33.001 --> 01:33:34.202]  It's all a fraud.
[01:33:35.202 --> 01:33:38.184]  I mean, give up your liberty because the terrorists are about to attack you?
[01:33:38.815 --> 01:33:40.476]  But meanwhile, the borders are wide open.
[01:33:40.496 --> 01:33:42.498]  I mean, how much more transparent does this have to get?
[01:33:42.998 --> 01:33:46.841]  We're going to go to Michael and Charlie and Ed and Tim and Rick and others here in a second.
[01:33:48.162 --> 01:33:50.364]  I do want to get into the Pope calls for a New World Order.
[01:33:50.384 --> 01:33:54.247]  I wanted to go back over some of the things that Pope John Paul said and did.
[01:33:54.347 --> 01:33:55.328]  Pope John Paul II.
[01:33:55.968 --> 01:33:59.271]  Also, screened audiences fake news promote Bush agenda.
[01:33:59.691 --> 01:34:00.452]  More on that.
[01:34:00.472 --> 01:34:01.032]  Some good news.
[01:34:01.092 --> 01:34:04.615]  Montana Legislature issues strong rebuke of Patriot Act.
[01:34:05.376 --> 01:34:10.577]  Terri Schiavo autopsy photos, that is fake ones, circulate on the internet.
[01:34:11.538 --> 01:34:12.638]  Quite grisly.
[01:34:13.558 --> 01:34:20.620]  And more news on these robotic soldiers, the Army is developing this, out of the Associated Press, that and a lot more.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:32.903]  Before I go back to your calls, my new film, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, the full title, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[01:34:34.122 --> 01:34:36.063]  And it's really three films in one.
[01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:44.187]  The latest police state developments, the hover blimps, the sound cannons, the police in the black uniforms, arresting reporters and peaceful protesters.
[01:34:44.728 --> 01:34:46.128]  That's the first 35 minutes.
[01:34:46.148 --> 01:34:51.651]  We then spend an hour on 9-11 and what really happened, detailing how the globalists carried the attacks out.
[01:34:52.211 --> 01:34:59.055]  Then we spend an hour looking at the philosophy, the ideology of the globalists, the Bush-Nazi connection, the Arnold-Nazi connection.
[01:35:00.796 --> 01:35:02.178]  It's just so much, folks.
[01:35:02.598 --> 01:35:04.160]  So much powerful info.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.342]  It's the best video I've ever made.
[01:35:06.822 --> 01:35:08.123]  Three hours long.
[01:35:08.283 --> 01:35:08.944]  Three hours.
[01:35:08.964 --> 01:35:11.006]  A little over three hours on DVD.
[01:35:11.486 --> 01:35:14.049]  Two hours, thirty-five minutes on VHS.
[01:35:14.529 --> 01:35:16.090]  The film is now available.

[01:36:48.812 --> 01:36:50.934]  But I don't care if you share your passcode with a couple people.
[01:36:51.294 --> 01:36:53.716]  Just don't give it to everybody or I won't be able to afford the bandwidth.
[01:36:54.237 --> 01:36:56.939]  But you know, we've got four servers now running the websites.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:36:59.961]  Four big servers, by the way.
[01:37:02.163 --> 01:37:02.963]  Let's go to calls.
[01:37:04.424 --> 01:37:08.687]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Rhode Island.
[01:37:08.747 --> 01:37:09.268]  Welcome, sir.
[01:37:10.088 --> 01:37:11.970]  Alex, I'm gonna be right there on the line with you, brother.
[01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:14.238]  I just have two quick questions for you first.
[01:37:15.158 --> 01:37:17.278]  Number one is in regards to the Free State Project.
[01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:24.321]  I heard from a friend of mine, Tom, who also listens to your show, that you did not think New Hampshire would be a good candidate state for the project.
[01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:27.342]  If that's true, I'd like to hear a justification behind that.
[01:37:28.102 --> 01:37:29.882]  Number two is in regards to Neil Bort.
[01:37:30.483 --> 01:37:33.824]  I saw the conversation you had with him in New York City at Ground Zero.
[01:37:34.304 --> 01:37:36.945]  I'm just curious if you took him up on his offer to be on his show.
[01:37:36.965 --> 01:37:38.185]  He said he wouldn't hit you with a kill switch.
[01:37:40.587 --> 01:37:46.352]  Yes, I did email Neil Bortz, and he never emailed back, but I don't think that's because he's dishonest.
[01:37:46.372 --> 01:37:51.576]  He probably didn't read the email, and I really don't have time to chase hosts down to go on their radio shows.
[01:37:52.436 --> 01:37:58.301]  And for those that haven't seen the Neil Bortz confrontation, that's not in the film, though it's on the web.
[01:37:59.342 --> 01:38:03.905]  Neil Bortz is a big talk show host, probably the, I don't know, 12th largest show in the country.
[01:38:03.925 --> 01:38:04.726]  I think he's listed as
[01:38:05.812 --> 01:38:12.798]  And I'm at Ground Zero, and there's Neil Bortz kind of laughing at me in the distance, so I walk over to him, and I go, OK, defend your ideas on 9-11.
[01:38:12.898 --> 01:38:17.462]  He goes, no, pay me $2,000 an hour, and I will talk to you.
[01:38:18.323 --> 01:38:19.964]  And I said, well, you can't defend your ideas.
[01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:22.046]  Then I talked about something else, and he was happy to talk.
[01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:28.232]  And I just showed how he's another phony conservative, and it's an interesting piece of
[01:38:29.261 --> 01:38:30.002]  A piece of video.
[01:38:30.042 --> 01:38:33.063]  And I brought up Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[01:38:33.103 --> 01:38:37.226]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks, and he didn't want to talk about it.
[01:38:38.907 --> 01:38:41.388]  In regards to the Free State Project?
[01:38:41.808 --> 01:38:58.238]  You know, it was probably ten months ago that I was talking about Free State Project, and I don't, I don't fully like the views of it, and I think getting everybody to move to one state is a dangerous precedent, and I was saying the East Coast is too
[01:38:59.085 --> 01:38:59.746]  Populous.
[01:38:59.886 --> 01:39:02.247]  I don't know if I said New Hampshire wouldn't be a good candidate.
[01:39:02.267 --> 01:39:14.115]  I don't know what piece of info I was looking at at the time, but New Hampshire has Clause 10 in its state constitution called Right to Revolt, and the week before 9-11,
[01:39:15.786 --> 01:39:30.696]  I was having a train of selectmen, mayors on, and the majority of the cities were about to vote to pull out of the union because of quote, the New World Order and land rights issues, which I think is a great idea.
[01:39:30.737 --> 01:39:39.903]  I think a few states pulling out to threaten the New World Order, to show people how serious this is, and it can happen by the way folks, it's very popular.
[01:39:41.276 --> 01:39:42.137]  I think it should happen.
[01:39:42.637 --> 01:39:49.025]  Not in the context of the Southwest, though, becoming kind of a hegemon of Latin America, which the globalists plan.
[01:39:49.045 --> 01:40:00.878]  I'm talking about Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, New Hampshire, Vermont pulling out, and perhaps selectively, under the Constitution, even still paying taxes,
[01:40:01.776 --> 01:40:16.714]  Uh, but saying we don't follow your interstate commerce, uh, we don't go along with these wars, uh, you know, basically re-upping their state sovereignty to a limited secession, which is what we had under the 13 colonies, uh, was, it was independent states.
[01:40:17.683 --> 01:40:20.004]  Uh, you know, as part of a commission, really.
[01:40:20.024 --> 01:40:22.805]  Uh, and I don't know, I think New Hampshire would be excellent.
[01:40:22.925 --> 01:40:28.847]  I don't know why I said that at the time, but I disagree with the Alex Jones of ten months ago, uh, if that is the case.
[01:40:28.927 --> 01:40:29.387]  Anything else?
[01:40:29.587 --> 01:40:33.129]  Yeah, the only thing I have to say in defense of the Free State Project is it's not moving everyone.
[01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:37.010]  There's 20,000 liberty activists and we have to fight this thing one state at a time.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.541]  My idea of liberty isn't aborting children.
[01:40:40.581 --> 01:40:44.143]  My idea of liberty isn't injecting heroin.
[01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:49.105]  I am for drug decriminalization because the globalists who deal with drugs want to legal jack up prices.
[01:40:49.646 --> 01:40:51.046]  And there are libertarians for life.
[01:40:51.326 --> 01:40:54.168]  There's a libertarian sect that is very pro-life.
[01:40:54.188 --> 01:40:59.150]  No, I know, but the Libertarian Party is run by liberal infiltrators, thanks for the call.
[01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:02.031]  And again, you can call me libertarian on many views.
[01:41:03.112 --> 01:41:05.573]  So many of the libertarians of the four
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:08.982]  That the front right now are just despicable creatures.
[01:41:09.882 --> 01:41:13.804]  Let's go ahead now and take another call here.
[01:41:15.365 --> 01:41:17.026]  Charlie and Mass, you're on the air.
[01:41:17.066 --> 01:41:17.526]  Go ahead.
[01:41:18.387 --> 01:41:22.709]  Yeah, I just want to make a few comments about the Pope.
[01:41:22.849 --> 01:41:26.871]  Like you and many of your listeners, I don't have a problem with Catholic people, obviously.
[01:41:27.572 --> 01:41:31.694]  But like with any other globalist institution, the problem emanates from the top.
[01:41:33.091 --> 01:41:33.952]  Well, it's just history.
[01:41:33.992 --> 01:41:39.977]  With any big, complex, wealthy organization, power corrupts absolutely.
[01:41:40.738 --> 01:41:43.340]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:41:44.461 --> 01:41:46.042]  That's how entropy works.
[01:41:46.162 --> 01:41:48.484]  Anything big tends to become corrupt.
[01:41:48.504 --> 01:41:49.344]  Look at our own government.
[01:41:49.885 --> 01:41:50.385]  Exactly.
[01:41:50.806 --> 01:41:55.189]  And, you know, going back to John Paul I, who served, what, for like a month or something.
[01:41:55.750 --> 01:42:00.053]  I'm not saying that this last pope was involved in his death, but there's no question it's been well documented.
[01:42:00.073 --> 01:42:01.154]  The man was murdered.
[01:42:02.391 --> 01:42:04.253]  He was planning on... Yeah, he was Italian.
[01:42:04.913 --> 01:42:11.659]  Yeah, and he had stated that one of the things he wanted to accomplish in his pontificate was to clean up the Vatican Bank, for example.
[01:42:11.699 --> 01:42:12.820]  He said there was a lot of corruption.
[01:42:14.141 --> 01:42:18.084]  And he also said that he planned to pretty much keep the church to itself.
[01:42:18.104 --> 01:42:23.269]  He didn't want it to be involved in politics or in other churches' matters.
[01:42:23.289 --> 01:42:25.190]  You know, in other words, he wasn't... Ecumenical.
[01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.391]  Ecumenical, right, right.
[01:42:26.751 --> 01:42:29.814]  And that's not the direction that they wanted the church to go, obviously.
[01:42:32.115 --> 01:42:35.916]  Last Pope who just died, John Paul II, obviously met that criteria.
[01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:37.496]  So it's someone they wanted in there.
[01:42:37.516 --> 01:42:40.077]  Yeah, that's why he was in the office for 26 years.
[01:42:40.517 --> 01:42:48.179]  Right, and the thing I wanted to point out is he was every bit as much a globalist as the leaders of our country in England.
[01:42:48.679 --> 01:42:50.619]  He was also a supporter of the UN.
[01:42:50.719 --> 01:42:53.880]  You probably remember back in the early 90s, Robert Mueller.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.980]  Yeah, 1996 he had the trip to the US to celebrate the UN.
[01:42:57.321 --> 01:42:58.781]  Right, he actually spoke at the UN too.
[01:43:00.221 --> 01:43:05.202]  Well, I'm not going to get into, especially after the guy just died, I'm not going to get into... Well, let me just comment.
[01:43:05.622 --> 01:43:16.804]  I'm not going to get into a bashing fest here, because Protestants have their own, you know, let's get the 2x4 out of our own eye before we... But certainly, he sent out mixed signals.
[01:43:16.844 --> 01:43:25.846]  I mean, he was pro-New World Order, but at the same time he was against the Iraq War, but that's probably more... I'm going to get a real expert on this,
[01:43:26.957 --> 01:43:31.959]  And I know Hutton Gibson's like the head of the Catholic organization that tries to keep the older values in.
[01:43:32.259 --> 01:43:34.719]  I'm going to get Hutton on the show if I'm able to.
[01:43:34.739 --> 01:43:35.860]  I haven't talked to Hutton in months.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:37.720]  Plus, I want to say hi to Hutton.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:38.781]  I know he's a regular listener.
[01:43:38.941 --> 01:43:42.782]  If he's in town, I want to say, you know, listen to the local station in West Virginia.
[01:43:42.802 --> 01:43:45.343]  I want to say hi to Hutton and crew.
[01:43:45.883 --> 01:43:47.723]  And I do want to get Hutton on.
[01:43:48.464 --> 01:43:49.744]  Oh yeah, he'd be great for this.
[01:43:50.104 --> 01:43:55.946]  I just wanted to point out, there's an article here, I'm looking at it from CNN's website, January 1st of last year.
[01:43:56.681 --> 01:43:59.583]  And it just says, the title of it was, Pope Calls for a New World Order.
[01:44:00.343 --> 01:44:12.590]  And the first paragraph ends with this statement that the Pope calls for respect for international law and the creation of a new world order based on the goals of the United Nations.
[01:44:12.610 --> 01:44:13.370]  No, I know.
[01:44:13.871 --> 01:44:14.251]  I hear you.
[01:44:14.291 --> 01:44:15.471]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:15.972 --> 01:44:18.533]  This is from Associated Press, March 9th, 2005.
[01:44:18.613 --> 01:44:19.934]  And so they have re-
[01:44:26.374 --> 01:44:29.737]  Reposted this, because he said it about a year before that.
[01:44:30.217 --> 01:44:33.080]  He said it on January 1st, 2004.
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:46.070]  Pope John Paul II rang in the New Year Thursday with a renewed call for peace in the Middle East and Africa and the creation of a new world order based on respect for the dignity of man and equality among nations.
[01:44:47.491 --> 01:44:50.073]  John Paul presided over the morning mass at St.
[01:44:50.114 --> 01:44:54.117]  Peter's Basilica to mark the World Day of Peace.
[01:44:55.549 --> 01:44:55.950]  We're good to go.
[01:45:10.706 --> 01:45:23.569]  John Paul directed his thoughts to continuing conflicts around the globe, but he stressed that to bring about peace there needs to be a new respect for international law and the creation of a new international order based on the goals of the United Nations.
[01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:35.451]  He called for an order that is able to give adequate solutions to today's problems based on the dignity of a human being, on an integral development of society and solidarity among nations rich and poor, i.e.
[01:45:35.471 --> 01:45:36.011]  global tax,
[01:45:36.671 --> 01:45:38.273]  On the sharing of resources, i.e.
[01:45:38.293 --> 01:45:42.296]  global tax, and extraordinary results of scientific and technical progress.
[01:45:45.118 --> 01:45:46.960]  So, I mean, we're just telling it like it is here.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:52.644]  And, again, I knew this would be brought up because, you know, he died Friday night is what we have been told.
[01:45:52.685 --> 01:45:55.367]  But we're saying he died Saturday night.
[01:45:55.387 --> 01:45:55.887]  It doesn't matter.
[01:45:57.168 --> 01:45:59.810]  And, um, I don't know.
[01:46:03.996 --> 01:46:07.958]  We're going to go back to Charlie and Tim and Rick here in just a second.
[01:46:09.439 --> 01:46:13.802]  I want to get to Screened Audiences Fake News Promote Bush Agenda.
[01:46:15.223 --> 01:46:17.024]  Then we'll come back in the next segment and take calls.
[01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.565]  This is out by Helen Thomas.
[01:46:20.846 --> 01:46:23.147]  Screened Audiences Fake News Promote Bush Agenda.
[01:46:23.167 --> 01:46:25.428]  And I know we talk about this a lot, but it's a big deal, folks.
[01:46:25.969 --> 01:46:27.129]  This is how controlled things are.
[01:46:27.610 --> 01:46:32.853]  President George W. Bush has learned to use the bully pulpit that the government's powerful
[01:46:34.119 --> 01:46:40.599]  prerogative of all presidents, but this president has tried to tweak that power in ways that expand the definition of managed news.
[01:46:41.218 --> 01:46:43.900]  Let's start with his national campaign to change Social Security.
[01:46:44.361 --> 01:46:54.309]  As he travels around the nation to make his pitch that Social Security is in a crisis, the President is limiting his congregation to screened, sanitized audiences.
[01:46:54.929 --> 01:46:59.373]  Why does he sermonize on the subject only to carefully selected audiences?
[01:46:59.833 --> 01:47:04.297]  They go arrest people who have anti-Bush stickers in the crowd, but they advertise it as open to the public.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:09.344]  These are people who are vetted to make sure they agree with the President's views.
[01:47:09.845 --> 01:47:18.353]  If they pass the test, the local Republican Party or the group sponsoring the event then issue tickets to the so-called town meetings or conversations with the President.
[01:47:18.894 --> 01:47:25.620]  Asked why the President speaks only to his supporters, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said Bush's intention is to educate the people.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.462]  He probably meant indoctrinate.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:32.043]  Is this the president of all the people, or just some of the people who agree with him?
[01:47:32.383 --> 01:47:34.645]  Yeah, I went and protested Bill Clinton many times.
[01:47:35.126 --> 01:47:35.886]  They let us do it.
[01:47:35.946 --> 01:47:36.507]  Now they don't.
[01:47:37.007 --> 01:47:37.748]  It's bizarre.
[01:47:37.788 --> 01:47:40.470]  He's preaching to the choir, hardly the way to educate the public.
[01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:47.976]  Controlling his audience was a prime goal of Bush's 2004 presidential campaign, but the anti-war protesters were barred from his public appearances.
[01:47:48.517 --> 01:47:51.259]  People who openly disagreed with him were hustled out of a hall.
[01:47:52.057 --> 01:48:02.084]  And we're now seeing the same audience control when Bush speaks out about Social Security, the Secret Service, and the White House aides apparently spend a lot of time trying to hand hook those permitted to hear him.
[01:48:02.424 --> 01:48:05.646]  They also call up business owners and say, don't have anti-Bush signs in your windows.
[01:48:06.366 --> 01:48:10.429]  Bush seems satisfied that he has made Social Security a worry to people.
[01:48:11.255 --> 01:48:14.517]  That's the goal of his sky-is-falling campaign.
[01:48:14.918 --> 01:48:24.084]  But the president is not ready to handle genuine dialogue on the subject or deal with those opposed to his plan to particularly privatize the government pension program.
[01:48:26.146 --> 01:48:32.010]  Every administration tries to manage the message that the news media convey to the public about presidential policies.
[01:48:32.737 --> 01:48:34.041]  problems and successes.
[01:48:34.542 --> 01:48:41.080]  But the Bush White House is pioneering new methods that steer the message management into outright government propaganda.
[01:48:41.644 --> 01:48:55.054]  The New York Times on March 13th published an in-depth report on how the administration is cranking up its public relations campaign to manipulate broadcast news by distributing prepackaged videos prepared by several federal agencies, including the Pentagon.
[01:48:55.515 --> 01:48:59.758]  These videos use phony reporters to tout the administration's position on major issues.
[01:49:00.078 --> 01:49:04.562]  Thinling staff TV stations are only too happy to receive the free videos.
[01:49:05.142 --> 01:49:06.083]  They're not free, folks.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:07.640]  They pay for them.
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:08.581]  Get it straight.
[01:49:09.021 --> 01:49:13.883]  Which they then pass along to viewers without any acknowledgment that the images and messages are government issued.
[01:49:14.483 --> 01:49:26.268]  Spokespersons for the major TV networks say they would never disseminate government prepared videos on their news broadcasts, but some financially strapped affiliates apparently are willing to error them without identifying the sources.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.324]  The government agencies say that it's up to broadcast stations to attribute the origin of the report if they meant to do so.
[01:49:32.864 --> 01:49:36.067]  The practice is far over the ethical line.
[01:49:36.507 --> 01:49:39.189]  Shame on both the government agencies and the TV stations.
[01:49:39.209 --> 01:49:47.074]  The Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Investigative Unit, has ruled that such government videos represent covert propaganda and are illegal.
[01:49:47.435 --> 01:49:48.696]  But Bush says, I don't care.
[01:49:49.076 --> 01:49:49.997]  I'm going to keep doing it.
[01:49:50.037 --> 01:49:50.517]  We'll be back.
[01:49:53.914 --> 01:49:58.258]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.418 --> 01:50:02.863]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.003 --> 01:50:07.387]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.427 --> 01:50:08.789]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.537 --> 01:50:10.517]  Panama!
[01:50:10.557 --> 01:50:14.779]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.839 --> 01:50:21.781]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.901 --> 01:50:23.962]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.142 --> 01:50:34.645]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.905 --> 01:50:37.446]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[01:50:37.506 --> 01:50:40.287]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[01:50:53.610 --> 01:50:58.836]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.976 --> 01:51:07.086]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.346 --> 01:51:14.394]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.574 --> 01:51:15.855]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.915 --> 01:51:21.820]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:27.104]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.204 --> 01:51:36.092]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.352 --> 01:51:39.654]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:57.849 --> 01:52:59.390]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:02.651]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.072 --> 01:53:06.593]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:06.993 --> 01:53:11.095]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:53:11.635 --> 01:53:13.576]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:53:15.357 --> 01:53:21.121]  Look, it's really simple.
[01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:24.363]  The globalists control almost all the major institutions.
[01:53:25.504 --> 01:53:28.666]  These institutions have little stage fights between themselves.
[01:53:29.307 --> 01:53:38.333]  They get you to put a label on yourself and your ideas, and then you switch off the thinking process and just get emotional like you're cheering on a football team.
[01:53:39.694 --> 01:53:42.775]  Our job is to get you to think outside the box and see the big picture.
[01:53:43.095 --> 01:53:45.096]  Does it give you more liberty or less liberty?
[01:53:46.197 --> 01:53:48.558]  That's how you look at government and institutions.
[01:53:50.158 --> 01:53:52.579]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:53:52.639 --> 01:53:56.201]  Tim in Ohio, then Rick, Sheldon, Chris, Ed, and others.
[01:53:56.261 --> 01:53:56.961]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:53:57.321 --> 01:53:57.661]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:58.182 --> 01:53:58.462]  Hello.
[01:53:58.662 --> 01:54:01.723]  I called you last week and I mentioned about the South Park episode.
[01:54:03.699 --> 01:54:06.740]  Where they basically make fun of Terry Shiloh Schindler?
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:08.360]  The whole situation, yeah.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:13.741]  The episode started out as a quest for a video game and a player.
[01:54:14.081 --> 01:54:17.021]  And of course, the little Kenny character always gets killed in that.
[01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:26.783]  They were about to... And the game was the final battle between Heaven and Hell, of all things cryptic.
[01:54:27.123 --> 01:54:31.444]  They showed Satan in Hell gathering his forces to attack Heaven.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.704]  The Satan was counseled by an old man in a black robe.
[01:54:37.725 --> 01:54:44.091]  And they had some really interesting things, and just like you say, they were trying to get people into this political box.
[01:54:44.131 --> 01:54:49.036]  They said, well, you know, they were wrong for all the right reasons, and we were right for all the wrong reasons.
[01:54:49.136 --> 01:54:53.060]  And the moral of the story was, they weren't playing God when they put the tube out.
[01:54:53.581 --> 01:54:57.382]  They were playing God when they put the tube in, which once again... So the devil was right?
[01:54:57.402 --> 01:54:58.302]  Did they take the tube out?
[01:54:58.582 --> 01:54:59.303]  Yeah, they took it out.
[01:54:59.603 --> 01:55:00.063]  Of course.
[01:55:00.103 --> 01:55:02.504]  And then the devil was bad, but he was doing good, though.
[01:55:03.044 --> 01:55:03.904]  It's unbelievable.
[01:55:05.424 --> 01:55:07.085]  Sounds like part of the course to me.
[01:55:07.685 --> 01:55:12.386]  And I think I mentioned to you last week just the timing of it, because you know how long it takes to put a show together.
[01:55:12.827 --> 01:55:17.468]  And for something like that, and they've been all advertised as new episodes.
[01:55:18.908 --> 01:55:28.151]  Well, I'm not an expert on South Park, but I think they can do those pretty quick because they just do paper cutouts and then the guys that created it voice it.
[01:55:28.411 --> 01:55:30.092]  Right, but we're talking about like 12 days, you know?
[01:55:30.152 --> 01:55:33.333]  And interesting, too, talking about that, what, the 13th day she died, she took the tube out?
[01:55:33.513 --> 01:55:35.794]  I think they knew, though, that they were going to be taking her tube out soon.
[01:55:37.148 --> 01:55:37.248]  Yes.
[01:55:37.268 --> 01:55:37.428]  Yes.
[01:55:54.702 --> 01:56:00.587]  Uh, right before she died, Boaz Lee, and they said that Michael Schiavo was clinging to her when she died.
[01:56:00.607 --> 01:56:09.394]  You know, I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but I'm just saying anyone clinging to a woman in her condition could have easily snuffed out whatever breathing she was trying to accomplish.
[01:56:10.115 --> 01:56:11.136]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:56:11.276 --> 01:56:18.742]  I mean, I'll tell ya, he won't let the family, she's gonna be buried outside Philadelphia, he won't let the family come to the funeral or know where she's gonna be buried.
[01:56:19.743 --> 01:56:21.264]  That's vicious.
[01:56:21.705 --> 01:56:22.906]  Wouldn't let them be in the room.
[01:56:24.151 --> 01:56:36.554]  And, uh, we have a sworn affidavit from a nurse that he would, uh, kick her out and then they'd come in and Terry'd be crying and her blood sugar would plunge to beneath the scale and that she believed he was injecting her with insulin.
[01:56:37.715 --> 01:56:38.195]  And that's it.
[01:56:38.215 --> 01:56:40.475]  And then here he is kicking everybody out and she dies.
[01:56:40.495 --> 01:56:41.496]  I don't know.
[01:56:42.096 --> 01:56:43.836]  Let's just ignore a sworn affidavit.
[01:56:44.717 --> 01:56:47.577]  Let me tell you, a nurse usually swears out an affidavit on you.
[01:56:47.978 --> 01:56:51.378]  You're going to have the cops investigating because that's a medical worker and you should.
[01:56:52.099 --> 01:56:53.119]  But not in this case.
[01:56:54.452 --> 01:56:55.272]  Not in this case.
[01:56:56.073 --> 01:56:57.673]  He's got friends in low places.
[01:56:59.154 --> 01:57:02.555]  We're going to break and then we'll come back and go to Rick and Sheldon and Chris and Abbie.
[01:57:02.595 --> 01:57:08.197]  We've got Brad Friedman, a journalist, coming on to talk about electronic voting machines.
[01:57:08.617 --> 01:57:16.320]  Not just fake newscasts and fake news propaganda and paid-off members of the press, but fake grassroots organizations.
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:18.861]  There's lots of those as well.
[01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:23.363]  And we'll just have Brad on for about 30 minutes and we'll continue with just all this other news.
[01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:28.187]  I want to talk about Sandy Berger who pleads guilty to stealing classified documents and doesn't get in trouble.
[01:57:29.307 --> 01:57:33.350]  But you get caught stealing documents, you're going to go to prison for a long time.
[01:57:34.751 --> 01:57:37.252]  But not old Berger.
[01:57:38.293 --> 01:57:40.254]  Mr. Berger will be right back.
[01:57:50.197 --> 01:57:54.378]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.019 --> 01:57:55.859]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.619 --> 01:57:57.499]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.519 --> 01:58:02.101]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.361 --> 01:58:06.442]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:21.514 --> 01:58:30.741]  Alright, we know that the press predominantly is controlled by hundreds of CIA agents as top editors of major newspapers and at major cable networks.
[01:58:30.781 --> 01:58:32.582]  That's been in the mainstream news many times.
[01:58:33.463 --> 01:58:39.668]  Then you've got the other press that just basically copies what they say, just kind of your useful idiots that write propaganda unknowingly.
[01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:49.555]  Then we have thousands of members of the press who are paid government contracts from a couple thousand dollars to upwards of two million dollars to lie.
[01:58:51.266 --> 01:58:52.226]  To lie to the public.
[01:58:53.027 --> 01:58:54.747]  To go out and push different agendas.
[01:58:57.088 --> 01:59:05.332]  But we also have fake grassroots organizations and we're going to be exposing that coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:59:06.212 --> 01:59:08.813]  We'll also continue with your phone calls.
[01:59:08.853 --> 01:59:12.114]  But San Francisco may regulate blogging.
[01:59:12.154 --> 01:59:18.477]  The government may regulate if you're allowed, notice it's a liberal city, if you're allowed to
[01:59:19.753 --> 01:59:20.794]  Have your own website?
[01:59:20.834 --> 01:59:23.775]  Well, we just can't have you out there doing all of this.
[01:59:23.795 --> 01:59:25.796]  You have to be paid off government media.
[01:59:26.597 --> 01:59:30.399]  And alternative websites and forums under attack by the FBI?
[01:59:30.439 --> 01:59:31.179]  They're getting scared.
[01:59:31.219 --> 01:59:31.959]  See, we're hurting them.
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:36.162]  And national ID card bill caught in legislative limbo?
[01:59:36.842 --> 01:59:38.963]  That's from Fox News telling you how great it is.
[01:59:39.563 --> 01:59:43.185]  Oil prices surpassed $58 and barrel?
[01:59:44.126 --> 01:59:44.786]  That's coming up.
[01:59:45.998 --> 01:59:49.880]  But first off, let's go back to your calls, Rick in Reno!
[01:59:50.941 --> 01:59:51.781]  It's an honor, Alex.
[01:59:52.042 --> 01:59:53.462]  It's an honor to talk to you, my friend.
[01:59:54.003 --> 01:59:59.305]  We here in the chatroom of nwochat.info have come up with a question for you today.
[02:00:00.326 --> 02:00:09.331]  With basically 58 million people or more having voted for Bush, and 55-56 million people having voted for Kerry,
[02:00:10.535 --> 02:00:18.101]  Half of whom hate Bush but love fetal genocide, that is abortion, and the other half think everything Bush does smell like roses.
[02:00:18.381 --> 02:00:21.764]  And that means 200 million people that didn't vote.
[02:00:22.344 --> 02:00:24.245]  Yeah, but how do we reach these people, Alex?
[02:00:25.106 --> 02:00:27.168]  They're caught in, like a football game.
[02:00:27.588 --> 02:00:30.310]  One side says, I like OU, the other says, I like Texas.
[02:00:31.031 --> 02:00:32.252]  And you go, but it's staged.
[02:00:32.332 --> 02:00:39.237]  I mean, I approach it like you're explaining to somebody that, well, boxing has fallen out of favor because everybody knows a lot of it's staged.
[02:00:40.074 --> 02:00:42.475]  And so you explain to them that it's staged.
[02:00:43.496 --> 02:00:48.318]  That, you know, one boxer takes a dive, the other poses as the winner.
[02:00:48.338 --> 02:00:52.080]  It's like WWF wrestling.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:01:00.343]  It's theater, and you show them how the policies are almost identical, and how the same corporate interests finance both sides.
[02:01:00.884 --> 02:01:03.045]  A lot of people wake up when you explain that to them.
[02:01:03.625 --> 02:01:06.026]  Yes, well, this... I mean, tell them that, you know,
[02:01:07.233 --> 02:01:13.438]  Let's say the Undertaker and The Rock, when they battle each other in professional wrestling, that's not real.
[02:01:14.579 --> 02:01:20.684]  I know grown men will argue with you, but they'll call it a conspiracy theory, but most people know wrestling isn't real.
[02:01:21.965 --> 02:01:22.706]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:22.806 --> 02:01:23.927]  You're doing a great job, man.
[02:01:23.967 --> 02:01:27.229]  I just wanted to call and ask you that question, and now we have the answer.
[02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:36.717]  Well, now I don't speak from the papal dais here, so you guys come up with your own answers, but that's my opinion on it.
[02:01:37.287 --> 02:01:37.807]  Thanks again.
[02:01:38.227 --> 02:01:39.728]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[02:01:40.288 --> 02:01:42.688]  Let's talk to Sheldon in Arizona.
[02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:44.129]  Sheldon, welcome.
[02:01:44.569 --> 02:01:45.089]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:45.409 --> 02:01:45.709]  Hello.
[02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:51.991]  I just wanted to report that I was down at the Border Rally in Naco, Arizona yesterday.
[02:01:52.791 --> 02:01:53.711]  Ah, with the Minutemen.
[02:01:54.512 --> 02:02:06.555]  Yeah, it actually was held right outside the Border Patrol substation and it was pretty unfortunate to find out when we got there that there were only 12 of us there.
[02:02:08.413 --> 02:02:13.498]  Well, there's people all over the place in different parts of the state.
[02:02:13.518 --> 02:02:17.182]  The Associated Press has reported that over a thousand people showed up.
[02:02:17.462 --> 02:02:18.984]  What was this particular meeting?
[02:02:20.025 --> 02:02:26.131]  It was a little sign walking outside of a border patrol substation.
[02:02:26.151 --> 02:02:27.712]  Was that part of the Minuteman Project?
[02:02:28.373 --> 02:02:31.075]  Yeah, uh-huh.
[02:02:31.156 --> 02:02:32.417]  Anything else to report to us?
[02:02:33.636 --> 02:02:38.479]  Um, yeah, I'd gone to Douglas right before that and there wasn't anything going on in Douglas at all.
[02:02:39.299 --> 02:02:40.380]  Alright, anything else?
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:42.941]  That'll be it Alex, nice talking to you.
[02:02:43.181 --> 02:02:44.462]  Stay there, I want to talk to you some more.
[02:02:44.502 --> 02:02:44.862]  We'll be back.
[02:02:45.828 --> 02:02:47.309]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.530 --> 02:02:50.612]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.752 --> 02:02:54.656]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.696 --> 02:02:58.940]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:03.043]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.183 --> 02:03:05.005]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.585 --> 02:03:08.468]  Police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.528 --> 02:03:13.232]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.412 --> 02:03:16.455]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.635 --> 02:03:19.477]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.978 --> 02:03:26.103]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.623 --> 02:03:30.424]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.824 --> 02:03:32.185]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.525 --> 02:03:33.585]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.605 --> 02:03:35.926]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.946 --> 02:03:37.367]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:45.269 --> 02:03:46.030]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:46.930]  Terrorism!
[02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:53.114]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:53.355 --> 02:03:54.956]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:55.196 --> 02:03:57.677]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.058 --> 02:04:12.647]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.667 --> 02:04:12.988]  government.
[02:04:13.168 --> 02:04:14.909]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:15.329 --> 02:04:21.253]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:21.373 --> 02:04:25.897]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:47.151]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:47.412 --> 02:04:51.254]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:51.574 --> 02:04:52.375]  Read the labels.
[02:04:52.815 --> 02:04:56.917]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:57.157 --> 02:05:01.360]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:06.603]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:06.983 --> 02:05:10.545]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:10.745 --> 02:05:16.087]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:16.367 --> 02:05:19.088]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:05:19.388 --> 02:05:20.288]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:05:34.155 --> 02:05:34.716]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.599 --> 02:05:52.659]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:54.460]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:55.960]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.701 --> 02:05:57.601]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.281 --> 02:06:02.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.443 --> 02:06:06.564]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.225 --> 02:06:18.688]  Well, George Bush told Congress when they funded 2,000 more Border Patrol to protect our southern border, he told them, I don't want them!
[02:06:19.483 --> 02:06:21.865]  I don't care if you passed it, I'm taking the money for something else.
[02:06:23.966 --> 02:06:26.387]  And then 1,200 plus people have showed up on the border.
[02:06:26.447 --> 02:06:29.049]  Over 30 aircraft has been reported by the mainstream news.
[02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:41.777]  And the last caller said that he just randomly drove around Arizona and did see 12 people out protesting at a border patrol station.
[02:06:41.817 --> 02:06:43.898]  I said, well, that's disheartening.
[02:06:44.778 --> 02:06:45.919]  During the break I talked to him.
[02:06:45.979 --> 02:06:47.340]  I said, that's disheartening.
[02:06:48.211 --> 02:06:49.492]  Did it say there was a protest?
[02:06:49.532 --> 02:06:50.152]  He said, no, no, no.
[02:06:50.533 --> 02:06:55.616]  The newspaper said the day before there had been one, so we just went there, and there was still twelve people there!
[02:06:56.516 --> 02:07:03.321]  So, of course you didn't find a big group of people there at that town, because they were... it had been the day before.
[02:07:04.822 --> 02:07:13.067]  But, no, the news is reporting that all along the border, groups of just hundreds of people in little conclaves, little nodes,
[02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:18.753]  are there reporting to the Border Patrol and demanding that they come arrest the illegals.
[02:07:19.013 --> 02:07:23.557]  And they just got binoculars out there and Bush is calling them evil vigilantes.
[02:07:24.618 --> 02:07:29.522]  But Bush wants you to have to carry a national ID card with a transponder chip in it.
[02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:35.667]  They've passed this in the House, it's now in the Senate, to go in shopping malls.
[02:07:35.707 --> 02:07:38.849]  It's going to scan it and make sure you're in good with the government.
[02:07:38.889 --> 02:07:39.670]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:07:41.465 --> 02:07:46.346]  So, everybody inside of the country will be tracked and traced, but no one will watch the northern and southern borders.
[02:07:47.486 --> 02:07:49.907]  Alright, I've got a bunch of other news I want to get to.
[02:07:49.927 --> 02:07:58.569]  There's so much, but before we go to Brad Friedman and bradblog.com, he really comes up with so much really powerful news.
[02:07:59.129 --> 02:08:00.310]  And all of you can do this.
[02:08:00.630 --> 02:08:02.610]  There's a lot of garbage blogs out there.
[02:08:03.690 --> 02:08:05.511]  There's a lot of great blogs out there.
[02:08:05.951 --> 02:08:08.972]  I mean, I've been blogging before they had the term blogging, since 1997.
[02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:16.996]  When I got InfoWars.com, we go and get mainstream news articles.
[02:08:17.036 --> 02:08:18.498]  We go research them for ourselves.
[02:08:18.799 --> 02:08:20.120]  We post comments about it.
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:21.242]  We do web searches.
[02:08:21.562 --> 02:08:22.684]  Post additional info.
[02:08:22.724 --> 02:08:23.464]  That's a blog.
[02:08:24.426 --> 02:08:25.908]  We go out and do our own reports.
[02:08:25.948 --> 02:08:27.209]  We go shoot our own video.
[02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:28.271]  Do our own interviews.
[02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:29.612]  Write reports about it.
[02:08:29.672 --> 02:08:30.073]  Post it.
[02:08:30.843 --> 02:08:45.136]  And blogs, as they're called, alternative media, are driving the news cycle now, forcing the control paid off, in many cases CIA media, and that's serious folks, to respond.
[02:08:46.677 --> 02:08:56.066]  Whether it's the James Gannon cases, or Bush and the Nazis, or just a hundred other major issues.
[02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:10.022]  And so I would challenge callers to call in during the next 50 minutes or, I don't know, we've actually got about 48 minutes left, and comment on different things that you've seen broken by alternative media.
[02:09:11.912 --> 02:09:13.193]  And this is important.
[02:09:13.233 --> 02:09:16.216]  Now with anything, don't believe what we say, check it out for yourself.
[02:09:16.576 --> 02:09:19.259]  With mainstream media, alternative media, you name it.
[02:09:19.679 --> 02:09:27.847]  A lot of these so-called blogs have led back to the Pentagon, to the White House, to the Democrats, to corporations.
[02:09:28.467 --> 02:09:33.472]  I remember about five years ago, I saw a frontline piece of all places.
[02:09:34.167 --> 02:09:47.879]  That was talking about how MTV had entire office buildings full of private companies they'd hired to go on to the chat rooms, the message boards, and create artificial buzz and spin for Viacom and MTV.
[02:09:48.279 --> 02:09:57.407]  And how record companies, CD companies, would hire whole buildings full of people to go out and create artificial buzz for what they're doing.
[02:09:58.428 --> 02:10:01.291]  And I coined the term, propaganda placement.
[02:10:02.325 --> 02:10:07.749]  Now, product placement is when you know they pay a million bucks in a major movie.
[02:10:07.769 --> 02:10:09.310]  I mean, they'll pay a million sometimes.
[02:10:09.331 --> 02:10:15.035]  They paid $36 million for the show Apprentice to have one airline plug.
[02:10:15.896 --> 02:10:20.179]  You know, covertly throughout the broadcast and also sponsoring it at the beginning and end.
[02:10:20.799 --> 02:10:23.321]  But to be woven into even the reality TV show.
[02:10:24.482 --> 02:10:26.584]  But that's product placement.
[02:10:26.604 --> 02:10:28.005]  You know, a million bucks for Budweiser.
[02:10:28.865 --> 02:10:29.186]  Okay?
[02:10:30.066 --> 02:10:30.807]  I mean, it's big money.
[02:10:31.983 --> 02:10:38.568]  You see a lot of these movies, and I went and saw Be Cool, the worst movie I've ever seen, and like 80% of the film was product placement.
[02:10:38.928 --> 02:10:46.353]  But government propaganda, that I call propaganda placement, is far worse and dwarfs everything else.
[02:10:47.073 --> 02:10:48.214]  And Bill Clinton was doing this.
[02:10:48.254 --> 02:10:51.716]  I remember finding out about Bill Clinton when I first coined the term about eight years ago.
[02:10:52.417 --> 02:10:55.679]  Paying millions of dollars for different specials on TV and different
[02:10:57.774 --> 02:11:26.683]  uh... dramas to insert anti-gun propaganda you name it and I scream bloody murder Bush has taken what Clinton was doing and he makes it look like child's play two hundred and forty something mil on one group of fake newscasts and the difference is in the past when they got caught Congress would have investigations and the White House would apologize when Nixon was doing it now Bush goes yeah that's the way it is Mac and I'm gonna do more of it
[02:11:27.785 --> 02:11:31.188]  But it isn't just paying off newscasts or running fake newscasts.
[02:11:31.789 --> 02:11:33.410]  It is paying off reporters.
[02:11:33.811 --> 02:11:34.531]  There's different types.
[02:11:34.591 --> 02:11:35.572]  Some are CIA.
[02:11:36.073 --> 02:11:38.215]  That's the church hearings, folks, decades ago.
[02:11:38.895 --> 02:11:51.327]  Some are just little media whores who know they spout this line, they go up the food chain, up the ladder, get FaceTime, get into those stupid press conferences where you get no real information.
[02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:57.213]  And then at the same time, then there are the types that are just flat-out paid off.
[02:11:57.713 --> 02:12:05.237]  And then the majority are just low-level reporters who are useful idiots who regurgitate what the mainstream media, the paid-for media, say.
[02:12:05.277 --> 02:12:08.479]  They just regurgitate what the New York Times, Washington Post have to say.
[02:12:08.699 --> 02:12:13.602]  I mean, the New York Times is leading the charge right now, criticizing Bush over paid propaganda.
[02:12:14.122 --> 02:12:15.643]  Well, they're just trying to keep their credibility.
[02:12:15.663 --> 02:12:18.524]  The New York Times ran, what is it, like 50 stories?
[02:12:18.544 --> 02:12:27.168]  It was like 56 stories about how they had the weapons of mass destruction, and it turns out the reporter doing that was directly on the White House control arm?
[02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:29.830]  Nobody wants to talk about that right now.
[02:12:30.570 --> 02:12:32.551]  So, they're all controlled, folks.
[02:12:33.411 --> 02:12:41.015]  And then I have articles like this, and we're going to Brad on thebradblog.com, who does break real news, and we found his info to be excellent.
[02:12:41.787 --> 02:12:44.409]  San Francisco may regulate blogging.
[02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:46.490]  I'm not kidding.
[02:12:46.771 --> 02:13:11.108]  See, this is what they're... And so out of the government being caught manipulating their fake grassroots blogs, and we're about to talk about some stuff that Brad Friedman has just discovered, that shows what Bush is doing, you know, with new lows, plumbing new depths, then they blame it on the alternative media and say, oh see, it's your fault, we've got to regulate you.
[02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:17.792]  It's like Bush tells the CIA to lie, and then when they get caught lying about weapons of mass destruction, he says, see?
[02:13:18.212 --> 02:13:18.752]  I'm good.
[02:13:18.832 --> 02:13:22.094]  Give me more power over them, because they lied.
[02:13:22.134 --> 02:13:22.794]  Well, you did it!
[02:13:24.574 --> 02:13:35.298]  Just when you thought the Federal Election Commission had it out for the biosphere, the blogosphere, excuse me, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors took it up a notch, again, so-called liberals,
[02:13:36.444 --> 02:13:48.513]  And announced yesterday that it will soon vote on a city ordinance that would regulate local bloggers and have them register with the City Ethics Commission and report all blog-related costs that exceed $1,000 in the aggregate.
[02:13:49.193 --> 02:14:00.761]  Blogs that mention candidates for local office receive more than 500 hits, will be forced to pay a registration fee that will subject the website to traffic audits, audits of free speech, audits of the press.
[02:14:01.122 --> 02:14:01.382]  See?
[02:14:01.902 --> 02:14:03.603]  This is campaign finance, folks.
[02:14:04.004 --> 02:14:05.385]  The entire board is set to admit
[02:14:05.931 --> 02:14:12.335]  To vote on the measure April 5th, that's tomorrow, I wonder if they'll be forced to register their own blogs here.
[02:14:12.655 --> 02:14:14.316]  I will never register with you!
[02:14:14.556 --> 02:14:16.017]  Everybody has to ignore this!
[02:14:17.037 --> 02:14:20.879]  Okay, joining us, and I've got a bunch of other news on this, is Brad Friedman.
[02:14:21.179 --> 02:14:24.321]  Brad, thank you for holding during that six-minute diatribe.
[02:14:24.641 --> 02:14:25.022]  Welcome.
[02:14:25.582 --> 02:14:26.983]  Hi, thanks, Alex.
[02:14:27.103 --> 02:14:28.784]  Good diatribe, appreciate it.
[02:14:28.924 --> 02:14:30.325]  Is that not scary, though?
[02:14:30.385 --> 02:14:34.067]  The feds and the cities are now talking about regulating our free speech?
[02:14:34.147 --> 02:14:42.512]  Well, you know what's going on, and it seems like when the government bodies here can't control the citizenry,
[02:14:43.246 --> 02:14:48.887]  They're instituting all kinds of practices to try and do exactly that.
[02:14:48.948 --> 02:14:52.789]  I mean, we saw it with, we're seeing it now, as you suggest, with the blogging.
[02:14:54.789 --> 02:15:05.592]  But we also saw it recently with the way that they're now trying to keep the exit polls, for example, which, you know, I'm big in election reform.
[02:15:06.454 --> 02:15:12.459]  The exit polls didn't come out their way, so now they're trying to institute a policy that will keep exit polls from being made public.
[02:15:12.479 --> 02:15:14.621]  That way we don't find out when fraud's going on.
[02:15:14.821 --> 02:15:15.341]  Exactly.
[02:15:15.381 --> 02:15:26.451]  So, you know, whatever can't be controlled as the laws of hell... Well, you know, Al-Qaeda, it's an Al-Qaeda sign if you're for transparency in government or if you're for exit polls.
[02:15:27.211 --> 02:15:28.152]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:15:28.532 --> 02:15:30.414]  And so, you know, they're instituting laws to
[02:15:31.013 --> 02:15:33.274]  Keep this information from getting out.
[02:15:33.314 --> 02:15:38.737]  The things that they can't control with the existing laws, well, they're just changing the laws.
[02:15:38.757 --> 02:15:40.498]  It's very troubling, indeed.
[02:15:41.839 --> 02:15:44.460]  You've got some big news you're going to break on the show today.
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:45.220]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:46.761 --> 02:15:56.786]  Last week on Brad Vlog, I discovered what is even more troubling, I think, in many ways, than the paid media you were talking about.
[02:15:57.787 --> 02:16:00.088]  It seems what is going on now is
[02:16:01.586 --> 02:16:10.892]  They are developing groups calling themselves non-partisan organizations to in fact control the information that's out there.
[02:16:12.113 --> 02:16:29.425]  It turns out that a group by the name of the American Center for Voting Rights came out of nowhere on March 17th and on March 21 they were testifying before a US House Administrative Committee hearing
[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:43.045]  uh... the hearing was looking into the election problems that occurred in ohio and uh... this group came out of nowhere uh... and all of a sudden they were talking about uh... problems with uh... voting registration fraud
[02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:50.633]  And other, well frankly, problems that didn't really have anything to do with all of the myriad problems that happened in Ohio.
[02:16:50.653 --> 02:16:58.338]  But just to boil it down, not only does Bush not let people who disagree with him into these stage town halls, now they're creating fake witness lists, basically.
[02:16:58.598 --> 02:16:59.018]  Indeed.
[02:16:59.558 --> 02:17:08.483]  It turns out that the American Center for Voting Rights is nothing more than a GOP front group that is currently headed by two people.
[02:17:08.623 --> 02:17:10.985]  One of them is a fellow by the name of Mark F.
[02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:12.890]  Thor Hearn.
[02:17:13.051 --> 02:17:16.392]  But they're not gay porn stars, so it's okay.
[02:17:16.512 --> 02:17:17.112]  Well, right.
[02:17:17.152 --> 02:17:17.472]  You know what?
[02:17:17.632 --> 02:17:20.733]  If they were, this story would probably get a lot more coverage.
[02:17:20.893 --> 02:17:22.374]  So, you know, we're still digging.
[02:17:22.414 --> 02:17:23.734]  We'll see what we can find out on them.
[02:17:23.774 --> 02:17:31.577]  But what we do know is that Thor Hearn is, in fact, the National General Counsel for Bush Cheney 04 Inc.
[02:17:32.357 --> 02:17:34.198]  Okay, give us details on the other side.
[02:17:34.258 --> 02:17:35.358]  Are you getting this, folks?
[02:17:36.408 --> 02:17:37.109]  Are you getting this?
[02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.730]  We have an independent testimony here from an independent group.
[02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:41.411]  Turns out he's on the payroll.
[02:17:41.872 --> 02:17:42.532]  Same thing.
[02:17:42.592 --> 02:17:43.393]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:43.413 --> 02:17:43.873]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.279 --> 02:17:51.781]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.121 --> 02:17:56.203]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.503 --> 02:17:57.063]  We listened.
[02:17:57.363 --> 02:18:02.346]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.626 --> 02:18:03.106]  We listened.
[02:18:03.486 --> 02:18:06.527]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.968 --> 02:18:07.468]  We listened.
[02:18:07.948 --> 02:18:12.010]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.390 --> 02:18:12.890]  We listened.
[02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:18.473]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.873 --> 02:18:20.234]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.594 --> 02:18:27.977]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:28.377 --> 02:18:32.799]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at

[02:18:35.921 --> 02:18:36.782]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:46.700]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:51.561]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:51.741 --> 02:18:59.543]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:59.803 --> 02:19:05.164]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:19:05.384 --> 02:19:12.346]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:12.666 --> 02:19:17.992]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:19:18.252 --> 02:19:22.977]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:19:23.338 --> 02:19:30.966]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:19:31.286 --> 02:19:33.969]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[02:19:34.409 --> 02:19:37.511]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:19:37.811 --> 02:19:38.971]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:38.991 --> 02:19:39.272]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.312 --> 02:19:42.253]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:57.094 --> 02:20:01.197]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:20:01.637 --> 02:20:10.302]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:20:11.123 --> 02:20:16.446]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:20:16.466 --> 02:20:24.571]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:27.829 --> 02:20:28.210]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:29.531]  It's absolutely free.
[02:20:29.551 --> 02:20:31.993]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:20:32.033 --> 02:20:32.634]  Just call right now.
[02:20:45.919 --> 02:20:47.060]  All water isn't the same.
[02:20:47.341 --> 02:20:52.326]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:20:52.586 --> 02:20:55.189]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:20:55.410 --> 02:21:03.939]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:21:04.299 --> 02:21:12.744]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a higher vibration state.
[02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:16.326]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.

[02:21:47.078 --> 02:21:52.239]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:55.260]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:59.021]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment for our guest, Brad Friedman.
[02:22:00.077 --> 02:22:01.598]  Bradblog.com, it's excellent.
[02:22:02.079 --> 02:22:05.481]  For those that don't understand this, let me calmly explain something to you.
[02:22:07.283 --> 02:22:13.207]  The Feds are talking about regulating online media because it's dangerous.
[02:22:13.407 --> 02:22:28.839]  We've now got San Francisco City Council talking about regulating, talking about going in and saying, oh, if you get over 500 hits, that's about 100 people visiting you on average,
[02:22:29.465 --> 02:22:31.666]  Because they click on multiple things and that causes a hit.
[02:22:32.247 --> 02:22:35.249]  Then you've got to pay us money and you've got to give us all your weblogs.
[02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:36.310]  No warrants, no nothing.
[02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:38.131]  Total violation of the First Amendment.
[02:22:38.151 --> 02:22:39.331]  I imagine the Soviet Union.
[02:22:39.352 --> 02:22:42.253]  You know, you've got to be registered media to be in the Soviet Union.
[02:22:42.954 --> 02:22:43.975]  But they just do it!
[02:22:44.395 --> 02:22:45.696]  Because they're threatened by us.
[02:22:45.736 --> 02:22:47.177]  Because we're starting to win.
[02:22:47.517 --> 02:22:48.818]  Because the paradigm is shifting.
[02:22:48.858 --> 02:22:50.619]  Because the media monopoly is breaking.
[02:22:51.583 --> 02:22:54.205]  One of the people out there breaking this phenomenon is Brad Friedman.
[02:22:54.866 --> 02:23:02.452]  Brad, continuing, I mean, we have GOP big dogs posing as grassroots organizations and then testifying before Congress.
[02:23:02.472 --> 02:23:03.773]  They're buying up everything!
[02:23:04.113 --> 02:23:12.499]  Yep, it's, you know, if you're familiar with the Jeff Gannon story and the Telenews organization that sort of came out of nowhere and Jeff Gannon a few days later was given a
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:15.821]  Press pass to the White House.
[02:23:16.341 --> 02:23:26.546]  That's what's going on here now with this American Center for Voting Rights, this fake GOP front group headed up by the General Counsel for Bush Cheney, O4, Inc.
[02:23:26.786 --> 02:23:28.887]  and the spokesman for the group.
[02:23:29.455 --> 02:23:34.737]  is the Republican National Committee's Communication Director, Jim Syke.
[02:23:35.157 --> 02:23:39.519]  And this group tells us how wonderful no-record electronic voting machines are.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:40.640]  Well, exactly.
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:45.622]  And they were the only such group, the only voting rights group, that was called before this U.S.
[02:23:45.642 --> 02:23:47.223]  Congressional hearing three days later.
[02:23:47.243 --> 02:23:48.063]  Now, you know, a lot of us
[02:23:48.904 --> 02:24:00.673]  I formed a group called VelvetRevolution.us which is comprised of now over a hundred voting rights and election reform groups that have been working on this topic for months and in some cases years.
[02:24:01.393 --> 02:24:08.459]  None of us were called to testify before Congress, but in fact folks from Bush, Cheney and the RNC were called.
[02:24:09.423 --> 02:24:15.748]  Furthermore, in their testimony, they never identified themselves as being related to Bush, Cheney, and the RNC at all.
[02:24:15.828 --> 02:24:20.971]  And they're always identified by the press as an independent, non-partisan group.
[02:24:21.011 --> 02:24:25.034]  That's called lying, and this was under oath, was it not?
[02:24:25.114 --> 02:24:26.615]  Indeed, I believe that it was.
[02:24:26.735 --> 02:24:30.838]  I'm still trying to get the full testimony from those hearings.
[02:24:31.298 --> 02:24:37.803]  I believe that it was under oath, and furthermore, they call themselves long-time voting rights advocates.
[02:24:37.903 --> 02:24:38.984]  Mind you, this was a hearing.
[02:24:39.611 --> 02:24:51.715]  That was looking into what could be potential criminal acts by Bush Cheney and or the RNC and these guys testify as if they're a voting rights advocate.
[02:24:51.755 --> 02:24:58.978]  I mean, it's extraordinary and in particular, 40 years, almost to the day now, we're 40 years from the Voting Rights Act.
[02:24:59.888 --> 02:25:14.285]  uh... when uh... you know people were murdered in this country fighting for voting rights uh... and uh... the march from selma to montgomery bloody sunday and so forth these guys have the nerve to come out and call themselves voting rights advocates
[02:25:15.244 --> 02:25:19.245]  Well, it's the same thing over and over again.
[02:25:19.325 --> 02:25:25.287]  I mean, we've got them calling in Memphis, business owners saying, don't have anti-Bush signs up in your window.
[02:25:25.687 --> 02:25:36.150]  We've got them arresting one Bush protester amongst 500 supporters, and the secret police say, well, you're not allowed to protest and arrest them, and they get six months in federal prison.
[02:25:38.170 --> 02:25:46.656]  The secret police out in the parking lots in Denver and they see an anti-war sticker and then run it according to the name of the person inside and run it and drag them out.
[02:25:46.976 --> 02:25:49.338]  We got Bush saying no one's allowed to wear ties.
[02:25:49.378 --> 02:25:53.140]  Take your ties off or you'll be thrown out because we want the image of no ties.
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.444]  This, and that was in Indiana, this is the level of micromanagement we're talking about.
[02:25:58.484 --> 02:25:59.905]  Well, you know what, let me tell you what.
[02:25:59.925 --> 02:26:01.726]  Hey listen, the Soviets weren't this good.
[02:26:01.926 --> 02:26:03.107]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:26:03.707 --> 02:26:10.912]  We have one recourse and that is the ballot box and so all the things that you're talking about in theory
[02:26:11.593 --> 02:26:18.416]  We can do something about it if we can vote the bad guys out and vote the good guys in, presuming we can find good guys.
[02:26:18.756 --> 02:26:26.839]  That said, the system is now being gamed, the very basics of our democracy, which is the voting system.
[02:26:26.939 --> 02:26:28.260]  You know, being able to vote.
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:30.000]  They are now gaming this system.
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:34.182]  They have convened what they're calling a Blue Ribbon Commission.
[02:26:34.602 --> 02:26:35.363]  We're good to go.
[02:26:51.294 --> 02:26:53.355]  It's the same thing with Bush and the CIA.
[02:26:53.555 --> 02:26:54.735]  He tells them to lie.
[02:26:54.895 --> 02:26:55.815]  They get caught lying.
[02:26:55.855 --> 02:26:57.295]  He says, see, I need more power now.
[02:26:57.495 --> 02:26:58.035]  Well, you know what?
[02:26:58.055 --> 02:27:06.557]  This is getting even worse and more obvious, Alex, because in 2000, after that election, they had a Blue Ribbon Commission that recommended the changes you're talking about.
[02:27:06.577 --> 02:27:09.538]  It was headed by Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.
[02:27:09.758 --> 02:27:15.639]  This time, the commission is headed by Jimmy Carter and, get ready for this,
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:17.820]  James A. Baker III.
[02:27:18.041 --> 02:27:20.661]  Oh, the Baker and Associates!
[02:27:20.741 --> 02:27:33.225]  The very person who was responsible for ensuring that Americans' votes were not counted in 2000 is now heading up a committee, a privately funded and secretly created committee.
[02:27:33.285 --> 02:27:33.985]  Hold it right back.
[02:27:34.145 --> 02:27:34.866]  So look at this.
[02:27:36.326 --> 02:27:37.246]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.726 --> 02:27:39.347]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.367 --> 02:27:42.928]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.081 --> 02:27:49.785]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[02:27:50.065 --> 02:27:54.370]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[02:27:54.590 --> 02:28:01.538]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:28:01.918 --> 02:28:08.568]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by colored crayons.
[02:28:08.889 --> 02:28:12.354]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.

[02:28:24.684 --> 02:28:31.387]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:28:31.587 --> 02:28:36.250]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.

[02:28:46.164 --> 02:28:49.725]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:49.785 --> 02:28:50.285]  are located?
[02:28:50.485 --> 02:28:53.866]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:29:46.346 --> 02:29:51.868]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:52.008 --> 02:29:53.069]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:29:53.189 --> 02:29:54.069]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:54.169 --> 02:29:57.010]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:57.210 --> 02:30:02.092]  Well, why mask the odor, when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:30:02.333 --> 02:30:03.413]  Check out this new product.
[02:30:03.573 --> 02:30:06.474]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:30:06.834 --> 02:30:10.536]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[02:30:10.716 --> 02:30:13.197]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:30:13.437 --> 02:30:18.259]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:21.681]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[02:30:21.801 --> 02:30:27.204]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:30:27.304 --> 02:30:28.064]  Trinobio.
[02:30:28.184 --> 02:30:29.164]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:30:30.325 --> 02:30:33.227]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:30:33.407 --> 02:30:35.628]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-BO.
[02:30:35.648 --> 02:30:38.931]  Check out their website at NO-BO.com.
[02:30:39.111 --> 02:30:43.293]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-BO at NO-BO.com.
[02:30:43.514 --> 02:30:54.481]  Alright, your calls on a score of issues are coming up here momentarily with our guest,
[02:31:01.175 --> 02:31:06.259]  And I know your comments and questions will be all over the map, but it all pertains to alternative media.
[02:31:07.099 --> 02:31:12.783]  Brad, I want to get back to the new Blue Ribbon Independent Commission.
[02:31:12.803 --> 02:31:19.227]  It's like Janet Reno appointed Senator John Danforth in a Justice Department investigation to investigate Waco.
[02:31:19.848 --> 02:31:20.788]  Surprise, surprise!
[02:31:20.828 --> 02:31:21.789]  They found her not guilty.
[02:31:22.390 --> 02:31:29.054]  Bush appoints his commission, tried to have Kissinger head it, and then they independently say, give Bush the power of a dictator.
[02:31:29.354 --> 02:31:29.514]  Why?
[02:31:29.574 --> 02:31:30.255]  It's independent!
[02:31:30.968 --> 02:31:32.951]  Is my arm independent of my body?
[02:31:34.433 --> 02:31:44.187]  Well, I tell you, this group, this commission headed by James Baker, is essentially set up to improve inclusion
[02:31:44.961 --> 02:31:54.886]  In the electoral process, this is the man who went to the Supreme Court, the architect, the mastermind... That name's thrown out, choice point, all the endless scamming, yes.
[02:31:55.046 --> 02:32:03.110]  And went to the Supreme Court to, you know, deny votes from Americans in Florida from being counted, period.
[02:32:03.250 --> 02:32:08.233]  And for those that don't know, if you're a black guy and your name's Brown, you're not going to be voting.
[02:32:09.065 --> 02:32:13.408]  Or if her name's Johnson, because some other Johnson did something, you're not going to be voting.
[02:32:13.649 --> 02:32:13.969]  Indeed.
[02:32:14.189 --> 02:32:27.319]  And this group that I was mentioning before, the GOP front group, apparently, calling themselves non-partisan, by the way, enjoying tax-exempt status, courtesy of the American people, for this non-partisan group.
[02:32:27.379 --> 02:32:29.360]  And of course, that'll all be selectively enforced.
[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:35.225]  Indeed, and apparently they knew about this Blue Ribbon Commission before anybody.
[02:32:35.285 --> 02:32:39.889]  The Commission itself put out a press release, we believe it came from the Commission, over U.S.
[02:32:39.949 --> 02:32:42.031]  Newswire last Thursday at 2 p.m.
[02:32:42.651 --> 02:32:51.759]  At 2.24 p.m., the American Center for Voting Rights, this fake group, put out their press release lauding the Commission.
[02:32:51.919 --> 02:32:54.801]  In other words, guys, the fix is in.
[02:32:54.981 --> 02:32:56.222]  Now let's be specific here.
[02:32:56.242 --> 02:32:56.783]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:58.257 --> 02:33:02.561]  Understand, folks, the people on the commission know what's going on.
[02:33:02.841 --> 02:33:06.864]  The minions coming forward are top RNC paid operatives.
[02:33:07.465 --> 02:33:08.806]  They've got tax exemption.
[02:33:08.846 --> 02:33:11.969]  The Blue Ribbon Commission is calling for all this.
[02:33:11.989 --> 02:33:14.231]  It's got Baker on it, involved in all the scamming.
[02:33:15.011 --> 02:33:19.914]  And all bloggers do, all the alternative media does is good old-fashioned reporting.
[02:33:20.314 --> 02:33:26.518]  You type the name of the people in who are supposedly independent into Google, you find out what they really do and post it.
[02:33:26.718 --> 02:33:31.861]  Takes about 10 minutes, and I'm not poo-pooing your work, but all of us could be doing this.
[02:33:32.441 --> 02:33:35.323]  Now, that's why they're so afraid of blogs.
[02:33:35.603 --> 02:33:37.644]  What do you think of how this ties in with
[02:33:38.436 --> 02:33:40.498]  The FBI harassing blogs.
[02:33:41.799 --> 02:33:44.901]  Now the San Francisco government wants to restrict blogs.
[02:33:45.321 --> 02:33:46.822]  I mean, we must be hurting them, Brad.
[02:33:47.463 --> 02:33:54.027]  I think they are frightened by what they're seeing out there because the blogs really can't be controlled.
[02:33:55.068 --> 02:33:57.710]  I think they're going to try in different places.
[02:33:57.970 --> 02:33:59.611]  I don't think they're going to succeed.
[02:33:59.631 --> 02:34:05.195]  Well, they're going to try to not upgrade the switcher points for Internet One and force us over to Internet Two.
[02:34:05.216 --> 02:34:05.736]  That's the plan.
[02:34:06.136 --> 02:34:07.297]  Well, that could be.
[02:34:07.477 --> 02:34:09.118]  You may be ahead of me on that one.
[02:34:10.018 --> 02:34:18.663]  I'm just trying to, you know, stay up to date with what the heck is going on because I'm the guy reporting this stuff and frankly it's absurd.
[02:34:18.683 --> 02:34:24.467]  You know, when you look at that whole Jeff Gannon incident in the White House where a fake reporter is sitting there for two years
[02:34:25.397 --> 02:34:27.859]  Link to a group funded by the GOP.
[02:34:28.159 --> 02:34:31.081]  And mainstream media just ignores that whole point.
[02:34:31.121 --> 02:34:36.664]  Well, you know, the guy's a prostitute within knife-throwing distance of the President.
[02:34:36.704 --> 02:34:40.146]  He's sitting in the middle of about a hundred journalists.
[02:34:40.186 --> 02:34:43.088]  He has a special authorization from Karl Rove.
[02:34:43.649 --> 02:34:47.331]  And he's sitting there in the middle of a hundred journalists for two years.
[02:34:47.951 --> 02:34:50.352]  And they're not reporting what this guy's doing.
[02:34:50.392 --> 02:34:51.592]  It comes to the bloggers.
[02:34:51.712 --> 02:34:53.513]  And Bush!
[02:34:53.853 --> 02:34:55.254]  Bush sure loved to go to him.
[02:34:55.894 --> 02:34:56.734]  Oh, sure he did.
[02:34:56.814 --> 02:35:02.196]  Have you heard that Gannon's got a book coming out that's going to say him and Bush are special friends?
[02:35:02.516 --> 02:35:10.559]  Well, I'd like to see how that came about, because so far we really don't know how he got in there, but we do know, as you suggest, it was
[02:35:11.139 --> 02:35:14.321]  The alternative media that exposed what was going on.
[02:35:14.341 --> 02:35:19.304]  But now Bush and the Democrats are saying they need to regulate us because we're bad.
[02:35:19.624 --> 02:35:26.309]  Well, right, because we're not doing what the corporate media is doing, which is pretty much rolling over and reporting whatever they tell that person.
[02:35:26.329 --> 02:35:33.173]  Well, they're trying to spin it because Gannon was a semi-blog that that says we're all bad when this was a fake White House blog.
[02:35:33.893 --> 02:35:37.776]  The amount of cynicism in play here right now... Mega-spin!
[02:35:38.636 --> 02:35:45.621]  Yeah, it can't be underestimated, and you're doing a great job of doing that and getting that word out, but it's really, you know, up to the people.
[02:35:45.681 --> 02:35:53.306]  Come by bradblog.com, come by other places like it, read what's there, share it with your friends, you can almost... And start your own blogs, folks!
[02:35:53.366 --> 02:35:55.007]  All you've got to do is take mainstream articles,
[02:35:55.447 --> 02:35:59.131]  Look at the angles, check the players behind it, expose lies.
[02:35:59.651 --> 02:36:00.792]  Brad, it's not hard to do, is it?
[02:36:01.172 --> 02:36:02.073]  No, it's not.
[02:36:02.153 --> 02:36:05.877]  It does take time, actually, and now I find myself doing this 24-7, so it takes...
[02:36:07.745 --> 02:36:11.746]  Let me ask you a question for those that don't think that they can have an effect.
[02:36:12.027 --> 02:36:14.608]  How long ago did you start a Brad blog?
[02:36:14.728 --> 02:36:15.888]  Just over a year ago.
[02:36:16.408 --> 02:36:18.009]  How many visitors are you getting now?
[02:36:18.609 --> 02:36:19.649]  Oh boy, it depends.
[02:36:19.689 --> 02:36:23.251]  When we break a big story we can be up to 20-25,000 a day easily.
[02:36:23.571 --> 02:36:24.551]  Okay, now let me just tell folks.
[02:36:24.971 --> 02:36:26.812]  I've had a website now for 7-8 years.
[02:36:26.832 --> 02:36:27.032]  Let me see.
[02:36:27.072 --> 02:36:27.032]  97, 98, 99.
[02:36:27.132 --> 02:36:27.372]  Yeah.
[02:36:28.392 --> 02:36:30.753]  Now I get about 25 million individual visitors a month.
[02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:37.662]  Now, that's got to scare them.
[02:36:37.742 --> 02:36:41.424]  You start a website, and now you're getting millions of visitors a year.
[02:36:42.044 --> 02:36:44.886]  And there's folks, they're spreading like wildfire!
[02:36:45.166 --> 02:36:48.028]  And the media can point out a few things on there that aren't true.
[02:36:48.388 --> 02:36:50.549]  Other people's sites, mistakes I make, whatever.
[02:36:50.909 --> 02:36:52.750]  Still, we're trying to tell the truth.
[02:36:52.990 --> 02:37:03.296]  We're doing real, old-fashioned reporting, and with the power of search engines, we're able to really catch these people, and either they shut us down, or they're going to get shut down, Brad.
[02:37:03.656 --> 02:37:08.582]  It's indeed, and you know you can do investigative, I call myself an investigative blogger.
[02:37:09.243 --> 02:37:14.288]  You look on the internet, you make phone calls, you do the thing that the press used to do but no longer does.
[02:37:14.308 --> 02:37:18.133]  You know, right now they're not reporting... Now they just take a press release and then...
[02:37:18.793 --> 02:37:20.955]  Just repeat the press release.
[02:37:21.175 --> 02:37:28.339]  Listen, I've sent press releases out to AP and Reuters before, and they'll take like half my press release and then just put it on there.
[02:37:28.399 --> 02:37:29.600]  I mean, they do that with me!
[02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:36.144]  Now, mind you, there are alternative media organizations that are directly funded, as you suggest, by
[02:37:36.881 --> 02:37:41.166]  One party or another, unfortunately, it seems to be the Republican Party that's doing this right now.
[02:37:41.846 --> 02:37:46.451]  And they are alternately taking this information and spinning it.
[02:37:46.732 --> 02:37:50.476]  And, you know, they have attacked me recently, the Cybercast News Service.
[02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:57.494]  I came out with a ridiculous article on the American Center for Voting Rights and what I'm doing.
[02:37:57.674 --> 02:37:58.855]  Listen, don't give them attention.
[02:37:58.975 --> 02:38:05.260]  Number one, as Gandhi said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:09.743]  Exactly, and I think we're at the then they attack us phase, which I think may be good news.
[02:38:11.050 --> 02:38:11.551]  No, it is!
[02:38:11.591 --> 02:38:18.200]  I mean, when Popular Mechanics attacks me, or Vanity Fair, or American Legion, or the New York Times, I know I'm over the target.
[02:38:19.261 --> 02:38:25.670]  Listen, Alex, it's really, it's up to the people, as you suggest, start a blog, go to read blogs,
[02:38:26.170 --> 02:38:37.757]  I don't mean to be self-servicing here, but donate to places like bradblog.com and all of the others because we are not funded by corporate money.
[02:38:37.797 --> 02:38:39.238]  We are not funded by government.
[02:38:39.278 --> 02:38:40.919]  We really rely on the people.
[02:38:41.419 --> 02:38:42.420]  So donate.
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:44.801]  Pass those links around to other people.
[02:38:44.821 --> 02:38:46.062]  The government is not going to do it.
[02:38:46.082 --> 02:38:48.043]  Your corporate media is not going to do it.
[02:38:48.083 --> 02:38:48.543]  Exactly.
[02:38:48.583 --> 02:38:50.964]  Folks, understand, we're having an effect right now.
[02:38:51.465 --> 02:38:53.246]  It is scaring the daylights out of them.
[02:38:54.086 --> 02:39:02.970]  And people know that the Democrats and Republicans are controlled by the same interests, so the establishment is panicking, pulling out all the stops with propaganda.
[02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:06.992]  It's not enough that the military-industrial complex owns the four networks.
[02:39:07.412 --> 02:39:12.755]  Now they've got to actively try to infiltrate cyberspace and watch the patriots
[02:39:13.624 --> 02:39:18.468]  That all they do is attack other patriots, those are your infiltrators as well.
[02:39:18.608 --> 02:39:23.392]  They're trying to game the very basic elements of our society, the very watchdogs.
[02:39:23.432 --> 02:39:29.216]  The Fourth Estate, journalists, non-profit groups, and frankly, the election reform system.
[02:39:29.257 --> 02:39:30.978]  If I can throw it out there, please.
[02:39:31.511 --> 02:39:38.717]  Have your listeners come by velvetrevolution.us, where we are taking on the American voting machine companies head-on.
[02:39:38.997 --> 02:39:40.258]  We're not counting on the press.
[02:39:40.538 --> 02:39:42.040]  We're not counting on the government.
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:43.841]  You know, they're wrangling about this stuff.
[02:39:43.861 --> 02:39:44.842]  Well, we are the press.
[02:39:44.882 --> 02:39:45.803]  Let's make some calls.
[02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:47.684]  And we'll talk about that in a second.
[02:39:48.445 --> 02:39:49.526]  Thanks for holding forever.
[02:39:49.546 --> 02:39:52.148]  Up next here is Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:39:52.248 --> 02:39:52.888]  Ed, go ahead.
[02:39:53.749 --> 02:39:54.570]  Hey, Alison, Brett.
[02:39:54.890 --> 02:39:55.190]  Hello.
[02:39:58.118 --> 02:40:05.100]  On ABC World News, they had a story about a Saudi Prince smuggling in two tons of coke on his private 727.
[02:40:07.481 --> 02:40:17.824]  And they were showing the coke, and the one block of coke on the table had a big swastika stamped into it by a sophisticated person.
[02:40:19.414 --> 02:40:20.975]  I was kind of blown away by that and stuff.
[02:40:21.195 --> 02:40:36.724]  Well, my new film shows how the Bushes are connected to the Nazis, Arnold, how the Bushes are connected to the narcotics trade, and when you... I mean, I didn't see this, but when you get right down to it, sir, that's really what they believe in.
[02:40:37.684 --> 02:40:39.905]  Oh, and anything else, Ed?
[02:40:41.166 --> 02:40:46.609]  Well, you know, the Nazis were hooked up with South America, you know, way before the 40s and the 30s and stuff, so...
[02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:50.652]  If anybody out there maybe had a VCR running on there, maybe they could send you a tape on that.
[02:40:50.672 --> 02:40:52.693]  Well, the Nazis are real big in Latin America.
[02:40:52.733 --> 02:40:53.393]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:53.713 --> 02:40:56.315]  In fact, Brad, you have some new dirt on Schwarzenegger.
[02:40:57.115 --> 02:41:04.919]  Well, yeah, I mean, and again, it goes back to the election reform system, because nothing, nothing matters if we can't have an honest election in this country.
[02:41:05.797 --> 02:41:13.300]  As you know, they forced, as I hope you know, they forced the Secretary of State in California, Kevin Shelley, out of his job.
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:19.563]  And he was the guy saying, I don't care what the courts and what the legislature says, we're going to keep these electronic voting machines.
[02:41:19.603 --> 02:41:20.103]  Well, no, no.
[02:41:20.163 --> 02:41:22.944]  Well, Shelley actually was the guy who said, no, we're not going to.
[02:41:22.964 --> 02:41:24.685]  No, no, but I'm saying the governor and the government.
[02:41:24.845 --> 02:41:25.945]  Oh, yeah, indeed.
[02:41:26.205 --> 02:41:32.308]  Shelley said that we're not going to have any voting in this state unless there's paper ballots with every vote.
[02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:34.350]  So, they got rid of him.
[02:41:34.411 --> 02:41:35.631]  He was a Democrat.
[02:41:35.831 --> 02:41:36.911]  Well, how dare him!
[02:41:36.971 --> 02:41:38.312]  Won a record of how you vote!
[02:41:38.332 --> 02:41:38.992]  That's amazing!
[02:41:39.012 --> 02:41:39.492]  Right.
[02:41:39.552 --> 02:41:46.694]  I mean, good Lord, we shouldn't be able to go back and count and make sure the vote in the world's greatest democracy was accurate.
[02:41:47.295 --> 02:41:49.615]  So, they got a new guy in there, and guess what?
[02:41:49.675 --> 02:41:54.877]  His transition team includes folks from Diebold, America's largest voting machine company.
[02:41:55.781 --> 02:42:00.831]  He got caught with a convicted computer crimes felon running stuff for Diebold in California.
[02:42:01.572 --> 02:42:07.084]  Yes, and in fact it looks like they are going to override Kevin Shelley's mandate and
[02:42:07.674 --> 02:42:13.858]  Allow electronic voting that doesn't, that can't be tracked, that isn't verifiable, that does not include a paper ballot.
[02:42:13.878 --> 02:42:16.780]  Well, didn't you know that Al-Qaeda wants to have a record of how you vote?
[02:42:17.941 --> 02:42:20.183]  Well, I don't know what's going on.
[02:42:20.343 --> 02:42:26.487]  I just tell you, if we don't pay attention to this and the very basic of our democracy, the voting system,
[02:42:27.148 --> 02:42:28.489]  We're in big trouble, Alex.
[02:42:28.649 --> 02:42:31.850]  Well, Brad, you know the difference between a democracy and a constitutional republic?
[02:42:31.891 --> 02:42:36.713]  I know you do and you're a good guy, but let me just... I'm not trying to school you here, but let me just give you my little tidbit on this.
[02:42:36.773 --> 02:42:36.973]  Yeah.
[02:42:37.393 --> 02:42:42.676]  In a democracy, if 51% say, we want to ship black people back to Africa, it happens.
[02:42:43.016 --> 02:42:43.176]  Right.
[02:42:43.296 --> 02:42:44.277]  In a republic,
[02:42:44.833 --> 02:42:46.754]  You notice Bush and Kerry both kept saying democracy.
[02:42:47.055 --> 02:42:53.319]  In a republic, the minority as well as the majority is protected because the Bill of Rights has supremacy.
[02:42:53.359 --> 02:42:54.300]  I just wanted to add that.
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:56.762]  No, in that case you're absolutely right.
[02:42:56.842 --> 02:43:00.504]  But we're talking about for presidential elections... The democratic process.
[02:43:00.524 --> 02:43:09.851]  Yeah, the process in the presidential elections in each state actually is a democracy where you are voting and the majority gets all the electoral votes.
[02:43:10.562 --> 02:43:18.665]  And that is the system that is being gamed right now, even while you've got George Bush running around saying we're spreading democracy throughout the world.
[02:43:18.705 --> 02:43:19.605]  Putting dictators in.
[02:43:19.625 --> 02:43:20.525]  Let's take another call.
[02:43:20.906 --> 02:43:21.926]  Brock in Canada.
[02:43:21.946 --> 02:43:23.226]  Brock, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:43:23.686 --> 02:43:24.407]  Hello Alex.
[02:43:24.687 --> 02:43:25.007]  Hello.
[02:43:25.566 --> 02:43:39.112]  Wanted to ask the relationship between George Bush and trying to get respect for that terrible organization called the United Nothing or United Nations.
[02:43:39.852 --> 02:43:48.956]  I'm wondering if he is going to be perpetuating lies and fraud to give them power or prestige or importance.
[02:43:48.996 --> 02:43:52.117]  Well the UN is controlled by the same global corporate interests and
[02:43:53.428 --> 02:43:55.389]  I mean, does that answer your question?
[02:43:55.409 --> 02:43:56.190]  I'm not quite sure.
[02:43:56.810 --> 02:43:58.792]  Well, I think that the U.N.
[02:43:58.912 --> 02:44:09.299]  is, uh, everyone must know how incompetent they are, and I just wonder where the, uh, you know, how are they going to try and get them respect?
[02:44:09.339 --> 02:44:09.899]  The U.N.
[02:44:09.939 --> 02:44:19.826]  basically enforces what the IMF and World Bank want while putting out, uh, fake left-wing rhetoric to make the third world think they've got a place to go for redress of grievances.
[02:44:22.773 --> 02:44:23.914]  Any comments on that, Brad?
[02:44:24.855 --> 02:44:35.383]  Well, you and I may see things differently on that one, and that's where, you know, that's why it's important that you and I agree, frankly, on so much, and I appreciate your opinion about the UN.
[02:44:35.643 --> 02:44:47.853]  I don't share it, and I am concerned the way, again, that Bush is now gaming that particular system with his recent appointees of Bolton and Paul Wolfowitz, the World Bank.
[02:44:48.968 --> 02:44:50.188]  Which is now a done deal.
[02:44:50.228 --> 02:44:51.208]  Thanks for the call, Brock.
[02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:53.069]  Rebecca in Ohio.
[02:44:54.129 --> 02:44:54.649]  Go ahead.
[02:44:55.689 --> 02:44:56.249]  Can you hear me?
[02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:57.910]  Yes, we can.
[02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:59.670]  I just want to comment on the Pope.
[02:45:00.610 --> 02:45:00.850]  Yes.
[02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:03.171]  I've been a long-time listener of yours.
[02:45:03.891 --> 02:45:05.211]  I just got your TV planet.
[02:45:06.911 --> 02:45:11.432]  And I just thought that you should know, you know, he was a good man.
[02:45:11.532 --> 02:45:13.992]  It's the people surrounding him in the high places.
[02:45:14.533 --> 02:45:17.053]  Colonel Ratzinger and Cass Rowley.
[02:45:17.608 --> 02:45:20.809]  You control media and control most of the functions.
[02:45:21.109 --> 02:45:24.069]  Well, ma'am, I wasn't a bashing Pope John Paul II.
[02:45:24.109 --> 02:45:25.749]  We know who the bad ones are.
[02:45:25.769 --> 02:45:28.350]  Yeah, well, the callers were.
[02:45:28.590 --> 02:45:40.652]  But I'm a traditional Catholic, and I fight this in my own church many times, but it wasn't our Pope who's done most of this.
[02:45:40.732 --> 02:45:41.672]  He was a good man.
[02:45:41.792 --> 02:45:46.913]  Well, I mean, he did call for a new world order, and he... And he also called Bush the Antichrist.
[02:45:47.631 --> 02:45:48.192]  Did he really?
[02:45:48.232 --> 02:45:48.852]  Yes, he did.
[02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:49.633]  I'll prove it.
[02:45:50.433 --> 02:45:50.914]  You're kidding.
[02:45:50.934 --> 02:45:52.035]  Well, please send him to me.
[02:45:52.255 --> 02:45:52.755]  No, I'm not.
[02:45:53.015 --> 02:45:55.377]  He did publicly in the Catholic Times.
[02:45:55.798 --> 02:45:59.240]  Well, I know that he was against the war.
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:01.242]  He was very much against the war.
[02:46:01.322 --> 02:46:09.429]  He told him, you know, he had to get out of that war and the atrocities that were happening in that war over in Iraq.
[02:46:10.293 --> 02:46:11.674]  He had told him several times.
[02:46:11.874 --> 02:46:17.137]  We have a lot of Catholic listeners, and we have a lot of Jewish listeners, and a lot of Protestant listeners.
[02:46:17.197 --> 02:46:17.417]  I know.
[02:46:17.437 --> 02:46:19.899]  And I know you wouldn't do any bashing or anything.
[02:46:20.179 --> 02:46:24.201]  I just wanted your listeners to know that he himself was a very good man.
[02:46:24.221 --> 02:46:30.245]  I know of several times they came out and said that there was a certain priest that was excommunicating stuff.
[02:46:30.845 --> 02:46:32.906]  The Pope excommunicated, and it's not true.
[02:46:33.366 --> 02:46:34.187]  We can prove it.
[02:46:34.287 --> 02:46:37.449]  Okay, well listen, Rebecca, I appreciate the call.
[02:46:37.829 --> 02:46:38.849]  Stacy in Illinois.
[02:46:38.869 --> 02:46:39.570]  Stacy, go ahead.
[02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:51.299]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say Brad I'm a big fan of your blog and I do read it every day and I appreciate the good work that you guys are doing because you know clearly the mainstream media is not doing their job.
[02:46:52.079 --> 02:47:00.806]  I have a question both for you and Alex and I'd like to know what do you think of these Kay Griggs videos that have come out?
[02:47:01.877 --> 02:47:08.287]  The wife of a general, an army general, and she's come out speaking about the homosexual and satanic subversion of the military.
[02:47:08.928 --> 02:47:12.273]  And the videos were linked to on two websites.
[02:47:12.313 --> 02:47:17.060]  They were on Eric Huffschmid's website, which is hugequestions.com.
[02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:22.945]  And then they were also linked on a blog called libertythink.com.
[02:47:23.005 --> 02:47:30.892]  I think also possibly on rigorousintuition.com as well, but I'd like to hear your comments on that because I don't think... Well, let me just comment quickly.
[02:47:31.272 --> 02:47:35.696]  We know there is a major, major homosexual activity in the White House.
[02:47:36.196 --> 02:47:38.959]  We know a lot of these Republican governors are, members of Congress.
[02:47:39.699 --> 02:47:40.900]  One out in California.
[02:47:41.741 --> 02:47:44.263]  And when it comes out about them, it gets shut down.
[02:47:44.323 --> 02:47:46.145]  When it's a Democrat, they have to leave office.
[02:47:46.885 --> 02:47:48.826]  And this could bring them down.
[02:47:49.307 --> 02:47:49.667]  Brad?
[02:47:50.447 --> 02:47:52.468]  Actually, I wish I could comment on those videos.
[02:47:52.588 --> 02:47:53.349]  I haven't seen it.
[02:47:53.389 --> 02:48:08.517]  I think she makes a good point, though, that issues of note like that and issues of, you know, we had a report last week on the WMD not existing and the intelligence, they made it look as if it was all the intelligence service.
[02:48:09.057 --> 02:48:10.238]  That didn't get any play.
[02:48:10.298 --> 02:48:15.261]  We're instead, and I know you and I, Alex, feel differently, I think, about the Shabo issue, but
[02:48:15.942 --> 02:48:33.395]  We've got a media that picks these issues, whether Chavo or Michael Jackson or the Pope dying and, you know, plays them wall-to-wall, covers them wall-to-wall when, truthfully, the real issues that we need to be concerned about, like $9 billion missing in Iraq, just gone.
[02:48:33.415 --> 02:48:35.576]  $9 billion is not covered.
[02:48:35.656 --> 02:48:37.477]  There's trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[02:48:38.218 --> 02:48:39.339]  Trillions with a T-word.
[02:48:39.999 --> 02:48:41.741]  We'll be right back with a Warrior Call.
[02:48:41.761 --> 02:48:42.141]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.235 --> 02:48:50.538]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.759 --> 02:48:55.182]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.342 --> 02:48:59.706]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.746 --> 02:49:01.087]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.888 --> 02:49:07.112]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.172 --> 02:49:14.098]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.238 --> 02:49:16.299]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:27.169]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.249 --> 02:49:29.991]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[02:49:30.071 --> 02:49:31.313]  This is a two and a half hour video.

[02:51:51.437 --> 02:51:53.198]  Talking to Brad Friedman of bradblog.com.
[02:51:53.218 --> 02:51:55.519]  Take a final call from Jeff in Ohio, but recapping quickly, Brad.
[02:52:18.607 --> 02:52:37.059]  Yeah, real quickly, we've discovered that the fake Voting Rights Group, the American Center for Voting Rights, has set up a non-partisan organization and in fact they are a smokescreen and they're completely run by the Bush, Cheney, and Republican National Committees to try to steal your vote from you.
[02:52:37.079 --> 02:52:43.003]  Actually run by sitting top heads of this administration and its campaign.
[02:52:43.123 --> 02:52:46.686]  Correct, and we are taking on that sort of thing and
[02:52:47.310 --> 02:52:56.416]  Forgetting taking government out of the loop entirely, and the people are going straight to the voting machine companies to get them to do the right thing at velvetrevolution.us.
[02:52:56.756 --> 02:52:59.558]  There needs to be racketeering lawsuits.
[02:52:59.598 --> 02:53:04.181]  We've got collusion with these companies to subvert and destroy our republic.
[02:53:04.381 --> 02:53:10.445]  We do, and we want your listeners to come on by and click the link to send email to the companies
[02:53:10.985 --> 02:53:18.953]  Letting them know this has got to stop, otherwise we are launching a massive divestiture and boycott against these companies, their affiliates, and their clients.
[02:53:19.094 --> 02:53:21.356]  The pocketbook is the only vote we have left, Alex.
[02:53:21.883 --> 02:53:27.867]  But this is about total power, and most of these companies are run by former CIA directors or heads of the NSA.
[02:53:28.527 --> 02:53:29.968]  Talkbooks that have gone to these companies.
[02:53:30.048 --> 02:53:34.271]  It's guarded by young men with short haircuts walking around with machine guns under their jackets.
[02:53:34.551 --> 02:53:35.892]  It's a government operation, folks.
[02:53:36.392 --> 02:53:38.333]  It's up to the people to do something about it.
[02:53:38.553 --> 02:53:39.374]  Jeff in Ohio.
[02:53:39.394 --> 02:53:40.454]  You've got about 60 seconds.
[02:53:40.474 --> 02:53:41.135]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:53:41.455 --> 02:53:41.935]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:41.995 --> 02:53:45.838]  Just wanted to try to drop something in your brain.
[02:53:46.438 --> 02:53:50.961]  I think while we have the end of the Terry Schiavo incident and we have
[02:53:51.822 --> 02:54:17.821]  Religious leaders all over the country saying that we need to rein in these state courts would be a perfect time to strike at the heart of the Constitution Restoration Act so that they can't backpedal on that and ask their constituency to push that so that judges can't be restricted based on stupid issues like gay marriage and things like that.
[02:54:18.464 --> 02:54:29.893]  You mean, because right now they're saying the federal court should be able to intervene on the lower court because of what happened to Terry, but before this happened they were saying that the federal court should not be able to intervene.
[02:54:29.933 --> 02:54:32.935]  Well yeah, I'm all for Terry, but this is what they'll do.
[02:54:33.256 --> 02:54:36.358]  They'll create the crisis, do nothing, and then call for more control.
[02:54:36.378 --> 02:54:37.499]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[02:54:38.726 --> 02:54:41.569]  Well, I want to thank you, Brad, for joining us.
[02:54:41.609 --> 02:54:44.751]  Brad Friedman, bradblog.com, and I hope to have you back up soon, sir.
[02:54:44.952 --> 02:54:45.472]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:45.632 --> 02:54:46.133]  Anytime.
[02:54:46.213 --> 02:54:46.953]  Always good to be here.
[02:54:47.133 --> 02:54:47.874]  Take care, my friend.
[02:54:47.914 --> 02:54:48.254]  Thank you.
[02:54:48.475 --> 02:54:48.795]  All right.
[02:54:48.835 --> 02:54:51.697]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central, here in the last minute and a half.
[02:54:51.737 --> 02:54:56.662]  I want to thank all of our affiliates, our sponsors, our listeners, the great folks that make the broadcast possible.
[02:54:57.242 --> 02:55:04.406]  And I want to encourage all of you to get my new film, my 12th film, Martial Law, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:04.426 --> 02:55:07.447]  9-11, Rise of the Police State, now out on DVD.
[02:55:07.888 --> 02:55:09.969]  Just over 3 hours long on DVD.
[02:55:10.489 --> 02:55:12.330]  2 hours 35 minutes on VHS.
[02:55:12.350 --> 02:55:13.891]  Covers the latest police state developments.
[02:55:14.511 --> 02:55:16.352]  Covers the latest 9-11 info.

[02:55:17.673 --> 02:55:18.793]  We confront Michael Moore.
[02:55:18.813 --> 02:55:21.955]  We confront David Gergen on the satanic cults.
[02:55:23.092 --> 02:55:24.553]  I hope you spread that around on the web.
[02:55:24.573 --> 02:55:26.275]  That's on PrisonPlanet.tv for free.
[02:55:26.595 --> 02:55:29.258]  We show the Bush-Nazi-Schwarzenegger connection.
[02:55:29.758 --> 02:55:32.801]  And the film ends with showing Bush swearing in.
[02:55:32.821 --> 02:55:35.624]  And then we show how he's violated the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:55:36.145 --> 02:55:37.246]  It's my best film.
[02:55:37.506 --> 02:55:37.246]  $25.95.
