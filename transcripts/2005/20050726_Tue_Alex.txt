[00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:06.064]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:07.784]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:09.645]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:11.125]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.366]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:17.387]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:23.709]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.870]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.211]  It is Tuesday, the 26th day...
[00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.178]  Of July 2005.
[00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:51.602]  And we're going to be getting into the latest movements in the expansion of the Pan-American Union, the Union of American States, via CAFTA.
[00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:55.223]  Just one more step towards the Pan-American Union.
[00:00:56.123 --> 00:01:03.065]  Also, just huge new developments in the London bombings of two and a half weeks ago and of last week.
[00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:10.956]  As well as the shooting of the innocent Brazilian man, the 27-year-old electrician.
[00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:18.462]  They're now saying he had eight bullets pumped into him, seven into his head, and one into his chest.
[00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:22.605]  And it was done execution style.
[00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:23.685]  Why?
[00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:26.608]  Well, I will say he looks like a young military man.
[00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:30.931]  Doesn't look like much of an electrician to me.
[00:01:32.068 --> 00:01:38.252]  You know, the globalists like to contract out of Latin America for a lot of their spooks and kooks.
[00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:55.683]  Maybe this poor young fella knew a little bit more than he was supposed to know, or maybe special branch police, plainclothes, now connected to the military, just chased him down and sat on him and executed him.
[00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:57.725]  Do you really believe that?
[00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:01.467]  Do you really believe that for a minute?
[00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:06.298]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:12.819]  And more fear-mongering by Drudge and the New York Post, of course, Rupert Murdoch's publication.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.001]  Bin Laden had planned to sell poison cocaine to Americans in 2002.
[00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:22.421]  Of course, that's just ridiculous.
[00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:32.923]  I mean, the minute it got delivered, the minute it got broken up and tested, drug dealers would test it and die, and maybe a few dozen people might get sick.
[00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:39.213]  The globalists would never, never allow that to happen.
[00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:42.434]  They control the drug trade.
[00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:51.637]  The vast majority of narcotics coming into this country, it's just like the psychotropics that are pushed on our children by Big Pharma.
[00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:53.118]  They own it.
[00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:53.778]  They run it.
[00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:56.299]  So just more theater.
[00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:01.437]  Remember, whenever you hear Osama bin Laden, you mean CIA, Al-CIA-dom.
[00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:15.648]  Osama bin Laden tried to buy a massive amount of cocaine, spike it with poison, and sell it in the United States, hoping to kill thousands of Americans one year after the 9-1-1 attacks.
[00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.691]  The New York Post reported on Tuesday.
[00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:30.137]  The evil plot failed when the Columbia drug lords that Lawton approached decided it would be bad for their business, possibly for their own health.
[00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:32.218]  I'll tell you more about that later.
[00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:47.582]  Pentagon blocks release of Abu Ghraib images, and, well, yeah, two years ago, the Senate saw thousands of photos and hundreds of videos, and it was of even far worse stuff than beating people to death and
[00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.130]  And, you know, letting dogs bite them.
[00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.331]  It was raping.
[00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:56.435]  It was Jeffrey Dahmer-type conservatism.
[00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:01.039]  It was Joseph Mingala-type stuff.
[00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.462]  And now the Pentagon says, no, no, no, we're not going to show you that.
[00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:08.925]  Rush Limbaugh says they're just blowing off steam.
[00:04:10.727 --> 00:04:15.431]  Oh, by the way, we mentioned this yesterday, but I haven't covered it enough out of the Cambridge News.
[00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:29.234]  I was in the tube bomb carriage and survived, and the survivor talks about how there was an explosion up to the bottom of the train, and the metal was pointed up, and the policeman pointed it out to him.
[00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:35.899]  So we'll spend a little bit more time on that while we're trying to get this gentleman on.
[00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.642]  And a tube bomber prepares to strike a new total release.
[00:04:41.702 --> 00:04:42.623]  Why, there's their proof.
[00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:46.065]  It's a dark-skinned person standing on a train.
[00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:47.606]  Inclusive.
[00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:48.687]  It's the bomber.
[00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:51.809]  If you read deeper in the article, it says suspect.
[00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.930]  Suspect.
[00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.192]  Now, there's just so much coming up, folks.
[00:04:57.792 --> 00:04:58.273]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.293 --> 00:04:58.893]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.904]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:06.746]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:11.772]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:16.517]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.143]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:24.185]  The Constitution has been shredded and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:28.949]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:33.552]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:38.976]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death.
[00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:41.017]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.218 --> 00:06:02.819]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.040]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.081]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:16.903]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.063 --> 00:06:20.084]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.284 --> 00:06:22.685]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:30.687]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.587]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:03.263]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:07.345]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:08.485]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:13.048]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:17.450]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.692]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.092 --> 00:07:26.674]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:32.198]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.478 --> 00:07:35.200]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.401]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:42.465]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:49.589]  Call Cal Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:52.310]  That's 800-340-7091, or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.091]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:01.933]  It is the 26th day, the 26th day...
[00:08:16.244 --> 00:08:17.566]  We're good to go.
[00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:47.976]  Young Brazilian man who was executed by special services and by some of the special police.
[00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:50.597]  This whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:08:52.537 --> 00:08:57.478]  But let's just plunge into the other issues right now.
[00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:04.620]  In fact, a few news articles that I've seen over the last few days that we've mentioned but we haven't spent enough time on are...
[00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:13.086]  Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson is pimping for implanted microchips.
[00:09:14.547 --> 00:09:15.647]  Oh yes, my friends.
[00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:26.151]  And he has now announced that he is going to be taking the implantable microchip and promoting it in speeches around the country.
[00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:34.774]  Thompson reportedly plans to promote subdermal biochips by having one planted in his arm traveling around the country.
[00:09:35.549 --> 00:09:40.433]  Telling school children and college students how wonderful it is.
[00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:49.299]  So, we have just all of these bigwigs out there getting their chips.
[00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:52.461]  You know, the Mexican Attorney General got his chip over a year ago.
[00:09:53.622 --> 00:10:00.247]  And if you want to work in his office in the secure area, he ordered hundreds of his employees to take the chip.
[00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:01.567]  But hey, we're not making you.
[00:10:01.948 --> 00:10:03.469]  You don't have to have a job here.
[00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:05.916]  And by the way, folks, that's slavery.
[00:10:05.936 --> 00:10:06.737]  That is coerced.
[00:10:06.777 --> 00:10:07.557]  That is forced.
[00:10:08.318 --> 00:10:11.800]  I mean, either you do this, either you take this chip or you're fired.
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.281]  I mean, that's slavery.
[00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.543]  They're making you take the chip or they're going to take your livelihood.
[00:10:17.523 --> 00:10:23.067]  That's how imperial controllers throughout history have controlled their slaves.
[00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:25.928]  You do what we say or we won't give you the food.
[00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.691]  Well, it's the same thing saying you take the chip or you don't have your job.
[00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:31.672]  Your career is over.
[00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:33.536]  And we're all going to face this.
[00:10:33.556 --> 00:10:36.758]  We're all now going to have to thumb scan and face scan to get driver's license.
[00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:38.899]  And the next will be the chip.
[00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:39.900]  I mean, it's here, folks.
[00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.622]  It's here, and it's happening.
[00:10:45.224 --> 00:10:45.904]  Here's another one.
[00:10:45.924 --> 00:10:48.506]  This came out yesterday.
[00:10:49.026 --> 00:10:51.688]  GM Crops Created Super Weed.
[00:10:53.035 --> 00:11:00.139]  Say scientists, so genetically modified crops have created super weeds, and this is just the latest study, the latest development.
[00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:12.485]  I remember eight years ago reading about super weeds and oak trees growing corn out of the sides of their branches, and then the trees dying.
[00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:18.488]  You have to understand that 90 plus percent of the DNA, scientists thought it was junk.
[00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:22.267]  And only about 4% was, quote, active.
[00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:26.030]  And then, boy, if we manipulate that 4%, we can control things.
[00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:41.145]  What they found is, you change one gene, it then makes thousands of changes in the other 96%, and then it doesn't lock, especially with plants, the DNA in to only that species.
[00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:43.127]  It allows it then to start jumping.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.844]  into other plant species, and then yes, even into animal species.
[00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:58.250]  And it creates all sorts of new viruses, and new mutations in bacteria, and new mutations in plankton.
[00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:10.378]  I mean, we've had top DNA experts, you know, the fathers of whole areas of DNA research, and DNA protein sequencing, and
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.921]  They'll tell you.
[00:12:12.381 --> 00:12:13.822]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:12:14.223 --> 00:12:16.224]  This could kill everyone on Earth.
[00:12:19.727 --> 00:12:30.856]  Modified rap crosses with wild plant to create tough pesticide-resistant strain.
[00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:37.342]  Modified genes from crops in a GM crop trial have transferred into local wild plants.
[00:12:38.024 --> 00:13:00.855]  Creating a form of herbicide-resistant superweed, the Guardian can reveal the crop's fertilization between GM oilseed and Brassiska, and a distantly related plant, Sherlock, have been connected as virtually impossible...
[00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:12.289]  ...by scientists with the Environment Department was found during a follow-up to the government's three-year trials of GM crops, which ended two years ago.
[00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:15.587]  And by the way, they don't even allow trials here in the U.S.
[00:13:15.647 --> 00:13:17.768]  Just everything is automatically authorized.
[00:13:18.148 --> 00:13:21.989]  Again, you want to put spider genes in goats and their udders are spinnerets.
[00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:31.993]  You want to put cockroach genes in corn or tomatoes, salmon genes in pigs, human genes in pigs, you know, 14 different, you know, bug genes in a pig.
[00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:33.873]  I mean, you name it, they're doing it, folks.
[00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:35.654]  You want to grow human embryos in a cow?
[00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:36.394]  Do it.
[00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:38.035]  You want to grow human embryos in rats?
[00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:38.215]  Do it.
[00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:46.597]  You want to put human genes into a chimpanzee and make it 90% human, but then it doesn't have its rights because it's still 10% chimpanzee?
[00:13:46.817 --> 00:13:50.058]  That's going on down in Central America.
[00:13:51.818 --> 00:13:53.959]  I mean, this is what's happening in Costa Rica.
[00:13:54.659 --> 00:14:06.521]  The new form of charlot was growing among many others in a field which had been used for GM rap, which scientists treated it with lethal herbicide.
[00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:08.421]  It showed no effects on it.
[00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:13.775]  And so it's jumped into several other plant species that are differently related.
[00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:18.279]  And it's a long seven-page article, folks.
[00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:20.480]  I mean, what am I supposed to say here?
[00:14:21.201 --> 00:14:21.921]  This is nothing.
[00:14:23.102 --> 00:14:25.464]  Again, we have that top scientist on from the UK.
[00:14:25.484 --> 00:14:27.005]  He was one of the top government experts.
[00:14:27.045 --> 00:14:33.670]  And also, again, the father of many different forms of DNA sequencing and genetic engineering.
[00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.772]  A few months ago,
[00:14:37.088 --> 00:14:42.791]  Big articles in the Telegraph and the Independent because, you know, six years ago he was attacked for his findings.
[00:14:42.811 --> 00:14:44.232]  He was pro-GM, by the way.
[00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:49.274]  Genetically modified organisms and, you know, multi-species organisms.
[00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:51.295]  And, you know, chimeras.
[00:14:53.717 --> 00:15:00.340]  And then he found that just manipulating one gene in a potato so the potato would grow faster and last longer...
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:15.409]  That manipulating one gene in the potato, just one simple gene, forget shooting a whole bunch of DNA in from, say, a salamander into a corn stalk, into corn.
[00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:30.379]  They found that just by doing that, changing that one little aspect of a gene, that they fed it to rats, newborn rats, and that the rats...
[00:15:31.466 --> 00:15:33.267]  Their stomachs would grow faster.
[00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:35.248]  Their brain would be smaller.
[00:15:35.288 --> 00:15:37.749]  They would live about a third as long.
[00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:39.650]  Many of them outright died.
[00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.091]  They had weird blood count problems.
[00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:44.632]  They were mutated.
[00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:50.914]  Normally a mutation, well not normally, almost always, a mutation comes in the genetic code.
[00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:55.937]  It comes during its embryonic formation and then you're born with the defects.
[00:15:56.337 --> 00:15:58.978]  Whether you're a field mouse or a homo sapien sapien.
[00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:00.332]  Or a canine.
[00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:01.633]  A familiaris.
[00:16:02.674 --> 00:16:03.855]  But not anymore.
[00:16:04.055 --> 00:16:04.556]  Oh, no.
[00:16:04.656 --> 00:16:06.978]  We get downright mutations during growth.
[00:16:07.739 --> 00:16:08.579]  How wonderful.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.023]  And, by the way, these potatoes are on U.S.
[00:16:13.043 --> 00:16:13.744]  store shelves.
[00:16:13.864 --> 00:16:15.326]  Most potatoes are now GM.
[00:16:16.246 --> 00:16:16.987]  And they're everywhere.
[00:16:17.007 --> 00:16:19.449]  And you're just enjoying them, gobbling them with pleasure.
[00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.292]  And, again, don't listen to me, folks.
[00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:24.274]  Just keep eating it.
[00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:38.405]  And Bush is a Christian, and 9-11 was carried out by Al-Qaeda, and fluoride is good for you, so drink that tap water, and so is mercury in the vaccines, and just don't listen to us, folks.
[00:16:38.485 --> 00:16:44.687]  I mean, Tommy Thompson just left Lord Bush's administration.
[00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:47.608]  He's out taking the chip, out promoting it to your school children.
[00:16:47.648 --> 00:16:53.731]  I mean, that's normal to have, you know, former cabinet members out promoting to take the chip, and things aren't weird.
[00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:54.891]  Things aren't strange right now.
[00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:59.009]  I mean, it's not weird to have Sean Hannity constantly saying everybody needs a microchip.
[00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:01.651]  I mean, if you don't take a chip, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:05.153]  And I suggest you eat pigs that have human genes in them.
[00:17:05.213 --> 00:17:05.994]  I'm sure it's delicious.
[00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:11.438]  Doesn't matter if the top scientists are saying it could give rise to a deadly super virus and kill all of us.
[00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:12.999]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:13.880]  Give all your rights up.
[00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:19.444]  Again, you know, we're a radical show.
[00:17:19.484 --> 00:17:23.927]  A lady called in a few months ago and she talked about how she's pretty conservative, but her mother called her a hippie.
[00:17:24.938 --> 00:17:29.581]  Because she buys grain-fed, grass-fed beef.
[00:17:31.102 --> 00:17:31.923]  And just think about it.
[00:17:31.943 --> 00:17:33.744]  I mean, that really illustrates it all.
[00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:34.864]  How weird we are.
[00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:36.005]  How bizarre we are.
[00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:38.367]  How extreme we are.
[00:17:38.407 --> 00:17:39.367]  How kooky we are.
[00:17:39.407 --> 00:17:41.349]  How out of control we are.
[00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:44.291]  Because, I mean, I know others that have been made fun of for this.
[00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:47.553]  Imagine, you know, a cow is supposed to eat grass.
[00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:49.874]  They're not designed to eat meat.
[00:17:52.096 --> 00:17:52.236]  And...
[00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:55.030]  That's why they have three stomachs.
[00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:02.594]  And imagine thinking that it's bad to feed cows meat, much less their own species feeding cows cows.
[00:18:02.934 --> 00:18:08.557]  And then, of course, it's downer cows, diseased cows, cows that are being fed rotten meat.
[00:18:09.137 --> 00:18:16.961]  They have rendering plants where they throw different pig parts, chicken parts, other poultry parts, cow parts into these big soups and render them down into blocks.
[00:18:17.021 --> 00:18:20.603]  And then that's ground up and put into different types of range cubes and blood meal.
[00:18:21.544 --> 00:18:21.644]  And...
[00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:26.033]  Man, and imagine, it causes problems and makes us sick.
[00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:28.674]  But, again, we're just weirdos, folks.
[00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:30.515]  We think you should feed a cow grass.
[00:18:31.096 --> 00:18:32.356]  We are evil, folks.
[00:18:33.577 --> 00:18:47.225]  We think, here on this broadcast, that mercury, because all the studies show it, is deadly poison and attacks fast-growing cells particularly and really zooms in, vectors in on the cerebral cortex and shows massive brain damage in children.
[00:18:47.645 --> 00:18:49.226]  We think it shouldn't be in the vaccines.
[00:18:49.286 --> 00:18:50.707]  We're radical, folks.
[00:18:52.853 --> 00:18:53.694]  We're radical.
[00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:55.195]  And bad.
[00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:58.618]  And so don't listen to us police officers out there.
[00:18:58.698 --> 00:18:59.379]  No, no, you're right.
[00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:00.280]  Cameras are good.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.541]  Black ski masks are good.
[00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:02.882]  Checkpoints are good.
[00:19:02.962 --> 00:19:03.863]  Open borders are good.
[00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:05.064]  All that's happening.
[00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:15.653]  And just so drink your Diet Coke and drink your tap water and laugh at us and give your child all those mercury shots and smile about it and win your child's in diapers at age 15 and
[00:19:17.012 --> 00:19:20.994]  And, you know, you wonder why your baby was healthy and happy and talking until you gave him the shots.
[00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:24.255]  Just remember the New World Order loves you and just laugh at us.
[00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:24.715]  Just do it.
[00:19:25.615 --> 00:19:26.195]  Just go ahead.
[00:19:27.496 --> 00:19:29.537]  And GM foods are good.
[00:19:29.677 --> 00:19:30.117]  Just eat them.
[00:19:31.797 --> 00:19:33.698]  And, I mean, I'm going to be honest.
[00:19:33.778 --> 00:19:35.899]  I still do some because I'm lazy and dumb just like you.
[00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:37.900]  Let's just be fat scum.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.400]  Good.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:39.980]  Good.
[00:19:40.341 --> 00:19:40.541]  Good.
[00:19:40.901 --> 00:19:41.061]  Good.
[00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:42.001]  I'm glad we're all in agreement.
[00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:45.102]  And the British government's not involved in London bombings.
[00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:46.583]  No, they're not.
[00:19:47.233 --> 00:19:48.894]  Even though we're going to give you the latest details on that.

[00:21:52.763 --> 00:21:55.664]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:13.023]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:13.063 --> 00:22:15.045]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:21.252]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:30.945 --> 00:22:36.568]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.

[00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:53.877]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:56.358]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.433 --> 00:24:18.639]  Did you know that in the last 10 years, the instances, the occurrence of cancer has doubled in the Western world?
[00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:25.705]  And it's a lot of different reasons and different things in the environment that are doing it.
[00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:31.069]  But a lot of the big ones are just the things that are in our food and water.
[00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.753]  And major studies out, aspartame, you know it is neutral, sweet, or equaled.
[00:24:37.273 --> 00:24:48.064]  In over 9,000 foods that you give your children, why the Pedialyte's got it, that causes, in major studies, all different types of cancers, like leukemia.
[00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:51.367]  Oh, here, let's give our baby Pedialyte.
[00:24:51.687 --> 00:24:58.874]  You ever wonder why it's all the stuff for the kids, why bottled water for babies says, fortified with fluoride?
[00:24:59.134 --> 00:25:01.016]  You ever notice that?
[00:25:01.036 --> 00:25:01.757]  Oh, or...
[00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:03.403]  Fortified.
[00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:06.184]  Fortified with aspartame.
[00:25:06.864 --> 00:25:07.404]  Mmm, it's good.
[00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:12.186]  And again, you just can't get your minds around that this is population control.
[00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:16.887]  You can't get your minds around it, that it's premeditated evil people in the government.
[00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:19.308]  You just cannot believe it.
[00:25:19.688 --> 00:25:21.268]  You cannot face it.
[00:25:21.308 --> 00:25:23.329]  You cannot deal with it.
[00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:26.490]  They know good and well what DU's going to do to Iraq.
[00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:30.740]  What it's going to do to Serbia and surrounding areas, to Afghanistan.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.401]  They know what it's going to do to our troops, and they don't care.
[00:25:34.182 --> 00:25:40.024]  It'll be in the newspaper here and there in a few years, but nobody will get in trouble that DU is killing the troops en masse.
[00:25:40.064 --> 00:25:42.865]  It already is in the newspapers that it's killing them from the first Gulf War.
[00:25:44.205 --> 00:25:45.906]  And by the way, we did confirm this report.
[00:25:46.306 --> 00:25:55.229]  The state of Louisiana is about to provide free health screening for all of the vets from Gulf War I and II for DU.
[00:25:56.013 --> 00:26:06.478]  And the New York Daily News last year did a blood test on the trips and found they all had high levels of DU in them and many of them are dying.
[00:26:07.158 --> 00:26:08.358]  But let's just ignore that.
[00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:10.679]  The government says it's good.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.081]  It doesn't matter if their own manual says it's deadly poison and radioactive.
[00:26:15.442 --> 00:26:17.903]  The government says never mind that.
[00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:20.924]  That's a lie of Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:23.842]  Just give up all your freedom.
[00:26:24.122 --> 00:26:25.882]  You know, I was thinking about private property.
[00:26:26.182 --> 00:26:28.423]  Private property is incredibly rare.
[00:26:30.304 --> 00:26:45.149]  In ancient societies, and even medieval societies, and feudal societies, just 400, 500 years ago, 300 years ago, private property, even in those societies, was a very small class of nobles.
[00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:47.610]  That were allowed to own property.
[00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:50.813]  And then even they only really rented it.
[00:26:51.174 --> 00:26:54.036]  They had to pay tribute to the sovereign or the king.
[00:26:55.517 --> 00:27:05.867]  And then about 250 years ago, in areas of Europe, the nobles began, in many cases, getting into trouble, getting decadent, getting dumbed down, getting corrupt.
[00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:10.711]  And they would loan out their property on loans.
[00:27:11.488 --> 00:27:12.790]  To goldsmiths and others.
[00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:19.978]  And so goldsmiths got a lot of power, the pawn shops, and so they were able to get laws changed where commoners could own property.
[00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:26.305]  And then some people who weren't goldsmiths actually got to buy some private property as well.
[00:27:26.465 --> 00:27:29.769]  And then now we have the goldsmiths who replace the royalty.
[00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:31.591]  They're the international bankers.
[00:27:32.433 --> 00:27:35.534]  And they now are like kings.
[00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:36.815]  Their families are.
[00:27:36.835 --> 00:27:40.756]  There's a few families allied with some of the old royalty that still got money.
[00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:44.657]  And they're going after the general public being able to own private property.
[00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:53.301]  So private property has been this incredibly rare, incredibly precious, unknown thing until about 250 years ago.
[00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:53.601]  Just unknown.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.783]  He would live, basically, as a sharecropper, as a steward, on the land for the Lord.
[00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:05.964]  The Lord.
[00:28:06.024 --> 00:28:08.285]  Imagine having to call someone Lord.
[00:28:08.685 --> 00:28:09.906]  What do we call God Lord?
[00:28:10.226 --> 00:28:12.167]  The Lord!
[00:28:12.727 --> 00:28:13.908]  Oh, there's no tyranny.
[00:28:14.168 --> 00:28:15.789]  Again, our schools teach there's no tyranny.
[00:28:15.829 --> 00:28:16.429]  Government's good.
[00:28:16.469 --> 00:28:17.230]  Give up all your rights.
[00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.290]  Submit to everything.
[00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.831]  Anyone that questions the government is bad.
[00:28:21.112 --> 00:28:23.453]  All our founding fathers said was don't trust the government.
[00:28:23.733 --> 00:28:25.314]  All they said was guard your liberty.
[00:28:26.935 --> 00:28:27.835]  Okay, here's what's coming up.
[00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:28.756]  And we're going to go to...
[00:28:30.137 --> 00:28:33.598]  Darren and Rodney and everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:28:35.078 --> 00:28:38.319]  Georgia claims Russia behind February bombings.
[00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:39.579]  That's the Moscow news.
[00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:40.580]  The evidence shows it.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.801]  Roger Portman, Laden wants to poison the cocaine.
[00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:47.361]  This is the biggest piece of propaganda I've ever seen in my life.
[00:28:48.522 --> 00:28:50.842]  Pentagon blocks release of Abu Ghraib images.
[00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:51.723]  Oh, I wonder why.
[00:28:51.743 --> 00:28:54.383]  I thought they were just blowing off steam, having some fun.
[00:28:54.663 --> 00:28:55.203]  Killing people.
[00:28:55.724 --> 00:28:57.024]  Joseph Mingle was doing that too.
[00:28:57.685 --> 00:29:00.487]  Brazilians demand arrest over killing.
[00:29:01.508 --> 00:29:12.637]  Hundreds of relatives and friends of the Brazilian man shot to death in London after being mistaken for a terrorist marched along the cobblestone streets of his hometown Monday demanding the arrest of the British policeman who fired the fatal shots.
[00:29:13.698 --> 00:29:15.720]  That might happen in Brazil, but not in England.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.821]  They're sovereigns over there.
[00:29:17.861 --> 00:29:18.882]  They're gods.
[00:29:19.463 --> 00:29:21.164]  Over there, the government is God.
[00:29:21.664 --> 00:29:23.006]  The Queen is God.
[00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:24.767]  And the people lick boot.
[00:29:25.568 --> 00:29:27.129]  Now they didn't until just a few years ago
[00:29:28.129 --> 00:29:34.095]  Since Runnymede in 1214 and then the Renaissance and developments in the last few hundred years, that wasn't the case.
[00:29:34.115 --> 00:29:36.678]  But no, now the government is God again.
[00:29:36.698 --> 00:29:40.702]  They've declaimed the tyrannical right of kings, just like our government.
[00:29:41.403 --> 00:29:43.866]  Our Attorney General has said, Bush is the law.
[00:29:44.286 --> 00:29:47.510]  He is literally King George III.
[00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:48.611]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.411 --> 00:29:52.313]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.793 --> 00:29:54.416]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.317 --> 00:29:58.001]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.084 --> 00:30:03.645]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:07.267]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:30:07.387 --> 00:30:07.767]  Shocking?
[00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:08.328]  Of course!
[00:30:08.608 --> 00:30:10.669]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.710]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.271]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:19.693]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott's Ph.D.

[00:31:01.019 --> 00:31:09.285]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.526 --> 00:31:13.909]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[00:32:41.764 --> 00:32:44.805]  You won't find a better selection of books or videos anywhere.

[00:33:05.951 --> 00:33:07.852]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:11.214]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.616 --> 00:33:33.168]  You know, our ancestors had to bow, had to kneel to the local noble, the local lord, and his henchmen, his minions, his local sheriff, and the motley crew that served the sheriff.
[00:33:34.494 --> 00:33:36.135]  And that was always hereditary.
[00:33:36.836 --> 00:33:47.804]  Imagine 20 generations of spoiled brats walking around with their policeman necklace and policeman hat on their heads.
[00:33:49.065 --> 00:33:58.853]  Oh, we're the constables shoving people around, having their way with your daughters, beating up your sons.
[00:34:00.091 --> 00:34:02.352]  I mean, don't your bones remember it?
[00:34:02.892 --> 00:34:04.433]  Doesn't your blood remember it?
[00:34:04.473 --> 00:34:05.813]  Doesn't your guts remember it?
[00:34:06.894 --> 00:34:08.935]  It hasn't been that long for blacks.
[00:34:10.295 --> 00:34:12.436]  Oh, no, it hasn't been that long for blacks.
[00:34:12.476 --> 00:34:14.737]  What, just 30, 40 years ago?
[00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:16.618]  Can't drink out of that water fountain?
[00:34:17.778 --> 00:34:19.519]  Can't come in here and get a sandwich?
[00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:24.621]  You've got to come around the back and go, Can I please have a sandwich?
[00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:27.502]  Sure, we'll get you something when we feel like it.
[00:34:29.036 --> 00:34:34.321]  Yeah, you had to go around and try to find a colored bathroom.
[00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:35.882]  And of course, normally they didn't have those.
[00:34:37.724 --> 00:34:41.187]  Fifty years ago, I mean, a big building might have one bathroom, period.
[00:34:41.407 --> 00:34:44.350]  So they had to go hide out in the woods or hold it.
[00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.732]  See, these are systems of control.
[00:34:47.232 --> 00:34:49.374]  So don't tell me we don't have tyranny.
[00:34:49.574 --> 00:34:52.196]  And don't tell me I shouldn't be upset and angry.
[00:34:52.377 --> 00:34:55.940]  And don't tell me I shouldn't be wanting to defend my liberties and my freedoms.
[00:34:57.615 --> 00:35:02.897]  All of these checkpoints, all of these roadblocks, it's about training you to be a slave.
[00:35:03.257 --> 00:35:05.438]  Training you to line up and take orders.
[00:35:05.778 --> 00:35:07.219]  Training you to be afraid.
[00:35:08.399 --> 00:35:10.920]  Training you to feel second class.
[00:35:13.261 --> 00:35:17.243]  And the government calls themselves authorities, officials.
[00:35:17.643 --> 00:35:19.183]  You never hear servant anymore.
[00:35:21.264 --> 00:35:24.125]  You see, in America, it was the first time they were called servants.
[00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:25.386]  First time.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:36.084]  Before that, it was officials, authorities, lords, noblemen.
[00:35:38.646 --> 00:35:41.207]  And it was the same in Japan as the same in England.
[00:35:42.027 --> 00:35:53.173]  Bowing your heads, being quiet, not standing up, not speaking out, engineering you to be domesticated, good little slaves that follow orders.
[00:35:56.101 --> 00:36:04.868]  And now America has such prosperity, such plenty, that we became decadent and sordid and forgot where we came from.
[00:36:04.988 --> 00:36:17.278]  And now we've gone from the strongest and the smartest in the world to, I've looked at all the statistics, the fattest, the dumbest, the most mindless, the most uneducated, drooling fools on average.
[00:36:17.818 --> 00:36:18.419]  On average.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:20.881]  On average.
[00:36:22.449 --> 00:36:26.117]  I mean, my father, growing up on a farm, he can fix anything.
[00:36:26.137 --> 00:36:27.700]  He's got a work ethic.
[00:36:28.341 --> 00:36:29.784]  He'll work 18 hours a day.
[00:36:29.844 --> 00:36:31.327]  He'll help you any way he can.
[00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:32.129]  He's incredible.
[00:36:33.556 --> 00:36:43.059]  And then I remember his dad and his mother, their work ethic, family was everything, just what they would do, just never complaining.
[00:36:43.459 --> 00:36:44.439]  And then I look at myself.
[00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:45.480]  I don't know how to fix it.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.681]  My dad tried to teach me, but I had TV, see, and I was hanging out with the other kids.
[00:36:49.901 --> 00:36:54.982]  He tried to teach me how to fix things, how to do things, and I know a lot of stuff, more than most, but nothing compared to him.
[00:36:57.083 --> 00:36:58.663]  And then I look at the young people today.
[00:36:58.724 --> 00:37:00.224]  I mean, they don't know anything.
[00:37:00.936 --> 00:37:01.557]  But you know what?
[00:37:01.977 --> 00:37:10.384]  One of these cops or one of these yuppies or one of these know-it-alls, they'll argue with you and tell you all about the Iraq War and tell you all about WNDs.
[00:37:10.504 --> 00:37:15.668]  And folks, they don't know where the state capital is in the bordering state.
[00:37:15.888 --> 00:37:18.590]  They don't know who their state representative is in their district.
[00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.312]  They don't know who their federal representative is.
[00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:22.493]  They don't know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[00:37:22.814 --> 00:37:26.336]  I use the example, most Americans in major polls cannot find Iraq on a map.
[00:37:26.717 --> 00:37:28.198]  Adults can't find it!
[00:37:28.378 --> 00:37:29.279]  They don't know how!
[00:37:30.663 --> 00:37:32.465]  I can find almost everything on a map.
[00:37:32.765 --> 00:37:39.171]  And I'm dumb compared to just normal middle class ancestors I had.
[00:37:39.371 --> 00:37:42.313]  Have you tried to read a newspaper from 100 years ago?
[00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.156]  The words are 14 feet long.
[00:37:45.276 --> 00:37:46.377]  I can't read half of them.
[00:37:46.437 --> 00:37:48.018]  I'm a blithering moron.
[00:37:49.419 --> 00:37:50.761]  And see, that's why I'm freaked out, folks.
[00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:54.844]  I don't have some sardonic view because I'm more informed than 99.9% of people.
[00:37:56.619 --> 00:37:57.360]  I'm freaked out.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:03.064]  I'm just a normal good old boy who's street smart and knows history.
[00:38:04.425 --> 00:38:07.127]  And I sit here and I watch the attitudes of these people.
[00:38:08.308 --> 00:38:12.511]  And I see history repeating itself and classical tyranny being put into place.
[00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:14.012]  We're going to go to Paul Watson with an update.
[00:38:14.032 --> 00:38:17.874]  Then we're going to go to Derek and Roger and many others that are holding toll-free numbers to join us.
[00:38:17.894 --> 00:38:18.675]  1-800-259-9231 Before I go to Paul...
[00:38:23.638 --> 00:38:29.120]  The time has come, the time is now, to stop procrastinating and order my documentary films.
[00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:34.622]  The rumors end, the documentation begins.
[00:38:35.903 --> 00:38:46.967]  And the best videos I produced are 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and then my newest, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, and both those videos are miniseries.
[00:38:47.488 --> 00:38:50.849]  One is three hours long, the other is almost three hours long, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:38:51.676 --> 00:38:58.821]  And they all cover, they all are mini-docs, strung together, connected, giving you the big picture, and then also zooming in to detail.
[00:38:59.242 --> 00:39:12.852]  It's the history of governments carrying out terror to blame it on their enemies, and how they carried out 9-11, and yeah, it takes two films to cover it, and you'll be an expert, and your neighbors will be experts, and if you haven't gotten the videos, please get them, please make copies, please get them out to people.
[00:39:14.113 --> 00:39:15.694]  It also makes this broadcast possible.
[00:39:16.252 --> 00:39:17.913]  You can call toll-free to get the films.
[00:39:17.953 --> 00:39:19.294]  They can answer all your questions.
[00:39:19.914 --> 00:39:22.856]  Or they can tell you about all the different discounts.
[00:39:23.036 --> 00:39:27.958]  Over 75% off on some of our best videos like American Dictators right now.
[00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:31.500]  Huge discounts on all the films and you get multiple copies.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.741]  We want you to get the word out.
[00:39:33.682 --> 00:39:34.942]  Here's the toll-free number to order.
[00:39:34.962 --> 00:39:35.022]  1-888-253-3139
[00:39:43.146 --> 00:39:47.829]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:39:49.571 --> 00:40:02.540]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001-3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:09.024]  And the best way to order the videos, you can watch video clips of them, lengthy clips.
[00:40:09.064 --> 00:40:11.586]  I mean, I got half of Marshall off on InfoWars for free.
[00:40:11.606 --> 00:40:11.706]  Ha!
[00:40:12.762 --> 00:40:16.663]  You can order them via the Safe Secure shopping cart, read about the films, look at all the different specials.
[00:40:16.943 --> 00:40:17.964]  And I've got a whole bookstore.
[00:40:17.984 --> 00:40:19.504]  I've got a bunch of other videos we carry.
[00:40:20.345 --> 00:40:23.065]  Like the new one about chemical and biological testing on U.S.
[00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:24.606]  cribs and the American people.
[00:40:24.726 --> 00:40:26.006]  All the public admissions.
[00:40:26.026 --> 00:40:31.668]  You can watch the trailer right there on Infowars.com for Beyond Treason.
[00:40:32.268 --> 00:40:35.329]  Joyce Riley and others have put out.
[00:40:35.389 --> 00:40:36.830]  Her great director.
[00:40:38.851 --> 00:40:39.431]  William Lewis.
[00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:45.042]  I hope that you get that video that we're now offering that just came out.
[00:40:45.883 --> 00:40:49.886]  So InfoWars.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:40:50.106 --> 00:41:02.818]  And last but not least, Paul Watson, the guy that runs it for us, along with Steve Watson, along with Dwayne Coots, we have PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:02.878 --> 00:41:06.941]  Paul, before we get into London and the latest developments, tell folks in a nutshell about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:14.236]  Well, it's probably the best subscription website of its kind out there.
[00:41:15.437 --> 00:41:36.069]  Every one of your documentary films in full different formats, dialogue, broadband, every major audio interview from the Alex Jones Show, my book, your book, weekly reports, well, it's not even weekly, it's normally two a week, so we've got an entire library of those reports up there.
[00:41:36.089 --> 00:41:36.990]  TV reports, yeah.
[00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:40.300]  Since we started the website April last year.
[00:41:41.261 --> 00:41:46.383]  We just added Loose Change, which is one of the latest 9-11 films.
[00:41:46.443 --> 00:41:47.263]  That's excellent.
[00:41:47.803 --> 00:41:53.386]  We added the Hate Crimes video, so we've got dozens of videos by other authors as well.
[00:41:54.126 --> 00:42:02.170]  So for 15 cents a day, if you subscribe for a year, you can just download everything and then cancel if that's what you want to do.
[00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.510]  You can get everything for $5.95.
[00:42:05.669 --> 00:42:06.069]  That's right.
[00:42:06.129 --> 00:42:12.492]  We have monthly subscriptions that are $5.95 or $0.19 a day, yearly subscriptions that are $0.15 a day.
[00:42:12.512 --> 00:42:14.752]  You basically get three months free when you do that.
[00:42:15.493 --> 00:42:21.575]  And, Paul, almost everybody that signed up over a year ago, 90-plus percent of them signed back up.
[00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:23.507]  That's right.
[00:42:23.728 --> 00:42:36.896]  I mean, you can cancel at any time, but it's an auto-renewal system, and the vast majority do keep renewing because they like the content that's already up there, and it continues to be added on a daily basis.
[00:42:37.737 --> 00:42:48.084]  Well, I mean, usually it's $5.95 or $10.95 a month just for one thing, you know, just to hear archives or something, which is still a good deal, but I mean, this is just everything.
[00:42:49.085 --> 00:42:49.265]  So...
[00:42:50.077 --> 00:42:51.198]  I hope folks take advantage of it.
[00:42:51.238 --> 00:42:53.619]  Paul, let's get into the guy they killed first.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.201]  Very suspicious, just everything surrounding this.
[00:42:58.141 --> 00:43:05.025]  The Brazilians are calling for the secret police to be arrested, who now we learned seven shots in the head and one in the chest.
[00:43:05.405 --> 00:43:06.886]  That's one Scotland Yard report.
[00:43:06.926 --> 00:43:10.668]  The other is they shot him just seven times in the head.
[00:43:10.868 --> 00:43:11.589]  Phil, sit on that.
[00:43:12.809 --> 00:43:14.690]  Well, it's actually eight times in the head.
[00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:17.712]  And this is the thing, because... Well, there's different reports.
[00:43:17.832 --> 00:43:19.613]  I wrote an article...
[00:43:20.287 --> 00:43:25.850]  There's a whole bunch of witnesses that said they shot him in the chest.
[00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.732]  Yeah, so I reported the discrepancy.
[00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:31.353]  If they think the guy's got a suicide bomb...
[00:43:49.446 --> 00:44:00.371]  And then there were other eyewitness reports of him wearing a bomb belt and wires coming out of his jacket, which were obviously planted now in the aftermath.
[00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:04.773]  Why would they shoot him in that area if it could have triggered the bomb?
[00:44:05.513 --> 00:44:07.954]  And then I got emails attacking me today saying...
[00:44:08.706 --> 00:44:10.147]  You misreported it.
[00:44:10.207 --> 00:44:11.809]  They shot him eight times in the head.
[00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:14.011]  You said they shot him in the back and torso.
[00:44:14.491 --> 00:44:19.636]  I was only relating what BBC and all the British papers were reporting on Friday.
[00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:25.682]  Well, Paul, it's time for you to write three or four paragraphs at the top because that story's linked everywhere and update that.
[00:44:26.286 --> 00:44:31.647]  Well yeah, the point is they just changed the story outright from shooting him in the back and torso to the head.
[00:44:31.707 --> 00:44:35.368]  In the space of two days they just changed the story.
[00:44:35.388 --> 00:44:37.288]  Because people were raising questions
[00:44:55.415 --> 00:44:58.877]  If they'd shot him in the chest, then they knew he didn't have a bomb.
[00:44:59.417 --> 00:45:00.737]  So they changed that to the head.
[00:45:01.378 --> 00:45:05.759]  I wish folks that were nitpicking at us would notice that we put that out the day after they killed him.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.660]  Or the day they killed him, excuse me.
[00:45:08.381 --> 00:45:10.101]  So I don't understand what they're talking about.
[00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:13.763]  The government said, the witnesses said, that they'd shot him in the chest.
[00:45:14.423 --> 00:45:16.584]  Then you point that out and they change the story.
[00:45:17.464 --> 00:45:18.465]  So it's just mindless.
[00:45:18.545 --> 00:45:19.525]  It's totally mindless.
[00:45:19.805 --> 00:45:21.186]  We also got attacked by Channel 4.
[00:45:22.509 --> 00:45:23.109]  We're good to go.
[00:45:48.894 --> 00:45:49.675]  Well, we haven't done this.
[00:45:50.315 --> 00:45:53.418]  One of the patsies they produced, it turns out, is the wrong person.
[00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:55.219]  Just like on 9-11.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.742]  So, I mean, it's just crazy the type of stuff they try to do.
[00:45:59.143 --> 00:46:09.471]  And then the very neocon blogs out there posing as liberals that attacked us for talking about the drills, well, they're now saying it's an inside job.
[00:46:10.332 --> 00:46:11.633]  So, it's amazing.
[00:46:13.034 --> 00:46:13.995]  Well, yeah, and then you've got...
[00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:20.381]  A grainy video, which has several discrepancies in that alone.
[00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:21.522]  Yeah, go over that video for folks.
[00:46:22.563 --> 00:46:26.344]  Well, yeah, it's the classic video shot of the four of them.
[00:46:26.364 --> 00:46:28.986]  I think it's exiting Luton.
[00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:37.710]  And the railings, which are behind the person who's walking in front of the camera, in places on his body, are in fact in front of his body.
[00:46:39.198 --> 00:46:42.279]  So it seems like a bad Photoshop job to say the least.
[00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:44.440]  Maybe those clues were meant to be put in there.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.140]  I don't see why they'd do it so sloppily.
[00:46:47.841 --> 00:46:59.064]  Kind of like this secondary attack which seems to me that it must have been a copycat because it was so sloppy in the way that none of the four bombs went off that
[00:47:00.098 --> 00:47:08.185]  You know, MI5 or whoever wouldn't make that kind of mistake, which is why Blair came out immediately after and basically said nothing to worry about.
[00:47:08.685 --> 00:47:27.721]  Contrast that with his statements after the first bombing, which was so carefully prepared, scripted and acted, then we can tell from that that this second attack or attempted attack seems to be a copycat exercise, if only to get questions about the first attack off the front pages of the newspapers.
[00:47:29.144 --> 00:47:44.276]  The major development over the weekend was that one of the eyewitnesses and police who were on the scene, yards away from the Aldgate train bombing, reported that the bomb was in fact under the train, wasn't in a backpack.
[00:47:45.277 --> 00:47:52.883]  We got the quote from the Cambridge Evening News, quote, the policeman said, mind that hole, that's where the bomb was.
[00:47:53.479 --> 00:47:57.161]  Metal was pushed upward as if the bomb was underneath the train.
[00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:03.704]  They seem to think the bomb was left in a bag, but I don't remember anybody being where the bomb was or any bag.
[00:48:04.465 --> 00:48:06.386]  Not from a witness who was yards away.
[00:48:07.507 --> 00:48:13.170]  So it obviously lends more weight to the inside job covered by the drill explanation.
[00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.071]  Well, you've got to go and article out on that too, Paul.
[00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:17.592]  And also what they do is...
[00:48:18.288 --> 00:48:22.089]  They skirted and hung grapes all over these trains and hauled them off secretly.
[00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:23.570]  Same thing with the bus.
[00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.190]  I mean, why not show us?
[00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:36.234]  I mean, when it is an actual terrorist doing something, which happens once in a blue moon occasionally in the West, more often in the Middle East, they will show you the aftermath.
[00:48:36.254 --> 00:48:37.734]  They will show you the carnage.
[00:48:38.434 --> 00:48:42.175]  But, in fact, in all these big IRA bombings, they would show up close wreckage.
[00:48:42.596 --> 00:48:43.876]  But they're not doing that here, Paul.
[00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:52.846]  Well, exactly, and we see all the CCTV shots of the bombers before the bombs went off, but no footage of the actual bombing.
[00:48:53.587 --> 00:48:58.415]  You compare that to 9-11, where the planes are flying into the towers a million times over.
[00:48:59.549 --> 00:49:08.515]  But the only way you can get that kind of access, obviously, this is what happened with Madrid, is to plant and secure the bomb underneath the train and not get caught in the act.
[00:49:08.715 --> 00:49:12.718]  If you have permission... Oh, that's what happened in Madrid!
[00:49:13.118 --> 00:49:13.498]  Exactly.
[00:49:13.518 --> 00:49:14.018]  That's right.
[00:49:14.058 --> 00:49:16.120]  The last point showed it was under the train.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.561]  Oh, Paul, you've got to get those photos and put all that together.
[00:49:19.582 --> 00:49:21.003]  We did get video of that.
[00:49:21.403 --> 00:49:25.686]  You'd have to have some kind of permission from London Underground to work under the train.
[00:49:26.226 --> 00:49:28.768]  Obviously, they would have been told it was part of the drill.
[00:49:29.808 --> 00:49:49.157]  Remember the article we had about the bus driver who said for security reasons they always had the same contract to inspect the cameras, but in the days before the 7-7 attack it was a different group and that they took two full days just to check the cameras at one bus station, you know, a job that normally takes hours.
[00:49:49.177 --> 00:49:57.881]  And then a day and a half before the 7-7 bombings in Sheffield where you live, they called in all the buses and were searching them for bombs and then tried to make up stories and lie about it.
[00:49:59.023 --> 00:50:08.807]  Yeah, so we have a situation whereby the Patsy bombers are told it's a drill, and even if they have real explosives loaded in their backpacks or not, it doesn't really matter.
[00:50:08.827 --> 00:50:09.968]  It doesn't really make a difference.
[00:50:10.028 --> 00:50:22.413]  I mean, you could have bombs in both the backpacks and underneath the train, because as we know, from all these kind of incidents, they like to have secondary devices in case the first ones don't work for whatever reason.
[00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:23.594]  Get rid of the Patsy, yeah.
[00:50:24.475 --> 00:50:29.516]  Yeah, so, I mean, the Patsies could have been on there, just with basic backpacks with no bombs in them.
[00:50:29.536 --> 00:50:30.637]  Well, it's like OKC.
[00:50:30.657 --> 00:50:34.778]  You've got the Ryder truck blows up and the bigger blast inside blows it all out across the street.
[00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:37.719]  9-11, planes crash, then the secondaries go off.
[00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:39.619]  It's always the same, Paul.
[00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:50.102]  Yeah, and obviously the chance that some of these Patsies could have escaped, therefore explaining the killings on 7-7 and with this Brazilian guy on Friday.
[00:50:51.084 --> 00:50:52.524]  Yeah, he looks so military.
[00:50:52.584 --> 00:50:54.325]  I mean, perfect double.
[00:50:55.165 --> 00:50:56.426]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:50:56.506 --> 00:50:58.826]  I want to get into the shooting, and then we'll take calls.
[00:50:58.846 --> 00:51:00.187]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.147 --> 00:51:05.508]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.688 --> 00:51:10.089]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.249 --> 00:51:14.631]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.651 --> 00:51:15.991]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.796 --> 00:51:22.017]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.077 --> 00:51:29.019]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:31.200]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:42.062]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:54:12.023 --> 00:54:17.026]  Immediately when we start the next hour, Paul Watson is going to be leaving us here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:17.386 --> 00:54:19.947]  Webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com and TV.
[00:54:21.188 --> 00:54:22.329]  Paul, this Brazilian.
[00:54:23.489 --> 00:54:30.333]  Now, I don't speculate a lot, but unfortunately when we do speculate, our hunches are normally correct.
[00:54:31.114 --> 00:54:32.454]  Look at all these different points.
[00:54:32.474 --> 00:54:34.075]  He looks like the military type.
[00:54:34.656 --> 00:54:36.036]  He's 27 years old.
[00:54:37.637 --> 00:54:38.858]  Very serious individual.
[00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:41.631]  Supposedly an electrician.
[00:54:42.772 --> 00:54:45.654]  He's looking like he's scared, running away.
[00:54:46.255 --> 00:54:49.958]  Special forces types run in, sit on him.
[00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:55.243]  As if he knows it's the end, they kill him.
[00:54:56.705 --> 00:54:57.125]  Okay?
[00:54:57.786 --> 00:55:04.172]  And then we have reports on day one, back on 7-7, of police shooting bombers where bombs didn't go off.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.641]  And that was in Reuters, folks.
[00:55:06.801 --> 00:55:10.664]  All of this going on, raids on houses, gunshots going off in houses.
[00:55:10.965 --> 00:55:16.128]  Some of the reports, these aren't even Arabs or Middle Easterners or Central Asians.
[00:55:16.148 --> 00:55:17.489]  You know, they're not Muslims.
[00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.151]  They're going into other people's houses.
[00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.974]  We know the globalists love to hire out of Central and South America.
[00:55:24.435 --> 00:55:32.441]  I don't know, but it's very suspicious that highly trained special police would just go shoot this guy so many times, you know...
[00:55:35.163 --> 00:55:39.407]  Well, that's right.
[00:55:39.427 --> 00:55:47.494]  I mean, the first impression of it is you've got 15 to 20, depending on what source you read.
[00:55:47.534 --> 00:55:48.414]  It could even be more.
[00:55:49.235 --> 00:55:50.536]  Plainclothes police.
[00:55:50.576 --> 00:55:51.937]  You don't even know they're police.
[00:55:52.498 --> 00:55:53.819]  Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
[00:55:53.899 --> 00:55:56.761]  But running towards you with guns shouting at you.
[00:55:57.101 --> 00:56:01.225]  This guy's from Brazil, which has one of the most corrupt police forces in the world.
[00:56:02.003 --> 00:56:02.544]  We're good to go.
[00:56:21.088 --> 00:56:29.312]  The apology comes out, but at the same time, the Metropolitan Police say, we are willing to kill more innocent people.
[00:56:29.732 --> 00:56:35.935]  Just blasé about it, out in the open, not even trying to justify their own actions.
[00:56:36.836 --> 00:56:44.599]  So, I mean, whether this guy was part of the drill or not, the basic story behind his death should really worry us all.
[00:56:44.639 --> 00:56:46.620]  I mean, if it had been a white guy born in
[00:56:47.407 --> 00:56:50.009]  England, then the uproar would have been massive.
[00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:53.051]  But as it is, nobody seems to care.
[00:56:55.172 --> 00:56:58.054]  Well, I mean, I did hear it yesterday on the radio.
[00:56:58.094 --> 00:57:06.659]  I did hear Blair, the police chief, same name as the prime minister, folks, saying, well, it's sad it happened, but we'll do it again.
[00:57:06.719 --> 00:57:07.520]  And Blair said that.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.941]  We've got to get that on tape, by the way, Paul.
[00:57:09.637 --> 00:57:11.318]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:57:11.378 --> 00:57:12.299]  So nobody's safe.
[00:57:12.879 --> 00:57:18.563]  Paul, on Friday, folks should be looking for some special reports here on the show, shouldn't they?
[00:57:20.024 --> 00:57:21.565]  That's right, yeah.
[00:57:22.745 --> 00:57:29.230]  We're going to get up close and personal to say the least to this entire story and really get to the heart of the matter.
[00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:37.715]  So whereas we were just looking in from the outside, this weekend is going to be hardcore documentation.
[00:57:39.187 --> 00:57:40.087]  Down there in London.
[00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:44.268]  Well, Paul, I wish you luck over there.
[00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:48.869]  All right, well, I appreciate you.
[00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:51.830]  Bro, anything else in the last 60 seconds of this hour?
[00:57:52.710 --> 00:58:03.733]  Well, we put out a Warning to the World article about a week, 10 days ago, calling on governments to expose government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:07.994]  So it's interesting today that... We've had Iran and Georgia do it.
[00:58:08.692 --> 00:58:16.097]  Yeah, Georgian government has come out and said that Russia has been engaging in terrorism to try and destabilize their government.
[00:58:16.818 --> 00:58:25.004]  So, either by proxy or not, maybe by the 100-month monkey syndrome, then people are really starting to speak out about state-sponsored terror.
[00:58:25.704 --> 00:58:30.988]  Yeah, and Iran, one of their top leaders, he didn't say Israel, he said the British government.
[00:58:31.588 --> 00:58:31.889]  Right.
[00:58:31.969 --> 00:58:32.869]  Which was really different.
[00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.751]  All right, Paul, good job, and...
[00:58:35.914 --> 00:58:36.614]  Toodle-oo!
[00:58:36.654 --> 00:58:37.375]  See you soon!
[00:58:37.395 --> 00:58:38.035]  See ya.
[00:58:38.335 --> 00:58:39.156]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:46.339 --> 00:58:46.820]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:47.880]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.021]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:54.103]  You want answers?
[00:58:54.243 --> 00:58:56.345]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.427 --> 00:59:09.028]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:15.509]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:20.991]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two.
[00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:26.612]  It is the 26th day of July 2005.
[00:59:26.692 --> 00:59:28.253]  Wide open phones in this hour.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.260]  And I want to talk more about the London bombing.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.141]  Why are we spending so much time on this?
[00:59:36.601 --> 00:59:46.923]  Another example of problem reaction solution by government, and just all the lies we've caught them in, the clear evidence that government's behind it.
[00:59:47.924 --> 00:59:53.745]  Just like on 9-11, this stuff is really being hyped up and used for effect, and we've got to expose it.
[00:59:55.786 --> 01:00:12.433]  Also, a lot of new developments coming out concerning the police state here in the United States, as well as genetically engineered foods, and what's happening with some of the chemicals and things they're putting into our foods and our water.
[01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:15.914]  Just a mass of important news coming up in this hour.
[01:00:15.954 --> 01:00:17.975]  But right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:00:18.095 --> 01:00:19.336]  Derek in Kansas City.
[01:00:19.376 --> 01:00:20.036]  Go ahead, Derek.
[01:00:20.603 --> 01:00:21.604]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:22.384]  How you doing?
[01:00:22.444 --> 01:00:23.545]  I'm a huge fan.
[01:00:23.605 --> 01:00:24.505]  I'm a new listener.
[01:00:24.525 --> 01:00:25.866]  Well, good to have you on board, sir.
[01:00:26.086 --> 01:00:30.109]  Well, I wanted to thank you for the work you and Paul are doing because it's really good stuff.
[01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:33.831]  What I want to talk to you about was I saw this article.
[01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:37.353]  It was on Yahoo, but it was actually a link for the Seattle Times.
[01:00:37.693 --> 01:00:42.576]  And the headline was, Effort here to charge London suspects was blocked.
[01:00:42.996 --> 01:00:49.159]  And it's about how this Haroon Aswat was prosecutors...
[01:00:50.379 --> 01:01:01.508]  Were blocked in their efforts to charge him with involvement in a case having to do with a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon in 1999.
[01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:05.091]  And higher-ups let him go.
[01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:08.454]  He was going to be charged and they let him go.
[01:01:08.614 --> 01:01:15.179]  And now he has been, they're saying in London that he has been in contact with two of the four so-called suicide bombers.
[01:01:15.902 --> 01:01:17.903]  In days and hours before the attack.
[01:01:17.923 --> 01:01:21.945]  You know, I saw that article, and for some reason didn't print it or didn't bring it.
[01:01:22.425 --> 01:01:23.005]  Email that.
[01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:24.506]  Go to prisonplanet.com.
[01:01:24.826 --> 01:01:25.186]  Okay.
[01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:30.328]  And email that article to Paul from the Seattle Times, and we'll do something on it.
[01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:32.209]  But, sir, this is the same M.O.
[01:01:32.269 --> 01:01:32.769]  every time.
[01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:39.032]  Listen, I have articles from the late 90s from Alabama and North Carolina.
[01:01:40.115 --> 01:01:42.236]  One of these was in the Austin American Statesman.
[01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.596]  It was Black Helicopters Scare Public.
[01:01:45.256 --> 01:01:50.158]  Separate article than the articles on the front page of the paper about drills in Texas.
[01:01:51.018 --> 01:01:55.499]  And it described just thousands of Arabs at these bases in Alabama and North Carolina.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.561]  And how the blacked out windows on the buses would drive into these camps and there would be explosions and machine guns.
[01:02:03.221 --> 01:02:08.543]  And then the locals would talk to the military that was training them and talk to the Arabs at the local diner.
[01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.539]  And they would go, yeah, we're training to be terrorists.
[01:02:11.939 --> 01:02:12.239]  What?
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.863]  And so, there are terrorist training camps up in the mountains of California.
[01:02:21.129 --> 01:02:23.170]  They fire machine guns, explode bombs.
[01:02:23.651 --> 01:02:24.991]  Locals complain.
[01:02:25.512 --> 01:02:27.933]  News cameras show video of their encampments.
[01:02:27.973 --> 01:02:29.054]  The police don't rate them.
[01:02:29.574 --> 01:02:31.495]  They have terror training camps that you just mentioned.
[01:02:31.535 --> 01:02:32.856]  I've seen that in Oregon.
[01:02:33.636 --> 01:02:35.998]  Nothing because this is CIA, sir.
[01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:36.758]  Yeah.
[01:02:37.238 --> 01:02:37.859]  You understand?
[01:02:38.239 --> 01:02:39.780]  Listen, we have Mexican troops.
[01:02:40.504 --> 01:02:45.726]  Training by the hundreds at different ranches in South Texas openly.
[01:02:46.127 --> 01:02:49.448]  Los Zetas is expanding its force, and it's all government-run.
[01:02:50.348 --> 01:02:53.890]  And then they go out and kill all the CIA's competition for drug dealing.
[01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:57.892]  And then you read the local newspapers, and they go, yeah, they used to work for the U.S.
[01:02:57.912 --> 01:03:01.153]  government until a few months ago, and now they're out killing everybody.
[01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:04.095]  But the Border Patrol's been ordered not to shoot back at them.
[01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:05.975]  They work for the globalists.
[01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:06.756]  They're mercs.
[01:03:07.816 --> 01:03:11.459]  Folks, the criminality has gotten so insane now.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.241]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:17.683]  And if you go through the article, there's so many contradictions.
[01:03:18.244 --> 01:03:19.405]  No, I know.
[01:03:19.705 --> 01:03:19.905]  I know.
[01:03:19.945 --> 01:03:20.305]  I read it.
[01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:25.789]  They'll report that this guy's protected by the government, but now he's with terrorists, and not go, hmm, I wonder why.
[01:03:25.809 --> 01:03:26.870]  Exactly.
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.710]  Stinks.
[01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:30.613]  Give folks that headline in case they missed it.
[01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:31.693]  I will do that.
[01:03:32.254 --> 01:03:33.575]  Do you have the headline in front of you?
[01:03:34.255 --> 01:03:34.795]  Yes, I do.
[01:03:34.816 --> 01:03:34.896]  It's...
[01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:41.799]  seattletimes.nwsource.com No, no, no.
[01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:43.040]  What's the physical title?
[01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.282]  Oh, the headline itself?
[01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:46.063]  Yes.
[01:03:46.904 --> 01:03:49.726]  Effort here to charge London suspect was blocked.
[01:03:49.967 --> 01:03:50.647]  All right, thank you.
[01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:51.208]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.022 --> 01:03:56.886]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:13.125]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.305 --> 01:04:16.165]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.225 --> 01:04:20.907]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[01:07:28.247 --> 01:07:29.328]  Coming up, Georgia.
[01:07:30.319 --> 01:07:31.940]  That's not the Georgia Beach, folks.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.081]  That's the Eastern Block.
[01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:39.165]  Georgia claims Russia behind February bombing.
[01:07:39.845 --> 01:07:45.209]  FSB caught blowing up buildings before, and they think that they're using it to destabilize the country.
[01:07:46.369 --> 01:07:50.092]  Bin Laden had planned to sell poison cocaine to America in 2002.
[01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:53.654]  Total, total propaganda.
[01:07:54.194 --> 01:07:57.837]  Pentagon Block's release of Abu Ghraib images will tell you why.
[01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:03.295]  And the Brazilians demanding arrest over killing of their citizen, more like execution.
[01:08:04.016 --> 01:08:05.056]  It's all coming up.
[01:08:05.136 --> 01:08:07.957]  Right now, though, let's go to Ron.
[01:08:09.918 --> 01:08:10.838]  Ron's not up next.
[01:08:10.998 --> 01:08:12.979]  Actually, Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:08:13.019 --> 01:08:13.779]  Go ahead, Roger.
[01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.259]  Yes, thanks, Alex.
[01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:26.783]  I'd like to pound out the toll-free to Das Kapital Hill switchboard, der Home of Homeland Hitler, to fight the capital bill and the other evil de jures as they arise.
[01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:33.024]  And I've been wanting to say forever now, Alex, your opening monologues should quite often be bronze.
[01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:35.285]  They're good, so I pertain.
[01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:38.206]  I don't know about that, but thank you for the compliment, Roger.
[01:08:38.226 --> 01:08:43.489]  Hey, and when you call to oppose CAPTA, use language like that one cancer doctor.
[01:08:43.549 --> 01:08:54.234]  Tell them that if CAPTA passes, that if they fail to convince their fellow congressmen to oppose it, and because of its Codex compliance provisions, that is Codex Alimentarius,
[01:08:55.373 --> 01:08:57.775]  Well, again, for those that don't know, CAFTA is thousands of pages long.
[01:09:21.736 --> 01:09:23.718]  And it literally merges our government.
[01:09:23.738 --> 01:09:25.319]  And I've read much of the document.
[01:09:25.339 --> 01:09:33.325]  It says, in the international bodies, international treaties, international agreements, and then any treaties they sign, we then come under those.
[01:09:33.766 --> 01:09:35.107]  So it's global government.
[01:09:36.087 --> 01:09:38.509]  Yeah, okay, now the toll-free again is 877-762-8762 again.
[01:09:46.429 --> 01:09:52.895]  877-762-8762 and call every day at least once a day.
[01:09:53.015 --> 01:09:57.019]  Call locally as well as the Washington number I just gave you.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.702]  We're talking about just in a day or two.
[01:10:01.803 --> 01:10:03.265]  Possibly Thursday afternoon.
[01:10:03.305 --> 01:10:03.745]  You never know.
[01:10:03.805 --> 01:10:05.186]  It might be rolled up to Wednesday.
[01:10:05.246 --> 01:10:05.847]  God bless you all.
[01:10:06.443 --> 01:10:07.043]  Yeah, take care.
[01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:09.504]  We had Ron Paul's office on Friday talking about it.
[01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:16.027]  In the aftermath of the Patriot Act passing last Thursday, and Bush said, see, there have been more bombings in London.
[01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:17.127]  We've got to have this.
[01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:20.649]  But they leave our perimeters.
[01:10:21.753 --> 01:10:22.774]  Wide open.
[01:10:22.834 --> 01:10:34.239]  But, oh, we've got to have more cameras in America and more checkpoints and more police searching you, and you just better learn to follow orders or the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:10:34.299 --> 01:10:39.661]  And the government hates making you their slaves, but they've got to make you prisoners for your own good.
[01:10:41.082 --> 01:10:42.283]  Kyle in California.
[01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:42.923]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[01:10:44.116 --> 01:10:46.879]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:10:47.019 --> 01:10:53.248]  I disconnected from the internet and I haven't been able to keep up with you that often, but apparently you're following me out here.
[01:10:53.268 --> 01:10:55.211]  I'm seeing you all over the place.
[01:10:55.231 --> 01:10:58.355]  You're getting quoted in editorials in the paper.
[01:10:58.715 --> 01:11:00.778]  Not correctly, but your name's out there.
[01:11:02.089 --> 01:11:04.290]  I look forward to hearing you on Coast to Coast this weekend.
[01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:06.351]  What do you mean I got quoted in the newspaper?
[01:11:07.051 --> 01:11:23.596]  This guy was talking about the Bohemian Grove, and he quoted you as saying that you said that they were sacrificing children in there, and I know from your videos that you say it's an effigy, but that's where it came in.
[01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.277]  What paper was that?
[01:11:25.837 --> 01:11:27.818]  The local paper, the Press Democrat.
[01:11:28.772 --> 01:11:29.172]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:29.212 --> 01:11:31.193]  The Press Democrat's always attacking me.
[01:11:31.213 --> 01:11:32.333]  So you're in Santa Rosa?
[01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:33.394]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:33.474 --> 01:11:33.694]  Yes.
[01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:38.336]  Well, write a letter to the editor and say, I listened to Alex Jones.
[01:11:38.596 --> 01:11:39.536]  I got his phone number.
[01:11:39.576 --> 01:11:40.317]  I'm going to call him.
[01:11:40.617 --> 01:11:43.118]  Believe me, I'm a uniquely American.
[01:11:43.138 --> 01:11:43.938]  I have three jobs.
[01:11:44.278 --> 01:11:45.539]  I'm doing all I can, brother.
[01:11:45.599 --> 01:11:46.759]  Yeah, that's what Bush said.
[01:11:46.799 --> 01:11:48.280]  That lady goes, I got three jobs.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.580]  He goes, good, good.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.701]  That's what you're supposed to have.
[01:11:51.081 --> 01:11:51.961]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:52.902]  I'm in that book.
[01:11:55.602 --> 01:12:04.965]  You know, I've called you a few times, and this is where I come when I got the really hard questions, because there's a lot of people around here that agree so much with what you're dropping.
[01:12:06.325 --> 01:12:13.087]  The new judge and this Federalist Society connection, I was wondering if you know any nefarious...
[01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:27.475]  Well, I mean, it's another think tank that claims it's conservative, and it might have been 20 years ago, but it's gotten more neocon-ish like everything else.
[01:12:27.495 --> 01:12:34.362]  I mean, I gotta tell you, Judge Roberts, at least on the surface, is better than Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:12:34.941 --> 01:12:39.106]  I mean, Gonzalez is a member of a racist hate group, METCHA.
[01:12:39.907 --> 01:12:43.651]  He says Bush is above the law and is the law.
[01:12:43.671 --> 01:12:45.954]  He actually said in memos, Bush is sovereign.
[01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.115]  Bush is the law.
[01:12:47.135 --> 01:12:49.157]  Which, folks, that's not the case.
[01:12:49.358 --> 01:12:55.705]  If Bush was the law, he could barbecue small children on the front lawn of the White House and not get in trouble.
[01:12:56.709 --> 01:13:00.133]  Let me just finish the answer.
[01:13:01.054 --> 01:13:09.145]  With Roberts, his wife is on a bunch of big boards with defense contractors and others, big neocon outfits.
[01:13:09.165 --> 01:13:12.048]  She's making masses of money off that, conflict of interest.
[01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:16.494]  He was one of the top lawyers in the first Bush White House.
[01:13:17.235 --> 01:13:18.796]  He was then a solicitor general.
[01:13:19.337 --> 01:13:31.226]  And so he's been a very powerful puppet of theirs for 20 years, just like Gonzalez was their Enron lawyer and then got Bush's DWI record expunged.
[01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:36.751]  So Roberts is bad news, and he's not a real conservative.
[01:13:37.391 --> 01:13:37.892]  But go ahead.
[01:13:38.522 --> 01:13:43.267]  Well, excuse me, it's like picking between Kerry and Bush, though.
[01:13:43.287 --> 01:13:51.214]  I mean, the game is so rigged, we don't even have a choice in the public discourse if any of us chose to put our name behind it.
[01:13:51.234 --> 01:13:51.715]  Well, that's right.
[01:13:51.735 --> 01:13:58.641]  When he was advising the first Bush, Herbert Walker, the 41st, you know, King George I...
[01:13:59.986 --> 01:14:02.628]  When he was advising him, they're making all those papers secret.
[01:14:03.028 --> 01:14:05.050]  They won't even release the advice he gave them.
[01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:08.252]  Now they're saying they might release a page or something.
[01:14:08.292 --> 01:14:10.354]  It's ridiculous.
[01:14:10.834 --> 01:14:21.783]  I can just tell you, just as far as you're talking about Zarqawi in Iraq, there's a reporter who's on this supposed left,
[01:14:22.373 --> 01:14:23.273]  Well, I appreciate the call.
[01:14:23.313 --> 01:14:23.773]  Thank you.
[01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:24.374]  God bless you.
[01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:25.934]  No, write a letter to the editor.
[01:14:25.954 --> 01:14:34.257]  It's better if it comes from you than from I. Because, you know, for myself, because if you, you know, I mean, if I write a letter to the editor, they might not publish it.
[01:14:34.277 --> 01:14:35.177]  I haven't even seen the article.
[01:14:35.297 --> 01:14:35.877]  I know that
[01:14:51.966 --> 01:14:58.111]  The San Francisco Chronicle has written articles this year mentioning what I've done, and I didn't know about the Press Democrat.
[01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:00.053]  Somebody might email that to me.
[01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:00.974]  That would always be nice.
[01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:04.337]  The Bohemian Grove is still ongoing right now.
[01:15:04.777 --> 01:15:11.723]  They meet every year from July 15th to July 30th and engage in these bizarre Canaanite rituals.
[01:15:12.664 --> 01:15:16.868]  And in the film and on the radio, I have always said that it looked like an effigy
[01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:23.597]  ...of a child, a five-year-old, a four-year-old, and they bring it up and burn it.
[01:15:24.777 --> 01:15:43.846]  And then in their own club publications, they show owls stomping on bloody children, you know, drawings of it, baby skeletons burning in fires, you know, owls standing on top, skulls, skulls, you know, big images of skulls up in the trees...
[01:15:45.878 --> 01:15:47.859]  I mean, I never said they were killing someone.
[01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:53.204]  And yes, I know the Press Democrat has said that I said that before.
[01:15:53.224 --> 01:15:55.706]  And I called up and complained to him.
[01:15:55.786 --> 01:15:57.247]  This was about two years ago.
[01:15:58.208 --> 01:16:02.171]  I don't have time anymore to just even complain, to even try to counter people attacking me.
[01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:04.012]  And they just didn't retract it.
[01:16:04.733 --> 01:16:05.974]  They just said, well, that's what we're saying.
[01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:08.236]  So shoot me, basically.
[01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:09.376]  So write a letter to the editor.
[01:16:10.157 --> 01:16:11.999]  But I can't really comment on this latest one because...
[01:16:15.564 --> 01:16:16.685]  In fact, I haven't read it.
[01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:21.047]  Let's go ahead and go to Ted.
[01:16:22.228 --> 01:16:23.869]  And Ted is in New York.
[01:16:23.909 --> 01:16:24.530]  Go ahead, Ted.
[01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:25.630]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.891]  You're doing a great job.
[01:16:26.911 --> 01:16:27.451]  Well, thank you.
[01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:28.792]  You don't need to tell me I'm doing a great job.
[01:16:28.812 --> 01:16:29.052]  Go ahead.
[01:16:29.132 --> 01:16:30.493]  Okay, then you're not doing a great job.
[01:16:30.513 --> 01:16:31.554]  I'm doing a horrible job.
[01:16:31.594 --> 01:16:34.736]  No, it just makes me feel weird, everybody telling me how great I am.
[01:16:35.376 --> 01:16:40.119]  You guys are great for caring about the country, for being involved enough to be listeners of this show.
[01:16:40.399 --> 01:16:42.020]  I have something interesting to tell you.
[01:16:43.261 --> 01:16:45.102]  InternetTrafficReport.com.
[01:16:45.615 --> 01:16:49.518]  The Asia routers, a lot of them are down.
[01:16:50.119 --> 01:16:51.420]  Bangalore is at zero.
[01:16:53.121 --> 01:16:58.966]  Tehran, Haifa, Tel Aviv, Japan, Malaysia, Samoa, those routers are at zero.
[01:16:59.847 --> 01:17:01.648]  One of the Taiwan routers is at zero.
[01:17:04.191 --> 01:17:05.412]  That's very unusual.
[01:17:05.772 --> 01:17:06.693]  It's extremely unusual.
[01:17:06.713 --> 01:17:08.835]  Do you think those meters may be malfunctioning?
[01:17:09.195 --> 01:17:10.816]  No, I don't think so.
[01:17:11.777 --> 01:17:12.478]  This is a world...
[01:17:13.737 --> 01:17:14.199]  Report.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.470]  So they're just at the DNS servers aren't working then.
[01:17:18.038 --> 01:17:25.344]  Yeah, or maybe somebody's busy tapping into these things, and we're seeing the results of the tapping going on.
[01:17:25.664 --> 01:17:29.888]  Well, for those that don't know, people say they can't shut the web off.
[01:17:30.008 --> 01:17:30.749]  Yes, they can.
[01:17:30.809 --> 01:17:32.090]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:40.677]  And they've said with InternetTube that they're going to shut down the old web, basically take it off live support, not update the file name servers.
[01:17:40.717 --> 01:17:41.317]  This is public.
[01:17:41.517 --> 01:17:43.219]  Just type in, the Internet is dead.
[01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:46.882]  You'll get headlines out of England where they had an InternetTube meeting.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:18:07.229]  And they're just going to start shutting down the old web, and then on the new web, it's going to be taxed, it's going to be regulated, there'll be like 50 corporations or private companies or universities you go to to have a subdomain with them, and basically it's a private group hijacking the entire web and forcing it over to their companies.
[01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:10.451]  Well, we'll just have to go right back to dial-up service, won't we?
[01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:12.517]  Well, that's it.
[01:18:12.578 --> 01:18:14.299]  I mean, they'll be like the BBSs.
[01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:17.121]  I mean, they can't stop it.
[01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:21.824]  There's now a hunger there, and people are going to find it, but they're sure going to try.
[01:18:21.844 --> 01:18:27.267]  In fact, you know what will probably happen is it will spring up new internets, new private networks.
[01:18:27.287 --> 01:18:27.788]  No, that's it.
[01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:28.888]  That's already happening.
[01:18:29.129 --> 01:18:29.389]  Yeah.
[01:18:29.509 --> 01:18:36.213]  And that's all Internet 2 is, but it's got government backing, so they're building Internet 2 with DARPA and the universities openly.
[01:18:36.574 --> 01:18:36.954]  Stay there.
[01:18:36.974 --> 01:18:37.874]  We need to talk about this.
[01:18:38.595 --> 01:18:41.617]  For those that don't know, they're openly going to steal the Internet,
[01:18:42.308 --> 01:18:46.715]  Shut it down and then transfer it over to their new thing that they're going to control.
[01:18:47.897 --> 01:18:51.823]  Galactic-sized theft worth over a trillion dollars.
[01:18:53.348 --> 01:18:57.452]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:56.770]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:20:57.070 --> 01:21:00.610]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:03.251]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial strategists

[01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:21.522]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.746 --> 01:21:56.568]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:21:56.668 --> 01:22:01.752]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:22:01.972 --> 01:22:08.137]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:14.082]  That's why a Garicus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:22:14.322 --> 01:22:19.806]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and a Garicus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:22:20.066 --> 01:22:20.567]  We're good to go.

[01:22:37.808 --> 01:22:39.089]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:08.024]  Alright, Chad in New York.
[01:23:08.064 --> 01:23:21.356]  You know, the subject you bring up about the internet is so important, and I am one of the few people that noticed this, and I'm not tooting my horn, but I've talked about it a little bit, but I haven't covered it like I should.
[01:23:21.376 --> 01:23:27.242]  They had an Internet 2 meeting earlier this year in Austin.
[01:23:28.943 --> 01:23:31.626]  And just type in, the internet is dead.
[01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:43.934]  And you'll get a whole bunch of articles out of Austin, out of London, out of the major cities in Ireland for some reason, where they've had Internet 2 meetings in the last two or three years.
[01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:46.855]  And they've got these talking points.
[01:23:47.635 --> 01:23:48.735]  The Internet is dead.
[01:23:48.796 --> 01:23:50.076]  It's over for the Internet.
[01:23:50.676 --> 01:23:52.156]  It just fell apart.
[01:23:52.477 --> 01:23:54.117]  But don't worry, the new thing is here.
[01:23:54.157 --> 01:23:58.578]  It's like claiming the new cell phone service is here, and then it doesn't work.
[01:23:58.718 --> 01:24:00.719]  Well, in this case it's going to work,
[01:24:01.385 --> 01:24:06.048]  But they're going to con you into moving over to Internet 2, and folks, you're not going to have a choice.
[01:24:06.109 --> 01:24:08.310]  They are saying, and the U.S.
[01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:21.140]  has almost all these file name servers, and is in control of it via ICANN, this quasi-private group that DARPA gave the Internet to a few decades ago, they are just saying they're not going to update it.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.242]  Any comments on that there, Ted?
[01:24:24.969 --> 01:24:25.609]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:24:25.829 --> 01:24:29.290]  And people don't understand who it is that started the Internet to begin with.
[01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:38.032]  I've talked to people, and they flat out refuse to accept the fact it was an NSA creation and a waiter used by DARPA everywhere.
[01:24:38.052 --> 01:24:45.094]  Well, they either tell you that it's Al Gore or that Bill Gates invented it.
[01:24:45.174 --> 01:24:46.034]  No, I mean, that's what I've heard.
[01:24:46.889 --> 01:24:49.891]  At one time, I had a question and answer at a speech, and I asked that question.
[01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:51.372]  I said, who invented the Internet?
[01:24:51.412 --> 01:24:52.753]  I got Al Gore and Bill Gates.
[01:24:53.514 --> 01:24:56.756]  And this was a crowd, and finally somebody said, DARPA!
[01:24:57.377 --> 01:24:57.997]  But you're right.
[01:24:58.057 --> 01:25:04.282]  DARPA did not invent... They helped manage it and helped develop it and fund it, but it was an NSA creation.
[01:25:05.163 --> 01:25:07.224]  That's National Security Agency, folks.
[01:25:08.085 --> 01:25:10.507]  And, well, do you want to comment on that, Ted?
[01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:13.229]  Yeah, or no such agency as they used to call themselves.
[01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:13.589]  Yes.
[01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.870]  Right now, the...
[01:25:16.704 --> 01:25:18.064]  I had a little more data to earlier.
[01:25:18.704 --> 01:25:22.945]  The global index of uptime right now is 75%.
[01:25:23.766 --> 01:25:24.526]  Asia is at 28%.
[01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:29.867]  It's interesting that India would be at zero right now and some of these other countries.
[01:25:31.087 --> 01:25:34.008]  Maybe it's a rehearsal or something big.
[01:25:34.068 --> 01:25:34.648]  Excuse me.
[01:25:34.988 --> 01:25:36.308]  India is at zero?
[01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:36.688]  Yes.
[01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:38.169]  It's at zero.
[01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:39.049]  I just refreshed it.
[01:25:39.915 --> 01:25:46.359]  You can go to internettrafficreport.com slash asia.htm, and you can see what I'm seeing.
[01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:48.380]  I've never heard of that happening.
[01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:56.946]  Yeah, and... I mean, we'll have times when parts of the Internet, you know, has a stroke, but not the whole thing.
[01:25:57.646 --> 01:26:00.868]  And, you know, one Taiwan router's at zero, the other one's at 81%.
[01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:09.334]  Samoa's at zero, Malaysia's at zero, Japan is at zero, and in Israel, Haifa and Tel Aviv are at zero.
[01:26:10.576 --> 01:26:13.738]  And, you know, as well, like I said, about India.
[01:26:14.099 --> 01:26:20.463]  Well, no, I mean, I've been to that Internet traffic report, and I know they... Man, I tell you, so what does this mean?
[01:26:21.464 --> 01:26:22.605]  Well, you know what it might be?
[01:26:23.005 --> 01:26:32.812]  This may be a test, because, you know, I think before they hit countries like Iran and others, I think you'll see them take the web down, you know, to stop communications.
[01:26:32.912 --> 01:26:36.475]  Oh, yeah, and then claim hackers did it, and they'll grab some zit-faced kid.
[01:26:37.256 --> 01:26:40.878]  Yeah, and they'll probably unload six or seven or nine shots into him.
[01:26:43.599 --> 01:26:49.182]  By the way, I just wanted to share something with you in the audience from Herman Goering.
[01:26:50.102 --> 01:26:52.443]  This is so apropos to what's happening today.
[01:26:52.483 --> 01:26:55.144]  He says, Why, of course, the people don't want war.
[01:26:55.505 --> 01:27:02.508]  Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?
[01:27:03.126 --> 01:27:08.047]  Naturally, the common people don't want war, neither in Russia nor in England nor, for that matter, in Germany.
[01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:09.747]  That is understood.
[01:27:10.047 --> 01:27:22.330]  But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.
[01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:27.931]  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
[01:27:28.591 --> 01:27:29.351]  That is easy.
[01:27:29.771 --> 01:27:32.192]  All you have to do is to tell them that they are being attacked.
[01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:44.540]  Yeah, there's lots of quotes like that.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:50.322]  And the incredible thing is these guys would write news articles and say it, and write books and admit it all.
[01:27:51.643 --> 01:27:53.184]  Just incredible.
[01:27:53.244 --> 01:27:54.925]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:27:55.025 --> 01:27:55.725]  You're quite welcome.
[01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:57.746]  Yeah, folks...
[01:27:59.432 --> 01:27:59.892]  It's a catch-22.
[01:27:59.932 --> 01:28:07.314]  The globalists mean for the Internet to be a total tracking grid for your refrigerator, and we're talking this in a few years.
[01:28:07.954 --> 01:28:10.415]  Your appliances will automatically reorder food.
[01:28:10.835 --> 01:28:14.176]  There'll be an RFID chip that costs about two cents on every item.
[01:28:14.636 --> 01:28:15.977]  It will read and track that.
[01:28:17.937 --> 01:28:19.798]  England's already talking about doing it with the trash cans.
[01:28:21.258 --> 01:28:27.280]  And everything you do will be tracked, traced, and taxed, and it gives them total control.
[01:28:28.297 --> 01:28:38.128]  And then they're just going to shut the old web off, the template, basically burn that, and then force you onto the new one where there's no freedom.
[01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:42.212]  It's called Internet 2, and it is the kiss of death.
[01:28:43.474 --> 01:28:44.415]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.875 --> 01:28:46.497]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.398 --> 01:28:50.081]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:54.884]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:28:55.085 --> 01:28:57.106]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.

[01:29:58.714 --> 01:30:00.956]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[01:30:01.016 --> 01:30:04.159]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:08.484]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:30:08.824 --> 01:30:11.847]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.167 --> 01:30:15.591]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:25.274]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.514 --> 01:30:29.015]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:30:54.674 --> 01:31:01.536]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:01.776 --> 01:31:04.157]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:06.357]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:12.059]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:12.439 --> 01:31:16.724]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:17.185 --> 01:31:25.074]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with this 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:25.274 --> 01:31:30.320]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.363]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:32.843 --> 01:31:36.005]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:31:36.225 --> 01:31:38.707]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:31:38.927 --> 01:31:40.308]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:31:40.508 --> 01:31:45.270]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:31:45.511 --> 01:31:47.852]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:31:47.972 --> 01:31:48.452]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:31:59.578 --> 01:32:04.782]  You know, the world is so complex that I don't claim to know much of anything.
[01:32:26.767 --> 01:32:41.334]  But compared to the average person out there who doesn't even try to investigate the way things work and how the world operates, compared to them, our listeners, myself included, are light years ahead of people.
[01:32:41.695 --> 01:32:56.122]  If the average American knew about government-sponsored terror, if the average American knew about our birthright and our history and what was in the Bill of Rights, they would look around them and see the horrific tyranny being instigated against us.
[01:32:58.542 --> 01:33:11.768]  But at the same time, that last caller brings up how the Internet works, and these key switching stations and servers and routers, how just a handful of systems control everything.
[01:33:13.068 --> 01:33:22.252]  And those are at universities, those are at select corporations, the government controls those through ICANN, and they can shut it down any time they want.
[01:33:24.716 --> 01:33:27.337]  And they're openly saying that they're not going to update them.
[01:33:27.438 --> 01:33:32.720]  They're going to let it start failing as more and more people around the world try to log onto the Internet.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.642]  They said it's going to fail in the next three years.
[01:33:35.742 --> 01:33:37.623]  And they started saying this a year ago.
[01:33:39.024 --> 01:33:50.110]  And these are private corporations teamed up with the government and universities saying they're going to set the rules of the new Internet and they're going to force you all over onto it.
[01:33:51.852 --> 01:33:54.254]  And so they're going to create an artificial monopoly.
[01:33:54.294 --> 01:33:59.358]  They're going to create a syndicate, just like the big newspapers were bought up 100 years ago.
[01:34:00.179 --> 01:34:03.261]  Before that, you had thousands of owners of newspapers.
[01:34:04.282 --> 01:34:11.708]  Now, what is it, like 93% of the entire newspaper readership market is owned by five companies?
[01:34:12.918 --> 01:34:17.340]  And then the other little 7% is just the thousands of little local papers.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.461]  But still, that 7% is big.
[01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:22.082]  Why not start your own local paper?
[01:34:22.342 --> 01:34:24.203]  We may have to go back to that at some point.
[01:34:27.845 --> 01:34:28.525]  It's scary.
[01:34:28.805 --> 01:34:30.366]  I mean, it's really, really scary.
[01:34:30.566 --> 01:34:35.768]  And there's many different ways they plan to control the net.
[01:34:36.188 --> 01:34:39.590]  Number one is, I would have to say, is Internet, too.
[01:34:40.874 --> 01:34:47.457]  But in the interim, they're coming out with hate crimes laws, saying, we want America to sign treaties where we can arrest U.S.
[01:34:47.497 --> 01:34:53.340]  citizens if they say, you know, anything that the EU disagrees with, basically.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:59.222]  And our federal government's trying to pass laws to arrest you for your speech.
[01:35:01.103 --> 01:35:02.704]  And I know a lot of you are doubting that.
[01:35:03.584 --> 01:35:06.905]  I had trouble believing it years ago, even when I read the legislation.
[01:35:06.965 --> 01:35:07.906]  It's failed many times.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:10.980]  And they change the name every year.
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.421]  This year it's called the Local Law Enforcement Assistance Act.
[01:35:14.901 --> 01:35:15.801]  Nothing to do with that.
[01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:23.263]  It should be called the Federalization of Local Police into Commissariat Political Thought Crimes Thugs.
[01:35:25.463 --> 01:35:29.044]  But I've read the bills.
[01:35:29.504 --> 01:35:30.405]  And it's in there right now.
[01:35:30.425 --> 01:35:32.145]  And it barely failed last year.
[01:35:32.185 --> 01:35:33.825]  They're trying to ram it through this year.
[01:35:34.105 --> 01:35:36.786]  And folks, you read from the Old Testament.
[01:35:37.475 --> 01:35:40.476]  You're arrested, criticizing certain groups.
[01:35:41.536 --> 01:35:42.776]  States have passed these laws.
[01:35:42.836 --> 01:35:47.097]  Remember what happened in Philadelphia, where they passed a law the year before.
[01:35:47.177 --> 01:35:48.857]  We talked about that law, and look what happened.
[01:35:49.437 --> 01:35:51.357]  Thank God the Christians had video of it.
[01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:52.898]  We've linked to the video on the website.
[01:35:53.618 --> 01:35:55.718]  They have the OutFest, the gay parade.
[01:35:57.659 --> 01:36:05.320]  And the folks at the OutFest didn't believe in the First Amendment, and so here were these peaceful people in an open city area down at the park,
[01:36:06.019 --> 01:36:07.981]  And here were these Christians across the street.
[01:36:08.001 --> 01:36:13.605]  The cops had said, you can't be in this public park during the outfest.
[01:36:14.526 --> 01:36:14.887]  Okay?
[01:36:17.789 --> 01:36:18.890]  You're just not allowed to come in here.
[01:36:20.211 --> 01:36:21.592]  But you can stand across the street.
[01:36:21.612 --> 01:36:22.773]  So they're standing across the street.
[01:36:23.654 --> 01:36:24.795]  Already got their rights violated.
[01:36:24.835 --> 01:36:25.555]  Just praying.
[01:36:26.096 --> 01:36:26.576]  Quietly.
[01:36:27.777 --> 01:36:29.198]  And here come the cops.
[01:36:29.218 --> 01:36:30.680]  You've got to move to a free speech zone.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.121]  So they take them down a side alley.
[01:36:32.702 --> 01:36:34.163]  They notice there's the paddy wagons.
[01:36:34.824 --> 01:36:36.085]  That's what they do all over the country.
[01:36:36.385 --> 01:36:57.742]  Whether you're an environmental activist or a Second Amendment activist or a land rights activist or an anti-gay activist, whatever you are, they herd you towards, just comply please, we're not arresting you, they herd you towards the paddy wagon, and then at the paddy wagon, about 20 of the outfest people, just talk about Nazis, run over, start screaming and yelling, and the cops go, See?
[01:36:57.762 --> 01:36:57.822]  See?
[01:36:59.264 --> 01:36:59.484]  See?
[01:37:01.235 --> 01:37:02.756]  You have incited them.
[01:37:03.296 --> 01:37:04.157]  It's your fault.
[01:37:04.257 --> 01:37:04.817]  They're yelling.
[01:37:05.397 --> 01:37:07.578]  So we're charging you all with terrorism.
[01:37:08.779 --> 01:37:11.820]  And they faced 47 years in prison.
[01:37:13.001 --> 01:37:14.522]  Over 20 people were arrested.
[01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:17.563]  They knocked the charges down to like six or seven people.
[01:37:17.823 --> 01:37:18.083]  47 years.
[01:37:18.163 --> 01:37:19.344]  And Bush's U.S.
[01:37:19.384 --> 01:37:20.825]  attorney was helping with the charges.
[01:37:20.865 --> 01:37:21.825]  And it was going forward.
[01:37:21.865 --> 01:37:27.048]  And a judge, they appealed the motion for trial to a higher judge.
[01:37:27.068 --> 01:37:28.088]  And the judge said, no way.
[01:37:28.329 --> 01:37:29.149]  This is America.
[01:37:30.174 --> 01:37:32.414]  But, see, not all judges are like that, folks.
[01:37:34.635 --> 01:37:37.615]  And Alberto Gonzalez believes in arresting people for their speech.
[01:37:38.135 --> 01:37:49.958]  He advised the court on briefs where anti-war protesters, you'd have in one case, you know, 500 pro-Bush people, one person with a no blood for oil sign, in a non-permanent demonstration worshipping the leader when he came to his hotel.
[01:37:49.978 --> 01:37:52.798]  You know, they're all two blocks down being held back by the police.
[01:37:53.298 --> 01:37:56.319]  One guy has a sign, the cops go, Secret Service says you're not allowed to protest.
[01:37:56.759 --> 01:37:58.239]  And the guy said, yeah, I'm an American.
[01:37:58.857 --> 01:38:01.239]  He was a Vietnam veteran in that particular case I'm covering.
[01:38:01.819 --> 01:38:04.622]  And they arrested him and he spent six months in federal prison.
[01:38:06.323 --> 01:38:08.345]  Oh yeah, the federal judge said, yeah, we're allowed to do this.
[01:38:10.447 --> 01:38:11.487]  I'm sure you heard the story.
[01:38:12.008 --> 01:38:14.750]  We had the owner of the coffee shop and donut shop on.
[01:38:16.131 --> 01:38:21.215]  Bush was going to be coming last year to Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:38:21.816 --> 01:38:25.119]  And so all the stores got calls saying no anti-Bush signs.
[01:38:25.159 --> 01:38:27.220]  No Bush signs, period, in your windows.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:27.821]  Do you understand?
[01:38:28.516 --> 01:38:29.577]  This is the Secret Service.
[01:38:30.597 --> 01:38:32.118]  The guy said, well, I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[01:38:32.419 --> 01:38:33.799]  I'm pretty conservative.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.362]  My main clientele is the federal courthouse next door, but that's it.
[01:38:37.762 --> 01:38:43.466]  I'm putting a sign up saying I was told by the Secret Service not to have a sign up, and I've got a free speech right to do this.
[01:38:44.266 --> 01:38:50.190]  I mean, if they try to intimidate us and tell us just to shut up, and we go along with it, then it's over, folks.
[01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:51.711]  This country's gone.
[01:38:53.072 --> 01:38:53.892]  You understand that?
[01:38:54.413 --> 01:38:56.214]  Your children's birthright is gone.
[01:38:57.017 --> 01:38:58.758]  Your grandchildren's birthright is gone.
[01:38:59.178 --> 01:39:01.260]  You're not going to have to wait for them to be hurt by this.
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.240]  Maybe you don't care about them.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.021]  You're so self-centered.
[01:39:03.521 --> 01:39:05.022]  Folks, they're going to take your pension funds.
[01:39:05.942 --> 01:39:08.124]  They're going to take your jobs economically.
[01:39:08.444 --> 01:39:11.766]  The globalists openly have some really bad things planned for this country.
[01:39:12.426 --> 01:39:21.011]  They openly talk about bringing us down to third world status, teaching us a lesson, sustainability, Agenda 21, NAFTA, GATT.
[01:39:21.051 --> 01:39:23.653]  It's all the same agenda through these trees.
[01:39:27.064 --> 01:39:31.287]  And, you know, it just makes my head spin sometimes.
[01:39:32.468 --> 01:39:34.709]  Heaven help this country!
[01:39:37.551 --> 01:39:37.911]  All right.
[01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:44.636]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:39:45.176 --> 01:39:48.618]  You know what, let me just cover a little bit of news quickly, and then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:39:49.118 --> 01:39:50.319]  The calls are the news.
[01:39:50.399 --> 01:39:51.860]  All the different items you bring up.
[01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:56.043]  Frankly, it's better than covering the news because you always bring up the news.
[01:39:56.935 --> 01:40:02.338]  In fact, you almost always bring up something in my stack that I never would have gotten to if we wouldn't have taken your call.
[01:40:02.758 --> 01:40:05.620]  Georgia claims Russia behind February bombing.
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:07.241]  This is the Moscow News.
[01:40:08.441 --> 01:40:09.622]  Big daily paper of Moscow.
[01:40:10.122 --> 01:40:13.144]  And, of course, we have a link to the archive, the Galean Dialectic and History.
[01:40:13.544 --> 01:40:15.806]  Russian FSB caught blowing up buildings.
[01:40:16.686 --> 01:40:18.087]  Georgia's Interior Minister...
[01:40:19.235 --> 01:40:34.318]  Vano Merboshvil accused the Russian military Monday of being behind a series of attacks, including a powerful car bomb attack that killed three policemen in the eastern Georgia city of Gori in February.
[01:40:35.978 --> 01:40:45.400]  The inquiry into the Gori attack revealed that Russian Colonel Anatoly Sivyov... I'm sorry to the Slavs, I barely speak English.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:46.180]  I'm a redneck, but...
[01:40:46.852 --> 01:40:47.372]  Having trouble.
[01:40:47.972 --> 01:40:49.052]  Saisoyev.
[01:40:49.273 --> 01:40:49.813]  Saisoyev!
[01:40:49.853 --> 01:40:50.373]  There we go!
[01:40:50.953 --> 01:40:51.513]  Saisoyev!
[01:40:53.093 --> 01:40:58.354]  Organized a group of saboteurs who were trained on Russian territory.
[01:40:58.915 --> 01:41:03.255]  The group was responsible for several terrorist attacks and organized the attack in Gory.
[01:41:04.756 --> 01:41:15.358]  He said in televised remarks that were immediately denied by Russia's embassy in Tbilisi and officials in Moscow.
[01:41:17.754 --> 01:41:30.662]  Three people have so far been arrested in the investigation, and six more are wanted, he said, adding that the results of the inquiry have been passed to the Russian embassy, which, he said, would be studied.
[01:41:30.802 --> 01:41:38.247]  I hope the Russians' side will hand over all suspects that organized and carried out these terrorist attacks on Georgian territory, he said.
[01:41:38.847 --> 01:41:43.170]  And, of course, those attacks were carried out clearly by the Russians and then blamed on their political enemies.
[01:41:43.650 --> 01:41:46.672]  Folks, Putin was caught, FSB members, three of them,
[01:41:47.185 --> 01:41:49.025]  Planting bombs in a fourth building.
[01:41:50.526 --> 01:41:50.626]  In 99.
[01:41:52.266 --> 01:41:53.806]  He was wildly unpopular.
[01:41:53.886 --> 01:41:58.027]  The people hated him, knew he was a czarist, slash commissariat.
[01:41:59.588 --> 01:42:02.708]  And by czarist, that's incorrect, folks.
[01:42:03.849 --> 01:42:06.389]  A Soviet imperialist.
[01:42:06.789 --> 01:42:08.170]  Czarist would be the opposite of that.
[01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:12.270]  At least on the command and control spectrum, on the opposite of that.
[01:42:13.051 --> 01:42:14.931]  But he got caught...
[01:42:15.956 --> 01:42:18.197]  And Moscow police, by and large, aren't bad.
[01:42:18.217 --> 01:42:18.877]  They're good people.
[01:42:18.957 --> 01:42:23.900]  And they were staking out apartments and caught the guys planting the bombs.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:24.940]  And it was real bombs.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:25.780]  And what did Putin say?
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:26.841]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[01:42:28.202 --> 01:42:30.643]  And then when police chiefs wouldn't shut up, he got them fired.
[01:42:31.863 --> 01:42:34.784]  Now here in America, most police chiefs would just care about their jet boat.
[01:42:34.824 --> 01:42:37.146]  And so what if Bush is blowing stuff up?
[01:42:37.206 --> 01:42:37.946]  I'll go along.
[01:42:39.126 --> 01:42:40.407]  And that's how evil we've gotten.
[01:42:40.447 --> 01:42:42.488]  But over in Russia, it didn't quite work that way.
[01:42:44.664 --> 01:42:54.853]  The Russian colonel traveled frequently to Moscow-backed separatist region of South Ossetia and invited... ...Valevieve to join the military intelligence.
[01:42:54.873 --> 01:42:55.534]  And then it goes on.
[01:42:56.915 --> 01:42:57.976]  With all the evidence of that.
[01:42:58.096 --> 01:43:11.888]  And do not forget, our government admits, they brag about it, that pro-America Mosaddegh wouldn't give BP all the oil in 1953 in Iran, so they carried out bombings and shootings all over the country,
[01:43:12.634 --> 01:43:19.239]  And then handed out handbills saying, up with Mosaddegh, up with communism, up with the bombings, and then our government removed him.
[01:43:20.259 --> 01:43:27.404]  Our government gets on the radio and gets on TV and puts it in books and brags, oh yeah, we carry out terror and blame it on people.
[01:43:28.305 --> 01:43:30.586]  We have their own handbooks from the 70s, the 80s.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:36.842]  We have Operation Northwood, where the government goes, we could hijack jets and crash them and bomb D.C.
[01:43:36.882 --> 01:43:42.284]  and commit sniper attacks and train patsies, and we could blow up a ship again in Havana Harbor like we did in 1898.
[01:43:43.404 --> 01:43:44.565]  We could do it again!
[01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:48.726]  Folks, this is not a radical broadcast.
[01:43:48.746 --> 01:43:51.607]  We're just telling it like it is.
[01:43:52.888 --> 01:43:53.828]  Who has the history?
[01:43:54.108 --> 01:43:54.909]  Who has the motive?
[01:43:54.929 --> 01:43:59.090]  And every day, there's some new example of governments carrying out bombings.
[01:43:59.370 --> 01:44:00.751]  You know, let's say you're against...
[01:44:03.194 --> 01:44:08.063]  Taking implantable microchips ten years from now when you basically can't leave your house unless you have one.
[01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:10.207]  If they win, folks, you'll see.
[01:44:10.247 --> 01:44:10.568]  It'll happen.
[01:44:12.592 --> 01:44:15.898]  And they'll probably still even let me be on the air complaining about it because you'll have to do it.
[01:44:17.205 --> 01:44:20.386]  I'll have to have food deliveries made to my house or I can't go out or the police will arrest me.
[01:44:20.626 --> 01:44:21.966]  I mean, I'm not being sarcastic, folks.
[01:44:22.186 --> 01:44:26.788]  Who would have thought the Supreme Court would say forced drugging, forced psychological testing of all school children?
[01:44:26.808 --> 01:44:28.788]  Who would have thought they'd say no private property?
[01:44:28.988 --> 01:44:33.790]  Who would have thought that Tommy Thompson would have taken a chip and traveled the country telling children to take it?
[01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:36.050]  I mean, the former secretary.
[01:44:37.711 --> 01:44:39.111]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone.
[01:44:39.632 --> 01:44:44.433]  Hypothetically, would a Christian group carry out bombings...
[01:44:46.594 --> 01:44:47.894]  Against the microchip.
[01:44:47.954 --> 01:44:52.796]  That would only make the government's case be stronger and help their position of trying to microchip us.
[01:44:55.477 --> 01:44:57.217]  Let's use a real world example.
[01:44:57.237 --> 01:45:00.719]  9-11.
[01:45:00.819 --> 01:45:02.279]  Why on earth would the Saudis?
[01:45:02.339 --> 01:45:04.700]  Why on earth would the Afghans?
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.440]  Why on earth would the Egyptians?
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.541]  Why on earth would Ayatollah Khomeini?
[01:45:11.002 --> 01:45:14.943]  Why would any of these people throughout history
[01:45:16.351 --> 01:45:20.992]  Going back 20 years, why would Gaddafi want to care?
[01:45:21.032 --> 01:45:23.573]  And Lockerbie's been proven to be a British government job, folks.
[01:45:24.674 --> 01:45:26.614]  Why would this happen?
[01:45:27.514 --> 01:45:31.015]  Why would they want to attack America knowing?
[01:45:32.456 --> 01:45:42.419]  I mean, that'd be like if I weighed 110 pounds and was the biggest, you know, couldn't wrestle my way out of a paper bag.
[01:45:44.543 --> 01:45:52.687]  And I wanted to go pick a fight with some 6'8", 300-pound powerlifter named Crusher who's killed three people.
[01:45:55.108 --> 01:45:56.049]  Or here's a better analogy.
[01:45:56.249 --> 01:46:02.392]  If I was a 100-pound person in a wheelchair, why would I go into a biker bar and start swinging a golf club at bikers?
[01:46:04.052 --> 01:46:05.333]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:46:06.013 --> 01:46:11.536]  Just on its face, folks, it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.
[01:46:12.637 --> 01:46:13.637]  It's asinine.
[01:46:17.449 --> 01:46:19.750]  And again, you go, well, there have been lots of bombings throughout history.
[01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:20.390]  Yeah.
[01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:31.774]  The CIA went in to the Muslim radicals, literal people living as Bedouins, living in little cities, literal cavemen.
[01:46:32.375 --> 01:46:35.476]  They went to them in the 1950s and said, Communists are trying to take over.
[01:46:36.336 --> 01:46:43.999]  And they went and radicalized the Muslims, saying the Russians won't let you practice your religion, which was true, by the way.
[01:46:45.052 --> 01:46:49.395]  And you've got to get dirty and start bombing them, and we're going to let you take over the government.
[01:46:51.416 --> 01:46:52.596]  All over the Middle East.
[01:46:55.038 --> 01:46:56.699]  And then they call that blowback today.
[01:46:56.759 --> 01:46:57.899]  It's not blowback.
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:05.544]  You know, a lot of these suicide bombers and people that are carrying out are just poor guys from some little dust village.
[01:47:06.144 --> 01:47:07.565]  They've never been outside his village.
[01:47:08.045 --> 01:47:09.206]  He's 18 years old.
[01:47:09.286 --> 01:47:10.126]  Mama gets, you know, $100,000. $100,000?
[01:47:12.839 --> 01:47:16.081]  And he goes and blows himself up, and he's a real suicide bomber.
[01:47:16.762 --> 01:47:23.286]  But what you don't know is that that money came directly from the IMF and World Bank, and we've been able to track it from there.
[01:47:23.626 --> 01:47:30.010]  And Barry Hamish, a renowned Jewish reporter, even writes for the Jerusalem Post, has exposed that stuff.
[01:47:30.871 --> 01:47:32.892]  They want to keep that area militarized.
[01:47:34.269 --> 01:47:36.550]  So they're real Muslim terrorists, too, folks.
[01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:46.113]  But up the chain, they're being funded and controlled and were founded by Mossad, Shin Bet, MI5, MI6, CIA, Defense Intelligence.
[01:47:46.133 --> 01:47:46.853]  This is admitted.
[01:47:48.033 --> 01:47:50.094]  Yishak Rabin gave a speech and admitted it.
[01:47:50.114 --> 01:47:53.495]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:47:53.615 --> 01:47:54.375]  I read the newspaper.
[01:47:55.776 --> 01:47:56.676]  I read the news wires.
[01:47:56.776 --> 01:47:58.536]  I read what these people, the speeches they give.
[01:47:58.636 --> 01:48:01.057]  I watch the video of their speeches online.
[01:48:01.337 --> 01:48:03.258]  I sit up until 4 in the morning researching this.
[01:48:05.467 --> 01:48:09.611]  And until we figure out who's behind the terror and who stands to gain from it, it just don't get worse.
[01:48:13.294 --> 01:48:14.775]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:48:14.815 --> 01:48:15.455]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:48:15.936 --> 01:48:16.456]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:48:16.476 --> 01:48:17.017]  How are you doing?
[01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:17.497]  Good.
[01:48:18.178 --> 01:48:22.281]  I was just sitting here going over my terrorist documents, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:48:22.942 --> 01:48:26.024]  Which they do teach in FBI manuals are terrorists.
[01:48:26.064 --> 01:48:26.985]  Project Megiddo, right?
[01:48:27.702 --> 01:48:28.723]  Well, that's part of it.
[01:48:28.743 --> 01:48:34.847]  You know, I also have the footage in Kansas City of the FEMA commander, military guy, teaching the police there.
[01:48:35.207 --> 01:48:44.293]  I also think I'm going to spend the rest of my afternoon, like, injecting myself with microchips, munching on some depleted uranium, and I'll wash it all down with some delicious and nutritious mercury.
[01:48:46.034 --> 01:48:48.716]  Again, it sounds insane, but that's what they say is good, yeah.
[01:48:49.236 --> 01:48:51.798]  I wanted to seriously, though, ask you a couple questions about...
[01:48:54.079 --> 01:48:59.001]  And how does that correlate with TMAP, the Texas Medical Algorithm Project?
[01:48:59.341 --> 01:49:00.202]  It's the same thing.
[01:49:00.362 --> 01:49:01.362]  The same thing, really?
[01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:09.385]  Yeah, federally funded drug testing, getting you used to like a prisoner, giving, you know, tests to see if you're on drugs in the criminal justice system.
[01:49:09.645 --> 01:49:11.745]  Then you statistically get on more drugs, not less.
[01:49:11.825 --> 01:49:12.306]  They know that.
[01:49:12.566 --> 01:49:13.066]  That's the plan.
[01:49:13.086 --> 01:49:13.566]  They ship it in.
[01:49:14.762 --> 01:49:15.903]  And you've got to hand it to them.
[01:49:15.944 --> 01:49:19.648]  Back when drugs were legal, these monopolies didn't make as much money, did they?
[01:49:19.948 --> 01:49:20.369]  They did not.
[01:49:20.449 --> 01:49:23.132]  No, I mean, a whole can of opium was only like a dollar.
[01:49:23.852 --> 01:49:30.360]  One of the concerns that I would have for parents, because I know they're setting it up right next door here in Illinois right now, or close to us.
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.562]  Yeah, Team Screen is just the local name of the...
[01:49:34.958 --> 01:49:35.599]  New freedoms.
[01:49:35.799 --> 01:49:36.901]  Are you against new freedom?
[01:49:37.401 --> 01:49:38.563]  Now, now, when?
[01:49:38.723 --> 01:49:40.325]  Tim, don't you want new freedom?
[01:49:40.626 --> 01:49:41.907]  Oh, you're going to have to ask my question.
[01:49:41.947 --> 01:49:42.848]  It's freedom plus.
[01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:43.930]  Well, I'll answer you on the other side.
[01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:44.250]  Stay there.
[01:49:44.691 --> 01:49:46.333]  Freedom plus restrictions.
[01:49:46.894 --> 01:49:48.536]  Freedom plus surveillance.
[01:49:49.237 --> 01:49:50.779]  Freedom plus enslavement.
[01:49:53.303 --> 01:50:00.145]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.445 --> 01:50:01.825]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.005 --> 01:50:04.226]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.366 --> 01:50:06.466]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.747 --> 01:50:11.668]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.008 --> 01:50:16.029]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.309 --> 01:50:16.730]  We're good to go.
[01:50:31.186 --> 01:50:34.868]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns on the InfoWars.

[01:51:09.434 --> 01:51:09.934]  We're good to go.
[01:51:35.458 --> 01:51:37.560]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:51:49.751 --> 01:51:51.032]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:51.818 --> 01:51:54.380]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.002]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:51:58.122 --> 01:51:58.502]  Shocking?
[01:51:58.602 --> 01:51:59.062]  Of course.
[01:51:59.322 --> 01:52:01.384]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:52:01.544 --> 01:52:04.446]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:52:04.646 --> 01:52:06.006]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[01:52:06.167 --> 01:52:10.429]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott's Ph.D.
[01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:12.030]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[01:52:12.330 --> 01:52:17.433]  This 150-plus page milestone gives you more for your money than any other piece of work on this subject.

[01:52:30.599 --> 01:52:38.123]  Also, you will learn about the three foods to avoid at all costs by ordering the book Secret Assassins of Food only from Mother Earth Minerals, Inc.
[01:52:38.343 --> 01:52:40.904]  for only $16.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:52:40.964 --> 01:52:43.024]  1-800-259-9231 Alright, go ahead and finish up, Tim.
[01:53:06.644 --> 01:53:07.065]  Yes, Alex.
[01:53:07.105 --> 01:53:07.986]  Thank you very much.
[01:53:08.026 --> 01:53:26.085]  My question was, I know they've come in and they've made it so the legislation will have Medicaid pick up a lot of the tab for these new psychotropics and these SSRIs that they're going to be prescribing to these children that they just subjectively picked to go on this thing.
[01:53:26.765 --> 01:53:27.346]  My question is,
[01:53:27.958 --> 01:53:29.679]  How are they going to enforce that?
[01:53:29.699 --> 01:53:31.601]  Are they going to make the kids take drug tests?
[01:53:31.681 --> 01:53:34.663]  Are they going to have the enforcement police come?
[01:53:34.763 --> 01:53:36.064]  Oh, yeah, there's going to be that, too.
[01:53:36.104 --> 01:53:37.806]  See, that's part of getting the drug testing in.
[01:53:37.866 --> 01:53:41.609]  It's not just a test to see if you're on the illegal drugs to get you into their system.
[01:53:41.889 --> 01:53:43.990]  It's also to make sure you're taking the drugs they've ordered.
[01:53:44.291 --> 01:53:45.892]  Oh, gee, wake up, people.
[01:53:46.899 --> 01:53:48.400]  Oh, listen, it's in the plan.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:54:01.824]  If it's put into your state, we just beat it in Texas, but it was federally passed, they will forcibly come to your house, even if you're homeschooled, and take your five-year-old off for psychological testing with guidelines written by the drug companies.
[01:54:01.844 --> 01:54:02.465]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:02.825 --> 01:54:04.985]  I mean, folks, you couldn't make stuff up like this.
[01:54:05.726 --> 01:54:15.189]  I mean, Tommy Thompson, the big secretary, Bush's cabinet leaves and has now taken the chip and is going to travel the country promoting that young people get chips.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.181]  Folks, it's happening!
[01:54:19.461 --> 01:54:21.843]  We're in a bad science fiction movie!
[01:54:24.465 --> 01:54:26.547]  Man, I tell you, we're in Revelations 4, man.
[01:54:27.367 --> 01:54:30.670]  But your churches will say, don't worry, just take it.
[01:54:31.210 --> 01:54:32.992]  It's not evil, it's good.
[01:54:34.353 --> 01:54:36.975]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:54:37.015 --> 01:54:38.476]  Let's talk to Fred.
[01:54:39.016 --> 01:54:39.597]  Philadelphia.
[01:54:39.637 --> 01:54:40.057]  Go ahead, Fred.
[01:54:40.497 --> 01:54:41.638]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:43.331 --> 01:54:45.352]  I wanted to bring up a couple things.
[01:54:45.432 --> 01:54:54.216]  First of all, on the investigation after the second incident in London, you had... Hey, talk right into your telephone for me.
[01:54:54.236 --> 01:54:54.857]  Huh?
[01:54:55.657 --> 01:54:57.178]  Put the telephone right up by your mouth for me.
[01:54:57.338 --> 01:54:58.619]  Okay, can you hear me better now?
[01:54:58.979 --> 01:55:01.920]  Yes, you're covering the receiver.
[01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:07.303]  The local cops had actually raided a...
[01:55:10.956 --> 01:55:17.311]  A house in Tulsa Hill and actually I had heard on the mainstream media that there was another killing on...
[01:55:20.197 --> 01:55:20.937]  On Friday.
[01:55:20.957 --> 01:55:22.618]  Yeah, there have been a whole bunch of killings.
[01:55:22.638 --> 01:55:25.999]  And people are saying they're killing people that aren't Muslims.
[01:55:26.039 --> 01:55:28.060]  They're getting rid of some evidence.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:35.503]  So you've got to have people that look like they're Central Asian or Arabic, but they don't really need to be.
[01:55:36.143 --> 01:55:37.864]  But then you've got to get rid of those people.
[01:55:37.904 --> 01:55:43.206]  Well, remember, there is a population, for example, of Cubans that are fanatically anti-Castro.
[01:55:43.226 --> 01:55:46.787]  There's a population of Christian Arabs that is fanatically...
[01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:56.751]  Yeah, there's also a pro-Israel group of Palestinians that Israel openly uses to carry out bombings and blame it on the Palestinians.
[01:55:57.091 --> 01:56:10.756]  Yeah, and the other thing I wanted to mention is on the different subject, the Internet, you had basically agencies that were developing information networking.
[01:56:10.796 --> 01:56:15.198]  At the time, the Internet was getting off the ground.
[01:56:15.258 --> 01:56:16.959]  Defense Communications Agency
[01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:18.451]  We're good to go.
[01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:18.771]  I think?
[01:56:44.155 --> 01:56:56.544]  The secret organizations have the power over the Internet, not necessarily day-to-day in detail, but to make sure that it doesn't do anything that is unapproved of by the agencies.
[01:56:58.285 --> 01:56:59.366]  Yeah, that's admitted.
[01:56:59.426 --> 01:57:00.227]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:00.287 --> 01:57:03.169]  And the average person needs to become aware of that.
[01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:04.610]  The third hour is coming up.
[01:57:06.392 --> 01:57:11.313]  30 more minutes of news and information, and we've got a special interview coming up in your calls.
[01:57:11.333 --> 01:57:11.853]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:12.073 --> 01:57:17.014]  I'll get into this ridiculous story about Bin Laden wants to poison the cocaine.
[01:57:17.494 --> 01:57:20.535]  Don't for a minute think the crime families are going to allow that.
[01:57:22.255 --> 01:57:25.976]  You think the Bushes are going to allow their best business to be tampered with?
[01:57:25.996 --> 01:57:27.036]  That's totally made up.
[01:57:27.916 --> 01:57:29.897]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:57:29.917 --> 01:57:30.317]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:37.635]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:37.655 --> 01:57:37.955]  Terrorists!
[01:57:37.995 --> 01:57:38.456]  Big Brother!
[01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:52.171]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.892 --> 01:57:53.993]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.633 --> 01:57:55.474]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:57.116]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.136 --> 01:58:01.459]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:06.124]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.445 --> 01:58:14.952]  All right, my friends, we are now into the final hour of this live Tuesday, the 26th of July, 2005 edition.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.461]  I want to get into some of the degradation of society.
[01:58:21.481 --> 01:58:24.961]  You know, I mentioned this a few days ago, but it's gotten a lot of attention.
[01:58:25.461 --> 01:58:28.602]  Grand Theft Auto re-rated for porn scene.
[01:58:28.622 --> 01:58:34.643]  And they claim they accidentally put this porn in the video game.
[01:58:34.723 --> 01:58:38.524]  Folks, they got these other games where you rape prostitutes and get the money.
[01:58:39.044 --> 01:58:40.864]  And these are marketed towards children.
[01:58:40.884 --> 01:58:43.425]  You know, you don't pay the prostitute and you get bonuses.
[01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:49.801]  It's all scientifically desensitizing.
[01:58:50.402 --> 01:58:52.603]  And believe me, they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:58:52.623 --> 01:59:00.549]  And then, oh, they accidentally put this in the video games, and then they accidentally release on a message board how to hit the right buttons to see it.
[01:59:00.869 --> 01:59:03.251]  They've always put secret stuff in video games.
[01:59:03.271 --> 01:59:05.672]  That's part of the fun of playing them.
[01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:11.797]  But now it's mainly rape and murder and killing and assassinating and, you know,
[01:59:12.825 --> 01:59:16.947]  Torturing children or killing American patriots, you know, your U.N.
[01:59:16.967 --> 01:59:17.347]  troops.
[01:59:18.968 --> 01:59:26.632]  So we'll get into that a little bit as well and some punchy police state stuff that's been going on.
[01:59:27.692 --> 01:59:31.514]  And this thing about Bin Laden wanting to poison the cocaine, it's just so stupid.
[01:59:32.054 --> 01:59:37.036]  All right, now let's go to one of our classic callers, Ron from New York.
[01:59:37.097 --> 01:59:37.937]  Ron, what's on your mind?
[01:59:38.607 --> 01:59:39.167]  Yes, Alex.
[01:59:39.528 --> 01:59:42.010]  As I said before, it just never ends in this city.
[01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:45.852]  It's blow after blow after blow, day after day, since July the 7th.
[01:59:45.872 --> 01:59:46.213]  That's right.
[01:59:46.233 --> 01:59:47.153]  We're going to search you.
[01:59:47.193 --> 01:59:48.294]  No more Fourth Amendment.
[01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:49.275]  You're our slaves.
[01:59:49.335 --> 01:59:50.075]  More cameras.
[01:59:50.336 --> 01:59:53.258]  We're going to track anybody that has diabetes in a database.
[01:59:53.538 --> 01:59:56.240]  Yes, and it's even more, Alex, in the last 24 hours.
[01:59:56.300 --> 02:00:05.707]  By the way, if anybody wants to get a taste or flavor of what the new freedom is, let them go to the website for New York Newsday, and they will see five innocent men
[02:00:06.487 --> 02:00:09.208]  Tied up, leaning forward, hands behind their back.
[02:00:09.648 --> 02:00:15.610]  It'll look like a scene from the streets of the SUNY Triangle, but I can assure you it's right here in America, in Manhattan.
[02:00:15.690 --> 02:00:16.450]  Yeah, they train you.
[02:00:16.590 --> 02:00:19.131]  You have machine guns aimed at you, everyone's put in handcuffs.
[02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:22.532]  The Germans just lined you up when they searched your bus for train.
[02:00:22.952 --> 02:00:25.413]  Now in America, you get to have knees put on your head.
[02:00:25.753 --> 02:00:34.996]  And if you want to see a picture of the new freedom in the new America, as I said, go to the website for today's New York Newsday, page A4 and A5, and they'll get a flavor for it.
[02:00:35.336 --> 02:00:36.197]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:00:36.297 --> 02:00:38.939]  Email that to Prison Planet over there.
[02:00:38.959 --> 02:00:39.660]  We'll get it posted.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.162]  Well, as I said to before, I'm low-tech.
[02:00:42.222 --> 02:00:43.903]  I could send it snail mail if you'd like.
[02:00:44.364 --> 02:00:46.205]  But if you go there... Yes, mail it to me.
[02:00:46.686 --> 02:00:47.006]  Okay.
[02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:51.530]  But these five guys, it turned out to be innocent, as I said yesterday.
[02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:57.515]  But the greatest, the biggest shock here is the mayor of this city has the audacity...
[02:00:58.255 --> 02:01:08.278]  After he and his police commissioner, both by word and unconstitutional deed, have been fanning the flames of paranoia in this city.
[02:01:08.298 --> 02:01:08.858]  Oh, they love it.
[02:01:08.978 --> 02:01:09.938]  Oh, we're going to be attacked.
[02:01:10.038 --> 02:01:11.459]  Oh, no, give us all your rides.
[02:01:11.919 --> 02:01:20.361]  And he turns around and criticizes the bus driver and the bus company that alerted the police, of course, in a paranoid and panicked state.
[02:01:20.721 --> 02:01:26.543]  Well, it's like a plane that was supposed to go to England had to get diverted just because the guy was wearing a turban.
[02:01:27.043 --> 02:01:35.366]  Right, but you know what gets me is the people that fan the hyperbole, the people that engage in conduct that creates... Well, Ron, I meant to mention this the other day.
[02:01:35.406 --> 02:01:39.547]  Everybody gets confused how you'll have the government in England or the government in the U.S.
[02:01:39.627 --> 02:01:42.488]  impending doom, total destruction, millions will die.
[02:01:42.769 --> 02:01:44.809]  Oh, my God, the new flu is going to come out.
[02:01:44.889 --> 02:01:45.670]  Millions will die.
[02:01:46.110 --> 02:01:46.530]  They've actually...
[02:01:47.555 --> 02:01:53.981]  Meanwhile, you cut to Tony Blair, the bombings have gone off, total bombings, total destruction, and everything's fine, everything's good.
[02:01:54.421 --> 02:02:03.870]  That double-edged propaganda is to scare everybody, but then the figurehead is calm and a leader, so you look at them and, oh, they've got the answers.
[02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:05.512]  That's classic psychology.
[02:02:06.012 --> 02:02:07.594]  It's not even that sophisticated.
[02:02:07.874 --> 02:02:11.958]  You have the guy speaking one day out of his mouth, speaking paranoia, then the next day,
[02:02:12.518 --> 02:02:20.682]  He makes the smaller members of the population who react to his hyperbole, which is only natural, any sound person would understand that, the fall guy.
[02:02:20.722 --> 02:02:22.542]  But in addition to that, you know what else they're doing?
[02:02:23.043 --> 02:02:28.685]  The Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence in New York City has now, by the way, former CIA, you should know.
[02:02:29.285 --> 02:02:29.666]  They will.
[02:02:29.726 --> 02:02:30.027]  They will.
[02:02:30.047 --> 02:02:30.507]  We'll be back.
[02:02:46.477 --> 02:02:49.360]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.601 --> 02:02:50.301]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.382 --> 02:02:51.162]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.523 --> 02:02:56.208]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.529 --> 02:03:00.954]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.394 --> 02:03:05.559]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.779 --> 02:03:08.620]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:13.382]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.582 --> 02:03:18.004]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:25.446]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.706 --> 02:03:28.147]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:46.644 --> 02:03:51.146]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.486 --> 02:03:55.588]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.888 --> 02:03:56.429]  We listened.
[02:03:56.729 --> 02:04:01.711]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.991 --> 02:04:02.471]  We listened.
[02:04:02.872 --> 02:04:05.913]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.333 --> 02:04:06.853]  We listened.
[02:04:07.334 --> 02:04:10.435]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:04:10.435 --> 02:04:10.775]  I think.
[02:04:37.213 --> 02:04:40.175]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.195 --> 02:04:43.138]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:05:46.147 --> 02:05:48.348]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.368 --> 02:05:51.770]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:56.993]  The toll-free number to join us in this final hour is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:01.736 --> 02:06:03.976]  Tony Blair is on CNN.
[02:06:04.016 --> 02:06:06.457]  He says, World slept after 9-11.
[02:06:07.417 --> 02:06:17.799]  British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Tuesday that much of the world had dropped its guard to the threat of terrorism after the wake-up call of the 9-11 attacks of 2001.
[02:06:19.599 --> 02:06:20.439]  Oh, we slept!
[02:06:20.479 --> 02:06:31.321]  I thought we invaded two countries, butchered the Bill of Rights and Constitution, set up about ten new federal agencies, including Homeland Security and the Chief of Intelligence,
[02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:43.066]  Patriot Act passed, reauthorized, setting up domestic CIA groups in every major city, federalizing the police, but oh, things, I did guess, sleep.
[02:06:43.086 --> 02:06:45.027]  The borders are more open than ever.
[02:06:46.448 --> 02:06:51.671]  Checkpoints at the airports, groping and searching people, now checkpoints at bus stops all over the country.
[02:06:52.211 --> 02:06:55.232]  But Blair says, don't worry, we will not give an inch to the terrorists.
[02:06:55.252 --> 02:06:56.513]  Well, how do you give an inch to them?
[02:06:57.719 --> 02:06:59.720]  You would give an inch by getting rid of liberty.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:02.001]  You would give an inch by taking over freedom.
[02:07:02.041 --> 02:07:05.382]  So you gave, not an inch, you gave in completely.
[02:07:06.703 --> 02:07:09.684]  You know, like you were a woman head over heels for Romeo.
[02:07:10.845 --> 02:07:11.265]  West.
[02:07:11.665 --> 02:07:12.485]  The Western world.
[02:07:12.966 --> 02:07:14.746]  I mean, you fell head over heels for this.
[02:07:15.207 --> 02:07:15.747]  So don't give me...
[02:07:16.457 --> 02:07:21.442]  No, no, when they say we will not give an inch, giving an inch means we will worship our government mindlessly.
[02:07:21.482 --> 02:07:22.783]  We will give up all of our freedoms.
[02:07:22.983 --> 02:07:28.268]  We will submit and be groveling worms because 55 people died out of 40-something million.
[02:07:31.451 --> 02:07:32.492]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:07:33.893 --> 02:07:35.454]  It's totally ridiculous.
[02:07:37.436 --> 02:07:42.781]  I looked it up because I saw where those four or five Boy Scouts got electrocuted yesterday.
[02:07:44.648 --> 02:07:50.430]  Guess how many people get electrocuted a day in the United States?
[02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.430]  74!
[02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:54.071]  You can get a World Almanac and check it out.
[02:07:55.771 --> 02:08:00.573]  It varies from like, you know, 20 a day to 70-something a day, but right now that's the average.
[02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:03.594]  So I say ban electricity.
[02:08:04.134 --> 02:08:06.775]  I mean, have checkpoints everywhere for electricity.
[02:08:07.295 --> 02:08:13.697]  Have men in black ski masks that bust in houses and search around and bust open walls and look for...
[02:08:14.401 --> 02:08:15.522]  Live wires.
[02:08:15.582 --> 02:08:17.283]  People that secretly have electricity.
[02:08:17.704 --> 02:08:22.788]  I mean, electricity is killing tens of thousands a year in America.
[02:08:23.428 --> 02:08:24.549]  It is a scourge.
[02:08:24.609 --> 02:08:26.571]  A secret, invisible scourge.
[02:08:26.971 --> 02:08:27.932]  All around us.
[02:08:28.032 --> 02:08:28.752]  I mean, imagine.
[02:08:28.832 --> 02:08:31.555]  Al Qaeda is so foggy by electricity.
[02:08:31.575 --> 02:08:32.595]  There's light bulbs on.
[02:08:32.615 --> 02:08:34.097]  There's a lamp in front of me.
[02:08:34.557 --> 02:08:35.778]  It's wanting to kill me.
[02:08:38.143 --> 02:08:41.204]  You know, hundreds of people a week dying from electrocution.
[02:08:42.124 --> 02:08:43.384]  I don't know what the world numbers are.
[02:08:43.444 --> 02:08:44.205]  Is it thousands?
[02:08:44.265 --> 02:08:48.626]  Why these Boy Scouts just yesterday were electrocuted.
[02:08:50.466 --> 02:08:52.627]  It's time to ban it.
[02:08:52.787 --> 02:08:54.488]  Ban electricity.
[02:08:55.388 --> 02:08:57.548]  Are there more deaths every year from blunt objects?
[02:08:59.109 --> 02:09:01.670]  Hundreds and hundreds of deaths from Louisville Slugger baseball bats.
[02:09:01.730 --> 02:09:02.210]  Ban them!
[02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:02.670]  Ban them!
[02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:03.710]  I shouldn't joke.
[02:09:03.730 --> 02:09:06.831]  There's moves in London and in England to ban knives.
[02:09:07.779 --> 02:09:09.961]  Over, what, three or four inches even in your own cupboard.
[02:09:10.521 --> 02:09:12.263]  They're saying you don't need them.
[02:09:15.965 --> 02:09:16.346]  You don't.
[02:09:18.047 --> 02:09:18.968]  You don't need them.
[02:09:18.988 --> 02:09:24.032]  It's unbelievable.
[02:09:24.052 --> 02:09:26.594]  All right, let's...
[02:09:28.484 --> 02:09:29.764]  Getting to some more of the news here.
[02:09:29.784 --> 02:09:37.787]  Oakland requires ID chips for dogs, and that's really old news, but July 25th, this came out yesterday, I knew San Francisco did it last year.
[02:09:38.327 --> 02:09:39.427]  It's happening all over the country.
[02:09:39.487 --> 02:09:44.328]  You have no choice but to have a microchip embedded in your skin in Oakland, California, if you're a dog.
[02:09:45.209 --> 02:09:51.750]  So the officials have drafted an ordinance that requires dog owners to have a rice-sized ID chip implanted in their pets and see what's next, folks.
[02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:52.291]  See everything.
[02:09:53.191 --> 02:09:53.831]  This is sick.
[02:09:54.911 --> 02:09:57.252]  Anytime the government can make you do something with your property...
[02:09:57.901 --> 02:09:59.141]  It's not really your property, is it?
[02:10:00.962 --> 02:10:07.564]  I don't want to spend all day on this, but... Grand Theft Auto re-rated for porn scene.
[02:10:08.345 --> 02:10:10.605]  A tempest has struck the American video game industry.
[02:10:10.685 --> 02:10:12.106]  Yeah, that'll make them hundreds of millions.
[02:10:12.806 --> 02:10:22.229]  After the publisher of the country's most popular series, Grand Theft Auto acknowledged that its latest installment includes embedded pornographic content that allegedly was never meant to be seen by players.
[02:10:22.830 --> 02:10:23.530]  Yeah, just like...
[02:10:25.774 --> 02:10:30.118]  Tommy Lee and, oh, what was his blonde, bleach blonde girlfriend's name?
[02:10:31.018 --> 02:10:32.440]  I'm so out of the loop.
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:33.981]  Pamela Anderson.
[02:10:34.942 --> 02:10:38.284]  Later it came out, they released that on purpose for publicity, and it did.
[02:10:38.324 --> 02:10:40.226]  It skyrocketed her for like five years.
[02:10:40.246 --> 02:10:45.370]  Instead of making, you know, a million bucks a movie, she was getting like five million a movie and all these TV shows.
[02:10:46.211 --> 02:10:50.835]  That Paris Hilton little waif, she, you know, has this...
[02:10:51.738 --> 02:10:55.839]  Shoots this whole porno, has it edited, and then it's accidentally released.
[02:10:56.179 --> 02:10:58.680]  And now she's pitching stuff for Burger King or whatever.
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:00.920]  I mean, it's all staged, folks.
[02:11:02.801 --> 02:11:04.861]  It's all staged.
[02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:13.063]  The globally successful game sold one million copies in Britain in nine days when it was released last October, where it attracted an 18 certificate.
[02:11:13.604 --> 02:11:21.147]  This regulatory board in the United States that applies ratings to video games stripped the name of its mature ranking and upgraded it to adults only.
[02:11:21.588 --> 02:11:23.448]  And I've seen the screen saves online.
[02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:29.811]  It's gang members having sex with prostitutes, basically.
[02:11:30.512 --> 02:11:31.552]  And they've got some other game.
[02:11:31.572 --> 02:11:32.352]  What's it called?
[02:11:32.553 --> 02:11:33.653]  Carnicon?
[02:11:34.013 --> 02:11:34.513]  I forget.
[02:11:34.533 --> 02:11:37.875]  A game where you run over people.
[02:11:37.975 --> 02:11:39.956]  And in that one, it's like Grand Theft Auto.
[02:11:40.805 --> 02:11:43.627]  But in that one, you rape women and get bonuses.
[02:11:45.208 --> 02:11:48.110]  And I remember like six, seven years ago, they had a game Dungeon Keeper.
[02:11:48.150 --> 02:11:50.412]  I saw a review for it in, what, PC World?
[02:11:51.873 --> 02:11:59.919]  And you're this big demon who owns a torture chamber, and you kidnap children, and you torture them, and the more pain you bring to the child and adults, too...
[02:12:01.014 --> 02:12:20.775]  The more power you get, then you build a huge underground army, and then you invade the upper reaches, you know, from your subterranean pit, and you take over the good cities, and it said something in the review like, you know, build up your armies, build up your power, emerge and smash the smiling looks off their disgusting, beautiful faces.
[02:12:21.983 --> 02:12:23.083]  That was a best-selling game.
[02:12:23.123 --> 02:12:30.705]  I mean, I don't play video games when I don't have time to review them or really watch them, but whenever I'm at CompUSA, I'll look at the titles and read the facts.
[02:12:31.025 --> 02:12:34.186]  You're a UN soldier with microchips who slaughters militias.
[02:12:34.606 --> 02:12:38.927]  Next game, you're a commando with a super-secret anti-terror force.
[02:12:38.947 --> 02:12:43.708]  You deal with American excrement with the Delta Force and kill them.
[02:12:45.047 --> 02:12:45.608]  Another game.
[02:12:45.648 --> 02:12:46.348]  You're a U.N.
[02:12:46.448 --> 02:12:49.250]  pilot bombing the American Southwest during a rebellion.
[02:12:49.611 --> 02:12:50.751]  Oh, oh, next game.
[02:12:51.192 --> 02:12:54.694]  You're a world government enforcer fighting the terrorists.
[02:12:55.154 --> 02:12:57.936]  Under martial law, it's your job to stop the riots.
[02:12:57.976 --> 02:12:59.397]  If you have to kill people, do it.
[02:13:00.218 --> 02:13:00.778]  Next game.
[02:13:00.798 --> 02:13:01.459]  You're a U.S.
[02:13:01.579 --> 02:13:04.281]  Army commando sworn to slaughter terrorists.
[02:13:04.321 --> 02:13:04.841]  Next game.
[02:13:05.202 --> 02:13:08.624]  And I'll spend like 20 minutes going, oh my gosh, it's every game.
[02:13:10.305 --> 02:13:12.507]  And even the ones where you're not killing U.N., you know...
[02:13:14.171 --> 02:13:22.535]  Even the games where you're a UN soldier killing Americans, even when it's not that, it's you're ripping their intestines out and smashing their guts.
[02:13:22.955 --> 02:13:24.876]  They beg and you break their back.
[02:13:25.076 --> 02:13:31.459]  You are a smack leader crushing them with grog power.
[02:13:31.619 --> 02:13:34.641]  You're a demon army smashing the good people.
[02:13:35.121 --> 02:13:37.602]  I mean, it's just like every game I see, it's like this.
[02:13:38.182 --> 02:13:39.683]  I see the ads for them on TV.
[02:13:39.763 --> 02:13:40.904]  I see them on the Internet.
[02:13:40.944 --> 02:13:41.564]  I read about them.
[02:13:42.785 --> 02:13:43.765]  I go see movies!
[02:13:43.805 --> 02:13:45.166]  They've got ads for these games.
[02:13:46.906 --> 02:13:49.407]  And total propaganda.
[02:13:49.787 --> 02:13:54.369]  They've got games where you're a government agent releasing terror attacks to blame it on your enemies.
[02:13:55.489 --> 02:13:56.529]  Oh yeah, do sex.
[02:13:58.070 --> 02:14:02.411]  And then I get emails, well at the end of the game you defeat the Illuminati and you become the Illuminati.
[02:14:02.891 --> 02:14:03.672]  So what?
[02:14:03.732 --> 02:14:04.772]  Does it mean it's good?
[02:14:04.792 --> 02:14:09.274]  I know the creators are right here in Austin and obviously based on what we do, that's fine.
[02:14:09.294 --> 02:14:10.494]  Just like the Illuminati game.
[02:14:11.004 --> 02:14:20.170]  They have the Illuminati card game, you know, where in 99 they attack the World Trade Center for martial law, the government does, and the Pentagon, the exact same two places, smoking.
[02:14:21.811 --> 02:14:22.572]  Oh, you didn't know about that?
[02:14:23.973 --> 02:14:26.334]  Oh yeah, I owned the game before it even happened.
[02:14:28.916 --> 02:14:30.177]  That's a person we ought to talk to.
[02:14:30.197 --> 02:14:31.538]  All right, that's enough.
[02:14:31.998 --> 02:14:33.139]  Who's up next here in line?
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:36.461]  Robert in California, welcome, sir.
[02:14:38.291 --> 02:14:39.671]  Alex, great to talk to you again.
[02:14:39.811 --> 02:14:40.111]  Welcome.
[02:14:40.151 --> 02:14:40.752]  Good to talk to you.
[02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.052]  I'm one of your subscribers.
[02:14:42.112 --> 02:14:43.232]  I've seen all of your material.
[02:14:43.452 --> 02:14:45.313]  I follow this stuff as intensely as you do.
[02:14:45.973 --> 02:14:47.553]  I tape everything all day long.
[02:14:48.053 --> 02:14:49.214]  But I wanted to get to a point.
[02:14:49.234 --> 02:14:50.794]  I was listening to Michael Savage yesterday.
[02:14:51.554 --> 02:15:00.597]  And during the three hours, he must have two dozen times advocated acts of random violence against the enemy.
[02:15:01.117 --> 02:15:03.657]  Because, you know, we have to be worse than the enemy to beat this enemy.
[02:15:04.217 --> 02:15:06.478]  And so he was basically outlining the Northwoods
[02:15:07.113 --> 02:15:08.014]  He actually said that.
[02:15:18.186 --> 02:15:21.068]  I feel safe when I'm riding on the public transit system.
[02:15:21.088 --> 02:15:21.748]  No, I know.
[02:15:21.948 --> 02:15:22.929]  That's so conservative.
[02:15:23.369 --> 02:15:25.950]  That's the PR out of England and New York.
[02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:27.231]  Oh, isn't it great?
[02:15:27.291 --> 02:15:28.552]  We get to be searched.
[02:15:28.672 --> 02:15:30.533]  Oh, we know you all want to be searched.
[02:15:30.593 --> 02:15:33.814]  We're trying as hard as we can to search you.
[02:15:33.834 --> 02:15:40.498]  Well, that was the universal message across every radio talk show nationwide yesterday, that it's great to be searched.
[02:15:40.598 --> 02:15:43.019]  I'm finally going to be safe.
[02:15:43.099 --> 02:15:45.241]  Thank God I don't have to worry about my freedoms anymore.
[02:15:45.421 --> 02:15:47.082]  They're not worried about the border being wide open.
[02:15:47.122 --> 02:15:47.462]  Hell no.
[02:15:48.416 --> 02:15:55.983]  Well, Ann Coulter said a few months ago that we need to randomly start killing Iraqis and nuking and killing them.
[02:15:56.363 --> 02:16:00.667]  And she said the problem is we haven't had more of a clenched fist.
[02:16:01.588 --> 02:16:03.710]  No, the problem is there's been a clenched fist.
[02:16:04.991 --> 02:16:09.615]  It gets me worried, Alex, when they're openly now going to kick it up a notch and start saying...
[02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:16.015]  Openly, the Northwoods Project, which is, let's blame it on the enemy and just start creating total mayhem and chaos.
[02:16:16.035 --> 02:16:16.355]  Wait a minute.
[02:16:16.375 --> 02:16:19.238]  He actually said it's time to do stuff and blame it on them.
[02:16:20.559 --> 02:16:22.481]  Please, get the transcript from yesterday.
[02:16:22.641 --> 02:16:24.723]  He said it 20 times, at least.
[02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:26.684]  He outlined it at the cost of every hour.
[02:16:26.704 --> 02:16:27.625]  Let me explain something.
[02:16:27.645 --> 02:16:28.866]  People didn't believe it until they heard it.
[02:16:28.926 --> 02:16:37.274]  He actually said, and I haven't tuned in in probably six months, every time I tuned in, if you disagree with the government, it aids terrorists, you need to be put in a camp.
[02:16:37.694 --> 02:16:41.936]  And we can't have these lazy people getting free food, so it's going to be a forced labor camp.
[02:16:43.236 --> 02:16:48.398]  So now you're saying he said that the government should carry out a tax and blame it on Arabs.
[02:16:48.498 --> 02:16:52.579]  I swear to you, Alex, I will get the transcript and email it to you.
[02:16:52.819 --> 02:16:57.021]  That is totally... You know what, I was going to tell you... He said it over and over and over again.
[02:16:58.335 --> 02:16:59.216]  I can't believe my ears.
[02:16:59.256 --> 02:17:05.541]  I thought he was going to back off of it on the third hour, but no, he ended the show with, and don't forget, we need to be worse than the enemy to win this thing.
[02:17:05.981 --> 02:17:06.902]  I was like, oh my God.
[02:17:06.922 --> 02:17:08.984]  Well, that's what they tell these young gumbo guys.
[02:17:09.004 --> 02:17:14.308]  That's what they told the guys drilling the pillars a month before 9-11, planting those bombs in the towers.
[02:17:15.131 --> 02:17:15.911]  It's disgusting.
[02:17:15.951 --> 02:17:18.612]  Ned, you're on the cutting edge of defending America.
[02:17:18.672 --> 02:17:22.114]  We've got to do this to mobilize the people to fight the scourge.
[02:17:22.554 --> 02:17:25.975]  If we don't do it, there's going to be a bio-attack and your family's going to die.
[02:17:26.276 --> 02:17:27.496]  Are you ready, Red Leader?
[02:17:27.636 --> 02:17:28.636]  Yes, sir, I'm ready!
[02:17:30.917 --> 02:17:31.518]  Anything else?
[02:17:31.718 --> 02:17:32.798]  Fine slave zombies.
[02:17:32.878 --> 02:17:34.199]  Thanks for the good work you do.
[02:17:34.719 --> 02:17:35.099]  Keep it up.
[02:17:36.019 --> 02:17:36.440]  Thank you.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:38.961]  Yeah, and drink your fluoride and drink your aspartame, too.
[02:17:38.981 --> 02:17:40.681]  The government really cares about you, folks.
[02:17:45.544 --> 02:17:50.208]  Imagine enjoying your own health spa in the comfort of your own home daily at a fraction of the cost.
[02:17:50.448 --> 02:17:51.329]  No more imagining.
[02:17:51.529 --> 02:17:55.452]  It's time to experience the relaxing and rejuvenating Total Health Spa by HTE.

[02:19:44.887 --> 02:19:45.347]  Gold.
[02:19:45.687 --> 02:19:46.968]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:47.228 --> 02:19:53.310]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:53.490 --> 02:19:57.331]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:57.671 --> 02:19:59.551]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.892]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:02.032 --> 02:20:08.114]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that

[02:20:47.805 --> 02:20:53.448]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:20:53.749 --> 02:20:59.612]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:20:59.732 --> 02:21:05.716]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:21:06.016 --> 02:21:09.720]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.

[02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:59.043]  We haven't had him on in about a month and a half, two months, but the George Gallo interview was so important.
[02:21:59.123 --> 02:21:59.924]  Member of Parliament.
[02:22:00.704 --> 02:22:02.825]  We're going to be re-airing that coming up the next segment.
[02:22:04.647 --> 02:22:09.790]  As for Bin Laden's plan to put poison in cocaine, the globalists would never allow that.
[02:22:10.050 --> 02:22:12.531]  Our government controls most of the drugs that come in this country.
[02:22:13.812 --> 02:22:21.077]  This is just more fear-mongering, more made-up propaganda from the same government that told you Saddam had nuclear weapons.
[02:22:23.271 --> 02:22:24.151]  It's really that simple.
[02:22:24.171 --> 02:22:27.432]  Before we go to Robert and, well, Dave and Steve, if we have time.
[02:22:27.452 --> 02:22:31.793]  Before we get to Dave and Steve, just briefly, I didn't plug it last hour.
[02:22:31.813 --> 02:22:33.133]  I hope you'll listen to me when I say it.
[02:22:33.513 --> 02:22:34.893]  I've made some really good videos.
[02:22:34.973 --> 02:22:35.713]  You need to have them.
[02:22:36.333 --> 02:22:38.414]  Martial Law is my best video.
[02:22:38.514 --> 02:22:39.994]  Road to Tyranny is excellent as well.
[02:22:40.054 --> 02:22:44.555]  They both expose who really carried out 9-11 and what the Globalist Master Plan is.
[02:22:45.115 --> 02:22:46.235]  They're amazing films.
[02:22:46.275 --> 02:22:51.296]  Go to InfoWars.com to order the videos via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:22:52.324 --> 02:22:55.769]  You can peruse the films right there and watch free clips of them and read all about them.

[02:23:30.942 --> 02:23:33.063]  Now been operating for 16 months.
[02:23:34.153 --> 02:23:36.135]  We want to thank all the members that do support us.
[02:23:36.615 --> 02:23:39.297]  You are vital to our operations, so I commend you.
[02:23:39.518 --> 02:23:42.040]  But if you haven't gotten a membership, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:45.643]  But get my videos, bottom line, and make copies and get them out to folks.
[02:23:46.203 --> 02:23:48.985]  You can download and burn copies right there from the site when you're a member.
[02:23:50.006 --> 02:23:51.287]  Let's go to Dave in Texas.
[02:23:51.327 --> 02:23:51.948]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:23:52.751 --> 02:24:00.276]  Yes, Alex, I was wondering, I want you to address the issue of racism within the patriot movement, because I've started getting involved in it.
[02:24:00.677 --> 02:24:05.120]  I hear a lot of that stuff, and admittedly, it's not on Genesis, it's on another patriot network.
[02:24:07.842 --> 02:24:08.962]  Sir, we didn't cut you off.
[02:24:11.064 --> 02:24:11.584]  He's gone.
[02:24:12.545 --> 02:24:14.346]  He holds for 30 minutes and then cuts out.
[02:24:14.926 --> 02:24:17.568]  Call back if you're able to get back in, Dave.
[02:24:18.649 --> 02:24:21.271]  Dave, it depends on what you call racism.
[02:24:22.353 --> 02:24:23.574]  I call it tribalism.
[02:24:23.794 --> 02:24:25.774]  And I don't care what group you're with.
[02:24:25.814 --> 02:24:28.035]  If you love my freedom, I love your freedom.
[02:24:28.395 --> 02:24:29.916]  If you're going to be free, I'm going to be free.
[02:24:30.616 --> 02:24:32.397]  If you want to be free, you need to make sure that I'm free.
[02:24:32.657 --> 02:24:33.217]  Vice versa.
[02:24:34.218 --> 02:24:43.802]  But there are people who think they're getting away with something when they say bad things about other groups, physical things, things of that nature.
[02:24:44.822 --> 02:24:49.564]  And a lot of people do recognize the tribalism and the racism of other groups
[02:24:50.265 --> 02:24:54.568]  And so they think because that other group is racist that we should be racist, and that's not the case.
[02:24:55.269 --> 02:25:05.576]  We should address it according to their tribalism instead of descending into comments about the way these people look.
[02:25:06.477 --> 02:25:19.487]  Because I assure you, all whites are not racist, all blacks are not racist, all Jews are not racist or tribal, but their leaders tend to be because that's a primitive way to control that group.
[02:25:21.215 --> 02:25:22.716]  And so that's really what's going on.
[02:25:22.936 --> 02:25:30.640]  And, yeah, people try to accentuate themselves or try to note that they're different, you know, by going off into that.
[02:25:31.341 --> 02:25:33.862]  And, you know, it's fun to go, oh, look at Paco.
[02:25:33.902 --> 02:25:35.003]  He wants a chalupa.
[02:25:35.663 --> 02:25:37.104]  Or look at those black people.
[02:25:37.184 --> 02:25:38.344]  Or look at those Jews.
[02:25:39.085 --> 02:25:41.786]  And all it does is hurt the movement against the New World Order.
[02:25:42.287 --> 02:25:43.687]  And those people have got to be suspect.
[02:25:44.468 --> 02:25:46.649]  I know people who shoot their mouths off on talk radio.
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:51.782]  Where if I said something like that, calling for violence, I'd be arrested.
[02:25:52.482 --> 02:25:53.902]  Some of them are provocateurs.
[02:25:55.103 --> 02:25:59.245]  And the patriot movement is a big tent.
[02:25:59.285 --> 02:26:01.545]  The truth movement, the truth-seeking movement is a big tent.
[02:26:02.186 --> 02:26:07.668]  And so we all need to invite people under this tent instead of precluding folks.
[02:26:09.409 --> 02:26:12.450]  But I also think being oversensitive to it is just as dangerous.
[02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:13.410]  Who cares?
[02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:15.691]  Let people say what they want and do what they want.
[02:26:16.751 --> 02:26:18.893]  Let's, you know, we shouldn't be so freaked out by it.
[02:26:19.393 --> 02:26:22.776]  I don't get freaked out when Metra says all whites are evil and need to die.
[02:26:22.796 --> 02:26:24.957]  I just go, okay, well, we're going to expose you.
[02:26:25.718 --> 02:26:32.643]  You know, you shouldn't get freaked out if you're black and some toothless Klan members, you know, calling you devil men or something.
[02:26:32.683 --> 02:26:33.383]  Just laugh at them.
[02:26:34.124 --> 02:26:34.424]  You know?
[02:26:35.025 --> 02:26:36.546]  Let's talk to Steve in Texas.
[02:26:36.586 --> 02:26:37.306]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:26:38.187 --> 02:26:39.148]  Hey, just real quick.
[02:26:39.468 --> 02:26:41.129]  Earlier, y'all were talking about the Internet.
[02:26:41.469 --> 02:26:42.990]  Was it InternetTrafficReport.com?
[02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.130]  Yes.
[02:26:43.351 --> 02:26:43.551]  Yes.
[02:26:44.409 --> 02:26:47.171]  Okay, and y'all are on GCN Live, correct?
[02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:47.731]  Yes.
[02:26:48.492 --> 02:26:51.233]  Okay, have some of your viewers just check out GCN.com.
[02:26:51.273 --> 02:26:57.457]  That's the government... Oh, geez, I forgot the acronym, but that's actually government technology.
[02:26:58.618 --> 02:27:01.560]  We're the Genesis Communications Network, sir.
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:03.641]  This is GCN.com.
[02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:05.122]  Just have them try that out.
[02:27:05.142 --> 02:27:05.642]  GCN.com, okay.
[02:27:07.887 --> 02:27:09.607]  I don't want to start some new rumor, you know.
[02:27:10.048 --> 02:27:10.528]  No, no, no, no.
[02:27:10.548 --> 02:27:12.248]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:27:12.268 --> 02:27:14.149]  It's a predecessor of a lot of what comes up.
[02:27:14.509 --> 02:27:15.889]  It's discussed here first.
[02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.729]  All right.
[02:27:17.029 --> 02:27:18.010]  It's the contractors.
[02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:19.510]  Well, thank you.
[02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:20.070]  Send me that.
[02:27:21.251 --> 02:27:22.071]  Thank you so much.
[02:27:22.231 --> 02:27:24.732]  Yeah, the name of the network is Genesis.
[02:27:25.652 --> 02:27:27.772]  There's also a porno magazine called Genesis.
[02:27:28.513 --> 02:27:32.214]  If I get one more email saying that we're owned by Genesis Magazine, I'm going to get mad.
[02:27:32.994 --> 02:27:33.634]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.845 --> 02:27:36.746]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.246 --> 02:27:38.847]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.768 --> 02:27:42.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.729 --> 02:27:48.091]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.331 --> 02:27:52.195]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:27:52.515 --> 02:27:53.316]  Read the labels.
[02:27:53.756 --> 02:27:57.860]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.100 --> 02:28:02.303]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.664 --> 02:28:07.548]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:07.928 --> 02:28:11.509]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:11.689 --> 02:28:17.031]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.291 --> 02:28:20.031]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.332 --> 02:28:21.232]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:21.532 --> 02:28:32.255]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:28:45.091 --> 02:28:51.353]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.473 --> 02:28:57.656]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:57.916 --> 02:29:06.299]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.599 --> 02:29:13.666]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:13.927 --> 02:29:18.772]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:18.972 --> 02:29:24.397]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:24.738 --> 02:29:27.781]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.121 --> 02:29:36.053]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.133 --> 02:29:36.714]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.404 --> 02:29:45.924]  We're good to go.
[02:30:08.482 --> 02:30:09.143]  We're good to go.
[02:30:25.623 --> 02:30:26.064]  Death?
[02:30:26.144 --> 02:30:27.945]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[02:30:28.186 --> 02:30:31.849]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[02:30:31.869 --> 02:30:35.133]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[02:30:35.153 --> 02:30:35.693]  That's 866-295-5305.
[02:30:35.733 --> 02:30:36.214]  Call now.
[02:30:59.768 --> 02:31:02.049]  I heard that you are a free speech mind.
[02:31:03.109 --> 02:31:04.790]  I tell you, he's great to talk to in person.
[02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:08.591]  I just got a chance to talk to Mr. Galloway for the last few minutes during the break.
[02:31:08.611 --> 02:31:11.811]  We'll be talking to him live here in just a minute or two.
[02:31:11.831 --> 02:31:17.253]  An unbelievably intelligent and courageous individual.
[02:31:17.293 --> 02:31:21.154]  I wish we had more politicians like him here in the United States, but he's a statesman.
[02:31:22.086 --> 02:31:29.233]  And basically left the Labor Party because he refused to go along with their propaganda with Tony Blair and the CIA and MI6.
[02:31:29.854 --> 02:31:37.381]  And now he has just turned the tables on the lying neocons who were bearing false witness against him.
[02:31:37.401 --> 02:31:42.987]  And he's winning lawsuits against liars and other perpetrators of mass murder in Iraq.
[02:31:43.347 --> 02:31:44.768]  And so I want to just commend him.
[02:31:44.989 --> 02:31:46.410]  But here's about two minutes.
[02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:53.692]  I gave my political life's blood to try to stop the mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq, which killed a million Iraqis, most of them children.
[02:32:15.817 --> 02:32:19.419]  Most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis.
[02:32:20.179 --> 02:32:24.301]  But they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis.
[02:32:24.842 --> 02:32:28.003]  With the misfortune to be born at that time.
[02:32:29.064 --> 02:32:36.647]  I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq.
[02:32:37.648 --> 02:32:43.131]  And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies.
[02:32:44.401 --> 02:32:50.753]  I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims, did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:32:51.514 --> 02:32:57.465]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to Al-Qaeda.
[02:32:58.223 --> 02:33:06.187]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9-11-2001.
[02:33:06.728 --> 02:33:21.916]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[02:33:22.725 --> 02:33:29.928]  Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong.
[02:33:30.468 --> 02:33:33.129]  And a hundred thousand people have paid with their lives.
[02:33:33.689 --> 02:33:39.712]  Sixteen hundred of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies.
[02:33:40.252 --> 02:33:45.994]  Fifteen thousand of them wounded, many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies.
[02:33:46.534 --> 02:33:51.236]  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded,
[02:33:51.926 --> 02:34:06.158]  If the world had listened to President Chirac, who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor, if the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we're in today.
[02:34:06.958 --> 02:34:10.441]  Senator, this is the mother of all smokescreens.
[02:34:11.342 --> 02:34:20.349]  You are trying to divert attention from the crimes that you supported, from the theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth.
[02:34:21.573 --> 02:34:24.634]  Have a look at the real oil for food scandal.
[02:34:25.174 --> 02:34:36.436]  Have a look at the 14 months you were in charge of Baghdad, the first 14 months, when 8.8 billion dollars of Iraq's wealth went missing on your watch.
[02:34:37.096 --> 02:34:45.038]  Have a look at Halliburton and the other American corporations that stole not only Iraq's money, but the money of the American taxpayer.
[02:34:45.778 --> 02:34:48.319]  Have a look at the oil that you didn't even meter.
[02:34:49.122 --> 02:34:54.627]  That you were shipping out of the country and selling, the proceeds of which went who knows where.
[02:34:54.947 --> 02:35:04.055]  Have a look at the $800 million you gave to American military commanders to hand out around the country without even counting it or weighing it.
[02:35:04.175 --> 02:35:04.515]  Alright.
[02:35:05.556 --> 02:35:08.979]  Now, again, it goes on and on, and he totally turned the tables on them.
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:14.083]  This is the same crew that lied about Mr. Galloway, the Honorable Mr. Galloway, Member of Parliament.
[02:35:14.524 --> 02:35:15.625]  This is the same crew.
[02:35:16.678 --> 02:35:26.405]  That creates fake Niger uranium documents, that uses 12-year-old graduate student documents, that holds up vials of anthrax and comes up with 45-minute missile stories.
[02:35:26.725 --> 02:35:32.870]  This is the same crew that tried to plant weapons of mass destruction over and over again and always got caught lying.
[02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:35.672]  This is the crew that ordered the CIA to lie.
[02:35:35.712 --> 02:35:40.175]  This is the crew involved in all the bid rigging and Dick Cheney running the contracts out of the White House.
[02:35:40.615 --> 02:35:44.278]  Okay, enough of Mr. Galloway's earlier statements and my comments.
[02:35:44.558 --> 02:35:46.739]  Mr. Galloway, it's a great honor to have you joining us.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:47.780]  It's a great pleasure.
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:48.501]  Anytime at all.
[02:35:49.662 --> 02:36:00.629]  Please give us in a nutshell what really happened here and then any new developments that you've discovered involving this monstrous fraud that they tried to falsely paint you with.
[02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:04.872]  Well, I think that the comments you've just made really sum it up.
[02:36:04.932 --> 02:36:08.555]  This is mendacity on a militarized scale.
[02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:26.814]  The British and American states were involved in spinning a story so vile and such a monumental lie that they will be damned forever in the history books and beyond that into the hellfires themselves.
[02:36:27.463 --> 02:36:32.409]  Because they have killed a huge number of people on that pack of lies.
[02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:35.153]  This is not just like lying to win an election.
[02:36:35.573 --> 02:36:39.138]  It's not lying about what you think of the economic curve.
[02:36:39.559 --> 02:36:42.723]  It's not lying on a normal political scale.
[02:36:43.323 --> 02:36:52.853]  This is lying on a scale that has plunged the world into a disaster, the bottom of which we have very definitely not yet reached.
[02:36:53.474 --> 02:37:05.206]  The reverberations of the war on Iraq, the invasion and its occupation, will continue as long as you and I are alive and probably as long as our children are alive.
[02:37:05.746 --> 02:37:11.129]  They have scarred the face of the international legal and political systems.
[02:37:11.649 --> 02:37:18.413]  They have undermined respect for democratic government in your country and in mine.
[02:37:18.993 --> 02:37:24.816]  They have polarized the world between the West and the East, between the North and the South.
[02:37:25.416 --> 02:37:32.980]  They have made hundreds of millions of people hate us even more intently than they already hated us.
[02:37:33.579 --> 02:37:41.981]  And with a charge sheet like that, it's no wonder that those responsible are throwing up what I call the mother of all smoke screens.
[02:37:42.461 --> 02:37:45.242]  Because they have to fool us one more time.
[02:37:45.722 --> 02:37:50.664]  They have to take our eyes off the real issues and the real villains of the peace.
[02:37:51.284 --> 02:37:58.986]  And so they construct false villains, windmills at which they wish the people to tilt, like Kofi Annan.
[02:37:59.645 --> 02:38:06.084]  Who has enriched them forever by describing their war as an illegal war.
[02:38:06.676 --> 02:38:08.196]  Meaning that they are criminals.
[02:38:08.597 --> 02:38:25.001]  Those responsible for an illegal war are, what they said at Nuremberg in 1945, guilty of the, and I quote, paramount war crime, which is a crime of aggression, the illegal invasion of another people's country.
[02:38:25.742 --> 02:38:30.443]  These people want to turn your ire against President Chirac in France.
[02:38:31.056 --> 02:38:33.781]  Against people like me in the anti-war movement in Britain.
[02:38:34.262 --> 02:38:38.409]  Against people like Scott Ritter, the former American arms inspector.
[02:38:38.789 --> 02:38:40.232]  They want to have you running around
[02:38:51.481 --> 02:38:54.484]  We're talking to the Member of Parliament, George Galloway.
[02:38:55.125 --> 02:39:02.532]  And George, are there any particular websites or places you'd like to point our listeners so they can kind of get an idea of what really happened here?
[02:39:02.572 --> 02:39:04.354]  Because I want to go into how they tried to forge...
[02:39:04.754 --> 02:39:07.277]  Yes, they did, and people can read about it at the respectcoalition.org.
[02:39:07.297 --> 02:39:09.439]  That's www.respectcoalition, all one word.
[02:39:26.989 --> 02:39:33.092]  Yes, the forged documents couldn't keep up with the other forgeries, and therefore were throwing up mutually incompatible stories.
[02:39:33.112 --> 02:39:36.053]  If I take one that's of particular interest to American listeners,
[02:39:51.147 --> 02:40:07.770]  It is the one perpetrated by the Christian Science Monitor, generally regarded as one of the world's great newspaper titles, but who purchased a set of documents from someone claiming to be an Iraqi general within a few days of the fall of Baghdad.
[02:40:08.613 --> 02:40:21.141]  They placed on their front page around the world, and on their website around the world, that I had received $10 million from a son of Saddam Hussein whom I had never met.
[02:40:21.241 --> 02:40:24.262]  But it turns out the Oil for Food program didn't even exist then.
[02:40:24.563 --> 02:40:25.003]  Exactly.
[02:40:25.463 --> 02:40:35.469]  A son of Saddam Hussein I had never even met, and starting in a year I had never yet set foot in Iraq, and finishing on a given date, an actual date,
[02:40:36.155 --> 02:40:52.683]  When instead of being in Iraq, as they claimed, collecting another million dollar check, which is another ludicrous aspect to it, Iraq, of course, under quarantine, was not part of the international banking system, so a check from the Iraqi regime would have been as useful as toilet paper.
[02:40:53.843 --> 02:41:06.446]  The date that they chose, I was in fact demonstrably in the House of Commons on the Guardian website doing an interactive interview with the Guardian's readers.
[02:41:06.946 --> 02:41:16.028]  Now, I said on the day they called me about this in the English press because the Christian Science Monitor made no effort to contact me or put that
[02:41:16.707 --> 02:41:19.909]  allegation to me, which is... And by the way, your background is journalism.
[02:41:19.949 --> 02:41:21.129]  You know about real journalism.
[02:41:21.249 --> 02:41:26.532]  I do know about journalism, and I am a columnist and a journalist of many years standing.
[02:41:27.072 --> 02:41:38.618]  But when the English press, following this story up, contacted me, and I told them the truth, I was denounced by the neocon journals in the United States.
[02:41:38.738 --> 02:41:39.858]  I was clearly guilty.
[02:41:40.238 --> 02:41:44.280]  According to them, I had become a multi-millionaire thanks to Saddam Hussein.
[02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:45.781]  The only problem is,
[02:41:46.625 --> 02:41:52.453]  And then an English newspaper bought a set of documents off the same ersatz general.
[02:41:53.174 --> 02:41:56.979]  And they subjected their documents to forensic examination.
[02:41:57.643 --> 02:42:17.369]  Only to discover that the signatures on them were forged, that the information within the documents was mutually contradictory, and when I gave them my passports to check the dates I had come and gone from Iraq, they didn't match up with the times I was supposed to be in Iraq picking up money.
[02:42:17.770 --> 02:42:21.871]  Now, as you said... The Christian Science Monitor then forensically examined their own documents.
[02:42:22.361 --> 02:42:26.466]  You might think they should have done that before they published the smear against me.
[02:42:26.987 --> 02:42:33.776]  But they subjected their own documents to chemical ink, forensic analysis, and the whole thing came down like a pack of cards.
[02:42:34.316 --> 02:42:41.085]  It was a crude set of forgeries, but an intricate one, and one which had been done within days of the fall of Baghdad.
[02:42:41.525 --> 02:42:45.227]  Now, sir, you have never, as you've said, taken one thin dime.
[02:42:45.567 --> 02:42:57.332]  You, and you're on record, I went and checked it in LexisNexis, you had actually protested our government's giving Saddam the anthrax, the botulism, the chemical weapons decades ago.
[02:42:57.632 --> 02:43:05.775]  Yes, and I'll tell you what, not one of the new Labour government that's currently in power and in league with George Bush was with me on the protest.
[02:43:06.296 --> 02:43:06.876]  Not one of them.
[02:43:07.347 --> 02:43:15.231]  No Tony Blairs, no Jack Straws, nobody from the current New Labour hierarchy ever set foot on any of our demonstrations.
[02:43:15.691 --> 02:43:35.861]  As a matter of fact, when we were demonstrating outside Downing Street against the presence there of the Iraqi government leaders, Douglas Hurd, who was then the Foreign Office Minister, told the Iraqi leaders that we who were protesting for democracy and human rights in Iraq were just a bunch of communist troublemakers.
[02:43:36.562 --> 02:43:37.663]  And that's what we were doing.
[02:43:37.723 --> 02:43:48.491]  We were accused of causing trouble for those who were making big money out of the special relationship that British and American companies had with the Iraqi regime.
[02:43:48.931 --> 02:44:01.921]  I want to know, there's so many forgeries and so many lies, and those are now admitted to be lies, by the papers that did it themselves, but the neocons, sir, I listened to them, they're still slandering you and still crucifying you on a daily basis.
[02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:03.302]  Yes, they are.
[02:44:03.522 --> 02:44:06.548]  But I fear that fewer and fewer people are listening.
[02:44:07.189 --> 02:44:14.223]  My impression of my very brief visit to the United States, which I hope to follow up with a speaking tour over the summer months,
[02:44:15.418 --> 02:44:21.102]  Is that there are a vast number of American citizens who've already seen through this crew.
[02:44:21.562 --> 02:44:22.562]  This neocon.
[02:44:22.723 --> 02:44:23.703]  A lot of their supporters.
[02:44:23.723 --> 02:44:24.624]  A Christian fundamentalist.
[02:44:24.744 --> 02:44:26.345]  A lot of their former supporters.
[02:44:26.845 --> 02:44:27.145]  Yes.
[02:44:28.206 --> 02:44:36.390]  By the way, one of the amazing things about your neocons is that so many of them used to be Klotskists and Marxists of one variety or another.
[02:44:36.851 --> 02:44:40.073]  They've exchanged one zealotry for another zealotry.
[02:44:40.553 --> 02:44:44.115]  Even though it's facing an entirely the opposite direction to the one they used to face.
[02:44:44.824 --> 02:44:55.526]  But my impression is that fewer and fewer people are listening to these neocon journals and websites because I've had this fantastic response from the people of the United States.
[02:44:55.906 --> 02:45:00.767]  And I'm looking forward to meeting many of them at the speaking engagements I do in the United States over the summer.
[02:45:00.987 --> 02:45:03.848]  You told me that you've gotten 20,000 emails from Americans.
[02:45:03.908 --> 02:45:04.168]  Yes.
[02:45:04.188 --> 02:45:06.308]  20,000 emails.
[02:45:06.568 --> 02:45:10.289]  And it's not easy for an American to get hold of the email address
[02:45:11.042 --> 02:45:17.426]  Of a British member of Parliament, which is, by the way, GallowayG at Parliament.UK.
[02:45:17.846 --> 02:45:19.968]  GallowayG at Parliament.UK.
[02:45:20.128 --> 02:45:21.028]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:45:21.148 --> 02:45:22.749]  The better, we should all stay in touch.
[02:45:23.089 --> 02:45:30.514]  We should make a big network on both sides of the Atlantic, because your country and my country are the biggest problems in the world today.
[02:45:30.874 --> 02:45:32.335]  We're the biggest rogue states.
[02:45:32.805 --> 02:45:33.606]  In the world today.
[02:45:33.926 --> 02:45:36.407]  And the citizens have got to take back control of the plane.
[02:45:36.788 --> 02:45:40.570]  Well, Mr. Galloway, isn't it that the elite corporations aren't even free market now?
[02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:46.995]  They've seized control of Airstrip One England and the United States as an engine of global domination?
[02:45:47.455 --> 02:45:48.796]  That's absolutely right.
[02:45:48.876 --> 02:45:51.858]  Military spending is the welfare of capitalism.
[02:45:52.298 --> 02:45:56.201]  It's being used war after war to prime the pumps
[02:45:56.841 --> 02:46:08.264]  Of the big corporations, some of the profits from those corporations goes back into the political system as recycled campaign dollars and then the governments hand out the contracts all over again.
[02:46:08.284 --> 02:46:16.905]  Well, sir, this year we had record numbers of weapons being sold to third world dictators and in five years our government will then invade those countries calling them dictators.
[02:46:17.125 --> 02:46:17.806]  Exactly so.
[02:46:18.006 --> 02:46:23.747]  And we have a big arms fair coming up in my own constituency in East London later this year
[02:46:24.387 --> 02:46:34.494]  And when it was last year, two years ago, and we turned up to protest, the government turned out an anti-terrorist order to blockade the area.
[02:46:35.054 --> 02:46:38.316]  Not against the dictators that were inside buying arms,
[02:46:38.877 --> 02:46:43.580]  But against the peaceful protesters who are outside complaining about it.
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:49.524]  And as you say, they will very quickly invade those countries, calling them dictators, having just armed them.
[02:46:49.805 --> 02:46:52.106]  Mr. Galloway, we don't have a lot of time left with you.
[02:46:52.146 --> 02:47:03.234]  I wanted to get into any new developments concerning the neocons and their real profiteering from the war, and any new developments, because when you were there in front of the Senate, I mean, they looked scared.
[02:47:03.254 --> 02:47:07.457]  Did they expect you to come back and fight them, or did they think you'd just take it?
[02:47:07.877 --> 02:47:09.438]  Well, the truth has wings.
[02:47:09.958 --> 02:47:11.458]  And God gave me wings that day.
[02:47:11.538 --> 02:47:12.499]  I was really flying.
[02:47:12.519 --> 02:47:14.599]  I know this subject inside out.
[02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:20.401]  And I was right, as was the anti-war movement in both the United States and Great Britain.
[02:47:20.822 --> 02:47:21.742]  We said...
[02:47:22.333 --> 02:47:24.595]  Exactly what would happen, and it's now happening.
[02:47:24.635 --> 02:47:30.300]  And since I was in front of that committee in Washington, some more brave American boys have lost their lives.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.061]  Others have lost their limbs.
[02:47:32.481 --> 02:47:34.803]  And many, many more Iraqis have been killed.
[02:47:35.304 --> 02:47:40.028]  In the month of May, almost a thousand people lost their lives in one month.
[02:47:40.728 --> 02:47:42.670]  And that's just the ones we brought up to count.
[02:47:43.382 --> 02:47:50.925]  The number of operations taking place in Iraq between the resistance and the occupation forces is now at record levels.
[02:47:51.505 --> 02:47:56.347]  Just months after they told us that there was an election in Iraq and that was the beginning of the end.
[02:47:56.787 --> 02:47:59.408]  They've trumpeted the beginning of the end so many times.
[02:47:59.907 --> 02:48:01.388]  Nobody's listening anymore.
[02:48:01.868 --> 02:48:05.309]  In fact, we're in for a long, bloody haul in Iraq.
[02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:08.571]  And many more young American boys will lose their lives as a result.
[02:48:08.791 --> 02:48:11.592]  That's what I wanted to ask you, is where do you think all this is going?
[02:48:12.133 --> 02:48:14.494]  Well, I think Britain and America are sunk in a swamp.
[02:48:14.554 --> 02:48:16.254]  They can't go forward, they can't go back.
[02:48:16.835 --> 02:48:24.498]  If they withdraw out of the cities, into the camps that they're building, the resistance will take over control of the streets overnight.
[02:48:25.098 --> 02:48:26.279]  If they stay on the streets...
[02:48:26.719 --> 02:48:28.880]  They'll be the target for the resistance.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:31.300]  The resistance is getting stronger and stronger.
[02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:33.080]  You know, Mr. Galloway, we're out of time.
[02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:37.041]  Can I hold you just a few more minutes after the break so you can give us more of your analysis?
[02:48:37.321 --> 02:48:38.242]  Of course you can, sir, yes.
[02:48:38.302 --> 02:48:39.402]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:48:39.442 --> 02:48:40.582]  We're really honored to have you.
[02:48:41.502 --> 02:48:45.443]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:46.123 --> 02:48:49.004]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:49.808 --> 02:48:50.409]  We're good to go.
[02:49:04.548 --> 02:49:06.069]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:49:24.415 --> 02:49:24.796]  That's 1-888-2533-139.
[02:49:24.816 --> 02:49:26.578]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:49:26.658 --> 02:49:28.480]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:30.262]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:30.282 --> 02:49:32.445]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:44.961 --> 02:49:52.467]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.748 --> 02:50:03.657]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:03.917 --> 02:50:05.738]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:50:05.998 --> 02:50:09.321]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.661 --> 02:50:11.002]  But it's worth every penny.
[02:50:11.142 --> 02:50:20.128]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.408 --> 02:50:20.908]  That's right.
[02:50:21.108 --> 02:50:28.193]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.493 --> 02:50:37.237]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.257 --> 02:50:37.757]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:47.090 --> 02:50:48.831]  From pain, illness, and disease.
[02:50:48.991 --> 02:50:52.153]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[02:50:52.373 --> 02:50:57.417]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:50:57.697 --> 02:51:05.602]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:51:05.762 --> 02:51:12.807]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:51:13.027 --> 02:51:14.228]  There are no side effects.
[02:51:14.388 --> 02:51:17.791]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:51:17.831 --> 02:51:18.952]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:51:19.233 --> 02:51:20.514]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:51:20.734 --> 02:51:27.560]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:30.183]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:51:30.303 --> 02:51:33.345]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[02:51:33.365 --> 02:51:33.405]  866-885-6625.
[02:51:39.711 --> 02:51:40.594]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:51:51.326 --> 02:51:53.248]  A big guest coming up in the third hour.
[02:51:53.328 --> 02:51:58.852]  Our government knowingly knew that HIV and hepatitis was in the blood supply and shipped it all over the world.
[02:51:58.973 --> 02:52:00.234]  Europe, Canada, and the U.S.
[02:52:00.634 --> 02:52:03.376]  Tens of thousands got HIV and hepatitis from it.
[02:52:03.696 --> 02:52:04.877]  That's in the BBC today.
[02:52:05.458 --> 02:52:07.179]  We'll be covering that coming up in the third hour.
[02:52:07.239 --> 02:52:08.961]  We've got Mr. Galloway for a few more minutes.
[02:52:09.001 --> 02:52:09.802]  Member of Parliament.
[02:52:10.883 --> 02:52:14.786]  A man of conscience who we really appreciate joining us today.
[02:52:15.832 --> 02:52:27.421]  Mr. Galloway, during the break I was talking to you, you're about to collect on $600,000 from your libel slander suit against newspapers that printed these lies.
[02:52:27.841 --> 02:52:30.704]  Yes, $600,000 to me and about the best part of $3 million to the lawyers.
[02:52:34.446 --> 02:52:48.071]  So the costs and damages have been very great Saddam Hussein gave me nothing but the newspapers who alleged that he had are having to pay very dearly for those lies and where I can I will tackle
[02:52:48.627 --> 02:52:55.109]  The American outlets that are still peddling these same discredited lies about me.
[02:52:55.629 --> 02:53:02.291]  Unfortunately, these senators made their attack behind the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege.
[02:53:02.731 --> 02:53:05.212]  So I can't sue them for what they said about me.
[02:53:05.632 --> 02:53:07.152]  But I helped demolish it, I think.
[02:53:07.232 --> 02:53:10.973]  It was a house of cards that fell down with a bit of huff and puff from me.
[02:53:11.393 --> 02:53:14.194]  It all fell down because it was based on nothing at all.
[02:53:15.184 --> 02:53:19.348]  But a much more important issue is how we stop this disaster.
[02:53:19.388 --> 02:53:21.149]  Not just in Iraq, but around the world.
[02:53:21.570 --> 02:53:25.433]  We really have to pull our countries out of this coalition of the killing.
[02:53:25.913 --> 02:53:28.195]  Because it's making people all over the world hate us.
[02:53:28.696 --> 02:53:29.797]  It's damaging our interests.
[02:53:30.337 --> 02:53:38.921]  It's endangering our citizens when they travel or when they work and live abroad, and we really have to get out of this nosedive that we are in.
[02:53:39.441 --> 02:53:45.864]  So I hope that people will look at our website, that's respectcoalition.org, and will stay in touch with me.
[02:53:45.944 --> 02:53:54.707]  Send me, by any means, your email, gallowayg at parliament dot uk, and I'll let you know when my speaking tour begins, the big cities I'm going.
[02:53:55.188 --> 02:53:58.349]  One of the main places where there's a huge demand is Minnesota.
[02:53:58.951 --> 02:54:17.545]  Where they used to have an honorable senator called Wellstone, who was mysteriously killed in a plane accident, and who was succeeded by none other than the smarmy Norman Coleman, the man who chaired the Senate McCarthyite witch hunt into me, the author of The Mother of All Smokescreens.
[02:54:18.006 --> 02:54:19.727]  They said he was a presidential hopeful.
[02:54:20.087 --> 02:54:23.270]  He didn't much look like a presidential hopeful by the time I was finished with him.
[02:54:24.016 --> 02:54:25.718]  Just two more final questions.
[02:54:25.738 --> 02:54:26.338]  We're going to let you go.
[02:54:26.358 --> 02:54:28.881]  I know you're very busy, and it's evening over there in London right now.
[02:54:29.441 --> 02:54:34.386]  Mr. Galloway, George Galloway, looking at this, you've gotten to Iraq falling apart.
[02:54:35.647 --> 02:54:44.995]  The Pentagon's own P2OG documents, perhaps folks should send this to you, said they want to widen the hatred, cause more attacks as a pretext to invade more countries.
[02:54:45.356 --> 02:54:47.778]  Where do you see this ending, and will they go into Iran?
[02:54:48.753 --> 02:54:50.414]  I think they're too weak to do so.
[02:54:50.574 --> 02:54:53.916]  I think the Iraqi resistance has stopped them in their tracks.
[02:54:54.516 --> 02:54:59.118]  Undoubtedly, they planned to go into Iran and Syria for that matter.
[02:54:59.558 --> 02:55:04.520]  But I don't believe that the public opinion in your country or mine would follow them there.
[02:55:04.761 --> 02:55:07.502]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[02:55:07.542 --> 02:55:09.723]  They're saying they'll go ahead and may attack Iran.
[02:55:10.283 --> 02:55:18.007]  Well, there's an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[02:55:18.467 --> 02:55:22.930]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one he'll have to count us out.
[02:55:23.310 --> 02:55:25.551]  What if Israel drags us in?
[02:55:25.791 --> 02:55:26.932]  Well, that's a possibility.
[02:55:27.352 --> 02:55:28.733]  Israel might strike Iran.
[02:55:29.389 --> 02:55:35.933]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[02:55:35.993 --> 02:55:38.355]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:55:38.415 --> 02:55:39.295]  Well, I have another article.
[02:55:39.456 --> 02:55:42.157]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[02:55:42.237 --> 02:55:45.960]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:50.162]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[02:55:50.263 --> 02:55:57.007]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[02:55:57.467 --> 02:55:58.508]  We've got 30 seconds.
[02:55:58.528 --> 02:56:04.650]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack, deployment on them?
[02:56:14.854 --> 02:56:17.815]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[02:56:17.855 --> 02:56:23.818]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[02:56:23.858 --> 02:56:30.241]  We need a vigilant... This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
