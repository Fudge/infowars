[00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:06.283]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:08.004]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:09.844]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:11.305]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:17.587]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:21.949]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:32.933]  Well, well, well, my friends.
[00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:35.248]  Here we are.
[00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.569]  It's already the 28th day of January 2005.
[00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.330]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.971]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:46.031]  Wide open telephones throughout the day.
[00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:50.773]  In the middle of the next hour, we have a guest coming on to talk about chimeras.
[00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:55.274]  That is cross-species abominations.
[00:00:56.383 --> 00:01:05.769]  And now the mainstream media and the government is basically throwing it in our face just how far these travesties of life have gone.
[00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.334]  We're talking about humans mixed with pigs, humans mixed with chimpanzees.
[00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:14.715]  They're now announcing all of this.
[00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:20.899]  This has been going on for years, and these creatures they've been creating don't have any rights.
[00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:25.382]  What was that book, The Island of Dr. Maru or something,
[00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.840]  All of his monstrosities.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.942]  But now it's just no big deal.
[00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:37.625]  Also coming up, Masons bring child ID program to Fisher School.
[00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:42.827]  Another one, fingerprint technology gaining ground in school food service.
[00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:46.389]  Ah, got a thumb scan all over the country.
[00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.050]  It's spreading.
[00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.013]  And another one, see-through wall radar could have law enforcement applications.
[00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.907]  Out of the Globe and Mail.
[00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:57.189]  Oh, the police are going to be looking through your walls.
[00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.312]  They've been doing it for five years that I know of, by the way.
[00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:05.497]  And another headline here where they're announcing U.S.
[00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:07.799]  edges closer to national ID card.
[00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:16.466]  After they pass the national ID card, USA Today and everybody's been telling us, oh, it's kind of a national ID card.
[00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:18.068]  Knight Runner News Service.
[00:02:19.113 --> 00:02:19.493]  U.S.
[00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:22.395]  edges closer to national ID card.
[00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.977]  No, it's not edging closer.
[00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:24.657]  Okay?
[00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:27.219]  And Associated Press, U.S.
[00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.702]  terror program recruiting truckers and others.
[00:02:31.762 --> 00:02:33.724]  The TIPS program was never canceled.
[00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:42.750]  As we told you two years ago, it was simply doubled in size and had its name changed.
[00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:45.592]  And you hear it's a U.S.
[00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:47.814]  terror program, then you read the actual program,
[00:02:48.914 --> 00:02:51.375]  Did you see a man argue with his wife?
[00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:55.075]  He doesn't need to be touching her for it to be abuse.
[00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:57.096]  Is she yelling at him?
[00:02:58.016 --> 00:02:59.016]  That's illegal.
[00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:01.477]  That's emotional abuse.
[00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:03.237]  Call the police.
[00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:05.978]  Yes, this is actually in some of the manuals.
[00:03:07.258 --> 00:03:09.178]  Yes, it's down to that.
[00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.320]  Did you see someone smoking something in their car that looked like something other than a cigarette?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.460]  Hmm?
[00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.490]  You see, marijuana funds Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.290]  And if you fund Al-Qaeda, you're a terrorist.
[00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:26.211]  I'm not kidding.
[00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.272]  Well, you've seen the public service announcements of, Hey, I smoke pot.
[00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:32.732]  I'm not hurting anybody.
[00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:33.412]  Just myself.
[00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:34.933]  And that's what you think.
[00:03:34.973 --> 00:03:36.093]  You just funded Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.393]  And the guy goes, I did?
[00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:39.233]  And he goes, yeah, you did.
[00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:42.374]  Oh, man, you're a terrorist.
[00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:52.211]  This is as much a terrorist as those two ten-year-olds that drew stick figures with swords stabbing a classmate.
[00:03:52.971 --> 00:04:03.455]  Instead of them getting in trouble, it went to the state police and up to the Attorney General and they said, Seize them!
[00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:06.817]  And charge them with felonies!
[00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:10.098]  You're going to the big house, boys!
[00:04:12.412 --> 00:04:14.993]  How many of you would be in the pokey?
[00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:21.555]  How many of you men listening, you know full well what you drew in school.
[00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:25.396]  You know full well the kind of stuff that went on.
[00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:30.998]  And so most of us would be in prison.
[00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.919]  And that's the plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.080]  Criminalizing everything.
[00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:41.962]  There's a move to make not wearing a seatbelt a felony, by the way.
[00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:43.566]  Oh, yes.
[00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:46.890]  Everything will be felonies.
[00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:54.940]  Until you start going to prison for your thoughts themselves.
[00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.519]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.800]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.841]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:14.142]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:18.263]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:20.264]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.404 --> 00:05:23.705]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:24.845]  The medical bills...
[00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:28.449]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.654]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:34.698]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:41.307]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:42.327]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:03.390]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.633]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:13.058]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:20.725]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:24.989]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:30.811]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:44.135]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:06.920]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pets back in your step.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.101]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:25.585]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:29.066]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:31.687]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[00:07:31.887 --> 00:07:35.728]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:38.989]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.710]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.091]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition or just trying to beat the clock?
[00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:49.612]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:53.133]  Go to www.LifeWavePromotions.com.
[00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:56.894]  Again, that's www.LifeWavePromotions.com.
[00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:05.883]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.263 --> 00:08:08.605]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:27.619]  You know, I've become desensitized to news like this, but just look at some of the news I've got in my stack this Friday edition.
[00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:32.397]  Masons bring child ID program to Fisher School.
[00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:34.358]  I see one of these every week.
[00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:46.862]  It says the Herkmeyer Masonic Lodge is helping students at Fisher Elementary School take steps to provide for their safety should they ever turn up missing or lost.
[00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:56.145]  The lodge on Monday began a three-day child identification program at the school seeking to reach all students in pre-kindergarten through third grade.
[00:08:57.392 --> 00:09:07.856]  With their parents' permission, each student is being fingerprinted in one of the classrooms while students are also being videotaped in order to provide a record of their appearance, height, sound of their voice.
[00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:11.237]  Hey, why shouldn't parents just do this with the kids?
[00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:14.118]  Parents should care enough to do this for their children.
[00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:23.941]  Though kidnapping or disappearance is, I've looked at the statistics, one of the lowest statistical ways for a child to die.
[00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:29.032]  I mean, more children die in swimming pools than die from guns.
[00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:34.435]  And more children die in cars than die in swimming pools and from guns combined.
[00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:39.517]  And then way down the list, I've even got, every year I buy one of those almanacs.
[00:09:39.937 --> 00:09:41.137]  It's got all the numbers in it.
[00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:43.938]  Of course, that's because I'm a terrorist.
[00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:50.381]  According to the FBI alerts, if you have an almanac or a road atlas in your car, it may mean you're a terrorist.
[00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:53.803]  Oops, I just admitted I read books.
[00:09:54.183 --> 00:09:54.683]  Uh-oh.
[00:09:55.535 --> 00:09:57.135]  See, this is how ridiculous it's gotten.
[00:09:57.655 --> 00:10:00.956]  I actually just said that and thought, ooh, Al-Qaeda, ooh.
[00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:04.537]  You know, if you fight Al-Qaeda, you must be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:08.838]  But if you're with Al-Qaeda, like the administration that funds them, then you're against Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:13.219]  And I'm sure most of these low-level masons mean well.
[00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:14.519]  I think this is part of a good program.
[00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:22.301]  But this came down years ago from the big Supreme Lodge in D.C., and they collect all this stuff, and it goes into these big databases.
[00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:22.841]  We've caught them.
[00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:34.648]  In fact, I learned this from medical workers about 10 years ago, and since then it's been in ABC News Australia, it's been in a couple newspapers here in the U.S.
[00:10:34.688 --> 00:10:37.270]  because of lawsuits in Texas and Michigan.
[00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:53.080]  Every child born in a hospital in the last 33 years, started 33 years ago, they take ampoules of blood from a baby's heel in every hospital in the country.
[00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:55.340]  They take two to three ampules.
[00:10:57.542 --> 00:11:08.590]  One of the ampules goes to a state, but it's really federally, but it's a state office, depository, or repository.
[00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:10.932]  And it stays there.
[00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:12.473]  Freeze-dried.
[00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:20.619]  And then the other one does indeed go to the health department, as they tell the parents, for blood tests to make sure your child doesn't have any blood diseases.
[00:11:22.088 --> 00:11:23.229]  And I learned this years ago.
[00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:24.030]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.411]  It has since been in the news quite a bit.
[00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:32.596]  I've had a congressman on from North Carolina who was fighting it a few years ago, exposing it.
[00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:36.359]  So nobody asked you to go into a federal DNA database.
[00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.760]  Nobody asked your permission when you were born.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.141]  Nobody asked your parents that.
[00:11:40.942 --> 00:11:47.807]  If you're 33 years old or younger and were born in a hospital, they illegally took your DNA.
[00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:50.369]  Violated your Fourth Amendment.
[00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:54.232]  Now, the Supreme Court on Monday said there is no Fourth Amendment.
[00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:56.794]  The Fifth Circuit said it last year.
[00:11:57.475 --> 00:11:59.457]  But again, I don't recognize that.
[00:11:59.817 --> 00:12:03.601]  I didn't recognize it when the Supreme Court said black people weren't human beings.
[00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:07.064]  Or when they said Native Americans had no right to their lands.
[00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:08.425]  I don't think that's right.
[00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:13.130]  I don't think the Supreme Court's God, the Founding Fathers, knew it wasn't, and they said it wasn't.
[00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.412]  But it thinks it's God right now.
[00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:21.964]  It's like the White House says they're above the law, even federal, that actually the law issues from Bush's mouth.
[00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:26.407]  No, the law only issues from God's mouth, and you're not God, buddy.
[00:12:27.928 --> 00:12:36.092]  I know you'd argue with me about that, but... By the way, that's textbook tyranny when leaders start saying, I am the law.
[00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:37.793]  I'm Judge Dredd.
[00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.315]  Judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:44.177]  So there are the Masons buzzing around, getting the fingerprints...
[00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:54.295]  Like busy little bumblebees about fingerprint technology gaining ground in school food service.
[00:12:56.956 --> 00:13:00.857]  For those of you that have been listening for eight years, you know I've been screaming bloody murder about this.
[00:13:02.118 --> 00:13:03.619]  We warned you in Road to Tyranny.
[00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:11.042]  All over the country, from government facilities to private corporations,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.822]  Big factory lunch lines to public schools.
[00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:18.204]  It's happening in Canada, England, France, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:20.646]  The whole Western world's putting this in.
[00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:23.248]  No cash allowed.
[00:13:25.049 --> 00:13:28.631]  You are only allowed to pay with your thumbprint.
[00:13:30.112 --> 00:13:31.874]  And some schools have put retina scanners in.
[00:13:32.294 --> 00:13:33.755]  You want to check out a library book?
[00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.596]  You've got to scan your ID card.
[00:13:36.056 --> 00:13:36.857]  You wear it around your neck.
[00:13:37.237 --> 00:13:38.298]  And thumbprint.
[00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.080]  And they're putting RFID in the books.
[00:13:43.678 --> 00:13:48.743]  Again, training the children how to live under this societal control.
[00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.487]  And it continues.
[00:13:52.647 --> 00:13:53.788]  We even have the federal plans.
[00:13:53.808 --> 00:13:54.969]  This is to condition them.
[00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.634]  Fingerprint technology gaining ground in school food services from PR Newswire.
[00:14:01.796 --> 00:14:07.261]  Again, where I get a lot of news because the industries like to brag to each other via this PR Newswire.
[00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:15.789]  Fingerprint technology is now being harnessed at K-12 schools around the nation for school lunches.
[00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:21.932]  Students simply place a forefinger or a thumb on a small reader by the register.
[00:14:22.012 --> 00:14:32.596]  Public schools such as those in the Penn, Cambria, and Wilson school districts in Pennsylvania have adopted this technology, yeah, five years ago, to speed operation.
[00:14:33.846 --> 00:14:38.289]  Districts in Pennsylvania have adopted this technology again to speed operation.
[00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.793]  Simplify payment, limit lunch fraud and bullying.
[00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:48.156]  Can't have money, they say, because that could cause bullying.
[00:14:48.676 --> 00:14:55.881]  Improve national school lunch program participation and to improve reimbursement for programs...
[00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:05.378]  Such as Title I-E Rate and No Child Left Behind, which use NSLP food service data to gauge poverty.
[00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:14.225]  And I've read the stories where if your parents don't put money or forget to put money on your account each month, no cash allowed.
[00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:17.828]  You understand you can't buy credits there with cash either.
[00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:20.951]  Then CPS is notified.
[00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:23.233]  Also, what you're eating.
[00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:29.158]  They scan everything in your mind, and then it goes into a record instantly.
[00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:37.001]  It's like when you as an adult go to most grocery stores, and they go, that'll be $97 unless you have the loyalty card.
[00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:37.781]  It would have only been $65.
[00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:41.442]  Don't you want the card?
[00:15:42.223 --> 00:15:44.263]  Well, why do I get such a discount if I have the card?
[00:15:44.283 --> 00:15:45.944]  Well, it's a loyalty card.
[00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:50.926]  And by the way, we sell all your data to the NSA.
[00:15:51.837 --> 00:15:53.419]  And it's instantly hooked into their computers.
[00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:55.801]  By the way, that's all admitted, but they don't tell you that.
[00:15:55.861 --> 00:15:58.203]  The idiot behind the counter doesn't tell you that either.
[00:15:58.223 --> 00:15:59.064]  They just carry this out.
[00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:03.108]  But then you think, well, I won't go to Randall's here in Austin where they push this on you.
[00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:04.290]  I'll go to HEB!
[00:16:05.359 --> 00:16:07.481]  We're in College Station in Houston at some stores.
[00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:12.325]  They put thumb scanners in at the self-checkout lines and are taking out all the service lines and making you thumb scan.
[00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:15.448]  And then they already make their employees at all the HEBs thumb scan.
[00:16:15.468 --> 00:16:16.468]  They've called in here.
[00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:18.010]  I've walked up and videotaped it before.
[00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:28.278]  They've got signs up in Austin for two years saying, next month thumb scanners are going in, but people won't put up with it here in Austin because of, well, some troublemaking talk radio host.
[00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:29.920]  So they haven't implemented it yet.
[00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:32.663]  But I mean, it's all over the country.
[00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:38.605]  They've got Safeways in Northern California where they're going to get rid of the checkout counters entirely.
[00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:54.190]  They've got some of these test places, you know, test stores, but they've already gotten it down to one checkout lane and all the rest are little... The carts have a little computer on them and you swipe your card and thumb scan to make sure it's you.
[00:16:55.237 --> 00:17:03.040]  And then that radio beams back with the transmitters up in the walls, the antennas, and you just scan your goods as you go.
[00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:05.881]  Scan your goods as you go.
[00:17:06.482 --> 00:17:09.003]  See, it's going in everywhere.
[00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:11.164]  Listen to this.
[00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:17.486]  Unlike cash, tickets, and swipe cards, which can be lost or stolen, your fingers are always with you.
[00:17:18.186 --> 00:17:21.988]  And no one can use them to gain fraudulent access to your account.
[00:17:22.765 --> 00:17:29.967]  Says Brenda Bozinski, secretary to Penn-Cambria School District's food service director.
[00:17:31.888 --> 00:17:48.673]  Allaying fears of identity theft, Mitch Johns, president of Food Service Solutions, the company that implemented the biometric use of fingerprints in Pennsylvania School District, as well as across scores of schools and colleges throughout the U.S., is quick to point out that his system does not store any prints.
[00:17:49.406 --> 00:17:50.787]  Now, this is the same MO.
[00:17:50.927 --> 00:17:54.369]  I have them saying this in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:55.409]  Listen to this.
[00:17:55.429 --> 00:17:56.269]  This is very important.
[00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:06.895]  Only the numbers are retained in the form of a mathematical algorithm, and those cannot be re-represented into a fingerprint image, explains Johns.
[00:18:07.355 --> 00:18:16.079]  Both parents and students can rest assured that the images cannot be used by law enforcement for identification purposes.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.761]  Now, if you watch...
[00:18:20.382 --> 00:18:34.486]  Police State's Retotal Enslavement, you will see the CEO of Biometric Access, based in Austin, actually in a parasite of the city, Round Rock, north of us.
[00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:38.007]  That's what they used to call suburbs.
[00:18:38.067 --> 00:18:40.468]  It's the parasite of Austin, one of the larger parasites.
[00:18:41.648 --> 00:18:43.649]  And they are a parasite on Round Rock's back.
[00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.390]  Biometric Access...
[00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:48.234]  Right up the road.
[00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:54.337]  By the way, I had a confrontation with a biometric access employee one time in a Chewy's Mexican food restaurant.
[00:18:54.577 --> 00:18:55.658]  That's a whole other story.
[00:18:55.698 --> 00:18:59.440]  I actually heard him talking about it and laughing at the general public.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.061]  I walked out and confronted him.
[00:19:01.901 --> 00:19:02.261]  Bucked up.
[00:19:02.822 --> 00:19:04.443]  Again, another side issue.
[00:19:05.483 --> 00:19:14.068]  In Police State 3, just a few minutes of the film, I show their CEO on local news channel going, Don't worry when we thumbscan you.
[00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:15.649]  They're at HEB.
[00:19:17.938 --> 00:19:21.899]  It doesn't go into a law enforcement database, and don't worry, it's not an image of your thumb.
[00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:23.999]  It's just zeros and ones.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.420]  It's a digital algorithm.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:32.061]  Every digital photo, my voice right now going over a computer line is zeros and ones, but it's still my voice.
[00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:34.462]  It's total lawyer speak.
[00:19:35.682 --> 00:19:38.722]  And then he goes, and don't worry, it doesn't hook in with the police.
[00:19:39.843 --> 00:19:46.304]  Well, I walk into HEB, start interviewing the clerk behind the counter with a thumb scanner, and they go, oh yeah, it checks in with the state police.
[00:19:47.233 --> 00:19:47.893]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:19:47.913 --> 00:19:49.193]  They thumb scan you here.
[00:19:49.253 --> 00:19:50.174]  That's the database.
[00:19:50.654 --> 00:19:52.774]  You thumb scan here in this state to get a driver's license.
[00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:53.354]  It's 93.
[00:19:54.474 --> 00:19:55.894]  And then they admit it there at the store.
[00:19:56.815 --> 00:19:58.275]  I mean, it's just incredible, folks.
[00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:05.336]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[00:20:06.096 --> 00:20:14.358]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.578]  That's why you need verbal advantage
[00:20:17.387 --> 00:20:23.368]  While you listen, verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.569]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:20:26.089 --> 00:20:28.269]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.870]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.530]  And it's so easy.
[00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:35.251]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:36.711]  When you want.
[00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:37.892]  Where you want.
[00:20:38.712 --> 00:20:43.673]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:47.108]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[00:20:47.128 --> 00:20:47.268]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:47.929]  That's 419-W-O-R-D.
[00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:48.129]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.860]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.762]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:10.422]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:21:10.662 --> 00:21:12.203]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:17.664]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:21:17.964 --> 00:21:19.184]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:21.945]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:28.288]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:29.669]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:29.989]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:33.351]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:21:41.896 --> 00:21:47.400]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.461]  Get the map.
[00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:51.882]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.083]  The time is now.
[00:21:53.443 --> 00:21:55.765]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:59.447]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:22:00.726 --> 00:22:04.207]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:07.948]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:08.048 --> 00:22:11.989]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:18.391]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:18.792 --> 00:22:26.694]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:27.094 --> 00:22:32.456]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:32.616 --> 00:22:36.377]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:36.737 --> 00:22:38.597]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.838]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:22:41.078 --> 00:22:46.000]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:51.601]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:55.002 --> 00:22:58.844]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:23:00.805 --> 00:23:08.109]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:23:08.469 --> 00:23:13.151]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:17.253]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:23:17.474 --> 00:23:20.415]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:36.424]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:23:36.744 --> 00:23:43.028]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:23:43.228 --> 00:23:43.508]  That's 1-800-974-1879
[00:24:03.745 --> 00:24:09.768]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.368 --> 00:24:13.350]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:20.313 --> 00:24:24.956]  All right, David and Alex and Robert and Tim and others.
[00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:29.186]  We're going to be going to your calls here momentarily.
[00:24:29.206 --> 00:24:32.508]  I want to go to your calls quickly so I have your questions and comments ready.
[00:24:32.528 --> 00:24:36.871]  And then I want to get into see-through wall radar could have law enforcement applications.
[00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:39.772]  Oh, I'm glad the mainstream news is telling us about this.
[00:24:40.493 --> 00:24:45.355]  Because about five, six years ago, I saw the Defense Department press releases to industry.
[00:24:45.735 --> 00:24:51.799]  The local police department said, oh, we're going to be mounting your helicopters for free with stuff that looks right through people's walls.
[00:24:53.186 --> 00:24:55.852]  I don't mean like infrared where you just see the heat sources.
[00:24:56.413 --> 00:25:02.166]  I mean nice black and white images of you and your wife eating breakfast or doing whatever else.
[00:25:03.286 --> 00:25:07.428]  And this is all part of freedom, folks, living in glass houses, basically.
[00:25:07.888 --> 00:25:08.669]  I think it's wonderful.
[00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:09.869]  U.S.
[00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.770]  edges closer to national ID card.
[00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:24.457]  Again, it's already been passed, and so now Knight Rider News Service and AP and USA Today are all going, Oh, by the way, I'm afraid they passed something that, well, is a national ID card or close to it.
[00:25:24.517 --> 00:25:26.117]  I mean, you'll have to have it.
[00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:28.928]  Also, U.S.
[00:25:28.948 --> 00:25:33.549]  terror program recruiting truckers, all part of the TIPS program, but it had nothing to do with terror, though.
[00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:39.471]  Again, it's if you're seen arguing with your wife or husband, verbally, they are to call the police.
[00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:41.131]  That's it for you.
[00:25:41.791 --> 00:25:44.692]  And don't draw stick figures, either, with knives in their hands, or it's over.
[00:25:44.712 --> 00:25:45.412]  That's terrorism, too.
[00:25:46.272 --> 00:25:52.854]  North Korea has bought nuclear bombs, according to ABC News, and it's evil Pakistan that did it, but...
[00:25:53.663 --> 00:25:57.265]  But Pakistan, our government helped arm them, and that's our ally.
[00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:59.226]  I mean, they're not a threat, though.
[00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:00.827]  No, Iran is.
[00:26:01.688 --> 00:26:03.109]  Iran is evil.
[00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:05.670]  Because they don't have nukes and can't defend themselves is why.
[00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.671]  But that's the basic propaganda.
[00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:11.854]  And later, we've got a guest coming on about cloning cross-species.
[00:26:12.874 --> 00:26:13.335]  That's right.
[00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:22.380]  I mean, what's wrong with putting a little chimpanzee genes in a human clone and bringing it to term and birthing it, which they've already done, and then keeping it quiet and then announcing it?
[00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:25.473]  Just incrementally and saying, well, it's not a human.
[00:26:25.533 --> 00:26:27.074]  I mean, it's 10% chimpanzee.
[00:26:27.094 --> 00:26:28.495]  It doesn't have any rights.
[00:26:28.535 --> 00:26:31.397]  We can do medical experiments on it.
[00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:38.361]  We can do that, and most of you will laugh at people like Alex Jones if he even reads out of the Washington Post about it.
[00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:41.243]  Because you don't believe stuff like that exists, because you're still living in 1965.
[00:26:41.343 --> 00:26:44.886]  Let's talk to David Mostyn.
[00:26:44.906 --> 00:26:45.746]  David, welcome.
[00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:47.027]  How are you, Alex?
[00:26:47.367 --> 00:26:48.128]  Oh, I'm doing all right.
[00:26:49.657 --> 00:26:53.598]  Did you get, by the way, did you get that DVD of Smallpox that I sent to you?
[00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:58.019]  I sent that last week, so I don't know if... My dear, I got it today.
[00:26:58.479 --> 00:26:58.839]  Oh, really?
[00:26:58.919 --> 00:26:59.179]  Okay.
[00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:01.860]  That is, it came in yesterday and I opened it this morning.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:02.580]  Oh, good.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:08.901]  I meant to put it in my car so I could put an old clip of it on my TV show, and I think it's sitting at my other office.
[00:27:09.281 --> 00:27:11.142]  Yeah, well, at your leisure.
[00:27:12.622 --> 00:27:16.023]  Listen, I got an interesting police state story for you.
[00:27:16.383 --> 00:27:17.643]  I don't know if you heard...
[00:27:18.672 --> 00:27:25.316]  A company out of Lansing, Michigan, WICO, fires four employees for refusing smoking tests.
[00:27:25.917 --> 00:27:26.537]  Well, yeah.
[00:27:26.597 --> 00:27:27.538]  Did you hear that one?
[00:27:27.878 --> 00:27:29.279]  Yeah, that's happened in Florida.
[00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:30.160]  It's happened all over.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.761]  I'm glad you mentioned this.
[00:27:31.781 --> 00:27:34.202]  It's one of the things I forgot to spend time on yesterday.
[00:27:34.222 --> 00:27:36.204]  I just mentioned it briefly.
[00:27:37.004 --> 00:27:39.025]  Why don't you comment on it, and then I've got my comments.
[00:27:39.426 --> 00:27:47.371]  Well, essentially what they've done is that the guy, the CEO of the company, has instituted, and apparently the...
[00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:54.492]  The policy, I think, was initially instituted back in 2003, but I think they must have ramped it up.
[00:27:56.172 --> 00:27:59.033]  Anyway, they're essentially firing people.
[00:27:59.373 --> 00:28:01.054]  You can't even smoke after hours.
[00:28:01.114 --> 00:28:04.775]  The part that I caught was pretty amazing.
[00:28:05.035 --> 00:28:06.375]  If you smoke period, you're fired.
[00:28:06.515 --> 00:28:06.916]  That's right.
[00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:09.916]  Have you ever seen the movie Cat's Eye with James Woods?
[00:28:10.837 --> 00:28:11.697]  No, I haven't seen that one.
[00:28:12.785 --> 00:28:16.469]  Well, one scene in the movie, it's this kind of surreal, dystopic thing.
[00:28:16.949 --> 00:28:19.092]  It's like where there's this health club mafia.
[00:28:19.672 --> 00:28:20.954]  At first, it's quit smoking.
[00:28:21.354 --> 00:28:25.799]  Now you're going to not eat unhealthy food, or we're going to cut your wife's finger off.
[00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:27.681]  Basically, it's like this oppressive system.
[00:28:28.365 --> 00:28:30.026]  But actually, that's the plan.
[00:28:30.046 --> 00:28:44.133]  The different federal agencies have said, Arkansas passed a law last year, if your child is 2% overweight and doesn't lose it within six months, they take your child, even 2% overweight.
[00:28:44.173 --> 00:28:45.514]  And the indexes are quite skinny.
[00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:47.242]  You know, quite small.
[00:28:48.543 --> 00:28:50.826]  I mean, I think the indexes are a little bit low.
[00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:52.307]  And some people are big boned.
[00:28:52.728 --> 00:29:03.639]  But if this is the state getting involved there, you know, it starts with some huge obese child who weighs 250 pounds at 10 years of age, and they look like a giant frog and, you know, a crapoo.
[00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:06.581]  That means frog in French.
[00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:07.022]  Sorry, folks.
[00:29:07.282 --> 00:29:09.945]  But, you know, so this is going on.
[00:29:10.729 --> 00:29:21.635]  I heard that this morning, by the way, about them implementing the plan about, yeah, for children, now they have to conform to a certain weight category and it's going to be attached to their report cards.
[00:29:21.975 --> 00:29:23.436]  Yeah, but that's what you hear on the news.
[00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:23.937]  No, no.
[00:29:24.297 --> 00:29:26.418]  These are laws that are going to take your children.
[00:29:27.114 --> 00:29:27.955]  Right, right, yeah.
[00:29:28.035 --> 00:29:29.055]  That's very true.
[00:29:29.215 --> 00:29:30.536]  See, notice how they sell you the law, too.
[00:29:30.556 --> 00:29:31.717]  It's like the National ID card.
[00:29:32.177 --> 00:29:36.660]  There might be one kind of... But they don't tell you.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.081]  It's been passed, and it's horrible.
[00:29:38.782 --> 00:29:40.483]  Yeah, I mean, it's true.
[00:29:40.703 --> 00:29:42.084]  Yeah, that's absolutely the case.
[00:29:42.664 --> 00:29:44.025]  It's all part of the new freedom, sir.
[00:29:44.045 --> 00:29:45.186]  It sure is.
[00:29:45.746 --> 00:29:48.128]  I appreciate your call, but I want to comment on what you said when you said bye.
[00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.612]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.112 --> 00:29:54.714]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.636 --> 00:29:58.299]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.712 --> 00:30:09.217]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.638 --> 00:30:13.862]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.102 --> 00:30:21.149]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:27.615]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.775 --> 00:30:28.976]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:29.637]  We're good to go.
[00:30:46.096 --> 00:30:49.220]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.300]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.360]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.521]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:50.761]  Call today.
[00:31:01.084 --> 00:31:03.045]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.145 --> 00:31:13.850]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:18.732]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.812 --> 00:31:30.158]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.738 --> 00:31:37.582]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.982 --> 00:31:40.123]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.623 --> 00:31:45.566]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:45.886 --> 00:31:56.462]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:57.504]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:03.706]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:03.926 --> 00:32:11.250]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.992]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:16.252 --> 00:32:26.077]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:26.838 --> 00:32:30.522]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:30.842 --> 00:32:33.325]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:33.345 --> 00:32:39.572]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:41.354]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:41.634 --> 00:32:42.515]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:42.595 --> 00:32:45.578]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:32:45.758 --> 00:32:46.659]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:46.699 --> 00:32:46.899]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:32:46.939 --> 00:32:50.022]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[00:32:50.042 --> 00:32:50.983]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:06.139 --> 00:33:08.046]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.548 --> 00:33:11.258]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.689 --> 00:33:20.372]  You know, the media just expects us to kind of hum through life happily about this whole high-tech police state.
[00:33:20.672 --> 00:33:34.978]  They'd like us all on Prozac, just walking along going, La la la, la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la, I love being a slave, na na na na na na na na.
[00:33:35.398 --> 00:33:36.199]  Well, I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:36.779]  What about you?
[00:33:38.712 --> 00:33:43.913]  I was doing that song during the break, and John running the show said, I dare you to do that on air.
[00:33:44.433 --> 00:33:49.294]  So there, I figured out a way to integrate acting stupid onto the show.
[00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.715]  Now I have won the big prize.
[00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:55.056]  Now, gotta have some fun, folks.
[00:33:55.136 --> 00:33:55.856]  It's Friday.
[00:33:57.836 --> 00:33:59.257]  And quite frankly, I...
[00:34:01.477 --> 00:34:04.738]  I'm getting sick and tired of the New World Order, but I'm not going to let it get me down.
[00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:12.760]  But, I mean, that listener brought up such important points and started running over him, because I want to add to this, because I've really been thinking about this a lot lately.
[00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:15.181]  Plus, we have the federal plans.
[00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:19.402]  It's about getting everybody institutionalized, everybody into the system.
[00:34:19.422 --> 00:34:25.484]  And all over the country, every couple weeks, I see a new state that passed the law, starting about a year ago with...
[00:34:26.477 --> 00:34:31.758]  The first one was Arkansas of all places, and now, I don't know, what is it, like 10, 15 other states I've seen?
[00:34:31.798 --> 00:34:32.798]  I haven't counted them all up.
[00:34:33.018 --> 00:34:33.818]  It's a whole bunch.
[00:34:35.319 --> 00:34:41.300]  And see, I mentioned it, the listener says he's up in Boston, the last caller, and he saw it this morning.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.920]  I mean, it's just, it's everywhere.
[00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:50.082]  And they announced that, well, you know, obesity is a big problem with children, and so...
[00:34:52.245 --> 00:34:54.046]  Your child's overweight.
[00:34:54.646 --> 00:34:56.548]  See, the schools are all turning medical now.
[00:34:57.008 --> 00:35:00.330]  You get your twice-a-year psychological test.
[00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:05.733]  Twice a year, we put the calipers on you and measure your weight and put that on your report card.
[00:35:05.873 --> 00:35:07.353]  It all goes on an ID card.
[00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:09.114]  Your child wears it around their neck.
[00:35:09.395 --> 00:35:10.755]  They thumb scan to get their lunch.
[00:35:10.815 --> 00:35:13.557]  Are you starting to get the idea here?
[00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:17.973]  I mean, these are like psychiatric mind-control facilities.
[00:35:17.993 --> 00:35:19.314]  That's what's being phased in.
[00:35:19.434 --> 00:35:20.475]  Fences around them.
[00:35:20.775 --> 00:35:21.956]  Police, you know, inside.
[00:35:22.216 --> 00:35:23.316]  Questioning the youth.
[00:35:24.017 --> 00:35:35.724]  BATF and hundreds of school districts in 7th or 8th grades, the grades they target, they do a semester class where it's all about law enforcement and they write papers about their family life.
[00:35:35.764 --> 00:35:37.625]  I have the documents, not just the news articles.
[00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:40.207]  That's in my film, Police Day 2, The Takeover.
[00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:50.400]  I mean, from conservative areas and liberal areas, from North Carolina to Kentucky to Texas to New York to California to Oregon.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.321]  So it's this seamless web of control.
[00:35:55.622 --> 00:36:01.345]  And look, again, there's so much I could talk about here, but I want to go to your calls, but just take this obesity thing.
[00:36:02.305 --> 00:36:04.566]  And again, some of these children look like giant toads.
[00:36:05.687 --> 00:36:07.607]  I use the French term, you know, crap-o, for it.
[00:36:07.627 --> 00:36:08.648]  That means toad in French.
[00:36:09.761 --> 00:36:10.682]  And I'm not trying to be mean.
[00:36:10.722 --> 00:36:17.165]  A lot of that is adrenal problems, hormonal problems, problems with the thyroid.
[00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:20.367]  Because of all the hormones of the food, it's screwing the kids up.
[00:36:20.847 --> 00:36:21.988]  And it's overeating as well.
[00:36:22.048 --> 00:36:26.190]  But instead of saying, you are not allowed to have vending machines.
[00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.792]  I don't care if it makes $4 billion a year for the schools.
[00:36:29.832 --> 00:36:30.912]  It's $4 billion a year, folks.
[00:36:31.332 --> 00:36:34.954]  You're not going to have Snickers and Milky Ways and Coca-Colas.
[00:36:34.994 --> 00:36:35.414]  I mean, listen.
[00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:37.155]  When I was in school, folks...
[00:36:39.761 --> 00:36:41.862]  That's all people did almost every break.
[00:36:42.822 --> 00:36:44.703]  It was eat candy bars, drink Cokes.
[00:36:44.883 --> 00:36:46.684]  I'd get Cokes, candy bars.
[00:36:46.744 --> 00:36:48.445]  Luckily, I exercised a lot so I wasn't fat.
[00:36:48.845 --> 00:36:54.127]  But still, I mean, you sit around for eight hours every day and then you go eat those school lunches.
[00:36:54.147 --> 00:36:56.028]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:36:56.708 --> 00:37:02.911]  So the school puts that stuff in there and then your children gobble it and then instead of...
[00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:10.841]  Having initiatives, which should be at the state level or city level, or neighborhood leagues, or having the parents involved.
[00:37:11.441 --> 00:37:12.722]  Where is the sound of the children?
[00:37:13.343 --> 00:37:15.104]  When I was a child, that wasn't that long ago.
[00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:28.412]  We went out and we got over from school, and we ran and played and did whatever until dark, and then we went home, and then usually we were so tired, but my dad would stand over me until I did my homework.
[00:37:30.098 --> 00:37:31.139]  You know, went to bed about 10 or 11.
[00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:34.422]  We wasn't sitting around watching television.
[00:37:35.262 --> 00:37:39.405]  Sometimes before my dad got home, you know, I'd get to watch maybe 30 minutes of cartoons.
[00:37:39.445 --> 00:37:47.532]  My mom would walk in and turn it off, and my friends would come to the door, and I'd run off and play baseball or football or go around, you know, in the woods with our BB guns.
[00:37:48.052 --> 00:37:48.893]  It was just wonderful.
[00:37:49.779 --> 00:37:55.163]  We play, you know, war and sneak around in the woods and capture the flag and all that stuff.
[00:37:55.483 --> 00:37:57.104]  You don't see that anymore, people.
[00:37:57.164 --> 00:37:58.325]  I drive all over Austin.
[00:37:58.345 --> 00:37:59.346]  I've been all over the country.
[00:37:59.366 --> 00:38:01.147]  I mean, you don't see children.
[00:38:01.668 --> 00:38:03.649]  You don't see children out.
[00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:09.613]  You see the occasional bike, somebody biking to his friend Bobby's house to play Death Commando.
[00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:11.915]  You know, you're a U.N.
[00:38:11.995 --> 00:38:14.417]  commando who kills patriots.
[00:38:14.597 --> 00:38:15.878]  He's got to go play that game.
[00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:19.773]  He's got to go play Deus Ex, or he's got to go play U.N.
[00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:22.614]  Wing Commander, or whatever.
[00:38:24.015 --> 00:38:29.818]  But don't, then, Billy, go to school and draw a picture of that, or you're going to prison.
[00:38:30.999 --> 00:38:35.801]  But on this whole obesity thing, what are they doing?
[00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:40.664]  I mean, first, in the last six, seven years, every month, there's a big headline where they show the child...
[00:38:41.354 --> 00:38:45.637]  It looks like Jabba the Hutt, and it seems reasonable that the government's gotten involved.
[00:38:45.697 --> 00:38:55.804]  Well, you know, man, that child, I mean, 300 pounds at 12 years of age, or 250 pounds at 10 years of age, I mean, something's got to be done.
[00:38:56.824 --> 00:38:58.765]  But again, road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:38:58.826 --> 00:39:00.927]  It's all done scientifically.
[00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:06.351]  Then it's, if your child's 2% over body weight, CPS will get involved.
[00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:07.952]  They don't lose the weight within six months.
[00:39:08.572 --> 00:39:10.473]  And then now the state's over your children.
[00:39:10.493 --> 00:39:14.154]  And by the way, again, let's allow all these violent video games.
[00:39:14.194 --> 00:39:15.254]  Let's sell them to the kids.
[00:39:15.754 --> 00:39:17.495]  But then if they draw a picture of it, you go to prison.
[00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:20.455]  Or let's line the halls with candy bars and Cokes.
[00:39:21.096 --> 00:39:23.576]  And then when your child gets overweight, we're going to take it from them.
[00:39:23.596 --> 00:39:25.217]  I mean, you see how they do it?
[00:39:26.457 --> 00:39:27.957]  Look, but don't touch.
[00:39:28.438 --> 00:39:29.598]  Touch, but don't taste.
[00:39:31.377 --> 00:39:32.518]  It's all set up.
[00:39:32.598 --> 00:39:33.899]  It's done by design.
[00:39:33.939 --> 00:39:34.960]  They're not stupid.
[00:39:36.661 --> 00:39:37.962]  They know what they're doing.
[00:39:38.022 --> 00:39:38.882]  It's like the drug war.
[00:39:40.323 --> 00:39:48.129]  The better the drug war gets, the more drugs we have, the more people in prisons, the more men in black ski masks stomping around, bugging their eyes out at us, always for our own good.
[00:39:48.529 --> 00:39:53.032]  And the drug-dealing families, we've traced it back, own the big private prisons predominantly.
[00:39:53.232 --> 00:39:54.413]  The drug dealers own the prisons.
[00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:55.354]  They've got a great system.
[00:39:56.054 --> 00:39:57.155]  They get it coming and going.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.142]  So this is how it starts.
[00:40:00.422 --> 00:40:10.713]  And I remember about two years ago, real big in Florida, there were cases of employees caught smoking cigarettes at parties, reported by other employees, fired.
[00:40:11.214 --> 00:40:12.395]  Because you're not allowed to smoke.
[00:40:12.435 --> 00:40:13.537]  It's a policy of this company.
[00:40:14.538 --> 00:40:16.920]  And then the cases of cops.
[00:40:17.401 --> 00:40:19.223]  One of them didn't like his lieutenant.
[00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:29.048]  Now, one of the lower-level people, they were at a cop party at a house, described how he saw the officer smoking a cigar.
[00:40:29.729 --> 00:40:30.790]  Well, he was fired.
[00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.792]  It didn't matter if he'd been on the force 20 years.
[00:40:33.392 --> 00:40:34.253]  We even interviewed him.
[00:40:35.734 --> 00:40:38.696]  And it's the policy of the department that you're not allowed to smoke.
[00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:40.738]  No tobacco products.
[00:40:40.998 --> 00:40:41.919]  You're fired.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.703]  Floor is where we see most of these, but now the caller's mentioned, yes, it's all over the country.
[00:40:47.841 --> 00:40:58.247]  And then they say, and I've heard the so-called neocons on talk radio the last few days going, well, you know, it's a private company, and policy's policy, but see, the companies are now bigger than government.
[00:40:59.087 --> 00:41:07.792]  And see, you're going to have to work for one of these big companies, and see, first it's cigarettes, then it's, oh, we've got to do a blood or urine test, which they were demanding of the employees, and they said no.
[00:41:08.763 --> 00:41:15.830]  I'll let you drug test me for drugs, you know, cocaine, marijuana, whatever, but you are not going to test me for nicotine.
[00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.693]  So they said to the four employees, fine, you're fired.
[00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:19.974]  No smoking.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.840]  And then now they're trying to pass laws.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.261]  They've passed some in the country.
[00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:26.101]  No smoking outside.
[00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:27.842]  No smoking in your own house.
[00:41:28.202 --> 00:41:29.062]  They have other laws.
[00:41:29.402 --> 00:41:31.263]  No religious services at your home.
[00:41:31.723 --> 00:41:40.485]  And so the Baptists have five people over, or the rabbi has four people over, and the police actually come the second time and arrest the rabbi.
[00:41:40.785 --> 00:41:43.666]  Come and arrest the Baptist meeting.
[00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:52.766]  But, meanwhile, it's okay if the neighbors next door have a bachelor party with ten topless dancers swinging from the chandeliers.
[00:41:54.668 --> 00:41:56.470]  All of this is about control.
[00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.411]  This is not what America is.
[00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:00.974]  And none of it has anything to do with stopping Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:01.794 --> 00:42:07.500]  And so now, Health and Human Services Secretary, about what, two years ago, they put out the report.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.183]  The Agriculture Department put out a report a few years ago as well, saying...
[00:42:11.932 --> 00:42:14.174]  We're going to have an actual ID card for the driver's license.
[00:42:14.194 --> 00:42:14.895]  You're going to scan it.
[00:42:14.915 --> 00:42:15.976]  There's going to be a sales tax.
[00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:16.837]  That's already being announced.
[00:42:17.697 --> 00:42:21.040]  And while you do this, everything you buy will be tracked.
[00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:27.767]  And you'll be allowed a certain amount of beer, a certain amount of Blue Bell ice cream, a certain amount of fattening things, a certain amount of T-bones.
[00:42:28.187 --> 00:42:32.691]  But over that point, it's going to be flagged, and it's going to go to the police department.
[00:42:33.392 --> 00:42:34.953]  And it's going to go to the insurance company.
[00:42:34.973 --> 00:42:35.634]  This is admitted.
[00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:41.658]  And I'm sure you've heard the report of the guy who goes into the doctor and says, Doctor, I'm having some heart palpitations.
[00:42:41.678 --> 00:42:42.778]  And the doctor, well, do you drink?
[00:42:43.178 --> 00:42:44.678]  Well, yeah, I'm 46 years old.
[00:42:44.718 --> 00:42:48.899]  And a lot of nights I get home after work, I don't drink and drive, but I drink a six-pack.
[00:42:49.519 --> 00:42:52.080]  And the doctor said, well, I'm revoking your driver's license.
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.080]  No judge, no jury.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.561]  But you say you don't drink while you drive, but still, I just think you might be.
[00:42:57.621 --> 00:42:59.561]  And so we're revoking your license.
[00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:03.822]  And the guy went to court and they said, yes, it doesn't matter if you don't drink and drive.
[00:43:05.062 --> 00:43:06.322]  You say you drink a six-pack and
[00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:10.233]  Well, the doctor says you don't think you should be able to have a license because of that.
[00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:11.434]  Okay, you don't have it.
[00:43:12.955 --> 00:43:15.796]  See, folks, are you starting to get what I'm talking about here?
[00:43:16.277 --> 00:43:17.858]  And I'm not joking about this.
[00:43:18.818 --> 00:43:21.480]  Your children are in these schools.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.761]  This is the model of the future.
[00:43:22.781 --> 00:43:32.447]  It doesn't matter if the valedictorian, a young lady, valedictorian, last day of school, she brought cake and cookies.
[00:43:33.826 --> 00:43:41.050]  And she was going to put on a little party with her little speech club in one of the classrooms after school.
[00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.631]  Just a little hour-long party to say bye to friends.
[00:43:44.672 --> 00:43:47.413]  Well, the security guard we interviewed about three years ago.
[00:43:48.174 --> 00:43:51.315]  The security guard saw the Dixie box.
[00:43:52.176 --> 00:43:53.897]  You know the Dixie box I'm talking about.
[00:43:53.917 --> 00:43:57.078]  It has a little area with spoons and fork and knife.
[00:43:57.218 --> 00:44:00.400]  You know the little box that has ten of each.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.081]  He saw the paper plates and
[00:44:02.737 --> 00:44:04.298]  He saw the plastic knives.
[00:44:05.299 --> 00:44:06.120]  She was arrested.
[00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:15.527]  And she was not allowed to graduate, and they stripped her, and she went to court, and later did get her GED.
[00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:19.370]  But no valent Victorian for you.
[00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.611]  We're stripping it from you.
[00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:23.693]  We have a zero-tolerance policy.
[00:44:25.296 --> 00:44:28.938]  We must be as mindless as possible and persecute everyone, to be fair.
[00:44:29.058 --> 00:44:31.420]  Why, you saw what happened to Columbine.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.041]  You know, we saw your federal operation.
[00:44:34.521 --> 00:44:35.162]  Type that in.
[00:44:35.182 --> 00:44:41.585]  Type in, Vala Victorian loses diploma over plastic knife.
[00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:50.991]  She had the little paper, the little paper, tablecloth, the cake, the cookies, the soda pop.
[00:44:52.152 --> 00:44:54.133]  And she had the Dixie Box.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.881]  And even the Dixie Cups.
[00:44:58.101 --> 00:44:58.981]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[00:44:59.021 --> 00:45:02.622]  I mean, I just had like a hundred other examples of this flood through my mind.
[00:45:03.002 --> 00:45:04.323]  Remember the homeschooler?
[00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:21.408]  The homeschooler, 15, graduated from high school, top of her class in New York City, highest test score in New York City, 15 years old.
[00:45:24.617 --> 00:45:26.400]  Scholarship at the college.
[00:45:26.721 --> 00:45:27.662]  Everything ahead of her.
[00:45:27.963 --> 00:45:29.545]  Had all these friends, you name it.
[00:45:30.186 --> 00:45:34.353]  They came, and they told the father, where is your daughter?
[00:45:34.433 --> 00:45:35.435]  He said, she is at school.
[00:45:35.475 --> 00:45:37.198]  And they said, we're taking her from you.
[00:45:38.129 --> 00:45:41.011]  And last time I interviewed her and the father, she was in hiding.
[00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:41.551]  I don't remember.
[00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:42.472]  It was in the New York Post.
[00:45:42.972 --> 00:45:43.673]  She was in hiding.
[00:45:43.693 --> 00:45:44.653]  They were seeking her.
[00:45:45.254 --> 00:45:45.914]  Seeking her.
[00:45:46.235 --> 00:45:51.098]  They'd already kicked her out of college, told the dean, you're not allowed to have her.
[00:45:51.138 --> 00:45:54.860]  We're revoking her diploma, even though she passed the test after this.
[00:45:55.281 --> 00:46:03.206]  And then we're seeking to take her because the father abused her by not letting her have the enjoyment of high school and her peers.
[00:46:03.926 --> 00:46:04.487]  Don't believe me?
[00:46:05.566 --> 00:46:08.729]  Just type in 15-year-old homeschooler sought by police.
[00:46:09.729 --> 00:46:11.030]  That was last year.
[00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:14.293]  And again, dozens of examples just flooded my mind.
[00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:18.556]  These aren't... Another New York case.
[00:46:18.636 --> 00:46:23.740]  Man gives 10%, not 20%, arrested, charged with felony robbery.
[00:46:25.261 --> 00:46:25.602]  Yes.
[00:46:26.402 --> 00:46:29.224]  Or man talking on cell phone arrested.
[00:46:29.845 --> 00:46:33.448]  Or woman talking on cell phone tackled arrested.
[00:46:33.548 --> 00:46:34.909]  Or man put...
[00:46:35.558 --> 00:46:37.219]  Leg up on bench, arrested.
[00:46:37.819 --> 00:46:43.962]  Or woman walked down to the subway platform and the officer said, you can't eat that on the subway.
[00:46:43.982 --> 00:46:47.263]  She said, okay, and popped the last piece of Butterfinger into her mouth.
[00:46:47.763 --> 00:46:55.206]  He arrested her and said, disorderly conduct, disregarding the order of a police officer, resisting without violence.
[00:46:55.746 --> 00:47:01.549]  And the officer told the news, I did it because she was disrespectful the way she chewed.
[00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:09.531]  She aggressively popped it in her mouth with pleasure and chewed it arrogantly.
[00:47:10.852 --> 00:47:14.713]  And we don't put up with that in America now!
[00:47:15.193 --> 00:47:16.593]  Are you with Al-Qaeda?
[00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:19.454]  And you don't chew aggressively!
[00:47:20.014 --> 00:47:22.975]  And you don't look at the president in the eyes or you're arrested!
[00:47:23.436 --> 00:47:25.336]  And you don't bring a cross to a demonstration!
[00:47:26.497 --> 00:47:27.897]  This is the new freedom, people!
[00:47:28.777 --> 00:47:32.558]  And you don't sell knock-off Rubik's Cubes or Homeland Security, he'll hit you, hit you hard!
[00:47:33.018 --> 00:47:36.019]  And you don't complain to the VA too much.
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.081]  They'll admit that he didn't threaten anybody, but had to be arrested as a terrorist.
[00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:42.422]  Because complaining is terrorism.
[00:47:42.822 --> 00:47:47.803]  Because it holds up the government, and by holding up the government, that helps Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:49.264 --> 00:47:50.024]  That's what they said.
[00:47:50.764 --> 00:47:52.305]  Everything helps Al-Qaeda now.
[00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:54.426]  We're all servants of Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:54.646 --> 00:47:58.247]  And the government's doing its best to hold back the flood against all of us.
[00:47:59.116 --> 00:48:01.037]  Let's talk to Alex in the Carolinas.
[00:48:01.117 --> 00:48:01.897]  Alex, go ahead.
[00:48:01.917 --> 00:48:03.578]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:48:03.598 --> 00:48:04.178]  I appreciate it.
[00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:04.919]  You bet, sir.
[00:48:05.539 --> 00:48:07.120]  And I appreciate the show very much.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.441]  I have a comment and two questions.
[00:48:10.521 --> 00:48:18.545]  The first thing is that I just found out that on May 12th in Raleigh, North Carolina, we'll be having our very own FEMA disaster drill.
[00:48:19.486 --> 00:48:20.446]  I think that's really interesting.
[00:48:20.466 --> 00:48:21.286]  Well, call it what it is.
[00:48:22.547 --> 00:48:26.609]  Federalization, relinquishment of local control, slave drill.
[00:48:27.253 --> 00:48:29.614]  Well, you know, right there on their site, what do they call it?
[00:48:29.634 --> 00:48:30.855]  They use a very funny phrase.
[00:48:31.355 --> 00:48:35.197]  It says, CERT is a national service program of the U.S.
[00:48:35.497 --> 00:48:36.498]  Freedom Corps.
[00:48:37.358 --> 00:48:46.423]  Like peace crime or, you know, like the way I should probably full stop the duck speak speedwise.
[00:48:46.983 --> 00:48:48.084]  It sounds like newspeak to me.
[00:48:48.284 --> 00:48:49.844]  Double quack, double plus good.
[00:48:50.165 --> 00:48:50.565]  Exactly.
[00:48:50.585 --> 00:48:52.626]  So you know the 11th edition.
[00:48:52.666 --> 00:48:52.886]  Good.
[00:48:54.426 --> 00:48:55.567]  You may know too much, though.
[00:48:55.948 --> 00:48:56.829]  I probably do.
[00:48:57.409 --> 00:48:58.730]  I'm a terrorist already, I'm sure.
[00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.534]  But I do hope to go to this drill, and I do hope to videotape it.
[00:49:02.554 --> 00:49:04.396]  They also are asking for people to participate.
[00:49:04.436 --> 00:49:08.921]  I don't know if I really feel comfortable about that, because who knows what they're actually going to do to you.
[00:49:08.961 --> 00:49:11.183]  They say that you're going to have to be...
[00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:15.121]  You know, pretend some sort of nuclear or biological attack.
[00:49:15.141 --> 00:49:17.062]  Yeah, they're going to splatter fake blood on you.
[00:49:17.382 --> 00:49:25.547]  They'll probably have a bunch of school kids there, because, you know, they order them out of the class, and there'll be men screaming with machine guns, and they'll probably blow up some old cars in the town.
[00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:27.428]  So that's May 12th.
[00:49:27.928 --> 00:49:32.411]  The questions I have, though, concern the right to keep and bear arms, although I guess these days that's the privilege.
[00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:37.574]  Well, according to, it's in his heart, Alberto Gonzalez wants to ban your guns.
[00:49:37.814 --> 00:49:38.174]  Exactly.
[00:49:38.234 --> 00:49:39.135]  It's heartfelt.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:46.264]  But seriously, the first question I have, is it really worthwhile anymore to obtain a concealed carry permit?
[00:49:46.464 --> 00:49:47.184]  I'd like to do it.
[00:49:47.224 --> 00:49:49.966]  I'd like to be able to transport my firearms without harassment.
[00:49:50.026 --> 00:49:53.708]  But on the other hand, I'm worried I'm just going in the gun grabber database.
[00:49:53.728 --> 00:49:54.408]  What are your opinions?
[00:49:54.488 --> 00:49:56.990]  Well, you are, and it turns the right into a privilege.
[00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:03.253]  And, you know, in Texas, you don't need a permit to carry a loaded shotgun or rifle.
[00:50:04.314 --> 00:50:09.257]  And that's why the few times, you know, stalkers have been particularly bad and threatening me, well, I just put a shotgun in the back seat.
[00:50:10.212 --> 00:50:11.193]  But I haven't done that in years.
[00:50:11.273 --> 00:50:12.595]  I'm not too worried about myself.
[00:50:12.655 --> 00:50:14.637]  If they strike me down, that's just the way it goes.
[00:50:15.218 --> 00:50:18.601]  That's all God's will.
[00:50:21.524 --> 00:50:22.245]  That's what they've done.
[00:50:22.545 --> 00:50:23.887]  They turn a right into a privilege.
[00:50:23.927 --> 00:50:26.990]  A license is authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.731]  So the government tells us it's illegal to travel unless the king gives you permission.
[00:50:30.751 --> 00:50:32.932]  It's illegal to have a gun unless we give you permission.
[00:50:33.672 --> 00:50:34.692]  It's a special license.
[00:50:34.792 --> 00:50:36.253]  And, you know, it's a stopgap measure.
[00:50:36.813 --> 00:50:40.714]  What we need is Vermont-style carrying, which just says, hey, you've got a right to carry guns.
[00:50:41.514 --> 00:50:42.074]  End of story.
[00:50:42.455 --> 00:50:43.055]  Second Amendment.
[00:50:43.995 --> 00:50:45.115]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[00:50:45.656 --> 00:50:46.316]  Yeah, one other thing.
[00:50:46.356 --> 00:50:48.877]  Have you seen the PSN.gov billboards?
[00:50:49.377 --> 00:50:52.098]  Felons using guns do hard times.
[00:50:52.138 --> 00:50:52.758]  Yes, stay there.
[00:50:52.818 --> 00:50:54.198]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:50:55.379 --> 00:50:56.179]  Good points there.
[00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:05.748]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.928 --> 00:51:10.351]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:14.854]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.914 --> 00:51:16.275]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:22.281]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:29.269]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:31.412]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.752 --> 00:51:42.216]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.376 --> 00:51:47.798]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:04.936]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.156 --> 00:52:10.598]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:21.243]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.403 --> 00:52:25.745]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.925 --> 00:52:34.289]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:40.893]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:41.273]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:54:05.434 --> 00:54:05.814]  All right.
[00:54:05.914 --> 00:54:09.457]  In the next hour, we're going to go back to your calls right now, but in the next hour I'll really attempt to...
[00:54:10.749 --> 00:54:11.869]  Get to everybody quickly here.
[00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:14.830]  I just get an idea of my frustration.
[00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:28.293]  I mean, I've just got legions of examples of the most Orwellian-type control, and that's what Alex in the Carolinas was getting into, you know, quack speak and double plus good, the 11th version of Ingsoc.
[00:54:29.674 --> 00:54:33.435]  You've got to read 1984 to follow along with this, but I mean, really, they're implementing.
[00:54:33.975 --> 00:54:36.915]  They're restricting the language, changing the meaning of words.
[00:54:38.616 --> 00:54:39.536]  Just, it's amazing.
[00:54:40.916 --> 00:54:42.097]  It's like Bush's speech.
[00:54:42.117 --> 00:54:43.818]  I mean, that was right out of 1984.
[00:54:44.718 --> 00:54:48.660]  Liberty, liberty, freedom, freedom, fighting tyranny, fighting tyranny, fighting outposts of tyranny.
[00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.662]  It's the opposite of what that puppet's actually doing.
[00:54:52.362 --> 00:54:53.083]  But, Alex...
[00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:56.328]  You just brought up a point before the break.
[00:54:56.568 --> 00:54:57.269]  What was the rest of it?
[00:54:57.709 --> 00:55:01.950]  The PSN.gov billboards that say, I think it says, felons with guns do crime.
[00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.590]  It's one of these things.
[00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.310]  Well, what they do is, let me, I mean, I've seen these.
[00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.391]  They're on buses in Austin.
[00:55:05.411 --> 00:55:06.231]  They're all over the country.
[00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:07.651]  I've seen pictures of them all over the country.
[00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:09.152]  I've driven around the nation and seen them.
[00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:10.612]  This has been going on for a decade.
[00:55:11.032 --> 00:55:13.673]  It says, report illegal guns.
[00:55:13.693 --> 00:55:15.213]  And there's a big revolver.
[00:55:15.894 --> 00:55:24.840]  And then in small print that you've got to stand under the billboard to read, can't see from the road, or get right up against the bus to read, it says, felons beware, it's illegal for you to have a gun.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.843]  But see, the general public sees just a revolver and thinks, report illegal guns, those revolvers are illegal.
[00:55:31.724 --> 00:55:37.888]  And so then when they're in your house or whatever and see a revolver and a case on the wall, they go call the police.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:40.260]  Yep.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.503]  I mean, it's one of these things that it's just too obvious for that to be the purpose.
[00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:47.445]  I mean, why else would they put a handgun with a big extra in it?
[00:55:47.485 --> 00:55:50.367]  Why not show off someone who looks like a criminal with a gun?
[00:55:50.407 --> 00:55:55.371]  I mean, what they're trying to do, obviously, is to make you associate, you know, gun equals crime.
[00:55:56.412 --> 00:55:58.213]  Well, gun equals you're going to jail.
[00:55:59.068 --> 00:56:03.334]  And then see most of the TV shows are set in New York or Chicago or L.A.
[00:56:03.354 --> 00:56:06.178]  where you basically have semi-gun bans or total gun bans.
[00:56:06.598 --> 00:56:10.564]  And so people see the simulated cop go over and go, He's got a gun!
[00:56:10.584 --> 00:56:11.265]  Get down on the ground!
[00:56:11.285 --> 00:56:12.947]  You're going to jail for 20 years for this!
[00:56:13.187 --> 00:56:15.110]  People watch that and think guns are illegal.
[00:56:15.945 --> 00:56:38.321]  So, in the majority of the country where they're still completely legal, where the Second Amendment's still alive somewhat, again, somebody moves to your state from New York City, and they're a carpet cleaner, this happened to me, and they come to your house and clean your carpets, and they see a shotgun in a case, and they go and almost try to call the police on me until their bosses told them, no, we were allowed to have guns in Texas.
[00:56:39.804 --> 00:56:41.125]  I mean, that's how crazy this is.
[00:56:41.165 --> 00:56:42.647]  This is the mind control, people.
[00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:47.011]  And George Bush has radically expanded the, quote, gun education funding.
[00:56:47.872 --> 00:56:49.293]  And these things are going up everywhere.
[00:56:50.995 --> 00:56:52.096]  Good points, Alex.
[00:56:52.116 --> 00:56:52.777]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:55.059 --> 00:57:01.165]  Before we go back to Robert and Tim and Preston and Chris and...
[00:57:03.193 --> 00:57:16.880]  William and everybody else that is patiently holding, just briefly here at the end of the hour, little salvo out there in the InfoWar, you believe in what I'm doing and you want to join me in the fight against the New World Order and you want to expose all this, my films do it.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.221]  Take Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:23.043]  About three minutes of the film is the thumb scanners going in the grocery stores.
[00:57:23.903 --> 00:57:25.824]  That's just an idea of what you get in the film.
[00:57:26.807 --> 00:57:28.228]  You know, where we go and we confront them about it.
[00:57:28.488 --> 00:57:30.169]  And then show them lying on a local newscast.
[00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:33.391]  That's three minutes of the two-hour, 44-minute film.
[00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:35.352]  Really, it's three or four films in one.
[00:57:35.492 --> 00:57:37.754]  That's one film, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[00:57:38.034 --> 00:57:39.655]  Road to Tyranny is three or four films in one.
[00:57:40.835 --> 00:57:46.058]  It's almost three hours long on DVD, two and a half hours long on VHS.
[00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:49.060]  Right now, it's $5.95 when you buy one copy at the regular price.

[00:58:44.769 --> 00:58:46.589]  You should be pulling your hair out and freaking out.
[00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.949]  This is out of control.
[00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:51.851]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.712 --> 00:58:58.372]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.033 --> 00:58:59.993]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.792 --> 00:59:01.872]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.553 --> 00:59:03.393]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.133 --> 00:59:05.073]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.093 --> 00:59:09.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:14.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.176 --> 00:59:21.218]  Alright, coming up in 30 minutes, we have an expert on chimeras, cross-species cloning.
[00:59:21.898 --> 00:59:22.938]  Believe me, you don't want to miss it.
[00:59:23.058 --> 00:59:26.359]  Tons of police state news, Iraq news, fake election news in Iraq.
[00:59:27.319 --> 00:59:28.260]  Just so much coming up.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.140]  But let's get through your
[00:59:30.023 --> 00:59:30.523]  Calls.
[00:59:31.103 --> 00:59:39.006]  Let's talk right now to Robert, then Tim, Preston, Chris, Deagle, Ron, and others.
[00:59:39.406 --> 00:59:39.946]  Go ahead.
[00:59:39.966 --> 00:59:42.467]  You're on the air, Robert.
[00:59:43.367 --> 00:59:45.008]  Good morning, Alexander.
[00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.588]  You troublemaking radio talk show host, you.
[00:59:48.989 --> 00:59:50.149]  Well, yes.
[00:59:50.249 --> 00:59:50.909]  I'm very bad.
[00:59:50.929 --> 00:59:56.871]  I enjoyed your interview yesterday with Colonel Kashinoff.
[00:59:56.891 --> 00:59:57.411]  Is that his name?
[00:59:58.732 --> 00:59:58.972]  Yes.
[00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:04.254]  Yeah, I laughed myself silly when you said, is it true that U.S.
[01:00:04.295 --> 01:00:07.037]  congressmen are being bribed by the Russians?
[01:00:07.117 --> 01:00:09.800]  And he said, well, if that's true, I feel sorry for the congressmen.
[01:00:10.901 --> 01:00:13.404]  I was actually talking about Israelis, yeah.
[01:00:13.504 --> 01:00:13.884]  Exactly.
[01:00:13.904 --> 01:00:17.107]  I don't know, it just went blank.
[01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:17.988]  I had something to say.
[01:00:18.509 --> 01:00:19.309]  I know how that is.
[01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:21.752]  Yeah, yeah, give me a second so it won't pop into my head.
[01:00:22.279 --> 01:00:26.741]  As you know, Richard Scrucia of HealthSouth is on trial now for a financial misstatement.
[01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:32.444]  Same with Bernie Evers, WorldCom, MCI, and the guy from Tyco, Kozlowski.
[01:00:32.564 --> 01:00:34.604]  But that's all just low-level stuff.
[01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:35.425]  I was wrong.
[01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.885]  It's not a trillion two missing.
[01:00:37.246 --> 01:00:44.389]  CBS News now reporting, we reposted this yesterday, that 2.4 trillion is missing from the Pentagon.
[01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:45.049]  Yeah.
[01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:49.171]  So you think that's just happenstance that all three of them are on trial at the same time?
[01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:51.212]  Well, I mean, it's to make you think they're...
[01:00:52.512 --> 01:00:54.513]  We're talking about hundreds of millions with these guys.
[01:00:54.913 --> 01:00:55.074]  Yeah.
[01:00:55.294 --> 01:00:56.274]  Compared to trillions.
[01:00:56.815 --> 01:00:56.975]  Yeah.
[01:00:57.695 --> 01:01:02.358]  So trillions is being stolen, and then they're burning some just low-level people.
[01:01:02.418 --> 01:01:04.559]  I mean, hundreds of millions compared to trillions is nothing.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.681]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:01:06.801 --> 01:01:14.305]  It's meant to create... People didn't have confidence in the stock market, so it's meant to create confidence that we're cleaning it up, we're fixing it.
[01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:17.187]  Meanwhile, they're raiding our pension funds systematically.
[01:01:17.747 --> 01:01:22.070]  Yeah, two years after Bush changed the pension fund rules where we don't own our own pension funds.
[01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:23.531]  Good point, good point.
[01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:29.373]  They changed the pension fund rules, and then every time they steal them line, they go, it was just an accident.
[01:01:31.434 --> 01:01:36.796]  I look forward enthusiastically to tonight when you and George Norrie hook up on the radio.
[01:01:36.816 --> 01:01:41.017]  I'm going to plug in my boom box to the back of my sound card and just record it.
[01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:42.658]  It's like, let's do it this weekend.
[01:01:43.038 --> 01:01:44.338]  I think that'll be really good, you and him.
[01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:46.659]  We'll be here together in studio, no less.
[01:01:46.939 --> 01:01:48.340]  Yeah, I look forward to it.
[01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:50.970]  Yeah, be sure and talk it up, Alex.
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:52.671]  Let people know, because that's going to be a big deal.
[01:01:53.611 --> 01:01:56.471]  Well, I mean, I've been on a bunch before, but it's always fun.
[01:01:56.891 --> 01:01:58.672]  Are you going to be on all four hours?
[01:01:58.692 --> 01:01:58.992]  Do you know?
[01:01:59.312 --> 01:02:02.772]  You know, I was supposed to call them yesterday, but by the time I called, the producer was out.
[01:02:03.092 --> 01:02:04.893]  But I'm either on three hours or four hours.
[01:02:05.113 --> 01:02:05.453]  I don't know.
[01:02:06.913 --> 01:02:08.353]  In for a penny, in for a pound.
[01:02:08.913 --> 01:02:09.654]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:11.094]  Okay, man, thanks for your time.
[01:02:11.114 --> 01:02:11.774]  Keep up the good work.
[01:02:11.814 --> 01:02:12.094]  God bless.
[01:02:12.374 --> 01:02:13.674]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:15.755]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:02:15.795 --> 01:02:16.635]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:17.095]  Go ahead.
[01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:20.198]  Hello, Tim.
[01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:22.039]  You're on the air.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.000]  My friend.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.361]  Now you're gone.
[01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:27.802]  Let's talk to Preston in Washington.
[01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:28.643]  Go ahead, Preston.
[01:02:29.463 --> 01:02:38.769]  Yeah, I noticed those thumb and retina scanners at customs last time I went out of the country, and I asked the guy if they're going to be implemented, and he says, oh, no, not yet.
[01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:40.170]  That's just for future use.
[01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.632]  He says, we really don't do that right now.
[01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:44.329]  Oh, really?
[01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:49.712]  They just signed the regulations a month ago to do it and just passed the National ID card.
[01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:54.375]  That was as recently as October of last year, I had asked him, because that's when I went through customs.
[01:02:55.256 --> 01:03:02.160]  And he said, nonchalantly, he's like, well, you know, I said, do you think that's a good idea?
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.163]  He says, he kind of leaned over and looked around and he says, personally, I don't like it.
[01:03:06.676 --> 01:03:08.237]  Well, it's like the Roach Motel.
[01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:09.597]  Roaches can get in.
[01:03:09.637 --> 01:03:10.417]  They can't get out.
[01:03:10.777 --> 01:03:11.017]  Yeah.
[01:03:11.498 --> 01:03:13.338]  All this stuff is for getting out of the country.
[01:03:13.638 --> 01:03:14.678]  That's where the security is.
[01:03:15.279 --> 01:03:15.659]  Right.
[01:03:15.679 --> 01:03:18.520]  Well, and this was also coming back in.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.921]  This was coming back into the state, too, that I saw.
[01:03:21.981 --> 01:03:25.082]  I'm aware of that, but they engage in acing.
[01:03:25.662 --> 01:03:30.383]  They have a rule, federal rule, where they just disregard it and turn them off coming in.
[01:03:31.184 --> 01:03:33.144]  But it's 100% going to be implemented going out.
[01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:35.585]  Wow, because going out, I didn't have to do it.
[01:03:36.429 --> 01:03:37.371]  It's called A-Sing.
[01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.052]  Not yet.
[01:03:38.372 --> 01:03:42.840]  And A-Sing is where... A-Sing is mainly used for Muslim countries.
[01:03:43.661 --> 01:03:44.863]  This is in the Miami Herald.
[01:03:44.883 --> 01:03:45.604]  They have a rule.
[01:03:46.806 --> 01:03:47.787]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[01:03:47.847 --> 01:03:48.228]  Stay there.
[01:03:48.268 --> 01:03:49.871]  We'll tell you about A-Sing when we return.
[01:03:53.977 --> 01:04:01.381]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:06.363]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:12.226]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.486 --> 01:04:17.008]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:24.371]  Attached was society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.391 --> 01:04:28.933]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.093 --> 01:04:31.614]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:38.197]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional reform.
[01:04:38.337 --> 01:04:38.658]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.001 --> 01:05:03.725]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:11.508]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:07:00.874 --> 01:07:01.975]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.635 --> 01:07:03.476]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.216 --> 01:07:05.137]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.597 --> 01:07:09.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.083]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.265 --> 01:07:18.626]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:25.110]  We're eight minutes and thirty seconds into the second hour of this live Friday edition.
[01:07:26.118 --> 01:07:27.799]  We're getting some of your great calls out of the way.
[01:07:27.819 --> 01:07:28.699]  They've been holding patiently.
[01:07:28.719 --> 01:07:30.119]  Then I'm going to plunge back into the news.
[01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:32.400]  We'll be talking about cloning with a cloning expert.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.802]  Some of the monstrosities of the island of Dr. Maru that are actually manifesting themselves.
[01:07:38.603 --> 01:07:44.145]  But right now, I believe we were talking to Preston in Washington State.
[01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:46.545]  And Preston, you were bringing up an important point.
[01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:48.646]  Recap that for the folks that just joined us.
[01:07:49.106 --> 01:07:49.687]  Oh, it's just the...
[01:07:51.533 --> 01:07:55.836]  Some scanners and the retina scanners get customs when you're entering and leaving the country.
[01:07:56.296 --> 01:07:57.717]  And I was talking about acing.
[01:07:57.958 --> 01:07:58.178]  Right.
[01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:09.225]  Acing is a process where people come in from foreign countries and they'll just selectively sometimes check everybody's papers.
[01:08:09.245 --> 01:08:15.390]  But when they do acing, everybody just walks through showing their papers, holding them up, and no one is looked at.
[01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.933]  It's the same thing that was in the Homeland Security bill.
[01:08:21.028 --> 01:08:30.236]  The National Intelligence Act, the 9-1-1 bill, as it was called, had three different names, that was passed a month and a half ago that gave us the national ID card and other goodies.
[01:08:32.278 --> 01:08:46.290]  Inside there, it says illegal aliens were going to accept all their ID cards from their countries that anybody can get, and banks and states are supposed to accept them, but citizens then have to show all these other forms of ID.
[01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:49.673]  So it actually gave partial amnesty to the illegal aliens.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:57.206]  Well, what amazed me was when I went through, I had my passport and everything ready, and they said, you need to see this.
[01:08:58.226 --> 01:08:59.847]  And he thought it was issued by the United States.
[01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:02.510]  He waved because he doesn't know I don't need to see that.
[01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:05.212]  And I said, don't you need to stamp it for entry back into the country?
[01:09:05.232 --> 01:09:06.633]  He goes, no, go right ahead.
[01:09:07.473 --> 01:09:08.594]  Which I found very unusual.
[01:09:09.655 --> 01:09:12.297]  Didn't even look at my passport to get back into the United States.
[01:09:13.698 --> 01:09:15.039]  He just asked me where I was coming from.
[01:09:15.079 --> 01:09:16.600]  Yeah, no, you were aced.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:16.820]  Okay.
[01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:21.210]  It's called acing and they're not supposed to do it.
[01:09:22.071 --> 01:09:26.413]  It's actually a written rule that they're allowed to, but the other rules say they're not supposed to.
[01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:27.354]  That's the thing.
[01:09:27.414 --> 01:09:33.217]  The government's got different rules and laws for a hundred different occasions.
[01:09:33.257 --> 01:09:34.058]  It's called tyranny.
[01:09:34.098 --> 01:09:34.658]  Thanks for the call.
[01:09:34.878 --> 01:09:35.179]  Thank you.
[01:09:35.299 --> 01:09:36.139]  Good to hear from you.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.840]  Let's talk to Chris.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.141]  Chris, where are you calling us from?
[01:09:39.161 --> 01:09:40.302]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:40.322 --> 01:09:40.722]  How are you?
[01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:42.213]  Good.
[01:09:42.233 --> 01:09:43.454]  You're calling from New Mexico?
[01:09:43.634 --> 01:09:44.535]  Yes, I sure am.
[01:09:44.695 --> 01:09:44.915]  All right.
[01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:45.796]  Good to have you on board.
[01:09:45.836 --> 01:09:46.356]  What's going on?
[01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:47.057]  Thank you, sir.
[01:09:47.117 --> 01:09:50.620]  Well, I've got a little cherry here to add to the cake of your day.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:59.947]  On our local news here, at 10 minutes into the hour, they run a little 60-second thing from Dr. Phil.
[01:10:00.487 --> 01:10:02.949]  You know, the tip of the day from Dr. Phil.
[01:10:03.009 --> 01:10:06.131]  And here's what he said, and I quote from last Tuesday's show.
[01:10:06.872 --> 01:10:09.834]  Being a parent is a privilege, not a right.
[01:10:12.142 --> 01:10:15.877]  So, okay, so we can't even have kids anymore, you know?
[01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:19.234]  Well, Dr. Phil knows best.
[01:10:19.294 --> 01:10:22.035]  Yeah, and all of America heard this, of course.
[01:10:22.095 --> 01:10:23.675]  So, you know, I mean, geez.
[01:10:24.435 --> 01:10:25.135]  And that's what they do.
[01:10:25.195 --> 01:10:32.737]  For years, they give good advice, act nice, act real friendly, smile at you, look into the camera sincerely, wear the nice fancy suits.
[01:10:33.258 --> 01:10:34.538]  Just your fatherly figure.
[01:10:34.578 --> 01:10:38.719]  And then, overnight, ban SUVs, arrest people.
[01:10:38.759 --> 01:10:39.699]  You know, it's like O'Reilly.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.020]  They just shift gears into this neocon mode.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.781]  And I didn't hear that, but...
[01:10:46.724 --> 01:10:49.425]  Again, a privilege is something authorized by the state.
[01:10:49.825 --> 01:10:50.305]  Absolutely.
[01:10:50.405 --> 01:10:52.265]  And so, again, the state is really the parent.
[01:10:52.305 --> 01:10:55.246]  I've seen the documents where the schools say, we're really the parents.
[01:10:55.306 --> 01:10:57.066]  We have more rights than the parents.
[01:10:57.086 --> 01:11:00.527]  Of course, it's all a fraud, but they're now trying to claim this, folks.
[01:11:01.147 --> 01:11:04.528]  And so I guess Dr. Philbin's going to have something special about grabbing people's kids or something.
[01:11:04.648 --> 01:11:05.328]  Yeah, probably.
[01:11:05.368 --> 01:11:06.808]  Listen, I do have a question.
[01:11:07.548 --> 01:11:12.789]  I listen to a lot of AM broadcasts, and I've been hearing something a little strange lately.
[01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.030]  First of all, who is this Ad Council?
[01:11:15.734 --> 01:11:24.018]  Because all of this stuff that relates to state things and Homeland Security and all this stuff, brought to you by the Ad Council.
[01:11:24.038 --> 01:11:25.359]  Who are these people, number one?
[01:11:26.039 --> 01:11:32.303]  And the other part of that is it seems like they've had a change of names or a shift in names.
[01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:36.905]  First it was Homeland Security, and now I've noticed they're saying Homeland Defense.
[01:11:38.018 --> 01:11:38.798]  What's that all about?
[01:11:39.159 --> 01:11:41.280]  Well, Homeland Defense is one of the missions.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.322]  The real mission is infrastructure protection of Homeland Security.
[01:11:45.362 --> 01:11:50.245]  I'm actually trying to dig out an article, two articles I have about the Ad Council.
[01:11:50.565 --> 01:11:58.530]  They've been caught being involved, being part of the mechanism for doling out cash to people to put out the government propaganda line.
[01:11:59.231 --> 01:12:01.732]  The whole Armstrong-Williams type thing.
[01:12:01.992 --> 01:12:05.214]  Yeah, and who was that other gal that was just exposed the other night?
[01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.295]  Yeah, a whole bunch of them, but...
[01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:13.350]  What's happened here is, and what goes on, is I actually had the head of the Ad Council on a few years ago.
[01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.893]  Because they were running anti-gun ads.
[01:12:17.873 --> 01:12:20.415]  And as part of the Ad Council was McGruff the Crime Dog.
[01:12:20.455 --> 01:12:23.217]  And I said, nah, he'll take a bite out of freedom.
[01:12:23.778 --> 01:12:27.921]  And I was doing McGruff the Crime Dog, but now, nah, McGruff the Nazi Dog.
[01:12:27.941 --> 01:12:30.263]  Nah, take a bite out of the Second Amendment.
[01:12:30.423 --> 01:12:31.484]  Did you know how McGruff does that?
[01:12:31.524 --> 01:12:33.025]  He takes a bite out of crime.
[01:12:33.926 --> 01:12:36.829]  And now you hear these Ad Council ads, and it's a report.
[01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:42.974]  And, you know, your government needs you to volunteer to help them.
[01:12:42.994 --> 01:12:51.961]  I mean, all these Orwellian ads that you hear from the Ad Council, it gets all this federal and then private money to do this.
[01:12:52.061 --> 01:12:53.062]  It's very scary.
[01:12:53.943 --> 01:12:54.223]  It is.
[01:12:54.363 --> 01:12:58.086]  You know, I mean, I've been listening to you for about seven months now, and I first got
[01:12:58.618 --> 01:13:00.820]  You know, sometimes if you don't laugh, you know, you'll feel like
[01:13:27.296 --> 01:13:29.017]  No, you've got to laugh.
[01:13:29.277 --> 01:13:33.938]  You've got to keep our spirits up, but be serious at the same time and stay focused on exposing it.
[01:13:33.958 --> 01:13:34.658]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:34.998 --> 01:13:35.898]  Really good hearing from you.
[01:13:35.998 --> 01:13:38.999]  I'm trying to find these articles.
[01:13:39.099 --> 01:13:42.240]  I had them in one of the three stacks.
[01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:44.581]  Oh, here they are.
[01:13:45.081 --> 01:13:45.481]  Here they are.
[01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:46.061]  Good, I found it.
[01:13:46.081 --> 01:13:47.822]  There's just so much here, folks.
[01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:48.282]  So much.
[01:13:49.099 --> 01:13:58.162]  Third columnist paid by Bush administration, according to a report on Salon.com, another columnist has been paid to promote Bush administration initiatives.
[01:13:58.442 --> 01:13:58.782]  It's over 2,000.
[01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.583]  Okay, folks, I have the numbers.
[01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:09.345]  Salon claims the Department of Health and Human Services paid conservative columnist Mark McManus $10,000 to back the Bush marriage agenda.
[01:14:09.626 --> 01:14:13.887]  The full registration restricted article can be found here.
[01:14:15.197 --> 01:14:15.757]  And it goes on.
[01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:29.847]  One day after President Bush ordered his cabinet secretaries to stop hiring commentators to help promote administration initiatives, and one day after the second high-profile conservative pundit was found to be on the federal payroll, a third embarrassing hire has emerged.
[01:14:30.787 --> 01:14:44.977]  Salon has confirmed that Michael McManus, a marriage advocate who syndicated the column Ethics and Religion, appears in 50 newspapers, was hired as a subcontractor by the Department of Health and Human Services to foster a Bush-approved marriage initiative.
[01:14:45.945 --> 01:14:49.147]  And again, that all sounds good, but you can't have government in that business.
[01:14:49.207 --> 01:14:54.930]  And again, what they're doing is they're, on purpose, they're exposing payments for things that don't sound that bad.
[01:14:55.531 --> 01:15:00.894]  What about $76 million to put fake newscasts on about how good the prescription drug deal is?
[01:15:00.934 --> 01:15:02.295]  See, you don't hear a lot about that.
[01:15:02.795 --> 01:15:11.180]  Or what about the hundreds of millions that are spent at what I call propaganda placement to actually pay the TV shows to put anti-gun messages in them?
[01:15:11.698 --> 01:15:12.898]  They've been caught doing this.
[01:15:13.278 --> 01:15:17.779]  I mean, Jerry Bruckheimer is admittedly contracted with the government, writing scripts for them.
[01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:20.380]  Scripting how to do the Saving Private Lynch story.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.360]  BBC reported.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.300]  I mean, that's where the meat of it is.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.621]  But they focus in on some little crumbs at the edge.
[01:15:28.341 --> 01:15:31.662]  And the conservatives hear it and go, well, you know, I mean, so what?
[01:15:31.702 --> 01:15:33.222]  You know, we're fighting the liberals here.
[01:15:34.622 --> 01:15:37.303]  Oh yeah, how about hundreds of millions for anti-gun initiatives?
[01:15:37.943 --> 01:15:38.343]  See, you...
[01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:40.798]  I guess that's okay, too, with you.
[01:15:41.399 --> 01:15:41.939]  Here's another one.
[01:15:41.959 --> 01:16:07.860]  Senators introduced Stop Government Propaganda Act, New York in response to continued revelations of government-funded journalism, ranging from reported video news releases put out by the drug czar's office and the Department of Health and Human Services, and recently uncovered payments to columnist Armstrong Williams, Maggie Gallagher, whose flack administration programs, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and
[01:16:08.456 --> 01:16:14.538]  Frank R. Lautenberg will introduce a bill to stop Government Propaganda Act in next week's Senate.
[01:16:15.358 --> 01:16:18.099]  It's not enough to say, please don't do it anymore.
[01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:27.322]  Alex Hormunis, Lautenberg's spokesman, told E&P Legislative Systems sometimes is required, as we believe is in this case.
[01:16:28.802 --> 01:16:31.083]  And the Stop Government Propaganda Act...
[01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:39.657]  Funds appropriated to an executive branch agency may not be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States unless authorized by law.
[01:16:41.218 --> 01:16:44.820]  And it's time for Congress to shut down the administration's propaganda mill.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.522]  Lautenberg said in a statement, it has no place in the United States government.
[01:16:48.802 --> 01:16:55.346]  The bill is co-sponsored by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat Illinois, and John Corzine, Democrat New Jersey.
[01:16:56.914 --> 01:17:01.519]  But again, you guys didn't care back when Bill Clinton was doing this.
[01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:19.257]  I mean, I remember when it came out when Bill Clinton actually on NBC and CBS, they funded whole special newscasts and whole special hour-long specials that looked like newscasts with the normal newscast anchors promoting the socialized health care.
[01:17:20.968 --> 01:17:23.050]  And gun control programs and all this.
[01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:27.893]  So when you watch TV, I wonder why every channel is saying Schwarzenegger should be our next president.
[01:17:28.573 --> 01:17:39.901]  And when you watch TV and every channel is saying guns are bad, and you watch this stuff and you notice the same things in the sitcom, that's in the drama, that's in the news, word for word, there's a reason for it.
[01:17:40.682 --> 01:17:49.288]  Number one, the same corporations that own our government and own the military and own the drug companies and own the private prisons own the media.
[01:17:50.296 --> 01:17:58.723]  But at the same time, then a lot of these people individually, to get them involved in the whole ball of wax, are lavishly paid.
[01:17:59.523 --> 01:18:00.264]  Lavishly.
[01:18:01.325 --> 01:18:13.094]  And I mean, I have it from inside sources, good sources, that over 2,000 prominent media individuals, mainly in TV and newspapers, are paid.
[01:18:13.995 --> 01:18:16.237]  And are paid to put out a certain line.
[01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:20.969]  And if a talk show host won't talk about this, it's very suspect.
[01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:24.191]  And we've talked about this a lot on the air.
[01:18:24.632 --> 01:18:26.233]  We've gone over the documents on the air.
[01:18:26.313 --> 01:18:30.115]  We've had Sherman Skolnick on about this, who first uncovered this 30 years ago.
[01:18:30.596 --> 01:18:39.942]  A lot of your local TV anchors and others, instead of being paid, they actually pay to get their anchor spot, a large percentage of their paycheck.
[01:18:40.462 --> 01:18:41.823]  So that's kind of a mafia thing, too.
[01:18:42.043 --> 01:18:44.225]  You have no idea how corrupt it is, folks.
[01:18:44.975 --> 01:18:48.799]  But not on this little independent network and the independent stations that carry us.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.401]  That's the mark of honor.
[01:18:53.383 --> 01:18:57.586]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:18:58.347 --> 01:19:06.615]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:19:07.215 --> 01:19:08.937]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:10.258]  While you listen,
[01:19:10.916 --> 01:19:15.598]  Verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:19:16.239 --> 01:19:17.800]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.501]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:19:21.101 --> 01:19:23.102]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:19:23.683 --> 01:19:24.763]  And it's so easy.
[01:19:25.504 --> 01:19:27.565]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:19:28.345 --> 01:19:28.945]  When you want.
[01:19:29.506 --> 01:19:30.126]  Where you want.
[01:19:30.946 --> 01:19:35.869]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[01:19:36.798 --> 01:19:39.341]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[01:19:39.361 --> 01:19:39.501]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:19:39.521 --> 01:19:40.022]  That's 419-W-O-R-D.
[01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:40.342]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:19:53.129 --> 01:19:54.109]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:58.970]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:06.932]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.192 --> 01:20:12.573]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.773 --> 01:20:19.755]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:20.055 --> 01:20:25.398]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.658 --> 01:20:30.381]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:38.345]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.665 --> 01:20:44.149]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:45.209 --> 01:20:46.870]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:55.032]  The war on terrorism.
[01:20:55.372 --> 01:20:58.153]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:58.413 --> 01:21:02.574]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:02.994 --> 01:21:03.835]  So what do you do?
[01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:08.716]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:11.338]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:22:43.636 --> 01:22:44.617]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:44.657 --> 01:22:45.818]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:45.838 --> 01:22:48.019]  So see, they're going to psychologically test...
[01:23:04.361 --> 01:23:10.943]  Your children in the schools forcibly drug them, test them for their weight, take them from you if they're overweight and you don't lose weight.
[01:23:11.183 --> 01:23:12.784]  It's all about getting government into your life.
[01:23:12.844 --> 01:23:17.566]  And now, your child draws a picture of a stick figure with a sword stabbing someone.
[01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:19.206]  Oh, look, it's you getting stabbed.
[01:23:20.067 --> 01:23:20.627]  Oh, that's it.
[01:23:20.807 --> 01:23:22.467]  Oh, criminals, we're charging you with felonies.
[01:23:22.487 --> 01:23:23.348]  You're 10-year-olds.
[01:23:23.988 --> 01:23:25.989]  It's all about getting you into the system.
[01:23:26.009 --> 01:23:27.049]  This is terrifying.
[01:23:28.329 --> 01:23:29.690]  It's horrible what's happening.
[01:23:31.534 --> 01:23:34.715]  And it's just so corrupt.
[01:23:34.775 --> 01:23:36.355]  It's scientifically corrupted.
[01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.756]  We've just got to say no to it, folks.
[01:23:39.976 --> 01:23:40.216]  No.
[01:23:40.376 --> 01:23:45.477]  You're not turning the public schools into prisons, no matter what Dr. Phil says.
[01:23:46.357 --> 01:23:51.218]  Phil, you may say we're slaves of the government, because you're on the propaganda channel, but we're not listening to you.
[01:23:52.019 --> 01:23:53.379]  That's what a caller was mentioning earlier.
[01:23:53.739 --> 01:23:56.279]  Let's go ahead and go to William.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:57.980]  William, welcome.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:58.540]  You're on the air.
[01:23:59.229 --> 01:24:00.530]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:03.351]  The program today is really important.
[01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:11.614]  All of the tyranny that is going on in America is leading to a whole new age that people don't want to go there.
[01:24:11.875 --> 01:24:21.159]  And they better listen to you, because what you're saying here, and I'm sure your guest is going to say on this chimera, is pretty frightening, but it's all very true, and it's in the regular media.
[01:24:21.979 --> 01:24:23.280]  I want to make a couple comments.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.882]  I belong to the Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, and the stem cell lines that the president certified
[01:24:29.534 --> 01:24:32.096]  Which, again, shows its duplicity.
[01:24:32.316 --> 01:24:35.358]  It certifies certain stem cell lines but won't certify new ones.
[01:24:36.499 --> 01:24:38.841]  They're all contaminated, so they've been proven useless.
[01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:41.243]  I just got that information a couple of days ago.
[01:24:41.803 --> 01:24:46.607]  So they can't be used for human stem cell research because they produce an autoimmune reaction.
[01:24:47.588 --> 01:24:58.836]  They've also just come out in the fall with research that proves that these chimeras that they're creating release a virus called the PERV, which is a porcine virus that's like AIDS.
[01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:00.174]  Only much worse.
[01:25:00.555 --> 01:25:07.639]  And if this gets out, these various viruses that are actually in animals could then be able to lock onto humans and kill millions.
[01:25:08.496 --> 01:25:12.939]  Oh, yeah, I mean, it's all, and top scientists have said that it's like Russian roulette.
[01:25:13.139 --> 01:25:19.863]  Right, and this is not something that's... Crossing, you know, goats with spiders, humans with pigs, humans with cockroaches.
[01:25:19.883 --> 01:25:21.304]  They've got a thing called bio-steel.
[01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:25.866]  It's actually sheep that have milk that have spider webs in it, so they create this bio-steel.
[01:25:26.066 --> 01:25:28.668]  No, I mean, I had the CEO on, like, four years ago.
[01:25:28.968 --> 01:25:29.428]  Exactly.
[01:25:29.448 --> 01:25:31.370]  He's at a military base in upstate New York.
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:34.011]  I want to make a comment about Arnold, because Arnold is our favorite.
[01:25:34.331 --> 01:25:34.792]  He, uh...
[01:25:36.472 --> 01:25:43.375]  In California, put around six million of his own money into this initiative to forward stem cell research in California.
[01:25:44.235 --> 01:25:51.578]  And, of course, Arnold, being Austrian, it's in the perfect ilk, being from the nations that started the whole research back before the Second World War.
[01:25:53.198 --> 01:25:55.659]  Yes, we've got to go ahead and do the cloning.
[01:25:56.079 --> 01:25:57.120]  We've got to move forward.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.901]  And, again, here he is.
[01:26:00.001 --> 01:26:03.282]  The media is showing this a decade or more ago with the sixth...
[01:26:05.277 --> 01:26:12.480]  All the movies are about throwing it in our face.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.862]  Yeah, they do.
[01:26:17.222 --> 01:26:22.284]  And I'm going to go back to my closing statement will be Genesis 3, 22-24.
[01:26:22.924 --> 01:26:24.685]  I'll just summarize because you can read it yourself.
[01:26:25.425 --> 01:26:30.487]  Basically, God said, I'm not going to let man reach forth and take from the tree of life and live forever in this fallen state.
[01:26:31.488 --> 01:26:31.628]  And...
[01:26:32.589 --> 01:26:41.193]  I really believe that we're now in such an amoral state that we're at the same point that Noah said when God said to Noah that he was going to destroy the earth with a flood.
[01:26:41.813 --> 01:26:46.295]  We're at that same point right now because we're about to completely take over human reproduction.
[01:26:46.355 --> 01:26:55.179]  Children have now lost their rights of parents to own them so that your property rights of your children is now a part of the state.
[01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.179]  Now the state owns your children.
[01:26:57.239 --> 01:26:59.240]  That's not true, but they say they do.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:26:59.961]  Exactly.
[01:27:00.001 --> 01:27:00.941]  The next phase, of course,
[01:27:01.457 --> 01:27:05.060]  It's for the states who intrude to the point where they actually take over human reproduction.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.601]  They said they're going to do it.
[01:27:06.641 --> 01:27:07.642]  I appreciate the call.
[01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:08.923]  It's Dr. Deagle calling.
[01:27:08.943 --> 01:27:09.583]  Good to hear from you.
[01:27:10.204 --> 01:27:11.505]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:27:11.565 --> 01:27:12.285]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:27:13.386 --> 01:27:13.886]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:14.007 --> 01:27:14.527]  Hello.
[01:27:14.887 --> 01:27:17.169]  Calling from New York where you can't tell lawyer jokes.
[01:27:18.087 --> 01:27:18.807]  Oh, that's right.
[01:27:18.827 --> 01:27:20.468]  You tell a lawyer a joke, you get arrested.
[01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:21.128]  It's hateful.
[01:27:21.188 --> 01:27:22.829]  I'm acquainted with those two guys.
[01:27:23.129 --> 01:27:26.750]  I wonder maybe if you ever want to interview them, who knows, I may be able to talk to them about it.
[01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:27.690]  Yeah, I'd like to have them on.
[01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:29.451]  In fact, I told my producer I want those guys on.
[01:27:29.771 --> 01:27:32.291]  Yeah, they're from a legal reform group.
[01:27:32.612 --> 01:27:34.892]  I think that was part of the reason why they ran into problems.
[01:27:35.512 --> 01:27:44.135]  Hey, listen, we don't have to worry about people being cowed, you know, and made to be like rabbits, because now Chinese genetic engineering will turn us into rabbits.
[01:27:44.615 --> 01:27:46.856]  And your guest will probably speak about that very soon.
[01:27:47.441 --> 01:27:48.562]  That's an abomination.
[01:27:48.842 --> 01:27:51.064]  That's an abomination in the face of the creator.
[01:27:51.084 --> 01:27:52.185]  So what are you talking about?
[01:27:52.205 --> 01:27:54.166]  The latest article about crossing us with rabbits?
[01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:54.526]  Uh-huh.
[01:27:54.746 --> 01:27:55.587]  What's wrong with that?
[01:27:55.607 --> 01:27:56.107]  That's freedom.
[01:27:56.868 --> 01:27:59.330]  Well, I guess we do need a few minotaurs, right?
[01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:02.032]  Like in Greek mythology, the half man, half bull.
[01:28:03.012 --> 01:28:06.955]  And if I do recall, too, if you ever read The Time Machine by H.G.
[01:28:06.995 --> 01:28:11.279]  Wells, I think he went way ahead in the future and people were rabbit-like creatures, if you remember that.
[01:28:12.179 --> 01:28:13.640]  Well, Wells was all for it.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.281]  He was a top New World Order strategist.
[01:28:15.301 --> 01:28:17.163]  He was non-fiction book, The New World Order.
[01:28:18.005 --> 01:28:20.046]  And then what, 36 gets into all that?
[01:28:20.407 --> 01:28:23.468]  And the PSAs, we have one here, and they talk about gun crimes.
[01:28:23.509 --> 01:28:26.610]  You know there's no such thing as a charge called gun crime anywhere.
[01:28:27.091 --> 01:28:30.753]  Yet they talk about, they have like a judge, you have been charged with gun crime.
[01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:32.234]  There's no such charge.
[01:28:32.254 --> 01:28:34.355]  Which is just as bad as thought crime.
[01:28:34.595 --> 01:28:35.476]  Thought crime, right.
[01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.637]  And this is what we're coming down to.
[01:28:38.317 --> 01:28:39.678]  We're in bad shape with this.
[01:28:39.998 --> 01:28:40.679]  It's freedom!
[01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:44.604]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.105 --> 01:28:46.709]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.631 --> 01:28:50.298]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.828 --> 01:29:01.310]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:05.971]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.191 --> 01:29:13.233]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.613 --> 01:29:19.735]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.075]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.195 --> 01:29:21.736]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.192 --> 01:29:41.295]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:29:41.315 --> 01:29:41.355]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:41.455]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.675 --> 01:29:42.556]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.596 --> 01:29:42.856]  Call today.
[01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:54.143]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:54.243 --> 01:29:55.123]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.283 --> 01:29:59.367]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:02.409]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.489 --> 01:30:09.194]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.394 --> 01:30:12.377]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.597 --> 01:30:14.999]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.099 --> 01:30:23.205]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[01:30:23.285 --> 01:30:24.886]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:56.694]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[01:30:56.994 --> 01:31:01.279]  But have you heard about BioOxidous Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[01:31:01.519 --> 01:31:08.446]  BioOxidous Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:31:08.826 --> 01:31:15.494]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[01:31:15.794 --> 01:31:19.278]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[01:31:19.418 --> 01:31:20.219]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[01:31:24.384 --> 01:31:31.527]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[01:31:31.587 --> 01:31:38.310]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:43.173]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:45.894]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:31:46.054 --> 01:31:50.716]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[01:31:53.525 --> 01:32:02.575]  We're going to be talking to Dr. Professor David Magnus.
[01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:23.417]  Director for the Stanford Center for Bioethical Ethics at Stanford University about chimeras, clones, and bioethics.
[01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:28.342]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:37.431]  But before we go to Dr. Magnus, my friends, you need to understand how both parties are controlled by the same corporate interests.
[01:32:38.343 --> 01:32:41.525]  And how these elections at the presidential level are staged.
[01:32:41.945 --> 01:32:44.867]  Because the rhetoric's different, but it doesn't matter who gets in office.
[01:32:44.887 --> 01:32:46.067]  The agenda is the same.
[01:32:46.507 --> 01:32:56.973]  This is so important, especially for neocons and liberals, people that just don't get it, and all that politics means to them is like some football, you know, fight rah-rah for my team.
[01:32:58.044 --> 01:32:59.686]  Well, the same people own both teams.
[01:33:00.287 --> 01:33:03.391]  And that's what my new film, American Dictators, documents.
[01:33:03.892 --> 01:33:08.478]  It's a staged election of 2004 and shows how it didn't matter who won to begin with.
[01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:12.463]  And it gets into Skull and Bones and gets into the corporate interest and gets into 9-11.
[01:33:12.844 --> 01:33:13.966]  It's really an important film.
[01:33:15.026 --> 01:33:17.307]  It's $19.95 for one DVD.
[01:33:17.327 --> 01:33:24.070]  Each additional DVD, while we keep doing this, not much longer, $5.95, which you can buy four or five copies and give them to friends and family.
[01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:26.911]  Same thing with 9-11, Road to Tyranny, the preeminent film.
[01:33:26.931 --> 01:33:29.952]  The New York Post said Michael Moore ripped off to make his film.
[01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:30.752]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:33:30.792 --> 01:33:33.153]  We do know Moore got a copy of it years ago.
[01:33:33.173 --> 01:33:34.153]  You need to get 9-11, Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:34.173 --> 01:33:34.734]  $24.95, almost three hours long.
[01:33:34.754 --> 01:33:35.774]  $5.95 for each additional copy.
[01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:47.999]  And just so much more at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, where you can order via the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[01:33:48.699 --> 01:33:49.940]  Or you can call toll-free.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.140]  Operators are there right now.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:59.944]  You can call and ask questions about the different specials and titles.
[01:33:59.964 --> 01:34:01.204]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:34:01.484 --> 01:34:10.368]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, where you can watch all my films online, read a bunch of different e-books we've got posted, including my book and Paul Watson's book,
[01:34:11.028 --> 01:34:17.818]  And my weekly TV report, my local TV show that's won Best of Austin, now you can get it nationwide at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:24.943]  All right, we're going to go ahead and go to Professor David Magnus.
[01:34:25.764 --> 01:34:27.645]  And, I mean, there's so much here.
[01:34:27.765 --> 01:34:35.290]  On Infowars.com, I have this National Geographic article, Animal-Human Hybrid Spark Controversy.
[01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:43.635]  We've got a huge 10-page long data page full of AP articles, Washington Post articles, just all the stuff that's going on.
[01:34:44.776 --> 01:34:46.697]  And I guess the way to start this conversation
[01:34:47.395 --> 01:34:50.340]  First off, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:34:50.881 --> 01:34:51.342]  My pleasure.
[01:34:52.043 --> 01:34:59.995]  And then secondarily, about a year ago, I was at a store picking up a pizza at the counter and a guy walks over and he goes, I had biology!
[01:35:00.803 --> 01:35:06.588]  In college at UT, and you're a liar, there's no cross-species stuff, there's no such thing as spider goats.
[01:35:07.069 --> 01:35:10.151]  He goes, I saw your TV show and you talked about it and you're crazy.
[01:35:10.672 --> 01:35:11.773]  I said, well, when were you in college?
[01:35:11.793 --> 01:35:12.013]  Well, 1976.
[01:35:13.494 --> 01:35:19.620]  And the guy just couldn't believe it, even though I interviewed the CEO from the company in upstate New York where they have these
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.503]  You know, these goats that produce this body armor.
[01:35:24.143 --> 01:35:25.965]  How do you respond to somebody like that, doctor?
[01:35:26.285 --> 01:35:27.967]  Well, they're just misinformed.
[01:35:28.607 --> 01:35:39.776]  Transgenics has been here for quite a while, and it's something that actually sparked an important revolution commercially as well as scientifically, starting way back in the 80s.
[01:35:40.117 --> 01:35:43.680]  So we started off genetically engineering bacteria, including putting human genes.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:46.282]  So some of the first human chimeras
[01:35:46.662 --> 01:35:53.605]  We're from this bioengineering where we put human genes into bacteria, for example, to produce human insulin.
[01:35:53.885 --> 01:35:58.107]  So when diabetics take insulin, there was a big shift that took place about 20 years ago.
[01:35:58.167 --> 01:36:00.888]  Previously they'd been taking cow insulin.
[01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:04.169]  Now virtually everybody who has insulin who's diabetic
[01:36:04.409 --> 01:36:04.789]  I think so.
[01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:32.852]  You're taking spider genes and introducing that into a goat, into their embryos, and that's also being done.
[01:36:33.152 --> 01:36:35.713]  They now have mice that have human genes in them.
[01:36:35.733 --> 01:36:37.434]  There are pigs that have human genes in them.
[01:36:37.454 --> 01:36:39.495]  It's called sometimes humanizing them.
[01:36:39.555 --> 01:36:50.280]  Try and make them more like us, both to create better models for disease, or in the case of pigs, to try and get organs that we're less likely to reject for transplantation purposes.
[01:36:50.928 --> 01:37:10.142]  What about the danger, and I've seen this in some of the articles, callers have mentioned it, of when you start splicing genes, unintended consequences, you know, giving rise to animal viruses or bacteria that affect other mammals but didn't affect us, and now giving rise to superbugs?
[01:37:10.682 --> 01:37:13.925]  That's certainly a worry that everybody has about xenotransplantation.
[01:37:13.965 --> 01:37:19.689]  So we're genetically engineering pigs to try and use them to put pig parts into humans.
[01:37:19.749 --> 01:37:21.631]  And in fact, even that's been done for a long time.
[01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:26.875]  So for heart valves, we've been putting pig heart valves into human patients for quite a while.
[01:37:27.215 --> 01:37:35.642]  But as that progresses, and there's talking about putting in pig hearts into humans, as that happens, there's certainly a risk for public health
[01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:48.310]  That there may very well be viruses that right now do not affect humans that are only problems in the porcine family that will wind up affecting human beings and we may not have defenses for them.
[01:37:49.279 --> 01:38:04.665]  I've heard discussions of in the future taking, say, eight genes, putting them into a human, but then saying, well, this clone isn't a human, so it doesn't have any rights, because this humanoid creature has these simian genes.
[01:38:05.405 --> 01:38:09.767]  I think that's probably less likely to be an application of the technology.
[01:38:09.807 --> 01:38:16.750]  I think the public wouldn't stand for it, and I think that's probably not... But I've had different bioethics groups on, even people that are on the President's Council,
[01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:21.912]  And they've gone over what, New Jersey passed a law where they can bring the clone up to term if they want to.
[01:38:23.112 --> 01:38:26.033]  Well, I think for reproductive purposes they can't.
[01:38:26.073 --> 01:38:31.155]  So they can't produce a cloned human that the FDA has claimed.
[01:38:31.175 --> 01:38:34.716]  Yeah, but for parts they can bring it up to term.
[01:38:34.776 --> 01:38:35.556]  I've read the bill on air.
[01:38:35.956 --> 01:38:44.284]  If it's not, it would have to be the case that it's not, doesn't have a central nervous system that would allow it to count as a human being.
[01:38:44.344 --> 01:38:48.468]  Anything that counts as a human being, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over that.
[01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:55.976]  And for any reproduction, cloning for reproductive purposes, the FDA has claimed that at the federal level they have the right to shut down any labs.
[01:38:56.016 --> 01:38:58.238]  Now, but this wouldn't be for reproductive purposes.
[01:38:58.338 --> 01:39:00.200]  In fact, I could dig the law out.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:07.105]  I mean, I had a bunch of experts on about this, and the way the law clearly read is this was for research.
[01:39:07.145 --> 01:39:09.567]  For research purposes is a different story.
[01:39:09.607 --> 01:39:19.295]  So if you're not aiming at reproduction, so if you're trying to just create embryos, for example, and develop them out a little bit for different research purposes, that's something that is done and continues to be done.
[01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.116]  So where do you stand on all this?
[01:39:21.136 --> 01:39:22.137]  I mean, what's your view of it?
[01:39:22.417 --> 01:39:26.060]  So my view is that a lot depends on the particular application and how it's being used.
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.342]  So I think everybody can agree that there are certain things that would be problematic.
[01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:41.646]  So putting, genetically engineering mice so that they can produce human sperm or eggs and then allowing a child to be developed under those circumstances where their parents would literally be mice.
[01:39:42.173 --> 01:39:44.935]  It's something that I think everybody would agree is morally problematic.
[01:39:45.236 --> 01:39:50.160]  Bringing a subhuman to term and giving birth is clearly something that should be prohibited.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:40:06.693]  On the other hand, creating embryos that have different properties so that you can study those properties at that very early stage of development outside the human body where there's no way these things are ever going to turn into people, that I think is something that's of useful scientific value.
[01:40:07.992 --> 01:40:12.677]  And the in-between is what do you do about creating animals that have human-like properties?
[01:40:12.998 --> 01:40:14.559]  And there it depends on where you draw the line.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:20.306]  On the one hand, we want mice that will be better models so that before we do research on humans, we know that it's safe.
[01:40:21.147 --> 01:40:22.168]  So that's a good thing.
[01:40:22.248 --> 01:40:22.849]  On the other hand,
[01:40:23.329 --> 01:40:28.935]  You know, how many human brain neurons can you put into a mouse's brain before you've gone too far?
[01:40:28.975 --> 01:40:31.998]  Presumably, if the mice start complaining, you went way too far.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:39.825]  So drawing those lines about what kind of entity you've got is something that's, I think, going to take a lot of careful deliberation.
[01:40:40.186 --> 01:40:41.807]  What about Chimera?
[01:40:41.887 --> 01:40:45.591]  I mean, I'm reading here that it can be more than two species.
[01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:50.111]  I mean, how many species' genetics have they put into one creature?
[01:40:50.531 --> 01:40:56.875]  Well, you could take individual cells from a lot of different creatures, and the limitations now are probably mostly technical ones.
[01:40:56.915 --> 01:41:01.157]  So you could probably put in... You could have combined transgenics with...
[01:41:01.577 --> 01:41:01.977]  I think we're good.
[01:41:18.897 --> 01:41:30.343]  There's a group of people who don't like any of this, including any transgenics, on the grounds that, you know, species are inviolable, that these are categories that should not be monkeyed with.
[01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:36.606]  But the IBM Human Genome Project, I've talked to some of their people, they've got the attitude that all mutation is natural.
[01:41:37.166 --> 01:41:47.335]  In the scheme of things, we are simply an arm of evolution in that we are accelerating it, and anything that rises from human activity is, hence, already natural, and I think that's very, very dangerous.
[01:41:47.635 --> 01:41:48.876]  And again, it's Russian roulette.
[01:41:48.897 --> 01:41:53.641]  They have no idea what any of this is going to cause, what type of domino effect this can create.
[01:41:53.721 --> 01:41:54.982]  It's insanity.
[01:41:55.282 --> 01:41:57.604]  Well, I think I tend to take a middle ground.
[01:41:57.624 --> 01:42:01.287]  So on the one hand, I would say I don't think we should open the floodgates.
[01:42:01.427 --> 01:42:05.250]  They're correct that mutation is natural and that we are an option of evolution.
[01:42:05.511 --> 01:42:08.333]  I don't think it follows from that that anything we do is okay.
[01:42:08.473 --> 01:42:10.475]  That to me is a specious argument.
[01:42:10.735 --> 01:42:15.759]  On the other hand, I don't think that we should say that there are any lines that say we can't monkey with anything.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.701]  There are certain things that are sacrosanct.
[01:42:17.881 --> 01:42:20.082]  I think you have to look at what the implications are.
[01:42:20.422 --> 01:42:27.505]  I don't think anybody would want to go back and say, you know, bacteria are sacrosanct and we shouldn't genetically engineer them and put genes in there.
[01:42:27.805 --> 01:42:34.487]  It's been very useful for diabetics and it's made a lot of lives better that we've been able to create medications and biologics and do a lot of things.
[01:42:34.507 --> 01:42:36.208]  So what does your center mainly do?
[01:42:36.228 --> 01:42:40.890]  I mean, you're the director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics at the Stanford University.
[01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:41.990]  I mean, what do you mainly do?
[01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:45.051]  We spend our time doing four main activities.
[01:42:45.231 --> 01:42:48.392]  One, we do a lot of research on a range of issues in ethics.
[01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:55.335]  So we spend a lot of time dealing with issues in genetics, dealing issues with neuroethics, end of life issues, stem cell research.
[01:42:55.655 --> 01:42:58.116]  And so we have a lot of people doing both empirical research
[01:42:58.576 --> 01:43:03.742]  As well as philosophical normative research into exploring the ethics of all these issues.
[01:43:03.762 --> 01:43:04.543]  You're an expert on this.
[01:43:04.563 --> 01:43:05.644]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:43:05.684 --> 01:43:09.849]  I mean, I've seen the reports, the scientific reports, but you can find a report saying whatever you want.
[01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:19.780]  In your opinion, is it true that, say, full-grown female breast tissue is a stem cell source, in many cases is even better than fetal tissue?
[01:43:21.418 --> 01:43:23.319]  I think it's way too early to know that right now.
[01:43:24.099 --> 01:43:26.400]  I'm sure you've seen the studies saying that.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:27.840]  What do you think of those studies?
[01:43:28.161 --> 01:43:34.723]  I think at this point people are doing research, but it's still very... Why the obsession with the fetal stem cell?
[01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:37.344]  It's a source of tissue.
[01:43:37.784 --> 01:43:44.406]  One reason is that fetal tissue is usable under NIH guidelines, whereas embryonic stem cell research, for example, is not.
[01:43:44.807 --> 01:43:48.048]  So there's a line that can be drawn that way.
[01:43:49.028 --> 01:43:54.633]  But is it because the tissue of a developing human is so malleable?
[01:43:54.653 --> 01:43:59.278]  In terms of comparing that to adult stem cells, yes, that's correct.
[01:43:59.338 --> 01:44:03.522]  So there are advantages to using some of those cells.
[01:44:03.562 --> 01:44:05.564]  They can differentiate a little bit more easily.
[01:44:05.764 --> 01:44:10.689]  They don't have the breadth of differentiation ability that an embryonic stem cell would have, but fetal
[01:44:11.429 --> 01:44:30.345]  This tissue can give rise to stem cells that seem to be easier to develop because they're part of an organism that... But doesn't the fetal stem cell then accelerate the risk because of its unstable nature to developing higher chances of some viral or bacterial spinoff?
[01:44:30.625 --> 01:44:31.886]  That is an excellent question.
[01:44:31.986 --> 01:44:35.229]  So the issue about whether or not these things will turn out to be safe
[01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:38.491]  Well, actually, if they're secret, obviously I don't have knowledge of them.
[01:44:57.401 --> 01:45:00.782]  I mean, they must be pretty big, because I know a lot of doctors that they've tried to recruit into them.
[01:45:01.022 --> 01:45:02.462]  I know the scientists that have been in them.
[01:45:02.762 --> 01:45:04.083]  I mean, my dad's an oral surgeon.
[01:45:04.103 --> 01:45:06.443]  They tried to recruit him into one back in the 80s.
[01:45:06.463 --> 01:45:09.004]  I mean, this must be a giant program.
[01:45:09.204 --> 01:45:13.225]  All I can do is work on the programs and the research that I know about.
[01:45:13.665 --> 01:45:19.407]  So the research that I know about, where people are proposing to do research using fetal stem cells,
[01:45:20.307 --> 01:45:21.789]  I think we have to look really carefully.
[01:45:21.829 --> 01:45:26.272]  There are some guidelines and regulatory guidelines in place for how those tissues are to be used.
[01:45:26.632 --> 01:45:30.355]  If they're going to do these tests, shouldn't they do them in a Level 4 facility?
[01:45:31.985 --> 01:45:33.706]  It depends on what the material is.
[01:45:33.766 --> 01:45:39.771]  I think for some of it, it's not so much that this is a risk of something getting out and contamination, which is what a level four security would require.
[01:45:39.811 --> 01:45:40.351]  But they don't know.
[01:45:40.391 --> 01:45:41.392]  They don't know what this could do.
[01:45:41.612 --> 01:45:50.039]  Well, if you're using fetal stem cells from a human, I'm much more worried about not anything spreading to other people.
[01:45:50.359 --> 01:45:52.220]  I'm more worried about what this will do when you introduce it.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.381]  Well, look, here's the thing, Doctor.
[01:45:53.401 --> 01:45:56.183]  You sound like a nice person, Doctor Professor.
[01:45:56.203 --> 01:45:58.205]  But this is the problem.
[01:45:58.225 --> 01:45:59.486]  This is a slippery slope.
[01:45:59.526 --> 01:46:01.287]  There's no way you can go butt down.
[01:46:01.767 --> 01:46:03.829]  It's going to be unlimited unless it's restricted.
[01:46:04.049 --> 01:46:05.550]  The elite wants the life extension.
[01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:06.751]  The general public wants it.
[01:46:07.231 --> 01:46:08.392]  And it's going to be done.
[01:46:08.672 --> 01:46:09.973]  And I see no end to it.
[01:46:10.013 --> 01:46:11.735]  And it's just going to go absolutely wild.
[01:46:12.075 --> 01:46:17.519]  And then this argument for global government is, well, we've got to stop third world countries from uncontrolled...
[01:46:18.719 --> 01:46:20.840]  Well, I guess the way I look at it is it's a balancing act.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.361]  In the Judeo-Christian religious tradition, we're given obligations to both preserve the garden and to tend the garden.
[01:46:43.085 --> 01:46:48.990]  So we have this tension between our desire to try and maintain the world and our desire to try and improve the world.
[01:46:49.370 --> 01:47:01.220]  I think with all this research, we always have to do this balancing act between making sure that we're not going so far that we've had too much of an instrumental view of the world or gone too far in terms of the damage that we might do.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:07.725]  On the other hand, we have an obligation to try and pursue things that might wind up helping people live better, happier, healthier lives.
[01:47:07.745 --> 01:47:09.947]  Well, Doctor, what I parallel it with is Monsanto.
[01:47:13.072 --> 01:47:13.412]  And others.
[01:47:13.452 --> 01:47:18.076]  I mean, they really are taking plants that don't reproduce.
[01:47:18.116 --> 01:47:20.618]  They really are planting experimental plants open air.
[01:47:20.818 --> 01:47:25.962]  They have been caught spreading into other species of plant and causing mutations and big problems.
[01:47:26.302 --> 01:47:34.188]  And they're trying to corner the market on seeds and plant reproduction, which is actually fundamentally altering the biosphere.
[01:47:35.008 --> 01:47:36.009]  So out of the gates!
[01:47:36.389 --> 01:47:36.810]  You know, they're...
[01:47:37.831 --> 01:47:41.992]  It's just wildly out of control, and it's very destructive.
[01:47:42.173 --> 01:47:44.593]  I think those are exactly the right questions to be looking at.
[01:47:45.053 --> 01:47:49.095]  If a company is developing a technology, are there some good uses of the technology?
[01:47:49.315 --> 01:47:49.795]  Possibly.
[01:47:50.135 --> 01:47:57.478]  Are there ways in which it can be misused and fall into the hands which are going to abuse the technology?
[01:47:57.498 --> 01:47:58.578]  But they own the courts.
[01:47:58.638 --> 01:47:59.538]  Nothing happens to them.
[01:48:03.751 --> 01:48:09.333]  Again, all we can do is if we see examples where corporations have behaved badly, and I guess I disagree.
[01:48:09.533 --> 01:48:10.313]  I'm more optimistic.
[01:48:10.633 --> 01:48:27.439]  When Monsanto first was considering buying Pine and Land that developed the Terminator technology, in the end they gave up the purchase of that and gave up the use of Terminator technology on the grounds of the huge backlash that was largely organized by an NGO at the time called RAFI.
[01:48:27.939 --> 01:48:35.921]  So the fact that there was people saying... Well, the backlash was Europe and Africa and Latin America and Asia wouldn't buy their garbage.
[01:48:36.181 --> 01:48:38.361]  Well, I think that's also part of the backlash.
[01:48:38.381 --> 01:48:43.663]  So the NGOs who were raising these concerns had a huge impact in Europe and in other places.
[01:48:43.943 --> 01:48:45.763]  The backlash didn't happen just in Europe, though.
[01:48:45.783 --> 01:48:47.764]  It happened for the Terminator.
[01:48:47.784 --> 01:48:48.544]  It happened in the U.S.
[01:48:48.604 --> 01:48:48.984]  as well.
[01:48:49.344 --> 01:48:51.244]  And it forced the company to back off from it.
[01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:54.285]  I think French farmers burning buildings down had the biggest effect.
[01:48:54.565 --> 01:48:55.145]  It's not just that.
[01:48:55.185 --> 01:49:07.253]  Look, the Monsanto's new leaf potato, a genetically engineered potato, they wound up completely flopping because McDonald's decided they weren't going to buy them because they were worried about public response to that, even within the U.S.
[01:49:07.373 --> 01:49:08.374]  Well, that is optimistic.
[01:49:08.414 --> 01:49:08.814]  You're right.
[01:49:08.854 --> 01:49:09.915]  So it really does show.
[01:49:11.536 --> 01:49:14.040]  My point is that they're at least trying it.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:14.761]  They're pushing it.
[01:49:14.801 --> 01:49:15.522]  They never stop.
[01:49:15.542 --> 01:49:17.564]  They always look for some new... It's like a rat.
[01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:19.246]  It always tries to find a new way to get in.
[01:49:19.747 --> 01:49:24.954]  But anybody who sells anything to the public has to be concerned about public backlash.
[01:49:25.234 --> 01:49:28.659]  And so those of us who work with the public can have an influence.
[01:49:29.198 --> 01:49:36.505]  Well, Doctor, I've got a few other questions for you about chimeras and cross-species engineering, all of this on the other side.
[01:49:36.525 --> 01:49:39.308]  I want to just get some other examples from your expertise.
[01:49:39.328 --> 01:49:41.430]  We appreciate you joining us, so please stay with us.
[01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:42.911]  I'm Alex Jones, folks.
[01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:50.739]  Be sure to check out the website, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com, and we'll give you the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics website when we get back.
[01:49:53.607 --> 01:49:57.950]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.111 --> 01:50:02.554]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.714 --> 01:50:07.078]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.118 --> 01:50:08.479]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.261 --> 01:50:14.485]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.545 --> 01:50:21.493]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.613 --> 01:50:23.616]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.916 --> 01:50:28.657]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:50:28.677 --> 01:50:30.317]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:30.337 --> 01:50:31.278]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:31.298 --> 01:50:31.838]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:31.898 --> 01:50:32.758]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.288 --> 01:50:54.149]  We're good to go.
[01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.670]  We're good to go.
[01:51:16.894 --> 01:51:26.762]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.882 --> 01:51:35.750]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:39.312]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:51:48.058 --> 01:51:50.859]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:51.039 --> 01:52:00.084]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.304 --> 01:52:02.585]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.766 --> 01:52:09.109]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.909]  Thank you.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:25.360]  We're good to go.
[01:52:54.193 --> 01:52:56.955]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:56.975 --> 01:53:00.838]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.578 --> 01:53:03.319]  That's right, the Genesis Network.
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:13.366]  We're talking to Dr. David Magnus, Director of the Stanford Center for Bioethical Ethics at Stanford University about chimeras, clones, bioethics.
[01:53:14.428 --> 01:53:19.390]  Can you give us the particular website for the biomedical group that you're the head of?
[01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.810]  Sure.
[01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:23.071]  We're at www.scbe.stanford.edu.
[01:53:27.837 --> 01:53:29.057]  scbe.stanford.edu.
[01:53:29.077 --> 01:53:35.379]  Sorry, it's not www, it's http://scbe.stanford.edu.
[01:53:35.659 --> 01:53:39.860]  Or just type in Dr. David Magnus, and I'm sure it'll pop up, too.
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:40.641]  Yep, for sure.
[01:53:40.681 --> 01:53:46.742]  Or just the Center for Biomedical Ethics, or Stanford University Bioethics, probably good for you.
[01:53:47.042 --> 01:53:49.263]  Now, we had a great discussion during the break.
[01:53:49.303 --> 01:53:56.105]  I seem to always do that, but I was asking you how many different types of human chimeras there are versus chimeras, period, and then
[01:53:57.086 --> 01:53:58.127]  Some other points you were making.
[01:53:58.547 --> 01:53:59.108]  Yeah, sure.
[01:53:59.148 --> 01:54:02.311]  There are actually a lot of them, and again, it depends on how you define them.
[01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:10.500]  If you count transgenics, that is organisms that have human genes that have been put into them, basically all biotech organisms are chimeras.
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.145]  So the whole biotech industry is basically genetically engineered bacteria that have human genes in
[01:54:15.185 --> 01:54:15.645]  We're good to go.
[01:54:42.383 --> 01:54:52.310]  And there have already been a couple of scares where it looked like we very nearly had human pharmaceutical products, essentially, enter into the food supply.
[01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:53.831]  Well, that was ProteGene.
[01:54:54.112 --> 01:54:54.952]  ProteGene, correct.
[01:54:55.212 --> 01:54:58.655]  And they had the AIDS virus producing corn.
[01:54:59.556 --> 01:55:00.957]  I don't think it was the AIDS.
[01:55:00.977 --> 01:55:04.039]  It was a monoclonal antibody that they were producing.
[01:55:04.119 --> 01:55:05.600]  No, I mean, it said pig virus.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.181]  One variety had live pig virus.
[01:55:07.201 --> 01:55:08.182]  The other was HIV.
[01:55:08.883 --> 01:55:10.504]  A protein shell.
[01:55:10.704 --> 01:55:12.045]  And then a bunch of other things, too.
[01:55:12.481 --> 01:55:15.923]  And they had a couple of different scares, one in Nebraska and one in Iowa.
[01:55:16.223 --> 01:55:34.233]  And obviously I and a lot of other people think that the idea of having an open pollinator like corn genetically engineered to have something that's not approved for human consumption in states and areas where you've got a lot of commercial agriculture with the same organism is not a very good idea.
[01:55:34.253 --> 01:55:37.875]  But what were they thinking, open air and 96 sites?
[01:55:40.818 --> 01:55:47.324]  They put in some different confinement techniques that they hoped would be able to work.
[01:55:47.364 --> 01:55:51.628]  They have physical confinement methods so they keep the fields somewhat separate.
[01:55:52.449 --> 01:55:56.313]  They also have a lot of detasseling that takes place.
[01:55:57.153 --> 01:56:03.295]  They have different things that they put in place to try and make sure that there's segregation of everything that takes place.
[01:56:03.595 --> 01:56:05.636]  But all those things are prone to error.
[01:56:05.656 --> 01:56:08.837]  We're not going to stop bees from getting on those.
[01:56:08.937 --> 01:56:14.859]  Now, just a final question for you, and I appreciate you joining us, trying to give people the view of how serious all this is.
[01:56:15.279 --> 01:56:24.302]  What do you think, in the next 20 years, the chance is of a weaponized, genetic, even race-specific bioweapon being released?
[01:56:25.719 --> 01:56:26.140]  20 years.
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.203]  I don't know if it'll happen in 20 years.
[01:56:30.263 --> 01:56:36.308]  I think that there will be a biological weapon using genetic engineering technology at some point in the future.
[01:56:36.768 --> 01:56:37.909]  I don't know if it's 20 years.
[01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:40.612]  That's actually not that far away.
[01:56:41.817 --> 01:56:44.960]  It's really hard to know exactly when, 20 years, 30 years.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:47.022]  At some point, that is coming down the pike.
[01:56:47.322 --> 01:56:57.530]  The only thing we can hope on the upside is that researchers who are doing research with genetic engineering techniques will have the means and the technology to be able to... But South Africa successfully produced some of this.
[01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:00.352]  Well, again, everything depends on what you mean.
[01:57:00.492 --> 01:57:06.017]  So there are bioweapons that exist now, but if you're talking about a really sophisticated, genetically engineered...
[01:57:06.457 --> 01:57:08.037]  We're good to go.
[01:57:08.058 --> 01:57:08.478]  We're good to go.
[01:57:08.498 --> 01:57:08.878]  We're good to go.
[01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:34.928]  Alright, well, Doctor, thank you for coming on the broadcast with us.
[01:57:34.988 --> 01:57:35.448]  My pleasure.
[01:57:35.688 --> 01:57:36.109]  Take care.
[01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:36.649]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:36.690 --> 01:57:41.215]  Your call's a ton of news, coming up in just 70 seconds of the third hour.
[01:57:43.697 --> 01:57:43.978]  Hello!
[01:57:43.998 --> 01:57:46.280]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.261 --> 01:57:52.302]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.022 --> 01:57:54.123]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.783 --> 01:57:55.603]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.364 --> 01:57:57.304]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.324 --> 01:58:01.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.107 --> 01:58:06.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.311 --> 01:58:09.811]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:11.492 --> 01:58:15.675]  Let's get ready to rumble!
[01:58:17.596 --> 01:58:18.636]  It is Friday.
[01:58:18.656 --> 01:58:18.736]  TGIF.
[01:58:20.825 --> 01:58:21.945]  We're in the zone.
[01:58:22.065 --> 01:58:26.166]  Final 59 minutes of this transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:27.127 --> 01:58:30.687]  I want to love the phone lines up and take lots of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:30.707 --> 01:58:30.847]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:30.927 --> 01:58:36.809]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:58:36.829 --> 01:58:42.810]  Talking about chimeras, cross-PC stuff going on.
[01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:44.531]  Really dangerous stuff happening.
[01:58:44.911 --> 01:58:48.111]  With just another one of these top scientists who just kind of thinks it's alright.
[01:58:48.151 --> 01:58:50.312]  And he's a friendly guy, so it must all be good.
[01:58:51.075 --> 01:58:54.157]  Well, we need to keep our eyes on it, but we'll be alright.
[01:58:54.217 --> 01:58:56.139]  Interesting interview last hour.
[01:58:56.159 --> 01:58:57.460]  You're welcome to comment on that.
[01:58:58.781 --> 01:59:02.704]  But I want to get back into see-through wall radar.
[01:59:04.705 --> 01:59:06.387]  Could have law enforcement implications.
[01:59:07.968 --> 01:59:09.609]  The police looking through your walls.
[01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.669]  U.S.
[01:59:09.729 --> 01:59:11.430]  edges closer to national ID card.
[01:59:12.791 --> 01:59:13.552]  They always do this.
[01:59:14.665 --> 01:59:19.728]  After they pass something, then they start telling you, well, maybe we just pass a national ID card.
[01:59:19.988 --> 01:59:27.092]  You can call it that if you'd like, but if you want to rationalize it and make excuses for it, if you don't want to face it, maybe it isn't.
[01:59:28.293 --> 01:59:31.134]  And that's the propaganda that makes it so easy to be a slave.
[01:59:32.215 --> 01:59:32.835]  Also, U.S.
[01:59:32.875 --> 01:59:38.098]  terror program recruiting truckers, Associated Press, and that's not all, and it's not just for terror.
[01:59:38.618 --> 01:59:41.780]  North Korea has bought nuclear bomb, ABC News reporting.
[01:59:42.615 --> 01:59:55.641]  And it turns out, well, you do not want to miss this, who they think gave it to them, one of our best little friends as usual, out there engaging in this type of behavior.
[01:59:55.661 --> 02:00:00.604]  And we will also get into, well, China.
[02:00:01.644 --> 02:00:09.028]  Economists are losing faith in the dollar, and if China drops the dollar, we're in big, big trouble.
[02:00:10.089 --> 02:00:11.489]  Big trouble.
[02:00:11.529 --> 02:00:12.510]  And now they're saying U.S.
[02:00:12.570 --> 02:00:17.151]  copter down in Iraq using service-to-air missiles out of the daily dispatch.
[02:00:18.111 --> 02:00:23.112]  And Ashcroft saying a nuke threat is the largest danger to America.
[02:00:23.132 --> 02:00:25.473]  And he's very concerned about that.
[02:00:25.513 --> 02:00:35.895]  But if you give up all of your rights to him or his new buddy, Alberto George Bush is above the log in Zalas, then everything will be all right.
[02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:38.936]  Out of being a slave comes freedom.
[02:00:40.462 --> 02:00:48.125]  Is the new Orwellian situation that we're all basically being sold.
[02:00:49.266 --> 02:01:09.655]  And at the same time, we will get into Russian officers helped in plot to seize Eastland School, Baselon School, London Independent, and as we already knew, flashback Russian school siege bears hallmarks of potential stage PSYOP.
[02:01:10.456 --> 02:01:14.940]  And hey, if our government could pull off Columbine and sell the people, why couldn't Putin?
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:26.649]  And as usual, Putin, who's been caught blowing up his own buildings as a pretext for control, is now more and more evidence pointing directly at government being involved behind that as well.
[02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:30.452]  Blair defends House arrest plan and martial law plan for England.
[02:01:31.272 --> 02:01:32.893]  That is from the BBC.
[02:01:33.314 --> 02:01:38.618]  London Telegraph also reporting behind the rhetoric return of internment camps in Britain.
[02:01:38.738 --> 02:01:39.979]  They're just openly announcing
[02:01:40.569 --> 02:01:41.710]  Concentration camps.
[02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:45.271]  And Gitmo Soldier details sexual tactics.
[02:01:45.311 --> 02:01:52.414]  Associated Press, now Gitmo Soldiers are going public and talking about the sexual pervert behavior.
[02:01:53.115 --> 02:01:58.357]  The torture seems to be all connected to the classic serial killer pervert type activity.
[02:01:58.957 --> 02:02:04.860]  And that's out of the Associated Press, all part of the new Christian conservatism that is sweeping the nation.
[02:02:05.962 --> 02:02:14.267]  And San Francisco bans smoking in public areas, and they're firing people, private corporations are, that smoke in their own time at home.
[02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:19.130]  And draconian terror powers in England aren't just to target terrorists.
[02:02:19.170 --> 02:02:24.033]  London Telegraph, they're to target suspects' families as well.
[02:02:24.553 --> 02:02:26.014]  Or Mad Cow popping up.
[02:02:26.434 --> 02:02:27.895]  Don't worry, the government says it's fine.
[02:02:28.496 --> 02:02:32.118]  So don't worry about that.
[02:02:32.178 --> 02:02:33.859]  Mad Cow disease found in French Goat.
[02:02:35.265 --> 02:02:36.605]  Yeah, it could mean a lot of species.
[02:02:36.625 --> 02:02:38.326]  They don't like you to know about that.
[02:02:39.006 --> 02:02:42.167]  It's all coming up after we take some calls on the other side of this quick break.
[02:02:43.287 --> 02:02:44.968]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.408 --> 02:02:46.908]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.128 --> 02:02:50.209]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.349 --> 02:02:54.250]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:58.551]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:02.632]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.712 --> 02:03:04.593]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:06.094 --> 02:03:12.841]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.001 --> 02:03:16.044]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.224 --> 02:03:19.107]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.567 --> 02:03:25.693]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.213 --> 02:03:27.413]  Go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:03:44.879 --> 02:03:53.485]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:53.725 --> 02:04:04.993]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.013 --> 02:04:07.835]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.195 --> 02:04:14.639]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:14.819 --> 02:04:16.700]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:22.904]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.164 --> 02:04:28.808]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.148 --> 02:04:33.074]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:33.835 --> 02:04:34.516]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.921 --> 02:04:48.303]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:04:48.543 --> 02:04:48.884]  Why?
[02:04:48.904 --> 02:04:51.846]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:04:51.926 --> 02:04:56.849]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:04:56.989 --> 02:05:06.695]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:32.124]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[02:05:32.144 --> 02:05:33.944]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[02:05:46.696 --> 02:05:52.739]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.339 --> 02:05:56.381]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.603 --> 02:06:03.044]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:06:03.124 --> 02:06:04.225]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:06:05.125 --> 02:06:08.527]  We are standing here at a historical crossroads.
[02:06:08.587 --> 02:06:10.688]  I am deeply honored and humbled...
[02:06:12.079 --> 02:06:28.710]  To be your host and to have so many millions of people to tune in, to broadcast on a weekly basis, and to actually know that we're on the vanguard, the cutting edge of fighting dehumanization, and to know that our destiny, that we've been chosen to fight the New World Order.
[02:06:30.511 --> 02:06:35.294]  Come hell or high water, whatever the cost may be, we will defend humanity.
[02:06:35.835 --> 02:06:40.838]  We will stand up for freedom, and we will never, ever surrender.
[02:06:43.648 --> 02:06:46.990]  We'll go to... Oh, who's up first here?
[02:06:47.230 --> 02:06:48.371]  I always do this in the third hour.
[02:06:50.552 --> 02:06:53.333]  Okay, Frank's first out of Ed and Ron and many others.
[02:06:53.373 --> 02:06:54.314]  Full freedom to join us.
[02:06:54.334 --> 02:07:00.417]  1-800-259-9231 Let me be a little bit judicious about this.
[02:07:00.577 --> 02:07:03.279]  Let me try to cover a few articles first.
[02:07:05.039 --> 02:07:09.622]  And then we'll go to your calls so I get all these articles covered before the next 50 minutes.
[02:07:12.153 --> 02:07:13.274]  Well, that's really politically incorrect.
[02:07:13.314 --> 02:07:16.256]  See-through wall radar could have law enforcement applications.
[02:07:35.074 --> 02:07:48.065]  Military researchers are developing a high-tech radar system that can see through walls, locating and tracking hidden enemies, hostage takers, or even avalanche victims buried under mounds of snow.
[02:07:49.746 --> 02:07:51.488]  Canadian, British, and European and U.S.
[02:07:51.528 --> 02:08:01.296]  scientists are racing to perfect the revolutionary 3D technology, which can create images of individuals, detail a room's layout, or even detect buried landmines.
[02:08:01.923 --> 02:08:05.104]  Success could mean millions of dollars in revenues and licensing fees.
[02:08:05.405 --> 02:08:10.487]  In Canada's case, the Defence Research and Development Canada, an agency of the Defence Department.
[02:08:10.927 --> 02:08:18.450]  There's a lot of interest in it, said David de Philpoteau, a civilian researcher in the project's chief scientist.
[02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:23.733]  We're still in the early days, and there are still a lot of technological challenges.
[02:08:23.773 --> 02:08:26.694]  There's still a lot of risk, but that's what R&D is all about.
[02:08:28.086 --> 02:08:34.469]  You know, I love these articles that come out five, six years after the stuff's already in use saying we're developing it.
[02:08:34.489 --> 02:08:35.689]  And the 3D technology.
[02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:40.912]  A vastly scaled back power model of it where it's almost no power.
[02:08:41.772 --> 02:08:43.313]  The systems that look through your clothes.
[02:08:43.333 --> 02:08:45.914]  You've seen the images on TV of the naked woman, the naked man.
[02:08:45.934 --> 02:08:51.256]  I mean, right down to the moles on their skin, to the pores on their skin.
[02:08:51.316 --> 02:08:57.519]  I mean, the vision is crisper than actual what you would see with your binocular vision.
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.841]  In your color binocular vision.
[02:09:00.481 --> 02:09:02.582]  I mean, it's that crisp.
[02:09:02.742 --> 02:09:07.764]  And they can turn it up, and with these systems, the airports even look beneath the skin.
[02:09:09.004 --> 02:09:09.344]  Yes.
[02:09:10.264 --> 02:09:27.651]  But the high-powered systems, I mean, I got Defense Department press releases five years ago where they bragged, oh, in major cities like Chicago, New York, L.A., Houston, a part of a Defense Department program, we've given free ground-by-the-train radar to the helicopters, and the last demonstrations have been on tech TV.
[02:09:28.590 --> 02:09:30.712]  Where it just shows them looking right through your walls.
[02:09:30.772 --> 02:09:39.018]  It's like flying over a house and you see a black and white image of the chairs and the beds and the dining room table and people walking around.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:46.904]  And it's not very crisp, but you can see what's going on quite nicely.
[02:09:48.045 --> 02:09:53.749]  It's kind of like looking at somebody through 20 feet of water or something.
[02:09:54.670 --> 02:09:58.293]  But I guess by perfecting it where it's like super crisp,
[02:09:59.641 --> 02:10:07.168]  But, just, folks, I mean, it's already on these helicopters, and I haven't looked this up in a few years, I would imagine.
[02:10:07.688 --> 02:10:11.111]  I've seen a few articles where the funding's increased and they've put it on some more helicopters.
[02:10:11.432 --> 02:10:20.320]  I don't know how many helicopters they have it on in our cities or how many aircraft, but I know that they said something like 80-something FBI Cessnas have it.
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:21.601]  I just remembered that.
[02:10:21.641 --> 02:10:23.382]  And those are flying around looking for terrorists.
[02:10:24.083 --> 02:10:25.344]  I'm sure they're looking for terrorists, but
[02:10:26.061 --> 02:10:30.703]  You look at all these cases of, quote, fighting terrorism, they then expand out into everything is terrorism.
[02:10:32.984 --> 02:10:36.185]  Here's another case of the government announcing something after it's done.
[02:10:37.026 --> 02:10:37.346]  U.S.
[02:10:37.426 --> 02:10:40.467]  edges closer to national ID card, Knight Ritter newspapers.
[02:10:40.807 --> 02:10:46.189]  The government agents quickens his step, eyeing his subject with great suspicion.
[02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:51.312]  Your papers, please, he asks, extending a hand to accept a government-issued identification.
[02:10:51.332 --> 02:10:52.272]  Hard!
[02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:53.872]  Surreal?
[02:10:53.972 --> 02:10:54.872]  A scene from a movie?
[02:10:55.392 --> 02:10:56.533]  Maybe, and then again.
[02:10:56.553 --> 02:11:06.775]  The United States hedged a step closer towards the idea of a national identification card last month when Congress passed the intelligence reform legislation.
[02:11:07.135 --> 02:11:12.936]  Tucked into the provision was a mandate calling for national regulations for driver's licenses and other forms of identification.
[02:11:13.516 --> 02:11:19.117]  Senator Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who helped grab legislation, is among those who insist the national ID card is not in the works.
[02:11:19.577 --> 02:11:22.118]  Durbin realizes the fear a national ID card ignites.
[02:11:22.617 --> 02:11:24.117]  So this is the new America.
[02:11:26.058 --> 02:11:36.640]  Where they go, being forcibly psychologically tested and forcibly drugged, whether you like it or not, which everyone up to 18 is going to have done to them now, unless we resist, that's not tyranny, that's new freedom!
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:39.241]  And it's the same thing here.
[02:11:40.581 --> 02:11:42.221]  I read the bill on air at least five times.
[02:11:42.281 --> 02:11:43.802]  I had Ron Paul on, congressman.
[02:11:44.202 --> 02:11:45.622]  Tom Tankrio on, congressman.
[02:11:46.728 --> 02:11:47.869]  It is a national ID card.
[02:11:47.909 --> 02:11:50.051]  They already, 42 states already had it.
[02:11:50.091 --> 02:11:53.434]  Last time I checked, it was up to 48 were putting it in, the last six or seven.
[02:11:54.354 --> 02:12:02.140]  And this is a law where every state has the same thumbprint, the same digital photo, the same face scan, and it all hooks already into the federal NCIC.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:03.061]  It was already there.
[02:12:03.401 --> 02:12:04.542]  Now it's just the law.
[02:12:05.023 --> 02:12:06.384]  And it's passed, and they're doing it.
[02:12:08.105 --> 02:12:09.166]  And then a week after that,
[02:12:11.377 --> 02:12:17.964]  Actually, four weeks after that, last week, Ridge runs off to England and gives a big speech, and it's BBC, AP, everywhere.
[02:12:18.304 --> 02:12:19.325]  World ID cards.
[02:12:19.345 --> 02:12:21.427]  We need world identification standards.
[02:12:21.868 --> 02:12:24.250]  All in the same database, which they already set up, called Interpol.
[02:12:25.331 --> 02:12:26.852]  And then Europe announces, and the U.S.
[02:12:26.872 --> 02:12:29.815]  announces, okay, we'll all standardize our passports for the next two months.
[02:12:29.855 --> 02:12:31.077]  And now they're announcing it's going to happen.
[02:12:31.297 --> 02:12:32.598]  And the contracts are out there doing it.
[02:12:33.059 --> 02:12:34.280]  It's just the same thing.
[02:12:36.027 --> 02:12:41.109]  But then when they announce it to you, and again, people argue with me, there'll never be an ID card, I won't put up with it.
[02:12:41.190 --> 02:12:48.713]  I've been telling you, for six, seven years, and I went in and got arrested calling in a national ID card in 97 in my first film, American Destroyed by Design.
[02:12:49.413 --> 02:12:50.374]  And I go in there and I lay out.
[02:12:50.394 --> 02:12:51.795]  This is hooked into the NCIC.
[02:12:51.815 --> 02:12:52.715]  Here's the federal document.
[02:12:52.935 --> 02:12:54.016]  Here's the executive order.
[02:12:54.256 --> 02:12:55.256]  I hold it up to the police.
[02:12:55.356 --> 02:12:57.577]  I hand out hundreds of copies of the DMV.
[02:12:57.778 --> 02:13:00.739]  We have a crowd of over 100 protesters that took it over, basically.
[02:13:03.366 --> 02:13:05.108]  And so we had it then in Texas.
[02:13:05.208 --> 02:13:08.171]  And now it's hooked in at the grocery stores where they put the thumb scanners in.
[02:13:08.191 --> 02:13:09.192]  It goes right into it.
[02:13:09.212 --> 02:13:20.062]  Or when you go to buy a beer or cigarettes at the Diamond Shamrock, you know, and the other gas stations, they swipe your card, even if you're an old man or old lady, and it instantly goes into the state police department.
[02:13:20.262 --> 02:13:22.184]  It's hooked into the feds and checks you for warrants.
[02:13:22.604 --> 02:13:25.227]  Or if it's exempt, they say, sorry!
[02:13:26.596 --> 02:13:27.837]  And soon it's going to be everything.
[02:13:27.877 --> 02:13:30.359]  And, oh, now you want some cold medicine, you've got to do it.
[02:13:30.579 --> 02:13:32.720]  See, and, oh, now it's for the National Sales Tax.
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.602]  And now it's... And people are going to argue with me.
[02:13:35.642 --> 02:13:37.904]  I'm already getting emails going, but you won't call in.
[02:13:38.424 --> 02:13:41.406]  Going, oh, it's not a National ID card.
[02:13:41.426 --> 02:13:44.088]  I mean, they're saying some could call it that.
[02:13:45.169 --> 02:13:47.391]  You'll just have to have it to have a job.
[02:13:47.411 --> 02:13:49.692]  But it's not a National ID card.
[02:13:49.752 --> 02:13:55.156]  And besides, I heard Michael Wiener say on the radio that it's to stop illegal aliens.
[02:13:56.078 --> 02:13:58.098]  The illegal aliens have a waiver in the bill!
[02:14:00.539 --> 02:14:02.339]  Oh, I don't want to rant anymore about this.
[02:14:02.979 --> 02:14:04.680]  Last news article, then I'll go to your calls.
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:07.941]  U.S.
[02:14:07.981 --> 02:14:10.381]  terror program recruiting truckers.
[02:14:10.501 --> 02:14:19.263]  Now, again, Dick Armey left office a couple years ago, and he fought the tips program, and he stood up against it.
[02:14:19.801 --> 02:14:22.702]  So then it was called AmeriCorps as a division of Secure Corps.
[02:14:23.002 --> 02:14:26.683]  So when FEMA has a drill in your town, they'll call it part of the Citizen Corps.
[02:14:26.703 --> 02:14:27.683]  They've got all these different names.
[02:14:28.083 --> 02:14:30.384]  They actually doubled the funding and since then doubled it again.
[02:14:30.424 --> 02:14:33.265]  So I guess it's quadrupled since then, since they got rid of the program.
[02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:35.786]  Like Total Information Awareness as well.
[02:14:35.846 --> 02:14:38.186]  They just doubled that, we've confirmed.
[02:14:38.666 --> 02:14:41.047]  But they changed the name.
[02:14:41.107 --> 02:14:45.088]  So now today, USA Today is reporting on it as well as Associated Press.
[02:14:45.488 --> 02:14:45.788]  U.S.
[02:14:45.828 --> 02:14:47.729]  Terror Program Recruiting Truckers!
[02:14:48.570 --> 02:14:57.614]  And I just so happen to have one of the manuals sent to me a year ago, when the program didn't even supposedly exist, hoping to take advantage of alert eyes along the nation's highways.
[02:14:57.654 --> 02:15:03.857]  The government is trying to enlist more truckers, I guess the 450,000 of last year isn't enough, in the battle against terrorism.
[02:15:04.177 --> 02:15:14.402]  The Alexandria, Virginia-based Highway Watch, started by the American Trucking Association in 98, and funded since 2002, with Homeland Security money, focuses on safety and security.
[02:15:15.487 --> 02:15:19.669]  Spokesman John Willard said the volunteer program has received a total of about 40 million.
[02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:21.970]  All 50 states have active programs now.
[02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:25.191]  He said Highway Watch continues to seek trained members.
[02:15:26.252 --> 02:15:29.653]  And it goes on to say, we fight terror and crime.
[02:15:29.673 --> 02:15:33.395]  And in the manual, you see a man walking on the side of the road with a backpack.
[02:15:33.415 --> 02:15:34.775]  Call the police immediately.
[02:15:35.256 --> 02:15:37.456]  You see a man and woman arguing by a car.
[02:15:38.437 --> 02:15:42.419]  You may not believe that that's illegal, but it's actually verbal abuse.
[02:15:42.459 --> 02:15:43.059]  Call police.
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:47.362]  Do you see someone smoking something that doesn't look like a cigarette in their car?
[02:15:47.662 --> 02:15:48.322]  Call the police.
[02:15:48.642 --> 02:15:51.964]  Do you see someone talking on a cell phone in states where they're prohibited?
[02:15:52.264 --> 02:15:52.964]  Call the police.
[02:15:53.305 --> 02:15:58.887]  I mean, it's not just, you know, crime-type stuff like, if you see a woman tied up in a car, call the police.
[02:15:58.907 --> 02:15:59.908]  That'd be totally reasonable.
[02:16:00.208 --> 02:16:00.588]  But no, no, no.
[02:16:00.608 --> 02:16:04.990]  See, when they do these spy programs, it's always, it's for terrorism, man!
[02:16:06.311 --> 02:16:12.854]  Then the trucking groups get insurance discounts and all this stuff, and they send their truck drivers to these offices.
[02:16:13.610 --> 02:16:23.153]  And then they've let them know that if they've got this card, they're going to be let off a little easier at the weigh stations and at the thing, and they're going to have a rating on their card.
[02:16:23.213 --> 02:16:29.916]  Now they're going to put thumb scanners in all the truck stops where the truck drivers have to thumb scan from point to point to make sure they're not driving while they're tired.
[02:16:31.297 --> 02:16:41.406]  So first they enslave the truck drivers, then make them be little police state minions, and then they're going to have their little ID cards, which is already being implemented, of what type of driver they are, who they've reported.
[02:16:41.606 --> 02:16:51.015]  And so if you're a good little tattletale, oh, you're going to get special treatment, and then only your truck can survive, your business survive, and it's cut through a business, if you're a good little tattletale.
[02:16:53.641 --> 02:16:55.663]  So see, that's like Nazi Germany.
[02:16:55.723 --> 02:16:58.206]  It wasn't just in Nazi Germany that it was a police state.
[02:16:58.406 --> 02:17:00.649]  You had to be part of it to be in business.
[02:17:01.209 --> 02:17:07.796]  And then you could also get your business competition in trouble by reporting on them and doing other things.
[02:17:07.836 --> 02:17:10.019]  So it's just basically everybody tattling on each other and...
[02:17:13.017 --> 02:17:16.039]  It's going to be... Tips is already going on under new names everywhere.
[02:17:16.219 --> 02:17:18.560]  The cable men, the carpet guys, everybody.
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:21.642]  Pell-mell, tattletale, super Nazi society.
[02:17:21.882 --> 02:17:23.322]  Has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:17:23.342 --> 02:17:27.104]  Because they know there's no real terrorism going on.
[02:17:27.124 --> 02:17:32.607]  So it's really all just about getting truck drivers to tag along everyone.
[02:17:33.808 --> 02:17:35.228]  And I don't think truck drivers are stupid.
[02:17:35.268 --> 02:17:36.549]  A lot of them aren't going to go along with it.
[02:17:37.149 --> 02:17:38.370]  And so they're going to be persecuted.
[02:17:39.292 --> 02:17:42.382]  And the Nazis will rise to the top like scum always does.
[02:17:42.763 --> 02:17:43.927]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[02:17:46.503 --> 02:17:52.784]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pets back in your step.
[02:17:52.984 --> 02:17:57.945]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dads, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[02:17:58.165 --> 02:18:11.427]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[02:18:11.667 --> 02:18:14.908]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[02:18:15.188 --> 02:18:17.530]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[02:18:17.730 --> 02:18:21.572]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.

[02:18:28.857 --> 02:18:32.940]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition or just trying to beat the clock?

[02:18:52.708 --> 02:18:55.049]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:20:44.053 --> 02:20:44.613]  Too thin.
[02:20:45.074 --> 02:20:45.834]  Terrorism.
[02:20:45.974 --> 02:20:46.735]  Terrorism.
[02:20:46.835 --> 02:20:47.675]  Chemical attacks.
[02:20:47.735 --> 02:20:48.436]  Dirty bombs.
[02:20:48.496 --> 02:20:48.936]  Fallout.
[02:20:48.996 --> 02:20:49.997]  Biological attack.
[02:20:50.177 --> 02:20:50.717]  Anthrax.
[02:20:50.777 --> 02:20:52.918]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:20:53.159 --> 02:20:54.780]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:57.481]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:20:57.862 --> 02:21:10.009]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases,
[02:21:10.009 --> 02:21:10.730]  We're good to go.
[02:21:25.928 --> 02:21:32.652]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:21:32.712 --> 02:21:35.434]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:21:35.474 --> 02:21:36.514]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:36.534 --> 02:21:37.755]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.737 --> 02:21:59.158]  All right, let's go to the calls.
[02:21:59.358 --> 02:22:01.400]  Frank in Louisiana.
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:03.381]  It's home country down there.
[02:22:03.761 --> 02:22:05.122]  What's going on, Frank?
[02:22:05.662 --> 02:22:09.145]  Oh, we're just enjoying the cool weather down here and whatnot.
[02:22:09.185 --> 02:22:13.508]  But, Alex, last week I saw something very disturbing.
[02:22:14.268 --> 02:22:23.414]  They had the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and they had the same old worn-out expressions of never again.
[02:22:23.454 --> 02:22:26.196]  And whenever they say that, it aggravates me because I said, you know,
[02:22:27.948 --> 02:22:33.892]  America's baby extermination camps have literally dwarfed what they did in the Third Reich.
[02:22:34.273 --> 02:22:36.574]  Isn't it over like 54 million right now?
[02:22:36.795 --> 02:22:41.418]  My figures have told me it's probably somewhere between 70 and 80 million.
[02:22:41.938 --> 02:22:44.300]  But they admit it's 54 million as of last year.
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:45.361]  I haven't seen the numbers lately.
[02:22:47.995 --> 02:22:52.979]  No, and Stalin killed 50 million, Mao killed 60 million, and it's never discussed.
[02:22:53.059 --> 02:22:54.680]  And, I mean, frankly, I'm tired of it.
[02:22:54.981 --> 02:23:11.794]  Well, the thing about it is, you know, Elie Wiesel is a very suspicious character, but I was thinking of the analogies, and you talked about it earlier before this last break, and it was perfect because, you know, the Nazis had war after war, enemy after enemy,
[02:23:12.592 --> 02:23:16.757]  And they justified it by establishing everything was done for the fatherland.
[02:23:16.977 --> 02:23:18.198]  Everything was the fatherland.
[02:23:18.899 --> 02:23:21.842]  They implemented gun control, which our 1968 gun control laws
[02:23:23.976 --> 02:23:26.016]  You know, I understand we're taking word for word.
[02:23:26.056 --> 02:23:27.737]  They're an exact translation.
[02:23:27.777 --> 02:23:33.518]  I even have the letter from the Library of Congress for Senator Dodd, the late Senator Dodd, not the current one.
[02:23:34.058 --> 02:23:36.678]  And it's word for word, a translation.
[02:23:36.738 --> 02:23:37.738]  Two words are changed.
[02:23:38.299 --> 02:23:47.320]  And the Nazis, Hitler, like the Marxists in the East, set up the Christian church, the state church.
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:49.020]  Hitler called his the Reich Church.
[02:23:49.681 --> 02:23:52.201]  Jara wrote about it in the rise and fall of the Third Reich.
[02:23:52.901 --> 02:23:57.043]  And any church that didn't follow orders, they were sent to the concentration camps.
[02:23:57.103 --> 02:24:05.427]  Well, now we're going to have our new patriotic church under New Freedom Initiative, and Hillary has just endorsed it, so it must be good.
[02:24:05.647 --> 02:24:06.708]  Well, it's a 501c3.
[02:24:06.808 --> 02:24:13.371]  It's a state church, so anybody who says on the left, we need a separation of church and state, say, you're full of baloney.
[02:24:13.391 --> 02:24:15.852]  We've been having this for decades, and you don't say anything about it.
[02:24:16.713 --> 02:24:19.194]  And then they had the child schools, the Hitler Youth Program.
[02:24:19.966 --> 02:24:32.690]  Where, when the Americans liberated Germany, they said that those children were so ignorant, were so illiterate, were so indoctrinated in Nazi history, that it was amazing that these children were so dumb.
[02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:39.333]  And now we have changed our public schools into government schools, which is the tenth plank of the Communist Manifesto.
[02:24:39.853 --> 02:24:45.735]  And the funny thing about it, or even the sicker thing about it, is that the Gellig Org, the Gellin Org,
[02:24:46.448 --> 02:24:49.850]  Named after Reinhard Gellin, who predated the SS Nazis.
[02:24:50.410 --> 02:24:56.433]  He was part of the German intelligence, the Adwur, Adwur, I think they called it, yes.
[02:24:57.213 --> 02:25:02.736]  And it was in Operation Sunshine that they took these same Nazis and put them into the U.S.
[02:25:02.756 --> 02:25:11.560]  spy service, with Alan Dulles writing a letter persuading Truman to take on the Gellin Org on Gellin's own terms.
[02:25:12.261 --> 02:25:15.162]  And what they did was everything they did in Nazi Germany,
[02:25:15.836 --> 02:25:16.821]  They did in America.
[02:25:17.021 --> 02:25:20.396]  Well, let's just give our rights up to the government and everything will be alright.
[02:25:20.677 --> 02:25:21.039]  Oh, yes.
[02:25:21.917 --> 02:25:26.378]  But they were financed by the same identical banking trust out of New York and other places.
[02:25:26.438 --> 02:25:28.658]  The Rockefeller interests were all over the place.
[02:25:29.078 --> 02:25:34.279]  No, no, that's the thing, is that, you know, when you talk about Rothschilds or somebody, they'll say you're being anti-Semitic.
[02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:35.920]  How are they even Jews?
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:38.240]  I mean, every time we catch them, they're funding Nazis.
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:39.601]  They're not, the people aren't Jews.
[02:25:39.841 --> 02:25:40.641]  Well, not only that.
[02:25:40.681 --> 02:25:41.521]  They just hide behind that.
[02:25:41.821 --> 02:25:46.942]  Not only that, but, you know, I know that you're pro-Semitic, I'm pro-Semitic, I'm pro-human being.
[02:25:48.085 --> 02:25:56.369]  Well, I'm pro-anybody, and the point is, it's like you've got phony Christians, you've got phony Jews, you've got phony black people, whatever.
[02:25:56.409 --> 02:26:04.313]  You've got evil people, and they all hide behind these group names, and then get the group a lot of times to follow them, thinking they're supporting them, when they're really slitting their throats.
[02:26:04.553 --> 02:26:06.033]  That's exactly what's happening.
[02:26:06.154 --> 02:26:11.296]  I mean, you know, when they set up the Marxist welfare plantation, it was a control mechanism.
[02:26:12.066 --> 02:26:12.826]  And now look at it.
[02:26:12.866 --> 02:26:13.707]  Your child's overweight.
[02:26:13.727 --> 02:26:14.667]  They're going to take them from you.
[02:26:14.687 --> 02:26:16.528]  Your child draws a stick figure with a sword.
[02:26:16.548 --> 02:26:17.788]  They're going to take them from you.
[02:26:18.109 --> 02:26:19.529]  I mean, it's a hellish system, man.
[02:26:19.569 --> 02:26:20.610]  They are building a nightmare.
[02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:21.190]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:21.370 --> 02:26:21.790]  Okay, buddy.
[02:26:21.810 --> 02:26:22.450]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:23.131]  Ed in Utah.
[02:26:23.151 --> 02:26:23.651]  You're on the air.
[02:26:23.691 --> 02:26:24.231]  Go ahead, Ed.
[02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:26.832]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:26:26.852 --> 02:26:33.435]  Listen, I want to follow up on just what you were saying there about different camps and different things coming.
[02:26:33.815 --> 02:26:35.596]  I have a comment on Mikhail Chertoff.
[02:26:36.474 --> 02:26:40.315]  I know you discussed him a little bit, the Homeland Security Secretary now under Bush.
[02:26:40.515 --> 02:26:41.755]  Yeah, Mikhail Chertov, yeah.
[02:26:41.875 --> 02:26:42.596]  Yeah, Mikhail.
[02:26:43.256 --> 02:26:49.598]  The thing of it is, Alex, it's interesting you brought up the Israeli factor here, or your previous caller did.
[02:26:50.818 --> 02:26:54.759]  I do want to say this, that one of his targets was David Duke.
[02:26:55.479 --> 02:26:58.322]  And one of his rewards, of course, was to get a federal judgeship.
[02:26:58.342 --> 02:27:08.010]  He went after both Jim Traficant and David Duke as a federal prosecutor, but he's also the official that released 140 Israeli Massan spies in the days after 9-11.
[02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:12.654]  Excuse me, it took him a couple months to get the clearance from Ashcroft to do this.
[02:27:13.054 --> 02:27:18.759]  But the reason I bring this up is that David Duke, in his book Jewish Supremacism,
[02:27:19.415 --> 02:27:30.566]  Talks about how immoral it is that we harp only on the Jewish suffering from World War II and forget what you just pointed out, the 50 million Christian peasants slaughtered by Jewish Bolsheviks.
[02:27:30.906 --> 02:27:31.827]  Well, hold on.
[02:27:31.847 --> 02:27:33.209]  We'll have to talk about this after the break.
[02:27:35.951 --> 02:27:36.872]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.353 --> 02:27:38.954]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.974 --> 02:27:42.558]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:47.040]  We're good to go.
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:47.481]  We're good to go.
[02:28:06.189 --> 02:28:06.829]  We're good to go.
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:26.281]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:49.405]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:49.445 --> 02:28:49.965]  are located?

[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:02.461]  Look, I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[02:31:02.481 --> 02:31:05.344]  And we're going to go back to Ed in just a second.
[02:31:06.565 --> 02:31:14.891]  I think it's very destructive to constantly say that the New World Order is a Jewish conspiracy.
[02:31:16.492 --> 02:31:19.474]  Certainly there are Jews in the New World Order.
[02:31:21.796 --> 02:31:24.738]  And there are many other groups in the New World Order.
[02:31:24.778 --> 02:31:26.640]  There are organized crime syndicates.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:29.522]  And so I look at it as crime syndicates.
[02:31:30.262 --> 02:31:36.964]  And crime syndicates normally congeal around racial lines, or ethnic lines, or regional lines.
[02:31:38.244 --> 02:31:46.826]  And so, people have gotten pretty good that back when we were criticizing the Chinese mafia in this country, there were actually big TV, you know, Dateline Tonight.
[02:31:47.566 --> 02:31:52.867]  It was a backlash against Chinese immigrants and supposed triad gangs, racist.
[02:31:53.588 --> 02:31:55.288]  Well, no, I'm not against Chinese people.
[02:31:55.388 --> 02:31:56.828]  I'm against Chinese mafia.
[02:31:57.368 --> 02:31:59.549]  And there is a Jewish mafia, and it's big.
[02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:13.556]  Just like there's an Italian mafia that's big, and they're both dwarfed by the good old boy wasp mob that Tony Montana talks about at Scarface.
[02:32:15.297 --> 02:32:20.419]  It's actually pretty accurate when he says he's watching a TV ad for a bank.
[02:32:20.499 --> 02:32:24.581]  It's a big bank he's laundered money in, but it's how loving and conservative the bank is.
[02:32:24.621 --> 02:32:25.581]  He goes, they're the ones.
[02:32:25.641 --> 02:32:26.582]  That's the real mob.
[02:32:26.922 --> 02:32:29.823]  But it's such a big mob that it's the establishment.
[02:32:30.922 --> 02:32:36.723]  And then whenever they want to burn a mafia that's been cutting in on their territory, they'll put some heat on it.
[02:32:36.743 --> 02:32:41.565]  You know, the Italian mob started getting really big and becoming one of the most powerful in the 40s.
[02:32:41.765 --> 02:32:47.786]  So the newspapers just talked about them and exposed them, and the G-men went in and broke a lot of them up, and the Italian mob today is a joke.
[02:32:48.786 --> 02:32:51.067]  I mean, the Asian mob is much bigger.
[02:32:52.167 --> 02:32:54.968]  The Chinese mob alone is much bigger than the Italian mob.
[02:32:54.988 --> 02:32:56.188]  The Italian mob is a joke.
[02:32:56.808 --> 02:32:57.668]  It is a joke.
[02:32:58.649 --> 02:32:59.849]  The Jewish mafia, though...
[02:33:00.701 --> 02:33:08.043]  Has been slicker, and not as apt to go around killing each other, and having wars, and it's quite large.
[02:33:08.103 --> 02:33:09.603]  And I'll talk about the Jewish Mafia all day.
[02:33:09.623 --> 02:33:13.604]  I mean, I'll have Jewish writers on with, you know, Pulitzer Prize winning books about the Jewish Mafia.
[02:33:14.344 --> 02:33:17.284]  And if you talk about the Jewish Mafia, you know, the ADL come out and attack you.
[02:33:17.304 --> 02:33:19.445]  And it's basically their job is protecting the Jewish Mafia.
[02:33:20.945 --> 02:33:23.666]  You know, and endorsing Arnold Schwarzenegger, a confirmed Nazi.
[02:33:23.706 --> 02:33:24.806]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:33:25.746 --> 02:33:29.627]  And then every time I research Rothschilds or any of these so-called big Jewish families...
[02:33:30.462 --> 02:33:33.404]  I mean, they're totally into the occult, totally into Nazism.
[02:33:33.424 --> 02:33:34.846]  They're not Jews, folks.
[02:33:35.246 --> 02:33:37.668]  The Bible says, beware of those who call themselves Jews that are not.
[02:33:37.948 --> 02:33:44.233]  And then a lot of good Jews look at those groups and think, oh, they say they're Jewish, then that must be a Jewish group, so I better defend them.
[02:33:44.253 --> 02:33:52.379]  And no, it's like good conservatives defending the Republican Party and the Bush family, which is one of the biggest crime families in the country.
[02:33:52.959 --> 02:33:55.942]  And when you attack them, it's, oh, you just don't like...
[02:33:57.674 --> 02:33:59.095]  You just don't like the Bushes.
[02:33:59.455 --> 02:34:00.575]  You don't like Republicans.
[02:34:01.235 --> 02:34:09.178]  I had one newspaper reporter I had dinner with about a month ago, actually go, you're a liberal and you don't like white people.
[02:34:09.198 --> 02:34:12.039]  And I said, and she was a white lady, and I go, what are you talking about?
[02:34:12.059 --> 02:34:13.719]  I'm talking about how the Republicans have been taken over.
[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:15.120]  That's how they see it.
[02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:15.860]  It's like tribal.
[02:34:16.140 --> 02:34:19.141]  My tribe is the Republicans, and you're attacking my tribe.
[02:34:19.861 --> 02:34:24.203]  And then, you know, when I said I'm sick of it,
[02:34:25.607 --> 02:34:28.888]  I am sick of them covering up for how many people the Bolsheviks killed.
[02:34:29.528 --> 02:34:30.228]  I'm sick of them.
[02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:33.729]  I'm not sick of hearing about how Hitler was bad and how he killed people.
[02:34:33.930 --> 02:34:35.270]  Folks, he was into the occult.
[02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:36.870]  He was a devil worshiper.
[02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:38.291]  I've got his own writing.
[02:34:38.331 --> 02:34:39.491]  This guy was bad news.
[02:34:39.731 --> 02:34:40.992]  Just look at him.
[02:34:41.172 --> 02:34:43.272]  Look at all the symbols.
[02:34:43.532 --> 02:34:45.733]  It's the tool society, the fool society.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:49.541]  And then people like David Duke and others come out defending Hitler.
[02:34:50.581 --> 02:34:51.642]  It's out of control.
[02:34:52.522 --> 02:34:53.202]  It's a fraud.
[02:34:53.522 --> 02:35:00.204]  Just because some other group is corrupt doesn't mean you then race over to the other extreme of a Germanic death cult mafia.
[02:35:01.024 --> 02:35:05.966]  And I'm sick of the cover-ups about how many people communists killed.
[02:35:06.006 --> 02:35:12.128]  It wasn't Jews in China that killed 60 million of their own people.
[02:35:13.188 --> 02:35:14.008]  And what you raise...
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:18.542]  Because I want to be honest about this, Ed.
[02:35:19.323 --> 02:35:24.648]  One part you raise about this is there were prominent Jews or people who had some Jewish blood.
[02:35:24.668 --> 02:35:30.733]  I mean, they would use it as a political tool when they needed to and then deny it when they didn't want it or they would also then persecute Jews.
[02:35:30.773 --> 02:35:31.574]  So, I don't know.
[02:35:31.834 --> 02:35:40.362]  The Russian Revolution and what happened over the next 60 years is Jews killing people, purges of Jews being killed, Stalin going after Jews.
[02:35:41.643 --> 02:35:42.183]  I don't know.
[02:35:42.263 --> 02:35:48.048]  So when you say Jews killing 50 million, I think that's distorted.
[02:35:48.448 --> 02:35:49.469]  Were there Jews in it?
[02:35:49.589 --> 02:35:49.869]  Yes.
[02:35:50.269 --> 02:35:53.772]  But it's the normal M.O., Jews killing Jews, as well as Christians.
[02:35:53.792 --> 02:35:54.573]  Do you have any comments?
[02:35:55.353 --> 02:35:55.553]  Alex?
[02:35:57.075 --> 02:35:58.075]  I'm on still, am I?
[02:35:58.296 --> 02:35:58.876]  Yes, you are.
[02:35:58.996 --> 02:35:59.957]  Okay, Red China.
[02:36:00.958 --> 02:36:11.942]  Your friends like Ted Gunderson, FBI man, and Michael Piper at the American Free Press newspaper in Washington have made the point about red China and the long-standing secret relationship with the Israelis.
[02:36:12.022 --> 02:36:12.882]  Oh, that's true.
[02:36:12.922 --> 02:36:14.043]  The Israelis are horrible.
[02:36:14.363 --> 02:36:15.643]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[02:36:15.883 --> 02:36:20.125]  Weapons to Pakistan has now given them to North Korea, but so has the U.S.
[02:36:20.145 --> 02:36:21.445]  government, so has the British government.
[02:36:21.545 --> 02:36:22.365]  They're all bad.
[02:36:22.966 --> 02:36:24.186]  But look, here's the thing.
[02:36:24.546 --> 02:36:29.071]  If we just single the Jews out, then the whole anti-Semitic argument comes out.
[02:36:29.131 --> 02:36:30.272]  Plus, it isn't true, sir.
[02:36:30.432 --> 02:36:31.213]  I really looked at it.
[02:36:31.413 --> 02:36:32.394]  Did you know that British...
[02:36:33.132 --> 02:36:38.237]  Families with no Jewish last names are the majority owners of American stock.
[02:36:38.397 --> 02:36:39.599]  It is British families.
[02:36:39.839 --> 02:36:40.900]  It is not Jews.
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:43.222]  Do they have some Jews as front men?
[02:36:43.262 --> 02:36:43.603]  Yes.
[02:36:43.783 --> 02:36:45.504]  Yes, and that's part of the thing.
[02:36:45.625 --> 02:36:47.286]  And here's where the crux I'm coming to.
[02:36:47.566 --> 02:36:52.171]  One of the things that you've done very well, and Alex, we're all on your side on this, on the 9-11.
[02:36:52.471 --> 02:36:55.915]  When you look at the fact that the Bronfman's longtime friend and...
[02:36:56.355 --> 02:36:57.276]  But it's like this.
[02:36:57.296 --> 02:36:57.876]  But it's like this.
[02:36:57.896 --> 02:36:58.357]  But it's like this.
[02:37:16.343 --> 02:37:19.026]  In Texas, 50 years ago, the German mob was big.
[02:37:19.967 --> 02:37:21.508]  The German mob, very small.
[02:37:22.149 --> 02:37:26.052]  The wasp mob's big, but particularly the German mafia.
[02:37:26.372 --> 02:37:31.998]  And it was just in prostitution and gaming and illegal booze.
[02:37:32.478 --> 02:37:34.501]  But the German mob was big in Texas.
[02:37:34.781 --> 02:37:41.109]  Well, if a German goes out and shoots somebody who didn't pay them, that isn't because Germans are bad.
[02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:44.172]  Germans aren't bad because Hitler was bad.
[02:37:44.553 --> 02:37:51.862]  Look, I'm telling you, if you want to be effective and want to fight the Jewish mafia, which I think is admirable, then fight all the mafias.
[02:37:52.182 --> 02:37:53.562]  Well, last point on this.
[02:37:53.783 --> 02:37:56.803]  We've heard so much over the years about German perfidy.
[02:37:57.143 --> 02:38:05.446]  We need to hear about these people, like wolf and sheepskin, what they have been doing, and that's why I brought up... But certainly you know there were purges by the Soviets of Jews.
[02:38:05.566 --> 02:38:07.887]  Yeah, but I realize that... Well, then explain that to me.
[02:38:07.907 --> 02:38:08.907]  I don't understand.
[02:38:09.027 --> 02:38:15.909]  And here's my point, though, Alex, is that we need to look at the perfidy involved not only with the banksters...
[02:38:16.509 --> 02:38:17.290]  We're good to go.
[02:38:17.310 --> 02:38:17.810]  We're good to go.
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:49.106]  And that's why I brought up David Duke's book, Jewish Supremacism, which does a historical overview over the last hundred years.
[02:38:49.126 --> 02:38:49.586]  Listen to me.
[02:38:50.807 --> 02:38:52.188]  I don't like David Duke.
[02:38:53.329 --> 02:38:57.112]  I don't like the Ku Klux Klan, a satanic, masonic organization.
[02:38:57.812 --> 02:39:01.375]  And I have read writings of Duke where he is an apologist for Hitler.
[02:39:01.755 --> 02:39:04.217]  Hitler was a devil worshiper.
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:12.882]  Do you understand that the same societies that were in Germany founded Skull and Bones here in this country?
[02:39:13.082 --> 02:39:15.802]  I understand.
[02:39:16.022 --> 02:39:20.744]  It's true that Bush has some Jews in his cabinet and people that say they're Jews who are evil.
[02:39:21.144 --> 02:39:26.385]  But in his core, Bush is devil worship.
[02:39:26.945 --> 02:39:27.905]  It's not Jews.
[02:39:27.965 --> 02:39:28.906]  It's not Germans.
[02:39:29.006 --> 02:39:29.926]  It's devil worship.
[02:39:30.246 --> 02:39:33.827]  I realize that, Alex, but I'm just hoping that as part of the food for thought here...
[02:39:34.867 --> 02:39:42.669]  I don't like Ted Kennedy at all, but he's right about this war and his comments today, and they're causing consternation for big old Rush Limbaugh.
[02:39:42.909 --> 02:39:55.312]  But when you look at ABC, who Rush Limbaugh truly works for, and the Fox News Network, where they got their money from, the Bronsons, it goes back to your Jewish mafia that you talked about, and that Michael Piper... Well, you know, the Bronsons have basically lost control of everything.
[02:39:56.903 --> 02:39:57.603]  Well, Levinson's their CEO.
[02:39:57.623 --> 02:39:58.024]  He doesn't own it.
[02:40:17.052 --> 02:40:30.824]  Well, the fact is that on the Board of Directors, Levinson is the CEO, but when you look at the total Board of Directors and where the money comes from, that's why I'm saying if you go to Dun & Bradstreet... I think if you look at the Board of Directors, you're going to find it's British money.
[02:40:31.224 --> 02:40:35.007]  Well, you can talk about British banks, and that is fair to think.
[02:40:35.047 --> 02:40:36.028]  That's another thing.
[02:40:36.128 --> 02:40:37.229]  Look, I don't think...
[02:40:38.118 --> 02:40:40.459]  I mean, it's a joke, sir.
[02:40:40.479 --> 02:40:43.881]  You look at Lord Rothschild, who is really at the top of the pyramid of the New World War.
[02:40:44.321 --> 02:40:46.442]  He can prance around saying he's Jewish all day.
[02:40:46.862 --> 02:40:54.846]  The guy's got blue eyes, he has no so-called Semitic characteristics, and their family clearly funded Hitler.
[02:40:56.547 --> 02:41:02.750]  The problem is that Jews, real Jews, support these people, and they shouldn't.
[02:41:03.524 --> 02:41:05.527]  Okay, but they're not Jews, sir.
[02:41:05.567 --> 02:41:08.931]  They may not be, Alex, but the point is that that's the name they're going by.
[02:41:08.951 --> 02:41:10.893]  That is the movement that they have started.
[02:41:11.133 --> 02:41:13.156]  And their banks do control the U.S.
[02:41:13.216 --> 02:41:13.556]  media.
[02:41:13.576 --> 02:41:17.821]  Sumner Redstone owns 77% of the stocks of the CBS Viacom network.
[02:41:18.202 --> 02:41:22.567]  And what is important is that most Americans don't even know this fact.
[02:41:23.067 --> 02:41:24.528]  It is essentially foreign-owned.
[02:41:24.748 --> 02:41:32.893]  Pat Buchanan, during the last Gulf War, said that there are two groups that wanted this war, the Israeli Defense Ministry and their Amen Corner here in the United States.
[02:41:32.953 --> 02:41:33.313]  Oh, yeah?
[02:41:33.333 --> 02:41:35.434]  Well, you know, that's the weird thing about Buchanan.
[02:41:35.674 --> 02:41:38.156]  He's suddenly been for these wars, then he's against them.
[02:41:38.636 --> 02:41:39.757]  Talk about flip-flopping.
[02:41:39.777 --> 02:41:40.777]  Look, I appreciate the call.
[02:41:41.077 --> 02:41:41.758]  I appreciate the call.
[02:41:41.778 --> 02:41:47.381]  I want to take a few more and get to some news, but I just... Folks, I saw a great article on the web about this.
[02:41:48.061 --> 02:41:51.183]  It is... Listen, if anybody has any respect for me,
[02:41:53.175 --> 02:41:55.757]  I'm tired of being called an Israeli apologist.
[02:41:56.357 --> 02:41:56.677]  Okay?
[02:41:57.097 --> 02:41:57.798]  I'm tired of it.
[02:41:59.339 --> 02:42:03.041]  And I literally tell the truth as best I know it.
[02:42:03.141 --> 02:42:03.921]  I research it.
[02:42:04.282 --> 02:42:04.962]  I study it.
[02:42:05.722 --> 02:42:09.044]  I have read so many history books from so many different angles.
[02:42:09.264 --> 02:42:10.885]  I understand the history of this thing.
[02:42:11.706 --> 02:42:16.489]  And it really is, the New World Order is extremely sophisticated.
[02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:22.232]  And if you read the Bible, you understand this.
[02:42:22.895 --> 02:42:27.496]  And you understand that the devil hates God's people.
[02:42:29.256 --> 02:42:32.077]  And Christ came, and so we're all God's people now.
[02:42:32.137 --> 02:42:36.017]  But the point is that I am a Christian.
[02:42:36.977 --> 02:42:41.358]  And when I see the phony neocon church saying, Worship Israel.
[02:42:41.438 --> 02:42:42.558]  Israel can do no wrong.
[02:42:43.018 --> 02:42:44.839]  Go along with what they say or you're cursed.
[02:42:45.199 --> 02:42:51.660]  Then I read the prophets, all who are rebuking Israel for being wrong and being bad and being involved in evil and Israel being judged.
[02:42:52.776 --> 02:42:56.160]  So I don't go with this whole view that Israel's perfect and Israel's this and Israel's that.
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:43:07.815]  But I know that the devil and his forces have focused on the Jews and have been very good at getting control of so-called leaders so that, just like it happened thousands of years ago, so they can lead them astray.
[02:43:08.832 --> 02:43:14.175]  And so we should be able to criticize Israel and criticize what they're doing and talk about what they're doing that is bad.
[02:43:14.635 --> 02:43:19.297]  But at the same time, then, I don't throw myself in to support of the Muslims.
[02:43:19.797 --> 02:43:27.581]  Where if I went to Saudi Arabia and walked outside one of the compounds at night, this is 20 years ago, and today as well, I'll be shot.
[02:43:28.361 --> 02:43:30.322]  I mean, they really do hate Westerners.
[02:43:30.843 --> 02:43:32.043]  They really do.
[02:43:32.904 --> 02:43:35.565]  You talk about tribalism, organized crime.
[02:43:36.894 --> 02:43:40.515]  Now, I don't subscribe that all Arabs are bad and hate Westerners and hate Christians.
[02:43:40.555 --> 02:43:41.215]  That's not true.
[02:43:42.296 --> 02:43:47.237]  You know, the Jordanians have a great history of tolerance and being nice.
[02:43:47.938 --> 02:43:49.218]  Frankly, the Palestinians did.
[02:43:51.139 --> 02:43:52.099]  Iraqis did.
[02:43:52.219 --> 02:43:53.039]  No, not anymore.
[02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:56.821]  But I see our government loving the worst Muslim countries out there.
[02:43:56.981 --> 02:44:03.643]  Look, it's just, you know, I had the ADL attack me for absolutely no reason.
[02:44:04.871 --> 02:44:07.452]  And I've, you know, threatened to sue them, and they've taken some stuff down before.
[02:44:07.492 --> 02:44:09.733]  But, I mean, they don't even say I'm anti-Semitic.
[02:44:09.753 --> 02:44:14.554]  They just put me mixed in with all these, you know, really unsavory people on their website.
[02:44:14.655 --> 02:44:21.277]  And then I had, and then I get these emails, you know, hey, Jew boy, you know, we're going to kill you.
[02:44:21.317 --> 02:44:25.818]  When I came out against Arnold, I got lots of emails going, how Hitler, we're going to get you.
[02:44:27.199 --> 02:44:29.860]  You know, it's sick.
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:30.500]  It's sick.
[02:44:32.446 --> 02:44:34.347]  But listen, I will talk about the Jewish Mafia.
[02:44:34.407 --> 02:44:35.687]  I will talk about the Italian Mafia.
[02:44:35.727 --> 02:44:37.088]  I will talk about the WASP Mafia.
[02:44:37.588 --> 02:44:39.088]  And I'll discuss this.
[02:44:39.108 --> 02:44:46.870]  But if you go back to medieval times, and you research what happened, the royalty was very, very smart.
[02:44:48.491 --> 02:44:52.452]  And very, very sophisticated.
[02:44:52.472 --> 02:44:58.594]  And they would not allow banking, but they would then license it directly to Jews.
[02:44:59.798 --> 02:45:07.761]  And the argument was, you're not allowed to bank, and you're not allowed to be anything but a Christian, but Jews are kind of in between.
[02:45:07.841 --> 02:45:10.942]  They can be in our country because they're not really Christian.
[02:45:10.962 --> 02:45:12.923]  This is during the Middle Ages, Dark Ages even.
[02:45:13.723 --> 02:45:19.585]  Even though they're not Christian, they're of the same cloth, and so we're going to let them be here, and we're going to let them engage in banking.
[02:45:21.306 --> 02:45:26.128]  And then every few years, in some new country, the king would just decide to take their money.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.922]  And then later the Templars got into banking, and they had their money taken.
[02:45:32.203 --> 02:45:37.105]  And then so you kind of had an allied thing between some of the Jews and the Templars, and all this stuff goes on.
[02:45:38.086 --> 02:45:39.406]  But, I mean, that's just history.
[02:45:40.307 --> 02:45:50.512]  But it's just the scapegoating is really ingrained and deeply inculcated into our societies.
[02:45:51.244 --> 02:46:01.268]  And the sooner we get past it and just say we're against evil policies and we're against organized crime, and the sooner we stand up against it, the sooner we're going to be able to defeat it.
[02:46:01.888 --> 02:46:11.592]  But so much of the energies are spent by a minority of activists out there just beating their heads up against the wall, Israel, Israel, Israel, and it's not going anywhere.
[02:46:12.932 --> 02:46:24.275]  And, you know, most Jews are good people, just like most, you know, Chinese are good people, or most Germans are good people, and they just sit there and think you don't like them, and they run off and join the New World Order thinking it must be good.
[02:46:24.576 --> 02:46:29.537]  Why, if you're attacking the New World Order and saying, you know, the Jews are bad, well, then the New World Order must be good.
[02:46:29.597 --> 02:46:33.638]  And they go, see, it's so sophisticated, and I have trouble articulating it.
[02:46:33.818 --> 02:46:36.279]  Up next is, who's up next here?
[02:46:38.297 --> 02:46:40.639]  Kyle in Colorado, and then Luis in KC.
[02:46:40.659 --> 02:46:41.360]  That's all I'm taking.
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:42.861]  Kyle in Colorado, go ahead.
[02:46:43.222 --> 02:46:43.822]  Greetings, sir.
[02:46:45.003 --> 02:46:47.706]  If I may, I'd like to change the subject and go back to what you're talking about.
[02:46:47.726 --> 02:46:48.607]  Yeah, please, please do.
[02:46:49.828 --> 02:46:56.254]  I have a brief story about chimeras and the biological testing and biological engineering.
[02:46:57.795 --> 02:47:04.101]  The doctor was very fascinated with what he was talking about, but I have to disagree with his timeline and what he said was actual progress being made.
[02:47:05.218 --> 02:47:06.219]  I'm an electrical engineer.
[02:47:06.239 --> 02:47:10.122]  I've been in electronics and broadcast engineering for over 30 years.
[02:47:10.643 --> 02:47:18.729]  About 20 years ago, it was either 1980 or 1981, I was on a field trip down to Los Angeles and was staying in a hotel in Hollywood.
[02:47:19.189 --> 02:47:28.336]  They had a local channel origination news broadcast or news program, like when they highlight certain industries and certain corporations and companies upcoming.
[02:47:28.917 --> 02:47:30.458]  And this was their technological segment.
[02:47:30.838 --> 02:47:33.020]  And they had highlighted a local channel
[02:47:33.499 --> 02:47:37.760]  Biomedical engineering company down there in Los Angeles or near to Hollywood.
[02:47:38.761 --> 02:47:47.084]  In that, they took them through the entire lab and were showing the cryogenics and the chambers for growing the budding embryos and the
[02:47:48.677 --> 02:47:59.665]  The person who was their personnel, well, not personnel, but the, what do you call it, the gal that does all the news presentations for the company, the PR gal, thank you, sir.
[02:48:00.646 --> 02:48:06.790]  She was going into great depth because she was, I guess, one of their affiliate engineers, biomedical engineer.
[02:48:07.311 --> 02:48:11.874]  And she was going on and on about what kind of progress they had made.
[02:48:12.875 --> 02:48:16.077]  And the gal that was the representative for that representative was telling me,
[02:48:16.690 --> 02:48:21.133]  The newscaster, how interesting it was that they were having... Sorry, do we need to hold?
[02:48:21.153 --> 02:48:23.114]  Yeah, I was just listening to you.
[02:48:23.154 --> 02:48:23.514]  No, no, no.
[02:48:23.974 --> 02:48:26.055]  It's all decades more advanced than what they tell you.
[02:48:26.075 --> 02:48:27.296]  And now they're admitting all this is happening.
[02:48:27.836 --> 02:48:30.118]  That professor we had on was playing word games.
[02:48:30.818 --> 02:48:33.139]  He was talking about certain types of chimeras.
[02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:35.180]  And I caught him doing that.
[02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:36.221]  But tell you what, stay there.
[02:48:36.241 --> 02:48:37.182]  We'll come back to you, Kyle.
[02:48:37.582 --> 02:48:39.783]  And let Luis finish up and hit one or two final articles.
[02:48:40.483 --> 02:48:41.484]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:41.684 --> 02:48:43.105]  Humanity's all in this together.
[02:48:45.876 --> 02:48:50.238]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.398 --> 02:48:54.840]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.980 --> 02:48:59.342]  There is a chance to use this disaster in a New World Order.
[02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:00.763]  A New World Order.
[02:49:02.544 --> 02:49:06.747]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.827 --> 02:49:13.771]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[02:51:46.501 --> 02:51:51.624]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.285 --> 02:51:54.627]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.647 --> 02:52:06.015]  About eight years ago, I saw a BBC News article that said, secretly in England, two years ago, human clones were created, but terminated before birth.
[02:52:06.675 --> 02:52:07.976]  Growing embryos.
[02:52:08.016 --> 02:52:13.040]  So yes, a long time ago, this scholar's talking about 20 years ago, I wasn't aware of that.
[02:52:14.717 --> 02:52:16.260]  This type of information was coming out.
[02:52:17.962 --> 02:52:19.745]  But go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Kyle.
[02:52:20.225 --> 02:52:21.027]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:52:21.868 --> 02:52:29.479]  Like I say, it was between 1980 and 1981, and the interviewer had been talking to the biological engineering spokesman.
[02:52:29.969 --> 02:52:36.872]  And their spokes gal, the interviewer, did a very good job getting the spokesman very excited about their successes they'd had in the lab.
[02:52:37.432 --> 02:52:45.816]  And she went on to describe, this was before they were doing recombinant DNA and such, they were just doing, combining sperm and egg with different animals.
[02:52:45.916 --> 02:52:50.558]  And she said, we were having some great success, and especially in several types of human
[02:52:51.278 --> 02:52:53.419]  And animal experimentation, she said.
[02:52:53.499 --> 02:52:55.140]  And the interviewer said, really, tell me about it.
[02:52:55.260 --> 02:53:03.643]  And the gal started telling me that they'd had successes in five different areas, some combining with human and chimpanzee.
[02:53:03.683 --> 02:53:06.764]  They had not had any luck with human and spider monkey.
[02:53:07.384 --> 02:53:13.327]  Oddly enough, she said, human and dog did not succeed, but human and jackal was remarkably successful.
[02:53:13.707 --> 02:53:16.008]  We had a viable embryo that looked like it was going to do well.
[02:53:16.348 --> 02:53:18.429]  But the most thing was that they were mostly successful.
[02:53:20.147 --> 02:53:23.430]  Excited about was they had a human and pig combination.
[02:53:23.871 --> 02:53:24.591]  Human and swine.
[02:53:24.911 --> 02:53:26.593]  And the gal went on and was getting very excited.
[02:53:26.633 --> 02:53:28.154]  Well, that's all admitted now.
[02:53:28.575 --> 02:53:30.356]  Oh, she said it went further than that.
[02:53:30.676 --> 02:53:34.500]  She went on and said, not only did we have a viable embryo, it went through to term.
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:36.902]  And it had the most amazing features, the hands.
[02:53:36.962 --> 02:53:40.185]  And it was just interesting to know how it was going, how it was growing.
[02:53:40.205 --> 02:53:42.406]  And it seemed to be quite intelligent.
[02:53:42.427 --> 02:53:45.129]  And it was learning to walk rapidly after only four months.
[02:53:45.169 --> 02:53:46.430]  And the interviewer said, whoa, wait.
[02:53:47.102 --> 02:53:50.786]  You had a pig human go to term and it was born?
[02:53:50.806 --> 02:53:54.229]  At that time, of course, the PR gal realized she'd been trapped.
[02:53:55.471 --> 02:53:59.475]  Well, that's like when I mentioned the New Jersey law, the guy had to admit it.
[02:53:59.515 --> 02:54:05.761]  Well, yes, you can bring it to term if it's for research, but you can't give it to the parents to take home.
[02:54:06.442 --> 02:54:08.424]  See, it's all semantical games.
[02:54:08.784 --> 02:54:10.166]  It's like years ago they were going to put up...
[02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:12.241]  Thousands of cameras.
[02:54:12.261 --> 02:54:19.865]  I said to the head of TxDOT Public Relations, John Hurt, I said, and it's on video, I said, Mr. Hurt, you're going to put up hundreds?
[02:54:19.885 --> 02:54:21.026]  He goes, no, thousands of cameras.
[02:54:21.366 --> 02:54:23.047]  And I go, and they're for law enforcement?
[02:54:23.067 --> 02:54:23.827]  He goes, no, no, no, no.
[02:54:24.188 --> 02:54:26.529]  And I said, ah, TxDOT's not law enforcement.
[02:54:26.549 --> 02:54:28.630]  Your sister agency will dual use it.
[02:54:28.650 --> 02:54:30.231]  He goes, you ought to be a lawyer, Alex.
[02:54:30.311 --> 02:54:30.952]  Absolutely.
[02:54:31.312 --> 02:54:32.132]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:54:32.412 --> 02:54:34.834]  So see, that's all how they play these semantical games.
[02:54:35.475 --> 02:54:41.238]  Kind of spooky to realize that even now, 20 years later, now they're saying, oh, we're just barely making inroads?
[02:54:41.859 --> 02:54:43.320]  When I saw it and heard from myself.
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:46.622]  Well, they're admitting in the news that they are making, they're doing it.
[02:54:46.662 --> 02:54:49.303]  I mean, but our guest was kind of soft-pedaling.
[02:54:49.483 --> 02:54:50.484]  Hey, good to hear from you, Kyle.
[02:54:51.685 --> 02:54:52.946]  Lewis in Kansas City.
[02:54:52.986 --> 02:54:53.926]  Lewis, go ahead, sir.
[02:54:54.406 --> 02:55:00.150]  No, it's Louise, and I just wanted to ask, did you see, by any chance, Nightline last night with Ted Koppel?
[02:55:00.911 --> 02:55:01.571]  No, I didn't see it.
[02:55:01.812 --> 02:55:03.413]  Okay, well, I didn't tape it.
[02:55:03.453 --> 02:55:06.535]  If somebody's listening and they want to give it to you, you might really be interested in it.
[02:55:06.835 --> 02:55:08.896]  He had a town hall meeting in St.
[02:55:08.916 --> 02:55:11.958]  John's Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., okay?
[02:55:12.498 --> 02:55:15.300]  And the topic of the show was Why Stay?
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:16.461]  It was about the war in Iraq.
[02:55:16.901 --> 02:55:26.448]  And at the very end of the show, he was really good because he had an audience of people, a broad range of all kinds of people, a list of people, people that had lost limbs from the war.
[02:55:26.468 --> 02:55:27.489]  So what was said at the end?
[02:55:27.649 --> 02:55:37.576]  Well, at the very end, somebody yelled out, because he was giving the closing comments, and somebody yelled out, what about Gulf War Syndrome and depleted uranium?
[02:55:37.616 --> 02:55:38.637]  And Ted Koppel said...
[02:55:39.019 --> 02:55:41.701]  I couldn't understand what was being said, and then the show ended.
[02:55:41.981 --> 02:55:46.824]  But all the stuff that was said, if somebody wants to give you a copy, I think you... And there's a guy that was on there.
[02:55:47.224 --> 02:55:52.988]  It's the man whose wife... She was leaked that she worked for the CIA.
[02:55:53.028 --> 02:55:53.308]  Yeah.
[02:55:53.589 --> 02:55:54.389]  He was very good.
[02:55:54.409 --> 02:55:55.650]  You ought to have that man as a guest.
[02:55:56.190 --> 02:55:56.651]  I hear you.
[02:55:56.671 --> 02:55:57.951]  Thank you for the call.
[02:55:57.991 --> 02:55:59.072]  You have a fabulous weekend.
[02:55:59.092 --> 02:56:01.173]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:56:01.193 --> 02:56:03.415]  And after that, I'll be on George Norrie this evening.
[02:56:04.093 --> 02:56:05.834]  And I'll see you back here on Monday.
[02:56:06.214 --> 02:56:13.376]  Thanks to all the affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, the folks running the show, my wife who's the producer, getting the guests, everybody.
[02:56:13.416 --> 02:56:14.876]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:56:14.976 --> 02:56:26.740]  If we can just inform the people about the sinister activities of the globalists, we can all stand together against corruption and evil instead of fighting with each other over what group we're with, then we can win.
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:27.580]  All right.
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:28.480]  God bless you all.
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:32.962]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are just two of the fine websites.
[02:56:33.042 --> 02:56:33.622]  Check them out!
