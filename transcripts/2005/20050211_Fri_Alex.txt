[00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:06.375]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:08.116]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:09.938]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:11.419]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.544]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:22.047]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.471]  It is Friday!
[00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:32.053]  Ladies and gentlemen, the 11th day of February 2005.
[00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:35.276]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:37.078]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.202]  Coming up in the next hour, Michael Markavage, he's the leader of the Christian group.
[00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.205]  Many of them facing 47 years in prison.
[00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:48.608]  The judge says the trial goes ahead to its fruition.
[00:00:50.635 --> 00:01:02.142]  And they have videotaped, the police have videotaped, they have videotaped of them in an outfest, simply praying on a street corner in an authorized protest zone, and for that they face 47 years in prison.
[00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:03.402]  You think we're joking?
[00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.523]  It's been in even the mainstream news.
[00:01:05.563 --> 00:01:07.885]  They say by praying it could have upset others.
[00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:09.986]  That could be terrorism.
[00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:12.928]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:15.409]  Larry Pratt's going to be joining us.
[00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.671]  We had Ron Paul's office on two days ago, and since then it's passed.
[00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:20.406]  We're good to go.
[00:01:49.699 --> 00:02:04.785]  The head of Gun Owners of America will be joining us to talk about the deception that's been foisted, again, against conservatives, telling us that, oh, it's to stop illegal aliens, this bill had nothing to do with it, but, again, that fooled the general public.
[00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:12.348]  So, that is coming up, as I said, in about 30 minutes from now, to be precise.
[00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:19.741]  Exactly 30 minutes and 50 seconds from now, we'll be joined by Larry Pratt.
[00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.143]  You do not want to miss that.
[00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:23.464]  Also, U.S.
[00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.107]  scientists say they are told to alter findings.
[00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:36.496]  More than 200 fish and wildlife researchers cite cases where conclusions were reversed to weaken protections and favor businesses, a survey finds.
[00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.737]  Well, yes, that's probably true.
[00:02:38.857 --> 00:03:00.168]  I can also remember hundreds of cases where you falsified evidence, where you released lynxes, or where you released wolves, or where you released mountain lions to then say, oh, there's an endangered species in the area, so we need to take people's property.
[00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:03.850]  So there's lots of fraud going on, and we'll be
[00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:15.119]  Covering that, and a story here out of the Associated Press, biometric devices can verify age, and they want to pass a federal law where you have to biometrically scan.
[00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:21.221]  Every time you get on the Internet, this will keep the children safe and, of course, track everything you're doing.
[00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:23.903]  But don't feel bad.
[00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:26.284]  You say you just won't get on the computer?
[00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:31.566]  Well, you'll be doing this to buy and sell as well, part of your new national ID card.
[00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:38.437]  And they're going to have an anti-terror test to follow winds and determine airborne paths in New York City.
[00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:46.887]  Of course, the government has killed people before in New York City with different biological tests they've done, but they say this test is going to be entirely safe.
[00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:48.189]  You can trust them.
[00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:49.811]  The government loves you.
[00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:53.039]  And the test probably isn't going to be dangerous because they're telling you about it.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.423]  The tests that are dangerous are the ones that tell you about 20 years after they do the little test.
[00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:10.529]  You can read these articles and a lot more at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:15.832]  But when we get back, House votes to make states verify license applicants.
[00:04:17.402 --> 00:04:17.822]  I.E.
[00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:19.884]  National ID Card.
[00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:21.165]  Another one here.
[00:04:21.205 --> 00:04:27.809]  Immigration bill sparks furor among some House Republicans, gun owners, and civil libertarians, quietly breaking ranks.
[00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.130]  Now, this is a liberal publication.
[00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:31.931]  Immigration bill?
[00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.973]  It's not an immigration bill.
[00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:35.434]  It's a national ID card.
[00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:38.075]  And here's Gun Owners of America's comment.
[00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:39.476]  National ID cards coming up.
[00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:43.639]  For a vote, threats to gun owners' privacy are a huge concern.
[00:04:45.163 --> 00:04:48.606]  I want to talk about this scumbag that police are searching for.
[00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:51.689]  Police search for mother of newborn tossed out of car.
[00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:54.471]  And a lot more after this quick break.
[00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.413]  You don't want to miss this transmission.
[00:04:56.853 --> 00:04:57.854]  Stay with us!
[00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.655]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.856 --> 00:05:10.282]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.422 --> 00:05:14.788]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:16.189]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.910]  Pan Amers.
[00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:22.192]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.252 --> 00:05:29.175]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.396]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:42.040]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.721]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then
[00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:47.663]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.183 --> 00:05:50.805]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:51.406]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:51.946]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:53.247]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.064 --> 00:06:01.665]  Hello, folks.
[00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:02.665]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:06.889]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:09.931]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:16.736]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:19.919]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.521]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:27.385]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:28.366]  We're good to go.
[00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:29.006]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:53.184]  803-4438.
[00:06:53.244 --> 00:06:54.584]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:58.886]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:08.330]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.972]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:20.215]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:26.719]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:28.100]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.382]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:32.443]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:33.564]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:33.864 --> 00:07:41.108]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.791]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:51.513]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:51.854]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:51.874 --> 00:07:54.995]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.476]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:58.116 --> 00:07:59.516]  Call today.
[00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:08.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.181]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:16.201]  Defending liberty.
[00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:17.802]  Resisting tyranny.
[00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:21.363]  Engaging in real talk radio.
[00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:25.744]  Real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:08:25.764 --> 00:08:28.265]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:33.566]  We don't look at issues via their labels, Republican or Democrat.
[00:08:33.606 --> 00:08:37.247]  We look at it versus freedom or tyranny.
[00:08:37.307 --> 00:08:39.308]  Does it give us more freedom or less freedom?
[00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:55.663]  And once you get past the rhetoric of the Republican and Democratic parties in this country, you find out they're all vacationing together, voting together, playing golf together, and laughing at us, the American people.
[00:08:56.704 --> 00:09:07.309]  Looting the economy, looting our pension funds, looting the Social Security fund, scamming us, dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:09:08.177 --> 00:09:20.525]  But so many people are caught up in what I call the bowl game or gladiatorial mindset of Ford versus Chevy, Coke versus Pepsi, Republican versus Democrat.
[00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:27.490]  When to use that analogy further, the same company, the same crime syndicate owns it all.
[00:09:28.491 --> 00:09:36.536]  It's a staged game, a staged boxing match with the winners predetermined, the losers predetermined.
[00:09:37.515 --> 00:09:40.777]  And once you realize that, I think you're going to get angry, folks.
[00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:44.120]  There's some confusion.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.524]  You know, people are emailing me going, Alex, you said a national ID card passed in December of 2004.
[00:09:49.984 --> 00:10:03.234]  And if you type in national ID card passed, you'll find the articles, AP, Reuters, Washington Post, USA Today, telling you that a national ID card did indeed pass in
[00:10:04.068 --> 00:10:10.672]  The Senate on December 16th, the House on December 7th of the last month of 2004.
[00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:20.937]  So why then are we seeing fresh headlines of National ID Card passes the House yesterday?
[00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:23.079]  Why are we seeing this?
[00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:25.560]  Well, because they're expanding it.
[00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:32.824]  You know, it's like we reported that Billy Bob built a house and finished it in December.
[00:10:33.684 --> 00:10:36.125]  And now he's added some more rooms onto it.
[00:10:36.165 --> 00:10:37.966]  That's basically what's happened.
[00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:50.673]  And then, so they've just expanded the National ID card for a Pan-American Union ID for DNA testing and databasing when you get a driver's license.
[00:10:51.214 --> 00:10:52.775]  Now, they're not going to implement this overnight.
[00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:54.015]  They're going to try to implement it.
[00:10:54.055 --> 00:10:54.816]  We've got to fight that.
[00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:56.717]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[00:10:57.477 --> 00:11:02.220]  It targets gun owners, abortion protesters, pro-lifers.
[00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:04.674]  It targets environmental activists.
[00:11:04.714 --> 00:11:05.594]  It targets everybody.
[00:11:06.035 --> 00:11:07.556]  And Ron Paul has spoken to this.
[00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:08.457]  Analyzed the bill.
[00:11:08.777 --> 00:11:10.239]  Larry Pratt has analyzed it.
[00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:16.765]  We have both of these great men's analysis up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:20.949]  And it has stuff even worse in it.
[00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:26.714]  If that's possible, the new beefed up expansion of the National ID Card.
[00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:31.016]  It has stuff even worse in it.
[00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:37.838]  It has a provision on the bill that says that the president is above the law and can circumvent any federal laws.
[00:11:37.938 --> 00:11:42.499]  And it mentions a fence to be built along the border over a few miles.
[00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:53.282]  But then when the lawyers, even in Republican congressmen and women's offices, looked at it, it clearly says nationwide and sets the precedent.
[00:11:54.395 --> 00:12:04.260]  And they did this sneakiness when they passed the first national ID card, which you knew as is driver's license standardization in December of last year.
[00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:11.344]  They said it's to stop illegal aliens because they know that's wildly popular and wildly constitutional.
[00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:18.648]  In major polls, 80 plus percent of Americans, including 60 plus percent of Hispanics, aren't against these wide open borders.
[00:12:18.688 --> 00:12:21.390]  We know it's killing our economy, killing our sovereignty.
[00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:29.489]  And the Democrats trying to make it a racial issue, the Republicans trying to make it a racial issue, and say, oh, you're just against Hispanics, that's failed.
[00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:34.450]  Miserably, the facts have come home to roost, and Hispanics aren't buying it.
[00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:40.171]  And so they know that it's the key issue with most Americans.
[00:12:41.572 --> 00:12:48.013]  And so every type of nightmare legislation they bring forward and then try to pass and pass has...
[00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:58.853]  platitudes and billboard-type propagandistic statements tagged onto it.
[00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:02.836]  But in truth, it does nothing to stop illegal immigration.
[00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:16.825]  In fact, the National ID Card legislation passed in December of last year actually gives a large portion of the amnesty legislation Bush has been trying to pass for four years, it actually puts a lot of that into law.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:26.265]  Telling the states and cities and banks and businesses, you will accept the consular matricula cards issued now by 40 plus countries.
[00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:29.968]  Again, I've been saying 30 countries for a long time, now it's over 40.
[00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:38.513]  That you will accept these, that basically are just a step up from stuff you get in a Cracker Jack box.
[00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:39.814]  Very easy to get.
[00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:42.583]  Very easy to falsify.
[00:13:42.904 --> 00:13:43.884]  But forget falsify.
[00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:53.412]  Anybody can wander in to the Polish or Mexican or Russian or Venezuelan or Nicaraguan or Chinese embassies and get one of these for a small fee.
[00:13:54.913 --> 00:13:58.676]  You can get multiple copies in any name you want and then go give them to other people.
[00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:02.870]  Well, they did that again in this piece of legislation.
[00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.152]  When the Republicans and the Democrats got caught...
[00:14:25.845 --> 00:14:37.714]  Passing the National ID card last December, they said, don't worry, once we found the subsections that actually made the borders wide open, don't worry, we're going to pick it up in the next session in 2005, and we'll fix it then.
[00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:42.617]  It's like they cut one of our legs off, and then we said, you cut our leg off.
[00:14:42.637 --> 00:14:46.440]  They said, don't worry, we'll fix it the next session, and they just hacked another leg off.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.081]  And said, see, we fixed it.
[00:14:49.142 --> 00:14:50.483]  As the country goes into shock.
[00:14:52.802 --> 00:15:06.429]  And most people don't read bills, they don't analyze legislation, they don't spend their lives doing this, so they just hear the neocons on talk radio and the CNNs and the Foxes of the world announcing, you know, the Democrats going, how dare you have this immigration bill?
[00:15:06.729 --> 00:15:09.731]  You know, they play the part of the good cop.
[00:15:10.331 --> 00:15:11.252]  How dare you do this?
[00:15:11.292 --> 00:15:18.135]  People think, oh my gosh, you know, you're trying to block the illegals, our precious illegals.
[00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:21.777]  And then the Republicans all run out and say, pass it, pass it, pass it!
[00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:29.651]  And it did indeed pass, and the only thing in there is that it mentions that there are illegal aliens in this country.
[00:15:29.671 --> 00:15:31.132]  It doesn't say anything about stopping them.
[00:15:31.153 --> 00:15:32.013]  No enforcement.
[00:15:33.034 --> 00:15:49.128]  The last bill said that they were going to hire 2,000 more Border Patrol in this Omnibus Intelligence Act, known as the 9-11 Bill, and then actually when it funded the 2,000 additional, the day after, Ridge said, we're not going to use that money for more Border Patrol.
[00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:49.649]  So...
[00:15:51.132 --> 00:15:51.953]  This is what they've done.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.120]  Pretty serious business.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.601]  And World Net Daily has written about this.
[00:16:18.661 --> 00:16:23.422]  Homeland Chief, to waive all laws, is the headline.
[00:16:26.323 --> 00:16:42.706]  And then they talk about a spokesman for Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican California, a supporter of the bill, whose district includes the border area, said he could not comment on the scope of the measure's language, but he emphasized the need to construct the barrier as soon as possible to shut down a potential entry point for terrorists.
[00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:49.014]  There is an urgent priority to finish the three-mile fence, said Joe Casper.
[00:16:49.474 --> 00:16:55.677]  For several years, we've been going back and forth from the California Coastal Commission to finish up this border fence with little success.
[00:16:56.217 --> 00:17:12.465]  But Jim Harper, a former Judiciary Committee staffer who now serves as Director of Information Policy Studies for the Libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, believes the way the bill is written does not limit the Secretary's powers to removing environmental impediments.
[00:17:13.692 --> 00:17:16.974]  Taking judicial review away is quite dramatic, he told Roll Net Daily.
[00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:23.718]  The Secretary, under a strict reading, could waive any law and conceivably detain people.
[00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:28.522]  Wiretap, the list would go on and on of the laws that could be waived.
[00:17:29.002 --> 00:17:37.027]  Harper said he objects to the bill being run through so quickly, which limits participation in the process to only the most aggressive players in Congress.
[00:17:37.647 --> 00:17:43.251]  It's really difficult to write legislation well, he said, which is the reason we have a slow, deliberative process today.
[00:17:43.982 --> 00:17:48.384]  Here we are, not having that process, and the result is shoddily written legislation.
[00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:49.464]  It's not shoddy.
[00:17:50.084 --> 00:17:50.864]  Very well written.
[00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:56.666]  Casper acknowledges the language is broad.
[00:17:57.027 --> 00:17:58.067]  Very broad.
[00:17:58.127 --> 00:18:09.351]  But one thing we need to remember is we are looking within the limits of the Secretary of Homeland Security what he deemed necessary to finish fences and roads and to, for the sake of national security, Casper said.
[00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.772]  And then we have the subsection posted.
[00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:17.336]  Then I have Ron Paul talking about it.
[00:18:17.437 --> 00:18:24.364]  I have Donors of America head Larry Pratt.
[00:18:24.644 --> 00:18:27.147]  I have liberal organizations talking about it.
[00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:28.568]  Here's the raw story.
[00:18:28.929 --> 00:18:34.515]  Immigration bill sparks furor among some House Republicans, gun owners, and civil libertarians.
[00:18:35.413 --> 00:18:39.056]  Well, Ron Paul's office didn't speak on the condition of anonymity two days ago.
[00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.878]  Several factors of the Republican Party...
[00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:05.552]  Are set up in arms over Republican-authorized H.R.
[00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:12.298]  418 or the REAL ID Act scheduled to go to the floor, now past the floor.
[00:19:12.358 --> 00:19:26.351]  The key players, according to aides, are Chris Smith, Ron Paul, Lincoln, Diaz, Bollert, Chairman Simpson-Brenner, and a very conservative Republican congressman with strong ties to Falwell and Dobson.
[00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:27.692]  That'd be Coon.
[00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:36.759]  Congressman Chris Smith, according to sources, is opposed to the Asylum Provision Act of 418, which could affect Christians persecuted, and it goes on and on.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.601]  Persecuting Christians?
[00:19:39.641 --> 00:19:40.882]  Man, that's what Bush is all about.
[00:19:43.263 --> 00:19:45.765]  All right, we'll come back and take a few calls.
[00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:52.790]  And we've got Larry Pratt of Governors of America coming on to analyze this with us and chronicle it.
[00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:57.047]  And we'll take more of your calls, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:57.267 --> 00:20:00.568]  Then we'll talk to Christians facing jail time for preaching.
[00:20:01.508 --> 00:20:08.450]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.771]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:21.513]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:20:22.415 --> 00:20:31.197]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[00:20:31.837 --> 00:20:36.918]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:05.630]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:11.453]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:11.933 --> 00:21:17.035]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:31.025]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:36.849]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:43.054]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:43.737]  1-800-686-2237
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:12.132]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:22:12.312 --> 00:22:19.920]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.304]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:23.444 --> 00:22:23.824]  We're good to go.
[00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:48.063]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:52.227]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:01.969 --> 00:23:08.253]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pets back in your step.
[00:23:08.474 --> 00:23:13.437]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[00:23:13.657 --> 00:23:26.926]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:30.409]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:33.030]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.051]  It's safe, non-evasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:40.332]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:44.054]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[00:23:44.334 --> 00:23:48.435]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition or just trying to beat the clock?
[00:23:48.715 --> 00:23:50.936]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[00:23:51.136 --> 00:23:54.497]  Go to www.LifeWavePromotions.com.
[00:23:54.758 --> 00:23:58.719]  Again, that's www.LifeWavePromotions.com.
[00:24:01.837 --> 00:24:12.183]  Alright, let's blitz through some of your calls, then we'll get to Larry Pratt.
[00:24:12.663 --> 00:24:15.745]  John in Las Vegas, Nevada, Sin City, welcome.
[00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:18.847]  Hey Alex, some encouraging news.
[00:24:18.947 --> 00:24:27.172]  One of the local talk stations here that does not screen their calls was discussing the 9-11 FAA stuff that recently came out.
[00:24:27.952 --> 00:24:29.433]  Ancient news that
[00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:37.389]  That they knew about plans of hijackers to get on board planes and fly them into buildings, and that Rice knew all about it.
[00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:45.253]  Absolutely, but what's really encouraging is a lot of people started calling in, and I've been calling into that show every time I drive to work.
[00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:54.777]  I call in and constantly harp on the issue, and one of the talk show hosts on it is a total lib, and he's all of a sudden starting to get the idea.
[00:24:55.714 --> 00:25:02.779]  Today, no less than 20 or 30 people were finally saying the things that I've been saying for a long time.
[00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:11.424]  I got in and I obviously mentioned 9-11 Road to Tyranny, the Masters of Terror, Operation Northwoods, 9-11 in plain sight.
[00:25:13.326 --> 00:25:17.308]  The frustration that I've been having is finally being lifted because people are waking up.
[00:25:17.348 --> 00:25:18.449]  They're waking up very quickly.
[00:25:19.057 --> 00:25:20.058]  I think we're good to go.
[00:25:39.828 --> 00:25:43.930]  I'm telling you, the frustration is lifted, and I see a huge awakening.
[00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.131]  With at least 20 people saying that, there's no doubt the word is getting out.
[00:25:48.531 --> 00:26:00.736]  Well, look, I've got to tell you, I've done probably 2,000 interviews now in the last three and a half years since 9-11, and maybe one caller out of 30 calls in and disagrees with me on shows where the host is attacking me.
[00:26:00.756 --> 00:26:04.037]  I mean, look, they're losing control, okay?
[00:26:04.077 --> 00:26:05.238]  The facts are coming out.
[00:26:05.558 --> 00:26:06.318]  They're panicking.
[00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:08.819]  I mean, this Popular Mechanics article that we now have posted
[00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:12.641]  At InfoWars.com, they go, growing armies of them.
[00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:13.721]  They're taking over.
[00:26:13.861 --> 00:26:15.562]  Their lies are taking over.
[00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:18.803]  No, the truth is taking over, and you're going to lose.
[00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:22.825]  Well, thank God that you're out there, Alex, because you woke me up to it.
[00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:26.547]  I knew about the New World Order, but I didn't know there was a Hegelian dialectic.
[00:26:26.947 --> 00:26:32.129]  I thought it was a left-wing thing, and I am totally awake to it, and I'm just glad that I...
[00:26:32.774 --> 00:26:33.275]  All right.
[00:26:33.295 --> 00:26:37.158]  Exciting testimony.
[00:26:37.238 --> 00:26:39.580]  Good to hear from you, John.
[00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:42.002]  Marty in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:26:42.043 --> 00:26:42.423]  Welcome.
[00:26:43.424 --> 00:26:47.668]  Yeah, I was wondering, I was listening to kind of Howard Stern this morning.
[00:26:47.688 --> 00:26:48.428]  He was mentioning the...
[00:26:50.224 --> 00:26:57.970]  Michael Powell and those guys want to make it to where, you know, the public meetings that they hold for FCC, for regulations and things, they want to now make them private.
[00:26:58.371 --> 00:27:00.152]  Well, yeah, everything's private.
[00:27:00.232 --> 00:27:03.055]  We can't have the slaves seeing what we're doing.
[00:27:03.095 --> 00:27:04.055]  It has to be secret.
[00:27:04.075 --> 00:27:11.701]  So do you think this is just another tactic for them to take over the airwaves and not let you know what is indecent, what is not?
[00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:12.942]  I mean, you see what I'm saying?
[00:27:12.982 --> 00:27:13.543]  It's just like...
[00:27:14.203 --> 00:27:17.686]  Another small step towards the control over mass media.
[00:27:17.706 --> 00:27:19.888]  Yeah, all that indecency stuff's a red herring.
[00:27:20.168 --> 00:27:21.669]  You notice they selectively enforce it.
[00:27:21.689 --> 00:27:28.714]  You'll have the most vile stuff you can imagine on Fox, but then somebody says something vile on radio and they put them in the clink.
[00:27:29.275 --> 00:27:29.555]  Exactly.
[00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:31.496]  So this is how it all works.
[00:27:31.837 --> 00:27:37.701]  Right, and I know he's a big First Amendment supporter, Howard Stern, so I heard that this morning and I was like, wow.
[00:27:37.721 --> 00:27:38.762]  Yeah.
[00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:42.888]  I just want to know if you... I didn't hear it from him, but I already knew about it.
[00:27:42.928 --> 00:27:43.468]  Right, right, right.
[00:27:43.968 --> 00:27:44.949]  I appreciate the call, Marty.
[00:27:44.989 --> 00:27:46.309]  Let me just add something about 9-11.
[00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:52.472]  For six months after 9-11, they said that all of the firefighter and police tapes had malfunctioned.
[00:27:52.892 --> 00:27:53.693]  There were no tapes.
[00:27:54.353 --> 00:27:56.854]  Well, firefighters and police got mad and leaked the tapes.
[00:27:57.575 --> 00:28:00.616]  Firefighters go in, the fires are almost out, bombs are going off.
[00:28:01.488 --> 00:28:03.249]  And those tapes, a lot of them are public.
[00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:04.110]  We have them on the website.
[00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:09.433]  Well, now there's a New York Times article today and a few others about the lawsuits to release all those tapes.
[00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:15.257]  So here's the government first saying they didn't exist, and now here's the lawsuits where they admit they exist, but they don't want to release them.
[00:28:16.037 --> 00:28:18.619]  Well, already the firefighters had some of those tapes and did release them.
[00:28:18.819 --> 00:28:20.120]  They're very angry about this.
[00:28:21.981 --> 00:28:28.825]  But on top of it, then we have firefighters finding three of the black boxes, which are actually orange boxes with big black stripes on them.
[00:28:28.845 --> 00:28:29.766]  They look like a bumblebee.
[00:28:30.744 --> 00:28:31.405]  Or a hornet.
[00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:36.227]  And the FBI grabbed them and said, shut your mouth about these boxes and snuck off with them.
[00:28:36.508 --> 00:28:37.128]  Why is that?
[00:28:37.168 --> 00:28:38.569]  Why don't they want us to hear the boxes?
[00:28:39.089 --> 00:28:41.230]  Why did they order the FAA to shred the tapes?
[00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:42.091]  Which is illegal.
[00:28:42.491 --> 00:28:43.572]  That's Associated Press.
[00:28:44.172 --> 00:28:45.393]  The FAA tapes themselves.
[00:28:45.673 --> 00:28:45.973]  Why?
[00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.255]  Because it was an inside job, boys and girls.
[00:28:48.675 --> 00:28:50.556]  Robert in Denver, you're on the air, sir.
[00:28:51.314 --> 00:28:52.234]  Good morning, Alexander.
[00:28:52.254 --> 00:28:53.335]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:54.015]  How you doing?
[00:28:54.355 --> 00:28:54.916]  Good, good.
[00:28:55.836 --> 00:28:56.816]  Great show yesterday.
[00:28:56.896 --> 00:28:59.778]  Really enjoyed Mr. Huffman the last hour.
[00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:05.260]  And you guys got into something that really piqued my interest, but you weren't able to talk about it much because of the lack of time.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:13.484]  Speak to the strategic reasons about the World Trade Center as opposed to 30 Rock or Empire State Building.
[00:29:13.524 --> 00:29:15.825]  How did they decide on that complex?
[00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:19.446]  Because you didn't have a whole giant area owned by one person, and...
[00:29:21.787 --> 00:29:28.150]  That's the main reason, and because the Rockefeller family, who the Port Authority had owned it, and it just sold it to Silverstein.
[00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:36.874]  And so it was a huge area that they controlled, so they could really have a lot of damage and play it out kind of like a movie script throughout an eight-hour period.
[00:29:37.614 --> 00:29:37.954]  I see.
[00:29:38.615 --> 00:29:39.395]  One other quick thing.
[00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:47.259]  As you know, I think it was October last year, the federal judge in the East Coast said that the military couldn't inoculate any more soldiers.
[00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:48.179]  But they're still doing it.
[00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:49.100]  Stay there.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.820]  We'll get back to you later.
[00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.771]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.852]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.892 --> 00:29:58.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.495 --> 00:30:05.717]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:30:06.458 --> 00:30:14.722]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:17.043]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[00:30:17.764 --> 00:30:18.384]  While you listen,
[00:30:19.019 --> 00:30:23.721]  Verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:30:24.342 --> 00:30:25.923]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:30:26.463 --> 00:30:28.604]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:30:29.204 --> 00:30:31.225]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:30:31.806 --> 00:30:32.886]  And it's so easy.
[00:30:33.607 --> 00:30:35.608]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:30:36.448 --> 00:30:37.068]  When you want.
[00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:38.249]  Where you want.
[00:30:39.069 --> 00:30:44.032]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[00:30:44.904 --> 00:30:47.447]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[00:30:47.467 --> 00:30:47.607]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:30:47.627 --> 00:30:48.127]  That's 419-W-O-R-D.
[00:30:48.147 --> 00:30:48.448]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:09.584]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.844 --> 00:31:14.206]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:23.410]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:27.252]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.532 --> 00:31:32.575]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.855 --> 00:31:39.599]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:40.719]  What about you?
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.522]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:46.423]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:54.087 --> 00:31:54.147]  1-888-803-4438
[00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:04.451]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[00:32:04.771 --> 00:32:07.053]  Not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:14.398]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:32:14.598 --> 00:32:19.981]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:27.666]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:32:27.866 --> 00:32:28.987]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:30.087]  We're good to go.
[00:32:30.127 --> 00:32:30.668]  We're good to go.
[00:33:38.435 --> 00:33:46.439]  All right, folks, welcome back.
[00:33:46.499 --> 00:33:51.102]  It is Friday, 33 minutes and 50 seconds into this first hour.
[00:33:52.099 --> 00:34:04.362]  We're about to go to Larry Pratt, the executive director and the head honcho at a wonderful organization, one of the true only gun organizations out there that isn't a Trojan horse, Gun Owners of America.
[00:34:04.402 --> 00:34:06.423]  Check them out at gunowners.org.
[00:34:06.443 --> 00:34:11.024]  We'll be going to Larry here in just a few minutes to talk about the mass deception going on.
[00:34:11.064 --> 00:34:17.686]  We had Ron Paul's office on two days ago as the bill was being hotly debated, an expansion of the national ID card.
[00:34:18.106 --> 00:34:19.106]  They've passed both.
[00:34:20.227 --> 00:34:29.772]  Versions of this, the one they passed in December and the beefing up that just passed the House, now going to the Senate, by lying to the people saying it has to do with illegal immigration.
[00:34:30.252 --> 00:34:34.374]  A total fraud actually makes it easier for the illegal aliens to operate.
[00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:39.005]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes with Larry Pratt and how it affects gun owners.
[00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:40.987]  There's DNA databases in it.
[00:34:41.647 --> 00:34:47.613]  I mean, just one of these provisions would be a tin alarm fire, you know, screaming on the air for three hours.
[00:34:48.574 --> 00:34:52.098]  But there's just so much evil hitting us, it's making my head spin.
[00:34:52.598 --> 00:34:53.899]  They're dismantling this country.
[00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.601]  So Larry Pratt's coming up here in about 100 seconds.
[00:34:58.126 --> 00:35:00.228]  First off, folks, I've made 11 films.
[00:35:00.268 --> 00:35:03.330]  They're all available through Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.413]  You can order them via the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:14.339]  You can go to the website, read about the films, look at all the different specials, the books, the pro-gun t-shirts, the bumper stickers.
[00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:21.845]  And it also supports this broadcast, but number one, it's some of the best info and materials and best produced information out there, bar none.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:32.603]  You need to go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and peruse the safe, secure online shopping carts and look at the different specials and watch the clips and then order some of the videos.
[00:35:32.623 --> 00:35:33.963]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:35:34.003 --> 00:35:47.128]  We carry a great film, Innocence Betrayed, the most professional Second Amendment documentary I've ever seen about the mass murder of populations worldwide after they have their guns taken or after gun registration.
[00:35:48.008 --> 00:35:51.509]  And Jews, the Preservation of Firearms Ownerships made the film
[00:35:52.433 --> 00:35:58.218]  And it comes with three color booklets when you order the video on VHS or DVD.
[00:35:58.779 --> 00:36:03.402]  We have that video available via InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:03.422 --> 00:36:03.462]  888-253-3139.
[00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:16.700]  Get my 9-11 films.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.801]  Get any of the other great videos I carry.
[00:36:19.222 --> 00:36:25.025]  A bunch of other different researchers and authors' films.
[00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:26.246]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:27.027 --> 00:36:31.850]  You can call and ask about the different titles and information and order via the phone there as well.
[00:36:33.047 --> 00:36:34.929]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv.
[00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:42.795]  You can watch all the films I've made, dozens of other films, my weekly TV intelligence reports, all the best audio interviews I do.
[00:36:42.815 --> 00:36:44.797]  It's just a ridiculous deal.
[00:36:44.857 --> 00:36:48.180]  Fifteen cents a day, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.303]  Now going to Larry Pratt, Executive Director of Gun Owners of America.
[00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:57.027]  Larry, I mean, we're more busy now than we were under Bill Clinton, my friend.
[00:36:58.058 --> 00:37:00.359]  Well, I haven't noticed it getting any easier.
[00:37:00.379 --> 00:37:00.459]  Yeah.
[00:37:01.499 --> 00:37:04.660]  And they're getting what they want under Lord Bush.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:16.562]  The measure that was passed for the so-called standardized driver's license is truly the platform for a national ID card.
[00:37:17.303 --> 00:37:26.885]  And I just don't know what it's going to take to try to get through to folks that if Ted Kennedy has trouble getting on an airplane...
[00:37:28.364 --> 00:37:35.548]  Two or three times before he finally is able to clear the matter up, something you or I would never be able to do.
[00:37:35.568 --> 00:37:38.911]  It's now seven different members of Congress that can't fly.
[00:37:39.251 --> 00:37:39.971]  Yes, right.
[00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:47.570]  At least Kennedy had the chutzpah to call the head of Homeland Security and get it straightened out.
[00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.372]  But most of us don't have that type of pull.
[00:37:50.812 --> 00:37:51.873]  Ain't going to happen.
[00:37:52.113 --> 00:37:56.876]  And so every time normal people go to fly, same thing.
[00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:58.998]  Sorry you missed your flight.
[00:37:59.078 --> 00:38:00.519]  Maybe we can get you on the next one.
[00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:02.781]  Looks like you might be okay.
[00:38:03.321 --> 00:38:10.006]  Well, the same thing happens a lot to gun buyers, and there's no reason why that couldn't get a whole lot worse than
[00:38:10.764 --> 00:38:17.607]  Either because the information gets worse or because whoever's in charge of the information decides to make it worse.
[00:38:18.147 --> 00:38:25.851]  You know, what happens if we get a President Hillary Clinton or somebody else that really has it in for gun owners?
[00:38:27.351 --> 00:38:39.757]  We can watch ourselves get put on all kinds of watch lists and, frankly, the time could come when you might have trouble getting your driver's license, your national ID card,
[00:38:40.382 --> 00:38:44.603]  Because you've got some problem in there that some bureaucrat really doesn't like about you.
[00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:58.186]  Now, they admit this national system to have jobs, to travel, to own a car, all of this is going to run according to the same system as the TSA under Infrastructure Protection Act and the new Maritime Administration.
[00:38:58.527 --> 00:39:04.268]  These hundreds of private databases full of errors being indexed and being checked
[00:39:04.958 --> 00:39:08.120]  And we're talking about just a nightmare system.
[00:39:08.181 --> 00:39:22.531]  But look, Ron Paul's analysis of the bill that passed the House yesterday, now going to the Senate, he talks about DNA databases to get a driver's license, a Pan American Union ID card, it going after gun owners and pro-lifers.
[00:39:22.551 --> 00:39:24.032]  This is Ron Paul's analysis.
[00:39:25.053 --> 00:39:29.456]  Well, the bill does provide, clearly, we're not having to impute to
[00:39:30.351 --> 00:39:38.956]  Some day when they might have a Pan-American card, but it talks right there in the bill about sharing the data with the Canadians and the Mexicans.
[00:39:39.036 --> 00:39:41.077]  Standardizing it.
[00:39:41.117 --> 00:39:51.723]  The Canadians are not exactly our political allies, and the Mexicans operate somewhere between hostile and just downright corrupt.
[00:39:52.543 --> 00:39:56.185]  And by the way, every time they accuse us of being racist and want to
[00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:04.072]  Anybody in the United States that wants to effectively close our borders to illegal immigration... They're southern borders like North Korea's border.
[00:40:04.273 --> 00:40:05.553]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:06.013 --> 00:40:12.435]  You can get across that southern border, but you may die trying because they're serious about controlling that border.
[00:40:12.455 --> 00:40:14.876]  Yeah, they shoot people, they put them in these open-air camps.
[00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.377]  I mean, it is serious business.
[00:40:17.497 --> 00:40:23.239]  So, those folks are not only hypocrites, but they are, of course, quite corrupt, and...
[00:40:24.253 --> 00:40:29.744]  That just boggles the mind that we would want to share sensitive data about Americans.
[00:40:30.367 --> 00:40:34.048]  Let alone with American bureaucrats, but then to give it to Mexican bureaucrats?
[00:40:34.068 --> 00:40:37.649]  Well, they're already merging our Social Security with 30-plus countries.
[00:40:38.409 --> 00:40:43.590]  In the last Homeland Security platform for the National ID card, now they're beefing it up.
[00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.151]  They passed it that we're going to accept their consular matricula cards and give them driver's licenses.
[00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:51.092]  I mean, it's the exact opposite.
[00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:54.433]  I had Jeff Dice from Ron Paul's office as his spokesman on.
[00:40:55.573 --> 00:40:58.895]  His media office had on, and he said it's the opposite.
[00:40:58.915 --> 00:41:00.136]  It's totally deceptive.
[00:41:01.296 --> 00:41:07.720]  It does nothing to control the borders, but they're selling it as that, and the lying neocons are on the radio, Larry, lying about it.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:14.684]  A bill to control the borders would put up a fence, such as seems to have worked very well in Israel.
[00:41:15.104 --> 00:41:18.266]  You'd have a beefed-up border patrol.
[00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.887]  You wouldn't be telling the people that live there that
[00:41:21.307 --> 00:41:29.352]  They better not break the law if they try to stop somebody from violating their property and crossing the border across their property.
[00:41:30.033 --> 00:41:36.177]  Just because people are getting mugged and raped as the illegals stream across, that's no reason to get all upset.
[00:41:36.237 --> 00:41:37.818]  Yeah, trespassing is a big deal.
[00:41:37.898 --> 00:41:43.982]  They come out and arrest families and threaten them and say, I don't care if they've robbed your garage 55 times.
[00:41:44.322 --> 00:41:44.542]  No.
[00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:46.063]  No problem.
[00:41:46.444 --> 00:41:49.666]  So we're absolutely turning away from that.
[00:41:50.166 --> 00:41:59.788]  I'm not convinced that the FBI would be able to deal any more effectively with the information that it had about September 11 now than it would have then.
[00:42:00.428 --> 00:42:02.548]  Why don't we make sure that's been done?
[00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:09.030]  Why don't we get the immigration service to actually turn people away with bad visas?
[00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.110]  Well, there you go again.
[00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:15.471]  Two months ago when they passed this national ID card, not to be confused, they're now expanding it, folks.
[00:42:16.432 --> 00:42:21.754]  They said, oh, and it's got 2,000 more Border Patrol, but the day after Ridge said, we're not going to let you fund that.
[00:42:21.794 --> 00:42:22.694]  We're taking that money.
[00:42:24.755 --> 00:42:38.360]  Well, Ridge is used to telling us what to do because twice legislation has been passed saying arm the pilots, and they are so hostile to arm pilots that I just saw this latest outrage.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.501]  It just boggles the mind.
[00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:42.762]  Even Barbara Boxer is for arming all the pilots, but not Bush.
[00:42:43.202 --> 00:42:43.782]  Not Bush.
[00:42:44.122 --> 00:42:45.383]  It really boggles the mind.
[00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:53.098]  A pilot who was qualified to carry a gun, he was one of the few that had managed to crawl over the bureaucratic glass.
[00:42:53.538 --> 00:42:54.799]  Fourteen flaming hoops.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.221]  Had everything in place.
[00:42:57.782 --> 00:43:12.275]  Well, he was pulled aside and he's been put on a watch list because he was carrying, since he was off duty, they thought it was horrendous that he was carrying some ammo in his pocket that he would use
[00:43:12.836 --> 00:43:17.681]  Were he on duty for the authorized firearm that he would be carrying?
[00:43:17.842 --> 00:43:18.442]  Were he on duty?
[00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:22.066]  Yeah, he's going into the airport off duty, about to clock in and be on duty.
[00:43:22.246 --> 00:43:23.768]  He has to bring his bullets in with him.
[00:43:23.988 --> 00:43:24.789]  Oh, how dare you?
[00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:34.780]  So, this is a guy that was given a letter of censure before being allowed to return to work.
[00:43:35.522 --> 00:43:39.064]  Are you some kind of liberal, Larry, for being for arming the pilots?
[00:43:39.124 --> 00:43:41.646]  It's conservative to be against guns.
[00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:46.649]  Well, I'm not sure what these words mean anymore in our present context.
[00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:56.415]  I used to think it was a conservative position, conserving the freedom protected by the Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, but maybe you're right.
[00:43:56.455 --> 00:43:56.835]  I don't know.
[00:43:56.915 --> 00:44:03.219]  Our allies on this have ranged from the American Conservative Union to the American Civil Liberties Union, and
[00:44:03.777 --> 00:44:05.978]  I must admit, that makes me a little bit nervous.
[00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:12.763]  But what about when Boxer came out a year and a half ago on this arming the pilots thing, really heated up, and Bush said, we're not arming any of them.
[00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:14.604]  And she said, let's arm all of them.
[00:44:15.004 --> 00:44:19.267]  We trust them with the plane, you know, with hundreds of switches and all this.
[00:44:19.327 --> 00:44:23.650]  Why not trust them with a gun and a little armored safe they can get to inside the cockpit?
[00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.632]  And Bush said, okay, we'll arm 2% if they can jump through all these hoops.
[00:44:27.892 --> 00:44:31.735]  And the one guy that jumps through all the hoops tries to bring his bullets into the airport to
[00:44:32.535 --> 00:44:33.375]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:44:33.635 --> 00:44:37.756]  That's how we're going to deal with the security problems from September 11.
[00:44:38.816 --> 00:44:44.438]  We're going to have the American people treated like a herd of cattle, given their ID number.
[00:44:45.918 --> 00:44:58.441]  There's a lot of talk now that this thing will end up, including thanks to the ability of the Homeland Security Administration to write the regs, it'll end up with one of these radio frequency ID chips.
[00:44:59.211 --> 00:45:12.584]  And the technology of those so far that they're talking about using through the State Department is so bad that probably my 13-year-old grandson could hack it and get all the information of everybody passing by within 30 feet.
[00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:16.488]  Well, that's the point of all of this, is it's about a cashless grid.
[00:45:16.528 --> 00:45:17.829]  We have their own internal documents.
[00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.631]  Every product's going to have this.
[00:45:19.671 --> 00:45:22.394]  This will all be read by the garbage truck.
[00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.091]  This is mainstream, folks.
[00:45:24.131 --> 00:45:31.154]  When it comes to your house, it's about tracking our consumption and catching us if we don't pay the national sales tax once that all starts.
[00:45:31.194 --> 00:45:34.155]  It has nothing to do with terrorism, folks.
[00:45:34.195 --> 00:45:45.361]  It's about matching the chip in your driver's license or your ID card when you're at the cash register and then matching that with the stuff that goes to the landfill to find out if you're cheating on the national sales tax.
[00:45:45.581 --> 00:45:47.422]  And again, that's their own internal documents, Larry.
[00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:52.946]  You know, wouldn't it be neat if before they impose this on us, they set the same standard for themselves?
[00:45:53.347 --> 00:46:01.573]  For example, how about if we had the same level of transparency for Kofi Annan and company during the oil for food scandal?
[00:46:01.733 --> 00:46:03.335]  Well, they get diplomatic immunity.
[00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:05.176]  Now, they're above the law just like the illegal aliens.
[00:46:06.957 --> 00:46:11.421]  The problem is we're not UN bureaucrats, and we're not illegal aliens from Russia or Mexico.
[00:46:11.801 --> 00:46:16.285]  Therefore, we're going to have it stuck to us, and that seems to be the...
[00:46:17.189 --> 00:46:23.355]  The way that these folks are operating... Larry, this is an encyclopedic or voluminous piece of legislation.
[00:46:23.395 --> 00:46:27.719]  I mean, Ron Paul is talking about DNA sampling to get driver's license.
[00:46:28.259 --> 00:46:29.520]  I mean, where is this going to end?
[00:46:29.561 --> 00:46:30.601]  This passed the House.
[00:46:30.902 --> 00:46:32.183]  How do we defeat this in the Senate?
[00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:43.233]  Well, we can hope that the Senate, which has always been a little bit more cranky and does have rules that make it easier to stop things, let's hope that we can find...
[00:46:43.823 --> 00:46:44.063]  I think so.
[00:47:06.283 --> 00:47:09.505]  Why are the big national talk show hosts being so deceptive?
[00:47:09.525 --> 00:47:10.345]  They're not stupid.
[00:47:10.365 --> 00:47:13.267]  They know that this actually makes it easier for illegals.
[00:47:13.327 --> 00:47:15.688]  They know that it sets up a nightmare system.
[00:47:16.108 --> 00:47:20.410]  Why are these big national talk show hosts being deceptive in your opinion, Larry?
[00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:27.894]  Well, they're either deceptive or they're awful lazy because the information is certainly out there for anybody who wants to
[00:47:28.604 --> 00:47:29.364]  Look into it.
[00:47:30.825 --> 00:47:39.128]  I just can't imagine that the bugaboo of the illegal alien has driven us to giving away our basic freedoms.
[00:47:39.689 --> 00:47:40.409]  But here we are.
[00:47:41.452 --> 00:48:01.254]  On the verge of this national ID card legislation becoming law, forgetting what the founders, I believe it was Ben Franklin who was probably most famous for having said it, that if we think we're going to increase the amount of security we have by trading off some of our freedom, we're going to end up with neither one.
[00:48:02.216 --> 00:48:03.956]  And that's exactly where we are right now.
[00:48:04.157 --> 00:48:05.517]  So we contact the Senate.
[00:48:05.597 --> 00:48:08.418]  Can't one senator block this legislation if they want to?
[00:48:08.618 --> 00:48:16.940]  They could for a while, and if they start putting pressure on them, we're going to need a few of them to be willing to mount a filibuster.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.761]  That's certainly doable.
[00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:30.864]  The rules over there do make it a lot easier, and if folks want to go to gunowners.org, right now the only thing we have up deals with the House, but we're going to be
[00:48:31.845 --> 00:48:39.406]  Updating it for the Senate and making it easy for people to contact the Senate as well, right from our website with an email that we'll have written.
[00:48:39.827 --> 00:48:42.607]  Larry, I want to spend a few minutes with you on some other subjects.
[00:48:42.647 --> 00:48:54.469]  I mean, we can't, in two hours, we couldn't do justice to the bill that just passed the House for the expansion of the National ID Card into the most draconian applications of the National ID Card, folks.
[00:48:54.769 --> 00:48:55.890]  Out of the gates, they're doing this.
[00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.230]  I want to talk about the State of the Second Amendment right now.
[00:48:59.082 --> 00:49:06.187]  We've got Arnold banning 50 cals, cities banning ammo, we've got New York opening the door to sue gun manufacturers.
[00:49:06.647 --> 00:49:14.833]  I mean, we've got some serious problems, and the average gun owner I talk to is sucking their thumb thinking the second coming has happened and that Lord Bush is going to keep them safe.
[00:49:15.834 --> 00:49:25.821]  That is a matter that concerns us a great deal, that people look at the situation, well, the Republicans have the House, the Senate, the presidency, what could go wrong?
[00:49:26.474 --> 00:49:54.507]  Well, even if no other bad legislation were to pass, and we're talking about major bad legislation right now, which could turn into a national gun registry very, very easily, we're still talking about the very likely possibility, politics don't stay the same, that there'll be a very aggressive anti-gunner in charge someday in the future here in Washington.
[00:49:55.131 --> 00:50:03.254]  And if we leave them the level of gun laws, gun control laws that are on the books right now, they're just going to start from there and move on.
[00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:12.377]  But, I mean, already at the states, from a lot of so-called Republican quarters, Attacky, Swartzy, and others, I mean, they're having a heyday butchering it at the state level.
[00:50:13.138 --> 00:50:16.699]  We've not had the best of times.
[00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:22.041]  For example, in Virginia, we had been pushing a bill to...
[00:50:22.808 --> 00:50:35.470]  Convert the concealed carry law in Virginia to that of almost identical to the state of Alaska, where essentially you're free to carry a firearm without any permit or license whatsoever.
[00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:39.571]  A Republican committee chose not to act on it.
[00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.571]  We'll be back with Larry Pratt.
[00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:47.692]  I want to talk about Alberto Above the Law Gonzalez, who says he wants our guns.
[00:50:47.752 --> 00:50:50.733]  I mean, he says he doesn't just like gun control.
[00:50:50.793 --> 00:50:51.473]  It's in his heart.
[00:50:52.455 --> 00:50:56.696]  And he wants your guns, and we'll talk about him when we get back.
[00:50:56.896 --> 00:50:57.716]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:51:02.397 --> 00:51:09.799]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:14.801]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.001 --> 00:51:20.662]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.902 --> 00:51:21.663]  The Alex Jones Show!
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.420]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.903 --> 00:52:04.907]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:14.078]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.398 --> 00:52:19.084]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.524 --> 00:52:26.249]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.649 --> 00:52:38.458]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.918 --> 00:52:43.382]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:45.984]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:46.024 --> 00:52:47.686]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.746 --> 00:52:49.127]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:49.147 --> 00:52:50.608]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.628 --> 00:52:51.689]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.406 --> 00:53:08.348]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.568 --> 00:53:10.829]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.009 --> 00:53:17.371]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.711 --> 00:53:18.372]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.325 --> 00:53:41.145]  We're good to go.
[00:53:41.165 --> 00:53:42.265]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.366 --> 00:54:13.148]  Gunowners.org.
[00:54:13.228 --> 00:54:16.171]  Larry Pratt, give them the phone number to give you guys a call.
[00:54:17.152 --> 00:54:21.576]  That can be done by calling toll-free at 888-886-GUNS.
[00:54:21.996 --> 00:54:22.457]  It's 888-886-GUNS.
[00:54:25.965 --> 00:54:26.245]  Done.
[00:54:27.006 --> 00:54:33.370]  And the fight for the Second Amendment is raging right now, and again, folks, you need to wake up that that war is happening.
[00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:37.333]  You know, the enemy told you, go to sleep, you won, go home, and it's actually worse than ever.
[00:54:37.893 --> 00:54:43.737]  Larry Alberto, I love torture, I'm above the law, Bush is above the law, Gonzalez is our new Attorney General.
[00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:45.232]  As you know well.
[00:54:45.272 --> 00:54:46.833]  You put out alerts on this subject.
[00:54:46.893 --> 00:54:48.074]  He is an anti-gunner.
[00:54:48.654 --> 00:54:50.155]  He's a pro-abortion promoter.
[00:54:50.215 --> 00:54:52.236]  I mean, he's as liberal as Bill Clinton or worse.
[00:54:52.977 --> 00:54:57.980]  And at least Ashcroft said, oh, I believe in the Second Amendment, it prescribed by law, which was lawyer talk.
[00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.502]  We can butcher it if we want to.
[00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:01.484]  But it puts some people to sleep.
[00:55:01.524 --> 00:55:07.314]  Now Bush, with his political capital, has put an anti-gunner in, and now they've got their new BATF offices in D.C.
[00:55:07.334 --> 00:55:10.639]  They can move into more BATF people.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.786]  What do you see happening with Alberto, I want your guns, Gonzalez?
[00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:24.121]  Well, certainly any lawsuit that's going toward the Supreme Court is not going to have Second Amendment support from the Attorney General's office.
[00:55:24.681 --> 00:55:26.822]  Frankly, we didn't have it under Ashcroft.
[00:55:27.222 --> 00:55:33.324]  As you point out, he may have said he thought that the Second Amendment protected that individual right.
[00:55:34.255 --> 00:55:35.256]  But then he said, but.
[00:55:35.736 --> 00:55:42.181]  And after the but came the taking away of everything that he had conceded before the but.
[00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:46.845]  And that's like a group of enemy soldiers coming to your gates and waving the white flag and saying, let us in.
[00:55:46.925 --> 00:55:49.587]  And once they get in, boy, you're in trouble.
[00:55:49.727 --> 00:55:51.408]  He used to be called the Trojan Horse.
[00:55:52.289 --> 00:55:55.391]  And we've been dealing with that Trojan Horse.
[00:55:56.712 --> 00:56:00.555]  Perhaps we've been done a favor by Gonzales because he didn't mince any words.
[00:56:00.895 --> 00:56:01.876]  He didn't have any of this
[00:56:02.486 --> 00:56:04.887]  I'm in favor of the Second Amendment butt talk.
[00:56:04.927 --> 00:56:10.770]  He just said, I really believe in my heart, like you were saying, that gun control is needed.
[00:56:11.891 --> 00:56:15.493]  He talks about his concern about protecting police.
[00:56:15.573 --> 00:56:19.815]  Well, we can see how well that's done for police and citizens.
[00:56:19.855 --> 00:56:23.877]  Yeah, highest death rate for cops in New York, L.A., and Chicago.
[00:56:24.177 --> 00:56:25.398]  Exactly.
[00:56:25.478 --> 00:56:27.599]  Hasn't done a bit of good for police or citizens.
[00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:29.140]  The average guy.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.381]  They've done major polls, though, of the rank-and-file cops.
[00:56:32.401 --> 00:56:38.424]  What, 97% believe in the Second Amendment, want no gun control, but that 3% is the leadership.
[00:56:38.464 --> 00:56:39.365]  They all want gun control.
[00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:45.774]  Apparently Gonzalez's brother, who's a cop, is one of those tiny minority.
[00:56:46.234 --> 00:57:06.488]  But my goodness, at a time when we have seen the repudiation by the voters of big government, of big brother sticking his nose into your affairs, and certainly in the area of the Second Amendment, having been a big reason why Republicans are now the majority party, then...
[00:57:07.543 --> 00:57:09.707]  They end up doing something like this.
[00:57:10.107 --> 00:57:11.670]  It's not good politics.
[00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.653]  The Republicans have no excuse.
[00:57:13.693 --> 00:57:17.299]  They've got the legislative, the executive, the judicial, most of the governors.
[00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:19.663]  I mean, we should see the repeal of all this garbage.
[00:57:20.254 --> 00:57:30.198]  We should, and that's certainly our agenda, and that's the kind of thing that we're going to strive mightily to make them vote on to find out who's really with us and who's not.
[00:57:30.499 --> 00:57:32.860]  How do we force Congress to start repealing laws?
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:42.644]  Well, you've got to have a bill in, and happily folks like Ron Paul and some others are going to be putting in legislation to do just that.
[00:57:43.283 --> 00:57:49.928]  And then the next step is we have to move to force votes on those bills once those bills are there.
[00:57:50.768 --> 00:57:55.352]  And one of the problems we're going to have is getting through the Republican-controlled Rules Committee.
[00:57:55.432 --> 00:57:58.854]  And one of the other problems is the national talk shows aren't going to tell conservatives.
[00:57:59.895 --> 00:58:06.520]  Basically, that's not generally been an issue that most of those national talk shows are interested in.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:12.584]  Yeah, it's just the hottest thing next to immigration, but they don't want to touch it because they could actually get gun laws repealed.
[00:58:13.326 --> 00:58:15.629]  Because they're a bunch of closet socialist punks.
[00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:27.684]  It just doesn't seem to have ever lit their candle, and it makes you wonder how much they really understand the political coalition as well as the freedom imperative of people owning guns.
[00:58:29.139 --> 00:58:36.404]  Larry Pratt, God bless you for being on the front lines daily in the eternal fight for human liberty and the right to self-defense.
[00:58:36.744 --> 00:58:38.786]  Gunowners.org, and that toll-free number?
[00:58:39.406 --> 00:58:41.588]  It's 888-888-6GUN.
[00:58:42.008 --> 00:58:42.849]  All right, my friend.
[00:58:42.869 --> 00:58:43.669]  Talk to you soon.
[00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.792]  Keep up the great work, and vio con dios.
[00:58:46.852 --> 00:58:47.512]  Vio con dios.
[00:58:47.552 --> 00:58:47.792]  Thanks.
[00:58:48.052 --> 00:58:48.713]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:49.013 --> 00:58:49.594]  God bless, Larry.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:58.660]  Big Brother
[00:58:59.352 --> 00:59:00.453]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.133 --> 00:59:02.294]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.874 --> 00:59:03.734]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.754 --> 00:59:05.395]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.035 --> 00:59:09.637]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.217 --> 00:59:14.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:22.103]  Coming up, we'll talk about the First Amendment being dismantled, being butchered, Christians being arrested for their political speech.
[00:59:23.944 --> 00:59:26.945]  We'll get into the latest government cover-ups of 9-11 being exposed.
[00:59:28.809 --> 00:59:30.190]  We'll take more of your calls.
[00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:35.774]  We'll tell you about the new national ID card legislation that sailed to the House yesterday going to the Senate.
[00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:40.618]  But right now, let's get some of these great callers out of the way that have been holding since time immemorial.
[00:59:41.499 --> 00:59:43.720]  Let's talk to Sean in Alabama.
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:44.381]  You're on the air.
[00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:44.881]  Go ahead.
[00:59:45.242 --> 00:59:46.002]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.283]  It's great to talk to you again.
[00:59:47.343 --> 00:59:48.104]  Good to talk to you.
[00:59:48.124 --> 00:59:53.908]  Yeah, I'm glad you brought up the national ID card.
[00:59:54.909 --> 00:59:57.551]  I had a chance to call... The national ID card, B-Think.
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.561]  It's being radically expanded.
[00:59:59.581 --> 00:59:59.981]  Go ahead.
[01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:05.604]  Yes, I had a chance to call in to Tony Snow's radio show, of all things, this morning.
[01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.345]  He actually brought this topic up.
[01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:08.805]  Top Socialist Lord.
[01:00:08.825 --> 01:00:16.189]  Yeah, what was interesting is that he was, I don't know where he's going to go with it, but he was actually talking about it might not be such a good thing.
[01:00:16.249 --> 01:00:17.910]  Oh, that's good.
[01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:19.050]  He's being forced to tell the truth.
[01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.091]  Well, I stand corrected.
[01:00:20.671 --> 01:00:26.114]  Well, what I was telling him, I said, you know, what most people aren't aware of is that
[01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:39.969]  These RFIP chips, it's the exact same thing that's in the Verichip, and that they're moving to market a version that can be tracked by GPS satellite, and that these things are going to be linked to online databases.
[01:00:40.009 --> 01:00:42.491]  It's all going to be linked into the new national sales tax.
[01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:44.273]  Let's admit it.
[01:00:44.894 --> 01:00:52.681]  I think it's a good thing that someone in the mainstream media actually finally brought this up as a legitimate topic, but what was disheartening...
[01:00:53.496 --> 01:00:54.217]  Well, that's not true.
[01:00:54.237 --> 01:00:55.658]  They can't track you on the Sirius Radio.
[01:01:12.361 --> 01:01:15.262]  Well, the guy was being facetious, I think.
[01:01:15.282 --> 01:01:15.922]  No, I understand.
[01:01:15.942 --> 01:01:16.422]  They're idiots.
[01:01:16.662 --> 01:01:22.384]  And no, the transponders are hooked to the cell towers for satellite uplinks, the toll road transponders.
[01:01:22.744 --> 01:01:26.726]  Swarcy and others are trying to put them in the cars with satellite boxes to tax.
[01:01:27.346 --> 01:01:29.567]  And, I mean, this thing's got DNA databases in it.
[01:01:29.607 --> 01:01:30.227]  It's got everything.
[01:01:30.247 --> 01:01:35.909]  Well, yeah, it's linked to everything on the Internet because it's a unique identifier that can be linked to a database.
[01:01:36.129 --> 01:01:39.590]  It's the worst applications of a national ID card out of the gates.
[01:01:40.231 --> 01:01:44.795]  Exactly, and what got me was the callers that called in to him after me.
[01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.117]  They call you a liberal?
[01:01:48.238 --> 01:02:01.089]  No, actually they didn't call me a liberal, but they just can't see how being tracked 24-7 and having your information all in a database and everything, they can't see what the problem is with it.
[01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:03.783]  Can't they understand that it gives waivers to the illegals?
[01:02:03.823 --> 01:02:05.364]  They're not even going to be under this.
[01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:05.945]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:05.965 --> 01:02:06.465]  All right.
[01:02:06.585 --> 01:02:07.806]  I'm glad you called into that show.
[01:02:07.826 --> 01:02:08.326]  God bless you.
[01:02:08.586 --> 01:02:09.407]  Bill in Ohio.
[01:02:09.467 --> 01:02:10.167]  Bill, go ahead.
[01:02:10.187 --> 01:02:11.988]  Hello?
[01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:12.549]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:13.389 --> 01:02:16.471]  Listen, something just occurred to me a moment ago.
[01:02:16.531 --> 01:02:19.653]  I thought I'd ask you if you happen to know.
[01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:29.979]  I keep hearing people talk about these RFID chips, and I don't much like the idea, but I'm wondering...
[01:02:30.749 --> 01:02:35.211]  How would you go about frustrating that thing?
[01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:43.656]  If you put your clothes in the microwave, they're now being woven into hundreds of brands of clothes, you don't even know about it, they will pop.
[01:02:46.457 --> 01:02:47.698]  Really?
[01:02:48.038 --> 01:02:50.279]  The clothes probably wouldn't look like much after that.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.041]  Would a magnetic field have any effect on it at all?
[01:02:54.682 --> 01:02:56.182]  I do a fair amount of... Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:02:56.222 --> 01:02:59.903]  I'm not an engineer, but yeah, a strong enough magnet would probably screw up the system.
[01:03:00.203 --> 01:03:01.584]  Well, I do a fair amount of recording.
[01:03:01.604 --> 01:03:03.844]  The idea is not to frustrate it at the ground level.
[01:03:03.924 --> 01:03:07.245]  The idea is to defeat them, shifting us over into this.
[01:03:07.545 --> 01:03:11.946]  Certainly, but once you've got something that you know has that in there, I'm just wondering.
[01:03:12.547 --> 01:03:17.948]  I have a pretty stout demagnifier, a tape eraser.
[01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:27.327]  The field on that thing, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't stout enough to lift the weight of a bowling ball if you had something that was magnetic metal, iron, or steel.
[01:03:27.927 --> 01:03:28.948]  It's a pretty stout magnet.
[01:03:28.988 --> 01:03:33.351]  Yeah, but we don't want to get to the point where we're having to all erase everything we buy.
[01:03:33.371 --> 01:03:37.554]  And a lot of stuff, you couldn't erase it because it would erase whatever else was on it.
[01:03:38.455 --> 01:03:44.719]  With consumer electronic products and stuff, which are all going to have RFID embedded in them.
[01:03:45.559 --> 01:03:46.520]  I'll explain it all later.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.361]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:47.401 --> 01:03:47.821]  We'll be back.
[01:03:53.565 --> 01:03:57.909]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.089 --> 01:04:02.513]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:07.017]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:08.439]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.139 --> 01:04:10.080]  Can emerge.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.444]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.504 --> 01:04:21.431]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.551 --> 01:04:23.573]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.933 --> 01:04:34.375]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.555 --> 01:04:39.956]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:54.620]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:54.981 --> 01:05:00.705]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:00.985 --> 01:05:06.129]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.449 --> 01:05:15.736]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.076 --> 01:05:21.019]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:25.361]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:25.581 --> 01:05:30.364]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:30.704 --> 01:05:36.507]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:05:53.306 --> 01:05:55.647]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.907 --> 01:05:59.749]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.889]  Read the labels.
[01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:05.452]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.652 --> 01:06:09.854]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:15.096]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:15.476 --> 01:06:19.078]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:19.258 --> 01:06:24.601]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.861 --> 01:06:27.602]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.375]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.845 --> 01:07:16.546]  All right, we're 8 minutes 20 seconds into this second hour on this Friday edition.
[01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:19.966]  I'm honored to be your host, humbled, glad to be here.
[01:07:20.406 --> 01:07:23.347]  Coming up, new 9-11 cover-ups are becoming public.
[01:07:24.027 --> 01:07:35.269]  We'll also get into the new Super National ID card the conservatives were lied to by the White House, telling them that it was to stop illegal aliens, actually makes it easier for illegal aliens as usual.
[01:07:36.229 --> 01:07:41.630]  And just a host, a whole host of other important issues that we're going to discuss.
[01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:46.171]  And I know we have the phone lines loaded up as well.
[01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:47.072]  We'll get to your calls.
[01:07:47.172 --> 01:07:53.653]  But a few months ago we had on Michael Markavich, and he is the director of Repent America.
[01:07:54.053 --> 01:07:56.574]  RepentAmerica.com is the website.
[01:07:56.894 --> 01:08:04.676]  You can link through at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv, but we have it posted right there on the main page of Infowars.com.
[01:08:06.104 --> 01:08:12.687]  And for those that have heard about this story secondhand, you may not believe it.
[01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:15.408]  We have Associated Press articles.
[01:08:15.868 --> 01:08:18.269]  We have Philadelphia Daily News articles.
[01:08:18.909 --> 01:08:24.171]  We have mainstream news reporting on this like it's a good idea, admitting this has happened.
[01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:34.015]  We've got a small group of Christians in a designated protest area at the, quote, Outfest in Philadelphia.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:55.417]  Praying on the street corner, and the police said, that could cause the outfest people to become angry and hurt their feelings, so we're going to arrest you under the Justice Department's advice, and we're going to put you in jail, and then we're going to charge you with basically being terrorists, and you're going to face 47 years in prison.
[01:08:56.577 --> 01:09:01.962]  And so preemptively the group went and appealed this to a federal judge, and the judge said, no, you're going down.
[01:09:02.617 --> 01:09:09.040]  And they've got video they shot themselves, the police are all there as witnesses, even some apologized at the jail and said, we don't know why you were arrested.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.381]  This is the new freedom.
[01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:16.523]  And almost everybody Bush is putting in his Justice Department are out Clinton and Clinton.
[01:09:17.263 --> 01:09:24.246]  My weekly TV report that I did a few nights ago, it'll be going up on prisonplanet.tv either tonight or tomorrow.
[01:09:24.266 --> 01:09:27.087]  I know they just uploaded it, but we've got to post it.
[01:09:28.083 --> 01:09:38.310]  It goes back through the late 80s and 90s under Bush Sr., Bush Reno, and others, and I've got video of them breaking Christians' arms who were sitting in front of abortion clinics.
[01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:43.714]  I mean, taking nunchucks and twisting the arm until it breaks, torturing women, macing babies.
[01:09:44.194 --> 01:09:46.255]  That was acceptable to the liberals.
[01:09:46.335 --> 01:09:47.596]  They loved it.
[01:09:47.676 --> 01:09:48.537]  They praised it.
[01:09:49.528 --> 01:09:54.812]  Crowds spitting and screaming and laughing at the Christians cheering the police on as they did this.
[01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:59.675]  Now the left doesn't like it when this happens to them and they're getting arrested, they're getting beat up for no reason.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.741]  Across the board, we're all losing our First Amendment.
[01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:07.323]  And a lot of conservatives say, fine, let the liberals lose their First Amendment.
[01:10:07.343 --> 01:10:08.423]  No, then we lose ours.
[01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:12.885]  But the most brutal abuse of the First Amendment is against Christians.
[01:10:13.565 --> 01:10:15.586]  And joining me is Michael Markavage.
[01:10:16.366 --> 01:10:18.587]  Michael, it's an honor to have you on.
[01:10:18.627 --> 01:10:23.849]  And we are talking to one of the premier thought criminals in America today.
[01:10:24.689 --> 01:10:25.970]  And God bless you, my friend.
[01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:29.351]  Well, thank you so much, Alex, for covering this story, how important it is.
[01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:34.254]  For those that just joined us and have never heard what happened, encapsulate it.
[01:10:34.614 --> 01:10:35.394]  You've got the floor.
[01:10:35.434 --> 01:10:43.216]  In about five minutes, what you've been through, what's happened to you at city council meetings, what's happened to you in Philadelphia, what your group is now facing.
[01:10:43.256 --> 01:10:45.016]  In five minutes, encapsulate it for us.
[01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:48.817]  Well, every year in Philadelphia, they have what's called an outfest.
[01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:55.259]  It's a national coming out day where thousands of homosexuals are in the streets of Philadelphia, an eight-block area, which is open to the public.
[01:10:55.299 --> 01:10:56.239]  There's businesses there.
[01:10:56.279 --> 01:10:57.019]  There's homes there.
[01:10:57.699 --> 01:10:59.920]  So they can't shut down the whole area, but
[01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.843]  We were there last year without incident.
[01:11:02.863 --> 01:11:07.665]  Well, this year things changed, and our group of 11 people went into the outfest.
[01:11:07.685 --> 01:11:09.146]  By this year, you mean 2004.
[01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:09.546]  2004, yes.
[01:11:10.326 --> 01:11:18.669]  In October of 2004, we went into the outfest as we did last year, but things changed in regards to how the police handled us.
[01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:27.593]  They allowed a militant mob of homosexuals to blow ear-piercing whistles to block us with pink placards, and then they arrested us.
[01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:40.169]  Ages 17 to 72, placed us in paddy wagons, took us to jail for 21 hours, and we were charged with three felonies and five misdemeanors with the potential of being in prison for up to 47 years.
[01:11:43.001 --> 01:11:43.801]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:44.261 --> 01:11:47.002]  But I want to go back over what happened at the South Fest.
[01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:49.422]  How the police, you were authorized to be there, First Amendment.
[01:11:49.442 --> 01:11:55.163]  Then they said, go to this special designated zone for you, which was a total violation the courts have even stated.
[01:11:55.443 --> 01:11:57.203]  So they send you off to this special area.
[01:11:57.464 --> 01:11:59.184]  Blow by blow, tell us what happened.
[01:11:59.704 --> 01:12:05.885]  Well, when we first arrived, we were blocked by this mob of homosexuals who joined arms to block the sidewalk.
[01:12:06.325 --> 01:12:07.665]  So we could not walk down it.
[01:12:08.265 --> 01:12:11.726]  And the police did break them up after about five to ten minutes.
[01:12:12.341 --> 01:12:16.603]  We then crossed the street and we were singing a hymn on that corner.
[01:12:17.283 --> 01:12:20.645]  Then immediately the police said, well, you can't stand here.
[01:12:20.705 --> 01:12:21.565]  You've got to keep moving.
[01:12:22.446 --> 01:12:25.047]  So we went down to the next area where they told us we can go.
[01:12:25.587 --> 01:12:33.491]  We stopped there and they said that after a little bit of time that we were there, you either leave or you're going to be arrested.
[01:12:34.151 --> 01:12:35.692]  And we said, well, we're not going to leave the event.
[01:12:36.232 --> 01:12:40.594]  The police then put us under arrest and we were charged later on.
[01:12:41.405 --> 01:12:47.589]  But what's remarkable about this is that in the beginning when we first arrived, I had asked the officer, I said, where can we go?
[01:12:47.649 --> 01:12:53.913]  Just trying to appease his pride in some way, because we have every right to be there in that eight-block area.
[01:12:53.933 --> 01:12:56.075]  It's all city Philadelphia blocks.
[01:12:56.095 --> 01:13:01.258]  There's no private property there other than the homes and businesses, and we were on the sidewalk.
[01:13:01.338 --> 01:13:07.622]  But they said you can go wherever you want, public sidewalks, public street, and that soon changed when we found ourselves under arrest.
[01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.852]  And by the way, you've got video of this.
[01:13:09.872 --> 01:13:11.633]  A lot of this video is on your website.
[01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:12.973]  In fact, I've just got an idea.
[01:13:14.534 --> 01:13:16.875]  I've watched it before, but it's been weeks.
[01:13:17.195 --> 01:13:18.155]  About a month since I watched it.
[01:13:18.215 --> 01:13:26.359]  How long is... What particular clip could we go to your website right now and download and record and then maybe play on air?
[01:13:27.159 --> 01:13:31.401]  You can do that with... Any part of that would be fine.
[01:13:31.661 --> 01:13:35.383]  It was recorded by an independent film company called Enough Said Productions.
[01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.549]  We're good to go.
[01:13:47.498 --> 01:13:59.163]  I'll tell you what, I'm telling my great crew, go to repentamerica.com, and folks, please don't rush there yourself and watch it, or it might slow the server down, and then when we record it, it'll have a little breakup and stuff that happens with computer buffering.
[01:13:59.743 --> 01:14:06.185]  But go there right now for me, and record that, and we'll play that later, if it comes out good.
[01:14:07.926 --> 01:14:11.027]  If you say, your judgment of the audio is good enough after we transfer it.
[01:14:12.108 --> 01:14:12.268]  Now...
[01:14:13.254 --> 01:14:17.796]  Michael, I want to digress and then get more into what's happened in the court case since then.
[01:14:17.836 --> 01:14:18.797]  It gets worse.
[01:14:19.137 --> 01:14:24.039]  Let's go back to some of the other first amendment violations you've enjoyed at city council meetings.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.620]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.920]  I'm about to stand trial.
[01:14:27.281 --> 01:14:30.962]  We're on two-hour notice for a trial in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania.
[01:14:30.982 --> 01:14:33.624]  It's the town I live in outside of Philadelphia.
[01:14:34.324 --> 01:14:40.727]  And the council meeting was taking place on July 21st where certain council members...
[01:14:41.266 --> 01:14:47.572]  I object to that because of what the scripture says, and I began to read the scripture, and before I could even do that,
[01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:05.891]  It was labeled hate speech by the council president.
[01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:08.392]  And that was in your three-minute citizens' communication?
[01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:09.033]  Oh, yes.
[01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:10.693]  It was during the public comment period.
[01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:19.317]  And someone spoke before me at great length, and I was within... Well, this was in the mainstream news, that he got up for his little thing, read out of the Bible, and was arrested.
[01:15:19.337 --> 01:15:24.040]  Now, a Republican governor two years ago passed hate crimes laws in your state.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.600]  That's why they're doing this, and it's sad.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:30.603]  And they warned preachers, read from the Old Testament, you could be arrested, and now there's no...
[01:15:31.523 --> 01:15:34.326]  No coincidence that this is now happening in Pennsylvania.
[01:15:35.007 --> 01:15:36.508]  Yeah, it's absolutely astonishing.
[01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:41.774]  It's funny because I was also reading from the New Testament, so I guess it came a little bit further.
[01:15:42.787 --> 01:15:45.929]  And Romans 1 is where I was going to read from.
[01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.312]  Would you like to read that later on the air?
[01:15:50.492 --> 01:15:51.352]  Sure, I'd be happy to.
[01:15:51.552 --> 01:15:54.774]  And the reason we're going to do this, folks, is I defend the liberals' free speech.
[01:15:54.854 --> 01:15:59.777]  I defend anybody's free speech, even Ward Churchill's horrible free speech.
[01:15:59.957 --> 01:16:01.378]  I have my free speech to counter him.
[01:16:01.678 --> 01:16:05.781]  But I've been, say, at A Million Mom, which I really dubbed the 100 Bureaucrat March.
[01:16:06.281 --> 01:16:07.401]  In Austin, we have video of this.
[01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:08.122]  It's on the website.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:26.094]  They're hitting me on the head with signs, they're pushing me, they're walking up to my $5,000 camera, spraying water directly on the lens, dousing it in water, and the cops run over and threaten to arrest us, saying, well, you being here makes them angry, and so it's going to be your fault if they assault you some more.
[01:16:27.195 --> 01:16:29.197]  Now, where's the First Amendment, people?
[01:16:31.058 --> 01:16:36.743]  Even if you hate what Mr. Mark Cabbage is saying, shouldn't you love his First Amendment?
[01:16:36.803 --> 01:16:37.644]  Comments to that, Mark?
[01:16:38.522 --> 01:16:39.882]  Well, it's... I mean, Michael, excuse me.
[01:16:39.942 --> 01:16:40.663]  I apologize.
[01:16:41.243 --> 01:16:51.046]  I've been in environments where I have been with those who are completely opposed to what I have to say and what the Bible says and find myself even arrested with them.
[01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:58.808]  And the Republican National Convention was an example of that, where I spent 32 hours in jail with anarchists and...
[01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.416]  Homosexuals and anti-war protesters.
[01:17:02.996 --> 01:17:10.218]  We were all victimized by this brutal government that we're finding more and more opposed to our civil liberties.
[01:17:10.518 --> 01:17:17.699]  Listen, I've interviewed American Spectator writers who were standing peaceably on the street corner and arrested and then falsely charged and later the cops admitted it.
[01:17:17.959 --> 01:17:20.340]  I've talked to AP reporters, Pacifica reporters.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.903]  I was there three times a day being threatened with arrest, and I just say, do it.
[01:17:24.163 --> 01:17:25.304]  I'm going to sue you personally.
[01:17:25.504 --> 01:17:27.546]  I'm going to own your house, and they'd back off.
[01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.268]  That's the only thing they'd listen to.
[01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:32.471]  Unbelievable.
[01:17:32.531 --> 01:17:34.692]  So tell us what else happened at the city council meeting.
[01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:37.895]  Well, I was at the city council meeting, and I had the scripture ready.
[01:17:38.896 --> 01:17:47.344]  Basically, I was about to read from Romans 1, verse 18, through some of the rest of this chapter.
[01:17:47.384 --> 01:17:47.624]  It says,
[01:17:48.075 --> 01:17:59.582]  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shoot it unto them.
[01:18:00.122 --> 01:18:10.168]  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even as eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.
[01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:17.172]  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful, but became vain in their imaginations,
[01:18:17.682 --> 01:18:19.142]  And their foolish heart was darkened.
[01:18:19.642 --> 01:18:29.005]  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like the corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.
[01:18:29.545 --> 01:18:42.628]  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanliness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves, who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever.
[01:18:42.688 --> 01:18:42.948]  Amen.
[01:18:43.567 --> 01:18:50.212]  For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections, for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.
[01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:50.892]  Stay there.
[01:18:50.932 --> 01:18:51.733]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:55.315 --> 01:18:55.856]  Hi, folks.
[01:18:55.896 --> 01:18:57.657]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.677 --> 01:18:58.958]  The real money, folks.
[01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:03.939]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:05.020]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.080]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:06.620]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.081]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[01:19:09.101 --> 01:19:10.981]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.462]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:19:12.482 --> 01:19:13.942]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.756 --> 01:19:32.798]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.782]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.563 --> 01:22:03.164]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:22:03.204 --> 01:22:03.944]  Supreme Court.
[01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:09.016]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:12.679]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.944]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:22:19.725 --> 01:22:28.012]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:23:00.938 --> 01:23:05.862]  Coming up, we're going to play the seven-minute clip of their arrest at the Outfest in Philadelphia.
[01:23:05.882 --> 01:23:12.346]  Then we've got a one-minute clip where he's reading the Bible passage and is then arrested at the city council.
[01:23:12.386 --> 01:23:15.208]  And that clip's not quite as good as this other one, but we'll play it.
[01:23:15.548 --> 01:23:18.430]  The point is, even if you hate the Bible, which I don't hate the Bible.
[01:23:18.450 --> 01:23:18.950]  I'm a Christian.
[01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:19.491]  I love the Bible.
[01:23:19.711 --> 01:23:21.692]  I don't like what the fake neocon Christians do, though.
[01:23:22.233 --> 01:23:23.633]  You ask me, they're anti-Christ.
[01:23:23.654 --> 01:23:24.194]  But the point is...
[01:23:24.887 --> 01:23:29.292]  The passage that Michael was just reading is what he was arrested for.
[01:23:29.792 --> 01:23:30.733]  You understand, folks?
[01:23:30.753 --> 01:23:35.018]  This is like something out of Soviet Russia or communist China today.
[01:23:35.078 --> 01:23:36.980]  This is really going on.
[01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:38.362]  This is admitted.
[01:23:38.402 --> 01:23:39.082]  This is happening.
[01:23:39.763 --> 01:23:43.427]  Please finish reading the thought crime that you were reading earlier, Michael.
[01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:46.891]  Yes, I'll continue reading the hate speech, as they called it.
[01:23:47.546 --> 01:23:59.432]  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanliness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves, who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever.
[01:23:59.512 --> 01:23:59.732]  Amen.
[01:24:00.319 --> 01:24:07.003]  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections, for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.
[01:24:07.483 --> 01:24:19.750]  And likewise, also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was me.
[01:24:20.391 --> 01:24:27.315]  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient."
[01:24:27.955 --> 01:24:28.755]  And then it goes on.
[01:24:29.476 --> 01:24:30.936]  But that was the scripture I was going to read.
[01:24:30.956 --> 01:24:32.336]  How much were you able to read?
[01:24:32.817 --> 01:24:35.097]  I just started, and they said we're not going to have that.
[01:24:36.518 --> 01:24:39.019]  Well, I mean, the first part doesn't even mention anything.
[01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:40.899]  So how far did you get?
[01:24:40.919 --> 01:24:42.740]  We're going to play the clip, but how far did you get?
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:43.920]  I didn't even get to start.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.681]  As soon as I began to read from the scriptures, they made motions to adjourn the meeting.
[01:24:48.662 --> 01:24:49.422]  Now, again, folks.
[01:24:50.217 --> 01:24:52.262]  Some idiots out there think separation of church and state.
[01:24:52.583 --> 01:25:00.320]  You have your free speech to read the Vedas, the Buddhist stuff, to read the Bible, or to read the back of a Cracker Jack box.
[01:25:01.081 --> 01:25:09.805]  You know, you can do whatever you want, but again, he was arrested for this, and then the city council man, I remember, was in the paper going, this is hateful, and I'm not putting up with it.
[01:25:10.486 --> 01:25:12.367]  I mean, that is crazy, folks.
[01:25:12.887 --> 01:25:16.669]  And so you wonder why anti-war people are being arrested for no reason.
[01:25:16.689 --> 01:25:19.110]  You wonder why this is happening all over the place.
[01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:20.431]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:26.071]  At Outfest, you're there praying, reading out of the Bible.
[01:25:26.091 --> 01:25:28.152]  I mean, this is Imagine Communist China, folks.
[01:25:28.593 --> 01:25:36.597]  And now you're facing with others 47 years in prison, despite the fact that you have a professional film crew there videotaping everything that happened.
[01:25:36.617 --> 01:25:37.337]  You did nothing.
[01:25:38.518 --> 01:25:39.258]  Absolutely not.
[01:25:39.338 --> 01:25:40.799]  And that's what's astonishing about this.
[01:25:40.899 --> 01:25:42.320]  The video speaks for itself.
[01:25:42.992 --> 01:25:58.062]  The judge in the hearing that we had on a motion to remove the bail restriction, because the preliminary court judge who held us over for trial, four of us over for trial, said that we cannot be in 100 feet of any homosexual event.
[01:25:58.702 --> 01:26:04.046]  Well, we actually appealed that to the Common Pleas Court where Pamela Denby, Judge Pamela Denby,
[01:26:04.696 --> 01:26:08.899]  She said that this is unconstitutional restraint on a person's right to speak.
[01:26:09.299 --> 01:26:15.523]  Remove that bail condition so it does enable us now to be in 100 feet of any homosexual event.
[01:26:16.143 --> 01:26:18.705]  But she said if you don't like it, you can go to another country.
[01:26:18.905 --> 01:26:21.826]  So this judge understands the value of the First Amendment.
[01:26:22.307 --> 01:26:26.069]  But now you went to the federal courts, though, to try to throw all this out.
[01:26:26.089 --> 01:26:26.509]  What happened?
[01:26:26.809 --> 01:26:32.953]  Well, yeah, we asked a federal judge that this is in bad faith and a retaliation for us exercising our First Amendment rights.
[01:26:33.513 --> 01:26:34.254]  And this judge...
[01:26:35.104 --> 01:26:41.769]  ...decided, well, I'm not going to intervene and I'm going to allow this to continue, which doesn't, in fact, establish a bad precedent as well.
[01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:46.853]  This is a clear case of us exercising First Amendment and being victimized because of that.
[01:26:47.534 --> 01:26:53.959]  Now, I've read what the prosecutors, the federal prosecutors that are advising them how to do this to you, I've read what they've said.
[01:26:54.299 --> 01:27:01.885]  And to paraphrase it, and you can read the actual quotes if you'd like, they say, well, by them being there, they could have made the other group angry, they could have done something violent,
[01:27:02.505 --> 01:27:06.829]  And basically they're claiming you were yelling fire in the theater by criticizing someone.
[01:27:07.009 --> 01:27:10.853]  So now criticizing anybody in any way is illegal.
[01:27:11.774 --> 01:27:28.569]  Yes, indeed, and that's what's so sad about this, is that simply by saying repent for the kingdom of God is at hand, some of these scripture verses, quoting them in public at an event where people are celebrating, can be considered to be a hate crime, and that's what's so dangerous about hate crime legislation.
[01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:30.469]  Oh yeah, was that a side street?
[01:27:30.489 --> 01:27:32.630]  We stopped in the middle of the street in Philadelphia.
[01:27:51.214 --> 01:27:59.763]  So they heard you to a spot, and then lying all the way, planning to arrest you for no reason, and once they got you there, they loaded you up.
[01:28:00.063 --> 01:28:01.464]  Yes, that's exactly what happened.
[01:28:02.765 --> 01:28:09.091]  And that's what's so disturbing about this, is that it was clear that what they did that day was planned in advance.
[01:28:09.332 --> 01:28:15.758]  And now it's come out that federal magistrates, federal prosecutors, were there advising the locals.
[01:28:16.593 --> 01:28:16.913]  Correct.
[01:28:16.973 --> 01:28:19.176]  They were advising them and telling them what they should do.
[01:28:19.696 --> 01:28:28.505]  In fact, someone in the Department of Justice, we found out that there was a report that they were advising, the Department of Justice was advising the Philadelphia police to arrest us.
[01:28:28.665 --> 01:28:31.087]  And I would look for that person to be promoted by Bush.
[01:28:31.628 --> 01:28:31.848]  Right.
[01:28:32.549 --> 01:28:37.574]  If it follows the past actions, past history.
[01:28:38.134 --> 01:28:40.457]  We'll be back with these clips and a lot more in your calls.
[01:28:42.646 --> 01:28:43.548]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:45.653]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.575 --> 01:28:49.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.702 --> 01:29:00.204]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.604 --> 01:29:04.845]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.085 --> 01:29:12.127]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:12.487 --> 01:29:18.609]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:18.749 --> 01:29:19.949]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:20.009 --> 01:29:22.291]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:24.333]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:24.593 --> 01:30:28.114]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:31:31.656 --> 01:31:32.316]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[01:31:57.179 --> 01:31:59.100]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:59.581 --> 01:32:02.403]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.905 --> 01:32:06.326]  Alright, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:06.386 --> 01:32:20.115]  We're going to play this little minute and a half clip, which is terrible audio, but you can still understand it, where Mr. Michael Markavage just is calmly talking, so you can hear what he said, and then they come and arrest him.
[01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:22.337]  Again, this was in the newspaper and the Associated Press as well.
[01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:23.722]  This really happened.
[01:32:23.742 --> 01:32:36.094]  And then we're going to play the seven-minute clip, which is very clear audio, and we'll be, you know, during parts that are just chanting in the background, we'll be cutting in with comments as it continues to roll at the Outfest in Philadelphia.
[01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:38.075]  So that's coming up here in just about a minute or so.
[01:32:38.716 --> 01:32:45.182]  Before we go to those clips, though, I'm a documentary filmmaker, and seeing is believing.
[01:32:45.242 --> 01:32:46.443]  I've made 11 films.
[01:32:46.704 --> 01:32:48.165]  They're all very powerful.
[01:32:49.019 --> 01:32:50.599]  Take America Destroyed by Design.
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.280]  We show what really happened in Oklahoma City.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:52.940]  We show the U.N.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.681]  taking over the national parks.
[01:32:54.721 --> 01:32:59.402]  We get into the cashless society control grid where I protest at the DMV and I'm arrested.
[01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:03.223]  I'm there with 100 protesters against the thumb scanners that went in.
[01:33:03.343 --> 01:33:04.363]  Dynamic footage.
[01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:07.184]  That's just 20 minutes of the 2-hour, 5-minute film.
[01:33:07.704 --> 01:33:09.585]  And there's about 10 other things in that film.
[01:33:09.665 --> 01:33:13.446]  I can't describe everything that's in my first video, and some people say my best.
[01:33:13.966 --> 01:33:16.347]  America Destroyed by Design.
[01:33:17.188 --> 01:33:19.789]  Then there's dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:19.829 --> 01:33:21.550]  You want to know what Bush does at Skull and Bones?
[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:25.951]  Well, we snuck into one of the meetings at Bohemian Grove, and we've got them worshiping Moloch.
[01:33:26.411 --> 01:33:29.273]  You may not believe in God, but they certainly do, and they believe in the bad one.
[01:33:30.233 --> 01:33:34.995]  Folks, you need to see dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:35.575 --> 01:33:39.356]  Speaking of homosexuality, where they bus in the male prostitutes to, quote, service them.
[01:33:39.396 --> 01:33:41.157]  That's the New York Post just last year.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:42.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:42.621 --> 01:33:43.441]  Top gay porn stars.
[01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:44.182]  They're servicing them.
[01:33:44.982 --> 01:33:46.664]  You need to see this for yourselves, folks.
[01:33:46.684 --> 01:33:48.105]  You need to see this video for yourselves.
[01:33:48.485 --> 01:33:51.548]  My 9-11 Road to Tyranny and Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[01:33:51.888 --> 01:33:53.569]  My latest film, American Dictators.
[01:33:54.330 --> 01:34:01.776]  Documenting the staged election of 2004 and showing how the false left-right paradigm operates and how Bush and Kerry have almost identical policies.
[01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:04.210]  Another great film you need to have.
[01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:09.713]  You can get some of my best films as low as $5.95 apiece when you order one at the regular price.
[01:34:09.993 --> 01:34:14.754]  We've also got three DVD or VHS specials where you order three and you save $18.
[01:34:15.375 --> 01:34:26.759]  A bunch of great books, other videos by wonderful researchers like George Humphrey, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, Eric Huffman's video, 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[01:34:27.279 --> 01:34:28.701]  We've got a bunch of different specials.
[01:34:28.881 --> 01:34:32.664]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:32.705 --> 01:34:35.047]  Peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[01:35:00.228 --> 01:35:01.349]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:35:01.789 --> 01:35:02.389]  Don't wait.
[01:35:02.749 --> 01:35:03.529]  Take action.
[01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:04.270]  Get the films.
[01:35:04.330 --> 01:35:05.891]  Make copies of the titles I produced.
[01:35:06.271 --> 01:35:07.371]  Put them on AXS TV.
[01:35:07.451 --> 01:35:08.352]  Show them at your church.
[01:35:08.812 --> 01:35:09.852]  Wake people up.
[01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:24.099]  Now, you can also go to prisonplanet.tv, and you can watch all the films online, read my book, other books, other videos, 15 cents a day, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:25.259 --> 01:35:27.960]  We're not going to go to that clip quite yet, so you can go ahead and pop that down.
[01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:29.581]  I can hear that in the background.
[01:35:30.685 --> 01:35:33.847]  We'll go to that here in just a few minutes because I do want to get to your calls.
[01:35:33.907 --> 01:35:54.460]  But Michael Markavage, the director of RepentAmerica.com, who is constantly being arrested for peaceably praying on street corners or trying to go and speak at city council meetings, to make it clear, you and three others are now facing 47 years in prison for what we're about to hear.
[01:35:55.601 --> 01:35:57.242]  And you've shown the video to the judge.
[01:35:57.342 --> 01:35:59.163]  What does the judge say when you show him the video?
[01:35:59.736 --> 01:36:05.519]  Well, at the preliminary hearing, the judge, after viewing the video, decided to hold four of us over for trial.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:15.505]  And in the Common Pleas Court, when the judge removed the bail restriction, which was Judge Pamela Demby, she said that she saw no criminal behavior in the video.
[01:36:18.187 --> 01:36:21.248]  No criminal behavior, but you're still going to trial?
[01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:27.772]  We're still being prosecuted maliciously by Lynn Abraham's office in Philadelphia, who, by the way, is up for re-election.
[01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:35.055]  She is continuing with this prosecution even after the judge looked at this video and said she saw no criminal behavior.
[01:36:35.796 --> 01:36:36.856]  And it's remarkable.
[01:36:37.317 --> 01:36:48.305]  Now again, the major Philadelphia and Pennsylvania newspapers reported and admitted that at the city council last year before this outfest thing happened, you went up, said I'm going to read from the Bible, and they arrested you.
[01:36:48.805 --> 01:36:51.087]  Where does this particular audio clip come from?
[01:36:51.107 --> 01:36:52.648]  Because it's night and day from the other one.
[01:36:53.309 --> 01:36:53.929]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:36:53.969 --> 01:36:54.810]  That came from a
[01:36:56.035 --> 01:37:00.717]  Independent television program that was actually being recorded.
[01:37:00.757 --> 01:37:05.520]  The council meeting was being recorded, and that came directly from the tape.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:09.041]  Though it's poor quality, it really does show what happened.
[01:37:09.061 --> 01:37:14.684]  Yeah, I mean, instead of just believing the newspaper, which said it was great that you were being arrested for doing nothing, again, they're citing the president.
[01:37:14.704 --> 01:37:16.425]  Yes, he did nothing, but we arrest you for it.
[01:37:16.445 --> 01:37:16.845]  It's good.
[01:37:17.145 --> 01:37:18.666]  Let's hear this first clip.
[01:37:18.986 --> 01:37:20.026]  Listen carefully, folks.
[01:37:20.086 --> 01:37:20.606]  Bear with us.
[01:37:21.087 --> 01:37:21.527]  Here it is.
[01:37:23.288 --> 01:37:23.868]  Thanks so much, Patrick.
[01:37:28.988 --> 01:37:30.268]  Good evening.
[01:37:30.289 --> 01:37:32.509]  62 East Stewart Avenue, Lansdowne.
[01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:36.431]  I just wanted to express a couple of things this evening.
[01:37:36.931 --> 01:37:40.092]  First, staying at the direction that the council is leading our community.
[01:37:40.693 --> 01:37:57.439]  I recently read a statement by Mr. Lee, the newly appointed council member in the Philadelphia Gay News, and he has confessed that the gay community in the borough council hopes that this, his appointment, sees more gay and lesbian people moving to town
[01:37:58.007 --> 01:38:06.013]  I'm just, uh, curious if that is the consensus of the council, is that, uh, the desire the council wants to proceed in misleading more gay and lesbian people to the town?
[01:38:06.833 --> 01:38:11.437]  My desire is to have anybody that wants to come to Lansdowne River to be able to come to Lansdowne River.
[01:38:11.837 --> 01:38:12.117]  Okay.
[01:38:12.758 --> 01:38:20.943]  So let me, uh, this, this pertains to the issue here at hand, uh, concerning what the scripture talks about concerning homosexuality.
[01:38:20.983 --> 01:38:23.085]  I'm curious what that, what that says.
[01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:25.171]  We're not there yet.
[01:38:25.271 --> 01:38:37.500]  I'd just like to read the first verse and then I'll sit down and then I'll... My second question is my concern is that what you are doing typically works fine to discriminate against the people.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.640]  I can just read it as it is.
[01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:47.627]  I understand and I'm... Well, that's my... You might be able to limit my time, but the content of my speech, that's not something we can do.
[01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:50.209]  Okay, well then what I'm going to do is limit your time as well.
[01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:52.290]  Okay, well that's just when I said that.
[01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.931]  All right.
[01:38:53.758 --> 01:38:57.901]  I understand, but I'm simply not... You have to stay consistent with the other people.
[01:38:57.921 --> 01:39:04.266]  I understand, but I am not going to allow you to come before this council and use it as a forum to agree.
[01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:05.948]  It's simply not going to happen.
[01:39:05.968 --> 01:39:07.669]  Mr. Council, the Bible does not make sense.
[01:39:07.689 --> 01:39:09.631]  No, but you're looking at it as it is.
[01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:10.952]  I'm just reading it as it is.
[01:39:11.012 --> 01:39:13.193]  I understand, and it is not going to happen.
[01:39:13.674 --> 01:39:19.298]  For this cause, God gives us the Bible effectively, so even the women will change the natural use of it.
[01:39:19.559 --> 01:39:19.819]  Okay.
[01:39:21.624 --> 01:39:23.426]  Okay, and right there, the police grabbing.
[01:39:24.126 --> 01:39:25.567]  Now, again, sorry about that audio.
[01:39:25.828 --> 01:39:27.829]  It was really bad, but you can hear it.
[01:39:28.029 --> 01:39:30.972]  Okay, so the Bible says, no, it's not what you're preaching of it is.
[01:39:31.172 --> 01:39:32.333]  Okay, well, I'm just going to read from it.
[01:39:32.693 --> 01:39:32.913]  No.
[01:39:33.214 --> 01:39:36.196]  And they arrest him, and now you're facing trial for that.
[01:39:36.416 --> 01:39:41.821]  What you just heard, calmly, nicely, they're talking, being arrested.
[01:39:41.901 --> 01:39:44.263]  Is this the America we were all brought up in, Michael?
[01:39:44.943 --> 01:39:48.046]  Well, it's certainly not, and things are definitely on the move toward...
[01:39:48.618 --> 01:39:57.566]  Criminalizing Christianity along with free speech as we see all of us being victimized under this government control of our lives.
[01:39:58.827 --> 01:40:04.312]  Now, the next clip is seven minutes long from the outfist.
[01:40:05.213 --> 01:40:07.555]  Now, this is video.
[01:40:07.575 --> 01:40:09.317]  This is on their website, but here's the audio of it.
[01:40:10.301 --> 01:40:15.684]  Just give us in 30 seconds a synopsis of what happens in the seven minutes so people get a visual idea.
[01:40:16.164 --> 01:40:22.146]  Yes, what they're going to hear is when we arrive, I'm speaking to Enough Said Productions.
[01:40:22.166 --> 01:40:28.649]  They're doing a film on this event and our work in Philadelphia concerning homosexuality.
[01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:32.511]  And you will hear the Pink Angels, perhaps,
[01:40:33.007 --> 01:40:34.928]  And this is what the Klan did to blacks in the South.
[01:40:51.773 --> 01:40:52.834]  Yes, it's very disturbing.
[01:40:53.254 --> 01:41:01.119]  When we look at this tape and we see that the police did nothing to intervene or nothing to stop the harassment, it's quite troubling.
[01:41:01.539 --> 01:41:06.322]  And we find that the Pink Angels were able to block us and then have us arrested.
[01:41:06.462 --> 01:41:08.443]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to this tape.
[01:41:08.503 --> 01:41:13.206]  And again, in areas where it's just background noise, you know the film well, because you've even brought it forward in court.
[01:41:13.606 --> 01:41:18.129]  We're going to keep your mic up, and we're going to let you comment on it.
[01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:19.870]  Here is the tape, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.991]  Can officer...
[01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:27.197]  We've been informed by our attorneys that this is obstruction, that they cannot block the public sidewalk.
[01:41:28.198 --> 01:41:30.121]  It's obstruction of public passageways.
[01:41:30.141 --> 01:41:32.384]  It's a violation of state law.
[01:41:34.147 --> 01:41:34.667]  I do too.
[01:41:35.729 --> 01:41:36.430]  I'll follow you ma'am.
[01:41:38.288 --> 01:41:47.091]  There was an elderly woman trying to cross the street.
[01:41:47.131 --> 01:41:49.972]  This is a violation of Pennsylvania state law.
[01:41:49.992 --> 01:41:51.692]  In fact, I was charged with this before.
[01:41:52.133 --> 01:41:55.974]  Obstructing a public walkway is a violation of state law.
[01:41:56.214 --> 01:41:59.035]  But also, this is also considered harassment.
[01:41:59.095 --> 01:42:02.896]  In the newspaper article in the Philadelphia Gay News, they clearly made it clear
[01:42:03.556 --> 01:42:07.601]  Their point is saying that they're going to have a moving circle around us.
[01:42:07.881 --> 01:42:10.144]  In fact, this is not a moving circle around us at all.
[01:42:10.504 --> 01:42:12.146]  And even that would be harassment.
[01:42:12.186 --> 01:42:15.390]  Notice you are much, much more attractive than anyone behind me.
[01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:18.214]  Oh, we can make babies, sweetie.
[01:42:18.254 --> 01:42:19.835]  Don't you worry about the baby part.
[01:42:20.196 --> 01:42:21.497]  We got the babies.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.322]  We'd like to go away from the stage because it's too loud.
[01:42:27.362 --> 01:42:28.803]  We want to preach our message.
[01:42:28.843 --> 01:42:29.804]  Can we go down that way?
[01:42:29.824 --> 01:42:30.544]  Alright, thank you all.
[01:42:30.564 --> 01:42:31.985]  Now this is pretty loud, the music.
[01:42:32.005 --> 01:42:33.946]  Do you want to move down further this way?
[01:42:59.289 --> 01:43:02.577]  Now at this point, they're standing around him blowing whistles.
[01:43:09.747 --> 01:43:17.892]  Officer, under one condition, I wanted to mention... Officer.
[01:43:18.173 --> 01:43:18.913]  Officer Fisher.
[01:43:18.973 --> 01:43:20.694]  Captain Fisher.
[01:43:20.915 --> 01:43:22.175]  No, wait, wait, wait.
[01:43:22.275 --> 01:43:23.917]  I want to address one thing.
[01:43:24.437 --> 01:43:26.558]  Our attorneys informed us that this is obstruction.
[01:43:26.598 --> 01:43:30.241]  These signs that they're trying to block us, the intent is disorderly.
[01:43:30.361 --> 01:43:33.363]  I'm subject to arrest under one condition.
[01:43:34.964 --> 01:43:37.887]  Your legal counsel said we can't stand here?
[01:43:37.927 --> 01:43:40.029]  We're going to walk down this way with you.
[01:43:40.069 --> 01:43:42.571]  So unless we do, we're going to be arrested, right?
[01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:43.472]  He said, yeah.
[01:43:43.512 --> 01:43:47.255]  Captain Fisher, these signs here and them obstructing our message is illegal.
[01:44:03.288 --> 01:44:11.213]  Well, first of all, they were impeding our way when we came in, which is obstruction of a highway and public passageways under the Pennsylvania state law.
[01:44:14.275 --> 01:44:17.097]  You did correct it, and we appreciate that.
[01:44:17.357 --> 01:44:20.699]  Well, we do too, but at the same time, this here is obstruction.
[01:44:21.179 --> 01:44:28.784]  When they have the signs and trying to block us, and their intent, as they said in the Philadelphia Gay News, is to have us block our message blocks.
[01:44:29.324 --> 01:44:42.315]  At this point they're surrounded by people hissing and sticking signs in front of them and blowing whistles at them.
[01:44:42.355 --> 01:44:44.637]  They're being taken to be arrested.
[01:44:44.677 --> 01:44:48.160]  They're letting the police violate their rights and they're still going to be arrested.
[01:44:56.061 --> 01:45:01.623]  Michael, feel free to comment anytime you wish.
[01:45:02.204 --> 01:45:02.444]  Okay.
[01:45:05.905 --> 01:45:13.548]  We are at the next location where the police said that we should stop and waiting there where there's a side street which would allow those paddy wagons to come in.
[01:45:19.611 --> 01:45:22.532]  And now you go to a Bush demonstration, pro-Bush.
[01:45:22.952 --> 01:45:25.053]  One person shows up with a sign saying they don't like Bush.
[01:45:25.965 --> 01:45:28.305]  They're arrested and charged with felonies.
[01:45:29.946 --> 01:45:31.266]  You see, it's for everybody.
[01:45:31.986 --> 01:45:32.986]  No more First Amendment.
[01:45:34.446 --> 01:45:42.108]  So that they can come through, nobody, but as this big group congregates, they can't do their business that they've paid to have boots for.
[01:45:42.188 --> 01:45:43.628]  And you believe this is the law, correct?
[01:45:43.808 --> 01:45:44.728]  No, I know this is the law.
[01:45:44.748 --> 01:45:46.509]  Okay, so then there's equal protection as well.
[01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:47.509]  Which is why we're here.
[01:45:47.529 --> 01:45:50.689]  So when they have their pink signs around it, did you give them the same message?
[01:45:50.869 --> 01:45:52.330]  They're getting ready to get rid of their signs.
[01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:55.150]  But you didn't tell them that they had to get their signs out of here.
[01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:57.031]  We have to speak to one group at a time.
[01:45:57.191 --> 01:46:04.436]  You're going to get rid of your... We just told you this, and there's going to be no need for their pink signs because you're not going to have your signs.
[01:46:04.916 --> 01:46:06.437]  You're taking our signs away from us?
[01:46:06.797 --> 01:46:11.420]  I'm not taking anything away from you, but I think you understood what the captain just said.
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:17.644]  You're getting ready to get out of the way of these people's booths so that they can conduct business, which is the purpose... We're not trying to block anyone's booth.
[01:46:17.764 --> 01:46:18.705]  Okay, you understood.
[01:46:18.765 --> 01:46:20.226]  Yeah, but however, we have this...
[01:46:20.806 --> 01:46:22.467]  We have this problem of obstruction.
[01:46:22.747 --> 01:46:26.629]  I think these people with the pink signs are blocking us to convey our message.
[01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:29.751]  What we can do, we're not leaving the event.
[01:46:30.251 --> 01:46:31.812]  We're going to walk this way.
[01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:32.872]  We'll get out of this way.
[01:46:33.293 --> 01:46:36.194]  We're not going to walk that way.
[01:46:37.095 --> 01:46:40.997]  What they're trying to do now is try to tell us to leave the event.
[01:46:41.197 --> 01:46:42.637]  Which is in the middle of the city.
[01:46:42.657 --> 01:46:42.858]  Correct.
[01:46:46.915 --> 01:46:48.035]  That was Karen Simmons.
[01:46:48.075 --> 01:46:51.916]  She's the legal advisor to the police that I was just talking with.
[01:46:52.497 --> 01:46:53.917]  All right.
[01:46:54.037 --> 01:46:54.877]  Needs to move to Russia.
[01:46:55.577 --> 01:46:59.558]  We would like to be in an area... What law are we violating?
[01:46:59.738 --> 01:47:00.719]  We'll talk about it up here.
[01:47:00.759 --> 01:47:03.379]  Captain, if he doesn't move soon, call for a wagon.
[01:47:03.419 --> 01:47:04.440]  Call for a wagon.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:06.680]  But these people are obstructing our message.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.500]  We're just walking.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:07.821]  We're not.
[01:47:07.841 --> 01:47:08.621]  For what reason?
[01:47:12.381 --> 01:47:13.241]  So let's walk this way.
[01:47:13.622 --> 01:47:18.264]  Turn around, we're going to walk that way.
[01:47:18.284 --> 01:47:19.784]  Why are they stopping us in the street?
[01:47:20.285 --> 01:47:22.766]  I want to talk to you, Mike.
[01:47:23.526 --> 01:47:28.648]  We're going to a Chinese camp.
[01:47:28.668 --> 01:47:31.630]  Mike, you were told to go to Wall Street.
[01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:33.931]  I was asking what law?
[01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:34.871]  We're obstructing us.
[01:47:34.891 --> 01:47:36.112]  Call an arrest for what?
[01:47:36.692 --> 01:47:38.233]  What law have we filed against you?
[01:47:44.167 --> 01:47:47.068]  They just placed us under arrest, Chief Inspector James Piano.
[01:47:47.368 --> 01:47:48.789]  Are we all under arrest?
[01:47:48.809 --> 01:47:49.669]  We're under arrest.
[01:47:49.749 --> 01:47:50.269]  Everyone?
[01:47:50.289 --> 01:47:51.090]  Yeah, we're under arrest.
[01:47:51.130 --> 01:47:52.470]  Then you can stand up.
[01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:53.611]  You want to stand up?
[01:47:54.031 --> 01:47:56.752]  Come on, let's go!
[01:47:56.852 --> 01:48:01.074]  Hear them cheering?
[01:48:01.314 --> 01:48:02.194]  Arrest them!
[01:48:02.274 --> 01:48:03.375]  Take them to the camp!
[01:48:03.875 --> 01:48:05.515]  Take the Jews to the camp!
[01:48:06.096 --> 01:48:06.796]  Get them!
[01:48:09.898 --> 01:48:12.019]  Men in uniforms, take them for their speech!
[01:48:12.459 --> 01:48:13.519]  Take them to the cap!
[01:48:13.579 --> 01:48:14.780]  Ha ha ha!
[01:48:28.745 --> 01:48:30.526]  And I guess at that point they take your microphone.
[01:48:31.006 --> 01:48:33.967]  Yeah, they took it off and I was put into the paddy wagon.
[01:48:34.487 --> 01:48:36.268]  And as you were able to hear on that,
[01:48:36.758 --> 01:48:38.281]  To your free speech zone!
[01:48:47.702 --> 01:48:50.784]  Well, that's what they're claiming, but there was nothing set up in the very beginning.
[01:48:50.804 --> 01:48:51.245]  No, of course.
[01:48:51.285 --> 01:48:52.406]  It's an open city event.
[01:48:52.686 --> 01:48:53.046]  Of course.
[01:48:53.226 --> 01:49:04.955]  And, you know, you went to places they asked, and that wasn't good enough, and so they took you right to where the paddy wagon was and loaded you up, and now they're... Tell folks real quick, we're about to go to break, all the different charges.
[01:49:05.195 --> 01:49:05.915]  People just heard it.
[01:49:05.955 --> 01:49:07.016]  You can watch what they did.
[01:49:07.537 --> 01:49:10.579]  Absolutely nothing, and they're charging with all this stuff.
[01:49:11.019 --> 01:49:11.840]  Yes, the charges.
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:16.023]  Three felonies, five misdemeanors, ethnic intimidation, riot...
[01:49:17.341 --> 01:49:24.586]  Failure to disperse, reckless endangerment of another person, criminal conspiracy, the list goes on and on.
[01:49:24.726 --> 01:49:28.069]  And did you hear that weird announcer going, oh, we got the children?
[01:49:28.789 --> 01:49:30.230]  Did you hear that weird comment?
[01:49:32.171 --> 01:49:34.113]  Yeah, that was disturbing, very disturbing in the beginning.
[01:49:34.153 --> 01:49:36.134]  What does that mean, oh, that children, we've got them?
[01:49:36.154 --> 01:49:39.936]  Don't you worry, we've got them.
[01:49:39.996 --> 01:49:42.098]  Man, what is going on here?
[01:49:43.986 --> 01:49:45.386]  You talk about Nazis, folks.
[01:49:45.406 --> 01:49:46.827]  This country's going down.
[01:49:47.887 --> 01:49:48.707]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.248 --> 01:49:53.789]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:53.969 --> 01:49:57.069]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:57.189 --> 01:50:01.090]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:01.130 --> 01:50:05.371]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:05.712 --> 01:50:09.492]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:09.572 --> 01:50:11.433]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.614 --> 01:50:19.681]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:22.904]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:23.064 --> 01:50:25.927]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:26.427 --> 01:50:32.533]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.073 --> 01:50:34.614]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:53.294 --> 01:51:04.570]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:08.276]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:51:08.496 --> 01:51:08.836]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.668 --> 01:51:36.613]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:51:48.801 --> 01:51:50.082]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[01:52:53.251 --> 01:53:00.876]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:01.296 --> 01:53:04.438]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:12.611]  Folks, I have video, and we've aired the audio here a year ago, where they're up in North Carolina.
[01:53:12.631 --> 01:53:16.212]  There's about 500 Bush supporters on city streets, city sidewalks.
[01:53:16.652 --> 01:53:23.454]  One guy with a sign saying, no blood for oil, a professor, walks up, and the Secret Service says, arrest him.
[01:53:23.474 --> 01:53:25.355]  Nobody's allowed to be out here protesting Bush.
[01:53:25.395 --> 01:53:26.275]  And the cops go, really?
[01:53:26.575 --> 01:53:27.335]  This is all on tape.
[01:53:27.355 --> 01:53:28.475]  And they go, yeah.
[01:53:28.515 --> 01:53:32.236]  So they go over, arrest him, manhandle him, slam him around the crowd, just cheers.
[01:53:32.896 --> 01:53:34.097]  This is sick, folks.
[01:53:35.037 --> 01:53:35.477]  And again...
[01:53:36.286 --> 01:53:38.208]  The left better get it to their beady brains.
[01:53:38.588 --> 01:53:40.029]  And so have the little neocons.
[01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:42.171]  We're all losing our First Amendment in this country.
[01:53:43.392 --> 01:53:46.315]  The Christians have been taking the brunt of this for a long time.
[01:53:47.015 --> 01:53:52.540]  And you better, no matter what your views are, you better support our guests.
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:54.322]  You better support these political prisoners.
[01:53:54.382 --> 01:53:57.144]  Because it's serious business.
[01:53:58.185 --> 01:53:59.206]  I was threatened.
[01:53:59.798 --> 01:54:03.881]  With my Arnold exposed move, but to expose Swartzenegger, I was threatened out of Tennessee.
[01:54:04.662 --> 01:54:09.986]  A group tried to go to the FBI and have me arrested for our press release that was carried by the Associated Press.
[01:54:10.206 --> 01:54:12.028]  I mean, it was a mild milquetoast press release.
[01:54:12.288 --> 01:54:13.949]  People are already thinking like this.
[01:54:13.989 --> 01:54:15.291]  They think I should be arrested.
[01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:17.452]  This is very, very serious.
[01:54:17.492 --> 01:54:25.659]  And we've got Pastor Ted Pike, an expert on hate crimes legislation, coming up in the next hour with us to talk to Michael and others on air about this.
[01:54:25.679 --> 01:54:27.700]  But right now, let's go to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:54:28.001 --> 01:54:29.022]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:54:29.082 --> 01:54:29.422]  Go ahead.
[01:54:31.363 --> 01:54:32.064]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:54:33.385 --> 01:54:35.126]  Okay, he's got his radio on.
[01:54:35.406 --> 01:54:37.348]  Let's go to Paul in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:54:37.588 --> 01:54:38.369]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:40.370]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:54:40.471 --> 01:54:40.931]  Yes, I can.
[01:54:40.951 --> 01:54:41.351]  Go ahead.
[01:54:41.952 --> 01:54:42.792]  Okay, real quick.
[01:54:43.453 --> 01:54:54.602]  On October the 5th in 2004, you talked to a man from the previous employee of the Texas Department of Transportation who was fired for filming a computer screen with a registration form?
[01:54:54.923 --> 01:54:55.163]  Yes.
[01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:59.638]  At about 10 minutes and 30 seconds into the video, I'm looking at the screen.
[01:54:59.698 --> 01:55:02.199]  It shows place for national ID number.
[01:55:02.959 --> 01:55:04.960]  Above that, it says military status.
[01:55:06.521 --> 01:55:14.825]  And knowing there are no mistakes... No, I know internally the state police databanks and Department of Transportation databanks already say national ID card.
[01:55:15.725 --> 01:55:16.246]  Well, there you go.
[01:55:16.266 --> 01:55:17.066]  There are no mistakes.
[01:55:17.206 --> 01:55:18.166]  This is what they're setting up.
[01:55:19.407 --> 01:55:20.588]  And two quick questions.
[01:55:20.688 --> 01:55:23.349]  First off, would it surprise you at all...
[01:55:24.285 --> 01:55:32.548]  If the government, this occupational tyrannical government, put in a department of thought crimes
[01:55:33.757 --> 01:55:34.538]  They already have, sir.
[01:55:34.598 --> 01:55:35.699]  It's called Homeland Security.
[01:55:35.739 --> 01:55:36.639]  It has whole divisions.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.202]  In England, reporters are arrested for saying the word homosexual.
[01:55:40.242 --> 01:55:41.524]  That's now illegal to say in England.
[01:55:41.644 --> 01:55:44.426]  This is BBC reporters being arrested and others.
[01:55:44.686 --> 01:55:46.288]  And they said because that word is hurtful.
[01:55:46.308 --> 01:55:50.431]  They have the Department of Hate Crimes Division, Scotland Yard.
[01:55:51.192 --> 01:55:53.714]  Let me get a comment from Michael Markavich.
[01:55:53.774 --> 01:55:54.054]  Michael?
[01:55:54.494 --> 01:55:57.457]  Yes, I just got a call from someone in England, a pastor there.
[01:55:57.837 --> 01:56:00.398]  Yeah, it's so sad what we're seeing, and we need to raise our voice.
[01:56:00.478 --> 01:56:03.659]  If we don't, we're going to find ourselves saying something behind bars.
[01:56:03.679 --> 01:56:07.581]  Folks, this is what they do to the Falun Gong and Christians and Buddhists in China.
[01:56:27.228 --> 01:56:29.210]  In fact, anything else, Paul?
[01:56:30.110 --> 01:56:35.034]  It looks like it's been 1984 for 21 years now, and on an unrelated note...
[01:56:35.515 --> 01:56:38.756]  How would you go about opting out of Social Security before it's taken away forever?
[01:56:39.056 --> 01:56:43.376]  That's a whole other subject, sir, and I have to get into that in another show.
[01:56:43.396 --> 01:56:45.057]  I mean, it's a complex issue, but thanks for the call.
[01:56:45.337 --> 01:56:47.957]  Let's bring Ted Pike in here in the last 60 seconds of this hour.
[01:56:48.337 --> 01:56:51.898]  Ted, hearing all of this, being an expert on it, Pastor, give us your comments.
[01:56:52.278 --> 01:57:01.500]  Yes, it's very, very important that our listeners today be aware that the big federal hate bill, which is called the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005...
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.066]  That's HR 259 is now going through the House Judiciary Committee.
[01:57:10.227 --> 01:57:17.835]  We must call our members of Congress immediately, protest this Big Brother legislation, and that toll-free number is 877-762-8762.
[01:57:17.855 --> 01:57:18.276]  That's 877-762-8762.
[01:57:26.084 --> 01:57:26.484]  8-7-6-2.
[01:57:26.504 --> 01:57:30.005]  And again, it's a Republican Congress.
[01:57:30.025 --> 01:57:32.346]  That's why all this is happening, because they know you're asleep.
[01:57:32.446 --> 01:57:33.386]  Stay there, pastors.
[01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:33.926]  Stay there.
[01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:37.227]  Michael Markavage, third hour coming up.
[01:57:37.287 --> 01:57:39.488]  Your call is a ton of news, depending on the First Amendment.
[01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.929]  Terror.
[01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:49.211]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.921 --> 01:57:50.982]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.703 --> 01:57:52.784]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.444 --> 01:57:54.305]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.046 --> 01:57:55.906]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.926 --> 01:58:00.470]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:04.894]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.056 --> 01:58:16.444]  Whether you're an anti-war protester, an environmental protester, a pro-life demonstrator, somebody out at Outfest reading out of the Bible,
[01:58:17.366 --> 01:58:22.631]  You're going to face decades in prison for reading Bible passages or protesting Lord Bush.
[01:58:23.311 --> 01:58:28.016]  It's all part of the new freedom and legislations about to pass the federal government to expand this.
[01:58:29.864 --> 01:58:40.948]  We'll be taking your calls in this hour on this subject and other important topics at 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and Charles and others will be getting your calls.
[01:58:40.988 --> 01:58:56.174]  We're joined by Pastor Ted Pike, an expert on this thought crime legislation, and of course, Michael Markavage, the Executive Director of RepentAmerica.com, who has been arrested in New York City with the peace activists who are standing on the street corner.
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:59:03.324]  He has been arrested for trying to read from the Bible at a city council meeting in his three minutes of citizens' communication.
[01:59:04.205 --> 01:59:07.547]  He's been arrested at Outfest for standing there reading from the Bible.
[01:59:07.868 --> 01:59:09.489]  We played the audio of the video.
[01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:10.569]  The video's on his website.
[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:12.571]  This is the new America.
[01:59:14.392 --> 01:59:25.980]  Going back to Michael Markavich, Michael, you're facing 47 years in prison, and even people in the pre-trial are admitting you committed no crimes, but they're still charging you with, what, three felonies and a bunch of misdemeanors.
[01:59:28.162 --> 01:59:29.463]  I guess it's going to go ahead and go to trial.
[01:59:29.483 --> 01:59:31.104]  You're going to have a jury, and who knows?
[01:59:31.124 --> 01:59:33.685]  The jury might have been watching TV where they tell you, oh, this is good.
[01:59:34.006 --> 01:59:35.667]  You might be spending some time in prison.
[01:59:36.307 --> 01:59:39.429]  Well, we never know with the direction that we find our country in right now.
[01:59:39.949 --> 01:59:48.495]  But I'm also facing 15 months in jail and a $2,800 fine for the Lansdowne incident at the council meeting where I spoke for under two minutes.
[01:59:48.922 --> 01:59:52.805]  They had a 10-minute time limit, and I only spoke for under two minutes.
[01:59:53.646 --> 02:00:01.073]  And we played the city council member, the head of the committee, saying, I'm not going to let you read that out of the Bible, and you're arrested.
[02:00:01.733 --> 02:00:02.054]  Exactly.
[02:00:02.074 --> 02:00:03.555]  And you didn't resist, you did nothing.
[02:00:04.135 --> 02:00:04.616]  Not at all.
[02:00:04.756 --> 02:00:05.997]  And we played it right here for you.
[02:00:06.017 --> 02:00:12.062]  It's been in the news, folks, just openly saying, he came and he tried to read from the Bible, and it's a good thing, he's going to be going to jail.
[02:00:13.163 --> 02:00:16.026]  This is the new America, is it not, Pastor Ted Pike?
[02:00:16.573 --> 02:00:26.196]  Yes, and not only the New America, but these hate laws are spreading throughout the Western world in most European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
[02:00:26.736 --> 02:00:29.657]  Hate laws are the latest legislative trend.
[02:00:30.057 --> 02:00:44.421]  And what makes these laws so pernicious and so threatening to Christians is because they have a basic definition that hate equals bias against federally protected groups, especially against homosexuals.
[02:00:45.081 --> 02:00:56.709]  And, of course, the Bible is full of bias against homosexuality, and that means that Christians who adhere to the Holy Scriptures are almost, by definition, haters.
[02:00:56.809 --> 02:01:04.734]  And now, through the faith-based initiative that Bush has that Hillary supports, they're going to be federally funding all the churches and controlling them, so this is amazing.
[02:01:04.754 --> 02:01:13.500]  But I want to make this clear, because the right loves to take the left's rights, the left loves to take the right's rights, they're taking everybody's rights right now.
[02:01:14.202 --> 02:01:15.845]  This isn't just happening to Christians.
[02:01:15.865 --> 02:01:19.970]  This isn't just happening to family values demonstrators.
[02:01:20.311 --> 02:01:24.437]  Well, you know, a few months ago I called people to look at what had happened in Canada.
[02:01:24.497 --> 02:01:26.760]  We didn't have too many presidents in the United States.
[02:01:27.533 --> 02:01:37.563]  In Canada, it's illegal under the Hate Crimes Law of Canada, Section 319, to even criticize homosexuality in any way on the airwaves.
[02:01:38.004 --> 02:01:40.546]  It means harsh fines, imprisonment.
[02:01:40.986 --> 02:01:44.370]  But here, we have lost our free speech in Philadelphia for the last...
[02:01:44.890 --> 02:01:50.194]  But last year, bad case law was created in federal court in North Carolina with a guy with an anti-Bush sign.
[02:02:02.566 --> 02:02:04.708]  The point is, it's happening across the board.
[02:02:05.208 --> 02:02:15.896]  It is, and that's why it's so imperative right now that we call Congress, because the huge federal hate bill is rapidly moving through the House Judiciary Committee.
[02:02:16.016 --> 02:02:25.483]  It was introduced on January 6th, and if this is passed, it will mean an Orwellian big brother anti-hate bureaucracy for the United States.
[02:02:25.503 --> 02:02:27.745]  Folks, people are going to be arrested.
[02:02:28.165 --> 02:02:29.086]  We're going to be arrested.
[02:02:29.566 --> 02:02:30.267]  This is the plan.
[02:02:30.808 --> 02:02:31.669]  Stay there, Pastor.
[02:02:31.689 --> 02:02:33.010]  Stay there, Michael Markavage.
[02:02:33.331 --> 02:02:34.232]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:02:34.272 --> 02:02:37.576]  I want to get more into this and how we defeated on the other side.
[02:02:37.616 --> 02:02:42.061]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv are two of the websites you need to check out today.
[02:02:44.111 --> 02:02:48.456]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:48.656 --> 02:02:53.081]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:53.201 --> 02:02:57.586]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:57.626 --> 02:02:58.988]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.769 --> 02:03:04.993]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:05.053 --> 02:03:11.999]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:12.119 --> 02:03:14.161]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:14.361 --> 02:03:24.830]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:25.791]  If you want to understand
[02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:26.232]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:26.252 --> 02:03:27.753]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:44.921 --> 02:03:49.445]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:49.765 --> 02:03:53.869]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.710]  We listened.
[02:03:55.010 --> 02:04:00.014]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:00.274 --> 02:04:00.755]  We listened.
[02:04:01.135 --> 02:04:04.198]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:04.618 --> 02:04:05.139]  We listened.
[02:04:05.619 --> 02:04:09.002]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:04:09.042 --> 02:04:09.562]  We're good to go.
[02:04:35.490 --> 02:04:39.091]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:39.111 --> 02:04:42.611]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.332 --> 02:04:53.593]  If your plans include a new building for your business, church, or organization, don't settle for anything less than the quality of General Steel.
[02:04:53.653 --> 02:04:58.714]  General Steel will beat any steel building price of similar size and specifications.
[02:04:58.774 --> 02:05:02.975]  A small deposit will get your project started and lock your price in for up to 90 days.
[02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:03.695]  We're good to go.
[02:05:33.335 --> 02:05:34.095]  Call now.
[02:05:34.115 --> 02:05:34.155]  877-247-1580.
[02:05:34.176 --> 02:05:34.216]  877-247-1580.
[02:05:34.256 --> 02:05:34.496]  Big Brother.
[02:05:34.516 --> 02:05:34.856]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:34.876 --> 02:05:35.496]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:35.536 --> 02:05:36.056]  You want answers?
[02:05:36.076 --> 02:05:36.737]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.741 --> 02:06:00.364]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.924 --> 02:06:05.047]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.148 --> 02:06:09.951]  Eight minutes, 24 seconds into the third hour of this Friday edition.
[02:06:09.971 --> 02:06:12.633]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:12.653 --> 02:06:16.315]  Brenda, Johanna, and others, you'll be up first.
[02:06:17.156 --> 02:06:18.537]  Before we go back to our guest...
[02:06:19.341 --> 02:06:33.984]  Michael Markavage, who's facing 47 years in jail, or standing on the street corner reading Bible scriptures, and 15 months in jail and a huge $2,000-plus fine for trying to read out of the Bible during his citizens' communications, which I guess in his town they gave him 10 minutes.
[02:06:34.164 --> 02:06:35.224]  Here in Austin, you get three.
[02:06:35.744 --> 02:06:39.325]  Two minutes into it, or less than two minutes into it, they seize him and arrest him.
[02:06:40.645 --> 02:06:42.466]  We played the clip last hour just calmly.
[02:06:42.506 --> 02:06:44.366]  Yes, sir, I'd like to now read from the Bible.
[02:06:44.386 --> 02:06:45.046]  Well, you can't do that.
[02:06:45.086 --> 02:06:46.287]  Well, please, sir, I'd like to.
[02:06:46.307 --> 02:06:47.587]  You know, for two minutes this goes on.
[02:06:49.033 --> 02:06:50.053]  This is the new America.
[02:06:50.114 --> 02:06:51.254]  But I want you to understand something.
[02:06:51.274 --> 02:06:56.776]  During Bush's coronation, this is all getting worse under Bush because I know conservatives are asleep.
[02:06:57.337 --> 02:07:04.680]  During Bush's coronation, they did not allow Christians to have crosses anywhere in these 40 blocks.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.381]  No anti-war signs.
[02:07:07.401 --> 02:07:10.162]  People still violated it because the First Amendment is still there.
[02:07:10.743 --> 02:07:13.924]  But the point is they take something from the conservatives, take something from the liberals.
[02:07:14.651 --> 02:07:18.954]  They go and take somebody's right to protest on the street corner against Bush without a permit.
[02:07:19.274 --> 02:07:23.176]  They take a conservative's right to stand, you know, even 100 feet away from an abortion clinic.
[02:07:23.196 --> 02:07:26.398]  They come over and beat you on the head with a billy club or nunchucks.
[02:07:26.438 --> 02:07:28.519]  I've got video of this, breaking women and men's arms.
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:29.960]  The crowd's laughing at them.
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.301]  The cop's doing it in front of cameras.
[02:07:31.941 --> 02:07:33.482]  They think this is acceptable.
[02:07:34.043 --> 02:07:36.444]  And frankly, they abuse Christians more than anybody else.
[02:07:36.504 --> 02:07:40.867]  But now the left, who loved this in the last 15 years, it's happening to them.
[02:07:41.952 --> 02:07:47.913]  And so the globalists are masters of picking one group and doing it to them and publicizing it and then knowing that other groups support it.
[02:07:48.273 --> 02:07:52.794]  Folks, we all hang together or we all hang separate, as the Founding Fathers said.
[02:07:53.434 --> 02:07:55.615]  And man, it is getting bad in this country.
[02:07:56.735 --> 02:08:05.137]  You know, where somebody with an anti-Bush sign on a street corner gets two months in prison or jail, a Christian gets years in jail.
[02:08:05.617 --> 02:08:06.717]  But it's for everybody.
[02:08:07.757 --> 02:08:09.299]  And it's really bad.
[02:08:09.359 --> 02:08:28.856]  I want to go to Brenda and Johanna and others, but going back to Pastor Ted Pike, a real expert, I've heard him on air before, I believe we had him on as a guest, he called into the show, we're honored to have him, riding shotgun with a thought criminal, hate criminal, Michael Markavage, who's facing 47 years, the director of repentamerica.com.
[02:08:30.405 --> 02:08:34.729]  I don't think people realize how widespread this is getting, and they're teaching the cops this.
[02:08:34.769 --> 02:08:42.135]  I mean, four or five years ago, I'd have them walk up to me at a Second Amendment counter-protest against the 100 bureaucrats, known as the Million Moms.
[02:08:42.415 --> 02:08:53.284]  They'd be hitting us, spraying water on our cameras, cussing at us, and the cops would say, you being here on a city street is causing them to become angry, so we're going to have to arrest you.
[02:08:54.895 --> 02:08:57.096]  And so they've been telling them this for a long time.
[02:08:57.136 --> 02:08:59.217]  I guess next time I'll get 47 years in prison.
[02:08:59.237 --> 02:09:01.017]  Well, I'm not going to let that chill me.
[02:09:01.637 --> 02:09:06.079]  And we sued the state police here, the Capitol Police and the Austin Police.
[02:09:06.119 --> 02:09:07.540]  They've all lost lawsuits over this.
[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:14.342]  So the courts here have said, yes, you can't arrest somebody for being on the street corner with a sign when another demonstration is going on.
[02:09:15.397 --> 02:09:16.838]  But in other areas they're doing this.
[02:09:16.878 --> 02:09:19.739]  We're getting bad rulings from federal courts saying, yes, they can.
[02:09:20.279 --> 02:09:21.139]  Very scary.
[02:09:21.179 --> 02:09:32.423]  I don't think people realize that the host of One Man and His Dog, one of the most popular rural affairs shows in England on BBC, gave a speech two years ago at a rural affairs meeting.
[02:09:32.443 --> 02:09:37.865]  And all he said was, rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[02:09:39.105 --> 02:09:40.806]  I had him on, Robin Page.
[02:09:41.206 --> 02:09:43.067]  He wasn't even against the gays.
[02:09:43.678 --> 02:09:44.419]  The homosexuals.
[02:09:44.459 --> 02:09:47.381]  He was literally just used the word homosexual.
[02:09:47.741 --> 02:09:49.803]  That now selectively is illegal.
[02:09:49.863 --> 02:09:56.569]  We have the London Telegraph articles along with the audio file and the old prisonplanet.com audio archive.
[02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:58.450]  We ought to air that sometime, that page interview.
[02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:59.611]  We're going to have the page back on.
[02:10:00.372 --> 02:10:11.441]  And because he said that, the head of Scotland Yard Diversity Unit and Hate Crimes Unit, she was quoted as saying, the word homosexual is hateful and causes pain.
[02:10:12.196 --> 02:10:17.820]  So we came and we arrested him, and then he promised never to say it again, so we dropped the charges.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:26.745]  But then there was another BBC article last year, and it said 100 hate crimes individuals raided.
[02:10:27.186 --> 02:10:28.166]  The headline was something like that.
[02:10:28.186 --> 02:10:30.708]  100 homes raided in hate crimes sweep.
[02:10:30.968 --> 02:10:31.668]  That was the headline.
[02:10:31.688 --> 02:10:33.149]  I've got a pretty good memory, don't I, folks?
[02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:35.010]  I think that's it, word for word.
[02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:36.331]  100 homes raided in hate crimes sweep.
[02:10:36.351 --> 02:10:36.431]  Yes.
[02:10:36.451 --> 02:10:37.172]  In London alone.
[02:10:41.272 --> 02:10:41.933]  And it was in there.
[02:10:41.953 --> 02:10:43.334]  Whole families being grabbed.
[02:10:43.394 --> 02:10:44.135]  Paddy wagons.
[02:10:44.435 --> 02:10:46.257]  Men in black masks with machine guns.
[02:10:46.277 --> 02:10:49.621]  And they were pastors and preachers and talk show hosts.
[02:10:49.681 --> 02:10:51.723]  And people are being arrested or fined.
[02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:55.908]  Writers who criticize the EU and Germany and France.
[02:10:56.748 --> 02:11:04.512]  They passed laws where you, what is it, 10 years in prison, and the equivalent of a $700,000 fine in France if you criticize homosexuality.
[02:11:04.532 --> 02:11:05.733]  That passed late last year.
[02:11:06.693 --> 02:11:11.336]  Pastor Ted Pike, this is ultra-massive what's happening.
[02:11:11.914 --> 02:11:26.566]  Well, if you really want to know the truth about it, this all began around 1988 when the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith held a huge so-called model anti-hate competition to all law students in the United States.
[02:11:27.066 --> 02:11:35.994]  A winner was selected and the ADL at its Hofstra Conference in 1988 contrived a model anti-hate law for America
[02:11:36.514 --> 02:11:44.280]  During the 1990s, the ADL persuaded no less than 48 of the states to adopt its so-called anti-intimidation law.
[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:58.312]  And I would add, it's the ADL that helped fund the move against Supreme Court Justice of Alabama, Roy Moore, and it was Bush's man who they promoted to a federal judgeship who went after Moore.
[02:11:58.432 --> 02:11:59.933]  Again, it's systematic.
[02:11:59.973 --> 02:12:00.414]  Go ahead.
[02:12:00.654 --> 02:12:01.214]  That's right.
[02:12:01.334 --> 02:12:03.116]  And the ADL was given power...
[02:12:03.516 --> 02:12:19.439]  Under the Hate Crimes Statistic Act of 1990, which is also their baby, to have a federal mandate that they teach police departments in the United States, FBI, Justice Department officials, their twisted definition of what hate is.
[02:12:19.799 --> 02:12:27.061]  And hate is myself saying gun control is wrong and I'm allowed to be struck in front of police
[02:12:27.777 --> 02:12:30.399]  And then I'm threatened with arrest as I'm being hit in the head with science.
[02:12:30.519 --> 02:12:30.979]  That's right.
[02:12:31.039 --> 02:12:38.464]  And the ADL teaches sensitivity training seminars for all police officers in the United States, creating their own anti-hick of stuff.
[02:12:38.504 --> 02:12:43.588]  Now, this is similar to the Nazis against the Jews, how for seven, eight years, folks, they weren't arresting them.
[02:12:43.808 --> 02:12:48.011]  They were just intimidating their businesses, not letting them protest, not letting them go vote.
[02:12:48.651 --> 02:12:52.234]  And then it got worse and worse, then arresting them, quote, for what they'd been doing.
[02:12:52.454 --> 02:12:53.915]  It's very similar to the Nazis.
[02:12:54.335 --> 02:13:01.403]  Well, in Philadelphia right now, we see Lynn Abraham, who is the district attorney for the city of Philadelphia.
[02:13:01.804 --> 02:13:07.430]  She is also a board member, a national board member of the executive board of the ADL.
[02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:08.331]  Setting precedent.
[02:13:09.012 --> 02:13:13.797]  Clearly, this directive to attack these Christians came straight down from the ADL.
[02:13:13.817 --> 02:13:14.458]  It wasn't a...
[02:13:14.978 --> 02:13:20.721]  And so that's what the Christians get for predominantly supporting the ADL and their operations.
[02:13:20.741 --> 02:13:21.341]  Well, that's right.
[02:13:21.401 --> 02:13:30.306]  And you see, these Christians on the street corner were viewed by the police who are all revved up by the ADL as haters because they are clearly biased against homosexuals.
[02:13:31.329 --> 02:13:41.573]  And what happens there, according to these hate crimes laws of the ADL, is if you have bias and then you have some kind of violation of law, you are a hate criminal.
[02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:52.317]  And now, I want to go to calls, but now Michael Chertoff has gotten all these ADL awards, he's actually, it's basically unknown that he's a guy who's been going after Christians for a long time.
[02:13:52.717 --> 02:13:53.157]  Oh, yes.
[02:13:53.317 --> 02:13:58.840]  And as head of Homeland Security, we can expect that the ADL will be working very closely.
[02:13:58.900 --> 02:14:01.161]  And you'll never hear it on the 700 Club.
[02:14:01.221 --> 02:14:06.363]  You'll never hear it on even shows I like, like Marlon Maddox's.
[02:14:06.684 --> 02:14:09.285]  They just will not talk about it.
[02:14:09.685 --> 02:14:10.625]  And this is deadly.
[02:14:10.965 --> 02:14:12.046]  Let's take some calls.
[02:14:12.066 --> 02:14:16.028]  Well, first off, any quick comments before I go to Brenda and Johanna and others?
[02:14:16.568 --> 02:14:18.369]  Michael Markavage, Thought Criminal.
[02:14:18.954 --> 02:14:28.400]  Well, yes, there were some anti-life people in Redding, I believe it was Redding, California, who, a couple months after our Outfest arrest, who were charged.
[02:14:28.965 --> 02:14:35.848]  Because they vandalized about 3,000 crosses, they were pro-abortion, and they were charged with a hate crime.
[02:14:35.928 --> 02:14:48.974]  So just that goes in sync with what you were talking about earlier and how it does victimize not only Christians, but anyone who, I mean, obviously these people, if they did commit vandalism... Yeah, they do it to Christians first to set the precedent, then they do it to everybody.
[02:14:48.994 --> 02:14:50.735]  They want to control everybody's speech.
[02:14:51.295 --> 02:14:52.576]  Brenda, where are you calling us from?
[02:14:54.542 --> 02:14:55.323]  Brenda, you're on the air.
[02:14:55.343 --> 02:14:55.783]  Go ahead.
[02:14:56.184 --> 02:15:00.027]  Yes, thank you, Alex, for having these courageous men on your show.
[02:15:01.208 --> 02:15:18.304]  I caught the show a little bit late, but I also wanted to say, to second the emotion, that the ADL, the Mossad, the B'nai B'rith, they're usually, when you go behind the scenes, you see that these are the people that are behind our most frightening anti-Christian laws and regulations.
[02:15:18.857 --> 02:15:21.038]  And I appreciate that it's being said here today.
[02:15:21.078 --> 02:15:21.899]  God bless you all.
[02:15:21.939 --> 02:15:22.379]  Thank you.
[02:15:22.419 --> 02:15:22.899]  Bye-bye.
[02:15:23.279 --> 02:15:27.001]  Well, it's a lot of groups, but they're definitely involved because they don't want free speech in this country.
[02:15:27.461 --> 02:15:28.862]  A bunch of these groups don't want it.
[02:15:29.602 --> 02:15:31.463]  Let's talk to Johanna in Texas.
[02:15:31.483 --> 02:15:31.783]  Go ahead.
[02:15:31.803 --> 02:15:32.344]  You're on the air.
[02:15:33.864 --> 02:15:34.525]  Let me speak.
[02:15:35.365 --> 02:15:43.649]  The first thing I do want to say is I'm going to pray for Michael and the people that have been arrested along with him.
[02:15:44.809 --> 02:15:45.810]  That may be a thought crime.
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.060]  It's just too bad.
[02:15:49.041 --> 02:15:51.361]  This is also written in Matthew 24.
[02:15:51.421 --> 02:15:52.582]  People need to get out the Bibles.
[02:15:53.002 --> 02:15:55.522]  Matthew 24 is very serious, very real.
[02:15:55.542 --> 02:16:08.406]  I wanted to say if people seriously first repent their sins, just like Michael's web is Repent America, well that is the first thing that we have to do in order for the Creator to start listening to our prayers.
[02:16:09.110 --> 02:16:18.533]  People are praying, but they're not serious enough about praying what we must be praying about and establishing our close relationship with the Creator so He'll even hear our prayers and respond.
[02:16:18.573 --> 02:16:23.975]  And that's why people don't take us seriously, because we don't have the relationship we claim to have.
[02:16:24.115 --> 02:16:28.797]  Well, also, most Christians are neutralized, sucking their thumbs, thinking George Bush is Jesus.
[02:16:29.457 --> 02:16:34.239]  Literally, some of them think this, not knowing that, I mean, actually, he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.720]  Comments to that, Michael?
[02:16:37.409 --> 02:16:54.866]  Well, that's partially why we put out the website BushReveal.com earlier on when we wanted to educate the Christian people, to exhort them to really look at the fruit of George Bush and how dangerous this is, especially with some of these new developments with the Homeland Security and so on.
[02:16:55.956 --> 02:16:57.017]  It's unbelievable.
[02:16:57.057 --> 02:16:57.959]  I mean, look, it's admitted.
[02:16:57.979 --> 02:17:02.324]  He's a member of the most powerful satanic society on Earth, the Order of Death.
[02:17:02.804 --> 02:17:04.226]  He goes to Bohemian Grove.
[02:17:04.747 --> 02:17:09.412]  And I got the New York Post headline, Top Gay Porn Star Services Moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[02:17:09.693 --> 02:17:11.335]  I mean, they just bust them in, folks.
[02:17:11.355 --> 02:17:13.437]  This is our Christian leaders.
[02:17:13.758 --> 02:17:14.559]  Comments, Ted Pike?
[02:17:16.408 --> 02:17:22.032]  Yes, we have the beginnings here of real persecution against Christians.
[02:17:22.832 --> 02:17:29.937]  For generations, Christians have feared that persecution would come, but we're having it busting out here in Philadelphia.
[02:17:30.337 --> 02:17:39.083]  And if it hadn't been for Michael's courage and others of us sounding the alarm, there'd still be a blackout of any news in Philadelphia.
[02:17:39.123 --> 02:17:41.065]  Well, we're not going quietly into the night.
[02:17:41.105 --> 02:17:41.765]  Stay there, Pastor.
[02:17:41.785 --> 02:17:42.886]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[02:17:44.645 --> 02:17:46.107]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[02:17:46.427 --> 02:17:51.012]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:51.352 --> 02:17:53.695]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:53.915 --> 02:17:55.457]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:55.817 --> 02:18:00.902]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:01.223 --> 02:18:02.444]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:18:02.504 --> 02:18:05.207]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:18:05.587 --> 02:18:11.530]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[02:18:16.453 --> 02:18:16.813]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:16.833 --> 02:18:24.618]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:25.138 --> 02:18:30.643]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:30.723 --> 02:18:32.704]  Get the map.
[02:18:32.724 --> 02:18:35.126]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[02:18:35.346 --> 02:18:36.307]  The time is now.
[02:18:36.687 --> 02:18:37.648]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:39.569 --> 02:18:42.692]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:18:43.877 --> 02:18:46.339]  I've lost 26 pounds so far with Vim and Vigor.
[02:18:46.619 --> 02:18:49.681]  Since I've been with Vim and Vigor, I've lost 30 pounds.
[02:18:49.981 --> 02:18:52.643]  Went from a size 42 to a size 38.
[02:18:52.823 --> 02:18:56.806]  People are flabbergasted when they see me and they can't believe it because they've always seen me heavy.
[02:18:57.106 --> 02:18:59.808]  My waist has shrunk at least two or three loops on a belt.
[02:19:00.128 --> 02:19:02.990]  And most of my sweatpants and other pants have just been hanging down.
[02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:05.171]  And I've tried a lot for a lot of years.
[02:19:05.271 --> 02:19:10.795]  But I have not, and I can honestly say I have not seen weight loss like I have with Vim and Vigor.
[02:19:11.275 --> 02:19:13.537]  I would highly recommend using Vim and Vigor.
[02:19:13.797 --> 02:19:20.322]  Not only has it helped me lose weight, it has helped my blood pressure, helped me sleep better, and have more energy during the day.
[02:19:20.622 --> 02:19:24.986]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:19:25.306 --> 02:19:26.667]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:19:26.687 --> 02:19:27.347]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:19:27.387 --> 02:19:29.409]  And remember, mention you heard it right here.
[02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:31.631]  That gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:19:37.455 --> 02:19:40.237]  Vim and Vigor calling today, 1-800-622-THEN.
[02:19:40.357 --> 02:19:40.977]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:19:41.157 --> 02:19:45.240]  Hello, folks.

[02:20:37.197 --> 02:20:38.297]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:38.758 --> 02:20:42.280]  Or order online at murkywater.com.
[02:20:44.581 --> 02:20:47.063]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:47.823 --> 02:20:50.465]  Patrick Henry said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[02:20:51.205 --> 02:21:02.112]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech?
[02:21:02.776 --> 02:21:03.336]  We're good to go.
[02:21:23.271 --> 02:21:23.791]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:23.811 --> 02:21:24.131]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:24.171 --> 02:21:25.552]  The call is free.
[02:21:25.572 --> 02:21:31.375]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year's subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:59.816 --> 02:22:13.359]  For those that just joined us, Michael Markavage of Repent America, we played the audio of the video, standing there peaceably, was told to leave the city, Philadelphia, told to leave that area, just standing on the street corner, they were arrested, charged with felonies.
[02:22:14.059 --> 02:22:18.180]  And the prosecutors and people, you know, they have to admit they did nothing wrong, but still you're going to go to jail for 47 years.
[02:22:19.787 --> 02:22:20.527]  It's unbelievable.
[02:22:20.568 --> 02:22:29.152]  And before Pastor Ted Pikes leaves us, we'll give you the toll-free number to call Congress and tell them don't pass federal hate crimes, thought crime legislation.
[02:22:30.233 --> 02:22:32.715]  Right now, let's take a few calls.
[02:22:32.755 --> 02:22:34.215]  Let's talk to L.D.
[02:22:34.796 --> 02:22:36.016]  in Alaska.
[02:22:36.076 --> 02:22:37.557]  Let's go north to Alaska.
[02:22:38.018 --> 02:22:38.838]  L.D., go ahead.
[02:22:39.599 --> 02:22:40.099]  How you doing?
[02:22:40.419 --> 02:22:40.979]  Good.
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:47.203]  I first heard you on Outfails Coast to Coast, and since then I've bought eight of your videos.
[02:22:47.876 --> 02:22:49.337]  And my question to you is this.
[02:22:49.777 --> 02:22:54.241]  Do you have any information on the tunnel systems that the U.S.
[02:22:54.281 --> 02:22:58.724]  government and private corporations have been digging underneath the United States in that?
[02:22:58.924 --> 02:23:00.165]  Have you got anything like that?
[02:23:00.185 --> 02:23:02.026]  Well, I mean, there's a lot of stuff that's declassified.
[02:23:02.086 --> 02:23:07.070]  Since the 40s, they built giant tunnel systems connecting Washington to the Southwest.
[02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:09.811]  I mean, there's all sorts of underground railways.
[02:23:09.851 --> 02:23:13.194]  Most of it's classified, but they admit they spent billions on the systems.
[02:23:13.234 --> 02:23:14.735]  I mean, they've got giant...
[02:23:15.854 --> 02:23:20.078]  Do you have any information on your website or anything where I can get on it?
[02:23:20.418 --> 02:23:22.199]  Yeah, I mean, it's on the web, sir.
[02:23:22.239 --> 02:23:24.501]  I mean, a lot of it's disinfo, but there's whole books written.
[02:23:24.521 --> 02:23:25.562]  I mean, a lot of it's declassified.
[02:23:25.582 --> 02:23:27.624]  They've had History Channel specials about it.
[02:23:28.645 --> 02:23:30.506]  Do you have any comments about the First Amendment, though?
[02:23:30.526 --> 02:23:31.667]  Do you have any comments for our guest?
[02:23:32.788 --> 02:23:33.869]  Oh, on the First Amendment?
[02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.710]  Yes.
[02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:40.395]  No, I'm in court right now on the Sixth Amendment of the Assistance of Counsel.
[02:23:41.377 --> 02:23:45.079]  And the court will not allow me to have assistance of counsel.
[02:23:45.239 --> 02:23:49.780]  They insist that I have representation from counsel where they speak for me.
[02:23:49.941 --> 02:23:54.883]  Yeah, I mean, it's a huge problem, and I want to thank you for your support, LD, and God bless.
[02:23:54.903 --> 02:23:56.683]  I'll try to do a show on that sometime.
[02:23:56.923 --> 02:23:58.984]  David in California, do you have any comments for our guest?
[02:24:00.845 --> 02:24:03.446]  Yeah, I just support him 100%.
[02:24:03.506 --> 02:24:06.687]  I'm going to call that number that you gave out earlier.
[02:24:06.707 --> 02:24:10.389]  So there's new legislation that you were speaking of earlier.
[02:24:11.996 --> 02:24:12.737]  Remind me of that.
[02:24:12.857 --> 02:24:13.878]  I just drew a blank.
[02:24:13.958 --> 02:24:19.743]  Yeah, in fact, give us that phone number again and the bill number, Pastor Pike, for the thought crime legislation.
[02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:22.006]  Yes, the toll-free number is 877-762-8762.
[02:24:22.246 --> 02:24:22.726]  That's 877-762-8762.
[02:24:22.806 --> 02:24:24.108]  And that's the...
[02:24:36.838 --> 02:24:39.682]  Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005, H.R.
[02:24:39.702 --> 02:24:39.682]  259.
[02:24:39.742 --> 02:24:42.707]  That's the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005.
[02:24:48.141 --> 02:24:48.621]  HR 259.
[02:24:49.202 --> 02:25:01.528]  I should also mention that if our listeners can go to the government website, they will find 22 members, that's Republican members, of the Committee on the Judiciary.
[02:25:01.608 --> 02:25:02.609]  It's easy to find.
[02:25:02.629 --> 02:25:11.734]  Call those 22 members and let them know that we will not stand for our free speech rights being taken away by a big federal hate bill.
[02:25:12.799 --> 02:25:13.119]  All right.
[02:25:13.159 --> 02:25:14.359]  Anything else, David?
[02:25:14.559 --> 02:25:17.560]  No, I just... He has my support, and I'm going to call that number.
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:19.540]  Well, it's all of us in it together.
[02:25:20.081 --> 02:25:21.781]  I mean, we're all losing our freedoms here.
[02:25:21.861 --> 02:25:25.802]  Ron in New York, you're on the air with Michael Markavage and Pastor Ted Pike.
[02:25:25.822 --> 02:25:26.142]  Go ahead.
[02:25:26.682 --> 02:25:27.742]  It's not about this topic.
[02:25:27.822 --> 02:25:33.463]  It's about the State of the Union and the comments that Jay Sekulow made on Mike Cheritoff.
[02:25:33.483 --> 02:25:35.444]  I don't know if you want to hear that in Gonzales.
[02:25:35.544 --> 02:25:38.024]  Well, just what a wonderful, lordly man they all are.
[02:25:38.044 --> 02:25:41.885]  Well, he said, Mike Cheritoff is a friend of mine.
[02:25:42.461 --> 02:25:54.769]  With Deputy AG of the United States will make an excellent Homeland Security Chief, and he's going to... And what does he say about Alberto Olive Abortion Gonzalez?
[02:25:54.789 --> 02:25:55.949]  Let me find this.
[02:25:56.329 --> 02:25:58.511]  I have it on tape if you want to hear it.
[02:25:58.551 --> 02:26:00.292]  I don't want to play his show on the show.
[02:26:00.772 --> 02:26:04.815]  He said... I've got it on here.
[02:26:04.835 --> 02:26:06.135]  You don't remember what he said?
[02:26:06.516 --> 02:26:07.916]  I've got it written down, Alex.
[02:26:07.956 --> 02:26:09.417]  I can't remember all that.
[02:26:09.437 --> 02:26:10.758]  There's a lot of stuff there.
[02:26:10.778 --> 02:26:12.019]  All right.
[02:26:13.038 --> 02:26:15.680]  I don't know, he's saying the praises of Gonzalez.
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:18.001]  He said, you know, a lot of that isn't so.
[02:26:18.121 --> 02:26:22.004]  All he did was verify what's already on the books.
[02:26:22.344 --> 02:26:23.825]  He didn't authorize torture.
[02:26:23.845 --> 02:26:25.866]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:26:26.047 --> 02:26:29.269]  He argued that 12-year-olds shouldn't be able to tell their parents when they have abortions.
[02:26:29.569 --> 02:26:34.712]  He's for gun control, but I'll tell you, Sekulow is a total mole.
[02:26:34.952 --> 02:26:35.473]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:35.493 --> 02:26:37.154]  Let me get a comment from Pastor Ted Pike on that.
[02:26:41.765 --> 02:26:46.288]  I guess I'm not too much versed on the Gonzalez thing.
[02:26:46.428 --> 02:26:47.609]  What about you, Michael?
[02:26:47.809 --> 02:26:52.251]  Yeah, I heard about the praise that came from Jay Sekulow for Albert Gonzalez.
[02:26:52.331 --> 02:26:53.652]  I was disheartened by that.
[02:26:54.413 --> 02:26:59.556]  And certainly we're seeing more of this where they're just disregarding what these men have done.
[02:27:00.096 --> 02:27:10.542]  And certainly we know that Alberto Gonzalez in that situation where I think it was a 12-year-old, as you said, that they could have abortions without informing their parents, well,
[02:27:11.084 --> 02:27:11.625]  In Texas.
[02:27:12.385 --> 02:27:13.746]  And it's just disheartening.
[02:27:13.947 --> 02:27:14.407]  It really is.
[02:27:14.767 --> 02:27:16.789]  Well, you're a liberal if you're against abortion.
[02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:18.070]  Right.
[02:27:18.871 --> 02:27:20.492]  I mean, you've really got to learn this, man.
[02:27:20.512 --> 02:27:21.253]  You've got to learn.
[02:27:22.053 --> 02:27:24.836]  Let's come back, take a few more calls, and wrap it up with you gentlemen.
[02:27:24.856 --> 02:27:26.657]  I'm going to cover a whole bunch of other news.
[02:27:26.697 --> 02:27:27.678]  Believe me, you don't want to miss it.
[02:27:28.559 --> 02:27:29.740]  There's just masses of it.
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:31.541]  Some new 9-11 cover-ups going on.
[02:27:31.562 --> 02:27:31.982]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.566 --> 02:27:35.447]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.948 --> 02:27:37.569]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.490 --> 02:27:41.153]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.409 --> 02:27:47.790]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.351]  Why?
[02:27:48.371 --> 02:27:51.332]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:27:51.412 --> 02:27:56.353]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:27:56.474 --> 02:28:06.197]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[02:28:44.176 --> 02:28:50.423]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:50.563 --> 02:28:56.729]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:57.009 --> 02:29:05.398]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.678 --> 02:29:12.724]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:13.005 --> 02:29:17.849]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:26.857]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[02:29:35.964 --> 02:29:39.066]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[02:29:39.086 --> 02:29:40.567]  In business and socially.
[02:29:50.672 --> 02:29:57.054]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:29:57.654 --> 02:29:59.374]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[02:30:00.095 --> 02:30:06.076]  While you listen, verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:30:06.696 --> 02:30:08.257]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:30:08.797 --> 02:30:10.978]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:30:11.538 --> 02:30:13.558]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:30:14.139 --> 02:30:15.239]  And it's so easy.
[02:30:15.939 --> 02:30:17.960]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:19.340]  When you want.
[02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:20.565]  Where you want.

[02:30:30.111 --> 02:30:31.512]  1-800-419-WORD That's 419-WORD 1-800-419-WORD
[02:30:48.425 --> 02:30:54.247]  They railed against the crown.
[02:30:55.147 --> 02:30:58.108]  Another ragtag ban.
[02:30:58.388 --> 02:30:58.988]  Declaring.
[02:31:01.649 --> 02:31:07.051]  Independence.
[02:31:07.111 --> 02:31:12.673]  What is America if we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution that simply enumerate and point out our God-given rights?
[02:31:14.913 --> 02:31:16.694]  You know, my friends, I think we lose...
[02:31:18.291 --> 02:31:20.492]  connection with just how serious all of this is.
[02:31:20.813 --> 02:31:22.313]  None of us want a national ID card.
[02:31:22.333 --> 02:31:22.894]  They pass it.
[02:31:24.295 --> 02:31:26.956]  The Constitution and the American people don't want open borders.
[02:31:27.016 --> 02:31:27.717]  They just do it.
[02:31:29.137 --> 02:31:31.098]  They're butchering the Bill of Rights at every level.
[02:31:31.339 --> 02:31:32.879]  The average person isn't even aware of it.
[02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:36.802]  And then I think of stories from the unbelievable to the ridiculous.
[02:31:36.842 --> 02:31:39.323]  David Icke, a few years ago, who I don't agree with.
[02:31:40.324 --> 02:31:43.305]  David Icke believes blood-drinking aliens control the government.
[02:31:43.846 --> 02:31:45.006]  That's pretty ridiculous stuff.
[02:31:46.087 --> 02:31:47.548]  But it's his right to say it.
[02:31:48.707 --> 02:31:52.768]  And when he tried to go into Canada to speak, they talked about having him thrown out or arrested.
[02:31:52.788 --> 02:31:53.948]  They actually did detain him.
[02:31:54.688 --> 02:31:58.789]  They said, we think your lizard talk is code words for racial groups.
[02:31:58.929 --> 02:31:59.129]  No.
[02:31:59.629 --> 02:32:01.569]  David Icke really believes they're reptoids.
[02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:08.671]  The point is, people that are, well, some would say off their rockers.
[02:32:09.631 --> 02:32:11.011]  Just don't talk bad about the lizards.
[02:32:11.231 --> 02:32:14.052]  Now, I mean, you can get that out of the Toronto Star.
[02:32:14.132 --> 02:32:16.652]  Seriously talking about what does he mean by lizard, you know.
[02:32:18.522 --> 02:32:25.245]  So, it's from the New Age to conservative Christians, from peace activists to anti-abortion protesters.
[02:32:26.785 --> 02:32:28.186]  It's unbelievable.
[02:32:28.206 --> 02:32:40.151]  And we'll take a few final calls from William and Cliff and a few others for our guests, but first I wanted to let Michael Markavage make any final comments before we go to these final calls, and then let Pastor Ted Pike make any other observations.
[02:32:40.391 --> 02:32:40.631]  Michael?
[02:32:41.306 --> 02:32:45.688]  I would just like to say that we appreciate the prayers of so many across the nation and the world.
[02:32:46.068 --> 02:32:54.791]  I've been receiving calls as far as Taiwan and England of people who are concerned about what's happening to us in Philadelphia, especially in the birthplace of American freedom.
[02:32:55.271 --> 02:33:01.493]  And as we see our civil liberties being eroded by these tyrannical people, we must raise our voice.
[02:33:01.593 --> 02:33:04.814]  And our hope is that people would continue to raise their voice against the
[02:33:07.494 --> 02:33:12.898]  And folks can go to repentamerica.com and watch the seven-minute clip where they arrest you for absolutely no reason.
[02:33:13.198 --> 02:33:18.841]  Watch the clip where you calmly talk to the city council and say, I'd like to read a passage from the Bible during my time.
[02:33:18.881 --> 02:33:19.922]  And they said, no, you're arrested.
[02:33:20.742 --> 02:33:25.085]  And then the guy that was in the newspaper, the mayor had you arrested, going, he deserves it.
[02:33:25.405 --> 02:33:26.346]  This guy's a hater.
[02:33:26.986 --> 02:33:28.547]  I mean, these people are folks.
[02:33:28.587 --> 02:33:30.028]  They don't know what country they're living in.
[02:33:30.708 --> 02:33:32.409]  And it's very, very serious.
[02:33:32.609 --> 02:33:33.350]  Pastor Ted Pike,
[02:33:34.099 --> 02:33:34.359]  Yes.
[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:38.442]  I have an outstanding video, an 80-minute video.
[02:33:38.502 --> 02:33:43.926]  Thousands have been sold, and it's held back this federal hate bill three times.
[02:33:44.286 --> 02:33:47.248]  It's called, Hate Laws Making Criminals of Christians.
[02:33:47.328 --> 02:33:47.429]  It's $25.
[02:33:47.709 --> 02:33:55.955]  You can order that online at our website, which is www.truthtellers.org.
[02:33:56.035 --> 02:33:58.256]  That's www.truthtellers.org.
[02:33:58.416 --> 02:33:59.857]  Or if you'd like to call me at 503-631-7000.
[02:34:04.762 --> 02:34:05.182]  503-631-3808.
[02:34:06.563 --> 02:34:09.704]  That's 503-631-3808.
[02:34:09.964 --> 02:34:14.526]  Pastor Pike, will you mail me a copy of that today so I can put it on my TV show?
[02:34:14.726 --> 02:34:15.886]  You bet I will.
[02:34:16.206 --> 02:34:17.647]  You see, we've got to get educated.
[02:34:17.687 --> 02:34:20.368]  This film should be shown at every church in America.
[02:34:20.408 --> 02:34:21.008]  I've heard about it.
[02:34:21.068 --> 02:34:22.589]  Let me give you my address.
[02:34:22.609 --> 02:34:23.609]  Can I give that to you right now?
[02:34:23.629 --> 02:34:24.129]  Yes, you can.
[02:34:25.129 --> 02:34:26.750]  It's Alex Jones at 3001-3001.
[02:34:32.212 --> 02:34:37.735]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:40.717 --> 02:34:43.239]  And will you please send me a copy of that tape, sir?
[02:34:43.519 --> 02:34:44.279]  You bet I will.
[02:34:44.339 --> 02:34:44.980]  Thank you very much.
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:45.720]  You bet.
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:46.560]  Do you have that address?
[02:34:46.981 --> 02:34:47.621]  That was 78074.
[02:34:47.741 --> 02:34:50.443]  It's 3001-3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:02.002]  Okay, I got that.
[02:35:03.203 --> 02:35:04.984]  787... And I'll put it on my local cable show.
[02:35:05.004 --> 02:35:08.087]  It's pretty popular, and I'll put your website out there as well.
[02:35:08.487 --> 02:35:09.188]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:09.328 --> 02:35:09.948]  Oh, you bet.
[02:35:10.369 --> 02:35:11.830]  Look, folks, it's serious business.
[02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:13.271]  Let's take two final calls.
[02:35:13.331 --> 02:35:14.892]  All I have time for, then I want to cover Nez.
[02:35:15.313 --> 02:35:16.974]  William in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:17.434]  Go ahead.
[02:35:18.035 --> 02:35:19.296]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:35:19.316 --> 02:35:21.398]  I really appreciate your work on your end of it there.
[02:35:21.958 --> 02:35:23.680]  I just wanted to bring some information to you.
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:24.881]  You may already have the...
[02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:31.936]  Yeah, that was originally owned, at least a couple months ago, by the Carlyle Group.
[02:35:48.817 --> 02:35:49.398]  Oh, I see.
[02:35:49.418 --> 02:35:53.922]  Well, I'm not familiar with the guy's name that originally produced it, but he spent several million on it.
[02:35:54.222 --> 02:35:56.844]  Well, fill people in on the specifics of what you're talking about.
[02:35:57.024 --> 02:36:07.233]  Okay, this was a software program designed to mass surveillance for individuals in that.
[02:36:07.253 --> 02:36:11.117]  Yeah, and one of the companies they used was run by a convicted drug cartel chief.
[02:36:11.157 --> 02:36:12.258]  That's exactly right.
[02:36:12.598 --> 02:36:15.260]  He supposedly spent the money...
[02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:25.452]  In order to produce this by some of that funding and that... Well, look, most of the people that you look that are running this are either convicted drug dealers or armed smugglers.
[02:36:25.492 --> 02:36:26.892]  I mean, it's the mafia, sir.
[02:36:27.272 --> 02:36:31.173]  Let me get a comment from our guest just about criminals taking over society.
[02:36:31.433 --> 02:36:32.853]  That's been the norm in history.
[02:36:33.153 --> 02:36:35.414]  People are naive about that, and now it's happening again.
[02:36:36.154 --> 02:36:39.015]  Mark, I mean, Michael or Pastor, any comments?
[02:36:41.775 --> 02:36:44.196]  Well, speaking of criminals, you know...
[02:36:46.112 --> 02:36:59.215]  Lynn Abraham is indicting these Christians in Philadelphia under the hate crimes laws of the state of Pennsylvania which combine bias motivation and some kind of violation of the law.
[02:36:59.496 --> 02:37:04.737]  The truth is, nobody is more biased than Lynn Abraham against these Christians
[02:37:05.337 --> 02:37:20.411]  Well, it's abuse of power, it's official oppression, it is racketeering, how they're working together to take somebody's rights.
[02:37:20.972 --> 02:37:28.779]  Actually, what I'm saying is she should be indicted for a hate crime under the anti-intimidation law of the state of Pennsylvania.
[02:37:29.255 --> 02:37:30.718]  No, but we all know that's not going to happen.
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:33.423]  Okay, anything else, William?
[02:37:33.623 --> 02:37:34.886]  I just wanted to say, I'm not...
[02:37:35.447 --> 02:37:41.312]  I'm not specific on the credibility of that show, Democracy Now!, but that's where it was highlighted on their show yesterday.
[02:37:41.352 --> 02:37:42.052]  No, Democracy Now!
[02:37:42.072 --> 02:37:42.853]  does a lot of good work.
[02:37:42.933 --> 02:37:44.154]  Okay, great.
[02:37:44.274 --> 02:37:47.097]  They just then give you false solutions that the U.N.
[02:37:47.117 --> 02:37:47.717]  is going to save us.
[02:37:47.977 --> 02:37:48.598]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:48.698 --> 02:37:48.978]  You bet.
[02:37:48.998 --> 02:37:49.518]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:49.579 --> 02:37:49.859]  You bet.
[02:37:49.939 --> 02:37:52.000]  Cliff in Virginia, last caller for our guest.
[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:52.721]  Go ahead, Cliff.
[02:37:53.161 --> 02:37:53.362]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:53.382 --> 02:37:54.182]  How are you doing?
[02:37:54.382 --> 02:37:54.583]  Good.
[02:37:55.183 --> 02:38:01.028]  I've got a quick comment here I'd like for all of you to respond to, if you will, and it pertains to our lost freedoms that we've been discussing.
[02:38:01.912 --> 02:38:10.719]  I just want to tell the other gentleman now, facing the 47 years, that I support your movement all the way, myself, and I've, you know, notified and alerted many others to do so, too.
[02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:12.861]  Excuse me?
[02:38:13.521 --> 02:38:15.663]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:38:15.703 --> 02:38:20.226]  I think that once we all get together on the First Amendment, that's when we're going to have success.
[02:38:21.067 --> 02:38:30.675]  Well, my comment, Alex, is I just happened to be up last night watching PBS with Think Tank with Ben Wattenberg, and they were doing a documentary on President Andrew Jackson with...
[02:38:31.846 --> 02:38:36.989]  Harry Watson from University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Robert Remney from Iowa.
[02:38:37.809 --> 02:38:43.492]  They were talking about how much freedom that the American people had back then as opposed to now.
[02:38:43.532 --> 02:38:50.135]  We had so much freedom back when Andrew Jackson was president that it was mostly an open White House.
[02:38:50.175 --> 02:38:54.818]  You could just walk in off the street and interrupt a meeting just to speak to the president.
[02:38:55.038 --> 02:38:59.220]  They were talking about how Andrew Jackson was the first and only president to pay off our national debt.
[02:38:59.795 --> 02:39:10.835]  And then they discussed a speech that he made where he plainly stated that if the people ever lost their democratic right and let the government control their democracy and their sovereignty, we would be further...
[02:39:11.488 --> 02:39:12.869]  And he was an amazing individual.
[02:39:38.291 --> 02:39:49.633]  And the comment that really struck my chord, I mean, if you listen to all this, and then just out of the blue, Ben Wattenberg says, well, I wonder what Mr. Jackson would think if he knew that the international bankers
[02:39:50.023 --> 02:39:55.464]  And the order of skull and bones was not only controlling the United States, but the entire world right now.
[02:39:55.644 --> 02:40:06.907]  And you're saying on PBS, and I didn't see this, but I believe you, everywhere, I'm having former top CIA analysts, you know, top analysts in the CIA on saying the government's going to carry out more terror attacks.
[02:40:06.967 --> 02:40:11.208]  I have, you know, admirals on talking about total new world order police state.
[02:40:11.248 --> 02:40:13.789]  I have the father of Reaganomics on, you know...
[02:40:15.890 --> 02:40:19.392]  In with the neocons saying it's a world conspiracy for New World Order.
[02:40:19.652 --> 02:40:21.153]  I mean, it's all out in the open.
[02:40:21.173 --> 02:40:22.394]  We're being given a choice.
[02:40:22.734 --> 02:40:25.995]  Oh, yeah, well, the choice we're being given is it's their way or no way.
[02:40:26.035 --> 02:40:26.876]  We don't have no choice.
[02:40:26.896 --> 02:40:28.837]  That's what they were saying about Andrew Jackson.
[02:40:28.857 --> 02:40:33.119]  They said his idea was democracy was to leave the sovereignty with the people for if...
[02:40:33.479 --> 02:40:38.102]  The people lost their sovereignty and gave control to the government, then we became automatic slaves.
[02:40:38.542 --> 02:40:39.463]  Yep, thanks for the call.
[02:40:39.503 --> 02:40:41.764]  Very good note to end with the callers.
[02:40:41.924 --> 02:40:43.025]  Gentlemen, final comments?
[02:40:43.946 --> 02:40:53.132]  Yes, on a brighter note, we must remember that this big hate bill has been defeated three times already in 2000, 2002, and in 2004, and we can defeat it again.
[02:40:57.134 --> 02:41:11.657]  It is true that members of both houses of Congress have indicated they will pass it, but if enough people lift a cry of protest right now, I believe we can back the ADL down one time more.
[02:41:11.697 --> 02:41:12.717]  And again, that number is 877-762-8762.
[02:41:12.737 --> 02:41:13.417]  Call them right now.
[02:41:13.457 --> 02:41:14.697]  And also, the bill number?
[02:41:14.717 --> 02:41:15.518]  The bill number is...
[02:41:24.255 --> 02:41:24.855]  HR 259.
[02:41:25.216 --> 02:41:28.677]  That's the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005.
[02:41:28.917 --> 02:41:29.298]  Okay.
[02:41:29.718 --> 02:41:31.559]  I want to thank you for joining us, Pastor Pike.
[02:41:31.579 --> 02:41:32.039]  Thank you.
[02:41:32.099 --> 02:41:36.121]  And Michael Markavich, facing 47 years with others.
[02:41:36.221 --> 02:41:37.382]  You can go watch the video.
[02:41:37.462 --> 02:41:37.942]  Did nothing.
[02:41:38.342 --> 02:41:39.683]  We played the audio last hour.
[02:41:39.963 --> 02:41:40.623]  Final comments.
[02:41:41.184 --> 02:41:45.406]  Well, thank you so much, Alex, for covering this story and making people aware of what's happening.
[02:41:45.426 --> 02:41:51.629]  The criminalization of Christianity is certain, and we must once again fight for our First Amendment rights.
[02:41:52.196 --> 02:41:58.142]  All right, God bless you, and we'll be following and chronicling your historic case as it develops.
[02:41:58.162 --> 02:41:59.083]  When's it going to trial?
[02:41:59.704 --> 02:42:11.697]  We have a trial on February 17th, which is a motion to dismiss based on the Constitution, and we're going to see whether or not the same judge who said she saw no criminal behavior in the video will dismiss this case.
[02:42:12.262 --> 02:42:17.903]  And you're still facing 15 months for Citizens Communication saying yes sir and no ma'am to the council.
[02:42:18.123 --> 02:42:18.463]  Correct.
[02:42:18.884 --> 02:42:19.304]  All right.
[02:42:19.464 --> 02:42:22.184]  And you can go watch all that on their website, RepentAmerica.com.
[02:42:22.664 --> 02:42:23.485]  God bless, gentlemen.
[02:42:23.505 --> 02:42:23.885]  Take care.
[02:42:24.005 --> 02:42:24.485]  God bless you.
[02:42:24.525 --> 02:42:24.885]  Thank you.
[02:42:25.445 --> 02:42:26.185]  All right, folks.
[02:42:26.225 --> 02:42:27.206]  So there's your new freedom.
[02:42:27.666 --> 02:42:29.846]  And it's across the board, the left, the right.
[02:42:29.866 --> 02:42:31.166]  Everybody's having this happen to them.
[02:42:31.967 --> 02:42:35.688]  And I hear the conservatives crowing on talk radio about the left losing their rights.
[02:42:35.708 --> 02:42:39.769]  And I hear the left crowing on their shows about conservatives losing their rights.
[02:42:39.809 --> 02:42:40.849]  And we're all losing our rights.
[02:42:40.869 --> 02:42:41.809]  We're a bunch of idiots.
[02:42:42.478 --> 02:42:48.360]  I mean, it's time to stand up for the First Amendment, regardless of which group it is that's being persecuted.
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:52.121]  Again, they passed the Super National ID card yesterday out of the House.
[02:42:52.902 --> 02:43:05.226]  That's going to the Senate, DNA testing when you get a driver's license, waiving things for illegal aliens, Pan American Union ID cards, targeting Christians and gun groups.
[02:43:05.246 --> 02:43:06.306]  I mean, it's all in there.
[02:43:07.006 --> 02:43:11.908]  We've got Ron Paul, Larry Pratt on analyzing the bill in the last three days with Ron Paul's office.
[02:43:12.962 --> 02:43:21.293]  So, it's just mind-blowing that all of this is happening, that all of this is going on.
[02:43:22.534 --> 02:43:28.902]  Meanwhile, our society's gotten so decadent, the police are still searching for a woman who threw a newborn out of the car.
[02:43:28.942 --> 02:43:29.583]  That's alleged.
[02:43:29.643 --> 02:43:30.304]  A man and a woman.
[02:43:32.108 --> 02:43:39.834]  Tied a newborn baby in a plastic bag and tossed him out of a car before driving off Thursday afternoon to Broward Sheriff's Office.
[02:43:40.135 --> 02:43:43.317]  Why not just take the baby into the hospital or give it up for adoption?
[02:43:44.038 --> 02:43:44.538]  Scum.
[02:43:44.598 --> 02:43:45.659]  Guaranteed to be on drugs.
[02:43:46.019 --> 02:43:49.622]  The baby survived, apparently unharmed, after landing on grass.
[02:43:49.662 --> 02:43:54.226]  Yeah, the social services will have that baby on 10 different drugs within 12 months in Washington.
[02:43:54.895 --> 02:44:02.581]  Sheriff Spokesman Veta Coleman writes to the infant boy who was only about an hour old when he was tossed out of the white sedan.
[02:44:02.621 --> 02:44:05.903]  It was a miracle child who suffered no broken bones, scratches, or bruises.
[02:44:06.443 --> 02:44:07.924]  Well, how do they know it was tossed out of the car?
[02:44:08.605 --> 02:44:12.988]  He's being listed in critical condition as a precaution, but we're hoping he'll be upgraded soon, she said.
[02:44:14.142 --> 02:44:25.205]  And the reason, I guess they can say that is that somebody supposedly saw it at 2.15 p.m., saw it slow down near the corner of Southwest 73rd Avenue in Southwest 8th Court in North Lauderdale.
[02:44:25.585 --> 02:44:31.086]  Coleman Wright said either the woman in the passenger seat or the male driver tossed the baby out of the passenger side window.
[02:44:32.607 --> 02:44:33.247]  Crackheads.
[02:44:33.307 --> 02:44:38.128]  I bet you a million dollars that they're on that CIA product.
[02:44:39.588 --> 02:44:40.369]  Unbelievable.
[02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:41.789]  Just so sick.
[02:44:43.909 --> 02:44:45.170]  Oh, man.
[02:44:46.952 --> 02:44:47.893]  This makes me sick.
[02:44:48.433 --> 02:44:53.458]  We read a couple articles yesterday where they're stun gunning 14-year-olds and they have heart attacks.
[02:44:53.478 --> 02:44:55.240]  Well, here's another one out of CBS News.
[02:44:56.501 --> 02:45:00.224]  Stun gun deaths, jolts, Chicago cops, a man died for Chicago police.
[02:45:00.244 --> 02:45:01.085]  He's a taser gun.
[02:45:01.625 --> 02:45:03.147]  Subdue him Thursday.
[02:45:04.722 --> 02:45:10.385]  Just days after a teenager was critically injured, a similar incident that prompted a lawsuit, got critically injured, had a heart attack.
[02:45:11.165 --> 02:45:16.947]  The heart now is jiggling all over the place in weird fibrillations.
[02:45:18.348 --> 02:45:23.330]  And at the same time, another person, another child was stun gunned and is now retarded.
[02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:25.591]  Wasn't retarded before, now since they're drooling.
[02:45:26.352 --> 02:45:29.593]  And Taser International's answer is to boost the power.
[02:45:30.245 --> 02:45:38.331]  Police said they used the stun gun when they were unable to restrain a 54-year-old man who was fighting with officers in a high-rise building of the city's north side Thursday afternoon.
[02:45:38.971 --> 02:45:42.593]  The man went into cardiac arrest and later died, according to the Chicago Fire Department.
[02:45:43.494 --> 02:45:47.477]  What happened to beating somebody in the legs or back with your billy club?
[02:45:48.798 --> 02:45:50.078]  Isn't that more fun for you?
[02:45:50.779 --> 02:45:51.620]  Being sarcastic.
[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:54.221]  It's like well over 80 deaths now.
[02:45:54.241 --> 02:45:55.362]  It was 80 a week ago.
[02:45:55.402 --> 02:45:55.742]  It's like 82 now.
[02:45:57.824 --> 02:46:00.630]  In just the last few years, and their answer is boost the power.
[02:46:04.539 --> 02:46:07.787]  Parents protest student computer ID tags, Associated Press.
[02:46:08.436 --> 02:46:15.358]  The only grade school in its rural town is requiring students to wear radio frequency identification badges that contract their every move.
[02:46:15.738 --> 02:46:18.459]  Some parents are outraged, fearing it will take away the children's privacy.
[02:46:18.739 --> 02:46:21.500]  The badge is introduced at Britain Elementary School.
[02:46:22.061 --> 02:46:28.583]  January 18th, rely on the same radio frequency scanner technology that companies use to track livestock and product inventory.
[02:46:28.623 --> 02:46:33.945]  Similar devices have recently been used to monitor youngsters in some parts of Japan.
[02:46:34.305 --> 02:46:35.565]  Friends of mine will be good slaves.
[02:46:35.825 --> 02:46:37.606]  But a few American schools, over 100,
[02:46:39.568 --> 02:46:46.330]  A few American school districts have embraced such a monitoring system, and civil liberties groups hope to keep it that way.
[02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:50.691]  If the school doesn't stand up, then other schools might adopt it.
[02:46:51.391 --> 02:47:02.494]  And Nicole Ozer, a representative of the American Civil Liberties Union, said, warned such school board members at a meeting Tuesday night, you might be a small community, but you are one of the first communities to use this technology.
[02:47:03.114 --> 02:47:04.035]  It's not true.
[02:47:04.515 --> 02:47:08.876]  Over a thousand school districts make you thumbprint to get food, no cash allowed.
[02:47:09.474 --> 02:47:10.775]  Training you for the control grid.
[02:47:12.135 --> 02:47:17.758]  World Net Daily is very upset about students awarded for Bush-Hitler project.
[02:47:17.878 --> 02:47:18.898]  This is out of Rhode Island.
[02:47:18.918 --> 02:47:19.999]  I bet it's one of our listeners.
[02:47:20.599 --> 02:47:23.500]  Compares President's policies to Nazis' pillage of Europe.
[02:47:24.101 --> 02:47:24.961]  I totally agree.
[02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:26.802]  I've got a film coming out that details this.
[02:47:27.711 --> 02:47:44.007]  And Jeffrey Eaton, a 17-year-old, won the project, a Rhode Island high school student, won an art award and an A from his teacher for building an abstract scene that juxtaposes Nazi swastikas and quotes of Adolf Hitler with American flags, desert-colored toy soldiers, and an image of President Bush.
[02:47:44.508 --> 02:47:45.389]  I think it's quite nice.
[02:47:46.016 --> 02:47:51.638]  Jeffrey Eden, 17, insisted he was trying to make comparisons between U.S.-led war in Iraq and the German Blitzkrieg.
[02:47:51.678 --> 02:47:57.060]  Well, a bunch of the operations had German Blitzkrieg names, and Rumsfeld called it a Blitzkrieg.
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:14.006]  I mean, you know, we're just... But his piece titled Bush-Hitler and How History Repeats Itself immediately prompted a complaint after it was displayed at a store where other winners of the Rhode Island Scholastic Art Awards, Paul Lewis, 34, of North Providence...
[02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:18.873]  Found the artwork offensive and notified me after asking them to be removed.
[02:48:19.714 --> 02:48:27.720]  They arrested one guy in New York for artwork he had at an art display of Bush's face made up of the images of monkeys.
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.942]  I mean, again, it's thought crime, folks.
[02:48:31.383 --> 02:48:31.684]  See?
[02:48:31.724 --> 02:48:32.584]  Nazi Germany.
[02:48:32.644 --> 02:48:34.806]  I mean, yes, you're making our point for us.
[02:48:35.947 --> 02:48:36.988]  What's wrong with you?
[02:48:38.509 --> 02:48:42.112]  And as our guest mentioned, the ADL and others are running around promoting these Nazi policies.
[02:48:44.378 --> 02:48:51.220]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:52.900]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:55.321]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:55.461 --> 02:48:57.541]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:57.822 --> 02:49:02.743]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:03.083 --> 02:49:07.124]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:07.384 --> 02:49:09.146]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:09.226 --> 02:49:19.877]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and findable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.037 --> 02:49:21.919]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:48.228 --> 02:51:49.769]  This show is documented.
[02:51:50.249 --> 02:51:52.989]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:59.091]  Alright, I was sent this video clip that somebody videotaped off TV, so it sounds horrible, but it's on record.
[02:51:59.131 --> 02:51:59.771]  Bush said this.
[02:51:59.791 --> 02:52:02.371]  It was on Drudge and AP a couple days ago.
[02:52:02.731 --> 02:52:11.013]  Here's the audio of Bush talking about how great America is and telling a woman who has these children that she works three jobs how great it is.
[02:52:11.673 --> 02:52:13.054]  Here's Lord Bush.
[02:52:13.774 --> 02:52:14.274]  Here's the clip.
[02:52:15.928 --> 02:52:16.688]  All right, that's good.
[02:52:16.708 --> 02:52:17.709]  And it goes on some more.
[02:52:17.769 --> 02:52:18.609]  But, yeah, three jobs.
[02:52:18.629 --> 02:52:23.011]  You can't be home with your children so the television and the state can raise them.
[02:52:23.131 --> 02:52:24.292]  Very conservative.
[02:52:44.711 --> 02:52:45.351]  Newsday.
[02:52:45.731 --> 02:52:47.952]  Court to decide access to 9-11 tapes.
[02:52:48.052 --> 02:52:56.015]  Albany, New York State's highest court heard arguments Wednesday to a two-year struggle over access to a trove of city transcripts and tape recordings from September 11, 2001.
[02:52:57.155 --> 02:53:01.677]  At issue, the Court of Appeals has access to the 9-11 firefighter tapes.
[02:53:02.623 --> 02:53:07.946]  And firefighter dispatches and transcripts of interviews with hundreds of firefighters that responded on the day of the attack.
[02:53:07.966 --> 02:53:14.549]  Now, first they claimed that all the tapes malfunctioned, then they claimed there were no interviews, now they declared national security, and now it's going to court.
[02:53:15.069 --> 02:53:17.350]  Remember, they ordered the FAA to shred the tapes.
[02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:18.851]  That's mainstream news.
[02:53:19.892 --> 02:53:24.794]  They ordered the firefighters to say they hadn't found the black boxes, three of the four black boxes.
[02:53:26.092 --> 02:53:27.273]  That's been in the news.
[02:53:27.633 --> 02:53:29.314]  Again, covering it all up.
[02:53:29.414 --> 02:53:30.135]  Why is that?
[02:53:30.195 --> 02:53:32.656]  Well, because it was an inside job.
[02:53:33.137 --> 02:53:37.139]  Also, CNN, Inside Politics, White House Reporters Credentials questioned.
[02:53:37.379 --> 02:53:40.601]  He was given a fake name because he really worked for the White House.
[02:53:40.981 --> 02:53:42.062]  They have fake reporters.
[02:53:42.102 --> 02:53:48.866]  Not just reporters they pay off, but actual government agents posing as reporters working for major publications.
[02:53:49.886 --> 02:53:50.787]  It's massive, people.
[02:53:52.047 --> 02:53:52.327]  U.S.
[02:53:52.347 --> 02:53:54.349]  trade gap hits record in 2004 to $496.5 billion.
[02:53:54.369 --> 02:53:55.910]  And it just gets... I'm sorry, that was 2003.
[02:53:55.950 --> 02:53:56.290]  It's $671.7 billion.
[02:53:56.390 --> 02:54:00.873]  Excuse me, it's increased by hundreds of billions.
[02:54:00.913 --> 02:54:02.454]  I was reading 2003's numbers.
[02:54:02.474 --> 02:54:04.755]  Britain accused over CIA secret torture flights, London Independent.
[02:54:18.946 --> 02:54:26.391]  UK airports are believed to be used, along with British support, to carry people out of foreign countries to third-party countries for torture.
[02:54:27.292 --> 02:54:28.993]  It's into that new freedom.
[02:54:30.414 --> 02:54:32.195]  And, oh, there's so much more.
[02:54:32.315 --> 02:54:34.337]  But I'm just flat out of time.
[02:54:34.817 --> 02:54:37.559]  FDA says it doesn't matter if there have been scores of deaths from Ritalin.
[02:54:37.579 --> 02:54:39.120]  They're not going to pull it from the market.
[02:54:40.081 --> 02:54:42.022]  And a bunch of other important information.
[02:54:42.842 --> 02:54:46.944]  Before I end this hour and the next 60, 70 seconds, grab a pen and paper, folks!
[02:54:47.565 --> 02:54:51.447]  If you believe in what we're doing, if you want to support us, that's secondary, but it also does that.
