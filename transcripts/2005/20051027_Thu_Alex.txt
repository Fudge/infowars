[00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:06.387]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:08.108]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:09.929]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.390]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.031]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:21.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:36.228]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:49.516]  It may now just be emerging that Roberts, the new Supreme Court Chief Justice, is anti-gun, and that is confirmed now from multiple sources, including CBS News.
[00:00:50.657 --> 00:00:59.282]  But at least we are successfully shooting down Myers, who is overtly
[00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.220]  Bad on every front.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.741]  If you're a conservative, she's bad.
[00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:04.762]  If you're a liberal, she's bad.
[00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:08.185]  If you're a truth lover and a freedom lover, she's really bad.
[00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:10.506]  Every angle.
[00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:19.452]  And I was talking to somebody last night, a little bird, just a little bird that might work in the White House.
[00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.433]  I'll put it to you that way.
[00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:28.659]  If the conservatives only knew the full details of Meyers...
[00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.254]  And that's as far as I'm going to go.
[00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:36.677]  But folks, this source is right there.
[00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.102]  And, well, Myers is pretty trendy.
[00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:45.004]  We'll just leave it there for you today.
[00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:50.788]  All the big money she gave to the Democrats, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:51.208]  So what?
[00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:52.609]  Give money to Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
[00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:56.012]  They're all just operatives of the Bush-Crown family to begin with, but
[00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:03.219]  Myers has withdrawn the Supreme Court nomination, and now have they worn us out?
[00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.379]  Now will they try Alberto Gonzalez on us?
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100]  They sent that trial balloon up, remember?
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:24.883]  Bush in two different speeches and press conferences mentioned in a speech in a press conference that that would probably be his pick, and people began actually having convulsions of anger because it's so overt.
[00:02:25.752 --> 00:02:44.426]  I heard some mealy-mouthed neocon caller last night call into one of the Genesis broadcasts, and the host was talking about how George Bush is out Clinton and Clinton, and the caller says, I just can't believe that about W.
[00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:48.293]  I just, you know, we've got to trust him.
[00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.394]  Myers must be good.
[00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:52.254]  W says she is.
[00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:55.695]  I mean, what is your major malfunction?
[00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:59.917]  You guys will defend Bush no matter what he does.
[00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:06.839]  He could take your grandpa's shotgun out of your gun case, melt it down right in front of you.
[00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:10.712]  And you would still go, that's conservative.
[00:03:10.853 --> 00:03:12.093]  It is not conservative.
[00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:14.695]  Alright, I'm already beating the dead horse.
[00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:16.956]  We'll give you more details of this after the break.
[00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:33.446]  Dozens have been subpoenaed in hospital deaths in Louisiana, according to AP, but the police, FEMA, none of them are going to get arrested, none of them are going to get in trouble, and that's where the lion's share of the culpability lies.
[00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:47.986]  And I guess with some of the people who died, with some of their children, I mean, if my parents were stuck in a nursing home and the police were trying to stop me from getting into them and they were dying, let me just tell you something right now.
[00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:50.167]  They'd be burying me.
[00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:51.788]  I'd die trying.
[00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.613]  And that's not like some, ooh, that's a radical, courage-laden statement.
[00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:05.719]  Something's wrong with you if you wouldn't kill to save your children or your parents or your wife.
[00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.880]  But even with a wife, I don't think it goes as deep as children or parents.
[00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:26.087]  Folks, I just... Remember the story of the parish emergency manager who wasn't allowed in for like four days?
[00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:29.029]  The media made a big deal that the parish president was wrong.
[00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.110]  It wasn't five days, it was four days.
[00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.950]  Oh, okay.
[00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:33.711]  Wasn't allowed in.
[00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:38.594]  I mean, he was the emergency management head there in the county, and FEMA wouldn't let him in, and his mother died.
[00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:46.069]  Now, I tell you, you get in the way of me and my mama, you're going to be in some serious, you're going to have a serious problem.
[00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.653]  I mean, I just can't believe we've been this domesticated.
[00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.355]  You sit right there while your mama dies, you understand?
[00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:55.298]  Yes, sir, I'll sit right here while my mama dies.
[00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:57.160]  Who wouldn't go save their mother?
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.243]  All right, we'll talk about this, talk about the indictments, it's all coming up.
[00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:05.447]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:07.288]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:12.290]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.072]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:21.654]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:24.735]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:29.476]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:34.097]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:41.539]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:44.220]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.120]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:04.798]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:05.138 --> 00:06:08.020]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.443]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:22.146]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:26.348]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:26.488 --> 00:06:27.028]  We're good to go.
[00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:55.872]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:04.204]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:06.565]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:08.906]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:11.527]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:14.628]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:16.049]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:21.691]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:26.353]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease as well as undue emotional stress.
[00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:32.880]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.047]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes and all health-minded individuals.
[00:07:39.328 --> 00:07:41.510]  The Unmedical Miracle Oxygen is a book
[00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.750]  That's 888-224-7416.
[00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:04.315]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:07.736]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:29.064]  Well, everyone's hyperventilating, turning blue in the face, waiting to hear how many of the king's men are going to be indicted.
[00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:32.458]  Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall.
[00:08:33.118 --> 00:08:35.659]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:44.963]  All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put George Bush, the little cokehead homosexual, together again.
[00:08:46.143 --> 00:08:50.245]  All right, now I'm really out of control today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:52.606]  I think you're beginning to realize that.
[00:08:52.806 --> 00:08:55.107]  I'm just getting sick and tired of all of it.
[00:08:56.716 --> 00:09:11.863]  Rabin's memorial, the 10th anniversary of when Israel, elements in their government, killed Yishak Rabin, and we have the amazing reporter who's written for the Jerusalem Post, you name it, joining us.
[00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:19.447]  Rabin's memorial, the 10th anniversary, Rabin memorial postponed so Clinton can attend.
[00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.992]  And we'll get into how he was murdered.
[00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:24.533]  That's coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:09:25.113 --> 00:09:27.034]  And a bunch of other issues out of Israel.
[00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:30.216]  It aired on Israeli television.
[00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:31.997]  It was in a few of the major newspapers.
[00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:37.381]  Barry Hamish had written about it before, but he was shocked to see them admit it.
[00:09:38.762 --> 00:09:43.205]  And what were they shocked to see?
[00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:49.609]  The Ringworm Children, translated in Hebrew as...
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.081]  100,000 Rage.
[00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:59.564]  And, of course, they gave them the dehumanizing name, the Ringworm Children, as if they were some type of worm or something.
[00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:05.107]  Simply put, it is athlete's foot on your head or on your skin.
[00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:16.353]  A certain type of fungus grows in a circle, in a circular pattern, similar to how you'll see circular patterns of moss or algae.
[00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:25.405]  We're fungus growing on a rock under a tree, and so it will make your hair fall out in the area where the fungus grows.
[00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:30.207]  And, you know, old wives' tale superstition is, that's ringworm.
[00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:32.268]  But they had lots of reasons.
[00:10:32.968 --> 00:10:41.932]  That's just something that, a term that got seized upon by the government, I guess, to kind of demonize the children, was to just give it the term ringworm.
[00:10:41.972 --> 00:10:46.034]  But they would tell the children, you're going to have dental work done, or...
[00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:49.030]  You're going to be checked for lice.
[00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.392]  You're going to have a treatment for ringworm, even when they didn't have ringworm.
[00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:58.455]  And pretty much everybody's had ringworm one time or another.
[00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:02.917]  I mean, I've never had it where it made my hair fall out, or, you know, where I got a really big bloody circle.
[00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:13.622]  But if you've ever, you know, the spring ends, it's warm weather, you go swimming at the local pool, you get a sunburn,
[00:11:14.446 --> 00:11:20.130]  And then all of a sudden, you get maybe on your leg or your chest a little bitty white circle, just teeny little spots.
[00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.072]  Well, that's fungus, and the sun killed it.
[00:11:24.313 --> 00:11:26.494]  Why am I doing a dissertation on fungus?
[00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:27.855]  That's not what we're talking about.
[00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:30.357]  See, I have problems focusing.
[00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:31.537]  Maybe I need red one.
[00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:33.659]  But maybe I need radiation.
[00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:38.102]  Maybe I need to be given 35,000 times the safe level because our government loves us.
[00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:41.945]  I wonder if I'm going to be criticized by the ADL.
[00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:57.930]  I'm wondering if there will be a big intelligence report about me, as there has in the past, full of complete lies, things I never said, because I'm about to try to defend the memory of these murdered children, because I'm against killing Jewish children.
[00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:04.353]  Yes, and I'm against Arnold, who says he admires Hitler, so I must like Hitler.
[00:12:06.094 --> 00:12:07.596]  I'm not even being sarcastic now, folks.
[00:12:07.616 --> 00:12:08.997]  This is how crazy things have gotten.
[00:12:09.017 --> 00:12:10.238]  So this is Barry Hamish writing.
[00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:31.635]  The Ringworm Children, directed by David Belhassen and Asher Himas, recently won the prize for Best Documentary at the Hoffa International Film Festival, and in the past year has made the rounds of Jewish and Israeli film festivals around the world.
[00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:35.358]  But it has yet to come to Israeli television screens.
[00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:46.740]  But it did, ladies and gentlemen, and let me just read from this article that Barry Hamish wrote for Israel Insider.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:13:01.672]  In 1951, the Director General of Israeli Health Ministry, Dr. Chiem Sheba, flew to America and returned with seven x-ray machines supplied to him by the American Army.
[00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:11.852]  They were to be used in mass atomic experiments with an entire generation of Sephardi youths to be used as guinea pigs.
[00:13:13.433 --> 00:13:23.521]  Every Sephardi child was to be given 35,000 times the maximum dose of x-rays through the head.
[00:13:24.802 --> 00:13:29.546]  For doing so, the American government, this is all admitted now, paid the Israeli government $300 million
[00:13:31.872 --> 00:13:33.593]  Israeli liras a year.
[00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:37.175]  The entire health budget was $60 million at the time, a year.
[00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:41.438]  The money paid by the Americans is equivalent to billions of dollars today.
[00:13:41.898 --> 00:13:46.280]  To fool the parents of the victims, the children were taken away on school trips.
[00:13:46.461 --> 00:13:48.162]  Good reason to have your kids in public school.
[00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:50.303]  Oh, by the way, of course, this went on here, too.
[00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:52.644]  That's a whole other subject.
[00:13:52.964 --> 00:13:57.807]  Your loving government murders children with extreme enjoyment.
[00:13:58.948 --> 00:14:00.929]  But let's give all our firearms up to the government.
[00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:08.072]  You know, let's reverse the order of things where the government is now our boss and we're disarmed and the nice men in black masks keep us safe.
[00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:20.756]  To fool the parents of the victims, the children were taken away on school trips and their parents were later told that x-rays were the treatment for the scourge of scalpel ringworm.
[00:14:21.136 --> 00:14:21.236]  Oh!
[00:14:22.516 --> 00:14:28.058]  6,000 of the children died shortly after their doses were given while many of the rest developed cancers that killed them over time.
[00:14:29.018 --> 00:14:30.159]  Most of them actually died in a year.
[00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:31.239]  I've got more documents on this.
[00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.924]  And are still killing them today.
[00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:42.367]  While living, the victims suffered from disorders such as epilepsy, amnesia, Alzheimer's disease, chronic headaches, and psychosis.
[00:14:43.887 --> 00:15:01.393]  And folks, they took healthy, happy little children as the communist government, the socialist government of Israel, the Zionist labor leaders of it, that's what Hamish calls them, Israel's labor Zionist founders,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.361]  They saw them as cattle.
[00:15:05.302 --> 00:15:17.492]  And by the way, these are the same people that when Hitler said, and this is admitted, two million dollars, and you can have millions of Jews.
[00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:19.734]  Just a small bounty will let you have them.
[00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:26.619]  And the head Zionist at the time wrote, one cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Europe.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.143]  Either they're only sent here, not to Europe or the U.S., or you can kill them.
[00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:33.091]  Now, that's on record.
[00:15:33.712 --> 00:15:36.113]  And I'm sorry the ADL doesn't want you to know that.
[00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:38.514]  I mean, I'm really sorry about that.
[00:15:39.214 --> 00:15:43.556]  But they can't hide it, and a whole bunch of universities have been reporting on it.
[00:15:43.616 --> 00:15:51.399]  These were published, the major Zionist publications of the time, letters to Hitler, communiques.
[00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:58.722]  There's a whole squadron of Jewish groups constantly exposing this, their outrage, who had family killed.
[00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:17.041]  And the moral of the story is that the Zionist leadership of Israel, people calling themselves the current crop of Zionists that founded Israel, actually see the Jews of Israel as cattle just as much as they see everybody else as cattle.
[00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:19.902]  Or insects, or useless feeders, eaters.
[00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.084]  I mean, it's really disgusting.
[00:16:25.045 --> 00:16:29.387]  And I don't know why Steven Spielberg and people like that don't expose it.
[00:16:29.427 --> 00:16:29.607]  I mean...
[00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:32.531]  I guess they really just don't care.
[00:16:33.572 --> 00:16:34.794]  It's all hot air, folks.
[00:16:34.854 --> 00:16:37.276]  It's all political correct bull.
[00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:42.922]  You know, nowadays you say, hey, I'm against our borders being wide open and losing all our jobs.
[00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:44.925]  Oh, you're probably anti-Semitic.
[00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:47.868]  You know, I think we should cut taxes, so that's good for anti-Semitic.
[00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:52.553]  I think the World Bank documents are showing that they're trying to destroy economies by design.
[00:16:53.857 --> 00:16:54.877]  It's very predatory.
[00:16:55.417 --> 00:16:56.438]  Oh, shut up.
[00:16:56.478 --> 00:16:58.058]  Talk about a World Bank or IMF.
[00:16:58.098 --> 00:16:58.598]  Code word.
[00:16:58.638 --> 00:16:59.098]  Code word.
[00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:01.499]  They actually have manuals that say it's code word.
[00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:02.539]  Oh, really?
[00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:08.480]  When Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, quit and released these documents, was he code wording then?
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.980]  I mean, what does this even mean?
[00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:13.901]  It's something to shut off debate, to shut off discussions.
[00:17:14.461 --> 00:17:17.902]  But I'm telling you, this is the Achilles heel of the Zionists, folks.
[00:17:17.962 --> 00:17:21.463]  It's the fact that they're really the equivalent of Nazis.
[00:17:22.478 --> 00:17:25.821]  And I'm not the only person that's made that correlation.
[00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:26.541]  It's blaring.
[00:17:28.383 --> 00:17:29.183]  But imagine.
[00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:32.967]  Imagine.
[00:17:36.069 --> 00:17:43.015]  What it's like to have 35,000 times the safe level of radiation pumped through your brain.
[00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:51.201]  And imagine being the doctors that did it with the seven machines over ten years chronicling the data for the U.S.
[00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:51.982]  Defense Department.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:18:04.182]  So people have trouble believing, even though one of the Israeli pilots has gone public, that Israel on purpose attacked the USS Liberty in 1967 in conjunction with the Pentagon and LBJ and McNamara.
[00:18:04.202 --> 00:18:04.963]  This is admitted now.
[00:18:06.123 --> 00:18:09.504]  Again, I've had the admirals on who took the call from LBJ.
[00:18:09.904 --> 00:18:10.824]  Don't help that ship.
[00:18:10.884 --> 00:18:11.784]  I want it going to the bottom.
[00:18:12.444 --> 00:18:13.344]  It's not the exact quote.
[00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:14.685]  That GD ship's going to the bottom.
[00:18:15.245 --> 00:18:16.145]  Turn those planes around.
[00:18:17.768 --> 00:18:21.991]  I've been talking a lot about that because it's just such an illustration of the cold-blooded nature.
[00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:29.557]  People have trouble believing Israel would bomb one of our ships and try to kill everybody to blame it, attack it for hours, couldn't get it sunk.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.163]  Oh, you don't think they'd kill 130-something American sailors and marines?
[00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:41.206]  Oh, but they'd admittedly radiate 100,000, 100,000 children.
[00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:51.171]  I mean, that is incredible.
[00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:57.373]  Has the Aryan Nations ever in America... Imagine if they grabbed one Jewish child and radiated them.
[00:18:58.293 --> 00:19:00.813]  I mean, it'd be endless headlines, endless news, and it should.
[00:19:00.833 --> 00:19:14.056]  Can you imagine if the Aryan Nations or some other group like that, hypothetically, or if a black group grabbed a white person, or a white group grabbed a black person, or any other group?
[00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:16.596]  I mean, how is Israel allowed to do this?
[00:19:16.636 --> 00:19:19.157]  Well, our own government did it, but more piecemeal.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.941]  All over the country, but that also racked up into the tens of thousands.
[00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:26.382]  But mainly here, they would take kids in state custody.
[00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:31.263]  Orphanages, children who were mentally disabled.
[00:19:32.803 --> 00:19:34.464]  Yeah, they'd kill them.
[00:19:34.824 --> 00:19:37.045]  That's even been in PBS documentaries.
[00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:39.685]  Imagine, take a little kid in, man, and just zap him.
[00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:42.326]  Yep, I'm going to turn my guns in.
[00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:43.766]  I'm going to submit to the government.
[00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:44.847]  I'm going to do everything they say.
[00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:45.987]  I'm going to trust them.
[00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.233]  I love my government.
[00:19:48.273 --> 00:19:49.313]  My government's God.
[00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:53.515]  And being patriotic means not asking questions and worshiping the government.
[00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:58.937]  So, being sarcastic, folks, this is why I'm boiling with anger.
[00:19:59.257 --> 00:20:03.699]  None of us have said it.
[00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:05.880]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.681]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:08.863 --> 00:20:16.745]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.606]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:21.006]  's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:29.268]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:30.208]  We're good to go.
[00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:04.068]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.468 --> 00:21:09.952]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.532 --> 00:21:11.032]  That's right.
[00:21:11.352 --> 00:21:13.634]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.954 --> 00:21:21.119]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:29.387]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.808 --> 00:21:34.673]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.313 --> 00:21:38.316]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:41.359]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.184 --> 00:22:04.665]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.044]  Government is best which governs me.
[00:23:03.624 --> 00:23:04.924]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.085]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:08.525 --> 00:23:11.166]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:11.606 --> 00:23:18.088]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.361]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:40.881]  Have you?
[00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:42.983]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.344]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9622.
[00:23:49.124 --> 00:23:51.167]  Only our president would listen to his God.
[00:23:51.628 --> 00:23:52.649]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.432]  Osama bin forgotten.
[00:23:54.872 --> 00:23:58.518]  Go to libertystickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:24:15.145 --> 00:24:16.566]  I guess I should feel dirty.
[00:24:17.926 --> 00:24:18.926]  I should apologize.
[00:24:19.806 --> 00:24:21.087]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:22.527]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:22.607 --> 00:24:29.128]  I won't talk about how Israel radiated 100,000 of its own children, the majority of which died.
[00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:31.409]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:33.889]  Radiating children is good.
[00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:35.770]  But of course you know it's not good.
[00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.730]  You know when Jeffrey Dahmer grabs some
[00:24:38.387 --> 00:24:40.988]  12-year-old off the street and takes them and tortures them.
[00:24:41.408 --> 00:24:42.248]  You know it's wrong.
[00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:51.552]  So why, when government does it to black men or Appalachian white kids or Jewish children, why is it okay, you scumbags?
[00:24:52.632 --> 00:24:53.753]  I'm talking to you, government.
[00:24:53.973 --> 00:24:54.233]  Hey!
[00:24:54.513 --> 00:24:55.413]  I'm talking to you!
[00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:58.135]  Stop feeling sorry for yourselves.
[00:24:58.415 --> 00:25:00.075]  Stop acting like you're so good.
[00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:02.176]  Stop acting like you're giving us something.
[00:25:02.436 --> 00:25:03.797]  Stop acting like you're God.
[00:25:03.837 --> 00:25:04.597]  You're not God.
[00:25:04.797 --> 00:25:05.417]  You're dirty.
[00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:06.238]  You're shameful.
[00:25:06.378 --> 00:25:07.078]  You're pathetic.
[00:25:10.399 --> 00:25:11.540]  Let's play this clip.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.480]  You haven't heard this in a while.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.240]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:19.964]  The guy who runs this building I'm in, emergency management, he's responsible for everything.
[00:25:20.404 --> 00:25:22.505]  His mother was trapped in St.
[00:25:22.525 --> 00:25:23.545]  Bernard Nursing Home.
[00:25:23.986 --> 00:25:27.827]  And every day she called him and said, Are you coming, son?
[00:25:28.168 --> 00:25:29.208]  Is somebody coming?
[00:25:29.668 --> 00:25:30.809]  And he said, Yeah, mama.
[00:25:31.209 --> 00:25:32.729]  Somebody's coming to get you!
[00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.470]  Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday!
[00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.491]  Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday!
[00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:40.072]  Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday!
[00:25:40.632 --> 00:25:42.592]  Somebody's coming to get you on Friday!
[00:25:43.032 --> 00:25:44.033]  And she drowned it!
[00:25:44.413 --> 00:25:45.273]  Friday night!
[00:25:45.913 --> 00:25:47.574]  She drowned it Friday night!
[00:25:48.694 --> 00:25:51.595]  Mr. President... Nobody's coming to get us!
[00:25:52.348 --> 00:25:54.549]  Nobody's coming to get us.
[00:25:54.589 --> 00:25:56.009]  The Secretary has promised.
[00:25:56.189 --> 00:25:57.330]  Everybody's promised.
[00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.850]  They've had press conferences.
[00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.711]  I'm sick of the press conferences.
[00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:04.792]  For God's sake, shut up and send us away.
[00:26:05.212 --> 00:26:06.212]  Save us, government.
[00:26:06.272 --> 00:26:06.732]  Save us.
[00:26:07.392 --> 00:26:12.934]  No, all FEMA did was hold the police back and hold the firemen and the volunteers back.
[00:26:13.741 --> 00:26:17.485]  And they tried to deny that story was true, but it was true.
[00:26:17.545 --> 00:26:27.935]  And we all know it took them almost five full days to even get to the hospitals to allow the military and others to fly in with food and water to the hospitals.
[00:26:28.015 --> 00:26:32.859]  And so hundreds, hundreds of people died in one hospital alone.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.341]  Hundreds.
[00:26:35.879 --> 00:26:37.500]  Because of the bureaucracy.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.143]  Because FEMA had to have things break down first so they'd get even more funding.
[00:26:42.424 --> 00:26:43.905]  They cut police lines.
[00:26:45.225 --> 00:26:46.546]  They sabotaged lines.
[00:26:46.867 --> 00:26:51.130]  They were jamming police communications as the hurricane came in.
[00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.591]  This was their big plan.
[00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:53.651]  And you know what?
[00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:55.553]  Everybody thinks they're, quote, bad now.
[00:26:55.573 --> 00:26:56.233]  They screwed up.
[00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:58.434]  Let's punish them with double funding.
[00:27:00.156 --> 00:27:01.356]  Oh, I'm sorry I screwed up.
[00:27:01.397 --> 00:27:03.318]  Thanks for all the new funding and the big raises.
[00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:12.755]  Meanwhile, they're busy running around prosecuting a bunch of people who are culpable, but nothing compared to the godlike government.
[00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:19.377]  But again, the godlike government that is our authority, our official, our king.
[00:27:20.277 --> 00:27:21.757]  Now, America is the opposite.
[00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:22.918]  It was supposed to be, but not anymore.
[00:27:22.938 --> 00:27:24.658]  So you notice all the terms have changed.
[00:27:24.898 --> 00:27:26.378]  We're the civilians.
[00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:28.339]  They're the militarized government.
[00:27:29.841 --> 00:27:32.122]  Dozens subpoenaed in hospital deaths.
[00:27:32.162 --> 00:27:34.922]  Louisiana Attorney General investigates fatalities after Katrina.
[00:27:35.462 --> 00:27:47.225]  Louisiana Attorney General's office subpoenaed 73 employees at Memorial Medical Center on Wednesday as part of its investigation of deaths in hospitals and nursing homes in New Orleans area during and after Hurricane Katrina.
[00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:49.706]  And they've already charged a bunch of people.
[00:27:51.050 --> 00:28:04.566]  And imagine, a lot of the hospital staff, in fact most of them, and a lot of the nursing home staff, actually stayed there when there was no food, no water, except for tepid disease water up to their ankles, up to their knees in many cases.
[00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:08.751]  They stayed there and did take care of people, but others had children across town.
[00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:11.915]  They had to get back home.
[00:28:11.955 --> 00:28:12.736]  Things are flooding.
[00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:20.477]  I'm doing the night shift here at the local nursing home, and my kids are going to be waking up soon, and my husband's there.
[00:28:20.817 --> 00:28:21.518]  I've got to go.
[00:28:23.098 --> 00:28:29.379]  Or I'm divorced, and my wife isn't home with the kids.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.200]  My kids are teenagers.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.760]  This is hypothetical, folks.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.261]  Please, I don't have teenage kids.
[00:28:35.321 --> 00:28:35.841]  I'm talking about...
[00:28:36.488 --> 00:28:38.369]  You know, the cases I read about in the newspaper.
[00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:41.290]  And so they try to get back and take care of their teenage kids.
[00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:42.131]  Boom!
[00:28:42.491 --> 00:28:43.551]  You're charged with murder.
[00:28:44.852 --> 00:28:54.817]  Now, the police, though, will tell you, and in all these court cases it's been stated, they don't have a compulsion to protect you.
[00:28:54.857 --> 00:28:55.937]  Quote, it's not their job.
[00:28:56.558 --> 00:29:01.740]  They're not liable when they don't show up for 20 minutes and you get gutted inside your house.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.642]  You know, you hear these weirdo domesticated slaves
[00:29:06.354 --> 00:29:09.157]  These anti-gun people, I was on the web yesterday reading it.
[00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:11.519]  One thing was attacking me.
[00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:15.822]  How dare Alex Jones be pro-gun?
[00:29:15.862 --> 00:29:19.065]  Why doesn't he just call the cops if he needs help with something?
[00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:21.567]  What's the national average?
[00:29:21.988 --> 00:29:23.449]  12 minutes on a 911 call?
[00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:26.091]  The cops can't protect you, won't protect you.
[00:29:26.111 --> 00:29:27.813]  They try, but they're not liable to.
[00:29:28.173 --> 00:29:28.553]  But still...
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.787]  I mean, if you're going to be the authorities, the officials, then you're more culpable than anybody else.
[00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:43.910]  And really, it is the FEMA people.
[00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.111]  They need to be arrested.
[00:29:45.572 --> 00:29:47.033]  They need to serve time.
[00:29:47.413 --> 00:29:48.654]  Hard time in a prison.
[00:29:51.877 --> 00:29:52.838]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:54.900]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.483]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.175]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:04.456]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:30:04.657 --> 00:30:08.060]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.581]  Phenol?
[00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:16.029]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.434]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:30:20.554 --> 00:30:20.975]  Fragrance?
[00:30:21.355 --> 00:30:26.101]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:30.947]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:33.730]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.394]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[00:32:01.764 --> 00:32:05.145]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:32:05.385 --> 00:32:05.725]  Why?
[00:32:05.745 --> 00:32:08.686]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:33:04.263 --> 00:33:10.284]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.884 --> 00:33:13.845]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.586 --> 00:33:20.207]  I want you to image children five years of age to ten.
[00:33:20.727 --> 00:33:27.068]  They liked them really young because they couldn't then, with a lot of detail, describe it to their parents.
[00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:29.769]  You're going for a checkup now.
[00:33:30.835 --> 00:33:32.516]  Your government loves you.
[00:33:32.536 --> 00:33:35.196]  This is something to help you.
[00:33:35.316 --> 00:33:41.238]  And loading them on the little bus and driving to the clinic and going in and there's the doctor.
[00:33:41.258 --> 00:33:43.498]  Hi there, sweetie.
[00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:46.799]  We're here to just give you a little check up here.
[00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:50.640]  Come right up here and lay down up on this table.
[00:33:52.121 --> 00:33:52.661]  What's that?
[00:33:53.545 --> 00:34:00.010]  Oh, that's just something to help you in case you've got any fungus growing here.
[00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:06.874]  And then imagine walking over and getting behind a lead shielding and flipping the switch and just pumping them full of it.
[00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:10.717]  There, that'll help you.
[00:34:10.997 --> 00:34:18.142]  Again, why did the Soviets, why did the Israelis, why did our government, why did the Nazis with Joseph Mingalow
[00:34:19.386 --> 00:34:20.227]  Do things like this.
[00:34:20.347 --> 00:34:23.030]  Well, really, it's about testing a cadre of your men.
[00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.432]  It is just about... It's like the torture.
[00:34:25.873 --> 00:34:31.759]  So they torture innocent people at Camp X-Ray and Abu Ghraib and all these other camps around the world.
[00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:35.943]  Why do they torture innocent people?
[00:34:36.003 --> 00:34:37.985]  It is to create cadres...
[00:34:38.797 --> 00:34:53.529]  Torture squads, bigger and bigger squads, which then you force multiply, and then you use the television and the media to brainwash the public that torture's good, and you sell the entire planet on torture being some new virtue.
[00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:55.650]  And now you see what's happened.
[00:34:56.291 --> 00:34:58.773]  Until one day, those of us against torture are bad.
[00:35:00.347 --> 00:35:13.254]  But I want you to just picture the little children in America, the little children in Israel, the little children, picture the little children in Dr. Mingala's laboratory being sewn together, being given poisons.
[00:35:14.315 --> 00:35:16.716]  And then just tell me it's okay.
[00:35:18.557 --> 00:35:20.198]  But see, now you're going to engage in doublethink.
[00:35:20.878 --> 00:35:24.240]  Some of you support Israel no matter what they do, and our own government no matter what they do.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.941]  So Mingala bad, Israel U.S.
[00:35:25.961 --> 00:35:26.081]  good.
[00:35:28.464 --> 00:35:31.285]  Well, these aren't our government's folks, and how dare you say they are.
[00:35:31.645 --> 00:35:35.106]  And that's why you can never trust government, never let it have power over you.
[00:35:35.386 --> 00:35:37.367]  That's why it's always got to be transparent.
[00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:47.670]  But since 1947, everything they do has been under total lock and key, under a blanket of secrecy, an iron curtain of news blackout.
[00:35:49.281 --> 00:35:56.703]  And they have been busy little bees behind the scenes just doing all manner of unspeakable evil.
[00:35:57.043 --> 00:36:04.864]  Folks, if they were radiating little babies, radiating little children, then they are damned to hell.
[00:36:05.124 --> 00:36:05.785]  Don't you worry.
[00:36:07.905 --> 00:36:08.705]  Be assured of that.
[00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:12.366]  God will have his vengeance on these people while they're alive and after they're dead.
[00:36:13.686 --> 00:36:15.887]  Imagine what's going on today.
[00:36:15.927 --> 00:36:16.467]  Well, we know.
[00:36:17.654 --> 00:36:20.415]  They're, especially in China, taking babies.
[00:36:20.555 --> 00:36:25.437]  They come to your house, and the baby's two months old, and you weren't allowed to have two kids, and this is your third.
[00:36:25.457 --> 00:36:26.158]  They're really mad.
[00:36:26.698 --> 00:36:27.498]  They take the child.
[00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:31.480]  In the past, they drowned them right in front of the parents and let them keep the body.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.081]  Now they just disappear them.
[00:36:33.761 --> 00:36:34.481]  And we know.
[00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:36.022]  There have been reports coming out.
[00:36:36.062 --> 00:36:36.962]  We know where they're going.
[00:36:37.022 --> 00:36:40.984]  They're keeping these children alive, and they're doing all manner of hell to them.
[00:36:42.282 --> 00:36:46.105]  Nice tissues to grow all sorts of things in.
[00:36:46.566 --> 00:36:48.147]  Lots of bioengineering.
[00:36:48.948 --> 00:36:52.210]  You think about the 50s, them microwaving hundreds of thousands of children.
[00:36:52.611 --> 00:36:54.172]  And you think about what they're doing today.
[00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:56.834]  And listen, I'm sorry if you don't want to hear this.
[00:36:56.974 --> 00:36:57.935]  I'm real sorry.
[00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.257]  You need to figure out what government is.
[00:37:00.497 --> 00:37:02.079]  It isn't reason, it's force.
[00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:06.242]  A dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:37:07.103 --> 00:37:08.304]  It is like fire.
[00:37:09.417 --> 00:37:11.539]  Of course, that evil George Washington said that.
[00:37:11.799 --> 00:37:14.602]  No wonder I have FEMA on tape saying he is an enemy.
[00:37:15.363 --> 00:37:16.464]  He is a terrorist.
[00:37:16.544 --> 00:37:17.746]  They actually tell cops this.
[00:37:20.408 --> 00:37:21.890]  It's so sick.
[00:37:23.204 --> 00:37:27.427]  And they're putting this whole police state in so they can have their way with us.
[00:37:27.447 --> 00:37:27.988]  They love it.
[00:37:28.008 --> 00:37:28.748]  They revel in it.
[00:37:29.048 --> 00:37:32.771]  They love giving black men syphilis and letting them die of it and spread it.
[00:37:33.171 --> 00:37:35.833]  They absolutely love microwaving children.
[00:37:36.173 --> 00:37:37.554]  They love radiating them.
[00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:44.499]  They loved it in 1968, one of the thousands of declassified admissions, releasing a bioweapon in the New York subway of the U.S.
[00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:44.939]  government.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.340]  Deaths resulted.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.661]  Details are unclassified.
[00:37:48.782 --> 00:37:49.703]  Can you imagine...
[00:37:51.016 --> 00:38:07.881]  Being so cold-blooded that people are going to work, just going to work, you know, janitors and doctors and firefighters and policemen and schoolteachers, just getting on the subway in 1968 and releasing a bioweapon and then having your agents in the area hospitals to track how the people die when they come in a few days later.
[00:38:09.342 --> 00:38:15.964]  Well, the scientists in their lab coats say, well, we're doing this because we've got to study this.
[00:38:16.024 --> 00:38:17.745]  If it was to hit the entire U.S.
[00:38:17.805 --> 00:38:18.765]  in a Soviet attack...
[00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.070]  Why?
[00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.252]  This would save hundreds of millions.
[00:38:22.352 --> 00:38:32.361]  So, it may seem evil what we're doing, radiating these children and hitting the subway with biologicals, but the end justifies the means.
[00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:44.933]  Just like after Delta Force, after you've made it through Rangers and then become a Green Beret, or if you've made it up through into the SEAL teams.
[00:38:46.222 --> 00:38:51.325]  Or Marine Force Recon, and they select out of all these services.
[00:38:53.906 --> 00:39:04.331]  Now you've, say, out of three out of a hundred making it in the testing, well now you take a hundred of those and maybe ten of those guys make it.
[00:39:05.672 --> 00:39:09.113]  And after you've been through all this, you're totally dedicated, you're totally focused.
[00:39:09.433 --> 00:39:10.994]  It's a pure form of mind control.
[00:39:11.514 --> 00:39:14.396]  Everything is riding on being a member of Delta Force.
[00:39:15.433 --> 00:39:19.216]  And they go, okay, here's your final exam.
[00:39:19.236 --> 00:39:20.617]  This is a big trade secret.
[00:39:20.637 --> 00:39:21.378]  They don't want you to know.
[00:39:21.758 --> 00:39:22.999]  Here's the final exam.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.981]  Machiavelli's the prince.
[00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:29.044]  You've got three hours to read it and two hours after that to write an essay on it.
[00:39:30.025 --> 00:39:31.286]  And guess what happens?
[00:39:31.366 --> 00:39:43.296]  If you say, if you agree with Machiavelli, and, oh yeah, killing innocent people for the greater good is good, and manipulating, and if you grasp that Joseph Mingala ideal,
[00:39:45.074 --> 00:39:52.000]  The ideal pushed and personified by Mr. Bowers in 24, you know, all these conditioning mechanisms.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.463]  If you, oh, you have graduated, oh, you're one of us.
[00:39:56.323 --> 00:40:11.796]  But if you're the good guy, you know, the weak-minded good guy who could pass all the courses and do the, you know, the hundred pull-ups and stay awake for four days, you could do all that, but, oh, you just, oh, you washed out.
[00:40:11.896 --> 00:40:12.597]  Sorry!
[00:40:14.122 --> 00:40:16.023]  And at a lower level, it's the questionnaire.
[00:40:16.083 --> 00:40:17.803]  Will you fire on American citizens?
[00:40:18.343 --> 00:40:20.884]  During a total breakdown, when it's needed, of course.
[00:40:21.264 --> 00:40:22.364]  It's a pushy question.
[00:40:23.345 --> 00:40:24.225]  A leading question.
[00:40:25.025 --> 00:40:31.087]  And if you say yes, oh, you're the 24% who are enlightened.
[00:40:31.147 --> 00:40:32.147]  You're going to be promoted.
[00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:37.189]  As with the other 76%, we've got some nice vaccines for you.
[00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:39.869]  We've got some nice DU for you to breathe.
[00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:42.070]  We've got a nice combat zone for you.
[00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:53.418]  And you heard General Karpinski on talking about, oh yeah, they weren't allowed to, the troops couldn't have the armored vehicles because the generals and people had to have them to ride around inside the bases.
[00:40:53.458 --> 00:40:54.399]  They were so cowardly.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.200]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.962]  Rush Limbaugh says they've got plenty of armor.
[00:40:58.002 --> 00:40:58.642]  It's not true.
[00:40:59.002 --> 00:41:02.265]  So just don't believe all the troops writing letters home and the admissions.
[00:41:02.825 --> 00:41:05.588]  Just believe that big fat pill-popping beatnik.
[00:41:05.908 --> 00:41:08.310]  That big fat bucket of slime.
[00:41:09.736 --> 00:41:19.424]  Just feel good and suck your thumb and think that worshipping the government and having a bunch of power of pride stickers all over your car makes you a patriot.
[00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:21.066]  It doesn't make you a patriot.
[00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:26.150]  Having the courage to admit what we're facing makes you a patriot.
[00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.473]  All right, we're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes.
[00:41:29.493 --> 00:41:30.974]  Toll-free number to join us, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:31.054]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:38.855 --> 00:41:41.658]  Our guest doesn't join us for about 50 minutes.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.961]  And that's going to be Barry Hamish.
[00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:50.447]  To talk about, and he's written some of the biggest papers in Israel, radiating the children.
[00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:53.330]  That's just a side issue, but very important.
[00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.571]  I'm going to have him on about that subject.
[00:41:54.851 --> 00:41:56.733]  Also how they murdered Yishak Rabin.
[00:41:57.294 --> 00:41:58.635]  Who's really running Israel?
[00:42:00.397 --> 00:42:01.458]  The government actually...
[00:42:03.513 --> 00:42:06.116]  Wages war there against the Orthodox Jews, of course.
[00:42:06.196 --> 00:42:11.321]  They go around CPS grabbing their children, scooping them up, persecuting them, breaking up their families.
[00:42:12.122 --> 00:42:13.684]  You'll never hear that in our news.
[00:42:14.324 --> 00:42:18.428]  It's an actual hellhole, not just for the Palestinians, but for the Jews.
[00:42:19.429 --> 00:42:20.110]  And it's okay.
[00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.594]  A bunch of atheistic, Luciferian murderers run it.
[00:42:24.094 --> 00:42:26.677]  If you criticize them for killing Jews, you're anti-Semitic.
[00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:30.050]  So I'm against killing Jews.
[00:42:30.171 --> 00:42:30.931]  I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:42:30.971 --> 00:42:34.534]  So you've got to get your mind around the new double thing, folks.
[00:42:38.076 --> 00:42:39.618]  It's a tall order.
[00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:41.699]  Very tall.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.823]  Very tall order, but you can learn how to do it.
[00:42:48.744 --> 00:42:52.067]  Well, Myers has withdrawn her Supreme Court nomination.
[00:42:52.607 --> 00:42:54.829]  Big giver to Bill Clinton and Al Gore and
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.163]  Everybody else in the Democratic Party and openly anti-gun, the record's now showing.
[00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:09.428]  She was pro-abortion seven years ago in statements, but oh, now she's born again Christian.
[00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:13.470]  Yeah, they floated she's against abortion.
[00:43:13.831 --> 00:43:16.933]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I'll sell you on the moon, folks.
[00:43:17.853 --> 00:43:24.157]  And oh, it came out that she's basically left of Hillary Clinton, just like Roberts.
[00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:26.716]  It's like Gonzalez.
[00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:28.717]  Now it has come out.
[00:43:28.757 --> 00:43:31.119]  I'm sorry to have to announce to you CBS News.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.320]  Oh, it didn't.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.964]  They said, oh, it's not very well known, but he's sensible.
[00:43:37.984 --> 00:43:38.945]  He's for gun control.
[00:43:39.686 --> 00:43:40.867]  Oh, good.
[00:43:41.247 --> 00:43:42.228]  Oh, we're saved.
[00:43:43.509 --> 00:43:44.429]  And again, I'm liberal.
[00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:45.830]  I'm against gun control.
[00:43:46.211 --> 00:43:51.155]  I'm not for George W. I'm for Roberts, real American.
[00:43:52.756 --> 00:43:54.177]  A man we can trust.
[00:43:57.898 --> 00:44:02.061]  I mean, the guy literally lives on a Hollywood stage.
[00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.922]  It's like Bush and his fake ranch.
[00:44:03.962 --> 00:44:10.046]  His little cowboy playhouse or whatever.
[00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:14.729]  It's like one of those things you buy in the backyard for your kids.
[00:44:14.749 --> 00:44:18.212]  It's like a castle or a pirate ship or whatever.
[00:44:19.072 --> 00:44:21.114]  It's basically like the cowboy set.
[00:44:21.841 --> 00:44:24.123]  Out there for Bush to run around in a cowboy hat.
[00:44:24.483 --> 00:44:26.284]  He's admittedly scared to death of horses.
[00:44:26.424 --> 00:44:26.924]  That's admitted.
[00:44:26.944 --> 00:44:28.485]  He said to Fox, where are the horses?
[00:44:28.525 --> 00:44:30.526]  And Bush said, I'm afraid of them.
[00:44:30.847 --> 00:44:32.228]  I'm afraid of horses.
[00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:35.570]  But I sure know how to talk like this.
[00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.331]  Everybody likes me.
[00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:40.513]  By the way, that's not how Texans talk, folks.
[00:44:41.633 --> 00:44:45.576]  So, at least old-line Texans...
[00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.590]  You got all these new ones going around.
[00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.351]  You like to wear cowboy hats, and they try to talk more and more country.
[00:44:51.591 --> 00:44:52.671]  How you doing?
[00:44:52.931 --> 00:44:53.832]  I get really tired of it.
[00:44:53.852 --> 00:44:55.052]  All right, side issue.
[00:44:55.112 --> 00:44:56.092]  I'm all over the map today.
[00:44:56.452 --> 00:44:58.533]  We will be taking your calls in a minute at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:58.853 --> 00:45:02.194]  What do you think about this Myers thing?
[00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:08.955]  I'm sure whoever else they bring won't have a record that's publicly known, but as soon as you do some digging, you'll find out.
[00:45:08.975 --> 00:45:13.496]  You'll probably bring Zhang Ximing over here, former Chinese commie president.
[00:45:14.256 --> 00:45:15.957]  That'll probably be our new Supreme Court justice.
[00:45:15.977 --> 00:45:16.817]  I mean, I shouldn't joke.
[00:45:17.478 --> 00:45:22.860]  We've got Marcus Wolfe, the former Stasi chief, helping run Homeland Security and consult.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.661]  And Prima Kopp, former head of the KGB general.
[00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:30.682]  I mean, again, I'm living in a Twilight Zone world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:30.702 --> 00:45:32.523]  I mean, we really are living in a Twilight Zone.
[00:45:34.464 --> 00:45:45.047]  And President Bush on Thursday... Uh-oh, my point about Bush in the set was the same thing with Roberts and those adopted kids.
[00:45:48.499 --> 00:45:51.620]  Meyers withdraws Supreme Court nomination.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:46:02.844]  President Bush on Thursday accepted the withdrawal of Supreme Court nominee Harriet Meyers according to a statement from White House.
[00:46:03.905 --> 00:46:15.289]  In her letter to the President, Meyers said she was concerned that the confirmation process presents a burden for the White House and its staff and it is not in the best interest of the country.
[00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:27.433]  The White House said Myers had withdrawn over concerns that senators wanted documents of privileged discussions between the president and his top lawyer.
[00:46:27.453 --> 00:46:43.161]  It is clear that senators would not be satisfied until they gained access to internal documents concerning advice provided during her tenure at the White House, disclosures that would undermine a president's ability to receive candidate counsel.
[00:46:45.182 --> 00:46:47.163]  So that's just a reason to duck out, folks.
[00:46:48.402 --> 00:46:51.304]  And since when does Bush withdraw something because people don't like it?
[00:46:51.784 --> 00:46:55.326]  It's because there's a firestorm over as people learn more.
[00:46:55.386 --> 00:46:58.388]  But now we've got an anti-gun Chief Justice.
[00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:05.213]  It's just like Bush 41 appointing an anti-gunner, and Reagan, and just all of it.
[00:47:05.293 --> 00:47:06.413]  It's just never going to stop.
[00:47:07.954 --> 00:47:12.137]  And then we hear how good Scalia and Rehnquist and Thomas are.
[00:47:12.217 --> 00:47:13.298]  They're not good!
[00:47:15.942 --> 00:47:21.507]  I mean, Scalia will vote against land grabbing, but then one of the others will vote for it.
[00:47:21.567 --> 00:47:26.331]  I mean, it's just... They'll vote for asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:28.533]  They'll vote that you... I mean, I'm tired of it.
[00:47:29.294 --> 00:47:30.815]  I'm tired of the propaganda.
[00:47:30.855 --> 00:47:37.241]  I'm tired of hearing that the government's saving us and they're just so good.
[00:47:38.237 --> 00:47:40.439]  Everybody freaks out over these nominations.
[00:47:41.019 --> 00:47:43.341]  It doesn't matter who's in office at the presidential level.
[00:47:43.681 --> 00:47:48.045]  They're going to put pro-open border, anti-gun, pro-world government people in.
[00:47:48.345 --> 00:47:59.374]  Remember a few years ago where Republican appointees and Democratic appointees came out and said, oh yes, in a flurry of interviews, oh, we believe we should follow the orders of foreign courts.
[00:47:59.854 --> 00:48:02.557]  Oh, actually, the Supreme Court isn't the highest court in the land.
[00:48:02.637 --> 00:48:06.680]  Oh no, we follow the EU court and the UN court and African courts and
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:14.282]  And Chinese courts, and that's where we get our... Yeah, where you don't even have juries, or you don't have due process.
[00:48:14.602 --> 00:48:16.303]  Well, that's our precedent now.
[00:48:16.703 --> 00:48:19.183]  The precedent that they have, literally, in communist China.
[00:48:19.203 --> 00:48:22.664]  I mean, they actually cited African courts and Chinese courts.
[00:48:23.325 --> 00:48:25.005]  Again, twilight zone.
[00:48:27.583 --> 00:48:31.785]  I mean, the cops are already now... I'm now hearing that the Second Amendment is a privilege.
[00:48:31.906 --> 00:48:33.326]  It's like driving is a privilege.
[00:48:33.587 --> 00:48:38.129]  And just because they parrot it to themselves over and over again, they're told that, they actually start believing it.
[00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:39.730]  Well, let me give you the news.
[00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:52.117]  Almost 400 years ago, the first sheriff was set up in the United States.
[00:48:52.457 --> 00:48:54.699]  500 plus years ago, they had sheriffs in England.
[00:48:54.719 --> 00:48:56.680]  You know, the Sheriff of Nottingham.
[00:48:57.572 --> 00:49:03.978]  But the people would get together, mutually for their defense, because we're the boss.
[00:49:03.998 --> 00:49:04.659]  You understand that?
[00:49:04.739 --> 00:49:04.999]  We.
[00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:05.399]  We.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.160]  You understand?
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.241]  You're not the authority.
[00:49:07.421 --> 00:49:08.502]  You're not the official.
[00:49:08.542 --> 00:49:09.303]  You're not the boss.
[00:49:09.323 --> 00:49:09.803]  You understand?
[00:49:09.823 --> 00:49:12.105]  I know you don't like it, but you're going to hear it.
[00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:13.967]  You're not the boss.
[00:49:14.027 --> 00:49:15.188]  You're not the authority.
[00:49:15.569 --> 00:49:15.869]  I am.
[00:49:16.684 --> 00:49:18.745]  And when you take your uniform off, you're the boss.
[00:49:19.105 --> 00:49:21.625]  But when you've got that uniform on, you're not the boss.
[00:49:21.665 --> 00:49:22.326]  You understand?
[00:49:22.486 --> 00:49:23.046]  Listen to me.
[00:49:23.286 --> 00:49:23.826]  Listen to me.
[00:49:24.046 --> 00:49:24.806]  You're not the boss.
[00:49:24.826 --> 00:49:25.626]  You understand that?
[00:49:25.846 --> 00:49:37.510]  And taking my rights away doesn't take care of me like I'm some big kid who's in a playpen or something, and you've got to keep me from eating a choking hazard or something.
[00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:39.110]  You're not my mommy.
[00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:40.050]  You're not my daddy.
[00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.551]  This nanny state government is not friendly.
[00:49:43.698 --> 00:49:44.439]  No thank you.
[00:49:44.499 --> 00:49:46.220]  I don't want your genetically modified food.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.041]  No thank you.
[00:49:47.361 --> 00:49:49.964]  I don't care how many times you say Mercury's nutritious on the news.
[00:49:50.284 --> 00:49:50.984]  We know it's not.
[00:49:51.545 --> 00:49:59.191]  No wearing black masks and sneaking around at night, kicking in doors, looking for drugs your bosses shipped in to begin with is not a good thing.
[00:50:00.993 --> 00:50:03.495]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:04.076 --> 00:50:06.778]  The government's doubled its growth rate in the last five years.
[00:50:07.058 --> 00:50:08.379]  We're losing all our freedoms.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.701]  That's not good.
[00:50:09.981 --> 00:50:11.102]  That's not good for you.
[00:50:14.725 --> 00:50:18.006]  And so we set up the first sheriffs.
[00:50:18.166 --> 00:50:24.629]  And then sometimes you'd have a couple towns within a county, and so the city would get together and vote and hire a marshal.
[00:50:25.769 --> 00:50:41.896]  But the marshal, which is the root of the police chief, the marshal had to do what the county sheriff said, had to follow his rules of being a peace officer.
[00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.472]  And you know who the sheriff had to follow?
[00:50:44.773 --> 00:50:45.694]  The people!
[00:50:46.656 --> 00:50:47.837]  The people!
[00:50:48.218 --> 00:50:48.959]  That's right.
[00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.141]  We're the boss.
[00:50:50.802 --> 00:50:51.663]  I'm the authority.
[00:50:52.224 --> 00:50:52.785]  Not you.
[00:50:53.045 --> 00:50:54.327]  You understand that, Mac?
[00:50:54.788 --> 00:50:55.629]  You got it?
[00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.630]  Good!
[00:50:57.131 --> 00:50:58.233]  Come back and take some calls.
[00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:05.348]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:07.330]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:13.275]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.535 --> 00:51:18.819]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.

[00:51:23.423 --> 00:51:27.206]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.466 --> 00:51:32.030]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:38.412]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.472 --> 00:51:40.353]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:53:38.894 --> 00:53:39.175]  I think?
[00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:05.061]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.081 --> 00:54:08.964]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.147 --> 00:54:14.848]  Scott Hartman is running the show.
[00:54:14.868 --> 00:54:17.470]  His girlfriend's from Austin, Texas.
[00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:22.454]  He was reminding me about a story here locally that I'd forgotten about.
[00:54:22.514 --> 00:54:26.097]  Yeah, where the police union doesn't let them do background checks on the police.
[00:54:27.876 --> 00:54:34.261]  And the city manager had tried to get that done, but oh no, you don't do a background check on a god before we give them a job.
[00:54:34.702 --> 00:54:42.708]  And it has been confirmed in areas of the country that it's a written rule, unwritten to many others, that the police can't get hired if you have over 100 IQ.
[00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.571]  I mean, what's going on here?
[00:54:48.052 --> 00:54:48.933]  What's going on here?
[00:54:48.953 --> 00:54:54.638]  And I've got the Washington Times article where they're hiring aggravated felons who are illegal aliens.
[00:54:54.678 --> 00:54:57.260]  They instantly legalize them, let them out of prison,
[00:54:57.973 --> 00:54:59.394]  And let them join the military.
[00:54:59.414 --> 00:55:07.841]  So we're going to have not just a foreign military of foreigners, but they're going to be felons.
[00:55:08.022 --> 00:55:10.744]  So, I mean, the exact thing... Well, not exact.
[00:55:10.764 --> 00:55:13.987]  Hitler used Germans, but most of them were at criminal records.
[00:55:16.028 --> 00:55:17.389]  Stalin did the same thing.
[00:55:17.409 --> 00:55:18.670]  I guess that's good.
[00:55:18.731 --> 00:55:19.311]  That's freedom.
[00:55:20.332 --> 00:55:22.113]  Criminals being the police is freedom.
[00:55:23.995 --> 00:55:24.695]  We're going to...
[00:55:27.003 --> 00:55:28.284]  Take a few calls here.
[00:55:28.304 --> 00:55:30.645]  Toll-free number to join us.
[00:55:30.665 --> 00:55:31.286]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:31.306 --> 00:55:42.633]  And I think that tonight's showing of my new film, The Order of Death, 45 minutes long, it is excellent, folks.
[00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:43.414]  I'm really proud of it.
[00:55:43.654 --> 00:55:56.242]  The history of the New World Order, Skull and Bones, Satanic Connection, the new video that an employee of Bohemian Grove shot this year, Inside the Owl, up-close video of the effigy, a burn, the mock sacrifice...
[00:55:57.234 --> 00:56:02.296]  The tie-in to all the other big cults.
[00:56:02.736 --> 00:56:03.376]  You've got to see it.
[00:56:03.396 --> 00:56:05.857]  It's not even available yet on DVD or VHS.
[00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:13.339]  And then I'm going to show the new, cut-down, remastered version of Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the original film.
[00:56:14.239 --> 00:56:22.242]  Total run-time of both films, two hours, ten minutes, and I'll be there tonight, seven o'clock, at the Alamo Cinema on South Lamar.
[00:56:23.282 --> 00:56:23.402]  And...
[00:56:24.568 --> 00:56:26.668]  I believe online tickets have sold out.
[00:56:27.189 --> 00:56:27.929]  You might check.
[00:56:28.529 --> 00:56:30.629]  But as of last night, it was almost sold out.
[00:56:31.129 --> 00:56:39.951]  But what they do is, they only sell 200 tickets via online, and then they leave like 20 or 30 for walk-ups.
[00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:48.773]  So if you walk up or you're driving by today, you might try to... And then always 15, 20 people don't show up who buy tickets.
[00:56:49.588 --> 00:56:56.254]  So normally, we end up packing every seat with people that show up, and then they've got to wait and see if the seats don't fill, and they don't.
[00:56:56.274 --> 00:56:57.354]  There's usually a few seats.
[00:56:57.695 --> 00:56:59.296]  So really, nobody ever gets turned away.
[00:56:59.336 --> 00:57:01.318]  It seems to always work out just right.
[00:57:01.398 --> 00:57:03.099]  So I'll see you down there tonight, 7 o'clock.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.541]  Art in Washington, thank you for holding.
[00:57:05.581 --> 00:57:06.122]  Go ahead, Art.
[00:57:07.062 --> 00:57:07.323]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:07.343 --> 00:57:10.125]  I don't mean to change the subject on you, but I... There is no subject.
[00:57:10.185 --> 00:57:10.705]  It's freedom.
[00:57:11.146 --> 00:57:12.827]  Okay, I've been meaning to call about this.
[00:57:12.847 --> 00:57:13.828]  You know, my wife got ill...
[00:57:14.747 --> 00:57:15.207]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:57:39.452 --> 00:57:40.912]  We're going to have to put chips.
[00:57:40.973 --> 00:57:45.035]  We're going to have to get chips now because of all the fraud and the terrorism.
[00:57:45.375 --> 00:57:47.016]  It's of the Lord.
[00:57:47.456 --> 00:57:51.819]  Some of the pastors and preachers, they're great.
[00:57:52.039 --> 00:57:53.660]  They re-air a lot of those shows.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.240]  I'm going to hold you over.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.001]  This is important.
[00:57:56.501 --> 00:58:01.464]  I've actually read news articles where different prominent preachers have said, to prove you're with the Lord.
[00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.931]  You must take it.
[00:58:02.971 --> 00:58:04.331]  It's a sign of the Christ.
[00:58:04.371 --> 00:58:05.172]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:05.232 --> 00:58:07.634]  Oh, see, folks, that is end times.
[00:58:07.974 --> 00:58:09.775]  When the preachers are saying, take the chip.
[00:58:09.895 --> 00:58:13.737]  Oh, they're citing, you know, they're citing scripture after saying the crap about the chip.
[00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:20.682]  And besides the chip thing, you know, like the whole Louisiana thing, you know, I mean... Tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:20.762 --> 00:58:21.382]  Stay there, Art.
[00:58:21.562 --> 00:58:22.203]  No, I believe you.
[00:58:23.303 --> 00:58:25.965]  And we'll find out if you remember who it was or what show it was.
[00:58:26.365 --> 00:58:27.166]  I want a type of that.
[00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:32.893]  I mean, I got Andy Rooney saying we all need to be forced to take chips to prove who's good.
[00:58:32.913 --> 00:58:38.057]  Then I have that police chief on of Bergen County, and he said he'd force us to take chips.
[00:58:38.117 --> 00:58:39.178]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[00:58:41.339 --> 00:58:46.243]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.129 --> 00:58:58.770]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.431 --> 00:59:00.491]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.212 --> 00:59:02.333]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.973 --> 00:59:03.794]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:05.395]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.096 --> 00:59:10.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.299 --> 00:59:14.383]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.513 --> 00:59:28.542]  We've got Barry Hamish, writer for some of the biggest newspapers in Israel, joining us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:59:28.842 --> 00:59:34.787]  We'll talk about just exactly who is running Israel and some of the nightmare things they're involved in.
[00:59:34.807 --> 00:59:38.169]  We're talking about Myers withdrawing, think the good Lord above.
[00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:42.493]  We're going to be talking about a host of other really important issues.
[00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:44.164]  We're taking calls.
[00:59:44.224 --> 00:59:45.625]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:46.246 --> 00:59:50.489]  And I'm intrigued.
[00:59:50.529 --> 00:59:54.392]  We went to Art right before we ended the last hour.
[00:59:55.914 --> 00:59:59.076]  And his wife's been real ill, so she's got TBN on all the time.
[00:59:59.116 --> 01:00:00.597]  And TBN's got some great preachers on it.
[01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:04.000]  But a lot of them, I mean, are just pure evil, folks.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.203]  I mean, I was on vacation a few weeks ago for the weekend.
[01:00:07.953 --> 01:00:14.476]  And so late at night, I'd sit there and watch TBN, and one preacher would be great, the next one would be so evil, it'd blow your mind.
[01:00:16.897 --> 01:00:27.062]  But Art's saying that he, and I've read articles where preachers have said this, but I haven't seen it, where this preacher was saying, take the chip to prove you're loving and good, it'll stop the terrorists.
[01:00:28.483 --> 01:00:32.505]  They're already starting to say that soon Jesus will land in Israel.
[01:00:33.473 --> 01:00:35.274]  And that he will worship him at the temple?
[01:00:35.334 --> 01:00:37.516]  Folks, that's what the Antichrist does.
[01:00:37.836 --> 01:00:39.717]  I mean, this is 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:00:40.498 --> 01:00:41.879]  This is 1 plus 1.
[01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.341]  And, you know, regardless, let's say you don't even believe in God.
[01:00:45.701 --> 01:00:47.042]  Which I do, but let's say you don't.
[01:00:47.702 --> 01:00:50.284]  Still, these people know what the Bible says.
[01:00:50.524 --> 01:00:54.747]  So this means clearly they believe in the devil, and they're trying to fool people.
[01:00:55.588 --> 01:00:57.949]  They're following, you know, that script.
[01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.331]  So, Art, give us details.
[01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:00.531]  I mean...
[01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:02.410]  What preacher was it?
[01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.611]  What exactly did he say?
[01:01:04.271 --> 01:01:25.466]  Okay, well, Pacific Northwest Time, it was last night about, in my time, 8 o'clock, because I was walking through the living room and I heard one of them say, you know, something about the chip, and I said real loudly, I said, blankety-blank, no one's getting no chips in this house, and of course he said, you know, you just swore, and I said, I don't give a damn, you know.
[01:01:25.906 --> 01:01:30.429]  And besides that, though, when I really started listening was when, you know, Louisiana's
[01:01:30.993 --> 01:01:31.973]  New Orleans got flooded.
[01:01:32.794 --> 01:01:51.141]  Some preachers are talking about helping the people and how loving, and then some preachers, all they're talking about is how the Bible says that we have laws, and that's why they have a curfew and a martial law, and it's for the people's own good, and they're talking about diseases and this, and they're totally... You've got two different kinds of preachers, man.
[01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:54.662]  You've got some that are... I understand, sir, but let me just stop right there.
[01:01:54.862 --> 01:01:56.683]  Specifically, what show was it?
[01:01:58.171 --> 01:01:59.231]  I don't know the preacher's name.
[01:01:59.311 --> 01:02:00.952]  All I know is it was last night.
[01:02:01.212 --> 01:02:01.972]  What's he look like?
[01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:03.212]  Oh, you know what?
[01:02:03.872 --> 01:02:06.533]  I don't even want to try to give a description, but it was about 8 o'clock.
[01:02:06.553 --> 01:02:07.413]  Was it a white guy?
[01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:07.993]  A black guy?
[01:02:08.053 --> 01:02:08.793]  I'll tell you what I'll do.
[01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:09.733]  Yeah, it was a white guy.
[01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:12.394]  But I'll watch tonight and find out, you know, who it was.
[01:02:12.574 --> 01:02:14.474]  This was at 10 o'clock?
[01:02:14.654 --> 01:02:15.634]  No, my time.
[01:02:15.654 --> 01:02:17.375]  10 o'clock Central.
[01:02:17.395 --> 01:02:17.975]  No, 8 o'clock.
[01:02:18.755 --> 01:02:20.615]  I'm saying 10 o'clock Central.
[01:02:21.455 --> 01:02:23.456]  In your Pacific, that'd be 8 o'clock your time.
[01:02:23.636 --> 01:02:24.156]  Okay, yeah.
[01:02:24.216 --> 01:02:24.996]  Yeah, right about then.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.961]  And what specifically did he say?
[01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:38.522]  He said that because of all the fraud and, you know, I heard him talk about the fraud thing.
[01:02:38.882 --> 01:02:41.583]  I don't know if he was talking about the natural disasters or anything, too.
[01:02:41.603 --> 01:02:43.203]  To keep our identities safe?
[01:02:43.563 --> 01:02:52.465]  And then he just said, so, you know, it's going to maybe be good or there's going to come a time or something about, you know, everybody getting shipped.
[01:02:52.805 --> 01:02:54.205]  And that's all I had to hear.
[01:02:54.983 --> 01:02:58.606]  Well, I got Pat Robertson on tape going, the chip is at the mark of the beast.
[01:02:58.626 --> 01:03:00.347]  And he goes, I don't really think so.
[01:03:00.668 --> 01:03:00.948]  Yeah.
[01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:07.894]  But, I mean, that's different from going, just saying, oh, I think it's okay, to, oh, we need it, oh.
[01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:10.596]  It's like some of them are saying it's okay to wrestle down and...
[01:03:11.036 --> 01:03:15.740]  And take in elderly people that want to stay in their homes, even though there's a flood.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.120]  I appreciate the call, Art.
[01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:24.766]  Somebody who saw this could call in and tell us who it was or look in the schedule and tell me who was on TBN last night.
[01:03:24.786 --> 01:03:29.729]  I'll tell you who just radiates evil is that Crouch guy.
[01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.251]  Goodness gracious.
[01:03:32.652 --> 01:03:34.633]  How could anybody look at that guy?
[01:03:35.484 --> 01:03:38.067]  Just, just, just, he oozes slime.
[01:03:38.087 --> 01:03:46.135]  And then the stuff that comes out of his mouth, and that purple-haired wife of his, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:03:47.756 --> 01:03:49.038]  I know some of you probably like him.
[01:03:49.098 --> 01:03:50.299]  I don't know.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:51.981]  I guess.
[01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:57.895]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.135 --> 01:03:59.717]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:09.507]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.928 --> 01:04:14.112]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.312 --> 01:04:17.153]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:21.915]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:26.536]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.756 --> 01:04:33.978]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.239 --> 01:04:36.659]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:59.682 --> 01:06:02.404]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:02.844 --> 01:06:05.486]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:05.926 --> 01:06:12.389]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:58.291 --> 01:06:58.951]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.611 --> 01:07:00.692]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:02.512]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:03.953]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.713 --> 01:07:05.533]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.593 --> 01:07:10.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.455 --> 01:07:14.576]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.436 --> 01:07:21.938]  We got Barry Hamish coming on, joining us from Israel with a report on just a host of issues, including Israeli government.
[01:07:22.759 --> 01:07:27.340]  Radiating 100,000 Jewish children, killing the majority of them, and maiming the rest.
[01:07:28.679 --> 01:07:32.000]  Just what governments do best is horrible killing.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.080]  Let's give all our rights up to them.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:43.962]  And, of course, Mrs. Myers, Miss Myers, has withdrawn her bid to be a new Supreme Court Justice.
[01:07:46.683 --> 01:07:48.423]  And we're watching for the indictments.
[01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.924]  Will they be handed down or will nothing happen?
[01:07:51.044 --> 01:07:52.604]  They were supposed to come down two weeks ago.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.581]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:56.721]  Do you think they're going to be indicted?
[01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:57.541]  Who's going to be indicted?
[01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:59.122]  When is this going to take place?
[01:07:59.162 --> 01:07:59.862]  Does it even matter?
[01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:03.544]  We know Bush and his people are just puppets for big financial interests.
[01:08:03.564 --> 01:08:03.944]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:03.964 --> 01:08:04.044]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:06.025]  Jeff in New York, you're on the air.
[01:08:06.045 --> 01:08:06.485]  Welcome.
[01:08:06.505 --> 01:08:07.746]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:07.806]  Hi.
[01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:12.988]  Hey, on Washington Journal this morning, Lawrence Wilkerson, former Powell Chief of Staff, was on.
[01:08:23.692 --> 01:08:32.635]  And maybe one of your listeners has it on tape and can play it for us, but he mentioned how he was very nervous that we were about to go into martial law.
[01:08:34.096 --> 01:08:40.558]  And at the same time that he was describing his evidence for this, they cut in with the story about Harriet Myers.
[01:08:42.959 --> 01:08:44.140]  Oh, how convenient.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.722]  So the Powell chief deputy who says that Bush and Cheney have seized control of the government...
[01:08:51.849 --> 01:08:54.991]  He was on C-SPAN Washington Journal this morning?
[01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:55.791]  That's right.
[01:08:56.052 --> 01:08:57.052]  Who was he on with?
[01:08:58.433 --> 01:08:59.374]  He was by himself.
[01:09:01.355 --> 01:09:02.355]  I mean, he was being interviewed.
[01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:05.497]  He was being interviewed by one of the women, I can't remember her name.
[01:09:05.537 --> 01:09:06.578]  So it wasn't Henry Lamb?
[01:09:06.918 --> 01:09:08.199]  No, Brian Lamb, no.
[01:09:09.079 --> 01:09:10.120]  I know, you always do that.
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.781]  Henry Lamb's the anti-UN guy.
[01:09:12.121 --> 01:09:14.503]  Brian Lamb, I think... Brian Lamb's the guy on C-SPAN, yeah.
[01:09:14.523 --> 01:09:18.065]  I think he does Fridays, for the most part.
[01:09:18.525 --> 01:09:19.666]  Friday mornings on there.
[01:09:21.387 --> 01:09:21.587]  Yeah.
[01:09:23.244 --> 01:09:26.425]  So specifically, exactly, Jeff, I'm glad you called.
[01:09:26.445 --> 01:09:27.725]  Specifically, what did he say?
[01:09:28.345 --> 01:09:30.185]  I can only paraphrase.
[01:09:30.565 --> 01:09:39.187]  I caught just the middle and the end of the interview, and they didn't even want to talk to him about the subject of martial law.
[01:09:39.627 --> 01:09:43.368]  Maybe we'll put out the message to some of your other listeners, and maybe someone has it on tape.
[01:09:43.448 --> 01:09:45.008]  It's worked out like that before for us.
[01:09:46.548 --> 01:09:47.848]  I've got another story.
[01:09:48.148 --> 01:09:50.829]  My local CBS affiliate a few months ago
[01:09:51.698 --> 01:10:00.626]  I did a story out of Fort Drum, New York, where they were starting a project there to convert all the military uniforms to have Velcro patches.
[01:10:01.547 --> 01:10:05.751]  And I've started to see this on other military units outside of Fort Drum.
[01:10:06.332 --> 01:10:13.759]  One of the soldiers they interviewed pointed out how easy it was to take off your American flag patch if you're in an area that doesn't like Americans.
[01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:19.672]  I was thinking how easy it would be to pull it off and put on a UN insignia, or a NATO insignia, or whatever.
[01:10:19.692 --> 01:10:21.193]  No, no, no, that's the whole point, sir.
[01:10:21.233 --> 01:10:29.775]  That's why they have Velcro now, going to different commands, totally un-American, total global government, and that's why Michael News said no.
[01:10:31.335 --> 01:10:39.837]  So, you were watching Washington Journal, and they had Mr. Wilkerson on, who's really been bold, and...
[01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.416]  And he was talking about martial law.
[01:10:43.456 --> 01:10:48.861]  Well, that's what Ray McGovern's talking about, chief CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush 41.
[01:10:49.181 --> 01:10:52.083]  That's what Ron Paul is warning people about.
[01:10:53.104 --> 01:11:01.290]  To paraphrase Wilkerson, he said he was very fearful that the Bush administration was going to use martial law very soon.
[01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.852]  Well, yeah, martial law is the end of America.
[01:11:03.912 --> 01:11:06.174]  Martial law is getting an actual dictator.
[01:11:07.675 --> 01:11:08.836]  Yeah, we're very close.
[01:11:09.309 --> 01:11:13.012]  Alex, can I put a plug in for my public access TV show?
[01:11:13.232 --> 01:11:13.512]  Sure.
[01:11:14.013 --> 01:11:21.619]  It airs on Thursday afternoons in the Syracuse area on Time Warner Cable from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock p.m.
[01:11:21.699 --> 01:11:26.463]  It's called Expose and Defeat Tyranny, and I've been showing your videos for the past three months on there.
[01:11:27.723 --> 01:11:29.005]  Well, good.
[01:11:29.045 --> 01:11:30.466]  Tell us more about your show specifically.
[01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:31.006]  When is it on?
[01:11:31.026 --> 01:11:32.407]  4 p.m.
[01:11:32.467 --> 01:11:33.528]  to 6 p.m.
[01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:38.432]  on public access on Time Warner Cable in Syracuse area.
[01:11:38.956 --> 01:11:40.137]  Well, good job, my friend.
[01:11:40.817 --> 01:11:42.058]  You're doing a good job, Alex.
[01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.639]  Take care and keep it up.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:53.324]  Here's an article with Mr. Wilkerson's comments, and then there's been other aides to Bush 41 going public.
[01:11:54.525 --> 01:12:02.930]  Vice President Dick Cheney and a handful of others had hijacked the government's foreign policy apparatus, deciding in secret to carry out policies that had left the U.S.
[01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.751]  weaker and more isolated in the world.
[01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:20.511]  The top aide of former Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed last week in a scathing attack on the record of President George W. Bush, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, do me a favor, instant message my producer.
[01:12:21.972 --> 01:12:26.135]  I told her I wanted him on a week ago, but I haven't, I guess, beat that drum hard enough.
[01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:26.936]  We've been real busy.
[01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:32.139]  But I want Colonel Wilkerson on, and I've got a sneaking suspicion we can get him on real fast.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.701]  Sounds like he wants to talk.
[01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:56.479]  Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, Chief of Staff to Mr. Powell until last January, said, What I saw was a cabal between the Vice President of the United States, Richard Cheney, and the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, on critical issues that made decisions that the bureaucracy did not know were being made.
[01:12:57.759 --> 01:12:59.000]  I'd say so, like carrying out 9-11.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.300]  I'd say that's...
[01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:09.436]  Now it is paying the consequences of making these decisions in secret, but far more telling to me is that America is paying the consequences.
[01:13:10.736 --> 01:13:20.000]  Mr. Wilkerson said that such secret decision-making was responsible for mistakes such as the long refusal to engage North Korea or to back European efforts in Iran.
[01:13:21.801 --> 01:13:23.242]  And it just goes on and on, but...
[01:13:26.517 --> 01:13:30.940]  I would like to talk to Mr. Wilkerson, so we'll see if that happens.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.642]  We'll cover a couple other news items.
[01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:34.802]  What's that, Coach?
[01:13:36.403 --> 01:13:36.964]  Okay, sure.
[01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:38.024]  Great.
[01:13:39.385 --> 01:13:42.067]  We're working on trying to get some of those clips for you, folks.
[01:13:45.245 --> 01:13:49.286]  But look at this article, so they can track all the good little slaves in Nazi Germany.
[01:13:49.586 --> 01:13:53.127]  Can you imagine what the Nazis could have done with RFID in all your papers?
[01:13:53.748 --> 01:13:59.089]  Why, if you were walking down the street without your papers, they would instantly know it and instantly flag the police.
[01:13:59.589 --> 01:14:05.351]  Or the minute you got in your car, they'd know exactly where you went and how fast you drove and where you stopped.
[01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:07.773]  Oh, let's just trust the government.
[01:14:08.213 --> 01:14:09.574]  Our government, so what?
[01:14:09.734 --> 01:14:15.119]  Our government paid $3 billion to have 100,000 Jewish children microwaved by Israel.
[01:14:15.579 --> 01:14:17.621]  Let's just trust a government that would do that.
[01:14:18.141 --> 01:14:20.163]  And 100 other things just as bad or worse.
[01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:22.504]  That's the point.
[01:14:23.285 --> 01:14:26.368]  Last night I was talking to some individual at a restaurant.
[01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.468]  He came over and was talking to me.
[01:14:28.269 --> 01:14:30.511]  And he's like, Alex, I'm a computer programmer.
[01:14:31.992 --> 01:14:40.034]  And I, you know, do these backbone chips, you know, the chips that are inside the cars and inside the RFID and inside the RFID readers.
[01:14:40.514 --> 01:14:41.794]  You know, what do I have to hide?
[01:14:41.834 --> 01:14:42.495]  What's the big deal?
[01:14:42.615 --> 01:14:43.335]  I don't care.
[01:14:44.955 --> 01:14:46.456]  It's not that you're bad, sir.
[01:14:46.496 --> 01:14:47.536]  It's that they're bad.
[01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:56.578]  It's not that you don't have anything to hide, so you go, you know, I don't want my privacy, and so we have freedom in this country, you numbskull.
[01:14:57.418 --> 01:14:58.578]  And I actually told the guy that.
[01:14:58.598 --> 01:15:00.759]  He started arguing with me, and I just said, look, get away from me.
[01:15:01.867 --> 01:15:03.108]  I'm trying to eat here.
[01:15:03.168 --> 01:15:04.749]  I was nice enough to start talking to you.
[01:15:05.089 --> 01:15:06.070]  Just leave me alone.
[01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:07.811]  Get away from me.
[01:15:10.933 --> 01:15:14.036]  And the guy's got this whole elaborate world because that's his job.
[01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:15.937]  That's how he makes $100,000 a year.
[01:15:15.957 --> 01:15:16.818]  And don't worry.
[01:15:16.858 --> 01:15:19.760]  In six months, some Indian will have the job getting $30,000 a year.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.943]  He'll be calling, agreeing, asking for a job.
[01:15:24.223 --> 01:15:25.604]  Hey, you're right about all that.
[01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:27.565]  Can I come work for Infowars?
[01:15:28.646 --> 01:15:30.227]  We don't have two pennies to rub together.
[01:15:32.003 --> 01:15:32.823]  Oh, that's not true.
[01:15:33.324 --> 01:15:36.145]  But we could certainly be more capitalized and do more.
[01:15:37.565 --> 01:15:39.366]  Here's a more accurate statement.
[01:15:39.826 --> 01:15:45.489]  You know, it's just... I don't have time for it anymore.
[01:15:46.069 --> 01:15:48.970]  I'm just totally and completely sick of it all.
[01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:50.931]  Steve in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:15:50.971 --> 01:15:51.631]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:15:52.251 --> 01:15:53.252]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alan.
[01:15:53.652 --> 01:15:53.892]  Hi.
[01:15:54.632 --> 01:15:54.753]  Hi.
[01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:58.291]  I saw something on TV the other day.
[01:15:58.311 --> 01:16:03.755]  I don't watch much television, but I watch Hour 2 in the afternoons to try to catch up on the corporate news.
[01:16:06.256 --> 01:16:10.659]  And they're advertising for Lockheed Martin, securing your future.
[01:16:10.679 --> 01:16:15.102]  And I'm thinking to myself, what product do they offer the American public?
[01:16:15.402 --> 01:16:15.822]  They don't.
[01:16:15.882 --> 01:16:17.243]  It's a direct payoff.
[01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:32.802]  To their own subdivision there with the media, and those payments are made by Archer Daniels Midland, and those payments are made by Monsanto, and those payments are made by the defense contractors just to make sure everybody toes the line.
[01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:44.351]  But the advertising itself was really kind of creepy because they're going after young people and showing them that there's an opportunity to secure America's future in some high-tech way.
[01:16:47.685 --> 01:16:56.208]  Yeah, I have actually seen the ad.
[01:16:56.308 --> 01:16:57.428]  I tried to tape it one time.
[01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:57.928]  It was on.
[01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:04.830]  I scrambled and didn't get it recording yet on the cable box or on a VHS tape.
[01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:07.490]  If somebody could tape that and mail it to me, it'd be great.
[01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:10.531]  But no, you see, it's simple.
[01:17:11.111 --> 01:17:13.312]  The biggest part of our economy is prisons.
[01:17:14.016 --> 01:17:18.239]  The second biggest part of the economy is offense, or what they call defense, double thing.
[01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.341]  And they are openly greedy.
[01:17:22.081 --> 01:17:24.023]  And they've said, hey, we've taken over the rest of the world.
[01:17:24.043 --> 01:17:26.524]  We've overthrown dozens of other countries, over 50.
[01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:29.406]  Why not just take America over?
[01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:31.648]  And so that's what they're doing.
[01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:33.549]  And Lockheed runs the red light cameras.
[01:17:33.929 --> 01:17:37.752]  They put in the computers and the software for the cameras in the emergency management centers.
[01:17:38.527 --> 01:17:41.548]  And yeah, then they run a TV ad where young people don't worry.
[01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:42.789]  There are going to be jobs.
[01:17:42.869 --> 01:17:45.049]  It's going to be watching the other half of society.
[01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:47.770]  And see, that's how tyranny works long term.
[01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:49.771]  They're going to engineer it.
[01:17:51.012 --> 01:17:51.512]  It's simple.
[01:17:51.652 --> 01:17:53.893]  Where, oh, you want to get a...
[01:17:56.093 --> 01:17:57.514]  Scholarship to go to college.
[01:17:57.574 --> 01:18:02.057]  Well, the only scholarships we're offering are the lion's share are in Homeland Security.
[01:18:02.197 --> 01:18:03.358]  That's already starting to happen.
[01:18:03.998 --> 01:18:05.759]  Oh, or in Infrastructure Protection.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:21.810]  Oh, or in... So it's just that we're going to have tens of millions of police and spies and tattletales, as if there's not already enough of them, and they're going to have to find something to do and somebody to put in prison, so they're going to enforce all these new petty laws and all these... And it'll just be, where'd Bob go?
[01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:22.530]  He disappeared.
[01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:23.691]  He went in for re-education.
[01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:26.736]  I mean, is that what you're talking about, my friend?
[01:18:26.756 --> 01:18:27.376]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:28.897]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:18:30.518 --> 01:18:31.839]  Did that... Stay there.
[01:18:31.879 --> 01:18:32.660]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.942]  I mean, did that make you mad to just see how scary this was?
[01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:39.104]  I made it up to my wife and my kids and my friends.
[01:18:39.124 --> 01:18:40.024]  I told them all about it.
[01:18:40.044 --> 01:18:40.705]  I said, look at this.
[01:18:40.745 --> 01:18:43.747]  This is completely, you know... Well, stay there.
[01:18:43.767 --> 01:18:44.788]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:48.170]  And if you're on a cordless phone, try to get to a regular line.
[01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.952]  These cordless phones are god-awful.
[01:18:54.053 --> 01:18:54.834]  Attention drivers.
[01:18:55.154 --> 01:18:57.676]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:18:57.996 --> 01:19:01.298]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:19:01.618 --> 01:19:06.482]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents in fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:10.505]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[01:19:10.925 --> 01:19:11.986]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[01:19:12.286 --> 01:19:15.287]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[01:19:15.587 --> 01:19:16.247]  There is an answer.
[01:19:16.527 --> 01:19:22.650]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:29.973]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[01:19:30.313 --> 01:19:32.534]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:36.796]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protecta.

[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.801]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:57.122 --> 01:19:59.905]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:00.186 --> 01:20:04.331]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.751 --> 01:20:05.593]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.893 --> 01:20:10.479]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.959 --> 01:20:13.080]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:28.268]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:28.308 --> 01:20:35.372]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:20:42.355 --> 01:20:42.555]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:55.572 --> 01:20:56.733]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:57.133 --> 01:21:02.617]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:03.197 --> 01:21:03.697]  That's right.
[01:21:03.997 --> 01:21:06.299]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:06.859 --> 01:21:13.784]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:14.324 --> 01:21:15.405]  We're good to go.
[01:21:33.744 --> 01:21:34.004]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.655 --> 01:22:02.162]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:22:02.382 --> 01:22:04.203]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:22:04.423 --> 01:22:05.624]  That's one in four adults.
[01:22:05.945 --> 01:22:08.927]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it,
[01:22:09.247 --> 01:22:09.868]  We're good to go.
[01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:33.631]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:22:58.688 --> 01:23:15.295]  About seven years ago when nobody heard of biometrics and I was getting laughed at for saying they'd be in grocery stores just because I'd read their official plan for total control and taxation and tracking, you'd see Lockheed ads on every channel all the time.
[01:23:15.315 --> 01:23:16.576]  I watched a lot of TV back then.
[01:23:17.737 --> 01:23:20.238]  Every news show, every channel, just for years.
[01:23:21.523 --> 01:23:25.706]  Stopped running a few years ago, and it would just show this guy looking with pride.
[01:23:25.726 --> 01:23:30.248]  It was all shot in film, you know, high-quality cinematic value.
[01:23:31.249 --> 01:23:45.958]  A space shuttle lifting off at Cape Canaveral in Florida, and he points with pride with his finger, and the camera zooms around and zooms in on his finger, and then it biometrically scans and cuts to a scanner in a store.
[01:23:48.183 --> 01:23:52.487]  Now, again, folks, that's because they are selling the police state.
[01:23:53.367 --> 01:24:02.175]  And, of course, their customers aren't buying thumb scanners that watch TV any more than an ad for fighter bombers customers are buying that.
[01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:04.597]  It's to get you to buy into the mentality.
[01:24:05.317 --> 01:24:07.179]  So here are people that take our tax money.
[01:24:07.219 --> 01:24:08.420]  They get our tax money.
[01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:10.642]  They lobby our government.
[01:24:12.034 --> 01:24:15.537]  To give them even more tax money and to create wars so they get even more of that money.
[01:24:15.957 --> 01:24:17.418]  And they're propagandizing us.
[01:24:17.858 --> 01:24:20.240]  And they own the red light cameras giving you and I tickets.
[01:24:22.061 --> 01:24:25.944]  When they got caught doing it a few years ago and got sued over it, they just created a subsidiary.
[01:24:27.265 --> 01:24:33.990]  So, I mean, they're going to run our life and the military is going to tax us and they're getting rid of positive commentators and we're going to be a ruled people.
[01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:35.952]  We're going to be slaves.
[01:24:36.052 --> 01:24:37.613]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[01:24:38.979 --> 01:24:44.863]  And a lot of people inside tyranny will decide to join it and try to serve it so they can have power over other people.
[01:24:44.903 --> 01:24:48.366]  And a lot of petty tyrants are going to get to have their way with you.
[01:24:49.246 --> 01:24:50.987]  That's what's so horrible about tyranny.
[01:24:51.848 --> 01:25:04.577]  And it's just so sad this once great country is going to be such a high-tech slave grid, the likes of which the earth has never seen, unless we get the word out and say no and get the average yuppie out there to start caring about their freedom and start getting involved.
[01:25:05.498 --> 01:25:07.459]  Let's go back to Steve in Florida.
[01:25:08.214 --> 01:25:11.817]  Yeah, Alex, it's not just a lot to market.
[01:25:11.957 --> 01:25:12.998]  I've seen it from Boeing.
[01:25:13.078 --> 01:25:14.859]  I've seen it from the McDonnell Douglas Company.
[01:25:15.119 --> 01:25:18.482]  But I wanted to ask you real quick about the Diebold Company.
[01:25:18.562 --> 01:25:24.826]  I saw something on the net that said that they're going to be merging with the ATMs in the country.
[01:25:24.846 --> 01:25:29.630]  They're going to require a biometric identifier, something like a fingerprint or a
[01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:39.617]  Yeah, unfortunately, it's hard for me to make out exactly what you're saying, but did you say Diebold voting machines are going to be merging with ATM?
[01:25:39.657 --> 01:25:40.458]  I don't understand that.
[01:25:40.798 --> 01:25:42.199]  No.
[01:25:42.979 --> 01:25:43.219]  No.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.524]  Just the actual company, Diebold, I heard, is going to be going into all the ATMs around the country.
[01:25:50.804 --> 01:25:54.286]  Diebold already is the biggest maker of ATM automatic teller machines.
[01:25:54.767 --> 01:25:58.649]  Right, but they will be requiring you to put a fingerprint to get your own money.
[01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.730]  I think it's
[01:26:00.086 --> 01:26:06.568]  What gets under my skin is the RFID, the lack of... Well, where did you hear that they're going to be requiring that?
[01:26:07.308 --> 01:26:08.829]  I saw it on Net.
[01:26:09.029 --> 01:26:10.589]  I saw that they're doing that.
[01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:11.330]  I've got to let you go.
[01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:13.190]  Your phone's cutting out too bad.
[01:26:14.230 --> 01:26:15.151]  That is the plan.
[01:26:15.191 --> 01:26:21.573]  I mean, it's already going in grocery stores, already going in ATMs, and yes, they're going to make you, quote, because of identity theft.
[01:26:22.053 --> 01:26:25.614]  Well, a fraction, a tiny fraction of theft at ATMs...
[01:26:26.486 --> 01:26:29.146]  Do people actually have the card and go do it?
[01:26:29.187 --> 01:26:30.447]  That is a tiny fraction.
[01:26:31.767 --> 01:26:44.909]  Most of the theft is caused by large data transfers and sales between companies or company employees at these big credit card companies and banks stealing data and selling it.
[01:26:45.069 --> 01:26:45.849]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:26:45.869 --> 01:26:48.330]  You can read the crime statistic reports.
[01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:52.170]  But they make you think it's the internet purchase.
[01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:55.191]  They make you think it's the person at the 7-Eleven
[01:26:56.255 --> 01:26:57.396]  Who's stealing your credit card?
[01:26:57.696 --> 01:27:01.118]  And then, oh, we better surveil you to keep you safe from all of this.
[01:27:01.178 --> 01:27:03.699]  Again, it's problem, reaction, solution.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.420]  Who's up next here in order?
[01:27:07.342 --> 01:27:08.242]  Caleb in Texas.
[01:27:08.602 --> 01:27:09.563]  You're on the air, Caleb.
[01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:09.983]  Go ahead.
[01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:10.824]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:27:11.164 --> 01:27:13.025]  I'm a big fan, first-time caller.
[01:27:13.905 --> 01:27:20.869]  I was wondering if you've seen on the news lately these tech.survey roadblocks.
[01:27:21.049 --> 01:27:24.551]  What they do is they'll put up a roadblock like on Highway 183.
[01:27:26.585 --> 01:27:31.147]  And pull everybody over and give them a survey, see how TxDOT's doing.
[01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:35.208]  And it's just pure conditioning.
[01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:45.792]  Well, actually, their TxDOT documents that I remember seeing about five years ago, you see, they're trying to pass a law to have checkpoints in Texas, but it failed because it's illegal, folks.
[01:27:46.573 --> 01:27:49.734]  And so now they just have TxDOT out there with cops.
[01:27:51.138 --> 01:27:52.679]  Stopping you on your way.
[01:27:52.719 --> 01:27:54.700]  I've had friends who've been late to meetings.
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:28:00.322]  We almost didn't get a TV show on three weeks ago because Mike Hanson was stuck for an hour.
[01:28:00.722 --> 01:28:03.804]  Hey, if you don't want to take the survey, you've got to wait in line, pal.
[01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:08.446]  Even if you don't want to take the survey, you've got to sit there and wait for the people who do.
[01:28:08.686 --> 01:28:11.087]  But see, it's all about setting the precedent.
[01:28:11.407 --> 01:28:12.367]  We own the road.
[01:28:12.728 --> 01:28:14.228]  We go out on the major highway.
[01:28:14.548 --> 01:28:15.849]  We make you wait an hour.
[01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:17.209]  We're the boss.
[01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:18.210]  You're the slave.
[01:28:18.797 --> 01:28:20.478]  Get used to it, pal.
[01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:24.139]  It doesn't matter if you're late to work, Alex.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.641]  We'll all be working at Walmart here after a while anyway.
[01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:28.261]  They won't care.
[01:28:28.621 --> 01:28:29.362]  Well, exactly.
[01:28:29.402 --> 01:28:30.522]  But, I mean, here's the survey.
[01:28:30.842 --> 01:28:31.783]  How do you like the survey?
[01:28:32.103 --> 01:28:33.304]  I hate it, scumbag!
[01:28:33.944 --> 01:28:34.844]  Get over here.
[01:28:35.044 --> 01:28:40.507]  He's not treating the authority with proper... If you lick my boots, buddy, you get out of the car and you lick them!
[01:28:44.509 --> 01:28:45.449]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:47.410]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.321 --> 01:28:49.285]  We're good to go.
[01:28:56.568 --> 01:28:58.049]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[01:28:58.229 --> 01:29:02.152]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[01:29:02.432 --> 01:29:09.737]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste bill is something we all face every day.
[01:29:10.037 --> 01:29:11.939]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[01:29:12.259 --> 01:29:19.024]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[01:29:19.364 --> 01:29:22.226]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[01:29:22.506 --> 01:29:27.930]  Your nuke alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.

[01:29:50.906 --> 01:29:51.347]  Nuke Alert.
[01:29:51.647 --> 01:29:52.708]  Isn't your family worth it?

[01:30:10.998 --> 01:30:11.418]  We're good to go.

[01:30:55.103 --> 01:30:55.243]  I think?
[01:31:10.063 --> 01:31:10.523]  We're good to go.

[01:32:19.188 --> 01:32:25.555]  I'm fully aware of the fact that we've got loaded phone lines with a lot of callers, Bob, Peter, and many others holding that want to talk on air.
[01:32:25.575 --> 01:32:36.345]  So we'll get to your calls early in this interview, but I want to keep Mr. Hamish for the balance of the broadcast the next hour and 26 minutes, 15 seconds to be precise.
[01:32:37.406 --> 01:32:38.187]  Barry's written for
[01:32:39.173 --> 01:32:44.977]  In all the big newspapers, most of the big newspapers over in Israel, he's written for major journals and newspapers.
[01:32:45.417 --> 01:32:51.701]  Here in the United States, he's made documentary films, done speaking tours, exposed a lot of evil, and I commend him.
[01:32:53.682 --> 01:32:54.503]  That's what we do here.
[01:32:54.563 --> 01:33:02.488]  We expose the entire spectrum of the evildoers out there that George Bush loves to talk about all day, but of course he's one of them.
[01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:08.595]  And he's joining us today to talk about the 10th anniversary of Yishak Ravine's murder.
[01:33:08.935 --> 01:33:16.142]  But I want to crystallize and condense for people why he was killed, how he was killed, how the Bilderberg Group controls Israel.
[01:33:17.484 --> 01:33:20.186]  But then I wanted to go over some of the things he's written about.
[01:33:21.828 --> 01:33:27.053]  How the labor Zionist founders of Israel in the 50s took control.
[01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:28.705]  Billions of U.S.
[01:33:28.745 --> 01:33:44.872]  dollars, the equivalent of billions today, hundreds of millions a year, to radiate 100,000 Jewish children, and of course most of them died, many others are maimed, 35,000 times the safe level.
[01:33:44.892 --> 01:33:46.993]  Now we know they do that to some kids in the U.S.
[01:33:47.033 --> 01:33:52.115]  too, but it wasn't as... it was more scattered and secretive.
[01:33:52.695 --> 01:33:56.117]  Imagine your child goes on a field trip, oh, we're going to be checked out by the doctor,
[01:33:56.906 --> 01:33:59.087]  And your child dies two days later.
[01:33:59.167 --> 01:34:02.088]  I mean, imagine the evil of this.
[01:34:02.929 --> 01:34:04.709]  But that's what these governments do.
[01:34:04.749 --> 01:34:06.030]  That's why they can't be trusted.
[01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:09.951]  And a caller mentioned last caller about these checkpoints.
[01:34:09.971 --> 01:34:12.492]  It's all over the news, all over TV, all over the state.
[01:34:12.512 --> 01:34:14.393]  They just randomly shut down highways.
[01:34:14.873 --> 01:34:16.234]  I mean, literally for an hour, folks.
[01:34:16.254 --> 01:34:19.375]  You'll sit in traffic for 30 minutes, an hour, an hour and a half in some cases.
[01:34:19.795 --> 01:34:22.677]  We've almost not had TV shows because of it, because Mike got caught up in it.
[01:34:23.957 --> 01:34:25.838]  He made it like five minutes before the show started.
[01:34:27.726 --> 01:34:30.870]  And you pull through and they're like, you're going to answer our questions!
[01:34:31.591 --> 01:34:33.353]  And it's like, how do you like the roads?
[01:34:33.393 --> 01:34:34.134]  How do you like us?
[01:34:34.154 --> 01:34:36.637]  And it's all a big joke with cops looking in your car.
[01:34:38.385 --> 01:34:41.287]  That's how hungry they are to turn us into Nazi Germany.
[01:34:41.768 --> 01:34:42.809]  And we're very, very close.
[01:34:42.889 --> 01:34:47.032]  I mean, we're getting reports about high-level administration people talking about martial law.
[01:34:47.112 --> 01:34:48.093]  Bush is calling for it.
[01:34:48.153 --> 01:34:51.376]  Ron Paul says that they may have martial law and take over.
[01:34:51.676 --> 01:34:53.958]  I mean, they may declare themselves our supreme ruler.
[01:34:54.679 --> 01:34:57.381]  Bush may set off a nuke, whatever, and just take over.
[01:34:57.701 --> 01:34:58.562]  And he's just a puppet.
[01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:01.845]  So that's why it's so important to get films.
[01:35:02.125 --> 01:35:03.026]  We're about to go to Barry Hamish.
[01:35:04.847 --> 01:35:06.990]  Like my video, Martial Law.
[01:35:07.130 --> 01:35:08.832]  Yeah, I got a video out called Martial Law.
[01:35:08.852 --> 01:35:10.153]  See, I've been focused on this.
[01:35:11.115 --> 01:35:22.448]  And it covers the latest police state developments, the sound cannons, the hover blimps, the FEMA camps, citizens being put in them for the first hour, an hour on 9-11, how the globalists carried it out, why they carried it out, how they did it.
[01:35:24.164 --> 01:35:35.016]  And then we spent a full hour on the Nazi death cult and the Fool Society and these Luciferians and Schwarzenegger and what their ideology is and how it's all controlled.
[01:35:36.017 --> 01:35:37.759]  You need to have martial law.
[01:35:38.239 --> 01:35:44.026]  Please go to infowars.com and order it via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[01:35:45.228 --> 01:35:52.316]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv, where all 12 of my films, well, I guess now my new 13th film, The Order of Death, isn't even available yet on DVD.
[01:35:52.336 --> 01:35:56.020]  We haven't even been selling it yet, but it's on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:56.461 --> 01:36:02.327]  And you can watch them all online at Weekly TV Reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, 15 cents a day, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:04.642 --> 01:36:11.870]  Or you can call toll-free to get copies of the films and books and T-shirts and all the materials we carry, and that support is vital to the future of this broadcast.
[01:36:11.911 --> 01:36:12.471]  Don't forget that.
[01:36:12.491 --> 01:36:12.611]  At 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:13.072 --> 01:36:13.272]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:25.601 --> 01:36:36.084]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:36:36.604 --> 01:36:38.025]  Make great Christmas gifts.
[01:36:39.285 --> 01:36:40.385]  Make great Hanukkah gifts.
[01:36:40.445 --> 01:36:42.266]  Great gifts, period.
[01:36:42.306 --> 01:36:43.106]  Birthday presents.
[01:36:43.266 --> 01:36:43.746]  Whatever.
[01:36:43.786 --> 01:36:44.306]  Just get them.
[01:36:44.727 --> 01:36:46.007]  Make copies of them if you want.
[01:36:46.047 --> 01:36:46.447]  Please.
[01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:47.848]  Put them on AXS TV.
[01:36:48.368 --> 01:36:49.408]  Get the truth out.
[01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:58.162]  I know that locally I saw Barry Hamish's speech he gave in, what was it, Colorado, about how they killed Rabin a few years ago.
[01:36:58.202 --> 01:37:01.825]  One of my friends heard that locally on local access, so I got a chance to see it that way.
[01:37:02.565 --> 01:37:04.346]  This is how we get the word out.
[01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:05.787]  This is how we expose.
[01:37:05.827 --> 01:37:07.088]  It's all of us saying no.
[01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:10.550]  So please get the films.
[01:37:10.891 --> 01:37:14.933]  Barry Hamish, thank you so much for coming on with us, my friend, and thank you for all your courage.
[01:37:15.674 --> 01:37:17.795]  Yeah, it's been a few years, and I'm delighted.
[01:37:18.584 --> 01:37:20.205]  Well, we're delighted to have you on, sir.
[01:37:20.265 --> 01:37:21.945]  I admire your research.
[01:37:22.005 --> 01:37:26.287]  I've come to, unfortunately, the exact same conclusions in my research.
[01:37:27.228 --> 01:37:31.189]  Tell us about Barry Hamish, some of the websites where we can read some of your great writings.
[01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:35.431]  Of course, you live in and out of Israel.
[01:37:35.651 --> 01:37:40.313]  Give us the current situation there, and then let's go through your awakening.
[01:37:40.353 --> 01:37:42.234]  And then I want you to answer this question.
[01:37:42.934 --> 01:37:46.396]  Why do governments, period, all governments throughout history...
[01:37:47.253 --> 01:37:52.934]  At one time or another, just kill their people for no reason and engage in organized, bloodthirsty behavior?
[01:37:54.315 --> 01:37:56.475]  Oh, we're starting easy, are we?
[01:37:59.736 --> 01:38:11.479]  Okay, look, the website, my name, okay, www.BarryChamish.com B-A-R-R-Y-C-H-A-M-I-S-H.com That takes care of that.
[01:38:11.979 --> 01:38:16.040]  If you want to write me, email Chamish, that's my name,
[01:38:16.636 --> 01:38:30.544]  C-H-A-M-I-S-H dot, sorry, at NetVision, one word, N-E-T-V-I-S-I-O-N, NetVision dot N-E-T dot I-L, NetVision dot Net dot I-L.
[01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:32.024]  Okay, we got that over with.
[01:38:32.705 --> 01:38:33.926]  Are you in Israel right now?
[01:38:33.946 --> 01:38:34.706]  I forgot to ask.
[01:38:35.146 --> 01:38:36.627]  Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:39.108]  You said, how do we get a hold of you?
[01:38:39.168 --> 01:38:39.729]  I did that.
[01:38:40.449 --> 01:38:42.190]  Why do governments kill their people?
[01:38:43.191 --> 01:38:43.291]  Ugh.
[01:38:45.057 --> 01:38:45.458]  Really.
[01:38:46.138 --> 01:38:49.821]  Now, I'm about to do something complicated, okay?
[01:38:52.123 --> 01:38:54.165]  You mentioned Colorado.
[01:38:55.026 --> 01:39:01.551]  Yes, I gave a speech two and a half years ago in Colorado to the American Freedom Network.
[01:39:02.432 --> 01:39:04.914]  They recorded a CD and all that.
[01:39:05.514 --> 01:39:07.596]  It's called The Dirty Secrets of Oslo.
[01:39:07.616 --> 01:39:10.038]  Now, get this.
[01:39:10.699 --> 01:39:12.180]  We're going to try and do this today.
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:13.221]  I'm going to do my best.
[01:39:14.823 --> 01:39:15.744]  Oh, get ready.
[01:39:16.364 --> 01:39:19.206]  Shabtai see Labor Zionism and the Holocaust.
[01:39:20.007 --> 01:39:21.167]  And that's a big mouthful.
[01:39:23.489 --> 01:39:25.390]  Do you know what I'm talking about?
[01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:26.431]  Of course.
[01:39:27.491 --> 01:39:27.792]  Really?
[01:39:28.292 --> 01:39:29.833]  So where do you want to start?
[01:39:29.853 --> 01:39:36.157]  Do you want to talk about the Zionists helping the Holocaust along?
[01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:38.398]  I wouldn't say all the Zionists.
[01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.340]  No, no, but that dominant group.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.161]  The Labor Zionists, yes.
[01:39:43.058 --> 01:39:47.402]  To my great sorrow and sadness, should we do that?
[01:39:48.763 --> 01:39:49.944]  Sure, anything you want to talk about.
[01:39:50.004 --> 01:39:54.087]  But, I mean, first, out of the gates, let's talk about something that's totally documented.
[01:39:54.387 --> 01:40:03.675]  Let's talk about the ringworm children, because you've done a lot of reporting on that, and, of course, you've seen the film documenting, and it even aired on Israeli TV, folks.
[01:40:03.795 --> 01:40:09.920]  I mean, just to give people the idea of the type of bloodthirsty evil we're talking about.
[01:40:11.001 --> 01:40:11.341]  Yeah.
[01:40:11.681 --> 01:40:12.342]  Now, remember...
[01:40:13.355 --> 01:40:17.479]  Whatever I say, 99% of Israel knows nothing.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.481]  Keep that in mind.
[01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:21.302]  The Jewish people know nothing.
[01:40:22.904 --> 01:40:23.444]  Okay?
[01:40:23.504 --> 01:40:24.625]  This is not an apology.
[01:40:24.666 --> 01:40:25.266]  It's a fact.
[01:40:26.607 --> 01:40:33.113]  We've been manipulated deeply and wrongly and do not think it has anything to do with the Jewish people.
[01:40:33.834 --> 01:40:36.276]  It sure has a lot to do with something called Labor Zionism.
[01:40:37.777 --> 01:40:38.338]  Is that okay?
[01:40:39.093 --> 01:40:47.755]  I think that's extremely important to differentiate between the leaders and the people.
[01:40:48.735 --> 01:40:50.795]  Well, I mean, that's the way it is in every culture.
[01:40:51.515 --> 01:40:53.156]  But, I mean, let's get into it.
[01:40:53.176 --> 01:40:54.256]  Let's get into the ring.
[01:40:54.356 --> 01:40:55.236]  All right, get ready.
[01:40:56.996 --> 01:40:59.157]  The year is 1666.
[01:41:02.097 --> 01:41:03.637]  There's someone named Shabtai Tzvi.
[01:41:04.437 --> 01:41:06.938]  Shabtai Tzvi is the false messiah of the Jews.
[01:41:10.744 --> 01:41:13.706]  Imagine Judaism upside down.
[01:41:14.586 --> 01:41:21.609]  Imagine somebody proclaiming that he's the Messiah and half the Jewish world believe it.
[01:41:22.089 --> 01:41:22.730]  More than half.
[01:41:23.630 --> 01:41:26.752]  How that happens, later on, maybe.
[01:41:26.772 --> 01:41:29.293]  He obviously had help.
[01:41:29.853 --> 01:41:30.393]  Obviously.
[01:41:30.733 --> 01:41:36.376]  You cannot get to every single Jew from Mexico to Iran if you're just
[01:41:36.855 --> 01:41:39.156]  A little schmo in Gaza.
[01:41:40.357 --> 01:41:41.017]  He had help.
[01:41:41.537 --> 01:41:50.601]  Nonetheless, Shabtai Tzvi was the false messiah of the Jews in the 17th century, and he proclaimed an anti-Judaism.
[01:41:51.101 --> 01:41:53.762]  In other words, the Ten Commandments, the opposite is true.
[01:41:54.843 --> 01:41:56.403]  Do not kill, kill.
[01:41:56.823 --> 01:41:58.504]  Do not steal, steal.
[01:41:58.604 --> 01:42:01.385]  And especially, do not adulter, adulter.
[01:42:01.826 --> 01:42:04.907]  All this became the new...
[01:42:05.672 --> 01:42:07.153]  Ten Commandments of the Jews.
[01:42:08.374 --> 01:42:17.199]  And back in 1666, somehow or another, half the Jewish world accepted that evil became good.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:21.162]  Okay, now this is not me making it up.
[01:42:21.182 --> 01:42:22.403]  Believe it or not, it's actual.
[01:42:23.163 --> 01:42:23.844]  This is fact.
[01:42:24.584 --> 01:42:29.187]  The Jewish world in 1666 became anti-Jewish.
[01:42:30.768 --> 01:42:31.929]  There were reasons for this.
[01:42:32.129 --> 01:42:33.030]  It's not the time.
[01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:34.130]  I have books.
[01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:34.971]  We'll go into it.
[01:42:35.325 --> 01:42:36.326]  But that's a fact.
[01:42:37.947 --> 01:42:46.073]  On June 18, 1666, Shabtai Tzvi in Gaza declared himself the Messiah.
[01:42:46.954 --> 01:42:52.718]  And I am going to tell your Christian listeners, I don't believe it's an accident.
[01:42:53.279 --> 01:42:55.541]  June 18, of course, June is the 6th month.
[01:42:55.561 --> 01:42:57.422]  18 is 6 times 3.
[01:42:57.882 --> 01:43:00.404]  At 1666, we don't have to talk about.
[01:43:00.845 --> 01:43:01.765]  We understand that.
[01:43:02.886 --> 01:43:04.888]  He declared he was the Messiah of the Jews.
[01:43:05.818 --> 01:43:07.840]  And again, I'm going to say this.
[01:43:08.461 --> 01:43:12.224]  From Mexico to Peru, they rejoiced.
[01:43:12.264 --> 01:43:14.206]  Barry, your phone's cutting out a little better.
[01:43:14.687 --> 01:43:16.048]  Barry, are you on a cordless phone?
[01:43:17.509 --> 01:43:18.750]  Are we having trouble with the line?
[01:43:19.972 --> 01:43:21.433]  I'm just asking, is it a cordless phone?
[01:43:21.713 --> 01:43:22.414]  No, it's normal.
[01:43:23.318 --> 01:43:24.919]  It's just distorting a little bit.
[01:43:24.939 --> 01:43:29.461]  You might... I'm sorry to bring this... I just don't want... Talking too loud, I can move.
[01:43:29.761 --> 01:43:31.622]  Yeah, I would back off a little bit.
[01:43:32.142 --> 01:43:33.022]  All right, I'm backing.
[01:43:33.042 --> 01:43:33.623]  Is this better?
[01:43:33.723 --> 01:43:34.503]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:43:34.703 --> 01:43:35.383]  Please continue.
[01:43:36.024 --> 01:43:36.704]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:43:37.484 --> 01:43:37.845]  All right.
[01:43:37.865 --> 01:43:40.846]  This is a very important background.
[01:43:40.866 --> 01:43:47.869]  The Antichrist, as you would know him, and as we don't, but nonetheless, declared himself
[01:43:48.297 --> 01:43:50.158]  The Messiah of the Jews on June 18, 1666.
[01:43:50.778 --> 01:43:52.879]  Is that okay with you?
[01:43:53.919 --> 01:43:54.899]  Yes, please continue.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:55.940]  Oh, good.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:56.900]  All right.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:06.383]  Now, we're talking about a Judaism that's anti-the Torah, anti-what you would call the Old Testament, anti-religion, anti-morality.
[01:44:08.104 --> 01:44:11.985]  And the Jews accepted it as their new faith.
[01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:16.467]  The majority of Jews accepted this as their new faith.
[01:44:17.452 --> 01:44:18.473]  That's a new doctrine.
[01:44:19.914 --> 01:44:27.559]  Now, Shabtai Tzvi was taken by the Turks and he was forced to convert to Islam.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.460]  And he did.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.682]  And then most of the Jews abandoned him.
[01:44:32.422 --> 01:44:33.163]  But not all.
[01:44:34.684 --> 01:44:35.944]  There was a sect in Turkey.
[01:44:35.984 --> 01:44:36.965]  It's called the Donmeh.
[01:44:37.706 --> 01:44:46.992]  The Donmeh accepted the conversion as part of the great, shall we call it the great messianic,
[01:44:51.213 --> 01:44:56.457]  Okay, so this is the roots of Labor Zionism.
[01:44:57.398 --> 01:44:59.199]  That is also part of the Great Vision.
[01:45:01.501 --> 01:45:01.841]  Hello?
[01:45:02.541 --> 01:45:03.422]  Yes, yes, Barry.
[01:45:03.502 --> 01:45:04.062]  Oh, perfect.
[01:45:04.503 --> 01:45:05.644]  In other words, this is it.
[01:45:05.684 --> 01:45:11.408]  Shabtai Tzvi produced an anti-religion, an immorality.
[01:45:11.928 --> 01:45:14.330]  In other words, okay, let me give you an example.
[01:45:14.730 --> 01:45:16.231]  The Jewish holidays became...
[01:45:17.874 --> 01:45:19.195]  Excuses for orgies.
[01:45:19.775 --> 01:45:27.177]  The holiday of Purim, which celebrates liberation from Persia, became a reason to exchange wives.
[01:45:28.338 --> 01:45:33.539]  Hanukkah, another liberation holiday, became an excuse to exchange wives.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.300]  It became debauchery.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.861]  Judaism became debauchery.
[01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:42.922]  As theology throughout the Jewish world.
[01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:44.763]  This is a fact, by the way.
[01:45:45.859 --> 01:45:47.240]  We're not talking a fantasy.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.120]  It's been hidden from history.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:46:00.744]  It's been certainly, certainly... But Barry, in the interest of time, because we've got a lot to cover, can we accelerate up to this modern crew, and then we'll go back into the Holocaust?
[01:46:01.764 --> 01:46:03.325]  That's the whole point.
[01:46:03.905 --> 01:46:07.386]  Murder became not a sin anymore.
[01:46:08.026 --> 01:46:12.588]  Murder became, in Judaic terms, a mitzvah, a blessing.
[01:46:13.823 --> 01:46:16.324]  Everything in Judaism turned upside down.
[01:46:16.604 --> 01:46:19.785]  So what has the response been in Israel, Barry?
[01:46:19.805 --> 01:46:23.026]  What has the response been to the story of the radiation?
[01:46:23.486 --> 01:46:25.466]  Oh, you're really jumping.
[01:46:25.786 --> 01:46:29.327]  The radiation was an experiment of the Shabtaiim.
[01:46:29.727 --> 01:46:31.568]  Now listen, I'm going to use terminology.
[01:46:32.028 --> 01:46:33.228]  I have to start slow.
[01:46:33.268 --> 01:46:34.109]  There's no choice.
[01:46:35.449 --> 01:46:41.351]  I'm certain your readers and your listeners and so forth have never really understood the Sabbataim.
[01:46:41.831 --> 01:46:42.971]  And again, another term.
[01:46:43.436 --> 01:46:46.038]  Sabatain means followers of Shabtai Tzvi.
[01:46:46.919 --> 01:46:51.222]  I'm certain your listeners, most of them, have never heard this terminology.
[01:46:51.603 --> 01:46:54.125]  So I'm starting a bit slow, if that's okay with you.
[01:46:54.705 --> 01:46:59.129]  Yeah, I've heard you do a few other interviews, and I've also read it in the last few years.
[01:46:59.149 --> 01:47:01.110]  So I'm familiar with quite a bit of it myself.
[01:47:01.731 --> 01:47:04.553]  And the audience knows probably a little bit more than you think.
[01:47:04.853 --> 01:47:05.133]  Really?
[01:47:05.414 --> 01:47:10.798]  Yeah, I just want to specifically get into it, because we have the admitted Labor's Iron and Stone documents where they say,
[01:47:11.278 --> 01:47:18.301]  One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Europe, where they thought Hitler was good for driving the Jews out.
[01:47:18.662 --> 01:47:20.743]  All of that's important, and I'd like you to go over that.
[01:47:20.763 --> 01:47:26.285]  I'd also like to talk about radiating the 100,000 children, and I want to get into how they killed Yishak Rabin and why.
[01:47:27.206 --> 01:47:33.609]  Boy, we're taking in a lot, actually.
[01:47:34.409 --> 01:47:34.729]  All right.
[01:47:34.749 --> 01:47:38.631]  The fact of the matter is that Judaism became perverted.
[01:47:39.842 --> 01:47:45.928]  And it's not a simple background, but if you know it, I guess we can go into these things.
[01:47:47.290 --> 01:47:49.712]  Alright, the radiations, should we just jump?
[01:47:49.732 --> 01:47:51.414]  Yeah, let's just jump to this.
[01:47:53.278 --> 01:48:02.382]  The extension of this group 400 years ago now grows into the Labor Zionists who supported Hitler to try to get this state.
[01:48:02.522 --> 01:48:03.242]  Now they've got it.
[01:48:03.302 --> 01:48:03.922]  What do they do?
[01:48:03.942 --> 01:48:11.105]  I mean, this goes right to the heart of, and this is admitted, folks, right to the heart of how much they hate Jews.
[01:48:12.425 --> 01:48:19.088]  Boy, you don't want to go through Adam Weishaupt and the meeting with Mayor Amschel Rothschild?
[01:48:19.108 --> 01:48:20.508]  Sure, go through that if you'd like, yeah.
[01:48:20.809 --> 01:48:21.689]  Oh, please.
[01:48:22.279 --> 01:48:24.460]  No one's going to believe this if I just jump.
[01:48:25.141 --> 01:48:31.684]  Do you think anyone's going to believe that I'm raising an entire population of children if I don't give the background?
[01:48:31.844 --> 01:48:32.605]  Well, it's admitted.
[01:48:32.645 --> 01:48:34.546]  I mean, it's in major newspapers.
[01:48:34.606 --> 01:48:37.027]  Oh, it's admitted, all right.
[01:48:38.448 --> 01:48:42.230]  Well, admitted is, let's just put, it's been exposed.
[01:48:43.671 --> 01:48:47.453]  And for me in my life, it's not just a matter of news.
[01:48:48.153 --> 01:48:50.254]  I'll give you an example or two.
[01:48:50.754 --> 01:48:51.595]  My landlord's
[01:48:52.570 --> 01:48:55.753]  My landlord, a lovely lady, she was radiated.
[01:48:56.814 --> 01:48:58.575]  She's given me her own testimony.
[01:48:59.296 --> 01:49:13.108]  The lady at the supermarket who has very little hair, what happens when you radiate a person's head is their hair falls out and just never... Yeah, it kills the fast-growing cells.
[01:49:14.088 --> 01:49:14.329]  Yes.
[01:49:14.889 --> 01:49:18.312]  These are day-to-day life... These are facts in Israel.
[01:49:19.673 --> 01:49:20.053]  These are...
[01:49:21.004 --> 01:49:26.387]  Stay there, Barry Hamish, joining us from Israel.
[01:49:26.548 --> 01:49:32.792]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:49:32.972 --> 01:49:38.655]  And later, we're going to put the phones up so you can talk to Barry.
[01:49:47.859 --> 01:49:51.720]  Stay with us, got a full hour and nine minutes left in transmission.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:50:02.322]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.602 --> 01:50:07.343]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.563 --> 01:50:13.204]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.444 --> 01:50:17.986]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.187 --> 01:50:25.350]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:29.893]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.073 --> 01:50:32.574]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.814 --> 01:50:39.518]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:39.738 --> 01:50:40.759]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:40.779 --> 01:50:40.999]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.008 --> 01:51:00.235]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:00.375 --> 01:51:06.541]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.821 --> 01:51:15.210]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:22.517]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.818 --> 01:51:27.643]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.863 --> 01:51:33.268]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:36.652]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:37.012 --> 01:51:44.976]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.016 --> 01:51:45.596]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:52:03.924 --> 01:52:10.292]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:10.612 --> 01:52:11.273]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:31.471]  We're good to go.
[01:53:03.417 --> 01:53:17.325]  We're talking to Barry Shamish, and he's written for some of the biggest newspapers in Israel, and of course written for major publications here in the United States.
[01:53:17.365 --> 01:53:27.431]  And his research on the murder of Yishak Rabin, we could spend two hours just on that, but later we will give you a condensed overview of what really happened and some of the key pieces of evidence.
[01:53:28.081 --> 01:53:29.342]  And I know Barry's frustration.
[01:53:29.362 --> 01:53:37.327]  He wants to give you a million pieces of evidence, and I've read dozens and dozens and dozens of his articles over the years, and it just meshes with my information.
[01:53:37.627 --> 01:53:40.469]  So he wants to go over all of that, and I understand, but we do have time restraints.
[01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:50.154]  Let's hit a little bit more of the history, how this got set up between Rothschild and the globalists, and then the Illuminati, all of it, folks.
[01:53:50.195 --> 01:53:50.855]  And this is real.
[01:53:52.009 --> 01:53:59.313]  And then we'll get into the founding of Israel and what they did during the Holocaust and how they radiated the children.
[01:53:59.613 --> 01:54:04.215]  But jumping ahead, then we'll jump back, kind of like those movies where they jump forward and backwards.
[01:54:04.796 --> 01:54:08.357]  Let's finish up, though, since we got into radiating the children.
[01:54:08.377 --> 01:54:09.978]  They'd say, you're going to get an exam.
[01:54:09.998 --> 01:54:11.819]  You're going to get a fungus exam.
[01:54:11.859 --> 01:54:13.520]  You're going to a doctor's appointment.
[01:54:14.142 --> 01:54:15.643]  And then they would radiate them.
[01:54:16.083 --> 01:54:19.024]  And, of course, many of the children, tens of thousands, died.
[01:54:19.044 --> 01:54:23.685]  Thousands are still alive since this happened in the 50s and early 60s.
[01:54:24.206 --> 01:54:25.386]  And now it's come out.
[01:54:25.486 --> 01:54:28.947]  I mean, this just shows the type of evil we're dealing with.
[01:54:29.547 --> 01:54:30.588]  Barry, please continue.
[01:54:31.208 --> 01:54:31.548]  All right.
[01:54:31.788 --> 01:54:34.289]  Now, here's hoping that you hear me well now.
[01:54:34.489 --> 01:54:35.269]  Yes, you sound better.
[01:54:35.289 --> 01:54:35.510]  Thank you.
[01:54:36.090 --> 01:54:36.550]  Okay.
[01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:38.491]  Now, from the years 1949 to 1956, 100,000.
[01:54:42.987 --> 01:54:44.428]  By the way, the figures are more like 110,000.
[01:54:46.590 --> 01:55:00.922]  Children from the, they're called Sephardim, that means from the Middle East, were taken out of their classrooms and told that they were getting ringworm eradication treatment.
[01:55:02.523 --> 01:55:12.531]  What happened is that their heads were shaved, a marker was taken over their now bald skull
[01:55:14.154 --> 01:55:28.645]  The market divides the skull into about five or six separate areas and they were irradiated with x-rays, gamma rays, 35,000 times what's permitted today or was ever permitted.
[01:55:29.445 --> 01:55:33.869]  And they were given blasts of gamma rays through their brains.
[01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:36.551]  Over 110,000 young children from the ages of 3 to 11.
[01:55:41.631 --> 01:55:44.712]  Not a race exactly, a people.
[01:55:45.673 --> 01:55:52.776]  Mid-Eastern Jews were blasted with deadly doses of x-rays.
[01:55:53.716 --> 01:55:56.757]  The x-ray machines came from the United States, from the U.S.
[01:55:56.857 --> 01:55:57.137]  Army.
[01:55:57.838 --> 01:56:00.619]  There was a deal cut, an awful, horrible deal.
[01:56:01.259 --> 01:56:10.463]  Believe it or not, okay, I'm saying this, believe it or not, they wanted to see the effects of atomic radiation on one people.
[01:56:11.115 --> 01:56:22.437]  And they chose the Sephardic children of Israel to see what happens when you blast their brains with 35,000 times the permitted amount of gamma rays.
[01:56:22.477 --> 01:56:25.117]  Why is stuff like this always happening to Jews?
[01:56:25.137 --> 01:56:28.098]  It's just... Because of the Sabbataeans.
[01:56:28.798 --> 01:56:34.199]  Now this is, we started this show and I tried to explain to you that evil took over Judaism.
[01:56:35.559 --> 01:56:39.220]  And so few Jews understood
[01:56:39.915 --> 01:56:41.376]  That they had been infiltrated.
[01:56:41.416 --> 01:56:42.557]  They had been taken over.
[01:56:43.097 --> 01:56:49.321]  That their leadership became... Okay, I'm not kidding you when I say the word devil worshippers.
[01:56:49.681 --> 01:56:50.482]  I'm going to say it.
[01:56:50.822 --> 01:56:53.944]  Well, Barry, I've snuck into Bohemian Grove, skull and bones.
[01:56:53.964 --> 01:56:58.587]  Look, I know at the top, you find Zionists and Nazis, devil worshippers.
[01:56:58.967 --> 01:57:00.608]  That's all I've ever found in my research.
[01:57:00.908 --> 01:57:05.151]  Every time I kick down another door and get deeper, that's what you find behind every hidden door.
[01:57:06.031 --> 01:57:08.173]  Now, remember, there were two...
[01:57:08.948 --> 01:57:10.389]  Branches of Zionism.
[01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:13.231]  There was the Labor Zionists.
[01:57:13.411 --> 01:57:15.013]  These people founded Israel.
[01:57:15.773 --> 01:57:20.337]  And without a doubt, in 1933, they cut a deal with the Nazis.
[01:57:20.877 --> 01:57:22.538]  It's called the Transfer Agreement.
[01:57:22.879 --> 01:57:23.219]  Stay there.
[01:57:23.239 --> 01:57:24.260]  We're going to talk about it all.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.823]  We're going to let you go back through some of the history with Weishaupt and Rothschild.
[01:57:27.843 --> 01:57:29.164]  This is all very important.
[01:57:29.644 --> 01:57:30.525]  Then we'll take your calls.
[01:57:30.585 --> 01:57:32.246]  Folks, this is totally documented.
[01:57:34.181 --> 01:57:34.461]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:34.481 --> 01:57:34.862]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:50.834 --> 01:57:51.495]  Big Brother.
[01:57:52.155 --> 01:57:53.217]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.917 --> 01:57:55.058]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.699 --> 01:57:56.500]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.261 --> 01:57:58.142]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.162 --> 01:58:02.586]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:03.006 --> 01:58:07.091]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.786 --> 01:58:14.108]  I've done really deep research into the occult, into the New World Order.
[01:58:14.448 --> 01:58:15.589]  The facts, folks.
[01:58:15.609 --> 01:58:17.310]  You know that we do our research here.
[01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:23.913]  And one of the places I do research that meshes with my own... Again, I try to disprove my own research.
[01:58:24.533 --> 01:58:24.693]  And...
[01:58:27.246 --> 01:58:33.691]  You go somewhere like BarryShamish.com, it just meshes with all the independent research I've done independently with other facts.
[01:58:33.731 --> 01:58:37.353]  So, really good source of information, BarryShamish.com.
[01:58:37.593 --> 01:58:41.996]  Barry, B-A-R-Y, C-H-A-N-I-S-H.
[01:58:42.216 --> 01:58:49.141]  And we have a link to his website up on Infowars.com and a link to some of the great articles he's written.
[01:58:49.161 --> 01:58:50.442]  And, you know, it's kind of my fault.
[01:58:50.462 --> 01:58:51.442]  We are jumping around here.
[01:58:51.462 --> 01:58:53.284]  In about 30 minutes, we will take your calls.
[01:58:53.844 --> 01:58:56.686]  We've got people holding, but it's going to take a while to go over all this.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:17.088]  We've got a quick break coming up here in a second, but the group hijacking Judaism and basically doing a lot of evil things and making deals with the Nazis, radiating Jewish children, working with the U.S.
[01:59:17.128 --> 01:59:17.568]  government.
[01:59:17.728 --> 01:59:18.929]  Think how evil our government is.
[01:59:18.949 --> 01:59:20.309]  We're not just talking about Israel here.
[01:59:20.669 --> 01:59:26.592]  Our government wanted to test and radiate 110,000 people, so okay, we'll make a deal with Israel to do it to Jewish children.
[01:59:27.409 --> 01:59:28.670]  Running the country.
[01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:29.211]  My goodness, um...
[01:59:55.063 --> 01:59:57.484]  Look, I have a sense of humor and it keeps me alive.
[01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:59.404]  But they're running the place.
[02:00:00.544 --> 02:00:02.845]  Keep in mind that you take a Sharon.
[02:00:02.865 --> 02:00:05.045]  The Israeli people go to elections.
[02:00:05.105 --> 02:00:09.226]  They think they're electing a guy who's going to save them from all this.
[02:00:10.286 --> 02:00:13.727]  And in fact, he is thoroughly and completely corrupted.
[02:00:14.267 --> 02:00:17.947]  Now, I don't have to explain to your listeners what the Council of Foreign Relations is.
[02:00:19.248 --> 02:00:21.248]  But Israelis, they know nothing.
[02:00:21.775 --> 02:00:22.255]  And I take the dates.
[02:00:50.965 --> 02:00:55.808]  I take the places, and I take the people, and it all fits like a glove.
[02:00:56.768 --> 02:00:58.389]  And, well, what can I tell you?
[02:00:58.409 --> 02:01:00.230]  I've written these books for the last ten years.
[02:01:00.931 --> 02:01:04.573]  Honest to goodness, I have four books in Hebrew, and I have six in English.
[02:01:05.073 --> 02:01:07.794]  Nothing, nothing I predicted went wrong.
[02:01:08.315 --> 02:01:09.716]  Well, Mary, I've got to say this, though.
[02:01:09.756 --> 02:01:14.098]  It seems like not just Jews, but everybody seems to be starting to wake up.
[02:01:14.118 --> 02:01:15.719]  I mean, aren't you seeing a massive awakening?
[02:01:18.075 --> 02:01:19.256]  I don't care about everybody.
[02:01:19.676 --> 02:01:21.258]  This country of mine is doomed.
[02:01:21.718 --> 02:01:25.221]  If we don't smarten up really, really quickly, we're not going to exist.
[02:01:26.582 --> 02:01:32.127]  Now, again, we talked about the radiation without putting it in perspective.
[02:01:33.047 --> 02:01:40.453]  And I'm a little worried about your listeners again, because the argument I give is not a complicated one.
[02:01:40.854 --> 02:01:41.895]  It actually makes sense.
[02:01:41.975 --> 02:01:44.797]  It's just a new reality, certainly for the Jews.
[02:01:46.368 --> 02:01:56.133]  The Jews believe that there was a Holocaust all through Europe, that anti-Semitism went nuts, and without Israel we'd have no refuge.
[02:01:56.634 --> 02:01:58.735]  That's the basic argument of the Jews.
[02:01:59.155 --> 02:02:03.838]  The fact of the matter is there would not have been a Holocaust without the labor Zionists.
[02:02:04.338 --> 02:02:05.238]  It wouldn't have happened.
[02:02:05.959 --> 02:02:14.684]  And we would have saved the Jews, and the world would have intervened, and there would not have been six million missing Jews without labor Zionism.
[02:02:15.225 --> 02:02:17.486]  But you have to take the details now.
[02:02:18.006 --> 02:02:20.468]  Again, these are very, very broad statements.
[02:02:21.148 --> 02:02:23.229]  Now, may I go a little backwards?
[02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:24.230]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:25.090]  You do whatever you want.
[02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:27.151]  I mean, you've got the floor, my friend.
[02:02:27.191 --> 02:02:27.932]  You don't have to ask for that.
[02:02:27.952 --> 02:02:29.352]  Oh, we've rushed into the ringworms.
[02:02:29.372 --> 02:02:30.473]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:31.434 --> 02:02:32.374]  Well, we're going to go to break.
[02:02:32.394 --> 02:02:33.014]  We're going to go to break.
[02:02:33.034 --> 02:02:35.196]  I just want people to realize the level of evil we're talking about.
[02:02:35.216 --> 02:02:36.936]  That's just one of these people's crimes.
[02:02:37.877 --> 02:02:40.838]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, and we're talking to Barry Hamish.
[02:02:42.019 --> 02:02:42.499]  Stay with us.
[02:02:42.519 --> 02:02:43.600]  Your calls are coming up as well.
[02:02:47.543 --> 02:02:50.406]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.666 --> 02:02:51.347]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:51.447 --> 02:02:52.228]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.568 --> 02:02:57.273]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.593 --> 02:03:04.340]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:06.622]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.842 --> 02:03:09.684]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.784 --> 02:03:14.427]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.648 --> 02:03:19.071]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:19.291 --> 02:03:26.496]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.757 --> 02:03:29.198]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:54.066 --> 02:04:59.090]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:59.390 --> 02:05:07.296]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:07.457 --> 02:05:14.522]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:14.722 --> 02:05:15.923]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:16.083 --> 02:05:19.465]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:19.525 --> 02:05:22.206]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:05:36.335 --> 02:05:41.119]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:41.399 --> 02:05:43.180]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.345 --> 02:06:03.408]  Alright, a lot of news, a lot of information to cover.
[02:06:03.448 --> 02:06:05.710]  We've got a continual indictment watch going.
[02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:09.893]  If indictments get handed down, we'll immediately let you know who got indicted.
[02:06:10.794 --> 02:06:17.179]  Myers is withdrawn because it was discovered that she was left of Hillary Clinton, literally, and I'm not joking about that.
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:24.725]  We are talking to Barry Hamish, and he's just a great researcher and writer.
[02:06:24.745 --> 02:06:27.027]  He's written some of the biggest newspapers in Israel.
[02:06:28.542 --> 02:06:30.524]  And we were just talking during the break, Barry.
[02:06:30.544 --> 02:06:32.726]  You've written quite a few books, made some powerful videos.
[02:06:32.746 --> 02:06:33.947]  We'll tell folks about those later.
[02:06:34.307 --> 02:06:38.470]  And I said, hey, do you get threatened over all of this being in Israel?
[02:06:38.511 --> 02:06:39.431]  That was one question.
[02:06:39.451 --> 02:06:46.097]  And the second question was, are you waking a lot of Jews up in Israel to how they're being controlled?
[02:06:46.657 --> 02:06:48.539]  And please give us those answers.
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:53.163]  This is the 10th anniversary of the Rabin assassination.
[02:06:53.783 --> 02:06:55.685]  For the last two days, I've been on phone.
[02:06:56.252 --> 02:07:14.339]  With the major newspapers, because, well, all the polls of the last four years have proven that most, and I mean a big most, 70% plus, believe me, and my book, Humor to Yitzhak Rabin, over the government.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:25.984]  We have between 70% and 79% of Israelis, according to all polls, believe that my book, Humor to Yitzhak Rabin, tells the truth and the government is lying.
[02:07:26.608 --> 02:07:30.251]  In other words, the person who is sitting in prison didn't do the killing.
[02:07:31.591 --> 02:07:34.754]  The killing was done by the... It's called the Shabak.
[02:07:34.814 --> 02:07:36.455]  It's our equivalent of your FBI.
[02:07:36.495 --> 02:07:39.537]  Yeah, I pronounced it wrong then.
[02:07:39.597 --> 02:07:40.397]  I pronounced it wrong.
[02:07:40.598 --> 02:07:41.478]  It's not Shin Bet.
[02:07:42.319 --> 02:07:43.459]  Well, yeah, that's fine, too.
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.641]  Shin Bet and Shabak are the same thing.
[02:07:45.921 --> 02:07:46.542]  Okay.
[02:07:47.122 --> 02:07:50.384]  The personal bodyguard of Yitzhak Rabin shot him.
[02:07:51.465 --> 02:07:52.806]  Well, it's just like Ronald Reagan.
[02:07:55.504 --> 02:07:57.364]  It's the same murder.
[02:07:57.704 --> 02:07:58.905]  Yeah.
[02:07:59.265 --> 02:07:59.785]  Exactly.
[02:07:59.865 --> 02:08:00.445]  It really is.
[02:08:01.165 --> 02:08:02.225]  Remarkable parallels.
[02:08:02.685 --> 02:08:08.686]  But the person, the final link on the chain of command is Shimon Peres.
[02:08:09.186 --> 02:08:14.447]  Shimon Peres, the head of the Labor Party today, ordered the murder of Yitzhak Rabin.
[02:08:15.027 --> 02:08:18.708]  And there were many reasons, but one, he hated him.
[02:08:19.188 --> 02:08:21.028]  Let's begin with the personal.
[02:08:21.449 --> 02:08:23.069]  He hated Yitzhak Rabin.
[02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.909]  And then...
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:31.827]  Yitzhak Rabin tried to take us out of this awful, awful so-called peace process that's tearing Israel to bits.
[02:08:32.768 --> 02:08:40.696]  And that gave Peres the authority, the international authority, to murder Rabin.
[02:08:41.096 --> 02:08:47.242]  And the final cooperation and the order came from France and the Bilderberg Group and the Vatican.
[02:08:47.662 --> 02:08:49.044]  They all killed Yitzhak Rabin.
[02:08:50.252 --> 02:08:55.676]  And my books, by the way, trace every name and every date and how it was done.
[02:08:55.996 --> 02:09:00.819]  Now, the Vatican itself, according to your research, has some of these same groups infiltrating it, right?
[02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:02.421]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:09:03.741 --> 02:09:06.844]  Well, you paint a broad stroke, and let's go to it.
[02:09:07.684 --> 02:09:12.568]  Poor little Israel is being taken over by all kinds of groups.
[02:09:12.888 --> 02:09:14.589]  The Vatican wants Jerusalem back.
[02:09:14.609 --> 02:09:17.592]  We're talking the Crusades again.
[02:09:18.274 --> 02:09:22.015]  We're talking crusaders, but they don't need Knights Templar anymore.
[02:09:22.675 --> 02:09:40.739]  They have enough traitors within Israel, beginning with Shimon Peres, who is the head of the Labor Party, which of course means he's head of the opposition, but far more, that they can actually take over Israel and Jerusalem just by employing our idealistic young Israeli lefts.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.000]  They can actually do it from within.
[02:09:43.644 --> 02:09:49.607]  And we have got some very serious problems of infiltration within... Well, let's go back to the labor Zionism.
[02:09:49.647 --> 02:09:51.228]  Let's go back to the point that we were at.
[02:09:51.248 --> 02:09:54.769]  I mean, I was asking the question, can you repeat what you told me about getting threats?
[02:09:55.930 --> 02:09:57.250]  Oh, I have my period.
[02:09:58.051 --> 02:10:03.954]  Now it's... Our leaders have discovered that it's far, far better to ignore me.
[02:10:04.394 --> 02:10:06.915]  I'm completely embargoed in the media.
[02:10:07.375 --> 02:10:08.015]  Completely.
[02:10:08.456 --> 02:10:11.117]  I'll bet you I've been invited to 20 TV shows
[02:10:11.916 --> 02:10:15.559]  Who have canceled me the next day or within two hours sometimes.
[02:10:16.699 --> 02:10:18.020]  So that's better for them.
[02:10:18.401 --> 02:10:26.306]  It's better to keep me unknown than to give me a forum and let me explain what I know.
[02:10:26.326 --> 02:10:30.649]  The problem is when I get a forum, I bring evidence.
[02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:35.532]  And the evidence is really indisputable.
[02:10:35.552 --> 02:10:40.616]  It comes from as high as the Israeli police laboratories.
[02:10:41.336 --> 02:10:43.977]  I bring forensic and ballistic evidence.
[02:10:44.457 --> 02:10:45.497]  I don't just talk.
[02:10:46.537 --> 02:10:48.357]  On this show, we're jumping around a little bit.
[02:10:48.777 --> 02:10:52.878]  But when I go on Israeli TV, I pull up pictures and documents.
[02:10:53.258 --> 02:11:00.539]  Okay, let's say... I've given my lecture, Humor to Yitzhak Rabin, at least 500 times in this country.
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:03.380]  Very, very few people leave with any doubts.
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.180]  So I have a strategy.
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:06.440]  I think I can beat them.
[02:11:08.021 --> 02:11:09.641]  Well, this is the 10th anniversary...
[02:11:10.091 --> 02:11:12.053]  I think it's going to cleanse our nation and make us stronger.
[02:11:12.073 --> 02:11:12.453]  I believe that.
[02:11:12.473 --> 02:11:14.876]  But the utter, complete rot that took over Judaism...
[02:11:33.101 --> 02:11:34.402]  It simply has to go.
[02:11:34.763 --> 02:11:35.463]  It has to go.
[02:11:35.683 --> 02:11:45.873]  Well, Barry, let's go back then, and you said you wanted to go back in time, but treat this like a TV show or something where we've got limited time here to cover all this.
[02:11:45.933 --> 02:11:47.214]  Oh, I'm doing my best for you.
[02:11:47.274 --> 02:11:48.035]  No, no, you're doing a good job.
[02:11:48.055 --> 02:11:49.016]  I'm wrapping it every which way.
[02:11:49.036 --> 02:11:49.696]  No, you're doing a good job.
[02:11:49.716 --> 02:11:51.418]  But let's try to encapsulate this.
[02:11:52.058 --> 02:11:52.699]  From your research.
[02:11:52.739 --> 02:12:06.490]  Let's go back then and talk about Rothschild and talk about the Bank of England and talk about all these moves and Adam Weishaupt and then let's bring that up then to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and the rest of it.
[02:12:07.331 --> 02:12:08.712]  All right.
[02:12:08.792 --> 02:12:11.935]  Now again, we remember Shabtai Tzvi.
[02:12:12.375 --> 02:12:13.076]  We remember 1666.
[02:12:14.713 --> 02:12:17.194]  We remember he declared himself Messiah of the Jews.
[02:12:17.654 --> 02:12:22.415]  Now we have to go forward almost a century to someone named Jaco Frank.
[02:12:22.976 --> 02:12:26.857]  Jaco Frank was a follower of Shabtai Tzvi in Poland.
[02:12:27.277 --> 02:12:29.358]  He kind of deal with the Catholic Church.
[02:12:29.898 --> 02:12:38.981]  He brought 5,000 Jews for conversion to Catholicism, but they would secretly be following Shabtai Tzvi or Sabbataianism.
[02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:41.511]  Now he's dead poor.
[02:12:41.971 --> 02:12:43.012]  The year is 1784.
[02:12:43.132 --> 02:12:46.875]  He hasn't got a penny to his name.
[02:12:47.795 --> 02:12:54.720]  Now suddenly he goes to Frankfurt, Germany, 1785, and becomes extremely wealthy.
[02:12:55.641 --> 02:13:00.104]  Now 1785 is the turnaround date for Judaism.
[02:13:00.685 --> 02:13:09.331]  That's when its leadership became thoroughly infiltrated by, well, okay, Luciferianism, whatever you want to call it,
[02:13:09.759 --> 02:13:11.360]  I call it Sabbataianism.
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:13.400]  Again, Shabtai Tzvi.
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:15.321]  Same source.
[02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:20.022]  There was a meeting in Frankfurt, Germany in 1785 between three people.
[02:13:20.842 --> 02:13:22.183]  One is Adam Weishaupt.
[02:13:22.863 --> 02:13:27.625]  Adam Weishaupt was the founder, or at least they say he was the founder of the Illuminati.
[02:13:28.085 --> 02:13:32.126]  He may have been second, third, or the mere spokesman.
[02:13:32.666 --> 02:13:38.608]  But 1785, Adam Weishaupt meets Jakob Frank.
[02:13:39.361 --> 02:13:39.741]  Okay?
[02:13:39.801 --> 02:13:41.142]  It's called Frankism.
[02:13:42.023 --> 02:13:45.765]  It is the European branch of Sabbateanism.
[02:13:46.746 --> 02:13:47.607]  Jakob Frank.
[02:13:48.387 --> 02:13:48.927]  Okay?
[02:13:49.648 --> 02:13:49.808]  One.
[02:13:50.368 --> 02:13:50.709]  Two.
[02:13:51.449 --> 02:13:56.653]  We have Adam Weishaupt and then the big one, Mayor Amschel Rothschild.
[02:13:57.513 --> 02:14:00.355]  They meet in Frankfurt, Germany.
[02:14:01.556 --> 02:14:03.978]  There are three agendas going on here.
[02:14:04.798 --> 02:14:04.958]  One.
[02:14:06.199 --> 02:14:07.040]  Adam Weishaupt.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:08.981]  He is representing the Vatican and
[02:14:09.497 --> 02:14:15.341]  His main goal in life is to revert the Protestant Reformation.
[02:14:15.982 --> 02:14:21.806]  They are disgusted, the Vatican, that a new Christianity has emerged in Europe.
[02:14:22.426 --> 02:14:27.570]  They want... Well, Barry, from the information I've got is that they were trying to subvert the Catholics, the Protestants, everything.
[02:14:27.590 --> 02:14:30.012]  The Illuminati was trying to overthrow everything.
[02:14:31.033 --> 02:14:32.314]  No problem with that.
[02:14:32.734 --> 02:14:33.594]  That's what happened.
[02:14:33.915 --> 02:14:35.456]  Okay, so let's continue from there.
[02:14:36.116 --> 02:14:38.378]  That has been deeply ignored.
[02:14:39.056 --> 02:14:53.840]  And this is the branch that, combined with the Illuminati, has brought this world to its knees, and that is Yaakov Frank representing, okay, once again, Sabbateanism.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:00.742]  They wanted to turn the Jews into, again, Luciferians.
[02:15:01.362 --> 02:15:07.784]  Believers in Shabbat Zvi, that the Torah, the Talmud, everything that gave them moral reason
[02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:11.808]  To continue to be Jews was subverted.
[02:15:12.228 --> 02:15:20.450]  The Ten Commandments, which, again, Christian and Judaism, gave us a moral basis, were subverted upside down.
[02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:23.391]  And now let's fast forward, Doug, because we're going to get a break here in a few minutes.
[02:15:23.451 --> 02:15:24.291]  Fast forward, Doug.
[02:15:24.311 --> 02:15:25.451]  Okay, fast forward.
[02:15:25.832 --> 02:15:31.213]  They created what is known as the New World Order in Frankfurt, Germany in 1785.
[02:15:31.253 --> 02:15:34.914]  The Rothschilds provided the money
[02:15:36.557 --> 02:15:45.250]  To fuel this Jesuit-Illuminati combination with anti-Judaism, Sabbateanism.
[02:15:46.372 --> 02:15:48.816]  Does that put it into perspective for now?
[02:15:49.898 --> 02:16:02.486]  Well, Barry, I know that those groups were involved, and I'm not sitting here defending what happened with Catholicism, but from my research, the Illuminati was trying to take over Judaism, was trying to take over the Protestants, it was trying to take over the Catholics.
[02:16:03.026 --> 02:16:09.611]  This Luciferianism was taking over every guy as it could, including old line Masons.
[02:16:10.211 --> 02:16:11.592]  Now, that's the next step.
[02:16:13.306 --> 02:16:20.429]  I wouldn't so much say it's some tool of the Catholic Church itself, more than it's a group trying to take over everything.
[02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:25.012]  I would say they took over the Catholic Church itself.
[02:16:25.032 --> 02:16:29.654]  Yeah, so there's a difference between saying it's the Catholic Church or the Catholic Church is being taken over.
[02:16:29.854 --> 02:16:30.935]  But go ahead.
[02:16:31.755 --> 02:16:32.396]  Next step.
[02:16:32.536 --> 02:16:33.556]  You're absolutely right.
[02:16:34.237 --> 02:16:35.958]  The exposure of the Illuminati.
[02:16:36.738 --> 02:16:40.400]  Just before the French Revolution, you're aware of this history, of course.
[02:16:40.871 --> 02:16:50.593]  That the horsemen and the papers and the plan of the Illuminati was revealed throughout Europe and banned.
[02:16:51.273 --> 02:16:53.134]  Banned from country to country.
[02:16:53.734 --> 02:16:55.634]  And then we have the next stage.
[02:16:55.954 --> 02:17:00.135]  Because the Illuminati was banned, they took on a new strategy.
[02:17:00.515 --> 02:17:07.437]  We will subvert Masonism, free Masonry, and turn their edicts into our edicts.
[02:17:07.964 --> 02:17:13.027]  That is how Sabataeanism and the Illuminati spread worldwide.
[02:17:13.227 --> 02:17:17.669]  It was through Freemasonry, which my reading says was an okay organization.
[02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:22.651]  It was a guild before the Illuminati and the Sabataeans took them over.
[02:17:23.191 --> 02:17:24.772]  Now we have the spread of this.
[02:17:25.693 --> 02:17:27.694]  This is now going to America.
[02:17:28.234 --> 02:17:29.615]  This is now going to the world.
[02:17:29.635 --> 02:17:30.675]  All right, Barry.
[02:17:30.695 --> 02:17:31.255]  We've got a break.
[02:17:31.275 --> 02:17:36.338]  We'll come back and then fast forward even more to the early days of Adolf Hitler.
[02:17:37.202 --> 02:17:39.546]  And how he was supported by this group.
[02:17:40.308 --> 02:17:41.470]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:41.530 --> 02:17:44.775]  Ladies and gentlemen, the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:46.608 --> 02:17:50.231]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[02:18:48.473 --> 02:18:49.515]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:49.835 --> 02:18:52.619]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:57.046]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:57.487 --> 02:18:58.308]  So what do you do?
[02:18:58.629 --> 02:19:03.196]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:03.676 --> 02:19:05.797]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:06.277 --> 02:19:20.984]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:19:50.185 --> 02:19:51.485]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:51.925 --> 02:19:54.646]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:55.087 --> 02:19:57.707]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:58.168 --> 02:20:04.610]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:28.014 --> 02:20:29.515]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:21:41.573 --> 02:21:42.593]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:42.614 --> 02:21:43.654]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.974 --> 02:22:02.816]  Welcome to Barry Shamish, researcher, journalist, author.
[02:22:02.836 --> 02:22:05.637]  I'll tell you about some of his books and videos before he leaves us.
[02:22:06.037 --> 02:22:08.758]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to be taking your calls.
[02:22:08.778 --> 02:22:14.681]  Do you want to talk to Barry or ask his question about different news items or what's happening in the world?
[02:22:14.721 --> 02:22:16.142]  He's got a very interesting perspective.
[02:22:16.162 --> 02:22:16.602]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:16.622 --> 02:22:16.682]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:27.538 --> 02:22:31.543]  Then we fast forward to this group in the 1930s right through the 1940s.
[02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:35.448]  And by the way, we have their publications.
[02:22:35.508 --> 02:22:37.551]  It's not like we're claiming this.
[02:22:39.326 --> 02:22:47.310]  This, as you call them, Labor Zionist faction, which is the dominant faction, openly just laughing about Jews dying.
[02:22:47.350 --> 02:22:51.953]  I don't think it's funny when any group gets targeted and killed.
[02:22:52.973 --> 02:22:55.255]  I wonder why the ADL doesn't talk about it, Barry.
[02:22:55.875 --> 02:23:04.099]  Oh, you're talking... Forget any conventional Jewish group in America or elsewhere talking about it.
[02:23:06.141 --> 02:23:08.702]  The Labor Zionists have taken over all
[02:23:10.602 --> 02:23:13.883]  Jewish groups, you can forget that.
[02:23:14.643 --> 02:23:25.508]  What we have to do, and I've got a battle, is essentially to let Jews know that they have been infiltrated and that their worst enemy is from within.
[02:23:25.528 --> 02:23:28.189]  The ADL.
[02:23:28.609 --> 02:23:36.933]  Okay, that goes back to the B'nai B'rith and Scottish Freemasonry and everything else that went into forming the ADL.
[02:23:37.575 --> 02:23:38.375]  I've noticed the ADL...
[02:23:51.846 --> 02:23:56.429]  Determined to turn all of Judaism into anti-Judaism.
[02:23:56.729 --> 02:23:57.829]  So they're waging war?
[02:23:57.889 --> 02:24:01.351]  Now we rush forward because that's what we're doing in this interview.
[02:24:01.471 --> 02:24:01.931]  So Barry?
[02:24:01.971 --> 02:24:08.255]  I'm going to try to get the Jews to become something else, do something called the Enlightenment.
[02:24:08.615 --> 02:24:09.696]  There's a whole history.
[02:24:10.076 --> 02:24:19.541]  But the 1860s, British Freemasonry and the Sabbataians decided the best way to turn the Jews around
[02:24:20.641 --> 02:24:35.153]  So basically, convert or die if we're going to use Hitler to do it?
[02:24:36.314 --> 02:24:37.355]  Boy, are you jumping.
[02:24:37.395 --> 02:24:37.735]  Yes.
[02:24:38.836 --> 02:24:39.957]  Yes.
[02:24:40.197 --> 02:24:40.538]  Yes.
[02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:47.584]  Subtracting a whole lot of events before that, that was the ultimate yes.
[02:24:48.979 --> 02:25:07.086]  How would Albert Pike... If you want me to go through stage by stage how they did it, how they heated up Europe, how they blocked ports of the world to Jews who want to escape, the Cossacks and the pogroms, the fascists and the Nazis so they would be forced to go to Palestine?
[02:25:07.386 --> 02:25:07.986]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:25:09.127 --> 02:25:13.108]  I think I just did it in two sentences.
[02:25:13.428 --> 02:25:18.270]  The fact remains that Israel was not created as a refuge
[02:25:18.895 --> 02:25:23.076]  So much as to create a Sabbatean state.
[02:25:23.696 --> 02:25:29.737]  And this Sabbatean state would become the new Judaism.
[02:25:30.157 --> 02:25:37.498]  Once the Jews had to go to Palestine, they would have to become Sabbatean.
[02:25:37.758 --> 02:25:41.299]  Well, we're going to talk about that in a second.
[02:25:41.339 --> 02:25:46.540]  Which includes me, my family, my neighbors, and everyone I know
[02:25:47.225 --> 02:25:49.246]  Including the nation of Israel today.
[02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:51.408]  Well, who cared about them?
[02:25:51.748 --> 02:25:52.729]  Who cared about them?
[02:25:53.709 --> 02:25:58.173]  Now, I'm going to fast forward because this is not a simple interview.
[02:25:58.673 --> 02:26:02.776]  Apparently, we are talking with a very highly educated audience here.
[02:26:03.856 --> 02:26:08.740]  Usually, I have to do a cliff note, piece by piece, stage by stage explanation.
[02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:11.622]  But let's jump ahead.
[02:26:11.742 --> 02:26:12.262]  Why not?
[02:26:12.282 --> 02:26:13.763]  1932, Germany.
[02:26:17.003 --> 02:26:23.729]  There are over 250 Jewish groups representing the Jewish community in Germany.
[02:26:23.749 --> 02:26:26.832]  1934 Germany, all are banned by the Nazis but one.
[02:26:27.472 --> 02:26:28.953]  And that is Labor Zionism.
[02:26:29.574 --> 02:26:30.595]  They are legal.
[02:26:30.855 --> 02:26:34.958]  They are the only legal Jewish group in Germany.
[02:26:35.799 --> 02:26:43.586]  The Nazis allow them to take the Jewish community of Germany and put them into indoctrination camps.
[02:26:44.365 --> 02:26:46.026]  Where they are trained.
[02:26:46.366 --> 02:26:48.047]  You may call it Bolshevism.
[02:26:48.968 --> 02:26:50.428]  You may call it Socialism.
[02:26:50.468 --> 02:26:51.709]  You may call it whatever you want.
[02:26:51.749 --> 02:26:55.071]  So literally they were Judas goats then before Hitler.
[02:26:56.592 --> 02:26:57.412]  Well, yes.
[02:26:58.553 --> 02:26:59.413]  Yes, they were.
[02:27:00.814 --> 02:27:02.695]  But they were directed to Palestine.
[02:27:03.375 --> 02:27:10.799]  Now, again, I truly hope your listeners are following this with huge gaps
[02:27:11.568 --> 02:27:14.030]  Huge historical gaps in my explanations.
[02:27:14.930 --> 02:27:15.431]  I understand.
[02:27:15.451 --> 02:27:17.392]  Folks understand we don't have 15 hours.
[02:27:17.412 --> 02:27:19.674]  This isn't a college course.
[02:27:19.694 --> 02:27:20.975]  Barry, got to break again.
[02:27:21.175 --> 02:27:22.216]  We can't wait for this break.
[02:27:22.236 --> 02:27:23.116]  So we have to break.
[02:27:23.456 --> 02:27:25.998]  We'll come right back, finish up, and then we got to go to some calls.
[02:27:26.038 --> 02:27:26.719]  People have been holding.
[02:27:26.739 --> 02:27:28.000]  They want to talk to you.
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:28.160]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:33.784]  We'll have to have Barry Hamish obviously back on sometime in the future.
[02:27:33.824 --> 02:27:34.604]  So much to talk about.
[02:27:36.826 --> 02:27:37.766]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.227 --> 02:27:39.728]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:43.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.288 --> 02:27:49.728]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[02:27:50.129 --> 02:27:55.149]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[02:27:55.269 --> 02:27:56.650]  But now, we don't have to.
[02:27:56.930 --> 02:28:05.091]  This sacral wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[02:28:05.431 --> 02:28:09.452]  Simply lie on your back with the sacral wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[02:28:09.712 --> 02:28:12.472]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[02:28:12.892 --> 02:28:16.393]  Use the sacral wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[02:28:16.833 --> 02:28:20.494]  Get your sacral wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:20.734 --> 02:28:21.634]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:23.254 --> 02:28:26.915]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:28:27.155 --> 02:28:30.035]  And ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment, too.
[02:28:30.415 --> 02:28:32.716]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[02:28:33.036 --> 02:28:36.337]  Get your sacral wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.
[02:28:36.637 --> 02:28:36.877]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:36.917 --> 02:28:37.197]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:28:37.217 --> 02:28:38.137]  And give yourself a wedgie.
[02:28:46.781 --> 02:28:54.309]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:54.589 --> 02:29:05.500]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:06.060]  We're good to go.
[02:29:22.236 --> 02:29:22.737]  That's right.
[02:29:22.917 --> 02:29:30.043]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:30.323 --> 02:29:38.750]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.770 --> 02:29:39.291]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:47.589 --> 02:29:51.473]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:29:51.613 --> 02:29:53.374]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:29:53.434 --> 02:29:54.695]  But not just any water.
[02:29:54.775 --> 02:29:58.979]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[02:29:59.059 --> 02:30:08.768]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:30:09.008 --> 02:30:09.549]  We're good to go.
[02:30:24.105 --> 02:30:26.346]  For more information, visit rpa-biotech.com or call 1-866-884-9104.
[02:30:26.386 --> 02:30:26.746]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[02:30:46.608 --> 02:30:55.254]  All right.
[02:30:55.454 --> 02:30:59.818]  Bob, Kevin, Walt, James, and others, your calls are just a few minutes away.
[02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:09.004]  And as Barry Chambers said, skipping large gaps of history that even document this more, a lot of universities are even talking about this.
[02:31:09.064 --> 02:31:10.765]  Even some leftists are now talking about it.
[02:31:10.845 --> 02:31:11.606]  Conservatives are.
[02:31:12.347 --> 02:31:13.208]  We're good to go.
[02:31:13.268 --> 02:31:13.749]  I think?
[02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:36.673]  Hitler was nuttier than the fruitcake, folks.
[02:31:36.693 --> 02:31:41.657]  He had Buddhist monks and Tibetan monks, and he did weird seances and sacrifices.
[02:31:41.697 --> 02:31:47.041]  That's even on History Channel, cutting people's heads off and then trying to make the heads read the future.
[02:31:47.701 --> 02:31:49.422]  I mean, this is Luciferianism.
[02:31:49.542 --> 02:31:53.245]  It's what I discovered with Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones and all of it.
[02:31:54.326 --> 02:31:59.529]  But, Barry, bring us up to Nazi Germany and what happened there.
[02:32:00.490 --> 02:32:00.990]  All righty.
[02:32:01.451 --> 02:32:04.473]  Now, again, we're talking about a deal.
[02:32:05.322 --> 02:32:07.563]  It's called the Transfer Agreement.
[02:32:08.263 --> 02:32:11.964]  In this deal, Germany agrees to send its Jews to Palestine.
[02:32:12.824 --> 02:32:23.507]  The Labor government agrees that all the Jews' resources, all their assets, bank accounts, everything they have, will go back to Germany.
[02:32:23.607 --> 02:32:25.067]  It will buy German products.
[02:32:25.588 --> 02:32:27.408]  There are several books on the subject.
[02:32:28.648 --> 02:32:34.650]  The Transfer Agreement by Edwin Black is probably your best source
[02:32:36.005 --> 02:32:43.768]  Of this horrible, horrible agreement between the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem and the Nazis.
[02:32:44.308 --> 02:32:50.330]  In other words, to get Jews to Palestine, they abandoned the rest of European Jewry.
[02:32:50.350 --> 02:32:51.590]  They got the Jews they wanted.
[02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:56.352]  And to be clear, they frustrated and blocked England and the U.S.
[02:32:56.752 --> 02:33:00.793]  and anybody else letting Jews get out, even when Hitler wanted to get rid of them.
[02:33:00.813 --> 02:33:03.094]  Even worse, while the Holocaust was taking place,
[02:33:03.664 --> 02:33:19.096]  Right in the United States, the head of the reform movement, his name was Rabbi Wise, Stephen Wise, I hate to use the term Rabbi, made sure that FDR and Congress did nothing to rescue European Jewry.
[02:33:19.537 --> 02:33:19.917]  Nothing.
[02:33:20.450 --> 02:33:24.313]  Now, again, I could do this point by point and prove it.
[02:33:24.733 --> 02:33:26.194]  Well, let me just stop you.
[02:33:26.574 --> 02:33:31.097]  The Newt Riccardi Jewish... The Newt Riccardi.
[02:33:31.157 --> 02:33:36.140]  I mean, all over the world, they bring forward the documents and they say the exact same thing.
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:40.643]  They're right on one point, but they're very, very wrong in their strategy.
[02:33:40.683 --> 02:33:41.644]  Well, sure.
[02:33:42.384 --> 02:33:44.806]  But regardless, I was bringing up the point that they're mad about
[02:33:45.246 --> 02:33:47.747]  About how the Zionists blocked them from getting their families.
[02:33:47.847 --> 02:33:51.588]  Yes, they're absolutely right, but their strategy is horrible.
[02:33:52.048 --> 02:34:02.190]  They are making alliances with the worst enemies of Jewry in the world, and it's just... I don't want to get us down a rabbit trail, I was just bringing that up, but back to Hitler, please.
[02:34:02.390 --> 02:34:04.191]  Historically, okay, they're right.
[02:34:04.951 --> 02:34:08.992]  The fact of the matter is that had there been no Zionism... Labor Zionism.
[02:34:09.372 --> 02:34:12.653]  Now, I want to make this point because there was an alternative Zionism
[02:34:13.143 --> 02:34:31.793]  Which almost all Israelis back, and they even thought Sharon was an advocate of, which is called, well, back in the 30s it was called revisionist Zionism, that tried to wipe out labor Zionism, tried to wipe out the transfer agreement, tried to save the Jews of Europe.
[02:34:32.474 --> 02:34:34.875]  And this is what Israelis believe in.
[02:34:35.275 --> 02:34:38.437]  Israelis have rejected their leadership.
[02:34:39.088 --> 02:34:44.412]  Of 120 members of the Knesset, only 18 are labor Zionists today.
[02:34:44.793 --> 02:34:52.639]  But they run the media, they run the banks, they run the universities, they run our lives, even though we all hate them.
[02:34:52.899 --> 02:34:54.280]  They got the globalist backing.
[02:34:54.961 --> 02:34:56.943]  Oh, they are the globalist backing.
[02:34:58.023 --> 02:34:59.384]  Yes, they do.
[02:35:00.906 --> 02:35:04.869]  Now, I'm again hoping that we see the logic here.
[02:35:06.350 --> 02:35:08.652]  When did they become truly exposed
[02:35:09.164 --> 02:35:12.606]  was in 1993 with the Oslo Agreement.
[02:35:12.946 --> 02:35:16.408]  They decided that the PLO and Israel should be friends.
[02:35:17.669 --> 02:35:22.191]  This is when the Israeli people knew that they were going to be committing suicide.
[02:35:22.772 --> 02:35:24.993]  And this is when I started my writing, by the way.
[02:35:26.274 --> 02:35:32.197]  Had there been no so-called peace agreement, I would never have written a word of this.
[02:35:32.797 --> 02:35:36.780]  But me and other people, including...
[02:35:37.970 --> 02:35:40.951]  Basically, all of Israel knew we were going to kill ourselves.
[02:35:41.551 --> 02:35:44.672]  We were actually going to kill ourselves as a nation.
[02:35:44.712 --> 02:35:45.552]  Well, let's do this.
[02:35:45.752 --> 02:35:47.712]  Before you leave us, let's talk a little bit about them.
[02:35:47.732 --> 02:35:49.493]  We'll also talk about some of your books and videos.
[02:35:49.533 --> 02:35:52.274]  I've read one of your books and also seen one of your books.
[02:35:52.354 --> 02:35:53.514]  Please send me your address.
[02:35:53.854 --> 02:35:55.334]  I'll send you the whole package.
[02:35:56.094 --> 02:35:59.875]  Much has happened since I researched who murdered Yitzhak Rabin.
[02:36:00.235 --> 02:36:05.697]  Yitzhak Rabin tried to put a stop to the suicide and he didn't last long when he did.
[02:36:07.961 --> 02:36:08.523]  Okay.
[02:36:08.663 --> 02:36:12.152]  Listen, let's take a few calls here, Barry, because we've got about 20 minutes left.
[02:36:12.773 --> 02:36:14.898]  All right, but we haven't got to the meat yet.
[02:36:16.417 --> 02:36:19.158]  We'll try to get to the meat here at the end.
[02:36:19.178 --> 02:36:20.959]  I think we've covered quite a bit of meat.
[02:36:21.019 --> 02:36:22.100]  I'm in a meat market here.
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:23.821]  Bob in Texas.
[02:36:24.261 --> 02:36:25.162]  Bob, thanks for holding.
[02:36:25.202 --> 02:36:26.322]  You're on the air with Barry Hamish.
[02:36:26.362 --> 02:36:29.064]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:36:29.104 --> 02:36:30.204]  Let me jump way forward.
[02:36:30.364 --> 02:36:38.549]  Is there a New World Order plan afoot, Barry, to nuke selected Middle Eastern countries and possibly including Israel?
[02:36:40.109 --> 02:36:40.870]  Interesting.
[02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:42.171]  Take away nuke.
[02:36:42.211 --> 02:36:43.331]  They don't have to nuke.
[02:36:44.052 --> 02:36:44.672]  Number one.
[02:36:45.934 --> 02:36:46.954]  Remember something.
[02:36:47.074 --> 02:36:48.295]  Israel is falling apart.
[02:36:48.715 --> 02:36:55.136]  When they took the Jews out of Gaza, they took away a community that had turned desert into farms.
[02:36:55.676 --> 02:37:01.938]  They had destroyed the lives of 10,000 people and begun the process of the division of Israel.
[02:37:02.478 --> 02:37:03.598]  It's the same in Iraq.
[02:37:04.218 --> 02:37:15.201]  They don't care because the plan is ultimately to bring in a new world order block, just like the EU in the Middle East.
[02:37:15.896 --> 02:37:25.060]  In other words, from Morocco to Iran, you're going to have not many countries, including Israel, you are going to see one block.
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:26.921]  That's what they're aiming at.
[02:37:27.421 --> 02:37:40.967]  Now, believe it or not, again, I say this because I don't believe Americans can believe it, the same insurgents, as you call them in Iraq, are fighting the same people as the Gaza residents
[02:37:41.617 --> 02:37:44.439]  We're fighting the same forces.
[02:37:44.959 --> 02:37:46.561]  They're breaking up the Middle East.
[02:37:47.021 --> 02:37:48.362]  Syria is next, by the way.
[02:37:48.802 --> 02:37:51.164]  Now, I can give you an amazing example.
[02:37:51.204 --> 02:38:01.631]  Just two days ago, the entire Israeli press was claiming that Syria was behind a very recent rocket attack on an Israeli city.
[02:38:01.791 --> 02:38:02.612]  I don't believe it.
[02:38:03.252 --> 02:38:04.193]  I don't believe it at all.
[02:38:04.253 --> 02:38:07.295]  I think they're preparing the way for...
[02:38:07.708 --> 02:38:09.549]  For an attack on Syria.
[02:38:09.729 --> 02:38:10.269]  No, you're right.
[02:38:10.289 --> 02:38:11.290]  We're just going to go into it.
[02:38:11.310 --> 02:38:13.771]  Look, it's any sovereign country has to go down.
[02:38:14.071 --> 02:38:16.452]  They call sovereign countries rogue nations.
[02:38:16.532 --> 02:38:17.312]  Bob, great points.
[02:38:17.332 --> 02:38:17.953]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:18.213 --> 02:38:19.493]  Kevin and Max.
[02:38:19.553 --> 02:38:20.694]  Yes, that's what I meant.
[02:38:21.714 --> 02:38:25.656]  They're all going to go down, including Israel, to create this bloc.
[02:38:26.283 --> 02:38:30.447]  The bloc, of course, will meld with the EU.
[02:38:30.947 --> 02:38:32.308]  It's the same thing with Serbia.
[02:38:32.409 --> 02:38:39.395]  Any strong, independent country, whether it's Iraq, whether it's Israel, whether it's Serbia, it's going down.
[02:38:40.576 --> 02:38:41.757]  Let's talk to Kevin in Mass.
[02:38:41.777 --> 02:38:42.618]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:38:42.658 --> 02:38:43.058]  Go ahead.
[02:38:43.398 --> 02:38:44.379]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:44.499 --> 02:38:46.161]  It's an honor to be here.
[02:38:48.138 --> 02:38:49.601]  I'm a Catholic, I assure you.
[02:38:50.122 --> 02:38:51.744]  I'm up in Boston area.
[02:38:51.764 --> 02:39:02.141]  I'm a Catholic, and I believe that most of us are good, God-fearing people, but I also know that within my church that there is infiltration, as there is in Judaism.
[02:39:02.543 --> 02:39:05.405]  But Judaism is full of wonderful people.
[02:39:05.685 --> 02:39:07.327]  Well, there's infiltrators in everything.
[02:39:07.347 --> 02:39:08.888]  That's why the globalists are in control.
[02:39:09.168 --> 02:39:18.935]  Well, don't you think that the way to fight them, and I feel they're losing because I feel as they're pushing their boot down on us, they're really doing it because they're losing.
[02:39:18.975 --> 02:39:19.736]  People are waking up.
[02:39:19.776 --> 02:39:20.657]  We're joining together.
[02:39:20.677 --> 02:39:21.757]  We're strengthening families.
[02:39:21.777 --> 02:39:23.118]  We're aware of what they're up to.
[02:39:25.020 --> 02:39:26.461]  People are aware of the connections of the
[02:39:28.234 --> 02:39:32.256]  I've read this stuff.
[02:39:32.476 --> 02:39:35.477]  I'm following along with Alex, and I think a lot of people out there are.
[02:39:35.677 --> 02:39:37.137]  That's widely known now, Barry.
[02:39:37.177 --> 02:39:38.138]  Thanks for your work and others.
[02:39:38.578 --> 02:39:44.720]  I'm shocked, and the person speaking to me shocks me even more how knowledgeable he is.
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:49.081]  I just want to say that my question to you is,
[02:39:49.815 --> 02:40:11.555]  When you read and expose all the evil that you do, and you're like Alex in Israel, you document what you have to say, do you believe, because they believe in it, whether you believe it or not, they believe in it, but do you believe that there is God that will make a stand and will judge us on how we face this in the world?
[02:40:12.516 --> 02:40:13.537]  I wish he'd hurry up.
[02:40:14.267 --> 02:40:14.707]  Really?
[02:40:14.727 --> 02:40:17.368]  I mean, he's taking his time.
[02:40:17.708 --> 02:40:20.869]  He's taking his sweet time while my country is going down the tubes.
[02:40:21.069 --> 02:40:21.950]  I hear you.
[02:40:22.090 --> 02:40:22.590]  Yes, I do.
[02:40:23.130 --> 02:40:23.990]  Yes, I do.
[02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:26.431]  But, honest, I'm disappointed in him.
[02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:29.232]  Well, I'm not disappointed in God.
[02:40:29.292 --> 02:40:30.572]  God knows what he's doing.
[02:40:31.233 --> 02:40:32.313]  I think we're getting close.
[02:40:32.373 --> 02:40:35.634]  I wish he would really set his alarm clock to tomorrow morning.
[02:40:36.064 --> 02:40:37.346]  I've put an end to all this.
[02:40:37.366 --> 02:40:39.128]  My name is going down.
[02:40:39.228 --> 02:40:39.989]  It's going down.
[02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:43.533]  We can certainly ask God.
[02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:46.576]  It's all in God's plan.
[02:40:46.977 --> 02:40:53.404]  Well, I think the more people we wake up, some of those people that are complicit in carrying out this evil can still be saved.
[02:40:53.424 --> 02:40:54.766]  They don't know what they're doing, but they...
[02:40:55.253 --> 02:40:56.654]  You know, they have to make their choice.
[02:40:56.714 --> 02:40:57.635]  The time is running out.
[02:40:57.675 --> 02:40:59.657]  Well, so much of this is compartmentalized.
[02:40:59.737 --> 02:41:02.900]  I mean, do cops in the United States like it?
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:08.406]  They're going to pay thousands of dollars a year for electronic toll roads that track them so Juan Carlos can make money?
[02:41:08.926 --> 02:41:12.370]  Let's talk to Walt in Michigan.
[02:41:12.390 --> 02:41:13.250]  Thanks for holding, Walt.
[02:41:13.270 --> 02:41:14.492]  You're on the air with Barry Hummish.
[02:41:14.832 --> 02:41:14.932]  Yes.
[02:41:15.533 --> 02:41:15.713]  Yes.
[02:41:16.269 --> 02:41:18.291]  I'd like to ask you a straight-up question.
[02:41:18.731 --> 02:41:18.991]  Sure.
[02:41:19.191 --> 02:41:25.917]  Gerald Overhart covers the exact subject you've been covering with Mr. Shamish, and I've emailed Mr. Shamish in the past.
[02:41:26.437 --> 02:41:27.898]  I've contacted him.
[02:41:27.938 --> 02:41:28.939]  We've had communication.
[02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:30.480]  So what I'm talking about is this.
[02:41:31.141 --> 02:41:37.986]  I would like to have a broad discussion on the Catholic Church's involvement in the New World Order.
[02:41:38.426 --> 02:41:38.707]  Okay?
[02:41:39.772 --> 02:41:59.304]  I understand, and I'm not saying that you're avoiding the discussion, Alex, but I think you need to have a long-term discussion about the Catholic Church's involvement with this new world order, the people who are involved in it, the Black Pope, the guy that's behind the Pope that's there.
[02:41:59.884 --> 02:42:01.305]  Well, my only point is this, sir.
[02:42:01.345 --> 02:42:02.806]  You're on the air right now.
[02:42:02.826 --> 02:42:04.348]  Nobody's stopping you.
[02:42:04.368 --> 02:42:12.434]  Well, we need to discuss the Catholic Church's involvement in the mass murder of 600,000 to 1 million Christians that were in Croatia.
[02:42:28.687 --> 02:42:34.908]  At the beginning of World War II, the involvement of the Jesuits controlling Zionism.
[02:42:35.929 --> 02:42:41.110]  The Catholic Church is the richest organization in the world, including the Rothschilds.
[02:42:41.170 --> 02:42:44.170]  The Rothschilds got a lot of bucks.
[02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:45.211]  What's your proof of that?
[02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:47.751]  Who's the Vatican banker?
[02:42:49.971 --> 02:42:55.073]  I know people hide their funds, but I've looked at... The Catholic Church in many areas is bankrupt.
[02:42:55.473 --> 02:42:56.933]  The Catholic Church in Rome...
[02:42:57.583 --> 02:43:01.366]  The Vahanchos in Rome, the Vatican's bankers, the Rothschilds.
[02:43:02.526 --> 02:43:04.488]  The Rothschilds do the banking for the Vatican.
[02:43:04.808 --> 02:43:05.008]  Yeah.
[02:43:05.629 --> 02:43:07.850]  That needs to be discussed openly, brother.
[02:43:09.111 --> 02:43:12.773]  Look, my book... Okay, you know what?
[02:43:13.234 --> 02:43:14.835]  I'm going to give my email address again.
[02:43:16.656 --> 02:43:18.557]  We just don't have the time to do this properly.
[02:43:19.058 --> 02:43:22.280]  Look at my new book, Shabtai Tzvi, Labor Zionism and the Holocaust.
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:23.901]  What the man said is right.
[02:43:24.919 --> 02:43:32.324]  Uh, Chamish, C-H-A-M-I-S-H, at NetVision, N-E-T-V-I-S-I-O-N, dot net dot I-L.
[02:43:32.384 --> 02:43:34.665]  Chamish at NetVision, dot net dot I-L.
[02:43:34.685 --> 02:43:35.986]  What the man said is right.
[02:43:36.246 --> 02:43:38.508]  Well, why don't you just give your website out itself?
[02:43:38.868 --> 02:43:41.229]  Oh, you can't get the books to the website.
[02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:42.770]  There's problems with the webmaster.
[02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:45.352]  But go look at the information anyways.
[02:43:45.372 --> 02:43:46.212]  You're absolutely right.
[02:43:46.673 --> 02:43:51.976]  Barry Chamish, one word, B-A-R-R-Y-C-H-A-M-I-S-H, dot com.
[02:43:52.483 --> 02:43:54.545]  Look who your new Federal Reserve Chairman is.
[02:43:54.565 --> 02:43:55.766]  If that's not Sabbataean, nothing is Sabbataean.
[02:44:22.117 --> 02:44:27.860]  They're controlling your banking through the Rothschilds, through the Jesuits, and I document it.
[02:44:28.041 --> 02:44:29.601]  I document it.
[02:44:29.702 --> 02:44:34.845]  Again, what worries me more than anything else is they're setting up another Holocaust in Israel.
[02:44:35.045 --> 02:44:35.345]  I'm not kidding.
[02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:36.966]  They're putting up a giant wall just like they did
[02:44:41.467 --> 02:44:48.489]  In Europe in the 1940s, we're being trapped, we're being corralled, and we are in big, big trouble.
[02:44:48.549 --> 02:44:52.490]  Oh, Barry, so you see that as a cage to keep Jews in?
[02:44:53.130 --> 02:44:54.710]  Of course, what else is it?
[02:44:56.311 --> 02:44:56.931]  Yes, I do.
[02:44:57.071 --> 02:45:03.733]  And then the public sees it as something to keep the Palestinians... Nah, please, in an age of missiles, what's a piece of cement going to do?
[02:45:04.193 --> 02:45:04.373]  Look...
[02:45:05.262 --> 02:45:09.005]  We are being the same pattern and strategy.
[02:45:09.646 --> 02:45:12.228]  And unfortunately, the Jews are as dumb as ever.
[02:45:12.248 --> 02:45:14.589]  They don't learn from history.
[02:45:14.609 --> 02:45:16.111]  We're going to take another call right now.
[02:45:16.231 --> 02:45:17.412]  James in Tennessee.
[02:45:17.812 --> 02:45:18.613]  James, go ahead.
[02:45:18.633 --> 02:45:19.293]  You're on the air.
[02:45:19.313 --> 02:45:20.114]  Hello.
[02:45:20.134 --> 02:45:22.976]  There's a question for you, Guest.
[02:45:23.196 --> 02:45:26.639]  Earlier, you had mentioned the Talmud and the Bible.
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:30.602]  What does the Talmud have to do with Judaism?
[02:45:31.903 --> 02:45:32.484]  Interesting.
[02:45:32.504 --> 02:45:34.485]  Such a simple question.
[02:45:34.505 --> 02:45:35.727]  Do we have the next eight hours?
[02:45:36.287 --> 02:45:37.688]  Let's put it this way.
[02:45:38.249 --> 02:45:41.332]  There are sections in the Talmud that are completely obsolete.
[02:45:42.112 --> 02:45:52.922]  However, it is the oral tradition put down in paper about 1,600 years ago, and that's how the communities in the diaspora remained Jews.
[02:45:53.362 --> 02:45:58.247]  Now, what we've got now with Sabbateanism is that every decent Jew
[02:45:58.914 --> 02:46:01.876]  They're called Poschim in Hebrew.
[02:46:01.896 --> 02:46:16.286]  A rabbinical dissertation, for lack of a better explanation, is being turned into an anti-rabbinical dissertation.
[02:46:16.786 --> 02:46:20.809]  The problem is the Talmud and keeping a community together was very, very good.
[02:46:20.829 --> 02:46:27.033]  The problem with Zionism is they're taking the very best of the Torah and the Talmud
[02:46:27.392 --> 02:46:31.156]  What we all believe in and turning it into the opposite.
[02:46:31.256 --> 02:46:31.536]  Okay.
[02:46:32.097 --> 02:46:35.740]  I want to make a comment here, if I can, going back to the Catholic situation.
[02:46:36.541 --> 02:46:38.703]  You know, I don't even call myself a Protestant.
[02:46:38.723 --> 02:46:40.825]  I don't call myself a Catholic.
[02:46:40.905 --> 02:46:46.411]  I don't call myself... I'm a Christian, and so I believe in the Bible.
[02:46:47.352 --> 02:46:47.492]  And...
[02:46:49.477 --> 02:46:56.464]  Then I, as soon as we start all fighting with each other, somebody calls in and says, Jews are evil, I say, no, I disagree with that.
[02:46:56.504 --> 02:46:58.807]  Somebody calls in and says, blacks are evil, I disagree with that.
[02:46:59.187 --> 02:47:03.011]  Somebody calls in and says, Protestants are evil, or Catholics are evil, I disagree with that.
[02:47:03.512 --> 02:47:11.160]  I'm telling you, I've studied this, folks, and it's the same evil group of Luciferians, and they all work with each other, whether it's a Jew or a German,
[02:47:11.721 --> 02:47:12.482]  It doesn't matter.
[02:47:12.762 --> 02:47:13.963]  They're of the same spirit.
[02:47:14.383 --> 02:47:15.504]  They can be Chinese.
[02:47:15.964 --> 02:47:17.365]  It's evil people.
[02:47:17.445 --> 02:47:18.686]  It's the same throughout history.
[02:47:18.986 --> 02:47:20.327]  And that's just what the evidence shows.
[02:47:20.347 --> 02:47:27.373]  So I think whenever we get into a thing of this group runs it or that group runs it, it's an evil group that is running all the groups.
[02:47:27.993 --> 02:47:36.560]  And so if we sit here and say it's one group, it's that group, all that does is alienate a whole group of good people who just don't know how they're being manipulated.
[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:37.200]  That's my point.
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:38.201]  Amen.
[02:47:38.221 --> 02:47:38.981]  You got it right.
[02:47:40.002 --> 02:47:40.963]  All I can tell you
[02:47:41.537 --> 02:47:52.740]  Is that the Jews of 18th century Europe became, by accident, through their leadership, they were guided into, what can I tell you?
[02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:55.421]  They were guided into their own demise.
[02:47:56.321 --> 02:48:03.423]  The Jews have died because their leaders in the 18th century became satanic.
[02:48:04.304 --> 02:48:05.224]  As simple as that.
[02:48:05.584 --> 02:48:08.805]  They allied themselves with the Illuminati through Weishaupt,
[02:48:10.053 --> 02:48:12.055]  And again, not the Jews, the leaders.
[02:48:12.435 --> 02:48:14.197]  Don't get me wrong for a second here.
[02:48:14.778 --> 02:48:15.619]  We're guided.
[02:48:16.059 --> 02:48:18.342]  The Vatican wants Jerusalem back.
[02:48:18.382 --> 02:48:20.364]  The Vatican does not want Jews in Jerusalem.
[02:48:20.785 --> 02:48:22.426]  They want a new crusade.
[02:48:23.007 --> 02:48:23.788]  All of this.
[02:48:24.566 --> 02:48:26.888]  ...is going on today in my country.
[02:48:27.289 --> 02:48:30.392]  Now, please allow me to state something.
[02:48:30.632 --> 02:48:31.593]  Well, we're almost out of time.
[02:48:31.613 --> 02:48:32.533]  We've got one more segment.
[02:48:32.553 --> 02:48:33.234]  Stay there, Barry.
[02:48:33.294 --> 02:48:35.436]  We'll let you comment in the final segment.
[02:48:35.456 --> 02:48:38.098]  Then the show's over, so we'll have to stop there.
[02:48:38.579 --> 02:48:41.482]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:48:41.542 --> 02:48:42.863]  Get the new film, Martial Law.
[02:48:46.681 --> 02:48:48.183]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:48.383 --> 02:48:51.466]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.606 --> 02:48:55.509]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.549 --> 02:48:59.793]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:49:00.134 --> 02:49:03.877]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.997 --> 02:49:05.739]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:06.039 --> 02:49:09.361]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:09.401 --> 02:49:14.103]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:14.243 --> 02:49:17.285]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:17.485 --> 02:49:20.346]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.827 --> 02:49:26.930]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:27.470 --> 02:49:27.991]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.022 --> 02:49:48.002]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:48.082 --> 02:49:58.784]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:59.164 --> 02:50:03.685]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.745 --> 02:50:15.087]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.687 --> 02:50:22.529]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:22.909 --> 02:50:25.050]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:30.532]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:50:30.832 --> 02:50:36.954]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-8033.
[02:50:38.174 --> 02:50:53.787]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:54.027 --> 02:50:56.269]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:56.469 --> 02:51:02.815]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[02:51:03.155 --> 02:51:03.795]  We're good to go.
[02:51:23.404 --> 02:51:24.005]  We're good to go.
[02:51:55.186 --> 02:52:02.334]  Well, tonight I'm going to show my new film, The Order of Death, that gets into the New World Order and the Luciferianism that is controlling it.
[02:52:02.374 --> 02:52:03.436]  I mean, it's just the facts.
[02:52:04.337 --> 02:52:07.000]  Alamo to Raftow, South Lamar, 7 o'clock tonight.
[02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:11.024]  Even if you're unable to get tickets online, I think they've sold out.
[02:52:11.044 --> 02:52:13.848]  They still have a limited number that they sell at the door.
[02:52:13.888 --> 02:52:14.829]  They hold some.
[02:52:15.498 --> 02:52:16.939]  We'll try to drop by and get those.
[02:52:17.279 --> 02:52:21.682]  And if you just want to drop by and get a video or a book or a DVD or something, I'll be there as well.
[02:52:21.702 --> 02:52:25.545]  You can still come into the lobby area and I'll be there before the film and right after it.
[02:52:27.926 --> 02:52:28.987]  We're almost out of time.
[02:52:29.027 --> 02:52:30.288]  No more time to take calls.
[02:52:30.448 --> 02:52:33.590]  We've got just a minute or two left with Barry Chamish.
[02:52:34.130 --> 02:52:37.052]  Barry, finish up the key point you were trying to make.
[02:52:37.973 --> 02:52:39.394]  Alex, I feel I failed today.
[02:52:40.755 --> 02:52:42.596]  I didn't put into the proper context
[02:52:43.231 --> 02:52:44.672]  Well, I don't think you failed.
[02:52:44.712 --> 02:52:45.633]  I think you did a good job.
[02:52:45.653 --> 02:52:46.274]  You shouldn't say that.
[02:52:46.934 --> 02:52:47.675]  Oh, thank you.
[02:52:48.135 --> 02:52:48.455]  Thank you.
[02:52:48.495 --> 02:52:52.839]  I tried to get a few of the points, but again, I was in Texas a few years back.
[02:52:53.019 --> 02:52:54.801]  By the way, you have really nice people in Texas.
[02:52:55.601 --> 02:52:57.703]  And I gave my speeches and my lectures.
[02:52:57.763 --> 02:53:02.507]  I guess I can't do it in a radio show with people who actually understand the subject.
[02:53:02.967 --> 02:53:06.350]  But we're talking about documented proof.
[02:53:07.231 --> 02:53:10.313]  We're talking that I'm holding on the Rabin assassination over 2,500 people
[02:53:11.641 --> 02:53:12.342]  Documents.
[02:53:12.802 --> 02:53:16.604]  We're talking about over 40 hours of video which I present.
[02:53:17.325 --> 02:53:22.728]  And please, your listeners, I didn't fill in the picture today.
[02:53:23.189 --> 02:53:28.292]  But Israel is in desperate danger from my family, my friends.
[02:53:29.172 --> 02:53:31.294]  We are in desperate danger.
[02:53:31.434 --> 02:53:32.995]  Are you in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem?
[02:53:33.315 --> 02:53:34.436]  I'm right between.
[02:53:34.756 --> 02:53:35.997]  I'm in a place called Modin.
[02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:53.013]  Try and understand that Israel is not going to last very much longer unless we somehow or another all band together and somehow expose the people that are wrecking the Middle East.
[02:53:53.493 --> 02:53:56.614]  And by the way, if the Arabs don't wake up, they're next.
[02:53:58.034 --> 02:53:58.995]  They should understand.
[02:53:59.335 --> 02:54:00.915]  We may be first, but they're next.
[02:54:02.472 --> 02:54:06.134]  Well, the globalists are manipulating all the sides to order out of chaos.
[02:54:06.375 --> 02:54:10.217]  And, Barry, I really appreciate you taking time out to join us.
[02:54:10.237 --> 02:54:14.640]  People can find out more information at your website or by emailing you to get in contact.
[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:15.701]  Give folks your email again.
[02:54:16.621 --> 02:54:17.041]  Please.
[02:54:17.402 --> 02:54:21.164]  I have books and I have a CD called Shabtai See Labor Zionism and the Holocaust.
[02:54:21.644 --> 02:54:24.766]  I recorded with the American Freedom Network in Denver two years ago.
[02:54:25.507 --> 02:54:30.270]  And it's chamish, one word, C-H-A-M-I-S-H, at netvision.com.
[02:54:30.643 --> 02:54:37.788]  Also one word, netvision.net.
[02:54:38.188 --> 02:54:40.289]  I'll get you the whole picture if you just write me.
[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:44.272]  Barry, look forward to talking to you in the future again, and take care.
[02:54:44.892 --> 02:54:45.472]  You were great.
[02:54:45.552 --> 02:54:46.313]  Thank you very much.
[02:54:46.653 --> 02:54:47.194]  Thank you.
[02:54:47.774 --> 02:54:49.055]  Very interesting perspective.
[02:54:49.155 --> 02:54:53.417]  I agree with most of what he's saying, especially the research on radiating the children.
[02:54:53.437 --> 02:54:54.198]  That's admitted.
[02:54:55.159 --> 02:54:57.380]  The Zionists working with Hitler, that's admitted.
[02:54:58.468 --> 02:55:02.449]  And the Illuminati is basically taking everything over, folks.
[02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:07.411]  I mean, you have these existing orders, and they're all sort of just getting taken over.
[02:55:07.711 --> 02:55:11.432]  Whether they were good, bad, or ugly, or indifferent, they've been taken over.
[02:55:11.632 --> 02:55:15.034]  And the globalists count on us thinking it's one group.
[02:55:15.554 --> 02:55:20.275]  They don't want us to have the wide spectrum view to see the total manipulation.
[02:55:21.176 --> 02:55:22.016]  But we're going to do that.
[02:55:23.512 --> 02:55:28.675]  I really hope that all of you will get my new film, Martial Law, that details how the globalists carried out 9-11.
[02:55:28.695 --> 02:55:30.556]  It's the best 9-11 video out there, bar none.
[02:55:31.197 --> 02:55:33.598]  Wide spectrum of data, giving you the big view.
[02:55:34.178 --> 02:55:36.479]  How they did it, why they did it, how we can expose them.
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:38.961]  Martial Law, the miniseries.
[02:55:38.981 --> 02:55:40.562]  Three hours long, one DVD.
[02:55:40.602 --> 02:55:42.283]  Go to Infowars.com to order it.
[02:55:43.043 --> 02:55:44.684]  Or call, feel free to get any of my films.
[02:55:44.764 --> 02:55:47.125]  I can answer questions about all the big specials we've gotten.
[02:55:47.145 --> 02:55:51.888]  Got a new t-shirt special with her $9.95 when you get multiple...
[02:55:53.247 --> 02:55:53.648]  Church.
[02:55:54.370 --> 02:55:54.651]  Come on.
[02:55:55.276 --> 02:55:57.497]  I think I make like four bucks on those because they're made in America.
[02:55:58.037 --> 02:56:00.198]  Yeah, made in America shirts are five, six bucks.
[02:56:00.258 --> 02:56:02.039]  Made in Mexico is like two.
[02:56:02.059 --> 02:56:03.159]  But hey, it doesn't matter.
[02:56:03.499 --> 02:56:04.480]  Get some of the t-shirts.
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:10.262]  Infowars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:10.742 --> 02:56:14.844]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:56:15.464 --> 02:56:18.806]  Or get a prisonplanet.tv membership and see it all right now.
[02:56:19.366 --> 02:56:20.466]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:20.506 --> 02:56:21.467]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:21.527 --> 02:56:22.187]  God bless.
[02:56:22.627 --> 02:56:24.208]  See you tonight at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:56:26.559 --> 02:56:30.482]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[02:56:30.802 --> 02:56:31.583]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
