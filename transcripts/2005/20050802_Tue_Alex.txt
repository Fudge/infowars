[00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.512]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:08.233]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.054]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:11.515]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:33.051]  Well, my friends, I have returned from the United Kingdom, where I basically ran a sneak attack
[00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:47.748]  In the information war against the Red Coat Capital, or Airstrip One, the capital of the Oceanic, Kingdom of Oceania of 1984.
[00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:52.312]  I flew out Thursday night, got there Friday afternoon,
[00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:10.341]  And was there really a little bit less than three days, flew out in the morning yesterday, on Monday, on the first of August 2005.
[00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:14.002]  Amazing trip!
[00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:18.443]  We got so many powerful interviews.
[00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:29.886]  David Shaler, MI5 agent, said more than he's ever said to a newspaper or ever said on this radio show about government involvement in the terror attacks in the past and the present.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:39.287]  I went to the house of former Blair cabinet member, Michael Meacher, there in London, and he revealed more than he's ever revealed.
[00:01:39.307 --> 00:02:00.144]  There in his study, there in his den, as I interviewed him for several hours, and we talked to people on the ground, we talked over the phone, email and in person, with bus drivers and city workers about government complicity in the attacks
[00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:08.831]  There was just so much, and then they passed a law banning basically free speech and demonstrations.
[00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:13.613]  But that doesn't take effect until just a couple days from now.
[00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:27.522]  And so we were there in the middle of the last days of being able to protest outside Parliament, and one of the people who's been taken to court by the government had this gigantic bullhorn.
[00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:29.703]  He's also been taken to jail.
[00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:38.649]  And so I had a chance to sit there, I mean, right up against the gates of Parliament with the biggest, I didn't know they made bullhorns this big.
[00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:44.317]  The thing's about four feet long, about two feet wide, gigantic battery pack.
[00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:54.075]  I mean, it was just super powerful, blasting, taking over 10 Downing Street, taking over Parliament, thousands of people looking at us.
[00:02:54.536 --> 00:03:00.981]  The police panicked, came over and basically threatened to arrest us and gave me some type of ticket.
[00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:07.466]  And of course, the day before that, the police threatened to arrest us for just talking to people calmly on the street.
[00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:08.947]  We've got video of all of that.
[00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:11.189]  And of course,
[00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:14.587]  CAFTA passed, we're going to talk about that.
[00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.988]  That passed last Thursday.
[00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.372]  At the same time, major evidence is coming out.
[00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:29.618]  See, people are going, oh Alex, you talked about drills on the morning of 7-7 to smokescreen the government op.
[00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.826]  But oh, look, now they've found the bombers.
[00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:35.710]  Why, that proves... I said, that proves nothing!
[00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.455]  Of course, they have provocateur patsies!
[00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:44.263]  The first operation looks like bombs already planted and people taking part in some type of drill.
[00:03:46.890 --> 00:04:02.748]  And then, the second wave, looks like I said early on, criminal types hired to do it, and then that's what's coming out, and that their controller is a known MI6 asset being protected right now.
[00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.751]  Always the same.
[00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:08.094]  Look, we've got these people figured out.
[00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:10.993]  So we stayed the course with our analysis.
[00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:14.435]  Every indicator says that it was government operations.
[00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:16.837]  Believe me, I wish it was Muslims.
[00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:19.799]  I wish it was lone, turbaned idiots.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.142]  I wish that it was just a few ragtag people.
[00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:25.784]  That's a lot less scary than our government.
[00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:27.505]  Than our governments.
[00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:31.248]  Okay, but I'm sorry, it is the government.
[00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:33.129]  Believe me, I'm sorry.
[00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.253]  Believe me, I wish it was a few dozen ragtag morons.
[00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:40.769]  Killers.
[00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:41.490]  Fanatics.
[00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.690]  It's not.
[00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:47.213]  In every case, it's the New World Order.
[00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.814]  They have the motive, after all.
[00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:52.596]  Now the evidence is ironclad.
[00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.357]  No debating it.
[00:04:54.977 --> 00:04:58.099]  The London bombings and duds are all a government op.
[00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.660]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:05.507]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:21.726]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:24.769]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:29.533]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:34.137]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:41.604]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:06:03.337 --> 00:06:04.378]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.480]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.923]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:13.164]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:18.048]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:20.670]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:36.588]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.354 --> 00:08:06.378]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.060]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:18.408]  Hi, my friends.
[00:08:18.568 --> 00:08:27.055]  I am fresh back from the United Kingdom.
[00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:29.657]  We engaged in a
[00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:36.409]  Lightning Blitzkrieg raid in the Information War into the heart of the Redcoats.
[00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.071]  It is a city of death.
[00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:40.572]  It is a city of evil.
[00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:42.753]  It is a city of Lucifer.
[00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:47.476]  I have never seen more Illuminati symbolism.
[00:08:47.556 --> 00:08:50.858]  I have never seen more open worship of death.
[00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:54.521]  I have never seen more open Satanism.
[00:08:55.962 --> 00:09:01.124]  The entire place looks like the inside of the Skull and Bones tomb.
[00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:06.466]  I mean, open, giant black obelisks that say, Oh, glorious death!
[00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:08.907]  The secret brotherhood of death!
[00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:10.347]  Oh, Mithra!
[00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:13.689]  And we're talking about stuff built in the last 60 years that says that.
[00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:21.412]  And always, the goddess Mithra, riding a chariot, you know, victorious, looks down on a giant obelisk.
[00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:22.292]  It's all over the city.
[00:09:23.024 --> 00:09:33.292]  And I said, watch, you'll continue to see Mithra looking down on obelisks, and it'll always be a war memorial, it'll say sacrifice on it, and it did indeed say that everywhere.
[00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:40.058]  So there's material that I'm going to put in a film about the occult that I'm already working on.
[00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:49.305]  And then there's all the evidence of government involvement in the bombings, the latest wave, and of course the bombings of 7-7.
[00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:53.314]  A little under a month ago.
[00:09:53.334 --> 00:09:57.736]  And then there's the attack on free speech in the police state.
[00:09:57.836 --> 00:10:01.679]  Reading in their papers how they were banning free speech starting in about a week.
[00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:07.502]  Going to Parliament where they're banning free speech in the streets of London.
[00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:13.533]  No more protesting unless, you know, they give specific authorization for, say, 15 minutes a day.
[00:10:13.853 --> 00:10:15.114]  Then they say what you can say.
[00:10:15.475 --> 00:10:20.599]  And I'm having a chance to talk to the people who are being shut out and having a chance to talk on their bullhorn.
[00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:22.200]  Bullhorn Parliament!
[00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:25.123]  And have the police threaten to arrest us.
[00:10:25.743 --> 00:10:27.184]  All that video's going up.
[00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:29.887]  I interviewed MI5 agent Michael Meacher.
[00:10:29.927 --> 00:10:32.108]  He said more than he's ever said on this broadcast.
[00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:34.130]  He said more than he's ever said in a newspaper.
[00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:45.852]  And then we interviewed former member of the Blair Cabinet and Member of Parliament, Michael Meacher.
[00:10:47.753 --> 00:10:52.137]  You've got to forgive me, I feel great but at the same time I'm a bit dingy.
[00:10:52.377 --> 00:10:54.258]  I didn't sleep for a day and a half.
[00:10:54.739 --> 00:11:01.544]  I left Thursday afternoon, couldn't sleep on the way over in my luxurious coach accommodations on the 777.
[00:11:04.014 --> 00:11:19.060]  Sardine between two people, got over there at noon, worked until one in the morning interviewing David Shaler, MI5, and people on the streets and going to the bombing sites and being threatened with arrest.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.022]  Then I slept six hours after two days, literally, and just with a couple cups of coffee.
[00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:26.022]  I'm kind of proud of myself.
[00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:30.444]  Of course, the young Watson and his brother didn't whine too much until the third day.
[00:11:30.784 --> 00:11:32.485]  They still need their baby sleep.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.643]  They're kind of young whippersnappers compared to me, but I had them dragging their hind ends by the end of it.
[00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:42.604]  But they did a wonderful job.
[00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:50.989]  And so basically from sun up till late in the early morning hours, we worked like yeoman.
[00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:52.850]  And it's just a huge story.
[00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:56.152]  Paul's going to be writing three or four articles over the next couple of days.
[00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:57.873]  He's already written one.
[00:11:57.913 --> 00:11:59.895]  4prisonplanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:12:01.673 --> 00:12:13.117]  Concerning our exploits there, and his brother Steve, who I never got a chance to meet in person, just a fabulous individual, who works for PrisonPlanet and Infowars.net.
[00:12:14.177 --> 00:12:18.959]  He did just a fabulous job while we were there, and just great fellas.
[00:12:19.959 --> 00:12:24.801]  Of course, the horrible news is that CAFTA passed.
[00:12:25.521 --> 00:12:30.483]  But the good news is, I mean, we predicted it would pass, because 80 plus percent of the people are against it.
[00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:32.124]  I mean, it's gonna pass.
[00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:35.806]  You know, most of us are against gun control, so it passes.
[00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:39.527]  Most of us are against open borders, so it's in place, open borders.
[00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:43.009]  Most of us are against the National ID Card, so it passes.
[00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:47.331]  Almost all of us are against UNESCO, so Bush signs onto it.
[00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:52.933]  Almost all Republicans and Democrats were against Alberto Gonzales, so he's your Attorney General.
[00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:57.235]  Almost everyone was against it, like 90-something percent.
[00:12:57.675 --> 00:13:00.176]  Normally people are 80 percent, but it was 90-plus percent
[00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:07.428]  The American people were against the New Freedom Initiative for psychological testing for psychological drugging written up by the drug companies.
[00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:09.810]  Now going into place, but they did it.
[00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:16.195]  The good news is that most states are saying no to the implementation of New Freedom.
[00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:22.841]  A lot of states are starting to say no to the implementation of the National ID Card.
[00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:28.606]  People all over the country, states, are saying no to gun control and passing laws against it.
[00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:32.543]  There's counter laws against gun control, very close to passing Congress.
[00:13:34.384 --> 00:13:38.867]  People are pulling their children out of the public schools by the millions every year.
[00:13:39.828 --> 00:13:48.433]  We've gone from, what, 90 plus percent of people, what is it, 95 percent vaccinating their children, down to, what, 65 percent in the last three years.
[00:13:48.754 --> 00:13:55.898]  And the numbers are accelerating towards almost everyone refusing if the numbers continue for another two years in the same trend.
[00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:58.140]  People are waking up everywhere.
[00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:02.629]  You talk about government-sponsored terror and government having the motive now.
[00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:05.192]  Folks are awake and are concerned.
[00:14:06.393 --> 00:14:10.977]  But listen, our government says they're going to implement CAFTA.
[00:14:11.738 --> 00:14:20.466]  Well, they're going to have a problem because the Central American Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is dead on arrival.
[00:14:21.838 --> 00:14:31.301]  Almost all of the Central American countries, unless you're talking about Panama, which is a puppet dictatorship run by the globalists, they're saying, no, we're not going to do this.
[00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.582]  This is not good for our country or our people.
[00:14:33.982 --> 00:14:37.043]  It's only good for multinational corporations that are not free market.
[00:14:37.964 --> 00:14:40.004]  So what's our government going to have a deal with?
[00:14:42.325 --> 00:14:45.166]  You know, they got NAFTA with Mexico in 1994.
[00:14:46.387 --> 00:14:50.568]  And ten plus years later, we see the aftermath of NAFTA.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.503]  And in NAFTA, folks, I've read the subsections they've got, Codex Alimentarius.
[00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.226]  You know, they say in there they're going to restrict vitamins and minerals.
[00:15:01.686 --> 00:15:03.748]  As you know, I've read the subsection on air.
[00:15:04.348 --> 00:15:07.851]  I even heard a guest on Gary Brownfield's last Thursday before I left town.
[00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:11.794]  It was last Wednesday, reading the subsection out of NAFTA.
[00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:13.076]  I'd forgotten that!
[00:15:13.636 --> 00:15:20.742]  Here was this guest on, I think Paragon Foundation, several others, guests reading, you know, this was in there.
[00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.231]  I scribbled it down in the car.
[00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.392]  I forget the subsection.
[00:15:25.412 --> 00:15:27.934]  The point is that we've read the subsection.
[00:15:27.974 --> 00:15:31.738]  It was probably eight years ago on air, and then I heard it being read again last week.
[00:15:31.818 --> 00:15:32.819]  Oh yeah, I'd forgotten!
[00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:40.885]  They passed Codex Alimentarius, or the enacting clause for it, and even named it by name, back in 1994!
[00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:45.509]  Has it been implemented?
[00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:47.531]  Well, Bill Clinton tried to when it was passed.
[00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.432]  Remember the big stink?
[00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:51.663]  Back in 93-94 when they tried to do it, people said no.
[00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:53.343]  So let them come!
[00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:56.444]  Let the Redcoats come to Lexington and Concord.
[00:15:56.764 --> 00:15:58.245]  Let them try to take our guns.
[00:15:58.545 --> 00:16:00.005]  Let them try to take our property.
[00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:02.206]  Let them en masse try to take our children.
[00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:03.947]  Let them try to take our birthright.
[00:16:04.187 --> 00:16:07.187]  They've gotten a lot of their agenda through, but people are waking up now.
[00:16:08.788 --> 00:16:13.990]  So they can sit up there in their ivory towers all day long and say that we don't have the right to do anything.
[00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.611]  But we still have these God-given rights.
[00:16:19.338 --> 00:16:26.360]  You know, I'll use this parallel, I'll use this example, I'll use this analogy, until the cows come home, which is the best one out there.
[00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:39.205]  Just because the government said black people weren't humans, doesn't make it so, and doesn't mean they had to bend down and put the chain around their neck and pull the plow.
[00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:49.893]  Just because the government of Julius Caesar said that Germans were slaves and owned by Rome and had no rights, didn't mean they weren't human beings.
[00:16:50.474 --> 00:16:55.795]  And didn't mean they didn't have a right to fight against the centurions and their minions.
[00:16:57.355 --> 00:17:01.617]  So government can say it's God again, but it's not God.
[00:17:01.997 --> 00:17:02.977]  And let me tell you something.
[00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:10.678]  England, like nowhere else in Europe, has this worship of the monarchy.
[00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:23.449]  And to really experience it this time, to really get the gist of it, to go to the Tower and hear them badmouth William Wallace, and they've got a giant spike!
[00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:52.584]  At the entrance to the City of London, when you go across the main river into the City of London, the Old City, they have a gigantic like hundred and something foot spike commemorating the destruction and torture and how they ripped his guts out and burned his guts in front of him and chopped his head off and to go to the Tower and hear the Royal Guards bragging how they killed William Wallace and literally worshipping the Queen
[00:17:53.436 --> 00:17:55.457]  Paul Watson said, this makes me sick!
[00:17:55.877 --> 00:18:02.818]  Because we went there to cover the torture room, and this woman turns around and goes, how dare you not love your heritage!
[00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:09.520]  As if your heritage is licking the boots of a small, hereditary clique of scum!
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:22.323]  That's not what it is to be British, or to be of the tribes of the Scotties, the Scottish were originally called the Scotties, or the Picts, or any of those people!
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:38.151]  So, just to see it, you know, I'm sorry, you know, we were told because it was easier to take just the big bus tour to go to all the sites we wanted to go to, to show all the Illuminati symbolism and all the corruption, instead of just taking taxis, we just took the big bus tour.
[00:18:38.231 --> 00:18:40.192]  You could get off that bus, get on another bus.
[00:18:40.232 --> 00:18:42.434]  We rode around for like half a day on one of those buses.
[00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:49.259]  Sorry, the Queen owns all the roads in England, and she's not allowing buses to go in this area of the city.
[00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:54.606]  We're riding on the big river ride back up, because it was quicker to go that way than taking a taxi as well.
[00:18:54.646 --> 00:18:57.647]  And they're saying, the Queen allows us to use her river.
[00:18:58.107 --> 00:18:59.808]  You know, no signage allowed.
[00:19:00.168 --> 00:19:03.829]  And of course, no signage on the roads, because the Queen owns the whole country.
[00:19:04.229 --> 00:19:11.651]  But then they also own the dominant tabloids that make fun of themselves, that belittle themselves on purpose to make people not think they don't have any power.
[00:19:13.191 --> 00:19:15.652]  And just to see it, it's just so disgusting.
[00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:19.533]  Of people cowed and worshipping their government.
[00:19:20.962 --> 00:19:22.463]  That's not patriotism.
[00:19:22.483 --> 00:19:25.225]  It isn't worshipping some inbred family.
[00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:28.688]  I told that woman who got in our face in the tower.
[00:19:29.048 --> 00:19:30.749]  Then guards ran over and got in our face.
[00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.592]  How dare you!
[00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.234]  Oh, and they advised us too in the city to police.
[00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:39.856]  Listen, it is not allowed to talk about the monarchy.
[00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:47.462]  You have absolute free speech unless you speak with hate, unless you speak about the monarchy in a bad light, or unless you do anything else you don't like.
[00:19:48.189 --> 00:19:51.674]  Literally, it was just... Other than that, you have absolute free speech!
[00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:54.417]  But don't say a word about the Queen!
[00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:57.020]  Or we'll clap you in irons!
[00:19:57.641 --> 00:19:59.323]  You ravenous scum!
[00:20:01.818 --> 00:20:06.483]  Imagine enjoying your own health spa in the comfort of your own home daily at a fraction of the cost.
[00:20:06.743 --> 00:20:07.664]  No more imagining!
[00:20:07.824 --> 00:20:11.788]  It's time to experience the relaxing and rejuvenating Total Health Spa by HTE.

[00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:51.085]  The real money folks.

[00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:08.819]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:23:09.159 --> 00:23:13.181]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:22.724]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful, and health benefits that are off the charts.

[00:24:10.742 --> 00:24:12.743]  And believe me, it pertains to everything.
[00:24:12.823 --> 00:24:17.286]  It's, you know, not just my tour of London.
[00:24:17.346 --> 00:24:19.488]  It's just massive news developments.
[00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:21.790]  So many important things that happened.
[00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:27.734]  Paul Watson will be joining us to talk about it in the second hour.

[00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.109]  But here are the articles today.
[00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.491]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:45.693]  Homeland Security nets more than 500 gang members in arrest.
[00:24:48.928 --> 00:25:01.712]  Federal authorities arrested 582 alleged gang members over a two-week period, officials said Monday, targeting an estimated 80 violent groups they say have spawned street crimes across the country.
[00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:10.934]  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff called the gangs a threat to our homeland and security a very urgent law enforcement priority.
[00:25:11.054 --> 00:25:12.315]  Now let me just stop right there.
[00:25:13.775 --> 00:25:16.496]  Within two months of the first Patriot Act passing,
[00:25:18.345 --> 00:25:30.012]  Three and a half years ago, there were articles where they were using it on pot dealers, you name it, in New York, Texas, all over, and they would not get warrants to do it.
[00:25:30.632 --> 00:25:32.413]  Homeland Security would carry it out.
[00:25:33.514 --> 00:25:37.756]  They would even call some of them before magistrate courts and say, you don't get to have a jury.
[00:25:38.257 --> 00:25:40.238]  We would post these articles in horror.
[00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:44.213]  It would be in the mainstream news, but never on the nightly news.
[00:25:44.273 --> 00:25:55.918]  Then we'd see politicians up on Fox and CNN and even in congressional hearings and staged hearings going, I challenge anyone to show me one example where this has been used in a non-terror related case.
[00:25:56.458 --> 00:25:58.519]  You know you've all seen it on TV and read it in the paper.
[00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:00.279]  It's a conspiracy theory!
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.600]  Word for word.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.200]  Fathoms of Lost Liberty.
[00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:04.681]  There's no such thing.
[00:26:04.741 --> 00:26:06.061]  It's totally made up.
[00:26:07.002 --> 00:26:07.422]  Oh really?
[00:26:07.462 --> 00:26:09.563]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:26:11.192 --> 00:26:13.172]  We need to post this article in our own format.
[00:26:13.192 --> 00:26:27.955]  I notice it's just a link to InfoWars, I mean a link to Associated Press right now and in three or four days this article will go into the memory hole and we need to have it posted in our format so folks who don't believe this a year from now can read it.
[00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:38.617]  But we also need to post above it the link to the archive of Patriot Act and Homeland Security being used in non-terror related cases.
[00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:41.035]  You know, with all the articles.
[00:26:41.435 --> 00:26:44.117]  Vet complained too much, was arrested as terrorist.
[00:26:44.677 --> 00:26:49.461]  Homeland Security admits he didn't threaten anyone, but complaining hurts our homeland and our security.
[00:26:50.781 --> 00:26:51.622]  Quad City Times.
[00:26:52.102 --> 00:26:54.044]  Woman selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes.
[00:26:54.444 --> 00:26:59.207]  Visited by Homeland Security, told she'd be arrested as a terrorist if she didn't take toys off shelves.
[00:26:59.587 --> 00:27:01.629]  When she asked, is this now terrorism?
[00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:02.269]  They said, yes.
[00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:05.011]  The entire infrastructure is the homeland.
[00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:06.612]  You have endangered it.
[00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:10.377]  Folks, they're all there!
[00:27:11.418 --> 00:27:17.141]  Topless Bar owner gave a $4,000 contribution for more zoning spaces for parking.
[00:27:17.682 --> 00:27:23.525]  He was charged, not allowed to have a warrant during the search because the Patriot Act was used.
[00:27:24.146 --> 00:27:25.587]  And what article was that?
[00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:26.948]  Here's just a few of the better known ones.
[00:27:27.508 --> 00:27:28.388]  What article was that?
[00:27:29.449 --> 00:27:32.411]  That was, of course, a series of articles in the Las Vegas Review Journal.
[00:27:34.588 --> 00:27:45.174]  Listen, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, whose cousin writes hit pieces on me for Popular Mechanics, called the gangs a threat to our homeland security and a very urgent law enforcement priority.
[00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:45.534]  See?
[00:27:45.994 --> 00:27:49.456]  The homeland, folks, is going to be everything.
[00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:54.898]  And I saw Ridge, three years ago, on C-SPAN, in a two-hour meeting, say this.
[00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:58.740]  It'll be over your taxes, over your backyard.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.421]  If you cut down a tree, it hurts the environment.
[00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:02.482]  That hurts the homeland.
[00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:07.329]  If you complain too much, that hurts the government, thus hurting the homeland.
[00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:10.951]  See, stuff that isn't even normally criminal.
[00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:14.913]  See, they claim it wouldn't be used against criminal cases, only terror cases.
[00:28:15.073 --> 00:28:19.256]  And then, of course, the bills and legislation all said criminal.
[00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:22.158]  But see, now it's stuff that isn't even criminal.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:32.124]  Investigators picked up most of the offenders between July 16th and July 28th on immigration violations for being in the United States illegally.
[00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:42.024]  76 face criminal charges ranging from illegal possession of a firearm, see that's terrorism, to holding fraudulent documents.
[00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:45.170]  For far too long these gangs have gone unchecked.
[00:28:45.805 --> 00:28:57.476]  Flaunting all laws and demonstrating a blatant disregard for public safety, Cherkoff said, announcing that arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, ICE is an arm of the Homeland Security Department.
[00:28:57.776 --> 00:29:02.600]  So he says something about immigration there to make conservatives go, oh, it's those illegals.
[00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:06.704]  Folks, they do whatever they want, that's pure bull.
[00:29:07.304 --> 00:29:11.048]  I have been covering for the last three years what Homeland Security's been doing with gangs,
[00:29:11.773 --> 00:29:14.013]  It is just average criminal arrest.
[00:29:14.474 --> 00:29:21.075]  They call it a gang sweep when some 45-year-old construction worker gets caught with a pistol in his car because he lives in a dangerous neighborhood, okay?
[00:29:21.415 --> 00:29:24.176]  That's put into the gang investigation statistics.
[00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.036]  Considered a gang crime.
[00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:28.456]  So again, it's just more lies!
[00:29:30.237 --> 00:29:39.259]  Investigators targeted members of 27 states in what they considered to be the most violent street gangs, including Mara, Salventura, and MS-13.
[00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:39.399]  Bull.
[00:29:42.162 --> 00:29:45.205]  The Latin Kings, the Mexican Mafia, and the Border Brothers.
[00:29:45.706 --> 00:29:47.387]  Brown Pride and numerous others.
[00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:49.530]  Pure garbage.
[00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.190]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.012 --> 00:29:52.893]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.393 --> 00:29:54.995]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:58.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.664 --> 00:30:04.226]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:30:04.286 --> 00:30:07.868]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:30:07.988 --> 00:30:08.348]  Shocking?
[00:30:08.448 --> 00:30:08.909]  Of course!
[00:30:09.189 --> 00:30:11.250]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.312]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:15.873]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[00:30:16.013 --> 00:30:20.296]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott, PhD.
[00:30:20.476 --> 00:30:21.877]  Only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[00:30:22.177 --> 00:30:27.302]  This 150 plus page milestone gives you more for your money than any other piece of work on this subject.
[00:30:27.402 --> 00:30:40.313]  It should be mandatory in every university that teaches anything about improving your nutrition without all the potions and lotions that are sold to masks over all the problems most folks taught with resulting from the horrible things that are taught as being so good for us.
[00:30:40.473 --> 00:30:44.497]  Also, you will learn about the three foods to avoid at all costs by ordering the book
[00:30:44.497 --> 00:30:45.338]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:08.032]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.152 --> 00:31:14.334]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.614 --> 00:31:23.036]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:30.298]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.618 --> 00:31:35.441]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:41.065]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.405 --> 00:31:44.487]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or night light.
[00:31:44.808 --> 00:31:52.793]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.813 --> 00:31:53.413]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.819 --> 00:32:10.681]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.942 --> 00:32:13.302]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:15.503]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.843 --> 00:32:21.185]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.645 --> 00:32:21.946]  I think so.
[00:32:41.987 --> 00:32:45.149]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.851]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:49.432]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:32:49.653 --> 00:32:54.416]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:54.656 --> 00:32:56.998]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:57.098 --> 00:32:57.598]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:33:06.633 --> 00:33:08.554]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:09.014 --> 00:33:11.815]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.356 --> 00:33:19.877]  Alright, Joseph in England, because he's on his own dime.
[00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:23.779]  If you're calling from the McMurtle Air Station in Antarctica, you go to the head of the line.
[00:33:24.439 --> 00:33:31.441]  If you're calling from Spain or Chile, you go to the head of the line, because it's your dime.
[00:33:31.481 --> 00:33:34.342]  Then we'll go to Rick and Andrew and Terry and Regina and others.
[00:33:35.874 --> 00:33:41.640]  Before we go any further today, I just want to go back and mention this.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.523]  Homeland Security nets more than 500 gang arrests.
[00:33:45.464 --> 00:33:47.567]  I thought they dealt with terrorists on the border, folks.
[00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:51.373]  Federal authorities arrested 582 alleged gang members.
[00:33:51.413 --> 00:34:00.940]  And you read down here, the crackdown is part of the ICE's ongoing Operation Community Shield campaign targeting gang activity with other federal and state authorities.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.763]  So far, ICE has made 1,057 arrests as part of the sting.
[00:34:04.783 --> 00:34:05.063]  Now look,
[00:34:09.392 --> 00:34:11.594]  We've got 30 million illegal aliens here.
[00:34:11.914 --> 00:34:14.556]  And some of these people they're arresting are vicious.
[00:34:15.017 --> 00:34:20.341]  Cop-killing Mexican and Venezuelan and Nicaraguan and Colombian drug dealers and gangs.
[00:34:20.741 --> 00:34:21.082]  Great.
[00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:24.024]  Homeland Security is charged with terrorism.
[00:34:24.825 --> 00:34:26.366]  They're not really, but they said they were.
[00:34:27.147 --> 00:34:33.732]  And so we don't want the... we got the FBI, we got the state police, we got just all these other... the DEA.
[00:34:33.812 --> 00:34:37.575]  We do not need these slash terror cops doing this.
[00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:38.196]  Number one,
[00:34:39.804 --> 00:34:47.379]  Number two, they selectively enforce, and a lot of what they're doing is just anti-gun stuff against, you know, an old black man named Joe Brown.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:48.461]  Okay?
[00:34:49.122 --> 00:34:50.385]  Rubik's Cube sellers.
[00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:51.707]  I mean, we already went over all this.
[00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.120]  People that complain too much.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.680]  It's infrastructure protection.
[00:34:55.981 --> 00:35:10.168]  They're creating CIA liaison officers with the emergency and management centers in all the counties and cities, openly federalizing many police in your towns, giving them dual allegiances and dual powers and dual paychecks.
[00:35:11.828 --> 00:35:13.689]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:35:13.729 --> 00:35:21.373]  So just next time you hear they're not using Homeland Security or they're not using the Patriot Act against American citizens, just research this for yourself.
[00:35:23.624 --> 00:35:26.725]  And again, Chertoff warns of nuclear terror.
[00:35:26.765 --> 00:35:31.366]  Homeland Security Secretary sees WMD threat as a major concern.
[00:35:31.406 --> 00:35:32.326]  Give up all your rights.
[00:35:32.726 --> 00:35:35.307]  They're going to nuke you any minute, but the border stays wide open.
[00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:37.787]  Again, Bush wants a blanket total amnesty.
[00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:43.489]  And by the way, the head of MS-13, Los Santos, really controls the Mexican Mafia and MS-13.
[00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:47.530]  That's been in the mainstream Texas papers, mainstream California papers.
[00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:48.870]  The cops locally have said this.
[00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:51.291]  They're not allowed to go after them.
[00:35:51.311 --> 00:35:53.473]  They're blowing up cars, killing cops, shooting.
[00:35:53.733 --> 00:35:56.355]  Over a hundred have died in the last few months in Texas alone.
[00:35:58.177 --> 00:36:00.138]  Eighteen cops in the last month over the border.
[00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:02.500]  Five in the last month on our side of the border.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.083]  Five cops dead last month in Texas.
[00:36:07.924 --> 00:36:10.707]  And they're being trained at these paramilitary U.S.
[00:36:10.767 --> 00:36:13.449]  military bases, the original Los Zetas,
[00:36:14.301 --> 00:36:15.601]  We're trained at Fort Benning, Georgia.
[00:36:15.981 --> 00:36:25.363]  Now the CIA is training larger cadres to go after their drug dealing competition to make sure CIA controlled drug cartels are the only ones that get the drugs in.
[00:36:25.403 --> 00:36:28.463]  The prices are too low right now and the globalists are very angry.
[00:36:29.244 --> 00:36:33.364]  It's like they'll put warlords in control of Afghanistan so they have a monopoly over heroin.
[00:36:34.164 --> 00:36:35.085]  Same thing with cocaine.
[00:36:35.585 --> 00:36:42.906]  So when you hear they're cracking down, they're cracking down with the cops at one level on drug dealers that haven't been paying their cuts.
[00:36:45.009 --> 00:36:47.450]  On the other level, they've got Los Zetas, trained by the U.S.
[00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:48.690]  government, killing them!
[00:36:49.491 --> 00:36:50.671]  That's all this is!
[00:36:51.491 --> 00:36:57.894]  Homeland Security is one side of the anvil, and the hammer is Los Zetas.
[00:37:00.975 --> 00:37:01.855]  Hammer and anvil.
[00:37:02.235 --> 00:37:03.576]  Pressure from above and below.
[00:37:03.616 --> 00:37:04.936]  That's all that's happening here.
[00:37:06.577 --> 00:37:06.777]  Alright.
[00:37:07.317 --> 00:37:08.217]  I've said enough on that.
[00:37:10.618 --> 00:37:13.299]  London Bombing Mastermind is MI6 agent.
[00:37:14.995 --> 00:37:15.996]  Mi6 asset.
[00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:31.051]  We posted this yesterday at Infowars.com and it's become one of the biggest stories on the web right now and Steve Watson wrote a detailed analysis of this breaking news report
[00:37:32.353 --> 00:37:37.294]  Last night, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:44.757]  Terror Expert 77 Mastermind was working for British Intelligence Group, was used by Brits in Kosovo in the late 1990s.
[00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:47.678]  I'm going to play this Fox News clip later.
[00:37:47.718 --> 00:37:49.658]  Now, this had already come out in a few newspapers.
[00:37:50.058 --> 00:37:51.499]  We had mentioned it last week.
[00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:52.579]  It had gotten no attention.
[00:37:53.368 --> 00:37:57.051]  But having the video of them admitting on Fox caused a firestorm.
[00:37:57.652 --> 00:38:02.336]  Again, so much of what we do is just take stuff hidden in plain view and then point it out.
[00:38:04.017 --> 00:38:06.760]  Ever been looking for your sunglasses and they're sitting on top of your head?
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.582]  Ever been looking for your keys and they're in your back pocket?
[00:38:10.243 --> 00:38:10.843]  It's all well.
[00:38:11.043 --> 00:38:17.309]  Oh yeah, we were running drills at the exact same places, the exact same times, being bombed at the exact same locations.
[00:38:18.009 --> 00:38:19.831]  Just exact same thing, exact same day.
[00:38:21.696 --> 00:38:22.177]  Three things.
[00:38:22.237 --> 00:38:25.142]  Exact same day, exact same time, exact same place.
[00:38:25.182 --> 00:38:25.783]  It's ridiculous.
[00:38:26.264 --> 00:38:26.845]  Same targets.
[00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:27.806]  Simultaneous.
[00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:28.647]  Impossible.
[00:38:29.228 --> 00:38:30.771]  Classic MO of a government op.
[00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:32.253]  Using that as a smoke screen.
[00:38:34.337 --> 00:38:36.240]  Incomparable plausible deniability.
[00:38:37.842 --> 00:38:39.304]  And then now you have stuff like this.
[00:38:39.404 --> 00:38:45.070]  Now we have the whole archive, you know, headline, MI6 protecting Bin Laden, BBC, three years ago.
[00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:50.957]  You know, we have number three in Al-Qaeda protected by MI6 and MI6 safe house on payroll.
[00:38:51.237 --> 00:38:52.359]  You know, David Shaler,
[00:38:53.419 --> 00:38:58.380]  MI6, he's MI5, MI6 funds Al-Qaeda to carry out assassinations.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.281]  We have the Congressional Report in 1999 by Alfonso D'Amato admitting that the U.S.
[00:39:03.321 --> 00:39:08.782]  government funded Al-Qaeda $25 billion in 1998 to attack the Serbs to start that war.
[00:39:09.042 --> 00:39:10.362]  Bin Laden leading the attacks.
[00:39:10.642 --> 00:39:13.963]  I mean, everybody knows Bin Laden fought the Russians back in the 80s.
[00:39:14.023 --> 00:39:15.783]  I mean, it's the same... Folks, wake up!
[00:39:18.244 --> 00:39:20.684]  The July 29th edition of Fox News Channels
[00:39:21.539 --> 00:39:34.686]  Dayside Program revealed that the so-called mastermind of the 7-7 London bombings, Haroon Rashid Aswat, is a British intelligence asset, former Justice Department prosecutor and terror expert.
[00:39:35.127 --> 00:39:43.011]  John Lopness revealed that the so-called Al-Mujahid Haroon Group, based in London,
[00:39:43.863 --> 00:39:54.751]  ...had formed during the Kosovo crisis, during which fundamentalist Muslim leaders, or what is now referred to as Al-Qaeda, were recruited by MI6 to fight in Kosovo!
[00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:55.531]  Again!
[00:39:55.551 --> 00:39:58.193]  They weren't recruited then, they were recruited before!
[00:39:58.213 --> 00:39:59.094]  In 1979, folks!
[00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:06.382]  Anywhere they need a crisis, just like I say in Road to Tyranny, or in Martial Law, you see these guys.
[00:40:06.883 --> 00:40:11.285]  Loftus stated that back in the late 90's, the leaders all worked for British Intelligence.
[00:40:11.606 --> 00:40:17.790]  In Kosovo, believe it or not, British Intelligence actually hired some Al-Qaeda guys to help defend the Muslim rights in Albania and Kosovo.
[00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:24.054]  That's when Al-Mujarrad got started.
[00:40:24.114 --> 00:40:30.318]  So see, there's their spin, but then it admits that even weeks after the bombings, they're being protected, and that he's behind the bombings.
[00:40:33.484 --> 00:40:50.627]  We have previously revealed how former MI5 officer David Shaler has alleged, and French intel sources have corroborated, that the MI6 paid a Libyan Al-Qaeda cell £100,000 or roughly $180,000.95 to assassinate Colonel Qaddafi.
[00:40:51.367 --> 00:41:01.069]  The use of the group that has come to be known as Al-Qaeda as assets by intelligence services the world over is well documented.
[00:41:01.129 --> 00:41:01.609]  The London
[00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:13.180]  Independent also reported two days before the London bombings that MI5 had previously used the so-called Al-Qaeda operatives as informants, allowing them to be left alone as a trade-off.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:21.744]  This only came to light when Bisher al-Rari was captured by CIA and taken to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:41:21.784 --> 00:41:24.985]  The original Independent link has now mysteriously been removed.
[00:41:25.612 --> 00:41:30.216]  John Loftus went on to spell out that British Intelligence and the U.S.
[00:41:30.236 --> 00:41:35.840]  Department of Justice had protected Haroon Rashid Aswad back in 1999.
[00:41:36.521 --> 00:41:37.541]  He came to America.
[00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:46.548]  The Justice Department wanted to indict him in Seattle because he and his buddy, again we had a caller call in last Monday about this and we posted it, remember?
[00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:49.991]  Were trying to set up a terrorist training school in Oregon.
[00:41:50.652 --> 00:41:52.754]  We've just learned that the headquarters of the U.S.
[00:41:52.774 --> 00:41:57.337]  Justice Department ordered the Seattle prosecutors not to touch Oswalt.
[00:41:57.817 --> 00:42:00.319]  Apparently Oswalt was working for British Intelligence.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.142]  That's the Fox News terrorism expert.
[00:42:05.303 --> 00:42:17.112]  We have a photo of Haroon Oswalt, the so-called mastermind of London bombings, with radical cleric Abu Hazeem al-Masari in the London cab on January 20th, 1999, who our government protects.
[00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:26.414]  This information is startling and again highlights how Al Qaeda exists as an organized body only where the intelligence services have created, funded, and employed it.
[00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:37.244]  Wattness points out that several weeks before the London bombings, Oswalt was again located by the South African Intel Agency, but again allowed to slip away, this time to London.
[00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:40.187]  He was in London when stuff went boom boom.
[00:42:41.047 --> 00:42:44.571]  He was a British intelligence plant, so all of a sudden he disappears.
[00:42:44.872 --> 00:42:45.933]  He's in South Africa.
[00:42:46.213 --> 00:42:47.054]  We think he's dead.
[00:42:47.114 --> 00:42:49.137]  We don't know he's down there.
[00:42:49.237 --> 00:42:53.121]  Last month, the South African Secret Service comes across the guy.
[00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:53.902]  He's alive.
[00:42:53.962 --> 00:42:57.086]  The Brits know that the CIA wants to get a hold of him.
[00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:57.607]  That's bull.
[00:42:58.307 --> 00:42:59.088]  So what happens?
[00:42:59.248 --> 00:43:01.210]  He takes off again, goes right to London.
[00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:03.172]  He isn't arrested when he lands.
[00:43:03.633 --> 00:43:05.074]  He isn't arrested when he leaves.
[00:43:05.455 --> 00:43:06.616]  He's on the watch list.
[00:43:06.636 --> 00:43:10.640]  The only reason he could get away with that was if he was working for British Intelligence.
[00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.602]  He was a wanted man.
[00:43:12.642 --> 00:43:13.243]  That's a quote.
[00:43:13.723 --> 00:43:15.165]  They go into how he's an asset.
[00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:17.407]  These are Fox News quote.
[00:43:21.252 --> 00:43:23.753]  And I will add this note for Paul Watson and Steve.
[00:43:23.773 --> 00:43:47.162]  We need to add a synopsis at the top that states, as always, as in all other cases, they're government assets, and as we said, the first bombings of 7-7 look like it was patsies who thought they were taking part in a drill, and it looks like there were bombings inside, and then in some cases bombs under the trains, it blows up and they just blame some innocent people.
[00:43:47.682 --> 00:43:48.342]  Classic cops.
[00:43:49.187 --> 00:43:55.791]  The second wave of duds clearly links back to the semi-six asset.
[00:43:56.172 --> 00:44:00.534]  He gives duds to these people with criminal records.
[00:44:01.575 --> 00:44:02.756]  These known criminals.
[00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:03.756]  Criminal types.
[00:44:04.077 --> 00:44:05.017]  Criminal backgrounds.
[00:44:05.658 --> 00:44:07.199]  Not devout Muslim backgrounds.
[00:44:07.259 --> 00:44:09.240]  They go drop off satchels.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.281]  They're duds.
[00:44:11.261 --> 00:44:16.865]  Then they get rounded up and the guy that hires them and runs the attacks is being protected.
[00:44:17.701 --> 00:44:19.422]  Now, folks, this is admitted.
[00:44:19.442 --> 00:44:20.403]  Do you understand that?
[00:44:20.423 --> 00:44:24.226]  Do you understand this is right out in the open?
[00:44:25.086 --> 00:44:29.069]  Let's go ahead and talk to... We need to add that point at the top of the article.
[00:44:29.969 --> 00:44:31.190]  That's very, very important.
[00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:34.272]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in England.
[00:44:34.312 --> 00:44:35.093]  Joseph, go ahead.
[00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:36.554]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:36.894 --> 00:44:40.036]  Yeah, you're probably getting sick of hearing the English accent, so I'll be quick.
[00:44:40.703 --> 00:44:45.869]  Um, I'm just calling basically just to back up what you're saying about the symbolism stuff in London.
[00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:59.163]  I mean, you're certainly not kidding about that because, uh, I mean, I was there a few months ago and pretty much everywhere you turn there's snakes and skulls and you've got the London Eye, you know, dominating over the whole, sort of, city, basically.
[00:45:00.722 --> 00:45:02.864]  Well, I mean, listen, I didn't go over there.
[00:45:02.904 --> 00:45:10.913]  Just like I didn't go to New York to confront David Gergen, the Colonel Rove of four administrations, and have him blow up about rituals, which he admittedly attends.
[00:45:11.414 --> 00:45:12.295]  That just happens.
[00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:13.116]  Well, I'm in London.
[00:45:15.074 --> 00:45:15.614]  Are you still there?
[00:45:16.055 --> 00:45:16.515]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:17.055]  Okay, good.
[00:45:17.075 --> 00:45:18.116]  Your phone's cutting in and out.
[00:45:18.656 --> 00:45:20.958]  I'm in London, and always there's Mithra.
[00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:26.141]  Even the tour guides admit, yeah, that's Mithra, you know, that the Romans founded London after Mithra.
[00:45:26.381 --> 00:45:27.342]  It's in Mithra City.
[00:45:27.682 --> 00:45:36.247]  She's the big goddess, and she always looks down on a giant obelisk, black or gray obelisk, that says, Sacrifice the Glorious Brotherhood of Death.
[00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:40.530]  And then everywhere you go, black obelisk, Mithra looking down on it, smiling.
[00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.291]  Skulls everywhere.
[00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:48.488]  A giant spike saying, we killed William Wallace and we'll kill you.
[00:45:49.108 --> 00:45:51.610]  Satanic dragons everywhere guarding the city.
[00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.031]  Huge upside-down crosses and weird pentagrams.
[00:45:55.091 --> 00:45:56.532]  I mean, it was everywhere!
[00:45:56.552 --> 00:45:57.272]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.541]  No, I mean, you're certainly right.
[00:45:59.621 --> 00:46:08.627]  I mean, like I said, there's one area in particular, near the Temple Bar area, and you've got Temple Court and Temple of Mithras, all that kind of stuff.
[00:46:08.687 --> 00:46:11.869]  And I didn't even have time, because I was so busy doing interviews, to go over there.
[00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:15.191]  I mean, the point is, wherever I was, this stuff was there.
[00:46:15.952 --> 00:46:18.774]  Yeah, I mean, I think... The Knight Templars don't exist.
[00:46:18.794 --> 00:46:22.216]  They just have a giant temple right there in the old city of London.
[00:46:23.177 --> 00:46:23.337]  Yeah.
[00:46:23.357 --> 00:46:25.318]  I mean, you've got to love people, you know, they're so ignorant.
[00:46:26.007 --> 00:46:26.207]  Yeah.
[00:46:26.527 --> 00:46:30.209]  I mean, I was there for like five days and I barely scratched the surface.
[00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.411]  I mean, everywhere you go there's this symbolism.
[00:46:33.932 --> 00:46:37.374]  Even if you're not particularly into the occult, you've got to understand that these people are.
[00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:38.955]  That's the main point to emphasize.
[00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:42.096]  There's open, listen, there's open black magic symbols everywhere.
[00:46:42.136 --> 00:46:44.558]  I mean, I have purchased in my research to make
[00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:56.317]  Uh, Bohemian Grove film, Dark Secrets, and I went to the Library of Texas Mars, and there's a huge office just full of crates of this stuff, and, you know, all the weird little symbols they have, and magic, and black magic, it's everywhere!
[00:46:56.537 --> 00:47:03.180]  It's on the bridges, it's, it's, it's seals, or signets, or, I guess, satanic logos everywhere!
[00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.361]  Yeah, I mean, I was a... What do you say?
[00:47:05.421 --> 00:47:07.322]  The glorious brotherhood of death?
[00:47:08.403 --> 00:47:10.964]  And they have Mithras smiling down over it?
[00:47:12.988 --> 00:47:23.716]  I've got a neighbour who died recently, he was a 33 degree mason and luckily enough for me they were throwing out a lot of his old stuff and I was basically going through it and they
[00:47:24.386 --> 00:47:29.929]  The symbolism, it kind of ties in all the sort of secret societies that a lot of people would say are independent, but they're not.
[00:47:29.969 --> 00:47:32.270]  It's the same network, it's the same symbolism.
[00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:36.773]  Well, it's just like maybe one out of a thousand Masons or less reaches 33rd degree.
[00:47:36.893 --> 00:47:39.574]  Most of the Masons are good people, don't know what they're part of.
[00:47:39.634 --> 00:47:41.015]  I've had a lot of family that were Masons.
[00:47:41.235 --> 00:47:42.496]  They're good Christian people.
[00:47:42.836 --> 00:47:45.037]  So they hear us say this and go, we're a bunch of liars.
[00:47:45.297 --> 00:47:49.800]  But they don't know that there's 33rd degree, and then hundreds of degrees above that.
[00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.788]  They've been kept in the dark!
[00:47:52.248 --> 00:48:05.377]  And exactly, it's just like the head of the CFR is the head of the Trilateral Commission, is on the Steering Committee of Bilderberg, is on the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is on the Endowment for the Arts, is the Chairman of the Committee for the Sciences.
[00:48:05.938 --> 00:48:10.361]  Literally, it's a couple hundred people that are on the boards and the heads of everything!
[00:48:14.255 --> 00:48:22.307]  No, but you were saying that you're putting together a film, you know, that's actually going to be sort of, you know, generally focused on the occult, because that'd be a good idea, wouldn't that?
[00:48:22.327 --> 00:48:24.350]  Because, you know, I definitely look forward to seeing that.
[00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.972]  I think a lot of people, you know, would...
[00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:33.942]  Kind of like Dark Secrets, that was a good one, because it covered the Bohemian Grom aspects.
[00:48:33.962 --> 00:48:37.065]  It would be good to cover other aspects as well, like skull and bones.
[00:48:37.325 --> 00:48:45.071]  What do you think of this new revelation that the mastermind of the two waves of bombings is MI6 and openly being protected right now?
[00:48:45.091 --> 00:48:48.834]  Well, yeah, I mean, they said he was an asset, whatever the hell that means.
[00:48:49.054 --> 00:48:50.795]  And they're just not going to arrest him, sorry.
[00:48:50.815 --> 00:48:55.379]  No, I mean, it's always the same handy people that they use.
[00:48:56.289 --> 00:49:02.153]  That alone is, you know, has got to be concerning for anybody who says, you know, pooh-poohs it kind of thing.
[00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:05.194]  It's all a load of rubbish that, you know, the government would do this.
[00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:15.361]  Well... But I mean, you know, we were emailed last week a Seattle Times article from 99, where the feds were blowing up, going, this guy's got terror training camps.
[00:49:15.801 --> 00:49:17.162]  We can't arrest him.
[00:49:17.262 --> 00:49:19.003]  And the higher-ups said, no, you can't.
[00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:20.784]  You know, we have a train.
[00:49:22.697 --> 00:49:24.318]  Of this guy being protected!
[00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:30.943]  And then he's able to go out and hire some moron goons to go set off, basically, firecrackers.
[00:49:31.703 --> 00:49:34.505]  And the government clearly blew up innocent people on 7-7.
[00:49:34.545 --> 00:49:35.366]  That was a government op.
[00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:37.347]  You know, this guy wasn't even involved.
[00:49:39.088 --> 00:49:39.869]  It never ends.
[00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:44.712]  I mean, we've caught him red-handed, Joseph.
[00:49:45.352 --> 00:49:46.853]  Yeah.
[00:49:46.873 --> 00:49:47.674]  There is one last thing.
[00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:49.075]  I'll kick this off if I don't mention it.
[00:49:49.095 --> 00:49:50.656]  It's been barely covered by the media.
[00:49:51.055 --> 00:49:55.538]  I don't know if you've ever heard of a German media company, a massive company called Bertelsmann.
[00:49:56.018 --> 00:49:57.479]  Probably, you might have heard of it, you might not.
[00:49:57.499 --> 00:49:58.300]  Yeah, I've heard of it.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:09.427]  Yeah, basically they, this, well actually it was last month, it was July, they basically took over the administrative, you know, facilities of the East Riding of Yorkshire, you know, the council.
[00:50:10.851 --> 00:50:17.414]  I mean, I'm not saying it's been, you know, purposefully smoke-screened by the London bombs, but it's definitely... Well, let's be specific.
[00:50:17.434 --> 00:50:21.276]  You've got foreign private companies taking over the administration of cities.
[00:50:21.876 --> 00:50:22.056]  Yeah.
[00:50:22.316 --> 00:50:24.957]  Well, yeah, it's the East Riding of Yorkshire.
[00:50:24.977 --> 00:50:32.580]  I mean, all you have to do is type in East Riding Nazi Takeover and you'll find out a lot of things like UKIP have mentioned it, but the mainstream media haven't.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.481]  Specifically, what's been taken over?
[00:50:35.322 --> 00:50:38.966]  It's an actual section of Yorkshire.
[00:50:39.106 --> 00:50:40.427]  That's what I thought you were saying, yes.
[00:50:40.967 --> 00:50:44.050]  For those that don't know, the British wrote the book on privatization.
[00:50:44.411 --> 00:50:50.677]  All that is is the crown going, I'm privatizing, I'm going to give this to my cousin Lord Wilford.
[00:50:50.797 --> 00:50:51.998]  Lord Wilford, you get the rest.
[00:50:52.919 --> 00:50:53.579]  That's all it is.
[00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:57.703]  Government socializes the wealth to get control of it, then hands it out to their buddies.
[00:50:57.823 --> 00:50:58.384]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.284]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.464 --> 00:51:10.928]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:11.048 --> 00:51:15.411]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.452 --> 00:51:16.813]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.729 --> 00:51:18.550]  Animers!
[00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:22.815]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.875 --> 00:51:29.803]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.944 --> 00:51:31.986]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.186 --> 00:51:35.310]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccination.
[00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:42.731]  The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.931 --> 00:51:48.313]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.813 --> 00:51:52.033]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.053 --> 00:51:52.553]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.573 --> 00:51:53.874]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:52:01.616 --> 00:52:09.124]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.404 --> 00:52:20.315]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.575 --> 00:52:22.376]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.656 --> 00:52:25.979]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.299 --> 00:52:36.766]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.066 --> 00:52:37.546]  That's right!
[00:52:37.726 --> 00:52:44.848]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.148 --> 00:52:49.270]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:19.430]  I think so.
[00:53:39.005 --> 00:53:39.265]  I think so.
[00:54:15.787 --> 00:54:24.529]  Yeah, I mean, that's what mercantilism is.
[00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:28.550]  That's what they claim capitalism, you know, they claim capitalism is free market.
[00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:29.550]  It's really not, folks.
[00:54:30.552 --> 00:54:44.357]  Big, giant institutions gather around, and a fascist government with a dictator, or an oligarchy, a set of oligarchs, a group of commanders, a group of kingpins, or a royal house.
[00:54:45.597 --> 00:54:46.858]  That's what it's all modeled after.
[00:54:47.478 --> 00:54:56.441]  And then they just dole out the administration of everything to their friends and cronies, and then feed the entire wealth of the population of the country back into themselves.
[00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:05.873]  And again, when the serfs started getting out of slavery, they created communism to con the serfs back into slavery.
[00:55:06.654 --> 00:55:08.095]  And that's all they've done here.
[00:55:09.175 --> 00:55:15.540]  And yes, I was aware that they're just giving the administration of whole cities over to private interest.
[00:55:16.281 --> 00:55:21.504]  Most of our water districts, the majority owner of water districts in the U.S.
[00:55:21.905 --> 00:55:26.148]  that have governmental power, by the way, are German and Dutch companies now.
[00:55:27.455 --> 00:55:28.755]  And everything's being bought up.
[00:55:29.876 --> 00:55:33.396]  And they come in to something you paid for with your tax money that you built.
[00:55:34.056 --> 00:55:44.319]  And then the private politicians, their wives or their daughters or their cousins get $500,000 a year jobs on average with that company one day or one week.
[00:55:45.099 --> 00:55:50.340]  Sometimes they're a little less obvious, one year after they pass a law signing it over to them for nothing.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.581]  And your roads are being signed over to them right now, and most of it's foreign countries.
[00:55:56.537 --> 00:55:58.479]  Spain just bought a bunch of our roads.
[00:55:58.599 --> 00:55:59.960]  Germany, England's buying them.
[00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:02.942]  And that's just like England.
[00:56:03.162 --> 00:56:04.583]  The roads are owned by the Queen.
[00:56:05.203 --> 00:56:06.444]  The rivers are owned by the Queen.
[00:56:06.464 --> 00:56:08.185]  You pay her tolls, everything you do.
[00:56:09.126 --> 00:56:10.266]  But they don't have any power.
[00:56:10.347 --> 00:56:13.549]  No, they're just on the roads and the rivers and almost all the land.
[00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:17.211]  You know, flying over England, almost everything is green and untouched.
[00:56:18.012 --> 00:56:21.094]  Because almost no one owns land but the Queen and the Lords.
[00:56:23.067 --> 00:56:27.590]  Everybody's herded into these little compact cities, and then they own most of that land, too.
[00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:30.072]  And you pay exorbitant, outrageous prices for it.
[00:56:30.852 --> 00:56:36.176]  And there'll be families, surf families, you know, the stewards of the land that still live on the nobles' property.
[00:56:36.196 --> 00:56:38.517]  You know, they've been living there for a thousand years.
[00:56:38.557 --> 00:56:39.318]  They still live there.
[00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:40.999]  They own nothing.
[00:56:41.239 --> 00:56:42.100]  They have nothing.
[00:56:44.761 --> 00:56:47.423]  This is the new world order, and that's how we're going to live here in America.
[00:56:48.364 --> 00:56:49.605]  And they call it capitalism.
[00:56:49.945 --> 00:56:51.666]  It's really neo-mercantilism.
[00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:55.956]  You know, Mussolini said it shouldn't be called fascism, it should be called corporatism.
[00:56:56.216 --> 00:56:59.657]  Well, corporatism shouldn't be called corporatism, it should be called neo-mercantilism.
[00:57:00.037 --> 00:57:03.858]  It is a mercantile, imperially controlled system!
[00:57:04.738 --> 00:57:18.181]  But to get us into the system, they had to socialize the wealth, to get us dependent, and now that they have socialized everything in the government, now they get to privatize and hack it up, and hand it off to themselves, and claim that the government is being reduced in size.
[00:57:18.421 --> 00:57:20.662]  When in truth, the corporations are just becoming the government.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:26.581]  We'll come back and we'll go right to Rick and Andrew and Terry and Regina.
[00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:29.742]  Then later in the next hour we've got Paul Watson coming on.
[00:57:30.602 --> 00:57:31.442]  There's so much news.
[00:57:31.462 --> 00:57:39.345]  I'm going to play this clip too off Fox News where they admit that the MI6 asset who they're protecting helped orchestrate the bombings and they're not allowed to arrest him.
[00:57:39.385 --> 00:57:41.185]  Of course they can't arrest Bin Laden or this guy.
[00:57:41.745 --> 00:57:44.726]  They've done a good job for the globalists, keeping the slaves in fear.
[00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:48.980]  Before I end this hour, just briefly, my new film, Martial Law, is out.
[00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:50.421]  It is my best work.
[00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:53.362]  You're crazy if you don't get it, and it makes this broadcast possible.
[00:57:54.783 --> 00:57:59.345]  So I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com and order it via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.

[00:59:01.084 --> 00:59:02.186]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.866 --> 00:59:03.667]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.408 --> 00:59:05.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:09.854]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.174 --> 00:59:14.279]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.761 --> 00:59:18.924]  There is no dividing it!
[00:59:19.628 --> 00:59:22.811]  The British government is behind the bombings.
[00:59:23.131 --> 00:59:25.033]  Our criminal government joined it.
[00:59:25.073 --> 00:59:26.054]  The HIT was behind 9-11.
[00:59:26.194 --> 00:59:31.918]  You have the manuals, the training books, the government's own admissions of why they like to do this.
[00:59:32.699 --> 00:59:42.547]  And of course it comes out that the person they're saying is the mastermind of the last two waves of bombings in London is a MI6 asset being protected.
[00:59:42.948 --> 00:59:44.309]  They're always protected.
[00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:46.851]  Their spin is though, because they don't want them to bomb them.
[00:59:46.891 --> 00:59:47.952]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:59:49.326 --> 00:59:54.449]  So again, I believe from all the evidence the 7-7 bombings were government ops, no Muslims involved.
[00:59:55.269 --> 00:59:58.751]  They just waited until Muslims got on trains, had bombs on them, blew them up.
[00:59:59.831 --> 01:00:00.832]  The evidence shows that.
[01:00:01.552 --> 01:00:06.015]  The second wave, the duds, was meant to overshadow all the evidence coming out on the first one.
[01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:14.259]  And those were designed where they had criminal types plant duds on board, and witnesses said they were surprised by the duds going off, they ran,
[01:00:15.323 --> 01:00:15.644]  Hello Alex!
[01:00:39.811 --> 01:00:45.876]  Coast to Coast AM, tonight at 10 PM Pacific Time, 1 AM Eastern Time.
[01:00:47.377 --> 01:01:00.446]  Blitz your friends, your relatives, email contacts, message contacts, message boards with this information, and also plug Martial Law 9-11 because that is the main vehicle to keep you on the air.
[01:01:01.086 --> 01:01:08.531]  Also, does your film Martial Law 9-11 have the correction of Minoru Yamasaki?
[01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:08.952]  Yes.
[01:01:09.784 --> 01:01:10.124]  Excellent.
[01:01:11.164 --> 01:01:12.485]  Looking forward to hearing you tonight.
[01:01:13.205 --> 01:01:13.545]  All right.
[01:01:13.585 --> 01:01:14.165]  Thanks, brother.
[01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:16.066]  That's right.
[01:01:16.946 --> 01:01:18.127]  No rest for the wicked.
[01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:19.127]  And I'm wicked, folks.
[01:01:19.507 --> 01:01:23.908]  I'm trying to admit I'm wicked and not be such a fallen soul.
[01:01:23.968 --> 01:01:24.689]  We all are.
[01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:27.149]  But the truly wicked don't even know they're wicked.
[01:01:27.189 --> 01:01:28.770]  But I guess no rest for the wicked.
[01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:30.390]  I never get to sleep.
[01:01:30.851 --> 01:01:34.432]  Yes, I'm on coast-to-coast AM for three, maybe four hours tonight.
[01:01:36.084 --> 01:01:38.146]  In some time zones tomorrow morning.
[01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:43.972]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in New York.
[01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:44.753]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[01:01:45.293 --> 01:01:45.634]  Alex.
[01:01:46.074 --> 01:01:46.314]  Hi.
[01:01:46.655 --> 01:01:50.458]  I've been plugging your website for a couple months now.
[01:01:50.519 --> 01:01:51.540]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:52.881]  Not a problem.
[01:01:53.061 --> 01:01:53.942]  You're telling the truth.
[01:01:54.062 --> 01:01:55.744]  I appreciate that.
[01:01:57.092 --> 01:02:00.494]  Which is more than I can say for most of my quote-unquote elected officials.
[01:02:01.816 --> 01:02:18.089]  More to the point is I've also been using the public access, which I mentioned in the past, but as of this afternoon, you're now on for about three hours a week in Central New York for a combined potential, let's see, out of 160,000 homes, that's 230,000 people potential, plus your show 9-11,
[01:02:23.223 --> 01:02:26.567]  Well, look, you're one person, Andrew, and you have reached hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:02:26.587 --> 01:02:28.108]  I can only commend you.
[01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:31.532]  I mean, getting stuff aired in Manhattan, that's a potential of a million.
[01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:47.210]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:52.133]  I didn't include them just because of the simple fact that it's not on a regular basis.
[01:02:52.193 --> 01:02:57.616]  It's like you submit one but it takes like a month before it pays because there's so many people, you know, using it down there.
[01:02:57.976 --> 01:03:05.080]  But the idea is just, you know, by slowly... See, I was statewide but then they yanked it once I started talking about jury rights and things like that.
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.221]  You know, the powers that be don't like that sort of thing.
[01:03:08.261 --> 01:03:10.002]  But anyway, I've been out of my own pocket.
[01:03:10.042 --> 01:03:11.703]  I built myself up a nice little
[01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:17.994]  Fortune, I guess, if you will, by buying up hud houses, fixing them up, and renting them out.
[01:03:18.034 --> 01:03:26.578]  And now I'm taking the money that I swore when I lived in a tent, what I would do is commit myself, and now that I am here... You know what?
[01:03:26.818 --> 01:03:28.439]  You want to hold over and tell us about that?
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.981]  Sure if you want to, I'll tell you.
[01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:35.443]  Yeah, no, listen, it's people like Andrew who don't
[01:03:36.704 --> 01:03:40.248]  Just call into the show and, you know, talk about talking about it.
[01:03:41.169 --> 01:03:45.814]  It's the folks that become leaders and actually get out there and wake up the dumbed-down mass.
[01:03:46.194 --> 01:03:49.277]  They're saving this country and potentially this planet.
[01:03:49.317 --> 01:03:50.258]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.995 --> 01:03:57.859]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.099 --> 01:03:59.681]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.021 --> 01:04:04.707]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.047 --> 01:04:09.472]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.893 --> 01:04:14.078]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.298 --> 01:04:17.139]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:21.880]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.481]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:33.963]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:56.767]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:57.087 --> 01:04:59.869]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:04.292]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.713 --> 01:05:05.553]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.853 --> 01:05:10.437]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.917 --> 01:05:13.038]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.538 --> 01:05:28.221]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:54.494 --> 01:05:57.296]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:05:57.396 --> 01:06:02.459]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:06:02.699 --> 01:06:08.882]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:06:09.143 --> 01:06:14.746]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:06:15.046 --> 01:06:20.550]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:24.652]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:06:24.972 --> 01:06:29.935]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:06:30.136 --> 01:06:30.336]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:06:32.757 --> 01:06:36.779]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[01:06:36.939 --> 01:06:41.121]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:44.242]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[01:06:44.442 --> 01:06:49.304]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com and order today.
[01:06:49.564 --> 01:06:51.885]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be!
[01:06:54.523 --> 01:07:00.127]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.669 --> 01:07:11.054]  Alright, up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, being posted at InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net as well.
[01:07:12.055 --> 01:07:15.897]  Steve Watson's put together a good synopsis with the facts.
[01:07:16.678 --> 01:07:22.561]  Terror expert 77 Mastermind was working for British Intelligence Group, which was used by Brits in Kosovo in the late 1990s.
[01:07:24.304 --> 01:07:26.285]  We need to add this comment at the top though.
[01:07:27.305 --> 01:07:28.885]  Bin Laden was an asset.
[01:07:29.386 --> 01:07:30.646]  Used to attack the Serbs.
[01:07:30.766 --> 01:07:32.247]  Used before that to attack the Russians.
[01:07:32.527 --> 01:07:36.868]  Protected when Clinton, when the Sudanese offered to arrest him.
[01:07:36.908 --> 01:07:38.849]  Our government said no in 98, 99.
[01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:41.309]  Same thing when he was in Afghanistan in 2000.
[01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.990]  They refused.
[01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:52.372]  They've had a bunch of other Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-A-D-A members protected in MI6 safe houses before 9-11 and after.
[01:07:52.432 --> 01:07:56.433]  The BBC headline three years ago was MI6 protecting Bin Laden.
[01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:57.833]  We've got to get that linked up there.
[01:07:59.053 --> 01:08:00.574]  We've got to spell it out for people.
[01:08:00.614 --> 01:08:01.734]  All the evidence is in the article.
[01:08:01.754 --> 01:08:03.134]  We've got to spell it out for people.
[01:08:04.894 --> 01:08:07.555]  Again, as usual, classic MO.
[01:08:10.468 --> 01:08:30.413]  The person that, you know, admittedly, as the mastermind of these useful idiots, detonating duds on board all of these trains, all magically duds, just to scare people, it turns out is being protected by the British government and by our government, going back to 99.
[01:08:30.953 --> 01:08:32.414]  It's a government asset!
[01:08:32.654 --> 01:08:34.314]  The government has the motive!
[01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:37.232]  Gee, surprise!
[01:08:37.612 --> 01:08:40.854]  The one group that has the massive motive are the people behind it.
[01:08:43.236 --> 01:08:47.058]  They're banning free speech in England on the streets.
[01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:49.040]  The law is going into effect in like a week.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.201]  I went and bullhorned Parliament and that's it.
[01:08:51.421 --> 01:08:52.722]  Next time I will be arrested.
[01:08:52.742 --> 01:08:54.063]  They already tried to threaten to.
[01:08:54.783 --> 01:08:55.904]  I got some kind of ticket.
[01:08:56.124 --> 01:08:57.805]  I'm in some intelligence file now.
[01:08:58.045 --> 01:09:01.808]  We're going to tell you that whole story and everything else that happened in England and go over all of this.
[01:09:02.651 --> 01:09:04.452]  Look, some people say, the majority don't.
[01:09:04.612 --> 01:09:06.293]  Why do you talk about the bombings so much?
[01:09:07.354 --> 01:09:23.605]  Because, folks, if we don't expose who's behind 9-11, if we don't expose who was behind Oklahoma City, if we don't expose how the FBI, again, cooked the bomb, trained the driver, had their paid informant cook it for them, and then the informant said, okay, they're going to bomb it, let's bust them.
[01:09:23.845 --> 01:09:26.627]  They said, no, the bombing goes forward.
[01:09:26.647 --> 01:09:26.627]  1993.
[01:09:27.308 --> 01:09:29.009]  It's the same thing.
[01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:30.850]  This needs to be in our article.
[01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:31.790]  Same thing, 93.
[01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:34.235]  Same thing in 95.
[01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:36.016]  Same thing in 2001.
[01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.117]  Same thing now.
[01:09:38.998 --> 01:09:40.559]  It's the same M.O.
[01:09:41.059 --> 01:09:42.280]  over and over and over again.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:46.443]  Every time there's just accidentally drills going on at the exact same time.
[01:09:46.823 --> 01:09:52.507]  Every time the people are on the payroll being protected and they've got useful idiots under them who carry out the bombing.
[01:09:52.887 --> 01:09:57.690]  And then the people that gave them the money and the funding openly don't get in trouble and they'll pop up again.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.060]  We're going to play that clip later.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:01.961]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[01:10:02.501 --> 01:10:05.922]  So is Terry and Regina and many others.
[01:10:05.942 --> 01:10:07.462]  Feel free to join us.
[01:10:07.482 --> 01:10:09.383]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:09.823 --> 01:10:13.204]  Paul has the flu now.
[01:10:14.104 --> 01:10:18.386]  It just took its toll on him, he said.
[01:10:18.426 --> 01:10:21.367]  The grueling pace of being drug about by me.
[01:10:24.827 --> 01:10:28.271]  Let's see, Duke Lordly can't hang, can't keep up with the Joneses.
[01:10:28.411 --> 01:10:29.732]  I'm joking, I'm being obnoxious.
[01:10:30.273 --> 01:10:31.755]  Paul and his brother are just incredible.
[01:10:31.775 --> 01:10:32.415]  I love them to death.
[01:10:32.756 --> 01:10:33.577]  They work so hard.
[01:10:34.978 --> 01:10:38.122]  Never complaining as I ran around like a hyper bird dog.
[01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:41.565]  Literally bumping into walls, I was trying to go so fast.
[01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:44.689]  But right now,
[01:10:47.793 --> 01:10:49.114]  Oh, I'm just joking.
[01:10:50.754 --> 01:10:53.055]  Let's continue here.
[01:10:53.496 --> 01:11:09.302]  Let's go back here and finish up with Andrew Realfast in New York who says he has gone all over the state of New York and put my films and other films on TV and it's reached millions of people and he was saying that he promised himself when he was living in a tent
[01:11:10.784 --> 01:11:12.966]  And now he's become somewhat wealthy that he was going to do this.
[01:11:13.387 --> 01:11:17.370]  Andrew, please tell us about your American success story in fighting the New World Order.
[01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:24.096]  To do so would require volumes, but I'll give you the Reader's Digest version.
[01:11:25.758 --> 01:11:31.683]  What I found out was many times when I attempted to start a job, as some people find out, you just don't make it.
[01:11:31.723 --> 01:11:33.225]  Sometimes you get bankrupted.
[01:11:33.505 --> 01:11:34.846]  Forces behind your own control.
[01:11:35.487 --> 01:11:36.828]  But I never lost sight of the
[01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:42.883]  The fact that, you know, there were other problems greater than mine that still needed to be attended to.
[01:11:42.943 --> 01:11:53.668]  And I always said, you know, and worked at it by going on public access, which of course led to my not being able to get a job for a lot of places because I would be recognized.
[01:11:53.868 --> 01:11:57.590]  Not for what they disliked, but because I had just spoken out.
[01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:03.052]  And they were afraid they might lose business or advertising, you know, you name it.
[01:12:03.072 --> 01:12:03.773]  They were worried about it.
[01:12:03.793 --> 01:12:05.473]  It wasn't that it had happened or might happen.
[01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:19.833]  Well, when everybody has that attitude, you should support people who are outspoken, even if you disagree with them, because that's what makes us all free.
[01:12:20.114 --> 01:12:21.955]  That's the ether in which liberty swims.
[01:12:22.235 --> 01:12:28.800]  But, now, if I was getting what you said in the first segment, or the last segment right, though, you've then been blessed, though, haven't you?
[01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:42.359]  I had, through working then on a number of nurseries and greenhouses, I picked up a lot of skills to the point where, unlike the good old banking, if it's too hard, you're doing it wrong.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.681]  And especially making money.
[01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:50.584]  It requires more of a know-how than anything in some form and fashion.
[01:12:50.624 --> 01:12:51.664]  We could explain that all day.
[01:12:51.684 --> 01:12:52.345]  We won't get into it.
[01:12:52.385 --> 01:12:54.786]  But what happened was, I went looking for property.
[01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.053]  And I had done a lot of things.
[01:12:57.213 --> 01:12:58.094]  Helping people out.
[01:12:58.294 --> 01:12:58.974]  All my friends.
[01:12:59.054 --> 01:13:00.635]  Fixing up their houses when they bought theirs.
[01:13:00.815 --> 01:13:02.236]  So I'd learned a lot of skills.
[01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:08.119]  So I was looking for some blank land and lo and behold I just went to the HUD website just for the heck of it.
[01:13:08.179 --> 01:13:09.540]  And there was a house.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:09.941]  And it said $3,000.
[01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:14.203]  I said, well that thing's gotta be a, uh, excuse my language, but it's gotta be a household.
[01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.004]  But it would be my household.
[01:13:16.564 --> 01:13:17.805]  Well I went and I bought that house.
[01:13:17.865 --> 01:13:20.267]  Now mind you, mind you, now here's the kicker.
[01:13:21.948 --> 01:13:30.351]  Now, mind you, we're talking about the same government that loses nuclear military secrets on laptop computers and gets us $600 hammers and $700 toilet seats.
[01:13:31.211 --> 01:13:35.492]  A month later, I pulled the permits to do some of the work you need permits.
[01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:41.494]  And the gentleman behind the counter goes, so, which house did you want that for, Andy?
[01:13:41.534 --> 01:13:45.035]  And I go, well, it was a two-family, but no, I'm going to keep it as a one.
[01:13:45.055 --> 01:13:45.816]  He goes, no, no, no.
[01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:46.816]  Which house?
[01:13:47.665 --> 01:13:48.666]  So I go, what are you talking about?
[01:13:49.147 --> 01:13:54.193]  Tap, tap on the computer and a digital photo comes up and there's this big, giant mansion next door that nobody knew.
[01:13:54.374 --> 01:13:55.275]  Who owns that place?
[01:13:55.335 --> 01:13:57.938]  And I'd always think, you know, who owns this place?
[01:13:58.379 --> 01:13:59.520]  Gosh, that thing's a mansion.
[01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:04.166]  Well, the guy behind the counter goes, well, I don't know about you, but you're paying taxes on it.
[01:14:04.753 --> 01:14:05.874]  A lot never got split up.
[01:14:06.214 --> 01:14:07.815]  You won't make a big mansion next door.
[01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:12.497]  So suddenly my... Well, actually, you know, of course HUD covers the closing costs.
[01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:14.658]  The exit to the house only costs $2,600.
[01:14:14.698 --> 01:14:17.580]  So then, so at first you were politically active and lost a lot of money.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:26.185]  And then this chain of events happened and now you've bought a bunch of houses and become wealthy and you're now putting documentaries all over TV, all over New York.
[01:14:26.285 --> 01:14:29.747]  I want to commend you, Andrew, and just thank you for calling in.
[01:14:29.787 --> 01:14:32.828]  And I ought to have you on sometime as a guest to tell that story.
[01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.049]  And God bless you, my friend.
[01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:37.570]  I hate, all I can say is, I buy nothing really for myself.
[01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.751]  It's just to help educate others in many ways.
[01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:50.213]  Like I said, running the ads to let people know about, you know, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, you know, getting you on the shortwave and on the internet.
[01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:55.554]  Your videos, of course, I've made over a couple hundred copies that I've handed out.
[01:14:55.874 --> 01:14:58.175]  Lord only knows how many people have copied off the
[01:14:59.113 --> 01:15:16.351]  Well, Andrew, and again, it's people like you that are holding back the entire hordes of the New World Order, and Paul's holding, but I want to go to him, but be sure and call me back again, because I'm fully aware of folks like you that are out there doing this, and I just want to commend you.
[01:15:16.371 --> 01:15:16.831]  God bless.
[01:15:16.851 --> 01:15:18.393]  Same, and likewise.
[01:15:18.693 --> 01:15:19.374]  Take care, my friend.
[01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:22.324]  Folks, that's been my experience.
[01:15:22.344 --> 01:15:28.586]  If you're pure of heart, if you believe in what you're doing, if you ask God for guidance, none of us are perfect.
[01:15:28.986 --> 01:15:36.449]  We're all bad at certain levels, but if we try to be good and we try to do it for the right reasons and we work hard, God will bless us.
[01:15:37.589 --> 01:15:48.893]  And all these people that are losers, who are cowering and licking boots of the system and doing everything they can thinking that will get them ahead, that really doesn't get you ahead in life.
[01:15:50.353 --> 01:15:52.454]  It's going to cause the destruction of this civilization.
[01:15:52.834 --> 01:15:56.376]  Paul Watson, with the flu, joining us.
[01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:58.997]  Paul, good to have you on, my friend.
[01:15:59.577 --> 01:16:00.558]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:16:00.938 --> 01:16:02.859]  You're not too sick to do the imitation.
[01:16:02.879 --> 01:16:04.919]  They don't know who he is.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:05.940]  I'll try my best.
[01:16:07.681 --> 01:16:08.921]  We've got to tell that story later.
[01:16:09.181 --> 01:16:12.943]  Paul, we've got about three minutes to break, though, but in an encapsulated nutshell,
[01:16:14.235 --> 01:16:37.306]  Well, one of the biggest things it underlined for me was how easy it is to indoctrinate people into holding the establishment mindset by giving them the smallest amount of authority.
[01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:48.069]  Because we talk to both David Shaler and Michael Meacher who have, in their time, held positions of significant power and influence.
[01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:52.493]  But they were the nicest and most polite people you'd ever wish to meet.
[01:16:53.313 --> 01:17:04.262]  And then we try and talk to people who were given a gnat's wing of authority, the tiniest role imaginable, and yet they're the most arrogant.
[01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:05.383]  People like
[01:17:06.673 --> 01:17:18.759]  The guard at the Tower of London, who was in kind of a tourist help booth, and we're just leaving the Tower of London, which was a horrible experience in itself, which we can talk about later.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.982]  And you point the camera at him and basically say, so, you know, how's business at the Tower today?
[01:17:25.002 --> 01:17:31.825]  And he said, I do not perform for your camera, and then basically tried to stare us out.
[01:17:32.632 --> 01:17:34.854]  And then hid away in his little cubbyhole.
[01:17:34.874 --> 01:17:38.637]  And this is a guy who's supposedly employed to help the public.
[01:17:38.657 --> 01:17:45.883]  Yeah, we just paid like 20 pounds apiece to go see all their torture racks and, ah, we ripped out William Wallace's guts and burned them!
[01:17:45.903 --> 01:17:46.383]  Ha ha ha!
[01:17:46.503 --> 01:17:48.865]  The remains of all the people we killed are right here!
[01:17:48.885 --> 01:17:53.930]  And there's skulls everywhere and they have these big ravens that they keep that are hopping around everywhere.
[01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:59.274]  Oh, and the woman who got mad because you were getting nauseated just looking at it.
[01:18:00.498 --> 01:18:04.100]  Yeah, well that's when we had the coronation playing on big screens.
[01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:07.843]  And literally it was making me want to be sick.
[01:18:08.443 --> 01:18:09.284]  So I said that.
[01:18:10.105 --> 01:18:16.669]  And then she snapped and turned around and said something like, How dare you not be proud of our culture?
[01:18:17.509 --> 01:18:19.931]  And, you know, I said, well that's not my culture.
[01:18:19.991 --> 01:18:26.976]  Three centuries of pillaging, raping and brutalizing the world in the name of this degenerate family is not my culture.
[01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:31.191]  Yeah, that was a lot.
[01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:32.772]  And a lot more happened, folks.
[01:18:32.812 --> 01:18:41.158]  We're going to talk about our interview with MI5 agent David Shaler, a former cabinet member, and the Blair government member of parliament, Michael Meacher.
[01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:42.079]  Huge interview.
[01:18:42.099 --> 01:18:43.780]  They both said more than they've ever said.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.702]  And that's all going to be going on the web very soon.
[01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.383]  We're working on it right now.
[01:18:48.543 --> 01:18:49.944]  And bullhorning parliament!
[01:18:50.445 --> 01:18:52.046]  An absolute pleasure.

[01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:16.250]  We listened.
[01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:20.233]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:20:20.353 --> 01:20:21.153]  I don't know.

[01:23:02.418 --> 01:23:04.239]  All right, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:04.259 --> 01:23:08.841]  There's so much news, like Homeland Security nets more than 500 gang members in arrest.
[01:23:08.961 --> 01:23:10.542]  Oh, they deal with gangs now.
[01:23:10.602 --> 01:23:11.783]  Yes, that's terrorism.
[01:23:11.843 --> 01:23:18.806]  And we're going to play that clip from Fox News where, oh yeah, the mastermind's MI6, uh-huh.
[01:23:19.146 --> 01:23:20.027]  Or the bombings, uh-huh.
[01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:21.047]  But everything's okay.
[01:23:21.067 --> 01:23:22.528]  They've got a nice spin for you.
[01:23:23.969 --> 01:23:26.890]  That's what we've got to add to the article we've written, is explaining the spin.
[01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:28.571]  The spin is just ridiculous.
[01:23:30.349 --> 01:23:34.011]  And Chertoff saying, you know, we may be nuked any minute, give up all your freedoms.
[01:23:35.812 --> 01:23:49.861]  But Paul, finishing up with the Tower of London, because I was going to all these historical places to illustrate the enslavement, then we'll get into this headline, BBC, British authorities impose free-speech zones, and of course we just got right in the middle of all of this.
[01:23:50.522 --> 01:23:55.585]  But for those that don't understand, you're at the Tower where they kept Rudolph Hess, folks, in World War II.
[01:23:55.645 --> 01:23:57.947]  I mean, this was a functioning prison until the 50s.
[01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:25.770]  The giant complex of prisons, where they'd kill their own family members, and where in one area, they showed you where they dumped 1,500 people they'd killed, and out there on that tree, we would hang 24 people every Saturday for entertainment, and they would hang people off those chains into the Thames River, and then they would beg and plead, we would eat our lunches and drink a pint, and it was the entertainment, which it is, as he tortures now the entertainment here in America.
[01:24:27.277 --> 01:24:33.940]  And then just, and we took William Wallace and ripped his intestines out and burned them, and we bagged a piece of garbage.
[01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:37.462]  Oh, which one of these plaques worships Longshanks?
[01:24:37.922 --> 01:24:41.624]  We don't call him Longshanks, we call him Albert, or whatever his name was.
[01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:42.625]  Look at him up there!
[01:24:42.865 --> 01:24:44.866]  Look at, oh, he's so wonderful!
[01:24:45.566 --> 01:24:47.787]  How do you become one of these tower guards?
[01:24:48.047 --> 01:24:50.809]  Well, let me tell you how we become a tower guard!
[01:24:51.049 --> 01:24:51.889]  Let me tell you!
[01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:55.251]  Twenty-four years in his majesty's army,
[01:24:55.951 --> 01:25:02.614]  And we'd have crossed the Navy with not a single mark on your credit as a Master Sergeant!
[01:25:02.654 --> 01:25:03.514]  The crown!
[01:25:03.554 --> 01:25:04.214]  The crown!
[01:25:04.614 --> 01:25:08.676]  I mean, watching someone worship a family like this is disgusting.
[01:25:09.876 --> 01:25:13.297]  Well, yeah, that's exactly what it was, a big worship fest of the elite.
[01:25:14.018 --> 01:25:20.400]  They were talking about, you know, we hung, drawn and quartered him, took out his bowels and burned them.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.721]  And it was all very funny and quaint.
[01:25:23.556 --> 01:25:35.184]  And then we even dared to film the precious crown and the jewels, which was not allowed, and we had a bunch of people running around snitching on us for filming this kind of thing.
[01:25:35.924 --> 01:25:48.433]  And so throughout the entire experience, it was just a lapdog worship of royalty, and everybody was buying into it with this sycophantic attitude, and it just rubbed off everywhere.
[01:25:48.513 --> 01:25:49.794]  It was sickening.
[01:25:51.397 --> 01:25:53.559]  And see, that's how a fascist system works.
[01:25:53.639 --> 01:25:57.942]  You know, in Hitler's Germany, it wasn't just Hitler that got worshipped, anyone in a black uniform.
[01:25:58.603 --> 01:26:01.605]  See, or in a Soviet commissariat, everyone must grovel.
[01:26:03.246 --> 01:26:11.873]  I mean, obviously, you're from England, your brother lives in London, you go to London quite a bit, but... I mean, did you... I'm not tooting my horn, but when I started pointing out, alright, see Mithra?
[01:26:12.113 --> 01:26:15.156]  She looks down on the sacrifice, and then you guys started seeing it everywhere.
[01:26:15.456 --> 01:26:16.457]  Describe that for people.
[01:26:17.738 --> 01:26:18.278]  Well, yeah.
[01:26:18.538 --> 01:26:20.320]  Every single World War monument,
[01:26:21.101 --> 01:26:28.444]  Which shows dead soldiers, basically, with things like the glorious dead written on them.
[01:26:28.885 --> 01:26:36.488]  The one in Hyde Park said, the necessity of sacrifice, or something like that.
[01:26:36.568 --> 01:26:40.030]  Then it said the order of the dead, yeah.
[01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:46.373]  You had these goddesses on chariots staring down at these dead soldiers.
[01:26:46.393 --> 01:26:48.634]  And these obelisks.
[01:26:50.589 --> 01:26:52.130]  Yeah, there's a fascination with death.
[01:27:05.501 --> 01:27:09.582]  Anywhere near that amount of war memorials in any other major British city.
[01:27:09.602 --> 01:27:12.363]  There's like one in every major city in London.
[01:27:12.583 --> 01:27:20.786]  They also have kings and lords imaged as Hercules, or as Zeus, or as Achilles.
[01:27:21.086 --> 01:27:23.087]  So God worshipped two of the king.
[01:27:24.428 --> 01:27:31.470]  That's right, and then you get to the law courts, Tower Bridge, you've got gargoyles staring down and everything.
[01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:34.367]  So it's a wash with this kind of elitist thing?
[01:27:34.407 --> 01:27:36.368]  Well, huge dragons guarding the cities.
[01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:42.794]  And, uh, you know, even the tour guides tell you that Mithra, this is the city founded by Mithra, guarded by the dragon, the snake.
[01:27:43.374 --> 01:27:47.678]  But what about the giant spike celebrating William Wallace and the heads?
[01:27:48.943 --> 01:27:50.264]  Well, yeah, that's what they used to do.
[01:27:50.324 --> 01:28:03.416]  I mean, for those that see the movie Braveheart, which is more historical than what a lot of people try to say, but regardless, William Wallace was good, they killed him, they're still celebrating it 800 years later, how they killed him!
[01:28:03.436 --> 01:28:05.958]  Exactly.
[01:28:05.978 --> 01:28:08.841]  You'd think it'd be the opposite, but they were very proud of that fact.
[01:28:10.848 --> 01:28:17.651]  And obviously we wouldn't get our heads stuck on the spikes today, but it's still a law in High Park Speaker's Corner.
[01:28:17.671 --> 01:28:19.372]  You can't criticize the monarchy.
[01:28:19.432 --> 01:28:22.593]  You have total freedom of speech, but you can't criticize the monarchy.
[01:28:22.853 --> 01:28:23.533]  That's freedom.
[01:28:24.314 --> 01:28:25.374]  Yeah, oh, exactly.
[01:28:25.394 --> 01:28:27.235]  You have freedom of speech unless you speak.
[01:28:28.354 --> 01:28:29.756]  And we have all this on tape.
[01:28:30.236 --> 01:28:35.241]  You can say nothing hateful, nothing that criticizes the crown, or nothing that causes a riot.
[01:28:35.581 --> 01:28:38.324]  Other than that, you have absolute, total free speech.
[01:28:38.584 --> 01:28:41.047]  And we'll talk about free speech when we return.
[01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:45.291]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.752 --> 01:28:47.353]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:58.059 --> 01:30:59.840]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:03.703]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:31:03.983 --> 01:31:07.405]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi.
[01:31:07.565 --> 01:31:09.846]  A concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:31:09.986 --> 01:31:11.928]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[01:31:12.088 --> 01:31:15.910]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:19.933]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[01:31:20.133 --> 01:31:24.936]  All Natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[01:31:25.076 --> 01:31:30.100]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.

[01:31:50.634 --> 01:32:00.461]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:01.102 --> 01:32:03.423]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:09.086 --> 01:32:12.007]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[01:32:12.047 --> 01:32:13.748]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:13.788 --> 01:32:15.129]  We're here, folks, live.
[01:32:16.609 --> 01:32:23.532]  Coming up, we're going to be talking to Regina and Ron and Bob and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:32:23.672 --> 01:32:27.994]  Before we go back to Paul, I want to remind you that we have a great sponsor, Big Berkey.
[01:32:28.775 --> 01:32:30.355]  They have the British-made Big Berkey.
[01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:36.438]  They have the American-made black Berkey elements in a stainless model or in the Lexan model.
[01:32:37.578 --> 01:32:39.240]  And personally, I've seen the specs.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.421]  They have the university studies.
[01:32:40.941 --> 01:32:42.202]  The British Berkey is excellent.
[01:32:42.222 --> 01:32:43.803]  The American-made is even less.
[01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:45.905]  And it's even better.
[01:32:46.265 --> 01:32:48.647]  Cuts out even more to non-detectable.
[01:32:48.667 --> 01:32:51.450]  That means an electron microscope can find nothing!
[01:32:53.211 --> 01:32:54.833]  And it's made right here in America.
[01:32:54.873 --> 01:32:57.014]  They've got just several different specials.
[01:32:57.335 --> 01:32:59.036]  They've got a couple of 225 specials.
[01:32:59.056 --> 01:33:00.177]  $225 on units that at the store are $350.
[01:33:04.498 --> 01:33:06.238]  They normally sell for like $2.65.
[01:33:07.339 --> 01:33:07.839]  $2.25 right now.
[01:33:07.879 --> 01:33:08.659]  Just call them and ask.
[01:33:09.039 --> 01:33:15.521]  Or get the sports bottle that does 630 refills for only $20 if you get 5 of them.
[01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:18.781]  These filters are normally $35 at the store.
[01:33:19.301 --> 01:33:21.742]  And the elements that New Millennium uses are even better.
[01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.402]  They're even bigger.
[01:33:23.562 --> 01:33:26.623]  My sister went on a big trip to some third world country with
[01:33:27.293 --> 01:33:28.213]  Everything you can imagine.
[01:33:28.253 --> 01:33:29.974]  I forget, what is it, New Guinea or something?
[01:33:30.374 --> 01:33:37.536]  A whole school group she went with got sick except for her and her friend who had the big burpees with the little sports filters.
[01:33:38.396 --> 01:33:41.017]  Normally the little filter bottles have like a tiny little element.
[01:33:41.497 --> 01:33:44.698]  I mean, the element in these is like a third of the bottle.
[01:33:45.878 --> 01:33:46.498]  It's big!
[01:33:49.346 --> 01:33:50.366]  It really cuts it out.
[01:33:50.727 --> 01:33:51.967]  They've got a bunch of other great deals.
[01:33:52.027 --> 01:33:52.947]  Just give them a call.
[01:33:52.967 --> 01:33:53.908]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:56.369]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:33:56.569 --> 01:34:05.312]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[01:34:05.672 --> 01:34:10.494]  To take advantage of those specials or go to Infowars.com and you can get the specials right there as well.
[01:34:11.678 --> 01:34:13.980]  By the way, again, I have made twelve films.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:17.824]  I carry a bunch of other videos and a bunch of other great books and books on tape.
[01:34:18.024 --> 01:34:20.386]  Great tools to wake people up.
[01:34:20.767 --> 01:34:22.208]  Whether it's on the Second Amendment.
[01:34:22.248 --> 01:34:27.073]  We have the JPFO's incredible Second Amendment video that everybody needs to see.
[01:34:27.754 --> 01:34:31.017]  It comes with three free booklets when you order it on VHS or DVD.
[01:34:31.377 --> 01:34:32.258]  Innocence Betrayed.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:46.167]  I have the USS Liberty, Tito Howard video with all the admirals and captains and everybody about how our government set up the attack with Israel on the USS Liberty to blame it on Egypt to start World War III.
[01:34:46.507 --> 01:34:49.729]  But luckily, thank God, the ship didn't sink and the truth got out.
[01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:55.526]  It's just, those are two of the videos I carry of dozens of other titles.
[01:34:55.546 --> 01:34:56.706]  Then there's my 12 films.
[01:34:57.046 --> 01:34:59.887]  Films like Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, American Dictators.
[01:35:00.427 --> 01:35:06.389]  We've got discounts of upwards of 75% off when you get three or more of any of the 12 films I've made.
[01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:07.949]  Total free number to order.
[01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:10.750]  We're also carrying Joyce Riley's new video that's excellent.
[01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:12.630]  We just got it in, shipping now.
[01:35:13.611 --> 01:35:14.791]  It is titled
[01:35:15.675 --> 01:35:23.105]  Of course, beyond treason, about chemical and biological testing on our troops, the admissions, to show you how ruthless this government is, powerful film.
[01:35:23.125 --> 01:35:25.228]  We have them for the same price they do.
[01:35:25.248 --> 01:35:27.972]  So the toll-free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:34.085 --> 01:35:34.445]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:34.465 --> 01:35:39.367]  Or you could simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.

[01:36:26.284 --> 01:36:27.365]  The videos, everything.

[01:36:39.974 --> 01:36:41.835]  That's how you make this show possible.
[01:36:42.275 --> 01:36:44.377]  You also need to support our local affiliates.
[01:36:44.397 --> 01:36:45.738]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[01:36:46.371 --> 01:36:47.572]  They have incredible courage.
[01:36:47.592 --> 01:36:48.453]  They love liberty.
[01:36:48.974 --> 01:36:50.395]  Call and thank their sponsors.
[01:36:50.855 --> 01:36:53.238]  Buy from their sponsors if it's a product you want.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:37:01.065]  At the same time, tell folks about that local station and the type of shows, the type of broadcast they're carrying.
[01:37:01.406 --> 01:37:05.750]  If they're carrying this broadcast, chances are they're carrying another great broadcast.
[01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:07.812]  So tell folks about that local affiliate.
[01:37:08.703 --> 01:37:15.067]  Whether it's in Ohio, or California, or Texas, or Missouri, or Florida, or Illinois.
[01:37:15.487 --> 01:37:18.249]  Tell them about that affiliate, and thank those sponsors.
[01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:21.932]  Alright, let's go to Paul Watson.
[01:37:21.972 --> 01:37:24.813]  Paul, let's go through some more examples of this.
[01:37:24.993 --> 01:37:28.816]  Before we get to the bullhorning of the tower, that is going up this evening.
[01:37:30.228 --> 01:37:32.850]  We're encoding it and getting some raw clips.
[01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:36.152]  I've got like 29 hours of footage.
[01:37:36.172 --> 01:37:37.253]  That's how much we shot.
[01:37:37.553 --> 01:37:41.256]  The three of us shot 29 hours of footage in less than three days in London.
[01:37:42.076 --> 01:37:43.517]  We were very, very busy bees.
[01:37:44.118 --> 01:37:45.439]  Busy beavers as they say.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.320]  Fighting the globalists.
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.381]  But here's the headline.
[01:37:48.661 --> 01:37:51.143]  British authorities impose free speech zones.
[01:37:53.095 --> 01:37:55.378]  And, uh, this is exactly what our own government's done.
[01:37:56.078 --> 01:38:01.544]  Five anti-war activists demonstrating against a ban on all authorized protests near Parliament have been arrested.
[01:38:03.606 --> 01:38:07.110]  And, uh, folks, that just, that just happened.
[01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:11.274]  A day after we, uh, no, the day we left this was happening.
[01:38:12.195 --> 01:38:13.236]  Uh, one more time.
[01:38:14.206 --> 01:38:19.492]  Five anti-war activists demonstrating against a ban on unauthorized protests near Parliament have been arrested.
[01:38:20.053 --> 01:38:26.059]  A ban on protests within half a mile of Westminster, which have not been cleared by police, came into force at midnight.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:34.689]  However, about 50 people wearing black gags to symbolize the infringement of their right to protest have gathered in Parliament Square in defiance.
[01:38:35.316 --> 01:38:41.700]  Ministers say planned protests can be held, but the rights of protesters and workers in the area must be balanced.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:44.562]  And what they've said in the law is, you can't protest there.
[01:38:45.002 --> 01:38:55.208]  If you get a special permit for a certain time, a month before, you get like 15 to 20 minutes, no bull horns, and the cops can say if you can protest or not.
[01:38:55.708 --> 01:39:03.873]  Folks, we were at bus stops and they come over and threaten to arrest us for talking to people who witnessed the cops killing the young Brazilians.
[01:39:04.857 --> 01:39:06.618]  We would be anywhere and cops would come over.
[01:39:07.499 --> 01:39:14.223]  And then some cops, seeing the armed cops who were actually former military and weren't on power trips, would wave us over and let us take photos with them.
[01:39:14.804 --> 01:39:17.245]  So that's what tyranny is like, folks.
[01:39:17.305 --> 01:39:19.847]  It's whatever the bureaucrat wants to do, they do.
[01:39:20.708 --> 01:39:22.409]  Paul Watson, let's talk about this.
[01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:28.773]  Well, you should have heard how the BBC reported it before I left yesterday.
[01:39:29.682 --> 01:39:40.728]  They were talking to the head of this war coalition, Lindsey German, about the law which bans them from protesting within half a mile of Parliament.
[01:39:41.769 --> 01:39:46.071]  And the first words out of the BBC reporter's mouth were akin to,
[01:39:47.122 --> 01:39:51.343]  Isn't this all very silly and stupid in light of the fact of the recent bombings?
[01:39:51.404 --> 01:39:57.466]  Don't you think you're stretching the Metropolitan Police and, you know, acting against the interests of your own country?
[01:39:57.746 --> 01:40:05.408]  You gotta write an article about that, so implying that protesting aids Al-Qaeda when the lead Al-Qaeda commander is MI6!
[01:40:05.568 --> 01:40:12.871]  Yeah, so Al-Qaeda is attacking us because they hate our freedom, and yet it's the government that's taking our freedom away.
[01:40:13.971 --> 01:40:19.813]  BBC were pretty bad, but after these bombings, they've turned into the English equivalent of Fox News.
[01:40:20.493 --> 01:40:23.394]  Well, can you tape some of that for me and mail it to me, Paul?
[01:40:24.454 --> 01:40:25.854]  Well, it was on yesterday.
[01:40:25.954 --> 01:40:26.995]  I know, but you can find it.
[01:40:28.115 --> 01:40:28.875]  Something similar.
[01:40:29.675 --> 01:40:29.936]  Yeah.
[01:40:31.376 --> 01:40:37.538]  Let's spend an hour and a half on dog grooming and one 30-second bite about how we're banning protests.
[01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:38.998]  That's what I saw in the hotel room.
[01:40:40.505 --> 01:40:42.587]  Well, yeah, it was frightening.
[01:40:42.607 --> 01:40:57.461]  The fact that they had, after these failed bombings, that gave them the pretense to have the headlines, you know, bombers on the loose, which justified more stringent crackdown, then those bombers were caught.
[01:40:57.941 --> 01:41:00.944]  And the day after, the headline on the Sunday Times is,
[01:41:01.468 --> 01:41:04.769]  Now this free speech zone is the exact same thing our government's doing.
[01:41:20.458 --> 01:41:21.518]  It just blows my mind.
[01:41:34.544 --> 01:41:51.631]  About ten yards away from the entrance, talking to the fruit stand lady who witnessed him killing the Brazilian, very quietly, and the police came over, described that, then let's get into the bullhorning of Parliament, just, I guess, a day or so before it was banned.
[01:41:52.392 --> 01:42:02.016]  Well that's right, we were at Stockwell Underground Station, which was the site of the brutal shooting of de Menezes, the Brazilian,
[01:42:02.768 --> 01:42:12.278]  Who it came out, did not leap any barriers, was not acting suspiciously, was not wearing a heavy coat, he had a small denim jacket on.
[01:42:12.298 --> 01:42:15.141]  We've got to do an update on that too Paul, a two paragraph update.
[01:42:16.282 --> 01:42:19.586]  Well it was on there on Thursday but you're right.
[01:42:20.738 --> 01:42:43.796]  So we're basically filming the floral tributes, the placards, the messages, just in the corner there of the underground station, not blocking anybody, not blocking the entrance, and also, as he said, interviewing the fruit lady at the grocery store, who, by the way, suggested we should give up liberty for freedom.
[01:42:44.056 --> 01:42:46.478]  By the way, that's an exact, that's an exact quote.
[01:42:47.159 --> 01:42:48.440]  Yeah, double think.
[01:42:49.481 --> 01:42:52.562]  Um, so we're just basically filming bunches of flowers.
[01:42:53.222 --> 01:42:55.742]  We're not even filming the police who are stood there.
[01:42:55.862 --> 01:43:01.223]  And in case folks didn't hear what we just said, she said, I think it's great what the police have done in the Cockney accident.
[01:43:01.563 --> 01:43:04.524]  I think it's just absolutely wonderful what they've done.
[01:43:04.804 --> 01:43:06.124]  He shouldn't have been running.
[01:43:06.364 --> 01:43:07.764]  You know, his visa was out.
[01:43:08.044 --> 01:43:09.725]  He just, he didn't, shouldn't have done it.
[01:43:10.405 --> 01:43:13.125]  And I think we should give up our liberties for our freedom.
[01:43:13.145 --> 01:43:17.226]  Yeah, and she said she'd be happy if they killed more innocent people.
[01:43:18.092 --> 01:43:32.962]  So we were interviewing her, filming the flowers, we weren't even filming the police, and I get a very firm hand on the shoulder, certainly wasn't a tap, and the policeman says, can you follow me please?
[01:43:33.783 --> 01:43:44.791]  So I turn around, I call Alex over, and basically he said, we needed their permission to film anywhere, and so
[01:43:45.555 --> 01:43:51.679]  Now, meanwhile, literally folks, we got video of camera pods where there's like 15 cameras on it.
[01:43:52.439 --> 01:44:03.446]  Okay, I mean, literally, there's cameras all looking at us right now, and we're there, you know, and I've got my press passes, you don't even need those folks, Posey Free Country, interviewing people, and this is what's happening.
[01:44:04.347 --> 01:44:13.833]  Yeah, so we've got, you know, dozens of cameras mounted on poles, surveilling us everywhere we go, and yet we film a few bunches of flowers, and we get accosted by the police.
[01:44:14.676 --> 01:44:21.544]  So they take, they ask us why we didn't ask permission, which is not even lawful.
[01:44:21.604 --> 01:44:24.207]  So then we ask permission, and he says no.
[01:44:24.227 --> 01:44:25.769]  Well then I said, what's the law?
[01:44:26.409 --> 01:44:27.110]  I said, what's the law?
[01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:28.632]  And he goes, well, it's just not polite.
[01:44:29.092 --> 01:44:29.373]  Yeah.
[01:44:30.494 --> 01:44:32.076]  Then I said, okay, can I film you?
[01:44:32.676 --> 01:44:32.997]  Uh, no.
[01:44:34.682 --> 01:44:35.803]  Yeah.
[01:44:35.843 --> 01:44:38.805]  But at that time we went ahead and turned the cameras on and shoved them in their face.
[01:44:39.265 --> 01:44:47.431]  Well yeah, my brother was filming all of this like three yards away and he didn't even notice that until we'd nearly finished the conversation.
[01:44:47.931 --> 01:44:50.573]  But he asked for Alex's details.
[01:44:51.294 --> 01:44:54.696]  Was it just name and address so they could get you in the Interpol database?
[01:44:57.063 --> 01:44:58.084]  And then they left.
[01:44:58.624 --> 01:45:02.585]  But it was a clear intimidation tactic.
[01:45:02.886 --> 01:45:07.207]  Next day we go down to the entrance to Parliament.
[01:45:07.648 --> 01:45:13.370]  There's a little park right there with a statue of Winston Churchill and there's a few protesters out there.
[01:45:14.210 --> 01:45:16.031]  Let's continue from there and then I want to go to Coles.
[01:45:17.012 --> 01:45:22.514]  Well yeah, it was later on in the same day after we'd been to Trafalgar Square
[01:45:23.328 --> 01:45:31.375]  Made our way slowly down to Parliament Square, which is across from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, just off Downing Street, obviously.
[01:45:32.276 --> 01:45:34.538]  Ducking in and out of the rain, because it started raining.
[01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:43.285]  And so we notice all these giant placards, anti-war signs, deformed babies from the DU exposure in Iraq.
[01:45:44.246 --> 01:45:47.789]  And sitting there is Brian Hoare, who
[01:45:48.638 --> 01:45:53.942]  Has, you know, fought numerous cases for him to stay there and have his freedom of speech.
[01:45:54.522 --> 01:46:03.268]  The latest of which, he did win, but the proviso is he needs permission from the government to protest.
[01:46:03.628 --> 01:46:05.329]  So that, again, that's double thing.
[01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:12.234]  The media reported it as a victory for him, but he needs government permission to protest anywhere near Westminster.
[01:46:12.514 --> 01:46:14.335]  And they're calling it free speech zones.
[01:46:15.376 --> 01:46:15.596]  Yeah.
[01:46:17.794 --> 01:46:18.994]  Paul, try to shift your phone.
[01:46:19.014 --> 01:46:22.596]  You're a little bit off the receiver.
[01:46:22.736 --> 01:46:23.137]  Okay.
[01:46:23.217 --> 01:46:28.900]  So we interview Brian Hoar and then I hear what sounds like somebody speaking through a loudspeaker.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:37.865]  At first I thought it was some kind of fear-mongering security alert because it was quite muffled and off in the distance further towards 10 Downing Street.
[01:46:38.886 --> 01:46:43.908]  But it's actually right down the path and it's an Indian or Pakistani man
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.121]  Speaking through a megaphone.
[01:46:47.782 --> 01:46:50.744]  Now, the megaphone was absolutely gigantic.
[01:46:51.845 --> 01:46:52.746]  I know, I'm in love!
[01:46:53.826 --> 01:47:08.198]  So Alex starts salivating over the size of this megaphone, and the guy's voice is quite soft, so he's not... I mean, the points he was making were okay, and it kind of watered down, you know, left-wing sense, but not many people can hear him, because he hasn't got a loud voice.
[01:47:09.158 --> 01:47:14.743]  So, we briefly talked to him, um, Alex asked him if he can use the megaphone,
[01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:43.512]  He says yes and so Alex gets on the megaphone and proceeds to rampage through the evidence of government-sponsored terror and the creation of a police state and I was watching the people who were walking down Downing Street and you had literally lines of people frozen in their path to hear what Alex was saying and this carried on for around five minutes before the police arrived
[01:47:45.301 --> 01:48:03.391]  And so, the police arrive, without any particular reason, again, just as in Stockwell, um, first there's talk about it being too loud, again that was something made up on the spot, just the fact that Alex had a louder voice, the megaphone was at the same level.
[01:48:04.231 --> 01:48:06.933]  So then, they write Alex a ticket,
[01:48:07.717 --> 01:48:10.700]  Which is basically another intimidation tactic.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.223]  And they proceed to stay in the area.
[01:48:14.243 --> 01:48:15.424]  Yeah, they wouldn't leave us alone.
[01:48:15.444 --> 01:48:20.989]  They kept getting in front of the megaphone, which if you did that, it would go... Yeah, it was that big.
[01:48:21.029 --> 01:48:22.351]  You had to clear the area.
[01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:25.233]  Close range area for it to not feed back.
[01:48:26.595 --> 01:48:30.158]  I'm gonna divorce my wife and marry that megaphone.
[01:48:30.338 --> 01:48:32.140]  It's a joke, folks!
[01:48:32.927 --> 01:48:36.528]  So the police stayed there for an inordinate amount of time.
[01:48:36.588 --> 01:48:39.429]  And I finally said, hey, you're, you know, you're getting in our way.
[01:48:39.489 --> 01:48:39.829]  Leave.
[01:48:39.889 --> 01:48:40.269]  Stop it.
[01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:44.911]  Yeah, we were asking them what they were doing, and they didn't seem to be aware of what they were doing.
[01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:47.832]  It was simple intimidation tactic to try and make us leave.
[01:48:48.672 --> 01:48:54.874]  So finally, they leave, but Alex gets back on the megaphone for another, what was it, 10 minutes?
[01:48:56.039 --> 01:49:02.365]  And so again, we broadcast to, within earshot of Tony Blair's 10 Downing Street.
[01:49:02.385 --> 01:49:03.666]  Yeah, he lives at Downing Street.
[01:49:03.706 --> 01:49:05.128]  That's about 100 yards away.
[01:49:05.148 --> 01:49:07.610]  The Parliament, Big Ben's another 100 yards away.
[01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:18.861]  It's masses of tourists everywhere, but the point is, folks, is that imagine this Texan with this, you know, booming voice on the biggest megaphone I've ever seen, you know,
[01:49:19.621 --> 01:49:26.784]  Broadcasting against the corrupt crown, the corrupt government, exposing 9-11, exposing who carried out the bombings.
[01:49:27.305 --> 01:49:33.427]  It was the most fun I ever had as an activist, taking action against the globalists.
[01:49:34.188 --> 01:49:35.608]  You'll get to see the video tonight.
[01:49:36.789 --> 01:49:39.930]  No way the video can do justice, though, to actually being there.
[01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:41.831]  We'll come back and take calls.
[01:49:42.774 --> 01:49:49.323]  We'll tell you about the Shaler interview, the Abraham Shaler MI5, Epperson calls, and also the Michael Meacher interview.
[01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:51.045]  New revelations, folks!
[01:49:51.145 --> 01:49:51.986]  Big interviews!
[01:49:52.267 --> 01:49:53.608]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.129 --> 01:50:00.577]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.258 --> 01:50:01.979]  That's right, folks.

[01:50:29.761 --> 01:50:31.662]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:52:53.817 --> 01:52:59.682]  Folks, that's human history.
[01:52:59.862 --> 01:53:08.149]  Our powerful elites dominating and enslaving and controlling you.
[01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:14.934]  You should be able to remember that in your guts, in your bones, in your DNA.
[01:53:16.326 --> 01:53:17.767]  And you should be so angry at it.
[01:53:17.807 --> 01:53:20.769]  I mean, that's your heritage as Americans.
[01:53:20.929 --> 01:53:24.191]  And Europeans, for that matter, throwing off royalty.
[01:53:25.511 --> 01:53:27.773]  But it's the same inbred class.
[01:53:28.253 --> 01:53:37.918]  We were eating at a nicer restaurant, not that nice, breakfast bar, hotel, and they're in the elitist area where we were staying so we could cover it all.
[01:53:38.599 --> 01:53:42.621]  And there were these people next to us listening to our conversation just looking down on us.
[01:53:42.681 --> 01:53:44.442]  So I said, Hi, how you doing?
[01:53:45.129 --> 01:53:49.453]  And then they started talking to us, you know, down their noses, and then, Paul, tell them what they said.
[01:53:50.814 --> 01:54:02.584]  Well, they started talking about Austin, Texas, and they knew somebody who lived in Austin, Texas, who went by the name of something like Lord Ponsonby Smythe III.
[01:54:02.944 --> 01:54:05.286]  There was definitely something with the third on the end of it.
[01:54:05.867 --> 01:54:13.173]  So, um, the lady said that, and I think the man said, um, they won't know who he is,
[01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:17.250]  It's just they're absolute scum!
[01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:20.152]  They're just unhappy, stupid scum!
[01:54:20.172 --> 01:54:30.821]  And I'm here to tell them, and I'm sure that those are just wannabe clingers, I'm telling the scum of the world, we're smarter, we're better than you, we're good people, and you're gonna lose, and you're all going straight to hell.
[01:54:33.183 --> 01:54:34.304]  I'm sorry, they are, Paul.
[01:54:35.305 --> 01:54:39.528]  Well, they were also quite happy about the fact that Brian Hoare was gonna get kicked out.
[01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:42.691]  Oh yeah, we mentioned that to them, they were like, oh excellent, yeah!
[01:54:44.864 --> 01:54:46.245]  I know, they're a bunch of garbage.
[01:54:46.565 --> 01:54:48.406]  Regina in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:54:48.466 --> 01:54:49.266]  Go ahead, Regina.
[01:54:50.026 --> 01:54:53.528]  First of all, I'd like to thank Paul Watson for his service.
[01:54:53.948 --> 01:54:58.390]  And we need to pray for him because he's left in that pure bad of evil.
[01:54:59.211 --> 01:55:05.774]  And I just wondered if he also was noticing any restriction on his vitamins that he may very well need right now with vitamin C.
[01:55:06.664 --> 01:55:08.846]  No, they haven't put in Codex Alimentarius yet.
[01:55:09.607 --> 01:55:19.535]  Okay, they haven't put it in England, even though the European Union is... Well, I mean, look, they had Codex Alimentarius, I said this, that was in NAFTA, did you know that?
[01:55:19.976 --> 01:55:26.401]  I understand that, but what I'm saying here is, if I can somehow... You're calling it about Codex.
[01:55:26.702 --> 01:55:28.663]  Paul, have they taken your vitamins yet?
[01:55:29.464 --> 01:55:32.607]  I believe the European Union one passed 1st of August.
[01:55:33.488 --> 01:55:33.728]  Okay.
[01:55:34.338 --> 01:55:35.358]  I'm not sure though.
[01:55:35.378 --> 01:55:43.300]  Okay, so when he goes to buy something, he'll find out if nature's bounty is the only one that's suitable for him to buy.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.240]  That seems to be that.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:57.782]  But what I want to bring in, Alex, too, on that same note, because we have to keep in on this, because there's been a direct movement to disregard, try to downplay this whole situation with the vitamins being part of this.
[01:55:57.942 --> 01:56:00.582]  I was told that we didn't lose our vitamins on Monday.
[01:56:00.983 --> 01:56:02.743]  And I want to tell you where this is coming from.
[01:56:02.823 --> 01:56:03.543]  It's coming from
[01:56:04.973 --> 01:56:13.252]  Work being done through a so-called natural health group that is using information from the Congressional Review Research Service
[01:56:14.022 --> 01:56:14.843]  Do you know what I'm talking about?
[01:56:14.863 --> 01:56:22.167]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that regulatory control is coming through these international agreements, and that does affect vitamins and minerals.
[01:56:22.187 --> 01:56:23.088]  It's on the record!
[01:56:23.148 --> 01:56:27.291]  So, I mean, everybody I talk to believes they're trying to protect their vitamins.
[01:56:27.311 --> 01:56:28.772]  I mean, we've convinced them!
[01:56:29.112 --> 01:56:41.040]  Okay, Alex, but what I'm saying here is we have to pray about this because there's a direct desire to try to minimize it by way of people like the National Nutritional Foods Association,
[01:56:41.625 --> 01:56:51.835]  Uh, information from the Congressional Review Research Center, and these I understand are lawyers who actually write these bills, and so now they do not want this outcry from the people.
[01:56:52.175 --> 01:56:55.318]  Shut up, go home, take your, take your settle down medicine.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.701]  And, uh, you know, forget about what happened.
[01:56:57.721 --> 01:57:01.524]  Well, believe me, Regina, it might be the best thing that ever happened if they start trying.
[01:57:01.564 --> 01:57:03.025]  Look, I want the war to come.
[01:57:03.726 --> 01:57:04.666]  Let's get it on.
[01:57:04.966 --> 01:57:07.848]  Look, the more they move, Regina, the more people wake up.
[01:57:07.908 --> 01:57:09.169]  I mean, you know that, don't you?
[01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:11.731]  I understand, but... I mean, look, I tried to beat that bill.
[01:57:11.811 --> 01:57:13.232]  I tried to beat CAFTA.
[01:57:13.252 --> 01:57:15.554]  You know, we've done our job here, and so have you.
[01:57:15.594 --> 01:57:16.815]  You've done an admirable job, Regina.
[01:57:19.016 --> 01:57:26.242]  I understand, but FTAA hasn't passed yet, and Paul Watson is dealing with the devil, and, you know, what happens there is happening here.
[01:57:26.262 --> 01:57:27.563]  You know what I'm saying, Alex?
[01:57:27.683 --> 01:57:30.906]  Well, I'll tell you what, just stay there, Regina.
[01:57:30.926 --> 01:57:32.287]  We'll let you finish up briefly.

[01:57:56.526 --> 01:57:57.526]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.087 --> 01:58:01.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:06.373]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.777 --> 01:58:14.939]  Alright folks, we're now into hour number three.
[01:58:14.959 --> 01:58:18.860]  We're going to have Paul Watson with us for another thirty minutes or so and wide open phones in this hour.
[01:58:19.941 --> 01:58:21.882]  I've been in London the last three and a half days.
[01:58:22.142 --> 01:58:23.123]  Got back last night.
[01:58:24.603 --> 01:58:26.684]  There's several big developments we haven't talked about.
[01:58:27.104 --> 01:58:36.549]  Plus, I want to get Paul's take on the latest developments where they admit that the so-called mastermind of the last two wave of bombings is MI6 asset being protected.
[01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:38.310]  It's always the same.
[01:58:39.042 --> 01:58:42.225]  And there's a bunch of other just amazing news today.
[01:58:43.606 --> 01:58:46.048]  But right now, Regina finished up and we're going to Ron.
[01:58:46.088 --> 01:58:46.829]  Go ahead, Regina.
[01:58:46.909 --> 01:58:54.175]  I think the punchline in all this is, and when you say they get us from the bottom to the top, is that they got a little bit into the battle.
[01:58:54.195 --> 01:59:01.362]  When I say they, I'm not going to say a particular group, but if you keep your ears open, you'll hear this particular group on the radio complaining their natural health.
[01:59:01.842 --> 01:59:02.963]  Okay, they got into it.
[01:59:03.676 --> 01:59:07.439]  They tolerated the whole idea that CAFTA was a part of CODAC.
[01:59:07.619 --> 01:59:11.561]  Now that it's passed, they're demonizing those who had a problem with that.
[01:59:11.802 --> 01:59:16.084]  They're trying to take that energy and take it back to the bureaucrats who will have it.
[01:59:16.104 --> 01:59:21.168]  The dispute settlement board that's being set up, the new international authority, they have more power than the bureaucrats.
[01:59:21.768 --> 01:59:22.909]  When they're on the floor of the House,
[01:59:23.309 --> 01:59:26.070]  In Washington, they have to deal with Congress.
[01:59:45.009 --> 01:59:47.610]  You know, there are people denying that Bush wants total amnesty.
[01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:49.531]  He's been on TV saying he wants it.
[01:59:49.711 --> 01:59:50.692]  The bills are introduced!
[01:59:51.092 --> 01:59:54.013]  I don't spend all day arguing with people that deny it exists.
[01:59:54.373 --> 01:59:56.074]  Just keep repeating that it does exist.
[01:59:56.134 --> 01:59:56.654]  It does!
[01:59:56.954 --> 01:59:57.855]  And show the evidence!
[01:59:58.595 --> 02:00:00.136]  Ron in New York, you're on the air.
[02:00:00.196 --> 02:00:00.696]  Go ahead.
[02:00:00.716 --> 02:00:02.137]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:00:02.437 --> 02:00:08.840]  It was reported that there was a fire on a bus, which resulted in the closure of central London.
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:11.781]  I mean, what has it come to?
[02:00:11.861 --> 02:00:13.062]  I don't quite understand this.
[02:00:13.763 --> 02:00:25.506]  In the past, the recent past at that, when the IRA had engaged in bombing in London, the approach was to take a more focused, I guess, approach to the problem.
[02:00:25.686 --> 02:00:28.167]  And to ignore it and not fear monger and create fear.
[02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:31.008]  But when the government is the terrorist, they want to scare you.
[02:00:31.248 --> 02:00:38.170]  Now, all of a sudden, I mean, for the love of Pete, I think if a trash can fire starts in London, they close down half of the great city.
[02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:41.067]  Well, what do the British people come to?
[02:00:41.107 --> 02:00:42.268]  Don't they have any center?
[02:00:42.288 --> 02:00:48.193]  Or are they just going to continue to be... Well, no, the British people are mad, so they're going to ban protesting!
[02:00:49.294 --> 02:01:01.886]  That is the general... I mean, John Q. Public in Britain, or in London, from your experience and your trip, indicates that he knows this is a sham, or he resents... I'd say about half the people we talked to said, yeah, something's fishy.
[02:01:02.246 --> 02:01:04.448]  The other half just said we worship government.
[02:01:05.732 --> 02:01:11.435]  Even that, 50%, that's a very large number in a country that used to, you know, I mean, it went through the Blitz.
[02:01:12.176 --> 02:01:14.837]  That country went through the Blitz with... Let's get a comment from Paul.
[02:01:14.937 --> 02:01:15.177]  Paul?
[02:01:16.178 --> 02:01:26.603]  Yeah, it seemed to be split 50-50, but even with people who agreed with the government version of the bombings, every one of them said they didn't want a national ID card.
[02:01:26.623 --> 02:01:31.446]  So that's flipped from like 20% not wanting it a year ago,
[02:01:32.205 --> 02:01:34.426]  And now the latest poll said 80%.
[02:01:34.526 --> 02:01:36.946]  Everybody we talked to said no, they didn't want it.
[02:01:36.986 --> 02:01:38.387]  So it seems like 100%.
[02:01:39.707 --> 02:01:41.547]  But the fear-mongering is rife.
[02:01:41.687 --> 02:01:46.709]  The government came out today and said they were very proud of the fact that they're not profiling.
[02:01:47.889 --> 02:02:00.172]  I arrived at King's Cross station on Thursday with three giant bags and a coat, walked straight past the police and then they stop a white guy wearing a t-shirt with no luggage.
[02:02:00.876 --> 02:02:05.238]  So how much sense does that make if these bombers are supposedly really out there?
[02:02:06.219 --> 02:02:09.120]  Well, don't worry, we're gonna make sure all of you are enslaved.
[02:02:09.541 --> 02:02:10.681]  Exactly, that's what it's about.
[02:02:10.701 --> 02:02:12.662]  They play the race card whenever it suits them.
[02:02:12.882 --> 02:02:26.430]  Gentlemen, random searching is just saying, right, we're going to abuse everyone instead of a few, we're going to abuse... But here's the deal, Ron, what do you think of the development admitted that the main MI6 guy is carrying out the bombings?
[02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:27.030]  Nope.
[02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:28.851]  Here's another deal, Alex.
[02:02:29.011 --> 02:02:37.776]  What do you think of their international database of people that they don't like, they consider terrorists, and I hope that you and Paul can speak to that, because they're going to start that under the new law.
[02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:44.340]  And it may affect, I'm not saying it is, but it may affect someone like you, Alex, who's gone to London and you said you had some confrontation there.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:44.921]  Yes, yes.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.904]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.164 --> 02:02:51.746]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.086 --> 02:02:56.752]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.092 --> 02:03:01.537]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.958 --> 02:03:06.123]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.343 --> 02:03:09.184]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.264 --> 02:03:13.946]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.146 --> 02:03:18.567]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.787 --> 02:03:25.989]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:28.690]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:46.150 --> 02:03:49.411]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.471 --> 02:03:53.672]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:56.713]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.874 --> 02:03:59.274]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.474 --> 02:04:08.117]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:08.297 --> 02:04:09.658]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:09.838 --> 02:04:14.019]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:14.059 --> 02:04:14.779]  We're good to go!
[02:04:43.130 --> 02:04:44.401]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:51.049]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:52.791]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.491 --> 02:05:54.612]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.253 --> 02:05:56.074]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.814 --> 02:05:57.935]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.396 --> 02:06:02.319]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:06.723]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.425 --> 02:06:11.448]  It really lets you know what it is to be an American.
[02:06:11.588 --> 02:06:13.429]  I mean, he stood up to King George II.
[02:06:15.945 --> 02:06:21.009]  We kicked him and his redcoats out of this country because they were banning protests.
[02:06:21.049 --> 02:06:24.011]  They were trying to restrict guns, farm ownership.
[02:06:24.051 --> 02:06:27.254]  They were taxing and regulating and seizing property.
[02:06:28.155 --> 02:06:29.836]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[02:06:29.876 --> 02:06:31.137]  It's a mirror image.
[02:06:31.197 --> 02:06:32.698]  In fact, things are worse today.
[02:06:33.639 --> 02:06:35.140]  Just a few years ago it was a mirror image.
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:38.543]  Now it's worse today than what was in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:06:40.384 --> 02:06:42.386]  And nowhere in Europe is it more evident.
[02:06:43.507 --> 02:06:52.709]  The worship of the Royals and the Crown, and you know, the Queen owning the rivers, and then the streets, and everyone paying a tax to the Queen.
[02:06:53.249 --> 02:07:00.030]  Meanwhile, oh, they don't have any power over there, they don't have any, oh, she just owns half of Canada, and over half of Australia, did you know that?
[02:07:00.931 --> 02:07:06.092]  And a large portion of BP, and you know, big chains like Burger King, she just sold that back to the U.S.
[02:07:06.152 --> 02:07:06.792]  a few years ago.
[02:07:07.312 --> 02:07:08.372]  Oh, they don't have any power!
[02:07:09.972 --> 02:07:11.453]  Oh, Bill Gates is the richest man.
[02:07:11.613 --> 02:07:13.033]  That's ridiculous, folks.
[02:07:14.969 --> 02:07:18.872]  That's a fraud, and this is what tyranny is.
[02:07:18.932 --> 02:07:23.255]  Just some elite with a bunch of guys with guns telling you they're God.
[02:07:23.655 --> 02:07:29.359]  Then they institutionalize it and wear crowns and outfits and make you kneel before them.
[02:07:29.819 --> 02:07:32.021]  It's a whole science of groveling.
[02:07:33.622 --> 02:07:37.265]  I mean, Paul, I know you're British and you're proud of your great heritage, great people.
[02:07:37.285 --> 02:07:40.167]  I mean, a lot of America's background is England.
[02:07:40.207 --> 02:07:41.648]  I'm not bashing England itself.
[02:07:42.462 --> 02:07:59.335]  But the parasites that perch upon it, I mean, being in London, going to all those historical sites, interviewing all those people, having globalist minions treat you like garbage, and then how nice David DeShaler and Michael Meacham treated us, I mean, talk about that parallel.
[02:07:59.755 --> 02:08:02.377]  Then I want to get into some double-thinking examples.
[02:08:02.677 --> 02:08:06.380]  Then we'll get into MI6 being behind the bombings and start taking calls.
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:07.981]  But, I mean, let's speak to that.
[02:08:08.001 --> 02:08:10.503]  There were three big things, four things that were glaring.
[02:08:11.923 --> 02:08:18.285]  The woman at the site running the food stand, who we had seen on BBC, so we went up and talked to her.
[02:08:18.325 --> 02:08:23.246]  She was a witness to the killing, saying that, uh, give up liberty for freedom.
[02:08:23.906 --> 02:08:28.627]  Then there was the guy who said, I've never seen the cameras before, but since you point them out, I just say they don't exist.
[02:08:29.087 --> 02:08:30.688]  He actually engaged in doublethink.
[02:08:30.708 --> 02:08:31.828]  And I said, have you read 84?
[02:08:32.348 --> 02:08:33.148]  He said, no, I haven't read 1984.
[02:08:33.389 --> 02:08:36.249]  And he just said, I just choose to say it doesn't exist.
[02:08:36.349 --> 02:08:37.890]  It was actual doublethink.
[02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:38.930]  I mean, textbook.
[02:08:39.562 --> 02:08:44.844]  Then we're at a cafe, and there's literally a pod of cameras of like 15 right there, and I go, look at all the cameras!
[02:08:45.544 --> 02:08:46.925]  And the people start going, ah, shut up!
[02:08:46.965 --> 02:08:48.045]  We ought to hit you over the heads!
[02:08:48.525 --> 02:08:49.025]  So what?
[02:08:49.045 --> 02:08:49.906]  You're a weirdo!
[02:08:50.406 --> 02:09:00.309]  And then there's this huge map by the City Hall of the world, with this little bitty England on it, and I was walking on it, pointing out, you know, it's like at a park, how did this little country dominate the planet?
[02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:07.812]  And I had leaned up against a little fountain, got a little splash of water, I mean, just about the size of a baseball, on my hind end,
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:12.361]  And he said, ha ha, look at him, his hind end is wet!
[02:09:12.681 --> 02:09:19.122]  Oh, and the cops the day before, when I was bullhorning Parliament, had made fun of a little grass smear on my pants.
[02:09:19.302 --> 02:09:22.163]  So that's what, I mean, Paul, let's talk about these different things.
[02:09:23.603 --> 02:09:25.864]  Well, yeah, it's cognitive dissonance, isn't it?
[02:09:26.224 --> 02:09:31.165]  It's, um, they can't challenge the facts, so they just find anything else to attack us on.
[02:09:31.792 --> 02:09:36.616]  Like that woman in the Tower of London, you were pointing out that the royal family was German.
[02:09:36.636 --> 02:09:39.358]  She was just trying to basically run away from it.
[02:09:39.998 --> 02:09:42.400]  So in every instance we ran into that kind of thing.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.622]  Yeah, she got in our faces and said, aren't you proud of your inheritance?
[02:09:44.642 --> 02:09:45.302]  Why aren't you with us?
[02:09:45.563 --> 02:09:46.463]  You idiot!
[02:09:46.703 --> 02:09:47.204]  Fools!
[02:09:47.224 --> 02:09:48.465]  And I said, well, they're German.
[02:09:48.505 --> 02:09:49.626]  And she deep down knew that was true.
[02:09:49.646 --> 02:09:57.131]  She went, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[02:09:59.272 --> 02:10:09.769]  No, and as you mentioned the Hard Rock Cafe waiter on Park Lane, right outside there's a big nest of black cameras pointing down on the street, six of them.
[02:10:10.771 --> 02:10:12.013]  Literally ten feet away!
[02:10:12.924 --> 02:10:20.952]  Yeah, we were filming them, then we went up to talk to those people, and he said, I've been working here a year, I've never noticed the cameras.
[02:10:21.293 --> 02:10:26.398]  So then we pointed out the cameras, and he said something like, well, they don't exist to me.
[02:10:27.779 --> 02:10:29.761]  Again, complete double think.
[02:10:30.382 --> 02:10:34.606]  Well, whenever we were pointing them out, I mean, these are huge black cameras, and it's all in the film.
[02:10:35.067 --> 02:10:36.168]  It'll be in a film we're going to make.
[02:10:37.305 --> 02:10:38.527]  Exactly, it's quite frightening.
[02:10:38.547 --> 02:10:41.412]  It's like when John Carpenter was making May Live in 88.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:53.140]  In L.A.
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:11:00.323]  where he had set up all the signs saying obey, go to sleep, don't question authority, the big black on white signs everywhere.
[02:11:00.823 --> 02:11:09.826]  And what shocked him was people were walking past not knowing that this was a movie set and not even paying attention or finding the signs.
[02:11:09.846 --> 02:11:11.327]  Oh, I've got to make that point.
[02:11:11.387 --> 02:11:12.587]  I read that in movie trivia.
[02:11:12.627 --> 02:11:13.448]  Yeah, John Carpenter.
[02:11:14.188 --> 02:11:15.608]  So it's the same kind of thing.
[02:11:15.628 --> 02:11:19.650]  You're getting people indoctrinated into it to the point where it doesn't exist for them.
[02:11:22.642 --> 02:11:23.703]  We're in trouble, Paul.
[02:11:24.103 --> 02:11:28.126]  I mean, I go back to this example.
[02:11:28.206 --> 02:11:29.787]  Literally, we're not exaggerating.
[02:11:30.507 --> 02:11:33.349]  She said we need to give up our liberty for freedom.
[02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:37.352]  Yeah, she said we need to kill more innocent people.
[02:11:37.852 --> 02:11:40.894]  We said, but the guy was wearing a denim coat, that's admitted.
[02:11:40.914 --> 02:11:42.235]  She said, I haven't seen that.
[02:11:42.715 --> 02:11:44.076]  I agree with the police.
[02:11:44.116 --> 02:11:47.138]  They should kill as many innocent people as they like to protect us.
[02:11:47.158 --> 02:11:49.920]  It was scary.
[02:11:50.925 --> 02:11:54.830]  But folks, word for word, we should give up our liberty for freedom.
[02:11:56.051 --> 02:11:58.614]  Yeah, which is even worse than liberty for security.
[02:11:58.934 --> 02:12:00.776]  Because it's an even more double thing.
[02:12:02.238 --> 02:12:04.240]  And there was a few other examples.
[02:12:04.621 --> 02:12:08.785]  I mean, the folks at the cafe, you were sitting behind...
[02:12:09.824 --> 02:12:12.786]  You know, with your backs towards the table behind you with this big family.
[02:12:13.746 --> 02:12:23.913]  And you were videotaping me with the cameras right behind me, and I'm going, we're here in downtown Britain, enjoying a nice meal at a cafe, and right behind us is a giant nest of cameras.
[02:12:23.973 --> 02:12:26.354]  Most people go through their lives never noticing this.
[02:12:26.394 --> 02:12:27.175]  And they're going, what?
[02:12:27.415 --> 02:12:28.115]  What's he saying?
[02:12:28.396 --> 02:12:28.556]  What?
[02:12:28.896 --> 02:12:30.457]  Well, you see, I want to hit him over the head!
[02:12:30.517 --> 02:12:31.357]  What's his problem?
[02:12:31.377 --> 02:12:32.458]  He doesn't like our country!
[02:12:33.399 --> 02:12:38.302]  You know, oh, and the guy saying that my hind end was wet, notice...
[02:12:40.303 --> 02:12:42.204]  And he was going, that's absolute bonk.
[02:12:42.745 --> 02:12:45.087]  All I was saying is England was a world empire.
[02:12:45.107 --> 02:12:46.628]  I guess that doesn't exist either, Paul.
[02:12:47.749 --> 02:12:53.634]  No, you were making a presentation which you'd probably see on any Discovery or History Channel show.
[02:12:54.394 --> 02:13:01.180]  And the guy's scoffing and laughing and trying to argue the fact that your backside is slightly wet.
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:02.701]  So you challenge him to a debate.
[02:13:02.742 --> 02:13:07.906]  Yeah, so come over, sir, and you know, debate the facts when he goes, I don't have to debate the fact that your bleeper is wet.
[02:13:09.255 --> 02:13:09.495]  Yeah.
[02:13:09.976 --> 02:13:10.936]  So that's what matters.
[02:13:11.156 --> 02:13:13.458]  And then I didn't hear it, but you said you were running camera and caught it.
[02:13:13.478 --> 02:13:16.040]  The cops threatened to arrest us at Big Bend.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:21.424]  You said that they pointed out a tiny rash stain on my... And when I got back to the hotel, it was the size of a quarter.
[02:13:22.185 --> 02:13:22.385]  Yeah.
[02:13:22.765 --> 02:13:29.870]  And he pointed that out, that, oh, I do know, I do see... So I guess over there, it's all about lordly clothes, and they were looking up a spot.
[02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:30.491]  Lordly.
[02:13:30.811 --> 02:13:34.754]  But they probably had a lordly do that to them about a hundred times, so they were just doing it back.
[02:13:36.036 --> 02:13:39.418]  Yeah, and you were pointing out the camera was the new symbol.
[02:13:39.498 --> 02:13:42.199]  It replaced the Union Jack as the new symbol of Britain.
[02:13:43.039 --> 02:13:44.560]  And you were talking about Orwell.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.441]  I haven't heard that!
[02:13:45.481 --> 02:13:46.441]  That's a lie!
[02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:47.502]  It's a joke!
[02:13:47.582 --> 02:13:49.583]  Yeah, they didn't even know that that was a joke.
[02:13:49.643 --> 02:13:51.263]  That's the level of stupidity.
[02:13:51.824 --> 02:13:54.505]  And then you start talking about Orwell and they've never heard of it.
[02:13:55.045 --> 02:13:56.886]  I mean, they're taking that book out of the schools.
[02:13:56.946 --> 02:13:58.607]  They're taking Animal Farm out of the schools.
[02:13:58.647 --> 02:14:00.388]  So less and less people have even heard of it.
[02:14:00.988 --> 02:14:02.769]  But it's textbook!
[02:14:02.829 --> 02:14:04.249]  Give up liberty for freedom?
[02:14:06.662 --> 02:14:07.783]  I mean, oh Paul.
[02:14:08.103 --> 02:14:09.624]  Okay, let's get into the real meat and potatoes.
[02:14:09.664 --> 02:14:10.704]  I mentioned this in the first hour.
[02:14:10.725 --> 02:14:14.987]  We're going to play this clip and your calls are coming up on this live Tuesday edition.
[02:14:15.968 --> 02:14:19.550]  I want to thank Jack Blood and Erskine for sitting in for me Friday and Monday.
[02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:22.671]  And again, we'll be on coast-to-coast tonight for those that are up late.
[02:14:23.792 --> 02:14:28.535]  Those that are always here on the front lines, you know, will be up here on the front lines of the fight against the New World Order.
[02:14:30.018 --> 02:14:38.913]  On PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, Terror Expert 77 Mastermind was working for British Intelligence Group, which was used by Brits in Kosovo in the late 90s.
[02:14:39.194 --> 02:14:39.675]  But again, that...
[02:14:40.379 --> 02:14:49.605]  That headline's pretty good, but it's just bottom line, British behind, government behind terror again, you know, master bomber, MI6 agent, not even asset.
[02:14:49.985 --> 02:14:54.468]  And then they admit, Paul, that, I mean, we've got to get this story out to everybody.
[02:14:54.508 --> 02:15:00.872]  This, frankly, is bigger than the drills on the exact same morning, exact same places, exact same times, Paul.
[02:15:02.091 --> 02:15:03.753]  Well yeah, it closes the case.
[02:15:03.813 --> 02:15:04.914]  It's bigger than the drills.
[02:15:04.994 --> 02:15:11.541]  The mastermind behind both 7-7-21-7, which shows they're directly linked, is an MI6 asset.
[02:15:12.021 --> 02:15:16.025]  Obviously the real mastermind behind both the bombings is MI6 itself.
[02:15:16.245 --> 02:15:18.728]  And they're wanting to arrest him now and MI6 is saying no!
[02:15:19.898 --> 02:15:37.632]  No, meanwhile they're flying London school children to Morocco to have their genitals cut and forced to read out confessions and testify against other so-called Al-Qaeda members in court, therefore creating fake Al-Qaeda groups that didn't exist, while the real murder line is being protected.
[02:15:37.932 --> 02:15:40.054]  That's Time Magazine, by the way, folks.
[02:15:41.455 --> 02:15:42.456]  That's Time Magazine.
[02:15:42.476 --> 02:15:43.997]  Yeah, tell them about what they're doing to the children.
[02:15:45.498 --> 02:15:47.220]  They flew the guy out to Morocco,
[02:15:47.884 --> 02:15:48.805]  I don't think so.
[02:16:04.199 --> 02:16:07.602]  Leader of Uzbekistan who likes to boil people alive does.
[02:16:07.682 --> 02:16:10.064]  They just torture people, they grab off the street.
[02:16:10.084 --> 02:16:10.745]  Yeah, that's the point.
[02:16:10.765 --> 02:16:19.753]  They get a few Arabs that are on the payroll for 50 years, you could dance around, throw a few firecrackers around, they grab a couple, literally folks, it's always the same MO, retarded people.
[02:16:20.454 --> 02:16:24.757]  I mean, these Somalis is now coming out, one of them at least is retarded, and they burn them.
[02:16:24.778 --> 02:16:26.159]  I mean, it never ends.
[02:16:27.998 --> 02:16:37.447]  No, and I mean this story needs to get out everywhere because it's the biggest smoking gun yet that these bombings are the work of MI6 as we said from day one they were.
[02:16:37.787 --> 02:16:45.655]  What's more worrying about how they control these individuals is where the next terror attack is coming from because if it's in the US
[02:16:47.061 --> 02:16:59.648]  The American conservative came out and said that, quote, Vice President Cheney's office has specifically told the Pentagon that the military should be prepared for an attack on Iran in the immediate aftermath of another 9-11.
[02:17:00.608 --> 02:17:06.891]  However, that's not conditional on Iran actually being involved in the act of terrorism directed against the United States.
[02:17:07.112 --> 02:17:11.734]  So before it was trying to claim Iraq was, we know it's a lie, now they say that doesn't even matter!
[02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:16.912]  You know, if Russia attacks us, we're going to attack Mexico.
[02:17:17.732 --> 02:17:26.838]  Yeah, and that's a former CIA agent writing an article pointing out that they need a pretext to get the next attack going, and it's the American conservative magazine.
[02:17:27.279 --> 02:17:29.480]  We've got to get all this out now, Paul.
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.281]  I mean, it's all coming down.
[02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:33.543]  I want to come back and play this clip.
[02:17:34.778 --> 02:17:38.026]  Uh, from Fox News, where they just admit it, but then try to spin it.
[02:17:38.547 --> 02:17:40.893]  Talk with Paul a little bit more, and then take some of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:17:46.523 --> 02:17:49.566]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[02:17:49.787 --> 02:17:51.588]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[02:17:51.789 --> 02:17:55.452]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:17:55.733 --> 02:18:01.599]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:18:01.719 --> 02:18:03.661]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[02:18:03.821 --> 02:18:07.685]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:18:08.005 --> 02:18:11.689]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[02:18:11.869 --> 02:18:16.694]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.

[02:19:46.292 --> 02:19:49.955]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:19:50.355 --> 02:19:55.799]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.341]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:19:57.361 --> 02:20:01.404]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:20:02.064 --> 02:20:15.372]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:20:15.392 --> 02:20:21.195]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[02:21:57.937 --> 02:22:02.479]  Well, we got national groups running ads for Hillary to run for president, for Arnold to run for president.
[02:22:03.019 --> 02:22:03.959]  Shaping up nicely.
[02:22:03.979 --> 02:22:06.220]  Paul, let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:09.981]  London bombings mastermind is MI6 asset.
[02:22:10.541 --> 02:22:21.905]  On Fox News Channel's Dayside, terrorism expert John Lopp has revealed that Haroon Rashid Aswat, the suspect wanted by British police for masterminding the July 7th London bombings,
[02:22:23.445 --> 02:22:36.468]  And July 21st attempted bombings is, in fact, an asset of MI6, the British Secret Service, according to Lawtice, a lot has been under the protection of MI6 for many years, so... And he'll probably be bombing us again in a few more years.
[02:22:36.528 --> 02:22:39.749]  He'll probably live at home in London, be out, you know, eating dinner openly.
[02:22:40.829 --> 02:22:41.950]  Oh, hello, terrorist.
[02:22:42.010 --> 02:22:42.710]  Ah, good to see you.
[02:22:43.210 --> 02:22:45.190]  Meanwhile, the public's being run through checkpoints.
[02:22:45.770 --> 02:22:52.212]  Here's that Fox News propaganda clip, because they have to admit this, because it's now in the British papers, but they try to put a spin on it.
[02:22:53.354 --> 02:22:55.138]  You know, reasons why they do this.
[02:22:55.158 --> 02:22:55.880]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:22:56.481 --> 02:22:59.408]  A SWAT is believed to be the mastermind.
[02:23:00.169 --> 02:23:05.472]  Of all the bombings in London, on the 7-7 and 7-21, this is the guy, we think.
[02:23:05.952 --> 02:23:17.118]  This is THE guy, and what's really embarrassing is that the entire British police are out chasing him, and one wing of the British government, MI6, or the British Secret Service, has been hiding him.
[02:23:17.578 --> 02:23:22.340]  And this has been a real source of contention between CIA, Justice Department, and Britain.
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:23.041]  Hold on, John.
[02:23:23.181 --> 02:23:24.421]  MI6 has been hiding him.
[02:23:24.442 --> 02:23:27.083]  Are you saying that he has been working for them?
[02:23:28.290 --> 02:23:29.211]  Oh, I'm not saying it.
[02:23:29.551 --> 02:23:34.073]  This is what the Muslim Sheikh said in an interview in a British newspaper back in 2001.
[02:23:34.113 --> 02:23:35.854]  So he's a double agent?
[02:23:36.214 --> 02:23:36.494]  Or what?
[02:23:36.514 --> 02:23:37.594]  He's a double agent.
[02:23:38.915 --> 02:23:44.258]  So he's working for the Brits to try to give them information about Al-Qaeda, but in reality he's still an Al-Qaeda operative?
[02:23:45.018 --> 02:23:45.198]  Yeah.
[02:23:45.718 --> 02:23:56.063]  The CIA and the Israelis all accused MI6 of letting all these terrorists live in London, not because they were getting Al-Qaeda information, but for appeasement.
[02:23:56.681 --> 02:23:59.483]  It was one of those, you leave us alone and we leave you alone kind of things.
[02:23:59.723 --> 02:24:01.364]  Well, we left him alone too long then.
[02:24:02.285 --> 02:24:02.905]  Absolutely.
[02:24:03.065 --> 02:24:04.847]  Now, we knew about this guy Oswalt.
[02:24:05.347 --> 02:24:07.448]  Back in 1999, he came to America.
[02:24:07.869 --> 02:24:14.673]  The Justice Department wanted to indict him in Seattle because him and his buddy were trying to set up a terrorist training school in Oregon.
[02:24:14.733 --> 02:24:16.074]  So they indicted the buddy, right?
[02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:17.255]  But why didn't they indict him?
[02:24:18.076 --> 02:24:19.897]  Well, it comes out, we've just learned,
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:22.362]  That the headquarters of the U.S.
[02:24:22.382 --> 02:24:27.126]  Justice Department ordered the Seattle prosecutors not to touch Oswalt.
[02:24:27.206 --> 02:24:27.987]  Hello!
[02:24:28.187 --> 02:24:29.608]  Now hold on.
[02:24:29.628 --> 02:24:29.868]  Why?
[02:24:30.709 --> 02:24:33.672]  Well, apparently Oswalt was working for British Intelligence.
[02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:40.378]  Now Oswalt's boss, the one-armed Captain Hook, he gets indicted two years later.
[02:24:41.038 --> 02:24:44.141]  So the guy above him and below him get indicted, but not Oswalt.
[02:24:44.981 --> 02:24:46.942]  Now, there's a split of opinion within U.S.
[02:24:46.982 --> 02:24:47.442]  intelligence.
[02:24:47.482 --> 02:24:50.444]  Some people say that the British intelligence fibbed to us.
[02:24:50.584 --> 02:24:52.345]  They told us that Aswat was dead.
[02:24:52.965 --> 02:24:55.167]  And that's why the New York group dropped the case.
[02:24:55.747 --> 02:24:57.728]  That's not what most of the Justice Department thinks.
[02:24:57.928 --> 02:25:05.652]  They think that it was just, again, covering up for this very publicly affiliated guy with Alamujarov, who's a British intelligence plant.
[02:25:06.212 --> 02:25:06.933]  So all of a sudden,
[02:25:07.947 --> 02:25:08.688]  He disappears.
[02:25:08.708 --> 02:25:09.910]  He's in South Africa.
[02:25:10.270 --> 02:25:11.091]  We think he's dead.
[02:25:11.111 --> 02:25:11.972]  We don't know he's down there.
[02:25:12.433 --> 02:25:16.017]  Last month, the South African Secret Service come across the guy.
[02:25:16.037 --> 02:25:17.219]  Yeah, and our CIA says he's alive.
[02:25:17.239 --> 02:25:17.920]  Oh, he's alive?
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:20.302]  Our CIA says, okay, let's arrest him.
[02:25:20.503 --> 02:25:21.744]  But the Brits say no again?
[02:25:21.764 --> 02:25:23.627]  The Brits say no.
[02:25:24.227 --> 02:25:25.409]  Now, at this point,
[02:25:26.218 --> 02:25:30.880]  Two weeks ago, the Brits know that the CIA wants to get a hold of Haroon.
[02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:31.500]  So what happens?
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:32.680]  He takes off again.
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:34.101]  Goes right to London.
[02:25:34.481 --> 02:25:35.761]  He isn't arrested when he lands.
[02:25:36.181 --> 02:25:37.302]  He isn't arrested when he leaves.
[02:25:37.322 --> 02:25:38.502]  Even though he's on a watch list.
[02:25:39.122 --> 02:25:40.183]  He's on a watch list!
[02:25:40.743 --> 02:25:44.224]  The only reason he could get away with that was if he was working for British Intelligence.
[02:25:44.564 --> 02:25:45.624]  He was a wanted man.
[02:25:46.125 --> 02:25:49.826]  And then takes off the day before the bombing, as I understand it, and goes to Pakistan.
[02:25:49.846 --> 02:25:50.746]  Pakistan is arresting him.
[02:25:50.926 --> 02:25:51.806]  They jail him.
[02:25:52.567 --> 02:25:53.227]  They jail him.
[02:25:54.039 --> 02:26:01.163]  He's released within 24 hours, back to Southern Africa, goes through Zimbabwe and is arrested in Zambia.
[02:26:01.504 --> 02:26:03.185]  Now the U.S.
[02:26:03.205 --> 02:26:04.566]  We're trying to get our hands on this guy.
[02:26:05.566 --> 02:26:07.127]  John, hang around.
[02:26:07.527 --> 02:26:09.629]  I have so many questions now.
[02:26:09.729 --> 02:26:10.749]  This is a bad one.
[02:26:11.810 --> 02:26:15.112]  Alright, so, and then they spin this whole big
[02:26:17.173 --> 02:26:19.734]  piece of garbage they're trying to feed us.
[02:26:20.334 --> 02:26:21.995]  Our government never wanted this guy.
[02:26:22.635 --> 02:26:28.318]  Every time our agents throw fits about it, they'll let him go in and sting some innocent person around him.
[02:26:28.778 --> 02:26:31.759]  He goes around burrowing into different groups and then blowing them.
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:34.300]  And then he's always connected to attacks.
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:39.022]  In fact, he's one of the guys in the Senate report from 99 from 98 attacking the Serbs.
[02:26:39.803 --> 02:26:40.903]  It's just like Bin Laden.
[02:26:41.063 --> 02:26:42.784]  And then they say, well, we don't want Bin Laden.
[02:26:43.904 --> 02:26:44.905]  The headline should be,
[02:26:46.313 --> 02:26:56.116]  MI6 crisis creator or MI6 agent of chaos being protected, carrying out attacks to get more funding for MI6.
[02:26:56.316 --> 02:27:00.377]  We have David Shaler on video, just coming out with it.
[02:27:00.397 --> 02:27:04.979]  David Shaler, MI5, has never gone public as much as he did in these video interviews he gave us.
[02:27:05.319 --> 02:27:09.420]  We're putting up on the web for members in the next few days and also some clips for everybody.
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:11.100]  It's so important.
[02:27:11.961 --> 02:27:13.301]  And also, folks,
[02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:16.651]  You should have heard the private discussions I had with Michael Major.
[02:27:18.832 --> 02:27:19.973]  But he was doing it off record.
[02:27:19.993 --> 02:27:21.494]  I don't want to say too much of what he said.
[02:27:23.275 --> 02:27:25.196]  It's just, everybody knows.
[02:27:25.336 --> 02:27:28.879]  I mean, it's... I'm gonna get Paul Watson's comment on this when we get back.
[02:27:29.819 --> 02:27:30.680]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:31.761]  Who has the motive?
[02:27:31.921 --> 02:27:33.402]  Whose approval ratings go up?
[02:27:33.942 --> 02:27:35.503]  Tony Blair's are skyrocketing!
[02:27:36.304 --> 02:27:37.184]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.684 --> 02:27:39.305]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:28:46.405 --> 02:28:48.006]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.146 --> 02:28:52.248]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.388 --> 02:28:55.270]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.350 --> 02:29:02.073]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.253 --> 02:29:05.255]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.455 --> 02:29:07.856]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.976 --> 02:29:12.719]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.879 --> 02:29:27.467]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.628 --> 02:29:34.311]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Blank Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-9000.
[02:29:37.894 --> 02:29:55.146]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:29:55.386 --> 02:29:57.748]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:29:58.008 --> 02:29:59.970]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:30:00.310 --> 02:30:05.674]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:30:06.094 --> 02:30:06.414]  I think so.
[02:30:26.447 --> 02:30:29.608]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[02:30:49.255 --> 02:30:49.755]  Don't worry.
[02:30:50.215 --> 02:30:51.776]  This show is documented.
[02:30:52.256 --> 02:30:55.536]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.556 --> 02:31:13.520]  I cannot stress how important it is that you get the articles that are posted on InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com detailing how this creature
[02:31:14.562 --> 02:31:26.767]  How this individual, who we were talking about him last Monday, a caller called in with an article from 1999 out of the Seattle Times, we posted it last Monday!
[02:31:27.327 --> 02:31:28.688]  Go and look at this guy!
[02:31:28.948 --> 02:31:33.950]  Building terror camps, the FBI wants to arrest him and they're told, no you can't!
[02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:37.932]  I'm not saying all the FBI agents are running around being terrorists!
[02:31:38.573 --> 02:31:40.134]  I'm not saying all the CIA is!
[02:31:40.174 --> 02:31:40.875]  That's the point!
[02:31:41.015 --> 02:31:44.938]  It's very small criminal groups, but they're at the top!
[02:31:45.718 --> 02:31:48.480]  And they've got these... Look, you've got different types of terror attacks.
[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:52.423]  You've got terror attacks where the government carries it out, because there's no Muslims involved.
[02:31:53.584 --> 02:32:00.229]  Then you've got the type where the government carries it out, but has decoys, people that thought they were part of drills, 9-11, 7-7,
[02:32:03.365 --> 02:32:17.335]  And then you've got these purely provocateur things where criminal groups actually hire criminals, and you know, the $100,000 is going in your account, all you've got to do is go throw this satchel bomb in here, and they do it, and they go bust them, and then, and then look at the response of government.
[02:32:17.576 --> 02:32:19.997]  Oh, it's all over, we're all dead, give your rights up!
[02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:24.581]  You know, I mean, when there's real terror attacks, folks, it isn't reported on.
[02:32:26.682 --> 02:32:32.567]  There are real terror, there are, there are real people who get together and go carry out terror attacks.
[02:32:33.636 --> 02:32:37.797]  And, uh, you know, they go on every day in Iraq, and you never hear about them.
[02:32:38.658 --> 02:32:40.218]  And they go on all over the world.
[02:32:40.238 --> 02:32:56.263]  I mean, there were, Bill Clinton pardoned thirty, what was it, thirty-two people, uh, who had carried out over a hundred and fifty bombings, uh, from the 1960s into the early 1980s, and they were given life in prison, no parole, and Bill Clinton pardoned them?
[02:32:57.184 --> 02:32:58.204]  Famous bombers?
[02:33:00.698 --> 02:33:06.140]  Back in the 60's they didn't give that much attention to it, because if it's real terrorism, you try to play it down.
[02:33:08.021 --> 02:33:11.482]  You don't, it's all over, we have to give up our whole way of life, oh the terrorists!
[02:33:11.962 --> 02:33:16.243]  Terrorists do that to get control, but if the government's the terrorist, they hype it up.
[02:33:18.144 --> 02:33:21.545]  Paul, I mean, listening to that clip again, again, it's up there with video on
[02:33:22.947 --> 02:33:31.669]  On PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now, I mean, we already knew all of this, but just to have it out in the open, why do you think Fox is admitting it?
[02:33:31.689 --> 02:33:35.870]  I mean, they obviously put it into high-level spin, but I don't think it works.
[02:33:36.990 --> 02:33:44.692]  Well, yeah, it's kind of steam valve spin to get it out there, but to gently release it and not have the full impact of it felt.
[02:33:44.752 --> 02:33:51.094]  The whole line of Al-Qaeda is infiltrating the intelligence agencies with these double agents.
[02:33:51.872 --> 02:33:54.554]  Well, it's not only the opposite way around.
[02:33:54.594 --> 02:34:04.200]  The intelligence agencies create the Al-Qaeda groups, and then all the copycat bombings are from idiots who buy into the phony ideology of it all.
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:05.301]  It's not even that, Paul.
[02:34:05.341 --> 02:34:16.849]  I mean, we have clear evidence that the agents, agents like this character, they then have useful idiots directly under their orders.
[02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:20.951]  Well, yeah, like Ayman Faris, who
[02:34:22.245 --> 02:34:24.747]  Supposedly plotted to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge.
[02:34:25.567 --> 02:34:27.769]  He turned out to be an FBI informant.
[02:34:28.969 --> 02:34:40.097]  Abu Qatada, under the protection of MI5, MI6, the so-called leader of the European wing of Al-Qaeda, under intelligence agency protection.
[02:34:40.957 --> 02:34:42.238]  Yeah, they've had fake arrests.
[02:34:42.258 --> 02:34:43.179]  You've got to repost this.
[02:34:43.199 --> 02:34:47.962]  They've had fake arrests where they actually go
[02:34:48.903 --> 02:34:56.729]  And arrest an Al-Qaeda leader and then a month later it's a tiny mention in the paper, oh he was really CIA, they staged the arrest to give him protection.
[02:34:57.990 --> 02:35:12.241]  Yeah, um, the FBI informant living with the hijackers, uh, in Detroit I think it was, Sheikh Khalid Mohammed, given his visa by the State Department six months before he's accused of being 9-11 mastermind.
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:17.902]  So in every case, it's not an accident that these people, you know, infiltrate the CIA.
[02:35:17.982 --> 02:35:18.382]  And see?
[02:35:18.603 --> 02:35:27.807]  We then talked to the embassy people who did it, on air, the head of the embassy, and they're told, we were told to let them in, it was part of a secret CIA anti-terror training.
[02:35:29.269 --> 02:35:30.950]  Yeah, Michael Springman.
[02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:32.910]  Paul, we've got to put all this together in one article.
[02:35:32.970 --> 02:35:33.830]  I'll have to do it if you can.
[02:35:33.850 --> 02:35:34.391]  I know you're sick.
[02:35:34.771 --> 02:35:39.952]  Or if Steve can, I'm getting ready for Coast to Coast tonight and trying to get this video uploaded and all these photos uploaded.
[02:35:39.992 --> 02:35:40.712]  I can't do it all.
[02:35:41.313 --> 02:35:43.553]  I want to put something up for everybody tonight, the morning parliament.
[02:35:43.573 --> 02:35:48.515]  I want to put up for members the Shaler and part of the Shaler and the
[02:35:50.177 --> 02:35:50.837]  That's right.
[02:35:50.917 --> 02:35:58.480]  I mean, on top of all the other evidence we've already got, after not even a month after the bombings, it's already conclusive
[02:36:15.978 --> 02:36:21.059]  The Drills story with 9-11 came out a year after this one came out literally days after.
[02:36:21.079 --> 02:36:21.820]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:23.920]  Headline, case closed.
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.881]  Government carrying out terror attacks in London.
[02:36:28.581 --> 02:36:32.022]  You know, Drills' cover story was only the beginning.
[02:36:32.322 --> 02:36:37.644]  Now with this evidence and the evidence of the bomb under the bus and all of it, it's just conclusive.
[02:36:37.684 --> 02:36:38.764]  There's no debating it!
[02:36:40.985 --> 02:36:41.425]  Exactly.
[02:36:41.445 --> 02:36:42.765]  It needs to be stated clearly.
[02:36:42.845 --> 02:36:43.786]  I mean, I'm sick of this!
[02:36:43.846 --> 02:36:45.026]  It's hidden in plain view!
[02:36:45.948 --> 02:36:47.729]  I'm tired of them killing people!
[02:36:49.130 --> 02:36:54.493]  Dick Cheney's running around saying we're going to get nuked, and Chertoff's saying it, so we've got to nuke Iran first.
[02:36:54.553 --> 02:36:56.134]  I mean, this is crazy, Paul.
[02:36:56.594 --> 02:36:58.075]  Look, your kids are going to get drafted, folks.
[02:36:58.095 --> 02:36:59.455]  They're going to take your private property.
[02:36:59.616 --> 02:37:01.697]  This war on terror is about setting up a police state.
[02:37:01.877 --> 02:37:03.878]  It's going to be hell on earth if we don't stop this.
[02:37:05.129 --> 02:37:06.530]  Aren't you sick of these people, Paul?
[02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:15.634]  Aren't you sick of these inbred, degenerate scumbags running everything that just think of us as their slaves, that think nothing of our lives?
[02:37:15.694 --> 02:37:17.035]  We're sick of you, globalists!
[02:37:17.415 --> 02:37:18.596]  You pieces of pus!
[02:37:19.316 --> 02:37:20.897]  Well, exactly, and I mean...
[02:37:21.927 --> 02:37:24.669]  Both Congress and Parliament are just empty shells.
[02:37:24.689 --> 02:37:29.192]  We were talking to Meacher and he was saying that these kind of issues are always raised.
[02:37:29.212 --> 02:37:30.413]  They have a debate about it.
[02:37:30.593 --> 02:37:33.434]  The Speaker of the House says, right, 7 p.m.
[02:37:33.454 --> 02:37:34.935]  everybody goes home and that's it.
[02:37:34.955 --> 02:37:36.176]  Nothing's ever done about it.
[02:37:36.196 --> 02:37:38.037]  You know what I mean?
[02:37:38.077 --> 02:37:39.778]  Meacher's a naive guy.
[02:37:39.899 --> 02:37:41.880]  In a lot of cases, you knew more than him.
[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:49.645]  So that shows that... Well, he even said that, but then... I don't want to brag about that, Paul, but the point is, is that privately when he
[02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:52.255]  He insisted we drink beer with him.
[02:37:52.275 --> 02:37:53.516]  He was a really nice fella.
[02:37:54.717 --> 02:37:55.898]  Total English gentleman.
[02:37:56.859 --> 02:37:58.400]  Number three in the Blair cabinet, folks.
[02:37:58.861 --> 02:38:03.865]  We're sitting there at his home at 10 o'clock at night after two hours of interviews.
[02:38:04.045 --> 02:38:06.207]  The stuff he said about 9-11 off record.
[02:38:07.188 --> 02:38:08.569]  He didn't say this was off record.
[02:38:08.589 --> 02:38:09.970]  I just feel like it was.
[02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:14.634]  I guess we ought to just come out with the stuff.
[02:38:14.674 --> 02:38:15.635]  He said he'll come on the show.
[02:38:15.655 --> 02:38:17.896]  I'll just get him on the show this week or next week.
[02:38:19.395 --> 02:38:20.636]  And just let him say it on air.
[02:38:21.797 --> 02:38:35.547]  Well, I mean, the bottom line is when we say government's behind the attacks, it's that tiny cabal right at the top, because the vast majority of MPs are probably much like Michael Meacham, nice, polite people trying to, you know, do a service to their country.
[02:38:36.087 --> 02:38:47.115]  So that's why it's not some gigantic conspiracy like all these detractors and attack artists try to label it as, which it's not, and we never said it was, the small elite right at the top.
[02:38:49.221 --> 02:39:07.484]  Yeah, I mean, really all it is, is we're standing here, we see the Bengal Tiger in the woods, we see him moving, we heard him growl, we got here earlier than other people, we see his eyes, you can see him clear as day, and people walk up to us, we go, watch out, there's a, you know, there's a tiger, a Bengal Tiger right there, and they go, I don't see it.
[02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:18.026]  I go, look, it's right there, you know, and now the Bengal Tiger is out in the open with a spotlight on him, jumping around on a pogo stick, riding a unicycle.
[02:39:19.139 --> 02:39:20.521]  I mean, there's no way to miss him!
[02:39:23.545 --> 02:39:27.710]  But people will choose to, like the guy who chose to not believe the cameras existed.
[02:39:28.385 --> 02:39:32.366]  Folks, understand, I literally walk up to him and I go, he goes, what are you doing?
[02:39:32.546 --> 02:39:33.546]  I never noticed those cameras.
[02:39:33.566 --> 02:39:36.307]  Because, you know, there's an outdoor eating area at the Hard Rock Cafe.
[02:39:36.607 --> 02:39:39.827]  We're right there in the most elite part of London, across the street from Buckingham Palace.
[02:39:40.367 --> 02:39:41.708]  And there's just cameras everywhere.
[02:39:41.728 --> 02:39:43.208]  I mean, they're like five feet off the ground.
[02:39:43.308 --> 02:39:44.308]  Gigantic cameras.
[02:39:44.868 --> 02:39:45.968]  He goes, I've never seen that.
[02:39:46.028 --> 02:39:47.069]  The staff are all going, look.
[02:39:47.629 --> 02:39:48.969]  Oh, look at them.
[02:39:48.989 --> 02:39:50.509]  And those have been there for years, folks.
[02:39:51.809 --> 02:39:54.250]  They didn't see it because they've never been conscious.
[02:39:55.563 --> 02:39:57.586]  Paul, what must people walk around and think?
[02:39:57.646 --> 02:40:01.430]  Are they thinking about how to look cool or how to party or what shirt they want to buy?
[02:40:01.450 --> 02:40:02.812]  I mean, what's in their brains?
[02:40:04.254 --> 02:40:06.436]  It's cognitive dissonance.
[02:40:06.596 --> 02:40:11.823]  Deep down in their souls, if they don't want to think about it because they know it's bad, then they'll block it out.
[02:40:11.943 --> 02:40:12.704]  They'll create that
[02:40:13.913 --> 02:40:19.197]  Well, I think wealth brings us on.
[02:40:19.217 --> 02:40:21.339]  You talk to third world people who have been under slavery.
[02:40:21.379 --> 02:40:22.380]  Man, they understand.
[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:22.980]  They know.
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:24.561]  You know, they get it.
[02:40:24.601 --> 02:40:25.862]  They know how the frauds work.
[02:40:26.943 --> 02:40:35.469]  But you talk to people who have been in a lap of luxury, doing well, they're pretty nice, they're, you know, goofy, and they're just nice and so they judge the world like they are.
[02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:37.391]  They're like children, Paul.
[02:40:38.157 --> 02:40:39.358]  They're like five-year-olds.
[02:40:39.398 --> 02:40:40.578]  They're just so naive.
[02:40:40.618 --> 02:40:41.179]  It's painful.
[02:40:41.479 --> 02:40:45.121]  And sometimes I feel like I'm a meanie, you know, ruining their illusion.
[02:40:45.481 --> 02:40:47.802]  But my family's future is in the balance.
[02:40:47.842 --> 02:40:48.323]  Yours is.
[02:40:48.643 --> 02:40:50.904]  And folks, this stuff doesn't go away just because you deny it.
[02:40:51.544 --> 02:40:52.345]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:40:52.445 --> 02:40:56.267]  I wish this... Paul, don't you wish it really was a few ragtag Muslim terrorists?
[02:40:56.287 --> 02:40:58.688]  I mean, it is scarier to know it's our governments.
[02:41:00.409 --> 02:41:00.909]  Well, it is.
[02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:05.472]  I mean, there's still a better chance of being struck by lightning than dying in a terrorist attack, but...
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:15.013]  I mean, if it was real terrorists, as you said, the best thing to do if you were a government and you wanted to keep stability would be to play it down and say it was all under control.
[02:41:15.434 --> 02:41:21.743]  When they're doing the direct opposite and you've got blazing headlines in the papers every day, third terrorist they're on the loose.
[02:41:22.327 --> 02:41:27.772]  Then you know who stands to gain and who's putting out that spin to capitalize on the terror attacks.
[02:41:27.832 --> 02:41:28.533]  It's the government.
[02:41:28.773 --> 02:41:31.396]  Meanwhile, the approval ratings for Blair have exploded.
[02:41:31.436 --> 02:41:36.741]  Bush's went up for a few weeks but have already plunged back downward in most polling data, you know, and other questions.
[02:41:37.081 --> 02:41:38.243]  How's he handling the economy?
[02:41:38.323 --> 02:41:38.903]  Is he honest?
[02:41:38.923 --> 02:41:39.484]  Do you trust him?
[02:41:39.764 --> 02:41:42.044]  But on the war, it's up a little again.
[02:41:42.545 --> 02:41:44.725]  Again, who gets the weapons contracts?
[02:41:44.745 --> 02:41:45.585]  Who gets the control?
[02:41:45.945 --> 02:41:49.866]  And the globalists may flush Blair and Bush down the toilet next week, folks, politically.
[02:41:50.306 --> 02:41:54.427]  The point is, the globalists above them will just put a new birdcage liner in there.
[02:41:55.527 --> 02:41:57.527]  Well, yeah, they're just batteries in the machine.
[02:41:57.567 --> 02:42:01.448]  They'll just change the batteries when there's no power left in them.
[02:42:01.568 --> 02:42:02.008]  Exactly!
[02:42:02.028 --> 02:42:05.469]  We're all busy focused on Karl Rove and the Democrats and the Republicans.
[02:42:05.849 --> 02:42:07.109]  These are just puppets, people!
[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:19.129]  You know, every day they come out and admit that they're torturing children, they're killing people, and they're doing all this horrible stuff, Paul, and then... It just makes my head spin.
[02:42:23.033 --> 02:42:24.054]  Where do you think it's all going?
[02:42:26.136 --> 02:42:31.802]  Well, if this American conservative quote is anything to judge by, it's going into Iran pretty quick.
[02:42:32.819 --> 02:42:33.279]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[02:42:33.299 --> 02:42:40.125]  intelligence... The FBI admits that it would be a pretext, even if Iran... there's no evidence that Iran is behind the next U.S.
[02:42:40.185 --> 02:42:40.946]  terror attack.
[02:42:41.506 --> 02:42:44.388]  The order is direct to go in there as soon as it happens.
[02:42:44.649 --> 02:42:45.389]  Yes, it's admitted.
[02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:51.354]  Cheney, it is confirmed, has said, we're going to nuke them and attack them the minute... the minute we're attacked again.
[02:42:51.474 --> 02:42:52.755]  And they want to attack Iran.
[02:42:53.055 --> 02:42:54.937]  Gee, I wonder who has a motive to attack?
[02:42:55.717 --> 02:42:57.519]  Now, right here, this is the New York Times.
[02:42:58.710 --> 02:43:02.872]  This is the Washington Post.
[02:43:03.372 --> 02:43:05.933]  Iran is judged ten years from nuclear bomb, U.S.
[02:43:05.973 --> 02:43:09.054]  intelligence review, contrast with administration statements.
[02:43:09.654 --> 02:43:10.275]  A major U.S.
[02:43:10.295 --> 02:43:23.780]  intelligence review has projected that Iran is about a decade away from manufacturing the key ingredient, just the ingredients for a nuclear weapon, roughly doubling the previous estimate of five years according to government sources with first-hand knowledge of the new analysis.
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:25.681]  Now look, either way folks,
[02:43:27.142 --> 02:43:31.164]  The IAEA at one time has over 1,000 U.N.
[02:43:32.024 --> 02:43:36.867]  inspectors and employees checking every factory, every facility.
[02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:43.110]  The IAEA admits they have been given total authorization to go anywhere.
[02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:46.511]  So that sets the precedent to have the U.N.
[02:43:46.571 --> 02:43:48.973]  here, there, everywhere, doing whatever they want.
[02:43:49.233 --> 02:43:51.614]  So you accept total enslavement to that,
[02:43:52.569 --> 02:43:55.110]  Meanwhile, you're still being threatened by the bad cop equation.
[02:43:55.130 --> 02:43:56.271]  This is all good cop, bad cop.
[02:43:56.791 --> 02:44:00.412]  We're going to nuke you if anybody attacks us again.
[02:44:00.432 --> 02:44:03.854]  I mean, it's so transparent.
[02:44:04.154 --> 02:44:06.014]  So either way, Iran accepts the U.N.
[02:44:06.135 --> 02:44:11.797]  option, which is bad enough as a sovereign country, or they have the globalists come in with the bad cop and get them.
[02:44:13.497 --> 02:44:14.618]  I mean, Paul, they admit
[02:44:15.376 --> 02:44:16.898]  Iran has done nothing, Paul!
[02:44:17.138 --> 02:44:19.921]  And then Iran comes out and says, MI6 is behind the attacks.
[02:44:20.201 --> 02:44:20.721]  You're behind 9-11.
[02:44:21.242 --> 02:44:22.023]  We're not doing it.
[02:44:22.283 --> 02:44:23.484]  You're behind Hezbollah.
[02:44:24.525 --> 02:44:25.967]  You're behind Islamic Jihad.
[02:44:26.888 --> 02:44:32.493]  You know, we were fools 20 years ago to believe that they were legitimate and we did go along, but now we know it's you!
[02:44:32.573 --> 02:44:33.294]  It's all you!
[02:44:33.354 --> 02:44:34.795]  We don't want to attack you, America!
[02:44:35.216 --> 02:44:36.938]  This is going to mean the end!
[02:44:36.958 --> 02:44:39.160]  I mean, their own government's saying it, Paul!
[02:44:40.777 --> 02:44:48.543]  Well, yeah, you often find that the countries who express the most fealty are the ones who are targeted first.
[02:44:48.583 --> 02:45:00.912]  The case of Iraq, obviously, with North Korea, when, you know, this psychotic dictator has actually got nukes, which were given to him by Donald Rumsfeld, partly.
[02:45:01.784 --> 02:45:07.309]  Um, there's no, even though, you know, the dummy missile hit Alaska, there's no talk of going into North Korea.
[02:45:07.689 --> 02:45:16.516]  I mean, eventually they probably will, but, you know, we were told the real threats were drones from Iraq, which could reach Britain and the U.S.
[02:45:17.156 --> 02:45:21.099]  in 45 minutes, when, you know, they couldn't even attack the neighboring country in 45 minutes.
[02:45:22.805 --> 02:45:29.986]  Down on British TV, they actually played film of V2s and V6s from 1945-44 hitting the country.
[02:45:30.346 --> 02:45:31.107]  The fear monger.
[02:45:31.127 --> 02:45:32.327]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[02:45:36.028 --> 02:45:41.028]  And then, meanwhile, folks, we have this headline out of the Associated Press.
[02:45:41.509 --> 02:45:44.789]  Over 500 arrests of gang members under Homeland Security.
[02:45:45.049 --> 02:45:48.890]  I thought they were for fighting terror, but they say, oh no, crime is terror, Paul.
[02:45:50.547 --> 02:45:55.631]  Well yeah, that's what it's merging into, because then they can identify everyone as a terrorist.
[02:45:55.751 --> 02:46:07.859]  And obviously, the enemy combatant designation means that by order of George Bush, anybody, anywhere in the world, whether they're foreign or an American citizen, can be killed on the spot.
[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:16.325]  By the way, Ireland last Wednesday signed a deal for extradition under and agreed to follow the Patriot Act guidelines.
[02:46:16.406 --> 02:46:18.167]  Folks, that's the Irish times.
[02:46:20.413 --> 02:46:21.134]  Let's take a call.
[02:46:21.214 --> 02:46:22.155]  Nolan in Texas.
[02:46:22.655 --> 02:46:23.536]  Nolan, you're on the air.
[02:46:23.556 --> 02:46:24.256]  Go ahead, Nolan.
[02:46:24.477 --> 02:46:24.817]  Thank you.
[02:46:25.377 --> 02:46:29.741]  I was listening and it's odd that we're kind of on the same wavelength today.
[02:46:29.801 --> 02:46:31.162]  Why are we so blind?
[02:46:31.223 --> 02:46:33.224]  Why can we not see what they're doing?
[02:46:33.745 --> 02:46:36.027]  You know, how come we're so gutless and spineless?
[02:46:36.067 --> 02:46:38.189]  Where did American's heart and soul go?
[02:46:38.829 --> 02:46:39.670]  Look at the fluoride.
[02:46:41.621 --> 02:46:43.181]  Look at what they've fed us for years.
[02:46:43.201 --> 02:46:43.461]  No, no.
[02:46:43.501 --> 02:46:44.782]  Sodium chloride's deadly.
[02:46:45.202 --> 02:46:46.042]  Aspartame's deadly.
[02:46:46.062 --> 02:46:47.362]  It all affects brain function.
[02:46:47.402 --> 02:46:48.082]  Major studies.
[02:46:48.342 --> 02:46:48.623]  Right.
[02:46:48.803 --> 02:46:51.463]  And those of us... But it's like the guy saying, what camera?
[02:46:51.923 --> 02:46:53.223]  He goes, well, I never saw those before.
[02:46:53.243 --> 02:46:55.404]  And he actually said, I choose to not see them.
[02:46:55.884 --> 02:46:58.024]  It's some kind of mind control or something.
[02:46:59.625 --> 02:47:01.465]  What about the moral coward?
[02:47:01.905 --> 02:47:09.627]  The people who are afraid to see what the government's doing because if they admit it to themselves that they know what they're doing, and then they choose to do nothing,
[02:47:10.322 --> 02:47:12.483]  They've either admitted that they're not... Well that's it.
[02:47:12.503 --> 02:47:16.384]  A yuppie, I've seen yuppies with the words, but everybody does it, decides that it's not a threat.
[02:47:16.764 --> 02:47:19.305]  They'll deny it exists until you prove it, and they'll go, OK, I'm for it.
[02:47:19.985 --> 02:47:23.246]  In the same... Oh, we saw that over and over again in England, didn't we?
[02:47:24.606 --> 02:47:25.167]  Exactly.
[02:47:25.567 --> 02:47:32.829]  And people have this belief that if they look into any of this and make it part of their lives, then somehow it will make them depressed.
[02:47:33.669 --> 02:47:41.855]  I mean, I'm the most energized I've ever been in my life for knowing all this, because the enemy's right in front of you and you know exactly what steps to take.
[02:47:42.175 --> 02:47:43.636]  I have almost unlimited energy.
[02:47:43.956 --> 02:47:45.578]  I almost kill myself doing it.
[02:47:45.618 --> 02:47:46.338]  I gotta stop.
[02:47:46.398 --> 02:47:49.060]  I mean, I don't know what they're talking about.
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:57.926]  I mean, when you know a bunch of leering, evil, child-molesting murderers run things, I mean, and you know they're taking over, you've got unlimited energy to fight them!
[02:47:58.727 --> 02:48:02.770]  I hear you say that, and I still can't wrap my mind around what you're saying.
[02:48:03.271 --> 02:48:09.976]  Even though I'm starting to... They kill children, they rape them, they are... The people running things are pure evil, sir.
[02:48:10.496 --> 02:48:17.541]  I just can't... I don't like them, you know, I see it, but I just can't quite get my head wrapped around their daddy.
[02:48:18.061 --> 02:48:19.022]  That's pretty sick.
[02:48:19.682 --> 02:48:22.464]  They actually challenge each other to be more evil, sir.
[02:48:23.505 --> 02:48:24.185]  You understand that?
[02:48:24.425 --> 02:48:25.346]  They see it as shrink.
[02:48:26.064 --> 02:48:28.985]  Well, my reality is very different from theirs.
[02:48:29.106 --> 02:48:33.548]  And I can't grasp their... See, you just said, why can't people admit stuff to themselves?
[02:48:33.608 --> 02:48:36.449]  It's because you're judging the world according to your compass.
[02:48:36.789 --> 02:48:38.570]  Stay there, I'll let you finish up real quick when we get back.
[02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:42.652]  Final words from Paul, a few other tidbits of news, personblinded.tv, check it out.
[02:48:47.074 --> 02:48:49.936]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.669 --> 02:48:51.951]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:52.171 --> 02:48:57.919]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:58.179 --> 02:49:03.446]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.727 --> 02:49:05.349]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[02:49:05.469 --> 02:49:07.891]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:08.051 --> 02:49:11.835]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:16.720]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.820 --> 02:49:23.066]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:23.126 --> 02:49:24.948]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:49:25.428 --> 02:49:27.510]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[02:49:27.591 --> 02:49:31.875]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:31.935 --> 02:49:33.997]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:34.738 --> 02:49:39.122]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:49:39.243 --> 02:49:41.225]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:49:41.465 --> 02:49:42.986]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:43.167 --> 02:49:45.269]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:46.585 --> 02:49:51.810]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.950 --> 02:50:00.037]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.297 --> 02:50:07.343]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.523 --> 02:50:08.803]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:08.883 --> 02:50:14.785]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.965 --> 02:50:20.047]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:20.167 --> 02:50:28.990]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.

[02:50:47.785 --> 02:50:53.753]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.973 --> 02:50:56.236]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:56.416 --> 02:51:02.784]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:03.164 --> 02:51:03.764]  I think so.
[02:51:23.430 --> 02:51:23.830]  I think so.
[02:51:57.785 --> 02:51:59.728]  Calling for new and global internet control.
[02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:01.351]  Washington D.C.
[02:52:01.371 --> 02:52:11.549]  Senator Norm Coleman today submitted a statement into the congressional record denouncing a final report issued by the United Nations calling for a tax on the internet.
[02:52:12.270 --> 02:52:13.791]  I've been talking about that for five years.
[02:52:13.851 --> 02:52:16.153]  I'm a conspiracy theorist when I talk about it, when the U.N.
[02:52:16.193 --> 02:52:17.013]  openly calls for it.
[02:52:17.493 --> 02:52:27.100]  By the way, they automatically tag a pound a day or two bucks a day onto your hotel bill and run weird United Nations announcements about how it's for the children to vaccinate them.
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:30.142]  Yeah, with a special sterilization and AIDS injections.
[02:52:30.522 --> 02:52:31.743]  And by the way, they've been caught doing it.
[02:52:31.763 --> 02:52:33.384]  The Nobel Prize winner has gone public on it.
[02:52:34.125 --> 02:52:35.026]  And that's how it works.
[02:52:35.066 --> 02:52:36.066]  The tax is already there.
[02:52:36.086 --> 02:52:37.167]  They're just pushing on you.
[02:52:37.627 --> 02:52:38.827]  Paul, quick comment on that.
[02:52:38.847 --> 02:52:42.709]  We're going to let Nolan finish up and talk to Chris in Colorado.
[02:52:44.050 --> 02:52:48.032]  Well, yeah, the Internet is a new frontier of alternative media.
[02:52:48.232 --> 02:53:00.999]  And when you've got stories like one blog created every second, you know, a good percentage of which are political blogs, then they're in trouble because that's taking over the Internet.
[02:53:02.026 --> 02:53:08.928]  They've got every reason to try and shut it down, and that's what we're trying to do with things like that, and also the tax on sending emails.
[02:53:09.288 --> 02:53:14.029]  Well, here it is, London schoolboy grabbed by the British, taken to another country to have his genitals cut.
[02:53:14.650 --> 02:53:15.630]  That's the London Guardian.
[02:53:15.670 --> 02:53:17.390]  I mean, this is the type of stuff we've got here.
[02:53:17.410 --> 02:53:21.051]  They're gonna have a show trial with Saddam, their former business partner on TV.
[02:53:21.552 --> 02:53:29.694]  Again, I don't like Saddam, but that'd be like if a mafia don burned one of his capos for no reason, and sat as the judge over him, saying he was a criminal.
[02:53:30.234 --> 02:53:33.778]  I mean, it's just, you know, it's ridiculous!
[02:53:34.198 --> 02:53:35.659]  Nolan, finish up real fast.
[02:53:35.799 --> 02:53:36.640]  I've got a question.
[02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:42.405]  I want to know what is the penalty prescribed in the United States Code for failure to uphold the oath of office?
[02:53:42.766 --> 02:53:44.988]  And our forefathers did not put so much
[02:53:45.709 --> 02:53:49.351]  emphasis on that oath of office for there to be no penalty for failure to uphold it.
[02:53:49.391 --> 02:53:58.936]  Well, it's just you're kicked out of office if you haven't done the oath or if you don't uphold it, you get impeached and it's either the legislature or the Congress that moves to do that.
[02:53:58.956 --> 02:53:59.717]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:00.557 --> 02:54:01.598]  Let's take one quick call.
[02:54:01.658 --> 02:54:03.459]  Chris in Colorado, you're our last caller.
[02:54:03.479 --> 02:54:03.939]  Go ahead.
[02:54:03.959 --> 02:54:06.000]  Hi Alex, this is Chris.
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:07.001]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:54:07.041 --> 02:54:07.321]  Welcome.
[02:54:08.121 --> 02:54:08.522]  Thank you.
[02:54:09.122 --> 02:54:12.764]  What you've been talking about, the reason people don't see this, this is psychopolitics.
[02:54:14.016 --> 02:54:15.198]  And it is mind control.
[02:54:15.539 --> 02:54:16.701]  It discredits people.
[02:54:17.022 --> 02:54:17.863]  It's barbaric.
[02:54:17.903 --> 02:54:19.205]  It invokes obedience.
[02:54:20.327 --> 02:54:25.056]  And it discredits the government, which is what they're trying to do to take everything down economically.
[02:54:27.259 --> 02:54:32.281]  Well, it's just a lot of cowardly people wanting to deny how bad things have gotten because they're so self-centered.
[02:54:32.761 --> 02:54:37.322]  The funny thing is, if they were really self-centered, they would care about everybody else and fight this.
[02:54:37.382 --> 02:54:42.104]  I mean, folks, if you really know what's going on, you'd fight this because this is going to ruin your day.
[02:54:42.844 --> 02:54:46.025]  The trick they've been sold is only caring about themselves makes them safe.
[02:54:46.045 --> 02:54:46.565]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:54:47.245 --> 02:54:47.625]  I'm sorry.
[02:54:47.705 --> 02:54:50.066]  It's hypnotic.
[02:54:50.406 --> 02:54:51.646]  Hypnosis.
[02:54:51.907 --> 02:54:53.207]  It's mind control.
[02:54:55.036 --> 02:54:56.917]  Well, I think a lot of it is chemical, too.
[02:54:56.957 --> 02:55:06.203]  I mean, the studies from the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, a lot of it is today, shows that sodium and stannous fluoride is a toxic sedative.
[02:55:06.923 --> 02:55:11.426]  But also being ignored and taking away people's land, the farmers.
[02:55:11.927 --> 02:55:12.607]  They're independent.
[02:55:12.627 --> 02:55:13.388]  That's what they did in America.
[02:55:13.408 --> 02:55:13.848]  No, you're right.
[02:55:13.868 --> 02:55:15.089]  They're getting rid of all independents.
[02:55:15.109 --> 02:55:15.949]  We're out of time, Chris.
[02:55:15.969 --> 02:55:17.090]  I want to thank you for calling in.
[02:55:17.531 --> 02:55:20.352]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 central, back to 9, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:20.412 --> 02:55:21.453]  Paul, closing comments.
[02:55:22.654 --> 02:55:24.135]  Well, I was just thinking about
[02:55:25.351 --> 02:55:28.353]  What the big stories are going to be for the next few weeks.
[02:55:28.433 --> 02:55:47.323]  I'm still waiting on those so-called new horrific Abu Ghraib videos and photos which were supposed to be released this week or last week, I think, but have been completely obliterated by the whole Karl Rove thing, which is starting to look like a distraction from all these other important issues.
[02:55:47.403 --> 02:55:50.065]  And the space shuttle thing definitely is.
[02:55:50.445 --> 02:55:50.585]  Yeah.
[02:55:51.477 --> 02:55:53.338]  And the way they hyped up the problems to begin with.
[02:55:53.638 --> 02:55:54.458]  Good job, Paul.
[02:55:54.478 --> 02:55:57.739]  A lot of big updates coming on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:55:58.079 --> 02:56:02.100]  And video coming tonight, tomorrow, and the next day as we unroll this information.

[02:56:03.921 --> 02:56:04.221]  You bet.
