[00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:06.579]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.280]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.121]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:11.581]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.862]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:17.864]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:22.205]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:29.628]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:30.889]  It is September 5th, 2005.
[00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.409]  On this Monday...
[00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:36.638]  Labor Day edition.
[00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:44.201]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we're going straight to your calls in the next segment.
[00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:50.824]  Almost talk show hosts are basking in the Maui sun today, off relaxing or...
[00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:53.802]  Grilling hamburgers and T-bones.
[00:00:53.922 --> 00:01:08.566]  We are here, ladies and gentlemen, going out live, covering the tragic aftermath of Katrina, now sending shockwaves, not just through our economy, but the world economy as gas prices rise steadily upwards.
[00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:12.107]  The feds now have to admit what we could tell day one.
[00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:18.889]  Thousands of dead, and still perhaps thousands more dead, because of federal inaction.
[00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:27.591]  There are now more and more publications coming out and saying that there was evidence that someone might have blown up the levee.
[00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:33.355]  I see really nothing conclusive on that, but that is floating around out there.
[00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:44.725]  But what we do know, this is conclusive, the federal government specifically cut, you read one article it says by 40%, another article by 90%.
[00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.887]  On average, it was in the
[00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:50.099]  High 80s.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:10.901]  I've got nine different articles here out of the Times, Picayune, the big newspaper there in New Orleans, and reporting just the last year and a half where they were slashing the funding, in many cases over 90%, specifically to send the money to Iraq.
[00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:25.257]  So to pay for the sewage treatment plants and water treatment plants and power plants that the global has bombed to repair their systems, we don't get to have our levies fixed here.
[00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:31.820]  Also, the governor has actually refused to give total control over the National Guard, over to Lord Bush.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.302]  Lord Bush has announced that he's suspending posse commentatus over the weekend.
[00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:38.163]  He's had several
[00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:42.704]  He's been caught red-handed in these photo ops.
[00:02:42.784 --> 00:02:53.808]  Also, Condoleezza Rice late last week was booed out of a popular play called Spin in New York because everybody knew about the scope of the disaster.
[00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:59.850]  And there she was up in the box, clapping and smiling and smirking like the demon she is.
[00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.771]  And she was actually booed.
[00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:08.593]  So, see, she didn't care of the world and the public knew she was on vacation and wasn't planning to cancel any of it for the victims.
[00:03:09.654 --> 00:03:13.816]  You know, we just cancel our vacation here to come in and do a talk show on a holiday.
[00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:14.456]  Why?
[00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:15.717]  Because it's our job.
[00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:22.281]  I mean, if I would have been on vacation last week, I would have canceled my vacation immediately.
[00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:27.084]  Thank God I came the week before, but, you know, to come in and do a talk show.
[00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.266]  Again, I have no authority, folks.
[00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:31.427]  I'm not the government.
[00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.206]  But that's just how it works.
[00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:42.590]  I mean, I saw Sean Hannity and Alan Combs on when Rehnquist died Saturday night, you know, at 1 a.m.
[00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.170]  in the morning.
[00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.051]  Because that's their job.
[00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:46.252]  Big events happen.
[00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:48.153]  They come in and they report.
[00:03:48.873 --> 00:03:49.974]  Just like that's what we do.
[00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:54.636]  But no, the government that's actually supposedly running things.
[00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:59.018]  I mean, folks, George Washington would go four days without sleep.
[00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:00.414]  Okay?
[00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:09.877]  Even once he was elected president, he would go days without sleep when there was something to deal with because he had responsibility.
[00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:13.399]  I couldn't stand Bill Clinton.
[00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:18.180]  I mean, just a horrible, criminal, un-American, gun-grabbing piece of trash.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.062]  But Bill Clinton, working to destroy America, did work 16 to 17 hours a day.
[00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.143]  George Bush takes two naps.
[00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:28.804]  Folks, how do you take two naps?
[00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:29.889]  It's admitted.
[00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:37.071]  Two naps a day, exercises twice a day, he takes out several hours to read novels.
[00:04:38.151 --> 00:04:41.332]  I mean, he has the life of a dilettante.
[00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:44.313]  A total... And again, Bush is a puppet.
[00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:51.395]  We'll talk about the aftermath, the latest info on the ravaged Gulf region, and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:52.055]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:52.815]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:05.694]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:06.635]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:07.516]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.856 --> 00:05:12.541]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:17.305]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.726 --> 00:05:21.890]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.951]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:29.692]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:34.313]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:41.775]  Plung the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:44.456]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:46.336]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.536 --> 00:05:49.838]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:49.858 --> 00:05:54.481]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.261]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:09.483]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:09.743 --> 00:06:12.525]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.106]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:23.949]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.490]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.872]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:30.172 --> 00:06:30.372]  I think.
[00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:51.925]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:52.826]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:05.336]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:07:05.436 --> 00:07:10.499]  We all eat sugars, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:16.901]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:22.824]  That's why a Garricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:07:23.084 --> 00:07:28.586]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:07:28.826 --> 00:07:32.667]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:37.969]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:38.349]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:39.329]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:45.612]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:06.671]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:08.392]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.173]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:11.653]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.413 --> 00:08:13.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.974 --> 00:08:17.635]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:22.277]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.477 --> 00:08:27.579]  All right, my friends, it is Monday, the fifth day of September, 2005.
[00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:53.350]  Well over a week since this disaster, the disaster, the string of disasters, the constellation of calamities began to unfold and take place in the Gulf Coast region from Louisiana to the panhandle of Florida up into Alabama.
[00:08:55.325 --> 00:09:03.089]  And I know that many of you have been listening to the radio, reading the newspaper, watching television, and so you know most of the general details.
[00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:22.860]  But I tell you, the dominant broadcast media, television, though they are admitting that Bush dropped the ball and though they are admitting that they screwed up really bad, still they are absconding with the truth and really deceiving the people about the full scope of the disaster
[00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:26.611]  And just how bad a job the government did do.
[00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:38.397]  They are now, of course, having to admit that at least several thousand people are dead, and they're saying that number could be many, many times that.
[00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:50.323]  So it could easily dwarf, it could easily overshadow the dead of 9-11, with that anniversary coming up in less than five days.
[00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:53.429]  That anniversary coming up in about four days.
[00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:11.101]  The four year anniversary of the tragic events at the World Trade Center complex in the Pentagon and out in Shanksville, Pennsylvania the 2,800 and something dead Americans at the hands of the New World Order.
[00:10:13.463 --> 00:10:20.448]  And you know, anytime there is a robbery of a high security installation or facility or company, the first
[00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.991]  Group that the police look at are the security guards.
[00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:36.033]  Because generally, most crimes, especially high-risk crimes, more often than not, the highest percentage of the time, it's an inside job.
[00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:40.974]  Most crimes of any complexity are inside jobs.
[00:10:41.494 --> 00:10:42.574]  Now that's the statistics.
[00:10:42.614 --> 00:10:50.556]  And so we looked at 9-11, and sure enough, all the evidence, the motives, just a million pieces of evidence, it's an orgy of evidence.
[00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:55.141]  To the point of, you've got to think somebody was trying to get caught.
[00:10:55.221 --> 00:11:07.047]  Clearly, criminal elements carried out the entire attack, and what you're told publicly is a theater, is a fiction, is a manufactured facsimile or counterfeit.
[00:11:07.147 --> 00:11:07.968]  It is not the truth.
[00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:13.234]  But I always have to be careful about things.
[00:11:13.274 --> 00:11:18.198]  I have to look at them and it takes time generally to really assess the situation.
[00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:27.366]  I'm not going to get on air and shoot my mouth off day one like so many crackpot patriots do and say that it's weather modification.
[00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:34.032]  I'm not going to get on the air day one and say that some group or some individual blew up that levee.
[00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:39.319]  I'm not going to get on air day one and say, this is the martial law takeover.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.381]  This is it.
[00:11:41.563 --> 00:11:43.546]  Grab your guns and head for the hills.
[00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:49.857]  But now, seven days into this, seven, eight days into this...
[00:11:52.165 --> 00:12:06.229]  I mean, more questions than answers, and normally we get more answers as time goes along, and we are getting lots of answers, and a picture is starting to emerge, but it's like an ever-expanding puzzle.
[00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:07.670]  We just keep getting more pieces.
[00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.390]  But I know this, bottom line.
[00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:18.653]  This is going to help the New World Order, the globalists, the social architects, the criminally insane...
[00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:32.824]  Kleptomaniac control freaks, the freedom-hating parasite rulers that we have, the tragic events of New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[00:12:33.906 --> 00:12:55.258]  Is only going to help social engineering put more controls into our lives, train us to accept troops on the streets, train us to accept checkpoints, train us to accept the images of people in sports stadiums and being searched and frisked and crowds beating each other to death and rapes and murders.
[00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:05.195]  And notice the whole backdrop has been martial law is coming, martial law is coming, terrorists are going to attack, give up all your rights, only the government can save you.
[00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:10.680]  There's going to be natural disasters, and we're going to take all your rights away when it happens.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:20.067]  So we have this whole preparation, the globalists setting the table, is a good way to put it, in preparation of all of this.
[00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:22.269]  And at first I thought,
[00:13:22.933 --> 00:13:25.855]  Maybe the government just is totally inept.
[00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:26.736]  We know they're inept.
[00:13:27.497 --> 00:13:35.542]  We know that in big, massive operations, they are lumbering to say the least.
[00:13:36.203 --> 00:13:42.328]  And at the other extreme of that area of the spectrum, they are just complete idiots.
[00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:46.831]  But there are elements of the government that are total precision.
[00:13:47.535 --> 00:14:00.163]  I mean, they can refuel in the air and fly for 3,000 miles and then drop a bomb down a chimney and then fly back and refuel and then go land on the deck of an aircraft carrier.
[00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:04.446]  So we know there's also a lot of precision.
[00:14:05.527 --> 00:14:13.572]  And the precision is in controlling and steering and manipulating the chaos.
[00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:16.034]  And
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:24.564]  To try to chronicle the horrible job this government has done is daunting.
[00:14:24.584 --> 00:14:26.225]  But we're going to go to your calls here in just one moment.
[00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:27.166]  J.W.
[00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:33.410]  in Louisiana, Charles in Louisiana, Kevin in Austin, Texas, Mike in Maryland, many, many others.
[00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:40.053]  We're going to get a report from Louisiana later from Dwayne Cooch, an IT man who lives there in Louisiana.
[00:14:41.935 --> 00:14:45.997]  And we are also going to have Paul Craig Roberts on today.
[00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:48.743]  Coming up in 45 minutes.
[00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:59.471]  And Paul Craig Roberts, of course, was the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Department during the Reagan administration.
[00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:03.494]  Number two at the Treasury Department.
[00:15:04.574 --> 00:15:09.218]  And he's one of the most conservative men from the Reagan administration.
[00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:11.079]  Won many awards.
[00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:12.800]  He's about as conservative as you get.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.223]  And he's calling for Bush's immediate impeachment.
[00:15:16.969 --> 00:15:21.050]  For what happened with the dikes and levees and dams.
[00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:22.831]  The barriers.
[00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:25.832]  So many names for the same thing.
[00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:28.752]  A rose is still a rose by any other name.
[00:15:29.153 --> 00:15:33.754]  The dikes, the levees, people keep using all different terms for it.
[00:15:35.694 --> 00:15:41.496]  The barriers, the walls, the shields are from the Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi.
[00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:44.017]  But what we do know is this.
[00:15:46.573 --> 00:16:13.935]  The picture, the area of the picture that is emerging is that the government knew exactly what it was doing, and that to maintain total centralized control of the situation, they deliberately, because they'd war-gamed, it turns out, many, many times this exact scenario, FEMA, Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, they had all war-gamed...
[00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:16.538]  We're good to go.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:17:00.791]  That Bush, the first few days as this was unfolding, as the world was learning the full scope, was still going to rock concerts and playing the guitar and taking two naps a day and riding his bike for three hours.
[00:17:01.932 --> 00:17:03.033]  The life of a dilettante.
[00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:10.439]  And we know that Todd and Lisa Rice, as late as Thursday night was at plays...
[00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:11.715]  We're good to go.
[00:17:11.735 --> 00:17:12.116]  We're good to go.
[00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:33.963]  And so we know that they seem totally calm and at ease like nothing had happened.
[00:17:34.503 --> 00:17:49.307]  Now we've learned that behind the scenes Dick Cheney was getting briefings and Bush was getting briefings and they were specifically hands-on themselves handing out the contracts.
[00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:57.570]  And that's one of the big reasons everything was held up because they didn't let their minions make the decisions
[00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:01.991]  It was being micromanaged as to who got the contracts.
[00:18:02.552 --> 00:18:07.476]  And folks, who do you think got a lot of the big contracts all over the Gulf Coast?
[00:18:09.097 --> 00:18:23.589]  Back last Wednesday, I told my webmaster, Ryan Slickheisen for Infowars.com, I said, take that picture of Bush looking out the window of Air Force One and put over it, put over it,
[00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:25.661]  Gee, you know, a thought bubble.
[00:18:25.842 --> 00:18:35.305]  Gee, I wonder if I can get away with giving the repair contracts to Halliburton.
[00:18:37.585 --> 00:18:46.168]  Or maybe I can just leave Louisiana destroyed like I did Iraq for 13 years, like my father in Clinton did.
[00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:48.569]  So we posted that.
[00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:58.856]  And then lo and behold, we find out on Friday from the Houston Chronicle, now on the Washington Post, no bid contracts to Halliburton.
[00:19:01.178 --> 00:19:03.860]  So they're actually profiting from it.
[00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:05.041]  Directly.
[00:19:06.783 --> 00:19:16.171]  And now the Army Times is reporting, this is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, the Army Times is reporting right now
[00:19:17.822 --> 00:19:26.890]  That they are calling the people inside New Orleans combatants.
[00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.152]  They're calling them terrorists.
[00:19:30.173 --> 00:19:35.357]  And namely, in one article I saw, they are calling them insurgents.
[00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:38.420]  Insurgents.
[00:19:40.442 --> 00:19:45.326]  And they're openly erasing the last vestiges of Posse Comitatus.
[00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.473]  We'll come back, and we'll go straight to J.W., Charles, Kevin, Mike, and others.
[00:19:51.655 --> 00:19:59.302]  And this is just such a big picture, it's hard to articulate all of it, but we'll cover it all.
[00:19:59.342 --> 00:19:59.763]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:06.846]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of different medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:08.767]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:11.609]  Yes, I said drinking water, but not just any water.
[00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:16.072]  You need electrolyzed oxidized water, or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:20:16.172 --> 00:20:25.358]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:26.339]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:40.755]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:05.862]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:21:06.222 --> 00:21:15.031]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:20.036]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:20.496 --> 00:21:27.221]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:39.411]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:39.871 --> 00:21:44.334]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:46.836]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:48.817]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:52.619]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.743]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:22:06.043 --> 00:22:09.566]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:22:49.766 --> 00:22:55.107]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:22:58.889 --> 00:22:59.784]  We're good.
[00:23:02.978 --> 00:23:06.099]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:13.161]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:26.945]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:23:27.285 --> 00:23:31.026]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:23:31.226 --> 00:23:31.826]  Thank you.
[00:23:31.866 --> 00:23:32.307]  Thank you.
[00:23:32.327 --> 00:23:32.687]  Thank you.
[00:24:04.273 --> 00:24:10.294]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:13.895]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.876 --> 00:24:29.578]  By the way, two-thirds of the police just walked off the job the day after the hurricane hit as the city filled with water.
[00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:55.893]  And then they claim that they were just out looting the police to supply themselves, but we've got several newscasts where they actually catch the police with shopping carts full of radios and shoes and clothes and electronics goods, video games.
[00:24:55.973 --> 00:24:56.854]  They're just stealing.
[00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.851]  Which is human nature.
[00:25:00.012 --> 00:25:07.098]  I mean, even our revolutionary forces in 1776 weren't as bad as the British, but they did loot.
[00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:10.361]  I mean, that's what power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:25:10.641 --> 00:25:14.124]  My point is the government can't save you, isn't going to save you, doesn't want to save you.
[00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:22.312]  And you notice they had enough police there to search people and make sure they didn't have guns getting into the Superdome.
[00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:28.794]  And the criminals just snuck guns in, the police evacuated, and then the criminals got to go around raping and killing.
[00:25:29.414 --> 00:25:32.756]  Whereas if there had just been a few good people with guns, none of this would have happened.
[00:25:33.236 --> 00:25:36.838]  So again, the cops say, we can't protect you, we won't protect you.
[00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:42.941]  Almost all the federal and state rulings say that it's not their job to protect you.
[00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:43.902]  Did you know that?
[00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:46.403]  They're there to respond after a crime.
[00:25:46.823 --> 00:25:50.065]  They have no obligation to protect you, but they sure want your gun.
[00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:53.976]  They're even trying to ban citizens getting tasers now.
[00:25:54.577 --> 00:25:57.403]  So you can't protect yourself and I'm not going to protect you.
[00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:00.288]  And notice, they won't give you any help.
[00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:03.515]  I mean, if all you've got is a quarter tank of gas...
[00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.770]  No money.
[00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:13.253]  You've had enough money to drive out of New Orleans in your SUV or in your van with your four kids to the Superdome or to the Astrodome.
[00:26:13.813 --> 00:26:16.034]  They say, sorry, you've got to give up everything.
[00:26:16.134 --> 00:26:18.935]  Sign yourselves over to us as wards of the state.
[00:26:19.335 --> 00:26:26.997]  And I guarantee you, folks, the Child Protective Services is grabbing kids left and right because they're carrying ears to any weak population they're going to be feeding on.
[00:26:27.177 --> 00:26:28.118]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[00:26:28.138 --> 00:26:29.438]  There's so many facets.
[00:26:29.978 --> 00:26:32.760]  J.W., Charles, Kevin, Mike, Scott, Sean, we're going to go to you all.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:33.861]  J.W.
[00:26:33.901 --> 00:26:35.382]  in Louisiana, welcome.
[00:26:35.642 --> 00:26:36.723]  What's your report for us?
[00:26:37.023 --> 00:26:37.943]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:38.484]  Hi.
[00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:40.905]  Where do you want me to begin?
[00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:44.728]  Just compare what's really happening locally.
[00:26:44.748 --> 00:26:53.073]  You've been calling us from Baton Rouge the last week to what's in the national news and the reports you're getting from the police and others that you're talking to.
[00:26:53.093 --> 00:26:54.174]  Okay.
[00:26:54.494 --> 00:26:56.415]  First of all, you're correct in what you're saying.
[00:26:56.495 --> 00:26:58.677]  Over 200 New Orleans police...
[00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:00.225]  Have resigned.
[00:27:00.425 --> 00:27:02.126]  That is pretty much verifiable.
[00:27:02.486 --> 00:27:04.208]  Two has committed suicide.
[00:27:04.228 --> 00:27:12.554]  It's going to take, from my understanding, 40 to 80 days to pump New Orleans dry.
[00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:17.117]  The list is endless.
[00:27:17.197 --> 00:27:20.079]  Like I say, I've got about eight directions I can go in.
[00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:22.001]  You can take me wherever you need me to go.
[00:27:24.102 --> 00:27:24.823]  Just run down them.
[00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:26.240]  Okay.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.644]  Well, first of all, I've studied maps over the weekend.
[00:27:29.664 --> 00:27:32.467]  25% of Louisiana has been impacted by this storm.
[00:27:33.028 --> 00:27:36.792]  I figure the approximate number of people is close to 3 million.
[00:27:36.852 --> 00:27:42.719]  You've got 13 to 14 parishes that are either devastated totally or devastated.
[00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:46.067]  Have various degrees of devastation.
[00:27:46.087 --> 00:27:49.249]  And the rest of the state is overrun with refugees.
[00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:50.230]  This is correct.
[00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:56.994]  You have the northern parishes from New Orleans that go up to the northeast, like Washington Parish, St.
[00:27:57.014 --> 00:28:05.459]  Tammany Parish, which are more rural parishes, that the news media is not, they've overlooked them completely and thrown them to the wolves.
[00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:08.161]  These people are in dire straits up there.
[00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:10.062]  So it's not just the New Orleans area.
[00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:14.076]  You have Orleans Parish, you have Jefferson Parish, St.
[00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:17.978]  Charles Parish, Lafourche Parish, the fishing industry.
[00:28:18.578 --> 00:28:24.500]  I figure at least a third of the fishing industry of Louisiana is out.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.781]  That's commercial and sport fishing.
[00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:33.664]  The oil and gas, Empire, Venice, Buras, all down through there.
[00:28:33.704 --> 00:28:37.445]  Boutique is where they use the staging areas for the oil and gas industry.
[00:28:37.505 --> 00:28:39.086]  Completely devastated.
[00:28:41.402 --> 00:28:44.924]  Jesus, Alex, it's just unbelievable.
[00:28:46.644 --> 00:28:50.006]  What about your city with the refugees?
[00:28:50.706 --> 00:28:51.646]  Any problems there?
[00:28:51.946 --> 00:28:58.469]  Well, Baton Rouge is, I would say, holding up rather well, but I don't know how long it's going to last.
[00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:07.793]  The reports are really... The local news coverage is...
[00:29:09.148 --> 00:29:11.109]  It's down planning to some degree.
[00:29:11.209 --> 00:29:15.712]  My understanding, well, of course, we've got gas lines, if you can even find gas.
[00:29:15.832 --> 00:29:19.995]  And they've lined up 50, 60 deep at the major filling stations.
[00:29:21.996 --> 00:29:26.479]  But everything you've said is correct thus far about what is happening in New Orleans.
[00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:27.340]  I have a story.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.541]  I hear the break coming up.
[00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:29.822]  Yeah, real quick on the other side.
[00:29:29.862 --> 00:29:30.742]  Finish up, J.W.
[00:29:30.762 --> 00:29:32.683]  Just get to the most important stuff you've got for us.
[00:29:33.124 --> 00:29:36.566]  Then we'll go to Charles, also in Louisiana, Kevin, Mike, and many others.
[00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:41.311]  And as soon as you hear one caller leave us, it's your chance to call in 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:48.874]  I haven't gotten into the martial law scenario and how this affects the U.S.
[00:29:48.934 --> 00:29:49.374]  economy.
[00:29:49.394 --> 00:29:49.854]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.215 --> 00:29:53.156]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.616 --> 00:29:55.216]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.137 --> 00:29:58.818]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.879 --> 00:30:08.682]  The fifth annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:08.882 --> 00:30:11.423]  Door prizes, free drawings, and non-stop fun.
[00:30:11.703 --> 00:30:12.504]  Featuring the Ms.
[00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:20.708]  Minnesota Senior Pageant, Dr. Dale Anderson, who prescribes laughter for health, the Plymouth Playhouse Church Basement Ladies, the Silver Sneakers, and more.
[00:30:21.148 --> 00:30:25.512]  Learn all about the new Medicare prescription plan from the Social Security Administration.
[00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:26.673]  See a fashion show.
[00:30:26.953 --> 00:30:29.495]  Have fun with the bees and Mariner and the Magic Men.
[00:30:29.756 --> 00:30:31.297]  There's something new every hour.
[00:30:31.317 --> 00:30:35.240]  All this, plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.023]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:42.166]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:43.547 --> 00:30:47.973]  For discount tickets, visit 101expos.com or call 612-798-7256.
[00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:57.024]  Sponsored in part by Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, KSTC, KSTP, Medica, and Ebenezer.
[00:30:57.305 --> 00:31:00.449]  Save the date September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[00:31:02.006 --> 00:31:08.228]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:14.551]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:23.274]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:30.537]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.837 --> 00:31:35.660]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:41.284]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.624 --> 00:31:44.706]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:53.012]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:02.098 --> 00:32:04.459]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:08.560]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:08.881 --> 00:32:09.701]  Read the labels.
[00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:14.243]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:14.463 --> 00:32:18.645]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:19.025 --> 00:32:23.907]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:24.287 --> 00:32:27.889]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:33.393]  It's all-natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra-virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[00:33:02.774 --> 00:33:05.496]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:09.438]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.639 --> 00:33:15.021]  America is being trained how to be good little slaves.
[00:33:16.622 --> 00:33:21.826]  How to relinquish all control over your life and go under federal control.
[00:33:23.687 --> 00:33:26.388]  The federal government for several days held back and did nothing.
[00:33:26.408 --> 00:33:28.289]  The state government completely collapsed.
[00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:30.611]  The local government...
[00:33:31.187 --> 00:33:32.568]  Completely collapsed.
[00:33:33.449 --> 00:33:35.711]  And then the military is being praised.
[00:33:35.771 --> 00:33:37.392]  Man, they ought to run everything.
[00:33:37.412 --> 00:33:38.253]  Wow!
[00:33:38.693 --> 00:33:40.455]  They got some buses in.
[00:33:40.855 --> 00:33:42.917]  Wow, they got some food and water in.
[00:33:42.937 --> 00:33:46.360]  Folks, it was the military under orders of FEMA.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.425]  This is all mainstream, but again, back of the paper, that wouldn't let food and water get in for at least...
[00:33:53.027 --> 00:33:53.747]  Three days.
[00:33:54.328 --> 00:33:55.949]  That held everybody back.
[00:33:56.029 --> 00:34:01.052]  That held the people back that wanted to come in with their boats and rescue.
[00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:10.057]  And we have police captains going public and mayors going public and we have military men going public.
[00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:14.720]  I mean, it's not a secret, but still it should be the main focus.
[00:34:15.584 --> 00:34:21.546]  After the Continual Rescue is to just show how this government is not heroic.
[00:34:21.966 --> 00:34:23.947]  This government has not done a good job.
[00:34:24.287 --> 00:34:25.767]  They've done a horrible job.
[00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:35.870]  And the base stuff that governments traditionally are supposed to do is build stuff like dams and maintain levees.
[00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.231]  And that has not been done.
[00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:45.213]  It's specifically... It isn't just like Bush sucked this money off into some other area of the budget.
[00:34:45.968 --> 00:34:51.513]  No, it specifically went for his no-bid contracts and the rest of it in Iraq.
[00:34:52.353 --> 00:34:54.675]  And now Halliburton's going to get it coming and going.
[00:34:55.115 --> 00:34:57.657]  Now Halliburton's going to get money here for doing this.
[00:34:58.898 --> 00:35:01.080]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:35:02.481 --> 00:35:14.431]  Now, there were 100-plus companies that could have done the work that Halliburton did in Iraq, but they claimed no bid because only Halliburton can do it.
[00:35:15.057 --> 00:35:23.785]  Now, clearly, they've got a lot of oil field equipment, a lot of trucks, and a lot of employees, and a lot of engineers that, frankly, are in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
[00:35:24.065 --> 00:35:26.387]  So I could see Halliburton getting a few of the jobs.
[00:35:26.788 --> 00:35:29.951]  But under federal law, they're not supposed to because of conflict of interest.
[00:35:31.252 --> 00:35:34.395]  The point is, it's just so obvious.
[00:35:35.624 --> 00:35:37.025]  And it's so disgusting.
[00:35:37.045 --> 00:35:45.628]  But I'm going to get into this posse commentatus martial law situation and what was really behind the looting and how the police are literally leading the looting.
[00:35:45.988 --> 00:35:48.930]  Paul Craig Roberts is coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.852]  Former Deputy Treasury Secretary to talk about this whole situation.
[00:35:54.312 --> 00:35:55.632]  But right now, let's...
[00:35:56.253 --> 00:35:57.833]  J.W., finish up your report.
[00:35:58.534 --> 00:35:58.774]  What do...
[00:36:00.123 --> 00:36:05.745]  What are people saying about Bush's now admitted photo op that was staged with the governor?
[00:36:06.045 --> 00:36:10.527]  What are they saying about the clear evidence that the government didn't repair the levees?
[00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:22.292]  What are they saying about the lack of response and for some reason not bringing food and water to those people and then making the breakdown of society many times worse?
[00:36:23.012 --> 00:36:26.294]  Well, that seems to be the topic of conversation in Baton Rouge.
[00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:35.073]  For example, Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, he is pointing the finger at the governor of our state.
[00:36:35.133 --> 00:36:39.795]  And, of course, the governor is passing the buck on up the lines of Bush and his administration.
[00:36:39.835 --> 00:36:40.735]  But I'm going to give you examples.
[00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:42.776]  And then Bush is blaming the locals.
[00:36:42.836 --> 00:36:43.597]  That is correct.
[00:36:43.617 --> 00:36:48.299]  But Ray Nagin is running around in a T-shirt and jeans with about a five-day growth beard.
[00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:50.243]  But yet he shaves his head.
[00:36:50.664 --> 00:36:51.965]  His head is smooth shaven.
[00:36:52.005 --> 00:36:53.866]  I've seen him a number of times on TV.
[00:36:54.647 --> 00:37:01.112]  It is strictly the blame game is being pointed, but honestly and truly, it starts with the mayor of New Orleans.
[00:37:01.132 --> 00:37:02.193]  You know, that's a good point.
[00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.715]  So this is part of his new costume.
[00:37:04.795 --> 00:37:05.616]  This is correct.
[00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:06.697]  That is exactly right.
[00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:13.543]  As far as the looting involving the police, I have a story that appeared on our local Channel 9 here in Baton Rouge.
[00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:17.770]  The reporters were interviewing some people in a hotel.
[00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:22.395]  There's 20 people holed up in a hotel who would not allow themselves to be evacuated.
[00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:31.125]  The reason being that the police, NOPD, was holed up in an adjacent apartment complex to the hotel on the 10th floor...
[00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:42.800]  With looted goods, and when a Channel 9 news reporter went to the 10th floor and approached them, they were met at gunpoint by the New Orleans, several New Orleans police.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:48.644]  That's the top story, and we have a news report out of Louisiana on that.
[00:37:49.024 --> 00:38:02.093]  We have several ABC and CBS reports that aren't as bad, but for those that just missed that, the police are leading the looting, and they are actually sitting on top treasure chests,
[00:38:02.657 --> 00:38:12.700]  Refusing to leave their goodies and guaranteed they're not going to send the license to kill troops in to fight the real insurgents.
[00:38:13.181 --> 00:38:17.342]  And as usual, the insurgents are the police.
[00:38:17.882 --> 00:38:20.704]  The insurgents are the government.
[00:38:21.044 --> 00:38:23.946]  Read your history books, and then this wouldn't be surprising.
[00:38:24.206 --> 00:38:27.969]  But because we don't know history, it is not surprising.
[00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:29.590]  I mean, it is surprising.
[00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.793]  Now, do me a favor here, J.W., because I've got a report on this, but I want to track down the TV news piece of this.
[00:38:35.154 --> 00:38:36.375]  I want to find it online.
[00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:40.317]  And John, running the board right now, instant message this to my producer.
[00:38:40.697 --> 00:38:47.602]  If she is not listening, I want this found and posted on InfoWars and Prison Planet, along with the other police looting sections.
[00:38:48.964 --> 00:38:53.809]  J.W., very slowly, give us the TV station, when this happened, and the specifics.
[00:38:54.230 --> 00:39:04.081]  It's W-A-F-B W-A-F-B Channel 9 Channel 9 in Baton Rouge Baton Rouge It's the CBS affiliate.
[00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:05.646]  Yep.
[00:39:05.766 --> 00:39:08.868]  I believe I'd given you those numbers Friday.
[00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:11.529]  Yes, but specifically describe exactly.
[00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:17.253]  I've got a text report just saying that they went in to evacuate people and police named guns at them.
[00:39:17.493 --> 00:39:20.594]  But, of course, nationally we're going to get a whitewash.
[00:39:20.934 --> 00:39:22.896]  Specifically, what did they show on the news?
[00:39:23.176 --> 00:39:27.518]  They showed the local reporter interviewing the people in the hotel.
[00:39:27.758 --> 00:39:29.639]  There was 20 of them approximately.
[00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:31.220]  They said they feared for their life.
[00:39:31.738 --> 00:39:32.278]  We're good to go.
[00:40:01.792 --> 00:40:08.458]  The Channel 9 reporter went up and confronted them, and the police did come out.
[00:40:08.838 --> 00:40:11.060]  They identified themselves as NOPD.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:18.646]  They wasn't in uniform, but they did identify themselves that they were NOPD, and the news reporters were met at gunpoint.
[00:40:18.947 --> 00:40:19.547]  Are you kidding?
[00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:22.069]  We've got a national anchor.
[00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.031]  We've got video on Prison Planet.
[00:40:24.391 --> 00:40:26.313]  In a Walmart, as the police are looting...
[00:40:27.248 --> 00:40:32.273]  And they're not looting Twinkies and, you know, goldfish to eat.
[00:40:32.974 --> 00:40:35.936]  For those who don't know, goldfish, you know, cheese crackers.
[00:40:36.277 --> 00:40:39.740]  Point is, they're not in there doing that, folks.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.541]  They're loading up on all the goodies.
[00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:47.007]  It shows the women cops in there basically shopping, you know, holding up dresses, basically.
[00:40:47.267 --> 00:40:48.188]  I've seen the report.
[00:40:48.248 --> 00:40:51.971]  I have the Baton Rouge Advocate, the newspaper.
[00:40:52.011 --> 00:40:52.412]  I have the...
[00:40:53.453 --> 00:40:56.175]  The website, if any of your listeners would care to go to it.
[00:40:56.195 --> 00:40:57.796]  Are they reporting on the looting?
[00:40:58.536 --> 00:41:01.678]  I haven't seen the newspaper today, so I can't comment on that.
[00:41:01.718 --> 00:41:02.198]  What's the website?
[00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:03.940]  But I would assume that they are.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.001]  Well, this is just unbelievable.
[00:41:06.241 --> 00:41:07.562]  Baton Rouge Advocate, we can find that.
[00:41:07.922 --> 00:41:13.986]  No, I mean, I do have a report that their New Orleans police held up in a building that won't leave.
[00:41:14.306 --> 00:41:17.328]  I mean, they must really have some valuable goodies to...
[00:41:18.201 --> 00:41:20.383]  To be willing to aim guns at camera people.
[00:41:20.723 --> 00:41:29.991]  Well, I don't want to paint all the New Orleans police with a broad brush, but are you aware of the incident that took place on the 17th Street Bridge yesterday afternoon?
[00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:31.352]  Well, there's so many.
[00:41:31.472 --> 00:41:32.853]  Fill me in.
[00:41:33.033 --> 00:41:37.137]  The New Orleans police killed six snipers.
[00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:42.481]  What was happening, that's where one of the dikes is broken.
[00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:47.425]  At the 17th Street, the construction crew contractors were in there working.
[00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:53.784]  Eight people was up on the bridge firing at the contractors while they were attempting to repair the break in the dike.
[00:41:54.264 --> 00:41:55.446]  Now, why on earth?
[00:41:56.126 --> 00:41:57.248]  I did see that report.
[00:41:58.029 --> 00:42:02.394]  Well, no, obviously there are a lot of firefighters and police that are heroes, but...
[00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:09.854]  Just like in the Revolutionary War, I mean, most of our troops weren't looting, but it always becomes a problem.
[00:42:10.234 --> 00:42:17.458]  My point is that government isn't going to save you, can't save you, won't save you, and I'm wondering why we're seeing a media cover-up on all of this.
[00:42:18.338 --> 00:42:19.639]  Yes, I do have a blurb here.
[00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:22.361]  There was a shootout there at the bridge.
[00:42:23.581 --> 00:42:24.982]  Do we know who these people were?
[00:42:25.997 --> 00:42:26.597]  No, we don't.
[00:42:26.717 --> 00:42:28.918]  I'm assuming they were just looters.
[00:42:29.518 --> 00:42:32.359]  There's no way I could tell you why they did.
[00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:33.780]  That's pretty strategic.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.321]  Your average looter isn't going to try to keep the levee open.
[00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:40.382]  I do have a report changing the subject only slightly.
[00:42:40.422 --> 00:42:42.002]  I do have a report about a nurse.
[00:42:42.242 --> 00:42:47.204]  He's a male on our end working at the Louis Armstrong Airport.
[00:42:47.804 --> 00:42:54.046]  He lived in New Orleans, had to leave his home, and he volunteered to work at the airport on the refugees.
[00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:56.361]  He had been there for a number of days.
[00:42:57.462 --> 00:42:58.342]  FEMA come in.
[00:42:58.922 --> 00:43:04.283]  They've taken over the airport and now they're using out of the staging area for the extremely sick and ill.
[00:43:04.704 --> 00:43:06.404]  He had been there and donated his time.
[00:43:06.544 --> 00:43:10.985]  When FEMA come in and took over, they told him his services was no longer needed to go home.
[00:43:12.365 --> 00:43:15.306]  He told them, quote, I don't have a home to go to.
[00:43:15.466 --> 00:43:17.067]  He was volunteering his services.
[00:43:17.427 --> 00:43:20.748]  He says they come in, set up, and sit down.
[00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:22.528]  That is a quote he used.
[00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:31.412]  Well, FEMA is designed... I mean, it's been on the record where they just tell hurricane victims, help me, help me, and he goes, look, lady, you're going to die.
[00:43:31.452 --> 00:43:32.052]  Just go die.
[00:43:32.432 --> 00:43:39.555]  Oh, there's numerous reports about... I know two people personally went down to volunteer their services with boats.
[00:43:39.755 --> 00:43:48.819]  These are credentialed law enforcement personnel from adjacent parishes who went down at their own expense and was either turned away...
[00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:53.526]  Are told who and how many people they can pick up and where to go to do this.
[00:43:53.907 --> 00:43:54.868]  It's unbelievable.
[00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:01.697]  And again, you can't have maybe 20 FEMA coordinators telling tens of thousands of people.
[00:44:02.729 --> 00:44:18.741]  And I've got the same reports where you've got people that have got special forces backgrounds who are, you know, sergeants in the police department, and they bring their own boats in, and they just are told, no, you can't go, or they tell them, okay, you can only go to this one area and see if you find anybody.
[00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:21.763]  Again, you cannot micromanage things like this.
[00:44:22.223 --> 00:44:30.309]  Well, that's correct, and I've heard those stories from people that I know personally, but let me give you another heads up on what's going on here in the Baton Rouge area.
[00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:32.930]  The housing market has gone through the roof.
[00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:38.791]  A house that was selling for $80,000 two weeks ago is selling for $200,000 today.
[00:44:38.951 --> 00:44:40.312]  I've got that report as well.
[00:44:40.652 --> 00:44:45.073]  People are being moved, evicted out of their apartments.
[00:44:45.673 --> 00:44:53.956]  Month-to-month leases, they're being evicted out of their apartments so complexes can, of course, double, triple, quadruple the rent.
[00:44:54.676 --> 00:44:57.917]  One New Orleans businessman who was not identified
[00:44:58.792 --> 00:45:06.977]  purchased 14 homes in the Baton Rouge area for his employees, which is great, and I understand it, but the housing market has gone through the roof.
[00:45:07.017 --> 00:45:09.759]  You won't be able to... All right, continue to give us reports.
[00:45:09.819 --> 00:45:12.961]  I want to get some other reports, J.W., but always very good reports.
[00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:16.483]  We appreciate you calling in and spending your time, and God bless you.
[00:45:16.664 --> 00:45:17.004]  Thank you.
[00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:22.808]  All right, folks, we spent about 15, 20 minutes with J.W., and we're going to go to Charles and Kevin, everybody here right now.
[00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:24.889]  It's just, this is so important.
[00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.791]  And the point is...
[00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:33.534]  I'm not saying the police are bad, but they're just like the general public.
[00:45:35.056 --> 00:45:37.718]  And about 20% of them are going to be criminal, folks.
[00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:39.740]  I mean, it's really simple.
[00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:52.032]  In fact, history and statistics show that you even get a higher percentage of control freaks and criminals and psychopaths and sociopaths and people that want to exercise power, bullies,
[00:45:53.419 --> 00:46:00.942]  That whole gamut of unsavory types I just mentioned, they gravitate towards positions of power.
[00:46:01.482 --> 00:46:11.106]  Also, well-meaning individuals who do care about community and have a sense of duty, they also gravitate towards being police and things like that.
[00:46:13.967 --> 00:46:17.548]  So you've got the best people in the police departments, and you've got the worst people.
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.240]  In the police departments.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.941]  And the Founding Fathers talked about this.
[00:46:20.961 --> 00:46:23.342]  I mean, these were scholars.
[00:46:23.422 --> 00:46:24.942]  These were incredibly intelligent men.
[00:46:25.602 --> 00:46:28.523]  They talked about how you're going to get the best and worst out of government.
[00:46:28.923 --> 00:46:29.884]  Generally the worst.
[00:46:29.984 --> 00:46:32.545]  And that's why you've got to bind the hands of government.
[00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:34.885]  Because it will then get out of control.
[00:46:36.106 --> 00:46:40.287]  And I don't know how Bush politically can survive this.
[00:46:40.447 --> 00:46:42.047]  I mean, I just do not know.
[00:46:42.748 --> 00:46:46.529]  Bare minimum, he is a vacationing fool.
[00:46:47.631 --> 00:46:50.614]  Who continued vacationing three days into this disaster.
[00:46:52.375 --> 00:46:53.216]  Bare minimum.
[00:46:54.477 --> 00:46:57.820]  And just did a horrible job and thousands died as a result.
[00:46:59.261 --> 00:47:11.411]  And the evidence is showing, they were so busy deciding who to give these bids to, we're talking about a $100 billion repair bill over the next year, that that's what held things up.
[00:47:12.812 --> 00:47:12.933]  And...
[00:47:15.006 --> 00:47:16.966]  I mean, rarely am I speechless.
[00:47:17.086 --> 00:47:17.587]  I just don't.
[00:47:17.687 --> 00:47:18.727]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:47:19.147 --> 00:47:20.427]  Charles in Louisiana.
[00:47:20.647 --> 00:47:21.868]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:47:21.888 --> 00:47:22.608]  Go ahead, Charles.
[00:47:24.448 --> 00:47:29.189]  Well, number one is, everything I say, go to WBRZ Channel 2.
[00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.910]  The guys on the bridge had guns.
[00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.010]  They didn't shoot at the people.
[00:47:35.371 --> 00:47:38.231]  I was down as close as I could get.
[00:47:38.491 --> 00:47:41.552]  What five guys are going to attack a military?
[00:47:42.202 --> 00:47:45.565]  They were carrying guns, but everybody's got to carry guns in New Orleans.
[00:47:45.585 --> 00:47:46.445]  There's so much crime.
[00:47:46.846 --> 00:47:48.287]  Well, that's another thing.
[00:47:48.447 --> 00:47:57.013]  They're saying anybody who has a gun is bad, but obviously the military should just go after people that are looting or shooting guns at people.
[00:47:57.133 --> 00:47:58.635]  Well, Mr. Jones, check this out.
[00:47:59.235 --> 00:48:08.182]  Carl Walker, Wal-Mart, or any gun store, they've got an audience, I don't know if it's still guys who's fighting, that we can't buy bullets to defend ourselves.
[00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.371]  We have incidents down here.
[00:48:10.832 --> 00:48:13.452]  Willie Graves got on television and said, take no more.
[00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:15.173]  No more of the people from New Orleans.
[00:48:15.253 --> 00:48:16.293]  I can't control it.
[00:48:17.193 --> 00:48:18.693]  We're having a lot of incidents.
[00:48:18.954 --> 00:48:20.934]  Please don't take no more of the people in.
[00:48:21.494 --> 00:48:22.975]  Then we go try to protect ourselves.
[00:48:22.995 --> 00:48:23.375]  That's right.
[00:48:23.635 --> 00:48:24.115]  That's right.
[00:48:24.395 --> 00:48:26.055]  They are not selling bullets right now.
[00:48:26.075 --> 00:48:26.495]  That's right.
[00:48:26.515 --> 00:48:27.296]  They've got an audience.
[00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:32.497]  But we did get... We did have... Bullets were passed out to everybody.
[00:48:33.417 --> 00:48:36.398]  My cousin was robbed right into a dollar store.
[00:48:36.986 --> 00:48:42.910]  A little 15-year-old boy, him and his friend, guy took his wallet right in the middle of a dollar store down here.
[00:48:43.391 --> 00:48:45.032]  Women are being insulted and all that.
[00:48:45.412 --> 00:48:46.253]  But let me explain this.
[00:48:46.273 --> 00:48:47.474]  Now, was this an armed robbery?
[00:48:48.014 --> 00:48:49.155]  No, it was a strong armory.
[00:48:49.676 --> 00:48:50.876]  Just reached into his pocket.
[00:48:50.916 --> 00:48:51.737]  He was only 15 years old.
[00:48:51.757 --> 00:48:52.017]  Okay.
[00:48:52.558 --> 00:48:52.918]  Okay.
[00:48:53.258 --> 00:48:57.341]  And then Willie Grazer's saying, he's on television, check it out where I told you.
[00:48:57.481 --> 00:48:58.282]  We can't take no more.
[00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.523]  They won't give us the security.
[00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:04.867]  They wanted chaos down here, and they didn't want the people here to defend themselves.
[00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:06.228]  He actually said that.
[00:49:07.066 --> 00:49:09.088]  WBRZ.
[00:49:09.648 --> 00:49:14.151]  You're telling me the mayor of your town... No, not the mayor, the sheriff.
[00:49:14.692 --> 00:49:16.453]  The sheriff said they wanted chaos.
[00:49:16.993 --> 00:49:23.458]  No, no, he said that we can't... I'm saying they want... He said we can't, he's having incidents.
[00:49:23.878 --> 00:49:25.119]  He can't take no more people.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.702]  So people started going by bullets and they wouldn't sell the bullets to us.
[00:49:31.104 --> 00:49:31.384]  I know.
[00:49:31.404 --> 00:49:35.085]  That's why everybody should have their cartridges beforehand.
[00:49:35.265 --> 00:49:35.605]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:35.705 --> 00:49:36.446]  It was the sheriff.
[00:49:36.806 --> 00:49:37.146]  Okay.
[00:49:37.386 --> 00:49:41.267]  Now, the police up there, they say they steal.
[00:49:41.447 --> 00:49:42.768]  They hit a jewelry store.
[00:49:43.128 --> 00:49:44.628]  It was a jewelry store they hit.
[00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:51.170]  You're talking about the police that are held up in the 10-story building?
[00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:52.471]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.651]  I heard it was a jewelry store.
[00:49:53.671 --> 00:49:54.931]  It got there from another policeman.
[00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:59.293]  And another thing is, people going down there with boats, they're running them back in.
[00:49:59.313 --> 00:50:00.153]  We don't need your help.
[00:50:00.973 --> 00:50:03.875]  Two or three people, it was on the news, WBRZ.
[00:50:04.015 --> 00:50:05.436]  No, I'm fully aware of that.
[00:50:05.516 --> 00:50:11.941]  Yeah, okay, and they said, they went and got 10 or 12 people, and they said there's 20 more up there, and the police told them, leave them there.
[00:50:13.002 --> 00:50:14.382]  The police, it's on the news.
[00:50:14.743 --> 00:50:16.284]  Leave them there, don't go get them.
[00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:20.066]  Now, let's be specific.
[00:50:20.146 --> 00:50:22.887]  On your local news, and then you talked to a police officer.
[00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:23.867]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:24.227 --> 00:50:27.369]  Specifically about police robbing jewelry stores.
[00:50:27.469 --> 00:50:29.470]  Well, I heard it was a jewelry store.
[00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:33.592]  There were shoes and all up there in a generator, but there was jewelry, too.
[00:50:35.112 --> 00:50:36.753]  And nothing's going to happen to those police?
[00:50:38.494 --> 00:50:39.955]  Well, they don't know if it was police.
[00:50:39.995 --> 00:50:40.955]  They claim to be police.
[00:50:40.975 --> 00:50:42.396]  They didn't have no uniforms on.
[00:50:43.576 --> 00:50:45.957]  They were guarding the door and threatening the people in the...
[00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:51.136]  So it may not even be police.
[00:50:51.216 --> 00:50:54.244]  I've just got video of police in uniform, stealing.
[00:50:55.063 --> 00:50:55.443]  Goodies.
[00:50:56.523 --> 00:50:56.923]  Stay there.
[00:50:56.943 --> 00:50:58.924]  I'll let you finish up briefly on the other side.
[00:50:58.984 --> 00:51:00.124]  Charles, we'll take more calls.
[00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:01.564]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.124 --> 00:51:02.604]  Hey, folks.
[00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:03.685]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.825 --> 00:51:06.925]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:07.045 --> 00:51:10.966]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:11.006 --> 00:51:15.287]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.587 --> 00:51:19.348]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.488 --> 00:51:21.248]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.468 --> 00:51:24.789]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:29.551]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.712 --> 00:51:32.733]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.933 --> 00:51:35.794]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:36.274 --> 00:51:42.397]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.917 --> 00:51:44.338]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:01.505 --> 00:52:09.028]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.288 --> 00:52:20.213]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.473 --> 00:52:36.640]  yet require very little energy that's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive but it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.460]  That's right.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:44.743]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.043 --> 00:52:53.467]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.487 --> 00:52:54.007]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.

[00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:11.927]  Well, fixing in combat operations in New Orleans to fight the insurgents, that's a quote out of the Army Times.
[00:54:31.573 --> 00:54:43.059]  Yesterday, and meanwhile, the military is going around simply confiscating the firearms of all the citizens, even in their homes, going door to door.
[00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:44.860]  Oh, sorry, you can't have your gun.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:52.504]  Oh, sorry, there's no Second Amendment now because a few bands of people are going around looting, and we know some of them are the police.
[00:54:54.265 --> 00:54:55.725]  Others are posing as the police.
[00:54:56.446 --> 00:54:57.546]  We've got the guns.
[00:54:59.187 --> 00:55:00.408]  You can't have your guns.
[00:55:02.805 --> 00:55:13.013]  Charles, I remember years ago you calling in talking about local police friends of yours who were saying, well, we've been told a bioweapon attack is coming and we can't have citizens armed during a bioweapon attack.
[00:55:13.053 --> 00:55:14.615]  It would cause riots and problems.
[00:55:15.415 --> 00:55:19.438]  When in truth, an armed population stops riots or at least lessens them.
[00:55:19.478 --> 00:55:26.945]  We saw that with the riots in Los Angeles and the Korean shopkeepers when the police just refused to go into those areas and stood down.
[00:55:27.785 --> 00:55:31.088]  It was the Koreans who finally turned the tide.
[00:55:31.892 --> 00:55:33.994]  The police wouldn't go in and help the firefighters.
[00:55:34.314 --> 00:55:35.836]  This was on national TV.
[00:55:36.396 --> 00:55:43.143]  As the firefighters, who were valiant, were being shot at by scumbags, it was the citizens that started opening fire on them.
[00:55:44.244 --> 00:55:45.425]  You talk about public servants.
[00:55:45.465 --> 00:55:47.187]  I have nothing but respect for our firefighters.
[00:55:47.927 --> 00:55:50.370]  But they're not even allowed in, in many cases, to save people.
[00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.532]  Because FEMA's in control.
[00:55:52.892 --> 00:55:56.816]  Charles, finish up what you were saying, then I'm going to go to Kevin and Mike and Sean and Wes and others.
[00:55:57.216 --> 00:56:01.639]  Why they didn't want the citizens of these parishes to defend themselves?
[00:56:02.179 --> 00:56:03.380]  This is coming down here.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.722]  The 9th Ward's coming and they tell them, you can't buy bullets.
[00:56:07.283 --> 00:56:08.424]  We ain't selling you no bullets.
[00:56:08.884 --> 00:56:10.305]  Why would they do that to us?
[00:56:11.145 --> 00:56:12.126]  They wanted chaos.
[00:56:12.146 --> 00:56:13.187]  They wanted body count.
[00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:24.129]  Landro, she wanted martial law so bad, she had to apologize because she's saying, my troops are ready, locked and loaded, and more than willing to shoot.
[00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.551]  They wanted chaos, Mr. Jones.
[00:56:26.912 --> 00:56:28.113]  Believe me, I tried.
[00:56:28.153 --> 00:56:29.955]  My wife talks to the people in the shelters.
[00:56:30.315 --> 00:56:32.297]  I bring fresh clothes to some policemen.
[00:56:32.657 --> 00:56:35.279]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:56:35.299 --> 00:56:36.480]  I call you all the time.
[00:56:37.021 --> 00:56:38.062]  I want to have a conversation.
[00:56:39.103 --> 00:56:42.926]  It's not what the papers are reporting.
[00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:44.268]  They want a body count.
[00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:47.231]  They want chaos here in other parishes.
[00:56:47.551 --> 00:56:48.011]  Believe me.
[00:56:48.252 --> 00:56:50.574]  And that proves it when you're saying you can't defend yourself.
[00:56:52.702 --> 00:56:54.683]  Well, that's a recipe for disaster.
[00:56:55.263 --> 00:56:58.125]  I had heard they put in some ordinances in different areas.
[00:56:58.165 --> 00:56:59.245]  Yes, yes.
[00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:00.906]  That you can't buy guns or bullets.
[00:57:00.946 --> 00:57:02.187]  That is totally criminal.
[00:57:02.367 --> 00:57:04.368]  I went to the pawn shop right down here.
[00:57:04.608 --> 00:57:05.188]  Wal-Mart.
[00:57:05.248 --> 00:57:06.909]  I went with people trying to get the bullets.
[00:57:07.189 --> 00:57:09.030]  They wouldn't sell it to them, Mr. Jones.
[00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:10.550]  No one is coming out here.
[00:57:10.771 --> 00:57:12.171]  And they're having heavy incidents.
[00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:13.492]  People walking around.
[00:57:13.792 --> 00:57:15.293]  They ain't searching the cars down.
[00:57:15.553 --> 00:57:18.514]  They're seeing the knife wards coming out and the scripts and the bloods and all that.
[00:57:18.794 --> 00:57:20.175]  And we can't defend ourselves?
[00:57:20.515 --> 00:57:21.856]  What kind of government is this?
[00:57:22.737 --> 00:57:30.443]  Well, I've got mainstream news reports here today where they say no guns allowed, but we're not going to protect you.
[00:57:31.023 --> 00:57:33.285]  Well, there's a lot of stories I could tell you.
[00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:34.726]  Basically, they're going to send the U.S.
[00:57:34.806 --> 00:57:36.767]  Army up against you if you don't turn your guns in.
[00:57:36.867 --> 00:57:37.348]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:37.408 --> 00:57:39.169]  That's the freedom of George Bush, folks.
[00:57:39.329 --> 00:57:40.230]  Now, let me explain.
[00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.452]  As if the criminals are going to follow any of these rules.
[00:57:42.672 --> 00:57:43.672]  I talked to one woman.
[00:57:43.692 --> 00:57:45.013]  Let me tell you this one story.
[00:57:46.114 --> 00:57:47.595]  And I talked to her, and I believe her.
[00:57:47.615 --> 00:57:48.396]  She's a good woman.
[00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:50.978]  She was trying to get some bullets.
[00:57:51.038 --> 00:57:52.439]  Her son told her, come get some bullets.
[00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.252]  And I said, what happened in the Dome Stadium?
[00:57:55.272 --> 00:58:02.416]  She said, well, a woman who lives in Gonzales has come back, and I'm going to say it like this, their rates are so bad she couldn't hardly walk.
[00:58:02.816 --> 00:58:03.717]  I said, where's the police?
[00:58:03.737 --> 00:58:05.038]  She said, oh, they were outside.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.421]  Well, they never have protected us.
[00:58:09.461 --> 00:58:10.301]  They never will.
[00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:11.382]  It's not their job.
[00:58:12.122 --> 00:58:14.444]  They'll tell you it's not our job to protect you.
[00:58:15.262 --> 00:58:20.964]  They had vigilantes going right in the Dome Stadium, and the police standing outside, and they're giving these people no protection.
[00:58:21.384 --> 00:58:25.686]  They tell them, we're going to take you... Well, let's be clear, it was vigilantes that killed the rapists.
[00:58:26.626 --> 00:58:29.427]  Well, I don't know, you know... Well, that's been admitted.
[00:58:29.907 --> 00:58:30.848]  Groups of vigilantes.
[00:58:31.188 --> 00:58:32.648]  Well, thank you, Mr. Jones.
[00:58:33.149 --> 00:58:34.069]  Anything else, Charles?
[00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:39.191]  No, I'm just disgusted with it, because it's nothing but lies, and I tell everybody... Well, call in any time you want.
[00:58:39.231 --> 00:58:39.831]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.778 --> 00:58:46.686]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.047 --> 00:58:58.688]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.348 --> 00:59:00.409]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:02.230]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:03.691]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:05.412]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.012 --> 00:59:09.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.195 --> 00:59:14.337]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.798 --> 00:59:21.822]  Well, instead of the military calling the looters criminals, they're calling them terrorists and insurgents.
[00:59:23.735 --> 00:59:40.825]  Combat operations, their job is to go in and confiscate law-abiding citizens that have been stuck, confiscate their guns, that's the vast majority of them, and to ship them out to basically highway junction areas where for days they sit there and are raped and attacked.
[00:59:41.686 --> 00:59:43.347]  It's still continuing all over the state.
[00:59:43.387 --> 00:59:46.509]  There's total battle of murder everywhere, rape everywhere.
[00:59:46.889 --> 00:59:48.850]  They won't sell guns or bullets to anybody.
[00:59:49.831 --> 00:59:53.153]  Police are running all over the place, different criminal gangs of police.
[00:59:53.866 --> 00:59:54.826]  Robbing greedily.
[00:59:57.387 --> 00:59:59.308]  Very, very serious.
[01:00:01.149 --> 01:00:04.130]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:09.492]  We have a former Reagan appointee coming on.
[01:00:09.512 --> 01:00:12.613]  Paul Craig Roberts will talk about the situation in a few minutes.
[01:00:12.993 --> 01:00:14.154]  Kevin in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:14.174 --> 01:00:14.754]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:00:16.695 --> 01:00:17.075]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:17.475]  How you doing?
[01:00:17.855 --> 01:00:18.415]  Good, my friend.
[01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.076]  I've got an audio clip.
[01:00:21.136 --> 01:00:22.697]  Actually, it's a video clip of...
[01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:29.465]  Jefferson Parish President Aaron Brouchard from yesterday morning's Meet the Press with Tim Russert.
[01:00:30.605 --> 01:00:32.967]  I'll play that here in a minute for you, the audio.
[01:00:33.387 --> 01:00:34.768]  But J.W.
[01:00:34.808 --> 01:00:35.928]  was wrong in something.
[01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:42.452]  He's correct that there is a blame game going on and there is grandstanding, but he is in a paradigm that no longer exists.
[01:00:43.213 --> 01:00:46.615]  The mayor is not in control of New Orleans, hasn't been in, what has it been, one or two
[01:00:47.188 --> 01:00:48.669]  Two years since FEMA took over.
[01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:52.732]  You know, that's something I mentioned on a show this weekend but haven't mentioned here yet.
[01:00:52.772 --> 01:00:54.273]  It's in my film, Police State 3.
[01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.994]  And I say that because, folks, I mean, this is on record.
[01:00:57.515 --> 01:01:00.236]  New Orleans was federalized two and a half years ago.
[01:01:00.697 --> 01:01:04.319]  Every major agency was under FEMA's control two and a half years ago.
[01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:08.802]  Times-Picayune, the city was federalized, and no one even knows about this.
[01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:13.745]  Well, you have your figurehead mayor, the black mayor, that appeals to the population, but...
[01:01:14.201 --> 01:01:16.463]  He is not in control, and I think he is sincere.
[01:01:16.523 --> 01:01:18.004]  I mean, he wouldn't be speaking the way he was.
[01:01:18.064 --> 01:01:23.589]  Isn't it interesting that it's the only city they completely federalized, and then this magically happens there?
[01:01:23.609 --> 01:01:24.389]  Yeah.
[01:01:24.689 --> 01:01:28.573]  Well, and Charles is right, and we always need to remember these lessons we've learned from the past.
[01:01:28.673 --> 01:01:31.315]  This is an order out of chaos situation.
[01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.096]  This is problem, reaction, solution.
[01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:38.881]  Now, the globalists clearly, clearly are trying to make this as bad as possible, while grandstanding as saviors.
[01:01:39.392 --> 01:02:00.480]  I think the plan was to have it all break down and make the locals look stupid, but because the locals were trying to do something, the feds now have been caught holding back the aid and the good police from surrounding areas, and so now that they were trying to make it look bad, to then say, oh, the regular army got here, they're heroes, which they're now trying to do, but it's backfiring on them, Kevin.
[01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:03.067]  That's what this clip addresses here.
[01:02:03.127 --> 01:02:06.813]  But remember, they had this solution picked out well in advance.
[01:02:06.873 --> 01:02:15.506]  And the solution is to create chaos, to have some people that are black or voodoo, or they're different from us, that they can label and call them
[01:02:16.196 --> 01:02:19.757]  The whole thing fits perfectly into a larger scope.
[01:02:20.377 --> 01:02:22.758]  And clearly the globalists knew the city was going to be hit.
[01:02:22.798 --> 01:02:25.458]  They knew it was going to flood the next time it got hit by a big storm.
[01:02:25.818 --> 01:02:27.159]  They knew what was going to happen.
[01:02:27.219 --> 01:02:34.180]  And Bush's claim and Rice's claim and Chertoff's claim that they never heard or never knew.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.421]  It is a bold-faced lie.
[01:02:36.941 --> 01:02:41.322]  It was the number one priority for the Army Corps of Engineers.
[01:02:41.642 --> 01:02:43.243]  People resigned over it.
[01:02:43.563 --> 01:02:47.424]  They were told they'd be fired if they didn't go along with the ballgame.
[01:02:47.884 --> 01:02:52.065]  And then now the very people that caused this to happen are grandstanding as our saviors.
[01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:53.545]  Correct.
[01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:55.145]  Do you have time for me to play this clip?
[01:02:55.265 --> 01:02:56.246]  I'll tell you what.
[01:02:56.286 --> 01:02:58.126]  Let's just get Paul Craig Roberts on.
[01:02:58.506 --> 01:03:00.647]  We'll have him hold Kevin while you play this clip.
[01:03:01.507 --> 01:03:02.887]  And then we'll be right back.
[01:03:02.907 --> 01:03:03.727]  This is Kevin Smith.
[01:03:03.748 --> 01:03:05.668]  There's some camera work for us from time to time.
[01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:06.903]  Good friend of mine.
[01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:10.585]  We'll be right back, and we'll go to your calls early in this hour, folks.
[01:03:10.605 --> 01:03:13.747]  I'm not going to make Mike and Sean and Wes and Will hold that long.
[01:03:15.548 --> 01:03:22.612]  Paul Craig Roberts is a real gentleman, former deputy there at the Department of the Treasury.
[01:03:23.892 --> 01:03:26.574]  He was the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.
[01:03:27.254 --> 01:03:32.377]  And he's coming on to talk about his article, Impeach Bush Now Before More Die!
[01:03:33.556 --> 01:03:35.317]  And it's on prisonplanet.com right now.
[01:03:35.337 --> 01:03:38.838]  We'll be talking to Paul Kurt Roberts after Kevin finishes up and plays this clip.
[01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:41.220]  And then we'll take more of your calls as well.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.821]  Again, it's a daunting task, but I'm going to cover all this news.
[01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:49.843]  There are so many facets to this unfolding nightmare that could bring down our economy.
[01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:57.782]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.022 --> 01:03:59.603]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.943 --> 01:04:04.605]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.965 --> 01:04:09.387]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.807 --> 01:04:13.969]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.889 --> 01:04:16.711]  Call toll free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:54.048 --> 01:04:54.769]  Hello, folks.
[01:04:54.789 --> 01:05:01.635]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:09.001]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:20.651]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:05:20.971 --> 01:05:21.772]  We're good to go.
[01:05:50.811 --> 01:05:50.851]  808-803-4438
[01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:57.447]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.027]  Why?
[01:05:58.047 --> 01:06:00.989]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:06.012]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:06:06.152 --> 01:06:15.858]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:23.422]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping, a 30% savings off the regular price.
[01:06:23.622 --> 01:06:25.003]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:28.105]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:06:55.070 --> 01:07:01.094]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.695 --> 01:07:04.737]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.118 --> 01:07:16.646]  All we've heard about is martial law and how good it is and how wonderful it is to give up our freedoms, to set aside our Constitution for a military form of government.
[01:07:17.026 --> 01:07:18.627]  Bush has set up NORTHCOM.
[01:07:18.647 --> 01:07:23.851]  I mean, in the last couple months, from Virginia to California, we've got the local newscasts.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:32.127]  Where the military openly trains to confiscate our guns, and the police train with the military, and they call us the rebels?
[01:07:33.088 --> 01:07:36.932]  Oh, you know, we're going out and confiscating the firearms of the rebels.
[01:07:37.612 --> 01:07:39.194]  And they admit it's for here in America.
[01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:46.460]  So they gear all of this up, build this huge structure, and then don't fix the levees.
[01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:50.024]  And then the one area that was having construction done on it...
[01:07:51.005 --> 01:07:53.867]  It is coming out in reports that people did report explosions.
[01:07:54.507 --> 01:07:56.269]  I don't want to believe this again, folks.
[01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:59.771]  But if they... People say, well, it makes Bush look bad.
[01:07:59.851 --> 01:08:03.954]  I mean, most people... And I was just talking to Paul Craig Roberts during the break.
[01:08:04.494 --> 01:08:07.596]  Most people I talk to, even people that have disagreed with me in the past...
[01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.066]  We're good to go.
[01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:10.606]  We're good to go.
[01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:31.050]  At least it sounds like more radical than I am.
[01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:33.931]  Because it's so obvious, folks.
[01:08:34.311 --> 01:08:40.633]  Regardless, they held back rescue workers and firemen and police that wanted to go in and save people.
[01:08:40.993 --> 01:08:46.856]  For days and days and days, FEMA just moves in and sits down on their big hind ends and does nothing.
[01:08:47.396 --> 01:08:49.256]  Ordered out of chaos is what they're doing.
[01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:53.398]  And we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts for the rest of this hour and taking some of your calls.
[01:08:54.585 --> 01:08:56.867]  Impeach Bush now before more die.
[01:08:56.888 --> 01:08:58.169]  Here's his column.
[01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:59.770]  We have it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:59.811 --> 01:09:02.513]  It's also available at LewRockwell.com and other areas.
[01:09:03.414 --> 01:09:05.957]  And it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:05.977 --> 01:09:12.744]  So we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts, who was the number two in the Treasury Department, Deputy Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan.
[01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:15.678]  He's been very outspoken about Bush.
[01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:17.199]  I mean, Bush is not a conservative.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:18.600]  He's not even a liberal.
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:23.625]  He is a fascistic control freak, puppet of very corrupt corporate interests.
[01:09:23.645 --> 01:09:27.969]  But again, real fast, Kevin Smith, you got this clip you want to play for Meet the Press.
[01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.351]  Play it real fast.
[01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:30.532]  First, set it up for us.
[01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:34.716]  Okay, this is, again, this is the Jefferson Parish president.
[01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:39.260]  His name is Aaron Burchard, and his interview followed Comrade Chertoff.
[01:09:40.012 --> 01:09:42.533]  And initially in his interview, he had a list.
[01:09:42.573 --> 01:09:43.874]  He kept looking down and reading it.
[01:09:44.274 --> 01:09:45.214]  FEMA needs more money.
[01:09:45.274 --> 01:09:46.615]  FEMA needs more control.
[01:09:46.695 --> 01:09:49.836]  And then he broke from the script and got very emotional.
[01:09:49.896 --> 01:09:54.918]  And basically his headline quote is, we've been abandoned by our own country in tears.
[01:09:54.998 --> 01:09:56.218]  But here's the clip for you, Alex.
[01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.479]  Listen to what he says FEMA did.
[01:09:57.679 --> 01:09:58.099]  Go ahead.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.180]  Almost a week out.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.041]  Let me give you just three quick examples.
[01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:06.302]  We had Walmart deliver three trucks of water.
[01:10:06.758 --> 01:10:07.759]  Trailer trucks to water.
[01:10:07.779 --> 01:10:09.040]  FEMA turned them back.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.501]  They said we didn't need them.
[01:10:10.801 --> 01:10:11.802]  This was a week ago.
[01:10:12.703 --> 01:10:19.408]  FEMA, we had 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish.
[01:10:19.608 --> 01:10:21.890]  The Coast Guard said, come get the fuel right away.
[01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:24.432]  When we got there with our trucks, they got a word.
[01:10:24.552 --> 01:10:26.293]  FEMA says, don't give you the fuel.
[01:10:26.693 --> 01:10:32.258]  Yesterday, yesterday, FEMA comes in and cuts all of our emergency communication lines.
[01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:33.939]  They cut them without notice.
[01:10:34.622 --> 01:10:36.483]  Our sheriff, Harry Lee, goes back in.
[01:10:36.503 --> 01:10:37.864]  He reconnects the line.
[01:10:37.884 --> 01:10:42.166]  He posts armed guards on our line and says no one's getting near these lines.
[01:10:42.486 --> 01:10:50.850]  Sheriff Harry Lee said that if America, if American government would have responded like Walmart has responded, we wouldn't be in this crisis.
[01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:55.032]  But I want to thank Governor Blanco for all she's done and all her leadership.
[01:10:55.052 --> 01:10:56.393]  She's sitting in the National Guard.
[01:10:56.773 --> 01:11:02.415]  I just repaired a breach on my side of the 17th Street Canal that the Secretary didn't foresee.
[01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:03.796]  A 300-foot breach.
[01:11:04.136 --> 01:11:10.498]  I just completed it yesterday with convoys of National Guard and local parish workers and levy board people.
[01:11:10.798 --> 01:11:13.359]  It took us two and a half days working 24-7.
[01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:14.840]  I just closed it.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:22.462]  I'm telling you, most importantly, I want to thank my public employees that have worked 24-7, that burn out, the doctors, the nurses.
[01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:26.404]  And I want to give you one last story, and I'll shut up and let you tell me whatever you want to tell me.
[01:11:27.062 --> 01:11:32.024]  The guy who runs this building I'm in, emergency management, he's responsible for everything.
[01:11:32.524 --> 01:11:34.605]  His mother was trapped in the St.
[01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:35.645]  Bernard nursing home.
[01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:39.907]  And every day she called him and said, is it coming son?
[01:11:40.267 --> 01:11:41.307]  Is somebody coming?
[01:11:41.767 --> 01:11:44.808]  And he said, yeah mama, somebody's coming to get you.
[01:11:45.428 --> 01:11:47.569]  Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday.
[01:11:47.889 --> 01:11:49.610]  Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday.
[01:11:51.455 --> 01:11:55.298]  Kevin?
[01:11:55.358 --> 01:11:58.861]  Kevin?
[01:12:01.002 --> 01:12:06.126]  All right, put him on hold.
[01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:11.791]  I don't want Paul Kurt Roberts to have to hold much longer, but I've taped dozens of such clips myself.
[01:12:12.231 --> 01:12:14.192]  Kevin, be sure to bring that to the TV show tomorrow night.
[01:12:14.212 --> 01:12:14.913]  We're going to play that.
[01:12:16.054 --> 01:12:18.896]  Folks, for those that don't understand, did you hear that FEMA cut
[01:12:19.477 --> 01:12:20.598]  The emergency lines.
[01:12:20.638 --> 01:12:24.180]  They don't want anyone else having any control or helping anyone.
[01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.802]  FEMA said no to the Coast Guard's fuel.
[01:12:27.403 --> 01:12:29.264]  This is the city council president.
[01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:32.466]  This is the equivalent of the mayor of that town.
[01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:35.909]  It's about control.
[01:12:35.989 --> 01:12:41.613]  It's about making it bad to make everybody look bad so then they can fix everything and go, look, we saved you.
[01:12:42.253 --> 01:12:47.417]  Folks, I have congressional hearings from the 80s when it came out that FEMA's built concentration camps.
[01:12:48.508 --> 01:12:49.328]  Kevin, are you there now?
[01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:50.189]  Yeah, I'm in here.
[01:12:50.309 --> 01:12:54.070]  You've got to finish real quick, because we have the Deputy Secretary holding for now 10 minutes.
[01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.691]  Or not 10 minutes, about 6-7 minutes.
[01:12:56.031 --> 01:13:03.353]  But, I mean, that is incredibly powerful, hidden in plain view, FEMA caught red-handed.
[01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:06.194]  And, folks, I've got hundreds of such tax reports.
[01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:07.535]  I've taped it off TV.
[01:13:08.567 --> 01:13:09.288]  Many, many times.
[01:13:09.788 --> 01:13:13.992]  Everybody cutting the lines, refusing the water.
[01:13:14.412 --> 01:13:17.395]  They want a breakdown so they can call in the troops.
[01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:18.335]  We know this.
[01:13:18.836 --> 01:13:22.479]  I don't know who broke those levees or why Bush didn't fix them, but I know this.
[01:13:22.839 --> 01:13:25.882]  Those pieces of filth have done a thousand drills.
[01:13:26.962 --> 01:13:27.403]  Literally.
[01:13:27.843 --> 01:13:31.086]  They know what happens after three days without food and water.
[01:13:32.305 --> 01:13:33.446]  And they knew.
[01:13:34.066 --> 01:13:37.527]  They knew this would break down, and they didn't do a thing.
[01:13:37.607 --> 01:13:43.890]  And now, I got the Army Times saying, combat operations, dealing with insurgents, dealing with terrorists.
[01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:46.652]  And now, everybody's having their guns confiscated.
[01:13:46.692 --> 01:13:48.893]  They won't let you buy guns around Mowen, Louisiana.
[01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:51.394]  Kevin, will you bring that to the TV show tomorrow night?
[01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:54.855]  I tell you what, can I give out the website that I've got these video clips from?
[01:13:55.075 --> 01:13:55.756]  Yeah, give it to us.
[01:13:56.136 --> 01:14:00.558]  It's called crooksandliars.com crooksandliars.com
[01:14:01.497 --> 01:14:02.598]  And one real quick thing.
[01:14:02.858 --> 01:14:05.841]  Remember when they fired General Garner from Iraq?
[01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:07.402]  There is no more quick thing.
[01:14:07.422 --> 01:14:08.262]  I've got to go, Kevin.
[01:14:09.143 --> 01:14:09.704]  I'll see you, buddy.
[01:14:09.924 --> 01:14:10.885]  That's a great website.
[01:14:10.925 --> 01:14:15.428]  In fact, email Paul Watson right now and tell him to get that video clip up immediately.
[01:14:15.888 --> 01:14:17.910]  Kevin, you can call in later after Craig Roberts is gone.
[01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:20.172]  I just can't have him hold for this entire segment.
[01:14:21.213 --> 01:14:24.455]  Craig Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:14:25.596 --> 01:14:26.076]  Thank you.
[01:14:26.677 --> 01:14:28.218]  What did you think of that clip?
[01:14:28.979 --> 01:14:30.420]  Well, I'd already read it.
[01:14:31.224 --> 01:14:35.769]  It's been sent to me scores of times, maybe even hundreds.
[01:14:39.372 --> 01:14:50.604]  When I wrote my first piece on New Orleans a couple of days ago, I said this was an example of the incompetence of the Bush administration.
[01:14:52.845 --> 01:14:57.326]  It dawned on me that it was worse than that and right after that I wrote the second piece.
[01:14:57.366 --> 01:15:01.828]  I think the one you've got now which is I said that this is criminal negligence.
[01:15:02.788 --> 01:15:04.328]  It goes beyond incompetence.
[01:15:05.108 --> 01:15:14.651]  Criminal negligence if some private party had behaved in this way they would be facing serious legal problems.
[01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:21.513]  And I thought that that would bring me in a lot of criticism from the patriotic Americans waving the flags and
[01:15:22.837 --> 01:15:30.398]  And it's true, a few Bush supporters sent me emails saying that they were following the Karl Rove line.
[01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:32.859]  It's all the fault of the state and local authorities.
[01:15:34.259 --> 01:15:34.979]  Of course it isn't.
[01:15:36.139 --> 01:15:47.661]  But I was surprised by the amount of emails I got which said that, well, you know, you're right, it is incompetence, it is criminal negligence, but it's far worse than you know.
[01:15:48.901 --> 01:15:50.442]  And, for example, here's one.
[01:15:50.962 --> 01:15:51.822]  This person says,
[01:15:52.924 --> 01:16:05.628]  I'm still wondering if the powers that be engineered the blacks on the rampage picture by intentionally holding back and letting them go wild.
[01:16:05.788 --> 01:16:11.650]  Could it be to start a new precedent of turning the army on citizens or subjects?
[01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.511]  And that's of course what's happened.
[01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:19.613]  We have now not just the National Guard there, we have U.S.
[01:16:19.693 --> 01:16:20.633]  military troops.
[01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:26.914]  Which is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.
[01:16:28.735 --> 01:16:33.439]  And so there is now a new president.
[01:16:33.579 --> 01:16:48.090]  And it looks like the story that the Bush administration is spinning, you know, is that this is federal authority saving the city from looters.
[01:16:49.966 --> 01:16:52.648]  Yeah, I wondered why the media said, oh, look at the horrible job.
[01:16:52.688 --> 01:16:55.610]  And, oh, the federal troops, they should run our lives.
[01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:56.931]  This is a setup.
[01:16:56.991 --> 01:17:03.935]  We can conclusively prove they knowingly blocked food and water when our own military, our own police wanted to bring it in.
[01:17:04.215 --> 01:17:07.717]  We've caught them red-handed, Mr. Secretary.
[01:17:07.737 --> 01:17:09.098]  I mean, what do you say to this?
[01:17:09.899 --> 01:17:12.020]  Well, you know, I'm a very open-minded person.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.001]  I'm very deliberative.
[01:17:13.501 --> 01:17:19.245]  And I'm stunned by every new thought that I have on this.
[01:17:20.938 --> 01:17:28.460]  It does seem to me that they're guilty in a huge variety of ways.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:35.781]  For example, they stopped the funding for the hurricane protection projects in 2003.
[01:17:37.562 --> 01:17:46.424]  Despite all sorts of dire warnings and predictions from within the government itself, and despite
[01:17:48.182 --> 01:17:55.105]  A fierce protest from New Orleans, a series of articles in the major newspaper there.
[01:17:56.866 --> 01:18:05.849]  Congress was actually disturbed and was going to restore all the funding in the 2006 budget, but of course now it's too late.
[01:18:05.869 --> 01:18:06.650]  The city's lost.
[01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:09.851]  So why deliberately?
[01:18:11.778 --> 01:18:22.066]  Take away funding from projects that every expert in the country knew were vital to protecting New Orleans, even from a Level 2 hurricane.
[01:18:22.466 --> 01:18:27.570]  Well, in fact, they said that it was the number one threat statistically that would happen.
[01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:28.250]  That's right.
[01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:31.453]  And the third largest disaster we could possibly face.
[01:18:32.193 --> 01:18:34.915]  It was recognized as the number one threat.
[01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:40.960]  Probably the largest disaster, actually, because New Orleans... In fact, I would say that this is...
[01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:42.672]  The largest disaster.
[01:18:42.692 --> 01:18:43.734]  They're our biggest port.
[01:18:43.754 --> 01:18:46.399]  We have 25% of our energy coming out of there.
[01:18:46.599 --> 01:18:47.321]  Stay there, sir.
[01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:51.308]  Paul Craig Roberts, former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.
[01:18:55.174 --> 01:18:57.616]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[01:18:57.857 --> 01:19:00.659]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.004]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[01:19:05.264 --> 01:19:14.533]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, this small, beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:19.755]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:19:20.036 --> 01:19:31.541]  Loaded with Zanzones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[01:19:32.221 --> 01:19:38.263]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[01:20:49.847 --> 01:20:59.674]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:00.114 --> 01:21:07.900]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:16.086]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:16.366 --> 01:21:18.326]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:21:54.218 --> 01:21:59.539]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.121]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:08.562]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:23:01.983 --> 01:23:06.827]  We'll be opening the phones up here in the next segment for you if you want to talk to Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:23:07.828 --> 01:23:15.795]  And he was Assistant Secretary to the Treasury for Economic Policy, which was actually the person setting economic policy.
[01:23:16.545 --> 01:23:21.387]  And under that, he had the emergency management job and had deputies.
[01:23:22.027 --> 01:23:28.069]  And as I was just talking to him during the break, he also did a lot of wargaming and being sent to these underground bunkers.
[01:23:28.129 --> 01:23:31.950]  And I said, were you ever sent to Site R, where Cheney basically lives?
[01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:40.053]  And he said, well, they tried to send me there to keep me from implementing Reagan's tax cuts.
[01:23:40.113 --> 01:23:43.134]  So Paul Craig Roberts has a lot of training in this.
[01:23:44.318 --> 01:23:49.484]  He's got great conservative credentials, which Bush does not have, unfortunately.
[01:23:49.725 --> 01:24:04.242]  And Paul continuing, so we were talking during the break, and I was saying that I feel like I'm behind the curve a little bit, because I don't want to believe they did this on purpose, but when we get hundreds of reports of them blocking water, blocking food, blocking police...
[01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:05.483]  We're good to go.
[01:24:05.543 --> 01:24:05.803]  I think?
[01:24:35.106 --> 01:24:40.168]  So they could then act like having a military dictatorship is the solution.
[01:24:40.528 --> 01:24:43.229]  Paul Craig Roberts, please continue.
[01:24:44.169 --> 01:24:57.533]  Well, you know, while you were talking, I was just looking at a new email that came in, and this person is insisting that the shooting that was going on, that this was actually part of the plot, too.
[01:24:58.602 --> 01:25:00.644]  It was to build more excuses.
[01:25:01.564 --> 01:25:03.046]  Who knows what the truth is?
[01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:06.368]  It would be very difficult for us to find out.
[01:25:06.809 --> 01:25:07.909]  I'm not sure.
[01:25:07.929 --> 01:25:10.952]  But if it is a plot, don't you think it's backfiring to a certain degree?
[01:25:11.852 --> 01:25:20.099]  No, because people will be so glad to be rescued and the mayor will be so glad that
[01:25:21.439 --> 01:25:28.420]  Finally, help came because it looked like he was going to preside over tens of thousands of people going to their doom.
[01:25:28.741 --> 01:25:32.621]  So if Bush is a lame duck, he'll take a little bit of blame, but it won't matter.
[01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:37.022]  But the military-industrial complex gets its awful precedent set.
[01:25:37.702 --> 01:25:44.583]  Well, the power of the federal government is now greater for all time.
[01:25:44.724 --> 01:25:45.364]  It'll never go back.
[01:25:48.001 --> 01:26:06.827]  The Posse Comitatus Act, you see, it's been eroding ever since it was passed in 1878, but it makes it a felony to use regular Army troops or Air Force or Navy troops for maintaining order.
[01:26:07.307 --> 01:26:17.690]  Our form of government separates the military and police functions, and that's why the National Guard or state organizations subject to the governor so that it keeps
[01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:22.730]  In compliance with the Positive Chymotitis Act.
[01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:23.813]  It's also the reason that
[01:26:24.577 --> 01:26:33.885]  The Navy ships that are used today in the war against drugs have on board Coast Guard people who actually interdict the suspected drug shipments.
[01:26:33.966 --> 01:26:36.528]  It's not done by official Navy people.
[01:26:36.548 --> 01:26:42.373]  Because we... I mean, the Founding Fathers... I mean, it even goes back to the Founding Fathers saying don't quarter troops.
[01:26:42.393 --> 01:26:45.396]  I mean, it goes back to Caesar crossing the Rubicon.
[01:26:45.676 --> 01:26:49.980]  It's a telltale sign of having a domestic military that you're in a dictatorship.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:50.921]  Well, in our...
[01:26:51.870 --> 01:27:06.962]  In our country it goes back to the hearts of Reconstruction in the South where the Yankee or the Northern troops used the police powers they had to rape women, to rob citizens, to dispossess people.
[01:27:08.572 --> 01:27:15.876]  That now brings me to the confirmed video of police not just getting food and water, they're robbing all sorts of goodies.
[01:27:16.016 --> 01:27:18.717]  Jewelry, tennis shoes, clothes.
[01:27:19.237 --> 01:27:21.939]  They're actually leading the looters in many cases.
[01:27:23.039 --> 01:27:34.825]  Well, I think if you look at the extent of this disaster and the lack of any excuse, there's no excuse
[01:27:35.563 --> 01:27:43.904]  Before this, we had never in our history had the federal government take a week to respond to a disaster.
[01:27:44.044 --> 01:27:46.485]  Don't you remember the hurricanes last year in Florida?
[01:27:47.185 --> 01:27:47.665]  Instant.
[01:27:47.765 --> 01:27:49.045]  The help was there instantly.
[01:27:51.426 --> 01:27:53.846]  They were nothing like this disaster.
[01:27:54.226 --> 01:27:59.067]  In fact, this is the first time ever that all the help wasn't mobilized in advance.
[01:27:59.747 --> 01:28:01.847]  They knew the hurricane was going to New Orleans.
[01:28:01.887 --> 01:28:04.988]  In fact, it looked like it was going to be a level five and make a direct hit.
[01:28:05.999 --> 01:28:10.402]  And the proper procedure is that everything is already mobilized and ready to go.
[01:28:11.623 --> 01:28:12.283]  But it's not.
[01:28:12.303 --> 01:28:13.684]  This has never happened before.
[01:28:13.744 --> 01:28:18.167]  This is totally unprecedented.
[01:28:18.307 --> 01:28:20.289]  Well, Paul, it has happened before.
[01:28:20.769 --> 01:28:25.332]  On 9-11, the standard operating procedure was ignored.
[01:28:26.012 --> 01:28:29.455]  The default mode was ignored.
[01:28:30.135 --> 01:28:31.916]  So I guess it has happened before.
[01:28:32.777 --> 01:28:34.158]  But this is the second time.
[01:28:34.693 --> 01:28:42.096]  We'll be right back with Paul Craig Roberts on the other side of this quick break, and we'll continue, then we'll take some of your calls.
[01:28:42.176 --> 01:28:43.316]  More on Posse Comentatus.
[01:28:43.976 --> 01:28:44.877]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.357 --> 01:28:46.978]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.878 --> 01:28:50.559]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.193 --> 01:29:00.699]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:04.902]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:29:05.202 --> 01:29:07.364]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:29:07.704 --> 01:29:14.750]  All-natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:29:15.071 --> 01:29:17.673]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:29:17.933 --> 01:29:21.416]  My toenails now look clear, and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:29:21.696 --> 01:29:29.603]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:29:29.984 --> 01:29:31.485]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:29:31.745 --> 01:29:37.551]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:43.679]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:46.463]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[01:29:46.843 --> 01:29:48.085]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:29:48.325 --> 01:29:52.231]  For clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:29:53.797 --> 01:29:55.778]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:55.858 --> 01:30:06.561]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.941 --> 01:30:11.462]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.542 --> 01:30:22.866]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.466 --> 01:30:30.312]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.712 --> 01:30:32.854]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.334 --> 01:30:38.318]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.618 --> 01:30:49.167]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.407 --> 01:30:50.227]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:56.473 --> 01:31:03.339]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:03.579 --> 01:31:05.941]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:06.201 --> 01:31:08.143]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:08.503 --> 01:31:13.848]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:14.228 --> 01:31:18.513]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:18.953 --> 01:31:26.861]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:27.041 --> 01:31:32.087]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[01:31:32.127 --> 01:31:34.189]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:37.770]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.491]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:31:40.691 --> 01:31:43.251]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:31:43.291 --> 01:31:47.052]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:49.613]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:31:49.733 --> 01:31:50.233]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:32:00.405 --> 01:32:06.429]  Just a note, if he's listening, Kevin Smith, we went to that site and could not find that video clip.
[01:32:06.829 --> 01:32:07.550]  It's a dead link.
[01:32:08.479 --> 01:32:16.664]  If you could call back into the network and give the folks another alternative address for that video link, we'd appreciate it.
[01:32:17.145 --> 01:32:22.328]  Or if you'd email that video link to tips at infowars.com, that'd be great.
[01:32:22.448 --> 01:32:34.756]  In fact, folks, send us everything you want posted or you think is important, and we're going to continue on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com to try to get it all up there for you just to show what's happening here.
[01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:35.136]  But again...
[01:32:35.814 --> 01:32:36.415]  D.C.
[01:32:36.515 --> 01:32:38.236]  knew that this was the main threat.
[01:32:38.296 --> 01:32:45.041]  They knew that as soon as any strong hurricane with a lot of water hit New Orleans, that city was going to be gone.
[01:32:46.081 --> 01:32:49.524]  FEMA report last year was in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:32:49.584 --> 01:32:52.226]  Half a million could die was the headline.
[01:32:52.246 --> 01:32:53.747]  The city would become Atlantis.
[01:32:55.388 --> 01:32:57.750]  Well, it wasn't that bad, but it was nearly that bad.
[01:32:58.733 --> 01:33:06.283]  And they have just, the government openly has blocked food and water, openly has not let people get in there.
[01:33:06.303 --> 01:33:09.426]  And, you know, obviously I've made three films about the police state.
[01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:14.633]  Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:33:15.299 --> 01:33:23.766]  I've been to the urban warfare training drills in 1999 in Oakland, California, where the Marines openly trained to confiscate our guns and put us in camps.
[01:33:23.826 --> 01:33:25.567]  I mean, I got video of them admitting it.
[01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:36.276]  And then the last month I played news clips where now they openly, in Virginia, have drills arresting citizens, working with the police where they call us rebels.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.801]  And, oh, we've got to take everybody's guns.
[01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:40.542]  That causes rioting and looting.
[01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:41.643]  No, it doesn't.
[01:33:41.943 --> 01:33:47.205]  It actually keeps some law and order when there would be none because the police all basically quit.
[01:33:48.586 --> 01:33:51.548]  And, obviously, Posse Comitatus came after Reconstruction and...
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:34:07.487]  Because of what happened with the northern troops running around murdering and killing, even burning down a hotel my family had in Teague, Texas, and some of the tombstones actually list killed by northern soldiers during Reconstruction.
[01:34:08.748 --> 01:34:13.650]  But the founding fathers even spoke out against the horrors of a quartered army and the tyranny of it.
[01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:18.713]  That's one of the things that backfired on the British was the abuse of nature of their forces.
[01:34:19.776 --> 01:34:36.084]  Up until Trenton, they'd had almost every victory, and then after Trenton, they still had most of the victories, but the abuses that winter of 1776-1777 just made so many people angry that it backfired on them.
[01:34:36.384 --> 01:34:49.351]  We're talking to Paul Craig Roberts, who we're so honored to have with us today, and of course, he was the Assistant Secretary for the Treasury and Economic Policy, a very, very senior post, of course, in the Reagan administration.
[01:34:50.126 --> 01:34:53.269]  And he's got an article in Peach Bush now before more die.
[01:34:53.969 --> 01:35:02.295]  And obviously a very criminal, cold, calculating group of sociopathic predators.
[01:35:02.616 --> 01:35:03.456]  We know this.
[01:35:04.137 --> 01:35:12.243]  Held back the food, cut the police lines, cut their communication lines, didn't let them get...
[01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:17.671]  You know, messages basically in or out to accentuate the crisis.
[01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:19.311]  The jury is now in on that.
[01:35:19.351 --> 01:35:22.452]  I mean, we just played a mayor talking about it a few minutes ago.
[01:35:23.592 --> 01:35:30.634]  And we know because they wanted to be the saviors, the king daddies, to sell us on this in the posse commentatus.
[01:35:32.294 --> 01:35:41.876]  We had Tommy Franks last year and Cigar Aficionado, the outgoing head of CENTCOM, saying one more terrorist attack, we set aside the Constitution for a military, government, or martial law.
[01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:46.272]  We have Northcom, Eberhardt, openly talking about this.
[01:35:47.633 --> 01:36:08.980]  Paul Craig Roberts, I mean, we've heard, we've had so many preparations for martial law and government-sponsored TV miniseries and nightline specials for bio-attacks in West Nile or for swine flu or bird flu or SARS or terrorist attacks and
[01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:19.017]  On and on and on, but now we've got our reason to have troops running our lives, calling us insurgency in the Army times.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:24.101]  Please elaborate on your thoughts on this.
[01:36:25.022 --> 01:36:37.272]  Well, you see, what's happened to Americans is they've been brainwashed, and they no longer remember what the Founding Fathers taught us and said over and over and over.
[01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:38.773]  The Founding Fathers said,
[01:36:39.676 --> 01:36:42.618]  Your worst enemy is always your own government.
[01:36:43.659 --> 01:36:47.241]  Never confuse country with government.
[01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:52.886]  And never confuse patriotism with support for a government.
[01:36:53.346 --> 01:37:00.631]  But that's what all Americans do, especially the conservative ones, and especially the ones who listen to right-wing talk radio.
[01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:05.975]  They think that what patriotism means is falling in line with the government.
[01:37:06.917 --> 01:37:18.519]  So essentially, you have out there a mentality that's the same as the brown shirts who blindly follow Hitler because they think that's what they're supposed to be, where the allegiance lies.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:22.120]  The founding fathers said, no, don't trust the government.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:24.341]  Never trust your own government.
[01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:29.222]  It's always your worst enemy because it has the most power over you.
[01:37:29.602 --> 01:37:32.642]  All experience shows that the government is deadly dangerous.
[01:37:33.203 --> 01:37:34.823]  It's deadly dangerous and...
[01:37:35.718 --> 01:37:49.474]  And as they recognized when they passed the Posse Comitatus Act you cannot let the military take over the police functions because then that destroys the whole concept of a civilian state.
[01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:53.319]  Well, I mean, Paul, before this, obviously until the 17th Amendment
[01:37:54.062 --> 01:37:57.463]  The states appointed the senators, so we controlled the Congress.
[01:37:57.843 --> 01:37:58.703]  Now that's gone.
[01:37:59.743 --> 01:38:05.444]  Then we had the Federal Reserve Act, of course, the same year, giving private banks control.
[01:38:06.064 --> 01:38:08.064]  Just thing after thing.
[01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:17.366]  The main thing, Alex, is that the federal government controls the other governments through the money, because they have the main taxing power and the main revenues.
[01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:23.307]  And so everyone else is dependent on the feds, and that's their main
[01:38:23.965 --> 01:38:25.111]  A method of controlling.
[01:38:25.131 --> 01:38:25.854]  Control the money.
[01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:28.555]  So where does it go from here?
[01:38:28.575 --> 01:38:30.376]  I mean, what should happen to Bush and his cronies?
[01:38:30.396 --> 01:38:31.417]  Because I've got to say this, sir.
[01:38:32.037 --> 01:38:39.462]  Under Bill Clinton, I saw the exact same preparations, but secretly, now they're merging police departments with the Army.
[01:38:39.862 --> 01:38:42.984]  Oh, the Army's giving you a building, but you've got to merge with them.
[01:38:43.344 --> 01:38:46.486]  They've got secret military units creeping around for decades.
[01:38:46.806 --> 01:38:48.287]  I mean, they've really been gearing up.
[01:38:48.487 --> 01:38:50.748]  What are they gearing up for, sir?
[01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:53.990]  What should happen to Bush, and where do you see all this going?
[01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:56.572]  Well, you know, I don't have that...
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:57.641]  Information.
[01:38:57.721 --> 01:39:00.523]  That's nothing they ever told me when I was assistant secretary.
[01:39:01.744 --> 01:39:03.185]  I do agree with you, Alex.
[01:39:03.245 --> 01:39:20.479]  It does look like that there's a push coming from inside the bowels of the police authorities that seems to be independent of whoever the president is or whatever party is in office because the same thing happens.
[01:39:20.799 --> 01:39:22.741]  It just gets worse.
[01:39:23.381 --> 01:39:25.543]  It's hard to say that it's
[01:39:25.939 --> 01:39:27.140]  That it's Bush doing it.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.920]  He might not even know what's going on.
[01:39:29.841 --> 01:39:31.922]  I'm not trying to make any apologies for him.
[01:39:32.042 --> 01:39:39.626]  I think his government, I think it's enough for us to say that New Orleans demonstrated massive federal incompetence.
[01:39:40.486 --> 01:39:45.849]  That if it could be laid on private people, they would be guilty of criminal negligence.
[01:39:46.489 --> 01:39:52.312]  And therefore, I think some kind of accountability has to be exercised
[01:39:53.626 --> 01:40:06.057]  But that's what's so scary, is that Bush is just a puppet, and literally the private military industrial complex said, hey, we got the weapons, we got the know-how, we got the war gamers, why shouldn't we just run America?
[01:40:06.437 --> 01:40:08.960]  The private corporate interests basically own and control that.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:09.740]  They're predatory.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.701]  They're not free market.
[01:40:11.101 --> 01:40:14.084]  They're turning America into an open third world police state.
[01:40:14.364 --> 01:40:15.785]  I mean, how do we stop these people?
[01:40:17.146 --> 01:40:18.848]  You're asking a very good question.
[01:40:20.049 --> 01:40:21.990]  It'll be harder and harder to stop.
[01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:26.433]  The longer it goes on and the more the people take it.
[01:40:26.473 --> 01:40:35.818]  But keep in mind that despite the fantastic military power of the United States, it can't occupy Baghdad or control the road to the airport.
[01:40:36.698 --> 01:40:40.821]  So it just depends on how much resistance and what kind of resistance they meet.
[01:40:40.861 --> 01:40:46.544]  But I think one thing we can certainly do is demand accountability for this failure.
[01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:48.725]  Do not buy the Karl Rove line.
[01:40:49.403 --> 01:40:52.328]  That this was a failure of state and local government.
[01:40:53.229 --> 01:40:54.010]  It's all false.
[01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:57.356]  No, this was the feds actually holding up the aid.
[01:40:57.596 --> 01:40:58.818]  We have them red-handed.
[01:40:58.978 --> 01:41:01.502]  But, Paul, I mean, I've got to speak.
[01:41:01.562 --> 01:41:03.065]  I mean, listen, you're talking...
[01:41:03.917 --> 01:41:06.558]  I mean, you're talking like that rebel.
[01:41:06.838 --> 01:41:18.123]  I mean, you're comparing America, you know, shades foreshadowing, more than foreshadowing, of us having to physically defend ourselves in an insurgent-type situation.
[01:41:18.143 --> 01:41:23.885]  You're saying, well, yes, they're trying to set up this police state dictatorship.
[01:41:23.905 --> 01:41:25.566]  In fact, I've got the Army Times.
[01:41:26.366 --> 01:41:27.667]  Alex, you don't even need that.
[01:41:27.707 --> 01:41:31.008]  All you have to do is look at the Patriot Act, where they take away...
[01:41:32.688 --> 01:41:38.510]  Habeas corpus, where they can now arrest you on their own initiative without charge, hold you indefinitely.
[01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:44.691]  It's a tremendous erosion of civil liberties.
[01:41:44.751 --> 01:41:51.513]  But I mean, you were describing almost going, America going into an Iraq situation.
[01:41:52.253 --> 01:41:59.035]  What I was pointing out is, I was just telling you, don't assign them omnipotence.
[01:41:59.898 --> 01:42:07.642]  Because despite their enormous military power, they can't occupy Baghdad or control the roads of the airport.
[01:42:07.662 --> 01:42:09.543]  Well, I don't think they're omnipotent.
[01:42:09.563 --> 01:42:10.724]  They're not omnipotent.
[01:42:10.744 --> 01:42:13.305]  So we don't have to say, oh my God, what can we do?
[01:42:13.365 --> 01:42:14.786]  We have to give up and die.
[01:42:14.806 --> 01:42:16.907]  I think that we can do things like you're doing.
[01:42:16.947 --> 01:42:17.887]  You're raising hell.
[01:42:17.947 --> 01:42:19.228]  You're trying to make people aware.
[01:42:19.288 --> 01:42:20.489]  You're trying to make them think.
[01:42:21.409 --> 01:42:24.871]  To tell you the honest guy truth, you know as well as I do, we don't really know what
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.261]  Why this is going on.
[01:42:27.301 --> 01:42:28.762]  We can see implications.
[01:42:29.322 --> 01:42:34.965]  We can see massive failures that have no logical or moral explanation.
[01:42:35.185 --> 01:42:40.708]  Why would FEMA cut the sheriff's communications lines because the sheriff was trying to get aid to people?
[01:42:42.481 --> 01:42:44.462]  That's a very good question.
[01:42:44.502 --> 01:42:45.863]  I don't know an answer.
[01:42:45.883 --> 01:42:50.466]  I mean, over and over again, we catch them frustrating, giving aid to people.
[01:42:50.486 --> 01:42:55.350]  You see, some libertarians would simply say, well, you know, they're just a big bureaucracy and they want to control.
[01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:56.871]  They don't want anybody else to control.
[01:42:57.692 --> 01:43:01.875]  But I think you're right about their power to decide.
[01:43:01.935 --> 01:43:03.776]  For example, if you...
[01:43:06.832 --> 01:43:08.393]  Can you give me just a minute?
[01:43:08.613 --> 01:43:11.556]  I can read you a statement from an email.
[01:43:12.256 --> 01:43:12.937]  Now, take your time.
[01:43:12.977 --> 01:43:13.497]  Take your time.
[01:43:13.537 --> 01:43:23.785]  This is an emergency management official who is responding to the argument that, well, it's all the state and local fault.
[01:43:24.405 --> 01:43:26.226]  Why didn't the governor and the mayor do it?
[01:43:26.306 --> 01:43:27.948]  And he says, it doesn't work that way.
[01:43:29.168 --> 01:43:31.890]  I worked for the Georgia Emergency Management for two years.
[01:43:31.951 --> 01:43:35.193]  It was clear the feds were involved in every single thing we did.
[01:43:35.894 --> 01:43:39.256]  If we had a response plan for something, it was sent up and approved by the feds.
[01:43:39.976 --> 01:43:43.138]  If you wanted to purchase something with grant funds, it was approved by the feds.
[01:43:43.999 --> 01:43:48.341]  We did a review of infrastructure in the state, including a buffer zone protection plan
[01:43:49.182 --> 01:43:53.004]  And it was all subject to the feds who had the final say.
[01:43:53.244 --> 01:43:54.685]  He says, I was part of the G8.
[01:43:55.045 --> 01:43:58.646]  Remember the G8 meeting on Sea Island where they brought in all the foreign ministers?
[01:43:58.846 --> 01:43:59.407]  In Georgia?
[01:43:59.547 --> 01:43:59.767]  Yeah.
[01:44:00.307 --> 01:44:03.628]  He said, we had a massive military buildup and police presence.
[01:44:03.668 --> 01:44:05.429]  We had emergency water and food.
[01:44:05.449 --> 01:44:06.790]  We had two command centers.
[01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:09.271]  We had four ways to communicate.
[01:44:09.927 --> 01:44:11.608]  It was overkill from word go.
[01:44:11.648 --> 01:44:15.790]  We had DEA, FBI, State Police, National Guard, dozens of other agencies.
[01:44:16.090 --> 01:44:19.492]  Yeah, FEMA sets the table, especially in New Orleans.
[01:44:19.792 --> 01:44:20.953]  They set the whole thing.
[01:44:21.253 --> 01:44:29.617]  Listen, did you know that I have the Times-Picayune 2 1⁄2 years ago where they reported that every major agency was federalized and was being run by FEMA?
[01:44:29.637 --> 01:44:30.318]  Were you aware of that?
[01:44:30.658 --> 01:44:32.479]  Yeah, and that's what this man is saying right now.
[01:44:32.579 --> 01:44:33.079]  Oh, I didn't know.
[01:44:33.419 --> 01:44:34.300]  See, that's what he's saying.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:34.860]  He's saying that...
[01:44:36.137 --> 01:44:37.858]  It had already been federalized.
[01:44:38.158 --> 01:44:48.025]  It's already federalized, and there's no way they can shift the blame to the state and locals because the state and locals can't do anything except what FEMA lets them do.
[01:44:48.926 --> 01:44:53.309]  And he goes on to say the response to the hurricane is a national disgrace.
[01:44:54.050 --> 01:45:00.955]  And it says that, for example, the government has a stockpile of medicines for situations like this.
[01:45:01.696 --> 01:45:05.917]  It's a strategic stockpile and it's supposed to be deployed within 12 hours.
[01:45:06.777 --> 01:45:08.978]  And he says it's never yet deployed.
[01:45:08.998 --> 01:45:10.878]  And he goes on and on.
[01:45:11.258 --> 01:45:18.039]  Just one failure of the operation plans not being enacted.
[01:45:18.179 --> 01:45:19.700]  One after the other after the other.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.760]  Now, you have to say how?
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:25.241]  I mean, you can understand they might screw up and not do this or not do that.
[01:45:25.281 --> 01:45:25.841]  But why is it?
[01:45:26.658 --> 01:45:30.059]  That nothing that was supposed to be done was done.
[01:45:30.479 --> 01:45:45.723]  And then, literally over 100 reports of firemen and police and even the Coast Guard trying to give aid and FEMA going, you're not giving anybody aid, we don't need water, while people are on TV bugging for water.
[01:45:46.263 --> 01:45:47.883]  Yeah.
[01:45:48.523 --> 01:45:53.525]  See, the whole problem is we don't know.
[01:45:53.825 --> 01:45:54.425]  We can only...
[01:45:55.046 --> 01:45:55.586]  Speculate.
[01:45:55.606 --> 01:45:56.527]  We know failure.
[01:45:56.827 --> 01:46:00.550]  So the issue that I think we have to make out of it is it's failure.
[01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:02.831]  Whatever it's called, it's failure.
[01:46:03.292 --> 01:46:04.352]  Massive failure.
[01:46:04.452 --> 01:46:05.813]  It's unacceptable failure.
[01:46:06.374 --> 01:46:08.235]  It's actually criminal negligence.
[01:46:08.515 --> 01:46:11.757]  And then if they try to blame it... And just stick to that.
[01:46:12.037 --> 01:46:19.062]  And then if they try to blame it on the state and county, we have irrefutable, bulletproof proof they federalized it and then did this.
[01:46:19.242 --> 01:46:20.423]  Right, right.
[01:46:20.663 --> 01:46:23.805]  This is a massive failure.
[01:46:24.838 --> 01:46:36.171]  It has cost the United States its largest and most strategic port, through which, it's my understanding, 25% of our oil and gasoline comes.
[01:46:36.432 --> 01:46:38.174]  And all the refineries there are out.
[01:46:38.334 --> 01:46:39.155]  The port's out.
[01:46:40.943 --> 01:46:42.564]  You can look at the price of gasoline.
[01:46:42.904 --> 01:46:44.724]  This is a tremendous impact.
[01:46:44.845 --> 01:46:45.805]  What do you think this is going to do?
[01:46:45.865 --> 01:46:47.405]  I mean, you're an economist.
[01:46:47.725 --> 01:46:51.827]  Some people are saying that this could send us into a massive recession.
[01:46:52.607 --> 01:46:58.449]  I think that the gasoline price will soak up everyone's discretionary income.
[01:46:59.029 --> 01:47:02.030]  They'll have to cut back on so many other things.
[01:47:02.050 --> 01:47:04.331]  So it'll be a major cooling effect on the economy.
[01:47:04.491 --> 01:47:06.031]  It should have that effect.
[01:47:06.171 --> 01:47:07.992]  I don't see how it could be avoided.
[01:47:10.475 --> 01:47:25.818]  But you see, to lose one of your most famous cities and your most important port for what seems to be almost intentional incompetence, it's very hard to understand.
[01:47:25.838 --> 01:47:36.180]  It's very hard to understand why the mayor has to be pleading and crying for three or four days before anyone ever says, oh, is there a problem down there?
[01:47:36.992 --> 01:47:40.815]  And it's easy for helicopters to deliver food.
[01:47:41.095 --> 01:47:44.397]  Everyone knew that it was going to be a problem before the hurricane ever got there.
[01:47:45.118 --> 01:47:46.279]  And this is what I would say.
[01:47:46.319 --> 01:47:47.380]  This is worse than 9-11.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.143]  Because, you see, 9-11 wasn't announced days ahead on TV.
[01:47:52.864 --> 01:47:57.887]  Everybody in the country didn't know that what was about to happen in 9-11 was about to happen.
[01:47:57.907 --> 01:48:02.711]  There weren't a jillion contingency plans that were supposed to be in effect that weren't.
[01:48:02.791 --> 01:48:03.171]  There weren't.
[01:48:04.075 --> 01:48:07.818]  Plans to protect it that were cut off and not funded for three years prior to that.
[01:48:08.239 --> 01:48:12.002]  So this is a far worse kind of failure.
[01:48:12.022 --> 01:48:17.246]  Do you think it's fair to say we've had a complete stand down of the government and intentional incompetence?
[01:48:18.107 --> 01:48:25.013]  The people in New Orleans, the officials there, have said this is a complete stand down of the federal government.
[01:48:25.653 --> 01:48:27.695]  And they were left there to fester.
[01:48:28.673 --> 01:48:32.995]  And then people go nuts and start running around.
[01:48:33.015 --> 01:48:34.815]  A few criminals get out of control.
[01:48:35.136 --> 01:48:37.096]  Meanwhile, police are busy robbing more than anybody.
[01:48:37.136 --> 01:48:38.537]  You see, that's what you have to note.
[01:48:39.077 --> 01:48:43.159]  Nothing happened until they had provoked the looting and the shooting.
[01:48:44.419 --> 01:48:46.660]  It's almost like they did nothing.
[01:48:47.347 --> 01:48:50.288]  And waited until they got that result.
[01:48:50.448 --> 01:48:53.249]  To then say, look at how out of control the population is.
[01:48:53.509 --> 01:48:56.629]  We've got to have limits on freedom and troops on every street corner.
[01:48:56.829 --> 01:48:58.850]  Like Secretary of Defense Cohen said in 97.
[01:49:00.911 --> 01:49:11.073]  As I said, I'm getting this increasingly from readers who are telling me, look, these are not crazy sites.
[01:49:11.133 --> 01:49:13.054]  A lot of this is on conservative sites.
[01:49:15.601 --> 01:49:22.645]  But it's increasingly saying you don't go far enough, and I thought that I'd gone very far and would be in all kinds of hot water now.
[01:49:22.985 --> 01:49:27.287]  But the readers are ahead of me, and I don't know.
[01:49:27.387 --> 01:49:28.788]  Well, you know, it seems like that.
[01:49:29.148 --> 01:49:35.912]  Paul, so many times I was the one way out, you know, hanging my hind end over, and then I would always, unfortunately, be proven right.
[01:49:36.232 --> 01:49:38.053]  Now people are ahead of me, Paul.
[01:49:38.713 --> 01:49:42.075]  Yeah, I think, or at least you see, we don't know.
[01:49:42.697 --> 01:49:44.038]  We don't know the truth.
[01:49:44.098 --> 01:49:47.280]  We just know it's a massive failure that is inexplicable.
[01:49:47.861 --> 01:49:50.362]  And we can't accept these kinds of failures.
[01:49:50.402 --> 01:49:51.763]  These failures are massive.
[01:49:51.863 --> 01:49:52.564]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.584 --> 01:49:53.104]  We've got a break.
[01:49:53.825 --> 01:49:58.148]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.348 --> 01:50:02.791]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.931 --> 01:50:07.294]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:08.695]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.476 --> 01:50:14.679]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.759 --> 01:50:21.683]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.823 --> 01:50:23.885]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.045 --> 01:50:25.186]  Homeland Security.
[01:50:25.366 --> 01:50:26.166]  Executive orders.
[01:50:26.346 --> 01:50:27.227]  Force vaccinations.
[01:50:27.447 --> 01:50:34.509]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.809 --> 01:50:40.171]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.691 --> 01:50:43.332]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:43.432 --> 01:50:44.092]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.112 --> 01:50:44.452]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.472 --> 01:50:45.733]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.673 --> 01:50:57.576]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.796 --> 01:51:03.240]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:13.887]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.047 --> 01:51:18.390]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:26.937]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.197 --> 01:51:33.562]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.682 --> 01:51:38.166]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.386 --> 01:51:42.589]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:42.970 --> 01:51:46.993]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium.
[01:51:47.073 --> 01:51:47.273]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:52:10.336 --> 01:52:10.997]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:35.513]  That's herbalhealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:58.562 --> 01:53:00.464]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.944 --> 01:53:03.767]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.088 --> 01:53:07.990]  You know, I apologize for not getting to your calls earlier.
[01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:20.201]  It's just, in the first hour, I said there's so many facets to this, so many failures, so many intentional blocking of aid, that I'm almost speechless.
[01:53:20.221 --> 01:53:22.143]  I mean, I'm like in an orgy of evidence here.
[01:53:23.757 --> 01:53:25.799]  I want to go to Kevin in Alabama, but...
[01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:49.108]  Kevin, just stay there.
[01:53:49.128 --> 01:53:49.949]  We'll get to you, too.
[01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:55.570]  But Paul Craig Roberts has decided to stay with us a couple segments into the next hour to take your call.
[01:53:55.630 --> 01:53:58.731]  So have your question or comment ready so I can move to the next person.
[01:53:59.252 --> 01:54:02.653]  And I'm going to try to stick a rag in my mouth to shut up.
[01:54:03.913 --> 01:54:07.234]  Again, I'm going 100 miles an hour here because it's just so much.
[01:54:07.914 --> 01:54:11.115]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Maryland.
[01:54:11.175 --> 01:54:12.156]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:54:12.196 --> 01:54:12.556]  Go ahead.
[01:54:13.467 --> 01:54:14.268]  Hey, guys.
[01:54:14.348 --> 01:54:15.590]  Great show, Alex, as always.
[01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:17.212]  Thank you for having a live show today.
[01:54:17.453 --> 01:54:17.793]  Thank you.
[01:54:18.154 --> 01:54:23.481]  Listen, the bill was yours last night, and he said straight up, I actually called him up last night, that...
[01:54:24.668 --> 01:54:27.151]  President Bush rescinded the Posse Comitatus.
[01:54:27.171 --> 01:54:28.372]  He's usually pretty reliable.
[01:54:28.672 --> 01:54:29.873]  No, no, that was on the news.
[01:54:29.953 --> 01:54:33.757]  Bush has said, he's been saying he wants to get rid of it, and now they've said, we're rescinding it.
[01:54:33.977 --> 01:54:37.300]  He didn't have to rescind it for an emergency like this.
[01:54:38.241 --> 01:54:44.827]  Let's get a comment from somebody who really knows, because he worked in the federal government at the highest levels of the Treasury Department.
[01:54:45.268 --> 01:54:47.570]  Paul Craig Roberts' comments on what he just said.
[01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:51.372]  Well, I don't think Bush has the power to rescind it.
[01:54:51.632 --> 01:54:53.573]  It's Congress.
[01:54:53.733 --> 01:55:03.018]  It's an act of Congress and it requires that you obey it unless it's authorized by the Constitution or by Congress.
[01:55:03.838 --> 01:55:07.160]  And so Bush cannot independently rescind it.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.621]  Furthermore, you have to ask why would they need
[01:55:11.039 --> 01:55:11.619]  To rescind it.
[01:55:11.779 --> 01:55:19.267]  I suppose they could say, though they wouldn't want to say it, they could say that, well, we sent the whole National Guard through Iraq and we don't have any to send down there.
[01:55:20.288 --> 01:55:21.909]  And that, of course, was not legal either.
[01:55:21.929 --> 01:55:24.692]  Yeah, now they're having to send a regular army.
[01:55:25.033 --> 01:55:32.360]  So they could say that it's a shortage of National Guard troops that we had to send in the regular army, but there's still enough National Guard troops.
[01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:34.591]  Paul, we always said this.
[01:55:34.711 --> 01:55:40.296]  We're going to have troops tied down overseas, and then there's going to be a terror attack, and they're going to use foreign troops.
[01:55:40.876 --> 01:55:46.500]  Already 20% of the army on the ground in Iraq is Latin American, who instantly are legalized for signing up.
[01:55:47.141 --> 01:55:52.845]  And as crazy as it sounds, folks, yes, this really is the plan.
[01:55:52.865 --> 01:55:55.207]  We're now starting to see it unfold.
[01:55:55.768 --> 01:55:59.951]  And basically, federal troops are foreign troops, foreign to our state's.
[01:56:00.351 --> 01:56:02.812]  And if you don't know what that means, you haven't read your Constitution.
[01:56:02.872 --> 01:56:03.172]  Paul?
[01:56:05.032 --> 01:56:21.916]  Well, I'm looking here at the Washington University Law School Law Review, and it says here that the act criminalizes effectively prohibiting the use of regular troops.
[01:56:22.176 --> 01:56:23.796]  Perseverance, seizures, and imps.
[01:56:24.784 --> 01:56:45.394]  And it says that whoever except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress willfully uses any part of the Army as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the law shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both.
[01:56:46.174 --> 01:56:47.775]  Well, Bush has violated that.
[01:56:48.275 --> 01:56:53.698]  So, if we had a rule of law, Bush would be fined and or imprisoned for two years.
[01:56:53.858 --> 01:56:53.978]  So,
[01:56:54.947 --> 01:56:57.588]  But again, they've deliberately caused this.
[01:56:57.868 --> 01:57:02.650]  You send the National Guard that is the Guard with the states out, then you've got to use regular Army.
[01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:08.112]  Well, I still maintain they had enough National Guard to do without the regular Army.
[01:57:08.132 --> 01:57:09.653]  They did around the rest of the country, yes.
[01:57:09.673 --> 01:57:10.973]  They sent the regular Army.
[01:57:11.753 --> 01:57:15.595]  Anyhow, I mean... It's unbelievable.
[01:57:15.655 --> 01:57:16.815]  Paul, stay there, okay?
[01:57:18.116 --> 01:57:18.396]  Yeah.
[01:57:19.696 --> 01:57:20.157]  We're going to break.
[01:57:20.177 --> 01:57:20.797]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:22.156 --> 01:57:23.177]  Talking to Paul Grant Roberts.
[01:57:23.217 --> 01:57:23.997]  Mike, finish the call.
[01:57:24.077 --> 01:57:24.817]  Great question.
[01:57:24.917 --> 01:57:28.979]  Sean, Wes, Will, and everybody else.
[01:57:29.019 --> 01:57:31.340]  Your calls when we start the third hour.
[01:57:33.862 --> 01:57:37.463]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.723 --> 01:57:38.064]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.864 --> 01:57:50.524]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:52.244]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.945 --> 01:57:54.045]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.705 --> 01:57:55.505]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.265 --> 01:57:57.205]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.846 --> 01:58:01.786]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.026 --> 01:58:06.127]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.528 --> 01:58:15.189]  You know, it is mental illness to have a thousand indicators...
[01:58:16.027 --> 01:58:24.134]  You have your own eyes, your own mind, your own hearing, your own touch, your own taste to look at something and then to deny that it's there in front of you.
[01:58:25.335 --> 01:58:33.742]  And clearly criminal elements in the government who want to set up a police state in America did everything they could to make sure this disaster blew up.
[01:58:35.693 --> 01:58:37.814]  And they knew it was coming.
[01:58:37.894 --> 01:58:38.594]  They knew.
[01:58:39.355 --> 01:58:41.075]  Everybody was screaming and yelling about it.
[01:58:41.135 --> 01:58:43.096]  We'd done shows on this.
[01:58:43.156 --> 01:58:44.577]  Why aren't they fixing New Orleans?
[01:58:44.997 --> 01:58:46.258]  But we've got troops in Iraq.
[01:58:47.998 --> 01:58:49.259]  Why is the border wide open?
[01:58:49.279 --> 01:58:51.880]  But they say terrorists are about to sneak nukes across any minute.
[01:58:53.061 --> 01:58:54.301]  And terrorists could do that.
[01:58:55.001 --> 01:59:00.804]  And then, still, when it happens, the government won't get in any trouble.
[01:59:02.785 --> 01:59:03.786]  From leaving the border wide open.
[01:59:03.966 --> 01:59:05.928]  I mean, there's a disconnect here.
[01:59:06.328 --> 01:59:09.451]  The government can't protect you, won't protect you, will never protect you.
[01:59:09.751 --> 01:59:12.613]  Now we have no gun sales or bullet sales on Louisiana.
[01:59:13.594 --> 01:59:14.375]  Cartridge sales.
[01:59:14.495 --> 01:59:15.936]  I mean, and this could go nationwide.
[01:59:16.376 --> 01:59:18.458]  The economy, it could have major repercussions.
[01:59:18.498 --> 01:59:19.219]  It already is.
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:26.725]  And we're talking to Paul Craig Roberts, who was Assistant Secretary for the Treasury, Economic Policy during the Reagan administration.
[01:59:27.185 --> 01:59:28.867]  I mean, he set the economic policy, folks.
[01:59:29.688 --> 01:59:32.432]  And he's here calling for Bush's impeachment.
[01:59:33.013 --> 01:59:37.098]  Let's, Paul, for this segment and one more segment, that's it, we're honored to have him.
[01:59:37.439 --> 01:59:39.201]  Let's go to another caller here.
[01:59:39.702 --> 01:59:43.487]  Sean in California, thank you for holding for time immemorial.
[01:59:43.527 --> 01:59:44.088]  You're on the air.
[01:59:44.768 --> 01:59:46.289]  Hi, Alex and Mr. Roberts.
[01:59:46.389 --> 01:59:52.974]  Isn't it telling that the martial law establishment of New Orleans can have their new magnetic and laser-based sound weaponry shipped in from California?
[01:59:53.234 --> 01:59:53.694]  Well, that's right.
[01:59:53.714 --> 01:59:55.856]  I saw that in New York at the RNC.
[01:59:55.916 --> 02:00:06.403]  Now they've got even more powerful third-generation eardrum-busting cannons being shipped in, and they had those shipped in before they even had the water in there.
[02:00:06.423 --> 02:00:07.904]  Let's get a comment from Paul on that.
[02:00:08.484 --> 02:00:09.805]  There's no need for those weapons.
[02:00:09.945 --> 02:00:13.708]  There's nothing there but poor people dependent on federal welfare.
[02:00:14.628 --> 02:00:15.849]  This whole thing is absurd.
[02:00:16.489 --> 02:00:21.012]  The main looters were people who were out of food and water.
[02:00:21.332 --> 02:00:24.614]  And the other looters were the drug addicts, dying for a fix.
[02:00:24.674 --> 02:00:27.756]  That's why they broke into the hospitals and the drug stores.
[02:00:28.917 --> 02:00:37.422]  And they can't get a single chopper in the air equipped with ground-penetrating radar or simple heat-sensing apparatus to do flyovers of the flooded areas to find people trapped in their attics.
[02:00:37.783 --> 02:00:40.424]  There's no need for these weapons.
[02:00:40.544 --> 02:00:43.026]  This is not an armed insurrection.
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:46.042]  In New Orleans or Louisiana.
[02:00:46.703 --> 02:00:53.889]  Listen, Alex, if you still have those people holing from Tokyo and Germany, they're going broke hanging on these long-distance lines.
[02:00:53.909 --> 02:00:55.791]  You better take them first if they're still there.
[02:00:55.811 --> 02:00:56.011]  Right.
[02:00:56.391 --> 02:00:57.172]  You know, I'll do that.
[02:00:57.412 --> 02:00:59.394]  Anything else, Sean?
[02:00:59.454 --> 02:01:09.983]  Well, on the parish president, Broussard, he said FEMA did all this bad stuff on Meet the Press, but then he went on to say that FEMA needs more power in the full audio clip.
[02:01:10.661 --> 02:01:12.262]  It was an example of double-think.
[02:01:12.322 --> 02:01:17.026]  And Rumsfeld denied the Army Times article about combat operations.
[02:01:17.046 --> 02:01:19.848]  He said, no, we're not involved in that in a press conference with the Joint Chiefs.
[02:01:19.928 --> 02:01:22.530]  The Army Times was there.
[02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:24.872]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:25.052 --> 02:01:25.933]  Let's go to Japan.
[02:01:26.393 --> 02:01:27.334]  Wes in Japan.
[02:01:27.374 --> 02:01:28.375]  Thanks for holding, Wes.
[02:01:28.695 --> 02:01:29.355]  You're on the air.
[02:01:29.375 --> 02:01:30.716]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:01:30.817 --> 02:01:31.057]  Good.
[02:01:31.077 --> 02:01:39.243]  I don't know if you heard this story or not, but on June 5th on Fox News, Fox Network, they aired a movie called Oil Storms.
[02:01:39.915 --> 02:01:51.765]  And the script is the hurricane scenario, almost to the T. Just like the lone gunman story before 9-11, this is a hurricane hits no means, all of that.
[02:01:52.525 --> 02:01:55.368]  And so, for me, it was totally designed.
[02:01:55.468 --> 02:01:56.368]  That's the way I see it.
[02:01:56.809 --> 02:02:02.333]  And I found this story on cuttingedge.org, where they detail all the background on it, on weapons, on weather warfare.
[02:02:02.433 --> 02:02:06.737]  And coming from their own government publications, admitting that this technology exists.
[02:02:07.566 --> 02:02:11.688]  And so, I don't know if you've come across, I did see some articles on your site the other day.
[02:02:11.868 --> 02:02:17.131]  Yes, you know, we, back in June, we played the promo for Oil Storm.
[02:02:17.171 --> 02:02:21.093]  Let me get a comment from Paul, Craig Roberts, on the other side on that.
[02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:23.154]  What are you doing over in Japan, my friend?
[02:02:23.175 --> 02:02:28.657]  Oh, I worked as a contractor here for the local base, the Navy.
[02:02:28.718 --> 02:02:30.298]  What do the Japanese think of this?
[02:02:31.459 --> 02:02:32.039]  It's hard to get.
[02:02:32.059 --> 02:02:33.220]  They don't really pay attention.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:36.422]  They think it's chaotic, and they feel sorry for us, but...
[02:02:37.856 --> 02:02:42.977]  I mean, they're not really big Bush supporters either, but they're not in tune with the whole thing.
[02:02:42.997 --> 02:02:43.637]  Anyway, stay there.
[02:02:46.498 --> 02:02:49.359]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.599 --> 02:02:51.179]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.519 --> 02:02:56.220]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:03.262]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.602 --> 02:03:05.583]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.783 --> 02:03:08.644]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.724 --> 02:03:13.385]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.585 --> 02:03:17.987]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.227 --> 02:03:25.469]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.710 --> 02:03:28.130]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.290 --> 02:03:30.031]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:03:30.171 --> 02:03:36.179]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[02:03:45.993 --> 02:03:47.614]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.755 --> 02:03:51.878]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.998 --> 02:03:54.881]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.961 --> 02:04:01.687]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.847 --> 02:04:04.870]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:07.452]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.592 --> 02:04:12.176]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:12.236 --> 02:04:12.976]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.125 --> 02:04:37.245]  803-4438.
[02:04:37.285 --> 02:04:40.466]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:43.788]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:45.528 --> 02:04:48.069]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[02:04:48.129 --> 02:04:51.711]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[02:04:51.831 --> 02:04:52.211]  Shocking?
[02:04:52.311 --> 02:04:52.751]  Of course.
[02:04:53.031 --> 02:04:55.092]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[02:04:55.252 --> 02:04:58.133]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[02:04:58.353 --> 02:04:59.714]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[02:04:59.874 --> 02:05:04.135]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott's Ph.D.
[02:05:04.315 --> 02:05:05.736]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[02:05:05.776 --> 02:05:06.216]  We're good to go.

[02:05:45.511 --> 02:05:51.136]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.376 --> 02:05:58.641]  All right, listening to us at a military base in Japan, a contractor for a base in Japan, Wes in Japan.
[02:05:58.721 --> 02:05:59.882]  Wes, finish up your point.
[02:06:00.863 --> 02:06:01.524]  Oh, that was it.
[02:06:01.544 --> 02:06:05.266]  I didn't know if you had already run the story or not, but that was just, you know, coincidence.
[02:06:05.366 --> 02:06:05.847]  I don't know.
[02:06:06.087 --> 02:06:10.350]  Well, I know I have Secretary of Defense Cohen admitting that there are earthquake and weather weapons.
[02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:11.231]  I know that I've got...
[02:06:12.617 --> 02:06:14.217]  Weather Channel shows about it.
[02:06:14.277 --> 02:06:15.958]  I know I've got legislation about it.
[02:06:17.178 --> 02:06:25.560]  There's no evidence for me that some group or government can make hurricanes or can steer hurricanes.
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:29.000]  I mean, look, I don't put it past them.
[02:06:29.641 --> 02:06:32.161]  But the problem is I stick with what I can prove.
[02:06:33.021 --> 02:06:41.663]  And I don't agree with the weather wars guy, the meteorologist who works for a major TV station, folks, who thinks that it's some group.
[02:06:42.735 --> 02:06:45.936]  But again, I stick with what I can prove.
[02:06:45.976 --> 02:06:46.776]  And I know this.
[02:06:47.637 --> 02:06:54.019]  The government, it took work to make sure those people didn't get aid.
[02:06:54.639 --> 02:06:56.079]  I mean, they cut lines.
[02:06:56.139 --> 02:06:57.500]  They didn't let food get in.
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:58.860]  They stopped police.
[02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:02.141]  And then meanwhile, the police are out looting.
[02:07:02.261 --> 02:07:07.863]  So, you know, the feds, what Paul Craig Roberts said in the last hour was so important.
[02:07:08.603 --> 02:07:12.184]  And it fits in with the fact, and everybody knows this, the guidelines
[02:07:13.251 --> 02:07:24.282]  If you take any federal money, they set all the guidelines and have their people there watching what you do, watching what you set up, watching what you create, what operations you run.
[02:07:24.302 --> 02:07:27.425]  You've got to follow their book exactly.
[02:07:28.045 --> 02:07:32.390]  And, man, folks, they had them stand down.
[02:07:32.450 --> 02:07:33.090]  Thanks for the call.
[02:07:33.391 --> 02:07:35.813]  Paul, do you want to elaborate on that ending?
[02:07:35.853 --> 02:07:37.735]  No, that's all over my head, Alex.
[02:07:40.367 --> 02:07:41.287]  It's not over your head.
[02:07:41.307 --> 02:07:43.288]  You're the one that brought up the key point.
[02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:49.051]  Oh, I thought you meant about these fantastic weapons.
[02:07:49.651 --> 02:07:50.972]  Oh, weather weapons.
[02:07:51.012 --> 02:07:51.732]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:07:51.792 --> 02:07:53.413]  No, I meant the point you brought up.
[02:07:54.054 --> 02:08:02.018]  I mean, for people who don't know, especially in New Orleans, folks, I mean, that city was purely federalized two years ago, times Picayune.
[02:08:02.058 --> 02:08:05.940]  They took control, and then so the blame it on the locals is,
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:15.567]  That'd be like if I was a general and I gave my captains and colonels and majors the exact battle plan and they executed it flawlessly but lost the battle.
[02:08:16.187 --> 02:08:18.909]  And then if I blamed them for having a bad battle plan.
[02:08:19.229 --> 02:08:25.494]  See, look, the state and locals don't have the resources and they don't control the resources.
[02:08:26.234 --> 02:08:29.677]  And anyone with a lick of sense already knows that.
[02:08:30.578 --> 02:08:35.221]  And so I think the issue really is, and since we can't,
[02:08:35.802 --> 02:08:43.684]  Prove, at least at this point, why this failure happened, this failure of response to a disaster happened.
[02:08:45.164 --> 02:08:55.966]  What we can stand on very firmly is that this was an extraordinary incompetence and it's criminal negligence and there has to be accountability.
[02:08:56.026 --> 02:09:03.908]  So if we can demand that, whether or not we have proof that it was intended to happen,
[02:09:04.488 --> 02:09:08.111]  The fact is, the important fact is, that it did happen.
[02:09:08.791 --> 02:09:12.094]  And this was a massive failure of the federal government.
[02:09:12.894 --> 02:09:16.797]  And it is criminally negligent.
[02:09:17.438 --> 02:09:19.880]  And there must be accountability.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:23.783]  That's really all we need to go further.
[02:09:24.003 --> 02:09:29.167]  What did you think of Bush giving large portions of the contracts to Halliburton?
[02:09:31.028 --> 02:09:31.329]  You know...
[02:09:32.905 --> 02:09:36.048]  It's such blatant cronyism.
[02:09:36.388 --> 02:09:38.249]  It's just like in Iraq.
[02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:45.595]  You know, in the high-level civil servant, the woman who blew the whistle on it, they demote her.
[02:09:47.336 --> 02:09:49.878]  So the civil service has lost its protection, too.
[02:09:49.918 --> 02:09:52.080]  When I was president, you couldn't just...
[02:09:54.065 --> 02:09:56.146]  Go around demoting civil servants.
[02:09:56.206 --> 02:09:57.707]  I mean, you literally couldn't touch them.
[02:09:57.828 --> 02:09:59.389]  It'd take about two years.
[02:09:59.629 --> 02:10:02.911]  Well, they're demoting or firing people left and right when they blow the whistle.
[02:10:03.531 --> 02:10:06.173]  You know, that's what I'm pointing out.
[02:10:06.213 --> 02:10:11.717]  The law and procedure is collapsing all across the front.
[02:10:11.977 --> 02:10:19.262]  So even their own bureaucratic rules are... I mean, wouldn't you call this executive lawlessness?
[02:10:21.443 --> 02:10:23.845]  It's like a dictatorship.
[02:10:25.453 --> 02:10:29.656]  Look, you know, Hitler didn't inherit a dictatorship, did he?
[02:10:29.736 --> 02:10:35.760]  I mean, he inherited the institutions of a free society.
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:36.741]  Weimar Republic!
[02:10:37.101 --> 02:10:37.921]  He corrupted them.
[02:10:37.961 --> 02:10:52.471]  You know, when the German courts would turn loose people that he wanted them, you know, punished or something, and the courts would absolve them and let them loose, the Gestapo would pick them up in the streets when they walked out of the court and carry them off anyhow.
[02:10:54.361 --> 02:11:01.051]  So if you don't obey, if you can't make the laws twist to work your purpose,
[02:11:01.644 --> 02:11:02.464]  You ignore them.
[02:11:02.864 --> 02:11:04.065]  You know, it's funny you'd say that.
[02:11:04.105 --> 02:11:09.146]  They've been setting up all these new parallel courts locally and at the state and federal level.
[02:11:10.626 --> 02:11:12.966]  I mean, forget for terrorist stuff not having your rights.
[02:11:13.526 --> 02:11:26.889]  In family law or even in just petty crime here in Austin, they say on the news, well, you thought you were innocent until proven guilty, but now you leave the jail, we make you waive your rights and sign on to probation.
[02:11:27.189 --> 02:11:28.369]  I mean, for petty stuff.
[02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:31.370]  Really, we are seeing a high-tech...
[02:11:32.723 --> 02:11:34.144]  Nightmare being set up here.
[02:11:34.424 --> 02:11:36.164]  I think that's right.
[02:11:36.204 --> 02:11:45.748]  I've been writing for years about the destruction of our civil liberties and of the legal principles that protect the innocent from arbitrary power of government.
[02:11:46.288 --> 02:11:47.809]  And that is a very serious thing.
[02:11:47.849 --> 02:11:50.610]  And I think we see that across the board.
[02:11:51.585 --> 02:11:58.651]  It happens even to protected people like senior civil service officials whose job is to blow the whistle.
[02:11:58.731 --> 02:12:00.953]  I mean, that's what the woman was supposed to do.
[02:12:01.534 --> 02:12:06.558]  She did her job and they busted her for doing her job and they don't have the authority.
[02:12:08.608 --> 02:12:16.490]  Craig Roberts, do you think this imperial hubris, just this insane aplomb and arrogance, though?
[02:12:17.170 --> 02:12:23.671]  I mean, it's dangerous to the elite because they're getting more and more sloppy, but it's the imperial rule that no one can challenge them.
[02:12:24.031 --> 02:12:28.592]  So isn't it really just a slippery slope just into maximum tyranny?
[02:12:28.612 --> 02:12:30.453]  I mean, is there anything to hold it back?
[02:12:32.763 --> 02:12:52.664]  The only thing that could hold it back would be if the people just got outraged and it forced the Republicans to turn on him and it forced the Democrats to become an opposition party again and it left the mainstream media off the scene.
[02:12:53.184 --> 02:12:55.306]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[02:12:57.162 --> 02:13:01.164]  I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but you are right.
[02:13:01.704 --> 02:13:05.506]  The slippery slope, we're not only on it, we're a good ways down it.
[02:13:06.046 --> 02:13:10.428]  And you have to keep in mind that a terrorist is whoever they say is a terrorist.
[02:13:10.568 --> 02:13:11.129]  It could be you.
[02:13:11.229 --> 02:13:12.069]  It could be me.
[02:13:12.089 --> 02:13:13.630]  It could be your mother.
[02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:15.371]  It's just up to them.
[02:13:16.671 --> 02:13:18.412]  There's no evidence required.
[02:13:19.614 --> 02:13:21.575]  Well, it's like it's a big national secret.
[02:13:21.615 --> 02:13:23.076]  It's in all these regional papers.
[02:13:23.456 --> 02:13:25.437]  Toy stores getting Homeland Security visits.
[02:13:25.497 --> 02:13:27.097]  Doctors getting Homeland Security visits.
[02:13:27.518 --> 02:13:28.218]  Pot dealers.
[02:13:28.678 --> 02:13:29.618]  Totless bars.
[02:13:29.999 --> 02:13:33.560]  They're just establishing... Homeless people.
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.662]  They're establishing illegitimate authority by exercising it.
[02:13:38.262 --> 02:13:38.702]  Exactly.
[02:13:38.722 --> 02:13:41.464]  They're creating bad precedent.
[02:13:43.665 --> 02:13:49.007]  If you exercise authority over and over and you're not stopped and no one stops you, you're not held accountable.
[02:13:50.263 --> 02:14:16.062]  It's just like the other day, the federal judge who said, well, he didn't think he could order the release of the second batch of Abu Ghraib prison videos because they're so horrible that the commandant chief of the United States Army, Myers, had said, gosh, if we release these, the Arabs will get so mad they'll kill more of our troops.
[02:14:17.223 --> 02:14:18.564]  So he acknowledges that
[02:14:19.688 --> 02:14:30.098]  Evidence exists of criminal actions by American troops and officers, but he's not going to let anybody know about it.
[02:14:30.218 --> 02:14:31.139]  You know, that's crazy.
[02:14:31.519 --> 02:14:32.039]  I saw that.
[02:14:32.119 --> 02:14:39.206]  His defense for not releasing video of them raping children, folks, just in case you didn't know, Cy Hirsch has seen it.
[02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:41.799]  How in the... And I have to use this word.
[02:14:41.839 --> 02:14:42.640]  This is hell on earth.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:49.864]  How in the world people could... Listen, the neocons rationalize it, Paul, as you know.
[02:14:49.884 --> 02:14:51.185]  Look, see what they're doing?
[02:14:51.205 --> 02:14:52.346]  They're turning the U.S.
[02:14:52.406 --> 02:14:55.147]  military, the honorable U.S.
[02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:58.009]  military, into the Waffen-SS.
[02:14:58.249 --> 02:14:59.070]  That's what they're doing.
[02:14:59.970 --> 02:15:04.453]  And whoever they unleash it on, it will be merciless.
[02:15:04.553 --> 02:15:07.395]  But even the armed SS didn't brag about it on TV.
[02:15:07.995 --> 02:15:09.156]  Well, they didn't have TV.
[02:15:09.975 --> 02:15:10.636]  That's a good point.
[02:15:10.656 --> 02:15:13.038]  We don't know what they said to one another.
[02:15:13.058 --> 02:15:16.000]  I think you're probably right.
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:21.084]  It was probably something that even many of them were ashamed of.
[02:15:21.725 --> 02:15:24.888]  But shame is another thing that's departed.
[02:15:25.888 --> 02:15:35.697]  Even the things that control the beast in the human nature, those are gone too, like shame, integrity, honor.
[02:15:35.797 --> 02:15:37.198]  Nobody knows what that is anymore.
[02:15:38.183 --> 02:15:44.325]  And then when you take away the legal protections as well, there's nothing there but a beast.
[02:15:44.445 --> 02:15:50.146]  I mean, it's an unrestrained beast, and that's how I think of the slippery slope.
[02:15:50.266 --> 02:15:55.808]  We're really preparing ourselves to be ravaged in the most incredible ways.
[02:15:56.168 --> 02:15:59.749]  And for those in the establishment that think this is cute and want to exercise power,
[02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:04.373]  I mean, no one is safe in a system like this.
[02:16:04.613 --> 02:16:05.033]  That's right.
[02:16:05.373 --> 02:16:08.195]  I mean, look at the decline of the Roman Empire when they had two emperors.
[02:16:08.556 --> 02:16:09.716]  Just look at the Soviet Union.
[02:16:09.736 --> 02:16:14.820]  I mean, look what happened in the Stalin years.
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:17.682]  Every single Bolshevik hero he exterminated.
[02:16:19.063 --> 02:16:21.505]  I mean, even look what Hitler did to his own brown shirts.
[02:16:23.346 --> 02:16:23.466]  So...
[02:16:24.305 --> 02:16:25.345]  No one is safe.
[02:16:25.405 --> 02:16:26.366]  Night of the Long Knives.
[02:16:26.386 --> 02:16:28.306]  He exterminated Ernst Röhm and all of them.
[02:16:28.606 --> 02:16:30.487]  See, no one is safe.
[02:16:30.667 --> 02:16:38.769]  And where the power is going, it's going into the bureaucratized federal agencies with police powers.
[02:16:38.789 --> 02:16:39.790]  That's where the power is.
[02:16:39.870 --> 02:16:43.691]  It's not even really going to politicians or...
[02:16:44.842 --> 02:16:59.452]  Well, that's what I brought... I mean, you must know your history, Paul Kirk Roberts, because that's when I said the two emperors, you know, in the final days of Rome, every six months, a general would just overthrow the Caesar and make himself Caesar, and then somebody else would overthrow him.
[02:16:59.792 --> 02:17:07.417]  I mean, the climate that these international corporations manipulating our government have created is just totally toxic.
[02:17:13.161 --> 02:17:13.862]  I don't know how many...
[02:17:14.485 --> 02:17:21.907]  More catastrophic examples of incompetence the country can stand.
[02:17:21.947 --> 02:17:24.908]  We've certainly had a lot of them in the Bush regime.
[02:17:25.408 --> 02:17:36.372]  Paul, I know you have stayed longer than you even said you could, and I really do want to thank you for coming on with us here on air today, but I'd like to hold you there just for a second.
[02:17:36.392 --> 02:17:39.993]  I'd like to speak to you off air here during the break, but I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:17:40.293 --> 02:17:40.893]  Okay, Alex.
[02:17:40.973 --> 02:17:41.834]  I'm pleased to be on.
[02:17:42.154 --> 02:17:42.474]  You bet.
[02:17:42.494 --> 02:17:43.154]  Stay right there a second.

[02:20:55.695 --> 02:21:01.561]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.

[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:54.106]  I was talking to Paul during the break, and he said he likes taking your calls, so I guess he'll ride shotgun with us for this little short segment.
[02:21:54.166 --> 02:21:55.787]  If he wants to go longer, he's welcome to.
[02:21:56.387 --> 02:21:58.448]  Right now, let's go straight back to the calls.
[02:21:59.489 --> 02:22:00.890]  And who's up next here in order?
[02:22:02.431 --> 02:22:02.831]  Will.
[02:22:02.891 --> 02:22:05.132]  Will, where are you calling us from today, Will?
[02:22:05.633 --> 02:22:06.733]  This is Will in Missouri.
[02:22:06.813 --> 02:22:09.115]  Alex and Paul, and thank you for taking my call.
[02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:30.232]  You know, if there were no other explanation for the administration's gross negligence and complete disregard for human life, liberty, property, and state rights, the examination of the maps of the Stimulated Wildlands Project will show that the Mississippi River Basin, from the Missouri Bootheel south all the way to the Gulf of Mexico,
[02:22:32.350 --> 02:22:39.096]  Well, I would say you were smoking, well, that leaf that didn't tobacco.
[02:22:39.116 --> 02:22:44.001]  If I hadn't made a film, my first film, off of the U.N.
[02:22:44.061 --> 02:22:53.370]  Wilding Project, which they even had on ABC News a few weeks ago, and openly they do want to flood that entire area, and I saw that demon.
[02:22:54.071 --> 02:23:14.503]  Mary Landrieu, who stole her way into that Senator seat, Mary Landrieu, day two, on CNN, I have the witch on tape, by the way, saying that this is because we didn't wild the wetlands, and we didn't... And she's the creature who's helped tear down a bunch of dams and dikes and levees.
[02:23:14.843 --> 02:23:18.645]  And so they've actually, the environmentalists, have helped flood that area.
[02:23:18.925 --> 02:23:19.746]  And you're right, sir.
[02:23:19.786 --> 02:23:21.147]  Let me get a comment from Paul on that.
[02:23:21.187 --> 02:23:21.367]  Paul?
[02:23:22.182 --> 02:23:27.185]  Well, Alex, I'm not sure you understood what the caller was saying.
[02:23:29.226 --> 02:23:47.155]  What I understood him to say and what I think is correct, Alex, is that when you don't preserve the wetlands and you drain them and turn them over to developers, you greatly increase the damage from floods and the risk of floods and that many of the wetlands that are
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:54.984]  That we're protective of that area from water surges that have been drained.
[02:23:55.104 --> 02:23:57.325]  And I think that's what he was saying, but maybe not.
[02:23:57.365 --> 02:23:58.666]  But that is my understanding.
[02:23:58.686 --> 02:24:00.307]  And I'm saying the opposite, basically.
[02:24:00.447 --> 02:24:05.289]  That's my understanding of the... Will, what were you saying?
[02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:08.111]  Well, this is far more egregious than that, Alex and Paul.
[02:24:08.519 --> 02:24:21.448]  Because in the wilderness reserve corridors, as were agreed to and decided upon by the Sustainable Development Group, and as you will recall, George... What you're saying is they want all this to flood, so they're letting it flood.
[02:24:21.588 --> 02:24:28.973]  These are areas that are now in consideration of being off-limits to all human activity, so there's absolutely no doubt... Oh, yeah, those maps have been in Congress.
[02:24:28.993 --> 02:24:30.895]  Have you seen Dr. Coleman's maps?
[02:24:31.275 --> 02:24:32.936]  I have a copy of them in front of me.
[02:24:32.996 --> 02:24:34.277]  I was asking Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:24:35.081 --> 02:24:36.302]  No, I haven't seen those maps.
[02:24:36.722 --> 02:24:38.203]  We need to get those to you.
[02:24:38.243 --> 02:25:02.175]  But I do have a home in a coastal area and I'm very much aware that local governments and sometimes state governments and developers go far beyond any prudence and they, in order to maximize their own profits in the short run, they expose
[02:25:03.702 --> 02:25:06.644]  Others there to serious problems.
[02:25:07.204 --> 02:25:08.505]  Well, that certainly is true as well.
[02:25:08.565 --> 02:25:10.326]  Thank you for the call there, Will.
[02:25:10.707 --> 02:25:12.368]  Let's talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:25:12.388 --> 02:25:13.348]  You're on the air, Elias.
[02:25:13.368 --> 02:25:13.848]  Go ahead.
[02:25:14.889 --> 02:25:18.491]  Hello, Mr. Robert.
[02:25:18.772 --> 02:25:23.995]  I'd like to bring up the First Amendment to the Constitution and what it really means.
[02:25:24.355 --> 02:25:25.155]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:25:25.496 --> 02:25:32.380]  We are unaware of what the First Amendment really means.
[02:25:33.771 --> 02:25:38.900]  It gives a protection to a private thing known as the press.
[02:25:39.821 --> 02:25:43.768]  The press and free speech were meant to bring to the surface
[02:25:45.547 --> 02:25:47.829]  All the things that the government will want to hide.
[02:25:47.989 --> 02:25:49.690]  Yeah, that's why it comes first.
[02:25:49.970 --> 02:25:53.333]  That's what free speech and free press, the First Amendment, is all about.
[02:25:53.353 --> 02:25:56.555]  Well, sir, you're engaging in it right now, so what do you want to say?
[02:25:56.615 --> 02:25:57.096]  He's right.
[02:25:57.256 --> 02:25:58.136]  He's exactly right.
[02:25:58.217 --> 02:25:59.077]  That's what it's for.
[02:25:59.417 --> 02:26:06.623]  It's not for people like Howard Stern to put out his blather or people to be free to yell and shout.
[02:26:07.344 --> 02:26:08.387]  That's not what it's all about.
[02:26:08.708 --> 02:26:11.575]  It wasn't meant as a defense of pornography, for example.
[02:26:11.595 --> 02:26:15.565]  Well, aside from that, it was the framers set up...
[02:26:16.141 --> 02:26:19.082]  It's a special thing for the press.
[02:26:19.802 --> 02:26:24.803]  It's a special... But Elias, because of that, we've got to tolerate speech we don't like.
[02:26:26.103 --> 02:26:28.283]  But the press is not bringing out these things.
[02:26:28.543 --> 02:26:32.624]  So a great mass of people now are wallowing in ignorance.
[02:26:32.864 --> 02:26:35.984]  They don't even know what the First Amendment is all about.
[02:26:36.104 --> 02:26:42.826]  I agree with you that to destroy a people, you've got to take their history and their past away, and that's happening.
[02:26:42.866 --> 02:26:44.326]  You see, what the caller is...
[02:26:45.504 --> 02:26:53.068]  It's bringing out is that the free press in America was free and effective as long as it was independent.
[02:26:53.628 --> 02:26:56.389]  But now there's really about three conglomerates that own it all.
[02:26:57.250 --> 02:27:01.912]  All the independent newspapers have disappeared into chains and they're owned by bigger chains.
[02:27:02.992 --> 02:27:08.335]  And all of these conglomerates are dependent on the federal government for their broadcast licenses, for their radio and TV.
[02:27:08.875 --> 02:27:11.597]  And so they really have clamped down.
[02:27:11.637 --> 02:27:12.397]  They're afraid...
[02:27:13.146 --> 02:27:16.309]  To say too much that the government doesn't want.
[02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:17.910]  I'll tell you what, Paul.
[02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:19.371]  You want to stay a few more minutes?
[02:27:19.391 --> 02:27:19.791]  You want to go?
[02:27:21.153 --> 02:27:22.494]  I'm going to leave at this time, Alex.
[02:27:22.574 --> 02:27:22.834]  All right.
[02:27:22.894 --> 02:27:25.136]  Paul Craig Roberts, thank you for coming on with us, my friend.
[02:27:25.176 --> 02:27:26.056]  It was my pleasure.
[02:27:26.096 --> 02:27:27.678]  And thank you for sharing your audience.
[02:27:27.918 --> 02:27:28.178]  You bet.
[02:27:28.198 --> 02:27:29.239]  Look forward to talking to you again.
[02:27:29.259 --> 02:27:29.799]  All right.
[02:27:29.819 --> 02:27:32.041]  We'll come back and take more of your calls after this quick break.
[02:27:32.081 --> 02:27:33.402]  And we've got some audio clips as well.
[02:27:36.004 --> 02:27:36.945]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.386 --> 02:27:38.987]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.908 --> 02:27:42.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.326 --> 02:27:52.692]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.892 --> 02:27:57.916]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.237 --> 02:28:06.144]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.304 --> 02:28:13.350]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:14.772]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.912 --> 02:28:18.317]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.377 --> 02:28:21.060]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.261 --> 02:28:28.090]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:28.210 --> 02:28:30.674]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:30.814 --> 02:28:33.756]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.

[02:28:33.836 --> 02:28:34.797]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.098 --> 02:28:47.719]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.839 --> 02:28:51.981]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.081 --> 02:28:54.963]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.043 --> 02:29:01.726]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.946 --> 02:29:04.950]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:07.534]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.694 --> 02:29:17.807]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:29:18.127 --> 02:29:20.509]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:47.774 --> 02:29:54.636]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:29:54.896 --> 02:29:57.257]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:29:57.517 --> 02:29:59.477]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:29:59.817 --> 02:30:05.159]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:30:05.559 --> 02:30:09.844]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:30:10.284 --> 02:30:18.192]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[02:30:18.372 --> 02:30:23.438]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:30:23.458 --> 02:30:25.540]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:26.780]  All right, I'm going to...
[02:30:51.658 --> 02:30:56.601]  I'm going to take some more of your calls and go through some more of the news to a recap of what we're facing right now.
[02:30:58.242 --> 02:31:00.244]  We've got three audio clips coming up as well.
[02:31:02.865 --> 02:31:09.009]  But just think about the magnitude of what Paul Craig Roberts was saying.
[02:31:09.049 --> 02:31:11.251]  I mean, I interviewed him six, eight months ago.
[02:31:11.311 --> 02:31:14.653]  He wasn't a tenth as radical as he's sounding now.
[02:31:15.473 --> 02:31:17.875]  You should have heard the discussions I had with him during the break.
[02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:20.571]  I mean, thinking minds, look at this.
[02:31:20.791 --> 02:31:22.451]  Martial law is being set up.
[02:31:22.491 --> 02:31:23.452]  You heard him talk about that.
[02:31:24.152 --> 02:31:26.173]  The government uses every crisis they can.
[02:31:26.213 --> 02:31:27.133]  They accentuate it.
[02:31:27.153 --> 02:31:30.434]  They make it worse to get control.
[02:31:32.235 --> 02:31:38.357]  And look, I mean, so many people are seeing it like we are.
[02:31:39.117 --> 02:31:40.378]  So many prominent people.
[02:31:42.338 --> 02:31:43.879]  So many prominent conservatives.
[02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:48.530]  And folks, Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and these people, they're not conservatives.
[02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:51.531]  They're master manipulators.
[02:31:51.591 --> 02:31:53.152]  They only tell you part of the story.
[02:31:53.532 --> 02:31:55.793]  The Democrats love all this stuff that's happening.
[02:31:56.173 --> 02:31:59.714]  Oh, you'll hear some rhetoric out of them, but somebody's got to be punished.
[02:31:59.734 --> 02:32:00.935]  You know, in a third world country...
[02:32:01.690 --> 02:32:02.070]  We're good to go.
[02:32:21.949 --> 02:32:24.231]  Well, this isn't a screw-up.
[02:32:24.771 --> 02:32:29.554]  I talked to Paul on air, and you heard him say it all points towards the government being involved.
[02:32:29.995 --> 02:32:31.716]  But off air, he was even more explicit.
[02:32:32.296 --> 02:32:34.518]  But there's no other way to look at it.
[02:32:35.459 --> 02:32:44.205]  I mean, FEMA cutting power, cutting electrical lines, cutting phone lines to police department emergency centers because the sheriffs are trying to help people.
[02:32:44.725 --> 02:32:46.006]  I mean, they do not...
[02:32:46.644 --> 02:32:47.004]  Why?
[02:32:47.384 --> 02:32:49.825]  Those people being taken care of those first four or five days.
[02:32:50.145 --> 02:32:53.347]  They wanted to build up a crisis, but then bring in regular army.
[02:32:55.288 --> 02:32:56.468]  And Bush is a lame duck.
[02:32:56.508 --> 02:33:00.050]  He'll take all the blame and be pilloried for it, and, oh, isn't Bush an idiot?
[02:33:00.390 --> 02:33:01.030]  Ha ha ha.
[02:33:01.290 --> 02:33:07.393]  Meanwhile, the globalists use him as a shield while their whole agenda moves forward.
[02:33:08.533 --> 02:33:12.755]  And a bunch of dumb neocons will all mindlessly defend Bush and the government's response.
[02:33:14.862 --> 02:33:15.584]  Heaven help us.
[02:33:16.285 --> 02:33:17.667]  They've got it figured out.
[02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:20.491]  They're using this.
[02:33:21.773 --> 02:33:23.235]  Notice everything is martial law.
[02:33:23.275 --> 02:33:25.018]  The TV shows, the programs.
[02:33:25.338 --> 02:33:26.600]  It's just everything.
[02:33:27.061 --> 02:33:27.842]  The dramas.
[02:33:27.862 --> 02:33:29.985]  It's just all getting us ready for this.
[02:33:31.934 --> 02:33:37.215]  The most important point is the government had federalized that city.
[02:33:37.315 --> 02:33:41.376]  Remember two and a half years ago I made Police State Three Total Enslavement?
[02:33:41.396 --> 02:33:46.677]  I made a big deal in the film about those articles where it said the city has been federalized.
[02:33:46.877 --> 02:33:49.398]  Every major department.
[02:33:49.798 --> 02:33:53.438]  I've got to Google that and dig that article back out and get an article written about that.
[02:33:53.478 --> 02:33:57.539]  Or maybe you should write an article about it and post it with that article and send it to me and I'll post it.
[02:33:57.879 --> 02:33:59.140]  I can't write all the articles.
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.020]  I can't do it all.
[02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:01.140]  It's just there's too much.
[02:34:01.969 --> 02:34:04.970]  But, I mean, here it is where the feds federalized it.
[02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:10.471]  The feds ran the whole thing, had it stand down, and then tried to blame it on the state and locals.
[02:34:13.472 --> 02:34:16.013]  But out of this still, well, we've just got to have a bigger federal government.
[02:34:16.333 --> 02:34:21.534]  FEMA was cutting the police communication lines and wouldn't let the police bring food and water in.
[02:34:21.774 --> 02:34:23.395]  We need more power for FEMA!
[02:34:23.955 --> 02:34:28.336]  The guy's crying about somebody's mother dying, but we still need more FEMA!
[02:34:28.416 --> 02:34:29.997]  FEMA's evil!
[02:34:30.037 --> 02:34:31.017]  Give them more money!
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.263]  That guy meant well, what he was saying, that mayor.
[02:34:38.725 --> 02:34:39.546]  He meant well.
[02:34:41.287 --> 02:34:45.391]  But at the end of it, barely can croak it out, just get a little more money.
[02:34:49.474 --> 02:34:51.796]  They can't protect you, they won't protect you.
[02:34:51.976 --> 02:34:53.797]  I got a bunch of clips here and a bunch of calls.
[02:34:53.817 --> 02:34:55.659]  I wish it was a five-hour show today.
[02:34:59.031 --> 02:34:59.931]  I will just say this.
[02:34:59.991 --> 02:35:01.252]  I didn't plug it in the first hour.
[02:35:01.272 --> 02:35:02.412]  I didn't plug it in the second hour.
[02:35:02.432 --> 02:35:09.555]  All last week, I hardly talked about my videos one or two times in five days because we've been covering the hurricane.
[02:35:09.575 --> 02:35:17.018]  But sure enough, it's been a good test because if I don't talk about my videos in books, we don't sell any of them.
[02:35:17.718 --> 02:35:26.621]  And I got six employees, not counting myself, and if we don't sell videos, we don't operate.
[02:35:28.448 --> 02:35:31.111]  And, number one, these are great films.
[02:35:31.131 --> 02:35:34.194]  I mean, these are the best videos out there when it comes to exposing the New World Order.
[02:35:34.634 --> 02:35:35.835]  I mean, look at my new film.
[02:35:35.875 --> 02:35:36.496]  What's it called?
[02:35:36.716 --> 02:35:38.298]  Martial Law.
[02:35:38.818 --> 02:35:40.080]  What are you now seeing?
[02:35:42.242 --> 02:35:43.543]  What's my other classic film?
[02:35:43.943 --> 02:35:45.525]  Road to Tyranny.
[02:35:46.542 --> 02:35:49.743]  Police State 3, total enslavement.
[02:35:50.183 --> 02:35:51.863]  Police State 2, the takeover.
[02:35:52.183 --> 02:35:52.724]  Police State 2000.
[02:35:52.924 --> 02:35:54.604]  Take Police State 2000.
[02:35:54.644 --> 02:35:59.305]  I mean, you know why I've been freaking out about troops taking over and martial law and creating crises?
[02:35:59.525 --> 02:36:03.346]  Because, I mean, imagine sitting there and watching Marines train to put you in a camp.
[02:36:04.366 --> 02:36:07.167]  I mean, these videos have got to be seen by people.
[02:36:09.148 --> 02:36:09.608]  Imagine!
[02:36:09.908 --> 02:36:19.112]  Kansas City Firefighter shoots the video of FEMA in a secret meeting, teaching a room full of police and firefighters and sheriff's deputies that all Christians are enemies of the U.S.
[02:36:19.152 --> 02:36:19.512]  government.
[02:36:19.852 --> 02:36:24.254]  I mean, this is like Body Snatcher V, you know, bizarre.
[02:36:24.334 --> 02:36:32.957]  I mean, this is... Imagine if they made a Hollywood movie where it shows the feds in a classroom going, all Christians are enemies of the government.
[02:36:33.437 --> 02:36:34.858]  The Founding Fathers are evil.
[02:36:35.458 --> 02:36:36.958]  But we actually have the video.
[02:36:38.419 --> 02:36:38.679]  It's just...
[02:36:39.983 --> 02:36:41.203]  Folks, this is my life.
[02:36:41.724 --> 02:36:43.064]  I wish this wasn't true.
[02:36:43.204 --> 02:36:45.745]  I wish that... Every day I wish.
[02:36:46.505 --> 02:36:48.686]  My wife's like, we've got to get out of this country.
[02:36:50.527 --> 02:36:51.647]  We've got to get out of here.
[02:36:54.388 --> 02:36:56.189]  And, you know, I've said I'm not going to leave the country.
[02:36:56.249 --> 02:36:58.250]  I've jokingly said I'm going to move to an island.
[02:37:00.431 --> 02:37:03.392]  The Internet story is, I own an island.
[02:37:04.552 --> 02:37:06.073]  The latest thing is, I am a...
[02:37:08.953 --> 02:37:10.374]  Did I come from a circus family?
[02:37:11.815 --> 02:37:13.616]  But I'm a carnival huckster.
[02:37:15.317 --> 02:37:16.818]  I've been to, I think, a circus twice.
[02:37:16.958 --> 02:37:19.360]  When I was like three years old and we had to leave, I cried.
[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:20.781]  I thought the clowns were scary.
[02:37:22.182 --> 02:37:25.004]  No, folks, I'm a Soviet cosmonaut from Pluto.
[02:37:26.164 --> 02:37:27.125]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:37:27.145 --> 02:37:29.026]  I don't know why I'm telling those stories.
[02:37:29.046 --> 02:37:30.267]  Sometimes you've got to laugh, folks.
[02:37:31.448 --> 02:37:35.751]  But regardless, please get martial law.
[02:37:35.851 --> 02:37:36.971]  Get American dictators.
[02:37:37.031 --> 02:37:37.852]  Get road to tyranny.
[02:37:39.065 --> 02:37:39.745]  We've got discounts.
[02:37:39.825 --> 02:37:41.046]  If you get three or more, you save $18.
[02:37:41.586 --> 02:37:45.987]  On some videos, if you buy one video, the next is $5.95.
[02:37:47.308 --> 02:37:50.629]  $5.95 for a two-hour DVD, high-quality production.
[02:37:53.610 --> 02:37:56.291]  You're authorized to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:37:56.611 --> 02:37:59.232]  Here is the toll-free number to order the videos.
[02:37:59.252 --> 02:37:59.292]  1-888-
[02:38:02.892 --> 02:38:07.995]  253-3139, 888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:38:08.055 --> 02:38:08.956]  We're going to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:38:09.296 --> 02:38:15.480]  We're for 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, all 12 of my films, my weekly TV reports, all my best audio interviews.
[02:38:30.003 --> 02:38:30.603]  Just everything.
[02:38:30.643 --> 02:38:31.584]  There's so much there.
[02:38:31.744 --> 02:38:34.285]  E-books, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:38:35.005 --> 02:38:38.987]  Or go to infowars.com to peruse the shopping cart, order any of the videos or books.
[02:38:39.007 --> 02:38:40.067]  We have a whole book store up there.
[02:38:40.427 --> 02:38:41.127]  Please take action.
[02:38:43.168 --> 02:38:44.409]  People wanted me to air this again.
[02:38:45.029 --> 02:38:49.771]  Here's the short promo for Oil Storm, where a hurricane hits the U.S., sinks some ships.
[02:38:50.521 --> 02:38:53.782]  It causes rapid deterioration of society.
[02:38:54.302 --> 02:38:55.302]  Everything falls apart.
[02:38:55.322 --> 02:38:59.644]  There's martial law starting in the Gulf region and martial law nationwide.
[02:38:59.984 --> 02:39:02.004]  But the president saves you with martial law.
[02:39:02.785 --> 02:39:05.045]  Just like they always promo what they're going to do.
[02:39:05.085 --> 02:39:08.887]  I hope it doesn't get this bad, but here's a promo for that.
[02:39:08.907 --> 02:39:10.027]  It has already begun.
[02:39:11.159 --> 02:39:15.042]  Hundreds are feared dead with emergency services unable to call.
[02:39:15.122 --> 02:39:16.103]  A chain of events.
[02:39:16.123 --> 02:39:18.164]  A million barrels of oil gone.
[02:39:18.264 --> 02:39:19.425]  That will spark fear.
[02:39:19.645 --> 02:39:21.206]  A killer blow to the economy.
[02:39:21.246 --> 02:39:26.529]  Create panic and result in a catastrophe that will change our lives forever.
[02:39:26.810 --> 02:39:31.032]  Americans didn't realize how fragile their existence was.
[02:39:31.332 --> 02:39:32.853]  An FX original event.
[02:39:33.334 --> 02:39:34.274]  Sunday, June 5th.
[02:39:35.915 --> 02:39:38.057]  America's lifeline has been severed.
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:42.501]  And the globalists know that to really change societies, they've got to shock you.
[02:39:43.301 --> 02:39:49.042]  Even if you blame the government and hate them, it's that shocking process that gets you out of your norm so they can remold you.
[02:39:49.062 --> 02:39:53.603]  It's like heating up clay to get it soft and then heating it up again to harden it.
[02:39:53.623 --> 02:40:03.065]  In fact, they talk about unfreezing your mental setup, your worldviews, what you'll put up with, molding it the way they want it, and then freezing it again.
[02:40:04.597 --> 02:40:06.780]  The whole educational system is set up to do this.
[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:08.542]  And hey, just give your liberties up, folks.
[02:40:08.562 --> 02:40:09.663]  Your life's only going to get worse.
[02:40:10.184 --> 02:40:12.406]  Notice, the more liberties you give up, the worse it gets.
[02:40:12.426 --> 02:40:13.668]  There's just always something new.
[02:40:14.429 --> 02:40:16.812]  And as you give up more freedom, it's just going to get worse and worse.
[02:40:16.852 --> 02:40:23.359]  You're going to give up more, worse and worse, until we're all microchipped in compact cities like prisoners, wearing uniforms.
[02:40:23.439 --> 02:40:24.721]  Oh, this is the official plan, by the way.
[02:40:25.700 --> 02:40:33.889]  You think movies like The Island and THX 1138, where they got shaved heads and wore little white uniforms, that's actually the plan, folks.
[02:40:33.909 --> 02:40:34.630]  We have the documents.
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:39.204]  And, I mean, that's going to be your children and your grandchildren's lives.
[02:40:39.824 --> 02:40:43.608]  And then they'll just keep exterminating us as they get us into more and more compact cities.
[02:40:44.189 --> 02:40:45.430]  It's just going to get worse and worse.
[02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:46.952]  More and more crises.
[02:40:47.652 --> 02:40:48.613]  Folks, this is official.
[02:40:49.054 --> 02:40:50.595]  I have Henry Kissinger's own documents.
[02:40:50.615 --> 02:40:51.056]  I have it all.
[02:40:51.096 --> 02:40:52.557]  It's all public.
[02:40:52.597 --> 02:40:53.158]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:40:53.178 --> 02:40:54.359]  We're going to kill you idiots.
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:55.941]  You're too dumb to even know it.
[02:40:58.388 --> 02:41:01.169]  So, hey, cops, government people, just go along with it.
[02:41:01.249 --> 02:41:02.329]  Sure, laugh at us.
[02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:03.850]  Laugh at the American people.
[02:41:03.890 --> 02:41:05.190]  Laugh at people like Alex Jones.
[02:41:05.811 --> 02:41:12.533]  Ten years from now, you'll be in a FEMA camp remembering what I said, crying, wishing to God you'd listen.
[02:41:13.233 --> 02:41:20.316]  Or perhaps we can wake up and fight this, and we won't be there in ten years, and then the fools can giggle and say we were wrong.
[02:41:20.876 --> 02:41:24.217]  But unfortunately, I've been right about almost everything in the last ten years, and
[02:41:25.584 --> 02:41:27.666]  It's a pretty tough row we got to hoe.
[02:41:28.126 --> 02:41:31.568]  This next clip is one of the many clips we have of police looting.
[02:41:32.149 --> 02:41:33.910]  They're not looting cheese and water.
[02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:42.936]  They are looting jewelry and $100 tennis shoes and stuff like that in a big Walmart.
[02:41:43.096 --> 02:41:47.819]  So just female cops going around with shopping carts, shopping.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:51.782]  And a new watch, a new fishing rod, a new...
[02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:54.351]  And that's how it always is.
[02:41:54.391 --> 02:41:58.894]  You're always going to have criminal police leading any looting.
[02:41:58.914 --> 02:42:00.455]  That's just history, folks.
[02:42:01.116 --> 02:42:02.737]  The good cops will be off helping people.
[02:42:02.797 --> 02:42:04.218]  The bad ones will be leading the criminals.
[02:42:04.258 --> 02:42:05.459]  That's just how it works.
[02:42:05.519 --> 02:42:06.199]  So here it is.
[02:42:09.731 --> 02:42:11.971]  Well, are you doing it because you need it?
[02:42:12.231 --> 02:42:15.252]  Yeah, I mean, you know, we have no means to wash clothes.
[02:42:15.272 --> 02:42:16.012]  We have no food.
[02:42:16.112 --> 02:42:16.392]  Sure.
[02:42:17.292 --> 02:42:19.553]  A lot of the people here say they don't feel bad taking this stuff.
[02:42:19.653 --> 02:42:20.433]  One, because they need it.
[02:42:20.653 --> 02:42:22.413]  But two, they said the police said it was okay.
[02:42:23.114 --> 02:42:24.394]  And we actually saw the police.
[02:42:25.294 --> 02:42:26.214]  They're a mile free.
[02:42:27.114 --> 02:42:29.135]  Hold on to it.
[02:42:29.395 --> 02:42:30.015]  How you doing?
[02:42:30.135 --> 02:42:31.055]  Hi, what you doing here?
[02:42:31.255 --> 02:42:32.175]  I'm doing my job.
[02:42:32.855 --> 02:42:33.635]  Taking shoes?
[02:42:33.835 --> 02:42:34.916]  No, I'm looking for looters.
[02:42:35.056 --> 02:42:36.396]  Looking for looters?
[02:42:42.364 --> 02:42:43.465]  And what do you do when you find them?
[02:42:44.105 --> 02:42:47.547]  Because I think I've seen them.
[02:42:47.747 --> 02:42:49.528]  They're all around us, though.
[02:42:49.548 --> 02:42:50.289]  That's what I see.
[02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:51.349]  Including you.
[02:42:52.310 --> 02:42:53.891]  I haven't taken anything, ma'am.
[02:42:53.911 --> 02:43:01.615]  They don't quite look your color.
[02:43:02.375 --> 02:43:10.460]  You know, one of the things that strikes you is, of course, a Walmart is a store that everybody knows, and to walk in it and see it as a free-for-all like that is...
[02:43:11.375 --> 02:43:16.858]  Well, you can't help but laugh sometimes, even though it is grossly against the law.
[02:43:17.138 --> 02:43:19.079]  To see the police, though, that was a shock.
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:39.971]  Martin, do you suspect that the police officer that you encountered in there was not making something up out of whole cloth, and that those people were also not making something up out of whole cloth, given what Governor Blanco said, that essentially if it's non-violent, they have other things to worry about than people stealing stuff?
[02:43:43.090 --> 02:43:43.490]  That's true.
[02:43:43.650 --> 02:43:44.691]  They do, obviously.
[02:43:44.791 --> 02:43:52.793]  In a city where the mayor has just proclaimed that he believes there's hundreds, maybe thousands dead, the looting of one Walmart does not rank very high on the Richter scale of problems.
[02:43:53.334 --> 02:44:06.658]  However, when you have the police in there looting, that is a problem, because if the breakdown of law and order happens on the very first day after the hurricane, how far will it go in a couple of days?
[02:44:08.119 --> 02:44:12.460]  We don't want to contemplate that question, and we're sorry that you have to, but where you are, you have to.
[02:44:12.970 --> 02:44:16.612]  All right, so for those that don't know, literally, folks, I've been sent, I don't know how many.
[02:44:18.093 --> 02:44:19.294]  It's got to be like ten clips.
[02:44:19.334 --> 02:44:20.295]  I'm sure you've all seen it.
[02:44:20.775 --> 02:44:22.296]  That was the day after the hurricane.
[02:44:22.937 --> 02:44:24.898]  Okay, and the lights are on.
[02:44:25.739 --> 02:44:29.701]  And there are these police in full uniform looking spiffy.
[02:44:30.602 --> 02:44:38.267]  And remember, over two-thirds walked off the job, leaving the real men, and it was men, folks, male police.
[02:44:38.940 --> 02:44:39.961]  I'm just going to tell you like it is.
[02:44:40.001 --> 02:44:41.742]  The women basically all walked off.
[02:44:42.222 --> 02:44:43.322]  That's just the facts.
[02:44:43.382 --> 02:44:44.523]  I'm sorry I have to report it to you.
[02:44:45.363 --> 02:44:46.564]  It was the real men.
[02:44:46.624 --> 02:44:48.045]  A couple hundred of them left.
[02:44:48.485 --> 02:44:51.527]  Literally like six cops at the Superdome trying to control things.
[02:44:52.227 --> 02:44:53.968]  And they had nothing and their homes were destroyed.
[02:44:54.308 --> 02:44:55.169]  And they're begging for help.
[02:44:55.449 --> 02:44:57.630]  And then you've got the other police.
[02:44:58.450 --> 02:45:07.295]  Just these big, fat, corrupt police just going around with their... Some police had to kick down doors and get food and stuff at convenience stores.
[02:45:07.335 --> 02:45:08.336]  That's totally different.
[02:45:08.716 --> 02:45:20.163]  I mean, cops just loading watches and phones and Nintendos and, you know, just big, fat, decadent cops running around day one!
[02:45:21.024 --> 02:45:22.144]  Day one!
[02:45:24.686 --> 02:45:27.127]  And the feds doing absolutely nothing either.
[02:45:27.167 --> 02:45:28.048]  They were in total control.
[02:45:30.382 --> 02:45:32.984]  The only totally federalized city other than D.C.
[02:45:34.425 --> 02:45:36.206]  They totally ran the entire operation.
[02:45:37.247 --> 02:45:40.149]  Now here's the ridiculous statement that Bush doesn't like black people.
[02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:41.770]  Bush doesn't like people, period.
[02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:42.791]  He's a devil worshiper.
[02:45:43.071 --> 02:45:44.292]  But here's this ridiculous statement.
[02:45:44.332 --> 02:45:44.632]  Here it is.
[02:45:45.472 --> 02:45:46.853]  They betray us in the media.
[02:45:46.893 --> 02:45:50.236]  If you see a black family, it says they're looting.
[02:45:50.256 --> 02:45:53.798]  If you see a white family, it says they're looking for food.
[02:45:54.158 --> 02:45:59.462]  And you know it's been five days because most of the people are black people.
[02:46:01.385 --> 02:46:06.968]  Complain about I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch.
[02:46:07.248 --> 02:46:10.829]  I've even been shopping before even giving a donation.
[02:46:11.029 --> 02:46:16.012]  So now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give.
[02:46:16.652 --> 02:46:21.954]  And just to imagine if I was down there and those are my people down there.
[02:46:21.974 --> 02:46:27.297]  So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with the setup, the way America is set up to help.
[02:46:28.977 --> 02:46:34.259]  The poor, the black people, let's well off as slow as possible.
[02:46:34.619 --> 02:46:37.160]  I mean, Red Cross is doing everything they can.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:39.941]  We already realized a lot of the people that could help.
[02:46:40.141 --> 02:46:48.903]  And that's the rapper responding to his earlier comments on the NBC Moneython to give the Red Cross that 10% might go to the people with strings attached.
[02:46:49.183 --> 02:46:50.304]  Criminal organization.
[02:46:51.284 --> 02:46:55.165]  And he said, George Bush doesn't like black people.
[02:46:58.092 --> 02:47:05.654]  Look, obviously the media trying to be sensational, show people looting food and stuff, which there's nothing wrong with that, and then try to call them all looters.
[02:47:06.554 --> 02:47:10.935]  And they were predominantly black, because that's the predominant poor population.
[02:47:11.355 --> 02:47:14.876]  I mean, the city of New Orleans is mainly black anyway, so the main poor are going to be black.
[02:47:15.836 --> 02:47:21.797]  And obviously, that's a bunch of demonization going on.
[02:47:22.990 --> 02:47:25.791]  But it doesn't help to have Jesse Jackson attacking Bush and others.
[02:47:25.811 --> 02:47:31.474]  That only makes Bush look good, because it's so stupid to say it's because they're black they didn't do anything.
[02:47:31.954 --> 02:47:38.077]  No, it's because the government wants to make people look stupid, period, and come in with martial laws why this happened.
[02:47:39.258 --> 02:47:45.521]  And so again, Jesse Jackson creating the false left-right paradigm, coming in with others to Bush's aid.
[02:47:45.781 --> 02:47:49.123]  By the way, I saw Pumpkinhead, whatever her name is, the new head of the Red Cross,
[02:47:50.018 --> 02:48:01.921]  Up on, two nights ago, Saturday night with Matt Lauer, and they cut to her, and Matt Lauer goes, by the way, a lot of people are calling saying, how do they know that the money all goes to the flood victims?
[02:48:03.101 --> 02:48:05.242]  And, you know, will you reassure them?
[02:48:05.322 --> 02:48:07.502]  And she just said, we just love the victims.
[02:48:08.183 --> 02:48:09.223]  We just love them.
[02:48:09.503 --> 02:48:12.444]  She wouldn't even say they're going to give them all the money, because they don't.
[02:48:12.524 --> 02:48:13.324]  Look, let me explain something.
[02:48:13.962 --> 02:48:16.044]  The thousands of Red Cross volunteers are great.
[02:48:16.524 --> 02:48:19.286]  The organization isn't just evil.
[02:48:19.386 --> 02:48:20.126]  It's criminal.
[02:48:20.627 --> 02:48:23.849]  We have a giant article where they steal the mail.
[02:48:24.449 --> 02:48:26.111]  They charge the victims money.
[02:48:26.511 --> 02:48:27.492]  They're criminal.
[02:48:28.052 --> 02:48:30.814]  Why do you think the mainstream media only promotes them?
[02:48:31.614 --> 02:48:32.615]  Shouldn't that wake you up?
[02:48:34.276 --> 02:48:34.937]  It's unbelievable.
[02:48:34.997 --> 02:48:36.938]  Do not give anything to the Red Cross.
[02:48:37.599 --> 02:48:39.120]  Nothing to those scumbags.
[02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:40.120]  We're right back.
[02:48:45.811 --> 02:48:52.695]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:48:52.955 --> 02:48:54.356]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.536 --> 02:48:56.737]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.897 --> 02:48:58.978]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.258 --> 02:49:04.201]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.521 --> 02:49:08.543]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.803 --> 02:49:10.584]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.664 --> 02:49:21.307]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.447 --> 02:49:23.347]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.547 --> 02:49:27.429]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[02:51:46.708 --> 02:51:51.850]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.530 --> 02:51:54.892]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.392 --> 02:52:05.637]  The most preposterous thing is Bush and Rice and others all cutting their vacations short three days into the disaster, well, her four days in, when she was booed out of a theater.
[02:52:06.037 --> 02:52:08.618]  It was that obvious to them how grotesque it was.
[02:52:10.099 --> 02:52:10.279]  But...
[02:52:11.698 --> 02:52:17.422]  Now Bush running around going, we never thought, we never heard, we never imagined that a flood like this could happen.
[02:52:17.442 --> 02:52:19.444]  I mean, the level of lying.
[02:52:21.125 --> 02:52:22.906]  I'm just sick of them lying to us.
[02:52:24.227 --> 02:52:27.730]  Let's go ahead and this is kind of radio graffiti.
[02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:29.371]  I'm giving everybody about 30, 40 seconds.
[02:52:30.131 --> 02:52:31.352]  Let's go to John in Tennessee.
[02:52:31.392 --> 02:52:32.013]  John, go ahead.
[02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:36.023]  The Herald Sun of Australia is reporting that AP and U.S.
[02:52:36.083 --> 02:52:42.448]  Army Corps of Engineers say that the New Orleans police shot and killed five contractors of the Corps of Engineers.
[02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:44.349]  And it wasn't snipers.
[02:52:44.409 --> 02:52:45.871]  It was some kind of friendly fire.
[02:52:46.771 --> 02:52:48.953]  Unless, of course, they were provocateurs.
[02:52:49.433 --> 02:52:50.054]  Do me a favor.
[02:52:50.154 --> 02:52:51.735]  Email that to tipsandinfowars.com.
[02:52:51.855 --> 02:52:52.496]  I'll get it posted.
[02:52:52.876 --> 02:52:53.276]  Okay.
[02:52:53.597 --> 02:53:01.623]  And MSNBC has reported just now that the Corps of Engineers is opening new breaches in the levees.
[02:53:02.608 --> 02:53:04.968]  Supposedly to let the city drain faster.
[02:53:05.829 --> 02:53:07.349]  So they're not fixing anything.
[02:53:07.449 --> 02:53:08.669]  They're opening the levees.
[02:53:09.329 --> 02:53:15.951]  What you see on TV, they're fixing... No, I saw that this morning, which they're the engineers, but I mean, give me a break.
[02:53:16.231 --> 02:53:18.231]  Another hurricane or storm could hit.
[02:53:18.431 --> 02:53:20.372]  They've got to get those things breached and pump it.
[02:53:20.912 --> 02:53:26.953]  And MSNBC has the video downloads of Aaron Brouchard crying, and he also said, quote,
[02:53:27.489 --> 02:53:31.812]  Bureaucracy committed murder in New Orleans, and bureaucracy has to stand trial.
[02:53:31.992 --> 02:53:32.953]  Well, send it all to me.
[02:53:32.993 --> 02:53:34.174]  Thank you for the call.
[02:53:34.474 --> 02:53:35.295]  Great points, John.
[02:53:35.415 --> 02:53:36.596]  Rick and Reno, you're on the air.
[02:53:36.636 --> 02:53:37.136]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:53:37.717 --> 02:53:38.477]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:53:38.537 --> 02:53:40.779]  Hey, I have a website.
[02:53:40.939 --> 02:53:42.180]  It's 9-11 Roundtable.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:48.765]  I'm organizing caravans to Crawford, and I'm organizing caravans to the Gulf Coast to help out.
[02:53:49.165 --> 02:53:49.525]  Thank you.
[02:53:49.545 --> 02:53:51.487]  Well, the FEMA bastards won't let you through.
[02:53:52.890 --> 02:53:53.711]  Thank you for the call.
[02:53:53.751 --> 02:53:56.933]  I mean, they won't let the Coast Guard through with the fuel.
[02:53:56.953 --> 02:53:58.193]  They wouldn't let sheriffs through.
[02:53:58.213 --> 02:54:02.816]  And when the sheriffs were still communicating, they went and cut their emergency management lines.
[02:54:03.397 --> 02:54:04.017]  You understand?
[02:54:04.437 --> 02:54:07.299]  Cutting lines so the cops can't help the people.
[02:54:07.599 --> 02:54:08.980]  They engineered this.
[02:54:10.541 --> 02:54:12.022]  Bill in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:54:12.062 --> 02:54:12.563]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:54:12.963 --> 02:54:19.387]  Alex, this is where the sheriffs should have used their authority and arrested all of those damn FEMA people.
[02:54:20.057 --> 02:54:21.557]  And put them in block up.
[02:54:21.877 --> 02:54:22.558]  They are criminals.
[02:54:22.618 --> 02:54:24.238]  FEMA always does stuff like this.
[02:54:25.058 --> 02:54:25.398]  They are.
[02:54:25.578 --> 02:54:26.818]  They should have used their authority.
[02:54:26.858 --> 02:54:27.398]  They have it.
[02:54:27.759 --> 02:54:28.959]  They are the authority here.
[02:54:29.199 --> 02:54:33.660]  They might not get away with it in Washington, D.C., but they can damn sure get away with it out in the states.
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:39.321]  Well, the minute the feds have been stood up to many times by sheriffs, and the feds always back off.
[02:54:40.641 --> 02:54:44.582]  Because the sheriff standing up against these people is just standing on solid ground.
[02:54:44.802 --> 02:54:45.002]  Right.
[02:54:46.112 --> 02:54:46.272]  Right.
[02:54:46.392 --> 02:54:46.892]  I'll get off.
[02:54:47.453 --> 02:54:47.933]  Anything else?
[02:54:48.233 --> 02:54:48.873]  No, that's it.
[02:54:48.953 --> 02:54:49.094]  Bye.
[02:54:49.414 --> 02:54:49.774]  All right.
[02:54:50.014 --> 02:54:50.794]  Who's up next here?
[02:54:50.814 --> 02:54:52.015]  I know some of the callers changed.
[02:54:54.496 --> 02:55:00.519]  Okay, well, we had a whole bunch of phones loaded, and everybody hung up right at once thinking the show was over, so no more calls.
[02:55:00.879 --> 02:55:06.842]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, back tomorrow, 11 to 2, live.
[02:55:06.882 --> 02:55:10.184]  And, yes, this was a live broadcast here on this Labor Day.
[02:55:11.631 --> 02:55:15.993]  And when you're out eating hamburgers and hot dogs with your family today, just remember what America's all about.
[02:55:16.253 --> 02:55:28.198]  Not trusting the government, having local control, being individualistic, being rugged, not being a bunch of world government-worshipping, Bush-worshipping, FEMA-worshipping idiots.
[02:55:29.258 --> 02:55:36.581]  And it's just horrible what's happened, and it's having major economic impact on the U.S.
[02:55:36.841 --> 02:55:38.662]  We've got refugees all over Austin.
[02:55:39.679 --> 02:55:41.241]  I mean, they're just all over the place.
[02:55:41.282 --> 02:55:41.862]  I mean, I go in.
[02:55:42.223 --> 02:55:43.305]  Walgreens, they're there.
[02:55:43.425 --> 02:55:44.386]  Buses everywhere.
[02:55:45.528 --> 02:55:46.069]  More of them.
[02:55:46.149 --> 02:55:47.511]  Thousands and thousands coming.
[02:55:47.551 --> 02:55:51.497]  I mean, I'm 11 hours away from New Orleans.
[02:55:52.038 --> 02:55:53.861]  So it's massive, folks.
[02:55:54.918 --> 02:55:56.559]  It's a huge effect of what's happened.
