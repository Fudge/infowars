[00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:06.207]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:07.909]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.750]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.230]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:12.831]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:17.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:21.857]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:23.958]  Music
[00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:40.556]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:42.758]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:47.642]  It is Thursday, the fifth day of May 2005.
[00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:52.266]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:54.908]  So I guess it's 5-5-5.
[00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:56.589]  Interesting date.
[00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.732]  The fifth year, the fifth month, the fifth day.
[00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:03.435]  I bet the globalists, with their obsession with numerology...
[00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:11.416]  If I was a betting man, they're going to pull something off next year on 6-6-6.
[00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:20.640]  We did predict they'd do something on 3-11, 911 days after 9-11.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.001]  And lo and behold, that did take place.
[00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:31.644]  And when it even came out in the mainstream Spanish news, clear evidence the government, as usual, was behind it.
[00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:32.624]  But I digress.
[00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:41.106]  Two Granados, or grenades, explode at British Consulate in New York City.
[00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:46.090]  Two small makeshift grenades exploded outside a building.
[00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:48.812]  Makeshift grenades.
[00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:50.033]  They just used the term.
[00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:51.674]  Well, that's not a grenade then.
[00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:56.097]  It's an improvised explosive.
[00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:07.965]  Two small makeshift grenades exploded outside a building housing the British consulate early Thursday, election day in England, causing slight damage but injuring no one, officials said.
[00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:11.888]  And of course, we've caught the British government involved in many terror attacks against themselves.
[00:02:12.468 --> 00:02:16.492]  Their own MI5 agents like David Shiler have gone public and exposed it.
[00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:22.937]  And when Bush was over there speaking a few years ago on the eve of the Iraq war, trying to legitimize...
[00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:29.706]  The fight against terrorism, of course, there were bombings of embassies, and that led back to the British government again.
[00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:31.368]  We have official U.S.
[00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:35.992]  and British plans, like Gladio, to carry out terror attacks and blame it on their enemies.
[00:02:36.432 --> 00:02:37.333]  So I'll be getting into that.
[00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:42.277]  Russian pilots to make rain stay away at military parade in Australia.
[00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:44.379]  This from ABC News.
[00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:45.400]  Weather control.
[00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:50.103]  Associated Press, more on this nightmare.
[00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:54.245]  Government researchers tested AIDS drugs on foster children.
[00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:58.967]  Experimental, highly toxic drugs, including children that didn't even have HIV.
[00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:03.629]  Italian website banned over Nazi Pope picture.
[00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.172]  And this is an international website based in Brazil, but Italy's trying to order Brazil to take it down.
[00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:13.973]  And if they can order them to do that, they can order anybody to do it.
[00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:15.874]  Massive attack on free speech.
[00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:16.094]  And see,
[00:03:16.952 --> 00:03:18.494]  That's what censorship is.
[00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:23.600]  Censorship isn't the newspaper carrying your letter to the editor.
[00:03:26.023 --> 00:03:32.871]  Censorship isn't... Well, this broadcast, I'm not going to have the Moonies on promoting their religion.
[00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:35.995]  Censorship is where you go out...
[00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:49.113]  To someone's source material and you try to order them to stop distributing or to go to somebody with a sandwich board on the side of the street corner saying the end is near and telling them they can't do that.
[00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:50.514]  That is censorship.
[00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:54.315]  And this is clear, dangerous thought crime censorship.
[00:03:57.497 --> 00:04:01.318]  And coming up, we're going to be talking to Charles Shaw, a great researcher.
[00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:11.225]  About his detailed two-part series, the second part of the series just came out, regulated resistance to the gatekeepers of the so-called left.
[00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:14.426]  Of course, I've been exposing the gatekeepers on the left and the right.
[00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:20.229]  There is no left and right when you get down to reality, but only in the false perceptions that have been created in our minds.
[00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:26.472]  Vanity Fair is set to publish an expose on Jeff Gannon, the lover boy of Republican leaders.
[00:04:28.212 --> 00:04:29.593]  The Washington Post is reporting...
[00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:32.386]  Bring me the head of Bin Laden!
[00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:35.488]  That's what the CIA supposedly said the days before 9-11.
[00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:36.889]  Total propaganda.
[00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:40.291]  I begin to ax 13,000 jobs worldwide.
[00:04:43.072 --> 00:04:50.517]  Oh, there is so much that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen, and your phone calls today on this Thursday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.838]  Websites are Infowars.com and Infowars.net.
[00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:53.418]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.643]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:05.906]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:09.910]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.234]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:18.338]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:20.280]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:23.142 --> 00:05:28.505]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.747]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:34.809]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:41.393]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.756]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:06:00.623 --> 00:06:03.504]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.724]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:06.964 --> 00:06:13.166]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:20.847]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:25.108]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:30.930]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:44.234]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:06.410]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.651]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:08.632]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:11.594]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:11.774 --> 00:07:16.658]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.020]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.022]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:25.126]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:25.446]  Look.
[00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.889]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.855]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:36.239]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:41.785]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:42.646]  Try Nobio.
[00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:43.748]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.792]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goal's a long way.
[00:07:47.972 --> 00:07:50.854]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:53.537]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:56.940]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.762]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:05.908]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:08.551]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:17.225]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:20.806]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 p.m.
[00:08:20.846 --> 00:08:25.167]  Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:27.148 --> 00:08:30.168]  We have got a great guest coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:32.689]  Very impressive research.
[00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:36.047]  And we'll be talking to Charles Shaw.
[00:08:36.527 --> 00:08:41.531]  Regulated Resistance Part 2, his new report, The Gatekeepers of the So-Called Left.
[00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:42.532]  We'll go over Part 1 and 2.
[00:08:43.152 --> 00:08:56.744]  Something we're well aware of here, but he's done a good job chronicling it and putting it together in this two-part series that I'm told is going to be even more expansive, but it's quite detailed.
[00:08:57.584 --> 00:09:01.828]  The big foundations, Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller Brothers, Le Pew...
[00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:09.486]  Annenberg, CPB, and countless others fund the false left.
[00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:14.048]  And that's why you have a controlled left movement in this country.
[00:09:14.128 --> 00:09:18.530]  And they also control many of the phony right-wing neocon groups.
[00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:24.213]  And there's also another class of foundations and corporations that fund the neocons.
[00:09:25.554 --> 00:09:28.015]  So we'll be talking about influence, peddling, and control.
[00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.017]  And these individuals have flooded the web...
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:41.648]  But their disinformation and their telltale sign of infighting and at the same time trying to basically limit the scope of investigations.
[00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:46.672]  And we steer clear of these individuals.
[00:09:46.812 --> 00:10:00.003]  We occasionally have some of them on as a piece to basically be examined and dissected for your educational horror because it is scary.
[00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:04.109]  But that is coming up in 50 minutes.
[00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:14.339]  Major WTC insurance company questions Building 7 collapse as potential fraud.
[00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:19.985]  Also, government researchers tested AIDS on foster children.
[00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:24.189]  Again, this is out of the Associated Press and Reuters.
[00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:26.881]  More and more of this continues to come out.
[00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:28.162]  We'll be covering it.
[00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:38.451]  Obviously, you've heard about the two grenades that exploded at a British consulate in New York City today.
[00:10:39.012 --> 00:10:50.602]  The two small makeshift grenades exploded outside a building housing the British consulate early Thursday, Election Day in England.
[00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:55.419]  Causing slight damage but injuring no one, officials said.
[00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:58.822]  The blast happened at 3.35 a.m.
[00:10:59.682 --> 00:11:09.610]  The grenades had been placed inside a cement flower box outside the front door of the Midtown Manhattan building, police spokesman Noel Waters said.
[00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:14.288]  We do not at this point have any idea who did it or a motive.
[00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:20.152]  Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the consulate is on the 9th and 10th floors of the building.
[00:11:20.172 --> 00:11:24.335]  The mayor said he said he expected it would be open for business later in the day.
[00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:29.858]  After piecing together the shrapnel, police determined the devices were toy grenades.
[00:11:30.859 --> 00:11:34.761]  Toy grenades that had been filled with gunpowder.
[00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:40.045]  Officers estimated that one was the size of a pineapple, the other was the size of a lemon.
[00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:42.312]  No timing device was used.
[00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:52.241]  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the blast shattered a panel of glass in the building's front door and ripped a one-foot chunk from the planter.
[00:11:53.242 --> 00:11:57.346]  Now, folks, you can get inside one of those planters and punch it and it'll break.
[00:11:57.386 --> 00:12:01.009]  The department's bomb squad was at the scene and streets were closed in the area.
[00:12:01.892 --> 00:12:08.775]  Offices of other foreign diplomatic representatives were checked as a precaution and nothing was found, Kelly said.
[00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:12.237]  Security videos in the area were being reviewed, he said.
[00:12:12.717 --> 00:12:17.999]  In London, Britain's Foreign Office said there was no provisions for Britons to vote at overseas consulates.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.381]  No further information was immediately available, the spokesman said.
[00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:28.084]  Calls to the British Embassy in Washington went unanswered early Thursday morning.
[00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:30.586]  6, 7 in the morning, this goes off.
[00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:34.170]  That's about noon over in England, right when they're going to the polls.
[00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.592]  Oh, Tony Blair's right.
[00:12:35.932 --> 00:12:42.640]  We better vote for his administration, because he'll keep us safe from Al-Ciada that is attacking us.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.363]  All right, let's just go over this.
[00:12:45.443 --> 00:12:49.207]  Number one, who has a motive to set off one of these Tinker Toy bombs?
[00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:50.108]  The British government.
[00:12:51.463 --> 00:12:55.285]  And in fact, graphs have been put together and created in England and the U.S.
[00:12:55.325 --> 00:13:06.710]  of every time a scandal comes out exposing one of these administrations, these neocon administrations, a bomb goes off, or the government issues a terror alert, or they catch some group with Ryerson.
[00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:17.515]  Months later it comes out they didn't have Ryerson, it was totally made up, and the government releases the so-called Muslims, who it turns out are on the payroll of MI5 or MI6, living in government safe houses.
[00:13:18.136 --> 00:13:18.916]  It's staged.
[00:13:19.747 --> 00:13:23.630]  We have giant sections on PrisonPlanet.com covering this.
[00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:33.978]  David Shiler, a high-level MI5 agent, quit a few years ago and went public and was arrested over it for giving out state secrets.
[00:13:34.634 --> 00:14:01.446]  When he exposed that it was MI5 that had carried out almost every bombing in the last 25 years in England and Northern Ireland, and that this started with Margaret Thatcher's first year in office, a program that was already existing, was expanded, and that the Omaha bombing and many others that killed hundreds, school buses, bars, churches, were the British government.
[00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.627]  This is mainstream news.
[00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:07.450]  BBC, London Telegraph, the documents have been released.
[00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:10.613]  They were carrying out the bombings.
[00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.095]  Because they have the motive.
[00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:20.600]  To put up cameras, to have control, to have checkpoints, to crack down on the Catholics in Ireland.
[00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:25.204]  And again, folks, don't think of this whether you're a Catholic or a Protestant.
[00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:26.024]  Just look at the facts.
[00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:28.526]  It's a pretext for control.
[00:14:28.546 --> 00:14:29.367]  Okay?
[00:14:29.387 --> 00:14:29.607]  Okay?
[00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:32.488]  And this is how they operate.
[00:14:32.568 --> 00:14:44.157]  I mean, why would the IRA want to bomb anything when a peaceful program would be able to result in Ireland getting its sovereignty back purely?
[00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:46.159]  Why would they do this?
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.325]  Why would the Muslims hijack jets and fly them into buildings knowing it would bring down the wrath of the NWO?
[00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:59.530]  Why would the Chechnyans bomb apartment buildings in Russia knowing it would bring down the wrath of the Russian people?
[00:15:00.345 --> 00:15:04.669]  Well, the head of the Chechnyans, after the bombing, said, we're not doing it, why would we do it?
[00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.193]  And then a missile tracked in on his satellite cell phone and killed him.
[00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:24.009]  And then Russian police, tired of their family members being killed in Moscow, staked out all the apartments and caught three members of FSB, Federal Security Bureau, the new KGB in 1999, planting hexogen bombs on the columns.
[00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:25.302]  They caught them.
[00:15:25.843 --> 00:15:28.384]  Putin announced as Vice President, oh, it was just a drill.
[00:15:28.744 --> 00:15:31.365]  But then the Moscow police tested the hexogen.
[00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:32.026]  It was real.
[00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:37.568]  And then Putin had the police stations raided, the police arrested, and his criminals released.
[00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:40.710]  Time and time again.
[00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:47.653]  Since then, FSB members, including a captain, have quit, gone public, and run to England and said, yes, we were bombing the people.
[00:15:48.474 --> 00:15:48.994]  Of course!
[00:15:49.725 --> 00:16:03.919]  And Putin rode into a vast election victory, set up a total police state, created regional governors, put red stars and sickles and hammers back on the tanks, and started arresting everyone that disagreed with him.
[00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:06.361]  Again, it's just common sense.
[00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:07.782]  Who stands to gain from this?
[00:16:07.862 --> 00:16:10.445]  Why did Hitler blow up his own Reichstag?
[00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:11.506]  Why did he firebomb it?
[00:16:11.526 --> 00:16:12.607]  Their own documents show.
[00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:14.909]  They blame it on their enemies and start arresting people.
[00:16:16.896 --> 00:16:18.977]  In Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[00:16:18.997 --> 00:16:30.662]  government plan, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Ella Lemonser, says, we can blow up a ship in Havana Harbor again, like we did with the Maine in 1898.
[00:16:31.362 --> 00:16:35.004]  We can hijack jets and crash them, preferably with a list of young people on board.
[00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:38.965]  Young people causes an even greater wave of national indignation.
[00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:40.826]  That's a quote, by the way.
[00:16:42.907 --> 00:16:43.387]  Unbelievable.
[00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:47.915]  They said that we can bomb D.C.
[00:16:47.955 --> 00:16:49.956]  with pipe bombs and blame it on enemies.
[00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:51.897]  We can even grab patsies and frame them.
[00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.558]  We can commit sniper attacks.
[00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.219]  We can attack foreign U.S.
[00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:57.960]  military bases with our troops dressed up like foreign enemies.
[00:16:58.561 --> 00:17:00.362]  We can kill our own troops.
[00:17:00.502 --> 00:17:03.863]  I mean, this is an official plan that they wanted to carry out.
[00:17:03.943 --> 00:17:04.824]  Not a war game.
[00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:07.785]  An official plan they wanted to execute.
[00:17:09.726 --> 00:17:11.647]  And so who stands to gain?
[00:17:11.687 --> 00:17:12.548]  Who has a motive?
[00:17:13.527 --> 00:17:22.098]  If the New York police weren't CIA, and we know their leaders are, and if they had two brain cells to rub together, they would know who has the motive.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.268]  These attacks on the existing governments bolster them, strengthen them.
[00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:35.304]  They have Operation Gladio carried out from 1969 to 1979.
[00:17:35.484 --> 00:17:41.147]  Over 125 bombings in Europe, predominantly Germany, France, and Italy.
[00:17:41.748 --> 00:17:43.008]  Italy was the main area.
[00:17:43.769 --> 00:17:44.689]  And the U.S.
[00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:47.311]  government, it's now declassified, absolutely public.
[00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:50.052]  The former head of Italian security forces has gone public.
[00:17:50.613 --> 00:17:53.414]  Bombing, particularly school buses.
[00:17:53.434 --> 00:17:59.718]  There's nothing like blowing up a school bus full of kids and blaming it on the leftists, who they didn't want to be in power.
[00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:04.615]  Now, I'm no fan of the leftists, but the facts are the facts.
[00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:06.656]  And they weren't the ones doing it.
[00:18:08.857 --> 00:18:11.938]  We have the field manuals, we have the documents, it's public.
[00:18:13.098 --> 00:18:29.464]  And before 9-11, we had hundreds of federal courthouses and city-county courthouses having white packages of powder being dropped off in secure floors that didn't even come in by the mail, that had anthrax written on the label to create fear.
[00:18:30.894 --> 00:18:32.175]  And that led back to the U.S.
[00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:32.575]  government.
[00:18:32.856 --> 00:18:37.199]  All of this fear feeds into control, feeds into their pretext.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.623]  And they may find some drooling idiot to blame this on.
[00:18:41.983 --> 00:18:43.384]  It might be some mental patient.
[00:18:43.424 --> 00:18:45.726]  It might be some young provocateur idiot.
[00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:58.577]  But chances are the British government had one of their officers walk up and blow up this flower pot with these Tinker Toy bombs, and it gets them the news coverage they need.
[00:19:00.692 --> 00:19:02.273]  And I just want to thank Tony Blair.
[00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:03.214]  I mean, I know they did it.
[00:19:03.654 --> 00:19:06.175]  I just want to thank Tony Blair for not blowing up something real.
[00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:12.780]  And, you know, you really got to be thankful they're just doing fake terror alerts.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.943]  But same thing yet again.
[00:19:18.603 --> 00:19:19.564]  Grab the headlines.
[00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:29.932]  Every time it comes out about scams or corruption or Enron fraud or Halliburton fraud or gay prostitutes in the White House, there's another terror alert here.
[00:19:30.672 --> 00:19:37.735]  The White House memos got released two years ago and it came out in a White House press conference and Ari Fleischer had to admit, okay, we do this for political gain.
[00:19:37.755 --> 00:19:38.455]  What do you think it's for?
[00:19:40.776 --> 00:19:41.676]  That's Associated Press.
[00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:46.198]  So, just know what this is all about.
[00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:48.799]  And remember, the borders are wide open.
[00:19:49.582 --> 00:19:51.065]  None of this has to do with terrorism.
[00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:52.708]  It's about terrorizing you.
[00:19:52.728 --> 00:19:55.512]  Alright, more news coming up after this quick break.
[00:19:55.532 --> 00:19:56.594]  There is so much news.
[00:19:57.035 --> 00:19:57.536]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.682]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:05.262]  Why?
[00:20:05.282 --> 00:20:08.223]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:21:01.084 --> 00:21:04.565]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[00:21:59.887 --> 00:22:00.308]  Gold.

[00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:08.296]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:08.496 --> 00:22:12.300]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:12.661 --> 00:22:14.562]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:14.603 --> 00:22:16.905]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:22.671]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[00:22:22.671 --> 00:22:23.272]  We're good to go.
[00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.513]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:01.621]  All water isn't the same.
[00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:06.887]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:23:07.147 --> 00:23:09.750]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:18.501]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:27.304]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:49.069]  You may wonder why the Democrats are so controlled, why they go along with open borders, gun control, why they support Bush's phony war, why basically across the board they voted for the Patriot Act, in some instances for police state legislation in greater numbers than the Republicans, because they're owned by major tax-free foundations that put out the policy reports pushing war.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.661]  Pushing global domination.
[00:24:53.062 --> 00:24:58.384]  And the gentleman who's done a lot of wonderful research on this will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:24:58.465 --> 00:25:02.167]  Coming up in the next second, we'll be taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:08.870]  I want to get into just a plethora of news right now.
[00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:12.252]  This is from PR Web, PR Newswire.
[00:25:14.493 --> 00:25:17.275]  And basically, when you have a...
[00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:29.519]  Insurance claim, a large insurance claim, shareholders in those companies are allowed to challenge any insurance fraud in court.
[00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:32.762]  And now that's happening.
[00:25:33.222 --> 00:25:40.509]  Larry Silverstein, his first investment was $120 million, the next was another $100 million, a couple hundred million dollars.
[00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.092]  He'd always owned Building 7 since it had been built in the 70s.
[00:25:45.518 --> 00:25:51.822]  But two months before 9-11, he bought from the Port Authority that was predominantly owned by the Rockefeller Brothers group.
[00:25:52.642 --> 00:25:57.265]  He bought it for literally pennies on the dollar with a down payment of just a few hundred billion dollars.
[00:25:57.705 --> 00:26:06.891]  He bought the entire multi-billion dollar complex and took out record gigantic multiple insurance policies totaling $3.5 billion.
[00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:08.552]  $3.5 billion.
[00:26:08.752 --> 00:26:12.014]  That wasn't enough for him.
[00:26:12.074 --> 00:26:15.056]  He wanted to say that the two planes crashing were two separate events.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.680]  I mean, you talk about open greed, folks.
[00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:24.421]  But again, the insurance companies are predominantly owned by the globalists, so it's kind of the quiet payoff.
[00:26:24.842 --> 00:26:25.882]  They were going along with this.
[00:26:25.942 --> 00:26:31.723]  And he got ruled two events, and the insurance companies didn't really fight it.
[00:26:32.183 --> 00:26:35.964]  So we're talking about 7 billion, it was 7.1 smackers.
[00:26:35.984 --> 00:26:36.484]  7 billion, 100 million.
[00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:55.556]  $7,100,000,000.
[00:26:51.074 --> 00:26:55.556]  But one of the $3.5 billion settlements is being challenged.
[00:26:57.217 --> 00:27:15.025]  A proposal by a small shareholder to withhold approval from the Board of Directors for failure to investigate signs of insurance fraud on 9-11 has been published on the website of Allison, or Allen's Group, one of the world's largest insurers in preparation for its May 4th annual meeting.
[00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:29.118]  PR Newswire reports Allen's Group published a shareholder proposal on April 20th faulting management for ignoring signs of insurance fraud on 9-11-2001.
[00:27:29.678 --> 00:27:42.790]  Allen's carried a significant portion of the insurance coverage on the WTC and stands to pay a corresponding portion of one of the $3.5 billion payouts currently being litigated in New York.
[00:27:43.742 --> 00:27:45.543]  And Silverstein's won his appeal.
[00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:54.089]  In his proposal, shareholder John Leonard, a California native and publisher of books on 9-11, pointed to reports that Building 7 apparently collapsed by demolition.
[00:27:54.349 --> 00:27:55.450]  Well, the owner says he blew it up.
[00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:03.455]  And for no plausible reason related to the 9-11 attacks, management replied that it relied on official U.S.
[00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:06.397]  government reports, which made no mention of such evidence.
[00:28:07.677 --> 00:28:08.418]  The Allens Group...
[00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:15.651]  It's incorporated in Deutschland and has approximately 570,000 shareholders under German stock company law.
[00:28:16.191 --> 00:28:21.536]  Publicly held companies are required to publish shareholder proposals that meet certain criteria.
[00:28:21.556 --> 00:28:33.105]  The text of the shareholder proposal, which may also be viewed at the Allens Group website, allenzgroup.com, is reported below.
[00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:34.185]  It's on prisonplanet.com.
[00:28:38.104 --> 00:28:44.870]  So, all is not happy and cheery in New World Order Wonderland.
[00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.894]  The globalists are not faring too well.
[00:28:48.954 --> 00:28:50.515]  I mean, just more and more of this comes out.
[00:28:50.535 --> 00:28:52.937]  I mean, they blew the building up.
[00:28:52.977 --> 00:29:02.946]  It had two little fires in it, and suddenly the central column collapses, and the whole thing falls in on itself, which takes absolute expert demolition experts over two weeks to set up.
[00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:09.304]  I mean, that sucker fell in a nice little neat pile, didn't even hit any of the buildings that were literally 40 feet from it.
[00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:11.706]  And that's in my film martial law, Rise of the Police State.
[00:29:12.026 --> 00:29:14.627]  I mean, I go there, and I'm standing in between the two buildings.
[00:29:14.807 --> 00:29:15.908]  They're building the new Building 7.
[00:29:17.409 --> 00:29:20.251]  And I mean, I'm standing right there, and it is just 40 feet.
[00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:26.855]  And there's these old concrete buildings, 20, 25-story buildings, right next to it on both sides.
[00:29:27.575 --> 00:29:27.975]  Nothing!
[00:29:28.136 --> 00:29:28.796]  Not a zip!
[00:29:30.652 --> 00:29:32.033]  You know, it wasn't even in the debris field.
[00:29:32.113 --> 00:29:33.214]  It got hit by some dust.
[00:29:33.674 --> 00:29:39.238]  By the way, the command center running the attacks, we know, was inside there.
[00:29:39.298 --> 00:29:41.059]  So you torch the evidence after you're done.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.643]  If your building was owned by Silverstein, it was annihilated.
[00:29:46.103 --> 00:29:48.625]  But if it was right next to 1 and 2 and you didn't own it?
[00:29:49.025 --> 00:29:49.586]  Oh, no problem.
[00:29:51.627 --> 00:29:52.508]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:54.609]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.629 --> 00:29:58.192]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.207 --> 00:30:07.311]  Do you have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:12.374]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way.
[00:30:12.575 --> 00:30:15.496]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201.
[00:30:16.777 --> 00:30:22.321]  We'll negotiate with your creditors and settle your credit card debt for about half of what you now owe without filing bankruptcy.
[00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:26.925]  Debt Relief USA has been helping people just like you regain control of their financial future.
[00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:30.168]  In most cases, you can be debt-free in less than 36 months.
[00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:34.091]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[00:30:34.231 --> 00:30:37.194]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[00:30:37.374 --> 00:30:39.375]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[00:30:39.576 --> 00:30:43.219]  They set up a plan for me where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:47.062]  I'm back in control of my life, and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.
[00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:51.625]  Call Debt Relief USA today for your free consultation.
[00:30:51.645 --> 00:30:52.225]  800-509-3201.
[00:30:52.926 --> 00:30:54.847]  Pay your creditors and avoid bankruptcy.
[00:30:54.967 --> 00:30:59.790]  Call now.
[00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.850]  800-509-3201.
[00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:00.651]  800-509-3201.
[00:31:01.051 --> 00:31:04.073]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.373 --> 00:31:09.296]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.556 --> 00:31:13.819]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:23.124]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.325 --> 00:31:26.947]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.227 --> 00:31:32.270]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:39.254]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:40.408]  What about you?
[00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:46.433]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.473 --> 00:31:47.574]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.654 --> 00:31:49.556]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.961 --> 00:32:08.446]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.866 --> 00:32:13.109]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:20.375]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.756 --> 00:32:26.881]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.001 --> 00:32:28.222]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.422 --> 00:32:28.902]  We're good to go.
[00:32:28.922 --> 00:32:29.402]  We're good to go.
[00:32:45.328 --> 00:32:48.490]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:48.570]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.810]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.770]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:49.990]  Call today.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.762]  Jason, Mike, many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:13.802 --> 00:33:14.602]  Toll free number 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:14.802 --> 00:33:24.289]  We're going to get into Russian pilots to make rain stay away at military parade.
[00:33:24.329 --> 00:33:25.750]  ABC News out of Australia.
[00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:27.655]  Oh, yeah, they can control the weather.
[00:33:27.675 --> 00:33:28.616]  They're going to be dropping by.
[00:33:29.577 --> 00:33:34.782]  Government researchers, again, tested AIDS drugs on foster children, deadly toxic ones that killed some of them.
[00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:35.643]  That's okay.
[00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:36.424]  It's your government.
[00:33:36.624 --> 00:33:37.025]  They're good.
[00:33:37.405 --> 00:33:39.847]  Italian website banned over Nazi Pope picture.
[00:33:40.348 --> 00:33:41.609]  Really scary report.
[00:33:43.631 --> 00:33:44.512]  It's all coming up.
[00:33:44.592 --> 00:33:49.177]  But here for the next few minutes, I'm honored to have the gracious, the sweet...
[00:33:50.316 --> 00:34:00.104]  The intelligent Debbie Morrow, who will be the person you talk to when you call to get the sheltering in place video or potassium iodate to protect you from radiological events if they're to take place.
[00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:03.827]  Something the post office and the police have all been given, but you haven't.
[00:34:04.948 --> 00:34:10.493]  Or if you call to get a sports bottle to give as a gift or to be able to take tap water and make it good to drink, 600 refills.
[00:34:12.363 --> 00:34:18.506]  Or if you want to get one of the big, nice, black Berkey systems that I use in my home that I've given as a gift, she's the lady you'll talk to.
[00:34:18.526 --> 00:34:21.288]  Debbie, good to have you on with us on this Thursday edition.
[00:34:21.568 --> 00:34:22.188]  Hi, Alex.
[00:34:22.308 --> 00:34:24.149]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:26.030]  You bet.
[00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:26.911]  How are you?
[00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:30.633]  Sounds like somebody's having fun in the background.
[00:34:30.793 --> 00:34:33.334]  My little rat carrier just decided to bark at somebody.
[00:34:33.534 --> 00:34:33.734]  I know.
[00:34:33.754 --> 00:34:35.155]  They're sweetie pies, aren't they?
[00:34:35.515 --> 00:34:36.215]  Yes, he is.
[00:34:36.235 --> 00:34:38.376]  My wife's got two little horrible chihuahuas.
[00:34:38.637 --> 00:34:38.677]  Oh.
[00:34:39.713 --> 00:34:41.474]  And by horrible, I mean that affectionately.
[00:34:41.514 --> 00:34:42.514]  Yes, I know you do.
[00:34:42.934 --> 00:34:43.975]  Oh, that's so good.
[00:34:44.195 --> 00:34:45.676]  So what's your rat terrier's name?
[00:34:45.916 --> 00:34:46.856]  His name is Buddy.
[00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:46.976]  Buddy.
[00:34:47.436 --> 00:34:47.857]  Yes.
[00:34:48.177 --> 00:34:49.537]  Does he sleep with you?
[00:34:50.158 --> 00:34:50.778]  He does.
[00:34:51.058 --> 00:34:51.658]  You're right.
[00:34:51.978 --> 00:34:53.379]  Right down by our feet.
[00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:54.800]  Exactly.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.901]  I've got two chihuahuas as foot warmers.
[00:34:58.421 --> 00:34:58.621]  Yep.
[00:34:59.522 --> 00:35:01.402]  It's amazing how they can even breathe.
[00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:03.863]  It's like, how in the world do they do that?
[00:35:04.284 --> 00:35:05.824]  Yeah, somebody must be at my door.
[00:35:05.844 --> 00:35:07.385]  This is really embarrassing.
[00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:09.360]  I was expecting a delivery.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.901]  Hey, Debbie, we'll put you on hold.
[00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:11.701]  Go get your delivery.
[00:35:11.741 --> 00:35:12.382]  Put me on hold.
[00:35:12.402 --> 00:35:12.662]  Thank you.
[00:35:12.682 --> 00:35:13.322]  Put her on hold.
[00:35:13.963 --> 00:35:15.164]  She's going to go get the delivery.
[00:35:15.824 --> 00:35:19.606]  And by the way, New Millennium Manufactures makes these.
[00:35:20.047 --> 00:35:21.027]  It's a big company.
[00:35:21.508 --> 00:35:25.290]  But Debbie is the person they have just for the radio interviews.
[00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.552]  She's been there for many years, and she's out of her home office.
[00:35:28.592 --> 00:35:35.076]  And when you call, you get, again, individual service from Debbie Morrow and her Rat Terrier buddy.
[00:35:37.088 --> 00:35:39.549]  But, again, they also sell the British Berkey.
[00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:41.610]  That's how they got into this over a decade ago.
[00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.811]  And they have that as well, but they improved on it.
[00:35:44.272 --> 00:35:45.512]  They've had major universities.
[00:35:45.712 --> 00:35:50.055]  The big one in Louisiana did a big study of it.
[00:35:50.715 --> 00:36:02.681]  And whereas with the other gravity filters, which cut out almost everything, they do a great job, still under an electron microscope, if you take mud water, they basically test them with what they call long growth,
[00:36:03.712 --> 00:36:05.694]  Green-type stagnant water.
[00:36:06.034 --> 00:36:22.007]  They poured that through, and they put it in a Petri dish after it had gone through for a week, put an electron microscope on it, and there was zero, but scientists don't say zero, they say non-detectable levels of just everything you can imagine.
[00:36:23.549 --> 00:36:30.314]  But fluoride is so uber-mentioned, so powerful, that even with reverse osmosis, you only cut about 90% out.
[00:36:31.576 --> 00:36:37.878]  Well, with the Black Berkey, with the added little filters that go onto it, it's hard to get rid of.
[00:36:38.318 --> 00:36:42.999]  You get 99.8% of fluoride cut out.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.640]  It's unbelievable.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.501]  So, that's why we use it.
[00:36:49.121 --> 00:36:49.882]  That's what we do.
[00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.382]  We have a reverse osmosis for cooking.
[00:36:52.402 --> 00:36:55.683]  You're already going to have minerals in the vegetables, the organic vegetables we eat.
[00:36:56.083 --> 00:37:01.165]  But for grunting, for flavor, because it does leave in the good minerals, we have a Black Berkey
[00:37:01.903 --> 00:37:07.285]  And I still have one I bought five years ago, a white Berkey, the British Berkey, the stainless steel Berkey.
[00:37:07.305 --> 00:37:09.185]  So they've got whatever you want.
[00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:12.466]  And they've also got rat terrier puppies for sale.
[00:37:12.506 --> 00:37:12.946]  I'm joking.
[00:37:13.466 --> 00:37:20.088]  Debbie, fire out the phone numbers for folks that want to call and get information or order any of the great items you guys offer.
[00:37:20.308 --> 00:37:21.628]  They're made in America.
[00:37:21.769 --> 00:37:24.669]  All of it's made in America, unless you want the British Berkey.
[00:37:25.169 --> 00:37:25.510]  Go ahead.
[00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.130]  Hi, thanks, Alex.
[00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:28.910]  It's toll-free 1-888-
[00:37:31.607 --> 00:37:31.667]  888-803-4438.
[00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:32.187]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:37:32.247 --> 00:37:33.808]  And I'm so sorry about that.
[00:37:33.828 --> 00:37:38.271]  Happy to put me on hold, but I'm so glad to be here.
[00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:39.331]  Oh, come on.
[00:37:39.351 --> 00:37:42.373]  Stop apologizing, Debbie.
[00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:43.133]  You're a sweetheart.
[00:37:43.153 --> 00:37:43.193]  888-803-4438.
[00:37:52.302 --> 00:37:56.226]  And tell people the difference between a sports bottle and what it does.
[00:37:56.246 --> 00:37:59.629]  It just makes sure the water's safe and cuts out a lot of garbage, which is good.
[00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:03.852]  And compare it then to the $199 Black Berkey.
[00:38:04.453 --> 00:38:09.137]  Well, the Berkey sport bottles take out about 99% of the pathogens.
[00:38:09.618 --> 00:38:14.362]  They're 22-ounce, and they're very, very convenient for taking around with you.
[00:38:14.853 --> 00:38:18.157]  For people that already have some, we have a new model now.
[00:38:19.299 --> 00:38:25.367]  The model that we had previously had the filter in the top and you turned it over and you squeezed your water into a cup.
[00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:29.993]  We now have a model that you drink it just like you're drinking a soda out of a straw.
[00:38:30.413 --> 00:38:32.295]  The filter hangs down in the bottom.
[00:38:32.375 --> 00:38:33.136]  I got one of those.
[00:38:33.196 --> 00:38:34.797]  That is a big element, too.
[00:38:35.958 --> 00:38:38.060]  They're great, too, because they're so handy.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.945]  You don't have to choke on it while you're squeezing it and trying to drink at the same time.
[00:38:43.025 --> 00:38:43.906]  I just want to say this.
[00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:51.753]  Back in another incarnation, when I had more time, I would hunt and fish and camp five or six times a year.
[00:38:52.809 --> 00:39:03.224]  Sometimes for a week on end in a deep wilderness area, and I would go into the camping supply and pay $35 for one of these things with a little bitty element, and it did make the water safe.
[00:39:03.644 --> 00:39:08.972]  You guys, your element's about three times bigger than any element I've ever seen in a sports bottle.
[00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:13.136]  Yeah, they are bigger and they last up to 640 refills.
[00:39:13.156 --> 00:39:15.038]  And the other ones I bought would say 200, yeah.
[00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:15.459]  Right.
[00:39:15.779 --> 00:39:17.161]  And they're bacterial static.
[00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:21.545]  You know, they have special properties in them to keep bacteria from growing in the straw and stuff.
[00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:24.108]  I mean, they really do work really well.
[00:39:24.168 --> 00:39:28.813]  Now, isn't your $100, and those are $20 if you get five of them, right?
[00:39:28.994 --> 00:39:29.194]  Correct.
[00:39:30.345 --> 00:39:41.549]  And also, it's $199 for the big, you know, two-gallon, see-through, high-quality, plexiglass-type black murky with the elements, the black elements inside.
[00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:42.589]  How much do they want?
[00:39:42.689 --> 00:39:46.970]  And that reduces fluoride, but how much for the post filters that go on the spigot?
[00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:56.974]  The post filters that go on, attached to the black murky filters for taking out fluoride and arsenic related to the fluoride are $49.00.
[00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:09.956]  And, you know, if you call in and say that you're an Alex Jones listener and you buy the Berkey Light for $1.99, then you can ask for a free Berkey Sport Bottle, which is a $39 savings.
[00:40:12.253 --> 00:40:17.916]  And so then, you know, if you do or don't have fluoride, that's an additional filter that you can add with it.
[00:40:18.296 --> 00:40:19.816]  And you've also got shower filters.
[00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:23.698]  That's where you absorb a lot of the garbage into your lungs and the rest of it.
[00:40:23.718 --> 00:40:23.878]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:23.938 --> 00:40:27.660]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.221]  Alex, thank you so much for having me.
[00:40:30.421 --> 00:40:31.362]  Talk to you soon.
[00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:31.882]  Take care.
[00:40:32.382 --> 00:40:34.243]  Folks, I've met her up in Dallas at an expo.
[00:40:34.263 --> 00:40:35.383]  She is such a nice lady.
[00:40:35.403 --> 00:40:38.144]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:38.184 --> 00:40:39.024]  It's just her there.
[00:40:39.744 --> 00:40:41.905]  If you call and it's busy, leave your name and number.
[00:40:41.925 --> 00:40:43.345]  She'll call you right back within the hour.
[00:40:43.365 --> 00:40:45.966]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:48.527]  Or if you're going to be leaving work, leave your home number.
[00:40:48.547 --> 00:40:49.027]  She'll call you.
[00:40:49.047 --> 00:40:49.567]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:50.768 --> 00:40:54.649]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com and in the comments section,
[00:40:55.249 --> 00:41:00.651]  Tell them which free gift you want in the comments section, and you'll get that.
[00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:01.912]  You get two free gifts.
[00:41:01.932 --> 00:41:08.494]  You get the Berkey light with the built-in LED lights and rechargeable system that comes with that.
[00:41:08.514 --> 00:41:10.415]  888-803-4438 or berkeywater.com.
[00:41:11.175 --> 00:41:14.897]  And they get the orders off their website every day, and they ship them UPS ground.
[00:41:15.457 --> 00:41:22.840]  If you order them off infowars.com, we process the orders every day, but then fax the order to them, and it'll take a day or two more if you order through us.
[00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:30.894]  But then we make a few bucks, which helps me pay my employees so they can, you know, eat and be able to take care of themselves.
[00:41:30.954 --> 00:41:36.656]  But either way, you can get it at InfoWars.com, BerkeyWater.com, or 888-803-4438.
[00:41:37.057 --> 00:41:37.497]  All right.
[00:41:38.417 --> 00:41:41.599]  We'll get to all the news I mentioned earlier, but first let's go to the calls.
[00:41:41.739 --> 00:41:42.979]  Jason in Maryland.
[00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:43.940]  Jason, welcome.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:44.880]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.341]  Thanks.
[00:41:45.641 --> 00:41:46.061]  Hello, sir.
[00:41:46.381 --> 00:41:49.883]  With the things that I've learned listening to your show about the scripted...
[00:41:51.034 --> 00:41:52.835]  Yeah, he's a secret agent.
[00:41:52.895 --> 00:41:55.396]  He doesn't know who he is.
[00:41:55.416 --> 00:41:56.316]  Right.
[00:41:56.356 --> 00:41:57.696]  Not the one I've seen yet.
[00:41:57.736 --> 00:41:59.377]  They're bringing suitcase nukes into cities.
[00:42:17.403 --> 00:42:26.945]  It's the previews that I saw for next week, and they're saying that there's nothing they can do about it, and they don't want to tell anybody because it's going to cause panic, and that was the trailer for next week's series.
[00:42:27.005 --> 00:42:35.847]  And it's the same thing on 24 and Threat Matrix, but if we all take chips and torture Americans and let men in black uniforms take all our rights, then we might be safe.
[00:42:36.087 --> 00:42:36.507]  Of course.
[00:42:36.927 --> 00:42:37.967]  But the border stays wide open.
[00:42:38.307 --> 00:42:40.648]  And then on numbers, there are...
[00:42:43.058 --> 00:42:44.159]  Well, we don't think it's legitimate.
[00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:49.001]  We have government documents where they have, again, big old DC-10s and other former passenger planes.
[00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:11.571]  They have them with particle beams, chemical lasers that'll shoot right through missiles, you name it.
[00:43:11.591 --> 00:43:21.734]  They also have them with huge hologram projectors, and the computers link up, and they project, you know, 500,000 foot tall Jesus, Buddha, Allah.
[00:43:21.994 --> 00:43:23.714]  That's admitted government programming.
[00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:27.495]  They also have a program to project fake flying saucers.
[00:43:27.515 --> 00:43:30.396]  They have blimps rigged up to look like flying saucers.
[00:43:30.616 --> 00:43:31.937]  It's a major government program.
[00:43:32.177 --> 00:43:32.917]  I had no idea.
[00:43:33.925 --> 00:43:35.045]  No, it's real, sir.
[00:43:35.506 --> 00:43:45.109]  Well, imparting my last question to you would be, why do you think Mr. Mousali was allowed to live and apparently speaking in court?
[00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.251]  You're talking about Zacharias Mousali, the supposed 20th hijacker?
[00:43:50.291 --> 00:43:50.531]  Yes.
[00:43:51.792 --> 00:43:57.054]  Well, I mean, he's the only person they've charged out of thousands, it's like 4,000 arrests now,
[00:43:58.929 --> 00:44:04.213]  And he's the guy at the flight school going, I don't want to know how to take off or land.
[00:44:05.754 --> 00:44:13.799]  And the owner of the flight school called the FBI five times and began threatening to go public if they didn't do something.
[00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:18.662]  And then the good FBI agents, Robert Wright, Rowley, others, tried to...
[00:44:19.887 --> 00:44:23.208]  Go in and get a warrant for his computer.
[00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:27.469]  And the FBI said no, because Bush had signed W-199I.
[00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:28.850]  Clinton had issued it before them.
[00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.070]  Bush had just reauthorized.
[00:44:30.951 --> 00:44:35.412]  And then they told Wright, keep your mouth shut or we'll arrest you under national security.
[00:44:35.432 --> 00:44:42.214]  And Musali is obviously one of the actual patsies, and he's been trying to say that in court.
[00:44:42.254 --> 00:44:44.135]  They won't let him face any of his accusers.
[00:44:44.635 --> 00:44:46.055]  They won't let him call witnesses.
[00:44:46.675 --> 00:44:48.276]  And so that's playing out nicely.
[00:44:48.866 --> 00:44:53.887]  So he is not really a threat, even though he might be privy to some information.
[00:44:54.147 --> 00:44:56.188]  Yeah, he's a French useful idiot.
[00:44:57.048 --> 00:44:58.628]  They've always got to have one patsy.
[00:44:58.668 --> 00:45:01.909]  With the Reichstag, it was a retarded Dutch man.
[00:45:03.049 --> 00:45:13.512]  With the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, it was a small mosque that had about 25 members above a pizza parlor with a blind cleric.
[00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:22.224]  And they literally got two members of the mosque who were both clinically retarded on welfare for being retarded.
[00:45:22.844 --> 00:45:26.886]  And it took the FBI a month to train one of them how to drive.
[00:45:27.426 --> 00:45:33.168]  The FBI went and showed them where to park it up against the column, the people the FBI had hired.
[00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:36.309]  And they had to cook the bomb, train the driver.
[00:45:36.369 --> 00:45:38.230]  They had to give them the detonators.
[00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:42.072]  And then Ahmad Salam said, okay, they're about to carry out the bombing.
[00:45:42.112 --> 00:45:42.772]  Let's sting them.
[00:45:43.664 --> 00:45:49.431]  And he was a security agent, Egyptian equivalent of a CIA agent.
[00:45:49.832 --> 00:45:55.999]  He thought it was a sting, because he'd run similar stings with real Muslim extremists in Egypt.
[00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:57.801]  And they said, no, the bombing goes forward.
[00:45:57.841 --> 00:45:59.142]  He thought it was a setup for him.
[00:45:59.162 --> 00:46:03.548]  So he went and recorded them in like 15 hours of arguments.
[00:46:04.176 --> 00:46:05.877]  And gave a press conference and released that.
[00:46:05.897 --> 00:46:08.158]  It was in the New York Times, Chicago Tribune one time.
[00:46:08.498 --> 00:46:10.179]  The FBI did carry out the bombing, of course.
[00:46:10.379 --> 00:46:11.539]  They released those tapes?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.162]  Yes, and he played them at a press conference, and they seized them under national security.
[00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:19.339]  Wow.
[00:46:19.739 --> 00:46:24.062]  And then paid him off, I think it was 1.5 mil, and he left the country.
[00:46:24.082 --> 00:46:25.483]  They paid him to shut up.
[00:46:26.003 --> 00:46:30.466]  Can you please explain to me in a nutshell what W199I is?
[00:46:30.806 --> 00:46:32.007]  And I'll take the answer off here.
[00:46:32.047 --> 00:46:32.387]  Thank you.
[00:46:32.607 --> 00:46:33.748]  Thank you.
[00:46:33.788 --> 00:46:46.276]  We have a copy of what was, again, Gregory Pallast, the Newsnight chief reporter, an award-winning investigative journalist, was faxed.
[00:46:47.719 --> 00:46:53.423]  Days before 9-11, and in fact more material after 9-11, and we know who, we won't give up the source, but we know who.
[00:46:55.044 --> 00:47:04.930]  It was former FBI Deputy Director who quit a month before 9-11, John O'Neill, who by the way died in the towers mysteriously.
[00:47:05.538 --> 00:47:06.978]  Because he didn't see the full picture.
[00:47:06.998 --> 00:47:10.259]  He was hired as the head of security by Marvin Bush's company.
[00:47:10.279 --> 00:47:11.240]  He was running security.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:19.262]  And his first day at work was to report to, what, the 76th floor, one of the exact impact points of one of the towers.
[00:47:19.702 --> 00:47:22.223]  He did report to work and didn't do too well, as we all know.
[00:47:22.243 --> 00:47:25.344]  Yeah, I saw a plane coming right in at him.
[00:47:25.704 --> 00:47:27.465]  Boy, they know how to do it, don't they?
[00:47:29.973 --> 00:47:36.897]  He told London Telegraph and others, and London Independent also reported, a month before he quit, he went to Europe.
[00:47:37.517 --> 00:47:44.662]  He said one of the quotes was that they're going to allow a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center as a pretext to get Afghan oil.
[00:47:45.002 --> 00:47:46.002]  So he didn't see the whole thing.
[00:47:46.643 --> 00:47:51.566]  And he quit over it, was very disgusted, he was a good man, and they whacked him on 9-11.
[00:47:53.826 --> 00:48:04.173]  And W-199 got released, and Clinton had first signed it in 1996, ordering Hamas to be left alone and Al-Qaeda in this country.
[00:48:04.753 --> 00:48:06.834]  And then Bush had reauthorized it months before 9-11.
[00:48:07.795 --> 00:48:09.796]  And so the FBI field office in D.C.
[00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:19.499]  From a deputy director's fax machine was sent to Greg Palast and other members of the media here, but only Greg Palast picked it up.
[00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:26.883]  He was sent, I think it was 40 pages, he said, but BBC would only let him release the front two pages.
[00:48:27.264 --> 00:48:28.965]  He was going to release it all, but the U.S.
[00:48:29.025 --> 00:48:32.747]  government, they have a law in England that the government says don't release something.
[00:48:33.067 --> 00:48:33.468]  They can't.
[00:48:33.488 --> 00:48:33.768]  The U.S.
[00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:38.831]  government asked them to put in that clause, activate that clause, so it was never fully released.
[00:48:40.413 --> 00:48:42.034]  But it's all come out.
[00:48:42.094 --> 00:48:44.856]  FBI agents have given press conferences about it where they were, quote, ordered.
[00:48:45.357 --> 00:48:49.940]  And then Robert Wright got up in 2002 and started crying.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.544]  The Chicago chief terrorism agent started crying with the head of Judicial Watch, Larry Klayman.
[00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:58.627]  Started crying and said, here's the letter.
[00:48:58.667 --> 00:48:59.447]  I'll be arrested.
[00:48:59.467 --> 00:49:01.169]  And they circulated the letter.
[00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:04.211]  If I tell you what I know, I just love this country and we could have stopped it.
[00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:05.812]  But I was ordered not to.
[00:49:05.832 --> 00:49:06.793]  He started crying and then...
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.343]  Larry Kleiman got up and pushed him aside and said, Yes, it's true.
[00:49:11.363 --> 00:49:12.224]  I've been given the letter, too.
[00:49:12.304 --> 00:49:14.386]  So has David Shepard, who was there via phone.
[00:49:15.487 --> 00:49:23.335]  And David Shepard also told you the same stuff here months before, what, a week after 9-11 on this show, the man who ran the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[00:49:24.717 --> 00:49:28.321]  And Larry Kleiman said, All we can tell you is the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Laden's.
[00:49:31.154 --> 00:49:38.799]  And so it came out that FBI agents in Phoenix, FBI agents in Dallas, FBI agents in Minneapolis-St.
[00:49:38.839 --> 00:49:52.168]  Paul, FBI agents in Wisconsin, FBI agents in New York, FBI agents in D.C., FBI agents in San Francisco, FBI agents in Albuquerque, FBI agents everywhere were threatened with arrest if they tried to stop Al C.I.
[00:49:52.288 --> 00:49:52.528]  Ada.
[00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:55.691]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:56.231]  Go ahead.
[00:49:56.851 --> 00:49:57.772]  Yes, good morning, Alex.
[00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:02.653]  I'd like to touch on this Larry Franklin APAC thing.
[00:50:03.953 --> 00:50:09.097]  Yesterday, it seems to be getting some conflicting reports here.
[00:50:09.337 --> 00:50:11.358]  For those who don't know, tell me what you're talking about.
[00:50:12.118 --> 00:50:22.505]  Okay, there is a political action committee, it's called APAC, American Israeli Political Action Committee, and they lobby Congress to get benefits for Israel.
[00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:28.408]  And Mr. Franklin, he worked in the Department of Defense underneath Wolfowitz and Fife.
[00:50:28.688 --> 00:50:28.968]  Yes.
[00:50:29.248 --> 00:50:40.973]  And he was collecting documents, and I guess he had passed some information to plans on attacking Iran, those to AIPAC, to pass them on to Iran.
[00:50:41.473 --> 00:50:44.074]  And yesterday he was arrested by the FBI.
[00:50:44.554 --> 00:50:50.276]  I just find it odd that the mainstream media just wants to say that it's an organization with ties to Israel.
[00:50:50.316 --> 00:50:51.136]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:51.156 --> 00:50:52.377]  Stay there.
[00:50:53.203 --> 00:50:58.105]  No, it's an Israeli intelligence gathering operation undermining this nation.
[00:51:01.327 --> 00:51:05.668]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.848 --> 00:51:10.270]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:14.812]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.852 --> 00:51:16.193]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:17.914]  Pan Amers.
[00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:22.196]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.256 --> 00:51:29.181]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:31.382]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.542 --> 00:51:42.088]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:44.730]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then

[00:52:13.906 --> 00:52:18.569]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.049 --> 00:52:25.774]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.174 --> 00:52:37.943]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.443 --> 00:52:42.889]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:54:07.814 --> 00:54:10.335]  All these governments are, are mafias.
[00:54:11.436 --> 00:54:14.577]  You've got your Arab mafias over the Middle East, very corrupt.
[00:54:14.597 --> 00:54:15.757]  You've got your Israeli mafia.
[00:54:15.777 --> 00:54:17.418]  You've got our government mafia.
[00:54:17.778 --> 00:54:21.159]  And basically they all just work together, or occasionally they fight with each other.
[00:54:21.219 --> 00:54:23.860]  And yeah, Israeli spies get arrested all the time.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.740]  And they never seem to get in trouble.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.221]  They get arrested, then they get released.
[00:54:27.904 --> 00:54:35.947]  Then nothing happens, or they release him, they jump on a plane back to Tel Aviv, and then it's a minor footnote in the news, but finish up what you were saying, Mike.
[00:54:37.948 --> 00:54:38.969]  In Arizona, you still there?
[00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:39.929]  Yes, I am.
[00:54:39.949 --> 00:54:41.010]  I was going to let you finish up.
[00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.350]  Go ahead.
[00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:53.375]  Okay, well, this is obviously espionage, and espionage during a time of war is punishable by death, but Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez has already come out and said that we're going to go easy on this guy.
[00:54:54.247 --> 00:54:58.332]  And that was an interview by CIA Ray McGovern this morning, I heard.
[00:54:59.193 --> 00:55:08.083]  And if anybody would like any more information about APAC and the extreme pressure that they can bring on the Congress, Department of Defense, and the State Department...
[00:55:08.652 --> 00:55:13.094]  Paul Findley, a representative from Illinois, wrote a book called They Dare to Speak Out.
[00:55:13.495 --> 00:55:15.596]  And maybe you could get him on your show sometime.
[00:55:15.656 --> 00:55:17.697]  Send me an email with the info, and thanks for the call.
[00:55:17.837 --> 00:55:18.597]  Okay.
[00:55:18.637 --> 00:55:26.882]  Yeah, Israeli Mossad-controlled companies control the caller ID database that like 90% of the country uses.
[00:55:28.129 --> 00:55:31.032]  They're involved in wiretapping our government.
[00:55:31.312 --> 00:55:34.815]  They run the security for the Pentagon, you name it, for the phones.
[00:55:35.435 --> 00:55:36.676]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:55:36.736 --> 00:55:38.498]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:55:38.878 --> 00:55:40.119]  And we shouldn't put up with it.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.721]  Oh, we can trust Israel.
[00:55:42.762 --> 00:55:43.282]  No, we can't.
[00:55:44.963 --> 00:55:48.847]  Israel has been caught selling arms to Iran, China, Pakistan.
[00:55:50.248 --> 00:55:51.649]  Our government does it to some of the British.
[00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:53.831]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:57.673]  No one's got connections to al-Qaeda like our government in Israel.
[00:55:58.013 --> 00:56:00.075]  No one's got connections to Hamas like Israel.
[00:56:00.375 --> 00:56:09.701]  You know, it's come out in major harats and UPI and others, but even Israeli papers, that there are fake al-Qaeda groups Israel controls that carry out bombings in Israel.
[00:56:09.881 --> 00:56:11.262]  Now, that's not Alex Jones.
[00:56:12.582 --> 00:56:13.843]  That's Israeli newspapers.
[00:56:15.224 --> 00:56:19.647]  And they create these crises so they have a pretext to keep their police state going.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.281]  Which everybody lives in Israel.
[00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:23.822]  Jews and Palestinians.
[00:56:24.283 --> 00:56:24.803]  And Arabs.
[00:56:25.644 --> 00:56:27.125]  I mean, it's a mess, folks.
[00:56:27.725 --> 00:56:29.647]  And I'm not against Israel itself.
[00:56:30.667 --> 00:56:34.550]  About half the people living in Israel, the Jews, half the Jews are against what Israel's doing.
[00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:38.213]  You know, they have censorship, they have control, they have all this.
[00:56:38.413 --> 00:56:42.876]  It's all about an endless fog of war, an endless emergency.
[00:56:42.916 --> 00:56:45.338]  Governments need these to keep control.
[00:56:46.616 --> 00:56:51.682]  And Israel and its intelligence agencies dwarf Russia and Germany and France.
[00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:53.324]  They're espionage.
[00:56:54.105 --> 00:56:56.147]  Because it's looked on as acceptable.
[00:56:56.167 --> 00:56:57.509]  It is not acceptable.
[00:57:00.051 --> 00:57:01.793]  We're going to start the second hour.
[00:57:01.814 --> 00:57:02.634]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:57:03.115 --> 00:57:05.658]  And we'll get to Fred and Steve and everybody early in this next hour.
[00:57:06.078 --> 00:57:07.240]  Before I end this hour...
[00:57:08.721 --> 00:57:18.948]  In the last minute and a half here, my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is a miniseries, three films in one, three hours on DVD, two and a half plus hours on VHS.
[00:57:20.769 --> 00:57:22.430]  It is my best work, as I've said many times.
[00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:29.214]  It covers the police state, 9-11, and who the elite are, their Nazi occult connections to Schwarzenegger, Bush, all of it.
[00:57:29.234 --> 00:57:30.415]  It really is powerful.
[00:57:30.535 --> 00:57:34.038]  And the latest police state developments are also there with the Patriot Act and...
[00:57:35.006 --> 00:57:35.467]  We're good to go.
[00:57:52.003 --> 00:57:53.745]  Because I want you to get multiple copies.
[00:57:53.785 --> 00:57:57.768]  Got a bunch of other big discounts going on the other films right now as well.
[00:57:58.329 --> 00:58:05.456]  So go to InfoWars.com, peruse the safe, secure shopping cart, watch clips of the films, read about the films, and order them today.
[00:58:05.476 --> 00:58:05.536]  1-888-253-3139.

[00:58:31.938 --> 00:58:34.159]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:34.419 --> 00:58:35.060]  Don't wait.
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.440]  Get the new film.
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.982]  It's already sending shockwaves across the country.
[00:58:39.002 --> 00:58:39.042]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:40.322]  The second hour...
[00:58:45.905 --> 00:58:49.226]  A ton of news in your calls and a great guest straight ahead.
[00:58:57.707 --> 00:58:58.368]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.028 --> 00:59:00.108]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.788 --> 00:59:01.908]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.528 --> 00:59:03.409]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:06.049]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:09.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:13.931]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:18.039]  We're good to go.
[00:59:32.817 --> 00:59:36.481]  All right, my friends, it's Thursday, the fifth day of May 2005.
[00:59:36.841 --> 00:59:40.785]  I know we got a lot of phone calls online.
[00:59:40.805 --> 00:59:42.306]  We'll be getting to those early in this hour.
[00:59:42.326 --> 00:59:43.207]  A ton of news.
[00:59:43.687 --> 00:59:49.533]  This obvious election stunt of these toy grenades going off in New York.
[00:59:49.733 --> 00:59:50.694]  Classic M.O.
[00:59:50.734 --> 00:59:51.054]  of M.I.6.
[00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:56.352]  Russian pilots to make rain stay away at military parade, ABC News.
[00:59:56.792 --> 00:59:58.412]  Just an example of weather control.
[00:59:58.973 --> 01:00:04.015]  Everyone, researchers tested AIDS drugs on foster children, deadly toxic drugs that even killed some of them.
[01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:06.856]  Italian website banned over Nazi Pope picture.
[01:00:07.296 --> 01:00:11.537]  We'll talk about why that's so important, why that's so dangerous to free speech.
[01:00:12.118 --> 01:00:13.518]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[01:00:14.859 --> 01:00:19.520]  A few weeks ago I had a chance to hear him on Jack Blood's broadcast, and I was aware of his work already.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.901]  We post some of his articles.
[01:00:21.904 --> 01:00:23.345]  From his powerful website.
[01:00:23.785 --> 01:00:29.168]  But he's going to be with us this hour and into the next if he'd like to stay with us to talk about left gatekeepers.
[01:00:29.188 --> 01:00:33.069]  And I'm aware of the church hearings decades ago in Congress.
[01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:43.534]  I'm aware of Operation Mockingbird, of what the tax-free foundations are doing, how they control the false left paradigm to make sure that change never takes place down at the grassroots level.
[01:00:44.495 --> 01:00:50.878]  But he's done a masterful job from their own documents and public statements from compiling how the left is controlled.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.902]  And so Charles Shaw now joins us.
[01:00:55.582 --> 01:00:59.284]  And Charles, it's great to have you with us.
[01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:00.944]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:01:01.004 --> 01:01:02.505]  It's really great to be on your show.
[01:01:04.046 --> 01:01:07.608]  Before we go any further, fire out your website and who you are and how you got involved.
[01:01:08.508 --> 01:01:12.030]  Well, the website and the publication is called Newtopia.
[01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:19.894]  It's newtopiamagazine.com or newtopiamagazine.net or .org.
[01:01:22.317 --> 01:01:25.498]  I'm the publisher and chief editor.
[01:01:25.679 --> 01:01:28.680]  I founded it, oh, three years ago.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:36.505]  And it was mostly out of an inability to get a lot of my work published in the so-called progressive media.
[01:01:36.645 --> 01:01:37.526]  Well, it looks good.
[01:01:37.566 --> 01:01:39.527]  The site looks good, but the material's even better.
[01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:43.155]  Well, we've actually come a long way.
[01:01:43.235 --> 01:01:45.736]  We've built a really respectable, healthy readership.
[01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:47.478]  We've got some really great contributors.
[01:01:48.598 --> 01:01:55.643]  We give people the freedom to say what they want to say, which is unlike the people we'll be discussing on your show today.
[01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:57.604]  Absolutely.
[01:02:00.186 --> 01:02:02.367]  I want to get into the structure of it yourself.
[01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:03.908]  You've got a nice little graph there.
[01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:07.010]  This is public available knowledge.
[01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:16.106]  And so you wonder why you go to a little neoliberal meeting, that's what they've been called for many years, neoliberals, and you wonder why there's nothing substantive.
[01:02:16.146 --> 01:02:17.768]  It's mindless chant.
[01:02:19.329 --> 01:02:20.790]  It's centralized.
[01:02:20.951 --> 01:02:22.232]  It's idiocy.
[01:02:22.792 --> 01:02:24.414]  And you've really documented this.
[01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:25.435]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.815 --> 01:02:33.902]  Well, the one thing that really inspired all of this is that I've been a political activist for a number of years now, and I've been deeply involved in the anti-war movement.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.281]  I think we're good.
[01:03:04.895 --> 01:03:15.524]  And now a lot of the grand poobahs, the self-appointed leaders of the 9-11 Truth Movement, are saying, hey, it's over, don't talk about 9-11 anymore, just leave it alone.
[01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:17.625]  Yeah, I hear that.
[01:03:17.826 --> 01:03:21.528]  And, you know, we know some of the personalities who are talking about that.
[01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:22.870]  We should just follow their orders.
[01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.692]  I'm going to shut up now because they told me to.
[01:03:26.132 --> 01:03:27.293]  Right, precisely.
[01:03:27.493 --> 01:03:29.975]  I mean, it's pointless to fight evil.
[01:03:30.436 --> 01:03:30.696]  Well, I...
[01:03:32.088 --> 01:03:39.273]  I think you got certain people who didn't get the response they wanted, and so because they didn't get that response, they're now telling everybody to back off the issue.
[01:03:40.073 --> 01:03:43.295]  Or because they're not following their particular theories to the letter.
[01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:46.297]  But I do think that it's still very much an alive issue.
[01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:47.578]  Oh, it's bigger than ever.
[01:03:47.598 --> 01:03:48.738]  We're on the verge of victory.
[01:03:48.778 --> 01:03:49.319]  Stay with us.
[01:03:49.975 --> 01:03:53.056]  We'll be back and talk about the new, new Left Gatekeeper.
[01:03:53.217 --> 01:04:00.040]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.720]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.142]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.282 --> 01:04:06.363]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:11.565]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.905 --> 01:04:15.947]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.207 --> 01:04:16.648]  We're good to go.
[01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:34.786]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[01:04:34.906 --> 01:04:36.467]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:36.487 --> 01:04:36.867]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:36.887 --> 01:04:39.289]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:40.369]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:04:52.629 --> 01:05:03.357]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:03.537 --> 01:05:11.123]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:06:25.293 --> 01:06:28.254]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[01:06:28.454 --> 01:06:30.455]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[01:06:30.655 --> 01:06:34.296]  They set up a plan for me where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.

[01:07:04.137 --> 01:07:04.978]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.698 --> 01:07:09.401]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.881 --> 01:07:13.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:37.071]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now well into the second hour.
[01:07:37.111 --> 01:07:43.493]  We're talking to Charles Shaw, and he's a journalist, media activist, has a great news website.
[01:07:45.073 --> 01:07:56.697]  And we're now learning, and we've known for years on this broadcast and documented it, there's been congressional hearings, as I said, decades ago about it, that thousands of prominent reporters are on
[01:07:57.429 --> 01:08:07.474]  The Department of Education's payroll, the FBI's payroll, the CIA's payroll, the state police have people on their payroll working in major newspapers.
[01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:12.157]  Now, thousands sounds like a lot, but there are hundreds of thousands of reporters.
[01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:13.838]  But they're key reporters.
[01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:21.802]  But we also have the controlled opposition in the left and the right.
[01:08:22.802 --> 01:08:24.183]  An example is Free Republic.
[01:08:25.197 --> 01:08:33.162]  One of the biggest so-called conservative alternative websites won't let you get on there and post the billboards of Clear Channel putting up billboards saying that L.A.
[01:08:33.202 --> 01:08:33.922]  is Mexico.
[01:08:34.863 --> 01:08:35.784]  They will take it down.
[01:08:36.664 --> 01:08:51.033]  They won't let myself in the past, my listeners, post AP articles about Delta Force anti-terror drills in Texas that were scaring the daylights out of the public and attempted bribery, even when it was in the front page of the San Antonio Express News.
[01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:52.674]  None of that exists.
[01:08:52.814 --> 01:08:54.155]  New World Order doesn't exist.
[01:08:55.315 --> 01:08:56.696]  George Bush is Lord.
[01:08:58.397 --> 01:08:59.197]  He is good.
[01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:01.839]  We see that going on.
[01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:05.381]  But on the other side of it, we have the control left.
[01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:10.743]  And folks, there's Professor Jensen here in Austin who's on national TV on a weekly basis.
[01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:12.264]  And he attacks me.
[01:09:12.284 --> 01:09:13.205]  He can't stand me.
[01:09:13.225 --> 01:09:18.047]  He tried to keep me from speaking in a rally we put on on the one-year anniversary.
[01:09:18.067 --> 01:09:19.468]  I mean, we put it on.
[01:09:19.748 --> 01:09:20.909]  They show up and try to take over.
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:25.551]  And I actually had to have the police that were there, the Crawford police, explain, no, this is their event.
[01:09:26.131 --> 01:09:27.552]  You guys were invited out here to speak.
[01:09:28.092 --> 01:09:28.972]  And they had to step aside.
[01:09:29.012 --> 01:09:30.152]  I mean, these people are amazing.
[01:09:30.972 --> 01:09:32.333]  They don't want the New World Order discussed.
[01:09:32.353 --> 01:09:33.673]  They don't want 9-11 discussed.
[01:09:33.713 --> 01:09:35.494]  They don't want you to hear the Democrats are controlled.
[01:09:36.034 --> 01:09:41.335]  They don't want you to hear the United Nations was set up by the very foundations that control both our political parties.
[01:09:42.776 --> 01:09:43.896]  And we have the facts.
[01:09:43.956 --> 01:09:44.996]  We have the evidence.
[01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:48.097]  I mean, right down to the grassroots it's controlled.
[01:09:49.204 --> 01:09:54.514]  We have the majority view, a populist, pro-freedom, pro-liberty view.
[01:09:55.055 --> 01:09:59.743]  We can take this country back, but they control the grassroots organizations.
[01:10:00.304 --> 01:10:01.126]  So many of them.
[01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:07.794]  So here, the detail, the makeup of this is Charles Shaw.
[01:10:07.814 --> 01:10:24.365]  So Charles, let's again recap how you woke up to this, some examples at the local, individual level that was part of your wake-up as a researcher to the fact that you were right in the middle of a controlled system, expanding out then to the history of it and then modern examples.
[01:10:25.766 --> 01:10:26.046]  I think...
[01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:44.657]  I got really interested in the whole issue when I was actually examining the role of not-for-profit corporations, 501c3s, which by their very definition are not allowed to be involved in any kind of electoral politics.
[01:10:44.677 --> 01:10:49.439]  They can't lobby, they can't support campaigns and any of this stuff.
[01:10:50.197 --> 01:10:59.706]  But at the same time this is happening, right, we had United for Peace and Justice, which is probably the largest, quote, anti-war coalition in the country.
[01:10:59.726 --> 01:11:01.308]  They've got over 800 member groups.
[01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:09.155]  They spent the better part of the 2004 campaign surreptitiously campaigning for John Kerry.
[01:11:10.476 --> 01:11:24.119]  Now, I was kind of curious how they did this, and why they spent so much energy putting together demonstrations at the Republican National Convention, but barely even bothered to show up at the Democratic Convention a month earlier in Boston.
[01:11:25.219 --> 01:11:28.640]  Now, that's not 800 members, that's 800 groups.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.961]  800 groups with thousands of members, yes, across the country.
[01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:34.061]  And...
[01:11:35.569 --> 01:11:40.732]  You start to look into their organizational structure, the people that are behind it, the history of them.
[01:11:40.752 --> 01:12:02.426]  I started just doing some basic research, and that's when I pulled up Bob Feldman's article, which is, you know, the left gatekeepers and a number of different sub-articles he's done on alternative media censorship, lots of things on the Ford Foundation, George Soros, the Rockefeller Foundation, etc., etc.,
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:12.610]  So digging even deeper into that, we come up with the chart that Feldman and our friend Don Paul helped put together.
[01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:18.535]  Which kind of lays out a flow chart of some of the bigger foundations in left media.
[01:12:18.555 --> 01:12:28.743]  We're talking about the Schumann Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Soros Foundation, and then lastly the MacArthur Foundation.
[01:12:28.823 --> 01:12:41.393]  And these are the very people, the very foundations whose public policy reports, again, we've got 70 years of these, say eternal war, world government, they control the Republicans, they support them.
[01:12:41.673 --> 01:12:42.914]  It's totally staged.
[01:12:43.465 --> 01:12:44.245]  Absolutely.
[01:12:44.285 --> 01:12:46.366]  Well, I mean, you're looking at... Let's go over examples of this.
[01:12:46.627 --> 01:12:50.388]  So you start seeing this, then you're involved in the anti-war movement.
[01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.569]  You start looking around you.
[01:12:52.209 --> 01:12:52.449]  Right.
[01:12:53.170 --> 01:13:00.213]  And a number of things happened, mostly being, you know, the faltering of the anti-war movement following the Republican convention.
[01:13:01.254 --> 01:13:05.335]  The anti-war movement got co-opted up into John Kerry's campaign in the fall of 2004.
[01:13:07.152 --> 01:13:16.199]  And then immediately following the election, we launched this sustained offensive on Fallujah and just absolutely leveled the city.
[01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:21.503]  And the only person that was kind of giving us the real deal on it was an independent journalist named Dar Jamal.
[01:13:22.378 --> 01:13:38.712]  It was going on and on and on, explaining about how people were being slaughtered indiscriminately, that the city had been bombed to rubble, and that the government's countering with all of this stuff about, oh, well, it's Baptist insurgents, and it's Al-Qaeda, and it's everything but people defending their own land.
[01:13:40.213 --> 01:13:43.536]  There was nary a response to this in the anti-war movement.
[01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:47.799]  I was in San Francisco at the time, you know, the hotbed for political activism.
[01:13:47.839 --> 01:13:50.582]  We barely had 500 people come out to a demonstration.
[01:13:51.488 --> 01:13:53.749]  And I started asking, well, why isn't anybody out here?
[01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:59.993]  And what I'm getting from all the leadership of the anti-war movement is, oh, well, we're saving our energy for the counter-inaugural.
[01:14:00.013 --> 01:14:01.514]  We're all going to be in Washington, D.C.
[01:14:01.534 --> 01:14:03.855]  in January, and it's going to be bedlam.
[01:14:03.895 --> 01:14:05.376]  We're going to give Bush our mind.
[01:14:05.456 --> 01:14:13.441]  Well, you know, I went there, and I was with our good friend John Buchanan and a couple other people, and there was nobody there.
[01:14:14.181 --> 01:14:15.882]  I mean, there was barely 10,000 people in D.C.
[01:14:15.902 --> 01:14:17.163]  But there were 66,000 police and military.
[01:14:17.183 --> 01:14:17.563]  There was...
[01:14:21.653 --> 01:14:30.161]  40,000 police, from what I understand, and another, I think there was, if I remember right, 4,000 armed combat troops.
[01:14:30.281 --> 01:14:31.482]  The number is 66,000.
[01:14:31.622 --> 01:14:36.186]  Okay, yeah, and then, you know, state troops and regional and everybody that was pulled in.
[01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:37.628]  And the military was in command.
[01:14:38.288 --> 01:14:39.669]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.111]  The Washington Post, they're very proud of it.
[01:14:41.528 --> 01:14:47.350]  It was, well, you know, we had a group that we had put together to organize for it, and, you know... I'm going to enrich.
[01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:50.991]  You said this is the model for the rest of the country, the military in command of cities.
[01:14:51.691 --> 01:14:57.692]  I'd say that, and... No, he had a speech the day before the inaugural, and said what a great job they were doing.
[01:14:58.773 --> 01:15:02.734]  Well, you know, if you're playing upon people's fears, sure, they are doing a great job.
[01:15:02.754 --> 01:15:04.254]  I mean, this is a martial law drill.
[01:15:04.314 --> 01:15:10.696]  So all this is going on, you start tracking who these leaders of these movements are, where was their money coming from?
[01:15:11.866 --> 01:15:27.713]  Well, there's various foundations that have their hands in all of this, but what you've got is a lot of money coming from George Soros, who we all know is a huge moving force in the globalists.
[01:15:28.493 --> 01:15:29.514]  He's a Bilderberger.
[01:15:29.534 --> 01:15:32.415]  He was a former director of the CFR.
[01:15:32.435 --> 01:15:35.756]  He put over $100 million into the Carlyle Group.
[01:15:35.816 --> 01:15:37.477]  He is a Rothschild gopher.
[01:15:39.196 --> 01:15:41.738]  He's got his hands in the central banking system.
[01:15:41.778 --> 01:15:43.159]  He's got everything going on.
[01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:47.623]  And then he also uses quite a bit of his own money through his foundation.
[01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:50.285]  And again, this is the CFR that loves Bush.
[01:15:50.305 --> 01:15:51.946]  This is all this fake left-right system.
[01:15:52.627 --> 01:15:53.488]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:55.189]  It is a fake left-right system.
[01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:58.492]  It is divide and rule.
[01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:04.277]  And we're talking about folks like Medea Benjamin, who founded Global Exchange, and Leslie Kagan.
[01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:05.891]  We're good to go.
[01:16:26.963 --> 01:16:32.145]  Managed to completely box the anti-war debate in this anybody-but-Bush mantra.
[01:16:32.245 --> 01:16:36.286]  And they don't want us to talk about 9-11.
[01:16:37.006 --> 01:16:37.686]  Absolutely not.
[01:16:38.086 --> 01:16:39.427]  I mean, categorically not, Alex.
[01:16:39.467 --> 01:16:51.130]  I mean, I need to really make this point here, is that 500 delegates traveled across the country to their assembly in February in order to sit down and say, look, the anti-war movement is going nowhere here.
[01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:51.970]  What are we going to do?
[01:16:52.711 --> 01:16:53.551]  And these folks...
[01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:58.614]  The small cadre of people already came in with proposals that were already going to be passed.
[01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:06.438]  The 9-11 Truth folks, and there was a whole contingent of them from a diverse group of 9-11 activist organizations, they were shut out of the debate.
[01:17:06.738 --> 01:17:09.180]  They were not even allowed to present their proposal.
[01:17:10.271 --> 01:17:13.273]  This was something that... It was tacit.
[01:17:13.633 --> 01:17:14.413]  It was silent.
[01:17:14.674 --> 01:17:16.595]  It was passive-aggressive.
[01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:22.878]  They glad-handed them to their faces, and then they just completely condescended to them when they actually got up there to do something.
[01:17:22.978 --> 01:17:25.380]  And they actually empower by the way that they...
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.841]  You know, they're not victims.
[01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:53.633]  Then they all go trumpeting that instead of the anti-war movement telling the truth that globalists were behind 9-11.
[01:17:53.653 --> 01:17:54.413]  It was a pretext.
[01:17:54.433 --> 01:17:57.934]  Here's PNAC documents who invade and have a worldwide empire.
[01:17:58.274 --> 01:17:58.535]  No!
[01:17:58.835 --> 01:18:01.876]  They come out with agendas that are designed to fail!
[01:18:02.515 --> 01:18:06.819]  Well, you know, think about what would have happened if they were to pick up this mantra.
[01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:11.763]  If they were to go out there and start telling people... If you had 100,000 people nationwide marching every week saying it.
[01:18:12.204 --> 01:18:24.254]  Yeah, or more importantly, if you had 100 million people demanding that people like George Soros and the Council of Foreign Relations... Yeah, because if the left gatekeepers got on the side of exposing 9-11, it'd be over.
[01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:25.455]  Precisely.
[01:18:25.475 --> 01:18:26.977]  But it's not going to happen because they're controlled.
[01:18:27.817 --> 01:18:28.398]  Precisely.
[01:18:29.002 --> 01:18:30.383]  But I want to go into the foundations.
[01:18:30.423 --> 01:18:39.212]  I want to go into the church hearings, what we learned, the Carnegie documents we got, how these so-called leftist groups actually say, we want war, we want this.
[01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:43.336]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:43.356 --> 01:18:45.358]  By the way, Kerry wanted to invade Iran right away.
[01:18:45.378 --> 01:18:47.039]  But they didn't want to protest him.
[01:18:47.399 --> 01:18:48.561]  Oh no, Kerry will save us.
[01:18:49.261 --> 01:18:50.642]  Kerry will save us with the Patriot Act.
[01:18:50.683 --> 01:18:52.004]  He will save us, though he's for it.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.762]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[01:18:56.882 --> 01:19:00.224]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[01:19:00.364 --> 01:19:02.425]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is St.
[01:19:02.465 --> 01:19:05.306]  Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[01:19:05.446 --> 01:19:11.690]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:15.272]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[01:19:15.652 --> 01:19:21.076]  That God is merciful and forgiving, excluding no one, and that we too must show mercy and forgiveness to our neighbor.
[01:19:21.236 --> 01:19:25.139]  Christ promises to grant unimaginable favors to those that trust in his mercy.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.060]  Trust Jesus.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.542]  He will reveal his love in all aspects of your life.
[01:19:28.882 --> 01:19:33.206]  I've experienced the power of divine mercy and know the miracles that have taken place in my life.
[01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:36.248]  Christ will pour out his mercy and love to you in great abundance.
[01:19:36.508 --> 01:19:39.889]  I'll send you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about Divine Mercy.

[01:19:54.787 --> 01:19:55.828]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.148 --> 01:19:58.929]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.209 --> 01:20:03.352]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:03.792 --> 01:20:04.612]  So what do you do?
[01:20:04.932 --> 01:20:09.495]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:09.995 --> 01:20:12.117]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:12.597 --> 01:20:27.310]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:34.416]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:45.227]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:20:45.267 --> 01:20:46.328]  The Real Money Folks.
[01:21:01.235 --> 01:21:03.156]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:21:03.656 --> 01:21:04.636]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:21:04.716 --> 01:21:05.756]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:21:05.796 --> 01:21:06.136]  A 5% increase.
[01:21:06.156 --> 01:21:08.577]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:10.837]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:21:10.898 --> 01:21:12.598]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:13.498]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:21:28.735 --> 01:21:29.996]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:54.011]  Why do you wear watches?
[01:21:54.312 --> 01:21:56.874]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[01:21:57.355 --> 01:22:04.923]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[01:22:05.284 --> 01:22:09.028]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[01:22:09.488 --> 01:22:14.814]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches, discountwatchstore.com offers fine timepieces.
[01:22:15.134 --> 01:22:15.674]  We're good to go.
[01:22:35.544 --> 01:22:38.605]  Free shipping and secure transaction is standard with every order.

[01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:46.007]  That's 866-371-2330.
[01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:46.748]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:46.848 --> 01:22:47.968]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:23:05.712 --> 01:23:06.833]  We're good to go.
[01:23:06.873 --> 01:23:07.634]  We're good to go.
[01:23:26.213 --> 01:23:37.610]  Foundations with known ties to the CIA, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and even the much maligned Carlyle Group, the arms-dealing investment fund featured in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11.
[01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:41.999]  So, again, this is how they control the debate.
[01:23:42.279 --> 01:23:49.964]  And, of course, Charles Shaw has done, now that it's a two-part series on this, we'll tell you about his website in a second, is joining us.
[01:23:50.624 --> 01:24:00.150]  I got a chance to see him in New York during the demonstrations of 400,000 people that the media barely covered and tried to minimalize how many people were really there.
[01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:03.652]  He got locked up in the Guantanamo on the Hudson Pier 57.
[01:24:04.933 --> 01:24:08.575]  Of course, I was there videotaping it across the street and threatened with arrest there as well.
[01:24:09.016 --> 01:24:17.821]  So we'll tell you that story too, but let's get into the Carnegie Rockefeller Brothers, the Ford Foundation, because we've got their documents.
[01:24:17.841 --> 01:24:19.202]  It's come out in Congressional Test 24.
[01:24:19.242 --> 01:24:27.047]  They actually push for war, but then also fund the anti-war movement to make sure it fails and to make sure it looks stupid and says horrible things.
[01:24:27.836 --> 01:24:39.148]  Well, we know they hired thugs in the 60s to go break windows in towns so the police would then have the pretext to go attack the peaceful anti-war people to make it look good for the pro-war people.
[01:24:40.049 --> 01:24:43.092]  We know that a lot of these anarchists are hired by them today.
[01:24:43.152 --> 01:24:46.595]  We've proven that these left foundations funded right before the...
[01:24:47.808 --> 01:24:50.710]  Situation in Seattle in 99 that I cover in The Takeover.
[01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:56.273]  They trained them, hired them, the police were not to arrest them, they housed them in a government building.
[01:24:56.813 --> 01:25:00.295]  We have all this on video, and the police were then ordered to attack the peaceful protesters.
[01:25:00.315 --> 01:25:06.699]  So it's the same system over and over again, and so many well-meaning leftist bleeding hearts.
[01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:07.719]  All right.
[01:25:07.739 --> 01:25:11.241]  Well, you know, there's a really telling quote from the Chicago Tribune back in 1950.
[01:25:11.381 --> 01:25:14.622]  And they were doing a story on the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:16.182]  And, you know, they said, quote...
[01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:41.097]  The members have used their prestige, that their wealth, their social position, and their education have given them to lead the country towards bankruptcy and military debacle.
[01:25:41.497 --> 01:25:42.818]  They should look at their hands.
[01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:44.058]  There is blood on them.
[01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:50.301]  The dried blood of the last war, referring to World War II, and the fresh blood of the present one, referring to Korea.
[01:25:51.002 --> 01:25:53.603]  You know, we know Roosevelt was a member of the CFR.
[01:25:54.403 --> 01:25:57.385]  We know that it was Roosevelt who got us into World War II.
[01:25:59.068 --> 01:26:05.086]  These groups have continued to shape policy by flooding money down... These groups funded Hitler!
[01:26:06.644 --> 01:26:07.644]  They funded Stalin.
[01:26:07.664 --> 01:26:13.086]  They funded Lenin before when it was just the Royal Institute of International Affairs in England.
[01:26:13.526 --> 01:26:14.827]  I mean, it's the same M.O.
[01:26:14.847 --> 01:26:15.207]  Go ahead.
[01:26:15.687 --> 01:26:16.707]  They funded Saddam.
[01:26:16.747 --> 01:26:17.788]  They funded Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:17.968 --> 01:26:18.528]  Go ahead.
[01:26:18.868 --> 01:26:22.609]  You've got the central bankers, the Rothschilds, what have you.
[01:26:22.689 --> 01:26:25.690]  You've got them funding both sides of the capitalist communist side.
[01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:27.531]  You've got them funding and creating Hitler.
[01:26:27.571 --> 01:26:33.113]  But more importantly, you've got our own people, namely the Bush family, funding the rise of the Third Reich as well.
[01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:46.874]  There's a lot of material out there on the business dealings between Prescott Bush, George Herbert Walker, A. Avril Harriman, who was their boss, and a guy named Fritz Tissen, who was a Nazi industrialist.
[01:26:46.894 --> 01:26:48.477]  Yeah, there's a new film out about that.
[01:26:49.233 --> 01:26:49.474]  Right.
[01:26:49.714 --> 01:26:55.341]  Well, this is something that our friend John Buchanan went and he went to the National Archives.
[01:26:55.381 --> 01:27:02.150]  He got the official documents from our own government that showed how Prescott Bush and his ilk were profiting.
[01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:05.855]  Well, I have articles from 42 and major newspapers with Prescott Bush in there.
[01:27:06.275 --> 01:27:08.696]  Alright, so you've got all the Trading with the Enemy Act stuff.
[01:27:08.796 --> 01:27:14.477]  Yeah, I mean, this stuff, here comes John, he says, okay, we've got real documents, you guys want to get the Bush family, let's go.
[01:27:14.698 --> 01:27:15.598]  Here's my story.
[01:27:15.998 --> 01:27:21.800]  Not even the left media, not even the purported Bush haters would touch the story.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500]  The London Guardian did pick it up, though.
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.061]  They did, but they only picked it up about a year later.
[01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:28.762]  And it was, you know, it was ex post facto.
[01:27:28.822 --> 01:27:30.002]  Yeah, it was after the election.
[01:27:31.152 --> 01:27:34.895]  You know, but there's a book out there by Charles Hingham called Trading with the Enemy.
[01:27:35.335 --> 01:27:52.547]  It has a lot to do with the stuff we're talking about, but it also documents how, you know, the Rockefellers, through Standard Oil and Ford, through Ford Motors, they made a hell of a lot of money selling oil, tanks, and steel to the Nazis, even during wartime.
[01:27:52.968 --> 01:27:59.112]  You know, during the Allied bombing of Germany, one of the only places that was spared was the Ford Motor Plant in Cologne.
[01:28:00.123 --> 01:28:09.269]  And you have these incredibly powerful... Understand, folks, our troops are dying on beaches, but the B-17s can't bomb the Ford TOEFL plants.
[01:28:09.809 --> 01:28:10.530]  TOEFL plants.
[01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:20.536]  So you've got all of this going on, and all of this is to say that these parent companies of these foundations, the Standard Oil, which became Anaco...
[01:28:21.181 --> 01:28:28.823]  The Ford Motors and General Motors and, of course, General Electric, all of these companies were part of the military-industrial complex.
[01:28:28.963 --> 01:28:32.344]  And they own the left gatekeepers, and we're going to document that when we get back.
[01:28:32.424 --> 01:28:33.084]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:28:33.104 --> 01:28:36.405]  They take money from the foundations that then push the war with their other hand.
[01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:38.865]  It's unbelievable.
[01:28:39.725 --> 01:28:40.586]  Cracking the code.
[01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:41.246]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.746 --> 01:28:44.647]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.147 --> 01:28:46.767]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.667 --> 01:28:50.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.040]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.221]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:28:57.421 --> 01:28:58.121]  Prepare yourself.
[01:28:58.281 --> 01:29:01.981]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[01:30:04.341 --> 01:30:08.642]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:08.982 --> 01:30:12.003]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.303 --> 01:30:15.744]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:16.064 --> 01:30:25.435]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:29.199]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:31:00.918 --> 01:31:05.462]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.582 --> 01:31:12.429]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.789 --> 01:31:18.915]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.055 --> 01:31:20.256]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.436 --> 01:31:20.917]  We're good to go.

[01:32:13.233 --> 01:32:15.895]  back from 9 to midnight, all-time central standard.
[01:32:16.695 --> 01:32:22.139]  Again, going out on a wonderful list of AM and FM affiliates across the country, a growing list.
[01:32:22.539 --> 01:32:28.323]  Simulcasting on the Internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985.
[01:32:28.363 --> 01:32:29.924]  First two hours, 9.75.
[01:32:37.398 --> 01:32:39.500]  In the third hour and at night at 3210.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:33:06.582]  Before we go back to Charles Shaw, the third hour of my three-hour film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, covers Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the elite, the Council on Foreign Relations, how all these groups tie together, how they control the left and right, how it ties in with the Nazis and the Bushes and history, and what their master plan is.
[01:33:07.657 --> 01:33:08.438]  Schwarzenegger.
[01:33:08.578 --> 01:33:08.938]  All of it.
[01:33:09.698 --> 01:33:11.200]  That's the third hour of the film.
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:18.164]  A full hour is the most cohesive, focused information out there, bar none, on 9-11.
[01:33:19.685 --> 01:33:23.208]  The controlled demolition of the towers, just the whole 9-11 story.
[01:33:23.248 --> 01:33:23.868]  It's right there.
[01:33:25.329 --> 01:33:28.091]  All the documented, provable, demonstrable information.
[01:33:30.413 --> 01:33:35.256]  No one, after watching this, would not wake up and say, clearly the globalists are behind this.
[01:33:35.296 --> 01:33:36.677]  In the first 35 minutes or so,
[01:33:37.855 --> 01:33:40.697]  Is about just the police state in New York itself.
[01:33:41.858 --> 01:33:44.159]  That's going to be exported nationwide and worldwide.
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.361]  The new film is $24.95.
[01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:49.023]  Get multiple copies for as low as $14 a piece.
[01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:53.986]  I've got some of my other great films as low as $5.95 when you buy one copy at the regular price.
[01:33:54.406 --> 01:33:56.988]  I've got a free tape special that you then save $18 on.
[01:33:57.348 --> 01:33:58.429]  A bunch of different specials.
[01:33:58.469 --> 01:34:02.731]  Just peruse the specials at Infowars.com on the Safe Secure Shopping Cart.
[01:34:03.072 --> 01:34:04.372]  Watch free clips of the films.
[01:34:04.733 --> 01:34:06.754]  In some cases I've got half the film up for free.
[01:34:07.731 --> 01:34:10.874]  Got about half of American Dictators up for free.
[01:34:11.735 --> 01:34:14.798]  It's about an hour and a half up for free of martial law.
[01:34:15.478 --> 01:34:18.982]  And if that's all you want, download free copies of that and burn it on disk and give it to people.
[01:34:19.402 --> 01:34:21.384]  Bottom line, get the information out.
[01:34:21.784 --> 01:34:22.765]  This needs to be seen.
[01:34:23.166 --> 01:34:25.548]  Download it, put it on more file sharing networks.
[01:34:25.588 --> 01:34:26.729]  Don't count others to do it.
[01:34:28.337 --> 01:34:31.198]  I mean, there's sneaky ways to get people to watch it, too, and wake them up.
[01:34:31.238 --> 01:34:32.339]  I mean, I've been talking about this.
[01:34:32.399 --> 01:34:39.362]  Just name it Star Wars Revenge of the Sith when you put it on a file sharing network, and millions will watch it.
[01:34:39.662 --> 01:34:41.383]  People did that before Fahrenheit came out.
[01:34:41.423 --> 01:34:42.923]  They named Road to Tyranny.
[01:34:43.164 --> 01:34:44.964]  I never thought of this until some listener did it.
[01:34:45.345 --> 01:34:49.646]  They named Road to Tyranny Fahrenheit 9-11, and millions of people went and watched it, folks.
[01:34:50.147 --> 01:34:55.369]  So there's guerrilla warfare info tactics you can use, and I'm telling you about tactics we've learned.
[01:34:56.596 --> 01:35:10.404]  If you want to watch it all online, high bandwidth, low bandwidth, read my book, Paul Watson's book, weekly TV shows, special reports, hundreds of audio interviews, all my films, dozens of other films, prisonplanet.tv, monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day.
[01:35:10.444 --> 01:35:10.844]  Don't wait.
[01:35:11.104 --> 01:35:12.345]  Pull a free number to get the films.
[01:35:12.565 --> 01:35:13.745]  They can answer your questions when you call.
[01:35:13.766 --> 01:35:14.466]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:14.486 --> 01:35:14.526]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:14.546 --> 01:35:15.787]  I know the phones have loaded up.
[01:35:26.417 --> 01:35:27.377]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:35:27.658 --> 01:35:30.359]  We'll go to your calls here in a little while.
[01:35:30.899 --> 01:35:33.720]  Charles Shaw, for those that just joined us, tell us about your website.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.801]  Website is Newtopia Magazine.
[01:35:37.062 --> 01:35:41.643]  The URL is newtopiamagazine.com.net or .org.
[01:35:42.364 --> 01:35:44.525]  N-E-W-T-O-P-I-A.
[01:35:45.085 --> 01:35:47.846]  We bill ourselves as a journal of the new counterculture.
[01:35:48.806 --> 01:35:52.208]  We like to report on the history...
[01:35:53.098 --> 01:35:59.764]  Social movement, politics, art, culture, what have you, is moved out of the mainstream.
[01:36:02.446 --> 01:36:03.487]  Well, that's important.
[01:36:03.687 --> 01:36:08.031]  Now, Charles, let's continue with a little bit more of the history, and then we'll start going to calls.
[01:36:08.051 --> 01:36:10.233]  I mean, we have the congressional documents.
[01:36:10.253 --> 01:36:10.854]  We have it all.
[01:36:11.214 --> 01:36:17.660]  We know that Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller and all these groups, while they're funding open borders and the takeover of the country, while they're...
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:18.920]  That's correct.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:24.842]  There was something that came out last week by Robert Perry, who is another journalist who had this career slash for looking into the wrong corners.
[01:36:24.902 --> 01:36:28.243]  On Consortium News, he puts something out about the rise of right media.
[01:36:48.855 --> 01:37:06.859]  And he correctly identifies that after the Vietnam War movement kind of dissipated in the mid-70s, the left decided to kind of abandon media and they went into this whole not-for-profit grassroots organizing structure.
[01:37:07.409 --> 01:37:18.072]  Well, you know, first of all, the irony of trying to oppose a system which you then have to go in and allow yourself to be regulated by, as the government regulates, not for profits.
[01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.512]  And it's the same with our churches.
[01:37:19.552 --> 01:37:22.233]  In the past, churches didn't pay taxes because of the First Amendment.
[01:37:22.513 --> 01:37:28.174]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:30.015]  So they're all out preaching pro-war.
[01:37:30.695 --> 01:37:35.419]  Right, but the thing that people aren't really recognizing is that
[01:37:51.412 --> 01:37:55.735]  And that's why the arguments are so mindless and childish, because it's not even real.
[01:37:55.795 --> 01:37:56.595]  It's WWF wrestling.
[01:38:17.863 --> 01:38:21.086]  Or more importantly, it's partisan politicking.
[01:38:21.207 --> 01:38:23.409]  It's like the WWF owns the contracts.
[01:38:24.453 --> 01:38:29.096]  On the managers of both wrestlers that are having their staged fight.
[01:38:29.617 --> 01:38:29.857]  Right.
[01:38:30.177 --> 01:38:31.718]  And don't really hurt each other.
[01:38:31.738 --> 01:38:34.740]  Just kind of get in there and make it look good and say all the right things.
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:40.824]  Well, this never got more obvious than Kerry's cousins on every side of his family with Bush, two years apart at Skull and Bones.
[01:38:41.084 --> 01:38:42.005]  He's for the war.
[01:38:42.065 --> 01:38:43.186]  He's for the Patriot Act.
[01:38:43.486 --> 01:38:44.587]  He's for open borders.
[01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:45.567]  He's for everything.
[01:38:46.008 --> 01:38:51.071]  And I can have arguments with moron leftists who think he was actually against it all.
[01:38:51.431 --> 01:38:51.691]  I know.
[01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:55.074]  It's really, Alex, I can't even begin to try to explain that.
[01:38:55.694 --> 01:39:03.200]  The level of denial and obtuseness as far as these people thinking that there was any substantial difference between these guys absolutely boggles my mind.
[01:39:03.541 --> 01:39:08.424]  And I think what it really comes down to is that there is a belief within certain, you know,
[01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:15.106]  Particularly a group that calls themselves the Progressive Democrats of America.
[01:39:15.146 --> 01:39:21.091]  I happen to think that's an oxymoron, but, you know, they happen to think that they are not, quote, the Democratic Party.
[01:39:21.492 --> 01:39:25.255]  Peter Cameo said, well, that's like saying that the Panama Canal is not Panama.
[01:39:25.836 --> 01:39:31.440]  But nonetheless, you have them out there, and they're saying, well, John Kerry doesn't represent the Democratic Party.
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.040]  We do.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:32.921]  The people do.
[01:39:33.041 --> 01:39:35.422]  And the rank and file is against the war.
[01:39:35.943 --> 01:39:47.871]  Well, if the rank and file is against the war, then again, we have to keep asking them, why are they signing off on these Democratic leaders that are, without any kind of debate and without any kind of challenge...
[01:39:48.331 --> 01:39:56.578]  Giving the Bush administration every dollar they want to go over there and range across the world and expand this empire.
[01:39:56.698 --> 01:39:58.239]  Well, I mean, where are the Democrats now?
[01:39:58.279 --> 01:40:07.186]  They're not harping on the admission there were no WMDs, the admission that they lied about it, all of this, the incredible frauds and scams that are going on.
[01:40:07.206 --> 01:40:09.428]  That's all basically a dead issue.
[01:40:09.468 --> 01:40:11.910]  It's just, yeah, they lied to us, and now they're going to attack Iran.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:21.864]  And some of the rhetoric coming out of the so-called Democratic leaders about Iran and about Syria and about North Korea is really frightening.
[01:40:23.225 --> 01:40:32.149]  They want to go and pigeonhole the neocons as being hawks and imperialists, but this is a bipartisan policy, and it's very much so.
[01:40:32.825 --> 01:40:40.327]  It's political suicide for any politician, Democrat or Republican, to challenge this Leviathan defense budget.
[01:40:40.887 --> 01:40:45.708]  But we've been, you know, bilking the people out of half a trillion dollars a year, and that's just what's on the book.
[01:40:45.788 --> 01:40:49.189]  Well, it's $600 billion this year, and then there's hundreds of billions off budget.
[01:40:49.749 --> 01:40:52.610]  Plus, Iraq has already cost us $200 billion.
[01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:59.132]  Plus, you've got to talk about another few hundred million that are thrown into the so-called war on drugs.
[01:40:59.771 --> 01:41:10.338]  And that's because you go after their competition and also grab the kids that were dumb enough to use the CIA narcotics and put them in these privately owned prisons working for 20 cents an hour.
[01:41:10.878 --> 01:41:11.139]  Right.
[01:41:11.259 --> 01:41:15.922]  Well, we could go on for a whole other hour talking about the prison profits.
[01:41:16.522 --> 01:41:20.585]  I live in Chicago and you're talking about how New York is exporting this
[01:41:21.104 --> 01:41:22.305]  Right, and it's all networked.
[01:41:47.552 --> 01:42:00.422]  And we've got our own fair share of illegal immigrant problems here, and they're using this as a pretext to kind of sturm and drang through all the neighborhoods.
[01:42:01.362 --> 01:42:05.526]  Anything even resembling Fourth Amendment protection rights in Chicago is right out the window.
[01:42:05.546 --> 01:42:07.967]  And you have a mafia dynasty running your city.
[01:42:08.928 --> 01:42:09.388]  Yeah.
[01:42:09.469 --> 01:42:12.451]  Does the mafia want to keep control of its slaves and take their guns?
[01:42:12.491 --> 01:42:13.071]  Of course they do.
[01:42:13.331 --> 01:42:14.092]  That's another thing.
[01:42:14.292 --> 01:42:16.654]  That's another thing, Charles Shaw.
[01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:27.106]  The left loves to wear Che Guevara shirts with him with an AK-47, but when the citizens of America want to have guns to defend themselves against tyranny, oh, it's suddenly bad.
[01:42:27.126 --> 01:42:31.070]  Now I'm talking to so many people who were, quote, leftists who've woken up.
[01:42:31.110 --> 01:42:32.832]  They're now going out and buying firearms.
[01:42:32.872 --> 01:42:33.213]  Comments?
[01:42:33.988 --> 01:42:35.349]  I'll do you one better.
[01:42:35.489 --> 01:42:37.529]  First, they don't understand the issue.
[01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:45.272]  And they have to first recognize that their government is the threat before they can recognize that they need to protect themselves from the government.
[01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:46.813]  So I'm behind you on that one.
[01:42:47.133 --> 01:42:53.075]  And I understand the push to remove the Second Amendment from American people's lives.
[01:42:53.175 --> 01:42:59.018]  But the problem with that is that the left still thinks that they somehow can affect things through the legislative process.
[01:42:59.338 --> 01:43:02.439]  They still seem to think that the legislative process isn't
[01:43:02.779 --> 01:43:03.660]  Completely corrupt.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:08.024]  The President's Attorney General has said he's above the law and they can torture people to death.
[01:43:08.464 --> 01:43:09.766]  And who is there to stop them?
[01:43:09.806 --> 01:43:10.927]  And that's really the problem.
[01:43:11.167 --> 01:43:12.408]  I want to go back just a second.
[01:43:12.428 --> 01:43:15.631]  You're talking about Che Guevara and the idea of the revolution.
[01:43:15.691 --> 01:43:21.797]  So many of these older Vietnam-era people who are now purported leaders in the anti-war movement...
[01:43:22.157 --> 01:43:27.580]  These folks were all radical socialists and communists in the 60s and 70s.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:35.084]  And I'm not necessarily saying that that's a bad thing, because, again, I firmly believe that the whole left-right dichotomy is a complete illusion.
[01:43:35.464 --> 01:43:40.427]  So whatever you subscribe to, the bottom line is they were advocating for revolution pretty strongly.
[01:43:40.827 --> 01:43:44.129]  And then here we come into this assembly that they had in February.
[01:43:44.369 --> 01:43:48.571]  We're trying to come up with new plans to stop the war and to stop the empire.
[01:43:49.152 --> 01:43:52.041]  And we're talking about taking much more dramatic stances.
[01:43:53.251 --> 01:44:00.834]  Even minor rhetoric like an overthrow of our government, even by non-violent means, has been censored out of the debate.
[01:44:00.894 --> 01:44:01.915]  Yeah, even impeachment.
[01:44:02.935 --> 01:44:04.115]  Now, let's stop right there.
[01:44:04.135 --> 01:44:16.501]  Now, again, my analogy is, when it's a fake communist revolution or a commie gun, these guys go, well, we love it, it's good, but then for a citizen of America to have a gun, it's bad.
[01:44:16.541 --> 01:44:19.862]  That shows the schizophrenia of these people.
[01:44:21.623 --> 01:44:26.567]  And you show these phony leftists that the Carnegie and Rockefeller and Ford Foundation funded communists.
[01:44:26.968 --> 01:44:42.320]  You show them that it was funded as a way to get people back into serfdom, to be a bogeyman so they could turn the West into a police state, and have the communists go grab and murder resources all over the world and hand it over to the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation with oil companies in Russia 50 years ago.
[01:44:43.021 --> 01:44:44.962]  Armand Hammer, the communist leader, also...
[01:44:46.084 --> 01:44:50.873]  It's all a scam, and you show them the documents, and they don't want to see it, Charles.
[01:44:51.294 --> 01:44:51.975]  No, they don't.
[01:44:52.115 --> 01:44:55.541]  They really don't, because it's a matter of... You've got these...
[01:44:56.158 --> 01:44:56.939]  Not for products.
[01:44:57.039 --> 01:44:57.599]  NGOs.
[01:44:57.739 --> 01:45:10.867]  And so they've all got budgets and they've got careers and they like to hang out with Michael Moore and Sean Penn and they like to go on the speaking circuit and they like to act as if they are somehow holier than all of us common working people.
[01:45:11.367 --> 01:45:12.648]  And they don't want to give that up.
[01:45:13.089 --> 01:45:18.512]  I mean, if you want to talk about the greatest drug that's plaguing our culture, it's the idea of celebrity and status.
[01:45:19.016 --> 01:45:22.497]  You've got Michael Moore, who, you know, look what he did in bowling for Columbine.
[01:45:23.178 --> 01:45:36.683]  You know, the right to bear arms was suddenly boiled down to a couple absolute kooks and a few, you know, fringe militia groups that, you know, perhaps had, you know... Well, here's the good news, Charles.
[01:45:36.703 --> 01:45:37.743]  Charles, here's the good news.
[01:45:40.209 --> 01:45:57.814]  Everybody I talk to who 10 years ago would come to one of our gun rallies and scream and yell at us, they're now walking up apologizing saying, I just bought a semi-automatic AK-47, and I know that communism is controlled, and I know the left is controlled, and I know that the New World Order controls it, and I'm for true freedom.
[01:45:58.915 --> 01:46:04.098]  And I see conservatives waking up that the Republicans are a fraud and that it's all command and control.
[01:46:04.519 --> 01:46:14.366]  So just like newspaper circulation is down 65% and TV is down 35% to 45% or 37% to 45%, people are leaving.
[01:46:15.126 --> 01:46:18.709]  I see people basically know this phony leftist phony.
[01:46:18.989 --> 01:46:22.191]  That's why folks aren't showing up at their rallies anymore because they know it's a fraud.
[01:46:22.471 --> 01:46:24.373]  So what I'm telling you is I think...
[01:46:24.933 --> 01:46:33.880]  That the deprogramming has begun and we have a real, spontaneous, populist movement that scares the New World Order to death.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.561]  I agree with you, Alex.
[01:46:35.662 --> 01:46:39.965]  And the funny thing about it is that it took a little bit longer to get off the ground than we all thought.
[01:46:40.501 --> 01:46:50.363]  You know, there's people like Mike Rupert who, you know, very, very soon after the election went very public in saying that, you know, 9-11 is dead, anti-war is dead.
[01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:52.204]  You had your chance and you blew it.
[01:46:52.404 --> 01:46:54.944]  The only chance we had was to remove Bush.
[01:46:55.104 --> 01:47:03.726]  And Moore told us Bush was legitimate on the Late Show or Tonight Show with a pumpkin head.
[01:47:03.766 --> 01:47:04.266]  What's his name?
[01:47:04.286 --> 01:47:04.826]  Jay Leno.
[01:47:05.346 --> 01:47:06.967]  So, wow, the same rhetoric.
[01:47:07.007 --> 01:47:07.627]  Very interesting.
[01:47:07.947 --> 01:47:15.248]  Yeah, I mean, first of all, we could spend another hour talking about how they not only stole the 2000 election, but also stole the 2004 election.
[01:47:15.268 --> 01:47:17.729]  You can't just steal 04 at the voting box.
[01:47:17.749 --> 01:47:20.049]  You've got to have a rigged candidate who'll take the dive.
[01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:26.731]  You take a rigged candidate, and then you've got, you know, Ken Blackwell, who is the Catherine Harris, you know, of 2004.
[01:47:26.771 --> 01:47:28.391]  Yeah, there's so much evidence it's ridiculous.
[01:47:28.431 --> 01:47:32.832]  John Kerry won the election, and we're not saying that's even good, because he was staged to begin with.
[01:47:33.232 --> 01:47:33.472]  Right.
[01:47:33.572 --> 01:47:37.495]  I mean, that was the fastest concession speech I had ever seen in my life.
[01:47:37.575 --> 01:47:43.879]  Before the votes were even counted, he was bowing out, and he didn't even show up in public again for another five weeks.
[01:47:44.259 --> 01:47:48.382]  And somehow you want to tell me that this was the guy who really wanted to be president?
[01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:55.407]  I think when you're talking about guys like Michael Moore, though, really, Alex, the issue is that how can a guy who is worth $200 million...
[01:47:57.409 --> 01:48:04.116]  How can people who are barely surviving on $30,000 a year identify him as in the same category?
[01:48:04.156 --> 01:48:06.618]  Well, he's flying around on a Disney jet.
[01:48:07.199 --> 01:48:10.962]  And then Disney puts on that act like they might not distribute it to hype it up.
[01:48:11.763 --> 01:48:17.809]  Yeah, well, if you want my personal opinion on all that, it was just merely media stunts to get people hyped.
[01:48:17.829 --> 01:48:21.453]  Well, at the end of the film, he goes, we need more police, we need more funding.
[01:48:22.023 --> 01:48:22.263]  Yeah.
[01:48:22.744 --> 01:48:23.524]  Yeah.
[01:48:23.665 --> 01:48:24.605]  It's really scary.
[01:48:24.966 --> 01:48:29.350]  And, you know, there are people out there that want to claim that the police state isn't happening.
[01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:36.236]  And, you know, I think really it's because people have this concept in their minds of what it's supposed to look like and what it's supposed to sound like.
[01:48:36.736 --> 01:48:39.339]  And they don't understand that it's very surreptitious.
[01:48:39.719 --> 01:48:45.821]  You know, they don't have to be out there wearing, you know, identical uniforms with swastikas on their shoulder to show that there's police state.
[01:48:45.981 --> 01:48:48.942]  Here in Chicago, the bulk of the police do not wear uniforms.
[01:48:49.183 --> 01:48:51.924]  They're federally funded tactical squad guys.
[01:48:52.064 --> 01:48:53.884]  And that is pure police state.
[01:48:54.004 --> 01:48:55.585]  Not wearing uniform is the worst.
[01:48:56.085 --> 01:48:56.686]  Absolutely.
[01:48:56.966 --> 01:49:02.431]  And they are there, and they will pull up on you and stop you and take you in without even a blink.
[01:49:02.511 --> 01:49:12.540]  Well, millions of cameras, millions of microphones, whole towns, face scanning, transponders will be on all the cars, every major road, a toll road, giant prisons being built everywhere.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:13.701]  And it's quiet.
[01:49:14.462 --> 01:49:14.942]  It's quiet.
[01:49:15.002 --> 01:49:18.105]  It's surreptitious, and it's kind of creeping up on us.
[01:49:18.786 --> 01:49:26.359]  You know, it's the old adage, if you toss a frog into a pot of water and slowly bring it to a boil, it's not going to realize that it's frying.
[01:49:27.241 --> 01:49:27.541]  You know?
[01:49:27.982 --> 01:49:29.284]  That's what we've got going on here.
[01:49:29.484 --> 01:49:30.546]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:49:30.606 --> 01:49:32.610]  Well, I'll tell you why the gun grabbers are in trouble.
[01:49:33.443 --> 01:49:41.146]  Is because the so-called left is being deprogrammed, but then we can count on George Bush and Alberto Gonzalez and Governor Pataki and Governor Schwarzenegger.
[01:49:41.406 --> 01:49:47.168]  It's all the Republicans coming after our guns, and the controlled right media won't tell you, the conservatives, that.
[01:49:47.388 --> 01:49:50.229]  Just like the controlled left media won't tell you anything, leftists.
[01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:51.210]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:51.230 --> 01:49:51.670]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.331 --> 01:49:57.212]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.919 --> 01:49:59.221]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:53:05.625 --> 01:53:13.513]  I should have asked you this during the break, but Charles Shaw from Newtopia Magazine, are you willing to stay with us into the next hour?
[01:53:13.974 --> 01:53:14.234]  Sure.
[01:53:15.242 --> 01:53:16.002]  All right, let's do it.
[01:53:16.443 --> 01:53:17.003]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:53:17.203 --> 01:53:19.184]  Let's go to some callers here.
[01:53:20.125 --> 01:53:23.567]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Ohio first.
[01:53:23.587 --> 01:53:24.147]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:53:24.167 --> 01:53:25.027]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:53:25.167 --> 01:53:25.928]  Good, thanks for holding.
[01:53:26.168 --> 01:53:27.028]  All right, no problem.
[01:53:27.048 --> 01:53:31.311]  First of all, I think it's a great show that you have about this left-pony paradigm.
[01:53:32.471 --> 01:53:33.292]  I have a question.
[01:53:33.952 --> 01:53:39.315]  We tend to make fun of the media because of the fact that there's so much censorship involved in that.
[01:53:39.835 --> 01:53:44.518]  And I think that one of the things we need to do in the alternative media is we've got to come together
[01:53:45.299 --> 01:53:47.440]  And put these grievances behind us.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:47.940]  I agree.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.460]  Thank you for the call, Steve.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:50.681]  Really appreciate that.
[01:53:51.301 --> 01:53:53.541]  But let's explain what this means.
[01:53:53.861 --> 01:53:57.682]  Let's explain what censorship means, specifically.
[01:53:58.403 --> 01:54:13.967]  If I run a website, say Infowars.com, and I see articles we've posted that I think do not cover the views that I have and the mission that I have, then I have a choice whether I want to carry that or not.
[01:54:15.425 --> 01:54:18.527]  Now, I also have my own choice.
[01:54:20.588 --> 01:54:25.791]  Let's say I do want to have an Ann Coulter on, then I'm going to disagree with her, but I'm going to decide what I'm going to do.
[01:54:26.071 --> 01:54:40.119]  Now, a real example of censorship, for those that get confused with the term, for people that don't understand this, is Italian website banned over Nazi Pope pictures.
[01:54:40.811 --> 01:54:42.394]  Now, this is their website.
[01:54:42.414 --> 01:54:45.761]  This is Indy Media with its servers based in Brazil.
[01:54:46.915 --> 01:54:57.297]  Nothing to do with Italy, where they have fascistic Nazi mind-control laws, which you all thought were okay if somebody said, you know, six million Jews didn't die.
[01:54:57.337 --> 01:54:58.798]  Well, they shouldn't be able to say that.
[01:54:58.838 --> 01:55:03.679]  But see, now it's don't show Ratzinger in a Nazi uniform, which he did indeed wear.
[01:55:04.179 --> 01:55:10.800]  Okay, so see now, that's censorship to go to someone's website and to tell them, take your website down.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.421]  Censorship is if I go up to you with your sandwich board...
[01:55:15.181 --> 01:55:23.685]  And tell you you can't stand on the street corner, what Bush is doing, arresting anti-war demonstrators when 500 pro-Bushers are allowed to stand on the same sidewalk.
[01:55:24.085 --> 01:55:25.826]  That is censorship.
[01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:33.309]  Censorship is not saying, Alex, because you won't put pornos on your website, you're censoring.
[01:55:33.949 --> 01:55:36.610]  Would you like to comment on censorship, Charles?
[01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:37.930]  Absolutely.
[01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:43.733]  The other thing that I think is even more insidious than that, Alex, is this idea of self...
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:47.021]  And covert censorship.
[01:55:47.982 --> 01:55:58.568]  One of the best examples of this is when Amy Goodman had been bugged and bugged and bugged for a year to try to put David Ray Griffin on her show to talk about the new Pearl Harbor.
[01:55:58.588 --> 01:56:02.470]  And at the last second, she ends up bringing in Chip Burleigh.
[01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:04.972]  Chip Burleigh doesn't know anything about 9-11 research.
[01:56:05.572 --> 01:56:09.194]  He's made his career as a, quote, anti-conspiracist.
[01:56:09.981 --> 01:56:15.944]  And you come to find out that the Ford Foundation has been giving a lot of money to Democracy Now!
[01:56:16.044 --> 01:56:25.528]  and specifically gave them a grant in early 2002 to continue reporting on 9-11, the aftermath of 9-11.
[01:56:25.748 --> 01:56:29.389]  Now, there's the payoff right there, but let's expand.
[01:56:29.409 --> 01:56:30.850]  David Ray Griffin had him on yesterday.
[01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:31.770]  I think his books are great.
[01:56:31.810 --> 01:56:33.091]  I've read one, got the other.
[01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:42.303]  He's got all these CFR people riding his forward that he's involved with, and I predicted three years ago that the globalists would give us a phony left movement.
[01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:50.895]  To let go, oh, a liberal world government is the answer to the evil right-wing government when it's all run by the same people, and that's exactly what Griffin was saying yesterday.
[01:56:51.435 --> 01:56:52.436]  Right.
[01:56:52.836 --> 01:57:00.281]  I think that any time there's an opportunity to try to co-opt a movement or to take it over or to fill it with disinformation, it's going to be done.
[01:57:00.601 --> 01:57:07.906]  These folks have a tremendous amount of access, a tremendous amount of power, and regardless, they are going to try to stop it.
[01:57:08.413 --> 01:57:15.680]  You know, like, with the Ford Foundation, they don't have to come to Amy Goodman and say, all right, listen, now you cannot report on any of this stuff.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:25.849]  What they'll just say is, here, make sure you do something about the aftermath of 9-11, and then they'll dangle enough money there that they know how hard it is to keep that grant funding year after year after year.
[01:57:25.869 --> 01:57:28.271]  And then they get a call going, here, you're doing a show on this.
[01:57:28.331 --> 01:57:29.893]  We've got a guest for you.
[01:57:30.653 --> 01:57:32.275]  Would you like to talk to us?
[01:57:33.486 --> 01:57:38.711]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll talk to Roger and Manuel and many, many others on the other side.
[01:57:38.771 --> 01:57:39.732]  Third hour straight ahead.
