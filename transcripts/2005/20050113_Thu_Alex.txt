[00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:06.196]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:07.937]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:09.739]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.220]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:12.882]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:17.186]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:21.790]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.285]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:41.186]  Here we are.
[00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:46.510]  It's already Thursday, the 13th day of January, 2005.
[00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.912]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.992 --> 00:01:04.962]  Colonel Craig Roberts will be joining us in the second hour to talk about the police state, the new freedom initiative, to discuss the national ID card, to talk about the new year-round census we'll all be living under.
[00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:30.893]  But he'll also be joining us to talk about the report we covered with Pat Shannon yesterday with this top BATF officer, the individual who was over the National Security Council program of testing truck bombs and car bombs out in the New Mexico desert in the year before the Oklahoma City tragedy on April 19, 1995, who was then on the ground
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.561]  As the blast went off in Oklahoma City.
[00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.362]  He didn't live in Oklahoma City, boys and girls.
[00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:59.208]  Then, of course, Danny Colson, one of the high-level FBI agents over an entire department sector of the FBI, this guy claimed he was in Dallas the day of the event, but it turns out he was there the day before.
[00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:04.246]  The night before in Oklahoma City.
[00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:09.508]  I mean, this is important because Oklahoma City was really sloppily done.
[00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:14.309]  And it wasn't as sophisticated as the government terror attack of 9-11.
[00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:23.132]  And we can really prove that they, that is our loving government that's taking all our freedoms, were intimately involved in it.
[00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:25.773]  And Craig Roberts is a real expert on it.
[00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:29.874]  He even worked the case as a police officer there in Oklahoma.
[00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:36.068]  So, Colonel Roberts joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:37.748]  I do want to take your phone calls.
[00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.110]  Didn't get to a lot of them yesterday because I had three great guests on.
[00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.891]  But we'll take a lot of your calls in this first hour.
[00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:44.471]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:44.591]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.393]  I might even go to some calls in the next segment.
[00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:49.513]  Uncle Sam wants your data all year round.
[00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:52.054]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:13.551]  I probably see, when I'm scanning the news wires at night, when I mainly do it, a hundred articles every day about Big Brother wants your data, data, data, data.
[00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:16.033]  I didn't read deeper into this article.
[00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:23.380]  I figured it was just another report about Total Information Awareness Network of the thousands we've seen.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.023]  Well, this morning I happened to read deeper into it.
[00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:29.385]  And so we'll cover it today.
[00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.390]  Now, again, we knew this from the federal announcements in 2000.
[00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.231]  The general public couldn't believe it.
[00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:37.251]  Now it's public.
[00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.151]  And I was wrong.
[00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.452]  You will not be given a census once a year.
[00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:46.333]  That's what the preliminary documents said.
[00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:49.534]  Four years ago.
[00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:53.896]  They have now decided to do it every day.
[00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:55.776]  Yes.
[00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:58.437]  Every day.
[00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:03.544]  And you will have to answer every question they give you.
[00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.765]  Everything you do will be tracked and traced.
[00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:11.447]  And this is part of the whole national ID card system.
[00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:13.709]  Now, you're not going to be getting a census every day in the mail.
[00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.210]  You'll get one of those every year in the last few hundreds of questions.
[00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.353]  No, it's just going to be everything you do will be tracked and traced by your loving government.
[00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:25.895]  That's nothing to do with terrorism, of course.
[00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:26.615]  Everything to do with
[00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:32.116]  Managing their control grid and seeing how much they can get out of us on the treadmill.
[00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:38.460]  So, details of this and just so much more coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:45.345]  We have posted the Dean Haglin interview about 9-11 at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:49.969]  In fact, we have a teaser there for non-members, so go check it out.
[00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.810]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.411]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.515 --> 00:05:09.318]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:14.319]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.181]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.963]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.183 --> 00:05:32.327]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:36.849]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:39.570]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.554]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:48.955]  Order online now at InfoWars.com
[00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:49.475]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:04.080]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.323]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:11.366]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:13.948]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:22.795]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.975 --> 00:06:24.336]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:28.660]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.461]  Not yet available?
[00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:02.801]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:10.344]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:15.086]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:25.169]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:29.593]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:32.415]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:38.661]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:07:38.902 --> 00:07:40.463]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:41.363]  Big Brother.
[00:07:41.403 --> 00:07:41.784]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.844 --> 00:08:07.905]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:09.726]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:11.267]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.947 --> 00:08:13.468]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:17.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.852]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:33.619]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, it's Thursday.
[00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.731]  We're good to go.
[00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:08.083]  The attacks.
[00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:12.866]  Motion filed for Philadelphia protesters.
[00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:18.870]  Christians evangelizing at homosexual events seek federal relief.
[00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:30.417]  Now again, I've read the Associated Press and the Philadelphia Daily News and all the mainstream media admits they went there to a designated protest area.
[00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:34.880]  Now it's designated, see here, in the land of the free and home of the slaves.
[00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:53.679]  And they were praying, and the police, there were federal prosecutors there that advised them, Bush appointees there who advised them, that advised local police that what they were saying was hateful and could incite violence.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:04.926]  And so they're facing 47 years in prison apiece, including a young 17-year-old lady who was there praying.
[00:10:06.184 --> 00:10:19.714]  And again, Republican Governor Mark Schweiker, a few years ago, passed a law where if you read from the Old Testament passages critical of homosexuality, you can be arrested or fined.
[00:10:19.734 --> 00:10:25.078]  They've passed similar laws in Europe, Canada, and of course in England.
[00:10:25.238 --> 00:10:27.820]  But now it's happening here in America.
[00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:35.346]  And Pat Robertson and the rest of them aren't going to talk about it because it's the land of milk and honey now with Lord Bush in there.
[00:10:37.405 --> 00:10:46.550]  Our good friend who attends the Bohemian Grove, where the New York Post reports they bust in top gay porn stars who, quote, serve as world leaders.
[00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:53.413]  Wonder why Rush Limbaugh didn't pick up on that.
[00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:56.795]  They're a bunch of hypocrites is what they are, folks.
[00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:01.497]  Very, very serious.
[00:11:03.343 --> 00:11:16.015]  So, regardless of which side of the fence you are on in this issue, don't you believe in people's free speech, in their right to go out on the street corner and say whatever they want?
[00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.939]  Or should they get 47 years?
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:27.505]  That's 47 years in prison for criticizing someone.
[00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:36.710]  Now understand, people are getting two years in prison for having anti-Bush signs on street corners.
[00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:39.331]  Signs that say no blood for oil.
[00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:43.832]  Understand that everybody's losing their freedoms in this country.
[00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:55.454]  But the left, that is the establishment left lackeys, love it when conservatives lose their rights, and the neocon followers love it when liberals lose their rights to speak.
[00:11:57.623 --> 00:12:03.608]  Well, I don't like it when anybody loses their rights, but Christians are being singled out like no one else.
[00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:11.896]  And the Christian church is totally silent on it because they've been cowed through their 501c3.
[00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:16.720]  One of the attorneys for the Christian protesters who are criminally...
[00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:19.063]  You know, it's funny.
[00:12:19.143 --> 00:12:21.405]  Last night on my TV show, I guess great minds think alike.
[00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:24.508]  But I've been doing my TV show for almost 10 years.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.100]  I'm being sarcastic when I say great minds.
[00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:51.281]  Just teasing a little bit about myself.
[00:12:52.102 --> 00:13:02.104]  But I've been thinking about all the hundreds and hundreds of TV shows I've done where I went out and confronted the Million Mom March, known as the 100 Bureaucrat March.
[00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:04.685]  Well, that was in reverse.
[00:13:05.859 --> 00:13:27.424]  The 100 bureaucrat march known as the Million Mom March, or where Delta Force arrested us, or detained us, or all this stuff that I never put in films, that's frankly in many cases even more riveting than what's in my videos, that is going to be lost to the world if we don't show it.
[00:13:28.524 --> 00:13:34.806]  So last night, Mike pulled out an old tape, an old hour-long tape of a demonstration we had against the Million...
[00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:36.338]  Gun grabbers.
[00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:37.879]  And we played it.
[00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:40.500]  And I hadn't seen this in like four years.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]  No, five years.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.881]  It was five years old.
[00:13:45.902 --> 00:13:55.645]  And on this video, it shows us peaceably standing there with a million moms hitting us with signs and yelling at us and throwing water on our cameras.
[00:13:56.505 --> 00:14:04.948]  And then the state police at the Capitol, they go then tattle on us and the state police come over and tell us, well...
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:12.844]  Yes, they're the ones hitting you, and yes, we saw some of that, but I don't care if you have it on videotape.
[00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:16.105]  You're causing them to do that by standing there with a camera.
[00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:27.511]  And, of course, then about a year later, the state lost three different $100,000 lawsuits.
[00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:39.433]  For arresting, well, one group was disabled citizens out protesting Governor Bush on the sidewalk, and they arrested them.
[00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:41.355]  There were two other cases of this.
[00:14:41.916 --> 00:14:43.597]  And so now the state police don't do that.
[00:14:43.838 --> 00:14:45.419]  The APD doesn't do that.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:51.967]  In Austin, Texas, they know that there's a First Amendment because they lost lawsuits.
[00:14:53.570 --> 00:15:01.535]  But you can see this type of stuff in action, and it's going to be on the website in a couple days for the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:15:01.555 --> 00:15:04.036]  I'm going to go ahead and post that whole thing up there.
[00:15:06.558 --> 00:15:12.101]  And from time to time, I'm going to start bringing back old TV shows and playing clips of them on the live broadcast.
[00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:17.364]  But my point is that this is happening to everybody.
[00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:20.086]  And this idea...
[00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:24.124]  That, well, you didn't do anything.
[00:15:25.085 --> 00:15:26.447]  You didn't even say a cuss word.
[00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:28.269]  You didn't say fire in a theater.
[00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:29.510]  You didn't say anything.
[00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:31.933]  But because you were praying...
[00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:55.435]  Or because you were videotaping the 100 Bureaucrat March, or because you were holding up a sign that said, No Blood for Oil, and 500 Bush supporters didn't like it on the sidewalk in their unpermitted demonstration, and you were there with your one sign saying, I don't like Bush, and so the police come arrest you and charge you with felonies under Secret Service orders and say, well, you could have incited something.
[00:15:57.682 --> 00:16:03.687]  So again, speech cannot be punished or banned simply because it might offend a hostile mob.
[00:16:03.987 --> 00:16:05.929]  Well, that's an old Supreme Court ruling.
[00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:20.460]  You see, the new atmosphere is no anti-Bush signs allowed on the parade route coming up next week on the 20th for the inauguration, the coronation of our skull and bones leader.
[00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:22.702]  No crosses allowed.
[00:16:23.043 --> 00:16:24.684]  Those might incite someone.
[00:16:26.175 --> 00:16:29.136]  Understand, these coronations have always been public.
[00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:36.400]  The people can come out and stand on the sides of the streets and do whatever they want as long as they don't jump in the street or, you know, yell fire in the theater.
[00:16:38.141 --> 00:16:39.741]  Not anymore, boys and girls.
[00:16:40.642 --> 00:16:41.382]  Not anymore.
[00:16:44.384 --> 00:16:49.046]  And I have seen reports of people that go to city council meetings and calmly speak.
[00:16:49.938 --> 00:16:52.821]  And the council member doesn't like it and says, hate speech!
[00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:55.142]  Seize that man!
[00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:57.905]  Actually saying, seize that man!
[00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:01.067]  I mean, we're talking about going back to the Middle Ages here.
[00:17:01.908 --> 00:17:02.929]  Or Cuba today.
[00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.811]  Seize that woman!
[00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:06.992]  How dare you!
[00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:10.776]  How dare you!
[00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.618]  So see, none of this has anything to do with terrorism.
[00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:18.182]  But notice, with all the heightened security and the rest of it, this is all a pretext for it.
[00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:28.890]  The filing by the American Family Association Center for Law and Policy seeks emergency relief in federal district court based on evidence from a December preliminary hearing.
[00:17:30.371 --> 00:17:39.217]  A group of 11 Christians was preaching God's word to a crowd of people attending the outfest event and displaying banners with biblical messages.
[00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:52.203]  After a confrontation with a group called the Pink Angels, again, it's all on video, they run up and scream and yell and start stuff, described by protesters as a militant mob, the Christians were arrested and spent a night in jail.
[00:17:53.404 --> 00:17:57.747]  Eight charges were filed, criminal conspiracy, possession of instruments of crime.
[00:17:58.775 --> 00:18:05.997]  Reckless endangerment of another person, ethnic intimidation, riot, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct, obstructing highways.
[00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:06.998]  And it's all admitted.
[00:18:07.038 --> 00:18:08.318]  They were in the designated area.
[00:18:08.758 --> 00:18:09.979]  The police said, you can be here.
[00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:11.059]  They have video.
[00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:11.899]  No weapons.
[00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:12.499]  Nothing happened.
[00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:13.200]  That's all admitted.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.361]  None of the Pink Angels was cited for arrest.
[00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:20.262]  And it goes on and on, folks.
[00:18:21.122 --> 00:18:23.643]  So this is the new America.
[00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.144]  We'll come back, go to Jason, David, Alex.
[00:18:27.952 --> 00:18:30.915]  Michael, Eric, and many, many others that are holding.
[00:18:31.795 --> 00:18:36.239]  Then, Prince Harry says sorry for his Nazi uniform.
[00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:39.742]  Just wearing the Africa Corps.
[00:18:40.863 --> 00:18:48.469]  After all, his grandmother's uncle was a top Nazi.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.501]  They're all German.
[00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:54.365]  The poor British have their grueling German family over them.
[00:18:54.465 --> 00:18:55.466]  Most of them don't even know it.
[00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.389]  They get angry if you tell them a lot of them.
[00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.131]  Well, it's okay.
[00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:03.716]  We've got a German death cult member of the same family as our president.
[00:19:04.437 --> 00:19:05.278]  So it's all right.
[00:19:05.298 --> 00:19:07.240]  I mean, we've got our ruler, too.
[00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:08.862]  It's all right.
[00:19:10.203 --> 00:19:11.484]  We'll all be getting one soon enough.
[00:19:11.724 --> 00:19:19.268]  In fact, America's going to have a real live one who openly says he admires Hitler soon, who actually wasn't even born here.
[00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:22.069]  So don't feel bad.
[00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:29.092]  We've got ours too, but they're getting even purer ones here for us in the near future.
[00:19:30.953 --> 00:19:32.214]  So again, don't feel bad.
[00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:33.755]  Also...
[00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:37.015]  There's just so much here, folks.
[00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.116]  It's just amazing.
[00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:40.976]  Thatcher guilty plea over coup attempt.
[00:19:41.536 --> 00:19:42.476]  Very friendly fella.
[00:19:43.457 --> 00:19:46.737]  And another article here, snooping by satellite, all part of the new freedom.
[00:19:48.418 --> 00:19:52.279]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, after this quick break.
[00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:56.319]  But do not criticize Nazis or you will be labeled anti-Semitic.
[00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:57.040]  And I'm serious.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.640]  When I say that, we'll be right back.
[00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:03.958]  Hey, gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.

[00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.130]  1-800-622
[00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:05.097]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.317 --> 00:21:17.585]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.025 --> 00:21:18.425]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:24.048]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.650]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:28.991]  We're good to go.
[00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:54.282]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:54.442 --> 00:21:56.042]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.442 --> 00:21:57.242]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:04.444]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[00:22:13.925 --> 00:22:18.566]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[00:22:50.152 --> 00:22:51.213]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.141 --> 00:23:01.701]  We're good to go.
[00:23:21.094 --> 00:23:24.976]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:29.618]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.

[00:24:12.394 --> 00:24:13.515]  Always good to hear from you.
[00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:15.657]  Jason in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:24:15.738 --> 00:24:16.579]  Go ahead, Jason.
[00:24:16.999 --> 00:24:17.359]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:17.379 --> 00:24:23.266]  You know, this freedom of speech not only protects the speech you like, it especially protects the speech you hate.
[00:24:24.267 --> 00:24:26.470]  That's all part about, you know,
[00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:29.741]  Accepting the whole freedom of speech issue.
[00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:31.482]  Well, that's why it came first.
[00:24:31.802 --> 00:24:34.084]  It's not the First Amendment for nothing.
[00:24:34.124 --> 00:24:39.428]  But if you look at the First Amendment, number one, the average American doesn't know what the First Amendment is.
[00:24:39.468 --> 00:24:40.849]  They go, oh, freedom of the press.
[00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.290]  No, it's of speech.
[00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:43.311]  It's of religion.
[00:24:43.591 --> 00:24:44.552]  It's of assembly.
[00:24:45.272 --> 00:24:46.333]  It's of petitions.
[00:24:46.774 --> 00:24:48.115]  It's to take action.
[00:24:48.815 --> 00:24:51.037]  Because the pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:54.680]  And our government, when it was a good government, knew that.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.401]  And now you look at the churches.
[00:24:57.313 --> 00:25:07.576]  I mean, I've got memos from Baptist churches where they're told, tell your members don't talk about politics in the pews because we could lose our 501c3.
[00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:09.157]  That's not true.
[00:25:09.577 --> 00:25:12.278]  But I mean, the government just tells the churches this.
[00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:18.840]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.081]  The government isn't supposed to be involved in religion.
[00:25:22.421 --> 00:25:24.822]  You know, my mother had...
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:31.902]  One of those evangelist tapes from, I think it was 75, and he was predicting all this back even then.
[00:25:31.962 --> 00:25:34.362]  The scanners, the microchips.
[00:25:35.002 --> 00:25:44.945]  Exactly, but now those have all been bought up, and you tune into those shows, and it's George Bush's of the Lord, and these scanners aren't bad, and the chips aren't bad.
[00:25:44.965 --> 00:25:50.646]  You know, people tend to forget those kind of sermons when it was okay to talk about those sort of things.
[00:25:51.667 --> 00:25:52.887]  I wanted to ask you, I had...
[00:25:54.655 --> 00:26:01.460]  You had mentioned you had some footage that you haven't released on your videos and whatnot.
[00:26:02.281 --> 00:26:04.822]  I don't have some footage.
[00:26:05.062 --> 00:26:06.584]  I have probably $500.
[00:26:06.664 --> 00:26:10.546]  What I'm doing is I sent you an email.
[00:26:10.566 --> 00:26:15.390]  I don't know if you got it, but I'm writing a short film about the Patriot Act and the Constitution.
[00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.013]  I'm contrasting the two of how it's superseding our liberties.
[00:26:20.865 --> 00:26:39.845]  And I'm doing it in interrogation, kind of, the guy gets pulled over for, you know, receiving traffic stops, and he's taken away by the men in black, so to speak, and I was wondering if... I want to enter it in Sundance, and would it be okay if I use clips of your documentaries...
[00:26:42.438 --> 00:26:42.999]  For references.
[00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:45.621]  Well, are you talking about Sundance this year or next year?
[00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:50.025]  Well, I'd like to get it in by the deadline, but if I can't, then I'll do it for two weeks.
[00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:51.486]  Well, Sundance is next week.
[00:26:51.927 --> 00:26:52.227]  Okay.
[00:26:52.407 --> 00:26:57.772]  See, I'm so out of the loop, so I'd have to do... As soon as the next one, I can enter it in as well.
[00:26:57.792 --> 00:26:59.674]  Yeah, and it's not easy to get into Sundance.
[00:26:59.954 --> 00:27:02.156]  I can imagine, but I feel I have a good script and...
[00:27:04.197 --> 00:27:06.803]  I was wondering if you would want to be a part of it.
[00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:08.828]  Well, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:27:08.868 --> 00:27:10.692]  I was invited to Sundance, but I'm not going.
[00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:12.196]  I've got stuff to do around here.
[00:27:13.889 --> 00:27:18.051]  If anybody does a piece of work and then sends it to me, I mean, I don't want to see it.
[00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:19.192]  I mean, that's what you do.
[00:27:19.272 --> 00:27:22.093]  You make a piece of work, then you try to, you know, get permission from people.
[00:27:22.473 --> 00:27:27.336]  But, I mean, do the work, and then let me see it, and I mean, I probably wouldn't have a problem letting you use some clips.
[00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:29.497]  Frankly, I mean, it's public domain, too.
[00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:32.018]  A lot of it's fair use, so I don't think you really need my permission.
[00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:37.581]  Right, well, just, well, you know, just if I use something with your image or likeness on it.
[00:27:37.641 --> 00:27:38.541]  Well, I'd like to see it.
[00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:39.422]  I'd like to see it.
[00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:40.002]  Okay.
[00:27:40.655 --> 00:27:41.636]  All right, well, thank you for your time.
[00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:42.497]  Yes, sir, do it.
[00:27:42.657 --> 00:27:43.298]  I commend you.
[00:27:43.338 --> 00:27:43.998]  Great job.
[00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:46.080]  David and Mass, you're on the air.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.601]  Go ahead.
[00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:48.202]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:27:48.422 --> 00:27:48.703]  Good.
[00:27:49.684 --> 00:27:50.905]  Listen, I got a story for you.
[00:27:51.465 --> 00:27:52.746]  Maybe you heard it or not.
[00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:54.648]  I don't know, but I saw it this morning.
[00:27:54.668 --> 00:27:57.491]  This is an Associated Press story.
[00:27:57.671 --> 00:28:00.394]  Pair arrested for telling lawyer jokes.
[00:28:01.904 --> 00:28:02.685]  You want me to read this?
[00:28:02.746 --> 00:28:03.827]  There's too many of these.
[00:28:04.508 --> 00:28:05.570]  I missed most of them.
[00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:06.651]  I didn't hear about it.
[00:28:06.972 --> 00:28:08.534]  Yeah, this is the latest one.
[00:28:08.554 --> 00:28:10.096]  I mean, I think it happened on...
[00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:12.566]  You know, a couple days ago.
[00:28:12.586 --> 00:28:18.769]  Well, what about the one where a man arrested for giving 10%, not 20% on tip in New York?
[00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.630]  Yeah, I heard that one.
[00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:26.914]  Or another one, a woman arrested for eating last piece of candy bar as she walked down into the subway system.
[00:28:27.395 --> 00:28:30.396]  Or man arrested for putting feet on park bench.
[00:28:30.637 --> 00:28:34.739]  Or child arrested for saying the word poop.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:35.980]  But go ahead.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.542]  Yeah, this is out of Hampstead, New York.
[00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:43.165]  This says, did you hear the one about the two guys arrested for telling lawyers jokes?
[00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:52.031]  It happened this week to the founders of a group called Americans for Legal Reform who were waiting in line to get into a Long Island courthouse.
[00:28:52.271 --> 00:28:56.054]  Quote, how do you tell when a lawyer is lying?
[00:28:56.114 --> 00:28:56.534]  Unquote.
[00:28:56.574 --> 00:29:00.437]  Harvey Cash reported asked Carl Lazera.
[00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:04.305]  Quote, his lips are moving, unquote, they said in unison.
[00:29:04.825 --> 00:29:12.209]  While some waiting to get into the courthouse giggled, a lawyer farther up the line Monday was not laughing.
[00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:22.395]  He told them to pipe down, and when they did not, the lawyer reported the pair to court personnel who charged them with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor.
[00:29:22.715 --> 00:29:24.116]  I think they should be sent to a camp.
[00:29:24.136 --> 00:29:25.417]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:29:25.437 --> 00:29:26.318]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:29:26.438 --> 00:29:28.099]  Email it to me, okay?
[00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:30.681]  But stay there.
[00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:31.742]  I want to hear more about the article.
[00:29:31.782 --> 00:29:32.242]  Okay, David?
[00:29:33.783 --> 00:29:34.283]  You still there?
[00:29:34.323 --> 00:29:34.523]  Good.
[00:29:34.543 --> 00:29:34.843]  Stay there.
[00:29:34.863 --> 00:29:35.263]  Don't hang up.
[00:29:35.743 --> 00:29:36.003]  Okay.
[00:29:36.203 --> 00:29:36.904]  I always say don't hang up.
[00:29:36.924 --> 00:29:37.304]  People do.
[00:29:37.824 --> 00:29:38.544]  I want to hear about this.
[00:29:38.584 --> 00:29:39.925]  Look, this is good, folks.
[00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:43.046]  And David may be supporting Al-Qaeda right now.
[00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:44.887]  We might want to arrest him.
[00:29:45.467 --> 00:29:46.247]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:46.707]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:52.590]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.671]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:58.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.306 --> 00:30:04.989]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:09.572]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:30:09.812 --> 00:30:16.737]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:30:17.117 --> 00:30:23.761]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:30:24.081 --> 00:30:27.563]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:27.703 --> 00:30:28.504]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:39.809]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:46.592]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:30:46.792 --> 00:30:51.455]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:54.196]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:58.998]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:31:00.945 --> 00:31:08.447]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.727 --> 00:31:19.630]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:20.210]  I think so.
[00:31:44.483 --> 00:31:53.234]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.254 --> 00:31:53.955]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.461 --> 00:32:09.764]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:14.807]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:32:15.027 --> 00:32:18.889]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:32:19.129 --> 00:32:22.070]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:38.054]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:44.715]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:32:45.095 --> 00:32:48.816]  Call International Health for your free audio information package at 1-800-974-1879.
[00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:49.896]  We're so sure it works, we guarantee it.
[00:32:49.956 --> 00:32:51.056]  That's 1-800-974-1879 or visit supersilver.net.
[00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:51.676]  The broadcast has...
[00:33:15.581 --> 00:33:19.525]  I guess gotten off into the First Amendment, which is always a great subject to talk about.
[00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:23.248]  All of our basic rights are under attack right now.
[00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:25.531]  The Bill of Rights doesn't give you your rights.
[00:33:25.571 --> 00:33:29.474]  It simply enumerates them, points out God-given existing rights.
[00:33:29.514 --> 00:33:36.061]  And even if you don't believe in God, which I think is foolish, you should understand that it's real simple.
[00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:37.882]  And I use this analogy.
[00:33:38.062 --> 00:33:39.364]  A slave in Rome...
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:58.106]  Who say had been grabbed out of Gaul, whose family had been killed, and hauled back to Rome, who was then working out on, say, a vineyard as a slave, has a right to stand up against the slave master, even if the slave master says, it's the law that you're my slave.
[00:33:59.907 --> 00:34:09.590]  Or the overused example I like to use is the black slave 200 years ago in America.
[00:34:10.856 --> 00:34:21.420]  Does the black slave, who's not really a slave, is a human being, have a right, as they're being whipped, to grab the whip away and beat their would-be master over the head with it?
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.301]  Well, according to this government, no.
[00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:32.123]  Alberto Gonzalez has said that Bush is above the law, he is the law, and that they can torture people unto death.
[00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:39.906]  The tales of the memos are now public, that they can torture someone to the point of death, and if they have organ failure and die, it's not their fault.
[00:34:41.664 --> 00:34:43.704]  Now, folks, there's no other way to boil that down.
[00:34:44.445 --> 00:34:46.645]  That is saying we are God.
[00:34:47.265 --> 00:34:48.546]  The government is God.
[00:34:49.206 --> 00:34:59.388]  David, we're about to go back to you because you're reading an article out of New York that I was unaware of where people made a lawyer joke about how do you know when a lawyer's lying, his lips move, and they got arrested.
[00:34:59.408 --> 00:35:04.629]  We'll go to you in about three minutes, and then to Alex and Richard and Eric and Joe and others.
[00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:08.230]  But right now, Debbie from New Millennium Concepts
[00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:14.584]  The American-made premium water purification systems.
[00:35:15.544 --> 00:35:18.287]  And Debbie, honored to have you on with us, my dear.
[00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:19.207]  Hi, Alex.
[00:35:19.248 --> 00:35:21.089]  I am so honored to be here.
[00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:22.690]  Thanks for having me.
[00:35:22.951 --> 00:35:25.673]  Well, first we have to apologize that these are made in America.
[00:35:26.579 --> 00:35:29.381]  We also offer the British-made ones, which is even worse.
[00:35:29.921 --> 00:35:31.982]  Again, supporting a Western country is bad.
[00:35:32.903 --> 00:35:35.725]  But your premium system is made right here in America.
[00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:43.650]  And you've got some great specials, and there's articles every day about all the trash in the water, why people keep drinking it.
[00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:49.393]  I have no idea, but it's time to break that bad habit and to follow that New Year's resolution to get healthy.
[00:35:49.693 --> 00:35:53.656]  And the best way to do it is to call you right now and order one of these babies.
[00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:55.172]  That's correct.
[00:35:55.552 --> 00:36:11.405]  And they can reach me at my toll-free number, which is 1-888-803-4438, and just mention that they heard it on Alex Jones, and it helps support your broadcasting time over the short wave.
[00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:17.189]  So, you know, we really would like to have people call in and tell us that they heard it on your show.
[00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.332]  And I would love to emphasize that
[00:36:20.965 --> 00:36:31.028]  It's never too soon to get a Berkey water filter, especially with the environmental concerns that we're having right now and the different weather changes.
[00:36:31.288 --> 00:36:40.810]  It's always a good idea to filter your water before drinking it, whether you're getting it from the tap, rainwater, a well, a pond or a lake.
[00:36:41.331 --> 00:36:46.153]  Berkey water filters really do make a difference, and I cannot emphasize it more.
[00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:47.653]  Let's be clear.
[00:36:48.074 --> 00:36:48.654]  Let's be clear.
[00:36:48.694 --> 00:36:50.094]  You have the university studies.
[00:36:50.134 --> 00:36:51.175]  We've covered them on air.
[00:36:52.615 --> 00:36:54.256]  Just incredible information.
[00:36:54.276 --> 00:36:57.617]  A new standard of water purification.
[00:36:57.677 --> 00:37:01.819]  They take the water out of a big Berkey after it's been purified and cleansed,
[00:37:02.549 --> 00:37:05.672]  They put it under an electron microscope a week later.
[00:37:06.312 --> 00:37:10.536]  After they've given any bacteria a chance to grow, there's nothing in it.
[00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:12.537]  There are no bacteria.
[00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:14.539]  There is nothing there.
[00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:15.660]  Okay, folks?
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.564]  Only reverse osmosis can do this, but then it cuts out the good minerals.
[00:37:21.044 --> 00:37:25.388]  The Berkeys don't do that, which is so important.
[00:37:26.248 --> 00:37:30.292]  And, folks, it's now time to take action.
[00:37:30.968 --> 00:37:40.032]  You can, for like 200 bucks, you can buy a knockoff made in China or India that costs the same amount as the Berkey Light with the black Berkey elements.
[00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.054]  And these are made in India, total pieces of junk.
[00:37:44.135 --> 00:37:45.797]  There's been news reports on this.
[00:37:46.457 --> 00:37:52.121]  You need to get the made-in-America, high-quality, and the difference is you pick up a black element, it's heavy.
[00:37:52.522 --> 00:38:03.870]  You pick up one of these white elements, these Indian elements, and it sounds like there's some sand in them, and it weighs like a feather.
[00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.492]  It's very simple, folks.
[00:38:07.339 --> 00:38:15.626]  And whereas one of those junk models might cut out amoebas or something, it's not cutting out pathogenic bacteria or toxins or heavy metals.
[00:38:15.967 --> 00:38:17.868]  The black Berkey elements do this.
[00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:21.051]  So do your British Berkey elements, but this is a new standard.
[00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:22.972]  Folks need to give you a call.
[00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:24.234]  A bunch of different specials.
[00:38:24.854 --> 00:38:26.415]  How do they call you, Debbie?
[00:38:26.435 --> 00:38:27.937]  They can reach me toll free at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:32.871 --> 00:38:44.718]  Or they can go to our website, which is www.berkeywater.com, and it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:49.361]  And in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special and what free gift you want.
[00:38:49.581 --> 00:38:50.782]  Tell folks about the free gifts.
[00:38:51.483 --> 00:39:00.368]  You get the choice of either Berkey sport bottles, the generic labeled ones, or potassium iodate, or the movie Sheltering in Place.
[00:39:00.828 --> 00:39:00.948]  And...
[00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:07.495]  If they get the Berkey light without the lights it's $1.99 and they get one free gift.
[00:39:08.115 --> 00:39:11.398]  If they get the Berkey light with the lights it's two free gifts.
[00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:14.421]  So it kind of pays for itself to get it with the lights.
[00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:18.683]  All right, folks, here is the toll-free number, 1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:19.383 --> 00:39:27.146]  If you call and the phone's busy, call right back or leave your name and number, and Debbie will call you right back.
[00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:28.146]  She's a real sweetheart.
[00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:33.508]  Give her a call, or you could go out and buy something made in China, which will cost the same price.
[00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:38.650]  I mean, I'd just go ahead and do that, because it would be kind of evil to buy something made in America.
[00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.351]  It's kind of like a treasure hunt to find something made in America, Debbie.
[00:39:43.138 --> 00:39:43.578]  I know.
[00:39:43.598 --> 00:39:44.798]  I know.
[00:39:44.838 --> 00:39:51.180]  You know, I used to shop at a major discount store that everybody knows about.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.040]  Slide Mark.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.401]  Yeah, well, you know, and they used to be Made in America.
[00:39:55.501 --> 00:39:57.782]  Remember when they first came out with that store?
[00:39:58.222 --> 00:40:01.923]  Everything said Made in America and they had American flags on everything.
[00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:03.163]  I mean, it was so cool.
[00:40:03.643 --> 00:40:06.224]  And now, nothing there is Made in America.
[00:40:06.764 --> 00:40:15.990]  And, you know, shoe sizes are different and clothes sizes are different because they think that we're foreign, you know, and that we're smaller than we are as Americans.
[00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.732]  You know, it seems like things are smaller.
[00:40:18.752 --> 00:40:20.013]  I mean, I'm just amazed.
[00:40:21.207 --> 00:40:24.431]  You know, what happened to that Made in America thing that they used to have?
[00:40:24.652 --> 00:40:32.923]  Well, they got caught with their pants down on them because they have the signs up everywhere, but the boxes were Made in America, but not the items.
[00:40:33.504 --> 00:40:33.624]  Ah.
[00:40:33.644 --> 00:40:34.886]  Yeah, big scandal.
[00:40:34.906 --> 00:40:36.629]  They even passed a law because of that.
[00:40:37.425 --> 00:40:38.467]  Debbie, good hearing from you.
[00:40:38.487 --> 00:40:38.987]  God bless.
[00:40:39.328 --> 00:40:40.209]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:40:40.409 --> 00:40:40.970]  Take care.
[00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:41.431]  You bet.
[00:40:41.451 --> 00:40:42.152]  Take care, folks.
[00:40:42.832 --> 00:40:44.294]  Give her a call, 888-803-4438.
[00:40:44.374 --> 00:40:48.560]  All right, David and Mass, thanks for holding.
[00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:51.163]  Recap what you were saying last segment.
[00:40:51.183 --> 00:40:52.245]  You have this news article.
[00:40:52.525 --> 00:40:55.269]  Tell us the newspaper name and read it to us again.
[00:40:56.247 --> 00:41:06.018]  Well, actually, it's from the Associated Press, but actually the link I got off was the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:08.140]  Okay, Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.303]  Give us the headline and folks can type it in the search engine and get it.
[00:41:11.764 --> 00:41:11.984]  Yeah.
[00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:15.688]  The headline is, Pair Arrested for Telling Lawyer Jokes.
[00:41:17.617 --> 00:41:19.638]  Pair arrested for telling lawyer jokes.
[00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:21.059]  Yeah, that's the headline.
[00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.700]  So, yeah, if you type that in, you'll get it.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.121]  And read us the article.
[00:41:24.822 --> 00:41:25.182]  Okay.
[00:41:25.962 --> 00:41:27.363]  Yeah, okay, from the top then.
[00:41:27.763 --> 00:41:28.704]  Hampstead, New York.
[00:41:28.744 --> 00:41:33.127]  Did you hear the one about the two guys arrested for telling lawyer jokes?
[00:41:33.787 --> 00:41:42.350]  It happened this week to the founders of a group called Americans for Legal Reform who were waiting in line to get into a Long Island courthouse.
[00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.391]  Quote, How do you tell when a lawyer is lying?
[00:41:45.472 --> 00:41:45.892]  Unquote.
[00:41:45.932 --> 00:41:48.953]  Harvey Cash reportedly asked Carl Mazzara.
[00:41:50.313 --> 00:41:52.954]  His lips are moving, they said in unison.
[00:41:53.415 --> 00:41:59.797]  While some waiting to get into the courthouse giggled, a lawyer farther up the line Monday was not laughing.
[00:42:00.854 --> 00:42:09.719]  He told them to pipe down, and when they did not, the lawyer reported the pair to court personnel who charged them with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor.
[00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:14.541]  Quote, They just can't take it, unquote, Cash said of lawyers in general.
[00:42:14.862 --> 00:42:17.403]  Quote, This violates our First Amendment rights, unquote.
[00:42:18.083 --> 00:42:29.169]  Dan Bagniola, a spokesman for the Nassau County Courts, said the men were being, quote, were being disrupt-abusive and they were causing a disturbance, unquote.
[00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:30.110]  He said...
[00:42:30.945 --> 00:42:33.106]  He did not have the name of the lawyer who complained.
[00:42:33.126 --> 00:42:34.806]  I mean, that's the gist of it.
[00:42:34.826 --> 00:42:36.067]  There's a couple other paragraphs.
[00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.548]  So now somebody complains.
[00:42:38.868 --> 00:42:43.429]  Yeah, being abusive and they were causing a disturbance for telling lawyers jokes.
[00:42:44.389 --> 00:42:48.371]  That's being abusive and constitutes being arrested for a misdemeanor.
[00:42:50.011 --> 00:42:52.412]  Well, that's what it's all about now in America.
[00:42:52.692 --> 00:42:57.974]  And, I mean, Christians are facing 47 years in prison, admittedly, for preying on a street corner.
[00:42:58.604 --> 00:43:06.328]  Yeah, and I'm guessing that this was a courthouse, so I'm guessing they were waiting on the sidewalk in a public place, in a public area.
[00:43:07.448 --> 00:43:14.432]  So, I mean, this really gets back to... I mean, we're not going to be able to walk down the street and say anything, I guess, pretty soon.
[00:43:14.972 --> 00:43:21.956]  Well, it may hurt somebody's feelings, and then if you hurt someone's feelings, they can become upset, and that breaks down the fabric of society.
[00:43:22.256 --> 00:43:24.757]  When the fabric of society breaks down, it aids Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:26.426]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:43:26.466 --> 00:43:27.526]  This is the new idea.
[00:43:28.007 --> 00:43:34.971]  Speeding, pot dealing, selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes, complaining to the VA.
[00:43:35.011 --> 00:43:39.213]  I mean, they arrested him as a terrorist and said he complained to the VA.
[00:43:39.233 --> 00:43:43.756]  He didn't threaten anybody, but complaining took our time up and is evil.
[00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:46.948]  So Homeland Security had to go arrest the guy.
[00:43:46.988 --> 00:43:48.770]  I mean, this is the new freedom, sir.
[00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:49.792]  Well, that's it.
[00:43:49.812 --> 00:43:56.640]  Really, it gets back to when they eviscerated the unions back in Woodrow Wilson's end of the days, back in the 20s.
[00:43:57.361 --> 00:44:00.384]  Business elites went berserk when they passed the Wagner Act of 1935.
[00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:05.150]  And think of it, unions were the only really countervailing force.
[00:44:06.496 --> 00:44:07.076]  Of any kind.
[00:44:07.116 --> 00:44:10.159]  And so they use the mafia to infiltrate them and take control of them.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.060]  That's right.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.685]  And ever since that, the unions have been eviscerated.
[00:44:15.765 --> 00:44:19.409]  So they've eviscerated really every fabric of social...
[00:44:20.743 --> 00:44:21.303]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:58.294]  Well, there were cases back in the 20s and 30s where they would just pull up with private security men with Tommy guns and start shooting people.
[00:44:58.834 --> 00:45:02.355]  I've seen film of that, them just mowing strikers down.
[00:45:02.716 --> 00:45:10.459]  It was much more violent then, but that's the reason they had to go to these more scientific methods of strike-breaking, which is really massive propaganda.
[00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:13.180]  I mean, they put this in motion very...
[00:45:14.088 --> 00:45:15.889]  ...viscerously after World War II.
[00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.830]  The book is great.
[00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:22.853]  It's by this woman named Elizabeth A. Fones-Wolf, and she doesn't profess any kind of political allegiance.
[00:45:25.675 --> 00:45:29.916]  So it's not really part of this false left-right paradigm or any of... Sounds interesting.
[00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:31.236]  David, thanks for the call.
[00:45:31.756 --> 00:45:32.476]  I'll check it out.
[00:45:32.536 --> 00:45:33.296]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:33.757 --> 00:45:35.857]  And I'll look for that article you just mentioned.
[00:45:35.877 --> 00:45:36.697]  Please email it to me.
[00:45:37.277 --> 00:45:39.658]  Let's talk to Alex in Louisiana.
[00:45:39.718 --> 00:45:40.318]  Welcome, Alex.
[00:45:40.658 --> 00:45:41.058]  Hi, Alex.
[00:45:41.518 --> 00:45:42.758]  I got two quick points to make.
[00:45:42.818 --> 00:45:44.839]  First, great interviews you had yesterday.
[00:45:44.879 --> 00:45:47.419]  I'm glad you had Mr. Daniel Hopstick on.
[00:45:48.099 --> 00:45:50.300]  He has a lot of information and connects the dots.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.320]  So my question to you is, why do you think
[00:45:53.423 --> 00:45:59.426]  The leading hijackers were hanging around with all these drug dealers and foreign operatives and engaging in decadent parties.
[00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:01.267]  Do you think they were trying to create a cover?
[00:46:01.787 --> 00:46:04.808]  Or was it real and somehow these people were involved in 9-11?
[00:46:06.849 --> 00:46:10.791]  Well, I mean, clearly we have hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.691]  military bases.
[00:46:11.711 --> 00:46:12.431]  That's admitted.
[00:46:13.252 --> 00:46:15.292]  Clearly these guys were government operatives.
[00:46:15.393 --> 00:46:18.574]  They thought, from the evidence I have, they were part of a training drill.
[00:46:20.193 --> 00:46:32.420]  Because, you know, James Woods, the actor, had seen Ada and four other guys on a plane doing hijack simulations, and Woods got off the plane and said, they're trying to hijack, and the FBI said, we'll arrest you under national security if you tell anybody.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.581]  So we know that there was a drill going.
[00:46:34.661 --> 00:46:38.143]  These al-Qaeda operatives actually were government operatives.
[00:46:38.483 --> 00:46:39.944]  They thought they were part of a drill.
[00:46:40.504 --> 00:46:43.026]  Some could argue that they then hijacked themselves.
[00:46:43.406 --> 00:46:45.187]  But why did NORAD stand down?
[00:46:45.867 --> 00:46:46.808]  Why did all this happen?
[00:46:47.908 --> 00:46:52.270]  So, all we know is the government knew and paid the hijackers.
[00:46:52.751 --> 00:46:56.272]  Then you can argue about what happened once they were on board the aircraft.
[00:46:59.073 --> 00:47:00.114]  Okay.
[00:47:00.554 --> 00:47:10.859]  And second, I'm angry at the recent immigration booklet that the Mexican government published encouraging illegal immigration because, I mean, that is almost a direct act of war and the U.S.
[00:47:10.899 --> 00:47:12.920]  government is doing absolutely nothing about it.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.221]  Well, could you imagine if...
[00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:27.158]  Say France published a booklet on how to get illegal aliens into Germany and how to take Germany over.
[00:47:28.418 --> 00:47:33.060]  Or if the Flemish put together a booklet about how to infiltrate France.
[00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:36.402]  Yes, it is an act of war.
[00:47:36.522 --> 00:47:40.644]  It is an act of prosecution of war.
[00:47:41.528 --> 00:47:43.469]  But again, Wall Street wants this.
[00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:49.730]  Wall Street wants to get rid of our borders, wants the Pan-American Union, and is actually spurring Mexico to do this.
[00:47:50.691 --> 00:47:51.231]  Absolutely.
[00:47:51.271 --> 00:47:53.291]  Talk about double standards, you know.
[00:47:53.691 --> 00:47:58.933]  The government allows millions of illegals to come in and damage the economy and society at the same time placing...
[00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:03.294]  Police state measures on its citizens to protect us against terrorism.
[00:48:03.634 --> 00:48:04.435]  Well, yeah, that's the thing.
[00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:06.177]  We're going to have a yearly census now.
[00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.057]  They're now admitting it.
[00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:08.959]  Everything we do is going to be tracked and traced.
[00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:09.619]  No freedoms.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.081]  Arrested for any reason.
[00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.722]  Giant prisons are being built everywhere.
[00:48:13.443 --> 00:48:18.867]  Accelerating this police state incarceration institutionalization grid.
[00:48:19.588 --> 00:48:26.694]  And then the actual Homeland Security Bill, Part 2 they just passed, the Intelligence Reform Act, as they called it,
[00:48:27.806 --> 00:48:39.677]  In that baby, in this omnibus monster, they actually have part of the amnesty bill in there to make the states and cities accept fake ID cards from foreigners.
[00:48:43.401 --> 00:48:44.362]  So good point, Alex.
[00:48:44.862 --> 00:48:46.103]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:46.824]  You bet.
[00:48:46.884 --> 00:48:47.384]  Take care.
[00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.266]  Yeah, that's a good illustration he just made.
[00:48:50.027 --> 00:48:51.769]  Let's talk to Richard in Ohio.
[00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:52.529]  Richard, welcome.
[00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:53.250]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:53.755 --> 00:48:54.315]  How are you doing today?
[00:48:54.456 --> 00:48:54.696]  Good.
[00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:58.718]  Hey, isn't your prior caller picked up or left off?
[00:48:58.838 --> 00:49:03.642]  In fact, I fetched you an outline of my book the other day.
[00:49:03.662 --> 00:49:11.867]  The title of the book is Supply-Side Economics, Globalization, the End of Capitalism and Democracy, a Corridor to 9-11.
[00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:19.713]  In the book, I use the evolution of the greatest generation, and I go from the year 45 to
[00:49:21.044 --> 00:49:22.025]  We're good to go.
[00:49:22.045 --> 00:49:22.425]  I think?
[00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:58.131]  Well, what really happened is they took the economic pie so they could socially engineer with that money, and then now, this is the same thing we did in other countries, once they get us dependent, then they take the pie away.
[00:49:58.851 --> 00:50:09.780]  Well, my point was that technology allowed the system, and I call it the system because it allowed the system to exploit another labor force.
[00:50:10.947 --> 00:50:25.013]  When our companies were able to start going into Mexico, you know, technology, real-time information, the intranet, you know, that allowed the supply chain to, you know, come from another source.
[00:50:25.213 --> 00:50:28.755]  Yeah, well, to come from 50 places and then all be assembled somewhere else.
[00:50:28.795 --> 00:50:38.879]  Well, yeah, and so as... And then another thing, too, is when you look at that generation, after World War II, the country was basically united
[00:50:39.557 --> 00:50:54.395]  And all the sacrifices that they had, that they incurred, you know, during World War II, the Depression, that it wasn't the Union, it was the people behind the Union.
[00:50:54.835 --> 00:50:56.197]  There was nobody going to take
[00:50:56.804 --> 00:51:00.288]  Finish up on the other side.
[00:51:00.328 --> 00:51:01.089]  We'll be back, Richard.
[00:51:01.229 --> 00:51:05.574]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.735 --> 00:51:10.160]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.685]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.725 --> 00:51:16.066]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.868 --> 00:51:22.070]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:29.073]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.193 --> 00:51:31.294]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.574 --> 00:51:41.959]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.979 --> 00:51:44.340]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.623]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.083 --> 00:51:50.685]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:51:51.866 --> 00:51:53.147]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.593 --> 00:52:02.574]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:52:02.654 --> 00:52:03.314]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:03.434 --> 00:52:13.356]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.736 --> 00:52:18.277]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.337 --> 00:52:29.660]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:37.105]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.505 --> 00:52:39.647]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:52:40.127 --> 00:52:45.091]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:52:45.391 --> 00:52:51.560]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:33.157 --> 00:53:33.557]  We're good to go.
[00:53:33.617 --> 00:53:33.998]  I think?
[00:54:05.971 --> 00:54:07.892]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.353 --> 00:54:11.214]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.657 --> 00:54:18.159]  All right, Richard, do me a favor.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.702]  Condense the economic theorem.
[00:54:22.782 --> 00:54:24.743]  Okay, okay, I'll go through real quick.
[00:54:25.264 --> 00:54:33.669]  Yesterday's economy, all wealth, stimulation, creation, and circulation was done through the middle class while working in the factories.
[00:54:34.358 --> 00:54:39.960]  Today all wealth stimulation, creation and circulation is done through the stock market and through the wealthy.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:46.482]  In 1980 there were 75 lobbyists in Washington.
[00:54:46.862 --> 00:54:47.763]  Today there are 30,000.
[00:54:47.863 --> 00:54:52.724]  That's an accurate number.
[00:54:52.824 --> 00:54:53.805]  I was going to say that.
[00:54:55.104 --> 00:54:57.465]  And I'll let you go, and I'm going to send you a copy of the book.
[00:54:57.725 --> 00:55:00.427]  By the way, that's 30,000 in Washington alone.
[00:55:00.467 --> 00:55:01.067]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:02.748]  There's over 10,000 in Texas.
[00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:04.349]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:09.731]  And here's my, when I talk about terrorism, here's what I say in the book.
[00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:16.614]  I said, we're 30 years into the global economy, and half the people in the world make less than $2 a day.
[00:55:17.395 --> 00:55:21.657]  So I say that in this global economy, we're having sort of a labor revolt.
[00:55:22.202 --> 00:55:24.223]  Well, what's happening is... Let me finish.
[00:55:25.323 --> 00:55:31.465]  In representing the $2 a day laborers of Osama Bin Laden, we're not being attacked by Muslims.
[00:55:31.545 --> 00:55:34.666]  Poverty creates extreme action.
[00:55:35.766 --> 00:55:38.167]  Richard, I don't know how long you've been listening to this show.
[00:55:38.407 --> 00:55:39.947]  Well, I like to live in Austin.
[00:55:40.668 --> 00:55:42.728]  Let me just comment on something here.
[00:55:42.768 --> 00:55:43.668]  You've been talking.
[00:55:44.949 --> 00:55:48.830]  What's happening is the globalists are carrying out terror attacks...
[00:55:49.571 --> 00:55:53.853]  As a pretext to go after the third world that they call the gap.
[00:55:55.014 --> 00:55:59.156]  And the Pentagon admits, quote, we work for Wall Street.
[00:55:59.496 --> 00:56:00.036]  Of course.
[00:56:00.216 --> 00:56:02.237]  We're taking over the third world.
[00:56:02.318 --> 00:56:12.443]  So this line that we hear from certain quarters that, oh, this is the third world striking back, that's what the globalists would like you to believe.
[00:56:12.463 --> 00:56:12.963]  Mm-hmm.
[00:56:13.593 --> 00:56:21.355]  The globalists want an excuse to go in the third world countries they don't control and labor markets they don't control and physically dominate them.
[00:56:21.455 --> 00:56:22.096]  Oh, of course.
[00:56:22.256 --> 00:56:22.756]  Of course.
[00:56:22.876 --> 00:56:23.236]  Of course.
[00:56:23.316 --> 00:56:27.157]  And what I say in the book is that when Clinton... See, I'm not against trade.
[00:56:27.477 --> 00:56:35.640]  When Clinton signed those trade agreements, if you were to put human worker rights stipulations into those agreements... Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.160]  Listen, I've got to let you go.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.381]  It's a race to the bottom because...
[00:56:40.333 --> 00:56:40.994]  We're good to go.
[00:57:01.761 --> 00:57:11.364]  And the middle class disappears, and you have a giant underclass with a small ruling elite who are not free market ruling over the population.
[00:57:11.884 --> 00:57:12.845]  But good points, Richard.
[00:57:12.865 --> 00:57:13.825]  Call me back some other time.
[00:57:13.845 --> 00:57:16.146]  We'll talk more about it, and I'll try to read that.
[00:57:16.806 --> 00:57:17.686]  I saw your fax.
[00:57:17.726 --> 00:57:18.526]  I'll try to read that.
[00:57:20.047 --> 00:57:26.629]  Before I end this hour and come back with Craig Roberts and, of course, more of your calls, and then later Jack McClam...
[00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:42.568]  Before I do that, I do just want to briefly tell all of the listeners of this broadcast that, well, I've made great films, and they're good videos that you need to have that are riveting and will inform you to a higher level, I believe.
[00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:48.112]  But at the same time, it also makes this broadcast possible and supports what we're doing, and we do need your support.
[00:57:48.652 --> 00:57:49.833]  I've made 11 videos.
[00:57:50.053 --> 00:57:53.916]  I also carry a bunch of other videos and books, like George Humphrey's 9-11 podcast,
[00:57:55.416 --> 00:58:05.620]  The Great Illusion, Eric Huffman's 9-11 Painful Deceptions, my two 9-11 films, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the occult activities of the global elite exposed.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.681]  All of these are great films.
[00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.602]  Big discounts when you get multiple videos.

[00:58:45.322 --> 00:58:49.287]  Alright, second hour, your calls, a ton of news and guests coming up.
[00:58:57.576 --> 00:58:58.237]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.878 --> 00:58:59.879]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.638 --> 00:59:01.739]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.399 --> 00:59:03.260]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:04.881]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:09.463]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.723 --> 00:59:13.886]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.808 --> 00:59:25.932]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now into hour number two on this Thursday, the 13th day of
[00:59:28.243 --> 00:59:29.023]  Of January 05.
[00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:33.325]  Yes, we've made it well into 05 now, my friends.
[00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:49.493]  And there is so much news and information I want to talk about with our esteemed guest, Colonel Craig Roberts, best-selling author of One Shot, One Kill, a Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam, also a colonel, of course, in the Army.
[00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:57.352]  Worked in Army Intelligence, helicopter pilot, SWAT team officer in the police department, did detective work on Oklahoma City.
[00:59:59.053 --> 01:00:04.655]  Quite a renaissance man when it comes to the security services and the military.
[01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:06.316]  And we haven't had him on.
[01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:13.439]  Well, we had him on a few months ago for a little while just to pop in, but I haven't had Craig on in about six months for several hours.
[01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:16.600]  And I know a lot of you are glad to hear him back on the show.
[01:00:17.688 --> 01:00:18.588]  And there's a bunch of news.
[01:00:18.608 --> 01:00:24.209]  I'm going to talk about the war in Iraq, and I know you can't say too much because you could be called up to active duty any time.
[01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:31.871]  You're pretty much a young'un compared to some of the guys who are 75 years old getting called back up into advisory capacities.
[01:00:31.951 --> 01:00:34.532]  But it's good to have you on with us, Craig.
[01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:35.872]  I also want to talk about Oklahoma City.
[01:00:36.452 --> 01:00:37.712]  Always glad to be back, Alex.
[01:00:38.812 --> 01:00:40.193]  A lot has happened.
[01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:46.791]  First off, they've announced that they may not just make the National Guard stay in Iraq for two years.
[01:00:47.251 --> 01:00:51.720]  Now they're talking about four years, but all the military science says that
[01:00:52.293 --> 01:00:56.795]  The average person can't handle more than a tour of combat, 11 months.
[01:00:57.276 --> 01:00:59.877]  How do you make people stay in combat for four years, Colonel?
[01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:02.278]  Well, they won't do that.
[01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:06.940]  I mean, there will be people who will do, like we did in Vietnam.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.141]  A few people did two tours.
[01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:13.944]  A very small number did three, but they were mostly requesting to go back or volunteered when they were asked.
[01:01:15.185 --> 01:01:16.625]  Two tours is not unusual.
[01:01:16.645 --> 01:01:17.906]  It depends on how long the tour is.
[01:01:17.946 --> 01:01:20.927]  Now, if you're talking about a six-month tour, two of those is only a year.
[01:01:20.967 --> 01:01:21.828]  I did a year in Vietnam.
[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:27.455]  If you're talking about year-long tours, two tours is about as much as anybody can stand.
[01:01:27.535 --> 01:01:31.700]  It's a much more far-reaching problem besides the psychological effect.
[01:01:33.586 --> 01:01:35.327]  Let's talk about the psychological effect for a minute.
[01:01:35.887 --> 01:01:37.107]  You have different types of people.
[01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:44.929]  You've got people who can take it and look forward to it and it's the adrenaline rush and the adventure and this is something I'm doing with my life.
[01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:53.812]  Then you have people who want to be home and they want to deal with their family, raise the kids and work in a cubicle or sell shoes to women at the mall and that's their objective in life.
[01:01:53.872 --> 01:01:57.453]  You put those types of people in the same combat scenario you put the first group in
[01:01:58.013 --> 01:01:58.454]  We're good to go.
[01:02:19.722 --> 01:02:22.163]  And there's some other things that are happening too, Alex.
[01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:26.564]  They're also not treating the Garden Reserves the same they do the active forces.
[01:02:26.684 --> 01:02:29.785]  I have witnessed this myself on numerous occasions when I've been on active duty.
[01:02:30.286 --> 01:02:35.968]  The Garden Reserves are treated like amateurs or stepchildren or wannabes or weekend warriors.
[01:02:35.988 --> 01:02:42.250]  Well, they're certainly not wannabes now, telling them clear 20 houses a day.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:43.270]  Well, no, they're not.
[01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:44.390]  But the thing about it is, guess what?
[01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:45.551]  They're not getting the same benefits.
[01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:47.491]  They're not getting the same retirement package.
[01:02:47.752 --> 01:02:48.972]  They're not getting the same promises.
[01:02:49.312 --> 01:02:49.792]  We're good to go.
[01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:11.847]  Stay there.
[01:03:11.907 --> 01:03:13.668]  I want to talk about this when we get back for a few minutes.
[01:03:13.688 --> 01:03:16.830]  Then I want to get into Oklahoma City and a bunch of other issues.
[01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:18.031]  But this is important, folks.
[01:03:18.051 --> 01:03:19.932]  Because the new Rumsfeld memo is saying, yes, we're losing.
[01:03:19.952 --> 01:03:20.212]  We're losing.
[01:03:20.232 --> 01:03:20.712]  We're losing.
[01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:44.412]  And so their answer is a greater iron fist.
[01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:49.820]  So we'll talk about a bunch of different issues concerning the war, and then we'll get into some other news.
[01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:50.562]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.174 --> 01:03:54.715]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:57.956]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.096 --> 01:04:01.978]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:06.279]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.401]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.521 --> 01:04:12.342]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:15.584 --> 01:04:20.588]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.748 --> 01:04:23.810]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:26.832]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.332 --> 01:04:33.437]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.977 --> 01:04:34.698]  We're good to go.
[01:04:34.718 --> 01:04:35.178]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.705 --> 01:04:55.586]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:04:55.946 --> 01:04:58.806]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:04:59.046 --> 01:05:05.248]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:05:05.608 --> 01:05:12.929]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:17.130]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:05:52.054 --> 01:05:55.436]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:05:55.676 --> 01:05:55.996]  Why?
[01:05:56.016 --> 01:05:58.958]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:05:59.058 --> 01:06:03.981]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:06:52.859 --> 01:06:57.902]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.283 --> 01:07:00.584]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:11.511]  Alright, we're talking to Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:07:12.712 --> 01:07:16.575]  And Craig, you were continuing to talk about these latest memos that came out.
[01:07:18.516 --> 01:07:21.538]  Then we're going to get into Oklahoma City and a bunch of other police state issues, but
[01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:27.830]  We were talking about how they're now not just going to have the National Guard in for two years active duty.
[01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:30.993]  They're talking about four years perhaps indefinite.
[01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:34.617]  We were talking about the different psychological effects of this fatigue.
[01:07:34.977 --> 01:07:37.179]  I mean, this has not been done before in modern history.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:45.728]  Even in World War II, you had to fly 22 missions, but then that was it unless you volunteered for more, and few did, over Europe.
[01:07:47.287 --> 01:07:49.810]  I mean, take Vietnam where you were, or Korea.
[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.794]  I mean, you only had to be there for 11 and a half months.
[01:07:54.514 --> 01:07:56.777]  But break this down for us.
[01:07:56.817 --> 01:08:02.002]  Go over what this means and your whole assessment of what's happening in Iraq.
[01:08:02.582 --> 01:08:06.066]  Well, again, what we're running into psychologically...
[01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:11.090]  There's a situation that people weren't prepared for when they enlisted in the reserves and the Guard.
[01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:22.453]  Yes, they understand that if you have a war, your job is to put the uniform on, pack your sea bag, and go deal with it for however long it takes, whether it's one year or three years or the duration or whatever.
[01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:32.815]  But they weren't prepared to deal with something like this where they get deployed in third world nations on a foreign legion type operation where
[01:08:33.728 --> 01:08:35.209]  You know, they're taken out of their hometown.
[01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:36.370]  They're taken away from their jobs.
[01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:41.213]  In a small town, you can destroy the entire infrastructure of the town because you take the key personnel out.
[01:08:41.233 --> 01:08:44.095]  You take the young guys who are working, and you pull them out.
[01:08:44.175 --> 01:08:49.338]  You leave the families home without dad and so on, and they end up overseas.
[01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:57.503]  Well, this is fine, but when you keep doing it over and over and over where they can't plan their lives, then you've got a problem because psychologically, they're thinking of other things, too.
[01:08:57.523 --> 01:08:59.965]  They're not only thinking about, I've got to go to war, and it's dangerous.
[01:09:00.025 --> 01:09:00.665]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:09:00.685 --> 01:09:01.146]  That's a given.
[01:09:02.295 --> 01:09:03.403]  I have to leave my family
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.461]  We understand that's a given to a point.
[01:09:06.521 --> 01:09:09.524]  But then it gets to the point that while I'm gone, what happens at home?
[01:09:09.824 --> 01:09:10.965]  Who's going to take care of things?
[01:09:11.005 --> 01:09:12.086]  What if somebody gets sick?
[01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:19.292]  And all my friends that I went to school with, all my neighbors who didn't go in the military, they're sitting at home right now.
[01:09:19.332 --> 01:09:20.313]  They're getting the promotions.
[01:09:20.353 --> 01:09:21.354]  They're getting the education.
[01:09:21.374 --> 01:09:22.575]  They're getting the foot up the ladder.
[01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:24.496]  And I'm on hold over here.
[01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:27.399]  So there's a lot of other things that people don't mention.
[01:09:27.699 --> 01:09:30.321]  The DOD doesn't even think about that these guys are going through.
[01:09:30.641 --> 01:09:32.323]  Plus, we're depleting our reserves.
[01:09:33.464 --> 01:09:35.905]  The enlistment rate in the reserves and guards is going to go down.
[01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:37.086]  That's going to hurt us in the future.
[01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:40.148]  But you and I both know there's a higher agenda at work here as well.
[01:09:40.588 --> 01:09:46.412]  And I think that agenda is that if we send all of our people overseas, there's no one home to watch the chickens.
[01:09:46.852 --> 01:09:58.460]  And that falls back over to Barry McGaffrey's deal when he gave the graduation speech to the KSQ class up in Fort Leavenworth, that if we get deployed overseas on two or more fronts,
[01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:06.774]  And I'm paraphrasing here, that should a national emergency occur at home where we need our military, we will be forced to call upon foreign assets.
[01:10:07.434 --> 01:10:09.196]  Now, foreign assets, obviously, is U.N.
[01:10:09.216 --> 01:10:09.516]  troops.
[01:10:10.356 --> 01:10:18.762]  Now, the biggest problem I've got with this whole scenario is we're not conducting the war in Iraq on a tactical level.
[01:10:19.275 --> 01:10:20.616]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:10:39.225 --> 01:10:41.588]  Well, even so, the thing about it is, we didn't get any answers.
[01:10:59.827 --> 01:11:03.488]  We didn't get any answers back when we asked for them to at least consider doing this.
[01:11:03.948 --> 01:11:09.909]  Then we asked through the Congressman's office, I work for this Congressman, and we asked, why aren't we protecting our southern border?
[01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:14.830]  If you want to use the reserves and National Guard, let's go out and let's do six months on the border.
[01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:20.191]  Let's stop the illegal aliens coming across because we're not worried about the Mexicans, we're worried about who they're bringing with them.
[01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:26.773]  We know, and I've got friends on Border Patrol down there, who have gone into houses, abandoned houses that farmers have just given up and left.
[01:11:26.813 --> 01:11:28.133]  They said, I can't even live here anymore.
[01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:35.905]  And they've gone into these abandoned houses and these ranches and they found prayer rugs and they found Korans and they found notebooks all in Islamic.
[01:11:36.566 --> 01:11:38.249]  These aren't people coming over here to pick fruit.
[01:11:38.775 --> 01:11:39.475]  These are terrorists.
[01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.436]  They're coming across the border.
[01:11:40.456 --> 01:11:43.417]  So if we're going to fight the war on terror, why aren't we starting doing it here?
[01:11:43.657 --> 01:11:45.338]  See, so these questions aren't being answered.
[01:11:45.698 --> 01:11:48.739]  And the more we ask, all we get is silence.
[01:11:49.239 --> 01:11:52.621]  But let's go back to, I mean, it's not just not seeing your family.
[01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:55.121]  I mean, you were on a SWAT team.
[01:11:55.142 --> 01:11:56.162]  You were in Vietnam.
[01:11:56.182 --> 01:11:57.843]  You've been on both sides of this.
[01:11:58.923 --> 01:12:03.785]  Sending people in four days a week to raid hundreds of homes a week
[01:12:04.813 --> 01:12:15.436]  And to go into these houses, to do these raids, I mean, this is serious combat, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.
[01:12:16.096 --> 01:12:21.598]  I mean, all the statistics and studies show that is totally exhausting, and most people can't handle that.
[01:12:22.718 --> 01:12:24.258]  You can't if you just continue to do it.
[01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:27.899]  You can't just leave your flashlight on and expect the batteries to last forever.
[01:12:27.959 --> 01:12:28.700]  It's not going to happen.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.401]  You've got to get people out of those situations and rotate fresh troops through.
[01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:33.861]  But we run into a paradigm here.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.996]  It's kind of a conundrum if we take the experienced guys out
[01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:40.267]  What happens is there's a bell curve.
[01:12:40.287 --> 01:12:42.449]  When you first get into combat, you're in the learning curve.
[01:12:42.829 --> 01:12:48.533]  So the first, say, half of the time you're there, you're learning how to protect yourself and your buddies and fight the battle.
[01:12:48.933 --> 01:12:52.676]  And the second half of the time there, you lose less casualties because you guys are veterans now.
[01:12:53.176 --> 01:13:00.642]  But you have the new guys coming in, and the people who get hurt most normally are the new people because they're the ones that make the mistakes because they haven't learned yet.
[01:13:00.662 --> 01:13:05.545]  And you've got to have a certain amount of veterans there to teach these guys their survival skills in combat.
[01:13:05.565 --> 01:13:06.766]  You actually develop veterans.
[01:13:07.226 --> 01:13:07.927]  Sixth sense.
[01:13:07.987 --> 01:13:09.027]  I call it jungle sense.
[01:13:09.387 --> 01:13:26.376]  When I was in Vietnam, we got to where, after about six months of being in the bush, we got to where I could tell you, Alex, if we were on a patrol that there was a trip wire 25 yards ahead or there was a punji pad to put off to the side of the road, I could tell you if there was a sniper in a tree line over there because the hair would just stand up in the back of my neck and I just knew it.
[01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:26.977]  It was like this.
[01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:34.721]  You know, you go in a restaurant and you know as well as I do, being a personality, you sit down, you know when somebody's staring at you and you don't have to look at them.
[01:13:35.386 --> 01:13:37.010]  Well, you turn around and they're looking at you.
[01:13:37.331 --> 01:13:37.511]  Right.
[01:13:37.752 --> 01:13:39.657]  Or you automatically look up and they're looking at you.
[01:13:39.817 --> 01:13:43.106]  Yeah, but you know it before you ever look that you're being watched.
[01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:48.671]  That's the same type of sixth sense that people develop in combat or police officers develop in the field.
[01:13:48.711 --> 01:13:52.032]  They can get out of a car and they start to walk up to the car and they know something's wrong.
[01:13:52.412 --> 01:13:53.312]  Something's wrong with that car.
[01:13:53.332 --> 01:13:54.332]  I think the guy's got a gun.
[01:13:54.853 --> 01:13:57.413]  Rookies get killed because they haven't developed that yet.
[01:13:57.473 --> 01:13:58.793]  Same thing on rookies in combat.
[01:13:58.813 --> 01:14:06.075]  Until they get geared and psychologically prepared and plus gain experience, they make mistakes.
[01:14:06.457 --> 01:14:09.501]  And the thing about it is, you usually get like, I've got friends over there that have gotten hurt.
[01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.603]  The guy's a master sergeant.
[01:14:10.983 --> 01:14:13.426]  Okay, the mistake was made by his PFC driver.
[01:14:14.027 --> 01:14:14.528]  Not him.
[01:14:14.768 --> 01:14:16.330]  He was trying to tell them not to do something.
[01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:18.213]  They did it, and they both got blown up.
[01:14:18.929 --> 01:14:25.574]  And they didn't get killed, but they were pretty seriously injured because the young guy made the mistake, not the old guy.
[01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:33.760]  So we do need some veterans over there, but we don't need everybody to stay there all the time and be worn down to where we have no military left.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.281]  That's a waste of assets.
[01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:47.070]  Let me stop you, and I understand that you can be called up any time, so you have to be careful about what you say, but they're having whole groups of troops now quit...
[01:14:47.902 --> 01:14:53.063]  And then the media goes and looks at it, and it's true, where half their guns don't work.
[01:14:53.563 --> 01:14:54.804]  And they're saying, well, it doesn't matter.
[01:14:55.444 --> 01:15:01.125]  We're sending you back, and it doesn't matter if your gun is failing half the time you shoot it.
[01:15:01.585 --> 01:15:02.646]  Or we don't care.
[01:15:04.006 --> 01:15:06.146]  Now, that's got to be a major problem.
[01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:09.067]  This is where the cover-ups happen.
[01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:13.108]  The prime example of this was the M16, which I still consider to be a piece of junk.
[01:15:13.989 --> 01:15:18.431]  And guys will argue with me about that, but they didn't carry the M14 like I did, which was a real rifle.
[01:15:18.811 --> 01:15:19.532]  We got to Vietnam.
[01:15:19.552 --> 01:15:20.312]  We had the M14.
[01:15:20.352 --> 01:15:22.133]  We had zero failure rate.
[01:15:22.513 --> 01:15:25.654]  We had maximum accuracy out to 500 meters and beyond.
[01:15:26.275 --> 01:15:27.155]  They never jammed.
[01:15:27.175 --> 01:15:28.596]  They worked real well, just like the M1.
[01:15:28.656 --> 01:15:36.439]  All they were was a modified M1 that shot 7.62mm instead of .30-06, and they had an exposed barrel and a 20-round magazine.
[01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:37.260]  Basically, it was an M1.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.481]  It was a .30-08 instead of a .30-06.
[01:15:39.561 --> 01:15:40.441]  Right, right, 7.62, .30-08.
[01:15:42.597 --> 01:15:47.880]  They came in 67 and started issuing the AR-15, which later became the M-16.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.380]  Well, they made several mistakes.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:53.882]  The government bureaucrats got in there and they tinkered around with the powder and they did this and they did that.
[01:15:53.902 --> 01:15:55.643]  But they basically sent a mouse gun to war.
[01:15:56.424 --> 01:15:58.925]  And it was a total failure.
[01:15:58.965 --> 01:15:59.745]  It got people killed.
[01:15:59.765 --> 01:16:09.630]  There were Marines in Hill 881 and 881 South that were found dead on the side of the hill assaulting this mountain with field-stripped weapons trying to unjam them.
[01:16:10.509 --> 01:16:13.610]  A friend of mine was involved in an investigation on this.
[01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:20.173]  He's the one who reported it, investigated it, and says, we've got to do something to get this thing off the battlefield until it's fixed or get it out of here and give us our M14s back.
[01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:21.033]  This was in the Marine Corps.
[01:16:22.133 --> 01:16:25.855]  It got up about two levels in command and got roadblocked.
[01:16:26.075 --> 01:16:32.437]  The more they tried to fight it, the more they were told, you'll ruin your career if you do anything about this.
[01:16:32.577 --> 01:16:33.538]  So just be quiet.
[01:16:33.578 --> 01:16:34.138]  It'll be fixed.
[01:16:34.158 --> 01:16:34.698]  Don't worry about it.
[01:16:34.718 --> 01:16:37.659]  While it's being fixed, I'm losing Marines over here.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.760]  As an example, what they did
[01:16:42.188 --> 01:16:44.450]  My friend made major and then he was forced to retire.
[01:16:45.411 --> 01:16:47.674]  In the Marine Corps, most officers can make major.
[01:16:47.694 --> 01:16:48.575]  To make lieutenant colonel,
[01:16:49.162 --> 01:16:53.966]  You better have all your ducks in a row and not have any black marks and get a little gold star.
[01:16:54.207 --> 01:16:56.388]  Because it's a very small organization compared to the Army.
[01:16:56.629 --> 01:17:00.532]  The Army is almost as bad politically as well because you don't make waves.
[01:17:00.552 --> 01:17:10.360]  Well, come to find out, in the case of the M16, instead of having rifles that were built by subcontractors scattered all over the country like all of our other weapons had been built by...
[01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:14.903]  Colt Firearms had bought the whole thing from Armalite.
[01:17:15.184 --> 01:17:20.587]  And so Colt Firearms was the sole manufacturer for the first time in American history of all infantry weapons.
[01:17:20.867 --> 01:17:26.991]  Colt Firearms just happened to be in the pocket of a guy named Robert McNamara, who was Secretary of Defense.
[01:17:28.012 --> 01:17:29.693]  Bell Helicopters, same type of issue.
[01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:33.475]  We had helicopters over there getting shot down right and left and getting replaced right and left.
[01:17:33.495 --> 01:17:36.237]  We lost 6,000 helicopters altogether in Vietnam.
[01:17:36.884 --> 01:17:44.448]  And it was 90% of them being made by Bell Helicopter Textron, which was a part of the trust of Lyndon Bain's Johnson wife, Lady Bird.
[01:17:45.028 --> 01:17:52.953]  So when we start getting up and finding out that we're not allowed to fix the stuff that's broken, I look real hard at who's making the money here.
[01:17:53.433 --> 01:17:53.973]  The Humvees.
[01:17:54.173 --> 01:17:55.694]  Who's making the money off the Humvees?
[01:17:55.734 --> 01:18:01.637]  Well, I've read that even if you armor them, it doesn't protect them, that it's not meant to be in combat.
[01:18:01.918 --> 01:18:04.279]  No, you know, that's like trying to armor a duck.
[01:18:05.119 --> 01:18:05.960]  You know, it's a Jeep.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.100]  Give me a break here.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.881]  This thing is a horrible piece of equipment.
[01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:13.582]  It's too big to go in the woods and go off the road very far.
[01:18:13.662 --> 01:18:17.624]  It's okay out in the deserts for hauling a lot of gear, and yeah, it's got a lot of neat whistles and bells.
[01:18:17.644 --> 01:18:19.425]  But Arnold Schwarzenegger likes it.
[01:18:20.285 --> 01:18:22.766]  Yeah, so does half the Hollywood limo services now.
[01:18:23.426 --> 01:18:24.847]  But that doesn't make it a good vehicle.
[01:18:24.927 --> 01:18:31.433]  It replaced the M151 and a few other trucks, but the M151 was a small, like a jeep, where you could actually go through the woods.
[01:18:31.793 --> 01:18:32.934]  I had a reconnaissance platoon.
[01:18:33.514 --> 01:18:36.516]  We had 12 of them where they had machine guns mounted in the back on pedestals.
[01:18:36.557 --> 01:18:44.222]  We could drive those things anywhere, but they ran on gas and not diesel fuel, and so that was a strike against them because the military wanted to go to diesel fuel, multi-fuel.
[01:18:45.183 --> 01:18:46.264]  Well, stop there.
[01:18:46.344 --> 01:18:47.065]  I want to come back.
[01:18:47.405 --> 01:18:50.648]  Colonel, I want to come back and shift gears into Oklahoma City.
[01:18:50.668 --> 01:18:51.048]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:57.063]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[01:18:57.784 --> 01:19:01.287]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[01:19:01.888 --> 01:19:05.392]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:08.642]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[01:19:08.662 --> 01:19:11.523]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[01:19:12.023 --> 01:19:13.444]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[01:19:14.144 --> 01:19:15.865]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[01:19:16.425 --> 01:19:17.365]  Check with your doctor.
[01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:22.387]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[01:19:22.847 --> 01:19:27.549]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.070]  Light up your life.
[01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:31.851]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the Northern Lights.

[01:19:47.439 --> 01:19:49.781]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:55.166]  The Real Money Folks.
[01:20:01.576 --> 01:20:04.918]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:06.939]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[01:20:07.519 --> 01:20:11.622]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:11.642 --> 01:20:13.363]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:20:26.218 --> 01:20:26.898]  We're good to go.
[01:20:26.938 --> 01:20:27.499]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.012 --> 01:20:56.493]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:20:56.753 --> 01:21:00.255]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:21:04.516 --> 01:21:10.678]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:21:11.078 --> 01:21:18.981]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:21:19.401 --> 01:21:24.743]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:21:24.903 --> 01:21:28.664]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:29.044 --> 01:21:30.944]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:21:30.964 --> 01:21:33.145]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:21:33.365 --> 01:21:38.307]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:22:55.729 --> 01:23:01.754]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:05.377]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:13.565]  All right, I've got a whole host of issues that I want to talk about with my good friend Craig Roberts.
[01:23:15.217 --> 01:23:16.818]  And I know you want to get involved on air.
[01:23:16.838 --> 01:23:18.838]  We've got callers still holding from the last hour.
[01:23:18.878 --> 01:23:20.019]  We'll get to you in the next segment.
[01:23:20.039 --> 01:23:23.740]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.040]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.301]  Craig's website is RifleWarrior.com.
[01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:29.481]  I'll tell you more about that a little bit later.
[01:23:30.562 --> 01:23:40.445]  Craig, I want to talk about Oklahoma City, because you really are an expert on this, and I've interviewed probably 50 people on the subject, but you work the case.
[01:23:41.318 --> 01:23:44.242]  You've got basically the same views that I've got from the evidence.
[01:23:44.722 --> 01:23:46.664]  Clearly a government bombing.
[01:23:46.724 --> 01:23:48.526]  Clearly government involvement.
[01:23:49.648 --> 01:23:52.351]  That is criminal elements of the Clinton administration.
[01:23:53.588 --> 01:24:00.292]  And now we've got American Free Press reporting on something that you covered years ago, but they've even got more government documents now.
[01:24:00.832 --> 01:24:03.913]  OKC bombshell implicates feds in Murrah blast.
[01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:06.735]  And I covered this yesterday with Pat Shannon.
[01:24:07.055 --> 01:24:14.519]  The reason I'm covering it again today is because Oklahoma City is even a clearer inside job than September 11th.
[01:24:15.752 --> 01:24:21.056]  And it really shows us with their pants down what they're up to.
[01:24:21.716 --> 01:24:29.282]  And I want to specifically get into Harry Everhart, this high-level BATF individual assigned to the National Security Council.
[01:24:31.783 --> 01:24:32.764]  Tell folks about this.
[01:24:33.144 --> 01:24:44.933]  Well, I don't have a whole lot on Harry Everhart other than the fact that on day one, everybody has to understand, and you see it all the time,
[01:24:46.002 --> 01:24:51.686]  Anytime something happens on the news, the only good information you get is day one, hour one.
[01:24:52.186 --> 01:25:01.012]  And then after that, key items of the news disappear or they get glossed over or explained away to where by day two, it's not even the same story anymore.
[01:25:02.167 --> 01:25:04.208]  You know, TW800, prime deal.
[01:25:04.288 --> 01:25:12.833]  On day one, it was a terrorist event, and it was a missile, and by day three, they didn't know what it was, and eventually it was a center fuel tank, and the plane decided to blow itself up one day, committed suicide.
[01:25:13.754 --> 01:25:19.817]  Oklahoma City, on day one, there's so many things that happened just in the first three to four hours.
[01:25:20.347 --> 01:25:24.588]  Well, in the first three minutes, BATF runs up and says, we were told not to go in the building.
[01:25:24.829 --> 01:25:25.949]  That's the first thing that happened.
[01:25:26.269 --> 01:25:36.533]  And then a guy that doesn't even live in Oklahoma City, who's part of a National Security Council secret drill doing truck bombs out in the desert, is there and phones it into the media, going, it's an ANFO bomb.
[01:25:36.553 --> 01:25:37.313]  Pretty suspicious.
[01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:41.234]  There's two things that... Well, actually, there's several things that happened exactly at the same time.
[01:25:41.294 --> 01:25:46.656]  Right at 902 and 903, 904 area of that morning of the 19th of April of 95.
[01:25:47.016 --> 01:25:49.317]  One of the things that happened...
[01:25:50.758 --> 01:25:58.968]  Well, just before the Ryder truck shows up out front, of course the Ryder front truck, for those that haven't followed this, was the red herring.
[01:25:59.449 --> 01:26:01.171]  The Ryder truck was, this is what did it.
[01:26:01.912 --> 01:26:05.957]  This is the Lee Harvey McVeigh truck, Carcano found in the bookstore.
[01:26:06.978 --> 01:26:10.062]  This is going to build our case and we'll pin it on whoever we need to later.
[01:26:10.563 --> 01:26:19.305]  When in actual fact, we all know now, and we knew then, that there were other explosive charges already inside the building that had gone off before the truck was detonated.
[01:26:20.605 --> 01:26:26.767]  We have since tracked down some of the people that were involved in placing those charges according to eyewitnesses.
[01:26:27.167 --> 01:26:28.807]  But yet the federal government doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:26:28.827 --> 01:26:29.888]  They don't want to even hear about it.
[01:26:29.908 --> 01:26:31.168]  They're doing the three monkey routine.
[01:26:32.722 --> 01:26:45.889]  At the same time, at 9.02 and 9.03, right afterwards, the explosion goes off, and right afterwards, there were people who showed up wearing black SWAT uniforms that we were told were ATF guys.
[01:26:46.763 --> 01:26:49.185]  And then we were told that ATF wasn't in the building that day.
[01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:52.007]  Then we were told that, though, there were some ATF in the building that day.
[01:26:52.027 --> 01:26:54.709]  And I'm on the law enforcement of this deal, and we're getting these stories.
[01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:59.012]  We have several different vehicle descriptions.
[01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:08.919]  One was a brown GMC pickup leaving the scene at high rate of speed with two to three Middle Eastern males in it wearing blue jogging suits that had left the front door of the building that had held the parking place for the Ryder truck.
[01:27:08.979 --> 01:27:11.121]  But the FBI doesn't want to hear about that by day three.
[01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:15.804]  We've got the Eberhardt story now that's coming out.
[01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:22.071]  That he was involved in calling in that it was an ANFO bomb.
[01:27:22.191 --> 01:27:24.992]  Well, when this thing first went off, guess what, Alex?
[01:27:25.012 --> 01:27:27.293]  For the first 20 minutes, it wasn't a bombing.
[01:27:27.874 --> 01:27:34.817]  For the first 20 minutes here in Oklahoma that never got outside of the state, you may be hearing this here for the first time, it was a natural gas explosion.
[01:27:35.576 --> 01:27:39.398]  I was sitting in a barber chair and saw it within a minute of it going off.
[01:27:39.479 --> 01:27:41.880]  They had cameras pointed in Oklahoma City toward it.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.041]  Here's this giant black column of smoke going up.
[01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:45.822]  And I saw a helicopter fly by.
[01:27:45.842 --> 01:27:47.804]  I later found out it was the police helicopter.
[01:27:47.844 --> 01:27:50.645]  That's your black helicopter, by the way, that flew over the building.
[01:27:50.705 --> 01:27:56.189]  It flew over just right afterwards because as soon as it went off, they were dispatched to see what it was and check on traffic control.
[01:27:56.389 --> 01:27:57.509]  I talked to the pilot myself.
[01:27:59.351 --> 01:28:01.392]  So it was a natural gas explosion for 20 minutes.
[01:28:01.432 --> 01:28:04.854]  So all of a sudden, 20 minutes later, no, it was a car bomb.
[01:28:05.918 --> 01:28:08.980]  And somebody down there said, no, that's too big for a car bomb.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.461]  So then, now the FBI by now is on the scene.
[01:28:11.761 --> 01:28:15.242]  And they're saying, and the ATF as well, has all of a sudden started showing up from home.
[01:28:15.783 --> 01:28:22.346]  And it goes into a station wagon, then a truck, and it just kept growing in size over the next day or so.
[01:28:23.346 --> 01:28:23.766]  Stay there.
[01:28:23.806 --> 01:28:25.227]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:28:26.648 --> 01:28:32.791]  On the other side of this quick break, the websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:34.361 --> 01:28:37.905]  A lot of new updates there at PrisonPlanet.tv, so be sure and check it out.
[01:28:43.712 --> 01:28:44.613]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.094 --> 01:28:46.695]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.616 --> 01:28:50.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.539 --> 01:28:57.422]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:28:57.662 --> 01:29:03.106]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:29:03.366 --> 01:29:13.753]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:29:13.913 --> 01:29:18.236]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:26.806]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:29:27.066 --> 01:29:33.353]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:29:33.353 --> 01:29:35.435]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:29:35.455 --> 01:29:35.635]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:29:55.606 --> 01:30:01.088]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:01.508 --> 01:30:05.749]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:30:05.969 --> 01:30:13.011]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:13.391 --> 01:30:19.493]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:19.633 --> 01:30:20.853]  There are no side effects.
[01:30:20.933 --> 01:30:21.514]  We're good to go.
[01:30:37.976 --> 01:30:41.118]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[01:30:41.479 --> 01:30:42.319]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:30:42.379 --> 01:30:42.639]  Call today.
[01:30:53.999 --> 01:30:55.440]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.982]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:30:58.342 --> 01:30:59.223]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:00.824]  Oil War III has started.
[01:31:01.124 --> 01:31:03.546]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:31:03.966 --> 01:31:07.368]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:31:07.789 --> 01:31:11.611]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:31:11.871 --> 01:31:13.132]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:18.056]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:31:18.496 --> 01:31:22.479]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:28.903]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:31:29.163 --> 01:31:35.247]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:31:35.767 --> 01:31:36.348]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:31:36.368 --> 01:31:42.011]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:31:42.451 --> 01:31:42.692]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:42.712 --> 01:31:44.373]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:31:44.393 --> 01:31:44.713]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:32:01.719 --> 01:32:06.923]  I hope that Colonel Roberts can stay with us into the next hour, because we're going to have Jack McClam on as well.
[01:32:07.984 --> 01:32:14.870]  I've got a bunch of news issues and key information I want to go over, but your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:17.612]  For those that just joined us, high-level FBI agent Danny Coulson
[01:32:26.417 --> 01:32:35.939]  Said that he was in Dallas on April 19th, 1995, and told Newsweek and Time Magazine this, and said, oh, I didn't take a plane, I decided to drive up there.
[01:32:37.139 --> 01:32:39.920]  Because, again, he didn't have a record of how he really got there.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:43.541]  Then it turns out, with the hotel receipts, he was really there the night before.
[01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:49.022]  And so he was there to direct things and get the official story out.
[01:32:49.502 --> 01:32:52.983]  But then on top of it, we have Harry Everhart.
[01:32:54.814 --> 01:33:04.881]  And he witnessed the blast from nearby and called the BATF office in Dallas to excitedly announce someone has just blown up the federal building in Oklahoma City with a truckload of info.
[01:33:05.341 --> 01:33:06.682]  He did this within ten minutes.
[01:33:07.283 --> 01:33:10.105]  He was part of a secret, and Congress has now released this.
[01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:10.725]  This is public.
[01:33:12.017 --> 01:33:28.242]  Part of a secret National Security Council set of drills and tests they did, practicing blowing up cars, trucks, and vans out in the New Mexico desert in the 12 months preceding the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:33:29.323 --> 01:33:31.243]  Now imagine, he doesn't live in Oklahoma.
[01:33:31.704 --> 01:33:41.567]  He's there, on the scene, there, when it blows up and calls it in to the BATF, who then calls it into the media and, oh, it's an ANFO bomb.
[01:33:42.643 --> 01:33:45.124]  Now, think of the chances of that.
[01:33:45.424 --> 01:33:49.945]  Why is Danny Colson, this high-level FBI agent, over anti-terrorism operations?
[01:33:50.305 --> 01:33:52.746]  Why is he there and then lying about being there?
[01:33:54.147 --> 01:33:56.467]  Why is all this happening and going on?
[01:33:56.487 --> 01:34:06.750]  And I would add to this, Colonel Roberts, on 9-11, we have National Security Council doing a CIA-controlled drill of flying jets into buildings in New York and D.C.
[01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:08.691]  NORAD is told it's a drill.
[01:34:08.771 --> 01:34:12.212]  Air traffic controllers in the civilian area say, is this a drill?
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.761]  They think it's part of the drill.
[01:34:16.703 --> 01:34:20.806]  Vigilant Guardian and Tripod and all of these, same thing.
[01:34:20.906 --> 01:34:21.326]  Putin.
[01:34:21.987 --> 01:34:26.530]  They blow up three apartment buildings in 99 to get martial law going and to attack the Chechens.
[01:34:27.051 --> 01:34:35.858]  Moscow police in a sting catch FSB planting bombs, hydrogen bombs, in a fourth apartment building, and then Putin goes, oh, it was just a drill.
[01:34:35.898 --> 01:34:41.262]  So it looks to me like they are always doing these drills over the operation because it's
[01:34:41.937 --> 01:34:50.540]  Highly compartmentalized and specialized in case other law enforcement breaks through the wall or citizens report it and they get busted.
[01:34:51.701 --> 01:34:53.061]  Give us your analysis of this.
[01:34:53.622 --> 01:35:07.687]  Well, looking at that part as the author of the Medusa file, as an investigative journalist, the questions I would be looking at on that, and I think the answer would be that if you and I were going to plan to do something
[01:35:08.613 --> 01:35:17.216]  Then we would be able to plan a cover for it as well that if the actual operation failed and we got caught in it, we could say, well, it was just a drill.
[01:35:17.356 --> 01:35:18.237]  We were just practicing.
[01:35:18.277 --> 01:35:19.337]  Here's the documentation.
[01:35:19.377 --> 01:35:20.797]  We've been planning this for a year.
[01:35:21.338 --> 01:35:23.739]  And I think that what it is, it's a fallback position.
[01:35:23.779 --> 01:35:24.919]  It's also a false flag.
[01:35:24.939 --> 01:35:27.800]  And it also muddies the water later on if everything goes well.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.901]  They'd say, well, gee, we were just ahead of our time.
[01:35:29.921 --> 01:35:31.661]  We were thinking about what was going to happen.
[01:35:32.242 --> 01:35:33.262]  And, gee, it did.
[01:35:33.934 --> 01:35:34.794]  Isn't that a coincidence?
[01:35:34.834 --> 01:35:39.655]  The problem is, how many coincidences in a row do you need before you realize something else is afoot here?
[01:35:39.675 --> 01:35:45.697]  Well, why would Danny Colson lie and say he was in Dallas when it's now admitted he was in Oklahoma?
[01:35:45.837 --> 01:35:48.857]  He was probably told to.
[01:35:48.877 --> 01:35:52.158]  I mean, if he was in Oklahoma, he could have come up with a story that he was there for a meeting.
[01:35:52.218 --> 01:35:52.598]  So what?
[01:35:53.198 --> 01:35:56.339]  But if you say you're in Dallas, why did they not want him in Oklahoma?
[01:35:57.097 --> 01:36:06.866]  As far as the official version... But what's the chances of having somebody who lives in New York City being there outside the building when the bomb goes off?
[01:36:07.087 --> 01:36:12.031]  Who ran the test for a National Security Council drill?
[01:36:12.051 --> 01:36:14.353]  I mean, what's the chances of that, Craig?
[01:36:14.594 --> 01:36:15.795]  Slim and probably nil.
[01:36:18.057 --> 01:36:19.058]  That's a heck of a lead.
[01:36:19.668 --> 01:36:23.031]  And that's another one of the unanswered questions.
[01:36:23.251 --> 01:36:33.459]  Well, you say you don't know much about this character, but you were the first person years and years and years ago who talked about the government drill blowing up the trucks.
[01:36:33.939 --> 01:36:48.831]  Well, yeah, and we knew that that had been going on, and they were trying to figure out how much it would take to cause certain amounts of blast damage at a certain radius using different types of explosives, and one of them was ammonium nitrate fertilizer soaked with diesel fuel or whatever in the back of a moving van.
[01:36:49.695 --> 01:36:50.276]  And they filmed it.
[01:36:50.396 --> 01:36:53.597]  I think it was even on one of the TV magazine shows.
[01:36:54.038 --> 01:36:56.299]  Yeah, they had a Discovery Channel show about it.
[01:36:56.699 --> 01:37:06.264]  But when it was brought to their attention by bomb experts that that truck doing that according to their own data could not have done this damage to the Murr Building, all of a sudden that story evaporated.
[01:37:07.065 --> 01:37:16.870]  Because what they tried to do is they tried to use that to show that McVeigh and this truck did this damage, and here we experimented out in the desert, and you can see how big of an explosion this is.
[01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:18.231]  But when they actually analyzed it,
[01:37:18.587 --> 01:37:21.829]  Well, the problem with that is, now what do we do that we show that it can't happen?
[01:37:21.889 --> 01:37:22.569]  So that whole story
[01:37:39.218 --> 01:37:40.478]  Well, here's another example.
[01:37:40.518 --> 01:37:50.161]  They've got all the different giant 18-wheeler tractor trailers full of plastic explosives parked right up against buildings, and all it does is blow the face off of them.
[01:37:50.381 --> 01:37:54.102]  Well, look at the Kovar Towers, and that was my key point at one of the FBI meetings I went to.
[01:37:54.602 --> 01:38:03.324]  I stood there in front of a whole room full of guys, and I said, Hey, I don't know if you have any experience in explosives, but let me just give you an example that you can understand.
[01:38:03.784 --> 01:38:09.089]  Here are the pictures of the Murrah Building with what's supposed to be ammonium nitrate, which is low-order explosives.
[01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:11.771]  It's concussive, but it doesn't have a lot of brisms.
[01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:13.232]  And it's pushed.
[01:38:13.492 --> 01:38:14.133]  It's pushed.
[01:38:14.293 --> 01:38:15.094]  It dissipates.
[01:38:15.134 --> 01:38:16.195]  Right.
[01:38:16.515 --> 01:38:18.637]  I was trying to say that and probably didn't do it well.
[01:38:20.458 --> 01:38:21.519]  Sometimes I get too technical.
[01:38:21.559 --> 01:38:24.221]  But you look at the Kovar Towers.
[01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:25.983]  They drive up with a tanker truck.
[01:38:26.568 --> 01:38:32.232]  Full of Semtex, which is basically C4, which is plastic explosives, which is a high explosive like Dekort.
[01:38:32.693 --> 01:38:36.816]  Doesn't that have like five times the yield of ammonium nitrate?
[01:38:36.836 --> 01:38:39.178]  Oh, probably about 15 times the yield.
[01:38:39.298 --> 01:38:41.380]  And they put it right up in front of the building.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:42.440]  They set it off.
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:44.362]  It puts an 80-foot crater in the ground.
[01:38:44.402 --> 01:38:46.664]  It's 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide.
[01:38:46.984 --> 01:38:52.968]  And all it did was blow the front of the facade of the building off, opened up some of the rooms, didn't even rearrange the furniture.
[01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:56.111]  And hardly, I don't know if anybody even got hurt in the thing, but...
[01:38:56.693 --> 01:39:07.136]  This giant explosive went off, and that's all it did, to a building made in Saudi Arabia with poor concrete, very little reinforcing, mostly sandcast.
[01:39:07.856 --> 01:39:11.377]  And then you put that up against the Murrah building.
[01:39:12.797 --> 01:39:14.298]  This dog just doesn't hunt.
[01:39:15.754 --> 01:39:25.896]  Well, plus you have the building blown out, columns further back, blasted off with clean blast points, and General Parton did an examination just of the photos, and it's like, here's the blast points.
[01:39:26.156 --> 01:39:27.556]  Well, yeah, you could find them on the columns.
[01:39:27.596 --> 01:39:28.936]  That's why they got rid of the building so quick.
[01:39:28.956 --> 01:39:30.957]  They didn't want experts coming in there looking at the columns.
[01:39:31.817 --> 01:39:34.757]  You've got Jane Graham who says she saw Andrea Strassmeyer.
[01:39:34.817 --> 01:39:41.018]  She saw some guy named Gary Lewis, I think was his name, and she identified him, picked him out of photos, said, these are the guys I saw in the building.
[01:39:41.038 --> 01:39:42.999]  And she was the head of HUD in the building.
[01:39:43.339 --> 01:39:44.419]  And she described...
[01:39:45.001 --> 01:39:46.001]  What they were wearing.
[01:39:46.041 --> 01:39:56.464]  Strassmeyer had on a black cowboy suit and black cowboy boots and a hat, and they had a grocery bag, and they were going around putting putty on the columns and stringing wire.
[01:39:56.484 --> 01:39:57.984]  She said grain butter, yeah.
[01:39:58.004 --> 01:40:08.747]  Yeah, and I interviewed her extensively, and she described something along the lines of C4 or Semtex, some type of plastic explosive.
[01:40:08.787 --> 01:40:14.428]  She thought they were putting up a temporary telephone line between the columns, and when they saw her, they threw the stuff in the back of the station wagon and took off.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:21.581]  We have flashlights in the building the night before while surveillance is being held on the building.
[01:40:21.601 --> 01:40:26.482]  They've got flashlights going around inside the building the night before at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:26.882]  That's right.
[01:40:26.902 --> 01:40:32.364]  There's surveillance on the building because people are going to federal courthouses and places like Denver going.
[01:40:32.384 --> 01:40:34.504]  They're going to blow the Murrow building up in the next month.
[01:40:34.584 --> 01:40:36.625]  Oh, there's no doubt there was surveillance on the building that day.
[01:40:36.645 --> 01:40:43.186]  You've got guys who witnessed people coming out on the sidewalk and holding hoops over their head like hula hoops and turning around like they're trying to...
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.080]  I think so.
[01:40:57.729 --> 01:41:10.093]  It does a delivery and then drives off and you've got the two guys in blue jogging suits that run out and hold the parking place for McVeigh to drive up in front of because he's parked a block away and has gotten out of the truck in front of the post office, okay?
[01:41:10.813 --> 01:41:17.556]  I saw the surveillance photograph of the UPS truck parked in front of the building just before 9 o'clock.
[01:41:17.856 --> 01:41:24.618]  And again, Colonel Roberts, you don't just wander in the federal buildings planting explosives unless you're authorized.
[01:41:25.038 --> 01:41:27.620]  Well, either that or you've got really terrible security.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.441]  But go back to what I just said, because it always goes over everybody's head.
[01:41:30.862 --> 01:41:33.063]  I saw the surveillance photographs.
[01:41:33.143 --> 01:41:40.947]  They were taken from an Oklahoma County Sheriff's stakeout car of that building prior to the Ryder truck arriving.
[01:41:40.988 --> 01:41:43.829]  That means they had it staked out, which means Key was right.
[01:41:43.869 --> 01:41:45.070]  The government had foreknowledge.
[01:41:46.983 --> 01:41:47.784]  Well, absolutely.
[01:41:47.824 --> 01:41:48.465]  That's admitted.
[01:41:48.546 --> 01:41:51.049]  Now, I mean, so this doesn't go over people's heads.
[01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:53.413]  And I'm not being like, oh, folks, you're stupid.
[01:41:53.453 --> 01:41:56.899]  I mean, so this really burns into our brains.
[01:41:57.734 --> 01:42:17.591]  We've got this high-level BATF officer assigned to the National Security Council there, who's been doing a test, blowing up truck bombs in the year before this, there, doesn't live there, on the scene, and he's the guy that calls the government and the media saying it's an ANFO bomb.
[01:42:17.651 --> 01:42:19.592]  I mean, that is ridiculous, folks.
[01:42:19.653 --> 01:42:21.694]  If you can't see what that means, you're blind.
[01:42:22.175 --> 01:42:25.978]  Well, especially when they hadn't even decided it wasn't natural gas explosion yet.
[01:42:26.693 --> 01:42:28.555]  So you had to have a premeditated story.
[01:42:29.616 --> 01:42:31.859]  You know, you had to have your storyline already written down in style.
[01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:35.463]  Greg, how do they get people in government to do stuff like this?
[01:42:35.503 --> 01:42:37.946]  I mean, I guess they're just criminals to begin with.
[01:42:37.966 --> 01:42:40.129]  I mean, this is just so cold-blooded.
[01:42:40.829 --> 01:42:43.913]  I mean, how many children died in that daycare center?
[01:42:44.374 --> 01:42:44.894]  Well, I don't know.
[01:42:44.914 --> 01:42:45.335]  There was 168 altogether.
[01:42:47.278 --> 01:42:48.579]  50-something children, I think.
[01:42:49.179 --> 01:42:50.300]  But, I mean, this is the thing.
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:52.301]  The BATF, admittedly, wasn't in the building.
[01:42:52.321 --> 01:42:55.902]  They told police and firemen, I've got them in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:42:56.063 --> 01:42:57.043]  This is months after.
[01:42:57.063 --> 01:43:03.646]  You know, it isn't like it was just a story that day going, yeah, BATF came up two minutes after in bomb gear and said, oh, we were told not to go into the building.
[01:43:04.907 --> 01:43:08.989]  You know, I could write a book just on Oklahoma City and just the title of it would be Lies.
[01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:13.411]  Because we ran into so many lies on the government side of the house.
[01:43:13.752 --> 01:43:15.633]  But how do these guys kill children?
[01:43:15.653 --> 01:43:16.333]  I mean, I just...
[01:43:17.555 --> 01:43:18.777]  I just don't understand that.
[01:43:19.117 --> 01:43:20.358]  What's wrong with these people?
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:24.403]  Well, whoever was behind this has no compunctions whatsoever.
[01:43:24.423 --> 01:43:26.405]  You and I talked about this in an earlier show.
[01:43:26.445 --> 01:43:31.351]  We kept going up the ladder to the chain of command, and we finally got to the top, and Satan's in charge.
[01:43:31.391 --> 01:43:32.753]  So we're really talking about evil.
[01:43:32.813 --> 01:43:34.074]  And you mention this all the time.
[01:43:34.094 --> 01:43:36.457]  You talk about pure evil exists, and it does.
[01:43:36.497 --> 01:43:38.099]  It is a commodity out here on the streets.
[01:43:38.839 --> 01:43:39.340]  We're good to go.
[01:43:59.597 --> 01:44:02.799]  These people exist not just in the criminal element, but they exist in the government.
[01:44:02.819 --> 01:44:06.022]  There's a lot of criminals that exist in our government nowadays, and we all know about that.
[01:44:06.042 --> 01:44:11.025]  Because criminals start getting in, and they start recruiting more and more of their people, filling up more positions.
[01:44:11.265 --> 01:44:12.026]  It's like fungus.
[01:44:12.206 --> 01:44:14.107]  It's a cancer, and it builds.
[01:44:14.288 --> 01:44:16.769]  And they only recruit the people... You go back to the 60s.
[01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:19.872]  You go back to some of the CIA operations in the early 60s.
[01:44:21.232 --> 01:44:29.015]  And you find people who have no compunction against running drugs in the United States be used by our own school children if they can make money to fight communism.
[01:44:29.075 --> 01:44:30.915]  I mean, this was their justification.
[01:44:30.955 --> 01:44:35.196]  We can go back to Team 101 of the OSS in World War II.
[01:44:35.236 --> 01:44:40.658]  It was led by E. Howard Hunt, and they had Lucien Conine on it, Paul Helliwell, and Mitch Warbell, and some of these guys.
[01:44:40.998 --> 01:44:47.060]  They were running opium in World War II in the Golden Triangle to support the Kuomintang Army under General Chiang Kai-shek.
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:50.161]  And they justified that because, well, it's war.
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:45:07.684]  And during the Vietnam War, it's recruits from the same bunch that ran the Golden Triangle through the 60s, 70s, 80s, and probably still do today through the Golden Triangle on all the opium coming out now, and all that stuff's ending up in the veins of European and American youth.
[01:45:08.058 --> 01:45:14.464]  The same bunch that runs both the Cali and Medellin cartels, and all of that cocaine comes into the country.
[01:45:14.484 --> 01:45:19.728]  We go back and we look at the stuff that came through back in the 80s during the Reagan administration, when George Bush Sr.
[01:45:19.908 --> 01:45:29.777]  was vice president, and we follow that down through MENA with Clinton, down to Noriega, and the whole Iran-Contra thing, and it was exposed.
[01:45:29.877 --> 01:45:30.918]  I mean, it was documented.
[01:45:30.938 --> 01:45:34.982]  It was blown wide open, and then it just went away, and everybody put their heads back in the sand.
[01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:36.963]  So are there evil people out there?
[01:45:37.044 --> 01:45:37.544]  Absolutely.
[01:45:37.584 --> 01:45:38.745]  Do they work in these agencies?
[01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:39.305]  Yes, they do.
[01:45:39.345 --> 01:45:39.966]  Who do they recruit?
[01:45:40.026 --> 01:45:40.446]  Each other.
[01:45:41.067 --> 01:45:42.688]  And other people like them.
[01:45:42.788 --> 01:45:46.512]  It's a monster that creates its own young as it goes.
[01:45:47.513 --> 01:45:49.654]  And what we have to do is what we do right now.
[01:45:50.115 --> 01:45:50.935]  We educate people.
[01:45:50.996 --> 01:45:51.676]  You talk about it.
[01:45:51.736 --> 01:45:52.377]  I talk about it.
[01:45:52.417 --> 01:45:53.918]  Somebody's got to be fearless and stand up.
[01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:56.040]  Because if we don't have a watchman on the wall, we're going to lose.
[01:45:57.808 --> 01:45:59.450]  Well, and this happens in society.
[01:45:59.490 --> 01:46:02.072]  It's like a viral infection or a bacterial infection.
[01:46:02.112 --> 01:46:04.534]  I like how you use the microscopic example.
[01:46:05.215 --> 01:46:08.337]  And these diseases don't know how to stop.
[01:46:08.357 --> 01:46:10.960]  They keep spreading and finally even kill the host.
[01:46:11.847 --> 01:46:14.249]  And that's exactly what's happening right now.
[01:46:14.369 --> 01:46:16.270]  Our government is not what it used to be.
[01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:19.633]  The host is being killed by cancer within it.
[01:46:19.713 --> 01:46:25.217]  We've got organizations in our government that run drugs, that launder money, that have hit teams.
[01:46:25.577 --> 01:46:27.859]  This has been shown through history over and over and over again.
[01:46:28.199 --> 01:46:31.641]  And when it gets exposed, it's like the deal that happened in California where...
[01:46:33.022 --> 01:46:39.005]  They said that we've got evidence that the CIA has been running drugs into the streets of Los Angeles.
[01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:42.346]  When the CIA comes back and says, well, we investigated that and we found ourselves innocent.
[01:46:43.247 --> 01:46:44.367]  You know, I mean, okay, fine.
[01:46:44.527 --> 01:46:46.068]  That's like getting cancer to cure cancer.
[01:46:46.988 --> 01:46:48.769]  Let's talk to Eric in Oklahoma.
[01:46:48.849 --> 01:46:50.390]  Eric, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:46:54.652 --> 01:46:56.333]  Okay, Joe in Tennessee, you're next.
[01:46:56.353 --> 01:46:56.993]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:47:01.075 --> 01:47:02.919]  You may be having a little glitch with the phone lines.
[01:47:02.979 --> 01:47:05.584]  We'll try to go back to calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:47:06.105 --> 01:47:07.167]  That happens occasionally.
[01:47:07.969 --> 01:47:12.658]  Colonel, you know, I look at this, and then I look at the average cop on the street who's compartmentalized.
[01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:17.795]  And here in Austin, they're having checkpoints all week, just randomly searching vehicles.
[01:47:18.135 --> 01:47:23.080]  And I hear them on the radio, well, it may violate the Fourth Amendment, but we've got to do this to stop crime.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:30.066]  I mean, so you kill America to save America, but then you let the government itself bring the drugs in to create the crisis to begin with?
[01:47:30.567 --> 01:47:35.992]  I mean, what would you say to those police that are getting these federal dollars to run these checkpoints all over the country?
[01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:46.504]  Well, of course, my first question is what happened to the laws that I was trained at the police academy that you can't stop a vehicle without probable cause or reasonable belief that a crime has been committed.
[01:47:46.925 --> 01:47:53.114]  You can't just stop a vehicle because you don't like its color or because you're going to stop the next ten vehicles and see if there's any bad guys inside.
[01:47:54.075 --> 01:47:57.137]  You know, so a stop is a form of arrest.
[01:47:57.217 --> 01:47:59.398]  A form of arrest has to have probable cause.
[01:47:59.438 --> 01:48:00.859]  Where did this fall by the wayside?
[01:48:00.879 --> 01:48:05.941]  You know, that law has never changed, but what they've done is they've written new laws over it.
[01:48:06.362 --> 01:48:09.683]  And they've come up with Homeland Defense stuff, anti-terrorism stuff.
[01:48:09.723 --> 01:48:16.247]  Or they call it the continuation of the force threat continuum, and they say, well, we have a policy.
[01:48:17.508 --> 01:48:21.970]  You know, the IRS has tax rules.
[01:48:22.779 --> 01:48:23.600]  But they're not law.
[01:48:24.261 --> 01:48:27.806]  And we go by them because they say, well, it's in the IRS regulations.
[01:48:27.906 --> 01:48:30.410]  Well, regulations have to do with organizations.
[01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:32.272]  It doesn't have to do with the people itself.
[01:48:35.237 --> 01:48:38.682]  What's happened is we are not taught in our schools anymore
[01:48:39.215 --> 01:48:39.796]  We're good to go.
[01:48:58.993 --> 01:49:00.835]  And by the way, I'm sure you've heard...
[01:49:13.994 --> 01:49:18.856]  I'm sure you've heard, now the TSA is being dispatched to the inauguration in other cities.
[01:49:19.236 --> 01:49:28.580]  They're going to train police how to, quote, profile people with behavioral sciences, and then they're going to have this all over the streets, all over the roads now, Colonel.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.682]  Well, and they're told they're not supposed to profile terrorists because it's not politically correct, you know?
[01:49:33.863 --> 01:49:34.763]  You might offend somebody.
[01:49:37.121 --> 01:49:44.370]  I know the Supreme Court says you can stop everyone, you just can't stop specific people, so everyone must be abused.
[01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:46.953]  That's your freedom, your freedom to be abused.
[01:49:47.253 --> 01:49:49.055]  We'll be right back, folks, with Alan and others.
[01:49:49.075 --> 01:49:49.456]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.431 --> 01:49:57.777]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.957 --> 01:50:02.383]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.523 --> 01:50:06.929]  There is a chance to use this disaster in the New World Order.
[01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:08.291]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.074 --> 01:50:14.298]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.358 --> 01:50:21.306]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.426 --> 01:50:23.429]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.789 --> 01:50:34.236]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.416 --> 01:50:39.800]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:42.962]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:43.042 --> 01:50:44.202]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:53.061 --> 01:50:54.662]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:54.822 --> 01:50:58.944]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.044 --> 01:51:01.945]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.025 --> 01:51:08.748]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:08.908 --> 01:51:11.930]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:14.531]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.631 --> 01:51:22.795]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:24.415]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:51:53.894 --> 01:51:59.823]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:53:02.979 --> 01:53:12.944]  All right, we're about to go to the callers that are patiently holding, Alan, Roger, Steve, Ron, and others.
[01:53:15.185 --> 01:53:21.889]  Before we do that, we're going to have Greg Roberts with us into the next hour, along with, of course, Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[01:53:21.909 --> 01:53:23.270]  I'd like to get the two on together.
[01:53:23.877 --> 01:53:26.198]  It should be for very informative and interesting listening.
[01:53:26.558 --> 01:53:47.526]  Just briefly, please get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, the preeminent 9-11 film that shows you the history of government-sponsored terror from Nero burning part of Rome to blame it on his enemies, to Hitler and the Reichstag, to Operation Northwood, to the Gulf of Tonkin, right through to Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center bombing, through 9-11, and the unfolding police state.
[01:53:47.546 --> 01:53:51.728]  It's almost three hours long on DVD, two and a half hours long on VHS.
[01:53:53.921 --> 01:53:56.264]  $25.95.
[01:53:54.321 --> 01:53:56.264]  Order three or more of any of my 11 films.
[01:53:56.284 --> 01:53:57.826]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:53:58.287 --> 01:54:01.571]  I've got a discount on two of the films right now where you buy one for the regular price.
[01:54:01.952 --> 01:54:03.654]  Each additional is $5.95.
[01:54:03.994 --> 01:54:06.939]  My goal is that you get four or five copies and give them as gifts.
[01:54:07.479 --> 01:54:09.162]  It is waking people up, folks.
[01:54:09.682 --> 01:54:12.647]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[01:54:39.601 --> 01:54:42.582]  And don't forget, you can watch all my videos online.
[01:54:42.602 --> 01:54:46.004]  A lot of new stuff added at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:54:46.044 --> 01:54:52.147]  We're about to go to Alan and others, but Craig, you've written quite a few great books, some of them bestsellers.
[01:54:52.507 --> 01:54:54.928]  People can go to riflewarrior.com and learn more.
[01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:57.551]  How else can they find out about your books?
[01:54:58.412 --> 01:55:07.523]  You can go to my website, like you mentioned, and you can go to any bookstore, and most of them are available now after a huge battle it's taken years to keep it on the computer.
[01:55:09.078 --> 01:55:12.480]  Any special order department can order the Medusa file or Kill Zone.
[01:55:14.301 --> 01:55:16.143]  Those are the main ones we've got out right now.
[01:55:16.163 --> 01:55:19.045]  I've got a new sniper book that just came out this year.
[01:55:19.125 --> 01:55:22.647]  Crosshairs on the Kill Zone that takes up where One Shot One Kill left off.
[01:55:22.847 --> 01:55:24.909]  It's available through any bookstore.
[01:55:24.949 --> 01:55:26.110]  You might want to check that one out.
[01:55:26.150 --> 01:55:27.851]  That goes from Vietnam all the way up to Iraq.
[01:55:28.111 --> 01:55:33.475]  I interviewed all these guys that were snipers in various wars all the way through Somalia, Grenada, Panama, the whole bit.
[01:55:33.735 --> 01:55:35.556]  Great bunch of stories, great bunch of guys.
[01:55:36.036 --> 01:55:36.657]  They're all out there.
[01:55:37.384 --> 01:55:41.045]  All right, let's talk to Alan in Kansas.
[01:55:41.225 --> 01:55:42.006]  Alan, go ahead.
[01:55:42.506 --> 01:55:43.066]  Hello, Alex.
[01:55:43.486 --> 01:55:43.826]  Hello.
[01:55:44.306 --> 01:55:55.310]  And Mr. Roberts, what happened April 19, 1995, we lost quite a bit there in that there was a lot of movement and resistance to any world governance.
[01:55:55.450 --> 01:56:01.792]  And I have here a copy of a resolution by the legislature of Oklahoma that was done in 1994.
[01:56:02.492 --> 01:56:03.913]  I'd like to read just a little bit of it.
[01:56:04.915 --> 01:56:05.595]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:56:06.135 --> 01:56:32.926]  Now, be it resolved by the House representing the second session of the 44th Oklahoma Legislature that the United States Congress is hereby memorialized to, and number four, cease any support for the establishment of a new world order or any form of global government, that the United States Congress is hereby memorialized to refrain from taking any further steps towards the economic or political merger
[01:56:33.462 --> 01:56:35.424]  The United States into a war body.
[01:56:37.046 --> 01:56:38.646]  Let me stop you.
[01:56:38.686 --> 01:56:43.249]  Did you know that New Hampshire was going to have a vote to secede, and it was going to happen?
[01:56:43.269 --> 01:56:46.850]  Their counties were all going along with it the week of 9-11.
[01:56:47.571 --> 01:56:49.171]  I had their state reps on.
[01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:50.432]  I had their mayors on.
[01:56:50.852 --> 01:56:52.693]  It was getting no national attention.
[01:56:53.033 --> 01:56:55.814]  There were bills introduced in Arizona that did the same thing.
[01:56:56.435 --> 01:57:00.997]  And, Craig, that is true, what he just covered, and it goes on and on.
[01:57:01.037 --> 01:57:05.139]  Very interesting that Oklahoma got knocked upside the head after doing that.
[01:57:05.479 --> 01:57:06.642]  Yeah, I remember when that came out.
[01:57:06.662 --> 01:57:07.565]  I've got copies of that.
[01:57:07.645 --> 01:57:12.256]  We were amazed that anybody else even thought about it, much less somebody down in the state legislature.
[01:57:13.963 --> 01:57:15.264]  And he's right.
[01:57:15.304 --> 01:57:25.711]  And, you know, we chased afterwards the big conundrum in this thing was all of a sudden, you know, we're chasing Middle Easterners, and that's what our eyewitnesses talked about.
[01:57:26.251 --> 01:57:32.836]  And then here all of a sudden it switches over to the militia and the right wing and Pat Robertson and Rush Limbaugh and radio talk shows and all this stuff.
[01:57:32.856 --> 01:57:38.920]  And we chase that back, and it goes to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL and the defamation leaving the benign breath.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:39.801]  Absolutely.
[01:57:39.841 --> 01:57:40.461]  Stay there, Alan.
[01:57:40.481 --> 01:57:41.722]  I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.020]  Hello!
[01:57:49.805 --> 01:57:50.465]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.126 --> 01:57:52.207]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.887 --> 01:57:54.008]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:55.509]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.529 --> 01:57:57.090]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.791 --> 01:58:01.454]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:06.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:15.145]  All right, my friends, into this third and final hour of this worldwide edition, the 13th day of January 05.
[01:58:16.446 --> 01:58:18.068]  We're talking to Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:58:19.088 --> 01:58:24.293]  We've got Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order coming on, and obviously loaded phone lines here.
[01:58:24.313 --> 01:58:27.575]  A whole host of other issues now I want to get into with our guest.
[01:58:28.176 --> 01:58:33.220]  But Alan in Kansas was bringing up a really important point.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.742]  He was talking about how Oklahoma passed a law saying
[01:58:36.434 --> 01:58:42.636]  Saying we're not going along with the New World Order and instructing Congress in Washington that they better not go along with it.
[01:58:43.276 --> 01:58:47.678]  And shortly after, there was a huge movement against the UN, the New World Order, everybody was waking up.
[01:58:48.698 --> 01:58:58.702]  There was a huge awakening happening, and boom, Oklahoma City, and then it gets blamed on the Patriots, and then clearly we have government operatives there at the scene, clearly involved.
[01:58:59.442 --> 01:59:01.403]  Anything else you wanted to add, Alan?
[01:59:01.724 --> 01:59:13.191]  Well, you talk about now seeing people wake up, and what I'm trying to say by bringing this up again is during this time in 1994, we had people go to meetings of 1,000, 3,000.
[01:59:13.271 --> 01:59:24.778]  I was one of the 3,000 to 4,000 with people meeting there and discussing these matters about world governance, and there was quite a bit of resistance to world governance at the time, and it was building.
[01:59:25.451 --> 01:59:29.092]  On April 19, 1995, that resistance was quieted.
[01:59:30.272 --> 01:59:34.774]  Because day one, Bill Clinton came out and said it's the evil right-wingers, those who believe in a world government.
[01:59:35.054 --> 01:59:35.814]  Thanks for the call.
[01:59:36.834 --> 01:59:38.115]  I want to get a comment.
[01:59:38.315 --> 01:59:48.237]  Craig Roberts was just talking about this in the last hour, but Jack McClan, I think we're having an even bigger awakening right now, and I think the danger of the globalists carrying out more attacks is higher than ever.
[01:59:48.337 --> 01:59:49.398]  Jack, good to have you on with us.
[01:59:49.538 --> 01:59:50.798]  Good to be back with you, Alex.
[01:59:51.701 --> 01:59:54.504]  And also, Colonel Roberts, good to be back on with you.
[01:59:55.124 --> 01:59:56.846]  Hello, Brother Jack.
[01:59:57.246 --> 01:59:58.448]  Doing okay on this end.
[01:59:58.488 --> 01:59:59.829]  We're sorting tigers up here.
[01:59:59.869 --> 02:00:01.070]  I know you guys are, too.
[02:00:02.471 --> 02:00:12.221]  What do you think about the caller's point of there was a big movement against the New World Order, they passed a law in Oklahoma, and then a few months later they get a building blown up?
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:21.083]  Yes, that certainly did hurt the awakening across the nation, at least those who were willing to stand up.
[02:00:21.163 --> 02:00:25.124]  We had a lot of guys ducked for cover over that, and it's too bad.
[02:00:25.744 --> 02:00:27.525]  But you know, it's always been that way.
[02:00:27.745 --> 02:00:35.668]  As Colonel Roberts knows, when the bullets start flying and the blood starts running, you begin to see who's going to be with you and who's not going to be with you.
[02:00:36.889 --> 02:00:38.250]  Well, you're right.
[02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:46.838]  There's so many of these alleged patriots that were all standing behind podiums and waving flags until then, and then all of a sudden they became scarce commodities.
[02:00:47.118 --> 02:00:47.859]  That's right.
[02:00:47.999 --> 02:00:48.700]  And we can name them.
[02:00:49.441 --> 02:01:00.089]  And what's interesting, Alex, let's go back in time a little bit, rewind the tape here, from 1992 or 1993 up until 1995, there was another phenomenon that was occurring.
[02:01:00.129 --> 02:01:16.962]  Besides militias being formed and all kinds of self-defense forces being contemplated and organized and so on, gun shows were growing and people were buying ammunition because they were so afraid of what the liberals were doing in Washington and so afraid of the Clintons and the globalists and so on,
[02:01:17.362 --> 02:01:19.043]  They were buying ammunition.
[02:01:19.083 --> 02:01:20.904]  They were buying pallet loads of ammunition.
[02:01:20.944 --> 02:01:23.145]  The price didn't matter.
[02:01:23.165 --> 02:01:25.045]  They were buying every gun they could get their hands on.
[02:01:25.146 --> 02:01:33.629]  I saw the Wanamaker Show in Tulsa, the biggest gun show in the world, where people were coming in with hand carts, buying stuff and field gear and rations.
[02:01:34.009 --> 02:01:37.111]  It looked like they were equipping for war right there.
[02:01:37.151 --> 02:01:38.271]  The government got word of this.
[02:01:38.351 --> 02:01:39.692]  I testified before Congress.
[02:01:40.572 --> 02:01:51.820]  On the 5th of April of 1995, against the Brady Bunch and against the Omnibus Crime Control Act that year and so on, in my police uniform, which I got in trouble for, but so be it.
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:53.401]  I've always been a loose cannon.
[02:01:54.017 --> 02:02:03.661]  And when I was in Washington, I was up there for three or four days, and I was escorted around to all kinds of different functions and cocktail parties and so on to talk to the bigwigs and the senators and the congressmen and all of that.
[02:02:04.121 --> 02:02:08.283]  And I found that when I mentioned, do you guys realize what's happening out in the real world?
[02:02:08.303 --> 02:02:16.246]  Do you understand that people out here, the average honest citizen is getting together and having meetings and forming militia units and arming themselves with teeth because they fear you.
[02:02:16.286 --> 02:02:17.106]  They fear the government.
[02:02:17.306 --> 02:02:19.447]  They looked at me with this blind look and said, what are you talking about?
[02:02:20.137 --> 02:02:21.377]  They didn't even have a clue.
[02:02:21.898 --> 02:02:29.440]  Well, you know, I think to this day, though, they're in their ivory towers, and they don't know that what was going on then, it's 50 times that, because most of it's underground.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:33.482]  Jack McClam, I want to get your take on this when we get back, then we'll start going to calls here.
[02:02:33.962 --> 02:02:39.004]  And I want to go over some news items with both of you gentlemen and get your analysis on those points as well.
[02:02:39.504 --> 02:02:40.024]  Stay with us.
[02:02:40.044 --> 02:02:40.924]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.964 --> 02:02:41.605]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:52.177]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.478 --> 02:02:53.859]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.039 --> 02:02:56.241]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.402 --> 02:02:58.484]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.764 --> 02:03:03.709]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.050 --> 02:03:08.074]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:10.094]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.174 --> 02:03:20.796]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and findable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.956 --> 02:03:22.857]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:03:44.561 --> 02:03:45.621]  Are you a diabetic?
[02:03:45.701 --> 02:03:48.302]  Do you have Medicare or private insurance?
[02:03:48.622 --> 02:03:52.582]  If you do, here's some great news that could save you time and money.
[02:03:52.762 --> 02:03:58.704]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, iCare may be able to provide your supplies at no cost to you.
[02:03:58.844 --> 02:03:59.644]  Here's why.
[02:04:00.024 --> 02:04:01.044]  We work with Medicare.

[02:04:44.461 --> 02:04:55.190]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:36.581]  Big Brother.
[02:05:36.621 --> 02:05:37.381]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:37.561 --> 02:05:38.562]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.762 --> 02:05:55.603]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.623 --> 02:05:58.244]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.264 --> 02:06:01.806]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:06.249]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.412 --> 02:06:10.872]  All right.
[02:06:11.092 --> 02:06:13.194]  Again, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:13.494 --> 02:06:15.455]  Roger and Steve and Ron and others.
[02:06:16.676 --> 02:06:21.799]  We're talking to Colonel Craig Roberts and, of course, Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[02:06:22.627 --> 02:06:25.803]  Jack, the points that the caller and Craig were just making...
[02:06:27.314 --> 02:06:32.879]  Again, in the decade I've been fighting the globalists, I have never seen people waking up so fast.
[02:06:32.939 --> 02:06:42.307]  I've never seen the public listening and believing and checking out what I'm saying on other people's talk shows, on talk shows where the talk show host attacks me.
[02:06:42.927 --> 02:06:46.350]  I mean, we're really seeing an awakening here.
[02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:47.731]  Are you getting that as well?
[02:06:47.992 --> 02:06:49.032]  We're getting it, yes.
[02:06:49.173 --> 02:06:54.277]  We deal with mostly military and law enforcement here, but that is very, very true.
[02:06:55.003 --> 02:07:06.531]  My email especially, even from out of the country from soldiers and of course police officers too, many serving in the Middle East right now and other places, are awakening.
[02:07:06.651 --> 02:07:15.217]  We have more and more soldiers taking a stand and saying they're not going to go back and fight this war for oil and war for Israel over there.
[02:07:16.438 --> 02:07:18.059]  It's happening almost daily now.
[02:07:19.238 --> 02:07:24.442]  In the law enforcement military area, we have letters coming in from police officers.
[02:07:24.502 --> 02:07:35.011]  I have two right here in front of me saying no to tyranny and saying no to allowing the feds to come into the county and use them to take property without due process.
[02:07:35.071 --> 02:07:41.296]  I mean, there's an awakening in law enforcement, the military, and in the private sector like we've never seen either.
[02:07:42.677 --> 02:07:45.379]  Well, what's going to happen, though, in the next year?
[02:07:45.459 --> 02:07:46.760]  What do you see happening, Craig?
[02:07:48.058 --> 02:07:52.301]  Well, I think it's going to be more of the same as far as what you're talking about, as far as people waking up.
[02:07:54.442 --> 02:08:02.147]  I'm running into people now when I do seminars and talk shows and so on that before, you know, two or three years ago, they had their head in the sand.
[02:08:02.167 --> 02:08:03.227]  They didn't want to hear it.
[02:08:03.367 --> 02:08:04.868]  You know, guys like me were nuts.
[02:08:04.908 --> 02:08:05.429]  We're crazy.
[02:08:05.469 --> 02:08:06.309]  This couldn't be happening.
[02:08:06.349 --> 02:08:07.050]  Not in this country.
[02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:07.970]  Maybe someplace else.
[02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:09.591]  And now they come back and say, gee, you were right.
[02:08:10.091 --> 02:08:13.433]  I had, you know, several years ago, back in 96, 95, 94, right in there,
[02:08:16.837 --> 02:08:25.742]  Well, after 1995, when I started really digging into Oklahoma City bombing and writing reports no one wanted to see, our own Special Investigation Division assigned an officer to watch me.
[02:08:26.742 --> 02:08:34.186]  And I was branded as a liability, a nutcase, a loose cannon, and so on and so forth.
[02:08:35.367 --> 02:08:42.090]  Two years ago, one of those guys that was in Special Investigations at the time came to me and said, you know what, they had a meeting last week.
[02:08:42.873 --> 02:08:47.335]  And they pulled out your old files and they said, you know, the only thing Roberts was was ahead of his time.
[02:08:47.856 --> 02:08:49.797]  He told us about stuff and we didn't believe it.
[02:08:49.837 --> 02:08:50.677]  Now it's all happening.
[02:08:51.197 --> 02:08:58.281]  So that was kind of a... I felt pretty good that some of those guys woke up because they were about the hardest cases to wake up you could run into.
[02:08:58.321 --> 02:09:02.163]  So if they're waking up, there's got to be patrol officers out here that are doing the same thing.
[02:09:02.183 --> 02:09:10.127]  Well, I want to ask Jack McClam about this because his organization, probably no one out there interfaces more with law enforcement, peace officers, and the military.
[02:09:11.011 --> 02:09:13.592]  You know, a lot of these guys and gals, they're not bad people.
[02:09:13.653 --> 02:09:14.533]  They're good people.
[02:09:14.593 --> 02:09:19.656]  So they've made psychological excuses for what they're doing, violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:09:20.376 --> 02:09:29.861]  And because they're good, they can't imagine that they're compartmentalized in a structure that's doing bad, and they can't imagine that superiors would be bad.
[02:09:29.881 --> 02:09:32.522]  Have you found that's part of the psychological problem?
[02:09:33.203 --> 02:09:34.183]  It certainly is.
[02:09:34.803 --> 02:09:35.824]  But I'll tell you what.
[02:09:36.621 --> 02:09:44.165]  More and more of these soldiers and police officers are seeing through it because they're actually getting involved in their own areas.
[02:09:44.805 --> 02:09:56.992]  We have, like I say, two letters here of police officers taking an active part of standing up and saying no to things they're being told to do, the orders and so forth.
[02:09:57.692 --> 02:10:02.735]  And we had Sergeant Kevin Venderman on twice yesterday on my two radio programs.
[02:10:03.175 --> 02:10:06.037]  You know about him saying no, he's not going to go back.
[02:10:06.741 --> 02:10:08.002]  To Iraq.
[02:10:08.162 --> 02:10:10.663]  And he was talking about the rifles don't even work.
[02:10:11.143 --> 02:10:19.488]  Yes, and of course he and his squad was told by their commander to shoot the children if they threw rocks at them, and they refused to do it.
[02:10:19.748 --> 02:10:29.533]  I heard him telling a story about there's a kid bringing them an RPG to show them where a cache is, and normally the child would be killed, but he was just showing them where the cache was, a 10-year-old.
[02:10:29.833 --> 02:10:35.676]  Yes, and he was basically felt that he should shoot this kid
[02:10:36.397 --> 02:10:42.661]  But he hesitated long enough for the kid to show him that he was just showing him the weapon and showed him where a cache of weapons were.
[02:10:42.681 --> 02:10:59.971]  So there's more of these soldiers we're hearing from all the time now and law enforcement too that are seeing through this and I think it's because of all the information going out there like on your show, Alex, and all the publications and they're beginning to think twice now.
[02:11:00.031 --> 02:11:03.213]  Maybe some of this could be true that we're hearing about.
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:06.863]  And so we're finding that, that they're beginning to ask questions.
[02:11:06.883 --> 02:11:08.665]  Well, this is what I wanted to bring it down to.
[02:11:09.306 --> 02:11:25.222]  Six months from now, a year and a half from now, we wake up, a major city's been hit by a suitcase nuke, smallpox has been released, they're declaring a lockdown for your safety, they're telling us our freedoms are out the window for now, but of course the border will stay wide open.
[02:11:25.502 --> 02:11:25.662]  Yes.
[02:11:26.730 --> 02:11:29.451]  Do you gentlemen, both of you, see this happening, A?
[02:11:29.972 --> 02:11:34.674]  And B, how do you see it playing out?
[02:11:35.395 --> 02:11:42.558]  Well, I think, and I've been predicting this for a long time, I am totally surprised that they haven't launched a nuke someplace already, some suitcase nuke someplace.
[02:11:42.578 --> 02:11:46.520]  And Alex, there's two things going on right now that you need to be made aware of.
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:46.660]  One is...
[02:11:49.703 --> 02:11:52.625]  They've been briefing on what ifs on the suitcase nukes.
[02:11:53.346 --> 02:11:59.851]  What if they did one Monday, another one Tuesday, another one Wednesday, and on Thursday said, you surrender or else we keep doing this.
[02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:01.612]  Well, number one, all the cities are going to panic.
[02:12:02.034 --> 02:12:03.516]  People are going to flood the countryside.
[02:12:03.576 --> 02:12:05.218]  No one's going to want to stay inside of the city.
[02:12:05.258 --> 02:12:06.339]  The whole country's going to collapse.
[02:12:06.359 --> 02:12:07.701]  It's going to bring everything to a standstill.
[02:12:07.721 --> 02:12:16.050]  If you throw some anthrax or plague or something virus on top of that or smallpox, then what you've got is a giant population reduction program underway.
[02:12:16.231 --> 02:12:17.632]  Total bedlam.
[02:12:18.013 --> 02:12:19.254]  But there's another thing that's been going on.
[02:12:19.274 --> 02:12:20.376]  We've been getting reports.
[02:12:21.016 --> 02:12:22.317]  Through my federal contacts.
[02:12:22.597 --> 02:12:25.198]  They call me all the time and ask me what I think about something.
[02:12:25.238 --> 02:12:36.964]  And the first one came out of Honolulu, and a friend of mine with the government, he said, hey, we had an airplane takeoff here yesterday, and it was at nighttime, and he got lased with a pulsating green laser.
[02:12:37.004 --> 02:12:37.785]  What could that mean?
[02:12:38.165 --> 02:12:40.086]  And I said, that's range finding.
[02:12:40.146 --> 02:12:43.568]  Somebody's establishing a firing position for a shoulder-launched missile.
[02:12:43.588 --> 02:12:45.689]  They want to know if the airplane's in the firing envelope.
[02:12:45.729 --> 02:12:47.550]  But instead they're out grabbing...
[02:12:49.131 --> 02:12:52.933]  You know, little grocery store clerks are playing with toy lasers.
[02:12:52.954 --> 02:12:57.657]  Well, the pulsating green laser that goes to 8,000 feet isn't a toy.
[02:12:57.857 --> 02:12:58.598]  No, I understand.
[02:12:58.638 --> 02:13:00.419]  I'm saying instead they're out grabbing people with toys.
[02:13:00.439 --> 02:13:00.940]  Right, right.
[02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:03.642]  You're making my point.
[02:13:04.402 --> 02:13:13.009]  Last night they did a show on our local news right here about there's been like 15 of these incidents that have been reported in the last 90 days.
[02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:16.892]  Well, they never were reported before, and these people don't all know each other, so who are they?
[02:13:17.293 --> 02:13:17.473]  Well...
[02:13:19.547 --> 02:13:20.008]  They came on.
[02:13:20.048 --> 02:13:21.148]  They said, there's nothing to it.
[02:13:21.268 --> 02:13:22.229]  We've investigated.
[02:13:22.329 --> 02:13:22.909]  We've checked out.
[02:13:22.969 --> 02:13:26.410]  So you think they're busting innocent people to cover up the real threat?
[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.031]  They haven't investigated anything.
[02:13:28.091 --> 02:13:30.352]  They know that something's going to happen.
[02:13:30.412 --> 02:13:35.554]  I'm telling you right now, the first time that we lose a civilian airliner coming out of some inland state...
[02:13:36.647 --> 02:13:39.588]  To a shoulder launch, Sam, and then another one in another city.
[02:13:40.228 --> 02:13:43.629]  The air industry is dead in this country for all intents and purposes.
[02:13:44.169 --> 02:13:47.650]  And once that's dead, also the air cargo industry.
[02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:59.073]  And once the air cargo industry is dead, and FedEx and UPS and all this stuff doesn't fly anymore, and the post office doesn't fly anymore, you're shutting down the entire country just with one business, and that's aviation.
[02:14:00.574 --> 02:14:01.714]  Jack McClam, comments?
[02:14:02.918 --> 02:14:06.720]  Yes, it's got to come, Alex.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:16.444]  It's got to come because, you see, everything that the Bush crime family and these internationalists have to get done has to get done through sheer terror.
[02:14:17.105 --> 02:14:27.750]  And we know that we keep getting military people talking to us about their hearing from their sources that the draft is coming maybe June, maybe even before that.
[02:14:28.670 --> 02:14:30.631]  And to sell the American people on
[02:14:31.557 --> 02:14:40.481]  These type of things, and also to stop Alex Jones and all these people broadcasting and sending out publications that are waking so many.
[02:14:41.121 --> 02:14:43.942]  It's a geometric progression today that they've got to stop.
[02:14:43.982 --> 02:14:47.303]  They've got to have more terrorism, and it's got to be bad.
[02:14:47.383 --> 02:15:00.929]  It's got to be so bad that when they suspend the Constitution and the First Amendment, surely to stop all of us, and to sell the draft that the American people will say, well, the government's here to help us, and we've got to go along with it.
[02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:26.272]  We also feel that there will be a push if they can kill 100,000 to a half a million Americans or more in this next one, there will probably, we've had some very good sources say that they will try to say that, listen, all the terrorists out there have weapons, they have guns, so we're asking the good citizens to turn in their weapons so that we will know who the bad citizens are, who the bad guys are.
[02:15:26.753 --> 02:15:28.134]  So there's going to be a lot of push.
[02:15:28.234 --> 02:15:29.575]  This year we believe
[02:15:30.171 --> 02:15:31.733]  Oh boy, let's take a call.
[02:15:31.753 --> 02:15:32.794]  Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:15:32.814 --> 02:15:33.455]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:15:50.313 --> 02:15:51.174]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:15:51.194 --> 02:15:56.760]  Kind of unrelated to the current topic, just the previous ones, unless you want to, say, put me in the back of the bus for later or take another call.
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:57.881]  Go ahead.
[02:15:57.901 --> 02:16:02.926]  Yeah, I was just... The notion that poverty breeds revolver violence is really a fallacy.
[02:16:02.946 --> 02:16:07.971]  It has been generated internally only in the most rare, exceptional circumstance, only...
[02:16:08.763 --> 02:16:12.687]  If only because the impoverished are always too weak to rebel without being squashed.
[02:16:13.287 --> 02:16:20.154]  So the real truth is that the so-called successful revolts are almost always engineered, as you've pointed out, from the top down.
[02:16:20.174 --> 02:16:31.785]  I was kind of having too much fun with John, I think, the almost honest communist, when he kept jumping past the installation era of Fidel Castro.
[02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:37.574]  When I tried to pin him down on who installed Castro, he kept jumping to the ostensible remover.
[02:16:37.614 --> 02:16:38.175]  Well, you know what?
[02:16:38.195 --> 02:16:39.036]  I want to talk about that.
[02:16:39.516 --> 02:16:41.058]  This whole fake left-right paradigm.
[02:16:41.959 --> 02:16:52.169]  Roberts, McClan, for people who don't get this, can you, in a nutshell, and then after the break, explain the false dialectic and how the globalists control fascism and communism?
[02:16:53.516 --> 02:16:55.197]  Craig, why don't you take that right now and quickly?
[02:16:55.617 --> 02:16:58.559]  Well, yeah, you've got the same ballplayers.
[02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:09.006]  It goes all the way back to the original Bauer plan, which was control both sides of a conflict, and it doesn't matter who wins or loses because they both end up in your debt and you end up in charge.
[02:17:10.528 --> 02:17:11.528]  It's the same deal.
[02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:15.431]  The only difference between fascism...
[02:17:16.318 --> 02:17:21.301]  And communism is that there are only a few degrees of separation at the opposite end of the circle.
[02:17:21.641 --> 02:17:25.423]  When you get all the way around there, they're both basically doing the same thing for their own agenda.
[02:17:27.064 --> 02:17:36.170]  It's all command and control or neo-feudalism, serfdom, slavery, tyranny, despotism, domination of the human spirit.
[02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:43.074]  All right, we'll come back and we'll take more calls from Steve and Ron and others with our two great guests.
[02:17:47.282 --> 02:17:49.344]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[02:17:50.085 --> 02:17:53.569]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:17:54.170 --> 02:17:57.714]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:17:58.375 --> 02:18:00.978]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:03.821]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:05.704]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:18:06.434 --> 02:18:08.156]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[02:18:08.717 --> 02:18:09.678]  Check with your doctor.
[02:18:09.778 --> 02:18:14.683]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, seasonal affective disorder.
[02:18:15.143 --> 02:18:19.868]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[02:18:20.529 --> 02:18:21.370]  Light up your life.
[02:18:21.470 --> 02:18:24.193]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the Northern Light.
[02:18:24.733 --> 02:18:26.415]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066.
[02:18:29.685 --> 02:18:34.968]  And speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[02:18:35.468 --> 02:18:37.629]  That's NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[02:18:38.169 --> 02:18:39.650]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[02:18:39.710 --> 02:18:42.051]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:18:42.091 --> 02:18:47.454]  The real money folks.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.203]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:57.243 --> 02:18:59.225]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:18:59.826 --> 02:19:05.451]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:15.143 --> 02:19:20.765]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:21.385 --> 02:19:24.406]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:19:24.966 --> 02:19:30.108]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.408 --> 02:19:35.329]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:38.951]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[02:19:39.411 --> 02:19:40.811]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:48.011]  The war on terrorism.
[02:19:48.331 --> 02:19:51.115]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.396 --> 02:19:55.542]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:55.982 --> 02:19:56.803]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.124 --> 02:20:01.691]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.171 --> 02:20:04.292]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:04.793 --> 02:20:19.482]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:19.522 --> 02:20:26.586]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:26.846 --> 02:20:27.167]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:27.207 --> 02:20:28.909]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:20:47.299 --> 02:20:52.784]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:53.204 --> 02:20:57.428]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:57.669 --> 02:21:04.715]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:05.095 --> 02:21:11.201]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:11.341 --> 02:21:12.562]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:12.742 --> 02:21:13.203]  We're good to go.
[02:21:29.662 --> 02:21:32.804]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:21:32.824 --> 02:21:32.864]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.884 --> 02:21:32.924]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.944 --> 02:21:34.104]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:34.124 --> 02:21:34.324]  Call today.
[02:21:48.425 --> 02:21:48.865]  Don't worry.
[02:21:49.386 --> 02:21:50.946]  This show is documented.
[02:21:51.427 --> 02:21:54.148]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.608 --> 02:22:06.154]  I just got an interesting call from Ellen Mariani, one of the widows at 9-11, about her lawsuit against the government for involvement.
[02:22:07.215 --> 02:22:09.396]  And she just called in during the break.
[02:22:09.416 --> 02:22:10.797]  We're going to have her on tomorrow.
[02:22:10.857 --> 02:22:11.077]  Wow.
[02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:16.084]  So much incredible stuff going on that you'll be hearing about tomorrow.
[02:22:16.985 --> 02:22:27.028]  I want to go back to your calls here, but Jack, before the break, we were talking about the false left-right paradigm and how this confuses people.
[02:22:27.068 --> 02:22:27.928]  Can you speak to that?
[02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.929]  Oh, yes.
[02:22:29.709 --> 02:22:33.310]  Our Law Enforcement Military Association have been finding that.
[02:22:34.090 --> 02:22:38.492]  This has been 60 years of it that we've tracked here in the United States.
[02:22:39.051 --> 02:22:48.199]  Almost every institution is controlled by the Hegelian dialectic, and especially through this new consensus process.
[02:22:48.239 --> 02:23:00.310]  Well, it's not new, but that is a part of the Hegelian dialectic where they create problems and then they come up with solutions that people wouldn't have accepted had they not created the problem to begin with.
[02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:03.953]  So our whole nation is controlled by this process.
[02:23:04.437 --> 02:23:10.140]  The Republican Socialist Party and Democratic Socialist Party, there's no difference, but you're supposed to think there is.
[02:23:10.821 --> 02:23:16.564]  And so, yeah, it's completely throughout our whole system today.
[02:23:17.364 --> 02:23:24.368]  Well, a lot of these so-called conservatives don't want to hear about Bush appointing all these pro-abortion people, anti-gun people, MEChA members.
[02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:30.412]  And they'll call me a liberal for being against what Bush is doing.
[02:23:30.452 --> 02:23:31.393]  Bush is just a puppet.
[02:23:31.413 --> 02:23:31.953]  Craig Roberts?
[02:23:32.873 --> 02:23:35.536]  Well, you know, he's part of the same group as the rest of them.
[02:23:35.576 --> 02:23:41.062]  He was a skull and bones guy, just like Kerry and a lot of the others, and Skrull and Key and all of that bunch.
[02:23:41.302 --> 02:23:48.730]  It all goes back through the CFR to the Royal Society for International Affairs, the globalist roundtable group in London, whose simple deal is very simple.
[02:23:48.970 --> 02:23:50.492]  It's a one world government.
[02:23:50.852 --> 02:23:51.513]  We're in charge.
[02:23:51.653 --> 02:23:52.133]  You're not.
[02:23:52.554 --> 02:23:54.436]  We take the third world countries.
[02:23:55.262 --> 02:23:59.525]  And by redistribution of the wealth from the first world countries, bring them up to second world status.
[02:23:59.565 --> 02:24:01.506]  Most people haven't even heard of second world status.
[02:24:01.527 --> 02:24:06.690]  We take the first world countries and we reduce them through treaties, through trade agreements, NAFTA, GATT.
[02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:07.831]  We reduce the borders.
[02:24:07.871 --> 02:24:09.592]  We allow free immigration across the borders.
[02:24:09.632 --> 02:24:13.375]  We redistribute their companies and corporations overseas.
[02:24:13.395 --> 02:24:15.396]  We bring them down to second world status.
[02:24:15.416 --> 02:24:16.117]  Now, at that time,
[02:24:16.537 --> 02:24:23.262]  When all of those countries are on the same ball of wax, they're totally disarmed, they're all in line, the population's been reduced, we have the New World Order.
[02:24:23.502 --> 02:24:24.263]  We're in charge.
[02:24:24.503 --> 02:24:25.464]  They're the worker bees.
[02:24:25.524 --> 02:24:26.705]  We're the elite.
[02:24:26.765 --> 02:24:27.345]  We profit.
[02:24:27.685 --> 02:24:28.906]  That's the whole thing in a nutshell.
[02:24:29.107 --> 02:24:31.608]  The problem is, this bunch works for Satan.
[02:24:32.189 --> 02:24:32.909]  It's as simple as that.
[02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:34.350]  Let's take a call.
[02:24:35.231 --> 02:24:38.213]  Up next here is Steve in Nevada, then Ron and others.
[02:24:38.253 --> 02:24:38.914]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:24:39.374 --> 02:24:39.875]  Hey, thank you.
[02:24:39.915 --> 02:24:40.315]  Can you hear me?
[02:24:40.495 --> 02:24:40.735]  Yes.
[02:24:41.075 --> 02:24:41.436]  Okay.
[02:24:41.796 --> 02:24:43.717]  My question was for Colonel Robert.
[02:24:43.837 --> 02:24:45.719]  He was getting into something concerning...
[02:24:46.665 --> 02:24:48.608]  Who profits from these Humvees?
[02:24:48.669 --> 02:24:53.657]  He had mentioned the Colt manufacturer being McNamara Bell Helicopter being Lady Bird Johnson.
[02:24:53.677 --> 02:24:55.039]  He was just getting into Humvees.
[02:24:55.792 --> 02:24:57.854]  Would you finish that thought Colonel Robert?
[02:24:58.635 --> 02:25:09.904]  Where I was going with that is somebody needs to investigate to find out where the money is going on the manufacturing of Humvees and where the money is going on all the modifications, all the improvements and all the armor.
[02:25:10.424 --> 02:25:15.188]  Because what we found out a lot of times when this happens it doesn't have anything to do with product improvement.
[02:25:15.208 --> 02:25:17.130]  It doesn't have anything to do with troop safety or need.
[02:25:17.170 --> 02:25:20.032]  It has to do with who makes the money off the contracts.
[02:25:20.092 --> 02:25:21.753]  And I think that's where we need to look at.
[02:25:21.813 --> 02:25:23.215]  I haven't had time to do it myself yet.
[02:25:24.794 --> 02:25:29.702]  I've been too busy fighting to get the M113 pulled out of mothballs and sent over there.
[02:25:29.742 --> 02:25:30.363]  They're already bought.
[02:25:30.383 --> 02:25:31.244]  They're already paid for.
[02:25:31.304 --> 02:25:37.334]  We have the ability to move them, and they're ten times better on protecting our troops than these wheeled vehicles that they're using.
[02:25:37.354 --> 02:25:38.796]  You see, they're even better than the Stryker.
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:42.801]  We proved to Vietnam that they would withstand a whole lot.
[02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:45.982]  Mines, bombs, and all kinds of stuff to a certain extent.
[02:25:46.743 --> 02:25:56.506]  Nothing's going to be perfect, but two inches of aluminum armor is better than canvas, and it's better than a quarter inch of steel, so we've got the stuff.
[02:25:56.546 --> 02:25:57.206]  Why aren't we using it?
[02:25:57.246 --> 02:25:58.347]  We never could get an answer.
[02:25:58.407 --> 02:26:04.969]  Now I see last week that finally they've decided to start sending some of them over there, and I think it's because of all the pressure we've put on.
[02:26:05.929 --> 02:26:08.170]  Okay, now my last comment is...
[02:26:09.162 --> 02:26:14.644]  Whatever happened to and where is, and I'm sure you're aware of this, gentlemen, whatever happened to and where is Colonel Bo Gray?
[02:26:15.725 --> 02:26:24.069]  Well, you know, I think that Jack is the one to answer that the best because I haven't kept up with Bo lately, and I think Jack probably has his finger on that.
[02:26:24.109 --> 02:26:24.369]  Jack?
[02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:27.150]  Yeah, I talked to him about three days ago.
[02:26:27.250 --> 02:26:28.290]  He's doing fine.
[02:26:28.310 --> 02:26:36.714]  He is having some health problems, which he's going to the VA hospital, and he told me the other day they're doing a good job on him.
[02:26:37.193 --> 02:26:39.634]  He's trying to help him with some of his health problems.
[02:26:39.654 --> 02:26:43.455]  They're even fixing all of his bad teeth.
[02:26:43.875 --> 02:26:44.755]  He's doing fine.
[02:26:44.815 --> 02:26:46.076]  He's written a new book.
[02:26:46.096 --> 02:26:49.357]  He has out his new book called My Brother's Keeper.
[02:26:49.417 --> 02:26:51.417]  He's doing radio now once again.
[02:26:51.717 --> 02:26:54.698]  He's getting back into it and I'm happy to see that.
[02:26:55.198 --> 02:26:56.859]  Perhaps you can answer just my last question.
[02:26:58.059 --> 02:27:03.981]  I met Bo back when he was running for president back in Colorado at some obscure Holiday Inn somewhere.
[02:27:04.525 --> 02:27:12.353]  Now, my point is, I asked him, I said, you know, at the time, both he and Ross Perot were running simultaneously for the same election.
[02:27:12.453 --> 02:27:20.801]  I said, you know, I think it would be like just a godsend if you two great men could get together and run.
[02:27:21.342 --> 02:27:24.185]  And he shocked me when he said he did not like...
[02:27:25.212 --> 02:27:28.877]  Ross Perot, and I didn't get into it because... All right, I get your point.
[02:27:28.917 --> 02:27:31.921]  We're going to come back, take a few more calls, get into some other news issues.
[02:27:32.342 --> 02:27:34.705]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:27:35.827 --> 02:27:36.728]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.189 --> 02:27:38.811]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.712 --> 02:27:42.416]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:08.188 --> 02:29:19.237]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.357 --> 02:29:28.225]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.505 --> 02:29:31.787]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:29:45.232 --> 02:29:48.933]  You've heard about pods from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[02:29:49.213 --> 02:29:53.494]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[02:29:53.734 --> 02:30:00.676]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:30:01.036 --> 02:30:01.577]  We're good to go.

[02:30:38.281 --> 02:30:42.923]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the BioOx family of products.
[02:30:46.927 --> 02:30:52.112]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.753 --> 02:30:55.095]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:55.115 --> 02:31:02.201]  All right, Jack's going to be leaving us here in about 15 minutes.
[02:31:02.261 --> 02:31:08.367]  He's got to get out his newsletter on this month's great issue, and we're going to have Craig with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:31:08.387 --> 02:31:11.489]  I'm going to take just three more calls from Ron and...
[02:31:12.813 --> 02:31:20.839]  Okay, the easiest thing to do, I understand, I haven't done it, but if you just put Officer Jack McLam in a search engine and push the button, you'll come up with our website, which is policeandmilitary.com.
[02:31:43.095 --> 02:31:48.977]  againstthenewworldborder.com or .org, but you have to put a hyphen between each word.
[02:31:49.037 --> 02:31:54.460]  It's better just to put Jack McLam, Officer Jack McLam, push the search engine, and you'll get to our website.
[02:31:55.200 --> 02:32:05.284]  If people would like to get copies of our police and military publication, Alex, on constitutional issues, just write to us here at HC11.
[02:32:06.004 --> 02:32:12.087]  That's like Hotel Charlie 11, Box 357, like the good old Magnum I carried on duty.
[02:32:12.867 --> 02:32:33.857]  KAMIAH Idaho 83536 HC11 Box 357 KAMIAH Idaho 83536 If you don't mind, send us a $3 donation because, boy, that postage is expensive.
[02:32:34.397 --> 02:32:39.780]  We're an all-volunteer police and military association, but as Alex knows, we sure need the money to pay the bill.
[02:32:40.533 --> 02:32:41.154]  Absolutely.
[02:32:41.194 --> 02:32:47.300]  Now, I want to just throw news articles out at both of you before we take a few final calls, and I want to get your quick response or take on it.
[02:32:47.580 --> 02:32:49.062]  We talked about this in the last hour.
[02:32:50.042 --> 02:32:53.806]  The American Free Press, OKC bombshell implicates feds in Murroblast.
[02:32:54.166 --> 02:32:56.909]  We knew they were doing tests of blowing up trucks and cars.
[02:32:57.470 --> 02:33:03.676]  The very BATF officer that was over this for the National Security Council, for Bill Clinton personally,
[02:33:04.932 --> 02:33:13.120]  Harry Everhart was there on the ground outside the building when the bomb went off, and he's the one that called it in saying it was an ANFO bomb.
[02:33:13.561 --> 02:33:15.563]  That's pretty obvious, is it not, Jack?
[02:33:15.823 --> 02:33:16.964]  That sure is, brother.
[02:33:17.344 --> 02:33:20.748]  I'll tell you, that thing stinks all the way through, as Greg can tell you.
[02:33:20.808 --> 02:33:24.131]  I mean, there's nothing that works for that situation.
[02:33:25.112 --> 02:33:26.674]  Alex, back years ago...
[02:33:27.304 --> 02:33:35.468]  We were the ones, our police team, that went to Arkansas from nine different states to reinvestigate the execution of Sheriff Dean Matthews and Gordon Call.
[02:33:36.169 --> 02:33:45.014]  We were able to find out the truth of who killed who, how Gordon Call and the sheriff were executed, because they left the crime scene there.
[02:33:45.594 --> 02:33:55.940]  And so ever since then, they've always removed the crime scenes within days after they do one of their things, like Oklahoma City and the Waco Holocaust down there.
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:56.620]  They always go in.
[02:33:57.188 --> 02:33:58.548]  Remove the crime scene.
[02:33:58.949 --> 02:33:59.589]  Or 9-11.
[02:33:59.709 --> 02:34:04.250]  Yeah, 9-11, and so nobody can go in and find out who the true bad guys are.
[02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:05.971]  Let me get a comment from Craig on that.
[02:34:05.991 --> 02:34:09.072]  Hello?
[02:34:09.452 --> 02:34:11.812]  Yes, Craig, they like to get rid of the evidence, don't they?
[02:34:11.832 --> 02:34:15.574]  Yeah, and we ran into that, of course, with the Murrah Building and TW800.
[02:34:15.634 --> 02:34:17.214]  If you look at the TW800 stuff,
[02:34:21.307 --> 02:34:27.433]  When they moved all the evidence into the Calverton hangar, you never saw the engines.
[02:34:27.493 --> 02:34:28.654]  The engines disappeared.
[02:34:28.694 --> 02:34:30.195]  They never even arrived in the hangar.
[02:34:30.215 --> 02:34:35.480]  When they were pulled out of the water, they were taken someplace else because one of them had taken a missile hit right in the side of it and was burned up.
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:37.462]  I had videotaped that at one time.
[02:34:38.194 --> 02:34:38.855]  We're good to go.
[02:34:57.376 --> 02:34:58.637]  Because you'd be able to detect that.
[02:34:58.657 --> 02:35:00.398]  But how are we ever going to know if we can't get there?
[02:35:00.638 --> 02:35:03.419]  All right, here's a whole other area I want to shift gears into.
[02:35:03.899 --> 02:35:08.021]  All over the country, they're putting in camera systems that scan your license plates instantly.
[02:35:08.321 --> 02:35:12.283]  The police car just drives around scanning all the plates automatically.
[02:35:12.483 --> 02:35:13.344]  They go, oh, it'll stop.
[02:35:13.684 --> 02:35:16.365]  You know, all these different criminals and car thieves.
[02:35:16.385 --> 02:35:20.727]  The problem is that in the future you haven't paid your taxes, whatever.
[02:35:21.708 --> 02:35:23.048]  It's all part of this database.
[02:35:23.128 --> 02:35:32.192]  Ergonomics today, they want to make a law where all cars have an infrared camera videotaping you via a cell phone back to the police department.
[02:35:32.832 --> 02:35:35.934]  They're saying that they're going to have toll roads on all the major streets.
[02:35:36.454 --> 02:35:37.555]  All of this is happening.
[02:35:37.575 --> 02:35:42.177]  They passed the national ID card a month ago going into the state driver's license.
[02:35:42.217 --> 02:35:43.097]  Comments from both of you?
[02:35:44.591 --> 02:35:45.031]  Go ahead, Jack.
[02:35:45.151 --> 02:35:47.093]  Well, hit martial law coming.
[02:35:47.453 --> 02:35:47.934]  That's it.
[02:35:48.014 --> 02:36:02.805]  They want us to beg, as a matter of fact, demand martial law, and the only way they can do that is to have more terrible terrorism across this nation, and the people will demand martial law, and they're getting all set up for it, obviously.
[02:36:02.865 --> 02:36:06.568]  Well, this control grid makes 1984 look like child's play.
[02:36:06.588 --> 02:36:07.248]  Comments, Greg?
[02:36:07.869 --> 02:36:13.193]  Well, yeah, and when I saw a map that they had done,
[02:36:13.877 --> 02:36:17.883]  That broke the United States down into every single county on one map.
[02:36:18.850 --> 02:36:28.193]  And said, we can go in to each of these little tiny squares, these little counties, and we can further break these down into 10-meter grid squares.
[02:36:28.273 --> 02:36:38.597]  Not 100-meter, but 10-meter grid squares for searches or for identification or for locating anything, and then we can home in on that by satellite or other means.
[02:36:39.637 --> 02:36:43.238]  That was pretty frightening that they were even thinking about doing something like that, because who would care?
[02:36:43.298 --> 02:36:45.679]  Who would care about 10 feet in your backyard?
[02:36:46.603 --> 02:36:56.606]  And have it on a map and have it programmed into computers so that they could go there within seconds with some type of imaging device or whatever.
[02:36:57.727 --> 02:37:15.372]  That's pretty frightening when they want that amount of control over every piece of real estate at every... And it just came out, what we knew years ago, they're going to have yearly census and they're going to try to make you answer all these questions when you have a Fifth Amendment and they're going to take all these integrated databases and put them into the Census Department.
[02:37:17.219 --> 02:37:17.679]  Absolutely.
[02:37:18.019 --> 02:37:19.900]  It's control.
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:22.081]  And you know what all this control is generated from?
[02:37:22.121 --> 02:37:22.602]  It's fear.
[02:37:23.182 --> 02:37:25.163]  It's the fear of the people in charge.
[02:37:25.523 --> 02:37:26.904]  They fear everybody.
[02:37:26.984 --> 02:37:28.984]  You fear the peasants when you're sitting in the castle.
[02:37:29.365 --> 02:37:32.706]  You think that the peasants are going to get their torches and their pitchforks and storm the castle.
[02:37:32.726 --> 02:37:33.907]  So what you have to do, you disarm them.
[02:37:33.927 --> 02:37:35.127]  And why do you have so much fear?
[02:37:35.167 --> 02:37:38.709]  Because you know you're doing things that are wrong, and you've got even worse things planned.
[02:37:38.729 --> 02:37:40.690]  You know, we've put up with all of this peacefully.
[02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:45.112]  What is it they have that is planned that's so horrible that they know they're going to get resistance?
[02:37:45.672 --> 02:37:46.373]  Well, it's obvious.
[02:37:46.413 --> 02:37:49.195]  Their little New World Order isn't going to be swallowed like honey.
[02:37:49.795 --> 02:37:51.196]  And there's going to be resistance to it.
[02:37:51.216 --> 02:37:54.539]  They've already designated, they've already come up with a term called the resistors.
[02:37:54.599 --> 02:37:56.540]  You'll be one, I'll be one, Jack will be one.
[02:37:57.321 --> 02:37:58.462]  Which doesn't bother me a bit.
[02:37:58.502 --> 02:38:02.605]  I've always been a resistor, but they have plans for guys like us.
[02:38:02.965 --> 02:38:08.049]  What about Mr. Chertoff to be our new Homeland Security leader?
[02:38:08.109 --> 02:38:09.710]  And Mr. Gonzalez?
[02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.711]  Jack?
[02:38:10.931 --> 02:38:12.432]  I think he fits in perfect.
[02:38:12.532 --> 02:38:13.633]  When you understand who the...
[02:38:14.096 --> 02:38:19.659]  Who the crime families are that control this nation, they're perfect for a totalitarian system.
[02:38:20.699 --> 02:38:34.766]  I just had an interview with the leader of the Patriot Freedom Movement in New Zealand just a few days ago, Leo Hellyer, and he's talking about something we need to talk more about in America here, Alex, and that is water control.
[02:38:35.461 --> 02:38:39.585]  Down there, they are GPSing their wells.
[02:38:39.685 --> 02:38:42.127]  They've now started locking down their wells.
[02:38:42.667 --> 02:38:45.250]  Same thing's going on in England, Canada, and now here.
[02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:48.633]  That's right, and they've just come up here trying to GPS our wells.
[02:38:49.213 --> 02:38:56.860]  In our Christian constitutional communities, we ran them off, and the sheriff's backing us and saying, you can't come on their properties unless you're invited.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:02.625]  But he said that they're now metering the wells down there, and they've actually locked down some of the wells, and
[02:39:03.044 --> 02:39:11.270]  Of course what happens in Australia and New Zealand, the same thing begins to happen here and it's starting right now in America doing these same things.
[02:39:12.591 --> 02:39:14.493]  Well they're also metering wells all over Colorado.
[02:39:15.983 --> 02:39:23.509]  I just got back from there and there's people up in the mountains in Colorado that are saying if they come up here we're going to shoot them.
[02:39:23.669 --> 02:39:27.012]  They're really pushing the edge of the envelope with some of these people out in this part of the country.
[02:39:27.032 --> 02:39:34.899]  It may go over well in some areas back east or out in California but you get out in the Midwest and run into some of the backwoods areas like the one I live in and there's going to be problems.
[02:39:35.099 --> 02:39:36.400]  There's problems up here.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:42.806]  I'll tell you what, the guys aren't coming on our property now but one thing we have to remember years and years ago
[02:39:43.516 --> 02:39:50.100]  The Soviet boar spy named Henry Kissinger said to control nations, you control oil.
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:51.981]  To control people, you control food.
[02:39:52.441 --> 02:39:57.644]  Well, what better way to control the people that control the water that grows the food and keeps people alive?
[02:39:58.465 --> 02:39:59.805]  Well, water is your first commodity.
[02:39:59.905 --> 02:40:01.807]  If you control the water, you control the country.
[02:40:01.847 --> 02:40:03.147]  Everything else is irrelevant.
[02:40:03.287 --> 02:40:07.750]  Well, the UN put out a report five years ago saying they're going to create artificial scarcity in water.
[02:40:08.516 --> 02:40:09.076]  They're doing it.
[02:40:09.997 --> 02:40:10.517]  They're doing it.
[02:40:10.557 --> 02:40:12.198]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[02:40:12.318 --> 02:40:13.778]  Ron in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:40:13.818 --> 02:40:14.499]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:15.879 --> 02:40:19.501]  Yeah, guys, I'd like to hit several points real quick and let you respond when I get off.
[02:40:20.861 --> 02:40:33.907]  First off, the Daily Oklahoman reported after the bombing that an ATF agent and a DEA agent claimed to be trapped in an elevator at the Murrboro bombing.
[02:40:35.204 --> 02:40:40.287]  Apparently, the government offered anyone there in the building at the time, any government employee, early retirement.
[02:40:40.347 --> 02:40:47.551]  The DEA guy asked for early retirement, yet Fire Rescue said when they got to that particular elevator, there was no one in it.
[02:40:48.251 --> 02:40:55.535]  Also, how much vested interest does the County Sheriff and the OCPD have in keeping quiet on this?
[02:40:55.615 --> 02:40:56.556]  Any foreknowledge?
[02:40:56.896 --> 02:41:00.918]  Also, the Russians used Moslem troops from the provinces.
[02:41:01.516 --> 02:41:04.977]  For craft control in Russia because the Russians wouldn't shoot on Russians.
[02:41:05.538 --> 02:41:08.359]  And finally, a female U.S.
[02:41:08.419 --> 02:41:14.181]  Army officer has recently been brought up on charges for letting the U.S.
[02:41:14.221 --> 02:41:17.722]  Army troops salvage Humvee parts from a salvage yard in Kuwait.
[02:41:17.862 --> 02:41:22.064]  Is that because of the DU or because of the money involved?
[02:41:24.056 --> 02:41:24.496]  Me first?
[02:41:26.077 --> 02:41:27.037]  We could do a whole show here.
[02:41:27.057 --> 02:41:30.078]  In fact, three or four of them.
[02:41:30.618 --> 02:41:33.719]  There was nobody in that elevator, and those guys lied about it.
[02:41:34.379 --> 02:41:37.880]  The elevator company went and inspected, and that elevator did not free fall.
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:41.761]  They didn't get hurt in it, and they went up to Dr. Chumley afterwards and said, we want you to...
[02:41:43.582 --> 02:41:48.707]  You know, write a medical report and bandage me up and say that I was hurt in an elevator when that didn't happen.
[02:41:49.007 --> 02:41:49.968]  And he refused to do it.
[02:41:49.988 --> 02:41:53.031]  He later got killed in a plane crash, a very mysterious one, by the way.
[02:41:53.111 --> 02:41:56.014]  And a cop of the year who wouldn't go along with all these stories.
[02:41:56.034 --> 02:41:57.675]  He was tortured to death.
[02:41:57.755 --> 02:41:59.557]  Terrence Yakey, same type of deal.
[02:42:01.456 --> 02:42:04.218]  So, you know, that's the Oklahoma City deal.
[02:42:04.258 --> 02:42:05.099]  That didn't happen.
[02:42:05.339 --> 02:42:06.599]  Who was killed in the plane crash?
[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:07.780]  That was Dr. Chumley.
[02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:15.565]  Ah, not the DEA guy who later became, I mean, the DEA guy who did retire or the ATF guy who later became the head of ATF here.
[02:42:15.665 --> 02:42:23.810]  They're still out running around, and they backed down when they were faced by the elevator company in court and said that, no, this didn't happen, and all of a sudden that whole line just went away.
[02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.450]  Okay.
[02:42:25.911 --> 02:42:30.374]  Because they were getting problems because they were all out of the building and had told police who were told not to come in.
[02:42:31.578 --> 02:42:33.580]  So thank you for the call.
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:52.155]  I want to get some final comments here from Jack McClam, but bringing up another issue, there was a military officer down in Louisiana unloading coffins with flags on them, and the family wanted everybody to see the sacrifice, and the military officer, I've got the report here, just said, look, I don't care what the Pentagon tells me, we're going to show people these coffins.
[02:42:52.595 --> 02:42:56.238]  That really shows that there's some rebellion going on there.
[02:42:56.298 --> 02:42:56.979]  Jack McClam?
[02:42:57.039 --> 02:42:58.480]  Yes, there sure is.
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:00.782]  In talking to Kevin Venderman, he says that
[02:43:01.497 --> 02:43:09.244]  There's almost whole squads that are going AWOL right now and not going back to Iraq after they've been there the first time.
[02:43:09.765 --> 02:43:11.667]  So there are some good things happening.
[02:43:11.707 --> 02:43:18.613]  We've got some great soldiers and police officers that love God and freedom who are standing up today and private citizens by the millions, I think.
[02:43:19.114 --> 02:43:20.375]  So I'm hopeful.
[02:43:20.515 --> 02:43:23.398]  We here at our Police and Military Association are hopeful.
[02:43:24.065 --> 02:43:30.808]  It's just that we've got to get as much done as we can and awaken as many as we can before they do the next terrorism attack.
[02:43:30.828 --> 02:43:32.389]  Well, that's a question I got for Craig.
[02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:35.831]  I mean, they wanted to go into Syria, Iran, all these places.
[02:43:37.591 --> 02:43:39.132]  Are things not going well in Iraq?
[02:43:39.152 --> 02:43:42.794]  Is that going to keep the globalists from going in to these other countries?
[02:43:42.814 --> 02:43:49.317]  Or are we going to see another, as PNAC said, helpful terrorist event to get the people behind this expanded war?
[02:43:49.678 --> 02:43:53.998]  Well, you know, there's two or three different scenarios that could play out, and there's always more than one plan on the table.
[02:43:55.258 --> 02:44:06.106]  One of them is to link all of the support for the terrorists that are in Iraq today to Iran, and in order to shut off their logistical supply base, we've got to go into Iran.
[02:44:06.266 --> 02:44:06.987]  That's one way to do it.
[02:44:07.027 --> 02:44:07.887]  Same thing with Syria.
[02:44:08.007 --> 02:44:09.489]  We can say, well, they came from Syria.
[02:44:09.549 --> 02:44:10.449]  We can go into Syria.
[02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:20.677]  Syria would be easier to take than Iran would be, except Iran has... By the way, they've already announced, just like with Cambodia, our troops have already been in Syria for months, and now they're going to start more public attacks.
[02:44:21.417 --> 02:44:22.578]  So that's a way to widen it.
[02:44:22.598 --> 02:44:23.799]  Yeah, well...
[02:44:25.141 --> 02:44:28.222]  The other thing is, of course, get the rest of the world involved, too.
[02:44:28.282 --> 02:44:29.602]  Bring in all the U.N.
[02:44:29.782 --> 02:44:31.103]  and go the Somalia route.
[02:44:31.843 --> 02:44:38.284]  There are so many scenarios that can be played out because what you've got is a monopoly set and you've got all these players on the board.
[02:44:38.564 --> 02:44:39.825]  Which one are you going to move first?
[02:44:41.125 --> 02:44:45.446]  There's a limited number of options, but there are more than one option out there.
[02:44:45.806 --> 02:44:47.167]  And I think that's what we're going to have to look at.
[02:44:47.207 --> 02:44:48.689]  I think we're going to see the U.N.
[02:44:48.749 --> 02:44:48.989]  round.
[02:44:49.049 --> 02:44:51.251]  I think they're going to play the part of the good cop.
[02:44:51.911 --> 02:45:00.099]  I think that they're going to be called into this thing sooner or later, and we're going to have people like Germany and Italy and who all play in greater parts and things.
[02:45:00.439 --> 02:45:04.522]  The problem is what I don't want to see is those guys coming over here policing our streets.
[02:45:05.383 --> 02:45:07.305]  Well, that's the plan, as you know, Greg.
[02:45:07.405 --> 02:45:07.765]  Oh, I know.
[02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:13.051]  And by the way, for people who just tuned in, that's not a joke, okay?
[02:45:13.131 --> 02:45:16.172]  I've seen brass on television say it, on Nightline.
[02:45:16.852 --> 02:45:20.293]  Craig's had family that's, you know, in these war college meetings where they're saying it.
[02:45:20.593 --> 02:45:21.173]  He's read it.
[02:45:21.794 --> 02:45:23.834]  I mean, how many reports of this have you gotten, Jack?
[02:45:24.334 --> 02:45:39.459]  Well, a lot of these reports because we're totally taking all the fighting men and women out of this nation, the National Guard, the Reserves, the Army, of course, and during the VA, the Veterans Administration, or Veterans,
[02:45:39.881 --> 02:45:41.241]  Holiday that just passed.
[02:45:41.642 --> 02:45:44.623]  There was no military equipment to use in the parades here.
[02:45:44.963 --> 02:45:49.024]  They're totally denuding this nation of any fighting machinery or people.
[02:45:49.584 --> 02:45:58.327]  So when the next terrorism goes on, folks, let me tell you, the American people will accept foreign troops supervising them for their own safety.
[02:46:00.618 --> 02:46:06.446]  Hard to believe, but the Pentagon's been training for over a decade to do this and acclimating our troops to go along with it.
[02:46:07.307 --> 02:46:10.091]  It's got to be a huge attack, though, to get the people to accept it.
[02:46:10.111 --> 02:46:10.672]  That's right.
[02:46:10.852 --> 02:46:15.438]  Well, the last caller made a valid point, and I think we skipped over it too quickly, and he said he talked about the...
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:21.384]  The Moslem is being used to police certain streets in Russia because a Russian wouldn't shoot upon a Russian.
[02:46:21.404 --> 02:46:22.365]  Well, that's not exactly true.
[02:46:22.385 --> 02:46:23.246]  They do it all the time.
[02:46:23.706 --> 02:46:26.048]  But here, they did the poll.
[02:46:26.148 --> 02:46:29.811]  Remember, go back and they did the poll in California at 29 Palm.
[02:46:29.851 --> 02:46:31.312]  They've done a lot of those.
[02:46:31.332 --> 02:46:36.877]  They said that American troops, 90-something percent of them, would not shoot Americans to disarm them.
[02:46:36.917 --> 02:46:42.422]  And so now you get the American troops out and you bring somebody else in to disarm us and let them go door-to-door.
[02:46:42.462 --> 02:46:45.104]  By the way, this has been done with the Hessians, with the Germans.
[02:46:46.096 --> 02:46:52.198]  We've had German troops here as mercenaries twice, folks.
[02:46:52.218 --> 02:46:55.958]  They've got a base here, as a matter of fact, the Germans do.
[02:46:55.978 --> 02:46:58.059]  Turn the base over to them.
[02:46:58.099 --> 02:47:02.340]  There's more foreign troops at a lot of our bases right now than people realize.
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:07.901]  No, there's not a million Russian troops hiding in the northwest corner of the Rocky Mountains and all this stuff.
[02:47:07.921 --> 02:47:12.302]  That's all disinformation that's put out so that it can be discredited so we don't listen to this stuff anymore.
[02:47:12.842 --> 02:47:13.763]  You don't have to do that.
[02:47:14.243 --> 02:47:15.283]  You can put them in barracks.
[02:47:15.903 --> 02:47:18.986]  We've got military bases all over the place that house people we're training.
[02:47:19.006 --> 02:47:26.352]  You go to Fort Polk, Louisiana, on Operation Cooperative Nugget, and we're teaching them how to go door-to-door and take away guns.
[02:47:26.692 --> 02:47:30.295]  There's an Air Force base, too, just loaded with foreign troops over there.
[02:47:30.776 --> 02:47:30.976]  Right.
[02:47:30.996 --> 02:47:31.797]  Well, that's in Arizona.
[02:47:33.878 --> 02:47:36.800]  You've got the School of Americas.
[02:47:36.820 --> 02:47:41.204]  When I was at Fort Benning, we had all kinds of foreign officers going through our courses at Fort Benning.
[02:47:41.224 --> 02:47:42.605]  Let me give you an example.
[02:47:42.685 --> 02:47:53.713]  I've got the internal documents on the Texas Guard itself, and over it is a former SAS British officer, and he's over these domestic takeover units, and it is for domestic control.
[02:47:55.303 --> 02:47:55.663]  All right.
[02:47:55.883 --> 02:47:59.505]  Well, Jack McClam, I want to thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:47:59.525 --> 02:48:02.086]  Good to be back with you, Alex, and Craig, too.
[02:48:02.206 --> 02:48:03.927]  God bless you both for all you're doing.
[02:48:03.987 --> 02:48:06.709]  We cops and soldiers sure appreciate you.
[02:48:06.929 --> 02:48:12.652]  We all have kids and families, and everything you do is a blessing to us.
[02:48:12.712 --> 02:48:13.452]  So thank you both.
[02:48:14.674 --> 02:48:15.655]  Jack, we'll see you down range.
[02:48:15.955 --> 02:48:16.335]  All right.
[02:48:16.655 --> 02:48:17.636]  Yeah, thanks, Jack.
[02:48:17.716 --> 02:48:20.137]  I mean, the same to you, what you had to say.
[02:48:20.197 --> 02:48:20.538]  Thank you.
[02:48:20.938 --> 02:48:23.039]  All right, we're going to come back, take a final call.
[02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:25.020]  I think it was Jeremiah from Florida.
[02:48:25.781 --> 02:48:28.842]  And a number of a few other little tidbits of news here.
[02:48:28.903 --> 02:48:37.988]  And we'll wrap up this edition of, well, the Alex Jones Show, Real Talk Radio, real issues that actually affect you and your family.
[02:48:38.678 --> 02:48:40.760]  Not a bunch of mindless propaganda.
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.163]  We cut to the heart of the matter, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:46.444 --> 02:48:49.387]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?

[02:49:22.498 --> 02:49:24.260]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:52:08.129 --> 02:52:11.090]  Muhammad Adda and the Venice Flying Circus up about 9-11.
[02:52:11.671 --> 02:52:16.033]  My Dean Haglin interview, star of the X-Files, talking about government inside dollars of 9-11.
[02:52:16.873 --> 02:52:19.234]  Now he believes the government planted stories on them.
[02:52:19.254 --> 02:52:20.795]  That just went up this week.

[02:53:19.542 --> 02:53:23.285]  Alex, I can't tell you how I enjoy your show, and you people are the real heroes and patriots in this country, and
[02:53:49.434 --> 02:53:49.774]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:54:10.488 --> 02:54:13.990]  Sir, I'm going to tell you something.
[02:54:14.030 --> 02:54:21.973]  People say I'm going to be at events that I never said I was going to.
[02:54:22.093 --> 02:54:26.295]  I made billions in careers for many people in the music world.
[02:54:26.335 --> 02:54:31.637]  I never got a dime and probably don't deserve it, but I have a script for a movie and a TV show.
[02:54:32.219 --> 02:54:40.787]  And whether you're able to help me or not, if I get this... Well, all of us have our own talents, and you can leave your number, and I'll try to give you a call if I have time.
[02:54:40.807 --> 02:54:42.228]  But do you have any questions or comments?
[02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:54.438]  Yeah, I don't know what show, but there was a fan from Puerto Rico that was... I guess he was trying to bring charges against the president on the RICO law.
[02:54:54.458 --> 02:54:56.040]  Have you heard anything about that?
[02:54:56.747 --> 02:55:00.732]  I think Willie Gonzalez and I think Burr was the name of the lawyer.
[02:55:01.212 --> 02:55:04.977]  Well, there's been a lot of different lawsuits and a lot of different things happening.
[02:55:06.599 --> 02:55:13.366]  And a lot of people, I mean, most of the victims' families think the government was behind it, but you never see them on the news.
[02:55:13.627 --> 02:55:13.927]  No.
[02:55:14.468 --> 02:55:15.809]  Colonel Roberts, you got any comments?
[02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:16.270]  No.
[02:55:17.489 --> 02:55:17.789]  All right.
[02:55:17.829 --> 02:55:20.131]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call, Jeremiah.
[02:55:21.433 --> 02:55:22.594]  You can leave your number there if you'd like.
[02:55:23.234 --> 02:55:27.338]  But then everybody starts doing it, and really, I'm working 18 hours a day on average.
[02:55:27.638 --> 02:55:28.459]  It's hard to do it all.
[02:55:29.219 --> 02:55:30.581]  Craig, you think we're going to make it through this?
[02:55:30.621 --> 02:55:31.842]  I know with God's help we will.
[02:55:32.162 --> 02:55:32.462]  Oh, yeah.
[02:55:32.502 --> 02:55:38.247]  We went in the end, but we're going to go through a lot of trials and tribulations, and the whole war is going to be fought by a handful of people.
[02:55:38.708 --> 02:55:41.210]  I mean, that's just the way it's always been, and we have to know that.
[02:55:41.846 --> 02:55:45.727]  The thing about it is, our job is to be messengers and to get the truth out there.
[02:55:45.767 --> 02:55:47.688]  And what people do with it is up to them.
[02:55:48.188 --> 02:55:50.509]  But, you know, French author Emil Zola said this.
[02:55:50.549 --> 02:56:01.533]  He said, if you shut up the truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts through, it will blow up everything in its way.
[02:56:01.553 --> 02:56:02.854]  And I think that's what's happening now.
[02:56:02.914 --> 02:56:04.635]  They try to bury the truth and it's going to grow.
[02:56:04.955 --> 02:56:05.975]  I love that quote.
[02:56:07.236 --> 02:56:08.156]  I love that quote.
[02:56:08.812 --> 02:56:13.754]  Well, always a great pleasure and honor to have you on the broadcast with us, Craig.
[02:56:13.814 --> 02:56:14.675]  And take care, my friend.
[02:56:14.815 --> 02:56:15.415]  We'll see you later.
[02:56:15.435 --> 02:56:15.955]  God bless.
[02:56:16.055 --> 02:56:16.496]  Take care.
[02:56:17.016 --> 02:56:23.639]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on your AM and FM dial and Global Fort Wave as well and the Internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:23.679 --> 02:56:26.500]  And back tomorrow, 11 to 2, with a Friday edition.
[02:56:26.901 --> 02:56:27.901]  Be sure and join us.
[02:56:28.301 --> 02:56:30.922]  Now get out there and stand up against these evil creatures.
[02:56:31.303 --> 02:56:32.623]  Don't let them run your life.
[02:56:33.424 --> 02:56:34.004]  You're free.
[02:56:35.685 --> 02:56:36.265]  Hello, folks.
