[00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:05.084]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:06.826]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:08.707]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:10.129]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:11.730]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.354]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:20.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:24.743]  Welcome my friends.
[00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:28.025]  It is Friday the 7th day of October 2005.
[00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:33.449]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:42.775]  Coming up in the second hour, Jim Tucker, who we've been interviewing for a decade, is coming on to talk about his new book, the Bilderberg Journal.
[00:00:43.777 --> 00:01:12.434]  That we're incidentally carrying at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is more than a quarter century of covering and infiltrating and spying on and stealing from, in his own words, sneaking in and getting their documents, is more than a quarter century of infiltrating this enemy of free humans everywhere and exposing these international bankers and royalty that literally think we're a bunch of animals.
[00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:17.010]  So, Jim Tucker, really this is kind of a memoir, I would say.
[00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:28.407]  Just an index, though, of the highlights, the most important things that came out of each meeting, and the information that Jim was able to ferret out of them.
[00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:35.596]  Just an amazing book as it chronicles over a quarter century of investigation.
[00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:40.659]  I mean, he could write a book about one single infiltration, one single year.
[00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:55.966]  You know, the adventures, the arrests, the detainments, the climbing through drains, you know, under roads, sneaking through windows, being chased by men in dark sedans and dark sunglasses.
[00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:04.723]  And so we've added it to the bookstore at InfoWars.com and they can also call of course and get it at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:06.465]  And Jim Tucker is joining us
[00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:17.154]  Coming up in the next hour.
[00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:20.316]  Of course, we're going to have wide open phones today as well.
[00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:20.636]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:25.279]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.420]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.185]  Rove to testify again in grand jury's CIA leak probe.
[00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:42.250]  Prosecutors warning that Bush advisor could be indicted suggest new information may have emerged.
[00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:50.528]  This lends some credibility to some of the people out there saying that Karl Rove is going to be indicted.
[00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:53.969]  But we've always known he could be indicted.
[00:02:54.009 --> 00:03:00.051]  I mean, they've had a grand jury impaneled looking at that up in Chicago.
[00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.792]  But we saw similar things with Bill Clinton.
[00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:12.595]  And it seems that the elite likes to basically hold people's feet to the fire and have the sword of Damocles above their necks.
[00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:14.651]  Ready to guillotine them.
[00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.416]  We'll get into that article also.
[00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:18.358]  ABC News.
[00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.640]  19 terrorists deployed to hit subways.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.283]  Ah yes, right when there's news about Rowan Bush being in trouble, magically out of the jack-in-the-box pops out C.I.
[00:03:30.403 --> 00:03:30.663]  Ada.
[00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:35.465]  This time Lord Bloomberg warning everyone and then Bush gets to be the comforter.
[00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:36.886]  No, no, it's no problem.
[00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:37.386]  Don't worry.
[00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:38.866]  I'm your father figure.
[00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:39.707]  I'll keep you safe.
[00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:41.027]  Just give me control.
[00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:42.388]  Let me use the troops on you.
[00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:43.808]  Everything's fine.
[00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.889]  Wheels coming off
[00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:49.649]  White House's Bush-Cheney indictments pending.
[00:03:50.049 --> 00:04:02.134]  ABC News, usually a neocon mouthpiece, is now confirming through George Stephanopoulos that reliable sources claim Bush-Cheney indictments are coming down from the Valerie Plame grand jury probe.
[00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:05.476]  Well, we can only hope and pray.
[00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:12.158]  That would be fabulous, but not if people then think we've defeated the New World Order and we can go back to sleep.
[00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.080]  That would be the globalists just removing a birdcage liner
[00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.270]  And starting afresh.
[00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.071]  That's all this is.
[00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:20.991]  They're puppets.
[00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:25.054]  Bush will veto anti-torture law after Senate vote.
[00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:30.197]  Oh yeah, first they said torture's good, then they said, oh no, we're not for torture when people saw the images.
[00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:33.459]  Some of the screened images, that's the images they let you see.
[00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.901]  Okay, out of thousands of photos and videos.
[00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.343]  Now it's okay, we're for torture, and you know what?
[00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:41.723]  No laws against it.
[00:04:42.864 --> 00:04:44.105]  So we'll get into that too.
[00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:45.946]  There's just so much news today.
[00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:51.438]  Very important broadcast and the blockage is now gone.
[00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:57.401]  You can check out InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv to your heart's content.
[00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:58.341]  We hope you will.
[00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:03.844]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:05.859]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:11.807]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:17.334]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:19.237]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:05:19.377 --> 00:05:21.778]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.719]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.620]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.461]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.961]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.822]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:41.404]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:44.526]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:47.889]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.032]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:53.132 --> 00:05:55.114]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:56.855]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.097]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.951]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:06.173]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:09.174]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.274 --> 00:06:15.978]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:19.159]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.760]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.443]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethyl
[00:06:27.643 --> 00:06:27.963]  Let's go!
[00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:51.539]  803-4438.
[00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.040]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.382]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:08.763]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:10.664]  What happened to those prices?
[00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:12.905]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:20.469]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:21.469]  The result?
[00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:23.170]  Inflation was born.
[00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.731]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:28.595]  What can you do about it?
[00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:31.341]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:37.522]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[00:07:37.943 --> 00:07:43.106]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.047]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:48.169]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:50.350]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:05.326]  Big Brother.
[00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:07.068]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:08.870]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:10.331]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.092 --> 00:08:12.153]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.654 --> 00:08:16.598]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.838 --> 00:08:20.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:29.553]  It is Friday, my friends.
[00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:30.794]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:30.854 --> 00:08:40.181]  Jim Tucker coming on to talk about, well, really his memoir, but it's a chronicle of over a quarter century documenting the global elite's criminal activities.
[00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:43.323]  Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, and we're going to be carrying it.
[00:08:44.164 --> 00:08:45.164]  We have it in stock now.
[00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:53.350]  We're going to be posting the link to our shopping cart up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com so you can get that.
[00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.013]  He's coming on in the next hour, so we really look forward to that.
[00:08:58.092 --> 00:09:05.375]  Can you imagine the fact that the Senate's trying to pass a law just regulating torture?
[00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:06.875]  Which is bad enough.
[00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:10.117]  But hey, you can't beat somebody to death.
[00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:11.557]  You can just torture them a little bit.
[00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:13.758]  Oh, no, we're not going to have that.
[00:09:13.778 --> 00:09:14.779]  We're not going to have a law.
[00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:15.739]  Nope.
[00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:17.384]  But wait a minute.
[00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.185]  You told the troops to torture the people.
[00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:24.766]  When they did torture them, you put them in prison and said that you were against torture.
[00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:29.588]  But we have you all over the news before that scandal broke, saying torture was good.
[00:09:29.948 --> 00:09:37.070]  And now you are saying you'll veto a law just regulating torture, which is bad enough.
[00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:38.963]  You see, this is how they do it.
[00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:40.184]  They give you false choices.
[00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:48.249]  Either you accept the UN coming in and telling you how to run your country and what you can and can't do, or the United States comes in and invades you.
[00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.952]  Either way, you're dominated, subjugated control.
[00:09:53.213 --> 00:09:54.073]  Under total control.
[00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:56.995]  Well, it's the same thing with torture.
[00:09:57.476 --> 00:10:01.238]  Well, we're just going to regulate and control torture and have some restrictions on it.
[00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:01.879]  No!
[00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:02.319]  No!
[00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:03.420]  No restrictions!
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:03.900]  No!
[00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.262]  We want all-out total torture!
[00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:12.459]  We can beat them to death, we can torture them to death, and if they die, why is it torture?
[00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:18.625]  Alberto Gonzalez said in multiple memos advising President Bush is as cheap as his chief counsel.
[00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:20.727]  He said, cheap counsel.
[00:10:21.928 --> 00:10:23.890]  It's become a weird Freudian slip.
[00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.455]  Yes, his chief counsel, giving him cheap advice.
[00:10:30.285 --> 00:10:36.952]  So now though, it comes out that they want to control and restrict torture, and absolutely not!
[00:10:37.472 --> 00:10:39.174]  We are going to stop you.
[00:10:39.214 --> 00:10:42.537]  We are not about to allow that to happen.
[00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:45.080]  So can there be any doubt?
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.842]  This is on the London Telegraph today.
[00:10:47.202 --> 00:10:50.986]  Bush will veto anti-torture law after Senate revolt.
[00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:58.052]  The Bush administration pledged to veto legislation banning the torture of prisoners by U.S.
[00:10:58.072 --> 00:11:03.773]  troops after an overwhelming and almost unprecedented vote by loyalist congressmen.
[00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:12.596]  The mutiny was the latest setback for an administration facing an increasingly independent and bloody-minded legislature.
[00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:23.713]  But it also marked a key moment in Congress' campaign to curtail the huge powers it has granted the White House since the 2001 War Against Terrorism.
[00:11:24.613 --> 00:11:33.978]  The late-night Senate vote saw the measure forbidding torture passed by 90 to 9, it actually just restricts it, with most Republicans backing the measure.
[00:11:34.338 --> 00:11:39.601]  Most senators said the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal and similar allegations at the Guantanamo Bay prison
[00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:43.990]  ...rendered the result of a foregone conclusion.
[00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:52.115]  The administration's extraordinary isolation was underlined when the Senate Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, supported the amendment.
[00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:53.556]  Well, they have to!
[00:11:54.636 --> 00:12:10.286]  I mean, you can't... Do you understand that the Army's own report says that 75 to 90 percent of those at the 32 camps in Iraq, with tens of thousands of people in them, are families who didn't have their papers in order at checkpoints?
[00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.711]  You imagine pulling up to a checkpoint.
[00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:13.472]  It's your family.
[00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:15.153]  You're in there with your wife and children.
[00:12:16.314 --> 00:12:19.957]  And you don't have all your papers in order, so they drag you out of the vehicle.
[00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:23.799]  They give your car to some Iraqi loyalists who go sell it.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.981]  That's been all over the foreign press.
[00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:29.884]  The looting by the troops, by the Iraqi troops predominantly.
[00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:33.907]  The former Ba'athists, they just put all those thugs back in power.
[00:12:34.247 --> 00:12:36.389]  All CIA trained killers going back to the 80's.
[00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.451]  You know, the new army of freedom they've put in over there.
[00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:41.692]  That's why the people are revolting.
[00:12:41.712 --> 00:12:43.333]  They're like, they're putting in all the Ba'athists again.
[00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:47.195]  Especially our Shiite buddies are now getting angry.
[00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:57.041]  But to bring it along for short, they've been being taken to a camp where horrible, degenerate, demonic, former federal prison guards are just waiting.
[00:12:57.181 --> 00:12:58.282]  And it is admitted!
[00:12:58.822 --> 00:13:02.404]  I mean, Cy Hirsch has reported on it in the New Yorker.
[00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:03.925]  It's been reported on in the BBC.
[00:13:04.938 --> 00:13:10.880]  They take young children, ladies and gentlemen, and rape them in front of their parents.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.161]  They rape men's wives in front of them.
[00:13:15.201 --> 00:13:16.582]  They rape young women.
[00:13:17.782 --> 00:13:19.223]  They beat people to death.
[00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:22.884]  And yes, it's been reported by credible sources, and we even have the photographs.
[00:13:23.284 --> 00:13:25.105]  They then harvest their organs.
[00:13:26.525 --> 00:13:31.427]  It is so grisly, it makes your head spin.
[00:13:34.608 --> 00:13:44.598]  Americans were always known in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, we weren't the guys that committed the atrocities.
[00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:53.246]  We weren't perfect, but we were always, even by foreign historians, looked at in a good light as being the good guys, wearing the white hats.
[00:13:53.807 --> 00:13:55.488]  Very limited raping and killing.
[00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:57.210]  Very limited torture.
[00:13:57.871 --> 00:13:59.152]  If it happened, it was punished.
[00:14:00.057 --> 00:14:01.658]  By a firing squad in many cases.
[00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:04.179]  Not anymore, not anymore.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.761]  We are known as the Army of Death.
[00:14:07.521 --> 00:14:08.862]  I mean, people do cringe.
[00:14:09.703 --> 00:14:18.248]  Literally, I've got so many Reuters and AP photos and video of the tanks with blood smeared on it, red paint, human skulls adorning antennas.
[00:14:18.268 --> 00:14:21.610]  You know, they drill a hole in a skull and put it down over the antenna.
[00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.332]  666 the Beast, heavy metal music blaring.
[00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:28.001]  I mean, I've seen video clips of this on the web.
[00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:29.322]  They trade this on the web.
[00:14:29.342 --> 00:14:38.843]  There's a whole industry of dead bodies and how much Satan worship you've got on your tank or helicopter and they're riding around playing the most evil death metal you can imagine.
[00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:40.984]  Murder, slaughter, Satan!
[00:14:41.004 --> 00:14:42.824]  Blah!
[00:14:42.844 --> 00:14:45.424]  I mean, that's the type of music, this death metal.
[00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:47.085]  We're coming for you, man!
[00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:48.545]  You're the power of the fire!
[00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:50.545]  Death, death, death, death, death, blah!
[00:14:50.885 --> 00:14:53.486]  The tanks and the fire just rolling forward with 666 on them.
[00:14:55.638 --> 00:14:56.338]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:14:56.358 --> 00:15:07.224]  Can you imagine these third world primitive population in those rural areas of Iraq as the tanks roll through with 666 and red paint splattered all over it?
[00:15:09.545 --> 00:15:10.586]  Skulls adorning.
[00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:12.427]  I mean, that's what the bad guys always did.
[00:15:12.447 --> 00:15:17.329]  You know, I went this weekend, took a few hours off and went and saw that sci-fi movie Serenity with my wife.
[00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:19.090]  It was a pretty action-packed, pretty good movie.
[00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:21.731]  Don't take your children as violent.
[00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:23.072]  But the point is, I like science fiction.
[00:15:23.092 --> 00:15:23.652]  I went and saw it.
[00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:24.473]  Forgive me.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:32.345]  And, uh, you know, the evil people in the movie have skulls and blood all over their spaceships and dead bodies hanging off of them.
[00:15:32.445 --> 00:15:35.167]  I mean, you know, it's just that archetypal image.
[00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:39.129]  I mean, the villains in sci-fi movies are how our troops pay.
[00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.592]  Literally blaring satanic music with 666 all over it.
[00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:46.174]  I mean, that is very popular.
[00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:49.837]  Alright, I'm... I'm ranting here.
[00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:54.820]  It's just that Bush will veto anti-torture law after Senate revolt.
[00:15:57.293 --> 00:15:59.495]  And there's another degenerate who wouldn't do it either.
[00:15:59.955 --> 00:16:02.638]  Kansas Senator refuses to sign a bill banning torture.
[00:16:02.718 --> 00:16:02.898]  U.S.
[00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:10.164]  Senator Pat Roberts says he doesn't condone torture, but he believes that terror suspects have information that can save innocent American lives.
[00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:11.685]  Boy, that is doublespeak.
[00:16:11.725 --> 00:16:14.728]  I don't believe in condoning torture, but I think we should do it.
[00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:19.212]  One of the most valuable tools we have in getting this information is terror.
[00:16:19.432 --> 00:16:20.873]  Fear of the unknown, Roberts.
[00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:25.277]  A Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee told the Journal
[00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:27.217]  World on Thursday.
[00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:35.819]  That's why Roberts was part of a small minority Wednesday to oppose Senate measure banning cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of prisoners held by U.S.
[00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:36.199]  forces.
[00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:40.480]  The act passed 90-9 with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.440]  I just want to tell the military and special teams here in the U.S.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.620]  and all of you something.
[00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:49.801]  You will get caught doing this domestically or internationally.
[00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:53.162]  You will get in trouble and your bosses will hang you out to dry.
[00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:54.422]  Don't do it.
[00:16:56.681 --> 00:17:06.284]  And again, we know, according to major publications, that no major member of Al-Qaeda or the Taliban is at Camp X-Ray at Gitmo in Cuba.
[00:17:07.804 --> 00:17:16.647]  We know that when special forces capture generals, colonels in Al-Qaeda or the Taliban, we're talking San Francisco Chronicle AP folks, they are ordered to release them.
[00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:24.829]  And the colonels and generals have even gone public and then been relieved from command, and the newspaper going, we have the number one guy, we're ordered to release him.
[00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:29.762]  Well, of course you were ordered to release CIA officers!
[00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:34.023]  Soldier, you follow orders, boy!
[00:17:34.043 --> 00:17:35.424]  This is part of something bigger!
[00:17:36.784 --> 00:17:37.705]  But we had them!
[00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:40.065]  We had them all!
[00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:45.847]  In fact, you didn't just order us to release their top general, we had to load them on planes and give them a ride into Pakistan!
[00:17:46.658 --> 00:17:48.599]  And then we saw him give them those big crates.
[00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:49.980]  And we know what was in those crates.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.540]  It was gold.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.220]  What are you doing?
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.461]  Shut up, soldier.
[00:17:52.481 --> 00:17:54.001]  It's part of a bigger plan.
[00:17:54.522 --> 00:17:56.983]  Little pea brains like you don't need to know about it.
[00:17:57.683 --> 00:17:59.944]  Well, little pea brains like you aren't pea brains.
[00:18:00.404 --> 00:18:02.345]  And you're beginning to learn and beginning to find out.
[00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:04.626]  These are technicians.
[00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:08.088]  These Arab terrorists work for the globalists.
[00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:09.228]  They have since the 1950s.
[00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:13.922]  They were conceived by the New World Order.
[00:18:14.242 --> 00:18:16.522]  They were forged by the New World Order.
[00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:33.965]  They have been shepherded, and nursed, and loved, and pruned, and watered, and given light, and grown into strong, hateful killers living in lavish compounds with millions of dollars in their Swiss bank accounts.
[00:18:34.665 --> 00:18:38.486]  They are merc killers, trained in the most elite U.S.
[00:18:38.546 --> 00:18:39.006]  bases,
[00:18:40.282 --> 00:18:42.886]  And I have all the documents, all the articles, it's all public.
[00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:47.192]  And every day, terrorists are about to get us.
[00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:48.554]  They'll get us any minute.
[00:18:48.574 --> 00:18:51.878]  They always grab, literally, some retarded individual.
[00:18:51.898 --> 00:18:53.641]  Hitler did the same thing after the Reichstag.
[00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:57.186]  They'll grab somebody who's a low-grade moron who can't even hardly talk.
[00:18:57.976 --> 00:19:00.837]  And, uh, they will, uh, this is your top mastermind.
[00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:07.600]  By the way, even the mainstream news is starting to go, this Al Zawahiri guy, now they say they've captured, you know, or killed him over ten times.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.881]  I mean, every month they capture or kill him again.
[00:19:10.361 --> 00:19:14.902]  And so even mainstream blogs and cartoons and news articles are making jokes about it.
[00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:18.864]  Uh, and you gotta ask, why do they lie?
[00:19:19.975 --> 00:19:21.957]  And not even change the lie.
[00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:23.238]  It's a test.
[00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:28.643]  Because if they can say, we killed Goldstein, we captured Goldstein, Goldstein is alive.
[00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:30.244]  That happened in 1984.
[00:19:30.284 --> 00:19:33.507]  They were always killing this boogeyman.
[00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:35.048]  Every problem was caused by him.
[00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:35.809]  Goldstein.
[00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.771]  And he would always pop back up.
[00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:41.354]  And Big Brother, on purpose, to train you how to engage in double think.
[00:19:42.134 --> 00:19:43.756]  You're being trained, see, to accept this.
[00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:47.413]  And see, millions of Americans are going, are learning to go, no, he was killed.
[00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:48.155]  No, he wasn't killed.
[00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:48.976]  He's been captured.
[00:19:48.996 --> 00:19:49.697]  No, he wasn't captured.
[00:19:50.017 --> 00:19:51.139]  He's been dead five times.
[00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:52.320]  No, he's been captured ten times.
[00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:57.448]  And then, and then there's never a retraction of, well, then he, was he killed or wasn't he?
[00:20:01.698 --> 00:20:03.299]  Government is death which governs me.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.181]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.323]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:20:08.764 --> 00:20:11.426]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[00:24:14.873 --> 00:24:21.317]  Remember when the Senate confirmed Alberto, I love torture, Bush is above the law, Gonzalez?
[00:24:22.558 --> 00:24:27.361]  They brought up torture to him and he wouldn't even say it was wrong or say that his memos were evil.
[00:24:29.122 --> 00:24:30.663]  He just said, hey, I'll stand behind it.
[00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:32.725]  And they said, alright, we confirm you.
[00:24:33.645 --> 00:24:35.987]  So I don't completely trust this vote in the Senate.
[00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:40.830]  By the way, if Bush vetoes this, they can just have two-thirds of the House and Senate vote on it.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.581]  We can get two-thirds of the House to vote on it, then we can get this law in.
[00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:53.563]  But I was looking at some analysis of the law, and the reports are that it really just tries to regulate it and define it.
[00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:56.264]  So in a way, it's actually codifying it.
[00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:59.644]  But I've got to look a little bit more closely at the law.
[00:24:59.724 --> 00:25:04.266]  I saw an article analyzing it, and then I went and tried to look at the law and ran out of time this morning.
[00:25:04.306 --> 00:25:07.646]  But it looks sneaky right now.
[00:25:07.726 --> 00:25:10.227]  But regardless, it's an education.
[00:25:12.276 --> 00:25:16.318]  That we've got senators going, hey, I don't like torture, but it sure works.
[00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:17.539]  No, it doesn't.
[00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:21.601]  You can't believe a government that will torture the people.
[00:25:22.081 --> 00:25:24.623]  You can't believe confessions that come from torture.
[00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.124]  Everybody knows that.
[00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:31.186]  It is another telltale earmark.
[00:25:31.887 --> 00:25:39.251]  Telltale earmark, signature, wavelength, absolute flag.
[00:25:42.782 --> 00:25:49.445]  Letting you know, without a shadow of a doubt, you've got a despotic, corrupt, tyrannical government.
[00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:51.306]  I mean, home of the free, land of the brave?
[00:25:51.806 --> 00:25:57.169]  Where our president goes, I'm going to veto a law just restricting, regulating torture?
[00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:58.169]  No!
[00:25:58.229 --> 00:25:59.170]  We're in a war!
[00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.691]  We've been attacked by terrorists!
[00:26:00.731 --> 00:26:08.594]  And listen, there was a full court press to legitimize torture long before 9-11.
[00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:11.836]  We had written articles about it, I'd covered it in documentary films.
[00:26:12.569 --> 00:26:17.731]  I mean, I would just be at a 7-Eleven and buy the firearms and weapons of law enforcement.
[00:26:20.172 --> 00:26:20.732]  What was that?
[00:26:20.752 --> 00:26:22.373]  I think it was the April 2000 issue.
[00:26:22.413 --> 00:26:24.794]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:26:24.814 --> 00:26:27.134]  It was five years ago, but it's somewhere in the stacks.
[00:26:27.314 --> 00:26:28.615]  I covered it on air several times.
[00:26:29.075 --> 00:26:30.075]  This is just one example.
[00:26:30.136 --> 00:26:32.176]  And I grab it, and I just open it.
[00:26:32.616 --> 00:26:33.557]  And there's a big article.
[00:26:33.597 --> 00:26:34.757]  Just the first thing that opens up.
[00:26:34.797 --> 00:26:35.998]  I wasn't even going to buy the magazine.
[00:26:36.038 --> 00:26:37.498]  I just, something said, pick it up.
[00:26:37.518 --> 00:26:39.419]  So I open it up, and it said,
[00:26:40.436 --> 00:26:42.477]  You know, oh, torture is wonderful.
[00:26:42.537 --> 00:26:46.498]  We think of it as bad, but America was built on torture, and torture is really good.
[00:26:46.998 --> 00:26:47.858]  Here's an example.
[00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:50.038]  Smallpox bombs are going to be released.
[00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:52.959]  Will you torture the terrorist to get the answers?
[00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:53.859]  Obviously, yes.
[00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:54.780]  Torture is good.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.621]  A nuke is about to go off, and the terrorist won't tell you the codes.
[00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:02.461]  Will you torture him to get the answers?
[00:27:03.342 --> 00:27:08.423]  And so they play these little psychological games with you.
[00:27:09.554 --> 00:27:10.756]  And that's what cults do.
[00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:18.449]  They get you to get your mind in these weird thought processes and then try to change your moral compass to condition you.
[00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:25.061]  I mean, how many real cases are there going to be if they've got the anthrax bombs, or they're about to release a nuke on everybody?
[00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:29.743]  But it's that same psychology, then, that I've seen used a thousand places.
[00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:38.247]  Well, one of the bombs is about to go off in a building with a hundred Marines in it, and the terrorists won't tell you where the bomb is.
[00:27:38.287 --> 00:27:39.087]  Do you torture him?
[00:27:39.387 --> 00:27:40.187]  Of course you do!
[00:27:40.267 --> 00:27:41.348]  It saves lives!
[00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:43.969]  But that isn't what torture is really about.
[00:27:44.489 --> 00:27:45.850]  Torture is about terror.
[00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.692]  Torture is about fear.
[00:27:48.052 --> 00:27:49.873]  Torture is about subjugation.
[00:27:50.193 --> 00:27:52.295]  Torture is about false confessions.
[00:27:53.016 --> 00:27:54.677]  Torture is about submission.
[00:27:56.658 --> 00:28:01.762]  I mean, if we're going to buy into this argument that torture is good, then we've got to say that the Nazis were good.
[00:28:03.283 --> 00:28:05.865]  They were big proponents of torture.
[00:28:07.126 --> 00:28:08.047]  So were the Russians.
[00:28:09.434 --> 00:28:12.316]  When they captured soldiers, they would torture them in many cases.
[00:28:12.537 --> 00:28:13.377]  So would the Nazis.
[00:28:13.437 --> 00:28:18.742]  So, we've got to say the Red Terror was good, and we've got to say the Nazis were good.
[00:28:18.762 --> 00:28:22.284]  We've got to say that Joseph Mingala was good.
[00:28:22.344 --> 00:28:23.966]  But no, that's double think.
[00:28:24.486 --> 00:28:29.170]  No, I'm against torture when somebody else does it, but when we do it, it's good.
[00:28:31.112 --> 00:28:34.034]  In fact, remember, Saddam Hussein's got to be invaded.
[00:28:34.094 --> 00:28:34.795]  He's bad.
[00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:36.356]  He's got rape rooms.
[00:28:37.461 --> 00:28:39.503]  Rape rooms out at the old airport.
[00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:42.926]  Yeah, that our government helped pay for in the 80s.
[00:28:42.946 --> 00:28:44.628]  I mean, this was our boy.
[00:28:45.248 --> 00:28:48.651]  Why, Saddam Hussein tortures people sometimes.
[00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:50.373]  He tortures.
[00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:52.174]  Bush gave speeches about it, remember?
[00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:54.677]  Remember all those speeches?
[00:28:55.938 --> 00:28:56.779]  And then...
[00:28:59.762 --> 00:29:05.746]  Our troops move into the very same barracks, take up the same practice, in fact, on a wider scale, and it's good.
[00:29:06.106 --> 00:29:17.954]  But then, when the people get outraged by some of the milquetoast photos, compared to the real photos that were held back by Congress, oh, then, we've got to send people to prison.
[00:29:18.874 --> 00:29:25.739]  But, understand, they go to prison, England and Sergeant Grainer and all of them, but
[00:29:26.838 --> 00:29:30.641]  Then, Alberto Gonzalez gets up there and says, yeah, I wrote a memo saying torture people.
[00:29:30.822 --> 00:29:31.742]  They go, oh, you're confirmed.
[00:29:32.623 --> 00:29:33.804]  See how that's double think?
[00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:35.446]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:29:35.746 --> 00:29:41.411]  And then Bush says, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let this stand trying to even restrict me in torture.
[00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:42.572]  Torture's good.
[00:29:42.592 --> 00:29:43.773]  I'm going to veto you.
[00:29:44.894 --> 00:29:46.676]  And then this Kansas Senator does the same thing.
[00:29:46.956 --> 00:29:48.597]  We'll come back, cover more news, take your calls.
[00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:51.600]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.542]  The empire's on the run.

[00:32:05.196 --> 00:32:10.582]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:32:10.822 --> 00:32:12.344]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:32:12.384 --> 00:32:14.626]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:18.310]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.711]  And they can do it without due process.
[00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:27.714]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.

[00:33:15.553 --> 00:33:17.634]  Calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:18.695 --> 00:33:22.318]  Jim Tucker in the next hour with his Bilderberg diary.
[00:33:22.838 --> 00:33:26.641]  Over a quarter century of reporting on this criminal organization.
[00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:28.582]  Just amazing historical work.
[00:33:30.484 --> 00:33:38.970]  Look, what's happening is that we're all getting acclimated, we're all getting desensitized, we're all getting prepared, or jaded.
[00:33:40.228 --> 00:33:43.871]  By just constant announcements, torture, torture, torture, torture.
[00:33:43.991 --> 00:33:45.673]  Okay, they're beating people to death.
[00:33:46.293 --> 00:33:49.096]  Okay, they're raping women in front of their husbands and worse.
[00:33:49.796 --> 00:33:54.701]  Okay, they're pouring battery acid on people and doing things we can't mention here on air.
[00:33:55.121 --> 00:34:03.869]  Okay, they were ordered to do it, but the troops will go to jail, but then the people who ordered them to publicly won't get in trouble and will be promoted and
[00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:24.685]  The President says he's against torture, but he's going to veto a law against torture, and Tommy Thompson is traveling the country saying we all need implantable microchips, and we're going to have a New World Order, and we're going to have a Pan-American Union, and we're going to get rid of your borders, and we're going to use troops on the American people to keep you safe.
[00:34:25.225 --> 00:34:26.966]  Got to get rid of that federal law.
[00:34:27.047 --> 00:34:28.087]  It's a felony.
[00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:28.788]  It's illegal.
[00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:33.372]  You know, just all of this, every day, we hear it over and over and over again until
[00:34:34.523 --> 00:34:36.184]  I'm even just getting accustomed to it.
[00:34:36.424 --> 00:34:41.466]  I mean, five years ago, the stuff that was happening right now, I'd be much more upset.
[00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.908]  But, incrementally, we're being prepared.
[00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.088]  We don't like what's happening.
[00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:50.391]  And see, they're carrying out actual psychological warfare tactics.
[00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:55.233]  They could have 15 different top boogeymen who they teach you to fear.
[00:34:56.274 --> 00:35:01.676]  But notice, right before the Gulf War, Bush actually said, I don't care about Bin Laden anymore.
[00:35:01.696 --> 00:35:02.377]  Forget about him.
[00:35:02.397 --> 00:35:03.097]  He's not a threat.
[00:35:03.943 --> 00:35:04.884]  It's Saddam.
[00:35:05.264 --> 00:35:13.768]  And they literally moved all of our hatred in the 10 minutes of hate, that's an Orwellian term for those who don't know, over to Saddam.
[00:35:14.288 --> 00:35:19.691]  And then most Americans in major polls believed that Bin Laden and Saddam were one and the same.
[00:35:19.771 --> 00:35:22.953]  I mean, that's how brainwashed people had gotten.
[00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:24.974]  Folks are starting to wake up from it, though.
[00:35:25.632 --> 00:35:53.825]  uh... in many respects and I thought he had attacked us and uh... you know he was bin laden and there was people calling to talk shows and go I think we should go over there and get bin laden invaded I mean Saddam well we know bin laden is being shepherded and protected by him and total desensitization and on purpose they have announced now I mean I quit counting I know it's over ten times that they've killed and captured
[00:35:55.155 --> 00:36:11.450]  Al-Zawahiri, Zakari, however you pronounce the idiot's name, and then it tracks back that he's been connected to KGB and CIA in the 80s and 90s and being protected, and this one-legged guy's running around all over three countries at the same time.
[00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:17.816]  You know, any time some farmers get mad and fight back against our troops that have just bulldozed their 500-year-old orchard,
[00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:23.930]  Every time somebody refuses to go along with something.
[00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.075]  Every time anything happens.
[00:36:25.942 --> 00:36:27.382]  It's, it's, it's Al Qaeda!
[00:36:27.903 --> 00:36:30.363]  It's just instantly announced on the news, Al Qaeda did this!
[00:36:30.823 --> 00:36:31.824]  Al Qaeda did that!
[00:36:32.264 --> 00:36:33.724]  Al Qaeda's behind everything!
[00:36:33.944 --> 00:36:42.346]  Then we catch SAS dressed up in big, fake beards, running around in turbans and headdresses, you know, shooting with bombs they're trying to plant.
[00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:48.208]  Same thing with the Russian government, caught over and over again, carrying out bombings and shootings and blaming it on their enemies.
[00:36:48.508 --> 00:36:50.408]  Same thing with the Brits, same thing with our government.
[00:36:50.768 --> 00:36:52.469]  Israel's been caught over and over doing it.
[00:36:52.749 --> 00:36:53.429]  Red-handed!
[00:36:54.727 --> 00:36:57.108]  And I know I talk a lot about this, but it's important.
[00:36:57.728 --> 00:36:59.969]  But why do they announce they've killed the same guy?
[00:37:00.429 --> 00:37:01.449]  It's over ten times now.
[00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:10.252]  In fact, there's a cartoon by one of these sites that takes pictures of Bush and puts little thought bubbles up.
[00:37:10.272 --> 00:37:11.773]  We got it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:12.893 --> 00:37:17.675]  I don't have it in front of me, but it's, you know, we really made progress in the war on terror.
[00:37:17.695 --> 00:37:21.816]  Yes, we've captured and killed Al Qaeda's number two man fourteen times.
[00:37:23.098 --> 00:37:31.824]  And you know, I bring this up to people on talk shows now, and they go, yeah, I do notice they, and they never retract, well, okay, if you killed him this time, then what about the last four times?
[00:37:32.445 --> 00:37:33.566]  Did you kill him those times?
[00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:34.866]  Because you never retracted those.
[00:37:34.967 --> 00:37:37.668]  Or, they'll capture and kill him in the same week.
[00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:40.691]  I mean, I, last time I counted it up, it was ten times.
[00:37:41.211 --> 00:37:43.693]  I mean, it's now on a monthly basis.
[00:37:46.088 --> 00:37:46.789]  Why are they?
[00:37:46.909 --> 00:37:47.930]  It's on purpose.
[00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:55.816]  They're setting the precedent to say, we have never been at war with East Asia, and the next day say, we've always been at war with East Asia.
[00:37:57.057 --> 00:38:02.821]  They're setting us up to say, up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black, left is right, right is left.
[00:38:04.523 --> 00:38:07.225]  They are training us that 180 is 360.
[00:38:08.006 --> 00:38:12.269]  They are training us that just, I'm against torture, but I'm going to veto this because I'm for torture.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.721]  I mean, look at this Kansas Senator, his quote.
[00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.343]  Let me just grab the quote here again.
[00:38:20.244 --> 00:38:21.405]  Oh, where is it?
[00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:22.766]  It's here in the stack.
[00:38:23.407 --> 00:38:23.827]  Oh, here it is.
[00:38:23.847 --> 00:38:27.430]  Let me find the quote here.
[00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:33.615]  Bush administration pledged yesterday to veto legislation banning the torture of prisoners by U.S.
[00:38:33.655 --> 00:38:37.378]  troops after an overwhelming and almost unprecedented revolt of loyalist congressmen.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.242]  And they've got a quote here by the Senator.
[00:38:46.186 --> 00:38:47.287]  I have to read the whole thing to find it.
[00:38:47.307 --> 00:38:48.348]  For some reason I can't find it.
[00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:12.718]  A late-night Senate vote saw the measure forbidding torture pass 90-9 with most Republicans backing the measure.
[00:39:13.258 --> 00:39:20.581]  Most Senators said the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal and similar allegations at the Guantanamo Bay prison regarded the result of foregone conclusion.
[00:39:22.341 --> 00:39:26.062]  The administration's own lovey-dovey minion Bill Frist supported the amendment.
[00:39:27.563 --> 00:39:29.643]  By the way, he was a speaker this year at Bohemian Grove.
[00:39:29.663 --> 00:39:31.764]  We got the internal guest list.
[00:39:31.824 --> 00:39:34.325]  Not guest list, lakeside chat speaker list.
[00:39:34.941 --> 00:39:35.761]  So is David Gergen.
[00:39:35.781 --> 00:39:36.902]  That's going to be in the new film.
[00:39:38.602 --> 00:39:44.924]  The man behind the legislation, Republican Senator John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner in Vietnam, that's not true.
[00:39:44.964 --> 00:39:47.724]  He was in the lavish area because he turn-coded.
[00:39:47.744 --> 00:39:53.226]  Now, we've had people that were there in the camp with him on the show, by the way.
[00:39:55.057 --> 00:39:57.402]  Very helpful, getting information out of our people.
[00:39:57.843 --> 00:40:01.551]  The man behind the legends, I know, but they say he's a hero, so get mad at me.
[00:40:01.812 --> 00:40:05.099]  He's a hero, the men that were in there with him, they're not, so just believe McCain, I know.
[00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.832]  I've actually attacked McCain before and gotten hateful emails.
[00:40:08.872 --> 00:40:10.372]  He's an incredible patriot!
[00:40:10.933 --> 00:40:12.674]  Yeah, he wants your guns too, you fools.
[00:40:13.254 --> 00:40:22.819]  The man behind the legislation, Republican Senator John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner in Vietnam, said the move was backed by Republican and American soldiers.
[00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:29.923]  His amendment would prohibit the cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of prisoners in the custody of American Defense Department.
[00:40:32.955 --> 00:40:33.835]  Where is that quote?
[00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:35.916]  Is that another article where a Senator said that?
[00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:38.276]  It's driving me crazy.
[00:40:38.577 --> 00:40:49.880]  I've got a Kansas Senator quote in one of these articles where he says that, uh, I voted against it because I don't like torture.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.460]  But we've got to pressure people.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.700]  Where is that?
[00:40:53.821 --> 00:40:56.221]  Having a... Oh, here it is.
[00:40:56.281 --> 00:40:57.882]  It's another article, as I thought.
[00:40:59.162 --> 00:41:01.763]  Kansas Senator refuses to sign bill banning torture.
[00:41:04.176 --> 00:41:04.296]  U.S.
[00:41:04.316 --> 00:41:10.860]  Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican in Kansas, says he doesn't condone torture, but he believes that terror suspects have information that can save innocent lives.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.663]  One of the most valuable tools we have is getting this information is terrorists, fear of the unknown.
[00:41:15.983 --> 00:41:17.844]  So, I mean, total double think.
[00:41:17.904 --> 00:41:18.204]  Alright.
[00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:23.827]  We'll, uh, we'll go ahead and take some calls and get back into all the other news.
[00:41:24.268 --> 00:41:29.391]  Talk of impending indictments of Lord Rove, now in the New York Times.
[00:41:30.111 --> 00:41:31.432]  Did it go as high as Bush?
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.741]  Hmm, we'll find out.
[00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:40.142]  And meanwhile, on the heels of that, subway alerts.
[00:41:41.382 --> 00:41:43.062]  Oh, the bombers are gonna get us.
[00:41:44.983 --> 00:41:48.944]  Let's go ahead and talk to our caller in California.
[00:41:48.984 --> 00:41:50.204]  Caller, what's your name?
[00:41:50.464 --> 00:41:51.004]  Leandro.
[00:41:51.544 --> 00:41:52.565]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[00:41:52.605 --> 00:41:53.285]  What's on your mind?
[00:41:53.505 --> 00:41:54.205]  Oh, what's on my mind?
[00:41:54.585 --> 00:42:02.087]  I called your show in a couple days ago talking about, actually, when the whole Roadrunner thing came up, and you told me to call Roadrunner myself, so I did.
[00:42:02.916 --> 00:42:06.699]  I called the local office here, and they had no clue about what was going on.
[00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:09.341]  Yeah, we've already pretty much put that one to bed.
[00:42:09.361 --> 00:42:12.983]  There was an internal DNS problem, which they continually engage in.
[00:42:13.004 --> 00:42:14.925]  Well, my story goes on further, actually.
[00:42:15.425 --> 00:42:18.508]  I called in, right, and the National Hotline was totally clueless.
[00:42:18.988 --> 00:42:23.591]  Then I got transferred to their tech department here in town, and they were totally clueless that day.
[00:42:23.651 --> 00:42:26.393]  So I got pissed off, gave up, and talked to my girlfriend.
[00:42:26.433 --> 00:42:27.474]  I said, I'm going to cancel the service.
[00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:28.575]  So the next day, I called back.
[00:42:29.204 --> 00:42:30.325]  And they right away knew who I was.
[00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:37.789]  And the lady on the phone who answered, here in Bright House, she's like, yeah, you're the guy who's calling about InfoWars being blocked from your computer.
[00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:38.569]  I'm like, yeah, I guess.
[00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.790]  Let me transfer you.
[00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:45.473]  So she transfers me to the vice president, I guess, the regional division for Roadrunner here in town.
[00:42:46.074 --> 00:42:47.675]  He gets on the phone, knows who I am.
[00:42:47.695 --> 00:42:49.876]  He's like, yeah, InfoWars.com is back up.
[00:42:49.896 --> 00:42:51.197]  About an hour ago, we put it back up.
[00:42:52.217 --> 00:42:54.999]  And he went off saying that he would have resigned from his job.
[00:42:55.686 --> 00:43:03.892]  If this were to ever happen again, and the point I'm trying to make is that I think this whole plan that Time Warner did to censor you backfired in their face.
[00:43:04.553 --> 00:43:11.738]  I think that the truth will prevail and I think that this actually gave you more publicity because now the Vice President here locally is going to check out your website.
[00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:13.880]  He even told me he would watch your documentaries.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.461]  Well let me ask you a question.
[00:43:17.103 --> 00:43:17.423]  What's that?
[00:43:17.443 --> 00:43:22.387]  Because I need to, I told you we put this to bed and so let me just tell you something first.
[00:43:23.636 --> 00:43:43.074]  Okay, there was a massive internet outage because Level 3, one of the big peer companies, and another one of their peers, was having a war between each other and so it shut down about 25% of the net's customers to going to many websites.
[00:43:44.696 --> 00:43:55.198]  To be specific, there's another problem Roadrunner's been engaging in for months and months and months, and no one else does it, and that is erasing our DNS numbers.
[00:43:55.618 --> 00:44:09.980]  That was going on simultaneously at the same time, and that's why people that were with Level 3 or Cogent, they could still get to our websites, but people with Time Warner couldn't because it was a double whammy.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.401]  But you're saying that he admitted that, quote, they put it back up there.
[00:44:13.999 --> 00:44:25.752]  Well, he told me basically that it's back up now and if they were to ever filter anything, Roadrunner, you know, if he had personal, I guess, if they asked me to filter anything, I would resign from my job.
[00:44:25.772 --> 00:44:26.412]  Well, that's good.
[00:44:26.773 --> 00:44:27.213]  I commend him.
[00:44:27.253 --> 00:44:30.877]  Thanks for the call and I appreciate you calling and trying to help with that.
[00:44:33.916 --> 00:44:35.677]  I think Roadrunner is a good service.
[00:44:35.717 --> 00:44:36.717]  I've had DSL.
[00:44:37.298 --> 00:44:39.698]  It's not good, at least in my experience.
[00:44:39.879 --> 00:44:43.560]  In some areas of the country, in some services I'm told, it's better.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.141]  But cable modems are great.
[00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:49.302]  By and large, I'm not going to sit here and bash them.
[00:44:50.223 --> 00:44:53.244]  It's just that they continually erase our DNS number.
[00:44:55.245 --> 00:44:59.887]  I'm not a technical expert or even a novice, but I'm not going to bore you with all of this.
[00:45:01.664 --> 00:45:02.645]  It's a double whammy.
[00:45:02.745 --> 00:45:07.428]  There was a deliberate war between two backbone companies.
[00:45:08.489 --> 00:45:13.112]  Level 3 shut off access to one of their other customers.
[00:45:14.693 --> 00:45:15.934]  The customer is even the right word.
[00:45:15.954 --> 00:45:16.855]  One of the other tiers.
[00:45:17.855 --> 00:45:19.777]  And then they shut off access to Level 3.
[00:45:22.944 --> 00:45:31.906]  At the same time, though, Time Warner did what they've done literally 50 times before, but usually only for 12 hours or so.
[00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:34.467]  They erased our DNS number out of there.
[00:45:34.767 --> 00:45:41.409]  And people say, well Alex, you should be on, you know, co-located or, you know, multiple server systems around the country.
[00:45:41.649 --> 00:45:42.349]  We've done that.
[00:45:43.269 --> 00:45:44.390]  And it's too expensive.
[00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:48.211]  When you're using 6 plus terabytes, yeah, that's right folks.
[00:45:48.651 --> 00:45:49.891]  More than the Drudge Report uses.
[00:45:50.752 --> 00:45:53.674]  He gets a lot more visitors than we do, but he's not media-intensive.
[00:45:54.314 --> 00:46:01.979]  So when you start using six terabytes a month or more, I mean, it's just... I don't want to... Again, it's technical.
[00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:03.019]  Mumbo-jumbo.
[00:46:03.039 --> 00:46:04.220]  We've got a lot of news to cover.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.062]  I appreciate all your support with the Time Warner thing, but now that's blown over.
[00:46:08.482 --> 00:46:09.343]  So thank you so much.
[00:46:09.863 --> 00:46:12.425]  Okay, I'll never get to all these calls.
[00:46:13.405 --> 00:46:17.287]  Every day I want to move through callers quickly, but I'm so long-winded it's just never going to happen.
[00:46:18.268 --> 00:46:19.689]  I'm trying my best here, folks.
[00:46:20.599 --> 00:46:23.680]  Uh, Chris, in New Mexico, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.541]  Good morning, Alex, you evil Christian homeschooling terrorist, you.
[00:46:28.821 --> 00:46:33.522]  Hey, uh, by any chance were you or Violet listening to WOAI Radio last night?
[00:46:34.463 --> 00:46:35.423]  No, I didn't.
[00:46:36.003 --> 00:46:38.704]  Oh, you should have heard the whining and moaning and squealing.
[00:46:38.724 --> 00:46:44.825]  Remember a year ago you were talking about the Trans-Texas Corridor and all the toll roads and all that stuff?
[00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:47.146]  Well, apparently it's gonna hit San Antonio.
[00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:51.526]  And now there's a website called the TexasTollParty.com or .org
[00:46:55.237 --> 00:46:58.119]  And, oh, they're whining big time in San Antonio.
[00:46:58.179 --> 00:46:59.520]  And I felt like calling this guy up.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.282]  His name is Ben Ferguson, I think his name is.
[00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:05.765]  Look, they put the radio readers in seven years ago.
[00:47:06.205 --> 00:47:06.365]  Really?
[00:47:06.385 --> 00:47:09.107]  That's how, oh yeah, that's how advanced all this is.
[00:47:09.528 --> 00:47:17.894]  And every major road will have large sections of it without toll booths, folks, where it transponds and charges you and tracks everywhere you go.
[00:47:17.994 --> 00:47:19.195]  And it'll be used for ticketing.
[00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:22.758]  Well, I felt like calling this guy up and saying, hey, have you ever heard of Alex Jones?
[00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.900]  He was talking about this, you know, ages ago, a year ago.
[00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:34.586]  And, um, I mean, the only word that I did not hear come up in the conversation last night, because they were talking about all these corporations and government and all this stuff.
[00:47:35.027 --> 00:47:35.967]  It's like, hello?
[00:47:36.668 --> 00:47:38.249]  Have you ever heard of the word fascism?
[00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:39.190]  You know?
[00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:44.954]  Well, by the way, this company, this company that is literally going to be given the roads of Texas, 6,000 miles,
[00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.833]  And the entire country has 7,000 miles of toll roads right now.
[00:47:49.913 --> 00:47:54.897]  Texas will have 6,000 more miles on top of what we're going to get.
[00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:58.360]  2,000 in the cities, 4,000 outside the cities.
[00:47:59.101 --> 00:48:02.484]  And it is a foreign EU company.
[00:48:02.544 --> 00:48:09.370]  It's a German-Dutch consortium that will literally own the roads, control, they'll have a lease
[00:48:10.535 --> 00:48:13.216]  That's what they were talking about last time.
[00:48:41.238 --> 00:48:43.940]  But you notice that, you know why they're doing it in Texas?
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.481]  They put in the electronic voting machines.
[00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:46.481]  There's not much we can do.
[00:48:47.162 --> 00:48:58.708]  All we can do, well yeah, we don't really have voting in most cities now, what we need to do is have paper ballot recalls of the voting machines themselves.
[00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:07.093]  That's why they'll have a poll in Houston, 98% of it against it, and the politician goes, I don't care, we're doing it, vote me out, and then the mayor actually laughs at people.
[00:49:07.374 --> 00:49:09.615]  It's like Mayor Will Wynne, he actually laughs at Austin.
[00:49:10.689 --> 00:49:12.290]  Now, they didn't used to do that.
[00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.450]  Why do they laugh now?
[00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.871]  Because we know for a fact that our InterCivics machines are a complete fraud.
[00:49:19.072 --> 00:49:19.772]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:20.352 --> 00:49:21.873]  So they were pulling their hair out, huh?
[00:49:22.393 --> 00:49:28.795]  But I bet they didn't mention the fact that it'll track you where you go and give you tickets from point to point of your speed.
[00:49:28.855 --> 00:49:31.376]  I bet they only mentioned the thousands of dollars in charges.
[00:49:31.496 --> 00:49:32.176]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:32.356 --> 00:49:40.119]  I mean, they're completely oblivious and unaware of the fact that they're going to be tracked, traced, ticketed, you know, just like you said a year ago.
[00:49:40.675 --> 00:49:48.259]  You know, I've got a notebook here full of stuff that I've written down over the last year, things that you've said.
[00:49:48.339 --> 00:49:50.621]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:54.103]  I look back at this list and go, oh my God, everything you've said is coming true.
[00:49:55.343 --> 00:49:55.964]  It's unreal.
[00:49:56.424 --> 00:49:57.825]  Well, let me tell you, it's not hard to do.
[00:49:57.845 --> 00:50:00.746]  I don't have a crystal ball or a Ouija board here.
[00:50:01.107 --> 00:50:03.328]  Listen, before we get to the break, let me share one more with you.
[00:50:03.348 --> 00:50:05.269]  The New Mexico State Police has been running this
[00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.992]  Uh, commercial here in New Mexico.
[00:50:08.532 --> 00:50:11.735]  Uh, they have a program called, listen to this, Tag Your Tie.
[00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:12.676]  Okay?
[00:50:13.036 --> 00:50:17.640]  They're talking about digital photos, DNA samples, wristbands and all that.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:29.910]  And I thought, you know, the first time I saw that, my jaw hit the floor and it's like, well, why don't you just, you know, either stick a, uh, mention the fact that you're going to stick a chip in the kid's arm, or hey, better yet, why don't you just stick a tag on the kid's ear and, you know,
[00:50:30.959 --> 00:50:32.320]  Teach them to go back!
[00:50:34.021 --> 00:50:39.344]  You know that's a national program and Tommy Thompson is doing a 50 state tour in the next year.
[00:50:39.364 --> 00:50:40.484]  He'll be coming to your state.
[00:50:40.524 --> 00:50:42.766]  He'll be on the news saying every child needs a chip.
[00:50:43.066 --> 00:50:44.046]  It's getting scary.
[00:50:44.847 --> 00:50:47.868]  But you have to understand, we're the weirdos because we don't want chips.
[00:50:49.169 --> 00:50:54.212]  We're enabling, remember Andy Rooney said it, by not taking chips we enable Al Qaeda.
[00:50:54.932 --> 00:50:56.553]  We need to take a chip to prove we're good.
[00:50:56.593 --> 00:50:57.534]  Good points Chris, thank you.
[00:51:01.408 --> 00:51:04.249]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.090]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:11.093]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:11.453 --> 00:51:18.176]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:18.516 --> 00:51:20.497]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:20.697 --> 00:51:23.537]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:23.637 --> 00:51:28.299]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:28.499 --> 00:51:32.900]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:40.362]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:40.622 --> 00:51:43.042]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:43.203 --> 00:51:44.923]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:51:45.623 --> 00:51:51.085]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[00:52:00.416 --> 00:52:07.938]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.198 --> 00:52:19.101]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:19.381 --> 00:52:21.183]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:21.463 --> 00:52:24.765]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.106 --> 00:52:35.554]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:35.854 --> 00:52:36.355]  That's right!
[00:52:36.535 --> 00:52:43.662]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:43.942 --> 00:52:48.066]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:48.246 --> 00:52:52.691]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:59.972 --> 00:54:04.616]  We've got Jim Tucker coming up in about 10 minutes.
[00:54:04.636 --> 00:54:07.438]  We'll take calls in this segment and take some more in the next little segment.
[00:54:08.259 --> 00:54:09.100]  Continue with the news.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:15.745]  I haven't even gotten into all the fake subway alerts and open discussions in the New York Times of Lord Rove being indicted now.
[00:54:15.765 --> 00:54:20.349]  The toll free number to join us of course is 800-259-9231.
[00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:20.650]  Coming up this
[00:54:25.569 --> 00:54:32.612]  This Sunday, downtown Austin, Colorado Street, 7 o'clock, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, movie theater, food, drinks, everything.
[00:54:34.413 --> 00:54:36.514]  Eight bucks at the door.
[00:54:36.734 --> 00:54:37.494]  It's a great place.
[00:54:37.514 --> 00:54:41.036]  You can also buy the tickets online by linking through at Infowars.com.
[00:54:41.496 --> 00:54:44.377]  And it is, last time I checked, almost sold out.
[00:54:45.258 --> 00:54:46.658]  That Sunday showing.
[00:54:46.678 --> 00:54:48.339]  There are some tickets left.
[00:54:48.939 --> 00:54:57.244]  I think they're about 70% sold for the Monday night at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[00:54:58.525 --> 00:54:59.666]  And that'll be at 7 o'clock.
[00:54:59.766 --> 00:55:03.808]  And I'm going to show my new film, The Order of Death.
[00:55:03.828 --> 00:55:06.510]  35... I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.171]  I'm already trying to add more to it.
[00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:09.892]  I just can't keep my hands off of it.
[00:55:10.613 --> 00:55:14.195]  The Order of Death, which really gets into the secret societies that control things.
[00:55:14.655 --> 00:55:17.277]  Back into the Babylon and Egyptian mystery religions.
[00:55:18.197 --> 00:55:20.298]  How it ties in to Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:25.959]  New footage we got from a courageous gentleman that we call Kyle who snuck in there this year while he was an employee.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.581]  Amazing new footage inside the owl up close of the effigy.
[00:55:31.221 --> 00:55:33.141]  Just incredible stuff never before seen.
[00:55:33.461 --> 00:55:39.983]  That's in the order of death and that's 35 minutes and then we've cut the original Bohemian Grove film down from 125 minutes to about 105 minutes.
[00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:50.245]  And cut out some stuff, made it a little bit shorter, remastered it digitally.
[00:55:50.565 --> 00:55:52.686]  Better audio, better video, crisper.
[00:55:54.427 --> 00:56:00.831]  We have better computers now to sit there and blow up the ritual because I was at a distance from it.
[00:56:00.851 --> 00:56:03.552]  It's better color correction, just basic stuff like that.
[00:56:03.572 --> 00:56:05.934]  You'll be able to come see that this Sunday and this Monday.
[00:56:05.954 --> 00:56:06.894]  And then that's it, folks.
[00:56:07.535 --> 00:56:10.917]  I'm sure because they're already selling out the theater, they'll ask me to have more showings.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:18.904]  You never know, I might have one where I'm not there, but I just am too busy trying to make another film and radio interviews and fight the New World Order.
[00:56:19.384 --> 00:56:20.885]  So please come out to these two events.
[00:56:20.965 --> 00:56:23.566]  I always love the folks that come out and I appreciate your support.
[00:56:25.007 --> 00:56:26.308]  It's always great to see it.
[00:56:26.328 --> 00:56:30.550]  I'll have all my other books and videos and other titles that we carry there at the table as well.
[00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:35.573]  If you want a signature, which people want, I don't know why you want it, I'll be glad to give it to you.
[00:56:36.754 --> 00:56:37.854]  What do they call those autographs?
[00:56:38.435 --> 00:56:40.756]  But I want your autograph though, as somebody that
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.042]  Came out and cares about fighting the New World Order and is involved.
[00:56:44.963 --> 00:56:47.325]  Again, this is not about the personality of Alex Jones.
[00:56:48.186 --> 00:56:52.790]  At the same time, I'm not going to offer the original Bohemian Grove that's only on VHS.
[00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:55.492]  It's going to come out now on DVD and VHS.
[00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:59.235]  I'm not going to offer it anymore.
[00:56:59.255 --> 00:57:04.780]  The original Bohemian Grove that we've been offering for four, almost five years, you're not going to be able to get it anymore.
[00:57:06.363 --> 00:57:13.288]  And we are signing all of the orders that we get right up until we stop offering it in about 3 or 4 weeks.
[00:57:14.068 --> 00:57:18.251]  So if you want this collector's item, you need to call toll free to get it.
[00:57:18.592 --> 00:57:20.333]  Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:20.593 --> 00:57:22.094]  The 2 plus hour original.
[00:57:22.114 --> 00:57:22.815]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:23.075]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.341]  Of course, presentplanet.tv members will always be able to watch it.
[00:57:38.361 --> 00:57:44.882]  We're going to leave the original up on the web there, plus add the new one and the Order of Death in the next week.
[00:57:45.123 --> 00:57:52.845]  You'll have a few weeks as presentplanet.tv members where nobody else is able to get it, where the DVD isn't even mass-produced yet.
[00:57:53.105 --> 00:57:54.165]  That's going to happen next week.
[00:57:54.865 --> 00:57:58.508]  You'll have time to, as members, to have that first.
[00:57:59.048 --> 00:58:01.470]  They're at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:06.253]  That is the Order of Death and the remastered Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:58:07.754 --> 00:58:11.717]  But the very first people who will get to see it are coming up this Sunday and this Monday.
[00:58:13.278 --> 00:58:19.783]  You can also go to InfoWars.com and order the original Bohemian Grove VR Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart right now.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:24.281]  Call toll free to get it, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:25.521 --> 00:58:28.221]  Take advantage of this.
[00:58:29.242 --> 00:58:35.203]  Get the original, which I guarantee will be a collector's edition, the signed ones, in a very limited number.
[00:58:35.723 --> 00:58:37.263]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:39.784 --> 00:58:44.364]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:56.690]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:58.431]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.132 --> 00:59:00.292]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.913 --> 00:59:01.733]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.474 --> 00:59:03.994]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.034 --> 00:59:08.037]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.217 --> 00:59:12.359]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:23.025]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, we're here live defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[00:59:23.749 --> 00:59:26.131]  Boycotting the New World Order and its activities.
[00:59:27.792 --> 00:59:28.973]  We're going to take some more calls.
[00:59:29.073 --> 00:59:35.357]  Jim Tucker will be joining us coming up in the next segment to talk about his new incredible book that is so good we're carrying it.
[00:59:35.957 --> 00:59:38.159]  I've got it right here in my hot little hands.
[00:59:38.259 --> 00:59:40.340]  It's Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[00:59:40.801 --> 00:59:44.603]  Over a quarter century of investigating the global elite and infiltrating them.
[00:59:44.663 --> 00:59:46.144]  It's just amazing.
[00:59:46.164 --> 00:59:48.245]  If you want real history, this will give it to you.
[00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:51.708]  And that's available via InfoWars.com right now.
[00:59:52.945 --> 00:59:55.588]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:59:55.628 --> 00:59:57.910]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:58.590]  John, go ahead.
[00:59:58.931 --> 00:59:59.391]  Hello, Alex.
[00:59:59.411 --> 01:00:01.573]  I have about four or five things I want to hit really quickly.
[01:00:02.274 --> 01:00:14.345]  The first is I heard back in May 2005 on NPR report that in Geneva many of the nations of the world voted to turn over a lot of the sovereignty to the World Health Organization.
[01:00:15.303 --> 01:00:19.625]  And we're, by the way, turning over control of the internet to the EU right now and the UN.
[01:00:19.725 --> 01:00:20.626]  It's horrible.
[01:00:21.046 --> 01:00:21.706]  Right, right.
[01:00:21.726 --> 01:00:28.149]  And so when they were doing all this quarantining over SARS and stuff, they actually didn't have, the World Health Organization didn't have any power at the time.
[01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:31.511]  But now that the census votes actually do have that power.
[01:00:32.251 --> 01:00:33.371]  I have a clip on that.
[01:00:33.492 --> 01:00:38.334]  Also, this past weekend on the Motley Fool radio show, it's an investment show on NPR.
[01:00:39.318 --> 01:00:46.841]  They were talking about why it's a contingent technology and how it's only going to be for the elite in places like Thailand or Singapore or something.
[01:00:46.861 --> 01:00:52.004]  And when I saw that on 9-11 Road to Tyrney, I thought, I'll be honest, I thought that was a bunk.
[01:00:52.104 --> 01:00:56.806]  But here it is, they're talking about it on mainstream news that's kind of especially coming out in Friday.
[01:00:56.846 --> 01:00:57.787]  Well, you know, I don't get it.
[01:00:57.807 --> 01:01:00.648]  I mean, listen, I just want you to check out what I claim.
[01:01:01.188 --> 01:01:05.130]  You know, like a caller before you couldn't believe that they're on
[01:01:05.942 --> 01:01:11.585]  The radio announcing transponders for all the cars and thousands of dollars in tolls on major roads.
[01:01:12.225 --> 01:01:16.307]  I mean, look, that listener is obviously a great guy and very intelligent, but he's only been listening a year.
[01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:18.728]  I was talking about it nine years ago.
[01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:20.989]  Not because I'm a genius.
[01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.751]  It was in trade publications.
[01:01:23.951 --> 01:01:25.932]  Everything is in the trades.
[01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:32.096]  Because that's where people in industries, CEOs and managers get their information.
[01:01:32.136 --> 01:01:34.278]  And that's what I sit up at 3 in the morning reading.
[01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:38.481]  And then I get up here on air and freak out and I'm not very professional about presenting it.
[01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:44.285]  Sometimes I think I ought to be just real dry and mechanically, you know, deliver all of this.
[01:01:44.345 --> 01:01:46.146]  But frankly, I am who I am.
[01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:47.447]  I'm freaking out over this.
[01:01:47.867 --> 01:01:50.609]  I mean, we're talking about a hell world.
[01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.431]  And sir, they already have life extension.
[01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:54.232]  You can already live to be 140 easy.
[01:01:56.697 --> 01:01:59.318]  If you get on Life Extension when you're 50 or 60 years old.
[01:01:59.638 --> 01:02:07.802]  The problem is these people are trying to get on it when they're already 85 and then they've already degraded so much or 90 years old that it only lets them live to be maybe 110.
[01:02:08.582 --> 01:02:12.523]  Also we know from internal sources some of the elite have already staged their deaths.
[01:02:12.844 --> 01:02:17.966]  When they get to 98 it gets pretty obvious and so they're getting skin grafts, new faces, everything.
[01:02:18.406 --> 01:02:19.426]  Sure, it's 2005 brother.
[01:02:19.446 --> 01:02:19.746]  Okay, I've got
[01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:28.067]  Just put this to you this way, I know people very close to me who work in secret defense department programs in cybernetics.
[01:02:28.608 --> 01:02:32.331]  And just believe me my friend, people can live a long time.
[01:02:32.651 --> 01:02:35.113]  I'm not even going to say if they're really the same person they were though.
[01:02:35.614 --> 01:02:37.075]  Brain grafts, everything else.
[01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:43.080]  Yeah, but a lot of the stuff like you said is just starting to come out to the open now and it's just kind of going over people's heads.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.302]  Well, I mean, they're cloning babies now.
[01:02:46.602 --> 01:02:46.842]  Yeah.
[01:02:47.123 --> 01:02:52.448]  I mean, they're allowed to bring babies to term and use them in tanks for body parts in New Jersey.
[01:02:52.808 --> 01:02:56.752]  I mean, that's mainstream news and nobody knows about it.
[01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:56.912]  Right.
[01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.473]  I mean, I'm sorry they're doing it.
[01:02:58.513 --> 01:02:59.294]  I'm sorry, Tommy.
[01:02:59.314 --> 01:03:03.618]  Look, again, Tommy Thompson is traveling the country saying every child needs a chip.
[01:03:03.979 --> 01:03:05.300]  I mean, that's Twilight Zone right there.
[01:03:06.423 --> 01:03:07.523]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:03:07.624 --> 01:03:10.205]  The Mexican Attorney General tells his employees you gotta take chips.
[01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:14.266]  I mean, I got Andy Rooney on tape saying we need chips to prove who the good people are.
[01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:15.427]  Yeah.
[01:03:15.627 --> 01:03:18.028]  Look, they're gonna nuke cities and make us all take chips.
[01:03:18.368 --> 01:03:21.209]  Can you imagine the police state they'll get out of a city being vaporized?
[01:03:21.749 --> 01:03:23.130]  We saw what happened after New Orleans.
[01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:26.031]  We saw what happened after 9-11.
[01:03:26.211 --> 01:03:27.211]  Right, right.
[01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:28.012]  One more quick thing.
[01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:28.432]  Sure.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:34.001]  If your listeners are having trouble getting to your website because of a internet filter, there's a website.
[01:03:34.121 --> 01:03:38.502]  It's guardster.com and it lets you get through internet filters.
[01:03:38.923 --> 01:03:40.423]  It's a proxy server and it's free.
[01:03:41.043 --> 01:03:42.543]  Well, send me an email about that.
[01:03:42.563 --> 01:03:44.184]  We might want to put a linky up to them.
[01:03:44.204 --> 01:03:45.024]  Okay, I'll send that to you.
[01:03:45.304 --> 01:03:45.984]  Great call.
[01:03:46.044 --> 01:03:46.884]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:46.904 --> 01:03:48.745]  We'll be right back with Big Jim Tucker.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:04:00.010]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:05.016]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:05.256 --> 01:04:10.904]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:15.649]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:15.869 --> 01:04:23.037]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:23.057 --> 01:04:23.837]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:04:23.878 --> 01:04:26.200]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother, total information awareness.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:26.941]  We're good to go.
[01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:53.191]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:53.571 --> 01:04:59.312]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:04:59.572 --> 01:05:04.694]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:14.317]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:19.620]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.943]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:24.163 --> 01:05:28.906]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:35.210]  Emergency Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:41.758]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:41.798 --> 01:05:42.779]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:44.101]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.044 --> 01:05:58.371]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:05:58.692 --> 01:06:03.979]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:06:04.379 --> 01:06:07.343]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:08.424]  We're good to go.

[01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:59.077]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:59.698 --> 01:07:02.721]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.445 --> 01:07:15.852]  Well, we've always enjoyed having Jim Tucker on over the last 10 years, and we may have gotten our time zones screwed up, or we set this up a week ago, Jim,
[01:07:18.103 --> 01:07:18.503]  You never know.
[01:07:18.563 --> 01:07:19.584]  Might be under the weather or something.
[01:07:19.904 --> 01:07:22.286]  Right now we are trying to get connected to him.
[01:07:22.326 --> 01:07:23.846]  We're hitting his voicemail.
[01:07:24.367 --> 01:07:26.388]  But normally when this happens we end up connecting.
[01:07:26.408 --> 01:07:29.550]  We're going to call American Free Press in D.C.
[01:07:31.171 --> 01:07:34.953]  and try to find out where Jim is at with that.
[01:07:35.193 --> 01:07:36.774]  He may think he's coming on the next hour.
[01:07:37.255 --> 01:07:40.196]  We tend, ourselves, quite a lot to get the time zones mixed up.
[01:07:40.216 --> 01:07:45.860]  We're going to continue with your phone calls right now and then I want to get into
[01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:50.574]  New York Times, Washington Post, hey, Karl Rove may be indicted.
[01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.437]  He's being called to testify again on the heels of that.
[01:07:53.837 --> 01:08:05.349]  More terror alerts, and Bush is running around talking about how the evil terrorists want to attack our freedom, and then you track back to the terrorist star, their LCI Ada, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:08:06.733 --> 01:08:10.855]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray, and Ray is calling us from Canada.
[01:08:10.895 --> 01:08:11.495]  Go ahead, Ray.
[01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:12.736]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[01:08:12.796 --> 01:08:18.919]  Okay, I would like to ask you, I know this morning I was listening to the Power Hour, which is on GCN Network.
[01:08:19.579 --> 01:08:20.900]  Yes, that's this network, uh-huh.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:21.280]  Yeah, okay.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:26.323]  Now, they had the controversial author, Dr. Fred Bell.
[01:08:26.343 --> 01:08:27.543]  You heard about him, right?
[01:08:28.183 --> 01:08:28.884]  A little bit, yeah.
[01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:31.325]  Okay, Undercover City Case, whatever have you.
[01:08:32.293 --> 01:08:38.376]  Now, close to 10 o'clock, there was a guy who called and he said he was at this Air Force base.
[01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:42.499]  He did some kind of, I don't know, black ops stuff.
[01:08:42.859 --> 01:08:45.960]  And he mentioned the group doing that was called the BERG.
[01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:47.661]  B-E-R-G.
[01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.303]  And the host specifically asked him, you mean Build-A-Berg?
[01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:51.543]  He said, no, the BERG.
[01:08:52.144 --> 01:08:54.705]  Well, I mean, I can't really go off on what a caller says.
[01:08:54.725 --> 01:08:59.047]  No, I know, but apparently... I mean, somebody calls in, I can call in and say it's the Froot Loops running it all.
[01:08:59.067 --> 01:09:01.709]  No, but apparently... Okay, now what I wanted to ask you... Yeah.
[01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:06.773]  I know you've been on, uh, I think you had on your show Catherine Albrecht.
[01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:10.196]  Yeah, her book's getting a lot of attention, Spice Girls.
[01:09:10.236 --> 01:09:12.457]  Her new book, will you be having her again?
[01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:17.801]  Because she was on the Rents last night and she said something very interesting, which I didn't know.
[01:09:18.777 --> 01:09:21.818]  And really, Mr. Rance was blown out by that, you know.
[01:09:22.178 --> 01:09:30.521]  He said they want to put, like in the Walmart, some kind of, with the RFID chips there, frequency, which will be similar to the cell phone.
[01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:34.063]  So every time you go there, you'll be bombarded by the frequency of the cell phone.
[01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:45.747]  But she said, furthermore, the spy chips they want to put inside the people will be affected by a, what do you call, electromagnetic pulse.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:51.041]  And these, and they did some experiment, and these electromagnets... No, they, uh, they pop.
[01:09:51.261 --> 01:10:00.123]  Okay, now these pop, and these said, everybody whose chip a person can come and blow these chips inside the people and kill them.
[01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:07.405]  So let's say you have 10,000 people who have this chip, a hacker comes in, saying they're all CEO, and bang, you have 10,000 people who are dead.
[01:10:07.445 --> 01:10:08.665]  Yeah, thanks, thanks for your call.
[01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:16.962]  You know, I have interviewed Catherine many, many times over the last, I don't know, I've been interviewing her about four years since she started.
[01:10:18.783 --> 01:10:27.547]  And I haven't read her book, and I'm glad it's getting a lot of attention, but Wired Magazine is all dumbfounded, and they go, she claims there's a conspiracy.
[01:10:28.007 --> 01:10:31.209]  She claims there's a plan to track her every movement with each.
[01:10:31.849 --> 01:10:33.170]  But she doesn't claim anything.
[01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:39.373]  The industry publications, five years ago, folks,
[01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:47.757]  Tex Mars wrote a book in 95, published it in early 96, called Project Lucid.
[01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:48.578]  We carry it.
[01:10:48.598 --> 01:10:49.999]  1996, nine years ago.
[01:10:53.996 --> 01:11:05.465]  Where tiny RFID chips will be in all products, tracked and traced, by cell phone towers, and you will be taxed with them, and everything you do will be uploaded to the internet, to a grand database.
[01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:16.213]  And things like Google will be able to search everything you've done, everything you'll ever, you know, your whole history, but that'll be private indexes that only the government and corporations can have contact with.
[01:11:18.594 --> 01:11:21.817]  So, so, I'm not poo-pooing Katherine Albrecht, she's done a great job.
[01:11:22.515 --> 01:11:28.377]  But, I mean, I remember having her on three years ago, and I was telling her all these horrors, and she couldn't even fathom the full horror of it.
[01:11:28.398 --> 01:11:33.960]  And I know now, last time I had her on, she was going, you know, she was a lot more, what you'd call, radical.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.581]  She was, uh, getting it.
[01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:37.341]  She, you know, getting the full picture.
[01:11:38.022 --> 01:11:42.263]  But, the industries brag.
[01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:46.225]  In 1992, there was big, you know, front page USA Today articles.
[01:11:46.705 --> 01:11:50.767]  And it said, Walmart and the Defense Department have ordered all of their manufacturers
[01:11:51.497 --> 01:12:03.660]  By 2005, all of their suppliers to have RFID chips in their products, in every individual product, not in the pallets, not in the trucks, every single item.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:11.301]  And everything from Michelin tires to Gillette razors to Campbell Soup tried to comply.
[01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:15.102]  But it was too expensive, people boycotted them, we said no.
[01:12:16.221 --> 01:12:30.402]  But the industry's own meetings, their own documents show it being manufactured, it going on the truck to the warehouse, the distribution center, to the Walmart, to your home, into your trash, to the landfill.
[01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:40.943]  And wireless readers constantly scanning and reading, just like they do cookies where you go on the net, scanning everything in your trash can, scanning everything as it leaves.
[01:12:41.404 --> 01:12:41.984]  It's instant.
[01:12:42.384 --> 01:12:58.316]  Already, I mean, two years ago, they had Safeways in upstate California, in northern California, where there's a RFID reader, or a tracker reader, up in the front of the shopping cart.
[01:13:00.177 --> 01:13:05.419]  And as you push it around the store, uh, it just automatically scans everything you throw in there.
[01:13:05.939 --> 01:13:07.899]  I mean, they already have these in many areas of the country.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:15.101]  So, I mean, I gotta toot the horn of, uh, who really talked about it first.
[01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:20.143]  I mean, I remember reading Project Lucent in the mid-1990s, and man, this is some wild stuff.
[01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:28.105]  You know, thumb scanning, total control grids, RFID chips, but I mean, Professor Mars has got a couple of degrees, and he was an officer in the Air Force,
[01:13:29.063 --> 01:13:34.568]  He's got a degree in political science, a degree in space aeronautics.
[01:13:34.809 --> 01:13:39.693]  He wrote best-selling books before we ever talked about the New World Order, about robotics.
[01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:43.056]  He wrote the books to pass the military exams.
[01:13:44.438 --> 01:13:46.239]  He actually writes exam textbooks.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.422]  So he's real smart, folks.
[01:13:50.303 --> 01:13:53.486]  He was writing about it way back then, writing about nanotech way back then.
[01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:58.960]  And so the Toot Horns, by the way, we do carry that Project Lucent book.
[01:13:59.621 --> 01:14:00.802]  I would really hope people would get it.
[01:14:00.862 --> 01:14:05.886]  I mean, you read a book from 95, written in 95, published in 96, I mean, give that to somebody.
[01:14:07.187 --> 01:14:14.032]  And absolutely, if you get in a cat scan or MRI,
[01:14:15.725 --> 01:14:18.206]  It can make the chip explode or be pulled out of your body.
[01:14:18.846 --> 01:14:21.407]  Magnetic pulse could cause it to sizzle and pop.
[01:14:21.427 --> 01:14:23.007]  I don't know about killing you.
[01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:27.488]  I mean, it's very small, but it would definitely blow a nice little hole in you.
[01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:33.810]  Blow out a... Because a contained explosion, even if it's tiny, is extremely powerful.
[01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:38.831]  At least on that small area that it hits.
[01:14:39.591 --> 01:14:41.792]  But everything's... Look!
[01:14:42.975 --> 01:14:54.561]  They admit that they almost passed a law in Texas, and a bunch of other states are passing or trying to pass the laws, where every single thing you do in your car will be tracked.
[01:14:55.242 --> 01:15:01.305]  Now, some states want you to take a $50 satellite tracker box that you get when you get your emissions test.
[01:15:01.937 --> 01:15:11.883]  They place this in and all the new cars for the last, what is it, nine years have a plug in the ignition to where your car won't even start if you have one of these if they decide to put it in.
[01:15:12.223 --> 01:15:20.729]  And it interfaces with the newer black boxes in the last six or seven years that then also track how fast you're driving, you know, where you were going at, how fast you stopped.
[01:15:21.829 --> 01:15:22.450]  Things like that.
[01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:25.852]  They want that, but people are really resisting it.
[01:15:26.372 --> 01:15:29.394]  So now they're saying, okay, we'll just use RFID transponders.
[01:15:30.211 --> 01:15:31.452]  And they started this a few years ago.
[01:15:31.492 --> 01:15:40.477]  There was a San Francisco Chronicle article about people that have the toll road tracker boxes, the size of a small pack of matches, in their window.
[01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:49.902]  And they put up radio readers all over the town, not just on the toll roads, but to also track people by their name attached to their number, where they were going, what they were doing.
[01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:53.284]  Well, now in Texas, I mean, that was in the bill.
[01:15:54.309 --> 01:16:11.360]  The instant your insurance goes out, I mean, the day it goes out, it will red flag you, it will send a ping off the radio readers that have already been put up all over the country, and the police will then hone in on you via in-dash cameras, hooked into the cameras, and will hone in and pull you over.
[01:16:12.841 --> 01:16:18.565]  Or they'll set up roadside checkpoints and wave past cars and wait for your cars to come and just pull you out of line.
[01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:19.985]  Okay, that one doesn't have insurance.
[01:16:20.266 --> 01:16:20.746]  This one doesn't.
[01:16:20.766 --> 01:16:23.768]  And you know, it sounds great, but it's total control.
[01:16:24.927 --> 01:16:27.469]  And then they say, oh, we're going to use it to tax you, too.
[01:16:27.829 --> 01:16:41.120]  You go from radio point A to radio point B, you know, in a two-mile stretch, and it shows you were doing 85 miles an hour, we're going to take a digital photo of you, we've got your tracker number, and we're going to instantly fine it out of your bank account.
[01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:44.543]  So you're going to have accounts you load money into.
[01:16:44.883 --> 01:16:46.364]  Or you don't want to load money into it?
[01:16:46.825 --> 01:16:53.511]  It is a serious crime in the bill that we barely defeated to disable or to remove the chip.
[01:16:53.631 --> 01:16:56.233]  And now it's not the size of a cocktail matches.
[01:16:56.934 --> 01:17:02.158]  Now it is about an inch long and a half inch wide and about a tenth of an inch thick.
[01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.240]  It's just like a thick little piece of tape.
[01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:05.773]  Less than a tenth of an inch.
[01:17:05.853 --> 01:17:06.413]  It's in the bill.
[01:17:06.854 --> 01:17:08.654]  And it just goes right there in your dash.
[01:17:08.994 --> 01:17:10.414]  And it's got a transponder in it.
[01:17:10.734 --> 01:17:12.575]  And you drive under those things and they scan it.
[01:17:12.595 --> 01:17:14.795]  Let me tell you something else.
[01:17:15.196 --> 01:17:18.396]  They've already got barcodes in our license plates in most states.
[01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:20.857]  If you look at it in the right light angle, you'll see the barcode.
[01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:24.438]  And I was consulting for a movie that's coming out next March.
[01:17:24.498 --> 01:17:25.618]  I'll tell you about it when it comes out.
[01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:31.900]  But I was consulting for the film and they're going to have barcodes for the license plates.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.520]  And I explained to them, I said,
[01:17:34.306 --> 01:17:35.767]  I said, that's already going on.
[01:17:35.907 --> 01:17:36.207]  Okay.
[01:17:36.887 --> 01:17:38.508]  And so they added something to the film.
[01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.050]  I consulted them on a bunch of issues.
[01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:43.471]  I'm not going to get into it until the movie comes out.
[01:17:44.332 --> 01:17:45.772]  But non-disclosure stuff.
[01:17:45.812 --> 01:17:52.076]  But the point is, is that it's so far advanced, it's mind-blowing.
[01:17:52.978 --> 01:17:57.760]  Okay, they're going to tax you, they're going to trace you, they're going to give you tickets.
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:58.841]  They're going to fine you.
[01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:02.382]  Fining, taxing, tracking, tracing, total control.
[01:18:02.902 --> 01:18:06.364]  Total 1984 Orwellville on steroids.
[01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:08.425]  And they're already doing it in London.
[01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:13.467]  They are past the law to start it last year, incrementally, in Oregon.
[01:18:13.987 --> 01:18:15.848]  Schwarzenegger's trying to get it passed.
[01:18:16.548 --> 01:18:20.249]  Texas is... and by the way, I almost pulled my hair out two weeks ago.
[01:18:22.535 --> 01:18:23.255]  Business Wire.
[01:18:23.936 --> 01:18:24.496]  TxDOT.
[01:18:24.856 --> 01:18:26.097]  That's the Department of Transportation.
[01:18:26.617 --> 01:18:35.682]  Ordered two million of these in their first order, another two million after that, and they're just going to, through different programs, start forcing us to take it without even having the law.
[01:18:36.762 --> 01:18:38.463]  I mean, they don't even have laws, do they?
[01:18:38.623 --> 01:18:46.867]  They just... We've got men that wear uniforms and carry guns and got machine guns in the trunk, and they'll knock your teeth out if we tell them to, because they're dumb as dirt.
[01:18:47.367 --> 01:18:48.588]  Now, shut up, slaves!
[01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:59.243]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:18:59.383 --> 01:19:12.307]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:19:12.487 --> 01:19:14.268]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:19:14.448 --> 01:19:17.929]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:21.991]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:19:22.231 --> 01:19:27.213]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:19:27.473 --> 01:19:29.173]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:19:29.453 --> 01:19:33.395]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:19:33.675 --> 01:19:35.537]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[01:19:35.677 --> 01:19:40.341]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.

[01:20:12.644 --> 01:20:15.287]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:15.627 --> 01:20:19.630]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:20.070]  I think so.
[01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:40.488]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:41.248 --> 01:20:42.750]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:44.791]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:44.931 --> 01:20:45.391]  One and the same.
[01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:47.533]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:21:06.405 --> 01:21:11.886]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:12.306 --> 01:21:15.427]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:15.687 --> 01:21:17.107]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:17.367 --> 01:21:21.027]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:21.288 --> 01:21:23.368]  Here is reality.
[01:21:23.728 --> 01:21:27.309]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:27.789 --> 01:21:31.449]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:32.029 --> 01:21:34.590]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:21:36.204 --> 01:21:39.929]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:41.451]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:56.591]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:21:56.731 --> 01:21:58.472]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:21:58.552 --> 01:21:59.813]  But not just any water.
[01:21:59.893 --> 01:22:04.096]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:22:04.176 --> 01:22:13.862]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:19.789]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:24.574]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[01:22:24.734 --> 01:22:28.679]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[01:22:29.019 --> 01:22:29.179]  Call 1-866-884-9104.
[01:22:54.450 --> 01:23:00.473]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:01.093 --> 01:23:04.074]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.055 --> 01:23:09.977]  Look, this whole grid is going in right now.
[01:23:10.497 --> 01:23:12.678]  They've been building this prison for a long time.
[01:23:13.278 --> 01:23:20.161]  Prison of our minds, a physical prison, multi-layered control systems, and
[01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.143]  Bush will take the blame.
[01:23:22.203 --> 01:23:23.284]  Bush will be the boogeyman.
[01:23:23.324 --> 01:23:27.386]  Bush will be the guy that did it all when he's nothing but a snot-nosed puppet.
[01:23:29.547 --> 01:23:30.768]  Then they'll put a Hillary in.
[01:23:31.108 --> 01:23:32.409]  They'll put a Schwarzenegger in.
[01:23:32.429 --> 01:23:35.311]  They'll put a Roberts in.
[01:23:35.331 --> 01:23:37.112]  They'll put these people in.
[01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:39.974]  They'll put a Rick Perry in.
[01:23:42.376 --> 01:23:43.537]  And they'll take the blame.
[01:23:43.577 --> 01:23:45.177]  I mean, see how ridiculous it is?
[01:23:45.598 --> 01:23:59.183]  Instead of these corporations, these companies, these elites, what they're openly doing to us that isn't good for any of us, whether you're a fireman, or a school teacher, or a cop, or a lawyer, or a doctor, none of this is good!
[01:23:59.964 --> 01:24:02.445]  The elite is in control because they are so ruthless.
[01:24:02.905 --> 01:24:04.886]  And they're getting more ruthless to stay in control.
[01:24:06.443 --> 01:24:10.406]  I mean, it's a fight to get into control at the highest pinnacles of power.
[01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:14.229]  And the most cunning, the most evil, in history, normally get into power.
[01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:22.496]  And even if you have a good leader, or a good group of leaders, but they build a powerful mechanism, it's always seized and abused later.
[01:24:23.677 --> 01:24:32.864]  And we know we have very evil people in control of very powerful, very detailed, very specific, mechanized mechanisms.
[01:24:34.205 --> 01:24:35.827]  And I'm not trying to scare you, I mean,
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:37.260]  This is real!
[01:24:38.961 --> 01:24:40.882]  The President says torture is good.
[01:24:41.222 --> 01:24:41.982]  I'm going to veto it.
[01:24:42.702 --> 01:24:44.463]  He says the border is being wide open or good.
[01:24:44.503 --> 01:24:49.865]  He says trying to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice to make Hillary Clinton look conservative is good.
[01:24:52.806 --> 01:24:55.747]  Having the biggest federal government ever, doubling its growth rate is good.
[01:24:56.387 --> 01:25:00.929]  Appointing gun control judges everywhere and going after the Second Amendment viciously is conservative.
[01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.709]  No it's not!
[01:25:02.691 --> 01:25:08.094]  And again, when Bush is gone, all these Democrats that are upset about Bush, you watch, most of them aren't going to care.
[01:25:10.415 --> 01:25:20.300]  There are a lot of people out there like Kurt Nemo and countless others who you could call liberals in the past who now have just become freedom lovers and have shifted paradigms and see the big picture.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:27.083]  I mean, I see the deprogramming going on of intelligent people that have the minds out there to get out of these orthodoxies.
[01:25:28.726 --> 01:25:30.689]  But all of us have to get out of them now.
[01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:34.415]  I was once in the conservative orthodoxy.
[01:25:36.057 --> 01:25:37.159]  I was once a Republican.
[01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:43.489]  I mean, I was always a radical Republican, but I fully divorced myself from it as a pack of liars and whores.
[01:25:47.213 --> 01:25:49.774]  And what party we vote for then?
[01:25:49.834 --> 01:25:51.295]  We've got to make the party better.
[01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:52.855]  No, they're rotten.
[01:25:52.895 --> 01:25:53.816]  They're totally corrupt.
[01:25:53.836 --> 01:25:55.637]  There's electronic voting machines.
[01:25:56.057 --> 01:26:04.540]  We first have to totally discredit the system and bring the system down and put in a new system, which is the old system of the Constitution.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.321]  That's what the Declaration of Independence says.
[01:26:07.482 --> 01:26:09.743]  This government has to be totally removed.
[01:26:10.263 --> 01:26:11.703]  It's going to be revolutionary.
[01:26:11.784 --> 01:26:12.764]  It's going to be painful.
[01:26:13.533 --> 01:26:16.154]  They're going to pull all sorts of things, but it's terminal.
[01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:18.695]  Either we defeat them, or we lose everything.
[01:26:19.915 --> 01:26:21.096]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:24.397]  I guess John's up next.
[01:26:25.357 --> 01:26:26.178]  John, you're on the air.
[01:26:26.198 --> 01:26:26.998]  Where are you calling us from?
[01:26:27.398 --> 01:26:28.399]  Calling from Boston, Alex.
[01:26:28.419 --> 01:26:29.019]  How are you doing?
[01:26:29.139 --> 01:26:29.539]  Good, sir.
[01:26:29.659 --> 01:26:29.959]  Welcome.
[01:26:30.459 --> 01:26:30.819]  Thank you.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.520]  I have two things I want to bring up.
[01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:39.223]  First one, I want to get your comments on, although we know they're going to be, they say they're going to Newcastle City.
[01:26:41.431 --> 01:26:48.477]  Here in Boston, we've got Mitt Romney pushing for a presidential run in 2008.
[01:26:48.517 --> 01:26:53.962]  Just seeing what he does when there's a terrorist attack somewhere, we get more troops, we get more cops on the subways.
[01:26:54.222 --> 01:26:58.686]  Well, he's only one of two governors that like Bush's martial law plan.
[01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:01.589]  Well, that's the other thing, yeah.
[01:27:01.689 --> 01:27:05.392]  What do you think about the chances for them trying to pull that here and make him look like a hero?
[01:27:06.286 --> 01:27:07.427]  And, uh, put him into office.
[01:27:07.487 --> 01:27:11.388]  Oh, it'll always happen when they've got an agent, and Mitt Romney is an absolute monster.
[01:27:11.909 --> 01:27:12.569]  Oh, he is.
[01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:16.010]  I mean, as far as I know, he's not even from here originally.
[01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:26.015]  Like, Hillary Clinton going to New York, and, um... And notice the Neocon publications, you know, like, Regnery put out worship... worship books on him.
[01:27:26.055 --> 01:27:27.055]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[01:27:27.616 --> 01:27:28.596]  It's like a religion.
[01:27:28.636 --> 01:27:30.157]  It's like he's a saint or something.
[01:27:30.737 --> 01:27:35.179]  I know, I mean, he ran for senator, didn't win, went out to the Olympics, came back and won governor.
[01:27:36.829 --> 01:27:39.791]  So, I mean, just letting everyone know, keep your eye on him.
[01:27:40.632 --> 01:27:42.053]  That's a good possibility right there.
[01:27:43.114 --> 01:27:50.640]  The other thing that I wanted to bring up is, talking to my grandfather who fought in World War II, he was a Boston detective for many years.
[01:27:51.781 --> 01:27:55.184]  He told me a few things about what he saw in World War II.
[01:27:55.944 --> 01:28:04.191]  And one of the things that stunned me the most was, after the battles, when they were occupying, say, Italy and France, that he would witness families
[01:28:05.014 --> 01:28:12.639]  Telling their daughters, pimping out their mothers, whatever they could for a bar of chocolate because they were so poor and they had no food.
[01:28:13.479 --> 01:28:20.184]  And I just want everyone to realize that that can happen here if we're not vigilant and just take the fight for them.
[01:28:20.964 --> 01:28:23.506]  Well, you know, you're making just incredible points.
[01:28:23.566 --> 01:28:24.647]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:28:25.927 --> 01:28:29.470]  Yeah, I think you should give up Folsom Prison Blues for The Man in Black.
[01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:32.531]  We ought to play that.
[01:28:32.551 --> 01:28:33.352]  That's a good idea.
[01:28:33.832 --> 01:28:36.274]  Hey, John, go see if you can download The Man in Black.
[01:28:37.716 --> 01:28:38.677]  Go see if you can find that.
[01:28:38.977 --> 01:28:39.638]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.621]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.102 --> 01:28:45.723]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.624 --> 01:28:49.307]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.324 --> 01:28:55.245]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[01:28:55.385 --> 01:28:57.605]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[01:28:57.966 --> 01:28:59.966]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:02.587]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:05.688]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[01:29:05.868 --> 01:29:07.108]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:12.750]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:17.431]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease, as well as undue emotional stress.
[01:29:17.731 --> 01:29:23.934]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[01:29:24.134 --> 01:29:30.057]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[01:29:30.378 --> 01:29:36.141]  The Un-Medical Miracle Oxygen is a book that will show you safe, easy ways to increase your body's oxygen level.

[01:29:52.009 --> 01:29:53.970]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:54.050 --> 01:30:04.775]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:05.135 --> 01:30:09.657]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:21.062]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:21.662 --> 01:30:28.507]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:28.907 --> 01:30:31.029]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:31.529 --> 01:30:36.513]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:30:36.813 --> 01:30:42.957]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-8000.
[01:30:44.559 --> 01:30:47.343]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:30:48.365 --> 01:30:48.405]  888-803-4438
[01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:56.271]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[01:30:56.471 --> 01:31:00.414]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[01:31:00.694 --> 01:31:07.999]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste bill, is something we all face every day.
[01:31:08.279 --> 01:31:10.200]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:17.285]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long life battery lasts for 10 years.
[01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:20.507]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy tested.
[01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:23.429]  Your Nuke Alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area,
[01:31:23.729 --> 01:31:26.190]  Or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:27.850]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:28.451 --> 01:31:33.412]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nucal Alert today.
[01:31:33.692 --> 01:31:36.873]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[01:31:37.253 --> 01:31:41.755]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[01:31:42.035 --> 01:31:42.255]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:42.275 --> 01:31:43.676]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nucal Alert today.
[01:31:43.696 --> 01:31:43.996]  Nucal Alert.
[01:31:44.076 --> 01:31:45.156]  Isn't your family worth it?
[01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:56.125]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:56.145 --> 01:32:00.048]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:00.428 --> 01:32:11.536]  I'm told that we used to have the Man in Black, one of Johnny Cash's little spoken word pieces, in the computer.
[01:32:11.716 --> 01:32:15.238]  It's not there now, so we'll try to find it and play it for you.
[01:32:15.318 --> 01:32:17.660]  I've meant to play that before, it's never gotten around to it.
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.682]  But we'll go back to your calls.
[01:32:21.454 --> 01:32:23.436]  Here in just a moment, let me get into some more of the news.
[01:32:23.776 --> 01:32:28.620]  Again, Jim Tucker has never stood us up in the scores of times he's been on.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:34.305]  I'm sure we got time zones wrong, or we got something wrong, most assuredly.
[01:32:34.785 --> 01:32:35.546]  Most assuredly!
[01:32:35.566 --> 01:32:37.367]  I've always hated that term, but I've just used it.
[01:32:38.188 --> 01:32:48.156]  Who knows, but we'll be getting Jim Tucker on, maybe even next hour, or definitely sometime next week, because I got his new book, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg
[01:32:50.318 --> 01:32:51.559]  It's just amazing.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.922]  Jim Tucker's Bilderberg diary.
[01:32:54.703 --> 01:32:57.867]  And for over a quarter century he's been covering the Bilderberg group.
[01:32:58.707 --> 01:33:07.618]  For over a quarter century he has been traveling all over Europe and the United States to cover these events and to sneak in.
[01:33:09.481 --> 01:33:12.624]  Get a hold of their secret documents and find out what's coming up the next year.
[01:33:13.104 --> 01:33:16.507]  I mean, he found out they were going to bring down the Berlin Wall the year before they did.
[01:33:16.547 --> 01:33:17.307]  That was staged.
[01:33:17.787 --> 01:33:19.429]  I mean, he published that before it happened.
[01:33:20.069 --> 01:33:24.432]  He said, nope, we're not invading in March of 2002, as the news was saying they would for sure, remember?
[01:33:24.813 --> 01:33:26.814]  No, we're going to invade in March of 2003.
[01:33:26.994 --> 01:33:29.636]  It happened because he had spies in the meeting.
[01:33:31.598 --> 01:33:33.199]  It's just good old-fashioned detective work.
[01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:34.240]  There are
[01:33:36.084 --> 01:33:40.091]  Hundreds of stories like that in this book and that's why it's important.
[01:33:40.131 --> 01:33:48.364]  I mean this is an inside look of the elite and all the intelligence that a man has gathered on them in over a quarter century.
[01:33:49.065 --> 01:33:50.628]  So Jim Tucker's Bilderberg diary
[01:33:51.964 --> 01:34:02.392]  And it's available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:02.412 --> 01:34:08.437]  And you support Jim Tucker and American Free Press and, of course, this broadcast when you get that book.
[01:34:08.877 --> 01:34:12.901]  888-253-3139 or just send $24, plus I think it's what, $4 shipping and handling.
[01:34:12.921 --> 01:34:14.163]  It's a big book.
[01:34:14.183 --> 01:34:15.384]  To 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:34:30.214 --> 01:34:38.956]  And don't forget, I'm not going to be offering my original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove video anymore in about a month.
[01:34:40.096 --> 01:34:40.476]  No more.
[01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:45.457]  You know, we're in the process of taking all my videos over to DVD.
[01:34:46.057 --> 01:34:49.637]  And I know everybody's on DVD now, about 70% of the market.
[01:34:49.797 --> 01:34:51.578]  Still a lot of people don't have DVD players.
[01:34:51.798 --> 01:34:58.199]  There's still more VHS machines out there than DVDs, but DVD obviously is better for many respects.
[01:35:01.542 --> 01:35:02.343]  It just takes time.
[01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:08.848]  I mean, I could easily just burn copies of my old VHS films over to DVD and sell them, but I don't do it like that.
[01:35:08.888 --> 01:35:14.312]  We've got to build menus, we've got to remaster them, we're adding material to each film, and then re-releasing them.
[01:35:15.653 --> 01:35:28.063]  And the first film we're doing that with, and I'm going to do the others over the next, probably take six months, I've made a mini-documentary, really it's 35 minutes long, it's a whole program in and of itself, called The Order of Death.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:41.708]  That gets into all the secret societies, and Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove Connection, and the new footage we got from our source, our mole, our spy, who went into the Bohemian Grove this year as an employee.
[01:35:43.089 --> 01:35:46.831]  That is going to be added on to the original Bohemian Grove film.
[01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:55.596]  But, we've cut the original Bohemian Grove film down from over two hours to an hour and forty-five minutes.
[01:35:55.636 --> 01:35:56.577]  We've cut about twenty
[01:35:57.478 --> 01:35:59.701]  Twenty-three minutes to be precise.
[01:36:00.222 --> 01:36:01.243]  Out of Dark Secrets.
[01:36:01.483 --> 01:36:03.686]  We've trimmed it down, remastered it, done a lot of things.
[01:36:03.726 --> 01:36:10.474]  But if you want the original two-plus hour film, it will not be offered anymore coming up in a month.
[01:36:11.075 --> 01:36:12.297]  And it's only on VHS.
[01:36:12.337 --> 01:36:16.202]  And we're signing every copy that goes out the next month until the very last copy I sell.
[01:36:17.117 --> 01:36:18.397]  And that's still a limited number.
[01:36:19.838 --> 01:36:23.238]  It's $25.95, but if you get two or three more of any of my other videos, it goes down to $19.
[01:36:23.358 --> 01:36:26.259]  It's an $18 discount on the 3-Tape Special.
[01:36:26.559 --> 01:36:27.659]  Be sure to take advantage of that.
[01:36:27.979 --> 01:36:30.000]  The toll-free number, again, to get that video is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:30.640]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:43.388 --> 01:36:51.791]  Alright, let me get into some more of the news and then we will go back to your calls.
[01:36:52.912 --> 01:36:58.574]  Robe to testify again in grand jury's CIA leak probe.
[01:36:59.454 --> 01:37:06.677]  Prosecutors warning that Bush advisor could be indicted suggests new information may have emerged.
[01:37:06.797 --> 01:37:09.919]  Now, this is out of the Washington Post, similar article in the Washington
[01:37:12.014 --> 01:37:22.903]  uh... you know the other big papers of the new york times white house deputy chief of staff is the realty of staff paul rove will again testified to a grand jury
[01:37:24.648 --> 01:37:39.003]  Is in the final stages of investigating whether senior Bush administration officials illegally leaked identity of a covert CIA operative, Valerie Plame, to the media more than two years ago, a source familiar with the arraignment said yesterday.
[01:37:39.624 --> 01:37:45.190]  Special Prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald contacted Rove last week to seek his fourth
[01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:52.938]  Appearance before the Grand Jury, but warned Rove's lawyer that he could not assure that Rove would not be indicted.
[01:37:53.498 --> 01:37:55.680]  That is ultra massive.
[01:37:56.321 --> 01:38:02.667]  According to the source, Rove could appear as early as today when the Grand Jury is next scheduled to meet.
[01:38:03.266 --> 01:38:20.869]  Fitzgerald's request, which comes just weeks before the grand jury's team is set to expire October 28th, suggests that new information has come to light and other witness testimony or other questions remain that Rove needs to address according to lawyers who have been involved in the case.
[01:38:21.409 --> 01:38:32.311]  Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, said in an interview yesterday that Rove has not been notified that he is the target of the investigation and does not fear testifying despite Fitzgerald's warning.
[01:38:32.916 --> 01:38:38.017]  Luskin declined to say whether he knows the topics Fitzgerald wants the question rove about.
[01:38:38.498 --> 01:39:00.924]  Mr. Fitzgerald has affirmed to me that he has made no charging decisions that he believes, charging decisions is an interesting term, that he believes Carl continues to cooperate fully with the investigation, but beyond that, I don't want to comment at all about any communications with Mr. Fitzgerald's office, Luskin said.
[01:39:02.196 --> 01:39:09.159]  A source close to Roe and Bush's chief political advisor and his legal team are now genuinely concerned he could face charges.
[01:39:09.559 --> 01:39:22.064]  But the source said his lawyers are hoping that Fitzgerald's warning of the chance of indictment is simply the move of a conservative, by-the-book prosecutor, wrapping up a high-profile investigation.
[01:39:22.702 --> 01:39:31.527]  Prosecutorial guidelines require prosecutors to warn witnesses before they appear before a grand jury if there is a chance they could face criminal charges.
[01:39:32.068 --> 01:39:48.978]  For the past 22 months, coming up on two years, Fitzgerald has been investigating whether any Bush administration knowingly revealed Flaym's identity in the 03 as retaliation for public criticism of her husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson.
[01:39:49.882 --> 01:39:54.193]  of the government's case for the iraq war on july six wilson continued
[01:39:55.865 --> 01:40:02.990]  and contended in an opinion piece of the administration claims that Iraq was trying to obtain nuclear materials from Niger were false.
[01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:04.771]  They were patently manufactured.
[01:40:05.071 --> 01:40:10.014]  Wilson has been sent to Africa Nation by the CIA to investigate the claims.
[01:40:10.374 --> 01:40:20.141]  Eight days later, on July 14th, claims name and CIA employment appeared in a syndicated column by CIA officer Robert D. Novak.
[01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:22.662]  I'm adding that as a, well, it's not really a joke.
[01:40:22.682 --> 01:40:23.583]  It's pretty much well known.
[01:40:24.213 --> 01:40:38.359]  Rove has testified that he talked with two reporters about Plame in the time period, but only referred to her as Wilson's wife, and never supplied information about her status as an undercover CIA operative, uh, spy chief, folks.
[01:40:38.679 --> 01:40:50.764]  Vice President Lord Cheney, Chief of Staff Lewis Scooter Libby, also testified that he discussed Plame with at least two reporters, but said that he, too, never mentioned her name or covert status, according to lawyers in the case.
[01:40:52.242 --> 01:40:54.063]  And they don't lie, so you can just believe all that.
[01:40:54.083 --> 01:40:58.866]  A couple different things, more than a couple, could be happening here.
[01:41:00.848 --> 01:41:14.517]  This could be real political football behavior, just like we have Ronnie Earl of Austin, Texas, getting two indictments handed down against Pom DeLay of Houston, Sugar Land.
[01:41:18.099 --> 01:41:22.042]  Again, they charge him with something that wasn't even illegal at the time he did it,
[01:41:22.805 --> 01:41:23.605]  Figure that out.
[01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:28.686]  And then they have another grand jury charging with what he should have been charged with to begin with.
[01:41:29.106 --> 01:41:29.686]  Money laundering!
[01:41:29.906 --> 01:41:32.047]  Which he definitely money laundered according to these rules.
[01:41:32.107 --> 01:41:34.507]  But these federal rules are pretty corrupt.
[01:41:34.967 --> 01:41:35.827]  And pretty hard to follow.
[01:41:35.867 --> 01:41:37.328]  I'm no fan of DeLay, folks.
[01:41:37.388 --> 01:41:40.348]  I just don't like government prosecuting people.
[01:41:41.148 --> 01:41:44.089]  Unless they're red-handed and I like it to be done properly.
[01:41:44.469 --> 01:41:50.070]  Because I'm more worried about an out-of-control government violating people's rights than I am about crooks like Tom DeLay.
[01:41:52.333 --> 01:41:54.094]  Clearly he laundered money and clearly broke the law.
[01:41:54.774 --> 01:41:56.816]  But I'm not going to cry if he has to leave office.
[01:41:58.256 --> 01:42:02.599]  It's never a bad thing to have powerful people who are involved in corrupt activities getting in trouble.
[01:42:02.979 --> 01:42:04.260]  But still, it is political.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:05.981]  I mean, Ronnie Earle is political.
[01:42:06.001 --> 01:42:07.041]  He's a yellow dog Democrat.
[01:42:07.722 --> 01:42:08.762]  Let's just be honest about it.
[01:42:08.782 --> 01:42:09.683]  Let's not mince words.
[01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:11.324]  But it is the grand jury that indicted him.
[01:42:11.804 --> 01:42:14.706]  Not Ronnie Earle, but most of these grand juries are rubber stamps.
[01:42:15.609 --> 01:42:24.611]  When they said that a district attorney or county attorney can get a grand jury to call in an indictment for a ham sandwich, that's really true.
[01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:30.712]  Or, you know, the cop openly shoots the person five times in the back for no reason, they'll no bill it.
[01:42:31.152 --> 01:42:33.273]  I mean, these grand juries are really out of control.
[01:42:34.973 --> 01:42:37.333]  Don't forget Oklahoma City with the Hoppy Heidelberg case.
[01:42:37.674 --> 01:42:38.814]  But I'm digressing.
[01:42:41.074 --> 01:42:41.854]  This could be real.
[01:42:41.874 --> 01:42:43.115]  It could be some political activity.
[01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:44.435]  Or,
[01:42:46.542 --> 01:42:55.157]  This could just be where one elite is blackmailing the Bushes and holding the Sword of Damocles above their heads, threatening them to get things out of them.
[01:42:55.518 --> 01:42:57.341]  We know that went on with Bill Clinton.
[01:42:58.383 --> 01:42:58.884]  We know!
[01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:10.691]  That they used what I would call petty issues, because they couldn't attack Clinton on substantive issues of missile secrets, supercomputers, reactors, because it was all Republican companies doing that.
[01:43:11.191 --> 01:43:17.272]  And, you know, Rumsfeld and the rest of them, and Carlisle Group, and then Clinton was just following orders.
[01:43:17.552 --> 01:43:18.712]  I'm not defending Clinton.
[01:43:18.732 --> 01:43:19.572]  He's a horrible creature.
[01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:22.973]  The point is that it's like a Hydra that has multiple heads.
[01:43:23.013 --> 01:43:24.053]  It's the same creature.
[01:43:24.433 --> 01:43:25.454]  It's part of the same body.
[01:43:25.894 --> 01:43:27.534]  So somebody could be blackmailing Bush.
[01:43:28.775 --> 01:43:31.940]  Well, what I tend to lean towards, though I can't prove that.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.424]  That's what my guts and past activities point towards.
[01:43:37.167 --> 01:43:39.730]  Or this guy, and this is what is really dangerous.
[01:43:40.472 --> 01:43:41.273]  This could be real.
[01:43:41.573 --> 01:43:44.117]  This guy could be really doing his job.
[01:43:44.773 --> 01:43:47.794]  But he would have died in a plane crash or a car wreck if that was the case.
[01:43:47.834 --> 01:43:50.195]  I mean, folks, they kill senators right out in the open.
[01:43:50.215 --> 01:43:51.355]  They blow up planes.
[01:43:51.395 --> 01:43:52.816]  They blow up cars.
[01:43:52.896 --> 01:43:56.877]  They shoot people repeatedly, and witnesses see known CIA officers do it.
[01:43:57.217 --> 01:43:57.857]  But they don't care.
[01:43:57.897 --> 01:43:59.898]  They grab some mentally ill person and charge them.
[01:43:59.918 --> 01:44:06.420]  I mean, they could have five guys shooting at Kennedy and tell you it was one guy up in a, you know, book suppository building.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:11.902]  I mean, believe me, folks, I don't think it's the third because this guy would be dead.
[01:44:13.639 --> 01:44:20.343]  Unless somebody close to Bush, unless the elite are manipulating and using him, and that's part two of part three.
[01:44:21.584 --> 01:44:33.651]  But part one of part three is that if this is really about to happen, Bush will set off Nix, the globalists will set off Nix, they will release smallpox, they'll pull something big and bad.
[01:44:34.409 --> 01:44:38.511]  And to smokescreen all of this, and that's maybe why he's going, I need troops!
[01:44:38.651 --> 01:44:39.672]  I need troops in America!
[01:44:40.132 --> 01:44:40.452]  Troops!
[01:44:40.472 --> 01:44:40.793]  Troops!
[01:44:40.853 --> 01:44:41.693]  I got troops!
[01:44:42.093 --> 01:44:43.754]  I'll use troops every week!
[01:44:43.794 --> 01:44:44.675]  Martial Law's good!
[01:44:44.715 --> 01:44:44.915]  Troops!
[01:44:44.955 --> 01:44:45.155]  Troops!
[01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:48.217]  I mean, we're living like in the battle for Rome with Caesar!
[01:44:49.077 --> 01:44:53.259]  And Tato and the rest of them, I mean, they're really trotting about right now.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:55.200]  We're at the crossroads.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:55.741]  I can feel it.
[01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:56.721]  I've been saying this for months.
[01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:59.783]  I mean, we are on the razor's edge right now.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.023]  You know, the delivery of whatever this abomination is, is coming.
[01:45:05.223 --> 01:45:08.686]  The birth pains are getting faster and faster and more severe.
[01:45:08.706 --> 01:45:11.948]  Now that's part one of part three.
[01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:21.556]  It could be real, these indictments could be coming down, and I predict massive terror attacks carried out by the criminal elements within the government to smoke screen it.
[01:45:22.157 --> 01:45:26.200]  But, it could be part B of three.
[01:45:28.063 --> 01:45:29.264]  I've got to write an article about this.
[01:45:29.284 --> 01:45:29.924]  This is important.
[01:45:29.945 --> 01:45:31.586]  In fact, I hope Paul Watson is listening.
[01:45:31.606 --> 01:45:35.229]  We've got to get an article together on this.
[01:45:35.249 --> 01:45:35.929]  Because this is important.
[01:45:35.949 --> 01:45:37.711]  We need to do key analysis.
[01:45:38.351 --> 01:45:39.232]  This is so obvious.
[01:45:39.532 --> 01:45:40.913]  Somebody else do analysis on it.
[01:45:40.933 --> 01:45:42.134]  I don't care if another website does it.
[01:45:42.515 --> 01:45:44.496]  We've just got to get this information out to people.
[01:45:46.798 --> 01:45:49.040]  You could call it Part 3B or just call it the fourth.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.142]  The fourth option is simple.
[01:45:51.942 --> 01:45:57.727]  The fourth is that, and again it could be any of these.
[01:45:58.709 --> 01:46:00.409]  More I think about it, I start leaning towards this one.
[01:46:00.930 --> 01:46:03.250]  The Elite, again, uses Bush like a tire.
[01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:05.251]  Or like toilet paper.
[01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:06.431]  Or like birdcage liner.
[01:46:06.591 --> 01:46:10.612]  Or like a filter in your wall for the air conditioner.
[01:46:11.272 --> 01:46:12.492]  It's disposable.
[01:46:13.853 --> 01:46:15.453]  Again, they take all the blame.
[01:46:15.633 --> 01:46:16.333]  They're the fence.
[01:46:16.413 --> 01:46:17.173]  They're the foil.
[01:46:17.193 --> 01:46:17.874]  They're the shill.
[01:46:18.174 --> 01:46:18.974]  They're the front.
[01:46:18.994 --> 01:46:19.734]  They're the shield.
[01:46:21.218 --> 01:46:22.459]  They take all the hits.
[01:46:22.519 --> 01:46:23.860]  They take all the firepower.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.001]  They take all the blame for the agenda.
[01:46:26.021 --> 01:46:27.122]  And they do this with Nixon.
[01:46:27.482 --> 01:46:28.723]  They did this with a lot of other people.
[01:46:30.124 --> 01:46:34.547]  I mean, Nixon did more for the New World Order than anybody in recent history, but then they hung him out dry.
[01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:44.694]  And then, because they know the revolutionary fervor is boiling up, everybody's waking up, people are really getting involved, people are waking up to terror attacks, the agenda is starting to stall now.
[01:46:46.175 --> 01:46:50.260]  I've seen them over and over again in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, and in U.S.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:50.660]  history.
[01:46:51.061 --> 01:47:02.294]  They will then have a scandal, remove the president, burn him, and then put in a crew who actually does even worse stuff, and everybody's so busy celebrating, and, oh, look, the system worked.
[01:47:02.935 --> 01:47:04.377]  Oh, we really did a great job.
[01:47:04.477 --> 01:47:05.318]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:47:07.316 --> 01:47:11.120]  And Bush will be blackmailed or knowingly fall on the sword politically.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:12.061]  This is what they do.
[01:47:12.121 --> 01:47:14.704]  It's like Kerry taking one for the team when he really won.
[01:47:14.724 --> 01:47:17.166]  They knew he was going to lose, but really win the vote.
[01:47:17.487 --> 01:47:18.528]  People are so outraged.
[01:47:18.888 --> 01:47:22.091]  But again, you can't just stage the vote without having the candidate go along with it.
[01:47:22.131 --> 01:47:22.772]  It was all staged.
[01:47:24.434 --> 01:47:25.695]  So he took one for the team.
[01:47:26.356 --> 01:47:30.360]  And then a few people in the Bush administration go to jail, and then Bush goes off into the hinterland.
[01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:32.898]  I mean, we know Bush Sr.
[01:47:32.918 --> 01:47:34.899]  didn't even campaign and just gave it to Bill Clinton.
[01:47:34.919 --> 01:47:36.359]  That's because it was all staged there.
[01:47:36.419 --> 01:47:37.419]  That's now publicly admitted.
[01:47:38.519 --> 01:47:41.280]  So this stuff is all going on.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:44.000]  And so you can pick what it is.
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:49.381]  I mean, it could be real and political and just this U.S.
[01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:52.362]  Attorney going after him.
[01:47:52.502 --> 01:47:55.142]  Or he could just be a good guy who's doing it, but I think he'd be dead.
[01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:57.343]  Or it could be that
[01:47:59.119 --> 01:48:01.941]  This is real and going ahead and Bush is going to carry out a terror attack.
[01:48:03.722 --> 01:48:06.444]  Or it could be that they're going to hang him out to dry.
[01:48:08.465 --> 01:48:12.508]  And of all of those, I don't know which it is.
[01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:19.132]  I've got to think about it some more, but perhaps in the next hour you can call in and comment on that and give us your take on it.
[01:48:19.192 --> 01:48:21.774]  But I like Tom Flanco.
[01:48:22.214 --> 01:48:24.356]  He's done a lot of really good reporting for years.
[01:48:25.256 --> 01:48:27.658]  But frankly, I'm not a big fan.
[01:48:28.534 --> 01:48:31.376]  Of some of his sources, lately on these stories.
[01:48:31.396 --> 01:48:33.077]  And I've said that, I'm allowed to have my opinion.
[01:48:33.498 --> 01:48:33.998]  Free country.
[01:48:35.619 --> 01:48:52.751]  And you know, to say that they arrested Barbara Olsen over in Europe, and then that story, you know, had countries bordering countries that don't, and had currencies existing that don't exist, I mean, I had to get on air and say, this really is ridiculous.
[01:48:57.017 --> 01:49:03.040]  So why do we have these sources putting this out about impending indictments, which we always said could be coming?
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:05.921]  I mean, this is what the grand jury does.
[01:49:06.581 --> 01:49:09.603]  They decide a no bill or to bill it, or to hand down an indictment.
[01:49:11.423 --> 01:49:19.407]  And, uh, you know, we have to wonder why these sources are here going to a good reporter, feeding him with information and then adding this other stuff into it, or when people hear it, uh, it's
[01:49:20.626 --> 01:49:22.908]  It's not taken seriously, that's all I have to say.
[01:49:23.268 --> 01:49:27.831]  But, uh, you know, if their indictments are handed down, certainly Tom Flocka will be completely vindicated.
[01:49:28.791 --> 01:49:38.618]  Uh, not that he even needs vindication, it's just that... I don't know, I mean, look at the track record of some of these sources, it's, uh... It's interesting, at least to be looked at.
[01:49:39.318 --> 01:49:43.821]  Uh, just to say the least, but, uh... No, I mean, it was never a stretch to say indictments could be handed down.
[01:49:43.861 --> 01:49:45.682]  I mean, that's what the grand jury's there for.
[01:49:46.603 --> 01:49:48.384]  I mean, I've been saying that since day one, but, uh...
[01:49:49.033 --> 01:49:50.594]  This whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:49:50.614 --> 01:49:51.995]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.556 --> 01:49:56.397]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[01:50:12.847 --> 01:50:15.690]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:20.434]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:42.113]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.273 --> 01:52:48.139]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:58.472 --> 01:53:04.693]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:53:05.073 --> 01:53:11.054]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway, so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:53:11.154 --> 01:53:13.475]  But remember, if you break the law you'll hear from me.
[01:53:13.495 --> 01:53:18.155]  The over-driving human instinct is to resist tyranny, to resist enslavement.
[01:53:19.936 --> 01:53:21.236]  They can propagandize
[01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:28.812]  Our conscious minds all day long, but deep down our instincts and our guts and our souls, we want freedom.
[01:53:30.333 --> 01:53:41.077]  And so all these scaredy-pants reporters, all these people who aren't on the government payroll, but are just useful idiots that have newspaper columns because they tell the line, they're all starting to wake up.
[01:53:41.778 --> 01:53:45.019]  But again, they're only waking up to the fact that Bush is corrupt.
[01:53:45.479 --> 01:53:46.600]  Once he's gone, whether
[01:53:48.047 --> 01:53:56.473]  By impeachment, or by indictment, or by his term ending, then they have to start that whole learning curve over again.
[01:53:57.594 --> 01:53:58.374]  And it's pathetic!
[01:53:59.635 --> 01:54:01.236]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:54:01.357 --> 01:54:03.198]  Bart in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:54:04.038 --> 01:54:04.539]  Hey Alex.
[01:54:04.819 --> 01:54:14.066]  Well, you know, what I wanted to say is, I have a main issue, but you know, there are three pillars that are necessary for the world population and the U.S.
[01:54:14.106 --> 01:54:15.927]  population to resist what's going on.
[01:54:16.736 --> 01:54:25.104]  One is their Second Amendment right, the second is their First Amendment right, and the third is getting rid of these black box voting machines.
[01:54:25.144 --> 01:54:31.450]  The one that, and everyone seems to think that theirs is the most important, but the one that I focus on is the First Amendment right.
[01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:37.616]  And you've been, you know, we've called in before and we've talked to you about the battle down here for Houston public access.
[01:54:38.325 --> 01:54:49.207]  But what I was calling in today to specifically highlight is this bill that has been put out by Senator John McCain to do away with all public access by removing the franchising fees across the country.
[01:54:50.548 --> 01:54:57.929]  I would really encourage your listeners to become aware of that issue and to start calling their congressmen to fight this.
[01:54:58.629 --> 01:55:03.530]  The New World Order, they understand that they can't compete with our message.
[01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:05.091]  They can't compete with the truth.
[01:55:05.171 --> 01:55:06.071]  You know, one person
[01:55:06.724 --> 01:55:07.645]  I'm listening to you Bart!
[01:55:37.472 --> 01:55:45.358]  So, I mean, there's a lobby in Washington called the Alliance for Democratic Media.
[01:55:46.078 --> 01:55:48.980]  You can go on there, you can become an activist through that organization.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.021]  I've researched them.
[01:55:50.481 --> 01:55:56.345]  They'll send you out the information of who your congressman in your district is just by typing in your zip code.
[01:55:56.385 --> 01:56:01.309]  And I would encourage everyone, if you're not already in this battle, to get in the battle.
[01:56:01.349 --> 01:56:06.052]  Whether it's for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, or getting rid of these black box voting machines.
[01:56:06.621 --> 01:56:09.523]  That is the hand-to-hand combat with the New World Order.
[01:56:09.543 --> 01:56:10.984]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:56:11.004 --> 01:56:11.624]  Great points.
[01:56:12.905 --> 01:56:15.586]  For those that don't know, I'm against socialism.
[01:56:15.626 --> 01:56:26.373]  I'm against government funding of basically anything other than major roads and defending the nation's ports and borders.
[01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:34.154]  I believe the states and counties and cities should take care of the general welfare for those that fall into the cracks.
[01:56:34.474 --> 01:56:44.799]  It's really the job of the charities, but as a society becomes dependent on government and corrupt, people stop doing that and count more and more on the government to do it, and the government doesn't do anything without a price.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:48.602]  But, cable companies, what does Time Warner make?
[01:56:48.642 --> 01:56:52.624]  Just off Austin Market, I think it's $25 million in profit a year, on top of
[01:56:53.573 --> 01:56:54.754]  You know, all the money they bring in.
[01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:56.055]  And that's fine and dandy.
[01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:57.776]  They don't make me have Time Warner cable.
[01:56:57.837 --> 01:56:58.177]  I have it.
[01:56:58.237 --> 01:56:58.877]  It's pretty good.
[01:57:00.959 --> 01:57:09.486]  But they got a monopoly here for the last quarter century plus.
[01:57:09.506 --> 01:57:10.827]  They've had a monopoly here.
[01:57:11.447 --> 01:57:12.748]  No one else could screen cable.
[01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:16.091]  Now there's some other cable systems being put in, but they've still got the lion's share.
[01:57:17.705 --> 01:57:27.191]  And the two cable systems in Austin have to give about 34 cents out of each bill so that city and government can be on the channels.
[01:57:27.952 --> 01:57:29.253]  I think that's a great thing.
[01:57:29.393 --> 01:57:30.033]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:32.315 --> 01:57:37.198]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.718 --> 01:57:49.359]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.039 --> 01:57:51.120]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.801 --> 01:57:52.982]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.582 --> 01:57:54.403]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.124 --> 01:57:57.065]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.085 --> 01:58:00.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.888 --> 01:58:05.032]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.473 --> 01:58:15.781]  Alright, we're now blasting into the third hour, and I'm extremely honored and pleased to have Jim Tucker of American Free Press, veteran journalist,
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.802]  Joining us to talk about his new treasure that everybody has got to get.
[01:58:21.842 --> 01:58:23.223]  In fact, we're carrying it.
[01:58:24.143 --> 01:58:25.044]  We're very selective.
[01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:32.367]  We're carrying it at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on our secure online shopping cart because it's such a great book.
[01:58:32.407 --> 01:58:39.430]  We just got two cases of it of the book in today and we have them right now if you want to order one.
[01:58:39.490 --> 01:58:43.492]  It is Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diaries and
[01:58:44.366 --> 01:58:52.089]  It's over a quarter century of Jim Tucker breaking and pushing and exposing some of the biggest stories in the world.
[01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:54.250]  Knowing when the Berlin Wall would go down.
[01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:56.291]  Knowing when the invasion of Iraq would be.
[01:58:56.311 --> 01:58:59.873]  When everybody else was saying it'd be in March of 2002, he said 2003.
[01:59:00.353 --> 01:59:06.195]  Countless examples of sneaking through drainage holes and climbing in windows and being arrested and being detained.
[01:59:06.255 --> 01:59:08.756]  I mean, he's a modern gumshoe
[01:59:12.285 --> 01:59:16.127]  Classical, muckraking, bare-knuckles reporter.
[01:59:16.147 --> 01:59:20.369]  If we had a thousand of Jim Tuckers, the New World Order would be as smoking ashy.
[01:59:21.149 --> 01:59:24.911]  And so he's going to talk about just his experiences over the years and what he covers in the book.
[01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:32.394]  Believe me, I just got a promotional copy about three or four days ago, haven't put it down, almost finished it.
[01:59:33.246 --> 01:59:41.852]  I've learned so much and then I just got these two cases in today and I suggest you call and get them again at InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:42.573 --> 01:59:46.336]  I'm so glad Jim did this.
[01:59:47.116 --> 01:59:48.497]  This is really exciting.
[01:59:49.318 --> 01:59:50.499]  Jim, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:59:51.255 --> 01:59:53.056]  Well, thank you for that introduction.
[01:59:53.636 --> 01:59:57.738]  And when I go to that great press box up in the sky, I want you to write my obituary.
[01:59:59.079 --> 02:00:01.620]  Well, it's a good book and it's just so much information.
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.421]  And this is real history, Jim.
[02:00:05.122 --> 02:00:07.944]  Yes, it's a large part of the unwritten history of our time.
[02:00:09.164 --> 02:00:09.645]  Absolutely.
[02:00:09.705 --> 02:00:14.787]  Tell us, for those that don't know who you are, that's very few of our listeners, but probably tens of thousands that are listening don't know.
[02:00:15.067 --> 02:00:17.489]  Tell us about Jim Tucker and how you got involved.
[02:00:17.509 --> 02:00:20.030]  Then we're going to break and we'll come back and talk about the new book.
[02:00:21.191 --> 02:00:21.551]  Very good.
[02:00:21.592 --> 02:00:25.354]  My first 20 years was with classic daily newspapers.
[02:00:25.454 --> 02:00:27.695]  I was editor of a couple of small dailies.
[02:00:27.715 --> 02:00:31.998]  I was copy editor of the Richmond Times Dispatch in Richmond, Virginia.
[02:00:32.018 --> 02:00:36.581]  I was editor of the Washington Daily News when it folded up in 1974.
[02:00:36.821 --> 02:00:42.245]  I was assistant news editor, whatever that meant, of the Akron Beacon Journal.
[02:00:43.306 --> 02:00:48.429]  So in 1975, after 20 happy years with daily establishment newspapers,
[02:00:49.432 --> 02:00:55.955]  I found myself in Washington being interviewed by Willis Carter for the job of getting him pregnant and creating a paper called The Spotlight.
[02:00:56.855 --> 02:01:03.278]  They had very busy newsletters then, but they decided to go weekly with the journal to convey more information to the readers.
[02:01:04.199 --> 02:01:09.981]  My job was to create the newspaper, which was a lot of fun, but then he asked me a stumping question.
[02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:11.742]  Why do you think of Bilderberg?
[02:01:12.502 --> 02:01:13.583]  I said, who the hell are they?
[02:01:14.523 --> 02:01:15.443]  He started to tell me.
[02:01:15.503 --> 02:01:16.484]  I said, I can't believe that.
[02:01:17.196 --> 02:01:21.520]  I've been with Daily Newspapers for 20 years and such a group could not exist without me knowing about it.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:25.002]  Scripps Howard had staff all over the world.
[02:01:25.683 --> 02:01:32.108]  Scripps Howard was the parent of the Washington Daily News with headquarters on the same floor of the Daily News building as the Daily News staff.
[02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:43.417]  But he loaded me down with newsletters that included photographic reprints of the late great Westbrook Pegler's first exposé of Bilderberg in 1957.
[02:01:45.606 --> 02:02:04.715]  Tegeler did not know they called themselves Bilderberg, but he did know, as he looked through his binoculars, that when a bunch of international financiers and political leaders gathered behind armed guards at Jekyll Island, Georgia, I think it was, that something strange was going on, and he raised the obvious questions that we've raised ever since.
[02:02:05.655 --> 02:02:14.219]  And there's been sprinklings in other scholarly journals and so forth, but no real in-depth reporting at all on Bilderberg until
[02:02:15.209 --> 02:02:17.511]  All right, Jim, we're going to break.
[02:02:17.551 --> 02:02:23.234]  We'll be right back in three short minutes with Jim Tucker and his new powerhouse book.
[02:02:44.289 --> 02:02:45.811]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:49.094]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:49.214 --> 02:02:53.118]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:53.158 --> 02:02:57.402]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:57.742 --> 02:03:01.526]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:01.606 --> 02:03:03.528]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:03.668 --> 02:03:06.992]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.113]  The medical bills!
[02:03:09.694 --> 02:03:11.715]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:11.875 --> 02:03:14.916]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:15.076 --> 02:03:17.958]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:18.438 --> 02:03:24.541]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:25.081 --> 02:03:28.882]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:29.282 --> 02:03:30.643]  Order your video today.
[02:03:30.983 --> 02:03:32.043]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:32.063 --> 02:03:34.324]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:34.404 --> 02:03:35.644]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:46.781 --> 02:03:51.264]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:55.706]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.006 --> 02:03:56.547]  We listened.
[02:03:56.867 --> 02:04:01.850]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:02.610]  We listened.
[02:04:02.991 --> 02:04:06.032]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.453 --> 02:04:06.973]  We listened.
[02:04:07.433 --> 02:04:11.494]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.874 --> 02:04:12.374]  We listened.
[02:04:12.714 --> 02:04:17.956]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.356 --> 02:04:19.716]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.096 --> 02:04:27.478]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.859 --> 02:04:31.300]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[02:04:37.347 --> 02:04:38.310]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:39.774]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.161 --> 02:04:48.623]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[02:04:48.983 --> 02:04:54.007]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[02:04:54.147 --> 02:04:55.528]  But now, we don't have to.
[02:04:55.808 --> 02:05:03.974]  This sacro wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[02:05:04.315 --> 02:05:08.338]  Simply lie on your back with the sacro wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[02:05:08.578 --> 02:05:11.360]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:15.263]  Use the sacro wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[02:05:15.703 --> 02:05:19.364]  Get your Sacro wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:05:19.604 --> 02:05:21.004]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:22.125 --> 02:05:28.886]  That's 877-817-9829 and ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[02:05:29.286 --> 02:05:31.867]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[02:05:31.907 --> 02:05:35.208]  Get your Sacro wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.
[02:05:35.508 --> 02:05:35.748]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:35.788 --> 02:05:36.948]  That's 877-817-9829 and give yourself a wedgie.
[02:05:44.604 --> 02:05:50.229]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.134 --> 02:05:58.656]  It's the new book!
[02:05:58.676 --> 02:06:04.822]  25 plus years of covering the global elite, the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission has 300 plus members.
[02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:11.331]  The CFR has over 2,500 now.
[02:06:11.791 --> 02:06:14.432]  The Bilderberg Group only has around 125 to 140.
[02:06:14.672 --> 02:06:19.053]  And they may have about 75 guests.
[02:06:19.193 --> 02:06:22.914]  Congressmen, Senators, Governors that come and are vetted.
[02:06:23.474 --> 02:06:28.876]  And boy, if you get invited to the Bilderberg Group, your star is going up if you impress them.
[02:06:30.191 --> 02:06:43.043]  And we are joined by Jim Tucker, who for over a quarter of a century, and he got a quarter century as a newsman before that, for a quarter of a century plus, covered the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:44.105 --> 02:06:52.629]  And there had only been a few news reports before that about these elite meetings behind armed guards, predominantly in Europe, by other investigative journalists.
[02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:58.391]  But Jim blew it wide open and really burrowed into it, and literally snuck in to these meetings.
[02:06:58.891 --> 02:07:02.473]  I got so much inside intel, much of what we know about the New World Order.
[02:07:04.122 --> 02:07:06.725]  Again, Jim's information just checks out time and time again.
[02:07:07.085 --> 02:07:07.866]  That's the key.
[02:07:07.926 --> 02:07:08.726]  It's hindsight.
[02:07:09.207 --> 02:07:12.510]  Time gives you a chance to see if a reporter is really excellent.
[02:07:13.050 --> 02:07:15.713]  And Jim is just of the classical mold.
[02:07:15.753 --> 02:07:16.674]  I'm not kissing up to him.
[02:07:16.954 --> 02:07:21.758]  He's one of the greats out there and he needs to be honored as one of the elders in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:07:22.439 --> 02:07:25.422]  Jim, there was just a big History Channel piece that you were in.
[02:07:25.442 --> 02:07:29.285]  That was made some time ago.
[02:07:32.344 --> 02:07:37.606]  They show it every once in a while when they want to get their audience increased among lovesick young girls.
[02:07:38.586 --> 02:07:39.287]  That was 1975.
[02:07:39.427 --> 02:07:47.210]  In the early years of Vertigo Spotlight, I presided over coverage by correspondents that had already been in place for the newsletters.
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:01.463]  For instance, if Bilderberg met in Europe, he'd be one of our European correspondents.
[02:08:01.543 --> 02:08:03.945]  If he met in North America, he'd be one of our guys.
[02:08:03.965 --> 02:08:06.026]  If he met in Canada, he'd be one of our guys.
[02:08:06.046 --> 02:08:10.390]  So we're not talking about 25 years, we're talking about almost 30 years then.
[02:08:10.450 --> 02:08:16.535]  Yeah, in fact, it's my 30th anniversary right now with the spotlight in American Free Press.
[02:08:18.236 --> 02:08:20.798]  It was about 1983 that I started doing it myself.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.142]  Amazing, so you've been covering it that long.
[02:08:27.307 --> 02:08:28.568]  I mean, talk about the book.
[02:08:28.788 --> 02:08:30.009]  Why should people get this book?
[02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:31.630]  I mean, I think it's great.
[02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:34.512]  Tell us some of the interesting stories that are in there.
[02:08:34.832 --> 02:08:37.953]  Things you experienced, things you discovered covering Bilderberg.
[02:08:39.394 --> 02:08:50.901]  Well, over the years, as you mentioned earlier, early years of covering Bilderberg, some of the reporters could gather around the Men's Bar at the National Press Club and say, but how can you show you're not fabricating all this?
[02:08:51.593 --> 02:08:53.133]  I said, first of all, you know me better than that.
[02:08:53.594 --> 02:08:55.894]  Some of you guys I've been on the news service with years before.
[02:08:56.434 --> 02:08:57.535]  Secondly, check me out.
[02:08:58.175 --> 02:09:11.218]  So over the years with Bill with the track record, the advance story on the downfall of Maggie Thatcher, the advance story on President Bush the elder, breaking his famous read my lips no new taxes pledge under pressure of Bilderberg.
[02:09:11.919 --> 02:09:18.200]  At the same time they had young, obscure governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, attending that 1991 meeting.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:19.361]  He's elected president 1992.
[02:09:22.497 --> 02:09:47.431]  As you said, the advance on the end of the Cold War, and several of those things, and after Lady Thatcher was dumped as the Prime Minister, replaced by a trapeze artist from her own party, I had a chance to natter with her about it briefly at some reception in Washington, and she told me that she considered being denounced by Bill O'Brien to be a tribute.
[02:09:47.471 --> 02:09:48.492]  She used the word tribute.
[02:09:49.309 --> 02:09:57.015]  And he denounced the idea of any head of state yielding one bit of national sovereignty to an international organization.
[02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:58.196]  She was very strong on that.
[02:09:59.176 --> 02:10:02.239]  And of course confirmed what had taken place.
[02:10:02.859 --> 02:10:11.746]  Well, as I said, we had written months in advance that they would try to dump her, which they did quite successfully with very little effort.
[02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:14.131]  Amazing.
[02:10:14.171 --> 02:10:24.881]  And then I remember having you on a year before the Iraq invasion and the news was saying, conclusively, Washington Post, CNN, Fox News, we will invade, we will invade in March of this year.
[02:10:24.961 --> 02:10:25.982]  It's going to happen.
[02:10:26.403 --> 02:10:37.474]  And then you said, uh-uh, contraire, our sources inside Bilderberg, multiple sources, the invasion comes, and we have the transcript, the invasion comes, you said, in March
[02:10:39.255 --> 02:10:42.718]  I mean, that shows they're running things, Jim!
[02:10:42.858 --> 02:10:54.607]  Well, what the newspapers were saying is that in the year 2002, it'll be this summer or early fall at the latest.
[02:10:55.207 --> 02:11:05.455]  And what demonstrates the loyalty to Bilderberg over your own professional standards is demonstrated by the presence of the publisher of the Washington Post, Donald Graham.
[02:11:05.948 --> 02:11:14.852]  As you know, every post publisher, since the late Bill Graham and now the late Katherine Graham, now her little boy, has attended all of Bilderberg meetings on the promise of absolute secrecy.
[02:11:15.493 --> 02:11:21.936]  So, Jimmy Lee Hoagland, their associate editor and op-ed columnist, and Donald Graham attend.
[02:11:22.316 --> 02:11:34.802]  They had to have heard Secretary Rumsfeld tell Bilderberg, and some of the European Bilderbergs opposed the invasion of Iraq, and many still do, the only time, to my knowledge, they've
[02:11:35.965 --> 02:11:37.506]  We're good to go.
[02:12:03.826 --> 02:12:06.249]  Well, let me bring up a few issues that tie into being a reporter.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:28.846]  The news of $244 million for fake newscasts last year alone, bought by Bush covertly.
[02:12:28.887 --> 02:12:35.172]  The Armstrong Williams, the lady at the New York Times getting CIA money for aluminum tube stories.
[02:12:35.713 --> 02:12:39.777]  I mean, thousands of reporters on the dole, agents being paid.
[02:12:40.457 --> 02:12:48.699]  On a host of issues, and now this being headline news, and the Congress and others saying, this is patently illegal, but nobody gets in trouble.
[02:12:48.939 --> 02:12:51.599]  You know, where's the grand jury calling for indictments on that?
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:56.400]  As a newsman, to just see it out in the open, how does that affect you?
[02:12:57.681 --> 02:13:01.361]  Outrage, of course, but history goes back years and years ago.
[02:13:02.182 --> 02:13:08.463]  It was disclosed that a lot of reporters, some from the New York Times and other major newspapers, were also CIA sources.
[02:13:09.224 --> 02:13:12.326]  Well, that seems to be a little bit of a compromising position to me.
[02:13:12.346 --> 02:13:18.309]  Let's take the CIA money at the same time your newspaper is reporting on the CIA.
[02:13:19.110 --> 02:13:19.970]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:13:20.010 --> 02:13:27.755]  Shifting gears yet again, in your 50 years of reporting the news, Jim Tucker,
[02:13:28.738 --> 02:13:32.859]  Have you ever seen it more corrupt than it is now and more out of the open?
[02:13:32.899 --> 02:13:35.279]  I mean, they're just letting it all hang out.
[02:13:35.959 --> 02:13:39.280]  The Senate says no more torture and Bush says, I'm going to keep torturing.
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:40.860]  I'm going to veto it.
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:44.161]  Just Halliburton running the bids right out of the White House.
[02:13:45.021 --> 02:13:47.541]  Bush with gay porn stars running around in the White House.
[02:13:47.601 --> 02:13:49.982]  I mean, it's just, it's a circus.
[02:13:51.062 --> 02:13:51.362]  It is.
[02:13:51.482 --> 02:13:56.163]  It's a strange choice as far as the Supreme Court nominee is concerned.
[02:13:56.966 --> 02:13:57.607]  We're good to go.
[02:14:22.208 --> 02:14:32.852]  But she did have a very good dissent in the domain case.
[02:14:33.212 --> 02:14:36.254]  She ended on a good note.
[02:14:36.314 --> 02:14:43.396]  She did, but she was among the justices who said, it's unbelievable, that we should consider
[02:14:45.576 --> 02:15:05.104]  Yeah, I saw her in the, what was it, USA Today and Washington Post four years ago when this first started and people were like, we didn't believe you Alex, we didn't believe the spotlight, but no, it's true, they're saying that we should follow the EU and UN courts, that they are above us.
[02:15:06.202 --> 02:15:13.004]  Uh, she even cited some decisions made by some African, uh, uh, Supreme Court, some African nation.
[02:15:13.484 --> 02:15:15.344]  I forgot which one of those little countries it was.
[02:15:15.384 --> 02:15:17.365]  I remember when it turned out that country had a dictator.
[02:15:17.685 --> 02:15:18.625]  Yeah.
[02:15:19.565 --> 02:15:28.908]  Uh, how in the world could, uh, uh, the opinion of any foreign court be, uh, possibly used to construe our own constitution?
[02:15:29.228 --> 02:15:34.789]  But if it's possible, from what I've been seeing with her record, uh, this new Myers lady is worse than her.
[02:15:36.090 --> 02:15:37.951]  She has such a very little record.
[02:15:37.971 --> 02:15:40.353]  The President's saying, uh, trust me.
[02:15:41.013 --> 02:15:43.214]  Well, he's got, uh, say, platoons.
[02:15:43.274 --> 02:15:58.803]  If he wanted to hit a politically correct home run, he had a Negro woman that's putting them both together, who has a judicial history similar to the Clarence Thomas or the Scalia type.
[02:15:59.223 --> 02:16:00.644]  Good, strict constructionist.
[02:16:01.144 --> 02:16:01.945]  He could have named her.
[02:16:01.965 --> 02:16:04.046]  There's Priscilla Owens, another woman.
[02:16:05.102 --> 02:16:20.356]  Although she's white, if there's got to be a girl seated on the court, he could have filled it with people with known credentials, not some mystery woman whose greatest asset seems to be her devotion to the president.
[02:16:20.417 --> 02:16:28.404]  Well, that's okay for a clerk type as the secretary or even your general counsel, but it should not be a measurement of your qualifications for the Supreme Court.
[02:16:29.221 --> 02:16:30.322]  Jim, we're about to break.
[02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:32.585]  I want to get into some of your adventures.
[02:16:33.626 --> 02:16:38.431]  And there's adventures in the book that I had, I guess I hadn't read issues, you know, 10-15 years ago.
[02:16:38.671 --> 02:16:44.837]  There were some adventures I wasn't even aware of that you had sneaking into Bilderberg and your spies and the rest of it.
[02:16:44.938 --> 02:16:50.563]  Also, you wrote a very powerful article that we syndicated over at PrisonPlanet.com and AmericanPrePress.net.
[02:16:52.216 --> 02:16:59.281]  Very powerful article about, I believe the headline was, Military to Occupy U.S., Bush Occupying U.S.
[02:16:59.521 --> 02:17:00.862]  That's exactly how I put it.
[02:17:01.162 --> 02:17:07.106]  With his Indo-Paci-Commentatus, Bush wants to lead his troops across the Rubicon into Rome, literally.
[02:17:07.547 --> 02:17:11.069]  And I want to get your historical analysis of that as well, Jim.
[02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:13.591]  What are some of the other things that you want to cover when we get back?
[02:17:13.891 --> 02:17:14.271]  Very good.
[02:17:15.372 --> 02:17:15.752]  All right.
[02:17:17.288 --> 02:17:20.191]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're carrying this book.
[02:17:20.211 --> 02:17:23.254]  We're going to be expanding what's on the book and video store.
[02:17:23.874 --> 02:17:30.541]  The titles we carry over at infowars.com and presentplanet.tv.

[02:17:37.447 --> 02:17:42.312]  Believe me, it doesn't get any more interesting and informative.

[02:19:42.387 --> 02:19:46.371]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:47.111]  One and the same.
[02:19:47.191 --> 02:19:49.913]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:19:58.334 --> 02:20:03.799]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:04.219 --> 02:20:07.342]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:07.602 --> 02:20:09.444]  The bank pays you 1%.
[02:20:09.504 --> 02:20:12.967]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:13.207 --> 02:20:15.289]  Here is reality.
[02:20:15.669 --> 02:20:19.232]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:19.733 --> 02:20:23.396]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:23.957 --> 02:20:25.398]  Gold in the same time frame

[02:21:35.116 --> 02:21:41.839]  Or log on to dentalplans.com right now.
[02:21:48.603 --> 02:21:50.684]  Your calls are coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:52.865 --> 02:21:58.769]  We'll be talking to Elizabeth and Alex and Ron and others before this hour ends with Jim Tucker.
[02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:01.270]  Jim Tucker,
[02:22:03.453 --> 02:22:06.857]  We hear discussions of indictments of Karl Rove right now.
[02:22:07.758 --> 02:22:09.961]  They're talking about this U.S.
[02:22:10.001 --> 02:22:11.663]  attorney in Chicago indicting him.
[02:22:11.703 --> 02:22:12.884]  I've been hearing this for months.
[02:22:13.245 --> 02:22:14.627]  Now it's in the Washington Post.
[02:22:14.687 --> 02:22:15.988]  Now it's in the New York Times.
[02:22:16.589 --> 02:22:19.032]  Open discussion of indictments of Karl Rove.
[02:22:19.671 --> 02:22:25.593]  Clearly he could be indicted for the plane situation, but why haven't grand juries indicted him on a thousand other areas?
[02:22:26.153 --> 02:22:30.635]  And we know the penchant in this government for killing people is a lot higher up than U.S.
[02:22:30.675 --> 02:22:31.115]  Attorneys.
[02:22:31.175 --> 02:22:36.317]  I mean, if he's really moving to indict, I would imagine he'd die in a plane crash or car wreck very quickly.
[02:22:36.937 --> 02:22:38.057]  What's your take on that, Jim?
[02:22:38.377 --> 02:22:47.821]  Well, the uh, the only thing that seems a speculation now is the other several times he's appeared before the grand jury, he was told, we're not seeking an indictment against you.
[02:22:48.141 --> 02:22:48.841]  You're not a target.
[02:22:49.341 --> 02:22:55.944]  This time, it appears they have not told him that you're not a target and there will be no indictment.
[02:22:56.244 --> 02:22:57.685]  Yeah, they told him you may be arrested.
[02:22:58.185 --> 02:22:58.945]  You may be indicted.
[02:22:59.705 --> 02:23:05.928]  They said that by their silence, by not saying that he's not a target, not saying that he will not be indicted.
[02:23:07.229 --> 02:23:09.570]  Absolutely, so... We'll have to see how it plays out.
[02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:11.931]  What do you know about this U.S.
[02:23:11.991 --> 02:23:12.851]  Attorney Fitzgerald?
[02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:15.272]  Very little.
[02:23:17.426 --> 02:23:20.448]  Yeah, I've tried to do research on him, and I know he's going after Daley.
[02:23:20.468 --> 02:23:22.409]  He's going after the Daley machine.
[02:23:24.571 --> 02:23:26.672]  Well, that's what U.S.
[02:23:26.752 --> 02:23:35.918]  Attorneys do, and of course, they do like to have the big-name target, because that gets headlines for them, which enhances their resumes.
[02:23:36.399 --> 02:23:43.463]  I'm not saying that's the whole reason, but yeah, Richard Daley would be a typical target, more because of his daddy as well.
[02:23:43.744 --> 02:23:45.545]  His late father was well-known as the
[02:23:46.144 --> 02:23:50.886]  What do you think about Ronnie Earl going after Tom DeLay?
[02:23:50.906 --> 02:23:55.167]  I sort of think of two boys in a muddy field throwing dead cats at each other.
[02:24:16.505 --> 02:24:36.278]  Delay pointed out in today's morning newspapers that the guy who has indicted him also took corporate money in the Washington Post point out that while he said that Delay took money from corporations and from labor unions, the very record shows that he too has taken money from corporations and labor unions.
[02:24:37.739 --> 02:24:38.520]  Well, exactly.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.583]  It's strictly Texas laws now because it's perfectly legal to take money from labor unions and so forth.
[02:24:44.299 --> 02:24:49.443]  Uh, in the rest of the world, but Texas has its own laws, and DeLay is accused of violating those laws.
[02:24:50.604 --> 02:24:55.928]  And then Ronnie Earl indicted him for something that wasn't even illegal at the time that DeLay did it.
[02:24:57.049 --> 02:24:59.210]  Uh, well, he had to go before three grand juries.
[02:24:59.250 --> 02:25:07.717]  Believe me, this is no defense of Roe, but, uh, he did have to go before three grand juries before he finally found one that he liked.
[02:25:08.453 --> 02:25:11.055]  Well, that's why I've said I'm against these indictments.
[02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:19.362]  Not that I like Tom DeLay, but I would rather somebody go free who's involved in crooked activity than have a government that fixes the system.
[02:25:19.582 --> 02:25:24.766]  It's much more dangerous to have an oppressive government than just some lone scallywags.
[02:25:24.786 --> 02:25:25.246]  Do you agree?
[02:25:25.266 --> 02:25:25.727]  Yep.
[02:25:26.527 --> 02:25:31.991]  Like Clarence Darrow once said, better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent man be punished.
[02:25:33.313 --> 02:25:37.015]  That is one of the founts or keystones to freedom, isn't it?
[02:25:37.356 --> 02:25:37.656]  Certainly.
[02:25:38.639 --> 02:25:44.700]  Jim, you wrote an incredible article about martial law in this country, and even CNN said Bush is wanting martial law.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:51.002]  I mean, he's openly saying he wants to bring his legions into our cities.
[02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:53.522]  This is unprecedented, and you've written an article about it.
[02:25:53.822 --> 02:25:55.403]  Yes, it's very troubling.
[02:25:58.023 --> 02:26:01.684]  Historically, the Army has no domestic dues.
[02:26:01.724 --> 02:26:02.784]  They defend our shores.
[02:26:03.364 --> 02:26:07.385]  The only time they have a role to perform domestically is
[02:26:08.149 --> 02:26:12.731]  When they have to defend our shores from outside attack, we have to defend the country right here at home.
[02:26:13.451 --> 02:26:14.571]  Now, that they're not doing.
[02:26:14.591 --> 02:26:17.552]  They're not defending the southern border, which is the most porous.
[02:26:18.232 --> 02:26:20.153]  And the Canadian border also needs protection.
[02:26:21.053 --> 02:26:32.017]  Now, we've got the Army guarding borders for 116 different countries around the world with these UN missions, of which taxpayers pay one-fourth of the cost of the
[02:26:33.886 --> 02:26:39.407]  General operating expenses of the UN, one-third of the cost of the so-called peacekeeping missions.
[02:26:39.907 --> 02:26:45.168]  But we do not have our soldiers deployed along the southern border with Mexico where they belong.
[02:26:47.409 --> 02:26:54.850]  So this idea that if we have a bad storm, and under the law now, it's perfectly efficient.
[02:26:56.251 --> 02:26:57.971]  You know about hurricanes days in advance.
[02:26:58.550 --> 02:27:01.473]  The Governor has to make that request.
[02:27:19.176 --> 02:27:31.305]  The only time under our system of laws that the president can do so without a governor's request is to declare that state's infraction against the United States.
[02:27:31.545 --> 02:27:32.265]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:32.345 --> 02:27:32.966]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:32.986 --> 02:27:33.566]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.847 --> 02:27:35.748]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.248 --> 02:27:37.849]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:41.432]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.884 --> 02:27:47.245]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:47.505 --> 02:27:51.325]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:27:51.646 --> 02:27:52.466]  Read the labels.
[02:27:52.906 --> 02:27:57.027]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:57.247 --> 02:28:01.428]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:01.808 --> 02:28:06.689]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:07.069 --> 02:28:10.611]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:10.831 --> 02:28:16.175]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:16.455 --> 02:28:19.196]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:19.477 --> 02:28:20.377]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:28:44.662 --> 02:28:46.303]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:46.423 --> 02:28:50.546]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:50.666 --> 02:28:53.547]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:53.627 --> 02:29:00.352]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:00.532 --> 02:29:03.533]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:06.135]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:06.255 --> 02:29:10.978]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:11.158 --> 02:29:25.721]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[02:29:56.763 --> 02:30:04.666]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:04.806 --> 02:30:11.848]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.068 --> 02:30:13.289]  There are no side effects!
[02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:16.990]  Join others in discovering a return to natural and make the cause.
[02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:24.034]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:59.544]  Now let's be clear about this, because Jim Tucker showed the law and the case law and the history in the article he wrote, but this is one of our specialties.
[02:30:59.564 --> 02:31:02.685]  We've really studied posse comitatus and disasters and how this works.
[02:31:03.465 --> 02:31:06.647]  The feds intentionally screwed up the relief efforts in New Orleans.
[02:31:06.687 --> 02:31:10.588]  They blocked communications, cut communications, wouldn't let the help get in.
[02:31:12.361 --> 02:31:19.689]  And as Jim just said, the only time the President can ignore a state not asking them in is if that state is seen as in a state of rebellion.
[02:31:21.171 --> 02:31:30.201]  And even that is some civil law power that they've been... war powers power that they've been claiming since the Civil War.
[02:31:31.184 --> 02:31:33.405]  That is a fraud, a 10th Amendment violation.
[02:31:33.805 --> 02:31:35.746]  You hear what the Founding Fathers say, that's criminal.
[02:31:35.786 --> 02:31:39.348]  But that's a criminal power the Feds declare unto themselves.
[02:31:39.448 --> 02:31:43.289]  Why on earth is the President talking about circumnavigating the states?
[02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:48.351]  I mean, if the President's got to do something and it's so good, wouldn't the governors before it?
[02:31:48.391 --> 02:31:52.633]  Well, 48 of the governors in a letter sent to Bush are against it.
[02:31:53.013 --> 02:31:56.515]  But Mitt Romney and only one other, the governor of Minnesota,
[02:31:57.430 --> 02:32:00.271]  Romney of Massachusetts and then the other governor of Minnesota.
[02:32:00.512 --> 02:32:02.032]  They're the only ones that are for it.
[02:32:02.132 --> 02:32:03.313]  Oh yes, oh yes.
[02:32:03.713 --> 02:32:11.997]  Now again, five days before the hurricane hit Katrina, a call went in to NORTHCOM and they were ready.
[02:32:12.897 --> 02:32:14.898]  And the governor had already asked them in.
[02:32:15.338 --> 02:32:17.459]  And Bush said, you've got to capitulate totally to me.
[02:32:17.479 --> 02:32:18.339]  And she said, what does that mean?
[02:32:18.359 --> 02:32:19.280]  I've already asked you in.
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:21.261]  And then the troops were there.
[02:32:21.441 --> 02:32:23.722]  So this is all done deliberately.
[02:32:23.782 --> 02:32:26.003]  And now, I mean, Jim, did you ever think you'd
[02:32:26.841 --> 02:32:31.425]  Live to see the President on TV going every day, oh a flood hit, give me martial law.
[02:32:32.065 --> 02:32:34.187]  Oh a terrorist might hit, give me martial law.
[02:32:34.767 --> 02:32:39.731]  Oh there might be a biological problem, give me martial law.
[02:32:40.171 --> 02:32:42.753]  Martial law, martial law, martial law.
[02:32:43.013 --> 02:32:50.139]  And as you said so eloquently, the borders are wide open, the place where in the Constitution we're supposed to have troops.
[02:32:50.999 --> 02:32:55.403]  Well this is very troubling of course because of the
[02:32:56.181 --> 02:32:56.801]  We're good to go.
[02:33:25.453 --> 02:33:31.217]  He's also saying that if we have some kind of big epidemic, it goes right to martial law.
[02:33:31.897 --> 02:33:41.503]  So the President is saying that he can declare martial law if it's raining too hard, or if there's a flu epidemic.
[02:33:42.184 --> 02:33:48.988]  And of course, the scientists are concerned about having a huge pandemic before everybody gets their knickers in, which is concerning.
[02:33:49.008 --> 02:33:50.429]  In fact, they say it's very unlikely.
[02:33:51.075 --> 02:33:58.747]  But if they do, if we do have a pandemic of this strange bird flu virus, that we need to make more vaccines.
[02:33:58.807 --> 02:34:00.470]  Well, that's a stockpile more vaccine.
[02:34:02.327 --> 02:34:07.330]  But using that is to say that if I think people are sneezing too much, I'll take over state.
[02:34:07.530 --> 02:34:17.937]  But specifically what he's asking for and what Warner has been talking about, and I've had JAG generals retired on about this, he's not even asking for in those specific problems.
[02:34:18.257 --> 02:34:22.820]  He's just saying get rid of it, period, and let the military police America.
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:29.624]  And it's always been so important to Americans that we do not, like so many European countries, have a nationalist force.
[02:34:30.365 --> 02:34:35.728]  The FBI, traditionally, is an information gathering agency, investigating only.
[02:34:35.748 --> 02:34:38.470]  Their duties were limited.
[02:34:38.490 --> 02:34:46.234]  For instance, they could not be involved in the Kennedy assassination until the state of Texas asked for the FBI's help.
[02:34:46.294 --> 02:34:47.515]  Then they could become involved.
[02:34:47.975 --> 02:34:51.277]  Now that's changed as a result of the Kennedy assassination.
[02:34:51.738 --> 02:34:53.319]  To kill a president is now a federal crime.
[02:34:53.339 --> 02:34:57.241]  They can act immediately, whether the state wants them in the game or not.
[02:34:57.862 --> 02:35:01.103]  In all states with automatic masks, even in much less dramatic cases.
[02:35:02.924 --> 02:35:03.764]  Well, that's the point.
[02:35:03.824 --> 02:35:05.985]  Nobody has been holding the Feds back.
[02:35:06.025 --> 02:35:09.526]  This announcement is just clear predatory intent.
[02:35:09.586 --> 02:35:12.587]  I mean, Jim, it's not just Jim Tucker and Alex Jones saying this.
[02:35:12.727 --> 02:35:19.249]  Even CNN had in its headline a Bush call for military role rebuffed by governors.
[02:35:19.329 --> 02:35:23.111]  And below, two separate times, they say this is martial law.
[02:35:24.491 --> 02:35:26.632]  Yes, 48 of the governors are right.
[02:35:28.088 --> 02:35:33.651]  I suppose Mitt Romney needs to either start drinking coffee or take remedial history lessons.
[02:35:34.712 --> 02:35:47.539]  Well, I mean, for people that don't know, Jim, is it not true that a tell-tale sign that you're living in a really despotic banana republic, or a really serious communist dictatorship, that troops are involved in your daily life?
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:55.824]  Yes, and one reason they can exploit that is the fact that we have two generations of non-readers.
[02:35:56.813 --> 02:35:58.495]  We're good to go.
[02:36:18.616 --> 02:36:22.138]  So, the news coverage on television is very superficial.
[02:36:22.198 --> 02:36:24.419]  Well, actually, they did an analysis.
[02:36:24.499 --> 02:36:28.421]  Local news, about a minute and a half is national news.
[02:36:28.841 --> 02:36:30.282]  Most of that is some divergent.
[02:36:30.602 --> 02:36:34.284]  Then they'll spend a few minutes on how to bake a cake or roast a turkey, you're right.
[02:36:34.484 --> 02:36:37.086]  Then they'll talk about the new rap album that came out.
[02:36:37.346 --> 02:36:37.506]  Yeah.
[02:36:37.566 --> 02:36:41.889]  And then they'll talk about a new store that opened, and absolutely.
[02:36:41.969 --> 02:36:49.033]  And by the way, real research shows people actually want hard news, but the corporations will not give it to people, Jim.
[02:36:49.694 --> 02:36:52.556]  Well, we still have that other troubling problem.
[02:36:52.736 --> 02:37:02.322]  You and I have both met physicians, lawyers, men of letters in their 40s and younger who have never in their life read a book for fun.
[02:37:02.602 --> 02:37:02.982]  Not one.
[02:37:03.443 --> 02:37:06.805]  They've done assigned reading, what reads necessary to pass their courses.
[02:37:07.463 --> 02:37:13.088]  Never read Huckleberry Finn, never read Little Women and had a girlish sniffle when Beth died like I did.
[02:37:13.469 --> 02:37:14.069]  They just didn't read.
[02:37:15.351 --> 02:37:19.314]  I know, and reading... I have to add all the Americans, they do not read even one newspaper a day.
[02:37:19.795 --> 02:37:21.717]  Not three or four, just one newspaper a day.
[02:37:22.197 --> 02:37:22.497]  They don't.
[02:37:23.318 --> 02:37:24.599]  But Jim, aren't they missing out?
[02:37:24.639 --> 02:37:26.841]  I mean, it's addictive, at least for myself.
[02:37:27.302 --> 02:37:31.486]  I mean, I probably read the equivalent, I'm not exaggerating folks, of 15 newspapers a day.
[02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:34.291]  Uh, you know, the actual news sections.
[02:37:34.371 --> 02:37:36.812]  I'm constantly scanning the web, addicted.
[02:37:36.832 --> 02:37:40.114]  At 3 a.m., my wife comes in and says, stop reading your email.
[02:37:40.394 --> 02:37:42.175]  I'm constantly reading legislation.
[02:37:42.475 --> 02:37:43.856]  I love to read the classics.
[02:37:44.156 --> 02:37:46.897]  When I'm on the exercise bike, I listen to books on tape.
[02:37:47.337 --> 02:37:48.238]  All the classics.
[02:37:48.538 --> 02:37:52.200]  It's all about fighting tyranny and corruption and the way people operate.
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:38:10.737]  You know, what goes on, the knowledge, the wisdom, and you're right, this whole brain trust of western civilization is gone, and we just have literally, and I'm not being sardonic, Jim, I don't think I'm that smart, but the general public, as you said, even educated idiots, they are drooling morons.
[02:38:11.157 --> 02:38:14.480]  I mean, they know nothing, Jim, what are we going to do?
[02:38:18.997 --> 02:38:23.681]  We really need to encourage kids to read Turn the Idiot Box Off.
[02:38:24.322 --> 02:38:33.849]  My own two sons, now 40 and 39 years old, have been prolific readers since infancy.
[02:38:34.170 --> 02:38:39.574]  I read Hansel and Gretel and all those childhood tales to them in their cribs with oom-pah excitement.
[02:38:40.495 --> 02:38:42.797]  They have developed a thirst for reading on all subjects.
[02:38:43.297 --> 02:38:45.759]  It's the greatest gift you can give your children, not money.
[02:38:46.536 --> 02:38:47.617]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:39:06.937 --> 02:39:07.717]  And they're real!
[02:39:08.237 --> 02:39:08.397]  Yep.
[02:39:08.818 --> 02:39:10.398]  I mean, you know, that's an incredible thing.
[02:39:10.438 --> 02:39:30.544]  You know history, you know the subterfuge, the sneakiness, the backstabbing, just the incredible grasping of elites, and the secret societies, and the scheming, and then you tell somebody who's got a doctorate in political science that there's government conspiracies, and they laugh at you.
[02:39:31.404 --> 02:39:32.665]  Well, it's always explained to them.
[02:39:32.725 --> 02:39:36.586]  I never have been an advocate of the conspiracy theory.
[02:39:37.245 --> 02:39:39.225]  I do recognize the conspiracy fact.
[02:39:41.586 --> 02:39:42.366]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:44.146 --> 02:39:47.627]  Well, Jim, tell us a little bit more about the book and then we're going to take some calls.
[02:39:48.027 --> 02:39:54.309]  What are some of your favorite parts of the book or some of the adventures that are in the book that you really haven't talked a lot about on air?
[02:39:54.869 --> 02:39:58.770]  Well, there's so many different adventures over the years.
[02:39:58.810 --> 02:40:00.390]  There's so many different ways to do it.
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:05.631]  I remember in one case having found out where the ground crew
[02:40:06.224 --> 02:40:11.228]  And other lower-level staffers like to drink a cold beer after a hard day.
[02:40:11.248 --> 02:40:14.330]  We talked for a while.
[02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:18.934]  They would get very amused by these mysterious things taking place.
[02:40:19.594 --> 02:40:27.500]  So they let me have one of their orange jumpsuits that the landscapers use to rake the leaves and so forth.
[02:40:28.181 --> 02:40:31.943]  And so I raked the leaves and listened to Bilderberg's natter.
[02:40:32.844 --> 02:40:35.246]  And they were also good at stealing stuff for me.
[02:40:36.444 --> 02:40:37.165]  I don't
[02:41:06.844 --> 02:41:07.484]  I don't know.
[02:41:07.504 --> 02:41:07.965]  I don't know.
[02:41:36.955 --> 02:41:41.337]  And just rather curious, you know, I tried to make reservations here for the week.
[02:41:41.377 --> 02:41:44.098]  They told me I'd have to be out by high noon on Wednesday.
[02:41:44.978 --> 02:41:45.378]  Which is true.
[02:41:45.418 --> 02:41:48.259]  I tried to make reservations just to confirm their presence.
[02:41:48.879 --> 02:41:51.820]  And they said, well, they have this big economic meeting going on.
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:53.781]  I said, they must be powerful people.
[02:41:53.841 --> 02:41:55.902]  I understand.
[02:41:56.022 --> 02:41:56.522]  Oh, yes.
[02:41:56.982 --> 02:41:58.683]  By day two, they start to talk a little bit.
[02:41:59.283 --> 02:42:05.645]  And by the end of day two, you know, it's just he's driving on in conversations where the busboys and
[02:42:06.232 --> 02:42:18.410]  The waitresses are going to gather to relax after a day's work and Jackson there and Natter with them and then you end up with sources that will be your eyes and ears.
[02:42:27.778 --> 02:42:28.319]  Absolutely.
[02:42:28.359 --> 02:42:33.263]  In fact, we just got from a Bohemian Grove employee, you might want this, the complete membership list.
[02:42:33.943 --> 02:42:35.184]  We're going to put it on the web soon.
[02:42:35.885 --> 02:42:39.808]  The speakers, the lakeside chats, a lot of what they were pushing and doing.
[02:42:39.868 --> 02:42:41.410]  It's very similar to the Bilderberg Group.
[02:42:42.250 --> 02:42:45.612]  Though the Grove is not even as exclusive as the Bilderberg group.
[02:42:45.892 --> 02:42:51.555]  You'll have a thousand members at the Grove and only a little bit over a hundred at the other facility.
[02:42:52.135 --> 02:43:07.562]  But something interesting you talked about in the past, Jim, is that the people at first don't want to help you, but then when they see how rude and arrogant and out of control and don't look at a Bilderberg person in the eyes, then once they hear this evil, then they're more than willing to spill their guts to you.
[02:43:09.392 --> 02:43:12.733]  Yes, they necessarily have to be very careful because they've been told.
[02:43:13.194 --> 02:43:15.115]  These things happen in every Bilderberg meeting.
[02:43:15.135 --> 02:43:16.615]  They're told in advance.
[02:43:17.276 --> 02:43:22.678]  Certain people, employees, will be furloughed for that period of five days.
[02:43:23.699 --> 02:43:24.860]  No pay, just stay home.
[02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:26.220]  You've not been on staff long enough.
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:33.384]  The others are told that if you reveal anything at all about what transpires,
[02:43:34.184 --> 02:43:37.466]  You will not only be fired here, but you'll be blackballed from the whole industry.
[02:43:37.906 --> 02:43:39.887]  So they're under a great deal of pressure that way.
[02:43:39.927 --> 02:43:42.428]  That's why I always tell them, do not take a chance.
[02:43:42.888 --> 02:43:47.471]  If you're emptying a trash can, you can sell something for me without taking a chance.
[02:43:49.652 --> 02:43:51.433]  You can hear things and you can see things.
[02:43:52.293 --> 02:44:01.177]  And then, since these kids are typically low paid, I'm working to tell them, you're my guest tonight.
[02:44:02.839 --> 02:44:03.479]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:44:16.937 --> 02:44:19.579]  Well, it's fun fighting the New World Order.
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.721]  It's fun spying on them.
[02:44:22.341 --> 02:44:23.622]  It's fun being a rebel.
[02:44:23.722 --> 02:44:25.063]  Join us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:25.083 --> 02:44:29.427]  Join the rebel brigades against the... I mean, these globalists are pieces of filth.
[02:44:29.467 --> 02:44:32.029]  I want to take a few calls here in the last 12, 13 minutes or so, Jim.
[02:44:35.939 --> 02:44:42.206]  I also want to, before you leave us during the break, I want to give out the toll free number for folks that want to subscribe to American Free Press.
[02:44:42.827 --> 02:44:48.233]  But also folks, please go to Infowars.com and get this new book that Jim just put out.
[02:44:48.273 --> 02:44:48.814]  It's excellent.
[02:44:48.834 --> 02:44:49.455]  I can't put it down.
[02:44:49.475 --> 02:44:50.195]  I'm almost done with it.
[02:44:50.736 --> 02:44:51.877]  And we're going to be
[02:44:52.995 --> 02:44:54.156]  We're going to be carrying it.
[02:44:55.016 --> 02:44:55.577]  We are carrying it.
[02:44:55.597 --> 02:44:56.297]  We just got them in.
[02:44:56.777 --> 02:44:58.378]  They're on Infowars.com.
[02:44:58.759 --> 02:45:02.081]  But, Jim, do you think the globalists are going to fall?
[02:45:02.101 --> 02:45:03.682]  I mean, empires always fall.
[02:45:03.962 --> 02:45:05.843]  Do you think Bush is going to get in trouble?
[02:45:05.883 --> 02:45:11.627]  Do you think... It seems like people really are starting to wake up, but what's your prognosis for the next few years?
[02:45:13.928 --> 02:45:17.270]  Well, if we can wake up enough Americans, we will prevail.
[02:45:17.310 --> 02:45:21.753]  We still have, as cryptic as it may be, the power of the ballot box.
[02:45:22.845 --> 02:45:25.627]  We can elect good members of Congress.
[02:45:25.768 --> 02:45:31.792]  We've had some in the past who've denounced Bilderberg and denounced the whole New World Order.
[02:45:32.573 --> 02:45:37.017]  Among them, Jesse Helms of NOPE, but there's other House members over there.
[02:45:37.057 --> 02:45:37.517]  Ron Paul.
[02:45:39.299 --> 02:45:41.781]  Oh yes, and we need more of them in the Congress.
[02:45:46.608 --> 02:45:51.772]  Right now I don't have one with me, a copy of American Free Press, so I could answer your question about how to call toll free.
[02:45:51.972 --> 02:45:54.714]  Oh no, I'm saying we'll do that during the break, because I know you probably had to find it.
[02:45:54.754 --> 02:45:55.815]  I don't have it in front of me either.
[02:45:56.035 --> 02:45:56.856]  Let's take a call.
[02:45:57.176 --> 02:46:01.740]  You know, that's a good solution to support good folks that are in Congress, a few that are there and get more in.
[02:46:02.060 --> 02:46:05.302]  Elizabeth in Maryland, you're on the air with Jim Tucker, an American legend.
[02:46:05.323 --> 02:46:05.703]  Go ahead.
[02:46:06.243 --> 02:46:08.185]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Jim.
[02:46:08.285 --> 02:46:10.166]  Both of you are courageous men.
[02:46:10.587 --> 02:46:14.910]  Alex, you going into Bohemian Grove, and Jim bringing us this wonderful information.
[02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:16.171]  I salute you.
[02:46:17.170 --> 02:46:19.632]  Well, I gotta tell you, I think Milderberg's more dangerous than the Grove.
[02:46:19.672 --> 02:46:22.374]  I mean, they've actually grabbed him quite a few times now.
[02:46:23.435 --> 02:46:25.557]  But you had the Italian police kidnap you, didn't you?
[02:46:26.237 --> 02:46:29.139]  Well, they held me for a few hours and turned me loose.
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:32.082]  I call that kidnapping when they grab you and don't charge you for no reason.
[02:46:32.102 --> 02:46:35.825]  Well, I guess it could be called kidnapping because I wasn't volunteering to go with them.
[02:46:37.286 --> 02:46:39.908]  They took my passport and kept it with them until they let me go.
[02:46:40.535 --> 02:47:01.809]  Well, I think you are a hero, and I want to say something to you, Alex, that I believe that you and Dr. Stan Monteith of Radio Liberty are the preeminent genesis shows for news, for vital news, and I appreciate the extreme amount of documentation and care that you take, and you're up front that you are coming from a Christian
[02:47:03.871 --> 02:47:10.939]  I don't like to see new age ideas being put in in different places, so I salute you for keeping your show the way it is.
[02:47:11.099 --> 02:47:11.599]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:11.659 --> 02:47:15.083]  No, listen, if you deny Christ, He'll deny you.
[02:47:15.444 --> 02:47:16.145]  Absolutely.
[02:47:17.126 --> 02:47:18.227]  I don't deny Christ.
[02:47:18.247 --> 02:47:18.888]  You better believe that.
[02:47:20.239 --> 02:47:20.499]  Yes.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:21.800]  Uh, you know what?
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:28.365]  If you get that spider character a little better, Fatherland Security wants to recruit you for the head of FEMA!
[02:47:28.765 --> 02:47:30.986]  That's right, I was doing a little spider voice imitation.
[02:47:31.006 --> 02:47:31.707]  Thanks, Elizabeth.
[02:47:32.167 --> 02:47:33.108]  Thanks, I gotta jump here.
[02:47:33.148 --> 02:47:33.588]  Thank you.
[02:47:34.009 --> 02:47:38.051]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York, and then, uh, Jim in California.
[02:47:38.071 --> 02:47:38.812]  I think one other caller.
[02:47:38.832 --> 02:47:39.372]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:47:39.772 --> 02:47:40.293]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:47:40.353 --> 02:47:46.157]  As you well are aware of, I'm sure, by this morning's news, the situation we have in New York City with this heightened alert thing.
[02:47:46.798 --> 02:47:50.341]  I found it kind of unusual that they would do that at this moment in time.
[02:47:51.002 --> 02:48:01.592]  In that, two things, you might not know this nationally, but locally at City College, the day before they did this, there was a symposium of very credible people who were in the field of security and so forth.
[02:48:02.132 --> 02:48:05.195]  And every one of them, well granted, all for different reasons,
[02:48:05.876 --> 02:48:10.239]  We're opposed to the bag searches that they were conducting in the subway.
[02:48:10.699 --> 02:48:13.260]  Now, the day after that, of course, this alert is heightened.
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:14.341]  We know about confusion.
[02:48:14.361 --> 02:48:14.821]  Stay there!
[02:48:14.921 --> 02:48:15.242]  Stay there!
[02:48:15.282 --> 02:48:16.782]  You only got Jim Tucker's comment on this.
[02:48:17.783 --> 02:48:21.705]  Well, they won't control the borders, but they're gonna search you on the streets of New York and in the subways.
[02:48:22.226 --> 02:48:25.007]  By trying to find a needle in a haystack, even if the terror threat was real.
[02:48:25.848 --> 02:48:29.470]  And, uh, yeah, no, Wayne Madison, who's our little NSA source,
[02:48:30.234 --> 02:48:34.296]  He's got the poop on this and it is fake, another fake terror alert.
[02:48:34.796 --> 02:48:39.118]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:48:40.759 --> 02:48:43.620]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.461]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:45.801 --> 02:48:50.463]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:50.803 --> 02:48:55.225]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:48:55.665 --> 02:48:59.787]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:00.047 --> 02:49:02.888]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:02.988 --> 02:49:07.649]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:07.849 --> 02:49:12.251]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:12.491 --> 02:49:19.693]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:19.973 --> 02:49:22.393]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:40.043 --> 02:49:45.268]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:45.428 --> 02:49:53.517]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:53.777 --> 02:50:00.824]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:01.764 --> 02:50:08.245]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:08.445 --> 02:50:13.526]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:13.646 --> 02:50:22.508]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:22.788 --> 02:50:26.069]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:28.189 --> 02:50:29.009]  We're good to go!
[02:50:56.457 --> 02:50:57.058]  I think so.
[02:51:16.718 --> 02:51:17.118]  I think so.
[02:51:44.469 --> 02:51:46.370]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:46.850 --> 02:51:49.670]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:50.531 --> 02:51:54.472]  We'll have time to let Ron finish up real quick and then let Alex and Matt have a comment.
[02:51:54.492 --> 02:51:55.532]  We've got to let Jim Tucker go.
[02:51:55.552 --> 02:52:11.436]  You should have heard the discussions we were having during the break about Governor Warner in Virginia when Jim cornered him just a few months ago and got him to tell him that he thinks the next Bilderberg Group meeting is coming up next year in Canada.
[02:52:12.896 --> 02:52:20.019]  Just amazing, and now big BBC headlines about who runs the planet headline of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:20.959 --> 02:52:23.400]  Going from the last six years, it doesn't exist.
[02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:26.021]  You're crazy if you talk about it on national TV.
[02:52:26.061 --> 02:52:27.342]  The TV specials about it.
[02:52:27.782 --> 02:52:31.143]  That's got to make the Bilderberg Group members mad, Jim.
[02:52:31.683 --> 02:52:32.304]  I hope so.
[02:52:33.444 --> 02:52:34.865]  I'd be disappointed if not.
[02:52:36.225 --> 02:52:38.746]  But Limbaugh still denies it even exists.
[02:52:38.806 --> 02:52:39.747]  I've heard him say that.
[02:52:41.733 --> 02:52:43.614]  Yes, he's right on some issues.
[02:52:43.654 --> 02:52:45.234]  I think he's a little bit superficial.
[02:52:47.856 --> 02:52:52.317]  I don't know what other interests he has in defending Bilderberg or denying their existence.
[02:52:53.598 --> 02:52:56.099]  Well, I think he's there to just kind of put conservatives to sleep.
[02:52:56.699 --> 02:53:03.462]  Well, you have to be a cab driver or truck driver to listen to him for three hours a day, which I cannot do, of course.
[02:53:05.102 --> 02:53:07.203]  I don't say that facetiously.
[02:53:07.223 --> 02:53:11.245]  A guy driving a truck all day, I can understand why it would be fun to listen to his three-hour show.
[02:53:11.934 --> 02:53:12.014]  Yeah.
[02:53:12.034 --> 02:53:13.034]  Like a guy driving a cab.
[02:53:13.855 --> 02:53:14.455]  Absolutely.
[02:53:14.535 --> 02:53:18.737]  Give folks the number to get a subscription to American Free Press.
[02:53:20.017 --> 02:53:21.118]  Well, with pleasure.
[02:53:23.179 --> 02:53:28.201]  Call toll-free 1-800... Bear with me, this type is very small.
[02:53:31.922 --> 02:53:33.223]  Good lord, so hard to read.
[02:53:33.643 --> 02:53:35.143]  Not that I'm old.
[02:53:35.163 --> 02:53:35.403]  1-8... 1-8-8-8... 8-8-8-6...
[02:53:42.778 --> 02:53:52.946]  9, 5, 6, 3, 8, 7.
[02:53:48.463 --> 02:53:52.946]  The last four numbers are still the word news.
[02:53:53.447 --> 02:53:56.969]  Okay, you can't miss that and it's a great newspaper folks should get it.
[02:53:57.710 --> 02:54:04.615]  Answering Ron's question, these constant terror alerts, this constant fear-mongering, we need to search your bags.
[02:54:05.396 --> 02:54:06.117]  Your take on that?
[02:54:09.189 --> 02:54:10.630]  A couple of things are funny about it.
[02:54:10.970 --> 02:54:13.030]  First of all, random searches.
[02:54:14.031 --> 02:54:14.831]  One out of ten.
[02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:19.793]  So the odds, no matter what you look like, are ten to one that the Mad Bomber is going to get through.
[02:54:20.513 --> 02:54:26.435]  Now suppose they stop the Mad Bomber and he's got the bomb in his suitcase and say, we have to search your suitcase.
[02:54:26.955 --> 02:54:28.075]  All he has to say is no.
[02:54:28.475 --> 02:54:31.176]  It means he cannot get on the train, but he walks away.
[02:54:31.196 --> 02:54:37.078]  Then of course this nonsense about we will not profile.
[02:54:39.069 --> 02:54:46.291]  Well, yeah, it's like if a black guy's robbed a bank, they don't look for little old white ladies.
[02:54:46.751 --> 02:54:58.455]  But it gets so silly that some students at one of those Ivy League schools were outraged because a girl was raped and she described her rapist as about 20 years old.
[02:54:59.474 --> 02:55:01.096]  I hear you joking about Clinic.
[02:55:21.371 --> 02:55:23.353]  As they say, Planet X, but it has a name.
[02:55:23.413 --> 02:55:24.253]  It's called Nibiru.
[02:55:24.313 --> 02:55:26.555]  Yeah, and it was supposed to kill us two years ago.
[02:55:26.615 --> 02:55:27.656]  No, no, no, but listen.
[02:55:27.896 --> 02:55:29.137]  It's not showing up.
[02:55:29.337 --> 02:55:30.138]  It does exist.
[02:55:30.158 --> 02:55:31.639]  It's like a dark thought.
[02:55:32.359 --> 02:55:39.845]  And I'm just saying, if we have presidents and leaders who are acting in occult rituals, who is their leader?
[02:55:40.605 --> 02:55:42.907]  What's so strange about thinking about reptilians?
[02:55:43.468 --> 02:55:44.448]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:55:44.809 --> 02:55:46.310]  That's quite a way to end the program.
[02:55:47.071 --> 02:55:49.416]  Well, we can think about all kinds of stuff we can't prove all day.
[02:55:49.456 --> 02:55:51.320]  We can climb beanstalks to heaven.
[02:55:51.921 --> 02:55:53.925]  But, Jim, final comments?
[02:55:54.807 --> 02:55:57.292]  Well, thank you very much for having me and still a lot of books.
[02:55:57.992 --> 02:55:59.112]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[02:55:59.152 --> 02:55:59.533]  Take care.
[02:55:59.773 --> 02:56:00.033]  Thank you.
[02:56:00.673 --> 02:56:01.773]  Always a true gentleman.
[02:56:01.793 --> 02:56:03.174]  We always appreciate him coming on.
[02:56:03.214 --> 02:56:11.116]  We are carrying his new book, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, at Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:56:11.436 --> 02:56:15.618]  And I'll see you coming up Sunday and Monday at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:56:15.858 --> 02:56:17.418]  We're going to show my new film.
[02:56:19.959 --> 02:56:24.200]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[02:56:30.012 --> 02:56:30.114]  Yes.
