[00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:07.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:09.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:11.253]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:12.915]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:17.517]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:34.147]  Well, I'm fired up today.
[00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.388]  It is already December 5, 2005.
[00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:36.628]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:40.571]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.262 --> 00:01:01.589]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:18.543]  All four of the sites have a lot of the same news, but a lot of different news and original news that you'll only find on the individual sites, so be sure and check them all out on a daily basis, and we appreciate all of you tuning in and caring about freedom and caring about the fight against the new world
[00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:21.418]  Odor, as some have called it.
[00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:22.959]  No guests today.
[00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:26.601]  I just want to cover news and take calls.
[00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:30.103]  A lot of times I get in here and I just say, you know what?
[00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.945]  Cancel the guests.
[00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:37.768]  And we have a lot of great guests lined up for you, but I just cancel them because I want to cover news.
[00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:39.129]  I want to rant and rave.
[00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.930]  I want to pontificate.
[00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.311]  I want to take your phone calls.
[00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.406]  And we're going to move quickly through your calls today.
[00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:48.307]  I'm getting better and better at actually taking your calls and moving through them quickly.
[00:01:48.787 --> 00:01:50.987]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:51.788 --> 00:02:03.911]  Any news item, any issue, anything you wish to discuss, and if you disagree with me, you go straight to the head of the line.
[00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:04.191]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:12.474]  Fossil fuel theory takes hit with NASA finding new study shows methane on Saturn's moon Titan not biological.
[00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:16.164]  There are thousands of studies.
[00:02:16.204 --> 00:02:30.035]  I mean, literally, I've seen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and seen, you know, many hundreds others mentioned by our government, other governments, private firms, where they're finding oil, gas, that is clearly not fossil.
[00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:37.701]  That is clearly not from plankton or dinosaurs or Easter monkeys.
[00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:43.105]  New study shows methane on Saturn's moon, Titan, not biological.
[00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:48.318]  Ejecting masses of methane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.702]  Tamiflu, useless against avian flu, we told you this months ago.
[00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:59.809]  But a doctor who has treated 41 victims of viruses, we place no importance on this drug.
[00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.051]  Rumsfeld and others own it.
[00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:04.874]  You're going to hear it's good for you on the nightly news.
[00:03:05.534 --> 00:03:06.015]  Shut up!
[00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:10.699]  It doesn't matter if the last five years the flu shots everybody goes out and gets.
[00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.520]  They know at the time does not cover even that year's flu.
[00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.341]  People are lining up to get this one.
[00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.622]  So it's just, just shut up!
[00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:18.283]  Okay?
[00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:20.224]  We don't want scientific fact.
[00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:20.984]  We want to feel good.
[00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:23.305]  Like George Bush is a conservative.
[00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:25.206]  It's not true, but it just doesn't matter.
[00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:28.428]  Deadly bacteria spreading through U.S.
[00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:29.669]  population.
[00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.890]  Now, this is something you're never going to really hear about on the nightly news.
[00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.391]  This is something you really got to worry about.
[00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.929]  So we're going to get to that a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.414]  Congress considers stripping homeowners of state protections.
[00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:47.704]  Yeah, you thought Congress was moving to protect you from the Supreme Court ruling?
[00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:49.166]  No, this is an establishment.
[00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:52.594]  When they do something at that level, it's done for a reason.
[00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:54.755]  And you may have lots of pontificating.
[00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:57.416]  It's like Hillary's against Bush, but she loves the war.
[00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:17.343]  Well, the Republicans are very angry at the Supreme Court, seven of them are Republican appointed, by the way, of the nine, about saying we don't own our own property, but they'll pass a little resolution saying we believe in free speech and property and the Second Amendment, but then they'll move forward attacking all of those pillars of liberty and freedom.
[00:04:18.744 --> 00:04:24.148]  And it's the same here, they're moving ahead just openly stripping at the state level.
[00:04:24.168 --> 00:04:29.812]  So Congress is going to pass a law knowing after your land use and your ownership itself.
[00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:32.514]  300 CIA flights landed in Europe.
[00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:34.015]  Getting more details of that.
[00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:35.376]  Hillary's military offensive.
[00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:38.259]  Clinton's hawkish stance is a two-edged political sword.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.562]  Al-Qaeda number three killed by a CIA spy plane.
[00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.785]  Is that the fifth time number five, I mean number three's been killed?
[00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.492]  And just so much more, folks.
[00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:52.396]  It's just all very important.
[00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.579]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.566]  And your calls as well on this Monday edition of InfoWars.
[00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:09.566]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:14.592]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:20.460]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.204]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:32.590]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.154]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:39.837]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.057 --> 00:05:46.763]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:11.144]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.385 --> 00:06:20.412]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:22.613]  Into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:28.677]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:35.562]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:42.587]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:44.648]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:46.970]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:05.611]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:11.196]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:12.937]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:07:12.997 --> 00:07:15.239]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.983]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:07:19.343 --> 00:07:21.323]  And they can do it without due process.
[00:07:21.383 --> 00:07:24.844]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries.
[00:07:24.984 --> 00:07:28.305]  And now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.

[00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:06.335]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:08.076]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.776 --> 00:08:09.896]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:11.356]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:12.977]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:17.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.858 --> 00:08:21.998]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:26.079]  It's Monday, boys and girls.
[00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.780]  Thank you so much for joining us, all the folks across the continents.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.561]  From Asia, to Europe, to Africa, to South America.
[00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:42.389]  North America, the ships at sea, thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:51.014]  We're going to have open phones 1-800-259-9231 for the entire three hours of this transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:52.035 --> 00:08:55.797]  In resistance to tyranny in defense of liberty.
[00:08:56.197 --> 00:09:00.440]  Coming up later, something interesting happened last week, last Friday.
[00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:18.261]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was up there with Donald Rumsfeld, and Rumsfeld started talking about how we're not behind the torture, because there's lots of different countries that are there, and when something bad does happen, why we row.
[00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:25.724]  It's not really our job to do anything, and it's not our job to do anything if the Iraqis are torturing people.
[00:09:26.604 --> 00:09:28.225]  And the general,
[00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:35.830]  Marine Corps Commandant, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says, uh, no sir, we do have to do something.
[00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.913]  Because you see, this is still all illegal.
[00:09:39.973 --> 00:09:45.418]  This is still all serious felony, we're talking life in prison crimes, okay?
[00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:56.347]  And just because President Bush says he's above the law, and the Attorney General says he's above the law, the federal laws, the state laws, the international laws, the human laws, God's laws,
[00:09:57.353 --> 00:10:02.736]  Basic common sense laws, the laws of the universe, are still in play here.
[00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:14.723]  And so Rumsfeld may think he can get up and talk about how it's not their job to stop somebody torturing someone, but in the real world that's just not true.
[00:10:16.184 --> 00:10:20.386]  And I know that Karl Rove says that they're above the law,
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.522]  I know that Karl Rove says that they can do whatever they want.
[00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:28.965]  I know Karl Rove has openly told the New York Times that they control reality.
[00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:30.706]  But that is not true.
[00:10:31.027 --> 00:10:41.494]  And people come into my studio, now that it's semi-public over here at this bookstore I'll be opening sometime in the near future at a still undisclosed location in Austin, Texas.
[00:10:41.514 --> 00:10:43.595]  I just haven't gotten the bookstore ready yet.
[00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:47.818]  And they say, why do you have that star chart hanging on the wall?
[00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:52.928]  And they joke, they say, what are you like Ronald Reagan?
[00:10:52.988 --> 00:10:53.989]  Is that astrology?
[00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.393]  And no, it's not an astrology chart.
[00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:04.741]  I was in one of those poster shops many, many years ago, actually back in college.
[00:11:06.162 --> 00:11:09.125]  And I saw it and it was just so pretty.
[00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:19.371]  Kind of a figure eight with the northern and southern hemispheres as viewed from the North Pole and the South Pole.
[00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:25.432]  And there's also then a diagram very nicely done.
[00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:26.632]  It actually glows in the dark.
[00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:29.052]  In the past it hung in my bedroom.
[00:11:29.872 --> 00:11:33.773]  My wife doesn't fit with the decor so it's now in my office.
[00:11:34.573 --> 00:11:37.554]  And it's got the celestial
[00:11:38.935 --> 00:11:39.655]  PlanetSphere.
[00:11:39.936 --> 00:11:42.457]  It's got some of the near galaxies to us.
[00:11:43.717 --> 00:11:47.299]  In a larger description, it's also got our own Milky Way.
[00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:50.160]  And I like to look at it.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.663]  I'm thinking I'm going to order from NASA some of the Hubble photographs of galaxy clusters.
[00:11:57.423 --> 00:11:58.744]  And in one small view,
[00:12:00.056 --> 00:12:13.342]  In one photograph that Hubble has taken, there are several hundred million galaxies, and Hubble has photographed the entire night sky around Earth from its view.
[00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:29.189]  Just taking photos of dark matter alone and using computers to count the galaxies, there's over 200 billion galaxies from all of the Hubble photographs as it took pictures of the night sky in a grid pattern.
[00:12:29.864 --> 00:12:31.164]  Over the last few years.
[00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:36.146]  Well, now they're shutting Hubble down, but I guess it was over the last decade or so.
[00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:44.988]  And you're, what does this have to do with torture, what does it have to do with open borders, what does it have to do with the price of gold, the price of tea in China?
[00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:47.269]  This.
[00:12:48.749 --> 00:12:55.491]  That reminds me, and it reminded me at the time I bought it, and it reminds me at the time I look at it today.
[00:12:57.225 --> 00:13:10.330]  Of just how small we really are, how transitory we are, how short our lives are, how wonderful and blessed our lives are, how enchanted everything really is.
[00:13:12.531 --> 00:13:22.495]  I mean, just in the view of the Milky Way on this primitive little poster, there are millions and millions of stars.
[00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:26.057]  Just a tiny snapshot
[00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:32.950]  The stars form fogs, there's so many, to where you can't even differentiate them.
[00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:55.018]  One little quadrant of the Milky Way in our own galaxy, not just the dark matter where the telescopes take photos in between the stars out to galaxies beyond us, but just one little area of the Milky Way has hundreds of millions of stars with hundreds of millions upon millions of orbiting planets.
[00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:08.855]  Imagine the mystery and the majesty of Jupiter, and Saturn, and Uranus, and Pluto, and Venus, and Mercury, and Mars, and all of it!
[00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.077]  Just in our little tiny solar system!
[00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:24.529]  So you got these people fighting and killing and backstabbing so they can strut around on the red carpet, doing everything they can, pulling out every stop they can, so they can strut around like peacocks and act cool.
[00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:28.931]  People rising and then the falling of empires.
[00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.752]  It's just nothing in the scheme of time.
[00:14:31.812 --> 00:14:38.175]  It's nothing in the scope and scale of the universe and God's creation.
[00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:41.437]  We can see the handiwork
[00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:46.378]  We can see the mind of God in the firmament, in the night sky.
[00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:50.140]  And so I look at that and it just humbles me.
[00:14:50.701 --> 00:14:52.702]  And we all need to be a little bit more humble.
[00:14:54.963 --> 00:15:03.047]  There's people that will shell their souls just for a little bit of temporal power on this plane.
[00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:11.432]  There are women all over the West who knowingly buy collagen for melted down dead prisoners and babies.
[00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.039]  Knowingly!
[00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.800]  It's known, and they do it.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.020]  Well, I just want to look beautiful.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.581]  There are people who will rob banks so they can rob a fancy car.
[00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:37.405]  There are cops who will violate the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, stomp on freedoms, stomp on liberties, for absolutely no reason.
[00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:45.500]  Just to get $35,000 a year and exercise a little bit of power because they get off on it.
[00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:54.067]  And I'm not saying all police, but the police work for this corrupt government, they're violating our rights in a systematic fashion, and openly saying they want to violate them more.
[00:15:55.148 --> 00:15:58.170]  Police chiefs all over the country are calling for banning guns outright.
[00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:08.476]  And so they've declared themselves enemies of the people, and so the police that aren't for this should speak up and step out from amongst the enemy and declare themselves on the people's side.
[00:16:08.796 --> 00:16:10.137]  Oh, I couldn't do that, I'd get fired.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.202]  It's a con, it's an illusion, it's a fraud.
[00:16:16.522 --> 00:16:26.069]  You think you hold on to something, you think you get something by gripping it and lusting after it and fighting for it, and really you lose your life because you tried to save it.
[00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.953]  Because we're a nation of cowards.
[00:16:30.997 --> 00:16:32.740]  We are evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.682]  Look at the fruits.
[00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.694]  Hogs to the slaughter.
[00:16:39.234 --> 00:16:43.617]  No one in the history of the world has been in as great a per capita debt.
[00:16:44.157 --> 00:16:46.759]  No one has been more unhealthy.
[00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:51.181]  No one has been more manifestly decadent.
[00:16:51.622 --> 00:16:58.105]  No one has simulated in their own minds, which is the same thing as doing it in the real world, murders and rapes and killings.
[00:16:58.125 --> 00:16:58.846]  Just look at the TV.
[00:17:00.922 --> 00:17:04.506]  No one has ever distributed depleted uranium over much of the earth.
[00:17:04.986 --> 00:17:12.234]  No one has ever dumped hundreds of millions of gallons of nerve gas into the ocean, just happily dumping it off barges.
[00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:17.800]  No one has ever taken almost the entire
[00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:26.596]  genetic line of food crops and mutated and warped them and basically destroyed them and then released them in the open air.
[00:17:27.057 --> 00:17:28.237]  It is suicide!
[00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:30.799]  We are committing mass hairy carry.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.321]  We are committing mass seppuku.
[00:17:37.024 --> 00:17:37.464]  Right now.
[00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:42.488]  In front of everyone.
[00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:49.603]  Because you do reap what you sow, and what comes around does go around.
[00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:54.327]  And I'm convinced, you know, you talk about these evil people, why are they always so self-destructive?
[00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:56.909]  Because that's the nature of humankind.
[00:17:57.209 --> 00:18:06.917]  If you decide to take that dark path, you will destroy yourself and everybody around you, because deep down your coding that God gave you is still there, and there's a self-destruct mechanism built in.
[00:18:08.439 --> 00:18:09.740]  That's why now I don't hate
[00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.111]  Evil New World Order masters.
[00:18:12.171 --> 00:18:13.451]  I hate the sin they engage in.
[00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:14.632]  I hate the programs they build.
[00:18:15.172 --> 00:18:19.214]  But I actually, in a way, feel sorry for them because they're such pathetic wretches.
[00:18:19.794 --> 00:18:21.535]  They're so incredibly unhappy.
[00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:23.176]  They're so fallen.
[00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:26.877]  Fallen even further than those of us that at least know we're fallen.
[00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:30.819]  They want to be more fallen.
[00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:32.560]  In a more fallen state.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.500]  More fallen nature.
[00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:34.781]  They revel in it.
[00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:35.581]  They love it.
[00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:36.862]  They love the darkness.
[00:18:39.668 --> 00:18:46.273]  And I'm preaching here and I've got a lot of news to cover and a lot of calls to take today.
[00:18:46.353 --> 00:18:49.195]  It's just that I look up at the night sky.
[00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:55.019]  I look at the poster on my wall of the northern and southern views of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.351]  And I realize what small, little creatures we are.
[00:19:02.471 --> 00:19:04.972]  How the Earth isn't even a speck of dust.
[00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:08.153]  It isn't even a molecule in a speck of dust.
[00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:16.797]  It is just a fraction in a neutron in an atom spinning around a molecule.
[00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:19.898]  I mean, we are nothing.
[00:19:20.258 --> 00:19:20.778]  Nothing.
[00:19:22.424 --> 00:19:27.886]  And everywhere I go I just see the beauty, the trees, the sky, God's creation.
[00:19:28.186 --> 00:19:29.346]  It's all around us.
[00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:30.667]  It's magnificent.
[00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:32.668]  These people don't even want to see it.
[00:19:33.028 --> 00:19:36.549]  They're busy inside watching Fox television, watching CNN.
[00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:46.412]  They're busy running around just totally blinded, totally... They have spellers on them where they can't even see what they're in.
[00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:48.193]  They can't even
[00:19:49.312 --> 00:19:53.777]  With our limited consciousness that we have, they're even blinded to that.
[00:19:54.598 --> 00:19:57.702]  They're missing out on the most fabulous things.
[00:19:57.782 --> 00:19:59.424]  It's just so sad.
[00:20:03.428 --> 00:20:10.036]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?

[00:21:58.336 --> 00:22:00.039]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.386]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:22:08.522 --> 00:22:12.163]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.

[00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:12.333]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:23.096]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:23:23.997 --> 00:23:30.579]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:40.403]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:42.484]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:42.824]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:42.844 --> 00:23:43.004]  Call now.
[00:23:43.024 --> 00:23:48.387]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:24:17.142 --> 00:24:27.785]  The good news is only 28% of the American people, even in mainline establishment polls, now believe the war is good.
[00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:41.170]  So you see Hillary and Bill Clinton and Chuckie Schumer and Lieberman and, of course, the former Secretary of State for Nixon.
[00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.991]  All of them, Henry Kissinger, piling onto the seesaw.
[00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:50.090]  Because we've pushed the seesaw down on our end, and so they're all showing their true colors.
[00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:54.835]  You see, on the surface, when it's close, they'll keep their little acts going on.
[00:24:55.976 --> 00:24:59.259]  Well, they give each other awards and vacation together and intermarry.
[00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:02.602]  The best example of this is Mary Madeline and Carvel.
[00:25:03.483 --> 00:25:05.685]  One is a neocon working in the White House.
[00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:08.507]  The other is the chief Clinton strategist.
[00:25:09.088 --> 00:25:10.129]  But they're married together.
[00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:11.230]  It's like the Bennett brothers.
[00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:25.985]  And on the weekend, when one's not prancing around being the liberal lawyer for Bill Clinton and the other's the good conservative lawyer, and the good conservative, oh, writing books of virtue when he's not out with his racehorses, or spending, you know, what was it, half a million in a day gambling?
[00:25:26.045 --> 00:25:27.565]  I mean, just foaming at the mouth.
[00:25:28.086 --> 00:25:30.266]  A literal gambling addict.
[00:25:30.327 --> 00:25:32.207]  And I'm not judging the guy, folks.
[00:25:32.748 --> 00:25:34.348]  I'm just, they're total hypocrites.
[00:25:35.429 --> 00:25:38.370]  And there's a lot of these husband-and-wife teams, brother-brother teams.
[00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.291]  The Clintons and the Bushes, CIA,
[00:25:42.328 --> 00:25:43.149]  I mean, Bush Sr.
[00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:49.075]  was CIA in 1947, Clinton was CIA, a lot of evidence shows recruited out of high school.
[00:25:49.496 --> 00:25:52.358]  We know by the time he gets to Georgetown he was.
[00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:53.600]  That's admitted.
[00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:59.846]  Just like Putin's KGB's now admitted Blair's MI6, back when he was a zit-faced guitar player.
[00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:02.729]  Socialist, you know, causing trouble at the universities.
[00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.452]  And this is how they do it.
[00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:13.791]  And the average guy driving along with a George W. sticker right now, he's just, I don't believe it, that's a liberal lie.
[00:26:14.431 --> 00:26:17.292]  Well, buddy, I've done my homework, I know what I'm talking about, and you don't.
[00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:26.095]  And we're losing our Second Amendment, we're losing our sovereignty, because people like you don't really want to defend this country, you just want to feel good.
[00:26:26.615 --> 00:26:28.155]  Well, go ahead and feel good then!
[00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.336]  You've got a rude awakening coming with this economy.
[00:26:32.088 --> 00:26:38.473]  And the thing is, you believe all the propaganda, even when you're living in a shack, you'll think, well I'm the one, I just am down on my luck, the economy's really great.
[00:26:39.894 --> 00:26:47.620]  The TV said, we'll get back, we'll talk to Ken, Jacob, Jason, Michael, and who's that last caller in the queue from Texas?
[00:26:48.821 --> 00:26:50.783]  Jeanette, and then others that are holding as well.
[00:26:51.363 --> 00:26:53.345]  So, we'll get to everybody.
[00:26:53.365 --> 00:27:00.991]  I want to get into this Drudge Report, Jerusalem Post sensationalized story about nuclear Iran.
[00:27:02.347 --> 00:27:04.388]  They're going to have a bomb in the next month, and they're going to kill us.
[00:27:04.448 --> 00:27:04.808]  It's over.
[00:27:04.908 --> 00:27:06.029]  Folks, we've got to attack them now.
[00:27:06.869 --> 00:27:16.955]  And the very same person over in England, their foreign secretary, Straw, who was saying that in 45 minutes Saddam will kill us, he's now saying Iran's going to kill us.
[00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:18.876]  It's just going to happen in the next month.
[00:27:19.276 --> 00:27:21.677]  They've got the nuclear missiles, they've got bombs, it's over.
[00:27:22.198 --> 00:27:24.079]  Of course, it's totally admitted to be a fraud.
[00:27:24.739 --> 00:27:29.922]  MI6 own documents say 10 years, CIA 10 years, total fraud, total lies.
[00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:31.696]  But, uh, it doesn't stop.
[00:27:31.756 --> 00:27:33.277]  See, they keep saying nuclear, nuclear.
[00:27:33.357 --> 00:27:37.539]  That means they can have a power plant in the next year.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.321]  I mean, UT can have two nuclear reactors.
[00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:43.542]  I'm sorry, I always said they had one.
[00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:44.663]  They have two here in town.
[00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:46.904]  No one guards it, by the way.
[00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:50.606]  I've been talking about this for years, and finally there was an MSNBC story about it.
[00:27:50.626 --> 00:27:56.609]  The border's wide open, and I gotta have police pull me over to Checkpoint, but no one's guarding a nuclear reactor in North Austin.
[00:27:57.566 --> 00:27:59.087]  And a good-sized one, by the way.
[00:27:59.147 --> 00:28:02.510]  And I don't want to hear that, well, why are you talking about it then?
[00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:05.833]  Just next time a cop pulls you over and wants to search your car, go, uh, sir?
[00:28:06.613 --> 00:28:07.254]  Actually, you better not.
[00:28:07.294 --> 00:28:09.316]  They'll have you on the news just saying you were going to do something to it.
[00:28:09.356 --> 00:28:10.356]  That's how dumb it's gotten.
[00:28:10.937 --> 00:28:13.639]  If you get sarcastic, go, sir, why don't you go guard the nuclear power plant?
[00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:15.040]  I got me one!
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.682]  He mentioned the nuclear power plant!
[00:28:19.043 --> 00:28:19.884]  What are you talking about?
[00:28:19.904 --> 00:28:21.125]  There ain't one of those around here!
[00:28:21.145 --> 00:28:22.786]  Uh, yeah, there is.
[00:28:22.846 --> 00:28:24.208]  It's just, I'm tired of it!
[00:28:24.548 --> 00:28:25.729]  Willful ignorance!
[00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:40.256]  You know, the police are going to be running around randomly from New York to Dallas, Texas now they're saying, to Miami, to Detroit, to Chicago, to L.A.
[00:28:40.736 --> 00:28:49.301]  Randomly, just hundreds of police show up in black uniforms and just randomly under federal grants start randomly searching people and demanding everyone's I.D.
[00:28:49.321 --> 00:28:53.623]  I mean, there's a real terror threat.
[00:28:53.643 --> 00:28:54.984]  You better stop these illegal aliens.
[00:28:55.264 --> 00:28:57.886]  You better stop these lamas just pouring across the northern and southern border.
[00:28:58.593 --> 00:29:01.216]  You better go guard the nuclear power plants!
[00:29:01.276 --> 00:29:02.417]  I mean, give me a break!
[00:29:03.579 --> 00:29:11.707]  They got cops guarding the courthouses, guarding the state houses, guarding them all as if it's going to stop a terrorist if they really attack.
[00:29:13.129 --> 00:29:14.430]  But have they built barricades?
[00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.415]  Have they built a little machine gun nest at all the nuclear power plants?
[00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:23.547]  Oh, they'll have one or two around the country and then put on a big fanfare for you.
[00:29:23.787 --> 00:29:27.368]  Meanwhile, there's hundreds of experimental plants all over the country!
[00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:28.588]  And they haven't done a thing!
[00:29:28.748 --> 00:29:30.309]  My point is, it's all a fraud!
[00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:32.209]  It's about training you to be a slave!
[00:29:32.489 --> 00:29:33.849]  And I don't want to hear it anymore!
[00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.150]  Next time they pull you over to Checkpoint, what do you want to search me for?
[00:29:38.631 --> 00:29:40.171]  Things have changed since 9-11.
[00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:40.871]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:42.191]  You've gotten even stupider.
[00:29:42.211 --> 00:29:45.532]  Alright, I really am ranting.
[00:29:46.993 --> 00:29:48.433]  Come back, take calls, get in more news.
[00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:48.873]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:54.610]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.552 --> 00:29:58.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:08.787]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:30:08.947 --> 00:30:21.839]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:23.860]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.481]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:31.542]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:30:31.782 --> 00:30:36.744]  Whatever it is you seek, Dango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:30:37.024 --> 00:30:38.745]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:42.986]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotion.
[00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:45.087]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[00:30:45.247 --> 00:30:47.828]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.831]  I think so.
[00:31:01.954 --> 00:31:07.180]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:15.409]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:22.718]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:23.659 --> 00:31:30.164]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:30.344 --> 00:31:35.428]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.548 --> 00:31:44.436]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:31:44.696 --> 00:31:47.978]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.083]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:04.432]  Government is best what governs least.
[00:32:04.972 --> 00:32:06.293]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:09.436]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:32:09.876 --> 00:32:12.519]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:19.224]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:32:19.224 --> 00:32:19.945]  We're good to go.
[00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:41.708]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:32:41.888 --> 00:32:42.248]  Have you?
[00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:44.310]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:32:44.771 --> 00:32:48.554]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:32:49.695 --> 00:32:52.518]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:32:52.998 --> 00:32:54.039]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.781]  Osama bin Ferdinand.
[00:32:56.221 --> 00:32:59.865]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:33:10.158 --> 00:33:13.799]  We're going to go to Ken, Jacob, Jason, Michael, Jeanette, and others.
[00:33:13.879 --> 00:33:15.939]  Call for your number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:23.821]  Coming up, I want to play this little clip of Rumsfeld last week, late last week, being contradicted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:30.462]  Because Rumsfeld's up there just saying, we don't have to stop torture, even if we see it happening.
[00:33:30.482 --> 00:33:32.623]  And he's like, no, that's not true, sir, we do.
[00:33:33.383 --> 00:33:34.763]  And that's a spin right there.
[00:33:34.843 --> 00:33:38.124]  It's our corrupt government, again, hijacked by criminals,
[00:33:38.832 --> 00:33:42.234]  Bill Clinton, all of them, all criminals, doesn't matter who's in, it's all the same club.
[00:33:43.714 --> 00:33:46.776]  Doing this, training him to do this, but that's coming up.
[00:33:46.856 --> 00:33:51.478]  Also, I'm just going to play a small segment of this, just a little bit to analyze it and comment on it.
[00:33:51.538 --> 00:33:53.939]  Limbaugh on kidnapping a peace activist in Iraq.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.961]  I'm telling you folks, there's a part of me that likes this.
[00:33:59.975 --> 00:34:10.937]  Yeah, there's been a lot of peace activists get arrested by overweight middle-aged men and they're so sloppy you'll even hear British and American accents in the background and they blow women's heads off.
[00:34:13.237 --> 00:34:14.938]  It's really used for good propaganda.
[00:34:15.598 --> 00:34:23.839]  Now, I have no doubt that in a lot of cases these peace activists really are spies.
[00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:29.080]  They really are getting intel for real insurgents, real rebels.
[00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:37.596]  And so they just go, go pick that bleeper up and we're going to get some propaganda out of this, blow her head off, saw their head off, right in front of everybody.
[00:34:39.097 --> 00:34:42.820]  Oh, that guy gave some intelligence to somebody for exchange for some money?
[00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:44.261]  Get him and kill him.
[00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:47.304]  Now that's the twisted logic they use.
[00:34:47.324 --> 00:34:49.445]  They're not so outright overtly evil.
[00:34:49.906 --> 00:34:53.389]  Most of them, usually somebody they're killing has done something.
[00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:55.110]  I'm not defending them.
[00:34:55.982 --> 00:35:03.727]  I'm not, and then in other cases you've got real Arabs, real Persians, really kidnapping people, and generally if it's the real ones they let them go.
[00:35:05.828 --> 00:35:07.089]  And normally it's a soldier.
[00:35:07.289 --> 00:35:09.650]  It is not some peace activist.
[00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:15.434]  I mean it's like that German lady, she's been there 15 years, married an Iraqi, and they just marched her out and killed her.
[00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:18.676]  And witnesses, it was even in major Iraqi papers,
[00:35:20.203 --> 00:35:30.148]  Witnesses saw white men, they don't even hide it, they'll have white guys pull up in army fatigues, they'll go pick them up and go kill them, put a mask over their head, and it's over.
[00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.270]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:44.976]  And so, Lumbaugh goes on to say, well this could even be fake, this could be the peace activist pulling a stunt, posing with Arab terrorists, and you know, frankly, that is true.
[00:35:45.672 --> 00:35:46.572]  It could be that, too.
[00:35:46.712 --> 00:35:52.334]  I mean, we're supposed to, in wartime, have a Machiavellian view, and know that everybody can pull these tricks.
[00:35:52.394 --> 00:35:56.296]  The point is, don't ever believe what you're just told on the surface.
[00:35:56.796 --> 00:36:10.140]  Look at it objectively, analyze it through the lens, look for key areas, and then over time, unfortunately, we've got about a 97 or so percent accuracy rate on our analysis, because it's not that hard.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.761]  The globalists are just, and I say unfortunately, because I wish we weren't right.
[00:36:14.142 --> 00:36:15.062]  Stuff's really bad, folks.
[00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:20.099]  We've just seen the globalists do stuff so many times, they have like templates they follow.
[00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:23.702]  Attack Pattern Delta, go now.
[00:36:23.722 --> 00:36:27.125]  I mean, it's just, they're very predictable.
[00:36:28.046 --> 00:36:30.808]  It only works on just dumbed down, gullible people.
[00:36:31.269 --> 00:36:33.090]  You know how stupid the general public is now?
[00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.113]  I mean, you can't even hold conversations with half the population.
[00:36:36.713 --> 00:36:41.357]  They are literally just in a TV-watching haze.
[00:36:42.238 --> 00:36:43.279]  And if you want to talk about
[00:36:45.049 --> 00:36:54.171]  Fancy clothes or food or cars, they might be able to get a twinkle in their eye and engage you in some half-baked conversation.
[00:36:54.891 --> 00:37:02.553]  You want to talk to them about basically anything else, they are grunting, lobotomized individuals.
[00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:05.553]  And I'm not trying to be sardonic.
[00:37:05.993 --> 00:37:10.054]  We have to realize that it's not those of us that see the truth that we're that smart.
[00:37:10.434 --> 00:37:14.735]  We're just not totally destroyed mentally, spiritually, psychologically.
[00:37:15.549 --> 00:37:19.612]  There are none so blind as those that have eyes, but do not want to see.
[00:37:20.973 --> 00:37:22.254]  Have ears, but refuse to hear.
[00:37:23.815 --> 00:37:28.439]  So, Drudge, Jerusalem Post, sensationalized story about nuclear Iran, another one here.
[00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:34.143]  Key details on Ramzi Clark, being the defense lawyer for Saddam.
[00:37:34.163 --> 00:37:41.368]  They've already killed like three lawyers and tried to kill an assistant, so... I don't know about Clark, folks.
[00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:43.210]  Sometimes I think he's super deep cover.
[00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:52.489]  I've met him several times, interviewed him several times on radio, on TV, and I just don't know about Mr. Attorney General.
[00:37:52.929 --> 00:37:57.852]  Saddam yells at Judge in unruly session and says, I don't care if you execute me.
[00:37:58.172 --> 00:37:59.933]  We don't even know that's Saddam, folks.
[00:37:59.953 --> 00:38:01.454]  Do you understand that?
[00:38:02.395 --> 00:38:02.815]  I know you do.
[00:38:02.835 --> 00:38:04.136]  You're smarter than I am, most of you.
[00:38:05.397 --> 00:38:06.457]  And I've got news like this.
[00:38:06.477 --> 00:38:12.100]  Netanyahu hints that they could consider Iran a nuclear strike.
[00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:12.821]  Go ahead and hit it.
[00:38:14.122 --> 00:38:16.744]  Insurgents ambush and kill 19 Iraqi soldiers.
[00:38:16.824 --> 00:38:19.285]  Roadside bomb and gunfire wound several.
[00:38:19.725 --> 00:38:22.387]  I want to read this article Paul and I wrote last Friday.
[00:38:22.407 --> 00:38:23.207]  I never got to.
[00:38:23.848 --> 00:38:24.708]  Empire and dissent.
[00:38:24.748 --> 00:38:26.549]  The deliberate destruction of America.
[00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:31.092]  Worldwide hatred of the United States.
[00:38:31.112 --> 00:38:34.274]  An intentional precursor for world government takeover.
[00:38:35.766 --> 00:38:36.006]  F.B.I.
[00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:38.509]  is taking another look at Ford's pre-war intelligence.
[00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:42.833]  Oh, they're looking to see why the White House went on false documents.
[00:38:43.293 --> 00:38:45.255]  The White House admittedly produced them.
[00:38:46.856 --> 00:38:47.357]  C.I.A.
[00:38:47.437 --> 00:38:52.721]  bosses, we know more on Bin Laden and others, we just can't tell you, Porter Goss says.
[00:38:53.342 --> 00:38:57.005]  And, you know, I see articles like this all the time and it's just so horrible I don't even cover it.
[00:38:57.886 --> 00:38:59.908]  Sex lessons planned for all children.
[00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:01.950]  Five-year-olds to get lessons.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.241]  And it goes in, in the London Observer, into the lessons.
[00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:08.641]  And folks, we can't even read the lessons on air.
[00:39:08.661 --> 00:39:12.402]  This is England, this is what they're trying in the US, robbing people of innocence.
[00:39:13.283 --> 00:39:18.344]  Every time they have suicide, anti-suicide classes, suicides increase, documented.
[00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:20.224]  It introduces it into their heads.
[00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:21.625]  They never thought about it.
[00:39:22.305 --> 00:39:24.266]  It makes it popular, a way to get attention.
[00:39:24.646 --> 00:39:26.006]  Oh, they put the kids on drugs.
[00:39:27.182 --> 00:39:28.903]  You see, the big farmer makes money off this.
[00:39:29.323 --> 00:39:34.845]  It causes, the drugs cause more suicides, and talking about it introduces it, popularizes it, and causes suicides.
[00:39:35.305 --> 00:39:37.506]  And it's the same thing with all this sex education.
[00:39:38.006 --> 00:39:41.847]  But, you know, they could argue it for 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.
[00:39:43.448 --> 00:39:44.308]  Argue some.
[00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.249]  You know, explain the diseases you can get and stuff.
[00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:48.410]  That was the old-fashioned type that actually helped.
[00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:54.112]  No, this new one that they're doing is five years old, and we're going to tell you everything.
[00:39:57.506 --> 00:39:58.106]  Unbelievable.
[00:39:58.426 --> 00:40:00.407]  Allawi claims assassination attempt.
[00:40:00.527 --> 00:40:03.389]  Well, that's Satan calling Beelzebub bad.
[00:40:04.249 --> 00:40:07.250]  Report finds cover-up in FBI terror case.
[00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:07.851]  Oh, really?
[00:40:07.891 --> 00:40:08.591]  The New York Times.
[00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:11.112]  Oh, covering up 9-11 information.
[00:40:11.212 --> 00:40:11.652]  Really?
[00:40:12.092 --> 00:40:14.894]  Private security guards in Iraq operate with little supervision.
[00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:15.574]  LA Times.
[00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:21.694]  I covered this last Friday and got the emails that I was a liar.
[00:40:21.814 --> 00:40:23.715]  No one ever survives abortions.
[00:40:23.735 --> 00:40:25.677]  It didn't matter if it was Times of London.
[00:40:25.697 --> 00:40:29.600]  It didn't matter if I interviewed people who were 30 years old who survived abortions.
[00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:34.263]  Jenna Jensen was aborted at seven and a half months.
[00:40:34.484 --> 00:40:36.185]  She survived, astonishingly.
[00:40:36.585 --> 00:40:39.688]  She has forgiven her mother for trying to kill her.
[00:40:39.728 --> 00:40:40.328]  London Telegraph.
[00:40:40.548 --> 00:40:41.589]  We're going to get her on.
[00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.531]  This isn't the other people I've ever heard of.
[00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:45.212]  This is somebody new.
[00:40:46.474 --> 00:40:47.794]  So we'll get into that.
[00:40:50.055 --> 00:40:52.795]  Congress considers stripping homeowners of state protections.
[00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:55.055]  Oh yeah, you thought they were going to protect you from land grabs?
[00:40:55.256 --> 00:40:55.396]  Uh-uh.
[00:40:56.596 --> 00:40:58.456]  Deadly bacteria spreading through U.S.
[00:40:58.516 --> 00:40:58.956]  hospitals.
[00:40:58.996 --> 00:40:59.876]  That's a real threat.
[00:41:01.317 --> 00:41:03.817]  Fossil fuel theory takes hit with NASA finding.
[00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:06.417]  Tamiflu.
[00:41:07.718 --> 00:41:09.258]  Useless against avian flu.
[00:41:11.478 --> 00:41:12.078]  And a lot more.
[00:41:12.138 --> 00:41:13.319]  It's all coming up.
[00:41:13.399 --> 00:41:15.699]  Okay, but I'm going to right now go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:17.502]  I want to talk to everybody.
[00:41:17.522 --> 00:41:18.163]  Let's move quickly.
[00:41:18.624 --> 00:41:21.007]  Ken in Maine, way up north there.
[00:41:21.027 --> 00:41:21.607]  How you doing, Ken?
[00:41:21.968 --> 00:41:23.570]  Well, fine if you want to ask for details.
[00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:27.495]  I feel kind of sorry about all that widespread stuff.
[00:41:27.515 --> 00:41:33.302]  I'd like to give you a little focal view on that Supreme Court decision involving Connecticut.
[00:41:35.646 --> 00:41:37.667]  Tell us specifically about which one you're discussing.
[00:41:37.807 --> 00:41:41.049]  Well, the one that allows the government to take land.
[00:41:41.529 --> 00:41:50.613]  Yeah, the New London... If a private robber baron wants your land, that goes back to Prima Nocte, or wants your wife, it is his, by right of kings.
[00:41:50.873 --> 00:41:52.954]  Okay, well let me give you a little local feedback.
[00:41:53.615 --> 00:41:57.356]  We have these land trusts up here, who own a lot of land tax exempt.
[00:41:58.477 --> 00:42:02.559]  And last week, a friend of mine, who used to be a first blood man in a small town,
[00:42:03.217 --> 00:42:08.199]  I went and told the Board of Assessors that they should go and talk to these folks, and guess what?
[00:42:08.719 --> 00:42:09.880]  They stepped up voluntarily.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.742]  They're going to start paying taxes, rather than face eminent domain proceedings.
[00:42:14.602 --> 00:42:17.363]  I think this is a movement that can spread on a very local level.
[00:42:17.804 --> 00:42:19.624]  What, people are saying they're no longer going to pay taxes?
[00:42:19.965 --> 00:42:20.725]  No, no, no, no.
[00:42:21.145 --> 00:42:26.347]  This is a land trust group that owns land, you know, forever and beyond, that don't pay taxes on it.
[00:42:27.448 --> 00:42:29.869]  They are now going to start paying taxes voluntarily.
[00:42:32.442 --> 00:42:33.162]  Why is that?
[00:42:33.563 --> 00:42:40.509]  Because they don't want to risk eminent domain proceedings and take their land away from them and give it to somebody who will pay taxes on it.
[00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.011]  Oh, I understand.
[00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:45.453]  It's a non-profit organization.
[00:42:46.093 --> 00:42:49.236]  Is it the Nature Conservancy?
[00:42:49.977 --> 00:42:51.118]  Nope, it's a local one.
[00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:55.261]  I don't want to give you on the air because it's too local and we're just starting.
[00:42:55.682 --> 00:42:57.263]  We're going to spread this throughout the state.
[00:42:57.884 --> 00:42:58.925]  And we're going to go from there.
[00:42:59.465 --> 00:43:00.926]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[00:43:01.146 --> 00:43:02.608]  I don't fully understand.
[00:43:02.628 --> 00:43:05.049]  I mean, I see where you're going with that.
[00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:26.285]  Oh, the government says that if somebody else can pay more taxes than you and put your land to better use, your house, your bowling alley, your grocery store, your auto repair shop, then somebody else who wants to put, say, a hotel there, then we're going to take your property.
[00:43:27.393 --> 00:43:31.535]  And so you go, okay, well then I'll just pay taxes on it.
[00:43:32.335 --> 00:43:36.577]  They're already taking land from people that have been paying taxes.
[00:43:36.737 --> 00:43:51.344]  And I guess that if a local group that Nature Conservancy or somebody else that's holding property thinks they need to do that, I see that as a caving in or a capitulation to this.
[00:43:53.852 --> 00:43:55.613]  I mean, look, we already don't own our land.
[00:43:55.653 --> 00:43:58.274]  We pay a yearly rent on it in property taxes.
[00:44:00.435 --> 00:44:06.157]  And if we don't pay that property tax, that yearly rent, it's just like renting a house from somebody.
[00:44:06.177 --> 00:44:07.738]  You don't pay the rent, you'll be evicted.
[00:44:09.659 --> 00:44:13.981]  Hundreds of homes every year here in Austin are taken because people fall on bad luck.
[00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:15.181]  Usually they're elderly people.
[00:44:15.542 --> 00:44:18.663]  They can't pay it anymore and they take the house and put them in a nursing home.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.000]  Usually the kids won't defend the old folks.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.981]  They're too busy out partying and playboying.
[00:44:24.641 --> 00:44:27.161]  So the old folks don't know how to defend themselves.
[00:44:27.221 --> 00:44:28.262]  I mean, I've seen this happen.
[00:44:29.122 --> 00:44:38.323]  And so in the proceedings, even if the old folks are ready just to give it up, the city will do some proceedings and then charge them lawyer bills for the proceedings and then take the house.
[00:44:38.343 --> 00:44:39.884]  And the old folks don't even get anything for it.
[00:44:39.924 --> 00:44:46.845]  And they go into a nursing home where they are prepared for death.
[00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:52.454]  Where they don't have their beds changed, their bedclothes changed, their family doesn't visit them, and they just die.
[00:44:52.474 --> 00:44:56.937]  I'm not trying to be negative here, I'm just mentioning what really goes on.
[00:44:56.957 --> 00:45:01.079]  You know, since you mentioned it, sir, let me just read part of it.
[00:45:01.679 --> 00:45:05.542]  Congress considers stripping homeowners of state protections.
[00:45:06.977 --> 00:45:17.992]  The Center for Responsible Lending, CRL, is reporting that a new bill in Congress would override and weaken state anti-predatory lending laws that protect homeowners.
[00:45:19.073 --> 00:45:22.197]  Congressman Nye, Republican Ohio, and
[00:45:23.425 --> 00:45:29.189]  Ken Jaworski of Pennsylvania have introduced legislation that would roll back state protections for homeowners.
[00:45:29.649 --> 00:45:34.613]  Prompting uniformity among the states is a good reason to introduce federal legislation.
[00:45:34.653 --> 00:45:37.955]  Such legislation can ensure that states don't race to the bottom.
[00:45:39.156 --> 00:45:42.619]  So this is changing the economic rules across the board.
[00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:46.161]  And I hadn't heard of what the caller mentioned, Ken in Maine.
[00:45:46.401 --> 00:45:47.202]  I'm glad he called.
[00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:49.884]  I'm not criticizing or poo-pooing what he said.
[00:45:49.904 --> 00:45:52.966]  It just signifies a capitulation.
[00:45:53.675 --> 00:45:56.776]  What I think it shows is how desperate people are.
[00:45:57.797 --> 00:46:00.338]  And that folks know this is serious.
[00:46:01.339 --> 00:46:02.579]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.720]  This is feudalism.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.922]  This is, you're not using the land.
[00:46:09.542 --> 00:46:12.624]  I'm here to tell the Johnson family, I'm the Duke of Edinburgh.
[00:46:13.484 --> 00:46:32.801]  And I'm here to tell the Johnson family that my land manager has informed me that your quota has dropped off in the last two years of grain production, of wheat production, and so I'm going to take your feudal holding and I'm going to put you out.
[00:46:33.502 --> 00:46:50.110]  This happened routinely, and I'm going to give your holding that you were allowed to stay on, to squat on, your little hovel, your little leaking shack, to the Goldsmith family, or to the Smith family, or to the Jones family.
[00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:55.372]  And then I have my sheriff come and throw you out.
[00:46:56.788 --> 00:47:04.312]  Or I have my warden come and throw you out, or the constable come and throw you out, and then you go and you starve to death.
[00:47:04.472 --> 00:47:07.874]  Literally starve to death on the streets.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:11.820]  Freedom!
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.360]  Freedom!
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:20.022]  Because this individual will produce more and pay me a larger ten percent.
[00:47:20.082 --> 00:47:27.324]  Feudal serves it to pay, on average, in some areas of France it was higher, but on average around Europe, from what I've read, it was around ten percent.
[00:47:28.584 --> 00:47:29.464]  Well, what do we pay?
[00:47:29.944 --> 00:47:30.604]  Boys and girls.
[00:47:30.624 --> 00:47:32.005]  Can you see?
[00:47:33.245 --> 00:47:37.826]  And so this is really just, look, they're going back to feudalism.
[00:47:38.482 --> 00:47:41.429]  They confuse you with liberal, conservative, and all this other garbage.
[00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.014]  And what I try to tell the leftists every day is this.
[00:47:47.555 --> 00:47:50.076]  The corporations are becoming the government.
[00:47:50.116 --> 00:47:52.138]  The corporations control the government.
[00:47:52.178 --> 00:47:55.840]  The corporations order the government to come after their competition.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.923]  You fools think that big government's going to save you and help you and stop the big evil corporations.
[00:48:02.503 --> 00:48:05.885]  And then conservatives just say, give corporations free reign, let them do whatever they want.
[00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:15.090]  So with those two views together, we end up with this monopoly, crony capitalism, which is more centralized than communism.
[00:48:16.957 --> 00:48:18.899]  There's four forms of capitalism, folks.
[00:48:18.919 --> 00:48:20.881]  People just think, oh, capitalism, it's good.
[00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:22.802]  Well, what form of capitalism is it?
[00:48:23.803 --> 00:48:30.409]  Capitalism itself is nothing but a name for mercantilism and then the subgroups of mercantilism.
[00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.491]  You know what mercantilism is?
[00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:34.372]  You better find out.
[00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:37.195]  Believe me, the Federal Reserve Chairman knows what it is.
[00:48:37.395 --> 00:48:38.156]  He lives by it.
[00:48:41.558 --> 00:48:41.979]  Jacob.
[00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.151]  In Toronto, Canada.
[00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:44.751]  Go ahead.
[00:48:45.231 --> 00:48:45.452]  Alex?
[00:48:45.912 --> 00:48:46.332]  Yes?
[00:48:46.952 --> 00:48:47.873]  It's great to talk to you.
[00:48:48.733 --> 00:48:52.456]  God bless you for spreading the good word and clearing up people's misconceptions.
[00:48:53.076 --> 00:48:56.158]  I did want to clear up a misconception that I think maybe you have.
[00:48:56.518 --> 00:48:59.760]  And it's in regards to witches and witchcraft.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:06.984]  And what I wanted to let you know is that just like anything else in life, there's black and there's white and there's a little bit of grey in between.
[00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:09.766]  But there's a lot of good witches out there, a lot of
[00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:16.834]  People who are in a spiritual realm to fight all this evil from a different perspective.
[00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:21.156]  Kind of like Glenda the Good Witch and the Wizard of Oz?
[00:49:21.316 --> 00:49:22.116]  Are you helping them?
[00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:26.438]  If you make just then that's your choice.
[00:49:27.199 --> 00:49:30.622]  But you preach freedom of religion on your network.
[00:49:30.642 --> 00:49:32.563]  Sir, I believe you have freedom.
[00:49:32.583 --> 00:49:34.405]  I agree.
[00:49:34.425 --> 00:49:35.686]  Sir, what I'm trying to tell you is this.
[00:49:35.726 --> 00:49:36.007]  Listen.
[00:49:36.507 --> 00:49:42.733]  I'm not saying there aren't well-meaning people and people that help little old ladies across the street who are into all that stuff.
[00:49:42.753 --> 00:49:43.653]  That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:44.915]  I'm just telling you this, sir.
[00:49:45.635 --> 00:49:46.536]  I'll hold you over in the meantime.
[00:49:46.556 --> 00:49:47.357]  I'm not going to cut you short.
[00:49:48.067 --> 00:49:51.651]  I'm just telling you that you can say whatever you want.
[00:49:51.752 --> 00:49:59.561]  The roots of all of these druidic and animistic religions all lead back to human sacrifice and horned god worship.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.821]  Now, go ahead and say your piece.
[00:50:02.221 --> 00:50:03.721]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:05.182]  No, that's fair if you believe that.
[00:50:05.242 --> 00:50:08.843]  I mean, I have my own... We'll leave that for another day.
[00:50:09.143 --> 00:50:13.785]  I wanted to ask you about the possibility of George Bush being assassinated on 9-11.
[00:50:14.005 --> 00:50:15.706]  This is something I heard about last week.
[00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:27.110]  And just the fact that somebody either talked him down or he begged them not to kill him because by the planes flying into the buildings, however that happened,
[00:50:27.478 --> 00:50:31.521]  Plus him being assassinated would, just martial law would happen right there and then.
[00:50:31.822 --> 00:50:33.323]  What, have you heard anything about this?
[00:50:33.383 --> 00:50:35.985]  About the possibility of him being sniped on that day as well?
[00:50:36.285 --> 00:50:45.552]  I've heard all of this and it's just come from sources that, just because somebody says something doesn't mean it's, stay there.
[00:50:46.373 --> 00:50:48.855]  Stay there and I'll let you get to your point.
[00:50:48.895 --> 00:50:49.856]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:51.717 --> 00:50:53.739]  We'll talk on the other side of this quick break.
[00:50:54.654 --> 00:51:00.998]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.719 --> 00:51:05.561]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.821 --> 00:51:07.402]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.762 --> 00:51:12.425]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.766 --> 00:51:19.490]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.811]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.011 --> 00:51:24.833]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.933 --> 00:51:29.595]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.815 --> 00:51:34.217]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[00:54:08.606 --> 00:54:11.469]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:18.876 --> 00:54:22.179]  Alright, Jacob, Jason, Jeanette, Terry, Keith.
[00:54:22.199 --> 00:54:23.020]  We're gonna get to everybody.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.504]  I don't want to say I'm getting off to a slow start, just for the calls I always do.
[00:54:27.524 --> 00:54:30.227]  There's so much news, so much I want to talk about.
[00:54:31.275 --> 00:54:36.777]  But look, 9-11, we know a lot of things have happened that we can't prove or we're not exactly sure about.
[00:54:36.837 --> 00:54:52.984]  What we know is this, the official story is a complete fraud, up one side and down the other, from end to end, its entire circumference, every molecule of it, is impossible and a fraud and a lie, and we know the Globalist funded the attacks, ran the attacks, we have all the evidence of that.
[00:54:54.384 --> 00:54:55.405]  You know, exactly
[00:54:57.492 --> 00:55:05.815]  How it was funded, the precise operation of it, you know, did he gag her first or tie her ankles first, you know, in a murder investigation?
[00:55:05.855 --> 00:55:06.675]  We don't know that.
[00:55:06.955 --> 00:55:11.397]  The killers won't tell us, but we've caught him red-handed with thousands of pieces of evidence.
[00:55:11.417 --> 00:55:16.618]  I mean, it's an orgy of evidence, as police detectives would call something with just a ridiculous amount of evidence.
[00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:23.800]  You know, the equivalent of the killer videotaping himself doing it and writing journals about it and telling 15 people.
[00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:25.261]  I mean, it's just
[00:55:26.135 --> 00:55:29.901]  We know that Bush flew out to this Air Force Base up in Nebraska.
[00:55:30.381 --> 00:55:36.210]  We know that some of the top CEOs, was it like a hundred of them plus, met in some command bunker.
[00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:41.278]  We know that all the top CEOs that were in the towers were at that meeting.
[00:55:41.998 --> 00:55:45.080]  I mean, yes, something really, some deal got made.
[00:55:45.461 --> 00:55:46.081]  We know that.
[00:55:46.161 --> 00:55:47.702]  Something really weird went on.
[00:55:47.742 --> 00:55:55.047]  We know Marvin Bush ran security and his security deal ended on 9-10 so he wouldn't have any liability.
[00:55:55.368 --> 00:56:00.011]  And he was there that morning closing up some accounts and then left and was on the train when it all hit.
[00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:01.892]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:56:03.073 --> 00:56:08.417]  But I don't know, I don't know if, I mean obviously these people are above Bush.
[00:56:09.813 --> 00:56:15.016]  Bush is a puppet, but I mean, I hear all this stuff, and I just don't know what's true and what's not.
[00:56:15.036 --> 00:56:16.616]  I can only stick to what I can prove.
[00:56:16.636 --> 00:56:17.877]  Does that answer your question, Jacob?
[00:56:18.177 --> 00:56:20.358]  No, absolutely, and I appreciate your time.
[00:56:20.618 --> 00:56:23.740]  One last thing I want to quickly say is about the activist that you spoke about.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:34.665]  That person was Canadian, and the person is a good person, and they're being held captive by the man, and I hope they're okay, and thank you very much for your time, sir.
[00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:35.726]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:56:35.746 --> 00:56:37.987]  I appreciate your call, and I hope that you'll
[00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:48.413]  I hope you'll investigate the roots of the pagan, druidic rites that we call modern witchcraft today.
[00:56:48.433 --> 00:56:55.337]  And I hope you'll find out that it just, in every case, leads back to human sacrifice, leads back to oppression, leads back to evil.
[00:56:56.197 --> 00:56:58.398]  And I know you can point at Christianity and say that, too.
[00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:02.681]  But that's people using it for bad.
[00:57:02.721 --> 00:57:05.022]  That's people using it as an excuse.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:14.842]  The pagan and druidic rites, or the Aztec, or Toltec, or Romantic rites, all of those lead back to their very foundations.
[00:57:15.262 --> 00:57:22.184]  That is in the dogma, that is in the camp, that is in the scriptural foundational text.
[00:57:22.864 --> 00:57:24.684]  It's foundational, it's doctrinal.
[00:57:25.605 --> 00:57:29.226]  Human sacrifice is not doctrinal, except for the sacrifice of Christ.
[00:57:29.426 --> 00:57:31.006]  All these things are counterfeits, folks.
[00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:37.797]  And then pagans would argue, no, we predate Christianity, we're the old time religion, and sacrifice.
[00:57:38.797 --> 00:57:42.158]  Well, I'll just tell you this, the Christians stopped the sacrificing.
[00:57:42.658 --> 00:57:51.001]  The Jews stopped sacrificing people a thousand years before Christ even showed up on the scene.
[00:57:52.273 --> 00:57:56.597]  And now, I've really opened a can of worms, and now we're going to be off to the races.
[00:57:57.097 --> 00:57:57.838]  And c'est la vie!
[00:57:57.898 --> 00:58:01.261]  It's open phones, it's free speech, whatever you want to talk about.
[00:58:01.461 --> 00:58:02.682]  I just know God.
[00:58:02.702 --> 00:58:04.904]  And I have my beliefs, and I know I'm right.
[00:58:05.545 --> 00:58:11.210]  I've experienced it on a millisecond by the millisecond time frame.
[00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:13.892]  I have known a lot of people that are into the occult growing up.
[00:58:14.312 --> 00:58:14.993]  I still do.
[00:58:15.633 --> 00:58:17.195]  And the fruits are not pretty.
[00:58:20.305 --> 00:58:22.206]  The fruits are not pretty.
[00:58:22.246 --> 00:58:24.187]  It's very dangerous.
[00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:35.234]  And I think most people who are good at heart, and who are just dabbling like Solomon, I think you're going to come out of it.
[00:58:35.914 --> 00:58:38.216]  Alright, we're going to be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:44.420]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.

[00:58:56.613 --> 00:58:57.254]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.914 --> 00:58:58.974]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.675 --> 00:59:00.795]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.435 --> 00:59:02.255]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.016 --> 00:59:04.036]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.596 --> 00:59:08.518]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.758 --> 00:59:12.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.800]  Okay, hour number two.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.021]  I covered a lot of news on the periphery.
[00:59:19.842 --> 00:59:20.422]  The peripheral.
[00:59:22.917 --> 00:59:24.638]  And we took a few calls.
[00:59:24.758 --> 00:59:26.478]  I really want to just blast through your calls.
[00:59:26.518 --> 00:59:27.758]  I got a bunch of audio clips.
[00:59:27.798 --> 00:59:28.279]  Well, not a bunch.
[00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:29.819]  I got two I want to play, actually three.
[00:59:30.639 --> 00:59:31.979]  I got just so much news.
[00:59:31.999 --> 00:59:37.201]  This is so much here on the bird flu, on superb bacteria spreading around the U.S.
[00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:41.462]  that are a million times more dangerous than this vicious chicken flu.
[00:59:42.422 --> 00:59:46.063]  And the torture news, fake nuke news.
[00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.904]  It's a plethora, but I want to take your calls.
[00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:52.478]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland and Jeanette, Terry, and others.
[00:59:52.498 --> 00:59:53.219]  Go ahead, Jason.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:54.880]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:58.944]  You're going to address one of the things I was calling you about.
[00:59:59.004 --> 01:00:17.639]  I haven't been able to listen to you for about a month now and I wanted to hear you talk about the bird flu and also if you could speak a little bit about President Bush addressing the nation on the television the other day about renewing the Patriot Act or parts of it or whatever he was saying.
[01:00:18.884 --> 01:00:20.645]  I'd like to hear your comments on that.
[01:00:21.965 --> 01:00:22.605]  You want to do that?
[01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:28.907]  Well, I mean, basically, the bird flu, it's been proven as a total fraud.
[01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:29.967]  Well, I know that.
[01:00:30.108 --> 01:00:36.469]  I mean, really, what the government is, their plans are, as far as what he was saying before, is shutting down cities.
[01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:44.752]  And, you know, if we were, they're going to contain, you know, containment and all that stuff they were talking about.
[01:00:45.689 --> 01:00:50.773]  I know it's a farce, but I'm talking about what they're planning to do with the farce.
[01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.877]  Well, we don't know their exact battle plans.
[01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.538]  We know what their programs are.
[01:00:56.558 --> 01:00:58.600]  They have multiple programs running at the same time.
[01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:04.178]  We don't know when they're going to activate, when they're going to launch their attack patterns.
[01:01:04.778 --> 01:01:09.341]  We don't know when they're going to engage their operations against us.
[01:01:09.981 --> 01:01:10.842]  They're ongoing.
[01:01:11.762 --> 01:01:16.265]  We knew six, seven years ago they were going to use bio-attacks as a pretext for total martial law.
[01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:21.668]  Now they're getting us into the stage of preparing us, conditioning us.
[01:01:22.228 --> 01:01:27.431]  Federalizing local areas, and then we resist it, we educate, we fight it, we expose it.
[01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:29.812]  They do beta tests and litmus tests.
[01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:33.635]  They find out that we're not going along with it, so they back off.
[01:01:34.095 --> 01:01:37.297]  Then people say, hey, where's the coming bio attack you talked about?
[01:01:37.337 --> 01:01:40.799]  We go, wait a minute, it's the government saying it's going to happen.
[01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:42.860]  There's going to be a smallpox attack.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.421]  There's going to be bird flu.
[01:01:44.821 --> 01:01:48.663]  When you follow that line of thought though, I think it might be a little dangerous to assume that
[01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.164]  Uh, the threats are hollow.
[01:02:11.724 --> 01:02:13.786]  You know that as well, better than anybody.
[01:02:13.846 --> 01:02:15.108]  Oh, they'll spring an attack.
[01:02:15.168 --> 01:02:17.070]  It could be suitcase snitch, bioweapons.
[01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:18.911]  It could most likely be chemicals.
[01:02:18.931 --> 01:02:20.213]  They'll claim it's biological.
[01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:24.377]  Or it'll be a biological, but they'll tell us it's something completely different.
[01:02:25.334 --> 01:02:27.095]  And then it'll come out, you know, five years later.
[01:02:27.115 --> 01:02:36.777]  Look, this is all done just to get us into compact cities, to get us under control, to get us to accept police walking around the street corners demanding to see our IDs randomly.
[01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:39.438]  And that's already happening in Miami and other areas.
[01:02:39.838 --> 01:02:46.360]  So their martial law, Red Dawn, East German society is rising without them even launching the attack.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.300]  They're just doing it.
[01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:51.462]  Well, and I'm going to let you address the other callers.
[01:02:53.154 --> 01:02:59.719]  I have one question left, and still I'd like you to speak to the renewal of the Patriot Act.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:14.231]  With the Panama Canal being given away by Clinton, and now the main thoroughfare to the center of our country being under basically federal control... Spanish!
[01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:15.512]  Sure.
[01:03:16.072 --> 01:03:19.274]  And by Spanish, folks, I don't mean Latin America, I mean Spain.
[01:03:20.736 --> 01:03:22.117]  Well, then you have to elaborate.
[01:03:23.746 --> 01:03:28.390]  Well, most of the arterials and the main road are going to be administered by a Spanish company.
[01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.174]  Can you speak towards their end, the means to the end?
[01:03:33.734 --> 01:03:35.296]  Sure, let me get a break and I'll come back.
[01:03:35.336 --> 01:03:35.956]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:36.677 --> 01:03:47.226]  I'll try to briefly comment on the Patriot Act and all of its manifestations and incarnations, and then about the NAFTA highway system.
[01:03:47.926 --> 01:03:49.948]  It's not just the middle of the country, it's all over the nation.
[01:03:52.327 --> 01:03:53.829]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:57.112]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:57.252 --> 01:04:01.155]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:05.419]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:09.543]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:09.684 --> 01:04:11.525]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:11.545 --> 01:04:15.029]  A riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:16.130]  The medical bills!
[01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:19.752]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:19.892 --> 01:04:22.934]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.114 --> 01:04:26.016]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:26.477 --> 01:04:32.581]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:36.906]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:51.662 --> 01:04:55.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:55.423 --> 01:04:58.924]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:59.004 --> 01:05:02.945]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:09.327]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:09.728 --> 01:05:17.650]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:23.412]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:23.572 --> 01:05:27.333]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.693 --> 01:05:29.533]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:31.794]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:32.014 --> 01:05:36.615]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:05:36.655 --> 01:05:42.737]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:45.938 --> 01:05:48.379]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:49.780]  Protect your family.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.301]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:53.562 --> 01:05:57.403]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:57.723 --> 01:05:58.524]  Read the labels.
[01:05:58.964 --> 01:06:03.106]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:03.306 --> 01:06:07.508]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:07.868 --> 01:06:12.750]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.512]  Now just buy one of these CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:15.712 --> 01:06:21.056]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:21.316 --> 01:06:24.059]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:25.259]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:38.111 --> 01:06:39.113]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit Cal-BenPureSoap.com.
[01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:04.093]  Yeah.
[01:07:22.478 --> 01:07:22.998]  Waging War!
[01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:52.210]  On corruption.
[01:07:55.211 --> 01:08:02.975]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central back from 9 to midnight.
[01:08:03.675 --> 01:08:05.036]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:05.896 --> 01:08:13.440]  Trying to cover the compendium of the encyclopedic universe that is around us.
[01:08:14.855 --> 01:08:25.102]  Trying to cover all of the criminal activities being engaged in by a criminal class using systematic high-tech propaganda against our populations.
[01:08:25.662 --> 01:08:33.067]  It is daunting because the evidence is so overwhelming and it's like a beach covered with diamonds.
[01:08:33.147 --> 01:08:37.310]  It's just one diamond would prove our case and I'm wallowing in them.
[01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:41.853]  Wallowing in 100 carat perfectly formed flawless stones.
[01:08:42.961 --> 01:08:45.742]  Their own stated plans to exterminate 95% of us.
[01:08:45.782 --> 01:08:50.825]  Their own stated plans to put us in compact cities and dumb us down and totally control us.
[01:08:50.845 --> 01:08:54.246]  Their own stated plans to take our private property and break up our families.
[01:08:54.266 --> 01:08:57.087]  Their own stated plans to set up a one world government.
[01:08:57.648 --> 01:08:59.368]  But the general public doesn't read.
[01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:00.909]  The general public isn't informed.
[01:09:01.129 --> 01:09:09.513]  The general public that is somewhat informed buys into the next layer of the onion the strata of fake news and false political paradigms.
[01:09:10.822 --> 01:09:17.204]  Then if you break through that, you break the realm of artificial radicals and COINTELPRO disinfo artists.
[01:09:17.224 --> 01:09:31.349]  Then you break through that, then you get into the next strata and start then debating alternative political paradigms and terms, when all it is is neo-feudalism and a neo-fascist mercantile global plantation.
[01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:32.989]  That's it!
[01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:33.689]  That's all it is!
[01:09:33.809 --> 01:09:34.149]  Simple!
[01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:38.811]  We're not that complex of a species when you really look at it all and you boil it all down.
[01:09:42.423 --> 01:09:47.525]  Alright, let's just go to your calls, because I've got all these audio clips coming up, and there's tons of news here, and I want to also hear from you.
[01:09:47.805 --> 01:09:50.066]  Jeanette and Tejas, thank you for holding patiently.
[01:09:50.086 --> 01:09:50.707]  You're on the air.
[01:09:50.727 --> 01:09:52.187]  Hi Alex, thanks.
[01:09:52.988 --> 01:10:05.994]  My son just turned 18 recently, and so now we're faced with registration with the Selective Service, and in order to avoid the danger of an eventual draft, he's wondering whether or not to register.
[01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:08.355]  He knows the penalties concerned with that.
[01:10:08.555 --> 01:10:09.095]  I never did it!
[01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:10.342]  Well, I know that.
[01:10:10.362 --> 01:10:11.363]  I remember you saying that.
[01:10:12.323 --> 01:10:18.426]  He also knows that he can go with a conscientious objection, which may not protect him at all.
[01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:23.168]  There have been just a handful of prosecutions of that.
[01:10:25.049 --> 01:10:28.311]  It's got holes in it you can fly a Death Star through.
[01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:37.155]  They can't enforce it, and if your son's intending to refuse a draft, then I would refuse that selective service because, see, that's a contract.
[01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:37.783]  Right.
[01:10:38.384 --> 01:10:39.944]  And so it's already the first step.
[01:10:40.425 --> 01:10:42.966]  So it won't make him a real target, though?
[01:10:43.026 --> 01:10:48.149]  And, you know, it talks about prison, it talks about $250,000 fine.
[01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:51.111]  Well, I mean, look, I'm here on air saying I didn't do it.
[01:10:51.371 --> 01:10:52.232]  Right, right.
[01:10:52.452 --> 01:10:55.254]  And I'm here on air saying I pay income taxes.
[01:10:55.714 --> 01:10:55.954]  Sure.
[01:10:56.194 --> 01:11:02.338]  A lot of people get up on air and shoot their mouths up about how they don't pay income taxes, and either they're stupid or they're feds.
[01:11:03.639 --> 01:11:11.785]  Or they're small-time folks that really are seeing that it's a fraud and doing it at their own risk.
[01:11:11.885 --> 01:11:13.426]  And now I've opened another can of worms.
[01:11:14.247 --> 01:11:18.210]  But I'm telling you, on this Selective Service thing, it is a total fraud.
[01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:19.311]  Are you free?
[01:11:19.431 --> 01:11:20.132]  Are you a slave?
[01:11:21.032 --> 01:11:21.333]  Right.
[01:11:21.693 --> 01:11:21.933]  Right.
[01:11:23.194 --> 01:11:25.256]  Well, okay, he has another question, too.
[01:11:26.156 --> 01:11:30.520]  What if he were to voluntarily join, like, the Coast Guard and go into a
[01:11:31.158 --> 01:11:31.678]  I think so.
[01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:52.669]  That's a whole other ball of wax, but they know what they're doing.
[01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.370]  Folks, we're not just saying this.
[01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:57.372]  It's not like smoking a few packs of cigarettes is bad for you.
[01:11:57.412 --> 01:11:59.714]  We mean it's really bad for you.
[01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:10.502]  Right, and he's never been vaccinated all his life, so that would be... If I had to join any of the services, it'd be Air Force or Coast Guard.
[01:12:10.782 --> 01:12:12.303]  That's what he was thinking about the Coast Guard.
[01:12:13.004 --> 01:12:17.147]  Okay, so if you join the Coast Guard, do you still have to register for the Selective Service?
[01:12:18.087 --> 01:12:18.447]  Yes.
[01:12:20.588 --> 01:12:21.088]  Okay.
[01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:22.029]  All right.
[01:12:22.069 --> 01:12:23.290]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:23.950]  All right.
[01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:25.451]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:26.331 --> 01:12:33.514]  I don't want to get into command structure, and I'm not that up on it, but the Coast Guard until a few years ago really was its own little entity, but now it's been rolled in.
[01:12:33.874 --> 01:12:35.195]  Hasn't been rolled into the Navy.
[01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:36.416]  Am I wrong about that?
[01:12:36.476 --> 01:12:37.956]  We've got all the military experts listening.
[01:12:38.277 --> 01:12:44.920]  And look, understand, folks, the governor of the state of Texas said, I am commanding
[01:12:47.265 --> 01:13:03.768]  via a lottery, all men of this age to form up for basic training, and you're going to have to serve six months or a year on the Texas border to defend the state from invasion, I believe that is a constitutional order and must be followed.
[01:13:04.688 --> 01:13:06.849]  If the President did that, I would have to.
[01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.529]  But listen, Congress has not declared war.
[01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.190]  They did not give Bush the power to do this.
[01:13:14.033 --> 01:13:17.117]  They just kind of gave them a blank check, quote, you know, if we were threatened.
[01:13:18.358 --> 01:13:19.820]  And then they created false intelligence.
[01:13:21.301 --> 01:13:26.647]  And these forces are under UN, NATO, international treaty obligation to control.
[01:13:26.988 --> 01:13:28.950]  And as long as they're part of that, it's not our military.
[01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:29.851]  Do you understand that?
[01:13:30.232 --> 01:13:31.253]  Look, I have seen
[01:13:32.288 --> 01:13:36.391]  Thomas Barnett, the golden boy of the Naval War College.
[01:13:36.471 --> 01:13:41.495]  I've watched several of his talks, read his disgusting book, the Pentagon's new map.
[01:13:41.595 --> 01:13:42.616]  Please don't buy it, folks.
[01:13:42.636 --> 01:13:46.959]  I haven't even plugged my own videos yet, and we're an hour and fifteen minutes in, and I'm plugging his.
[01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:53.123]  And I've got him on video saying, we work for the world government, we work for Wall Street, we're taking over the planet.
[01:13:54.965 --> 01:13:56.926]  Look, I mean, they don't even cover it up!
[01:13:57.527 --> 01:14:00.469]  I do not work for Lord Rothschild in London.
[01:14:01.849 --> 01:14:02.730]  Jacob Rothschild.
[01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.691]  I do not work for King Fodd.
[01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:06.733]  I do not work for the Saxe-Coburg Gothas.
[01:14:07.093 --> 01:14:10.055]  I do not work for the Queen of the Netherlands or her princeling.
[01:14:10.836 --> 01:14:12.477]  I do not work for any of these people.
[01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:13.438]  Do you understand?
[01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:16.420]  I will not go saddle up and go fight.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.581]  You're like, well you fight who they sue.
[01:14:18.601 --> 01:14:20.183]  This is not our military.
[01:14:21.564 --> 01:14:23.905]  And see, that's where we get confused and don't understand this.
[01:14:24.866 --> 01:14:27.348]  The Pentagon's own strategy is to lose.
[01:14:28.118 --> 01:14:29.178]  That's how they stay there.
[01:14:29.218 --> 01:14:30.159]  That's how they win.
[01:14:30.639 --> 01:14:32.080]  Because their goals aren't our goals.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.980]  Stop being so naive, folks.
[01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:35.741]  It's called P2LG.
[01:14:35.801 --> 01:14:36.521]  It's called PNAC.
[01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:37.081]  It's public.
[01:14:37.442 --> 01:14:39.022]  By the way, I've really, it's incredible.
[01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:41.163]  I've been saying this for a year before the war.
[01:14:42.924 --> 01:14:44.584]  And I'm not tooting my own horn here.
[01:14:47.325 --> 01:14:48.966]  I've been sending out the SOS.
[01:14:49.066 --> 01:14:50.146]  That's all I've been doing.
[01:14:50.447 --> 01:14:51.647]  Because I read their own documents.
[01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:54.828]  It is now in the London Guardian.
[01:14:55.048 --> 01:14:56.549]  It is now in the Moscow Times.
[01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.674]  It is now in a lot of really prestigious publications.
[01:15:02.996 --> 01:15:05.319]  That, I mean, it's like we wrote these articles.
[01:15:05.379 --> 01:15:07.561]  It's like we're being plagiarized, which I think is just wonderful.
[01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:08.142]  Please continue.
[01:15:09.324 --> 01:15:11.006]  People are finally getting it.
[01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:13.448]  That, wait a minute, they make more money if they stay there.
[01:15:13.828 --> 01:15:17.412]  Well, wait a minute, there's this Israeli document from 83, there's this U.S.
[01:15:17.452 --> 01:15:24.378]  document from 2000, there's this other document from 2002 by Rumsfeld with six billion dollars a year funding it to actually widen the war.
[01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.861]  To make our forces be in a quagmire.
[01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:28.162]  That that was the goal.
[01:15:29.583 --> 01:15:33.467]  There was a invasion strategy and stratagem, a whole
[01:15:35.373 --> 01:15:37.055]  War College report out of Israel in 83.
[01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:39.817]  It's now been in Harajat, Jerusalem Post.
[01:15:41.299 --> 01:15:44.122]  It was even first broke in mainstream news in the late 90's.
[01:15:44.642 --> 01:15:44.982]  But it's from 83.
[01:15:47.458 --> 01:15:49.200]  With their top generals saying, the U.S.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.824]  is going to invade, we're going to break it up into these four regions, it's going to be endless civil war, the U.S.
[01:15:53.844 --> 01:15:59.528]  will build permanent bases there, we're actually going to try to get insurgencies going, and we're advising the U.S.
[01:15:59.588 --> 01:15:59.829]  on this.
[01:15:59.909 --> 01:16:06.654]  And then I see the exact same thing happen, and I'm reading it out of the newspaper, and so I say it, and that's far-fetched for you?
[01:16:07.936 --> 01:16:11.799]  Again, new defense cons, there's Lockheed Martin, there's Halliburton, there's Bechtel,
[01:16:13.487 --> 01:16:15.087]  There's Aegis and Blackwater.
[01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:20.249]  Do they make more money if we're there a year?
[01:16:20.269 --> 01:16:23.390]  Or if we're there ten?
[01:16:26.551 --> 01:16:26.851]  Okay?
[01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:28.131]  Case closed.
[01:16:28.391 --> 01:16:29.172]  Discussion over.
[01:16:29.712 --> 01:16:30.212]  Okay?
[01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.513]  That's why they do everything they can to make it go bad.
[01:16:34.493 --> 01:16:36.414]  And we gotta finish the job.
[01:16:36.434 --> 01:16:37.594]  And the troops love the war.
[01:16:37.874 --> 01:16:40.035]  Number one, Rumsfeld's always said, the troops do not love the war.
[01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:40.995]  I talk to them all the time.
[01:16:42.091 --> 01:16:43.412]  I talk to officers all the time.
[01:16:43.452 --> 01:16:44.693]  I talk to grunts all the time.
[01:16:45.073 --> 01:16:46.634]  I mean, I'm in a military town.
[01:16:46.755 --> 01:16:48.336]  I'm in a military region.
[01:16:48.636 --> 01:16:50.377]  I'm surrounded by military bases.
[01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:52.579]  I talk to them in restaurants.
[01:16:52.599 --> 01:16:53.560]  I talk to them at the gym.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840]  I talk to them on the street.
[01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:56.221]  And let me just tell you something.
[01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:59.524]  When you hear that the troops love it and the American people love the war, it's a fraud!
[01:17:02.245 --> 01:17:07.268]  Now, Hillary loves it, and Bill Clinton loves it, and George Bush loves it, and Henry Kissinger loves it, but we don't love it.
[01:17:07.348 --> 01:17:08.168]  We don't like it.
[01:17:08.729 --> 01:17:11.610]  It's not of the Lord, as we keep hearing people say.
[01:17:11.831 --> 01:17:12.291]  It's not.
[01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:18.314]  It's about as much of the Lord, as I hear these preachers say, as Anton LaVey was.
[01:17:21.796 --> 01:17:23.778]  Now, I'm going to break, and we're going to come back and take more calls.
[01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:29.681]  The caller before the last segment started, this segment started, was asking a question about the Patriot Act.
[01:17:31.318 --> 01:17:33.779]  What they do is they continually reintroduce it.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:43.722]  And you keep hearing that Bush wants it reauthorized and strengthened and expanded.
[01:17:45.043 --> 01:17:48.504]  And they keep passing segments of Patriot Act 2 piecemeal.
[01:17:49.644 --> 01:17:51.565]  And parts of Part 1 piecemeal.
[01:17:52.105 --> 01:17:59.928]  And so when you hear that he wants to reauthorize it again, they're just beefing it up again with no habeas corpus, which is the foundation of the Magna Carta 1215.
[01:18:02.085 --> 01:18:04.065]  That is the foundation of the Mosaic Law.
[01:18:05.046 --> 01:18:06.546]  That is the foundation of everything.
[01:18:07.366 --> 01:18:08.026]  Foundation of 1776, 1789.
[01:18:08.986 --> 01:18:17.708]  I mean, they're going at the very... root of America.
[01:18:18.408 --> 01:18:21.729]  At every level, gnawing at it like a thousand ravenous lions.
[01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:25.549]  And so that's all going on.
[01:18:25.609 --> 01:18:28.250]  I mean, just at every level, they are busy engaging.
[01:18:29.057 --> 01:18:32.461]  Savagely, every liberty, every freedom, everything America is.
[01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:36.206]  And then running around talking about how they're the highest form of Americanism.
[01:18:36.827 --> 01:18:37.868]  I mean, it makes me sick!
[01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:44.616]  Let me just tell you, America isn't guys in Darth Vader outfits demanding to see your papers while the borders are wide open.
[01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:46.198]  Okay?
[01:18:46.218 --> 01:18:46.879]  That's not America.

[01:18:55.265 --> 01:19:01.128]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[01:19:01.809 --> 01:19:11.074]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?

[01:19:50.123 --> 01:19:51.744]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:51.864 --> 01:19:55.967]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:56.107 --> 01:19:58.989]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:19:59.069 --> 01:20:05.754]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:05.934]  Yes.
[01:20:05.954 --> 01:20:08.958]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:09.178 --> 01:20:11.561]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:11.681 --> 01:20:21.854]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:31.156]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:20:31.316 --> 01:20:39.078]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:49.648 --> 01:20:50.088]  Gold.
[01:20:50.428 --> 01:20:51.709]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:51.969 --> 01:20:58.052]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:58.252 --> 01:21:02.074]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:02.414 --> 01:21:04.315]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:06.656]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:06.796 --> 01:21:11.959]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat
[01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:12.399]  We're good to go.
[01:21:27.318 --> 01:21:28.879]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:28.919 --> 01:21:31.079]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:56.653 --> 01:22:04.541]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:04.761 --> 01:22:07.403]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:22:49.685 --> 01:23:01.674]  Alright, now I'm really going to hear calls quick because I want to come back and cover some news and play some clips.
[01:23:02.074 --> 01:23:04.436]  Terry in Florida, welcome here on the air.
[01:23:04.456 --> 01:23:07.158]  Hi, Terry?
[01:23:07.518 --> 01:23:08.299]  Yes, this is Terry.
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:15.244]  Oh, I just want to let you know, were you aware of what's going on with our boundary lines, that they're being taken down?
[01:23:16.287 --> 01:23:19.609]  And that Canada and Mexico are going to become part of the United States?
[01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:21.370]  Yes, I was aware of that.
[01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:22.810]  I've talked about that a couple times.
[01:23:23.271 --> 01:23:25.432]  Okay, and there is a bill that they're trying to pass.
[01:23:25.712 --> 01:23:29.274]  Robert Burr, 1873 is the number of the bill.
[01:23:29.854 --> 01:23:31.094]  And this has to do with the bird flu.
[01:23:31.735 --> 01:23:36.237]  And if they do this, this is going to abolish the 7th Amendment of the Constitution, which is treason and sedition.
[01:23:37.277 --> 01:23:43.119]  Well, they engage in a lot of treason and a lot of criminal activities.
[01:23:43.179 --> 01:23:44.699]  Thanks for the call.
[01:23:45.039 --> 01:23:46.640]  Terry, I'm going to let you go.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.601]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Ohio.
[01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:50.541]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:23:50.601 --> 01:23:50.961]  Welcome.
[01:23:51.501 --> 01:23:51.821]  Hello, Alex.
[01:23:52.162 --> 01:23:52.922]  Keep up the good work.
[01:23:53.002 --> 01:23:53.822]  Keep preaching the truth.
[01:23:54.182 --> 01:23:58.003]  Especially some of them positive things, because we have to deal with all these negative realities, too, you know?
[01:23:58.023 --> 01:23:59.324]  They need to be built up.
[01:23:59.684 --> 01:24:03.765]  But our whole issue with our country, you know, basically it all boils down to sin.
[01:24:04.284 --> 01:24:10.309]  And the consequences of it, and I believe the Lord is allowing those consequences, you know, to give us a taste of hell.
[01:24:10.329 --> 01:24:12.071]  Well, we know what the wages of sin are.
[01:24:12.091 --> 01:24:12.651]  It's death.
[01:24:12.931 --> 01:24:17.215]  And the Lord doesn't want anybody to end up in that eternal lake of fire, so he's kind of giving us a taste here.
[01:24:17.495 --> 01:24:23.801]  We kind of go at each other's throats, you know, and you have the demonic powers, and so the Lord wants to see people saved.
[01:24:23.841 --> 01:24:27.804]  You know, we've taken the bait of sin for decades and decades in this country.
[01:24:28.635 --> 01:24:32.598]  You know, and that's why we have these consequences.
[01:24:32.618 --> 01:24:38.202]  You know, nations kind of go through some periods of, you know, religious apostasy.
[01:24:38.242 --> 01:24:40.904]  You know, the Christianity drifts into an imitation.
[01:24:40.944 --> 01:24:44.667]  And then you get the moral consequences, and then political anarchy.
[01:24:44.707 --> 01:24:48.170]  You know, we need to turn back to the true source of truth.
[01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.350]  Who is the truth?
[01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.771]  The Lord.
[01:24:49.791 --> 01:24:53.654]  So, you know, that's the real core issue.
[01:24:57.202 --> 01:25:02.224]  You know, many things are just consequences, and many times the Lord has a part in those consequences.
[01:25:03.024 --> 01:25:06.045]  Just like He used the Babylonians in Habakkuk 1, you know?
[01:25:06.065 --> 01:25:16.809]  And I can't say how that exactly applies, but He said He raised up the Babylonians, that bitter and hasty nation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.
[01:25:16.869 --> 01:25:23.212]  And so He eventually judged the Babylonians for their sin, but we need to go back to the source of truth, His Word.
[01:25:24.438 --> 01:25:29.764]  And we're still fighting with the Babylonians, which are of course the Iraqis, and you've got the Persians, which are Iran.
[01:25:29.784 --> 01:25:36.571]  I just applied it to general, how the leaders... No, I understand, I understand, with the sacking of Jerusalem.
[01:25:36.871 --> 01:25:38.313]  Thanks for the call, good to hear from you.
[01:25:38.573 --> 01:25:41.736]  Let's talk to Chris, and Chris is calling from Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:25:41.777 --> 01:25:42.457]  Welcome, Chris.
[01:25:43.298 --> 01:25:44.499]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:25:45.902 --> 01:25:55.671]  I just find it interesting that Blackwater USA was founded the same year that the Project for the New American Century was written.
[01:25:56.612 --> 01:26:11.265]  And what I don't understand, what I wanted to ask you is, and you probably know the answer a lot better than I do, but why does the Secretary of Defense and all these other bigwigs, when they're walking around in Iraq, why don't they just have
[01:26:11.804 --> 01:26:12.725]  Regular U.S.
[01:26:12.825 --> 01:26:14.205]  Army troops guard them?
[01:26:14.245 --> 01:26:16.767]  Why do they have to have private contractors?
[01:26:17.747 --> 01:26:21.189]  Why can't they task it out to a Special Forces soldier?
[01:26:21.789 --> 01:26:22.789]  Special Forces team?
[01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:23.530]  Something like that?
[01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:27.632]  That's because those men still to some extent have to follow the law.
[01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:29.071]  Yes, we are.
[01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:51.366]  In Iraq, and I've got articles on it today, they are just 007, licensed to kill.
[01:26:51.786 --> 01:26:53.948]  They're not under the Uniform Military Code.
[01:26:53.968 --> 01:26:56.090]  They're not under Geneva Conventions.
[01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:57.231]  They're not under federal law.
[01:26:57.832 --> 01:27:00.014]  I mean, they really are under law.
[01:27:00.034 --> 01:27:02.756]  They're being paid by our government, but our government is not enforcing it.
[01:27:03.316 --> 01:27:05.358]  And so they're good old-fashioned mercenaries.
[01:27:05.378 --> 01:27:11.304]  Do you know what Caesar... I mean, after Julius Caesar, after B.C., in the A.D.,
[01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:26.095]  In the couple hundred years after Christ on the cross, there in the major decline of Rome, the Caesars always had foreign troops for some reason as his personal praetorian guard.
[01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:32.337]  Because they were far away from home, they were raised as slaves, as young men, and then freed.
[01:27:33.057 --> 01:27:39.820]  And the Caesar would have a guard usually of German, Visigoth troops around him.
[01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:43.257]  I mean that's just it seems that's what they do.
[01:27:43.679 --> 01:27:46.289]  They always have a group of crooks around them.
[01:27:47.026 --> 01:27:55.587]  And you're absolutely right, Mohammed Karzai, all of them, they've got these private little mercenary thugs, but we don't call them mercenaries now, mercs.
[01:27:56.108 --> 01:28:01.709]  That has a bad connotation, or soldier of fortune, or hired thug, or hired killer.
[01:28:02.269 --> 01:28:04.329]  Now they're called private contractors.
[01:28:05.549 --> 01:28:07.269]  They're mercenaries.
[01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:15.951]  Plus it's worse than that, you see these leaders, these Cheneys and others, they all own major stock in these companies, so it's like a gangster has his own force.
[01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:18.151]  Yeah, and that ain't right.
[01:28:18.511 --> 01:28:20.032]  If they're U.S.
[01:28:20.052 --> 01:28:23.495]  political leaders, they should have military protecting them.
[01:28:23.595 --> 01:28:24.335]  Our military.
[01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:26.336]  They don't need to contract it out to mercenaries.
[01:28:29.078 --> 01:28:31.040]  Well, I hear that irritates a lot of military people.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.000]  Does that irritate you?
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.101]  That irritates me.
[01:28:33.621 --> 01:28:34.882]  Anything else you'd like to add, or are you done?
[01:28:35.403 --> 01:28:35.803]  I'm done.
[01:28:35.823 --> 01:28:36.303]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:28:36.403 --> 01:28:36.723]  Thank you.
[01:28:39.705 --> 01:28:40.606]  We're on the march.
[01:28:41.086 --> 01:28:42.707]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:43.608 --> 01:28:46.330]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:52.560]  Government is best which governs me.
[01:28:53.101 --> 01:28:54.422]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:57.564]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:28:58.004 --> 01:29:00.666]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:01.106 --> 01:29:07.491]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:08.071]  I think so.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.840]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:30.361]  Have you?
[01:29:30.941 --> 01:29:32.441]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:36.682]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:29:37.822 --> 01:29:40.663]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:29:41.123 --> 01:29:42.163]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.

[01:30:50.074 --> 01:30:54.715]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:30:54.755 --> 01:30:55.476]  have diabetes.
[01:30:55.816 --> 01:31:02.758]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:31:02.898 --> 01:31:07.439]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:31:07.639 --> 01:31:10.460]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:31:56.349 --> 01:32:02.173]  Alright, I'm going to hold off on calls for a little while now.
[01:32:02.233 --> 01:32:05.476]  I want to play a couple of clips and cover a whole parcel of news.
[01:32:09.238 --> 01:32:11.700]  Then we'll go to Kenny in Maryland and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:15.162]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:32:15.643 --> 01:32:20.606]  Before I get into this news, and a lot of it's Iraq and of course torture news, a lot of it is economic as well.
[01:32:21.587 --> 01:32:23.908]  Before I do that, the holidays are here.
[01:32:23.989 --> 01:32:24.929]  Christmas is here.
[01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:35.437]  And I encourage people not to go into debt, not to go out and buy $150 tennis shoes for your kid, when a $20 pair will do just as good and last longer.
[01:32:35.457 --> 01:32:37.158]  That's my experience.
[01:32:38.133 --> 01:32:48.080]  But I'm not going to sit here, I don't know it all, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what to do, but I know the American people are in record debt, and it's only getting worse, and the economic indices are not very pretty right now.
[01:32:49.041 --> 01:32:59.327]  So, I know this Christmas, I'm not going to give people, even though I could go out and get some gifts, I'm not going to go out and fight the crowds and buy a bunch of junk.
[01:33:00.388 --> 01:33:05.852]  I am giving family books that are anti-New World Order and informative.
[01:33:07.842 --> 01:33:11.144]  I mean, I'm giving people what I recommend you give them.
[01:33:11.824 --> 01:33:13.205]  Codex Magicka!
[01:33:15.026 --> 01:33:18.928]  The Order of Death and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on one DVD.
[01:33:20.569 --> 01:33:25.171]  And I'm also giving them little watercolor paintings that my children have painted framed.
[01:33:25.712 --> 01:33:29.434]  That's the type of gifts I'm giving this Christmas.
[01:33:30.094 --> 01:33:33.736]  And folks, we have slashed prices on the videos.
[01:33:34.981 --> 01:33:36.261]  Why go out and fight crowds?
[01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:46.083]  Why give them nose hair trimmers, or curling irons, or the water massage thing that you put your feet in the bucket that costs $100?
[01:33:46.583 --> 01:33:47.763]  Why buy the junk?
[01:33:47.783 --> 01:33:54.024]  I mean, frankly, every year, friends and family give me gifts, and I hope they're listening, and I tell them every year, I don't want stuff on my birthday.
[01:33:54.425 --> 01:33:55.585]  I don't want stuff at Christmas.
[01:33:56.105 --> 01:33:56.945]  I hate things.
[01:33:57.105 --> 01:34:00.086]  I don't like having to open boxes and then cram them in closets.
[01:34:00.486 --> 01:34:02.226]  I have a garage full of junk.
[01:34:03.743 --> 01:34:05.826]  I mean, I'm not into things, folks.
[01:34:05.846 --> 01:34:06.627]  I'm into people.
[01:34:07.007 --> 01:34:08.069]  I'm into ideas.
[01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:12.073]  I'm into being able to spend time with my friends and family.
[01:34:12.915 --> 01:34:16.519]  Again, we've totally gotten what Christmas is supposed to be about backwards.
[01:34:18.101 --> 01:34:22.587]  I haven't done this in many, many years, but back when I had more time, I would go volunteer
[01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:26.932]  With the Salvation Army on Christmas Day, you ought to do that.
[01:34:26.952 --> 01:34:28.432]  It's more rewarding.
[01:34:28.472 --> 01:34:30.033]  It's not some bleeding heart thing.
[01:34:30.713 --> 01:34:36.656]  Sitting around getting fat and drinking wassail full of rum is not fun, folks.
[01:34:37.476 --> 01:34:40.998]  And opening a bunch of stuff you don't even want.
[01:34:41.018 --> 01:34:42.759]  I mean, if I want something, I'll go buy it.
[01:34:42.779 --> 01:34:45.080]  If I want a pair of boots, I'm going to get it myself, because I know what I want.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.381]  Now, obviously, kids are different.
[01:34:47.401 --> 01:34:49.001]  They want toys and things, and it's fine.
[01:34:49.041 --> 01:34:52.423]  But still, they'd rather you just spend time with them.
[01:34:52.850 --> 01:35:00.597]  Instead of giving them a bunch of expensive junk, say, hey, I'm going to work a little less and just take you fishing, or take you hiking more, or go see more of your baseball games.
[01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:04.980]  Again, I meant to just plug my videos, but now I'm preaching about this.
[01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:07.202]  And again, it's not that I'm some expert.
[01:35:07.262 --> 01:35:08.664]  It's common sense.
[01:35:08.704 --> 01:35:09.745]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:13.027]  Stay focused this holiday on what the season is all about.
[01:35:13.148 --> 01:35:18.572]  Love, forgiving, sharing, giving, loving your family.
[01:35:18.652 --> 01:35:19.573]  That's what it's all about.
[01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:20.514]  And realize this holiday
[01:35:21.434 --> 01:35:22.475]  All this is under attack.
[01:35:22.615 --> 01:35:24.157]  All this is going to be taken away.
[01:35:24.577 --> 01:35:26.019]  Very soon if we don't turn this around.
[01:35:26.859 --> 01:35:27.800]  I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:31.264]  They're already trying to arrest people at schools and fire them.
[01:35:31.964 --> 01:35:36.649]  And now saying Christmas is hateful and taking a Bible to school.
[01:35:36.689 --> 01:35:37.370]  You get arrested.
[01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:39.752]  I mean, we're turning into the Soviet Union.
[01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.277]  And so this holiday, folks, don't go fight the crowds.
[01:35:44.317 --> 01:35:46.398]  Don't go battle the crazies.
[01:35:46.558 --> 01:35:49.239]  Don't go buy junk no one wants.
[01:35:49.919 --> 01:35:51.419]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:35:51.459 --> 01:35:52.840]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.721]  Order one of my videos.
[01:35:54.841 --> 01:35:56.881]  Make copies of them and give those as gifts.
[01:35:57.642 --> 01:35:59.122]  Burn copies of the DVD.
[01:36:00.563 --> 01:36:01.103]  The new film.
[01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:02.543]  Give them to people.
[01:36:03.644 --> 01:36:04.364]  It's that simple.
[01:36:05.664 --> 01:36:10.346]  Or if you want to give somebody the original with a nice color cover and a little hard case and the shrink wrap.
[01:36:12.085 --> 01:36:21.249]  We're selling the new film, two films on one, The Order of Death, The Elite History of the Bohemian Grove, The Skull and Bones Tie-In, Going Back to the Illuminati in Egypt and Babylon.
[01:36:21.729 --> 01:36:31.594]  That's 45 minutes long, that new documentary with The Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the original re-updated for 2005, updated with all this new information.
[01:36:32.074 --> 01:36:33.895]  Two films on one DVD or one VHS.
[01:36:35.573 --> 01:36:39.354]  And it's $24.95 each additional $9.95.
[01:36:39.954 --> 01:36:40.814]  Why are we doing that?
[01:36:40.894 --> 01:36:43.715]  So you can get 4 or 5 copies and give them as gifts.
[01:36:44.275 --> 01:36:47.175]  My t-shirts instead of $20 are $9.95 right now.
[01:36:48.615 --> 01:36:53.736]  And there's deals on all the other videos and all the other books and all the other things I carry.
[01:36:55.037 --> 01:36:57.737]  I mean on the t-shirts folks, they're made in America.
[01:36:57.757 --> 01:37:00.658]  So I pay as much as $6 for an extra extra large.
[01:37:01.158 --> 01:37:02.838]  I might pay $4.50 for just a medium.
[01:37:03.695 --> 01:37:06.716]  I can get them from Mexico for about $2, from China for about $1.50.
[01:37:06.836 --> 01:37:08.217]  Of course, they fall apart.
[01:37:08.257 --> 01:37:10.818]  These are heavy, nice, good t-shirts.
[01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:15.040]  And we got a whole bunch of them, and they're $9.95, and they all got a political message.
[01:37:16.661 --> 01:37:18.001]  It's all about getting the word out.
[01:37:18.261 --> 01:37:25.625]  So please go to InfoWars.com and order the books, the videos, the books on tape, the t-shirts, off the SecureSafe shopping cart.
[01:37:25.665 --> 01:37:30.907]  Look at all the specials, watch free clips of the films, read about them, and you're done shopping for the year!
[01:37:31.562 --> 01:37:36.808]  You can go right there if you're going to give gifts this holiday season and you can get those and you can give them to people.
[01:37:39.371 --> 01:37:48.922]  I say if you get kids, you get a bunch of paints together and go get a bunch of rocks out of the riverbed and paint things on them and then just give them to people and if your family doesn't like that more than a nose hair trimmer, something's wrong with them.
[01:37:49.867 --> 01:37:51.029]  That's the kind of gift I like.
[01:37:51.209 --> 01:37:52.831]  I want an oil painting somebody painted me.
[01:37:53.432 --> 01:37:57.798]  I want a fruit basket that somebody put together for me.
[01:37:57.918 --> 01:38:00.342]  I do not want, do not give me anything.
[01:38:00.402 --> 01:38:01.523]  People send me quilts.
[01:38:01.623 --> 01:38:03.426]  I mean, listeners, you are the best.
[01:38:03.706 --> 01:38:05.809]  Stuff like that I like because I could end up using that.
[01:38:05.829 --> 01:38:06.350]  My grandmother
[01:38:07.139 --> 01:38:07.800]  We're good to go.
[01:38:20.914 --> 01:38:22.035]  It's about giving, folks.
[01:38:22.155 --> 01:38:29.038]  I enjoy giving, so I hope that you will get the films and give them to people and make copies of them.
[01:38:29.078 --> 01:38:33.119]  That's my little gift to you, is there's no copyright for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:38:33.439 --> 01:38:35.961]  So, InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:38:35.981 --> 01:38:37.841]  And we ship these out to you UPS.
[01:38:37.881 --> 01:38:39.222]  We ship these out to you UPS.
[01:38:49.347 --> 01:38:54.928]  And so they get to you pretty quick, but you need to order them in the next few weeks if you want to get them before Christmas, so you can give them as gifts.
[01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:59.050]  So 1-888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:39:09.642 --> 01:39:13.164]  And in the New Year, there's going to be a new address that you can write to us at.
[01:39:13.304 --> 01:39:14.384]  You'll even be able to visit us at.
[01:39:14.424 --> 01:39:20.107]  It should be up in the bookstore by the New Year here off of South Lamar.
[01:39:20.607 --> 01:39:22.908]  New address on a side street right off South Lamar.
[01:39:22.928 --> 01:39:28.591]  But for now, it's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:39:30.071 --> 01:39:33.253]  And in the New Year, I would also ask listeners to do something that's very important.
[01:39:34.444 --> 01:39:36.386]  It is such an incredible blessing.
[01:39:36.546 --> 01:39:37.367]  I am so honored.
[01:39:37.427 --> 01:39:38.307]  I am so humbled.
[01:39:38.547 --> 01:39:40.369]  It blows me away.
[01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:43.191]  It makes me think, man, I've got to do a better job.
[01:39:43.251 --> 01:39:45.413]  I've got to pay attention to what I'm doing.
[01:39:45.453 --> 01:39:46.694]  I've got to be more eloquent.
[01:39:47.054 --> 01:39:48.315]  I've got to be more learned.
[01:39:48.335 --> 01:39:51.918]  I mean, so many AM and FM stations are picking us up.
[01:39:52.359 --> 01:39:53.539]  So many news stations.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:40:02.707]  And I think about the stations like WBCR carrying us for five plus years in Tennessee, or KCXL carrying us for five, is it six years?
[01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:05.551]  In Kansas City, the great job they're doing.
[01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:09.652]  I think about just all of the affiliates out there.
[01:40:10.112 --> 01:40:13.253]  The Sunshine Network, three stations up in upstate New York.
[01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:19.034]  I think about all the stations that are carrying us, two of them in the Chicago area, several others in Illinois.
[01:40:19.054 --> 01:40:29.456]  I think about just the stations in California, stations in New Mexico, stations all over the place carrying this broadcast.
[01:40:30.305 --> 01:40:56.154]  And I just want to tell the listeners that it is such a big deal to be able to break through that electronic Berlin Wall and that people listening on their AM and FM radios from Austin to Kansas City to Chicago, right in the middle of the country, to Pensacola, Florida, to all over, can tune in and can actually hear the truth and can actually learn what's happening.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:04.364]  The conversion rate we have of people that finally hear the truth, most of them laugh at me at first, then they go check out what I'm saying and they find out it's true, it's around 90%.
[01:41:08.605 --> 01:41:16.769]  And so please, if you're a business owner, sponsor my show or any show, I don't care.
[01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:24.453]  Sponsor one that's less controversial, but tell that station I'm sponsoring your morning drive show because you're carrying Alex Jones.
[01:41:25.816 --> 01:41:26.816]  It doesn't matter where you put it.
[01:41:27.196 --> 01:41:28.497]  In this show, you're going to have the audience.
[01:41:31.257 --> 01:41:34.078]  Sponsor it, because I want to thank those stations.
[01:41:35.978 --> 01:41:39.259]  If you're a listener, call those sponsors and tell them thank you.
[01:41:39.279 --> 01:41:40.939]  Call the station and tell them thank you.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.441]  Because to not just hold on to the stations we have, but to be growing.
[01:41:49.161 --> 01:41:50.782]  Frankly, I'll be honest with you.
[01:41:51.342 --> 01:41:52.402]  I lost stations.
[01:41:53.476 --> 01:42:05.801]  I went on the air on 9-11, I knew without a shadow of a doubt, I'd bet every dime I own, and I'm not a gambler, I'd stick my head in the guillotine and stake my life on it, that I knew it was an inside op by criminal elements.
[01:42:06.441 --> 01:42:13.803]  It was hard to come out with all the evidence and the facts day one, to hit the barbed wire first, and I am proud of that.
[01:42:13.823 --> 01:42:15.144]  It's one of the few things I'm actually proud of.
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:28.865]  That I have trailblazed in so many avenues in this fight, but it brings me to tears to think about what you did, how you looked at the evidence, how you believed me, how you stood up, how many of you stuck with me.
[01:42:28.945 --> 01:42:33.667]  I'm surprised anybody could just let that type of hardcore info out.
[01:42:33.927 --> 01:42:34.588]  Now it's passé.
[01:42:36.158 --> 01:42:40.200]  Now it's discussed in magazines, newspapers, all over talk radio.
[01:42:40.961 --> 01:42:48.685]  It is the majority view in major CNN polls, major polls by Zogby.
[01:42:49.725 --> 01:42:52.106]  It is in major Gannett polls.
[01:42:53.347 --> 01:42:56.989]  Now, we really have been winning.
[01:42:59.210 --> 01:43:00.311]  Now that doesn't mean
[01:43:01.827 --> 01:43:13.372]  That overnight there may not be a terror attack and then you're going to hear, see we told you, you wouldn't let us take all your freedoms so now the terrorists were able to attack and you just better shut up and let us have all your freedoms.
[01:43:13.773 --> 01:43:20.016]  That's when we all got to throw ourselves against the gates when the intruders are trying to batter them down and hold against them.
[01:43:20.436 --> 01:43:23.057]  If they break down the gate, fight them right there in the gap.
[01:43:26.195 --> 01:43:31.437]  It's going to get worse each time they launch an attack because they're getting weaker, folks.
[01:43:31.797 --> 01:43:32.897]  They're getting discovered.
[01:43:34.998 --> 01:43:38.599]  Frankly, in my optimistic view, I knew we could do what we've done.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:40.220]  You.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:40.940]  Because of you.
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:48.583]  Make no mistake, folks, those of you that got Road to Tyranny, the emergency release three weeks after 9-11 took place, and made thousands of copies and gave it to people,
[01:43:50.077 --> 01:43:51.078]  We were the zenith.
[01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:52.700]  We set the mold.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:55.202]  We laid down the parameters.
[01:43:55.543 --> 01:43:59.106]  We shifted a massive paradigm globally.
[01:43:59.386 --> 01:44:00.528]  The paradigm has shifted.
[01:44:00.948 --> 01:44:06.574]  Now, while I'm still trying to figure out if the London bombing is a government op, while I'm still
[01:44:07.597 --> 01:44:12.219]  You know, two weeks after it happened, still open-minded and saying, well, the evidence points towards that.
[01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:16.480]  But, you know, I don't sit there and just run out because my view is they're behind it.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:23.082]  Just because their motive, just because they have the motive and the capacity and the past activities of doing it, certainly they were the number one suspects.
[01:44:23.102 --> 01:44:25.023]  But I wasn't declaring a government off.
[01:44:25.703 --> 01:44:32.966]  Then we got Sterling just red-handed, open and shut, 100% evidence, now it is proven.
[01:44:34.207 --> 01:44:35.969]  When major newspapers were saying it.
[01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:40.573]  I mean, we've gone to where I'm passe, folks.
[01:44:42.214 --> 01:44:43.075]  And that feels good.
[01:44:43.135 --> 01:44:44.496]  Let me tell you.
[01:44:45.857 --> 01:44:47.519]  But there's also a problem.
[01:44:47.539 --> 01:44:49.280]  There's other people who want to be cutting edge.
[01:44:51.062 --> 01:44:54.325]  So they'll run out and say stuff immediately before they have evidence.
[01:44:54.525 --> 01:44:57.808]  Or they'll just say something radical and ridiculous just to be shocking.
[01:44:57.848 --> 01:45:01.211]  They don't understand trailblazing means you're actually going somewhere.
[01:45:02.466 --> 01:45:06.449]  And is it trailblazing to jump down a mine shaft a thousand feet deep and kill yourself?
[01:45:06.729 --> 01:45:07.590]  It's because it's different.
[01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:15.515]  It's trailblazing to say, I'm Lewis and Clark, and we're going to walk across a continent that nobody's ever done before.
[01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:17.136]  Not even the natives.
[01:45:19.678 --> 01:45:20.639]  That's trailblazing.
[01:45:21.299 --> 01:45:28.384]  Saying that you're going to go set up colonies in Virginia in the 1600s, that's trailblazing.
[01:45:29.275 --> 01:45:34.097]  And I'm not trying to compare what I've done to that, what you as a movement have done.
[01:45:35.377 --> 01:45:39.619]  All I did was provide the spark, and there were many other sparks going off at the same time.
[01:45:40.479 --> 01:45:46.921]  All I did was provide the spark, and look at the fire, look at how it's raging and burning down the New World Order right now.
[01:45:49.302 --> 01:45:50.403]  They are afraid.
[01:45:51.023 --> 01:45:52.964]  You know, all these globalists are panicking.
[01:45:54.504 --> 01:45:56.745]  The current Federal Reserve Chairman, the incoming one,
[01:45:58.883 --> 01:46:25.773]  All these big financial experts, Warren Buffett, they all tried to plunge the dollar, they all tried to at the same time plunge gold, they all tried at the same time to do a whole host of things to the economic landscape and now things they wanted to do, the dollar's still in a lot of trouble and will go down even more eventually, but now gold's exploding while the dollar goes back up.
[01:46:26.824 --> 01:46:27.505]  Substantively?
[01:46:27.545 --> 01:46:28.345]  I mean that's unheard of.
[01:46:28.645 --> 01:46:30.827]  They're losing control and they're saying it.
[01:46:31.087 --> 01:46:33.949]  They're going, a billion Chinese are buying gold and we can't control it.
[01:46:33.989 --> 01:46:35.591]  Americans are buying and we can't control it.
[01:46:35.851 --> 01:46:38.713]  The central banks told you not to buy it over and over again.
[01:46:38.733 --> 01:46:46.719]  For the last decade they've been selling it to each other at reduced prices to artificially drive down.
[01:46:46.919 --> 01:46:48.380]  But now no one's listening to them.
[01:46:49.381 --> 01:46:53.244]  They order the cops and the firemen and women
[01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:55.555]  To go and take smallpox shots?
[01:46:55.595 --> 01:46:57.276]  They universally say no.
[01:46:57.296 --> 01:46:57.777]  99 plus percent.
[01:46:58.217 --> 01:46:59.339]  They order people to do this.
[01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:00.179]  They order them to do that.
[01:47:00.219 --> 01:47:00.960]  They don't follow it.
[01:47:01.341 --> 01:47:03.943]  They order border patrol section chiefs not to arrest illegals.
[01:47:04.244 --> 01:47:08.688]  The chiefs refuse, get fired, then the whole border patrol system gets shaken up and they get in trouble.
[01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:11.972]  They're losing on so many fronts.
[01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:18.572]  And some people say, oh, the New World Order is omnipresent and they can't be stopped.
[01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.373]  No, folks, we're just a speck.
[01:47:20.393 --> 01:47:30.920]  Remember that rant about how we're this tiny little planet orbiting a little sun of hundreds of billions of suns in our own little galaxy of which there's hundreds of billions of galaxies that have been photographed.
[01:47:32.401 --> 01:47:37.744]  I mean, this government, the New World Order, the dark forces in our universe, they are not omnipresent.
[01:47:37.785 --> 01:47:39.526]  They are not all-powerful.
[01:47:39.866 --> 01:47:40.666]  They are flawed.
[01:47:40.706 --> 01:47:41.427]  They will fail.
[01:47:42.797 --> 01:47:44.177]  Good things can happen.
[01:47:44.657 --> 01:47:46.118]  We can be given reprieves.
[01:47:46.898 --> 01:47:49.998]  But the New World Order took over the churches and told you, no, there's nothing you can do.
[01:47:50.058 --> 01:47:50.438]  Lay down.
[01:47:50.478 --> 01:47:51.398]  It's the end of the world.
[01:47:52.099 --> 01:47:54.579]  Just pray to Jesus when he appears in Jerusalem.
[01:47:54.599 --> 01:47:55.899]  That's the Antichrist, folks.
[01:47:56.419 --> 01:47:57.640]  This is so sick.
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.260]  Take your microchip.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.021]  Biometrics aren't the mark of the beast.
[01:48:04.061 --> 01:48:04.881]  Go ahead and do it.
[01:48:04.921 --> 01:48:05.441]  It's good.
[01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:07.541]  Next up on the 700 Club.
[01:48:10.482 --> 01:48:11.862]  So I know I'm ranting and raving.
[01:48:11.922 --> 01:48:12.482]  It's just that
[01:48:14.312 --> 01:48:17.715]  These are the times that try men and women's souls.
[01:48:18.556 --> 01:48:23.120]  These are, but it's also very exciting and we know we can have an effect in history.
[01:48:23.481 --> 01:48:29.466]  Look, the tiny elite was able to seize control because they were patient and calculating and look at all the bad things they're doing.
[01:48:29.686 --> 01:48:31.328]  But look at all the good things we can do.
[01:48:32.289 --> 01:48:34.391]  And I said change ourselves at the cellular level.
[01:48:34.431 --> 01:48:35.391]  People misunderstood me last week.
[01:48:35.431 --> 01:48:38.735]  I don't mean in some yogi way of physically our bodies changing.
[01:48:38.835 --> 01:48:39.095]  I mean
[01:48:40.055 --> 01:48:43.618]  I'm as an individual, I'm a cell in a larger human community.
[01:48:44.178 --> 01:49:00.730]  And if we individually make ourselves good, if we individually stop being bad, if we individually ask God in our hearts, if we individually get involved and start giving and start standing up against evil and stop caring what our dumbed down neighbors, TV heads think, and we start standing up and telling the truth and having moral courage,
[01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:01.891]  It's always hard.
[01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:10.761]  You know the old scenes in movies where they got to go do some tough job, scale the mountain, scale the machine gun nest, and the sergeant says, all right, all the men that want to volunteer to go with me step forward.
[01:49:10.781 --> 01:49:11.402]  Nobody does.
[01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:14.385]  And finally, one guy steps forward, and then two, then five, then ten.
[01:49:14.405 --> 01:49:15.847]  Then they all step forward.
[01:49:16.047 --> 01:49:20.432]  And one little coward is afraid to step forward, but as they climb up the mountain, he finally shows up.
[01:49:20.892 --> 01:49:22.013]  In his gear, ready to go.
[01:49:22.213 --> 01:49:24.314]  Those are based on real stories, true stories.
[01:49:24.614 --> 01:49:26.475]  You've got to be the one to step forward first.
[01:49:26.635 --> 01:49:28.256]  You've got to hit the barbed wire first.
[01:49:28.416 --> 01:49:30.357]  You've got to charge the machine gun nest first.
[01:49:30.377 --> 01:49:31.218]  You've got to do it!
[01:49:31.438 --> 01:49:32.899]  Because this is for all the marbles.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.560]  This is for everything.
[01:49:36.181 --> 01:49:37.581]  This is not a game, folks.
[01:49:38.042 --> 01:49:41.584]  Psychopathic evil killers are in control.
[01:49:41.824 --> 01:49:43.445]  They want to do horrible things to you.
[01:49:43.485 --> 01:49:44.825]  They've said they will openly.
[01:49:45.006 --> 01:49:46.706]  They must be resisted.
[01:49:46.767 --> 01:49:47.647]  It is your duty.
[01:49:47.947 --> 01:49:48.407]  Fight them!
[01:49:50.976 --> 01:49:53.839]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:54.079 --> 01:49:55.660]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:56.001 --> 01:50:00.685]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:01.026 --> 01:50:07.772]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:08.092 --> 01:50:10.054]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:10.274 --> 01:50:13.116]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:13.216 --> 01:50:17.880]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.483]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:22.724 --> 01:50:29.949]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:32.631]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:32.772 --> 01:50:34.513]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:50.063 --> 01:50:53.085]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:53.385 --> 01:50:58.309]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:02.932]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:03.232 --> 01:51:12.138]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:12.358 --> 01:51:15.981]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:16.261 --> 01:51:21.290]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:28.322]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:28.803 --> 01:51:29.343]  What about you?
[01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:35.446]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:36.667 --> 01:51:38.548]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:51:51.357 --> 01:51:51.697]  I think so.
[01:52:06.602 --> 01:52:07.243]  We're good to go!
[01:52:36.121 --> 01:52:39.207]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:39.367 --> 01:52:45.237]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:50.906 --> 01:52:56.091]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:56.731 --> 01:52:59.073]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:52:59.093 --> 01:53:01.455]  Alright, let's keep one thing straight.
[01:53:01.496 --> 01:53:02.977]  I'm not jealous of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:53:02.997 --> 01:53:03.958]  I don't envy him.
[01:53:03.978 --> 01:53:06.360]  I grew up admiring him.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.602]  I mean, I was listening to Rush Limbaugh, folks, in high school.
[01:53:09.502 --> 01:53:10.603]  When he first went on air.
[01:53:12.505 --> 01:53:12.845]  Alright?
[01:53:13.526 --> 01:53:14.487]  Maybe when I was about a senior.
[01:53:15.296 --> 01:53:16.237]  Just like Paul Harvey.
[01:53:16.277 --> 01:53:19.100]  Paul Harvey gets on air and says, we had blacks as slaves.
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:20.161]  We killed the Indians.
[01:53:20.241 --> 01:53:20.961]  It was good.
[01:53:21.482 --> 01:53:22.663]  Let's nuke all the Arabs.
[01:53:22.723 --> 01:53:24.084]  I mean, that's sick and crazy.
[01:53:25.706 --> 01:53:28.428]  I mean, and it's totally divorced from reality.
[01:53:29.289 --> 01:53:30.931]  And I've admired Rush Limbaugh.
[01:53:30.971 --> 01:53:36.116]  He was different, too, 15 years ago when I was a senior in high school.
[01:53:38.438 --> 01:53:39.058]  I'm in my low 30s.
[01:53:40.792 --> 01:53:43.473]  And he has really changed so much, folks.
[01:53:43.533 --> 01:53:46.713]  I mean, 100 pills a day, that would kill 7 horses, they did a calculation.
[01:53:47.753 --> 01:53:50.274]  But let's put all the kids in jail who use drugs, but not him.
[01:53:50.294 --> 01:53:52.014]  It's just so sick.
[01:53:52.354 --> 01:53:56.415]  So I'm not here attacking Rush Limbaugh for the person he once was.
[01:53:56.455 --> 01:53:59.496]  He just has gotten to be a totally disturbing individual.
[01:54:00.016 --> 01:54:03.477]  But maybe we've become so warped as a country that he just kind of warped with the times.
[01:54:03.517 --> 01:54:04.337]  Or maybe I've changed.
[01:54:04.357 --> 01:54:04.837]  I don't know.
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.902]  But, but, I don't care if they're Christian peace activists, you know, so what?
[01:54:08.962 --> 01:54:09.542]  It's funny.
[01:54:09.862 --> 01:54:12.343]  I play this for critique and analysis purposes.
[01:54:12.604 --> 01:54:14.104]  We're just going to play about 30 seconds of it.
[01:54:14.124 --> 01:54:14.905]  Here's Rush Limbaugh.
[01:54:15.965 --> 01:54:23.629]  I said at the conclusion of previous hours, part of me that likes this, and some of you might say, Rush, that's horrible.
[01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:25.430]  Peace activists taken hostage.
[01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:26.831]  Well, here's why I like it.
[01:54:27.331 --> 01:54:33.094]  I like any time a bunch of leftist feel-good-angry-ers are shown reality.
[01:54:34.699 --> 01:54:37.122]  So here we have these peace activists over there.
[01:54:37.142 --> 01:54:38.283]  I don't know if they're Christian or not.
[01:54:38.663 --> 01:54:43.007]  They're over there, and as peace activists, they've got one purpose.
[01:54:43.628 --> 01:54:46.011]  They're over there trying to stop the violence.
[01:54:47.112 --> 01:54:48.333]  Now, if this German group
[01:54:49.267 --> 01:54:54.188]  Fits the mold, they are probably blaming the United States and Polish enforcers for all of this.
[01:54:54.708 --> 01:55:04.951]  Okay, so understand folks, Rush Limbaugh, and again, if he got it because he owns oil wells or he got it because he invented a widget, that's fine, but no, the guy got it doing what he does on the radio.
[01:55:05.451 --> 01:55:08.572]  Four hundred million dollars is what he's got currently.
[01:55:09.352 --> 01:55:12.333]  Four hundred million dollars.
[01:55:13.153 --> 01:55:18.034]  Sitting there in a cush little studio down the street from his house outside Miami,
[01:55:19.534 --> 01:55:22.075]  Another Kush studio in New York, but he normally lives in Miami.
[01:55:23.976 --> 01:55:26.257]  The peace activists are the real ones.
[01:55:26.457 --> 01:55:28.198]  They're the ones getting kidnapped by our government.
[01:55:28.218 --> 01:55:32.760]  We've caught our government, the criminals that run it, doing it and killing them to scare them off.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:46.606]  These are people, Christians, these are not leftist groups, this particular group is not, who actually go over there and live outside the green zone and who are bombed and killed and see the dead kids and believe me, buddy, they're living it.
[01:55:47.186 --> 01:55:53.735]  You're not living it, literally, on 100 synthetic heroin pills a day.
[01:55:53.755 --> 01:55:55.257]  You admittedly were taking that many.
[01:55:55.538 --> 01:55:57.480]  I mean, folks, that is unbelievable.
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.504]  His liver must bounce like a basketball off the ground.
[01:56:00.925 --> 01:56:02.928]  I mean, that is just ultra-massive tolerance.
[01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.904]  And again, I don't think Rush Limbaugh should get in trouble for that.
[01:56:06.404 --> 01:56:07.824]  I don't use drugs other than caffeine.
[01:56:07.844 --> 01:56:08.944]  I just had a big cup of coffee.
[01:56:09.524 --> 01:56:15.606]  I don't use drugs, but I'll tell you this, folks, I don't think people should be put in prison for them because they're shipped in to then put your kids in prison.
[01:56:16.106 --> 01:56:19.987]  But he thinks your kid should be, but he's on it, but then he shouldn't be.
[01:56:20.047 --> 01:56:22.588]  He should have the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but you shouldn't.
[01:56:22.788 --> 01:56:27.589]  And he sits there in the lamp of $400 million when these people go to Iraq.
[01:56:27.909 --> 01:56:28.509]  I'm not going!
[01:56:30.538 --> 01:56:33.559]  Because I'll tell you folks, I'm afraid I would have my work cut short.
[01:56:33.579 --> 01:56:34.479]  I'm not afraid of being killed.
[01:56:34.519 --> 01:56:35.439]  It actually sounds thrilling.
[01:56:35.739 --> 01:56:36.379]  I like danger.
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:37.920]  I'm kind of a thrill seeker.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:41.901]  But I think I have more important work to do here than to risk myself over there.
[01:56:41.921 --> 01:56:44.821]  They would probably for sure, the government would kill me if I went over there.
[01:56:44.841 --> 01:56:47.642]  It would be a perfect theater to do it and claim I was killed by insurgents.
[01:56:47.882 --> 01:56:51.863]  You'd probably see me on TV having my head shot off by the CIA and they'd say it was Al Qaeda.
[01:56:52.883 --> 01:56:54.224]  So it just makes me sad.
[01:56:55.164 --> 01:56:57.584]  Oh, they're just blowing off steam at Abu Ghraib.
[01:56:57.604 --> 01:56:58.785]  Yeah, raping and killing people.
[01:56:58.825 --> 01:56:59.985]  We play this clip where he says that.
[01:57:01.257 --> 01:57:06.839]  Oh, a part of me likes this, and he goes on to explain why, because they're undermining the war effort, and now they're finding out what it's really like.
[01:57:08.259 --> 01:57:13.321]  Statistically, it's probably Iraqi soldiers under coalition orders doing this.
[01:57:14.841 --> 01:57:21.844]  It could be real terrorists, and it could just as likely be the peace activist staging it.
[01:57:22.844 --> 01:57:25.405]  The point is, though, you don't get off on it.
[01:57:25.445 --> 01:57:26.285]  It's not enjoyable.
[01:57:29.429 --> 01:57:33.974]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:33.994 --> 01:57:34.074]  Nope.
[01:57:34.094 --> 01:57:34.574]  Big Brother.
[01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:35.535]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:35.575 --> 01:57:40.260]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.221 --> 01:57:43.423]  You want answers?
[01:57:43.663 --> 01:57:45.145]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.926 --> 01:57:57.549]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.109 --> 01:58:02.212]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.853 --> 01:58:04.853]  Listen to this.
[01:58:07.615 --> 01:58:10.577]  You have a view that men shouldn't marry men.
[01:58:10.597 --> 01:58:16.781]  And again, whether you agree with our history with it, it should be able to be your own personal view.
[01:58:16.961 --> 01:58:17.582]  You get fired.
[01:58:20.575 --> 01:58:22.677]  You see, this is the attack on free speech in America.
[01:58:22.697 --> 01:58:23.817]  Well, how about this one?
[01:58:23.897 --> 01:58:26.519]  Or you're a teacher who's anti-Bush, so you get fired.
[01:58:26.539 --> 01:58:27.280]  How about that?
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.201]  See, it's everybody losing their free speech.
[01:58:29.801 --> 01:58:31.022]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:58:31.042 --> 01:58:31.983]  We're going to get him on.
[01:58:32.003 --> 01:58:34.064]  And I've got a sneaking suspicion.
[01:58:34.104 --> 01:58:39.368]  I don't know this yet, but I've got a sneaking suspicion, because we're on a station that goes into Knoxville, WBCR.
[01:58:39.468 --> 01:58:44.011]  I've got a sneaking suspicion, I've said it three times, that he's going to be a listener.
[01:58:44.131 --> 01:58:45.072]  We're going to get him on.
[01:58:45.092 --> 01:58:45.592]  AP.
[01:58:46.193 --> 01:58:49.595]  Opinions on end of days Illuminati gets man fired.
[01:58:50.876 --> 01:58:53.779]  He was the General Manager of the Big Cable Company.
[01:58:56.001 --> 01:58:56.822]  And they fired him.
[01:58:57.583 --> 01:58:59.805]  And I think greater doors are going to open for this man.
[01:59:00.346 --> 01:59:02.728]  Every time I've been fired for not shutting up, I've been blessed.
[01:59:03.649 --> 01:59:06.071]  And please don't give me some Jobian test, Lord.
[01:59:06.131 --> 01:59:07.012]  I don't think I need it.
[01:59:07.453 --> 01:59:10.576]  The Knoxville General Manager of Canology, Inc.
[01:59:12.438 --> 01:59:13.219]  I pronounced that right?
[01:59:13.239 --> 01:59:14.239]  I haven't pronounced much right.
[01:59:14.279 --> 01:59:23.386]  Was fired after he repeatedly appeared in local media espousing his beliefs in a coming apocalypse and a shadowy, all-power, full-secret organization called the Illuminati.
[01:59:24.186 --> 01:59:27.428]  Well, it's not even secret or all... or shadowy now.
[01:59:27.488 --> 01:59:31.591]  I mean, it's just... They're openly calling for world government.
[01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:32.752]  I mean, it's just out in the open.
[01:59:34.462 --> 01:59:41.364]  John Gilmore, 34, has worked for the West Point, Georgia-based cable television internet access provider for the past five years.
[01:59:41.644 --> 01:59:51.107]  In a column published Tuesday in the Knoxville News Sentinel, and in subsequent interviews on local TV stations, Gilmore said the number 11 holds significance, and he went into all of it.
[01:59:53.088 --> 01:59:59.310]  And of course, they just picked out one little thing he said about how the Globals are obsessed with numerology, and that got him fired, basically.
[01:59:59.730 --> 02:00:02.991]  And he says that it's going to be a blessing, and that he's not worried about it, and that
[02:00:03.843 --> 02:00:06.824]  And he was sure God had told him he was going to have to move on soon.
[02:00:07.224 --> 02:00:11.546]  That's the manager of the big cable and internet company there in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[02:00:12.206 --> 02:00:26.271]  You see, what are you going to do when it's so many professors, so many members of Congress, so many top economists for Reagan, Charlotte Isserby, you know, all these other people, and number two, the Department of Education.
[02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:30.453]  I mean, people are defecting in droves, going public, speaking out.
[02:00:31.414 --> 02:00:32.495]  You can't stop us.
[02:00:32.535 --> 02:00:33.796]  You can't stop us all.
[02:00:34.497 --> 02:00:35.918]  And he's all being nice about it.
[02:00:36.839 --> 02:00:42.424]  If you've got business with this company and you're listening to Knoxville, you need to pull it out right now.
[02:00:43.444 --> 02:00:45.206]  And go with whatever company is available.
[02:00:47.848 --> 02:00:49.790]  I mean, this is absolutely outrageous.
[02:00:50.010 --> 02:00:53.093]  He needs to sue them for wrongful termination.
[02:00:53.133 --> 02:00:54.354]  He needs discrimination.
[02:00:55.425 --> 02:01:05.449]  I guarantee you, if he took on being a yogi and started giving interviews outside of his work, which he's allowed to do, about how he's a yogi, they wouldn't care.
[02:01:05.469 --> 02:01:19.054]  If he said that he was, you know, the second coming of the turtle or whatever, or the 14th coming of Amon-Ra, or the 12th Buddha, or the 14th Hobgoblin, there'd be no problem with that.
[02:01:20.294 --> 02:01:24.376]  But if he starts talking about a new world order and he's prominent, bye-bye, baby!
[02:01:26.784 --> 02:01:29.065]  And it's admitted that he was doing well for the company.
[02:01:29.085 --> 02:01:29.846]  That wasn't the problem.
[02:01:29.866 --> 02:01:30.846]  It was just his views.
[02:01:31.306 --> 02:01:32.007]  You need to go.
[02:01:33.948 --> 02:01:34.168]  Hmm.
[02:01:35.309 --> 02:01:36.649]  So that's the kind of news I got here.
[02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:37.790]  I'll read more of it when we get back.
[02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:41.052]  Also, oh, there's just so much.
[02:01:41.392 --> 02:01:41.992]  There's so much.
[02:01:42.232 --> 02:01:43.753]  I've got this video of General
[02:01:44.688 --> 02:01:47.269]  Correcting Rumsfeld on torture in a surprising event.
[02:01:47.329 --> 02:01:51.489]  General Pace actually corrected Rumsfeld publicly over policy.
[02:01:51.549 --> 02:01:53.090]  Let's hope his job isn't in jeopardy.
[02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:55.130]  And it's off the internet from video.
[02:01:55.170 --> 02:01:58.951]  Sometimes video clips aren't the best audio, but it's audible.
[02:01:58.991 --> 02:01:59.771]  You can understand it.
[02:01:59.791 --> 02:02:04.812]  For some reason, sometimes when we download something, it doesn't even sound as good as it did off the internet.
[02:02:04.832 --> 02:02:08.593]  But you can watch it at PrisonPlanet.com, where General Pace
[02:02:09.418 --> 02:02:11.679]  Says it's absolutely the responsibility of every U.S.
[02:02:11.739 --> 02:02:15.702]  service member if they see inhumane treatment being conducted to intervene and stop it.
[02:02:15.742 --> 02:02:16.222]  Rumsfeld!
[02:02:16.843 --> 02:02:19.384]  I don't think you mean they have an obligation to physically stop it.
[02:02:19.924 --> 02:02:20.525]  It's to report it.
[02:02:20.685 --> 02:02:21.205]  General Pace.
[02:02:21.866 --> 02:02:27.689]  If they are physically present when the inhumane treatment is taking place, sir, they have an obligation to try to stop it.
[02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:29.330]  Rumsfeld gets very upset.
[02:02:30.811 --> 02:02:32.992]  Scratching his head and looking all weird and pacing.
[02:02:34.453 --> 02:02:36.795]  There's an absolute... You want to talk about demons?
[02:02:36.815 --> 02:02:38.756]  That guy's got half the demons in him right now.
[02:02:41.678 --> 02:02:46.001]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:46.201 --> 02:02:50.545]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:53.336 --> 02:02:53.916]  We're good.
[02:03:14.534 --> 02:03:22.436]  Vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.656 --> 02:03:28.038]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:47.293 --> 02:03:51.455]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:51.875 --> 02:03:52.716]  So what do you do?
[02:03:53.016 --> 02:03:57.619]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:58.099 --> 02:04:00.200]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:01.561]  Sheltering in place.

[02:04:46.295 --> 02:04:48.997]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:49.457 --> 02:04:52.099]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:52.539 --> 02:04:58.984]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:32.553 --> 02:05:33.614]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:05:34.174 --> 02:05:35.354]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[02:05:35.794 --> 02:05:39.515]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:05:39.535 --> 02:05:43.836]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:44.376 --> 02:05:47.157]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.239 --> 02:05:57.160]  We can't let the Saddamists have control again.
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:00.423]  We can't let his people run the country.
[02:06:13.406 --> 02:06:30.210]  Our government, again the criminals that run it and have hijacked it, went over there and openly, they talked about numbers of 90 plus percent of the Saddam bureaucracy and regime and the Baathists, that's Saddam's party, being put into positions of control.
[02:06:32.009 --> 02:06:36.633]  And a lot of Iraqis that were going along with the takeover then started freaking out and fighting back.
[02:06:37.174 --> 02:06:45.761]  But there isn't one Iraqi that's fighting because he doesn't like being occupied or doesn't like seeing DU being used or doesn't like his relatives being kidnapped and hauled off to be tortured.
[02:06:46.402 --> 02:06:54.649]  And dead bodies being thrown out every day in front of people's doorsteps with electrical burns all over them and cigarette burns and teeth gouged out and organs cut out.
[02:06:54.749 --> 02:06:55.750]  Oh yeah, that's mainstream news.
[02:06:57.558 --> 02:06:57.939]  No, no, no.
[02:06:58.119 --> 02:07:00.160]  All of them are al-Zaqqari.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:01.541]  They're just all him.
[02:07:01.621 --> 02:07:03.062]  It's all al-Qaeda.
[02:07:03.643 --> 02:07:05.244]  Anyone who doesn't like it is al-Qaeda.
[02:07:05.985 --> 02:07:10.668]  And you can be assured, if they bring in foreign troops to America after some bio-attack, it's a total takeover.
[02:07:10.688 --> 02:07:12.130]  They're taking your land, taking your kids.
[02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:13.390]  You fight back, it'll be on the news.
[02:07:13.651 --> 02:07:15.232]  A local al-Qaeda man was killed today.
[02:07:16.053 --> 02:07:17.514]  Local al-Qaeda struck today.
[02:07:18.094 --> 02:07:20.176]  Al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda.
[02:07:20.436 --> 02:07:21.977]  Al-Qaeda did it, al-Qaeda did it, al-Qaeda did it.
[02:07:22.137 --> 02:07:22.778]  It was al-Qaeda.
[02:07:23.598 --> 02:07:25.500]  Alright, I'm... I'm ranting.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:29.161]  So that clip's coming up, and of course your calls.
[02:07:29.281 --> 02:07:33.443]  We're going to get to Jim and Dave and Mike and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:07:34.704 --> 02:07:35.644]  The time just flies.
[02:07:35.664 --> 02:07:37.425]  We're into the third hour, nine minutes.
[02:07:38.085 --> 02:07:41.246]  Well now, ten minutes exactly into this third hour.
[02:07:42.047 --> 02:07:44.368]  Deadly bacteria spreading through U.S.
[02:07:44.408 --> 02:07:44.888]  hospitals.
[02:07:44.948 --> 02:07:51.151]  Again, this is the kind of thing that I'm actually worried about.
[02:07:52.967 --> 02:07:54.568]  Not hearing much about the bird flu now.
[02:07:54.648 --> 02:07:59.311]  Oh, the Chinese are saying it may have mutated where it might be person to person, but we're not hearing too much.
[02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:07.336]  Every year there's going to be some deadly flu that's going to kill us, but the last five years, the supposed flu shot that we all go out and take to be safe.
[02:08:07.436 --> 02:08:09.577]  I know I don't, but you know, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:08:09.597 --> 02:08:10.418]  We all go out and take.
[02:08:11.999 --> 02:08:16.521]  They openly know before they even release it doesn't even cover the flu of the year, but same thing this year.
[02:08:16.882 --> 02:08:17.502]  Doesn't cover it.
[02:08:19.554 --> 02:08:20.795]  Doesn't cover the bird flu?
[02:08:20.976 --> 02:08:23.318]  Doesn't matter, you're lining up at record levels to get it.
[02:08:23.578 --> 02:08:24.399]  Actually, that's not true.
[02:08:24.439 --> 02:08:30.845]  Last year it was at all-time lows in the last decade, but this year they're setting a heavy record because they've upped the ante in the fair mongering.
[02:08:31.306 --> 02:08:33.648]  There's something they want you to take in that shot.
[02:08:35.570 --> 02:08:37.752]  Meanwhile, we've got real threats like this one.
[02:08:38.393 --> 02:08:40.735]  Deadly bacteria spreading through U.S.
[02:08:40.795 --> 02:08:41.376]  hospitals.
[02:08:43.550 --> 02:08:54.175]  And I personally know, one, two, three, three people this year who were doing pretty well but went and had a minor surgery and died of staph infections.
[02:08:54.295 --> 02:09:08.342]  Died of this superbacteria because for 55 years they've been giving greater and greater dosages and in different combo dosages, doses of antibiotics and the bacteria.
[02:09:08.402 --> 02:09:09.883]  We have bred superbacteria.
[02:09:11.448 --> 02:09:18.874]  And they give it for basically, when you go to the doctor, they still try to give it to you, and they don't even check to see if it's viral, they just, oh here's some antibiotics, and of course it screws you up.
[02:09:19.875 --> 02:09:28.262]  A lethal bacteria which surfaces in people being treated with antibiotics, oh really, is spreading in North America and has grown resistant to drugs.
[02:09:28.342 --> 02:09:29.003]  You mean immune.
[02:09:29.583 --> 02:09:32.426]  According to two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[02:09:33.366 --> 02:09:37.650]  I'm sure the government will save us by putting men in black uniforms on the streets, that's the cure for everything.
[02:09:38.433 --> 02:09:42.474]  In fact, if it cures everything, if you have cancer, they'll just have somebody in a black uniform stand over you.
[02:09:43.414 --> 02:09:44.175]  That'll heal you.
[02:09:44.395 --> 02:09:45.415]  It's just a cure for everything.
[02:09:46.135 --> 02:09:47.876]  I guess you'd call them a grim reaper in a way.
[02:09:48.176 --> 02:09:59.019]  According to one of the studies, a new virulent and resistant strain of bacteria, Colostrum deficil, broke out in eight U.S.
[02:09:59.059 --> 02:09:59.879]  hospital centers.
[02:10:01.698 --> 02:10:02.438]  We're good to go.
[02:10:19.043 --> 02:10:25.488]  A severe inflammation of the intestine has begun showing up in patients not taking antibiotics or visiting hospitals.
[02:10:25.508 --> 02:10:30.171]  Ah, wonderful gut-eating, flesh-eating bacteria in the lower intestine.
[02:10:30.391 --> 02:10:31.932]  Mmm, goody, goody gumdrop.
[02:10:32.853 --> 02:10:38.357]  Symptoms include watery and malodorous diarrhea and cramps.
[02:10:39.818 --> 02:10:46.122]  Another study of 1,703 patients, and most of this is underreported, in 12 hospitals in Quebec, Canada demonstrated the
[02:10:48.277 --> 02:10:50.117]  How lethal the bacteria is.
[02:10:51.518 --> 02:11:04.841]  And it says just in those hospitals, in 2004 it caused the deaths, just in Quebec, that they know of, of 117 people in the first month after they were diagnosed, all of the victims were elderly.
[02:11:05.341 --> 02:11:09.962]  So this thing has got a morbidity rate of the elderly very high.
[02:11:09.982 --> 02:11:14.743]  It's a lot more in one little state of Canada than the bird flu has.
[02:11:16.494 --> 02:11:20.837]  And this is just one of the loving little bacterias running around enjoying themselves.
[02:11:21.817 --> 02:11:32.063]  Tuberculosis, again folks, you can type in record, just type in record cases of tuberculosis Austin, Texas.
[02:11:32.103 --> 02:11:36.566]  Just type it into Google and you'll get the city health department, you'll get state documents.
[02:11:37.226 --> 02:11:39.167]  You will not find it in local papers.
[02:11:39.267 --> 02:11:40.308]  It's just a big secret.
[02:11:40.688 --> 02:11:42.469]  People are dying every day.
[02:11:42.809 --> 02:11:43.410]  Every day!
[02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:44.851]  Every day!
[02:11:44.911 --> 02:11:45.571]  You understand that?
[02:11:47.392 --> 02:11:50.014]  They already have modern sanitariums set up.
[02:11:50.815 --> 02:11:57.761]  We have a leprosy colony holding thousands in East Texas from our wonderfully legal alien friends.
[02:11:59.002 --> 02:12:01.624]  They are in the schools with drug immune TB.
[02:12:03.766 --> 02:12:07.289]  And they will infect in a year an average of 45 people.
[02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:10.632]  Now, that's each person.
[02:12:11.192 --> 02:12:14.615]  They in tune, but you notice you hear nothing about it.
[02:12:16.414 --> 02:12:17.234]  I talk a lot about this.
[02:12:17.274 --> 02:12:19.335]  See, they tell you what to worry about.
[02:12:22.595 --> 02:12:24.335]  Oh, I saw the latest numbers last week.
[02:12:24.416 --> 02:12:40.218]  Do they know that Los Zetas attributed killings of police officers, state, federal, and local, in Texas, so far in the last 11 months of this year, is 18 in Texas?
[02:12:40.238 --> 02:12:40.218]  18!
[02:12:40.879 --> 02:12:43.219]  Number one cause of deaths
[02:12:44.799 --> 02:12:49.161]  In Texas, is one Mexican military gang.
[02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:55.523]  You ask the average cop that, they're afraid of you and your wife when they pull you over.
[02:12:55.923 --> 02:12:58.264]  Because they're stupid.
[02:12:58.284 --> 02:13:00.045]  I'm stupid too.
[02:13:00.545 --> 02:13:01.265]  We're all dumb.
[02:13:01.305 --> 02:13:02.645]  We gotta get smart, folks.
[02:13:03.326 --> 02:13:04.606]  Time to get smart.
[02:13:05.286 --> 02:13:06.347]  Figure out the con.
[02:13:06.667 --> 02:13:09.828]  I have no respect for you getting conned and conned and conned.
[02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:12.229]  Eighteen dead cops.
[02:13:13.337 --> 02:13:25.045]  We are now over 800 dead, period, on our side and the Mexican side, just in the Texas border zone.
[02:13:25.065 --> 02:13:28.387]  500 and something were on their side, 300 and something on our side.
[02:13:28.508 --> 02:13:29.688]  It is insane.
[02:13:29.728 --> 02:13:32.550]  We're talking about Iraq levels of deaths.
[02:13:35.052 --> 02:13:40.416]  Missile attacks, rocket attacks, let me rephrase that, bazooka attacks,
[02:13:42.056 --> 02:13:44.118]  Laws, rocket attacks, and RPG attacks.
[02:13:44.158 --> 02:13:44.338]  There.
[02:13:45.099 --> 02:13:47.422]  Missile has a connotation that's improper.
[02:13:47.462 --> 02:13:48.543]  It's not a large weapon.
[02:13:49.224 --> 02:13:49.904]  This being is.
[02:13:51.005 --> 02:13:51.226]  U.S.
[02:13:51.306 --> 02:13:52.447]  embassies shut down.
[02:13:52.587 --> 02:13:52.807]  U.S.
[02:13:52.847 --> 02:13:53.748]  missions shut down.
[02:13:54.269 --> 02:13:55.110]  Huge cities.
[02:13:55.410 --> 02:13:58.113]  I said last week Laredo had 100,000.
[02:13:58.153 --> 02:13:58.413]  I don't know.
[02:13:58.433 --> 02:13:58.994]  It's 230-something thousand.
[02:13:59.014 --> 02:13:59.775]  I looked it up.
[02:14:02.879 --> 02:14:03.359]  Shut down.
[02:14:03.439 --> 02:14:06.760]  I mean, just people moving out, no tourism, totally dying.
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:08.201]  It was a thriving area.
[02:14:09.081 --> 02:14:10.382]  The cops just don't know about it.
[02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:12.142]  I've talked to Austin cops.
[02:14:12.162 --> 02:14:13.023]  They say, oh, what?
[02:14:13.543 --> 02:14:15.103]  I heard a little something about that.
[02:14:15.503 --> 02:14:17.684]  They don't have you in all your briefings warning you.
[02:14:18.705 --> 02:14:20.385]  They don't have you telling you about this.
[02:14:20.405 --> 02:14:21.686]  Your captains aren't telling you.
[02:14:21.906 --> 02:14:22.806]  What's their problem?
[02:14:23.166 --> 02:14:28.648]  Well, it wasn't on the news and Chief Nee and the San Antonio Chief and the Dallas Chief didn't decide to warn you.
[02:14:29.972 --> 02:14:36.057]  And I guess this is kind of old news, because actually in the last few months they have issued a few warnings now, so I'm incorrect.
[02:14:36.618 --> 02:14:40.561]  They've issued some tertiary warnings, but it should be detailed.
[02:14:43.143 --> 02:14:46.286]  So, what got me off on this?
[02:14:46.386 --> 02:14:47.647]  Oh, the whole flu thing.
[02:14:47.687 --> 02:14:52.872]  Let's worry about the flu, but let's not worry about flesh-eating bacteria showing up everywhere.
[02:14:57.068 --> 02:15:00.671]  You know, let's not stop the over-prescribing of antibiotics.
[02:15:00.691 --> 02:15:02.573]  You know, my dad's a dentist and oral surgeon.
[02:15:02.593 --> 02:15:04.875]  He has a lot of friends that are medical doctors, and they all agree.
[02:15:04.895 --> 02:15:07.537]  I remember hearing when I was a little kid, I'm like, I'm sick.
[02:15:08.338 --> 02:15:11.741]  And families were like, oh, go give him antibiotics, David, take him to the doctor.
[02:15:11.761 --> 02:15:16.345]  Well, I'll take him to the doctor, but I don't want him on antibiotics, because I used to get sick like once every two, three years.
[02:15:16.385 --> 02:15:21.930]  I was super healthy when all the other kids were always sick, because my dad said, you only take antibiotics if you step on a nail, or if you've
[02:15:22.569 --> 02:15:28.173]  Broken a leg and had major surgery, or if you've got pus coming out of you, you need antibiotics.
[02:15:28.193 --> 02:15:32.136]  You don't just take them because you might get an infection.
[02:15:32.176 --> 02:15:33.557]  You take them when it's life and death.
[02:15:33.798 --> 02:15:36.239]  And if we'd have used them for that, they'd still be a great tool.
[02:15:36.259 --> 02:15:38.901]  But no, they gave them to everybody.
[02:15:39.922 --> 02:15:42.764]  And still, the doctors know this, but they still give them to you.
[02:15:44.065 --> 02:15:46.447]  And I know people who are on antibiotics all the time.
[02:15:46.467 --> 02:15:47.488]  They're totally unhealthy.
[02:15:49.168 --> 02:15:52.290]  They got rashes all over their bodies, they go in to have surgery, they die!
[02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:54.111]  I got friends going to have surgery!
[02:15:55.772 --> 02:16:10.660]  Oh, I'm going in to have hernia surgery, and you go into that dirty hospital, with super bacteria that live on anything and everything, bred over millions of divisions, and uh, you're dead!
[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:11.260]  You die!
[02:16:14.002 --> 02:16:16.083]  And I'm not saying sometimes you don't need surgery!
[02:16:16.383 --> 02:16:17.604]  It's just look what they've done now!
[02:16:20.072 --> 02:16:21.233]  Look what they've done now.
[02:16:21.533 --> 02:16:22.614]  We were all in danger.
[02:16:22.654 --> 02:16:24.135]  You go to have a baby at the hospital.
[02:16:24.175 --> 02:16:30.719]  You go into the hospital to get a scope put in you to check for whatever.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.562]  And you go in there and there's flesh-eating bacteria on it.
[02:16:38.024 --> 02:16:38.865]  And it's over, folks.
[02:16:38.945 --> 02:16:39.685]  It's over for you.
[02:16:41.046 --> 02:16:41.466]  It's over.
[02:16:43.968 --> 02:16:45.429]  And I've just covered one more article.
[02:16:46.181 --> 02:16:49.004]  Tamiflu, useless against avian flu.
[02:16:49.024 --> 02:16:50.005]  We told you this months ago.
[02:16:50.045 --> 02:16:51.266]  We have medical doctors on.
[02:16:52.447 --> 02:16:56.731]  It's well known and it causes psychotic breaks, causes people to die.
[02:16:57.211 --> 02:17:02.957]  Doctors who had treated 41 victims of the virus say we place no importance on this drug.
[02:17:03.951 --> 02:17:04.651]  We're on that daily.
[02:17:05.212 --> 02:17:16.498]  After hitting 41 victims of H5N1, the deadly form of the bird flu virus, a Vietnamese doctor has concluded Tamiflu, the drug most widely stockpiled around the world to combat a feared pandemic, is useless.
[02:17:17.678 --> 02:17:17.758]  Ha!
[02:17:17.778 --> 02:17:21.721]  Doesn't matter, he had all these shareholders, open shareholders on TV saying, you better get it.
[02:17:22.241 --> 02:17:23.642]  See, they should all be arrested for that.
[02:17:24.082 --> 02:17:27.544]  Rumsfeld and others in the administration, it's just sick!
[02:17:28.544 --> 02:17:29.845]  Open criminal behavior.
[02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:32.263]  Well, you're just without a cut, Alex.

[02:19:43.465 --> 02:19:44.525]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:44.926 --> 02:19:50.408]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:50.988 --> 02:19:51.468]  That's right.
[02:19:51.788 --> 02:19:54.089]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:54.629 --> 02:20:01.552]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:02.122 --> 02:20:09.826]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:10.246 --> 02:20:15.108]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:15.748 --> 02:20:18.750]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:21.551 --> 02:20:25.674]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[02:20:33.518 --> 02:20:38.461]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:41.463 --> 02:20:48.387]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:20:49.645 --> 02:20:53.727]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:20:54.448 --> 02:21:01.491]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain and Western Europe.
[02:21:02.372 --> 02:21:11.136]  You need to know as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:16.879]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:57.877 --> 02:21:58.798]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:21:58.898 --> 02:22:04.461]  I want to get your points out, your questions out and move the next person so we can get to everybody because I'm a long-winded creature.
[02:22:05.342 --> 02:22:07.543]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Michigan.
[02:22:07.563 --> 02:22:08.204]  Jim, welcome.
[02:22:08.564 --> 02:22:09.404]  God bless you.
[02:22:09.604 --> 02:22:15.888]  I've got 10,000 of your Citizen's Rule books out, several thousand of your tapes out, millions of copies.
[02:22:16.028 --> 02:22:19.451]  I'm sorry to hear you change your frequency in the evening because I have 3210 on them.
[02:22:20.976 --> 02:22:23.479]  Well, I think we're going to try to switch back to that.
[02:22:23.499 --> 02:22:24.820]  I've got to call WWCR.
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.041]  I forgot to last Friday.
[02:22:26.722 --> 02:22:27.042]  You know what?
[02:22:27.062 --> 02:22:28.243]  You haven't called in about a year.
[02:22:28.263 --> 02:22:30.065]  You're the founder of Domino's Pizza.
[02:22:30.786 --> 02:22:34.429]  I've been working as hard as you guys to fight this new world order.
[02:22:34.729 --> 02:22:35.750]  Boy, you really have.
[02:22:36.191 --> 02:22:37.132]  But you haven't called in a while.
[02:22:37.152 --> 02:22:37.752]  Good to hear from you.
[02:22:38.073 --> 02:22:38.253]  Yeah.
[02:22:38.553 --> 02:22:41.997]  Hey, I'm sitting right here looking at a Kroger's apple juice bottle.
[02:22:42.017 --> 02:22:43.918]  It says, concentrate from China.
[02:22:44.519 --> 02:22:45.360]  And on another one,
[02:22:46.216 --> 02:22:47.537]  I don't know who makes it.
[02:22:48.958 --> 02:22:50.439]  Our family is the name of the thing.
[02:22:50.759 --> 02:22:53.641]  And that one says concentrate from China, New Zealand.
[02:22:54.141 --> 02:22:56.322]  How easy would it be for them to poison us?
[02:22:56.882 --> 02:22:57.743]  Well they already are.
[02:22:58.643 --> 02:23:04.407]  Remember in 96, the big scandal when it got hushed up, where just tons of raspberries
[02:23:05.548 --> 02:23:16.295]  And strawberries from Mexico had hepatitis C all over it because they sprayed infected human feces on it as a fertilizer and a bunch of kids got it.
[02:23:16.776 --> 02:23:27.624]  And so then the answer was force all the kids to be vaccinated so we can keep feeding them stuff covered in... I mean, folks, you can't use that here in the U.S., but they do in Mexico.
[02:23:28.436 --> 02:23:35.580]  Well, some of these judges, you know, are starting to figure out, and some of the cops, that when the Constitution's gone, their retirement's gone, too.
[02:23:36.261 --> 02:23:39.042]  Some of them are starting to figure it out, Alex.
[02:23:39.142 --> 02:23:39.703]  Oh, really?
[02:23:39.743 --> 02:23:40.783]  What are they saying to you?
[02:23:41.063 --> 02:23:46.327]  Well, we got one guy off at 95 years facing 95 years in prison.
[02:23:46.727 --> 02:23:47.948]  The judge figured it out.
[02:23:48.008 --> 02:23:53.651]  I handed her a copy of Bogreit's election brochure where he tells about that he was going to reinstate the Kennedy money.
[02:23:54.358 --> 02:24:06.765]  And I showed her a whole thing on the Kennedy Money and the next day when she let the guy go, she says, Sir, it has been my great... Oh, she said it so beautifully.
[02:24:11.948 --> 02:24:14.569]  It also helps that you're prominent, you and your brother up in that area.
[02:24:14.829 --> 02:24:18.031]  Oh, we stuck our necks out on this one, but we got a major guy out.
[02:24:18.604 --> 02:24:19.685]  And we woke up the judge.
[02:24:20.206 --> 02:24:22.187]  I sent a newspaper article about that.
[02:24:22.227 --> 02:24:23.549]  That was a good thing you guys did.
[02:24:23.869 --> 02:24:26.091]  She was talking Constitution in the court.
[02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:27.052]  Can you believe that?
[02:24:27.112 --> 02:24:29.795]  Well, I'm telling you, we got a chance to turn the tide.
[02:24:30.055 --> 02:24:34.799]  Look, we're telling the cops and the judges and all of you, choose sides.
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:35.860]  Choose.
[02:24:36.121 --> 02:24:38.763]  Are you with us, the people, or are you with these scallywags?
[02:24:38.983 --> 02:24:43.788]  We can win, we must win, and we will win, but people gotta get off their dead butts.
[02:24:45.487 --> 02:24:49.350]  Well, God's going to help us, and people like you out there, you just keep it going, brother.
[02:24:49.390 --> 02:24:49.891]  God bless you.
[02:24:49.911 --> 02:24:52.513]  I got billions of pieces out with your websites on it.
[02:24:52.593 --> 02:24:56.437]  That's why I hate it when you change the frequency, and I'm having trouble picking up the new ones.
[02:24:56.837 --> 02:24:57.297]  You know what?
[02:24:57.357 --> 02:24:59.679]  I've heard that from... I'm not going to exaggerate.
[02:24:59.719 --> 02:25:01.221]  Probably 500 phone calls.
[02:25:01.281 --> 02:25:02.562]  You guys are going to get what you want.
[02:25:02.582 --> 02:25:06.565]  We'll switch the... In fact, just... I'll call them at the end of the show.
[02:25:06.625 --> 02:25:08.387]  Tell them I want to go back to 3210 or something else.
[02:25:08.447 --> 02:25:09.408]  It's just driving me wild.
[02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.929]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:10.989 --> 02:25:11.670]  Good to hear from you.
[02:25:11.710 --> 02:25:12.270]  God bless you.
[02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.871]  That's Jim.
[02:25:13.684 --> 02:25:15.445]  And Jim, I've got a lot of info from him.
[02:25:15.485 --> 02:25:17.466]  He's been in the paper a lot of times, the work he's done.
[02:25:17.826 --> 02:25:19.847]  That is the founder of Domino's Pizza.
[02:25:20.428 --> 02:25:24.090]  And now you can read about him going around and giving all his money away and helping everybody.
[02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.830]  He's easy to talk about.
[02:25:26.211 --> 02:25:26.751]  Incredible.
[02:25:26.871 --> 02:25:28.492]  He's totally anti-New World Order, folks.
[02:25:29.272 --> 02:25:31.013]  Let's talk to Dan in Washington.
[02:25:31.053 --> 02:25:31.874]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:25:31.914 --> 02:25:32.354]  Go ahead.
[02:25:32.374 --> 02:25:33.134]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:33.775 --> 02:25:33.875]  Hi.
[02:25:34.055 --> 02:25:36.176]  I just wanted to bring up a quick comment and I'll let you go.
[02:25:36.836 --> 02:25:40.378]  November 29th, the NASDAQ closed down 6.66 points.
[02:25:43.846 --> 02:25:46.548]  Well, that could be a coincidence, or it could be a globalist omen.
[02:25:47.568 --> 02:25:49.069]  Yeah, just thought it was kind of odd.
[02:25:49.109 --> 02:26:00.935]  I know they're always into that weird numerology and giving numbers and hints and things, and it did coincide with the end of the month was the new moon, which it landed on, so I just thought it was a coincidence, wanted to get your comment.
[02:26:02.316 --> 02:26:06.879]  They're obsessed with the gods, the same old Roman gods.
[02:26:08.799 --> 02:26:11.381]  I heard somebody talk about this this weekend on the radio, but it's true.
[02:26:11.401 --> 02:26:29.335]  If you read in, I believe it's Revelations, but I'm not the scholar, it talks about Apothicos, and then that's in the Greek, that's Apollo, and that's who they really worship, and it's all this numerology, and they make every decision they make according to numerology, and it's just crazy.
[02:26:30.015 --> 02:26:32.797]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:26:32.857 --> 02:26:35.399]  And people tuning in going, wait a minute, you believe in numerology?
[02:26:35.599 --> 02:26:35.920]  No!
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:37.661]  I'm saying the elite do.
[02:26:38.491 --> 02:26:51.068]  And to boil it down even further, you know, Nancy Reagan, Reagan, every decision he made, everything he did, to the minute he gave a speech was according to, you know, where the planets were, what they were doing.
[02:26:51.248 --> 02:26:52.170]  They believe it.
[02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:53.231]  We don't believe it.
[02:26:53.591 --> 02:26:54.653]  They're obsessed with it.
[02:26:56.371 --> 02:27:00.454]  You know, nowadays, to even talk about this means you believe in it, and that's not what we're saying.
[02:27:00.754 --> 02:27:01.315]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:27:01.715 --> 02:27:02.796]  No, that's all I had to say.
[02:27:02.816 --> 02:27:04.137]  Just wanted to get some comments on it.
[02:27:04.157 --> 02:27:04.657]  Love the show.
[02:27:04.978 --> 02:27:05.318]  Thank you.
[02:27:05.398 --> 02:27:22.331]  I didn't see that, but I mean, there's blaring stuff like, on the one-year anniversary, the Chicago Mercantile Commodities Exchange closes at 9-1-1-point-0-0-0-0-0, and the New York Lottery comes up 9-1-1 at the same time, and like five other things happen, too.
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:26.245]  I mean, that's just flaunting it, flaunting it in your face.
[02:27:26.645 --> 02:27:28.428]  They believe they draw power from that.
[02:27:31.833 --> 02:27:32.734]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.235 --> 02:27:34.837]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.759 --> 02:27:38.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.515 --> 02:27:48.879]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:49.099 --> 02:27:54.103]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:54.443 --> 02:28:02.348]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:02.488 --> 02:28:09.533]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:09.753 --> 02:28:10.955]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:11.115 --> 02:28:14.499]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:14.559 --> 02:28:15.680]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:15.981 --> 02:28:17.242]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:17.462 --> 02:28:24.291]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:24.411 --> 02:28:26.854]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:42.589 --> 02:28:45.593]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:45.933 --> 02:28:54.763]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:55.083 --> 02:28:59.769]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:00.209 --> 02:29:06.933]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:07.334 --> 02:29:19.121]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:19.601 --> 02:29:20.622]  Welcome to realityzone.com.
[02:29:20.682 --> 02:29:21.663]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:57.273]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[02:29:57.834 --> 02:30:00.376]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:30:01.257 --> 02:30:05.821]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:30:06.434 --> 02:30:11.137]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:30:11.677 --> 02:30:30.308]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:30:30.868 --> 02:30:35.591]  That's www.LibertyDollar.org or call toll-free
[02:30:36.118 --> 02:30:36.198]  888-421-6181.
[02:30:36.218 --> 02:30:50.931]  Mike, Steve, Adam and others, we're going to get to your calls here in a few minutes.
[02:30:50.971 --> 02:30:55.115]  Let me get into some more news now.
[02:31:02.546 --> 02:31:06.209]  I meant to cover this Friday, and I just never got around to it, but here it is.
[02:31:06.549 --> 02:31:09.932]  Fossil fuel theory takes hit with NASA finding.
[02:31:11.334 --> 02:31:12.014]  WorldNet Daily.
[02:31:12.054 --> 02:31:15.757]  New study shows methane on Saturn's moon Titan not biological.
[02:31:16.278 --> 02:31:25.185]  NASA scientists are about to publish conclusive studies showing abundant methane of a non-biological nature is found on Saturn's giant moon Titan.
[02:31:25.205 --> 02:31:27.387]  You know, isn't Titan almost as big as the Earth?
[02:31:27.407 --> 02:31:27.948]  It's just huge.
[02:31:28.687 --> 02:31:34.670]  A finding that validates a new book's contention that oil is not a fossil fuel.
[02:31:34.770 --> 02:31:36.671]  And then it goes into an ad for Walnut Daily.
[02:31:37.992 --> 02:31:40.373]  The point is, it isn't a contention.
[02:31:40.433 --> 02:31:43.535]  With any of these arguments, it's both.
[02:31:45.256 --> 02:31:47.737]  There is most assuredly fossil coal.
[02:31:47.797 --> 02:31:53.540]  They've dug up whole fields of coal that have got imprints of ferns and everything else in them.
[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:54.581]  Animals, bugs.
[02:31:56.653 --> 02:32:01.414]  That does form coal, it does form shale oil, it does, it does!
[02:32:02.214 --> 02:32:10.376]  But most oil they find has nothing biological in it, no record of anything biological in it, that stuff just doesn't break down!
[02:32:10.996 --> 02:32:14.656]  You're going to find skeletal remains of even plankton!
[02:32:16.117 --> 02:32:20.618]  You're going to find skeletal remains from plants and microscopic animals!
[02:32:21.298 --> 02:32:22.718]  It's just, it's poppycock!
[02:32:24.182 --> 02:32:26.484]  And the evidence is just ridiculous.
[02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:34.348]  And how many oil fields do they find where they found that all the oil disappears and then all of a sudden it just gushes back up a year later?
[02:32:34.369 --> 02:32:35.829]  And then they test it.
[02:32:37.530 --> 02:32:42.954]  We've written giant articles about it full of just hundreds of links and we openly have the Bilderberg Group.
[02:32:44.091 --> 02:32:51.357]  Putting out reports along with the Club of Rome in the 70s and the 80s saying they're going to create a peak oil fraud.
[02:32:51.797 --> 02:32:56.681]  And all these little peak oil sites go, show us the proof, show us the proof, and then won't link to the proof.
[02:32:57.201 --> 02:32:57.982]  That's another tactic.
[02:32:58.222 --> 02:33:00.524]  Why, there's no proof, and then just don't show the proof.
[02:33:00.604 --> 02:33:02.065]  And oh, we'll see, they won't respond.
[02:33:03.386 --> 02:33:12.914]  I've actually had sites and newspapers and, you know, runs the gamut from local stuff to national stuff go, Alex Jones, you prove these claims, and then we respond, and they never publish our response.
[02:33:13.576 --> 02:33:15.497]  So I learned a long time ago just to not respond to them.
[02:33:17.198 --> 02:33:22.381]  The studies announced by NASA yesterday will be reported in the December 8th issue of the scientific journal Nature.
[02:33:23.122 --> 02:33:27.664]  This finding confirms one of the key arguments in Black Gold Stranglehold.
[02:33:28.125 --> 02:33:30.366]  The myth of scarcity of politics of oil.
[02:33:30.386 --> 02:33:31.707]  That's true.
[02:33:33.228 --> 02:33:36.990]  Jerome Corsi is right about that, but he's also just a frothing pro-war guy.
[02:33:37.862 --> 02:33:47.587]  Nyman concludes that the methane must be replenished by geological processes on Titan, perhaps venting from a supply in the interior that could have been trapped there as the moon formed.
[02:33:48.727 --> 02:33:59.032]  Methane has been systematically created in the laboratory, has been reported by top scientists, and now NASA confirms that abiotic methane is abundantly found on Titan.
[02:33:59.052 --> 02:34:02.474]  It's unlimited, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:02.514 --> 02:34:06.196]  The realization that hydrocarbons are produced
[02:34:08.268 --> 02:34:09.088]  What more do we have to do?
[02:34:09.128 --> 02:34:10.269]  What more do we have to prove?
[02:34:10.289 --> 02:34:11.749]  I mean, if oil is really fossil
[02:34:32.831 --> 02:34:37.515]  Then you're going to find evidence of it being fossil from living creatures all throughout it.
[02:34:37.895 --> 02:34:40.677]  And you only find that in rare, select stratus.
[02:34:41.838 --> 02:34:43.199]  What does this conclusively prove?
[02:34:43.239 --> 02:34:44.200]  That there is both.
[02:34:45.641 --> 02:34:52.166]  But now to keep the false debate going, the globalists are craftily having their minions come out and claim, oh no, there's no fossil fuel!
[02:34:52.206 --> 02:34:55.249]  See, creating debates where there is none.
[02:34:56.409 --> 02:35:00.733]  Yes, fossil fuels are renewable, but over a time frame that we just
[02:35:01.385 --> 02:35:03.026]  For all intents and purposes are not renewable.
[02:35:03.406 --> 02:35:05.508]  So for all intents and purposes it is not a renewable resource.
[02:35:06.528 --> 02:35:12.752]  But these abiotic or non-biological forms of fuel are almost unlimited.
[02:35:14.993 --> 02:35:22.338]  And then you hear the story about how the climate's changing because we're using too many fossil fuels and so we've got to stop using them or have a global tax.
[02:35:23.759 --> 02:35:26.140]  Well what's a global tax going to do to save the environment?
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:26.500]  Nothing!
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:29.102]  It's just, oh we've got global warming so we need a global tax!
[02:35:30.801 --> 02:35:32.848]  Even if we believe global warming is real, what does that do?
[02:35:34.412 --> 02:35:36.674]  And then you realize the Earth is constantly changing.
[02:35:36.954 --> 02:35:40.157]  The Earth is not stagnant for 20 million years, like they say.
[02:35:40.577 --> 02:35:46.562]  Now most even top, even secular scientists are saying, no, the evidence shows every few thousand it's violent.
[02:35:46.882 --> 02:35:55.029]  Well, so does the Egyptian, and the Grecian, and the Roman, and the Tunisian, and the African, and the Chinese, and the Japanese record.
[02:35:55.369 --> 02:36:03.776]  Constant tidal waves, constant tsunamis, constant earthquakes, constant collapses and mudslides, constant raising and lowering.
[02:36:04.276 --> 02:36:07.078]  I mean, there are whole Greek civilizations underwater they found.
[02:36:08.579 --> 02:36:13.482]  Pompeii, whole Roman cities, tens of thousands covered in two minutes.
[02:36:15.163 --> 02:36:20.066]  They didn't run around screaming, oh, fossil fuels, our cook fires did this.
[02:36:20.427 --> 02:36:22.468]  And they've done the mathematical calculations.
[02:36:23.108 --> 02:36:27.631]  A volcano, a major gas volcano or ash volcano venting.
[02:36:28.672 --> 02:36:31.474]  One major Mount St.
[02:36:31.514 --> 02:36:33.455]  Helens, which is small compared to a Krakatoa.
[02:36:34.634 --> 02:36:47.780]  Blowing up puts out many times greater amounts of climate-changing gases and dust than all fossil fuel usage in the last hundred years.
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:52.622]  Now that's just scientific ratios and facts.
[02:36:53.722 --> 02:36:58.944]  Whereas a volcano, like you see in the Hawaiian Islands, puts out a fraction of what we do.
[02:36:59.645 --> 02:37:00.265]  Because they're
[02:37:01.232 --> 02:37:07.176]  Predominantly a slow-flowing magma island producing type structures, non-explosive vents.
[02:37:08.217 --> 02:37:15.401]  I'm not a volcanologist, I just have read what the volcanologists have said, and then the calculations of the gas being injected and released from these.
[02:37:15.441 --> 02:37:18.623]  I mean, if we really think... Now let me stop there.
[02:37:20.525 --> 02:37:27.329]  Do you know what is really dangerous, and where I'm an environmentalist, and where I think there should be laws and people locked up,
[02:37:29.722 --> 02:37:31.123]  And that's genetic engineering.
[02:37:31.283 --> 02:37:32.724]  It is deadly dangerous.
[02:37:32.884 --> 02:37:33.764]  It is real.
[02:37:34.224 --> 02:37:36.185]  It could totally screw stuff up.
[02:37:36.786 --> 02:37:38.486]  It already is screwing things up.
[02:37:38.707 --> 02:37:40.568]  It could kill entire biospheres.
[02:37:40.968 --> 02:37:43.009]  It is damaging entire biospheres.
[02:37:43.449 --> 02:37:47.391]  They are just randomly cramming 4, 5, 6, 10 different animals into plants.
[02:37:48.163 --> 02:37:50.064]  Four, five, six different plants into animals.
[02:37:50.084 --> 02:37:57.407]  They're doing wild open releases of these engineered salmon, putting salmon in corn, bugs and everything you can imagine.
[02:37:58.267 --> 02:38:02.709]  And I've had the top biologists, the top scientists, I've had Nobel Prize winners on.
[02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:08.432]  I've had people at the top of their fields on who were pro-genetic engineering until they thought they were God.
[02:38:08.492 --> 02:38:11.893]  They thought mapping 4% of the human genome and then claiming they had 100%.
[02:38:11.933 --> 02:38:12.254]  That's not true.
[02:38:14.759 --> 02:38:15.920]  Because it's the combinations.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:16.780]  The randomness.
[02:38:17.181 --> 02:38:21.384]  It's the spiral.
[02:38:23.565 --> 02:38:24.446]  96% totally unmapped.
[02:38:24.486 --> 02:38:28.268]  Within that 96% there are tens of trillions of different combinations.
[02:38:28.288 --> 02:38:29.189]  So it's infinity.
[02:38:29.629 --> 02:38:30.790]  And it cannot be mapped.
[02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:32.912]  And yes, they can go in and change one thing.
[02:38:32.932 --> 02:38:35.373]  And they know it's going to change this one attribute.
[02:38:35.673 --> 02:38:38.796]  Or this one area of an animal.
[02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:39.896]  Or a plant.
[02:38:40.337 --> 02:38:43.659]  But it's then going to change randomly hundreds of other things.
[02:38:44.562 --> 02:38:45.663]  They don't know what it's going to do.
[02:38:46.263 --> 02:38:47.224]  Each time it's different.
[02:38:47.464 --> 02:38:54.069]  It's never the same in a potato, or in a pig, or in a whatever animal it is, in a bacteria.
[02:38:54.089 --> 02:38:55.470]  There's no control.
[02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:56.591]  Zero!
[02:38:57.371 --> 02:38:58.292]  And it's deadly!
[02:39:00.374 --> 02:39:03.616]  You hear absolutely nothing about it on the nightly news.
[02:39:03.736 --> 02:39:04.457]  No, you don't.
[02:39:05.597 --> 02:39:11.822]  When the big companies, when the patents ran out on Freon, they just had a big freak out, it's killing the ozone layer.
[02:39:12.774 --> 02:39:13.794]  And ran around and banned it?
[02:39:14.154 --> 02:39:15.154]  When it did absolutely nothing?
[02:39:16.195 --> 02:39:22.936]  Then they tell us there's too much ozone from our cars to have an ozone action day, but oh no, ozone on the ground that we put out is going to go up and destroy the ozone layer.
[02:39:23.156 --> 02:39:26.977]  When science shows it doesn't even get up into the atmosphere, it goes, it's low-lying.
[02:39:27.417 --> 02:39:32.838]  It's just all, but again, they stampede you into accepting it, a major feudal control system.
[02:39:34.658 --> 02:39:38.319]  So all you environmentalists listening, why don't you get involved in exposing genetic engineering?
[02:39:39.102 --> 02:39:42.326]  Why don't you get involved in exposing how dangerous inorganic food is?
[02:39:42.886 --> 02:39:54.680]  Why don't you get involved, and I know some of you are, but just stop trying to take the farmer and rancher's land to give to the Nature Conservancy so ten years later, when you've forgotten about it, they can sell it for a golf course.
[02:39:56.431 --> 02:40:01.535]  Why don't you stop being idiots and stop calling for the UN and world government to tax us?
[02:40:02.135 --> 02:40:04.517]  And why don't you get involved in real situations?
[02:40:04.577 --> 02:40:05.598]  Is the climate changing?
[02:40:05.638 --> 02:40:05.938]  Yes.
[02:40:06.318 --> 02:40:09.040]  Now they're saying the Gulf Stream is slowing and we're going to have an ice age.
[02:40:09.701 --> 02:40:13.243]  And folks, that's what the real scientists have been saying for 30 years.
[02:40:16.345 --> 02:40:19.267]  And of course, if we have a new ice age, other areas will get hotter.
[02:40:19.828 --> 02:40:21.009]  The Earth changes!
[02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:22.630]  It's a giant spaceship!
[02:40:25.168 --> 02:40:26.189]  What do you think it is?
[02:40:29.011 --> 02:40:31.692]  What is it, 24, 28,000 miles around this sucker?
[02:40:32.773 --> 02:40:33.294]  I forget.
[02:40:33.314 --> 02:40:42.200]  I mean, we're a gigantic planetoid circling a standard sun two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:48.944]  Right now, we are a giant structure, a giant lab experiment by the big boy upstairs, the big man.
[02:40:49.365 --> 02:40:51.666]  When the man comes to town, folks, you're all in trouble.
[02:40:52.227 --> 02:40:52.787]  I'm in trouble.
[02:40:54.975 --> 02:40:56.115]  That's all this is.
[02:40:56.896 --> 02:40:58.336]  We think too much of ourselves.
[02:40:59.896 --> 02:41:04.437]  And what you ought to worry about is changing the basic fabric of that, the balance of that.
[02:41:05.078 --> 02:41:09.639]  The Earth can handle getting hotter, getting colder, sea levels going up a few inches, even a few feet.
[02:41:10.239 --> 02:41:21.882]  What we cannot handle, what we cannot abide, is super bacteria and super viruses, and they're making them in labs, they're randomly creating them, it's a disaster.
[02:41:25.686 --> 02:41:26.906]  But out of sight, out of mind.
[02:41:26.987 --> 02:41:29.067]  They tell you not to worry about it, so you don't worry about it.
[02:41:29.087 --> 02:41:30.988]  They tell you what to worry about.
[02:41:31.028 --> 02:41:35.130]  They tell you what to get upset about.
[02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:36.910]  300 CIA flights landed in Europe.
[02:41:37.350 --> 02:41:39.411]  Over 300 flights operated by U.S.
[02:41:39.431 --> 02:41:43.173]  intelligence agency CIA and landed at European airports and U.K.
[02:41:43.213 --> 02:41:43.753]  daily rides.
[02:41:44.477 --> 02:41:50.041]  While the alleged existence of CIA jails on EU territory is set to dominate a European trip by U.S.
[02:41:50.061 --> 02:41:51.562]  Foreign Secretary Condoleezza Rice next week.
[02:41:51.902 --> 02:41:53.263]  This is all a big diversion.
[02:41:53.803 --> 02:42:07.552]  They had the CIA section chief three years ago, three and a half years ago, longer than that, right after 9-11, in the Washington Post, bragging, I'll put it in the Road to Tyranny, about how they fly people to foreign countries in Europe and the Middle East to torture them, and how they tortured their kids in front of them.
[02:42:08.432 --> 02:42:12.895]  It was in the, back when they thought they had some of their propaganda smell, the crooks talked.
[02:42:14.170 --> 02:42:19.954]  Now there's a debate about these former Soviet gulags, but everything's okay.
[02:42:19.994 --> 02:42:35.484]  Hillary's military offensive, Clinton's hawkish stance as a two-edged political sword, and it goes on about how she's a big military lady now, and she says Bush needs to do more to prosecute the war, and that Syria and Iran need to be dealt with.
[02:42:35.504 --> 02:42:36.225]  Same thing Kerry did.
[02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:43.954]  And she's wearing this mask, this fake little crazy smile, kind of like the Bush First Lady does.
[02:42:45.775 --> 02:42:48.036]  And it just makes me sick.
[02:42:48.076 --> 02:42:55.481]  And then Bush has all these other people talking about what a great job he's done, Lieberman, Lieberman and others.
[02:42:56.201 --> 02:43:03.446]  Meanwhile, the Senate is set to pass the forced inoculation, total liability protection for any vaccine.
[02:43:04.486 --> 02:43:07.408]  And it's open pork barrel to the vaccine makers,
[02:43:08.491 --> 02:43:12.615]  They're already trying to force 30 plus, what is it, like 36 vaccines on kids?
[02:43:12.955 --> 02:43:14.756]  There's no law, but they're trying to act like there is.
[02:43:15.177 --> 02:43:18.900]  Now they want to come out with dozens of new ones a year and force them on us.
[02:43:21.462 --> 02:43:23.183]  And then there's ridiculous stories like this.
[02:43:23.303 --> 02:43:26.206]  Al-Qaeda number three killed by CIA spy plane.
[02:43:26.826 --> 02:43:28.207]  I mean, how many times has that happened?
[02:43:28.507 --> 02:43:31.410]  There's another article about how the textbooks our government pays for it.
[02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:34.012]  They even admit in the article, well, in the Telegraph,
[02:43:34.719 --> 02:43:43.081]  That our government pays for these textbooks about what a great leader George Bush is and how he just stays the course and he should be worshipped?
[02:43:43.701 --> 02:43:50.083]  I mean, any time our government's paying for textbooks that say, Worship the President, whether it's here or overseas, we're in trouble, folks.
[02:43:52.183 --> 02:43:53.664]  Oh no, there's not propaganda.
[02:43:54.404 --> 02:43:56.024]  Besides, what do the propagandists think?
[02:43:56.084 --> 02:43:58.005]  No one's going to buy that when it's that overt.
[02:43:58.685 --> 02:44:00.125]  That's another problem the globalists have got.
[02:44:00.325 --> 02:44:02.086]  The propaganda's gotten so overt,
[02:44:02.708 --> 02:44:04.329]  You've really got to be... You know what?
[02:44:04.769 --> 02:44:07.130]  I said I'd play this clip, and if we're going to take calls, I'd better play it now.
[02:44:09.451 --> 02:44:13.252]  Fast forward that clip about a minute, because it's five minutes long, and we won't have time to play it in this segment if we don't.
[02:44:13.652 --> 02:44:21.756]  The reporter asks about torture, and then they go into how, well, we don't know who all is torturing, and we've got a bunch of countries there, and it's not our job to control it.
[02:44:22.256 --> 02:44:30.239]  And then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff corrects Rumsfeld and says, yes sir, you do, if you're physically present, you do have an obligation to try to stop it.
[02:44:32.559 --> 02:44:34.180]  So, did you fast forward that?
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:36.562]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:44:38.843 --> 02:44:45.068]  Inhumane behavior is obviously worrisome and harmful to them when that occurs.
[02:44:46.208 --> 02:44:51.252]  Iraq knows of certain knowledge that they need the support of the international community.
[02:44:52.172 --> 02:45:00.998]  And a good way to lose it is to make a practice of something that's inconsistent with the values of the international community.
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.482]  And I think they know that.
[02:45:03.622 --> 02:45:09.828]  Now, you know, I can't go any farther in talking about it.
[02:45:10.369 --> 02:45:21.220]  Obviously, the United States does not have a responsibility when a sovereign country engages in something that they disapprove of.
[02:45:21.501 --> 02:45:24.644]  However, we do have a responsibility to say so and to
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:34.803]  Make sure that the training is proper and to work with the sovereign officials so that they understand the damage that can be done to them in the event some of these allegations prove to be true.
[02:45:36.363 --> 02:45:44.085]  What guidance do you have for your military commanders over there as to what to do when General Horst found this interior ministry jail?
[02:45:44.225 --> 02:45:46.806]  It is absolutely the responsibility of every U.S.
[02:45:46.846 --> 02:45:53.768]  service member if they see inhumane treatment being conducted to intervene to stop it.
[02:45:54.918 --> 02:46:01.463]  As an example of how to do it if you don't see it happening, but you're told about it, is exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago.
[02:46:01.823 --> 02:46:05.086]  There's a report from an Iraqi to a U.S.
[02:46:05.146 --> 02:46:09.429]  commander that there was possibility of inhumane treatment in a particular facility.
[02:46:09.890 --> 02:46:10.350]  That U.S.
[02:46:10.390 --> 02:46:22.880]  commander got together with his Iraqi counterparts, they went together to the facility, found what they found, reported it to the Iraqi government, and the Iraqi government has taken ownership of that problem and is investigating it.
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:24.561]  So they did exactly what they should have done.
[02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:28.264]  I don't think you mean they have an obligation to physically stop it.
[02:46:28.364 --> 02:46:29.185]  It's to report it.
[02:46:30.546 --> 02:46:36.492]  If they are physically present when inhumane treatment is taking place or they have an obligation to try to stop it.
[02:46:37.825 --> 02:46:38.525]  Let me follow up.
[02:46:38.786 --> 02:46:53.413]  To what extent do you think these allegations of abuses by the Iraqi security forces, particularly some of the complaints and allegations from Sunni Iraqis... Again, I'm sorry about the quality of that.
[02:46:53.493 --> 02:46:57.555]  Rumsfeld kept hitting the microphone, bumping into it while he did it.
[02:46:58.436 --> 02:47:02.878]  And the footage comes from a pool camera that was just mic'd for the room, but again, that doesn't really matter.
[02:47:04.199 --> 02:47:05.519]  Kind of a tertiary issue.
[02:47:07.691 --> 02:47:10.312]  Now, the General himself is trying to whitewash the whole thing.
[02:47:10.432 --> 02:47:11.693]  Oh, it's other groups doing it.
[02:47:11.733 --> 02:47:12.473]  It's rogue groups.
[02:47:12.513 --> 02:47:13.854]  It's other foreign armies there.
[02:47:13.974 --> 02:47:14.894]  Oh, it's mercenaries.
[02:47:15.034 --> 02:47:22.757]  Oh, it's everybody but our own government, which is running the whole operation, with the former torture master, Negroponte, who went and set it all up.
[02:47:22.797 --> 02:47:27.579]  Now the head of domestic intelligence, like Heinrich Himmler, here in the United States.
[02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:31.501]  But at least on record, the General is like, well, if we're there, you know,
[02:47:32.583 --> 02:47:42.189]  That's like a cop saying, well, I have no responsibility to investigate murder and death and killing, but if I happen to be in the room while the serial killer is torturing a woman to death, well, then I do.
[02:47:42.229 --> 02:47:44.911]  And Rumsfeld's like, well, no, you really don't.
[02:47:44.931 --> 02:47:46.712]  And the General's like, well, yes, we really do.
[02:47:49.714 --> 02:47:59.501]  So, but if you go read the White House papers on this, what they told the military to do three years ago, it's we're above the law, we can torture whoever we want, we can do whatever we want,
[02:48:00.177 --> 02:48:11.566]  And then it's admitted the Taliban and others would just go round up goat herders who never even left their village, go sell them for $25,000 a piece to the mercs who'd come sell them for even more to our government, and they'd just take little goat herders.
[02:48:11.586 --> 02:48:12.347]  This is admitted.
[02:48:12.607 --> 02:48:16.550]  The CIA section chief who was over in Afghanistan went public with this.
[02:48:16.570 --> 02:48:19.312]  Because again, they're not all pure evil, folks.
[02:48:19.713 --> 02:48:27.939]  And said, yeah, we would actually pay for totally innocent people, families, and go torture the daylights out of them.
[02:48:27.959 --> 02:48:28.660]  I mean, that's the fact.
[02:48:30.003 --> 02:48:30.963]  This is sick, folks!
[02:48:31.083 --> 02:48:32.184]  I don't want that on my soul!
[02:48:32.804 --> 02:48:35.845]  These neocons get on the radio and go, ah, so what if some are innocent?
[02:48:36.045 --> 02:48:36.946]  Just torture!
[02:48:37.106 --> 02:48:37.666]  I like it!
[02:48:37.726 --> 02:48:38.787]  I like torture!
[02:48:38.987 --> 02:48:41.268]  Torture's good!
[02:48:42.948 --> 02:48:45.789]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:46.049 --> 02:48:47.630]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.970 --> 02:48:52.652]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:52.992 --> 02:48:59.715]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:00.055 --> 02:49:02.037]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:02.237 --> 02:49:05.079]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:09.844]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:10.044 --> 02:49:14.428]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:14.688 --> 02:49:21.914]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:51:27.848 --> 02:51:30.930]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:37.073]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:44.817 --> 02:51:45.337]  Don't worry.
[02:51:45.797 --> 02:51:47.318]  This show is documented.
[02:51:47.838 --> 02:51:50.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:53.664 --> 02:51:57.767]  I want to try to jam three final calls in here, if I can just give you each about 45 seconds.
[02:51:58.808 --> 02:52:01.310]  Mike and Steven Adams, sorry to all the others who don't have time.
[02:52:02.351 --> 02:52:05.554]  And I've got to cover this final news article, so we've got to move quickly here.
[02:52:05.634 --> 02:52:08.496]  Basically, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:09.017 --> 02:52:12.720]  Drugs Report, Jerusalem Post, sensationalized story about nuclear Iran.
[02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:18.725]  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei,
[02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:23.897]  I was asked by some of the British papers, hey, can they get a nuclear weapon?
[02:52:23.937 --> 02:52:31.598]  He said, well, if they had a fuel, you know, a whole fuel cell and had it all loaded up, yeah, they or any other country would be months away from possibly having a nuclear weapon.
[02:52:31.938 --> 02:52:40.380]  And then that was taken out of context and turned into they're months away from a nuclear weapon when he said, no, we don't have evidence they are developing that, we've inspected them.
[02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:44.701]  So it just shows the deception of these people.
[02:52:46.381 --> 02:52:49.402]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[02:52:50.146 --> 02:52:52.889]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[02:52:53.109 --> 02:52:53.870]  I'll just say this.
[02:52:54.471 --> 02:53:01.237]  My new film, The Order of Death, combo'd with Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on one DVD for one low price.
[02:53:01.298 --> 02:53:02.419]  New film is out.
[02:53:02.939 --> 02:53:04.180]  Makes a great Christmas present.
[02:53:04.221 --> 02:53:05.402]  A lot of new books and videos.
[02:53:05.722 --> 02:53:07.184]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:53:07.204 --> 02:53:08.925]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:14.870]  That's all I'm going to say.
[02:53:15.130 --> 02:53:15.951]  They're great films.
[02:53:15.991 --> 02:53:16.591]  You need to have them.
[02:53:16.851 --> 02:53:22.633]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:23.693 --> 02:53:25.954]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Illinois.
[02:53:25.994 --> 02:53:26.414]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:53:26.754 --> 02:53:27.014]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:27.034 --> 02:53:27.594]  How are you doing?
[02:53:27.754 --> 02:53:28.134]  Good, sir.
[02:53:28.214 --> 02:53:28.694]  Alex, listen.
[02:53:28.734 --> 02:53:31.075]  I wish I had more time, but I've got to tell you this real quick.
[02:53:31.475 --> 02:53:33.896]  Local news here in Chicago, CLTV.
[02:53:33.956 --> 02:53:35.656]  It's a cable news channel.
[02:53:36.457 --> 02:53:40.098]  Reported on the bottom, they have the little, I don't know what you call it, the news flashes?
[02:53:40.158 --> 02:53:40.578]  The crawl.
[02:53:41.645 --> 02:53:46.550]  Uh, that this American Legion Hall in Yorkville, Illinois has closed its doors to the Minutemen.
[02:53:47.131 --> 02:53:49.193]  This morning I called the commander of the Minutemen.
[02:53:49.253 --> 02:53:52.236]  He would refuse to talk to me, so the bartender talked to me.
[02:53:52.836 --> 02:54:00.244]  And my computer's down, Alex, but it's AuroraBeaconNews.com, and she admitted that he said that the Minutemen are anti-American.
[02:54:00.968 --> 02:54:04.169]  And he's an American Legion post, and he's an ex-Marine vet.
[02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:07.430]  I said to her, I'm an ex-Air Force vet, and I said, how could he be patriotic?
[02:54:07.450 --> 02:54:08.891]  Do you realize what the men and women are doing?
[02:54:09.311 --> 02:54:11.411]  And what George Bush isn't doing to our borders?
[02:54:11.431 --> 02:54:12.352]  No, no, no, listen.
[02:54:12.452 --> 02:54:16.793]  Open borders, gun control, world government, all of this is conservative.
[02:54:17.433 --> 02:54:18.234]  We're bad.
[02:54:18.254 --> 02:54:19.254]  You haven't figured that out yet?
[02:54:20.137 --> 02:54:23.340]  Dan, but I can't believe that American Legion Hall is going to close the doors to Minutemen.
[02:54:23.420 --> 02:54:31.987]  And I said, if something two men said when they were in his legion drinking, I said, well, if two Marines were drunk and tore up the place, would you close the Legion Hall to Marines?
[02:54:32.547 --> 02:54:33.568]  It doesn't make sense, Alex.
[02:54:33.648 --> 02:54:36.510]  Well, I guarantee you, and I appreciate your call, Mike.
[02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:37.631]  I'm sorry we're out of time here.
[02:54:37.991 --> 02:54:40.113]  I'll try to dig it up, or somebody send it to me and we'll post it.
[02:54:40.133 --> 02:54:43.856]  I mean, I guarantee you they'll go tattle on their neighbor if they smell marijuana.
[02:54:44.457 --> 02:54:48.560]  But, oh, how dare you sit on the border and call the police when you see illegal aliens?
[02:54:49.162 --> 02:54:50.643]  You see, it's the government.
[02:54:50.743 --> 02:54:52.323]  Bush says they're bad.
[02:54:54.004 --> 02:54:56.065]  And then his border plan is to get rid of the border.
[02:54:56.345 --> 02:54:56.785]  They love it!
[02:54:56.885 --> 02:54:57.345]  Oh, good!
[02:54:57.605 --> 02:55:00.566]  See, they don't care about this country, some of these scum.
[02:55:01.067 --> 02:55:03.567]  Steve, and, uh, wherever you're calling from.
[02:55:03.587 --> 02:55:04.508]  Steve, where are you calling us from?
[02:55:05.028 --> 02:55:05.928]  Upper Sacramento.
[02:55:06.068 --> 02:55:06.589]  Welcome, sir.
[02:55:06.609 --> 02:55:08.709]  Uh, today I went to the P.O.
[02:55:08.729 --> 02:55:11.851]  Box and I ordered the stuff for you, the Infowars.com stuff.
[02:55:12.371 --> 02:55:13.291]  I was opening up the P.O.
[02:55:13.311 --> 02:55:14.512]  Box and I got nothing in there.
[02:55:15.452 --> 02:55:16.472]  And they inspected it.
[02:55:16.832 --> 02:55:18.253]  Oh, so they stole it?
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:19.904]  Yeah, I don't know why.
[02:55:19.984 --> 02:55:20.646]  I called the police.
[02:55:20.686 --> 02:55:22.693]  That's what happened.
[02:55:22.773 --> 02:55:24.799]  They sent you a torn up package?
[02:55:25.495 --> 02:55:29.278]  A package opens, come ahead and raise a blade and be cornered, take all the stuff out.
[02:55:29.398 --> 02:55:30.859]  The only thing in there was just the receipt.
[02:55:30.879 --> 02:55:31.799]  Okay, well it's simple.
[02:55:31.859 --> 02:55:34.481]  You send this back to that and you'll get some free stuff for your trouble.
[02:55:35.262 --> 02:55:36.142]  On top of your order.
[02:55:36.823 --> 02:55:38.784]  And we'll have to send it to you UPS, sir.
[02:55:38.804 --> 02:55:39.725]  That's what we mainly use.
[02:55:39.765 --> 02:55:40.526]  We do have problems.
[02:55:41.086 --> 02:55:41.906]  USPS.
[02:55:42.447 --> 02:55:45.329]  And we will go with that and make them pay for it.
[02:55:45.869 --> 02:55:47.090]  And yeah, we have them do that.
[02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:48.991]  They like to steal our material quite a bit.
[02:55:49.652 --> 02:55:50.152]  Oh wow.
[02:55:50.713 --> 02:55:51.853]  It's not a free country, sir.
[02:55:52.234 --> 02:55:54.055]  These people are like Nazis or Communists.
[02:55:55.655 --> 02:55:57.977]  No, I know.
[02:55:58.277 --> 02:55:59.738]  You have a criminal in your area, sir.
[02:55:59.758 --> 02:56:00.338]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:01.139 --> 02:56:02.320]  I apologize to Adam.
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:02.980]  We're out of time.
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:03.721]  Here it is, folks.
[02:56:03.801 --> 02:56:04.361]  It says it all.
[02:56:04.381 --> 02:56:04.881]  God bless you.
