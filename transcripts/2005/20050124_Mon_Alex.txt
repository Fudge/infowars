[00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.375]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:08.116]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:09.917]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.557 --> 00:00:11.398]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:12.979]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.342]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:22.005]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:24.126]  Music
[00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:40.670]  Well, it's already the 24th day of January 2005.
[00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:47.813]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:51.034]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:51.855]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:55.996]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:00.839]  Should anti-Bush journalists be tried as spies?
[00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.140]  This was in the Washington Times.
[00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.801]  And it's the former chief advisor and staffer for Newt Gingrich that's out saying this.
[00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:17.763]  It's not just Michael Weiner or Ann Coulter or the usual subjects.
[00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:28.307]  And this time it's Seymour Hearst, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, who has broken hundreds of huge stories.
[00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:32.829]  And they're calling for his execution.
[00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:40.116]  In an article in the Washington Times, they are calling openly for his execution.
[00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:47.258]  And they're all over the media trying to warm the public up to this idea.
[00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:50.058]  You say something against this corrupt government.
[00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.359]  You expose its corrupt activities.
[00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.120]  We want to kill you.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.121]  We don't just want to put you in prison.
[00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:02.562]  We want to kill you.
[00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:07.398]  Also, tasers are killing people.
[00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:11.682]  Speaking of killing, every week I see multiple articles where it's killing people.
[00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:13.644]  Non-violent individuals in most cases.
[00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:16.627]  Young people, children, old people.
[00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:21.132]  Well, Taser International, they have an answer to this problem.
[00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:23.274]  Increase the power.
[00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:24.535]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.098]  Taser to increase stun guns power.
[00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:30.145]  We'll cover that.
[00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:40.768]  And I want to go over Bush's speech a little bit more from last Thursday at his coronation, where he talked about standing up against evil people.
[00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:54.633]  Where he talked about standing up against tyranny and going up against countries that engage in tyranny, which I find to be pretty ridiculous when our government is totally out of control and
[00:02:56.243 --> 00:03:08.211]  We're only, what, five days away from the Iraqi so-called election?
[00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:10.193]  There is no election.
[00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.534]  The polling places are secret.
[00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:15.516]  No cars are allowed to drive around on election day.
[00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:19.979]  The candidates are secret, other than the government appointees of a year and a half ago.
[00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.721]  They're all running for re-election unopposed.
[00:03:23.484 --> 00:03:31.951]  And I wondered months ago, aloud on air with you, the listeners, how are they going to have an election and call it an election when all these candidates are running unopposed?
[00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:34.374]  How are they going to act like there was an election?
[00:03:34.754 --> 00:03:48.666]  Well, the answer was, a few weeks ago, Christian Science Monitor, the feds came out and said, well, we're not going to let you know who the candidates are, those that are running against the current office holders that were appointed.
[00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:53.129]  And now the polling places are secret as well.
[00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.891]  I mean, I don't have words to describe how ridiculous this is.
[00:03:56.192 --> 00:04:08.702]  We're going to be watching the news and hearing about candidates, and then on the day of the election, they'll... Well, they said the day after the election, or sometime after, they'll then show us who secretly ran and who really won.
[00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:10.984]  And we'll be told that's a real election.
[00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:14.426]  Boy, I guess we'll start having elections like that here.
[00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:16.188]  We almost do already.
[00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.971]  But that's your election.
[00:04:21.283 --> 00:04:25.186]  I want to take your calls on this subject and other pieces of news.
[00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:28.688]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.809]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.455]  We'll spend about 60 seconds with each caller with your question or comment.
[00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:43.258]  If you disagree with me on some issue or you agree, solve a piece of news you want to mention, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.305]  And there is just so many other important news articles we'll be covering.
[00:04:53.946 --> 00:05:00.554]  Harvard Medical School CIO gets chipped on some more of the news that's coming up, so stay with us.
[00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:02.739]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.002]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:10.065]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:14.329]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.452]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.532 --> 00:05:20.434]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:20.614]  Wow.
[00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:23.876]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:28.640]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.842]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:34.884]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:41.489]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.870]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:09.288]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.508 --> 00:06:20.778]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:23.640]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.448]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.608 --> 00:06:32.490]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.697]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:44.624]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:44.944 --> 00:06:48.865]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:49.586]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:50.306]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:04.429]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.013]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:16.180]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.210]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:26.996]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:27.817]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWalk.com.
[00:07:32.103 --> 00:07:39.246]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:46.049]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:50.912]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:07:51.092 --> 00:07:53.633]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:58.435]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:08:02.012 --> 00:08:04.193]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:07.555]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:39.926]  All right, again, ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 24th day of January 2005.
[00:08:40.427 --> 00:08:42.688]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:46.890]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:53.094]  Harvard Medical School CIO gets chipped.
[00:08:53.894 --> 00:08:56.036]  This is out of the South Florida Business Journal.
[00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.778]  The chief of information officer at Harvard Medical School has a chipped
[00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:01.935]  But it's not exactly on his shoulder.
[00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:08.020]  The executive last month received a Verichip from the Delray Beach-based company of the same name.
[00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:22.914]  Verichip Corporation, a subsidiary of Applied Digital Solutions, said John D. Halamaka said he wanted to receive the under-the-skin transponder about the size of a grain of rice to...
[00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:26.512]  Assess it.
[00:09:26.872 --> 00:09:29.434]  The Vera chip went under his skin last month.
[00:09:29.774 --> 00:09:33.558]  He said insertion was a 15-minute outpatient procedure.
[00:09:34.018 --> 00:09:39.963]  There was no residual pain, scar, even a palpable chip, he said in a statement.
[00:09:40.764 --> 00:09:41.364]  He went on to...
[00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:54.808]  Since climbed several mountains, including Mount Washington and sub-freezing temperatures without any restrictions, he also reported that the reader accurately read his identification number all of the time.
[00:09:55.268 --> 00:09:59.089]  The three applications that I envision for the technology are identifying...
[00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:15.193]  The non-responsive patient reducing medical error by using radio frequency identification to positively identify the patient, nurse, and medications during drug administration and verify the right medications are being given to the right patient, he added.
[00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:32.155]  Richard Selig, Verichip Vice President of Medical Applications, said a key medical decision makers, such as Harvard's medical school faculty, become familiar with Verichip systems, the guidance will improve the patient identification and secure access to health care information.
[00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:36.157]  So they're saying they're going to put it in the patients.
[00:10:36.597 --> 00:10:42.940]  That once Harvard Medical School facility workers have it, that they'll become familiar with it,
[00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:51.146]  That's the quote, and that their guidance will improve patient identification and secure access to health care information.
[00:10:52.647 --> 00:10:57.148]  Shares in the parent company were down 4 cents, the $4.93 in morning trading.
[00:10:57.788 --> 00:11:00.529]  The 52-week high was at $8.55 on December 7th.
[00:11:01.049 --> 00:11:04.110]  The 52-week low was $1.94 on May 25th.
[00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:09.712]  So we have Mexican Attorney General getting it, making his staff take it.
[00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:10.332]  We have...
[00:11:11.276 --> 00:11:14.459]  The heads of the Harvard Medical School getting it.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.662]  We have special forces being forced to take it.
[00:11:18.383 --> 00:11:21.566]  We have reports that fighter pilots are being made to take it.
[00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.268]  All of this is starting to happen.
[00:11:25.489 --> 00:11:33.617]  And it's the elite, it's the establishment, or it's those that they have under their control, like people in the military, that they can force to take it, that are now taking it.
[00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:42.331]  And so, we're openly talking about, here in 2005, the move by the media and these corporations to do this.
[00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:45.352]  Openly happening.
[00:11:49.034 --> 00:11:51.915]  Now inside the New World Order.
[00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:55.996]  And then I wanted to get into this medical report.
[00:11:57.537 --> 00:11:59.498]  Very interesting article here.
[00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:29.598]  The day my brain was turned off by a magnet, this is on the London Telegraph, and they're talking about magnetic resonance systems, but now they have these whole families of new devices that don't just scan your brain or your body, but actually change your cellular makeup, the way the cells fire electrochemically.
[00:12:31.098 --> 00:12:36.242]  And I was aware that they wanted to use this for thought crimes.
[00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:45.648]  In fact, they're already using it in the last three years to put you under an MRI and then to claim why it shows you're lying or it shows that you have terrorist leanings.
[00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:53.494]  But yesterday morning, Sunday morning, we were in the kitchen eating breakfast and we had NPR on.
[00:12:53.514 --> 00:12:56.836]  It was probably a 20-minute special report
[00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:09.063]  With all these top scientists on from around the world saying that basically the entire public, a lot of you probably heard this, are going to be made to go under these.
[00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:16.125]  And it was a glowing report about how it's going to treat learning disabilities and find out who's really mentally ill.
[00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:22.787]  There's a lot of mentally ill people out there who are successfully hiding their mental illness.
[00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:27.269]  It went on and on and on and on.
[00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:31.614]  Talking about these new special MRIs.
[00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:35.976]  MRIs that can change brain chemistry.
[00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:38.497]  MRIs that can tell if you're mentally ill.
[00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:41.058]  MRIs that do all of this.
[00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:49.942]  And how great this is going to be for the psychiatrist and the psychologist who've really never known who needs to be going on drugs.
[00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.402]  Well, yeah, because it's not really medical.
[00:13:52.203 --> 00:13:57.645]  And can now put you under these and have new guidelines and decide if you've got mental problems.
[00:13:58.243 --> 00:14:19.698]  Of course, the guidelines will be written by the drug companies and implemented through the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association and the American Association of Psychiatry to where basically the largest possible swath of the public, they'll be able to claim we're mentally ill and why the computer says so, the instrument says so, so it must be true.
[00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:21.800]  It must be true.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.783]  So that's an article I also want to go over and detail just a little bit later because
[00:14:27.392 --> 00:14:31.993]  This will be the new world we're all going to live in where we're put under these brain scanners.
[00:14:32.093 --> 00:14:46.978]  Already, five airports, starting with Boston Logan almost three years ago, have put NASA machines in as part of a test process that passively scan your brain from a distance.
[00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:53.380]  And they pick up areas of your brain being more active that are associated with aggression,
[00:14:54.346 --> 00:15:05.334]  ...or violence or irritation, that is then a reason to pull you out of line and take you into a room and actually put you under a brain scanner and ask you questions.
[00:15:07.455 --> 00:15:11.838]  Again, this is far more advanced than anything in 1984.
[00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.560]  It's right out of Brave New World.
[00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:18.222]  And the government will decide.
[00:15:18.362 --> 00:15:23.466]  They will dictate what brain waves show that you're mentally ill or aggressive...
[00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:24.901]  Paranoid.
[00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:28.562]  This is all part of the new freedom.
[00:15:28.622 --> 00:15:29.642]  Another article here.
[00:15:29.822 --> 00:15:32.082]  School looking at pupil tagging.
[00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:36.643]  From Japan to England to the United States, it's happening.
[00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:44.865]  A school in Swasena is considering tagging its pupils because of a shortage of assistants who can supervise lunch breaks.
[00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:51.686]  The idea is for children at Lola's Primary to wear the tags all day with a buzzer sounding if they leave.
[00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:55.910]  Well, thousands of schools already have that in the U.S.
[00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:02.013]  For years, you wear the little ID tag with the chip in it with the barcode, and if you leave, the alarms go off.
[00:16:02.314 --> 00:16:07.917]  And there's fences around the schools, and police in the schools training you how to be good little prisoners.
[00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:09.944]  We're good to go.
[00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:39.668]  The short of assistance is put down to low pay and unfavorable working hours.
[00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:46.330]  Sarah Reed, the Deputy Children's Commissioner for Wales, said she was concerned by the plans.
[00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:53.913]  I understand that the school needs to worry about the safety of the children, but we are concerned about the effect this is having on human rights of children.
[00:16:55.793 --> 00:17:01.135]  Then continuing, as I mentioned earlier, Taser to increase stun gun powers.
[00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.716]  The New York Times and Reuters are reporting
[00:17:04.489 --> 00:17:17.172]  Stun Gun Maker Taser International Incorporated, responding to a news report that its newest weapon failed to subdue some suspects, said on Friday it is providing software that lets stun guns fire at full power for a longer period.
[00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:18.946]  Ah, yes.
[00:17:18.986 --> 00:17:20.988]  Then we have a flashback to all these articles.
[00:17:21.088 --> 00:17:21.608]  Flashback.
[00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:25.412]  Jarring death rate fuels flap over police tasers.
[00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:26.413]  Flashback.
[00:17:26.874 --> 00:17:27.814]  Taser on children.
[00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:28.936]  Okay, say police.
[00:17:29.556 --> 00:17:30.137]  Flashback.
[00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.319]  Heart expert warns about using tasers.
[00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:33.180]  Flashback.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.362]  Police taser 75-year-old woman.
[00:17:35.642 --> 00:17:36.223]  Flashback.
[00:17:36.283 --> 00:17:40.127]  Teen dies from being shot with taser gun by Collier County deputies.
[00:17:40.587 --> 00:17:41.127]  Flashback.
[00:17:41.407 --> 00:17:42.368]  Tasers can kill.
[00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:42.948]  Flashback.
[00:17:43.248 --> 00:17:46.189]  Police accused of firing taser at pregnant bride.
[00:17:46.509 --> 00:17:48.910]  Police use taser gun to subdue six-year-old student.
[00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:50.131]  Flashback.
[00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:52.232]  Man dies when police use taser gun on him.
[00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:53.212]  Flashback.
[00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:56.773]  Cops taser 14-year-old who wouldn't drop Game Boy.
[00:17:57.193 --> 00:17:57.754]  Flashback.
[00:17:58.294 --> 00:18:01.915]  Warning on police use of stun guns after 74 die in the last two years.
[00:18:06.434 --> 00:18:08.775]  Flashback, flashback, flashback.
[00:18:09.195 --> 00:18:14.076]  There's a lot more flashbacks, but we won't go over all of them here because we only have three hours.
[00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:18.997]  And then there's this article that I want to cover after we take some calls.
[00:18:19.177 --> 00:18:22.198]  First off, this was out of the Washington Times.
[00:18:22.338 --> 00:18:25.139]  Great analysis on it by the New American Magazine.
[00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:28.879]  Should anti-Bush journalists be tried as spies?
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:30.940]  Then in the article...
[00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:41.622]  Mr. Blakely, the former minion of the ultra-neocon, ultra-liberal Newt Gingrich, calls for execution!
[00:18:42.962 --> 00:18:44.202]  Execution!
[00:18:46.263 --> 00:18:58.207]  Of Seymour Hersh, Cy Hersh, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, for simply reporting what foreign governments were openly reporting, the plan to invade Iran.
[00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:04.180]  That's been in the news for about six months, but I guess it really becomes news when Hirsch writes about it.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.901]  I'm not saying he doesn't break stories, but he didn't break this.
[00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:13.183]  He didn't break the fact that special forces are already in Iran, that special forces are already in Syria.
[00:19:13.683 --> 00:19:15.984]  That's been in mainstream news for a year.
[00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:19.186]  They've been in Syria, bombing and killing and strafing.
[00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:21.086]  There's Pentagon press releases.
[00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:22.387]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:25.548]  He criticized it, and so his execution...
[00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:31.467]  Imagine, openly in the newspaper, let's grab him and let's execute him.
[00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:34.108]  Yes, that's American freedom.
[00:19:35.989 --> 00:19:37.629]  That's American freedom now.
[00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:39.750]  Let's execute him.
[00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.311]  Mark, Ron, Eric, others.
[00:19:43.007 --> 00:19:44.669]  Your calls are coming up after this break.
[00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:47.451]  Got some big guests today for you as well.
[00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:52.576]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv are just some of my great websites.
[00:19:52.897 --> 00:19:54.618]  Don't forget infowars.net.
[00:19:55.099 --> 00:19:59.123]  We'll be back after this quick break, so please keep it locked in.
[00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:09.402]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:09.823 --> 00:20:14.067]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:14.307 --> 00:20:21.334]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.714 --> 00:20:27.840]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.181]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:29.821]  We're good to go.
[00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.389]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:20:49.409 --> 00:20:49.449]  866-885-6625.
[00:20:49.469 --> 00:20:49.569]  866-885-6625.
[00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:50.729]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:50.949]  Call today.
[00:21:02.446 --> 00:21:04.687]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:21:05.107 --> 00:21:09.470]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:15.533]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:21:15.773 --> 00:21:19.835]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:21:20.116 --> 00:21:25.759]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:21:25.879 --> 00:21:28.500]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:34.483]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:21:34.523 --> 00:21:36.905]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:39.546]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:21:39.927 --> 00:21:43.549]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:50.233]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:21:50.673 --> 00:21:51.654]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:21:51.674 --> 00:21:52.434]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.474 --> 00:21:52.714]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.078 --> 00:22:01.819]  Terrorism.
[00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:02.739]  Terrorism.
[00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:03.700]  Chemical attacks.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.441]  Dirty bombs.
[00:22:04.521 --> 00:22:04.941]  Fallout.
[00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:06.022]  Biological attack.
[00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:06.723]  Anthrax.
[00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:08.924]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:10.786]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:22:11.026 --> 00:22:13.488]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:28.460]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:28.800]  government.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.782]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:37.063]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:37.203 --> 00:22:41.704]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:51.366]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:03.848]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:23:04.088 --> 00:23:04.408]  Why?
[00:23:04.428 --> 00:23:07.368]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:23:07.468 --> 00:23:12.389]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:22.231]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:24:01.124 --> 00:24:07.110]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:52.078]  I just got a call from Mike Hanson, who does some camera work for me, and I'm friends with him and his brother, who's an Austin police officer, and he told me that he was there and actually got video of what's been on the news this weekend here in Austin, where the black bloc anarchists, they're the violent anarchists, and we've proven that they're federally controlled, actually were beating police in the head with pipes,
[00:24:53.317 --> 00:24:57.999]  And speaking of tasers, Mike's brother tasered one of them.
[00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:00.020]  Start beating me in the head with a pipe.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:00.821]  I'm not going to taser you.
[00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:01.701]  I'm going to do something else.
[00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:05.243]  And then the police department won't release that footage.
[00:25:06.023 --> 00:25:13.487]  And they're actually, the city and others are actually acting like the police are bad, which is always a telltale sign of a federal operation.
[00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:15.148]  It's not a federal operation.
[00:25:15.168 --> 00:25:16.488]  They won't demonize the police.
[00:25:17.068 --> 00:25:19.870]  And why they're pulling this, I have no idea, but...
[00:25:20.774 --> 00:25:23.695]  Mike called me during the break and he's trying to get through right now.
[00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:28.757]  That's why we're having to not let some folks have one of the phone lines so we can get Mike on.
[00:25:29.857 --> 00:25:33.279]  But there's just so much more we're going to be covering today.
[00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:34.479]  Right now, let's go to Bart.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.700]  Bart, where are you calling us from today?
[00:25:39.481 --> 00:25:40.041]  Hello, Bart.
[00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:40.942]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:25:41.722 --> 00:25:42.842]  Calling from Houston, Alex.
[00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:43.443]  Can you hear me?
[00:25:43.463 --> 00:25:44.143]  Yes, I sure can.
[00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:52.385]  Well, you know, a real quick note, I think, you know, these anarchists always being back, that's a real easy way to associate with the resistance movement.
[00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:55.747]  I think that's probably a styops operation to deny resistance.
[00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:57.088]  Well, not probably.
[00:25:57.629 --> 00:25:58.249]  Not probably.
[00:25:58.289 --> 00:26:06.694]  In my film, The Takeover, we have police, the local newspaper, and the local newscast, as well as amateur video in Seattle, where the Delta Force...
[00:26:07.354 --> 00:26:08.855]  It's classic, but that's not why I was calling.
[00:26:08.935 --> 00:26:09.396]  I was calling...
[00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:46.540]  You know, I called in last week about this indie media conference coming up, and the reason I keep harping on this is I really think it would be important for info warriors such as yourself and any of your listeners to show up to that.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:27:01.512]  And the reason I say that is indie media is a really good, you know, youth movement primarily coalescing around independent media, but the problem is is so many of the people involved in it are leftists and they're caught up in that false left-right paradigm.
[00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:02.586]  No, they are.
[00:27:02.606 --> 00:27:05.648]  They can only see the corruption of the phony right wing.
[00:27:05.688 --> 00:27:08.229]  But I'll tell you, the indie media sites are huge.
[00:27:08.249 --> 00:27:09.570]  They're all over the world now.
[00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.011]  And anybody can go and start their own indie media site, folks.
[00:27:13.532 --> 00:27:22.896]  With your town or city's name, if one isn't already set up, start posting news, put a message board up, go out and shoot your own video, take your own photographs, write your own articles.
[00:27:23.436 --> 00:27:26.078]  And yes, everybody should start their own indie media site.
[00:27:26.118 --> 00:27:26.398]  Go ahead.
[00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:37.382]  Well, just again, I think that all the info warriors out there need to go out there and need to try and confront and educate some of these people so that we can really start shattering through that left-right paradigm.
[00:27:38.882 --> 00:27:39.842]  Listen, I agree with you.
[00:27:39.882 --> 00:27:42.843]  When is the meeting going to be?
[00:27:42.943 --> 00:27:49.845]  The conference is going to be going on the weekend of February the 18th through the 20th in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:55.286]  I think you can go online to indyconference.org or .com and get more information.
[00:27:55.894 --> 00:27:58.696]  A lot of, like Amy Goodman's going to be there.
[00:27:58.736 --> 00:28:04.500]  I'd really love to see some hard questions put to her because she's so... No, I think I want to go to that.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.181]  Thanks for the call.
[00:28:05.201 --> 00:28:05.861]  I appreciate it.
[00:28:05.921 --> 00:28:08.223]  All right, now we've got Mike on the line with us.
[00:28:08.243 --> 00:28:10.425]  We've just got a few minutes before we break here.
[00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:19.319]  And, Mike, it's been all over the news, but you were there, you got footage, the police got footage, but the police aren't releasing their footage.
[00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:24.663]  We've just got your footage, and that'll be on the TV show hopefully tomorrow night so folks can later see it.
[00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:27.005]  But tell me what happened to your brother.
[00:28:27.345 --> 00:28:28.426]  Okay, well, hold on, Alex.
[00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.488]  I didn't get a chance to talk to you that much.
[00:28:30.968 --> 00:28:36.831]  My brother was there and he cannot get his side of the story out because he will be fired by the Austin Police Department.
[00:28:37.232 --> 00:28:43.895]  So I'm having to go on KI and all these other stations to defend his honor.
[00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:54.541]  These black block anarchists, same kind of ilk that did the breaking the windows and property damage in Seattle,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:18.599]  We're at the protest down on the Congress Bridge Thursday afternoon and what happened was everybody, 99.9% of the people he said were very, very polite and very non-violent, but it was just this small group that were dressed in black masks and black that came up and tried to break through the police line.
[00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:20.761]  They hit one of them over the head with a
[00:29:21.497 --> 00:29:22.258]  Well, stay there.
[00:29:22.278 --> 00:29:23.118]  We'll talk about it.
[00:29:23.138 --> 00:29:26.200]  Again, I've had these black bloc people threaten to kill me.
[00:29:51.861 --> 00:29:52.781]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:54.902]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:05.967]  are located?

[00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:03.438]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.498 --> 00:32:05.880]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.141]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:07.501 --> 00:32:08.702]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:09.042 --> 00:32:11.464]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.884 --> 00:32:15.286]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.707 --> 00:32:19.549]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:21.050]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:21.511 --> 00:32:25.974]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:26.414 --> 00:32:30.397]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.917 --> 00:32:36.799]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.

[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.922]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:50.362 --> 00:32:50.582]  That's 1-800-453-2202.

[00:32:52.282 --> 00:32:52.602]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:33:06.992 --> 00:33:11.095]  All right, coming up, more on Harvard Medical School Dean.
[00:33:11.955 --> 00:33:13.896]  Gets an implantable microchip.
[00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:24.843]  Also, the day my brain was turned off by a magnet, the London Telegraph, they're not just going to use MRIs to scan your brain now to see if you're a thought criminal.
[00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:28.125]  They're going to use them to change your brain chemistry.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.782]  Look, I'm going to read the Washington Times article.
[00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:01.262]  Now that's not going to cow me.
[00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:02.483]  That's not going to scare me.
[00:34:02.523 --> 00:34:04.104]  That proves everything we've been talking about.
[00:34:04.364 --> 00:34:07.807]  That shows how effective we are exposing this new world order.
[00:34:08.407 --> 00:34:22.218]  Jimmy Walter, the multi-millionaire who spent three plus million dollars exposing the controlled demolition of Building 7 and what happened on 9-11 with TV and radio ads and print ads and Newsweek and everything else.
[00:34:23.453 --> 00:34:25.154]  He's about to be joining us here in a few minutes.
[00:34:25.414 --> 00:34:27.056]  He's now helping the firefighters.
[00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:35.561]  You know, they got $96 million funded to them, the firefighters and police and emergency workers, and they admit the building was built out of asbestos.
[00:34:35.581 --> 00:34:36.502]  That's mainstream news.
[00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:38.103]  They admit it was pulverized to dust.
[00:34:38.684 --> 00:34:42.926]  They admit that people died, thousands are sick.
[00:34:43.027 --> 00:34:44.608]  Even New Scientist has done...
[00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:50.941]  Speaking of MRIs, scans of the lungs and found all this asbestos and other stuff.
[00:34:51.582 --> 00:34:56.164]  And Bush told Christina Todd Whitman two years ago, hey, no funding.
[00:34:56.704 --> 00:34:57.064]  Nothing.
[00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:58.205]  No.
[00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:00.206]  You do not fund them.
[00:35:00.786 --> 00:35:01.626]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.207]  He's helping them sue.
[00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:05.109]  And this is great news.
[00:35:05.149 --> 00:35:06.390]  So Jimmy's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:15.873]  But right now, Mike Hanson, who helps run my TV show and also does some camera work for me, good friend of many years, snuck into Bohemian Grove with me back in 2000, riding a shotgun with me on that.
[00:35:16.313 --> 00:35:21.635]  Mike's brother, who I've been out to eat with, known for about 10 years, good friend of mine, is a good cop.
[00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:29.618]  I mean, he sees me and waves at me, and I pull over and say hi, and, you know, he doesn't like the police state, and he's really a good, nice guy.
[00:35:30.513 --> 00:35:31.834]  And knows about the New World Order.
[00:35:31.854 --> 00:35:40.559]  Don't want to get him in too much trouble here, but the point is, he was downtown when these anarchists, this black bloc, and back in 1999, they had the Fortune 500 rally.
[00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:42.720]  About a thousand demonstrators.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.601]  We even have video of this.
[00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.442]  In fact, Mike, you've got to dig that back up.
[00:35:45.462 --> 00:35:51.225]  We've got to put that on TV so folks can see that again and put that on the website, but on presentplanet.tv.
[00:35:51.845 --> 00:36:00.090]  But I'm down there, and these two huge cops are in black ski mask outfits starting fights, and I go, they're cops, they're cops, they're provocateuring.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.643]  And then all of a sudden, all these cops run across the street and go, Back off, Jones!
[00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:13.248]  Then they insert two more provocateur cops, and then the black block walks over to me and goes, Jones, get out of here!
[00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:13.989]  And I said, No.
[00:36:14.649 --> 00:36:15.510]  These are the anarchists.
[00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.632]  And he goes, I'm going to kill you if you don't.
[00:36:18.372 --> 00:36:21.574]  And I said, Oh, you work for those guys up on the roofs with the cameras.
[00:36:21.955 --> 00:36:24.076]  And I pointed up to FBI taking pictures of people.
[00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:26.738]  And I said, You know, how dare you?
[00:36:27.398 --> 00:36:29.880]  And we've got all this on tape.
[00:36:30.761 --> 00:36:30.821]  Uh...
[00:36:31.696 --> 00:36:32.896]  Just amazing stuff.
[00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:36.017]  And so, in Seattle, they hired these people.
[00:36:36.777 --> 00:36:38.198]  That's been documented.
[00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:45.139]  Out of 60,000 peaceful protesters, you had 50 hired thugs, housed in a government building, paid, fed.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.121]  They were allowed to beat police, throw bottles at them, hit them in the heads, burn trash cans, knock out windows.
[00:36:51.341 --> 00:36:53.082]  And the cops were told, do not arrest them.
[00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:54.962]  The media got footage of them.
[00:36:55.502 --> 00:36:58.623]  They then retreat, and the police attack the peaceful protesters.
[00:36:59.495 --> 00:37:02.556]  And if local cops try to stop them, they get in trouble, too.
[00:37:02.936 --> 00:37:07.458]  Now, Mike, in a nutshell, this weekend, tell folks what happened and what happened to your brother.
[00:37:08.078 --> 00:37:12.279]  You won't believe this story because I could not believe it myself.
[00:37:12.299 --> 00:37:12.860]  Yes, I will.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:23.023]  Okay, first of all, we need to tell people that I will stand against any bad cops any day long, but I'm going to support good, well-trained peace officers like my brother.
[00:37:23.698 --> 00:37:24.919]  Officer William Hanson.
[00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:28.302]  And he is not allowed to talk about this because they will fire him.
[00:37:28.342 --> 00:37:30.483]  I think it's wrong that he cannot defend his honor.
[00:37:30.884 --> 00:37:42.052]  What happened was he was assigned on duty when they were having the protest about Bush being elected again down on Congress Avenue Bridge.
[00:37:42.072 --> 00:37:52.280]  But there was also... This black Pudit group broke off, he said, and took over 6th Street for 30 minutes and they did not do anything
[00:37:53.697 --> 00:37:59.461]  To interfere with them because the police did not want to have any trouble with them because they did have trouble back in 2003.
[00:37:59.661 --> 00:38:03.484]  That's because the higher level people knew what was going on.
[00:38:03.504 --> 00:38:04.064]  Go ahead.
[00:38:04.145 --> 00:38:10.409]  Okay, then when they got down to the bridge, they let them have a whole lane and the sidewalk, he said.
[00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:13.100]  Everything was fine.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.683]  All the people were saying thanks for blocking the intercession.
[00:38:16.723 --> 00:38:18.384]  We won't get hurt and da-da-da.
[00:38:18.725 --> 00:38:19.786]  And everything was going fine.
[00:38:20.086 --> 00:38:26.491]  This small little group of black masks wearing all black individuals.
[00:38:26.571 --> 00:38:30.775]  By the way, they're the same people that ran around New York burning things in the middle of the street.
[00:38:31.015 --> 00:38:31.956]  Then they'd pull back.
[00:38:32.056 --> 00:38:32.636]  I have video.
[00:38:32.856 --> 00:38:35.279]  The cops just leave them alone and go arrest peaceful people.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.543]  One of the women that was in that group
[00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:46.453]  Hit one of the officers over the head with some kind of pipe or pole or something.
[00:38:47.094 --> 00:38:58.183]  At that point, another one with a skateboard came out of the crowd after they were trying to arrest her for doing that for a felony assault on a police officer.
[00:38:58.743 --> 00:39:02.006]  Tried to get a hold of her and pull her back into the crowd.
[00:39:03.187 --> 00:39:08.671]  Then another one from the group came over and tried to pull...
[00:39:09.318 --> 00:39:10.120]  I think so.
[00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:21.649]  Your brother's a bicycle cop now?
[00:39:21.669 --> 00:39:22.390]  Yes, he is.
[00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.430]  He lost a lot of weight doing it.
[00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:39.733]  And by the way, the reason why he is a bicycle cop on 6th Street now is because he used to work for many, many years out in southwest Austin, which is a beautiful part of town out where you live, Alex, is because he tried to report a bad cop two or three times.
[00:39:39.853 --> 00:39:40.793]  Oh, I remember that, yeah.
[00:39:40.813 --> 00:39:45.354]  And they got tired of him, so they transferred him to the worst job it is.
[00:39:46.054 --> 00:39:47.494]  It is downtown on 6th Street.
[00:39:49.016 --> 00:39:51.478]  So... Well, you know what, Mike?
[00:39:51.538 --> 00:39:52.859]  I've got Jimmy Walter here.
[00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:53.779]  Will you do me a favor?
[00:39:53.799 --> 00:39:54.800]  Will you call back in?
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.480]  Hold on a second.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:55.861]  Okay.
[00:39:55.881 --> 00:39:56.701]  I want to talk about this.
[00:39:57.081 --> 00:39:58.762]  Will you call back in and finish the story?
[00:39:58.822 --> 00:40:01.644]  Okay, but let me just say this real quick, Alex, and then I'll call back in.
[00:40:01.684 --> 00:40:02.064]  Well, hold on.
[00:40:02.084 --> 00:40:04.366]  I'm saying... Then they turn around and edit the tape.
[00:40:04.446 --> 00:40:10.530]  They edit the tape where the lady hits the guy, the police officer.
[00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:15.052]  They edit that out, and they just start from the point where the police defend themselves.
[00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.193]  Who edits the tape?
[00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:16.753]  Indy Media.
[00:40:16.874 --> 00:40:17.494]  Indy Media.
[00:40:17.834 --> 00:40:23.478]  And that's what they gave to all the... And then they said my brother was tasing the guy on the ground when that's not true.
[00:40:23.538 --> 00:40:27.100]  They edited that part out and put the tasering sound on top of it.
[00:40:27.601 --> 00:40:30.723]  So, I mean, it's just outrageous what they tried to do to my brother.
[00:40:31.083 --> 00:40:35.886]  And I'm not going to put up with them trying to call my brother and make him out to be a monster and a racist.
[00:40:36.006 --> 00:40:37.087]  I'm just not going to put up with it.
[00:40:38.368 --> 00:40:40.529]  Well, I mean, the indie media is like any other media.
[00:40:40.549 --> 00:40:42.070]  It's a diverse crowd, just like the police.
[00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.811]  There's good ones, there's bad ones, there's ugly ones.
[00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:45.431]  But I want to hear the rest of the story.
[00:40:45.912 --> 00:40:49.073]  Call me in the middle of the next hour, bottom of the next hour, Mike.
[00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:51.194]  Call in or we'll call you, okay?
[00:40:51.214 --> 00:40:52.175]  Okay, what time is that?
[00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:55.256]  Well, an hour from now, the bottom of the next hour.
[00:40:55.736 --> 00:40:56.076]  Okay.
[00:40:56.477 --> 00:40:57.617]  So 50 minutes from now.
[00:40:58.077 --> 00:40:58.738]  All right, God bless.
[00:40:58.918 --> 00:40:59.978]  Thank you, I appreciate it.
[00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.579]  Now, I know Mike's brother real good.
[00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:05.841]  Been to a lot of barbecues with him and good friends with him, and he is a good cop.
[00:41:06.878 --> 00:41:08.639]  And done a lot of really good stuff.
[00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:10.581]  Been on the force, I don't know, a long time.
[00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.661]  15, 16, 17 years.
[00:41:12.522 --> 00:41:13.563]  And this is just horrible.
[00:41:13.803 --> 00:41:20.567]  All right, joining us, again standing up for good cops and good firemen, is Jimmy Walter, spending his own money.
[00:41:20.907 --> 00:41:25.390]  And boy, they better watch out now, because he's already spent three plus mil exposing 9-11.
[00:41:27.134 --> 00:41:33.499]  And giving my video away, giving other videos away, selling some, trying to recoup some of it.
[00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:40.224]  But now he's just spending his own money to help get treatment to the firemen and police officers.
[00:41:40.925 --> 00:41:42.406]  Jimmy Walter, good to have you on with us.
[00:41:42.426 --> 00:41:43.066]  Thanks for holding.
[00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.688]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[00:41:44.728 --> 00:41:49.672]  And I'm really, you know, that friend of yours, that cop, he's really getting a shaft there.
[00:41:49.792 --> 00:41:51.313]  Please do something about that if you can't.
[00:41:51.972 --> 00:41:53.713]  Well, I'm sure there's more to it.
[00:41:53.753 --> 00:41:57.356]  I mean, I know for a fact these black bloc people work for the feds.
[00:41:57.796 --> 00:41:58.057]  Yeah.
[00:41:58.257 --> 00:41:59.598]  And they're called provocateurs.
[00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:01.659]  Agent provocateurs.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:16.811]  Jimmy, just in kind of a thumbnail sketch, tell us about yourself for those that don't know who you are, your website, and your movement, and then let's get into what you're doing exposing what's happening with the WTC cough.
[00:42:17.955 --> 00:42:18.375]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:18.415 --> 00:42:42.052]  Well, I got into the anti-war thing almost from the beginning because I started researching after 9-1-1 what was going on and found out in the international press that Saddam Hussein, in fact, fought al-Qaeda tooth and nail and had no weapons of mass destruction, no poison factories, yet the mainstream media was lying, lying, lying about it.
[00:42:42.732 --> 00:42:44.293]  And it was just...
[00:42:45.643 --> 00:42:46.083]  Absurd.
[00:42:46.123 --> 00:42:49.304]  So I started running full-page ads back then.
[00:42:49.944 --> 00:42:59.627]  After Mission Accomplished, I ran into Eric Huffschmidt at one of the anti-war rallies and got his book and video, but never gave him the time of day.
[00:42:59.767 --> 00:43:04.169]  I thought, hey, the impact, the fires, that's what brought down the towers.
[00:43:04.869 --> 00:43:06.850]  No way they were brought down with explosives.
[00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.651]  I had them for about six months until a friend of mine told me into watching them.
[00:43:12.271 --> 00:43:13.932]  Then I knew from looking at them
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.203]  In slow motion, that those buildings were blown up with explosives.
[00:43:18.243 --> 00:43:19.684]  There's no doubt about it at all.
[00:43:19.704 --> 00:43:22.647]  Well, since then, Larry Silverstein says they blew up seven.
[00:43:23.327 --> 00:43:24.328]  I know, on tape.
[00:43:24.408 --> 00:43:29.892]  But the Federal Emergency Management Agency must have missed that movie because they don't know how it happened.
[00:43:30.413 --> 00:43:32.074]  So you have all these conflicting stories.
[00:43:32.154 --> 00:43:37.178]  But all that notwithstanding, when those buildings were exploded...
[00:43:37.931 --> 00:43:38.351]  We're good.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.382]  The metal beams from the fire was over 200,000 pounds.
[00:44:05.903 --> 00:44:13.006]  Enough mercury from all of the fluorescent light bulbs to contaminate 2,500 city blocks.
[00:44:13.666 --> 00:44:22.250]  The highest levels of vanadium ever recorded on the surface of the earth, including volcanoes and the burning Iraqi oil wells.
[00:44:24.284 --> 00:44:35.091]  The White House Council on Environmental Quality censored the EPA from warning the people of New York about this on September 13th, two days afterwards.
[00:44:35.111 --> 00:44:36.171]  Now let's go over this.
[00:44:36.692 --> 00:44:49.759]  Their own report then that came out later said it is this horrible toxic waste dump, asbestos, mercury, all of it, and Bush said issue, and this has come out, mainstream news, issue a false report, tell them it's fine.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.021]  Where did you see this?
[00:44:52.734 --> 00:44:56.455]  Oh, that came out about two years ago when he ordered them to censor the report.
[00:44:56.495 --> 00:44:57.435]  I'm sure you heard about that.
[00:44:57.875 --> 00:44:59.455]  Well, I know that it was censored.
[00:44:59.575 --> 00:45:02.996]  If you could get me a copy of that order, I'd sure like to have it.
[00:45:03.016 --> 00:45:05.436]  Yeah, I'm actually finishing up a new film right now.
[00:45:05.456 --> 00:45:07.017]  I'm even putting those articles in the film, yeah.
[00:45:07.377 --> 00:45:07.997]  All right, good.
[00:45:08.417 --> 00:45:18.259]  Which reminds me that I also have to tell you we are giving away a free DVD of the event we put on last year at September 11th in New York City.
[00:45:18.835 --> 00:45:30.381]  It has a clip from Your Road to Tyranny in it about the 1993 FBI bombing of the World Trade Center.
[00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:35.564]  We have David Ray Griffin, David Von Kleist.
[00:45:36.044 --> 00:45:37.925]  We've got Tartley, Swicker.
[00:45:38.556 --> 00:45:39.377]  Thank you very much.
[00:45:56.127 --> 00:46:00.413]  We're going to be going to start printing, I think, about the 1st of February.
[00:46:00.453 --> 00:46:05.380]  We've got a final thing, shipping it to the DVD manufacturer today.
[00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:07.123]  And pass it on to your friends.
[00:46:07.383 --> 00:46:08.325]  Absolutely free.
[00:46:08.385 --> 00:46:10.548]  It's over four hours long.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.922]  On 911, absolutely free.
[00:46:13.942 --> 00:46:14.742]  Well, that's exciting.
[00:46:14.762 --> 00:46:16.304]  We'll give out that info again in a second.
[00:46:16.704 --> 00:46:26.711]  But getting back into the firefighters, I mean, it's admitted that these buildings were coated in asbestos and that there were all these lawsuits going on.
[00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:28.612]  There was going to have to be all these funds.
[00:46:28.632 --> 00:46:32.535]  They weren't allowed to use the respirators in order not to scare the public.
[00:46:32.635 --> 00:46:33.656]  That's in the report, too.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:35.420]  That's right.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:35.961]  Go over that.
[00:46:36.081 --> 00:46:38.823]  Oh, don't wear respirators because you don't want to scare people.
[00:46:39.323 --> 00:46:39.544]  Right.
[00:46:40.104 --> 00:46:43.547]  And the firefighters now, they've lost all their hairs.
[00:46:43.587 --> 00:46:45.388]  Gordon Skinner's coming out with a movie.
[00:46:45.688 --> 00:46:46.789]  He's got some of them in it.
[00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:47.910]  They've lost their hair.
[00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:48.651]  They can't work.
[00:46:48.711 --> 00:46:50.592]  Half of the guys down there can't work anymore.
[00:46:50.852 --> 00:46:53.455]  Half of the cleanup crew have serious respiratory problems.
[00:46:53.895 --> 00:47:00.060]  Children and the schools around there have serious respiratory problems.
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.541]  And all because of these lies.
[00:47:02.303 --> 00:47:08.270]  And if anybody dies, and somebody's going to die from it, at least a shorter life, that's second degree murder.
[00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:12.714]  And if they don't die, it's aggravated assault in the first degree.
[00:47:12.975 --> 00:47:24.567]  Well, I want to stop right there, because when I was at Ground Zero a few months ago, I would talk about this, and firefighters would be nodding their heads and come up and shake my hand.
[00:47:25.487 --> 00:47:36.312]  But I found that most of the police, I've got them on video while I'm talking, I'm sitting there talking to them, all lined up with their machine guns in front of Ground Zero, you know, in their Darth Vader outfits, they were laughing at me.
[00:47:36.973 --> 00:47:49.439]  And I don't know how it's funny how they'd laugh at me when they admit that this asbestos did this, when it's been all over the news, when New Scientist magazine did the chest scans with an MRI and found all these problems.
[00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:51.600]  I mean, I wonder why they're laughing.
[00:47:52.688 --> 00:47:59.635]  Well, they're laughing because they know that even though you know, you can't do a damn thing about it because they've got the guns.
[00:48:00.957 --> 00:48:02.579]  Yeah, but it's killing them.
[00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:07.584]  So it's funny that I'm trying to save them or that you're trying to help them?
[00:48:07.604 --> 00:48:09.526]  You know, you can't understand.
[00:48:09.546 --> 00:48:13.310]  A, the people down there were selected to be down there.
[00:48:14.002 --> 00:48:16.144]  And two, you can't judge all cops by them.
[00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:18.425]  I was in New York protesting when you were there as well.
[00:48:18.846 --> 00:48:20.247]  Some cops give you a hard time.
[00:48:20.287 --> 00:48:21.888]  Some cops treat you right.
[00:48:21.928 --> 00:48:22.788]  You've just got to be careful.
[00:48:22.808 --> 00:48:23.349]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:48:23.369 --> 00:48:24.309]  I mean, exactly.
[00:48:24.329 --> 00:48:26.871]  I'm talking about the special, you know, SWAT team cops.
[00:48:26.891 --> 00:48:35.197]  Right, but those guys, those guys are, you know, Bush now has a battalion guard of 13,000 troops and people.
[00:48:35.778 --> 00:48:42.983]  Did you know there were 66,000 police and military on hand at the coronation last week?
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.121]  It was pitiful.
[00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:47.622]  $40 million on that.
[00:48:48.523 --> 00:48:50.764]  You know, it's just ridiculous.
[00:48:50.904 --> 00:48:53.725]  And I've got a clip where they're going, Our great leader!
[00:48:53.845 --> 00:48:54.606]  Look at him!
[00:48:54.986 --> 00:48:55.766]  Praise him!
[00:48:55.786 --> 00:48:58.688]  Let America know you love America!
[00:48:58.968 --> 00:49:00.749]  Did you read his inaugural speech?
[00:49:01.952 --> 00:49:09.076]  Yeah, he said liberty 16 times, and he said freedom 20-something times.
[00:49:09.817 --> 00:49:14.439]  But he said, and then there came a day of fire.
[00:49:14.459 --> 00:49:16.761]  He's speaking out of the Bible.
[00:49:16.841 --> 00:49:18.882]  He is getting ready for Armageddon.
[00:49:19.221 --> 00:49:22.142]  This guy is stark raving mad.
[00:49:22.982 --> 00:49:24.783]  Read the last line.
[00:49:25.423 --> 00:49:26.363]  I sent out an email.
[00:49:26.683 --> 00:49:29.584]  I dissected everything he said there.
[00:49:29.624 --> 00:49:30.744]  Be afraid.
[00:49:30.824 --> 00:49:32.005]  Be very afraid.
[00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:36.686]  He's trying to invoke and manipulate good Christians, but it's very cynical.
[00:49:36.726 --> 00:49:37.826]  The guy's a Luciferian.
[00:49:37.846 --> 00:49:40.087]  But, Jimmy, let me add this to what you're saying.
[00:49:40.107 --> 00:49:40.827]  It's all important.
[00:49:41.941 --> 00:49:52.708]  He talks about, and the evil will come across our borders, and all this cryptic language, and then Mr. Stewart from the Daily Show said, what, have we elected the dungeon keeper?
[00:49:52.728 --> 00:49:57.931]  The gatekeeper, I think.
[00:49:58.812 --> 00:50:02.154]  No, but I mean, certainly he's getting ready for World War III.
[00:50:02.454 --> 00:50:04.995]  He does have a messianic complex, like Hitler did.
[00:50:05.356 --> 00:50:08.758]  Yeah, and did you see how cocky he was?
[00:50:11.067 --> 00:50:13.770]  If you read that speech, he doesn't think anybody could stop him.
[00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.592]  But that's the whole point about this health issue.
[00:50:15.952 --> 00:50:16.793]  There are no Arabs.
[00:50:17.094 --> 00:50:17.955]  There are no Muslims.
[00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:20.617]  There are no hijackers involved in this health issue.
[00:50:20.838 --> 00:50:22.940]  There are only United States.
[00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:31.713]  New York and New York City and government officials involved with a clear, documented, paper trail.
[00:50:31.773 --> 00:50:32.333]  And it's admitted.
[00:50:32.393 --> 00:50:32.673]  They knew.
[00:50:32.693 --> 00:50:33.694]  They wanted to testify.
[00:50:33.794 --> 00:50:34.334]  They knew.
[00:50:34.574 --> 00:50:35.314]  They covered it up.
[00:50:35.515 --> 00:50:38.316]  It's like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.
[00:50:38.396 --> 00:50:38.896]  Exactly.
[00:50:38.956 --> 00:50:40.857]  You can't get him for the murder and the racketeering.
[00:50:40.877 --> 00:50:42.317]  You get him on something small.
[00:50:42.697 --> 00:50:43.638]  But it isn't small.
[00:50:43.918 --> 00:50:46.959]  We're talking about children and citizens and police.
[00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:52.701]  Aggregate first degree battery is a second degree felony.
[00:50:53.001 --> 00:50:55.342]  And they'll start ratting to get out of the jail.
[00:50:55.382 --> 00:50:56.122]  That's what it'll do.
[00:50:56.162 --> 00:50:57.483]  The whole thing will come unraveled.
[00:50:57.743 --> 00:50:58.263]  Incredible.
[00:50:58.283 --> 00:50:58.863]  Stay there, Jimmy.
[00:50:58.903 --> 00:50:59.643]  I want to talk about it.
[00:51:01.464 --> 00:51:05.805]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:10.117]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.718 --> 00:54:13.682]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:29.435 --> 00:54:31.657]  All right, folks, we're back live with Jimmy Walter.
[00:54:31.677 --> 00:54:33.118]  We're about to go back to him in just a second.
[00:54:33.138 --> 00:54:35.660]  I want to keep him with us a little bit into the next hour.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.324]  We're going to go to Mark and Ron and Jason and Eric and everybody else that's patiently holding as well.
[00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:50.011]  And there's so much other news coming up that, believe me, you do not want to miss, like the neocons calling for executing anyone that criticizes the government.
[00:54:50.271 --> 00:54:52.233]  And this isn't Michael Wiener Savage.
[00:54:52.253 --> 00:54:55.456]  It isn't Ann Psychopath Coulter.
[00:54:56.817 --> 00:54:58.338]  Ultra-liberals, if they are,
[00:54:59.523 --> 00:55:03.624]  Ultra-communist that they are, literally, by their own definitions.
[00:55:04.104 --> 00:55:08.325]  I don't believe in all those definitions, but that's what they're closer to on their full spectrum.
[00:55:09.525 --> 00:55:11.586]  Now it's the Washington Times with articles.
[00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:14.767]  Let's just start executing people.
[00:55:15.267 --> 00:55:19.808]  Cy Hirsch, the most award-winning reporter still alive today.
[00:55:19.888 --> 00:55:21.148]  I mean, he's a legend.
[00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:22.289]  Let's execute him.
[00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:24.129]  They're serious, folks.
[00:55:25.275 --> 00:55:33.179]  If you want to find out why the globalists are so afraid of us because we're exposing them, if you want to find out about the New World Order, get my preeminent film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.321]  Buy one copy of this 9-11 film.
[00:55:36.381 --> 00:55:38.642]  Each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:55:38.722 --> 00:55:40.863]  Buy one copy at the regular price, almost three hours.
[00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:43.004]  Each additional copy, $5.95.
[00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:47.927]  American Dictators, my newest film, documented in the stage selection of 2004, 1995.
[00:55:48.447 --> 00:55:49.928]  Each additional copy, $5.95.
[00:55:50.988 --> 00:55:53.410]  Get four or five copies, or get one copy and make copies.
[00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:53.890]  Whatever.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.383]  Or call toll-free to get any of my films.
[00:55:57.403 --> 00:55:58.024]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:58.044 --> 00:55:58.084]  888-253-3139.
[00:55:58.104 --> 00:55:59.686]  Bunch of different specials going right now.
[00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:03.751]  Just call, ask the operators about the different specials.
[00:56:03.771 --> 00:56:05.013]  No obligation to buy.
[00:56:13.904 --> 00:56:16.566]  They'll answer your questions.
[00:56:16.586 --> 00:56:17.066]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:21.509]  Or go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:21.529 --> 00:56:23.971]  Peruse the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:25.172]  Read about all the different specials.
[00:56:25.492 --> 00:56:28.574]  Watch free video clips of the films and order them right there if you'd like to.
[00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:31.096]  And then don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:31.856 --> 00:56:35.239]  You can watch all of my documentary films there online.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.842]  You can watch a bunch of other films we've posted there.
[00:56:41.323 --> 00:56:41.643]  Books.
[00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:46.150]  My best audio interviews, prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:47.550]  Back to Jimmy Walter.
[00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.311]  Jimmy, yeah, let's go over this for people.
[00:56:50.731 --> 00:56:58.012]  Now, we have the government on paper, admittedly, telling the firefighters, don't wear your respiration mask, it'll scare people.
[00:56:58.612 --> 00:56:59.452]  Cover this up.
[00:56:59.752 --> 00:57:01.773]  Then the EPA report's covering this up.
[00:57:02.173 --> 00:57:05.994]  I mean, we're talking about, those buildings were pulverized.
[00:57:06.294 --> 00:57:08.094]  Everybody saw those plumes of white dust.
[00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:13.714]  Debris covering much of downtown lower Manhattan.
[00:57:14.174 --> 00:57:15.095]  Break it down for us.
[00:57:16.676 --> 00:57:24.042]  The worst thing even than that, Alex, I've got to interject, is they're about to bring down the Deutsche Bank building down there.
[00:57:24.682 --> 00:57:26.524]  And it is full of this stuff.
[00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:27.364]  Still in there.
[00:57:28.325 --> 00:57:32.028]  And it's going to create a new poisonous cloud.
[00:57:32.588 --> 00:57:34.550]  And the EPA, which is now...
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:42.126]  Members in it now are refusing to acknowledge that there's a problem at all, saying that's a standard demolition.
[00:57:42.786 --> 00:58:00.780]  But this stuff that's in there is the same stuff that poisoned everybody else, and it has high levels of radioactive mercurium-241, hundreds of thousands of pounds of concentrations above normal in lead, mercury, etc., etc.,
[00:58:02.134 --> 00:58:08.459]  And it's so bad, just people who live in the area are still coming down with this thing called the WTC cough.
[00:58:09.099 --> 00:58:17.045]  It's a new medical diagnosis, yet the EPA and the New York City Health still maintain there's no problem.
[00:58:17.185 --> 00:58:20.528]  Have you seen the New Scientist article where they scan the lungs?
[00:58:21.428 --> 00:58:21.989]  No, I haven't.
[00:58:22.009 --> 00:58:24.851]  Yeah, they conclusively prove their lungs are full of this stuff.
[00:58:25.777 --> 00:58:27.618]  I'd like to... Send me that article, too, would you?
[00:58:28.159 --> 00:58:28.399]  Sure.
[00:58:28.499 --> 00:58:30.200]  I'll need to get your email.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.421]  It's obviously on the website.
[00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:32.602]  Well, we'll get together.
[00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:35.483]  But this stuff, this is the silver bullet.
[00:58:35.784 --> 00:58:36.824]  They can't dodge it.
[00:58:37.084 --> 00:58:40.347]  There are no hijackers, no Muslims, no Arabs involved here.
[00:58:40.607 --> 00:58:44.929]  Now, you know Al-Qaeda put the asbestos in all those buildings.
[00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:46.410]  Yeah.
[00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:50.053]  You know it's their fault, and if you or four of the firefighters are with Al-Qaeda...
[00:58:57.969 --> 00:58:58.609]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.330]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.150]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:03.670]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:05.270]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:09.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:14.252]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.173 --> 00:59:22.573]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now into hour number two on this 24th edition.
[00:59:22.914 --> 00:59:23.614]  This Monday, 2005.
[00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:28.110]  We're talking to Jimmy Walter.
[00:59:28.951 --> 00:59:38.499]  He ran full-page ads in major magazines and newspapers around the country, exposing the fact that Saddam didn't have any weapons of mass destruction and was against al-Qaeda, al-CIAIDA.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:46.726]  He then spent over $3 million running TV, radio, and print ads, exposing government complicity and prior knowledge in 9-11.
[00:59:47.467 --> 00:59:53.392]  And now he's helping fund lawsuits in New York for the firefighters and the citizens and the police.
[00:59:54.578 --> 01:00:03.963]  Again, major publications like the New Scientist have done studies, CT scans, CAT scans of the lungs.
[01:00:04.363 --> 01:00:07.485]  They're full of asbestos and mercury and concrete dust.
[01:00:08.265 --> 01:00:11.507]  And now they're going to blow up another one of the big buildings and demolish it down there.
[01:00:12.647 --> 01:00:14.688]  You saw the clouds, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:20.811]  And they told the firefighters, this is the government's own report, don't wear breathing apparatus the first few days because we don't want to scare people.
[01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:23.693]  And I can't believe some of them actually follow those orders.
[01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:29.260]  But we got on air and said, don't send your money to the Red Cross that steals it, which they were caught doing, of course.
[01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.561]  Send your money to these local charities.
[01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.102]  Mail them a respirator.
[01:00:33.443 --> 01:00:34.643]  Mail them masks.
[01:00:35.404 --> 01:00:36.164]  And we did that.
[01:00:36.184 --> 01:00:37.485]  Of course, that's because we're evil.
[01:00:38.646 --> 01:00:45.210]  If you truly support the police and military, you just don't really support them, and you just say you support the president.
[01:00:45.831 --> 01:00:47.211]  That's part of the new double thing.
[01:00:47.932 --> 01:00:49.453]  Jimmy Walter continuing with this.
[01:00:51.024 --> 01:00:51.725]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:00:52.626 --> 01:01:01.955]  But they can't dodge this health issue bullet because the real EPA inspectors, before they fired them all, had the results.
[01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:02.715]  They warned them.
[01:01:02.735 --> 01:01:06.940]  Dr. Kate Jenkins called the people up saying, you can't do this.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.303]  And it wasn't just for a couple of days afterwards, Alex.
[01:01:10.822 --> 01:01:13.404]  This stuff stayed in the air for months.
[01:01:13.584 --> 01:01:14.465]  Well, it's still there.
[01:01:14.725 --> 01:01:16.186]  It still smells weird there.
[01:01:16.486 --> 01:01:23.912]  Giant piles, just thousands of tons of all this garbage on top of buildings, in the streets, blowing around forever.
[01:01:24.572 --> 01:01:34.960]  Highly pulverized, super fine, so it floats and it lingers, and it's got radioactive isotopes in it, mercury in it, lead, asbestos, vanadium.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.542]  Who else knows what else is in those buildings?
[01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.936]  We're talking about masses of asbestos.
[01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:41.776]  Right.
[01:01:41.876 --> 01:01:58.224]  But really, the news item here is that the Deutsche Bank building has not yet been destroyed, and we really need to mount a campaign, especially the people in the neighborhood of New York City down there, because they're going to be poisoned again.
[01:02:00.046 --> 01:02:02.489]  Now, I don't have a map of the buildings in front of me.
[01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:06.953]  I know Banker's Trust is right next to the South Tower, and they're going to leave that.
[01:02:07.553 --> 01:02:09.675]  Which one is the Deutsche Bank?
[01:02:10.236 --> 01:02:17.223]  Well, I really don't have it on the map, but I can certainly get it for you in a few minutes, and I'll be working as we talk, in fact.
[01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:19.085]  That's another building full of all this stuff.
[01:02:19.345 --> 01:02:21.427]  Right, but if you go to our website...
[01:02:22.103 --> 01:02:24.505]  What would the proper procedure have been?
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:57.685]  Well, first of all, the proper procedure would be to seal the whole building from the outside, go in there with huge contained vacuum cleaners where the exhaust air is triple-triple filtered.
[01:02:58.045 --> 01:02:59.826]  This is what they do in asbestos removal.
[01:03:00.266 --> 01:03:03.827]  Well, I don't even know all the things, but this isn't just asbestos.
[01:03:04.207 --> 01:03:08.148]  Normally, asbestos is a fibrous-type thing that sucks up.
[01:03:08.788 --> 01:03:10.829]  This thing is super-fine powder.
[01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:15.147]  That's mixed up and reacted with all sorts of nasty stuff.
[01:03:16.908 --> 01:03:22.832]  And they knew about this, but then when it came time to give money to the people for their treatment, the government blocked that.
[01:03:23.953 --> 01:03:24.393]  Of course.
[01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:28.796]  Bush promises, promises, promises, leaves and never delivers.
[01:03:28.816 --> 01:03:30.216]  Unless it's a bomb, of course.
[01:03:31.617 --> 01:03:36.020]  The Deutsche Bank building is at 130 Liberty Street in lower Manhattan.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.621]  I'm reading off the thing now.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.961]  If you go to her site, you can find it easily.
[01:03:41.002 --> 01:03:42.823]  Yeah, Liberty Street's there on the south side.
[01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:43.423]  Right.
[01:03:43.643 --> 01:03:45.544]  So it's 130 Liberty Street.
[01:03:45.585 --> 01:03:47.606]  I'll be getting it for you on the thing.
[01:03:47.986 --> 01:03:49.107]  It's not far at all.
[01:03:49.127 --> 01:03:50.287]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:03:50.648 --> 01:03:51.148]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.452 --> 01:04:01.854]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:02.095 --> 01:04:06.836]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:12.718]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.978 --> 01:04:17.499]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:24.861]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.881 --> 01:04:29.423]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:32.083]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:32.323 --> 01:04:38.285]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitution.
[01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:39.266]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:39.346 --> 01:04:39.586]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:05:55.746 --> 01:06:03.072]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:07.815]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:06:08.076 --> 01:06:17.903]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.

[01:06:31.627 --> 01:06:33.188]  These days, that's just plain smart.

[01:06:48.397 --> 01:06:49.478]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:58.764]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.404 --> 01:07:00.385]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:02.248]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.908 --> 01:07:03.769]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.509 --> 01:07:05.470]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:09.713]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.233 --> 01:07:14.396]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.999 --> 01:07:20.460]  Alright, we'll go to your calls.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.101]  Mark and Ron and Jason and Eric and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:07:23.121 --> 01:07:23.902]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:24.723 --> 01:07:28.665]  Now on to the second segment of this January 24th, 2005 Monday edition.
[01:07:31.255 --> 01:07:51.989]  We're talking to Jimmy Walter, multi-millionaire Jimmy Walter, battles Bush administration, helps Ground Zero workers, sues feds for falsifying air quality reports, people are dying because the White House and Giuliani lied, New Ground Zero breaking news lawsuit accuses EPA of misleading public about levels of dangerous contaminants released in the air.
[01:07:52.489 --> 01:08:00.935]  After destruction of Twin Towers, plaintiffs said they were sent back to work without proper protective gear, which results in exposure to asbestos, PCBs,
[01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:02.036]  We're good to go.
[01:08:20.071 --> 01:08:23.956]  Now, I mean, asbestos is bad for you if it's all sealed up.
[01:08:24.116 --> 01:08:25.657]  Little microscopic amounts getting loose.
[01:08:26.078 --> 01:08:27.620]  Those buildings were pulverized.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:33.747]  You saw that white dust cover much of lower Manhattan and even blow across into the Bronx.
[01:08:35.228 --> 01:08:36.450]  Satellite photos of it.
[01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.133]  I mean, that stuff went over 60 miles.
[01:08:40.054 --> 01:08:40.995]  Just incredible.
[01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:47.077]  And Bush ordered the head of the EPA at the time to falsify the reports.
[01:08:47.117 --> 01:08:48.118]  That was in the news then.
[01:08:48.318 --> 01:08:51.699]  As I'll repeat again, the new scientists just came out with a report.
[01:08:51.759 --> 01:08:53.819]  They did scans of the lungs.
[01:08:53.939 --> 01:08:54.639]  They're scientists.
[01:08:54.719 --> 01:08:55.340]  They're doctors.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.300]  Of the firefighters and others.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:58.080]  Full.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.161]  I mean, just laden with this stuff.
[01:09:01.181 --> 01:09:02.562]  People dead and dying from it.
[01:09:03.522 --> 01:09:06.503]  I have United Press International here in front of me.
[01:09:06.523 --> 01:09:09.203]  Ground Zero cleanup crews developed the cough.
[01:09:09.583 --> 01:09:11.324]  The WTC cough.
[01:09:13.489 --> 01:09:19.033]  The workers who were there, the cleanup crews, all of it.
[01:09:19.553 --> 01:09:23.897]  And actually in my upcoming film, I spend a couple minutes on this and show all these news articles.
[01:09:24.537 --> 01:09:30.261]  So lately I've been back at it studying this one piece of the larger puzzle.
[01:09:30.742 --> 01:09:38.808]  But Jimmy makes the point that this is something, just like you go after Al Capone for income tax instead of murder, you get them on what you can get them for.
[01:09:39.628 --> 01:09:51.613]  But I want to just say to all the people out there listening, folks, it is an admitted fact that they knew what was happening, and they ordered the firefighters and others, don't wear breathing masks because this will scare the public.
[01:09:52.493 --> 01:09:53.414]  This is insane.
[01:09:53.574 --> 01:09:55.775]  This shows what the globalists really think of you.
[01:09:55.855 --> 01:09:57.655]  It's like depleted uranium in Iraq.
[01:09:58.136 --> 01:10:00.457]  They used three times as much this go-around as they did in 1991.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.084]  We've had the guy who wrote the book for the Pentagon, Dr. Doug Rodney, on many times.
[01:10:06.604 --> 01:10:09.467]  The Pentagon's own training manuals say, this will kill you.
[01:10:10.388 --> 01:10:11.249]  This is deadly.
[01:10:11.849 --> 01:10:17.314]  But they send our troops to live in bases that they bombed with it just days after they took over.
[01:10:18.075 --> 01:10:19.797]  So very, very serious.
[01:10:20.257 --> 01:10:26.363]  Jimmy, why do you think the elite just almost seem to love killing even their servants?
[01:10:28.227 --> 01:10:29.768]  Well, they've got lots of extras.
[01:10:31.409 --> 01:10:33.310]  They've got too many in their opinion.
[01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:39.434]  This guy, Maurice Strong, and other people are on record as saying, we've got too many people on earth.
[01:10:39.474 --> 01:10:40.874]  We need to get rid of some.
[01:10:41.415 --> 01:10:49.780]  He didn't say exactly that, but the point of the matter is they don't care as long as they make money off of it.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.841]  And that is the bottom line.
[01:10:51.861 --> 01:10:56.564]  If you follow the money, there's been lots and lots and lots of money made off of all of this
[01:10:57.054 --> 01:11:02.315]  And the insurance companies don't want to have to pay off on health hazards.
[01:11:04.475 --> 01:11:09.776]  So you have to understand that this thing, it continues.
[01:11:10.297 --> 01:11:15.238]  At the Pentagon, remember that one single hole that punched through the nine concrete walls?
[01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:19.998]  The reason it did that was because it was full of depleted uranium.
[01:11:20.299 --> 01:11:22.479]  Christopher Boleyn of the American Free Press
[01:11:25.011 --> 01:11:36.578]  And again, for those who just joined us, if you don't know what really happened at the Pentagon, you need to research it.
[01:11:36.778 --> 01:11:42.061]  Jimmy, what specifically are you doing in trying to fund these lawsuits?
[01:11:42.774 --> 01:11:44.935]  Well, I'm still looking for people who are doing it.
[01:11:44.955 --> 01:11:53.680]  There are already people who have lawsuits and I've talked to them but they're proceeding at their own pace.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.541]  So I'm advertising the facts.
[01:11:55.621 --> 01:12:07.727]  I'm putting legal opinions on the website and I've told anyone there who's interested to please contact me via email and tell me their story and we'll see what we can do.
[01:12:08.859 --> 01:12:19.404]  I'm looking for a good criminal attorney in New York City who knows how to get the prosecutor to actually act on this case because he's just sitting on it.
[01:12:19.484 --> 01:12:25.287]  My focus has been to stir up the criminal side as well as the civil suit side.
[01:12:25.327 --> 01:12:34.511]  In other words, by publishing the crimes that were committed here on my website and sending out... We're going to send out that free DVD I was talking to you about.
[01:12:34.831 --> 01:12:36.032]  We're going to send one out.
[01:12:36.428 --> 01:12:59.482]  To everyone in lower Manhattan, to 100,000 residents closest to the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, as well as to many of the professionals who work in Manhattan, to try to get them to understand what really happened and how they have been poisoned, and to get them to go down and file charges, criminal charges against all the people involved, because it's all documented.
[01:12:59.522 --> 01:13:01.043]  This is a no-brainer case.
[01:13:02.074 --> 01:13:06.636]  And again, Jimmy Walter, you've spent over $3 million exposing 9-11, correct?
[01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:09.317]  I'm over $3.5 million and still counting.
[01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:15.940]  And now you're going to mail 100,000 free 4-hour DVDs out to people in lower Manhattan?
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:16.841]  That's correct.
[01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:23.404]  Well, that's going to really stir it up, because then they're all going to go and start talking to other people.
[01:13:23.724 --> 01:13:24.864]  They're going to show it to folks.
[01:13:24.904 --> 01:13:27.005]  They're going to go file criminal charges.
[01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:28.406]  Remember my story?
[01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:30.467]  I didn't believe it until I saw the video.
[01:13:31.835 --> 01:13:33.676]  And then I'm going around doing print ads.
[01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:34.856]  Duh, Jimmy.
[01:13:37.277 --> 01:13:43.619]  This is cheaper than all of the video ads I ran during the election in New York City.
[01:13:43.639 --> 01:13:48.960]  It would be cheaper to send them a DVD free by about 25% cheaper.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.881]  25% of the total cost just to send the DVD.
[01:13:52.301 --> 01:13:54.382]  You can't get better bang for your buck than that.
[01:13:55.109 --> 01:13:56.490]  Well, you're doing an incredible thing.
[01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:57.551]  Let's take some calls.
[01:13:58.052 --> 01:13:59.193]  They're sure to be all over the map.
[01:13:59.213 --> 01:14:00.134]  They've been holding forever.
[01:14:00.654 --> 01:14:01.915]  Mark and Jason just hung up.
[01:14:01.955 --> 01:14:02.676]  I was about to go to them.
[01:14:02.716 --> 01:14:05.698]  Let's go to Ron in Michigan.
[01:14:05.779 --> 01:14:06.619]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:14:06.679 --> 01:14:07.100]  Go ahead.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:12.544]  I had a question about the gentleman, the reporter who you're talking about in the Washington Times.
[01:14:12.585 --> 01:14:14.146]  They're talking about executing him.
[01:14:15.187 --> 01:14:16.148]  Yes.
[01:14:16.268 --> 01:14:20.532]  This reminds me of what is stated in the Patriot Act, how all news gathering is now illegal.
[01:14:20.632 --> 01:14:21.913]  So do you think that he's...
[01:14:22.552 --> 01:14:23.792]  Just a good guy to start with?
[01:14:24.373 --> 01:14:29.755]  Well, that's in Patriot Act II, that all news gathering can be considered an intelligence operation.
[01:14:29.795 --> 01:14:31.695]  And they actually list the law they want to use.
[01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:38.638]  It's the sedition laws from 1918 is the particular law that they use here.
[01:14:38.658 --> 01:14:44.980]  And they're talking about Cy Hearst, who exposed the fact that our government is already doing operations in Iran.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.721]  Well, that's been in the foreign news.
[01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:50.682]  For a year plus, they've been bombing and strafing and
[01:14:51.678 --> 01:14:52.960]  He needs to be executed.
[01:15:08.479 --> 01:15:11.940]  Do you think if that happens, this is the first of many to come, if they actually execute him?
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.320]  Well, it's not going to happen.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.121]  The point is, this is what they'd like to do.
[01:15:15.481 --> 01:15:17.001]  This is because we're hurting them.
[01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:18.302]  We're exposing them.
[01:15:18.522 --> 01:15:20.742]  They're trying to introduce the idea of torture.
[01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:23.403]  Introduce the idea of arresting people.
[01:15:24.323 --> 01:15:34.666]  The Deputy Attorney General of California, two years ago, Mr. Calhoun, was in the major newspaper there in Oakland, the Oakland Tribune, saying,
[01:15:35.206 --> 01:15:43.234]  We may just ban anti-war protests, because anti-war protests aid terrorists, because fighting the war aids terrorists.
[01:15:43.294 --> 01:15:44.675]  We may arrest you.
[01:15:44.695 --> 01:15:46.116]  Of course, they didn't do that.
[01:15:46.377 --> 01:15:47.658]  It's a chilling effect.
[01:15:48.018 --> 01:15:50.581]  And that's a Democrat doing this, by the way, folks.
[01:15:51.181 --> 01:15:52.302]  It's not left or right.
[01:15:52.362 --> 01:15:53.363]  It's about the globalists.
[01:15:53.904 --> 01:15:55.005]  Jimmy Walters comments.
[01:15:55.862 --> 01:16:14.726]  Well, first of all, I want to say that I was at a progressive Democratic meeting the other day, and Arianna Huffington got up and said, the reason we lost the election was we didn't have a good enough message, and we played to the independents rather than anyone else.
[01:16:15.246 --> 01:16:17.647]  She did not even mention the election fraud.
[01:16:18.126 --> 01:16:20.109]  The Democrats are in on it, in my opinion.
[01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:21.731]  Kerry gave up without a fight.
[01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:26.037]  Well, yeah, you can't just rig the election unless the candidates are rigged.
[01:16:26.217 --> 01:16:27.719]  Right, and the same thing before.
[01:16:27.759 --> 01:16:31.484]  Gore gave up without a fight.
[01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:33.286]  I'm set up with them.
[01:16:33.306 --> 01:16:35.429]  They're certainly not fighting for us.
[01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:41.591]  As far as I'm concerned, it's Corporate Party A or Corporate Party B, as Dave Von Kleist likes to call it.
[01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:42.251]  Well, it is.
[01:16:42.332 --> 01:16:47.053]  And for listeners out there who think they're conservative, folks, George Bush is not conservative.
[01:16:47.153 --> 01:16:52.074]  Governing the growth rate of government, open borders, gun control, signing on to UNESCO deals.
[01:16:52.394 --> 01:16:53.214]  You know, I'm sick of it.
[01:16:53.254 --> 01:16:56.175]  But let me just go over this since the caller mentioned it.
[01:16:56.235 --> 01:16:58.015]  Well, caller, do you want me to read some of this?
[01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:01.316]  Is Ron still there?
[01:17:02.927 --> 01:17:03.367]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:17:03.528 --> 01:17:04.468]  I'm here.
[01:17:04.609 --> 01:17:05.489]  Ron, right here.
[01:17:05.509 --> 01:17:10.093]  Now, this is an article out of the New American that links over to the Washington Times article.
[01:17:10.113 --> 01:17:11.314]  I have both of them in front of me.
[01:17:11.755 --> 01:17:14.637]  Headline, should anti-Bush journalists be tried as spies?
[01:17:15.678 --> 01:17:21.644]  According to the Washington Times editorial page, Tony Blakely, investigative reporter, Seymour Hersh, should be tried for espionage.
[01:17:22.124 --> 01:17:25.587]  Tony Blakely, editorial page editor of the Washington Times, is a walking museum.
[01:17:26.328 --> 01:17:29.571]  His syndicated column, regularly...
[01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:43.279]  Retail Soviet-style myths, the majesty of the state and its dear leader, thoughtfully published in pedestrian English prose so as to avoid the necessity of translation.
[01:17:44.261 --> 01:17:58.095]  In his most recent offering, Commissar Blakely opines the investigative reporter Seymour Hersh committed espionage by publishing a detailed expose of the Bush administration's plans and preparations for war with Iran.
[01:17:58.616 --> 01:18:03.601]  According to Hersh, the administration has been conducting pre-war covert operations inside Iran.
[01:18:03.901 --> 01:18:07.485]  Those operations allegedly are being carried out to the Pentagon rather than the CIA.
[01:18:07.905 --> 01:18:09.005]  So does that answer your question, Ron?
[01:18:09.105 --> 01:18:10.105]  Yes, it does.
[01:18:38.274 --> 01:18:39.475]  Who was the author of that?
[01:18:40.156 --> 01:18:44.739]  That was Tony Blakely, the former minion of Newt Gingrich.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:45.840]  Tony?
[01:18:46.441 --> 01:18:46.801]  Tony.
[01:18:48.062 --> 01:18:48.743]  All right, thank you.
[01:18:49.223 --> 01:18:50.925]  Yeah, stay there, Jimmy.
[01:18:50.945 --> 01:18:52.086]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[01:18:53.627 --> 01:18:57.830]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:18:58.591 --> 01:18:59.832]  In business and socially,
[01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:06.853]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:19:07.434 --> 01:19:09.174]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:15.858]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:19:16.478 --> 01:19:18.039]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:19:18.579 --> 01:19:20.740]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:23.362]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:19:23.922 --> 01:19:25.003]  And it's so easy.
[01:19:25.723 --> 01:19:27.704]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:19:28.559 --> 01:19:29.199]  When you want.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.340]  Where you want.

[01:19:40.185 --> 01:19:40.585]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:19:53.647 --> 01:19:57.550]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:10.060]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:10.880]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.525]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.905 --> 01:20:19.127]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.928 --> 01:20:21.448]  We're good to go.
[01:20:41.798 --> 01:20:41.999]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:20:53.246 --> 01:20:55.768]  Hey, gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.

[01:22:58.382 --> 01:23:00.283]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.763 --> 01:23:03.605]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.625 --> 01:23:06.366]  Yeah, I'm going to get more into this later.
[01:23:06.386 --> 01:23:13.470]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on Yesterday's News, there's a calendar right there.
[01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.730]  Click on the 23rd.
[01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:17.672]  It's the top story on the left-hand side.
[01:23:19.315 --> 01:23:22.117]  And should anti-Bush journalists be tried as spies?
[01:23:22.177 --> 01:23:23.918]  The New American wrote an article about it.
[01:23:24.178 --> 01:23:32.702]  Then you can link through and read the actual article by the chief of staff for Newt Gingrich, his former chief of staff.
[01:23:34.563 --> 01:23:37.085]  And he's one of the chiefs now at the Washington Times.
[01:23:38.365 --> 01:23:46.390]  He says, "...federal prosecutors should review the information disclosed by Mr. Hersh to determine whether or not his conduct falls in the prescribed conduct of the state."
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:53.723]  If found guilty, the accused faces death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life.
[01:23:54.423 --> 01:24:01.026]  Found guilty of treasonous activities by releasing information about the state.
[01:24:01.786 --> 01:24:04.067]  Simply talking about what's all over the foreign news.
[01:24:05.148 --> 01:24:06.168]  It's all over the place.
[01:24:07.429 --> 01:24:12.511]  Everybody who's informed knows troops have been in Iran, troops have been in Syria for a long time.
[01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:16.087]  I mean, they've been all over the news saying they want to go ahead and invade them.
[01:24:16.567 --> 01:24:17.227]  Jimmy Walter?
[01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:21.948]  Well, I was just reading the article online as you were talking, Alex.
[01:24:22.008 --> 01:24:26.110]  First of all, it says, in time of war.
[01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:29.691]  Well, the United States Congress has not declared war.
[01:24:30.071 --> 01:24:33.091]  So the statute doesn't apply.
[01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:39.153]  Also, this means somebody like Benedict Arnold in a battle going and selling out to the enemy.
[01:24:39.193 --> 01:24:41.294]  It doesn't mean writing a news report.
[01:24:41.354 --> 01:24:42.394]  We have the First Amendment.
[01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:46.535]  He didn't tell them where to find them.
[01:24:46.936 --> 01:24:51.660]  They are SEAL teams and it's not like they're not looking for them anyway.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.722]  This is not really news if you want to know it.
[01:24:54.122 --> 01:25:00.728]  I mean, if you're in an Iranian government and you don't think the United States military has been penetrating you with SEAL and commando teams...
[01:25:01.218 --> 01:25:03.740]  You deserve to go down to the loony bin yourself.
[01:25:04.121 --> 01:25:05.081]  Of course they're doing it.
[01:25:05.442 --> 01:25:11.507]  But the fact of the matter is that he's bringing this up, as you said something earlier, to scare people from doing something.
[01:25:11.547 --> 01:25:20.234]  I don't notice him bringing up the United States Code about Colin Powell lying about what happened, which would be the same thing here.
[01:25:20.514 --> 01:25:24.418]  Colin Powell gets up there in front of the UN and gives false information.
[01:25:30.998 --> 01:25:36.822]  Listen, I'm no fan of Barbara Boxer, but she got up there a few weeks ago and just said, look, here are your quotes.
[01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:38.523]  You say weapons of mass destruction.
[01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:42.026]  You say that you never heard of plans to fly planes into buildings.
[01:25:42.426 --> 01:25:45.448]  Here's all the actual documents that you have that you signed off on.
[01:25:45.788 --> 01:25:46.709]  You didn't tell the truth.
[01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:49.050]  And she's like, how dare you say that?
[01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:52.032]  How dare you say the sun came up this morning?
[01:25:52.393 --> 01:25:52.613]  Right.
[01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:57.418]  Well, it's that indignant anger that everybody says, oh, well, they're indignantly angered.
[01:25:57.758 --> 01:25:58.579]  They must be right.
[01:25:58.699 --> 01:26:00.201]  But, malarkey, these people are...
[01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:01.896]  Best actors.
[01:26:02.197 --> 01:26:04.257]  Well, remember Rumsfeld on Face the Nation?
[01:26:04.538 --> 01:26:07.299]  Going, how dare you say I said he had weapons of mass destruction?
[01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:08.279]  I never said that.
[01:26:08.339 --> 01:26:09.119]  It's an urban legend.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.460]  So they started playing clips of him saying it.
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:11.701]  Right.
[01:26:11.801 --> 01:26:12.281]  I know.
[01:26:12.641 --> 01:26:14.422]  I mean, these people are nuts, folks.
[01:26:14.442 --> 01:26:18.663]  They just think that... You know how they tell a lie and their lips are moving all the time.
[01:26:18.863 --> 01:26:21.905]  Well, you know, I have a quote here by a White House official of the New York Times.
[01:26:22.445 --> 01:26:24.606]  In fact, I want to dig it out later and read it, where he says...
[01:26:25.226 --> 01:26:27.067]  We actually make reality now.
[01:26:27.367 --> 01:26:30.249]  Because we are the world superpower and the world empire.
[01:26:30.549 --> 01:26:32.610]  It doesn't matter what's real to you.
[01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:34.571]  We make what's reality.
[01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:36.031]  We are the supreme leaders.
[01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:42.875]  I mean, this is getting Napoleonic, Hitlerite cuckoo where the leaders actually go crazy.
[01:26:42.895 --> 01:26:45.436]  Did you read the inaugural address, Alex?
[01:26:47.117 --> 01:26:48.558]  The guy is crazy.
[01:26:48.598 --> 01:26:50.519]  He started raving mad.
[01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:52.960]  And then came a day of fire.
[01:26:53.815 --> 01:27:00.218]  And then the last phrase, I forget what it was, about we shall never give up, onward and to every country across.
[01:27:00.238 --> 01:27:03.479]  The girl is stark raving mad.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.361]  No, he's gone over the fruitcake line.
[01:27:08.381 --> 01:27:10.002]  He's crossed the Rubicon.
[01:27:10.042 --> 01:27:14.064]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Pennsylvania.
[01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:14.824]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.926]  While you're on the issue of 9-11, there's one thing...
[01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:36.512]  It's not really related to the dust or anything, but I just want to say that one big thing about 9-11 that was just figured out sort of recently was this thing about a power down on the weekend before where engineers were walking in and out of the towers.
[01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:41.797]  They had whole floors shut down in 7 and Tower 1 and 2.
[01:27:41.977 --> 01:27:44.140]  What better time to put demolition charges in?
[01:27:44.744 --> 01:27:46.625]  What better time to put demolition charges in?
[01:27:46.665 --> 01:27:53.728]  Witnesses saw work crews during the evacuations, they had three evacuations, doing things with the columns.
[01:27:55.289 --> 01:27:57.170]  Now, I have two questions.
[01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:59.951]  These aren't 9-11, but these are sort of important.
[01:27:59.971 --> 01:28:08.215]  Now, the problem with trying to get the truth out is a lot of people, including my family, they think that I'm completely ridiculous and nuts.
[01:28:08.755 --> 01:28:13.117]  Now, my question is for them and other people to hear this.
[01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:17.369]  How exactly do you know all this stuff to be true?
[01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:28.478]  Well, because I spent my life studying it, and this is what I do, and I understand the global plan, so I know what the New World Order is up to, and I read their own documents.
[01:28:28.918 --> 01:28:29.138]  All right.
[01:28:29.198 --> 01:28:32.300]  Now, the last question, this comes from my brother.
[01:28:32.321 --> 01:28:37.825]  He says, what's the point of knowing if they're just going to do this stuff?
[01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.545]  You know, stay there.
[01:28:39.086 --> 01:28:39.986]  I'll answer the questions.
[01:28:40.026 --> 01:28:41.828]  Let Jimmy chime in on this on the other side.
[01:28:44.065 --> 01:28:44.947]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.469 --> 01:28:47.072]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.974 --> 01:28:50.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.647 --> 01:29:01.894]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:29:02.155 --> 01:29:06.518]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:29:06.819 --> 01:29:15.727]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:29:15.927 --> 01:29:19.550]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:24.859]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:31.911]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:29:32.391 --> 01:29:32.932]  What about you?
[01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:39.032]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:29:39.072 --> 01:29:40.173]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:29:40.253 --> 01:29:42.154]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:29:55.589 --> 01:30:01.074]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:01.514 --> 01:30:05.737]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:30:05.978 --> 01:30:13.003]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:13.384 --> 01:30:19.509]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:19.649 --> 01:30:20.850]  There are no side effects.
[01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.511]  We're good to go.
[01:30:37.953 --> 01:30:41.116]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:30:41.136 --> 01:30:41.176]  866-885-6625.
[01:30:41.196 --> 01:30:41.276]  866-885-6625.
[01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:42.397]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:30:42.417 --> 01:30:42.617]  Call today.
[01:30:54.039 --> 01:30:55.560]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.001]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:30:58.362 --> 01:30:59.242]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:30:59.602 --> 01:31:00.823]  Oil War III has started.
[01:31:01.143 --> 01:31:03.565]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:31:03.985 --> 01:31:07.367]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:31:07.807 --> 01:31:11.629]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:13.150]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:31:13.611 --> 01:31:18.073]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:22.496]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:31:23.016 --> 01:31:28.918]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:31:29.178 --> 01:31:35.260]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:31:35.781 --> 01:31:36.121]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:42.043]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:31:42.483 --> 01:31:42.703]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:42.723 --> 01:31:45.084]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:31:45.104 --> 01:31:45.504]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:31:56.705 --> 01:32:05.292]  We're going to roll through a few more calls from Eric and Ed and Ross and John.
[01:32:05.312 --> 01:32:06.453]  That'll be it for this hour.
[01:32:06.473 --> 01:32:09.375]  After we take those calls for our great guest, Jimmy Walter.
[01:32:10.236 --> 01:32:14.479]  We'll go to Jimmy here in a few minutes, then I want to try to answer Eric's question.
[01:32:14.499 --> 01:32:15.480]  But before we do that...
[01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:25.196]  I suggest for your friends and family, Eric, the friends and family that are laughing at you, that you get a copy of my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:32:26.057 --> 01:32:28.719]  We show Nero burn Rome to blame it on the Christians.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:42.408]  We show, it's now admitted, that the Maine was blown up in 1898 by William McKinley's Navy to blame it on the Spanish to then get the Philippines and other areas.
[01:32:43.169 --> 01:32:44.330]  We then show...
[01:32:45.396 --> 01:32:46.257]  World War II.
[01:32:46.337 --> 01:32:51.720]  It's now admitted they had prior knowledge and tied the ships all up in a line so the Japanese could attack.
[01:32:52.401 --> 01:32:54.082]  So help that sneak attack along.
[01:32:54.762 --> 01:32:56.043]  Then we have the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:57.724]  Never happened.
[01:32:57.744 --> 01:33:01.427]  We get into Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[01:33:01.467 --> 01:33:03.328]  government plan to carry out 9-11.
[01:33:03.729 --> 01:33:10.013]  Hijack jets by remote control, crash them, bomb D.C., commit sniper attacks, blame it on...
[01:33:10.822 --> 01:33:11.482]  Foreign enemies.
[01:33:11.963 --> 01:33:13.183]  You can tell your dad, Dad.
[01:33:13.203 --> 01:33:16.225]  I mean, I'm not a betting man, but tell him to put his money where his mouth is.
[01:33:17.065 --> 01:33:17.385]  Dad?
[01:33:18.766 --> 01:33:19.447]  Wager me $10,000.
[01:33:21.368 --> 01:33:26.530]  If you want to laugh at me that Operation Northwoods doesn't exist, then it wasn't the official U.S.
[01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:28.731]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:33:31.733 --> 01:33:33.814]  But again, that type of stuff is in 9-11 law.
[01:33:36.081 --> 01:33:36.961]  The road to tyranny.
[01:33:37.001 --> 01:33:41.282]  Then we get into the World Trade Center, where the FBI admits they cooked the bomb, trained the driver in 93.
[01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:45.123]  Oklahoma City admitted government bombing.
[01:33:45.143 --> 01:33:45.543]  9-11.
[01:33:46.363 --> 01:33:50.924]  We go through all the evidence, then show you the police state being shut up.
[01:33:50.944 --> 01:33:57.126]  I mean, give your father Police State 2000 that I made over four years ago.
[01:33:58.746 --> 01:33:59.026]  And it's...
[01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:02.893]  Even more, quote, entertaining or riveting or scary today.
[01:34:03.253 --> 01:34:06.675]  Everything I claimed was going to happen in that film is now mainstream news.
[01:34:07.736 --> 01:34:09.618]  Because I go off the federal plans.
[01:34:09.658 --> 01:34:12.740]  The globalists know most people aren't out reading federal documents.
[01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:15.002]  There's different tiers of information.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.962]  So get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:34:18.042 --> 01:34:19.824]  Get Masters of Terror, Part 2 of that.
[01:34:20.545 --> 01:34:22.307]  Get Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[01:34:22.347 --> 01:34:34.502]  Get Matrix of Evil, where you'll see Congressman Ron Paul talk about people that want world government run the Congress and the White House and how we're going to have a depression and how it's a one world government.
[01:34:35.313 --> 01:34:36.334]  Get the videos.
[01:34:36.514 --> 01:34:40.698]  Give them to your friends and family because it will show the documents, the news, the facts.
[01:34:41.219 --> 01:34:42.300]  Call toll-free.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.842]  Big discounts running right now on these films.

[01:34:49.308 --> 01:34:51.789]  It supports us, but they're also great films.

[01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:37.861]  Get them.
[01:35:37.921 --> 01:35:38.821]  Get them out to people.
[01:35:39.081 --> 01:35:43.382]  Or give your friends and family a membership to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:43.402 --> 01:35:46.643]  $5.95 a month or even less for a year per month.
[01:35:47.944 --> 01:35:48.264]  All right.
[01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:54.733]  Going back to Jimmy Walter, to answer your question, Eric, this is important.
[01:35:55.933 --> 01:35:58.834]  You ask, you know, they say, well how do you know?
[01:35:58.874 --> 01:35:59.755]  Well how do they know?
[01:36:00.355 --> 01:36:02.136]  I have friends and family that make $200,000 a year.
[01:36:04.597 --> 01:36:12.120]  They can tell you all the baseball scores and all the football scores for the past 20 years, but they cannot find Iraq on a map.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:16.301]  They do not know who the Macedonian world conqueror was.
[01:36:16.781 --> 01:36:22.323]  They do not know where Adolf Hitler came to power, how he came to power.
[01:36:22.904 --> 01:36:28.506]  They don't know about what an oligarchy is versus a plutocracy versus a republic.
[01:36:29.726 --> 01:36:32.007]  And they're shocked when you talk to them
[01:36:32.791 --> 01:36:37.996]  If you're out to dinner with these people, and they're intelligent, but they're not focused on this.
[01:36:38.037 --> 01:36:39.578]  It's like you're speaking another language.
[01:36:40.119 --> 01:36:42.761]  When you talk to them, they think you're showing off.
[01:36:44.183 --> 01:36:49.568]  Because you're involved in the real world, and in world politics, and in what's really interesting.
[01:36:49.869 --> 01:36:52.812]  What the real game is that all the elite play.
[01:36:53.952 --> 01:36:56.533]  And so, I mean, I've had debates with professors.
[01:36:57.454 --> 01:36:59.295]  And I'm not that smart, folks, but I study this.
[01:36:59.335 --> 01:37:00.175]  I'm really into it.
[01:37:00.475 --> 01:37:01.796]  I have a passion for it.
[01:37:02.076 --> 01:37:03.857]  That's why I'm able to learn so much about it.
[01:37:04.677 --> 01:37:05.738]  I talk to professors.
[01:37:06.038 --> 01:37:13.322]  I talk to professors of anthropology that don't know as much about anthropology as I know, because I read books about anthropology.
[01:37:13.702 --> 01:37:15.082]  To them, it's just a job.
[01:37:15.823 --> 01:37:18.584]  They, you know, are out playing racquetball all day.
[01:37:18.644 --> 01:37:20.125]  It's about learning the minimum.
[01:37:20.859 --> 01:37:26.606]  And so your family laughs at you because you know about government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:35.557]  On September 10th, there was an AP article where the Pentagon put out a report and said, we don't need to send troops to
[01:37:36.463 --> 01:37:41.504]  To Palestine, because the Israelis are apt to kill them and blame it on the Palestinians.
[01:37:41.544 --> 01:37:42.565]  They're experts at this.
[01:37:42.945 --> 01:37:47.386]  You know, there's a Pentagon report saying this, and I'm not saying the Israelis were behind 9-11.
[01:37:47.626 --> 01:37:48.806]  I'm just using that as an example.
[01:37:50.266 --> 01:38:01.529]  London Guardian, they caught the German government with MI6 creating Nazi groups in Germany in the 60s as an excuse to take the general public's free speech.
[01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:05.010]  Okay, does this answer your question, Eric?
[01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:06.381]  Yeah.
[01:38:06.962 --> 01:38:08.103]  Okay, I've been ranting forever.
[01:38:08.603 --> 01:38:09.684]  Jimmy Walter comments?
[01:38:11.505 --> 01:38:16.209]  The point is that the people out there are not aware.
[01:38:16.269 --> 01:38:18.291]  This is a joke, since you brought this up.
[01:38:19.312 --> 01:38:24.196]  Alexander the Great, Napoleon, and Attila the Hun are looking down on modern times.
[01:38:25.257 --> 01:38:29.801]  Alexander says, if I'd only had machine guns, I could have conquered all of India.
[01:38:30.921 --> 01:38:34.905]  Attila says, if I'd only had tanks, I could have conquered all of Europe and Africa.
[01:38:36.099 --> 01:38:41.181]  Napoleon says, hmm, if I'd only had the Fox News, no one would have known I lost in Russia.
[01:38:44.543 --> 01:38:45.643]  So that's what we're up against.
[01:38:46.084 --> 01:38:48.105]  The media is the problem.
[01:38:48.585 --> 01:39:01.050]  Even now, the election fraud never even surfaced nationwide and was up and out as some sort of unpolite sideshow by the Democrats.
[01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:02.351]  And that poor Barbara Boxer
[01:39:02.808 --> 01:39:07.851]  Is the only woman, only person, who stood up on the election front.
[01:39:07.871 --> 01:39:11.133]  And I think, whatever her other faults, she should be applauded on this.
[01:39:11.473 --> 01:39:13.714]  And again, folks, I'm not a Democrat.
[01:39:13.774 --> 01:39:14.815]  I'm not a Republican.
[01:39:15.255 --> 01:39:16.776]  I'm known more as a conservative.
[01:39:17.396 --> 01:39:19.177]  That's the stance I actually take.
[01:39:19.237 --> 01:39:20.238]  It's not rhetoric.
[01:39:21.058 --> 01:39:21.939]  And it's true.
[01:39:22.737 --> 01:39:23.879]  Kerry won Ohio.
[01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:25.061]  He won New Mexico.
[01:39:25.803 --> 01:39:27.466]  Mr. Blackwell stole the election.
[01:39:27.486 --> 01:39:30.371]  They didn't count 400,000 challenged ballots.
[01:39:30.972 --> 01:39:32.174]  And there was no discussion.
[01:39:32.234 --> 01:39:33.597]  Kerry didn't say a word about it.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:42.106]  No discussion, but look, look, then your family will say, well, I watched this film, and it's all mainstream news and bills and documents.
[01:39:42.587 --> 01:39:58.682]  Yeah, it's the back of the news wire that the CIA was running drills of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon at 8.30 in the morning, and what they don't tell you in that article is we broke that story here, and they tried to get out ahead of it after we did and take control of it and spin it.
[01:39:59.404 --> 01:40:01.866]  So your family says, well, you know, this is in the news.
[01:40:02.206 --> 01:40:02.406]  No.
[01:40:02.966 --> 01:40:05.508]  There are lots of good AP and Reuters reporters.
[01:40:06.448 --> 01:40:12.272]  I've had them tell me, oh man, this story's true, I want to report it, I have all the facts, but they won't let me run it.
[01:40:12.572 --> 01:40:15.654]  Or if they do run it, no newspaper picks it up.
[01:40:15.734 --> 01:40:18.356]  See, we go get the stuff you never heard about.
[01:40:18.576 --> 01:40:24.680]  Or we go get the PNAC documents where Dick Cheney says, we need to have terror attacks to get the people behind our war.
[01:40:25.635 --> 01:40:39.367]  You know, we go read Brzezinski's book, The Grand Chessboard, where he says to have a world empire and to keep control of the slaves, he calls us slaves, we've got to have a helpful Pearl Harbor event for imperial mobilization.
[01:40:39.607 --> 01:40:44.912]  They said, we're going to have terror attacks, and you're going to be our slaves, and we're going to use you to invade the world.
[01:40:45.212 --> 01:40:48.175]  That's what a Napoleon or a Hitler does.
[01:40:48.235 --> 01:40:52.439]  They grab control of a country and then use it as an engine of empire, Jimmy.
[01:40:54.296 --> 01:41:00.999]  The fact of the matter is that the whole 9-11 was a masterful psychological attack.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:14.905]  The two planes that hit downtown took off at the same time, but they hit just enough distance in time between them so the news trucks could sit there and set up, just like the dadgum movie.
[01:41:15.698 --> 01:41:17.360]  And then the next attack.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.443]  So it's like being in a boxing ring.
[01:41:19.503 --> 01:41:21.025]  First they hit you in the head with one.
[01:41:21.205 --> 01:41:22.987]  Then you're getting a little back.
[01:41:23.027 --> 01:41:23.748]  They hit you again.
[01:41:23.768 --> 01:41:24.429]  You get a little back.
[01:41:24.469 --> 01:41:25.009]  They hit you again.
[01:41:25.029 --> 01:41:26.311]  Finally, you don't know which way is up.
[01:41:26.331 --> 01:41:32.138]  And you start believing whatever they tell you because these are the authorities and we're under attack.
[01:41:33.138 --> 01:41:37.262]  So, the whole thing has been a tremendous psychological exercise.
[01:41:37.562 --> 01:41:43.807]  The reason they used dynamite on the World Trade Towers is because they knew merely hitting them wouldn't be enough of a shock.
[01:41:44.188 --> 01:41:45.349]  They had to collapse.
[01:41:45.429 --> 01:41:50.553]  They had to get everybody watching and then see these symbols of American power collapse.
[01:41:50.733 --> 01:41:54.817]  It's just like that movie with Washington...
[01:41:55.437 --> 01:41:57.939]  And or the one with Dustin Hoffman.
[01:41:57.999 --> 01:42:01.562]  Both of the movies, the tail is wagging the dog here.
[01:42:01.822 --> 01:42:02.703]  Yeah, stop right there.
[01:42:02.743 --> 01:42:13.832]  In fact, since you mentioned that, I know we have the clip from A Long Kiss Goodnight, or just type into the search engine, The Long Kiss, and I'm talking to the board op right now, the great, really a producer, he does so much work.
[01:42:14.272 --> 01:42:16.214]  Type in The Long Kiss Goodnight.
[01:42:16.917 --> 01:42:19.118]  PrisonPlanet.com into Google.
[01:42:19.558 --> 01:42:20.698]  The page will pop up.
[01:42:20.998 --> 01:42:25.880]  A 1997 movie where they've got him chained down at the bottom of the World Trade Center.
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.901]  And they say, we're going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[01:42:29.941 --> 01:42:32.762]  We tried to do it in 93, but it didn't come down.
[01:42:33.122 --> 01:42:36.043]  So now we're going to blow it up for martial law and weapons funding.
[01:42:36.927 --> 01:42:40.349]  I mean, it's in movies, and the movie mentions the real thing that happened.
[01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:44.973]  Did you know I talked to the Lone Gunman slash X-Files star, Jimmy?
[01:42:45.693 --> 01:42:47.334]  It's also in the PNAC document.
[01:42:47.354 --> 01:42:49.095]  How much more clear can you be?
[01:42:49.115 --> 01:42:50.816]  We need a Pearl Harbor type event.
[01:42:51.057 --> 01:42:56.460]  Well, listen, at my door shows up Dean Haglund a month ago, you know, the star of the X-Files and Lone Gunman.
[01:42:56.901 --> 01:42:59.943]  And he says, Alex, I think the CIA planted that.
[01:42:59.963 --> 01:43:03.145]  He goes, I know they were planting stuff on us, planting scripts.
[01:43:03.625 --> 01:43:06.507]  And when I talked to the writers, they said, yeah, we think this was planted on us.
[01:43:07.467 --> 01:43:17.430]  Six months before they shoot it, three months before it airs, where the government says, we're hijacking a jet to fly to the World Trade Center to declare martial law and invade Afghanistan.
[01:43:20.071 --> 01:43:23.471]  So, Jimmy, the question is, why do they throw it in our face on top of it?
[01:43:24.032 --> 01:43:27.733]  Because they are contempt, nothing but utter contempt for us.
[01:43:27.813 --> 01:43:28.873]  They're laughing at us.
[01:43:29.253 --> 01:43:32.954]  They're saying, we don't care, you can't figure it out, and if you do, you can't do doodly squat.
[01:43:33.502 --> 01:43:35.483]  Tell you what, here's that clip from the Long Kiss Goodnight.
[01:43:35.503 --> 01:43:37.864]  We'll get a final comment from Eric and speed through these calls.
[01:43:38.084 --> 01:43:40.164]  Here's the Long Kiss Goodnight.
[01:43:40.545 --> 01:43:41.185]  Here it is, folks.
[01:43:42.045 --> 01:43:44.646]  Fundraiser?
[01:43:44.666 --> 01:43:44.646]  1993.
[01:43:46.127 --> 01:43:47.647]  World Trade Center bombing.
[01:43:47.807 --> 01:43:48.207]  Remember?
[01:43:50.548 --> 01:43:54.470]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[01:43:57.891 --> 01:44:00.392]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[01:44:01.756 --> 01:44:04.797]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing.
[01:44:05.157 --> 01:44:07.138]  Apparently to justify a budget increase.
[01:44:07.638 --> 01:44:12.180]  You're telling me that you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to get some money out of Congress?
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:16.442]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessy, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[01:44:17.943 --> 01:44:19.563]  So we're just going to have to do it for real.
[01:44:20.444 --> 01:44:24.045]  Don't blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
[01:44:24.165 --> 01:44:25.246]  Then I get my funding.
[01:44:26.486 --> 01:44:27.187]  Good night, old girl.
[01:44:28.287 --> 01:44:30.608]  Tennessee, I'll be in shop for one night.
[01:44:36.559 --> 01:44:37.980]  And, you know, we can't just stop there.
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:41.343]  I know we've got about ten clips, but find the specific one on my website.
[01:44:41.363 --> 01:44:42.804]  You've actually got it in the computer.
[01:44:43.364 --> 01:44:46.787]  Grab the one in the computer from the lone gunman where he explains.
[01:44:46.867 --> 01:44:49.308]  Why are they hijacking the jet to fly to the World Trade Center?
[01:44:49.749 --> 01:44:50.469]  And he explains.
[01:44:50.749 --> 01:44:52.671]  Jimmy, they like to flaunt it, don't they?
[01:44:53.251 --> 01:44:53.652]  They do.
[01:44:53.672 --> 01:44:57.014]  And I was saying earlier, I think the Democrats are in on it.
[01:44:57.094 --> 01:45:02.178]  I was at a progressive Democratic event in Los Angeles over the weekend.
[01:45:02.658 --> 01:45:07.619]  And Arianna Huffington got up there and she said, there are two reasons we lost the election.
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:13.201]  One, we played to the undecided, and two, our message wasn't good enough.
[01:45:14.161 --> 01:45:15.862]  Not a thing about the election fraud.
[01:45:15.882 --> 01:45:16.822]  It's like it never happened.
[01:45:16.842 --> 01:45:20.243]  It was our fault we lost, not election fraud.
[01:45:21.023 --> 01:45:22.564]  They're all in on it, Alex.
[01:45:22.584 --> 01:45:26.305]  At this point, I just have come over to the other side on this issue with you.
[01:45:27.691 --> 01:45:30.213]  Well, it's the facts.
[01:45:30.233 --> 01:45:31.793]  Let's play this Lone Gunman clip.
[01:45:31.954 --> 01:45:32.434]  Here it is.
[01:45:33.594 --> 01:45:36.256]  We know it's a war game scenario.
[01:45:36.276 --> 01:45:38.177]  It has to do with airline counterterrorism.
[01:45:39.698 --> 01:45:41.099]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[01:45:41.819 --> 01:45:43.180]  Because it's no longer a game.
[01:45:44.921 --> 01:45:51.265]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:53.306]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[01:45:55.547 --> 01:45:56.968]  Men who conceived of it in the first place.
[01:45:59.497 --> 01:46:03.098]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic heirloom?
[01:46:03.118 --> 01:46:03.538]  There you go.
[01:46:04.118 --> 01:46:05.679]  Indict the entire government, as usual.
[01:46:06.299 --> 01:46:06.859]  A faction.
[01:46:07.179 --> 01:46:09.400]  A small faction for what possible gain.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.940]  The Cold War is over, John.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.701]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against the arms market's flat.
[01:46:16.321 --> 01:46:25.884]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility.
[01:46:26.747 --> 01:46:28.308]  I'm begging to be smart-bombed.
[01:46:28.848 --> 01:46:29.668]  I can't believe it.
[01:46:29.688 --> 01:46:31.249]  This is about increasing arms sales.
[01:46:34.069 --> 01:46:34.269]  When?
[01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:35.610]  Tonight.
[01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:38.011]  How are you going to stop them?
[01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:40.171]  That's what it looks like.
[01:46:40.271 --> 01:46:41.832]  What does what look like?
[01:46:41.912 --> 01:46:43.212]  Motor protocol.
[01:46:43.272 --> 01:46:44.013]  Remote access.
[01:46:44.053 --> 01:46:45.573]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane.
[01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:46.793]  Hold it, sir.
[01:46:46.834 --> 01:46:48.054]  Keep your course.
[01:46:48.214 --> 01:46:49.955]  I need to know where Floyd's planning.
[01:46:56.049 --> 01:46:56.569]  I'm mapping the data now.
[01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:58.270]  Flyers, your flight's gonna make an unscheduled stop in exactly twenty minutes.
[01:47:21.787 --> 01:47:22.728]  All right.
[01:47:22.788 --> 01:47:23.768]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[01:47:23.828 --> 01:47:27.110]  You know, they had a Philips TV ad in 2000 where two F-16s bombed the World Trade Center.
[01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:29.751]  They fly over, drop two bombs, and then it goes, Philips, changing your world.
[01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:31.232]  I wonder why they do that, Jimmy.
[01:47:51.623 --> 01:47:55.184]  You know, they just have no respect for us.
[01:47:56.905 --> 01:48:03.708]  I was reading Bush's inaugural address, and the guy's raving crad.
[01:48:04.488 --> 01:48:09.350]  He says, "...mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fill the oath.
[01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:13.372]  Duties are defined not by my words, but by history.
[01:48:14.332 --> 01:48:16.853]  And then there came a day of fire."
[01:48:17.699 --> 01:48:30.926]  For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny, ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, read Islam, communism, Iraqi freedom fighters, and cross the most defended borders.
[01:48:30.986 --> 01:48:32.047]  We can't keep you safe.
[01:48:32.127 --> 01:48:32.947]  Be afraid.
[01:48:33.027 --> 01:48:33.748]  Be afraid.
[01:48:34.228 --> 01:48:39.150]  This guy and his inaugural address is unbelievable.
[01:48:39.331 --> 01:48:42.512]  Then, Jimmy, you track who's funding the real Muslim terror groups.
[01:48:42.612 --> 01:48:44.173]  It's L-C-I-A to C-I-A.
[01:48:44.453 --> 01:48:45.674]  We started bin Laden.
[01:48:46.348 --> 01:48:47.768]  Finish up, Eric, what you were saying.
[01:48:49.069 --> 01:48:56.691]  I now have my dad on the phone with me, and what you were saying before about showing them Road to Tyranny, I like that movie.
[01:48:57.091 --> 01:48:57.772]  I believe that.
[01:48:57.832 --> 01:49:05.474]  But, like, I was watching it one time, and my brother was in the room, and he said, oh, that's just a bunch of liberal... Yeah, please don't use expletives.
[01:49:06.212 --> 01:49:09.673]  He said that's a bunch of liberal crap to get at gullible people like me.
[01:49:09.813 --> 01:49:15.836]  Yeah, I'm liberal because I'm against Bush wanting to sign the assault weapons ban, and I'm against Alberto Gonzalez's for abortion.
[01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:22.638]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here... Look, I can't... Look... Is that your dad right there?
[01:49:22.658 --> 01:49:22.798]  DVD.
[01:49:22.838 --> 01:49:23.859]  Won't cost him a dime.
[01:49:23.899 --> 01:49:24.579]  Go to my site.
[01:49:24.979 --> 01:49:28.581]  If you'll watch that DVD and say it's the same thing, I'll eat my head.
[01:49:28.981 --> 01:49:31.042]  Well, I want to ask his father something.
[01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:34.313]  I mean, does Operation... Stay there.
[01:49:34.373 --> 01:49:35.675]  We'll come back and talk to your dad.
[01:49:35.935 --> 01:49:37.758]  Does Operation Northwoods exist?
[01:49:38.719 --> 01:49:40.641]  Does he know about Hitler and the Reichstag?
[01:49:41.142 --> 01:49:43.525]  Does he understand problem, reaction, solution?
[01:49:43.545 --> 01:49:47.470]  I mean, I'm sorry the real world's scary, but I can't change that.
[01:49:47.991 --> 01:49:49.413]  All I can do is fight the evil.
[01:49:50.414 --> 01:49:51.015]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.743 --> 01:49:58.088]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.268 --> 01:50:02.692]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.853 --> 01:50:07.217]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.257 --> 01:50:08.619]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.359 --> 01:50:10.380]  Panamers.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:14.623]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.683 --> 01:50:21.628]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:23.830]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.090 --> 01:50:34.497]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.757 --> 01:50:36.719]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is...

[01:51:06.414 --> 01:51:11.100]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[01:51:18.683 --> 01:51:30.469]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:52:54.005 --> 01:52:56.206]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:52:56.746 --> 01:52:59.626]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.167 --> 01:53:04.567]  All right, Eric's dad wouldn't come on and defend his ideas.
[01:53:04.587 --> 01:53:06.908]  And that's too bad.
[01:53:08.977 --> 01:53:11.479]  All we do is cover the facts here on this broadcast.
[01:53:11.539 --> 01:53:12.459]  I wish it wasn't true.
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:16.942]  You know, Jimmy, how do you think somebody like that deals with Operation Northwoods?
[01:53:16.962 --> 01:53:28.029]  I mean, we have the government explaining how they want to carry out terror attacks using airplanes, how they want to blame it on enemies, how killing Americans will cause a helpful wave of indignation, anger.
[01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.770]  That's a quote.
[01:53:29.590 --> 01:53:34.393]  And then I've had people argue with me and go, that isn't a real document when it's ABC News, Baltimore Sun.
[01:53:34.634 --> 01:53:35.494]  We have the document.
[01:53:35.514 --> 01:53:37.936]  The National Security Archives has it posted.
[01:53:38.036 --> 01:53:38.276]  Jimmy?
[01:53:39.210 --> 01:53:41.973]  Denial is not just a river in Egypt.
[01:53:43.474 --> 01:53:52.683]  These people, you know, they cannot believe their government is that bad, or they feel they can't do anything about it, and they just give up.
[01:53:52.903 --> 01:53:56.126]  Well, they always say something this big, you couldn't cover it up, you couldn't hide it.
[01:53:56.426 --> 01:53:57.067]  They haven't.
[01:53:57.187 --> 01:53:58.508]  It's an orgy of evidence.
[01:53:58.588 --> 01:53:59.870]  It's sloppily done.
[01:53:59.890 --> 01:54:04.274]  They won't look at it, and the mainstream media doesn't touch it.
[01:54:05.365 --> 01:54:12.408]  Well, they call you a conspiracy theorist and attack you for an hour on CNN, then they have a poll and 90% say the government's involved.
[01:54:12.548 --> 01:54:15.069]  Right, and then they quickly take that poll off the Internet.
[01:54:15.549 --> 01:54:17.310]  Yeah, so we're all a bunch of kooks here.
[01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:19.111]  Well, take a look at New York City.
[01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:26.494]  66% of New Yorkers want the investigation reopened, and the New York Times would not print the poll results.
[01:54:26.974 --> 01:54:30.596]  I had to buy a full-page ad to get the poll results in the New York Times.
[01:54:31.263 --> 01:54:32.384]  Let's take a call here.
[01:54:32.484 --> 01:54:35.205]  Let's talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:54:35.305 --> 01:54:37.266]  Ed, you're on the air with our guest, Jimmy Walters.
[01:54:37.486 --> 01:54:38.226]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:38.246 --> 01:54:39.207]  Hey, Jimmy.
[01:54:39.667 --> 01:54:39.807]  Hey.
[01:54:39.867 --> 01:54:41.848]  Hey, thanks very much for getting the word out.
[01:54:42.588 --> 01:54:49.231]  And I'm just very admirable of you to put out that monetary value to get the word out.
[01:54:49.332 --> 01:54:51.192]  And I really appreciate that.
[01:54:51.753 --> 01:54:53.393]  Jimmy Walters, the real deal.
[01:54:53.654 --> 01:54:53.954]  Yeah.
[01:54:54.334 --> 01:54:54.834]  Thank you.
[01:54:55.134 --> 01:54:56.195]  But I'd like to know...
[01:54:57.697 --> 01:55:04.860]  Where are those guys, those firefighters that were talking about how they heard that they just ducked and ran and heard these explosions going on?
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:13.924]  Well, I've got them all on video and I've got them in the news, but I've called them at home and they go, Mr. Jones, I'm aware of your work, I love my family, and I'm told not to talk to you.
[01:55:14.124 --> 01:55:19.767]  In fact, they were ordered by Bloomberg that they would be fired if they did, and a national security order was put in.
[01:55:19.807 --> 01:55:20.067]  Jimmy?
[01:55:21.367 --> 01:55:22.088]  The same thing.
[01:55:22.368 --> 01:55:26.710]  Dave Von Kleist and other people like him have tried to get these firefighters on the show.
[01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:29.411]  At the last minute, they always cancel out.
[01:55:29.892 --> 01:55:31.512]  Anthony Hilder had that same thing.
[01:55:31.773 --> 01:55:36.875]  He was talking about how that FEMA director... You have it on tape too, right?
[01:55:36.955 --> 01:55:40.997]  He said they were there the night before, and then that was denied by the government.
[01:55:41.117 --> 01:55:42.558]  Then Giuliani slipped up.
[01:55:42.758 --> 01:55:43.939]  See, these guys are human beings.
[01:55:43.979 --> 01:55:46.660]  He goes, oh yeah, we were having a drill that morning.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:49.121]  Well, I want to add this.
[01:55:49.141 --> 01:55:53.643]  Some so-called leaders of the 9-11 movement have been telling us, give up, you can't win, there's nothing you can do.
[01:55:53.723 --> 01:55:55.063]  That is a bunch of garbage.
[01:55:55.103 --> 01:55:55.564]  We are winning.
[01:55:55.624 --> 01:55:55.884]  Jimmy?
[01:56:17.114 --> 01:56:25.859]  I'm with you, Alex, and even if we're not, as they said in the last chapter of Lord of the Rings, we cannot win, but we will fight nonetheless.
[01:56:26.399 --> 01:56:32.923]  I'm not going to give up this country to these thugs, to these terrorists, the real terrorists, without a fight.
[01:56:33.459 --> 01:56:41.565]  And we are getting the word out, and the people like, I've gotten people that said, no way, and you get them to watch that video, and they say, oh my God.
[01:56:41.685 --> 01:56:59.738]  Well, Jimmy, Jimmy, it is so surreal for me to watch the people who were behind 9-11 stand there at ground zero, act like our saviors, knowing they're getting rid of our Bill of Rights, knowing they're lying about everything, knowing these are cold-blooded, psychopathic killers, and I have to be on top
[01:56:59.838 --> 01:57:01.598]  They have no conscience at all.
[01:57:01.698 --> 01:57:02.119]  It's a game.
[01:57:02.159 --> 01:57:05.479]  I mean, why is no senator, why is no representative other than Mark Dayton stepped up to the plate on this?
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:08.940]  And what has happened to Mark Dayton?
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:11.701]  I haven't heard about him, if they killed him yet.
[01:57:24.662 --> 01:57:25.262]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:25.362 --> 01:57:26.123]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:26.563 --> 01:57:28.884]  Jimmy Walter, fire out your website for folks.
[01:57:29.124 --> 01:57:31.465]  Reopen911.org.
[01:57:31.645 --> 01:57:32.085]  Go there.
[01:57:32.105 --> 01:57:39.729]  At the bottom of the page is the link for a free DVD over four hours on this, including Alex Jones stuff.
[01:57:39.749 --> 01:57:40.369]  Just stay there.
[01:57:40.409 --> 01:57:41.570]  We'll be a little bit longer.
[01:57:50.394 --> 01:57:51.014]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.694 --> 01:57:52.655]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.454 --> 01:57:54.555]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.215 --> 01:57:56.075]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.796 --> 01:57:58.716]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.736 --> 01:58:02.278]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.538 --> 01:58:06.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.041 --> 01:58:15.724]  Well, Jimmy Walter spent $3.5 million in TV, radio, and print ads exposing government involvement in 9-11.
[01:58:16.444 --> 01:58:18.025]  Now he's spending even more of his money.
[01:58:19.002 --> 01:58:27.528]  In downtown Manhattan, trying to help with lawsuits concerning all the asbestos and mercury and poison from the collapsed towers the government blocked funding for.
[01:58:29.290 --> 01:58:35.134]  And just keeping a few more minutes here, but I wanted to get some more of your calls out of the way for Jimmy, who I appreciate joining us so long.
[01:58:35.915 --> 01:58:38.917]  Let's talk to Ross in Ohio, then John in Ohio.
[01:58:39.277 --> 01:58:40.078]  Ross, you're on the air.
[01:58:40.118 --> 01:58:40.538]  Go ahead.
[01:58:41.279 --> 01:58:41.639]  Oh, yes.
[01:58:41.999 --> 01:58:47.143]  I just wanted to mention to any of the listeners that I have three executive orders.
[01:58:48.578 --> 01:58:51.880]  Executive Order 11000, 11002, and 11004.
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.622]  11000 provides for the mobilization of all civilians into work brigades under the government supervision.
[01:58:58.642 --> 01:59:07.046]  11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.
[01:59:07.066 --> 01:59:16.050]  And 11004 provides for Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations and populations.
[01:59:17.478 --> 01:59:19.299]  I just wanted to tell people about these.
[01:59:19.699 --> 01:59:27.181]  I have all these in the complete text of these executive orders documented on my website I just put up.
[01:59:27.661 --> 01:59:28.682]  Is it okay if I mention it?
[01:59:29.102 --> 01:59:29.702]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:59:30.302 --> 01:59:35.504]  The website is www.therevolutionist.tk.
[01:59:35.784 --> 01:59:41.245]  That's T-H-E-R-E-V-O-L-U-T-I-O-N-I-S-T.tk.
[01:59:41.606 --> 01:59:42.026]  All right.
[01:59:42.106 --> 01:59:42.966]  Well, thank you to them all.
[01:59:43.856 --> 01:59:44.196]  Jimmy?
[01:59:44.576 --> 01:59:44.957]  Yes, sir?
[01:59:45.157 --> 01:59:54.121]  You know, these executive orders, I have the Senate hearings from 86 where they were talking about a secret plan for martial law then after terror attacks.
[01:59:54.161 --> 01:59:56.022]  I mean, they've had this plan for a long time.
[01:59:57.242 --> 02:00:02.184]  Well, Alex, let's look at not just where they've been, but where they must be going.
[02:00:03.045 --> 02:00:05.146]  We know that they want total control.
[02:00:05.606 --> 02:00:08.247]  We know that they're expert at terrorist attacks.
[02:00:08.727 --> 02:00:12.789]  And we also know that the next big terrorist attack in the United States...
[02:00:13.527 --> 02:00:16.488]  The Constitution is toast, as Tommy Frank has told us.
[02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:26.033]  So, in my opinion, it's only a matter of time until they pull something, and it has to be bigger and badder than the last one.
[02:00:26.473 --> 02:00:29.014]  So, I'm very afraid for this country.
[02:00:30.815 --> 02:00:31.255]  I agree.
[02:00:31.335 --> 02:00:32.256]  John in Ohio.
[02:00:32.356 --> 02:00:33.136]  John, go ahead.
[02:00:36.397 --> 02:00:37.998]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about a number of things.
[02:00:38.278 --> 02:00:47.722]  But first, you know, Mark Twain once said that many Americans... He was speaking about the Spanish-American War and the lies that were used by the media and the government to manipulate opinion.
[02:00:47.762 --> 02:00:56.566]  And he said, many Americans thank God for the lies that the newspapers, the government, and the preachers tell them so they can sleep well at night while we slaughter people around the world.
[02:00:56.586 --> 02:01:04.050]  And, you know, I think that this... Eric, I should check other sources like globalresearch.ca, 911truth.org,
[02:01:06.696 --> 02:01:14.798]  And others, because you get the media, the media is considered the mother's milk by many people when it's actually a rattlesnake.
[02:01:14.858 --> 02:01:16.478]  It's a poisonous rattlesnake.
[02:01:16.938 --> 02:01:30.801]  And I think that, you know, you have this attitude that they try to spread that you must be crazy if you believe in conspiracies, but they've got conspiracies coming out of your ears, whether it's framing up the former Soviet Union, China, Iraq, Iran.
[02:01:31.428 --> 02:01:34.829]  I think we should start taking names of people like Michael Savage and this Tony Blakely,
[02:01:55.788 --> 02:02:14.454]  Who are the real treasonous traitors, and we should have a People's Court Tribunal to decide their punishment for dragging us into unprovoked, unconstitutional wars, acts of wars secretly conducted against countries like Iran and Syria, and we should have them put on the griddle rather than the other way around.
[02:02:15.254 --> 02:02:23.176]  And I believe that the Democrats are, as Jimmy says, are equally responsible.
[02:02:23.296 --> 02:02:24.957]  I think these neocons said,
[02:02:25.456 --> 02:02:37.699]  Even when they find out that we lied to them, the Democrats, the Republicans, and the corporate media will say, we've got to stay in Iraq, we've got to stay the course, and all of this kind of mumbo-jumbo, rather than getting out, turning around.
[02:02:37.719 --> 02:02:38.519]  All right, I hear you.
[02:02:38.539 --> 02:02:42.080]  Let me get a final comment from Jimmy Wald from the other side, and we're going to jump into some other news.
[02:02:42.481 --> 02:02:44.041]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.320]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:50.581]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.721 --> 02:02:54.622]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.662 --> 02:02:58.883]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:59.243 --> 02:03:03.024]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.144 --> 02:03:04.965]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.565 --> 02:03:08.488]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.508 --> 02:03:13.213]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.373 --> 02:03:16.436]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.616 --> 02:03:19.458]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:26.065]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.605 --> 02:03:28.707]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:03:45.848 --> 02:03:54.910]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.170 --> 02:04:06.393]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.733 --> 02:04:12.434]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:12.694 --> 02:04:13.635]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.852 --> 02:04:37.112]  803-4438.
[02:04:37.132 --> 02:04:39.554]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:53.323]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:02.702 --> 02:06:15.769]  Well, for the last hour and 20 minutes, we've been talking to Jimmy Walter, who's run $3.5 million worth of TV, radio, and print ads around the country exposing government prior knowledge and involvement in 9-11.
[02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:24.573]  Now he's helping expose and fund lawsuits, and I know we're on three stations in upstate New York,
[02:06:27.119 --> 02:06:33.383]  Where a lot of the victims of the fallouts' families live, so contact him and tell him about Jimmy's website and what he's doing.
[02:06:33.403 --> 02:06:36.565]  Because he certainly does what he says he's going to do, my friends.
[02:06:37.986 --> 02:06:48.812]  Concerning all the asbestos and mercury and the rest of it from those towers, and how the government covered it up and blocked funding to the firemen and the police and many others, just the citizens, period.
[02:06:49.433 --> 02:06:52.014]  So Jimmy's been on about that and a whole host of other 9-11 issues.
[02:06:53.887 --> 02:06:55.850]  Jimmy, I want to thank you for coming on the show with us.
[02:06:56.351 --> 02:06:58.213]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:06:58.894 --> 02:06:59.975]  Keep promoting your work.
[02:07:00.015 --> 02:07:01.938]  You really are doing a great job.
[02:07:02.479 --> 02:07:06.524]  Keep this health issue in front of them because there's no way they can dodge us.
[02:07:06.544 --> 02:07:11.731]  They can't say Arabs or hijackers caused them to lie about that poisonous air.
[02:07:12.973 --> 02:07:13.573]  Absolutely.
[02:07:13.593 --> 02:07:14.814]  And the website one more time?
[02:07:15.334 --> 02:07:23.218]  Go to reopen911.org and get your free DVD down at the bottom of the page about what it's all about.
[02:07:23.658 --> 02:07:24.319]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:07:24.639 --> 02:07:25.219]  All right, Jimmy.
[02:07:25.239 --> 02:07:25.739]  Take care.
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.361]  There goes Jimmy Walter.
[02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:32.383]  I wish I was independently wealthy like that.
[02:07:32.403 --> 02:07:35.264]  I'd be giving my DVDs away, too, but I can't do it.
[02:07:35.284 --> 02:07:39.066]  In fact, I need your support because I've got three webmasters.
[02:07:41.052 --> 02:07:50.101]  And then another part-time employee, and then of course I've got to pay for computers and the systems and the office and all of it.
[02:07:50.921 --> 02:07:55.005]  And I don't talk a lot about money here on the broadcast because money really means nothing to me.
[02:07:55.065 --> 02:07:55.706]  It's a tool.
[02:07:56.306 --> 02:07:58.709]  Money is like gas I put in my gas tank.
[02:07:58.749 --> 02:08:03.173]  It's something I need to just run my life and finance what I'm up to.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:18.007]  But your purchase of my videos, your purchase of my films and books, and the other great books and audio tapes and t-shirts and bumper stickers that we carry at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com make this broadcast on my websites possible.
[02:08:18.467 --> 02:08:20.588]  So please always keep that in mind.
[02:08:21.128 --> 02:08:22.509]  I know we've got a lot of callers here.
[02:08:22.529 --> 02:08:24.269]  I want to take a lot of calls in this hour.
[02:08:24.289 --> 02:08:27.851]  1-800-259-9231 But first off, I want to comment on something that John in Ohio mentioned.
[02:08:34.056 --> 02:08:56.232]  John, we don't need people's tribunals to try the Michael Wieners and the Blakelys of the world that want to put Americans in forced labor camps if we disagree with the government, who want to execute people like Cy Hirsch because he wrote a news article about covert wars, which are public.
[02:08:56.272 --> 02:08:57.473]  It's all over the foreign press.
[02:08:57.813 --> 02:08:58.974]  Cy Hirsch didn't break anything.
[02:08:59.874 --> 02:09:01.896]  We don't become them to fight them.
[02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:03.741]  We have grand juries.
[02:09:05.062 --> 02:09:07.063]  We have juries.
[02:09:07.943 --> 02:09:14.105]  And if somebody wants to call for putting people in camps, and they're not a government official, that's their right to do it.
[02:09:15.285 --> 02:09:20.987]  But I have the right to expose them, and I have the right to show what monsters they are.
[02:09:22.568 --> 02:09:25.409]  And we use this whole left-right labeling here.
[02:09:26.049 --> 02:09:27.890]  You know, that's what the New American does.
[02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:31.171]  They do a great job in analyzing the Washington Times article
[02:09:32.413 --> 02:09:36.035]  Written by Tony Blakely, they call him a communist commissar.
[02:09:37.856 --> 02:09:48.901]  Because this is what they did in communist countries, is they would go arrest you and put you before some people's tribunal, which were a bunch of minions of the system, and then send you to a gulag or worse.
[02:09:50.162 --> 02:09:58.426]  And so they expose Mr. Blakely as a communist or a Nazi, choose whichever command and control flavor you wish, and that's what he called for.
[02:09:59.153 --> 02:10:00.794]  He called, and he's got it right here.
[02:10:00.854 --> 02:10:06.979]  If found guilty, the accused faces death or imprisonment for any term or the years or for life.
[02:10:08.761 --> 02:10:13.465]  And he says, well, Cy Hirsch talked about how our troops have already invaded Iran, and how dare him?
[02:10:14.866 --> 02:10:19.530]  So he needs to be seized up and taken to a secret camp?
[02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:20.771]  There's already no...
[02:10:22.702 --> 02:10:24.304]  No arrest warrant, no charges.
[02:10:24.344 --> 02:10:27.607]  They just arrest people building lots of nice little camps.
[02:10:27.707 --> 02:10:33.513]  And if you watch 24, Threat Matrix, or any of these shows in the U.S.
[02:10:33.593 --> 02:10:43.202]  or England, they secretly arrest people for selling pot, and they explain to them, you're going to a camp for the rest of your life because selling marijuana aids terrorists.
[02:10:44.504 --> 02:10:46.486]  And millions of Americans watch these shows.
[02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:54.546]  And the pot dealer has their children taken and they cry as daddy's put in an armored truck and taken to a camp for the rest of his life.
[02:10:54.686 --> 02:10:59.390]  Why is TV showing pot dealers going to camps for the rest of their life?
[02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:05.594]  So that the weak-minded people that set their moral compass according to television will watch this.
[02:11:05.914 --> 02:11:07.996]  You know, you're so-called conservative fox.
[02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:19.493]  Has the shows where they send the man to the Enchanted Island with all the porno women who try to seduce them to have sex with them.
[02:11:20.014 --> 02:11:21.714]  How is that Christian and conservative?
[02:11:22.575 --> 02:11:26.396]  You know, desperate housewives trying to seduce teenage youth.
[02:11:27.176 --> 02:11:28.797]  How is this Christian and conservative?
[02:11:29.197 --> 02:11:30.097]  All these shows.
[02:11:32.958 --> 02:11:35.099]  Every Fox show I've seen and other...
[02:11:35.862 --> 02:11:36.803]  Networks as well.
[02:11:37.263 --> 02:11:38.584]  The male is bad.
[02:11:38.644 --> 02:11:39.925]  He's a bad role model.
[02:11:39.965 --> 02:11:41.226]  The woman is in command.
[02:11:41.546 --> 02:11:42.767]  The kids are out of control.
[02:11:42.887 --> 02:11:50.993]  It's designed to break down the family so you do not have that tribal unit that will defend against the corrupt state.
[02:11:51.974 --> 02:11:55.757]  They want that unit destroyed so you'll be assimilated into the greater whole.
[02:11:57.738 --> 02:12:04.203]  So they can institutionalize you on welfare or the criminal justice system or into the psychiatric system better.
[02:12:04.815 --> 02:12:11.437]  This is merging with the oneness of the New World Order.
[02:12:14.618 --> 02:12:15.979]  You ever read the book We?
[02:12:15.999 --> 02:12:23.261]  It's really the fountainhead of 1984, Brave New World, and THX 1138, and the rest of them.
[02:12:23.281 --> 02:12:24.882]  You ought to read We.
[02:12:26.982 --> 02:12:29.163]  Written by somebody who spent some time in a gulag.
[02:12:30.427 --> 02:12:33.630]  So he wrote a science fiction book of what he thought the world would be like in 2000.
[02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:37.893]  This was written like in 1925 or something.
[02:12:39.234 --> 02:12:40.955]  And Huxley points towards we.
[02:12:41.035 --> 02:12:42.216]  So did Eric Blair.
[02:12:42.256 --> 02:12:44.798]  You know him as George Arwell.
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:48.001]  This isn't a joke, people.
[02:12:48.561 --> 02:12:51.143]  This is scientific destruction of your mind.
[02:12:51.644 --> 02:12:53.925]  Scientific destruction of individuality.
[02:12:55.427 --> 02:12:59.650]  The globalists know exactly what they're doing.
[02:13:01.138 --> 02:13:04.142]  And so, when you flip on a channel, Saving Amy.
[02:13:04.984 --> 02:13:06.686]  This is the type of stuff listeners mail me.
[02:13:07.106 --> 02:13:09.470]  But every time I turn on TV, which is rare.
[02:13:10.444 --> 02:13:12.445]  I mean, I probably watch two hours a month now.
[02:13:12.986 --> 02:13:16.508]  Every time I'm in a restaurant and something's on the big screen TV, I'll say, turn that up, please.
[02:13:16.728 --> 02:13:19.810]  The cops are torturing somebody, and it's good that they're torturing them.
[02:13:20.351 --> 02:13:31.818]  Or I'm at the TV station, and shows are on in the background, and I watch them, and it's about how good torture is, and how good secret arrest is, or I turn on NYPD Blue, and you've got to have a warrant to come in here.
[02:13:32.159 --> 02:13:32.939]  Whack them on the head.
[02:13:32.999 --> 02:13:34.220]  I don't need a warrant anymore.
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:36.722]  And the good guys are doing this.
[02:13:38.621 --> 02:13:48.371]  When you... Shows like Judging Amy, where her mom's a judge and she's a CPS worker, I've seen two episodes of it, and in both episodes they're grabbing homeschoolers' children.
[02:13:49.793 --> 02:13:51.134]  Homeschooling parents' children.
[02:13:51.946 --> 02:13:55.287]  There's a woman who believes the UN is corrupt and the IMF is taking over.
[02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:58.769]  And so it turns out that she's evil because she believes this.
[02:13:58.789 --> 02:13:59.749]  So they take her children.
[02:13:59.869 --> 02:14:01.970]  I mean, you turn it on and there it is.
[02:14:02.630 --> 02:14:13.174]  And then you read the Associated Press and all over the country they've got drills where homeschooler parents come and kill all the children and they put fake blood on the children and go, the homeschoolers are going to kill you!
[02:14:13.394 --> 02:14:19.676]  And the kids cry and they have drills with men with machine guns running around and the children cry and they all learn.
[02:14:19.736 --> 02:14:20.397]  Homeschoolers.
[02:14:20.437 --> 02:14:20.837]  I mean, this is...
[02:14:21.677 --> 02:14:24.698]  The Soviet Union didn't have re-education camps this good.
[02:14:24.718 --> 02:14:26.698]  This is high-tech, folks.
[02:14:29.659 --> 02:14:32.319]  And you're busy talking about, I think Bush is conservative.
[02:14:32.719 --> 02:14:34.459]  I associate my power with him.
[02:14:34.479 --> 02:14:35.940]  I reflected glory.
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.961]  George Bush is a gibbering, mindless, gun-grabbing, Ten Commandment-hating puppet.
[02:14:44.861 --> 02:14:45.382]  Oh, man.
[02:14:45.442 --> 02:14:47.522]  And then I just, every week now, Ann Coulter.
[02:14:48.248 --> 02:14:49.489]  We just need to start nuking people.
[02:14:49.509 --> 02:14:50.789]  We need to kill more civilians.
[02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.851]  We need to arrest people who disagree with the government.
[02:14:54.451 --> 02:14:55.272]  Michelle Malkin.
[02:14:55.572 --> 02:14:56.533]  Put people in camps.
[02:14:56.553 --> 02:14:57.333]  The case for camps.
[02:14:57.353 --> 02:14:58.274]  Put everyone in camps.
[02:14:59.754 --> 02:15:00.455]  Tony Blakely.
[02:15:00.855 --> 02:15:02.316]  Oh, we need to seize up.
[02:15:03.756 --> 02:15:06.778]  And I've got his quotes here about it's time to give up our freedoms.
[02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:07.979]  I'm actually looking at the quotes.
[02:15:08.479 --> 02:15:09.600]  It's time for America.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:11.841]  You know, the police state is here, but it isn't bad.
[02:15:11.861 --> 02:15:13.622]  A police state is good.
[02:15:14.378 --> 02:15:19.360]  And it's time for us to give up our freedoms and it's time to arrest people and execute them.
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:31.784]  Yes, let's take the Pulitzer Prize winning writer who exposed the CIA and Project Phoenix and who exposed flying out the Taliban and Al Qaeda to safety and all this.
[02:15:31.804 --> 02:15:33.885]  Let's take him and let's kill him.
[02:15:34.865 --> 02:15:38.747]  Yes, let's kill reporters openly in the newspaper.
[02:15:39.027 --> 02:15:40.627]  Hi, I'm Tony Blakely.
[02:15:40.927 --> 02:15:42.388]  I'm an editor at the Washington Times.
[02:15:45.546 --> 02:15:46.287]  Let's kill!
[02:15:46.307 --> 02:15:49.209]  Let's start killing journalists!
[02:15:50.369 --> 02:15:52.791]  Folks, they're not introducing these ideas for nothing.
[02:15:53.632 --> 02:15:54.212]  You understand?
[02:15:54.232 --> 02:15:56.834]  In fact, you don't believe me.
[02:15:56.874 --> 02:15:58.675]  Let me just find quotes here.
[02:16:00.096 --> 02:16:08.722]  Federal prosecutors should review the information disclosed by Mr. Hersh and determine whether or not his conduct falls within the prescribed conduct of the state.
[02:16:09.502 --> 02:16:14.686]  If found guilty, the accused faces death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life.
[02:16:16.638 --> 02:16:17.979]  But I've got all these quotes here.
[02:16:17.999 --> 02:16:24.723]  Blakely has previously spoken of the supposed need for media to become an appendage of the executive branch.
[02:16:24.783 --> 02:16:27.185]  Quote, the media should be falling in line.
[02:16:27.585 --> 02:16:28.145]  Close quote.
[02:16:28.686 --> 02:16:33.949]  He complained in an interview with the January 17, 2002 issue of the Insight magazine.
[02:16:34.689 --> 02:16:38.192]  The danger is great enough for us to cut back now on civil liberties.
[02:16:38.932 --> 02:16:40.293]  It is all a question of balance.
[02:16:41.073 --> 02:16:44.075]  He goes on to say this is something that has to happen.
[02:16:44.115 --> 02:16:44.896]  This is for good.
[02:16:45.782 --> 02:16:46.362]  I'm trying to find it.
[02:16:46.382 --> 02:16:47.303]  It's a huge article.
[02:16:47.783 --> 02:16:52.747]  I'm trying to find the quotes here where he talks about giving up freedoms.
[02:16:53.407 --> 02:16:55.849]  Folks, it's just out of control.
[02:16:55.869 --> 02:17:07.937]  I mean, imagine writing a science fiction book 50 years ago where in America you turn on the TV and they're doing torture in front of everybody and torture is good.
[02:17:08.829 --> 02:17:18.457]  And in the real world, they're doing drills where parents that homeschool their own children are terrorists and they dump fake blood all over the children and tell them, they're coming to get you, they're coming to kill you!
[02:17:19.257 --> 02:17:20.818]  I mean, it's mind control.
[02:17:20.838 --> 02:17:21.899]  That's what a cult would do.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:24.401]  Imagine Jim Jones if he was doing that.
[02:17:24.701 --> 02:17:27.083]  Those that aren't with us, why, they want to kill you.
[02:17:27.123 --> 02:17:30.226]  Let's do a drill where the authorities come in and pour blood on you!
[02:17:31.044 --> 02:17:32.425]  You know, ah, let's do it.
[02:17:32.445 --> 02:17:35.546]  I mean, it's just like, it's just cult cuckoo land.
[02:17:35.906 --> 02:17:37.407]  They're mass brainwashing us.
[02:17:37.827 --> 02:17:39.268]  Your calls are coming up when we get back.
[02:17:39.288 --> 02:17:44.110]  I got a Bush administration official saying they control reality.
[02:17:45.930 --> 02:17:50.152]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[02:17:50.912 --> 02:17:52.153]  In business and socially.
[02:17:52.771 --> 02:17:59.174]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:17:59.754 --> 02:18:01.475]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[02:18:02.195 --> 02:18:08.178]  While you listen, verbal advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:18:08.798 --> 02:18:10.359]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:18:10.899 --> 02:18:13.060]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:15.661]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:18:16.242 --> 02:18:17.342]  And it's so easy.
[02:18:18.042 --> 02:18:20.123]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:18:20.904 --> 02:18:21.424]  When you want.
[02:18:22.043 --> 02:18:22.684]  Where you want.
[02:18:23.504 --> 02:18:28.527]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[02:18:29.348 --> 02:18:31.890]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:32.070]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:32.590]  That's 419-WORD.
[02:18:32.610 --> 02:18:32.910]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:18:45.706 --> 02:18:46.687]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.767 --> 02:18:51.551]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:51.711 --> 02:18:59.518]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:59.778 --> 02:19:05.163]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:19:05.363 --> 02:19:12.349]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:13.130]  We're good to go.
[02:19:37.789 --> 02:19:38.009]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.237 --> 02:19:48.338]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[02:19:48.658 --> 02:19:50.959]  Not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[02:19:51.179 --> 02:19:58.301]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:19:58.482 --> 02:20:03.863]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:20:04.123 --> 02:20:08.765]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[02:20:08.945 --> 02:20:09.525]  See you next time.
[02:20:27.575 --> 02:20:32.419]  Reclaim that youthful and energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help from Minerals from the Sea.

[02:20:47.599 --> 02:20:50.480]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?

[02:21:37.603 --> 02:21:40.446]  I've got a little four or five minute bush worship montage.
[02:22:01.599 --> 02:22:03.559]  From the inauguration last week.
[02:22:04.159 --> 02:22:05.260]  That's coming up right now.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:06.360]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:11.621]  I don't want to get into how they're going to use MRIs to actually manipulate your brain.
[02:22:13.001 --> 02:22:17.482]  And everybody will have to go under these to decide if we're mentally ill or not.
[02:22:17.522 --> 02:22:25.643]  And then if we are, they're going to force treatment with the new special brain scanners that are so high-powered they actually change brain chemistry.
[02:22:25.703 --> 02:22:28.884]  This is the Times of London, you name it, in front of me.
[02:22:29.474 --> 02:22:37.721]  And then I, strangely enough, I saw this article Saturday, and then, strangely enough, on Sunday, I heard an NPR, like, 20-minute report on it.
[02:22:38.161 --> 02:22:39.242]  And it was so scary.
[02:22:39.262 --> 02:22:41.984]  Because it was all positive, you know, how they were pushing it.
[02:22:43.185 --> 02:22:47.088]  Oh, her mind wasn't good, but the scanner helped her.
[02:22:47.668 --> 02:22:49.830]  We'll find all those that are really ill.
[02:22:51.892 --> 02:22:53.413]  Let's talk to Dave in Michigan.
[02:22:53.453 --> 02:22:54.334]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:22:54.414 --> 02:22:54.854]  Go ahead.
[02:22:54.934 --> 02:22:55.875]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[02:22:56.434 --> 02:23:01.477]  There's a story on CBSNews.com about this is No Name Calling Week.
[02:23:02.177 --> 02:23:11.143]  This is an initiative developed by the New York-based Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, which seeks to ensure that schools safely accommodate students.
[02:23:11.847 --> 02:23:13.428]  All sexual orientation.
[02:23:13.448 --> 02:23:21.711]  Yeah, and that's thought crime stuff where they then get to go into the schools and recruit your children and go, would you like to come to one of our meetings or learn more?
[02:23:21.731 --> 02:23:31.615]  I mean, that'd be like if a group of men came in and said, we're here to visit with your cheerleader daughters to make sure that they're not have a bad view of sex.
[02:23:32.235 --> 02:23:35.416]  We'd like to, I mean, literally, folks, it's recruiting in the schools.
[02:23:35.816 --> 02:23:37.777]  Keep sex, period, out of the schools.
[02:23:38.368 --> 02:23:52.834]  Well, it says here that this author, James Howe, the openly gay author of The Misfits, deals with much-tainted middle schoolers, one of them gay, who ran for student council on a platform advocating the end to nasty name-calling.
[02:23:53.714 --> 02:24:01.737]  And then it says in here that in Iowa, Pleasant Valley School Board forced teachers to stop reading it out loud elementary school classes.
[02:24:03.918 --> 02:24:05.238]  Stop reading what out loud?
[02:24:05.378 --> 02:24:06.959]  This book, The Misfits.
[02:24:07.810 --> 02:24:10.691]  Where it makes the gay students the heroes of the... Well, of course.
[02:24:10.891 --> 02:24:11.352]  Yeah.
[02:24:11.372 --> 02:24:16.454]  You're not supposed to have books in school about sex, period.
[02:24:17.274 --> 02:24:18.715]  Well, especially to an eight-year-old.
[02:24:18.835 --> 02:24:21.256]  And then it's all this gay stuff.
[02:24:21.296 --> 02:24:22.196]  It's out of control.
[02:24:22.216 --> 02:24:34.362]  Well, it says here, too, that Michigan Governoress Jennifer Granholm issued a proclamation recognizing the event and more than 40 national organizations have enlisted as partners, including the Girl Scouts,
[02:24:35.131 --> 02:24:40.034]  The National Association of Elementary and Secondary School Principals and the National Education Association.
[02:24:40.054 --> 02:24:41.155]  Yeah, leave our children alone.
[02:24:41.275 --> 02:24:42.315]  Leave their innocence alone.
[02:24:42.335 --> 02:24:42.996]  Let me tell you something.
[02:24:43.456 --> 02:24:51.441]  I read mainstream articles out of Massachusetts and other areas over the years where they take 10-year-olds.
[02:24:52.499 --> 02:24:53.901]  We're good to go.
[02:25:15.757 --> 02:25:19.540]  This is mainstream news like it's normal.
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:20.561]  Imagine!
[02:25:20.581 --> 02:25:23.443]  Your child's supposed to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic except they're being bussed.
[02:25:23.823 --> 02:25:33.891]  You know, if it's not a Harry Potter movie, it's to the local college to have them teach them different sexual, if you even call it sex, things they can do.
[02:25:33.911 --> 02:25:38.975]  Well, who is a prepubescent boy going to have sex with except with a child molester?
[02:25:40.396 --> 02:25:41.497]  Hey, exactly.
[02:25:41.657 --> 02:25:43.438]  Sir, sir, listen.
[02:25:43.478 --> 02:25:45.280]  I read the news articles on air years ago
[02:25:46.210 --> 02:25:47.752]  And people complained.
[02:25:48.253 --> 02:25:51.377]  Okay, I would tell you what they, I mean, this is all over the country.
[02:25:51.877 --> 02:25:57.024]  I mean, this was, this is stuff that, you know, that I didn't hear about until I was in college.
[02:25:57.164 --> 02:25:58.105]  I mean, even hear about.
[02:25:58.386 --> 02:26:00.088]  And when I got there, I heard enough of it.
[02:26:00.548 --> 02:26:04.894]  Well, let me tell you, sir, this is, you know, this is stuff that will kill you.
[02:26:06.092 --> 02:26:09.553]  I mean, you know, it's unbelievable.
[02:26:09.993 --> 02:26:13.334]  I mean, you hit the nail on the head.
[02:26:14.074 --> 02:26:19.935]  There was one thing where they told them, if an older man wants to meet with you in a parking lot, it's not bad, do it.
[02:26:20.476 --> 02:26:21.456]  It's funny you mention that.
[02:26:21.496 --> 02:26:23.016]  That was one of the things I could mention.
[02:26:23.396 --> 02:26:27.697]  The other stuff was, well, it's where somebody puts their arm somewhere.
[02:26:28.597 --> 02:26:30.858]  And they were teaching them this is a loving, good thing to do.
[02:26:32.369 --> 02:26:38.013]  Well, that's what they were always trying to sign you up for when I was in college, was these group encounter sessions like that.
[02:26:38.533 --> 02:26:43.736]  Yeah, where you go and they teach you how to... It's very loving to do this for your partner.
[02:26:43.756 --> 02:26:45.537]  Who's ever setting next year, you know?
[02:26:47.178 --> 02:26:59.946]  More than that, the stuff they were teaching 10- and 12-year-olds is literally stuff that I didn't even ever hear about at some party where somebody's talking about something gross until I was 20-something years old.
[02:27:00.267 --> 02:27:00.847]  They're going to take...
[02:27:02.468 --> 02:27:03.108]  It's incredible.
[02:27:03.128 --> 02:27:04.289]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:27:05.569 --> 02:27:08.330]  You talk about evil, folks, it's upon us everywhere.
[02:27:10.871 --> 02:27:13.412]  And it's horrible.
[02:27:13.832 --> 02:27:14.912]  It's unspeakable.
[02:27:16.253 --> 02:27:18.114]  But imagine, you send your child off to school.
[02:27:19.254 --> 02:27:20.114]  Well, it's like this.
[02:27:20.154 --> 02:27:27.477]  You've got to have a permission slip for your daughter or your son to go to the mall or the school or to go to the planetarium or the zoo.
[02:27:27.997 --> 02:27:30.798]  But to go have an abortion, they don't even need a note in most states.
[02:27:32.081 --> 02:27:33.744]  I don't need a note for this either, boy.
[02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:37.351]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.832 --> 02:27:39.456]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.358 --> 02:27:43.043]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.803 --> 02:27:47.764]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[02:28:06.876 --> 02:28:10.757]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[02:28:10.977 --> 02:28:15.439]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:28:15.599 --> 02:28:19.440]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:25.862]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:28:26.062 --> 02:28:28.863]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:28:29.043 --> 02:28:32.404]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle one-year money-back guarantee.

[02:28:56.982 --> 02:29:01.266]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.606 --> 02:29:04.628]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.949 --> 02:29:08.372]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.692 --> 02:29:18.058]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.299 --> 02:29:21.821]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:29:46.656 --> 02:29:49.458]  SuperSilver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[02:30:06.388 --> 02:30:11.632]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:30:22.581 --> 02:30:23.261]  We're good to go.
[02:30:23.281 --> 02:30:23.441]  I think?
[02:30:46.923 --> 02:30:49.685]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:49.705 --> 02:30:53.567]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.587 --> 02:30:56.688]  Alright, I want to cover some other news.
[02:30:56.868 --> 02:31:00.110]  I also want to take your calls, but I want to play this clip.
[02:31:00.130 --> 02:31:06.313]  This is a little compilation that Ryan, one of my great employees, put together.
[02:31:06.333 --> 02:31:11.956]  It could be hours of this, but this is just a little bit of it.
[02:31:13.257 --> 02:31:15.318]  Of the literal worship of Lord Bush.
[02:31:16.373 --> 02:31:20.076]  At the coronation last week, so here it is.
[02:31:22.037 --> 02:31:24.678]  And then we'll be right back after we play this clip.
[02:31:26.279 --> 02:31:30.942]  This clip, by the way, is on prisonplanet.tv right now.
[02:31:33.464 --> 02:31:36.566]  We're trying to stream it off the web, but it's trying to connect right now.
[02:31:37.907 --> 02:31:48.229]  James Rosen is live with a look at this day of pageantry, pride, patriotism, and once again, James, marching bands.
[02:31:48.589 --> 02:31:50.190]  A whole lot of drumming and trumpets.
[02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:52.590]  Good afternoon to you, John, and to our viewers.
[02:31:52.650 --> 02:32:03.753]  President Bush spent the first minutes of his second term vowing to heal divisions in American society and pledging his help to those across the world who are suffering political oppression and longing for freedom.
[02:32:04.253 --> 02:32:09.054]  The president never uttered the word Iraq and never spoke of American troops returning home.
[02:32:10.195 --> 02:32:16.876]  All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the United States will not ignore your oppression.
[02:32:18.617 --> 02:32:31.080]  For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, violence will gather
[02:32:32.401 --> 02:32:34.722]  And multiply in destructive power.
[02:32:36.202 --> 02:32:36.642]  Freedom.
[02:32:37.023 --> 02:32:37.503]  Tyranny.
[02:32:37.683 --> 02:32:38.043]  Freedom.
[02:32:38.203 --> 02:32:38.563]  Freedom.
[02:32:38.743 --> 02:32:39.063]  Freedom.
[02:32:39.123 --> 02:32:39.603]  Tyranny.
[02:32:39.784 --> 02:32:40.144]  Freedom.
[02:32:40.264 --> 02:32:40.604]  Freedom.
[02:32:40.764 --> 02:32:41.224]  Tyranny.
[02:32:41.364 --> 02:32:41.844]  Tyranny.
[02:32:42.024 --> 02:32:42.925]  Permanent tyranny.
[02:32:43.585 --> 02:32:48.666]  Look at the number of uniformed personnel, all of them armed.
[02:32:49.307 --> 02:32:50.407]  It's estimated there are 66,000.
[02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:57.053]  Armed and uniformed members of law enforcement here.
[02:32:57.593 --> 02:33:05.279]  Roughly one police officer or soldier tasked to this duty per every four or five spectators.
[02:33:05.299 --> 02:33:07.001]  The highest ratio in history.
[02:33:08.082 --> 02:33:10.784]  You've driven around this city, Chris, the last couple of days.
[02:33:10.824 --> 02:33:12.085]  Brian and I were talking about it.
[02:33:12.505 --> 02:33:13.886]  It was close to an armed camp.
[02:33:14.807 --> 02:33:17.469]  Again, coming in, you had to get hand-patted down.
[02:33:17.509 --> 02:33:19.190]  You had to go through a magnetometer.
[02:33:19.210 --> 02:33:20.672]  You had to have your bag panthered.
[02:33:21.932 --> 02:33:33.483]  There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants.
[02:33:34.664 --> 02:33:46.154]  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush!
[02:33:54.878 --> 02:34:00.261]  This is a love of material success, of even flaunting of wealth and furs.
[02:34:00.721 --> 02:34:06.564]  This isn't the cloth coat republicanism that may have turned the tide in November.
[02:34:06.604 --> 02:34:10.266]  This is a bold statement of we've got it, we're going to flaunt it, we're going to have some fun.
[02:34:11.039 --> 02:34:13.326]  The selection of clothing was excellent.
[02:34:13.868 --> 02:34:15.513]  By the First Lady, absolutely.
[02:34:15.573 --> 02:34:17.839]  She's looking resplendent in her winter white.
[02:34:18.717 --> 02:34:20.718]  She looks absolutely stunning.
[02:34:21.199 --> 02:34:22.139]  Oh, she's beautiful.
[02:34:22.159 --> 02:34:23.680]  She looks so pretty.
[02:34:23.721 --> 02:34:26.442]  The First Lady was truly breathtaking when she came out.
[02:34:26.462 --> 02:34:32.367]  It was one of those moments where, up on the stand, you could almost hear an audible sigh as she came out.
[02:34:32.427 --> 02:34:35.909]  She really was sort of a vision in the white dress.
[02:34:35.949 --> 02:34:37.890]  Winter white, I believe, would be the proper term.
[02:34:38.071 --> 02:34:41.353]  There's a sense of a little friskier second term for the First Lady.
[02:34:42.683 --> 02:34:45.185]  Well, and you know, the president is looking very sharp today, too.
[02:34:45.225 --> 02:34:46.686]  I think there's a calmness about him.
[02:34:46.726 --> 02:34:49.248]  There's a certain serenity that we're seeing in President Bush.
[02:34:50.449 --> 02:34:51.349]  Look at this serenity.
[02:34:51.369 --> 02:34:52.710]  He's wearing a blue tie.
[02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.611]  And that says?
[02:34:54.291 --> 02:34:56.353]  He almost always wears a blue tie.
[02:34:56.473 --> 02:35:00.916]  Well, this president has always worn sort of a baby blue or a royal blue tie.
[02:35:00.936 --> 02:35:01.917]  Royal blue is what I like.
[02:35:01.977 --> 02:35:02.257]  Yeah.
[02:35:02.357 --> 02:35:05.559]  That blue tie, is that a sign of royalty?
[02:35:06.099 --> 02:35:10.262]  And, God, we're running out of things to say, except here we are looking at the royal family in a sense.
[02:35:10.282 --> 02:35:11.043]  They look so great.
[02:35:11.747 --> 02:35:13.248]  Oh, I think they're adorable.
[02:35:13.348 --> 02:35:15.349]  Apparently, when they show up, they don't have to wait in line.
[02:35:15.369 --> 02:35:16.430]  They go right to the front.
[02:35:17.070 --> 02:35:18.831]  They are cutie pies, as I've said before.
[02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:23.234]  Remember, don't you, when there was that unpleasantness in Texas about the drinking age?
[02:35:23.734 --> 02:35:31.799]  Yeah, but the guy, this hopeless guy who dialed 911 because one of these girls ordered a tequila or something.
[02:35:31.819 --> 02:35:31.799]  911?
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:34.841]  And one of them is a... It's great because there's the one that's sort of the fun one.
[02:35:34.901 --> 02:35:36.242]  You can have a lot of fun with this.
[02:35:36.262 --> 02:35:37.163]  It's just generalized.
[02:35:37.183 --> 02:35:38.383]  There's a serious one in dark here.
[02:35:38.424 --> 02:35:40.605]  It's like the Archie Andrews comic...
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:46.343]  We've seen a number of faces, and of course the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has some face time today.
[02:35:46.443 --> 02:35:51.326]  We don't know what to make of the fact that he seemed to be so much a part of the winner's circle, do we?
[02:35:51.346 --> 02:35:53.827]  We don't know why he was so much in evidence today.
[02:35:54.147 --> 02:35:58.510]  He's the Republican governor of the most populous state in the Union, who is very supportive.
[02:35:58.530 --> 02:36:00.051]  He's an old friend of 41's.
[02:36:01.191 --> 02:36:02.032]  What are your thoughts today?
[02:36:02.052 --> 02:36:07.795]  Do you have any thoughts about the possibility of changing the Constitution so that someday you could be sitting in the good seats up front?
[02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:13.092]  Well, first of all, I'm having an excellent seat here, sitting with all the governors here from this great country.
[02:36:13.612 --> 02:36:33.720]  And to me, you know, as a foreigner, when you come over here, you know, this means, I think, and I know it means a lot to the American people, but it means even more to me, because I've watched every inauguration on television or live since I've come to this country in 1968, and I get very emotional about events like that.
[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:37.121]  This is really terrific, and I think this is a very unique time.
[02:36:37.865 --> 02:36:39.126]  The new order of the ages.
[02:36:39.146 --> 02:36:40.767]  The new order of the ages.
[02:36:40.787 --> 02:36:42.408]  The new order of the ages.
[02:36:42.428 --> 02:36:44.030]  The new order of the ages.
[02:36:44.050 --> 02:36:45.671]  The new order of the ages.
[02:36:47.692 --> 02:36:51.655]  All right, we'll go ahead and go to your calls now, quickly.
[02:36:51.815 --> 02:36:52.976]  Lynn in Pennsylvania.
[02:36:53.016 --> 02:36:53.797]  Lynn, go ahead.
[02:36:53.817 --> 02:36:57.199]  Hi, that was quite a show there.
[02:36:57.499 --> 02:36:58.780]  Look at your leader!
[02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:00.041]  Wow!
[02:37:00.061 --> 02:37:02.383]  Hey, what I caught right off the bat was 6,000... 6,000...
[02:37:06.014 --> 02:37:07.515]  I was going to mention that.
[02:37:07.535 --> 02:37:09.017]  It was 66,000, but he goes, 6,000, 66,000.
[02:37:10.157 --> 02:37:16.442]  Yeah, I wondered if there was actually another 6 there.
[02:37:16.462 --> 02:37:17.163]  No, he said 666.
[02:37:17.984 --> 02:37:20.065]  No, I picked up on that, but I wasn't going to say anything.
[02:37:20.445 --> 02:37:22.027]  Well, I picked it up right away.
[02:37:22.087 --> 02:37:26.190]  It was like, who's the Reagan son who's got the show on MSNBC?
[02:37:26.931 --> 02:37:30.133]  He goes, oh, Arnold Schwarzenegger loves to go to the 666 Club.
[02:37:30.513 --> 02:37:32.835]  Oh, it's such a fancy club, only the elite go to the 666 Club.
[02:37:34.315 --> 02:37:37.137]  Well, that was actually one of the reasons why I called you.
[02:37:37.778 --> 02:37:42.462]  If you actually go to the Bible, you will see so many 12s.
[02:37:43.302 --> 02:37:45.844]  Of course, 11s are under 12, right?
[02:37:45.864 --> 02:37:48.667]  You know, there's 12 apostles and 12 faiths.
[02:37:48.907 --> 02:37:55.212]  And the little girl that died and brought her back to life, she was 12 years old.
[02:37:55.732 --> 02:38:01.657]  And the girl that touched the cloak and she had that bleeding disorder, she had it for 12 years.
[02:38:02.538 --> 02:38:02.958]  And when the...
[02:38:04.929 --> 02:38:06.310]  Okay, so ma'am, what's your point, though?
[02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:12.214]  The point is, 11, last Thursday I was listening to your show.
[02:38:13.015 --> 02:38:13.235]  Yeah.
[02:38:13.735 --> 02:38:17.638]  And you were talking about the Illuminati being obsessed with 11s and 6s.
[02:38:18.419 --> 02:38:18.999]  Yes, they are.
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:20.400]  Well, there's why.
[02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:22.702]  Tell you what, I'm going to play a clip for you.
[02:38:22.742 --> 02:38:23.663]  This is our great leader.
[02:38:24.703 --> 02:38:26.605]  We have to interrupt broadcasting for this right now.
[02:38:26.625 --> 02:38:26.965]  Go ahead.
[02:38:28.132 --> 02:38:36.094]  The President of the United States, George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush!
[02:38:36.114 --> 02:38:37.075]  Wait for them!
[02:38:37.095 --> 02:38:43.776]  Let them know that you love America!
[02:38:43.836 --> 02:38:45.357]  Wait for them!
[02:38:45.417 --> 02:38:51.178]  Let them know that you love America!
[02:38:52.459 --> 02:38:53.199]  All right.
[02:38:53.299 --> 02:38:54.339]  Anything else, Lynn?
[02:38:54.959 --> 02:38:56.080]  Well, yeah.
[02:38:57.409 --> 02:39:01.950]  My point is, in the Bible, the Bible has so many 12s.
[02:39:01.970 --> 02:39:04.830]  The devil is under God.
[02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:07.591]  He is less than God.
[02:39:08.251 --> 02:39:09.651]  That's why they use the 11s.
[02:39:10.571 --> 02:39:11.732]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:39:12.032 --> 02:39:13.852]  The elite is obsessed with numerology.
[02:39:14.992 --> 02:39:19.313]  Let us now go ahead and go to Bob in New Hampshire.
[02:39:19.333 --> 02:39:20.013]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:39:20.033 --> 02:39:21.993]  Oh, hello, AJ.
[02:39:22.333 --> 02:39:22.733]  Hello.
[02:39:22.753 --> 02:39:25.534]  I want to bring up two things.
[02:39:26.488 --> 02:39:38.971]  One, there was a steady note, I would say it was in the order of 2,000 cycles, on the high side of the frequency.
[02:39:39.051 --> 02:39:39.871]  I was listening on 9985.
[02:39:40.052 --> 02:39:45.453]  You're talking about listening to us on shortwave and you heard something over there.
[02:39:45.473 --> 02:39:49.074]  There's all sorts of stuff on radio, period, much less shortwave.
[02:39:49.214 --> 02:39:50.554]  There's no modulation on it.
[02:39:51.514 --> 02:39:52.555]  I just thought I'd tell you.
[02:39:53.195 --> 02:39:53.395]  Now...
[02:39:53.959 --> 02:40:06.545]  The other thing that I wanted to bring up, back in 1962, there was a plane, TWA, that crashed into the Empire State Building?
[02:40:07.665 --> 02:40:07.925]  No.
[02:40:08.946 --> 02:40:09.786]  That's not what happened.
[02:40:10.527 --> 02:40:18.990]  It was in 1943, in a heavy fog bank, a bomber crashed into it on maneuvers.
[02:40:19.931 --> 02:40:22.272]  No, I'm not talking about that one.
[02:40:23.502 --> 02:40:23.922]  Oh, really?
[02:40:25.223 --> 02:40:26.784]  Well, I'm ignorant then.
[02:40:26.904 --> 02:40:29.746]  I thought that was the only time the Empire State Building was hit by a plane.
[02:40:30.226 --> 02:40:50.499]  No, the plane crashed into the Empire State Building, and I happened to be playing records at a radio station that night, and I had to take it off the telephone.
[02:40:50.519 --> 02:40:52.781]  Wow, so I wonder why I never heard of that.
[02:40:54.013 --> 02:40:55.654]  Well, they're too young.
[02:40:56.555 --> 02:40:57.795]  Well, I know about what happened in 1943.
[02:40:57.835 --> 02:41:03.999]  Well, yeah, in 1943... So what happened with the plane?
[02:41:04.159 --> 02:41:04.979]  How big was the plane?
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:07.241]  It was an airliner.
[02:41:08.742 --> 02:41:10.783]  I don't know anything more about it.
[02:41:11.463 --> 02:41:11.743]  Really?
[02:41:11.803 --> 02:41:15.185]  And it hit the Empire State Building?
[02:41:15.466 --> 02:41:15.686]  Yes.
[02:41:16.766 --> 02:41:18.347]  And it did not bring down the building.
[02:41:18.367 --> 02:41:21.009]  Hmm.
[02:41:22.125 --> 02:41:23.745]  I know the bomber that hit it didn't.
[02:41:23.845 --> 02:41:25.106]  No, it didn't even knock anything over.
[02:41:26.526 --> 02:41:40.148]  Well, I was kind of worried because one of the members of the church was a flight engineer.
[02:41:41.468 --> 02:41:45.289]  And he said, no, he wasn't on that plane.
[02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.989]  He might have been, he said.
[02:41:48.009 --> 02:41:49.550]  Okay.
[02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:51.290]  Very matter-of-factly.
[02:41:52.368 --> 02:41:54.829]  And let it go at that.
[02:41:55.470 --> 02:42:00.352]  Well, he was flight engineer for CWA.
[02:42:01.633 --> 02:42:15.801]  And the point is that if that plane crashing into the Empire State Building did not damage the building to the point of it had to be torn down or something,
[02:42:16.539 --> 02:42:19.701]  Yeah, they say they blew up the towers, so that's public.
[02:42:19.721 --> 02:42:20.861]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:20.901 --> 02:42:22.342]  Very interesting call, Bob.
[02:42:22.942 --> 02:42:24.603]  Let's talk to Dr. William Deagle.
[02:42:24.643 --> 02:42:25.544]  Doc, how are you doing?
[02:42:26.144 --> 02:42:26.944]  Just great.
[02:42:27.685 --> 02:42:30.826]  Your first guest is really important, what he's saying.
[02:42:31.747 --> 02:42:32.327]  Jimmy Walter?
[02:42:32.947 --> 02:42:33.268]  Yes.
[02:42:33.568 --> 02:42:42.252]  Dr. Lieberman, who's the head of our American Academy of Environmental Medicine that I'm a member of, has a position statement out on the Twin Towers.
[02:42:42.392 --> 02:42:44.073]  When those towers went down, there was 100,000 tons of glass
[02:42:46.798 --> 02:42:50.541]  Some of the particles, they estimate, were carried 10,000 to 20,000 miles.
[02:42:52.142 --> 02:42:55.104]  There was 5,000 tons of asbestos released in those buildings.
[02:42:55.124 --> 02:42:56.285]  That's why it was like snow.
[02:42:56.585 --> 02:42:57.886]  I think more than 5,000 tons.
[02:42:58.126 --> 02:42:58.626]  At least.
[02:42:58.746 --> 02:42:59.307]  At least 5,000.
[02:42:59.367 --> 02:43:03.090]  There was ton after ton after ton per building.
[02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.410]  Right.
[02:43:03.430 --> 02:43:04.791]  5,000 per building.
[02:43:05.671 --> 02:43:09.254]  Just as best as it was on the tower support beams.
[02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:25.322]  The building was just full of it, and also the amount of... This is an actual fact that our association has actually done some reviewing of the amount of dioxins and dibenzofurans released when those old-style generators and step-down transformers were in the walls of the building.
[02:43:25.902 --> 02:43:36.390]  When they were incinerated, when that building came down, the amount of dioxins and dibenzofurans in Manhattan was so high, they should have evacuated the whole area
[02:43:37.202 --> 02:43:43.549]  But that's why they have this World Trade Center cough syndrome and the toxic heavy metals, asbestos and everything, that's why you can do a high-speed
[02:43:44.492 --> 02:43:49.115]  Well, I have the new scientists.
[02:43:49.155 --> 02:43:53.197]  They scan the firefighters' lungs and police lungs, and it's all full of it.
[02:43:53.497 --> 02:43:56.199]  Oh, you can see it white out.
[02:43:56.239 --> 02:43:57.540]  They don't get any treatment, though.
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:43:58.500]  It's ridiculous.
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:01.222]  Actually, there should be a federal class-action lawsuit again.
[02:44:01.242 --> 02:44:01.582]  There is.
[02:44:01.622 --> 02:44:03.303]  That's what Jimmy Walter's getting involved in.
[02:44:03.523 --> 02:44:08.666]  Well, I'd say if you should contact Dr. Lieberman at the American Academy of Environmental Medicine...
[02:44:09.147 --> 02:44:10.688]  He's going to get lots of data.
[02:44:10.768 --> 02:44:11.888]  We have tons of data.
[02:44:11.908 --> 02:44:14.969]  Well, you ought to go to Jimmy's site and email him and get in contact with him.
[02:44:15.089 --> 02:44:16.089]  I will indeed.
[02:44:16.129 --> 02:44:17.150]  What's his website?
[02:44:18.810 --> 02:44:19.731]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:44:19.811 --> 02:44:21.311]  But I'll track him down through the internet.
[02:44:21.331 --> 02:44:23.192]  But I just wanted to mention that because that's very important.
[02:44:23.212 --> 02:44:24.472]  The people in that end of the city.
[02:44:25.172 --> 02:44:28.534]  And those materials double, believe it or not, the world concentration.
[02:44:28.894 --> 02:44:32.835]  The world concentration of dioxins and dibenzofurans that are
[02:44:33.368 --> 02:44:35.930]  Yeah, it released more than a volcano.
[02:44:36.130 --> 02:44:40.133]  Right, it actually doubled the whole concentration in the world of those two pollutants.
[02:44:40.153 --> 02:44:42.354]  They're the most dangerous pollutants we know worldwide.
[02:44:43.995 --> 02:44:44.716]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:44.776 --> 02:44:45.456]  Very interesting.
[02:44:45.476 --> 02:44:46.177]  Good to hear from you.
[02:44:46.197 --> 02:44:46.937]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:44:47.337 --> 02:44:49.159]  Last caller, then I've got a few news items.
[02:44:49.179 --> 02:44:49.719]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:51.881]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:44:52.041 --> 02:44:52.561]  Hello, buddy.
[02:44:53.001 --> 02:44:54.042]  Quick question here.
[02:44:54.782 --> 02:44:55.483]  Robert P.M.
[02:44:55.503 --> 02:45:01.347]  Barnett's heart and his little constitution, or the Pentagon's new map...
[02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:03.340]  How do they all fit in together?
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:12.984]  I haven't had a chance to do a cross-reference on what he talks about in the book as the, you know, they talk about the core New World Order countries and these fringe countries.
[02:45:13.544 --> 02:45:17.625]  It would be interesting to see how many of those were destroyed in the tsunami.
[02:45:19.646 --> 02:45:28.769]  Well, they list almost every third world country for invasion and takeover, and they openly say it's for world government, and the Pentagon works for the world government.
[02:45:28.789 --> 02:45:29.689]  I mean, that was on C-SPAN.
[02:45:30.276 --> 02:45:35.641]  Did you hear that HAARP was actually sold to a British company, ABB?
[02:45:35.881 --> 02:45:37.423]  Yeah, that was like five years ago.
[02:45:37.683 --> 02:45:42.888]  Right, and did you note that ABB is a subsidiary of Roker International, which is headquartered in India?
[02:45:42.908 --> 02:45:51.196]  Yeah, ABB is actually Swiss, and the head of the board on that was Donald Rumsfeld when they gave the reactors to North Korea.
[02:45:51.456 --> 02:45:52.397]  Ah, Mr. Aspartame.
[02:45:53.419 --> 02:46:05.773]  Yeah, whether it's Terminator genes at Monsanto or aspartame or giving Saddam chemical and bio weapons, anything super evil, reactors in North Korea, it's Rumsfeld is an actual demon.
[02:46:06.234 --> 02:46:09.197]  I mean, literally, he like flies around like a shadow.
[02:46:09.237 --> 02:46:12.161]  If it's wicked, you find him behind it.
[02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:13.340]  It's unbelievable.
[02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:14.821]  Tax time's coming up, too.
[02:46:14.881 --> 02:46:18.522]  I was wondering if we could hear from Bob Schultz on your show, or perhaps Erwin Schiff.
[02:46:18.542 --> 02:46:19.202]  What happened to him?
[02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.082]  Erwin Schiff, do you know?
[02:46:20.102 --> 02:46:20.402]  I don't know.
[02:46:20.422 --> 02:46:21.642]  He's still out there doing his thing.
[02:46:21.662 --> 02:46:22.282]  He's doing his thing?
[02:46:22.583 --> 02:46:22.883]  That's good.
[02:46:22.923 --> 02:46:29.644]  Those guys are definitely in the same grouping as you, patriots for true Americans, and we appreciate your work.
[02:46:30.124 --> 02:46:31.465]  Well, I appreciate you, Tim.
[02:46:31.485 --> 02:46:31.985]  Take care.
[02:46:32.465 --> 02:46:33.365]  All right.
[02:46:34.265 --> 02:46:40.127]  Some of the other news that I have here, it's all very, very, very important.
[02:46:41.821 --> 02:46:45.864]  Is the move to put every child in America under an MRI.
[02:46:47.305 --> 02:46:54.630]  And there's new advanced types that actually pick up cellular level activity in the brain, electrochemical activity.
[02:46:56.232 --> 02:47:02.036]  And you see the quacks are being exposed for claiming these non-medical doctors, these psychologists.
[02:47:02.785 --> 02:47:13.309]  Claiming everybody's mentally ill, and the drug companies write and pay to have all these new diagnoses to widen the net every year, and they're trying to push a movement to force us to go on all these drugs.
[02:47:13.389 --> 02:47:14.209]  New Freedom Initiative.
[02:47:15.449 --> 02:47:21.671]  Well, now become aware of not just brain scanners, but magnetic resonance systems that actually change the brain.
[02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:28.334]  So, oh, if we say you're ill, we're going to forcibly magnetize areas of your brain and change your brain function.
[02:47:29.434 --> 02:47:32.195]  It's akin to a lobotomy or electroshock therapy.
[02:47:33.039 --> 02:47:37.963]  And we're also going to force you to go under these to see, quote, if you're mentally ill.
[02:47:39.224 --> 02:47:40.605]  Now this is from the London Telegraph.
[02:47:40.966 --> 02:47:43.327]  The day my brain was turned off by a magnet.
[02:47:45.249 --> 02:47:45.629]  Snap!
[02:47:45.689 --> 02:47:51.194]  As the machine fires the first magnetic pulse, my scalp feels like it's being pinched and puckered.
[02:47:52.275 --> 02:47:53.696]  Then it goes on to describe...
[02:47:54.528 --> 02:48:01.514]  The first practical demonstration of the TMS, made 20 years ago by Professor Anthony Baker, the University of Sheffield.
[02:48:01.554 --> 02:48:10.041]  Since then, it has become a relatively simple, non-invasive, and usually painless way to interfere with the workings of the most complex known object in the universe, the human brain.
[02:48:11.562 --> 02:48:17.547]  And now they say they can, with 40 seconds of magnetic stimulation, do whatever they want to the brain.
[02:48:18.442 --> 02:48:27.428]  I was happy to become a guinea pig as Professor Rothwell shoots electrical pulses through a copper coil the shape of a figure eight held against my scalp.
[02:48:28.628 --> 02:48:36.213]  Then it goes into... It goes into his brain and changes his brain chemistry.
[02:48:36.353 --> 02:48:37.334]  Oh, it feels so good.
[02:48:37.354 --> 02:48:39.215]  Oh, it feels so good.
[02:48:39.275 --> 02:48:42.397]  Then I heard NPR Sunday do a 20-minute special on this.
[02:48:43.456 --> 02:48:45.539]  We're just all going to be strapped in for our own good.
[02:48:45.559 --> 02:48:50.565]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.746 --> 02:48:55.091]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:57.093 --> 02:48:59.695]  To use this disaster with a new world order.
[02:48:59.776 --> 02:49:02.638]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:02.878 --> 02:49:07.102]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.162 --> 02:49:14.109]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.209 --> 02:49:16.231]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.471 --> 02:49:27.036]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.217 --> 02:49:32.579]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:50.818 --> 02:51:52.738]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:53.199 --> 02:51:55.940]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:07.103 --> 02:52:09.084]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:52:11.664 --> 02:52:13.345]  Just running through some of the news here.
[02:52:13.725 --> 02:52:18.266]  Probe of Boston University lab illnesses look to be lurking contaminant.
[02:52:19.426 --> 02:52:24.948]  It's a laboratory, and they don't know how they released a deadly biovirus, but it's no big deal.
[02:52:24.968 --> 02:52:30.389]  The government's going to build three dozen more of these in major populated areas around the country.
[02:52:31.804 --> 02:52:37.008]  Iraq's defense minister wants to hand Chalibi over to Jordan, where he was convicted for stealing $300 million.
[02:52:37.368 --> 02:52:44.194]  This is who they first wanted to run Iraq, but he demanded more cash, and so he fell out of favor.
[02:52:44.234 --> 02:52:48.477]  Now they've got a new criminal, his cousin, his cousin Lally, running things.
[02:52:48.517 --> 02:52:50.058]  He's frankly worse, if it's possible.
[02:52:50.819 --> 02:52:52.280]  And guess why they're going to arrest him?
[02:52:52.320 --> 02:53:01.487]  Not for all the crimes, but they say that he made disparaging remarks about the Iraqi government, and that is illegal.
[02:53:03.979 --> 02:53:04.419]  That's right.
[02:53:05.099 --> 02:53:08.101]  You can go read the AFP articles about this.
[02:53:08.381 --> 02:53:10.041]  That's the democracy, the freedom over there.
[02:53:10.822 --> 02:53:15.763]  Because if you make disparaging remarks about the government, you're arrested.
[02:53:15.803 --> 02:53:18.885]  So, boy, that is real-life freedom.
[02:53:19.285 --> 02:53:25.227]  Well, it's like what the Washington Times editor is saying, Mr. Blakely.
[02:53:25.767 --> 02:53:27.608]  He's saying, hey, you disagree with the government?
[02:53:28.348 --> 02:53:29.309]  That's aiding terrorists?
[02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:30.349]  We want to execute you.
[02:53:31.545 --> 02:53:32.025]  All right.
[02:53:32.065 --> 02:53:32.566]  Well, freedom.
[02:53:33.106 --> 02:53:35.187]  Pakistan joins the U.S.
[02:53:35.267 --> 02:53:37.509]  in attacking Iran over support for terror on a telegraph.
[02:53:38.029 --> 02:53:39.310]  Pakistan's got nukes.
[02:53:39.390 --> 02:53:40.671]  Our government helped them develop.
[02:53:41.211 --> 02:53:42.292]  Pakistan's teetering.
[02:53:42.312 --> 02:53:43.532]  It could be taken over any day.
[02:53:43.572 --> 02:53:45.774]  They got missiles that can hit the U.S.
[02:53:45.794 --> 02:53:47.555]  They're like North Korea, but worse.
[02:53:50.096 --> 02:53:51.897]  That is how advanced their stuff is.
[02:53:52.678 --> 02:53:53.638]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:53:55.179 --> 02:53:56.080]  You got nuclear weapons.
[02:53:56.140 --> 02:53:59.462]  You're bad, Iran, by the way, because you're developing peaceful systems.
[02:54:00.525 --> 02:54:01.346]  Unbelievable.
[02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:05.591]  It just gets so crazy.
[02:54:05.932 --> 02:54:09.336]  There's been all these taser deaths, 70 plus in the last couple of years.
[02:54:09.916 --> 02:54:11.959]  More and more deaths now on a weekly basis.
[02:54:12.399 --> 02:54:17.285]  And so the answer is, Taser International is going to strengthen the power of the taser.
[02:54:17.325 --> 02:54:19.888]  They say that is the answer.
[02:54:20.530 --> 02:54:21.992]  I think we're good to go.
[02:54:22.072 --> 02:54:23.513]  I think we're good to go.
[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:45.321]  Cuckoo behavior.
[02:54:45.461 --> 02:54:46.582]  But they're not stupid.
[02:54:47.003 --> 02:54:55.890]  They know that in this insane world with mass mental illness that they've actually created, and they call normalcy mental illness, they know that this becomes reality.
[02:54:56.310 --> 02:55:10.822]  From an article by Ron Susskind in the New York Times in the summer of 2002, after I had written an article in Esquire that the White House didn't like about Bush's former communications director, Karen Hughes, I had a meeting with a senior advisor to Bush.
[02:55:11.322 --> 02:55:13.164]  He expressed the White House's displeasure
[02:55:15.692 --> 02:55:23.439]  And then he told me something that at the time I didn't fully comprehend, but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.
[02:55:24.019 --> 02:55:40.052]  The aide said that guys like me were in what we call the reality-based community, which he defined as people who believe, these are quotes, that solutions emerge from your judicious study of disciplined reality and discernible reality.
[02:55:40.713 --> 02:55:43.555]  I nodded and murmured something about enlightened principles and
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:45.800]  He cut me off.
[02:55:45.940 --> 02:55:48.721]  That's not the way the world really works anymore, he continued.
[02:55:48.881 --> 02:56:04.706]  We are an empire now, and we act, we create our own reality, and while you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will, we act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.
[02:56:05.186 --> 02:56:10.948]  We're history's actors, and all of you will be left to just study what we will do.
[02:56:12.468 --> 02:56:14.609]  So we make reality, we're God,
[02:56:16.664 --> 02:56:21.068]  That's what O'Brien says to Winston as he tortures him in 1984.
[02:56:21.248 --> 02:56:29.975]  You see, he says, Winston, if it's in your mind that I'm holding up five fingers but you only see one, I control your mind.
[02:56:30.135 --> 02:56:31.196]  I control reality.
[02:56:32.117 --> 02:56:33.198]  presentplanet.tv.
[02:56:33.278 --> 02:56:33.779]  God bless.
[02:56:36.161 --> 02:56:36.621]  Hello, folks.
