[00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.267]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:07.968]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:09.790]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:11.272]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:12.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:17.217]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:21.862]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:35.449]  All right, my friend.
[00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.070]  My friends.
[00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.612]  Big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:48.296]  The 11th day of January 2005 will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:57.320]  Greg Pallast, BBC Newsnight reporter, best-selling author and researcher, will be joining us in the next hour.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.361]  You do not want to miss that.
[00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:05.335]  We'll also have wide-open phones and take your calls early in this first hour.
[00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:07.596]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:11.318]  Well, Bush is nominating Chertoff, which in Russian does indeed mean the devil.
[00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:13.359]  Very fitting.
[00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.601]  Bush is nominating the devil to have the...
[00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.613]  Homeland Security job.
[00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:34.096]  The last guy they tried to get in there had lied about his education.
[00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:39.419]  He hadn't even graduated from high school and, well, had a lot of mafia connections and other things.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.684]  So he bowed out over the shill story of an illegal alien nanny that he hadn't been paying taxes on.
[00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.586]  And then all the mistresses and the rest of it came out.
[00:01:51.927 --> 00:01:54.208]  But the new guy, Chertoff, has been
[00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:58.523]  An interesting character for a long, long time.
[00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:04.425]  He's the architect of homeschoolers being terrorists, gun owners being terrorists.
[00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:09.607]  He's the architect of all these anti-terror drills around the country.
[00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:14.789]  And they admit that he is the architect of much of the current policies.
[00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.910]  It's like Alberto I Love Torture Gonzales.
[00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:23.412]  He's the architect of much of Patriot Act 1 and 2, along with Viet Dinh.
[00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:25.706]  This is from Newsday.
[00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:28.828]  Really, it went beyond photos.
[00:02:56.215 --> 00:03:00.818]  And again, Bush picks ex-prosecutor for Homeland Post.
[00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:07.201]  Bush picks former prosecutor who helped craft early war on terror strategy for Homeland Security.
[00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.482]  We'll be covering that story.
[00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:13.565]  Guantanamo Brits freed are starting to tell their story.
[00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:17.847]  And I don't spend enough time on this, but I will spend some time on it today.
[00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:23.350]  Mobile phone risk to humans, especially to children.
[00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:27.620]  The evidence is overwhelming, but still, I have one.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.847]  I routinely don't have the little earpiece plugged into it, and I put the microwave device up against my head.
[00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:40.010]  It's stupid, and we should all stop doing it.
[00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.994]  But it's really analogous to everything else in our world.
[00:03:44.954 --> 00:03:47.857]  It's just something that has been integrated into our society...
[00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:51.920]  And so we just accept it, no matter how bad it is for us.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.163]  Like sodium fluoride and aspartame, or in the case of Iraq, depleted uranium.
[00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:02.065]  So, that's coming up as well.
[00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:04.526]  Also, U.S.
[00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:07.167]  lost 1.5 million jobs to China.
[00:04:09.608 --> 00:04:16.552]  Over the last few years, this is out of Reuters, but the mainstream media tells us that the economy is just doing great.
[00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:22.788]  And in the inauguration, don't be seen with a cross.
[00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.589]  Crosses are banned.
[00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:29.612]  Because we know that folks in the Hellfire Club don't like to see them.
[00:04:30.793 --> 00:04:38.859]  They'll be doing Diablo symbols when they're being sworn in, and Pat Robertson will show it to you and say, look, the sign of Jesus.
[00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:42.061]  I'm not joking.
[00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:42.962]  They probably will.
[00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:48.406]  But inauguration controversy widens.
[00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:53.988]  Crosses will be banned from this month's inaugural parade in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.331]  And liberals are being arrested for anti-war sites.
[00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:05.394]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:09.977]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:14.539]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:15.920]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.421]  Panama.
[00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:21.928]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:28.917]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.120]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.362]  Homeland Security.
[00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:41.929]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.413]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:13.331]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:02.523]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:07:02.743 --> 00:07:10.087]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.810]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:24.916]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:29.342]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:32.185]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:38.394]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.176]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:07:40.436 --> 00:07:41.336]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:07:41.416 --> 00:07:44.417]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:07:44.577 --> 00:07:47.738]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:51.119]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.261]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:56.421]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:08:00.862 --> 00:08:05.924]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.304 --> 00:08:08.565]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:37.872]  All right, we're going to be talking about Ward Bush's second nominee to fill the Homeland Security post, the equivalent of the SS or the position that Heinrich Himmler held for Adolf Hitler.
[00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:54.425]  And that's to be Mr. Chertoff, who has been sneaking around for a very long time in the background, helping to set up the draconian police state in America.
[00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:58.266]  We'll also talk about 1.5 million jobs lost to China.
[00:08:58.286 --> 00:08:59.187]  This is from Reuters.
[00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:00.787]  We've got Greg Pallast.
[00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:05.350]  Top BBC News Tonight investigative journalist joining us in the second hour.
[00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:12.553]  And as I said, we're going to have open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:17.516]  Coming up in about 10-15 minutes, I'm going to air about a two-minute clip from the History Channel.
[00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:24.359]  This is going up on InfoWars.com right now as we speak.
[00:09:27.581 --> 00:09:31.502]  And they admit what listeners of this broadcast already knew.
[00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:41.264]  Did you know that Benjamin Franklin, one of our founding fathers, was actually a British agent and did everything he could to bring down this country?
[00:09:41.284 --> 00:09:48.205]  He was a member of the Illuminati at the highest levels.
[00:09:51.906 --> 00:09:55.807]  Benjamin Franklin died in England
[00:09:56.832 --> 00:10:03.836]  Benjamin Franklin, when they dug into his basement, they found a whole bunch of dead children and dead women.
[00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:09.499]  And they'd had their hearts cut out.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.822]  Now, this had been in the times of London years ago, and this was well known.
[00:10:15.842 --> 00:10:25.167]  He was a member of the Hellfire Club, and they engaged in black masses, conjured the devil himself,
[00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:34.003]  According to published writings of some of Benjamin Franklin's friends.
[00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:40.786]  Benjamin Franklin was a Benedict Arnold that never got caught.
[00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:45.228]  Good old Benjamin Franklin.
[00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:51.091]  But it's very interesting to see the History Channel just come right out and admit it.
[00:10:54.434 --> 00:10:56.955]  The History Channel just comes right out and admits it.
[00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:13.320]  Why are they publishing photos of human sacrifice, mock human sacrifice, from 1915 in major publications like National Geographic?
[00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:21.623]  Why has the Grove released a photo of a bound black boy with men standing all around him at the Grove?
[00:11:24.702 --> 00:11:26.583]  Why are they flaunting it in our face?
[00:11:26.783 --> 00:11:30.004]  Why do they flaunt Schwarzenegger, a Grove minion, in our face?
[00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:36.146]  And Morgenthaler Jones, the lady out pushing the Amen for Arnold group, sat on this show.
[00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.207]  Oh, her husband is a Bohemian Grove member in training.
[00:11:39.508 --> 00:11:43.009]  Why, there's a 20-year waiting list for even the most elite people.
[00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:50.192]  Why are they flaunting it all in our face?
[00:11:51.832 --> 00:11:53.793]  They think they've got it all sewn up.
[00:11:55.891 --> 00:12:00.473]  They're getting control of the voting in this country with their electronic voting machines, their fraud systems.
[00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:03.395]  They're building more and more prisons.
[00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:12.499]  They're turning up the heat with television, with almost every major police drama, nothing but torture and violating people's rights.
[00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.280]  Oh, that's what the good guys do?
[00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:20.262]  The emails are starting to pour in about this, by the way.
[00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:25.465]  Listeners are starting to pay attention, listeners that still watch television, to just the nightly
[00:12:26.883 --> 00:12:30.984]  Promotion of torture and secret arrest and I don't need a warrant.
[00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:33.464]  The cop busting the door and beat somebody up.
[00:12:34.445 --> 00:12:36.385]  Strapping people down in torture chairs.
[00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:39.346]  We're being marinated.
[00:12:39.406 --> 00:12:40.526]  We're being basted.
[00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:42.566]  We're being submersed.
[00:12:42.786 --> 00:12:44.027]  We're being inundated.
[00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:45.847]  We're being acclimated.
[00:12:45.907 --> 00:12:52.368]  We're being rolled on the spit in the fires of evil.
[00:12:53.248 --> 00:12:55.849]  Being trained to accept all of this.
[00:13:00.023 --> 00:13:07.468]  Very, very serious to have History Channel just come out and admit what we already know to be the historical fact.
[00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:10.730]  And they go on in the piece.
[00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.611]  We're not going to air the whole thing.
[00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:13.452]  We're airing a small clip just to analyze it.
[00:13:15.893 --> 00:13:27.521]  They go on in the piece, make excuses for it to glorify it, to condition the public that, oh, they're really the good guys.
[00:13:28.897 --> 00:13:44.681]  A listener sent me the email with a clip of it, and then I remembered that months ago a listener actually sent me a tape of it, and I popped it in the VCR, watched it, put it back in a stack of tapes I've been sent, and never even did anything with it.
[00:13:45.682 --> 00:13:47.742]  Because I'm swimming in stuff like this.
[00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:50.403]  We're all swimming in it.
[00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:53.919]  We're all becoming conditioned.
[00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:58.362]  I mean, now they come out and say, yeah, we are going to put chips on all the children in America.
[00:13:58.742 --> 00:14:01.804]  Yeah, we are going to put 30 million people in prison up from 7 mil.
[00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:11.371]  Yeah, we are going to bring us into a world government and get rid of our borders and every major road is going to be a toll road with a transponder tracking you.
[00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:16.795]  And yeah, Prozac does make you...
[00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:21.541]  Increase your chances of committing suicide 1,200 times?
[00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:22.442]  So what?
[00:14:22.482 --> 00:14:23.723]  We're not going to pull it off the market.
[00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:25.204]  We're going to make more people take it.
[00:14:25.404 --> 00:14:26.645]  We're going to make you take it.
[00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:32.449]  It's just all being flaunted and thrown right in our faces.
[00:14:34.131 --> 00:14:36.312]  I don't have a radical radio show.
[00:14:38.174 --> 00:14:42.117]  It may sound radical, but it's just covering what's real and what's happening.
[00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:47.501]  And it's very, very serious.
[00:14:49.617 --> 00:14:51.960]  Look at the neocon spin from Drudge.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.164]  Bush nominates Clinton nemesis to Homeland.
[00:14:56.025 --> 00:15:04.995]  A former federal prosecutor who played a prominent role in the Senate Whitewater investigation was picked by President Bush to head Homeland Security.
[00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:09.601]  Chief, the White House said today, Michael Chertoff...
[00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.310]  A former U.S.
[00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:21.953]  Attorney in New Jersey was Chief Republican Counsel to a Senate committee delving into former President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Arkansas business dealings.
[00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:22.993]  Ms.
[00:15:23.013 --> 00:15:27.474]  Clinton, now a Senator representing New York, will be among those considering Chertoff's nomination.
[00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:37.616]  Chertoff headed the Justice Department's Criminal Division from 2001 to 2003, where he played a central role in the nation's legal response to September 11th developing.
[00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:41.348]  Let me tell you something.
[00:15:41.468 --> 00:15:45.651]  The whole investigation in Congress was a whitewash.
[00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:49.493]  They didn't talk about communist generals in the Commerce Department.
[00:15:49.893 --> 00:15:51.374]  They didn't talk about murders.
[00:15:51.855 --> 00:15:55.037]  They didn't talk about drug dealers being pardoned.
[00:15:55.737 --> 00:16:00.861]  They focused in on sexual issues and small real estate deals.
[00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:05.824]  Things that were teeny tiny compared to bigger things in the aggregate.
[00:16:06.722 --> 00:16:07.443]  We're good to go.
[00:16:07.463 --> 00:16:07.683]  I think?
[00:16:29.642 --> 00:16:41.272]  But Chertoff is bad because the left and the right don't like him because this guy has been involved in writing up these memos that look out for Christian conservatives, look out for homeschoolers.
[00:16:41.672 --> 00:16:46.496]  He's been involved in writing up the memos saying they can arrest people for anti-war signs.
[00:16:46.836 --> 00:16:51.060]  He's been involved in helping write up Patriot Acts with Viet Dinh and others.
[00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:55.864]  I mean, Ashcroft didn't really write anything himself.
[00:16:55.924 --> 00:16:57.706]  He was just kind of a puppet, but bad enough.
[00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:06.073]  But with Alberto Gonzalez and with... Now with Chertoff, we're getting actual brains in there.
[00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:11.197]  Very, very serious.
[00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:16.842]  Bush picks former prosecutor who helped craft early war on terror strategy for Homeland Post...
[00:17:17.734 --> 00:17:28.838]  President Bush has chosen Federal Appeals Court Judge Michael Chertoff to be his new Homeland Security Chief, turning to a former federal prosecutor who helped craft the early war on terror strategy the AP has learned.
[00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:44.624]  And it goes on to say that he headed the Justice Department's Criminal Division, again, as we've said, from 01 to 03, where he played a central role in the nation's legal response to the September 11th attacks before the President named him Appeals Court position in New Jersey.
[00:17:45.362 --> 00:17:47.803]  Bush was to formally announce Chertoff's election later.
[00:17:48.143 --> 00:17:51.785]  The White House, two government officials speaking in addition of anonymity, polled AP.
[00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:58.187]  Chertoff would replace Ridge at the department's first job, or chief job.
[00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:04.329]  Chertoff, who rounds out Bush's second term cabinet, was actually the president's second pick for the job.
[00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:13.193]  Former New York City Police Chief Bernard Carrick withdrew as nominee last month, citing immigration problems with his family housekeeper.
[00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:17.479]  No, you said you had a college degree and you didn't even graduate from high school.
[00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:24.201]  By the way, I don't think that not graduating from college or high school should bar you from a job.
[00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:32.764]  Most of your top CEOs and people didn't even go to college or high school, but I think lying about it should.
[00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:43.808]  After failing to disclose the nanny problem during an initial screening, Carrick acknowledged it during a subsequent vetting phase as he filled out
[00:18:44.588 --> 00:18:55.051]  A clearance form, the choice of a new Homeland Security Chief, completes a substantial makeover of the Bush team as the President awaits his swearing in January 20th for a new term.
[00:18:56.391 --> 00:19:01.552]  Donald H. Rumsfeld, Jon Snow, and Norman Mineta have remained as Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and Transportation.
[00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:04.493]  Folks, none of this even matters.
[00:19:04.713 --> 00:19:05.573]  They're all puppets.
[00:19:06.273 --> 00:19:12.235]  He turned to close associate Margaret Spellings and Alberto Gonzalez for positions of Secretary of Education and Attorney General.
[00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:17.629]  And shows his first-term National Security Advisor finally has arrived to be Secretary of State.
[00:19:19.931 --> 00:19:23.154]  Goes into Gonzales being quizzed aggressively, and that's an understatement.
[00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:25.456]  They basically worship him.
[00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:37.425]  About his role in writing of an administrative policy paper interpreting what kinds of interrogations of enemy combatants could be permitted under a 94 law banning torture.
[00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:58.759]  All right, we'll come back, take calls at 1-800-259-9231, get into a plethora of other news items, and play this clip about the Illuminati, the Hellfire Club, a Christian organization.
[00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:05.105]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:09.295]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:20:09.895 --> 00:20:13.437]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:20:14.097 --> 00:20:16.698]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:19.559]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:21.479]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.900]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.401]  Check with your doctor.
[00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:30.422]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:20:30.883 --> 00:20:31.783]  In all likelihood,
[00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:32.719]  We're good to go.
[00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:04.975]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:21:05.235 --> 00:21:06.336]  The real money folks.
[00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:11.538]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:12.899]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:13.539]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:13.959]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:16.941]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:19.222]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:30.862 --> 00:21:36.487]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:37.107 --> 00:21:40.150]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:27.036]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:27.456 --> 00:22:32.799]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:03.303]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:23:03.543 --> 00:23:03.864]  Why?
[00:23:03.884 --> 00:23:06.826]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?
[00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:11.849]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:23:11.989 --> 00:23:21.695]  The all-natural ingredients in Cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:23:48.715 --> 00:23:49.796]  I've got articles here.
[00:23:49.816 --> 00:23:50.957]  We're all over the country.
[00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:21.428]  License plate scanning cameras, the software that controls them are going in.
[00:24:21.448 --> 00:24:25.871]  It's going to be used for taxation, regulation, and quote, crime prevention.
[00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:28.793]  Let's say you got a warrant out for your arrest for not paying tickets.
[00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.915]  First time you get on the road, you'll be arrested.
[00:24:32.176 --> 00:24:34.197]  In the future, you're not a good globalist, of course.
[00:24:34.718 --> 00:24:36.259]  They'll be tracking and tracing you with that.
[00:24:37.314 --> 00:24:43.499]  All over the country, children are having to thumb scan to get school lunches and scan IDs, training you for the new casual society.
[00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:47.182]  These are the type of articles I've got today, and Greg Palast is coming up.
[00:24:47.662 --> 00:24:51.225]  And in the next segment, I'm going to play this Hellfire Club clip from the History Channel.
[00:24:51.766 --> 00:25:01.193]  Yeah, Ben Franklin's got some dead kids in his basement, and, you know, he likes Lucifer, but, you know, it's part of freedom, folks.
[00:25:02.174 --> 00:25:05.156]  Let's talk to Jack in Texas and Ian, Chris, and others.
[00:25:05.236 --> 00:25:06.237]  Jack, welcome.
[00:25:06.832 --> 00:25:08.773]  Yes, thanks for taking my call, Alex Jones.
[00:25:09.053 --> 00:25:14.495]  I've done a ton of research into Mr. Chertoff and thought I might share with you some of my findings.
[00:25:14.595 --> 00:25:16.716]  Oh, our new Homeland Security leader?
[00:25:17.217 --> 00:25:19.137]  Yeah, that's probably the plan all along.
[00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:27.121]  I believe that Bernie Carrick, the vetting of Bernie Carrick was just to kind of get some of the skeletons out of the closet of Mr. Rudy Giuliani so that he could run for president.
[00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:39.052]  In 2008, he's of course collecting a lot of cash to do that, but Mr. Chertoff, some of his esteemed awards include the Anti-Defamation League Distinguished Public Service Award in 92.
[00:25:39.893 --> 00:25:52.465]  He also was, because of his position, you have Robert Mueller from the FBI answering directly to him, and Michael Chertoff can be connected to the cover-up of the 911 whistleblowers.
[00:25:54.268 --> 00:26:04.354]  And now, of course, the establishment media says he is Clinton's nemesis, but that can also be looked at as he helped cover up the Whitewater Road law firm scandal.
[00:26:04.654 --> 00:26:07.675]  I mean, again, this is Jack Blood, Syndicate Talk Show, calling in.
[00:26:07.695 --> 00:26:09.877]  You're absolutely right, Jack, about Chertoff.
[00:26:09.957 --> 00:26:11.798]  I mean, it's a laundry list.
[00:26:11.858 --> 00:26:21.623]  He's the guy who helped implement a lot of this Christians are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists type stuff, and he's gotten awards for doing so.
[00:26:22.233 --> 00:26:33.225]  And, of course, you know, in the Orwellian world, his Department of Justice could be called the Department of Injustice, the Department of Justifying, as this is the fox watching the henhouse.
[00:26:33.265 --> 00:26:33.986]  Now, how about this?
[00:26:34.466 --> 00:26:41.915]  On Orrin Hatch's website, Mr. Chertoff successfully prosecuted a RICO murder case involving the third-ranking member of the Genovese
[00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:45.717]  Genovese La Cosa Nostra crime family for what?
[00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:47.578]  Trying to murder John Gotti.
[00:26:47.618 --> 00:26:52.340]  So he was covering up for John Gotti there and prosecuting John Gotti's competition.
[00:26:54.001 --> 00:27:00.024]  He's also covering up for international banksters with Swiss bank accounts.
[00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:08.288]  I mean, this is a perfect case of rewarding a globalist Zionist stooge for all of his service and good work.
[00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:10.329]  Well, I know that Mr. Chertoff
[00:27:13.001 --> 00:27:19.023]  Certainly is a globalist, and I think the meaning of his last name is very fitting in Russian.
[00:27:20.323 --> 00:27:26.585]  How do we end up with all these Russian guys in the head of Homeland Control Department, is what we have to start asking ourselves.
[00:27:26.605 --> 00:27:29.526]  Well, I mean, he's not as bad as the Silver Fox.
[00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:43.620]  The former head of the Stasi, being a consultant for Homeland Security, or General Primakov, or any of these people, whether it's Marcus Wolff or any of them, I mean, it's part of the new freedom, sir.
[00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:50.766]  Well, to quote Chair Toff, he says, two years into the war on terror, this was two years ago, it's time to move beyond the case-by-case development.
[00:27:51.006 --> 00:27:57.271]  They want sweeping police state changes to label us all terrorists, and you're exactly right.
[00:27:57.291 --> 00:28:00.033]  The prosecuting of homeschoolers, the prosecuting of
[00:28:00.593 --> 00:28:02.255]  Freedom-loving Americans everywhere.
[00:28:02.295 --> 00:28:07.279]  And if we look at this inauguration, I'm glad you're covering this story about the crosses being banned at the inauguration.
[00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:11.182]  Another perfect example of Chertoffian justice.
[00:28:12.663 --> 00:28:15.685]  I have all this on jackblood.com, a ton of stories.
[00:28:15.725 --> 00:28:17.867]  I've been doing hours worth of research into this guy.
[00:28:17.907 --> 00:28:21.130]  As soon as I heard his name, the bells all went off in my head, Alex.
[00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.750]  No, I know.
[00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.152]  We've been looking at Chertoff for a long, long time.
[00:28:24.192 --> 00:28:25.173]  He's a real piece of work.
[00:28:26.232 --> 00:28:26.933]  Well, carry on.
[00:28:26.993 --> 00:28:27.233]  Thanks.
[00:28:27.253 --> 00:28:28.534]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:28:28.634 --> 00:28:29.655]  I appreciate the call.
[00:28:30.215 --> 00:28:33.858]  Let's talk to Ian in New York, up there close to Lord Chertoff.
[00:28:33.898 --> 00:28:34.318]  Go ahead.
[00:28:34.338 --> 00:28:35.659]  Hi, thank you, Alex.
[00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:49.670]  Really quick, I didn't tell you the last couple times we called, but I have a radio station on my college radio, and basically go after your show and say a whole bunch of things that you say and, you know, tell the news.
[00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.274]  But anyways, really quick about the Illuminati and we have Bohemian Groves.
[00:28:54.787 --> 00:28:56.408]  You know the Grateful Dead?
[00:28:57.429 --> 00:28:58.709]  I guess they played over there.
[00:28:58.729 --> 00:29:03.252]  Yeah, the Wall Street Journal reported that this last summer the Grateful Dead were there.
[00:29:03.672 --> 00:29:07.534]  And I was surprised about this because I'm a Grateful Dead fan.
[00:29:07.654 --> 00:29:12.697]  And then they released the Grateful Dead movie and they have the all-seeing eye behind it.
[00:29:13.437 --> 00:29:19.481]  And then I look at other Grateful Dead stuff and there's Illuminati symbols all over that.
[00:29:19.661 --> 00:29:21.542]  And then I'm a Fish fan too.
[00:29:22.202 --> 00:29:23.523]  And I see like
[00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:25.680]  Sure you can.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.600]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.201]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:52.624]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:54.729]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.652 --> 00:29:58.339]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.831]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.891 --> 00:30:06.293]  Whether you were aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:30:06.653 --> 00:30:07.534]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:30:07.894 --> 00:30:09.115]  Oil War III has started.
[00:30:09.435 --> 00:30:11.876]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:15.679]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:30:16.099 --> 00:30:19.922]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:30:20.182 --> 00:30:21.443]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:26.386]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:30:26.806 --> 00:30:30.789]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:30:31.309 --> 00:30:37.212]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.

[00:31:03.323 --> 00:31:08.788]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:31:09.228 --> 00:31:13.773]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:31:13.893 --> 00:31:20.739]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:27.225]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:28.566]  There are no side effects.
[00:31:28.746 --> 00:31:29.227]  We're good to go.

[00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:04.843]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:10.528]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:32:10.808 --> 00:32:21.178]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:32:21.338 --> 00:32:25.682]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:32:25.862 --> 00:32:34.226]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:32:34.486 --> 00:32:40.849]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:32:40.969 --> 00:32:45.451]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:32:55.295 --> 00:32:59.437]  Alright, we're going back to Ian and Chris and Charles and others here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:29.622]  And then coming up, I'm going to have this clip off the History Channel about, oh, Benjamin Franklin did black masses.
[00:33:30.462 --> 00:33:33.383]  And Benjamin Franklin was in the Hellfire Club.
[00:33:34.824 --> 00:33:36.984]  Then I have the Times of London article here.
[00:33:37.085 --> 00:33:40.366]  Remains of ten bodies at Ben Franklin's home.
[00:33:42.486 --> 00:33:49.869]  Workmen have dug up the remains of ten bodies hidden beneath the former London home of Benjamin Franklin, the founding father of American independence.
[00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:53.150]  The remains of four adults and six children were discovered during...
[00:33:53.846 --> 00:34:01.594]  The 1.9 million pound restoration of Franklin's home at 36 Craven Street, close to Trafalgar Square.
[00:34:02.034 --> 00:34:06.519]  Researchers believe that there should be more bodies buried beneath the basement kitchens.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:11.384]  And later, yes, they did dig up more dating back from when he lived in the home.
[00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:24.156]  Initial estimates are the bodies are more than 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house which was his home from 1775 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775.
[00:34:24.816 --> 00:34:30.398]  Then of course he moved back to London of course after the Revolutionary War and died there.
[00:34:30.838 --> 00:34:35.160]  Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.961]  One skull has been drilled and several
[00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:44.344]  Holes Paul Kompfman, the Westminster coroner, said yesterday, I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime.
[00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:48.246]  There's still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.
[00:34:49.307 --> 00:34:53.389]  And some say, well, he could have been just dissecting bodies for medical purposes.
[00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.751]  And he was a devil worshipper on top of it, but, you know, they have rights too.
[00:35:00.012 --> 00:35:02.533]  The angel of death flying free, as they say.
[00:35:04.853 --> 00:35:06.034]  Very, very interesting.
[00:35:06.455 --> 00:35:14.282]  Folks, I don't know how any of you out there listening would not get my film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:15.103 --> 00:35:16.925]  It's the history of the secret society.
[00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:20.968]  The Skull and Bones arm, founded in 1972.
[00:35:21.089 --> 00:35:22.350]  Presidents attending since 1900.
[00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.933]  With Mr. Taft, the Skull and Bones are winning the first.
[00:35:26.654 --> 00:35:29.797]  I snuck in in July of 2000 with a hidden camera.
[00:35:30.689 --> 00:35:32.590]  We got the footage of the ritual.
[00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.991]  It is an amazing film.
[00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:36.072]  Two hours, five minutes long, $25.95.
[00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:40.715]  But if you get three or more of any of the titles, it drops down to $19.95.
[00:35:41.435 --> 00:35:45.818]  So on the three-tape special, that's an $18 discount on the three tapes.
[00:35:46.458 --> 00:35:49.240]  Why not get Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove?
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:58.745]  Show it to your pastor or your rabbi and say, why are our so-called conservative leaders engaging in this Moloch worship?
[00:35:59.565 --> 00:36:00.926]  I say, show it to your rabbi, too.
[00:36:00.946 --> 00:36:02.786]  Your rabbi will certainly know who Moloch is.
[00:36:02.846 --> 00:36:10.670]  It's all throughout the Old Testament and New Testament and the Talmud and other historical documents.
[00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.712]  Really, I mean, you need to have dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:36:16.732 --> 00:36:21.574]  You need to have 9-11, The Road to Tyranny to find out what really happened on 9-11 or Masters of Terror.
[00:36:21.594 --> 00:36:26.276]  You need to have George Humphrey's film, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.371]  Eric Huffman's video, 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[00:36:30.891 --> 00:36:31.871]  You need to have these.
[00:36:31.912 --> 00:36:35.273]  These are the preeminent works on September 11th.
[00:36:36.653 --> 00:36:49.937]  And I'm offering a discount right now to get my two 9-11 films, George Humphrey's 9-11 film, Eric Huffman's 9-11 film, and Paul Watson's 320-plus page book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor Terror and the New World Order, for $59.95.
[00:36:49.997 --> 00:36:51.438]  That's a $53 discount on the 9-11 special.
[00:36:55.894 --> 00:37:07.419]  And then on 9-11, the road to tyranny by itself, if you buy one copy, one copy for $24.95, it's almost three hours long, each additional copy, as many as you want, are $5.95.
[00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:10.441]  We're still offering this special.
[00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:14.683]  So buy four or five copies of it and give it as a gift.
[00:37:14.823 --> 00:37:16.323]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:37:16.783 --> 00:37:20.885]  The globalist criminals are going to keep getting away with their crimes until we expose them.
[00:37:21.346 --> 00:37:23.006]  And the mainstream media is not going to do it.
[00:37:23.026 --> 00:37:24.547]  It's up to you to get the word out.
[00:37:25.518 --> 00:37:29.700]  Folks, here is the toll-free number to call and get the videos.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.340]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.001]  Operators are there right now.
[00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:43.566]  You can call and ask about the other specials we're offering, too.

[00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:07.071]  1-888-253-3139, or just write to me.
[00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:14.294]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:14.874 --> 00:38:17.235]  And don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[00:38:18.275 --> 00:38:23.137]  All 11 of my films, dozens of other great films, going up in the next day or two.
[00:38:23.157 --> 00:38:27.198]  If it's not already up there, my webmaster told me it was going up this morning.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.341]  Muhammad Atta and the Venice Flying Circus, Getting Into the Hijackers, a great film.
[00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:35.842]  We've been authorized to post by its author.
[00:38:37.022 --> 00:38:39.043]  The Dean Haglin interview is going up.
[00:38:40.263 --> 00:38:45.165]  The 9-11 emergency release, a film I just offered for two months while I was making Road to Tyranny.
[00:38:45.185 --> 00:38:47.165]  It was something quick I put together, but it's excellent.
[00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:48.626]  Two hours long.
[00:38:48.686 --> 00:38:49.326]  That's going up.
[00:38:49.346 --> 00:38:52.907]  The only place you can watch it is at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:38:53.387 --> 00:38:54.927]  Fifteen cents a day, folks.
[00:38:55.487 --> 00:38:57.468]  A cup of coffee is a dollar on average.
[00:38:58.943 --> 00:39:00.405]  At Starbucks, it's more than that.
[00:39:00.485 --> 00:39:11.475]  So, you get a whole week for the price of a cup of coffee, and a whole month for the price of four cups of coffee.
[00:39:11.495 --> 00:39:13.517]  $5.95 a month.
[00:39:14.097 --> 00:39:16.980]  And if you get it for a year, it's even less per month.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.244]  But monthly and yearly subscriptions, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:39:21.324 --> 00:39:22.765]  Please take action.
[00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:24.547]  And if you already have my videos...
[00:39:26.534 --> 00:39:27.415]  Make copies of them.
[00:39:27.455 --> 00:39:28.336]  Get them out to people.
[00:39:28.416 --> 00:39:28.996]  Take action.
[00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:29.917]  It's having a big effect.
[00:39:30.238 --> 00:39:30.598]  All right.
[00:39:30.738 --> 00:39:32.720]  Ian in New York, then Chris Charles and others.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:41.227]  Ian, you were bringing up how you were a Grateful Dead fan, and then you saw in the Wall Street Journal where they went to the Bohemian Grove in July of 2004.
[00:39:42.048 --> 00:39:43.730]  Or at least that's where I heard about them going.
[00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.811]  You mentioned it.
[00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:47.513]  Where did you learn of the Grateful Dead going to Bohemian Grove?
[00:39:48.854 --> 00:39:52.678]  I heard about it in a letter that was written to Grateful Dead fans.
[00:39:53.408 --> 00:39:54.109]  Really?
[00:39:54.509 --> 00:39:55.149]  Yeah.
[00:39:55.509 --> 00:40:00.252]  It was a circulation letter.
[00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:04.335]  And then I looked at all the Illuminati symbols.
[00:40:04.755 --> 00:40:12.280]  They just released the Grateful Dead movie, and they have the great singing eye that's on the back of the dollar, the back of their DVD that they just released.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.122]  I'm like, tell my friend, isn't this kind of weird?
[00:40:15.462 --> 00:40:18.984]  And then we look at everything else, the Grateful Dead, there's a lot of symbols.
[00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.113]  It's the Illuminati symbol that they have on their record.
[00:40:24.074 --> 00:40:26.076]  It's everywhere, sir.
[00:40:26.096 --> 00:40:27.717]  This is the religion of the elite.
[00:40:27.737 --> 00:40:28.418]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:30.940]  Let's talk to Chris in Tennessee.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.821]  Chris, you're on the air.
[00:40:31.841 --> 00:40:33.482]  Hello, Alex.
[00:40:33.663 --> 00:40:37.026]  Alex, you're right about Michael Cherkoff, and so is Jack Blood.
[00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:39.628]  I urge everybody, it's time to act.
[00:40:39.848 --> 00:40:40.969]  Email the White House.
[00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.171]  They disapprove of this guy.
[00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:44.733]  Call the White House like I did.
[00:40:44.773 --> 00:40:45.513]  The phone number is 202-
[00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:50.492]  Well, if I was you, I wouldn't waste your time with the White House.
[00:40:50.652 --> 00:40:51.472]  I'd call Congress.
[00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:53.534]  Well, that's next as soon as I get done talking to you.
[00:40:53.554 --> 00:40:54.454]  Because this guy right here, good.
[00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:56.756]  He disowns the Constitution of the United States.
[00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:20.812]  And I'm telling you, people, look how the Patriot Act and other things have been unfolding.
[00:41:20.832 --> 00:41:24.715]  And they admit he's one of the architects, along with Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:41:24.935 --> 00:41:25.315]  Correct.
[00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:32.859]  And, people, if this is one thing that you... If you haven't done anything in your life, please do something.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.440]  Write or call the White House.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.601]  This guy is no good.
[00:41:36.421 --> 00:41:40.984]  And, Mr. Cherkov, I'm telling you to your face, if you're listening to this show, I disapprove of your nomination.
[00:41:41.004 --> 00:41:45.767]  I really don't care what you think of me, but I do not want you as the position of Homeland Security, officially.
[00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:46.970]  Note that.
[00:41:48.151 --> 00:41:48.972]  Disapprove of this.
[00:41:49.112 --> 00:41:50.974]  Well, I'm sure Mr. Chertoff is listening.
[00:41:51.134 --> 00:41:52.175]  I'm sure he is, too.
[00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:53.216]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:41:53.457 --> 00:41:53.997]  No, they are.
[00:41:54.017 --> 00:41:55.138]  Bye, Alex.
[00:41:55.719 --> 00:41:56.540]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.441]  I appreciate it, Chris.
[00:41:57.781 --> 00:41:59.483]  Charles in Louisiana.
[00:41:59.523 --> 00:42:00.444]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:42:02.666 --> 00:42:03.467]  Let's put him on hold.
[00:42:04.148 --> 00:42:04.909]  Let's put him on hold.
[00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:07.832]  He's got the radio turned up in the background.
[00:42:09.361 --> 00:42:13.062]  And again, I've been told it's been posted on Infowars.com.
[00:42:13.122 --> 00:42:24.926]  I watched the clip this morning of the History Channel blurb about the occult activities of Benjamin Franklin, and I'm told now that we do have that clip.
[00:42:24.946 --> 00:42:25.686]  Do you have that ready?
[00:42:27.227 --> 00:42:29.147]  Okay, let's go ahead and roll this.
[00:42:29.668 --> 00:42:30.748]  Listen carefully.
[00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:36.210]  This is History Channel throwing in your face what we talked about nine, ten years ago.
[00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:36.930]  Here it is.
[00:42:41.074 --> 00:42:45.096]  And a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of Hell.
[00:42:48.978 --> 00:43:03.405]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[00:43:03.485 --> 00:43:08.207]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[00:43:09.188 --> 00:43:15.373]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[00:43:17.334 --> 00:43:32.285]  All right, now I want to play that clip again, but I have the Times of London here in front of me with them digging up the dead bodies from his home where he lived, and the bodies are from the time that he lived there.
[00:43:33.425 --> 00:43:36.187]  And again, we already knew that Benjamin Franklin was involved in this.
[00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:38.449]  Go ahead and play the clip again.
[00:43:39.509 --> 00:43:45.955]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[00:43:49.819 --> 00:44:02.871]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[00:44:04.316 --> 00:44:09.080]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:15.206]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[00:44:17.528 --> 00:44:19.049]  All right, so there you have it.
[00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.772]  Let's go back to Charles now.
[00:44:22.872 --> 00:44:24.414]  Charles in Louisiana, go ahead.
[00:44:24.954 --> 00:44:26.556]  Mr. Jones, I just want to ask you an opinion.
[00:44:26.816 --> 00:44:30.179]  How long do you think we have until they really tighten up, really tighten up?
[00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:36.499]  I think you have until 666, and that'll be the middle of next year.
[00:44:36.519 --> 00:44:40.182]  666, the middle of next year.
[00:44:40.202 --> 00:44:42.004]  You know what the middle of next year is, right?
[00:44:42.364 --> 00:44:43.185]  What is that?
[00:44:43.625 --> 00:44:46.567]  It's the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year.
[00:44:46.868 --> 00:44:48.309]  You think that's when something's going to happen?
[00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.728]  You know, I don't like to make predictions.
[00:44:50.748 --> 00:44:53.551]  I occasionally make them, and unfortunately they've all come true.
[00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:58.176]  But I really, yeah, and again, I don't believe in this stuff, but the elite do.
[00:44:58.516 --> 00:44:59.016]  Yes, I understand.
[00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:05.063]  And again, on the morning of 9-11, there were all sorts of weird numerology going on.
[00:45:06.144 --> 00:45:22.138]  On the one-year anniversary of 9-11, the New York lottery came up 9-1-1, the Chicago Mercantile 9-1-1.000, they had TV shows about the government's going to hijack jets and fly it into buildings, the World Trade Center for Martial Law, you know, six months before.
[00:45:22.738 --> 00:45:26.622]  They do this, and the Madrid bombings were 911 days after 9-1-1 on 3-1-1.
[00:45:33.882 --> 00:45:38.206]  So, yes, sir, I really think they're going to pull something big on 666.
[00:45:38.346 --> 00:45:39.867]  It's next year.
[00:45:40.928 --> 00:45:50.336]  Well, I mean, you're asking, big stuff's obviously going to happen before then, but if I had to put a date on it, I think by 666 you're going to see something really big.
[00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:57.602]  Well, I just wanted to find out, you heard about Louisiana, home of Louisiana, six more Louisiana boys got killed in Bradley.
[00:45:58.743 --> 00:46:03.788]  Okay, you know, these boys in Iraq, I just don't know what to think of it anymore.
[00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:07.692]  It's just pathetic what they're putting our men through.
[00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:08.793]  You know?
[00:46:09.213 --> 00:46:10.434]  And the people are going to have to wake up.
[00:46:10.474 --> 00:46:12.016]  They're going to have all our boys shipped out.
[00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:13.978]  And then they're going to use foreign troops.
[00:46:14.018 --> 00:46:15.819]  Yeah, I really believe that's coming, Mr. Jones.
[00:46:15.879 --> 00:46:16.839]  I really believe it's coming.
[00:46:16.879 --> 00:46:26.404]  Well, the top brass scores of them have said in the last five years that if we're under attack by terrorists, we will use, quote, foreign assets to keep us safe.
[00:46:26.744 --> 00:46:28.705]  And they've been doing the drills all over the country.
[00:46:28.745 --> 00:46:29.085]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:29.626 --> 00:46:32.207]  And the troops that won't go along with it get shipped out of the nation.
[00:46:32.227 --> 00:46:36.549]  And no matter how crazy that sounds, that's really what they're gearing up to do.
[00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:39.231]  Do you think the American people will resist?
[00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:40.111]  Do you think they will?
[00:46:40.151 --> 00:46:41.652]  Well, that's what I'm worried about.
[00:46:42.344 --> 00:46:48.627]  Well, you see, it'll have to be a big enough disaster to where people just panic and lay down their rights and nuke going off smallpox.
[00:46:49.067 --> 00:46:51.908]  And the globalists say it's not a question of if but when, Charles.
[00:46:52.148 --> 00:46:52.488]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:53.229 --> 00:46:55.130]  What do you think of that Hellfire Club clip?
[00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:56.590]  It's unbelievable.
[00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:57.531]  Unbelievable.
[00:46:57.571 --> 00:46:59.852]  But you could expect it.
[00:46:59.992 --> 00:47:04.534]  Anything you say about them, it's just unbelievable.
[00:47:04.614 --> 00:47:07.255]  I mean, you don't think these people would be this gross, you know, but...
[00:47:08.064 --> 00:47:09.525]  I guess the American people want it.
[00:47:09.565 --> 00:47:10.846]  They're accepting all this.
[00:47:10.886 --> 00:47:13.608]  They took Christ out of school, Christ out of the courtrooms.
[00:47:13.949 --> 00:47:14.929]  Look what's happening to us.
[00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.230]  People better wake up.
[00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.272]  I just don't know what else to do, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:18.852 --> 00:47:20.194]  I just don't know what else to do.
[00:47:20.214 --> 00:47:21.735]  I'm so tired.
[00:47:22.115 --> 00:47:23.636]  I know you're tired because I'm tired.
[00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:26.098]  I'm so tired, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:26.979 --> 00:47:29.000]  But I'll keep trying, you know?
[00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:30.101]  I'll keep trying, sir.
[00:47:30.462 --> 00:47:32.223]  Well, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[00:47:32.263 --> 00:47:34.104]  Take care and understand your frustration.
[00:47:34.124 --> 00:47:35.966]  But it's always darkest before the dawn.
[00:47:37.717 --> 00:47:38.377]  Here's an article.
[00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:40.359]  Inauguration controversy widens.
[00:47:40.479 --> 00:47:45.162]  Crosses will be banned from this month's inaugural parade in Washington, D.C.
[00:47:45.742 --> 00:47:50.606]  January 20th presidential inauguration is causing controversy and religion is at the heart of the strife.
[00:47:50.626 --> 00:48:00.772]  Not only is the phrase, under God and the President's oath, under attack from an atheist who has filed suit to stop any papers from being said during the ceremony.
[00:48:01.493 --> 00:48:04.495]  Now crosses have been banned from the inauguration parade.
[00:48:04.855 --> 00:48:07.357]  Critics are calling it religious discrimination and censorship.
[00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:10.114]  And it goes on and on.
[00:48:10.234 --> 00:48:18.277]  Any group getting a permit to be part of the roads leading into it on the sidewalk or in the parade itself.
[00:48:20.238 --> 00:48:21.078]  No crosses.
[00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:26.500]  And no crates, coffins, cages, or statues.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:26.740]  See?
[00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:31.441]  I've heard the neocons on air going, I'm glad they're banning protests to Bush.
[00:48:31.762 --> 00:48:33.162]  I'm glad they're not giving them permits.
[00:48:33.223 --> 00:48:39.306]  I'm glad they're not letting them have the cardboard coffins to symbolize our dead tribes.
[00:48:39.527 --> 00:48:40.547]  They're a bunch of traitors.
[00:48:41.248 --> 00:48:45.651]  But see, you take their right away, now you've lost your right to have a cross.
[00:48:46.571 --> 00:48:48.813]  You see, you ban anything, then it's all banned.
[00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:55.457]  Why were crosses singled out over any other religious symbol?
[00:48:55.497 --> 00:48:57.078]  The Star of David, Islamic symbols...
[00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.710]  Pastor Mahoney said, This is offensive.
[00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.451]  It is, in my view, religious bigotry.
[00:49:02.031 --> 00:49:02.671]  Here's another one.
[00:49:02.691 --> 00:49:04.471]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:49:05.352 --> 00:49:07.332]  Bible removed from Houston Monument.
[00:49:07.352 --> 00:49:15.334]  A Bible was removed from a monument outside a downtown courthouse Monday while local officials appeal a federal judge's ruling that the display is unconstitutional.
[00:49:15.874 --> 00:49:23.295]  And again, the Attorney General of Alabama, who blocked Judge Roy Moore, has been rewarded by Bush with a high-level federal judgeship.
[00:49:24.896 --> 00:49:25.596]  And here's another one.
[00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:30.881]  Talking about the Christians facing 47 years in prison for praying.
[00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.603]  It says, The effort to silence Christians.
[00:49:34.623 --> 00:49:36.724]  We will shut you up, she muttered under her breath.
[00:49:36.784 --> 00:49:37.725]  Excuse me, I replied.
[00:49:37.745 --> 00:49:39.446]  Did you say something to me?
[00:49:40.026 --> 00:49:41.667]  She glared as she answered.
[00:49:41.787 --> 00:49:45.309]  One day we will absolutely shut you right-wing Christians up.
[00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.312]  The exchange took place approximately four years ago.
[00:49:49.352 --> 00:49:55.716]  It occurred following a debate over the promotion of homosexuality in a public education held at Portland, Oregon High School.
[00:49:57.242 --> 00:50:04.286]  And the article goes on, currently 5 of the 11 Christians are being charged four years later with seven crimes of convicted.
[00:50:04.326 --> 00:50:05.847]  They face 47 years in prison.
[00:50:06.207 --> 00:50:11.210]  It should also be noted that one of the five is a 17-year-old girl.
[00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:15.533]  This happened in Philadelphia, we talked about it a few weeks ago, so now they're getting what they want.
[00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:21.296]  And they say that praying on the sidewalk in a designated protest area...
[00:50:22.106 --> 00:50:28.968]  Saying that homosexuality is wrong is a hate crime and they face 47 years in prison.
[00:50:31.288 --> 00:50:33.188]  And they're going to ban anti-war protests.
[00:50:33.849 --> 00:50:35.729]  They're going to ban Second Amendment protests.
[00:50:36.709 --> 00:50:41.890]  No matter what group you're in or what side you're on, the left is all for silencing the right.
[00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.711]  The right is all for silencing the left.
[00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:45.051]  The globalists run both groups.
[00:50:45.371 --> 00:50:46.511]  You've lost your free speech.
[00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:49.652]  Unless we stand up and say no.
[00:50:51.992 --> 00:50:56.076]  Even if you don't like what somebody's saying, you should fight to the death to defend that right.
[00:50:56.717 --> 00:50:59.259]  More calls, more news straight ahead, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:51:00.842 --> 00:51:07.704]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.004 --> 00:51:09.385]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.565 --> 00:51:11.785]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:11.925 --> 00:51:14.026]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.286 --> 00:51:19.228]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.568 --> 00:51:23.589]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:23.849 --> 00:51:24.670]  We're good to go.
[00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:25.050]  I think?
[00:51:47.568 --> 00:51:48.429]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:51:54.918 --> 00:51:55.639]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.399 --> 00:52:00.999]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:01.119 --> 00:52:02.000]  Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.262]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:06.402 --> 00:52:09.263]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:09.363 --> 00:52:16.087]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.247 --> 00:52:19.268]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:19.468 --> 00:52:21.870]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:26.692]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[00:52:26.892 --> 00:52:41.485]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:41.605 --> 00:52:48.311]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[00:52:55.016 --> 00:52:58.237]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[00:53:16.625 --> 00:53:17.005]  Thank you.
[00:53:32.136 --> 00:53:32.636]  We're good to go.
[00:53:32.656 --> 00:53:32.957]  I think?
[00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:15.055]  Your founding father engaged in black masses.
[00:54:15.595 --> 00:54:17.977]  They dug up dead children in his house.
[00:54:18.938 --> 00:54:19.899]  But he's good.
[00:54:20.939 --> 00:54:23.241]  The report goes on to say he's good.
[00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:25.243]  These are really the good people.
[00:54:25.263 --> 00:54:27.764]  They made deals with hell.
[00:54:27.784 --> 00:54:31.227]  In fact, I want to play that clip one more time and we'll go to your calls.
[00:54:31.627 --> 00:54:35.090]  This is the History Channel flaunting in your face what we already knew.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.322]  The question is, why is it all coming out now?
[00:54:38.382 --> 00:54:39.723]  Why is it all being admitted?
[00:54:40.123 --> 00:54:40.723]  Go ahead and hit it.
[00:54:41.484 --> 00:54:47.928]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[00:54:51.791 --> 00:55:04.980]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[00:55:06.275 --> 00:55:11.037]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[00:55:11.557 --> 00:55:18.140]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[00:55:19.721 --> 00:55:21.581]  An occasional participant?
[00:55:22.882 --> 00:55:25.103]  All right, we'll go ahead and cut that clip now.
[00:55:27.864 --> 00:55:30.585]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:55:31.917 --> 00:55:37.541]  Let's talk to Fred in Connecticut, up there by Skull and Bones Country, where they do the exact same things today.
[00:55:38.182 --> 00:55:39.603]  Part of the Christian conservatism.
[00:55:39.623 --> 00:55:40.643]  Go ahead, Fred.
[00:55:41.384 --> 00:55:42.365]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[00:55:43.065 --> 00:55:44.286]  I've got a question for you.
[00:55:45.287 --> 00:55:51.351]  Every day I hear about the reports coming in of the troops in Iraq and so many getting killed.
[00:55:52.092 --> 00:55:58.276]  And I made an observation about this, and I'm wondering, how come none of our troops are ever shot, ever killed by gunfire?
[00:55:58.356 --> 00:56:00.898]  Everybody's killed by an RPG or a roadside bomb.
[00:56:01.707 --> 00:56:03.968]  Are they trying to say that the Iraqis can't shoot?
[00:56:04.288 --> 00:56:10.271]  I can't imagine 1,300 of our people being killed, and it's appalling, and nobody's being shot.
[00:56:10.612 --> 00:56:12.212]  Well, some of them have been shot.
[00:56:12.232 --> 00:56:19.536]  I don't have the numbers in front of me, but you're right to say most of it is rocket-propelled grenades and improvised munitions.
[00:56:20.056 --> 00:56:20.817]  Nobody's ever shot.
[00:56:20.857 --> 00:56:22.718]  They never say, oh, they were shot and killed.
[00:56:23.098 --> 00:56:25.999]  Actually, quite a few were shot, but it is the minority.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.901]  I've talked to families that's been over there, talked to others,
[00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:29.701]  Uh-huh.
[00:56:52.446 --> 00:56:54.347]  Plus, usually they're in light armor.
[00:56:54.807 --> 00:56:58.388]  And so it takes... And they're also wearing body armor.
[00:56:58.408 --> 00:57:03.390]  A lot of them get shot in the helmets, shot in the chest plates of their level 3 body armor.
[00:57:05.251 --> 00:57:07.732]  Okay, but I thought this was kind of strange.
[00:57:07.772 --> 00:57:11.653]  Plus, you don't usually hear about... They don't give you details of injuries.
[00:57:11.713 --> 00:57:12.794]  People are getting shot.
[00:57:13.114 --> 00:57:13.434]  It's just...
[00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:21.120]  This is the highest level of people surviving this war because of advanced medical treatments and high-tech body armor.
[00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:23.822]  People are being shot, they're just not dying a lot from it.
[00:57:24.243 --> 00:57:26.925]  Okay, we could solve all of this stuff if they'd bring them all home.
[00:57:27.685 --> 00:57:29.467]  Let the Iraqis fend for themselves.
[00:57:30.183 --> 00:57:31.765]  But we have to liberate them, sir.
[00:57:32.045 --> 00:57:32.786]  We have to liberate them.
[00:57:32.806 --> 00:57:34.087]  Our government put Saddam in.
[00:57:34.107 --> 00:57:34.728]  He was bad.
[00:57:35.048 --> 00:57:36.910]  Our government told him to invade all these countries.
[00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:41.354]  So we have to get him out of there and put the Baptists back in to start the whole thing over again.
[00:57:41.615 --> 00:57:43.617]  Why are we shoving democracy down their throats?
[00:57:43.677 --> 00:57:44.477]  Maybe they don't want it.
[00:57:44.517 --> 00:57:48.441]  They've lived under their tribal laws for centuries, and now all of a sudden they have to have democracy?
[00:57:48.521 --> 00:57:49.803]  Well, it's not even democracy.
[00:57:49.843 --> 00:57:53.226]  I mean, no one's running against Alawi.
[00:57:53.526 --> 00:57:53.847]  Yes.
[00:57:54.925 --> 00:58:01.087]  And then when it came out that no one's running against him because they're afraid to be killed, they said, well, people are really running, but it's going to be a secret election.
[00:58:01.368 --> 00:58:03.388]  You won't know who the candidates are until Election Day.
[00:58:05.129 --> 00:58:05.549]  Very good.
[00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:06.650]  Thank you very much, sir.
[00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:07.650]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.391]  I mean, it's just incredible, folks.
[00:58:10.951 --> 00:58:19.134]  Our government, those that own our government, our puppet government, installed 300-plus regional leaders about a year and a half ago.
[00:58:19.754 --> 00:58:22.295]  And now they're going to have the election coming up here in about 20 days.
[00:58:26.046 --> 00:58:26.487]  19 days.
[00:58:28.188 --> 00:58:31.470]  And it's just a joke.
[00:58:32.251 --> 00:58:33.171]  It's a total joke.
[00:58:33.912 --> 00:58:36.213]  The place has descended into hellfire.
[00:58:37.354 --> 00:58:39.235]  I guess a place Benjamin Franklin would like.
[00:58:39.896 --> 00:58:42.598]  Benjamin Franklin, British trader, inside agent.
[00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:44.699]  Thought you might want to know that.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.761]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:47.621 --> 00:58:48.782]  Another Benedict Arnold.
[00:58:51.184 --> 00:58:51.404]  Hello!
[00:58:57.292 --> 00:58:57.952]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.613 --> 00:58:59.673]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.373 --> 00:59:01.453]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:02.973]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.714 --> 00:59:04.594]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.614 --> 00:59:09.195]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.455 --> 00:59:13.596]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.216 --> 00:59:17.577]  Alright, my friends, the 11th day of January 2005.
[00:59:17.817 --> 00:59:18.897]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:18.917 --> 00:59:19.217]  We've got
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:43.725]  Award-winning, best-selling author, BBC News night investigative journalist, who's an American, by the way, Greg Palast, have him on every four or five months, joining us just to talk about all the latest news developments and his incredible DVD, The Bush Family Fortunes, just getting into who these individuals really are.
[00:59:45.886 --> 00:59:49.987]  And I also want to talk about Mr. Chertoff to be our new Homeland Security leader.
[00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:56.512]  Involved in the Homeland Security legislation, involved in all the police state activities.
[00:59:57.153 --> 01:00:02.655]  Also want to talk about the war in general, and take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:02.675 --> 01:00:08.238]  But joining us, again, is Greg Palast of gregpalast.com.
[01:00:08.778 --> 01:00:19.823]  Again, writes for major magazines and publications, newspapers, BBC News Night, investigative journalist, best-selling author of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, and the new, incredible DVD that I'm a big fan of,
[01:00:20.838 --> 01:00:24.660]  And that DVD, of course, is the Bush family fortunes.
[01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:26.981]  Greg, good to have you on with us.
[01:00:27.141 --> 01:00:27.802]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:27.842 --> 01:00:32.804]  Glad to be back with you on a dark day for American journalism.
[01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:43.349]  We had the purge now at CBS of reporters who dared challenge the great war record of George Bush.
[01:00:46.462 --> 01:00:57.505]  The reporters that did the story on Bush as a draft dodger during the war, the producers, Mary Mapes and three others, lost their jobs.
[01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:01.126]  They were chucked over the side.
[01:01:01.226 --> 01:01:11.508]  They were the scapegoats for... Basically, you could just smell the White House in this... Well, yeah, it's like Karl Rove planting fake bugs and then calling his FBI buddy...
[01:01:12.528 --> 01:01:17.249]  And the bug has a two-hour battery and there was an hour left on its power supply.
[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:30.112]  You know, one of the things is that, just for those who don't know, if you actually see the film Bush Family Fortunes, you will see the original story on which the CBS story is based.
[01:01:30.693 --> 01:01:40.235]  Which is, unless you've been hiding in a rock, you know that George Bush, that Daddy Bush, was able to make a call
[01:01:41.232 --> 01:01:54.684]  Through Ben Barnes, the Speaker of the House, later Lieutenant Governor of Texas, to get his sonny boy out of the war in Vietnam, while Congressman George Bush Sr.
[01:01:55.124 --> 01:02:01.009]  and Senator Prescott Bush were voting to send other men's sons to Vietnam.
[01:02:01.604 --> 01:02:07.589]  They are working on getting their own Sonny Boy into the nice position of guarding Houston from Viet Cong attack.
[01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:17.798]  Now, again, for those that just joined us, what happened here is the report of him being AWOL, all of this has been documented and proven, but what they do is they then bring in some false info.
[01:02:18.138 --> 01:02:18.919]  It's a little, yeah.
[01:02:19.159 --> 01:02:20.220]  And try to discredit the whole thing.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.781]  It's the same thing with Hatfield's Fortunate Son.
[01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:29.184]  Out of a huge book, they find one thing that's a little off, and then the media focuses on that and tries to discredit it.
[01:02:29.424 --> 01:02:32.146]  What we do know is that this guy was washed out.
[01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.726]  He wouldn't take the drug test.
[01:02:34.026 --> 01:02:39.369]  He was disappearing for years on end, and he was in a silver spoon fighter wing.
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:47.013]  Well, you know, I have to tell you that one of the things that happened was that the main story that a call was made
[01:02:48.587 --> 01:02:54.628]  By the Bush family to get little George out of the war in Vietnam.
[01:02:55.248 --> 01:02:58.649]  I ran that story in 1999 in The Guardian.
[01:02:59.829 --> 01:03:03.270]  And in Bush Family Fortunes, we take it further.
[01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:04.550]  We show you the documentation.
[01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:07.071]  Stuff that Dan Rather didn't, by the way, have.
[01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:08.791]  That the fix was in.
[01:03:09.731 --> 01:03:12.432]  He had Ben Barnes on who confessed to making the deal.
[01:03:13.152 --> 01:03:13.892]  To cutting the deal.
[01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:17.073]  That I had those documents too.
[01:03:17.213 --> 01:03:18.313]  What was added...
[01:03:19.577 --> 01:03:32.601]  ...was a lieutenant, Colonel Burkett, who is there in Texas, who was witness to the destruction of documents to the purging of... But you notice CBS didn't focus in on that.
[01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:33.381]  This is how they do it.
[01:03:33.701 --> 01:03:36.402]  They focus in on something on purpose to discredit it.
[01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:37.423]  Stay there, Greg.
[01:03:37.443 --> 01:03:39.343]  I want to get into this new Chertoff guy.
[01:03:39.363 --> 01:03:41.424]  I want to talk about the election itself.
[01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:43.826]  Carrie taking the dive.
[01:03:44.247 --> 01:03:46.088]  I want to talk about all of it and take calls.
[01:03:46.128 --> 01:03:50.632]  There's so much to discuss with Greg Palast and what you think Bush is going to do in the future.
[01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:57.137]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.317 --> 01:04:01.741]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:06.265]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:07.646]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.418 --> 01:04:13.641]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:13.701 --> 01:04:20.645]  We rip the Senator-Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:20.765 --> 01:04:22.827]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.147 --> 01:04:33.594]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:33.774 --> 01:04:35.915]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:04:38.217 --> 01:04:40.399]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:52.472 --> 01:05:03.220]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:10.986]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:14.368]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:14.528 --> 01:05:14.908]  We're good to go.
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:39.144]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:39.364 --> 01:05:43.306]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.913]  SuperSilver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[01:06:16.357 --> 01:06:29.191]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:35.838]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:06:57.344 --> 01:06:58.024]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.664 --> 01:06:59.745]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.425 --> 01:07:01.565]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.205 --> 01:07:03.045]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:04.526]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:08.986]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.506 --> 01:07:13.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:13.827 --> 01:07:19.528]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:07:20.128 --> 01:07:24.148]  Now eight minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:24.168 --> 01:07:32.550]  We're joined by, again, award-winning investigative journalist with Newsnight BBC, best-selling author...
[01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:39.513]  Greg Palast and his DVD is amazing.
[01:07:39.553 --> 01:07:41.034]  It's Bush Family Fortunes.
[01:07:41.094 --> 01:07:42.174]  It's all documented.
[01:07:42.634 --> 01:07:43.895]  None of it has been challenged.
[01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:45.996]  And it's available by calling.
[01:07:46.056 --> 01:07:46.736]  Here's the number.
[01:07:46.776 --> 01:07:47.517]  I want you to get it.
[01:07:47.537 --> 01:07:47.637]  877-300-7645.
[01:07:47.657 --> 01:07:47.877]  877-300-7645.
[01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:49.838]  We'll give that out to you a little bit later.
[01:07:49.878 --> 01:07:52.919]  And yes, Mike in Illinois, Louis, Pat, Charles, your calls are all coming up.
[01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:09.779]  Greg Palast, I want to cover a whole host of issues and get your insight, pun intended, into it.
[01:08:10.539 --> 01:08:16.361]  But getting back into Bush and the National Guard, look, I'm nonpartisan.
[01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:17.882]  I wasn't for Kerry or Bush.
[01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:21.083]  But we can't have a double standard here.
[01:08:21.603 --> 01:08:25.424]  Bush really was in the silver spoon, arrowing.
[01:08:26.245 --> 01:08:27.945]  It's admitted that he was AWOL.
[01:08:28.865 --> 01:08:33.147]  It's admitted that he wouldn't take drug tests, physicals.
[01:08:34.563 --> 01:08:36.525]  None of that, as you've said, has been debated.
[01:08:36.785 --> 01:08:39.628]  Then they bring in some false info, trying to discredit the whole story.
[01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:50.179]  No one has refuted the documents and the eyewitnesses and the colonels and all of them that you've interviewed for your film, Bush Family Fortunes.
[01:08:50.199 --> 01:08:55.404]  And that's just a small part of the film, showing this hypocrisy as Bush Sr.
[01:08:55.444 --> 01:08:56.946]  sending young men off to war.
[01:08:59.027 --> 01:09:02.588]  Why didn't CBS go back and show all of this and defend themselves?
[01:09:02.989 --> 01:09:03.789]  Well, it's pretty simple.
[01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:05.970]  CBS is owned by the same war machine.
[01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:07.870]  They wanted to discredit this story.
[01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:10.411]  I want to speak just a few more minutes on that.
[01:09:10.471 --> 01:09:21.935]  Then I want to get into Mr. Chertoff to be our new Homeland Security head, what you thought of Bernard Carrick, what you think of Alberto, I love torture, Bush is above the law, Gonzalez, just a whole host of issues.
[01:09:21.975 --> 01:09:23.916]  But finish up with your...
[01:09:24.896 --> 01:09:28.999]  Take on what's happened with this whole CBS shake-up.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.882]  George Bush is a draft dodger.
[01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:38.887]  So we had this Lieutenant Colonel Burkett of the Texas Air Guard who saw the destruction of documents.
[01:09:39.007 --> 01:09:41.569]  I'm reading this CBS report.
[01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:44.671]  It says, oh, that Burkett was challenged.
[01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:45.692]  Well, of course he was challenged.
[01:09:45.732 --> 01:09:47.914]  Karl Rove doesn't admit anything.
[01:09:48.674 --> 01:09:49.695]  But there's no evidence.
[01:09:50.115 --> 01:09:50.656]  I couldn't get...
[01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:55.616]  For BBC Television, you'll see that we have Burkett making these charges.
[01:09:55.936 --> 01:09:58.017]  We couldn't get the White House to say, no, that's false.
[01:09:58.118 --> 01:09:59.098]  Actually, no one challenged it.
[01:09:59.118 --> 01:10:03.482]  We had no official challenge saying, this is wrong, it ain't so.
[01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:08.703]  Took one document that we don't even know is inauthentic.
[01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:11.925]  We have no idea what the deal is, but it's a very sideways issue.
[01:10:11.945 --> 01:10:19.609]  It has not a darn thing to do with whether one, the fix was in for Bush to get out of Vietnam, which is proven.
[01:10:19.929 --> 01:10:21.970]  Whether Bush went AWOL, which is proven.
[01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:27.713]  Whether Bush got out of an order to pee into a jar to take a drug test.
[01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:29.554]  We know he did that and lost his wings.
[01:10:30.315 --> 01:10:30.935]  You know, I mean...
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.620]  All this stuff is proven.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.161]  The basic story that CBS ran was absolutely proven.
[01:10:36.181 --> 01:10:41.702]  They had this little sideways thing about some special privileges he may have gotten, which are mentioned in the document.
[01:10:42.142 --> 01:10:52.184]  They take questions about this one sideways, who cares document, and they destroy Dan Rather, they destroy any investigative reporting.
[01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:56.725]  Now, Dan Rather is not exactly a front-line guy in terms of investigative reporting.
[01:10:57.185 --> 01:10:58.045]  And he told me,
[01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:11.724]  On my show, that is the show that handles my reports for BBC Television Newsnight, he told another reporter, look, if I were to ask tough questions about George Bush and the war, I would be lynched.
[01:11:12.345 --> 01:11:13.525]  And that's what happened to him.
[01:11:13.926 --> 01:11:16.868]  He knew that if he ever stepped out of line, his career was toast.
[01:11:17.248 --> 01:11:19.450]  He stepped out of line, his career is toast.
[01:11:20.571 --> 01:11:23.813]  And, you know, I've got to tell you, this woman, Mary Mapes,
[01:11:25.049 --> 01:11:33.234]  CBS, when I did the stories that ran all over the world about the 6th of the 2000 election, CBS would not run the story.
[01:11:33.514 --> 01:11:40.278]  But there is one producer at CBS who stood up and said, we should run this story, and that's Mary Mates, the woman that was just canned.
[01:11:40.598 --> 01:11:49.683]  She's the one, by the way, who insisted and was able to get on the air the story of the torture at the prison in Iraq, at Abu Ghraib.
[01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:51.404]  So, you know, what happens is that there's
[01:11:51.815 --> 01:11:56.036]  Within these news organizations, there's a lot of people who really want to do investigative reporting.
[01:11:56.416 --> 01:12:02.277]  The minute that they actually do it, they get absolutely crushed by the powers that be.
[01:12:02.357 --> 01:12:04.258]  And I don't care whether it's Democratic or Republican.
[01:12:04.498 --> 01:12:11.979]  Let me tell you, you notice that no one lost their job for reporting this hokey business about Saddam having weapons of mass destruction.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.380]  Which they said was guaranteed and documented literally hundreds of times.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.781]  Yeah, you know, I mean, come on.
[01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.001]  You know, I mean, these guys, you know...
[01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:23.745]  Did anyone at CBS lose their job because they repeated Dick Cheney's lie?
[01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:32.171]  Now, I want to go back here for a second and show the public weapons dossiers written 12 years ago by alcoholic graduate students.
[01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:48.825]  But the point here is, why this is important, time and time again we see Roe, who's been caught doing stuff like this, in the middle of a real story, they will plant something small and manufactured to then run and discredit that and focus everyone in on that.
[01:12:49.838 --> 01:12:50.838]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:12:50.878 --> 01:12:54.080]  So what's happening is that they do this smear campaign.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:00.202]  And by the way, the guys that they had do the hit, okay, for CBS, they had a so-called investigation.
[01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:05.745]  They might as well have appointed Karl Rove to do the hit or just have Dick Cheney say, here's the reporters I don't like.
[01:13:05.985 --> 01:13:09.907]  They used Dickie Thornburg, who was George Bush Sr.'
[01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:10.687]  's Attorney General.
[01:13:10.827 --> 01:13:11.927]  A little conflict, isn't there?
[01:13:11.967 --> 01:13:12.428]  Hey, buddy.
[01:13:13.148 --> 01:13:17.770]  The other is we also had this guy, Bacardi,
[01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.253]  From Associated Press.
[01:13:19.273 --> 01:13:28.516]  Now, he's the guy who spiked the stories on the Iran-Contra scandal, giving weapons to the Ayatollah.
[01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:32.277]  He not only knew about it, he was involved in it.
[01:13:32.577 --> 01:13:36.578]  He was involved secretly, Bacardi, with Ali North.
[01:13:37.145 --> 01:13:45.252]  When his own reporters started sniffing around, he spiked their stories and basically were shoved out of AP and lost their jobs.
[01:13:45.352 --> 01:13:53.259]  So these are the guys who then ran CBS's investigation, and then CBS goes, oops, we were wrong.
[01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:54.239]  Classic.
[01:13:54.259 --> 01:13:56.141]  So they have staged investigations.
[01:13:56.281 --> 01:13:57.142]  A staged deal.
[01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:01.405]  And the firm that they use, the law firm of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart, that's Bob Dole's operation.
[01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:04.308]  It's a lobbying outfit for the backup companies and for the Bush boys.
[01:14:04.528 --> 01:14:05.748]  All right, let me stop you right there.
[01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:07.949]  I want to cover a whole host of issues.
[01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:29.314]  Let's talk right now about the big story of the so-called conservative commentator Armstrong Williams getting $240,000 to run around as a front man as if it was his own idea promoting the No Child Left Independent, I mean No Child Left Behind giant federal takeover plan.
[01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:34.035]  Actually, the proper name for it is No Child Behind Left.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.302]  Now, but let me stop you right there.
[01:14:37.743 --> 01:14:40.446]  I want to ask you just a couple other caveats to that question.
[01:14:41.387 --> 01:14:47.294]  We know about the 70 plus million paid into fake newscasts aired all over the country.
[01:14:48.473 --> 01:14:49.574]  We're good to go.
[01:15:11.144 --> 01:15:12.945]  That's why I don't work in the U.S.
[01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:15.446]  I mean, I'm basically investigative reporters.
[01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:17.848]  They're just basically banned from the airways of the U.S.
[01:15:17.948 --> 01:15:29.334]  The film Bush Family Fortunes, which I understand they can get from you, had to be done by a British broadcasting corporation out of Britain because we couldn't get this stuff on the air in America.
[01:15:29.374 --> 01:15:33.837]  In fact, I have to tell you that a Time Warner executive said, Greg, we love your stuff.
[01:15:33.857 --> 01:15:35.518]  Why don't you do something a little less controversial?
[01:15:36.502 --> 01:15:43.228]  We're not going to run this because Time Warner would never let us run this film about the Bush family.
[01:15:44.389 --> 01:15:47.972]  And that's, you know, I mean, so they even say it right up front.
[01:15:48.392 --> 01:15:49.433]  We can't run this stuff.
[01:15:49.473 --> 01:15:52.436]  We don't care whether it's true, whether it's false, whether it's anything.
[01:15:52.856 --> 01:15:54.578]  We are not going to take that chance.
[01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.449]  All right.
[01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:59.554]  And because you mentioned, again, I'm not carrying Bush Family Fortunes.
[01:15:59.694 --> 01:16:00.675]  The network is.
[01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:01.596]  I asked them to.
[01:16:02.998 --> 01:16:05.020]  And I really want people to call.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.623]  And this supports the network itself and what we're doing.
[01:16:07.683 --> 01:16:08.584]  It's a great work.
[01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:09.946]  Give them a call.
[01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:10.006]  877-376-45.
[01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:14.831]  877-300-7645.
[01:16:15.012 --> 01:16:19.657]  Give the network a call.
[01:16:20.057 --> 01:16:22.580]  They've got folks there right now to take your order, send it out to you.
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:26.103]  It is a great, professionally produced piece.
[01:16:26.804 --> 01:16:31.529]  Basically, an amalgamation with some added material from BBC reports that Greg did.
[01:16:31.549 --> 01:16:31.569]  877-
[01:16:33.992 --> 01:16:43.462]  37645, or go to GCNlive.com, and then click on the banner for the GCN store, and it's right there amongst a bunch of other great works.
[01:16:43.482 --> 01:16:43.782]  877-37645.
[01:16:43.822 --> 01:16:52.411]  Yeah, before we get into other areas of this, tell folks predominantly, give us kind of a thumbnail sketch of the film.
[01:16:53.031 --> 01:17:00.357]  Well, we not only have Bush the draft dodger, we have how the fix was done in the last election, which was repeated this time.
[01:17:01.238 --> 01:17:03.900]  We have the real story of the war in Iraq.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:14.049]  I have an exclusive interview with General Jay Garner, kind of our first pasha that we put installed there, who said he wouldn't go along with plans to carve up the oil fields.
[01:17:14.867 --> 01:17:17.368]  Which required us to have a long and brutal occupation.
[01:17:17.388 --> 01:17:19.790]  Yeah, his quote was, we're not here for your oil.
[01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:23.712]  And he was actually there trying to get them on our side and wanted to get the power back on.
[01:17:23.732 --> 01:17:24.872]  And they said, buddy, you're fired.
[01:17:25.152 --> 01:17:25.593]  That's right.
[01:17:25.753 --> 01:17:30.315]  Rumsfeld had him fired because he said, look, give them elections in nine days, we're out of here.
[01:17:30.735 --> 01:17:31.396]  We're out of here.
[01:17:32.096 --> 01:17:33.457]  You know, you have to realize.
[01:17:33.537 --> 01:17:34.838]  He believed the propaganda.
[01:17:35.338 --> 01:17:36.498]  Yeah, he thought he was supposed to.
[01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:39.320]  He said, I was told that we were supposed to create democracy and get out of here.
[01:17:41.409 --> 01:17:42.130]  Get in, get out.
[01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:46.617]  If we followed his schedule, there are more than 1,000 Americans who have died
[01:17:53.926 --> 01:18:01.869]  After the date that Garner set for us leaving, and they fired him because they said, nah, we got this thing, and we're going to shake it till the oil, till we can squeeze all the oil out.
[01:18:01.889 --> 01:18:03.370]  And by the way, it's just like Vietnam.
[01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:04.930]  They don't want things to get better.
[01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:07.551]  They want it to be a big cash machine for weapon sales.
[01:18:07.752 --> 01:18:12.093]  Well, and furthermore, you've got the problem that it's pretty hard to be a war president without a war.
[01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:21.197]  And if you remember, that Rove has indicated that the big mistake of Daddy Bush won, and the reason why he lost his re-election is that
[01:18:21.874 --> 01:18:25.716]  You know, the war ended too quickly in Iraq back in 92.
[01:18:26.217 --> 01:18:28.438]  And the film covers a lot of other key areas.
[01:18:28.899 --> 01:18:41.527]  Yep, you got Enron, you got the whole money game, you know, how the Bush family cashed in on the oil industry, and particularly you have the connection between the Bush family and the bin Laden.
[01:18:41.547 --> 01:18:43.508]  Powerful film, 877-300-7645.
[01:18:43.528 --> 01:18:45.569]  The network is carrying it because I recommend it.
[01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:47.510]  All right, we're going to come back.
[01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:50.652]  I want to get into all these new people Bush is putting into his cabinet.
[01:18:51.213 --> 01:18:51.593]  Stay with us.

[01:20:58.391 --> 01:21:02.534]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:02.975 --> 01:21:03.795]  So what do you do?
[01:21:04.116 --> 01:21:08.679]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:09.179 --> 01:21:11.300]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:21:11.781 --> 01:21:26.510]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:21:51.877 --> 01:21:57.740]  Hey, I'll tell you, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.500]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[01:21:59.741 --> 01:22:01.621]  Hey, last weekend, I helped my neighbor move.
[01:22:01.902 --> 01:22:03.662]  It took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[01:22:03.982 --> 01:22:07.744]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:11.066]  And then after that, I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[01:22:11.206 --> 01:22:11.406]  Wow.
[01:22:12.066 --> 01:22:16.188]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[01:22:16.488 --> 01:22:17.068]  Well, that's great.
[01:22:17.128 --> 01:22:19.929]  And just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in collagenate.
[01:22:19.989 --> 01:22:20.209]  Right.
[01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:22.030]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants.
[01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:25.131]  It's more that because you've lost weight, you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[01:22:25.331 --> 01:22:25.731]  Absolutely.
[01:22:25.771 --> 01:22:26.611]  I'm sleeping better.
[01:22:26.892 --> 01:22:28.072]  I feel better during the day.
[01:22:28.092 --> 01:22:29.793]  I don't get as tired in the afternoons.
[01:22:29.933 --> 01:22:31.193]  And I'm able to do a lot more.
[01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:32.374]  Collagenate is safe.
[01:22:32.534 --> 01:22:33.174]  It's natural.
[01:22:33.274 --> 01:22:33.794]  It's healthy.
[01:22:33.914 --> 01:22:36.015]  And it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.
[01:22:36.175 --> 01:22:42.117]  Call and order Vim and Vigorous Collagenate 1-800-622-THEN.
[01:22:42.137 --> 01:22:42.477]  800-622-8446.
[01:22:44.098 --> 01:22:46.439]  You'll get $25 off your first three-month order.
[01:22:46.739 --> 01:22:49.540]  Order Vim and Vigorous Collagenate 1-800-622-8446.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:23:01.424]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:04.965]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.459 --> 01:23:15.062]  By the way, the Bush Family Fortunes, the DVD is only $12.95, my friends.
[01:23:15.982 --> 01:23:16.722]  And well worth it.
[01:23:16.822 --> 01:23:19.743]  Again, that number, 877-376-45.
[01:23:20.063 --> 01:23:24.345]  Or at GCNlive.com, go to the store.
[01:23:25.185 --> 01:23:30.367]  Greg, I know there's a lot of topics you want to go over, and we're going to take calls coming up in the next segment, I promise, for the listeners.
[01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:35.069]  But right now, things are really getting obvious.
[01:23:35.109 --> 01:23:37.630]  They just passed a shadow government law yesterday.
[01:23:39.337 --> 01:23:45.825]  For total martial law control, they've passed the national ID card a few weeks ago.
[01:23:45.925 --> 01:23:50.711]  Bush and the New Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing of every American child.
[01:23:50.731 --> 01:23:53.295]  I mean, how can this be called conservative?
[01:23:53.335 --> 01:23:55.858]  It's called, like, I call it Nazi-slash-Soviet...
[01:23:57.001 --> 01:23:59.143]  Orwellville, or a bad dream.
[01:23:59.644 --> 01:24:06.550]  And now we have Alberto Gonzalez, the guy who says Bush is above the law in the hearings, wouldn't even go back on that.
[01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:07.731]  Can you comment on this, Greg?
[01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:10.334]  Well, you know, I mean, it is Orwellville.
[01:24:10.374 --> 01:24:17.761]  I mean, for those who... I used to write George Orwell's little column for the Observer, so... You know, I can tell you, it's quite Orwellville.
[01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:19.863]  I mean, basically you have guys who are supposedly...
[01:24:21.492 --> 01:24:22.572]  As you say, conservatives.
[01:24:22.632 --> 01:24:27.093]  That is, people who are here to preserve the traditional American liberties.
[01:24:27.373 --> 01:24:29.794]  And they're saying the president is above the law and he can torture you.
[01:24:30.034 --> 01:24:33.594]  And remember, they didn't say he can go out and torture just Iraqis.
[01:24:33.995 --> 01:24:36.255]  He can torture Texans if they get out of line.
[01:24:36.755 --> 01:24:44.737]  I mean, of course, you're doing a fairly good job through the more subtle means, like hanging out reporters who say the wrong thing.
[01:24:46.534 --> 01:24:50.635]  You know, it's basically saying that you lose your citizenship status.
[01:24:50.655 --> 01:24:54.596]  You can become, you know, if you disagree with the state, you can become an enemy combatant.
[01:24:55.837 --> 01:25:04.759]  This is the type of, I mean, it is unimaginable that they would have gotten away with this except for the September 11th attack.
[01:25:04.819 --> 01:25:08.020]  But no one is explaining how this has made us safer.
[01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:17.658]  No one has said that they've actually stopped some type of attack because they can, you know, they can torture some poor schmoes in Iraq.
[01:25:17.678 --> 01:25:23.200]  Remember, most of those prisoners in Iraq, for example, are basically, their neighbors turned them in because they didn't like them.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:27.141]  You know, someone is sleeping with some guy's wife, so it turns him to husband, so he's out of the way.
[01:25:27.281 --> 01:25:36.064]  Well, their own army report that came out last year said 75 to 90 percent of those taken to the 32 camps are families who didn't have their papers in order.
[01:25:36.384 --> 01:25:38.145]  Yeah, and what happens is, of course,
[01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:39.616]  I mean, are they terrorists?
[01:25:39.696 --> 01:25:40.537]  Well, let's put it this way.
[01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.099]  After they go through that, they will be.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:44.641]  I mean, this is the frightening thing.
[01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:48.445]  See, that's why they're not only dangerous, but they're incompetent.
[01:25:49.346 --> 01:25:50.708]  This is the other side of the coin.
[01:25:50.968 --> 01:25:52.269]  They're creating terrorists.
[01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:54.491]  That's what we have to worry about.
[01:25:54.511 --> 01:25:58.155]  Some guy, I mean, I read an interview with one of the prisoners who got out.
[01:25:58.195 --> 01:25:58.756]  He said, you know,
[01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:02.298]  You know, I praised, I was happy when the Americans came in.
[01:26:02.318 --> 01:26:06.139]  You know, then he's like grabbed and, you know, like, you know, brutalized, you know.
[01:26:06.159 --> 01:26:08.739]  And they said, well, how do you feel now about the insurgency?
[01:26:08.759 --> 01:26:10.340]  He says, how do you think I'd feel about it?
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:20.342]  Come on, you know, so what we do is, but of course that may be, as you say, Alex, you know, you have a dirtier mind than I do, I think, which is that simply saying that maybe they like it that way.
[01:26:20.822 --> 01:26:29.004]  I mean, what's the point of having a war president and having America locked down under anti-terrorism rules unless you create a whole generation of terrorists?
[01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:35.534]  Well, the reason I say that is, I'm sure you've heard of Rumsfeld's P2OG.
[01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:37.635]  No, go ahead, fill me in.
[01:26:38.116 --> 01:26:41.778]  Just type P2OG, and it came out about two years ago.
[01:26:43.038 --> 01:26:55.085]  A $6 billion a year Pentagon office to go out and enrage and widen the war and actually infuriate the Arabs to fight back so they can widen the war.
[01:26:55.305 --> 01:26:57.166]  I mean, they've even said that's why they're doing this.
[01:26:57.958 --> 01:27:02.221]  Right, well, yes, actually, you know, and look, you know, I have a nice picture.
[01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:07.665]  You go to my website, gregpalast.com, you'll see, you know, those nice pictures of Rumsfeld, the shaking hands with Saddam.
[01:27:07.965 --> 01:27:09.246]  Who created these monsters?
[01:27:09.586 --> 01:27:11.808]  So what we do is we create the Frankenstein.
[01:27:11.908 --> 01:27:15.771]  Well, now they're putting all the Ba'athists back in power, and that's making the Iraqis mad.
[01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:20.814]  I've got to tell you, I know, they've got, you know, like, exactly.
[01:27:21.155 --> 01:27:24.357]  The old Ba'ath leadership is now back in the saddle.
[01:27:24.995 --> 01:27:26.996]  Well, what do you think of this new puppet election?
[01:27:27.016 --> 01:27:37.019]  They're saying no one has even announced to run against the government candidates that were installed a year ago, and so the media is dealing with it by saying, well, we're going to have secret elections.
[01:27:37.279 --> 01:27:39.720]  On the day of the election, we'll announce the names.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:49.243]  Well, you know, I mean, one of the crazy things is that we are now doing something that was originally our nightmare.
[01:27:49.423 --> 01:27:52.004]  We backed the butcher of Baghdad.
[01:27:52.024 --> 01:27:54.305]  Remember, he was our butcher, Mr. Saddam.
[01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:57.420]  To fight the evil Ayatollah.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:04.344]  Now, unless we do something drastic, we are going to have Shiite clerical control of Iraq.
[01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:09.167]  So we'll have, in effect, Iran light.
[01:28:10.808 --> 01:28:14.330]  And this is supposed to make us safer.
[01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:15.510]  Do you feel safer, Alex?
[01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:17.912]  No, I don't, Greg.
[01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:19.273]  That's a good point.
[01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:23.315]  So we're going to end up radicalizing...
[01:28:24.582 --> 01:28:25.963]  But the globalists don't care, Greg.
[01:28:25.983 --> 01:28:27.204]  They're up in their ivory towers.
[01:28:27.784 --> 01:28:29.246]  Yeah, well, I think they like it.
[01:28:29.266 --> 01:28:31.307]  You can't have a war president without a war, Alex.
[01:28:31.387 --> 01:28:32.388]  I'm a war president.
[01:28:32.968 --> 01:28:33.909]  I'm a war president.
[01:28:33.969 --> 01:28:36.271]  I mean, how shameful is it to openly say that?
[01:28:36.531 --> 01:28:39.033]  We'll be back with more key issues and your calls.
[01:28:39.093 --> 01:28:41.334]  The Bush family, fortunes is what we're talking about.
[01:28:43.396 --> 01:28:44.317]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.797 --> 01:28:46.398]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.319 --> 01:28:50.001]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.872 --> 01:28:54.412]  We're good to go.
[01:28:54.432 --> 01:28:54.853]  We're good to go.
[01:29:13.821 --> 01:29:17.683]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[01:29:17.923 --> 01:29:22.345]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:29:22.546 --> 01:29:26.387]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[01:29:26.628 --> 01:29:32.811]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:29:33.011 --> 01:29:35.812]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[01:29:35.992 --> 01:29:39.334]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[01:29:39.414 --> 01:29:43.236]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[01:29:43.396 --> 01:29:44.619]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTHIS.
[01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:45.180]  That's 1-866-833-MANTHIS.
[01:29:53.095 --> 01:29:53.735]  We're good to go.
[01:30:14.045 --> 01:30:15.346]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:15.406 --> 01:30:21.290]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:26.594]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:26.694 --> 01:30:35.580]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:39.143]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.244 --> 01:30:43.465]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:49.528]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:30:49.588 --> 01:30:51.409]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:56.311]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[01:30:56.571 --> 01:31:00.873]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[01:31:01.114 --> 01:31:08.057]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:31:08.397 --> 01:31:09.137]  We're good to go.
[01:31:23.963 --> 01:31:31.105]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:37.888]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:31:38.088 --> 01:31:42.749]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[01:31:42.949 --> 01:31:45.490]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:50.292]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[01:31:57.913 --> 01:31:59.814]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:00.294 --> 01:32:03.134]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.935 --> 01:32:16.238]  All right, Mike and Lewis and Pat and Rich and callers in Oklahoma, you name it, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:16.278 --> 01:32:22.780]  Before we go back to Greg Pallast, the Genesis Network has begun carrying books and videos.
[01:32:23.499 --> 01:32:24.519]  I recommend that they do it.
[01:32:24.579 --> 01:32:28.281]  I don't make a red cent out of it, but I believe in what the network's doing.
[01:32:28.301 --> 01:32:32.562]  There are incredible costs with the satellites and the affiliate relations people.
[01:32:33.102 --> 01:32:35.923]  We're really trying to break out and get on more stations.
[01:32:36.023 --> 01:32:43.885]  That takes people to service those stations, to talk to those stations, to have the satellites we need to get on those stations.
[01:32:44.466 --> 01:32:52.448]  And so this is really a way to get powerful information and at the same time support a network that's telling the truth and getting the word out.
[01:32:53.954 --> 01:32:56.475]  And for $12.95, folks, you can't beat it.
[01:32:56.836 --> 01:32:58.056]  This is an excellent film.
[01:32:58.516 --> 01:33:03.059]  I went and saw it when it showed here in Austin a few months ago when Greg came to town.
[01:33:04.099 --> 01:33:05.600]  And I was considering carrying it.
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:06.541]  In fact, I was going to carry it.
[01:33:06.561 --> 01:33:07.101]  And I said, you know what?
[01:33:07.121 --> 01:33:11.623]  I'll just get the network to carry it so all the shows can promote it because it's so important.
[01:33:12.664 --> 01:33:17.086]  So I talked to Ted Anderson, and he decided to do that, the head of the network.
[01:33:17.526 --> 01:33:18.847]  Please give him a call.
[01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:20.508]  Order a couple copies.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.282]  At this price, you can afford to do it.
[01:33:23.682 --> 01:33:25.043]  One for yourself and one as a gift.
[01:33:25.404 --> 01:33:27.106]  Give it to one of your neocon buddies.
[01:33:27.967 --> 01:33:30.289]  And tell them to take a second look, to have an open mind.
[01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:39.499]  Because when you have dangerous criminals in government, I call them the Bush crime family, it's only going to get worse until we start standing up to it.
[01:33:41.201 --> 01:34:01.658]  So please give the network a call at 877-300-7645, 877-300-7645, or go to GCNlive.com forward slash shop GCN and his DVD and a bunch of other great books and materials that I recommend are up there on the site.
[01:34:01.718 --> 01:34:02.199]  So 877-300-7645.
[01:34:02.239 --> 01:34:09.225]  And then, of course, there's my videos that I carry, that I've made, and other films that I carry in books.
[01:34:09.961 --> 01:34:11.104]  I've made 11 films.
[01:34:11.144 --> 01:34:14.430]  My newest film is about two hours long.
[01:34:14.811 --> 01:34:18.578]  It's called American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:34:19.039 --> 01:34:21.444]  And I released it before the election.
[01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:23.011]  We're good to go.
[01:34:44.494 --> 01:34:50.661]  At the regular price, each additional is $5.95 while I'm still running this special because I want to get it out to people.
[01:34:51.162 --> 01:34:54.786]  Toll-free number to get my videos, my books, 1-888-253-3139.

[01:35:12.274 --> 01:35:15.496]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:15.556 --> 01:35:16.396]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv!
[01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:23.120]  We're good to go.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.340]  We're good to go.
[01:35:46.016 --> 01:35:55.623]  Journalist par excellence, you don't like to do that, but just talking to the man, Greg Palast, very intelligent, been out to dinner with you a couple times, visited with you in New York.
[01:35:56.024 --> 01:36:05.731]  You impress me with your scope and breadth of knowledge, which frankly a lot of people I talk to, most people I talk to in mainstream media, don't have if it's been bred out of them.
[01:36:06.832 --> 01:36:13.217]  Do you see Bush just getting away with more and more, getting wilder and wilder, more and more criminal, and...
[01:36:14.324 --> 01:36:24.967]  Frankly, going all the way to dictatorship, as I had the former head of the Navy, former JAG officer on a few weeks ago, who was opposing Gonzalez's nomination, he talked about open dictatorship if we don't stop this.
[01:36:25.047 --> 01:36:32.729]  I mean, what do you see happening in the next four years if we don't somehow expose this crime ring?
[01:36:33.489 --> 01:36:42.252]  Well, I think one of the things that's happening is the continuing, getting you to fall in love with your own imprisonment.
[01:36:43.079 --> 01:36:52.861]  The reason why Orwell talked about Big Brother is to make you fall in love with the police state, make you think they're actually protecting you.
[01:36:52.921 --> 01:36:57.282]  That's the dangerous thing where you begin to ask for them to take away your liberties.
[01:36:57.562 --> 01:37:02.343]  Big Brother is a guy who puts his arm around you and protects his little brother, you.
[01:37:02.383 --> 01:37:12.425]  For example, I talked about the company that helped fix the election in Florida in 2000, a company named Choice Point, who then ended up with the big contracts to keep
[01:37:13.204 --> 01:37:18.466]  Literally, 16 billion records on Americans and turn these over to the government.
[01:37:18.526 --> 01:37:26.070]  We used to have a constitution which said the government can't be snooping through your files unless there's probable cause you committed a crime.
[01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:30.051]  And now they're trying to convince you that you want this.
[01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:38.555]  They're getting mothers to submit DNA samples so that if your kid is ever kidnapped or crushed in a building, if they can find their little body or something.
[01:37:39.175 --> 01:37:41.296]  And so they're getting you to send them DNA samples
[01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:47.821]  Because, you know, if you're a good mom, you'll send in your sample of your kid's DNA, and who's going to get that stuff?
[01:37:48.521 --> 01:37:50.422]  I mean, so they want you.
[01:37:50.982 --> 01:37:56.364]  The most dangerous thing is not what they are doing to the law.
[01:37:56.524 --> 01:38:02.787]  The most dangerous thing is what they're doing to our minds, where they're getting the American public to actually say, yeah, this is my DNA.
[01:38:02.827 --> 01:38:03.867]  Please take away my liberties.
[01:38:04.467 --> 01:38:10.730]  And they give you this, they have you go through this baloney stuff of taking off your shoes when you go to the airport,
[01:38:11.089 --> 01:38:16.312]  You know, that there's a terrorist behind every lamppost and we can stop them if we take off our shoes.
[01:38:16.552 --> 01:38:17.973]  So it's a pretend safety.
[01:38:19.113 --> 01:38:21.634]  There are some bad people out there, but they're not going to go after them.
[01:38:21.654 --> 01:38:23.836]  We know who's funding the bad guys.
[01:38:24.036 --> 01:38:25.857]  The money's coming out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:38:26.177 --> 01:38:33.541]  But yet, George Bush, if you look at Bush family fortunes, you see the guy is going steady with Crown Prince Abdullah.
[01:38:34.301 --> 01:38:36.302]  And, you know, these are the guys who are dangerous.
[01:38:37.338 --> 01:38:45.688]  The guys who are dangerous are people like Musharraf of Pakistan, this dictator who now our president acts like they're blood brothers.
[01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.969]  They're bloody brothers.
[01:38:47.009 --> 01:38:56.875]  I mean, we're going to be, you know... Who has the nuclear weapons, and the con helped develop them, but Bush did W1999 that you broke to block stopping that.
[01:38:57.315 --> 01:38:57.976]  Well, exactly.
[01:38:58.016 --> 01:39:01.497]  I mean, we have the, you'll see in the film, the 199I document.
[01:39:01.517 --> 01:39:07.661]  In fact, the document itself is on the DVD where you can pull up these documents we show on BBC television.
[01:39:08.357 --> 01:39:08.797]  In the film.
[01:39:09.358 --> 01:39:14.060]  And, you know, it was spiking the investigation of the Bin Laden family in the USA.
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:16.761]  I mean, this is serious stuff.
[01:39:16.921 --> 01:39:22.364]  That's the great part about DVDs is that it's a film with a bibliography.
[01:39:22.764 --> 01:39:22.905]  Right.
[01:39:22.925 --> 01:39:27.127]  In other words, when I'm on camera, I flash a document.
[01:39:27.347 --> 01:39:32.429]  Look, we got something from inside FBI headquarters in Washington.
[01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:33.330]  And...
[01:39:34.586 --> 01:39:39.111]  Rather than just have me flash it by, you can go see the documents yourself, which is kind of cool.
[01:39:39.131 --> 01:39:47.839]  That's the cool thing about DVDs is you can see all these documents, including, by the way, the Bush draft dodging documents and other stuff we have in there.
[01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:53.364]  Now, the problem is, again, that
[01:39:54.329 --> 01:39:57.451]  They are, number one, they're getting us to love the police state.
[01:39:57.471 --> 01:40:06.356]  You know, what I used to call in Britain, I saw this process in Britain where people went along with the police state, and it's kissing the whip that beats you.
[01:40:07.316 --> 01:40:09.578]  Let me add something to that, and then we'll go straight to calls.
[01:40:09.658 --> 01:40:10.978]  It came out yesterday, MSNBC.
[01:40:13.041 --> 01:40:17.323]  And they're even calling it a name associated with Nicaragua and what happened there.
[01:40:17.743 --> 01:40:32.748]  And they're saying, they've hired, this came out a month ago, they've been hiring former torture masters and drug dealers from Latin America to send to Iraq as advisors to the Iraqi Defense Force, the Iraqi National Guard.
[01:40:33.069 --> 01:40:39.151]  And they said, we're going to have our special forces teams in snatching and grabbing and torture and assassination.
[01:40:39.791 --> 01:40:41.593]  I thought that's what terrorists do.
[01:40:42.373 --> 01:40:46.176]  But now they just come right out and say, oh, we've got to get tough.
[01:40:46.997 --> 01:40:52.682]  Rumsfeld's memo even said we're losing the war, so we've got to even have a stronger Iron Fist.
[01:40:53.562 --> 01:40:58.386]  You know, frankly, a lot of people go along with it if it really made us safer, but, you know, it doesn't.
[01:40:59.087 --> 01:41:02.850]  We are creating, it's like a terrorism factory that we're running.
[01:41:03.527 --> 01:41:06.029]  Abu Ghraib was a terrorism factory.
[01:41:06.089 --> 01:41:09.331]  These people, for the most part, were just jerks pulled off the street.
[01:41:09.892 --> 01:41:13.835]  And we turned them into people who, man, if you don't kill them, they're going to come out to kill us.
[01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:15.816]  That's really dangerous stuff.
[01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:20.359]  We are playing games with the Saudi Arabians who are still funding terrorists.
[01:41:20.379 --> 01:41:25.723]  The only time, you know, by the way, you know that organization that was named in the 199 document is called...
[01:41:27.046 --> 01:41:37.212]  WAME, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, which does some nice basketball stuff with Muslim kids, but it also happens to be a recruitment front for the Jihad.
[01:41:37.672 --> 01:41:41.154]  Now, they weren't acted on before September 11th.
[01:41:41.194 --> 01:41:43.076]  They weren't acted on after September 11th.
[01:41:43.096 --> 01:41:48.379]  You know when the FBI finally hit their headquarters and grabbed their documents and sealed them up?
[01:41:49.179 --> 01:41:50.360]  It was when they bombed...
[01:41:50.976 --> 01:41:54.059]  The oil compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:54.279 --> 01:42:00.045]  You attack the oil companies in Saudi Arabia, you're going to be shut down.
[01:42:00.425 --> 01:42:04.449]  You attack the World Trade Center, well, we'll get around to it.
[01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:07.932]  I mean, this is pretty creepy stuff.
[01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:10.711]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:42:10.771 --> 01:42:12.192]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls.
[01:42:12.412 --> 01:42:13.873]  I want to thank the callers for holding.
[01:42:13.893 --> 01:42:14.873]  These will be all over the map.
[01:42:15.694 --> 01:42:17.555]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:42:17.615 --> 01:42:18.035]  Go ahead.
[01:42:18.175 --> 01:42:19.076]  Hi, Alex.
[01:42:19.156 --> 01:42:21.777]  I want to thank your guest for all his hard work.
[01:42:21.837 --> 01:42:23.919]  And I want to ask him a question, Alex.
[01:42:23.959 --> 01:42:25.980]  You've talked about this several times on your show.
[01:42:27.177 --> 01:42:28.178]  Wide open borders.
[01:42:28.438 --> 01:42:30.239]  A buddy of mine called me up a few nights ago.
[01:42:30.259 --> 01:42:41.807]  I don't watch the 700 Club with Pat Robertson because he's just a total fool like everybody else is, but they did have a good show about these ranchers that border Mexico and Arizona.
[01:42:41.827 --> 01:42:49.272]  They just talk about how there's women getting raped in the towns, the local police aren't doing, you know, they're saying stuff, but the government's not doing anything about it.
[01:42:49.312 --> 01:42:50.173]  The borders are wide open.
[01:42:50.233 --> 01:42:56.597]  In Cochise County alone, over a million illegals go back and forth each year, and so how can they be telling citizens,
[01:42:57.157 --> 01:43:08.005]  We're going to set up TSA border checkpoints in the middle of the country, searching your cars and put transponders in your vehicles and face scan you, but the border's going to stay wide open.
[01:43:08.045 --> 01:43:08.565]  Wide open.
[01:43:08.625 --> 01:43:16.371]  And all it is is a primitive little barbed wire fence that this guy had that shows how it's been snipped and he's repaired it several times, and he said he's sick of it.
[01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:19.553]  And there's actually a newspaper, something tombstone down there,
[01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:21.955]  Chimstone Tumbleweed.
[01:43:22.015 --> 01:43:22.975]  Yeah, that's the one, Alex.
[01:43:23.035 --> 01:43:23.935]  Yeah, you know about that?
[01:43:23.955 --> 01:43:25.956]  Yeah, I've interviewed the owner of it, yeah.
[01:43:25.996 --> 01:43:31.457]  Yeah, so I just want to ask your guest what he feels, and what is the plan of the government, Alex?
[01:43:31.837 --> 01:43:32.457]  What is the plan?
[01:43:32.477 --> 01:43:34.678]  Do they want this to actually be Latin America?
[01:43:34.718 --> 01:43:37.139]  Because my children are in public schools, regrettably.
[01:43:37.179 --> 01:43:38.619]  I've been unemployed for six months.
[01:43:39.019 --> 01:43:42.420]  I had my kids in private school, and I had to take them out this year.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:43.920]  It's the first time they've been in public school.
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.101]  I have no choice financially.
[01:43:45.141 --> 01:43:45.861]  I can't afford it.
[01:43:46.571 --> 01:43:48.753]  And I'm just curious, what is their plan?
[01:43:48.773 --> 01:43:50.574]  Because I see stuff going on in the public schools.
[01:43:50.594 --> 01:43:51.635]  Okay, well, thanks for the call.
[01:43:51.655 --> 01:43:53.736]  Let me just comment on this and get Greg to comment on it.
[01:43:54.737 --> 01:43:54.937]  Look.
[01:43:55.569 --> 01:43:57.431]  There are six and a half billion people.
[01:43:57.471 --> 01:43:58.792]  They all want to come here.
[01:43:59.272 --> 01:44:01.454]  We cannot take unlimited individuals.
[01:44:01.494 --> 01:44:02.635]  It's part of globalism.
[01:44:02.935 --> 01:44:04.116]  Their own documents show it.
[01:44:04.156 --> 01:44:05.497]  Republicans and Democrats both want it.
[01:44:05.858 --> 01:44:07.579]  It drives the wages down to nothing.
[01:44:07.599 --> 01:44:11.042]  And then we'll have a giant poor mass that can't defend themselves.
[01:44:11.683 --> 01:44:13.264]  And this is the Pan-American Union.
[01:44:13.584 --> 01:44:16.907]  You think NAFTA and GATT were bad, the free trade area is going to be ten times worse.
[01:44:17.508 --> 01:44:17.808]  Greg?
[01:44:18.168 --> 01:44:19.029]  Yep, well, I mean...
[01:44:19.782 --> 01:44:26.168]  If you read my book, Best Democracy Money Can Buy, go to my website, gregpals.com.
[01:44:26.308 --> 01:44:29.811]  I've been writing about the free trade area of America.
[01:44:29.831 --> 01:44:31.112]  I mean, it's not free for us.
[01:44:31.192 --> 01:44:33.314]  It's going to be very costly for your average guy.
[01:44:33.754 --> 01:44:37.638]  Once again, they have a system of allowing workers...
[01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:44.838]  To come in through leaky borders, but who are too terrified to demand any rights, so that brings out everyone's wages.
[01:44:44.858 --> 01:44:47.380]  They like that, the kind of half-open-door policy.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:53.545]  They let you sneak in, and then everyone... Basically, it's a slave class.
[01:44:53.786 --> 01:44:56.108]  Yeah, so you basically have this control class.
[01:44:56.408 --> 01:45:03.975]  Remember, the problem of slavery and the problem of having workers on the lam is that it brings out everyone's wages.
[01:45:05.137 --> 01:45:06.158]  And that's the big problem.
[01:45:06.178 --> 01:45:10.260]  I mean, after NAFTA, you have to understand that wages on both sides of the border fell.
[01:45:10.581 --> 01:45:11.321]  Yeah, that's the point.
[01:45:11.361 --> 01:45:15.363]  This is more billionaires were created in Mexico, but the standard of living dropped.
[01:45:15.644 --> 01:45:16.284]  Same with ours.
[01:45:16.324 --> 01:45:17.845]  This is only good for the elite.
[01:45:18.225 --> 01:45:19.326]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, exactly.
[01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:21.187]  I mean, NAFTA definitely, you know, I mean...
[01:45:21.867 --> 01:45:36.458]  You know, this whole idea that a rising tide lifts all boats, that great conservative, or I shouldn't say conservative, it's really the elite line, when their yachts rise, all our boats too, but a lot of us don't have a boat.
[01:45:36.478 --> 01:45:38.459]  It's like a tsunami, we drown.
[01:45:38.839 --> 01:45:39.940]  I mean, this is the problem.
[01:45:41.361 --> 01:45:45.024]  And now, the gentleman was talking about, what do I do with my kids in school?
[01:45:45.954 --> 01:45:53.882]  The No Child Left Behind, as I say, No Child Behind Left program, read my article on that on my website, gregpalast.com.
[01:45:53.902 --> 01:46:02.249]  I mean, this is one of the biggest scams about because what they're doing is they're basically creating a new drone worker class.
[01:46:02.269 --> 01:46:03.751]  They're going to dumb down our kids.
[01:46:04.608 --> 01:46:07.869]  They're going to make them so all they can do is work at McDonald's.
[01:46:07.929 --> 01:46:14.130]  It actually lowers the standard, and then they go, oh, look, the test scores are up because you lowered the standard, and it brings federal control in.
[01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:19.551]  Using standards, you don't teach anyone by giving them a test.
[01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:33.353]  What you do is you are winnowing out people, putting a mark on them, and saying these are the people who will clean out the toilets at the Yale Club so that the Bush family... Remember that George Bush took a test to get into the Air Guard, and he got...
[01:46:34.179 --> 01:46:37.882]  In the 26th out of... Well, Dick Cheney flunked out of Yale twice.
[01:46:37.942 --> 01:46:39.543]  Let's take a call.
[01:46:39.743 --> 01:46:41.964]  Bush graduated bottom of his class, folks.
[01:46:42.905 --> 01:46:45.707]  And you know, this shouldn't matter, but it does.
[01:46:46.147 --> 01:46:48.289]  Having video of him and his wife eating their...
[01:46:49.423 --> 01:46:52.044]  They're mucus from their nose, eating their boogers.
[01:46:52.445 --> 01:46:53.525]  It does matter, folks.
[01:46:53.565 --> 01:46:54.686]  It shows the mindset.
[01:46:56.287 --> 01:46:57.607]  They don't care about it.
[01:46:57.627 --> 01:47:00.949]  Yeah, and they'll sit there on national TV and eat their boogers in front of you.
[01:47:01.009 --> 01:47:04.551]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry, Greg, I don't mean to... No, I know what you mean.
[01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:04.871]  It's like...
[01:47:05.191 --> 01:47:09.557]  Right, they're just saying, Bill Clinton says, because they can.
[01:47:09.997 --> 01:47:11.539]  Have you seen that video?
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.862]  No, I've missed that.
[01:47:14.202 --> 01:47:16.465]  I just knew while I was having lunch.
[01:47:17.166 --> 01:47:19.870]  It's at the Rangers game, and they're just both there.
[01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:21.391]  It doesn't matter.
[01:47:21.411 --> 01:47:21.672]  Right.
[01:47:22.212 --> 01:47:25.053]  I'm sure you've seen him flipping the camera off and yelling at his employees.
[01:47:25.533 --> 01:47:26.054]  Right.
[01:47:26.754 --> 01:47:30.535]  Well, you know, the problem is it's the arrogance of the power.
[01:47:30.576 --> 01:47:31.596]  No, that's why I brought that up.
[01:47:31.636 --> 01:47:44.101]  We've got all these substantive things, but yelling at his staff, flipping them off, him and his wife both sitting there, going to town, in the front row at the Rangers game, it shows a disconnect.
[01:47:45.586 --> 01:47:49.369]  I mean, I don't do that in the privacy of my own homes, you know, after age three.
[01:47:49.909 --> 01:47:51.770]  Or, you know, after age four, I quit doing that.
[01:47:52.311 --> 01:47:55.233]  But here are full-grown adults doing it on national TV.
[01:47:55.393 --> 01:47:57.214]  What does that say about their psychology, Greg?
[01:47:57.454 --> 01:47:58.795]  Well, it says that they don't care.
[01:47:59.275 --> 01:48:01.677]  They know they can get away with it.
[01:48:01.797 --> 01:48:02.858]  See, they don't care.
[01:48:02.878 --> 01:48:07.601]  You know, guys tortured in prisons, wars for oil.
[01:48:08.061 --> 01:48:10.483]  And all the time, it's mission accomplished.
[01:48:10.583 --> 01:48:14.866]  You know, in a way, people make fun of Bush talking about mission accomplished.
[01:48:15.225 --> 01:48:17.106]  But his mission is accomplished.
[01:48:17.387 --> 01:48:20.329]  He is doing exactly what he was there to do.
[01:48:21.269 --> 01:48:29.135]  To create a, you know, just like in 1984 in Orwell's book, it was always perpetual war against an unseen enemy.
[01:48:29.495 --> 01:48:35.139]  A war without, with no... Well, they said it was going to be a hundred year war, Greg.
[01:48:35.639 --> 01:48:36.860]  That was the whole point in 1984.
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:40.983]  It's the war against an unseen enemy that can never end.
[01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:45.161]  I mean, it's a terrific, and that, so mission accomplished.
[01:48:45.481 --> 01:48:46.942]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:48:46.982 --> 01:48:51.884]  I want to come back quickly, go to Lewis and Pat and Rick, and who's that caller from Oklahoma?
[01:48:52.905 --> 01:48:55.866]  Eric and others, and Greg Pallis is our guest.
[01:48:56.486 --> 01:48:57.107]  Listen to me.
[01:48:57.467 --> 01:49:01.189]  It's a powerful DVD, and the network has it.
[01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:03.010]  I'm proud that they're carrying this.
[01:49:03.190 --> 01:49:03.390]  It's 877-376-45.
[01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:04.531]  It is the Bush family fortunes, and...
[01:49:09.562 --> 01:49:11.003]  This is the documented stuff.
[01:49:11.143 --> 01:49:17.949]  From Bin Laden and the Bushes and the Saudis to the Enron scams to the draft dodging.
[01:49:18.009 --> 01:49:19.230]  It covers so much.
[01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:21.331]  It is very powerful.
[01:49:21.351 --> 01:49:34.862]  877-376-45 or gcnlive.com forward slash shopgcn or just go to gcnlive.com and the big banner says shopgcn and it's right there.
[01:49:34.882 --> 01:49:35.523]  But give them a call.
[01:49:35.543 --> 01:49:35.583]  877-376-45
[01:49:38.823 --> 01:49:39.504]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:39.524 --> 01:49:45.273]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and Infowars.net.
[01:49:45.514 --> 01:49:46.035]  Stay with us.
[01:49:46.055 --> 01:49:46.636]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.052 --> 01:49:54.554]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:57.838]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:57.978 --> 01:50:01.883]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:01.943 --> 01:50:06.148]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.508 --> 01:50:10.292]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.413 --> 01:50:12.235]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.795 --> 01:50:15.719]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:15.759 --> 01:50:20.464]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.644 --> 01:50:23.687]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:23.867 --> 01:50:26.731]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.211 --> 01:50:33.338]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.858 --> 01:50:35.679]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:56.313]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in U.S.
[01:50:56.373 --> 01:50:56.873]  are located?
[01:50:57.073 --> 01:51:00.455]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:51:00.676 --> 01:51:05.399]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:10.685]  Coming up next hour, I'm going to play that History Channel clip again about Benjamin Franklin and the Black Masses and the Hellfire Club.
[01:53:13.066 --> 01:53:15.107]  Ah yes, the old British agent Benjamin Franklin.
[01:53:15.147 --> 01:53:16.928]  That's coming up and I promise all your calls...
[01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:20.990]  Greg, we're about to go back to the calls, but you were saying something during the break.
[01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:22.951]  I said, hey Greg, are we going to have a dictatorship?
[01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:24.972]  And you gave me a pretty good answer, I think.
[01:53:25.992 --> 01:53:26.672]  Give us your take.
[01:53:27.473 --> 01:53:29.213]  Well, yeah, I mean, they don't have to.
[01:53:29.613 --> 01:53:36.536]  Because as long as they can keep the iron fist within the velvet glove, they're not going to take the glove off.
[01:53:36.576 --> 01:53:41.818]  As long as people are going along with this stuff and letting it inch along.
[01:53:42.478 --> 01:53:45.559]  So that, you know, by the time they've got all your DNA, all your records...
[01:53:46.676 --> 01:53:48.758]  They've taken away your civil liberties.
[01:53:49.859 --> 01:53:55.024]  They got you taken off your shoes and doing handstands at the airport on top of it.
[01:53:55.264 --> 01:54:03.813]  As it creeps along, and anyone who raises questions about their crony's contracts or anything else is in hot water, well,
[01:54:04.389 --> 01:54:12.236]  If you go along with that, they don't have to openly have a military seizure of the electoral apparatus.
[01:54:12.396 --> 01:54:15.439]  You called it a pseudo-dictatorship.
[01:54:15.659 --> 01:54:16.740]  Let's take a few calls here.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:18.862]  Lewis in Ohio, then Pat and others.
[01:54:18.882 --> 01:54:19.463]  Go ahead, Lewis.
[01:54:19.863 --> 01:54:24.648]  Hi, from Fleet, Ohio, Ground Zero, Big Brother, where they're putting cameras in every intersection.
[01:54:24.668 --> 01:54:24.748]  Yeah.
[01:54:26.363 --> 01:54:29.945]  Does that come from the local level, these cameras that are being installed?
[01:54:30.005 --> 01:54:35.908]  No, they're funded through the National Transportation Department and FEMA and other departments.
[01:54:36.008 --> 01:54:38.490]  You should know that I saw that in Britain.
[01:54:39.730 --> 01:54:41.211]  In Britain, they're very open about it.
[01:54:41.251 --> 01:54:47.795]  While they use it for things like traffic control and stuff like that, in Britain, MI5 and the government
[01:54:48.411 --> 01:54:51.174]  It makes no bones about the fact that this is a... I have the L.A.
[01:54:51.194 --> 01:54:54.116]  Times today saying all the cameras are going to be hooked into these A.I.
[01:54:54.156 --> 01:54:54.556]  systems.
[01:54:55.057 --> 01:55:09.008]  Yeah, I mean, you know, so it's, you know, so since we know how they're used in other nations already, where there is no, you know, in Britain there is no written Bill of Rights or Constitutional Rights.
[01:55:09.028 --> 01:55:11.170]  What is it, 4 million cameras in London alone?
[01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:15.694]  Yeah, so I mean, every move, I mean, basically if you pee, you're, you know, they watch it.
[01:55:16.775 --> 01:55:33.043]  My second question is, I just drove to Florida, and when I went through the Atlanta, Georgia area, Alex, I noticed these poles where there were two on each side, northbound and southbound I-75, every tenth of a mile, cameras going in both directions.
[01:55:33.083 --> 01:55:34.443]  Well, sir, you're not ground zero.
[01:55:34.523 --> 01:55:36.524]  In Austin, they're in all the neighborhoods.
[01:55:37.165 --> 01:55:37.425]  Wow.
[01:55:38.485 --> 01:55:39.746]  Do you sell bumper stickers?
[01:55:40.931 --> 01:55:41.732]  I give them away.
[01:55:41.752 --> 01:55:43.353]  If you pay for the shipping, you get ten of them.
[01:55:43.413 --> 01:55:47.795]  Well, on my way to Florida, my car had salt on it, and I have a white car.
[01:55:48.315 --> 01:55:54.579]  So I took with a pencil with an eraser, and I wrote, wake up at prisonplanet.com.
[01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:00.351]  And I gave the thumbs down to the Patriot Act.
[01:56:00.431 --> 01:56:02.053]  I just did try to do my part.
[01:56:02.393 --> 01:56:02.813]  Good job.
[01:56:02.833 --> 01:56:03.393]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:03.413 --> 01:56:03.694]  Thank you.
[01:56:03.714 --> 01:56:03.874]  Bye.
[01:56:04.134 --> 01:56:07.316]  Final call for our guests, and we'll come back and take your other calls in the next hour.
[01:56:08.597 --> 01:56:09.578]  Pat in Indiana.
[01:56:09.598 --> 01:56:10.158]  You're on the air.
[01:56:10.178 --> 01:56:10.538]  Go ahead.
[01:56:10.818 --> 01:56:11.339]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:11.659 --> 01:56:12.039]  Hello.
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:18.264]  I've been watching a book TV on C-SPAN, and there was a guy named Gary Wills.
[01:56:18.564 --> 01:56:22.006]  He's an author and historian, and he was telling about his book.
[01:56:22.767 --> 01:56:23.567]  A guy called in.
[01:56:23.627 --> 01:56:27.650]  He says, do you think the Illuminati has anything to do with the
[01:56:28.257 --> 01:56:28.737]  Who said this?
[01:56:28.757 --> 01:56:30.178]  You ought to get me a tape of that.
[01:56:30.218 --> 01:56:30.598]  I've got it.
[01:56:30.618 --> 01:56:32.159]  Oh, promise me you'll mail it to me.
[01:56:32.179 --> 01:56:32.439]  I will.
[01:56:58.422 --> 01:57:00.463]  And then Judge Andrew Apaliano.
[01:57:00.663 --> 01:57:02.884]  Tell you what, I'm going to hold you over to the next hour, okay?
[01:57:03.044 --> 01:57:03.464]  Okay.
[01:57:03.664 --> 01:57:04.044]  Thank you.
[01:57:04.524 --> 01:57:06.525]  Greg Palast at gregpalast.com.
[01:57:06.845 --> 01:57:08.565]  Folks can get the Bush Family Fortunes, $12.95, 877-300-7645.
[01:57:08.585 --> 01:57:09.346]  Final comments, sir.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:16.902]  Well, look, Alex, keep telling the truth on them.
[01:57:16.982 --> 01:57:25.888]  If it weren't for you, you are the crack in the electronic Berlin Wall, and I hope that your listeners understand and appreciate that.
[01:57:25.928 --> 01:57:27.929]  You're not going to get this information anywhere else.
[01:57:28.090 --> 01:57:28.730]  Believe me.
[01:57:30.051 --> 01:57:31.452]  Thanks for bringing me back home.
[01:57:31.732 --> 01:57:35.795]  Well, thank you, and actually, we can get it at gregpalus.com.
[01:57:35.855 --> 01:57:36.735]  Greg, good hearing from you.
[01:57:36.915 --> 01:57:37.396]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:37.496 --> 01:57:37.616]  Bye.
[01:57:37.636 --> 01:57:37.956]  Take care.
[01:57:38.176 --> 01:57:39.057]  Third hour, your call.
[01:57:39.077 --> 01:57:39.877]  Send it in straight ahead.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:43.700]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.365 --> 01:57:49.948]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.666 --> 01:57:51.726]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.447 --> 01:57:53.527]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.187 --> 01:57:55.047]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:56.688]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.348 --> 01:58:00.989]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.529 --> 01:58:05.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.691 --> 01:58:17.454]  Welcome back, my friends, to the third and final hour of this Tuesday, the 11th day of January 2005.
[01:58:17.594 --> 01:58:17.975]  Dishon?
[01:58:19.924 --> 01:58:21.144]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:22.165 --> 01:58:34.329]  I've got multiple articles from Florida, California, you name it, where they go, oh yeah, all the cameras are going to have these face scanning systems and license plate reading systems in them instantly if you have any warrants or if you're a criminal.
[01:58:35.690 --> 01:58:41.672]  Talk about big brother by this new Homeland Security Chief nominee, Mr. Chertoff.
[01:58:42.908 --> 01:58:44.249]  New torture developments.
[01:58:44.269 --> 01:58:47.832]  There's so much we're going to be covering in this third hour.
[01:58:47.872 --> 01:58:53.797]  Plus, I'm going to re-air that clip from the History Channel about Benjamin Franklin getting power from hell.
[01:58:54.657 --> 01:58:57.800]  Pretty scary stuff now being thrown in your face.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:58:58.901]  We were just talking to a lady.
[01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.890]  Yes, he did.
[01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:02.351]  He says, I don't believe they did.
[01:59:02.371 --> 01:59:04.913]  He says, I am a member of the secret Illuminati.
[01:59:04.953 --> 01:59:05.713]  Just like that.
[01:59:05.733 --> 01:59:06.954]  No, he was serious.
[01:59:28.644 --> 01:59:32.886]  And it kind of stunned the lady that was interviewing him on C-SPAN about his book.
[01:59:34.127 --> 01:59:42.050]  And we also have another video of Judge Andrew Apolitano.
[01:59:42.230 --> 01:59:42.610]  Yes.
[01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:48.493]  And he said that the documents that they just passed about the Patriot No.
[01:59:48.513 --> 01:59:49.473]  1 and No.
[01:59:49.493 --> 01:59:52.155]  2 was the worst in the history of America.
[01:59:52.175 --> 01:59:56.917]  And he says, don't believe it's the Authorization Act, it's the Patriot Act No. 2.
[01:59:58.038 --> 02:00:01.981]  And he said it was an abominable act that they passed here in America.
[02:00:02.562 --> 02:00:04.423]  And you have both those on VHS?
[02:00:04.623 --> 02:00:05.264]  Yes, we do.
[02:00:05.444 --> 02:00:10.368]  Will you please, please, double, sweetie pie, please, mail those to me and label them?
[02:00:10.688 --> 02:00:11.429]  Yes, I will.
[02:00:11.949 --> 02:00:14.571]  And what shall I put on there?
[02:00:14.631 --> 02:00:20.376]  Just tell us what it is, and then put a little note on there, and I'll send you one of my books or a video for free.
[02:00:20.736 --> 02:00:21.777]  Okay, I sure will.
[02:00:21.797 --> 02:00:25.180]  Because it won't be for free because you're paying to ship it to me, but just to say...
[02:00:26.535 --> 02:00:28.096]  You know, just say which free video you want.
[02:00:28.397 --> 02:00:30.518]  Okay, I sure will, and I thank you.
[02:00:30.818 --> 02:00:31.739]  Well, thanks a million.
[02:00:31.779 --> 02:00:32.680]  That's an interesting call.
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:37.903]  Yeah, so much of what the globalists are up to now is going public.
[02:00:37.943 --> 02:00:40.445]  They're flaunting so much of it in our face now.
[02:00:40.705 --> 02:00:43.928]  In fact, go ahead and play that Benjamin Franklin clip.
[02:00:46.570 --> 02:00:52.674]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[02:00:56.897 --> 02:01:11.329]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:16.174]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[02:01:17.134 --> 02:01:22.239]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[02:01:25.032 --> 02:01:25.492]  Why?
[02:01:25.573 --> 02:01:31.357]  The Hellfire Club, or you know it as the Illuminati, another one of the little chapters of this.
[02:01:32.458 --> 02:01:36.301]  Our other founding fathers, like John Quincy Adams, George Washington, spoke out against it.
[02:01:38.042 --> 02:01:43.667]  Many of them, well, not Adams, but George Washington was a Mason, but a lower level one.
[02:01:44.167 --> 02:01:47.990]  When he found out the upper levels had been taken over by these groups, he went public.
[02:01:48.431 --> 02:01:48.771]  So again...
[02:01:49.409 --> 02:01:51.270]  Most masons out there are not evil people.
[02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:55.312]  They just don't know what they're part of at a higher level, and that's why we're here warning them.
[02:01:57.213 --> 02:02:06.517]  And it's like this pleading guilty to murder, and the guy only gets five years probation in a ritual for blowing somebody's head off there in Long Island.
[02:02:07.318 --> 02:02:08.758]  I mean, this stuff is sinister.
[02:02:08.838 --> 02:02:09.999]  This stuff is serious.
[02:02:10.659 --> 02:02:14.561]  And that's what we cover in my film, Dark Secrets, inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:02:16.082 --> 02:02:16.682]  We're going to break.
[02:02:16.702 --> 02:02:18.583]  We'll come back and go straight to Rick.
[02:02:19.326 --> 02:02:22.328]  And Eric and Bill and others, toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:22.408 --> 02:02:30.615]  Once we get some more of your great calls out of the way, I'll dive back into all of this news and information.
[02:02:32.056 --> 02:02:37.960]  So please stay with us, and don't forget, we've revamped, redesigned InfoWars.net.
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:38.961]  It stands alone.
[02:02:40.066 --> 02:02:42.107]  And of course, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:44.888 --> 02:02:49.231]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.411 --> 02:02:53.853]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:53.973 --> 02:02:58.355]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.395 --> 02:02:59.756]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.538 --> 02:03:05.762]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:05.822 --> 02:03:12.750]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:14.893]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.233 --> 02:03:25.696]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:25.876 --> 02:03:31.277]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:44.461 --> 02:03:53.086]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:53.306 --> 02:04:04.572]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:04.792 --> 02:04:07.434]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:07.774 --> 02:04:14.238]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:14.398 --> 02:04:16.279]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:22.483]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:22.743 --> 02:04:28.407]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:32.671]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:05:29.472 --> 02:05:30.473]  We're here 24 hours a day.
[02:05:30.493 --> 02:05:30.533]  800-430-6748.
[02:05:30.553 --> 02:05:30.593]  800-430-6748.
[02:05:30.613 --> 02:05:34.214]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:34.234 --> 02:05:36.255]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.204 --> 02:06:06.691]  The New World Order aren't Germans, they're not Chinese, they're not Jews.
[02:06:07.692 --> 02:06:11.296]  They're Luciferian devil worshippers.
[02:06:11.936 --> 02:06:13.257]  They love death.
[02:06:13.478 --> 02:06:14.939]  They love to dominate.
[02:06:15.359 --> 02:06:18.462]  They love to abuse the weak and the innocent.
[02:06:19.063 --> 02:06:22.186]  Look at the fruits of what they do in the real world.
[02:06:25.367 --> 02:06:29.608]  And they've got the heads of almost every organization and group in the country.
[02:06:30.048 --> 02:06:32.228]  Almost all the Christian denominations.
[02:06:32.648 --> 02:06:34.229]  Many of the Jewish organizations.
[02:06:34.269 --> 02:06:35.609]  The Muslim organizations.
[02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:45.030]  They have infiltrated the highest ranks of almost every system, economic, spiritual, psychological in the world.
[02:06:46.491 --> 02:06:51.271]  And they are changing the world into their image, into their system.
[02:06:52.432 --> 02:06:54.012]  So I'm going to play this one more time.
[02:06:55.959 --> 02:06:57.221]  This is so important.
[02:06:57.241 --> 02:07:04.830]  This is the History Channel flaunting it in your face about Benjamin Franklin.
[02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:05.251]  Here it is.
[02:07:06.112 --> 02:07:12.219]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[02:07:16.218 --> 02:07:16.839]  So, in your face,
[02:07:46.678 --> 02:07:59.184]  Now, we've already known this for a long time, and back in the first hour, I read this Times of London, Sunday Times of London, Remains of Ten Bodies at Ben Franklin's Home.
[02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:02.205]  This is from February 11, 1998.
[02:08:07.047 --> 02:08:14.771]  Workmen have dug up the remains of ten bodies hidden beneath the former London home of Benjamin Franklin, the founding father of American independence.
[02:08:15.672 --> 02:08:20.573]  The remains are from when he lived in England in the 1870s, 1860s.
[02:08:20.693 --> 02:08:24.374]  He lived there, moved back to the U.S., went back again.
[02:08:24.394 --> 02:08:31.856]  And they dug up the bodies of six children and a bunch of other adults.
[02:08:32.556 --> 02:08:36.657]  Then subsequently they dug in deeper and found more bodies in later reports.
[02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:45.629]  And Paul Knappman, the Westminster coroner, said yesterday, I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime.
[02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:49.712]  There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.
[02:08:51.394 --> 02:08:53.015]  And that inquest never happened.
[02:08:54.856 --> 02:08:57.038]  Very, very serious.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:02.482]  But again, black masses, you know.
[02:09:03.607 --> 02:09:05.548]  Friendly neighborhoods type stuff.
[02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:10.051]  Perhaps, you know, we should clone Benjamin Franklin and run him for president.
[02:09:12.733 --> 02:09:14.895]  Maybe then the Christian Coalition would endorse him.
[02:09:15.575 --> 02:09:20.198]  Because George Bush is a member of Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and so is his daddy and his daddy.
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:23.200]  This is what they do.
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:24.041]  This is real.
[02:09:25.365 --> 02:09:26.645]  I'm sorry if it sounds crazy.
[02:09:26.705 --> 02:09:27.446]  It's in your face.
[02:09:27.746 --> 02:09:31.627]  The question I have for the listeners is, why now are they bringing it up?
[02:09:31.767 --> 02:09:34.248]  Why are they admitting it in so many venues?
[02:09:37.309 --> 02:09:40.430]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:09:43.171 --> 02:09:44.671]  I guess, who's up next here?
[02:09:46.332 --> 02:09:47.872]  Rick in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:09:47.932 --> 02:09:48.252]  Welcome.
[02:09:48.993 --> 02:09:52.354]  Well, you know, it's funny you mentioned Freemasons, Alex, because...
[02:09:53.376 --> 02:09:57.119]  Four years ago, back out west, I was raised as a Freemason.
[02:09:57.199 --> 02:09:59.521]  Well, I actually was initiated and went through everything.
[02:10:00.181 --> 02:10:00.942]  Become a Freemason.
[02:10:00.982 --> 02:10:03.844]  Now I haven't been active in the last almost two years or so.
[02:10:04.704 --> 02:10:11.049]  But a lot of the things that I had questions about, I would ask the Secretary of the Lodge or other things.
[02:10:11.129 --> 02:10:21.717]  And he admitted in some certain places of the world and even the United States, it just depends where you're at in the country of how far they go into it.
[02:10:22.793 --> 02:10:27.916]  You know, like showing favoritism in jobs and such and things like that.
[02:10:27.936 --> 02:10:38.583]  Now, where I was at the time, that particular lodge didn't favor being raised for promotions in jobs or things like this or getting off the hook legally in certain things.
[02:10:38.723 --> 02:10:39.583]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:10:39.623 --> 02:10:42.245]  Were you in the Masonic organization when you were a child?
[02:10:42.665 --> 02:10:42.925]  No.
[02:10:43.526 --> 02:10:48.368]  That's the order of demolay, I believe, when you're a teenager.
[02:10:48.408 --> 02:10:49.089]  It's the teenage...
[02:10:50.044 --> 02:10:52.726]  Yeah, and for the women, it's the Eastern Star.
[02:10:52.886 --> 02:10:53.426]  Right, right.
[02:10:55.207 --> 02:10:57.668]  So, I wasn't that active in it.
[02:10:57.728 --> 02:11:01.751]  I have family members in the Freemasons in the South.
[02:11:02.231 --> 02:11:04.852]  But like I said, I haven't been active in it in quite some time.
[02:11:04.912 --> 02:11:06.293]  I just don't have time for it.
[02:11:06.633 --> 02:11:10.696]  Well, I want to be clear here, because most people who are Masons never get even mid-level.
[02:11:11.656 --> 02:11:12.797]  What degree did you get up to?
[02:11:13.777 --> 02:11:15.798]  I only got raised to third degree.
[02:11:15.878 --> 02:11:18.460]  But there was also things you could go through...
[02:11:18.908 --> 02:11:22.990]  To get raised to your 32nd degree.
[02:11:23.911 --> 02:11:25.792]  And I asked him, well, what are stipulations?
[02:11:25.912 --> 02:11:27.333]  Could you get your 33 and a third?
[02:11:27.473 --> 02:11:33.676]  And they kind of laughed and said, well, you pretty much have to be really old and, you know, have to go through a lot.
[02:11:33.736 --> 02:11:36.818]  Now, he didn't expand on going through a lot to me.
[02:11:36.858 --> 02:11:46.083]  But there are certain, I guess, they hold these sometimes in Vegas or other places in the nation hold these
[02:11:46.875 --> 02:11:49.117]  Yeah, let me just stop you.
[02:11:49.157 --> 02:11:52.560]  The Masonic orders are run like an intelligence agency.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:55.863]  And so the people that are below the 32nd degree... We don't know much.
[02:11:55.903 --> 02:11:56.683]  ...are the equivalent of clerks.
[02:12:15.845 --> 02:12:20.147]  Who are filing letters to pay bills or something.
[02:12:20.627 --> 02:12:22.728]  I mean, it's just the outer porch masons.
[02:12:23.628 --> 02:12:27.890]  You don't know that there's more degrees until you become a 33rd degree mason.
[02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:30.071]  And there's a bunch of degrees above that, my friend.
[02:12:30.391 --> 02:12:31.191]  Right, exactly.
[02:12:31.271 --> 02:12:33.352]  And humans can only...
[02:12:34.289 --> 02:12:46.774]  Go up to about the 160th degree, and then there's principalities after those degrees, but then people like Alistair Crowley and the OTO and others, they claim that they want to even higher into all this.
[02:12:46.794 --> 02:12:49.255]  But let me just break it down for you.
[02:12:50.776 --> 02:12:56.478]  Again, I'm sure you know a lot about this stuff, but just for the listeners that just tuned in,
[02:12:57.358 --> 02:13:04.504]  The reason I explain this is so, somebody who is a Mason hears this and says, devil worshippers, you know, this Alex Jones is just full of it.
[02:13:05.204 --> 02:13:06.706]  They never told me any of this.
[02:13:06.786 --> 02:13:09.308]  Some infiltrate the Masonic Lodge.
[02:13:09.348 --> 02:13:10.048]  They admitted that.
[02:13:10.068 --> 02:13:12.751]  And they said, well, we can't stop everybody since we take everybody.
[02:13:13.691 --> 02:13:15.633]  Sir, you were being deceived is what I'm telling you.
[02:13:16.033 --> 02:13:16.774]  Exactly, I understand.
[02:13:16.794 --> 02:13:17.975]  This is what they tell you.
[02:13:19.356 --> 02:13:22.779]  I mean, did you get, I guess for the third degree, they didn't have you write essays, did they?
[02:13:23.199 --> 02:13:23.880]  No, no, they...
[02:13:25.509 --> 02:13:32.891]  I mean, they made suggestions to me of where to go, higher branch up, you know, the York or the Scottish Rite.
[02:13:33.031 --> 02:13:36.452]  Yeah, I mean, look, most Masonic lodges are just local good old boy clubs.
[02:13:36.532 --> 02:13:36.752]  Yeah.
[02:13:37.252 --> 02:13:39.092]  Okay, but let me just tell you something.
[02:13:39.493 --> 02:13:47.695]  You go to a high-level Masonic meeting, and again, that's the Skull and Bones, Spinoff Grips, Bohemian Grove, you know, clubs of these orders.
[02:13:47.795 --> 02:13:50.215]  It is out and out, Satan, we love you.
[02:13:50.715 --> 02:13:53.236]  I mean, it is just out and out devil worship.
[02:13:53.616 --> 02:14:13.021]  Oh, let me tell you, they, uh, I mean, and I'm not saying anything that can't be researched on the internet, I'm not giving away any secrets, but during the, uh, your first degree, they dim all the lights in the place and, uh, have, uh, well, I don't want to say a candle, sometimes they burn candles, just depending on what lodge you're in, and that's the only light in the whole place.
[02:14:13.901 --> 02:14:15.601]  Uh, and you're blindfolded.
[02:14:15.641 --> 02:14:19.822]  I mean, a good depiction of it is the movie From Hell with Johnny Depp about Jack the Ripper.
[02:14:20.282 --> 02:14:23.063]  Uh, that whole scene with the initiation of the Masons
[02:14:23.853 --> 02:14:25.974]  It's pretty right on, word for word, even.
[02:14:26.674 --> 02:14:27.194]  Yeah, I know.
[02:14:27.955 --> 02:14:28.675]  It's crazy.
[02:14:28.715 --> 02:14:34.457]  And just real fast, I was reading through the Constitution.
[02:14:34.477 --> 02:14:35.198]  I have a book on it.
[02:14:35.418 --> 02:14:50.344]  And it states in here that when a long train of abuse and intrepations revealed a settled design to subject them to absolute rule, it was not just the people's right, but also their duty to throw off such a government.
[02:14:50.444 --> 02:14:51.424]  So it is our government...
[02:14:51.923 --> 02:14:57.748]  Or is our right as a people to... Yeah, New Hampshire even has that in their Bill of Rights.
[02:14:57.848 --> 02:14:59.029]  It's the right to revolt.
[02:14:59.510 --> 02:15:00.891]  Or Clause 10 for them.
[02:15:01.311 --> 02:15:02.773]  No, the government is not our God.
[02:15:02.813 --> 02:15:03.593]  It's not our owner.
[02:15:03.633 --> 02:15:04.494]  It's not our master.
[02:15:04.734 --> 02:15:08.458]  And when it gets tyrannical, it's our God-given right to resist it.
[02:15:08.478 --> 02:15:09.078]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:09.098 --> 02:15:09.418]  Thank you.
[02:15:10.159 --> 02:15:10.359]  Yeah.
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:17.946]  I just, you know, people who come out and say all the Masons are devil worshippers, all the Masons are evil, all the Masons are drinking goblets of blood...
[02:15:18.999 --> 02:15:25.483]  That really backfires on folks because 90% of Masons don't even know about the higher levels.
[02:15:26.544 --> 02:15:34.389]  And so they just think they're in a good old boy club and think it has to do with Solomon and the temple and this hokey line they give them.
[02:15:35.150 --> 02:15:44.316]  But when you get into the higher levels, it is Lucifer, it is God, it is what they believe, and it is a push for world government to destroy the Christian church.
[02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:49.333]  And again, most Masons get mad at that because they just don't know.
[02:15:50.014 --> 02:15:50.954]  They're useful idiots.
[02:15:52.976 --> 02:16:02.362]  And when you finally know all the different Masonic signs, the lion's paw and the rest of the handshakes they do, then you see Bush Sr.
[02:16:02.402 --> 02:16:03.843]  and Gorbachev shaking hands.
[02:16:04.904 --> 02:16:13.430]  You see the head of the 700 Club at the front of Time Magazine doing the lion's paw sign.
[02:16:14.717 --> 02:16:17.018]  Doing these handshakes, just everywhere.
[02:16:17.339 --> 02:16:22.001]  They had a guy on C-SPAN attacking me about exposing Bohemian Grove for an hour.
[02:16:22.701 --> 02:16:23.382]  Brian Lamb.
[02:16:23.882 --> 02:16:29.925]  And the professor he had on there, who admittedly studies this, was flashing open hand signals.
[02:16:30.445 --> 02:16:36.549]  I mean, stuff that is very hard to even learn how to do with your fingers for an hour, just flashing them at the screen.
[02:16:37.829 --> 02:16:39.810]  I'm a member, I'm a member, I'm a member.
[02:16:41.291 --> 02:16:42.652]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:16:43.493 --> 02:16:45.994]  All right, we're going to break, and we're going to hurry through these calls a little bit faster.
[02:16:47.134 --> 02:16:57.017]  Eric and Bill and Maggie and others, and there is a ton of news coming up as well, but it's these secret societies, folks, and they're running things.
[02:16:58.058 --> 02:16:59.518]  And they don't care about freedom.
[02:17:00.258 --> 02:17:06.520]  But the low-level Masons will tell you, well, our order is all about the Bill of Rights and Constitution, why most of the Founding Fathers were Masons.
[02:17:06.981 --> 02:17:08.141]  Yeah, about half of them were.
[02:17:08.161 --> 02:17:11.322]  They were low-level Masons, and a lot of them later spoke out against it.
[02:17:12.535 --> 02:17:13.695]  Like George Washington.
[02:17:15.536 --> 02:17:19.357]  Because you get into higher levels, you find out that you've been manipulated.
[02:17:21.938 --> 02:17:24.038]  So, just be advised what you're part of.
[02:17:24.098 --> 02:17:29.160]  I mean, now they're flaunting it in your face, but one of the chief masons, Benjamin Franklin, was involved in.
[02:17:30.740 --> 02:17:32.540]  The Hellfire Club!
[02:17:33.341 --> 02:17:34.481]  Black masses!
[02:17:36.221 --> 02:17:41.263]  Getting his power from the host of hell!
[02:17:46.772 --> 02:17:48.854]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[02:17:49.574 --> 02:17:53.077]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:17:53.677 --> 02:17:57.200]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:00.482]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:18:00.922 --> 02:18:03.324]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:18:03.844 --> 02:18:05.245]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:18:05.966 --> 02:18:07.687]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[02:18:08.228 --> 02:18:09.188]  Check with your doctor.
[02:18:09.288 --> 02:18:14.152]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[02:18:14.648 --> 02:18:15.669]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066
[02:18:45.222 --> 02:18:46.703]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[02:18:46.983 --> 02:18:51.584]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:51.925 --> 02:18:54.245]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:18:54.466 --> 02:18:56.006]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:18:56.386 --> 02:19:01.488]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:19:01.788 --> 02:19:03.009]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[02:19:03.069 --> 02:19:05.770]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:19:40.146 --> 02:19:43.247]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:19:44.668 --> 02:19:45.429]  Terrorism.
[02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:46.329]  Terrorism.
[02:19:46.449 --> 02:19:47.270]  Chemical attacks.
[02:19:47.350 --> 02:19:48.030]  Dirty bombs.
[02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.530]  Fallout.
[02:19:48.610 --> 02:19:49.591]  Biological attack.
[02:19:49.791 --> 02:19:50.311]  Anthrax.
[02:19:50.391 --> 02:19:52.513]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:19:52.773 --> 02:19:54.354]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:19:54.614 --> 02:19:57.095]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:19:57.475 --> 02:20:12.044]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:12.084 --> 02:20:12.384]  government.
[02:20:12.564 --> 02:20:14.385]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:20:14.745 --> 02:20:20.670]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:25.314]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:20:25.554 --> 02:20:32.260]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:34.962]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:20:45.310 --> 02:20:52.615]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:20:52.975 --> 02:20:57.658]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:20:57.878 --> 02:21:01.761]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:21:01.981 --> 02:21:04.923]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[02:21:08.064 --> 02:21:20.907]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:21:21.227 --> 02:21:27.528]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[02:21:56.039 --> 02:21:58.460]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live here.
[02:22:00.502 --> 02:22:01.582]  Taking your phone calls.
[02:22:02.142 --> 02:22:04.024]  Eric in Oklahoma, thanks for holding.
[02:22:04.044 --> 02:22:04.544]  Go ahead.
[02:22:04.944 --> 02:22:05.825]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:07.205 --> 02:22:08.746]  Man, I'm so honored to talk to you.
[02:22:08.926 --> 02:22:12.488]  I wanted to talk to Greg, too, because he showed me how to ball with dignity.
[02:22:12.988 --> 02:22:16.630]  But anyway, you're talking about the...
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.683]  The Illuminati, all the secret societies.
[02:22:21.044 --> 02:22:22.746]  I think there is an endgame.
[02:22:22.966 --> 02:22:28.072]  And have you noticed how Christianity has become more reviled and attacked just lately after the election?
[02:22:28.172 --> 02:22:29.554]  And I know that is intentional.
[02:22:29.995 --> 02:22:31.757]  And it certainly seems to play into the
[02:22:32.794 --> 02:22:36.218]  Into the hands of the dialectic.
[02:22:36.638 --> 02:22:46.328]  And it becomes more reviled because the so-called Christian leaders are a bunch of warmongering Luciferians posing as Christians to give it a bad name.
[02:22:46.368 --> 02:22:51.554]  And then here's Bush's people banning crosses anywhere on the parade route.
[02:22:52.094 --> 02:22:58.659]  And you're just not allowed to have crosses, but then that makes the left happy, and then, oh, but you also can't have signs against Bush.
[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:01.541]  So see how they take everybody's rights.
[02:23:01.902 --> 02:23:02.342]  Surely.
[02:23:02.562 --> 02:23:08.407]  I mean, the right-wingers are happy to take the left's rights, and the left is happy to take the right's rights, and then we don't have any rights.
[02:23:08.847 --> 02:23:09.668]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:23:09.748 --> 02:23:12.390]  You know, Bush is very much the drooling puppet.
[02:23:12.570 --> 02:23:12.990]  I know that.
[02:23:13.210 --> 02:23:15.132]  But the people behind him are the most serious.
[02:23:15.712 --> 02:23:18.074]  They use, like, intentional incompetence.
[02:23:18.114 --> 02:23:19.155]  They use it like a science.
[02:23:19.475 --> 02:23:21.237]  Yeah, why did they use a drooling puppet?
[02:23:21.257 --> 02:23:21.437]  I don't...
[02:23:22.654 --> 02:23:23.194]  Excuse me?
[02:23:23.715 --> 02:23:25.476]  Why did they put a drooling puppet in?
[02:23:25.856 --> 02:23:27.738]  Oh, because, oh, very easy.
[02:23:28.098 --> 02:23:29.659]  People can identify with Bush.
[02:23:29.939 --> 02:23:32.901]  He makes gaffes, he's not very articulate, but he's affable.
[02:23:33.402 --> 02:23:40.827]  So, the average person, not very articulate, but affable, they see, they identify themselves, they put themselves to Bush.
[02:23:41.347 --> 02:23:45.050]  Why do you think they want Schwarzenegger so bad?
[02:23:45.709 --> 02:23:49.251]  You know, Schwarzenegger, he's their devil man.
[02:23:49.851 --> 02:23:51.772]  Schwarzenegger is very, very interesting.
[02:23:53.633 --> 02:23:55.034]  He is devilish.
[02:23:55.474 --> 02:23:57.915]  Oh, man, I'll tell you what.
[02:23:57.955 --> 02:23:59.756]  Well, he would be the ultimate puppet as well, too, right?
[02:24:00.657 --> 02:24:02.237]  They got a lot of dirt on him.
[02:24:02.257 --> 02:24:04.699]  They got a mausoleum of skeletons on that boy.
[02:24:04.779 --> 02:24:06.059]  Hey, man, I'll tell you what.
[02:24:06.119 --> 02:24:08.160]  Go back to Nietzsche, and you'll find your Superman.
[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:09.181]  You'll find your Schwarzenegger.
[02:24:09.221 --> 02:24:10.561]  He's Hitler incarnate.
[02:24:10.722 --> 02:24:12.843]  You'll find the Beastman, is what it's called.
[02:24:13.083 --> 02:24:13.443]  Exactly.
[02:24:14.366 --> 02:24:16.207]  Well, Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:17.247]  You are a hero.
[02:24:17.307 --> 02:24:18.388]  You inspire me all the time.
[02:24:18.488 --> 02:24:20.088]  I'm just privileged to talk to you today, man.
[02:24:20.268 --> 02:24:20.789]  Thank you very much.
[02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:22.249]  No, I was honored to talk to you.
[02:24:22.269 --> 02:24:22.809]  Are you kidding?
[02:24:22.829 --> 02:24:23.690]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:24.850]  I wouldn't have a show without you.
[02:24:25.531 --> 02:24:28.512]  Let's talk to, up next, Bill.
[02:24:28.632 --> 02:24:29.792]  Bill, where are you calling us from?
[02:24:29.812 --> 02:24:33.494]  Well, that must be a nice place.
[02:24:34.088 --> 02:24:46.193]  Yeah, the thing I want to talk to you about is last year I took a Homeland Security class for NBC's Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological, and the director of the class told us when the question rose up what would happen if the children were infected in the schools.
[02:24:46.233 --> 02:24:50.614]  She said a perimeter would be set up and the parents would be shot if they tried to enter the school.
[02:24:50.754 --> 02:24:52.915]  If the children died, then they would burn the bodies.
[02:24:54.055 --> 02:25:00.698]  Later on that year, we went to the practice session and about 25 guys showed up with assault rifles, body armor, and sniper weapons.
[02:25:01.374 --> 02:25:02.454]  At my place of employment.
[02:25:02.494 --> 02:25:10.237]  When I asked them why they had the body armor and assault rifles, they just kind of grinned and said, we may have to pass out medications at the end of a rifle.
[02:25:11.257 --> 02:25:18.019]  Yeah, well, I mean, this is all public, and it's been in the mainstream news, but back of the paper, as I say, the average person's in denial.
[02:25:18.919 --> 02:25:22.820]  Washington Post, Gannett News Service, it's in my film, Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:27.842]  If there's an attack in California, you can't have your children in New York.
[02:25:27.862 --> 02:25:29.362]  They're going to take them to a FEMA center.
[02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:34.332]  And then they're going to make you come turn your guns in to get your children back if you're lucky.
[02:25:34.692 --> 02:25:37.273]  So the whole country is going to be turned into Abu Ghraib.
[02:25:37.774 --> 02:25:40.835]  Well, that's exactly what happened on the movie from FX, Smallpox.
[02:25:40.855 --> 02:25:42.196]  I don't know if you had a chance to watch that.
[02:25:42.256 --> 02:25:43.956]  I didn't see it, but I got a lot of calls about it.
[02:25:44.136 --> 02:25:47.118]  Yeah, they arrested everybody and took them to a camp under the...
[02:25:47.765 --> 02:25:49.886]  Watchful eyes of a gunman from the military.
[02:25:50.327 --> 02:25:52.248]  Well, that's the good guys that do that.
[02:25:52.288 --> 02:25:54.870]  They take your families and break them up and put guns to your head.
[02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:57.071]  Look, just get ready to submit to it, sir.
[02:25:57.091 --> 02:26:01.674]  No, it's not the end game until it is the end game.
[02:26:02.254 --> 02:26:04.436]  And there is men waiting to fight.
[02:26:04.536 --> 02:26:07.458]  I know you don't like to hear that, but the bullets will start to fly.
[02:26:08.478 --> 02:26:10.900]  And I know that's not your opinion, that's my opinion.
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:13.261]  So, are you in law enforcement?
[02:26:13.982 --> 02:26:14.102]  No.
[02:26:15.672 --> 02:26:17.193]  So why were you in part of this training?
[02:26:17.573 --> 02:26:21.116]  I can't go into detail because I'll lose my job if I identify who I am.
[02:26:21.256 --> 02:26:21.796]  Military?
[02:26:21.857 --> 02:26:22.217]  Prison?
[02:26:22.897 --> 02:26:23.758]  I can't identify.
[02:26:23.818 --> 02:26:24.959]  If I do, I'll lose my job.
[02:26:24.999 --> 02:26:26.200]  I've got five kids.
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:27.421]  Let me say it this way.
[02:26:27.721 --> 02:26:31.523]  How many people in your area, I mean, how many people in your line of work agree with you?
[02:26:31.543 --> 02:26:33.245]  A whole bunch.
[02:26:33.345 --> 02:26:37.948]  But a lot of them are, like you said, they don't want to hear it because they're watching football games, basketball games.
[02:26:37.968 --> 02:26:39.069]  They like to play cards.
[02:26:39.729 --> 02:26:40.690]  They're not paying attention.
[02:26:41.351 --> 02:26:44.373]  But when you talk to them, they say, we won't go along with this.
[02:26:45.812 --> 02:26:47.253]  No, this is outside of work.
[02:26:47.973 --> 02:26:50.414]  The ex-militia that rose up in the 90s.
[02:26:51.694 --> 02:26:53.375]  The men that are still not in prison.
[02:26:53.415 --> 02:27:00.457]  Because once the militia rose up in the 90s, a lot of the people that were more vocal and... No, believe me, I know.
[02:27:00.497 --> 02:27:01.577]  Yeah, they went to prison.
[02:27:02.098 --> 02:27:04.738]  They were brought up on Trump charges and they went to jail.
[02:27:05.179 --> 02:27:06.259]  Believe me, I know.
[02:27:06.819 --> 02:27:09.060]  Listen, I'm not for defending ourselves, sir.
[02:27:10.072 --> 02:27:13.633]  I just know that the globalists want to have a physical confrontation.
[02:27:13.973 --> 02:27:16.734]  Well, you're not going to be able to ask these child molesters to stop.
[02:27:17.034 --> 02:27:18.294]  You're going to have to force them to stop.
[02:27:18.394 --> 02:27:19.395]  Now, that's my opinion.
[02:27:20.215 --> 02:27:22.836]  I know that's not yours, and you don't like to hear it, but that's my opinion.
[02:27:23.616 --> 02:27:24.236]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:27:24.276 --> 02:27:25.837]  Let's talk about it on the other side.
[02:27:25.877 --> 02:27:26.617]  Don't hang up, Bill.
[02:27:27.317 --> 02:27:28.137]  Or Eric, excuse me.
[02:27:29.958 --> 02:27:30.738]  Whoever I'm talking to.
[02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:36.351]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.852 --> 02:27:38.454]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.376 --> 02:27:42.059]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.047 --> 02:27:47.508]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:47.708 --> 02:27:55.053]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.373 --> 02:27:59.776]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.056 --> 02:28:09.882]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:10.642 --> 02:28:14.303]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:14.643 --> 02:28:17.124]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:17.444 --> 02:28:23.365]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:23.605 --> 02:28:25.225]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:25.425 --> 02:28:26.306]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:26.406 --> 02:28:29.386]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:28:29.566 --> 02:28:30.446]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:28:33.388 --> 02:28:36.070]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:28:36.170 --> 02:28:40.235]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:40.375 --> 02:28:41.276]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:45.472 --> 02:28:50.074]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:28:50.274 --> 02:28:54.736]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:28:54.916 --> 02:29:08.922]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:29:09.162 --> 02:29:28.349]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[02:29:28.569 --> 02:29:32.171]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[02:29:32.331 --> 02:29:35.032]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:29:37.853 --> 02:29:39.318]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:39.358 --> 02:29:40.621]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:47.279 --> 02:29:52.760]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:57.741]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.862 --> 02:30:04.683]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.063 --> 02:30:11.165]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.305 --> 02:30:12.525]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:12.585 --> 02:30:13.186]  We're good to go.
[02:30:29.645 --> 02:30:32.787]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:32.807 --> 02:30:32.907]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:32.927 --> 02:30:33.127]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.147 --> 02:30:34.028]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.048 --> 02:30:34.308]  Call today.
[02:30:57.102 --> 02:31:09.729]  All right, folks, I was talking to Bill during the break, and obviously that's not his name, but I was actually aware, even before he gave me the name, the name of this particular facility, but we're not going to get into that because I don't want to get him in trouble.
[02:31:12.831 --> 02:31:15.332]  Now, we've seen this all over the country, the preparations for this.
[02:31:15.412 --> 02:31:18.654]  It's in page 76 of the Homeland Security legislation.
[02:31:19.315 --> 02:31:25.238]  But tell folks in more detail what they told you they were going to do if there was some type of bio-release.
[02:31:26.087 --> 02:31:28.168]  Well, basically everybody would be under arrest.
[02:31:28.228 --> 02:31:30.549]  If it happened to the schools was my main question.
[02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:38.351]  And they said, if the children are infected, the school will be locked down, they will draw a line, and any parent that tries to cross that line will be killed.
[02:31:39.932 --> 02:31:42.653]  And I asked them, you're going to kidnap all of the children.
[02:31:43.813 --> 02:31:47.034]  And she told me, no, it's not kidnapping, it's for your own safety.
[02:31:48.775 --> 02:31:54.197]  Well, yeah, the Army said in Detroit Free Press three years ago, they said, we'll, quote, kill your grandmother.
[02:31:55.371 --> 02:31:56.152]  That was a quote.
[02:31:57.954 --> 02:32:00.096]  So what did they say they'd do with the bodies of the children?
[02:32:00.377 --> 02:32:06.463]  They said they would burn them if they had smallpox, because I'm at the age where I had the smallpox inoculation.
[02:32:06.483 --> 02:32:09.246]  I don't know if anybody born after 1970 I don't think had it.
[02:32:11.488 --> 02:32:22.236]  Also, I mean, top scientists have said that the new smallpox shot doesn't even protect you, and that if you have good sanitation, even with the weaponized smallpox, maybe 30% get it, 10% die.
[02:32:22.336 --> 02:32:27.180]  I mean, it's not that bad, but they love the fearmonger about it.
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:37.528]  Well, one of the guy directors said that he has gotten the shots three times, once when he was a child, twice in the military, and then he chuckled and said, I'm not going to get smallpox.
[02:32:37.808 --> 02:32:38.389]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:32:39.249 --> 02:32:42.271]  And then said, but everybody else that gets it, we're going to take care of you.
[02:32:42.531 --> 02:32:43.211]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:32:44.091 --> 02:32:45.712]  Yeah, it's all a big power trip.
[02:32:45.752 --> 02:32:50.294]  And the media has all these nightline made-for-TV shows and shows on FX.
[02:32:50.354 --> 02:32:50.835]  It's coming.
[02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:51.675]  It's going to happen.
[02:32:51.955 --> 02:32:52.976]  Give up all your rights.
[02:32:53.336 --> 02:33:00.760]  Well, when they did come in to set up the practice, it was about 25 guys with assault rifles and level 3 body armor.
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:05.442]  When I asked them, who do you think was going to be shooting at you, they just looked at me and smiled.
[02:33:06.889 --> 02:33:10.191]  And I guess that's how they're going to pass out medication to us is at the end of a rifle.
[02:33:10.491 --> 02:33:11.491]  Oh, well, that's been admitted.
[02:33:12.972 --> 02:33:14.093]  But, see, here's the problem.
[02:33:14.553 --> 02:33:16.054]  Was this about a year or two ago?
[02:33:16.634 --> 02:33:17.935]  It was last year in May of 03, 04.
[02:33:21.115 --> 02:33:30.257]  Yeah, because you know they tried to force firefighters and police and medical workers, nurses, doctors, EMS drivers, EMS EMTs.
[02:33:30.617 --> 02:33:31.998]  They tried to force them to take it.
[02:33:32.018 --> 02:33:32.898]  They said, oh, you have to.
[02:33:32.918 --> 02:33:34.198]  There's no law, but you have to.
[02:33:34.218 --> 02:33:39.779]  99 plus percent, according to the LA Times, said no.
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:43.860]  So they can't go ahead with the plan right now because their own people won't do it.
[02:33:46.061 --> 02:33:46.541]  Yeah, it was...
[02:33:48.092 --> 02:33:51.233]  I tried to tell my family members and they just thought, well, they're going to help us.
[02:33:52.713 --> 02:34:00.655]  And I thought, well, I've never been to a hospital and they had armed military troops, but I guess this is what they intend to do.
[02:34:02.756 --> 02:34:06.116]  If folks only knew what we know, what we talked about during the break.
[02:34:07.197 --> 02:34:11.338]  Well, there's a certain group of people in every area that are ready to respond.
[02:34:12.118 --> 02:34:16.939]  But if you jump the gun, they'll either imprison you or you will be killed.
[02:34:18.032 --> 02:34:19.952]  If you try to face them off right now.
[02:34:20.593 --> 02:34:21.773]  Well, we didn't talk about that.
[02:34:21.813 --> 02:34:23.493]  We talked about the particular facility.
[02:34:23.833 --> 02:34:32.195]  Yeah, I know that, but the thing, just like when 9-11 happened, everybody just went crazy in this area because there was a rumor of gas shortages.
[02:34:33.135 --> 02:34:40.097]  And I had a police scanner I was listening to, and the police were like, don't try to do anything unless there's some type of big-time violence.
[02:34:41.177 --> 02:34:45.318]  And people were in the middle of the road trying to direct traffic, causing traffic accidents.
[02:34:46.295 --> 02:34:47.676]  And, I mean, everybody was just going nuts.
[02:34:49.117 --> 02:34:49.437]  Oh, yeah.
[02:34:49.517 --> 02:34:53.359]  I mean, if a nuke or something goes off, it's going to be just total bedlam.
[02:34:53.659 --> 02:34:54.260]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.321]  I appreciate the call, Bill.
[02:34:58.322 --> 02:35:02.984]  But it's hard for the globalists to engage in this type of social engineering.
[02:35:03.705 --> 02:35:07.927]  And as Greg Palast said last hour, they've got to get us to kind of go along with it.
[02:35:07.947 --> 02:35:11.009]  And if we don't go along with it, their system will fail.
[02:35:12.031 --> 02:35:16.433]  But they want a big crisis to then bring us into martial law and then to never bring us out of it.
[02:35:18.073 --> 02:35:23.655]  Then the excuse will be, well, they nuked a city or they released smallpox, and now we've got to do this from now on.
[02:35:23.695 --> 02:35:26.276]  You've got to all be under police state control.
[02:35:27.696 --> 02:35:33.358]  And then don't ask why we'll have big NAFTA highways and wide open northern and southern borders while all this is happening.
[02:35:33.378 --> 02:35:35.159]  We'll just go, well, just don't worry about it.
[02:35:36.801 --> 02:35:38.242]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:41.564]  A final call, then I'm going to cover news for the last 20 minutes.
[02:35:41.984 --> 02:35:43.445]  Maggie in Texas, go ahead.
[02:35:43.465 --> 02:35:44.245]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:44.805 --> 02:35:51.989]  I want to bring up something I noticed in the papers a few months ago that seemed very mysterious to me and still does.
[02:35:52.730 --> 02:36:06.017]  About five months ago, maybe even longer, I saw in one of the Texas papers, and I can't remember which one, a photograph and maybe a little article with it that had the headline, Judge Roy...
[02:36:06.844 --> 02:36:09.586]  Or takes the Ten Commandments on tour.
[02:36:09.626 --> 02:36:10.988]  Do you remember anything like that?
[02:36:11.308 --> 02:36:11.688]  Yes.
[02:36:11.988 --> 02:36:12.369]  Okay.
[02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:16.032]  Well, now, in the picture that I saw, I meant to clip it, and I forgot.
[02:36:17.273 --> 02:36:22.537]  It showed a man, presumably the judge, although I don't know what he looks like, standing beside a tablet.
[02:36:22.797 --> 02:36:24.099]  I mean, beside a stone.
[02:36:24.419 --> 02:36:29.703]  And the stone he was standing by appeared to be granite, shiny granite.
[02:36:30.704 --> 02:36:32.826]  It was about four feet tall, like a large...
[02:36:33.311 --> 02:36:36.593]  Tombstone may be rectangular, perfectly rectangular.
[02:36:37.474 --> 02:36:50.104]  And the, you know, the likeness of the tablet, as they're shaped tablets, was carved into it, rather than the stone itself being that shape, and then that shape, and then of course the Ten Commandments.
[02:36:50.684 --> 02:36:57.269]  But above this tablet image, still on the same stone, was the pyramid with the eye.
[02:36:57.964 --> 02:37:03.350]  And above that was the inscription presented by the Ardor of the Eagle.
[02:37:04.832 --> 02:37:06.674]  And I didn't know what to make of that.
[02:37:06.894 --> 02:37:08.376]  I didn't talk about it to anyone.
[02:37:08.416 --> 02:37:13.302]  And then I didn't clip that picture and lost it.
[02:37:14.222 --> 02:37:32.100]  And then a little bit later, maybe a couple of months later, I started searching for it on the Internet, but all I could come up with in representations of the tablet that Judge Moore presumably has with him looked more like the real tablet, you know, marble and tablet-shaped.
[02:37:32.801 --> 02:37:35.944]  And I didn't see that, so I can't comment on it.
[02:37:36.044 --> 02:37:38.026]  I remember seeing the monument, and I didn't see that.
[02:37:38.974 --> 02:37:39.254]  Mm-hmm.
[02:37:39.434 --> 02:37:51.282]  Well, you know, what they're showing on the Internet, or most articles now are showing a tablet-taped representation in white and marble or limestone or something like that.
[02:37:51.342 --> 02:37:57.365]  But this had the pyramid with the eye and something that said, presented by the Ardor of the Eagles.
[02:37:57.506 --> 02:38:01.048]  And I thought maybe somebody else in your audience has seen that.
[02:38:03.447 --> 02:38:08.530]  Well, I wasn't going to take any more calls, but if somebody gets in and has specifics for us, we'll take their call.
[02:38:08.830 --> 02:38:10.151]  Thanks for the call, Maggie.
[02:38:10.871 --> 02:38:11.532]  That's interesting.
[02:38:11.572 --> 02:38:16.895]  I mean, all I know about that is that I saw it, and it was a big monument, a big block of stone.
[02:38:16.935 --> 02:38:17.936]  I didn't see that on it.
[02:38:18.976 --> 02:38:30.523]  And what you mentioned, and it just had the Ten Commandments on it, and Bush had the Attorney General of Alabama go after Moore and then gave that Attorney General a promotion to a federal judgeship with it.
[02:38:31.385 --> 02:38:33.106]  And that was hailed as very conservative.
[02:38:33.426 --> 02:38:33.806]  Okay.
[02:38:34.526 --> 02:38:36.727]  Inauguration controversy widens.
[02:38:36.807 --> 02:38:41.649]  Again, they're not going to allow crosses anywhere in the demonstrations or in the celebrations.
[02:38:42.869 --> 02:38:46.931]  And they're also banning a bunch of other forms of protest signs.
[02:38:49.252 --> 02:39:00.156]  So they'll always ban some form of free speech for the liberals and the conservatives and then each group supports the other group losing their speech and so we all lose our free speech.
[02:39:00.356 --> 02:39:00.636]  Very
[02:39:03.359 --> 02:39:04.160]  Very serious.
[02:39:06.482 --> 02:39:08.844]  Bible removed from Houston Monument.
[02:39:08.884 --> 02:39:16.672]  Another article there where they removed the display there, but every other religious symbol is A-OK.
[02:39:17.753 --> 02:39:20.596]  And then another one here, this out of the Associated Press.
[02:39:21.627 --> 02:39:33.754]  Police cite war protester for sign, a man protesting the war in Iraq, with a sign that blended President Bush's name with a profanity was ticketed for using obscene languages in public.
[02:39:34.094 --> 02:39:39.257]  But again, I have hundreds of articles where they arrest people for having a sign that says no blood for oil.
[02:39:40.598 --> 02:39:45.821]  The protester said Monday he would fight the citation, calling it a violation of his constitutional right to free speech.
[02:39:47.542 --> 02:39:49.943]  So all over the place this stuff is happening.
[02:39:52.576 --> 02:39:58.339]  Continuing with the news and information, Guantanamo Britons to be freed.
[02:39:59.099 --> 02:40:02.001]  BBC, four Britons held by the U.S.
[02:40:02.021 --> 02:40:03.862]  in Guantanamo Bay could be returned to the U.K.
[02:40:04.142 --> 02:40:05.082]  within days, U.S.
[02:40:05.102 --> 02:40:05.983]  defense sources say.
[02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:18.539]  Mozambique, from Birmingham, and Martin Mugabe, Richard Bellmer, and others from London have been held by the U.S.
[02:40:18.559 --> 02:40:19.560]  for more than two years.
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:21.340]  They were detained in Cuba.
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.641]  Camp, as part of the U.S.-led war on terror, the Foreign Office said it had been seeking to address U.S.
[02:40:26.661 --> 02:40:28.401]  security fears over the possible release.
[02:40:28.802 --> 02:40:30.702]  There has been no official announcement.
[02:40:33.308 --> 02:40:37.351]  Yeltsin killed man in drunken hit-and-run, biographer claims.
[02:40:38.432 --> 02:40:51.422]  I don't find that hard to believe about Boris Yeltsin, who for his last two years in office was pushed around in a wheelchair, so drunk he couldn't even stand up, probably drugged by his vice president, Vladimir Putin.
[02:40:51.783 --> 02:41:00.790]  Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first democratically elected leader, has been accused of killing a man in a drunken hit-and-run accident, went in power and ordered his aides to cover it up.
[02:41:01.934 --> 02:41:18.463]  The incident, which is alleged to have taken place in the early 90s, is detailed in an updated biography of Russia's first post-Soviet president, written by his former top aide and senior bodyguard, Alexander Korshakov.
[02:41:20.063 --> 02:41:28.648]  And his book, Boris Yeltsin, From Dawn to Dusk, was published in 87, but a new chapter containing the damning new allegations has been added recently.
[02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:45.601]  Now a deputy in the Russian Parliament, Mr. Korzakov, enjoyed unrivaled access to Yeltsin and his secrets during his rocky 9199 presidency, acting as his closest advisor for much of it.
[02:41:45.741 --> 02:41:47.282]  Now he's stabbing him in the back.
[02:41:48.023 --> 02:41:57.351]  The reason I covered this article is because this is what saying you're above the law creates.
[02:41:59.053 --> 02:42:02.494]  Bush and his top advisors have said he is above the law.
[02:42:03.154 --> 02:42:03.955]  He is the law.
[02:42:04.015 --> 02:42:05.275]  He can commit no crime.
[02:42:06.275 --> 02:42:09.877]  He has declared himself basically king or sovereign.
[02:42:10.697 --> 02:42:11.797]  The arbiter of all.
[02:42:14.158 --> 02:42:16.899]  And I just find it patently disgusting.
[02:42:17.479 --> 02:42:25.322]  Whether it's Bill Clinton or John Kerry or whoever is in government, none of them should be able to be above the law, much less say they're above the law.
[02:42:25.742 --> 02:42:28.503]  They've been operating as if they're above the law for a long, long time.
[02:42:31.078 --> 02:42:32.459]  But now they're saying it?
[02:42:33.439 --> 02:42:38.061]  That should worry everyone out there.
[02:42:40.021 --> 02:42:42.782]  It should concern all Americans.
[02:42:43.483 --> 02:42:50.845]  Because when you get a government that starts saying it can do whatever it wants to, that is absolute classic tyranny.
[02:42:51.986 --> 02:42:55.207]  Disabled peer condemns euthanasia bill.
[02:42:56.008 --> 02:43:09.941]  A bill which critics claim would legalize euthanasia through the back door was dealt a blow last night after a disabled peer warned its introduction could have led to her being denied life-saving treatment.
[02:43:10.382 --> 02:43:20.812]  Baroness Chapman, who suffers from brittle bone disease, said that the government proposal could become a license to kill and would not keep people safe, speaking for her first time
[02:43:21.999 --> 02:43:29.405]  In the Lords since being made appear last year, Lady Chapman said, By Lords, I feel I should declare an interest.
[02:43:29.805 --> 02:43:34.629]  If this bill has been passed 43 years ago, I would not be here.
[02:43:34.669 --> 02:43:42.794]  The state is going to kill you if you don't go along with what they want to do.
[02:43:43.315 --> 02:43:45.817]  Here's an article out of the Yuma Sun.
[02:43:47.418 --> 02:43:48.499]  Got your lunch ID?
[02:43:50.149 --> 02:43:57.095]  Y-U-H-S-D installs new meal payment system, and it shows the big scanner.
[02:43:57.115 --> 02:44:00.698]  The children have to scan their barcode to get their school lunch.
[02:44:01.898 --> 02:44:03.740]  Thousands of school districts have this.
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.201]  Hundreds have the thumb scanners.
[02:44:05.641 --> 02:44:13.408]  Students at Yuma Union High School District no longer need crumpled dollars and loose change covered with pocket lint to buy lunch.
[02:44:13.668 --> 02:44:13.708]  Oh!
[02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:20.052]  All they need is their student identification, which also marks down what they buy, what they eat.
[02:44:21.133 --> 02:44:22.193]  These kids love this.
[02:44:22.273 --> 02:44:23.894]  It's just right up their alley.
[02:44:23.934 --> 02:44:32.297]  They are taking to it beautifully, said Charlene Story, YUHSD Director of Food Services.
[02:44:32.377 --> 02:44:39.040]  As of today, all five of the district's high schools will be using new systems that allow students to buy cafeteria meals using their ID cards.
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:40.341]  According to Ms.
[02:44:40.381 --> 02:44:43.042]  Story, the system will expedite lunch lines,
[02:44:45.538 --> 02:44:59.125]  Now, this is happening everywhere.
[02:44:59.705 --> 02:45:03.027]  And again, you're not allowed to pay cash is the point.
[02:45:03.087 --> 02:45:03.728]  They get into that.
[02:45:04.268 --> 02:45:05.589]  No cash allowed.
[02:45:05.629 --> 02:45:07.230]  You've got to enroll with a card.
[02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:08.670]  Or with a thumbprint.
[02:45:08.971 --> 02:45:10.291]  Or with both in some cases.
[02:45:10.732 --> 02:45:13.053]  Most colleges have been doing this for the last five years.
[02:45:14.807 --> 02:45:17.088]  And this is openly part of a federal program.
[02:45:17.128 --> 02:45:21.769]  Then you look at Time Magazine for Kids, two different issues given to all the public schools for free.
[02:45:22.149 --> 02:45:26.030]  It's how great the microchip is and how the kids will all soon be getting it.
[02:45:26.050 --> 02:45:27.951]  I mean, they're really brainwashing them.
[02:45:29.071 --> 02:45:31.992]  This is out of the LA Times from the Big Brother file.
[02:45:32.232 --> 02:45:35.913]  Spotting car thieves in blink of a digital eye.
[02:45:36.773 --> 02:45:43.755]  The LAPD is testing a camera that can capture up to 2,000 images an hour to scan license plates.
[02:45:44.790 --> 02:45:46.612]  And compare them to a database.
[02:45:48.233 --> 02:45:52.116]  You know, funny, I've looked at the actual computer software company websites.
[02:45:52.216 --> 02:45:57.841]  It's thousands of license plates a second if they need to.
[02:45:57.861 --> 02:45:59.482]  So I don't know why it says that.
[02:45:59.943 --> 02:46:09.891]  The Los Angeles Police Department is testing a mobile computerized camera system that could markedly improve its chances of arresting car thieves at a time when auto theft accounts for nearly a quarter of property crimes.
[02:46:10.822 --> 02:46:23.213]  The new system uses tiny digital cameras, either handheld or mounted on the top of a police car to scan license plates to compare them to a state database of 1,123,000 stolen vehicles.
[02:46:24.094 --> 02:46:28.938]  The cameras can capture up to 2,000 images an hour on a freeway, in parking lots, or on the streets.
[02:46:28.958 --> 02:46:37.246]  So basically, it just drives you around and the cameras automatically pick up numbers and run them so your plates are all being run continually.
[02:46:38.331 --> 02:46:48.960]  And then now, police, if you don't pull somebody over who has a warrant because you're going to another call or you're busy or you're about to get off work and ask just some parking tickets or whatever, you're going to get in trouble, too.
[02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:52.883]  You drive down the street and it literally pulls up every... This is the article.
[02:46:53.483 --> 02:46:57.246]  You drive down the street and it literally pulls up every single car plate and tells you whether it's stolen.
[02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:59.648]  And see, that's for now, whether it's stolen.
[02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:00.249]  Uh-uh.
[02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:06.754]  The federal plan says it's to tax you, to track you, if you haven't paid your taxes, all of it.
[02:47:08.881 --> 02:47:15.945]  Said Captain Bob Graybill, head of the LAPD San Fernando Valley-based community effort, combat auto theft.
[02:47:16.205 --> 02:47:17.605]  This is going to change everything.
[02:47:18.386 --> 02:47:29.031]  Like price scanners and checkout lines at markets, the results are virtually instantaneous, meaning an officer is alerted the moment the scan focuses on the plate of a vehicle that has been reported stolen.
[02:47:29.311 --> 02:47:31.652]  With infrared capacity, the cameras can be used in the dark.
[02:47:31.672 --> 02:47:33.432]  All right, let me stop right there.
[02:47:33.873 --> 02:47:36.614]  They tried to pass a law on the last Texas legislature.
[02:47:38.402 --> 02:47:47.710]  Where if you, quote, had ever made mean statements or anti-police statements, not even a crime, you were to be in a database, and they were going to have these cameras scanning as well.
[02:47:48.151 --> 02:47:51.854]  And, of course, this software is already hooked into most of the cameras on the street corners.
[02:47:53.155 --> 02:48:04.445]  Graybill's squad is experimenting with two systems, a handheld British device that works like a radar gun and a vehicle-mounted unit, bubble units developed by Remington Industries.
[02:48:05.026 --> 02:48:09.910]  Law enforcement systems can scan traffic in both directions at freeway speeds.
[02:48:11.751 --> 02:48:13.832]  And it's about prevention as much as apprehension.
[02:48:13.872 --> 02:48:17.275]  It could prove a major deterrent to car thieves.
[02:48:17.435 --> 02:48:18.075]  Yeah, I bet.
[02:48:19.376 --> 02:48:20.057]  I bet it will.
[02:48:21.938 --> 02:48:24.780]  So, it's like the cameras at first were for traffic.
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:28.603]  Now they're for car thieves in the Florida town.
[02:48:28.663 --> 02:48:31.785]  Every car that drives through it has their records run.
[02:48:33.087 --> 02:48:35.670]  And well, if you haven't paid your tickets, we're going to arrest you.
[02:48:37.072 --> 02:48:41.116]  Everything you do, and again, it tracks your identity, where you go and what you do as well.
[02:48:41.857 --> 02:48:42.397]  We'll be back.
[02:48:42.417 --> 02:48:42.818]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:53.202]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:53.463 --> 02:48:58.204]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:58.424 --> 02:49:04.066]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.326 --> 02:49:05.046]  We're good to go.
[02:49:29.517 --> 02:49:29.717]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:44.617 --> 02:49:52.884]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.145 --> 02:49:57.508]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:57.789 --> 02:50:06.717]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:06.917 --> 02:50:10.540]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:10.820 --> 02:50:15.849]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:16.149 --> 02:50:22.901]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:50:23.381 --> 02:50:23.922]  What about you?

[02:51:45.805 --> 02:51:48.587]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:48.607 --> 02:51:52.410]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.433 --> 02:51:57.835]  There was a new article today about...
[02:51:58.547 --> 02:52:05.629]  In Boston, well, outside Boston, it's in the Boston Globe, up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:52:06.909 --> 02:52:14.110]  They just went out to whole neighborhoods and said, well, we've had a murder and we're looking for the person's DNA, so everyone has to show up and give your DNA.
[02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:17.811]  No warrants, no nothing, just we're wearing uniforms.
[02:52:18.571 --> 02:52:19.511]  Bow to us.
[02:52:20.392 --> 02:52:21.832]  This has happened in Louisiana.
[02:52:21.912 --> 02:52:23.512]  They're trying to make it the law everywhere.
[02:52:24.493 --> 02:52:26.413]  But in this case, it isn't even the law.
[02:52:27.489 --> 02:52:37.036]  I am completely interested in any of the methods the district attorney office is using in this case, but I'm not comfortable with this current method, said Truro resident Maria Fluke.
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.240]  We're good to go.
[02:53:02.643 --> 02:53:05.425]  See, they actually come to your house and say, please come wear this, please come give blood.
[02:53:05.826 --> 02:53:07.907]  And if you say no, they go, okay, you're being investigated.
[02:53:08.448 --> 02:53:10.569]  But in Louisiana, they actually forced you to come.
[02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:15.113]  This is a very personal decision, and it's one that's made public.
[02:53:15.153 --> 02:53:17.555]  I think it's splitting people up individually.
[02:53:17.595 --> 02:53:24.200]  I think people are confused about wanting to help, but not wanting to cross the line of their personal rights and personal boundaries.
[02:53:28.154 --> 02:53:28.815]  Just amazing.
[02:53:29.335 --> 02:53:39.244]  The main reason I'll never give, voluntarily, any of my fluids to the government is I don't know of a big crime lab, state or federal, that hasn't been caught framing people.
[02:53:40.385 --> 02:53:53.978]  I was at the gym a few weeks ago, or a week ago, and they had on the big TV, I just saw the closed caption, was it called Questionable Evidence, some special TV show, and it was all about crime labs framing people.
[02:53:55.916 --> 02:53:59.599]  So, uh, guards say Abu Ghraib abuses went beyond photos.
[02:54:00.079 --> 02:54:01.480]  This is out of the Sun National.
[02:54:01.921 --> 02:54:14.551]  Two Army Reserve troops at the center of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal faced off a military courtroom yesterday with one describing, from the witness stand, harsh treatment of his fellow soldiers that went beyond what the world saw in the photographs.
[02:54:16.392 --> 02:54:18.954]  Raping, killing, all of it.
[02:54:19.995 --> 02:54:21.776]  I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:21.796 --> 02:54:25.039]  There's a lot of news I wanted to get to, but we did cover... We did cover...
[02:54:26.371 --> 02:54:27.031]  Most of it.

[02:54:51.853 --> 02:55:03.782]  And some of the best tools we've got are my documentary films, and yes, I'm still offering the incredible specials of 50% off, 70% off some of my newest films and books and information.
[02:55:04.583 --> 02:55:09.207]  We're not just slashing prices on our older works, which are excellent as well, it's the new stuff.
[02:55:10.147 --> 02:55:13.610]  And the best films I've made that were doing this, where you buy one for $19.95, the next is $5.95.
[02:55:16.548 --> 02:55:18.249]  Of course, the old specials are there as well.
[02:55:19.229 --> 02:55:22.271]  Buy three tapes and you get $5.95 off each tape.
[02:55:22.571 --> 02:55:23.812]  Just a lot of new specials.
