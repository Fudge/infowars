[00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:06.201]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:07.921]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:09.742]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.202]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:12.883]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:17.224]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.766]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:35.397]  We're going to be live in the next three hours, and in the third hour, we're going to have Dean Haglund back on with us, this time in studio.
[00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:52.268]  Dean Hagelin, nine seasons with the X-Files and a season, of course, with Alone Gunman.
[00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:57.449]  And, of course, he's been in many, many other major motion pictures and TV shows.
[00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:01.070]  And he knows about the New World Order and is concerned about it.
[00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.792]  And he told us last time how the CIA, Chris Carter and others told him, would plant a lot of the plots on them.
[00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:09.092]  And NASA would as well.
[00:01:09.112 --> 00:01:11.053]  They tell him this is a good idea for him to do a piece on.
[00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:13.494]  And, of course, Alone Gunman, just months before 9-11,
[00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.066]  It's a pilot episode, to be precise.
[00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:17.966]  They didn't have a season.
[00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:26.412]  Had a plot where the government, a criminal element in the government, has drills to confuse the population
[00:01:27.342 --> 00:01:45.775]  To confuse the military and NORAD to think that it's just a drill, and they use that and remote control the plane into a building, or attempt to, a passenger jet, into the World Trade Center, to then blame it on imaginary hijackers, to claim that Afghanis attacked us.
[00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.298]  And then of course, exactly that happens.
[00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:55.903]  So, Dee's supposed to show up around the middle of the show today, but to be in here with us in the third hour.
[00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:05.422]  And we're scheduled to videotape it as well and put it on the website at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:07.607]  So that's coming up today!
[00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:11.107]  The Pentagon doesn't deny domestic surveillance.
[00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:18.233]  The Associated Press reports that it's for all of our safety, that the military's new job will be watching us and controlling our daily lives, basically.
[00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:20.815]  The House has voted to revise.
[00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:24.559]  By the way, you can change that to expand.
[00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.600]  You're hearing it's a reform, i.e.
[00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:29.563]  making it better, more freedom.
[00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:33.847]  And no, the revision that I've looked at actually makes it worse.
[00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:42.954]  And extend the Patriot Act, making large portions of it permanent, and some of the other provisions extended for another four plus years, four and a half years roughly.
[00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:54.678]  Also, I want to get into the consumer price plunge and production jumps as fuel prices go down quite a bit.
[00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:56.442]  But see how they train us?
[00:02:56.462 --> 00:02:57.883]  It goes up to $3.50 a gallon.
[00:02:57.903 --> 00:03:03.987]  Then when it gets down to $2 a gallon, we're very thankful when it was $1.50 just three years ago.
[00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:07.790]  And they're talking about it jacking back up to $3 this summer.
[00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.691]  It's just a total scam.
[00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:13.554]  They say there's heavy voter turnout in Iraq.
[00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:16.536]  Just total propaganda.
[00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:18.910]  These elections are staged.
[00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.573]  Every time our government gets caught staging them, they claim Iran is shipping the fake ballots about.
[00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.033]  Just totally ridiculous.
[00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:29.156]  Also, our own government tried to buy silence from a German kidnap victim.
[00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:30.577]  Kidnapped and tortured.
[00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.398]  That's out of Reuters.
[00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:37.661]  Pentagon surveillance of anti-war groups extends to Madison, there in Wisconsin.
[00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:39.922]  Got a big article out by Steve Watson.
[00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.115]  Martial law no longer on the horizon.
[00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.877]  It's already here, part one.
[00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:49.701]  Militarized federal police all over the streets with the precedent to kill.
[00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:54.806]  And a few weeks ago we had the mother on and her son on.
[00:03:55.866 --> 00:04:04.174]  He'd been expelled from school or suspended for a week for finding a video camera in the bathroom and taking it down and showing it to his mother.
[00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:07.157]  Well, now I've got one.
[00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:12.600]  From another part of the United States, hidden camera in Boy's bathroom.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.182]  KWCH 12 Eyewitness News.
[00:04:17.383 --> 00:04:23.428]  And we'll cover that when we get back, and I believe there's also a video clip with this, so we'll try to play that for you.
[00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:28.211]  Also, statistics suggest race not a factor in Katrina deaths.
[00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:32.535]  It's now showing that it was equally balanced out across the different
[00:04:33.504 --> 00:04:34.384]  Different races.
[00:04:35.084 --> 00:04:35.685]  I love the media.
[00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:38.045]  They say this thing is race, but then everything is race.
[00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:48.107]  Oh, and Don King, the convicted murderer and racketeer, just loves George W. Bush.
[00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.688]  Well, what racketeer doesn't?
[00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:52.188]  So we'll get into that.
[00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.749]  More on the no-fly list being expanded.
[00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:56.149]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:58.590]  It's all on InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.800]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.101]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:10.122]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:14.403]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:18.524]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:20.525]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.665 --> 00:05:23.986]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:25.106]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:28.747]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:31.928]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:35.009]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.572]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:45.897]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:02.276]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:08.379]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.762]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:23.387]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:28.693]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:33.018]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.238 --> 00:06:37.984]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:44.251]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:50.821]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:08.000]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:21.068]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:23.030]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.672]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:30.735]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:35.958]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:07:36.238 --> 00:07:37.919]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.182]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotion.
[00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:44.243]  Zango is what you are looking for.
[00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:47.025]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarkets.com.
[00:07:50.847 --> 00:08:07.494]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:15.458]  I remember four or five years ago, as the reports started coming in,
[00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:22.782]  Of cameras in school bathrooms, school showers, and people were just blown away.
[00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:26.965]  They were so shocked by it that even listeners didn't want to believe it.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:36.423]  Despite the fact that it was in mainstream newspapers and on mainstream TV news websites and they were always spinning it like, oh, it's a good thing, it's wonderful.
[00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:55.889]  Now it's becoming a weekly occurrence where not just that we see reports of cameras in the bathrooms, in the showers, sometimes not in the stalls, sometimes in the stalls, sometimes not directly on the children when they're showering, many times when they are, and they just try to say, hey, they're in our custody when they are and we can do what we want.
[00:08:57.719 --> 00:08:59.781]  Talk about Big Brother here in America.
[00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:01.162]  Well, here it is.
[00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:03.484]  This is from News 12 out of Wichita, Kansas.
[00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:05.806]  A little military industrial complex town.
[00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:08.869]  Hidden camera in Boy's bathroom.
[00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:11.251]  This is from KWCH-TV.
[00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:12.732]  You can go to infowarriors.com.
[00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:18.243]  Watch this, and that is a link through to the story, and watch the little clip.
[00:09:18.743 --> 00:09:23.909]  An East High freshman faces expulsion for something the district says never should have happened.
[00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:25.731]  Oh, they're backing off there.
[00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:30.696]  Monday, Charles Rogers discovered a camera in the foyer of the boys' bathroom.
[00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:34.430]  The camera there, period, surprises me.
[00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:37.132]  It was a little spy camera.
[00:09:37.573 --> 00:09:39.855]  I didn't think anything like that was in the bathroom.
[00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:41.496]  I didn't think it was in the schools.
[00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:45.779]  I thought it was a perverted janitor, Charles said.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:53.465]  Because, yes, if you Google search it, just a year ago or so, a janitor got a couple years in prison, and he should have.
[00:09:53.966 --> 00:10:00.591]  The perv had a camera in the girl's bathroom, and it was going back to his janitor's closet or room.
[00:10:02.472 --> 00:10:05.614]  But when the principals do it, it's good.
[00:10:06.154 --> 00:10:07.855]  He took the camera, he says.
[00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.257]  It was in a little hole in the ceiling tile.
[00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:13.339]  He also took the receiver, which was in the school's auditorium.
[00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.800]  It looked like an irregular setup.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.623]  It wasn't in a security room, his mom, Melinda Rogers, said.
[00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:21.363]  Ms.
[00:10:21.403 --> 00:10:24.946]  Rogers says what her son did was wrong.
[00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:25.786]  Ms.
[00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:27.287]  Rogers says what her son did was wrong.
[00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:28.848]  Why don't you back your son up?
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.382]  I need to get her on and set her straight.
[00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:35.086]  But she wants to know why there was a hidden camera to begin with.
[00:10:35.106 --> 00:10:38.230]  Eyewitness News asked the district that question.
[00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.311]  What's wrong?
[00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:42.575]  I mean, especially if you think it's a pervs camera.
[00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:43.816]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:10:43.856 --> 00:10:45.058]  I found a camera in a bathroom.
[00:10:45.298 --> 00:10:45.979]  It's coming down.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.661]  It's coming down.
[00:10:50.536 --> 00:10:56.038]  It says, cameras were installed in two boys bathrooms at East High to see who was drawing graffiti.
[00:10:56.058 --> 00:10:57.398]  You see, it's always the same thing.
[00:10:57.678 --> 00:11:03.000]  But they go on to say, it was a mistake and we admit this was a mistake and it won't happen again.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.841]  And that's what the superintendent has to say.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.904]  Arnsman says the school put up the camera sometime this year without telling the district.
[00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:15.027]  Oh, she says the other camera has now been removed as well.
[00:11:15.087 --> 00:11:17.930]  Rogers has also been removed from East High.
[00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.093]  Next week he has an expulsion hearing for stealing the camera.
[00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:27.178]  I think he should be punished, but to be expelled for the rest of the year is kind of tough.
[00:11:27.698 --> 00:11:32.442]  As misguided as it was, he thought he was doing good and taking down the hidden cameras.
[00:11:32.502 --> 00:11:34.603]  Mom said the hearing is next Thursday.
[00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:37.325]  We'll keep you posted on what happens.
[00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:46.452]  And it doesn't say here if he brought it to the principal or if he brought it to his mother like the young man in Jasper County, Georgia did.
[00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:49.414]  They just suspended him for the week.
[00:11:50.123 --> 00:12:02.290]  And then the principal said, by the way, who hadn't told the district, it was the principal from across the street at the high school had come over there at the middle school and put this camera in the bathroom.
[00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.451]  And that one was into the stalls.
[00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:07.633]  It just supposedly didn't cover the entire toilet.
[00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:11.975]  And then we have to have arguments about this now with people.
[00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:13.456]  Oh, this is Big Brother.
[00:12:13.636 --> 00:12:14.536]  Oh, no, it's not.
[00:12:14.557 --> 00:12:17.058]  But I just want to advise you.
[00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:26.547]  I will not use federal or state rest areas.
[00:12:27.387 --> 00:12:36.149]  Now, I was driving out to New Mexico last Christmas for a family vacation, took off a week, and we stopped at a rest area.
[00:12:37.209 --> 00:12:43.311]  We had an RV, we didn't even need to, but we stopped at the rest area because you could see those giant farms of the huge
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.563]  Windmills that generate power for some of the cities out there.
[00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.504]  Very science fiction looking.
[00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:57.972]  So, you know, we stopped there to admire the mountains and things, but I would not let my wife take my children into those things, because a lot of times they've got cameras on them.
[00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:09.802]  In fact, I saw a report, what was it, five years ago, that every rest area in Michigan, the state, every state rest area was getting a camera in the bathroom, over the stalls.
[00:13:11.183 --> 00:13:12.124]  That was an AP article.
[00:13:13.216 --> 00:13:16.019]  So see, I'm a weirdo because I won't go into a rest area.
[00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:17.601]  Well, I don't want to be videotaped.
[00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:19.322]  I don't want my family videotaped.
[00:13:19.342 --> 00:13:22.005]  I don't want my children videotaped by the government.
[00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.608]  But let's stop right there.
[00:13:24.768 --> 00:13:25.869]  Let's just stop right there.
[00:13:27.569 --> 00:13:29.890]  Right after 9-11, they put them in four airports.
[00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:44.277]  Last time I saw an article about it a few months ago, they were saying that 20 of our biggest international airports, that's basically every one of them, here in the United States are going to have the special x-ray machines put in it.
[00:13:44.337 --> 00:13:48.219]  And we've all seen the images of these on TV and the web, at least most of us have.
[00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:51.120]  We've posted them on the websites, where you're totally naked.
[00:13:51.943 --> 00:13:54.824]  In fact, these have vision even greater than the human eye.
[00:13:54.844 --> 00:13:55.665]  And you go, what does that mean?
[00:13:55.725 --> 00:13:57.005]  You're using your human eye to look at the image.
[00:13:57.526 --> 00:14:03.208]  Well, if I look at somebody who's standing there naked ten feet from me, I'm not going to see all their pores.
[00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:06.250]  I'm not going to see the slightest details.
[00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.252]  It is a higher quality vision than even your eyes can behold.
[00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:15.234]  You know, your wife or husband naked.
[00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:17.755]  I mean, it's so intimate.
[00:14:18.906 --> 00:14:21.068]  And it just shows everything.
[00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:29.355]  In fact, a lot of these images that were on ABC News and stuff, we wouldn't, on their websites, we wouldn't even post because they're pornographic, and we don't want to get listed as a pornographic website.
[00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:30.496]  But you've seen them.
[00:14:31.397 --> 00:14:37.622]  You know, the man sitting there, and it's online, the frontal views, every detail, everything on it.
[00:14:38.984 --> 00:14:39.344]  Women.
[00:14:40.385 --> 00:14:44.168]  And when you walk through these, hard drives are recording it.
[00:14:44.188 --> 00:14:44.789]  That's admitted.
[00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:46.010]  Hard drives.
[00:14:47.271 --> 00:14:57.897]  There you are with your wife and your three children, your two children, whatever, your wife by herself, whatever, and you're walking through these, and at the airports that do it, they don't even tell you you're going through them.
[00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:00.318]  They just have you walk through them.
[00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.899]  They tell you to stand there for a second.
[00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:03.079]  They don't even question.
[00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:06.001]  And there are those people in that little glass room off to the side.
[00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:10.123]  There they are videotaping your naked body.
[00:15:10.163 --> 00:15:14.405]  You are now, you are now basically ready for your spread and playboy.
[00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:19.948]  Now, see, this is how far it's gone.
[00:15:21.308 --> 00:15:25.972]  And by the way, the TSA in New York and Boston and Chicago and L.A.
[00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:30.095]  have ordered for bus terminals and train stations, guess what they've ordered?
[00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:36.159]  They've ordered those little babies, those x-ray machines, and they're going in all over the place.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:44.245]  And I call them x-rays, they're actually, really you should call them a sonar system, they actually don't use x-rays.
[00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:47.449]  But every time the news covers them, it goes, new x-ray cameras.
[00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:48.270]  I don't know why.
[00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.671]  So I just use that term.
[00:15:50.371 --> 00:15:56.456]  They have a technical name for them, which I can't recall exactly right now, but they actually send out hyper audio waves.
[00:15:57.077 --> 00:15:57.897]  You know, like a bat.
[00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:01.080]  You know, a bat screeches and peeps, and it bounces back.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.781]  It has sonar.
[00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:04.603]  Well, that's basically what this is, and it just shoots it out.
[00:16:04.623 --> 00:16:06.464]  It's the same thing with ground-penetrating radar.
[00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:09.527]  They got mounted on helicopters that look right through your walls or right through your car.
[00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:11.671]  Let's just lower power.
[00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:16.633]  And they can turn it to be blurred and just see if you've got a weapon, but that's not what they do.
[00:16:16.653 --> 00:16:18.934]  They want to see detail, quote, because it's more accurate.
[00:16:19.154 --> 00:16:20.094]  So you're just naked.
[00:16:20.634 --> 00:16:26.876]  You're just naked standing there with this sonar system blasting your body.
[00:16:28.437 --> 00:16:29.917]  And if you don't think that's bad enough,
[00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:46.486]  Five airports have NASA, it's been there for four years, NASA brain scan passive MRI that actually pick up brain heat signatures and they're quote using this now.
[00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:50.747]  Oh, this shows that areas of your brain associated with aggression are heated up.
[00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:52.628]  We've got to question you as being a terrorist.
[00:16:52.948 --> 00:16:55.309]  It's all pure quackery.
[00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:59.190]  And every time I mention that, people, that's ridiculous.
[00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.211]  Well, just go Google it.
[00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:01.231]  That's on my website.
[00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.595]  You haven't heard about the brain scanners?
[00:17:03.615 --> 00:17:04.235]  You didn't hear?
[00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:08.556]  They're talking about having them in mobile trucks in London.
[00:17:08.616 --> 00:17:15.579]  Oh, by the way, in England now, they have a few mobile trucks in London, where they pull up to bars and make everybody walk through the sonar machines.
[00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:20.761]  Which, again, it's like the man with the x-ray vision in the 1950s movie.
[00:17:21.101 --> 00:17:22.281]  I mean, it literally is like that.
[00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:23.902]  You just see right through the clothes.
[00:17:24.882 --> 00:17:27.843]  But instead of it being flesh-toned, you're purple and green and red-colored.
[00:17:28.624 --> 00:17:29.544]  But it's everything.
[00:17:30.643 --> 00:17:31.564]  Eh, just get used to it.
[00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:32.325]  It's the future.
[00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:33.206]  It's freedom.
[00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:35.028]  Marching through.
[00:17:35.048 --> 00:17:36.969]  You know, being scanned.
[00:17:38.951 --> 00:17:40.013]  So, uh, here it is.
[00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:42.455]  And see, you'll start seeing these every day instead of every week.
[00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:43.696]  And then it'll just become passe.
[00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:44.977]  And I won't even cover it anymore.
[00:17:45.018 --> 00:17:46.759]  It's just, oh yeah, cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:47.360]  I don't know a big deal.
[00:17:49.697 --> 00:17:54.925]  Oh yeah, the TSA now is announcing they're going to have these at the facilities and they'll just randomly wave you over.
[00:17:54.945 --> 00:17:56.568]  Excuse me, excuse me ma'am, excuse me sir.
[00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:57.810]  I need you to walk through here.
[00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.190]  Thank you.
[00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.653]  Just checking for weapons for your own safety.
[00:18:00.093 --> 00:18:02.076]  And you're going to be recorded in their database.
[00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:03.759]  Your naked body.
[00:18:05.234 --> 00:18:12.357]  And by the way, they say off of that residence they can even create a biometric image to then check against you later for, quote, your identity.
[00:18:12.597 --> 00:18:14.678]  And they have these big clothing shops all over the U.S.
[00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:23.681]  I started seeing this three years ago, where the new style and fitting is actually a biometric scan machine that scans down from your head to your feet.
[00:18:23.922 --> 00:18:26.703]  You get into it naked in the changing area.
[00:18:26.743 --> 00:18:34.606]  Ooh, all the ladies have got to have it perfect, tailoring, and all the fanciest places in New York that, you know, sell the $8,000 suits while they're starting it.
[00:18:35.166 --> 00:18:40.007]  And then you step in, and they caught one of the companies selling the data to the government.
[00:18:40.067 --> 00:18:40.447]  Guess what?
[00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:45.889]  The government had helped covertly finance some of the first stores to get it, and they care about you.
[00:18:46.449 --> 00:18:48.190]  But see, they could just make it a fad.
[00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.790]  Oh, this is how we measure you now.
[00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.531]  And then all these industries, they pay a few off to buy it.
[00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:55.251]  They have a PR campaign, and suddenly everybody buys it.
[00:18:55.752 --> 00:19:00.753]  And it's subsidized by the government, because people don't know the company they're buying it from is really an NSA front company.
[00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:08.923]  I mean, our government will spend hundreds of millions of dollars just to make sure that some biometric machine gets in the clothes shops.
[00:19:10.284 --> 00:19:11.125]  You think I'm joking?
[00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:16.508]  And then, of course, then they privately make money by giving themselves, once they're out of office, contracts to their own company.
[00:19:16.648 --> 00:19:18.609]  It's like Carlisle Group's big in biometrics.
[00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.371]  But that's how far all of this has gone.
[00:19:22.391 --> 00:19:26.353]  Now, I don't know if they put it in more than four airports.
[00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:29.075]  I know they said it's going to be in all 20 major airports.
[00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:34.950]  I know it's been in four of them for, right after 9-11.
[00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:39.172]  So, amazing.
[00:19:39.633 --> 00:19:41.094]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:42.515]  This is all happening.
[00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:46.037]  Alright, when we get back, we'll take some calls.
[00:19:46.057 --> 00:19:47.178]  How about taking some calls?

[00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:21.514]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.

[00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:07.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:11.223]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.724 --> 00:24:23.411]  Oh, by the way, I don't care if you're from Alaska, New York, Kansas, Florida, Hawaii, if you love freedom, you're my brother.
[00:24:24.052 --> 00:24:27.874]  When I do the little carpetbagger joke, you know, a carpetbagger goes both ways.
[00:24:28.475 --> 00:24:31.677]  Hillary Clinton is a carpetbagger.
[00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:36.880]  She's not from New York, never lived in New York, and she just goes up there and becomes the Senator of New York.
[00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:39.421]  That's carpetbagging.
[00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:40.721]  What is carpetbagging?
[00:24:40.742 --> 00:24:41.722]  I got an email asking me.
[00:24:43.082 --> 00:24:46.143]  The carpetbaggers came down here because they weren't completely destitute.
[00:24:46.163 --> 00:24:48.084]  They were middle-class northerners, usually.
[00:24:48.444 --> 00:24:54.726]  And the South was totally devastated, people starving to death en masse, during Reconstruction, roving bands of federal troops.
[00:24:55.446 --> 00:24:56.006]  Martial law.
[00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:57.542]  You know, publicly.
[00:24:57.582 --> 00:24:58.883]  That's why we had Posse Comitatus.
[00:24:58.983 --> 00:25:02.285]  It finally was a reform because of a second revolt that was forming.
[00:25:02.325 --> 00:25:03.626]  It was a reform of that problem.
[00:25:04.106 --> 00:25:10.151]  And the carpetbaggers all swooped down here, and they would haul back so much loot with them.
[00:25:10.171 --> 00:25:19.578]  You know, they'd come back, people starving to death, and go, we'll buy all your family's silver, because nobody had money to buy silver from other southerners, or land, or whatever it was.
[00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:22.120]  We'll buy it from you for pennies on the dollar.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.062]  Plus, all the Confederate money was worthless.
[00:25:25.871 --> 00:25:27.251]  And so only U.S.
[00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:29.852]  Greenbacks were worth something in gold and silver.
[00:25:29.872 --> 00:25:31.592]  So they had that to exchange.
[00:25:31.632 --> 00:25:35.533]  And the carpetbaggers had so much stuff, they would use carpets.
[00:25:35.573 --> 00:25:36.553]  They would use drapes.
[00:25:37.854 --> 00:25:42.415]  Just giant wagons filled with just heaps of the loot.
[00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:47.596]  And so that's where the term carpetbagger comes from.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:58.423]  So anytime, here's another example, the globalist corporations coming in using cheap labor to leverage everybody's jobs down the toilet, that's carpetbaggers.
[00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:13.187]  Now you couldn't call Mexican immigrants illegal aliens, who by and large do want to work hard, and I don't blame them, the problem is that it's a globalist operation to drive down our wages and destabilize us, that's publicly stated, you wouldn't call them carpetbaggers.
[00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:29.297]  You can call them usurpers, you can call them invaders, but when somebody comes in to try to take advantage of a situation, when somebody tries to come into your territory and leverage you and get in your face and tell you they're the boss, they're a carpetbagger.
[00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:33.062]  So in its original connotation,
[00:26:34.143 --> 00:26:44.632]  It has more to do with Northerners coming down here with carpet bags, but in the more popularized, more modern usage, it just means what I earlier described to you.
[00:26:44.972 --> 00:26:52.077]  There's the dissertation on carpet bagging, in case any carpet baggers out there didn't know what it meant because they're ignorant.
[00:26:54.902 --> 00:27:10.049]  And you could say that whites carpet-bagged the Native Americans, but you would say it more correctly if you said that whites teamed up with other Indian tribes, other Native tribes, who then together carpet-bagged the other tribes through Balkanization.
[00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:19.633]  Now I've spent too long talking about carpet-bagging, but this video is all over the web and they say that it's U.S.
[00:27:19.693 --> 00:27:21.794]  troops, but I tend to, listening to it,
[00:27:23.512 --> 00:27:29.657]  And looking at trucks that are ahead of the video in Iraq, it looks more like contractors to me.
[00:27:30.678 --> 00:27:35.842]  And most of the fuel and most of the water being driven around is via Halliburton subcontracts.
[00:27:37.643 --> 00:27:38.924]  Brown and Root contracts.
[00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:40.505]  And they look like contractors.
[00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:43.728]  The inside of the truck looks like a contractor 18-wheeler.
[00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:45.970]  And then these kids are throwing rocks at them.
[00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.171]  Little rocks.
[00:27:48.632 --> 00:27:50.773]  And they look like maybe 10-year-old kids.
[00:27:51.094 --> 00:27:52.575]  Too stupid to know how dangerous it is.
[00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:54.272]  Well, they've got a lot of courage.
[00:27:54.652 --> 00:27:59.015]  And they're throwing rocks at the 18-wheelers as they drive by.
[00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:09.922]  And then you see this troop truck pull comes sliding up by the kids and they run out and the kids run and I believe watching the video you see them grab one, but it's at a distance.
[00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:11.851]  And they go, yeah, U.S.
[00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:13.352]  military, that's our security.
[00:28:13.773 --> 00:28:16.977]  So that's why I think it's contractors.
[00:28:17.498 --> 00:28:22.684]  And then one of the folks up here at the office says, Alex, you're buying into the Orwellian conditioning.
[00:28:22.704 --> 00:28:27.410]  You're letting your semantical lexicon be altered and changed.
[00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.931]  And I said, how?
[00:28:28.718 --> 00:28:31.600]  And he rightfully said, uh, you're calling them contractors.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.721]  See, I tend to use the term that people are able to interface with.
[00:28:35.201 --> 00:28:38.203]  Clearly, up until just a few years ago, they would not be called contractors.
[00:28:38.563 --> 00:28:40.304]  They are mercenaries.
[00:28:40.404 --> 00:28:41.625]  They are mercs.
[00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:46.267]  But really, I think there's a line there.
[00:28:47.568 --> 00:28:52.711]  Could you call people driving fuel, driving oil, driving water, could you call them contractors?
[00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:53.651]  They're not armed.
[00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:54.952]  I think they should be.
[00:28:55.932 --> 00:28:56.933]  And they're being shot at.
[00:28:58.075 --> 00:29:00.097]  Well, even that is a new phenomenon.
[00:29:00.157 --> 00:29:09.025]  I mean, we really shouldn't have contractors, because it allows, it's even easier for bigwigs and governments to give their buddies contracts at jacked-up prices.
[00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:10.386]  And there's no bids allowed, by the way.
[00:29:11.027 --> 00:29:12.488]  And then that got spun in the media.
[00:29:12.588 --> 00:29:14.190]  Oh, well, we're not giving the French bids.
[00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.471]  Forget the foreigners.
[00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:17.713]  It's not just foreigners where bids weren't allowed.
[00:29:18.033 --> 00:29:20.476]  Bids weren't allowed, period, for the last two years.
[00:29:22.219 --> 00:29:22.599]  Okay?
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.100]  To American companies.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.742]  So, there's a problem with these mercenaries.
[00:29:26.802 --> 00:29:41.291]  But clearly, the Blackwaters and the Titans and the others, the agents of the world, they clearly are mercenaries, which has always been seen as an unsavory, despicable mob of soldiers for fortune.
[00:29:42.232 --> 00:29:49.096]  But nowadays, you know, Don King, a murdering racketeer, is worshipped and loves Bush, so everything must be okay.
[00:29:49.116 --> 00:29:49.817]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:52.588]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.048 --> 00:29:54.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.589 --> 00:29:58.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.413 --> 00:30:03.394]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.

[00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:11.918]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:13.659]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.961]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:30:16.141 --> 00:30:19.703]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:30:20.023 --> 00:30:22.045]  And they can do it without due process.
[00:30:22.105 --> 00:30:29.051]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.

[00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:29.246]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.446 --> 00:32:30.667]  There are no side effects.

[00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:24.205]  Getting back into the contractors and the troops, in this video clip that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:33:25.306 --> 00:33:29.488]  The point of the clip is, they're driving along and these little kids are throwing rocks at them.
[00:33:30.349 --> 00:33:41.054]  And they start talking about, and we can't play the clip because it's all profanity, they talk about how they want to kill them, how they want to be able to shoot them, how they wish they were authorized to, when they throw a rock at them, kill them, which they do do in Israel.
[00:33:43.115 --> 00:33:43.836]  And you know what?
[00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:48.279]  I mean, certainly the kids should probably get in trouble and be taken to the local police station.
[00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:50.060]  The problem is they'll get tortured there.
[00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:51.842]  And they do get arrested.
[00:33:51.902 --> 00:33:55.905]  I mean, you see the big army vehicle come screeching up, almost running over them.
[00:33:56.806 --> 00:33:57.806]  They're throwing rocks at them.
[00:33:57.846 --> 00:33:58.687]  So here comes U.S.
[00:33:58.707 --> 00:34:01.970]  troops in a troop truck, jumping out and chasing after them.
[00:34:06.349 --> 00:34:10.390]  But there's another wrinkle in this story, another little angle to it.
[00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.151]  I thought it's rose petals were all loved over there.
[00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:18.833]  It's just, why they're all out voting on ballots that supposedly have been shipped in by Iran.
[00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:20.213]  If you believe that, give me a break.
[00:34:20.813 --> 00:34:24.675]  Just one more lie from the father of lies that these people are controlled by.
[00:34:26.435 --> 00:34:32.317]  But under that we have the clip of the troops and the Abrams tank crew, a family in a little car.
[00:34:32.337 --> 00:34:34.218]  They catch them stealing a piece of wood out of a field.
[00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.258]  You're not allowed to take wood.
[00:34:36.447 --> 00:34:40.569]  And the city's burning around them and they say, why aren't your kids in school?
[00:34:40.749 --> 00:34:42.530]  This is during the takeover of Baghdad.
[00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:48.192]  And then they run the car over with an Abrams tank after machine-gunning it and laughing.
[00:34:49.593 --> 00:34:51.814]  And this is what you get when you loot.
[00:34:51.874 --> 00:34:52.734]  We've played that many times.
[00:34:53.295 --> 00:34:55.656]  And below that we have contractors from Asia.
[00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:56.836]  They now admit it.
[00:34:57.256 --> 00:34:58.737]  Just randomly shooting cars.
[00:34:58.777 --> 00:35:00.918]  Just cars driving down the road and they're just laughing.
[00:35:01.776 --> 00:35:05.319]  And just shooting and watching the cars wreck, bodies falling out.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:12.345]  And live on Fox TV as, and that was just a few weeks ago that happened, but live as they were invading Baghdad, there was no one resisting.
[00:35:12.365 --> 00:35:16.728]  They'd paid off the army grips, they'd paid off almost all the Republican Guard Generals, that's now admitted.
[00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:20.812]  No one was really resisting, until they got right in around the palaces.
[00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:25.341]  And they're just driving down the road, and it looks like L.A., palm trees, everything.
[00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:44.588]  And our troops are just shooting across the median into delivery trucks, cars, and you'll see the windshield with 50 bullets, you know, 50 holes appear in it, and then people are falling out bloody, and the troops are laughing and hooraying, and this was being aired on Fox like this was normal.
[00:35:44.608 --> 00:35:49.510]  And then we're hearing, well, some of those could be suicide trucks, and we just, I mean, imagine.
[00:35:51.932 --> 00:36:20.422]  Six o'clock in the afternoon, summertime, over there, you know, hot day, just driving into the city, really the spring, just driving into the city, and just mowing everything down that moves, and it's not my opinion, I mean, I taped it off TV, they had little satellite phone internet feeds of it, it was just nightmarish to watch that, and then under that, we have
[00:36:21.505 --> 00:36:24.568]  Just a bunch of other video of them killing people and laughing about it.
[00:36:24.628 --> 00:36:30.052]  In front of reporters, our troops will just shoot little kids and then laugh about it.
[00:36:30.152 --> 00:36:34.075]  And the reporters scream out, British and American, right in front of the Baghdad Hotel.
[00:36:34.115 --> 00:36:34.856]  What did you just do?
[00:36:34.876 --> 00:36:35.897]  You just killed a child.
[00:36:36.137 --> 00:36:36.597]  That's right!
[00:36:36.617 --> 00:36:37.678]  And I want to kill more!
[00:36:37.818 --> 00:36:38.018]  Hoo!
[00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:38.339]  Hoo!
[00:36:38.459 --> 00:36:38.639]  Hoo!
[00:36:38.759 --> 00:36:38.939]  Hoo!
[00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:39.239]  Hoo!
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:39.520]  Hoo!
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:39.800]  Hoo!
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.120]  Hoo!
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.882]  That's not what men do.
[00:36:41.962 --> 00:36:47.987]  Start barking, you know, Marine Corps barks, devil dog barks at, I want to kill more kids.
[00:36:49.528 --> 00:36:50.909]  And you can't cover this up.
[00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:53.658]  You just don't like our troops, boy.
[00:36:54.018 --> 00:36:56.800]  I'm not the one that making them breathe DU, play uranium.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.501]  I'm not the one giving them experimental shots.
[00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:02.142]  I'm not the one that makes them pay for their own socks and makes them water their own clothes.
[00:37:02.483 --> 00:37:03.543]  I'm not the one doing all this.
[00:37:03.583 --> 00:37:06.805]  I'm not the one that ships them back like freight and doesn't even give them a proper burial.
[00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:11.825]  I'm not the one that lied about WMDs.
[00:37:11.945 --> 00:37:13.626]  I'm not the one that put Saddam into power.
[00:37:13.646 --> 00:37:15.168]  I'm not the one that told him to invade Iran.
[00:37:15.388 --> 00:37:16.789]  I'm not the one that told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:20.233]  I'm the one that gave him bio-weapons and chemical weapons.
[00:37:20.353 --> 00:37:21.194]  Donald Rumsfeld did.
[00:37:21.634 --> 00:37:22.515]  I'm not the one.
[00:37:22.855 --> 00:37:24.176]  So I don't want to hear it anymore.
[00:37:24.236 --> 00:37:30.843]  It's... Even if you believe the 9-11 fable, which is a total military-industrial complex fabrication.
[00:37:30.903 --> 00:37:32.104]  We have their own documents on it.
[00:37:32.304 --> 00:37:33.045]  Then all the evidence.
[00:37:34.927 --> 00:37:37.788]  Even if you believe that fable, Iraq's the wrong country.
[00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:44.969]  And again, most of the people that want to invade Iraq and want to kill everybody cannot even find Iraq on a map.
[00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:47.770]  Let's just go to calls and then I'll get back into the news.
[00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.450]  Chris in California.
[00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.090]  Hi, how's it going?
[00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:51.710]  Good, sir.
[00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:53.371]  Thanks for having me.
[00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:55.271]  Thanks for calling.
[00:37:57.151 --> 00:38:01.932]  I've newly woken up, you could say.
[00:38:02.453 --> 00:38:04.633]  I first watched the Power Hour on
[00:38:05.148 --> 00:38:33.828]  They put on public access and uh... recently been downloading all the videos and stuff uh... off the internet and uh... just kind of kind of taken me and it's uh... I don't even know what to really say it's just it's kind of consumed what I'm doing and uh... and last night I uh... downloaded the Patriot Act and kind of a breakdown that you had on uh... Ricky Lee Jones and I'm having a bit of a trouble
[00:38:34.403 --> 00:38:35.363]  Trying to interpret it.
[00:38:36.704 --> 00:38:38.004]  The actual Patriot Act.
[00:38:39.745 --> 00:38:43.326]  Well, now I did an analysis of the first Patriot Act.
[00:38:43.386 --> 00:38:44.887]  I did one of Patriot Act II.
[00:38:44.907 --> 00:38:47.527]  I did one of the Victory Act, the Intelligence Enhancement Act.
[00:38:47.928 --> 00:38:53.389]  So I don't know which specific... Do you have the bill itself or a section by section analysis?
[00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.131]  I actually have the bill itself, I believe.
[00:38:57.171 --> 00:38:59.371]  It's like on a PDF format.
[00:38:59.532 --> 00:38:59.912]  Is it H.R. 3162?
[00:39:04.847 --> 00:39:05.868]  Not sure exactly.
[00:39:05.888 --> 00:39:07.529]  Yeah, I really can't.
[00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.632]  That would be the first past version, October 27, 2001.
[00:39:11.352 --> 00:39:14.995]  So I would have to see what you're looking at.
[00:39:15.816 --> 00:39:16.136]  Okay.
[00:39:17.097 --> 00:39:24.363]  Okay, well that's okay.
[00:39:24.483 --> 00:39:25.644]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:31.769]  The other thing is, I'm obviously not the greatest speaker in the world.
[00:39:33.729 --> 00:39:36.132]  I'm glad you're involved in the fight.
[00:39:36.152 --> 00:39:39.455]  A lot of times newcomers are around the age of 18.
[00:39:50.117 --> 00:40:00.144]  You don't have to be the best speaker in the world, and you probably shouldn't be out doing a whole lot of trying to proselytize until you're really educated on things, which you can do in a few months.
[00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:06.908]  You can get a crash course understanding what the New World Order is, what's happening, what empires are, what tyranny is.
[00:40:06.928 --> 00:40:08.929]  I would read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:40:08.969 --> 00:40:10.971]  That's a good idea, a good place to start.
[00:40:12.232 --> 00:40:18.636]  But you saw, I would guess, one of David Joyce's documentaries
[00:40:19.762 --> 00:40:21.023]  On local access TV.
[00:40:21.063 --> 00:40:23.886]  Well, what I would challenge you to do is go get your own access TV show.
[00:40:24.226 --> 00:40:26.389]  There are hundreds of great documentaries and videos.
[00:40:26.409 --> 00:40:27.230]  Put those on.
[00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.771]  Get involved in the fight.
[00:40:28.851 --> 00:40:31.614]  Be educating yourself while you're airing them.
[00:40:31.634 --> 00:40:33.817]  Or get some of my films.
[00:40:34.257 --> 00:40:35.359]  Make copies of them.
[00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:36.960]  Say, hey, check this out.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.422]  It's important to your future.
[00:40:38.802 --> 00:40:41.165]  And then let the experts do the talking for you.
[00:40:41.932 --> 00:40:58.602]  And then start reading some books on the subject, start researching, visiting the websites every day, and in a few months you won't be a novice anymore, and you'll be really informed, but you're already doing the right thing, going and looking at legislation, and getting involved, and I can only commend you.
[00:40:59.522 --> 00:41:07.407]  Yeah, I've always been a regular news watcher, and I've always had that feeling that
[00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:20.777]  There's always so much more going on than what was telling me and just recently just kind of flicked and all this other information's coming in and just trying to decipher it all.
[00:41:21.597 --> 00:41:24.219]  Now I understand and I appreciate your call.
[00:41:24.279 --> 00:41:30.262]  Something you've also got to do, Chris, is don't believe everything I say.
[00:41:30.743 --> 00:41:36.666]  I want you to trust, to steal Reagan's term, trust but verify.
[00:41:37.876 --> 00:41:39.757]  Because I want you to check out what I'm saying.
[00:41:39.837 --> 00:41:41.638]  I want you to find out I'm the real deal.
[00:41:42.018 --> 00:41:45.300]  And I want you to check out what other people are saying, and I want you to find out they're liars.
[00:41:46.441 --> 00:41:50.463]  And you've also got to watch out, you know, if we're the resistance, we're going to be infiltrated.
[00:41:51.564 --> 00:41:58.588]  And so a lot of the stuff you see on the web that gets into things we can't prove, that gets into all this nebulous business,
[00:41:59.554 --> 00:42:00.575]  It's hard to stay out of it.
[00:42:00.615 --> 00:42:01.556]  I mean, it's hard for me to.
[00:42:01.576 --> 00:42:05.740]  Because it's so prevalent, and it's popular, and it's sexy, and people like it.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.225]  But you really gotta stick to what's real, what can be proven, and that's bizarre beyond belief.
[00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:20.894]  I mean, all these public officials and bigwigs and top TV hosts and radio hosts saying every child needs a microchip, and Bush cabinet members saying every child needs a microchip.
[00:42:20.914 --> 00:42:22.275]  I mean, that's going on.
[00:42:23.027 --> 00:42:27.270]  You know, Mexican Attorney Generals ordering all his employees to get into the building to take microchips.
[00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.091]  I mean, that's real.
[00:42:29.231 --> 00:42:32.853]  And people will have trouble believing that if you send them down and show them news clips of it.
[00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:34.634]  Or send them down and show them news articles.
[00:42:36.255 --> 00:42:37.576]  Because it's so weird.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:52.519]  And then you've got just outright COINTELPRO individuals who just run around attacking other patriots and run around telling people there's no hope and telling people that nothing can be done and especially spreading dislike of other races and groups.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.603]  They do that to balkanize us.
[00:42:55.223 --> 00:43:08.410]  And whereas I'll criticize the racist groups that are out there, I'll criticize the Meches and the Little Razzas and the black groups and the white groups, but then it's okay to expose all that stuff, but I'm talking about reveling in it, or joining in and all of it.
[00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.911]  The globalists then just divide and conquer us.
[00:43:11.492 --> 00:43:13.293]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:43:13.313 --> 00:43:20.716]  I was about to go to Mike in Arizona, but he just hung up, so let's go to Reuben in Ohio.
[00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:21.737]  Reuben, you're on the air.
[00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:37.778]  Alex, after September 11th, I think one of the news anchors mentioned something I saw in a magazine and I've never heard of it since, and that's an object going from the ground up towards the Twin Towers before they collapsed.
[00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:38.199]  Do you know what?
[00:43:38.379 --> 00:43:39.920]  Are you familiar with what I'm referring to?
[00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:47.126]  Well, I know there were jets flying around, clearly some F-16s streaked by after the second plane impacts.
[00:43:48.999 --> 00:44:10.607]  And I know that there were a lot of other reports of explosions and squibs, that is, ejection points from the blast going off inside the buildings, but there's all this talk of missiles and talk of pods and all of that, and you know, we've discussed it, but I tend to just stick, again, to what we can totally prove.
[00:44:10.627 --> 00:44:17.789]  And then people get mad at me for deciding to stick to my own orthodoxy, whereas I don't criticize people.
[00:44:18.965 --> 00:44:25.768]  For getting off into other areas, I just want to be able to have my views and not be criticized by our supposed own movement on those.
[00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:29.910]  You know, a lot of these people say, don't criticize my view, but I'm going to criticize your view.
[00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.911]  I stick to the public officials being warned not to fly.
[00:44:33.909 --> 00:44:35.449]  I stick to Norad standing down.
[00:44:35.929 --> 00:44:37.090]  I stick to official U.S.
[00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.070]  government plans to carry out 9-11.
[00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:46.712]  I stick to Bush standing down with the Secret Service for 26 minutes, and then even more time after that, there in Florida.
[00:44:47.112 --> 00:44:49.252]  I stick to Bin Laden being known as the CIA.
[00:44:49.773 --> 00:44:52.693]  I stick to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda being protected and being flown out.
[00:44:53.113 --> 00:45:00.855]  I stick to the supposed hijackers trained at the Defense Language School at Monterey, California, and their own dean of the school saying they were some type of government operatives.
[00:45:01.215 --> 00:45:01.635]  I don't know.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.064]  Powers that our military's had since 57, away from the military.
[00:45:24.844 --> 00:45:41.919]  I stick to the clear bombs in the buildings, and the firefighters saying bombs, and the seismographs showing bombs, and Building 7 not being hit, and the small fires, and a perfect control demolition, and the central column being imploded first, and the blast points, the explosions actually going off, you can see them.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.963]  I stick to Larry Silverstein slipping up and saying he blew the building up.
[00:45:46.923 --> 00:45:53.187]  I stick to tripod two and the drills that morning and how they admittedly were running a drill and running the operation from there on the ground.
[00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:57.609]  There are hundreds of points that there's no weeviling around.
[00:45:57.969 --> 00:46:04.233]  There's hundreds of points that are concrete, pun intended, that cannot be debated.
[00:46:05.013 --> 00:46:08.775]  The aerosolization of the concrete, of the steel, all of that.
[00:46:10.036 --> 00:46:12.177]  That's what I choose to expose.
[00:46:12.217 --> 00:46:12.737]  And you know what?
[00:46:12.997 --> 00:46:13.958]  I think I
[00:46:15.223 --> 00:46:16.063]  Profoundly.
[00:46:16.323 --> 00:46:27.626]  People told me, Ruben, that I don't go to the 9-11 Truth Meetings, I don't go to these events, I don't prance around and fight with everyone and say, this is the right way, that's the right way.
[00:46:28.707 --> 00:46:30.287]  Because really, that's not where the battle is.
[00:46:30.307 --> 00:46:32.367]  The battle's on talk radio, the battle's on the internet.
[00:46:32.668 --> 00:46:41.230]  In the time it took me to go to some meeting to talk to 500 people, I can talk to millions right now, and I can talk to a couple million tonight on an interview on a big show, instead of doing that.
[00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:41.990]  But at the same time,
[00:46:42.893 --> 00:46:58.781]  People who were calling me a kook for saying 9-11 was an inside job for the first year of the event, or two years of the event, or three years of the event, have now set themselves up as the leaders of it, and then tell me what I should and shouldn't cover.
[00:46:59.141 --> 00:47:02.323]  And I won't put up with that, because there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:47:02.363 --> 00:47:03.183]  Everybody knows it.
[00:47:03.483 --> 00:47:04.684]  I talked about it two months before.
[00:47:04.724 --> 00:47:07.966]  I talked about it on the day of the event, and got a lot of heat for it.
[00:47:08.106 --> 00:47:10.027]  I am the father of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:47:10.347 --> 00:47:12.548]  Yeah, you're the godfather to the granddaddy.
[00:47:13.428 --> 00:47:15.829]  Well, I don't even like having that position.
[00:47:15.869 --> 00:47:17.129]  It's quite frankly dangerous.
[00:47:17.929 --> 00:47:19.210]  And I don't like having it.
[00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.771]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:22.211 --> 00:47:23.551]  It's been thrust upon you.
[00:47:23.611 --> 00:47:26.212]  Well, I did charge up the hill first and there's no debating it.
[00:47:26.272 --> 00:47:32.054]  And then I got a bunch of people who waited until we took the hill and now they got the nerve when I don't even want the medals.
[00:47:32.114 --> 00:47:32.794]  Here's the analogy.
[00:47:33.094 --> 00:47:34.254]  I don't even want the medals.
[00:47:34.294 --> 00:47:35.155]  I don't care about them.
[00:47:35.535 --> 00:47:40.436]  But then I got to watch somebody else prance up to the top and tell everybody how he took out the enemy machine gunners.
[00:47:40.956 --> 00:47:41.757]  It's just not true.
[00:47:44.246 --> 00:47:46.927]  There's another 9-11 point I want to bring to your attention.
[00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:57.411]  Alex, I was watching this video called The Corporation, and I have it queued up where the stockholder talks about how the price of gold doubled during 9-11.
[00:47:57.452 --> 00:47:58.332]  Can I play it for you?
[00:47:59.032 --> 00:47:59.632]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:47:59.652 --> 00:48:00.653]  Okay, here we go.
[00:48:00.673 --> 00:48:05.055]  It's two minutes long, and then he says something interesting about Iraq.
[00:48:06.835 --> 00:48:07.936]  I've got to be honest with you.
[00:48:08.416 --> 00:48:10.457]  When the September 11 situation happened,
[00:48:11.832 --> 00:48:22.155]  I didn't know that, and I must say, and I want to say this because it's, I want to take it lightly, it's not a light situation.
[00:48:22.175 --> 00:48:24.776]  A devastating act.
[00:48:25.837 --> 00:48:28.437]  It was really a bad thing.
[00:48:28.577 --> 00:48:31.398]  It was one of the worst things I've seen in my lifetime, you know.
[00:48:31.939 --> 00:48:36.220]  But, I will tell you, and every traitor will tell you, was not in that building.
[00:48:37.065 --> 00:48:40.286]  And who was buying gold and who owned gold and silver?
[00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:45.649]  Now, when it happened, the first thing you thought about was, well, how much is gold up?
[00:48:47.169 --> 00:48:50.691]  The first thing that came to mind was, my God, gold must be exploding!
[00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:54.312]  Fortunately for us, all our clients were in gold.
[00:48:55.653 --> 00:48:57.634]  So when it went up, they all doubled their money!
[00:48:58.974 --> 00:48:59.995]  Everybody doubled their money!
[00:49:01.756 --> 00:49:03.176]  It was a blessing in disguise!
[00:49:04.157 --> 00:49:04.817]  Devastating!
[00:49:09.527 --> 00:49:19.734]  Well, I'll tell ya, that's all I can play of that because the audio quality isn't the best and I'm not familiar with the, I believe it's a documentary called The Corporation.
[00:49:20.034 --> 00:49:21.895]  Yeah, that was Carlton Brown.
[00:49:22.736 --> 00:49:26.178]  And then he talks about in 91 how the price of oil went from $13 to $30 after we attacked.
[00:49:29.252 --> 00:49:30.013]  I've heard of that film.
[00:49:30.033 --> 00:49:31.694]  Will you send me a copy of it please?
[00:49:45.678 --> 00:49:49.219]  You know there were hundreds of millions, it was admitted, of gold in those towers.
[00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:51.140]  Gold does not disappear.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.460]  Gold is not damaged.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:50:03.783]  Gold will not evaporate until, it's something ridiculous like 10,000 degrees or something, and even then it condenses back down to its original hard state.
[00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:08.865]  I forget which temperature it turns to gas, but it's... It was a bank robbery.
[00:50:09.145 --> 00:50:09.685]  Exactly.
[00:50:09.705 --> 00:50:12.186]  The point is, where is all that gold exactly?
[00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:14.980]  I mean, where is it?
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.661]  Where is the gold?
[00:50:17.301 --> 00:50:18.902]  You know what else is interesting, Alex?
[00:50:20.223 --> 00:50:22.645]  Those towers were named after the Rockefellers, right?
[00:50:22.985 --> 00:50:24.086]  Yes, Rockefeller Center.
[00:50:26.428 --> 00:50:34.774]  There's one Rockefeller Center down the road, and then that's the Rockefeller Port Authority, but they sold out of the Rockefeller Port Authority three months before 9-11.
[00:50:34.814 --> 00:50:35.494]  Very convenient.
[00:50:35.934 --> 00:50:39.297]  Have you ever seen the Rockefellers interviewed on how they felt about that day?
[00:50:40.808 --> 00:50:41.409]  No, we haven't.
[00:50:41.429 --> 00:50:43.070]  You bring up a lot of good points, Reuben.
[00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:43.930]  Call back anytime.
[00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:44.531]  God bless you.
[00:50:45.632 --> 00:50:53.497]  And we'll talk to Mike and Chris and Cliff and many others when we get back.
[00:50:53.537 --> 00:50:55.999]  And we've got Dean Haglund coming up in about 40 minutes.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.301]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.586 --> 00:51:05.428]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.689 --> 00:51:07.270]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:12.274]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.614 --> 00:51:19.360]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.661]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:24.722]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.802 --> 00:51:29.463]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.663 --> 00:51:34.064]  Marshall Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.325 --> 00:51:41.547]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.787 --> 00:51:44.208]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:45.828]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Marshall Law.

[00:54:09.611 --> 00:54:12.292]  My job is hard, but it's also easy.
[00:54:14.353 --> 00:54:20.275]  I mean, there's so much corruption, there's so much evil, there's so much wickedness, so much lying.
[00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.916]  Such a police state being set up.
[00:54:23.016 --> 00:54:25.137]  Classical tyranny being erected around us.
[00:54:25.477 --> 00:54:28.098]  The cage is built.
[00:54:28.758 --> 00:54:32.059]  But then it's also hard to try to articulate all that.
[00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:33.139]  I mean, it's exhausting.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.560]  It's ridiculous.
[00:54:37.213 --> 00:54:42.374]  But then I listen to regular talk radio, whether it's liberal or conservative talk radio, and it's just mindlessness.
[00:54:43.075 --> 00:54:44.235]  It's no real issues.
[00:54:44.295 --> 00:54:49.916]  It's just giggling, simplistic, two-dimensional garbage.
[00:54:49.936 --> 00:54:51.617]  Well, this is a three-dimensional broadcast.
[00:54:51.637 --> 00:54:53.057]  We get in-depth.
[00:54:53.077 --> 00:54:59.159]  We get into the real nature of man, the real nature of human societies, what's happening.
[00:54:59.179 --> 00:55:03.160]  And we're going to go to Chris and Patrick and others here in a moment.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.300]  Just briefly, I'm going to tell you,
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.702]  That I am a documentary filmmaker, and I have made my fourteenth film.
[00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:11.704]  And that is The Order of Death.
[00:55:11.784 --> 00:55:13.005]  And I'm very proud of it.
[00:55:13.285 --> 00:55:16.787]  New footage inside Bohemian Grove, inside the Owl, where they do the sacrifice.
[00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:27.173]  We have new footage inside all over the Grove, inside buildings, inside some of the members, inside some of the meetings they're having, inside some of the buildings they have meetings at.
[00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:29.794]  It's not like a colonoscopy.
[00:55:29.814 --> 00:55:31.475]  We don't actually put the camera inside of them.
[00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:33.156]  Okay, joke, folks.
[00:55:35.422 --> 00:55:36.823]  A joke on something I said.
[00:55:37.523 --> 00:55:40.024]  But it really is a good video.
[00:55:40.064 --> 00:55:41.084]  It's 45 minutes long.
[00:55:41.144 --> 00:55:43.745]  It's tailored to wake somebody up that's never heard of this stuff.
[00:55:44.146 --> 00:55:45.526]  But it also gets really into depth.
[00:55:45.546 --> 00:55:46.647]  The history of the Illuminati.
[00:55:47.027 --> 00:55:50.088]  Tie-ins with degenerate groups like the Ku Klux Klan and others.
[00:55:50.908 --> 00:55:53.009]  And right through to Jesse Jackson.
[00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:54.930]  You want to see this film.
[00:55:55.547 --> 00:56:08.634]  You want to see this film and then the second half is my re-edited remastered Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove brought up to speed and cut down for over two hours to an hour and a half much more watchable it's excellent now it was a good video before but
[00:56:09.207 --> 00:56:12.089]  I made it in a hurry, you know, in three weeks because I just got out of the grove.
[00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:13.569]  Well, now I spent months redoing it.
[00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:22.114]  So, two films, the new film and the original film updated $24.95, each additional copy $9.95 on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:56:22.454 --> 00:56:26.776]  Bunch of different specials on all the videos, the books, the books on tape, the t-shirts.
[00:56:27.216 --> 00:56:32.539]  I carry a lot of other books and videos by other wonderful authors and researchers on VHS and DVD.
[00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:36.381]  Go to InfoWars.com, peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[00:56:48.587 --> 00:56:51.348]  Just shy of six months free.
[00:56:52.009 --> 00:56:52.409]  That's right.
[00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:54.290]  Six months free.
[00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:57.311]  You pay for six months, you get a full year.
[00:56:57.611 --> 00:57:00.513]  And we're going to be a two year anniversary coming up here in April.
[00:57:00.553 --> 00:57:02.414]  So just three months shy of two years.
[00:57:03.721 --> 00:57:10.225]  So, again, PrisonPlanet.TV to get a membership and see it all online, or you can simply download it.
[00:57:10.265 --> 00:57:11.346]  It's a great activist tool.
[00:57:12.406 --> 00:57:15.648]  I cannot stress enough what you can do with PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:57:17.049 --> 00:57:22.272]  You can download all the videos, the books, the information, the other videos, download them and burn them onto CD.
[00:57:22.312 --> 00:57:28.216]  My Whitley TV reports, the special video reports we do, stuff that isn't even on the TV show is on the website.
[00:57:29.482 --> 00:57:30.162]  It's all there.
[00:57:30.222 --> 00:57:31.523]  All the best audio interviews.
[00:57:31.563 --> 00:57:33.943]  You can burn them onto CD or DVD.
[00:57:34.703 --> 00:57:36.264]  Load them down onto your iPod.
[00:57:37.164 --> 00:57:38.164]  Your vodcast.
[00:57:38.204 --> 00:57:38.964]  It's already there.
[00:57:39.084 --> 00:57:42.705]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:49.007]  And to be specific, it's not the full vodcast yet where it automatically downloads without you going and physically doing it.
[00:57:49.247 --> 00:57:50.407]  But we're going to add vodcasts.
[00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:53.428]  Of course, it does have podcasts for the last six months or so.
[00:57:53.468 --> 00:57:55.348]  But we're going to have vodcasts in the next few months.
[00:57:55.708 --> 00:57:58.569]  Just thinking about how to package it right to really work good for you.
[00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:05.287]  It's going to take more work on our part to have some of the free vodcasts, so I'm having to get some staff in order for that.
[00:58:05.868 --> 00:58:07.669]  But the point is, even more.
[00:58:07.689 --> 00:58:08.870]  It just gets bigger and better.
[00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:14.894]  PrisonPlanet.tv, or call toll-free to get hard copies that can answer all your questions of any of the books and videos.

[00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:35.977]  Many hands make light work.
[00:58:36.037 --> 00:58:37.298]  Your call straight ahead.
[00:58:37.439 --> 00:58:39.020]  Masses of news and a great guest.

[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.300]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:00.001]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:01.842]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.482 --> 00:59:03.323]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:04.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.963 --> 00:59:09.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.805 --> 00:59:13.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.728 --> 00:59:22.451]  You know, it's not that big of a deal on the surface, but it's an illustration of just how sick we've gotten.
[00:59:24.904 --> 00:59:27.106]  Don King is a convicted murderer.
[00:59:27.566 --> 00:59:29.667]  He was a loan shark enforcer.
[00:59:29.687 --> 00:59:34.510]  The evidence is he beat two people to death, but he was convicted of killing one person.
[00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:37.692]  I mean, he is a mean criminal hombre.
[00:59:37.752 --> 00:59:38.633]  He's an el jefe.
[00:59:39.633 --> 00:59:42.915]  And he has a monopoly over boxing in this country.
[00:59:43.576 --> 00:59:46.278]  And is a mafioso by every definition.
[00:59:46.998 --> 00:59:48.059]  Big friends with the Bushes.
[00:59:48.099 --> 00:59:49.179]  They hang out together.
[00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:50.400]  They lavish each other.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.461]  It's well known.
[00:59:52.972 --> 00:59:53.853]  George Bush Sr.
[00:59:53.913 --> 00:59:55.674]  and King are big buddies.
[00:59:55.694 --> 00:59:59.376]  They even have been known to vacation at the same spots together and hang out.
[01:00:00.357 --> 01:00:01.457]  Crooks are crooks, folks.
[01:00:01.537 --> 01:00:02.518]  It's a big joke to them.
[01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:08.061]  And he's coming out to defend George W. He's a good American.
[01:00:08.081 --> 01:00:09.002]  A revolutionary.
[01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:09.842]  And he is a revolutionary.
[01:00:09.862 --> 01:00:10.863]  He's killing this country.
[01:00:11.263 --> 01:00:13.725]  For big fat criminals like you, you piece of trash.
[01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:16.266]  So I'll get into that after the break.
[01:00:16.306 --> 01:00:17.227]  And just a lot of other news.
[01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:18.628]  Dean Hagelin, the Hollywood star.
[01:00:19.592 --> 01:00:27.577]  One of the top stars on X-Files for nine seasons, Amlom Gunman, and scores of other credits on TV and in films.
[01:00:27.617 --> 01:00:29.678]  He should be in studio scheduled.
[01:00:30.578 --> 01:00:31.218]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:00:31.238 --> 01:00:31.999]  You're doing a great job.
[01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.199]  I've called numerous times before.
[01:00:58.258 --> 01:01:04.901]  Like I've said before, I spent three years out in the 82nd Airborne Division, and this is all non-classified information.
[01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:09.604]  You can find it in any military book if you want to research about it.
[01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:22.990]  Katrina really bothers me because the 82nd Airborne Division can be anywhere in the world within 72 hours, and it can drop several combat-ready brigades
[01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:25.602]  We're good to go.
[01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:51.056]  In an American city, and they nearly starved to death.
[01:01:51.216 --> 01:01:53.358]  Well, there's no debating it.
[01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:54.959]  I don't know about the levees being blown.
[01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:56.620]  And again, everybody focuses on that.
[01:01:57.221 --> 01:02:00.403]  I know FEMA jammed police communications as the storm hit.
[01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:08.629]  I know they cut police communications and the police had to, at gunpoint, restrain them, and three parishes guard their facilities from them.
[01:02:09.089 --> 01:02:13.833]  I know that there was food, three days after, piled up in front of the Superdome,
[01:02:14.854 --> 01:02:18.896]  And they would not let them bring the food into them, and that was not shown on the news.
[01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:26.201]  I know they sabotaged it on purpose, and now the memos have come out that, oh, FEMA knew response was broken day one.
[01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.642]  And they spin it like, oh, they knew they were idiots.
[01:02:28.722 --> 01:02:28.942]  No.
[01:02:29.463 --> 01:02:35.346]  They knew by screwing up, even if they get a public spanking, they get massive increased powers and increased funds.
[01:02:35.467 --> 01:02:37.788]  It was cynically done.
[01:02:37.848 --> 01:02:38.549]  We know that.
[01:02:39.802 --> 01:02:41.623]  I wouldn't let the police in to help people.
[01:02:41.943 --> 01:02:56.351]  Well, I saw a local report on our local Little Rock News where they, FEMA has, in the state of Arkansas, they've got 60 trailers plus, more than that, but they've got like 60 trailers fully hooked up, ready to go.
[01:02:56.671 --> 01:03:01.454]  Two days after Walmart was stopped from letting its trucks drive in and bring food to people.
[01:03:01.594 --> 01:03:03.375]  Ready to be used and there are
[01:03:04.324 --> 01:03:09.367]  Evacuees from Katrina who are having to pay and they're staying in hotel rooms.
[01:03:09.507 --> 01:03:15.430]  But don't worry, we've got plenty of the new Viper teams from the airports to patrol our streets and shake us down.
[01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:16.190]  Don't you feel safe?
[01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:21.533]  Well Alex, they're in hotels and they're a mile away from where the trailers are.
[01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:23.494]  But FEMA won't let anybody use them.
[01:03:23.514 --> 01:03:24.554]  They're just sitting right there.
[01:03:24.574 --> 01:03:25.955]  And that's disgusting.
[01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.096]  That's extremely disgusting.
[01:03:28.116 --> 01:03:30.197]  But I mean, you understand, it's just like Iraq.
[01:03:30.757 --> 01:03:35.298]  Do the corporations make more money if they're a decade and, quote, fail, or if they're a year and succeed?
[01:03:35.318 --> 01:03:37.739]  That's designed to fail.
[01:03:38.539 --> 01:03:39.319]  Designed to fail.
[01:03:39.639 --> 01:03:40.740]  Planned obsolescence.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.280]  Anything else?
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.220]  That's all.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:42.560]  Thank you.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.080]  God bless you.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.061]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:46.481]  Bunch of calls coming up after this break.
[01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:47.502]  Masses of news.
[01:03:47.902 --> 01:03:48.742]  And I'll talk about that
[01:03:53.399 --> 01:03:57.743]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.923 --> 01:04:02.268]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:04.787 --> 01:04:06.067]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:34.076]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.376 --> 01:04:39.738]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:04:40.258 --> 01:04:44.160]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:44.620]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.481]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:04:54.249 --> 01:04:58.753]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.093 --> 01:05:03.197]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.477 --> 01:05:04.038]  We listened.
[01:05:04.338 --> 01:05:09.322]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.603 --> 01:05:10.083]  We listened.
[01:05:10.463 --> 01:05:13.506]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.926 --> 01:05:14.447]  We listened.
[01:05:14.907 --> 01:05:18.968]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.849]  We listened.
[01:05:20.189 --> 01:05:25.411]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:25.851 --> 01:05:27.211]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.571 --> 01:05:34.934]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:35.334 --> 01:05:38.775]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:48.812]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:51.973]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.134 --> 01:05:55.715]  Government and theft which governs me.
[01:05:56.275 --> 01:05:57.596]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:58.036 --> 01:06:00.737]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.178 --> 01:06:03.819]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.259 --> 01:06:10.702]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:11.042 --> 01:06:18.850]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[01:06:31.563 --> 01:06:33.003]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:33.183 --> 01:06:33.523]  Have you?
[01:06:34.104 --> 01:06:35.604]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:06:36.064 --> 01:06:39.805]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:39.825 --> 01:06:43.825]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:44.265 --> 01:06:45.326]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:06:45.886 --> 01:06:47.066]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[01:06:47.506 --> 01:06:51.147]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:06:58.055 --> 01:06:58.695]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.356 --> 01:07:00.416]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.137 --> 01:07:02.297]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.898 --> 01:07:03.718]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:05.979]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.019 --> 01:07:09.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.201 --> 01:07:14.343]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.124 --> 01:07:23.548]  Oh, just an internet programming note, you can always find internet streams to listen to the radio show at infowars.com.
[01:07:23.588 --> 01:07:24.809]  We have our own backup.
[01:07:25.706 --> 01:07:26.948]  That is small.
[01:07:27.068 --> 01:07:28.751]  It's only at 500 streams right now.
[01:07:29.632 --> 01:07:31.134]  And people are starting to utilize those.
[01:07:31.175 --> 01:07:32.777]  But they're going to be up to 2,000.
[01:07:33.157 --> 01:07:34.279]  Nice little supplement.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.646]  2,000 continuous listeners by tomorrow evening.
[01:07:38.686 --> 01:07:39.928]  Maybe even by tonight.
[01:07:39.948 --> 01:07:41.270]  But I like to give us an extra day.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:52.470]  And so if you're having problems with the Genesis Network a couple times a day, having it hiccup or cut out on you, well, I'm just fitting the bill to offer 2,000 streams right now.
[01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:53.451]  500 are there.
[01:07:53.471 --> 01:07:58.076]  And what you get is, you get the Genesis stream, and if it goes down, it automatically reconnects you
[01:07:58.736 --> 01:07:59.117]  We're good to go.
[01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:26.177]  All the shows that are on the lineup that carries the stream that I'm on day and night.
[01:08:26.757 --> 01:08:28.878]  You can hear all those shows as well, not just my own shows.
[01:08:28.918 --> 01:08:30.698]  I'm going to fit the bill for them as well.
[01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:32.499]  I'm sure I'll be attacked for it.
[01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:33.519]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:08:35.019 --> 01:08:37.000]  Just having some fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.840]  But I want to thank the folks who helped us do that.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.761]  We're going to boost that up to 2,000.
[01:08:43.441 --> 01:08:46.362]  And then on another InfoWars server, we're going to add another 500.
[01:08:46.402 --> 01:08:47.082]  I forgot it.
[01:08:47.142 --> 01:08:48.262]  It's going to be 2,500 streams.
[01:08:51.492 --> 01:08:54.695]  Because we've had a problem where people just stop listening.
[01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:58.779]  They try over and over again to listen and can't get on.
[01:08:58.879 --> 01:09:02.382]  It's like they sell out of the Xboxes or something.
[01:09:02.402 --> 01:09:06.426]  It's so popular, we can't even give you what you want.
[01:09:07.107 --> 01:09:10.790]  And so I just want to tell people that I'm stepping up to the plate.
[01:09:11.503 --> 01:09:15.905]  After two weeks of this going on and taking action and dealing with it.
[01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:20.127]  So it's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:09:20.187 --> 01:09:22.288]  Please tell your whole email list about that link.
[01:09:22.809 --> 01:09:25.190]  It says here's the alternate backup.
[01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:27.442]  Because it says Stream 1 and Stream 2.
[01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:28.622]  Stream 1 and Backup.
[01:09:28.982 --> 01:09:30.083]  That's the network backup.
[01:09:30.403 --> 01:09:33.584]  Then we say, if these streams aren't working, use this stream.
[01:09:33.944 --> 01:09:35.705]  So, that's there for you.
[01:09:36.365 --> 01:09:39.626]  And actually, over the next few days, those links are actually going to change.
[01:09:39.986 --> 01:09:41.827]  So bookmark those when that happens.
[01:09:41.907 --> 01:09:42.087]  Okay.
[01:09:42.347 --> 01:09:43.348]  Program note out of the way.
[01:09:43.648 --> 01:09:47.529]  You know, the Internet's a small part of our audience compared to the AM and FM and shortwave.
[01:09:47.889 --> 01:09:49.190]  Well, I think it's bigger than shortwave now.
[01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:55.692]  It's still very important, and it gives us people in every town, every city, all over the world.
[01:09:56.152 --> 01:10:10.638]  We have listeners from Japan, to South Africa, from China, to the United Kingdom, to Venezuela, to Chile, to even weather stations in McMurtle, in Antarctica.
[01:10:10.678 --> 01:10:14.899]  So it's very, very important, and so we're adding more redundancy, more backup.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.861]  I'm even going to add a whole other backup server for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:36.711]  We've got it all ironed out and humming along like a well-oiled machine, but I'm just going to add a whole nother of the latest super-powerful servers as a backup system on top of that, all seamlessly interwoven so you can get that material you need.
[01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:38.691]  That's going to happen in the next few weeks.
[01:10:38.771 --> 01:10:39.131]  Okay!
[01:10:39.671 --> 01:10:40.972]  Those program notes are completed.
[01:10:40.992 --> 01:10:44.072]  The Internet's a big part of what we do.
[01:10:44.112 --> 01:10:45.152]  We have this new server.
[01:10:45.172 --> 01:10:46.653]  We'll have six servers.
[01:10:46.693 --> 01:10:48.733]  That's Alex Jones will have six servers.
[01:10:50.889 --> 01:11:03.300]  Genesis only has one, but I believe in redundancy, I believe in backups, I believe in more boots on the ground in the info war, in cyberspace, and we're doing that.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:12.067]  We're launching more flotillas basically, more troop ships to board the enemy vessels and take them.
[01:11:13.348 --> 01:11:21.633]  Okay, now we're getting off into the information warfare philosophy here, and I'm trying to draw parallels with past days with it.
[01:11:22.793 --> 01:11:26.615]  I think I'm succeeding in babbling, is what I have to say.
[01:11:26.635 --> 01:11:29.737]  I'm babbling, babbling very profusely.
[01:11:31.278 --> 01:11:32.138]  Drudge Report.
[01:11:32.939 --> 01:11:36.140]  CNN, the Situation Room, 4 p.m.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:36.901]  yesterday.
[01:11:38.385 --> 01:11:39.926]  Wolf Blitzer, host.
[01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:44.249]  Don King is known worldwide as a big-time boxing promoter.
[01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.630]  Really?
[01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:49.553]  But has also taken some new fights on recently.
[01:11:49.974 --> 01:11:51.255]  You love George Bush.
[01:11:52.316 --> 01:11:55.298]  I love George Bush because I think he's a revolutionary.
[01:11:56.279 --> 01:12:00.602]  Can't really do Don King, but... The president that comes in with the conclusiveness.
[01:12:02.347 --> 01:12:07.550]  What they're doing in tomorrow in Iraq is a demonstration of that for the vote for democracy.
[01:12:07.831 --> 01:12:14.915]  The fundamental process of democracy is freedom of speech, law and order, being able to give freedom, working with people and working with governing.
[01:12:15.135 --> 01:12:16.596]  Yourself, George Bush, is that.
[01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.337]  He included in.
[01:12:19.138 --> 01:12:19.518]  Blitzer.
[01:12:20.855 --> 01:12:23.959]  Uh, do you have any regrets supporting him?
[01:12:24.319 --> 01:12:28.885]  Take a look at the picture with you where I were there at the dinner last year.
[01:12:28.905 --> 01:12:32.950]  Do you have any regrets supporting him and enthusiastically as you did?
[01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.853]  King, no I don't in fact.
[01:12:36.294 --> 01:12:40.519]  I want to support him more now because it seems like everybody is punching him.
[01:12:41.443 --> 01:12:42.323]  You know what I mean.
[01:12:42.683 --> 01:12:43.864]  But he's fighting back.
[01:12:44.304 --> 01:12:45.084]  I can't do it anymore.
[01:12:45.504 --> 01:12:52.166]  And he's throwing great combinations, and I think he's the guy that is really a revolutionary president.
[01:12:52.926 --> 01:12:54.927]  And King knows exactly what he's saying when he says that.
[01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:56.968]  We're taking these suckers is great.
[01:12:58.188 --> 01:13:08.731]  I think he's a president that cares about the people he represents, but doesn't compromise himself to the extent that he acquiesces and accommodates.
[01:13:09.364 --> 01:13:18.533]  He goes out there and says like it is, and tries to make things better, inclusiveness, education, he's fighting for that.
[01:13:18.673 --> 01:13:33.327]  And then it goes on, these are the things that many, many guys that don't fight for, George Walker Bush is a tremendous advocate to America, a great president for the great American people, and he's decisive, he doesn't equivocate.
[01:13:35.649 --> 01:13:37.631]  Sorry about starting a Don King accent.
[01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:38.952]  I haven't heard him in so long.
[01:13:38.972 --> 01:13:41.414]  I don't know what he talks like, but it's real obnoxious and fast.
[01:13:41.734 --> 01:13:46.338]  Kind of like myself, but with a Georgia accent with some Yankee mixed in.
[01:13:46.358 --> 01:13:51.702]  But the point is that Don King is a convicted murderer.
[01:13:52.623 --> 01:13:57.427]  Don King beat somebody to death that didn't pay him back a debt for gambling.
[01:13:57.787 --> 01:14:00.369]  He was a loan shark enforcer for the Mafia.
[01:14:02.231 --> 01:14:05.073]  And then he became, I guess, a made man in his own right.
[01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:13.674]  And I think the evidence is Don King is a front for some even larger interest, and they have a monopoly over most of the fights in this country.
[01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.296]  And he's ruined boxing, by the way.
[01:14:16.638 --> 01:14:18.239]  They won't let any real fighters come up.
[01:14:18.299 --> 01:14:19.601]  It's totally controlled.
[01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:22.504]  The purses are so big that you might get one fight a year.
[01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.965]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:14:24.025 --> 01:14:25.507]  He's ruined heavyweight boxing.
[01:14:25.547 --> 01:14:26.268]  Let me be specific.
[01:14:27.992 --> 01:14:37.636]  Which I tended to like growing up a little bit, but think of the old days when our parents were kids and our grandparents were watching the fights.
[01:14:38.277 --> 01:14:49.121]  My mother talked about growing up with her dad at home, but not after being a leasehound and before that a roughneck in the oil fields, but drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and watching the fights on the black and white TV.
[01:14:49.722 --> 01:14:51.802]  You don't see that anymore because of corruption.
[01:14:51.842 --> 01:14:53.383]  Corruption burns everything down.
[01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:55.404]  Corruption minimizes your choices.
[01:14:55.904 --> 01:14:57.545]  And you've got this creature
[01:14:58.274 --> 01:15:14.663]  Don King, this enforcer, this racketeer, this oily creature, and over the years I've read about it, I've seen it, I don't even follow boxing that much, of how he and Bush Sr.
[01:15:14.703 --> 01:15:18.966]  just love each other and hang out and go to dinner and they're just such big buddies.
[01:15:18.986 --> 01:15:20.086]  Because Bush Sr.
[01:15:20.126 --> 01:15:20.667]  likes that.
[01:15:20.867 --> 01:15:21.787]  He likes crooks.
[01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:23.588]  He's a CIA hitman himself.
[01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:26.370]  They like men who burn their bones.
[01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:33.584]  I mean, I guess Don King could say to Bush Sr., I earned my bones when you were dating cheerleaders, boy!
[01:15:33.604 --> 01:15:35.865]  Ha ha!
[01:15:35.885 --> 01:15:38.046]  That's what I like about it!
[01:15:38.386 --> 01:15:40.827]  I mean, it's just a sick joke!
[01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:47.451]  This is who runs our country's criminals, mobsters, gangsters, and I've got to hear from some murderer?
[01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:49.352]  Some murderer?
[01:15:49.372 --> 01:15:51.893]  I've got to hear from some mafia twit?
[01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:57.523]  He made his money shoving people around and squeezing people and going into businesses and shaking people down?
[01:15:57.543 --> 01:15:58.784]  Let me tell you something.
[01:15:58.964 --> 01:16:02.525]  A big, fat Don King walked through my office door and tried to shake me down.
[01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:03.846]  He wouldn't like what happened!
[01:16:04.886 --> 01:16:07.587]  That's why they operated in places where people put up with it!
[01:16:08.207 --> 01:16:13.089]  And I see my fellow Texans turning into jellyfish, and now I see stuff like that going on around here!
[01:16:13.109 --> 01:16:17.491]  I mean, I'm just sick of it!
[01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:22.414]  And it just shows you how criminal they are!
[01:16:22.794 --> 01:16:39.413]  Negroponte, all these guys, top torture masters, involved in all sorts of crimes, and money laundering, and drug dealing, and it's just all admitted, and they're just up there laughing at us, a bunch of gangsters, snickering and laughing, with big fancy advertisement PR firms, telling you how great they are!
[01:16:40.886 --> 01:16:45.307]  And Hillary having big dinners with Murdoch and the Bushes, and Clinton having meetings with them.
[01:16:45.347 --> 01:16:48.068]  It's all just snickering and laughing at us.
[01:16:48.448 --> 01:16:52.569]  Clinton and Don King, just our buddies, all of them laughing at us.
[01:16:52.889 --> 01:16:54.610]  Ha ha, they're a bunch of stupid idiots!
[01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:55.990]  Look at, I love America!
[01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:57.531]  Look at how we sucked all these idiots!
[01:16:57.671 --> 01:16:59.771]  That's why, that's why I said I love America!
[01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:01.632]  George Bush loves America too!
[01:17:04.012 --> 01:17:09.774]  Where else can cokeheads and murderers and criminals and racketeers and drug dealers run you, run everything?
[01:17:10.362 --> 01:17:13.485]  With an ignorant, gullible, thumb-sucking population.
[01:17:14.385 --> 01:17:16.127]  Alright, I'm just really getting angry.
[01:17:16.427 --> 01:17:16.868]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.589]  Don.
[01:17:18.929 --> 01:17:20.731]  And Don King's this pop icon.
[01:17:20.971 --> 01:17:22.332]  Oh, isn't he cute?
[01:17:22.592 --> 01:17:25.615]  With the little white hair sticking up on top of his head.
[01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:28.798]  Isn't he sweet?
[01:17:30.899 --> 01:17:31.660]  Who's up first?
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.821]  Who's up first in line here?
[01:17:37.443 --> 01:17:37.883]  You know what?
[01:17:37.923 --> 01:17:39.304]  We'll just go to him after the break.
[01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:43.586]  I'm not going to go to him right now and then not give him time and then have to hold him over.
[01:17:43.606 --> 01:17:46.827]  We'll take a bunch of your calls when we get back.
[01:17:46.847 --> 01:17:47.367]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:17:47.387 --> 01:17:49.808]  Patrick Richard and many others.
[01:17:49.848 --> 01:17:50.709]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:17:50.729 --> 01:17:52.890]  I mean, we should be angry.
[01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:55.991]  We've got criminals stomping all over us.
[01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:59.332]  Hiking their leg on us, treating us like trash.
[01:17:59.352 --> 01:18:03.635]  They've militarized the police, got them acting like mafia enforcer goons themselves.
[01:18:04.095 --> 01:18:05.916]  They're building giant FEMA camps everywhere.
[01:18:06.517 --> 01:18:08.198]  Setting up national ID cards.
[01:18:08.238 --> 01:18:12.621]  They've got goon teams marching around demanding to see our IDs, federal, state, and local.
[01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:15.723]  Cameras going up everywhere, run by absolute criminals!
[01:18:15.743 --> 01:18:21.387]  It's like DynCorp, what now, CSC, downtown.
[01:18:22.107 --> 01:18:26.330]  Moved in there with, uh, Computer Science Corporation.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.901]  They run all the city's data collection information.
[01:18:29.941 --> 01:18:31.622]  I was just talking to my friend about that yesterday.
[01:18:32.222 --> 01:18:33.163]  Formerly DynCorp.
[01:18:35.004 --> 01:18:36.384]  All the things DynCorp's done.
[01:18:36.404 --> 01:18:39.546]  I mean, it makes the worst horror movie look tame.
[01:18:40.606 --> 01:18:44.008]  Just, just, just... But now they're just here.
[01:18:44.088 --> 01:18:44.908]  I just run things.
[01:18:45.249 --> 01:18:45.649]  Ah, you know.
[01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:46.909]  That's how it is.
[01:18:46.929 --> 01:18:49.511]  You know, let me tell you something.
[01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:52.072]  Crime does pay if it's at the highest levels.
[01:18:53.484 --> 01:19:02.130]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:06.773]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:19:07.574 --> 01:19:11.516]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:19:11.877 --> 01:19:16.900]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.103]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,
[01:19:21.363 --> 01:19:22.004]  We're good to go!

[01:20:54.525 --> 01:20:56.766]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:01.549]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:01.829 --> 01:21:07.632]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:07.852 --> 01:21:11.914]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:12.194 --> 01:21:17.838]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:20.579]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.202]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:26.302 --> 01:21:29.003]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:29.323 --> 01:21:31.624]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:32.025 --> 01:21:35.626]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:36.127 --> 01:21:42.310]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:43.750]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.411]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.431 --> 01:21:44.611]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.119 --> 01:21:55.740]  E equals MC squared is wrong.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.041]  What are you talking about?
[01:21:57.321 --> 01:21:58.802]  Einstein's equations have errors.
[01:21:58.922 --> 01:22:01.603]  It's in this book I've been reading, The Collapse of Special Relativity.
[01:22:01.723 --> 01:22:02.844]  That can't be right.
[01:22:03.004 --> 01:22:03.865]  Where did you hear about that?
[01:22:04.105 --> 01:22:07.426]  In Requiem for Relativity, The Collapse of Special Relativity.
[01:22:07.747 --> 01:22:11.189]  A book at RelativityCollapse.net and RelativityCollapse.com.
[01:22:11.389 --> 01:22:13.830]  I liked what they had to say so I bought it at Amazon.com.
[01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:15.171]  I don't know.
[01:22:15.251 --> 01:22:16.972]  It sounds like it'd be complicated to read.
[01:22:17.272 --> 01:22:18.112]  That's where you're wrong.
[01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:18.973]  It's written with a
[01:22:20.879 --> 01:22:21.079]  I think so.
[01:22:31.878 --> 01:22:39.842]  Requiem for Relativity, The Collapse of Special Relativity at RelativityCollapse.com, RelativityCollapse.net or Amazon.com.
[01:22:40.102 --> 01:22:41.723]  I still can't believe that Einstein is wrong.
[01:22:42.043 --> 01:22:43.263]  It's the 21st century.
[01:22:43.323 --> 01:22:44.024]  Get up to speed.
[01:22:44.444 --> 01:22:51.407]  Just buy The Collapse of Special Relativity at RelativityCollapse.com or RelativityCollapse.net or Amazon.com today.
[01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:59.899]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:02.899]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:02.919 --> 01:23:10.801]  You know, I ignore threats to my person most of the time.
[01:23:11.341 --> 01:23:19.043]  But I've been ignoring it so bad that I didn't even really pay attention to a pretty high level
[01:23:20.018 --> 01:23:32.463]  military intelligence officer I've known for years who warned me about something about three months ago and now the pieces came together and I'm not going to reveal a lot more than that, but we'll just wait until the next segment.
[01:23:32.503 --> 01:23:37.965]  I'm going to spend a minute or two on it because I don't talk about this stuff for nothing, folks.
[01:23:38.005 --> 01:23:38.685]  This is serious.
[01:23:39.245 --> 01:23:47.528]  These are very serious people and I'm going to, so I'll mention it because that tends to put them out in the lights, the hot lights, which they don't like.
[01:23:48.211 --> 01:23:50.553]  They like to creep around like cockroaches when it's in the dark.
[01:23:51.253 --> 01:23:54.075]  About to go to Terry, but he just hung up, so let's go to Richard.
[01:23:54.976 --> 01:23:57.017]  And Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[01:23:58.899 --> 01:23:59.199]  Omaha.
[01:23:59.559 --> 01:24:00.180]  Welcome, sir.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:00.620]  Go ahead.
[01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:10.067]  I just heard some earlier caller mention about they want to know about the gold and silver reserve in the Twin Towers.
[01:24:10.785 --> 01:24:13.286]  That was my point of it, exactly.
[01:24:33.557 --> 01:24:38.080]  Uh, about that as well, and I'm sorry if that got past me on that aspect of it.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:38.941]  No, that's okay, sir.
[01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:39.461]  What's your point?
[01:24:39.481 --> 01:24:39.801]  Go ahead.
[01:24:40.182 --> 01:24:48.267]  Oh, well, uh, that is, uh, that, that was my point that, uh, you know, the first 24 hours they made a big deal of it on all the news and everything.
[01:24:48.287 --> 01:24:49.628]  Then all of a sudden it just dropped.
[01:24:50.329 --> 01:24:52.450]  Like, uh, like every, uh, like everything.
[01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:59.695]  And, oh, one thing about the Mayor Giuliani, it was more important that he find the gold and silver and everything.
[01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:09.667]  More than that, after that, then all of a sudden you wanted everybody, you saw him wanting to have everybody search high and low.
[01:25:09.767 --> 01:25:15.450]  First we heard there was $170-something billion, then they tried to reduce it to $100 billion, then we heard it was over $200 billion.
[01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:23.535]  We don't know the exact number, but there were two huge vaults in there, Federal Reserve vaults, and they're just gone, and gold doesn't disappear.
[01:25:24.756 --> 01:25:26.257]  If it melts, it coalesces, right?
[01:25:26.277 --> 01:25:32.363]  But if they just, quote, ship the wreckage to China, and no accounting... See, I mean, think about this.
[01:25:32.423 --> 01:25:34.766]  No accounting, no forensics, no research.
[01:25:34.826 --> 01:25:36.287]  Just believe our official story.
[01:25:36.668 --> 01:25:37.088]  Shut up.
[01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:46.418]  Boy, that... I mean, the FBI... I mean, talk about an FBI... I mean, the FBI would be having a conniption, if something like that.
[01:25:47.083 --> 01:26:01.947]  Well, they're told to shut up, and so it'd be like if, say, Fort Knox got blown up, let's say, or a big earthquake happened and Fort Knox collapsed into a crater, and then they just said, oh, we're not going to talk about the gold that was there.
[01:26:02.027 --> 01:26:06.648]  It's in the crater, but we'll just never discuss it, and it's going to disappear now, and don't you bring it up.
[01:26:06.688 --> 01:26:07.568]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:08.849]  Good to hear from you, Richard.
[01:26:08.869 --> 01:26:09.609]  Thank you for calling.
[01:26:10.309 --> 01:26:12.310]  Let's talk to Larry in California.
[01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:12.830]  You're on the air.
[01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:13.210]  Go ahead.
[01:26:14.144 --> 01:26:16.865]  Hey Alex, this is Larry in Huntington Beach, California.
[01:26:16.965 --> 01:26:17.965]  Yes sir, welcome!
[01:26:18.786 --> 01:26:24.007]  Um, I have some interesting information you might, you and your guests might be interested in.
[01:26:24.027 --> 01:26:42.554]  Um, I have been interviewing a guy who has done intelligence work for many multinational groups, and just to get the cut to the chase, what he's been explaining to me is that it doesn't matter when we pull out of Iraq,
[01:26:43.635 --> 01:27:07.282]  It has been in the workings for about three decades to use the Iraqi war as a covert operation to bring about the rise of a Shiite empire between Iraq and Iran and to allow the Shiite empire to then go to war, civil war, with the Sunni Muslims, and so on and so forth.
[01:27:08.163 --> 01:27:12.784]  But that we're not really there trying to bring about democracy, rather
[01:27:13.393 --> 01:27:18.077]  We're part of a secret move to bring about a Shiite Muslim empire.
[01:27:18.237 --> 01:27:24.421]  Well, we always knew they wanted to create Balkanization and get everybody fighting with each other and have it be civil war.
[01:27:24.481 --> 01:27:27.924]  I mean, we have declassified documents from 83 where that was the plan for Iraq.
[01:27:28.304 --> 01:27:29.485]  We have public statements in 2000.
[01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:30.966]  We have PNAC documents.
[01:27:31.367 --> 01:27:35.710]  And now I was listening to NPR a few weeks ago and like show after show, I was listening for hours,
[01:27:36.514 --> 01:27:37.334]  Right, that's part of the
[01:28:01.055 --> 01:28:07.300]  They want to use the Shiite milit... the Shiite to basically go in there and try to centralize the... Hey, guess who just walked in here?
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:08.380]  This is Dean Hagelin.
[01:28:08.961 --> 01:28:09.842]  Hey, buddy, how you doing?
[01:28:10.382 --> 01:28:11.803]  Well, listen, send me some info on that.
[01:28:11.823 --> 01:28:12.423]  Do you have a website?
[01:28:12.443 --> 01:28:13.624]  Are you posting these interviews?
[01:28:14.125 --> 01:28:15.546]  I'm... I would like to mail them to you.
[01:28:15.626 --> 01:28:19.229]  Do you have a good address?
[01:28:19.249 --> 01:28:20.850]  Yes, uh, it's 3001... Uh-huh.
[01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.272]  ...in South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R... Uh-huh.
[01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.093]  ...Suite 100... Uh-huh.
[01:28:26.254 --> 01:28:27.875]  ...Austin, Texas... Uh-huh.
[01:28:27.895 --> 01:28:27.875]  ...78704.
[01:28:27.915 --> 01:28:28.816]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:28:31.198 --> 01:28:31.919]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:32.640]  Good hearing from you.
[01:28:33.301 --> 01:28:34.762]  And we've got some more news coming up.
[01:28:34.782 --> 01:28:35.403]  Some more of your calls.
[01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.626]  And then coming up, Dean Haglund in studio.
[01:28:39.008 --> 01:28:39.588]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.954 --> 01:28:44.855]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.335 --> 01:28:46.937]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.858 --> 01:28:50.542]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.923 --> 01:28:56.284]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.525 --> 01:29:00.367]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.687 --> 01:29:01.508]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.928 --> 01:29:06.070]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:10.473]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:15.716]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:16.096 --> 01:29:19.678]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.858 --> 01:29:25.221]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.481 --> 01:29:28.222]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.503 --> 01:29:29.403]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:30:14.862 --> 01:30:18.785]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.

[01:30:53.442 --> 01:30:55.904]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:56.664 --> 01:31:02.288]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:31:02.329 --> 01:31:03.089]  Supreme Court.
[01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:08.153]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[01:31:08.193 --> 01:31:11.815]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:31:12.796 --> 01:31:18.020]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:31:18.826 --> 01:31:27.134]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:31:28.696 --> 01:31:30.457]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:30.477 --> 01:31:30.858]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:42.748 --> 01:31:43.329]  Call now.
[01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:50.042]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:31:57.592 --> 01:32:11.059]  Okay, we've got Debbie Morrow joining us for about four minutes, and then I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:32:11.119 --> 01:32:13.640]  And coming up in the next hour, he's in here right now setting up his camera.
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.522]  He's making a documentary himself, so we'll have dueling cameras.
[01:32:16.542 --> 01:32:18.283]  I've got my own video cameras.
[01:32:18.723 --> 01:32:20.864]  Star for nine seasons on the X-Files, and of course,
[01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:29.110]  We've got a link up on InfoWars.com to Dean Haglin's website.
[01:32:29.891 --> 01:32:34.834]  Now listen, I don't say this to try to get attention.
[01:32:34.935 --> 01:32:36.516]  I actually don't like talking about it.
[01:32:36.936 --> 01:32:39.198]  I don't even like consciously thinking about it myself.
[01:32:39.838 --> 01:32:41.379]  But this is a dangerous business we're in.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:48.025]  Remember about six months ago we played Cynthia McKinney grilling Rumsfeld and she brought up how Norad stood down on 9-11.
[01:32:48.085 --> 01:32:49.205]  She brought up the war games.
[01:32:50.336 --> 01:32:51.077]  A bunch of issues.
[01:32:51.097 --> 01:32:58.505]  She also brought up DynCorp, which was bought by Computer Science Corporation, whose base, their main base is here in Austin.
[01:32:58.766 --> 01:32:59.947]  They moved here a couple of years ago.
[01:33:00.868 --> 01:33:02.049]  And basically took over the city.
[01:33:02.089 --> 01:33:02.850]  It's very spooky.
[01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:04.652]  Took over city programming.
[01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:07.846]  We're good to go.
[01:33:30.598 --> 01:33:41.744]  I played that clip about DynCorp, and I got on my local TV show here in Austin, it's very popular, and I played the clip, and I talked about how DynCorp had been bought out by CSC, and I said, I don't know if CSC's bad.
[01:33:41.764 --> 01:33:50.648]  I know Computer Science Corporation's into data and databases and things like that, a lot of Big Brother type stuff, but I said, I haven't really researched them, I don't know, I just know they're big.
[01:33:51.904 --> 01:33:52.885]  And we've got the clip.
[01:33:52.925 --> 01:33:53.725]  It's eight minutes long.
[01:33:53.765 --> 01:33:57.828]  What I'll do is probably isolate the small clip about DynCorp and kidnapping kids.
[01:33:58.148 --> 01:34:01.630]  And the Rumsfeld doesn't deny it, because it has been in BBC, AP, Reuters.
[01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:05.952]  They kidnapped 200,000 women and children with the United Nations.
[01:34:05.972 --> 01:34:06.273]  You think 200,000.
[01:34:06.313 --> 01:34:09.134]  That's two giant football stadiums gone.
[01:34:10.175 --> 01:34:12.836]  And some were used as, you know, slave labor maids.
[01:34:12.956 --> 01:34:14.097]  Others as sex slaves.
[01:34:14.597 --> 01:34:15.438]  And that's public.
[01:34:16.275 --> 01:34:23.358]  And for years I get on local Austin TV, even before Sidney McKinney talked about it, and I said, you know, DynCorp is able to do this and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:34:23.678 --> 01:34:26.239]  And then Rumsfeld said, well, we put them in the penalty box.
[01:34:26.279 --> 01:34:28.099]  We didn't give them contracts for a year.
[01:34:28.119 --> 01:34:29.800]  You know, that's their punishment.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.961]  And see, this sounds Orwellian.
[01:34:31.981 --> 01:34:33.261]  This sounds like the X-Files.
[01:34:33.981 --> 01:34:35.342]  This sounds like the Outer Limits.
[01:34:36.742 --> 01:34:38.623]  It sounds like all of that, but it's not.
[01:34:38.663 --> 01:34:39.603]  This is America.
[01:34:40.264 --> 01:34:42.004]  This is the real world.
[01:34:42.444 --> 01:34:43.745]  This is really happening.
[01:34:44.722 --> 01:34:52.594]  I have a friend, high-level military intelligence, and I have another associate who's retired high-level army intelligence.
[01:34:53.536 --> 01:34:58.543]  And first the army intelligence fellow calls me, and he's nothing but a good source, and he says,
[01:34:59.989 --> 01:35:01.851]  Do you know what Computer Science Corporation is?
[01:35:02.231 --> 01:35:04.553]  And of course, I get so busy, I didn't put two and two together.
[01:35:04.653 --> 01:35:05.994]  I knew they'd bought DynCorp.
[01:35:06.374 --> 01:35:09.377]  I knew that they had three big city buildings downtown.
[01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:11.779]  I knew that they ran all the city's data.
[01:35:11.819 --> 01:35:13.320]  I knew that their main home base was here.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.063]  Now, and I said, yeah, I know about Computer Science Corporation.
[01:35:17.083 --> 01:35:19.225]  He said, well, we've got somebody inside there.
[01:35:20.185 --> 01:35:25.069]  And they overheard some pretty serious characters saying that they're going to, quote, take you down.
[01:35:25.150 --> 01:35:26.831]  It's time to take you down, take you out.
[01:35:27.947 --> 01:35:29.468]  And I said, well, I don't know what that means.
[01:35:29.508 --> 01:35:30.528]  Why would a computer come?
[01:35:30.548 --> 01:35:31.809]  And I was like blind to it.
[01:35:31.829 --> 01:35:36.371]  It's like I almost went into self-amnesia because normally I make all these connections and know all these points.
[01:35:37.532 --> 01:35:40.413]  I'd forgotten that I'd talked about how that's now dying core.
[01:35:41.413 --> 01:35:41.773]  Okay?
[01:35:41.793 --> 01:35:43.694]  And he just said, you better take this serious.
[01:35:43.714 --> 01:35:45.895]  He's never told me stuff personally about myself.
[01:35:46.216 --> 01:35:51.418]  Then I get another call, never mentioned it on air, another call from another source saying the same thing.
[01:35:53.383 --> 01:35:57.766]  And I was out a few weeks ago when the Watson Brothers were here from England, canoeing.
[01:35:58.447 --> 01:36:03.770]  And I was looking at the CSC buildings off the river, and I was saying, CSC, CSC, Computer Science Corporation.
[01:36:04.591 --> 01:36:05.051]  What is it?
[01:36:05.631 --> 01:36:10.935]  Why would they have people inside one of their compartmentalized units saying, I've got to be taken down.
[01:36:11.855 --> 01:36:12.336]  Taken out.
[01:36:12.436 --> 01:36:13.316]  Both those things were said.
[01:36:14.437 --> 01:36:17.920]  And then, I said, there's something missing.
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.781]  There's something I'm not going to worry about it.
[01:36:20.321 --> 01:36:22.923]  And then I just realized, that's DynCorp.
[01:36:23.743 --> 01:36:24.743]  That's DynCorp!
[01:36:25.543 --> 01:36:42.168]  And so that's actually scary, when the biggest mercenary company in the world... I mean, we're talking serious people who got caught with the UN kidnapping women and children on an industrial scale, thousands of flights, brimming with women and children, out of the Balkans.
[01:36:44.278 --> 01:36:45.259]  That actually scares me.
[01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:45.999]  I'll tell you how it scares me.
[01:36:46.019 --> 01:36:47.059]  Because I want to continue my work.
[01:36:47.159 --> 01:36:48.000]  I'm not afraid of dying.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.781]  I am afraid of not finishing my work.
[01:36:50.261 --> 01:36:53.482]  And see, I've almost got blinders on to ignore threats.
[01:36:53.522 --> 01:36:55.063]  You know, I really do.
[01:36:55.783 --> 01:36:59.325]  And I hadn't consciously thought about what a threat this is.
[01:37:00.328 --> 01:37:05.651]  And, you know, I've got sources, I've got two different sources on the same intel inside your company.
[01:37:05.911 --> 01:37:08.413]  I'm not saying all of computer science corporations are doing this.
[01:37:08.833 --> 01:37:16.318]  I'm not saying, I mean clearly I've got to learn more now and find out specifics which people were reluctant to give me about what group it is inside there.
[01:37:17.338 --> 01:37:19.539]  My sources said we can't tell you much more than that.
[01:37:19.559 --> 01:37:22.040]  I don't know if this is a message inadvertently through them.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.321]  They want me to hear about this.
[01:37:23.561 --> 01:37:24.921]  But I'm pretty popular in this town.
[01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:27.802]  And I got an idea that, you know, we've got fans inside there.
[01:37:28.062 --> 01:37:29.723]  Just don't shoot your mouths off, okay?
[01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:33.244]  Because if something happens to me, I demand the full autopsy.
[01:37:34.065 --> 01:37:39.547]  I demand they look for derivatives in my blood that show that certain poisons have been metabolized.
[01:37:39.827 --> 01:37:45.269]  Because they can cover up the poison, but not the metabolizing enzymes that show that that's been metabolized.
[01:37:45.689 --> 01:37:52.835]  If I get killed in a car wreck or some lunatic out of the insane asylum gets out and shoots me, or anything happens to me, you know where to look.
[01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:56.258]  And it's right down there off the river, right beside Congress.
[01:37:56.839 --> 01:37:58.920]  It's right there, the big CSC building.
[01:38:00.742 --> 01:38:01.843]  And I don't appreciate it.
[01:38:02.403 --> 01:38:04.545]  And I don't appreciate people shooting their mouths off.
[01:38:04.765 --> 01:38:06.387]  Let me tell the employees of something over there.
[01:38:07.592 --> 01:38:08.432]  Do you want it?
[01:38:08.832 --> 01:38:10.313]  Do you want it on your hands?
[01:38:10.773 --> 01:38:11.413]  Do you want it?
[01:38:12.293 --> 01:38:15.634]  I mean, I would imagine most of you weren't involved in what DynCorp did with the U.N.
[01:38:15.694 --> 01:38:16.014]  over there.
[01:38:16.234 --> 01:38:18.614]  Look, I'm not the bad guy standing up for those women and children.
[01:38:18.854 --> 01:38:26.796]  And don't try to poo-poo it, don't try to make excuses, don't try to rationalize it, don't try to make excuses, don't try to say you weren't involved, don't try to say I'm exaggerating.
[01:38:27.256 --> 01:38:28.536]  There is no exaggeration.
[01:38:29.656 --> 01:38:32.997]  I got congressional hearings where Rumsfeld doesn't even deny it.
[01:38:33.627 --> 01:38:35.388]  And I'm sorry I'm for those little kids.
[01:38:35.648 --> 01:38:36.128]  And you know what?
[01:38:36.168 --> 01:38:38.629]  If I've got to die for those little kids, so be it.
[01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:39.829]  It's a good price to pay.
[01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:41.930]  Somebody's got to stand up for these people.
[01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:44.491]  Somebody's got to stand up against you bullies.
[01:38:44.912 --> 01:38:46.032]  Somebody's got to do it.
[01:38:47.202 --> 01:38:48.403]  And I think God's going to bless me.
[01:38:48.443 --> 01:38:50.204]  I think God's going to protect me, if that's His will.
[01:38:50.364 --> 01:38:51.384]  But I'm not afraid of you.
[01:38:51.564 --> 01:38:53.505]  I'm only afraid of not being able to finish my work.
[01:38:53.725 --> 01:39:00.049]  And I ask God to put a hedge of protection around me and my loved ones, the people that work for me, so that we can continue our work.
[01:39:00.069 --> 01:39:01.730]  And I know that hedge has been there.
[01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:03.871]  And I know there are a lot of good people in those companies.
[01:39:05.291 --> 01:39:08.393]  And I'm not intimidated by you, and I'm not afraid of you.
[01:39:10.174 --> 01:39:11.014]  You understand me?
[01:39:12.455 --> 01:39:13.396]  The gauntlet's down.
[01:39:13.456 --> 01:39:14.936]  I've already gone to the point of no return.
[01:39:15.156 --> 01:39:16.037]  You don't scare me.
[01:39:19.395 --> 01:39:40.753]  The last time I began to talk about this, we just so happened to have Colonel Craig Roberts on, who, let's just say, close to helping me see clearly on these issues, and right when I said that they will, they talked about how they want to take me down, we were thinking it was technical, boom, right then, which it had never happened in like a year.
[01:39:41.233 --> 01:39:45.437]  Right as I said that, and it's been happening intermittently since then, even in different studios, different lines,
[01:39:46.158 --> 01:39:46.878]  I've been ranting.
[01:39:46.938 --> 01:39:49.619]  I've got a bunch of news and your calls and everything.
[01:39:49.959 --> 01:39:53.900]  Debbie Morrow, I'm sorry you had to sit there and listen to that and sit through that.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:55.361]  I've just got to protect myself.
[01:39:55.841 --> 01:39:57.121]  I don't blame you.
[01:39:57.401 --> 01:40:00.602]  I'm glad to hear you talk like that.
[01:40:00.622 --> 01:40:04.803]  Because I agree with you 100%.
[01:40:06.644 --> 01:40:09.144]  Too many people are getting away with horrendous acts.
[01:40:09.344 --> 01:40:11.365]  And I agree with you completely.
[01:40:11.385 --> 01:40:15.286]  And the more you talk like that, the more safe you'll be.
[01:40:17.917 --> 01:40:36.213]  Well, I mean, I don't like doing it, but when I get it from two different sources, and you know, again, my mind automatically saw it as, oh, they mean the show, you know, they're technical experts, and I forgot, they bought the biggest Merck group in the world, who just has done, who is engaged in crimes so monumental, it dwarfs all imagining.
[01:40:36.473 --> 01:40:38.895]  I mean, imagine a horror movie where there's a U.S.
[01:40:38.915 --> 01:40:40.536]  corporation that kidnaps 200,000 women and children.
[01:40:42.978 --> 01:40:44.559]  I mean, you'd think that movie was ridiculous.
[01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:48.380]  Here they are, operating out in the open, and they don't like me talking about them.
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:50.401]  Well, they can go to... You know what?
[01:40:50.501 --> 01:40:52.462]  I know where they're going, and I'm just not afraid of them.
[01:40:54.763 --> 01:40:58.045]  Well, I'm very, very proud of you.
[01:40:58.365 --> 01:40:59.605]  No, it's not you.
[01:40:59.625 --> 01:41:00.666]  We shouldn't be proud of me.
[01:41:01.086 --> 01:41:04.187]  Look, I mean, we've gotten this position because we've put up with people like this.
[01:41:04.347 --> 01:41:04.968]  That's right.
[01:41:05.188 --> 01:41:09.450]  I mean, how else am I supposed to respond to psychopathic scum?
[01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:10.190]  Right.
[01:41:13.092 --> 01:41:17.162]  You know, that's what tyranny and dictatorship is, is when you get psychopathic scum running things.
[01:41:18.903 --> 01:41:19.723]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:41:19.763 --> 01:41:20.504]  Debbie, tell us.
[01:41:20.524 --> 01:41:21.684]  You've got a bunch of different specials.
[01:41:21.724 --> 01:41:22.944]  Holidays are coming up.
[01:41:22.964 --> 01:41:28.546]  You ship these out to UPS and people get them within just three or four days and they're just great systems.
[01:41:28.806 --> 01:41:31.807]  You've got little sports bottles that do 600 and something refills.
[01:41:31.827 --> 01:41:35.068]  You've got big, fancy, beautiful water filters that cut everything out.
[01:41:35.128 --> 01:41:37.209]  You've got sheltering in place DVDs.
[01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:40.450]  You've got potassium iodate in case there's a radiological event.
[01:41:40.530 --> 01:41:41.750]  It's all made in America.
[01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:42.671]  Just tell us all about it.
[01:41:42.851 --> 01:41:46.472]  The main thing I can just say, Alex, is tell your people to please call in.
[01:41:46.912 --> 01:41:56.437]  We'll support your air time by the sales that are coming in, as well as provide good healthy drinking water for your listeners.
[01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:13.807]  Rather than go out and buy Christmas presents that people will just throw in the closet, get your Berkey water filters, your Berkey sport bottles, your KDF shower filters and potassium iodate and have it be products that you can use every day.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.140]  And not have to wait for an emergency.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:40.345]  So I just want to tell your listeners to either go to our website, look at our products at www.berkeywater.com and it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com and put in the comments that you saw it in Alex Jones and we'll throw in the free Berkey Sport Bottles or different items that you can get with your order.
[01:42:41.431 --> 01:42:48.037]  Or if you want to call me, call toll free at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:42:48.497 --> 01:42:48.997]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:42:49.017 --> 01:42:55.943]  And like I said, we'll be helping support your airtime.
[01:42:56.043 --> 01:42:57.825]  So please give us a call.
[01:42:57.865 --> 01:43:01.808]  If you get the machine, leave your number twice and I will call you back.
[01:43:02.308 --> 01:43:06.532]  If you are in a real big hurry, then keep calling me because I am here.
[01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:10.538]  And I do call into the evening to leave a day and a night number.
[01:43:18.232 --> 01:43:21.113]  Is of course these murky water filters.
[01:43:21.133 --> 01:43:22.013]  They're made in America.
[01:43:22.533 --> 01:43:27.215]  They're on average, let's say, a $300 Chinese knockoff is a piece of junk and yours are $199.
[01:43:27.315 --> 01:43:34.217]  Or with all the bells and whistles, $259 with two free gifts, one free gift with a $199 model.
[01:43:34.637 --> 01:43:37.058]  You got generic bottles for $25 a piece.
[01:43:37.118 --> 01:43:39.579]  If you get five of them, they're $20 a piece.
[01:43:39.619 --> 01:43:40.239]  Great gifts.
[01:43:41.019 --> 01:43:44.660]  You got the non-generic bottles, the exact same bottle, just fancier labeling.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:46.501]  For how many or five of those, 130 you said?
[01:43:47.963 --> 01:43:53.381]  You can get the, well, the generic labeled ones are $99 and the regular label ones are $155.
[01:43:55.698 --> 01:43:59.079]  They were at 135 until the end of November.
[01:43:59.279 --> 01:44:00.019]  Well, it's simple.
[01:44:00.039 --> 01:44:02.519]  There's a lot of poison in the water and people just don't know it.
[01:44:02.559 --> 01:44:10.721]  And when you taste all that bad taste in the water, wait until you've been drinking real purified water for a long time and then drink tap water again.
[01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:11.661]  It will even taste worse.
[01:44:11.721 --> 01:44:15.842]  And remember, most of your bottled water is municipal water that's just been filtered.
[01:44:16.242 --> 01:44:17.983]  And a lot of times bacteria get in there and grow.
[01:44:18.043 --> 01:44:19.683]  And major studies show it's a lot more
[01:44:20.555 --> 01:44:21.216]  We're good to go.
[01:44:44.515 --> 01:44:49.499]  And we'll get you up and on the air, or you can simply go to Berkeywater.com.
[01:44:49.519 --> 01:44:51.440]  You can also get them at Infowars.com.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:57.284]  We take the orders, fax the order over to Debbie, and it goes out that same day, so there's no delay there.
[01:44:57.344 --> 01:45:03.568]  That's Berkeywater.com or Infowars.com or 888-803-4438.
[01:45:03.929 --> 01:45:05.110]  And Debbie, you know I love you.
[01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:06.430]  You're a real sweetie pie.
[01:45:06.451 --> 01:45:11.574]  The times I've gotten to meet you, and you just bring such great service to the people that order from you, and take care.
[01:45:11.594 --> 01:45:12.195]  Thank you.
[01:45:13.135 --> 01:45:13.495]  You bet.
[01:45:13.856 --> 01:45:15.597]  It's a great weight on me, folks.
[01:45:17.939 --> 01:45:25.865]  I get into self-denial sometimes about the danger of what I do, but I always, when I face it, I recommit and move forward.
[01:45:25.905 --> 01:45:35.532]  I've told the stories before about how every once in a while when my shields aren't up, my conscious shields, and I'll wake up at 4 a.m.
[01:45:35.572 --> 01:45:38.895]  covered in sweat and think, my gosh, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.280]  I mean, I am out here fighting these people at point-blank range.
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.281]  They all know exactly who I am.
[01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:50.022]  And I kind of see how I get more and more at the forefront of things, and it becomes daunting.
[01:45:50.742 --> 01:45:52.382]  But at the same time, it becomes empowering.
[01:45:52.442 --> 01:45:54.863]  And my only frustration is I don't do that good of a job.
[01:45:54.883 --> 01:45:58.043]  I don't cover all the things I should cover.
[01:45:58.103 --> 01:46:02.324]  I'm not able to articulate my full understanding of things that I need to impart.
[01:46:02.384 --> 01:46:05.365]  Not that it's something special, but it's something you need to know.
[01:46:05.385 --> 01:46:07.585]  I think my views are unusually accurate.
[01:46:09.011 --> 01:46:11.253]  So frankly, I guess it is somewhat special.
[01:46:11.273 --> 01:46:12.013]  We're all special.
[01:46:12.053 --> 01:46:15.175]  We all need to impart our knowledge and get informed and inform others.
[01:46:16.076 --> 01:46:21.339]  And my biggest frustration is just not being able to fight these people.
[01:46:21.399 --> 01:46:22.460]  Not being here to fight them.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.561]  Not being able to stay in the fight.
[01:46:24.961 --> 01:46:25.902]  That's my only fear.
[01:46:25.962 --> 01:46:27.963]  Not making the films I've dreamed of making.
[01:46:28.023 --> 01:46:31.565]  Not really imparting the information that I need to impart.
[01:46:32.566 --> 01:46:35.068]  Not getting down to what really needs to be done.
[01:46:36.368 --> 01:46:37.209]  Not being here.
[01:46:37.947 --> 01:46:43.633]  To see all the other people that are going to wake up and how this fight's going to play out.
[01:46:45.435 --> 01:46:58.849]  But, I mean seriously folks, I mean it's scary to consciously go, man this company, that is elements of it, of DynCorp, kidnapped with the United Nations 200,000 women and children.
[01:47:01.343 --> 01:47:02.904]  I mean, the numbers of that.
[01:47:03.445 --> 01:47:04.866]  And shipped them all over the world.
[01:47:04.966 --> 01:47:07.007]  And to know that it's just something our news doesn't talk about.
[01:47:07.027 --> 01:47:14.693]  You just don't talk about the slave brothels in Israel and Saudi Arabia and over in Asia, Thailand and places.
[01:47:15.054 --> 01:47:17.115]  And they even have some cruise ships.
[01:47:17.155 --> 01:47:25.702]  There was even a World Net Daily, God bless them, they did one report on it, about a big Bill Clinton Democratic staff party, week-long party on a slave ship with slave whores.
[01:47:26.743 --> 01:47:27.623]  You can call them whores.
[01:47:28.945 --> 01:47:30.206]  God forgive me.
[01:47:30.226 --> 01:47:30.867]  What do you call them?
[01:47:30.927 --> 01:47:31.627]  Slave women?
[01:47:31.647 --> 01:47:32.208]  Sex slaves?
[01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:37.131]  To actually face that, I mean that's real.
[01:47:37.191 --> 01:47:38.132]  They were caught.
[01:47:39.253 --> 01:47:40.654]  And to know they sit around.
[01:47:40.734 --> 01:47:42.916]  I mean what in the world is wrong with you?
[01:47:43.176 --> 01:47:44.037]  You mercenaries.
[01:47:44.517 --> 01:47:52.363]  I'm bad because your company did that and you control a lot of the government so nothing happened to you?
[01:47:52.423 --> 01:47:53.104]  I mean you people
[01:47:53.812 --> 01:47:56.332]  You just think we're here to... You think we're like a chicken.
[01:47:56.372 --> 01:48:03.514]  You want to eat a chicken, you go break our neck in the yard and go, go, go pull our gizzard out and pull our guts out and stuff us and put us in the oven.
[01:48:03.534 --> 01:48:05.794]  I mean, you treat us just like we're cattle.
[01:48:06.394 --> 01:48:13.275]  You treat us like we're a Coca-Cola to pull out of the refrigerator and pop the top on and just slurp us down like we don't exist, you pieces of filth.
[01:48:14.255 --> 01:48:15.096]  What's wrong with you?
[01:48:15.116 --> 01:48:16.616]  How do you operate like this?
[01:48:17.156 --> 01:48:18.536]  How do you not have a conscience?
[01:48:19.076 --> 01:48:20.717]  How do you do what you do?
[01:48:20.857 --> 01:48:22.917]  And then how do you people out there not fight them?
[01:48:24.182 --> 01:48:25.402]  I'll tell you, I know what I gotta do.
[01:48:25.462 --> 01:48:28.223]  I need to go down there and start bullhorning that dying corps facility.
[01:48:28.663 --> 01:48:30.243]  I need to really start exposing them.
[01:48:30.263 --> 01:48:33.604]  You know, the hair on the back of my neck stands up whenever I talk about them.
[01:48:34.044 --> 01:48:35.424]  I know what it is, okay?
[01:48:35.624 --> 01:48:36.744]  I know what I'm doing.
[01:48:36.904 --> 01:48:38.084]  But it's gotta be done!
[01:48:38.344 --> 01:48:44.246]  And if we'd all just stand up, we could take these people, and we could try them, and we could hang them up!
[01:48:44.466 --> 01:48:45.606]  We could hang them up!
[01:48:45.826 --> 01:48:48.486]  We could take this filth and put them in hell!
[01:48:50.527 --> 01:48:52.507]  We could do what we're supposed to do.
[01:48:53.277 --> 01:48:54.037]  But you know what?
[01:48:55.738 --> 01:48:58.138]  Our government's been seized by terrorists!
[01:48:59.399 --> 01:49:04.500]  And I want Austin cops to know, when you drive by the CSC building, most of those people aren't bad in that building.
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.381]  Most of them are off doing compartmentalized jobs.
[01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:16.824]  But I want you to know, a division of that company is the most bloodthirsty, murdering, kidnapping scum that I have ever identified.
[01:49:16.844 --> 01:49:20.224]  I mean, hell, the Soviets just killed you.
[01:49:20.745 --> 01:49:21.925]  Most of the time they didn't rape you.
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:24.180]  And they take your kids for re-education.
[01:49:25.261 --> 01:49:27.361]  But Nazis, you know, they shoot you in the back of the head.
[01:49:27.641 --> 01:49:28.382]  Not these people.
[01:49:30.182 --> 01:49:32.363]  So I'm going to be a bigger man than you ever were.
[01:49:32.643 --> 01:49:34.023]  I'm not afraid of you.
[01:49:34.043 --> 01:49:36.104]  I don't have to go join your evil.
[01:49:36.164 --> 01:49:37.644]  I'm not under your black wings.
[01:49:37.984 --> 01:49:39.225]  I'm not part of your system.
[01:49:39.245 --> 01:49:40.605]  You're a bunch of cowards.
[01:49:40.865 --> 01:49:42.365]  You're a bunch of scum.
[01:49:42.646 --> 01:49:43.886]  You make me sick.
[01:49:45.203 --> 01:49:47.664]  You are total trash.
[01:49:47.684 --> 01:49:50.766]  You think you're strong because you can hurt weak, meek people?
[01:49:51.066 --> 01:49:53.248]  You do that because you're weak!
[01:49:54.808 --> 01:49:57.670]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.930 --> 01:49:59.491]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.851 --> 01:50:04.534]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.854 --> 01:50:11.598]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.918 --> 01:50:13.879]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.099 --> 01:50:16.941]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.041 --> 01:50:21.704]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.904 --> 01:50:26.286]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.546 --> 01:50:33.770]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:36.452]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:53.860 --> 01:51:00.103]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:00.243 --> 01:51:06.406]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.706 --> 01:51:15.130]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:22.394]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.694 --> 01:51:27.517]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.737 --> 01:51:33.121]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.481 --> 01:51:36.563]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:36.904 --> 01:51:44.809]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.909 --> 01:51:45.489]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.995 --> 01:51:55.476]  I think so.
[01:52:10.584 --> 01:52:11.184]  I think so.
[01:52:30.794 --> 01:52:31.554]  We don't need no education
[01:53:03.634 --> 01:53:07.635]  We don't need no thought controls.
[01:53:08.415 --> 01:53:13.277]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[01:53:13.357 --> 01:53:17.018]  Teacher leave their kids alone.
[01:53:33.865 --> 01:53:43.249]  Alright, I'm going to take a few of your calls right now.
[01:53:43.389 --> 01:53:47.371]  Coming up in the next hour, for the full hour, we're honored to have Dean Haglund joining us.
[01:53:47.931 --> 01:53:52.353]  Talk about the new world order, talk about some of the other stuff we've covered in the past, but some new information as well.
[01:53:52.813 --> 01:53:56.134]  We've got links to his website up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:53:57.035 --> 01:54:00.956]  I've got all these callers here and I keep forgetting who's up next.
[01:54:02.117 --> 01:54:02.877]  Who would be next?
[01:54:03.786 --> 01:54:04.787]  Jay in Colorado.
[01:54:04.827 --> 01:54:05.687]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:54:05.747 --> 01:54:06.228]  Go ahead.
[01:54:08.309 --> 01:54:20.376]  I just called to pretty much talk about a couple things that people can do to spread the word without putting themselves out on the line because some people are afraid to get told they're crazy or whatever.
[01:54:20.816 --> 01:54:23.298]  You can just, one, get some of your bumper stickers.
[01:54:23.958 --> 01:54:24.859]  Put them on your cars.
[01:54:24.879 --> 01:54:26.740]  A couple of them so everybody can see them.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:29.682]  Other than that, you can hang stuff up in your window of your car.
[01:54:30.726 --> 01:54:32.007]  No, I agree with you.
[01:54:32.047 --> 01:54:34.528]  There's so much we can do to wake people up.
[01:54:50.015 --> 01:54:52.437]  It's not even hard to sell the truth to people anymore.
[01:54:52.477 --> 01:54:54.479]  We're living in a bizarro police state.
[01:54:54.519 --> 01:54:58.082]  Now they're going to have the TSA goons all over the streets here in Texas.
[01:54:58.642 --> 01:55:02.545]  I mean, it's not just in New York or Illinois or California now.
[01:55:02.585 --> 01:55:07.369]  Now we're going to have federal goons, militarily trained, running around demanding our papers.
[01:55:07.509 --> 01:55:08.190]  It's a joke!
[01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:18.878]  Well, Sid, I find more so than not believing what you're saying or just thinking you're crazy is that, at least with the people I tell, the people I choose to tell,
[01:55:21.249 --> 01:55:26.372]  They seem to just think it's no chance of doing anything about it.
[01:55:26.392 --> 01:55:27.932]  What are they going to do?
[01:55:27.992 --> 01:55:29.113]  That's the response I get.
[01:55:29.713 --> 01:55:36.457]  Probably 99% of the time, even from people that... Well, I'll tell you, there's so much legislation that we've beaten here locally, just a few of us getting involved.
[01:55:36.477 --> 01:55:38.898]  There's so many things nationally that we've fought.
[01:55:39.398 --> 01:55:42.780]  If we weren't involved, things would be exponentially worse.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.142]  Things would be so much more horrible if we weren't involved.
[01:55:46.722 --> 01:55:50.804]  Another problem that a guy was just telling me at work that's all...
[01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:54.407]  I remember your site now and all that stuff, and got your videos.
[01:55:54.847 --> 01:55:59.630]  But he's asking me about, like, what about the false left-right paradigm.
[01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:11.217]  Right now, the only kind of event for the stuff that seems to be, like, you have to take sides with the Democrats right now to go with it, you know what I mean, for any kind of protest or meeting.
[01:56:11.257 --> 01:56:12.598]  And that's how they play it, you see.
[01:56:12.678 --> 01:56:18.282]  And then when the Democrats are in, the Republicans will play the part as the outside party fighting against the elite.
[01:56:18.482 --> 01:56:19.242]  Right, and I don't want to lie.
[01:56:19.262 --> 01:56:20.243]  It's a total double team.
[01:56:21.345 --> 01:56:32.295]  Well, I mean, like, where do you work in your... As far as, like, meetings or groups or even protests or action-type groups, I mean, how many groups are there out there that are not?
[01:56:32.992 --> 01:56:33.533]  One or the other.
[01:56:33.673 --> 01:56:35.515]  We have to stop using their labels.
[01:56:35.535 --> 01:56:37.697]  We have to get way off the use of left or right.
[01:56:37.977 --> 01:56:40.640]  That was not the terms that were used until a hundred years ago.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:46.766]  And the big banks paid for endowments at universities and created what they call modern political science.
[01:56:48.848 --> 01:56:53.253]  And they started telling them that no longer was it freedom versus slavery.
[01:56:53.914 --> 01:56:54.555]  I don't know.
[01:57:07.185 --> 01:57:09.767]  Window dressing, and they give you the illusion of choice.
[01:57:09.847 --> 01:57:13.569]  Everything in this propaganda system is about the illusion of choice.
[01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:14.209]  I'm out of here.
[01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:15.170]  Good questions.
[01:57:15.210 --> 01:57:16.091]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:16.651 --> 01:57:20.413]  Other callers that are holding patiently, Joe, Al, many, many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:57:20.673 --> 01:57:22.775]  Toll free number to join us in the third hour, 800-259-9231.
[01:57:22.795 --> 01:57:31.120]  And we'll leave discussions of DynCorp in this hour and get into 9-11 and many other issues in the next.
[01:57:33.524 --> 01:57:38.146]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.186 --> 01:57:38.906]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.946 --> 01:57:39.626]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.666 --> 01:57:40.786]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.167 --> 01:57:45.408]  You want answers?
[01:57:45.768 --> 01:57:48.809]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.865 --> 01:58:01.567]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.068 --> 01:58:06.150]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:23.738 --> 01:58:30.481]  Alright, my friends, we're now into the third and final hour of this December 15, 2005 Thursday edition.
[01:58:30.861 --> 01:58:43.006]  You know, I got a surprise, I don't know, six, eight months ago, a year ago, I don't remember now, Dean, when Dean Hagwin, who I've watched on the X-Files and who I'd also seen on The Lone Gunman, and I've talked about that particular pilot episode quite a bit because it parallels
[01:58:43.715 --> 01:58:49.418]  It's almost exact parallels with 9-11 when Dean Haglin gave me a call and said, hey, I'm in town.
[01:58:49.438 --> 01:58:52.240]  Or actually, one of his local radio producer friends did.
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:53.160]  And then I called Dean.
[01:58:53.601 --> 01:58:56.802]  And then Dean came over to my house and said, I'm making a little documentary and I want to interview you.
[01:58:56.822 --> 01:58:58.363]  And I said, well, I'm going to interview you.
[01:58:58.403 --> 01:59:00.885]  And then we even got him on the radio for 30 minutes.
[01:59:00.925 --> 01:59:03.366]  But now we've got him for a full hour.
[01:59:03.866 --> 01:59:07.649]  And Dean, of course, has a long bio, a lot of movies, a lot of TV shows.
[01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:09.950]  But he's also a really smart guy.
[01:59:10.996 --> 01:59:12.337]  And very, very informed.
[01:59:12.757 --> 01:59:19.441]  And so he's here to talk with us today and take your calls and go over a plethora of issues.
[01:59:20.261 --> 01:59:26.865]  Dean, I mean, for folks that don't know who you are, why don't you tell the listeners out there just a little bit more about yourself.
[01:59:27.165 --> 01:59:27.446]  Right.
[01:59:27.586 --> 01:59:29.067]  Well, Alex, great to see you again, by the way.
[01:59:29.507 --> 01:59:30.127]  Good to see you.
[01:59:31.568 --> 01:59:37.471]  For those who don't know, I was an actor on The X-Files for nine seasons, ten years, plus our own spin-off, The Lone Gunman.
[01:59:37.932 --> 01:59:39.853]  I'm the one that looked like Garth from Wayne's World.
[01:59:40.413 --> 01:59:42.555]  Thank you very much for everyone who sent in the questions.
[01:59:42.895 --> 01:59:48.981]  Yeah, I had the long blonde hair and the horn-rimmed glasses and the rock t-shirts with the Ramones and all that sort of thing.
[01:59:49.401 --> 01:59:51.043]  You were my favorite character, I have to say.
[01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:54.506]  I was always glad whenever the conspiracy theorist guys popped up.
[01:59:54.546 --> 02:00:04.435]  That's right, and you know, the writers, like Chris Carter and Vince, they were listening to shows like yours and Art Bell and stuff to get a sense of how to write for us and how to do that.
[02:00:04.955 --> 02:00:07.358]  You were major, major influences.
[02:00:07.498 --> 02:00:08.379]  Wow, I'm flattered.
[02:00:08.419 --> 02:00:09.039]  I didn't know that.
[02:00:09.199 --> 02:00:10.020]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:15.125]  They were all keeping tabs on everything, which made the show so relevant back then.
[02:00:15.686 --> 02:00:17.087]  And I thought I hit the big time when...
[02:00:18.214 --> 02:00:22.656]  When the creator of King of the Hill told me that some of the characters on there were after us.
[02:00:22.696 --> 02:00:23.936]  Is that right?
[02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:24.616]  Mike Judge.
[02:00:24.996 --> 02:00:26.617]  Well, you know, the black helicopter people.
[02:00:26.637 --> 02:00:27.977]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:28.117 --> 02:00:30.298]  Blackheading and... Dale in his basement.
[02:00:30.318 --> 02:00:32.119]  Yeah, they kind of combined that character with some others.
[02:00:32.159 --> 02:00:34.340]  You know, they always have them sent to the Axis TV studio.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:36.400]  All the craziness.
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:37.621]  I don't know why we're getting so much attention.
[02:00:37.881 --> 02:00:39.001]  But I like that attention.
[02:00:39.021 --> 02:00:40.622]  It's better than attention from Dimecorp.
[02:00:40.802 --> 02:00:41.542]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:41.862 --> 02:00:43.683]  Though I just heard about that now, that you...
[02:00:44.663 --> 02:00:46.344]  You've been threatened by these guys.
[02:00:46.785 --> 02:00:48.886]  Man, I tell you, these are the guys to be threatened by.
[02:00:49.106 --> 02:00:51.828]  Well, you know, this is just a testament to the good work you're doing.
[02:00:51.868 --> 02:00:56.831]  I mean, if you didn't have that kind of influence, they would just ignore you completely.
[02:00:56.851 --> 02:00:58.372]  It actually just gives me the willies.
[02:00:58.513 --> 02:00:59.873]  That type of evil gives me the...
[02:01:00.974 --> 02:01:01.895]  Where does that come from?
[02:01:01.935 --> 02:01:02.976]  It's like another universe.
[02:01:03.116 --> 02:01:03.716]  It is another.
[02:01:03.776 --> 02:01:15.425]  Well, and it's that level of fear on those corporate structure parts that just indicate that there's a huge cultural shift coming that I've seen over the last year, you know, since we talked in this documentary that I've been showing.
[02:01:16.666 --> 02:01:23.709]  What I've found is that there is something larger going on that is phenomenal, that will, as you said, you know, left, right's an illusion and all that.
[02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:31.994]  We're somehow having this ability to see past these illusions, to see past these power structures, that will just, I think, tear down the walls.
[02:01:32.014 --> 02:01:35.876]  Well, it's like selling icy, frosty lemonades in hell.
[02:01:36.557 --> 02:01:40.619]  I mean, ten, eleven years ago, when I first got started, people were perceptive and receptive.
[02:01:41.179 --> 02:01:43.421]  But nothing, I mean, it's light years now.
[02:01:43.621 --> 02:01:43.881]  Yeah.
[02:01:44.082 --> 02:01:51.928]  I mean, there's almost a danger to that, though, because people are so ready to, you know, I'm wondering two weeks after the London bombing, is it a government operation?
[02:01:52.208 --> 02:01:53.990]  And then mainstream newspapers are saying it.
[02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:57.833]  But I'm also seeing the discernment go up.
[02:01:57.893 --> 02:02:01.255]  People are also getting very discriminating, very selective.
[02:02:01.776 --> 02:02:06.820]  They're seeing through disinfo operations very quickly, which is very encouraging.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:11.304]  It is encouraging, and I think, you know, it's sort of the hundred monkey theory.
[02:02:11.444 --> 02:02:11.984]  You know that one?
[02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:24.575]  There's a larger collective unconsciousness that we're all keen into, and once that happens, then, you know, they can make all the threats they want, they can do all the sort of power grabs and pass all this legislation that turns it into a police state.
[02:02:25.255 --> 02:02:30.137]  I still believe that the larger consciousness, the publicist, will break through.
[02:02:30.197 --> 02:02:30.658]  Oh, I agree.
[02:02:30.698 --> 02:02:32.638]  Let's talk more about that, because what did Gandhi say?
[02:02:32.698 --> 02:02:36.420]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.401]  But the movement will win.
[02:02:38.441 --> 02:02:40.122]  I'm just wondering if I can survive the attack.
[02:02:40.922 --> 02:02:42.463]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:42.483 --> 02:02:42.903]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:52.464]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.764 --> 02:02:54.145]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.345 --> 02:02:56.546]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.686 --> 02:02:58.788]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.048 --> 02:03:04.010]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.331 --> 02:03:08.353]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.613 --> 02:03:10.394]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.474 --> 02:03:21.119]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.259 --> 02:03:23.160]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.242]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[02:03:58.191 --> 02:04:02.852]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.332 --> 02:04:10.055]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:10.455 --> 02:04:22.221]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:22.701 --> 02:04:27.165]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:04:45.539 --> 02:04:48.041]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:04:48.782 --> 02:04:51.404]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:04:52.139 --> 02:05:08.309]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:14.453]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:05:15.279 --> 02:05:23.221]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:05:24.222 --> 02:05:24.722]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:05:24.742 --> 02:05:25.062]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:05:25.082 --> 02:05:25.522]  The call is free.

[02:05:46.733 --> 02:05:52.761]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.382 --> 02:05:56.365]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.874 --> 02:06:16.142]  Alright, we've got about 52 minutes left in this broadcast and Dean Haglin, who again was the star of the X-Files, one of the main stars on the show for nine seasons, ten years, and of course the lone gunman pilot and then one season, which by the way, I did buy on DVD.
[02:06:16.262 --> 02:06:16.722]  Oh, you did?
[02:06:17.182 --> 02:06:17.743]  Do you have it here?
[02:06:17.763 --> 02:06:18.943]  I'll autograph it for you.
[02:06:18.983 --> 02:06:20.604]  No, no, it's actually at the house.
[02:06:21.284 --> 02:06:30.009]  I don't watch much TV, but I'll selectively watch stuff on the DVD player while I'm on the treadmill or the exercise bike so I don't turn into the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
[02:06:30.569 --> 02:06:32.331]  I was going to say, you're looking more trimmed than last year.
[02:06:32.491 --> 02:06:34.653]  Oh God, I just got fatter and fatter.
[02:06:34.793 --> 02:06:41.360]  Well, I was just working all the time, so I'm making myself work out a couple hours a day when I can.
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:48.888]  But side issues, that's where I'm watching the entire season, which I thought was better than the X-Files, personally.
[02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:49.689]  Thank you very much.
[02:06:49.769 --> 02:06:52.311]  Yeah, the writers did too, and they wanted to
[02:06:53.272 --> 02:07:06.401]  You know, bring up a lot more of the, um, the less the ghost stories and the, uh, the poo monsters that they had in the X-Files and go more into the conspiracy, but with the comedic edge, you know, as a way of getting some of these serious things across, but in a lighthearted tone.
[02:07:06.441 --> 02:07:14.266]  You know, Coast to Coast AM, second biggest radio show in the country, it's shifted a lot out of the ghost stories and stuff, uh, into more of the New World Order stuff.
[02:07:14.386 --> 02:07:15.227]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:07:15.467 --> 02:07:22.312]  And the writers were trying to take that show in that direction, in an entertaining fashion, in a way, bringing these ideas into the public forum.
[02:07:22.372 --> 02:07:26.195]  Is that because that's what the fans and the public wanted, or is that because that's what you guys wanted?
[02:07:26.436 --> 02:07:27.897]  I think it was a combination.
[02:07:27.917 --> 02:07:41.908]  You know, the popularity of The Gunman had a large conspiracy contingent to it, and so they were going after that fan base, and less from the shippers and the, you know, who loved Mulder and who loved Scully kind of thing.
[02:07:42.745 --> 02:07:50.612]  A year ago or so, you were in town visiting friends and we hooked up and I had you on the radio and also interviewed you for the TV show, which I really appreciated.
[02:07:50.632 --> 02:07:52.654]  And of course, you're traveling the country making a documentary.
[02:07:52.674 --> 02:07:53.034]  Yeah.
[02:07:53.054 --> 02:07:54.916]  You're also working on some movie things right now.
[02:07:55.796 --> 02:07:57.098]  So we're honored to have you here with us.
[02:07:57.318 --> 02:08:00.781]  But I want to just rehash, maybe get some more comments on it now.
[02:08:02.532 --> 02:08:05.635]  Your pilot episode, tell us about that plot.
[02:08:05.795 --> 02:08:06.636]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:06.696 --> 02:08:19.029]  This was a pilot episode for the Lone Gunman where the basic plot was the gunman had to stop a plane from flying into the World Trade Center eight months before it actually happened.
[02:08:19.629 --> 02:08:41.224]  So, when we got the script, it said, you know, plane, World Trade Center, they filmed an entire airplane, they had a green map screen, so they put the shot of the New York skyline in with the plane flying directly at it, and just seconds before, we get computer control, we get it back to the pilots, and the pilots can pull the plane up and avoid hitting the World Trade Center.
[02:08:41.784 --> 02:08:48.192]  And part of that plot was that, as it said in the script, that this was to start an international war on terror.
[02:08:48.653 --> 02:08:57.644]  That this was, you know, the Cold War's over, and that for the arms race to continue and keep the economy going, that they would start an international war on terror by flying the plane into the World Trade Center.
[02:08:59.608 --> 02:09:05.052]  In fact, I want to play that clip from the Lone Gunman right now.
[02:09:05.132 --> 02:09:10.196]  Go ahead and roll that clip where they're describing why this terrorist event is going to take place.
[02:09:10.516 --> 02:09:15.660]  You have kind of the boss of the conspiracy terrorist talking to his father who's in the government.
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:16.321]  Right.
[02:09:16.441 --> 02:09:17.422]  And so they're talking.
[02:09:17.442 --> 02:09:18.182]  Go ahead and roll that.
[02:09:20.864 --> 02:09:23.406]  We know it's a war game scenario.
[02:09:23.486 --> 02:09:25.468]  It has to do with airline counter-terrorism.
[02:09:26.989 --> 02:09:28.270]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[02:09:29.113 --> 02:09:30.433]  Because it's no longer a game.
[02:09:30.454 --> 02:09:38.536]  But if some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[02:09:38.556 --> 02:09:40.537]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[02:09:40.557 --> 02:09:44.278]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[02:09:46.779 --> 02:09:50.361]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic airline?
[02:09:50.381 --> 02:09:50.821]  There you go!
[02:09:51.361 --> 02:09:52.942]  Dating the entire government, as usual.
[02:09:52.962 --> 02:09:54.102]  It's a faction.
[02:09:54.462 --> 02:09:55.503]  A small faction.
[02:09:55.523 --> 02:09:56.603]  For what possible gain?
[02:09:57.714 --> 02:09:59.215]  The Cold War's over, John.
[02:09:59.895 --> 02:10:02.997]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[02:10:03.597 --> 02:10:15.624]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world, just clamoring to take responsibility, and begging to be smart-bombed.
[02:10:16.125 --> 02:10:16.965]  I can't believe it.
[02:10:16.985 --> 02:10:18.566]  This is about increasing arms sales.
[02:10:21.368 --> 02:10:21.588]  When?
[02:10:22.528 --> 02:10:22.889]  Tonight.
[02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:25.290]  How are you going to stop it?
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:29.202]  That's what it looks like.
[02:10:29.302 --> 02:10:30.443]  Right.
[02:10:30.563 --> 02:10:31.283]  Remote access.
[02:10:31.303 --> 02:10:32.805]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane.
[02:10:32.965 --> 02:10:33.265]  That's me.
[02:10:33.385 --> 02:10:34.106]  That's right.
[02:10:34.766 --> 02:10:36.027]  I'm mapping the data now.
[02:10:46.065 --> 02:10:56.888]  Yeah, he's on the team, we're on the ground, on the cell phone, on the phone, we're playing, communicating with each other.
[02:10:56.988 --> 02:11:03.130]  You know, I actually bought the DVDs of this, this is just ripped off the left, so the audio isn't the best.
[02:11:03.190 --> 02:11:04.190]  Here it is.
[02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:04.890]  Stop.
[02:11:05.010 --> 02:11:06.010]  In exactly 22 minutes.
[02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:07.931]  Order of Liberty in Washington.
[02:11:08.011 --> 02:11:08.511]  Or Manhattan.
[02:11:14.451 --> 02:11:16.513]  I'm going to crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[02:11:16.993 --> 02:11:18.274]  I'll sell the flight.
[02:11:18.995 --> 02:11:20.116]  Alright.
[02:11:20.696 --> 02:11:23.999]  Now we shot that in March of 2000.
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:30.324]  So that script was written probably around January, February 2000.
[02:11:30.785 --> 02:11:36.169]  And then that aired, that would have been September I think, or maybe even January 2001.
[02:11:37.634 --> 02:11:39.076]  Because it was a mid-season replacement.
[02:11:39.157 --> 02:11:41.300]  And then, September 2001, it happened.
[02:11:41.581 --> 02:11:42.762]  And I didn't even put it together.
[02:11:42.782 --> 02:11:46.609]  It was the writers who actually called me in the afternoon going, are you watching this?
[02:11:47.456 --> 02:11:49.477]  Well, one of the writers from the New York Times was calling me.
[02:11:49.617 --> 02:11:51.158]  You'd been fixing your sink, right?
[02:11:51.238 --> 02:11:51.799]  Exactly!
[02:11:51.859 --> 02:11:52.519]  You remember that?
[02:11:52.559 --> 02:11:54.640]  Yeah, my sink went.
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.621]  I was at Home Depot.
[02:11:56.061 --> 02:11:58.802]  I had other issues than watching TV all day.
[02:11:59.222 --> 02:12:02.644]  And then suddenly it all gelled together all at once.
[02:12:02.824 --> 02:12:06.827]  That's kind of good that you were so unplugged from mainstream media that you didn't even know it was happening.
[02:12:07.547 --> 02:12:08.728]  Well, I heard about it.
[02:12:08.788 --> 02:12:10.088]  I knew it right when it happened.
[02:12:10.108 --> 02:12:11.229]  Well, sure enough, so they called you.
[02:12:11.409 --> 02:12:13.290]  But you hadn't gotten all the details, I understand.
[02:12:13.410 --> 02:12:15.031]  Yeah, yeah, it was really amazing.
[02:12:15.432 --> 02:12:18.054]  And it was a great day to go to Home Depot that day, by the way, I should point that out.
[02:12:18.094 --> 02:12:18.695]  Nobody was there.
[02:12:18.755 --> 02:12:20.196]  Nobody was there, and everybody was really helpful.
[02:12:20.356 --> 02:12:22.878]  So, so, so Chris Carter called you up.
[02:12:23.219 --> 02:12:27.783]  Yeah, it was actually Vince, Vince Gilligan, who called me up and said, are you watching that?
[02:12:27.803 --> 02:12:28.383]  Because Vince was...
[02:12:30.105 --> 02:12:33.970]  He was the real spearhead for getting The Gunman to the air.
[02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:42.180]  Chris Carter and everybody were involved in writing it, but they were also involved with trying to save Season 8 of The X-Files and bring that show to a close somehow.
[02:12:42.641 --> 02:12:44.203]  So the focus was split.
[02:12:44.243 --> 02:12:47.948]  The writers were writing Lone Gunman episodes and writing X-Files episodes at the same time.
[02:12:48.288 --> 02:12:56.557]  I actually saw news articles where Ashcroft went to Hollywood right after 9-11 and said, no more bad stories on us.
[02:12:56.577 --> 02:12:57.718]  We want you to work with us.
[02:12:58.038 --> 02:13:04.064]  And then I remember hearing in a news article that Fox didn't like the government because it was anti-government.
[02:13:04.405 --> 02:13:08.068]  And then I remember seeing that you guys had gotten good ratings and it was a very popular series.
[02:13:08.429 --> 02:13:09.690]  Why cancel a winner?
[02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:22.038]  Yeah, well, you know, there's a series of reasons, including I wrote a comic book called Why The Lone Gunman Was Cancelled, because it's such an involved story that involves not just, you know, bad ratings, I'll get off the air.
[02:13:22.058 --> 02:13:26.181]  The ratings were good, the show was fairly, you know, inexpensive.
[02:13:26.201 --> 02:13:29.403]  We were shooting up in Vancouver, so it wasn't above cost.
[02:13:29.583 --> 02:13:35.807]  Chris Carter and Fox at this point started having a bad relationship, so that may have played into it.
[02:13:36.227 --> 02:13:41.551]  But yeah, there may have been a larger... Well, just a microcosm of that.
[02:13:41.571 --> 02:13:51.057]  I mean, I've been on local radio, and number one show at night, against everything, making the station tons of money, and they just said, stop talking about the government, or you're fired.
[02:13:51.137 --> 02:13:52.838]  And I didn't shut up, and they fired me.
[02:13:52.878 --> 02:13:54.379]  So they had people lean on them.
[02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:55.820]  That's just at a local level.
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.981]  Now it's come out about
[02:13:57.661 --> 02:14:04.027]  Hundreds and hundreds, and I'm telling you it's thousands of reporters on government payrolls, not just in Iraq with fake news, but fake news here.
[02:14:04.348 --> 02:14:14.357]  Fake news here, and not only that, Chris Carter tells a story, and I met the psychic who was hired by the CIA just to hang out at Hollywood parties.
[02:14:14.737 --> 02:14:17.700]  And then go back and drop emails about what she talked about.
[02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:26.107]  And this was the CIA keeping tabs on producers and writers of Hollywood movies, because that's the... Because the psychic with them is like their psychologist.
[02:14:26.127 --> 02:14:27.208]  These people spill their guts.
[02:14:27.248 --> 02:14:28.029]  They spill their guts.
[02:14:28.089 --> 02:14:31.472]  And she went up to Chris Carter, who was at a party, way in the back.
[02:14:31.512 --> 02:14:34.014]  She said, whatever you're working on is going to make you millions of dollars.
[02:14:34.374 --> 02:14:36.216]  And this was before he had launched the X-Files.
[02:14:36.276 --> 02:14:39.259]  And he actually told that same story.
[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:45.403]  Also, you guys talked about the CIA, NASA, others planting ideas and scripts.
[02:14:45.624 --> 02:14:46.164]  I mean, come on.
[02:14:46.564 --> 02:14:48.546]  This is exactly what happened on 9-11.
[02:14:48.886 --> 02:14:53.770]  There is a government drill, actually five drills going on, of flying planes into the very buildings.
[02:14:54.130 --> 02:14:55.291]  Now that's USA Today, folks.
[02:14:55.611 --> 02:14:59.234]  We told you that from our sources two and a half years before it was in USA Today.
[02:14:59.294 --> 02:14:59.975]  Now it's admitted.
[02:15:00.939 --> 02:15:02.820]  Okay, but we have this from our sources.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.101]  Now it's admitted they have this drill.
[02:15:04.561 --> 02:15:17.329]  In the Lone Gunman pilot episode, this criminal group of the government is going to use a drill to make the rest of the government stand down, and they're going to fly it into the air to attack Afghanistan, to smart bomb the Tin Horn Dictators.
[02:15:17.369 --> 02:15:18.110]  I mean, you cannot
[02:15:18.730 --> 02:15:19.672]  Get any closer.
[02:15:19.952 --> 02:15:20.272]  I know.
[02:15:20.413 --> 02:15:23.777]  And then to say, oh, we had no indication that this would ever happen.
[02:15:23.817 --> 02:15:25.178]  This was like the government's position.
[02:15:25.198 --> 02:15:27.601]  There was no information that this would happen.
[02:15:27.902 --> 02:15:28.482]  It was everywhere.
[02:15:28.583 --> 02:15:29.924]  It was in your popular media.
[02:15:29.944 --> 02:15:31.026]  It's in your books, you know.
[02:15:31.246 --> 02:15:33.909]  Specifically, were you able to talk to Chris Carter and others?
[02:15:33.969 --> 02:15:36.172]  I mean, was that storyline planted on them?
[02:15:36.192 --> 02:15:36.913]  Where did they get that?
[02:15:38.057 --> 02:15:40.440]  They said they got it from a Tom Clancy novel.
[02:15:41.241 --> 02:15:41.761]  I forget which one.
[02:15:41.781 --> 02:15:44.744]  Which it's admitted that Tom does get that from the intelligence agency.
[02:15:44.905 --> 02:15:48.508]  So it probably was then second or third hand.
[02:15:48.548 --> 02:15:51.291]  There's a drill to make everybody stand out, but his book doesn't do that.
[02:15:51.331 --> 02:15:52.132]  That part was added.
[02:15:54.254 --> 02:15:56.256]  The mathematical chance of that happening.
[02:15:57.296 --> 02:15:59.257]  What about the New York Lottery coming up 9-1-1?
[02:16:00.298 --> 02:16:01.239]  On 9-1-1 the year after?
[02:16:01.439 --> 02:16:04.781]  What about the Chicago Mercantile coming up 9-1-1 with a bunch of zeros after it?
[02:16:05.041 --> 02:16:06.542]  I mean, that was like 1 out of 14 billion.
[02:16:06.582 --> 02:16:07.663]  Yeah, what are the odds of that?
[02:16:07.823 --> 02:16:08.683]  And how does that work?
[02:16:08.743 --> 02:16:19.010]  And this thing goes back to a collective unconscious idea that, you know, there is a larger subconscious idea going on that then influences our reality around us.
[02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.511]  We know from what's even declassified.
[02:16:20.531 --> 02:16:29.038]  They're trying to actually program that through, and I know that we need to see symbols to somehow control that collective unconscious that they're trying to program with these subliminals.
[02:16:29.118 --> 02:16:40.687]  Yeah, well, and I don't know how much that works, because it'll go in both directions, and showing you and others and, you know, everybody doing this kind of work sort of will, you know, make a groundswell going the other way.
[02:16:41.227 --> 02:16:44.849]  Dean, I want to go to break and I want to come back and find out what you think of the torture.
[02:16:44.869 --> 02:16:46.630]  I have no idea what your views are.
[02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:49.231]  What do you think of the Pentagon domestic surveillance in America?
[02:16:49.251 --> 02:16:53.133]  These announcements that federal troops are going to march around on our street corners now.
[02:16:53.313 --> 02:16:53.973]  I just heard that.
[02:16:54.153 --> 02:16:54.874]  Shake us down.
[02:16:56.114 --> 02:16:59.536]  Homeland Security, quote, fight terrorists and drugs or terrorism.
[02:16:59.556 --> 02:17:02.337]  So we have neighborhood groups with the military watching us.
[02:17:02.897 --> 02:17:08.020]  I want to get your views on all of this, but then it's okay because Don King says George Bush is good.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:12.742]  Right, and I get all my moral upbringing from Doug King.
[02:17:12.942 --> 02:17:13.983]  A convicted murderer.
[02:17:14.023 --> 02:17:14.663]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:14.683 --> 02:17:18.025]  I hadn't heard that one actually.
[02:17:18.565 --> 02:17:20.426]  Yeah, it's new.
[02:17:20.686 --> 02:17:27.190]  And of course, all over the country a rash of students getting expelled and suspended for removing the cameras in the potty.
[02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:28.991]  That's our big brother helping us.
[02:17:29.091 --> 02:17:30.852]  Wow, I didn't know there were cameras in the potty.
[02:17:31.642 --> 02:17:32.903]  Oh yeah, that's how they keep us safe.
[02:17:33.063 --> 02:17:38.885]  I went to a hip bar in London and they broadcast the camera in the men's room into the ladies' room.
[02:17:39.205 --> 02:17:39.545]  Really?
[02:17:39.565 --> 02:17:39.845]  Yeah.
[02:17:40.305 --> 02:17:41.485]  It's very hip.
[02:17:41.525 --> 02:17:44.687]  We'll be right back.

[02:21:41.685 --> 02:21:57.568]  Alright, folks, we're back live and I promise we'll go to your calls, questions, comments for Dean Haglin coming up in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:21:57.588 --> 02:22:01.529]  Dean, there's a lot of different issues that you want to get into and I want to cover.
[02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:11.291]  What's happening with the Patriot Act?
[02:22:11.311 --> 02:22:25.279]  What's happening with all this stuff about overt troops on the streets, and gun confiscations in New Orleans, and congressmen caught with hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen defense funds?
[02:22:26.019 --> 02:22:27.220]  You talk about people waking up.
[02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:29.101]  What about inside the Hollywood structure?
[02:22:29.141 --> 02:22:30.201]  Are people starting to wake up there?
[02:22:30.461 --> 02:22:33.723]  They are, but again, Hollywood does run on fear, so if you want to do a military script,
[02:22:37.445 --> 02:22:44.207]  Uh, it has to be pro-military or else you don't get the Pentagon giving you the tanks or the information and you don't get a consultant.
[02:22:44.667 --> 02:22:46.248]  So your information looks way off.
[02:22:46.348 --> 02:22:46.968]  Oh, I've seen that.
[02:22:47.008 --> 02:22:50.049]  And they'll refuse something that's 98% pro-military.
[02:22:50.329 --> 02:22:53.010]  It's gotta be crackerjack corny worship.
[02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.890]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:54.410 --> 02:23:00.212]  And I have friends who have written scripts that were, you know, anti-war, anti-military.
[02:23:00.772 --> 02:23:07.661]  And their agents, their agents just say, you know what, it's a great script, I'm sure it'll be fabulous, we're not going to do it.
[02:23:07.921 --> 02:23:10.945]  Because we know that it's going to be blocked, that we're not going to get funding.
[02:23:11.425 --> 02:23:13.949]  You know, these movies cost $20, $60 million to make.
[02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:18.214]  That money doesn't come from some guy down the street out of his, you know, checkbook.
[02:23:18.234 --> 02:23:18.875]  These come from
[02:23:19.275 --> 02:23:23.119]  Huge venture capitalists that have huge corporate interest.
[02:23:23.139 --> 02:23:27.342]  Well, Carlisle Group is buying into... They just bought one of the biggest theater chains in the country.
[02:23:27.362 --> 02:23:28.684]  They're trying to buy Columbia.
[02:23:29.364 --> 02:23:30.565]  They're buying TV stations.
[02:23:30.605 --> 02:23:39.033]  That's right, and yet there's this independent film thing, like John Greenwald doing Outfoxed and The High Cost of Low Prices, the story at Walmart.
[02:23:39.373 --> 02:23:44.057]  He's doing these really independent documentaries that are huge hits.
[02:23:45.058 --> 02:23:51.023]  But they're being distributed through channels like straight-to-DVD.
[02:23:51.103 --> 02:23:54.686]  You've got DVD and theatrical at the same time, which is rare.
[02:23:54.746 --> 02:23:56.007]  Normally you show it in the theaters.
[02:23:56.107 --> 02:24:00.651]  And that's good because you've got an audience, and that audience for alternative stuff is growing.
[02:24:00.711 --> 02:24:06.336]  You were telling me about a Hollywood 9-11 nexus point with Alex Lightman?
[02:24:06.396 --> 02:24:11.120]  Yeah, he's writing a book about the connection between Al-Qaeda and Hollywood.
[02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:30.999]  And apparently, now I don't know if this is true, but this is what he told me at DragonCon or at San Diego Comic-Con last year, is that the senior officials call themselves Al-Qaeda based on the translation of the Isaac Asimov book called The Club or The Group.
[02:24:31.279 --> 02:24:31.759]  Do you know this?
[02:24:32.019 --> 02:24:32.319]  Yes.
[02:24:32.559 --> 02:24:38.662]  Yeah, and that the Al-Qaeda seniors are very much into science fiction.
[02:24:39.366 --> 02:24:53.193]  And they had three or four different plans going on and their watching of the lone gunman was the one that made them go into the, you know, they were tied to the government to go and launch a plane strike into the World Trade Center.
[02:24:54.261 --> 02:24:55.382]  Now, I don't know if that's true.
[02:24:55.402 --> 02:24:57.784]  So he's saying he's getting this information.
[02:24:58.104 --> 02:25:00.686]  So you guys making the film made them do that?
[02:25:00.846 --> 02:25:01.607]  That's what he said.
[02:25:01.687 --> 02:25:06.671]  But then, at the same time, the government would have had to watch and have drills, too, just for Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:06.711 --> 02:25:10.134]  Well, he's saying that Al-Qaeda is working with the government already.
[02:25:10.174 --> 02:25:12.196]  That they were funded and all of that.
[02:25:12.396 --> 02:25:13.356]  I've got to interview him.
[02:25:14.337 --> 02:25:15.398]  So who is Alex Lightman?
[02:25:15.518 --> 02:25:16.719]  Alex Lightman, I've got his business card.
[02:25:16.779 --> 02:25:17.440]  I'll give it to you.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.901]  I'll get it to your email.
[02:25:18.941 --> 02:25:23.825]  He's an author, and he's been working on getting in a high-level Al-Qaeda reps.
[02:25:24.206 --> 02:25:25.228]  Well, I know this.
[02:25:25.248 --> 02:25:26.110]  A lot of so-called Arab or
[02:25:33.234 --> 02:25:38.975]  Or Central Asian terrorist leaders are government agents, or it's more like global corporations fund them.
[02:25:39.255 --> 02:25:51.698]  Then they go out and recruit 18-year-old kids that come from a dirt-poor place and are devout Muslims, and tell them, you're going to fight a big jihad, you're going to go do this, and they activate them to carry out bombings in Israel, right when there's about to be a peace deal that the Likudniks don't want.
[02:25:51.918 --> 02:25:52.338]  Exactly.
[02:25:52.398 --> 02:25:59.279]  And then it's even been in the Jerusalem Post and other papers, and UPI has reported on it, that they go grab these 14-year-old kids that are throwing rocks.
[02:25:59.899 --> 02:26:10.183]  Ten years later, they'll release them after torture, brainwashing, as their boys, and then they caught them, uh, pulled Al-Qaeda squads that arm Assad Arabs that are controlled.
[02:26:10.383 --> 02:26:15.365]  Right, and so, and all again, this comes from a larger corporate structure.
[02:26:15.525 --> 02:26:17.026]  It's about the money in more than...
[02:26:17.566 --> 02:26:18.607]  You know, I don't know.
[02:26:18.747 --> 02:26:21.508]  Like you said, it's an illusion of left and right and all those sorts of things.
[02:26:21.528 --> 02:26:34.596]  So we need to get people to reach out, and you know, in these Arab ghettos and Palestinian ghettos, and I know that actually they are waking up there, that suicide bombing is not good, and most of the time it's got strings attached to it.
[02:26:34.776 --> 02:26:35.276]  Absolutely.
[02:26:35.476 --> 02:26:37.457]  And as you said, they are waking up.
[02:26:37.597 --> 02:26:39.438]  And I see that, you know, everywhere I travel.
[02:26:39.458 --> 02:26:42.080]  I was in Europe extensively over this last
[02:26:43.061 --> 02:26:44.002]  Uh, three or four months.
[02:26:44.162 --> 02:26:44.823]  But that was fun.
[02:26:45.023 --> 02:26:45.784]  That was a lot of fun.
[02:26:46.084 --> 02:26:52.171]  Though my hard drive crashed in Holland, so I just want to say I lost pretty much that whole documentary that we were shooting.
[02:26:52.732 --> 02:26:55.836]  I have the original footage, but I had cut it to about an hour and a half.
[02:26:55.976 --> 02:26:57.057]  It was just on my hard drive.
[02:26:57.237 --> 02:26:58.479]  Oh, man, you gotta back that up!
[02:26:58.499 --> 02:26:59.640]  I gotta back that up!
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:01.603]  I did a backup five months earlier and I, uh...
[02:27:02.103 --> 02:27:11.286]  You know, I knew erotically, and not that I'm some big filmmaker, but I knew erotically, we upgrade and back up every day, and we're hitting auto-save after every execution.
[02:27:11.586 --> 02:27:11.966]  Ah, see?
[02:27:12.566 --> 02:27:14.547]  Now that's the kind of discipline I should learn from you guys.
[02:27:14.567 --> 02:27:16.207]  Well, actually, I did stuff like you've done.
[02:27:16.588 --> 02:27:16.928]  You have?
[02:27:17.208 --> 02:27:19.028]  Well, take Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:27:19.068 --> 02:27:21.469]  That was five years ago, back on a three-quarter inch tape machine.
[02:27:21.509 --> 02:27:22.109]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:27:22.229 --> 02:27:23.150]  Ate the whole tape.
[02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:24.190]  I had to start over again.
[02:27:24.930 --> 02:27:27.652]  Yeah, that was you talking about pulling your hair out.
[02:27:27.692 --> 02:27:28.212]  Oh my God.
[02:27:28.552 --> 02:27:29.413]  Lessons that you learn.
[02:27:29.633 --> 02:27:30.534]  Yeah, lessons that you learn.
[02:27:30.754 --> 02:27:33.215]  We'll be right back, cover a bunch of other issues and take your calls.
[02:27:33.235 --> 02:27:33.755]  Stay with us.
[02:27:33.816 --> 02:27:34.256]  Right on.
[02:27:36.057 --> 02:27:36.977]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.458 --> 02:27:39.039]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.059 --> 02:27:42.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.173 --> 02:27:48.775]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:27:49.316 --> 02:27:50.638]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:51.078 --> 02:27:53.782]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:54.223 --> 02:27:56.866]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:57.327 --> 02:28:03.756]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:28:04.096 --> 02:28:11.898]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.
[02:28:12.158 --> 02:28:15.679]  LibertyStickers.com can even customize your own bumper stickers.
[02:28:15.859 --> 02:28:17.899]  It's time to stand up for what you believe.
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:19.280]  Invest in your freedom.
[02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:23.961]  Get your stickers at LibertyStickers.com for your family, friends, and community.
[02:28:24.601 --> 02:28:26.062]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:28:26.242 --> 02:28:26.562]  Have you?
[02:28:27.143 --> 02:28:28.664]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:28:29.124 --> 02:28:32.847]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:28:32.867 --> 02:28:36.889]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:28:37.329 --> 02:28:38.390]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:40.131]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[02:28:40.571 --> 02:28:44.194]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:28:45.874 --> 02:28:53.398]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.679 --> 02:29:06.626]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.926 --> 02:29:10.248]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.589 --> 02:29:21.056]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:21.336 --> 02:29:21.836]  That's right!
[02:29:22.016 --> 02:29:29.121]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:33.523]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:29:33.703 --> 02:29:38.166]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.206 --> 02:29:38.666]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:47.371]  Would you like to own a computer?
[02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:50.212]  Would you like to upgrade to a newer, more up-to-date computer?
[02:29:50.333 --> 02:29:56.916]  Do you have no credit, limited credit, bad credit, or even a past bankruptcy that is preventing you from owning the computer you want?
[02:29:57.056 --> 02:29:57.997]  There is a solution.
[02:29:58.297 --> 02:30:04.761]  At FinanceMyPC.com, you are accepted are the words you will hear when applying for the computer you have been looking for.
[02:30:04.941 --> 02:30:06.223]  We're good to go.
[02:30:25.964 --> 02:30:29.765]  Having a computer is a right that everyone deserves, even good people with bad credit.
[02:30:29.925 --> 02:30:36.247]  For a limited time, you will receive a free digital camera when you log on to FinanceMyPC.com and place your order.
[02:30:36.407 --> 02:30:37.387]  Call them today, 1-800-829-9017.
[02:30:37.467 --> 02:30:37.807]  That's 1-800-829-9017.
[02:30:37.827 --> 02:30:39.327]  Or simply log on to FinanceMyPC.com today.
[02:30:49.033 --> 02:30:49.553]  Don't worry.
[02:30:49.994 --> 02:30:51.495]  This show is documented.
[02:30:52.035 --> 02:30:55.318]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.538 --> 02:31:00.242]  We're talking here today with Dean Haglin.
[02:31:00.362 --> 02:31:02.303]  We're about to go to your calls.
[02:31:02.663 --> 02:31:05.385]  Alan and Elizabeth and Larry and Joseph and England.
[02:31:05.426 --> 02:31:10.730]  I want to go to Alan because he's been holding for a long time and then we'll go to Joseph and England after that because he's on his own dime.
[02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:12.491]  Joining us from the United Kingdom.
[02:31:13.448 --> 02:31:15.549]  But, Dean Haglin, tell us about your website.
[02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:17.671]  Oh, my website, DeanHaglin.com.
[02:31:17.811 --> 02:31:19.632]  It's all the information.
[02:31:19.672 --> 02:31:22.654]  In fact, I think I have last year's show still there.
[02:31:22.994 --> 02:31:24.575]  That's right, you've got it archived right there.
[02:31:24.695 --> 02:31:25.916]  I saw that, I was flattered.
[02:31:25.976 --> 02:31:29.638]  That's right, and then there's a link to my new invention, the Chill Pack.
[02:31:30.296 --> 02:31:31.197]  What's not that new now?
[02:31:31.217 --> 02:31:32.538]  Which is smart and simple.
[02:31:32.558 --> 02:31:35.300]  You know, I gave my dad the chill pack I gave him last time.
[02:31:35.781 --> 02:31:38.363]  And he uses it on his little laptop.
[02:31:38.963 --> 02:31:41.565]  And computers compute faster, don't they, with this?
[02:31:41.825 --> 02:31:42.246]  That's right.
[02:31:42.386 --> 02:31:46.089]  Yeah, the secret they don't tell you is that the heat actually affects performance.
[02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:47.790]  And also warps your hard drive.
[02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:53.094]  So, what this is, is a completely freezable mat that you just throw in the freezer, whip it under the laptop.
[02:31:53.114 --> 02:31:56.277]  It's got a condensation-proof material around it, so no moisture develops.
[02:31:56.697 --> 02:31:58.539]  Drops the temperature by at least 70, 80 degrees.
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:04.862]  How long does it stay frozen, or how long does it cool your computer significantly?
[02:32:04.882 --> 02:32:05.663]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:11.706]  It cools it significantly, about one to four hours, depending on the computer, and how many programs you're running, what kind of processing you're doing.
[02:32:12.226 --> 02:32:22.852]  But, I keep mine just at room temperature, and it continues to draw the heat away from the CPU into the gel that's inside that... Oh, exactly, because I've noticed laptops get hot!
[02:32:22.872 --> 02:32:23.672]  They get really hot.
[02:32:23.732 --> 02:32:27.434]  In fact, that's why they call them notebooks now, because they don't want you putting them on your laps,
[02:32:27.894 --> 02:32:29.815]  Because there's three lawsuits out there.
[02:32:29.835 --> 02:32:32.737]  There's a guy suing the Apple and other computers.
[02:32:32.757 --> 02:32:33.357]  Oh, sterility.
[02:32:33.637 --> 02:32:36.859]  Yeah, not just sterility, but they're actually getting blisters on the tip of their penis.
[02:32:36.879 --> 02:32:41.241]  But I don't know why they have their... That's another story that I don't want to hear about in court.
[02:32:41.582 --> 02:32:44.343]  But apparently they are suing for actual blisters.
[02:32:44.363 --> 02:32:46.444]  You know, I actually heard something about laptop suits.
[02:32:46.844 --> 02:32:47.085]  Yeah.
[02:32:47.325 --> 02:32:49.186]  Are they putting off radiation like cell phones?
[02:32:49.246 --> 02:32:49.626]  I guess they are.
[02:32:49.666 --> 02:32:50.927]  No, no, it's the heat.
[02:32:51.007 --> 02:32:55.769]  Yeah, it's the New England Journal said that if you're using a laptop, don't put it in your lap or you'll never have kids.
[02:32:56.390 --> 02:32:56.510]  And...
[02:32:57.610 --> 02:33:02.034]  And so, you know, my... So now they're calling it... Notebooks.
[02:33:02.074 --> 02:33:07.699]  They just call them computer notebooks instead of computer laptops, because they're trying to get you away from using it on your lap.
[02:33:08.059 --> 02:33:11.663]  Well, I never do that anyways, because it's hard to look down into your lap and do it.
[02:33:11.703 --> 02:33:14.345]  Yeah, but the ChillPak you can put under the table, you can put it on the couch.
[02:33:14.365 --> 02:33:15.186]  This is your invention.
[02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:16.847]  Yes, patent it, the whole thing.
[02:33:16.887 --> 02:33:19.029]  Go to ChillPak.com, spelled P-A-K.
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:20.370]  Order yours now.
[02:33:20.390 --> 02:33:22.152]  We can have it shipped out by Christmas.
[02:33:23.753 --> 02:33:25.434]  Well, thank you for my shell pack.
[02:33:25.474 --> 02:33:26.815]  Yes, Merry Christmas, Alex.
[02:33:26.935 --> 02:33:29.537]  I will give this as a gift.
[02:33:30.538 --> 02:33:40.725]  I don't travel around with my laptop as much or always put them on a table, but I might start carrying this because I've noticed that laptops sometimes are real slow, sometimes they're real fast, and so you're saying that's the heat.
[02:33:40.785 --> 02:33:41.305]  That's the heat.
[02:33:41.425 --> 02:33:41.665]  Yeah.
[02:33:41.685 --> 02:33:46.369]  Well, in the old days I heard about how the government, like the NSA in places, would keep things real cold.
[02:33:46.649 --> 02:33:48.310]  Yeah, they would refrigerate the room.
[02:33:48.631 --> 02:33:53.835]  And the fact is, the cooling fans on a lot of the laptops are so small now that they don't actually cool anything.
[02:33:54.255 --> 02:33:56.637]  Plus, the engineers at Apple got drunk.
[02:33:57.177 --> 02:34:06.925]  ...with me one night, and they told me all the flaws, and they said, well the fans are only taking ambient air temperature, and if it's cooler than the air around the CPU, that's the only cooling you're gonna get.
[02:34:07.486 --> 02:34:12.710]  It's not a cooling effect like a wind chill, or the reason it feels cool on your skin is the moisture's evaporating.
[02:34:13.050 --> 02:34:20.056]  There's no moisture on a CPU, so there's nothing to evaporate, so your cooling is only trying to push cooler air outside the laptop.
[02:34:20.836 --> 02:34:23.078]  So it's already 85 degrees or so.
[02:34:23.238 --> 02:34:30.003]  Or yeah, if you're in Hollywood and it's 110 by the pool and you're right, you're just making a convection oven on your processor, which isn't helping at all.
[02:34:30.103 --> 02:34:35.887]  And in fact, it will warp your hard drive, which is why towards the end of your life or your computer, it's completely useless.
[02:34:36.247 --> 02:34:38.488]  Because the head's warped off the actual disc.
[02:34:38.728 --> 02:34:40.088]  Well that is something we all need.
[02:34:40.108 --> 02:34:42.008]  Maybe I can become a distributor of the Chill Pack.
[02:34:42.128 --> 02:34:43.069]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:34:43.129 --> 02:34:43.849]  I would appreciate that.
[02:34:43.869 --> 02:34:47.610]  Like truckloads of them pulling up to the office.
[02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:49.210]  Yeah, and you can use it on your table too.
[02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:53.491]  If you just write on your table, it acts as a buffer so it's not a blanket.
[02:34:53.531 --> 02:34:57.792]  So it's not reflecting heat back and forth between the surface of the table and the bottom of the CPU.
[02:34:58.252 --> 02:35:01.413]  That Chill Pack will allow the heat just to go into that gel and dissipate.
[02:35:01.473 --> 02:35:03.313]  So even without putting it in the refrigerator at work.
[02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:04.634]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:05.876]  Not as effectively, of course.
[02:35:05.896 --> 02:35:09.520]  It doesn't cool it to like, you know, 70, 80 degrees.
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:11.222]  How much faster does it go when you do that?
[02:35:11.302 --> 02:35:17.830]  Well, we're finding our benchmark tests... I'm getting, you know, feedback from people, but it's up to...
[02:35:19.111 --> 02:35:21.612]  We got two computers that ran 110% faster.
[02:35:22.072 --> 02:35:22.392]  Wow!
[02:35:22.512 --> 02:35:23.573]  Yeah, twice as fast.
[02:35:23.973 --> 02:35:27.934]  Now we don't know if that's an anomaly or... I think you start packing my G5s and they're in ice.
[02:35:27.994 --> 02:35:29.915]  Exactly, exactly, that kind of thing.
[02:35:29.955 --> 02:35:31.956]  Though the moisture would probably blow the whole thing up.
[02:35:31.976 --> 02:35:33.276]  No, I'm not joking.
[02:35:33.496 --> 02:35:40.439]  But I have a friend who does sim, you know the sim characters, where you simulate social interaction?
[02:35:41.039 --> 02:35:51.048]  She was running her desktop and her laptop, and she had to turn down all the details on her laptop because it was running so hot, and combining it with the desktop so that she could play online.
[02:35:51.568 --> 02:35:57.473]  Once she had the ChillPak, she unplugged the desktop, turned the details up on her laptop, and just does the laptop to play online.
[02:35:57.513 --> 02:35:59.195]  That's awesome.
[02:35:59.455 --> 02:36:01.076]  Let's take some phone calls.
[02:36:01.417 --> 02:36:02.257]  Allen, you're up first.
[02:36:02.277 --> 02:36:03.358]  Where are you calling from today?
[02:36:03.378 --> 02:36:04.379]  Very interesting show.
[02:36:04.399 --> 02:36:05.620]  I'm calling from Wisconsin.
[02:36:05.921 --> 02:36:06.441]  Welcome, sir.
[02:36:06.461 --> 02:36:06.841]  Go ahead.
[02:36:07.782 --> 02:36:28.651]  Yesterday on the Jerry Brownfield Show, the Genesis Curies, he had the opportunity to have a reporter call in that was in Washington interviewing a meeting between Bush, our so-called Christian Bush, with the other people involved in the meeting regarding the Patriot Bill.
[02:36:28.671 --> 02:36:30.732]  He was trying to get him to pass it.
[02:36:31.613 --> 02:36:36.475]  And what come about was, Mr. Jones, was the fact that he, quote, Bush,
[02:36:37.734 --> 02:36:42.538]  Definitely used God's name in vain.
[02:36:42.918 --> 02:36:55.868]  So you're telling me that now we have confirmed, which his stuff is always confirmed, he was able to have a reporter on who was in that meeting and heard, it was a big congressional meeting, a lot of people were in there.
[02:36:56.749 --> 02:36:57.830]  He used God's name in vain.
[02:36:57.850 --> 02:36:58.231]  Not just GD.
[02:37:17.054 --> 02:37:23.338]  He said, I'm going to say it and I shouldn't, God damn Constitution is nothing more than a piece of paper.
[02:37:23.598 --> 02:37:29.982]  But the point I'm trying to make is everyone's focusing in, I hear Neo-Cons defending him going, well he's a Christian, a lot of Christians say G.D.
[02:37:30.383 --> 02:37:32.564]  The point is he's saying G.D.
[02:37:33.284 --> 02:37:34.985]  about the Constitution.
[02:37:35.025 --> 02:37:36.526]  He's saying he doesn't like it.
[02:37:37.047 --> 02:37:38.268]  That's the really big thing.
[02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:43.263]  And he, he, uh, he, uh... Did the reporters say who they were?
[02:37:43.283 --> 02:37:44.144]  Because I want to know.
[02:37:44.164 --> 02:37:50.448]  Yeah, I got, I copied the show on a video, not a video, but a... No, we've got it in the archives.
[02:37:50.708 --> 02:37:51.809]  What time in the show was it?
[02:37:51.829 --> 02:37:52.710]  We'll try to find it on you.
[02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:56.393]  That comes on before you, which... No, no, no, no, I mean during the hour.
[02:37:56.413 --> 02:37:57.333]  Think back into your brain.
[02:37:57.674 --> 02:38:00.135]  What time during the hour was this said during Brownfield's show?
[02:38:00.235 --> 02:38:02.917]  Well, he brought this out right away.
[02:38:03.618 --> 02:38:04.519]  Right from the beginning.
[02:38:04.539 --> 02:38:06.260]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:07.721]  There he didn't have the reporter on.
[02:38:08.786 --> 02:38:32.381]  No, he's got, he's got, the reporter gave Jerry Brownfield all the, see he, what he did was he asked, excuse me, he asked the aide that asked the question, well isn't that, isn't that, I mean I've been covering the story since last week, I understand that.
[02:38:32.841 --> 02:38:37.684]  I'm saying, and I'm not misunderstanding you, did Jerry Brownfield have a reporter on who was there at the meeting?
[02:38:38.652 --> 02:38:40.013]  Yeah, he was there.
[02:38:40.393 --> 02:38:41.574]  He was there at the meeting.
[02:38:41.854 --> 02:38:42.615]  Okay, that reporter.
[02:38:42.995 --> 02:38:43.436]  Great, sir.
[02:38:43.536 --> 02:38:46.478]  What time during the show did he have this reporter on as a guest?
[02:38:47.273 --> 02:38:48.574]  Oh, it wasn't on his show.
[02:38:48.734 --> 02:38:49.435]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[02:38:49.455 --> 02:38:50.456]  Listen, thank you for the call.
[02:38:50.496 --> 02:38:50.996]  I appreciate it.
[02:38:51.316 --> 02:38:53.338]  Yeah, Alan, we've covered this over and over again.
[02:38:54.199 --> 02:38:57.782]  And what Mr. Thompson gets over Capitol Hill Blues always turned out to be very accurate.
[02:38:57.942 --> 02:38:58.182]  Yeah.
[02:38:58.502 --> 02:39:04.948]  And it just, I mean, he was the one that reported on Bush throwing tempter tantrums, and two years later it was in New York Daily News.
[02:39:04.988 --> 02:39:05.728]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:06.649 --> 02:39:08.591]  And so, you know, I always think Bush is so stupid.
[02:39:08.611 --> 02:39:10.793]  I don't know how much of this is his own doing.
[02:39:11.573 --> 02:39:14.636]  You know, he's uneducated in the best of senses.
[02:39:14.816 --> 02:39:15.116]  And so,
[02:39:16.872 --> 02:39:26.537]  When I hear all of these things, you know, of him doing this and him manipulating that, I think he's just a puppet towards, you know, the larger corporation that's under him doing these things.
[02:39:26.557 --> 02:39:28.918]  He's like a pony with the pony express.
[02:39:28.938 --> 02:39:35.722]  They ride that pony, it gets tired, and back before the telegraph folks, they just jump on the next pony, ride to the, you know, a post rider.
[02:39:35.922 --> 02:39:36.422]  Yeah.
[02:39:36.862 --> 02:39:38.383]  Just riding them from post to post.
[02:39:38.423 --> 02:39:46.067]  And we all get focused on the pony all day, and it's hemming and it's hawing and it's doing its business on the front porch, but really it's just a pony.
[02:39:46.427 --> 02:39:46.847]  That's right.
[02:39:47.048 --> 02:39:49.349]  Whipping boy for the larger corporations.
[02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:50.850]  Let's talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:51.730]  Thanks for the call, Alan.
[02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:52.611]  Go ahead, Elizabeth.
[02:39:54.792 --> 02:40:03.537]  Dean is a really refreshing, real person from Hollywood and this is good news about the independent films and getting more of the truth out in Alex.
[02:40:04.244 --> 02:40:16.391]  I want to again, thank you Dean, and I want to again commend you for your unflinching guts in bringing out the Franklin cover-up and the dying core business with the women and the children.
[02:40:16.431 --> 02:40:19.693]  And as you know, you changed my entire life.
[02:40:19.893 --> 02:40:29.719]  You put me into broadcasting because on June 2, 2003, I turned you on for the first time and you were telling about what the elite did with the children.
[02:40:29.739 --> 02:40:31.640]  And I couldn't tolerate this.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:37.021]  And I believe that millions of people, your listeners, will keep the hedge of prayer around you.
[02:40:37.341 --> 02:40:47.403]  And I ask for that right now, because as Colonel Craig Roberts said, his grandfather told him down in the Ozarks before he went to Vietnam, son, you don't need to worry.
[02:40:47.463 --> 02:40:49.704]  You won't be taken home before the Lord is ready.
[02:40:49.764 --> 02:40:53.285]  And Alex, I just tell you, keep up the great work you're doing.
[02:40:53.485 --> 02:40:54.345]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:40:54.405 --> 02:40:59.026]  No, I mean, you know, Computer Science Corporation bought DynCorp, but I know DynCorp is upset
[02:40:59.586 --> 02:41:00.887]  By the things that we've said about him.
[02:41:00.907 --> 02:41:02.548]  But I mean, I'm reading it out of the BBC.
[02:41:03.208 --> 02:41:03.868]  So, I don't know.
[02:41:04.329 --> 02:41:07.410]  I mean, I understand that they need to be ashamed of what... I mean, more than ashamed.
[02:41:07.430 --> 02:41:09.612]  This is just pit of hell behavior.
[02:41:09.792 --> 02:41:15.155]  And Alex, I don't think they should be so stupid as to think to eliminate you will do anything.
[02:41:15.195 --> 02:41:16.475]  They'll just make you a martyr.
[02:41:16.835 --> 02:41:18.837]  Because the groundswell is moving.
[02:41:19.237 --> 02:41:20.678]  Many, many more yuppies.
[02:41:20.798 --> 02:41:25.400]  Many, many more truck drivers across this country know they're learning each day.
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:28.762]  So, I just commend you and thank you very much.
[02:41:28.982 --> 02:41:29.622]  Well, thank you.
[02:41:29.722 --> 02:41:33.924]  I mean, I just hope cops driving by the CSC building know what they're driving past.
[02:41:33.984 --> 02:41:37.165]  I mean, they're driving past, you know, literally where ringwraiths dwell.
[02:41:38.286 --> 02:41:40.307]  CSC, what did they actually put up?
[02:41:40.347 --> 02:41:48.070]  Computer Science Corporation is this big data mining, huge data relay, data storage company.
[02:41:48.390 --> 02:41:49.891]  And I'm not saying CSC's bad.
[02:41:50.171 --> 02:41:51.231]  They bought Dyncor.
[02:41:51.371 --> 02:41:51.712]  I see.
[02:41:51.932 --> 02:41:52.752]  And Dyncor's the what?
[02:41:53.334 --> 02:41:54.935]  Yeah, at least a few years ago they bought them.
[02:41:55.115 --> 02:42:00.219]  And then I heard that some people in CSC from two different sources were saying, we've got to do something to Alex Jones.
[02:42:00.239 --> 02:42:01.700]  We've got to shut him down, bring him down.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:03.621]  I thought that meant technical, because they're technical.
[02:42:03.821 --> 02:42:05.342]  I figured it was just a little group saying that.
[02:42:05.682 --> 02:42:08.144]  Then I get it from another source without me even saying anything about it.
[02:42:08.724 --> 02:42:12.727]  And then I go, wait a minute, I forgot that they bought DynCorp.
[02:42:12.967 --> 02:42:13.788]  So I can't blame them.
[02:42:13.808 --> 02:42:15.409]  I'm saying that DynCorp is a division of that.
[02:42:15.689 --> 02:42:17.430]  DynCorp did this before CSC bought them.
[02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:19.732]  Is that why your server goes out for five minutes on your show?
[02:42:20.012 --> 02:42:24.973]  No, no, that's because we're dumb.
[02:42:27.333 --> 02:42:29.694]  It's hard to serve the numbers of people that want to tune into the show.
[02:42:30.054 --> 02:42:34.275]  That's why we've added more backup streams at InfoWars.com that are secondary.
[02:42:34.955 --> 02:42:37.255]  Let's talk to Larry in North Carolina.
[02:42:37.295 --> 02:42:38.036]  Larry, you're on the air.
[02:42:38.076 --> 02:42:38.476]  Go ahead.
[02:42:38.496 --> 02:42:40.816]  Hello, Dean and Alex.
[02:42:41.236 --> 02:42:44.577]  I was wondering, you know how the government does things.
[02:42:45.377 --> 02:42:49.678]  What would happen if our government told Saddam Hussein
[02:42:50.307 --> 02:42:58.967]  Now, we're going to lessen your sentence if you won't make supervised radio broadcast to the insurgents in Iraq and tell them to lay down their weapons.
[02:42:59.027 --> 02:43:00.230]  They'd probably listen to him.
[02:43:02.473 --> 02:43:05.735]  Well, but they've got to get rid of Saddam because he knows where all the bodies are buried.
[02:43:05.755 --> 02:43:09.478]  I mean, in 58, it's admitted he was a CIA assassin.
[02:43:09.498 --> 02:43:10.919]  They trained him in Egypt for two years.
[02:43:11.319 --> 02:43:13.661]  They put him in as the head of Baathist security in 69.
[02:43:13.721 --> 02:43:15.783]  They got him in as the head Baathist in 79.
[02:43:16.163 --> 02:43:20.146]  They funded him 30 plus million dollars to attack the Iranians, then told him, go ahead and invade Iran.
[02:43:20.826 --> 02:43:21.087]  Too late!
[02:43:21.927 --> 02:43:22.908]  April Gillespie.
[02:43:22.968 --> 02:43:24.208]  So it's a sick joke.
[02:43:24.508 --> 02:43:31.792]  They were knocked over because they were a strong, secular country at first world status with 60% of their graduates being women.
[02:43:32.352 --> 02:43:34.813]  The majority of their doctors graduating were women.
[02:43:35.093 --> 02:43:42.337]  They were a free country with Christians and Jews living in peace and that can't be allowed and now there's an Islamic jihad regime in there and the government's happy.
[02:43:43.183 --> 02:43:43.403]  Yeah.
[02:43:43.904 --> 02:43:44.144]  All right.
[02:43:44.184 --> 02:43:45.245]  You guys have a good one.
[02:43:45.425 --> 02:43:45.765]  Thank you.
[02:43:45.785 --> 02:43:46.146]  You too.
[02:43:46.166 --> 02:43:46.846]  I appreciate it.
[02:43:46.866 --> 02:43:49.028]  Dean, I want to get your comments on the war.
[02:43:49.168 --> 02:43:49.489]  Yeah.
[02:43:49.609 --> 02:43:51.510]  You know, it's actually fascinating.
[02:43:51.530 --> 02:44:03.661]  I've been doing a couple of script works, and now there's another theory about the war, which I don't know if you know about the portal, the Gate of Fire, the Ishtar Gate in Babylon?
[02:44:03.821 --> 02:44:04.102]  Yeah.
[02:44:04.242 --> 02:44:10.067]  Well, there's a lot of people that are saying that the elites want all those antiquities and that there's some
[02:44:10.247 --> 02:44:10.908]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:44:28.522 --> 02:44:29.943]  In fact, they do want to go in there to get goodies.
[02:44:30.063 --> 02:44:32.404]  Yeah, and there's pictures of the U.S.
[02:44:32.444 --> 02:44:41.788]  Marines actually prying open the doors to the museum in Baghdad to loot the museum, and particularly they go downstairs to the vaults that had the Sumerian text.
[02:44:41.828 --> 02:44:43.009]  No, no, that's admitted, yes.
[02:44:43.189 --> 02:44:51.373]  And that Sumerian text... Well, actually, I mean, I'm sure you're about to say this, but I have to be very obnoxious, that's my trademark.
[02:44:51.653 --> 02:44:55.375]  No, seriously, the Rosetta Stones, it's how to decode the text.
[02:44:55.575 --> 02:45:10.616]  It's how to decode the text, and that text has the thing about Giglamesh, which is the oldest tale known to man, predating Noah's Flood, and that explains that whoever has this information has unlimited knowledge and unlimited power.
[02:45:10.856 --> 02:45:11.736]  Yeah, I've seen it all.
[02:45:28.865 --> 02:45:31.047]  Well, I just think it's a goody on the side.
[02:45:31.067 --> 02:45:36.891]  You know, while Hitler's helping Mussolini in North Africa, why not run around with a few divisions and try to dig up goodies?
[02:45:37.391 --> 02:45:39.813]  Because, I mean, it's admitted, Hitler thought he'd get power off this.
[02:45:39.833 --> 02:45:41.774]  So regardless, they do believe that.
[02:45:41.814 --> 02:45:46.117]  But it's about weapon sales, oil, domestic diversion, as he told his biographer.
[02:45:46.137 --> 02:45:49.880]  But certainly, our government did, and they disappeared, did loot that stuff.
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:55.764]  And there's three things that Jordan Maxwell pointed out that there's three items that will sort of indicate that our U.S.
[02:45:55.804 --> 02:45:56.725]  government believes this.
[02:45:56.805 --> 02:46:03.169]  And one is that the goddess that guards this portal gate, there's Jehovah, Jawah, on the right, the male entity.
[02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:09.434]  The female entity is Shakti or Shakana, which is why the bombing campaign in Baghdad was called Shock and Awe.
[02:46:09.614 --> 02:46:09.954]  Oh yeah.
[02:46:10.074 --> 02:46:15.679]  So that this was an indication that this female entity that we represent will be coming in and blocking you from entering this gate.
[02:46:16.079 --> 02:46:20.722]  The other one is that Saddam Hussein thought he was the reincarnation of King Nebuchadnezzar.
[02:46:20.742 --> 02:46:21.483]  Which he did think.
[02:46:21.663 --> 02:46:22.424]  Which he did think.
[02:46:22.784 --> 02:46:28.048]  The only tribe King Nebuchadnezzar didn't enslave during his reign were the Moabs.
[02:46:28.508 --> 02:46:33.092]  And what did we name the 21,000 pound bomb that we tested in Florida for everyone to see?
[02:46:33.152 --> 02:46:33.752]  Moabs.
[02:46:33.792 --> 02:46:35.053]  Moabs, mother of all bombs.
[02:46:35.093 --> 02:46:36.394]  We are the tribe you can't enslave.
[02:46:37.779 --> 02:46:55.007]  And then on top of that, if you look at the USA Today, like I can't listen to Bush speak, it just drives me nuts, but I read his speeches, and USA Today had his speech from the RNC in New York City, his acceptance speech, and his opening sentence is, I am answering to a power from beyond the stars.
[02:46:55.627 --> 02:47:00.309]  Now everyone thought that was reference to God, but born-agains don't refer to a God from beyond the stars.
[02:47:01.075 --> 02:47:03.556]  He's referring to a power from beyond the stars.
[02:47:03.576 --> 02:47:06.518]  Well, listen, when you listen to all his speeches, Dean, it's all a cult.
[02:47:06.658 --> 02:47:08.139]  It's all some bizarre cult.
[02:47:08.239 --> 02:47:09.840]  Yeah, that speech he gave.
[02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:12.441]  Again, folks, we're not saying there's really stargates.
[02:47:12.521 --> 02:47:13.482]  At least I'm not.
[02:47:13.502 --> 02:47:14.423]  They really do believe in this.
[02:47:14.963 --> 02:47:17.384]  I mean, that bohemian grove with all this ritualized stuff.
[02:47:17.404 --> 02:47:18.445]  People say, well, it looks like theater.
[02:47:18.705 --> 02:47:20.166]  That's where theater comes from, is ritual.
[02:47:20.606 --> 02:47:21.206]  Absolutely.
[02:47:21.307 --> 02:47:36.938]  And they're there, and they believe they're opening this membrane, and then they address the owl as a female, then as a male, and they're trying to basically do a black magic ritual, like Faust trying to cheat the devil, and they even have some quotes in there out of Faust.
[02:47:36.958 --> 02:47:39.340]  Remember, care is the thing in the box that he can't get to?
[02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:40.021]  That's right, that's right.
[02:47:40.041 --> 02:47:41.082]  And they're trying to kill care?
[02:47:41.102 --> 02:47:41.322]  Yeah.
[02:47:41.342 --> 02:47:42.583]  Well, they are killing it here.
[02:47:42.643 --> 02:47:49.388]  They are taking all their bad vibes, all their bad, whatever you want to call it, reap what you sow karma, and they're trying to dump it into this dimension.
[02:47:49.788 --> 02:47:51.551]  It's very sophisticated black magic.
[02:47:51.631 --> 02:47:57.081]  It's very sophisticated and shocking that it's in such a global... take it to a global level.
[02:47:58.303 --> 02:47:58.784]  They're nuts.
[02:47:58.864 --> 02:47:59.425]  I mean, I know this.
[02:47:59.445 --> 02:47:59.965]  I mean, stop at 101.
[02:48:00.006 --> 02:48:00.566]  Nancy Reagan.
[02:48:03.783 --> 02:48:09.788]  Nancy Reagan, her husband, down to the second he gave a speech, what colors he wore was astrology.
[02:48:09.968 --> 02:48:10.368]  Exactly.
[02:48:10.428 --> 02:48:16.353]  Signing the peace, the Russian accord, at 3.03 p.m., all of that sort of thing.
[02:48:16.853 --> 02:48:20.536]  She had that psychic, he was an astrologer, worked for the government.
[02:48:20.897 --> 02:48:22.218]  That was all they consulted.
[02:48:22.598 --> 02:48:23.479]  So that's public, folks.
[02:48:25.507 --> 02:48:27.989]  And so, so many atheist people go, I don't want to look at that.
[02:48:28.009 --> 02:48:28.630]  I don't believe in that.
[02:48:28.650 --> 02:48:30.111]  It doesn't matter if you don't believe in it.
[02:48:30.412 --> 02:48:30.852]  They do.
[02:48:31.092 --> 02:48:31.513]  That's right.
[02:48:31.653 --> 02:48:33.294]  That's why they put their symbols everywhere.
[02:48:33.335 --> 02:48:36.037]  That's why they think they're getting power off of it.
[02:48:36.357 --> 02:48:37.118]  Final segment.
[02:48:37.138 --> 02:48:38.099]  Boy, this went by fast.
[02:48:38.119 --> 02:48:40.962]  We'll come back and talk to Joseph in England, who's been holding patiently.
[02:48:41.262 --> 02:48:42.503]  Stay with us with Dean Haglund.
[02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:49.745]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.005 --> 02:48:51.566]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.926 --> 02:48:56.609]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.930 --> 02:49:03.654]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.994 --> 02:49:05.976]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.176 --> 02:49:09.019]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.119 --> 02:49:13.783]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.983 --> 02:49:18.387]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.627 --> 02:49:25.854]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.114 --> 02:49:28.536]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.696 --> 02:49:30.418]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:45.862 --> 02:49:47.843]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:49:47.923 --> 02:49:58.627]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:59.007 --> 02:50:03.529]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.609 --> 02:50:14.933]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.533 --> 02:50:22.378]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:22.778 --> 02:50:24.899]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:30.363]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[02:50:30.683 --> 02:50:36.972]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.052 --> 02:50:41.238]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:41.479 --> 02:50:42.220]  That's toll free.
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:42.280]  888-803-4438.
[02:50:47.737 --> 02:50:48.078]  I think so.
[02:51:03.041 --> 02:51:03.642]  I think so.
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:23.460]  I think so.
[02:51:53.487 --> 02:51:54.968]  I'm glad he pops by.
[02:51:55.108 --> 02:51:57.930]  Dean, I want to take a final call from England.
[02:52:09.452 --> 02:52:17.016]  You've got some projects you're working on, and one of them is not the lone gunman, but it's some of the people that you worked with on that.
[02:52:17.276 --> 02:52:19.777]  It is like a conspiracy investigation.
[02:52:19.797 --> 02:52:25.880]  Yeah, like a political thriller with using the three actors, Tom Redford and Bruce Hartwood.
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:31.683]  Yeah, so we'll be shooting that this year, and also I wrote a script about Dr. Royal Raymond Rife.
[02:52:32.347 --> 02:52:39.950]  Who found the cure for cancer in 1935 with the Reich machine and refused to sell to the AMA and then his lab was blown up twice and his assistant poisoned.
[02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:44.052]  He was sued for the rest of his life in San Diego till 1971 when he died.
[02:52:44.572 --> 02:52:46.192]  So that script's coming out too.
[02:52:46.833 --> 02:52:50.194]  Well, you know, it's like the end of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[02:52:50.214 --> 02:52:52.155]  There's that warehouse just full of secrets.
[02:52:52.195 --> 02:52:52.955]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:52:52.975 --> 02:52:57.997]  And they just put it in back and so this is one of those secrets that have come to the fore.
[02:52:58.689 --> 02:53:05.432]  And you're working on a lot of other stuff, and we're always just thankful to have you here with us, here for your second voyage.
[02:53:06.152 --> 02:53:07.592]  Joseph in England, thanks for holding.
[02:53:07.632 --> 02:53:08.453]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:53:08.473 --> 02:53:12.394]  Hi Alex, I've just got a question for Dean.
[02:53:12.474 --> 02:53:26.200]  In respect of your comments earlier regarding the pro-government themes which we see more prevalent in modern TV shows, is there a chance of having a series crossover where the lone gunman might pop up in a future series of 24?
[02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:27.420]  Is that a long shot?
[02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:30.603]  That's not that long a shot, actually.
[02:53:30.623 --> 02:53:37.388]  A lot of the producers, including Howard Gordon and some of the others who used to work on the X-Files, now work on 24.
[02:53:37.849 --> 02:53:43.954]  However, our characters were killed off in Season 8, 9 of the X-Files?
[02:53:44.194 --> 02:53:44.975]  I think Season 9.
[02:53:45.355 --> 02:53:54.763]  They killed us off, but you never saw our bodies in the coffin, so technically we are not available for crossover due to the fact that our characters were killed off.
[02:53:56.024 --> 02:53:59.868]  That being said, that still has to be an agreement between Fox and Chris Carter.
[02:53:59.908 --> 02:54:02.330]  There's talk of an X-Files 2 movie coming out.
[02:54:03.492 --> 02:54:11.520]  Again, licensing and the larger machinations of how Fox works requires all these contracts to be in place.
[02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:18.349]  Yeah, if it's not anti-family, anti-America, anti-gun, Fox won't put it on nowadays because they're so conservative.
[02:54:19.290 --> 02:54:19.751]  That's right.
[02:54:19.811 --> 02:54:21.673]  You know, it's not Pleasure Island.
[02:54:21.733 --> 02:54:24.557]  Can your husband stop from having sex with a porn star?
[02:54:25.358 --> 02:54:26.259]  It's so Christian.
[02:54:26.359 --> 02:54:27.421]  Oh, thank God for Fox.
[02:54:27.801 --> 02:54:29.283]  Anything else there from England?
[02:54:29.303 --> 02:54:29.664]  Real quick.
[02:54:30.882 --> 02:54:31.563]  Yeah, just quickly.
[02:54:31.603 --> 02:54:41.714]  I mean, I've seen, you know, most episodes of Along Come Men, and, um, I'm not surprised it actually got cancelled, because it was actually a good show, and it really covered real, real issues, even though it was a, you know, comedic tone.
[02:54:41.814 --> 02:54:42.855]  Thank you very much, yeah.
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:47.222]  No, I mean, X-Files certainly grew, and then with Lone Gunman, it was a serious show.
[02:54:47.362 --> 02:54:49.423]  I mean, I never watched TV, and I actually watched some of the episodes.
[02:54:49.443 --> 02:54:50.404]  I was like, wow, this is good.
[02:54:50.424 --> 02:54:52.765]  And now I have it on DVD, which is still in stores.
[02:54:52.805 --> 02:54:53.346]  Still in stores.
[02:54:53.406 --> 02:54:55.087]  You can get it at Amazon.com for sure.
[02:54:55.107 --> 02:54:55.947]  Just came back out.
[02:54:56.467 --> 02:54:56.848]  All right.
[02:54:56.868 --> 02:54:58.849]  Well, Dean Haglin, we're almost out of time here.
[02:54:58.889 --> 02:54:59.969]  DeanHaglin.com.
[02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:05.112]  And we've got links to your websites over at Infowars.com, and feel free to post this stuff on the internet.
[02:55:05.292 --> 02:55:05.753]  Absolutely.
[02:55:05.873 --> 02:55:08.114]  And you've been videotaping, we've been videotaping.
[02:55:08.134 --> 02:55:09.335]  We're going to put it up on the website.
[02:55:09.415 --> 02:55:09.755]  Absolutely.
[02:55:09.775 --> 02:55:12.076]  I'm going to cut this into the documentary that still continues.
[02:55:12.236 --> 02:55:13.117]  I'm going to start recutting it.
[02:55:13.417 --> 02:55:16.641]  I can't wait to see that, and I'm sorry to hear you lost it on your machine.
[02:55:16.681 --> 02:55:19.544]  Well, you know, it's part of the process, I guess.
[02:55:20.085 --> 02:55:22.407]  Lessons to back up every day like you guys do.
[02:55:22.788 --> 02:55:26.752]  Do you think we're going to see the military-industrial complex carry out more terror attacks here in the U.S.?
[02:55:27.073 --> 02:55:27.573]  I don't know.
[02:55:27.593 --> 02:55:33.981]  I think that they just need the one to then fuel their larger, greedy plans, so I don't know how many more they have to do.
[02:55:34.973 --> 02:55:38.075]  And then I guess just keep... all these terror drills are the same thing.
[02:55:38.155 --> 02:55:41.558]  It creates the same perception of that we're under terror attack.
[02:55:41.658 --> 02:55:48.143]  Level red, you know, level orange, just it creates the fear that's necessary to have them do their... whatever they have to do.
[02:55:48.183 --> 02:55:51.165]  But roving teams of people shaking us down is not going to keep us safe.
[02:55:51.445 --> 02:55:52.145]  Absolutely not.
[02:55:52.906 --> 02:55:56.348]  What keeps us safe is all of us coming together and, you know, seeing past the illusion.
[02:55:56.529 --> 02:55:59.751]  I think the first thing you said at the start of the show was evergreen.
[02:56:00.649 --> 02:56:02.390]  They're doing all this because they know they're in trouble.
[02:56:02.991 --> 02:56:04.372]  Their system is falling apart.
[02:56:04.412 --> 02:56:05.653]  There is a paradigm shift.
[02:56:06.334 --> 02:56:12.658]  And right as they hit the big time, right as they get their world empire, it's already collapsing.
[02:56:12.799 --> 02:56:16.161]  As they finish their penultimate goal, it begins imploding.
[02:56:16.401 --> 02:56:20.064]  And that's why they start doing more and more drastic measures as it all comes together.
[02:56:20.104 --> 02:56:21.765]  Dean Hagelin, thank you for joining us.
[02:56:21.865 --> 02:56:22.966]  A joy as always.
[02:56:23.166 --> 02:56:23.827]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.847 --> 02:56:24.528]  See you back tomorrow.

[02:56:30.397 --> 02:56:30.537]  Hello!
