[00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:06.344]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:08.066]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:09.888]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:11.349]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.971]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.335]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:21.939]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.796]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:31.999]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.640]  It, of course, is
[00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:58.017]  Already Thursday, the 11th day of August, 2005, and we're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:10.308]  Of course, I was on Coast to Coast AM last night talking about all these different reports of suitcase nukes in the United States.
[00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:18.155]  It was a drill to be conducted in the next few days by the North American Military Command.
[00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:22.379]  Was that to be a cover for some type of real event?
[00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:28.525]  Why has this four-star general, number four in the Army,
[00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:33.774]  At the highest echelons of the military, been fired.
[00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:39.957]  The official story does not fit many of the facts.
[00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:51.442]  And on top of all of this, I've been to many urban warfare training drills with the police and military, trying to confiscate your guns, trying to put you in FEMA camps.
[00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:58.685]  And I've shot the footage, and I've documented it, and I've shown it, but always in the past,
[00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:05.499]  The local news and the national news would lie about it and say that it was for a foreign country.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.024]  I mean, you could walk right up and videotape the troops training for America and admitting it's for this country.
[00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:17.931]  But we have a newscast up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.553]  In fact, it's only on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:21.594]  It's just not going up there.
[00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:24.857]  I was doing a search for terror drills
[00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:53.563]  uh... this morning and uh... found this is actually several others and it's very similar to the Alabama Defense Force in other photos and videos we've gotten where they just set up random checkpoints, pull families out of vehicles, search children they're literal goons and uh... in this case up in Roanoke, Virginia it's Army, National Guard, State Guard, Police and they call the citizens rebels
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.582]  And they have cops playing the part against the other police and military as quote, the American Rebels.
[00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:05.183]  And it shows the police doing their mock sniping.
[00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:08.204]  The people protest and the cops shoot them.
[00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:12.485]  And they ride them down with horses and they billy club them.
[00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:16.306]  And they practice again taking over city buildings.
[00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:21.808]  So the government is training to stop civil insurrection.
[00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:28.706]  Now, why have they been doing this covertly for several decades, overtly in the last few years?
[00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:42.912]  What is it that they've got planned that is so horrible, that is so bad, that is so out of control, that they've got to gear up to do this?
[00:03:42.992 --> 00:03:46.113]  Now, you can go to InfoWars.com and watch the video.
[00:03:46.153 --> 00:03:50.235]  For some reason lately the computers at the network do not really work and do not download stuff.
[00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:50.815]  I don't know why.
[00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:55.525]  We have it all downloaded butchered, but I'm not going to air it butchered.
[00:03:56.226 --> 00:04:01.109]  Because there's one clip or bump in a piece of video off the web, people think I've edited it.
[00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.234]  So you can go right to my website, click over to their news website, and you can just watch it right there.
[00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:14.479]  I hope there will be clips in the future here on the show, but we're trying as hard as we can.
[00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:19.870]  You know, Thomas Watson era computers.
[00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.872]  You know, Thomas Watson, he invented, well he was the owner of IBM.
[00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:26.373]  Had the first computers back in the 40's.
[00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:28.254]  That's kind of what we have.
[00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:30.855]  We have the kind of computers that have the cards that come out of them.
[00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:33.136]  I'm joking folks, it's a joke.
[00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:35.337]  Just trying to have some fun.
[00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:38.539]  Because I'm really angry and upset about what's happening in this country.
[00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:41.720]  All the preparations for total martial law.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.821]  Been warning you about this for years.
[00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:45.582]  They've really been gearing up for it.
[00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:53.315]  We'll detail the nuclear drill, drills, and we'll also get into just the police state manifestations.
[00:04:54.056 --> 00:05:00.443]  Police chiefs up in Wisconsin publicly saying we shouldn't be able to own guns, the citizens can't be trusted, you name it, stay with us.
[00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:08.390]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.071]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:12.492]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:14.714]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:19.937]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.277 --> 00:05:24.300]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.322]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.402 --> 00:05:37.051]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.093]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:43.177]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.

[00:06:14.318 --> 00:06:18.981]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:26.168]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:38.339]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:04.496]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:05.076]  Why?

[00:08:02.117 --> 00:08:04.298]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.741]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.001]  Up in Wisconsin,
[00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:31.203]  The police chiefs had a big meeting on TV.
[00:08:31.223 --> 00:08:44.690]  The Association of Police Chiefs in W-V-A-Y, there in Green Bay, and there's a quote, police chiefs across Wisconsin say they need to keep all the guns they can in officers' hands only.
[00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:51.933]  And they're openly saying we cannot trust the citizens to have a concealed carry in Wisconsin.
[00:08:52.927 --> 00:09:07.117]  It doesn't matter that in Florida and Texas and a whole bunch of other states, on average, after three years of a concealed carry, the violent crime rate, the home invasion rate, drops around 22%.
[00:09:08.698 --> 00:09:11.139]  Now that's the average.
[00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:15.062]  In some areas, we've seen an 80-plus percent drop.
[00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.485]  There's big discrepancies here.
[00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:20.325]  You might have a 5%
[00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:28.184]  Or you might have an 82%, or in some cases even higher, but the average is around 22%.
[00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:38.170]  I've got Locke's book on it, the professor with all the statistics, and the feds even have to admit this, and I look at the crime statistics for the different states.
[00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:48.838]  I mean, obviously, Chicago, New York, LA, places with draconian gun control, Boston, they have the highest crime rates in the United States.
[00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:55.524]  England had very low crime rates, but when they banned all the guns, they still had guns until about 8 years ago.
[00:09:55.944 --> 00:10:00.465]  Their crime rate doubled the first year, doubled again, doubled again, and then planed off.
[00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:09.348]  Until now, even with the UN's own crime numbers, it is the second most dangerous country of the industrialized nations.
[00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:12.829]  Switzerland is number 15, the safest.
[00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:15.049]  America is number 14.
[00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.851]  Now, I'm sure you've heard America is the most dangerous and we have the most killings.
[00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:21.201]  And that's true.
[00:10:22.962 --> 00:10:23.882]  That is actually true.
[00:10:24.422 --> 00:10:32.485]  But for sheer muggings and home invasions and rapes and stabbings, England is number 2.
[00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:36.306]  Switzerland is number 15, the safest.
[00:10:37.126 --> 00:10:37.766]  The U.S.
[00:10:37.826 --> 00:10:41.107]  is number 14, overall crime is very low.
[00:10:42.087 --> 00:10:43.648]  But you see in statistics,
[00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:52.891]  They count gang members when they come in your house, or rapists when they come in your house, or gangs when they kill each other.
[00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.133]  They count that as gun violence and gun deaths.
[00:10:56.394 --> 00:11:05.401]  When cops shoot somebody on, you know, hopped up on methamphetamine, pulling a gun on them at a meth lab, that goes into those numbers.
[00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:13.127]  So only in the murder rate, or in the homicide rate, or in the death rate, are we numeral
[00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:14.364]  Uno.
[00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:20.389]  But with every other statistic, we are almost as safe as Switzerland.
[00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:29.378]  And what boosts our crime rate into the number 14 slot are cities like Chicago, New York, Detroit, areas like that.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.322]  Now, there is just so much I want to cover today.
[00:11:34.342 --> 00:11:36.805]  You know, I have this clip that we'll play later.
[00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:50.802]  Of Roanoke, Virginia, where the police and the military, regular military, National Guard, State Guard, call us rebels and terrorism is now protesting.
[00:11:51.662 --> 00:12:02.147]  They call them terrorists on the video and it shows crowds of cops and firemen and EMS workers as role players who are just waving signs and protesting.
[00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:19.807]  And the police and the military work together and it says that they shoot us and it shows the police doing mock sniper attacks on us and taking over the city buildings and this is what our government and our country trains to do.
[00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:25.991]  This is how they operate.
[00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:30.053]  This is the New World Order agenda.
[00:12:31.064 --> 00:12:34.925]  This is their program of control.
[00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:41.366]  And I've been screaming bloody murder about this for a long, long time.
[00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:49.628]  I mean, when you go to, say, Belton, Texas, just an hour north of me, you hear there's going to be an urban warfare drill.
[00:12:50.368 --> 00:12:56.889]  And they've got regular army there and state police and local police.
[00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.990]  And troops walk up to you
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:06.402]  In downtown Belton, good-sized town, and just say, turn the cameras off!
[00:13:06.442 --> 00:13:07.222]  What are you doing here?
[00:13:08.202 --> 00:13:10.003]  They think that it's the military's job.
[00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:19.226]  And we've got footage in Hebron, Maryland of them walking up and saying, you know, troops are training regular Marines to take over City Hall, openly for gun confiscations.
[00:13:19.246 --> 00:13:22.106]  They've got local 12- and 14-year-old kids.
[00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:23.847]  We have it all on video, training with them.
[00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:25.027]  But where are the guns?
[00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:25.628]  Go tell me.
[00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:28.488]  They're openly trying to get your kids to rat you out.
[00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:30.249]  This is Marine Corps training, folks.
[00:13:31.457 --> 00:13:32.157]  For America!
[00:13:32.737 --> 00:13:34.338]  They walk over and turn the camera off!
[00:13:34.778 --> 00:13:41.180]  And it's, you know, troops with a heavy machine gun behind them, and the local police in front of them.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.740]  What's your problem?
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.561]  Why are you videoing?
[00:13:43.581 --> 00:13:44.341]  This is America!
[00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:46.581]  This is one step away from Red Dawn!
[00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:49.682]  Literally stooping and bowing and showing them our papers.
[00:13:49.742 --> 00:13:51.603]  It's already happening on subways and buses.
[00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:56.364]  And these troops walk over, what are you doing with those cameras?
[00:13:56.384 --> 00:13:58.505]  Are you the guys that put us on TV last year?
[00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:00.779]  And we go, yeah, you bet we are.
[00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:01.780]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.221]  Yeah, you bet we are.
[00:14:03.302 --> 00:14:05.644]  We caught you running the checkpoints on those buses.
[00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:12.449]  The regular army would just pull over a bus, tell them it was real, and then later it came out it was a drill.
[00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.451]  It was real unsuspecting citizens.
[00:14:15.332 --> 00:14:16.052]  False arrest.
[00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:17.133]  I mean, this is mind control.
[00:14:17.854 --> 00:14:18.795]  Well, I don't like it.
[00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:20.116]  Well, I don't care if you don't like it.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.303]  And, uh, you know, you got the bomb squads and behind them the special forces types.
[00:14:25.704 --> 00:14:30.308]  Because the bomb squad guys have all got, you know, paunchy bellies and shirts hanging out.
[00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:31.649]  That's that type.
[00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:34.092]  You know, nice fellows, but still think this is Nazi Germany.
[00:14:34.372 --> 00:14:34.952]  Think they own us.
[00:14:34.972 --> 00:14:43.140]  And then the special forces types strutting around all, you know, with the big old square jaws, bowls in their eyes, uh, totally brainwashed.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.402]  Just totally brainwashed.
[00:14:45.422 --> 00:14:46.123]  And then all of a sudden,
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.520]  Boom!
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.281]  Boom!
[00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:49.481]  Cars explode.
[00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:51.562]  Fire shoots out 20 feet in the air.
[00:14:51.842 --> 00:14:53.103]  Helicopters swarming.
[00:14:54.043 --> 00:14:59.445]  They got the local kids from the high school training them how to be slaves on their summer vacation.
[00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:01.386]  Fake arms, fake blood.
[00:15:01.406 --> 00:15:03.327]  They're spilling it all over them.
[00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:05.668]  That's all in.
[00:15:05.848 --> 00:15:07.709]  And that's just one of these ops I've been to.
[00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:13.711]  But that's nothing compared to this video that we've got off this local newscast in Virginia.
[00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:24.968]  I mean, the horses riding the people down, the... I feel sorry for these cops that aren't in the riot gear and then they just let the troops beat them up.
[00:15:25.028 --> 00:15:32.952]  I mean, the troops actually tackle them and start stomping on them and you'll see a military officer get mad and shove one of the troops off of one of the cops.
[00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:34.913]  He's actually stomping on the cops.
[00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:41.082]  I mean, I guess at least they're in there getting the punishment they're trying to deal out to us.
[00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:48.570]  I mean, literally, horses running into people, troops jumping on cops, you know, cops in plain clothes, and firemen.
[00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:52.374]  They admit a lot of them are firemen in the drill.
[00:15:52.394 --> 00:15:54.796]  I don't know if a lot of cops would let you do that to them.
[00:15:54.836 --> 00:15:57.399]  It sounds like something firemen would do, because they're real men.
[00:16:00.262 --> 00:16:01.043]  I don't know, folks.
[00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:03.545]  It's just so scary.
[00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:04.625]  It's so un-American.
[00:16:04.886 --> 00:16:11.310]  I'm going to get into the nuclear grill while I was on Coast to Coast AM last night and some new developments, but let me just read this now.
[00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:13.852]  Let me just read this now.
[00:16:15.493 --> 00:16:26.762]  Federalized State Guard, National Guard, and Police train to dominate American citizens, take over local governments.
[00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:31.628]  Troops equate civil disturbances with terrorism.
[00:16:32.068 --> 00:16:33.749]  Citizens are called rebels.
[00:16:34.669 --> 00:16:37.271]  Now fighting terror means tackling people.
[00:16:37.891 --> 00:16:46.495]  They've taken the state guards and converted them into Stasi goon squads that engage in law enforcement activities across the country.
[00:16:47.096 --> 00:16:49.697]  Last year we reported on the Alabama Defense Force.
[00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:55.360]  We have links to that, which sets up random checkpoints and searches women and children in Alabama.
[00:16:57.071 --> 00:16:59.513]  The same system has been set up in Texas.
[00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:01.375]  We have their internal field manuals.
[00:17:01.935 --> 00:17:03.657]  Showed on TV in one of the weekly reports.
[00:17:04.418 --> 00:17:09.202]  It's all about gun confiscation, mass arrest, total control.
[00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:18.296]  Former Congressman Bob Barr has been all over national television warning the American people about current military recruiting that will put military on street corners.
[00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:37.841]  He asked, do we as a free people, with a notion of privacy enshrined in the Constitution, and based on the very clear limits and defined role of government, to be in a society where not just the police, but the military are on the street corners gathering intelligence on citizens sharing that data and manipulating that data?
[00:17:39.344 --> 00:17:54.052]  Meanwhile, the Washington Post is telling us how safe we will be because NORTHCOM, our new military overlords, are preparing to give us martial law to protect us from that evil concept formerly known as freedom, now known as Al Qaeda.
[00:17:55.253 --> 00:18:01.076]  And by the way, folks, each one of these statements is a link to where the mainstream news is.
[00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:02.136]  That's where we're different, folks.
[00:18:02.156 --> 00:18:02.997]  We document everything.
[00:18:03.763 --> 00:18:06.924]  Watch this disgusting clip of Roanoke, Virginia.
[00:18:07.304 --> 00:18:12.765]  Notice how they talk about fighting terror after 9-1-1 and that's civil disobedience.
[00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.806]  I guess fighting terror consists of dealing with rioters.
[00:18:16.446 --> 00:18:18.966]  Why does the government think we're going to be rioting?
[00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:26.108]  Why have they been quietly building giant force structures for the last eight years?
[00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:32.289]  The news piece points out police aiming their paintball guns at rebels and sniping them.
[00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.471]  I've been to ten of these grills in the last eight years in Belton, Texas.
[00:18:36.911 --> 00:18:44.273]  In 2000, we again had regular Army march up with the police and tell us to turn our cameras off.
[00:18:44.493 --> 00:18:48.174]  In 99, we were in Oakland, California covering Operation Urban Warrior.
[00:18:48.514 --> 00:18:54.916]  Thousands of active duty Marines trained openly with foreign troops to interrogate American citizens and confiscate our firearms.
[00:18:55.156 --> 00:18:56.756]  And by the way, break your families up.
[00:18:56.776 --> 00:18:57.576]  They take your kids.
[00:18:58.056 --> 00:18:59.497]  That video, you might want to watch it.
[00:18:59.657 --> 00:19:00.077]  Police State 2000.
[00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:08.151]  In Slonsboro, North Carolina, the Marines actually engage in live law enforcement activities, assisting at checkpoints in Hebron, Maryland.
[00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:13.378]  They practice taking over city halls and told our cameraman to turn his camera off.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.583]  All of this is
[00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:22.767]  Exhaustively detailed in my films, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, and 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:19:23.107 --> 00:19:24.368]  This is deadly serious.
[00:19:24.388 --> 00:19:25.589]  This is classical tyranny.
[00:19:25.869 --> 00:19:31.071]  They're turning America into an armed camp and treating us like slaves while leaving the borders wide open.
[00:19:33.892 --> 00:19:34.412]  All right.
[00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:43.276]  We'll be right back and get into the nuke drill scheduled to go on today or tomorrow throughout the next week.
[00:19:44.756 --> 00:19:48.320]  And how that ties into this four-star general who's over that base.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.923]  Number four in the Army being canned two days ago.
[00:19:51.943 --> 00:19:55.127]  And we'll take a lot of calls today.
[00:19:55.187 --> 00:19:56.088]  Wide open phones.
[00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:57.649]  Masses of news.
[00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:58.170]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.305 --> 00:20:05.347]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:20:05.587 --> 00:20:07.369]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[00:20:07.589 --> 00:20:11.231]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:20:11.532 --> 00:20:17.376]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:23.480]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.485]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:32.491]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:37.657]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[00:20:37.817 --> 00:20:40.200]  You can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.324]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[00:20:43.584 --> 00:20:46.805]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.

[00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:23.262]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:23.602 --> 00:21:29.305]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:36.210]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:43.235]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:43.515 --> 00:21:45.297]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.598]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[00:21:58.246 --> 00:22:05.349]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:11.173]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:11.633 --> 00:22:12.714]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:12.754 --> 00:22:16.756]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:30.764]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:31.265 --> 00:22:36.568]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:36.868 --> 00:22:42.752]  Whether you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.920]  And we do have that clip.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.561]  It's coming up.
[00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.261]  Very, very, very important.
[00:24:16.481 --> 00:24:18.082]  Out of Roanoke, Virginia.
[00:24:18.122 --> 00:24:19.502]  We'll play that in the next
[00:24:37.483 --> 00:24:45.488]  Next segment, four-star general fired for organizing coup against neocons, question mark.
[00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:55.275]  Reporters suggest that Byrnes discovered plan to turn nuke exercise into staged terror attack.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:08.448]  The head of Fort Monroe's Training and Doctrine Command, Four-Star General Kevin P. Burns, was fired Tuesday, apparently, for sexual misconduct, according to official sources.
[00:25:09.188 --> 00:25:24.658]  Other sources, however, have offered a different explanation for Burns' dismissal, which ties it with the Bush administration's unpopular plan to attack Iran and the staged nuclear attack in the U.S., which would provide the pretext to do so.
[00:25:25.509 --> 00:25:41.442]  According to reporter Greg Zeminski, the prolific writer, anonymous military sources said that Burns was the leader of a faction that was preparing to instigate a coup against the neocon hawks in an attempt to prevent further global conflict.
[00:25:42.182 --> 00:25:45.745]  I'd heard Burns' name, folks, a year ago in conjunction with this.
[00:25:46.506 --> 00:25:51.470]  That's why when I first heard about this it sent chills up my spine, something I needed to add there.
[00:25:52.148 --> 00:25:59.755]  Indications are that, much like popular opinion amongst the generals, half the military opposes the neocon's agenda, and half supports it.
[00:26:00.315 --> 00:26:05.840]  Further revelations were imparted by journalist Leland Lerman, who appeared on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:17.190]  Watson wrote this, Lerman's army sources, including a former captain in intelligence, became outraged when they learned the official story behind 9-11 was impossible.
[00:26:19.884 --> 00:26:37.419]  They told Lerman that the imminent NORTHCOM nuclear terror exercise based in Charlotte, South Carolina, where a nuclear warhead is to be smuggled off a ship and detonated, was originally intended to go live, as in the drill would be used as the cover for a real false flag attack.
[00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:45.545]  This website has relentlessly discussed similar style drills, which took place on the morning of 9-11 and on the morning of 7-7 in London.
[00:26:46.246 --> 00:26:48.608]  Speculation exists that he had
[00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:54.644]  Potentially discovered the fact that it was going to go live and that he was trying to put a stop to it.
[00:26:55.084 --> 00:27:05.310]  Or also, speculation indicates that he may be part of a military coup designed to prevent the ridiculous idea of doing a nuclear war with Iran, said Lerman.
[00:27:07.271 --> 00:27:11.133]  By the way, folks, I mean, those two stories fit together.
[00:27:12.093 --> 00:27:13.134]  Those two stories fit together.
[00:27:13.826 --> 00:27:15.087]  There's talk of coup.
[00:27:15.608 --> 00:27:17.229]  Well, why would they be talking about that?
[00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:19.331]  I mean, we know the globalists carry out 9-11.
[00:27:21.392 --> 00:27:25.155]  We know that they wanted one of those planes to go into the Capitol and decapitate the government.
[00:27:25.415 --> 00:27:26.096]  That was the plan.
[00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:30.620]  We know Jeb had already declared martial law two days before, covertly, in Florida.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.721]  We know Marvin ran security on the buildings.
[00:27:32.741 --> 00:27:35.584]  I mean, we know this was to be a coup d'etat.
[00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:40.668]  A decapitation of the government, leaving the President for total martial law.
[00:27:42.407 --> 00:27:45.168]  Now I got the Washington Post saying they're preparing for just that.
[00:27:45.248 --> 00:27:46.929]  Total martial law for your safety.
[00:27:46.989 --> 00:27:51.911]  We have all these articles where they're talking about it, saying Cheney's saying we're going to get nuked, Chertoff's saying it.
[00:27:52.311 --> 00:27:53.131]  I'm not saying it.
[00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:53.872]  They're saying it.
[00:27:54.352 --> 00:27:56.333]  And I never put dates on it like some people.
[00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:57.253]  Oh, it's going to happen on the 6th.
[00:27:57.393 --> 00:27:58.654]  It'll happen on the 9th.
[00:27:59.054 --> 00:28:01.275]  It may never happen because we're exposing it.
[00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:07.177]  But, uh, I think we are in real danger.
[00:28:07.197 --> 00:28:09.518]  You know, it's been four years since I've talked like this.
[00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:21.222]  Four years and roughly, what, 16 days ago, on July 25th, I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[00:28:22.563 --> 00:28:31.150]  And, uh, we said call the White House, tell them we know they're going to carry out a terror attack, but Lydon will take the blame as their CIA asset.
[00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:34.533]  Probably the World Trade Center will be it.
[00:28:35.994 --> 00:28:40.978]  And I'm not to the point of saying, you know, that I'm that sure on this, because this is a big deal.
[00:28:42.276 --> 00:28:52.043]  It's actually easier for the globalists to detonate a suitcase nuke or a frog that is an artillery nuclear munition.
[00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:55.426]  But at the same time, it's really going to be hard to manage.
[00:28:56.547 --> 00:29:01.150]  And they need to know that we're going to go along with them, that we're going to submit to them, that we're not going to resist.
[00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.235]  Because they know well and good that two million troops couldn't suppress two hundred and something million Americans.
[00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:09.779]  I mean, if we wake up, it's over.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.400]  And the troops are already waking up.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.500]  It's more than half of them.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.101]  So, uh, even foreign troops.
[00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:16.061]  You should bring them here.
[00:29:16.101 --> 00:29:23.324]  I mean, that will really... So, the globalists have gotten to this point, and they're set up to do it, but I think it's a contingency.
[00:29:23.424 --> 00:29:24.664]  I don't think it's written in stone.
[00:29:26.104 --> 00:29:32.766]  Alright, we'll tell you more about this, and we'll play that clip where the troops are training to literally kill you, and admitting it.
[00:29:32.806 --> 00:29:33.947]  You know, you're rebels.
[00:29:34.127 --> 00:29:37.548]  Yes, our military is training with the police to fight rebels.
[00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:42.426]  Now it's not terrorists or al-Qaeda, it's rebels.
[00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:44.947]  Why are they so worried about rebels?
[00:29:45.627 --> 00:29:46.627]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:55.010]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.611]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.315 --> 00:30:08.398]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedgie.
[00:30:08.898 --> 00:30:11.399]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:18.724]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[00:30:19.164 --> 00:30:27.229]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[00:30:27.609 --> 00:30:29.491]  Now all you have to do is go to their website.

[00:30:32.573 --> 00:30:36.396]  On the internet it is sacrowedgy.com.
[00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:41.780]  S-A-C-R-O-W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.521]  Sacrowedgy.com.
[00:30:43.982 --> 00:30:45.383]  Or you can use the toll free number.
[00:30:45.403 --> 00:30:45.703]  1-800-737-9295.
[00:30:45.723 --> 00:30:45.963]  That's 737-9295.
[00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:55.699]  Call them.
[00:30:55.739 --> 00:30:58.821]  It's only $29.95, and it really works.
[00:31:01.983 --> 00:31:05.545]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.585 --> 00:31:06.106]  are located?
[00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:09.688]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.908 --> 00:31:14.631]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:19.914]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.154 --> 00:31:26.178]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:39.146]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you
[00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:39.746]  I think so.
[00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:10.274]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:12.917]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:15.140]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.827]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.207 --> 00:32:25.489]  The T-Chain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:33.833]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:32:34.013 --> 00:32:41.097]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:32:41.617 --> 00:32:44.758]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:44.998 --> 00:32:47.459]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:49.059]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:54.040]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.601]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:56.721 --> 00:32:57.201]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:07.668]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:33:08.148 --> 00:33:10.910]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:14.753]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.833 --> 00:33:17.575]  A continuing receipt of a story of a four-star general.
[00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:20.538]  And the flames went higher, and it burned.
[00:33:20.678 --> 00:33:34.308]  Lerman said that other sources had told him all army leave had been cancelled from September 7th onwards, opening the possibility for war to be declared within that time frame.
[00:33:35.194 --> 00:33:44.619]  North Com officials also admitted to Lerman that CNN had been using its Situation Room as a studio for one of their new little propaganda programs.
[00:33:45.159 --> 00:33:59.367]  Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that the Pentagon has developed its first ever war plans for operations within the continental United States in which terrorist attacks would be used as justification for imposing martial law.
[00:33:59.407 --> 00:34:01.088]  They would use that term, but it's good, see?
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:08.083]  Articles tell you now that Big Brother's good, martial law is good, Black Mass are good, being surveilled is good.
[00:34:08.744 --> 00:34:11.765]  Again, imposing martial law on cities, regions, and the entire country.
[00:34:12.506 --> 00:34:25.653]  American Conservative Magazine recently reported that Dick Cheney had given orders to immediately invade Iran after the next terror attack if the U.S., even if there was no evidence Iran was involved.
[00:34:26.073 --> 00:34:27.074]  And that's public.
[00:34:28.094 --> 00:34:30.756]  The minute we get attacked, we invade them because the people will buy it then.
[00:34:31.573 --> 00:34:37.537]  Government and media mouthpieces have been fear-mongering for weeks about how a nuclear attack within the United States is imminent.
[00:34:38.817 --> 00:34:51.185]  Now will be the most opportune time for the globalists to stage a major terror attack as it would head off any potential indictments against the Bush administration for their involvement in illegally outing CIA agent Valerie Plain.
[00:34:51.745 --> 00:34:55.047]  While rumors circulating about the indictments have already taken place,
[00:34:55.735 --> 00:34:58.677]  Against Bush and Cheney should rightly be treated very carefully.
[00:34:59.298 --> 00:35:07.905]  The fact that there is an ongoing criminal investigation of the matter is something that's admitted and shouldn't be viewed as speculation.
[00:35:08.265 --> 00:35:10.287]  So that is a very real threat to this administration.
[00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:19.834]  Whether the indictments are real or not, there are several grand juries and panels investigating the Valerie Plame incident, namely the U.S.
[00:35:19.874 --> 00:35:23.677]  attorney and the grand jury up in Chicago.
[00:35:23.797 --> 00:35:24.698]  That is going on.
[00:35:25.464 --> 00:35:27.184]  So don't miss the forest for the trees.
[00:35:28.625 --> 00:35:30.185]  This is all happening right now.
[00:35:30.565 --> 00:35:34.306]  The approval ratings for the war are in the low 30s.
[00:35:34.526 --> 00:35:37.066]  Bush's job approval rating is in the mid-30s.
[00:35:38.346 --> 00:35:44.127]  And again, Bush is a puppet, but the globalists look at his approval rating as a benchmark for their agenda.
[00:35:45.948 --> 00:35:48.228]  And their whole program is in trouble.
[00:35:48.548 --> 00:35:50.768]  Their whole program is in deep trouble right now.
[00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:54.029]  And they want to go into Iran.
[00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:57.266]  They wanted to go in in August.
[00:35:57.446 --> 00:35:59.067]  Israel has said this.
[00:35:59.647 --> 00:36:01.769]  This has been in their major newspapers.
[00:36:02.469 --> 00:36:06.111]  Our government says they want to go into Iran.
[00:36:06.211 --> 00:36:10.154]  We've got special forces troops in the country right now.
[00:36:10.214 --> 00:36:10.914]  That's admitted.
[00:36:10.955 --> 00:36:16.258]  Seymour Hersh and even Time Magazine has reported on that, not just New Yorker Magazine.
[00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:19.180]  So all of this is already going on.
[00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.671]  And we have checked into it.
[00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:27.192]  Leaves are being cancelled for later this month.
[00:36:27.792 --> 00:36:32.274]  Now, that doesn't mean that there's going to be some type of war.
[00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:44.458]  Just because record numbers of ships are out of port and in the Gulf and in the Arabian Sea doesn't mean, and in the Mediterranean, in the Med, doesn't mean this is going to happen.
[00:36:45.278 --> 00:36:48.799]  Just by talking about it, I mean, being on coast to coast AM,
[00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:54.835]  You know, in their first hour of broadcast, they have 14 to 16 million listeners.
[00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:56.215]  I mean, that's the Arbitron, folks.
[00:36:56.455 --> 00:36:57.456]  There's a lot more than that.
[00:36:57.976 --> 00:37:04.417]  So last night, you know, potentially 14 million to 16 million people, you know, heard me talk about this.
[00:37:04.937 --> 00:37:07.098]  And we have millions of listeners on this broadcast.
[00:37:07.118 --> 00:37:19.220]  You know, we're on the radio in Chicago, we're on the radio in Kansas City, Austin, Texas, going into Los Angeles, you know, upstate New York, Florida, you know, Tennessee, just all over the place, growing.
[00:37:21.483 --> 00:37:25.948]  So we're reaching a lot of people right now.
[00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.452]  And that's always been our goal.
[00:37:29.532 --> 00:37:31.114]  Expose who's behind the terror.
[00:37:31.454 --> 00:37:33.356]  Expose who stands to gain from terror.
[00:37:33.897 --> 00:37:37.080]  Expose different scenarios before they even happen.
[00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:40.264]  And that doesn't even mean we're always right.
[00:37:40.856 --> 00:37:55.125]  You know, it's like we're on the DMZ, the Demilitarized Zone in Vietnam, or in World War I, all's quiet on the Western Front, and we're looking up over the embankment in the trenches at the enemy.
[00:37:55.605 --> 00:37:57.086]  And we're shooting up flares.
[00:37:57.146 --> 00:38:03.730]  We're trying to scan the topography, the terrain, for enemies crawling on their bellies.
[00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.431]  And we've caught them before, folks.
[00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:08.733]  Again, we caught them
[00:38:09.867 --> 00:38:11.949]  Before 9-11 on the record.
[00:38:12.489 --> 00:38:15.751]  And then day one engaged them on 9-11.
[00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:20.294]  And I said on the day of 9-11, that first hour of my show, I said it on Derry Brownfield.
[00:38:21.275 --> 00:38:26.219]  I said, we got a really good chance they're going to launch a bio-attack to continue the hysteria.
[00:38:26.319 --> 00:38:27.860]  I believe it's being launched right now.
[00:38:28.954 --> 00:38:31.015]  I have a lot of different indicators and sources on that.
[00:38:31.115 --> 00:38:34.576]  Sure enough, the White House mailed out anthrax to all their enemies.
[00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:36.177]  And it turned out it was a U.S.
[00:38:36.197 --> 00:38:39.678]  government program, and Bush was on Cipro, and the proof's in the pudding.
[00:38:39.698 --> 00:38:43.419]  Just go research it if you missed the past 50 shows I did on that, literally.
[00:38:46.441 --> 00:38:47.741]  So this is all going on.
[00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:49.382]  And this is happening.
[00:38:49.722 --> 00:38:52.983]  Meanwhile, just type into Google something like,
[00:38:54.076 --> 00:38:57.097]  Emergency officials participate in mock terror drill.
[00:38:57.537 --> 00:39:00.618]  Our police work with guard to fight terror.
[00:39:02.639 --> 00:39:15.244]  I talked in terror drill this morning because I wanted to track other drills they're doing, which desensitize the public, train the military and police to work together, and also begin to be used finally as covers when they really do it.
[00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:26.173]  That way, good people in government and in the NSA and other snooping arms that pick up chatter, think it's part of drills, part of turning up the background noise.
[00:39:26.733 --> 00:39:38.578]  It's like, you know, back in the 60s, the 50s, the Mafia learned that old-fashioned microphones could be defeated by turning on music, turning on the water, you know, in the sink, talking in the bathroom.
[00:39:39.838 --> 00:39:45.841]  Well, you know, high-tech systems can decipher and cut out the audio you want today, so that doesn't work.
[00:39:46.693 --> 00:39:59.556]  But, in the information, and in the zeros and ones being transmitted in the stratosphere, it's the equivalent of turning the water on, or of turning up the music, to have all these drills going on.
[00:40:00.956 --> 00:40:09.658]  And then, if your people get caught carrying out an op, oh they just tell the cop, oh no officer, or they just tell the NSA officer, or the CIA officer, oh no no, that was a drill!
[00:40:10.038 --> 00:40:12.778]  Yeah, oh these, these explosives I'm putting on these columns?
[00:40:14.419 --> 00:40:16.279]  Listen, your federal security detail
[00:40:16.969 --> 00:40:17.950]  Here in Building 70.
[00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.331]  You just go on down the hall.
[00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:20.051]  This is a drill.
[00:40:20.552 --> 00:40:21.913]  You can go ask the supervisor.
[00:40:22.933 --> 00:40:28.417]  And then of course, uh, they get on the radio and, uh, yeah, his, uh, tag number.
[00:40:28.457 --> 00:40:30.258]  He's, uh, John, Johnson Doe.
[00:40:30.398 --> 00:40:30.699]  Yeah.
[00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:31.920]  Uh-huh.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.260]  Uh-huh.
[00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:34.321]  He's gonna, yeah.
[00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:34.762]  Mm-hmm.
[00:40:35.702 --> 00:40:35.822]  Oh.
[00:40:36.623 --> 00:40:37.183]  Car wreck?
[00:40:37.263 --> 00:40:37.483]  Sure.
[00:40:38.164 --> 00:40:41.046]  And Mr. Doe dies the next day in a car wreck.
[00:40:41.983 --> 00:40:42.463]  Real sad.
[00:40:42.844 --> 00:40:44.845]  Now the car runs over him and backs back over him.
[00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:48.468]  That way he doesn't panic and freak out right then and get cops involved.
[00:40:48.768 --> 00:40:51.610]  Then you have an investigation that blows the whole operation.
[00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.852]  And then they wouldn't kill the Federal Security Guard.
[00:40:55.373 --> 00:40:56.213]  We know about some of those.
[00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:58.014]  We're not at liberty to talk about them.
[00:40:58.715 --> 00:41:00.596]  These guys catch them planting bombs.
[00:41:00.616 --> 00:41:02.798]  They catch them running operations where people are in the...
[00:41:03.402 --> 00:41:12.647]  You know, in the op, when they're remote, you can have somebody remote-controlling planes right next to somebody else thinking they're taking part in a drill on a terminal on a screen right next to them.
[00:41:12.968 --> 00:41:16.289]  That's how these drills and compartmentalization works.
[00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:25.255]  And as everything goes mechanized, as everything becomes remote-controlled, half the Air Force will be drone in O-10, five years away.
[00:41:25.275 --> 00:41:29.337]  A third of the ground forces will be robotic, remote-controlled.
[00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:38.317]  By 2011, 76 billion going to be spent in the next 10 years on robotic forces for the ground alone.
[00:41:38.878 --> 00:41:43.022]  That means pre-programmed battle plans can be launched.
[00:41:44.083 --> 00:41:46.005]  Especially, you think in 5 years it will be bad.
[00:41:46.265 --> 00:41:46.946]  Imagine 10, 15.
[00:41:47.607 --> 00:41:49.989]  Look how technology has grown so far.
[00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:53.973]  You're going to have most of the military being pre-programmed and being robotic.
[00:41:55.101 --> 00:42:03.486]  Uh, being, uh, you know, mechanized tanks, mechanized ground vehicles, mechanized, uh, swords, as they're called, but much more advanced than what they have now.
[00:42:03.506 --> 00:42:09.971]  Uh, I've been, well, I can't really get into a lot of stuff.
[00:42:11.167 --> 00:42:18.613]  Become aware of is, I can't even talk about it on air, but they have what they call combat mechs that are so advanced, folks, it's science fiction.
[00:42:19.074 --> 00:42:24.879]  But just the stuff we're being shown is really, really bad.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:32.145]  But see, that allows the elite, if the soldiers and the troops and the police don't follow orders, well they just hit a button.
[00:42:33.226 --> 00:42:38.170]  And, you know, in every city they're planning to have hundreds, and this was
[00:42:39.386 --> 00:42:48.012]  You know, just in the next decade or so, hundreds of literal pre-programmed, and they're not artificially intelligent, they're just pre-programmed.
[00:42:49.033 --> 00:43:06.985]  And they even, with the Swords, just one of the different types of robots being used, being tested in combat, over in Iraq, they send in, say, 20 of these Swords with rocket launchers and machine guns, and the troops are wearing bracelets with a RFID tag.
[00:43:07.808 --> 00:43:08.669]  And the S.W.O.R.D.
[00:43:08.789 --> 00:43:09.309]  pings it.
[00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:12.612]  So there's S.W.O.R.D.s out there with our troops in combat.
[00:43:13.112 --> 00:43:14.854]  And the S.W.O.R.D.s rolling down the street.
[00:43:15.274 --> 00:43:16.215]  It draws fire.
[00:43:16.535 --> 00:43:17.996]  It's got cameras around corners.
[00:43:18.057 --> 00:43:19.238]  It starts firing at enemies.
[00:43:19.618 --> 00:43:20.278]  But the S.W.O.R.D.
[00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:24.702]  won't fire if he pings that radio tag and it's not one of the troops.
[00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:35.891]  Well, in the future, and this is admitted, if you don't have a card that's in function, a card that says you're good, and by the way, under federal law, Real ID, we're all going to have tracker chips in our driver's license now.
[00:43:35.931 --> 00:43:36.692]  That's now happening.
[00:43:37.873 --> 00:43:40.255]  It'll be implemented nationwide by federal law by 2008.
[00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:41.895]  Already a lot of states already have it.
[00:43:42.696 --> 00:43:45.938]  I'm sure you heard folks coming in from Canada or Mexico now.
[00:43:46.398 --> 00:43:47.679]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[00:43:47.699 --> 00:43:50.681]  You've got to carry a chip with you or you're arrested.
[00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:52.522]  And that thing can be read from hundreds of feet.
[00:43:53.042 --> 00:43:55.204]  They're trying to put chips in all inspection stickers.
[00:43:55.584 --> 00:43:57.325]  Almost passed that in Texas this year.
[00:43:58.538 --> 00:44:04.480]  To quote, tax you, and to make sure your quote, insurance is up to date, but also it will be used for this.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.000]  The military even admits it.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.881]  We've read the reports on air.
[00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:10.542]  This whole grid is multi-use.
[00:44:11.342 --> 00:44:16.423]  And so they just turn loose a couple thousand of these babies in your city, and they go around killing everybody.
[00:44:17.183 --> 00:44:19.144]  Now, folks, this is not a joke.
[00:44:20.504 --> 00:44:20.864]  Okay?
[00:44:21.605 --> 00:44:22.385]  This is not a joke.
[00:44:22.425 --> 00:44:26.086]  You don't have the proper RFID tag, that robot is going to kill you.
[00:44:26.795 --> 00:44:28.396]  And they've got them with nerve gas.
[00:44:28.496 --> 00:44:30.337]  They've got them that deploy bio-weapons.
[00:44:31.098 --> 00:44:32.378]  That's really super secret.
[00:44:33.299 --> 00:44:41.444]  They've got, but mainly, also when you think of a robot, imagine something the size of a Ford pickup truck.
[00:44:42.504 --> 00:44:43.765]  And it's got treads.
[00:44:44.505 --> 00:44:47.187]  And under it it's got little wheels in case a tread gets stuck.
[00:44:47.887 --> 00:44:48.808]  Retractable wheels.
[00:44:48.868 --> 00:44:52.070]  This was in the Honolulu Advertiser two years ago.
[00:44:52.856 --> 00:45:04.819]  And it showed the military, with police doing a drill, and there's like 20 cops and military firing machine guns, with their shields up, firing machine guns at this combat robot.
[00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:10.220]  And this thing looks like a snub-nosed Ford pickup truck, but it's all contained.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.481]  And it looked like a joke.
[00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:17.562]  It had, like, pepper spray canisters, rubber bullets, machine guns, cannons.
[00:45:18.122 --> 00:45:21.563]  It's got everything from electrical prods it shoots at you,
[00:45:22.626 --> 00:45:26.428]  On the non-lethal, or less lethal, up to cannons.
[00:45:28.449 --> 00:45:28.809]  Okay?
[00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.531]  And, uh, so, I mean, those are already deployed.
[00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:33.912]  Those are already ready.
[00:45:34.092 --> 00:45:36.013]  They got them with microwave guns, you name it.
[00:45:36.693 --> 00:45:37.994]  Sound cannons, you name it.
[00:45:39.255 --> 00:45:41.736]  And, uh, so really all it is is some zip-faced kid
[00:45:42.398 --> 00:45:48.481]  You know, he's been hired by the military and he can be at Fort Hood in a combat game simulation pod.
[00:45:48.501 --> 00:45:52.263]  I mean, he likes to play games 50 hours, you know, until he has a heart attack anyways.
[00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:53.663]  That just happened in South Korea.
[00:45:53.963 --> 00:45:57.305]  I played for 51 hours and had a heart attack and died at 27 years old.
[00:45:58.666 --> 00:46:01.467]  I mean, there's adults that will play 20 hours in a row that I know.
[00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:07.454]  I know successful businessmen that are getting divorces so they can spend more time with their video games.
[00:46:07.874 --> 00:46:10.836]  They don't even, now that they're divorced, want to go date women.
[00:46:11.096 --> 00:46:12.397]  They just want to play their video games.
[00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:18.322]  And as they get realer and realer and realer, now they're having simulations of pain, simulated pain it sends you.
[00:46:18.562 --> 00:46:20.283]  Well, the military admits that's the plan.
[00:46:20.643 --> 00:46:22.264]  So you're going to have pods of these guys.
[00:46:22.284 --> 00:46:23.025]  In fact, you already do.
[00:46:23.085 --> 00:46:25.266]  Guiding cruise missiles and guiding drones.
[00:46:25.286 --> 00:46:26.227]  They're called controllers.
[00:46:27.328 --> 00:46:28.769]  And they're just going to be in there.
[00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:30.090]  And it even simulates it
[00:46:30.945 --> 00:46:33.226]  So you don't actually see the person physically.
[00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:41.512]  It shows you your subjects that you're killing in different spectrums.
[00:46:42.652 --> 00:46:45.634]  It shows you who you're killing in infrared.
[00:46:45.674 --> 00:46:48.696]  It shows them to you in ground penetrating radar.
[00:46:49.497 --> 00:46:54.860]  It shows them to you in a bunch of different other wavelengths.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:23.509]  And so all you see is a heat signature behind a wall, and you're just rampaging tanks, and your tank gets blown up, well, you just hit a button, wait for a drop ship, you wait 20 minutes, get some coffee, get back in the pod, a drone robot tiltwing aircraft lands, it drops off four more combat tanks, and you're back in the pod, just slaughtering and murdering and killing.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.501]  But what's even more, you know, taking out of the equation, always having to face your enemy.
[00:47:29.922 --> 00:47:32.142]  Always having to deal with children you've killed.
[00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:34.723]  Always having to deal with what war really is.
[00:47:35.123 --> 00:47:41.165]  Now there's that disconnect with people who've been playing video games for 20 years and have simulated a million killings.
[00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:42.963]  More than a million killings.
[00:47:43.224 --> 00:47:45.824]  Per session, you may simulate thousands of killings.
[00:47:46.065 --> 00:47:46.945]  Ripping guts out.
[00:47:47.065 --> 00:47:47.865]  Raping women.
[00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:49.386]  Raping people.
[00:47:49.426 --> 00:47:50.346]  Getting bonus points.
[00:47:50.646 --> 00:47:51.807]  Running over old women.
[00:47:51.907 --> 00:47:53.367]  Spinning out on their intestines.
[00:47:53.647 --> 00:47:55.628]  Get you double cash.
[00:47:55.688 --> 00:47:57.689]  You're UN forces who have microchips.
[00:47:57.709 --> 00:47:59.810]  You kill and torture militia members.
[00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.990]  You know, do sex.
[00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.191]  These are the games, folks.
[00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:06.592]  And this will allow the elite to control everything.
[00:48:07.873 --> 00:48:17.178]  This will allow the elite, very soon they won't even need the individuals who are in the combat pods within 10-15 years.
[00:48:17.918 --> 00:48:18.978]  That won't even be needed.
[00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:32.325]  They're actually using, by the way, all the hundreds of millions and billions of moves that are made now to the Xbox, and I know people internally who worked on the Xbox, and believe me folks, it's Department of Defense,
[00:48:33.175 --> 00:48:37.157]  And it stores all the data of every move you've made, what you've done.
[00:48:37.737 --> 00:48:46.582]  All of your human traits and skills that you put into that are being looked at by Cray Super Mainframes.
[00:48:46.822 --> 00:48:53.966]  And they're going to teach all those fighter pilot moves, all of those tank moves, everything to the computers.
[00:48:55.226 --> 00:48:58.028]  Which already, in most cases, are already better than most human players.
[00:48:59.185 --> 00:49:05.189]  And so actually the computers are war gaming against millions of people right now.
[00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:08.591]  These are live war games to train the computers.
[00:49:09.672 --> 00:49:12.794]  So I say ten years, it's going to be sooner than that.
[00:49:13.034 --> 00:49:22.280]  So a globalist hits one button and has thousands of fighters, thousands of helicopters, thousands of drones, thousands of combat mech robots trained.
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.202]  They hit a button and they can release them.
[00:49:26.525 --> 00:49:28.025]  The warehouses are automated.
[00:49:28.286 --> 00:49:29.886]  The fueling systems are automated.
[00:49:30.266 --> 00:49:31.186]  Everything's automated.
[00:49:31.346 --> 00:49:32.207]  Everything's controlled.
[00:49:32.387 --> 00:49:33.747]  They're not even going to need you.
[00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:38.228]  SWAT team, Mr. Tough Guys, you're obsolete in just a few years.
[00:49:39.449 --> 00:49:42.429]  Fighter pilots, you're already being told you're not going to have a job.
[00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:43.130]  It's over.
[00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.210]  You're going to be fueling those aircraft.
[00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:46.711]  That's it.
[00:49:48.631 --> 00:49:49.952]  So you want to look at the future.
[00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:51.412]  I've got to write an essay on this.
[00:49:51.432 --> 00:49:55.193]  There's so many essays on what's developing that I need to write.
[00:49:55.925 --> 00:50:04.269]  I mean, I had five minutes this morning and I wrote this article about the troops trying to put us in camps and take our guns and calling us rebels.
[00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:10.532]  And we're going to play that coming up in a few minutes, but I just don't have time.
[00:50:12.213 --> 00:50:20.878]  And I'm not whining about it, but I mean, frankly, some of the other Patriot Talk Show hosts and other freedom lovers need to get on the ball and really get the big picture.
[00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:21.418]  They don't.
[00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:33.205]  They're either talking about how it's all a communist conspiracy, or how it's all a Jewish conspiracy, or how it's all a Catholic conspiracy, or how it's all a... No, it's evil people!
[00:50:33.705 --> 00:50:40.010]  And the globalists control communism, they control Zionism, they control Nazism, they control radical Islamism, they control it all!
[00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:47.074]  And you guys need to start talking about the control grid, the system going in, the battle plan.
[00:50:48.935 --> 00:50:51.257]  You understand right now, the computers are war gaming.
[00:50:52.063 --> 00:50:54.067]  Against millions of people worldwide.
[00:50:54.768 --> 00:50:56.190]  They're getting so smart, folks.
[00:50:56.751 --> 00:50:57.332]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:05.822]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.082 --> 00:51:07.662]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:22.027]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.267 --> 00:51:25.110]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:29.874]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[00:54:11.377 --> 00:54:24.223]  Look, I know you haven't gotten your calls yet, but for all the Billy Bad Behinds out there, the SWAT team guys, you know, the tough guys, listen, I've read the Army reports, we've posted them.
[00:54:24.583 --> 00:54:26.424]  You're not going to have guns, you understand?
[00:54:26.444 --> 00:54:27.384]  You're not going to do anything.
[00:54:27.404 --> 00:54:30.245]  You're going to be like a toilet attendant walking around with a taser.
[00:54:30.946 --> 00:54:34.307]  That's why they're getting you all to take tasers right now, because they're going to take your guns away.
[00:54:35.728 --> 00:54:40.750]  And, uh, you're at most going to be managing robots.
[00:54:41.733 --> 00:54:44.014]  Managing, you know, remote control devices.
[00:54:46.356 --> 00:54:47.737]  And I just hope you enjoy it.
[00:54:48.357 --> 00:54:51.799]  And I hope that you enjoy the oppression.
[00:54:51.819 --> 00:54:54.160]  I mean, I hope you enjoy it all.
[00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:57.202]  And I hope that the military enjoys all this.
[00:54:59.063 --> 00:55:05.127]  It's just, you know, we ought to have treaties not to develop these weapons and not have this arms race.
[00:55:06.487 --> 00:55:09.069]  But everybody's going to develop their own robotic forces.
[00:55:10.723 --> 00:55:12.485]  And it really is the Terminator scenario.
[00:55:14.948 --> 00:55:17.191]  But it's not going to be, I don't think, the machines turning against us.
[00:55:17.392 --> 00:55:22.678]  It's going to be globalists who are totally psychopathic in control of these devices.
[00:55:24.581 --> 00:55:27.084]  And everything is going to be radio frequency read and scanned.
[00:55:27.584 --> 00:55:29.507]  These robots are going to have your face scanned.
[00:55:30.539 --> 00:55:37.720]  Imprinted on them and actually was in the Japan, Tokyo Times, it was in a bunch of newspapers a couple months ago.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:42.161]  But they actually are now having robots at the shopping malls running security.
[00:55:43.321 --> 00:55:48.142]  And they will physically try to block you if the buzzers go off.
[00:55:48.522 --> 00:55:50.302]  There are two robots at the door.
[00:55:50.562 --> 00:55:51.803]  I forgot about this.
[00:55:52.423 --> 00:55:54.183]  And the robots grab you.
[00:55:55.863 --> 00:55:58.044]  And they look like robots out of THX 1138.
[00:56:01.707 --> 00:56:03.508]  They're, uh, they're pretty scary.
[00:56:05.188 --> 00:56:08.569]  And again, robots, folks!
[00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.569]  2005!
[00:56:08.609 --> 00:56:08.849]  It's 2005!
[00:56:08.909 --> 00:56:15.152]  They tell you the fastest plane is the SR-71 Blackbird, in flight in 1955, in service, front line, surveillance in 1959.
[00:56:15.192 --> 00:56:16.572]  Do you believe that 48 years later,
[00:56:32.044 --> 00:56:35.627]  47 years later, do you really think it's still the fastest plane in the world?
[00:56:36.147 --> 00:56:38.649]  Cruising at Mach 3, top speeds at Mach 4, Mach 5.
[00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.452]  Do you really believe that, folks?
[00:56:41.472 --> 00:56:48.477]  Do you really believe that... Well, they admit the B-2 bomber was around 15 years before they announced it in 1987.
[00:56:51.139 --> 00:56:52.800]  At the Skunk Works at Lockheed Martin.
[00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:55.042]  Do you believe any of the stuff you're fed?
[00:56:55.162 --> 00:56:56.623]  I mean, come on, stop being stupid!
[00:56:57.544 --> 00:56:58.985]  They admit all these robots now!
[00:56:59.045 --> 00:56:59.566]  I mean, okay!
[00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:06.156]  Okay, I'm going to come back, I'm going to get more into the... Are they going to nuke us?
[00:57:06.236 --> 00:57:07.137]  Is a nuke going to go off?
[00:57:07.197 --> 00:57:08.457]  Why was this general fired?
[00:57:09.397 --> 00:57:17.720]  I've got not just these reporters, but other people, and other people in the Pentagon, people at Fort Hood, saying, you know, watch this drill.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.860]  I was hearing this a month ago.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:20.041]  We'll talk about it.
[00:57:21.361 --> 00:57:30.784]  Before we end this hour, though, and come back and take your calls and get back in all the news, and play this audio clip of the military, before we do this, in the last minute of this hour,
[00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:34.238]  We need your support to fight the New World Order.
[00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:35.398]  That's secondary, though.
[00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:37.460]  My videos are powerful.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.201]  They're waking people up.
[00:57:39.742 --> 00:57:40.362]  They're long.
[00:57:40.402 --> 00:57:41.083]  They're jam-packed.
[00:57:41.103 --> 00:57:42.124]  They're multiple films.
[00:57:42.744 --> 00:57:44.986]  Road to Tyranny is really three films in one.
[00:57:45.006 --> 00:57:45.766]  170 minutes long.
[00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:49.509]  Martial Law, my newest film, is even longer.
[00:57:49.729 --> 00:57:51.651]  It's a little over three hours, three films.
[00:57:51.991 --> 00:57:55.574]  What happened on 9-11, the latest police state developments, and Who the Globalist Are.
[00:57:56.528 --> 00:57:57.769]  You need to have martial law.
[00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:01.693]  You need to have American dictators to expose the phony left-right paradigm.
[00:58:02.134 --> 00:58:04.716]  You need to have these videos and get them out to people.
[00:58:05.177 --> 00:58:10.342]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:58:27.522 --> 00:58:28.243]  Do not wait.
[00:58:28.363 --> 00:58:29.963]  Expose who's behind the terror.
[00:58:30.343 --> 00:58:32.344]  They lose the power that terror gives them.
[00:58:32.804 --> 00:58:33.544]  Then they stop doing it.
[00:58:34.204 --> 00:58:37.585]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch it all online right now.
[00:58:37.625 --> 00:58:38.185]  Stay with us.

[00:58:45.977 --> 00:58:46.218]  Hello?
[00:58:46.258 --> 00:58:46.678]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.838 --> 00:58:47.459]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.619 --> 00:58:52.123]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.384 --> 00:58:56.026]  You want answers?
[00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.307]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.076 --> 00:59:10.059]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.259 --> 00:59:14.382]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.627 --> 00:59:26.130]  Alright, wide open phones in the shower.
[00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.072]  Last hour we talked about no martial law, living in the police state.
[00:59:31.113 --> 00:59:34.135]  We've got an incredible clip coming up, and in the next segment I will play it.
[00:59:34.853 --> 00:59:39.875]  Uh, Roanoke, Virginia, where, well, the military openly trains to, uh, kill rebels.
[00:59:39.955 --> 00:59:40.515]  That's us.
[00:59:42.096 --> 00:59:42.996]  With local police.
[00:59:43.917 --> 00:59:46.058]  They're not saying it's for Iraq anymore, folks.
[00:59:46.078 --> 00:59:49.119]  See, they gotta announce it now, because they're getting ready to want to use it.
[00:59:49.139 --> 00:59:50.520]  They've been, for decades, training.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:58.403]  And we'll get into this, uh, you know, these reports of, was this general, this four-star general, number four in the army overall, fourth in command,
[00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:04.630]  A commanding general, Kevin P. Burns, was he fired for not wanting to go along with martial law?
[01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:10.192]  Was he fired for not wanting to go along with some type of drill that was supposed to go live with nukes?
[01:00:10.212 --> 01:00:17.674]  This has been being reported by multiple sources, and now I've been getting it from sources inside the government, that it could be the case.
[01:00:18.134 --> 01:00:18.754]  We'll talk about it.
[01:00:19.174 --> 01:00:22.575]  Patty in South Carolina, and then Mo and everybody else.
[01:00:22.615 --> 01:00:23.276]  Go ahead, Patty.
[01:00:23.716 --> 01:00:24.496]  Oh, hey Alex.
[01:00:25.157 --> 01:00:30.121]  Listen, on Coast to Coast, about two weeks ago on Open Lines, I called George Norrie.
[01:00:31.102 --> 01:00:36.566]  You know how the Lone Gunman episode came out about the planes hitting the buildings before 9-11?
[01:00:36.927 --> 01:00:37.327]  Yes.
[01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:43.072]  Well, in the mid-1980s, there was a made-for-TV movie called Special Report.
[01:00:43.112 --> 01:00:52.019]  It was sort of like a World to World type thing, where they actually set off a nuclear device at a port in Charleston, South Carolina.
[01:00:54.338 --> 01:01:01.481]  Well, they had a 1976 Army drill of men with box cutters taking over two planes and flying them into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[01:01:03.982 --> 01:01:14.607]  And so, listen, I have Associated Press articles where they pay $44 million a year, the Pentagon does, just for script writers to write them terrorist scenarios.
[01:01:15.807 --> 01:01:17.108]  And they won't say why.
[01:01:17.128 --> 01:01:19.869]  Well, because they actually need a script to follow.
[01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:26.272]  I remember thinking at the time, I don't remember that much about the movie when it came out.
[01:01:26.312 --> 01:01:28.333]  I remember thinking, you know, Charleston of all places.
[01:01:29.614 --> 01:01:33.776]  And then now they're having a drill where Charleston gets bombed by a nuke.
[01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:37.579]  Yeah, and then the bomb did go off in the movie, I do want you to know that.
[01:01:38.379 --> 01:01:45.044]  But did you know Charleston is on the 33rd parallel and it's also where Albert Pike started the 33rd degree of Freemasonry?
[01:01:45.704 --> 01:01:49.607]  I did know that and the Globalist really ended up doing things on those meridians.
[01:01:52.203 --> 01:01:54.165]  I just wanted to let you know that about the movie.
[01:01:54.505 --> 01:01:56.046]  I didn't know if you had heard about it.
[01:01:56.167 --> 01:01:57.568]  I didn't know that.
[01:01:57.708 --> 01:01:58.629]  Special report.
[01:01:58.649 --> 01:01:59.309]  Send me a copy.
[01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:01.051]  I don't have a copy of it.
[01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:01.851]  I wish I did.
[01:02:02.372 --> 01:02:03.152]  Good to hear from you.
[01:02:04.173 --> 01:02:04.934]  Take care, Patty.
[01:02:04.974 --> 01:02:05.594]  God bless you.
[01:02:06.015 --> 01:02:06.976]  Moe in Texas.
[01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:07.856]  Moe, you're on the air.
[01:02:07.896 --> 01:02:08.297]  Go ahead.
[01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.060]  Moe is gone.
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.982]  Well, let's talk to... Who's next in line?
[01:02:15.823 --> 01:02:16.744]  Jamie in Kentucky.
[01:02:16.784 --> 01:02:17.364]  Go ahead, Jamie.
[01:02:17.564 --> 01:02:18.125]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:19.101 --> 01:02:22.303]  Uh, about this movie special report.
[01:02:22.783 --> 01:02:24.984]  I'm going to research it and try to find it.
[01:02:25.844 --> 01:02:28.265]  I'll try to, uh, you know.
[01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:30.646]  Sounds like you've got a parade going in the background.
[01:02:31.367 --> 01:02:34.708]  Oh, we're watching All My Children.
[01:02:34.728 --> 01:02:37.830]  Call into the show while you're watching the soap opera.
[01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:38.390]  That's good.
[01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:39.931]  My grandmother's watching it.
[01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:40.611]  That's okay.
[01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:41.331]  I'm just teasing you.
[01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:41.811]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:56.091]  You said, you know, that you don't have the budget to work people right there and stuff, but in a way, we're working for you when we call in.
[01:02:56.111 --> 01:02:57.152]  We're correspondents.
[01:02:58.232 --> 01:03:03.934]  Well you are, and listeners send me news articles, they send me video, you guys do a great job.
[01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:10.737]  Yeah, and also that, have you ever heard, I got this video, it's about Pike and them,
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.001]  Uh, Darwin and stuff.
[01:03:16.701 --> 01:03:22.803]  And it says that we don't need a social security card or driver's license.
[01:03:22.983 --> 01:03:24.644]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:03:24.964 --> 01:03:28.665]  Well, it is unconstitutional, but they're setting it up where you go to a FEMA camp if you don't take it.
[01:03:28.685 --> 01:03:29.606]  Because that's freedom.
[01:03:29.646 --> 01:03:30.746]  That's what freedom is.
[01:03:30.866 --> 01:03:31.486]  Thanks for the call.

[01:06:58.485 --> 01:06:59.125]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.785 --> 01:07:00.865]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.546 --> 01:07:02.666]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.326 --> 01:07:04.146]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:05.967]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.267 --> 01:07:10.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.628 --> 01:07:14.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:19.391]  I know you don't want to hear it, but I'm going to say it.
[01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:23.312]  Stop using cell phones without a wireless system.
[01:07:23.352 --> 01:07:25.073]  Stop putting them up against your head.
[01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:29.457]  Hundreds of studies show it's causing massive brain tumors.
[01:07:30.658 --> 01:07:34.240]  It is causing massive problems in the eye itself.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.502]  It is microwaving your eye.
[01:07:36.522 --> 01:07:38.523]  It is microwaving your brain.
[01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:41.405]  But your eyes are not shielded by the skull.
[01:07:41.866 --> 01:07:45.108]  A lot of the microwave radiation bounces off or doesn't penetrate.
[01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:47.390]  Some does, and you get brain tumors.
[01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.832]  But it really fries your eye.
[01:07:49.972 --> 01:07:55.576]  It's conclusive of a bunch of major scientific studies by governments, by universities, by private firms.
[01:07:57.285 --> 01:07:59.086]  Stop smoking cigarettes, folks.
[01:07:59.267 --> 01:08:03.270]  I mean, I've smoked and then quit for five years and smoked again.
[01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:04.571]  I'll never smoke again.
[01:08:05.091 --> 01:08:06.332]  What is wrong with us?
[01:08:07.073 --> 01:08:08.834]  Stop drinking tap water.
[01:08:09.715 --> 01:08:13.077]  I mean, a lot of studies show worse than smoking cigarettes, folks.
[01:08:13.598 --> 01:08:21.604]  It is full of herbicides and pesticides and heavy metals and dead bacteria and just so much that you don't want to be drinking.
[01:08:22.624 --> 01:08:25.787]  And I just say that because those are things we can do that
[01:08:27.037 --> 01:08:29.259]  You know, so we're going to be there longer for our children.
[01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.960]  We're going to be there longer for our communities.
[01:08:31.321 --> 01:08:33.342]  We're not going to fall into the traps of the New World Order.
[01:08:33.623 --> 01:08:35.884]  Listen, the globalists only eat organic food.
[01:08:35.925 --> 01:08:37.346]  They're really into organic food.
[01:08:37.726 --> 01:08:39.708]  You don't see them holding cell phones up to their heads.
[01:08:40.008 --> 01:08:43.691]  You don't see them drinking Diet Coke full of aspartame, deadly wood alcohol.
[01:08:45.112 --> 01:08:46.513]  You don't see them doing that.
[01:08:47.114 --> 01:08:48.415]  They're really into being healthy.
[01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:49.436]  You should be too.
[01:08:50.558 --> 01:08:54.421]  Alright, in the last hour I read this report that I threw together this morning.
[01:08:55.061 --> 01:09:02.426]  Federalized State Guard, National Guard, and Police trained to dominate American citizens, take over local governments.
[01:09:03.787 --> 01:09:07.730]  You can watch the video of this at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:08.971]  It's not up on Prison Planet yet.
[01:09:10.031 --> 01:09:11.933]  Off the local newscast, we have a link to it.
[01:09:12.073 --> 01:09:16.416]  Roanoke emergency officials participate in mock terror drill.
[01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:20.272]  We've also Google kind of cached it.
[01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:21.333]  We do kind of like what Google does.
[01:09:21.373 --> 01:09:23.554]  We save stuff just to back it up, archive it.
[01:09:24.034 --> 01:09:26.596]  Whether it's terrorism, riots, or any major disaster.
[01:09:26.616 --> 01:09:29.517]  See, terrorism, riots, they mix riots in with terrorism.
[01:09:29.958 --> 01:09:32.999]  Any major disaster, local agencies will be the first to respond.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.202]  That's why Roanoke City wants their disaster training to be as real as possible.
[01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:40.984]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in the drill.
[01:09:41.484 --> 01:09:46.507]  Organizers say the old adage, practice makes perfect, certainly holds true in the face of disaster.
[01:09:48.127 --> 01:09:57.331]  And the reason this is different is in the last year, they come out on the news and they say, we're getting rid of posse comitatus, we want to put troops on the streets, and we're going to fight terror.
[01:09:57.451 --> 01:09:59.532]  But all crime is terror.
[01:10:01.353 --> 01:10:03.394]  Hey, the Army's going to spy on you.
[01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.755]  Hey, we're going to recruit your kids to spy on you.
[01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:08.617]  Now, I had video of that back in 1998.
[01:10:09.097 --> 01:10:11.118]  Heberton, Maryland.
[01:10:13.039 --> 01:10:16.080]  Video of troops with training kids for gun confiscation.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.661]  I mean, folks, we got it on video.
[01:10:20.814 --> 01:10:25.775]  And, you know, in 99, trying to take our guns, the firing troops admitting, you know, doing mock interrogations.
[01:10:25.995 --> 01:10:26.515]  Where are you from?
[01:10:26.535 --> 01:10:27.376]  I'm from San Francisco.
[01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:28.356]  Where'd you get the gun?
[01:10:28.816 --> 01:10:30.256]  Well, you know, my friend in San Francisco.
[01:10:31.037 --> 01:10:32.697]  You know, please, no, not my family!
[01:10:32.737 --> 01:10:33.397]  Don't break us up!
[01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:34.257]  No, not the cab!
[01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.498]  Oh, my God, please!
[01:10:35.858 --> 01:10:37.798]  And the troops, oh, no, we don't have to do this.
[01:10:39.139 --> 01:10:42.139]  I mean, this is like, literally, a science fiction horror movie.
[01:10:42.759 --> 01:10:44.780]  So I've been freaking out all these years over this.
[01:10:45.484 --> 01:10:48.325]  Delta Force trying to bribe police chiefs, I'd go interview them.
[01:10:48.685 --> 01:11:00.067]  Foreign Czech Republic troops with special forces blowing up buildings in South Texas, terrorizing, crashing helicopters into a skyrise in Houston, firing machine gun bullets into an all-night Miami restaurant.
[01:11:02.268 --> 01:11:07.249]  All part of desensitization for the troops, for the police, for everybody.
[01:11:08.146 --> 01:11:09.786]  But now it's so overt.
[01:11:10.306 --> 01:11:12.187]  On this video they're calling people rebels.
[01:11:12.247 --> 01:11:14.367]  They go, you'll see snipers killing the terrorists.
[01:11:14.527 --> 01:11:18.308]  You know, it shows the police, you know, doing the mock shooting of the protesters.
[01:11:20.028 --> 01:11:34.291]  And man, I tell you, the firefighters and police that volunteered for this to work against the other police and military that are attacking them, National Guard and State Guard, and in some cases we've been to these drills, they have regular Army, regular Marines.
[01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:36.811]  I mean, they're really
[01:11:37.363 --> 01:11:38.343]  They're beating people up.
[01:11:38.403 --> 01:11:41.544]  I know a lot of cops, they test tasers on each other.
[01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:45.125]  But man, they like run over these cops and firemen, they're like stomping on them.
[01:11:45.145 --> 01:11:54.267]  If you watch the video closely, you'll see people getting out of control, and you'll see like a big officer get mad and throw somebody in the military off a cop they were stomping on.
[01:11:55.087 --> 01:12:03.669]  Well, it's like they hired, um, they had military men claim they were Al-Qaeda and ship them to Camp X-Ray and they beat them half to death.
[01:12:03.689 --> 01:12:05.849]  One of them's halfway in a coma right now.
[01:12:07.506 --> 01:12:13.629]  Oh, no, they're not torturing people, just military and drills, or, you know, got tubes up their noses.
[01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:16.671]  I mean, you know, I mean, this is how hardcore it is.
[01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:22.894]  And they're practicing doing a mock takeover of the city hall and the local school that's been taken over.
[01:12:24.352 --> 01:12:25.913]  And, well, enough of me.
[01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:43.048]  Here's the disgusting, scary, Orwellian, Stasi, sovietized, redcoat-loving, totally un-American, classical textbook, martial law, just terrifying evil.
[01:12:43.308 --> 01:12:43.809]  Here it is.
[01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:50.274]  Covering your hometown from newsrooms across the region, this is News 7 at 11.
[01:12:53.112 --> 01:12:59.617]  The scenario was a fake, but the pepper spray and billy clubs used to break up this riot were definitely real.
[01:13:00.758 --> 01:13:02.199]  Good evening, I'm Miranda Stephens.
[01:13:02.219 --> 01:13:08.464]  Whether it's terrorism, riots, or any major disaster, local agencies will be the first to respond.
[01:13:08.825 --> 01:13:13.408]  That's why Roanoke City wants its disaster training to be as real as possible.
[01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:15.110]  Jeremy Butterfield has more.
[01:13:18.735 --> 01:13:24.846]  It's supposed to look like a riot, and the scene at William Fleming High School had all the elements.
[01:13:25.385 --> 01:13:30.528]  I'm one of the rioters, the guard and the police force had to take down an arrest and did very successfully.
[01:13:31.889 --> 01:13:34.511]  In this scenario, everyone has a role to play.
[01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:45.678]  The rioters were ready to fight back as Roanoke Police, Roanoke Fire, local National Guard troops and members of the Virginia Defense Force secured perimeters and moved in to make the arrest.
[01:13:48.092 --> 01:13:52.780]  Prior to 9-11, these organizations couldn't communicate and did not work together.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.604]  They worked to support each other, but not together.
[01:13:56.325 --> 01:14:01.834]  With the recent events of the last three to five years, we've become very good at working together.
[01:14:04.548 --> 01:14:06.469]  Of course, these weren't real rioters.
[01:14:06.789 --> 01:14:13.334]  The rebels in t-shirts were all members of one of the participating agencies, but you couldn't tell that during the exercise.
[01:14:13.694 --> 01:14:24.881]  If you weren't protected by an orange vest signifying you as an observer, you were in danger of being hit by eggs, bottles, billy clubs, or even the occasional well-placed round from a sniper.
[01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:28.604]  We try to make this very real, give a real feel to it.
[01:14:28.644 --> 01:14:30.445]  The fire department provided some
[01:14:31.109 --> 01:14:36.513]  Some live burning out here, so we had smoke, flames, objects being thrown, a lot of chaos.
[01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:41.657]  There's going to be a lot of chaos in a civil disturbance situation, and that's what we want to try to incorporate as much as possible.
[01:14:42.518 --> 01:14:44.179]  Teamwork plays a major role.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:51.105]  Mountain Police had to coordinate with the Fire Department, while National Guard troops marched in formation toward the rioters.
[01:14:51.485 --> 01:14:56.729]  Without cooperation throughout all the agencies, the riders would have quickly taken control.
[01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:58.911]  I think everybody learned a little bit.
[01:14:59.472 --> 01:15:03.515]  Mistakes are made, but we'd rather make those mistakes here than in a real situation.
[01:15:04.436 --> 01:15:14.343]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill, and organizers say the old adage, practice makes perfect, certainly holds true in the face of disaster.
[01:15:14.864 --> 01:15:17.086]  Jeremy Butterfield, News 7, Roanoke.
[01:15:18.607 --> 01:15:21.008]  Now if you listen carefully, you can go to the website and watch it.
[01:15:21.028 --> 01:15:21.929]  It's much more powerful.
[01:15:22.529 --> 01:15:23.570]  They say rebels.
[01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:26.852]  And I watched the video about four times this morning.
[01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:29.373]  It's exactly what I videotaped and witnessed before.
[01:15:30.314 --> 01:15:31.555]  Rebels is what it is.
[01:15:32.976 --> 01:15:36.017]  There's a PDD-25 gun confiscation going on.
[01:15:36.638 --> 01:15:39.159]  And this is the most common scenario.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.121]  Evil militias have taken over the City Hall.
[01:15:42.868 --> 01:15:50.835]  Citizens are aiding them, because the citizens have been turned against the government by the evil propaganda of the slick, evil militia members.
[01:15:50.875 --> 01:15:51.315]  This is the MO.
[01:15:51.795 --> 01:15:52.936]  This is public.
[01:15:53.817 --> 01:15:55.599]  And so we've got to go in and kill them.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.422]  And they come in and start shooting.
[01:15:59.442 --> 01:16:06.588]  Of course, in real life, folks, I really feel sorry for the military, because unlike the
[01:16:08.112 --> 01:16:12.473]  The adage the Marines have, thank God, that the Arabs can't aim a gun.
[01:16:13.054 --> 01:16:14.254]  This is still America.
[01:16:14.994 --> 01:16:17.935]  And I don't want it to come to this, but, I mean, one patriot.
[01:16:18.895 --> 01:16:19.695]  Well, look at what happened in 1776.
[01:16:19.756 --> 01:16:20.796]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:16:20.856 --> 01:16:24.437]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:27.218]  You just can't keep a coming against somebody in the right.
[01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:29.658]  So train all you want and do whatever you want.
[01:16:29.979 --> 01:16:31.259]  You know, they have Mardi Gras.
[01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:37.832]  In San Antonio or Fiesta, before 9-11, they'd have troops out searching people, pushing people around.
[01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:45.318]  Now in Mardi Gras, down in Galveston, checkpoints, troops, National Guard, regular armies out searching everybody.
[01:16:45.878 --> 01:16:50.882]  I've had police officers who were in the Texas Defense Force bring me the manuals, folks.
[01:16:50.942 --> 01:16:54.865]  I mean, the do-not-distribute manual, where it's gun confiscation.
[01:16:55.505 --> 01:16:58.187]  Everything's a new, it's new, folks.
[01:16:58.868 --> 01:17:01.390]  And it's all about how to go into houses and take guns.
[01:17:02.688 --> 01:17:05.190]  In a mechanized, house-to-house fashion.
[01:17:07.111 --> 01:17:07.711]  That's criminal!
[01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:09.572]  That's un-American, that's illegal.
[01:17:10.273 --> 01:17:16.976]  But I do have the local news out of Green Bay, where the police chiefs say, we need to get guns out of citizens' hands.
[01:17:17.056 --> 01:17:18.077]  Guns are bad.
[01:17:18.697 --> 01:17:20.338]  Citizens owning guns is bad.
[01:17:21.479 --> 01:17:22.720]  I mean, they're on record, folks.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.661]  They want our guns, they want them bad.
[01:17:26.201 --> 01:17:27.683]  And, uh, it's really real.
[01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:37.572]  You know, I wish they'd train the police to engage the Los Zetas that are blowing up and car bombs and killing people and rocketing, uh, the U.S.
[01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:38.813]  Embassy on the border.
[01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.457]  Oh, but that's going to be kept real quiet, isn't it?
[01:17:43.095 --> 01:17:43.956]  That's a real threat.
[01:17:44.476 --> 01:17:46.718]  Oh, and Los Zetas was trained by our government.
[01:17:46.798 --> 01:17:47.439]  Just type it in.
[01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:50.081]  Los Zetas drug gangs trained by U.S.
[01:17:50.161 --> 01:17:52.003]  Army and CIA.
[01:17:52.063 --> 01:17:59.369]  You'll get all the mainstream articles and as soon as they graduate, they go rogue and start killing all the government's competition.
[01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.831]  No, you're not going to deal with a real threat.
[01:18:03.172 --> 01:18:05.955]  Five dead cops in a month alone on our side.
[01:18:05.975 --> 01:18:07.035]  Eighteen on their side.
[01:18:07.696 --> 01:18:08.657]  No, you're not going to.
[01:18:09.403 --> 01:18:10.503]  You're not going to deal with that.
[01:18:10.563 --> 01:18:20.786]  You're going to learn how to, when people are rioting and begging for food, and when, because you're going to pull something off real big, you've got to learn how to shove us around and let us know we're scum.
[01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:36.930]  It's all about bathing us in enslavement, bathing us in serfdom, basting us in being groveling worms, training us how to be nothing but minions, gelding us, castrating us, emasculating us,
[01:18:37.632 --> 01:18:43.778]  Turning us into little bug-eyed slaves that beg and plead and bow and stoop.
[01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.761]  Domesticating the American people.
[01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:48.943]  That's all it is.
[01:18:49.764 --> 01:18:51.746]  Fitting us with our new ball and chain.

[01:19:05.673 --> 01:19:14.943]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.

[01:20:49.982 --> 01:20:51.023]  Currency devaluation.
[01:20:51.103 --> 01:20:51.303]  Inflation.
[01:20:51.323 --> 01:20:52.103]  One and the same.
[01:20:53.104 --> 01:20:58.767]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.061]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:13.121 --> 01:21:13.662]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:14.602]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:14.942 --> 01:21:15.463]  Here is reality.
[01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:16.884]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:32.813]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:33.553 --> 01:21:37.434]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:23:04.619 --> 01:23:14.045]  There's just so much other news and more on the media hyping the nuke threat and why did this four-star general leave?
[01:23:14.065 --> 01:23:14.925]  New developments there.
[01:23:15.566 --> 01:23:19.448]  Right now, let's go to Mike in Texas and Rafael, Carlos, Jeff, Melissa and others.
[01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.969]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:21.390]  Go ahead.
[01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:26.533]  I've been listening to your show about four or five years now and the time's getting very short.
[01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:27.854]  All I want to ask is
[01:23:29.093 --> 01:23:35.237]  How come you don't put the... The reason why all this judgment is coming out of America is because people have rejected Christ.
[01:23:35.638 --> 01:23:42.543]  How come you don't put the gospel on your website?
[01:23:42.823 --> 01:23:46.145]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:23:46.205 --> 01:23:55.372]  Should every show and every magazine and every book... Should a Remington 700 rifle have scripture printed on the stock?
[01:23:55.952 --> 01:23:56.933]  No, I'm talking about...
[01:23:58.248 --> 01:24:00.830]  I'm talking about on the website that you put out.
[01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:02.211]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:04.033]  You say you've been listening for four or five years.
[01:24:04.613 --> 01:24:06.835]  Number one, sir, I have a news program.
[01:24:06.855 --> 01:24:09.257]  I also analyze information.
[01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:10.798]  I also rant and rave.
[01:24:11.719 --> 01:24:13.641]  You know, I'm very serious about what I do.
[01:24:14.301 --> 01:24:21.507]  And we actually do have some pastors on Monday through Friday, like Butch Paul, on this network.
[01:24:22.136 --> 01:24:38.863]  But I think a criticism that I don't do a purely religious show... No, I didn't say purely religious... Well, I want you to know, sir, sir, sir, that I've been criticized by affiliates and stations, and I just have ignored it, for having pastors on and talking about my belief in God.
[01:24:39.243 --> 01:24:48.207]  So I really resent what you're saying, and I think, I mean, you can find a whole passel of people that all they do is talk about God all day, but they'll tell you George Bush is good.
[01:24:48.923 --> 01:24:54.304]  So, uh, this is a news program and, uh, it's analysis and, uh, my website's a news site, sir.
[01:24:55.105 --> 01:24:55.945]  Uh, one more thing.
[01:24:56.005 --> 01:24:57.905]  So, uh... Hey, I got an idea.
[01:24:57.945 --> 01:24:59.346]  Why don't you put up a website about it?
[01:24:59.366 --> 01:24:59.746]  I am.
[01:24:59.786 --> 01:25:00.846]  I've been thinking about it.
[01:25:00.986 --> 01:25:01.186]  Good.
[01:25:01.206 --> 01:25:01.826]  You need to do that.
[01:25:01.986 --> 01:25:02.746]  You need to do that.
[01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:03.947]  Before you... Hold on.
[01:25:03.987 --> 01:25:08.128]  Before you, uh, tell me about the speck in my eye, you need to get the beam out of yours.
[01:25:08.328 --> 01:25:11.048]  Well, why are you being a profiteer with all your movies and stuff?
[01:25:11.408 --> 01:25:11.929]  Yeah, I knew it.
[01:25:11.949 --> 01:25:14.529]  You're the guy that sent me... Why don't you put it on the right... Thanks for the call.
[01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:15.209]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.530]  That guy sent me a hateful email
[01:25:18.419 --> 01:25:21.162]  This morning, and he's mad that I didn't respond.
[01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:25.947]  And I think he's the same individual that's impersonated me before, but he didn't do a very good job of it.
[01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:27.368]  Hey, listen, scumbag.
[01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.831]  Let me just tell you something.
[01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:31.472]  I don't know how I know this stuff.
[01:25:32.113 --> 01:25:35.036]  I heard that guy immediately, and I knew who he was.
[01:25:36.152 --> 01:25:37.072]  I have no idea.
[01:25:37.152 --> 01:25:37.893]  It's just boom!
[01:25:38.453 --> 01:25:41.514]  But I can't ever go off my instincts because they're not always right.
[01:25:41.694 --> 01:25:42.635]  They're wrong sometimes.
[01:25:42.655 --> 01:25:45.896]  So even though they're almost always correct, I can't go off of them.
[01:25:45.916 --> 01:25:47.817]  So I let the guy keep going.
[01:25:48.437 --> 01:25:51.418]  And listen, no stalkers allowed, sir.
[01:25:52.539 --> 01:25:52.919]  Okay?
[01:25:52.959 --> 01:25:58.001]  I know you hate me and because you've got your father's spirit in you.
[01:25:59.462 --> 01:26:02.763]  And you've tried to concoct new attacks on me, scumbag.
[01:26:03.733 --> 01:26:04.454]  But keep it up.
[01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.095]  In fact, I had a headache this morning.
[01:26:06.575 --> 01:26:09.518]  I don't have a lot of energy, but you just... it just energized me.
[01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:10.819]  You gave me focus.
[01:26:10.839 --> 01:26:12.680]  You gave me clarity of what I'm fighting.
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:16.623]  Thank you for all the persecution you brought against me.
[01:26:17.424 --> 01:26:18.004]  Thank you.
[01:26:18.164 --> 01:26:20.526]  So, really, man, I was just energized.
[01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:21.267]  Whoa!
[01:26:21.587 --> 01:26:22.227]  That was good.
[01:26:23.288 --> 01:26:25.550]  Let's talk to Rafael in Florida.
[01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:26.450]  Go ahead, Rafael.
[01:26:26.751 --> 01:26:27.591]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:26:27.751 --> 01:26:28.112]  Good, sir.
[01:26:28.672 --> 01:26:32.275]  I was viciously attacked by these domestic terrorists on Friday night, and it was
[01:26:32.714 --> 01:26:33.314]  It was horrible.
[01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:35.576]  I mean it was absolutely incredible what happened.
[01:26:36.396 --> 01:26:53.008]  Basically what happened was I was riding my bicycle on the beach side here in Daytona Beach, Daytona Beach Shores and I crossed the street and all of a sudden I'm being followed or chased by one of these domestic terrorists and I get off the bike.
[01:26:53.068 --> 01:26:56.190]  The first thing he does is hold me at gunpoint with a
[01:26:57.202 --> 01:26:58.203]  You know, one of those tasers.
[01:26:58.583 --> 01:26:59.664]  Oh yeah, that's freedom.
[01:26:59.704 --> 01:27:02.266]  Everything's about aiming guns at us and aiming weapons at us.
[01:27:02.727 --> 01:27:02.927]  Right.
[01:27:02.987 --> 01:27:09.332]  At this point, I'm in fear for my life, so I don't really know... Well, see, the tasers are a training aid to be more vicious.
[01:27:09.853 --> 01:27:10.033]  Yeah.
[01:27:10.993 --> 01:27:12.694]  Then he tells me to get on the ground.
[01:27:12.774 --> 01:27:13.755]  Get on the ground now!
[01:27:14.235 --> 01:27:15.335]  And I froze up.
[01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.036]  I didn't know what to do.
[01:27:16.076 --> 01:27:16.916]  I was just in a complete daze.
[01:27:16.936 --> 01:27:20.078]  He thought he was back at the Marine Corps and this was a part of a drill, yeah.
[01:27:20.498 --> 01:27:21.499]  Exactly.
[01:27:21.619 --> 01:27:23.040]  Then he requests me to do it again.
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.461]  Get on the ground now!
[01:27:24.721 --> 01:27:25.741]  Or, get on the ground, please.
[01:27:25.761 --> 01:27:26.442]  Get on the ground now!
[01:27:26.482 --> 01:27:27.222]  Something like that.
[01:27:27.762 --> 01:27:28.903]  And I still didn't do it.
[01:27:29.023 --> 01:27:31.505]  And then he shoots me with the taser.
[01:27:31.545 --> 01:27:32.345]  The taser didn't work.
[01:27:32.385 --> 01:27:33.586]  I don't know if the battery was dead.
[01:27:34.026 --> 01:27:34.766]  Adrenaline rush.
[01:27:35.047 --> 01:27:38.268]  So he just shot you once you were just standing there?
[01:27:38.348 --> 01:27:38.529]  Yes.
[01:27:40.724 --> 01:27:44.706]  The sinister evil look in the eye was what gave it away to me.
[01:27:44.746 --> 01:27:46.887]  I'm dealing with some seriously evil people here.
[01:27:46.907 --> 01:27:50.409]  Oh yeah, when he hit you with it, was it a pleasure look?
[01:27:50.509 --> 01:27:52.030]  A clenching of the teeth?
[01:27:52.890 --> 01:27:53.130]  Yes.
[01:27:53.431 --> 01:27:55.772]  And this is a little buck fifty dude.
[01:27:55.792 --> 01:27:59.694]  And me, I'm like 220, so he's like really, really gonna... No, no, he's mad.
[01:27:59.754 --> 01:28:01.935]  He's got issues and he never developed as a man.
[01:28:02.335 --> 01:28:03.455]  Not that little guys aren't tough.
[01:28:03.495 --> 01:28:04.336]  I'm not that big of a guy.
[01:28:04.356 --> 01:28:06.717]  But the point is, is that he never developed as a man.
[01:28:06.777 --> 01:28:08.478]  It's now time to punish you.
[01:28:08.798 --> 01:28:08.998]  Right.
[01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:10.618]  He's afraid.
[01:28:10.658 --> 01:28:13.961]  He lives in fear, so he becomes what he actually fears.
[01:28:14.261 --> 01:28:14.742]  Exactly.
[01:28:16.663 --> 01:28:18.345]  I'll tell you what, you want to finish up your story, Rafael?
[01:28:18.385 --> 01:28:19.426]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:21.087]  He had a God.
[01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:24.550]  A God that didn't like the fact that he didn't jump fast enough.
[01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:26.552]  So he paid.
[01:28:28.313 --> 01:28:30.115]  But thank God the taser didn't go off.
[01:28:30.175 --> 01:28:31.216]  Maybe he didn't get purchased.
[01:28:32.286 --> 01:28:36.872]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a lavish plug for my videos.
[01:28:37.252 --> 01:28:38.554]  So get your pens and papers ready.
[01:28:38.594 --> 01:28:41.717]  Anytime I get criticized for selling videos, I double the plugging.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.301]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.782 --> 01:28:47.404]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:50.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.053 --> 01:29:02.321]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:29:02.561 --> 01:29:06.925]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:29:07.225 --> 01:29:16.133]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:29:16.334 --> 01:29:19.937]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:29:20.257 --> 01:29:25.282]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:29:25.583 --> 01:29:32.329]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:33.330]  What about you?
[01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:39.422]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:57.722]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:29:57.942 --> 01:29:58.642]  Prepare yourself.

[01:30:12.749 --> 01:30:14.310]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[01:30:23.837 --> 01:30:24.137]  U.S.
[01:30:24.177 --> 01:30:25.217]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[01:30:25.317 --> 01:30:26.417]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[01:30:26.577 --> 01:30:27.338]  Which are collectible?
[01:30:27.398 --> 01:30:28.118]  Which are bullion?
[01:30:28.198 --> 01:30:31.178]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:32.799]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[01:30:32.839 --> 01:30:33.219]  Coins.

[01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:56.694]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.935 --> 01:31:00.777]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:31:01.097 --> 01:31:01.917]  Read the labels.
[01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:06.480]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:10.882]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:11.262 --> 01:31:16.125]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:20.107]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:31:20.288 --> 01:31:25.631]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:31:25.911 --> 01:31:28.633]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:31:28.933 --> 01:31:29.814]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:31:54.388 --> 01:32:00.011]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:00.471 --> 01:32:09.616]  Okay, we're gonna go back to
[01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:15.135]  Rafael and Carlos and Jeff and Melissa and Chris, everybody.
[01:32:16.356 --> 01:32:18.197]  But I've got a few words to say about something.
[01:32:19.938 --> 01:32:26.083]  You know, when Peter Jennings gets $18 million a year, or did, to read off a teleprompter, you don't have a problem with it.
[01:32:27.624 --> 01:32:31.867]  Or when some baseball player gets $25 million a year to hit baseballs, you think it's great.
[01:32:32.307 --> 01:32:36.390]  Or when Rush Limbaugh gets $40 to $50 million a year, you think it's wonderful.
[01:32:38.087 --> 01:32:44.411]  Meanwhile, I have literally been, you know, looking at my ballot sheet and saying, man, can I keep these employees I've got?
[01:32:44.871 --> 01:32:46.312]  Man, I really need to hire somebody else.
[01:32:46.372 --> 01:32:47.432]  I could do so much more.
[01:32:48.053 --> 01:32:49.514]  Oh, I could fight the New World Order.
[01:32:50.694 --> 01:32:52.855]  What is wrong with us making money?
[01:32:53.296 --> 01:32:57.318]  I mean, on top of it, I should make copies of my videos so they have a much more powerful effect.
[01:32:57.338 --> 01:33:00.800]  But, I mean, I've had the major newspapers attack me.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.241]  I've had, you know, the Feds attack me.
[01:33:02.821 --> 01:33:06.083]  Oh, you know, the ADL, Alex Jones makes money selling videos.
[01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:10.889]  And then they quote patriot crowd people on the payroll.
[01:33:10.929 --> 01:33:12.570]  They're out there saying the exact same M.O.
[01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:13.290]  It means nothing.
[01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:14.431]  It isn't effective.
[01:33:14.491 --> 01:33:15.531]  Everyone sees through you.
[01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:16.351]  It's a joke.
[01:33:16.812 --> 01:33:17.812]  But I will say this.
[01:33:17.832 --> 01:33:21.053]  You know, I only spend about a minute and a half on average per hour.
[01:33:21.274 --> 01:33:22.214]  It's not even that lately.
[01:33:22.254 --> 01:33:24.475]  I've been like maybe twice a day, maybe once a day.
[01:33:25.696 --> 01:33:31.638]  I should every hour on the hour talk about the videos and books that I've written or that I carry or that I've made.
[01:33:33.079 --> 01:33:35.380]  Because that's the most effective thing we've got.
[01:33:37.483 --> 01:33:40.605]  Very, very, very, very effective.
[01:33:42.447 --> 01:33:43.668]  And yeah, I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:33:43.708 --> 01:33:45.089]  I like buying a nice pair of shoes.
[01:33:45.129 --> 01:33:46.230]  I like driving a nice car.
[01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.910]  Send me your money.
[01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:51.614]  I mean, you know, 95% of the money that comes in here fights the New World Order.
[01:33:51.654 --> 01:33:52.655]  I work all the time.
[01:33:53.135 --> 01:33:57.959]  You hear me at, you know, two in the morning where you live on your radio, you know, doing live interviews.
[01:33:57.979 --> 01:33:58.819]  You hear me all over.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.941]  I'm totally obsessed with the New World Order.
[01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:05.605]  My wife and I were freaking out watching that video this morning saying, should we leave the country?
[01:34:05.665 --> 01:34:07.066]  I mean, you know, it's real to us.
[01:34:07.686 --> 01:34:22.389]  Our total focus is fighting the New World Order, and yeah, it'd make it easy on us if you'd support us more and buy more of the videos, so I could take that money and hire better people, more people, so I could, you know, get even better computers, make better films.
[01:34:22.409 --> 01:34:24.009]  I mean, that's my lust.
[01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:25.150]  That's my passion.
[01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:27.650]  That's my... I mean, I'm really into this, folks.
[01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:29.930]  I mean, I'm into the human species surviving.
[01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:30.771]  I love God.
[01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:32.391]  I mean, I'm a pure person.
[01:34:33.471 --> 01:34:35.352]  You know, I'm pure greedy sometimes.
[01:34:35.432 --> 01:34:40.075]  I'm pure lusting after women and I have to get myself back in line because I'm a man.
[01:34:40.995 --> 01:34:45.277]  You know, I've got to keep myself away from the cerveza and the old cigarettos, too.
[01:34:45.337 --> 01:34:45.818]  Big deal.
[01:34:45.878 --> 01:34:46.358]  So what?
[01:34:47.078 --> 01:34:52.882]  You know, I'm a human being and I'm the real deal and so are you and let's get in this fight.
[01:34:53.682 --> 01:34:59.185]  And there's a disease of little provocateurs and hired agents and then their camp followers
[01:35:00.678 --> 01:35:06.702]  That hate people that are passionate, that hate people that are real, that hate people that are taking action.
[01:35:07.943 --> 01:35:27.655]  Listen, the robber barons colluded and created monopolies, and made those billions and billions in profits a hundred and something years ago, and put that money in tax-free foundations, hundreds of billions of dollars, to get rid of our borders, to dumb our children down, to take God out of schools, to get abortion into law, so they could kill babies.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.542]  We don't have hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:35:30.582 --> 01:35:31.924]  We don't have millions of dollars.
[01:35:32.965 --> 01:35:34.727]  And we need capital.
[01:35:34.767 --> 01:35:35.588]  We need support.
[01:35:35.648 --> 01:35:46.541]  I mean, I know so many people, so many patriots who have plenty of capital, won't even pay their employees well, constantly begging for money, and it's disgusting.
[01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:47.482]  I don't do that.
[01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:57.958]  But I started thinking, you know, if I'm going to get criticized for making videos and saying I made copies of them, and I know that if I had more money I could do a lot more, then yeah, send me money!
[01:35:58.498 --> 01:36:14.302]  Listen, folks, those of you out there, say what you want to spend on the website or on films or on outreach, and I guarantee you that 100% of money that's donated will be spent on fighting the New World Order.
[01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:16.063]  You know,
[01:36:16.744 --> 01:36:18.846]  But you can't do anything right, folks.
[01:36:20.247 --> 01:36:27.732]  They murdered the Branch Davidians, and then the Supreme Court said, let them go, those that survived out of prison, and the government just didn't do it.
[01:36:28.092 --> 01:36:35.198]  They were found not guilty of the crimes, but then Judge Walter Smith said, well, they're found guilty of using weapons in the commission of a crime.
[01:36:35.478 --> 01:36:39.821]  Well, how are you found guilty of using weapons in the commission of a crime if you weren't found guilty for the crime?
[01:36:41.222 --> 01:36:45.085]  And we just built a veteran a new house, and again,
[01:36:46.022 --> 01:36:49.003]  I just instinctively knew how the government operated.
[01:36:49.023 --> 01:36:51.184]  So we're trying to build a veteran a new house, Joe Campana.
[01:36:51.424 --> 01:36:53.424]  I'll tell the Davidian story in a minute, then we'll get to your calls.
[01:36:55.285 --> 01:36:58.006]  And this is my first experience.
[01:36:58.066 --> 01:36:59.066]  This is like back in 1998.
[01:37:00.446 --> 01:37:03.407]  And they're going to bulldoze Joe Campana, the World War II veteran's house.
[01:37:04.147 --> 01:37:09.509]  Because it's like an acre and it's worth $500,000 in a nice part of Austin.
[01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:12.090]  And he's a little shell-shocked and a little eccentric.
[01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.210]  He died a couple years ago.
[01:37:14.598 --> 01:37:15.699]  But, you know, that's his business.
[01:37:15.779 --> 01:37:17.580]  And there's a hole in his roof and all this.
[01:37:17.981 --> 01:37:19.041]  Well, we've got to try to fix it.
[01:37:19.082 --> 01:37:23.465]  And the police show up and say, look, you're going to be arrested if you fix that.
[01:37:23.505 --> 01:37:24.066]  It's condemned.
[01:37:24.106 --> 01:37:24.927]  So we said, you know what?
[01:37:25.407 --> 01:37:26.568]  Actually, Mike Hanson did it.
[01:37:26.868 --> 01:37:33.414]  He would always, in a good way, shoot his mouth off and I'd have to, you know, actually get it done with his help.
[01:37:33.754 --> 01:37:35.195]  Well, we'll just build him a new house.
[01:37:37.257 --> 01:37:39.799]  We start building him a new house, a city record 13 days.
[01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.730]  I'm not really superstitious, but I am.
[01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:47.252]  It was 13 days fully furnished with a Jacuzzi hot tub, folks.
[01:37:49.233 --> 01:37:52.755]  But I would say 14 days, because I didn't like the way it sounded in the newspapers.
[01:37:53.235 --> 01:37:54.196]  Mike always corrects me.
[01:37:54.616 --> 01:37:55.376]  13 days, we built it.
[01:37:56.197 --> 01:37:59.258]  But I guess 13 colonies was good luck for America, so I guess it isn't bad.
[01:37:59.459 --> 01:38:03.481]  The point is, is that 13 days to the record.
[01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:05.222]  But I said, we're not taking a dime.
[01:38:06.462 --> 01:38:11.365]  You go to Lowe's, you go to Home Depot, you go to McCoy's, and this is what we need delivered.
[01:38:12.521 --> 01:38:14.643]  And you go make the purchase right there.
[01:38:14.863 --> 01:38:16.164]  And you bring us what we need.
[01:38:17.184 --> 01:38:22.828]  And by the end of it, builders were bringing jacuzzis and big developers.
[01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:25.470]  It was all over the news.
[01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:27.852]  They were bringing furniture, everything.
[01:38:30.113 --> 01:38:36.158]  And I think there was something like a porta potty that we had to get paid for.
[01:38:36.178 --> 01:38:37.919]  It was like $100 or something.
[01:38:40.033 --> 01:38:43.674]  And some lady wrote a check to somebody else to pay for the port-a-potty.
[01:38:43.714 --> 01:38:47.436]  Not even to me, but that turned into... Because it was this local neighbor who wanted the property.
[01:38:47.996 --> 01:38:53.298]  And he was running around screaming, cussing at us over the... Because he was already getting ready to put bids in.
[01:38:53.378 --> 01:38:56.439]  He had to memorize the first few days, and then it turned out he wanted the property.
[01:38:56.459 --> 01:38:57.720]  And this guy was a demon.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.080]  And he... Look at him!
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.741]  They took a hundred dollars!
[01:39:00.781 --> 01:39:02.582]  They took a hundred dollars!
[01:39:02.642 --> 01:39:04.322]  They took a hundred dollars!
[01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:06.143]  Freaking out!
[01:39:06.846 --> 01:39:10.949]  And then all of a sudden undercover cops come in and they're like, we ought to do something to City Hall.
[01:39:10.969 --> 01:39:12.210]  I won't even repeat what they said.
[01:39:12.671 --> 01:39:14.352]  I said, oh, let me walk with you to your car.
[01:39:14.892 --> 01:39:17.254]  And they said, where's your car?
[01:39:17.294 --> 01:39:18.996]  And I said, get cameras over here, it's a cop!
[01:39:19.316 --> 01:39:20.177]  Trying to provocateur!
[01:39:20.277 --> 01:39:22.218]  I said, you get out of here, buddy, right now!
[01:39:22.719 --> 01:39:25.741]  And we followed them over to their car and made that piece of trash leave.
[01:39:26.982 --> 01:39:27.963]  We had that happen before.
[01:39:28.003 --> 01:39:32.126]  But then, a year later, we're out there interviewing the Branch Davidians with Hard Copy.
[01:39:33.347 --> 01:39:34.228]  Was it Hard Copy or
[01:39:36.488 --> 01:39:37.208]  That was Xtra.
[01:39:38.449 --> 01:39:39.630]  We're out there with Xtra.
[01:39:41.091 --> 01:39:42.411]  They had a good producer over there.
[01:39:42.431 --> 01:39:43.652]  What was that Australian's name?
[01:39:44.492 --> 01:39:46.513]  Real nice fellow, knew all about the New World Order.
[01:39:46.934 --> 01:39:50.476]  He'd been at Hard Copy and done that black helicopter piece with me, but then he was at Xtra.
[01:39:51.216 --> 01:39:52.517]  And I'm out there with him and the anchor.
[01:39:52.537 --> 01:40:01.441]  We're doing the interviews and, you know, Clyde Doyle's going, yeah, we'd like to add on to the little shack we've got that's the museum and have a little place to worship in.
[01:40:02.362 --> 01:40:04.183]  And Mike goes, we'll do that.
[01:40:05.555 --> 01:40:11.100]  And I said, oh yeah, Mike, and it's like 100 degrees out there, grasshoppers jumping around everywhere.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:14.923]  Well, needless to say, a week later, there were 200-something volunteers out there.
[01:40:15.184 --> 01:40:15.944]  We did the same thing.
[01:40:16.004 --> 01:40:19.287]  Home Depot, Lowe's, and some other lumberyard there.
[01:40:19.608 --> 01:40:23.071]  We'd say, this is how many bags of concrete we need, this is how many subsets we need.
[01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:29.336]  Then we had people, we'd say, we're using this concrete company, call them and give donations of $20 to get, well, you've all heard it on air.
[01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.618]  But then the trusses came.
[01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:32.539]  This was a big building.
[01:40:33.374 --> 01:40:35.476]  Okay, so we had to have the $8,600 trusses.
[01:40:35.836 --> 01:40:40.299]  And they want the money up front to build these trusses.
[01:40:40.399 --> 01:40:44.322]  After a few weeks in, we got the main structure, the bottom, but we had to get the trusses.
[01:40:45.062 --> 01:40:49.906]  So we got that exact amount into a bank account and gave that for the trusses.
[01:40:51.367 --> 01:40:55.850]  And they came out in the big truck, and the thing seats 400 people, put the big trusses up.
[01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:01.794]  And then all of a sudden, and this was in front of witnesses, in front of the Davidians, in front of Mike Hanson,
[01:41:02.566 --> 01:41:06.569]  These people showed up who kept stirring up trouble for like two, three weeks every weekend we were working.
[01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:10.312]  And finally, I'm sitting there and the woman goes, How dare you!
[01:41:11.232 --> 01:41:13.794]  You took the money for those dresses for yourself!
[01:41:14.715 --> 01:41:16.416]  And all of a sudden I'm like, Man, what's wrong with you?
[01:41:16.436 --> 01:41:21.840]  And she breaks, pulls a butcher knife, comes at me with it and says, You bastard piece of bleeper!
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:23.021]  I am a fan!
[01:41:23.061 --> 01:41:24.302]  We're gonna bring you down!
[01:41:24.522 --> 01:41:25.843]  You're dead, boy!
[01:41:25.863 --> 01:41:28.425]  And they got in their trucks and drove out of there.
[01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:30.847]  Then the Ku Klux Klan comes up there and starts
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:36.364]  Throwing burning objects out of the, out of the, cause they're feds, cause I've gone and bullhorned them in town.
[01:41:37.044 --> 01:41:39.326]  Just cause they happened to be in town, they have a speech I dropped by.
[01:41:39.946 --> 01:41:41.447]  And uh, and so all that happened.
[01:41:41.467 --> 01:41:42.068]  And you know what?
[01:41:43.649 --> 01:41:47.492]  So if I'm going to get criticized for building people memorial churches, look, just fine!
[01:41:47.892 --> 01:41:48.993]  Go ahead and send me money!
[01:41:49.813 --> 01:41:51.394]  And I'll use it to fight the new world order.
[01:41:52.375 --> 01:41:55.077]  I'm eating a, uh, cheese sandwich over here too.
[01:41:55.337 --> 01:41:57.079]  Yeah, some of that money will go to feed me.
[01:41:58.119 --> 01:41:58.820]  Don't I deserve it?
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.241]  Are we communist?
[01:42:01.858 --> 01:42:04.140]  I mean, I'm going to admit, my children wear nice clothes.
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.662]  They're not fancy or anything, but they wear nice clothes from Target.
[01:42:11.324 --> 01:42:12.665]  I'm sick of you people, man.
[01:42:13.706 --> 01:42:18.268]  I mean, you've actually helped me realize that I shouldn't be ashamed to ask for money.
[01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:19.029]  But you know what?
[01:42:19.309 --> 01:42:24.612]  The way I want you to support me and what we do, because you know we work the hardest, anybody out there.
[01:42:24.853 --> 01:42:25.973]  We've got the track record.
[01:42:25.993 --> 01:42:27.334]  We've got the facts to back it up.
[01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:28.395]  We've got the vision.
[01:42:29.133 --> 01:42:34.074]  We've been resisting the New World Order a long time, steadfastly, never stopping, never submitting.
[01:42:34.094 --> 01:42:41.736]  I want you to support us so I can fly to England to get you these reports, so I can go to the border and risk my life to cover losses.
[01:42:41.756 --> 01:42:42.676]  That is killing people.
[01:42:42.696 --> 01:42:43.696]  I'm going to be going there soon.
[01:42:44.277 --> 01:42:47.037]  I never announced my operations until I'm in the field, as you know.
[01:42:48.798 --> 01:42:54.259]  I'll continue to risk my life to get you the reports, to fight the New World Order, to pour my heart and soul out for you.
[01:42:55.023 --> 01:42:57.385]  And my great staff pouring their heart and soul out for you.
[01:42:57.885 --> 01:42:59.406]  Just buy a bunch of my videos.
[01:42:59.446 --> 01:43:00.367]  Get a whole bunch of them.
[01:43:01.368 --> 01:43:04.450]  We got them as low as $5.95 when you order a whole bunch of them.
[01:43:05.991 --> 01:43:07.773]  And get a whole bunch of the DVDs.
[01:43:07.853 --> 01:43:09.254]  Get Joyce Riley's great video.
[01:43:09.274 --> 01:43:10.515]  Man, that thing is powerful.
[01:43:11.175 --> 01:43:13.797]  Beyond Treason aired about 10 minutes of it on TV last night.
[01:43:13.837 --> 01:43:14.778]  They authorized me to do that.
[01:43:15.398 --> 01:43:19.722]  Very, just very effective about them testing chemical and biologicals on our troops.
[01:43:19.762 --> 01:43:20.662]  So buy that from me.
[01:43:20.682 --> 01:43:21.903]  I sell it at the same price they do.
[01:43:22.184 --> 01:43:23.685]  That way they get some support and so do we.
[01:43:24.477 --> 01:43:27.157]  Get Beyond Treason from us, 100 minutes long, incredible.
[01:43:28.178 --> 01:43:30.678]  Get Martial Law, 3 hours long.
[01:43:32.198 --> 01:43:34.379]  Or 180 minutes long.
[01:43:35.519 --> 01:43:37.979]  And get American Dictators, get them all!
[01:43:38.079 --> 01:43:43.440]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, do not wait.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.100]  And order them.
[01:43:45.201 --> 01:43:48.821]  Or if you want to really get them in bulk, call my office.
[01:43:50.021 --> 01:43:53.822]  And we'll get them out to you as cheaply as we can.
[01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:57.296]  And here is the number to call my office.
[01:43:57.316 --> 01:43:57.636]  512-291-5750.
[01:43:57.656 --> 01:43:59.097]  512-291-5750.
[01:43:59.377 --> 01:44:14.345]  If you want to get in real bulk, 512-291-5750, or call toll free to get the videos.
[01:44:15.605 --> 01:44:18.967]  I'm sorry I'm doing this, folks, but the guy said that, so that's my rule when they do this.
[01:44:19.287 --> 01:44:20.328]  I'm proud of what I do.
[01:44:21.348 --> 01:44:24.490]  I'm not proud of some of the things I do in my life, but I'm proud of my work.
[01:44:25.672 --> 01:44:28.694]  I'm proud of my work, and I'm not ashamed of what I do.
[01:44:28.874 --> 01:44:30.095]  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:44:31.436 --> 01:44:33.238]  And impersonating people is illegal, by the way.
[01:44:34.419 --> 01:44:35.800]  But, uh, continuing... 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:36.040]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:44:50.555 --> 01:44:52.736]  These Feds are very upset you're getting the films.
[01:44:53.036 --> 01:44:53.597]  Keep doing it.
[01:44:53.637 --> 01:44:56.958]  Expose you to the terror star.
[01:44:56.978 --> 01:45:00.360]  888-253-3139 or go to infowars.com.
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:04.802]  Look at all the different deals we offer, the different video clips, the different films, and order them online.
[01:45:05.082 --> 01:45:07.203]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:45:07.223 --> 01:45:14.007]  That's what pays our three and a half webmasters, and what pays for the four servers, and believe me, it's expensive.
[01:45:14.027 --> 01:45:14.787]  So we need your support.
[01:45:15.127 --> 01:45:15.748]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[01:45:17.259 --> 01:45:18.540]  See them all in line there right now.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.301]  I'm going to shut up now and I'm done.
[01:45:20.762 --> 01:45:24.724]  Plugging for the day, but there it is in your face.
[01:45:25.325 --> 01:45:30.649]  I want to go to Carlos and others, but quickly, Rafael, so he just pulls you over?
[01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:34.732]  I'm on a bicycle and he stops me.
[01:45:34.912 --> 01:45:42.557]  I get off the bicycle and he immediately holds me at gunpoint and he demands I get on the ground.
[01:45:42.617 --> 01:45:43.858]  Let's be specific, taser point.
[01:45:44.539 --> 01:45:45.519]  Which is a deadly weapon.
[01:45:46.775 --> 01:45:49.137]  He, uh, and that's, this is point blank.
[01:45:49.157 --> 01:45:51.840]  Two deaths a day on average now with the taser.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:52.941]  Go ahead.
[01:45:53.061 --> 01:45:54.983]  And then, uh, he demands I get on the ground.
[01:45:55.563 --> 01:45:56.484]  I don't get on the ground.
[01:45:56.524 --> 01:45:58.266]  I'm wondering why am I being stopped?
[01:45:58.506 --> 01:45:59.727]  You know, why are you pulling me over?
[01:46:00.167 --> 01:46:01.629]  Well, I mean, finish the story though.
[01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:02.950]  He's getting off on the taser.
[01:46:02.970 --> 01:46:04.471]  Did he throw a fit when it didn't work?
[01:46:05.212 --> 01:46:10.557]  That's what I think happened because immediately after that I'm pepper sprayed and beat down with batons or ass.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:16.321]  Which are deadly, and you're not supposed to use those on people unless they have a weapon or you're assaulted by them.
[01:46:16.381 --> 01:46:18.302]  And they're charging me with two felony counts of assault.
[01:46:18.482 --> 01:46:18.982]  Get out of this.
[01:46:19.202 --> 01:46:26.363]  Oh, sir, they always... Now listen, not only do you get your teeth knocked out, I have videoed this countless times, where they... You don't even resist, you ball up!
[01:46:26.703 --> 01:46:33.805]  And they're kicking in, and this was caught on somebody's tape, and then the tape doesn't get released for a week, and you find... And they're already going, he attacked the officers!
[01:46:34.389 --> 01:46:34.589]  Right.
[01:46:34.869 --> 01:46:36.950]  And the whole thing is, I have a broken arm now.
[01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:39.871]  Look, what you've got is scumbag cowards who are wimps.
[01:46:40.431 --> 01:46:40.591]  Right.
[01:46:40.671 --> 01:46:42.591]  A real man doesn't want to beat up on people.
[01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:44.792]  A real man wants to fight bullies.
[01:46:45.492 --> 01:46:47.673]  I like fighting bullies when I used to fight.
[01:46:48.093 --> 01:46:50.293]  A real man doesn't need to go out and prove himself.
[01:46:51.274 --> 01:46:57.896]  And a lot of cops are real men, but a lot of them, and a lot of these butch cops, these females, they like beating people up.
[01:46:58.296 --> 01:47:01.497]  And look, he's scared of you because you were big, and he did that.
[01:47:01.537 --> 01:47:01.837]  You know what?
[01:47:01.857 --> 01:47:02.817]  It's going to come back on him.
[01:47:03.641 --> 01:47:04.581]  Go defeat it in court.
[01:47:04.642 --> 01:47:05.702]  Go through what you have to.
[01:47:06.002 --> 01:47:07.423]  But God is going to judge him.
[01:47:07.483 --> 01:47:08.203]  Not in hell.
[01:47:08.263 --> 01:47:09.444]  That'll happen too.
[01:47:09.524 --> 01:47:10.104]  Listen, brother.
[01:47:10.164 --> 01:47:11.165]  You reap what you sow.
[01:47:11.565 --> 01:47:14.266]  That guy's life, he's going to wonder why he has car wrecks.
[01:47:14.606 --> 01:47:16.067]  He's going to wonder why he gets cancer.
[01:47:16.347 --> 01:47:18.448]  He's going to wonder why he doesn't have a good marriage.
[01:47:18.648 --> 01:47:20.789]  He's going to wonder why bad stuff happens to his kids.
[01:47:21.049 --> 01:47:22.450]  You get cursed, sir.
[01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:26.572]  When you bear false witness, that is one of the worst sins there is.
[01:47:29.221 --> 01:47:29.721]  Anything else?
[01:47:30.081 --> 01:47:34.643]  Yeah, the only reason why I don't have a broken skull is because I put my left arm... I'm a lefty too, by the way.
[01:47:34.663 --> 01:47:36.584]  I put my left arm up and blocked.
[01:47:36.984 --> 01:47:38.685]  You know, at this point... That's assault.
[01:47:38.765 --> 01:47:39.566]  Yeah, that's assault.
[01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.026]  I was beaten by four cops.
[01:47:41.106 --> 01:47:42.587]  Brutally beaten by four cops.
[01:47:43.327 --> 01:47:45.808]  And, yeah, he... I put my arm up... It doesn't matter.
[01:47:45.968 --> 01:47:46.429]  Hey, listen.
[01:47:46.549 --> 01:47:46.849]  Listen.
[01:47:47.069 --> 01:47:47.929]  He broke my arm.
[01:47:48.069 --> 01:47:50.630]  That's gonna come back on them seven-fold.
[01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:51.331]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:51.751 --> 01:47:52.291]  Guaranteed!
[01:47:52.971 --> 01:47:54.012]  Guaranteed!
[01:47:54.964 --> 01:47:56.405]  Seven-fold!
[01:47:56.785 --> 01:47:58.626]  And it sounds like other cops responded, sir.
[01:47:58.666 --> 01:47:59.907]  You need to subpoena that video.
[01:48:00.527 --> 01:48:02.688]  And if they cut it out, show to the jury.
[01:48:02.728 --> 01:48:03.649]  We've done this countless times.
[01:48:04.029 --> 01:48:05.410]  Show how the video cuts out.
[01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:11.513]  Or, oh, by the way, jury, the squad cars that responded, their video wasn't working.
[01:48:12.874 --> 01:48:15.615]  And go, do you want this to be your son or daughter?
[01:48:16.015 --> 01:48:18.257]  And you'll get off after you spend all your money.
[01:48:18.637 --> 01:48:19.377]  But don't worry.
[01:48:19.657 --> 01:48:20.498]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:48:20.618 --> 01:48:20.878]  There.
[01:48:21.238 --> 01:48:22.439]  God is going to deal with him.
[01:48:24.014 --> 01:48:26.236]  Carlos, you're on the air from California.
[01:48:26.256 --> 01:48:26.636]  Go ahead.
[01:48:26.656 --> 01:48:28.198]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:28.598 --> 01:48:28.858]  Hi.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.044]  I've heard you on the Coast to Coast a couple of times the last two weeks.
[01:48:34.544 --> 01:48:39.449]  And you know, undoubtedly, you are the leader fighting the New World Order.
[01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:47.497]  And a lot of people do not understand how valuable you are, the merit of your work, because they do not understand the objectives
[01:48:48.123 --> 01:48:58.352]  The despicable objectives of the New World Order, what they have in store for us, they're going to turn us into a bunch of zombie slaves working for them for $5 an hour.
[01:48:58.392 --> 01:48:59.453]  That's what their plan is.
[01:48:59.613 --> 01:49:00.134]  No, that's it.
[01:49:00.154 --> 01:49:00.534]  You're right.
[01:49:01.335 --> 01:49:03.056]  And they're going to exterminate a whole lot of us.
[01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:08.201]  So, you know, just keep doing what you're doing and I'm going to order a whole bunch of videos from you.
[01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:09.342]  I never have, but I will.
[01:49:09.642 --> 01:49:10.503]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:49:10.523 --> 01:49:12.064]  There's nothing wrong with what you're doing.
[01:49:12.084 --> 01:49:13.085]  You're a great person.
[01:49:14.484 --> 01:49:22.090]  Uh, but besides that, Alex, I was worried about these, uh, war scenarios they are conducting in South Carolina.
[01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:28.734]  Because, uh, you know, it is the strategic time for the New World Order to strike.
[01:49:29.175 --> 01:49:29.595]  That's right.
[01:49:29.635 --> 01:49:30.976]  The stars have aligned.
[01:49:31.216 --> 01:49:32.157]  That's a term, folks.
[01:49:32.177 --> 01:49:32.997]  I don't mean that literally.
[01:49:33.398 --> 01:49:34.478]  Stay there, Carlos.
[01:49:34.518 --> 01:49:35.259]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:49:35.659 --> 01:49:37.400]  Always good to hear from you.
[01:49:38.881 --> 01:49:41.904]  Carlos only calls every few months, but he always has amazing points to make.
[01:49:41.924 --> 01:49:42.704]  Stay there, Carlos.
[01:49:43.184 --> 01:49:43.845]  Then we'll go to Jeff.
[01:49:44.474 --> 01:49:48.163]  And Melissa, and Chris, and everybody else, just stay with us folks.
[01:49:55.265 --> 01:49:58.126]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.386 --> 01:49:59.966]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.307 --> 01:50:04.968]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.308 --> 01:50:09.750]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:14.331]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.571 --> 01:50:17.413]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.493 --> 01:50:22.157]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.377 --> 01:50:26.801]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:27.021 --> 01:50:34.247]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:59.993 --> 01:53:01.094]  There's been so much news.
[01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:02.415]  We are getting your calls right now.
[01:53:02.855 --> 01:53:06.657]  We've got a mini guest coming up later in the next hour to talk about the Second Amendment.
[01:53:07.057 --> 01:53:09.899]  Police Chiefs is coming right out and saying we shouldn't be able to have guns.
[01:53:11.139 --> 01:53:14.861]  But let's go back to Carlos and then Charles and Jeff and Melissa and Chris and everybody.
[01:53:14.881 --> 01:53:16.883]  We'll get to you even before our guest gets on.
[01:53:17.403 --> 01:53:18.644]  Carlos, go ahead and make your point.
[01:53:19.344 --> 01:53:24.927]  So, well, my point is they're trying to justify the war in Iran and they're having a hard time doing it.
[01:53:27.722 --> 01:53:37.791]  And so, the European nations were having talks with Iran concerning the enrichment of plutonium, and those talks were supposed to culminate at the end of July.
[01:53:37.831 --> 01:53:39.032]  In fact, they're probably over.
[01:53:39.592 --> 01:53:42.775]  And then, Arier Sharon was over visiting Bush.
[01:53:43.533 --> 01:53:49.096]  Uh, trying to, uh, stir up, uh, you know, trying to stir up the support for the war in Iran.
[01:53:49.296 --> 01:53:51.197]  Yeah, they've broken the safety seals.
[01:53:51.377 --> 01:53:54.379]  The IAEA's in there with cameras on the work they're doing.
[01:53:54.719 --> 01:53:55.800]  It's totally peaceful.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:01.703]  Meanwhile, Cheney's trying to sell more reactors for weapons to China publicly.
[01:54:01.743 --> 01:54:03.204]  He's actually going to make the money off of it.
[01:54:03.744 --> 01:54:05.065]  He's actually doing that deal.
[01:54:05.565 --> 01:54:12.788]  They protected Khan, the Pakistani scientist that proliferated for North Korea and others, and actually the CIA used him.
[01:54:12.808 --> 01:54:14.688]  This is now public as a conduit.
[01:54:14.988 --> 01:54:18.050]  But we've got to invade Iran because they're going to nuke us.
[01:54:18.450 --> 01:54:21.171]  And yeah, the globalists could detonate something in this country.
[01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:24.552]  Well yeah, they're finding a hard time justifying it.
[01:54:27.412 --> 01:54:35.454]  So they're probably going to have another probably 9-11 scenario to justify the draft and the expansion of the war into Iran.
[01:54:36.154 --> 01:54:53.799]  What angers me is that all these neoconservatives, Douglas Fain, Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Wormser, Michael Ledeen, are pushing, are really the force behind the war in the Middle East, but behind them is William Crystal from Fox,
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.581]  And behind Crystal, of course, is Rupert Murdoch.
[01:54:58.401 --> 01:55:11.965]  And when you go back behind Rupert Murdoch, the financial force of the Rothschild banking family, when you start connecting these dots, it all leads to the elitist banking families that are driving this new world order force.
[01:55:12.085 --> 01:55:13.246]  Well, no, I mean, it's true.
[01:55:13.306 --> 01:55:15.006]  I mean, what you're saying really is a fact.
[01:55:15.887 --> 01:55:23.389]  And it's the same crew that funded Hitler, the same crew that funded Lenin and Stalin and Mao.
[01:55:24.142 --> 01:55:26.863]  I mean, our government admits they put Mao into power.
[01:55:26.883 --> 01:55:27.683]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:55:27.703 --> 01:55:33.906]  I mean, I knew it ten years ago, but five years ago I saw it on the History Channel and literally almost fell out of my chair.
[01:55:35.046 --> 01:55:37.947]  But, I mean, no, they set this up.
[01:55:38.667 --> 01:55:41.068]  And it endangers all of us, Carlos, as you know.
[01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:48.391]  Well, of course, and that's why I was worried about these scenarios that are taking place, because twice it's happened.
[01:55:48.411 --> 01:55:53.293]  9-11 had a simulation going on at the same time, so London did have the same thing.
[01:55:53.866 --> 01:55:59.731]  And we're having this in August, and this is strategic time for them to act.
[01:55:59.751 --> 01:56:00.191]  No, you're right.
[01:56:00.211 --> 01:56:05.876]  The windows there, they're fear-mongering at the same time on TV saying, it's going to happen any minute.
[01:56:06.636 --> 01:56:10.599]  You put all that together, and then a month ago I got a Pentagon call saying, watch this drill.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:13.682]  We've been watching it that long since it was announced a month ago.
[01:56:14.422 --> 01:56:21.485]  And then now the general over the base gets fired, and they say for sexual impropriety, but nobody knows who it is.
[01:56:21.845 --> 01:56:26.848]  And then it turns out he was already getting a divorce six months ago, and then none of it holds water.
[01:56:27.268 --> 01:56:33.250]  And then we have reporters with other sources getting the same info I'm getting, so... But we may be backing him off.
[01:56:33.591 --> 01:56:35.071]  Carlos, always good to hear from you.
[01:56:35.712 --> 01:56:36.432]  Thank you, good luck.
[01:56:36.612 --> 01:56:38.013]  Appreciate it, my friend, thank you.
[01:56:38.393 --> 01:56:42.615]  Charles in Louisiana, then we'll go to Jeff and Michael and Michelle and Chris and everybody.
[01:56:42.635 --> 01:56:43.495]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:56:44.548 --> 01:56:44.908]  Alex Jones?
[01:56:45.309 --> 01:56:45.569]  Yes.
[01:56:46.330 --> 01:56:55.500]  I want to say something about these people not donating to the show and I'm not trying to hurt nobody's feelings, but you shouldn't feel guilty for trying to ask them to donate.
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:58.443]  You care more about their children and their family than they do.
[01:56:59.122 --> 01:57:04.645]  I'll tell you, I am so sick of Louisiana and people not supporting the show, I'm thinking about quit passing tapes out.
[01:57:04.925 --> 01:57:11.428]  Because these people can't reach in their pocket and take $20 for you to protect their family, ain't much of a man.
[01:57:11.988 --> 01:57:16.571]  And for that guy getting beat, I know I've been beat for 17 years by these people in prison.
[01:57:16.831 --> 01:57:21.373]  And I'm trying to stop this from happening to them, and they don't give me support.
[01:57:21.853 --> 01:57:27.136]  And I'm going to start quick making the tapes and I'm going to start sending you the money because these people are not worth it.
[01:57:27.156 --> 01:57:28.016]  No, don't do that.
[01:57:28.116 --> 01:57:29.257]  Make copies of the videos.
[01:57:29.737 --> 01:57:30.138]  Stay there.
[01:57:30.178 --> 01:57:30.818]  Stay there, Charles.
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:37.982]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.302 --> 01:57:39.102]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.183 --> 01:57:50.843]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.483 --> 01:57:52.584]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.264 --> 01:57:54.364]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.005 --> 01:57:55.865]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.585 --> 01:57:58.125]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.166 --> 01:58:02.107]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.347 --> 01:58:06.468]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.169 --> 01:58:19.032]  Look, tyranny is when the most low-level street thug that has a uniform can beat you up and he doesn't get in trouble because he's government, and the government looks out for itself.
[01:58:19.674 --> 01:58:25.617]  No, no, the government is supposed to look out for the people and serve the people, not call themselves authorities and officials.
[01:58:25.857 --> 01:58:28.578]  And I know Charles in Louisiana.
[01:58:28.818 --> 01:58:35.901]  I mean, I've confirmed through other sources in Louisiana, Charles for five, six years has made over, I don't know, 5,000 copies of videos.
[01:58:35.941 --> 01:58:37.041]  It's had a huge effect.
[01:58:37.101 --> 01:58:48.406]  Charles has gone from the point of cops threatening to arrest him for on the street corner, you know, spreading the word about the New World Order, to begging him for more copies of videos and paying him for, you know, dubs.
[01:58:49.108 --> 01:58:51.389]  And no, Charles, that's the most important thing.
[01:58:52.030 --> 01:59:00.214]  Keep making copies of the films, keep doing what you're doing, and just because there's some idiots around you who don't want to get up and get involved, they don't even count.
[01:59:00.254 --> 01:59:01.855]  They're called furniture.
[01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:03.256]  They're in the bleachers.
[01:59:03.376 --> 01:59:05.937]  You're on the field, and I salute you.
[01:59:06.497 --> 01:59:07.198]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:59:07.218 --> 01:59:10.219]  The people that call up here should find $20.
[01:59:10.339 --> 01:59:13.961]  Listen, I'm not a rich man.
[01:59:13.981 --> 01:59:17.283]  It's got to a whore that I had to buy my
[01:59:17.703 --> 01:59:19.404]  ...wife, a $5 bouquet of flowers.
[01:59:19.464 --> 01:59:20.784]  I didn't have the money making these tapes.
[01:59:21.124 --> 01:59:23.945]  But these people that call up in here, they complain to you.
[01:59:24.145 --> 01:59:28.246]  They need to take the $10, $15, $20 and support this show.
[01:59:28.446 --> 01:59:29.647]  You're trying to defend them.
[01:59:29.867 --> 01:59:31.107]  They don't understand this.
[01:59:31.447 --> 01:59:33.648]  They turn off the radio and go look at television.
[01:59:33.828 --> 01:59:34.328]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:59:34.368 --> 01:59:36.689]  This guy was saying he's a patriot, which he isn't.
[01:59:37.569 --> 01:59:41.490]  He's saying he's a patriot and I'm bad because I sell videos.
[01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:44.811]  How would I operate if I didn't sell something?
[01:59:45.351 --> 01:59:45.571]  Right.
[01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:47.232]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:59:47.272 --> 01:59:51.994]  We have a $10,000 a month WWCR shortwave bill.
[01:59:52.514 --> 02:00:07.100]  Almost no money comes in from it because it's an international outreach, but I get letters from people in African villages, and in Malaysian villages, and in China, and in Europe, and people at Antarctic weather stations that are able to hear it.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:09.621]  It does reach millions of people, so I pay
[02:00:09.901 --> 02:00:19.387]  Ten thousand dollars a month to be on there, and usually with Big Berkey sales, five, six thousand of that is paid for through Big Berkeys.
[02:00:19.847 --> 02:00:31.894]  Now if I had them on more, I wouldn't be paying out of my own pocket for it, but I'm so busy covering news that I just cancelled a Big Berkey interview when I believe in that and think people should be drinking good water.
[02:00:33.195 --> 02:00:40.622]  During the last break, so you didn't even know this, Charles, Debbie called in, she's supposed to be on today, and I wanted her on, I said, look, I'm gonna have to cancel you today, because I got all this stuff.
[02:00:42.003 --> 02:00:43.344]  The point is, is I don't like...
[02:00:43.931 --> 02:00:44.792]  Pitching my videos.
[02:00:44.852 --> 02:00:46.393]  I'm sick of it, but they're powerful!
[02:00:46.753 --> 02:00:48.414]  They wake people up, don't they, Charles?
[02:00:48.454 --> 02:00:50.956]  Well, they need to, because they're ignorant half of them.
[02:00:50.976 --> 02:00:52.758]  They want to complain and do nothing about it.
[02:00:53.098 --> 02:00:54.779]  And Forrester Berkey, you could ask Mr. Allen.
[02:00:54.819 --> 02:00:56.180]  Listen, Charles, don't feel bad.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:57.001]  Just work harder.
[02:00:57.041 --> 02:00:57.521]  Look, look.
[02:00:58.242 --> 02:01:02.385]  But people listening to the show, the ones that call in need to support you.
[02:01:02.445 --> 02:01:05.707]  You can bet your bottom dollar that's a big, fat federal informant.
[02:01:05.727 --> 02:01:06.608]  We even know who it is.
[02:01:07.148 --> 02:01:08.548]  Well, God bless you, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:08.568 --> 02:01:11.489]  I'm just sick of people just laying back and making you do it all.
[02:01:11.509 --> 02:01:17.350]  Hey, you ought to be happy that the Feds and their scumbag fellow travelers are angry at us right now.
[02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:18.230]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:19.510]  That's a good sign!
[02:01:19.770 --> 02:01:22.431]  Well, but I'm talking about the people supporting you more.
[02:01:22.771 --> 02:01:24.711]  They need to support you with a few dollars more.
[02:01:24.751 --> 02:01:26.432]  Well, we actually get great support.
[02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:30.752]  It's just that, um, it's just that six employees is expensive.
[02:01:30.832 --> 02:01:31.952]  Well, I just want to say one thing.
[02:01:32.253 --> 02:01:34.493]  I don't want what happened to me
[02:01:35.376 --> 02:01:36.716]  That happened to these people.
[02:01:37.237 --> 02:01:45.259]  They don't understand about really being beaten, stalled, and eaten like baloney and taking all the experiment drugs.
[02:01:45.319 --> 02:01:45.819]  I went through this.
[02:01:45.879 --> 02:01:49.100]  I'm trying to stop them like you from this happening to their children.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.620]  They better get on the ball.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:52.641]  They don't have much time, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:52.861 --> 02:01:55.162]  For the love of God, they need to look in their hearts.
[02:01:56.182 --> 02:01:57.282]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[02:01:57.302 --> 02:01:58.823]  Well, I mean, we got a few seconds left.
[02:01:58.843 --> 02:01:59.603]  Describe
[02:02:01.045 --> 02:02:03.866]  And by the way, every time somebody says they're innocent, they go, oh, you're not innocent.
[02:02:04.146 --> 02:02:07.446]  They admit about 30% of people in jail or prison are innocent.
[02:02:07.946 --> 02:02:09.267]  A lot of them on death row are.
[02:02:09.307 --> 02:02:10.387]  That's being proven all the time.
[02:02:10.747 --> 02:02:12.707]  Charles, they tried to accuse you of something.
[02:02:12.727 --> 02:02:13.208]  They tortured you.
[02:02:13.228 --> 02:02:16.788]  They tried to accuse me of nine things, and the one that could stick, I had nine different charges.
[02:02:17.068 --> 02:02:18.689]  And the one that could stick, they charged me with.
[02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:23.090]  So, it's my hour, probably three hours and thirty-five minutes, Mr. Jones.
[02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:24.270]  They had no evidence.
[02:02:24.610 --> 02:02:27.570]  Three hours and thirty-five minutes, they sentenced me to life in prison.
[02:02:27.871 --> 02:02:29.831]  With three hours and thirty-five minutes.
[02:02:31.661 --> 02:02:32.583]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:02:32.983 --> 02:02:34.646]  I've got a guest coming up and I want to hear about this.
[02:02:35.407 --> 02:02:37.871]  Imagine when they put the bag around your head.
[02:02:38.913 --> 02:02:40.155]  When they start tabling.
[02:02:41.157 --> 02:02:44.262]  They even put it on the local news and say it's good here in Austin.
[02:02:46.531 --> 02:02:53.900]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.181 --> 02:02:58.927]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.147 --> 02:03:04.794]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.034 --> 02:03:16.918]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.958 --> 02:03:21.480]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.161]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.381 --> 02:03:31.103]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:07.645]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:07.885 --> 02:04:13.628]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[02:04:20.431 --> 02:04:24.333]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.

[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:20.840]  We're good to go.
[02:05:47.023 --> 02:05:53.064]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.665 --> 02:05:56.685]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.466 --> 02:06:03.247]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.447 --> 02:06:10.229]  I know that we have folks like Jeff and Melissa and Chris have been holding for a while.
[02:06:10.249 --> 02:06:11.009]  We're going to get to you.
[02:06:12.329 --> 02:06:16.270]  There's just a bunch of other news concerning these nuclear attack drills the government's doing.
[02:06:16.988 --> 02:06:22.090]  The firing of this general and the military openly trying to confiscate our guns all over the country.
[02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:25.531]  I mean, I've been there and videotaped it, but now they just put it on the news.
[02:06:26.152 --> 02:06:28.012]  Oh, we're training to fight American rebels!
[02:06:29.893 --> 02:06:30.934]  I'm even terrorist now.
[02:06:30.974 --> 02:06:33.635]  Well, we fight terror because the rebels might take over.
[02:06:33.795 --> 02:06:34.435]  The rebels.
[02:06:34.875 --> 02:06:38.196]  What are they planning that's so bad that this might happen?
[02:06:38.617 --> 02:06:42.078]  We'll be talking to Dave Workman, who's the Communications Director for a great organization.
[02:06:43.502 --> 02:06:45.563]  The Citizens Committee on the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:06:45.623 --> 02:06:48.365]  Up in Wisconsin, they have gun confiscations in neighborhoods.
[02:06:48.405 --> 02:06:53.689]  If they're looking for a criminal, they just say, everybody out front, out of your houses, lay your guns outside.
[02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:55.650]  No warrant, no nothing.
[02:06:56.470 --> 02:07:04.996]  And their police chiefs have gotten together and it's been on the news, quote, police chiefs across Wisconsin say they need to keep all the guns they can in officers' hands only.
[02:07:05.583 --> 02:07:07.884]  They don't want the citizens being able to have a concealed carry.
[02:07:08.184 --> 02:07:09.204]  That's the government saying.
[02:07:09.565 --> 02:07:11.465]  We don't want you being able to defend yourself.
[02:07:11.926 --> 02:07:12.806]  That's called tyranny.
[02:07:13.146 --> 02:07:14.407]  That's coming up in a minute or two.
[02:07:16.467 --> 02:07:27.832]  But let's go ahead and go back to Charles, who has just done an incredible job as an activist in the last five years, making over 5,000 or 6,000 copies of my videos and other videos.
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:32.761]  And, uh, Charles has woken up a lot of police in his area, you name it.
[02:07:32.781 --> 02:07:36.663]  But, Charles, you woke up the government corruption a little differently than some people.
[02:07:37.823 --> 02:07:39.884]  And, by the way, they say everybody's guilty in prison.
[02:07:39.904 --> 02:07:42.304]  They now have met around 30% are innocent.
[02:07:42.785 --> 02:07:47.346]  Last night, let me just say this, the guy, they kicked the door and a guy shot three policemen here in Baton Rouge.
[02:07:47.406 --> 02:07:48.206]  Just kicking his door.
[02:07:48.266 --> 02:07:49.027]  No search warrant.
[02:07:49.327 --> 02:07:53.028]  Kicked his door open there, and he shot three policemen last night, down here.
[02:07:53.993 --> 02:07:57.976]  They're just kicking doors in down here, saying we don't have to tell you who we're looking for.
[02:07:58.016 --> 02:07:58.577]  We're coming in.
[02:07:58.597 --> 02:08:00.278]  It's happening right here in Louisiana.
[02:08:00.318 --> 02:08:04.321]  Well, I know, and every day they're shooting some innocent person at the wrong house, Peterson.
[02:08:04.542 --> 02:08:06.183]  And I know more and more cops are getting shot.
[02:08:06.243 --> 02:08:07.164]  It's not good for them either.
[02:08:07.444 --> 02:08:08.945]  But these people don't understand.
[02:08:08.985 --> 02:08:12.628]  They better start fighting a little harder, not just listening to this radio, Mr. Jones.
[02:08:12.888 --> 02:08:15.030]  What's going to happen to them?
[02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:19.914]  Well, I want you to describe for people, in a nutshell, in about a minute and a half, because then we're going to go to our guest, Charles.
[02:08:20.603 --> 02:08:21.624]  How you got picked up?
[02:08:21.744 --> 02:08:22.645]  How you got tortured?
[02:08:22.666 --> 02:08:23.727]  What happened to you in prison?
[02:08:23.907 --> 02:08:24.708]  They had a shootout.
[02:08:24.748 --> 02:08:30.755]  I was in a ball with a lady and we walked outside about 15 minutes later and a guy was laying in.
[02:08:30.795 --> 02:08:32.998]  I said, we're going to see if he's living.
[02:08:33.038 --> 02:08:35.881]  So I walked up there, me and three or four of them, and we left.
[02:08:36.414 --> 02:08:37.555]  We left, the guy was dead.
[02:08:37.875 --> 02:08:40.016]  They picked me up about a block away.
[02:08:40.036 --> 02:08:40.857]  They said, was you up there?
[02:08:40.877 --> 02:08:41.857]  I said, yes I was.
[02:08:42.217 --> 02:08:43.338]  I heard the shots and all that.
[02:08:43.358 --> 02:08:45.219]  They said, we got a witness saying you was on the scene.
[02:08:45.259 --> 02:08:47.540]  I said, they had 60 people on the scene.
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.281]  They said, well come on, let me talk to you.
[02:08:49.642 --> 02:08:51.623]  So after a while, they got my address.
[02:08:51.643 --> 02:08:54.524]  Went in there, they found a .357 Magnum that I had at home.
[02:08:54.604 --> 02:08:55.645]  It was a highway patrolman.
[02:08:55.865 --> 02:08:56.746]  They said, is this your gun?
[02:08:56.786 --> 02:08:57.486]  I said, yes it is.
[02:08:57.506 --> 02:09:00.568]  They said, well this is the gun that was used into the crime.
[02:09:01.236 --> 02:09:02.837]  I didn't come to find out there was no ballistics.
[02:09:02.857 --> 02:09:04.158]  The bullet went past her, the guy.
[02:09:04.538 --> 02:09:06.239]  Anyway, I started saying, no, no, no.
[02:09:06.259 --> 02:09:08.261]  They put the bag over my head three or four times.
[02:09:08.621 --> 02:09:13.824]  And then they said I signed other charges, but I don't remember because I was kind of out of it, you know.
[02:09:13.844 --> 02:09:15.525]  They kept the bag on me too long.
[02:09:16.005 --> 02:09:17.506]  No, no, that's what the Russians do.
[02:09:17.526 --> 02:09:18.747]  That's our government's favorite.
[02:09:18.967 --> 02:09:19.788]  And I went to trial.
[02:09:19.848 --> 02:09:21.649]  It lasted three hours and thirty-five minutes.
[02:09:21.729 --> 02:09:23.330]  All they had was a guy saying, leave me seat.
[02:09:25.279 --> 02:09:27.460]  Of the scene of the crime, but six other people left it.
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:31.042]  But I was the only one that somebody spotted, because I hid it.
[02:09:31.082 --> 02:09:34.624]  I mean, they admit now with DNA and all the rest of it, about 30% roughly.
[02:09:35.084 --> 02:09:40.367]  It's different in different states, but 25 to 35% on average, around 30, are totally innocent.
[02:09:40.427 --> 02:09:47.871]  Listen, man, I have stolen a candy bar when I was about three, and I have stolen beer out of somebody's garage.
[02:09:48.701 --> 02:09:50.382]  And boy, I got cured of it.
[02:09:50.902 --> 02:09:53.663]  Obviously, you're 14 years old, you want beer, you can't get beer.
[02:09:56.403 --> 02:10:03.766]  Somebody had their garage door open, and one of my friends, who was not the best kind of friend to have, said, let's get that case of beer sitting right there on that refrigerator.
[02:10:04.506 --> 02:10:09.447]  And we went in and got it, and the door opens, and the guy starts chasing us.
[02:10:10.107 --> 02:10:11.228]  And boy, that cured me.
[02:10:11.768 --> 02:10:15.309]  But the point is, I still had our corrupt police.
[02:10:16.624 --> 02:10:18.144]  Pull me out of public school.
[02:10:18.164 --> 02:10:20.185]  This is before we moved down to Austin, but I was in high school then.
[02:10:20.545 --> 02:10:23.966]  Pull me out of class and go, we know you're stealing stereo equipment.
[02:10:24.386 --> 02:10:27.027]  You're the mastermind over stereo equipment thieving.
[02:10:27.827 --> 02:10:29.468]  And I mean, I was just like, what are you talking about?
[02:10:29.528 --> 02:10:30.828]  So, believe me, I know.
[02:10:31.748 --> 02:10:33.589]  And it happens all the time.
[02:10:33.809 --> 02:10:36.890]  And listen, I've seen the videos where the cops don't know a video got shot.
[02:10:37.290 --> 02:10:38.370]  Or somebody's quiet about it.
[02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:39.590]  I mean, this happened in Austin.
[02:10:40.931 --> 02:10:43.451]  Or we subpoena the original tape and get it when they've already edited one.
[02:10:44.392 --> 02:10:45.312]  They will sit there
[02:10:46.230 --> 02:10:49.453]  And, I'm not saying all of them, but definitely bad cadres, folks.
[02:10:50.614 --> 02:10:52.455]  They'll beat you, and you don't even resist.
[02:10:52.475 --> 02:10:53.996]  Well, I've got Abby Neumann on video.
[02:10:54.016 --> 02:10:56.198]  She doesn't resist, and they've charged her with resisting.
[02:10:56.918 --> 02:11:05.585]  But, I mean, grown men ball up as the cops kick them and beat them, and then the cops charge you with assaulting them!
[02:11:05.605 --> 02:11:10.809]  I mean, think of not having the conscience of wanting to send an innocent person to prison!
[02:11:11.249 --> 02:11:13.831]  I mean, you get like five years for assaulting a cop,
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:19.746]  And, uh, no, no, that's the new... I mean, even if you ball up, a lot of them will charge you.
[02:11:20.066 --> 02:11:21.607]  Because then they gotta protect themselves.
[02:11:21.648 --> 02:11:22.448]  I mean, that's sick.
[02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:23.670]  But, but, but, finish up.
[02:11:23.690 --> 02:11:24.591]  What happened to you in prison?
[02:11:25.191 --> 02:11:30.557]  Oh, well, I went 17 years and something, and Governor Edwards looked into my case and freed me.
[02:11:31.064 --> 02:11:34.707]  I had a life sentence, but Governor Everson, I heard about this case, and he freed me.
[02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:36.248]  This is God Almighty's truth.
[02:11:36.508 --> 02:11:37.649]  The Governor of Louisiana.
[02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:42.052]  Well, you don't know this, Charles, but I've actually been sending news articles about you by listeners, and you call into a lot of the shows.
[02:11:42.072 --> 02:11:45.794]  People know who you are, and I've talked to people that live in your town about what you've done.
[02:11:45.814 --> 02:11:49.477]  I actually have some distant family that lives near you.
[02:11:50.538 --> 02:11:52.759]  And you've also sent me photos of you and your lovely wife.
[02:11:52.799 --> 02:11:55.841]  You were such a good guy, and you've never had any trouble in your life.
[02:11:55.882 --> 02:12:00.024]  I wonder how those cops feel putting an innocent man in prison.
[02:12:01.906 --> 02:12:07.190]  I don't know, but I've seen them rape a boy because he fought back and they said, we're going to show you you're not a man of the day.
[02:12:07.210 --> 02:12:07.971]  And they shackled him.
[02:12:08.231 --> 02:12:10.493]  And so help me God, Mr. Jones, I'll never forget that.
[02:12:10.674 --> 02:12:11.594]  He was across the cell.
[02:12:11.615 --> 02:12:14.898]  They actually raped one of the prisoners.
[02:12:15.098 --> 02:12:15.818]  I've seen this!
[02:12:16.039 --> 02:12:18.601]  So help me God, it stays in my mind all the time.
[02:12:18.621 --> 02:12:21.343]  They did it because he fought back and they raped him.
[02:12:21.363 --> 02:12:23.345]  Three of them held him and raped him, I swear.
[02:12:23.986 --> 02:12:25.027]  And I don't want this to happen.
[02:12:25.067 --> 02:12:26.989]  And they raped children in Abu Ghraib.
[02:12:28.078 --> 02:12:29.959]  I don't want this to happen to people.
[02:12:29.979 --> 02:12:30.679]  That's admitted.
[02:12:30.699 --> 02:12:31.840]  That's in the Army's own report.
[02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:35.762]  Raping children is what we've turned into.
[02:12:35.802 --> 02:12:37.543]  Well, Charles, God bless you.
[02:12:37.583 --> 02:12:38.683]  You just keep fighting evil, my friend.
[02:12:38.703 --> 02:12:38.923]  Thank you.
[02:12:38.943 --> 02:12:39.664]  And please call us.
[02:12:39.704 --> 02:12:40.464]  Support the show.
[02:12:40.564 --> 02:12:41.805]  Please, for the love of God.
[02:12:42.005 --> 02:12:42.345]  Please.
[02:12:42.405 --> 02:12:43.165]  Well, thank you, Charles.
[02:12:43.185 --> 02:12:43.866]  You're very sweet.
[02:12:43.906 --> 02:12:44.306]  Take care.
[02:12:44.786 --> 02:12:45.547]  What a great guy.
[02:12:46.187 --> 02:12:47.407]  I apologize to our guest.
[02:12:49.348 --> 02:12:50.389]  He's Dave Workman.
[02:12:51.201 --> 02:12:56.423]  And we'll also plug the website for the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.
[02:12:56.443 --> 02:12:57.984]  We're talking about tyranny, folks.
[02:12:58.544 --> 02:13:00.085]  And we've got this quote by the news.
[02:13:00.125 --> 02:13:05.567]  Police chiefs across Wisconsin say they need to keep all the guns they can in officers' hands only.
[02:13:06.368 --> 02:13:07.808]  And, Dave, thanks for coming on.
[02:13:08.128 --> 02:13:09.569]  Well, I'm very kind of you to have me, Alex.
[02:13:09.609 --> 02:13:10.789]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[02:13:11.610 --> 02:13:11.910]  You bet.
[02:13:12.865 --> 02:13:15.846]  I mean, Wisconsin's getting really bad, but so is the rest of the country.
[02:13:16.386 --> 02:13:19.908]  What's this latest development where they don't want the citizens to have concealed carry?
[02:13:20.168 --> 02:13:36.874]  Well, as you probably know, and as your listeners probably know, Wisconsin is one of only four states in the country that does not have some kind of a statute that provides for concealed carry by private citizens who are properly licensed.
[02:13:36.914 --> 02:13:39.715]  However they go through each state is just a little bit different.
[02:13:40.553 --> 02:13:52.624]  The Wisconsin police chiefs have been fighting tooth and nail, literally, for a couple of years now, efforts by
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:14:06.848]  certain members of the state legislature to bring forth a concealed carry law in the state that would allow Wisconsin citizens the same right to self-protection as citizens in 46 other states.
[02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:20.596]  When the Citizens Committee saw this newsflash from WBAY-TV up in Green Bay where it said the police chiefs across Wisconsin say they need to keep all the guns they can in officers' hands only,
[02:14:21.817 --> 02:14:24.738]  That was just an astonishing revelation to us.
[02:14:26.538 --> 02:14:36.900]  We look at this and we know that across the country there are so many good cops out there who are fully supportive of the citizen's right to keep and gun control.
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.761]  Yeah, I mean it sounds like we're cop bashing earlier.
[02:14:38.801 --> 02:14:39.541]  It's the system.
[02:14:39.561 --> 02:14:47.822]  To be clear, they had a big national poll of police officers two years ago and what, 90-something percent are against any gun control?
[02:14:47.922 --> 02:14:50.403]  But the police chiefs are politicians.
[02:14:50.883 --> 02:14:52.104]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:52.244 --> 02:15:01.292]  And the police chiefs, unlike, say, county sheriffs, for example, police chiefs are appointed to their positions by anti-gun politicians.
[02:15:01.472 --> 02:15:04.975]  And trust me on this, you're no dummy, I'm no dummy.
[02:15:05.475 --> 02:15:11.420]  If your boss tells you that you're going to say guns are bad, you're going to say guns are bad because you don't want to lose that $90,000 a year job.
[02:15:13.771 --> 02:15:28.711]  Uh, and I think a lot of this in Wisconsin is, uh, well it might be elitism on the part of some of these police chiefs because having that firearm and that badge is a, it's maybe a status symbol, but
[02:15:29.361 --> 02:15:37.847]  Still, statistics and available data show... Crime drops by about 20% three years after a concealed carry.
[02:15:38.088 --> 02:15:44.392]  Legally armed private citizens are not the enemy of the police, they're the best friends the cops have.
[02:15:44.412 --> 02:15:50.016]  Well, the number I've got is about 20% depending on which state, but what's the numbers you've got a few years after a concealed carry?
[02:15:50.177 --> 02:15:55.901]  Well, again, it depends on the state, but you can look at some of the data and
[02:15:56.301 --> 02:15:58.904]  Yeah, and it's been historically demonstrated time and again
[02:16:15.925 --> 02:16:31.492]  When it is highly publicized that private citizens are arming themselves against, say, robbery, if women arm themselves against rape, against all kinds of violent crime, criminal activity drops as a result of that.
[02:16:31.532 --> 02:16:39.055]  And then they openly, just like homeless will all move to a city where it's good for the homeless, criminals will move to cities where people are disarmed.
[02:16:40.598 --> 02:16:47.704]  Well, there's certainly evidence to indicate that, because they certainly don't hang around where they might get shot by their next intended target.
[02:16:47.744 --> 02:16:50.867]  They don't hang around in Kennesaw, Georgia where you got on a gun by law?
[02:16:51.207 --> 02:16:51.847]  Absolutely.
[02:16:53.609 --> 02:16:56.831]  I'm talking to you right now from the state of Washington, and up here we have
[02:16:57.712 --> 02:17:04.740]  At last count, I think something like 240,000 licensed citizens to carry concealed firearms in the state.
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:18.614]  And Washington is, I think, fifth in the country in terms of the number of people licensed to carry relating to the overall population, the per capita population.
[02:17:19.114 --> 02:17:27.539]  Now, our question to the Chiefs of Police in Wisconsin is, what's different between your citizens and our citizens?
[02:17:27.919 --> 02:17:32.682]  If the police out here think it's okay for us to carry guns, what the hell is wrong with you guys?
[02:17:32.842 --> 02:17:34.943]  Well, I agree with you, Dave Workman.
[02:17:34.983 --> 02:17:35.623]  Please stay with us.
[02:17:35.683 --> 02:17:39.545]  I want to give out the website on the other side for this great national organization.
[02:17:39.565 --> 02:17:44.328]  And we need to expose this and put these police chiefs' feet to the fire.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:53.022]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:17:53.242 --> 02:17:57.284]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:17:57.524 --> 02:17:59.664]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:18:00.024 --> 02:18:02.005]  All natural Non-X clears out the soil.
[02:18:02.005 --> 02:18:02.265]  Of course!
[02:18:22.995 --> 02:18:23.255]  I think so.
[02:18:47.702 --> 02:18:48.742]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:18:49.063 --> 02:18:51.864]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:52.124 --> 02:18:56.265]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.706 --> 02:18:57.546]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.846 --> 02:19:02.428]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.908 --> 02:19:05.029]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:05.529 --> 02:19:06.409]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:19:06.809 --> 02:19:10.530]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[02:19:45.794 --> 02:19:51.996]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:52.456 --> 02:20:00.238]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:20:00.579 --> 02:20:08.421]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:08.741 --> 02:20:13.505]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:20:13.825 --> 02:20:18.549]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:20:19.050 --> 02:20:22.913]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[02:21:48.004 --> 02:22:04.119]  This is our final segment with Dave Workman, who's the Communications Director, Media Man, with a great national organization that deserves our support, ccrkba.org is the website, Citizens Committee, for the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:12.386]  And, you know, they're out there time and time again really exposing how bad things are getting around this country for the Second Amendment.
[02:22:12.426 --> 02:22:14.308]  We're having victories, but we're also having defeats.
[02:22:15.235 --> 02:22:25.099]  But Dave, I mean, how do we put pressure on these police chiefs that are grandstanding and demonizing the Second Amendment and saying, we don't want the citizens having guns?
[02:22:25.979 --> 02:22:44.026]  I think probably the best place to start is for the citizens in those Wisconsin communities to start showing up at city council meetings, at county commission meetings, to start writing letters to the editor, to be out front with the local TV and radio stations.
[02:22:44.938 --> 02:22:52.001]  They've got to show and they've got to demonstrate that responsible citizens go through the hoops.
[02:22:52.521 --> 02:22:54.242]  They get their concealed pistol license.
[02:22:55.282 --> 02:23:02.185]  It's not the licensed gun carrier in 99% of these cases that is the problem.
[02:23:02.225 --> 02:23:04.726]  It's the outlaw who's already carrying a gun illegally.
[02:23:05.505 --> 02:23:12.512]  And the police chiefs just seem to lump us all into the same breadbasket there in Wisconsin.
[02:23:13.033 --> 02:23:14.134]  I don't understand that.
[02:23:15.675 --> 02:23:22.702]  There are a lot of good people in Wisconsin who have every right to defend themselves outside the boundaries of their own homes.
[02:23:23.103 --> 02:23:25.645]  Why are these police chiefs standing in the way of that?
[02:23:25.946 --> 02:23:27.507]  What's wrong with these people that
[02:23:28.823 --> 02:23:30.804]  These top cops don't trust them.
[02:23:45.323 --> 02:23:55.368]  That was up in Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, where the city council, a city manager, wanted to declare martial law.
[02:23:55.408 --> 02:23:56.429]  Did you ever hear about that?
[02:23:56.449 --> 02:23:58.950]  I vaguely remember that, yes.
[02:23:59.170 --> 02:24:01.151]  Well, people are suing us and criticizing us.
[02:24:01.451 --> 02:24:03.632]  We can just declare martial law and arrest them.
[02:24:04.032 --> 02:24:06.214]  Folks, that's actually in my film, Police State 3.
[02:24:07.214 --> 02:24:08.835]  I'm not joking, that's the headline.
[02:24:09.395 --> 02:24:13.579]  I mean, I think it's a mentality of some people that we're their slaves.
[02:24:13.619 --> 02:24:15.220]  I mean, you can say, well, maybe they're just dumb.
[02:24:15.461 --> 02:24:16.362]  They're not dumb.
[02:24:16.402 --> 02:24:21.066]  They know that it makes everybody safer and that criminals don't follow law.
[02:24:21.306 --> 02:24:28.833]  Well, they had a silly situation up here in Pierce County, Washington, where the Pierce County Council had passed an ordinance
[02:24:29.409 --> 02:24:38.176]  Prohibiting citizens from coming in and criticizing members of the council during public comment periods.
[02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:41.618]  Well, that didn't last long because the citizens down there had a fit.
[02:24:43.039 --> 02:24:46.482]  They took legal action.
[02:24:46.942 --> 02:24:51.566]  The council is now going to rescind that ordinance if they haven't already.
[02:24:52.186 --> 02:25:02.957]  And what does that say to you about government agents, whether they're elected officials or whether they're police chiefs, who stand up and say, you know, the citizens
[02:25:03.490 --> 02:25:05.131]  We don't want to hear complaints from them.
[02:25:05.171 --> 02:25:06.752]  We don't want to hear their criticism.
[02:25:06.852 --> 02:25:14.157]  We don't want to have... Well, what Austin does is... Austin got a law passed where you gotta sign up a week before and jump through 14 hoops.
[02:25:14.557 --> 02:25:14.937]  No, no, no.
[02:25:15.097 --> 02:25:20.521]  They don't want to hear... And I've seen similar stuff around the country where they just say, no citizens communication.
[02:25:20.781 --> 02:25:23.222]  I mean, that's government saying, we're God.
[02:25:24.263 --> 02:25:26.264]  I wonder if they've ever heard of the First Amendment.
[02:25:27.305 --> 02:25:27.645]  Whatever?
[02:25:27.685 --> 02:25:29.046]  Well, I guess they haven't heard of the Second either.
[02:25:29.166 --> 02:25:30.587]  I wonder what happened to the Oscars.
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:35.621]  Whatever happened with the Oshkosh gun confiscation?
[02:25:35.941 --> 02:25:39.402]  Actually, that story was covered in Gun Week.
[02:25:39.482 --> 02:25:43.682]  I covered that story, and I'm afraid that that story was blown out of proportion.
[02:25:45.103 --> 02:25:49.224]  They found one house with some guns, and they took the guns out of the house.
[02:25:50.184 --> 02:25:51.584]  They gave the guns back to the guy.
[02:25:51.604 --> 02:25:53.144]  They apologized to the guy.
[02:25:53.484 --> 02:25:56.105]  There was not, as far as I can determine,
[02:25:56.892 --> 02:25:59.294]  A massive neighborhood gun confiscation.
[02:25:59.314 --> 02:26:04.058]  Well, that was the fault of the local TV station because I read their report on air.
[02:26:04.138 --> 02:26:09.563]  Yeah, yeah, and believe me, do you trust everything you see in print or read?
[02:26:09.903 --> 02:26:10.384]  No, I don't.
[02:26:10.404 --> 02:26:12.365]  Well, that's good news then.
[02:26:13.506 --> 02:26:17.610]  And I'm actually proud that Gun Week was up front with that because
[02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:19.750]  We've earned a reputation.
[02:26:19.810 --> 02:26:21.751]  I'm the senior editor of Gun Week, by the way.
[02:26:21.771 --> 02:26:22.791]  No, I've read it before, yeah.
[02:26:23.251 --> 02:26:28.333]  And we've earned a reputation for telling the truth, telling it like it is, with good, bad, or indifferent.
[02:26:29.153 --> 02:26:42.976]  And I'll tell you, the spookiest thing that ever happened to me since I came aboard Gun Week, last year during the debates against the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in the Senate, Ted Kennedy got up and quoted something out of Gun Week.
[02:26:43.457 --> 02:26:44.437]  I just about fell over.
[02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.851]  That's amazing.
[02:26:47.131 --> 02:26:48.072]  Oh yeah!
[02:26:48.092 --> 02:26:49.573]  Give us the Gun Week website.
[02:26:50.034 --> 02:26:56.440]  www.gunweek.com You can't forget that, gunweek.com.
[02:26:57.481 --> 02:27:04.527]  Dave Workman, in the last 30 seconds, do you think we're winning the fight for the Second Amendment, or are we losing it like we were a few years ago?
[02:27:04.828 --> 02:27:09.031]  I think we're just holding our own, but I think the pendulum is swinging back in our direction.
[02:27:09.452 --> 02:27:11.574]  People are waking up, they're going to understand that
[02:27:12.074 --> 02:27:17.758]  It's not good people with guns that are the problem, it's bad people that are the problem, whether they have guns or not.
[02:27:18.178 --> 02:27:20.659]  Yeah, they'll use a Louisville Slugger or a Ginsu knife.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:21.620]  You betcha.
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:27.924]  Alright, well thank you for coming on with that update about these police chiefs and we'll try to expose them.
[02:27:27.964 --> 02:27:28.464]  Thank you Dave.
[02:27:28.484 --> 02:27:30.245]  Stay on top of it Alex, you take care.
[02:27:30.506 --> 02:27:31.046]  God bless you.
[02:27:36.304 --> 02:27:37.186]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.688 --> 02:27:39.291]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.213 --> 02:27:42.899]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.616 --> 02:27:52.980]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.203]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.523 --> 02:28:06.428]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.588 --> 02:28:13.632]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.832 --> 02:28:15.054]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:15.214 --> 02:28:18.598]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.659 --> 02:28:19.780]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:21.342]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.542 --> 02:28:28.371]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:29:47.694 --> 02:29:54.542]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:29:54.822 --> 02:29:57.184]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:29:57.425 --> 02:29:59.387]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:29:59.727 --> 02:30:05.093]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:30:05.473 --> 02:30:09.736]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:30:10.196 --> 02:30:12.718]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[02:30:12.938 --> 02:30:18.101]  With its 10 year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[02:30:18.281 --> 02:30:23.325]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:30:23.365 --> 02:30:25.366]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[02:30:26.066 --> 02:30:28.588]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:28.608 --> 02:30:31.730]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.194 --> 02:31:00.997]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight central.
[02:31:01.538 --> 02:31:02.819]  I'm sorry to Melissa who hung up.
[02:31:02.839 --> 02:31:05.481]  She's been patiently holding for about an hour.
[02:31:05.561 --> 02:31:08.403]  I never got to her because the phones are always loaded here.
[02:31:08.423 --> 02:31:10.265]  We've got a lot of guests and information.
[02:31:10.845 --> 02:31:13.087]  Jeff, Brian, Ron, Will, and Kay.
[02:31:13.487 --> 02:31:17.911]  We will get to all of you in the next 26 minutes that we got left in this broadcast.
[02:31:17.971 --> 02:31:19.572]  And I got some other news I want to hit on.
[02:31:20.033 --> 02:31:21.054]  We will get to everybody.
[02:31:21.934 --> 02:31:23.716]  But for the next five minutes,
[02:31:25.029 --> 02:31:27.030]  The next five 60-second intervals.
[02:31:27.491 --> 02:31:29.612]  Haven't had him on in about four months.
[02:31:30.493 --> 02:31:32.374]  Gotta have him on once a season, I guess.
[02:31:33.155 --> 02:31:36.997]  And I got to thinking earlier in the last hour, hey, we ought to support the network, too.
[02:31:37.698 --> 02:31:40.880]  And the biggest sponsor of the network is Midas Resources.
[02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:43.362]  Been around for, what, over a decade.
[02:31:43.962 --> 02:31:45.843]  And I have, that's where, I've shopped.
[02:31:45.903 --> 02:31:46.444]  I'm a shopper.
[02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:47.885]  And I bought a little bit of gold.
[02:31:48.945 --> 02:31:53.968]  Uh, you know, kind of like my kids, uh, insurance policy or whatever, uh, for college or whatever.
[02:31:53.988 --> 02:31:58.531]  When I bought a little bit of gold, I shopped around, and they weren't the cheapest, but they weren't the most expensive.
[02:31:58.931 --> 02:32:00.813]  They were below the mid-mark.
[02:32:00.873 --> 02:32:04.575]  I mean, you could find it cheaper other places, but you don't know these are good companies.
[02:32:05.348 --> 02:32:06.108]  They did a great job.
[02:32:06.128 --> 02:32:08.109]  I've had a family that's bought gold from them.
[02:32:08.589 --> 02:32:09.450]  I've got great deals.
[02:32:10.090 --> 02:32:15.752]  And, well, Ted Anderson also owns the Genesis Network that always needs your support.
[02:32:16.173 --> 02:32:17.553]  We're growing by leaps and bounds.
[02:32:17.593 --> 02:32:18.874]  Getting a lot of new affiliates.
[02:32:19.374 --> 02:32:21.515]  A lot of really exciting things that are happening.
[02:32:21.655 --> 02:32:26.837]  I don't know if Ted wants to talk about that, but we're very close to XM Radio.
[02:32:27.457 --> 02:32:29.098]  Very, very close to Dish Network.
[02:32:30.038 --> 02:32:33.079]  I've been working on that for several years, but it looks like it may happen then.
[02:32:33.099 --> 02:32:35.280]  I mean, that's really going to be huge.
[02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:37.500]  20 million homes in America with this network, folks.
[02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:40.801]  And that's a great... And then with Grass Ridge, we can spread the word.
[02:32:40.841 --> 02:32:41.801]  We're very close.
[02:32:42.842 --> 02:32:44.842]  But you've got to support the network.
[02:32:45.562 --> 02:32:49.984]  And Chad, it's... I'll tell you, oil prices are exploding.
[02:32:50.284 --> 02:32:50.944]  Gold is up.
[02:32:51.883 --> 02:32:55.487]  You know, when gold really goes up, I don't dump the gold I bought three or four years ago.
[02:32:55.527 --> 02:32:57.148]  I don't dump the gold I bought a year ago.
[02:32:57.549 --> 02:32:58.710]  I just hold on to it, Ted.
[02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:59.791]  Is that smart or stupid?
[02:32:59.991 --> 02:33:02.253]  Well, no, I think that's very smart at this time.
[02:33:02.313 --> 02:33:08.599]  I mean, there's obviously big problems out there in the world economy, not just here in the United States, but you take a look at it.
[02:33:08.639 --> 02:33:11.662]  I know Best Buy is looking at laying off a whole bunch of people right now.
[02:33:12.003 --> 02:33:14.045]  There's a lot of big companies that have been doing that.
[02:33:15.265 --> 02:33:26.592]  There's just so many economic events, it just doesn't take, you know, you don't have to turn very far to find good reasons to buy gold, but obviously one of the main reasons right now is the cost of fuel.
[02:33:27.113 --> 02:33:37.259]  Cost of fuel is about transportation, and transportation is the food that you eat, the clothing that you wear, about anything that you buy gets transported by some truck,
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.982]  By some truck or train or boat or something like that.
[02:33:41.703 --> 02:33:44.586]  The cost of fuel going up like it is causing inflation.
[02:33:44.606 --> 02:33:46.448]  We're having inflation here in the United States.
[02:33:46.868 --> 02:33:48.210]  Gold took a big jump today.
[02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:50.172]  It was up as high as $11 today.
[02:33:50.352 --> 02:33:50.852]  Right now it's at $8.70.
[02:33:53.289 --> 02:33:56.792]  I mean, it's up a percent.
[02:33:56.832 --> 02:33:58.273]  It's up 2% today.
[02:33:59.233 --> 02:34:04.177]  Many people don't get that kind of return on their savings accounts or what they have in a year.
[02:34:04.377 --> 02:34:05.618]  In an entire year.
[02:34:05.678 --> 02:34:07.799]  I have a little savings account.
[02:34:07.819 --> 02:34:09.420]  I think it's like half a percent or something.
[02:34:11.041 --> 02:34:11.481]  Yeah, I know.
[02:34:11.842 --> 02:34:12.842]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:34:14.415 --> 02:34:15.476]  That's the funny thing about it.
[02:34:15.516 --> 02:34:18.538]  People are definitely losing by putting their money in the bank.
[02:34:18.978 --> 02:34:28.364]  Now, real estate prices up here in the Minneapolis area have just skyrocketed across the last couple of years, but now houses are sitting in the market for almost nine months.
[02:34:28.444 --> 02:34:29.245]  Total bubble.
[02:34:29.765 --> 02:34:32.987]  And people are upside down in them, so they've got to keep them for sale.
[02:34:33.187 --> 02:34:40.392]  So here you have a situation where the real estate market is topping off the stock and bond market.
[02:34:40.432 --> 02:34:41.773]  Nobody trusts that anymore.
[02:34:42.193 --> 02:34:43.434]  Well, I mean, Ted, let's look at the past.
[02:34:43.514 --> 02:34:49.599]  I mean, what, gold went up, I mean, the last five years, what, is gold up like 60-something percent?
[02:34:49.679 --> 02:34:53.882]  Oh, yeah, because we're up from 200, I think the bottom, I could have sold gold for $240 an ounce.
[02:34:53.902 --> 02:34:55.704]  Yeah, I bought some then, yeah.
[02:34:55.744 --> 02:35:05.832]  Yeah, and it's up, it's up incredibly, and the thing is, is that gold is a world monetary unit, just like oil is a world energy.
[02:35:06.212 --> 02:35:18.325]  They've artificially kept it down, but when you see an inflationary spike in currencies and petrochemicals, it's going to cause in the aggregate an increase in all other major benchmarks or commodities.
[02:35:18.945 --> 02:35:24.131]  Including gold, because even the cost to produce amounts of gold is going to go up.
[02:35:25.812 --> 02:35:29.755]  I mean, every six months or so, I buy a few coins from it, because I'm not rolling in cash here.
[02:35:30.015 --> 02:35:35.318]  But I buy a few coins, and over time, that builds up into a nice little cachet of coins.
[02:35:35.879 --> 02:35:39.301]  And gold's been worth the same thing for 6,000 years.
[02:35:39.841 --> 02:35:42.343]  So how do folks... Well, you've got three different
[02:35:42.915 --> 02:35:46.476]  Yeah, plus also don't forget they have a finite supply, and that's one of the things too.
[02:35:46.516 --> 02:35:48.337]  They don't manufacture coins from the 1800s anymore.
[02:36:06.843 --> 02:36:08.769]  What I have is I have $20 Liberties.
[02:36:09.049 --> 02:36:10.052]  People have heard about them.
[02:36:10.092 --> 02:36:11.577]  They're the double legal type coin.
[02:36:11.617 --> 02:36:12.279]  They're at $603 apiece.
[02:36:14.276 --> 02:36:25.262]  And that's a great coin to have because of the fact that you get a lot of gold, close to belt value, but I also have the $10 gold pieces right now, and they're $2.84, and that's the $10 Liberty.
[02:36:25.482 --> 02:36:26.743]  Each of those... That's a good deal!
[02:36:27.023 --> 02:36:32.526]  Oh, going back in the 1700s and the early, I mean 1700s, that'd be great.
[02:36:32.826 --> 02:36:34.087]  1800s to early 1900s.
[02:36:34.127 --> 02:36:40.350]  Then I also have, that you mentioned to me, that smaller gold coins would make a lot of sense, and I do have the $5 Liberty as well.
[02:36:41.611 --> 02:36:43.755]  And they're at $180 apiece.
[02:36:44.035 --> 02:36:47.480]  I mean, gold right now is at $445.30.
[02:36:47.941 --> 02:36:52.848]  That puts gold at one of the highest points that it's been since its last peak.
[02:36:53.289 --> 02:36:57.235]  And that, you know... But you've already bought this gold, so you're selling it at previous prices.
[02:36:57.515 --> 02:36:57.755]  I am.
[02:36:57.816 --> 02:37:02.060]  As a matter of fact, I accumulated this position when gold was at about $4.25.
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:09.387]  My next prices that come in in the next material after I get these sold, my next prices on $20 gold pieces are at $6.25.
[02:37:09.768 --> 02:37:11.109]  Those were at $6.03.
[02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:14.152]  My next price on $20 Liberty is very fine.
[02:37:15.374 --> 02:37:17.596]  Every time this happens, I say I'm going to buy some.
[02:37:17.656 --> 02:37:18.096]  I never do.
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:23.003]  Well, it's one of those times, I mean, you just have that... I mean, it's obvious.
[02:37:23.063 --> 02:37:25.645]  I mean, we're seeing oil prices peak out.
[02:37:25.685 --> 02:37:29.188]  I'm not saying that oil prices can't come back down again, but we know what the trend is.
[02:37:29.528 --> 02:37:31.910]  Well, we know Henry Kissinger said it's going to hit 120.
[02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:34.812]  Now, Katie barred the door, folks.
[02:37:35.252 --> 02:37:43.719]  I hope in the next year and a half, as Kissinger said, that's from two separate reporters who had three separate sources apiece, Daniel Estolan and, of course, Jim Tucker.
[02:37:43.759 --> 02:37:46.001]  And, unfortunately, everything Tucker says comes true.
[02:37:46.401 --> 02:37:48.363]  And, look, I hope Kissinger's wrong this time.
[02:37:48.863 --> 02:37:54.467]  But I mean, you could set the date of this fall of the Soviet Union by Tucker, a year before, because he heard it in Bilderberg.
[02:37:54.807 --> 02:37:59.189]  He said, we're not invading in March of 2002, it's March of 2003, and boom, it happens.
[02:37:59.530 --> 02:38:02.111]  When the Washington Post was saying it was that month in 2002.
[02:38:02.731 --> 02:38:05.993]  So I don't know if that's true, but regardless, it's already out of control.
[02:38:06.294 --> 02:38:11.637]  I mean, look, we already have a 94% increase in the price of oil in the last two years.
[02:38:13.115 --> 02:38:13.295]  Yeah.
[02:38:13.555 --> 02:38:15.696]  So, so, so, I know it's overnight.
[02:38:15.736 --> 02:38:23.400]  Yeah, well, I think, gosh, it sure seems like I could have bought a gallon of gasoline for a buck twenty-nine here not too long ago.
[02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:26.222]  I'm talking about two years ago, what it was at the wellhead.
[02:38:26.852 --> 02:38:27.653]  Yeah.
[02:38:27.813 --> 02:38:29.194]  And we've almost had a doubling.
[02:38:29.634 --> 02:38:33.096]  Yeah, because right now I'm looking at $2.55 here in Minneapolis.
[02:38:33.136 --> 02:38:35.938]  You were saying it's $2.45 or something like that in Texas?
[02:38:36.339 --> 02:38:37.139]  Yeah.
[02:38:37.579 --> 02:38:41.362]  And obviously we have to travel a little further from the well ourselves to get it.
[02:38:41.502 --> 02:38:44.624]  I'm talking about per barrel cost.
[02:38:44.704 --> 02:38:45.605]  It's almost doubled.
[02:38:45.785 --> 02:38:46.606]  Yeah, I would say.
[02:38:46.626 --> 02:38:47.806]  I would say that's about right.
[02:38:47.826 --> 02:38:48.887]  And we're talking about a doubling.
[02:38:48.927 --> 02:38:50.849]  I'm not trying to... Whatever, folks.
[02:38:50.929 --> 02:38:51.609]  Gold is real.
[02:38:51.649 --> 02:38:52.450]  Everybody knows that.
[02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:54.291]  And, Ted, give them the number.
[02:38:55.436 --> 02:39:08.585]  The number is 1-800-686-2237 and Alex, I've had since this satellite change with Stars Encore, I've had about a hundred people call us asking us, how are you going to do it?
[02:39:08.645 --> 02:39:10.086]  How can I help with this kind of thing?
[02:39:10.126 --> 02:39:17.251]  One of the easiest ways to help Genesis Communications Network is by ordering precious metals from Midas Resources.
[02:39:17.432 --> 02:39:22.175]  It's been a marriage that has carried this message for almost, well it's been 10 years now.
[02:39:22.735 --> 02:39:27.057]  So, you know, Midas Resources supports this, and this is a great way to do it.
[02:39:27.377 --> 02:39:28.097]  You can catch it.
[02:39:28.277 --> 02:39:31.258]  Our brokers are waiting for your call.
[02:39:31.278 --> 02:39:31.458]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:39:31.558 --> 02:39:36.140]  And again, the prices are going up.
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:40.281]  These prices are lower because we did accumulate these before the gold prices went up.
[02:39:40.681 --> 02:39:41.802]  Supplies are very limited.
[02:39:42.082 --> 02:39:44.663]  When that stuff's gone, I have to reorder in the marketplace.
[02:39:44.763 --> 02:39:46.003]  I have to pay more for it myself.
[02:39:46.023 --> 02:39:47.004]  So let's give folks the number.
[02:39:47.024 --> 02:39:47.084]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:39:51.145 --> 02:39:58.951]  I know you're getting calls about that silver dollar citizen rule book deal where you get like, what, two citizen's rule books and a silver dollar for like 19 bucks.
[02:39:59.312 --> 02:40:00.453]  Are you still offering that, Ted?
[02:40:00.473 --> 02:40:01.373]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:01.894 --> 02:40:03.815]  Absolutely, that's a great way to get the message out.
[02:40:03.835 --> 02:40:07.058]  That's something we never plug, and it's really, really important.
[02:40:07.498 --> 02:40:08.339]  So, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:40:08.419 --> 02:40:12.422]  And I just want to spend a minute more, Ted, with you.
[02:40:12.442 --> 02:40:17.286]  I know you're busy and I got a bunch of calls, but on the satellite issue, it is not our fault
[02:40:18.041 --> 02:40:20.684]  That the analog satellites are being turned off.
[02:40:21.105 --> 02:40:23.969]  I mean, two years ago they turned off one we had to move.
[02:40:24.449 --> 02:40:27.653]  Then a year ago they turned off a bunch of others we had to move.
[02:40:28.054 --> 02:40:31.478]  And the one we're on right now, sat there turning it off in August.
[02:40:32.654 --> 02:40:34.375]  Now they're saying maybe a few months more.
[02:40:34.395 --> 02:40:38.196]  You know, if you've got an analog satellite out there, Ted will pay to be on it.
[02:40:38.416 --> 02:40:44.218]  But we're on the premium, you know, because what real radio networks are on, folks, people play at it.
[02:40:44.258 --> 02:40:44.958]  This is the real deal.
[02:40:45.578 --> 02:40:51.580]  Stations either have a clear channel receiver, or they have an ABC receiver, or they have one of these Jones receivers.
[02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:56.664]  That's because that's the receiver that radio stations get their feeds off of.
[02:40:56.704 --> 02:40:58.125]  That's what's manufactured.
[02:40:58.365 --> 02:41:02.188]  That's like if I have a light bulb that's made by General Electric, you know?
[02:41:02.508 --> 02:41:03.549]  That's how it works.
[02:41:03.629 --> 02:41:09.353]  And we have the big digital satellites, and we know a lot of people want to listen to the old-fashioned satellite.
[02:41:09.833 --> 02:41:15.036]  We're trying to do that, but we cannot control what the satellite companies do.
[02:41:15.056 --> 02:41:21.219]  And I heard somebody shoot their mouth off the other day, attacking us, trying to claim that we didn't want to, you know, do that.
[02:41:21.499 --> 02:41:22.799]  And that is another lie.
[02:41:22.939 --> 02:41:29.362]  And then the other insane thing is I'm sitting here talking on an electro-voiced microphone, and I don't know who makes it.
[02:41:29.382 --> 02:41:30.323]  I think it's made in Germany.
[02:41:31.201 --> 02:41:33.442]  That doesn't mean I'm controlled by the German government.
[02:41:33.902 --> 02:41:35.223]  This is hilarious.
[02:41:35.343 --> 02:41:40.005]  Some of our Patriot competition is on a Sumner Redstone owned satellite.
[02:41:40.725 --> 02:41:43.006]  Does that mean that they're owned by Sumner Redstone?
[02:41:43.046 --> 02:41:46.127]  No, it's like paying for power from the power company.
[02:41:46.568 --> 02:41:48.148]  It's like a phone line.
[02:41:48.608 --> 02:41:52.730]  If you're on talk radio, you're on an ABC or a Clear Channel.
[02:41:54.151 --> 02:41:56.652]  How many of those digital birds are there, Ted?
[02:41:57.052 --> 02:42:01.034]  Well, there's obviously a lot, and I did, I had somebody call me up.
[02:42:01.074 --> 02:42:02.695]  Well, you're an affiliate of ABC.
[02:42:02.795 --> 02:42:03.656]  Well, you know what?
[02:42:03.936 --> 02:42:16.403]  If you want to syndicate a program, if you want Alex Jones to be on AM and FM stations across the United States and actually win this war, you have to be on a platform that actually feeds into these radio studios for them to play.
[02:42:16.463 --> 02:42:18.164]  But that's not true, though!
[02:42:18.825 --> 02:42:22.487]  To say that we go to them and lease a feed
[02:42:23.207 --> 02:42:36.541]  Like your syndicated gardening show does, or like if you wanted to start a show about drag racing, you go to a radio affiliate, and you are not an affiliate, you go.
[02:42:36.981 --> 02:42:39.744]  But that's what globalists do, Ted.
[02:42:39.784 --> 02:42:41.466]  It's any way to attack.
[02:42:42.146 --> 02:42:44.607]  Folks, do you have Microsoft Windows on your computer?
[02:42:44.627 --> 02:42:46.008]  Well, then you're controlled by Bill Gates!
[02:42:46.248 --> 02:42:47.128]  Yeah, right, exactly.
[02:42:47.148 --> 02:42:51.450]  Well, I mean, that's just... I mean, people jump to these conclusions, but no, absolutely not.
[02:42:51.490 --> 02:42:58.273]  The reason why the satellite systems are changing is because about ten years ago... No, you're behind it, Ted.
[02:42:58.982 --> 02:42:59.382]  What's that?
[02:42:59.563 --> 02:43:01.364]  You're behind it all.
[02:43:01.704 --> 02:43:03.286]  There was a thunderstorm here yesterday.
[02:43:03.326 --> 02:43:03.846]  It's your fault.
[02:43:05.147 --> 02:43:05.948]  Here's what happened.
[02:43:06.789 --> 02:43:12.974]  About 10 years ago there were about 3 million people that had the big 10-foot dishes out there and they're picking up C-band video.
[02:43:13.535 --> 02:43:14.476]  Video that was.
[02:43:14.876 --> 02:43:18.099]  People were watching television off the C-band satellites.
[02:43:18.499 --> 02:43:24.905]  Now there's about 200,000 people that watch video off the C-band satellites and there's not enough
[02:43:25.465 --> 02:43:29.326]  Support from the video watchers to go with this particular platform.
[02:43:29.346 --> 02:43:38.909]  So companies like Stars Encore, which I really got to thank them for putting us up for as long as they have, can no longer compete in that particular platform.
[02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:41.230]  So they're moving on to a more digital platform.
[02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:43.271]  We are the little guy.
[02:43:43.331 --> 02:43:47.832]  We're riding on the backs of these video carriers in order to have that feed forward.
[02:43:47.852 --> 02:43:48.372]  We're evil.
[02:43:48.392 --> 02:43:50.273]  We're in with Starz Encore.
[02:43:50.293 --> 02:43:54.774]  You should string a string to each radio station, Ted.
[02:43:55.274 --> 02:43:57.515]  You should string a string, and I'll talk into a paper cup.
[02:43:58.616 --> 02:44:00.198]  And you know, how dare you breathe air?
[02:44:00.438 --> 02:44:01.659]  Yeah, right.
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:08.267]  Well, if we're guilty of something for doing that with Starz Encore, well then so is every other patriot radio station because of this.
[02:44:08.287 --> 02:44:10.029]  This is mental illness insanity.
[02:44:10.069 --> 02:44:11.631]  This is... or provocateuring.
[02:44:11.771 --> 02:44:12.853]  I just thought it was funny.
[02:44:13.173 --> 02:44:13.874]  That's why I brought it up.
[02:44:13.914 --> 02:44:14.595]  I haven't talked about it.
[02:44:15.275 --> 02:44:18.037]  Ted, I want to thank you for coming on and all your support of Freedom.
[02:44:18.357 --> 02:44:20.098]  Folks, give Minus Resources a call.
[02:44:20.118 --> 02:44:20.839]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:44:20.859 --> 02:44:21.199]  800-686-2237.
[02:44:21.819 --> 02:44:27.803]  Give them a call.
[02:44:28.123 --> 02:44:30.224]  They've got something that's comfortable for everybody.
[02:44:30.824 --> 02:44:32.806]  And it's a good position to have some gold.
[02:44:32.846 --> 02:44:33.986]  I mean, it's not hard to sell that.
[02:44:34.287 --> 02:44:35.187]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[02:44:35.307 --> 02:44:36.128]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:44:36.248 --> 02:44:37.188]  Keep up the good job.
[02:44:37.889 --> 02:44:38.449]  Absolutely.
[02:44:38.569 --> 02:44:41.471]  People are really going to go nuts when we're on Dish Network.
[02:44:44.645 --> 02:44:47.486]  Oh man, reaching a potential of 22 million people!
[02:44:48.606 --> 02:44:52.488]  You're really going to rip your hair out when we get on XM!
[02:44:54.168 --> 02:44:55.409]  By the way, you know why?
[02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:56.769]  Because you can't stop the truth.
[02:44:57.270 --> 02:45:02.932]  People want the truth and the people are lobbying for it and they'll know they'll get subscribers by putting us on.
[02:45:02.972 --> 02:45:03.872]  That's good!
[02:45:04.612 --> 02:45:06.033]  That's good!
[02:45:06.653 --> 02:45:07.053]  Jeff!
[02:45:07.882 --> 02:45:09.846]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:45:09.866 --> 02:45:12.111]  Where are you calling us from, Jeff?
[02:45:12.271 --> 02:45:12.892]  Illinois.
[02:45:13.093 --> 02:45:13.594]  Welcome, sir.
[02:45:13.634 --> 02:45:14.155]  I've got to move quick.
[02:45:14.195 --> 02:45:15.197]  Go ahead.
[02:45:15.317 --> 02:45:18.083]  Earlier this week, Radio Netherlands revealed that
[02:45:18.678 --> 02:45:22.842]  An ex-fine minister there said that in fact... But they're on a satellite!
[02:45:22.883 --> 02:45:23.503]  That's bad!
[02:45:23.523 --> 02:45:28.428]  I mean, right now, I'm talking, you know, when you call in on a phone, it goes over to satellite.
[02:45:28.468 --> 02:45:29.449]  That's bad, buddy!
[02:45:29.469 --> 02:45:32.433]  In fact, who's your long-distance carrier?
[02:45:34.174 --> 02:45:36.557]  I go with independent phone cards.
[02:45:37.258 --> 02:45:38.379]  Well, those are evil, too.
[02:45:38.419 --> 02:45:39.280]  They're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:40.861]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:45:42.009 --> 02:45:42.550]  I'll shut up.
[02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:45.732]  Yes, it was reported and you're right, we covered it on Monday.
[02:45:45.752 --> 02:45:48.154]  I must have missed it on that A.Q.
[02:45:48.194 --> 02:45:51.856]  Kahn in the CIA saying don't prosecute A.Q.
[02:45:51.916 --> 02:45:54.698]  Kahn and if they prosecuted him in 78,
[02:45:56.235 --> 02:46:03.680]  Yeah, he's the guy handing out nuclear weapons components like lollipops at a barber shop, and our government was protecting him.
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.302]  Bush signed W199I to protect Khan.
[02:46:07.803 --> 02:46:09.023]  That was in 2001.
[02:46:09.504 --> 02:46:10.564]  Clinton did it in 96.
[02:46:11.445 --> 02:46:12.445]  He's their agent.
[02:46:12.486 --> 02:46:12.826]  Go ahead.
[02:46:13.466 --> 02:46:18.229]  Well, I think you have covered this before.
[02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:23.873]  I've done it with the public, that we should be, when they talk about terrorism in the 20th century,
[02:46:26.078 --> 02:46:30.543]  Billions of people were killed by terrorism, but it was by their own government.
[02:46:31.041 --> 02:46:39.007]  The number of people that are killed by these agent provocateurs and cat spas that they call terrorists are minuscule.
[02:46:39.067 --> 02:46:44.630]  They're actually less than the number of people that are killed by hospitals, doctors, and pharmacists in this country.
[02:46:44.650 --> 02:46:45.731]  You know, I forget the number.
[02:46:45.751 --> 02:46:48.393]  It's 200-something thousand a year die of malpractice?
[02:46:48.773 --> 02:46:50.414]  Well, depending on the study, 75,000 to 200,000 in the U.S.
[02:46:50.454 --> 02:46:53.436]  There are about 3,000 to 6,000 people killed crossing the street yearly.
[02:46:57.501 --> 02:46:59.382]  Half of them by hit-and-run drivers.
[02:46:59.742 --> 02:47:01.102]  Oh, that's El Caido.
[02:47:01.142 --> 02:47:01.822]  Yeah.
[02:47:01.842 --> 02:47:08.704]  So they go, boo, boo, be very afraid, be very afraid, give away all your... Well, we've got cops killing two people a day now, this year.
[02:47:08.724 --> 02:47:09.564]  That's the new trend.
[02:47:09.584 --> 02:47:13.545]  And as they get more tasers out, they taser more old people, and you're going to have more of this.
[02:47:13.805 --> 02:47:19.247]  Well, anyway, I miss your coverage of the AQ Con.
[02:47:19.387 --> 02:47:20.627]  No, I didn't talk about it enough.
[02:47:20.667 --> 02:47:21.047]  Thank you.
[02:47:21.207 --> 02:47:22.567]  Good to hear from you, Jeff.
[02:47:22.587 --> 02:47:23.128]  Great point.
[02:47:23.168 --> 02:47:24.008]  No, it's insane.
[02:47:24.788 --> 02:47:27.369]  Well, the MI6, mass bombers, MI6.
[02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:30.890]  Brian, where are you calling from?
[02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:32.190]  I'm calling from Virginia.
[02:47:32.770 --> 02:47:33.310]  Ah, welcome.
[02:47:33.770 --> 02:47:34.150]  Thank you.
[02:47:34.531 --> 02:47:51.835]  Every once in a while they have a Meet the Governor here on the radio stations in Virginia, and a friend of mine called in and asked Mark Warner, does he know, being that you had all these surpluses in the Virginia budget, and took the successes, are you going to take this to the national level, and is that why you were invited to Bilderberg?
[02:47:53.064 --> 02:47:58.371]  Immediately goes on the defensive of Bilderberg, says, well it's just a trade organization, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:58.391 --> 02:48:06.841]  You just calmly bring it up, and then... I got one that can see, so what else does he say?
[02:48:07.342 --> 02:48:10.025]  Well, he says he's invited by the RNC chairman, and...
[02:48:11.215 --> 02:48:14.097]  He, uh, volunteered information about what he was doing with the money.
[02:48:14.177 --> 02:48:24.985]  First, he says, well, you know, we're pinning towards this bay, $150 million, and he says, well, most of it we're pinning aside to make way for the economic downturn, or excuse me, the housing downturn that's expected.
[02:48:26.486 --> 02:48:30.769]  Well, they are expecting a construction bubble pop.
[02:48:31.689 --> 02:48:35.972]  Absolutely, and it should be bad enough to where the government is setting aside money for this.
[02:48:36.973 --> 02:48:37.854]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:48:38.254 --> 02:48:39.715]  No, sir, I just wanted to bring that up.
[02:48:40.313 --> 02:48:41.473]  Well, excellent point, sir.
[02:48:41.514 --> 02:48:42.354]  Thank you for calling.
[02:48:42.374 --> 02:48:45.435]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.136 --> 02:48:50.017]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.257 --> 02:48:50.957]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:51.037 --> 02:48:51.837]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.178 --> 02:48:56.879]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:01.621]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:02.041 --> 02:49:06.183]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.423 --> 02:49:09.284]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.364 --> 02:49:14.026]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.226 --> 02:49:18.647]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.887 --> 02:49:26.089]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.350 --> 02:49:28.770]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:03.364]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[02:50:03.404 --> 02:50:07.368]  It removes parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.648 --> 02:50:11.572]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.812 --> 02:50:18.338]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:18.558 --> 02:50:24.043]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:24.284 --> 02:50:28.868]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[02:50:29.108 --> 02:50:31.211]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:47.287 --> 02:50:47.747]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.652 --> 02:51:03.253]  I think so.
[02:51:22.827 --> 02:51:23.087]  I think so.
[02:51:57.247 --> 02:51:58.988]  Hi Alex.
[02:51:59.228 --> 02:52:03.651]  Alex, I'm calling up because I want to get your reality check on something that I've noticed.
[02:52:03.811 --> 02:52:08.275]  I live in a community that is very largely multicultural in New York.
[02:52:08.355 --> 02:52:17.081]  We have immigrants from all the different continents in the world and I like to talk to people and sort of gauge them and get an idea where they're coming from.
[02:52:18.044 --> 02:52:25.589]  Um, I have noticed something and I found the result, it's just anecdotal, and my result is completely the opposite of what I thought I would find.
[02:52:25.849 --> 02:52:26.749]  Okay, what have you found?
[02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:44.900]  That of the people from various continents, the ones that seem to be the least hip, most broken of spirit, or most obtuse to this New World Order conspiracy, if you'd like to call it that, are not the people from Asia or Latin America, but the immigrants from Europe.
[02:52:46.403 --> 02:52:50.624]  Well, that's because we've had it good so long, we've gotten dumbed down and turned into lazy idiots.
[02:52:50.924 --> 02:52:54.145]  Look, I've found Latin Americans know about the New World Order instantly.
[02:52:54.445 --> 02:52:57.905]  They may not have the big picture and may be conned by a few things, but nobody's perfect.
[02:52:58.205 --> 02:53:01.106]  But Latin Americans are really about the most awake you'll find.
[02:53:01.566 --> 02:53:02.586]  Arabs are the next.
[02:53:03.066 --> 02:53:03.866]  Then Asians.
[02:53:05.267 --> 02:53:06.027]  Not Chinese.
[02:53:06.067 --> 02:53:11.928]  I'm not saying all Chinese, but a lot of Chinese are government-worshiping, kind of like, you know, maybe Brits or something.
[02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:15.707]  But, you know, a lot of it's the engineering.
[02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:20.620]  The Japanese will follow orders, but they don't trust their government or our government.
[02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:21.702]  They're very open.
[02:53:22.518 --> 02:53:25.721]  And yet I found the same results from talking to people in my community.
[02:53:25.741 --> 02:53:26.502]  And that shocked me.
[02:53:26.542 --> 02:53:33.548]  I thought people who immigrated from Europe would... Well, you talk to somebody from Japan, or somebody from Mexico, or somebody from America, and go, the government did 9-11.
[02:53:33.568 --> 02:53:34.749]  They go, of course they did!
[02:53:34.809 --> 02:53:35.810]  They always do!
[02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:42.015]  And you talk to some little goody two-shoe from Germany, or, you know, France, and how dare you!
[02:53:42.496 --> 02:53:44.598]  Even though a lot of folks over there are wire-awake too.
[02:53:45.259 --> 02:53:51.621]  But by and large, I do find that they seem to be the most obtuse or the most pliant to this near-slave state.
[02:53:52.141 --> 02:53:52.842]  Which amazes me.
[02:53:52.902 --> 02:53:54.602]  I thought it would be an opposite result.
[02:53:54.722 --> 02:53:55.963]  Well, I mean, look.
[02:53:56.583 --> 02:53:56.843]  Look.
[02:53:58.044 --> 02:54:06.166]  With plenty, with prosperity, comes laziness, sloth, decadence, and enslavement.
[02:54:06.226 --> 02:54:07.687]  And then the cycle starts over again.
[02:54:08.579 --> 02:54:10.820]  And it's happened, Ron.
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:11.240]  What do you think?
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:16.962]  Did you hear that newscast I played where the police and military are trying to deal with American rebels now?
[02:54:16.982 --> 02:54:18.442]  They're actually calling us rebels?
[02:54:18.922 --> 02:54:20.663]  Well, that's... I'll tell you what, Alex.
[02:54:20.823 --> 02:54:21.623]  That's nothing new.
[02:54:21.663 --> 02:54:28.565]  Your listeners should know that that's gone on at least, at least and maybe longer, somewhere around 13 to 15 years.
[02:54:29.626 --> 02:54:30.886]  Oh, did you see that on the force?
[02:54:31.627 --> 02:54:32.227]  I beg your pardon?
[02:54:32.347 --> 02:54:34.088]  Did you see that on the New York Police Department?
[02:54:34.668 --> 02:54:36.709]  Oh yeah, it started about the Clinton era.
[02:54:36.929 --> 02:54:38.330]  This all came in the Clinton era.
[02:54:38.510 --> 02:54:40.631]  Well actually it came in under Bush Senior.
[02:54:40.651 --> 02:54:46.374]  No, a little bit, a little bit under Pompa, but it came in in a significant noticeable way starting in the Clinton era.
[02:54:46.434 --> 02:54:48.935]  So, so New York Police train and call us rebels?
[02:54:49.565 --> 02:54:56.868]  Well, they have like a culture in which like, you know, constitutionalists are in suspicion.
[02:54:56.888 --> 02:54:59.969]  No, I knew about that, Ron, and thanks for the call.
[02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:01.690]  I've got to make a final call here.
[02:55:01.930 --> 02:55:03.731]  No, no, on this video they're calling us rebels.
[02:55:04.331 --> 02:55:06.492]  It's not even terrorists anymore, it's the rebels.
[02:55:07.395 --> 02:55:08.356]  There's gonna be rebels!
[02:55:08.416 --> 02:55:09.936]  We gotta get their guns!
[02:55:10.497 --> 02:55:11.557]  Will in Wisconsin!
[02:55:11.697 --> 02:55:12.457]  Go ahead, rebel!
[02:55:13.458 --> 02:55:14.058]  Ah, yes!
[02:55:14.138 --> 02:55:15.519]  You rebel scum!
[02:55:15.779 --> 02:55:17.880]  Control the people!
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:20.101]  Control the people!
[02:55:20.581 --> 02:55:24.583]  I predict the gas price will go up to over $10 a gallon!
[02:55:24.944 --> 02:55:29.806]  So that we, the politicians, yes, push!
[02:55:30.245 --> 02:55:33.767]  We'll control people free of movement.
[02:55:34.027 --> 02:55:41.070]  By the way, we must outlaw swimming pools because there are 100 times more young that die in swimming pools than by the gun.
[02:55:41.471 --> 02:55:43.832]  I thought it was 14 times, but okay.
[02:55:43.852 --> 02:55:45.052]  100 times more in swimming pools.
[02:55:45.292 --> 02:55:46.273]  Outlaw swimming pools!
[02:55:46.913 --> 02:55:47.393]  I agree.
[02:55:47.473 --> 02:55:48.374]  Outlaw knives.
[02:55:48.414 --> 02:55:49.454]  They kill more than guns.
[02:55:49.855 --> 02:55:50.335]  Yeah!
[02:55:51.095 --> 02:55:52.176]  Hey, you got a good show.
[02:55:52.196 --> 02:55:52.896]  You're a good man.
[02:55:52.916 --> 02:55:53.837]  You keep tugging along.
[02:55:54.037 --> 02:55:54.957]  You're a good man, Will.
[02:55:54.997 --> 02:55:55.577]  Anything else?
[02:55:57.447 --> 02:55:59.528]  I don't know, I'll tell ya, I'm really worried though.
[02:55:59.568 --> 02:56:03.629]  I think, uh, we're... Hey, by the way, Southwest, uh, America, is that true?
[02:56:03.749 --> 02:56:08.850]  Now, Southwest USA, was it true yesterday that they didn't even get, uh, aviation fuel for planes?
[02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:10.210]  Many planes were shut down there?
[02:56:10.531 --> 02:56:10.831]  Yes.
[02:56:11.831 --> 02:56:12.831]  Something's going on.
[02:56:13.791 --> 02:56:14.011]  Yep.
[02:56:14.692 --> 02:56:17.012]  Yes, aviation fuel, everything's gonna be controlled.
[02:56:17.712 --> 02:56:19.973]  Well, the training is how to be slaves, which is freedom.
[02:56:20.353 --> 02:56:22.254]  Alright, folks, see you back tomorrow, back tonight.
[02:56:22.454 --> 02:56:23.594]  God bless you all, take care.
[02:56:25.862 --> 02:56:30.467]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[02:56:30.487 --> 02:56:30.647]  Hello!
