[00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.249]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:09.812]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:11.293]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:17.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:21.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:56.470]  Well, it's got to be six, eight months ago we interviewed the chief economist for the Department of Labor for the current president, Morgan Reynolds, who, like so many other academics and...
[00:00:57.538 --> 00:00:58.499]  We're good to go.
[00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:19.409]  Of the government here that carried out this attack.
[00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.350]  So, he'll be joining us in the third hour today.
[00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.633]  We're going to have wide open phones on any news item, any issue, any story you wish to discuss.
[00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:32.294]  1-800-259-9231 I want to get into the dollar tumbling against major currencies ahead of Fed announcement.
[00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:49.073]  Also, I want to get back into this story that we broke last Friday.
[00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:52.554]  Republican Congressman says totalitarian regime a danger.
[00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:59.295]  Bob Barr says military dictatorship very, very close, and that Bush is more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.316]  He's on the board of directors of the NRA, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:10.698]  Also, just out, a Saudi prince overheard and overheard, ordered Fox News to change story.
[00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:11.979]  We're good to go.
[00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:49.778]  A couple arrested for sex rage, and it sounds like tabloid-type trash, and it is, but I'm going to cover it because it's got a little wrinkle to it that I think overall gives us a clear picture of what's happening to our society.
[00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.322]  We will also get into the Australian unrest that has now spread into other cities.
[00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:03.346]  The unrest has spread from Sydney to other cities as people of Arab descent are attacked by whites.
[00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:05.287]  Now, that is happening.
[00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:07.662]  And I think that it's wrong.
[00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:25.372]  The problem is that when people of Arab and black African descent attacked whites in France, which it clearly started that way for the first few weeks and was still predominantly racially motivated, the media covered it up here in the United States because it was politically incorrect.
[00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:30.715]  But when whites go out and attack Arabs...
[00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:38.515]  Then it is evil and racist and probably controlled by some Nazi organization, and that's what they say.
[00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:41.077]  We think Nazis may be in control of this.
[00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:57.848]  No, if you go read previous reports in the last few weeks, and it's nowhere in our press, but it's in the Australian press, groups of Arabs were going around and beating up girls who weren't wearing their headdresses, that is, Australian girls,
[00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.410]  We're good to go.
[00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:23.698]  And, you know, I'm not here frothing, saying the Arabs are all devils and want to kill us and we've got to invade Iran.
[00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:26.820]  I don't buy into the whole neocon thing that they're about to jihad us.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.941]  But this is what always happens.
[00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:34.043]  I mean, you bring white Irish or white German folks over here, they're going to kick the Native Americans out.
[00:04:34.723 --> 00:04:38.425]  You bring a bunch of Arabs into white Australia, they're going to kick the whites out.
[00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.546]  I mean, this is just what happens.
[00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:44.548]  And, quite frankly, we don't live together at all in peace and loving each other.
[00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:46.108]  And the globalists know that, too.
[00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:47.209]  It's part of their larger plan.
[00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:50.546]  So we'll get into all this and a lot more.
[00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:54.349]  There's so much news on what's happening with Bush's G.D.
[00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:55.609]  Constitution comment.
[00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.091]  And just a lot more coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:00.453]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:05.576]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:10.180]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.703]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:16.124]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.865 --> 00:05:22.088]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:29.072]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:31.274]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:42.001]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:43.882]  If you want to understand what the new world order represents,
[00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:44.662]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:45.983]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:04.236]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:08.459]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.502]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:14.103]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.284 --> 00:06:22.950]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.491]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:28.814]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:29.775]  We're good to go.
[00:06:48.117 --> 00:06:49.398]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:50.619]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.266]  I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:19.369]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.814]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[00:07:25.427 --> 00:07:30.129]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:49.298]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:54.641]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll-free
[00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:06.126]  888-421-6181 The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:08.730]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:32.179]  Look, the social architects, the engineers that control our society, want to break up our families, they want to disarm us, physically as well as mentally and psychologically.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.680]  That is dumbing us down and getting our firearms.
[00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:43.443]  They confuse us with these diversionary theatrical displays of having Bill Clinton fight with George Bush Sr.
[00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:52.849]  when they're really both CIA officers, just like Tony Blair admittedly was MI6 way back 30 years ago when he was a zit-faced kid at university.
[00:08:53.963 --> 00:08:56.284]  We're running different peace activist operations.
[00:08:56.804 --> 00:09:05.546]  Just like Vladimir Putin's former KGB section chief of what was Leningrad and then Stalingrad and now today St.
[00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:06.166]  Petersburg.
[00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:08.766]  It's the same system.
[00:09:08.846 --> 00:09:12.127]  And they're controlled by these large corporate interests.
[00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:14.608]  And there's no debating it.
[00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:16.448]  That's the facts.
[00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:20.949]  That's the facts of the world that we live in today.
[00:09:22.347 --> 00:09:24.409]  But they have to give us the illusion of choice.
[00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:27.411]  They need to get us broken up into different camps.
[00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:41.362]  Not as Americans who are together for the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, for freedom, but to get us vulcanized into different camps that are busy fighting with each other over Republican versus Democrat.
[00:09:42.943 --> 00:09:44.364]  And they own both parties.
[00:09:44.404 --> 00:09:50.309]  And I know that most Americans instinctively know this is true, but they still say, well, I've got to vote for the lesser of two evils.
[00:09:51.002 --> 00:09:52.983]  And that may be the case at the local level.
[00:09:53.023 --> 00:09:54.904]  There's city council people you can vote for.
[00:09:55.224 --> 00:09:56.284]  There's county commissioners.
[00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:57.144]  There's state reps.
[00:09:57.425 --> 00:10:00.426]  There's even some good congressmen and women that are up there in Washington.
[00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:06.368]  But you're not going to get into a committee chairmanship, a high-level one, a very important one, unless you're a globalist.
[00:10:06.388 --> 00:10:10.970]  Unless they've got a bunch of skeletons and their serial numbers in their files.
[00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.771]  Unless they know you've got skeletons in your closet.
[00:10:16.172 --> 00:10:19.373]  Unless they know you've taken money dozens and dozens of times.
[00:10:21.013 --> 00:10:28.054]  But they'll have these little fights, and as Ron Paul has said just a few weeks ago on this show, there is a fight over who gets the levers of power.
[00:10:28.274 --> 00:10:45.798]  There is a fight over who gets to be the CEO job, who gets to have that CEO management job inside the New World Order over this regional holding in the global empire that is the United States of America, the main military engine of these private global corporate interests.
[00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:52.080]  But they get us so committed, so in love with our parties.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.701]  It doesn't matter how corrupt Bill Clinton was.
[00:10:54.761 --> 00:10:56.181]  Democrats wouldn't wake up to it.
[00:10:57.702 --> 00:11:00.403]  It didn't matter how corrupt George Bush Jr.
[00:11:00.443 --> 00:11:02.103]  was or how corrupt Nixon was.
[00:11:02.183 --> 00:11:03.384]  Republicans would still defend him.
[00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:07.646]  It doesn't matter how bad George Bush is.
[00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:09.567]  People have thrown in with him.
[00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:11.308]  They can't admit they're wrong.
[00:11:11.768 --> 00:11:13.809]  They can't admit that they've done the wrong thing.
[00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:14.630]  They can't admit.
[00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.313]  It's just like a drunk who's drinking ten shots of Jack Daniels every night.
[00:11:19.753 --> 00:11:20.413]  It's killing them.
[00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:21.694]  Their body's falling apart.
[00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:26.797]  But you try to tell them that it's bad for them, they're going to tell you to shut up.
[00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:28.935]  And it's the same thing.
[00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:41.201]  But look, in the final equation, Bush really is a puppet who sleeps two hours a day and works out two and a half, three hours a day and prances around and gives a speech once a week and goes fishing and playing golf.
[00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:42.001]  He's a dilettante.
[00:11:42.962 --> 00:11:44.743]  Bill Clinton was actually evil.
[00:11:44.783 --> 00:11:47.944]  Bill Clinton was actually trying to impress the globalists.
[00:11:47.984 --> 00:11:50.305]  He was trying to implement everything they wanted.
[00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:53.167]  He was trying to do it with finesse and aplomb.
[00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:55.668]  A very sneaky Machiavellian creature.
[00:11:55.708 --> 00:11:56.148]  Very evil.
[00:11:57.265 --> 00:12:03.048]  With Bush, it's just, do it my way, shut up, or the terrorists will get you.
[00:12:03.188 --> 00:12:06.370]  He's saying, reauthorize the Patriot Act, or terrorists will strike.
[00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:13.453]  It's like Dick Cheney saying, if you continue to investigate 9-11, I'll never forget this, I'll meet the press, Al-Qaeda will hit, it will be nuclear.
[00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:21.257]  So it really is in your face, it really is happening at this level.
[00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:37.564]  So, we need to realize that we're losing our liberties, we're losing our freedoms, and we shouldn't look at what the politicians say.
[00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:38.644]  It's really simple.
[00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.325]  We need to look at what they actually do.
[00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:46.467]  And Doug Thompson over at CapitolHillBlue.com, I mean, I remember...
[00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:49.175]  We're good to go.
[00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:49.515]  I think?
[00:13:14.014 --> 00:13:15.655]  And so he gets more and more sources.
[00:13:16.456 --> 00:13:24.783]  And there have been about four big things that come to memory that he's broken about Bush in the last few years.
[00:13:24.843 --> 00:13:26.924]  And they've all turned out to be true.
[00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:28.986]  Who's going to be indicted?
[00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:33.750]  When everybody else was saying it was going to be Cheney and other people, he said Scooter Libby.
[00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:37.933]  Because the White House was aware of that months before it happened.
[00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:40.195]  So he was able to get that through his sources.
[00:13:41.148 --> 00:13:47.514]  Bush on Prozac, running around throwing fits, screaming at staffers for 30 minutes at a tirade.
[00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:51.798]  Just innocent staffers, low-level nobodies that literally bring him Diet Cokes.
[00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:59.765]  And then later it comes out in New York Daily News and other places with senior staffers saying, yeah, they're worried about Bush's sanity.
[00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:02.487]  So there have been so many things.
[00:14:02.688 --> 00:14:05.070]  And Thompson, we're trying to get on the show.
[00:14:06.972 --> 00:14:34.444]  Thompson, the latest thing is that Bush is in this cabinet meeting at the end of last month, just a week ago, well actually now about two weeks ago, and he's in there with these congressional delegation and around the big wood table there in the West Wing where you see a lot of their public press conferences and discussions they have, cabinet level meetings, and it's this big room full of people
[00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.253]  And they come in and they say, listen, we're getting in a lot of trouble trying to pass this.
[00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:42.055]  The people are angry that they don't want to go along with it.
[00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:44.117]  This is really hurting the Republican Party.
[00:14:44.437 --> 00:14:47.060]  And he says, I don't give a GED, Bush retorted.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.762]  I, the President, the Commander-in-Chief, do it.
[00:14:50.282 --> 00:14:51.043]  Do what I say.
[00:14:51.964 --> 00:14:54.986]  Stop throwing the Constitution in my face, Bush screamed back.
[00:14:55.066 --> 00:14:56.848]  It's just a GED piece of paper.
[00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.930]  Well, now the neocons are going into high gear, demanding that Mr. Thompson give up his sources.
[00:15:03.551 --> 00:15:06.214]  Acting like, oh, this is ridiculous, he won't give us his sources.
[00:15:07.336 --> 00:15:12.803]  As if this is something new in journalism.
[00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:15.487]  This is nothing new.
[00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.329]  This is one of the backbones of journalism.
[00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:26.276]  And then you've just got to, over time, look at the track record of a outfit and see what their agenda is and see if you trust them.
[00:15:26.316 --> 00:15:29.818]  But in time, stuff always gets proven or disproven.
[00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:37.225]  And you have to be looking at the news in a long-term, long lens and remember who you can trust.
[00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:39.947]  But listen, you also have to look at the other evidence.
[00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:44.010]  It's been in mainstream press that Bush cusses all the time.
[00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.532]  It's been in the press that he flips people off.
[00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.113]  We have video of him when he was governor.
[00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:51.955]  Running for governor, to be precise.
[00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:56.559]  Flipping off his staff and yelling at his staff and flipping the camera off.
[00:15:57.059 --> 00:15:59.261]  It's going up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:00.582]  I mean, it's in the archives.
[00:16:00.602 --> 00:16:02.143]  We're posting it back on the main page.
[00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:08.248]  There have been several instances of him and his father flipping people off and cussing at people.
[00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:11.349]  And then there's a whole other level of spin after that.
[00:16:12.229 --> 00:16:20.172]  First level is, oh, he's a good Christian who we can trust, and so how dare you talk bad about him.
[00:16:20.592 --> 00:16:21.393]  He didn't do this.
[00:16:21.453 --> 00:16:22.613]  It's liberal propaganda.
[00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:26.675]  Well, my argument to that is, while I find it to be...
[00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:33.820]  Blasphemous, and I'm going to be honest with you, I've hit my finger with a hammer before, hammering something, and I think a GD's come out.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.981]  I mean, most of us do that.
[00:16:37.382 --> 00:16:41.746]  The point is, it isn't that he's saying GD, it isn't that he's screaming and cussing at people.
[00:16:41.786 --> 00:16:44.368]  That's screaming and cussing at people and frothing is bad.
[00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.231]  What is dangerous is that he's saying it about the Constitution.
[00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:56.633]  I was listening to Derry Brownfield this morning, and a caller was calling in, kind of halfway defending Bush, and he said, well, we all say G.D.
[00:16:56.673 --> 00:16:57.793]  What's the big deal?
[00:16:57.813 --> 00:17:00.794]  I mean, you know, people are making big deals.
[00:17:00.834 --> 00:17:01.734]  This is political.
[00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:04.635]  It isn't about the G.D.
[00:17:05.676 --> 00:17:11.017]  I mean, that's part of it, but the lion's share of it is that he's saying G.D.
[00:17:11.177 --> 00:17:12.497]  about the Constitution.
[00:17:12.737 --> 00:17:14.518]  He's saying it's just a piece of paper.
[00:17:15.206 --> 00:17:21.508]  In fact, him saying just a piece of paper, politically and for our fortunes and for our freedoms, is worse than the GED.
[00:17:21.768 --> 00:17:23.869]  He's specifically saying, I don't like this.
[00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:25.249]  I want to get rid of it.
[00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.390]  And then, do we believe the Thompson Report?
[00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.450]  Well, we know he's got a good track record.
[00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.851]  We know Bush is constantly cussing and screaming and saying GED.
[00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:35.232]  And saying stuff a lot worse.
[00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:39.393]  Let's just say a lot more classically profane, non-Kings English.
[00:17:41.053 --> 00:17:46.595]  But we also know that Alberto Gonzalez, our Attorney General, said that it's a piece of paper.
[00:17:47.136 --> 00:17:48.136]  That it's outmoded.
[00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:49.417]  That it's quaint.
[00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:51.337]  He said that about the Constitution.
[00:17:51.357 --> 00:17:52.318]  He said that about the Medal of Rights.
[00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:53.758]  He said that about the Geneva Convention.
[00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:55.519]  So we have that.
[00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:57.720]  We have Karl Rhodes on the New York Times.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.821]  They control reality.
[00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:00.802]  They're basically getting rid of the Constitution.
[00:18:01.282 --> 00:18:06.844]  So we have all these other public statements, public memos, where we can read where they're saying this in meetings.
[00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:08.805]  So, of course, this is true.
[00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:10.735]  This is absolute gold.
[00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:11.836]  I know this is true.
[00:18:12.437 --> 00:18:16.580]  Because, as I just pointed out, I pointed out about 20 different indicators.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.763]  There's over 100 that I can look at in that constellation.
[00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:25.388]  When I do that calculation, when I look at a piece, 99% chance this is true.
[00:18:25.728 --> 00:18:29.131]  But regardless, the debate about it we know is reality-based.
[00:18:29.612 --> 00:18:34.496]  People are upset about him not caring about the Constitution and saying it's outmoded in a piece of paper.
[00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:42.345]  They're upset about him saying GD, or they're denying it and saying he didn't say GD.
[00:18:44.766 --> 00:18:46.187]  And that really is infantile.
[00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:55.971]  I mean, you should be upset by the arrogance, the callousness, the hubris, the disgust, the dripping venom he has over our founding documents.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.700]  That's the problem.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.141]  I'm done talking about it.
[00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.161]  I've got a bunch of other news.
[00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:02.141]  Good news.
[00:19:02.181 --> 00:19:06.662]  Diebold CEO resigns after reports of fraud, litigation, and internal woes.
[00:19:08.363 --> 00:19:11.743]  One of the biggest electronic fraud CIA fronts in deep trouble.
[00:19:12.143 --> 00:19:15.184]  Bush denies he lives in a bubble, but he's the one that told us he did.
[00:19:16.004 --> 00:19:18.985]  ACLU pushes for release of prison torture documents.
[00:19:20.245 --> 00:19:22.806]  Al-Qaeda plane attack a...
[00:19:24.582 --> 00:19:28.183]  Case of oil depot fire sounds like disinfo.
[00:19:28.723 --> 00:19:30.704]  And I agree with Paul Watson's comment on that.
[00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:36.166]  Also, an empire without value, the defenders of torture by Paul Greg Roberts.
[00:19:36.246 --> 00:19:37.526]  I want to get into that.
[00:19:37.546 --> 00:19:49.370]  I've got a big stack of news here where people are being arrested for 11 days for jaywalking, for selling someone a subway token for...
[00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:51.088]  Anything.
[00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.391]  Just anything and everything.
[00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:53.374]  Throwing the book at us.
[00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:55.519]  You're going to see more and more of that.
[00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:57.705]  Letting us know we're slaves.
[00:19:58.146 --> 00:19:58.587]  Stay with us.
[00:19:58.607 --> 00:19:59.429]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:04.104]  E equals MC squared is wrong.
[00:20:04.564 --> 00:20:05.405]  What are you talking about?
[00:20:05.665 --> 00:20:07.146]  Einstein's equations have errors.
[00:20:07.286 --> 00:20:09.968]  It's in this book I've been reading, The Collapse of Special Relativity.
[00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:11.209]  That can't be right.
[00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:12.230]  Where did you hear about that?
[00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.872]  In Requiem for Relativity, The Collapse of Special Relativity.
[00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:19.535]  A book at relativitycollapse.net and relativitycollapse.com.
[00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:22.176]  I liked what they had to say, so I bought it at amazon.com.
[00:20:22.717 --> 00:20:23.537]  I don't know.
[00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.339]  It sounds like it'd be complicated to read.
[00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:26.479]  That's where you're wrong.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.320]  It's written with a
[00:20:29.872 --> 00:20:33.019]  Are you sure?
[00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:35.143]  I mean, E equals MC squared.
[00:20:35.624 --> 00:20:36.466]  That's got to be wrong.
[00:20:36.747 --> 00:20:37.087]  It is.
[00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:38.491]  That's not what I meant.
[00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:39.593]  Where'd you find that book?
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:48.184]  Requiem for Relativity, The Collapse of Special Relativity at relativitycollapse.com, relativitycollapse.net, or amazon.com.
[00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:50.085]  I still can't believe that Einstein is wrong.
[00:20:50.385 --> 00:20:51.625]  It's the 21st century.
[00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:52.386]  Get up to speed.
[00:20:52.806 --> 00:20:59.749]  Just buy The Collapse of Special Relativity at relativitycollapse.com or relativitycollapse.net or amazon.com today.

[00:23:05.424 --> 00:23:10.627]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:23:11.487 --> 00:23:18.371]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:27.977]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:29.085]  516-8736.
[00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:29.365]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:21.762]  We've got Morgan Reynolds, who was the chief economist in the Bush administration for the Department of Labor.
[00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:30.985]  Joining us coming up in the third hour, we'll talk about government involvement in 9-11, the war, the police state, all of it.
[00:24:31.005 --> 00:24:42.513]  A very conservative member of our community, just like Paul Craig Roberts, saying the government is run by psychopathic Nazis and may carry out terror attacks as a pretext for control and may set up martial law.
[00:24:42.993 --> 00:24:45.015]  Ron Paul saying we may set up martial law.
[00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:48.363]  Of course, Bob Barr saying it last Friday.
[00:24:48.983 --> 00:24:50.284]  How many others have to say it?
[00:24:50.564 --> 00:24:51.664]  This is the reality.
[00:24:51.684 --> 00:24:53.565]  Again, I go back to that word, reality.
[00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:57.726]  Coming up, I want to get into General Motors.
[00:24:57.926 --> 00:25:00.947]  Reuters is reporting, could go bankrupt.
[00:25:01.288 --> 00:25:02.428]  Formerly our biggest...
[00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:12.854]  Biggest corporation, biggest part of our economy, dwarfing everything else, now very small and basically compared to other companies, and falling apart.
[00:25:13.274 --> 00:25:21.661]  But you've got your wonderful Walmart pieces of junk that break one week after you buy them, made by poor Chinese slaves, so everything's okay.
[00:25:23.423 --> 00:25:29.027]  But this is the type of news I have in front of me every single day, and most days I become desensitized so I don't cover it.
[00:25:30.369 --> 00:25:31.750]  Homeowner promotes...
[00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:36.723]  See, suddenly I can't read headlines today.
[00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:37.544]  I'm a little bit dingy.
[00:25:37.944 --> 00:25:44.669]  Homeowner protest DEA action in home, and it's just part of the course.
[00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:49.812]  They came in without warrants and aimed guns at him and marched through his house and didn't find any drugs and just left.
[00:25:51.273 --> 00:25:52.133]  Happens all the time.
[00:25:52.153 --> 00:25:54.675]  No warrant, but they just think that that's the way it is.
[00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:57.622]  And here is another article.
[00:25:57.682 --> 00:25:59.863]  This is out of the Dallas Observer.
[00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:06.526]  Bus Gestapo dark cops put a guy in jail for 11 days for jaywalking.
[00:26:07.947 --> 00:26:12.629]  And it gets into all the things that they did to him for jaywalking.
[00:26:13.289 --> 00:26:14.050]  Here's another one.
[00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.392]  AP subway rider busted for selling a token.
[00:26:19.907 --> 00:26:34.970]  And it says that the individual, Donald Perrone, 42, of course, just a regular guy, no criminal record, somebody didn't have a token, and they didn't have... Well, let me just read the article.
[00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:46.413]  Atlanta Transport Police handcuffed and cited a man who sold a $1.75 subway token to another rider who was having trouble with a token vending machine.
[00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:49.869]  And the police admit they saw all this happen.
[00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:51.390]  The person said, I'll sell you this.
[00:26:52.811 --> 00:27:04.456]  And it says, Transit Authority spokesman Joyce Baker said Friday the officer acted within the law and he spotted Donald Perrone, 42, selling a token, November 30th, inside the West End subway station.
[00:27:04.496 --> 00:27:15.682]  Instead of giving Perrone a warning, the officer decided to handcuff him and give him a misdemeanor citation of 92 state law that bars passengers from selling Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority tokens, she said.
[00:27:16.423 --> 00:27:20.105]  What you've got to keep in mind is that the fair abuse is a chronic problem, Baker said.
[00:27:20.145 --> 00:27:23.647]  It costs MRTA millions of dollars every year.
[00:27:23.747 --> 00:27:24.488]  What does that mean?
[00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:31.712]  Baker acknowledged that Perrone sold the token at face value and did not make a profit, but the law is the law, she said.
[00:27:31.732 --> 00:27:41.998]  And, oh, there are customer service phones for people who are having trouble getting tokens out of the machine, she said, and we will arrest anyone seen selling tokens.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.622]  And there were a couple articles last year where a pregnant woman sits down on a bench.
[00:27:50.183 --> 00:27:52.184]  And the cop sat there for five minutes.
[00:27:52.264 --> 00:27:53.545]  The bench is only a five-minute bench.
[00:27:53.645 --> 00:27:58.907]  The minute the five minutes were up, they have time benches in New York, some areas, he arrested her.
[00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.693]  Another case of a pregnant woman sitting down on the steps by a subway entrance.
[00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.616]  They love that, particularly pregnant women having trouble walking.
[00:28:06.876 --> 00:28:12.300]  They arrested her, or the little girl who got off the bus one stop before her home.
[00:28:13.101 --> 00:28:13.721]  They arrested her.
[00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:15.603]  She was an honor student.
[00:28:16.704 --> 00:28:21.307]  She wanted some french fries that are at the stand 60 yards from her home.
[00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:22.969]  Stopped before hers, but it didn't matter.
[00:28:22.989 --> 00:28:23.569]  She was arrested.
[00:28:23.589 --> 00:28:24.490]  That was D.C., though.
[00:28:25.823 --> 00:28:38.433]  What about the girl who graduated from high school at 14 and was enrolled at college at 15, and they came and arrested her and were trying to take her because they said it was abusive that she was not given the enjoyment of public school?
[00:28:38.513 --> 00:28:40.675]  That was in the major New York papers.
[00:28:40.695 --> 00:28:41.396]  You think I'm joking?
[00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:41.956]  Just Google it.
[00:28:42.257 --> 00:28:43.498]  We interviewed the father and the girl.
[00:28:44.178 --> 00:28:46.040]  And they were basically in hiding at that time.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.880]  I never followed it up.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.582]  The CPS has been after them quite a lot.
[00:28:49.517 --> 00:28:51.978]  Got to take the child out.
[00:28:52.278 --> 00:28:53.018]  I'm not joking.
[00:28:53.418 --> 00:28:54.179]  This is not a joke.
[00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:55.579]  Tuning in for the first time.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.840]  And I've been in New York.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.962]  The police will walk up and just scream at you with spittle flying for nothing.
[00:29:02.842 --> 00:29:07.083]  If you've got congressional press passes that let you get 10 feet from the president.
[00:29:07.123 --> 00:29:11.065]  I mean, I could get down on the floor all the way up to Bush.
[00:29:12.432 --> 00:29:19.216]  But I could be anywhere in a park in the city, and cops would just march over and go, What are you doing?
[00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:21.538]  Well, a lot of it's in the film Martial Law.
[00:29:21.938 --> 00:29:23.479]  I could arrest you right now.
[00:29:23.499 --> 00:29:24.740]  I could take that pass.
[00:29:27.002 --> 00:29:29.703]  I'm here to let you know you're my slave, boy.
[00:29:29.723 --> 00:29:32.825]  Don't you ever forget it, scum.
[00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:34.386]  You work for us now.
[00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:35.147]  I mean, it was just...
[00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:44.399]  And the police union, by the way, has actually complained, has run print and TV ads saying, we're sorry, we've been ordered to be mean to you by the city.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.602]  To, quote, squeeze the people.
[00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:52.606]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.087 --> 00:29:54.708]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.609 --> 00:29:58.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.887 --> 00:30:04.488]  Government is best which governs least.
[00:30:05.048 --> 00:30:06.349]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:09.511]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:09.951 --> 00:30:12.593]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:13.033 --> 00:30:19.437]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:30:19.697 --> 00:30:20.458]  We're good to go.
[00:30:40.329 --> 00:30:41.771]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:30:41.951 --> 00:30:42.291]  Have you?
[00:30:42.872 --> 00:30:44.374]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:30:44.854 --> 00:30:48.578]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:30:48.598 --> 00:30:52.602]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:30:53.063 --> 00:30:54.104]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:30:54.664 --> 00:30:55.845]  Osama bin forgotten.
[00:30:56.306 --> 00:30:59.930]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:31:01.613 --> 00:31:03.574]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.674 --> 00:31:14.379]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:19.261]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:30.667]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.227 --> 00:31:31.728]  We're good to go.
[00:32:02.507 --> 00:32:08.869]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:14.111]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:22.314]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:29.516]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.736 --> 00:32:30.957]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:31.098 --> 00:32:34.501]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:37.224]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:32:37.444 --> 00:32:44.271]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:32:51.055 --> 00:32:54.917]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:54.977 --> 00:32:57.257]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:36.374]  Welcome back.
[00:33:37.074 --> 00:33:39.817]  And yes, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:42.199 --> 00:33:42.919]  I'm not kidding.
[00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:51.046]  I mean, every day I have stacks of articles where, for the most petty of reasons, imagine...
[00:33:51.790 --> 00:34:08.097]  Some 42-year-old businessman with no criminal record, because we've checked into him, we're getting him on as a guest, is just there at the New York subway, and the machine's broken, and he goes, and the train's coming, the person's got to get on, and he goes, here, I'll sell you $1.75.
[00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:09.217]  Great, thanks.
[00:34:09.618 --> 00:34:11.418]  Hey, Mac, what'd you do there?
[00:34:11.438 --> 00:34:13.519]  Get up against the car here.
[00:34:13.759 --> 00:34:15.300]  You're going down for that.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.581]  You know that you shouldn't be doing it.
[00:34:19.289 --> 00:34:20.429]  Well, I'm very sorry, sir.
[00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.990]  I was just trying to help the lady out.
[00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:25.611]  Yeah, well, that's not your job, is it, Matt?
[00:34:25.992 --> 00:34:27.712]  Selling somebody's tokens.
[00:34:28.092 --> 00:34:29.433]  We got rules here.
[00:34:29.833 --> 00:34:31.153]  We got lots of rules.
[00:34:31.394 --> 00:34:33.955]  And you don't follow them, you go to jail, boy.
[00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:35.035]  You got that now?
[00:34:35.175 --> 00:34:36.716]  You can learn who the boss is, boy.
[00:34:36.736 --> 00:34:38.876]  And let me tell you, I mean, the New York cops, they aren't like that.
[00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:39.677]  I got them on video.
[00:34:42.978 --> 00:34:48.500]  One of my camera guys is over there videotaping on the side of the street, across the street from the little FEMA camp,
[00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:56.535]  He's about 100 yards away, up against the barrier, and the cop runs over and goes, What are you doing filming here?
[00:34:56.555 --> 00:34:58.056]  What are you doing?
[00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.396]  And I said, Officer, it's my fault.
[00:34:59.436 --> 00:35:00.037]  He works for me.
[00:35:00.437 --> 00:35:01.838]  Was I talking to you?
[00:35:02.038 --> 00:35:04.920]  Did I talk to you more?
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.582]  Move to the Soviet Union, you piece of filth!
[00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:12.473]  Yesterday, one of my crew here goes, why don't you lay off the hillbilly accent?
[00:35:12.713 --> 00:35:14.074]  Hey boy, how you doing?
[00:35:14.795 --> 00:35:15.576]  Do your Yankee.
[00:35:15.596 --> 00:35:20.619]  We know the hillbilly is a little more closer to home and more natural for you, but we want to hear the Yankee one, so I'm going to be fair.
[00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:25.483]  For the next week, I'll be doing versions of different Yankee voices.
[00:35:25.643 --> 00:35:28.806]  No offense to our Yankee friends, it is fair.
[00:35:29.786 --> 00:35:32.268]  But imagine, just we're scum.
[00:35:32.328 --> 00:35:35.671]  It's like we live in Cuba, we live in Russia, we live in China.
[00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:41.324]  But actually, in China and Russia, a lot of times the police predominantly are very respectful.
[00:35:41.685 --> 00:35:45.086]  They will just beat you up if you back talk or anything like that, which is bad enough.
[00:35:45.146 --> 00:35:50.369]  No, no, here it's just arrogant, swaggering thugs just swaggering around.
[00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.410]  You do what I say, boy!
[00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:58.534]  Don't you talk back to me or I'll take you to jail!
[00:35:58.914 --> 00:36:00.595]  And I'm sorry to be talking like that.
[00:36:00.915 --> 00:36:02.036]  We're not your slaves.
[00:36:02.196 --> 00:36:05.858]  Just because you went and got a uniform doesn't mean you're God and we're here to serve you.
[00:36:06.983 --> 00:36:07.864]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:36:08.644 --> 00:36:16.972]  I'll tell you, compared to Dallas cops don't act like that, Houston cops don't act like that, Austin cops don't act like that, predominantly.
[00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:19.614]  I mean, some do, and they've gotten worse over the years.
[00:36:19.654 --> 00:36:30.223]  But being in New York, now, you'd see some cops who were smiling and friendly and nice, but about half of them are these frothing, insane, out-of-control individuals.
[00:36:31.073 --> 00:36:32.775]  And I have really experienced it.
[00:36:33.276 --> 00:36:37.421]  I mean, imagine, you're there with congressional press passes, calmly interviewing someone, and, what are you doing?
[00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:38.683]  I want to see your press pass!
[00:36:38.803 --> 00:36:39.844]  You know I could take this!
[00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:41.286]  I hope to a day!
[00:36:41.987 --> 00:36:45.932]  I mean, it's just so... I'm sorry to make that sound, but that's the...
[00:36:46.562 --> 00:36:51.106]  Just like a good old boy here will kind of go... It's kind of like the thing they do.
[00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:52.287]  I'm not joking about this.
[00:36:52.727 --> 00:36:54.449]  Same thing with the New World Order types in New York.
[00:36:54.469 --> 00:36:56.290]  It's like they're totally brain dead.
[00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:03.116]  They'll... There's kind of a... added to whatever they're doing because they're so mindless.
[00:37:03.136 --> 00:37:04.657]  They're so stupid.
[00:37:07.299 --> 00:37:07.920]  But listen to this.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.464]  Homeowner protests DEA action in... Ukiah.
[00:37:12.484 --> 00:37:13.665]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:37:14.528 --> 00:37:18.672]  And this is out of the Ukiah Daily Journal newspaper there.
[00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:21.975]  This is here in the United States, the DEA.
[00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:29.422]  And a lot of times I see these, and they go to the house without a warrant to shoot somebody because they're trigger happy, and then it becomes a big lawsuit.
[00:37:29.682 --> 00:37:37.630]  Oh, I heard a neocon a few nights ago on the radio, I forgot this part, going, how dare this woman whose husband was on the Prozac and got shot
[00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:40.559]  Now it turns out it didn't say bomb.
[00:37:40.939 --> 00:37:42.741]  How dare them be suing?
[00:37:42.761 --> 00:37:45.405]  I just knew these scum would sue.
[00:37:45.425 --> 00:37:49.410]  As if we shouldn't be able to defend ourselves somehow for being killed.
[00:37:50.972 --> 00:37:51.993]  Six drug enforcement...
[00:37:52.674 --> 00:38:02.322]  Administration agents invaded a resident's home Friday, threatening him with an automatic gun and searching the residence without producing documentation for the resident.
[00:38:02.743 --> 00:38:14.333]  Clay Young said he was working on the home he's building on his Running Springs Ranch property off Ore Springs Road when he realized six men had entered the structure without knocking and were pointing automatic weapons at him.
[00:38:15.013 --> 00:38:18.877]  It intimidated the bejesus out of me, Young said.
[00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:19.838]  I said, don't
[00:38:21.147 --> 00:38:22.628]  Point that thing at me.
[00:38:22.648 --> 00:38:23.449]  I was scared.
[00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:29.834]  The men did not produce search warrants or any notification, aside from letters on their jackets that read DEA.
[00:38:30.734 --> 00:38:34.237]  We've got a big problem with people posing as cops, too, so they could have been even fake.
[00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:35.418]  We have that in Austin.
[00:38:35.438 --> 00:38:37.699]  Somebody rides around raping women dressed up like APD.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:43.744]  Young said after requesting his ID, Young added, they asked to walk through his house without providing cause.
[00:38:44.365 --> 00:38:56.674]  After the search, the six men thanked Young, who later said he was glad his wife and three-year-old daughter were not home for his cooperation and drove off in an unmarked black pickup truck, he said.
[00:38:57.155 --> 00:38:59.817]  Now they've called the sheriff's department and they say there's really nothing they can do.
[00:39:03.018 --> 00:39:05.461]  And here's the thing.
[00:39:07.002 --> 00:39:10.346]  Usually, these guys probably were just thugs, not actively evil.
[00:39:10.826 --> 00:39:13.769]  A lot of times, they will take you to jail for potting soil.
[00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.774]  They'll go back in your rose garden and then go, this is drug paraphernalia.
[00:39:18.814 --> 00:39:19.615]  No drugs are found.
[00:39:20.254 --> 00:39:21.195]  Oh, you think I'm joking.
[00:39:21.235 --> 00:39:31.580]  From Texas to Oregon, I have read the articles on air, I've interviewed the guests, where they go into middle class areas, block hole neighborhoods, in one case in Oregon, and begin searching houses, house to house.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.962]  They got so mad, by the way, they have the Army National Guard with them.
[00:39:34.982 --> 00:39:37.463]  This was like four years ago, the particular case I'm talking about.
[00:39:38.144 --> 00:39:43.807]  Armored vehicles blocking the road, and when they found no drugs, they got mad and started arresting people for kitchen scales.
[00:39:44.747 --> 00:39:45.527]  Which I better watch it.
[00:39:45.547 --> 00:39:46.127]  I've got one.
[00:39:46.387 --> 00:39:47.508]  Oops, I'm going to get raided.
[00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:49.128]  I did buy it at Target.
[00:39:49.768 --> 00:39:50.469]  Actually, my wife did.
[00:39:51.149 --> 00:39:52.669]  And why not raid Target, then?
[00:39:53.209 --> 00:39:54.710]  And potting soil, folks.
[00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:59.451]  And they will take you to jail for paraphernalia, and you will serve hard jail time.
[00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:02.532]  And I don't want to hear it from cops listening, saying that isn't true.
[00:40:02.572 --> 00:40:04.673]  Type it in Google, you'll get news articles all over the country.
[00:40:05.453 --> 00:40:06.553]  I don't want to hear it from you anymore.
[00:40:06.593 --> 00:40:07.793]  Everything we say is documented.
[00:40:09.194 --> 00:40:10.514]  And then it continues here.
[00:40:10.534 --> 00:40:12.935]  I mean, this is the stuff I have every day.
[00:40:13.095 --> 00:40:13.435]  Every day.
[00:40:14.292 --> 00:40:16.593]  Bus Gestapo, Dallas Observer.
[00:40:17.613 --> 00:40:28.776]  And it just gets into how the police admit the guy walked across the street, a father and his 14-year-old son, and they got to the other end, and the cops said, walk back across the road.
[00:40:29.336 --> 00:40:33.297]  And they said, look, we jaywalked, but we can't walk back across now, the traffic.
[00:40:33.677 --> 00:40:40.579]  And the cop began screaming at them, they refused to walk back across, and so they took him to jail, handcuffed him, and they spent 11 days in jail.
[00:40:41.799 --> 00:40:43.620]  That's the Dallas newspaper, Dallas Observer.
[00:40:44.492 --> 00:40:45.693]  And I've got stacks of these.
[00:40:45.713 --> 00:40:51.079]  And then you've got stuff where it kind of is a little bit more gray, but it shows how ridiculous the drug laws are.
[00:40:53.181 --> 00:40:54.242]  This is out of CNN.
[00:40:55.644 --> 00:40:58.126]  Elderly sell pain pills for cash.
[00:40:59.788 --> 00:41:04.473]  And this is out of Prestonburg, Kentucky.
[00:41:05.325 --> 00:41:07.466]  Where they arrest people who are having Ron Paul speeches.
[00:41:07.486 --> 00:41:08.527]  I'm not kidding.
[00:41:08.867 --> 00:41:19.352]  Dottie Needle, 87, was fingerprinted, photographed, and thrown in jail and imprisoned as much by the tubing from her oxygen tank as by the concrete and steel around her.
[00:41:19.412 --> 00:41:29.297]  The woman, who spent two days in jail after her arrest last December, is among the growing number of Kentucky senior citizens charged in a crackdown on crime authorities say is rampant in Appalachia.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.642]  Well, they're so poor, they're even more poor than L.A.
[00:41:32.682 --> 00:41:33.263]  blacks, folks.
[00:41:33.723 --> 00:41:38.207]  Elderly people are reselling their painkillers and other medications to addicts.
[00:41:39.068 --> 00:41:50.538]  When a person is on Social Security drawing $500 a month, and they can sell their pain pills for $10 apiece, they'll take half of them for themselves and sell the other half to pay the electricity bills or buy groceries.
[00:41:50.998 --> 00:41:56.323]  Floyd County Jailer Roger Webb said, well, then what are you doing again?
[00:41:56.343 --> 00:41:56.383]  Ha!
[00:41:59.944 --> 00:42:03.807]  Our cops aren't supposed to be marching around looking for all of our guns we have for self-defense.
[00:42:04.107 --> 00:42:05.989]  You're not supposed to be prosecuting old ladies.
[00:42:06.509 --> 00:42:08.090]  You're like, well, them drugs are dangerous.
[00:42:08.531 --> 00:42:10.392]  None of your argument holds any water.
[00:42:10.952 --> 00:42:15.576]  You could buy any drug you wanted in doses that would kill you 80 years ago.
[00:42:16.937 --> 00:42:18.778]  In fact, about exactly 80 years ago.
[00:42:19.179 --> 00:42:20.840]  Back in the mid-1920s.
[00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.002]  This is public.
[00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:23.942]  This is admitted.
[00:42:23.962 --> 00:42:26.504]  This is in the mainstream histories.
[00:42:26.564 --> 00:42:27.385]  This is a fact.
[00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.611]  The British East India Company's U.S.
[00:42:31.711 --> 00:42:39.892]  licensee was the exclusive Russell Trust that, by the way, founded Skull & Bones and basically owns most of the endowments at Yale in 1832.
[00:42:40.932 --> 00:42:42.933]  They were losing their opium monopoly.
[00:42:43.513 --> 00:42:58.696]  They had been the predominant company shipping in Chinese and Vietnamese, which would point as a whole scope, a whole plethora of different opiums, that were sold over the counter as Lottum and many other syrups and assorted snake oils.
[00:42:59.855 --> 00:43:00.736]  We're good to go.
[00:43:00.756 --> 00:43:00.916]  I think?
[00:43:19.148 --> 00:43:19.568]  I forget.
[00:43:19.928 --> 00:43:25.991]  It's just many, many, many, many, many times more powerful by just incredible levels.
[00:43:26.011 --> 00:43:29.732]  I don't remember the exact number as opium, but side issue.
[00:43:31.413 --> 00:43:32.513]  Cocaine.
[00:43:33.193 --> 00:43:35.354]  Just every type of drug you could imagine.
[00:43:35.714 --> 00:43:37.675]  Huge bricks of marijuana.
[00:43:39.936 --> 00:43:40.636]  It was everywhere.
[00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:48.761]  And you had just dramatic... In fact, I've been working on a film with one of my friends for two and a half years on this.
[00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:53.964]  Okay, we've really done our research, and it is... Just admit it.
[00:43:54.504 --> 00:43:56.745]  We have the news articles, the documents, all of it.
[00:43:59.326 --> 00:44:02.808]  You had just a fraction of the American people on this stuff.
[00:44:04.268 --> 00:44:05.369]  But they made it illegal.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:22.408]  And the very companies that were losing their monopoly then became the main distributors of it and sicked the corrupt police that they already owned via the prohibition model during that same period to go after all of their competition.
[00:44:22.908 --> 00:44:26.090]  You know, the mayor's brother, speak easy, never got raided.
[00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.392]  And the mayor's cousin dealing all the smack, he never got raided.
[00:44:30.432 --> 00:44:31.873]  If you try to deal smack...
[00:44:32.717 --> 00:44:33.478]  You went to jail.
[00:44:33.878 --> 00:44:34.498]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:44:34.518 --> 00:44:35.119]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:44:35.299 --> 00:44:36.900]  We've got to enforce the law.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.180]  It's a war.
[00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:39.761]  It's a war.
[00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:42.803]  Okay, I promise no more of those accents for the week.
[00:44:43.784 --> 00:44:45.245]  Let me try to get into my Yankee voice.
[00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:45.705]  It's harder.
[00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:49.747]  You've got to know it's a war, Mac.
[00:44:49.907 --> 00:44:52.169]  We've got a major problem going on.
[00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:53.270]  It's serious.
[00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.271]  Do you know what drugs do to our communities?
[00:44:56.592 --> 00:44:58.072]  We've got to do something.
[00:44:59.935 --> 00:45:02.856]  War on poverty, war on crime, war on terror, war on drugs.
[00:45:03.156 --> 00:45:04.776]  And in every case, we get more of it, don't we?
[00:45:05.657 --> 00:45:06.957]  Because they control it.
[00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:10.018]  And any honest cop will tell you they know that.
[00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:12.459]  And it's just time to stop it.
[00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:16.980]  When you pull some punk kids over, if they got stolen goods, take them to jail.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.261]  But if they got some marijuana, just ignore it.
[00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:24.102]  I mean, your own government's trying to put them on Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:45:24.642 --> 00:45:26.703]  Thank God they're only on marijuana.
[00:45:29.701 --> 00:45:31.022]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.102]  It's a joke.
[00:45:32.983 --> 00:45:38.865]  And again, for the people that don't understand this, you've got companies and families that have monopolies on narcotics.
[00:45:39.386 --> 00:45:41.107]  The monopolies are being broken up.
[00:45:42.487 --> 00:45:55.073]  They moved through their agents, through the banks, through the media, through the PTA groups nationally with a big PR campaign, and it had to be, I personally seem like,
[00:45:56.156 --> 00:45:57.299]  15 different films.
[00:45:57.419 --> 00:45:58.762]  Reefer Madness is nothing, folks.
[00:45:59.082 --> 00:46:06.137]  They've got old black and white movies they made where the cowboy smokes one puff of marijuana and then goes and kills small children.
[00:46:06.966 --> 00:46:09.027]  And he takes a hit and he goes, I want to murder people.
[00:46:09.087 --> 00:46:10.447]  And he goes, it's murdering children.
[00:46:10.707 --> 00:46:12.148]  Complete opposite of what marijuana does.
[00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:15.649]  And I'm not saying marijuana's good, folks, but compared to Prozac, it's nothing.
[00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.990]  Actually, Prozac is what does that sometimes.
[00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:18.791]  That's what's funny.
[00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:28.274]  Here, take the thing that will actually make you do that, but then we're going to... So they ran all these TVs and newsreels and shorts that aired before movies for year after year.
[00:46:29.015 --> 00:46:34.557]  And then the cops went from George Washington smoking marijuana, which he did smoke, folks.
[00:46:34.597 --> 00:46:34.977]  He grew it.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:44.884]  Not just for rope or clothing, but they grew the type of hemp, type of cannabis that actually would get you stoned, as they say, as the little hippies say.
[00:46:46.745 --> 00:46:53.087]  And I know I'm preaching, and I've kind of gone off down another rabbit trail on this subject, but it's got to stop, folks.
[00:46:53.848 --> 00:46:54.708]  It's got to stop.
[00:46:54.768 --> 00:46:59.390]  It went from marijuana being sold in the Southwest over the counter...
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.085]  Kind of a forgotten drug on the East Coast where it was once quite popular amongst the Founding Fathers and other people.
[00:47:08.346 --> 00:47:09.807]  But it was mainly a medicinal herb.
[00:47:09.867 --> 00:47:15.852]  If you had a headache or you had a stomachache, you were supposed to smoke and take a long draw off your pipe.
[00:47:15.892 --> 00:47:19.195]  You'd go to the local herb expert or go to your local doctor.
[00:47:19.215 --> 00:47:24.079]  That's what doctors mainly did was give you tinctures and different herbs and different drugs, natural drugs.
[00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:27.281]  And they'd say, okay, take this home and take long drafts off of it.
[00:47:27.702 --> 00:47:30.224]  Smoke you a few bowls and that should deal with your nausea.
[00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:35.974]  And it's in memoirs, it's in books, and George Washington would sit down and smoke himself some marijuana.
[00:47:36.334 --> 00:47:40.215]  Well, I mean, in the 50s and 60s, folks, you'd get life in prison for marijuana.
[00:47:40.795 --> 00:47:46.417]  There are still people in jail for having a pound or so of marijuana from the 60s.
[00:47:46.837 --> 00:47:50.799]  But axe murderers and people like that, what's the average murderer get in America?
[00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:51.659]  Four and a half years?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.601]  Again, they've got it all figured out.
[00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:57.601]  I don't want to hear it anymore.
[00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:00.582]  So we go from George Washington smoking marijuana
[00:48:02.472 --> 00:48:08.176]  Because he's Al-Qaeda, I guess, as FEMA says, to the other end of the political spectrum.
[00:48:09.257 --> 00:48:21.145]  The other far extreme of people serving 50 years in prison for selling marijuana because everybody saw the TV shows and the dramas and the newsreels.
[00:48:21.805 --> 00:48:22.986]  Didn't even have TV at that time.
[00:48:23.046 --> 00:48:25.167]  The movie productions.
[00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:27.129]  You really ought to see these.
[00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:28.460]  We're good to go.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.000]  We're good to go.
[00:48:50.716 --> 00:48:56.781]  Others are just 15 minutes long little propaganda pieces they would air before the movies.
[00:48:56.801 --> 00:49:03.106]  And imagine the families go sit down and this is an official production financed by the FBI.
[00:49:03.426 --> 00:49:05.888]  Prepare yourselves to watch the evil.
[00:49:05.908 --> 00:49:08.530]  And the person, I'm going to kill.
[00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:10.651]  Murder.
[00:49:11.232 --> 00:49:12.693]  Just total baloney.
[00:49:13.113 --> 00:49:15.355]  Well, the propaganda today really hasn't changed.
[00:49:16.115 --> 00:49:16.576]  They have the...
[00:49:18.001 --> 00:49:26.747]  National Ad Council ads where they're sitting around the dinner table at some fine restaurant, and there's the really cool-looking intellectual type, and the guy goes, you know, I smoke marijuana sometimes.
[00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:28.208]  I'm not funding terrorists.
[00:49:29.108 --> 00:49:30.249]  Are you sure you aren't?
[00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.932]  Marijuana's connected to massive funding of terrorists.
[00:49:34.312 --> 00:49:35.813]  Oh, gosh, I didn't know I was an idiot.
[00:49:36.133 --> 00:49:37.074]  Well, you are an idiot.
[00:49:37.314 --> 00:49:38.655]  Everybody laughs at him at the table.
[00:49:39.255 --> 00:49:41.036]  Oh, you're funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:41.497 --> 00:49:45.139]  And again, folks, I don't use anything
[00:49:45.914 --> 00:49:52.800]  I can't stand drugs other than coffee, which I'm sure they'll get around to banning, which they probably should.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.542]  You're talking about much more serious drugs than marijuana.
[00:49:56.803 --> 00:49:58.324]  I've almost got myself off of it again.
[00:50:01.607 --> 00:50:04.509]  The point is, this is all baloney.
[00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.871]  It's all baloney.
[00:50:07.632 --> 00:50:09.233]  It's all ridiculous.
[00:50:09.994 --> 00:50:10.815]  On its face.
[00:50:12.756 --> 00:50:13.537]  It's a joke.
[00:50:15.565 --> 00:50:24.952]  And by making drugs illegal, they energize the criminal gangs, they make it a black market, they make it fashionable, they make it trendy, and your kids use it.
[00:50:25.372 --> 00:50:40.623]  And so for all the young people out there, if you don't want to put money directly into George Bush's bank account, directly into the Rothschild and Rockefeller bank accounts, directly into Skull and Bones, Russell Trust's bank account, do not smoke marijuana, do not use cocaine, do not take any of their drugs.
[00:50:42.244 --> 00:50:43.745]  Don't use any of it.
[00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:45.370]  You want to hurt them?
[00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:52.873]  They run ads about drugs that don't... Because all the studies show when you run ads saying don't do drugs, it actually causes people to use them.
[00:50:53.153 --> 00:50:56.015]  It's like their suicide education actually increases suicide.
[00:50:56.555 --> 00:50:58.176]  Just don't do what they want.
[00:50:58.296 --> 00:50:59.796]  Don't use their drugs.
[00:51:02.634 --> 00:51:05.476]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.736 --> 00:51:06.437]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.537 --> 00:51:07.317]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.657 --> 00:51:12.340]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:19.425]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.745 --> 00:51:21.725]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.926 --> 00:51:24.766]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.846 --> 00:51:29.507]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.727 --> 00:51:34.108]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.368 --> 00:51:41.590]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.251]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:05.783]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:06.003 --> 00:52:11.445]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[00:52:22.249 --> 00:52:26.591]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.791 --> 00:52:27.651]  Try Halo Methane.
[00:52:27.871 --> 00:52:35.133]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:35.413 --> 00:52:41.774]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:46.356]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:53:48.027 --> 00:53:51.128]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.288 --> 00:53:57.230]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.631 --> 00:54:10.714]  I'm sure you've heard about the family.
[00:54:10.734 --> 00:54:12.755]  They're big bush supporters, big water supporters.
[00:54:12.775 --> 00:54:13.955]  Their son died in Iraq.
[00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:23.276]  They shipped him back as freight with a bunch of luggage and literally Christmas gifts with no color guard, no honor guard, no nothing.
[00:54:23.636 --> 00:54:28.680]  And they're mad about it, and sure enough, neocons have been on the air going, They're probably dirty commie rats.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.562]  They're probably libs.
[00:54:31.883 --> 00:54:33.564]  I mean, why did the troops always get that in the past?
[00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:34.225]  Now they don't.
[00:54:34.245 --> 00:54:36.606]  You've got to think about that.
[00:54:36.626 --> 00:54:38.688]  I'm probably with them, though.
[00:54:38.728 --> 00:54:42.771]  See, I'm probably evil just criticizing him.
[00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:44.252]  Look, there's so much news here today.
[00:54:44.292 --> 00:54:45.053]  I know I'm ranting.
[00:54:45.686 --> 00:54:48.067]  We're going to go to Kurt and Pat and Tom and others here in just a moment.
[00:54:49.028 --> 00:54:52.169]  We're going to have open phones throughout the next hour with a spattering of news.
[00:54:52.229 --> 00:54:53.630]  Then Morgan Reynolds joins us.
[00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.792]  Just briefly, I do want to tell you, Christmas is coming up, and we ship it out to you.
[00:54:57.912 --> 00:55:02.995]  UPS, ladies and gentlemen, order now, and you'll be able to get it long before Christmas, by the 20th.
[00:55:04.035 --> 00:55:05.756]  Only coming up here in about seven days.
[00:55:06.076 --> 00:55:15.061]  We won't be able to get it to you by Christmas, but if you want to go to InfoWars.com and order via the safe, secure shopping cart, and then put in your friend or family member's address,
[00:55:16.724 --> 00:55:23.487]  We will mail the DVDs or VHS or T-shirts or books on tape or whatever you want to order directly to them.
[00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:28.009]  And then you can send them a card or call them and tell them that it's coming.
[00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.130]  So give the gift of the truth.
[00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:31.431]  Give the gift of information.
[00:55:31.531 --> 00:55:32.131]  Educate them.
[00:55:32.432 --> 00:55:36.153]  Go to InfoWars.com and order some of the DVDs or some of the films.
[00:55:36.794 --> 00:55:38.354]  My new film, Order of Death, is out.
[00:55:38.374 --> 00:55:44.677]  And when you get it, you also get the remastered, re-edited, updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove absolutely free.
[00:55:44.697 --> 00:55:45.838]  So both films together.
[00:55:47.483 --> 00:55:48.024]  We're good to go.
[00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:05.011]  It's all on Infowars.com, or call toll-free.
[00:56:05.051 --> 00:56:06.972]  They can answer all your questions.
[00:56:06.992 --> 00:56:09.353]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:18.337]  And we've got holiday specials, Christmas specials, on PrisonPlanet.tv, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:56:19.037 --> 00:56:24.539]  You can get five months free until the end of the year when you get a yearly subscription.
[00:56:24.579 --> 00:56:25.460]  Yes, you heard me right.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.221]  Almost half a year, close to half a year free,
[00:56:29.817 --> 00:56:32.399]  At prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.961]  Let's go to Kurt in Tennessee.
[00:56:34.021 --> 00:56:34.681]  Kurt, go ahead.
[00:56:37.984 --> 00:56:38.725]  No, you don't watch.
[00:56:39.025 --> 00:56:39.706]  I'm in Texas.
[00:56:39.826 --> 00:56:49.714]  I know you don't watch TV that much, so I thought I'd give you some in-your-face police state propaganda that I saw this morning.
[00:56:49.754 --> 00:56:53.117]  I turned it on to see the news and it happened to be on Fox.
[00:56:54.045 --> 00:56:55.346]  Got the movie The Practice.
[00:56:55.386 --> 00:57:05.851]  They had a woman up there, supposedly on the storyboard, that had been pushed by a policeman and fought back, being pushed into a free speech zone at a demonstration.
[00:57:07.351 --> 00:57:11.353]  She said she thought the whole country should be a free speech zone.
[00:57:12.114 --> 00:57:13.414]  The judge says, not so.
[00:57:13.474 --> 00:57:16.235]  I give you eight years in maximum security prison.
[00:57:16.275 --> 00:57:19.937]  Said, we don't have the world that we used to have.
[00:57:20.057 --> 00:57:21.638]  Said, we've had two presidents.
[00:57:22.987 --> 00:57:36.333]  So they advertised on a Fox TV show that we all need eight years in prison if we're protesting.
[00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:39.194]  I mean, you don't even really get that in communist China.
[00:57:39.294 --> 00:57:40.975]  Usually it's two years of re-education.
[00:57:41.835 --> 00:57:42.596]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:57:42.656 --> 00:57:43.236]  You're kidding me.
[00:57:43.276 --> 00:57:44.196]  What show was this on?
[00:57:44.757 --> 00:57:47.658]  The Practice Daily Series.
[00:57:49.469 --> 00:57:51.030]  And I guess this is the new series.
[00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:52.970]  I hope somebody will tape that for me.
[00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.951]  I didn't have a tape in or I would have taped it for you.
[00:57:57.072 --> 00:58:02.554]  They said we've got to have the red and yellow alerts now.
[00:58:02.874 --> 00:58:07.276]  And said those people that want the good old days, said they're gone.
[00:58:08.817 --> 00:58:13.180]  Anytime you touch a police officer, you've committed a crime.
[00:58:13.661 --> 00:58:14.642]  Well, that's the new thing.
[00:58:14.682 --> 00:58:15.963]  I've seen it on video after video.
[00:58:16.023 --> 00:58:18.545]  They grab you, then they charge you.
[00:58:18.865 --> 00:58:23.829]  They feel good sending you to prison, ruining your life, because your hand might touch them.
[00:58:23.889 --> 00:58:25.730]  Oh, I'm a god, I'm a god, it's over.
[00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.831]  Well, good.
[00:58:26.971 --> 00:58:30.033]  Wait until the cop's mommy in another city goes to jail.
[00:58:30.614 --> 00:58:32.515]  You see, everybody gets to stay there.
[00:58:32.535 --> 00:58:34.337]  I want to hear more about this, Kurt.
[00:58:34.837 --> 00:58:36.218]  Oh, yes, eight years.
[00:58:36.438 --> 00:58:37.019]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.593 --> 00:58:45.498]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.819 --> 00:58:46.620]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.575 --> 00:58:58.216]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.876 --> 00:58:59.937]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.658 --> 00:59:01.759]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.221]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.981 --> 00:59:04.862]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.882 --> 00:59:09.226]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.727 --> 00:59:13.851]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.292 --> 00:59:21.398]  The government paid for newsreels and documentaries and little propaganda pieces for a decade.
[00:59:22.213 --> 00:59:27.758]  Saying that if you smoke marijuana, it would cause you to murder the police and kill everyone, and that you'd deserve life in prison.
[00:59:28.618 --> 00:59:34.483]  And they went from marijuana being totally legal to putting people in jail for 50-plus years for marijuana.
[00:59:34.823 --> 00:59:40.888]  And the caller, Kurt, said he was watching the show The Practice on Fox this morning, and there's a free speech zone.
[00:59:40.908 --> 00:59:43.991]  They're not allowing this lady to protest, and so they push her back in the zone.
[00:59:44.531 --> 00:59:47.734]  And I guess she touches the God, touches the God creature, the cop.
[00:59:48.374 --> 00:59:51.136]  And so the judge says, well, things have changed for 9-11.
[00:59:52.546 --> 00:59:54.288]  And our great leaders are very important.
[00:59:54.308 --> 00:59:56.090]  So you get eight years in federal prison.
[00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:59.635]  Is that what the show specifically said there, Curt, in Texas?
[00:59:59.655 --> 01:00:02.518]  I get eight years in maximum security prison.
[01:00:03.079 --> 01:00:11.589]  And you're saying maximum security for fighting back at a police officer when he pushes me?
[01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:14.307]  You know, I think.
[01:00:14.727 --> 01:00:16.229]  And so the show was a good moral.
[01:00:16.249 --> 01:00:17.711]  They're saying, see, this is normal.
[01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:19.033]  We've all got a present here.
[01:00:19.253 --> 01:00:22.418]  They're trying to... Hey, listen, listen.
[01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:26.263]  They gave a guy 44 years for kicking a police dog in the face.
[01:00:26.884 --> 01:00:27.244]  They arrested...
[01:00:27.244 --> 01:00:32.848]  If people don't think that the parties are the same, I've heard you talking about the Clintons and Bushes being the same right after George Bush died.
[01:00:56.007 --> 01:01:00.528]  was elected, and Hillary Clinton was a freshman senator.
[01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:04.089]  He visited a foreign country.
[01:01:04.129 --> 01:01:05.230]  They had it on TV.
[01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:13.552]  He came down the stairs from Air Force One, and I figured, well, Barbara Bush will, or Laura Bush will be following him next.
[01:01:14.312 --> 01:01:18.393]  Down the steps right behind him came Hillary Clinton.
[01:01:18.533 --> 01:01:24.015]  Freshman senators are not usually invited to go with the president on Air Force One.
[01:01:26.755 --> 01:01:28.036]  Well, they're lavishing her.
[01:01:28.136 --> 01:01:29.477]  Now, how did the show end?
[01:01:29.497 --> 01:01:33.499]  The show ended with, she gets eight years in maximum security for touching a god.
[01:01:33.539 --> 01:01:36.201]  She gets eight years in maximum security.
[01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:44.627]  It's a lawyer-type program, and they were discussing, well, you know, they tried to defend her, but, you know, it was such a great thing.
[01:01:45.207 --> 01:01:50.691]  And when she protested about the eight years, well, the judge left the bench and just
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:57.103]  Oh yeah, he's got the power.
[01:01:57.143 --> 01:01:58.803]  It feels good ruining lives.
[01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.724]  Oh yes, oh.
[01:02:00.964 --> 01:02:03.165]  Meanwhile, most of these judges are on the payroll.
[01:02:03.646 --> 01:02:08.628]  Most of them are living in houses ten times more expensive than they should be, lavishing themselves.
[01:02:08.688 --> 01:02:10.629]  I'm so sick of you criminal scum.
[01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:14.650]  Listen, it's just criminals that take it over, and they're looking for excuses to rape us.
[01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:15.151]  That's it.
[01:02:15.511 --> 01:02:15.971]  That's it.
[01:02:17.012 --> 01:02:17.872]  None of us are safe.
[01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:26.022]  Every day I see articles with judges and lawyers and congressmen dealing drugs, money laundering, scamming.
[01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.784]  It's made a bunch of crooks.
[01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:28.905]  True.
[01:02:29.325 --> 01:02:29.645]  There are.
[01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:30.726]  I mean, let's just say it together.
[01:02:30.766 --> 01:02:33.589]  You're a bunch of dirty crooks and we know it and your time's coming.
[01:02:33.889 --> 01:02:35.411]  Yes, you're a bunch of dirty crooks.
[01:02:36.011 --> 01:02:37.693]  We know it and your time is coming.
[01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.230]  It always does.
[01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:41.531]  Listen, they feed and they feed and they feed.
[01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:45.012]  The parasites do until the host gets so sick it throws them off.
[01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:48.134]  Or the host dies, and either way, the maggots go down.
[01:02:48.334 --> 01:02:49.554]  You're going down, maggots.
[01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:50.274]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:51.155 --> 01:02:52.815]  I'm sorry if I'm getting mad, folks.
[01:02:54.716 --> 01:02:59.818]  Listen, I don't watch much TV, but I read the little synopsis that goes with all the TV shows.
[01:02:59.858 --> 01:03:03.119]  It's just, a woman believes there's a world government.
[01:03:03.159 --> 01:03:05.340]  CPS takes her kids because she's a terrorist.
[01:03:06.096 --> 01:03:06.537]  I mean, I don't...
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:37.455]  Once a month, I'll lay in bed late at night, and I'll flip around to the TV channels, and every channel, they're torturing people, world government's good, guns are bad.
[01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:40.257]  I mean, this stuff is propaganda off the hook.
[01:03:42.358 --> 01:03:45.660]  Again, most of the propaganda is in the TV shows and the movies.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.701]  It's not on the news.
[01:03:48.022 --> 01:03:48.682]  Heaven help us.
[01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:49.523]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.283 --> 01:04:00.107]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.427 --> 01:04:01.787]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.988 --> 01:04:04.209]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:06.430]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:11.653]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.993 --> 01:04:16.015]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:18.036]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:28.762]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.923 --> 01:04:30.804]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:00.431]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:00.851 --> 01:06:03.512]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:03.952 --> 01:06:10.414]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:33.806 --> 01:06:35.307]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:06:45.586 --> 01:06:46.747]  Osama been forgotten.

[01:06:56.335 --> 01:06:59.718]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.758 --> 01:07:11.448]  Warren Reynolds, Chief Economist, Department of Labor.
[01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:12.029]  Labor.
[01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:27.109]  For the current Bush administration, the current Bush, he was in there, what, just two years ago, very conservative libertarian track record, coming on to join us.
[01:07:27.149 --> 01:07:34.535]  We first interviewed him, I don't know, six, eight months ago, about 9-11 and some of the blaring inconsistencies and clear evidence of
[01:07:35.413 --> 01:07:35.553]  Hello?
[01:07:35.573 --> 01:07:35.673]  Yes.
[01:07:35.693 --> 01:07:37.154]  Alex, I have two major questions.
[01:07:37.174 --> 01:07:40.154]  I was looking at George Humphrey's tape, and he mentioned about these 18 scientists
[01:08:02.757 --> 01:08:10.644]  These 18 prominent scientists that mysteriously died within a 14-month period after 9-11, have there been any update on that?
[01:08:10.664 --> 01:08:12.825]  On what has happened?
[01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:18.290]  Well, he only focuses on a few of the microbiologists that have died and now it's upwards of 200.
[01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:18.590]  200 scientists?
[01:08:22.068 --> 01:08:35.614]  Particularly of one discipline, and that is molecular biologists who are experts in producing bioweapons or treating bioweapons or identifying the source of a given pathogenic agent.
[01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:40.176]  Okay, these are the ones.
[01:08:40.196 --> 01:08:43.237]  The ones he mentioned were related to the anthrax.
[01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:48.099]  Yes, specifically the anthrax attack
[01:08:49.317 --> 01:08:52.838]  Of course, it was another government operation, and we can conclusively prove that.
[01:08:52.858 --> 01:08:59.280]  Right, and he mentioned when he was 18 that he mysteriously died within a 14-month period.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:04.001]  Now, that tape was made a couple years ago, and George is making the connection to anthrax.
[01:09:04.181 --> 01:09:16.965]  I'm making a larger discussion of the 180-plus, last time I looked, it's getting close to 200 microbiologists that are being assassinated and killed all over the country.
[01:09:18.218 --> 01:09:18.839]  Why is that?
[01:09:18.879 --> 01:09:19.820]  Why are they being killed?
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.461]  Because of the anthrax, you think?
[01:09:22.122 --> 01:09:25.906]  Well, you know, that's a big question, Pat, and I appreciate your call.
[01:09:26.126 --> 01:09:28.328]  Let me try to answer that for you as best I can.
[01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:41.500]  Why is a microbiologist who's an expert in bioweapons walking outside the university down there in Houston on a street where cars are supposed to go 10 miles an hour...
[01:09:44.131 --> 01:09:51.357]  And the car, the truck, to be specific, the van, runs over him and then backs back over him.
[01:09:52.037 --> 01:10:03.346]  Or why does a microbiologist in Virginia get tied down in a giant pentagram carved on his back and then had his heart cut out?
[01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.787]  That was in the Washington Post, by the way.
[01:10:05.228 --> 01:10:08.910]  Why are microbiologists being shot in the head twice, double-tapped?
[01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.812]  Why are they...
[01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:19.924]  Are there cars being found parked in the woods and they're drowned in one foot of water, face down with signs of a struggle?
[01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:33.153]  Dr. David McKellie was the head of Porton Down Bio-Weapons Lab, not just Chief Inspector, and he died and said, they told me if I don't shut up I'll be found dead in the woods, and then he was found dead in the woods.
[01:10:33.213 --> 01:10:39.658]  It's like Princess Diana says, if I don't shut up, Prince Charles says, he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[01:10:40.288 --> 01:10:43.771]  And that's mainstream news, but oh, there's no connection to Charles.
[01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:45.772]  Of course, they're finally having to question him.
[01:10:45.812 --> 01:10:47.533]  I know that's not a microbiologist case.
[01:10:47.613 --> 01:10:50.736]  It's just another case of where they say how they're going to be killed.
[01:10:51.316 --> 01:10:53.057]  Dr. David Kelly had his wrist slashed.
[01:10:53.518 --> 01:10:55.159]  There was no blood at the scene to speak of.
[01:10:55.899 --> 01:11:01.383]  And he had two undissolved painkillers in his stomach, which they claimed he was trying to kill himself with.
[01:11:01.463 --> 01:11:08.148]  And then local police came up on the scene and saw five men in black uniforms run off, and they were told just to drop it.
[01:11:09.469 --> 01:11:10.129]  We're good to go.
[01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:38.630]  On the statistical chance of that happening, and it was something like 1 out of 14-something billion, so pretty much impossible.
[01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:43.294]  And now it's been a whole other hassle of them dying.
[01:11:43.654 --> 01:11:49.700]  It's in Australia, it's in Russia, they go in airlocks and die, or they get shot in the head, or they get run over.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.023]  And it's really, really scary.
[01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:56.800]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:00.622]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom and San Fran.
[01:12:00.662 --> 01:12:01.342]  Tom, go ahead.
[01:12:01.682 --> 01:12:02.263]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[01:12:02.363 --> 01:12:04.364]  I just had a couple of comments for you.
[01:12:04.984 --> 01:12:09.066]  One is this comment that Bush made about the Constitution.
[01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:18.930]  Now, if that turns out, you know, if he did say that, does that mean he's reneged his presidency since that's what he signs the oath of allegiance to and whatnot?
[01:12:19.995 --> 01:12:20.916]  Well, that's the point.
[01:12:20.976 --> 01:12:24.740]  We know Bush goes into a rage any time he's questioned.
[01:12:25.361 --> 01:12:26.322]  That's mainstream news.
[01:12:26.362 --> 01:12:27.423]  That's admitted.
[01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:34.190]  We know that his attorney general says the Constitution's outmoded and quaint and a living, breathing document.
[01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:38.955]  We know that the rest of his cabinet has been caught at one time or another making similar statements.
[01:12:39.315 --> 01:12:42.919]  We have him on video flipping off the news camera, screaming at his staff.
[01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:49.002]  So we know all that's happened in the past, but the globalists are trying to get us to focus in on the G.D.
[01:12:49.082 --> 01:12:49.542]  comment.
[01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:50.863]  It's not just the G.D.
[01:12:50.943 --> 01:12:55.025]  comment by itself, oh, he said G.D., it's that he said G.D.
[01:12:55.366 --> 01:12:58.687]  about the Constitution and said it's just a piece of paper.
[01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:03.010]  Well, yeah, what I'm saying is that if that's true, then is there a case to be made for it?
[01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:07.960]  You know, that he's basically, like, dishonored?
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:22.666]  Well, regardless, exactly, regardless of the fact that he did call it a GED piece of paper, which he clearly did, regardless of that fact, he's already openly and publicly been eviscerating the Bill of Rights and Constitution and dismantling it in front of our very eyes.
[01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.847]  So, look, I'm all for impeachment.
[01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:25.727]  I've been for impeachment.
[01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:28.388]  But I think it's a really good point you bring up.
[01:13:29.588 --> 01:13:30.869]  Not that we want Cheney in there, but...
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.501]  Well, no, I mean, Cheney, Bush, all of them need to go.
[01:13:35.301 --> 01:13:38.122]  Hillary Clinton needs to be indicted for all of her crimes.
[01:13:38.342 --> 01:13:44.464]  But George Bush told Congressman Dan Burton that he was going to block anything he tried to do, leave Bill Clinton alone.
[01:13:44.484 --> 01:13:48.665]  Hey, I had something else on a different subject on Bob Barr that you had on last week.
[01:13:48.685 --> 01:13:49.045]  Yes.
[01:13:49.646 --> 01:13:55.428]  No, it's just interesting that the first thing you said was, hey, yeah, great, we listened to you, or, you know, you mentioned that, like, as if you was a listener.
[01:13:55.448 --> 01:13:56.508]  I mean, what do you think of that?
[01:13:56.528 --> 01:13:56.808]  Do you...
[01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:09.703]  You know, it's humbling that almost every senatorial office or congressional office we call, or when we call up, you know, back when he was still doing interviews, Charlton Heston knew who we were.
[01:14:11.683 --> 01:14:12.623]  I'm not tooting our horn.
[01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:14.244]  I didn't make a big deal out of it at the time.
[01:14:14.264 --> 01:14:15.285]  You bring up the point.
[01:14:15.705 --> 01:14:24.969]  It's humbling, because I don't think I'm the best in the world here, but it is humbling to have websites that get tens of millions of individual visitors.
[01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:26.730]  Not just hits, visitors.
[01:14:27.351 --> 01:14:28.491]  Actual individuals.
[01:14:28.591 --> 01:14:29.432]  It is humbling.
[01:14:30.152 --> 01:14:43.059]  To know that we are on dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations across the country, and just this week we've had, what, five affiliates, new affiliates that are signing on, that are signing affiliate relations agreements.
[01:14:43.699 --> 01:14:57.226]  It is humbling to, yeah, to call up Bob Barron in his office, and he, and even off there, I talk to him more, that he's heard the show, seen some of the films, reads the website, and agrees with a lot of it.
[01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:01.335]  I mean, he was off-air telling me about different articles he'd read.
[01:15:02.576 --> 01:15:04.659]  Speaking of, you said other affiliates.
[01:15:04.679 --> 01:15:06.361]  Do you have one for San Francisco area yet?
[01:15:06.381 --> 01:15:07.202]  I heard you talk about it before.
[01:15:07.222 --> 01:15:07.643]  No, we don't.
[01:15:07.663 --> 01:15:09.545]  We have one affiliate in between L.A.
[01:15:10.126 --> 01:15:11.888]  and San Diego, and that's...
[01:15:13.129 --> 01:15:19.133]  Should be listed on the site, but we've had other stations try to call up and knock our affiliates off or steal them, so we took them down.
[01:15:19.594 --> 01:15:23.796]  So then it's kind of a guessing game to figure out where all our stations are.
[01:15:24.257 --> 01:15:33.463]  And then we've got another one way up north in northern California, and we are on the verge of getting another affiliate.
[01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:38.747]  It looks like in a little town, but it covers a bunch of other small towns, in Needles.
[01:15:39.427 --> 01:15:40.948]  California is on the verge.
[01:15:40.988 --> 01:15:47.913]  But no, San Francisco, we have been approached by stations in San Francisco without even calling them, but we're just too controversial.
[01:15:48.173 --> 01:15:56.339]  It's too controversial to actually... Actually, look, I could be a fake Neal O'Connor, a liberal, and be on ten times the stations I'm on now.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.522]  But then I wouldn't be effective and be a bunch of baloney.
[01:16:01.322 --> 01:16:02.283]  So I really could care less.
[01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:04.789]  Anything else?
[01:16:05.329 --> 01:16:06.089]  No, that's about it, man.
[01:16:06.109 --> 01:16:07.130]  I'll let you go to the other calls.
[01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:08.010]  Thanks a lot.
[01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.990]  Thank you, Tom.
[01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:11.631]  And listen, we're on Global Shortwave.
[01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:13.251]  It comes in great in San Francisco.
[01:16:13.291 --> 01:16:15.872]  You can buy a little $50 shortwave.
[01:16:15.912 --> 01:16:16.692]  It'll come in pretty good.
[01:16:16.732 --> 01:16:17.112]  Buy a $100 one.
[01:16:17.192 --> 01:16:21.253]  It'll come in like gangbusters, day and night most days, unless there's sunspots.
[01:16:21.353 --> 01:16:23.014]  Even those can screw up even AM radio.
[01:16:23.794 --> 01:16:26.715]  And you can always listen via the Internet at Infowars.com.
[01:16:28.553 --> 01:16:32.196]  Though we've been going through some growing pains and are having to update servers and add stuff there.
[01:16:32.776 --> 01:16:34.017]  Had a few hiccups the last few weeks.
[01:16:34.037 --> 01:16:35.158]  We apologize about that.
[01:16:35.198 --> 01:16:41.063]  But when you've got hundreds of thousands of people, and the Internet's a small part of our audience, but it's a dedicated one.
[01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:42.564]  Hundreds of thousands.
[01:16:43.885 --> 01:16:51.471]  We've got, what, four streams to the show, and routinely one of my streams is number one on Shoutcast out of 3,500 stations and networks.
[01:16:54.908 --> 01:17:01.212]  You know, stuff like USA Radio Network will have 500 listeners, and one of our streams will have thousands.
[01:17:03.313 --> 01:17:04.714]  And we've got a whole bunch of streams.
[01:17:05.934 --> 01:17:07.675]  And that doesn't even count all the streams.
[01:17:07.996 --> 01:17:12.538]  But that's a very small part of our audience, but it's a key demonstratable part of our audience.
[01:17:13.078 --> 01:17:19.582]  And then that Internet audience can lobby local AM and FM stations in your area to pick us up.
[01:17:19.622 --> 01:17:20.943]  Don't waste your time with the big...
[01:17:21.701 --> 01:17:25.423]  Clear Channels and other stations like that.
[01:17:25.443 --> 01:17:29.226]  I've talked to a lot of Clear Channel program directors.
[01:17:29.246 --> 01:17:30.747]  They're like, oh, no, we know your show gets ratings.
[01:17:31.287 --> 01:17:32.268]  We know you get listeners.
[01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:35.590]  We know it's compelling and time-fit listings are long.
[01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:39.112]  We've seen numbers, but the higher-ups won't have you on.
[01:17:41.393 --> 01:17:43.615]  But that's not even so much a conspiracy as it is.
[01:17:43.995 --> 01:17:45.776]  Clear Channel syndicates its own programming.
[01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.729]  We're good to go.
[01:18:16.696 --> 01:18:18.116]  This stuff really is going on.
[01:18:18.837 --> 01:18:20.197]  And we do stand up for the little guy.
[01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:21.177]  We're not backing off.
[01:18:21.217 --> 01:18:22.217]  We're not mentioning words.
[01:18:22.257 --> 01:18:23.918]  We don't script what we say.
[01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:24.698]  We're not afraid.
[01:18:25.478 --> 01:18:31.000]  And despite all my foibles and all the things I don't like about my own show, people do like it.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.480]  So I'm always honored by that.
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:33.620]  But I am humbled.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.061]  But I don't want to keep talking about myself.
[01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:36.821]  You brought it up.
[01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.642]  It is encouraging, though, to know we're having this effect.
[01:18:41.262 --> 01:18:43.623]  Mark and Brenda and many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:18:43.663 --> 01:18:44.783]  And there's a ton of other news.
[01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:51.306]  Diebold's CEO resigns from reports of fraud, litigation, and internal woes.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.800]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:01.581]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:19:01.861 --> 01:19:07.662]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:19:07.882 --> 01:19:11.943]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:19:12.223 --> 01:19:17.864]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:19:17.984 --> 01:19:20.605]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:19:22.705 --> 01:19:26.606]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:19:26.646 --> 01:19:29.026]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:19:29.366 --> 01:19:31.667]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:19:32.047 --> 01:19:35.668]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:19:36.148 --> 01:19:42.349]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:19:42.789 --> 01:19:43.749]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:19:43.769 --> 01:19:44.550]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:23:05.164 --> 01:23:06.525]  Let's go to Bart in Houston.
[01:23:06.585 --> 01:23:08.226]  Bart, you're on the air.
[01:23:08.246 --> 01:23:08.607]  Welcome.
[01:23:08.627 --> 01:23:09.567]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:09.647 --> 01:23:13.830]  I was calling in today because I really wanted to try and get some of your advice.
[01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:31.122]  When you were dealing with all of the problems at Austin Public Access, when essentially the board was trying to sell out, I was watching one of the old Prison Planet monologues that you did where you were talking about that, and I'm trying to understand what legal action...
[01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:44.317]  We could take against our board down here because we're in a very similar situation where the board here in Houston for Houston Media Source, the public access station down here, is operating on a completely different agenda that's not beneficial.
[01:23:44.357 --> 01:23:50.122]  Well, what we did is that we took them to court, and the reason doesn't even really matter that much, to get them into discovery.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:54.404]  And then we discovered clear evidence of fraud.
[01:23:54.424 --> 01:23:56.166]  It blew up in the newspaper.
[01:23:56.927 --> 01:24:05.417]  And then the city unseated the original chartered board, but it wasn't the same people, and removed them.
[01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:10.784]  And now a new group is in there and starting to act strange as well, so we're having to keep our eyes on them.
[01:24:11.892 --> 01:24:16.254]  But I had to go spend a bunch of money, and I had to spend a lot of time.
[01:24:16.274 --> 01:24:21.336]  I had to go to a whole bunch of telecommunications meetings, because I believe in free speech, and I believe in AXS TV.
[01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:32.000]  The birthplace of AXS TV globally was here in Austin, Texas, 33 plus, it's probably 34 years ago, and we successfully defeated them.
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:37.162]  But now Rick Perry's gone to the state legislature with a law that would just let him shut them down now.
[01:24:37.882 --> 01:24:40.265]  So they're very upset about it.
[01:24:40.746 --> 01:24:41.647]  It's really upsetting them.
[01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:44.490]  And again, folks, it doesn't cost you a dollar of tax money.
[01:24:45.031 --> 01:24:49.717]  When you pay that $45 on average cable bill in your city to give them a monopoly right away...
[01:24:50.992 --> 01:25:00.636]  Then they have to pay on average about 34 cents out of the bill to have county and city meetings on TV and then a channel for the locals to come down and soapbox.
[01:25:00.936 --> 01:25:05.218]  And I don't care if it is just a broom closet with a camera and a feed.
[01:25:05.238 --> 01:25:06.838]  A lot of cities just have that.
[01:25:07.059 --> 01:25:09.179]  I think that's better than some of the stuff we have here.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.721]  And where you can go and it's purely to soapbox and purely talk to the people.
[01:25:14.562 --> 01:25:17.483]  And I know they've been trying to shut it down down in Houston.
[01:25:17.523 --> 01:25:18.023]  What's going on?
[01:25:18.877 --> 01:25:28.143]  Well, unfortunately, Pat Darlinghouse resigned her position as the executive director, and that essentially happened because she's been under constant assault.
[01:25:28.183 --> 01:25:29.684]  She's been defamed and defrauded.
[01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:36.248]  And in reality, she never did anything wrong other than stand up to the city council and say that she wasn't going to exercise prior restraint.
[01:25:36.268 --> 01:25:40.590]  You've got one city councilwoman who wants to shut it down, so where is it going?
[01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:42.351]  Well, the contract's going to get passed.
[01:25:42.451 --> 01:25:48.114]  They've loaded the new contract with all kinds of prior restraint clauses, and we've already contacted ACLU.
[01:25:48.134 --> 01:25:50.595]  But they were going to shut it down just six months ago.
[01:25:50.956 --> 01:25:54.357]  Well, yes, but see... So the point is that you won the battle.
[01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:57.639]  You may still lose the war, but right now you're still on the fight.
[01:25:57.839 --> 01:26:06.543]  Well, yeah, the mayor's kind of used this as a smokescreen, and whether he's a change agent or not, I don't really know, but he's used this... Of course the Houston mayor is a globalist.
[01:26:06.763 --> 01:26:22.511]  Yeah, he stacked the board with literally his campaign manager and other cronies, and now under the guise of doing the station as cultural arts, they're instituting all kinds of procedures that are going to disenfranchise the general producer and shift the purpose of the station towards
[01:26:23.135 --> 01:26:24.016]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:26:24.036 --> 01:26:33.080]  In lieu of just completely killing them, they just turn them into crony programs to air local campaign commercials and city arts programs.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:43.085]  Well, a caveat as well as to what you were talking about about Rick Perry, the same kind of legislation that got drafted here, this was the test market, and that same legislation has been drafted by McCain.
[01:26:43.777 --> 01:26:48.179]  And another gentleman who are both, you know, you can go and look up their campaign finance on OpenSecret.
[01:26:48.339 --> 01:26:51.300]  No, nationwide, they're going after everything.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.781]  Community radio, even licensed co-op radio.
[01:26:54.802 --> 01:26:55.742]  They're trying to shut it down.
[01:26:55.822 --> 01:26:56.802]  University radio.
[01:26:57.122 --> 01:27:02.465]  They're trying to restrict everything where you can get anything that isn't totally controlled as being shut down.
[01:27:02.705 --> 01:27:03.525]  Well, it's not going to work.
[01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:04.165]  It's too late.
[01:27:04.205 --> 01:27:04.866]  It's out of the box.
[01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:05.506]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:05.966 --> 01:27:06.906]  I appreciate it, Mark.
[01:27:07.467 --> 01:27:08.487]  Brenda in Florida.
[01:27:08.527 --> 01:27:09.187]  Go ahead, Brenda.
[01:27:10.428 --> 01:27:10.588]  Hi.
[01:27:11.212 --> 01:27:11.532]  Welcome.
[01:27:11.872 --> 01:27:12.392]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:12.813 --> 01:27:20.155]  I just want to call and let people know that they need to get on their phone right now and call the House floor.
[01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:22.216]  I've just asked for the U.S.
[01:27:22.296 --> 01:27:24.957]  Attorney General's resignation.
[01:27:25.718 --> 01:27:26.578]  Retreat and sedition.
[01:27:27.259 --> 01:27:30.522]  Well, it's good that you asked, but I wouldn't expect him to run and do that immediately.
[01:27:31.062 --> 01:27:36.807]  Now, you know, they're trying to reauthorize the Patriot Act this week, and we're fighting that.
[01:27:36.867 --> 01:27:40.109]  But our Christian president says it's just a GD piece of paper.
[01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:40.810]  Yeah, I know.
[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:44.993]  And the thing is, he committed treason and sedition when he said that he didn't want anybody to fight this.
[01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.176]  And people need to get on their phones to their reps.
[01:27:48.316 --> 01:27:50.658]  I just asked the House floor to bring charges.
[01:27:52.019 --> 01:27:55.602]  And anyway, people need to get up there and really start fighting like you do.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.701]  I mean, you're a blessing for everybody.
[01:27:58.021 --> 01:27:58.722]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[01:27:58.762 --> 01:28:00.663]  Listen, I'm just doing my job, Brenda.
[01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:01.304]  I mean that.
[01:28:01.824 --> 01:28:04.907]  Well, you're doing a wonderful job, and I'm so proud of you.
[01:28:04.927 --> 01:28:07.909]  As a matter of fact, I know a gentleman here that I talk with.
[01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.271]  He sounds just like you on the phone.
[01:28:10.771 --> 01:28:13.353]  I was going to this meeting, and he was there.
[01:28:13.573 --> 01:28:18.397]  Anyway, he's a fighter like you are, too, and he sounds just like you when he talks.
[01:28:18.897 --> 01:28:19.537]  Well, that's good.
[01:28:19.557 --> 01:28:20.558]  He must be a good old boy.
[01:28:20.718 --> 01:28:21.879]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.101]  This is a life-and-death fight.
[01:28:25.393 --> 01:28:27.975]  The elite wants to totally enslave and control us.
[01:28:28.975 --> 01:28:30.236]  And this is no quarter.
[01:28:32.637 --> 01:28:34.819]  No quarter given, no quarter taken.
[01:28:35.259 --> 01:28:36.620]  This is full bore, 110%.
[01:28:38.081 --> 01:28:40.262]  For all the marbles, it is not a drill.
[01:28:40.302 --> 01:28:42.283]  We'll be right back with the news and your calls.
[01:28:43.804 --> 01:28:44.724]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.185 --> 01:28:46.806]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.726 --> 01:28:50.388]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.519 --> 01:28:54.781]  Would you like to own a computer?
[01:28:55.021 --> 01:28:57.644]  Would you like to upgrade to a newer, more up-to-date computer?

[01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:55.413]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.553 --> 01:29:59.655]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:02.677]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:09.440]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.642]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.842 --> 01:30:15.243]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.383 --> 01:30:25.509]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:26.470]  M-T-B-E.
[01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:27.510]  Radon-222.
[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:29.592]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[01:30:29.732 --> 01:30:30.572]  Even nitrates.
[01:30:30.852 --> 01:30:34.855]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:30:35.015 --> 01:30:42.600]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:42.920]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.982]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:53.379 --> 01:31:02.046]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or one in three adults?
[01:31:02.386 --> 01:31:06.670]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:11.433]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:31:11.774 --> 01:31:16.818]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:31:17.218 --> 01:31:21.001]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like joint care,
[01:31:21.261 --> 01:31:21.541]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:57.294]  We don't need no education.
[01:31:57.435 --> 01:32:04.379]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:04.459 --> 01:32:08.621]  No dark sarcasms in the classroom.
[01:32:38.941 --> 01:32:40.301]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:40.342 --> 01:32:41.622]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:32:42.103 --> 01:32:43.964]  We wage war on corruption.
[01:32:44.004 --> 01:32:46.606]  We crash the lives and disinformation.
[01:32:47.746 --> 01:32:48.187]  Every day...
[01:32:49.011 --> 01:32:50.051]  I see articles like this.
[01:32:50.111 --> 01:32:51.912]  Police raiding houses looking for drugs.
[01:32:51.932 --> 01:32:52.832]  No drugs found.
[01:32:52.852 --> 01:32:55.292]  They stomp out broken glass on the ground.
[01:32:56.053 --> 01:33:00.293]  Articles where in Dallas somebody walks across the street with their son when there's no traffic.
[01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:05.395]  They call it jaywalking because the light wasn't white for walk.
[01:33:06.975 --> 01:33:11.396]  Articles where a 42-year-old businessman, no criminal record, the machine's broken.
[01:33:11.716 --> 01:33:14.837]  He sells somebody a token to get on the New York subway at cost.
[01:33:15.257 --> 01:33:16.557]  The cops come and arrest him.
[01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:22.297]  And they're making all these new little rules and enforcing them, throwing the book at people.
[01:33:23.938 --> 01:33:26.299]  Old ladies being arrested for the most petty of reasons.
[01:33:26.999 --> 01:33:28.399]  And then you see an article like this.
[01:33:28.419 --> 01:33:32.201]  This is from the Pilot Online, the Virginian pilot.
[01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:36.373]  Fingerprint Scan lets Norfolk students check out books.
[01:33:36.954 --> 01:33:44.920]  Michelle Wright, 9, a fourth grader from Chesterfield Academy, gets her fingerprint digitized so she can check out books on the school's library.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:54.809]  The system, which she uses earlier this month, came online this fall and relies on biometrics to identify the students and let them check out books without carrying a library card.
[01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:58.352]  And then you read the different industry publications.
[01:33:59.398 --> 01:34:01.780]  And they brag that it's federal grants.
[01:34:02.001 --> 01:34:02.842]  Federal money.
[01:34:02.862 --> 01:34:07.026]  They take your tax money, my tax money, and pay to put cameras.
[01:34:07.905 --> 01:34:11.846]  Biometrics, ID cards around their necks, literal prisoner behavior.
[01:34:12.326 --> 01:34:22.869]  This is going to go in nationwide, and Neil Bortz and all the fake fair tax people are going to sell us on a national sales tax, but it's going to be integrated with the income tax.
[01:34:22.889 --> 01:34:31.232]  They're going to simply cut the income tax, but keep it there for Social Security, for FICA, at around 10% on average, and then they'll jack it up later.
[01:34:31.252 --> 01:34:32.152]  This is the official plan.
[01:34:33.945 --> 01:34:36.186]  And I just hear them pushing it so hard.
[01:34:36.226 --> 01:34:39.287]  They're saying Bush may mention it now in his State of the Union.
[01:34:39.868 --> 01:34:41.008]  A fair tax.
[01:34:41.028 --> 01:34:51.172]  But see, we can't have the poor people paying a sales tax, so they'll have to swipe their card to prove that they're in a zero sales tax bracket.
[01:34:52.633 --> 01:34:57.195]  And then it's going to be graduated from 10% up to 30% depending on how much money you make.
[01:34:57.455 --> 01:35:00.016]  Oh, but there's going to be a whole new black market.
[01:35:01.471 --> 01:35:07.416]  Of people swiping their cards who are at a 0% and then backdoor selling it to other people.
[01:35:08.196 --> 01:35:08.777]  Fencing it.
[01:35:09.137 --> 01:35:10.178]  The feds already say this.
[01:35:10.258 --> 01:35:15.502]  So, the way they're going to deal with it and the industry that's going to implement it is going to deal with it is RFID and all the new cards.
[01:35:15.862 --> 01:35:16.503]  Already happening.
[01:35:17.043 --> 01:35:23.548]  And they're going to make you thumbprint to prove your identity and to stop identity fraud while they've all told us how bad it is.
[01:35:23.568 --> 01:35:26.150]  And this will be our new system!
[01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:29.353]  And people like Neil Bortz know it.
[01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:38.781]  They know it, but they sit up there and pose as conservative libertarians, fooling you, laughing all the way to the bank.
[01:35:39.822 --> 01:35:44.504]  And for ten years I've known about the sales tax scam, and for ten years I've warned you.
[01:35:48.394 --> 01:35:51.757]  We're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:35:51.777 --> 01:35:52.637]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:35:52.657 --> 01:35:52.717]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:52.777 --> 01:35:56.120]  And we will get to all the people that are patiently holding at that point in time.
[01:36:07.407 --> 01:36:10.448]  Right now, let me just go through some more of the news.
[01:36:11.048 --> 01:36:14.789]  I wrote this little headline together with Ryan Slickheisen this morning, this little comment.
[01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:19.810]  President Bush is known for being extremely profane, but that isn't the story.
[01:36:22.091 --> 01:36:25.792]  After Capitol Hill Blue released a story about Bush's outbursts referring to the U.S.
[01:36:25.832 --> 01:36:26.992]  Constitution as a G.D.
[01:36:27.973 --> 01:36:28.673]  piece of paper...
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:30.960]  I think.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:31.701]  I think.
[01:36:54.913 --> 01:37:06.601]  Each story Capitol Hill Blue has published about Bush's cursing, tantrums, violent outbursts, which came from anonymous sources, have been later corroborated by mainstream news outlets such as the New York Daily News.
[01:37:07.361 --> 01:37:16.387]  The supplemental spin on the story is to redirect the outrage away from the context of Bush's statement to President's language itself.
[01:37:16.932 --> 01:37:17.072]  I think?
[01:37:27.418 --> 01:37:38.264]  But the reality and the really damaging element of Bush's tantrum is that he reveals that he is aware that he is destroying everything printed on the quote, piece of paper.
[01:37:38.304 --> 01:37:40.025]  It's really a piece of parchment.
[01:37:40.445 --> 01:37:45.848]  The neocons must not have their way and spin this seven ways to Sunday.
[01:37:46.188 --> 01:37:48.569]  We must remind people what makes...
[01:37:50.575 --> 01:38:12.410]  And what's at stake here in not whether or not we have a profane president, although we know we do, but what we have as an immature man-child at the figurative helm of the nation who is knowingly crushing our civil liberties to enhance his power and the power of his masters.
[01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:17.033]  And I would just add that it's really not even our civil liberties, it's our God-given rights.
[01:38:17.754 --> 01:38:17.934]  So...
[01:38:19.739 --> 01:38:21.120]  Sorry for babbling through that.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.543]  But to boil that down, instead of everyone discussing, oh, everybody says GED, that's what I'm hearing on the radio now.
[01:38:27.903 --> 01:38:28.963]  It isn't even about that.
[01:38:29.284 --> 01:38:30.384]  And everybody doesn't say that.
[01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:33.085]  It's that he's saying it about the Constitution.
[01:38:33.305 --> 01:38:34.826]  He's saying it's just a piece of paper.
[01:38:36.167 --> 01:38:46.231]  But again, neocon worshippers, they still think they're for the Constitution, so they're going to psychologically avert their mind from that and focus in on the GED and say it's no big deal.
[01:38:47.435 --> 01:38:47.695]  No, no, no.
[01:38:47.735 --> 01:38:51.938]  It's not just the GD by itself, which is a big deal, in meetings behaving like that.
[01:38:51.978 --> 01:38:52.838]  It's very unprofessional.
[01:38:52.858 --> 01:38:57.080]  I mean, I expect the exterminator when he comes to my house to not talk like that.
[01:38:58.341 --> 01:39:02.563]  But that is a side issue compared to that he's saying it about the Constitution.
[01:39:03.564 --> 01:39:04.484]  So face it.
[01:39:04.884 --> 01:39:05.985]  Look at it in the eye.
[01:39:06.225 --> 01:39:08.126]  He's saying it about America.
[01:39:08.406 --> 01:39:13.429]  That's what makes America America is the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, our willingness to defend it.
[01:39:13.989 --> 01:39:15.430]  That's what created the milk and honey.
[01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:16.731]  That's what made us prosperous.
[01:39:19.995 --> 01:39:23.336]  All right, let me now get into some other important news today.
[01:39:23.716 --> 01:39:29.098]  Diebold's CEO resigns after reports of fraud, litigation, and internal woes.
[01:39:29.518 --> 01:39:30.639]  This is out of the Raw story.
[01:39:30.679 --> 01:39:40.162]  The chief executive officer of electronic voting company Diebold, who once famously declared that he would deliver Ohio for President Bush, has resigned, effective immediately.
[01:39:40.182 --> 01:39:45.844]  The board of directors and Wally mutually agreed that his decision...
[01:39:47.037 --> 01:39:51.500]  To resign at this time for personal reasons was in the best interest of all parties.
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:40:01.826]  Odell's resignation comes just days after reports that the Brad blog, that the company was facing imminent securities fraud litigation surrounding charges of insider trading.
[01:40:02.186 --> 01:40:08.770]  It also comes on the heels of Ross Story's interview with a die-bold insider who raised new allegations of technical woes.
[01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:09.811]  They're not woes.
[01:40:10.311 --> 01:40:12.973]  If I shoot somebody in the head on purpose, it was premeditated.
[01:40:13.293 --> 01:40:14.274]  It wasn't a screw-up.
[01:40:14.714 --> 01:40:19.157]  I mean, they have convicted computer felons working there running elections.
[01:40:19.778 --> 01:40:24.841]  Inside the company, we've had other insiders go public and say that it's all written to run scams.
[01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:25.422]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:26.903 --> 01:40:37.510]  Interview with a Diebold insider who raised new allegations of technical woes inside the company, as well as concerns that Diebold may have mishandled elections in Georgia and Ohio.
[01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:38.891]  Mishandled elections.
[01:40:39.358 --> 01:40:39.638]  Hmm.
[01:40:40.419 --> 01:40:44.662]  Again, if somebody kidnaps your daughter and kills her, it won't be a mishandling.
[01:40:44.722 --> 01:40:45.683]  It was done on purpose.
[01:40:46.243 --> 01:40:51.668]  Diebold's chief operating officer, Thomas Swidkarski, will take Odell's place.
[01:40:52.528 --> 01:40:55.090]  This has been a very challenging year for the company, he said.
[01:40:55.110 --> 01:41:08.401]  We are beginning to make progress to improve some of the performance issues, reduce our cost structure by addressing insufficiencies in our manufacturing supply chain and software development processes, and install price discipline throughout the company.
[01:41:09.569 --> 01:41:10.009]  We're good to go.
[01:41:10.049 --> 01:41:10.189]  I think?
[01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:39.636]  Their main crime is openly writing the software with backdoors in it, which are then accessed during the elections by their computer felons.
[01:41:40.377 --> 01:41:46.262]  Computer crimes hacker felons that they gobble up and hire left and right who run the elections at state levels.
[01:41:47.094 --> 01:41:48.296]  None of us are supposed to question that.
[01:41:48.356 --> 01:41:49.678]  Oh, look, it's built with back doors.
[01:41:49.698 --> 01:41:54.844]  Oh, look, you've got all these CIA connections with most of your top people being former CIA deputy directors.
[01:41:55.445 --> 01:41:58.389]  But the top three companies all have... Two of them have former directors.
[01:41:58.829 --> 01:42:00.952]  One of them has the former head of the NSA running them.
[01:42:01.213 --> 01:42:03.415]  I mean, how much more obvious does this get?
[01:42:03.455 --> 01:42:03.556]  You...
[01:42:04.116 --> 01:42:14.483]  We've talked to voter-right activists that have gone to these places, like guys with short haircuts, rock-ready stances, and white, stark shirts, all Special Forces military, guarding them.
[01:42:14.783 --> 01:42:16.765]  Guys with machine guns walking the perimeter.
[01:42:17.085 --> 01:42:19.687]  Because it's all a big joke, and no one's allowed to look under the hood.
[01:42:19.707 --> 01:42:22.068]  No one's allowed to look at the proprietary software.
[01:42:22.288 --> 01:42:23.069]  Just trust them.
[01:42:23.089 --> 01:42:25.290]  It doesn't matter if polls are going against them.
[01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:27.252]  It doesn't matter if their candidates are in trouble.
[01:42:27.732 --> 01:42:30.634]  It's like Senator Hagel owns his own voting machine company.
[01:42:34.456 --> 01:42:39.401]  It's patently ridiculous.
[01:42:43.084 --> 01:42:44.966]  Interesting article here out of the Guardian.
[01:42:45.026 --> 01:42:47.248]  Two countries, one booming, one struggling.
[01:42:47.288 --> 01:42:48.910]  Which one followed the free trade route?
[01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:53.674]  A look at Vietnam and Mexico exposes the myth of market liberalization.
[01:42:54.474 --> 01:42:54.994]  We're good to go.
[01:43:22.708 --> 01:43:26.089]  General Motors bankruptcy said possible.
[01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:30.291]  Reuters, a bankruptcy by General Motors Corporation is not far-fetched.
[01:43:30.311 --> 01:43:41.015]  It presents trends that the company's Standard & Poor's said on Monday shortly after cutting GM's ratings deeper into junk territory.
[01:43:43.296 --> 01:43:46.878]  Again, a bankruptcy by General Motors Corporation is not far-fetched.
[01:43:46.938 --> 01:43:50.159]  It presents trends that the company's persisted.
[01:43:51.152 --> 01:43:57.138]  Standard & Poor's said on Monday shortly after cutting GM's ratings deeply into junk territory.
[01:43:57.558 --> 01:44:14.035]  The downgrade at Standard & Poor's comments initially sent GM shares and bonds lower as investors fretted about the rising risk that the world's largest automaker will have trouble paying back all of its debt.
[01:44:14.668 --> 01:44:25.571]  In the past, we might have felt at different points that the concerns about bankruptcy risk were being overplayed, said Scott Sprinson, speaking on a conference call with reporters and analysts.
[01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:35.594]  At this juncture, it is our conclusion that this isn't as far-fetched a possibility if the kind of deterioration in results we've seen over the past few quarters should continue.
[01:44:36.337 --> 01:44:39.099]  So if it continues for another six months, another year, it's over.
[01:44:39.499 --> 01:44:46.103]  GM spokesman Gina Priota said the automaker has no strategy or intention to declare bankruptcy.
[01:44:46.443 --> 01:44:54.407]  GM has an aggressive and well-thought-out strategy to turn around our North American business, and we're making progress in some important areas, she said.
[01:44:56.869 --> 01:45:04.493]  Folks, this is what they do with the S&P, what they do with the Dow Jones, what they do with the NASDAQ.
[01:45:06.605 --> 01:45:16.713]  When a company stops performing well, they simply take it out of the major indexes, the major sources we go for indices.
[01:45:19.095 --> 01:45:21.137]  And here's just an example of the thousands.
[01:45:22.258 --> 01:45:26.441]  When someone goes off the unemployment rolls, they are counted as employed.
[01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.022]  We're good to go.
[01:45:58.163 --> 01:46:10.245]  And you go, wait a minute, but you look at the actual graft, the whole year's been dismal, but of course a few people got part-time, short-term jobs because it is the holidays, because there is an upswing in business right now.
[01:46:10.906 --> 01:46:14.806]  But employment isn't up, say, in the last four or five years.
[01:46:15.146 --> 01:46:22.988]  They just used a smaller graft to say, oh, look, it went up a little bit now that we're going into the Christmas holiday, even though those sales are sluggish at best.
[01:46:24.913 --> 01:46:26.534]  There are so many other examples of this.
[01:46:27.255 --> 01:46:36.240]  But when a stock drops, they take it out of the basket of stocks that are in the NASDAQ, that are in the Dow Jones.
[01:46:38.321 --> 01:46:45.866]  And when they take your stock out of that, then yes, then they go, oh look, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, why...
[01:46:47.202 --> 01:46:49.882]  It's going to get back up close to $11,000 again.
[01:46:50.323 --> 01:47:04.065]  Well, yeah, if they only stick the good-performing, bloated $400-a-share Googles in there and the Microsofts in there, then of course you're going to be able to say the stock market's doing good.
[01:47:05.405 --> 01:47:08.206]  Look, here's an even simpler example.
[01:47:08.226 --> 01:47:15.887]  I know most of you are more economically minded than I am, but here's an example for a public school-educated neocon or liberal listening right now.
[01:47:17.404 --> 01:47:18.425]  Remember two years ago?
[01:47:18.445 --> 01:47:19.665]  It really happened.
[01:47:19.725 --> 01:47:29.750]  They put all fast food, whether it's fried chicken or cheeseburgers, in as value-added manufactured goods.
[01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:36.533]  And that actually, then Bush would go out and announce that, hey, this month our manufacturing went up by 11.5%.
[01:47:36.693 --> 01:47:38.574]  I'll never forget those numbers.
[01:47:39.094 --> 01:47:41.335]  And it was hailed as, look, 11.5% increase.
[01:47:41.355 --> 01:47:42.596]  Then people looked at it and said, wait a minute.
[01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:49.333]  We actually would have had a substantive decrease this month if it wasn't for adding all fast food.
[01:47:50.413 --> 01:47:54.216]  And by the way, all fast food, folks, even counted things like cafeterias.
[01:47:54.276 --> 01:48:00.039]  So they took a large portion of all restaurants in the country and added that as manufacturing.
[01:48:00.079 --> 01:48:06.543]  And folks, if you think cheeseburgers are going to stack up against the Chinese now announcing they're going to manufacture cars...
[01:48:08.072 --> 01:48:09.473]  Now, what really gives you a job?
[01:48:10.834 --> 01:48:13.695]  A $6, $7 an hour, if you're lucky, cheeseburger flipping job?
[01:48:14.395 --> 01:48:17.577]  Or a $20 an hour job working for GM?
[01:48:18.498 --> 01:48:19.378]  Which isn't going to be there.
[01:48:19.538 --> 01:48:21.099]  Especially once the Chinese go online.
[01:48:21.759 --> 01:48:23.080]  And all the big investments going there.
[01:48:24.141 --> 01:48:25.822]  Now, please, again, explain that to me.
[01:48:26.862 --> 01:48:29.083]  Neocons got on the air and defended it.
[01:48:29.404 --> 01:48:29.764]  I heard them.
[01:48:29.864 --> 01:48:33.626]  Oh, well, you know, this is manufacturing.
[01:48:33.966 --> 01:48:35.487]  They do manufacture things.
[01:48:35.987 --> 01:48:37.368]  They are making meals.
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.061]  Folks, that is not a manufacturing job.
[01:48:41.661 --> 01:48:52.186]  A manufacturing job is equated with machinery that is used in the economy, that is used in other factories, or it is considered the manufacturing of durable goods.
[01:48:52.646 --> 01:49:01.930]  Durable goods are belts and shirts and computers and TV monitors and cameras and video games.
[01:49:03.715 --> 01:49:12.081]  And can openers and butcher knives, they are not cheeseburgers or chicken fried steaks or enchiladas or frijoles.
[01:49:13.362 --> 01:49:20.927]  They are not the guy putting a hot dog together for you in downtown Manhattan with some relish on top and some sauerkraut.
[01:49:21.208 --> 01:49:22.208]  That is not a Boeing 747.
[01:49:22.609 --> 01:49:23.890]  It's not a Boeing 777.
[01:49:24.970 --> 01:49:26.031]  That's all moved to China.
[01:49:26.732 --> 01:49:27.172]  Most of it.
[01:49:29.193 --> 01:49:30.034]  But doesn't that matter?
[01:49:30.054 --> 01:49:34.318]  They'll just tell you that it's a... Yeah, this cheeseburger is a Chevy Tahoe.
[01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:35.238]  Okay.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:40.683]  All right, I've got about 50 other articles.
[01:49:40.743 --> 01:49:44.206]  No exaggeration here, but I'm just going to throw these out at Morgan Reynolds when he gets on with us.
[01:49:44.727 --> 01:49:48.410]  We're going to take some more of your calls when we get back on the other side before we get our guest on.
[01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:50.872]  So be sure to stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:50.892 --> 01:49:51.312]  Check it out.
[01:49:54.648 --> 01:49:57.490]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.751 --> 01:49:59.332]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.672 --> 01:50:04.376]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.696 --> 01:50:09.120]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:13.743]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.964 --> 01:50:16.806]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.906 --> 01:50:19.368]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:50:19.568 --> 01:50:26.154]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.394 --> 01:50:33.621]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.861 --> 01:50:36.283]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.443 --> 01:50:38.185]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.561]  We're good to go.
[01:51:15.642 --> 01:51:22.146]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.306 --> 01:51:27.410]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:36.396]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:40.179]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:03.688 --> 01:52:10.030]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:11.050]  I think so too.
[01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:26.339]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.494 --> 01:52:56.954]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.455 --> 01:52:58.995]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.495 --> 01:53:02.237]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.657 --> 01:53:07.299]  I fell into a... How many others are coming up?
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:20.826]  Morgan Reynolds, the head of the Department of Labor, chief economist there, the head of their economic policy, number two position there for the current bushing.
[01:53:21.226 --> 01:53:22.987]  He was in the Bush administration, left...
[01:53:24.809 --> 01:53:30.092]  And has been exposing Lord Bush for the criminal that he is.
[01:53:30.172 --> 01:53:32.193]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:32.793 --> 01:53:38.656]  And yes, we're going to get to Nathaniel and Michael and Bill and Tony and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:53:38.676 --> 01:53:41.517]  There's also a little story here that's very serious.
[01:53:41.877 --> 01:53:44.038]  Group warns Bill contains national ID.
[01:53:44.518 --> 01:53:47.940]  Immigration measures, employment provisions dangerous.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.982]  Well, yeah, Bush's plan for immigration is to legalize all of them.
[01:53:53.243 --> 01:53:53.703]  We're good to go.
[01:53:53.723 --> 01:53:53.903]  I think?
[01:54:13.232 --> 01:54:18.418]  And instead of giving somebody a gift that they're not going to use, give them the gift of information.
[01:54:18.879 --> 01:54:24.885]  Give them my new film, The Order of Death, exposing the Illuminati's activities at Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:24.905 --> 01:54:28.769]  New footage inside the owl where they do the sacrifice, the mock sacrifice.
[01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:31.893]  New footage of the effigies, footage inside the buildings.
[01:54:32.393 --> 01:54:33.274]  Three films in one.
[01:54:33.374 --> 01:54:34.174]  Three films in one.
[01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:09.474]  We're talking about the police state, then what happened on 9-11, how they carried it out, why they carried it out, and then who the Globalist are, what their master plan is, what their ideology is.
[01:55:09.995 --> 01:55:26.309]  Three hours long, one DVD, one VHS, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, a bunch of other books and videos by other great authors and researchers, Tex Mars, Codex Magica, the coming battle about the Federal Reserve System,
[01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:32.933]  Pro Second Amendment t-shirts, anti-New World Order t-shirts for as low as $9.95 apiece.

[01:56:03.716 --> 01:56:06.257]  Nathaniel in Texas, welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:56:07.118 --> 01:56:08.119]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:56:08.259 --> 01:56:08.579]  Good, sir.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:12.162]  Um, Alex, I don't even know where to start, man.
[01:56:12.462 --> 01:56:12.542]  Um...
[01:56:13.542 --> 01:56:17.243]  I've got a letter here that I wrote, if I could read some of this.
[01:56:17.443 --> 01:56:20.885]  It kind of just surmises what's been going on with me.
[01:56:21.825 --> 01:56:27.767]  To whom it may concern, I know this sounds all too fantastic to believe, and I'm sure most people will doubtless think me a total lunatic.
[01:56:28.227 --> 01:56:30.828]  I have no pretensions of being a great man or anything along those lines.
[01:56:31.368 --> 01:56:34.069]  I do not know exactly if any or all of this is truth or fiction.
[01:56:34.089 --> 01:56:40.912]  I do know, however, something compelled me to start reading Revelations late one night, and at that time I was not a regular reader of the Holy Bible.
[01:56:42.301 --> 01:56:53.389]  In Revelations, there are repeated references to both Saddam, which is spelled Sodom, and then not put in parentheses Saddam, the way you spell Saddam Hussein, as well as Babylon, where modern-day Iraq is.
[01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:57.512]  The Tigris and Euphrates rivers also are in modern-day Iraq.
[01:56:58.253 --> 01:57:01.916]  You may have even heard of Iraq's cradle of modern civilization, perhaps.
[01:57:01.956 --> 01:57:05.158]  There are some scientists, biblical scholars... I'm going to hold you over.
[01:57:05.178 --> 01:57:09.021]  We've got a guest coming up, so you can crystallize what you're trying to get at.
[01:57:09.779 --> 01:57:10.820]  That would be really good.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.521]  We've got a break.
[01:57:12.402 --> 01:57:18.668]  The clock waits for no person, for no man, and we've got to start the third hour.
[01:57:18.768 --> 01:57:22.451]  Morgan Reynolds is coming up, and I'd like to be able to let you finish up and get to another caller.
[01:57:22.491 --> 01:57:27.236]  So before we get Mr. Reynolds on, we'll also have open phones with Mr. Reynolds on with us.
[01:57:27.796 --> 01:57:29.458]  He'll be able to talk on any issue you wish.
[01:57:29.498 --> 01:57:31.119]  He's a very intelligent man.
[01:57:31.139 --> 01:57:31.580]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.354 --> 01:57:38.478]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.978 --> 01:57:40.620]  Hello, folks!
[01:57:49.747 --> 01:57:50.447]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.047 --> 01:57:52.188]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.829 --> 01:57:53.950]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:55.371]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.144 --> 01:57:57.025]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.045 --> 01:58:01.649]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.889 --> 01:58:06.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.233 --> 01:58:10.736]  Well, there's talk of the General Motors going bankrupt.
[01:58:10.796 --> 01:58:15.600]  The dollar tumbled even further, losing some gains it made over the last few months.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:20.624]  And by gains, that is modest gains on its 45% loss.
[01:58:20.684 --> 01:58:21.965]  It had gained a few points back.
[01:58:23.331 --> 01:58:30.794]  And the globalists are running around cheering and loving what they're doing to this country, meanwhile brainwashing the public with their propaganda TV shows and media.
[01:58:31.755 --> 01:58:42.299]  And so we'll bring this up with the former chief economist for the Department of Labor for George W. Bush, Morgan Reynolds, in the next segment about a bunch of other news too we're going to throw out there.
[01:58:42.719 --> 01:58:46.360]  We were just talking to a caller in Texas, Nathaniel.
[01:58:46.381 --> 01:58:52.283]  He said he'd never really read the Bible or didn't frequently read it, I believe he said, but he was drawn to read Revelations and
[01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:55.872]  And he was seeing parallels and seeing Saddam in there and all this.
[01:58:55.892 --> 01:58:59.294]  So I was going to let him finish up the point he was starting to make.
[01:58:59.334 --> 01:58:59.714]  Go ahead.
[01:59:00.755 --> 01:59:05.718]  Well, I had a real strange occurrence, I guess, to cut all the other stuff out.
[01:59:05.778 --> 01:59:08.040]  I know you don't have time for a real long, drawn-out call.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:14.184]  I was working as a temp for a company named Tyrex that did subcontracting work for Dell.
[01:59:15.184 --> 01:59:21.028]  And we were on an assembly line taking apart computer chassis and taking out gaskets and testing fans and putting them back in.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:27.222]  There was a strange guy there that said, you know, yeah, my preacher says my tattoos are the mark of the beast.
[01:59:27.282 --> 01:59:30.803]  And I said, well, no, I think it's got something to do with technology.
[01:59:31.643 --> 01:59:34.624]  And you could have heard a pin drop, and I got laid off from that job.
[01:59:35.144 --> 01:59:36.925]  But then they had a job for me out at Dell.
[01:59:37.705 --> 01:59:44.787]  And I was working with these strange people that were out there, and they were talking about witchcraft and all this, and Donald Rumsfeld and how they'd met him.
[01:59:44.827 --> 01:59:50.989]  And this one guy was talking about, yeah, he had a chance to work out at Area 51 and this and that.
[01:59:51.536 --> 02:00:01.581]  You know, he got into the whole alien thing and Planet X and all this, and did I know what the pyramids were about and all this, but then he just looked straight at me and he said, our God is going to rise straight up out of the sea.
[02:00:02.102 --> 02:00:03.822]  There's not a damn thing you can do about it.
[02:00:04.983 --> 02:00:10.846]  So you were over there, and let me guess, you didn't worship Satan with them, so you were fired.
[02:00:10.866 --> 02:00:16.589]  No, I was praying to my God while they were praying to their God, and I never went back to that job.
[02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:18.370]  I told them I found another job after that.
[02:00:18.888 --> 02:00:24.872]  But the weird thing was, he wanted to know where I had heard about some of this stuff was, and I said something about AXS TV.
[02:00:25.693 --> 02:00:41.363]  Ten years ago, I used to be in Austin, and I'd seen some of your programming, and it was like a few years after that that I noticed Dell had been involved in trying to shut down AXS TV, and I just wondered if there was any connection between that.
[02:00:41.803 --> 02:00:44.105]  Where did you see where they were involved in trying to shut it down?
[02:00:45.606 --> 02:00:46.446]  I thought I'd heard that...
[02:00:47.509 --> 02:00:48.330]  From your program.
[02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:53.673]  Maybe I heard from somebody else that they were part of the move to try to... Well, yeah, no, they were offering money.
[02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:56.295]  You're a close listener.
[02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:58.516]  Yes, they were offering money to the very board.
[02:00:58.536 --> 02:01:03.360]  I also had some wacky security guards follow me around, and I kind of felt uneasy.
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:07.062]  Let me tell you, Dell... They were getting ready to jump me or something.
[02:01:07.122 --> 02:01:09.524]  Dell is like an IBM wannabe.
[02:01:10.716 --> 02:01:11.657]  Very creepy.
[02:01:12.677 --> 02:01:15.739]  I actually had an employee go buy me some monitors.
[02:01:15.879 --> 02:01:18.400]  I said, just buy the cheapest, oldest monitors.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.581]  He brought Dells in here.
[02:01:19.601 --> 02:01:22.522]  I think I'm going to throw them in the trash and just buy new ones.
[02:01:22.562 --> 02:01:26.044]  I don't even want Dell monitors in my office.
[02:01:26.784 --> 02:01:32.007]  If you change the D to an H, you know what you wind up with.
[02:01:32.107 --> 02:01:38.370]  Strangely enough, I had a Dell computer that was a used one that had been given to me by a third party.
[02:01:39.048 --> 02:01:45.411]  And the thing logged itself back onto the Internet, and somebody was accessing my hard drive, and I got rid of that thing after that.
[02:01:45.471 --> 02:01:48.433]  Well, I just know Dell fires people that visit my website.
[02:01:48.533 --> 02:01:52.375]  Again, they're allowed to visit websites at lunch, but if you visit my site, you're fired.
[02:01:52.835 --> 02:01:57.438]  And they'll call them right in and go, we logged you on InfoWars, get your stuff, and get out of here.
[02:01:58.178 --> 02:02:01.160]  And Michael Dell is a real piece of work.
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.200]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[02:02:02.761 --> 02:02:03.421]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:07.303]  We're going to get Morgan Reynolds on here after the quick break.
[02:02:08.468 --> 02:02:10.450]  And, you know, you can't win for losing.
[02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.973]  I mean, you try to buy a Sony VAIO, they're New World Order.
[02:02:14.013 --> 02:02:16.254]  You try to buy an HP, they're total New World Order.
[02:02:16.795 --> 02:02:18.396]  IBMs are total New World Order.
[02:02:20.958 --> 02:02:23.721]  I've got two G5s for video editing.
[02:02:23.761 --> 02:02:26.183]  I mean, they're pretty New World Order.
[02:02:27.263 --> 02:02:28.605]  It's just you've got to choose, though.
[02:02:28.645 --> 02:02:31.207]  I mean, it doesn't get any worse than IBM.
[02:02:31.247 --> 02:02:32.227]  I mean, they're just pure evil.
[02:02:34.309 --> 02:02:35.090]  If something's evil...
[02:02:36.033 --> 02:02:36.834]  They're involved in it.
[02:02:36.854 --> 02:02:38.255]  100% of the time.
[02:02:38.395 --> 02:02:40.896]  And we can do whole shows on it.
[02:02:40.977 --> 02:02:43.038]  In fact, my film, Martial Law, covers IBM.
[02:02:43.058 --> 02:02:44.339]  We spend some time on them.
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:47.861]  What really happened September 11th?
[02:02:48.021 --> 02:02:49.182]  And who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.823 --> 02:02:51.124]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.324 --> 02:02:57.048]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[02:03:42.294 --> 02:03:44.356]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:45.706 --> 02:03:46.306]  Hello, folks.
[02:03:46.406 --> 02:03:47.326]  Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.446 --> 02:03:51.568]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.688 --> 02:03:54.548]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.648 --> 02:04:01.370]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:04.551]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.751 --> 02:04:07.132]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.272 --> 02:04:11.993]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[02:04:12.193 --> 02:04:12.673]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.433 --> 02:04:37.814]  803-4438.
[02:04:37.874 --> 02:04:40.395]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.535 --> 02:04:43.536]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:45.257 --> 02:04:47.238]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:04:47.278 --> 02:04:50.179]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:04:50.359 --> 02:04:55.761]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:04:55.982 --> 02:04:57.502]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:04:57.542 --> 02:04:59.803]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:04:59.963 --> 02:05:03.485]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:05:03.505 --> 02:05:03.605]  And?
[02:05:03.885 --> 02:05:04.525]  We're good to go.
[02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:27.251]  We're good to go.
[02:05:49.807 --> 02:05:50.467]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.128 --> 02:05:52.228]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.888 --> 02:05:53.989]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:55.470]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.210 --> 02:05:57.090]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.791 --> 02:06:01.752]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.972 --> 02:06:06.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.274 --> 02:06:16.779]  If memory serves me correctly, and it normally does, we were the first to interview...
[02:06:17.913 --> 02:06:36.779]  Morgan Reynolds, after he had written some articles for Lou Rockwell and others, and had been picked up by several major national publications, and former Bush government member says something else may have brought down towers, and government may have been involved.
[02:06:37.359 --> 02:06:42.581]  We were the first to have him on the radio, and I'm just so honored to have him back on with us again.
[02:06:43.530 --> 02:06:44.991]  And, of course, he's Morgan Reynolds.
[02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:50.416]  Back in 2001 and 2002, he was the chief economist of the Department of Labor.
[02:06:50.476 --> 02:06:52.558]  That's the number two position there.
[02:06:52.598 --> 02:06:57.102]  We've also, of course, had the chief economist, the number two position, Deputy...
[02:06:58.577 --> 02:07:09.580]  Secretary of the Treasury on many times, Paul Craig Roberts, who's gone from saying they could have been involved to they probably were involved, that is, criminal elements of the government, on 9-11.
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:14.802]  Ron Paul says the government may declare martial laws for arresting us and take our guns.
[02:07:14.882 --> 02:07:17.843]  Bob Barr said the government may set up a dictatorship.
[02:07:17.903 --> 02:07:21.064]  It looks like that may happen, and that Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[02:07:21.804 --> 02:07:25.565]  Of course, Morgan Reynolds is a, what you'd call, conservative-slash-libertarian.
[02:07:26.349 --> 02:07:26.790]  We're good to go.
[02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.990]  I think?
[02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:53.701]  UL National Laboratory underwriters going, we tested it, this building couldn't have fallen from fire.
[02:07:53.781 --> 02:07:54.402]  Impossible.
[02:07:54.902 --> 02:07:56.865]  We have all these people going public.
[02:07:56.905 --> 02:08:01.110]  So I don't want to hear that, oh, if some criminal element did this, they'd get caught.
[02:08:01.531 --> 02:08:03.073]  Well, yeah, they've now been caught 44 times.
[02:08:03.693 --> 02:08:13.862]  Plus years later, 41 years later, that the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, our government attacked them, they didn't fire back, and they called that an attack, and 58,000 Americans died.
[02:08:13.882 --> 02:08:19.967]  It is now admitted, I've interviewed the admirals that took the phone call, that LBJ got on the phone and said, I want that GD ship going to the bottom.
[02:08:20.267 --> 02:08:22.349]  They had Israel attack it, tried to blame it on Egypt.
[02:08:23.163 --> 02:08:24.523]  They strafed the lifeboats.
[02:08:24.724 --> 02:08:27.384]  I mean, this is... Northwoods is real.
[02:08:27.484 --> 02:08:29.225]  Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[02:08:29.265 --> 02:08:31.866]  government plan to carry out 9-11-style attacks.
[02:08:32.366 --> 02:08:35.227]  So I don't want to hear that, oh, if this was true, it would come out.
[02:08:35.627 --> 02:08:42.389]  We had the dean of the defense language school say that he was forced to train Muhammad Atta and others, and that they were government agents.
[02:08:43.089 --> 02:08:46.470]  And then they threatened to court-martial him, and he shut up real quick, but they dropped the court-martial.
[02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:48.331]  You know, we forget all of this.
[02:08:48.411 --> 02:08:52.272]  The colonel, the defense language school chief, we're trying to get back on.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:53.920]  Now retired.
[02:08:55.421 --> 02:08:59.181]  Again, Muhammad Adan and others being trained at his base out in Monterey, California.
[02:08:59.541 --> 02:09:01.222]  Trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:09:01.542 --> 02:09:02.762]  We know what happened.
[02:09:02.782 --> 02:09:03.602]  Do you understand?
[02:09:03.622 --> 02:09:05.623]  All right, I've been ranting for two minutes.
[02:09:05.683 --> 02:09:08.023]  I appreciate Morgan Reynolds joining us.
[02:09:08.503 --> 02:09:10.404]  Morgan, it's a real honor to have you back on.
[02:09:10.604 --> 02:09:12.104]  It's good to be back on, Alex.
[02:09:12.904 --> 02:09:15.005]  Any comments on the rant I just threw out there?
[02:09:17.171 --> 02:09:17.591]  Amen.
[02:09:21.212 --> 02:09:31.054]  When I went down to Florida last week with this series of Jimmy Walter programs, I actually did a PowerPoint on false flag terrorism.
[02:09:31.614 --> 02:09:39.496]  You just start with Nero burning down half of Rome to pin it on the Christians, right up to 9-11 and beyond.
[02:09:39.516 --> 02:09:40.896]  Now we've got 9-11s around the world.
[02:09:46.994 --> 02:09:48.135]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:09:48.155 --> 02:09:49.796]  I mean, they're constantly happening.
[02:09:49.856 --> 02:09:52.198]  I mean, clearly the Madrid bombing was an op.
[02:09:53.178 --> 02:09:55.560]  Clearly, Gladio declassified U.S.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.341]  government ops.
[02:09:56.781 --> 02:09:58.482]  Clearly, 7-7 was an op.
[02:09:58.542 --> 02:09:59.463]  It just goes on and on.
[02:10:00.464 --> 02:10:00.884]  It does.
[02:10:01.864 --> 02:10:06.588]  The great thing about the Madrid bombing was the unpredicted reaction.
[02:10:07.228 --> 02:10:13.633]  And that is, people said, no, let's get these guys out of the government and put in the new ones.
[02:10:13.873 --> 02:10:13.953]  And
[02:10:15.323 --> 02:10:16.223]  Get out of Iraq.
[02:10:17.064 --> 02:10:19.726]  That gives the perpetrators pause.
[02:10:19.926 --> 02:10:28.973]  Well, actually, nationwide they reported, you're right, in Reuters that two million people took to the streets and hundreds of signs were seen saying the government did it within a day of it happening.
[02:10:30.177 --> 02:10:45.370]  I'm still reserving judgment two weeks after the 7-7 bombing, saying I don't know if it's the government, and mainstream news articles are saying it probably is, and of course the evidence later conclusively showed that, but my point is that I'm getting now to kind of be the one that's not radical.
[02:10:45.651 --> 02:10:48.113]  People are getting it so fast now, Mr. Reynolds.
[02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:50.275]  Or should I say Dr. Reynolds?
[02:10:51.616 --> 02:10:55.139]  Alex, that's the heartening thing, is that truthfully,
[02:10:55.479 --> 02:10:57.020]  The truth does not retreat.
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:11:02.064]  I don't care how much disinformation is put out, false leads and the like.
[02:11:02.525 --> 02:11:07.088]  Every advance we make is just stout.
[02:11:07.188 --> 02:11:19.098]  I was heartened to find how many Americans know about this just because of the emails I got and the response to radio programs like yours.
[02:11:20.646 --> 02:11:21.047]  Callers.
[02:11:21.307 --> 02:11:22.808]  Well, sir, I want to get into 9-11.
[02:11:22.828 --> 02:11:26.652]  I want to take calls today in the next 47 minutes we've got left with you.
[02:11:26.872 --> 02:11:34.840]  But I was asking you during the break when we first got you on, I can't wait until you write a book or put out a video because I want to carry it in my bookstore.
[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:37.162]  But I said, is there anything you want to promote or plug?
[02:11:37.182 --> 02:11:41.506]  And you said there's a particular website you like that you're a member of, and I hardly agree with you.
[02:11:42.007 --> 02:11:44.069]  Tell folks about the 911 Physics site.
[02:11:44.489 --> 02:11:47.231]  Yeah, that's physics911.org.
[02:11:47.491 --> 02:11:54.695]  We've got a lot of good material there about why the official 9-11 story is physically impossible.
[02:11:55.396 --> 02:11:59.018]  And over the next few weeks, we're going to be adding some other good stuff.
[02:11:59.898 --> 02:12:01.600]  We've added some new people.
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.120]  You mentioned Underwriter Labs.
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:06.082]  Kevin Ryan's come on board, Stephen Jones.
[02:12:06.783 --> 02:12:12.226]  And there's an aeronautical engineer and former airline pilot who's
[02:12:12.585 --> 02:12:20.451]  I'm going to describe how it was physically impossible because of the air pressure for a Boeing 757 to go into the Pentagon.
[02:12:20.791 --> 02:12:27.416]  Now, we already know it's proven impossible, the government story at the Pentagon, but this just adds more.
[02:12:27.436 --> 02:12:39.486]  In other words, there's so much air pressure under a plane that's supposedly going this fast, this low, it would have blown open those trailers, those construction trailers out there on a Pentagon lawn, etc.,
[02:12:40.461 --> 02:12:41.802]  Just physically impossible.
[02:12:41.922 --> 02:12:42.602]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:12:42.662 --> 02:12:48.606]  A plane cannot land a plane that size at 600 miles an hour like the government was saying.
[02:12:48.806 --> 02:12:59.713]  They have to slow down to 150 or so, even slower, put their end down, and direct the flaps just so, and then it's still hard to put one down.
[02:12:59.993 --> 02:13:00.594]  Right, right.
[02:13:01.174 --> 02:13:07.278]  So it's just a mess of pottage the government has sold us, that is, the perpetrators themselves.
[02:13:08.687 --> 02:13:09.587]  Well, absolutely.
[02:13:09.847 --> 02:13:12.628]  You're an economist, got a doctorate in it.
[02:13:13.068 --> 02:13:17.789]  Why don't you get into your views on GM?
[02:13:17.809 --> 02:13:19.449]  They're now talking about going bankrupt.
[02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:23.310]  We have the dollar tumbling even more, gold exploding.
[02:13:24.230 --> 02:13:28.370]  How they play games with the stock markets by taking losers out of the indexes.
[02:13:28.951 --> 02:13:37.172]  I mean, give us your take on, well, Bush has spent more money than all other presidents combined, and that's hailed as conservative.
[02:13:38.138 --> 02:13:43.441]  Right, and the rate of growth in spending is more rapid than LBJ's Great Society.
[02:13:43.922 --> 02:13:51.306]  Just pure recklessness of the First Order on every front.
[02:13:51.446 --> 02:13:57.230]  There's a couple points about gold and silver and the greenback losing altitude.
[02:13:57.870 --> 02:14:01.673]  One is we've got Ben Bernanke coming into the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:02.613 --> 02:14:06.976]  It doesn't have near the false prestige, though it is, that Greenspan doesn't.
[02:14:07.415 --> 02:14:21.913]  Among economists, he's known as Helicopter Ben because of his statements about how a deflation is impossible because we can just print as much as we want and distribute it via helicopter, just drop it from the air.
[02:14:22.515 --> 02:14:24.917]  So the markets are getting the message here.
[02:14:25.257 --> 02:14:39.229]  And so if they've already put out, what, $3.5, almost $4 trillion in the last five years, which is, I mean, Germany printing levels before the Depression, then with Bernanke, exactly, he said he's going to heat the presses up even more.
[02:14:39.289 --> 02:14:39.969]  What should we see?
[02:14:41.530 --> 02:14:52.099]  Well, that's what the markets are saying, is get into things that the Fed can't print, like oil and precious metals.
[02:14:52.975 --> 02:15:06.742]  And then Monday, I guess, the Chinese central bank or some government spokesperson said over there that, well, maybe we've got enough of these greenbacks now, right?
[02:15:06.762 --> 02:15:07.982]  They've got about a billion.
[02:15:08.983 --> 02:15:15.506]  So that means maybe the party's over on financing our foreign trade deficit.
[02:15:15.967 --> 02:15:17.408]  So there's another straw in the wind.
[02:15:17.448 --> 02:15:22.490]  The world is gagging on printed paper money that says U.S.
[02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:23.190]  dollar on it.
[02:15:23.210 --> 02:15:28.692]  Well, they already went to a basket six months ago, which would be devastating in and of itself.
[02:15:28.712 --> 02:15:29.573]  But you're right, sir.
[02:15:29.593 --> 02:15:31.754]  They're talking about moving out of the dollar.
[02:15:31.974 --> 02:15:33.114]  This is unbelievable.
[02:15:33.695 --> 02:15:34.175]  Well, yeah.
[02:15:34.195 --> 02:15:38.557]  Remember Saddam said, I think I'll take euros now for Iraqi oil?
[02:15:39.077 --> 02:15:40.317]  He's invaded next week.
[02:15:42.174 --> 02:15:51.657]  Once the dollar begins to be shirked as the world reserve currency, we can't print our way into buying all these imported goods and services.
[02:15:51.997 --> 02:15:52.897]  Sir, you're an economist.
[02:15:52.917 --> 02:15:58.699]  You headed up the Labor Department's entire economic strategy for the current president in the first two years.
[02:15:59.219 --> 02:16:01.781]  Well, it certainly raises the price of their BMWs over the long run, right?
[02:16:29.087 --> 02:16:29.227]  I think.
[02:16:29.247 --> 02:16:32.709]  Foreign goods are going to become more expensive with a cheaper dollar.
[02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:39.973]  The whole world currency system is so messed up.
[02:16:40.053 --> 02:16:46.176]  You have all these floating paper monies and dirty floats by intervention by the central bank.
[02:16:46.536 --> 02:16:52.039]  It is just a mess compared to a century ago when we were still on a gold standard.
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:55.961]  Where do you see it going then?
[02:16:56.001 --> 02:17:00.405]  I mean, do you see the dollar falling, the bottom falling out?
[02:17:00.425 --> 02:17:01.966]  How low would it go if that's the case?
[02:17:02.307 --> 02:17:05.029]  Well, it very well can.
[02:17:06.570 --> 02:17:08.592]  Calling this is a hard thing to do.
[02:17:08.652 --> 02:17:12.415]  I'd be a rich man if I could call 9 out of 10 of these things.
[02:17:13.316 --> 02:17:20.562]  But this may be... The dollar was even lower against the euro a while back.
[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:27.023]  A euro was, what was it, $1.35, and right now it's $1.20.
[02:17:27.203 --> 02:17:30.925]  So we have a ways to go in the dollar losing value.
[02:17:30.945 --> 02:17:36.188]  So you see this being kind of a long, not going out with a bang, but with a whimper.
[02:17:36.568 --> 02:17:37.929]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:17:37.989 --> 02:17:40.510]  I'll bet against the dollar long run, absolutely.
[02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:41.791]  Okay, please stay there, sir.
[02:17:41.811 --> 02:17:42.371]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.675 --> 02:17:46.256]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.296 --> 02:17:46.656]  I think?
[02:18:11.756 --> 02:18:14.698]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:18:46.005 --> 02:18:56.737]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:18:56.917 --> 02:19:04.485]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:04.705 --> 02:19:05.206]  Thank you.
[02:19:05.226 --> 02:19:05.526]  Thank you.
[02:19:20.686 --> 02:19:24.567]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:19:24.627 --> 02:19:26.528]  The water level is always visible.
[02:19:26.708 --> 02:19:32.650]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:48.961]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:20:49.521 --> 02:20:50.822]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:51.262 --> 02:20:53.964]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:54.424 --> 02:20:57.066]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:57.506 --> 02:21:03.950]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:21:04.310 --> 02:21:07.474]  Get your stickers at LibertyStickers.com for your family, friends, and community.
[02:21:24.799 --> 02:21:26.240]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:26.780]  Have you?
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:28.841]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:21:29.301 --> 02:21:33.102]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:21:34.223 --> 02:21:37.064]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:21:37.504 --> 02:21:38.565]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:21:39.125 --> 02:21:40.305]  Osama been forgotten.
[02:21:40.745 --> 02:21:44.387]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:21:55.866 --> 02:21:56.788]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:21:56.828 --> 02:22:01.998]  Talking to Morgan Reynolds, Chief Economist, Department of Labor in Bush's first administration, 2001-2002.
[02:22:04.972 --> 02:22:07.194]  I want to get a little bit more into the economics.
[02:22:07.554 --> 02:22:11.658]  The strategic elites, why are they saying that a weak dollar is good?
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:15.782]  Bush has been saying, we don't care if the dollar goes down.
[02:22:16.623 --> 02:22:20.366]  You were even in his administration when he first started saying that back in 2002.
[02:22:20.846 --> 02:22:30.075]  I remember him going on TV in snow, Treasury Secretary going on TV and saying that when he got in in 2003, saying it's not a bad thing.
[02:22:30.775 --> 02:22:32.796]  Who cares if we're the world reserve currency?
[02:22:33.096 --> 02:22:35.277]  I mean, everybody knows that would be devastating.
[02:22:36.037 --> 02:22:39.899]  Then people wouldn't want all our funny money, and that's really our only product we've got left.
[02:22:40.219 --> 02:22:41.059]  Comments on that, sir?
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:46.762]  Yeah, I'm not sure what their motive is.
[02:22:47.522 --> 02:22:49.783]  A lot of it is sheer ignorance.
[02:22:51.404 --> 02:22:55.926]  If you have a cheaper dollar, it does help our exports.
[02:22:57.286 --> 02:22:58.947]  That means farm, industrial...
[02:22:59.522 --> 02:23:01.964]  But our balance of trade is so out of kilter.
[02:23:01.984 --> 02:23:10.010]  I mean, if we have more exports than imports, sure, short-term, it might not be bad to have a weak currency.
[02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:14.674]  Yeah, it does tend to rebalance it or close up the deficit, but it takes a heck of a long time, too.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:26.700]  I don't know.
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:31.382]  It's almost like these people have quit on all these issues.
[02:23:31.442 --> 02:23:36.443]  It's just a snow job, Mr. Secretary of the Treasury.
[02:23:36.463 --> 02:23:37.364]  Yeah, pun intended.
[02:23:37.964 --> 02:23:42.825]  Yes, and you just have to say, where are these guys coming from?
[02:23:43.166 --> 02:23:44.446]  What advice are they getting?
[02:23:45.186 --> 02:23:50.348]  My experience was, one reason I wanted to leave, certainly after one year, was,
[02:23:51.549 --> 02:23:57.874]  They don't listen to what is good, sound economic analysis and advice.
[02:23:57.974 --> 02:23:58.775]  They don't care.
[02:23:58.795 --> 02:24:01.096]  It's all about short-run spin.
[02:24:04.158 --> 02:24:05.219]  Can you give us an example?
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:12.344]  Well, how about the unemployment numbers and employment stats that come out every month?
[02:24:12.465 --> 02:24:15.747]  I had to prep the Secretary of Labor, prepare her.
[02:24:15.767 --> 02:24:18.529]  Here's the good points, here's the bad points.
[02:24:19.210 --> 02:24:26.834]  And she would never concede a thing when the press would ask her a question that was kind of semi-hostile.
[02:24:26.854 --> 02:24:29.016]  Well, there's some things wrong over here.
[02:24:30.036 --> 02:24:32.758]  Manufacturing jobs are down 80,000 again.
[02:24:33.338 --> 02:24:36.620]  Well, and she would just use that as a pretext for it.
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:43.924]  And that's why we've got to pass the President's legislation on Capitol Hill, whatever was in fashion at that time.
[02:24:43.944 --> 02:24:48.127]  What about the famous thing of a few years ago saying that fast food jobs would be
[02:24:48.866 --> 02:24:51.228]  Would be durable goods from manufacturing.
[02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:54.810]  It would be durable goods?
[02:24:55.671 --> 02:24:58.113]  Yes, they were saying that this counted as manufacturing.
[02:25:00.635 --> 02:25:02.957]  Yeah, they're saying this with a straight face.
[02:25:03.037 --> 02:25:04.217]  Yeah, very amusing.
[02:25:06.239 --> 02:25:10.502]  Well, Carl Rose told the New York Times that they, quote, control reality.
[02:25:10.522 --> 02:25:14.305]  You're saying, being in that administration, you think they believe their own propaganda?
[02:25:16.556 --> 02:25:23.524]  My experience at labor was that I would tell them, hey, this is going to catch up with you.
[02:25:24.225 --> 02:25:25.707]  They would just poo-poo that.
[02:25:26.047 --> 02:25:27.750]  People don't remember anything.
[02:25:28.390 --> 02:25:30.533]  Well, it's catching up to them now, isn't it?
[02:25:31.955 --> 02:25:35.059]  One lie after the other, small, medium, and large.
[02:25:35.672 --> 02:25:36.973]  Where do you see Iraq going?
[02:25:36.993 --> 02:25:40.175]  Do you think they really thought they could go over there and fix everything?
[02:25:40.215 --> 02:25:45.979]  Or do you think that they wanted things to be screwed up because they could sell more weapons systems the longer they were there?
[02:25:46.599 --> 02:25:48.521]  I think there's a mix of motives.
[02:25:48.641 --> 02:25:51.943]  Some people believe the one and others believe the other.
[02:25:51.963 --> 02:25:54.425]  It's almost like 9-11.
[02:25:54.565 --> 02:25:57.687]  You've got all these people compartmentalized.
[02:25:58.476 --> 02:26:07.038]  And you probably use foreign labor to plant the demo explosives in the three towers because that's going to be so huge.
[02:26:08.258 --> 02:26:14.539]  But you can use Americans and these ordinary type number of deaths.
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:19.820]  Oh yeah, a lot of people would actually be supporting the attack and think they were part of a drill.
[02:26:20.781 --> 02:26:21.901]  That happens too.
[02:26:21.921 --> 02:26:23.021]  That's right.
[02:26:23.061 --> 02:26:24.101]  You're being used.
[02:26:24.141 --> 02:26:26.542]  You turn out to be a form of a stooge.
[02:26:26.582 --> 02:26:26.762]  You're
[02:26:29.069 --> 02:26:32.512]  A kind of an unconsenting participant.
[02:26:33.652 --> 02:26:34.893]  Well, it's like the hijackers.
[02:26:34.993 --> 02:26:36.374]  Clearly government agents.
[02:26:36.514 --> 02:26:42.699]  Clearly highly trained as spies at Monterey in California and at Pensacola and other places.
[02:26:43.139 --> 02:26:49.584]  Then they go out and create a ledger, a history, and then they're on those planes, but that's as far as it goes, the little decoys.
[02:26:50.618 --> 02:26:52.539]  Well, yeah, that's just the cover-up story.
[02:26:52.879 --> 02:26:53.479]  The patty.
[02:26:53.879 --> 02:26:56.240]  But we even have the evidence that that's what happened.
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:58.821]  That's the only thing it conclusively shows.
[02:27:00.141 --> 02:27:02.522]  In fact, I want to ask Morgan Reynolds this when we get back.
[02:27:02.542 --> 02:27:04.143]  We're about to break at a long segment coming up.
[02:27:04.163 --> 02:27:05.083]  We'll take some of your calls.
[02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:12.846]  Looking at the evidence, we know the official story is a fraud, but what do you think really happened from all the evidence you've got?
[02:27:13.602 --> 02:27:17.843]  Specifically, now, you know, we know the bad guy committed the murder.
[02:27:17.883 --> 02:27:20.924]  We caught him red-handed, but we're now having to reconstruct the crime.
[02:27:20.964 --> 02:27:26.326]  I want to see what your opinion is on this from your research that you've done.
[02:27:26.386 --> 02:27:27.866]  Morgan Reynolds on the other side.
[02:27:28.746 --> 02:27:30.867]  And we'll take your calls as well.
[02:27:30.887 --> 02:27:32.927]  800-259-9231.
[02:27:35.848 --> 02:27:36.808]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.849]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.869 --> 02:27:42.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.968 --> 02:27:48.330]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.570 --> 02:27:52.414]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:27:52.754 --> 02:27:53.555]  Read the labels.
[02:27:53.975 --> 02:27:58.119]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.339 --> 02:28:02.522]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.883 --> 02:28:07.767]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:08.147 --> 02:28:11.729]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:11.909 --> 02:28:17.251]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.531 --> 02:28:20.252]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.552 --> 02:28:21.452]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:29:45.823 --> 02:29:52.687]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:29:52.827 --> 02:30:05.773]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:30:05.933 --> 02:30:07.474]  Are you sick of barely having money?

[02:30:50.465 --> 02:31:02.292]  I've got a few more questions for our guest, Morgan Reynolds, and then we're going to open the phones up to Michael Bill, Chris Rorsch, and a few others.
[02:31:02.852 --> 02:31:05.454]  And I have a couple news articles I want to mention to him.
[02:31:06.294 --> 02:31:08.575]  One of those, well, we'll get to that in a second.
[02:31:08.915 --> 02:31:14.979]  My last question before we hit that break, Dr. Reynolds, was the point...
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:18.561]  We know there are official stories of fraud.
[02:31:18.701 --> 02:31:19.982]  We know it's an inside job.
[02:31:20.002 --> 02:31:21.303]  We know there were bombs in the buildings.
[02:31:21.763 --> 02:31:22.803]  I mean, that's totally proven.
[02:31:22.823 --> 02:31:24.144]  Now we have the firefighter tapes.
[02:31:25.144 --> 02:31:27.425]  Even David Ray Griffin now says it's inclusive.
[02:31:27.465 --> 02:31:28.486]  It was an inside job.
[02:31:28.766 --> 02:31:30.447]  He wouldn't even say that until a few months ago.
[02:31:30.987 --> 02:31:32.988]  But now it's just open and shut.
[02:31:33.868 --> 02:31:36.850]  How specifically do you think they carried out the operation?
[02:31:36.890 --> 02:31:39.871]  And who specifically do you think inside the government did it?
[02:31:41.818 --> 02:31:46.159]  Yeah, that's at the level of the professional killers and technicians.
[02:31:47.159 --> 02:31:47.879]  I don't know.
[02:31:47.899 --> 02:31:51.780]  But you can go right down the line, right?
[02:31:51.880 --> 02:32:02.143]  It's Bush, Cheney, and besides, in a conspiracy, of course, all the co-conspirators are guilty of the most grave of the crimes, meaning first-degree murder.
[02:32:02.883 --> 02:32:10.225]  But you go right down the line, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, etc., and then you get to the level, kind of the Dove, Zach Heim,
[02:32:11.744 --> 02:32:12.024]  Yes, right.
[02:32:12.044 --> 02:32:12.885]  The airlines did.
[02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:36.651]  And then you go to the FBI.
[02:32:37.771 --> 02:32:39.232]  How about the Secret Service?
[02:32:39.952 --> 02:32:44.934]  The director, Brian Stafford, that was a standout with Bush there in Sarasota.
[02:32:46.114 --> 02:32:48.115]  The Secret Service failed to do its normal job.
[02:32:48.135 --> 02:32:57.359]  And what's that weird meeting in Moffett Air Force Base where he flies up there and there's hundreds of top CEOs, including people that should have been in the towers, all meeting in some bunker secretly?
[02:32:57.399 --> 02:32:59.820]  I mean, with Warren Buffett, how weird is that?
[02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:03.421]  Right, and there are various theories about that, but...
[02:33:04.285 --> 02:33:07.186]  Yes, it all stinks to high heaven, doesn't it?
[02:33:07.526 --> 02:33:15.268]  And one thing you would do, when you are a prosecutor, you have all these marvelous coercive weapons at your disposal.
[02:33:15.608 --> 02:33:18.248]  You can just subpoena witnesses, subpoena evidence.
[02:33:18.909 --> 02:33:21.429]  And then it starts to come unwound.
[02:33:21.709 --> 02:33:25.410]  And you can offer immunity to certain people for giving it up.
[02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:27.051]  But it is coming unwound.
[02:33:27.271 --> 02:33:30.531]  This will bring down their whole New World Order.
[02:33:31.252 --> 02:33:32.892]  Why did they think they could get away with it?
[02:33:35.319 --> 02:33:36.380]  One word, hubris.
[02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:41.446]  They've been getting away with these things and they just get more and more audacious.
[02:33:41.486 --> 02:33:49.735]  When they got away with the Oklahoma City bombing, they said, hey, we could do something much bigger than this and get away with it.
[02:33:51.027 --> 02:34:07.337]  You know, I have no doubt in my mind, in my heart, in my analysis skills, Dr. Reynolds, that if we wouldn't have exposed this as boldly as we did, and if so many prominent people who've got good brains wouldn't have gone public, I have no doubt they would have already pulled something off even bigger.
[02:34:08.157 --> 02:34:09.598]  If they needed it, they would have.
[02:34:11.859 --> 02:34:19.284]  Now, in a way, because the administration is coming unstuck, they need it, but I don't know that they...
[02:34:20.696 --> 02:34:23.739]  That the reaction is going to be as predictable as the first time around.
[02:34:24.019 --> 02:34:24.499]  Exactly.
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:25.761]  They know now it's kind of a catch-22.
[02:34:25.861 --> 02:34:26.821]  It is.
[02:34:27.302 --> 02:34:32.286]  I know they were going to carry out events because they were saying, it's going to happen, nukes are going to go off, martial law is good.
[02:34:32.326 --> 02:34:33.887]  It's going to be nuclear, yes.
[02:34:34.668 --> 02:34:38.891]  If you keep investigating 9-11, the terrorists will nuke us.
[02:34:38.911 --> 02:34:40.213]  Dick Cheney said that on Facebook.
[02:34:40.233 --> 02:34:41.674]  If you pursue the truth, you're dead.
[02:34:43.999 --> 02:34:49.687]  Well, Bush came out last week and said, clearly, he said that if you don't pass the Patriot Act, terrorists will attack.
[02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:52.130]  I mean, how obvious does that have to get?
[02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:56.376]  Well, yeah, that fear card, you begin to grow numb.
[02:34:57.399 --> 02:34:58.080]  Isn't that right?
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:00.682]  It just doesn't have the same resonance.
[02:35:00.902 --> 02:35:04.125]  Well, also, people have a certain instinct, even if we're dumbed down.
[02:35:04.145 --> 02:35:08.569]  I mean, look, five years ago, I told people about government-sponsored terror.
[02:35:08.649 --> 02:35:09.570]  Most of them didn't get it.
[02:35:09.970 --> 02:35:11.451]  Three years ago, some got it.
[02:35:11.531 --> 02:35:14.594]  Now, I use the analogy of selling snow cones in hell.
[02:35:15.034 --> 02:35:17.637]  I mean, people are buying it without even having to sell it.
[02:35:17.657 --> 02:35:19.658]  I mean, they already seem to know it.
[02:35:20.719 --> 02:35:23.702]  Yes, so optimism is in order.
[02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:28.457]  Well, I first talked to you, what, six months ago when you first went public.
[02:35:28.477 --> 02:35:29.658]  You didn't have this optimism.
[02:35:29.678 --> 02:35:31.039]  You seem very optimistic.
[02:35:31.339 --> 02:35:33.341]  Dr. Reynolds, are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing?
[02:35:33.501 --> 02:35:39.365]  Well, number one, it's very satisfying to me that we are convicting them at the bar of history.
[02:35:39.605 --> 02:35:43.908]  That's not satisfying to everybody because we want real convictions.
[02:35:44.589 --> 02:35:50.853]  Let's have the gallows put up on the White House lawn after the proper trials have been held.
[02:35:51.513 --> 02:35:52.414]  Are we going to get there?
[02:35:53.284 --> 02:35:56.747]  I'm on a high in terms of I think we're going to get there.
[02:35:59.789 --> 02:36:01.631]  I tell you, I think they've really gone too far.
[02:36:01.691 --> 02:36:03.712]  But don't elites always do that throughout history?
[02:36:03.732 --> 02:36:05.934]  You talk about hubris, imperial hubris.
[02:36:05.954 --> 02:36:07.035]  They always go nuts.
[02:36:07.475 --> 02:36:08.015]  That's right.
[02:36:08.235 --> 02:36:11.278]  Yeah, they've overplayed their hand so badly.
[02:36:11.938 --> 02:36:16.962]  And the whole World Trade Center, it's just so appalling.
[02:36:17.894 --> 02:36:22.457]  I just wonder even if some of our hired killers could have planted those explosives.
[02:36:22.497 --> 02:36:26.859]  That's why we speculate, ah, foreign labor being used.
[02:36:27.820 --> 02:36:30.361]  Well, they always compartmentalize a big operation.
[02:36:30.441 --> 02:36:31.542]  Yes, right.
[02:36:32.863 --> 02:36:40.487]  And then it was just a lot of the conspirators must have been appalled at what went down that they weren't prepared for.
[02:36:40.907 --> 02:36:41.908]  How big this is.
[02:36:44.324 --> 02:36:48.385]  Well, I know Bush, just a few weeks after 9-11, got on national TV at the U.N.
[02:36:48.445 --> 02:36:51.346]  and said, how dare you say the government's involved?
[02:36:51.386 --> 02:36:53.006]  How dare you bring up these concerns?
[02:36:53.026 --> 02:36:53.506]  Oh, yes.
[02:36:53.586 --> 02:36:54.167]  Shut up.
[02:36:54.507 --> 02:36:54.767]  Right.
[02:36:55.287 --> 02:37:06.930]  On your website, I was glad to see you had the Texas A&M University statement with the former Chief Spook, President of Texas A&M, Robert M. Gates, denouncing me.
[02:37:09.449 --> 02:37:09.709]  I know.
[02:37:09.769 --> 02:37:10.930]  How obvious is that?
[02:37:11.571 --> 02:37:12.231]  Oh, man.
[02:37:12.351 --> 02:37:13.352]  Let me bring up another point.
[02:37:13.412 --> 02:37:16.575]  We know the Capitol Hill Blues reporting has really been sterling.
[02:37:16.615 --> 02:37:21.019]  I mean, I've been reading them for over ten years, and everything they've reported has been a spot on.
[02:37:21.039 --> 02:37:22.720]  They really do have moles in the White House.
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:28.525]  He was very anti-Clinton, the editor of it, and his stuff about books throwing fits.
[02:37:28.825 --> 02:37:30.787]  I mean, I have White House contacts, folks.
[02:37:30.847 --> 02:37:36.091]  I actually have two of them I really want to know, and one of them is somewhat antagonistic.
[02:37:36.111 --> 02:37:37.032]  The other is a good friend.
[02:37:37.592 --> 02:37:39.953]  That's all I'm going to say, and I've been hearing this for two years.
[02:37:40.414 --> 02:37:49.579]  Now it's in the New York Daily News that he gets 17-year-old staffers and spits and screams for 45 minutes in their face, frothing, screaming, GD, F this, F that.
[02:37:50.399 --> 02:37:59.705]  Now, in a congressional meeting that had quite a few congressmen at it, this was a big meeting there in front of all their other people, Bush said, I don't give a GD.
[02:38:00.205 --> 02:38:01.806]  I'm the president and the commander-in-chief.
[02:38:01.926 --> 02:38:02.246]  Do it.
[02:38:02.566 --> 02:38:04.227]  Stop throwing the Constitution in my face.
[02:38:04.367 --> 02:38:05.568]  It's just a GD piece of paper.
[02:38:06.048 --> 02:38:09.069]  The point is he's attacking the Constitution, not just the GED statement.
[02:38:09.809 --> 02:38:10.689]  I brought that up to you.
[02:38:10.729 --> 02:38:14.750]  What's your view on statements like that?
[02:38:14.930 --> 02:38:16.111]  Well, I believe that.
[02:38:16.151 --> 02:38:26.234]  I've seen a secretary or two just be abusive to underlings and just rant.
[02:38:26.254 --> 02:38:34.976]  I understand they're under pressure, but I just wonder if Bush, his handlers are very worried about him
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.164]  Pulling these things in public.
[02:38:38.204 --> 02:38:41.629]  That's why he can only go from military base to military base.
[02:38:41.669 --> 02:38:43.031]  He can't have any encounters
[02:38:43.496 --> 02:38:46.617]  They've got to keep them well insulated and medicated.
[02:38:47.297 --> 02:38:54.019]  You don't put somebody who can't keep their cool over a special forces fire team.
[02:38:54.359 --> 02:38:59.541]  You don't put somebody in as a bank president who blows up at people because that means they've got problems.
[02:38:59.901 --> 02:39:01.142]  I've got just a few employees.
[02:39:01.522 --> 02:39:04.163]  I never blow up and scream at them and get in their face.
[02:39:04.223 --> 02:39:08.184]  Nobody would have ever turned their family business over to George W. Bush.
[02:39:11.986 --> 02:39:14.506]  But I mean, I've wanted to scream at people, but you can't do that.
[02:39:15.927 --> 02:39:16.587]  Right.
[02:39:17.467 --> 02:39:19.767]  I just wonder if he isn't a wet drunk now.
[02:39:21.228 --> 02:39:25.849]  Well, that's the same reports we're getting from good sources, is that he's lavishing himself.
[02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:30.369]  Oh boy, I just get so sick.
[02:39:30.549 --> 02:39:36.931]  Well, I would rather... This is one reason I wanted the Bush-Cheney cabal re-elected.
[02:39:37.931 --> 02:39:38.751]  I wanted them to...
[02:39:40.026 --> 02:39:40.747]  No, I got you.
[02:39:40.767 --> 02:39:52.460]  It's like a tag team wrestling match and you want to wear out the one guy you're fighting instead of letting him win and somebody who's fresh.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:07.402]  Let's let them grind it down and leave in a disgrace.
[02:40:07.742 --> 02:40:10.883]  Well, I wrote articles like that and got Democrats really frothing at me.
[02:40:11.203 --> 02:40:14.124]  I said, they're cousins, they're skull and bones, this thing is staged.
[02:40:14.405 --> 02:40:15.965]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:40:16.365 --> 02:40:20.347]  I mean, now, Mr. Reynolds, look at the Clintons being called members of the family.
[02:40:20.647 --> 02:40:24.668]  Rupert Murdoch meets every week for four hours for a big meal with Hillary.
[02:40:24.928 --> 02:40:26.149]  They're positioning her.
[02:40:26.509 --> 02:40:29.570]  I mean, can you speak to the stagedness of all this?
[02:40:30.373 --> 02:40:30.853]  Yeah.
[02:40:31.333 --> 02:40:33.874]  It's a, quote, democracy, unquote.
[02:40:34.134 --> 02:40:35.315]  It's controlled.
[02:40:35.555 --> 02:40:35.835]  Right.
[02:40:37.276 --> 02:40:45.278]  Somebody like Ronald Reagan or JFK were actually outside of the elite and then had to be brought under control.
[02:40:45.819 --> 02:40:49.760]  JFK, they weren't doing it, so they killed them.
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:53.321]  You saw the talent of the invisible government at work there.
[02:40:53.902 --> 02:40:54.942]  And with Reagan...
[02:40:55.758 --> 02:40:56.941]  Oh, guess what?
[02:40:56.981 --> 02:41:04.414]  Within three months there was this assassination attempt by the son of a friendly family.
[02:41:05.114 --> 02:41:05.314]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:27.073 --> 02:41:27.713]  I don't know what to do.
[02:41:27.733 --> 02:41:28.373]  This is on record.
[02:41:28.393 --> 02:41:32.375]  The whole Capitol was all worried about rolling back the welfare state.
[02:41:32.755 --> 02:41:34.896]  Yeah, Reagan told Bush Sr.
[02:41:34.936 --> 02:41:36.956]  get the hell out of my office.
[02:41:37.516 --> 02:41:39.297]  The two hated each other in the campaign.
[02:41:39.337 --> 02:41:43.558]  And boy, after that special visit to the hospital, he behaved better, didn't he?
[02:41:43.918 --> 02:41:44.359]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:44.459 --> 02:41:45.959]  They kept him sedated the whole time.
[02:41:46.119 --> 02:41:51.481]  Yeah, there's nothing like a bullet just near your heart to quiet you down.
[02:41:54.727 --> 02:41:56.328]  Well, that's on record that Reagan did.
[02:41:56.368 --> 02:41:59.671]  I'm not here defending Reagan, folks, but compared to the Bushes, he was a little angel.
[02:42:01.733 --> 02:42:02.413]  Yeah, right.
[02:42:02.734 --> 02:42:08.498]  Well, you know, Ron Paul gave the neocon speech, Morgan, where he talked about we've been totally betrayed, they're totally taking over.
[02:42:08.799 --> 02:42:15.864]  What do you say to the little sniveling neocons, our little lapdogs fawning at Bush as he dismantles America?
[02:42:17.245 --> 02:42:22.770]  Well, Bush was a convenient tool, but they'll jump on somebody else.
[02:42:23.430 --> 02:42:35.999]  I mean, you could even imagine Bush being assassinated to martyrdom him, and they'll catch the next bus, the next train that'll move their agenda.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:39.242]  The parasites will just leap to a new host.
[02:42:39.282 --> 02:42:40.583]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:42.524 --> 02:42:51.251]  You know, a lot of people, a lot of analysts have been saying that the only thing that can save Bush in the history books, and we hope this doesn't happen, is him having something bad happen.
[02:42:52.774 --> 02:42:56.418]  Yeah, that's a bit like Abraham Lincoln, I'm afraid, unfortunately.
[02:42:56.699 --> 02:43:00.423]  Another real bad president, but that's for another day.
[02:43:01.324 --> 02:43:02.065]  It certainly is.
[02:43:02.165 --> 02:43:03.407]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:43:03.427 --> 02:43:05.589]  Let's talk to Michael in North Carolina.
[02:43:05.629 --> 02:43:06.310]  Michael, welcome.
[02:43:06.731 --> 02:43:07.932]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:08.032 --> 02:43:10.956]  I heard Dr. Reynolds a couple of days ago on Genesis.
[02:43:11.396 --> 02:43:12.217]  Welcome aboard.
[02:43:12.477 --> 02:43:12.818]  Thank you.
[02:43:13.956 --> 02:43:14.957]  I have to be real brief.
[02:43:14.977 --> 02:43:16.138]  My phone may cut out.
[02:43:17.419 --> 02:43:22.742]  I don't believe, gentlemen, that we can do anything in the court system in North Carolina.
[02:43:23.683 --> 02:43:24.803]  It's totally corrupt.
[02:43:25.304 --> 02:43:28.886]  I'd like to read you four sentences from Thursday's News and Observer.
[02:43:29.747 --> 02:43:34.870]  For five months, a man charged in Durham with drunken driving thought he had a lawyer to defend him.
[02:43:35.490 --> 02:43:42.315]  But in truth, the man's advocate was a salesman pitching a program that electronically monitors whether a person had been drinking.
[02:43:42.799 --> 02:43:53.043]  By the time the man who had spoke little English actually had a lawyer, he'd spent hundreds of dollars on the ankle bracelet called a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor.
[02:43:53.183 --> 02:43:55.384]  Let me just throw this out at you.
[02:43:55.544 --> 02:43:59.846]  They even had a CBS News piece four years ago in Austin about it, and I pointed it out before that.
[02:44:00.347 --> 02:44:08.170]  If you get arrested for no seatbelt, which they do, or if you get arrested, the famous Lago Vista case, or if you get arrested for unpaid traffic tickets...
[02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:12.273]  When they take you to jail, they say, we're not letting you out until you sign this form.
[02:44:12.733 --> 02:44:14.555]  And you admit to nine crimes.
[02:44:14.655 --> 02:44:17.257]  Drug dealing, drunk driving, beating your wife.
[02:44:18.018 --> 02:44:21.581]  And then they set on the news, you are now guilty until proven innocence.
[02:44:21.901 --> 02:44:24.223]  They call it personal recognizance bond.
[02:44:24.523 --> 02:44:26.104]  You want to comment on that, Dr. Reynolds?
[02:44:28.146 --> 02:44:30.448]  Corruption runs rampant.
[02:44:30.688 --> 02:44:36.973]  And I don't know the facts here, but I'm ready to believe right off the bat
[02:44:37.768 --> 02:44:40.451]  And public trust going, going, gone.
[02:44:41.251 --> 02:44:42.212]  Now that's a good thing.
[02:44:43.293 --> 02:44:43.834]  Yes, it is.
[02:44:44.414 --> 02:44:49.999]  I'd like Dr. Reynolds, if he could, to comment on deregulation of savings and loans by Reagan.
[02:44:50.039 --> 02:44:51.581]  See, most of the people I know believe that
[02:44:52.973 --> 02:45:01.336]  They're not from inflation and then being debased.
[02:45:01.416 --> 02:45:01.996]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:02.176 --> 02:45:02.876]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:45:02.916 --> 02:45:04.057]  That's exactly right.
[02:45:04.117 --> 02:45:07.678]  And Alex, if you would, could you please expand a little bit on...
[02:45:13.049 --> 02:45:24.033]  Well, that's a messy story about the SNLs, which is an artificial creature of regulation to begin with, and then they deregulate.
[02:45:24.433 --> 02:45:34.957]  What is the travesty, of course, is the taxpayer bailout to the tune of $300 billion and all the corruption, the Neil Bushes of Silverado SNL.
[02:45:42.297 --> 02:45:42.877]  I agree with you.
[02:45:42.918 --> 02:45:49.303]  Now, with Tripod 2, first that FEMA chief there on the ground said, yeah, we were there the night before for a drill.
[02:45:49.823 --> 02:45:57.849]  Then, ooh, that wasn't true, but then Giuliani got asked about it in the Whitewash Commission and admitted they were running a drill that night and that day.
[02:45:57.870 --> 02:45:58.290]  It was true.
[02:45:59.286 --> 02:46:11.333]  Yeah, they were conveniently right there near the site, very much like the Arlington Fire Department emergency vehicles were right nearby when the Pentagon was hit.
[02:46:12.854 --> 02:46:15.435]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Ohio.
[02:46:15.495 --> 02:46:16.236]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:46:16.736 --> 02:46:22.819]  Yes, Alex, I'll make this as short as I can, although I think you'll find this interesting.
[02:46:22.879 --> 02:46:27.522]  George Bush was also known as Bill Bush Man.
[02:46:28.989 --> 02:46:42.478]  He would get drunk and hold the man on his name tag and say that his real name was Bush and he was with the 1st and the 94th Artillery in 1967.
[02:46:44.119 --> 02:46:50.703]  It makes me wonder how many listeners were with the 1st and 94th and whether or not they remember him.
[02:46:51.103 --> 02:46:53.805]  He said that his dad was the head of the CIA
[02:46:56.016 --> 02:46:59.962]  And he would be, not run, but would be the president.
[02:47:00.342 --> 02:47:02.726]  And he wrote the speeches for the president.
[02:47:03.827 --> 02:47:08.995]  And I told him, I said, oh, he had the nickname of Snake Jones.
[02:47:10.089 --> 02:47:12.751]  And I told him... Sir, you've called before.
[02:47:12.951 --> 02:47:13.371]  Yes, I did.
[02:47:13.391 --> 02:47:18.135]  You said you were in Europe with Bush, and there's no record of Bush with the Texas Air National Guard in Europe.
[02:47:18.155 --> 02:47:19.356]  He was in Alabama.
[02:47:19.516 --> 02:47:25.900]  No, I'm sorry, Alex, but I think we've got some wrong information.
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:27.381]  Okay, well, send me some documentation.
[02:47:27.441 --> 02:47:27.922]  I'd like that.
[02:47:28.082 --> 02:47:30.103]  Well, I don't have the documentation.
[02:47:30.283 --> 02:47:32.385]  I don't tell no lies.
[02:47:33.192 --> 02:47:34.833]  Sir, I'm not saying that you're lying.
[02:47:34.893 --> 02:47:36.394]  I'm just saying thank you for the call.
[02:47:36.554 --> 02:47:37.274]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:37.754 --> 02:47:39.235]  I mean, I can only go off what I can prove.
[02:47:39.435 --> 02:47:40.236]  That's what I do.
[02:47:41.096 --> 02:47:43.517]  So, I mean, I'm not saying you're lying, sir.
[02:47:44.017 --> 02:47:47.119]  Any comments on Bush and being AWOL and all the rest of it?
[02:47:47.159 --> 02:47:47.319]  No.
[02:47:47.359 --> 02:47:53.542]  We're going to break here in a moment, but give us that website again, physics911.org?
[02:47:53.622 --> 02:47:53.742]  Yes.
[02:47:56.545 --> 02:47:59.948]  That is really exciting, all the prominent people that are starting to go public.
[02:48:00.428 --> 02:48:11.276]  When do you... I mean, as more and more people blow the whistle and go public, both inside and outside the program, I mean, what's your time frame on seeing people brought to justice then?
[02:48:13.898 --> 02:48:18.481]  Wouldn't it be great if Eliot Spitzer heard duty call?
[02:48:19.041 --> 02:48:21.363]  He's going to be the next governor of New York State.
[02:48:23.905 --> 02:48:24.365]  I don't know.
[02:48:24.585 --> 02:48:24.605]  I...
[02:48:26.384 --> 02:48:28.466]  I would take an intermediate run.
[02:48:29.006 --> 02:48:32.709]  I'd settle for the next five to ten years if we could get convictions.
[02:48:34.350 --> 02:48:37.352]  The problem is every president protects the criminal before them.
[02:48:37.432 --> 02:48:40.295]  I'm Bill Clinton protecting, or George Bush protecting Bill Clinton.
[02:48:40.595 --> 02:48:41.215]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:41.235 --> 02:48:41.556]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:49.111]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.372 --> 02:48:50.072]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.172 --> 02:48:50.953]  Alex Jones here.

[02:49:05.565 --> 02:49:08.387]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.487 --> 02:49:13.150]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.351 --> 02:49:17.734]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:17.994 --> 02:49:25.239]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:27.901]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:51:45.311 --> 02:51:47.493]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:47.513 --> 02:51:50.897]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.039 --> 02:51:57.423]  You know, we're out of time because we've got a couple of callers I promised we'd go to.
[02:51:57.863 --> 02:52:02.527]  But I wanted to play this clip for Australian TV here in America interviewing Americans.
[02:52:02.908 --> 02:52:03.869]  Who should we invade?
[02:52:03.889 --> 02:52:06.371]  You can choose three, five, six, ten or unlimited.
[02:52:06.912 --> 02:52:07.913]  Unlimited.
[02:52:07.933 --> 02:52:08.513]  We run everything.
[02:52:08.533 --> 02:52:10.395]  We should kill everybody, take over, nuke everyone.
[02:52:11.261 --> 02:52:20.408]  Dr. Reynolds, you can't underestimate, though, just the ignorant mass of people out there that, I guess, associate themselves with the power structure when they're not even part of it.
[02:52:20.428 --> 02:52:25.372]  Do you have any message to them, those that just mindlessly think that bombing innocent countries is good?
[02:52:25.392 --> 02:52:27.113]  I mean, wake up.
[02:52:27.213 --> 02:52:28.614]  It's willful ignorance.
[02:52:29.875 --> 02:52:33.377]  Citizens have burdens or duties, not just benefits.
[02:52:34.518 --> 02:52:35.699]  You know, it's unconscionable.
[02:52:35.759 --> 02:52:36.600]  We're a disgrace.
[02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:39.362]  This country is a disgrace when you've got
[02:52:40.181 --> 02:52:42.042]  People in such denial.
[02:52:42.683 --> 02:52:46.025]  Well, they also think that they're going to get something off an invasion.
[02:52:46.065 --> 02:52:49.507]  No, you're going to pay for it, so a bunch of big fat cats get it.
[02:52:50.828 --> 02:52:56.212]  Yeah, I mean, the private benefits are so small compared to the social costs, which are so enormous.
[02:52:57.312 --> 02:53:03.056]  Yeah, that's the Halliburton Bechtels of the world and your international banking buddies.
[02:53:04.357 --> 02:53:07.519]  Yeah, the immediate beneficiaries of this is just
[02:53:08.572 --> 02:53:12.594]  It's just appalling when you just see war is almost all cost.
[02:53:12.774 --> 02:53:17.736]  Well, they're also taking most of the money they make off the war, of our tax money, and not reinvesting it here.
[02:53:17.776 --> 02:53:20.317]  It's like buying something from a company out of state.
[02:53:20.357 --> 02:53:22.938]  It's all going to China and India for development.
[02:53:23.018 --> 02:53:25.820]  Well, yeah, that shows you where their patriotism is.
[02:53:26.420 --> 02:53:27.780]  So it seems they're looting.
[02:53:27.841 --> 02:53:30.202]  I mean, we look at all these indicators, the indices.
[02:53:30.402 --> 02:53:35.844]  Does it just look like we're seeing the strategic elites just say America's too far gone, loot the hell out of it?
[02:53:37.893 --> 02:53:38.353]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:53:38.373 --> 02:53:40.154]  It's not that obvious to me.
[02:53:40.194 --> 02:53:41.294]  You mentioned GM.
[02:53:41.354 --> 02:53:45.255]  Yeah, I mean, they're a highly unionized legacy manufacturer.
[02:53:45.695 --> 02:53:51.757]  It's proven that people can make money designing and producing and selling automobiles here, right?
[02:53:52.277 --> 02:53:56.638]  But you ain't carrying the UAW with you for decade after decade.
[02:53:58.879 --> 02:53:59.439]  Absolutely.
[02:53:59.459 --> 02:54:02.260]  Let's, real fast, Chris in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:02.820]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:54:04.381 --> 02:54:05.222]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:54:05.502 --> 02:54:07.783]  Hi, we're almost out of time.
[02:54:07.883 --> 02:54:25.973]  People talk about impeaching the president, and the president is sworn to uphold the Constitution and defend it, and if he is guilty of the things that you say he is guilty of, then as our Commander-in-Chief, really, impeachment, it's not harsh enough.
[02:54:26.173 --> 02:54:30.135]  I mean, he should be put on trial and executed if he has purposely...
[02:54:31.028 --> 02:54:35.692]  Well, the Congress should do its duty and impeach him.
[02:54:35.732 --> 02:54:42.317]  That just means he's indicted with a conviction, and then there'd be punishment for high crimes and treason.
[02:54:43.158 --> 02:54:44.019]  Right, right.
[02:54:44.079 --> 02:54:46.261]  Well, I don't ever want to turn Bush and Cheney into martyrs.
[02:54:46.321 --> 02:54:49.863]  I want them to be in a federal prison for the rest of their lives.
[02:54:49.903 --> 02:54:57.770]  The other thing I wanted to say was, Alex, I'm sorry that this is off-subject, but you were talking earlier about cops and just kind of having a thuggish mentality.
[02:54:58.427 --> 02:55:08.073]  I had a good friend of mine, a 25-year-old guy, no criminal record, ends church regularly, has a good job, this sort of thing.
[02:55:08.513 --> 02:55:23.742]  He was just driving through a neighborhood and apparently, and he didn't know at the time, but an off-duty cop, he did a Hollywood roll or something where he went two or three miles to a stop sign instead of coming to a complete stop.
[02:55:23.762 --> 02:55:25.543]  He had this guy and he didn't know.
[02:55:25.563 --> 02:55:26.444]  It was an unmarked car.
[02:55:27.113 --> 02:55:27.994]  We got about 30 seconds.
[02:55:28.034 --> 02:55:29.936]  My friend pulled a 9mm on the cop.
[02:55:29.976 --> 02:55:31.137]  He's got a concealed carry.
[02:55:31.637 --> 02:55:34.139]  And this guy was just acting like a complete thug.
[02:55:34.159 --> 02:55:39.024]  But once he, you know, had a gun pulled on him, he showed him his badge.
[02:55:39.064 --> 02:55:39.745]  My friend put his
[02:55:50.543 --> 02:55:50.783]  Absolutely.
[02:56:14.145 --> 02:56:14.445]  All right.
[02:56:14.485 --> 02:56:15.506]  Well, Godspeed, my friend.
[02:56:15.526 --> 02:56:16.227]  Keep up the good work.
[02:56:16.768 --> 02:56:17.428]  You too, Alex.
[02:56:17.528 --> 02:56:17.889]  Thank you.
[02:56:18.089 --> 02:56:18.509]  Take care.
[02:56:18.549 --> 02:56:20.291]  There goes Morgan Reynolds, fellow Texan.
[02:56:20.812 --> 02:56:21.993]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.053 --> 02:56:22.954]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.994 --> 02:56:23.494]  Take care.
