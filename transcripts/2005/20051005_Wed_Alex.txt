[00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.579]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.300]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:10.162]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:11.602]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:13.303]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:17.886]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:22.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.551]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:39.696]  It is Wednesday, the 5th day of October 2005.
[00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:43.140]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.148]  Masses of vital news and information that we will be covering here in the next three hours.
[00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:53.332]  And we're going to open the phones up early in this hour.
[00:00:54.369 --> 00:01:00.455]  Any issue, any news item, any piece of information you wish to discuss 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.998]  By the way, folks in England and Minnesota
[00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:27.916]  We can get to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, but we certainly can't here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.217]  We can't even get to the servers.
[00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.000]  The drugs report is down in certain areas.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.483]  A lot of websites, a lot of routes to websites aren't working.
[00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:43.307]  Really strange internet activities going on today.
[00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:48.716]  And I've seen reports the last few months of where Japan won't have internet for a day.
[00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:51.038]  China won't have it for two days.
[00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:52.479]  India won't have it for a day.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.881]  Uh, you know, half the U.S.
[00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:56.342]  won't have it for five hours.
[00:01:57.443 --> 00:02:01.966]  This shouldn't be happening, but they have not upgraded the big switching hubs.
[00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:10.793]  They've said the, quote, internet is dead, and that the Internet2 crowd with the government in collusion are not updating these systems for the increased traffic
[00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:21.074]  So it's basically like not expanding a road and then letting the road just basically fall apart as more and more traffic is added to it.
[00:02:21.154 --> 00:02:22.935]  I'm told that's a big part of this problem.
[00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:30.400]  So we are very busy tracking this as it happens as well.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.322]  So I'm sorry for those of you out there that are having trouble getting to the sites.
[00:02:34.382 --> 00:02:37.044]  Believe me, it's very frustrating here.
[00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:43.941]  I get so addicted to my own website that I actually was almost throwing fits this morning.
[00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:50.525]  I mean, I was really getting angry, and I don't normally... I get angry on air, that's about it.
[00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:55.007]  I'm not normally, you know, getting angry about stuff involved with fighting the New World Order.
[00:02:55.768 --> 00:03:04.473]  And, I mean, you know, the other day I had a computer freeze up while I was trying to finish up this new video I've made, The Order of Death.
[00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:12.279]  And it's the little 35-minute addendum that goes with the new re-edited Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.921]  And, you know, the whole computer crashed.
[00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:15.982]  Lost a bunch of work.
[00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:17.243]  Didn't even get mad.
[00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:19.765]  But can't get to my website.
[00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:22.567]  I mean, I literally, my wife's like settled down.
[00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:28.732]  I was like bawling my fist and kind of lightly, you know, bringing them down on the table.
[00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:34.317]  Like somebody who's waiting for their dinner to be brought to them, you know, with a knife and fork banging on the table.
[00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.646]  So I'm going through withdrawals right now.
[00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:39.266]  I'm trying to calm myself.
[00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:42.167]  I'm asking myself, why am I so upset by this?
[00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:45.648]  I mean, in years past, the sites went down routinely.
[00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:46.828]  They just never go down.
[00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:53.270]  And this is some Internet problem itself, and it's... Then I really feel powerless.
[00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:56.871]  You know, that's the danger of the Internet.
[00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:01.753]  It's very empowering, but it's also... It's also very disempowering.
[00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:04.331]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.772]  We'll talk about what Google's up to.
[00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.493]  We'll talk about what the NSA's up to.
[00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.054]  We'll talk about this RFID tracking grid.
[00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:13.396]  You ever think you'd hear CNN with this report?
[00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:15.557]  Bush introducing martial law?
[00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:22.500]  That's the final line here in this lengthy headline.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.162]  Bush military bird flu roll slammed.
[00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:29.743]  A call by President Bush
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:42.306]  For Congress to give him the power to use the military and law enforcement roles in the event of a bird flu pandemic has been criticized as akin to introducing martial law.
[00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.948]  I'm going to talk a lot about this today, this impending bird flu.
[00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:49.309]  Head for the hills.
[00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.590]  Give up all your rights.
[00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.912]  The bird flu is going to strike any minute.
[00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:59.934]  It's almost as deadly as Planet X and the Tooth Fairy.
[00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:09.977]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:14.982]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:15.203 --> 00:05:20.849]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:25.611]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.832 --> 00:05:32.995]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:33.796]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:37.538]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.698 --> 00:05:40.219]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:47.163]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:06:02.418 --> 00:06:11.483]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:22.949]  Black quirky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:29.012]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:35.897]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.117 --> 00:06:42.942]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.652]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:08.055]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.617 --> 00:08:14.400]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.440]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.502]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:18.463]  Folks, we're live
[00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:20.956]  5th day of October 2005.
[00:08:21.336 --> 00:08:26.279]  Let me run through some of the news we'll be covering today, and then we're going to go straight to your calls.
[00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:33.803]  Micah, Linda, Anton, Jack, and many others, toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:33.843 --> 00:08:46.071]  Bush has said that because of the flooding, because of the hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and because of the threat of terrorists,
[00:08:46.861 --> 00:09:05.147]  And because now the impending bird flu that could just kill billions, they're saying, between a hundred million and two billion, that because of all of this we really need to use the military on us in our everyday lives.
[00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:07.487]  That's what he's asking for.
[00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:12.469]  Just what they've already privately, quietly geared up to do.
[00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:14.890]  I've been to all the big training drills.
[00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.750]  I've witnessed it.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.161]  I've made three videos about it.
[00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.582]  We've talked about it forever.
[00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:32.687]  In the late 1980s, they had troops dressed up in police uniforms raiding gun dealers in Virginia, in California.
[00:09:33.508 --> 00:09:39.631]  And we have the interviews with the military people admitting it, of course, in films like The Road to Tyranny.
[00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:42.252]  So, quietly, they've gotten rid of it.
[00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:45.073]  Quietly, they've had the questionnaires.
[00:09:45.093 --> 00:09:45.794]  You can forget 29 Palms.
[00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:56.572]  Back in the mid-1990s, where they said, under PDD 25, will you fire on American citizens and confiscate guns in order to do so?
[00:09:56.672 --> 00:10:03.197]  And 24% of the Marines said, oorah, I got a brain the size of a pea.
[00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:09.482]  But 70-plus percent said, no way, Jose, 76%.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:24.507]  Well, they just took that 76% and put it in Macedonia and other parts of the world, gave them deadly vaccines, gave them horrible duty, and the little scumbags that said they would, they shot up like rockets.
[00:10:25.287 --> 00:10:35.093]  And now they're swaggering around as captains and majors and colonels and generals and General Shoemaker who barbecued all those kids at Waco.
[00:10:36.088 --> 00:10:38.389]  He's been promoted to Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:39.689]  He's swaggering about.
[00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:47.713]  Comes out declassified documents that he headed up the Pentagon's occult operations with the black magic and the rest of it.
[00:10:48.473 --> 00:10:50.214]  Yes, it's mainstream news.
[00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:52.814]  Trying to stare at goats and kill them with his mind.
[00:10:53.775 --> 00:10:56.396]  This is the type of individual that runs things now.
[00:10:57.396 --> 00:11:01.158]  They brought in the Ruskies with their white noise machines to torture the Davidians.
[00:11:01.698 --> 00:11:04.439]  That's Time Magazine, Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
[00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.272]  So we got quite a collection of really nice people.
[00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:10.393]  Really nice people.
[00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:26.484]  And whether it was in Rome with Caesar 2,000 years ago, or whether we're talking about today, what's happening with our government, anytime the government wants to use troops on the people, two words come to mind, two terms.
[00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:34.590]  Dictatorship, despotism, the big T word, also tyranny, police state,
[00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.033]  I mean, there's no other way to look at it.
[00:11:40.194 --> 00:11:45.638]  The Constitution says that you're not supposed to behave like this.
[00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:48.961]  The Bill of Rights says you're not supposed to engage in these activities.
[00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:58.528]  The federal government is to coin the money, have a navy to protect the nation, and to patrol the borders.
[00:11:58.568 --> 00:11:59.689]  Those are the three main things.
[00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:03.472]  So, the troops are supposed to be on the border, but they're not.
[00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:09.294]  Oh, they are in some places to search citizens and other people, but they're not there.
[00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:13.195]  Oh, we can't put troops on the borders to stop illegal aliens.
[00:12:15.176 --> 00:12:16.876]  We just cannot do that.
[00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:19.897]  But, we can have them in Iowa.
[00:12:20.697 --> 00:12:28.119]  I remember right after 9-11, there was the local news piece in Iowa, and it was on the internet, local TV news,
[00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:34.573]  And they said, the troops have been in the airports, but now they're going to be out on the highways searching your vehicles.
[00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:35.493]  Please comply.
[00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:43.615]  And it just showed troops on the news saying, please step over here ma'am, and they've got their guns out, and they're searching her goods.
[00:12:46.756 --> 00:12:49.837]  Now see, that's totally illegal.
[00:12:50.515 --> 00:12:54.018]  You notice Bush is saying, I want to change the law.
[00:12:54.198 --> 00:12:57.661]  Well, why do you need to change the law if you're already doing it?
[00:12:57.761 --> 00:12:59.443]  Well, it's like Patriot Act 2.
[00:12:59.503 --> 00:13:01.344]  They never passed all of Patriot Act 2.
[00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:03.066]  They passed a few pieces of it.
[00:13:03.626 --> 00:13:09.391]  But they were already implementing enemy combatants, secret arrest, operations against U.S.
[00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:09.852]  citizens.
[00:13:09.892 --> 00:13:16.698]  They were already, and the courts have admitted this, implementing Patriot Act 2 weeks after they passed Patriot Act 1.
[00:13:19.113 --> 00:13:21.494]  They openly operate outside the law.
[00:13:21.614 --> 00:13:27.715]  So, they've had military operations all over this country.
[00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:32.036]  Supposedly supporting the police.
[00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:35.197]  And they're patently illegal.
[00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:36.957]  Regular army.
[00:13:37.397 --> 00:13:41.938]  Then they try to claim, well, posse comitatus, you know, deals with the army.
[00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:44.899]  Well, the army in the law simply means
[00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:46.535]  Federal troops.
[00:13:47.096 --> 00:13:58.560]  So we can use Marines, and we can use the Coast Guard, and we can use the Navy, and we can use Space Command, Security Police, and we can use whoever we want.
[00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:01.161]  We can use private security firms.
[00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:06.724]  Downnumbering in the tens of thousands actively in this country.
[00:14:07.204 --> 00:14:09.985]  We can vest them with government federal power.
[00:14:11.361 --> 00:14:16.006]  And the scholars and the courts have said, no, that's clearly illegal.
[00:14:16.487 --> 00:14:17.207]  They don't care.
[00:14:17.508 --> 00:14:18.929]  They just continue doing it.
[00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.573]  And it has nothing to do with keeping us safe from terrorists.
[00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:29.060]  It is the tell-tale sign of a police state.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.785]  It is the tell-tale indicators of a country in massive decline.
[00:14:35.003 --> 00:14:45.891]  And then you have the backdrop, the classical backdrop of the tyrants looting the treasury, bid rigging, insider trading, giving their buddies lucrative billion dollar contracts.
[00:14:48.032 --> 00:14:53.416]  All of it on its face is felony type behavior.
[00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.378]  Just in your face.
[00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:03.023]  But no one dare challenge them because they've got us already under the state of martial law.
[00:15:04.665 --> 00:15:15.452]  The Washington Times reported about two weeks after 9-11 that we were now under the state of martial law with the orders and executive orders and PDDs activated by President Bush.
[00:15:17.793 --> 00:15:20.475]  And see, it's like saying you're in hot water.
[00:15:21.636 --> 00:15:25.278]  Well, that's really kind of depends on your perspective.
[00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:28.327]  Yeah, this country's been in hot water for a long time.
[00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:30.308]  But it was just a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:33.991]  Now they've turned the tap on, and they're not mixing any cold with it.
[00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:36.953]  They're just pouring boiling hot water into the tub.
[00:15:37.473 --> 00:15:39.795]  And the tub's already half full, and it was already hot.
[00:15:40.095 --> 00:15:44.218]  But they're pouring the hot water in, the boiling hot water, and it's starting to really get uncomfortable.
[00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:48.521]  And we're pulling our feet back, we're pushing back in the bathtub, trying to get away from it.
[00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:52.504]  It's hitting our knees, and it's burning, and we're going, ow!
[00:15:53.413 --> 00:15:54.454]  That really hurts!
[00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:55.454]  Now that's bad!
[00:15:55.514 --> 00:15:55.935]  Whoa!
[00:15:55.955 --> 00:16:07.902]  You know, national ID cards, poor psychological testing and drugging, open borders, gun control, gun confiscations, bringing all these socialist judges in, going after Judge Roy Moore.
[00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:09.062]  Hey, that's not conservative!
[00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:09.883]  Hey, stop that!
[00:16:10.523 --> 00:16:13.365]  And the water's getting higher and higher and hotter and hotter!
[00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:16.927]  And you guessed it, folks, you're like the frog!
[00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:20.209]  I mean, are you gonna jump out of the tub?
[00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.111]  Or are we just gonna sit there like a bunch of idiots and
[00:16:23.846 --> 00:16:24.506]  And take this!
[00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:30.009]  Bush military bird flu roll slammed.
[00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:31.350]  Of all places, CNN.
[00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:45.478]  A call by President George W. Bush for Congress to give him the power to use the military in law enforcement roles in the event of a bird flu pandemic has been criticized as akin to introducing martial law.
[00:16:45.918 --> 00:16:47.319]  Well, there's no akin to it.
[00:16:49.562 --> 00:16:52.745]  This ain't it's brother, this isn't it's mama, this isn't it's granddaddy.
[00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:56.288]  This is martial law, the creature, the entity.
[00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.471]  This isn't a kin, this isn't related, this is it.
[00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:07.858]  Bush said aggressive action would be needed to prevent a potentially disastrous U.S.
[00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:16.045]  outbreak of the disease that is sweeping through Asia, poultry, and which experts fear could mutate to pass between humans.
[00:17:17.935 --> 00:17:19.996]  Well, I thought it's already killed 50-something people.
[00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:25.980]  But when you really read those reports, it says, well, they may have died of the flu, or they may have died of bird flu.
[00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:32.603]  And remember, folks, tens of thousands of people die every year in this country of the flu.
[00:17:33.784 --> 00:17:35.985]  There's 298 million of us.
[00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.627]  The next census comes out, there'll probably be a lot more than that.
[00:17:38.647 --> 00:17:41.629]  We're probably about 310 million, but we don't know right now.
[00:17:42.469 --> 00:17:44.070]  It's obviously over what it was five years ago.
[00:17:46.912 --> 00:17:49.314]  So, twenty, thirty thousand really isn't that many.
[00:17:50.915 --> 00:17:53.096]  It's a huge number, but in the aggregate it's not.
[00:17:53.576 --> 00:18:02.562]  I mean, do we hear about an end of freedom, an end of society, an end of total federal dictatorship because the bird flu might get us and the Russians come out?
[00:18:03.102 --> 00:18:06.404]  The Russian government scientists known for their lying activities?
[00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:08.485]  Oh, this could kill a billion people!
[00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:09.906]  This could kill two billion people!
[00:18:10.646 --> 00:18:13.028]  Our government says it could kill a hundred million people.
[00:18:16.403 --> 00:18:23.291]  And then we talk to the scientists, we look at actually what they're saying about bird flu, and it's just fear-mongering.
[00:18:23.712 --> 00:18:26.875]  You know, every year there's going to be some new flu that's going to kill a billion people.
[00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:29.078]  Every year, better get your shot!
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.044]  Such a deadly event would raise difficult questions such as how to quarantine might be enforced, the President said.
[00:18:38.504 --> 00:18:46.749]  I'm concerned about what an avian flu outbreak could mean for the United States and the world, he told reporters during a Rose Garden news conference on Tuesday.
[00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:51.972]  That was so staged, that little reporter brings it up, Bush looks down at his notes and goes right into it.
[00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:56.775]  One option is the use of military that's able to plan and move, he said.
[00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.716]  So that's why I put it on the table.
[00:18:58.836 --> 00:19:01.558]  I think it's an important debate for Congress to have.
[00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:08.690]  The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 bans the military from participating in police-type activities on U.S.
[00:19:08.711 --> 00:19:09.071]  soil.
[00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:27.766]  But Dr. Erwin Redliner, Associate Dean of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and Director of the National Center for Disease Preparedness, told the Associated Press the President's suggestion was
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.661]  Dangerous!
[00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:39.446]  We'll come back and take some calls and get more into this article, but... Notice how, well, we gotta have troops searching you and aiming guns at you because of the terrorists.
[00:19:39.966 --> 00:19:43.848]  We gotta have it because of the... the avian flu.
[00:19:43.908 --> 00:19:46.269]  We gotta have it because of the bird flu.
[00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:47.690]  We gotta have it because of SARS.
[00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.031]  We gotta have it because of flooding.
[00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:51.492]  We just... We just gotta have troops, okay?
[00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:58.889]  And yeah, once we get rid of this law, they're going to be telling you what to do, and I can read Don, but so what?
[00:20:01.846 --> 00:20:04.789]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:07.131]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:09.493]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[00:20:09.653 --> 00:20:12.116]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[00:20:12.196 --> 00:20:15.219]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:16.640]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.305]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[00:20:22.366 --> 00:20:26.970]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease, as well as undue emotional stress.
[00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.310]  I think so.
[00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:42.308]  I think so.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.722]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[00:21:59.249 --> 00:22:04.453]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.873 --> 00:22:10.357]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.918 --> 00:22:11.418]  That's right.
[00:22:11.738 --> 00:22:14.020]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:21.506]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:29.763]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:35.045]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.686 --> 00:22:38.687]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.468 --> 00:22:45.609]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[00:23:01.983 --> 00:23:08.865]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:09.005 --> 00:23:21.929]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:22.129 --> 00:23:23.910]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?

[00:23:59.728 --> 00:24:07.554]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:10.497]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.445 --> 00:24:15.446]  We have been to the operations.
[00:24:15.486 --> 00:24:16.866]  We have been to the drills.
[00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:23.468]  We've actually been there when the Marines are running checkpoints and then all of a sudden it goes live.
[00:24:23.488 --> 00:24:40.073]  They're supposedly running a drill out on some lowly highway coming into a small town, Swansboro, North Carolina, one example, and then all of a sudden they just swing out, block the road, families pull up, they go, out of the car, thank you very much, line up right there, and the police are there assisting them.
[00:24:41.113 --> 00:24:45.116]  And, uh, just giving these young troops the training to engage the American people.
[00:24:46.097 --> 00:24:47.418]  Oh, we found something illegal!
[00:24:47.498 --> 00:24:48.599]  Officers, take them down!
[00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:51.901]  You can stand up against the wall, you have the right to remain silent.
[00:24:52.622 --> 00:24:54.263]  So, where'd you get this marijuana?
[00:24:54.903 --> 00:24:57.505]  You know, it... That's what it's all about!
[00:24:58.946 --> 00:24:59.687]  You understand, folks?
[00:24:59.847 --> 00:25:06.672]  Russia, Nazi Germany, East Germany, China... They didn't even normally have troops out at checkpoints.
[00:25:07.384 --> 00:25:11.006]  I mean, this is like EXTREME martial law.
[00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:14.208]  This is EXTREME.
[00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:16.950]  But the border stays wide open.
[00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:22.913]  And we would tell you about this, and you'd laugh, and, oh, it's not true, some of you out there.
[00:25:23.594 --> 00:25:30.778]  Well, now you've seen the gun confiscations, first chance they got, turns out the looting was maybe 5% of what they said it was.
[00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:51.034]  Turns out there may have been 20, 30 maximum actual people out with guns looting that were dangerous and thousands of police were afraid of them and thousands of troops had to cower and call off evacuations because somebody heard a gunshot and it turned out it was cops shooting at dogs and alligators.
[00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:53.939]  Oh, there was a shot in the city!
[00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:54.739]  We're calling it off!
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.300]  Man, we need martial law!
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.100]  We need troops!
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.681]  Somebody shot a gun in the city!
[00:26:01.721 --> 00:26:10.383]  Then there'd be cops shooting over the next hill, and cops would freak out and hear that, and call in SWAT teams, and the SWAT teams would creep up to the edge of the hill, and oh, it's other cops.
[00:26:12.584 --> 00:26:16.965]  I mean, there's New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, there's local news articles.
[00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:18.785]  It was all a fraud!
[00:26:19.691 --> 00:26:20.491]  All made up!
[00:26:20.551 --> 00:26:46.057]  They blocked the aid, let the city break down, jammed the police communications, cut the police communications, the police pulled out, then the people started throwing fits, there were some problems at the Superdome, and then they swoop in and for three days sit there, we've now learned, I've talked to folks that have been there, we've had a monitor's guest, and the troops just sat there for three days with piles of food and water, the news wouldn't show you, and wouldn't let the people have it.
[00:26:46.664 --> 00:26:50.086]  FEMA was giving all the orders, trying to entice a riot.
[00:26:50.627 --> 00:26:51.387]  No, no, no!
[00:26:51.467 --> 00:26:52.668]  You don't get all this water!
[00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:54.189]  No, no, no!
[00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:55.010]  You don't get all this water!
[00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.290]  No, no, no!
[00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.151]  You don't get all this water!
[00:26:56.171 --> 00:26:56.371]  No, no, no!
[00:26:56.391 --> 00:26:58.092]  You don't get all this water!
[00:26:58.112 --> 00:26:58.332]  No, no, no!
[00:26:58.352 --> 00:26:59.133]  You don't get all this water!
[00:26:59.153 --> 00:26:59.313]  No, no, no!
[00:26:59.333 --> 00:26:59.993]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:00.014 --> 00:27:00.174]  No, no, no!
[00:27:00.234 --> 00:27:00.854]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:00.874 --> 00:27:01.034]  No, no, no!
[00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:02.595]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:02.615 --> 00:27:02.896]  No, no, no!
[00:27:02.936 --> 00:27:03.896]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:05.417]  No, no, no!
[00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:06.338]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:06.398 --> 00:27:06.698]  No, no, no!
[00:27:06.718 --> 00:27:07.319]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:08.159]  No, no, no!
[00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:09.941]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.221]  No, no, no!
[00:27:11.241 --> 00:27:12.943]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:12.963 --> 00:27:13.763]  No, no, no!
[00:27:13.843 --> 00:27:14.884]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:15.204]  No, no, no!
[00:27:15.224 --> 00:27:16.185]  You don't get all this water!
[00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:19.962]  Please don't send me an email when I say black bloc.
[00:27:20.022 --> 00:27:21.322]  I'm not talking about black people.
[00:27:21.783 --> 00:27:22.983]  There's three types of anarchists.
[00:27:23.023 --> 00:27:25.424]  Green bloc, red bloc, and black bloc.
[00:27:25.484 --> 00:27:28.045]  Black bloc are like government terrorists usually.
[00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:33.247]  And then there's the red bloc which are communists and the green bloc are environmentalists.
[00:27:33.907 --> 00:27:37.989]  And all of them are just fascistic, globalist, minion troublemakers.
[00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:40.210]  They don't even know their political spectrum.
[00:27:41.949 --> 00:27:45.632]  They'll criticize the free market to your face and then tell you they're anarchist.
[00:27:45.812 --> 00:27:46.353]  Okay.
[00:27:47.414 --> 00:27:49.636]  But, no, that's called communist.
[00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:51.898]  But, and I've dealt with them.
[00:27:51.918 --> 00:27:52.939]  They're feds here locally.
[00:27:52.979 --> 00:27:54.180]  They operate with impunity.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.523]  I've seen them conversing with the police, running their operations.
[00:28:00.485 --> 00:28:01.966]  But in Seattle, it was admitted.
[00:28:02.006 --> 00:28:03.488]  I mean, I made a film about it, The Takeover.
[00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:08.372]  And it was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Weekly, and Seattle Times.
[00:28:08.792 --> 00:28:09.513]  All three of the papers.
[00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:12.811]  And it's in the film.
[00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:16.314]  And we have the police admitting it on tape.
[00:28:16.634 --> 00:28:20.077]  The world sees 60,000 peaceful protesters against the WTO.
[00:28:20.758 --> 00:28:21.739]  Can't put up with that.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.663]  So they called in 50 thugs trained in Oregon at a U.S.
[00:28:25.723 --> 00:28:28.345]  base with big Ford Foundation money.
[00:28:29.606 --> 00:28:30.767]  They walk them in there.
[00:28:30.868 --> 00:28:32.309]  They house them in a government building.
[00:28:32.952 --> 00:28:37.253]  And they let them burn trash cans, knock out windows, and hit cops upside the head with beer bottles?
[00:28:37.853 --> 00:28:41.234]  The cops were ordered, sitting there crying, because they were so mad.
[00:28:41.794 --> 00:28:42.434]  Really pathetic.
[00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:46.175]  I can't believe police would follow criminal orders to let people assault them.
[00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:47.235]  But they'll do it dutifully.
[00:28:47.255 --> 00:28:48.396]  That's called being a slave.
[00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:51.356]  And the news got the images.
[00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.717]  Why don't the cops do something?
[00:28:52.977 --> 00:28:55.037]  All dressed up in their little Darth Vader outfits.
[00:28:55.077 --> 00:28:57.778]  Their black helmets, their black clubs, their black body armor.
[00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:01.514]  Well, when it was raining, their raincoats were like black capes.
[00:29:02.155 --> 00:29:06.699]  Actual Darth Vader outfits that the Feds designed and issued to them under a federal grant.
[00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:13.166]  And then they pulled out those 50 anarchists, as I watched it live, disappeared.
[00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:15.568]  They all ran to their government building.
[00:29:16.275 --> 00:29:19.437]  Right next door, one block from the police station, under police guard.
[00:29:19.898 --> 00:29:23.801]  They began laughing and screaming, stupid, thug teenagers hired.
[00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:25.722]  Delta Force was commanding them.
[00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:28.204]  The hotel down the street where Clinton was staying.
[00:29:29.405 --> 00:29:31.446]  All the news, Delta Force commanding them.
[00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:32.887]  Delta Force.
[00:29:33.147 --> 00:29:33.908]  Delta Force.
[00:29:34.448 --> 00:29:37.290]  Just like the British SAS was caught carrying out terror in Iraq.
[00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:41.133]  And then the police savagely attacked the peaceful protesters.
[00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:45.256]  And the whole world was trained that police should attack protesters.
[00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:47.907]  I'll be right back, but we'll take your calls.
[00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:52.992]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:55.035]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:58.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.351 --> 00:30:08.672]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:30:08.972 --> 00:30:14.254]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:30:14.674 --> 00:30:17.694]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:31:01.972 --> 00:31:08.219]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:14.526]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:23.176]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.476 --> 00:31:30.522]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.802 --> 00:31:35.626]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.846 --> 00:31:41.250]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.633]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:05.174]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:32:05.415 --> 00:32:05.735]  Why?
[00:32:06.075 --> 00:32:08.697]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:32:48.995 --> 00:32:50.795]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:19.672]  By the way, we're hearing all these articles now about martial law and troops running our lives and no due process.
[00:33:20.312 --> 00:33:22.293]  And the media will kind of criticize it.
[00:33:22.373 --> 00:33:23.733]  Oh, that's not very good.
[00:33:24.553 --> 00:33:26.694]  Let's talk to an expert who thinks we should do it.
[00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:30.577]  You didn't expect them to introduce it as absolutely wonderful.
[00:33:30.597 --> 00:33:33.158]  No, they have to ease you into it.
[00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:41.463]  See now, with all these big discussions of it, oh, our media is talking about it.
[00:33:41.983 --> 00:33:43.484]  Our media is dealing with it.
[00:33:43.944 --> 00:33:46.005]  So we'll get more into this CNN article.
[00:33:47.746 --> 00:33:51.888]  Some of the quotes in here sound like they're talking to one of our listeners or something.
[00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:53.449]  To one of us.
[00:33:54.221 --> 00:33:56.382]  Then, Paul Watson wrote a great article yesterday.
[00:33:56.462 --> 00:34:00.223]  Bush cites military takeover in case of flu outbreak.
[00:34:03.164 --> 00:34:11.608]  Five develop nerve disorder after receiving meningitis vaccine from the New York Times, but of course it's just coincidental.
[00:34:12.348 --> 00:34:17.650]  Never mind all these special, very rare, bizarre, or new diseases you get.
[00:34:18.328 --> 00:34:29.553]  I mean, every day there's a couple articles about vaccines causing people to die of bizarre autoimmune diseases, or people basically liquefying in pools of blood, or people taking shots and convulsing and dying.
[00:34:30.293 --> 00:34:32.474]  But never mind, everything's okay.
[00:34:33.115 --> 00:34:34.375]  We'll get into that article later.
[00:34:36.036 --> 00:34:40.818]  And this ruling came out a few days ago, but more details have now been materializing.
[00:34:41.428 --> 00:34:44.991]  Buying of news by Bush aides is ruled illegal!
[00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:46.492]  Really?
[00:34:46.572 --> 00:34:48.733]  You mean covertly paying people off?
[00:34:49.274 --> 00:34:57.499]  Thousands of reporters to lie and push propaganda and spending hundreds of millions of dollars in fake newscasts per issue is illegal?
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.503]  You mean fake news paid for by the White House and the Pentagon is bad?
[00:35:04.544 --> 00:35:10.949]  But again, you tell the general public that they're putting on fake news and they'll laugh at you.
[00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:12.842]  That's ridiculous!
[00:35:12.862 --> 00:35:14.202]  This is America!
[00:35:15.123 --> 00:35:20.265]  And then you prove to them that the news is being paid for and they'll go, well I guess that's good then.
[00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:23.466]  George Bush is in office after all!
[00:35:23.806 --> 00:35:25.407]  Everything must be alright!
[00:35:27.248 --> 00:35:29.649]  George Bush is a sniveling puppet.
[00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:41.114]  And of course this is the New York Times saying this and it's been confirmed that multiple reporters that they have on staff who are now leaving the Times were on the Pentagon payroll.
[00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:45.938]  Buying of news by Bush's aides is ruled illegal.
[00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:47.559]  Let me tell you how else they do it.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.983]  You get a call by a local government agency or by a corporation.
[00:35:52.583 --> 00:36:02.670]  Man, if you do some better reporting on this particular issue, or if you'd stop running those columns by Billy Bob, by the way, this has happened to me in radio.
[00:36:04.011 --> 00:36:06.273]  We'd put a big ad contract down.
[00:36:08.014 --> 00:36:09.155]  How's that sound?
[00:36:10.183 --> 00:36:12.865]  I'll never forget when Mark Keister called me into his office.
[00:36:12.885 --> 00:36:14.686]  He's the guy that gave me my first radio job.
[00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:16.988]  Going back almost 10 years ago now.
[00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.312]  I started out on AXS TV and then about 10 years ago got a radio show.
[00:36:24.774 --> 00:36:30.839]  He liked the TV show so he gave me a weekend show and it got good ratings so I got a weeknight show.
[00:36:31.579 --> 00:36:34.701]  After I'd been on weeknights for about a year he called me in and he goes, Man!
[00:36:36.002 --> 00:36:39.365]  The LCRA just offered us a gigantic contract.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.521]  And they don't advertise with anybody.
[00:36:42.982 --> 00:36:47.947]  But they're really upset about you being on the air, and it could be more money if you weren't on the air.
[00:36:48.827 --> 00:36:52.791]  They don't want any of the ads running in your show.
[00:36:54.152 --> 00:36:58.776]  And they were kind of implying that they don't like you being on, period.
[00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:01.478]  And I said, Mark, why do you think they're offering you all this money?
[00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:05.620]  He said, well, obviously to try to control what we put on, what we do.
[00:37:06.081 --> 00:37:08.242]  He goes, I'm going to take their money, but we're not going to do that.
[00:37:08.462 --> 00:37:09.983]  And they sure enough did run ads.
[00:37:10.563 --> 00:37:11.944]  And then later complained.
[00:37:12.204 --> 00:37:15.005]  And the LCRA, people think it's government.
[00:37:15.025 --> 00:37:15.325]  It's not.
[00:37:15.365 --> 00:37:15.906]  It's private.
[00:37:16.586 --> 00:37:18.987]  But they have governmental power, their own SWAT team.
[00:37:19.007 --> 00:37:20.168]  Again, men with machine guns.
[00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:21.949]  They got men with guns.
[00:37:21.969 --> 00:37:26.711]  You know, like the railroad had its private regulators who'd go around bossing people around.
[00:37:27.933 --> 00:37:32.398]  They go around, they get tax money, and now they basically tax us, but they're private.
[00:37:32.738 --> 00:37:35.861]  They're buying up all the water supplies, jacking up the prices.
[00:37:37.123 --> 00:37:41.567]  But out in all the rural areas, they'll have LCRA fish fries.
[00:37:42.068 --> 00:37:43.249]  Have everybody out.
[00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.592]  That reminds me of John Gotti.
[00:37:45.612 --> 00:37:50.357]  A couple times a year, he'd have big pizza and Italian food for free.
[00:37:52.409 --> 00:37:53.950]  For his neighborhood in Brooklyn.
[00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.191]  And people go, I just like John Gotti.
[00:37:57.552 --> 00:38:02.454]  He buys us pizza and puts on a firework show once a year.
[00:38:03.294 --> 00:38:04.895]  I like the Don.
[00:38:05.355 --> 00:38:06.516]  Same thing with the LCRA.
[00:38:06.776 --> 00:38:08.957]  I like the LCRA, Alex.
[00:38:09.778 --> 00:38:11.959]  Every year I go eat free catfish.
[00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:13.259]  Don't be so stupid.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.541]  See folks, I'll talk to you straight.
[00:38:17.188 --> 00:38:18.069]  These people don't.
[00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:20.030]  They just slime around you.
[00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.333]  I didn't even know who the LCRA was 8 or 9 years ago when that happened.
[00:38:24.734 --> 00:38:26.775]  I mean, I knew they were the Lower Colorado River Authority.
[00:38:27.356 --> 00:38:29.777]  I said, man, I better check into the LCRA.
[00:38:30.338 --> 00:38:33.060]  And boy, did I find out they were a barrel of snakes.
[00:38:35.362 --> 00:38:37.223]  Who thinks that, I mean, who were scared of me?
[00:38:38.507 --> 00:38:40.028]  I'm talking bad about the New World Order.
[00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:41.529]  I'm talking bad about Bill Clinton.
[00:38:41.609 --> 00:38:45.272]  I mean, I was pretty mainline conservative at that point.
[00:38:45.332 --> 00:38:57.260]  I'd talk about the Federal Reserve and stuff like that, and talk about the loss of liberty and the police state being set up, and they're the big dogs around here.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.061]  They'd say, hey, who is that?
[00:39:00.462 --> 00:39:05.766]  They got unlimited money, billions of bucks to throw around, so hey, we don't like him.
[00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:07.567]  There's big money in
[00:39:08.487 --> 00:39:11.068]  Keepin' your boy under, under heel.
[00:39:13.049 --> 00:39:18.411]  So, uh, buying of news by Bush's aides is ruled illegal.
[00:39:20.672 --> 00:39:22.153]  We'll, uh, go more into that.
[00:39:22.313 --> 00:39:24.294]  FBI joins drills on nuke terror.
[00:39:24.694 --> 00:39:25.415]  Military U.S.
[00:39:25.455 --> 00:39:28.796]  law enforcement step up WMD exercises.
[00:39:30.817 --> 00:39:33.678]  Arrests made in brutal attacks on immigrants.
[00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:37.380]  This is from the Associated Press, but notice it doesn't get picked up.
[00:39:38.152 --> 00:39:42.973]  Investigators, 14 farm laborers, rape Florida routine.
[00:39:45.014 --> 00:39:46.094]  All 14 of them!
[00:39:47.355 --> 00:39:52.296]  But two white guys raped an illegal alien's wife, and it wasn't racially motivated, they were just criminals.
[00:39:52.816 --> 00:39:56.517]  And it's international news, the evil white scourge.
[00:39:58.078 --> 00:40:06.280]  But it's everyday scores of articles, scores of them, where it is racially motivated.
[00:40:07.506 --> 00:40:09.847]  By our wonderful little illegal aliens.
[00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:15.890]  And it hits the local news, but you'll never hear about it on national TV.
[00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:20.092]  Those statistics aren't going to be kept by the hate crimes people.
[00:40:21.613 --> 00:40:23.314]  Tim, now dead, from Toronto.
[00:40:23.414 --> 00:40:24.354]  Mystery illness.
[00:40:24.474 --> 00:40:25.635]  We'll go over that.
[00:40:25.695 --> 00:40:28.917]  And Bush wants, again, Reich Seegs military coming up.
[00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:31.658]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:40:32.238 --> 00:40:33.339]  Let's talk to Micah.
[00:40:34.019 --> 00:40:35.440]  Micah, where are you calling us from today?
[00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:37.541]  Colin from Myrtle Beach, Alex.
[00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:41.402]  I spoke to you last week about the hydrogen bomb off of Savannah.
[00:40:42.062 --> 00:40:47.504]  Yeah, that old hydrogen bomb that got dumped by a fighter bomber back in the 50s, right?
[00:40:48.204 --> 00:40:48.704]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:48.964 --> 00:41:00.267]  In 1958, a B-47 made a mid-air collision with another fighter jet, and he intentionally ditched it so as not to crash land with a nuclear device and have a possible detonation on our soil.
[00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:02.067]  I can understand that if that's the story.
[00:41:02.682 --> 00:41:04.843]  But, um, I'm getting some mixed reviews.
[00:41:05.224 --> 00:41:09.226]  I, um, do you mind if I say the search engine that I used to get this information?
[00:41:11.348 --> 00:41:12.268]  I don't censor people.
[00:41:13.169 --> 00:41:16.511]  Okay, uh, I went on Yahoo's search engine.
[00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:21.954]  I searched the web with these words, nuclear bomb off coast.
[00:41:22.875 --> 00:41:24.696]  And I got 2,530,000 hits.
[00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:24.796]  Um,
[00:41:29.312 --> 00:41:30.313]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:41:30.394 --> 00:41:33.798]  Why would you ask permission to plug a search engine?
[00:41:34.499 --> 00:41:37.823]  Because Alex, I'm not used to shows that are as loose as yours in real America.
[00:41:37.843 --> 00:41:47.596]  And I'm used to these other AM freakers out there that just really don't give any credence and they make you basically banter to them so you can get on the air.
[00:41:48.368 --> 00:41:55.994]  I sat through the whole duration of the Matt Drudge Show just to get the word out about the Pakistanis having the Augusta class B submarine.
[00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:15.120]  You know, because I thought it newsworthy, and they did too.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.480]  They said, yeah, we're going to get you on next.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.480]  We're going to get you on next.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.001]  Next thing you know, I waited three hours, the show was over.
[00:42:20.021 --> 00:42:26.442]  But that, anyways, aside from those... Did they ever get you on?
[00:42:26.762 --> 00:42:29.103]  What I wanted to get to... Sir, did they ever get you on?
[00:42:29.123 --> 00:42:29.963]  No, sir.
[00:42:29.983 --> 00:42:31.083]  No, not at all.
[00:42:31.123 --> 00:42:38.665]  Well, see, that's because they thought it was worthy, but Lord Grudge knows, as an important operative in the New World Order, what he can and can't do.
[00:42:39.505 --> 00:42:43.028]  Well, it didn't have a semen stain on it, so he probably was not interested in it.
[00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.110]  What was your other point?
[00:42:48.091 --> 00:42:48.712]  My other point?
[00:42:48.752 --> 00:43:01.521]  The Atlanta Constitution, September 8, 2000, had a report that said specifically in these words, Air Force denies nuclear unexploded device off Georgia-South Carolina coast.
[00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:07.485]  A 2001 report stated that the Air Force commented it was irretrievably lost.
[00:43:08.454 --> 00:43:23.848]  And just one other quick point, in 1958, uh, Secretary of Defense Howard, I believe that's who it was, um, allegedly sent a memo concerning this to the President, and it said, uh, I'll mark this down, like I said, all off the internet.
[00:43:23.908 --> 00:43:26.010]  Okay, sir, go ahead and show it.
[00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.533]  Okay, complete nuclear bomb with its plutonium capsules installed.
[00:43:30.083 --> 00:43:32.004]  It is better left buried in the seabed.
[00:43:32.044 --> 00:43:34.545]  Well, retired U.S.
[00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:39.487]  Air Force Colonel Derek Duke and Harris Parker, a treasure hunter, allegedly found it.
[00:43:39.887 --> 00:43:45.789]  Alex, it's allegedly within 15 to 20 miles from downtown Savannah and less than 20 feet of water.
[00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:50.431]  Well, it can't detonate now, thanks for the call.
[00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:59.374]  I don't know if you've studied how they build hydrogen bombs, but it's uranium jacketing plutonium.
[00:44:00.581 --> 00:44:08.907]  So, instead of basically an A-bomb, an atomic bomb is uranium.
[00:44:10.828 --> 00:44:12.489]  And a hydrogen bomb is plutonium.
[00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:23.617]  And the primitive A-bombs fire a bullet of plutonium into the uranium.
[00:44:26.018 --> 00:44:27.680]  And there's a bunch of different configurations.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.361]  I don't claim to be an expert on it, but
[00:44:29.975 --> 00:44:40.658]  They then jacket all of that with a perfectly spherical mass of high explosive, plastic explosive.
[00:44:41.418 --> 00:44:53.942]  That explodes and focuses the energy, because of metal jacketing around that, inwards onto the uranium, which then explodes and compacts into the plutonium.
[00:44:55.862 --> 00:44:59.003]  And believe me, it's a radioactive mess
[00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:02.913]  And it's not good for you, I'll assure you.
[00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:08.098]  Not good for anybody that eats fish, obviously, caught in that area.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.563]  But at the same time, the ocean eats through metal.
[00:45:15.544 --> 00:45:24.932]  And I would say that within an hour of the water getting into that bomb, that it was inoperable.
[00:45:27.295 --> 00:45:46.947]  And the problem with nukes is, even when they're supposedly perfectly milled and designed, and hydrogen bombs are a lot more complex, hydrogen warheads are a lot more complex than A-bombs, that if it doesn't go off just right, it doesn't detonate.
[00:45:47.007 --> 00:45:54.752]  That pressure has to be perfectly focused in to compact those radioactive materials so they didn't go critical.
[00:45:55.589 --> 00:46:00.935]  Start bouncing around so fast that it causes an explosion.
[00:46:01.656 --> 00:46:03.998]  Because all those atoms are bouncing around so fast.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:17.112]  But everybody knows, and I haven't checked into this but I'll take your word on it, everybody knows that that bomb in the late 50's
[00:46:18.539 --> 00:46:19.720]  Was ditched in the ocean.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.922]  I mean, it was all over TV at the time, all over radio at the time.
[00:46:23.422 --> 00:46:25.043]  It was all over the newspapers at the time.
[00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:28.786]  I mean, I've seen TV shows about it on television, and I don't watch much TV.
[00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:31.047]  So, I mean, it must, everybody must know about it.
[00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:35.330]  I mean, if I know about it, uh, it's all over the place.
[00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:41.574]  But, but, what I take your word on, what I don't know, is that the military is now denying it's there.
[00:46:43.295 --> 00:46:44.796]  But that is par for the course.
[00:46:45.596 --> 00:46:46.697]  With everything else they do now.
[00:46:47.293 --> 00:46:59.042]  I mean, the just bold-faced lying that goes on now, where they just change their stories on a daily basis, and they're openly proven to be liars, and no one is held accountable.
[00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:07.329]  So I fully believe you that they're on the news saying there's no hydrogen bomb off the shore of South Carolina.
[00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.150]  I mean, I believe you.
[00:47:11.092 --> 00:47:13.714]  I'm sure if I type it into Google, I'll find that.
[00:47:14.543 --> 00:47:17.444]  And, uh, clearly this just shows what liars they are.
[00:47:18.105 --> 00:47:27.089]  I mean, going through the news this morning, I mean, there were just, literally, there's a whole bunch of articles here where it's just bald-faced lies!
[00:47:28.289 --> 00:47:29.790]  I've never seen such lying!
[00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:34.893]  I mean, in contradicting themselves on a daily basis, and the media doesn't even challenge it!
[00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:37.934]  But remember,
[00:47:38.536 --> 00:47:44.098]  Four years ago, the Pentagon said, we're going to lie to you from now on for your own interest.
[00:47:44.498 --> 00:47:51.120]  We're going to run domestic propaganda to the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence.
[00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:56.442]  And then their first official announcement after that was, strike that, we're not going to lie to you.
[00:47:57.262 --> 00:48:02.124]  So somehow their lawyers think they're covered by going, okay, everything now is going to be a lie.
[00:48:04.088 --> 00:48:05.330]  And I mean, remember Pat Gilman?
[00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:06.051]  Total lie.
[00:48:06.511 --> 00:48:07.072]  Private Lynch?
[00:48:07.292 --> 00:48:07.633]  Fable.
[00:48:07.813 --> 00:48:08.494]  Total lie.
[00:48:08.734 --> 00:48:10.035]  Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
[00:48:10.256 --> 00:48:11.838]  He actually produced that lie.
[00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:22.451]  He actually, with the Pentagon, over satellite TV, when they knew that she'd been rescued, described how to do it, how to kick the doors down, how to act like the Delta Force went up against all these enemies.
[00:48:27.364 --> 00:48:34.606]  So, I mean, this government has lost all credibility, but there is this crowd in America who thinks that being patriotic is worshipping the government.
[00:48:34.646 --> 00:48:39.007]  And folks, if you knew history, and again, I've been really talking down to people lately.
[00:48:39.367 --> 00:48:41.087]  I'm not talking to our general audience.
[00:48:41.607 --> 00:48:48.629]  I know there's a big group of people tuning in for the first time, people driving along in their cars for the first time, listening to this, and you know what?
[00:48:48.669 --> 00:48:51.470]  I want to slap that smile off your face!
[00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.250]  I'm going to talk to you straight!
[00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.131]  Being a gibbering idiot is not cute!
[00:48:56.994 --> 00:49:00.015]  And laughing at what I'm saying right now is not funny.
[00:49:03.956 --> 00:49:06.637]  You may think freedom is troops shoving guns in your face.
[00:49:06.978 --> 00:49:11.119]  And you may think freedom is the government cramming Ritalin down your child's throat.
[00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:16.061]  And you may think freedom is a lowering standard of living and the dollar devalued by 45%.
[00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:19.102]  You know, that's another scam.
[00:49:19.462 --> 00:49:21.523]  Bush cuts taxes roughly by about 6-7%.
[00:49:23.467 --> 00:49:27.168]  For some people in a $200,000 plus dollar a year level, I'm told it's even more.
[00:49:28.948 --> 00:49:30.248]  I'm always for tax cuts.
[00:49:30.948 --> 00:49:34.469]  But not if you radically increase spending, doubling the growth of government.
[00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:35.429]  Which he did.
[00:49:35.949 --> 00:49:36.810]  Now I'm against it.
[00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.831]  Then you've got the argument of, well, when you cut taxes, it actually generates even more money.
[00:49:43.131 --> 00:49:43.831]  Into the treasury.
[00:49:43.851 --> 00:49:44.811]  Not at this level.
[00:49:44.851 --> 00:49:45.411]  No, it doesn't.
[00:49:45.671 --> 00:49:46.291]  Look at the numbers.
[00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:47.012]  Look at the deficit.
[00:49:47.972 --> 00:49:49.072]  But it's worse than that.
[00:49:52.017 --> 00:49:57.539]  They've devalued, they've printed five trillion dollars in the last three years.
[00:49:58.539 --> 00:49:59.700]  Five trillion.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.620]  That's just in money they've printed.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:07.222]  And then they can loan out ten times that the banks can on their ballot sheet.
[00:50:07.262 --> 00:50:08.442]  It's just zeros and ones.
[00:50:09.403 --> 00:50:11.924]  The money you think you've got in the bank is just zeros and ones, folks.
[00:50:12.884 --> 00:50:15.125]  The dollar has, I'm really mad about this.
[00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:19.146]  A little bit of money I got in the bank for my children's, you know, college someday,
[00:50:20.245 --> 00:50:21.407]  Do they choose to go to college?
[00:50:21.807 --> 00:50:22.468]  It's worthless.
[00:50:22.488 --> 00:50:23.509]  I don't even have any money.
[00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:26.993]  It's like the peso or something.
[00:50:27.474 --> 00:50:27.994]  And you know what?
[00:50:28.135 --> 00:50:30.818]  Mexicans in Mexico know what it is to have a weak currency.
[00:50:31.511 --> 00:50:33.552]  I talked to full-grown adults in business.
[00:50:34.212 --> 00:50:35.953]  People making $100,000 a year.
[00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:41.236]  These people, they know how to play golf, they know how to act cool, they know how to drive around in an SUV.
[00:50:41.536 --> 00:50:44.657]  They don't even know what it means to have the dollar devalued.
[00:50:45.098 --> 00:50:48.299]  I mean, there is like a group of retarded people out there.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.320]  I mean, educated idiots.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.602]  They got high IQs, but they're dumber than some
[00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:58.907]  Immigrant from India who doesn't have five dollars in their pocket.
[00:51:03.149 --> 00:51:06.011]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.251 --> 00:51:07.831]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.172 --> 00:51:12.854]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.194 --> 00:51:17.616]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:22.218]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.438 --> 00:51:25.280]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.043]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.223 --> 00:51:34.666]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.866 --> 00:51:42.091]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:44.793]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.933 --> 00:51:46.654]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:52:02.146 --> 00:52:09.652]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.952 --> 00:52:20.861]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:21.121 --> 00:52:22.923]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:23.183 --> 00:52:26.506]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:37.295]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.595 --> 00:52:38.096]  That's right!
[00:52:38.276 --> 00:52:45.403]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.683 --> 00:52:49.807]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:54.432]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:54.452 --> 00:52:54.932]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.993 --> 00:53:09.936]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:10.156 --> 00:53:12.397]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:12.598 --> 00:53:18.961]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:19.942]  I think so.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:39.780]  I think so.
[00:54:04.384 --> 00:54:10.408]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:11.049 --> 00:54:13.991]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.954]  By the way, we need to get thicker skin.
[00:54:20.135 --> 00:54:30.543]  Nobody called in to complain, but when I call yuppies retarded, I don't mean... I have family members that are brain damaged.
[00:54:30.603 --> 00:54:31.364]  I have an uncle who
[00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.171]  Got a motorcycle accident and his brain damaged.
[00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:37.373]  I have a sweet little cousin who is brain damaged.
[00:54:37.393 --> 00:54:40.995]  So I'm not, when I say retarded, I'm not making fun of people like that.
[00:54:41.616 --> 00:54:45.979]  I mean willfully, willfully stupid is what I mean.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:55:00.267]  I mean, I talk to educated people with degrees and I go, do you understand, would you rather have a 7% tax cut or would you rather have your dollar not be valued by 45%?
[00:55:01.969 --> 00:55:04.450]  And they'll sit there and argue with you that there's no inflation.
[00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:09.052]  It's just basic, basic.
[00:55:10.052 --> 00:55:13.034]  Two plus two equals... Folks, I'm not that smart!
[00:55:13.854 --> 00:55:15.355]  I'm just an average Texan.
[00:55:17.015 --> 00:55:18.616]  And I mean, I can see what's going on.
[00:55:18.656 --> 00:55:20.937]  They're turning this place upside down.
[00:55:20.997 --> 00:55:23.498]  I love this country so much, and I've really been angry lately.
[00:55:23.798 --> 00:55:25.139]  I apologize to the audience.
[00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:27.661]  I just can't help it.
[00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:28.941]  I mean, I cannot help it.
[00:55:29.742 --> 00:55:55.807]  I read about them killing little children for their organs in China, and how our government gives them all these funds, and the UN gives them all these awards, and I read about how, you know, the horrible things our government's doing over here, and I read about, you know, biological testing on our own population, and on other populations, and I just look at the things our government does to us, and all the things, and it just, it freaks me out.
[00:55:56.539 --> 00:55:59.923]  To turn on TV and the President saying, I want to use troops on you.
[00:56:00.383 --> 00:56:01.344]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:56:02.465 --> 00:56:09.713]  When I know they've been planning for this forever to confiscate guns, now they've got Dutch and Mexican troops and British troops here in America.
[00:56:10.915 --> 00:56:16.881]  Everything we've always talked about and now it's happening and I just know that it's coming down.
[00:56:17.121 --> 00:56:18.463]  I know in my gut
[00:56:19.222 --> 00:56:21.163]  That the time is short, folks.
[00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:25.486]  I know that they know the time is short, and I'm gonna tell you right now, I can just tell you.
[00:56:25.826 --> 00:56:28.808]  With all the evidence and all the indicators, bad stuff's gonna start happening.
[00:56:29.769 --> 00:56:31.150]  And we're very close to it.
[00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:35.252]  And, you know, I should be focused and trying to rally the troops at this point in time.
[00:56:35.913 --> 00:56:38.514]  It's just that at a primitive level, I just get mad.
[00:56:39.695 --> 00:56:40.376]  And I am mad.
[00:56:40.556 --> 00:56:41.516]  And we should be mad.
[00:56:42.197 --> 00:56:43.718]  I guess I really shouldn't apologize.
[00:56:43.758 --> 00:56:45.659]  I just know it's obnoxious to listen to sometimes.
[00:56:48.621 --> 00:56:49.922]  A lot of you tell me to get madder.
[00:56:49.942 --> 00:56:50.962]  You know, you appreciate it.
[00:56:50.982 --> 00:56:53.364]  I just... No, I don't like feeling like this.
[00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:55.785]  And, uh, I love this country.
[00:56:55.845 --> 00:57:05.569]  And I am just... A pack of criminals has seized control of it, is literally looting it, strip-mining everything our forefathers and mothers built.
[00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:15.674]  And I gotta watch these smiley-faced criminals, who I know are just the scum of the earth, up on TV, posing as our saviors, and it makes my blood boil!
[00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:22.654]  Anton in Texas, then Lorendo and Robert and many others.
[00:57:22.694 --> 00:57:23.474]  Go ahead, Anton.
[00:57:24.515 --> 00:57:25.616]  Great show, Alex.
[00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:34.103]  I got a question about concealed handgun licenses and your opinion on them in Texas, and if you think that would aid in a gun competition.
[00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:38.547]  I just recently bought me some guns, a person-to-person sale here in Texas.
[00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:39.127]  You can do that.
[00:57:39.147 --> 00:57:42.910]  Of course, you know, and I just want to know your opinion on concealed handgun licenses.
[00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:46.073]  Does that would aid in them coming to take your gun or not?
[00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:50.891]  It's a very complex issue, but on the face of it, it's bad.
[00:57:51.931 --> 00:57:55.691]  And I know people who give the course and have it, and they'll tell you it's bad.
[00:57:56.332 --> 00:58:03.813]  But they do it for a certain reason, which I actually agree with them on, and it's, it's, it's... First off, it turns a right into a privilege.
[00:58:04.473 --> 00:58:07.614]  I am for a Vermont-style concealed carry.
[00:58:08.294 --> 00:58:12.434]  Vermont has the lowest crime rate in the Union, and you want to carry a concealed gun?
[00:58:12.454 --> 00:58:14.395]  Voila!
[00:58:15.055 --> 00:58:15.375]  Do it.
[00:58:16.016 --> 00:58:22.441]  And the concealed part's great because it doesn't scare all the idiots, the domesticated slime who's afraid to see another slave with a weapon.
[00:58:23.482 --> 00:58:32.910]  And, uh, it's like at the slave camps 200 years ago, you know, the blacks that wanted freedom could never do anything because the rest of the blacks would go cattle on them.
[00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:37.714]  Look, he, he, Wilford's got a knife hidden under his, under his shirt.
[00:58:37.754 --> 00:58:38.955]  Get him!
[00:58:38.975 --> 00:58:39.956]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:46.346]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:58.611]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.271 --> 00:59:00.352]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.053 --> 00:59:02.174]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.815 --> 00:59:03.616]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.376 --> 00:59:05.277]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.938 --> 00:59:09.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.142 --> 00:59:14.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.981 --> 00:59:24.602]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:24.622 --> 00:59:30.565]  We are now into hour number two, and I've been ranting and raving the last hour, and frankly, we should be ranting and raving.
[00:59:31.165 --> 00:59:36.848]  Even CNN has the headline that Bush is proposing martial law, permanent martial law in America.
[00:59:37.685 --> 00:59:42.669]  The troops aren't just going to be used when there's an avian flu problem or a bird flu or a flood.
[00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:51.397]  It's going to be used to literally run checkpoints and aim guns at you and search you and train you how to live in a Red Dawn scenario.
[00:59:51.597 --> 00:59:54.099]  Remember in the movie Red Dawn, whenever they go in the grocery store?
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.762]  They're like, shh, you shouldn't even be in town.
[00:59:58.162 --> 00:59:58.983]  Where's my Paul?
[00:59:59.383 --> 01:00:02.146]  He's at the re-education camp at the old sports stadium.
[01:00:03.044 --> 01:00:07.445]  And they look up and the military officer is walking along upstairs looking down at them.
[01:00:07.725 --> 01:00:10.786]  I mean, folks, that's how they live in scum countries!
[01:00:11.706 --> 01:00:12.906]  This is America!
[01:00:13.587 --> 01:00:15.307]  And I don't want to hear it's for security.
[01:00:15.627 --> 01:00:32.231]  That border is completely wide open and that little murdering whore in the White House, that little limp-wristed fairy up there with a bunch of scum, a bunch of soft scum that thinks we're their slaves!
[01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:35.286]  You've been buffaloing us far too long!
[01:00:35.386 --> 01:00:36.326]  I'm sick of it!
[01:00:37.387 --> 01:00:37.907]  Okay, stop.
[01:00:39.468 --> 01:00:40.389]  I just can't help it, man.
[01:00:40.409 --> 01:00:42.150]  I'm getting more and more sick of these people.
[01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:44.692]  And you know why I've been mad lately?
[01:00:44.712 --> 01:00:48.274]  Shooting my mouth off at people, other patriots that run around griping and complaining.
[01:00:48.595 --> 01:00:50.236]  This whole country's going down.
[01:00:51.216 --> 01:00:53.458]  This whole country's on the edge of being over.
[01:00:53.698 --> 01:00:54.499]  You understand that?
[01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:58.021]  Of the real estate bubble popping, of depression, everything!
[01:00:58.281 --> 01:00:59.302]  It could really happen!
[01:01:01.152 --> 01:01:02.573]  And what are the other Patriots doing?
[01:01:02.773 --> 01:01:09.277]  They're running around backstabbing, sneaking, running around on egomaniac trips when it's almost all over, folks.
[01:01:10.478 --> 01:01:11.899]  I'm sorry to have to talk like that.
[01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:13.140]  We got a lot of hope.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.541]  A lot of good things are happening.
[01:01:15.722 --> 01:01:18.543]  There's masses of news coming up and your calls, of course.
[01:01:19.164 --> 01:01:22.246]  I just... Anton calls in asking about concealed carry.
[01:01:22.526 --> 01:01:25.528]  It turns a right into a privilege if you have Texas style.
[01:01:26.866 --> 01:01:28.667]  Why do you need to be fingerprinted like a criminal?
[01:01:28.867 --> 01:01:30.589]  Why do you need to have background checks done?
[01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:32.350]  Why do you have to take training courses?
[01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:39.275]  Why do you have to do all of this to do something that's God-given, that our forefathers literally bled to death for?
[01:01:39.995 --> 01:01:43.297]  Cannonballs, blowing their guts out, arms and legs off.
[01:01:45.359 --> 01:01:48.501]  Everything we've got is off the blood of other people.
[01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:51.063]  We are disgusting, spoiled brats.
[01:01:52.463 --> 01:01:59.548]  But then you can argue that if the system is so corrupt it's a stopgap to protect society to have those concealed carries.
[01:01:59.808 --> 01:02:05.111]  We know crime rates go down about 20% once a good portion of the public has it after about two years.
[01:02:05.871 --> 01:02:13.356]  That go ahead and admit we're in a corrupt system, go ahead and get the license, go ahead and jump through the hoops to try to protect society.
[01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:17.319]  And so that's the argument to have concealed carry.
[01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:19.360]  I say Vermont concealed carry.
[01:02:20.347 --> 01:02:23.209]  And then if you commit a crime with that gun, throw the book at you.
[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.050]  But you know what?
[01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:29.815]  The people that do carry concealed carry, who aren't criminals, they got better track records than cops.
[01:02:31.636 --> 01:02:32.977]  And so you don't have to worry about it.
[01:02:34.278 --> 01:02:35.980]  Hey, Anton, does that answer your question?
[01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:38.262]  Anton's gone.
[01:02:38.302 --> 01:02:40.103]  Okay, I told him the whole, so I can answer his question.
[01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:42.325]  Well, I hope that answered it, Bubba.
[01:02:44.086 --> 01:02:44.947]  Who's up next here?
[01:02:47.289 --> 01:02:48.230]  Robert in Tennessee.
[01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:48.890]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:49.791]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:50.697 --> 01:02:52.018]  I've spoke to you in the past.
[01:02:52.419 --> 01:02:53.860]  I just wanted to ask again.
[01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:58.546]  I called GCN Live and asked them why I can never hear you.
[01:02:58.626 --> 01:03:02.351]  I live 90 miles, 80 miles northeast of Nashville.
[01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:06.716]  During the day, I hear you perfect at night, 99% of the time.
[01:03:07.377 --> 01:03:09.259]  During the day, I can't hear you at all.
[01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:09.840]  Period.
[01:03:10.464 --> 01:03:21.987]  Well, sir, that's because you're in the state where the 100,000-watt blowtorch shortwaver is, and because it's so powerful that you can't hear it in your own state.
[01:03:22.348 --> 01:03:29.430]  I don't know how to get into all the mathematics and how radio works, but you're in the skip zone.
[01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.751]  And so, because it's worldwide, it's literally shooting over your head.
[01:03:36.539 --> 01:03:39.121]  You understand WWCR is in the same state as you?
[01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:40.963]  Correct, yeah, I understand that.
[01:03:41.123 --> 01:03:41.923]  It's in Nashville.
[01:03:42.484 --> 01:03:42.684]  Yeah.
[01:03:43.305 --> 01:03:47.528]  And so, uh, I'm told that about, just as you said, 90 miles.
[01:03:47.568 --> 01:03:51.171]  I'm told about 100 miles around there, you just can't pick it up.
[01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:52.252]  Some of their frequencies.
[01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:55.171]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.311 --> 01:03:58.413]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:02.416]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.476 --> 01:04:06.719]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.822]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.922 --> 01:04:12.844]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.984 --> 01:04:16.286]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:17.407]  The medical bills!
[01:04:19.008 --> 01:04:21.049]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.189 --> 01:04:24.231]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.411 --> 01:04:27.293]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.754 --> 01:04:33.878]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.398 --> 01:04:38.202]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:53.118 --> 01:04:56.601]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:04:56.861 --> 01:05:00.364]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.465 --> 01:05:04.408]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.628 --> 01:05:10.794]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.194 --> 01:05:19.101]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.501 --> 01:05:24.842]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.002 --> 01:05:28.783]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.143 --> 01:05:30.983]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.063 --> 01:05:33.223]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:38.404]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:05:38.444 --> 01:05:43.985]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:53.189 --> 01:06:01.115]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[01:06:01.676 --> 01:06:02.997]  What happened to those prices?
[01:06:03.537 --> 01:06:05.239]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:12.805]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[01:06:13.245 --> 01:06:13.785]  The result?
[01:06:14.226 --> 01:06:15.487]  Inflation was born.
[01:06:16.007 --> 01:06:18.069]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:20.912]  What can you do about it?
[01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:23.656]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[01:06:24.503 --> 01:06:29.826]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[01:06:30.267 --> 01:06:35.430]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.352]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:06:38.372 --> 01:06:40.493]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[01:06:40.513 --> 01:06:43.295]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now!
[01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:58.768]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:00.490]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:02.332]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.973 --> 01:07:03.793]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:05.415]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.116 --> 01:07:09.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:14.405]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.347 --> 01:07:22.651]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:22.712 --> 01:07:27.015]  Eight minutes, thirty seconds into the second hour of the transmission against Kerening.
[01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:28.596]  I'm going to try to focus now.
[01:07:28.616 --> 01:07:30.857]  We've got Paul Watson riding shotgun with us.
[01:07:30.977 --> 01:07:35.981]  We will talk to Lenando, or Lorando, I'm not sure how to pronounce it.
[01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:41.192]  And we'll talk to Annette and Rita and just many others that are holding.
[01:07:41.652 --> 01:07:44.093]  Pull free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:44.113 --> 01:07:55.898]  A really nice caller called in the last segment, Robert, who can't listen to us on shortwave, there, I think he said he's like 90 miles north of Nashville.
[01:07:56.759 --> 01:07:59.800]  Well, WWCR is based in Nashville.
[01:08:00.721 --> 01:08:05.923]  And on certain frequencies, when you've got a big 100,000 watt transmitter, it skips.
[01:08:07.395 --> 01:08:08.976]  That is, the frequency goes over you.
[01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:12.538]  And I'm told about a hundred miles around there, some of their frequencies you can't hear.
[01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:16.060]  You know, it'll come in like FM radio in Timbuktu.
[01:08:16.921 --> 01:08:17.381]  Literally.
[01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:18.942]  You know, in Beijing, China.
[01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:22.944]  It'll come in like literal FM radio here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:23.525 --> 01:08:26.446]  I mean, some of WWCR's frequencies, I mean, it's like a joke.
[01:08:26.927 --> 01:08:28.808]  It sounds better than FM radio.
[01:08:29.268 --> 01:08:30.108]  That's an exaggeration.
[01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:31.909]  It sounds better than local AMs.
[01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:34.451]  I mean, and it just explodes out of the speaker.
[01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:37.651]  And if there's a sunspot or something, though, you can't hear it.
[01:08:38.231 --> 01:08:39.932]  But we're going to have new frequencies at night.
[01:08:39.972 --> 01:08:42.333]  During the day, we're like, what, 9.985?
[01:08:43.054 --> 01:08:45.195]  But at night, the first hour is now 7.461.
[01:08:45.235 --> 01:08:45.195]  7.461.
[01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:46.776]  And the second and third hour is 5.765.
[01:08:46.816 --> 01:08:46.776]  5.765.
[01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.376]  Second and third hour, nine to midnight.
[01:08:48.396 --> 01:08:50.717]  So first hour, 7.461, and second and third hour, 5.765.
[01:09:05.769 --> 01:09:14.053]  And at the end of October, all three hours will be on 5.765, which is just a blow towards frequency.
[01:09:14.594 --> 01:09:16.435]  We really appreciate them giving us that frequency.
[01:09:16.755 --> 01:09:21.177]  It's better than 32.10 at night.
[01:09:21.898 --> 01:09:32.223]  You probably have no problem listening to us right outside Nashville on 32.10 right now, sir, at night, because that is more of a, I believe, I'm not an expert on four-way, my uncle's a ham, that's more of a short-range frequency.
[01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:34.348]  And it still bounces.
[01:09:34.368 --> 01:09:39.983]  You can still hear it around the world, but its bounces are, I guess, smaller.
[01:09:40.564 --> 01:09:41.848]  You know, a smaller curve.
[01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:49.469]  And it gets, again, all off into mathematics, but that's why you can hear 3210, because it has small bounces.
[01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:55.073]  Whereas the big 5.765s and things like that, and the higher up you go, have longer bounces.
[01:09:55.493 --> 01:09:57.174]  And this is probably all wrong.
[01:09:57.214 --> 01:10:02.858]  I probably get a hundred calls from ham radio operators telling me what an idiot I am, and I am an idiot on some issues.
[01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:07.341]  That's just what memory serves me on this.
[01:10:08.141 --> 01:10:11.003]  One more program note that I'm going back to Paul Watson and your calls.
[01:10:12.373 --> 01:10:13.774]  I have held my tongue about this.
[01:10:15.255 --> 01:10:18.337]  I've been too busy fighting the New World Order to really worry about it.
[01:10:19.378 --> 01:10:21.099]  But it is the heart of the New World Order.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:31.265]  Censorship is not, oh, Alex Jones won't have Satanists on promoting Satanism as a religion.
[01:10:33.106 --> 01:10:39.891]  No, if I went and wouldn't let the Satanists practice their bowing down before a pentagram and Lucifer,
[01:10:40.989 --> 01:10:42.469]  That would be censorship.
[01:10:43.249 --> 01:10:46.310]  Or if I wouldn't let them publish a newsletter saying they love the devil.
[01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:48.250]  That would be censorship.
[01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:51.491]  Not having it on my show is not censorship.
[01:10:52.171 --> 01:11:03.793]  Censorship is the government or corporations, media corporations with the government blocking out, shutting down your website, shutting down your newspaper, shutting down your radio station.
[01:11:05.993 --> 01:11:09.934]  And everything Jim Tucker gets out of the Bilderberg Group unfortunately comes true.
[01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:15.014]  He says a year before, well we heard they're going to bring down the Berlin Wall in a staged event.
[01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:17.955]  It happens exactly when he says.
[01:11:18.756 --> 01:11:22.458]  He says we're not invading in 2002 as they're saying in March.
[01:11:22.798 --> 01:11:23.979]  It's March of 03.
[01:11:24.799 --> 01:11:27.921]  A year before, exactly as he said, exactly happened.
[01:11:27.941 --> 01:11:34.605]  Because we have spies inside where the actual world leaders, 125 of them, with 75 globalist minions who come to get orders, meet
[01:11:40.351 --> 01:11:45.615]  And we infiltrate them, just like we just infiltrated the Bohemian Grove again, and got even more footage and info.
[01:11:46.155 --> 01:11:52.519]  And membership list, and who was speaking, and who was talking, and what was going on, including David Gergen, by the way, one of the distinguished speakers.
[01:11:53.019 --> 01:11:54.901]  So, this is how we get the job done.
[01:11:56.682 --> 01:12:03.346]  And this year, they said, we gotta do something about the internet, we gotta do something about American truth-seekers, they call us Christian Patriots.
[01:12:03.866 --> 01:12:04.667]  We are hurting them.
[01:12:05.245 --> 01:12:06.806]  And then that was the main focus.
[01:12:06.886 --> 01:12:08.848]  We have got to shut them down.
[01:12:09.508 --> 01:12:13.932]  And so right on target, their agents in the Patriot movement have started attacking.
[01:12:15.273 --> 01:12:17.094]  Just sheer absolute indicator.
[01:12:17.275 --> 01:12:18.656]  You never hear us doing that, folks.
[01:12:18.976 --> 01:12:22.218]  When you see people doing that pathologically over and over again, you know.
[01:12:22.999 --> 01:12:26.222]  Trying to create dissension in the ranks because they know we're moving against them.
[01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:33.537]  And the main message is restrict our speech so they're about to pass the hate crimes law.
[01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:37.438]  Which will probably end up, in the process, kicking us off the air.
[01:12:38.398 --> 01:12:39.439]  Because you talk about anything.
[01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:42.339]  You talk bad about the IMF and World Bank bugs, you can be arrested.
[01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:44.880]  You read Old Testament passages, you can be arrested.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:45.960]  I mean, it's in the bill.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.261]  This isn't a joke.
[01:12:49.341 --> 01:12:52.062]  I know, you didn't think the Supreme Court would rule we don't have private property.
[01:12:52.282 --> 01:12:53.762]  You didn't think they'd do all this stuff.
[01:12:54.022 --> 01:12:56.103]  Look, you didn't think foreign troops would be here!
[01:12:56.403 --> 01:12:57.823]  It's happening, okay?
[01:13:00.262 --> 01:13:03.224]  Now, I am sick and tired of Tom Warner.
[01:13:03.304 --> 01:13:21.657]  Not only are they doing that, through the government, for about five years, and we've confirmed this all over the country, you can't go to Infowars.com, or PrisonPlanet.com, or PrisonPlanet.tv, or Infowars.net, at any library in this country.
[01:13:24.193 --> 01:13:26.934]  That has certain types of filtering software.
[01:13:27.134 --> 01:13:27.854]  There are some.
[01:13:28.434 --> 01:13:33.876]  But any place in the country that has this software, and that's the majority, these poor people buy it.
[01:13:33.916 --> 01:13:35.077]  They think it's a filter.
[01:13:35.797 --> 01:13:41.639]  The filter out terror, hate, porn, hacking, and gambling.
[01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:43.780]  We're listed in hate.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.140]  And you know what?
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:46.821]  I do hate you.
[01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:47.681]  It's true.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.020]  I hate pedophiles.
[01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:51.701]  I hate scammers.
[01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.482]  I hate the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:54.642 --> 01:13:56.223]  I hate these lying warmongers.
[01:13:56.903 --> 01:14:01.045]  I hate the Israeli government who radiated 100,000 Jewish children and killed them.
[01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:04.166]  I hate our government that gave black men syphilis.
[01:14:04.186 --> 01:14:05.767]  They didn't just not treat them for 50 years.
[01:14:06.047 --> 01:14:07.748]  Yeah, you bet I hate evil.
[01:14:08.408 --> 01:14:09.108]  I hate corruption.
[01:14:09.368 --> 01:14:11.749]  I hate the fact the dollar's been devalued by 45%.
[01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.771]  And I hate the fact the general public's so dumbed down they can't even comprehend what that means.
[01:14:16.951 --> 01:14:18.412]  But some Mexican immigrant can.
[01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.604]  A lot smarter than we are in many respects.
[01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:28.227]  I hate the fact that I'm not articulated, that I get so angry I can't even articulate how bad things have gotten.
[01:14:28.247 --> 01:14:29.928]  We're going to Paul Watson in a second.
[01:14:29.988 --> 01:14:31.149]  I'm sorry to have any hope, Paul.
[01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:35.751]  But I've got to say this, and Paul and I are going to write a big article about this.
[01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:38.332]  I have talked to probably eight different people.
[01:14:39.233 --> 01:14:42.675]  People I know personally, who worked at Dell Computers.
[01:14:42.795 --> 01:14:45.136]  And you're allowed to surf the internet on your breaks and at lunch.
[01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:57.387]  And if they visit Infowars.com, they are fired, they call them in, they show them the logs, and they go, you know your agreement here, the policy, you're not allowed to visit hate sites.
[01:14:58.107 --> 01:14:58.768]  Hate sites?
[01:14:58.848 --> 01:15:02.610]  It's Alex Jones, Best of Austin, TV and Radio.
[01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:05.311]  This is a guy that just posts bills on his website.
[01:15:06.972 --> 01:15:07.933]  Sorry, you're fired.
[01:15:08.693 --> 01:15:10.774]  And I've mentioned that, but I've never really gotten into it.
[01:15:11.155 --> 01:15:11.715]  Confirmed.
[01:15:12.415 --> 01:15:13.316]  Total censorship.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.385]  Remember how Dell wouldn't sell computers to a major gun manufacturer because they said it was hate?
[01:15:19.646 --> 01:15:21.568]  Remember all that big thing about two, three years ago?
[01:15:22.108 --> 01:15:23.530]  I mean, it's not just me, folks.
[01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:24.450]  It's gonna be everybody.
[01:15:27.613 --> 01:15:28.594]  I know, you're conservative.
[01:15:28.614 --> 01:15:29.295]  Turn the guns in.
[01:15:29.315 --> 01:15:29.796]  I understand.
[01:15:30.296 --> 01:15:34.280]  But, um... So all of this is going on and happening.
[01:15:34.801 --> 01:15:37.283]  Be sure and add that poll, by the way, how they went after gun makers.
[01:15:38.872 --> 01:15:43.839]  And then every week we can't get on our own websites because we've got Time Warner, Roadrunner, Cable.
[01:15:43.879 --> 01:15:45.561]  It is better than DSL in most cases.
[01:15:45.922 --> 01:15:46.763]  But I've got to get rid of it.
[01:15:48.105 --> 01:15:53.532]  And I'm sitting there and I can't get on my site because they block our DNS.
[01:15:55.089 --> 01:15:58.910]  And they block a bunch of other Patriot website DNS's, and I call them, complain, and they put it back on.
[01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:06.672]  Well now, nationwide and worldwide, all-time Warner Holdings have blocked InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:16:06.932 --> 01:16:14.234]  Our IT people have done the trace routes today, that's what's causing the problem, and they are doing a blackout on anybody that's got it.
[01:16:14.734 --> 01:16:17.196]  Everybody I know that doesn't have it can get it around the country.
[01:16:17.436 --> 01:16:18.396]  I've called New York.
[01:16:18.476 --> 01:16:19.317]  I've called Minnesota.
[01:16:19.357 --> 01:16:20.357]  I've called California.
[01:16:20.697 --> 01:16:22.018]  I've called people in Austin.
[01:16:22.438 --> 01:16:28.422]  If you've got Time Warner, any type of internet service, you can't go to presentplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[01:16:29.402 --> 01:16:32.724]  They just feel like you don't get to have that.
[01:16:34.785 --> 01:16:38.287]  And I'm sick of Dell computers and that smirking piece of trash.
[01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.809]  I'm sick of Time Warner.
[01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:43.290]  I'm sick of all of you.
[01:16:44.065 --> 01:16:45.125]  And let me tell you something.
[01:16:45.346 --> 01:16:46.646]  You're not going to stop us.
[01:16:47.086 --> 01:16:54.049]  People are going to go to InfoWars.com and they're going to read about how all the new keyboards have a tracker switch in them that reports everything back to the government.
[01:16:54.289 --> 01:16:57.710]  And they're going to learn how their cell phones track everything they do and even listen to them.
[01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:59.431]  And they're going to learn how OnStore does it.
[01:16:59.591 --> 01:17:02.912]  And they're going to learn that they're putting transponders in all the cars in Texas.
[01:17:03.092 --> 01:17:04.052]  And they're going to learn!
[01:17:04.072 --> 01:17:05.213]  And they're going to learn it all!
[01:17:05.373 --> 01:17:07.174]  And there's nothing you're going to do about it!
[01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:10.875]  Because the people have got a taste of the truth now.
[01:17:11.813 --> 01:17:18.419]  And it's gonna, so I want all of you to start websites and I want you to duplicate the headlines of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:18.579 --> 01:17:23.543]  We have a program where you can click on it and it'll upload our stories every day to your site in your format.
[01:17:23.683 --> 01:17:24.844]  I want you to clone.
[01:17:24.924 --> 01:17:26.706]  I want you to put your own information in.
[01:17:27.006 --> 01:17:28.107]  We're taking over!
[01:17:28.347 --> 01:17:29.789]  We're taking this country back!
[01:17:30.549 --> 01:17:33.272]  I'm launching two more websites on different servers.
[01:17:33.332 --> 01:17:33.832]  That's it!
[01:17:34.112 --> 01:17:37.175]  Every time they do stuff like this I increase our flotilla.
[01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:41.975]  Watson, I'm sorry you've been holding for 10 minutes while I've been ranting, but doesn't this make you mad, too?
[01:17:43.156 --> 01:17:50.083]  Well, it's amazing, you know, that O'Reilly can get on Fox News and call for assassinating Prime Ministers.
[01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:53.326]  Pat Robertson can do the same on the 700 Club.
[01:17:53.987 --> 01:17:57.450]  And yet, we get called hate sites.
[01:17:57.490 --> 01:18:02.275]  There's an article today out of Italy where the government, under new anti-terrorism
[01:18:03.558 --> 01:18:17.844]  Laws has ordered public libraries and internet cafes by law to install this tracking filtration software and to take passport photocopies of every customer who uses the internet.
[01:18:19.045 --> 01:18:21.046]  And the same thing just happened in Australia.
[01:18:21.686 --> 01:18:22.906]  It's happening, folks.
[01:18:23.887 --> 01:18:25.868]  So again, they're using that Chinese model.
[01:18:27.168 --> 01:18:28.989]  We're going under the Chinese model!
[01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:34.302]  I mean, stay there.
[01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.902]  We'll come back and talk about it.
[01:18:38.404 --> 01:18:39.484]  But you know what the good news is?
[01:18:39.524 --> 01:18:42.386]  They wouldn't be doing this if we weren't hurting them.
[01:18:42.406 --> 01:18:47.548]  So you tell everybody out there on the web, the most important, hottest thing out there is conspiracy.
[01:18:48.148 --> 01:18:48.929]  It's telling the truth.
[01:18:49.689 --> 01:18:51.250]  Go ahead and try to keep it from the people.
[01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:56.731]  Government of death which governs me.
[01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.612]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:18:59.053 --> 01:19:01.755]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:04.858]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:19:05.298 --> 01:19:11.764]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:19:12.084 --> 01:19:19.791]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.

[01:19:27.478 --> 01:19:32.002]  Get your stickers at LibertyStickers.com for your family, friends, and community.
[01:19:32.603 --> 01:19:34.024]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:19:34.224 --> 01:19:34.564]  Have you?
[01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:36.666]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:39.028]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:19:39.048 --> 01:19:40.930]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:19:45.294 --> 01:19:46.376]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[01:19:46.896 --> 01:19:48.098]  Osama Bin Forgotten?
[01:19:48.538 --> 01:19:52.163]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today!
[01:19:54.181 --> 01:19:55.822]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:55.942 --> 01:20:00.044]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:00.185 --> 01:20:03.066]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:09.870]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:13.052]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:13.252 --> 01:20:15.634]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:17.975]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[01:20:18.095 --> 01:20:18.615]  We're good to go!
[01:20:45.491 --> 01:20:56.820]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:02.684]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:03.264 --> 01:21:03.765]  That's right.
[01:21:04.085 --> 01:21:06.366]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:13.852]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:14.392 --> 01:21:22.094]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:22.535 --> 01:21:27.396]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:31.037]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:33.818 --> 01:21:37.960]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:38.621]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:38.641 --> 01:21:40.522]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:40.602 --> 01:21:40.902]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.922 --> 01:21:41.482]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:57.066]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:02.469]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:03.970]  But now, we don't have to.
[01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:12.434]  This sacro wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[01:22:12.754 --> 01:22:16.776]  Simply lie on your back with the sacro wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[01:22:17.036 --> 01:22:19.797]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[01:22:20.217 --> 01:22:23.719]  Use the sacro wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:27.801]  Get your Sacro wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:29.461]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:22:30.582 --> 01:22:37.345]  That's 877-817-9829 and ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[01:22:37.725 --> 01:22:40.046]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[01:22:40.366 --> 01:22:43.667]  Get your Sacro wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.
[01:22:43.968 --> 01:22:44.188]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:45.448]  That's 877-817-9829 and give yourself a wedgie.
[01:22:54.537 --> 01:22:57.279]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.299 --> 01:23:01.203]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:07.428]  By the way, this just in.
[01:23:07.968 --> 01:23:09.289]  From the network.
[01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:15.835]  Everybody using AOL couldn't get to GCNlive.com on our site, but could get to all the other sites, see?
[01:23:17.387 --> 01:23:26.249]  Sometime last night, in the early morning hours, they loaded new filtration systems into their systems, into their servers.
[01:23:27.449 --> 01:23:29.250]  And this has been an ongoing problem.
[01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:36.372]  And I tell you, look, you don't get our websites, and you got Time Warner, do not wait, do not procrastinate.
[01:23:36.412 --> 01:23:38.772]  You call them up, and you say, you listen to me.
[01:23:39.592 --> 01:23:46.834]  If that isn't fixed in a day, and if this keeps happening, we're leaving your service, and don't worry, you can get other... Like, what's my problem?
[01:23:47.597 --> 01:23:49.478]  There's a local cable modem company.
[01:23:49.598 --> 01:23:50.218]  Oh, that's right.
[01:23:50.539 --> 01:23:53.060]  When I check with them, they buy it from Time Warner.
[01:23:54.361 --> 01:23:55.621]  Well, I'll get Grande then.
[01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:56.622]  Listen.
[01:23:57.082 --> 01:23:58.783]  In fact, I'm pledging it right now.
[01:23:58.823 --> 01:24:02.005]  Except in a way, I need to have it to know if they're doing it.
[01:24:02.025 --> 01:24:02.305]  You know what?
[01:24:02.325 --> 01:24:03.426]  I'll get two services.
[01:24:04.346 --> 01:24:05.387]  So I can monitor them.
[01:24:07.768 --> 01:24:15.332]  I'll get the Cox or whatever it is and then also get a Time Warner or Grande and Time Warner.
[01:24:16.827 --> 01:24:19.068]  And just, look, don't buy a Dell computer.
[01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.709]  They lost big business with their anti-gun behavior.
[01:24:22.809 --> 01:24:26.810]  Oh, sorry, we can't sell you a computer because it says here that you're a gun company.
[01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:28.111]  Remember that?
[01:24:28.131 --> 01:24:32.892]  I mean, this is how extreme Michael Dell, the big Bush supporter is.
[01:24:33.272 --> 01:24:34.533]  Oh yeah, he knows who to support.
[01:24:34.873 --> 01:24:35.953]  Let's go back to Paul Watson.
[01:24:35.973 --> 01:24:41.555]  Paul, I'm sorry I'm ranting about this, but in this country, I think about 10% of people got Time Warner.
[01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:47.091]  I mean, I know it's a large percentage of people, and I'm tired of them not being able to get to our websites, Paul.
[01:24:48.512 --> 01:24:51.092]  Well, yeah, the only answer is to make a big stink out of it.
[01:24:51.672 --> 01:25:03.916]  I know several of the big technology websites usually carry censorship stories like this, so we'll write a big article, send it out, and, you know, they'll be damaged in the long term more than we will.
[01:25:04.116 --> 01:25:05.616]  So it's a mistake on their part.
[01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:12.333]  Well, we just want them to stop it and correct the, quote, problem.
[01:25:13.053 --> 01:25:20.536]  But, no, I've talked to literally hundreds of people who cannot go to our websites in the libraries.
[01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:22.737]  And I've experienced it here in Austin.
[01:25:23.737 --> 01:25:29.440]  Paul, you've done articles before about people in England with the biggest internet service provider can't get to our websites.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:37.203]  Yeah, I mean, I get an email every week saying that it's blocked in libraries because of it being a hate site.
[01:25:37.927 --> 01:25:49.853]  I'm looking at the website now, you know, BBC, Financial Times, Christian Science Monitor, Charlotte Observer, AFP, Associated Press, it's all really hateful.
[01:25:52.214 --> 01:25:56.116]  Well, what's hateful is, is that we connect the dots and show people the big picture.
[01:25:56.156 --> 01:26:00.118]  I mean, I get on the air and I go, look, CNN says Bush wants martial law.
[01:26:00.378 --> 01:26:01.679]  Do you want martial law?
[01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:03.380]  Here's what martial law is.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.581]  Well, yeah, it just shows, you know, we're taking flight, so we're having an effect.
[01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:23.884]  We got called, or you directly got called anti-Semitic by the Jewish Review two days ago because you had George Galloway on your show who said the Zionists were in bed with Hitler, which is a historical fact.
[01:26:24.184 --> 01:26:29.945]  But there was a rash of articles in Jewish newspapers bashing both you and Galloway as anti-Semitic.
[01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:36.993]  I knew it was in that Neocon newspaper, but I didn't know the Jewish Review did that.
[01:26:37.533 --> 01:26:38.653]  Yeah, they had an article on it.
[01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:40.354]  It was on their website two days ago.
[01:26:40.534 --> 01:26:41.295]  What did they say?
[01:26:42.815 --> 01:26:54.081]  They said that your show was renowned for extremism and anti-Semitism, and then went on to try and disprove Galloway's claims that the Zionists were in bed with Hitler.
[01:26:55.501 --> 01:26:59.203]  Because I'm against the white supremacists.
[01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:00.542]  I love it, man.
[01:27:00.562 --> 01:27:03.644]  I got the Jewish Review attacking me and the White Supremacists don't like me either.
[01:27:05.745 --> 01:27:12.691]  I wonder what... It must really upset them that I've been on the air lately talking about how they microwaved all those little kids.
[01:27:15.993 --> 01:27:21.377]  I guess it's... So I would not be anti-Semitic if I wasn't for microwaving Jewish children?
[01:27:23.999 --> 01:27:27.382]  Any criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic.
[01:27:29.725 --> 01:27:32.447]  Even though the ADL gives awards to Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:27:32.988 --> 01:27:34.529]  Who openly says he admires Hitler.
[01:27:34.829 --> 01:27:35.049]  Yep.
[01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:36.430]  That's how it works.
[01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:38.852]  That's the problem, see, we don't admire Hitler, Paul.
[01:27:39.373 --> 01:27:39.593]  Yep.
[01:27:41.174 --> 01:27:44.937]  Basically, we don't admire the establishment, whatever establishment that is.
[01:27:45.257 --> 01:27:46.938]  What exactly did the Jewish Review say?
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.521]  Well, I can pull up the article and read it if you want.
[01:27:50.601 --> 01:27:54.004]  It was yesterday, in fact, posted under commentary.
[01:27:55.117 --> 01:28:14.504]  There was an article by Kurt Nemo, a commentary article on it, and linked from that article is the blog from Moonbat, which is the name of the blog website, and then this from the Jewish Review, Galloway Blast Israel.
[01:28:15.644 --> 01:28:18.365]  And so there's another link in the article of the Jewish Review?
[01:28:18.645 --> 01:28:19.365]  That's right, yeah.
[01:28:21.346 --> 01:28:24.467]  Well, it doesn't work anymore, it's just they've lost all credibility.
[01:28:26.577 --> 01:28:27.398]  That's just sick.
[01:28:28.398 --> 01:28:29.739]  Hey, I stand guilty, folks.
[01:28:29.819 --> 01:28:38.364]  I've been on air saying it was wrong for Israel to radiate 100,000 Jewish children, and it was in the Jerusalem Post, so I guess they're anti-Semitic too, folks.
[01:28:38.384 --> 01:28:40.726]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.248 --> 01:28:45.168]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:47.250]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:50.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.463 --> 01:29:00.827]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.047 --> 01:29:06.049]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:14.314]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.454 --> 01:29:21.498]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.698 --> 01:29:22.919]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:23.059 --> 01:29:26.461]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:27.641]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.922 --> 01:29:29.202]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:29.402 --> 01:29:36.226]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:36.346 --> 01:29:38.808]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:29:41.932 --> 01:29:41.972]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.992 --> 01:29:42.934]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.761]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.841 --> 01:30:06.565]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.925 --> 01:30:11.447]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.527 --> 01:30:22.851]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:30.294]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.694 --> 01:30:32.814]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.315 --> 01:30:38.296]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:30:38.596 --> 01:30:44.739]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:55.642]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:30:55.822 --> 01:30:56.962]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:30:57.122 --> 01:31:00.544]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:00.644 --> 01:31:01.084]  Phenol!
[01:31:01.384 --> 01:31:08.446]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:31:08.806 --> 01:31:12.910]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.471]  Fragrance?
[01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:18.596]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:18.736 --> 01:31:23.420]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.143]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:31:26.443 --> 01:31:29.866]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:31:30.006 --> 01:31:33.589]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:36.132]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:31:36.292 --> 01:31:37.173]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:31:58.852 --> 01:32:05.537]  Criticism really doesn't bother me.
[01:32:05.657 --> 01:32:12.162]  I mean, there have been Washington Post articles attacking me that I haven't even read on air.
[01:32:13.083 --> 01:32:16.145]  And it's gotten to the point now where I see news articles attacking me most of the time.
[01:32:16.165 --> 01:32:19.827]  I'll read like half of it and don't even... because I'm not really into myself.
[01:32:20.028 --> 01:32:23.270]  But when it starts attacking free speech, it becomes a problem.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:32.983]  And I have read the Kurt Niemann article, and I have read some of the blog against me, connected to David Horowitz's little neocon group.
[01:32:33.684 --> 01:32:35.944]  But I haven't read the Jewish Review and all that.
[01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:37.265]  Those are big publications.
[01:32:37.305 --> 01:32:39.746]  And then one of our Jewish friends over in London
[01:32:40.922 --> 01:33:06.378]  Simon Ranowitz, who we had dinner with when I was in London, he gets that local British Jewish review, and man, there was the same hit piece on me last week, and then now Time Warner is blocking me out nationwide to anybody, because I had George Galloway, a Liberal Member of Parliament, who's well known for being a touchy-feely on all the race stuff, and we talk about stuff in the Jerusalem Post,
[01:33:07.108 --> 01:33:10.890]  In Herat, where Israel's been caught carrying out terror attacks to blame it on its enemies.
[01:33:11.691 --> 01:33:19.595]  And then, so one of these guys uses the headline, Alex Jones, a fan of every anti-Semitic lie known to man.
[01:33:20.056 --> 01:33:27.340]  I mean, I could clearly take that guy to court, have a two-year battle, spend a bunch of money, get a judgment, and of course I wouldn't pay.
[01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:33.403]  And, uh, it's like an ocean of people to go after now.
[01:33:35.164 --> 01:33:36.205]  I don't know, I'm tempted.
[01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:50.337]  These guys have been losing a lot of lawsuits lately because they really will just put these labels on people that... I mean, my long history of standing up against all these racist groups, I mean, I have a right to say I'm against Israel's policy.
[01:33:51.277 --> 01:33:53.578]  And I've been criticized for not bashing Israel.
[01:33:53.618 --> 01:33:54.839]  It's insane!
[01:33:55.459 --> 01:33:59.081]  But you notice the people attacking me, they don't attack the white supremacists.
[01:33:59.101 --> 01:34:01.302]  Because they like the white supremacists.
[01:34:01.322 --> 01:34:06.825]  Because they say outlandish, stupid things that make anybody who's against what Israel's doing look like a fool.
[01:34:08.382 --> 01:34:18.147]  See, the white supremacists are the brush they paint us with, because we're against the irradiation of 100,000 Jewish children.
[01:34:18.167 --> 01:34:35.895]  We think murdering those children was wrong, and so we're anti-Semitic, and we think Arnold saying that he wants to be worshipped at Nuremberg like Hitler, and handing out Hitler records, and saying he admires Hitler publicly, and wants to be ruler of the world publicly, is bad, but see, that's why he gets all the big Simon Wiesenthal awards.
[01:34:36.966 --> 01:34:39.207]  Because we fight Nazis, we are Nazis.
[01:34:41.368 --> 01:34:42.268]  That should be the headline.
[01:34:42.308 --> 01:34:44.249]  Because we fight Nazis, we are Nazis.
[01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:46.970]  The best thing to do, I think, is ignore it.
[01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:48.790]  These people have lost all credibility.
[01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:49.831]  You know how you answer it?
[01:34:50.351 --> 01:35:02.255]  You go to every blog you can, you go to every message board you can, you send out emails to your email list, and you tell them to go to InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com, and you tell everybody to get off Time Warner.
[01:35:04.051 --> 01:35:13.160]  Now, the problem is these big globalists are buying up all the hubs, so even if you're a service provider, you're literally going to be buying your bandwidth from people like them to begin with.
[01:35:14.162 --> 01:35:18.666]  Then we'll have to have alternative networks, and it's going to be tough to get your info in the future.
[01:35:18.686 --> 01:35:19.847]  I mean, it's really starting.
[01:35:20.908 --> 01:35:25.213]  And this has been going on for a while, and we haven't really talked about it much because we're so focused on other issues.
[01:35:25.962 --> 01:35:41.311]  But, um, because we expose the Nazi death cults, allied with the Zionist death cults, because we expose the British Royal death cults, because we expose the globalist master plan, because we talk about the dollar being worthless and all of this, they're very upset right now.
[01:35:42.031 --> 01:35:42.972]  Because we're hurting them.
[01:35:43.072 --> 01:35:44.653]  And we're going to go on hurting them, aren't we, Paul?
[01:35:45.993 --> 01:35:46.554]  Well, that's right.
[01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:49.355]  I mean, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then you win.
[01:35:49.575 --> 01:35:50.616]  They attack you, then you win.
[01:35:51.452 --> 01:36:03.742]  Um, they forwarded Galloway's comments, the Jewish Review, to Downing Street, according to this article, who said it had no intention of validating these well-known views of George Galloway with any comments.
[01:36:04.443 --> 01:36:07.065]  So now Downing Street's involved with it as well.
[01:36:07.105 --> 01:36:08.606]  No, we have to... I didn't know that.
[01:36:08.686 --> 01:36:14.871]  Oh, there's reports to the... Tony Blair is overseeing on what we've said.
[01:36:14.991 --> 01:36:16.753]  Oh, we're evil, Paul.
[01:36:19.162 --> 01:36:25.248]  I mean, how dare Galloway and I mention the Jerusalem Post admitting Israel carries out bombings to blame it on people?
[01:36:25.908 --> 01:36:27.009]  How dare us, Paul?
[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:28.110]  Exactly.
[01:36:28.571 --> 01:36:32.815]  Galloway said he stood by all of his comments, so he's not backing down in any way.
[01:36:32.835 --> 01:36:35.978]  And I mean, it shows their frustration.
[01:36:36.018 --> 01:36:41.683]  Again, you have reports out of Capitol Hill Blue who have inside links to all these White House sources.
[01:36:42.495 --> 01:36:49.079]  Saying that Bush and his staffers are walking around swearing and screaming at everyone, and are basically going insane.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.161]  Sounds like me!
[01:36:51.881 --> 01:36:55.083]  Yeah, and then they come out with quotes about creating their own reality.
[01:36:55.664 --> 01:37:00.186]  You know, like painting a picture that New Orleans is all Palm Beach and hammocks.
[01:37:00.687 --> 01:37:03.188]  So, I mean, they're the ones on the edge of sanity.
[01:37:04.089 --> 01:37:05.730]  I think everybody's going crazy.
[01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:08.612]  I'm not running around cursing folks, but I am running around yelling.
[01:37:09.312 --> 01:37:11.774]  It's just because they know stuff, the time is short.
[01:37:12.432 --> 01:37:18.557]  Listen, they gotta do everything, they're trying to carry out this operation of gutting America, and it's not going well.
[01:37:19.878 --> 01:37:24.242]  But at the same time, even though it's not going well, it's still very distressing to me to watch it happening.
[01:37:24.882 --> 01:37:35.791]  But, I mean, how can they link to our comments, Paul, where we're going, oh, it's just terrible how Israel killed Jews to blame it on people, and then it's admitted in Israel, but we're still bad?
[01:37:37.433 --> 01:37:41.276]  Because any criticism of the government of Israel is racist.
[01:37:45.302 --> 01:37:46.943]  But everybody knows that's stupid.
[01:37:48.044 --> 01:37:51.326]  Exactly, and so do they, but it's the way of shutting down free speech.
[01:37:51.686 --> 01:37:53.107]  They're not going to admit the truth.
[01:37:53.607 --> 01:37:57.290]  Yeah, under this hate crimes bill if it passes, folks, they'll come arrest me.
[01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:01.852]  I mean, I go, look, Harat says they have fake al-Qaeda groups bombing.
[01:38:02.493 --> 01:38:05.355]  Oh, Alex Jones went to jail, he's mad.
[01:38:06.976 --> 01:38:08.136]  We're not joking, by the way.
[01:38:09.877 --> 01:38:12.499]  They're already arresting Christians who kneel and pray on the street corner.
[01:38:15.023 --> 01:38:15.984]  I don't know what to do anymore.
[01:38:16.004 --> 01:38:18.586]  They arrested a lady in New London, Connecticut for going into the meeting.
[01:38:18.646 --> 01:38:22.129]  I mean, she's been held for 16 days now.
[01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:23.210]  15 days, Paul.
[01:38:23.951 --> 01:38:33.399]  Well, yeah, here in Britain they drug out and arrested an 82-year-old pensioner for heckling Jack Straw, the British Foreign Minister.
[01:38:33.939 --> 01:38:35.581]  And he was a Labour Party member.
[01:38:35.601 --> 01:38:41.706]  He was at the conference and they stopped him from going back into the conference under anti-terrorism laws.
[01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:52.946]  I've got articles here where in Australia they're saying no due process, no rights, they're just arresting bloggers, mainstream media, they're running around foaming at the mouth.
[01:38:53.266 --> 01:38:54.968]  Paul, I think it's starting right now!
[01:38:56.189 --> 01:39:05.898]  Well exactly, and I mean what they're going to do with these different security gradings, permissions, and what the government will allow you to do under your national ID card, IBM
[01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:18.769]  I've rolled out fingerprint scanning keyboards and obviously that level of permission on what you're allowed to do if you're allowed to access the internet at all will be built into those fingerprint scanners.
[01:39:20.518 --> 01:39:23.119]  There's stuff posted on our site right now they do not like.
[01:39:23.139 --> 01:39:34.225]  Like all the new keyboards have a keyboard recording device in them that then transmits through the internet by itself without you giving permission to the police every keystroke you're making.
[01:39:34.245 --> 01:39:37.386]  So, I mean, they just can't stand what we're doing, Paul.
[01:39:39.047 --> 01:39:39.627]  Well, exactly.
[01:39:39.647 --> 01:39:41.148]  But as you said, it's not working.
[01:39:41.668 --> 01:39:42.869]  The point in the case is
[01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:58.910]  They're having to shift the justification for martial law from terrorism to natural disasters, which is what Bush's spontaneous, if you believe that, or Bush press conference's ever spontaneous, was all about yesterday.
[01:39:58.930 --> 01:40:06.914]  It wasn't about Myers, because two minutes after it finished there were 200 Associated Press articles on every different website.
[01:40:08.388 --> 01:40:12.052]  Selling Bush's bird flu martial law plan.
[01:40:12.392 --> 01:40:21.161]  And they've got so few people to go protest for Bush at pro-war rallies that Jeff Gannon's running around now, Bush's boyfriend, leading these things.
[01:40:22.482 --> 01:40:32.752]  Well yeah, it was, while it was going on in Washington D.C., tens of thousands of people at least, there was a pro-war protest where a hundred people attended.
[01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:40.497]  So, again, this kind of 50-50 split on pro-war, anti-war, I don't believe it for a second.
[01:40:40.517 --> 01:40:46.183]  Well, I'll tell you, I want to go to some calls, Paul, but we're living in the twilight zone.
[01:40:46.343 --> 01:40:47.144]  I mean, we really are.
[01:40:47.164 --> 01:40:49.106]  Well, it's 2005.
[01:40:51.391 --> 01:40:55.194]  You know, that must have hurt them, though, to have Galloway on.
[01:40:55.214 --> 01:40:57.035]  You've got to repost Galloway's comments.
[01:40:57.055 --> 01:40:58.956]  You've got to repost Meacher's comments, by the way.
[01:40:59.256 --> 01:41:02.599]  Remember when we had Meacher on and he said all that stuff about government-sponsored terror?
[01:41:03.199 --> 01:41:04.860]  And then now he's written a big article about it?
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:07.722]  Well, I mean, we need to get those two articles together.
[01:41:07.742 --> 01:41:10.164]  I mean, I guess Meacher's bad now, too, right?
[01:41:11.428 --> 01:41:15.749]  Well, I mean, when a bunch of people on internet forums are saying it, they can laugh it off, it's nothing.
[01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:22.691]  But when members of Parliament are saying the same thing, it gets to be a problem, and they have to respond, which they are now doing.
[01:41:23.432 --> 01:41:25.052]  But it only helps us in the long run.
[01:41:25.772 --> 01:41:27.173]  Our credibility's being enhanced.
[01:41:27.893 --> 01:41:33.535]  Prisonplanet.com on many days, you know, gets more hits than the Britney Spears website.
[01:41:34.115 --> 01:41:36.575]  We're up above Rush Limbaugh on some days.
[01:41:36.595 --> 01:41:38.376]  I mean, that's got to be hurting them.
[01:41:41.013 --> 01:41:43.755]  Yeah, I can feel their eyes on me right now.
[01:41:44.356 --> 01:41:47.958]  It's like Lord of the Rings, the guy of Sauron.
[01:41:47.998 --> 01:41:48.859]  Looking down on me.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.022]  The old pyramid up there, the old eyeball.
[01:41:53.543 --> 01:41:54.824]  You know what?
[01:41:55.024 --> 01:41:56.925]  We must be hurting them when they're doing all this, Paul.
[01:41:58.066 --> 01:42:00.028]  Well, I mean, London bombings.
[01:42:00.048 --> 01:42:01.409]  I don't know if it's the case now.
[01:42:02.029 --> 01:42:03.670]  You know, major historical event.
[01:42:03.731 --> 01:42:08.214]  Typed in London bombings into Google, certainly a couple of weeks after it happened.
[01:42:08.254 --> 01:42:10.776]  First link was our website.
[01:42:14.326 --> 01:42:15.947]  Yeah, that's really freaking them out.
[01:42:16.467 --> 01:42:20.550]  Well, I mean, what are we going to do, though, if they're already doing it, where people can't get to the sites?
[01:42:20.610 --> 01:42:21.591]  That's just too bad.
[01:42:23.552 --> 01:42:29.476]  Well, we just counter-attack, make a big stink out of it, and as in the past, they will back down.
[01:42:29.516 --> 01:42:31.417]  It will come to a point where they won't back down.
[01:42:31.437 --> 01:42:33.118]  Well, you know, it's not like we're just Internet, too.
[01:42:33.158 --> 01:42:39.242]  We're AM, FM, satellite, shortwave, and videos and tapes that go out, hard copies.
[01:42:39.262 --> 01:42:41.544]  That's why hard copies are so important.
[01:42:43.007 --> 01:42:52.949]  So we have a multi-variant, in fact, I want everybody out there who's bought my videos, who hasn't made copies, make a DVD copy, make a VHS copy, make one every night when you go to bed.
[01:42:53.289 --> 01:42:59.770]  Do it neurotically, religiously, pathologically, obsessive-compulsively, do not stop.
[01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:03.631]  Make a hundred copies in the next hundred days and give them to people.
[01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:05.671]  That's how we'll deal with this, right Paul?
[01:43:06.771 --> 01:43:11.572]  Exactly, like you say, when you get attacked you just increase the workload, increase the attack arm.
[01:43:12.765 --> 01:43:15.105]  And in the long run, they're gonna suffer for it.
[01:43:15.305 --> 01:43:15.986]  No, that's the real.
[01:43:16.006 --> 01:43:19.346]  We have to increase... We have to increase our counter-offensives.
[01:43:20.746 --> 01:43:24.227]  The only answer to these attacks is to increase firepower!
[01:43:24.907 --> 01:43:26.687]  The only way to do that is by you, the listeners.
[01:43:26.788 --> 01:43:34.169]  Literally, all of us are... It's like we're millions of guns aimed at their flagships, and if we all fire together, we can incinerate them.
[01:43:35.749 --> 01:43:37.749]  So I want everybody right now to just fire!
[01:43:37.849 --> 01:43:38.270]  Fire!
[01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.810]  Fire!
[01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:39.310]  Fire!
[01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.750]  Fire!
[01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:40.810]  Never stop firing!
[01:43:44.881 --> 01:43:45.921]  I'm just sick of it, though.
[01:43:47.282 --> 01:43:50.642]  Do you think the readers of all those neocon sites actually believe that dribble?
[01:43:52.103 --> 01:43:53.283]  Well, their ego believes it.
[01:43:53.323 --> 01:43:56.604]  I mean, the person's conscience is separate from their ego.
[01:43:56.644 --> 01:44:09.947]  That kind of stuff bulks up their ego, makes them feel part of a scene, which is what people like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh are, just part of a process of pumping up people's ego, making them feel part of the establishment.
[01:44:10.347 --> 01:44:11.948]  So their ego buys into it.
[01:44:11.968 --> 01:44:13.108]  I don't think their conscience would.
[01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:24.348]  Well, I don't know how anybody could manufacture the fraud that, you know, that we're anti-Jew.
[01:44:25.456 --> 01:44:27.537]  I mean, but again, Paul, it doesn't work anymore.
[01:44:27.557 --> 01:44:32.099]  It's like when I caught the black guys getting bribed for giving their false testimony.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:37.502]  The State House admitted in 2000, when it happened, that it was illegal.
[01:44:37.982 --> 01:44:40.103]  But then the paper just said, is Alex Jones racist?
[01:44:40.143 --> 01:44:40.943]  These men are black.
[01:44:40.983 --> 01:44:44.245]  I mean, it's a politically correct mental illness.
[01:44:44.885 --> 01:44:52.589]  But see, conservatives won't listen to political correctness if it's about blacks or Hispanics or Asians, but they will if it's about Jews.
[01:44:53.569 --> 01:44:55.130]  Because that's a neocon specialty.
[01:44:58.169 --> 01:45:05.292]  Exactly, and you mentioned the case of the preachers going to jail for 47 years for reading Bible passages.
[01:45:06.873 --> 01:45:22.299]  I've got emails, you know, every time we highlight the focus of homosexual adoption, which Bush's great new conservative justice is for, 11 times more likely to abuse children from all the studies in the last few years.
[01:45:22.359 --> 01:45:26.461]  But when you post that, you're homophobic, you want to hurt gay people,
[01:45:27.893 --> 01:45:28.913]  I mean, that's what you get.
[01:45:29.433 --> 01:45:30.574]  But that's not true!
[01:45:32.334 --> 01:45:33.354]  Listen, folks.
[01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:37.795]  You're five times more likely in foster care to be abused, period.
[01:45:37.835 --> 01:45:41.696]  And the statistic you reported is multiple studies out there.
[01:45:42.797 --> 01:45:45.037]  And at the same time, folks, where do you think they're getting these kids?
[01:45:45.057 --> 01:45:46.798]  They're snatching them from other families.
[01:45:50.679 --> 01:45:51.059]  You know what?
[01:45:51.099 --> 01:45:53.059]  I'm not putting up with it, Paul.
[01:45:53.339 --> 01:45:56.060]  You know, we're hate mongers because we're against abortion, too, right?
[01:45:57.307 --> 01:45:57.407]  Yep.
[01:45:57.427 --> 01:46:00.670]  You know, these liberals tune in, they hear us bashing Bush, and they go, ooh!
[01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:02.912]  And then they hear us go, oh, by the way, we're against killing babies.
[01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:04.413]  Oh, well, I thought you were good.
[01:46:04.693 --> 01:46:05.814]  Hey, get it straight, folks.
[01:46:05.854 --> 01:46:06.875]  We're not left or right.
[01:46:07.075 --> 01:46:10.638]  We're pro-life, pro-truth, pro-humanity.
[01:46:11.278 --> 01:46:24.109]  And if they're microwaving 100,000 Jewish children with high-powered radiation in Israel, Paul, I want you to go get those documents out of Haratz, and those documents out of, it was also in Jerusalem Post, big write-ups about it.
[01:46:24.679 --> 01:46:32.821]  We've never done a story on that, about how they tell the kids that were going to the dentist, they kill them with radiation, they give them the dead bodies back to the parents, say they died accidentally.
[01:46:33.421 --> 01:46:36.561]  You know, I want to write an article about that and just mourn these children.
[01:46:37.322 --> 01:46:39.602]  And I'm sorry I don't want to kill Jews, okay?
[01:46:39.982 --> 01:46:42.923]  I know if I was an evil Zionist and wanted to support Hitler, I'd be okay.
[01:46:43.083 --> 01:46:43.583]  But I don't!
[01:46:43.763 --> 01:46:45.623]  I don't dislike Jews.
[01:46:45.683 --> 01:46:46.443]  I like Jews.
[01:46:46.743 --> 01:46:47.784]  We're trying to save them here.
[01:46:47.804 --> 01:46:50.704]  Paul, do you want to apologize for being against killing Jews?
[01:46:52.985 --> 01:46:54.285]  It is a twilight zone.
[01:46:55.314 --> 01:47:07.737]  You know, when Tammy Bruce, a socialist feminist, says that Bush is alienating conservatives and that his government is bigger than anything FDR ever imagined, that's the twilight zone.
[01:47:08.118 --> 01:47:15.960]  Conservatives remain so naive that Bush is supporting their agenda when he's supporting the agenda of the globalists, again with this latest appointment.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.821]  But if you talk bad about her, you're probably going to be anti-German.
[01:47:22.828 --> 01:47:23.348]  Exactly.
[01:47:23.368 --> 01:47:24.369]  Are you against Germans?
[01:47:25.130 --> 01:47:26.170]  Admires German?
[01:47:27.371 --> 01:47:27.991]  Probably, yeah.
[01:47:28.572 --> 01:47:30.133]  So you're against German people?
[01:47:30.753 --> 01:47:30.993]  Yeah.
[01:47:31.914 --> 01:47:33.235]  You just criticize a German.
[01:47:35.716 --> 01:47:39.519]  And don't ever criticize, uh... Well, I criticize Tony Blair.
[01:47:39.539 --> 01:47:41.220]  That means I hate you, Paul.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:46.043]  Alright, well... Sorry.
[01:47:46.863 --> 01:47:47.584]  We criticize
[01:47:48.291 --> 01:47:48.751]  China?
[01:47:49.251 --> 01:47:51.312]  For their forced abortion policies?
[01:47:51.352 --> 01:47:55.134]  Another abortion activist just got beaten to death in China?
[01:47:55.174 --> 01:47:57.195]  Does that mean we hate Chinese people?
[01:47:57.275 --> 01:47:57.555]  No!
[01:47:57.575 --> 01:47:59.216]  We're trying to help them.
[01:47:59.436 --> 01:48:03.157]  But that's been said though.
[01:48:03.177 --> 01:48:06.919]  We're trying to fight the government killing them and taking their organs, so we hate them, Paul.
[01:48:07.299 --> 01:48:09.100]  Yeah, that's the leap of logic.
[01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:11.340]  Mercury's good for you too, Paul.
[01:48:11.801 --> 01:48:14.682]  Alright, who's up next here?
[01:48:14.862 --> 01:48:15.442]  We'll take a call.
[01:48:15.482 --> 01:48:17.403]  I'm sorry, I'm out of control today.
[01:48:18.553 --> 01:48:19.474]  Leandro!
[01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:20.334]  Leandro!
[01:48:20.355 --> 01:48:21.936]  You're on the air from California!
[01:48:22.016 --> 01:48:22.957]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:48:23.317 --> 01:48:23.577]  Fine.
[01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:26.139]  I just wanted to say thank you for what you're doing out there.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:27.540]  I really appreciate it.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.281]  Well, we're trying.
[01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:29.802]  They may come arrest me soon, but you know.
[01:48:30.022 --> 01:48:31.263]  Well, you know, I couldn't break you out of jail.
[01:48:32.584 --> 01:48:33.585]  I'll be there to help you out.
[01:48:33.785 --> 01:48:38.209]  I just wanted to first talk, I don't know why I've been on the phone for two hours.
[01:48:38.269 --> 01:48:41.632]  The initial reason I wanted to talk to you is pretty much gone by now.
[01:48:41.672 --> 01:48:46.936]  I did wake up this morning to George Bush talking about martial law, so I woke up pissed off to begin with.
[01:48:47.628 --> 01:48:48.668]  I'm pretty angry myself.
[01:48:49.548 --> 01:48:55.050]  Now I'm even more angry that I can't access your website because I recently got Time Warner.
[01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:58.091]  I had a feeling that there was something going on.
[01:48:58.111 --> 01:49:01.271]  I know they have the Illuminati symbol and all that.
[01:49:01.912 --> 01:49:04.492]  So you're unable to get to my website?
[01:49:04.532 --> 01:49:05.612]  I'm unable to get to your website.
[01:49:05.632 --> 01:49:06.653]  I'm pretty pissed off about that.
[01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:11.234]  I'm definitely going to call Time Warner and Bright House Networks here locally and give them what I think.
[01:49:12.188 --> 01:49:13.629]  And hopefully, uh, they work it out.
[01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:15.969]  If not, I'll switch to a different, uh, different server.
[01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:19.070]  Well, yeah, what they do is... Yeah, no, now it's nationwide.
[01:49:19.090 --> 01:49:20.571]  They've been beta testing it locally.
[01:49:21.651 --> 01:49:24.112]  And, uh, no, millions of people can't get to the site right now.
[01:49:24.172 --> 01:49:26.473]  You ought to see the phone calls and emails we're getting.
[01:49:27.733 --> 01:49:29.974]  Tell you what, uh, anything else you want to answer?
[01:49:29.994 --> 01:49:30.234]  Yeah, I do.
[01:49:30.254 --> 01:49:32.015]  I want to talk some more, but I know you're going to break, right?
[01:49:32.075 --> 01:49:33.295]  Okay, we'll come back to you.
[01:49:34.216 --> 01:49:34.536]  Hey!
[01:49:35.396 --> 01:49:36.276]  How dare us!
[01:49:36.496 --> 01:49:40.518]  How dare you want to be able to get to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com!
[01:49:42.905 --> 01:49:47.870]  Being an American means not being able to look at websites and not having freedom.
[01:49:49.371 --> 01:49:51.573]  Black judges, thank the government for taking your eyes.
[01:49:51.593 --> 01:49:52.614]  Thank you, government.
[01:49:52.694 --> 01:49:53.114]  Thank you.
[01:49:55.197 --> 01:49:58.038]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:09.661]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:10.081 --> 01:50:14.242]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.482 --> 01:50:17.324]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.424 --> 01:50:22.088]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.288 --> 01:50:26.692]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.932 --> 01:50:34.158]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:11.304 --> 01:52:11.905]  I think so.
[01:52:31.766 --> 01:52:31.966]  I think so.
[01:53:00.658 --> 01:53:01.839]  Look, there's no debating this.
[01:53:01.939 --> 01:53:04.801]  Our IT people have already known about this problem.
[01:53:04.841 --> 01:53:06.261]  It's been ongoing for several years.
[01:53:06.722 --> 01:53:08.803]  Now it is every time a warning system in the country.
[01:53:09.203 --> 01:53:10.924]  The calls are just spilling in.
[01:53:11.244 --> 01:53:12.985]  People have been accessing the sites for years.
[01:53:13.185 --> 01:53:13.746]  All our sites.
[01:53:13.766 --> 01:53:16.547]  You can't get to any of them but InfoWars.net.
[01:53:17.988 --> 01:53:20.050]  And see, this is a taste of the future.
[01:53:21.691 --> 01:53:23.912]  This is a taste of the future, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:24.512 --> 01:53:25.793]  They do not like what we're doing.
[01:53:26.588 --> 01:53:28.369]  And we specifically know what they're doing.
[01:53:28.389 --> 01:53:29.690]  They just blocked their customers.
[01:53:29.710 --> 01:53:33.292]  There's a block in there from being able to go to our sites, because they're so stupid.
[01:53:33.312 --> 01:53:35.333]  They don't know about Infowars.net.
[01:53:36.374 --> 01:53:41.837]  But let our caller in California finish up, then we're going to go to Tom.
[01:53:42.117 --> 01:53:43.118]  Tom, finish up what you were saying.
[01:53:43.138 --> 01:53:43.458]  Go ahead.
[01:53:44.458 --> 01:53:44.879]  Oh, Leandro.
[01:53:45.659 --> 01:53:46.219]  Yes, Leandro.
[01:53:46.259 --> 01:53:46.640]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:50.502]  I just want to talk about, basically, I just wanted to get off the subject.
[01:53:50.542 --> 01:53:56.185]  I know everybody calls in and tells you about all the different things that are going on, like nuclear bombs being out.
[01:53:57.361 --> 01:54:04.485]  South Carolina and all that and I believe there are a lot of stuff going on and a lot of things happening out here and I think knowledge is worthless if there's no action.
[01:54:05.245 --> 01:54:19.053]  I believe that people need to step up to the plate and go to the local bookstores, study the Freemasons, study the Illuminati, research the roots of all this so they have a full grasp of what's going on and also clean up their act.
[01:54:19.113 --> 01:54:25.236]  I do agree with protesting and going out there but there's so many protesters protesting so many different things that everybody gets confused.
[01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:32.397]  So I think protesters need to fight the battle by using the same weapons the government uses, which is information, and it's what you're doing.
[01:54:32.887 --> 01:54:34.767]  I think we need to get as sophisticated as they got.
[01:54:35.187 --> 01:54:40.869]  Well, yeah, people will put all this energy into going and having a protest, which I'm not saying is bad, but that's old media.
[01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.229]  Yeah.
[01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:52.991]  And instead of putting up websites, getting their information out, going and personally lobbying at the statehouse, you know, grabbing the senator by the hand and shaking their hand and going, listen to me, you stop violating America.
[01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:55.912]  Listen, thanks for the call, I appreciate it, and you keep it up, my friend.
[01:54:57.555 --> 01:55:10.623]  Tom, in Kansas City, you called and talked to the local fools at Time Warner, well-meaning employees, I shouldn't be mean, and they didn't know what was going on, but they admit that it's down, so you're now going to call corporate.
[01:55:10.663 --> 01:55:11.763]  Tom, tell us what you're up to.
[01:55:12.324 --> 01:55:21.129]  Well, this morning I got up and I logged on, and I'm an eBay seller, so I mean, I logged on to my computer, got into my mail, got into FedEx, got into UPS, eBay, all that other stuff.
[01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:23.070]  Everything else is working, hunky-dory, A-OK.
[01:55:24.312 --> 01:55:28.655]  I started listening to your show and I wanted to just log on to Prison Planet TV.
[01:55:29.135 --> 01:55:29.655]  Got nothing.
[01:55:29.795 --> 01:55:32.477]  It kept coming up saying I was unable to resolve.
[01:55:33.331 --> 01:55:43.234]  So I figured, you know, maybe you guys were just down for maintenance or whatever, but then after hearing you sit there and say, yeah, you know, they're pulling something a little sheisty, I decided to give our local office a call.
[01:55:43.274 --> 01:55:54.957]  And basically, they were given the, you know, the basic script to read, oh, we're having, you know, technical problems and, you know, we're working on this and we're working on that, and yep, it's a problem here, it's a problem there.
[01:55:55.373 --> 01:55:58.755]  We're also having problems with, you know, other sites like Ameritrade, this and that.
[01:55:58.775 --> 01:56:00.736]  Well, I logged on to Ameritrade, there was no problem.
[01:56:01.097 --> 01:56:02.297]  That seemed to get up just fine.
[01:56:03.058 --> 01:56:05.059]  The only sites that seem to be affected are yours.
[01:56:05.099 --> 01:56:11.843]  I haven't checked GCN yet, but in the likelihood that that's, you know, being affected by their, you know, malicious intent is pretty high as well.
[01:56:11.863 --> 01:56:14.765]  We're able to get there, but listen, we've tracked it back directly.
[01:56:14.785 --> 01:56:15.746]  They're just blocking us.
[01:56:16.686 --> 01:56:19.448]  And we caught them for two years doing it in Austin.
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:24.122]  Well, what they told me is they were like, well, you know, it's a host problem.
[01:56:24.142 --> 01:56:26.463]  You're going to have to, you know, go back and check with you guys.
[01:56:26.903 --> 01:56:28.783]  And I, you know, fluffed it a little.
[01:56:28.823 --> 01:56:32.865]  I said, no, I've already been on the phone with them and they're saying that there's absolutely no problem with their servers.
[01:56:32.905 --> 01:56:37.127]  That, you know, that whatever it is, it's being filtered and it's being blocked on the Internet.
[01:56:37.327 --> 01:56:42.749]  No, it's only Time Warner and then it's public libraries that have filtering software.
[01:56:43.249 --> 01:56:46.310]  I mean, I urge everybody to call their local offices.
[01:56:46.371 --> 01:56:52.133]  Don't be rude, because like you said, you know, they're just people, the CSRs are just, the customer service reps are just people that are doing the 9 to 5.
[01:56:52.193 --> 01:57:00.317]  Look, tell them, tell them, we're blocked in libraries, we're blocked in Dell Computer, we're blocked at Time Warner, it's Globalist blocking us, it's Filters.
[01:57:00.657 --> 01:57:01.957]  We don't appreciate it.
[01:57:01.978 --> 01:57:02.638]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:02.658 --> 01:57:03.898]  I appreciate you doing that.
[01:57:03.938 --> 01:57:05.119]  Paul, comment on what he was saying.
[01:57:06.062 --> 01:57:07.763]  Well, it's truly the Chinese monologue.
[01:57:07.943 --> 01:57:11.285]  Associated Press yesterday, China shuts down websites in crackdown.
[01:57:11.666 --> 01:57:15.968]  China routinely shuts down or blocks websites that operate outside of government control.
[01:57:16.549 --> 01:57:26.175]  And what China did was burn down a bunch of internet cafes, blame it on extremists, and then they shut down all the internet cafes in the country.
[01:57:28.176 --> 01:57:29.517]  Stay with us, Paul.
[01:57:29.557 --> 01:57:30.938]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:57:33.775 --> 01:57:38.681]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:54.063]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.704 --> 01:57:55.504]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.265 --> 01:57:57.185]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.825 --> 01:58:01.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.028 --> 01:58:06.130]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.111 --> 01:58:13.554]  Alright, Russell, Moyne, Rodney, George, we're gonna get to you, I promise, quickly here.
[01:58:14.289 --> 01:58:17.331]  We can't get diverted completely off of the main subjects.
[01:58:17.812 --> 01:58:30.220]  Open discussions of martial law, open discussions of total police state in America, hate crimes laws for free speech, shut down basically any free speech the government doesn't like, and make you spend hard prison time for it.
[01:58:31.541 --> 01:58:32.502]  You name it, folks.
[01:58:32.982 --> 01:58:34.923]  It's all happening right now.
[01:58:35.003 --> 01:58:37.825]  Paul Watson riding a shotgun with us from PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:39.364 --> 01:58:49.649]  And if you're on Time Warner, or if you're an internet subscriber of a company, provider, that you subscribe from, buys bandwidth from them, you're not getting on anything.
[01:58:51.269 --> 01:58:52.010]  Any of our sites.
[01:58:53.670 --> 01:58:54.811]  They've been beta testing this.
[01:58:55.413 --> 01:58:59.835]  For a while in Austin, every other week you can't get on my sites through there, and they admit it's a DNS error.
[01:59:00.196 --> 01:59:08.020]  We've checked it all, our DNS is fine, works on every other server grid system but theirs, and now they've just shut us down nationwide.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:17.245]  And we want it fixed, we want it fixed now, so people can read Paul Watson's article, Bush Cites Military Takeover in Case of Flu Outbreak, where we give the analysis of what they're really doing.
[01:59:17.605 --> 01:59:19.426]  You think they like millions of people reading that?
[01:59:21.507 --> 01:59:24.709]  No, they panicked yesterday when we were getting about 4 million visitors.
[01:59:25.347 --> 01:59:27.108]  They're really starting to get freaked out.
[01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:30.031]  Syndicate our site, folks.
[01:59:30.131 --> 01:59:31.072]  Copy our stories.
[01:59:31.132 --> 01:59:32.093]  Put them on your sites.
[01:59:33.514 --> 01:59:35.675]  Believe me, nobody gets attacked like us.
[01:59:35.755 --> 01:59:37.337]  I mean, we hardly ever talk about it.
[01:59:37.497 --> 01:59:38.418]  The stuff we go through.
[01:59:38.758 --> 01:59:40.019]  Paul, they have no idea, do they?
[01:59:41.130 --> 01:59:48.434]  No, we get attacked by our own people on what we thought were our own people on a routine basis, so it's enough having to deal with that.
[01:59:48.454 --> 01:59:55.578]  We have to ignore it in most cases because the people doing it just want attention, but this is totally different, on a totally different level.
[01:59:56.079 --> 01:59:57.720]  Direct censorship attack.
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:03.543]  A whole bunch of newspapers in the last week simultaneously attacking us from the same script.
[02:00:05.234 --> 02:00:08.457]  It's called focused firepower, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:08.837 --> 02:00:13.260]  That's like an information warfare fleet movement where they just line up and are bombarding us.
[02:00:13.721 --> 02:00:14.661]  Which I think is great.
[02:00:15.602 --> 02:00:19.265]  Because we're the type of creature that just gets stronger when they do that, Paul.
[02:00:20.572 --> 02:00:28.953]  Well, in a way, it's a positive sign, because after every major event now, obviously we produce articles on it, telling people the real story.
[02:00:29.314 --> 02:00:32.594]  And in response to that, big newspapers always attack us.
[02:00:33.174 --> 02:00:38.295]  It happened after the London bombings, happened after the space disaster in 2002.
[02:00:38.415 --> 02:00:43.616]  Happens on 9-11, happens on Katrina, happens on everything.
[02:00:44.156 --> 02:00:45.476]  Yeah, popular mechanics.
[02:00:48.137 --> 02:00:49.277]  No, it's just...
[02:00:51.115 --> 02:00:53.237]  Vanity Fair, the list goes on and on.
[02:00:53.777 --> 02:00:54.678]  Try to list them all.
[02:00:55.438 --> 02:00:58.601]  So I guess, well then why do they attack us if it doesn't even work, Paul?
[02:00:58.641 --> 02:01:00.482]  I guess they just think they got big britches, no?
[02:01:01.903 --> 02:01:03.845]  Well yeah, I mean it's arrogance, basically.
[02:01:04.245 --> 02:01:13.312]  They don't realize that in attacking us, they give us credibility because people don't trust them anymore, which is why newspaper readership is down.
[02:01:13.512 --> 02:01:14.553]  Subscriptions are down.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:16.040]  That's right.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:16.981]  We tell it like it is.
[02:01:17.021 --> 02:01:18.101]  We let it all hang out.
[02:01:18.121 --> 02:01:19.482]  We don't care what people think of us.
[02:01:19.502 --> 02:01:21.303]  We're just going all the way, Paul.
[02:01:22.083 --> 02:01:22.544]  Exactly.
[02:01:22.824 --> 02:01:24.865]  We're going all the way to the end of the line.
[02:01:25.425 --> 02:01:28.106]  Let's go ahead and talk to Russell in Florida.
[02:01:28.126 --> 02:01:28.627]  Go ahead, Russell.
[02:01:28.667 --> 02:01:29.207]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:29.567 --> 02:01:30.148]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:01:30.188 --> 02:01:31.888]  Thanks, Paul, for being there.
[02:01:32.749 --> 02:01:35.130]  Alex, you're right on the money, as you always are.
[02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:38.812]  And Jesus said those that love Him would be hated.
[02:01:39.452 --> 02:01:40.353]  We'd be persecuted.
[02:01:40.993 --> 02:01:44.595]  And you know you're telling the truth when everybody in the world is attacking you.
[02:01:45.413 --> 02:01:47.253]  And that's what's been happening to you and others.
[02:01:48.154 --> 02:01:49.054]  And I think you're right.
[02:01:49.114 --> 02:01:50.774]  We have to mirror your information.
[02:01:50.814 --> 02:01:58.936]  What I do is I take all your news articles, the ones I think are really relevant to what's happening, and I send it out to all my email lists.
[02:01:59.216 --> 02:02:04.077]  And I'm going to create my own blog, like Kurt Nemo, because I have a lot of respect for him.
[02:02:04.797 --> 02:02:10.118]  And I'm going to start blogging, and I'm going to start analyzing myself and sending out articles that you promote.
[02:02:11.087 --> 02:02:12.188]  And do your own stuff.
[02:02:12.488 --> 02:02:15.751]  I'm just saying because they're really... This has been ongoing for a while.
[02:02:15.791 --> 02:02:16.712]  It's getting really bad.
[02:02:17.232 --> 02:02:18.353]  Well, why reinvent the wheel?
[02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:20.055]  You guys do such great analysis.
[02:02:20.215 --> 02:02:20.735]  But you're right.
[02:02:20.775 --> 02:02:23.237]  If you're down, then other people have to take the torch.
[02:02:23.778 --> 02:02:24.178]  Well, look.
[02:02:24.218 --> 02:02:31.284]  They could blow my head off tomorrow or throw some cocaine in my car tomorrow, so... We need more people to be doing what we're doing, okay?
[02:02:32.325 --> 02:02:33.106]  That's the answer.
[02:02:33.146 --> 02:02:34.187]  We gotta swarm them.
[02:02:34.247 --> 02:02:35.007]  Anything else, Russell?
[02:02:35.768 --> 02:02:36.829]  I wanted to mention something.
[02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:37.109]  Stay there.
[02:02:37.129 --> 02:02:38.450]  We'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:39.251]  Listen.
[02:02:39.927 --> 02:02:40.687]  Swarm them!
[02:02:41.108 --> 02:02:41.768]  Swarm them!
[02:02:41.968 --> 02:02:42.548]  Activate!
[02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:43.288]  Engage!
[02:02:43.449 --> 02:02:43.889]  Engage!
[02:02:44.009 --> 02:02:44.749]  Destroy!
[02:02:45.549 --> 02:02:49.911]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.091 --> 02:02:54.533]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.653 --> 02:02:59.015]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.075 --> 02:03:00.416]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.216 --> 02:03:02.157]  Panama!
[02:03:02.197 --> 02:03:06.420]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:13.426]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.546 --> 02:03:15.627]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.827 --> 02:03:26.356]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.556 --> 02:03:30.839]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind you, two-and-a-half-hour video police state
[02:03:30.879 --> 02:03:31.819]  We're good to go.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:47.962]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.282 --> 02:03:51.086]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.346 --> 02:03:55.491]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.932 --> 02:03:56.753]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.074 --> 02:04:01.640]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.241]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.741 --> 02:04:05.641]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:04:06.041 --> 02:04:09.762]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[02:04:10.062 --> 02:04:19.444]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.484 --> 02:04:19.864]  government.
[02:04:20.104 --> 02:04:26.526]  Gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:26.886 --> 02:04:31.288]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:31.728 --> 02:04:33.509]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.529 --> 02:04:33.749]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.829 --> 02:04:35.310]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:47.512 --> 02:04:49.014]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:04:49.174 --> 02:04:53.097]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:04:53.378 --> 02:05:00.704]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste bill, is something we all face every day.
[02:05:00.985 --> 02:05:02.906]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[02:05:03.207 --> 02:05:09.993]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:05:10.313 --> 02:05:13.176]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy tested.
[02:05:13.456 --> 02:05:18.902]  Your nuclear will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[02:05:19.182 --> 02:05:20.543]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:21.384 --> 02:05:26.089]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear today.
[02:05:26.389 --> 02:05:29.592]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:05:29.953 --> 02:05:34.477]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:05:34.737 --> 02:05:34.957]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:41.702]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[02:05:41.862 --> 02:05:42.323]  Nuke Alert.
[02:05:42.603 --> 02:05:43.663]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:05:46.565 --> 02:05:52.588]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:56.230]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.211 --> 02:06:00.392]  We've done two hours, eight minutes on this Wednesday edition.
[02:06:01.753 --> 02:06:03.074]  Paul Watson arrived to shotgun.
[02:06:04.941 --> 02:06:06.283]  We are going to news blurts here in a moment.
[02:06:06.303 --> 02:06:12.530]  I want to get to these calls, but notice in the last two and a half hours, two hours and eight minutes, I have not plugged any of my videos.
[02:06:13.906 --> 02:06:14.986]  I have not told you how to get them.
[02:06:15.026 --> 02:06:15.767]  I have not promoted them.
[02:06:15.807 --> 02:06:18.087]  I've just said, please, if you've got them, make copies.
[02:06:18.288 --> 02:06:19.588]  I need to plug them more.
[02:06:19.928 --> 02:06:37.354]  We need to talk about them, because it's something, if they take the net down tomorrow, which they just type in the Internet is dead, and they're openly not fixing the hubs, they're going to let the old Internet die, and then make you go on Internet 2, where there's no free speech, and then you have subdomains with one of 25 universities or private corporations.
[02:06:38.274 --> 02:06:40.715]  And then, oh yeah, you've got free speech, but just not on our Internet 2.
[02:06:41.575 --> 02:06:43.276]  Add that into there, too, Paul, and write an article.
[02:06:46.084 --> 02:06:51.445]  And so, good old-fashioned DVD and VHS just making a copy every night and giving it to somebody.
[02:06:51.505 --> 02:06:52.565]  Incredibly powerful.
[02:06:54.145 --> 02:06:58.766]  Micro-FMs are our AM and FM commercial stations out there that we're getting more and more affiliates.
[02:06:58.806 --> 02:07:00.327]  Thank God for those affiliates.
[02:07:00.607 --> 02:07:01.687]  I want to thank them!
[02:07:01.967 --> 02:07:03.307]  We're trying to save this country.
[02:07:03.347 --> 02:07:03.927]  They know it.
[02:07:04.207 --> 02:07:05.107]  We're telling the truth.
[02:07:05.147 --> 02:07:08.408]  I'm sorry it's scary, but who can deny we're living in tyranny now?
[02:07:09.828 --> 02:07:12.029]  CNN headline, Bush wants martial law.
[02:07:12.269 --> 02:07:13.329]  I mean, that's what it is!
[02:07:17.737 --> 02:07:20.379]  So get the videos, listen, and now is the time.
[02:07:21.199 --> 02:07:27.944]  Call up and say, I want Road to Tyranny, I want Masters of Terror, I want American Dictators, I want Martial Law, I want them.
[02:07:28.104 --> 02:07:28.564]  Get them.
[02:07:29.124 --> 02:07:31.626]  Cram them in your DVD, cram them in your VHS.
[02:07:32.346 --> 02:07:33.127]  Make copies.
[02:07:34.528 --> 02:07:35.348]  Give them to people.
[02:07:35.428 --> 02:07:36.749]  Say, watch this, it's important.
[02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:42.110]  It's so important, folks.
[02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:43.451]  We're unlocking mines.
[02:07:43.491 --> 02:07:44.831]  We're fighting for this country.
[02:07:45.231 --> 02:07:46.811]  We're counter-revolutionaries.
[02:07:46.891 --> 02:07:47.711]  Restorationists.
[02:07:47.952 --> 02:07:49.352]  The globalists are the revolutionaries.
[02:07:49.392 --> 02:07:50.712]  They've seized the government.
[02:07:50.752 --> 02:07:51.792]  They've got the corporations.
[02:07:51.812 --> 02:07:52.893]  They've taken over the media.
[02:07:53.293 --> 02:07:56.993]  People are fighting back now, and they don't like it because we're starting to clean their clocks!
[02:07:58.874 --> 02:08:00.634]  We've got a chance to beat these people.
[02:08:00.674 --> 02:08:01.914]  We've got a chance to rout them!
[02:08:03.295 --> 02:08:04.235]  And we're gonna do it!
[02:08:05.475 --> 02:08:06.275]  With God's help!
[02:08:07.956 --> 02:08:10.036]  But you have to engage the enemy.
[02:08:10.814 --> 02:08:12.656]  At point-blank range in the info war.
[02:08:12.676 --> 02:08:15.298]  That means starting a neighborhood newsletter.
[02:08:15.398 --> 02:08:16.879]  I mean a handout paper newsletter.
[02:08:17.099 --> 02:08:19.481]  That means going up and sticking it in the other local newspaper.
[02:08:20.317 --> 02:08:31.261]  You know, stickin' that flyer in there, in the green sheets, that means, just, just, and I want you to image firing a huge howitzer at an enemy ship, right off the deck of a submarine.
[02:08:31.281 --> 02:08:36.303]  I want you to imagine you're on the deck of a submarine, goin' boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:08:36.543 --> 02:08:37.644]  And just don't stop!
[02:08:38.084 --> 02:08:43.906]  Just all of us, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, firing, just never stopping!
[02:08:43.966 --> 02:08:45.767]  Fire, fire, fire, fire!
[02:08:46.227 --> 02:08:47.589]  That's how we deal with these people.
[02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:53.258]  We don't talk about, you know, whether we're winning or not, or what the score is, or what's... Are there propaganda?
[02:08:53.458 --> 02:08:59.527]  When Tokyo Rose sits up there telling us, you're gonna lose your life, G.I., you can't win, we just wolf-pack them!
[02:09:30.143 --> 02:09:31.444]  These are murdering scum!
[02:09:31.724 --> 02:09:34.866]  You think DynCorp locally in Austin likes it?
[02:09:35.126 --> 02:09:35.846]  You think they like it?
[02:09:35.866 --> 02:09:40.289]  I get on the air and I talk about how they kidnapped 200,000 women and children and took them to slave camps.
[02:09:40.929 --> 02:09:42.730]  Somebody's got to talk about that!
[02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:53.096]  You think I like getting up here talking about how they use Labrador Retrievers for shark bait as they swim along with a big hook in their snout so these nouveau riche yuppies can watch them get eaten by great whites for their enjoyment?
[02:09:53.116 --> 02:09:54.837]  Because they're decadent puss bags?
[02:09:55.572 --> 02:09:57.094]  I don't like my job, folks.
[02:09:57.394 --> 02:09:59.017]  I don't like having to fight this thing.
[02:09:59.177 --> 02:09:59.777]  But you know what?
[02:09:59.818 --> 02:10:00.939]  We don't have a choice.
[02:10:02.441 --> 02:10:04.343]  It's time to stop mentioning words.
[02:10:04.564 --> 02:10:06.306]  It's time to stop playing games.
[02:10:06.546 --> 02:10:08.929]  It's time to quit playing around!
[02:10:09.069 --> 02:10:10.471]  This isn't a drill!
[02:10:10.631 --> 02:10:11.893]  This isn't a joke!
[02:10:12.515 --> 02:10:14.616]  These people want your family.
[02:10:14.776 --> 02:10:15.877]  They want your money.
[02:10:16.057 --> 02:10:17.217]  They want your mind.
[02:10:17.397 --> 02:10:18.438]  They want your freedom.
[02:10:18.618 --> 02:10:20.279]  They think you belong to them.
[02:10:20.299 --> 02:10:21.899]  Now I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:28.503]  Every single one of you listen, whether you're a firefighter, a cop, a school teacher, a government agent, an auto mechanic.
[02:10:29.343 --> 02:10:31.524]  Do you want to be a bootlicking slave?
[02:10:31.544 --> 02:10:34.345]  Because you're going to be one.
[02:10:35.086 --> 02:10:39.888]  Unless you get some backbone and you say, I don't believe a word you say, you lying scum.
[02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:49.314]  We're going to go back to... We're going to go back to... Russell in Florida a minute.
[02:10:49.394 --> 02:10:50.895]  Paul, do you have any comments on that rant?
[02:10:51.816 --> 02:10:53.057]  Well, I couldn't say it any better.
[02:10:54.838 --> 02:10:56.079]  I've found another article.
[02:10:56.139 --> 02:11:02.303]  People sending emails on Time Warner Cable with links to Cindy Sheehan's website.
[02:11:02.843 --> 02:11:04.384]  Those links were censored.
[02:11:04.865 --> 02:11:06.266]  That's from the Brad blog.
[02:11:06.666 --> 02:11:10.989]  So, Cindy Sheehan is now a racist, hateful extremist as well, I guess.
[02:11:12.594 --> 02:11:13.275]  Just everyone.
[02:11:13.315 --> 02:11:14.617]  Anyone who doesn't agree with the government.
[02:11:14.997 --> 02:11:15.217]  Yep.
[02:11:16.559 --> 02:11:21.966]  Well, you need to write a big article about this and just, just... Block police takeover web.
[02:11:22.286 --> 02:11:25.310]  You know, the Chinese model has begun.
[02:11:25.590 --> 02:11:26.712]  Total censorship of the web.
[02:11:26.732 --> 02:11:27.633]  I mean, it's happening!
[02:11:29.136 --> 02:11:33.080]  Listen, folks, if we were a battleship, this is what you'd be hearing on now.
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:34.041]  Whoop!
[02:11:34.301 --> 02:11:34.922]  Whoop!
[02:11:35.162 --> 02:11:35.582]  Whoop!
[02:11:35.642 --> 02:11:37.064]  Enemy flotillas coming in!
[02:11:37.084 --> 02:11:37.664]  They're firing!
[02:11:37.684 --> 02:11:38.265]  They're firing!
[02:11:38.285 --> 02:11:39.847]  I mean, it's a war, folks!
[02:11:39.867 --> 02:11:40.948]  We're under attack!
[02:11:41.188 --> 02:11:42.910]  We're engaging the enemy!
[02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:44.111]  Attack them!
[02:11:44.311 --> 02:11:45.152]  Attack them!
[02:11:45.942 --> 02:11:46.562]  I'm sorry, Paul.
[02:11:46.602 --> 02:11:48.903]  I just... I wish people would get their heads screwed on!
[02:11:49.164 --> 02:11:50.184]  They want to kidnap us!
[02:11:50.204 --> 02:11:50.944]  They want to kill us!
[02:11:51.104 --> 02:11:52.645]  They want to cut our hearts out!
[02:11:52.805 --> 02:11:54.026]  They want to send us into war!
[02:11:54.066 --> 02:11:55.687]  They want to inject us with deadly poison!
[02:11:55.867 --> 02:11:57.467]  They're devil worshippers!
[02:11:57.848 --> 02:11:59.348]  Watson, what do you have to say to them?
[02:11:59.628 --> 02:12:00.829]  What do you have to say to the enemy?
[02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:06.811]  It's come to the end of the line and it's time for people to choose which side they're on.
[02:12:07.912 --> 02:12:11.394]  Let me tell you something, we're coming for you and you're gonna pay!
[02:12:11.714 --> 02:12:12.795]  And you know it, don't ya?
[02:12:13.335 --> 02:12:14.555]  You murdering scum!
[02:12:14.736 --> 02:12:15.916]  We're coming for you!
[02:12:16.156 --> 02:12:17.417]  We're coming for you!
[02:12:17.437 --> 02:12:23.040]  Go ahead, finish, I'm sorry.
[02:12:25.442 --> 02:12:48.017]  Oh yeah, if it gets to the point where our little websites in comparison compared to their monolithic media conglomerations cannot be tolerated then they're the ones with the problem and we're the ones with the people on our side and people need to rally around something like this to really point the fingers at who's attacking freedom in this country and it's quite obvious who's doing it now.
[02:12:49.545 --> 02:12:55.187]  They are systematically butchering this country and the people can stand by while they're butchering this nation.
[02:12:55.227 --> 02:12:57.969]  Folks, they got us hung up by our ankles gutting us right now.
[02:12:58.469 --> 02:13:00.410]  That's the analogy and I'm not going to put up with it.
[02:13:02.190 --> 02:13:02.651]  But you know what?
[02:13:02.671 --> 02:13:03.711]  They're nervous right now, Paul.
[02:13:03.731 --> 02:13:04.171]  You can see it.
[02:13:04.191 --> 02:13:07.032]  They're skittering and scared and furtive, aren't they?
[02:13:08.853 --> 02:13:14.676]  Yeah, which is why they have to come out and give press conferences after every little announcement they make to try and defend it all.
[02:13:15.116 --> 02:13:17.957]  They're nervous and people on the inside have said the same thing.
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:20.001]  So it's coming to an end.
[02:13:20.501 --> 02:13:21.001]  Either way.
[02:13:21.021 --> 02:13:24.702]  Yeah, they know we see them now.
[02:13:24.802 --> 02:13:26.543]  More people than ever see them.
[02:13:27.683 --> 02:13:29.384]  And I use the they live analogy.
[02:13:29.424 --> 02:13:32.105]  More and more of us have got the sunglasses on and they know it, folks.
[02:13:32.985 --> 02:13:35.366]  And all we gotta do is short out that transmitter.
[02:13:35.666 --> 02:13:37.227]  Again, if you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about.
[02:13:37.487 --> 02:13:38.848]  And everybody's gonna see.
[02:13:39.188 --> 02:13:40.768]  We're real close to the tipping point.
[02:13:41.009 --> 02:13:43.409]  And I say they're probably gonna pull something big real fast, Paul.
[02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:45.150]  I see something really bad in the works.
[02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:47.411]  Because they're afraid.
[02:13:49.266 --> 02:13:53.749]  You know, before they wanted to carry out big events to get total control, but I think now they've got to do it just to survive, Paul.
[02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:58.292]  Well, yeah, and like a junkie, they have to have bigger hits each time.
[02:13:59.312 --> 02:14:01.734]  Which is why people aren't buying it.
[02:14:01.794 --> 02:14:11.800]  People aren't buying the security terror paradigms, though now they've shifted it over to natural disasters and pandemics, which is what this press conference was about yesterday.
[02:14:15.103 --> 02:14:17.384]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Russell, in Florida.
[02:14:17.404 --> 02:14:17.684]  Sorry.
[02:14:18.004 --> 02:14:19.325]  Alex, thanks for holding me over.
[02:14:20.565 --> 02:14:26.047]  The main thing, I'm going to talk about what I wanted to bring up another time because I don't want to get you guys off topic.
[02:14:26.867 --> 02:14:28.288]  You're on a roll here.
[02:14:29.228 --> 02:14:30.348]  We didn't choose this fight.
[02:14:30.388 --> 02:14:31.369]  We were chosen, Alex.
[02:14:32.169 --> 02:14:32.789]  We didn't choose it.
[02:14:32.829 --> 02:14:33.409]  We were chosen.
[02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:36.030]  It's something we have to do.
[02:14:36.090 --> 02:14:40.212]  Everybody out there that's listening, they know what they have to do.
[02:14:41.492 --> 02:14:42.773]  If they don't do it, they're going to be judged.
[02:14:44.212 --> 02:14:44.732]  That's all I have to say.
[02:14:44.752 --> 02:14:46.353]  We're not going to be judging the other lives.
[02:14:46.813 --> 02:14:47.853]  We're going to be judging both lives.
[02:14:47.873 --> 02:14:50.354]  You know, when you lay down to tyranny, folks, bad things happen.
[02:14:51.614 --> 02:14:54.455]  And the sick part is, their whole mechanism is full of good people.
[02:14:55.155 --> 02:14:58.456]  Most of these people out there that enforce for them aren't bad, they're just stupid.
[02:15:00.656 --> 02:15:02.497]  Alex, I mean, why don't they get it?
[02:15:02.557 --> 02:15:04.017]  Why do we get it and why don't they get it?
[02:15:04.317 --> 02:15:07.818]  Something spiritual or something innate is different about us.
[02:15:08.598 --> 02:15:10.639]  That we want to fight and they don't even see it.
[02:15:11.727 --> 02:15:12.467]  It's like they live.
[02:15:12.487 --> 02:15:13.448]  You were mentioning they live.
[02:15:13.588 --> 02:15:17.270]  They don't see it, we do.
[02:15:17.630 --> 02:15:18.431]  It's like that movie though.
[02:15:18.451 --> 02:15:20.252]  It's like walking around seeing them for what they are.
[02:15:20.272 --> 02:15:21.112]  It really gets old.
[02:15:22.573 --> 02:15:25.775]  I'll call in another time about a show idea I have for you that I think you're going to like.
[02:15:25.935 --> 02:15:26.735]  God bless, Alex.
[02:15:26.755 --> 02:15:27.416]  Thanks a lot, buddy.
[02:15:27.436 --> 02:15:28.156]  I appreciate it.
[02:15:28.176 --> 02:15:33.539]  Let's talk to Moyne in Mississippi.
[02:15:33.559 --> 02:15:34.420]  Moyne, thanks for holding.
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:35.740]  Thank you there, Al.
[02:15:36.581 --> 02:15:38.382]  Afternoon to you and evening to Paul.
[02:15:39.673 --> 02:15:41.955]  You got me a, uh, you got you a hate caller here.
[02:15:42.655 --> 02:15:43.956]  I hate the way you woke me up, man.
[02:15:44.237 --> 02:15:51.442]  Back in October 2002, I turned down the old shortwave and I thought you were lush for, uh, that idiot Rush Limbaugh.
[02:15:52.663 --> 02:15:54.545]  I haven't been listening ever since you woke me up.
[02:15:55.466 --> 02:15:56.927]  I hate your videos, man.
[02:15:56.947 --> 02:15:57.667]  They got me, too.
[02:15:57.828 --> 02:16:03.172]  I mean, we gotta get out there and get these videos to these people, cause there's, there's some blind people out there.
[02:16:03.192 --> 02:16:07.055]  They go to church on Sundays and they're, they're just worshiping the beast out there.
[02:16:07.235 --> 02:16:08.276]  It's revelations.
[02:16:09.147 --> 02:16:11.609]  Thirteen, you wouldn't know about the Bible, right, Alex?
[02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:14.031]  I marvel at the beast myself.
[02:16:14.071 --> 02:16:15.592]  This thing is just unbelievable.
[02:16:15.612 --> 02:16:16.873]  You gotta hate that beast.
[02:16:17.393 --> 02:16:22.277]  Because our government and all them leaders, we'd be talking about that world ogre we smell.
[02:16:23.538 --> 02:16:27.882]  Listen, I do hate it, but I fight it because I love my family, but I do marvel at it.
[02:16:27.942 --> 02:16:30.324]  I mean, I marvel at just how it's unbelievable.
[02:16:30.824 --> 02:16:35.067]  You know, marveling means like when a tornado is coming at you, you marvel at it like, whoa!
[02:16:35.768 --> 02:16:36.829]  Like, look at that!
[02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:38.310]  How do you people not see it?
[02:16:39.659 --> 02:16:42.821]  But if we're going to worship the beast, we're denying Christ.
[02:16:44.763 --> 02:16:45.983]  It's Revelation 13, 11.
[02:16:46.043 --> 02:16:47.985]  It speaks of the United States.
[02:16:48.025 --> 02:16:51.247]  That beast coming up, that second beast power, comes out of the earth.
[02:16:52.188 --> 02:17:00.874]  It's going to give us a chance, or we're going to either decide we're going to worship that first beast, or the other one that came up in the sea, over there in Rome.
[02:17:01.514 --> 02:17:02.995]  We've got our choices, people.
[02:17:03.436 --> 02:17:04.376]  There's always help.
[02:17:04.796 --> 02:17:05.617]  There's that Bible.
[02:17:05.777 --> 02:17:07.078]  We've always got to fall to that.
[02:17:09.012 --> 02:17:11.934]  Daniel 243 is world order.
[02:17:12.474 --> 02:17:16.976]  That Alex and Paul and all the ones out there you guys are talking about.
[02:17:16.996 --> 02:17:19.777]  They're the ones, they're not going to cleave one to another.
[02:17:19.937 --> 02:17:22.539]  No matter how hard they try, they're not going to get it done.
[02:17:22.699 --> 02:17:26.921]  They might give it a good effect and effort, but they're not going to get it done.
[02:17:27.161 --> 02:17:27.781]  Yeah, that's right!
[02:17:27.821 --> 02:17:28.542]  They fail!
[02:17:29.902 --> 02:17:31.023]  And they always fail!
[02:17:31.043 --> 02:17:32.244]  They're going to fail this time!
[02:17:33.064 --> 02:17:33.864]  This is the big one.
[02:17:35.025 --> 02:17:37.146]  I mean, folks, you just can see the enemy hoard.
[02:17:37.822 --> 02:17:38.624]  And they're right there.
[02:17:38.664 --> 02:17:39.426]  They're coming at us.
[02:17:39.446 --> 02:17:40.769]  They're attacking us right now.
[02:17:40.889 --> 02:17:41.671]  Engage them!
[02:17:42.192 --> 02:17:42.733]  Crush them!
[02:17:42.753 --> 02:17:43.715]  We'll be right back.

[02:18:45.754 --> 02:18:47.355]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:19:46.214 --> 02:19:50.117]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:50.337 --> 02:20:02.606]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:03.027 --> 02:20:03.427]  The U.S.
[02:20:03.487 --> 02:20:09.071]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:09.471 --> 02:20:11.673]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:13.534 --> 02:20:14.594]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:20:14.614 --> 02:20:17.475]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:20:17.575 --> 02:20:23.617]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:20:24.038 --> 02:20:27.379]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[02:20:45.768 --> 02:20:51.409]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[02:20:51.569 --> 02:20:57.631]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your game without even trying.
[02:20:57.711 --> 02:21:01.331]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder product.
[02:21:01.371 --> 02:21:02.592]  We've all had enough of those.
[02:21:02.852 --> 02:21:05.552]  I'm talking about God's pure, whole food.
[02:21:05.592 --> 02:21:08.413]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[02:21:08.513 --> 02:21:13.114]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expensive
[02:21:13.274 --> 02:21:13.935]  We're good to go.
[02:21:40.333 --> 02:21:40.573]  That's OK.
[02:21:40.613 --> 02:21:40.993]  That's OK.
[02:21:57.026 --> 02:21:58.407]  Central Standard Time.
[02:21:58.507 --> 02:22:00.368]  Fighting Nazis.
[02:22:00.528 --> 02:22:01.629]  Fighting the Zionists.
[02:22:01.849 --> 02:22:03.250]  Fighting the Lurikan Pistots.
[02:22:03.390 --> 02:22:04.851]  Fighting the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:22:05.312 --> 02:22:15.259]  They all work for the same international bankers who want to keep us all at each other's throats while they rob, steal, kill, and destroy.
[02:22:15.339 --> 02:22:16.399]  And it's not going to work.
[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:22.724]  I'm only going to take two more calls because I want to talk about some news with Paul and play a clip of Eisenhower warning us about the military-industrial complex.
[02:22:23.913 --> 02:22:27.316]  But first, here is our great leader who is now openly announcing he wants to be a dictator.
[02:22:27.656 --> 02:22:29.898]  That's what these posse commentatis announcements are.
[02:22:30.258 --> 02:22:32.660]  Make no mistake, that's even what the scholars are saying.
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:35.201]  Here in the Associated Press and even CNN.
[02:22:35.221 --> 02:22:36.262]  But ah, maybe it's needed.
[02:22:37.223 --> 02:22:38.644]  Bush told us what he wanted back in 2000.
[02:22:39.204 --> 02:22:39.885]  He said it again in 2001.
[02:22:40.705 --> 02:22:41.706]  Now here it is.
[02:22:42.367 --> 02:22:43.047]  But that's okay.
[02:22:43.067 --> 02:22:46.570]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:22:48.091 --> 02:22:49.412]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:22:54.759 --> 02:22:56.221]  So secret, I can't talk about it.
[02:22:57.041 --> 02:22:58.082]  Play it one more time for folks.
[02:22:58.102 --> 02:23:00.884]  I want you to hear this creature.
[02:23:02.185 --> 02:23:02.886]  But that's okay.
[02:23:02.906 --> 02:23:06.389]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:09.211]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:23:13.014 --> 02:23:16.797]  Somebody's never done anything in his life without a big, fat, silver foot in his mouth.
[02:23:17.609 --> 02:23:19.390]  Twitting around, little fairy.
[02:23:20.171 --> 02:23:23.153]  Acting tough, swaggering around in commando outfits.
[02:23:23.613 --> 02:23:25.274]  You know, getting out of aircraft.
[02:23:25.354 --> 02:23:27.616]  It's just... It's pathetic!
[02:23:27.656 --> 02:23:28.796]  And again, he's a puppet!
[02:23:28.856 --> 02:23:31.758]  A grueling, sycophantic puppet!
[02:23:32.619 --> 02:23:36.341]  Gun-grabbing, open border promoting, torture promoting, and you idiots!
[02:23:36.561 --> 02:23:36.962]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:41.204]  Some of the foolish neocons out there, call this guy a conservative.
[02:23:41.605 --> 02:23:42.945]  I'M SICK OF IT!
[02:23:44.066 --> 02:23:45.127]  Paul Watson comments.
[02:23:46.678 --> 02:23:51.522]  Well, he's about as conservative as a Lynne Cheney lesbian sex novel.
[02:23:52.222 --> 02:23:55.445]  I joked on that article, you know, what's next?
[02:23:55.925 --> 02:24:02.631]  Bush announcing Chairman Mao as the new Secretary of Education to try and move American colleges away from liberal bias.
[02:24:03.671 --> 02:24:08.976]  Because he's appointed somebody who, again, is just a neocon yes woman.
[02:24:09.736 --> 02:24:14.380]  She's pro-women in the military, wants them to register for selective service,
[02:24:15.654 --> 02:24:29.563]  She's pro-homosexual adoption, pro-international criminal court, and she helped Bush cover up his draft-dodging activities by protecting the guy who later testified under oath, Barnes.
[02:24:31.525 --> 02:24:42.812]  That's what happened, that Bush was... But you know, we say they're desperate, and nobody is buying into them anymore, very few, and the whole New World Order is being revealed, but they just keep moving ahead!
[02:24:43.826 --> 02:24:47.129]  Well yes, because they live in their own reality, as they've said.
[02:24:47.149 --> 02:24:51.072]  They don't care what the truth is, they make up the truth.
[02:24:51.532 --> 02:24:57.117]  So they could have 99% of the population against them, they'd do exactly the same thing and say the same thing.
[02:24:57.137 --> 02:25:07.926]  And they know that, that's why they're militarizing the police and trying to restrict our free speech, because as they said in 1984, Big Brother can only get away with lying incessantly if no one's there to challenge it.
[02:25:10.527 --> 02:25:10.947]  Exactly.
[02:25:10.987 --> 02:25:20.492]  So, I mean, how far are we from a Ceausescu-like situation whereby the illusion that these people are living in is shattered, you know, one morning?
[02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:21.573]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:25:21.593 --> 02:25:25.234]  I mean, he, like, kisses women on the lips routinely on TV.
[02:25:25.254 --> 02:25:32.638]  He has, uh, on TV, putting his hand, you know, on the lap of, uh, of, uh, Condi, uh, Liza Rice.
[02:25:33.178 --> 02:25:37.421]  He's, like, rubbing on the head of Gannon, hugging him and, like, massaging his neck on TV.
[02:25:37.461 --> 02:25:39.982]  I mean, I mean, is there no end to this, Paul?
[02:25:41.275 --> 02:25:48.538]  Like, the most interesting examples of his behavior are things which occur, you know, when he's not concentrating, when he's not doing any kind of speech.
[02:25:48.978 --> 02:25:56.741]  You know, like cleaning his spectacles on the clothing of some Letterman staffer without her even noticing.
[02:25:57.121 --> 02:25:58.862]  Just the treatment of other people, you know.
[02:25:58.882 --> 02:26:00.422]  Flipping the bird.
[02:26:00.442 --> 02:26:02.103]  He did that again recently.
[02:26:02.143 --> 02:26:03.444]  Yeah, they act like we don't exist!
[02:26:04.084 --> 02:26:04.524]  Exactly.
[02:26:08.115 --> 02:26:08.715]  It's crazy.
[02:26:08.755 --> 02:26:09.996]  It's so pathological.
[02:26:10.036 --> 02:26:11.536]  I mean, he's just a complete lunatic.
[02:26:12.316 --> 02:26:14.337]  I mean, it drives me crazy watching it happen.
[02:26:14.357 --> 02:26:15.457]  I mean, this is insane, Paul.
[02:26:16.177 --> 02:26:17.458]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[02:26:17.518 --> 02:26:19.178]  Rodney, you're on the air in Georgian, California.
[02:26:19.198 --> 02:26:19.758]  That's it for polls.
[02:26:20.018 --> 02:26:20.618]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[02:26:21.038 --> 02:26:22.999]  Hey, thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:26:23.039 --> 02:26:24.980]  And Mr. Watson, thank you.
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:26.720]  Pleasure talking with you.
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:29.101]  Alex, I'm so glad that you
[02:26:31.895 --> 02:26:38.258]  Help me to understand that I'm not paranoid because over the weekend I got a chance to go to your website.
[02:26:38.418 --> 02:26:48.582]  I think it was late Sunday night, early Monday morning and I read a couple articles and then later I tried to go to the website and I was blocked.
[02:26:48.602 --> 02:26:52.963]  It said the website was in, that it was an error and that it was inaccessible.
[02:26:54.324 --> 02:26:55.384]  Was that a Friday?
[02:26:55.404 --> 02:26:55.444]  No.
[02:26:58.297 --> 02:26:58.818]  Sunday.
[02:26:59.178 --> 02:27:03.060]  Tom Warner's been doing it on and off, but now it's nationwide.
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:06.821]  Yeah, yeah, and as a matter of fact, I want to throw another name in there for you.
[02:27:07.021 --> 02:27:09.242]  SPC, because that's my provider.
[02:27:10.843 --> 02:27:11.444]  SPC.
[02:27:11.904 --> 02:27:12.764]  I'm really sick of it.
[02:27:12.784 --> 02:27:13.865]  Yeah, okay, stay there, Rodney.
[02:27:13.885 --> 02:27:14.605]  I want you to finish up.
[02:27:15.185 --> 02:27:17.286]  No, no, I mean, it's almost every library.
[02:27:17.306 --> 02:27:18.307]  I mean, I've been in libraries.
[02:27:18.327 --> 02:27:19.347]  You can't go to my websites.
[02:27:20.588 --> 02:27:22.449]  And again, you can always go to infoawards.net, though.
[02:27:23.917 --> 02:27:26.598]  And that's because somebody didn't put that in the filter software.
[02:27:26.778 --> 02:27:27.778]  Sure, they're listening and they will.
[02:27:28.739 --> 02:27:29.759]  But, uh, no, it's admitted.
[02:27:29.819 --> 02:27:31.000]  Our IT persons looked at it.
[02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:31.900]  They're just blocking us.
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:33.541]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.021 --> 02:27:36.942]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.422 --> 02:27:39.023]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.943 --> 02:27:42.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.751 --> 02:27:47.734]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:27:47.794 --> 02:27:50.677]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:27:50.878 --> 02:27:56.265]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:27:56.505 --> 02:27:58.027]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:27:58.067 --> 02:28:00.310]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:28:00.490 --> 02:28:04.055]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:28:04.355 --> 02:28:06.396]  And they can do it without due process.
[02:28:06.456 --> 02:28:13.378]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[02:28:13.558 --> 02:28:19.260]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:27.022]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property, or make it look like you own no property, and a whole lot more.
[02:28:27.062 --> 02:28:27.763]  We're good to go.
[02:28:46.337 --> 02:28:47.957]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.097 --> 02:28:52.178]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.338 --> 02:28:55.199]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.299 --> 02:29:02.020]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.201]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.401 --> 02:29:07.782]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.922 --> 02:29:10.122]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[02:29:10.242 --> 02:29:10.863]  We're good to go!
[02:29:37.305 --> 02:29:37.566]  Call 808-803-4438.
[02:29:37.626 --> 02:29:38.006]  That's 808-803-4438.
[02:29:38.067 --> 02:29:39.409]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:46.531 --> 02:29:50.414]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:29:50.554 --> 02:29:52.295]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:29:52.375 --> 02:29:53.616]  But not just any water.
[02:29:53.716 --> 02:29:57.920]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:07.687]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:30:07.987 --> 02:30:13.612]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[02:30:13.792 --> 02:30:18.377]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[02:30:18.557 --> 02:30:22.501]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[02:30:22.961 --> 02:30:29.545]  Call any of RPA Biotech's Electrolyzed Iodizing Water Solution products for a full 30-day satisfaction guarantee.
[02:30:29.645 --> 02:30:38.049]  Hear the interview with GCN's Dr. Diegel at Nutramedical.com and for more information visit rpa-biotech.com or call 1-866-884-9104.
[02:30:38.069 --> 02:30:38.469]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:52.682]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.162 --> 02:30:55.965]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.985 --> 02:31:06.495]  Yeah, if you ever can't get to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net is still up for those of you that have Time Warner, New World Order, Satan Table.
[02:31:07.716 --> 02:31:12.100]  Also, you can go to
[02:31:13.931 --> 02:31:19.456]  A lot of other sites out there on the web that have links, or you can just save the audio links to listen to the show.
[02:31:20.136 --> 02:31:22.618]  They're into your favorites on your desktop.
[02:31:22.658 --> 02:31:25.000]  That's always smart to do.
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:27.102]  Or just listen on that local AM or FM station.
[02:31:27.583 --> 02:31:30.645]  And if you don't have a local AM or FM station in your area, get one!
[02:31:30.765 --> 02:31:32.206]  Call those mom and pop stations.
[02:31:32.727 --> 02:31:34.208]  Call those local AM stations.
[02:31:34.408 --> 02:31:35.950]  You can forget it with the big ones.
[02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:39.232]  And, you know, that are owned by the two big conglomerates.
[02:31:40.133 --> 02:31:42.215]  And tell them, pick up the Alex Jones Show!
[02:31:43.181 --> 02:31:44.502]  Don't worry, we'll get your ratings.
[02:31:44.802 --> 02:31:45.842]  We've got those, by the way.
[02:31:45.883 --> 02:31:49.224]  You can call the network and they can show you the Arbitron from some of our markets.
[02:31:49.785 --> 02:31:55.007]  We'll take stations that don't even make the book, and six months after we're on with them, they'll have a four share.
[02:31:55.067 --> 02:31:57.569]  And then a year after, they'll have a six or seven share.
[02:31:57.629 --> 02:32:01.310]  And then, in some cases, we're on a couple years, you'll have a ten, a twelve.
[02:32:01.631 --> 02:32:03.271]  Stuff that talk radio isn't even getting.
[02:32:03.652 --> 02:32:05.072]  Because we just tell the truth!
[02:32:05.473 --> 02:32:06.653]  There's no scripting.
[02:32:06.673 --> 02:32:07.834]  There's no act here.
[02:32:08.314 --> 02:32:09.655]  We just tell it like it is.
[02:32:10.895 --> 02:32:11.876]  That's why they have
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:17.862]  History Channel specials, you know, that have massive viewership about the Illuminati, where they try to whitewash it.
[02:32:17.902 --> 02:32:19.143]  They have to talk about it.
[02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:20.903]  It's where the audience is.
[02:32:21.384 --> 02:32:22.164]  But they twist it.
[02:32:22.504 --> 02:32:23.004]  We don't.
[02:32:24.165 --> 02:32:34.669]  And again, notices being attacked over and over again by all these groups, by the State Department, and the ADL, and foreign governments, and, ooh, Downing Street's aware of what we're doing now.
[02:32:34.969 --> 02:32:36.110]  It's in the newspaper now.
[02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.970]  They're looking at us.
[02:32:37.606 --> 02:32:38.046]  Why?
[02:32:38.587 --> 02:32:39.968]  Because we collate it.
[02:32:40.008 --> 02:32:42.290]  We collect the data, as George Normy has said.
[02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:47.854]  I'll get 20 articles that were all buried where the British admit they're carrying out terror attacks on themselves.
[02:32:48.114 --> 02:32:49.435]  And I'll just post them all together.
[02:32:49.495 --> 02:32:49.995]  Poll will.
[02:32:51.677 --> 02:32:54.339]  Or I'll warn you that the government wants martial law.
[02:32:54.439 --> 02:32:55.379]  Now it's happening.
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:58.062]  Now our credibility is shooting up even higher.
[02:32:58.482 --> 02:32:59.803]  But don't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:33:00.473 --> 02:33:08.800]  This is part of the farewell address of Eisenhower on January 17, 1961, four days before Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, took office.
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:11.482]  Listen to him carefully.
[02:33:11.862 --> 02:33:14.284]  This is exactly what he's warning of.
[02:33:14.705 --> 02:33:19.509]  The undue influence of the military-industrial complex buying up and taking everything over.
[02:33:19.549 --> 02:33:22.211]  The universities, the corporations, everything.
[02:33:22.851 --> 02:33:24.773]  A military coup d'etat.
[02:33:25.333 --> 02:33:26.454]  This is now happening.
[02:33:26.854 --> 02:33:27.615]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:33:28.676 --> 02:33:29.857]  In the Councils of Government,
[02:33:30.407 --> 02:33:39.549]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:33:40.789 --> 02:33:46.050]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:33:47.551 --> 02:33:52.772]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
[02:33:53.732 --> 02:33:55.112]  We should take nothing for granted.
[02:33:56.593 --> 02:33:58.853]  Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry
[02:33:59.690 --> 02:34:00.471]  We're good to go!
[02:34:30.032 --> 02:34:34.074]  It also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly.
[02:34:35.255 --> 02:34:41.298]  A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of the federal government.
[02:34:42.518 --> 02:34:53.704]  Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields.
[02:34:54.764 --> 02:34:57.766]  In the same fashion, the free university
[02:34:59.474 --> 02:35:08.321]  Historically, the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.
[02:35:09.782 --> 02:35:19.109]  Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.
[02:35:20.430 --> 02:35:25.494]  For every old blackboard, there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:38.828]  The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever-present, and is gravely to be regarded.
[02:35:39.228 --> 02:35:39.569]  Alright.
[02:35:40.129 --> 02:35:41.010]  And he goes on and on.
[02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:45.793]  And now they've bought everything up, 90 plus percent of research is federal, most of it DARPA.
[02:35:46.334 --> 02:35:47.534]  I mean, folks, I've been to UT.
[02:35:47.595 --> 02:35:48.795]  It's open mind control.
[02:35:48.835 --> 02:35:56.401]  The areas I was allowed to see in the psychology department are how to control you through wavelength flickers on TV screens.
[02:35:57.529 --> 02:36:03.314]  You understand, I have been allowed in to the unclassified areas and they don't even hide it.
[02:36:03.674 --> 02:36:16.424]  DARPA, documents everywhere, giant plasma screen TVs, monkeys scrapped in with mind control wires, huge, huge systems and they're practicing flickering, manipulating with flickers the monkey can't even see.
[02:36:16.844 --> 02:36:18.426]  This is the hell I live in!
[02:36:18.966 --> 02:36:20.267]  Only because I'm informed!
[02:36:20.507 --> 02:36:23.950]  The hell can go away if we stand up and wake up to it and spite it!
[02:36:24.904 --> 02:36:29.906]  I mean, miles from where I sit, they are in there practicing mind control on you.
[02:36:30.966 --> 02:36:32.486]  Everything is geared to this now.
[02:36:33.407 --> 02:36:40.109]  And the stupid public, not stupid, the mesmerized public under this mind control is drooling and saying it doesn't exist.
[02:36:40.409 --> 02:36:46.170]  Paul Watson, we're about to go back and let Rodney and then George finish up, but what did you think of that famous clip of the President?
[02:36:46.811 --> 02:36:49.271]  I guess he would be listed as an evil terrorist today.
[02:36:50.252 --> 02:36:51.372]  It was very hateful, yes.
[02:36:52.504 --> 02:36:56.245]  It should be expunged from all historical records down the memory hole.
[02:36:57.045 --> 02:37:06.508]  You mentioned people not, even though it's so obvious and externalised, it seems that this leads some people to turn away from it even more.
[02:37:07.048 --> 02:37:17.951]  Using the They Live example, putting the sunglasses on, we can see the truth, but during the making of that film, where they had massive billboards saying, Obey, Submit, Do Not Question Authority,
[02:37:18.687 --> 02:37:28.895]  The director, John Carpenter, was amazed by the fact that people would walk past those giant billboards and not even notice the fact that they said this.
[02:37:28.915 --> 02:37:29.256]  That's right.
[02:37:29.276 --> 02:37:31.618]  He talked about that on the new DVD extras.
[02:37:32.718 --> 02:37:39.524]  Which just shows how much trouble we are in if the sizable portion of the population thinks like that.
[02:37:39.624 --> 02:37:41.205]  So it's kind of split in two waves.
[02:37:41.245 --> 02:37:41.926]  Yeah, submit.
[02:37:41.966 --> 02:37:42.807]  You're a slave.
[02:37:42.827 --> 02:37:44.508]  You know, do as you're told.
[02:37:44.608 --> 02:37:45.449]  Giant billboards.
[02:37:45.489 --> 02:37:47.030]  And they just, oh, it's totally normal.
[02:37:47.050 --> 02:37:47.210]  Yep.
[02:37:51.244 --> 02:37:51.624]  I know.
[02:37:51.805 --> 02:37:53.746]  It's people's self-censor.
[02:37:53.926 --> 02:37:54.787]  Cognitive dissidence.
[02:37:54.807 --> 02:37:56.288]  They decide to do both.
[02:37:56.329 --> 02:37:57.429]  That's double think, Paul.
[02:37:59.651 --> 02:37:59.932]  It is.
[02:37:59.952 --> 02:38:01.053]  It's cowardice.
[02:38:01.693 --> 02:38:12.302]  As you said, the conscience, the ego makes a split-second decision to deny the truth because it sees it as a threat to the existence that it had led up to that point.
[02:38:12.342 --> 02:38:13.824]  So that's the decision they make.
[02:38:16.446 --> 02:38:17.647]  Rodney, finish up what you were saying.
[02:38:18.513 --> 02:38:21.416]  Yeah, I wanted to briefly comment on what I just heard.
[02:38:21.436 --> 02:38:27.402]  It was extremely powerful and I really never listened to it as closely as I did.
[02:38:28.043 --> 02:38:29.865]  You want to stare at the whole thing this week?
[02:38:30.145 --> 02:38:38.654]  Oh man, that's powerful, but the thing that I got out of it is where he said only a knowledgeable and informed citizenry can put up an offensive.
[02:38:39.364 --> 02:38:45.632]  I've seen a lot of Eisenhower speeches, and he never stumbles or is paranoid.
[02:38:45.892 --> 02:38:50.377]  There's a noise, and he looks fearful of the side, and he keeps looking over fearfully.
[02:38:50.577 --> 02:38:55.443]  Yeah, and that's why I was going to ask you, what do you think induced him to make this speech?
[02:38:55.764 --> 02:38:59.368]  I could hear it in the tape there, Alex, but I want to say this.
[02:39:00.402 --> 02:39:01.803]  Exactly what he said.
[02:39:01.823 --> 02:39:08.067]  A knowledgeable, informed citizenry can put up an offensive against this military industrial complex.
[02:39:08.387 --> 02:39:16.492]  And then Kennedy at American University, two weeks before he got killed, gave a speech saying, the CIA's taking over, there's an evil group dominating us, I'm going to rip them up.
[02:39:17.113 --> 02:39:18.874]  And man, they blew his head clean off.
[02:39:18.974 --> 02:39:20.255]  And this is what you're doing.
[02:39:20.275 --> 02:39:25.898]  You're giving us the knowledge so that we can be informed to be able to put up this offensive.
[02:39:25.938 --> 02:39:28.500]  So you're a threat, and you have what you've done.
[02:39:29.444 --> 02:39:30.785]  And this is in Revelations.
[02:39:31.786 --> 02:39:33.948]  The masses are growing like locusts.
[02:39:34.588 --> 02:39:35.929]  The people are waking up.
[02:39:36.570 --> 02:39:46.158]  And this is the reason why I believe that you and others who are putting this information out there are being turned on because they've got to put a stop to this.
[02:39:46.318 --> 02:39:53.664]  They don't want the masses to have this knowledge so that we can be informed and see that the Emperor has no program.
[02:39:53.784 --> 02:39:54.645]  I hear you, Rodney.
[02:39:54.725 --> 02:39:55.465]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:57.086]  Let's let George in California talk.
[02:39:57.107 --> 02:39:58.348]  George, thanks for holding.
[02:39:58.368 --> 02:39:58.768]  Go ahead.
[02:39:59.628 --> 02:40:02.069]  Hi Alex and Steve, how are you?
[02:40:02.970 --> 02:40:04.070]  It's Paul Watson.
[02:40:04.431 --> 02:40:05.011]  I'm sorry, Paul.
[02:40:05.031 --> 02:40:05.972]  That's okay, his brother Steve.
[02:40:07.532 --> 02:40:13.216]  I have one question for you Alex and then one for Paul.
[02:40:13.696 --> 02:40:24.182]  Did you get a chance to hear about a survey that came out October 3rd in regard to forced vaccinations or state control?
[02:40:24.802 --> 02:40:25.822]  No, I didn't see that.
[02:40:25.963 --> 02:40:26.583]  Who did the study?
[02:40:27.442 --> 02:40:35.025]  This was actually done by the American Academy of Pediatrics and this was done by Aaron A. Flanagan, Cligas MD.
[02:40:35.325 --> 02:40:36.306]  Okay, well what did they say?
[02:40:36.846 --> 02:40:46.490]  And what they said basically is responses to the survey suggest that the pediatricians faced with vaccine refusal may seek to end their relationships with refusing families.
[02:40:47.133 --> 02:40:47.713]  Well, that's right, yeah.
[02:40:47.733 --> 02:40:49.094]  They did the same with the MMR vaccine.
[02:41:07.968 --> 02:41:13.072]  Parents are going to jail for not allowing their kids to have these vaccines in schools.
[02:41:13.573 --> 02:41:15.054]  The kids are being kicked out of school.
[02:41:15.094 --> 02:41:16.295]  The parents are going to jail.
[02:41:16.755 --> 02:41:23.281]  But there's no law that you've got to take the shot, but by not going to school, even though they kick you out, then they charge you for truancy.
[02:41:23.301 --> 02:41:24.322]  Same thing is done here.
[02:41:24.862 --> 02:41:25.022]  Right.
[02:41:25.042 --> 02:41:30.206]  Because here in the state of California, you have three exemptions to allow not being able to get the shot.
[02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:35.030]  But even at the same time, when you read those exemptions, the administrator of the vaccine
[02:41:36.518 --> 02:41:37.680]  They take no responsibility.
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:39.982]  In fact, that's a California law here.
[02:41:40.302 --> 02:41:51.892]  Well, I mean, literally every day a new study comes out where it causes autoimmune deaths, bizarre muscular viral attacks, bizarre paralyzing events, massive brain damaging.
[02:41:51.912 --> 02:41:54.935]  I mean, these things are like, this is being done by design.
[02:41:54.955 --> 02:41:57.938]  And again, the average person goes, they want to hurt me by design.
[02:41:58.298 --> 02:42:00.260]  Yes, folks, they want to hurt you.
[02:42:00.931 --> 02:42:07.412]  And then the poor doctor, well I don't want to hurt anybody, so the whole world must be like me so these vaccines are good.
[02:42:07.432 --> 02:42:20.735]  Another report I read also claimed that even the doctors themselves are taking a pay anywhere between $50 to $150 per each shot that they administer to the child paid by the drug corporations.
[02:42:21.155 --> 02:42:24.115]  Yes, even more than the vaccine's worth.
[02:42:24.155 --> 02:42:25.196]  There is a bounty.
[02:42:25.496 --> 02:42:26.916]  It's so important.
[02:42:27.529 --> 02:42:42.258]  This is crazy, but one final comment with this here is that Dr. Hendricks, who was part of this study, noted that a policy statement published earlier this year in the American Academy of Pediatrics commented that even if the families appear to be working against the best interest of the child,
[02:42:42.856 --> 02:42:54.064]  And at that point, they want to put laws in the books stating that they want state control so that if they see the child is put in significant risk, meaning that the parent will not allow them to take the vaccine.
[02:42:54.484 --> 02:42:56.525]  Yeah, they're trying to pass laws.
[02:42:56.645 --> 02:42:57.546]  They're trying to pass laws.
[02:42:57.566 --> 02:42:58.166]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:58.867 --> 02:43:00.007]  No, I mean, that's the point.
[02:43:00.708 --> 02:43:02.129]  Forcible inoculation.
[02:43:03.177 --> 02:43:04.498]  Look, they did pass a law.
[02:43:04.898 --> 02:43:09.500]  It's page 76 of Homeland Security, forced injection of whatever they want, whenever they want.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:15.363]  Now they have to talk about making it the law, because they know you'll freak out if they tell you, we just did it already.
[02:43:15.903 --> 02:43:16.143]  See?
[02:43:16.443 --> 02:43:21.786]  See, they... We beat the law about the transponders in the cars, but they've ordered the two million transponders.
[02:43:22.286 --> 02:43:24.187]  Paul, you want to explain that to them, how this operates?
[02:43:26.027 --> 02:43:31.350]  Well, yeah, I mean, Bush just announced it yesterday, catapulting the propaganda, to paraphrase him.
[02:43:32.176 --> 02:43:41.546]  The bird flu crisis or any other pandemic crisis is going to be used as part of that agenda of forced quarantines and forced inoculations.
[02:43:41.586 --> 02:43:44.950]  They got a shot, they really want to give it to you, it's important, trust them.
[02:43:45.691 --> 02:43:50.937]  Yeah, again, Chinese model, SARS, they did exactly the same thing, forced quarantines.
[02:43:51.802 --> 02:43:54.726]  Um, house arrest and forced inoculations.
[02:43:55.067 --> 02:44:00.013]  They seem to take everything from the game book of the Chinese totalitarian government.
[02:44:00.033 --> 02:44:00.934]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:44:00.974 --> 02:44:04.199]  I mean, that's what China does, is they simply block websites.
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:07.042]  Yeah, and they've been doing it decades.
[02:44:08.087 --> 02:44:13.571]  It seems that every policy is taken from China, just a few years down the line after China does it.
[02:44:13.671 --> 02:44:14.351]  Well, the U.N.
[02:44:14.391 --> 02:44:15.692]  gives China all the awards.
[02:44:15.772 --> 02:44:16.833]  They are the model.
[02:44:16.873 --> 02:44:17.954]  You want to see your future?
[02:44:18.314 --> 02:44:25.819]  Mobile execution vans being skinned, so yuppies can inject their lips with your flesh, with the collagen.
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:29.281]  Troops stomping around, just beating you up.
[02:44:29.341 --> 02:44:30.262]  Total enslavement.
[02:44:30.302 --> 02:44:31.183]  Ha ha ha.
[02:44:31.823 --> 02:44:33.224]  I mean, that's your future, America.
[02:44:35.788 --> 02:44:39.509]  And the average Chinese, you know, folks that I get emails from, they're happy.
[02:44:39.529 --> 02:44:40.750]  They go, oh, we've got freedom over here!
[02:44:42.611 --> 02:44:44.871]  Yeah, and then you get Mao's Restaurant.
[02:44:45.051 --> 02:44:49.593]  We've got one in my own city where all the trendies go and the menu's in a little red book.
[02:44:50.213 --> 02:44:52.334]  We've got so many of those here in the U.S.
[02:44:53.214 --> 02:44:55.395]  Mao's Restaurants in Denver and other areas.
[02:44:56.596 --> 02:44:58.736]  Selling genocide as trendy culture.
[02:45:00.157 --> 02:45:01.758]  Well, he only killed 60 million people.
[02:45:02.178 --> 02:45:02.618]  Well, yeah.
[02:45:03.837 --> 02:45:05.958]  Think about a sports stadium of 100,000.
[02:45:05.998 --> 02:45:08.318]  The biggest sports stadium holds 110,000.
[02:45:08.738 --> 02:45:10.979]  How many 110,000's fit into 60 million?
[02:45:10.999 --> 02:45:13.920]  I mean, try to get a grasp of 60 million, folks.
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:18.621]  But we're against the Chinese people, Paul, because we don't want to kill 60 million of them.
[02:45:18.641 --> 02:45:19.701]  We want to save them, so we're bad.
[02:45:20.301 --> 02:45:20.461]  Right.
[02:45:23.082 --> 02:45:25.742]  I've actually been accused of that because I'm against what China does to their people.
[02:45:27.163 --> 02:45:27.903]  Isn't that freedom, Paul?
[02:45:28.982 --> 02:45:34.027]  Well, it's just a football mentality associated with a brand or a label.
[02:45:35.308 --> 02:45:38.851]  If you're from China, then does that mean you should support the Chinese government?
[02:45:38.931 --> 02:45:41.553]  And anyone that criticizes the government is criticizing you.
[02:45:41.633 --> 02:45:45.797]  It's just basic lack of intelligence on every level.
[02:45:46.077 --> 02:45:51.081]  Well, Paul, killing babies and selling them for medical experiments, which is publicly admitted, you know, that's freedom.
[02:45:51.702 --> 02:45:53.823]  And the reports are they take live babies, folks.
[02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:54.444]  They don't kill them.
[02:45:54.464 --> 02:45:55.885]  They're being sold for experiments that way.
[02:45:56.205 --> 02:45:56.646]  But, you know,
[02:45:57.759 --> 02:46:01.841]  If you're against torturing Chinese babies, Paul, you're bad.
[02:46:02.262 --> 02:46:11.727]  The State Department says that's not true, though, and anyone that says it is a conspiracy theorist, even though the State Department admitted it on their own website on a different page.
[02:46:13.608 --> 02:46:15.529]  And then the Chinese government said, what's the big deal?
[02:46:15.569 --> 02:46:16.390]  This is customary.
[02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.890]  Yep.
[02:46:19.591 --> 02:46:20.412]  This is our custom.
[02:46:21.306 --> 02:46:25.730]  Same with the injecting the skin of executed prisoners as beauty products.
[02:46:25.930 --> 02:46:27.631]  The company was like, what's the big deal?
[02:46:27.972 --> 02:46:30.054]  They were surprised that anyone would even question it.
[02:46:32.636 --> 02:46:34.477]  Well, I mean, we're just bad, Paul.
[02:46:34.497 --> 02:46:40.783]  You know, you heard the parable of the good king, who was good and just, and everybody drank from the poison well, the witch poison.
[02:46:41.063 --> 02:46:43.525]  So they all went crazy and became evil, and he was the wise king.
[02:46:43.545 --> 02:46:45.787]  He went and drank from the well, and everything was okay.
[02:46:45.827 --> 02:46:46.988]  I think that's an evil parable.
[02:46:47.958 --> 02:46:50.300]  But maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe we are bad, Paul.
[02:46:50.660 --> 02:47:02.711]  You know, if we would have been being back to the Aztecs a thousand years ago when they were cutting out, you know, a couple hundred hearts a day and ten thousand once a year on a holiday, and we'd have said, don't kill your children, we would have been the crazy ones.
[02:47:03.792 --> 02:47:12.600]  And how is it different from today where people kill their own babies, sacrifice them to further their own careers so the baby won't get in the way of financial prosperity?
[02:47:12.660 --> 02:47:14.962]  How is it that different from what the Aztecs did?
[02:47:17.458 --> 02:47:17.959]  Exactly!
[02:47:18.719 --> 02:47:19.200]  We're sick!
[02:47:19.340 --> 02:47:21.261]  We are totally screwed up, Paul.
[02:47:22.402 --> 02:47:26.346]  And by the way, folks, you let one of these big sins in, all the rest come in.
[02:47:27.146 --> 02:47:30.389]  It is a literal plague upon us.
[02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:31.870]  A plague on our heads, Paul.
[02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:32.571]  We are cursed.
[02:47:34.352 --> 02:47:35.053]  Let's just admit it.
[02:47:37.675 --> 02:47:39.997]  So I guess, in a way, people are going to get what they deserve, Paul.
[02:47:41.919 --> 02:47:44.601]  Well, I mean, people speculate as God removed His protection.
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:49.482]  You know, that, everything, biblical events going on every few months.
[02:47:49.582 --> 02:47:52.003]  What else can, can it lead us to think?
[02:47:52.284 --> 02:47:54.104]  Bow down to the one you serve.
[02:47:54.145 --> 02:47:55.885]  You're going to get what you deserve.
[02:47:57.987 --> 02:47:59.207]  What is that, Nine Inch Nails?
[02:48:00.468 --> 02:48:02.149]  Bow down before the one you serve.
[02:48:02.169 --> 02:48:03.409]  You're going to get what you deserve.
[02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.911]  Ugh, man.
[02:48:07.251 --> 02:48:10.213]  Well, you know, we've had it good so long, Paul, I think people just can't get it.
[02:48:13.328 --> 02:48:18.671]  Well, they don't understand that their life is a drop in the ocean of eternity, but changes do happen.
[02:48:19.431 --> 02:48:23.833]  Many people say that change will never happen, but it will, and it will get a lot worse before it gets better.
[02:48:24.033 --> 02:48:24.873]  That's clear now.
[02:48:25.294 --> 02:48:27.615]  And it already has, just in the last couple of years.
[02:48:27.955 --> 02:48:29.255]  Yeah, a lot of us are gonna die.
[02:48:29.616 --> 02:48:30.356]  That's clear, too.
[02:48:31.296 --> 02:48:31.977]  C'est la vie.
[02:48:32.177 --> 02:48:33.838]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:48:35.518 --> 02:48:36.879]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:46.968 --> 02:48:49.851]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.091 --> 02:48:51.672]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.013 --> 02:48:56.696]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.037 --> 02:49:03.742]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.082 --> 02:49:06.064]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.264 --> 02:49:09.107]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.187 --> 02:49:13.891]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.071 --> 02:49:18.475]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:25.942]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.202 --> 02:49:28.604]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.764 --> 02:49:30.506]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.329 --> 02:49:51.573]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.713 --> 02:49:59.799]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.059 --> 02:50:07.104]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.284 --> 02:50:08.564]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:08.644 --> 02:50:14.525]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.725 --> 02:50:19.806]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.926 --> 02:50:28.808]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:29.068 --> 02:50:32.349]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:35.289]  We're good to go!
[02:51:02.737 --> 02:51:03.338]  I think so.
[02:51:23.217 --> 02:51:23.417]  I think so.
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:48.701]  Here's CNN.
[02:51:49.782 --> 02:52:03.428]  Dr. Erwin Redliner, Associate Dean of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and Director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, he's the National Director, folks, told the Associated Press the President's suggestion was dangerous.
[02:52:04.189 --> 02:52:08.271]  And he said the translation of this is martial law in the United States.
[02:52:08.291 --> 02:52:14.934]  Do you understand, folks, it is permanent, red dawn, enslavement, secret arrest,
[02:52:16.013 --> 02:52:19.435]  Terror teams dragging men out of the house in the middle of the night.
[02:52:20.616 --> 02:52:24.259]  Snatch and grab, GRU, Soviet Union, China.
[02:52:25.700 --> 02:52:27.061]  Play the piece of Phil.
[02:52:27.341 --> 02:52:27.821]  Here's Bush.
[02:52:28.722 --> 02:52:29.022]  Yes.
[02:52:30.983 --> 02:52:31.904]  Thank you for the question.
[02:52:32.845 --> 02:52:34.406]  I am concerned about avian flu.
[02:52:35.787 --> 02:52:39.909]  I'm concerned about what an avian flu outbreak could mean for the United States and the world.
[02:52:42.551 --> 02:52:43.192]  I have thought through
[02:52:45.908 --> 02:52:49.669]  The scenarios of what an avian flu outbreak could mean.
[02:52:50.349 --> 02:52:56.730]  I try to get a better handle on what the decision-making process would be by reading Mr. Berry's book on the influenza outbreak in 1918.
[02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:59.131]  I would recommend it.
[02:53:00.471 --> 02:53:07.493]  The policy decisions for a president dealing with an avian flu outbreak are difficult.
[02:53:09.313 --> 02:53:12.314]  One example, if we had an outbreak somewhere in the United States
[02:53:12.935 --> 02:53:15.197]  Do we not then quarantine that part of the country?
[02:53:15.237 --> 02:53:16.878]  And how do you then enforce a quarantine?
[02:53:19.180 --> 02:53:20.481]  One thing is to shut down airplanes.
[02:53:21.582 --> 02:53:25.245]  It's another thing to prevent people from coming in to get exposed to the avian flu.
[02:53:27.127 --> 02:53:29.349]  And who best to be able to effect a quarantine?
[02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:35.373]  One option is the use of a military that's able to plan and move.
[02:53:37.075 --> 02:53:38.356]  So that's why I put it on the table.
[02:53:39.255 --> 02:53:42.176]  I think it's an important debate for Congress to have.
[02:53:42.236 --> 02:53:45.078]  I noticed the other day, evidently some governors didn't like it.
[02:53:45.098 --> 02:53:45.678]  I understand that.
[02:53:45.718 --> 02:53:48.319]  I was the commander-in-chief of the National Guard, and proudly so.
[02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:53.402]  And frankly, I didn't want the President telling me how to be the commander-in-chief of the Texas Guard.
[02:53:55.123 --> 02:53:57.564]  But Congress needs to take a look at circumstances that may
[02:53:59.435 --> 02:54:00.156]  Okay, there you go.
[02:54:00.556 --> 02:54:02.697]  They've covertly built their force against us.
[02:54:02.737 --> 02:54:03.337]  I mean, I've been there.
[02:54:03.357 --> 02:54:06.699]  They're trying to take your guns and kick your teeth in and break your family up.
[02:54:06.739 --> 02:54:06.939]  Okay?
[02:54:07.099 --> 02:54:07.700]  I got video.
[02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:09.701]  Marines trying to take your children from you.
[02:54:10.541 --> 02:54:11.582]  You got me, folks.
[02:54:12.222 --> 02:54:14.963]  You understand this isn't a drill, this isn't a joke, this isn't a game.
[02:54:15.844 --> 02:54:17.705]  Those birds fly around all over the place.
[02:54:17.725 --> 02:54:18.765]  You can't stop it.
[02:54:19.886 --> 02:54:22.027]  And it's not even that dangerous.
[02:54:22.067 --> 02:54:24.568]  It's a bunch of hype and a bunch of patriots have picked up on it.
[02:54:24.909 --> 02:54:25.909]  It's a fraud.
[02:54:26.149 --> 02:54:26.970]  Just like SARS.
[02:54:27.010 --> 02:54:27.570]  Paul Watson?
[02:54:28.672 --> 02:54:38.672]  Well, you had top Russian biologists and WHO representatives two years ago saying that a billion people would die from avian flu within a year.
[02:54:39.173 --> 02:54:40.154]  What happened to that?
[02:54:40.834 --> 02:54:46.358]  And then, I mean, look at the history of the government itself deliberately releasing these bioweapons, the anthrax attacks.
[02:54:46.378 --> 02:54:58.505]  Bottom line, they're going to nerve gas a bunch of people and have some slow-acting poison and have one of their scientists say they found the bug, and any time they're in trouble, they can just lock down an area and have a big media circus and train us how to be slaves.
[02:54:58.525 --> 02:55:01.347]  This is the process of bathing us in slavery, Paul.
[02:55:02.270 --> 02:55:06.552]  Exactly, and that press conference was directed to that very purpose.
[02:55:06.933 --> 02:55:08.293]  It wasn't spontaneous.
[02:55:08.774 --> 02:55:12.636]  Every Bush press conference is admittedly scripted beforehand.
[02:55:12.716 --> 02:55:15.177]  The questions, the answers are already scripted.
[02:55:15.357 --> 02:55:16.558]  That's been mainstream news.
[02:55:16.938 --> 02:55:21.341]  Paul, prisonplanet.tv, Infowars.com, they're all up for people to come visit.
[02:55:21.561 --> 02:55:27.024]  Unless you've got Time Warner, Cable, Roadrunner, or any of their subsidiary systems, you've got to get off of it.
[02:55:27.544 --> 02:55:29.825]  I mean, we are sick and tired of them blocking our sites.
[02:55:30.245 --> 02:55:32.086]  They're doing it on purpose, and we're going to expose it.
[02:55:32.186 --> 02:55:33.806]  When's that big article going to come out, Paul?
[02:55:35.067 --> 02:55:35.767]  Within an hour.
[02:55:35.967 --> 02:55:36.827]  Yeah, the sooner the better.
[02:55:36.887 --> 02:55:37.487]  Thank you, my friend.
