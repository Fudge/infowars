[00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:06.282]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.943 --> 00:00:07.983]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:09.865]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.306]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:12.967]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:17.571]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.895]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:37.869]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.111]  It is Monday, the 24th day of October 2005.
[00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:47.874]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and scrap yourselves in.
[00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:54.857]  We're going to have Scott Ritter on the broadcast with a bunch of new developments and talking about his new book that's coming out.
[00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:56.258]  He was the Marine...
[00:00:57.714 --> 00:00:59.175]  We're good to go.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:32.709]  When those entire wings of the prison where the torture was going on was under CIA control, she wasn't even allowed into those areas.
[00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:33.910]  They tried to scapegoat her.
[00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.731]  We've talked a lot about this.
[00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:46.121]  Because by scapegoating someone who's innocent, then when the trail runs dry, when they investigate her, then they can say, see, she wasn't involved in torture.
[00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.562]  Well, no kidding.
[00:01:48.163 --> 00:02:04.293]  So this is another one of the little scams they run, and we'll be talking to the general who is really blowing the whistle with some huge, huge revelations a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:02:04.313 --> 00:02:07.314]  So both of those guests joining us today.
[00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.035]  We're also going to have wide open phones.
[00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:12.137]  Take some calls in this hour and throughout all three hours.
[00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:12.678]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:13.298]  And here's the deal.
[00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:19.575]  Folks, you can call once a week.
[00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:22.315]  And I always love our long-time callers.
[00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:24.856]  It's just that a lot of people email me and call.
[00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:27.958]  When they finally get in, they say, Listen, I've been trying to call for six months.
[00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:29.158]  The phones are always busy.
[00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:30.739]  I can't ever get through.
[00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.059]  See, we don't screen calls.
[00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.600]  We just ask what your first name is, where you're calling from.
[00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:42.335]  But we do really want first-time callers, or people who don't call a lot, or folks who call once a month or whatever.
[00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:44.575]  But you're welcome to call in once a week.
[00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:48.216]  And obviously if there's some emergency, you can call in more than once a week.
[00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:52.197]  But 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we will be getting your calls.
[00:02:52.217 --> 00:02:53.517]  Hurricane Wilma...
[00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:15.609]  Public advisory starting to slam into the southern tip of Florida and the Florida Keys after it ravaged areas of the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:19.351]  They eventually got martial law down there to, quote, deal with looting.
[00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:28.754]  And now Hurricane Wilma, with about 125-mile-an-hour winds, is slamming into Florida, and it's pretty serious.
[00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:33.336]  But not as bad as it could have been when this sucker went into Category 6,
[00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:41.669]  Status, back on last Thursday, over 175 miles per hour.
[00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:47.231]  It doesn't go into level 6, but they're now saying that's what it really hit.
[00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:48.752]  The scale only goes to 5.
[00:03:50.632 --> 00:03:53.293]  Bushy's feeling the boss's wrath.
[00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:56.675]  This is out of the New York Daily News.
[00:03:56.715 --> 00:03:58.195]  We've known this for several years.
[00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:02.997]  Bush goes into convulsive rages, throwing things,
[00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:04.708]  We're good to go.
[00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:23.036]  Freakouts.
[00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:26.517]  And Capitol Hill Blue reported on Lord Clinton doing that.
[00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:28.038]  It also reported on Bush doing it.
[00:04:28.058 --> 00:04:29.798]  They've always been very accurate.
[00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:34.860]  Other publications with sources in Washington inside the White House said the same thing.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.962]  Now here it is in the New York Daily News, a watered-down version of it, but Lord Bush throwing fits.
[00:04:42.722 --> 00:04:47.483]  Also, lawyers in CIA leak case say charges possible this week without other lawyers.
[00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:50.044]  Hank Holter says get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:50.744]  I'm not kidding.
[00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:55.825]  And so much more massive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:59.206]  Infowars.net, prisonplanet.com.
[00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:09.490]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:14.513]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:20.355]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:25.117]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.337 --> 00:05:32.521]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:37.043]  oil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.223 --> 00:05:39.724]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:46.067]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional
[00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:46.247]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:02.796]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.177 --> 00:06:08.901]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:14.285]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:23.913]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.253 --> 00:06:29.236]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:33.539]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:38.482]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:44.846]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:46.027]  Get the Berkey Light.
[00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:54.155]  The standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:55.296]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:56.438]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.521]  And most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:07:23.257 --> 00:07:23.758]  We're good to go.
[00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:24.218]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:38.554]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:38.774]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:06.434]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:08.155]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.055]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:11.476]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:13.036]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:17.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.938 --> 00:08:22.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:29.743]  Welcome to all our listeners across the United States listening on AM, FM, shortwave, satellite, internet.
[00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:30.483]  Welcome to...
[00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:35.164]  Who are wonderful listeners across the globe listening on the shortwave and the internet.
[00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:42.605]  Welcome to you as well and all the ships at sea listening via the global shortwave and even the internet now.
[00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.146]  We have that technology.
[00:08:44.806 --> 00:08:48.327]  Welcome as far south as the McMurtle weather station.
[00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:51.547]  We get emails and letters from there and even occasional phone calls.
[00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:55.028]  I want to say hi to all the folks down in Antarctica listening.
[00:08:55.668 --> 00:09:00.289]  And of course all the great listeners in Japan, China, Mexico, the United States.
[00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:08.122]  Germany, England, you name it, I am honored, I am humbled, I am thankful to be your host.
[00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:14.128]  And then of course the good old home crowd, right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:18.011]  All of you listening, thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:22.095]  For those that are joining us for the first time, that are driving along in their car, or...
[00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:41.193]  Are tuning in via the internet because somebody sent you an email and said, listen to this show, and so you're having your little 30-minute lunch in your office cubicle in New York City right now, and you're biting into your tuna fish sandwich listening, and you're wondering, what is this broadcast, what is this show all about?
[00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:42.514]  It's about freedom!
[00:09:43.214 --> 00:09:44.775]  You'll hear me bash Hillary.
[00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:46.817]  You'll hear me savage Bush.
[00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:56.845]  You'll hear me go after Michael Wiener and Ann Coulter and in the same breath-attack-era America as corporate false-left paradigm Bilge.
[00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:58.407]  Who is this guy?
[00:09:58.467 --> 00:09:59.968]  We can't put a label on him.
[00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:05.673]  Until a hundred years ago, left-right didn't exist.
[00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:23.207]  And the big corporations, the big banks came in and paid off the political scientists, paid off the universities, funded the endowments and the chairs that are set up in the universities.
[00:10:24.648 --> 00:10:29.973]  To promote a false left-right paradigm and to push a centralization of government.
[00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:33.736]  In the past it was freedom versus slavery.
[00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:39.241]  So I look at what a politician is actually doing, not what they're saying.
[00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:45.366]  I look at a policy and I say, does that give me and my family more liberty or less freedom?
[00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:52.682]  Does that follow the Constitution, or does that violate the Constitution?
[00:10:52.722 --> 00:10:57.484]  We really do what Ron Paul does, the Congressman, with the most conservative voting record in modern history.
[00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:09.307]  He simply, it's very easy, he shows a legislation, he simply reads it, and if it violates the Constitution or Bill of Rights, even if he likes it, he will vote against it.
[00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:17.752]  And if they give him 30 minutes to read an 800-page bill, and folks, they've given him multi-thousand-page bills.
[00:11:18.392 --> 00:11:19.412]  I mean, they do that all the time.
[00:11:19.452 --> 00:11:21.433]  They say, vote on it, you've got five minutes.
[00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:25.414]  It's a 400-and-something-page bill, but we're voting in five minutes.
[00:11:25.715 --> 00:11:30.296]  He says, sorry, I might even be four what's in there, but I've got to be able to read it.
[00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:37.419]  And he's tried to get a law passed, along with many others, to pass a law where congressmen have to read their bills, but instead...
[00:11:38.348 --> 00:11:43.669]  Corporations basically own staffers like they own real estate, and they just write whatever they want.
[00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:47.850]  Thousands and thousands of new federal laws every year.
[00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.590]  Tens of thousands of new state laws every year.
[00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.291]  Hundreds of thousands of city and county laws.
[00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.211]  Laws, laws everywhere.
[00:11:55.431 --> 00:11:57.812]  You know, they say ignorance of the law is no defense.
[00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:02.912]  NAFTA took several wheelbarrows to carry.
[00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:05.613]  NAFTA was...
[00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:10.907]  Literally tens and tens and tens of thousands of pages long.
[00:12:11.327 --> 00:12:17.450]  Just the synopsis was 14,000 pages, if memory serves.
[00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:20.752]  The synopsis.
[00:12:20.932 --> 00:12:22.032]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:26.337]  We defend the Second Amendment.
[00:12:26.377 --> 00:12:27.618]  We defend the border.
[00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:29.220]  We defend the sovereignty.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.641]  We defend the family.
[00:12:30.962 --> 00:12:34.265]  We defend everything that is decent and honorable.
[00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:38.410]  We stand up against the people shutting up a world government.
[00:12:39.904 --> 00:12:45.068]  And they openly announce every day on TV and radio and in the newspaper, world government's here.
[00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:48.311]  Five, ten years ago you talked about world government, you were to cook.
[00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.492]  Now they admit world government.
[00:12:50.513 --> 00:12:57.018]  And they say, oh, but it'll be a loving, liberal, UN-run world government or an evil American neocon world government.
[00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:58.459]  See, that's the scam.
[00:12:58.499 --> 00:12:59.800]  That's the real illusion.
[00:13:01.107 --> 00:13:04.449]  Is that they know now that the people are rebelling against one world government.
[00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:05.529]  So they give you a choice.
[00:13:05.609 --> 00:13:13.393]  Okay, you can have the loving UN who's against attacking Iraq, or you can have the evil, hateful, right-wing American world government.
[00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:17.975]  When the world government's owned by the same financial interests, they give you a false choice.
[00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:19.676]  They control the paradigm.
[00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.017]  It's paradigm management.
[00:13:21.277 --> 00:13:29.501]  And I repeat this because so many activists, so many intellectuals, so many conservatives, so many liberals or progressives...
[00:13:30.555 --> 00:13:33.357]  Cannot get outside of this box.
[00:13:33.857 --> 00:13:35.318]  It is a false paradigm.
[00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:36.779]  It was given to you.
[00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:40.542]  It did not exist until 100 years ago, 105 years ago, roughly.
[00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:45.445]  Outside of a male-female connotation of left or right.
[00:13:45.505 --> 00:13:47.346]  Left being female, right being male.
[00:13:47.987 --> 00:13:48.347]  That's it.
[00:13:49.968 --> 00:13:51.230]  And so you're like a computer.
[00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.053]  They gave you a political virus so you couldn't compute.
[00:13:55.494 --> 00:13:58.757]  And you just keep shutting down real political debate.
[00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:03.421]  So I started another broadcast with that because it is so important.
[00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:05.683]  Alright, coming up.
[00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:09.407]  Bilderberg's Rumsfeld profit from avian flu scam.
[00:14:09.447 --> 00:14:10.568]  Now we already knew this, but
[00:14:11.474 --> 00:14:15.497]  And Dr. Horowitz talked about it last week, but there's just massive evidence of this.
[00:14:15.557 --> 00:14:22.642]  Rumsfeld, particularly, with the drug company he is a major stockholder in, is scheduled to make $4 to $7 billion.
[00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:23.503]  No one's sure.
[00:14:23.523 --> 00:14:27.486]  Depends on how big the run on the flu pill is.
[00:14:30.107 --> 00:14:31.869]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:36.492]  Also, Colonel quits as fears grow for safety of his men, London Telegraph.
[00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:39.354]  You know, you've been told that they've really got armored vehicles.
[00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:44.523]  They've got lots of neocon congressmen on TV and radio telling you they do.
[00:14:45.063 --> 00:14:45.984]  They do not.
[00:14:47.144 --> 00:14:49.565]  And so if the troops are going to be there, they might as well have it.
[00:14:49.985 --> 00:14:51.585]  And a lot has been made.
[00:14:51.765 --> 00:15:00.748]  Colonel Roberts last week pointed it out on this broadcast that they have got tens of thousands of armored vehicles and mothballs all over this country.
[00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:03.909]  And they're just not going to give them to the troops.
[00:15:04.209 --> 00:15:05.149]  It's really that simple.
[00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.533]  And I know I'm anti-military because I want them to have the right tools.
[00:15:09.593 --> 00:15:10.014]  I'm evil.
[00:15:10.094 --> 00:15:10.614]  I understand that.
[00:15:10.975 --> 00:15:19.664]  Questioning anything the government does for a still, zealous, bush-worshipping minority is equivalent to heresy.
[00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:23.087]  An amazing article I do want to spend some time on.
[00:15:23.228 --> 00:15:28.113]  Case for WTC Tower Demolition Sealed by Griffin.
[00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:44.133]  And it says, in two speeches to overflow crowds in New York City last weekend, notable theologian David Ray Griffin argued that recently revealed evidence seals the case that the Twin Towers and WTC7 were destroyed by controlled demolition explosives.
[00:15:44.413 --> 00:15:56.823]  This is from all the new firefighter tapes that are just ironclad, along with the other plethora, constellation of evidence, galaxy of evidence.
[00:15:58.121 --> 00:16:03.665]  Surprise, surprise, violations found in FBI surveillance records, Washington Post.
[00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:10.790]  Turns out, without warrants, without anything, they're just spying on citizens, whoever they want, non-terror-related cases.
[00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.531]  In fact, that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:17.455]  That's where they decide to use evidence that they've gained illegally in a trial.
[00:16:18.175 --> 00:16:21.478]  You might then hear about it if that then gets reported to the press.
[00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:26.283]  So, you know, they talk about all these thousands of cases of this.
[00:16:26.963 --> 00:16:32.246]  That's not even the, I mean, that's just the grazing surface.
[00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:36.468]  Harper's Magazine, how to live in a fascist state.
[00:16:37.028 --> 00:16:41.890]  Big publications like Harper's are coming out now explaining how to live in the new America, the new fascist state.
[00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.932]  I mean, we really are entering that space.
[00:16:46.468 --> 00:16:50.632]  And, you know, fascism, again, has this connotation of being on the right.
[00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:53.915]  Well, how is Hitler a national socialist of fascists?
[00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:57.779]  You see, this is how they confuse the terms.
[00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:07.468]  But fascism has more reality in its confines than some of the other terms that are used.
[00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:08.730]  And what is fascism?
[00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.012]  It is where a government...
[00:17:11.627 --> 00:17:21.240]  Basically, uses its power to go centralize control over the economy, and then gives that control to select corporations.
[00:17:22.662 --> 00:17:28.711]  And socialism, the communists always told us, led to, finally, communism.
[00:17:30.621 --> 00:17:33.163]  Socialism has never led to communism.
[00:17:33.223 --> 00:17:45.573]  Communism literally does not exist other than colonies of ants and bees and other communal hive insectoid organisms.
[00:17:46.293 --> 00:17:48.455]  It does not exist in human societies.
[00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:52.438]  Within a few minutes, you're going to have seen anarchy...
[00:17:55.897 --> 00:18:02.362]  It does not exist.
[00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:07.745]  So they always told us, oh, socialism will lead into the wondrous world of communism.
[00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:11.868]  But in every case, China, Russia, Cuba, everywhere.
[00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:20.014]  And this is why the bankers and David Rockefeller openly funded it, and write editorials in the New York Times explaining why they funded communism.
[00:18:20.774 --> 00:18:22.675]  I mean, people think McCarthy just made this stuff up.
[00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:25.216]  David Rockefeller brags how they funded it.
[00:18:25.256 --> 00:18:26.597]  They brag how they put Mao in.
[00:18:27.678 --> 00:18:29.559]  Because they would centralize control.
[00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:50.150]  So yes, you go into socialism and communism, it consolidates wealth, then once you get everybody dependent, you give the entire mechanisms of government and the control over labor and everything, and the private property that was expropriated to begin with, to select global robber barons that are above the nation states and form the global government.
[00:18:51.992 --> 00:18:53.492]  And really, it's imperialism.
[00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:55.753]  So forget the term fascism.
[00:18:56.053 --> 00:18:57.973]  We're dealing with imperialism.
[00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:00.594]  And the imperialists can use a democracy.
[00:19:00.654 --> 00:19:07.455]  They can use a democracy and propaganda to promise 51% goodies if they sell out the other 49%.
[00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:18.998]  Then once they've used that democracy to shut up that big centralized government, the government then abolishes the welfare and transfers all of its holdings to the private corporations that put them into power.
[00:19:19.498 --> 00:19:23.261]  Then you end up, again, with the corporate structure.
[00:19:24.682 --> 00:19:28.505]  Remember, Mussolini said we shouldn't call it fascism, it's corporatism.
[00:19:28.805 --> 00:19:30.286]  And he's absolutely right.
[00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:39.812]  And that's why Jiang Zemin in 99, 50 years of Mao, in Tiananmen Square said, capitalism is the ultimate expression of communism.
[00:19:40.193 --> 00:19:42.014]  And people did a double take and said, what?
[00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:46.057]  And see, even the liberal trendies won't listen to what he says.
[00:19:47.017 --> 00:19:48.478]  They'll call in here and we'll argue with them.
[00:19:49.459 --> 00:19:51.000]  Conservatives are listening, going, what?
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.942]  Capitalism is the ultimate expression of communism?
[00:19:54.462 --> 00:19:58.065]  Yes, they are identical, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.106]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:02.402]  We're good to go.
[00:20:27.483 --> 00:20:29.364]  You'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:21:02.236 --> 00:21:10.859]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:22.362]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:22.562 --> 00:21:25.223]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:29.644]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:32.025]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.047]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:34.247 --> 00:21:40.271]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:46.135]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:51.177 --> 00:21:51.878]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.909]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:22:04.069 --> 00:22:05.210]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.793]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:22:08.913 --> 00:22:09.334]  Phenol.
[00:22:09.654 --> 00:22:16.781]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:22:17.061 --> 00:22:21.185]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:22:21.285 --> 00:22:21.726]  Fragrance?
[00:22:22.106 --> 00:22:26.851]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:26.992 --> 00:22:31.677]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:34.460]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.144]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:22:38.284 --> 00:22:41.788]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:44.369]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:45.429]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:55.292]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.922]  It's different from the U.S.
[00:23:04.962 --> 00:23:05.202]  dollar.
[00:23:05.242 --> 00:23:07.404]  It's 100% inflation-proof because it's 100% backed by real silver.
[00:23:26.662 --> 00:23:33.244]  It's already the second most popular currency in the US, with 100,000 people using it to protect their purchasing power.
[00:23:33.624 --> 00:23:41.447]  G. Edward Griffin, the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, endorses and urges all Americans to get silver liberty dollars and beat inflation today.
[00:23:41.827 --> 00:23:44.248]  Don't stand by and watch your hard-earned money lose value.
[00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:44.908]  That's 1-800-639-3655
[00:24:10.141 --> 00:24:10.782]  We're good to go.
[00:24:41.207 --> 00:25:08.330]  And they went in, they take over, they call it communism, we're going to take your property, we're going to take your land, and then a few years later they start consolidating and handing it over to select global corporations who are outside the country's control but use that slave labor to then take those products and leverage out their competition in free countries, thus attacking the bankers' ancient enemy, the middle class, the independent free people's.
[00:25:09.742 --> 00:25:12.265]  And so that's why the Fortune 500 loves China.
[00:25:12.305 --> 00:25:13.747]  That's why they get all the UN awards.
[00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:15.309]  That's why they're the model.
[00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:20.014]  That's why George Bush doesn't criticize them and the UN loves them and gives them all the big awards.
[00:25:20.094 --> 00:25:22.177]  Because they are the model.
[00:25:22.537 --> 00:25:24.139]  They admit they put Mao in.
[00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:27.223]  They kicked the Nationalists out.
[00:25:28.914 --> 00:25:30.615]  That's now publicly admitted.
[00:25:30.655 --> 00:25:32.577]  We were coops to say that 20 years ago.
[00:25:32.937 --> 00:25:34.378]  Now it's openly admitted.
[00:25:34.438 --> 00:25:35.519]  Now it's openly taught.
[00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:38.622]  Oh, we thought Mao would be a better stabilizing effect.
[00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:41.524]  We thought he'd give us a better economy and a better people.
[00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:46.368]  That's what the CIA section chief five years ago said on the History Channel as I watched it.
[00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:48.930]  Now we already knew that, but there he was admitting it.
[00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.132]  Somebody that killed at least 50 million people.
[00:25:52.252 --> 00:25:54.234]  Mao was good, and then David Rockefeller...
[00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.372]  Comes out in the New York Times when Mao dies and says, oh, he did such a great job.
[00:25:59.733 --> 00:26:01.894]  Oh, he was so good, such a stabilizing effect.
[00:26:02.274 --> 00:26:03.655]  Again, the same M.O.
[00:26:04.715 --> 00:26:06.596]  The centralizing effect, you mean.
[00:26:07.797 --> 00:26:13.180]  We're going to go to Jeff in New Mexico who disagrees with something I've said, and then we're going to play a little clip here about the hurricane.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.483]  And then I'm going to get off into just a ton of news after we take some more calls in the next segment.
[00:26:18.823 --> 00:26:20.064]  Believe me, there's a lot coming up.
[00:26:20.164 --> 00:26:22.185]  And we also have the general who was...
[00:26:23.303 --> 00:26:27.325]  They're over the entire Abu Ghraib prison and other prisons in Iraq.
[00:26:28.166 --> 00:26:31.388]  And we're also going to have Scott Ritter on, so you don't want to miss that, the U.N.
[00:26:31.428 --> 00:26:32.128]  weapons inspector.
[00:26:32.148 --> 00:26:33.449]  A lot of new developments there.
[00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:45.176]  Let's go ahead and play this clip now, the latest with Wilma, that has now slowed down to 105 miles an hour from 125 earlier this morning, now crossing over southern Florida.
[00:26:45.216 --> 00:26:45.536]  Here it is.
[00:26:46.246 --> 00:26:47.007]  Big, big, big change!
[00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:04.305]  I don't know, a lot of damage.
[00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:05.666]  It's pretty bad.
[00:27:05.966 --> 00:27:10.168]  Hurricane expected to weaken as it tracks off the southern Florida peninsula later today.
[00:27:10.268 --> 00:27:11.069]  Oh, it's scary.
[00:27:11.189 --> 00:27:15.391]  All the walls are shaking and doors popping open.
[00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:16.651]  It's very scary.
[00:27:16.932 --> 00:27:18.993]  The Dow's up 95 points.
[00:27:19.093 --> 00:27:21.754]  This is USA Radio Network News.
[00:27:22.913 --> 00:27:25.095]  And that's just in the last few minutes, folks.
[00:27:25.115 --> 00:27:27.256]  So that's the latest there on that.
[00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:28.817]  Let's go to Jeff in New Mexico.
[00:27:28.837 --> 00:27:30.919]  I don't know what he disagrees about, but we'll find out.
[00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.380]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:40.606]  Yeah, Alex, I think on one of your shows one day you said that you're for this laissez-faire theory.
[00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:47.291]  No, I didn't say that, but whatever turns your fancy.
[00:27:47.751 --> 00:27:51.214]  I thought you said something about if somebody buys something from you,
[00:27:52.376 --> 00:28:00.400]  Even if it's not a good product, that you're not against that kind of treatment of other people, taking advantage of each other.
[00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:04.582]  No, I never said that, but, you know, you can say whatever you like.
[00:28:04.602 --> 00:28:19.470]  Okay, well, anyway, the Bible, you know, there's this, talks about the year of Jubilee, Leviticus 25, chapter 25, and even if you become poor and sell your land...
[00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.232]  You can get that land back later.
[00:28:22.792 --> 00:28:25.135]  You can read that in Leviticus.
[00:28:25.255 --> 00:28:31.261]  And since we're not under the year of Jubilee in the United States, we have the tax.
[00:28:32.242 --> 00:28:37.027]  I don't know what your opinion is on the... Why would you claim something that I obviously never said?
[00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:44.036]  Imagine me on air going, I'm for ripping people off and taking advantage of them and giving away with it.
[00:28:44.336 --> 00:28:45.857]  I mean, everybody knows I didn't say that.
[00:28:45.897 --> 00:28:46.838]  You know I didn't say that.
[00:28:47.339 --> 00:28:56.025]  That's not a very, hold on, that's not a very, I'd say a very sportsman-like way to debate me is make stuff up.
[00:28:56.546 --> 00:28:59.168]  Well, what's your opinion on the inheritance tax then?
[00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:02.631]  Oh, I've said I'm against the inheritance tax.
[00:29:03.672 --> 00:29:06.594]  Okay, well I... I'm against big taxes and taxes and
[00:29:07.566 --> 00:29:10.728]  I believe in very, very low taxes and constitutional taxes.
[00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:16.652]  Because we don't have the year of Jubilee, you seem to be Christian and go by the Bible.
[00:29:16.713 --> 00:29:19.815]  We don't have that, so we need inheritance tax.
[00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:23.757]  Otherwise, certain people are going to get richer and richer.
[00:29:24.058 --> 00:29:27.060]  Look, they already have it in tax-free foundations, Bubba.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.381]  They already don't pay taxes.
[00:29:29.582 --> 00:29:30.782]  They've got trusts.
[00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:34.265]  Trusts that are selectively left alone.
[00:29:35.382 --> 00:29:36.823]  Well, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:29:36.883 --> 00:29:37.443]  I really do.
[00:29:38.184 --> 00:29:39.724]  You know, sometimes I get calls like those.
[00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.666]  And, you know, that's a tactic.
[00:29:42.346 --> 00:29:46.088]  Why, you say you're for chopping people's heads off and eating their noses.
[00:29:46.548 --> 00:29:47.689]  Well, no, I never said that.
[00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:50.170]  I mean, how do you defend against something you didn't say?
[00:29:51.651 --> 00:29:52.632]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:54.653]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.553 --> 00:29:58.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.811]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:10.214]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[00:30:10.354 --> 00:30:11.735]  But now, we don't have to.
[00:30:12.015 --> 00:30:20.179]  This sacral wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:24.521]  Simply lie on your back with the sacral wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:27.562]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[00:30:27.962 --> 00:30:31.464]  Use the sacral wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[00:30:31.904 --> 00:30:35.567]  Get your sacral wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:30:35.827 --> 00:30:37.228]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:38.329 --> 00:30:39.910]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.114]  And ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment, too.
[00:30:45.494 --> 00:30:47.815]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[00:30:48.116 --> 00:30:51.438]  Get your sacral wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.
[00:30:51.718 --> 00:30:51.958]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:51.978 --> 00:30:52.259]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:53.239]  And give yourself a wedgie.
[00:31:02.376 --> 00:31:05.941]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:06.001 --> 00:31:06.501]  are located?
[00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:10.106]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:15.032]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.312 --> 00:31:20.318]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.558 --> 00:31:21.018]  We're good to go.
[00:31:21.038 --> 00:31:21.499]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:46.177]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.
[00:31:46.477 --> 00:31:51.884]  Get Prudent Places USA for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.004 --> 00:31:53.947]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:01.744 --> 00:32:10.371]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or one in three adults?
[00:32:10.731 --> 00:32:15.494]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[00:32:15.835 --> 00:32:19.778]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[00:32:20.118 --> 00:32:25.142]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[00:32:25.562 --> 00:32:29.345]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like joint care,
[00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:35.789]  ...whose safety and effectiveness in supporting healthy joints has been established in over 50 clinical trials and research studies.
[00:32:36.069 --> 00:32:43.153]  Joint care facilitates freedom of movement by promoting circulation and enhancing the overall functioning of the musculoskeletal system.
[00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:47.996]  Don't let arthritis stop you from doing the things you enjoy or leading a normal, healthy, and active life.
[00:32:48.236 --> 00:32:52.278]  Visit us online today at ResearchedHerbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-7000.
[00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:54.360]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:33:04.807 --> 00:33:05.307]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:07.329]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.809 --> 00:33:10.571]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.992 --> 00:33:14.574]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.935 --> 00:33:19.158]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:19.338 --> 00:33:20.899]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:20.939 --> 00:33:27.244]  You know, I got a whole bunch of cash that I want to put into the rotation of my bumper music.
[00:33:27.424 --> 00:33:29.005]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:32.908]  The taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.981]  I can't wait to go see that new Johnny Cash movie.
[00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:39.141]  And I like the actor that's going to play Johnny Cash.
[00:33:39.222 --> 00:33:40.562]  I just love Johnny Cash.
[00:33:41.542 --> 00:33:44.123]  And I've always loved Johnny Cash since I was about two years old.
[00:33:44.883 --> 00:33:52.105]  And I heard some punk a few months ago on the radio, some patriot talk show host, talking bad about Johnny Cash.
[00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:54.726]  Don't you have better things to do?
[00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:58.347]  All right, I'm really out of control now.
[00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:02.328]  I'd rather just drive around on a motorboat, folks, listening to Johnny Cash.
[00:34:02.348 --> 00:34:02.928]  I really want to know.
[00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:10.961]  In fact, I'd rather be sitting in a fancy dining car drinking coffee and smoking big cigars.
[00:34:11.921 --> 00:34:12.822]  All right, I'm sorry.
[00:34:13.562 --> 00:34:14.202]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:14.322 --> 00:34:15.642]  I'm going crazy on air.
[00:34:16.043 --> 00:34:16.663]  It's true!
[00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:19.064]  All right.
[00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:20.584]  No, I just like Johnny Cash.
[00:34:22.084 --> 00:34:25.285]  I saw a trailer online for the new Johnny Cash movie last night.
[00:34:25.305 --> 00:34:26.046]  It looks really good.
[00:34:26.886 --> 00:34:28.846]  It's made me sad Johnny Cash is dead.
[00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:32.948]  You know, I had a chance to... You know he's Jimmy Swaggart's cousin?
[00:34:33.028 --> 00:34:33.748]  What, first cousin?
[00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:48.083]  But I had a chance to see Johnny Cash a couple times live here in Austin once about ten years ago and then once about five years ago, one of the last times he played anywhere before he died a few years ago.
[00:34:49.204 --> 00:34:55.327]  And see, now I've spent a minute and a half talking about Johnny Cash and that's really not very good, folks.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:58.988]  That's bordering on talking about sports for ten hours.
[00:35:00.229 --> 00:35:03.371]  And yes, I wanted to watch part of the World Series last night.
[00:35:03.391 --> 00:35:04.231]  I mean, I wanted to watch the
[00:35:05.689 --> 00:35:08.651]  The Astros and the White Sox, but I didn't.
[00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:12.093]  You know what I was doing last night?
[00:35:13.453 --> 00:35:16.255]  Until the wee hours of the morn.
[00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:18.776]  I finished it.
[00:35:19.457 --> 00:35:21.178]  We added about five minutes.
[00:35:21.238 --> 00:35:22.939]  You hear the promo running on the local stations.
[00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:24.179]  I say it's a 43-minute film.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.560]  It's not true.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.762]  It's a 45-plus-plus-minute film now.
[00:35:30.331 --> 00:35:33.333]  And it is the Order of Death, and I'm very proud of it.
[00:35:33.693 --> 00:35:35.774]  What you've seen online, we put out a few weeks ago.
[00:35:35.794 --> 00:35:38.335]  It doesn't hold a candle to what we've done.
[00:35:38.355 --> 00:35:44.719]  I've added about five minutes, and really souped it up and added more images and more video.
[00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:49.121]  And it covers skull and bones tie-ins to Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:49.181 --> 00:35:52.903]  It covers the New Age occult groups and how they're being manipulated.
[00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:58.966]  It gets into just the occultism that permeates our society, the corporate symbols.
[00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:01.182]  And it's not even available yet.
[00:36:01.702 --> 00:36:03.162]  Not on DVD, not on VHS.
[00:36:03.222 --> 00:36:04.003]  It'll be in a few weeks.
[00:36:04.843 --> 00:36:08.705]  And last night I completed cutting down, I cut it down even more.
[00:36:08.765 --> 00:36:12.206]  What people saw at the Alamo Draft House, less is more, folks.
[00:36:12.507 --> 00:36:20.030]  A few weeks ago when I had two sell-out showings, overflow crowd showings there at the Alamo Draft House,
[00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:25.672]  That had been cut from 2 hours and 5 minutes to an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:30.196]  I have cut it down to exactly an hour and a half.
[00:36:32.258 --> 00:36:45.668]  Image stabilized a lot of the video, color corrected it, you know, the hidden camera really souped it up because we've got new computers now that can really clean up the image and really bring out the ritual and really zoom in to point-blank range.
[00:36:46.818 --> 00:36:48.159]  Just so much new stuff.
[00:36:48.299 --> 00:36:52.684]  Up close video of the effigy, the human body, the image of a child they're burning.
[00:36:55.267 --> 00:36:59.992]  We've got this new fella that worked there for two years and gave us all this video.
[00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:00.953]  Wait till you see it.
[00:37:01.273 --> 00:37:03.736]  We put some of that into the original Bohemian Grove film.
[00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:08.053]  And so we're going to have one final showing.
[00:37:08.073 --> 00:37:09.054]  You know, they asked me to do it.
[00:37:09.074 --> 00:37:20.787]  I had the theater manager, the Alamo Draft House South Lamar, their new beautiful theater with the big giant theaters with the huge stadium seatings and waiters and waitresses right there at your table, folks.
[00:37:20.827 --> 00:37:21.468]  It's really nice.
[00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:25.312]  And they said, please, one more showing, one more showing.
[00:37:25.936 --> 00:37:26.977]  Because, I mean, I'm busy.
[00:37:28.398 --> 00:37:34.943]  Because I'm trying to finish this other film about going to England and what happened at Crawford and a bunch of other stuff, a bunch of other footage we've got.
[00:37:35.543 --> 00:37:36.324]  An amazing video.
[00:37:36.364 --> 00:37:37.544]  The problem is I've got so much video.
[00:37:37.564 --> 00:37:39.986]  I'm trying to make this be like a 90-minute film.
[00:37:40.887 --> 00:37:42.028]  And it's just crazy.
[00:37:42.108 --> 00:37:48.793]  But I am having one more showing, and that is going to be this Thursday.
[00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:53.216]  This Thursday, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:58.346]  And in the past, we've had, what, six showings of martial law.
[00:37:58.747 --> 00:38:00.288]  All of them sold out days in advance.
[00:38:01.468 --> 00:38:03.410]  The last two showings sold out days in advance.
[00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.991]  So I haven't really promoted this one.
[00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:08.012]  And so there are a ton of tickets left.
[00:38:09.233 --> 00:38:11.695]  In fact, the way it's selling, there will probably even be some tickets left.
[00:38:12.075 --> 00:38:12.956]  Maybe.
[00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:13.356]  I doubt it.
[00:38:13.376 --> 00:38:13.676]  I don't know.
[00:38:13.696 --> 00:38:15.597]  You know, the day of the event.
[00:38:15.617 --> 00:38:16.538]  But I wouldn't do that.
[00:38:18.038 --> 00:38:18.739]  I wouldn't wait.
[00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:20.520]  It's a great event.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.381]  You get to see all the great people that love freedom.
[00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:23.462]  We all get to get together.
[00:38:23.482 --> 00:38:27.545]  I'll be there with my books and videos and t-shirts, signing them if you so desire.
[00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:31.849]  And I'll give a speech, and I'll also take a question and answer.
[00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:42.957]  So we're going to show the order of death, and nobody's going to see this until, I mean, you'll be the first to see it, other than myself and Rob Jacobson that I've been editing this with, doing a great job.
[00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:50.545]  And then we'll show the Bohemian Grove Dark Secrets that we finished last night.
[00:38:52.125 --> 00:39:06.452]  And 35 minutes of Dark Secrets has been cut out, but if you want the original, that I'm only going to be offering for another two weeks or so, a two-hour, five-minute Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:39:06.492 --> 00:39:08.152]  It's only available on VHS.
[00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:11.714]  And when it's gone, it's gone.
[00:39:13.169 --> 00:39:25.320]  When the new DVD comes out, it's going to have Order of Death and Dark Secrets on it, the new Order of Death, the new version of Bohemian Grove, I will never offer again the original Bohemian Grove video.
[00:39:26.982 --> 00:39:28.323]  So get the new one.
[00:39:29.804 --> 00:39:32.166]  Get the new one now, my friends.
[00:39:32.226 --> 00:39:32.487]  Get it.
[00:39:35.177 --> 00:39:38.480]  Get the old one now while you still can before the new one comes out.
[00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:46.828]  And go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:39:46.848 --> 00:39:49.370]  Get the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:57.798]  And I'm signing, which gives us a lot of collector's value, I'm signing every one that goes out in the next two weeks until we stop offering it.
[00:39:58.866 --> 00:40:03.528]  I'm signing the spine of the VHS videotape of everyone that goes out.
[00:40:04.028 --> 00:40:05.449]  And I'm kind of sentimental about it.
[00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:09.611]  I'm sorry I've already shot my mouth off and said I'm not going to offer it anymore, but I'm not.
[00:40:10.311 --> 00:40:12.392]  It's like 9-11 emergency release.
[00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:15.534]  Remember that that I made in like a week, two weeks after 9-11?
[00:40:17.695 --> 00:40:20.036]  It was a two-hour video, and people said, man, it's a great video.
[00:40:20.556 --> 00:40:21.256]  Keep offering it.
[00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:22.997]  No, I've never offered it.
[00:40:23.757 --> 00:40:25.299]  You know, it's on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:29.586]  For prisonplanet.tv members, it's there on the Internet, but not in hard copy format.
[00:40:30.367 --> 00:40:30.727]  And so...
[00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:40.597]  Again, if you want Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the original collector's edition, signed, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:40:41.058 --> 00:40:45.681]  That's InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:26.387]  And the original film, of course, can live on by all you great listeners out there making copies of it.
[00:41:29.551 --> 00:41:34.273]  So you can still get the original film and get it and make copies and get it out to everybody, your friends and family.
[00:41:34.573 --> 00:41:35.934]  It's having a massive effect.
[00:41:36.014 --> 00:41:40.236]  Please continue to air it on local cable systems around the country on AXS TV.
[00:41:40.616 --> 00:41:42.497]  Please continue to show it at your churches.
[00:41:43.297 --> 00:41:49.120]  And also you can get Martial Law, my new film, the miniseries, the tailing 9-11, the police state, the Nazi death cults.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.261]  You've got to get American Dictators.
[00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:53.782]  And I haven't plugged this.
[00:41:55.002 --> 00:41:56.143]  I really haven't plugged this.
[00:41:56.543 --> 00:41:58.264]  We've got a bunch of new specials.
[00:41:58.866 --> 00:42:02.949]  Three DVDs, American Dictators, Martial Law, and Road to Tyranny.
[00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.192]  All three of those films for $44.95.
[00:42:08.653 --> 00:42:07.192]  $45.
[00:42:09.874 --> 00:42:15.738]  I mean, that is just a huge discount, folks.
[00:42:16.658 --> 00:42:17.939]  Think about it.
[00:42:17.979 --> 00:42:18.820]  They're normally $25.95.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.522]  You get three of those for $45 right now.
[00:42:23.343 --> 00:42:24.264]  To be precise, $44.95.
[00:42:27.113 --> 00:42:28.534]  Well, that's a psychological trick.
[00:42:28.574 --> 00:42:29.635]  I like to point that out.
[00:42:30.216 --> 00:42:31.057]  Notice that's marketing.
[00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:34.260]  I've always had round numbers just to illustrate that.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.040]  But you know what?
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.423]  If it'll make people buy it and get the word out and defeat the New World Order, fine.
[00:42:38.463 --> 00:42:38.564]  It's $44.95.
[00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:44.229]  See, that's an example of semantical manipulation, folks.
[00:42:44.809 --> 00:42:48.993]  That if something's a cent or five cents less, oh, it's less.
[00:42:49.013 --> 00:42:49.133]  It's $44.
[00:42:49.354 --> 00:42:49.694]  It's not $45.
[00:42:53.396 --> 00:42:55.817]  But the point is, $45, three of those.
[00:42:55.917 --> 00:42:58.438]  I've got the everything special where you get everything I've made.
[00:42:58.458 --> 00:43:01.540]  I think it's like a third off or something ridiculous.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.241]  I don't have all the prices in front of me.
[00:43:03.461 --> 00:43:06.082]  Just go to Infowars.com or call the toll-free number.
[00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:09.283]  There's like six or seven new specials.
[00:43:09.363 --> 00:43:14.006]  All the old specials are still up there, but these new specials will only be to the first of the year.
[00:43:14.326 --> 00:43:14.826]  Guarantee it.
[00:43:15.868 --> 00:43:21.792]  1-888-253-3139 if you want to call about those specials, too.
[00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:22.953]  All right, that's enough.
[00:43:23.013 --> 00:43:29.857]  Let's play this little clip to analyze the CNN piece about impending indictments in the White House and what will happen.
[00:43:30.558 --> 00:43:32.959]  Let's go ahead and roll that CNN piece.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:40.864]  President Bush insists background noise about the CIA leak investigation isn't keeping him from doing his job.
[00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:41.905]  A lot of chatter.
[00:43:43.616 --> 00:43:45.738]  A lot of speculation.
[00:43:46.159 --> 00:43:48.681]  That noise could get much louder this week.
[00:43:48.921 --> 00:44:02.955]  The grand jury's term expires Friday, and inside the White House there is anxiety over whether the president's top political advisor, Carl Rove, the vice president's chief of staff, Louis Scooter Libby, or any other key official will be indicted.
[00:44:05.157 --> 00:44:15.067]  Fitzgerald launched a website which included a Justice Department letter confirming the parameters of his investigation, a list that includes perjury and obstruction of justice.
[00:44:15.578 --> 00:44:19.499]  I think that's an ominous development for those people who have been targeted by the grand jury.
[00:44:19.539 --> 00:44:22.960]  You don't open up a website if you're ready to shut down an investigation.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.580]  At the same time, the president is facing a host of challenges on other fronts.
[00:44:28.241 --> 00:44:33.542]  In two weeks, his Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Myers, goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:44:33.622 --> 00:44:39.043]  Some conservatives have blasted Myers as unqualified and want her nomination pulled.
[00:44:39.323 --> 00:44:41.003]  I feel the president's nominated her.
[00:44:41.623 --> 00:44:43.344]  He said that he's not going to withdraw her.
[00:44:43.364 --> 00:44:44.564]  I take him at his word.
[00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.678]  It makes the hearing the most important thing.
[00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:52.803]  Add to the White House difficulties the approach of a grim milestone in the Iraq War.
[00:44:53.263 --> 00:44:55.425]  The number of Americans who died is nearing 2,000.
[00:44:56.146 --> 00:45:00.770]  And polls show waning public support for the President's Iraq policy.
[00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:01.711]  All right.
[00:45:03.232 --> 00:45:08.437]  So there you have the basic demonization now of Bush and this big...
[00:45:10.223 --> 00:45:11.724]  Eat, drink, and be merry revelry.
[00:45:11.905 --> 00:45:14.927]  Oh, we're slaying the dragon, the evil political monster.
[00:45:15.307 --> 00:45:18.890]  They're a client group of technicians in there to do a job.
[00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:31.681]  This is an imperial tactic to then walk all over them, use them as a doormat, act like the entire agenda that the people hate was their fault.
[00:45:32.102 --> 00:45:33.343]  Then they get in trouble.
[00:45:33.383 --> 00:45:34.524]  They're publicly shamed.
[00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:37.106]  They fall on their swords.
[00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:42.515]  And the establishment's agenda just moves forward.
[00:45:43.355 --> 00:45:45.717]  I mean, let's talk about reversals of the policies.
[00:45:45.737 --> 00:45:51.842]  You know, if Bush is so unpopular, but no, the very people out demonizing Bush, even the Democrats, well, you have to stay the course in Iraq.
[00:45:52.163 --> 00:45:54.224]  Well, you have to maybe go into Syria and Iran.
[00:45:54.244 --> 00:46:03.873]  I mean, Hillary sounds like she's right of Bush now, positioning herself in the false paradigm for the run that's coming up here in about three years.
[00:46:05.514 --> 00:46:06.575]  The election will start in two.
[00:46:08.717 --> 00:46:11.639]  The warm-up for that is two years away, folks.
[00:46:11.819 --> 00:46:13.400]  We'll be right in the middle of the election in two years.
[00:46:15.821 --> 00:46:19.922]  It's all about keeping us in our two camps to switch off the thinking process.
[00:46:20.883 --> 00:46:23.384]  To make sure we've all got our Republican or Democratic caps on.
[00:46:24.544 --> 00:46:27.946]  And, by the way, if you die in the combat zone, it counts.
[00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:31.068]  We've had 2,000 die in the combat zone.
[00:46:31.629 --> 00:46:33.551]  It was well over 8,000 a year ago.
[00:46:33.571 --> 00:46:35.312]  I mean, mainstream numbers that have come out.
[00:46:35.633 --> 00:46:40.678]  People that died being evac'd out, died on the helicopter, died of complications from their wounds.
[00:46:41.038 --> 00:46:42.019]  That doesn't count.
[00:46:42.819 --> 00:46:48.580]  And I haven't seen the numbers in the last few months, but it's over 8,000, and what is it, like 16,000 injured?
[00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:49.801]  Severely.
[00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:51.681]  I mean, we're not talking about little scratches.
[00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:55.742]  We mean 16,000-plus purple hearts have been handed out.
[00:46:56.402 --> 00:46:57.382]  Arms, legs blown off.
[00:46:57.402 --> 00:47:00.643]  Folks, I'm in Circuit City.
[00:47:00.863 --> 00:47:02.624]  I'm in Comp USA.
[00:47:02.764 --> 00:47:03.004]  I'm in...
[00:47:04.545 --> 00:47:06.145]  Business stores.
[00:47:06.546 --> 00:47:08.646]  I'm in Target, and I see these guys working.
[00:47:08.986 --> 00:47:13.347]  They've still got the little shaved heads, and both their legs are blown off, or an arm's blown off.
[00:47:13.788 --> 00:47:17.148]  I've seen a guy with an arm and a leg blown off, and I've actually walked over and talked to him.
[00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:18.729]  Did you just get back?
[00:47:18.789 --> 00:47:21.069]  And the guys all look real sad.
[00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.790]  They're already working, folks, and they've still got bandages.
[00:47:24.831 --> 00:47:27.511]  You can look and see the little yellow seepage.
[00:47:27.531 --> 00:47:28.852]  You can tell they're still seeping.
[00:47:29.312 --> 00:47:31.612]  Their wounds haven't even healed, folks.
[00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:33.373]  Their limbs haven't even grown back.
[00:47:36.608 --> 00:47:37.648]  They're still raw.
[00:47:38.409 --> 00:47:43.451]  I mean, I look at the bandages on them, and you can still see the yellow coming through, the blood coming through, the plasma coming through.
[00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:45.892]  They still are bleeding.
[00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:51.415]  I mean, these guys must be already going back on the job a month after their arms and legs are blown off.
[00:47:52.155 --> 00:47:52.995]  Poor things.
[00:47:54.036 --> 00:48:01.279]  And it's all for a lie for a bunch of carpet-bagging, draft-dodging, sniveling neocons.
[00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:03.060]  It's just so sick.
[00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:05.602]  And it just makes me sick.
[00:48:06.923 --> 00:48:08.664]  Let's go ahead and go to Pat in Ohio.
[00:48:08.704 --> 00:48:09.604]  Pat, thanks for holding.
[00:48:09.944 --> 00:48:10.244]  Welcome.
[00:48:10.925 --> 00:48:11.645]  Yeah, how you doing?
[00:48:12.246 --> 00:48:12.666]  Good.
[00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:16.828]  Before I ask my question, you mentioned that Johnny Cash was Jimmy Swagger's cousin?
[00:48:17.368 --> 00:48:17.609]  Yes.
[00:48:17.649 --> 00:48:22.231]  Back in the mid-80s, I heard him say that Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley were his first cousins.
[00:48:22.251 --> 00:48:24.392]  You never mentioned Johnny Cash.
[00:48:25.113 --> 00:48:26.293]  Okay, well, that's the truth.
[00:48:26.754 --> 00:48:27.034]  Okay.
[00:48:27.974 --> 00:48:32.397]  My first question was, on one of your tapes, I think you...
[00:48:33.928 --> 00:48:36.089]  And George Humphrey mentioned Flight 800.
[00:48:37.909 --> 00:48:39.790]  And you never elaborated on that.
[00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:43.171]  And I think that was the flight that went down a few years ago?
[00:48:43.191 --> 00:48:44.051]  Yeah.
[00:48:44.071 --> 00:48:50.632]  They said the Navy accidentally, or some speculation was that the Navy shot a rocket up there or something like that.
[00:48:50.692 --> 00:48:52.053]  Is that the one we're talking about?
[00:48:52.093 --> 00:48:52.413]  Yes.
[00:48:52.953 --> 00:48:55.314]  It blew up taking off from New York flying to Europe.
[00:48:56.154 --> 00:49:00.335]  That plane, the Army was on maneuvers, the Navy was on maneuvers.
[00:49:01.453 --> 00:49:09.400]  Over 400 military men saw it, including over 40-something people who were Vietnam vets who'd seen missile trails.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.562]  Not one, but two missiles hit it.
[00:49:11.902 --> 00:49:13.003]  State police saw it.
[00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:13.804]  Police saw it.
[00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:17.607]  There were over 800 witnesses that signed affidavits, like 800-plus.
[00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:28.627]  And so it was seen by 800-plus witnesses, including masses of them that were in helicopters, who were Vietnam vets, who saw the missiles, clearly hit it.
[00:49:29.128 --> 00:49:30.669]  And so we don't know what happened.
[00:49:31.029 --> 00:49:33.571]  We just know that they tested the residue in the plane.
[00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:37.814]  Some reporters snuck in and got it, and they got indicted for getting the residue.
[00:49:38.494 --> 00:49:40.015]  It was explosive residue.
[00:49:40.816 --> 00:49:43.117]  We know that the plane was shot down.
[00:49:43.197 --> 00:49:43.998]  We don't know why.
[00:49:44.258 --> 00:49:45.679]  We just know the government lied about it.
[00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:53.992]  Just like the Queens, New York flight that took off from Queens a few weeks after 9-11 and both engines blew off and the tail blew off.
[00:49:54.012 --> 00:49:56.813]  We got firemen, police, everybody seeing it.
[00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.853]  And they just say, nope, you didn't see that.
[00:50:00.894 --> 00:50:02.274]  Okay.
[00:50:02.314 --> 00:50:05.615]  So I don't begin to say what happened or why it happened.
[00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:06.876]  We just know they're lying about it.
[00:50:07.316 --> 00:50:07.536]  Right.
[00:50:07.756 --> 00:50:08.336]  Okay.
[00:50:08.456 --> 00:50:09.276]  I wonder about that.
[00:50:09.996 --> 00:50:15.898]  And also when you mentioned, when I looked at your tape,
[00:50:16.793 --> 00:50:21.456]  You know, the federal building in Oklahoma and the two towers that went down.
[00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:23.217]  Yeah, we know specifically what happened with that.
[00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:25.478]  Right, but my question is... The feds blew it up.
[00:50:26.038 --> 00:50:27.959]  Yeah, but what I don't understand, why lie about it?
[00:50:27.979 --> 00:50:31.621]  Why don't they just say that the terrorists blew it up?
[00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:35.543]  Why stop there with just that they blew into the building?
[00:50:35.563 --> 00:50:43.528]  Why not, instead of covering up the fact that the buildings were blown up, they had explosives underneath the building, why not just tell the people that they also...
[00:50:45.758 --> 00:50:50.641]  Because, ma'am, that takes engineers with three degrees months to do.
[00:50:51.242 --> 00:50:51.742]  That's why.
[00:50:51.762 --> 00:50:53.243]  Because it's pure bull.
[00:50:53.263 --> 00:50:54.644]  The whole story's pure bull.
[00:50:55.104 --> 00:50:55.845]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.865 --> 00:50:56.245]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.907 --> 00:51:05.768]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:51:20.015 --> 00:51:21.995]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.196 --> 00:51:25.056]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.136 --> 00:51:29.817]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.997 --> 00:51:34.438]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:41.840]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.521]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:58.103 --> 00:53:00.484]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:54:13.473 --> 00:54:21.995]  We've got General Hannah Skarpinski, the only female general officer commanding troops in the combat zone of Iraq, joining us to try to scapegoat her.
[00:54:22.055 --> 00:54:23.815]  Now she's blown the whistle big time.
[00:54:24.755 --> 00:54:27.075]  People say, you know, they couldn't run a conspiracy this big.
[00:54:27.115 --> 00:54:28.016]  People would go public.
[00:54:28.856 --> 00:54:35.517]  How many FBI agents, how many former top CIA analysts, how many congressmen do we have to have on?
[00:54:35.537 --> 00:54:41.598]  I mean, I have the guy that briefed Ronald Reagan for six of his eight years, the guy that briefed
[00:54:42.156 --> 00:54:46.740]  George Bush Sr., for all of his years, Ray McGovern on it.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.001]  I didn't prompt him.
[00:54:48.061 --> 00:54:52.225]  I just said, what do you think is going to happen if this administration gets in trouble?
[00:54:52.545 --> 00:54:54.727]  Oh, they could carry out terror attacks.
[00:54:56.388 --> 00:54:57.449]  Do you understand?
[00:54:57.689 --> 00:55:01.613]  That top CIA analyst, number five in the CIA when he was in the CIA.
[00:55:02.995 --> 00:55:08.461]  Ray McGovern saying, the government may carry out terror attacks.
[00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:09.282]  Let me say it again.
[00:55:09.622 --> 00:55:13.887]  He said, the government might carry out terror attacks.
[00:55:15.248 --> 00:55:17.030]  Of course, I've talked to him off camera before.
[00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.873]  I've interviewed him for TV, and he even said that on TV.
[00:55:19.913 --> 00:55:20.954]  It's an upcoming documentary.
[00:55:22.195 --> 00:55:25.639]  We've already put it in weekly TV reports for the Prison Planet.TV members, but...
[00:55:27.748 --> 00:55:30.150]  You know, he said the government could carry out a tax then.
[00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:31.791]  Do you understand?
[00:55:32.352 --> 00:55:34.253]  See, this is mainstream.
[00:55:34.433 --> 00:55:36.135]  This is what analysts are saying.
[00:55:36.395 --> 00:55:38.357]  This is the reality.
[00:55:38.617 --> 00:55:41.139]  We have government documents where they plan to do it.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.541]  You cannot ignore it.
[00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:44.682]  It is real.
[00:55:44.962 --> 00:55:49.045]  You can keep saying that we're the kooks, but you are the kooks that deny this.
[00:55:49.566 --> 00:55:50.586]  Do you understand?
[00:55:50.887 --> 00:55:52.428]  There's one way to look at the data.
[00:55:52.968 --> 00:55:53.709]  Only one way.
[00:55:54.249 --> 00:55:56.071]  It is an orgy of evidence.
[00:55:57.513 --> 00:56:01.277]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[00:56:01.377 --> 00:56:02.018]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:56:02.558 --> 00:56:03.339]  Hello, my friend.
[00:56:03.379 --> 00:56:03.899]  How are you?
[00:56:04.039 --> 00:56:05.000]  Good, my friend.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.564]  I'm enjoying a nice Cuban Cohiba as we speak.
[00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:16.351]  I just wanted to tell you that I purchased a shortwave radio because where I am in Rochester, I cannot pick up the AM signal.
[00:56:16.911 --> 00:56:20.975]  I believe that strongly in your message, so I spent 200 hours on a shortwave radio.
[00:56:21.724 --> 00:56:24.965]  Well, I'm sorry to hear you can't pick up our great affiliates up there, but we appreciate them, too.
[00:56:24.985 --> 00:56:25.626]  What's on your mind?
[00:56:25.866 --> 00:56:28.287]  Oh, my friend, I'll tell you, I've got to run.
[00:56:28.407 --> 00:56:34.189]  I sell law enforcement and military supplies, and I've got some good stories to tell you, but I'll have to call back in.
[00:56:34.209 --> 00:56:36.310]  I just ran out of time.
[00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:38.090]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:40.273]  Well, tell us 30 seconds of it.
[00:56:40.493 --> 00:56:41.014]  I'll tell you.
[00:56:41.074 --> 00:56:55.810]  You know, the other day I had this woman call, and her son, he's an MP over there, and she's crying because he can't find a sling for his M16, and he needs a holster for his sidearm.
[00:56:56.552 --> 00:57:04.214]  And here I'm thinking to myself, here she's crying on the phone, and you can't put people over there without giving them the tools to do the job.
[00:57:04.734 --> 00:57:07.835]  Half the army that was in the news had to buy their own body armor.
[00:57:08.595 --> 00:57:10.676]  Alex, it breaks my heart when I get these calls.
[00:57:11.076 --> 00:57:14.197]  It just breaks my heart.
[00:57:14.217 --> 00:57:17.497]  I said, look, I have the stuff that you're looking for.
[00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:19.738]  I'll send it to you, and I won't charge you a penny.
[00:57:20.478 --> 00:57:22.839]  Just so your kid has got some things that he needs.
[00:57:23.219 --> 00:57:23.439]  Good.
[00:57:23.499 --> 00:57:25.160]  We need to get you as a sponsor.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.601]  We need an Army-Navy supplier.
[00:57:28.021 --> 00:57:30.483]  You know, I'm not really looking for sponsors, but I should be.
[00:57:30.503 --> 00:57:31.423]  Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:57:31.563 --> 00:57:32.504]  Send me some info.
[00:57:32.664 --> 00:57:33.944]  Well, you're the right kind of person.
[00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:38.006]  Well, can you believe they won't give them armored vehicles that they keep saying they have when they haven't?
[00:57:38.306 --> 00:57:38.966]  Alex, I can't.
[00:57:39.607 --> 00:57:40.147]  I can't.
[00:57:40.287 --> 00:57:41.468]  I get so infuriated.
[00:57:41.528 --> 00:57:43.689]  I get so enraged when I hear this nonsense.
[00:57:44.149 --> 00:57:44.889]  It's incredible.
[00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:46.510]  The people have to wake up.
[00:57:47.045 --> 00:57:54.832]  You know, my sons and I collect firearms, and I told them, I said, you really need to listen to this guy because if you want to keep that investment, you really need to hear what you have to say.
[00:57:55.452 --> 00:58:00.156]  And, you know, I'll tell you, it's an important message that needs to be heard.
[00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:06.742]  And these people who choose to ignore it, I can't, I don't understand what they're thinking about.
[00:58:07.263 --> 00:58:07.843]  I really don't.
[00:58:08.424 --> 00:58:12.027]  You know, there's so many things that you're saying need to be heard.
[00:58:13.854 --> 00:58:16.316]  Well, God bless you, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:58:16.396 --> 00:58:17.137]  And call me back.
[00:58:17.157 --> 00:58:18.258]  I want to hear more of the stories.
[00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:20.779]  Mike, you still there?
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.741]  But I will call you again, my friend.
[00:58:22.881 --> 00:58:25.743]  Yeah, call me back when we've got more time, when you don't have somebody to score or whatever.
[00:58:25.783 --> 00:58:26.584]  Thank you very much.
[00:58:26.604 --> 00:58:26.904]  You bet.
[00:58:26.924 --> 00:58:27.284]  Take care.
[00:58:27.344 --> 00:58:27.905]  Bye, Candias.
[00:58:27.925 --> 00:58:30.667]  All right, we'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:31.487]  Take a few more calls.
[00:58:32.188 --> 00:58:40.454]  And then we've got Janice Alpinski joining us, the only female officer commanding troops in the combat zone in Iraq.
[00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.513]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.813 --> 00:58:46.614]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.714 --> 00:58:58.355]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.015 --> 00:59:00.096]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.776 --> 00:59:01.917]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:03.378]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.119 --> 00:59:06.040]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.863 --> 00:59:13.986]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.467 --> 00:59:19.690]  Well, she was the commanding general of all the prisons and detention centers.
[00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.531]  I bet she's got some stories to tell.
[00:59:22.271 --> 00:59:24.953]  In Iraq, she was General Janice Berpinski.
[00:59:25.314 --> 00:59:27.035]  She's joining us in about five minutes.
[00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:31.609]  The only female general officer commanding troops in the combat zone in Iraq.
[00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:33.591]  And they tried to scapegoat her.
[00:59:34.312 --> 00:59:34.953]  That's coming up.
[00:59:35.113 --> 00:59:35.994]  Also, your calls.
[00:59:36.174 --> 00:59:37.655]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[00:59:38.316 --> 00:59:41.639]  Scott Ritter, the UN weapons inspector, with a bunch of new revelations and developments.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.322]  Another big whistleblower joining us in the next hour.
[00:59:46.003 --> 00:59:48.345]  Let's go to Joel in Wisconsin right now.
[00:59:48.425 --> 00:59:49.086]  Joel, welcome.
[00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:50.421]  Hi, Alex.
[00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:55.342]  I wanted to go over a few things, like the Fed chair being changed.
[00:59:55.722 --> 00:59:59.723]  I know Alan Greenspan said that the gold-backed dollar is the best thing.
[01:00:00.183 --> 01:00:03.343]  Then when he gets in, all of a sudden, oh, no, no, no.
[01:00:03.363 --> 01:00:05.624]  Well, he wrote books saying the Federal Reserve is an evil.
[01:00:05.704 --> 01:00:09.064]  He wrote books that sounded like they were written by Eustace Mullins.
[01:00:09.404 --> 01:00:09.644]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:09.804 --> 01:00:12.325]  I mean, these are published in Ayn Rand publications in the 60s.
[01:00:13.445 --> 01:00:15.866]  But by the 70s, he switched over to their side.
[01:00:15.886 --> 01:00:18.266]  They actually paid him off and hired him.
[01:00:18.286 --> 01:00:18.506]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.282]  I mean, he was one of us, folks.
[01:00:20.302 --> 01:00:21.282]  He talked just like us.
[01:00:21.522 --> 01:00:22.583]  I'm going to make a prediction.
[01:00:22.883 --> 01:00:30.344]  I'm going to predict that interest rates are going to rise through the roof, that this new chairman is going to burst the housing bubble for sure.
[01:00:30.804 --> 01:00:32.844]  And what they're doing is they're using the hurricane.
[01:00:33.565 --> 01:00:41.006]  And did you know, just in the past half day or so, there's been a bombing that went off in Baghdad again.
[01:00:41.546 --> 01:00:47.727]  But the terrorists are blowing up reporters.
[01:00:48.413 --> 01:00:50.843]  Now I couldn't think of any terrorist
[01:00:51.331 --> 01:00:53.693]  Well, why would they want bad press releases?
[01:00:53.713 --> 01:00:54.794]  I mean, what
[01:01:19.437 --> 01:01:20.518]  I'm looking at it this way.
[01:01:20.738 --> 01:01:31.066]  The government, if some reporter got a hold of some really hot news that was, like, meltdown great, I would think that the government would want them hushed up really quick.
[01:01:31.366 --> 01:01:32.707]  But I don't think terrorists would.
[01:01:32.747 --> 01:01:35.930]  Well, sir, it's not just your logic that's correct.
[01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:37.231]  It's the facts.
[01:01:37.671 --> 01:01:46.458]  You notice the Spanish judge has indicted and is calling for the arrest of the troops that fired with the Abrams into the hotel?
[01:01:47.365 --> 01:01:48.226]  I think we're good to go.
[01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:08.533]  They openly are targeting reporters.
[01:02:08.913 --> 01:02:10.574]  It's like in the Associated Press.
[01:02:11.135 --> 01:02:15.518]  They had major reporters, a big gaggle of them, had an officer walk over to them.
[01:02:15.538 --> 01:02:19.121]  Remember this a few weeks ago in New Orleans?
[01:02:19.642 --> 01:02:24.125]  And he said, I don't care if the federal court says you're allowed to take photos and be here.
[01:02:24.486 --> 01:02:29.430]  You release one photo of any of this, we are going to kill you like we do people in Iraq.
[01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:31.471]  Now, that's in front of reporters.
[01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:33.932]  That's not us claiming they kill reporters.
[01:02:34.112 --> 01:02:35.933]  That's them saying, we kill you.
[01:02:36.233 --> 01:02:37.374]  We will kill you.
[01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:42.956]  In America, troops saying, an officer right in front of a whole group of reporters, knowing it'd get out.
[01:02:43.777 --> 01:02:44.237]  We will kill you.
[01:02:44.257 --> 01:02:48.519]  I think they're using Mears as a lightning rod, because I don't think she's electable.
[01:02:48.879 --> 01:02:53.861]  But I do think that the next person they put in is going to be even worse, but it's going to be the other side.
[01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:54.922]  So...
[01:02:56.055 --> 01:02:59.780]  We'll be okay if I listen off air to the interview.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.942]  Sir, we can't let people sit on the phone line.
[01:03:01.962 --> 01:03:03.104]  I do appreciate your call.
[01:03:03.564 --> 01:03:05.547]  I mean, I really, really do appreciate your call, sir.
[01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:11.113]  You can listen on shortwave, on the Internet, if you don't have a local AM or FM affiliate, up in Wisconsin.
[01:03:11.514 --> 01:03:15.659]  I suggest for all of you who don't have an AM or FM affiliate, you're listening on shortwave on the Internet.
[01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:21.333]  On bad shortwave days or bad internet days, whatever, call and get us a local affiliate in your area.
[01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:24.856]  That's how we get most of our stations, and we're getting more of them.
[01:03:25.356 --> 01:03:26.597]  I want to thank all those stations.
[01:03:27.878 --> 01:03:30.601]  It's that people just keep calling and calling and calling.
[01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:31.641]  We want Alex Jones.
[01:03:32.022 --> 01:03:32.982]  We want Alex Jones.
[01:03:33.503 --> 01:03:34.584]  We want Alex Jones.
[01:03:35.284 --> 01:03:38.027]  And they've got the receivers to pick us up.
[01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:39.748]  We're on the big digital birds, folks.
[01:03:40.569 --> 01:03:44.692]  And pretty much everybody in radio now knows who I am, so it's not that hard of a sell.
[01:03:45.598 --> 01:03:49.060]  We're getting pretty mainstream in that everything we've talked about is coming out.
[01:03:53.303 --> 01:03:54.824]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.004 --> 01:03:58.086]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.226 --> 01:04:02.128]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.169 --> 01:04:06.411]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:10.534]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:12.395]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.675 --> 01:04:15.958]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:20.722]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.863 --> 01:04:23.925]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.085 --> 01:04:26.988]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:33.574]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.094 --> 01:04:34.594]  We're good to go.
[01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:59.608]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.949 --> 01:05:04.031]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:04.891]  We listened.
[01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:10.174]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.454 --> 01:05:10.934]  We listened.
[01:05:11.314 --> 01:05:14.356]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.776 --> 01:05:15.316]  We listened.
[01:05:15.777 --> 01:05:18.458]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.181]  We're good to go.
[01:05:21.201 --> 01:05:21.381]  I think?
[01:05:45.679 --> 01:05:46.681]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:46.701 --> 01:05:48.324]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.772 --> 01:05:59.414]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[01:05:59.574 --> 01:06:05.576]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your game without even trying.
[01:06:05.596 --> 01:06:09.337]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder products.
[01:06:09.377 --> 01:06:10.618]  We've all had enough of those.
[01:06:10.838 --> 01:06:13.559]  I'm talking about God's pure whole food.
[01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:16.399]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[01:06:16.499 --> 01:06:21.101]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the experience.
[01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:22.982]  Don't wait any longer to look and feel your best.

[01:06:54.438 --> 01:07:00.463]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:04.046]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:08.552]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[01:07:08.612 --> 01:07:10.853]  We wage war on corruption.
[01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:19.138]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, Central Standard Time, blasting out across the country on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on the internet.
[01:07:19.839 --> 01:07:22.941]  Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[01:07:23.361 --> 01:07:26.663]  We've got Scott Ritter coming on in the next hour.
[01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:32.522]  Just a lot of new revelations, and he's spilt his guts in this new book.
[01:07:32.642 --> 01:07:36.305]  Stuff that you've never seen in the press, you've never heard before.
[01:07:37.446 --> 01:07:40.149]  Everything's so well documented that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:44.773]  And everything he has told us, he's been completely vindicated.
[01:07:46.114 --> 01:07:47.615]  Just totally vindicated.
[01:07:47.635 --> 01:07:54.541]  And he has been through the ringer at the hands of the frothing, treasonous neocons.
[01:07:55.658 --> 01:08:17.848]  But for the next 51 minutes, and we're even going to take some calls a little bit later, we are joined by the Brigadier General, retired now, and she was the head of all the prisons and detainment facilities, 17 of them at the time, in Iraq, 3,400 soldiers, and she's Janice Karpinski.
[01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:21.370]  And when she started refusing to be scapegoated...
[01:08:22.443 --> 01:08:34.887]  I started pointing out the military intelligence and the 205 Military Intelligence Brigade was in control of every wing in every prison where this stuff was going on, where the torture was going on.
[01:08:35.868 --> 01:08:51.373]  When she wouldn't fall on her sword and commit Harry Caray when she hadn't done anything, Lord Bush, the Silver Spoon creature, fell on, basically forced her to be broken down to a colonel.
[01:08:52.367 --> 01:08:54.169]  And it just makes me so angry.
[01:08:54.649 --> 01:09:01.715]  And she's written a new book, and we're going to tell you about it, One Woman's Army, and it's in most finer bookstores now.
[01:09:01.735 --> 01:09:07.820]  We'll tell you how to get it online at Amazon.com and more about the book as she now joins us.
[01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:12.264]  And General, it's really good to have you on with us today.
[01:09:12.764 --> 01:09:14.085]  And it is great to be with you.
[01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:14.786]  It's a privilege.
[01:09:14.886 --> 01:09:15.667]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:16.437 --> 01:09:19.838]  For those that don't know, I mean, we have General Tugumbu's own report.
[01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:20.978]  I mean, it's admitted.
[01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:24.199]  Raping, pouring acid on people.
[01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:26.919]  The photos we've seen are the tip of the iceberg.
[01:09:26.999 --> 01:09:36.301]  But then, day one, I knew that even at Camp X-Ray, Brigadier General Rick Baucus refused to torture, so he got kicked out as well.
[01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:38.321]  So you're among a lot of other company.
[01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:42.802]  And now that's finally broken on major TV shows like Frontline.
[01:09:43.382 --> 01:09:45.043]  But we reported on it two years ago.
[01:09:47.068 --> 01:09:47.989]  I mean, this is going on.
[01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:56.594]  For those that don't know, the torture is admitted, but we know that even in Guantanamo Bay, there is a CIA base within the base.
[01:09:56.974 --> 01:09:58.255]  That's where the torture goes on.
[01:09:58.635 --> 01:10:04.459]  And can you break this down and basically go through what happened and how they tried to scapegoat you?
[01:10:04.919 --> 01:10:09.722]  Well, I guess we'll never know until they're willing to admit, and they never will.
[01:10:09.802 --> 01:10:15.065]  But we can speculate as to why they wanted to scapegoat me, and there's every reason to believe...
[01:10:16.723 --> 01:10:18.104]  That those reasons are valid.
[01:10:18.184 --> 01:10:23.545]  But it started when we were assigned this new mission for detention operations.
[01:10:23.945 --> 01:10:26.046]  We were basically sold a false bill of goods.
[01:10:26.086 --> 01:10:41.950]  They told us that we were going to Baghdad, that we were going to receive support from the CJTF7, General Sanchez's headquarters, and from Ambassador Bremer at the Coalition Provisional Authority, that we would be working with these prisons experts at the Coalition Provisional Authority.
[01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:47.815]  To work towards restoring Iraqi jails and prisons to turn it back over to the Iraqi control.
[01:10:49.076 --> 01:10:54.338]  To arrive in Baghdad to discover that they had just begun to identify some locations.
[01:10:54.398 --> 01:11:00.982]  They had a list of 121 prisons that they wanted to restore and that they wanted us to run.
[01:11:01.002 --> 01:11:04.464]  And I told them I didn't have nearly that number of resources.
[01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:05.284]  I could run about 15.
[01:11:05.384 --> 01:11:06.065]  We settled on 17.
[01:11:09.172 --> 01:11:09.612]  I think so.
[01:11:31.656 --> 01:11:33.778]  Very, very austere conditions.
[01:11:34.498 --> 01:11:39.302]  The prisons that were restored were done to the minimal standards.
[01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:51.291]  In one case, the contractors put the hinges on the insides of the prison doors so the prisoners took all the hinge pins out and were waiting outside in the courtyard and scared the Iraqi guards away and the MPs had to go back in and
[01:11:52.232 --> 01:11:54.253]  Regained control of the prison facility.
[01:11:54.814 --> 01:12:01.978]  But Abu Ghraib was never intended to be a permanent prison or detention operation.
[01:12:02.538 --> 01:12:18.507]  It was used as an interim facility, largely because there was real estate available inside the 20-foot-high retaining wall, which was the first line of defense, for us to establish temporary camps, prisoner of war camps.
[01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:20.568]  If there was still a war going on,
[01:12:21.109 --> 01:12:24.371]  This would have been much like a prisoner of war camp.
[01:12:25.271 --> 01:12:33.215]  It was never an ideal location of any kind for detention operations, let alone interrogation operations, as it ultimately became.
[01:12:33.675 --> 01:12:44.441]  General, we're talking to Brigadier General Janice Karpinski, now retired, and Lord Bush busted her down to Colonel when she started going public about a year ago, refusing to go along with his fraud.
[01:12:44.821 --> 01:12:47.842]  I mean, specifically, let's get into the separation of duties.
[01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:48.843]  Once you guys...
[01:12:49.683 --> 01:12:50.224]  Are in there.
[01:12:50.244 --> 01:12:51.085]  You're overloaded.
[01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:52.586]  3,400 troops.
[01:12:52.626 --> 01:12:53.547]  That's with security.
[01:12:53.867 --> 01:13:01.495]  A lot of your prisons and facilities are under daily bombardment by rockets, grenades, snipers, bombings.
[01:13:02.435 --> 01:13:16.225]  And on top of this, I didn't specifically, because obviously you were there in commanding this, how the military intelligence took over and cloistered and kind of sequestered their own little reservations within your reservations.
[01:13:16.886 --> 01:13:27.614]  The military intelligence brigade commander relocated to Abu Ghraib after two of his soldiers were killed in a RPG attack out at the prison facility.
[01:13:28.034 --> 01:13:31.797]  He was visiting one night, only intended to spend one or two nights out there
[01:13:32.552 --> 01:13:50.101]  There was an attack and two of the soldiers were killed and shortly after that he made the decision to relocate to Abu Ghraib and he had about six interrogation teams which then became about a dozen interrogation teams and these were military interrogators.
[01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:53.103]  These were soldiers who were serving as interrogators.
[01:13:53.523 --> 01:13:55.924]  They were following their regulations, their doctrine.
[01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:58.785]  We had a very low number, a very small number of
[01:14:00.464 --> 01:14:01.147]  We're good to go.
[01:14:07.934 --> 01:14:11.315]  Missing curfew, a weapon in the trunk of the car, whatever it may have been.
[01:14:11.455 --> 01:14:13.916]  Well, that's what the Army's other report said.
[01:14:13.956 --> 01:14:20.037]  It said that between 75% and 90% were totally innocent and just hadn't had their papers in order.
[01:14:20.137 --> 01:14:20.818]  That's correct.
[01:14:20.938 --> 01:14:33.361]  And it remains so, I believe it remains so today because they're still doing these raids, these roundups where they'll go out and target an individual and whoever happens to be around that individual, they bring them all in.
[01:14:33.661 --> 01:14:36.282]  And then there's no way, there's no avenue to release them
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.500]  I think so.
[01:14:59.105 --> 01:15:05.089]  Anything other than chaos as far as who's in charge, who can give me orders, who can instruct me.
[01:15:05.129 --> 01:15:07.410]  What was it like having somebody under you, though?
[01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:11.253]  I mean, I've heard the stories of Delta Force commanding generals around.
[01:15:11.513 --> 01:15:14.735]  What was it like having somebody under you basically telling you what to do?
[01:15:15.175 --> 01:15:17.216]  Well, Colonel Pappas never worked for me.
[01:15:17.757 --> 01:15:19.658]  He was never in my chain of command.
[01:15:19.678 --> 01:15:21.279]  So he just basically did whatever he wanted?
[01:15:21.399 --> 01:15:21.919]  Absolutely.
[01:15:21.939 --> 01:15:24.581]  When it came to interrogations, he answered to General Fast.
[01:15:25.106 --> 01:15:29.569]  Who was the intelligence officer at the headquarters and to General Sanchez, who was the commander.
[01:15:30.369 --> 01:15:33.291]  He didn't report any of his interrogation findings through me.
[01:15:33.391 --> 01:15:51.302]  In fact, the one time that one of his captains, when we had this first raid that was conducted and they brought in about 37 security detainees, within about 36 hours they had interviewed all of them and said that the majority of them were available for release.
[01:15:51.914 --> 01:16:00.700]  When I briefed that that evening at the nightly update, I was told by General Wojciechowski, the deputy commander, not to release anybody.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.842]  And who gave me those instructions?
[01:16:03.962 --> 01:16:06.083]  And I said they weren't instructions, it was a list.
[01:16:06.724 --> 01:16:10.246]  The interrogator said they were eligible to be released and were ready to release them.
[01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.868]  And they're of no further intel value.
[01:16:12.888 --> 01:16:14.829]  He said, you are not to release anybody.
[01:16:15.478 --> 01:16:22.482]  And then he got the captain and read him the riot act about not releasing anybody and there started the pattern of holding
[01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:25.769]  Largely innocent people.
[01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:29.730]  Well, General, we've got you for the rest of this hour, and my mind's just spinning.
[01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:31.430]  I mean, there's so much I want to talk about.
[01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:39.373]  I want to talk about what happened in there, how they kept you guys out of it, then how they tried to blame you with it when their own documents show you weren't even allowed in there.
[01:16:40.313 --> 01:16:50.036]  All of this going on, and then we've got Alberto Gonzalez writing memos that then the Pentagon uses, giving orders to their own little subgroups under black ops,
[01:16:50.776 --> 01:16:56.659]  And then they send people to prison for following orders, even in their own groups.
[01:16:56.679 --> 01:17:00.180]  I mean, it's just, there's so many facets to this.
[01:17:00.561 --> 01:17:01.781]  And they're all bad.
[01:17:02.741 --> 01:17:03.122]  Yes.
[01:17:05.062 --> 01:17:17.388]  We can trace now, we can trace back to, through documents that were released under court order, we can trace back to the original document, the one that Alberto Gonzalez reviewed and
[01:17:17.927 --> 01:17:22.391]  Discussed with the President of the United States a departure from the Geneva Conventions.
[01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:23.652]  These are not prisoners.
[01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.093]  These are terrorists.
[01:17:25.593 --> 01:17:27.475]  And these techniques will be more effective.
[01:17:28.035 --> 01:17:36.422]  And then Secretary Rumsfeld putting his signature on a document authorizing more aggressive techniques, harsher techniques during interrogation.
[01:17:36.982 --> 01:17:44.248]  That document goes down to Guantanamo Bay and over to Afghanistan and it's used perhaps first
[01:17:44.955 --> 01:17:50.336]  In small groups, and then it's used at Guantanamo Bay as a standard practice.
[01:17:51.337 --> 01:17:57.958]  Well, specifically, General, we've got a break, but what about private contractors inside Abu Ghraib and other areas?
[01:17:57.998 --> 01:18:00.819]  Because we've seen the reports that they were in there, too.
[01:18:01.019 --> 01:18:01.679]  Absolutely.
[01:18:01.759 --> 01:18:08.981]  And when you ask private contractors to do anything related to combat operations, you're already heading down a very dangerous path.
[01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:13.832]  We're talking about mercenaries, but now mercenary interrogators?
[01:18:13.852 --> 01:18:17.674]  I mean, I remember sitting in an L.A.
[01:18:17.714 --> 01:18:24.396]  hotel room watching Rumsfeld going, we've taken the gloves off, we're really pressuring them, and laughter in the military briefing.
[01:18:25.056 --> 01:18:27.937]  I mean, this was all publicly encouraged.
[01:18:28.497 --> 01:18:31.979]  And then they can send people to prison while they don't get in trouble?
[01:18:32.039 --> 01:18:33.600]  I just can't figure that out.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:35.001]  General, this is amazing.
[01:18:35.021 --> 01:18:35.541]  We've got a break.
[01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:38.943]  We'll be back in about three minutes, and then we'll continue.
[01:18:40.323 --> 01:18:47.447]  Just any areas, directions you want to go in, just tell us, because this is such a wide field.
[01:18:47.927 --> 01:18:48.788]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.848 --> 01:18:52.190]  We're talking to General Janice Karpinski.
[01:18:53.476 --> 01:18:54.257]  Attention drivers.
[01:18:54.577 --> 01:18:57.099]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:18:57.419 --> 01:19:00.721]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:05.905]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents in fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:19:06.265 --> 01:19:09.928]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.

[01:21:54.858 --> 01:21:58.323]  Government is best which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:58.764 --> 01:22:01.468]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:01.928 --> 01:22:04.572]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:05.013 --> 01:22:11.422]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:22:11.682 --> 01:22:12.423]  We're good to go.
[01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.756]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:33.936 --> 01:22:34.277]  Have you?
[01:22:34.857 --> 01:22:36.359]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:22:40.563 --> 01:22:44.588]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:46.089]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:47.831]  Osama bin forgotten.
[01:22:48.272 --> 01:22:51.896]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:22:57.087 --> 01:23:00.858]  Folks, I want you to think about the magnitude of the defections.
[01:23:00.918 --> 01:23:04.168]  Last week we had Ray McGovern, number five in the CIA.
[01:23:05.757 --> 01:23:17.961]  Who briefed Ronald Reagan, who briefed George Bush Sr., coming right out on air saying Bush may carry out terror attacks because he's in so much trouble to keep his war going, that our own government might pull something.
[01:23:18.001 --> 01:23:20.982]  I mean, that's how out in the open all this is getting.
[01:23:21.442 --> 01:23:23.023]  That's how many whistleblowers there are.
[01:23:23.283 --> 01:23:29.305]  Ron Paul, Republican congressman, saying the government may be preparing for a coup d'etat, for martial law.
[01:23:30.365 --> 01:23:35.067]  I mean, that's how Twilight Zone things have gotten, and here we are talking to...
[01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:40.060]  Brigadier General Janice Karpinski in her new book, One Woman's Army.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.080]  You talk about courage.
[01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:43.361]  At first, they were blaming her.
[01:23:43.382 --> 01:23:44.402]  People said, oh, she's the one.
[01:23:44.442 --> 01:23:45.402]  I got on air, remember?
[01:23:45.422 --> 01:23:50.565]  And I said, folks, these areas are under military intelligence control.
[01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.186]  They're CIA interrogators.
[01:23:52.206 --> 01:23:54.047]  It's the same thing at Camp X-Ray.
[01:23:54.067 --> 01:23:55.647]  They have a CIA base within a base.
[01:23:56.028 --> 01:23:57.028]  This is pure bull.
[01:23:57.468 --> 01:23:58.769]  And later, that did come out.
[01:23:58.809 --> 01:23:59.869]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:01.450]  We knew how they were doing this.
[01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:04.331]  General, let's go right down the line here.
[01:24:08.439 --> 01:24:09.399]  We have the documents.
[01:24:09.439 --> 01:24:11.800]  We know where these orders to do this torture came from.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.000]  Came right from the top.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:27.184]  Filtered all the way down through the Secretary of Defense with the endorsement of the President, the Vice President, you know, whatever advisors are surrounding him, and filtered down through the commanders in the field.
[01:24:27.984 --> 01:24:35.025]  These practices were not only endorsed, but were in use at Guantanamo Bay and in locations in Afghanistan.
[01:24:35.466 --> 01:24:36.926]  And when General Miller visited Iraq...
[01:24:37.662 --> 01:24:44.826]  He carried those techniques with him and taught the interrogators on site how to be more effective in their interrogations.
[01:24:44.966 --> 01:24:55.091]  And then he sent contract interrogators and people he knew, military people he knew, who had performed well down at Guantanamo Bay, he sent them to Iraq as well.
[01:24:56.212 --> 01:24:59.413]  So really we had kind of torture seminars going on.
[01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:02.875]  Yes, everywhere except in Abu Ghraib.
[01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:16.340]  Because General Miller must have thought that his discussions with the Military Intelligence Brigade commander were effective enough for him to understand that he could do anything he needed to do to get actionable intelligence from the prisoners.
[01:25:18.101 --> 01:25:31.245]  Now, you know, they talk about how they went after Grainer and England and others because they had photos, but you point out in your book, why then, you know, who took the pictures and why did that happen?
[01:25:32.025 --> 01:25:43.789]  And then on top of it, if Congress has seen over 2,000 photos and over 100 videos of raping women, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about savage Joseph Mingala type stuff, even underage people.
[01:25:44.249 --> 01:25:47.570]  I mean, if this is going on, then why haven't all those people been indicted?
[01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:51.354]  Because they needed a group of people to call the scapegoat.
[01:25:51.474 --> 01:25:52.795]  Excuse me.
[01:25:52.815 --> 01:26:08.592]  They needed to scapegoat people, and they must have believed naively that they were going to take the punishment, go to jail, and be quiet, that they would never go out and hire their own attorneys or representatives for themselves in their own cases.
[01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:18.473]  They certainly believed that I was going to be quiet, that I was just going to take what they were accusing me of and go back home to the United States after my deployment.
[01:26:18.713 --> 01:26:19.714]  Now this was in the press.
[01:26:19.734 --> 01:26:25.256]  The first you heard of it was when the investigation was already going and you'd never even been in that area of the prison.
[01:26:25.456 --> 01:26:26.096]  That's correct.
[01:26:26.296 --> 01:26:33.739]  I didn't hear about this from the people that you would think I should hear it from, General Sanchez or his intelligence officer, General Fast.
[01:26:34.219 --> 01:26:36.660]  I heard about this in an email late at night
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:37.521]  I think so.
[01:26:56.468 --> 01:26:57.990]  That was on the 12th of January of 2004.
[01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:02.016]  That was the first I heard of any investigation.
[01:27:02.056 --> 01:27:06.603]  You're the commanding officer of all the prisons and you don't even know about it.
[01:27:06.823 --> 01:27:07.444]  That's correct.
[01:27:07.464 --> 01:27:09.928]  They kept me out of the loop on purpose.
[01:27:11.488 --> 01:27:13.689]  How is the military supposed to operate?
[01:27:13.849 --> 01:27:15.549]  I mean, no military has ever done this.
[01:27:15.829 --> 01:27:21.950]  Hitler was really the first to have the SS separate from the mainline army, and it was disastrous.
[01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:24.251]  And this was disastrous as well.
[01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:32.193]  You take a prison location that was never a good location for any kind of detention operations.
[01:27:32.273 --> 01:27:33.733]  It was being mortared every night.
[01:27:34.258 --> 01:27:34.538]  Thank you.
[01:27:57.853 --> 01:28:10.038]  Well, I read about where they would go get prison guards, federal prison guards with bad records, and actually hire them.
[01:28:10.058 --> 01:28:12.178]  They were actually scouting for sickos.
[01:28:12.678 --> 01:28:19.621]  Well, there is a... You know, and not only... The prison experts that were hired...
[01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:25.071]  We were supposed to have about 80 of them down at the Coalition Provisional Authority.
[01:28:25.151 --> 01:28:25.871]  There was three.
[01:28:26.292 --> 01:28:27.672]  And then one of them got fired.
[01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:28.613]  And these are U.S.
[01:28:28.693 --> 01:28:29.513]  contractors.
[01:28:30.373 --> 01:28:36.716]  Of course, they didn't share the information about their previous positions with us.
[01:28:36.856 --> 01:28:39.837]  But after we returned, we found out that... General, we've got a break.
[01:28:39.877 --> 01:28:40.657]  Tell us after the break.
[01:28:43.599 --> 01:28:44.539]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.979 --> 01:28:46.500]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.512 --> 01:28:50.194]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:12.193 --> 01:29:12.693]  We're good to go.
[01:29:34.693 --> 01:29:37.654]  Order the book and DVD now for one low price.
[01:29:37.734 --> 01:29:39.815]  Get Bulletproof Asset Protection now.
[01:29:40.115 --> 01:29:40.555]  Call them 888-240-3337.

[01:29:42.996 --> 01:29:44.356]  Tell them you heard it on GCN.
[01:29:53.695 --> 01:30:01.959]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.199 --> 01:30:06.561]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:15.765]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.965 --> 01:30:19.607]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.887 --> 01:30:24.912]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.212 --> 01:30:31.899]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.409 --> 01:30:33.070]  What about you?
[01:30:33.710 --> 01:30:39.076]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:54.073 --> 01:31:00.436]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:05.659]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.979 --> 01:31:13.903]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.043 --> 01:31:21.086]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:21.306 --> 01:31:21.987]  We're good to go.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.501]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:41.561]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.581 --> 01:31:42.601]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.661 --> 01:31:46.021]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:46.061 --> 01:31:48.062]  We've got the General for about 30 more minutes.
[01:31:48.082 --> 01:31:48.962]  Really honored to have her.
[01:32:07.597 --> 01:32:11.759]  She's the Brigadier General who ran the prisons and camps in Iraq.
[01:32:12.259 --> 01:32:14.280]  General Janice Karpinski.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.101]  Her new book, One Woman's Army.
[01:32:16.821 --> 01:32:18.261]  And it's in bookstores everywhere.
[01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:18.922]  You need to get it.
[01:32:19.802 --> 01:32:22.463]  And look, I just got my copy a few days ago that the publisher mailed me.
[01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:23.043]  It's excellent.
[01:32:23.063 --> 01:32:25.124]  I haven't read the whole thing and I've read about three chapters.
[01:32:26.605 --> 01:32:29.186]  But we need to support people that are bold and tell the truth.
[01:32:29.975 --> 01:32:31.576]  And they didn't expect her to go public.
[01:32:31.596 --> 01:32:34.718]  That's where we had left off when we went to break.
[01:32:35.479 --> 01:32:38.501]  I guess they expected you to be spineless like all the others.
[01:32:39.141 --> 01:32:54.992]  You know, there's an increasing number, and it's a great concern to me personally and professionally because I saw senior officers in Iraq who were more concerned about the political ramifications of their decisions than they were about the leadership or moral decisions, ramifications.
[01:32:55.472 --> 01:32:58.074]  They were hesitant to...
[01:32:59.781 --> 01:33:00.502]  We're good to go.
[01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:25.478]  They're afraid to voice their opinions, they're afraid to state their opinions, and they're afraid to say, no, you're wrong.
[01:33:25.658 --> 01:33:42.087]  Well, even their, General, even their Enron crony, their darling, Army Secretary White, who was an insider with these guys, he said, look, the generals say 400,000 troops, we're going to fail, it's what all the Rand Corporation says, and they said, you're out of there, buddy.
[01:33:42.267 --> 01:33:44.488]  And that's what they did to General Shinseki as well.
[01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:47.350]  He went back to Secretary Rumsfeld twice.
[01:33:48.047 --> 01:33:51.891]  And he said, we need more than 300,000 soldiers if we're going to do this right.
[01:33:52.251 --> 01:33:57.477]  And the second time he went back to him, he said, well, then I guess you don't understand me and I don't need you.
[01:33:57.577 --> 01:33:58.778]  And he brought in his own team.
[01:33:59.619 --> 01:34:05.605]  And General Shinseki was, for all practical purposes, a lame duck for months until he retired.
[01:34:07.282 --> 01:34:23.675]  It's amazing, though, that, I mean, when they get unanimous data from the people that know how to fight wars and know how to get the power back on and help the civilian population, they just, you know, I'm sure you've seen the Karl Rove quote where he says, we control reality, we make reality.
[01:34:23.715 --> 01:34:24.956]  I mean, they really are delusional.
[01:34:25.036 --> 01:34:26.257]  You want to see reality?
[01:34:26.297 --> 01:34:27.278]  Go to Baghdad.
[01:34:27.318 --> 01:34:28.278]  That's reality.
[01:34:28.639 --> 01:34:30.460]  Walk the ground where the soldiers are walking.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.461]  That's reality.
[01:34:32.048 --> 01:34:36.870]  This nonsense about running, and this is what happened with the CJTF 7 headquarters.
[01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:41.851]  The officers on General Sanchez's staff were trying to run the war from their laptop computers.
[01:34:42.351 --> 01:34:45.552]  They didn't go out and walk the ground that the soldiers were walking.
[01:34:45.612 --> 01:34:48.553]  They didn't see what the soldiers were facing every day.
[01:34:48.953 --> 01:34:52.174]  They were trying to run the war from their laptop computers.
[01:34:52.594 --> 01:34:57.576]  They were afraid to go out in the middle of the hostilities, but they had no problem sending any of us out
[01:34:58.036 --> 01:34:58.837]  To do that work.
[01:34:59.197 --> 01:35:10.102]  So we've gone from George Washington at Trenton charging into the German soldiers himself with bullets flicking through his hat to generals cowering in armored compounds.
[01:35:10.642 --> 01:35:11.183]  Exactly.
[01:35:11.643 --> 01:35:12.063]  Exactly.
[01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:15.405]  You want to know where the armored vehicles were and they weren't out on the road with the soldiers?
[01:35:15.825 --> 01:35:19.827]  They were protecting the spokesperson for General Sanchez.
[01:35:20.167 --> 01:35:27.411]  They were parked on the confines of Camp Victory so in case any of those officers had to take a 20-minute journey somewhere across the road to the airport...
[01:35:27.772 --> 01:35:32.254]  They'd be in an up-armored vehicle and soldiers were paying the price for that.
[01:35:34.614 --> 01:35:35.434]  But they don't care.
[01:35:35.475 --> 01:35:41.298]  They'll just have a neocon get on the radio and say they've got plenty of armored vehicles when I've got family over there and they still don't.
[01:35:41.798 --> 01:35:43.699]  What are these letters we're getting back home?
[01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:44.980]  What are these soldiers saying?
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.260]  Are they all wrong?
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:47.941]  Are they all making this up?
[01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:55.645]  When a soldier stands up and says to the Secretary of Defense, why don't we have the right equipment if you want us to do this the right way and survive?
[01:35:56.026 --> 01:35:57.907]  And he says, well, we go to war with the Army.
[01:35:57.967 --> 01:36:00.228]  We have not necessarily the one that we want.
[01:36:00.608 --> 01:36:02.209]  And it's never addressed again.
[01:36:03.126 --> 01:36:18.332]  The person who stopped the orders for additional armored equipment and armored vehicles is today a four-star general and is in the Pentagon and is serving as the acting chief of staff of the Army.
[01:36:18.712 --> 01:36:34.264]  Well, the FBI agents that blocked Robert Wright and Kathleen Rowley and others, who specifically had the documents and knew who the hijackers were, according to the official story, they all got demoted or removed or fired, but the people that blocked them have all been promoted.
[01:36:34.284 --> 01:36:35.545]  See how it works?
[01:36:36.172 --> 01:36:36.713]  We're good to go.
[01:36:55.926 --> 01:36:59.428]  And that's a big message to be sending throughout the force.
[01:36:59.748 --> 01:37:03.650]  You cross the Secretary of Defense and you're out on the street.
[01:37:03.670 --> 01:37:06.771]  But if I was the Secretary of Defense, I would want the real intel.
[01:37:07.111 --> 01:37:09.172]  I would want to know what was really going on.
[01:37:09.492 --> 01:37:15.255]  I would want to know what the trained warfighters were saying instead of this delusional la-la.
[01:37:15.435 --> 01:37:17.756]  I mean, just because I think something doesn't make it so.
[01:37:18.196 --> 01:37:21.458]  Or just because you repeat a lie often enough doesn't make it the truth.
[01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:24.492]  But you've already started down that road.
[01:37:24.612 --> 01:37:34.200]  If you stop this train, which is what they need to do realistically, they need to stop this train and say, wait, clean the slate.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.783]  We need to get to the truth and we need to get there now.
[01:37:38.263 --> 01:37:40.465]  But, I mean, General, how obvious is it?
[01:37:41.005 --> 01:37:41.786]  We're good to go.
[01:37:57.741 --> 01:38:01.945]  You know, 90 to 9, the Senate says no more torture.
[01:38:01.965 --> 01:38:03.586]  You've got to follow the manual.
[01:38:03.786 --> 01:38:06.388]  You've got to follow the law, the regulations.
[01:38:06.689 --> 01:38:08.910]  And then Bush says, no, I'm going to veto that.
[01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:18.558]  I mean, look, he's sending people to prison, little nothings like England and Grainer, who are obviously psychopaths at the point.
[01:38:19.058 --> 01:38:26.483]  They're sending them to prison for following their degenerate orders of the handlers that were in there controlling them, that took the photos, that thought it was cute.
[01:38:26.743 --> 01:38:31.306]  Meanwhile, Bush is on TV saying, I'm going to veto, we're going to torture.
[01:38:31.806 --> 01:38:32.847]  Right, what are they afraid of?
[01:38:32.947 --> 01:38:39.491]  Why do we have to have a new law that says we're not going to torture or abuse?
[01:38:39.931 --> 01:38:42.453]  That's what the Geneva Conventions are supposed to be about.
[01:38:43.073 --> 01:38:44.295]  Why do we have to have a law?
[01:38:44.315 --> 01:38:46.077]  I think it's a step in the right direction.
[01:38:46.257 --> 01:38:50.822]  But General, even the Soviets didn't admit they tortured.
[01:38:51.082 --> 01:38:52.424]  Hitler didn't admit they tortured.
[01:38:52.444 --> 01:38:57.269]  I'm sorry for interrupting, but it seems we've reached a new level here where they even admit it now.
[01:38:57.850 --> 01:38:58.651]  Well, exactly.
[01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:00.332]  General, why is the torture so perverted?
[01:39:23.482 --> 01:39:38.952]  Well, I think, you know, to me, when they use, particularly women, this sexual overtones, using a woman to try to get an Iraqi man or a Muslim man to break and to give them information.
[01:39:39.372 --> 01:39:51.755]  This is insulting and humiliating, not only to the female that they're using to do the interrogation, but they're getting some kind of bizarre sense of pleasure, the interrogators are, watching this whole thing take place.
[01:39:51.875 --> 01:39:53.715]  I know, this is something out of a horror movie.
[01:39:53.795 --> 01:40:00.077]  Naked women putting, I hate to use this, menstrual fluids on men?
[01:40:00.737 --> 01:40:01.237]  Exactly.
[01:40:01.937 --> 01:40:05.858]  And who studied the Arab culture to come up with such an idea?
[01:40:06.641 --> 01:40:09.242]  I mean, this is insulting to anybody.
[01:40:09.382 --> 01:40:13.283]  But, I mean, if I made a horror movie where the military was doing this, people wouldn't believe it.
[01:40:13.323 --> 01:40:14.243]  It's so bizarre.
[01:40:14.623 --> 01:40:15.363]  It is bizarre.
[01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:27.166]  And the fact that they're using female soldiers to conduct this demonstrates what they're thinking about the likelihood for women in the military.
[01:40:27.226 --> 01:40:32.088]  Well, listen, if they told me in the military, go in there and do something to a woman, you can go to hell.
[01:40:32.408 --> 01:40:32.928]  Exactly.
[01:40:33.568 --> 01:40:37.790]  And I think the majority of soldiers that are serving today would do exactly that.
[01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:39.211]  They'd say, hold on a second.
[01:40:39.731 --> 01:40:41.252]  I am not going to do that.
[01:40:41.892 --> 01:40:43.193]  And they could threaten your career.
[01:40:43.233 --> 01:40:44.614]  They could do anything they needed to.
[01:40:44.674 --> 01:40:46.455]  But I would take the same position.
[01:40:46.635 --> 01:40:47.555]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[01:40:48.016 --> 01:40:54.219]  And that's why they took every effort to keep me away from getting any information about what was going on.
[01:40:54.259 --> 01:40:57.060]  And then they tried to burn you because you had been investigating it.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:57.841]  That's right.
[01:40:58.181 --> 01:41:00.062]  And because I would have objected.
[01:41:00.642 --> 01:41:03.184]  I would have complained to the top level.
[01:41:03.364 --> 01:41:05.366]  I never would have allowed this to take place.
[01:41:05.486 --> 01:41:06.547]  What was the breaking point?
[01:41:06.587 --> 01:41:09.509]  I mean, when did you decide to not roll over and fight him?
[01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:20.217]  When I was down in Kuwait and I was waiting for... I spoke to General Taguba in the conference room down in Kuwait and he had six other men in the room with him.
[01:41:21.858 --> 01:41:22.298]  Excuse me.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.962]  And when he was asking me questions and he was insisting
[01:41:28.012 --> 01:41:29.133]  And I was holding my ground.
[01:41:29.213 --> 01:41:30.755]  I said, no, I was not in charge.
[01:41:31.195 --> 01:41:32.897]  No, I did not know this was going on.
[01:41:33.017 --> 01:41:36.341]  No, these soldiers are not derelict in the performance of their duties.
[01:41:36.901 --> 01:41:39.884]  I explained every single question that he presented to me.
[01:41:39.904 --> 01:41:48.133]  And when I saw the results of his investigation or from that interview, and he had the nerve to say that I was emotional
[01:41:49.807 --> 01:41:53.849]  Well, I wasn't the one with tears coming out of my eyes at the end of the interview.
[01:41:54.150 --> 01:42:06.238]  It was him and his six comrades because they knew what they were doing was wrong and they knew that they were going to be called to accuse me for things that clearly I was not responsible for.
[01:42:06.278 --> 01:42:11.802]  Well, that's encouraging, though, that they were crying because that means they've still got souls, at least.
[01:42:12.442 --> 01:42:13.463]  Well, one would hope.
[01:42:14.666 --> 01:42:16.088]  But I didn't see any evidence.
[01:42:16.188 --> 01:42:18.690]  They were feeling pretty guilty trying to railroad you.
[01:42:18.710 --> 01:42:23.814]  They knew that this was a compartmentalized operation, and that's now public, folks.
[01:42:24.775 --> 01:42:31.500]  Absolutely, and not only that, but General Taguba was not instructed to investigate the photographs from Cell Block 180.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:35.804]  But even his report admits raping, acid, all of this.
[01:42:35.944 --> 01:42:41.649]  Yes, but he still held the MPs from the 800th MP Brigade responsible.
[01:42:42.327 --> 01:42:47.511]  Because he said his instructions were limited to the 800th MP Brigade.
[01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:57.258]  So he had to turn over the investigation for a subsequent investigation by General Fay, who looked into the military intelligence.
[01:42:57.298 --> 01:42:59.680]  Did you tell him, I'm going to fight this propaganda?
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:00.760]  I did.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:07.005]  I told General McKiernan when he made the decision that I should not be reprimanded, that I should not be relieved.
[01:43:07.626 --> 01:43:11.207]  And he allowed me to go back to the United States, and that was in April of 2004.
[01:43:12.908 --> 01:43:22.592]  I told him that when I got back to the States, it was my intent to at least have an after-action review and make sure none of this ever happened again.
[01:43:23.212 --> 01:43:29.034]  And he said to me as I was leaving his office, there's a great future for Janusz Karpinski in the Army Reserves.
[01:43:29.875 --> 01:43:31.976]  He was the commander in the theater.
[01:43:32.356 --> 01:43:35.517]  By the time I got back to the United States and the pictures were released...
[01:43:36.215 --> 01:43:44.920]  The Chief of the Army Reserves is now using the Taguba Report as the sacred document and is suspending me and ultimately relieving me from command.
[01:43:45.121 --> 01:43:49.984]  And he has never spoken a word to me since I've been back in the United States.
[01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:52.665]  Now let's talk about war gaming.
[01:43:52.685 --> 01:43:55.387]  Folks, we're talking to a lady of such incredible courage.
[01:43:55.407 --> 01:43:57.748]  You can hear the genuineness, but I don't go off of that.
[01:43:58.409 --> 01:44:00.530]  I don't just go off of my discernment.
[01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:01.611]  I have researched this.
[01:44:01.651 --> 01:44:03.392]  We've done 50 shows on this.
[01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:06.373]  It's the same thing at Camp X-Ray.
[01:44:07.694 --> 01:44:09.696]  They sequester, they cloister.
[01:44:10.476 --> 01:44:13.960]  The regular Army, the regular Marines are not even allowed into these areas.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:20.545]  Then they've got the nerve to try to blame people that had no connection to it and that didn't go along with it.
[01:44:20.585 --> 01:44:22.147]  So that really makes me mad.
[01:44:22.167 --> 01:44:23.228]  But let's talk about war games.
[01:44:23.288 --> 01:44:25.170]  We know they say Iraq is a laboratory.
[01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:28.693]  We know they say that these prisons are laboratories, that Afghanistan is.
[01:44:29.473 --> 01:44:32.256]  And they send these cadres around making larger cadres.
[01:44:32.556 --> 01:44:42.684]  I think it's pretty clear that we are seeing the cold-blooded formation of a torture corps, and that these cadres are being expanded.
[01:44:43.605 --> 01:44:44.786]  Is that frightening to you?
[01:44:44.826 --> 01:44:45.686]  Does that concern you?
[01:44:45.726 --> 01:44:50.130]  Or do you agree with my statement that they're forming a large torture corps?
[01:44:51.435 --> 01:45:02.377]  I don't know if they'll be so bold as to call it that, but yes, I agree with you, and it makes me shudder when I think about it, because they took some contract interrogators to Iraq.
[01:45:02.757 --> 01:45:14.800]  They took some contract interrogators and put them at Abu Ghraib, testing to see what the response of the prisoners would be, testing, more importantly, to see what the response of soldiers would be to those interrogators taking over Iraq.
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:15.140]  Yes.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:15.380]  Thank you.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.761]  They're actually scouring the planet for scum.
[01:45:42.981 --> 01:45:52.025]  Yes, for people who have this kind of mindset, who can live with themselves while they're going forth in this global war on terrorism and trying to make a difference.
[01:45:52.665 --> 01:46:03.369]  But, you know, it's important to understand that even the McCain bill that was passed by overwhelming victory, 90 to 9, it's limited to the military.
[01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:11.574]  We need a law on contractors on everybody!
[01:46:11.675 --> 01:46:12.215]  Absolutely!
[01:46:12.235 --> 01:46:12.456]  Absolutely!
[01:46:12.476 --> 01:46:13.557]  I thought she was a terrorist.
[01:46:24.632 --> 01:46:24.992]  Yeah.
[01:46:25.553 --> 01:46:27.313]  I was trying to get information from her.
[01:46:27.353 --> 01:46:28.434]  I mean, let's think about this, folks.
[01:46:28.454 --> 01:46:38.998]  Since when is beating people to death and raping someone's wife in front of them because their papers weren't in order at a checkpoint, because the fat slob just wants to rape somebody, since when is that what Americans do?
[01:46:39.018 --> 01:46:41.099]  Since never.
[01:46:41.299 --> 01:46:42.499]  We don't do those kind of things.
[01:46:42.539 --> 01:46:43.360]  We're better than this.
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:46.741]  General, what would you like to see happen?
[01:46:46.781 --> 01:46:48.802]  I mean, obviously, I think Gonzalez...
[01:46:49.756 --> 01:46:55.138]  And any general who we have paper trails on, knowingly part of this, I think they all need to go to prison.
[01:46:55.418 --> 01:46:56.839]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[01:46:57.879 --> 01:47:11.125]  The Inspector General, who was not the Inspector General for most of the investigation, the one who made the decision to clear, General Sanchez, General Wojciechowski, General Fast, Colonel Warren, Colonel Pappas, and General Miller.
[01:47:12.379 --> 01:47:19.726]  You know, it was only there at the direction of Secretary Rumsfeld, and that was the first action he took was to release those findings.
[01:47:20.887 --> 01:47:27.354]  It says specifically in the IG report that actions I took or failed to take in no way contributed to the abuses at Abu Ghraib.
[01:47:27.914 --> 01:47:32.699]  But most people don't have access to the Inspector General's report or don't take the time to go look for it.
[01:47:32.719 --> 01:47:34.521]  No, they really have besmirched your name.
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:35.900]  Yes, they have.
[01:47:36.581 --> 01:47:48.787]  And then, when they do a separate investigation on Guantanamo Bay, the recommendation is that they reprimand General Miller for letting interrogations get out of control, even though he was directed to do those things.
[01:47:49.287 --> 01:47:52.609]  And his boss said, no, I'm not going to reprimand him.
[01:47:52.969 --> 01:47:57.431]  And his boss just happened to be the former military aide to Secretary Rumsfeld.
[01:47:58.621 --> 01:48:01.603]  So they're all proving that their hands are dirty.
[01:48:01.623 --> 01:48:02.965]  I want people to think about this.
[01:48:03.025 --> 01:48:05.567]  One is covering up the other for the other for the other.
[01:48:06.848 --> 01:48:12.112]  I want people to think about the fact that our current Attorney General, the supposed guy enforcing all these laws...
[01:48:12.774 --> 01:48:18.196]  He's writing memos saying Bush is above the law and the law flows from him, saying he's an emperor.
[01:48:18.276 --> 01:48:19.657]  I mean, that's the actual memo.
[01:48:20.037 --> 01:48:21.238]  Saying torture's good.
[01:48:21.258 --> 01:48:28.020]  I want people to realize that General Shoemaker is the guy who sent Delta Force in at Waco.
[01:48:28.661 --> 01:48:36.384]  I want people to know that they are now putting in a constellation, a gaggle, of people that are willing to do this.
[01:48:36.484 --> 01:48:38.845]  I tell you, General, this is really scary.
[01:48:39.085 --> 01:48:41.566]  Well, this scares me, too, and I agree with you because...
[01:48:43.067 --> 01:48:44.947]  They have rewritten the dictionary.
[01:48:45.768 --> 01:48:50.450]  There's a prisoner of war and then there's an Iraqi detainee or a prisoner, an Iraqi criminal.
[01:48:50.870 --> 01:49:02.276]  And then there's this category of security detainees that seem to be apart from any of the Geneva Conventions and not subject to the rules that military personnel have followed for years.
[01:49:02.716 --> 01:49:10.619]  Now you bring into that equation contractors who are not subject to the UCMJ or appear to be above the rules.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:11.520]  So
[01:49:12.377 --> 01:49:16.798]  We haven't gotten it right yet, although the bill, unfortunately, moves in the right direction.
[01:49:17.259 --> 01:49:20.420]  And now, well, at least it forced Bush to go public and say he's for torture.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.760]  I mean, it really put the spotlight on these guys.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:30.083]  But I just can't believe we're even having to sit here and debate this and talk about this, but they are being exposed.
[01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:33.183]  Our final segment with the general.
[01:49:34.144 --> 01:49:38.065]  I might take a call or two, but we're also going to plug her book, so get your pens and paper ready for that.
[01:49:38.917 --> 01:49:40.561]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:49:41.082 --> 01:49:49.339]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv as we fight this tyranny.
[01:49:49.359 --> 01:49:49.940]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.679 --> 01:49:57.541]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.801 --> 01:49:59.382]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.723 --> 01:50:04.386]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.746 --> 01:50:09.170]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:13.793]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.993 --> 01:50:16.835]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.935 --> 01:50:18.977]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks...
[01:50:19.617 --> 01:50:20.178]  We're good to go.
[01:50:44.579 --> 01:50:57.471]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.811 --> 01:51:06.639]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.959 --> 01:51:11.643]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.083 --> 01:51:18.807]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.208 --> 01:51:30.995]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.475 --> 01:51:35.918]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:36.099 --> 01:51:38.540]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:40.402]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:40.422 --> 01:51:41.623]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.703 --> 01:51:43.164]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:43.184 --> 01:51:44.224]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:55.137 --> 01:52:01.079]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.319 --> 01:52:03.560]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:10.102]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.442 --> 01:52:11.103]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.657 --> 01:52:30.937]  The third hour.
[01:52:59.818 --> 01:53:01.059]  Here in about five minutes.
[01:53:01.079 --> 01:53:11.571]  And about eight after, we're going to have Scott Ritter, the UN weapons inspector, the brave Marine that blew the whistle on the lies day one before this whole nightmare started.
[01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:14.254]  And boy, has he been proven to be correct.
[01:53:14.989 --> 01:53:20.111]  I don't want to hear from people that, well, you know, something this big, it would come out, we would know.
[01:53:20.831 --> 01:53:36.937]  On every front, from the financial war profiteering, to the attack on the Bill of Rights, to protecting terrorist groups, to, you know, all of this, that this current cabal is engaged in, it all has come out.
[01:53:37.397 --> 01:53:38.578]  People do blow the whistle.
[01:53:38.618 --> 01:53:39.718]  People do tell the truth.
[01:53:40.402 --> 01:53:45.807]  But a lot of the news media, owned by the very financial interests that stand to gain from this, try to spin it.
[01:53:46.067 --> 01:53:49.790]  That's why the alternative media is exploding in size, because people aren't buying it anymore.
[01:53:50.671 --> 01:53:59.038]  The General has graciously decided to stay with us another five minutes in the next hour, so we can get to Tony and Larry and a few others, and we're about to go to your calls.
[01:53:59.639 --> 01:54:06.825]  But the new book by General Janice Karpinski is One Woman's Army.
[01:54:07.999 --> 01:54:09.619]  One Woman's Army.
[01:54:10.179 --> 01:54:16.781]  And General, tell us a little bit about the book and tell us about the publisher and some of the websites.
[01:54:16.861 --> 01:54:29.923]  The book is really about my, from when I grew up wanting to be in the military and then my military career and what led me to promotion to Brigadier General and then my assignment as the commander of the 800th MP Brigade.
[01:54:30.703 --> 01:54:33.944]  I felt like I really needed to reestablish my credibility
[01:54:34.505 --> 01:54:46.152]  Because it was widely destroyed by the spin from linking my name to those, exclusively my name, to those photographs and my leadership failures.
[01:54:47.392 --> 01:54:48.953]  It was important.
[01:54:49.113 --> 01:54:50.574]  It was an important story to tell.
[01:54:50.594 --> 01:55:01.080]  I wanted women especially, but people around the world to understand that there are conscientious people in the military and we serve for a variety of reasons, but
[01:55:01.633 --> 01:55:11.436]  Abu Ghraib and Iraq was a situation that was clearly out of control, and certainly not, we weren't able to rein it in on my watch.
[01:55:11.996 --> 01:55:14.957]  And this is, of course, published by Miramax Books.
[01:55:15.958 --> 01:55:21.379]  And for those that, also, General, kind of out of left field here, have you ever heard of P2OG?
[01:55:21.419 --> 01:55:21.639]  No.
[01:55:21.679 --> 01:55:21.759]  No.
[01:55:24.461 --> 01:55:32.028]  Well, that's a secret Pentagon paper and Pentagon operation group with funding of upwards of $6 billion per year.
[01:55:32.749 --> 01:55:36.112]  And it was formed on the eve of the Gulf War by Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:55:36.132 --> 01:55:37.913]  Just type P2OG into Google.
[01:55:38.294 --> 01:55:39.835]  Most people in the military don't feel bad.
[01:55:39.875 --> 01:55:42.577]  I've never even heard of it because it's another compartmentalized group.
[01:55:42.958 --> 01:55:45.400]  Where Rumsfeld said, stimulate terrorist attacks.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:47.982]  I would because from July of 2003 when we arrived in Iraq...
[01:56:13.019 --> 01:56:16.461]  It really did seem like we would only be there for a couple more months.
[01:56:17.341 --> 01:56:26.865]  Things to the north and the south of Baghdad seemed to be generally peaceful and returning to life as they do it and certainly back under Iraqi control.
[01:56:27.366 --> 01:56:34.749]  But Baghdad and the surrounding vicinity including the Sunni triangle was very resistant and somehow they capitalized on that
[01:56:35.256 --> 01:56:35.736]  We're good to go.
[01:56:57.151 --> 01:56:58.972]  More accurate than ever before.
[01:56:58.992 --> 01:57:00.934]  Well, also, I mean, the military's not stupid.
[01:57:00.954 --> 01:57:04.197]  I've talked to so many experts who were in Vietnam fighting insurgencies.
[01:57:04.797 --> 01:57:09.421]  If one person shoots at you from a little village, you don't arrest every man down to the age of 11.
[01:57:10.102 --> 01:57:12.464]  You don't bulldoze all their date palms.
[01:57:13.144 --> 01:57:14.426]  I mean, you just made enemies.
[01:57:14.526 --> 01:57:15.907]  But they did this over and over again.
[01:57:16.894 --> 01:57:24.000]  They ran over again and they took the women as hostages so they could get the men to come in, to turn themselves in.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:30.365]  I mean, everything you could think of that would insult an Arab mindset and an Arab family.
[01:57:30.385 --> 01:57:31.166]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:31.186 --> 01:57:31.846]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.387 --> 01:57:38.051]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.091 --> 01:57:38.471]  Introduction.
[01:57:50.042 --> 01:57:50.703]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.363 --> 01:57:52.403]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.124 --> 01:57:54.244]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.884 --> 01:57:55.705]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.465 --> 01:57:57.325]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.025 --> 01:58:01.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.207 --> 01:58:06.348]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.249 --> 01:58:12.951]  Well, an amazing lady, and I've researched the facts, nothing to do with...
[01:58:14.221 --> 01:58:24.372]  The torture, criticized having areas of her command basically taken away and given to internal minions of military intelligence and private torture contractors.
[01:58:26.033 --> 01:58:27.995]  And she's got her new book out.
[01:58:28.035 --> 01:58:29.077]  I hope that she'll get it.
[01:58:30.598 --> 01:58:31.899]  And this is our final segment with her.
[01:58:31.919 --> 01:58:33.600]  We're going to take a few final calls.
[01:58:34.861 --> 01:58:36.922]  Raider General Janice Arpinski.
[01:58:37.522 --> 01:58:40.304]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Arkansas and Larry in Louisiana.
[01:58:40.324 --> 01:58:41.284]  That's all we have time for.
[01:58:41.304 --> 01:58:42.345]  Then Scott Ritter is coming on.
[01:58:42.645 --> 01:58:43.406]  Tony, go ahead.
[01:58:43.606 --> 01:58:44.126]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:44.726 --> 01:58:46.387]  God bless you, General, for your courage.
[01:58:46.407 --> 01:58:50.610]  There's a lot of us out here who support you and thank you for your courage as an American to come forward with this.
[01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:51.831]  And I appreciate that.
[01:58:52.051 --> 01:58:52.471]  Thank you.
[01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:58.435]  I just wanted to ask you a couple of comments, if you could, real quickly, on Kevin P. Burns, the Fire Enforcer General.
[01:58:58.475 --> 01:58:59.255]  Kevin P. Burns said,
[01:58:59.676 --> 01:59:00.876]  What was the information on that?
[01:59:00.896 --> 01:59:06.798]  From my understanding, you cannot fire someone like that without a court-martial or an act of Congress.
[01:59:07.418 --> 01:59:10.458]  And secondly, have you heard anything about his whereabouts?
[01:59:10.558 --> 01:59:12.999]  If you had any knowledge at all, and I'll listen off the air.
[01:59:13.059 --> 01:59:13.419]  Thank you.
[01:59:13.659 --> 01:59:27.602]  Yeah, the suspicious firing of Burns just a few months before he was going to retire anyways, and then it turned out he was already getting a divorce, and they said, oh, well, he had a girlfriend but was off base who wasn't military, and that's not normal.
[01:59:28.467 --> 01:59:30.408]  Well, it's his personal life.
[01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:37.694]  I mean, if the man is separated from his spouse, it's up to him what he thinks is correct or what isn't correct to do.
[01:59:37.974 --> 01:59:39.035]  Very suspicious.
[01:59:40.395 --> 01:59:48.181]  Yeah, he probably was critical of Rumsfeld or the direction the war was taking, and they found a way to finish him off.
[01:59:49.362 --> 01:59:55.746]  I don't know where he's gone from now, or actually what he's doing.
[01:59:56.667 --> 01:59:57.988]  In fact, the caller was correct.
[01:59:59.631 --> 02:00:05.615]  It does take the Senate Armed Services Committee or an act of Congress to demote a general officer.
[02:00:05.675 --> 02:00:07.817]  But the Washington Post just said, I'm sold firing.
[02:00:08.357 --> 02:00:12.360]  Well, that's correct, because under this administration, you know, the gloves are off.
[02:00:12.441 --> 02:00:14.882]  They can do whatever they want, and nobody challenges them.
[02:00:14.902 --> 02:00:19.426]  It doesn't matter what federal law is in 230 years of the way we run the military.
[02:00:19.566 --> 02:00:23.049]  Or what we voted on, or what our leaders have passed and passed.
[02:00:23.789 --> 02:00:25.712]  None of that makes a difference.
[02:00:25.732 --> 02:00:28.296]  George Washington was, again, commissioned by Congress.
[02:00:28.616 --> 02:00:31.160]  Congress does this, not the President.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.063]  It's called separation of powers.
[02:00:33.383 --> 02:00:34.465]  Larry in Louisiana.
[02:00:34.505 --> 02:00:35.266]  Larry, make it quick.
[02:00:35.306 --> 02:00:35.767]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.610]  Thank you.
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:41.502]  What is your view on the use of depleted uranium munitions?
[02:00:41.762 --> 02:00:43.123]  Are they omni-kill weapons?
[02:00:43.243 --> 02:00:45.185]  Are they multi-generational kill weapons?
[02:00:45.265 --> 02:00:47.186]  And should they be used and are they necessary?
[02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:47.906]  Yeah, let's bring that up.
[02:00:47.966 --> 02:00:53.130]  I mean, the Army's own manuals say it's very dangerous to breathe, but now the neocons say it's nutritious.
[02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:53.510]  General?
[02:00:54.131 --> 02:00:58.073]  I don't have a comment on it because I don't have enough information to make a comment.
[02:00:59.514 --> 02:01:05.038]  But I do know that there were an awful lot of decisions that were made that were governed by the neocons from Washington, D.C.,
[02:01:09.164 --> 02:01:11.886]  General, we've got to have you back on sometime.
[02:01:12.006 --> 02:01:13.667]  Obviously, an hour is not enough.
[02:01:14.127 --> 02:01:24.254]  But just talk about what you witnessed in Iraq and what it was like to be under continual bombardment and then to have part of the prison walled off by people out of your authority.
[02:01:25.885 --> 02:01:33.208]  I mean, I don't know how they could try to scapegoat you when it was part of the record that you weren't in control of that wing of the prison.
[02:01:33.448 --> 02:01:40.611]  Because they thought it was going to be easy to do so, and they believed that they would be able to silence soldiers from giving sworn statements to the contrary.
[02:01:41.291 --> 02:01:42.972]  And soldiers will not lie.
[02:01:42.992 --> 02:01:46.113]  They'll answer honestly.
[02:01:46.693 --> 02:01:48.834]  And soldiers have been telling the truth.
[02:01:49.274 --> 02:01:50.915]  And I know the truth.
[02:01:50.975 --> 02:01:53.856]  I knew the truth all along, so I will just continue to pursue it.
[02:01:54.884 --> 02:02:01.449]  Well, General, I really appreciate you joining us, and tell us just in the last 30 seconds here a little bit more about your book.
[02:02:02.509 --> 02:02:05.711]  I think that the book is not a story about Abu Ghraib.
[02:02:05.771 --> 02:02:10.895]  However, it culminates with my career and how I got to Abu Ghraib.
[02:02:11.585 --> 02:02:15.667]  And credibility is established, and then you can understand another side of the story.
[02:02:15.727 --> 02:02:19.428]  And I think that people need to understand all sides of the story.
[02:02:19.928 --> 02:02:20.889]  One woman's army.
[02:02:21.429 --> 02:02:22.189]  One woman's army.
[02:02:22.209 --> 02:02:23.330]  We've all got to tell everybody.
[02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:28.712]  Anytime you hear about General being demonized, Karpinski, tell them the truth.
[02:02:29.872 --> 02:02:32.353]  General, thanks again, and I look forward to having you back on in the future.
[02:02:32.433 --> 02:02:33.053]  Well, thank you.
[02:02:33.093 --> 02:02:34.134]  I look forward to it as well.
[02:02:34.334 --> 02:02:34.714]  God bless.
[02:02:35.788 --> 02:02:39.511]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, and good questions callers.
[02:02:39.531 --> 02:02:41.472]  We'll be right back with Mr. Ritter.
[02:02:41.933 --> 02:02:45.135]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.756 --> 02:02:50.059]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.259 --> 02:02:54.722]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.862 --> 02:02:59.286]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.306 --> 02:03:00.607]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.388 --> 02:03:06.611]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.671 --> 02:03:13.595]  We've ripped the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and revealed the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.735 --> 02:03:15.797]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.097 --> 02:03:26.444]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.744 --> 02:03:30.487]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[02:03:31.067 --> 02:03:31.107]  888-253-3139.
[02:03:31.127 --> 02:03:33.388]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:49.054]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.414 --> 02:03:58.224]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:03.230]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:10.413]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:10.813 --> 02:04:22.599]  It also removes foul-tasted odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:23.059 --> 02:04:27.524]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:27.705 --> 02:04:30.168]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:30.188 --> 02:04:32.010]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:04:45.066 --> 02:04:48.007]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[02:04:48.127 --> 02:04:50.367]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[02:04:50.728 --> 02:04:52.728]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[02:04:52.888 --> 02:04:55.349]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[02:04:55.429 --> 02:04:58.430]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[02:04:58.630 --> 02:04:59.850]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:05.492]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[02:05:05.572 --> 02:05:10.173]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease as well as undue emotional stress.
[02:05:10.493 --> 02:05:16.677]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[02:05:16.898 --> 02:05:22.822]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[02:05:23.142 --> 02:05:28.906]  The Unmedical Miracle Oxygen is a book that will show you safe, easy ways to increase your body's oxygen level.

[02:05:37.712 --> 02:05:40.955]  That's 888-224-7416.
[02:05:42.476 --> 02:05:48.100]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.543]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.004 --> 02:06:04.612]  We just had Brigadier General Janice Karpinski on for an entire hour talking about the total tyranny, police state evil of our government.
[02:06:05.293 --> 02:06:06.714]  That is the criminal elements of it.
[02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:11.712]  We've had Ron Paul on saying Bush is preparing for martial law and gun confiscation.
[02:06:12.192 --> 02:06:16.215]  Medical doctor, Vietnam veteran, most conservative member of Congress.
[02:06:17.136 --> 02:06:20.518]  We've had Ray McGovern on saying the government may carry out terror attacks.
[02:06:21.318 --> 02:06:23.280]  And the article's up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:06:25.021 --> 02:06:26.342]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:06:27.242 --> 02:06:36.007]  I mean, I have multiple members of Bush's cabinet and directors and Deputy Treasury Secretary coming on and saying the same thing.
[02:06:36.067 --> 02:06:39.288]  And Morgan Reynolds and Chief Economist.
[02:06:39.328 --> 02:06:44.491]  I mean, it's just... Look, people say that good folks wouldn't stand up and tell the truth.
[02:06:44.771 --> 02:06:45.432]  They are!
[02:06:46.472 --> 02:06:49.854]  I mean, Ron Paul sounding as radical or more radical than I do.
[02:06:49.894 --> 02:06:51.695]  I mean, Ray McGovern coming out.
[02:06:51.735 --> 02:06:53.576]  The government, you know, unsolicited.
[02:06:53.616 --> 02:06:55.437]  He says the government might carry out terror.
[02:06:56.072 --> 02:06:59.373]  I mean, that sounded like a fruit loop to most people four years ago, saying that.
[02:07:00.113 --> 02:07:02.833]  But just how much more do you need?
[02:07:03.714 --> 02:07:07.654]  They catch British troops running around in wigs and beards with bombs, shooting people.
[02:07:07.795 --> 02:07:11.975]  It goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:07:11.995 --> 02:07:12.796]  There's just so much.
[02:07:12.816 --> 02:07:15.516]  We're about to be talking to Scott Ritter for the rest of this hour.
[02:07:15.536 --> 02:07:17.156]  We'll take calls the last 15 minutes or so.
[02:07:17.176 --> 02:07:22.198]  I'm really honored to have him joining us, and we'll tell you all about his new book, which is a doozy.
[02:07:22.818 --> 02:07:24.118]  But before I go any further...
[02:07:25.254 --> 02:07:36.917]  I'm going to be showing my new film, The Order of Death, documenting all the bizarre activities of the global elite, and the new cut-down, remastered Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:36.977 --> 02:07:42.239]  Two films, one screening, and I'll give a speech and have a question and answer after.
[02:07:42.799 --> 02:07:47.280]  Coming up this Thursday, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:49.461]  We had two showings a few weeks ago.
[02:07:49.481 --> 02:07:51.981]  They were both overflow crowds, so they asked me to have another one.
[02:07:52.281 --> 02:07:53.562]  This is the last one.
[02:07:53.622 --> 02:07:54.302]  It's going to be great.
[02:07:55.006 --> 02:08:00.050]  If you live in Austin and you haven't been to the Alamo Draft House South, it's a beautiful stadium seating, you know, theaters.
[02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:00.910]  They've got five screens.
[02:08:00.930 --> 02:08:02.051]  It'll be in their biggest theater.
[02:08:02.531 --> 02:08:04.233]  They've got food, drinks, everything.
[02:08:04.893 --> 02:08:07.235]  And go to InfoWars.com.
[02:08:07.675 --> 02:08:11.037]  Link through and buy your tickets beforehand before they sell out.
[02:08:11.538 --> 02:08:15.320]  There are some tickets left, but usually they sell out a few days beforehand.
[02:08:15.701 --> 02:08:16.161]  Go now.
[02:08:16.241 --> 02:08:16.801]  Get your tickets.
[02:08:16.841 --> 02:08:17.722]  I really want to see you there.
[02:08:17.742 --> 02:08:18.663]  It's going to be a great event.
[02:08:19.043 --> 02:08:24.527]  Go to InfoWars.com and link through to the DraftHouse.com, Alamo Draft House.
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:30.781]  And get your tickets, or if you're driving around on South Lamar, pull into the Alamo Draft House.
[02:08:30.801 --> 02:08:32.342]  You can buy your tickets at the door early.
[02:08:33.962 --> 02:08:37.243]  Or you can try to buy them that day, and we'll tell you if there's any tickets left that day.
[02:08:37.283 --> 02:08:38.083]  There never has been.
[02:08:39.003 --> 02:08:45.685]  I think I've shown films here in Austin about 15 times in the last four or five years.
[02:08:48.145 --> 02:08:49.986]  The first time I showed a film was about four years ago.
[02:08:50.006 --> 02:08:52.026]  So in the last four years, about 15 times.
[02:08:52.066 --> 02:08:53.707]  And they've always sold out beforehand.
[02:08:54.607 --> 02:08:54.787]  So...
[02:08:55.874 --> 02:08:57.740]  There are some tickets left, so be sure and get them.
[02:08:57.821 --> 02:08:59.285]  Infowars.com.
[02:08:59.305 --> 02:09:02.275]  And if you want hard copies of any of my documentaries,
[02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:12.874]  Whether it's Road to Tyranny or The Masters of Terror or my new miniseries, Martial Law, that covers 9-11, the police state, and the globalist master plan, who's controlling Bush.
[02:09:13.174 --> 02:09:13.974]  He's just a puppet.
[02:09:14.214 --> 02:09:15.155]  It's all evidence.
[02:09:15.235 --> 02:09:16.115]  It's all documented.
[02:09:16.135 --> 02:09:17.236]  You need to get this film.
[02:09:17.656 --> 02:09:24.520]  Go to infowars.com or presentplanet.com and order the documentaries via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[02:09:36.307 --> 02:09:37.428]  Or for somebody's birthday.

[02:09:40.911 --> 02:09:42.352]  Give them My Film Road to Tyranny.
[02:09:42.392 --> 02:09:43.613]  Give them Martial Law.
[02:09:44.493 --> 02:09:46.595]  This is how we're going to turn this country around.
[02:09:47.115 --> 02:09:48.696]  If we don't, I mean, it's over.
[02:09:49.237 --> 02:09:50.758]  So please call and get the videos.
[02:09:50.778 --> 02:09:52.419]  Take advantage of the new specials we're offering.
[02:09:52.959 --> 02:09:54.060]  Three DVDs for $45.
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:58.003]  I mean, that's an insane discount of like 30-something bucks.
[02:09:59.187 --> 02:10:00.148]  Here's the toll-free number.
[02:10:00.168 --> 02:10:00.588]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:10:00.608 --> 02:10:12.214]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:10:14.095 --> 02:10:14.515]  All right.
[02:10:15.096 --> 02:10:18.037]  Let's go now to our guest, who I appreciate holding.
[02:10:18.898 --> 02:10:24.941]  And his new book, folks, is Iraq Confidential is a Dramatic Never-Before-Told Exposé.
[02:10:25.991 --> 02:10:31.134]  Of intelligence espionage by a staunch patriot the CIA wanted to silence.
[02:10:31.734 --> 02:10:37.717]  This first-hand account reveals in detail how the CIA manipulated and sabotaged the work of U.N.
[02:10:37.737 --> 02:10:39.818]  departments who achieved the U.S.'
[02:10:39.778 --> 02:10:41.899]  's hidden, and I'd say a criminal group in the U.S.'
[02:10:41.839 --> 02:10:44.300]  's, hidden foreign policy agenda in the Middle East.
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:49.703]  Iraq Confidential is an astonishing revelation of the CIA's imperial arrogance.
[02:10:50.872 --> 02:10:52.534]  And Scott Ritter, U.N.
[02:10:52.574 --> 02:10:57.478]  weapons inspector, a major in the Marine Corps, totally vindicated, joins us.
[02:10:57.518 --> 02:11:00.580]  We've seen the repercussions he's been through, others have been through.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.923]  We've seen what they tried to do to the ambassador's wife.
[02:11:05.204 --> 02:11:07.666]  All of that now coming home to roost.
[02:11:07.706 --> 02:11:08.727]  Good to have you on, Mr. Ritter.
[02:11:08.747 --> 02:11:09.707]  It's my pleasure.
[02:11:09.767 --> 02:11:10.008]  Thank you.
[02:11:10.368 --> 02:11:10.868]  You bet.
[02:11:11.309 --> 02:11:15.572]  The new book, Iraq Confidential, I mean, it's a slam dunk book.
[02:11:16.241 --> 02:11:21.604]  It just codifies even more evidence of the premeditated lies bringing us to war.
[02:11:22.345 --> 02:11:23.245]  Break it down for us.
[02:11:23.786 --> 02:11:29.549]  Well, I mean, I hesitate to use the term slam dunk because that's been spoiled by George Tenet making the opposite case.
[02:11:31.611 --> 02:11:32.871]  That was my intention.
[02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:43.918]  Look, today we're in Iraq, and I think it's widely acknowledged, regardless of where you stood before the war, that it's an unmitigated disaster.
[02:11:43.958 --> 02:11:44.979]  I mean, we're...
[02:11:45.683 --> 02:11:48.025]  We're up to our neck in a mess of our own making.
[02:11:49.627 --> 02:11:53.930]  Now we're having a discussion about how do we get out of this?
[02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:55.672]  What's the solution?
[02:11:55.752 --> 02:12:05.180]  One of the things I've always said, and this is what I was taught as an intelligence officer, is that you can't solve a problem until you first define the problem.
[02:12:05.741 --> 02:12:10.985]  On Iraq, we still haven't come to grips with the fact that our government misled us.
[02:12:12.663 --> 02:12:14.264]  I think we're good to go.
[02:12:14.284 --> 02:12:15.084]  We're good to go.
[02:12:42.153 --> 02:12:49.897]  That the numbers that it was passing on to the President were deceptive, were misleading, were falsified.
[02:12:50.538 --> 02:12:58.322]  And I back this up further by reminding Americans, because they do need to be reminded, that this was never about disarmament.
[02:12:58.362 --> 02:13:09.388]  I mean, I don't know why we all got fooled, at least some of us got fooled, into believing that George W. Bush wanted to disarm Iraq, because Bill Clinton before him did not want to disarm Iraq.
[02:13:09.998 --> 02:13:14.081]  And George Bush's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, didn't want to disarm Iraq.
[02:13:14.101 --> 02:13:19.726]  The only policy objective that was in play during the entire decade of the 90s was regime change.
[02:13:20.086 --> 02:13:33.477]  And disarmament, the work of the weapons inspectors, was only useful insofar as it facilitated regime change, either by providing an excuse for the maintenance of economic sanctions that killed between 700,000 and 2.2 million Iraqis during the 1990s, or to use as a Trojan horse,
[02:13:37.393 --> 02:13:37.673]  I think so.
[02:13:59.855 --> 02:14:11.657]  Without question, if anybody dared raise their hand, as I did, and said, well, wait a minute, I'm not out here to support Saddam, but the facts are what they're telling you is not true, you immediately became associated as being pro-Saddam.
[02:14:11.697 --> 02:14:13.878]  Therefore, your information was discarded.
[02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:17.538]  Well, we're talking to Scott Ritter, who, of course, was one of the U.S.
[02:14:17.698 --> 02:14:18.838]  weapons inspectors over there.
[02:14:18.858 --> 02:14:21.499]  I mean, several points.
[02:14:21.599 --> 02:14:24.539]  Number one, you say that now everybody agrees and everybody knows.
[02:14:25.039 --> 02:14:28.020]  Even the White House admits there's no WMDs, but...
[02:14:28.985 --> 02:14:32.906]  The neocon talk radio people, they still say they found them and they had them.
[02:14:32.926 --> 02:14:39.869]  Because remember, for like three months when they first invaded, in 03 in March, every day they found a new nerve gas shell.
[02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:48.172]  Of course, it would show the inspector unscrewing the top and sticking their nose in it, as if anybody who really thinks you're dealing with chemical weapons sticks your nose in it.
[02:14:48.212 --> 02:14:49.112]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[02:14:49.132 --> 02:14:51.713]  I mean, you don't even mess with them if you think they're chemical.
[02:14:51.753 --> 02:14:53.634]  You ship them off to be destroyed.
[02:14:54.594 --> 02:14:57.617]  We have all these other problems happening.
[02:14:57.757 --> 02:15:01.500]  And then now Rumsfeld's gotten on TV and said, it was never about WMDs.
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:03.162]  I never said they had WMDs.
[02:15:03.442 --> 02:15:04.323]  It's an urban legend.
[02:15:04.923 --> 02:15:10.228]  So now we've kind of reached a level of Orwellian doublespeak that is just staggering.
[02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:12.789]  Bringing them democracy.
[02:15:12.829 --> 02:15:14.270]  That's what we were always there for.
[02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:15.650]  And then you leave and look at that.
[02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:16.770]  That's a fraud.
[02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:23.111]  They've given it back to the Baptist, and they've broken the place up, and the Constitution doesn't really give anybody any freedom.
[02:15:23.151 --> 02:15:24.372]  I mean, it's a total fraud.
[02:15:24.632 --> 02:15:25.532]  That's a fraud, too.
[02:15:26.332 --> 02:15:26.592]  Right.
[02:15:26.672 --> 02:15:32.173]  And again, the best way for people to come to grips with this is to understand that this was a fraud from day one.
[02:15:32.853 --> 02:15:34.354]  That there's no master plan.
[02:15:34.754 --> 02:15:39.355]  It's not as though the United States came into Iraq with any good intent in our heart.
[02:15:39.815 --> 02:15:40.295]  This was...
[02:15:41.150 --> 02:15:41.490]  I think so.
[02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.871]  I think so.
[02:16:01.696 --> 02:16:02.657]  Deliberately deceive.
[02:16:02.677 --> 02:16:06.801]  When you tell a lie in the conduct of your official duty... It's called a frame-up.
[02:16:07.181 --> 02:16:09.063]  It's called a frame-up bearing false witness.
[02:16:09.464 --> 02:16:10.645]  Yeah, and it's a crime.
[02:16:10.685 --> 02:16:13.127]  I mean, you know, we have an interesting situation here today, though.
[02:16:13.147 --> 02:16:20.254]  Yeah, if I claim my neighbor is robbing banks and the cops go raid his house and find out I just made that up, I'm going to jail.
[02:16:20.494 --> 02:16:21.015]  That's right.
[02:16:21.075 --> 02:16:23.958]  And, you know, Bill Clinton, and I'm no fan of Bill Clinton, but when he...
[02:16:24.697 --> 02:16:29.139]  He lied about a personal issue to a grand jury and Congress screamed impeachment.
[02:16:29.159 --> 02:16:30.719]  The fact is they did impeach him.
[02:16:30.759 --> 02:16:32.880]  They didn't make it, but they impeached him.
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:39.863]  Now you have Kay Bailey Hutchins, a senator from Texas, saying about Karl Rove and Scooter Libby and others,
[02:16:40.373 --> 02:16:44.616]  I hope that they're not going to be indicted for some perjury thing like that.
[02:16:44.676 --> 02:16:51.060]  I mean, you know, the fact that they might have said something that wasn't true to a grand jury, I mean, that's not really a big deal.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:52.681]  No, it's a huge deal, Kay Bailey.
[02:16:52.781 --> 02:16:55.162]  And if that's how you feel... Yeah, we went to war.
[02:16:55.182 --> 02:16:56.683]  We got thousands of dead troops.
[02:16:56.803 --> 02:16:57.184]  Well, it's the law.
[02:16:57.224 --> 02:16:59.065]  A hundred thousand dead Iraqis, you witch.
[02:16:59.085 --> 02:16:59.725]  She's a senator.
[02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:00.886]  It's the law.
[02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:05.009]  And if she thinks that perjury is okay, she should probably resign.
[02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:08.411]  Because, I don't know about you, but...
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:15.285]  If that was my senator saying it's okay to break the law... Well, she is my senator.
[02:17:15.385 --> 02:17:16.126]  Yeah, I know she is.
[02:17:16.146 --> 02:17:21.470]  She's not mine, but she's yours, and she's your listeners, and she should be run out of office for saying that.
[02:17:23.051 --> 02:17:23.372]  I know.
[02:17:23.452 --> 02:17:25.393]  It's just Twilight Zone weird.
[02:17:26.314 --> 02:17:28.356]  Stay there, talking to Mr. Ritter, Scott Ritter.
[02:17:28.916 --> 02:17:31.618]  New book is out, and it's powerful.
[02:17:31.698 --> 02:17:32.739]  I write confidential.
[02:17:32.759 --> 02:17:34.681]  I'll tell you about it all coming up.
[02:17:35.723 --> 02:17:36.244]  Just amazing.
[02:17:36.264 --> 02:17:40.374]  We'll give you some websites as well, and later we're going to take some calls.
[02:17:41.857 --> 02:17:43.742]  We've got to hold these people accountable.
[02:17:46.064 --> 02:17:49.427]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:17:49.687 --> 02:17:50.007]  Why?
[02:17:50.027 --> 02:17:52.969]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:17:53.049 --> 02:17:57.993]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:17:58.133 --> 02:18:07.840]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:15.466]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping, a 30% savings off the regular price.
[02:18:15.606 --> 02:18:16.827]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[02:18:16.847 --> 02:18:20.089]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[02:18:47.037 --> 02:18:56.103]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:18:56.363 --> 02:19:07.591]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:19:07.931 --> 02:19:13.655]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problems.
[02:19:13.875 --> 02:19:14.555]  We're good to go.
[02:19:38.529 --> 02:19:42.413]  Here it is, folks.
[02:19:42.553 --> 02:19:48.859]  The 2006 Red Book.
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.862]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[02:19:52.603 --> 02:19:56.266]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[02:19:57.027 --> 02:19:58.488]  It includes a history of U.S.
[02:19:58.568 --> 02:19:58.969]  coins.
[02:19:59.668 --> 02:20:00.869]  We're good to go.

[02:22:03.610 --> 02:22:06.557]  Well, this is a good song for Scott Ritter, the UN weapons inspector.
[02:22:06.577 --> 02:22:12.852]  Scott, I mean, in the early days, when did you finally decide to start going public?
[02:22:13.482 --> 02:22:16.463]  When did you finally start deciding to go, look, this is all lies?
[02:22:16.483 --> 02:22:29.425]  I mean, your book's about the many years before that, being in Iraq, knowing the truth, and then secondarily, how did they get other inspectors above you, or people they'd replace you with, to come out and lie?
[02:22:29.765 --> 02:22:32.125]  And then now they've been forced to admit, quote, they were wrong.
[02:22:32.145 --> 02:22:33.126]  Well, they weren't wrong.
[02:22:33.566 --> 02:22:35.086]  I mean, they were lying, weren't they?
[02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:38.627]  Well, Mo, first of all, they would get former inspectors.
[02:22:38.687 --> 02:22:40.747]  I don't think they got any inspectors on duty.
[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:48.683]  You know, I was an inspector from 1991 to 1998, and we knew early on in 1991 that we had a problem with the United States.
[02:22:48.883 --> 02:22:54.826]  The United States had a policy of regime change that was corrupting the integrity of our operation.
[02:22:54.886 --> 02:22:58.607]  But the United States was also a member of the Security Council of the United Nations.
[02:22:58.627 --> 02:23:00.448]  There were a lot of people out there that bad-mouthed the UN.
[02:23:01.129 --> 02:23:01.829]  And pick on the UN.
[02:23:01.869 --> 02:23:06.151]  I'm not here to defend a bureaucracy that definitely needs some reforming.
[02:23:06.191 --> 02:23:10.613]  But we should never forget that the United Nations... Our government founded the UN.
[02:23:10.633 --> 02:23:12.033]  It basically runs it.
[02:23:12.293 --> 02:23:12.913]  It's a club.
[02:23:13.173 --> 02:23:14.434]  And we have rules.
[02:23:14.514 --> 02:23:15.474]  It's called the Charter.
[02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:26.218]  And when the United States decides not to play by the rules, and yet tell everybody else to play by the rules, that corrupts the integrity of that organization.
[02:23:26.258 --> 02:23:28.159]  And the United States was a member of the Security Council...
[02:23:28.703 --> 02:23:29.224]  We're good to go.
[02:23:49.231 --> 02:23:50.411]  On the work of the inspectors.
[02:23:50.431 --> 02:24:02.674]  Well, we also know that for the year of the build-up, when they were, quote, dealing with Saddam and offering him deals and stuff, that Bush had already told Tony Blair, we are attacking them in the spring.
[02:24:03.174 --> 02:24:03.894]  End of story.
[02:24:03.914 --> 02:24:06.995]  I mean, it was all a, you know... It's all a lie.
[02:24:07.175 --> 02:24:10.575]  That four-day ultimatum, I mean, all of that was just theater.
[02:24:10.815 --> 02:24:11.095]  Yes.
[02:24:11.975 --> 02:24:14.416]  Well, and going to the United Nations to see a theater that...
[02:24:14.836 --> 02:24:16.197]  It dramatically backfired.
[02:24:16.417 --> 02:24:18.538]  It blew up in the face of the Bush administration.
[02:24:18.558 --> 02:24:22.979]  Why do you think Powell played along with that and went and lied for him and now says he's embarrassed?
[02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:23.640]  Well, I don't know.
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:27.721]  Ultimately, Colin Powell will be judged by history by that one day.
[02:24:27.782 --> 02:24:40.867]  Here's a man who had, by any account, a distinguished career working for several administrations, and he blew it all in one day because he didn't have the courage to stand up and say no if he had resigned.
[02:24:41.405 --> 02:24:43.265]  If he'd come out and said, I'm not going to play this game.
[02:24:43.285 --> 02:24:44.326]  I'm not going to fabricate.
[02:24:44.606 --> 02:24:45.446]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:24:45.726 --> 02:24:47.006]  This is my letter of resignation.
[02:24:47.046 --> 02:24:52.208]  And furthermore, as an American, once I resign, Mr. President, I'm going to tell the people the truth about your administration.
[02:24:52.228 --> 02:24:53.588]  You know, he'd be a hero today.
[02:24:54.168 --> 02:24:54.888]  He'd be a hero.
[02:24:54.908 --> 02:24:56.869]  He'd probably be presidential material.
[02:24:56.889 --> 02:24:58.869]  Well, Scott, why did you refuse to lie?
[02:24:58.929 --> 02:25:02.770]  I mean, you're sitting there, and you know you're going to get major heat for doing this.
[02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:05.971]  And these people come after folks.
[02:25:05.991 --> 02:25:06.811]  It's not an option.
[02:25:07.351 --> 02:25:10.892]  You know, the Marine Corps doesn't condone liars.
[02:25:11.431 --> 02:25:11.731]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.790]  Absolutely.
[02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:40.077]  And when you have a society where everybody rolls over, I mean, it's a slippery slope.
[02:25:40.137 --> 02:25:42.120]  I mean, this is tyranny we're talking about.
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.126]  It is, especially, you know, the checks and balances that are in place have failed egregiously.
[02:25:47.166 --> 02:25:49.749]  You know, Congress has totally abrogated its responsibilities.
[02:25:49.789 --> 02:25:51.231]  And again, Kay Bailey Hutchins.
[02:25:52.635 --> 02:25:55.656]  She must be held accountable for that attitude, for that mindset.
[02:25:55.956 --> 02:25:57.436]  What would you like to see happen?
[02:25:57.616 --> 02:25:58.217]  What would you like?
[02:25:58.277 --> 02:26:01.817]  I mean, in a perfect world, Scott Ritter's king for a day, what would happen?
[02:26:02.138 --> 02:26:08.399]  Well, I mean, things are so badly... But the first thing I'd like to happen is to purge Congress of everybody who voted yes for that war.
[02:26:09.239 --> 02:26:15.821]  If you voted yes for that war, and you haven't come out and repudiated that vote, said I made a mistake, that I was misled...
[02:26:16.665 --> 02:26:23.670]  And that I won't continue to vote to support this war, then you have no right representing the United States, the American people.
[02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:24.351]  Well, I agree.
[02:26:24.371 --> 02:26:25.892]  There's a type of schizophrenia.
[02:26:25.932 --> 02:26:30.775]  I know so many Democrats that hate the war and hate Bush, but they love Hillary, they love Chuckie Schumer.
[02:26:32.096 --> 02:26:39.762]  That's the hypocrisy of it, because Hillary Clinton, she's the same problem, just coded, dressed differently.
[02:26:40.782 --> 02:26:44.365]  She has embraced the same...
[02:26:44.847 --> 02:26:45.307]  I think so.
[02:27:05.439 --> 02:27:09.301]  The far right wing of the Republican Party out of fear of having their weakness exposed.
[02:27:09.461 --> 02:27:11.762]  I've actually had arguments with Democrats in the most of them.
[02:27:11.802 --> 02:27:13.003]  It's like they have a mental block.
[02:27:13.323 --> 02:27:14.844]  No, the Democrats didn't vote for the war.
[02:27:15.364 --> 02:27:16.204]  Yes, they did.
[02:27:16.285 --> 02:27:19.546]  In some cases, they're voting more with Bush than Republicans are.
[02:27:20.727 --> 02:27:22.267]  It's unbelievably disgusting.
[02:27:22.448 --> 02:27:23.448]  Scott, stay there.
[02:27:24.168 --> 02:27:30.672]  I want to talk about what's happening with the war now and where you think it's all going and talk about your new book, Iraq Confidential.
[02:27:31.012 --> 02:27:31.952]  And we'll take some calls.
[02:27:32.353 --> 02:27:33.033]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:27:35.902 --> 02:27:36.805]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.307 --> 02:27:38.912]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.835 --> 02:27:42.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.496 --> 02:27:49.977]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:27:50.158 --> 02:27:54.081]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:27:54.381 --> 02:28:01.687]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste spill is something we all face every day.
[02:28:01.968 --> 02:28:03.889]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[02:28:04.189 --> 02:28:10.975]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:28:11.295 --> 02:28:14.158]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[02:28:14.438 --> 02:28:19.881]  Your nuclear alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[02:28:20.161 --> 02:28:21.522]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:22.362 --> 02:28:27.084]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear alert today.
[02:28:27.364 --> 02:28:30.606]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:28:30.946 --> 02:28:35.448]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:28:35.729 --> 02:28:35.929]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:38.731 --> 02:28:42.701]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nook Alert today.
[02:28:42.842 --> 02:28:43.303]  Nook Alert.
[02:28:43.584 --> 02:28:44.647]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:28:46.454 --> 02:28:51.419]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:53.982]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:28:54.042 --> 02:28:57.185]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:57.205 --> 02:29:01.510]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:04.873]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:05.173 --> 02:29:08.617]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.937 --> 02:29:18.284]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.544 --> 02:29:22.047]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:22.287 --> 02:29:29.393]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:46.292 --> 02:29:53.177]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:29:53.297 --> 02:30:06.226]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Stobie, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:30:06.406 --> 02:30:08.207]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:30:08.387 --> 02:30:08.967]  We're good to go.
[02:30:27.583 --> 02:30:29.444]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:30:44.031 --> 02:30:54.976]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:02.452 --> 02:31:07.193]  You know, the CIA would like you to believe that it was just a few rogue people in there.
[02:31:07.333 --> 02:31:23.017]  And obviously it is compartmentalized that we're putting out fake intelligence, but we're going to talk a little bit about the history of sabotage continually and trying to inject lies perpetually into the weapons inspection process.
[02:31:23.077 --> 02:31:30.139]  But talking to Scott Ritter, United Nations weapons inspector who bravely went public
[02:31:31.047 --> 02:31:32.748]  I'm not going to be part of these lies.
[02:31:33.088 --> 02:31:35.529]  There are no WMDs when our government knows it.
[02:31:36.109 --> 02:31:37.530]  Scott, look at this article last week.
[02:31:38.050 --> 02:31:39.071]  Financial Times of London.
[02:31:39.111 --> 02:31:39.871]  I'm sure you heard about this.
[02:31:40.352 --> 02:31:41.932]  Cheney Cabal hijacked U.S.
[02:31:41.972 --> 02:31:42.693]  foreign policy.
[02:31:42.713 --> 02:31:49.296]  We've got Colin Powell's chief deputy, a bunch of other people, and these are Rockefeller, Republican, New World Order types themselves.
[02:31:49.876 --> 02:31:52.437]  But even they are calling them crazy hijackers.
[02:31:52.477 --> 02:31:53.657]  But I want to just go, wait a minute.
[02:31:54.157 --> 02:31:55.758]  Isn't this kind of good cop, bad cop?
[02:31:55.998 --> 02:32:04.560]  Either you accept that you went in there telling you to let us inspect and take your country over, or we'll send in the evil neocon right-wingers.
[02:32:06.881 --> 02:32:10.142]  Basically, I've brought up a couple of different points, but would you like to comment on those?
[02:32:10.722 --> 02:32:15.143]  Well, one of the things that strikes me, I mean, first of all, the United States isn't playing it right.
[02:32:15.483 --> 02:32:17.724]  It's not about good cop, bad cop.
[02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:20.411]  It's about due process.
[02:32:20.471 --> 02:32:21.632]  It's about doing the right thing.
[02:32:22.032 --> 02:32:25.654]  If you want to take out Saddam, be honest about it.
[02:32:25.694 --> 02:32:27.455]  Let's have that debate, etc.
[02:32:27.475 --> 02:32:33.218]  But we told the world we simply wanted to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, and then we create the double standard.
[02:32:33.238 --> 02:32:37.100]  We create the new mission objective, and we're not honest about it.
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:38.621]  I find it peculiar.
[02:32:39.041 --> 02:32:46.525]  Again, I'm glad that Colonel Wilkerson and others are speaking out now, but it's just a little too cute for them to be jumping ship now that it's sinking.
[02:32:47.332 --> 02:32:51.773]  It would have been nice if they had jumped ship before the ship ran into an iceberg.
[02:32:52.053 --> 02:32:53.534]  Yeah, but what did Mark Twain say?
[02:32:53.554 --> 02:33:03.096]  He said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared, but in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:33:03.537 --> 02:33:06.637]  And these people will not pay a price, and they should.
[02:33:07.358 --> 02:33:08.398]  Wilkerson was around.
[02:33:08.806 --> 02:33:10.227]  When Powell gave his speech.
[02:33:10.687 --> 02:33:14.408]  Wilkerson's quite aware of the falsification of data that took place.
[02:33:14.668 --> 02:33:16.249]  For those who don't know, tell us about Wilkerson.
[02:33:16.669 --> 02:33:21.731]  Well, he's a colonel who's a military aide to Colin Powell, and he's been a loyal aide.
[02:33:21.751 --> 02:33:28.314]  You know, cut out the same piece of cloth that Powell is, where you don't speak out against your superiors, you salute smartly.
[02:33:28.674 --> 02:33:34.516]  But one of the problems is they forget that their oath isn't, you know, his oath isn't to Colin Powell, his oath isn't to the President.
[02:33:35.023 --> 02:33:37.664]  His oath is to the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:33:38.025 --> 02:33:38.545]  Good point.
[02:33:38.565 --> 02:33:44.188]  A lot of people think patriotism is worshipping whoever the leader is, and folks, that's called dictatorship.
[02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:45.288]  It's very dangerous.
[02:33:45.308 --> 02:33:57.975]  You know, Theodore Roosevelt, again, I'll paraphrase it because I don't have the exact quote, but not to criticize a president, especially during times of war, is not only morally cowardly, but it bores on treasonous.
[02:33:58.215 --> 02:34:01.757]  I mean, it's our duty and responsibility as American citizens
[02:34:02.293 --> 02:34:06.058]  To hold our elected representatives accountable for what they do in our name.
[02:34:06.378 --> 02:34:09.963]  We cannot accept the notion of you're either with us or against us.
[02:34:10.323 --> 02:34:11.845]  That's absurd in a democracy.
[02:34:13.467 --> 02:34:16.291]  Or really absurd in a constitutional republic.
[02:34:16.611 --> 02:34:17.332]  Absolutely.
[02:34:17.632 --> 02:34:19.535]  Because you know the danger of a pure democracy.
[02:34:20.123 --> 02:34:22.625]  You're going to get the lecture, because if I don't, I'll get the lecture.
[02:34:22.665 --> 02:34:23.425]  You'll get the lecture.
[02:34:23.825 --> 02:34:24.606]  Well, it's important.
[02:34:24.626 --> 02:34:26.107]  I mean, I know what you're saying.
[02:34:26.127 --> 02:34:27.008]  I'm not trying to lecture.
[02:34:27.448 --> 02:34:31.610]  But in a democracy, 51% of people say, take that guy's land, it happens.
[02:34:31.891 --> 02:34:37.774]  But in a republic, there's even more safeguards where the minority's rights are protected as well as the majority's.
[02:34:37.794 --> 02:34:38.015]  Absolutely.
[02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:40.836]  Well, that's what the Constitution is supposed to do, is protect.
[02:34:41.577 --> 02:34:42.798]  It's not there for the majority.
[02:34:43.558 --> 02:34:44.619]  It's there for the minority.
[02:34:44.679 --> 02:34:47.721]  It's there to make sure that we don't have the tyranny of the majority.
[02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:50.491]  Well, I mean, where does all the... Well, you're right, Scott.
[02:34:50.531 --> 02:34:51.632]  Where does all this go?
[02:34:51.732 --> 02:35:06.280]  I mean, if they just burn a Scooter Libby or a Rove and then Bush pardons them and they go and get CEO jobs at $15 million a year, I mean, they're just little mid-level functionaries.
[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:08.501]  I mean, what would you like to see happen?
[02:35:08.541 --> 02:35:09.482]  People need to be punished.
[02:35:09.502 --> 02:35:12.223]  I mean, I know you said clean Congress out.
[02:35:12.563 --> 02:35:13.824]  I totally agree with you.
[02:35:14.604 --> 02:35:14.784]  But...
[02:35:16.005 --> 02:35:17.186]  I mean, something more.
[02:35:17.206 --> 02:35:19.627]  I think the President needs to go to prison.
[02:35:20.007 --> 02:35:21.388]  Well, yeah.
[02:35:21.688 --> 02:35:26.730]  In an ideal world, first of all, let's be fair, we can't convict somebody until we try.
[02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:33.333]  So I think the President should be investigated to determine whether or not he has committed a crime.
[02:35:33.914 --> 02:35:39.438]  And if a crime has been committed, then the president must be held accountable, fully accountable to the rule of law.
[02:35:39.518 --> 02:35:41.199]  But that should be by a grand jury.
[02:35:41.239 --> 02:35:43.661]  It shouldn't be by some blue-ribbon committee he appoints.
[02:35:43.741 --> 02:35:46.343]  No, of course not.
[02:35:46.383 --> 02:35:50.346]  If it's not going to be by Congress, then it needs to be by a grand jury.
[02:35:50.366 --> 02:35:51.567]  It needs to be the civil crimes.
[02:35:51.867 --> 02:35:58.632]  But I'm also someone that says, look, if we're going to go after Bush, and I'm all for it, we've got to go after Clinton.
[02:35:59.011 --> 02:36:02.633]  We've got to go after the people in the Clinton administration.
[02:36:02.813 --> 02:36:03.234]  Amen!
[02:36:03.254 --> 02:36:03.914]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:36:03.934 --> 02:36:04.194]  Amen.
[02:36:04.314 --> 02:36:11.058]  And we've got to make sure that we set the record straight that this isn't about partisan bashing, Bush bashing.
[02:36:11.078 --> 02:36:12.679]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:36:12.739 --> 02:36:13.840]  That's how they control us.
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:20.904]  This is about reasserting the rule of law as set forth by the Constitution and reasserting...
[02:36:21.488 --> 02:36:22.749]  You know, the power of the people.
[02:36:22.789 --> 02:36:27.272]  Well, also, government, I mean, as you know, Scott, has gotten too big for its britches across the board.
[02:36:27.312 --> 02:36:32.255]  It's time for them to learn some humility and stop having this imperial hubris.
[02:36:32.555 --> 02:36:34.276]  Yeah, and there's no doubt about it.
[02:36:34.296 --> 02:36:39.340]  You know, it's also time for the American people maybe to reacquaint themselves with the Constitution.
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:43.262]  Read that, and read the opening paragraph, We the People of the United States.
[02:36:43.322 --> 02:36:44.203]  I mean, it's our document.
[02:36:44.403 --> 02:36:44.883]  It's our life.
[02:36:44.923 --> 02:36:45.544]  It's our country.
[02:36:46.685 --> 02:36:47.445]  It is America.
[02:36:47.565 --> 02:36:50.227]  We don't do very well by, you know,
[02:36:50.834 --> 02:36:59.681]  We don't serve our role as citizens by allowing an oligarchy or this tyranny of the minority to govern without any checks and balances.
[02:37:01.502 --> 02:37:02.123]  Absolutely.
[02:37:03.424 --> 02:37:04.405]  Beautifully said.
[02:37:05.886 --> 02:37:08.828]  And folks, by pushing, by speaking, by getting involved...
[02:37:09.597 --> 02:37:13.161]  Democrats, you have to stop mindlessly supporting Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[02:37:13.541 --> 02:37:20.508]  I mean, why do you think she has a four-hour dinner every week, according to the New York Daily News and New York Observer, with Rupert Murdoch?
[02:37:20.788 --> 02:37:21.749]  It's all staged.
[02:37:22.209 --> 02:37:25.112]  Why do you think Clinton constantly vacations with the Bushes?
[02:37:26.173 --> 02:37:29.136]  It is an insider cabal, and it's got to be removed.
[02:37:32.659 --> 02:37:34.101]  How do you see that happening, Scott?
[02:37:34.924 --> 02:37:39.326]  Well, again, I mean, it's not going to happen, A, until people wake up.
[02:37:39.366 --> 02:37:39.746]  And you're right.
[02:37:39.766 --> 02:37:40.587]  You mentioned it earlier.
[02:37:41.127 --> 02:37:49.211]  We have the Rush Limbaugh's of the world, the Sean Hannity's, and these other millied mouth, whatever you want to call them, people.
[02:37:49.431 --> 02:37:49.811]  Liberals.
[02:37:49.911 --> 02:37:51.932]  Ultra left-wing extremists.
[02:37:52.352 --> 02:37:53.152]  Or even right-wing.
[02:37:53.753 --> 02:37:54.893]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:37:54.913 --> 02:37:58.475]  They claim they're conservative, and Bush has doubled the growth rate of the government.
[02:37:58.575 --> 02:37:59.315]  It's pure bull.
[02:37:59.675 --> 02:38:01.256]  But these guys are sitting there.
[02:38:02.168 --> 02:38:07.609]  Just spouting lies, spouting vindictive, and they have brainwashed a certain portion of the country.
[02:38:07.629 --> 02:38:14.311]  It doesn't matter now that the President himself has said there are no WMDs, that all WMDs were destroyed in the summer of 1991.
[02:38:14.371 --> 02:38:15.811]  The President has recognized this.
[02:38:16.591 --> 02:38:25.873]  These people still say, not only were there WMDs, but we found them, that this war is justified, and there's a certain element that believes this.
[02:38:27.394 --> 02:38:29.274]  Unfortunately, we're going to have to sort of
[02:38:30.111 --> 02:38:34.194]  Well, you don't want to hear the stuff I hear them say about you and people I even know.
[02:38:34.594 --> 02:38:35.595]  And they've never served.
[02:38:35.615 --> 02:38:38.377]  They've never been over in Iraq for years in that hellhole.
[02:38:38.717 --> 02:38:41.839]  They've never done all the things you've done in all these dangerous places.
[02:38:41.879 --> 02:38:43.941]  And then you say, yeah, he's a commie.
[02:38:43.961 --> 02:38:46.122]  I don't like that ridder.
[02:38:46.502 --> 02:38:51.586]  Well, you know, look, there's enough Marine Corps left in me that if they really feel that way...
[02:38:52.225 --> 02:38:58.150]  They're welcome to come over here and say it to my face, and then we'll settle it the old-fashioned way.
[02:38:58.450 --> 02:38:59.871]  Well, it's just so pathetic.
[02:38:59.951 --> 02:39:04.135]  I'm an American patriot, and if you've got a problem with that, then I've got a problem with you.
[02:39:05.015 --> 02:39:05.856]  It's just that easy.
[02:39:07.097 --> 02:39:08.458]  But we shouldn't turn it to that level.
[02:39:08.478 --> 02:39:12.942]  This should be about something a little bit more than... No, I know.
[02:39:13.943 --> 02:39:16.084]  I'm just sick of all these little sycophants.
[02:39:16.505 --> 02:39:16.985]  Well, of course.
[02:39:17.425 --> 02:39:21.709]  But see, what happens is, when you engage people in a battle of ideas...
[02:39:22.148 --> 02:39:23.309]  And they come ill-equipped.
[02:39:23.890 --> 02:39:29.096]  The first thing they'll do is attack the speaker, not the ideas.
[02:39:30.767 --> 02:39:32.748]  The debate away from the issue at hand.
[02:39:32.828 --> 02:39:33.869]  I know, it's pure bull.
[02:39:34.189 --> 02:39:45.094]  I mean, so obviously you've heard what I've heard where they get on the radio every day and they say they found the WNDs and Scott Ritter's evil and anybody else who's against it is evil.
[02:39:45.134 --> 02:39:46.334]  Well, Ron Paul's against it.
[02:39:46.354 --> 02:39:49.276]  You know, all these other real conservatives are against it.
[02:39:49.336 --> 02:39:51.176]  I mean, it's a pack of lies.
[02:39:51.196 --> 02:39:55.678]  But again, they are hanging themselves with a rope that they themselves wove.
[02:39:56.279 --> 02:39:56.859]  Eventually...
[02:39:57.736 --> 02:40:02.965]  The beauty of all this vindictive that they spew, and it's not just the far right.
[02:40:03.025 --> 02:40:04.347]  It's mainstream media.
[02:40:04.367 --> 02:40:07.172]  The New York Times is collapsing
[02:40:08.766 --> 02:40:12.248]  Yeah, the readership's way down.
[02:40:12.288 --> 02:40:13.129]  They're having to let go.
[02:40:13.529 --> 02:40:14.349]  Hundreds of people.
[02:40:14.650 --> 02:40:15.130]  Exactly.
[02:40:15.450 --> 02:40:16.171]  They did this.
[02:40:16.651 --> 02:40:28.819]  Listen, Scott, I have not even near the biggest patriot, old-line conservative, truth-telling, whatever you want to call it, websites, but I'm bigger than major Texas newspapers.
[02:40:29.375 --> 02:40:30.956]  You know, just in the Internet writings.
[02:40:31.736 --> 02:40:38.019]  And we have millions and millions of listeners just on the Internet and just viewing the website every week.
[02:40:38.379 --> 02:40:40.000]  I mean, that's got to be hurting them.
[02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:45.602]  And we read about how their readerships across the board in the last ten years, newspaper readership down by 60%.
[02:40:47.183 --> 02:40:49.304]  Lions share that in the last two years.
[02:40:49.484 --> 02:40:51.005]  Nobody has confidence in them anymore.
[02:40:51.025 --> 02:40:58.648]  They've failed in their responsibility to serve the American public by telling the truth, by telling the facts.
[02:40:59.985 --> 02:41:03.007]  There is room for a position.
[02:41:03.247 --> 02:41:04.528]  That's called the editorial page.
[02:41:05.068 --> 02:41:10.992]  I have no problem with a publisher saying, okay, this is who I am and so here's my editorial page.
[02:41:11.012 --> 02:41:15.995]  Then they have something called the op-ed page where they can publish opposing points of view.
[02:41:17.136 --> 02:41:20.779]  That's wonderful because when we open up a newspaper and we see it, we know what we're getting.
[02:41:21.219 --> 02:41:28.284]  But when they take their editorializing into the news and start shaping stories, fabricating stories,
[02:41:28.817 --> 02:41:34.721]  And basically spoon-feeding things that aren't a reflection of reality to their readership.
[02:41:35.181 --> 02:41:35.862]  They've failed.
[02:41:35.922 --> 02:41:37.263]  And the New York Times did that.
[02:41:37.383 --> 02:41:38.543]  The Washington Post has done that.
[02:41:38.563 --> 02:41:40.385]  Well, Scott, what you've said has proven it.
[02:41:40.905 --> 02:41:55.815]  They like to act like it's just Bush and these frothing neokinds, but really the American establishment and Congress use them as their front men or their shock troops in this, and that's what I wanted to bring up to you, this larger program.
[02:41:56.515 --> 02:42:02.776]  There's the Pentagon program of P2OG, where Rumsfeld said, we want to stimulate terror attacks.
[02:42:03.016 --> 02:42:04.477]  We want things to break down.
[02:42:04.717 --> 02:42:05.857]  We want civil war.
[02:42:05.937 --> 02:42:07.197]  We want a weak government.
[02:42:07.457 --> 02:42:11.938]  We want, in failing, we win, because then we get to stay there for decades.
[02:42:12.398 --> 02:42:13.699]  Your take on that?
[02:42:14.239 --> 02:42:25.121]  Well, I think that, again, I have trouble giving the Pentagon credit for having this detailed conspiracy theory
[02:42:26.246 --> 02:42:28.768]  I'm sure that this is there, etc.
[02:42:29.048 --> 02:42:30.730]  But they're making it up every day.
[02:42:31.330 --> 02:42:33.271]  It's not as though they're working off a master plan.
[02:42:34.032 --> 02:42:36.274]  What we're seeing is incompetence personified.
[02:42:36.854 --> 02:42:49.063]  Rumsfeld and Cheney and the rest of them have hoodwinked everybody because they get on national TV and the media throws softball questions to them and they have this calm demeanor and they speak high and mighty.
[02:42:49.383 --> 02:42:52.165]  Everybody goes, wow, these guys know what they're talking about.
[02:42:52.245 --> 02:42:53.486]  But when push comes to shove...
[02:42:54.116 --> 02:42:55.636]  You know, they're liars.
[02:42:56.036 --> 02:42:58.377]  There's no depth to them.
[02:42:58.397 --> 02:43:00.717]  They're very thin in terms of... But Scott, you just said it.
[02:43:00.737 --> 02:43:01.757]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:43:01.797 --> 02:43:09.639]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, supposed liberal bastions, corporate interests wanted this war, so they let the neocons be the instruments of that.
[02:43:09.979 --> 02:43:14.760]  They then take the fall for it, at least a partial fall, and P2OG is real.
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:19.500]  A year before the war, Rumsfeld's saying, I mean, there's a 1983 Israeli plan to use America to invade,
[02:43:22.861 --> 02:43:24.182]  Yeah, I know.
[02:43:24.262 --> 02:43:27.243]  I'm aware of all this.
[02:43:27.343 --> 02:43:36.068]  I know that there are elements inside the Bush administration, especially Donald Rumsfeld's associates, Doug Feith, Wolfowitz and others, who long ago
[02:43:37.406 --> 02:43:44.473]  You know, cross the line of serving America, and they start serving another country out there, Israel.
[02:43:44.854 --> 02:43:53.483]  And they started putting Israeli... Well, my point is that Israel publicly had the plan to have Iraq in civil war.
[02:43:54.375 --> 02:43:56.977]  Well, from the Israeli perspective, yeah.
[02:43:56.997 --> 02:44:03.581]  This dates back to the Iran-Iraq war, where we said it's good to have the Iranians and Iraqis killing each other.
[02:44:04.061 --> 02:44:04.541]  Exactly.
[02:44:05.182 --> 02:44:07.623]  Tell us a little bit about the book, and then I want to take some calls, Scott.
[02:44:07.643 --> 02:44:09.324]  Well, again, the book sets the record straight.
[02:44:09.825 --> 02:44:11.105]  It puts down in great detail.
[02:44:11.646 --> 02:44:15.368]  I call it the Rosetta Stone for the situation in Iraq today.
[02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:19.791]  Once you understand the reality of, you know,
[02:44:21.154 --> 02:44:24.458]  What existed, who was doing what, before we went in.
[02:44:24.558 --> 02:44:26.420]  So it's all the background, all the components.
[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:29.242]  It's the alphabet to be able to read the Sanskrit.
[02:44:29.483 --> 02:44:30.223]  Absolutely.
[02:44:30.484 --> 02:44:36.910]  You read this book, and then you go back and review the speeches that people are giving today, and it'll just come right to you.
[02:44:36.930 --> 02:44:39.012]  You know it's premeditated bull.
[02:44:39.212 --> 02:44:39.553]  That's right.
[02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:42.062]  Premeditated Bull.
[02:44:42.362 --> 02:44:43.763]  And they're lying to us about this.
[02:44:43.803 --> 02:44:45.004]  What else are they lying to us about?
[02:44:45.484 --> 02:44:46.885]  Well, apparently a lot of things.
[02:44:47.066 --> 02:44:48.567]  Why did they think they'd get away with it?
[02:44:48.587 --> 02:44:52.910]  I mean, it is really... I mean, Rumsfeld gets on TV now and says, I never said there were WMDs.
[02:44:53.971 --> 02:45:00.756]  Well, what amazes me is that it takes somebody like Jon Stewart, a comedian, to point out that he's lying.
[02:45:00.897 --> 02:45:03.939]  You know, Jon Stewart will play that clip and then he goes back and plays another clip
[02:45:04.355 --> 02:45:05.915]  Why isn't CBS News doing that?
[02:45:05.955 --> 02:45:07.276]  Why isn't ABC News doing that?
[02:45:07.316 --> 02:45:08.556]  Why isn't NBC doing that?
[02:45:08.896 --> 02:45:10.156]  Showing the hypocrisy in their lives?
[02:45:10.216 --> 02:45:14.097]  Yeah, one time on Face the Nation, they just read a quote after he said it.
[02:45:14.457 --> 02:45:15.857]  And he literally turned red.
[02:45:16.318 --> 02:45:18.078]  Let's talk to Jake in Texas.
[02:45:18.118 --> 02:45:18.998]  Jake, thanks for holding.
[02:45:19.178 --> 02:45:20.278]  You're on the air with Scott Ritter.
[02:45:21.719 --> 02:45:23.039]  Hey, Alex and Scott, how's it going?
[02:45:23.839 --> 02:45:26.860]  Hey, just wanted to hear y'all's prediction.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:32.241]  Once everybody finds out the war was a fraud and everybody starts waking up to this,
[02:45:33.387 --> 02:45:34.388]  What's going to happen?
[02:45:34.448 --> 02:45:38.392]  I mean, we know they want to go after Syria and Iran.
[02:45:38.852 --> 02:45:44.977]  Well, notice the mainstream media says, even if Bush is bad and lied, we've still got to stay the course.
[02:45:45.237 --> 02:45:47.799]  We owe it to the troops to keep them in the meat grinder.
[02:45:47.839 --> 02:45:48.180]  Scott?
[02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:55.085]  Well, and that's the sad case, is that right now American troops will die for somebody's political fortune.
[02:45:55.125 --> 02:45:58.108]  But somehow it backs them up to keep them there when they're not even needed.
[02:45:58.808 --> 02:46:08.773]  And then Bush two weeks ago said, we've trained 80 groups of Iraqis, 80 groups of security forces, and then the military admits there's two groups.
[02:46:09.453 --> 02:46:11.214]  Yeah, no, it's absurd.
[02:46:11.234 --> 02:46:21.898]  When you talk about Syria and Iran, today we have John Bolton giving a speech at the United Nations where he's accusing the UN of not standing up to its obligations, da-da-da-da.
[02:46:22.299 --> 02:46:26.961]  He's setting the stage for a potential unilateral action by the United States against Syria.
[02:46:27.261 --> 02:46:27.681]  Why now?
[02:46:28.217 --> 02:46:29.157]  Syria's not a threat.
[02:46:29.578 --> 02:46:37.501]  Yeah, maybe we can be a little angry that they popped off a corrupt former prime minister of Lebanon who stole billions of dollars of the reconstruction money.
[02:46:38.421 --> 02:46:40.822]  But that's not a cause for America to go to war.
[02:46:41.362 --> 02:46:42.242]  It's a distraction.
[02:46:42.262 --> 02:46:44.623]  The Bush administration's taking it in the knee right now.
[02:46:45.804 --> 02:46:46.624]  Let me bring this up to you.
[02:46:46.664 --> 02:46:47.825]  I totally agree with you.
[02:46:48.045 --> 02:46:48.765]  It's a distraction.
[02:46:48.785 --> 02:46:49.385]  They're taking it in the knee.
[02:46:49.405 --> 02:46:50.586]  And please continue your comment.
[02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:58.991]  Ray McGovern, who I know you know personally, he said last week on this show, Bush may carry out some type of terror attack.
[02:46:59.591 --> 02:47:04.172]  Well, it wouldn't... Look, nothing this administration would do would surprise me.
[02:47:04.212 --> 02:47:05.352]  They're desperate right now.
[02:47:05.392 --> 02:47:17.574]  If you go back and take a look at the Nixon administration during the height of Watergate, there was talk of... Nixon was talking about using nuclear weapons against the Soviets in the Middle East.
[02:47:17.974 --> 02:47:19.375]  Insanity of this nature.
[02:47:20.295 --> 02:47:20.855]  When you have a
[02:47:22.093 --> 02:47:22.973]  So you think that's possible?
[02:47:22.993 --> 02:47:25.275]  You have people who have no regard for the rule of law.
[02:47:25.315 --> 02:47:27.136]  These aren't people who appreciate the Constitution.
[02:47:27.156 --> 02:47:29.837]  To them, the Constitution is an impediment.
[02:47:29.857 --> 02:47:30.458]  It's an obstacle.
[02:47:30.518 --> 02:47:31.098]  It's in the way.
[02:47:31.138 --> 02:47:32.058]  It's something to be avoided.
[02:47:52.350 --> 02:48:07.096]  And they are married to an ideology of global domination, of global imperialism, and they're not going to deviate from this... Well, every major guest I've been having on, in and out of government, has been unanimously agreeing.
[02:48:07.676 --> 02:48:10.717]  Let's jam one quick question in, and then Scott can answer it after the break.
[02:48:10.777 --> 02:48:12.638]  Clayton in Missouri, ask your question.
[02:48:13.919 --> 02:48:17.060]  Yeah, Alex, he kind of answered it indirectly.
[02:48:17.898 --> 02:48:23.361]  The United Nations came out with this report condemning Syria for a political assassination inside Lebanon.
[02:48:23.821 --> 02:48:25.542]  What a lot of people don't know is that U.S.
[02:48:25.703 --> 02:48:32.707]  forces have been in a lot of skirmishes with Syrian forces on the Iraqi border, so you'd think GW will use this U.N.
[02:48:32.747 --> 02:48:34.628]  report to invade Syria.
[02:48:35.368 --> 02:48:37.409]  We'll be right back and get Scott Ritter's comment on that.
[02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:38.110]  Great point, Clayton.
[02:48:38.130 --> 02:48:41.311]  Then we'll talk to Joe, Dave, and Richard, and that'll be it for calls.
[02:48:41.372 --> 02:48:43.653]  On the other side, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:48:47.006 --> 02:48:49.867]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[02:48:57.030 --> 02:49:01.452]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.892 --> 02:49:06.054]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.294 --> 02:49:09.135]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.235 --> 02:49:13.897]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.097 --> 02:49:18.499]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.739 --> 02:49:25.941]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:50:02.998 --> 02:50:03.278]  I think.

[02:52:18.917 --> 02:52:23.760]  For our liberty, for our freedoms, and in trying to save lives of our troops and the Iraqi people.
[02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:24.881]  Don't forget my new film.

[02:52:39.290 --> 02:52:42.812]  Scott, answering that question, they really want to go into Syria and Iran.
[02:52:42.852 --> 02:52:44.373]  I've got friends and family in the military.
[02:52:44.393 --> 02:52:45.674]  They've been told they're going into Syria.
[02:52:46.134 --> 02:52:50.238]  I see, again, this administration wants to go to Syria, wants to go to Iran.
[02:52:50.258 --> 02:52:55.562]  Iran has turned into a little bit more of a difficult proposition, both diplomatically and militarily and financially.
[02:53:13.115 --> 02:53:15.698]  So Iran may be pushed to the back burner right now.
[02:53:15.718 --> 02:53:17.900]  It doesn't mean it's going away, and we should never forget that.
[02:53:18.081 --> 02:53:22.045]  So the snake's going to try to eat a smaller... Yeah, we're going to go small first.
[02:53:22.105 --> 02:53:27.631]  In Syria, I think the feeling of the Bush administration is this is a very easy target.
[02:53:27.671 --> 02:53:34.598]  It's one that, again, would make Israel very happy if we took out this regime.
[02:53:35.586 --> 02:53:39.608]  I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as they think it's going to be.
[02:53:39.628 --> 02:53:44.350]  But if terrorists blow something up in America, hmm, then maybe.
[02:53:44.890 --> 02:53:50.133]  Well, you know, whether terrorists are planning to do it now, I can tell you one thing.
[02:53:50.173 --> 02:53:53.735]  If we go into Syria, there will be a whole host of people planning to blow it up.
[02:53:54.855 --> 02:53:56.216]  People need to understand something.
[02:53:56.696 --> 02:54:02.699]  We have an administration that has no appreciation of history, no appreciation of how the rest of the world works.
[02:54:03.735 --> 02:54:05.756]  You know, they use the language of crusade.
[02:54:06.056 --> 02:54:11.278]  We have a president who speaks of... See, I think they do know the language.
[02:54:11.298 --> 02:54:13.258]  Evangelical Christianity.
[02:54:13.338 --> 02:54:14.779]  God has told him to do this.
[02:54:15.379 --> 02:54:17.319]  And we've invaded two Muslim nations.
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:18.880]  We're getting ready to invade a third.
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:20.421]  See, Scott, that's where we differ.
[02:54:20.981 --> 02:54:24.122]  They know it's meant to enrage them.
[02:54:24.322 --> 02:54:25.442]  Let's take two quick calls.
[02:54:25.802 --> 02:54:27.283]  Joe in California, then Dave.
[02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:28.083]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:54:28.943 --> 02:54:29.764]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:54:29.964 --> 02:54:30.824]  Good morning, Scott.
[02:54:31.866 --> 02:54:34.209]  Scott, you really have a lot of good things to say.
[02:54:34.669 --> 02:54:41.919]  There's some problems out here some people have trying to impeach you as a good source of information because of some morals charges.
[02:54:41.959 --> 02:54:44.643]  I wish you could address those and tell us how that happened.
[02:54:45.344 --> 02:54:46.746]  Oh, give me some specifics.
[02:54:47.586 --> 02:54:51.428]  Look, look, anything that's been said about Scott is pure bull.
[02:54:52.349 --> 02:54:53.470]  And we're just flat out of time.
[02:54:53.490 --> 02:54:58.213]  We'll have to have him back up sometime if we want him to address just basic bull.
[02:54:58.653 --> 02:55:02.736]  I mean, everything he's said has been proven to be true, and we've had the government trying to attack Scott.
[02:55:02.756 --> 02:55:03.416]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:04.136 --> 02:55:05.377]  Let's take one final call.
[02:55:05.397 --> 02:55:07.559]  We just don't have time to get into any baloney.
[02:55:08.319 --> 02:55:09.640]  Dave in Illinois.
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:10.280]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:55:11.121 --> 02:55:11.421]  Thank you.
[02:55:12.009 --> 02:55:15.051]  And Scott, I want to say, I trust my instincts pretty good.
[02:55:15.072 --> 02:55:17.714]  When I first saw you, I thought another shill for the administration.
[02:55:18.114 --> 02:55:19.535]  But I think you're a true patriot.
[02:55:19.695 --> 02:55:20.716]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:55:20.796 --> 02:55:22.137]  Everything he said's been proven.
[02:55:22.157 --> 02:55:23.118]  People can't say that.
[02:55:23.138 --> 02:55:25.240]  Well, I don't know if I want to believe Scott Ritter.
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:28.342]  Everything he said has turned out to be pure gold.
[02:55:28.762 --> 02:55:31.745]  He's courageous enough, patriotic enough.
[02:55:31.985 --> 02:55:33.406]  Yeah, the war has been won, folks.
[02:55:33.426 --> 02:55:34.587]  We proved that we were right.
[02:55:34.607 --> 02:55:35.387]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:55:36.468 --> 02:55:40.972]  And Mark Twain said a true patriot is a rare commodity.
[02:55:41.801 --> 02:55:47.504]  And how much does Israel have to do with everything in the Middle East?
[02:55:47.924 --> 02:55:49.504]  Okay, boom, that's all we've got time for.
[02:55:50.025 --> 02:55:52.306]  Israel, again, back to Israel's role in all this.
[02:55:52.686 --> 02:55:52.966]  Scott?
[02:55:53.866 --> 02:55:57.548]  We don't want to oversimplify it, and we don't want to exaggerate it, but it's there.
[02:55:57.568 --> 02:56:04.371]  I mean, there are elements of the far-right wing of the Likud Party who have aligned themselves with these neoconservatives in the Bush administration.
[02:56:04.830 --> 02:56:08.251]  And they have a heavy influence on what we're doing in the Middle East today.
[02:56:08.431 --> 02:56:10.491]  And they have their own offices in the Pentagon.
[02:56:10.831 --> 02:56:11.972]  Apparently they do.
[02:56:12.652 --> 02:56:14.372]  And then they get to write the fake intelligence.
[02:56:15.373 --> 02:56:17.773]  All right, well, Scott Ritter, thank you for coming on, my friend.
[02:56:17.793 --> 02:56:19.354]  The new book is Iraq Confidential.
[02:56:19.374 --> 02:56:19.774]  Take care.
[02:56:20.154 --> 02:56:20.794]  Okay, thank you.
[02:56:21.094 --> 02:56:21.394]  You bet.
[02:56:21.434 --> 02:56:22.334]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.374 --> 02:56:23.095]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.295 --> 02:56:24.755]  I'll see you at the Alamo Draft House Thursday.
[02:56:24.795 --> 02:56:25.115]  Be there.
[02:56:25.615 --> 02:56:30.516]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
