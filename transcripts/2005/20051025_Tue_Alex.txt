[00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:05.997]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:07.698]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:09.559]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.661]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:17.023]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:21.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:25.587]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:29.668]  It is Tuesday, the 25th day of October 2005.
[00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:34.230]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.912]  We're going to have wide-open phones throughout the entire broadcast.
[00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:42.814]  We've had a lot of guests on lately, and I want to give you a chance to get involved on air, especially...
[00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:55.544]  First-time callers or callers who don't call on a routine basis, folks who've been unable to get through in the past, we will go to your calls in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.707]  You're welcome to talk about the revelations that Scott Ritter, the U.N.
[00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:00.969]  Weapons Inspector, brought forward yesterday on this show.
[00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:04.648]  He said, yeah, the government might carry out terror attacks.
[00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:08.431]  This administration might carry out terror attacks as a provocation.
[00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:15.555]  And, of course, the former Abu Ghraib general, Porcher, is continuing, she said, and it goes right to the top.
[00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.738]  Are we going to see indictments against top Bush officials?
[00:01:21.537 --> 00:01:23.858]  In the Bush White House, are we going to see it?
[00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.219]  There is just a whole host of news.
[00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.259]  We have the aftermath of Hurricane Wilma.
[00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.361]  There's a ton of news and information coming up after this quick break.
[00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.841]  But first, you want it, you got it.
[00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.042]  Here's Don Henley and Inside Jobs.

[00:02:44.713 --> 00:03:14.091]  This little island Disappears While you are Looking the other way They'll take your rights To own your own ideas And isn't it sad Just be the same Your trusted servants Have left you Unprotected With an
[00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:32.395]  We're good to go.
[00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:52.308]  We're good to go.
[00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:16.063]  We're good to go.
[00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:43.291]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:45.472]  Stay with us.
[00:04:45.572 --> 00:04:48.995]  Transmission will continue.
[00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:04.896]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:05.817]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:06.737]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:11.741]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:16.525]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:21.108]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:24.171]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:28.935]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:33.540]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:41.007]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:04.255]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:05.785]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:08.467]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:26.955]  Welcome to the second segment.
[00:08:27.255 --> 00:08:29.356]  Eight minutes, thirty seconds in right now.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:38.705]  On this Tuesday, 25th day of October 2005, we're going to have wide open phones.
[00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:44.168]  Robert and Steve and Janie and many others, we're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:54.514]  The toll-free number to join us on air, wide open phones today, preferably first-time callers or folks that haven't called in quite a while, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:54.614 --> 00:08:58.676]  That's because we don't screen your calls, we just ask your first name and where you're calling from.
[00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:08.783]  But I get a lot of emails and occasional phone calls that people have been trying to get in to the show for months, but obviously the phone lines are always full, and so they're unable to get through.
[00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:13.827]  So we want to give people a chance to call in who haven't had a chance or haven't been able to.
[00:09:15.108 --> 00:09:15.568]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:20.231]  Well, the Times is reporting Cheney first discovered CIA officials' names.
[00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:31.435]  And that it's Cheney who first disclosed that little tidbit.
[00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:32.196]  Well, of course.
[00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:35.158]  He is a well-known micromanager.
[00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:37.299]  Everything has run out of his office, basically.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.861]  The contracts, all of it.
[00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:53.852]  The New York Times reported late Monday that Vice President Cheney has been directly linked to the so-called Plaingate scandal involving the disclosure of the name of Valerie Plame, a CIA officer.
[00:09:54.446 --> 00:10:14.643]  The paper reported that Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis Scoober Levy, first learned about the CIA officer at the heart of the leak investigation in a conversation with Mr. Cheney weeks before her identity became public in 2003.
[00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:22.979]  The paper sourced their story to lawyers involved in the case.
[00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:33.144]  The Times said that notes taken by Libby differ from his own testimony before the grand jury as to when he first learned of Plain's identity.
[00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:37.286]  And they never get in trouble for what they've actually done.
[00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:48.232]  They always get in trouble for lying under oath or lying to federal officers or trying to abscond or frustrate a federal or state grand jury.
[00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:52.816]  Why don't these people just keep their big fat mouths shut?
[00:10:53.637 --> 00:10:55.558]  And I'm telling the public this.
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:07.708]  Keep your mouths shut, whether you're innocent, whether you're guilty, whether they're trying to frame you, whatever.
[00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.389]  That's why we have the Fifth Amendment.
[00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.651]  Do not answer any questions.
[00:11:12.692 --> 00:11:15.815]  Keep your mouth shut, and it will go nowhere.
[00:11:17.416 --> 00:11:18.537]  That's the way it works.
[00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:24.450]  But they just can never keep their mouths shut, and they flap their lips.
[00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:39.013]  And the only reason I bring this up is that so many of you out there, and most of the time when somebody gets charged with something or gets pursued by the authorities, most of the time they are completely innocent.
[00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.434]  That's the actual statistics.
[00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:46.035]  And there are a lot of people laboring in prison and in jails all over this globe that are innocent.
[00:11:46.764 --> 00:11:50.867]  But here in the United States, we still have the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[00:11:51.448 --> 00:11:54.430]  This is a good lesson of how keeping your mouth shut is a good idea.
[00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:56.432]  And that's why the Fifth Amendment is there.
[00:11:56.452 --> 00:11:58.734]  And they can tell you, I'm going to make you talk.
[00:11:58.774 --> 00:11:59.595]  You've got to talk.
[00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:00.856]  I'll hold you in contempt.
[00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:05.659]  The President and the Bill of Rights says that judge can't do that.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:13.446]  And they may try to throw you in jail or punish you or whatever they're going to do if you don't talk, but they cannot compel you to talk.
[00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:16.723]  Name, rank, and serial number.
[00:12:17.843 --> 00:12:31.567]  I know of just so many cases where people are innocent of the crimes that they have been charged with, or innocent of what they're being investigated for, but they end up going to prison for lying to authorities.
[00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:33.608]  And I don't even think that that should be a law.
[00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:34.528]  That's ridiculous.
[00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:36.709]  You lied to the God.
[00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:38.690]  You lied to your Lord.
[00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.590]  You lied to your King.
[00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.011]  But regardless, just don't talk to them.
[00:12:44.557 --> 00:12:50.078]  I mean, if I was arrested and being charged with some trumped up garbage, Alex Jones.
[00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:51.959]  Alex Jones.
[00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:53.979]  My date of birth.
[00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:55.059]  That's it.
[00:12:55.079 --> 00:13:02.201]  I mean, if they insisted on charging me, they might get not guilty.
[00:13:03.921 --> 00:13:04.361]  That's it.
[00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.921]  That's all you're ever going to get.
[00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:08.502]  Because they're only going to twist it.
[00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:12.843]  Now look, I'm not here defending Scooter Libby and
[00:13:15.325 --> 00:13:24.314]  Dick Cheney and Carl Rover, that's his real name, any of these people, I'm not here defending them.
[00:13:24.894 --> 00:13:26.075]  I can't stand them.
[00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:28.718]  But take Tom DeLay.
[00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:38.227]  I mean, they're just waiting for Tom DeLay to lie under oath or lie to authorities, officials, thought they were servants, and they're going to get him on that.
[00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.551]  And of course what Ronnie Earl is doing is political.
[00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.172]  Of course it's selective enforcement.
[00:13:44.672 --> 00:13:46.073]  Of course it's a persecution.
[00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:48.353]  And I can't stand Tom DeLay.
[00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:50.354]  He makes me want to throw up.
[00:13:50.894 --> 00:13:56.657]  But protecting people's liberties, even criminals' liberties, is more important to me than sending them to prison.
[00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:58.457]  It's that simple.
[00:13:58.957 --> 00:14:00.038]  Better that ten...
[00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:06.488]  Guilty men go free that one innocent man go to prison.
[00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:09.070]  That's what America is built on.
[00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:14.615]  Governments are more corrupt and more dangerous and more threatening than any pack of criminals.
[00:14:15.976 --> 00:14:29.908]  I'm more worried about the government getting a hand up on us, getting a leg up on us, getting above us, getting a stronghold, getting basically our collective arm behind our backs.
[00:14:31.812 --> 00:14:34.976]  We've got to defend the Bill of Rights.
[00:14:35.937 --> 00:14:38.740]  I mean, I want to see grand jury indictments on real issues.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:47.391]  They always go after Clinton for address or for lying about some affair with that Jones creature.
[00:14:49.102 --> 00:14:51.523]  Why not go after him for communist generals in the White House?
[00:14:51.603 --> 00:14:53.203]  Why not indict him for high treason?
[00:14:53.664 --> 00:15:03.247]  But see, right after he got out of office, when that could happen, George Bush protected him, making George Bush, George W. Bush, an accomplice to all of that.
[00:15:05.547 --> 00:15:06.948]  So that's really what it boils down to.
[00:15:08.411 --> 00:15:22.583]  I'd like to see him go out for Cheney and the rest of his crew for lying to Congress, bringing forth false evidence of WMDs that the Downing Street memos and other admissions clearly shows were fabricated intelligence.
[00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:25.986]  I'd like to see him go to prison for their Enron connections.
[00:15:26.586 --> 00:15:33.392]  All red-handed, smoking gun, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, but don't hold your breath because, see,
[00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:34.491]  We're good to go.
[00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:34.731]  I think?
[00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:01.599]  A million of us could nibble at it at this speed.
[00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:06.002]  It's just growing like a cancer at ten times the rate we're cutting it back.
[00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:09.244]  So I've had enough.
[00:16:09.664 --> 00:16:15.927]  And everybody's running around euphorically giggling and gibbering.
[00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:16.788]  Giggering.
[00:16:16.828 --> 00:16:17.588]  That's a new word.
[00:16:18.609 --> 00:16:21.510]  A cross between giggling and gibbering.
[00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:22.471]  Giggering.
[00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:27.614]  I was about to say giggling and gibbering, but I thought to myself, you know, I use the word...
[00:16:28.903 --> 00:16:29.924]  Gibbering too much.
[00:16:29.944 --> 00:16:30.884]  I like that word.
[00:16:31.564 --> 00:16:32.685]  I gibber myself.
[00:16:33.205 --> 00:16:34.346]  That's kind of why I use it.
[00:16:35.226 --> 00:16:40.829]  And so I was going to say giggling and gibbering, but I have invented a new word, giggering.
[00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.630]  Ha-ha!
[00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:44.752]  All right, side issue.
[00:16:45.012 --> 00:16:46.032]  A new word is born.
[00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:46.773]  I hope you'll use it.
[00:16:47.313 --> 00:16:47.813]  Giggering.
[00:16:49.114 --> 00:16:51.395]  I haven't coined many, but there's one I'm proud of.
[00:16:51.415 --> 00:16:54.497]  Of course, I did coin propaganda placement.
[00:16:54.517 --> 00:16:54.797]  You have...
[00:16:55.467 --> 00:17:00.469]  Much of the advertisement now hidden in movies and TV shows, that's called product placement.
[00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.350]  We don't do that here.
[00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.031]  We're very overt about our plugging.
[00:17:04.751 --> 00:17:09.634]  And then we also have propaganda placement.
[00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:16.157]  That's what the government covertly places and pays for, propaganda in TV shows and movies and print.
[00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:20.619]  We're going to get into, oh, that's right, CBS News.
[00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.460]  Turns out Mr. Roberts is for gun control.
[00:17:25.487 --> 00:17:29.248]  Yes, I'm afraid that wasn't mentioned to you.
[00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:32.169]  I know I'm liberal because I don't want to turn my guns in.
[00:17:32.889 --> 00:17:33.509]  I understand.
[00:17:33.569 --> 00:17:34.629]  I'm not a good neocon.
[00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:41.091]  I'm not a dirty beatnik from the 60s, a leader of the hippies like Michael Savage, so I can't be your great conservative leader.
[00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:42.051]  I understand.
[00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:46.693]  I'm not an oily pill popper like Limbaugh, so I'm bad.
[00:17:46.713 --> 00:17:50.434]  We're going to get into that, and there's just so much more.
[00:17:50.454 --> 00:17:51.634]  I mean, there's just masses of news.
[00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:55.206]  Another major Pentagon espionage scandal is brewing.
[00:17:55.246 --> 00:17:58.987]  A news article here about the Pentagon wanting to put brain chips in the troops.
[00:17:59.107 --> 00:18:00.128]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:06.430]  But right now, let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania, then Janie, and then many others.
[00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.870]  Go ahead.
[00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.671]  You're on the air, Steve.
[00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:10.832]  Alex, nice to hear you.
[00:18:11.232 --> 00:18:12.112]  Yes, nice to hear you.
[00:18:12.332 --> 00:18:16.233]  Speaking of the smoking gun, I just have a news report.
[00:18:16.754 --> 00:18:19.955]  I was going to call you in a couple days ago, but I had to go on a trip, and...
[00:18:21.203 --> 00:18:25.266]  You're going to get a chance because you're trying to call near the end of the show.
[00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:28.528]  You might be on the phone for a couple of hours.
[00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:35.153]  Anyway... I mean, that's interesting information, but it doesn't really... It's just kind of like trivia.
[00:18:35.493 --> 00:18:42.178]  Yeah, the news report is... I was talking to a gentleman I know out in the L.A.
[00:18:42.298 --> 00:18:48.523]  area, and he was driving down the road the other day, and about three...
[00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:51.587]  There was a bus in front of him about three cars ahead.
[00:18:51.607 --> 00:18:56.792]  And that bus took off off the ground about 20 feet off the ground.
[00:18:56.812 --> 00:19:00.755]  And he said he'd seen bodies flying through the windows.
[00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:05.939]  And he shook his car, lifted his car up a little bit.
[00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:10.423]  And he went down to the local news station.
[00:19:10.443 --> 00:19:11.464]  He was looking at the news.
[00:19:11.524 --> 00:19:12.225]  Nothing was happening.
[00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:12.805]  So he went down.
[00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:14.887]  There were news reporters everywhere.
[00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:21.739]  I think he went down there, talked to the guy, or called him.
[00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:22.539]  Okay.
[00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:23.200]  You know, what's up?
[00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:25.722]  With the news report.
[00:19:25.762 --> 00:19:27.503]  Yes, I understand.
[00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:33.107]  The guy was a little bit nervous, and he said, well, I don't know, they're taking care of it or whatever.
[00:19:33.888 --> 00:19:39.091]  I'm wondering how many Waco's and Ruby Ridge's can happen like that, and nobody will even know about it.
[00:19:39.552 --> 00:19:41.613]  Now, specifically, when did this happen?
[00:19:41.893 --> 00:19:43.094]  It happened last Tuesday.
[00:19:43.655 --> 00:19:44.816]  Last Tuesday, and where?
[00:19:45.496 --> 00:19:46.096]  In the L.A.
[00:19:46.397 --> 00:19:46.697]  area.
[00:19:47.529 --> 00:19:49.990]  I could get a better, I could get you a street address if you want.
[00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.051]  Yes, email it to jimsoninfowars.com.
[00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:55.011]  I really appreciate that call.
[00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:55.871]  In fact, stay there.
[00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:58.792]  I want to learn a little bit more about this on the other side.
[00:20:03.754 --> 00:20:05.934]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:05.974 --> 00:20:07.715]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:16.782]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:17.022 --> 00:20:19.644]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[00:20:19.624 --> 00:20:21.046]  's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.206 --> 00:20:28.153]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:31.376]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[00:20:31.736 --> 00:20:32.236]  We're good to go.
[00:20:32.276 --> 00:20:32.616]  I think?
[00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.119]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:10.004]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.565 --> 00:21:11.085]  That's right.
[00:21:11.385 --> 00:21:13.687]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.008 --> 00:21:21.174]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:29.402]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.862 --> 00:21:34.705]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:38.348]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.390]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.047 --> 00:22:04.529]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:08.310]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.332]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:22:12.552 --> 00:22:18.715]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:19.115 --> 00:22:27.039]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:27.439 --> 00:22:32.781]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:36.723]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:37.063 --> 00:22:38.924]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:41.145]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:46.327]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:51.930]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:59.174]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:23:00.595 --> 00:23:07.480]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:20.549]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.511]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:23:22.671 --> 00:23:23.171]  We're good to go.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.762]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:48.408]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit mangosteenmarket.com.
[00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:50.291]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:50.871]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:09.813]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.413 --> 00:24:13.415]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.085]  What if you wanted to scare the police, the FBI, the locals, to get them under your control?
[00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:36.438]  You would carry out real terror attacks all over the nation.
[00:24:36.498 --> 00:24:44.844]  TWA, Flight 800, the Queens flight a few weeks after 9-11 that blew up in front of everyone at 1,200 feet.
[00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:54.650]  Some of the bombings that have gone off at refineries and power plants and even security guards see people there planting the bombs.
[00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.551]  They shoot at them.
[00:24:56.191 --> 00:24:59.874]  The FBI then comes in and tells them to shut up, and two days later there's an explosion.
[00:25:01.889 --> 00:25:03.290]  Stuff like this is going on.
[00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:10.453]  And there are real copycat terrorist groups who don't know that it's Al-Ciata carrying out the big events.
[00:25:10.753 --> 00:25:12.974]  There are a few real Muslim terrorist groups.
[00:25:12.994 --> 00:25:20.738]  There are a few real white supremacist groups that have been carrying out smaller, uncoordinated terrorist attacks.
[00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:26.361]  And we've caught the FBI back in 1998 creating a Klan group out of nothing.
[00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:35.728]  Trying to get them to build bombs, trying to get them to bomb a chemical plant in Fort Worth, and finally the sheriff found out and busted them and shot it down before it could happen.
[00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:40.570]  And they won a Bomb Scare Award in Texas Monthly, which is a big insult for doing that.
[00:25:42.751 --> 00:25:45.412]  It's like the Stinker Award or something here in Texas.
[00:25:47.093 --> 00:25:48.333]  It's saying, you know, you're very bad.
[00:25:48.353 --> 00:25:50.934]  It's like winning the award for the worst hamburger or something.
[00:25:51.695 --> 00:25:51.855]  But...
[00:25:52.898 --> 00:25:56.981]  To make a long story short, I don't know about what the caller's talking about last Tuesday, L.A.
[00:25:57.001 --> 00:26:00.264]  A bus blowing up, I think is his description.
[00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:05.207]  But it'd be really hard to keep something like that in that media-intense city quiet.
[00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:08.590]  So I don't know if there's any validity to that.
[00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:15.475]  But I know that where they have explosions and things, they have said that things that are clearly terrorist attacks aren't.
[00:26:15.856 --> 00:26:18.518]  But then they quietly use that to tell police departments, man...
[00:26:19.597 --> 00:26:21.518]  We're really under red alert right now.
[00:26:21.558 --> 00:26:23.019]  These are probably terror attacks.
[00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:25.000]  But we've had FBI agents on.
[00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:36.666]  And they've told us that they're told to keep quiet and they're told that there have been over 100 terrorist attacks since 9-11 that they're told not to tell the public because the public couldn't handle it.
[00:26:37.827 --> 00:26:43.810]  Meanwhile, the police state is just being set up around us and the border is being left wide open.
[00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:48.033]  But going back to Steve in Pennsylvania, Steve, does that...
[00:26:49.324 --> 00:26:50.885]  Tell me just a little bit more about this.
[00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:55.409]  This was last Tuesday, and your friend saw this bus blow up, or what are you saying?
[00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.891]  Alex, can you hear me?
[00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:57.871]  Yes, you can.
[00:26:58.032 --> 00:26:58.452]  Okay.
[00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:08.321]  Yeah, he was just driving up the road, and about 90 feet in front of him was a bus, and just got blam, and up it went.
[00:27:08.601 --> 00:27:10.863]  And by blam, you mean it blew up.
[00:27:11.123 --> 00:27:16.267]  Yeah, oh, it definitely blew up, and I think he did some checking, and I think they analyzed it, and they said it was C4.
[00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:18.855]  But it wasn't on the news.
[00:27:19.295 --> 00:27:19.575]  No.
[00:27:19.756 --> 00:27:22.478]  And I said... Okay, well, who told him it was C4?
[00:27:23.118 --> 00:27:26.741]  I guess he checked around and talked to some reporters or whatever.
[00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:28.002]  But it wasn't on the news?
[00:27:28.322 --> 00:27:28.542]  No.
[00:27:28.862 --> 00:27:29.983]  And that's the funny thing about it.
[00:27:30.003 --> 00:27:32.105]  Okay, listen, thanks for the call.
[00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:35.547]  If you want to send me some information, Steve, that'd be great.
[00:27:35.647 --> 00:27:40.010]  I really have trouble with your friend's story because it's Los Angeles.
[00:27:41.171 --> 00:27:44.013]  But we did have the case of that truck member up in St.
[00:27:44.053 --> 00:27:44.854]  Louis blowing up.
[00:27:45.598 --> 00:27:46.899]  Alex, how are you?
[00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:47.459]  This is Jeannie.
[00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:48.360]  I'm in San Francisco.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.200]  It's great to be with you.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.102]  Listen, you're doing a great job.
[00:27:51.182 --> 00:27:55.084]  I listen to your show every day, you and Jeff Rents.
[00:27:55.164 --> 00:28:00.087]  One of my concerns is that I'm trying to get as many people as I can to listen to you, to listen to Rents.
[00:28:11.034 --> 00:28:33.081]  I really wake up to a lot of these things, but one thing that I'm noticing, I'm from, basically, I'm Latino, and a lot of my Latino friends, they are pretty much being, I guess you could say, conditioned by the media that's telling them that a lot of the issues you bring up, like the Minutemen issue with the border and whatnot, that it's basically just a matter of racism.
[00:28:34.281 --> 00:28:36.862]  So it's really intense, especially in the colleges.
[00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:52.019]  This whole notion that... kind of like a false ideology... Well, yeah, look, I mean, you've got the big banks, the big money, funding those universities, acting like it's some type of revolutionary fervor.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.662]  Bush, who... I mean, tell your friends this.
[00:28:54.702 --> 00:28:55.803]  Hey, you know Bush is bad.
[00:28:55.823 --> 00:28:56.844]  They'll go, of course he is.
[00:28:57.184 --> 00:28:59.587]  Well, why is he for blanket total amnesty?
[00:29:00.067 --> 00:29:12.238]  I mean, this is part of the New World Order plan to bring this country down, and it's not going to help Latino Americans to have another 30 million illegal aliens, whether they're German or Chinese or Mexican.
[00:29:12.338 --> 00:29:14.920]  I mean, it's part of the New World Order plan.
[00:29:16.161 --> 00:29:16.882]  Exactly.
[00:29:16.902 --> 00:29:18.323]  Stay there, Jeannie.
[00:29:18.343 --> 00:29:18.643]  Stay there.
[00:29:18.663 --> 00:29:21.265]  I want to talk to you more on the other side.
[00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:23.947]  I mean, this is a very important issue.
[00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:26.508]  You know, I'm going to be out of town next weekend.
[00:29:44.992 --> 00:29:46.413]  But the Klan's coming to town.
[00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:47.874]  You need to come out and protest them.
[00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:48.935]  I wish I'd be here to do it.
[00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:52.557]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.037 --> 00:29:54.638]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:58.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.283 --> 00:30:03.265]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:06.188]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:11.773]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:30:12.014 --> 00:30:13.535]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:30:13.575 --> 00:30:15.837]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:30:16.017 --> 00:30:19.501]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:20.581]  We're good to go.
[00:30:42.588 --> 00:30:45.529]  Order the book and DVD now for one low price.
[00:30:45.629 --> 00:30:47.710]  Get Bulletproof Asset Protection now.
[00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.450]  Call them 888-240-3337.
[00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.990]  That's 888-240-3337.
[00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.831]  Or go to assetprotectionteam.com.
[00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:52.391]  Tell them you heard it on GCN.
[00:31:01.847 --> 00:31:05.728]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.968 --> 00:31:11.389]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:22.032]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:22.192 --> 00:31:26.533]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.673 --> 00:31:27.514]  We're good to go.
[00:31:57.274 --> 00:31:57.354]  888-803-4438.
[00:31:57.394 --> 00:32:00.216]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.677 --> 00:32:03.218]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:04.499]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:08.081]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:08.621]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:16.066]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:20.469]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.569 --> 00:32:21.009]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:26.154]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:26.274 --> 00:32:30.978]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:32:31.198 --> 00:32:33.761]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:37.424]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Peirceau Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:41.068]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:32:41.308 --> 00:32:43.669]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:44.709]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:54.573]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[00:32:54.773 --> 00:33:00.755]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:33:02.135 --> 00:33:04.876]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:04.896 --> 00:33:08.738]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.699 --> 00:33:17.600]  Folks, it's simple.
[00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:20.822]  I'm very consistent.
[00:33:21.903 --> 00:33:25.206]  You know, my last film, I'm so proud of it.
[00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:28.588]  It's Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:33:28.608 --> 00:33:29.549]  It's a miniseries.
[00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:31.290]  It's three hours long.
[00:33:32.371 --> 00:33:36.174]  It covers 9-11, the latest police state developments, and the globalist master plan.
[00:33:36.194 --> 00:33:40.557]  The last hour is how Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove tie into the Thule story
[00:33:41.303 --> 00:33:42.484]  And the Fool Society.
[00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:47.348]  And how this satanic order is in control of our government.
[00:33:47.388 --> 00:33:48.448]  I mean, it's the facts.
[00:33:49.689 --> 00:33:54.653]  And how it's involved with Nazism, the occult, you name it.
[00:33:55.654 --> 00:33:58.776]  So, you know, my last film is exposing the Nazis.
[00:33:59.977 --> 00:34:05.862]  And then I get little threatening emails, little threatening comments, and little threatening neocon...
[00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:13.755]  You know, type other so-called patriot talk show hosts attack me because, you know, I don't sit here and bash Jews.
[00:34:14.396 --> 00:34:21.661]  And I don't sit here and say I dislike Mexicans and, you know, call them little names like Mr., you know, we've all heard it.
[00:34:24.484 --> 00:34:27.546]  And because I talk to people like they're human beings because they are.
[00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:29.467]  Okay?
[00:34:30.788 --> 00:34:32.590]  And this is all just tribalism.
[00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:36.393]  But I know full well that Mecha and La Raza
[00:34:37.313 --> 00:34:40.216]  METCHA, which stands for the Reconquista of America.
[00:34:40.716 --> 00:34:41.877]  La Raza means the race.
[00:34:41.897 --> 00:34:43.118]  They go, well, that just means the family.
[00:34:43.479 --> 00:34:44.780]  Yeah, Boulder Dash, okay?
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:45.981]  Boulder Dash.
[00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:46.762]  I've read the literature.
[00:34:47.662 --> 00:34:48.283]  Poppycock.
[00:34:49.304 --> 00:34:51.426]  It's not true.
[00:34:52.106 --> 00:34:52.607]  It's bunk.
[00:34:53.147 --> 00:34:53.748]  It's just proven.
[00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:59.444]  And when you go, and I mean, I got video of in L.A.
[00:34:59.484 --> 00:35:02.527]  and San Diego, huge pictures of white people's heads cut off.
[00:35:02.807 --> 00:35:05.370]  And we're going to kill you and go back to Europe and blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:11.817]  And here you are, it's Hispanics, who on average are about 25% Native American and 75% Spanish.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.102]  And some of them are 75% Native.
[00:35:22.282 --> 00:35:24.283]  And I've talked to some of these people.
[00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:25.544]  They don't even seem to know.
[00:35:25.564 --> 00:35:26.424]  They go, I'm Mexican.
[00:35:26.444 --> 00:35:31.847]  And I go, well, that means you're European and you're Native American.
[00:35:32.568 --> 00:35:33.688]  No, I'm a Mexican.
[00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.591]  But you know that you're a Native.
[00:35:37.611 --> 00:35:38.571]  I mean, that's no insult.
[00:35:38.891 --> 00:35:40.352]  I've got some Native American blood.
[00:35:40.392 --> 00:35:43.034]  I mean, I'm proud of that genetic complement.
[00:35:44.662 --> 00:35:53.908]  And I'll be sent letters now that I've got devil's seed in me and I'm going to hell because I've got some, what is it, Comanche and Cherokee.
[00:35:53.968 --> 00:36:02.094]  But the point is that people don't even know their past so they're doomed to even know their future or what's happening in the present.
[00:36:03.574 --> 00:36:13.401]  And so, I mean, if there are groups that call for the plan of San Diego to kill all white males above the age of 16, I mean, nobody's going to kill me and my son if
[00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:15.231]  I mean, not without a fight.
[00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:16.472]  I mean, you want to fight?
[00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:17.852]  You're saying you want to kill me?
[00:36:17.872 --> 00:36:19.252]  I mean, the New World Order.
[00:36:19.453 --> 00:36:24.814]  Henry Kissinger says he wants to kill 80% of us in official CIA documents, so I go after Henry Kissinger.
[00:36:25.714 --> 00:36:32.916]  And the Larry Conquista people say they want to kill me and my son and my father and my family.
[00:36:33.076 --> 00:36:33.917]  You're going to get a fight.
[00:36:34.697 --> 00:36:38.198]  I'm going to come out and I'm going to bullhorn you and I'm going to stand up against you.
[00:36:39.538 --> 00:36:42.379]  And I just learned yesterday the Klan's going to be in town.
[00:36:43.655 --> 00:36:49.681]  Coming up next Saturday, and I hope it doesn't turn into another race riot like what happened up in Ohio.
[00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:53.064]  And again there, you saw both sides being bad.
[00:36:53.585 --> 00:37:03.275]  You've got the Klan, who I disagree with vehemently, a Masonic organization, federally controlled in almost every case, running around wanting to start a provocation.
[00:37:03.775 --> 00:37:07.559]  And once it started, and it's on video, I've seen the video online, folks.
[00:37:08.497 --> 00:37:16.324]  The blacks, many of them, started attacking any white in sight, trying to drag reporters out of their cars, knocking their windows out.
[00:37:16.584 --> 00:37:18.185]  I mean, that's not right, folks.
[00:37:18.605 --> 00:37:31.216]  You see, most of those whites are little not-need, shaking, cowardly, afraid, guilty, gun-control advocate whites who literally... I mean, folks, let me just tell blacks something.
[00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.677]  Most whites aren't going around disliking you.
[00:37:33.738 --> 00:37:36.480]  Most whites are just these guilt-ridden...
[00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:38.449]  Worshipful.
[00:37:39.209 --> 00:37:43.371]  I mean, look at how whites just totally embrace anything that's black culture.
[00:37:43.911 --> 00:37:55.854]  And so the media ignores many of the great aspects of black culture and picks these aberrant gangster rap type and the more aberrant hip-hop type and then makes that the model for black males and black females as well as whites.
[00:37:56.034 --> 00:38:00.975]  But most whites are not skulking about thinking bad things about you, just so you know.
[00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:04.687]  But they started attacking the whites.
[00:38:04.867 --> 00:38:09.910]  And then, boy, Fox News and CNN cut from that, but people recorded it off satellite.
[00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:10.570]  It's online.
[00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.610]  There's clips of it on the web.
[00:38:12.011 --> 00:38:13.191]  I watched some of it this weekend.
[00:38:15.592 --> 00:38:18.854]  A week after it happened, it took me that long to have time to go watch some of it.
[00:38:20.094 --> 00:38:22.756]  And, you know, I'm against mobs of white people.
[00:38:23.196 --> 00:38:28.739]  Imagine mobs of white people busting out windows and dragging blacks out of cars.
[00:38:29.579 --> 00:38:31.620]  So there's two dozen white supremacists
[00:38:33.041 --> 00:38:38.604]  And there's racial tensions between the Polish community and the black community.
[00:38:39.264 --> 00:38:42.166]  And so, hell, let's just beat up all the white people.
[00:38:42.806 --> 00:38:46.828]  And it happens in Seattle, and it happens all over the place.
[00:38:48.689 --> 00:38:50.910]  And, I mean, I remember growing up in Dallas.
[00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:56.927]  Walking down the street and black guys up in a doorway.
[00:38:56.947 --> 00:39:00.569]  Hey, what are you doing, you white bleep in our neighborhood?
[00:39:01.049 --> 00:39:02.991]  And I was this type of person that was kind of crazy.
[00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:03.771]  I said, bring it on.
[00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:04.212]  Let's go.
[00:39:04.232 --> 00:39:06.433]  And it wasn't because they were black.
[00:39:06.493 --> 00:39:08.915]  It was because they wanted to fight with me.
[00:39:10.035 --> 00:39:11.536]  For them, it was because I was white.
[00:39:11.556 --> 00:39:14.178]  So, you know...
[00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:17.720]  And so we're treated like that.
[00:39:18.321 --> 00:39:23.504]  What happens is, whites are subject now to a lot of reverse racism.
[00:39:23.864 --> 00:39:30.228]  So whereas ten years ago, I didn't know any white people that disliked blacks and Hispanics just for their race.
[00:39:30.769 --> 00:39:32.050]  Now, it is rampant.
[00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:32.490]  And yes...
[00:39:33.951 --> 00:39:36.133]  Folks, let me just warn the blacks and Hispanics.
[00:39:36.633 --> 00:39:38.435]  You are in grave danger.
[00:39:39.155 --> 00:39:43.178]  Don't think the toothless clan out there is something you've got to worry about.
[00:39:43.258 --> 00:39:47.721]  The real groups you've got to worry about are massive and are growing.
[00:39:48.481 --> 00:39:59.729]  And they're feeding off of the fact that you haven't gotten your black racism and your Hispanic racism, your tribalism, in tow, in check, because you don't have any guilt.
[00:39:59.829 --> 00:40:00.890]  You're very self-righteous.
[00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.411]  A lot of you are very out of control.
[00:40:03.584 --> 00:40:05.525]  We're about to go back to Jeannie.
[00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:06.866]  She brought up just great points here.
[00:40:07.546 --> 00:40:09.207]  I was trying to preach on this subject.
[00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:18.152]  And so you have been really mean to a lot of bleeding hearts who were ready to worship you and ready to grovel at your feet.
[00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:19.973]  Now they're not ready to do that.
[00:40:20.914 --> 00:40:25.656]  And there is a massive pendulum swing, a massive backlash.
[00:40:25.696 --> 00:40:27.678]  And folks, you know I'm good at looking at trends.
[00:40:27.978 --> 00:40:30.159]  I've never talked about this, but I'm going to tell you up front.
[00:40:31.347 --> 00:40:33.188]  The New World Order knows what it's done.
[00:40:33.468 --> 00:40:40.051]  It's going to try to play us off against each other in a huge race war, and we have got to try to avert that.
[00:40:40.951 --> 00:40:41.351]  Okay?
[00:40:42.512 --> 00:40:48.154]  And if you want to run around with pictures of white people's heads cut off and say you're going to kill us all, ha ha ha, listen.
[00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:53.316]  Number one, you're going to lose, and the people fighting you are going to lose.
[00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:54.797]  We're all going to lose in a race war.
[00:40:56.244 --> 00:41:02.187]  Number two, you're being manipulated, and that goes for Ku Klux Klan members, Metro La Raza members, everybody.
[00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:05.809]  So yes, I've gone out and protested the Klan and gotten death threats from them.
[00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:06.950]  I've done it many times.
[00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.931]  And I've gone out and protested Metro La Raza crowd.
[00:41:11.092 --> 00:41:21.858]  And I would love to be down there next Saturday, but I haven't seen... I haven't been out to the family ranch in over a year, but I haven't seen family in over a year, and this is already set up, and so...
[00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:23.910]  I've said family comes first.
[00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:30.373]  In the past, I would cancel this little trip I'm going to take next weekend and go bullhorn the Klan.
[00:41:31.274 --> 00:41:35.296]  But I'm going to have some guests on about it next week, and I hope you'll go out and do it.
[00:41:36.436 --> 00:41:41.819]  But, by the way, again, it's just out of control.
[00:41:43.155 --> 00:41:44.996]  So we've got to navigate this.
[00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:52.361]  And we've got to ask ourselves, why is the Ford Foundation funding billions of dollars into the Lurica and Kista?
[00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:55.522]  It's nothing but to undermine the sovereignty of this country.
[00:41:55.983 --> 00:41:58.244]  What does Bush and his controllers openly want?
[00:41:58.524 --> 00:41:59.485]  What does Bill Clinton want?
[00:41:59.805 --> 00:42:01.146]  A pan-American union.
[00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.207]  And so this is happening.
[00:42:05.908 --> 00:42:09.351]  And it's very, very serious.
[00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:11.652]  Very, very serious.
[00:42:12.953 --> 00:42:25.635]  And instead of people living in peace together, I mean, in Texas in the past, California, there's always been some friction between whites and Hispanics.
[00:42:27.236 --> 00:42:30.856]  But in Texas, that's not really been the case compared to California.
[00:42:30.896 --> 00:42:31.837]  People have gotten along.
[00:42:32.197 --> 00:42:33.977]  The communities have lived side by side.
[00:42:34.037 --> 00:42:37.178]  And, of course, the two cultures have grown together.
[00:42:38.298 --> 00:42:39.098]  And it's been happening.
[00:42:39.821 --> 00:42:40.581]  It's not now.
[00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:41.782]  There's invasion stickers.
[00:42:41.802 --> 00:42:43.102]  They actually have stickers on their cars.
[00:42:43.482 --> 00:42:44.803]  I mean, thousands of them here in Austin.
[00:42:44.823 --> 00:42:50.185]  You want to see billboards and stickers everywhere.
[00:42:50.525 --> 00:42:51.525]  It's the invasion.
[00:42:52.185 --> 00:42:54.026]  And to, you know, speak some Spanish.
[00:42:54.066 --> 00:42:55.386]  My wife speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:42:55.887 --> 00:42:57.347]  She lived in Madrid for six years.
[00:42:58.167 --> 00:43:01.769]  And, you know, to hear the comments in the grocery stores and to hear the comments.
[00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:08.691]  You know, my cousin, Buckley Hammond, he lived, I don't know, the first five, six, seven years of his life in Guatemala.
[00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:15.758]  And I mean, so he... You know, we've been on a trip before, and he's sleeping in the bed next to me in the hotel.
[00:43:15.798 --> 00:43:22.707]  You know, he's sleeping in the twin next to me, and he's speaking in his dreams in Spanish.
[00:43:22.788 --> 00:43:22.988]  I mean...
[00:43:23.792 --> 00:43:25.613]  You know, I mean, that's really his first language.
[00:43:26.114 --> 00:43:28.655]  And, you know, he's worked as a bartender for many years.
[00:43:29.155 --> 00:43:35.199]  And he says, I mean, you know, Hispanics walk up to the table and sit there and make little mean comments about him.
[00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:37.981]  And then he'll just snap back, hey, buddy.
[00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:40.182]  He freaks them out real bad.
[00:43:40.583 --> 00:43:43.144]  He'll go, you know, I'm more Latin than you are.
[00:43:43.164 --> 00:43:44.665]  And they'll freak out and apologize.
[00:43:44.965 --> 00:43:46.686]  You know, we're sick of it.
[00:43:47.607 --> 00:43:47.987]  Okay?
[00:43:48.107 --> 00:43:49.348]  We're tired of it.
[00:43:50.542 --> 00:43:52.663]  And I'm not going to be used, though.
[00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:59.144]  I'm not going to turn to the dark side and go join the Storm Front or the National Alliance.
[00:44:00.485 --> 00:44:00.905]  Okay?
[00:44:01.685 --> 00:44:03.646]  I mean, I'm not going to just... And you know what?
[00:44:03.706 --> 00:44:11.728]  Frankly, with all this stuff, the black leader saying kill all the whites and whites are the problem, and the Mexican leader saying this, you know, I don't blame people doing that.
[00:44:12.708 --> 00:44:16.689]  But I'm telling you, it's destructive, it's bad for humanity, and it isn't going to work.
[00:44:17.296 --> 00:44:19.437]  And the bankers are playing us off against each other.
[00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:26.241]  And I don't blame Hispanics who were called names and were discriminated against going and joining Meche and La Raza.
[00:44:27.362 --> 00:44:28.222]  It feels good.
[00:44:28.262 --> 00:44:29.003]  It's tribal.
[00:44:30.063 --> 00:44:32.265]  I mean, that's how we're designed, folks.
[00:44:34.646 --> 00:44:35.226]  But I know this.
[00:44:35.286 --> 00:44:36.747]  It's better for our children.
[00:44:36.787 --> 00:44:38.468]  It's better for our society.
[00:44:38.488 --> 00:44:39.729]  It's better for us in the long run.
[00:44:40.712 --> 00:44:51.338]  If we do love our cultures, and if we do try to keep them strong, and if we don't let the globalists destroy all our cultures, whether it's Hispanic or white or black or whatever, it's all under attack by this Hollywood culture.
[00:44:52.979 --> 00:45:00.763]  And I'll add this, and then we're going to go back to your calls, because I know I've been really preaching here, that it's better for the bottom line.
[00:45:00.803 --> 00:45:02.163]  It's better financially.
[00:45:02.584 --> 00:45:03.864]  It's better with education.
[00:45:03.924 --> 00:45:05.145]  It's better environmentally.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.007]  To keep America at $315 million.
[00:45:09.428 --> 00:45:12.094]  The census five years ago said we were, what, $287 million, folks.
[00:45:12.114 --> 00:45:13.317]  We're well over $300 million now.
[00:45:17.092 --> 00:45:19.252]  And most of that growth is illegal aliens.
[00:45:19.553 --> 00:45:21.133]  And it's already hurt our economy.
[00:45:21.393 --> 00:45:22.853]  It's already lowered our standard of living.
[00:45:23.193 --> 00:45:32.835]  And I mean, if you really care about your bank account and the bottom line and your children's future, I don't care what color you are, you better join us in shutting down these borders.
[00:45:33.175 --> 00:45:36.976]  Because our mortal enemy, the New World Order bankers, are behind it.
[00:45:38.376 --> 00:45:39.397]  Now get that straight.
[00:45:40.117 --> 00:45:40.977]  And understand that.
[00:45:42.657 --> 00:45:45.978]  Because in the final equation, that's what it comes down to.
[00:45:47.225 --> 00:45:50.466]  And so, yeah, we have a lot of Hispanic listeners.
[00:45:51.607 --> 00:45:53.208]  We have a lot of Hispanic friends.
[00:45:54.128 --> 00:45:55.348]  And they know what's going on.
[00:45:55.388 --> 00:45:56.269]  They're not stupid.
[00:45:57.049 --> 00:46:00.431]  But there are these young trendies in the colleges and the rest of it.
[00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:03.872]  I mean, look at Gonzales.
[00:46:03.992 --> 00:46:04.952]  Bush is above the law.
[00:46:05.032 --> 00:46:05.813]  Torture is good.
[00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:07.113]  All this stuff.
[00:46:07.393 --> 00:46:08.574]  That's who Bush wants.
[00:46:09.274 --> 00:46:10.715]  He was a member of MEXA.
[00:46:11.935 --> 00:46:13.916]  And see, he goes to the highest pinnacles.
[00:46:14.376 --> 00:46:16.117]  The power is behind it.
[00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:21.032]  But it's only to bring in a confrontation, to break this country up.
[00:46:22.013 --> 00:46:27.618]  And some of these Mecha people think they're going to get something when America folds.
[00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:29.740]  No, it's just going to get even worse.
[00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:32.042]  There just won't be an America to run to.
[00:46:32.062 --> 00:46:34.825]  There will be a Mexico City in L.A.
[00:46:34.865 --> 00:46:36.026]  It's almost getting there now.
[00:46:38.288 --> 00:46:40.250]  And that's the plan, sinking the lifeboat.
[00:46:42.178 --> 00:46:48.419]  I mean, you know, it's not like once they break America up, suddenly they're going to go, okay, now you get the big house on the hill.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.660]  It's never going to be a racial state.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.021]  It's going to be an elite empire.
[00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:57.822]  Brzezinski openly talks about this, playing us off against each other.
[00:46:58.102 --> 00:47:01.262]  It's like Rome was about eight different sections of the city.
[00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:08.824]  The Greeks, the Jews, the Romans, the lower class Romans, the Africans, the Gauls, the Germans.
[00:47:10.091 --> 00:47:15.415]  The Persians, they had them all broken into their own little areas, and they openly played them off against each other.
[00:47:15.976 --> 00:47:16.536]  And you know what?
[00:47:16.576 --> 00:47:18.218]  We're probably not smart enough to beat this.
[00:47:18.258 --> 00:47:21.781]  We're probably not sophisticated enough to get control of ourselves.
[00:47:22.341 --> 00:47:23.642]  And so we'll probably be slaves.
[00:47:23.662 --> 00:47:24.683]  We'll all be peons.
[00:47:25.003 --> 00:47:26.044]  And then I guess it'll be fun.
[00:47:27.405 --> 00:47:32.029]  We can all live in squalor next to each other in an open sewer and all hate each other.
[00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.610]  How's that sound?
[00:47:33.192 --> 00:47:35.335]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to Jeannie.
[00:47:35.595 --> 00:47:37.898]  Jeannie, you got me preaching, but what do you think about my statements?
[00:47:38.459 --> 00:47:43.284]  I think it's true, and I think, like you said, the globalists have really strategized and devised this.
[00:47:43.645 --> 00:47:52.556]  And the thing is that I talk to a lot of people, and I'm always trying to bring this up, and I think I'm pretty good at trying to be sensitive enough and smooth enough
[00:47:52.976 --> 00:47:53.516]  Well, ask him.
[00:47:53.556 --> 00:47:58.237]  I mean, how is it different for Mecha to say that Hispanics are a cosmic god race?
[00:47:58.257 --> 00:48:00.338]  How is that different than Hitler saying that?
[00:48:00.398 --> 00:48:00.878]  I mean, ask him that.
[00:48:00.938 --> 00:48:03.458]  Well, it's like Zionism as well.
[00:48:03.498 --> 00:48:03.998]  It's the same.
[00:48:04.018 --> 00:48:04.279]  Exactly.
[00:48:21.215 --> 00:48:22.076]  Exactly.
[00:48:22.136 --> 00:48:26.180]  ...about Israel without them getting defensive because it's Israel and it has to be, you know?
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.883]  But that's the thing is, I'm trying to get people... Well, that's the deal.
[00:48:29.923 --> 00:48:31.385]  See, you just said it.
[00:48:31.725 --> 00:48:32.606]  I try to be fair.
[00:48:33.166 --> 00:48:34.528]  So I criticize Israel.
[00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:35.889]  Look, I have an AP report.
[00:48:37.131 --> 00:48:38.152]  It came out two weeks ago.
[00:48:38.172 --> 00:48:38.672]  Did you see this?
[00:48:38.692 --> 00:48:43.235]  It was also the London Guardian, where over 10,000 Chinese workers came into Israel.
[00:48:43.495 --> 00:48:48.739]  They had to sign forms saying they wouldn't talk to, wouldn't date, wouldn't touch Jewish women.
[00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:57.084]  Can you imagine if we told 10,000 Indian workers coming to the U.S., you can come into the U.S., but don't talk to white women?
[00:48:58.695 --> 00:49:03.177]  I mean, why in the world is Israel allowed to do... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:49:03.197 --> 00:49:04.658]  No, no, no, that's a good point.
[00:49:05.058 --> 00:49:16.043]  The thing is, I think the media and Hollywood is being orchestrated to specifically stick to race because it's a distraction from what they're doing behind the scenes and this whole...
[00:49:16.563 --> 00:49:19.926]  That's why I tried to go down there and protest that, and I tried to explain it.
[00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:49.491]  And, I mean, there were people wearing T-shirts for the plan of San Diego.
[00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:50.512]  It really freaked me out.
[00:49:51.392 --> 00:49:54.634]  And, again, it's primitive.
[00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:56.595]  That's why it works.
[00:49:57.255 --> 00:49:59.117]  But, listen, this debate starts now.
[00:49:59.617 --> 00:50:04.700]  And I've got to tell you, the majority of Hispanics I've talked to were like you, Jeannie.
[00:50:06.152 --> 00:50:08.874]  Most of them know what's going on and are aware of what's happening.
[00:50:09.175 --> 00:50:10.396]  In fact, I've said this on air.
[00:50:10.816 --> 00:50:19.203]  Hispanics are, per capita, the group that I've found that's the most receptive and the most, quote, conspiracy-oriented.
[00:50:19.223 --> 00:50:29.932]  And there's even been articles written about how Arabs and Latin Americans are two groups who, quote, the media makes fun of them and says, oh, they're really conspiracy-minded.
[00:50:30.532 --> 00:50:32.394]  They haven't found a conspiracy they don't love.
[00:50:32.614 --> 00:50:35.056]  Well, that's because they lived under stuff like that.
[00:50:35.669 --> 00:50:35.929]  True.
[00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:37.150]  And so they're not stupid.
[00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.953]  So we need Hispanics to not be conned by these bankers.
[00:50:41.334 --> 00:50:43.636]  And I think we're going to win the fight, Jeannie, because of folks like you.
[00:50:44.116 --> 00:50:44.556]  Definitely.
[00:50:45.217 --> 00:50:45.677]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:47.359]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:50:47.379 --> 00:50:49.581]  And you're my brother in the truth in fighting this thing.
[00:50:50.561 --> 00:50:52.763]  I mean, folks, they're really gearing up something horrible.
[00:50:53.664 --> 00:50:57.087]  And it's very scary.
[00:51:02.367 --> 00:51:09.752]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.012 --> 00:51:14.775]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.975 --> 00:51:20.619]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.879 --> 00:51:21.600]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.179 --> 00:51:52.446]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.466 --> 00:51:52.866]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.607 --> 00:52:03.208]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:07.471]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:10.473]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.553 --> 00:52:17.238]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.438 --> 00:52:20.440]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.042]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.202 --> 00:52:33.268]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:52:33.628 --> 00:52:36.030]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:53:02.816 --> 00:53:08.758]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.978 --> 00:53:11.239]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:15.760]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:18.121 --> 00:53:18.782]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.436 --> 00:53:43.280]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:06.289 --> 00:54:14.551]  All right, I said wide open funds today, and we're doing a decent job of it, but Jeannie brought up such an important subject, and we're welcome to talk about it, if you'd like to.
[00:54:14.571 --> 00:54:22.613]  I'd like to hear from the Metcha crowd, try to call in and defend their views, or about the Ku Klux Klan, you know, any of these people who are similar.
[00:54:22.913 --> 00:54:27.114]  Or Zionists, I mean, the Klan, Metcha, the Zionists, I mean...
[00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:29.672]  I've read all their literature.
[00:54:29.752 --> 00:54:30.473]  It's identical.
[00:54:30.953 --> 00:54:38.958]  Just take out Mexican or Latino or Chicano and put in white Aryan or put in holy Jew.
[00:54:40.519 --> 00:54:41.940]  All these groups say that.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.081]  Our blood is holy.
[00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:45.082]  We are the supreme race.
[00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:48.765]  And then I'm just sitting there in the middle of it trying to live my life.
[00:54:50.446 --> 00:54:51.447]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:56.410]  Before we go back to Chris and Tom and Erica and many others...
[00:54:58.248 --> 00:55:02.451]  Folks, we're going to have one more final showing of my new film, The Order of Death.
[00:55:02.931 --> 00:55:05.453]  In fact, what I showed two weeks ago was only 40 minutes long.
[00:55:05.493 --> 00:55:09.175]  This is 45 minutes long, had a lot of added information put into it.
[00:55:09.536 --> 00:55:15.440]  And then my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, cut down to an hour and 30 minutes.
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.122]  The one you saw two weeks ago was cut down to an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:55:19.442 --> 00:55:27.448]  This has been cut down even more, but had just a bunch of pictures and video clips and new information added to my totally new film, Order of Death.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.341]  It's going to be airing first.
[00:55:29.442 --> 00:55:37.430]  I'll give a speech, air that, then we'll take a question and answer, and then I'll play the hour and a half film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:43.757]  So total run time is 2 hours 15 minutes, and then we'll take a question and answer after that.
[00:55:44.558 --> 00:55:47.982]  So it's a three hour event, and it's $8 online or $8 at the door.
[00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:55.397]  It's the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar, their new beautiful theater, their nicest location.
[00:55:55.477 --> 00:55:56.179]  I've been to them all.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.783]  Big stadium seating in the big theater.
[00:55:58.903 --> 00:56:00.045]  They're going to be in the biggest theater.
[00:56:00.606 --> 00:56:02.209]  And there are still tickets available.
[00:56:02.904 --> 00:56:07.625]  You know, I've had a whole bunch of other showings in the last year, and they've always sold out by about this time.
[00:56:08.085 --> 00:56:13.367]  But as of last night, there were still a lot of tickets left, though there probably won't be by tomorrow or Thursday.
[00:56:13.427 --> 00:56:15.227]  So take advantage of it.
[00:56:15.367 --> 00:56:26.890]  Go to infowars.com or presentplanet.com, and it links directly over to the area of the Alamo Draft House shopping cart.
[00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:30.213]  Or ticket counter where you can buy the tickets online.
[00:56:30.573 --> 00:56:39.181]  Or if you're driving down South Lamar, pull in, get tickets, bring your neighbor, bring your pastor, bring your rabbi, bring whatever to it.
[00:56:39.802 --> 00:56:45.467]  Come to this event, and I'll be there with the books and videos and all the materials and look forward to shaking your hand.
[00:56:45.827 --> 00:56:49.370]  That's Thursday night, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:50.391]  Remember the Alamo.
[00:56:51.132 --> 00:56:51.953]  Seven o'clock.
[00:56:52.777 --> 00:57:01.320]  And so please come out to the event, and for those that keep trying to get tickets but it's always sold out, now is your chance, I hope, to see you there.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:06.881]  And if you want hard copies of any of these films, you can also get them off the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:07.221 --> 00:57:09.922]  Let's talk to Chris and Mass, and then Tom and Erica and others.
[00:57:10.522 --> 00:57:11.182]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:57:12.063 --> 00:57:19.825]  Yeah, I wanted to talk to you because a friend of mine is actually very close to Hillary and her family, and I wanted to...
[00:57:20.546 --> 00:57:25.490]  Get some sort of information from you to let them know what she's really up to.
[00:57:26.971 --> 00:57:28.933]  Well, I mean, Hillary's for the war.
[00:57:28.993 --> 00:57:30.394]  Hillary's for open borders.
[00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:37.220]  Hillary is a... She meets, in the New York Observer reported, every week for four-hour dinners with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.722]  Bill Clinton's literally in business with the Bushes.
[00:57:40.303 --> 00:57:41.464]  I mean, they're CIA.
[00:57:41.484 --> 00:57:42.624]  They've always been CIA.
[00:57:42.825 --> 00:57:45.047]  They're British intel on top of that.
[00:57:45.827 --> 00:57:47.509]  And it's just totally staged and...
[00:57:49.072 --> 00:57:57.936]  And I mean, there's nothing more I can say about it, but a lot of people are awestruck being around famous people, so they'll make excuses, but it doesn't really matter.
[00:57:57.976 --> 00:57:59.477]  Hillary's just a puppet to begin with.
[00:57:59.497 --> 00:58:02.118]  All right, I don't know what I can say.
[00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:05.340]  So they just think Hillary is the Lord?
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.141]  I don't know.
[00:58:07.161 --> 00:58:08.641]  They're just, you know, pals.
[00:58:11.102 --> 00:58:12.323]  They're pals.
[00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:15.765]  Your phone's cutting out, my friend.
[00:58:15.785 --> 00:58:18.486]  All right, well, yeah, they're quite close.
[00:58:21.323 --> 00:58:24.906]  Well, uh, I mean, what do you think she should say to him?
[00:58:27.448 --> 00:58:31.390]  I try to, like, because I explain, like, the whole, like, the big picture.
[00:58:32.151 --> 00:58:33.912]  You know, people don't want to even hear that.
[00:58:34.232 --> 00:58:34.733]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:34.753 --> 00:58:36.054]  I think you're on a cordless phone.
[00:58:36.094 --> 00:58:37.475]  Get closer to your jack.
[00:58:37.915 --> 00:58:39.716]  We'll come back in one minute and you can finish up.
[00:58:41.157 --> 00:58:46.061]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.848 --> 00:58:58.468]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.149 --> 00:59:00.189]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:02.031]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.691 --> 00:59:03.491]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.252 --> 00:59:05.212]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.813 --> 00:59:09.795]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.995 --> 00:59:14.138]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.598 --> 00:59:20.161]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:23.909 --> 00:59:26.853]  We are now into our number two.
[00:59:26.873 --> 00:59:28.435]  Already a lot of great calls.
[00:59:29.416 --> 00:59:31.398]  We're going to be going to Tom and Erica here in a moment.
[00:59:31.418 --> 00:59:35.884]  We're taking mainly first-time calls today, or folks that have trouble getting through on a regular basis.
[00:59:37.062 --> 00:59:40.245]  You know, people who call a couple times a year, that's who I'm really pushing for today.
[00:59:40.265 --> 00:59:40.706]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:40.726 --> 00:59:40.826]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:41.026 --> 00:59:44.890]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:47.133]  A lot of powerful news up there today.
[00:59:47.513 --> 00:59:48.234]  Be sure and check it out.
[00:59:56.081 --> 01:00:09.907]  But going back to Chris in mass, he was talking about a friend of his that's close friends or very close to Lord Clinton, Hillary Clinton, the new darling for the presidency, was kind of Arnold, but we've kind of knocked him back down into his rat hole for now.
[01:00:10.348 --> 01:00:12.309]  He's still pushing, though, still creeping about.
[01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:13.909]  They were testing the water.
[01:00:13.929 --> 01:00:17.511]  They were trial ballooning like they were with Gonzalez for the Supreme Court.
[01:00:19.335 --> 01:00:22.757]  And then suddenly, oh, the conservatives, they'll say, we better vote for a Republican.
[01:00:23.237 --> 01:00:24.377]  Anything's better than Hillary.
[01:00:24.738 --> 01:00:26.258]  It won't matter who they put in.
[01:00:26.299 --> 01:00:27.459]  It's going to be bad either way.
[01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:33.242]  So I'm not too concerned with nothing but a mid-level puppet like Hillary Clinton.
[01:00:33.903 --> 01:00:35.864]  But go ahead and finish up your point, Chris.
[01:00:36.504 --> 01:00:37.024]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:00:37.064 --> 01:00:42.207]  I'd just like to get to Alex Jones status up here on the East Coast so I can wake as many people up.
[01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:45.949]  But the fact that I know someone so close to that kind of makes me crazy.
[01:00:45.969 --> 01:00:46.990]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:00:47.455 --> 01:00:57.942]  That, like, I'm that close to, you know, like, not the power or anything, but, like, the connections of all of that garbage, like the evil.
[01:00:57.962 --> 01:00:59.663]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:00:59.703 --> 01:01:15.073]  So I just don't know how to get people to start, you know, waking up on... Well, you know, the way you do it is not by attacking the individual personality, but by going, wait a minute, Hillary and the Democrats, where are they different from Bush?
[01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:18.812]  I have a few examples of abortion.
[01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:21.132]  That's about it.
[01:01:21.172 --> 01:01:22.792]  A few hot-button issues like that.
[01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:31.414]  But when it's down to core issues like open borders and big government and war in Iraq, there is no difference.
[01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.114]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:32.795 --> 01:01:34.575]  Let's talk to Tom in San Francisco.
[01:01:34.635 --> 01:01:35.315]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:37.115]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:37.135 --> 01:01:37.916]  What's going on?
[01:01:38.516 --> 01:01:41.316]  The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.
[01:01:41.336 --> 01:01:44.337]  Yeah, it's starting to get a little cold now, but not too bad.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:45.841]  What's on your mind?
[01:01:46.901 --> 01:01:53.825]  What's on my mind is the mad choreographer, Mr. Thomas Barnett, who's going to be on C-SPAN this weekend.
[01:01:53.845 --> 01:01:55.226]  I don't know if you saw anything about that.
[01:01:56.067 --> 01:02:03.811]  No, I mean, I saw him a couple years ago where he openly said, world government's taking over, the Pentagon works for Wall Street, we're going to enslave you, ha ha ha.
[01:02:03.831 --> 01:02:06.393]  Well, he's got a follow-up book now called Blueprint for Action.
[01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:15.427]  So, you know, I think a lot of people out there are starting to, you know, a lot of people are getting this false sense of, oh, we're bogged down in Iraq, they're not going to go attack Syria, they're not going to attack Iran.
[01:02:15.447 --> 01:02:17.289]  You know, people want to watch this stuff.
[01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.710]  Oh, really?
[01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:18.871]  They're openly at the U.N.?
[01:02:18.891 --> 01:02:19.692]  No, well...
[01:02:20.273 --> 01:02:20.753]  Well, go on.
[01:02:20.773 --> 01:02:21.073]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:21.394 --> 01:02:21.654]  No, no.
[01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:22.654]  I was just going to say you're right.
[01:02:22.674 --> 01:02:23.795]  They're openly at the U.N.
[01:02:24.255 --> 01:02:26.076]  calling for a move against Syria right now.
[01:02:26.256 --> 01:02:33.079]  Yeah, I'm just saying that people, like the public, are starting to think that, oh, we've got Bush now, so that everything is going to calm down and go back to normal.
[01:02:33.099 --> 01:02:36.701]  Yeah, wait until Bush sets a city ablaze with a stone burner.
[01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:46.585]  Yeah, so I think that he's going to be actually interviewed by Representative Feeney from Florida, and it's going to be on Sunday at 6 and 9 p.m.
[01:02:46.646 --> 01:02:47.486]  Eastern.
[01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:54.584]  Well, do you know what happened when I had him set up for the show?
[01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.765]  Yeah, he backed out on you, right?
[01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:56.005]  Didn't he?
[01:02:56.126 --> 01:02:56.606]  We're gonna win.
[01:02:56.646 --> 01:02:57.787]  We're taking over.
[01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:59.528]  I mean, literally, it was like talking to a demon.
[01:02:59.548 --> 01:03:01.050]  And I said, America will defeat you.
[01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.491]  We will stand against you.
[01:03:02.531 --> 01:03:02.811]  Keep dreamin'.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.202]  Yeah, he's a character.
[01:03:23.462 --> 01:03:26.103]  He's the spider, as you would say.
[01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:30.886]  He, man, that guy is just... Did you watch his first C-SPAN?
[01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:31.886]  Oh, yeah, I saw that.
[01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:33.627]  Do you want to comment on that when we get back?
[01:03:34.048 --> 01:03:34.268]  Sure.
[01:03:34.408 --> 01:03:36.649]  I'll let you finish up, Tom, because I keep cutting callers short.
[01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:37.870]  And Erica, Erica, stay there.
[01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:37.950]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:38.670]  Bunch of news coming up.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.642]  No, I mean, that's the thing.
[01:03:45.682 --> 01:03:47.726]  They just get up on TV and the world government's here.
[01:03:47.746 --> 01:03:48.908]  We're going to enslave you.
[01:03:48.968 --> 01:03:52.394]  Ha ha ha.
[01:03:54.545 --> 01:03:57.406]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.666 --> 01:03:59.247]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.587 --> 01:04:04.269]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:09.031]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:13.653]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.853 --> 01:04:16.674]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.794 --> 01:04:21.436]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.636 --> 01:04:22.076]  We're good to go.
[01:04:22.096 --> 01:04:22.476]  We're good to go.

[01:05:04.762 --> 01:05:12.368]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:15.770]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[01:06:09.321 --> 01:06:10.541]  We've all had enough of those.
[01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:13.503]  I'm talking about God's pure whole foods.

[01:06:48.391 --> 01:06:48.531]  224-7416.
[01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:52.454]  That's 888-224-7416.
[01:06:54.156 --> 01:06:56.357]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.918 --> 01:06:59.780]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.202 --> 01:07:02.682]  All right.
[01:07:03.783 --> 01:07:11.309]  I have been notified that Lord Barnett, Professor Barnett of the Naval War College, will be on C-SPAN coming up this weekend.
[01:07:11.369 --> 01:07:15.813]  And literally, his book, I've read it, it's written in it,
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.781]  About a seven-year-old level.
[01:07:18.282 --> 01:07:19.422]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[01:07:20.143 --> 01:07:21.024]  It's basically this.
[01:07:21.264 --> 01:07:22.585]  We are the power.
[01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:24.326]  World government is good.
[01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:27.108]  We will invade 60-plus countries.
[01:07:28.229 --> 01:07:29.630]  It's basically the PNAC plan.
[01:07:30.351 --> 01:07:31.772]  China is our friend.
[01:07:31.832 --> 01:07:33.153]  Give them all the weapons.
[01:07:33.173 --> 01:07:35.735]  Remember we had General Parton on to discredit this guy.
[01:07:36.475 --> 01:07:38.196]  And he wouldn't come on and debate Parton.
[01:07:38.737 --> 01:07:40.538]  He wouldn't come on and debate me.
[01:07:40.578 --> 01:07:41.539]  He would just cuss at me.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.360]  That's all he could do.
[01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:45.502]  And literally, you watch him
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:55.384]  But I'll never forget, he did this presentation, this PowerPoint, even with these video game noises, like dun-dun, whenever he hit a button.
[01:07:56.904 --> 01:07:58.165]  He calls it the gap.
[01:07:58.245 --> 01:08:06.849]  And basically everything but the U.S., Western Europe, Russia, and China, everything else, including all these allies, are evil.
[01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:09.410]  And they've all got to be invaded.
[01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.891]  But China's good, and so is North Korea.
[01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:13.972]  They're just threatening to get us.
[01:08:15.574 --> 01:08:17.275]  It's total New World Order politics.
[01:08:17.315 --> 01:08:19.176]  You see, China is the model, folks.
[01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:20.396]  They're near and dear.
[01:08:20.476 --> 01:08:22.377]  They have mobile execution vans.
[01:08:22.397 --> 01:08:23.997]  They kill you for your speech.
[01:08:24.097 --> 01:08:25.138]  Oh, we must love them.
[01:08:25.178 --> 01:08:26.898]  We must properly worship them.
[01:08:27.259 --> 01:08:30.200]  And he openly says Wall Street runs the military.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.601]  The military no longer works for the American people.
[01:08:32.961 --> 01:08:35.042]  We work for a global financial system.
[01:08:35.822 --> 01:08:37.302]  And it is one world government.
[01:08:37.342 --> 01:08:38.183]  It is globalism.
[01:08:38.263 --> 01:08:39.003]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:41.444]  And it is so sick.
[01:08:42.228 --> 01:08:43.449]  And I just wanted to have him on.
[01:08:43.489 --> 01:08:44.190]  I was very nice.
[01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:45.211]  I was like, please, sir.
[01:08:45.591 --> 01:08:47.312]  After we said it, he goes, I know who you are.
[01:08:47.533 --> 01:08:48.453]  You're pathetic.
[01:08:48.553 --> 01:08:52.297]  I can't believe all these congressmen and people come on your show.
[01:08:52.717 --> 01:08:55.900]  This is during a three-minute break when he was refusing to come on.
[01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:59.383]  So I called him up during the break.
[01:08:59.443 --> 01:09:00.463]  I said, please, sir, come on.
[01:09:00.864 --> 01:09:02.305]  He's like, bleeper never.
[01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:04.447]  And he's like, we're going to win.
[01:09:05.564 --> 01:09:06.185]  Who's going to win?
[01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.946]  I go, America will defeat you, sir.
[01:09:07.986 --> 01:09:11.168]  And he goes, actually, imagine, America will defeat you.
[01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:11.969]  I'll never forget this.
[01:09:12.429 --> 01:09:13.370]  We wrote an article about it.
[01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:15.031]  You know, we will stand firm.
[01:09:15.191 --> 01:09:16.452]  We will defend this nation.
[01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.574]  Just people are dreaming.
[01:09:18.974 --> 01:09:19.534]  Bleeper.
[01:09:19.915 --> 01:09:20.275]  Click.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.400]  Imagine!
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.521]  I mean, I'm talking to the guy who's creating a lot of the policy at the Pentagon.
[01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.662]  Hey, America's going to win.
[01:09:27.702 --> 01:09:28.942]  America's going to be sovereign.
[01:09:29.222 --> 01:09:30.383]  We're going to defeat you or something like that.
[01:09:30.403 --> 01:09:31.123]  That's what I said to him.
[01:09:31.143 --> 01:09:33.624]  He says, yeah, keep on dreaming.
[01:09:33.684 --> 01:09:35.425]  I mean, he actually had it in his voice.
[01:09:35.465 --> 01:09:36.665]  Just keep on dreaming.
[01:09:37.025 --> 01:09:37.865]  Like a snake.
[01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.406]  He was so angry.
[01:09:40.606 --> 01:09:41.807]  And pathetic.
[01:09:42.267 --> 01:09:45.428]  I don't want to give him much more attention, but there's a whole gaggle of him.
[01:09:47.106 --> 01:09:49.528]  But the scary part was there were all these generals and colonels.
[01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.329]  A packed conference room.
[01:09:51.469 --> 01:09:52.469]  You know, stadium seating.
[01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:56.031]  And they're all just smiling and clapping.
[01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:57.532]  Oh, yes.
[01:09:58.533 --> 01:09:59.533]  Oh, oh.
[01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:01.654]  We're going to attack all these people.
[01:10:02.455 --> 01:10:03.395]  Oh, yes.
[01:10:03.435 --> 01:10:04.936]  And we're so powerful.
[01:10:05.477 --> 01:10:07.918]  And again, we'll be the bad cop in all of it.
[01:10:08.706 --> 01:10:20.609]  With endless terror attacks to stimulate the police state at home, to clamp down on the public so we can't resist the government using us as cannon fodder to take over the world or the financial interests that sit in Europe.
[01:10:21.029 --> 01:10:22.289]  Then they play the part of the good cop.
[01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:27.110]  But finish up what you were saying there, Tom, and we'll go to Erica and others.
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.831]  Yes, in line with what you were just saying.
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.131]  About the way he talks and everything.
[01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:45.619]  I think, you know, in the debate format, I'd like to see that because I think he, you know, people, you catch him off guard, but when he has a chance to talk openly with, you know, no interruptions like that presentation, he just, because I have to admit that I, you know, I was laying there just watching it and
[01:10:46.187 --> 01:10:50.509]  After a while, he expresses so much confidence and so much, like, you know, we're going to do this, this, and this.
[01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:52.189]  He's calm and friendly.
[01:10:52.429 --> 01:10:54.310]  Oh, global government, sure.
[01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.591]  And you were saying how he puts all that sound effects and stuff.
[01:10:56.611 --> 01:10:59.732]  Like, he's the classic example of, like, the hypnotic kind of mind control.
[01:10:59.752 --> 01:11:04.774]  Like, because I started at one point, like, thinking, like, you know, going back in that TV mode of...
[01:11:05.256 --> 01:11:06.176]  Oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:11:06.196 --> 01:11:06.596]  That makes sense.
[01:11:06.656 --> 01:11:07.897]  And I was like, wait, what am I thinking?
[01:11:08.237 --> 01:11:09.557]  This guy's crazy.
[01:11:09.837 --> 01:11:12.978]  You know, it's funny you said that, because few people have that effect on me.
[01:11:13.358 --> 01:11:16.778]  But one night at about 2 a.m., I'd only read the transcript.
[01:11:16.798 --> 01:11:18.239]  I knew it was coming on about a year ago.
[01:11:18.759 --> 01:11:21.279]  So I sat up and I watched him, and I was taping it.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.540]  It was like, what, two hours long or something.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:28.761]  And after about an hour and a half, I was kind of going, oh, a friendly fella.
[01:11:28.841 --> 01:11:31.782]  And that's the thing about TV, is that it does mesmerize.
[01:11:32.222 --> 01:11:33.122]  But then imagine...
[01:11:33.835 --> 01:11:36.036]  I then tell my wife, who's my producer, hey, I want him on.
[01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:36.676]  We shut him up.
[01:11:37.237 --> 01:11:39.418]  He refuses to come on when he finds out who I am.
[01:11:39.818 --> 01:11:43.339]  I call him, and he's like a... I mean, literally like a demon.
[01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:46.521]  He even wrote a blog admitting that he'd been like that to me.
[01:11:47.321 --> 01:11:52.883]  I mean, just literally like some Rasputin Grimer worm tree.
[01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:54.964]  I appreciate the call.
[01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.165]  Yeah, it's just sick.
[01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:05.586]  He openly says on national TV that our government works for Wall Street and that the military works for Wall Street.
[01:12:06.767 --> 01:12:11.930]  You ever seen the speech they give Howard Beale in the movie, the Academy Award winning movie, Network?
[01:12:12.831 --> 01:12:22.518]  When they call Howard Beale in, who's been griping about how the big banks are controlling the news, he calls Howard Beale and he's at the number one rated show and he goes, Howard, let me tell you the facts of life.
[01:12:22.878 --> 01:12:24.299]  We've got to get that recorded.
[01:12:24.859 --> 01:12:26.801]  We've got to get that and...
[01:12:28.268 --> 01:12:33.212]  Play that little five-minute or two-minute, about three minutes long, piece.
[01:12:33.653 --> 01:12:34.814]  There's my brain nailing it down.
[01:12:34.874 --> 01:12:35.615]  Five-minute, two-minute.
[01:12:35.655 --> 01:12:36.395]  No, it's about a three-minute.
[01:12:36.696 --> 01:12:45.443]  About a three-minute little rant where he lays out how it's a global government and America isn't America anymore and we're all just cogs in this machine.
[01:12:45.743 --> 01:12:48.906]  I mean, that's like a CFR movie, folks.
[01:12:49.567 --> 01:12:51.348]  Because that's what they actually write and say.
[01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:54.952]  That's why I'm so freaked out.
[01:12:55.012 --> 01:12:55.232]  I mean...
[01:12:55.990 --> 01:13:05.476]  They're openly announcing they're going to take everything we've got away from us, break America up into pieces, totally destroy us, and we're supposed to sit here and take it.
[01:13:06.436 --> 01:13:07.977]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and take it.
[01:13:08.777 --> 01:13:10.418]  Let's talk to Erica in Oklahoma.
[01:13:10.478 --> 01:13:11.299]  Erica, go ahead.
[01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.279]  Hi, Alex.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:12.900]  Hi.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.501]  I'm a little bit nervous.
[01:13:14.561 --> 01:13:15.621]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:13:16.062 --> 01:13:17.402]  Well, don't be nervous, my dear.
[01:13:17.462 --> 01:13:17.843]  Welcome.
[01:13:18.443 --> 01:13:18.703]  Thanks.
[01:13:19.724 --> 01:13:22.585]  Well, my husband and I have been listening since, like, spring, but...
[01:13:24.011 --> 01:13:31.415]  My husband might have been listening a little bit sooner than that, but we really enjoy your show and the information and everything that you've been waking us up to.
[01:13:32.436 --> 01:13:43.001]  And I wanted to let you know my husband is in training to be a cop, but this is so that he can be on the inside and be more like a constitutional following cop.
[01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:45.663]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:13:45.683 --> 01:13:47.444]  We need good people to serve.
[01:13:48.284 --> 01:13:50.745]  And service, folks, is not a bad thing.
[01:13:50.845 --> 01:13:51.726]  It's the highest...
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.944]  Highest level in human development is to be a servant, and I really want to commend your husband.
[01:13:58.665 --> 01:13:58.925]  Good.
[01:13:59.726 --> 01:14:06.211]  Yeah, he's like wanting to keep, you know how the saying is, you want to keep your friends close, but your enemies closer kind of thing.
[01:14:06.271 --> 01:14:08.652]  Well, that should be easier in Oklahoma.
[01:14:09.213 --> 01:14:11.214]  Oklahoma's still pretty conservative.
[01:14:11.455 --> 01:14:12.636]  We live in a small town.
[01:14:13.676 --> 01:14:16.018]  O'Keen is not a very big town.
[01:14:16.038 --> 01:14:19.581]  I like to be able to, you know, I can take a nice little walk over to the grocery store and
[01:14:20.191 --> 01:14:26.275]  In the library with my kids, a couple kids, and it's like a half a mile round trip, so.
[01:14:26.675 --> 01:14:27.656]  Sounds like heaven.
[01:14:27.876 --> 01:14:29.057]  We've got a nice little town here.
[01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:47.209]  We moved from Michigan, but really enjoy it down here, and been able to hear your show, and so wanted to tell you about that, but we just got some of your films, got four of them, and taping them as we speak, actually, to send to family and
[01:14:47.913 --> 01:14:49.054]  And other people and stuff.
[01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:56.700]  Well, Erica, the power of individuals like you and your husband making copies of those videos is unbelievable.
[01:14:56.761 --> 01:14:57.361]  So thank you.
[01:14:58.742 --> 01:15:13.935]  Yeah, I thought about just this week, I was thinking about the biblical thing of the watchman on the wall, and if he sees the trouble coming and he doesn't warn the people, then trouble comes and they get hurt or killed or anything.
[01:15:14.515 --> 01:15:16.197]  Their blood's going to be on your head.
[01:15:16.772 --> 01:15:19.073]  The watchman's head for not warning the people.
[01:15:19.433 --> 01:15:32.297]  Well, I forget the actual verse, but over and over again in the Bible it says that God has set watchmen on the wall who are continually crying, who are continually warning.
[01:15:33.277 --> 01:15:34.317]  And that's us, folks.
[01:15:34.377 --> 01:15:36.438]  I mean, we've got a government.
[01:15:37.037 --> 01:15:39.878]  That does evil things I can't even mention.
[01:15:40.178 --> 01:15:42.919]  And they're trying to sell us that evil is good.
[01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:44.479]  They're trying to tell us torture is good.
[01:15:44.499 --> 01:15:47.800]  They're trying to tell us that butchering the Bill of Rights is good.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:51.401]  They're trying to tell us that all of this evil is good, and it's not good.
[01:15:51.461 --> 01:15:52.082]  It's death.
[01:15:52.642 --> 01:15:55.783]  The wages of sin are death, folks, and that means here in this life.
[01:15:56.543 --> 01:15:59.804]  You know, you do bad things, it comes back on you.
[01:16:00.564 --> 01:16:00.844]  Yeah.
[01:16:01.345 --> 01:16:06.006]  And Dan, about with, like, torture and everything, all these things on TV are just, you know, subtle...
[01:16:06.496 --> 01:16:13.840]  Totally telling us all these different things about torture and how that might be a good thing and it's necessary.
[01:16:14.721 --> 01:16:23.025]  I just saw on TV yesterday a preview for the show Commander in Chief about the lady president that's on ABC.
[01:16:24.066 --> 01:16:25.867]  But I saw a preview about it.
[01:16:25.887 --> 01:16:27.107]  I don't watch the show.
[01:16:27.948 --> 01:16:33.791]  So in the show they have it where there's going to be a terror attack, a threat or something.
[01:16:34.438 --> 01:16:36.419]  And they got somebody in custody.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.742]  So this lady president, it's her decision what to do with this person.
[01:16:40.882 --> 01:16:42.823]  And if they torture her, it'll save lives.
[01:16:43.084 --> 01:16:50.468]  Yeah, now it says that she's with her advisor, and she says she doesn't want to hear that this person was tortured.
[01:16:51.209 --> 01:16:54.971]  And her advisor person says, well, would you rather wait until the bomb goes off?
[01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.858]  So I don't watch the show.
[01:16:57.878 --> 01:16:58.178]  I don't know.
[01:16:58.199 --> 01:17:02.025]  I might watch it tonight, but... But see, that's the same situational ethics.
[01:17:02.065 --> 01:17:07.494]  The reason I knew what they would say is that was first in law enforcement publications about five years ago.
[01:17:07.514 --> 01:17:07.635]  Mm-hmm.
[01:17:08.363 --> 01:17:16.425]  And they constantly beat that drum, and it's hypothetical, you know, it's a fraud, and it's just total training for all of this.
[01:17:16.525 --> 01:17:18.825]  Again, they're trying to give us their values.
[01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:22.766]  Thanks for the call, and I'm glad you're on board with us in the fight for humanity.
[01:17:23.226 --> 01:17:24.046]  Joe in Mass.
[01:17:24.086 --> 01:17:24.787]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:17:25.167 --> 01:17:25.647]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:25.687 --> 01:17:26.407]  How are you doing today?
[01:17:26.827 --> 01:17:27.067]  Good.
[01:17:27.347 --> 01:17:28.567]  I have something I want to bring up.
[01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:30.148]  It just happened to a friend of mine.
[01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.548]  I don't know whether this is a result of the change in the government.
[01:17:33.208 --> 01:17:35.489]  He went in the hospital for surgery yesterday,
[01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:38.361]  He's on low income, as you know, Medicare, Medicaid.
[01:17:39.202 --> 01:17:40.722]  And he couldn't walk.
[01:17:40.762 --> 01:17:42.762]  They said it was his disc and they wouldn't do anything.
[01:17:42.782 --> 01:17:44.643]  But then they said there's arteries that are clogged.
[01:17:45.303 --> 01:17:46.703]  So they took him in the hospital.
[01:17:46.723 --> 01:17:47.963]  They said he would walk better than ever.
[01:17:48.443 --> 01:17:57.465]  After his surgery, they transferred him to a rehabilitation nursing home and Medicaid dropped his service so he can't get therapy.
[01:17:58.185 --> 01:18:01.946]  And his landlord kicked him out of his house against his will because she didn't like him.
[01:18:02.346 --> 01:18:03.506]  And now he's stuck in there.
[01:18:03.626 --> 01:18:04.206]  And I just wanted to
[01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:06.871]  I hope there's something that we can do to help him.
[01:18:06.931 --> 01:18:09.213]  I know I'm trying, but he needs all the help he can get.
[01:18:09.253 --> 01:18:10.034]  He's in New Jersey.
[01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:12.516]  He doesn't like being in one of those places.
[01:18:13.577 --> 01:18:15.799]  Well, sir, there's millions of people stuck in this.
[01:18:15.819 --> 01:18:17.640]  Yeah, the number one thing is family.
[01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:24.145]  They broke the family up, and so now there are millions of people.
[01:18:25.266 --> 01:18:27.088]  That's why we're supposed to have big families.
[01:18:27.628 --> 01:18:29.570]  That's why you're supposed to have four or five kids.
[01:18:30.288 --> 01:18:32.970]  So they can take care of you, and so they can take care of each other.
[01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:34.491]  I'm going to say it.
[01:18:34.511 --> 01:18:41.656]  It's very mean, I think, to only have one child, unless that's all you're given, because then they're all alone when you're dead.
[01:18:42.777 --> 01:18:49.222]  Or if you only have one child, you had better make sure that they've got connections with their cousins and other family.
[01:18:49.622 --> 01:18:50.023]  Stay there.
[01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:50.943]  We'll talk about this.
[01:18:51.003 --> 01:18:52.264]  Now I'm going to preach about family.
[01:18:52.284 --> 01:18:53.165]  Be right back.
[01:18:54.255 --> 01:18:56.758]  Genesis Radio is proud to bring you the solution.
[01:19:09.775 --> 01:19:10.935]  The Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:19:11.255 --> 01:19:12.256]  It's different from the U.S.
[01:19:12.276 --> 01:19:12.616]  dollar.
[01:19:12.676 --> 01:19:17.237]  It's 100% inflation proof because it's 100% backed by real silver.
[01:19:17.637 --> 01:19:20.277]  It's already the second most popular currency in the U.S.
[01:19:20.478 --> 01:19:24.198]  with 100,000 people using it to protect their purchasing power.
[01:19:24.578 --> 01:19:32.400]  G. Edward Griffin, the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, endorses and urges all Americans to get Silver Liberty Dollars and beat inflation today.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.221]  Don't stand by and watch your hard-earned money lose value.
[01:19:35.421 --> 01:19:36.022]  We're good to go.
[01:19:55.672 --> 01:19:56.712]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:57.032 --> 01:19:59.833]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:00.093 --> 01:20:04.235]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:05.495]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.815 --> 01:20:10.377]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.877 --> 01:20:12.999]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:28.193]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:28.233 --> 01:20:35.300]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.801]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:20:54.469 --> 01:20:56.930]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:02.332]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[01:21:02.452 --> 01:21:03.813]  But now, we don't have to.
[01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:12.296]  The Sacra Wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[01:21:12.616 --> 01:21:16.637]  Simply lie on your back with the Sacra Wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[01:21:16.897 --> 01:21:19.678]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[01:21:20.079 --> 01:21:23.580]  Use the Sacra Wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.681]  Get your sacral wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.

[01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:37.223]  And ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:39.903]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[01:21:40.224 --> 01:21:43.524]  Get your sacral wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.

[01:21:44.224 --> 01:21:45.005]  And give yourself a wedgie.
[01:21:55.498 --> 01:21:57.819]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:21:57.839 --> 01:21:59.179]  The real money folks.
[01:22:02.481 --> 01:22:04.382]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:22:04.882 --> 01:22:05.882]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:22:05.942 --> 01:22:07.343]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:22:07.383 --> 01:22:07.803]  A 5% increase.
[01:22:08.403 --> 01:22:10.824]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:22:10.844 --> 01:22:14.025]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:22:23.712 --> 01:22:29.357]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:22:29.957 --> 01:22:33.000]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:38.705]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:41.267 --> 01:22:44.009]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:47.552]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:49.394]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:23:12.549 --> 01:23:15.671]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:16.051 --> 01:23:24.376]  I can think of nothing worse than even if you were a millionaire and could pay for nurses to take care of you.
[01:23:25.297 --> 01:23:31.621]  I couldn't imagine being 75, 80 years old, 90 years old, and not having any family.
[01:23:32.742 --> 01:23:34.222]  Not having anybody to take care of me.
[01:23:34.783 --> 01:23:36.344]  But even worse...
[01:23:37.835 --> 01:23:47.957]  I know people who've got four or five children, and then they just warehouse their parents in a nursing home in another state and go see them like once or twice a year.
[01:23:47.977 --> 01:23:58.359]  I mean, I remember every week driving in from Waukwa into Dallas, into downtown Dallas, to go see my mother's grandmother every week.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.320]  And, you know, she wanted to be in a nursing home.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:06.181]  They offered her to move into their house, and so did her children, but...
[01:24:08.228 --> 01:24:14.673]  She wanted to go to the nursing home, and it was a nice nursing home, and she just didn't want to bother people.
[01:24:14.993 --> 01:24:22.838]  But the point is that, and look, if it makes you mad, I'm sorry.
[01:24:24.099 --> 01:24:26.420]  How can you not take care of your parents?
[01:24:27.281 --> 01:24:28.662]  I mean, they took care of you.
[01:24:30.319 --> 01:24:34.741]  And I know in some cases people's parents have died and they were the only child.
[01:24:34.761 --> 01:24:38.742]  They don't have family or their brother or sister died or they're in prison or whatever.
[01:24:39.182 --> 01:24:40.263]  Nobody can take care of you.
[01:24:40.303 --> 01:24:48.226]  But still, you see, that's why the government openly says in a bunch of different strategy manuals and textbooks that they want to destroy the family.
[01:24:48.706 --> 01:24:50.847]  Because then the state takes total control.
[01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:55.991]  I mean, family's there to help you when your car's broke down and you need a spare or a ride.
[01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:59.754]  Family's there, you know, not just at family reunions.
[01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:03.597]  I mean, even first cousins are supposed to help you.
[01:25:04.238 --> 01:25:05.318]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.482]  I mean, I want to have a whole bunch more children.
[01:25:10.502 --> 01:25:13.305]  I try to talk to my wife and do it all the time.
[01:25:13.925 --> 01:25:18.028]  Just because, number one, they're so wonderful, they're gifts from God, they're so good.
[01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:20.090]  And also, when I'm gone...
[01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:22.279]  I want them to have each other.
[01:25:22.319 --> 01:25:25.940]  I want them to have that community to support each other.
[01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:29.742]  And they're having it drilled into their heads.
[01:25:30.202 --> 01:25:31.382]  You take care of each other.
[01:25:32.983 --> 01:25:34.423]  So they're not alone when they're old.
[01:25:35.103 --> 01:25:36.744]  Imagine how lonely and sad that is.
[01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:45.026]  I mean, all these richy rich people who are so self-centered that, you know, they're 50 years old and they get married to some trophy wife bitch.
[01:25:45.658 --> 01:26:03.855]  Number 10, Bimbo, and she's married to him for five years, and takes him for a million bucks, and then gets another trophy wife, and now they're 70 years old, and then has a stroke, and they're up in a fancy nursing home over the lake.
[01:26:03.895 --> 01:26:04.875]  But what does it mean?
[01:26:04.915 --> 01:26:06.056]  Nobody comes to see them.
[01:26:06.277 --> 01:26:07.157]  They've got nothing.
[01:26:07.378 --> 01:26:08.599]  They serve the New World Order.
[01:26:08.939 --> 01:26:09.740]  You've got nothing.
[01:26:13.436 --> 01:26:18.700]  And, you know, if somebody's really, really sick and has to go to a nursing home, I'm not saying nursing homes are bad, you better go see them every day.
[01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:27.587]  And I've got to say, for my uncle, and, you know, his wife, with her mother, I mean, they went and they saw her every single day.
[01:26:27.647 --> 01:26:30.970]  And when the nursing home didn't do a perfect job, they took her out.
[01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:36.214]  And they put her in their house with them until she died.
[01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:38.736]  And they took care of her.
[01:26:41.918 --> 01:26:42.559]  So, I mean...
[01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:46.361]  But people are so self-centered.
[01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:47.562]  Hey, I feel good right now.
[01:26:47.582 --> 01:26:48.862]  I'm 45 years old.
[01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:49.962]  Why should I care?
[01:26:50.243 --> 01:26:51.403]  Ma's all right.
[01:26:51.723 --> 01:26:52.763]  Ma's all right.
[01:26:53.204 --> 01:27:00.026]  The state over in the nursing home, and you go in there and the room smells like urine, and your mother's got bed sores.
[01:27:00.266 --> 01:27:01.847]  You need to have your teeth knocked out.
[01:27:02.087 --> 01:27:04.428]  You need to have your head stomped on.
[01:27:05.268 --> 01:27:06.268]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:27:06.288 --> 01:27:07.809]  I mean, that is just...
[01:27:08.604 --> 01:27:09.684]  You know what sin is?
[01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:11.385]  It's not supporting life, folks.
[01:27:11.845 --> 01:27:13.806]  Sin is not doing what you're supposed to.
[01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:15.927]  Sin is not following your program.
[01:27:16.567 --> 01:27:19.429]  You better take care of your parents.
[01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:23.650]  And parents, it goes the other way.
[01:27:23.971 --> 01:27:25.631]  You better spend time with your children.
[01:27:25.651 --> 01:27:31.834]  You better watch a few less baseball games and go to a few less bars, and you better spend more time with your family.
[01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:34.829]  Because that's all we got in this world.
[01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.189]  Do you understand that?
[01:27:36.509 --> 01:27:37.749]  It's God's gift to us.
[01:27:37.829 --> 01:27:42.871]  It's the most precious thing in the world, and you flush it down the toilet every day.
[01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:48.432]  If you do not honor your elders, you're not going to be happy.
[01:27:48.652 --> 01:27:57.695]  Don't you understand that by following the law, the law of the universe, God's laws, that you will be rewarded, you will be enriched, you will be...
[01:27:58.664 --> 01:28:02.566]  And for so many people, folks, they're paying for laws they broke 20 years ago.
[01:28:02.586 --> 01:28:05.188]  I'm not talking about the Fed's laws or the state's laws.
[01:28:05.388 --> 01:28:06.328]  I'm talking about the laws.
[01:28:06.348 --> 01:28:10.130]  You know, you jump off a cliff without a parachute and it's 500 feet to the bottom.
[01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:10.951]  You're going to die.
[01:28:12.031 --> 01:28:13.872]  I'm talking about those kind of laws.
[01:28:16.013 --> 01:28:16.334]  You see?
[01:28:16.354 --> 01:28:17.614]  You made me go off.
[01:28:17.694 --> 01:28:20.416]  But I mean, the caller... Listen, I...
[01:28:21.503 --> 01:28:22.023]  I felt it.
[01:28:22.183 --> 01:28:23.684]  I mean, I was worried about this guy.
[01:28:23.984 --> 01:28:25.084]  He's stuck in some place.
[01:28:25.104 --> 01:28:26.144]  They're not taking care of him.
[01:28:26.445 --> 01:28:27.345]  He's in deep trouble.
[01:28:27.685 --> 01:28:29.726]  He got some type of welfare surgery.
[01:28:30.026 --> 01:28:30.686]  He's screwed up.
[01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.406]  I want to help him, but we can't help them all.
[01:28:32.826 --> 01:28:34.227]  I got to take care of my family.
[01:28:35.607 --> 01:28:36.828]  That's who I'm going to take care of.
[01:28:37.468 --> 01:28:38.808]  And you got to take care of yours.
[01:28:39.969 --> 01:28:40.649]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:45.090]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:47.191]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:50.752]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.068 --> 01:28:58.691]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:28:58.751 --> 01:28:59.472]  have diabetes.
[01:28:59.812 --> 01:29:06.757]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:29:06.897 --> 01:29:11.420]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.462]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:29:53.982 --> 01:29:59.204]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.344 --> 01:30:07.427]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.687 --> 01:30:14.749]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.889 --> 01:30:15.850]  We're good to go.
[01:30:44.712 --> 01:30:45.393]  803-4438.

[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:49.101]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.988 --> 01:30:57.871]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:30:58.011 --> 01:30:59.753]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:30:59.833 --> 01:31:01.094]  But not just any water.
[01:31:01.174 --> 01:31:05.377]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:31:05.457 --> 01:31:15.145]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[01:31:15.325 --> 01:31:16.026]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.302 --> 01:31:30.642]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:32:02.242 --> 01:32:08.524]  Well, John, who's running the show, wants me to keep talking about lazy people that don't take care of their family.
[01:32:09.445 --> 01:32:12.626]  You know, that's the good thing about my dad.
[01:32:12.646 --> 01:32:14.546]  I mean, he is just such a hard worker.
[01:32:15.187 --> 01:32:16.287]  He enjoys work.
[01:32:16.347 --> 01:32:17.748]  He enjoys helping his family.
[01:32:18.588 --> 01:32:20.248]  But you can really take advantage of him, though.
[01:32:21.889 --> 01:32:24.530]  I could ask my dad to just come over and change my oil, and he'd do it.
[01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:30.232]  You know, if I told him I was busy and needed his help, or come roof my house if I needed his help, or
[01:32:31.002 --> 01:32:52.254]  He's like that with everybody else, but you've got people like my dad on one end of the extreme who'd go through hell and high water for people in his family, and you've got people on the other side that just have kids and then release them like they're baby squid or something and just off into the ocean current wherever they may go.
[01:32:52.774 --> 01:33:00.639]  We're not animals, folks, but even animals, even mammals, lower mammals, train and take care of their young to a certain point.
[01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:04.437]  And, you know, the government tells you, though, don't instruct your kids.
[01:33:04.497 --> 01:33:05.558]  Don't tell them what to do.
[01:33:06.058 --> 01:33:06.939]  Don't educate them.
[01:33:06.959 --> 01:33:07.780]  Don't inform them.
[01:33:09.101 --> 01:33:13.624]  And they try to train your children that instruction is boring.
[01:33:14.325 --> 01:33:17.247]  No, instruction is supposed to be done in an entertaining way.
[01:33:17.267 --> 01:33:21.370]  You know, teaching that is fun.
[01:33:22.737 --> 01:33:29.839]  And when your child is asking, what's this, what's that, what's this, what's that, the media loves to make fun of that and act like kids are some curse.
[01:33:30.179 --> 01:33:34.700]  No, that's a little computer wanting to understand the universe and wanting to understand how things operate.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.701]  You're supposed to fill that little mind.
[01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:41.262]  You're supposed to make the connections for it so that it can think on its own.
[01:33:43.559 --> 01:33:45.181]  And they just rob us of everything.
[01:33:45.241 --> 01:33:48.343]  I mean, people lust after new Mercedes Benz.
[01:33:48.383 --> 01:33:50.986]  They lust after some new house on the hill.
[01:33:51.046 --> 01:33:57.672]  They obsess on dressing cool and just focus all their energies on it.
[01:33:58.272 --> 01:34:05.459]  And I'm not saying any of those things are bad enough themselves, but when that's the main focus in your life, you're not going to be fulfilled.
[01:34:06.359 --> 01:34:10.323]  And I mean, all the great philosophers discovered this at the end of their research.
[01:34:11.643 --> 01:34:14.125]  You talk to so many people, they've got billions of dollars.
[01:34:14.826 --> 01:34:16.987]  And they're just the most unhappy people you can imagine.
[01:34:17.007 --> 01:34:26.654]  You know, they say, I was a lot happier back in college, you know, when I was working two jobs at the grocery store and the pizza parlor and going to school because I was here.
[01:34:27.255 --> 01:34:28.236]  Now they're not happy.
[01:34:29.116 --> 01:34:33.159]  Because it just... Things really don't matter.
[01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:35.681]  You only need things to be secure.
[01:34:35.721 --> 01:34:39.564]  You only need things to have your nest be comfortable.
[01:34:40.137 --> 01:34:40.497]  We're good to go.
[01:35:10.919 --> 01:35:18.081]  I can't imagine being in the hospital and having no family show up to support me.
[01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:20.422]  I just can't imagine that.
[01:35:20.982 --> 01:35:23.963]  And that means when your family's in the hospital, you've got to go see them.
[01:35:23.983 --> 01:35:26.863]  And you should take pleasure in it.
[01:35:26.883 --> 01:35:29.264]  I mean, it's a good thing.
[01:35:29.304 --> 01:35:30.324]  It's what you're supposed to do.
[01:35:30.344 --> 01:35:32.425]  You're supposed to support your family.
[01:35:33.331 --> 01:35:36.752]  But instead, they're real good at diverting all of your energies.
[01:35:36.812 --> 01:35:40.234]  Instead of spending time with your family, well, I'm involved in the charity league.
[01:35:40.254 --> 01:35:41.914]  Well, I go to all the functions.
[01:35:41.934 --> 01:35:44.875]  Well, I give money to the local CPS group.
[01:35:45.135 --> 01:35:48.657]  Well, I go to this function and that function.
[01:35:49.197 --> 01:35:54.359]  And so the government has moved in to get you to do all of those natural functions.
[01:35:55.046 --> 01:35:59.167]  Those things you're supposed to do and they siphon your energy off into bad things.
[01:35:59.667 --> 01:36:02.448]  So many of you give money to charities you don't even know where the money goes.
[01:36:02.868 --> 01:36:08.770]  So many of you go to these functions and do things that you think are helping but you didn't research to make sure.
[01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:10.991]  You see, that's the other half of charity.
[01:36:11.511 --> 01:36:14.313]  Half of charity is being willing to give and having that giving spirit.
[01:36:14.653 --> 01:36:17.735]  The other half is making sure you're giving in the right place.
[01:36:17.995 --> 01:36:19.636]  And charity starts at home, folks.
[01:36:19.876 --> 01:36:31.003]  If you don't have your house in order and you haven't got your family in order and you haven't defended your family and taken care of your family first, then you don't have any business running around out there.
[01:36:31.063 --> 01:36:34.325]  I'm talking about all these yuppies and all these nouveau riche women.
[01:36:35.695 --> 01:36:36.996]  Oh, good morning, Alan.
[01:37:05.379 --> 01:37:09.420]  You know, you are truly the Paul Revere of the 20th century, in my opinion.
[01:37:10.141 --> 01:37:11.321]  Well, you are too, then.
[01:37:12.361 --> 01:37:14.162]  I'm a former off-knight.
[01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.983]  I have a comment about illegal immigration.
[01:37:17.043 --> 01:37:20.824]  I just wanted to mention to you real quickly, I'm a former off-knight.
[01:37:20.864 --> 01:37:24.405]  I used to live there in Hyde Park, Avenue G. You know where that area is?
[01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:25.385]  Sure do.
[01:37:25.765 --> 01:37:26.026]  Sure.
[01:37:26.206 --> 01:37:29.927]  And lived in Dallas for four years, lower Greenville area.
[01:37:30.767 --> 01:37:32.087]  So I know Texas very well.
[01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:33.668]  Um...
[01:37:34.489 --> 01:37:41.894]  I'm in Phoenix, Arizona, Alex, and this illegal immigration issue could not be more personified than here.
[01:37:43.054 --> 01:37:47.257]  The illegal Mexicans have literally taken over this city.
[01:37:47.397 --> 01:38:02.346]  All the middle class people are moving to outer areas such as Scottsdale, and they're building homes at a record rate with Mexican labor, of course.
[01:38:03.021 --> 01:38:06.802]  You can't find an American citizen on a construction site in this town.
[01:38:07.922 --> 01:38:14.023]  You cannot find a carpenter... Again, that's because they'll work for half the wages and it knocks out whole strata.
[01:38:14.263 --> 01:38:16.564]  And so before it was just picking vegetables and stuff.
[01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.744]  Now it's the construction jobs.
[01:38:18.804 --> 01:38:21.465]  Now it's the high-tech engineering computer jobs.
[01:38:21.665 --> 01:38:22.725]  They bring in the Indians.
[01:38:23.025 --> 01:38:24.046]  It's undercutting.
[01:38:24.106 --> 01:38:26.466]  It's lowering the standard of living.
[01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:29.607]  I know that, but I want to know your opinion.
[01:38:30.751 --> 01:38:33.973]  Who is financing this?
[01:38:34.013 --> 01:38:34.553]  We know who.
[01:38:35.234 --> 01:38:40.617]  The new home construction in this town is exploding, and I'm wondering, well, who are they?
[01:38:40.897 --> 01:38:42.638]  Where is this money coming from?
[01:38:43.078 --> 01:38:44.439]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:38:44.939 --> 01:38:48.341]  There's a bunch of different factors coming together to give you the perfect storm.
[01:38:48.982 --> 01:38:54.045]  You know that the dollar's been devalued by about 45%, though it just went back up by 4%.
[01:38:54.785 --> 01:38:56.666]  So the dollar's been devalued by 41%.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:09.605]  And so the Federal Reserve has caused this by printing $5.5 trillion in the last three years.
[01:39:09.745 --> 01:39:18.009]  So real estate is overvalued, but at least there's some real value there, better than just having fiat notes in a bank account.
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:20.971]  And so what's happened here...
[01:39:22.886 --> 01:39:26.928]  Is that money is rushing into construction, rushing into real estate.
[01:39:26.948 --> 01:39:34.051]  There is a bubble, but at least there's more density and true value in that bubble than there is in the total fiat bubble.
[01:39:34.828 --> 01:39:36.209]  That's a bubble without a bubble.
[01:39:36.289 --> 01:39:40.091]  It's just hot air that is the fiat currency.
[01:39:40.512 --> 01:39:45.375]  But the Ford Foundation, the federal government, both parties, they want to drive down wages.
[01:39:45.435 --> 01:39:46.895]  Their enemy is the middle class.
[01:39:47.296 --> 01:39:52.079]  Whether you're a Hispanic in the middle class or a black person or an Asian or a white, they don't care.
[01:39:52.499 --> 01:40:00.944]  They want to get rid of the middle class, and they're going to use Latin American labor predominantly, and Chinese labor as well, to get rid of that middle class, and it's working quite nicely.
[01:40:01.522 --> 01:40:03.123]  Well, it's very obvious here.
[01:40:03.443 --> 01:40:11.026]  It's almost like a Tower of Babel here in the Phoenix area.
[01:40:11.586 --> 01:40:15.288]  You can't find a normal American store.
[01:40:15.588 --> 01:40:17.068]  I mean, everything is Hispanic.
[01:40:18.049 --> 01:40:25.052]  Everything in this town has been totally transformed into what I call Tijuana, Arizona.
[01:40:26.612 --> 01:40:28.833]  It's not American City anymore.
[01:40:28.853 --> 01:40:31.074]  No, I understand you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:40:32.356 --> 01:40:45.581]  And then, as if that isn't bad enough then, the federal government, the Mexican government, all these big foundations are giving them literature in comic book format, so even people with a third grade education can understand it, saying, this is your country.
[01:40:46.061 --> 01:40:51.063]  Why would the big money in New York tell these people, take over America, whites are your enemies?
[01:40:52.104 --> 01:40:59.266]  When you go to Mexico, and literally it's six foot four white people ruling over the indigenous population.
[01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:00.747]  Very racist in Mexico.
[01:41:01.368 --> 01:41:02.649]  Their entire leadership.
[01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:04.850]  I mean, literally, go to their Congress online.
[01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:05.831]  Look at the pictures of the people.
[01:41:06.051 --> 01:41:06.912]  Look at their surnames.
[01:41:07.052 --> 01:41:13.536]  Schmidt and Johnson and Hockengrogle and Swartz.
[01:41:14.317 --> 01:41:15.457]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:41:16.678 --> 01:41:17.319]  It's a joke.
[01:41:17.359 --> 01:41:28.146]  And I'm just sitting here, and the big money comes in, and the banks finance, the radio stations are called the Invaders, the Invasion, the Takeover, the Aslan, the Race.
[01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:29.967]  They've got stations called the Race.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.661]  You're like, what is this?
[01:41:33.262 --> 01:41:33.782]  It's simple.
[01:41:33.842 --> 01:41:37.265]  I mean, Mexico's population has gone from 15 million to 100 million.
[01:41:37.845 --> 01:41:40.407]  The next 20 years it will go up another 100 million.
[01:41:40.487 --> 01:41:41.108]  Seriously.
[01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:44.210]  And it's that simple.
[01:41:46.351 --> 01:41:49.874]  And this is going to be Latin America.
[01:41:50.454 --> 01:41:55.318]  And it will just be like in Latin America where the globalists own the leaders and we're all peons, folks.
[01:41:56.673 --> 01:42:01.816]  And somehow the peons will all feel good because everywhere will be Mexican flags.
[01:42:01.976 --> 01:42:04.158]  We'll all be slaves and there'll be Mexican flags.
[01:42:04.198 --> 01:42:09.381]  Instead of climbing out of the murk, the globalists are going to make sure that we all just stay in it.
[01:42:11.422 --> 01:42:13.103]  And that's the plan.
[01:42:13.143 --> 01:42:15.324]  Bring America down at any cost.
[01:42:16.265 --> 01:42:18.146]  And believe me, sir, I know what you're talking about.
[01:42:18.987 --> 01:42:19.547]  I mean, I know.
[01:42:21.269 --> 01:42:27.195]  Can you imagine if there was a town where only English could be spoken in court proceedings?
[01:42:29.337 --> 01:42:32.500]  Why, there'd be FBI investigations and Justice Department lawsuits.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.003]  But there's, what, five, six towns now on the Texas border.
[01:42:36.043 --> 01:42:38.465]  El Cenizo was the first eight years ago.
[01:42:39.166 --> 01:42:41.728]  San Antonio Express News, ten-part series, back in 98'.
[01:42:43.632 --> 01:42:46.753]  I remember liberal Shannon Burke, a local radio station, couldn't believe it.
[01:42:46.773 --> 01:42:47.893]  He goes, have you seen this?
[01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:49.573]  El Cenizo, you're right, Alex.
[01:42:50.053 --> 01:42:50.494]  Look at this.
[01:42:50.574 --> 01:42:51.714]  No English allowed.
[01:42:51.734 --> 01:42:55.775]  Basically, if you're white and live in the town, you're kicked out.
[01:42:56.675 --> 01:42:58.115]  It's a racial state.
[01:42:58.855 --> 01:43:00.036]  A racial state.
[01:43:01.416 --> 01:43:04.957]  And you talk to people running this racial state, they don't even know what the racial state is.
[01:43:06.797 --> 01:43:08.157]  It's like, we're Chicano.
[01:43:08.197 --> 01:43:09.017]  Well, what is that?
[01:43:09.598 --> 01:43:10.318]  It's Chicano.
[01:43:10.358 --> 01:43:10.738]  Well, it's...
[01:43:12.043 --> 01:43:15.104]  It's Spanish, Anglo, and Native American.
[01:43:15.144 --> 01:43:16.465]  I mean, just so what?
[01:43:18.326 --> 01:43:20.386]  And no, I mean, it's amazing.
[01:43:21.667 --> 01:43:23.067]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:43:23.988 --> 01:43:25.408]  And it's just going to get worse and worse.
[01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:28.890]  And our standard of living is going to go down, down, down.
[01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:37.193]  That's why the majority of American Hispanics, the vast majority, it's almost 70%, are against the open borders.
[01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:37.913]  Because they know.
[01:43:38.314 --> 01:43:39.394]  And those numbers are growing.
[01:43:40.106 --> 01:43:41.587]  But a lot of them feel like it's peer pressure.
[01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:45.850]  Well, if I'm against the open borders, then I'm against my people.
[01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:47.411]  The news told me.
[01:43:48.151 --> 01:43:49.092]  No, you're not.
[01:43:49.372 --> 01:43:50.933]  Your people are your children.
[01:43:51.814 --> 01:43:53.515]  You want them living in Mexico City?
[01:43:53.535 --> 01:43:56.116]  If it's so good, move down there now.
[01:43:56.136 --> 01:44:02.140]  Because that's what Phoenix and San Antonio and Houston and L.A.
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.382]  are going to be in the next 20 years, folks.
[01:44:04.722 --> 01:44:06.343]  Can you say 200 billion people?
[01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:13.113]  At the average age of 16, ladies and gentlemen, they start having children.
[01:44:13.353 --> 01:44:20.899]  They have an average of 4.5, which I don't blame people wanting to have kids, but if you're going to have kids, you better have money to take care of them.
[01:44:20.919 --> 01:44:22.280]  That's the important part of the equation.
[01:44:23.001 --> 01:44:23.982]  And the globalists just love it.
[01:44:24.002 --> 01:44:25.143]  They're going, well, look at this.
[01:44:25.663 --> 01:44:31.347]  We're going to have another 100 million slaves, that's what they call them, here to do whatever we want.
[01:44:31.368 --> 01:44:32.368]  The middle class, it's over.
[01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:38.193]  The globalists have used China and a billion, 300 plus million slaves over there
[01:44:39.901 --> 01:44:40.861]  They don't like hearing it.
[01:44:40.921 --> 01:44:42.922]  None are so enslaved as those that don't know it.
[01:44:43.462 --> 01:44:44.682]  Who are slaves and don't know it.
[01:44:44.742 --> 01:44:45.482]  Paraphrase there.
[01:44:46.322 --> 01:44:49.123]  And they've used that slave labor to leverage out all our companies.
[01:44:49.163 --> 01:44:50.623]  We're totally deindustrialized.
[01:44:50.903 --> 01:44:55.344]  And they've used those select deals for Walmart and a few other retailers to take over everything.
[01:44:55.644 --> 01:44:56.445]  Same story.
[01:44:57.845 --> 01:45:00.005]  This is economic warfare.
[01:45:00.465 --> 01:45:02.846]  And the globalists sit up there in their ivory towers, folks.
[01:45:03.857 --> 01:45:10.662]  And their armored compounds they're using the Latin Americans, they're using the Chinese, they're using India to shut down our computer programming.
[01:45:10.862 --> 01:45:12.343]  They've hit us at every level.
[01:45:13.324 --> 01:45:17.427]  Our children have absolutely no future if this goes on just a few more years.
[01:45:17.747 --> 01:45:19.188]  It's already probably too late.
[01:45:20.249 --> 01:45:22.030]  Right now we're just trying to salvage something.
[01:45:22.170 --> 01:45:31.116]  We're trying to pull out of this crash dive and maybe get some landing gear down and get some flaps up and somehow try to slow down a little bit so maybe there's some survivors.
[01:45:31.777 --> 01:45:33.478]  And I use that as a paraphrase for the economy.
[01:45:34.511 --> 01:45:40.024]  I mean, we're coming in right now at full speed towards the ground and we've got just a few minutes to try to...
[01:45:41.423 --> 01:45:43.484]  Get the landing gear down and try to do a crash landing.
[01:45:43.524 --> 01:45:44.465]  I mean, that's all I'm doing.
[01:45:44.485 --> 01:45:44.865]  Mayday!
[01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:45.205]  Mayday!
[01:45:45.365 --> 01:45:45.845]  Get ready!
[01:45:45.885 --> 01:45:47.206]  We've been under massive attack!
[01:45:47.446 --> 01:45:50.488]  And finally, because everything's falling apart, people are finally listening.
[01:45:50.528 --> 01:45:52.669]  Hey, I heard them on the news say global government.
[01:45:52.929 --> 01:45:54.350]  Maybe that Alex Jones isn't lying.
[01:45:54.570 --> 01:45:58.091]  Hey, I found out Roberts is anti-gun at CBS News.
[01:45:58.311 --> 01:45:59.032]  They're praising him.
[01:45:59.072 --> 01:45:59.952]  He's anti-gun.
[01:46:00.172 --> 01:46:01.513]  I thought he was pro-gun, Bush.
[01:46:01.753 --> 01:46:02.313]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:46:02.333 --> 01:46:03.614]  Maybe Alex isn't lying to us.
[01:46:03.874 --> 01:46:05.495]  Hey, I heard Bush call for amnesty.
[01:46:05.655 --> 01:46:07.976]  Hey, I heard about cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:46:08.356 --> 01:46:08.777]  Hey, what?
[01:46:08.937 --> 01:46:09.057]  What?
[01:46:09.577 --> 01:46:09.937]  Finally!
[01:46:10.298 --> 01:46:11.459]  And finally they're starting to hear me.
[01:46:11.639 --> 01:46:12.179]  Mayday!
[01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:13.140]  We're going down!
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:13.841]  Whoop!
[01:46:13.981 --> 01:46:14.541]  Whoop!
[01:46:14.681 --> 01:46:15.062]  Whoop!
[01:46:15.122 --> 01:46:15.802]  Emergency!
[01:46:16.182 --> 01:46:19.805]  This scrap will self-destruct in T-minus two years.
[01:46:20.206 --> 01:46:20.526]  Doop!
[01:46:20.826 --> 01:46:21.186]  Doop!
[01:46:21.447 --> 01:46:21.767]  Doop!
[01:46:21.987 --> 01:46:22.387]  Ten!
[01:46:22.708 --> 01:46:23.108]  Nine!
[01:46:23.468 --> 01:46:23.668]  Eight!
[01:46:24.009 --> 01:46:24.389]  Seven!
[01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:25.010]  Six!
[01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.770]  Five!
[01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.431]  Four!
[01:46:26.691 --> 01:46:27.071]  Three!
[01:46:27.371 --> 01:46:27.712]  Two!
[01:46:28.192 --> 01:46:28.372]  One!
[01:46:28.632 --> 01:46:29.333]  Detonate!
[01:46:30.134 --> 01:46:31.034]  World government!
[01:46:31.335 --> 01:46:32.656]  You know, I mean, we're here, folks.
[01:46:32.996 --> 01:46:33.837]  This was the Alamo.
[01:46:33.857 --> 01:46:35.058]  We're swinging our muskets.
[01:46:35.458 --> 01:46:37.580]  I'm about to go into the powder keg here.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.081]  I mean, it's just...
[01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:42.812]  Up against it, point-blank range, total destruction.
[01:46:43.073 --> 01:46:54.999]  The new order's got every one of its guns aimed at the U.S., firing, blowing everything to pieces, consolidating the power, setting up a police state, openly calling for martial law, openly conditioning everybody to accept it.
[01:46:56.319 --> 01:47:00.702]  Meanwhile, we're all thinking we've had a victory, because they know that we're waking up, so they want to give us a little false victory.
[01:47:00.782 --> 01:47:01.842]  Oh, look, Bush is in trouble.
[01:47:02.142 --> 01:47:03.823]  Oh, look, ooh, as if he runs anything.
[01:47:04.143 --> 01:47:07.385]  Oh, well, sorry I'm getting ripped off on gas prices, but that's okay.
[01:47:09.403 --> 01:47:12.466]  Because at least Bush is in trouble.
[01:47:14.548 --> 01:47:15.829]  No, they've laid waste to us.
[01:47:16.349 --> 01:47:18.391]  But the good news is people are finally waking up.
[01:47:18.411 --> 01:47:21.834]  People are starting to look around and go, my God, this is global government.
[01:47:23.376 --> 01:47:24.977]  We really are losing our freedoms.
[01:47:25.037 --> 01:47:26.939]  And they're asking the good Lord above for help.
[01:47:27.439 --> 01:47:29.061]  Well, God helps those that help themselves.
[01:47:29.733 --> 01:47:32.655]  Let's go to Rodkin in Vermont.
[01:47:32.675 --> 01:47:33.595]  Go ahead, Rodkin.
[01:47:34.276 --> 01:47:35.436]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:47:35.576 --> 01:47:38.378]  You are just so moving and inspiring.
[01:47:39.018 --> 01:47:42.400]  You even make me laugh during these serious times.
[01:47:42.981 --> 01:47:44.261]  And I don't often laugh.
[01:47:45.222 --> 01:47:46.082]  I'll get to the point.
[01:47:46.123 --> 01:47:56.408]  A friend of mine was asking where... You were reading off, oh, weeks ago, a list of what FEMA was supposed to do to...
[01:48:00.187 --> 01:48:23.247]  Where does one Google that FEMA document that tells them to delay the food and the supplies and the water and lock people up and cut the emergency communication lines, all that stuff?
[01:48:24.065 --> 01:48:31.632]  Well, we wrote a big article with dozens and dozens of news articles and each admission of what they do.
[01:48:31.652 --> 01:48:34.174]  And their main job is to take control.
[01:48:34.194 --> 01:48:36.756]  So I think you're confused of what we were saying.
[01:48:37.417 --> 01:48:42.721]  But we know that they blocked the communication lines and jammed from day one when Katrina came in.
[01:48:43.122 --> 01:48:45.804]  We know that they cut police lines and cut towers.
[01:48:46.124 --> 01:48:50.726]  We know in three parishes the sheriffs had to call out armed police to guard against FEMA.
[01:48:51.026 --> 01:48:52.546]  We know FEMA held back the food.
[01:48:52.566 --> 01:48:59.409]  There was food there for two days in front of the people at the sports dome as they were bugging with troops aiming guns at them.
[01:48:59.789 --> 01:49:10.113]  They had to have things break down to then go, see, only martial law will keep you safe, so Bush could go on TV and say, we need to get rid of posse comitatus to stop problems like this from happening.
[01:49:10.638 --> 01:49:13.841]  Okay, I thought it was something like the P2OG document.
[01:49:14.261 --> 01:49:16.383]  Well, there are FEMA documents, but you know what?
[01:49:16.423 --> 01:49:21.127]  Right now, I'm not getting enough info from you to specifically remember or know what you're talking about.
[01:49:22.448 --> 01:49:29.034]  Okay, I couldn't believe the other day when you were interviewing Janice Karpinski that she didn't know about P2OG.
[01:49:29.074 --> 01:49:38.442]  And I know you'd explain it as compartmentalization, but, you know, I wonder what rock these people are living under that they aren't aware of what their troops are having to...
[01:49:39.315 --> 01:49:40.556]  The confronting.
[01:49:41.917 --> 01:49:43.838]  You want to talk about P20G?
[01:49:43.898 --> 01:49:44.398]  Are you done?
[01:49:44.418 --> 01:49:45.479]  I am done.
[01:49:45.599 --> 01:49:45.959]  Thank you.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:47.120]  Thank you for the call.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:47.761]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:47.781 --> 01:49:52.163]  Hopefully it will pop in my head what you're talking about.
[01:49:52.204 --> 01:49:52.684]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.381]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.541 --> 01:49:58.642]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.762 --> 01:50:02.664]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.724 --> 01:50:06.947]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.307 --> 01:50:11.069]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:13.070]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.190 --> 01:50:16.511]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.571 --> 01:50:17.632]  The medical bills.
[01:50:18.493 --> 01:50:21.276]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.437 --> 01:50:24.461]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:27.565]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[01:50:28.005 --> 01:50:34.134]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.634 --> 01:50:35.155]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.649 --> 01:50:57.211]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:57.251 --> 01:50:57.771]  are located?
[01:50:57.971 --> 01:51:01.353]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:51:01.573 --> 01:51:06.295]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:52:58.564 --> 01:53:00.465]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.945 --> 01:53:03.766]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.907 --> 01:53:07.148]  I love taking calls.
[01:53:07.168 --> 01:53:08.208]  You know, we alternate.
[01:53:08.228 --> 01:53:11.550]  Some days we'll have three or four guests on, sometimes five guests a show.
[01:53:12.130 --> 01:53:16.732]  Other days we'll just take calls the entire time, and sometimes we'll do nothing but cover news.
[01:53:19.927 --> 01:53:20.928]  I'm going to do this.
[01:53:20.948 --> 01:53:26.793]  I'm going to leapfrog back and forth between news and your calls in the next hour, and I'm going to keep each caller down to about a minute.
[01:53:27.313 --> 01:53:28.995]  I always say that and never do it, but I'm going to try.
[01:53:29.015 --> 01:53:31.176]  And we're going to go through a lot of your phone calls.
[01:53:31.196 --> 01:53:32.838]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:32.858 --> 01:53:32.918]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:32.938 --> 01:53:34.019]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:53:34.039 --> 01:53:36.861]  Before I go to Ed and Jim and others that have been holding along with us,
[01:53:50.265 --> 01:53:56.626]  Coming up this Thursday, 7 o'clock, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, Austin, Texas.
[01:53:56.766 --> 01:53:57.787]  Big, nice theater.
[01:53:57.867 --> 01:53:58.847]  Food, drinks, everything.
[01:53:59.347 --> 01:54:03.688]  I'll be there with my books and videos and have a table out front.
[01:54:04.288 --> 01:54:05.608]  Be glad to shake your hand.
[01:54:06.288 --> 01:54:08.829]  Meet a lot of great, like-minded people at these events.
[01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:12.229]  And Jack Blood's going to be coming out to this event as well.
[01:54:12.249 --> 01:54:14.590]  Another one of the local guys fighting the New World Order.
[01:54:15.462 --> 01:54:20.467]  And I'm going to be showing the new film, The Order of Death, which is now 45 minutes long.
[01:54:20.527 --> 01:54:21.248]  It is completed.
[01:54:21.989 --> 01:54:28.436]  And the new Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, remastered, new information added, really beefed up.
[01:54:29.757 --> 01:54:32.940]  And by beefed up, we've cut 35 minutes out of the film.
[01:54:33.541 --> 01:54:34.902]  But it's even better for that.
[01:54:34.962 --> 01:54:35.263]  It's been...
[01:54:36.258 --> 01:54:37.419]  Have more information added.
[01:54:37.979 --> 01:54:40.240]  So, total, two hours, ten minutes of footage.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.041]  We'll have a speech and a question and answer as well.
[01:54:43.561 --> 01:54:52.245]  Be sure and go to infowars.com to link through to the Alamo Draft House website and to purchase your tickets before they sell out.
[01:54:52.805 --> 01:54:54.807]  And they could sell out any time now, folks.
[01:54:55.487 --> 01:54:56.548]  We'll tell you when they do.
[01:54:56.628 --> 01:54:58.770]  But go ahead and get your tickets today.
[01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:59.290]  Don't wait.
[01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:00.752]  Go to Infowars.com and get them.
[01:55:01.032 --> 01:55:08.078]  Or if you don't have a computer and you live in the Austin area, drive down South Lamar, get your tickets to the box office right now, or have your...
[01:55:10.126 --> 01:55:17.791]  Have one of your friends or family who work on South Lamar near there drop by and get a ticket for themselves and get a ticket for yourself and you can reimburse them.
[01:55:18.091 --> 01:55:22.614]  I hope to see you out there coming up this Thursday, 7 o'clock for the Order of Death.
[01:55:22.634 --> 01:55:25.236]  It's not even out on DVD or VHS yet, folks.
[01:55:25.696 --> 01:55:27.077]  It hasn't even gone to the duplicators yet.
[01:55:27.117 --> 01:55:28.058]  It's about to this week.
[01:55:28.939 --> 01:55:30.079]  So it's not even available yet.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:33.021]  It's online for prisonplanet.tv members.
[01:55:33.061 --> 01:55:33.902]  They've been able to see it.
[01:55:34.833 --> 01:55:42.577]  But come out, and I hope to see you out there this Thursday, 7 o'clock, Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar.
[01:55:43.817 --> 01:55:54.763]  And in case you don't live in Central Texas, if you live in Ohio or New York or California, or in case you live in East Texas or Pensacola, Florida or Kansas City, Missouri, wherever you live,
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:58.621]  Get my videos by going to InfoWars.com.
[01:55:58.641 --> 01:56:00.121]  You can look at all the different videos.
[01:56:00.501 --> 01:56:02.522]  Read about all the new specials we're offering.
[01:56:03.022 --> 01:56:04.202]  Three DVDs.
[01:56:04.302 --> 01:56:05.742]  Three of my films for $44.95.
[01:56:07.023 --> 01:56:13.144]  I mean, normally that's... Normally three videos is what?
[01:56:13.364 --> 01:56:13.144]  $75.
[01:56:13.384 --> 01:56:14.784]  $25 a piece.
[01:56:14.844 --> 01:56:16.325]  This is $45.
[01:56:17.345 --> 01:56:18.445]  I mean, do the math.
[01:56:18.465 --> 01:56:20.105]  We're talking a huge discount.
[01:56:20.686 --> 01:56:22.286]  Got a bunch of other specials we're offering.
[01:56:24.086 --> 01:56:26.907]  So it's really important to take advantage of them.
[01:56:27.287 --> 01:56:33.010]  Go to Infowars.com and look at all those new specials we've got on the main page.
[01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:34.451]  Get the videos.
[01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:35.491]  Make copies of them.
[01:56:36.071 --> 01:56:37.532]  Get them out to your friends and family.
[01:56:37.572 --> 01:56:38.692]  Get them on AXS TV.
[01:56:38.733 --> 01:56:40.673]  I want to commend those that have done that.
[01:56:41.014 --> 01:56:42.074]  Or call toll-free.
[01:56:42.114 --> 01:56:46.256]  They can tell you all about the different specials or send you out a free brochure if you'd like that.
[01:56:46.676 --> 01:56:47.317]  It's 1... That's 1...
[01:56:51.891 --> 01:57:15.306]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or as I said, go to InfoWars.com, order via the shopping cart, or PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, see all my weekly TV reports, all my documentaries, including now my 13th film, Ooh Spooky, The Order of Death.
[01:57:17.694 --> 01:57:20.114]  I didn't think of that, but I guess it kind of fits into the montage.
[01:57:20.214 --> 01:57:22.235]  It's not the word, not montage.
[01:57:22.715 --> 01:57:30.656]  It kind of fits into the... The point is, you need to get these videos.
[01:57:31.017 --> 01:57:32.617]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:50.701]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:52.422]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.122 --> 01:57:54.263]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.904 --> 01:57:55.704]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.465 --> 01:57:57.386]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.026 --> 01:58:01.729]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:06.332]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.452 --> 01:58:07.793]  Music
[01:58:17.344 --> 01:58:23.597]  Now into the third and final hour of this Tuesday, 25th of October, 2005, Transmission Against Tyranny.
[01:58:24.058 --> 01:58:27.064]  I was making the point that my 13th film is out.
[01:58:28.445 --> 01:58:30.306]  Only for prisonplanet.tv members.
[01:58:30.826 --> 01:58:34.467]  They got the early version of it that was 40 minutes long, the new 45-minute version.
[01:58:34.487 --> 01:58:45.272]  It's going to be going up in the next few days, but they will be showing it at the Alamo Draft House this Thursday at 7 o'clock, along with the remastered, re-edited Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:58:45.312 --> 01:58:47.633]  So you get to watch two movies for the price of one.
[01:58:48.213 --> 01:58:49.994]  One a full-length feature, one a shorter doc.
[01:58:50.434 --> 01:58:53.435]  Order of Death, 45 minutes, is considered a short film.
[01:58:55.016 --> 01:58:55.176]  But...
[01:58:57.176 --> 01:59:00.057]  I was making the point to do my 13th film.
[01:59:00.097 --> 01:59:01.018]  I didn't think about that.
[01:59:01.478 --> 01:59:04.079]  It kind of has the right ambiance.
[01:59:04.899 --> 01:59:06.620]  But that's not the proper term.
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:08.180]  I would say the theme.
[01:59:08.361 --> 01:59:10.922]  It fits with the occultic theme that it's the 13th film.
[01:59:11.322 --> 01:59:12.442]  That was not done by design.
[01:59:13.583 --> 01:59:19.265]  So I hope to see you out there this Thursday, 7 o'clock, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:59:20.242 --> 01:59:22.423]  But get your tickets before it's sold out.
[01:59:22.864 --> 01:59:25.745]  They've always sold out two or three days beforehand.
[01:59:25.986 --> 01:59:31.829]  This is the first time they haven't sold out two or three days, sometimes four or five days beforehand.
[01:59:32.129 --> 01:59:35.031]  There are still tickets left, at least as of last night.
[01:59:35.051 --> 01:59:36.112]  So if you want them, get them.
[01:59:36.392 --> 01:59:37.913]  All right, I belabored that enough.
[01:59:38.593 --> 01:59:39.374]  I belabored it.
[01:59:39.994 --> 01:59:40.875]  Hope to see you out there.
[01:59:42.176 --> 01:59:42.656]  I'll be there.
[01:59:42.676 --> 01:59:43.416]  Hope to see you there.
[01:59:44.417 --> 01:59:45.798]  We're going to take a few more calls.
[01:59:46.454 --> 01:59:48.494]  Then I'm going to plunge into New York Times.
[01:59:48.935 --> 01:59:51.375]  Cheney first disclosed CIA official's name.
[01:59:52.135 --> 01:59:54.916]  Also, this is from CBS News.
[01:59:54.936 --> 02:00:04.078]  A little story about Mike Wallace, but in it they admit that, well, the new Supreme Court Justice, the Chief Justice, is pro-gun control.
[02:00:04.978 --> 02:00:08.599]  They were really good at keeping that quiet, but now they can let us know.
[02:00:08.639 --> 02:00:10.099]  We can all celebrate.
[02:00:10.759 --> 02:00:11.779]  We're good conservatives.
[02:00:11.819 --> 02:00:12.959]  Let's turn our guns in.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.320]  New bird flu cases in Europe and Russia.
[02:00:16.489 --> 02:00:18.671]  Moves to put brain chips in the troops.
[02:00:18.871 --> 02:00:19.472]  I'm not kidding.
[02:00:20.252 --> 02:00:21.714]  Stuff's getting weirder and weirder.
[02:00:23.575 --> 02:00:29.640]  A super storm brewing right now as the remains of Hurricane Wilma and the Tropical Depression merge.
[02:00:30.061 --> 02:00:30.721]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:31.022 --> 02:00:34.585]  Right now, though, let's go to Ed in Pennsylvania, then Jim in Boston.
[02:00:34.965 --> 02:00:35.525]  Ed, welcome.
[02:00:36.566 --> 02:00:37.007]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:37.447 --> 02:00:37.727]  Hi.
[02:00:38.668 --> 02:00:42.351]  Last week you had Bill Sardi on and Dr. Horowitz.
[02:00:42.932 --> 02:00:44.453]  Yes, great, great, great men.
[02:00:45.134 --> 02:00:45.614]  Yeah, great show.
[02:00:45.634 --> 02:00:49.737]  And they were talking about elderberry, black elderberry juice for the flu.
[02:00:50.117 --> 02:01:01.524]  And I just want to let your viewers know that the best source would be to go on the Internet and find a elderberry juice concentrate.
[02:01:01.944 --> 02:01:03.745]  Well, I know what's in my medicine cabinet.
[02:01:03.765 --> 02:01:05.586]  We've got five bottles of it.
[02:01:06.026 --> 02:01:08.628]  The best stuff's available right here in health food stores.
[02:01:09.478 --> 02:01:12.499]  And, yeah, it's a great antiviral.
[02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:24.483]  Even medical mainline MD studies, double-blind studies, show it's much more effective than trash like Tamiflu that Rumsfeld and the Bilderberg group is going to make a bunch of money off of.
[02:01:25.203 --> 02:01:33.146]  Well, I compared Sambuca, which is an extract, to the pure concentrated juice, and the concentrated juice is 100 times better.
[02:01:33.866 --> 02:01:37.107]  Just to let people know not to waste their money on the Sambuca stuff.
[02:01:38.286 --> 02:01:39.907]  All right, well, I've never heard of Sambuca.
[02:01:40.408 --> 02:01:43.450]  That's like an extract they sell at a lot of health food stores.
[02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.991]  Sounds like a pretty serious fellow, though.
[02:01:46.051 --> 02:01:51.355]  I'm not going to mess with Sambuca.
[02:01:51.435 --> 02:01:58.340]  Yeah, but the pure concentrate you can buy over the Internet, and you can get a good price, and that's the best what you want.
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:05.365]  When I was a kid, my uncle used to pick trash bags full of elderberries up in the Poconos, and my aunt would make, my Ukrainian aunt would make...
[02:02:06.263 --> 02:02:07.704]  Wine and jams and jellies with it.
[02:02:08.004 --> 02:02:11.346]  How dare her make delicious jellies that are good for you?
[02:02:12.807 --> 02:02:17.130]  Weirdos actually get into making their own food.
[02:02:17.170 --> 02:02:18.391]  Just buy the McDonald's.
[02:02:19.492 --> 02:02:19.732]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:19.892 --> 02:02:20.092]  Yeah.
[02:02:21.373 --> 02:02:21.633]  Look.
[02:02:21.653 --> 02:02:22.313]  Back to nature.
[02:02:22.774 --> 02:02:25.375]  Look, if you grow your own food, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:26.356 --> 02:02:32.340]  It's horrible walking through the woods on a beautiful day, picking berries and going back and making a big steaming pie out of it.
[02:02:33.203 --> 02:02:35.908]  No, just go eat some slop with MSG in it.
[02:02:36.369 --> 02:02:38.152]  How dare you, Ed?
[02:02:38.172 --> 02:02:41.217]  Man, I tell you, that's a sure sign of Alcada membership.
[02:02:41.618 --> 02:02:42.539]  Being self-sufficient.
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.401]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.886 --> 02:02:49.747]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.008 --> 02:02:51.588]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.908 --> 02:02:56.591]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.931 --> 02:03:03.674]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.994 --> 02:03:05.974]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.175 --> 02:03:09.035]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:13.776]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.976 --> 02:03:18.397]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.637 --> 02:03:25.839]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.099 --> 02:03:28.520]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:46.113 --> 02:03:54.718]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:54.939 --> 02:04:06.226]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:06.426 --> 02:04:09.107]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:09.427 --> 02:04:13.490]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:14.191]  We're good to go.

[02:04:29.613 --> 02:04:31.015]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.702 --> 02:04:53.026]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:53.326 --> 02:04:58.631]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:04:59.051 --> 02:05:02.053]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:05:04.635 --> 02:05:09.379]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[02:05:09.759 --> 02:05:10.200]  We're good to go.
[02:05:26.901 --> 02:05:27.361]  We're good to go.
[02:05:50.086 --> 02:05:50.727]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.387 --> 02:05:52.468]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.169 --> 02:05:54.290]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.930 --> 02:05:55.731]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.511 --> 02:05:57.352]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.073 --> 02:06:02.016]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.236 --> 02:06:06.379]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:10.783]  Really, you can divide the world into two different types of people.
[02:06:12.664 --> 02:06:14.746]  Folks that do care and people that don't care.
[02:06:16.548 --> 02:06:16.728]  Now...
[02:06:19.398 --> 02:06:27.142]  The globalists are good at manipulating well-meaning people who do care into contributing and helping them set up a new world order.
[02:06:27.242 --> 02:06:35.846]  So much of the new world order's strength comes out of well-meaning, zealot believers who really think they're serving a good cause.
[02:06:36.486 --> 02:06:38.927]  That's why that science fiction movie Serenity is so good.
[02:06:38.967 --> 02:06:41.388]  It's got such a good message.
[02:06:41.408 --> 02:06:42.489]  That's why it's so popular.
[02:06:42.869 --> 02:06:44.329]  Extremely anti-government.
[02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:47.531]  You know, half of history is covering up the truth and
[02:06:48.305 --> 02:06:54.048]  The government's trying to drug the population and enslave them.
[02:06:54.068 --> 02:06:58.830]  The government's got these zealots working for them that will do the most evil things you can imagine because they think it's for the good.
[02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:00.451]  Of course, they find out it isn't.
[02:07:00.911 --> 02:07:02.351]  And that's just a repeat of history.
[02:07:03.632 --> 02:07:06.053]  So you've got two different types of people, but you have that variant.
[02:07:06.453 --> 02:07:08.794]  So many well-meaning, good people dedicated.
[02:07:10.695 --> 02:07:16.498]  I mean, I don't look down on Pat Tillman charging machine gun nests.
[02:07:17.955 --> 02:07:20.517]  Or what he thought were machine gun nests had been shot by his own men.
[02:07:20.537 --> 02:07:22.878]  I mean, he was fooled.
[02:07:22.918 --> 02:07:23.718]  He was conned.
[02:07:24.039 --> 02:07:28.281]  He gave up, what, $2 million, $3 million a year to run off and join.
[02:07:29.582 --> 02:07:37.907]  And then he found out it was run by a bunch of scammers and that the officers weren't doing their jobs and were basically sitting back at the base with laptop computers.
[02:07:38.267 --> 02:07:42.269]  And he got killed and got turned into this big martyr, and it turned out it was all lies.
[02:07:42.309 --> 02:07:44.110]  But I still can't look down on Pat Tillman.
[02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:45.951]  You know, he believed in something greater.
[02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:47.232]  He was being conned.
[02:07:47.970 --> 02:07:52.252]  He was being manipulated by the New World Order, but his heart was in the right place, folks.
[02:07:52.992 --> 02:07:54.733]  Pat Tillman's heart was in the right place.
[02:07:55.333 --> 02:07:56.814]  He was a focused, professional person.
[02:07:56.834 --> 02:07:58.295]  He didn't want to go kill people.
[02:07:58.335 --> 02:07:59.575]  He wanted to go defend his brother.
[02:08:00.196 --> 02:08:03.958]  He wanted to go stand up against who he thought had attacked his country.
[02:08:04.298 --> 02:08:05.238]  He was a real man.
[02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:10.413]  Being a man isn't enough.
[02:08:10.493 --> 02:08:26.028]  You've got to have brains with the courage, brains with the brawn, enough to make sure that your charity, your commitment, your sacrifice, your dedication isn't being squandered, isn't being used for something bad.
[02:08:26.389 --> 02:08:27.530]  And most certainly it was.
[02:08:31.494 --> 02:08:33.435]  Colonels, generals have gone on record.
[02:08:33.775 --> 02:08:38.898]  And boy, they'll be in one San Francisco Chronicle article or one AP article, and then you never hear of them again.
[02:08:39.198 --> 02:08:40.118]  They refuse to torture.
[02:08:40.138 --> 02:08:40.899]  They get fired.
[02:08:41.019 --> 02:08:41.699]  They get removed.
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:48.402]  They go, we had all the top Taliban generals in custody in Al-Qaeda, and we're ordered to release them because they were CIA.
[02:08:48.723 --> 02:08:49.743]  You never hear that again.
[02:08:49.763 --> 02:08:52.925]  And we know Tillman was complaining.
[02:08:52.945 --> 02:08:56.807]  I mean, Tillman didn't know.
[02:08:56.827 --> 02:08:57.607]  It's like General...
[02:08:58.382 --> 02:08:59.623]  Herpinski we had on yesterday.
[02:08:59.643 --> 02:09:00.944]  She goes, I thought we were the good guys.
[02:09:01.244 --> 02:09:02.365]  I always believed in the system.
[02:09:02.445 --> 02:09:03.446]  I didn't know all this.
[02:09:04.567 --> 02:09:06.328]  And by the way, I don't just go off what she says.
[02:09:06.428 --> 02:09:07.629]  I know her story's true.
[02:09:08.070 --> 02:09:09.451]  It's all public in the documents.
[02:09:10.612 --> 02:09:15.356]  She wasn't allowed into those wings in those 17, now 32 camps where all the torture went on.
[02:09:15.536 --> 02:09:17.497]  That was all military intelligence and CIA.
[02:09:17.657 --> 02:09:18.638]  Just like Camp X-Ray.
[02:09:18.918 --> 02:09:23.202]  They can give the Red Cross a tour of most of the base because most of the base is where the torture's going on.
[02:09:23.382 --> 02:09:24.503]  But they're not allowed into that 20% CIA run.
[02:09:26.863 --> 02:09:28.003]  And they tried to burn her.
[02:09:28.503 --> 02:09:29.524]  She wouldn't go along with it.
[02:09:31.104 --> 02:09:32.044]  And she didn't get it.
[02:09:32.124 --> 02:09:32.885]  Now she gets it.
[02:09:32.925 --> 02:09:34.065]  Now she knows they're criminal.
[02:09:34.305 --> 02:09:35.625]  Now she came on air and said it.
[02:09:35.826 --> 02:09:39.627]  Now she says they're creating terror squads or torture squads.
[02:09:41.267 --> 02:09:42.327]  Same thing with Ray McGovern.
[02:09:42.367 --> 02:09:43.488]  He thought the government was good.
[02:09:43.528 --> 02:09:44.608]  He didn't know it was pure evil.
[02:09:44.628 --> 02:09:46.448]  He believed the whole lie about globalism.
[02:09:48.029 --> 02:09:50.810]  Ronald Reagan's chief advisor for, what, six years?
[02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:52.210]  From 82 to 88.
[02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:55.331]  Then four years with George Bush Sr.,
[02:09:56.565 --> 02:09:59.266]  Saying the government may carry out terror.
[02:09:59.286 --> 02:09:59.946]  Do you understand?
[02:10:00.646 --> 02:10:11.809]  Ray McGovern, number five in the CIA, folks, saying our government may carry out terror attacks to blame it on foreign enemies as a smokescreen.
[02:10:12.729 --> 02:10:18.130]  And the declassified tapes come out of Nixon talking about starting nuclear wars to stay in office.
[02:10:19.153 --> 02:10:20.793]  The LBJ tape is released.
[02:10:20.833 --> 02:10:22.154]  Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[02:10:22.494 --> 02:10:22.934]  Staged.
[02:10:23.434 --> 02:10:24.254]  USS Liberty.
[02:10:24.334 --> 02:10:26.315]  I've had the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff on.
[02:10:27.395 --> 02:10:28.115]  Admiral Moore.
[02:10:28.855 --> 02:10:30.216]  I've had the other admirals on.
[02:10:30.276 --> 02:10:37.978]  I've had the admirals on this show that took the phone call on their ship, the radio phone call, with LBJ going, I don't care.
[02:10:38.018 --> 02:10:39.738]  You turn that squadron back.
[02:10:40.138 --> 02:10:43.679]  I want that GD ship going to the bottom, soldier!
[02:10:43.979 --> 02:10:46.540]  Do I need to relieve you right now?
[02:10:49.324 --> 02:10:51.626]  I want our sailors dead!
[02:10:51.666 --> 02:10:54.589]  The actual quote is, I want that GD boat going to the bottom.
[02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:56.370]  Now, do I have to relieve you, soldier?
[02:11:00.153 --> 02:11:00.934]  Think about that.
[02:11:03.156 --> 02:11:06.139]  LBJ, a month before, takes control of the ship, the USS Liberty.
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:11.743]  They park it 14 miles off the coast of Israel and Syria, Lebanon.
[02:11:13.045 --> 02:11:14.326]  They got it right off the coast.
[02:11:16.267 --> 02:11:16.908]  All of a sudden...
[02:11:18.261 --> 02:11:21.462]  Multiple squadrons of fighter bombers come in and start bombing.
[02:11:21.702 --> 02:11:23.443]  Torpedo boats start attacking.
[02:11:24.703 --> 02:11:25.903]  Scraping and attacking.
[02:11:26.023 --> 02:11:28.424]  800 and something cannon holes.
[02:11:28.444 --> 02:11:30.345]  A giant 30 foot torpedo hole.
[02:11:31.505 --> 02:11:33.266]  Thousands of .50 caliber holes.
[02:11:33.426 --> 02:11:35.606]  Burning white phosphorus bombs all over the deck.
[02:11:36.126 --> 02:11:38.347]  Literally the captain with his intestines hanging out.
[02:11:38.607 --> 02:11:39.748]  With his guts tied in.
[02:11:41.108 --> 02:11:41.948]  We've had him on.
[02:11:43.389 --> 02:11:45.789]  We've had them all on over the years.
[02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:47.570]  McGonagall's dead now.
[02:11:49.787 --> 02:11:53.689]  I mean, imagine, I've had the Admiral on, folks, who took the phone call from the President.
[02:11:53.849 --> 02:12:00.172]  I've had the Admiral on, telling you the President said, I want that boat going to the bottom!
[02:12:01.953 --> 02:12:05.294]  Imagine taking a boat out there, most highly decorated U.S.
[02:12:05.334 --> 02:12:05.994]  ship in U.S.
[02:12:06.014 --> 02:12:06.235]  history.
[02:12:06.755 --> 02:12:09.096]  That's in 230-something years.
[02:12:13.638 --> 02:12:18.000]  I mean, not even Jones, back in the Navy, John Paul Jones,
[02:12:19.614 --> 02:12:25.998]  Back in 1776 had a record like that.
[02:12:27.259 --> 02:12:27.719]  Innocent.
[02:12:27.779 --> 02:12:29.600]  And they gave him their Congressional Medal of Honor.
[02:12:30.441 --> 02:12:31.562]  Gave it to him in secret.
[02:12:31.962 --> 02:12:36.985]  Told him, you'll be put in prison for life or killed if you tell anybody what you know.
[02:12:39.046 --> 02:12:43.389]  And imagine McNamara is on the radio saying, no, turn the planes back.
[02:12:44.410 --> 02:12:44.990]  No, you're not.
[02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:46.151]  And the admirals are...
[02:12:46.821 --> 02:12:52.284]  Still sending the jets as it's being attacked to intercept and defend that.
[02:12:52.985 --> 02:12:57.107]  And our government knew right when they got on the phone, they go, let Israel do what they're doing.
[02:12:57.407 --> 02:12:58.128]  It was a setup.
[02:12:58.208 --> 02:12:59.369]  Our government sticks it out there.
[02:12:59.609 --> 02:13:00.309]  They come attack.
[02:13:00.569 --> 02:13:01.490]  It was to be blamed.
[02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:04.752]  This is admitted on Egypt and start World War III, 1967.
[02:13:09.275 --> 02:13:11.457]  1967.
[02:13:09.376 --> 02:13:11.457]  Imagine the cold-bloodedness.
[02:13:11.757 --> 02:13:13.099]  Our men had done nothing.
[02:13:13.259 --> 02:13:15.480]  And I'm talking to our military and our cops right now.
[02:13:15.821 --> 02:13:19.904]  If you don't think they won't flush you down the toilet like they did those men, got another thing coming.
[02:13:20.104 --> 02:13:31.553]  If you don't join us and get your heads out of the sand and stop playing games with yourself and stop denying, and if you don't have the courage to admit what's happening, then you've just sold your country out.
[02:13:31.974 --> 02:13:33.915]  I mean, how many examples of this do I have to give you?
[02:13:33.995 --> 02:13:34.896]  I've given you hundreds.
[02:13:35.617 --> 02:13:37.278]  It's an orgy of evidence, as we say.
[02:13:39.187 --> 02:13:40.008]  I'm tired of it.
[02:13:41.449 --> 02:13:46.413]  Imagine the nerve of LBJ to get on that phone and tell that admiral, I want them dead.
[02:13:46.593 --> 02:13:48.034]  I want that ship going to the bottom.
[02:13:51.216 --> 02:13:53.678]  Think about that.
[02:13:53.718 --> 02:13:54.739]  Do you know what?
[02:13:54.799 --> 02:13:56.841]  God, through those men, kept that ship afloat.
[02:13:56.881 --> 02:13:57.681]  They didn't get away with it.
[02:13:58.202 --> 02:13:58.542]  You see?
[02:13:59.563 --> 02:14:00.984]  We do have providence on our side.
[02:14:02.476 --> 02:14:03.777]  Strafing the lifeboats.
[02:14:04.057 --> 02:14:04.717]  Totally illegal.
[02:14:05.057 --> 02:14:05.337]  U.S.
[02:14:05.397 --> 02:14:08.179]  ship, well-known, flying an unusually large U.S.
[02:14:08.219 --> 02:14:08.599]  flag.
[02:14:08.619 --> 02:14:15.462]  And they've even interviewed some of the Israeli pilots who have cried about it in interviews and said, yes, three times I said, that's an American ship.
[02:14:15.822 --> 02:14:16.262]  Attack.
[02:14:16.362 --> 02:14:16.883]  Engage.
[02:14:17.703 --> 02:14:18.563]  That's an American ship.
[02:14:18.703 --> 02:14:19.084]  Attack.
[02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:19.704]  Engage.
[02:14:20.164 --> 02:14:21.024]  That's an American ship.
[02:14:22.165 --> 02:14:23.466]  That is a direct order.
[02:14:23.646 --> 02:14:25.246]  Attack that ship.
[02:14:27.427 --> 02:14:28.768]  They wanted no survivors.
[02:14:29.491 --> 02:14:31.491]  They were to scrape and kill every survivor.
[02:14:31.511 --> 02:14:34.512]  They even sent in Israeli commandos on helicopters.
[02:14:35.132 --> 02:14:40.934]  They were to kill every single sailor and marine on board that ship.
[02:14:42.214 --> 02:14:44.234]  Every single one of them.
[02:14:44.454 --> 02:14:45.935]  To blame it on the Egyptians.
[02:14:47.715 --> 02:14:50.276]  And I know, to graduate, they have Delta Force members now.
[02:14:50.556 --> 02:14:51.816]  Reed Machiavelli's the prince.
[02:14:53.331 --> 02:14:58.213]  And if you don't agree with it, the end justifies the means, you don't get your stripes now.
[02:14:58.633 --> 02:15:00.253]  You don't get to join the squadron.
[02:15:00.273 --> 02:15:00.814]  Did you know that?
[02:15:03.134 --> 02:15:06.255]  Yeah, that's how they make sure you're a sociopath sicko.
[02:15:08.496 --> 02:15:21.000]  So let me tell people who might become Delta Force or into the higher level SEAL teams or into the secret squadrons above those groups, if you really want to be good and get into the inside, yeah, go ahead and say you'll do whatever.
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:22.741]  Go ahead and say you'll do evil things.
[02:15:23.763 --> 02:15:28.725]  So you can get inside and really see what I'm talking about for your own little beady eyes.
[02:15:31.126 --> 02:15:32.166]  Because you fail.
[02:15:32.746 --> 02:15:34.847]  You don't tell them you won't do those immoral things.
[02:15:35.107 --> 02:15:37.108]  You don't get the Machiavellian politics.
[02:15:37.368 --> 02:15:45.370]  Because, see, the argument is, well, we've got to do something for America, and we've got to go to war with the Soviets, and we've got to start World War III in the Middle East.
[02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:51.653]  So if 137 sailors have got to die, we've got to break eggs and make an omelet.
[02:15:51.673 --> 02:15:52.553]  Collateral damage.
[02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:59.475]  Americans have never behaved like that, and shame on you if you try to adopt that psychology.
[02:15:59.835 --> 02:16:03.437]  What is your major malfunction, scumbag?
[02:16:05.117 --> 02:16:06.498]  What is wrong with you?
[02:16:06.518 --> 02:16:19.784]  Of course, LBJ started having heart attacks after that, and God had a way of dealing with him, and he just ended up being a little sissy up there with his knees knocking, crying on TV, begging, I'm sorry for what I did.
[02:16:20.104 --> 02:16:20.505]  And you know what?
[02:16:20.545 --> 02:16:21.225]  At least he did.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:25.722]  In the end, I think we'll see hell's mouth opening up for him.
[02:16:26.122 --> 02:16:28.023]  He was pretty freaked out there the last few years.
[02:16:28.503 --> 02:16:29.364]  Good!
[02:16:30.504 --> 02:16:33.806]  Good, LBJ, you evil person.
[02:16:35.727 --> 02:16:36.287]  I'm glad.
[02:16:36.307 --> 02:16:39.809]  Because you've killed a lot of people.
[02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:43.291]  And I'm sick of people like you.
[02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:44.871]  I'm tired of people like you.
[02:16:46.132 --> 02:16:47.253]  Hell awaits you.
[02:16:48.393 --> 02:16:49.013]  Know that.
[02:16:49.094 --> 02:16:49.954]  Understand that.
[02:16:51.112 --> 02:16:51.912]  This is real.
[02:16:53.072 --> 02:16:57.794]  So you're out there, you're a cop, you're in special forces, you're a whatever you are, you're an FBI agent.
[02:16:58.314 --> 02:16:59.754]  Go look up what I said about the Liberty.
[02:16:59.774 --> 02:17:07.016]  Go listen to the interviews with the admirals and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the captain and the first mate and the doctor.
[02:17:07.536 --> 02:17:08.776]  Go listen to all the interviews.
[02:17:09.376 --> 02:17:10.137]  Go listen to it.
[02:17:10.357 --> 02:17:15.698]  You go listen to the people that took the phone call to kill our own men!
[02:17:16.713 --> 02:17:18.054]  What's wrong, you Serbs?
[02:17:18.274 --> 02:17:19.676]  This is not your government.
[02:17:19.876 --> 02:17:21.617]  It hasn't been for a long time.
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.782]  Listen, they tell you to go get your vaccinations.
[02:17:26.842 --> 02:17:28.983]  They put the stuff in the same vaccine they give us.
[02:17:29.264 --> 02:17:30.184]  They give it to you.
[02:17:30.985 --> 02:17:32.026]  We're your friends.
[02:17:33.187 --> 02:17:34.388]  We're the Americans.
[02:17:35.229 --> 02:17:36.250]  We're the good guys.
[02:17:37.631 --> 02:17:42.195]  Now, break your conditioning right now and join humanity.
[02:17:42.535 --> 02:17:43.596]  Put the white hat on.
[02:17:47.193 --> 02:17:48.795]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:17:49.355 --> 02:17:50.676]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:17:51.117 --> 02:17:53.799]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:17:54.259 --> 02:17:56.902]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:17:57.362 --> 02:18:03.808]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:18:04.008 --> 02:18:04.769]  We're good to go.
[02:18:24.649 --> 02:18:26.111]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:18:26.271 --> 02:18:26.591]  Have you?
[02:18:27.192 --> 02:18:28.713]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:18:29.154 --> 02:18:32.897]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:18:32.917 --> 02:18:36.921]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:18:37.381 --> 02:18:38.422]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:18:38.983 --> 02:18:40.184]  Osama bin forgotten.
[02:18:40.604 --> 02:18:44.248]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:18:47.617 --> 02:18:48.659]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:48.979 --> 02:18:51.783]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:52.044 --> 02:18:56.210]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.630 --> 02:18:57.451]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.772 --> 02:19:02.339]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.819 --> 02:19:04.960]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:20.126]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:20.166 --> 02:19:27.229]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:31.993]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:19:32.433 --> 02:19:34.595]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:34.735 --> 02:19:35.276]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:19:35.316 --> 02:19:36.737]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:19:36.757 --> 02:19:38.038]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[02:19:38.058 --> 02:19:38.559]  One and the same.
[02:19:55.313 --> 02:20:05.160]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:08.703]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:08.963 --> 02:20:10.804]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:11.044 --> 02:20:13.886]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:14.427 --> 02:20:16.648]  Here is reality.
[02:20:17.028 --> 02:20:20.591]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:21.091 --> 02:20:24.694]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:25.299 --> 02:20:29.044]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:20:29.465 --> 02:20:33.210]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:20:33.550 --> 02:20:35.052]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:35.072 --> 02:20:35.313]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.038 --> 02:20:49.479]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:20:49.699 --> 02:20:53.622]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:20:53.902 --> 02:21:01.227]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste spill is something we all face every day.
[02:21:01.507 --> 02:21:03.408]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[02:21:03.728 --> 02:21:10.513]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:21:10.833 --> 02:21:13.735]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[02:21:13.995 --> 02:21:16.637]  Your Nuke Alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area...
[02:21:16.897 --> 02:21:17.077]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:21:17.097 --> 02:21:18.317]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear today.
[02:21:18.397 --> 02:21:20.278]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:21:20.298 --> 02:21:24.639]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:21:24.659 --> 02:21:24.879]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:21:24.919 --> 02:21:26.599]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear today.
[02:21:26.619 --> 02:21:27.079]  Nuclear.
[02:21:27.099 --> 02:21:28.480]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:21:45.549 --> 02:21:46.610]  We're good to go.
[02:22:16.252 --> 02:22:18.434]  On horrible days like 9-11.
[02:22:19.194 --> 02:22:20.455]  Government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:22:20.715 --> 02:22:21.496]  Totally documented.
[02:22:22.276 --> 02:22:26.239]  And it grows from there into biological plagues and nukes going off.
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:29.602]  The sins justifies the means business.
[02:22:29.622 --> 02:22:34.405]  These are a bunch of inbred, psychopathic, former cokehead scumbags running all this.
[02:22:35.285 --> 02:22:37.627]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[02:22:37.647 --> 02:22:40.889]  And you can sit there and make little excuses and make little jokes about it.
[02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:42.150]  You don't love your family.
[02:22:42.571 --> 02:22:43.091]  It's that simple.
[02:22:43.709 --> 02:22:46.230]  Let's talk to Jim in Boston, then Paula, Joe, and others.
[02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:46.911]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:22:47.511 --> 02:22:48.512]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:22:48.552 --> 02:22:48.752]  Good.
[02:22:49.552 --> 02:22:53.094]  Hey, I just have a comment about last night.
[02:22:55.055 --> 02:23:02.339]  I saw on NBC News where they showed the video of the explosions, the three explosions in front of the...
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:04.781]  The hotel down in Baghdad?
[02:23:04.901 --> 02:23:05.441]  Baghdad?
[02:23:06.021 --> 02:23:06.761]  Yeah, right.
[02:23:06.821 --> 02:23:09.342]  Yeah, the terrorists are attacking the media.
[02:23:09.803 --> 02:23:14.224]  Sure, but usually it's our own military doing it, but now Al-Qaeda's helping out.
[02:23:14.664 --> 02:23:23.208]  Oh, yeah, it's... I looked at it from all different angles, and I believe it is definitely staged.
[02:23:23.308 --> 02:23:26.749]  I mean, how could they... I mean, first of all,
[02:23:30.029 --> 02:23:33.531]  Well, especially the one cement mixer truck.
[02:23:34.191 --> 02:23:37.153]  I mean, they had to have that all set.
[02:23:37.173 --> 02:23:40.195]  This whole thing probably was planned weeks in advance.
[02:23:40.755 --> 02:23:45.938]  I mean, to load these big trucks full of high-to-the-hills with explosives.
[02:23:46.538 --> 02:23:48.619]  I mean, this whole thing was virtually staged.
[02:23:49.259 --> 02:23:53.642]  Staged not only for the media, but staged for the whole world to see.
[02:23:54.497 --> 02:23:57.298]  It's just plain pure and simple.
[02:23:57.318 --> 02:23:59.058]  Yeah, we need to write an article about that.
[02:23:59.098 --> 02:23:59.898]  Thanks for the call.
[02:23:59.938 --> 02:24:02.539]  We all kind of get desensitized to it.
[02:24:03.519 --> 02:24:06.880]  We know the Pentagon said before the war they were going to target journalists.
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:14.742]  And then they brought the troops into the Baghdad Hotel, and they didn't like what Reuters was reporting, so they opened fire on the ninth floor and killed a bunch of people.
[02:24:14.762 --> 02:24:18.423]  And then I hear people on air going, Oh, we've got to let our troops defend themselves.
[02:24:19.383 --> 02:24:20.243]  Killing journalists?
[02:24:20.323 --> 02:24:20.563]  What?
[02:24:21.384 --> 02:24:23.164]  We've even had troops in New Orleans.
[02:24:24.096 --> 02:24:33.002]  March up to our press and say, hey, we killed press in Iraq for reporting on stuff, and we'll kill you.
[02:24:33.602 --> 02:24:35.243]  I'll shoot you.
[02:24:35.303 --> 02:24:37.365]  Officers telling the whole groups of press this.
[02:24:38.145 --> 02:24:38.966]  That's been in the news.
[02:24:41.034 --> 02:24:41.794]  And it's horrible.
[02:24:42.014 --> 02:24:48.116]  And we've caught the British dressed up like Muslims with fake beards running around shooting people with cars full of plastic explosives.
[02:24:48.576 --> 02:24:49.977]  We've caught the Israelis doing it.
[02:24:50.037 --> 02:24:51.317]  We've caught our own government doing it.
[02:24:51.857 --> 02:24:54.458]  And a lot of these bombings are orchestrated by our government.
[02:24:54.918 --> 02:24:57.899]  It's like, you know, people who are aid activists against the occupation.
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:09.823]  It's in mainstream papers that coalition governments seen grabbing her and white guys seen grabbing her and then, you know, they dress up like terrorists in black masks and blow her head off and then
[02:25:10.758 --> 02:25:13.300]  And, you know, this is how we deal with people.
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:15.681]  Al-Qaeda is killing everyone that's against Bush.
[02:25:16.862 --> 02:25:18.382]  Well, I guess they always do, don't they?
[02:25:18.402 --> 02:25:21.024]  I mean, it's just, it's so ridiculous.
[02:25:22.125 --> 02:25:25.887]  And, yeah, a whole bunch of these big bombs go off and kill a bunch of media.
[02:25:26.967 --> 02:25:28.148]  Just get out, media.
[02:25:28.228 --> 02:25:29.829]  We don't want you here seeing what's happening.
[02:25:31.932 --> 02:25:37.013]  Our own government admittedly carried out a lot of terrorism in Vietnam to blame it on the communists.
[02:25:37.053 --> 02:25:38.433]  Again, I'm no fan of the communists.
[02:25:38.853 --> 02:25:40.854]  It's just the communists that pull the same kind of stuff.
[02:25:41.634 --> 02:25:42.314]  So that's the argument.
[02:25:42.354 --> 02:25:43.774]  Well, they're doing it, so we better do it.
[02:25:44.094 --> 02:25:47.115]  You know, it just turns into this nightmare situation.
[02:25:47.575 --> 02:25:48.655]  Paula in Florida.
[02:25:48.675 --> 02:25:49.315]  Go ahead, Paula.
[02:25:49.515 --> 02:25:51.216]  Hey, Alex, and good morning, hon.
[02:25:51.836 --> 02:25:53.136]  You're right about everything.
[02:25:53.896 --> 02:25:59.357]  And, you know, the sad part about this is that our president sitting in this office is from the House of David.
[02:25:59.853 --> 02:26:02.915]  And the House of David is part of the New World Order, so is the Catholic Church.
[02:26:03.936 --> 02:26:05.618]  And I tell you, it's sickening.
[02:26:06.538 --> 02:26:08.180]  What do you mean, the House of David?
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.122]  GW descends from the Holy Family.
[02:26:12.423 --> 02:26:13.103]  Just like I do.
[02:26:13.844 --> 02:26:14.624]  Just like you do, huh?
[02:26:14.965 --> 02:26:16.046]  Yeah, my husband does, too.
[02:26:16.146 --> 02:26:20.969]  Anyway, LBJ, what you were saying about him, he was part of the New World Order, too.
[02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:22.010]  I mean, they all have been.
[02:26:22.050 --> 02:26:23.932]  We've been in the New World Order since the 1700s.
[02:26:25.173 --> 02:26:26.494]  People don't even realize it, but...
[02:26:27.618 --> 02:26:30.020]  Well, you know, I'm just a commoner myself.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:33.702]  I don't descend from the Supreme Family or whatever.
[02:26:35.303 --> 02:26:37.084]  Well, I tell you, that's what makes it so sickening.
[02:26:37.364 --> 02:26:39.505]  So are you a Merovingian?
[02:26:40.346 --> 02:26:40.526]  Yeah.
[02:26:41.427 --> 02:26:41.907]  You are.
[02:26:42.748 --> 02:26:48.111]  But anyway, the thing is, you're right on the money, honey, and God's going to bless you for what you're doing.
[02:26:49.091 --> 02:26:50.312]  And he sent you.
[02:26:50.532 --> 02:26:50.933]  I know that.
[02:26:52.213 --> 02:26:54.755]  And you just keep up the wonderful work that you're doing.
[02:26:55.786 --> 02:26:58.067]  And you'll be blessed, hon, more than you'll ever know.
[02:26:58.347 --> 02:26:59.427]  Well, thank you for the call.
[02:26:59.507 --> 02:27:00.888]  I really appreciate that.
[02:27:01.788 --> 02:27:04.349]  Anytime somebody prays for me, I appreciate it.
[02:27:07.350 --> 02:27:08.370]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:27:08.390 --> 02:27:10.911]  We'll talk to Joe, and I think what's up after that.
[02:27:11.331 --> 02:27:12.211]  What's up, Doc?
[02:27:12.291 --> 02:27:14.652]  Linda in California and others.
[02:27:14.672 --> 02:27:15.452]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:15.512 --> 02:27:20.574]  I'm going to cover some news when we get back, then we'll get to your other calls.
[02:27:22.415 --> 02:27:24.976]  I'm going to just try to bang through them as quickly as possible.
[02:27:24.996 --> 02:27:25.716]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:25.936 --> 02:27:34.119]  But, yeah, I did see that footage, and it was pretty staged.
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:37.220]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:39.341]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.261 --> 02:27:42.942]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.474 --> 02:27:52.838]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.038 --> 02:27:58.042]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.382 --> 02:28:06.287]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.447 --> 02:28:13.492]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.692 --> 02:28:14.914]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:15.054 --> 02:28:18.459]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.519 --> 02:28:19.620]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.921 --> 02:28:21.183]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.403 --> 02:28:28.232]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:28.352 --> 02:28:30.816]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:30.956 --> 02:28:33.898]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[02:28:33.918 --> 02:28:33.958]  866-885-6625.
[02:28:33.978 --> 02:28:34.939]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.007 --> 02:28:50.632]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:28:50.832 --> 02:28:55.276]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:28:55.457 --> 02:29:09.471]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:29:09.691 --> 02:29:12.312]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[02:29:12.332 --> 02:29:13.392]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[02:29:13.432 --> 02:29:14.793]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:29:38.382 --> 02:29:42.125]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:42.726 --> 02:29:44.607]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:46.489 --> 02:29:49.291]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:29:49.391 --> 02:29:54.476]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:29:54.696 --> 02:30:00.881]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:30:01.141 --> 02:30:06.726]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:30:07.046 --> 02:30:12.548]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:30:12.788 --> 02:30:16.630]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:30:16.650 --> 02:30:21.912]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:30:22.112 --> 02:30:22.292]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:22.312 --> 02:30:23.293]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[02:30:28.915 --> 02:30:33.096]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[02:30:33.316 --> 02:30:36.257]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[02:30:36.277 --> 02:30:41.298]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[02:30:41.538 --> 02:30:43.958]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:54.640]  All right, we're going to take the gamut of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:58.348 --> 02:31:00.209]  On this live Tuesday edition.
[02:31:01.210 --> 02:31:05.553]  But let me get into some news here that's pretty important.
[02:31:05.573 --> 02:31:08.716]  Before I do that, just one more plug today.
[02:31:09.456 --> 02:31:12.418]  I'm going to have one final showing.
[02:31:12.458 --> 02:31:23.006]  We had two overflow sellout showings at the Alamo Draft House downtown at the Alamo in South Lamar a few weeks ago of an early version of the Order of Death.
[02:31:24.667 --> 02:31:25.548]  It was a screening.
[02:31:26.113 --> 02:31:33.117]  And it was 40 minutes at that time, and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove had been cut down to an hour and 45 minutes.
[02:31:33.617 --> 02:31:45.064]  Well, I've cut Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove down to an hour and 30 minutes, and I've increased the length and added a lot of new documents and video clips for the Order of Death, and these are great videos.
[02:31:47.806 --> 02:31:53.349]  We're going to be showing the final completed version coming up this...
[02:31:54.153 --> 02:32:00.555]  Thursday, 7 o'clock, one final showing at the Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar.
[02:32:01.596 --> 02:32:03.416]  And when we show this, that's it.
[02:32:04.317 --> 02:32:09.999]  It then goes to the DVD duplicators so we can start offering this to the listeners.
[02:32:10.099 --> 02:32:12.800]  But have a chance to see it before anybody else sees it.
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.521]  This is the final version of both films.
[02:32:16.121 --> 02:32:17.722]  They'll both be together on one DVD.
[02:32:19.133 --> 02:32:19.873]  And that's coming up.
[02:32:19.953 --> 02:32:31.618]  So go to infowars.com to link through to the safe, secure online shopping cart over at the Alamo Draft House to get your tickets online before they sell out.
[02:32:31.718 --> 02:32:39.461]  Or if you're driving around Austin, pull into the Alamo Draft House South Lamar and get your tickets for the event there as well.
[02:32:40.602 --> 02:32:46.404]  Coming up the 27th, this Thursday, 7 o'clock.
[02:32:48.098 --> 02:32:48.718]  And I'll be there.
[02:32:48.738 --> 02:32:51.639]  I'll give a speech beforehand, have a question and answer after.
[02:32:51.659 --> 02:32:57.301]  I'll also have all my books and videos and t-shirts there in case any of you want to drop by and get it there.
[02:33:00.321 --> 02:33:13.145]  And incidentally, in about two weeks, we will no longer offer the original VHS two-hour, five-minute long Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:33:14.136 --> 02:33:34.425]  We've updated it, we've cut a lot out, we've added some information, we've made it faster moving, and this will sort of wake up the general public out there, but if you want the original that we made five years ago, in about three weeks after we got out, and we turned it out quick, but it's a good video, and I'm signing every copy that goes out until we quit offering it,
[02:33:35.409 --> 02:33:43.255]  Then you can go to infowars.com and order the original Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:33:43.735 --> 02:33:47.458]  And you'll get the two-hour, five-minute film, the signed edition.
[02:33:48.299 --> 02:33:50.220]  Or you can also call toll-free to get it, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:57.515 --> 02:34:02.939]  That's 888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:18.374 --> 02:34:21.416]  And then you can also go to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:34:21.456 --> 02:34:31.144]  We will leave the original version up there for prisonplanet.tv members, along with a new version of Dark Secrets and, of course, the new film, The Order of Death, that is just amazing.
[02:34:31.184 --> 02:34:32.505]  It's an excellent video.
[02:34:33.485 --> 02:34:34.446]  My 13th film.
[02:34:36.167 --> 02:34:47.676]  And also, we're carrying a new book, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, full of documents, photos, just a quick read, an excellent read, a great way to wake people up about world government.
[02:34:48.536 --> 02:34:54.601]  There is just so much information in this book, and it's so professionally done by Jim Tucker.
[02:34:55.883 --> 02:35:06.532]  Over a quarter century covering this high-level globalist organization, this cabal, that's available at Infowars.com or by writing to us or by calling the toll-free number.
[02:35:07.634 --> 02:35:17.799]  And then there's all those other videos, like JPFO's Innocence Portrayed Second Amendment video that comes with three free color booklets, Grandpa Jack, booklets about the history of gun control.
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:20.000]  Great to wake up gun control fanatics.
[02:35:21.621 --> 02:35:23.922]  We also have the Everything Else special.
[02:35:24.303 --> 02:35:28.745]  Every video and book we carry together at a massive discount.
[02:35:30.246 --> 02:35:34.468]  We also, on top of that, have the new three DVD specials.
[02:35:35.633 --> 02:35:37.515]  Where are my three newest DVDs?
[02:35:37.535 --> 02:35:42.118]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or I should say my most important DVDs.
[02:35:42.138 --> 02:35:45.981]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, American Dictators, and Martial Law.
[02:35:46.461 --> 02:35:49.383]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[02:35:49.984 --> 02:35:53.826]  About seven and a half hours of video for $44.95.
[02:35:56.966 --> 02:35:59.187]  Normally it would be $75, folks.
[02:35:59.487 --> 02:36:02.147]  And I'm only doing this until the new year.
[02:36:02.487 --> 02:36:06.228]  These super specials, the other good specials are there too.
[02:36:06.268 --> 02:36:07.488]  We have some really good specials.
[02:36:08.048 --> 02:36:14.470]  Those are going to stay, but these insane specials, it's like the ad where, come down to my mattress shop, it's insane!
[02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:15.790]  Insane deals!
[02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:19.371]  But I mean, literally I could be doing that, folks, and it wouldn't be a stretch.
[02:36:20.422 --> 02:36:24.485]  We have slash, slash, slash, because I just want to get this out to people.
[02:36:24.505 --> 02:36:34.832]  So go to InfoWars.com and order via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Card or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:36:35.112 --> 02:36:40.836]  And when you do that, you're supporting this broadcast of what we do and the information we're putting out.
[02:36:42.677 --> 02:36:45.179]  And that's really what it is.
[02:36:46.624 --> 02:36:50.346]  In the final summation, it's supporting us and it's getting the word out.
[02:36:50.946 --> 02:36:56.408]  And these videos and books that we carry and the films I've made are very effective at waking people up.
[02:36:56.648 --> 02:36:57.529]  We have the truth.
[02:36:57.609 --> 02:36:58.569]  We have the initiative.
[02:36:59.569 --> 02:37:00.630]  And we have the motivation.
[02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:01.550]  We're being enslaved.
[02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:06.432]  So now is the time to stand up against this new world order.
[02:37:07.113 --> 02:37:10.494]  Now is the time to stand up against all this corruption.
[02:37:11.454 --> 02:37:12.815]  We've got to do it.
[02:37:13.495 --> 02:37:15.136]  And the videos get that job done.
[02:37:16.385 --> 02:37:22.226]  Well, they're now saying that the source of the leak is Dick Cheney, so will he get in trouble?
[02:37:22.946 --> 02:37:24.027]  We can hold our breath.
[02:37:24.047 --> 02:37:26.267]  We've only got a few days to wait.
[02:37:26.347 --> 02:37:30.468]  The grand jury tenure ends in three days.
[02:37:30.488 --> 02:37:32.768]  It ends Friday at noon.
[02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:40.670]  They were going to release the information, the indictments, two weeks ago, but it's admitted that threatening phone calls were made by Karl Rove and others.
[02:37:40.690 --> 02:37:41.350]  That's been in the news.
[02:37:42.066 --> 02:37:43.748]  And things are on hold right now.
[02:37:44.229 --> 02:37:45.551]  So who knows what's going to happen.
[02:37:45.571 --> 02:37:50.457]  But remember, Bush and his minions are just puppets, titular heads, figureheads.
[02:37:51.192 --> 02:37:55.455]  Another major Pentagon espionage scandal brewing by Wayne Madison, who worked for the NSA.
[02:37:55.815 --> 02:37:57.156]  His info is always excellent.
[02:37:57.556 --> 02:38:01.359]  Another major espionage scandal brewing at the Pentagon, according to Pentagon insiders.
[02:38:01.839 --> 02:38:15.228]  The Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, has been the focus of another espionage investigation, as with the espionage scandal involving former DIA analyst Larry Franklin and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.
[02:38:15.629 --> 02:38:18.671]  The investigation of DIA has been plagued with...
[02:38:19.251 --> 02:38:25.597]  External political pressures because of the issue of possible dual loyalties of the principal suspects.
[02:38:26.137 --> 02:38:32.262]  In the case of Franklin, the investigation involves American citizens with close ties to Israel.
[02:38:32.663 --> 02:38:38.588]  In the other DIA matter, Chinese Americans are the prime suspects.
[02:38:39.268 --> 02:38:42.491]  The Department of Defense, Department of Justice, DIA, Defense Secretary...
[02:38:43.668 --> 02:39:00.718]  And Defense Security Service and the National Security Agency have all reportedly been involved in the cover-up and investigation into the penetration of DIA's critical counterterrorism elements, including able danger by at least one individual suspected of links to the Chinese or PRC intelligence.
[02:39:02.059 --> 02:39:04.620]  Well, I mean, America's been designed to fall.
[02:39:05.941 --> 02:39:12.485]  I mean, you go to the Pentagon, there are whole offices with known Chinese agents openly running things.
[02:39:13.363 --> 02:39:14.483]  But they're nothing.
[02:39:15.183 --> 02:39:19.404]  I mean, AIPAC literally controls central offices of the Pentagon.
[02:39:19.805 --> 02:39:27.406]  Known AIPAC members with dual citizenship, known Mossad and Shin Betta agents, openly sit in command positions.
[02:39:27.486 --> 02:39:32.167]  I mean, it's not like it's a... So any of this stuff is really just a joke.
[02:39:32.187 --> 02:39:37.148]  I mean, we have public admitted agents of Israel sitting in every power position.
[02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:39.729]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:39:40.859 --> 02:39:42.600]  This is out of the UK Inquirer.
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:43.681]  It's a serious article.
[02:39:43.721 --> 02:39:45.281]  It's not the National Inquirer, folks.
[02:39:45.301 --> 02:39:46.202]  It's the UK Inquirer.
[02:39:46.642 --> 02:39:48.623]  Universal soldier one step closer.
[02:39:49.123 --> 02:39:51.164]  Chips inserted into soldiers' brains.
[02:39:52.025 --> 02:39:53.646]  Boffins working for the U.S.
[02:39:53.686 --> 02:40:01.110]  military experimenting with creating super soldiers by sticking microchips in their brains.
[02:40:01.150 --> 02:40:05.432]  Apparently the Pentagon has decided that one of the things the soldiers are missing is brains.
[02:40:06.084 --> 02:40:09.166]  Or at least the ability to remember details of their training.
[02:40:09.607 --> 02:40:20.955]  Now researchers at the University of Southern California's Bioengineering Department have developed a chip which they claim acts in exactly the same way as the hippocampus.
[02:40:21.676 --> 02:40:29.742]  This is the part of the brain that deals with memory, and the chip can send out electrical signals similar to how it operates.
[02:40:29.822 --> 02:40:35.446]  So far, it worked well on rats, and it is hoped that one day experiments will be carried out on soldiers.
[02:40:36.064 --> 02:40:42.186]  Folks, the Pentagon openly says they want to do this, and they've already been making a lot of special forces take the chip.
[02:40:43.006 --> 02:40:43.866]  That is ongoing.
[02:40:44.246 --> 02:40:50.148]  There's a CBS News article that a listener sent me, and I appreciate this, and I hope my webmasters posted this.
[02:40:50.188 --> 02:40:53.489]  I ran out of the office before I'd seen that it indeed happened.
[02:40:54.289 --> 02:40:57.990]  But CBS News, public eye disarming Mike Wallace.
[02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:58.910]  It's an article about...
[02:41:02.495 --> 02:41:03.715]  Mike Wallace and his life.
[02:41:04.135 --> 02:41:13.417]  But in it, it's got this quote about how Justice John Roberts has joined the legions of people already convinced about gun control.
[02:41:15.558 --> 02:41:26.520]  It says, and he referenced, we assume, the relatively unknown position of gun control of Chief Justice John Roberts, calling him part of the legion of the already convinced.
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:28.981]  The article is actually about Mike Wallace at CBS.
[02:41:29.662 --> 02:41:32.544]  But it was the Roberts quote that jumped out at me.
[02:41:32.604 --> 02:41:33.565]  Well, thank you, Lester.
[02:41:33.585 --> 02:41:34.006]  You're right.
[02:41:34.726 --> 02:41:39.750]  And yeah, it's well known he's for gun control and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:41:40.471 --> 02:41:41.712]  Gay marriage things, all that.
[02:41:42.072 --> 02:41:43.173]  That's why it's conservative.
[02:41:43.753 --> 02:41:47.316]  Gun control, gay marriage, open borders, doubling the growth rate of government.
[02:41:47.416 --> 02:41:48.878]  It's conservative, folks.
[02:41:50.339 --> 02:41:51.860]  That's why I'm not a conservative.
[02:41:53.365 --> 02:41:56.487]  In the new paradigm, I'm a communist because I'm against communism.
[02:41:56.947 --> 02:42:00.769]  I'm a Nazi because I'm against Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says he admires Hitler.
[02:42:00.789 --> 02:42:03.171]  See, I'm against Hitler, so I'm for Hitler.
[02:42:04.251 --> 02:42:05.692]  Got to learn how all this works.
[02:42:05.812 --> 02:42:07.193]  And Roberts is wonderful.
[02:42:07.473 --> 02:42:11.456]  Of course, we now have Myers hopping about.
[02:42:11.956 --> 02:42:14.718]  And I told you, whoever they brought forward would be just like Gonzalez.
[02:42:15.078 --> 02:42:19.060]  Pro-torture, pro-open borders, pro-government, takeover of our lives.
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:20.301]  I mean, it's just part of the course.
[02:42:21.474 --> 02:42:23.614]  New bird flu cases in Europe and Russia.
[02:42:23.634 --> 02:42:30.456]  They have confirmed a vicious parrot, being sarcastic, in England.
[02:42:31.156 --> 02:42:33.196]  Why, a bird with a bird flu!
[02:42:33.216 --> 02:42:37.737]  It hasn't mutated yet, but we've got to all freak out and pull our hair out.
[02:42:37.777 --> 02:42:47.519]  And it has come out that two big Bilderberg chiefs own massive stock, not just Donald Rumsfeld in this Gilead, or Gilead,
[02:42:48.519 --> 02:42:49.459]  He's calling it Gilead.
[02:42:49.499 --> 02:42:54.741]  I like the word Gilead, but it's really Gilead Pharmaceutical up there, owned by Roche.
[02:42:55.861 --> 02:42:59.182]  And it's just a big, big money maker, and so everybody will jump on the bandwagon.
[02:43:00.462 --> 02:43:07.164]  I'm not saying you shouldn't be prepared for viral outbreaks, shouldn't have your immune system up, shouldn't take vitamins, shouldn't do that.
[02:43:07.204 --> 02:43:14.906]  I just hear people saying they've got some magic bullet that heals everything and makes you grow purple hair on top of your head, and I just...
[02:43:17.137 --> 02:43:18.478]  We lose credibility, folks.
[02:43:19.019 --> 02:43:24.203]  See, in the long run, my delivery a lot of times isn't that credible, but the information is credible.
[02:43:24.443 --> 02:43:26.905]  And I do it the genuine way, so that itself is credible.
[02:43:27.306 --> 02:43:29.768]  And so over time, I just get more and more credibility.
[02:43:30.949 --> 02:43:42.559]  Over time, that's my goal, is to have credibility, do what's right, not stretch the truth, not make stuff up, and then in the end, we'll win.
[02:43:43.926 --> 02:43:45.727]  And some people don't seem to figure that out.
[02:43:45.987 --> 02:43:49.308]  They're really hurting themselves, and I'm trying to help them.
[02:43:49.328 --> 02:43:52.730]  Former Abu Ghraib general, torture is continuing.
[02:43:54.130 --> 02:43:59.813]  General says she was deliberately kept out of the loop and scapegoated to protect higher-ups.
[02:44:00.853 --> 02:44:06.015]  And she also said that the higher-ups are directing the torture specifically, and it's well known.
[02:44:06.795 --> 02:44:10.537]  And, of course, that newsmaker was yesterday on the broadcast.
[02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:13.160]  Former U.N.
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:15.862]  weapons inspector, don't rule out state government terror.
[02:44:15.902 --> 02:44:20.604]  That's what Scott Ritter said on the show yesterday, saying more than he's ever said before.
[02:44:20.664 --> 02:44:22.645]  See, it's just getting to be mainstream.
[02:44:22.705 --> 02:44:26.946]  Ray McGovern, Ron Paul saying they're preparing for martial law and gun confiscation.
[02:44:27.247 --> 02:44:31.428]  We had the general on, Janice Karpinski, yesterday.
[02:44:31.448 --> 02:44:33.770]  Two major newsmakers we had.
[02:44:35.650 --> 02:44:37.111]  Interesting thing about the weather changes.
[02:44:37.131 --> 02:44:39.012]  See, it's getting colder in some areas.
[02:44:39.921 --> 02:44:45.964]  Like Minnesota, I mean, they had record cold last year of, what, 67 degrees below zero?
[02:44:46.925 --> 02:44:49.126]  Some areas are getting thicker ice caps.
[02:44:49.646 --> 02:44:51.227]  Some ice caps are melting.
[02:44:52.548 --> 02:44:56.570]  Actual sea levels are up by a half an inch.
[02:44:57.270 --> 02:45:01.532]  In some areas, they seem to be gyrating and might be up by a foot.
[02:45:02.953 --> 02:45:07.315]  But overall, there's more ice cover on the globe than there was just 20 years ago.
[02:45:07.855 --> 02:45:08.796]  They have all this map.
[02:45:09.873 --> 02:45:16.076]  And here's CNN and Reuters both reporting, Greenland ice cap thickens slightly.
[02:45:17.196 --> 02:45:26.060]  And it says Greenland's ice cap has thickened slightly in recent years, despite wide predictions that thaw triggered by global warming, a team of scientists said on Thursday.
[02:45:27.081 --> 02:45:33.364]  So we are having climate change, folks, but global warming is a complete total fraud.
[02:45:34.564 --> 02:45:38.506]  If we're due for anything on the 12,000-year cycle, it is for an ice age.
[02:45:39.602 --> 02:45:45.664]  And right before an ice age starts, you normally see a slight heating up.
[02:45:46.985 --> 02:45:48.105]  That's what the science shows.
[02:45:50.646 --> 02:45:53.247]  People say that Washington ignores science.
[02:45:53.307 --> 02:45:53.847]  Yeah, they do.
[02:45:54.747 --> 02:45:59.069]  They ignore the fact that we are having climate change, but it's not the type they're telling us.
[02:46:00.289 --> 02:46:04.070]  Besides, what does a world tax on fuel do to stop global warming?
[02:46:04.511 --> 02:46:06.831]  China doesn't have to make any cuts, but we do.
[02:46:06.911 --> 02:46:08.572]  Even more ways to get rid of our jobs.
[02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:12.231]  As if India and China and Mexico aren't hurting us enough.
[02:46:12.251 --> 02:46:14.572]  I mean, now we've got to do this?
[02:46:14.592 --> 02:46:29.900]  The 9,842 foot thick ice cap is a key concern in debates about climate change because a total melt would raise world sea levels by about 7 meters and a runaway thaw
[02:46:30.583 --> 02:46:33.424]  Might slow the Gulf Stream that keeps the North Atlantic region warm.
[02:46:33.884 --> 02:46:43.387]  Satellite measurements showed that more snowfall was falling and thickening the ice cap, especially in high altitudes, according to the report in the Journal of Science.
[02:46:44.448 --> 02:46:45.468]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:46:46.168 --> 02:46:54.391]  Even true global warming will actually cause a larger ice cap, which then itself will trigger an ice age.
[02:46:54.631 --> 02:46:56.131]  But this isn't global warming.
[02:46:56.171 --> 02:46:57.772]  This is an ice age already starting.
[02:46:59.338 --> 02:47:01.319]  I mean, I read the scientific reports, folks.
[02:47:01.699 --> 02:47:04.199]  All the evidence shows the opposite of what they're saying.
[02:47:05.019 --> 02:47:10.601]  But don't tell the hoax people that, or the people that believe every hoax.
[02:47:10.641 --> 02:47:12.941]  They believe every Planet X story.
[02:47:12.981 --> 02:47:14.582]  They believe every pole shift story.
[02:47:15.062 --> 02:47:17.943]  They believe every global warming story.
[02:47:18.343 --> 02:47:20.483]  They believe every bird flu story.
[02:47:20.823 --> 02:47:23.364]  They believe everything but what's real and what's true.
[02:47:24.577 --> 02:47:32.360]  The government's carrying out terror attacks and putting cancer viruses in your vaccines and poisoning your food and genetically engineering everything and destroying the biosphere.
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:33.841]  Oh, you don't want to talk about that.
[02:47:35.581 --> 02:47:43.924]  You want to go join some environmental group that just steals people's property so fat cats can make hundreds of millions of dollars and they hand it over to select developers.
[02:47:44.424 --> 02:47:46.285]  Why don't you get involved in a real environmental movement?
[02:47:46.645 --> 02:47:48.746]  I ought to start a real environmental organization.
[02:47:51.047 --> 02:47:52.387]  I can't do it all, though, folks.
[02:47:52.427 --> 02:47:53.648]  I'm just so sick of it.
[02:47:56.212 --> 02:47:56.532]  U.S.
[02:47:56.572 --> 02:47:58.593]  Britain pressed for action against Syria.
[02:47:58.673 --> 02:47:59.894]  Here it is, AP.
[02:48:01.294 --> 02:48:06.837]  The United States and Britain jointly criticized Syria on Sunday and called for international action to be taken over a U.N.
[02:48:06.857 --> 02:48:14.940]  investigation that implicated Syrian officials in the killing of a former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafiq Harrier.
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:16.821]  You mean governments kill people?
[02:48:16.861 --> 02:48:18.022]  That would be a conspiracy.
[02:48:18.122 --> 02:48:19.442]  No, it's impossible.
[02:48:19.942 --> 02:48:21.243]  Governments never do wrong.
[02:48:21.283 --> 02:48:23.364]  I mean, if you never do wrong, how could Syria do wrong?
[02:48:24.005 --> 02:48:25.566]  And notice it's the good cop Q.N.
[02:48:25.586 --> 02:48:26.927]  going, very bad, very bad.
[02:48:26.947 --> 02:48:29.648]  And then Lord Bush, when we may have to attack them.
[02:48:31.689 --> 02:48:35.131]  We'll come back, jam a few calls in, cover a few final news stories as well.
[02:48:35.751 --> 02:48:37.672]  Infowars.com is the website.
[02:48:37.952 --> 02:48:43.975]  Don't forget my final showing of my new film, The Order of Death, at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, this Thursday.
[02:48:44.035 --> 02:48:45.036]  Be there, 7 o'clock.
[02:48:45.948 --> 02:48:50.294]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.494 --> 02:48:54.920]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.426]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.466 --> 02:49:00.827]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.609 --> 02:49:06.814]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.894 --> 02:49:13.821]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.941 --> 02:49:15.983]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.324 --> 02:49:17.265]  Homeland Security.
[02:49:17.625 --> 02:49:26.747]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.947 --> 02:49:32.288]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.828 --> 02:49:35.469]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:49:45.541 --> 02:49:53.787]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.048 --> 02:49:58.391]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.691 --> 02:50:07.618]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:07.818 --> 02:50:11.441]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:16.751]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.052 --> 02:50:23.765]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:50:24.272 --> 02:50:24.913]  What about you?
[02:50:25.553 --> 02:50:30.917]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:51:46.979 --> 02:51:52.142]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.803 --> 02:51:55.204]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.224 --> 02:51:56.986]  We've got four and a half minutes.
[02:51:57.006 --> 02:51:59.267]  That gives each one of you 60 seconds.
[02:51:59.347 --> 02:52:02.089]  Joe, Leandra, Mike, Daniel, I'm jamming you in.
[02:52:02.549 --> 02:52:04.351]  Joe in Florida, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:52:05.051 --> 02:52:06.292]  Hey Alex, I'll go fast.
[02:52:06.672 --> 02:52:10.935]  Isn't it kind of ironic that we're watching the video of this car and truck blow up?
[02:52:11.465 --> 02:52:16.348]  The day after it happened, but the Oklahoma City and the Pentagon videos, we haven't seen one of those yet.
[02:52:16.668 --> 02:52:21.872]  Well, they declared national security on the Oklahoma City tapes because we've talked to the police that have seen them.
[02:52:21.932 --> 02:52:25.334]  It shows McVeigh with Arabs, and we know those Arabs are CIA.
[02:52:26.174 --> 02:52:27.115]  Oh, I just wanted to bring that up.
[02:52:27.135 --> 02:52:32.658]  The other thing is I think everybody should go to antiwar.com and read Justin Raimondo's article today.
[02:52:32.698 --> 02:52:33.639]  It's very interesting.
[02:52:33.979 --> 02:52:35.340]  They always play this...
[02:52:35.799 --> 02:52:36.219]  Of course, yeah.
[02:52:36.239 --> 02:52:37.420]  Of course, the yellow cake.
[02:52:53.777 --> 02:52:58.739]  Right, but the way the media plays it is that her name was leaked to get even with Joe Wilson.
[02:52:58.779 --> 02:53:03.860]  No, her name was leaked to shut down the investigation in the Niger forgeries that came out of Rome.
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:04.380]  I agree with you.
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:05.040]  Great points.
[02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:05.921]  Call back, Joe.
[02:53:06.361 --> 02:53:08.301]  Leandro in California, go ahead.
[02:53:11.983 --> 02:53:12.463]  Let him go.
[02:53:12.483 --> 02:53:14.743]  Mike in KC, you're on the air, Mike.
[02:53:14.763 --> 02:53:15.184]  Go ahead.
[02:53:15.204 --> 02:53:17.064]  How you doing?
[02:53:17.384 --> 02:53:17.604]  Good.
[02:53:18.765 --> 02:53:21.405]  What I wanted to ask you is about the aphids.
[02:53:21.686 --> 02:53:22.586]  They're coming up with...
[02:53:23.584 --> 02:53:25.766]  Mexican illegals, how do we get rid of those things?
[02:53:27.867 --> 02:53:30.769]  I didn't know aphids were the same as lice.
[02:53:31.650 --> 02:53:32.671]  I don't know what they are.
[02:53:33.371 --> 02:53:35.192]  Well, sir, there's all sorts of problems.
[02:53:35.593 --> 02:53:37.314]  I mean, I'm not worried about lice so bad.
[02:53:37.354 --> 02:53:38.635]  That is going to be a problem.
[02:53:39.015 --> 02:53:41.517]  I'm worried about drug-resistant and drug-immune TB.
[02:53:41.917 --> 02:53:44.259]  I'm worried about spinal meningitis exploding.
[02:53:44.559 --> 02:53:49.062]  I'm worried about going from five cases a year of leprosy to 7,000.
[02:53:50.795 --> 02:53:52.276]  I mean, I'm worried about that.
[02:53:52.296 --> 02:53:53.637]  That's significant.
[02:53:55.038 --> 02:54:00.162]  Keep up the fight, Alex, and I'll be getting your movies up, recording right now as we're speaking.
[02:54:00.602 --> 02:54:01.463]  Keep it up, my friend.
[02:54:01.483 --> 02:54:02.423]  I appreciate the call.
[02:54:03.164 --> 02:54:04.785]  Let's talk to Daniel in Ohio.
[02:54:04.825 --> 02:54:05.605]  Daniel, go ahead.
[02:54:05.625 --> 02:54:06.686]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:06.806 --> 02:54:07.947]  Good to talk to you.
[02:54:08.347 --> 02:54:10.309]  I just wanted to bring up a point about the war.
[02:54:10.369 --> 02:54:12.410]  You know, we've heard so many discussions, arguments.
[02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:16.513]  The latest rotating reason is I'm afraid we may never leave because
[02:54:17.048 --> 02:54:22.550]  We're there because so many troops have died, so we can't leave.
[02:54:22.570 --> 02:54:23.170]  That's right.
[02:54:23.210 --> 02:54:29.793]  They would have died in vain unless we feed more in, and our own government's carrying out terror attacks to keep things stirred up.
[02:54:29.853 --> 02:54:31.894]  That's the official Pentagon plan.
[02:54:32.734 --> 02:54:36.796]  But we can never leave unless there's a World War III or something so catastrophic.
[02:54:37.556 --> 02:54:39.317]  I believe we're there forever, I guess.
[02:54:40.086 --> 02:54:53.374]  Well, they've said this, the war on terror is going to last 100 years, and you've got to give all your rights up and get rid of America, because Dick Cheney and George Bush and Hillary Clinton love you, and they're going to take good care of you, and David Rockefeller cares about you.
[02:54:53.894 --> 02:54:54.515]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:54:54.575 --> 02:54:55.835]  One more thing, I've got a good plug.
[02:54:55.855 --> 02:55:03.140]  I was talking on the Michael Medved show, and he thought it was all kind of funny, Alex Jones, Bohemian Grove, you know, he says it's a good old boy's club.
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:06.622]  But I've got a couple of great plugs in for Infowars.com.
[02:55:07.506 --> 02:55:09.687]  To see it for their own eyes, what goes on in there.
[02:55:09.987 --> 02:55:12.727]  Well, one caller hung up, so you've got more time.
[02:55:14.888 --> 02:55:18.409]  Specifically, I mean, what was he saying about how it was Christian and loving?
[02:55:19.549 --> 02:55:25.231]  He says he thinks it's just a good old boys club, basically, where there's a lot of drinking going on, maybe, and whatnot.
[02:55:25.271 --> 02:55:26.871]  And I said, I've seen it with my own eyes.
[02:55:27.431 --> 02:55:29.732]  Alex Jones broke the story, went in there with cameras.
[02:55:30.352 --> 02:55:35.454]  And he actually talked to me several minutes about it, and he kind of got a chuckle when I said Alex Jones.
[02:55:35.574 --> 02:55:36.854]  And I got two plugs off.
[02:55:37.346 --> 02:55:39.087]  He didn't delay you out when you did that?
[02:55:39.127 --> 02:55:39.667]  Yeah, ha, ha, ha.
[02:55:39.747 --> 02:55:41.008]  You know what?
[02:55:41.028 --> 02:55:41.488]  They're the minority.
[02:55:41.508 --> 02:55:42.128]  We're the majority.
[02:56:04.622 --> 02:56:14.970]  Okay, I mean, even if you don't think Satanism's bad, which they engage in there, the New York Post, you should have brought up the New York Post headline, Gay Porn Star Services Moguls.
[02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:18.212]  Did you bring that up to Mr. Movie Critic?
[02:56:18.972 --> 02:56:22.515]  No, he just thinks it's a little bit of a guy, maybe boozing a little bit too much.
[02:56:22.535 --> 02:56:23.255]  Hey, we're out of here.
[02:56:23.316 --> 02:56:23.816]  Thanks a lot.
[02:56:23.836 --> 02:56:24.576]  God bless you all.
[02:56:24.596 --> 02:56:25.017]  Take care.
