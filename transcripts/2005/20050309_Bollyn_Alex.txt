[00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:05.787]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:07.568]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:09.289]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.891]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:11.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:16.636]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:24.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:28.866]  I've been attacked savagely by the Washington Post, New York Times,
[00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:34.616]  And I probably devoted five minutes to each article.
[00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:49.026]  I probably devoted 20 minutes when Lionel Chetwin, the big award-winning director and the head of Homeland Security's operations taking over Hollywood, according to the Associated Press, threatened me, my wife,
[00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:50.448]  In a bathroom.
[00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:51.588]  He just said, we're going to get you.
[00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:53.650]  And then admitted it in front of witnesses.
[00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.536]  But I've been spending a couple hours on Benjamin Chertoff, reportedly, according to his mom and cousins, to the Homeland Security Director.
[00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:17.588]  And this hit piece of popular propaganda, I mean, science and mechanics, because he goes into fake reporters, controlled reporters, influence peddlers, the Hearst, I mean, who wrote the book on yellow journalism, the lies.
[00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:18.929]  They told me it was not a hit piece.
[00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:30.391]  The sniveling, bumbling of this individual, now going on the radio and attacking me and others for hours over the weekend, I'm not going to lay down for it.
[00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:35.055]  This guy, I've challenged him and his boss repeatedly to come on this show.
[00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.677]  And they have refused to come on.
[00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:41.441]  But then he'd get on the air and say, Mr. Jones needs to call in and defend himself while I'm asleep.
[00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:43.738]  on coast-to-coast AM.
[00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:50.724]  He's a callin' and defendin' himself and if he doesn't callin' and defendin' himself, well that just shows that he just isn't, you know, that he's afraid.
[00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:52.366]  He can't refute these facts.
[00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.807]  And I hope he never called in!
[00:01:53.807 --> 00:02:00.554]  Uh, so, when in truth, I've been challenging this young punk to come on here and do it.
[00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:14.953]  Joining us is respected researcher and journalist Christopher Bolin for American Free Press, Chertoff's cousin, penned popular Mechanics 9-11 hit piece, and to delve into this with us is Christopher Bolin.
[00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:16.634]  Christopher, honored to have you.
[00:02:16.634 --> 00:02:18.495]  Thank you.
[00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:25.340]  A lot of stations carry the news right now, so we'll have to recap whatever we say coming up in the next segment, but let's get into this piece.
[00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:27.614]  Sure.
[00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:38.162]  Well, when the piece came out, I noticed that the first writer mentioned was Benjamin Chertoff, and I tried to reach Popular Mechanics on a number of occasions to ask them.
[00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:45.328]  You know, the person who's supposed to speak for the newspaper is a man named Nathan Christopher, but he never answers his phone or his backup numbers.
[00:02:45.328 --> 00:02:51.573]  So I called Benjamin Chertoff, and I asked him, you know, well, you're calling people like Eric Hoochman and myself liars.
[00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.975]  And I asked him some questions.
[00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:56.197]  I said, by the way, are you related to Michael Chertoff?
[00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.558]  And he said, I don't know.
[00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:02.501]  And so then I just did a little research in the telephone books for Pelham, New York, where he went to high school.
[00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.845]  He graduated from high school in Pelham, New York, in 1998.
[00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:14.252]  And I found in the 1998 phone book for Westchester County, where Pelham is, that there was a Judith Chertoff living there.
[00:03:14.252 --> 00:03:19.757]  In the past few years, she's remarried and her last name is now Dargan.
[00:03:19.757 --> 00:03:23.080]  But in any case, I called her up and her number hasn't changed.
[00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.373]  And I asked her, you know, I read this piece in Popular Mechanics, and I said, um, is Benjamin Chertoff your son?
[00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:29.153]  And she said, sure!
[00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:31.214]  And I said, well, that's very interesting.
[00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:34.876]  I said, is he related to the great Michael Chertoff, the new Homeland Security czar?
[00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:37.517]  And she said, yes, of course, he's a cousin.
[00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:47.082]  And I listened last night, or the other night, to this show, this Coast to Coast Radio, and, uh, they really, uh, because I sent an open letter to Art Bell, that, you know, are you going to talk about this relationship?
[00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:48.463]  Because this is really egregious.
[00:03:49.048 --> 00:03:54.369]  To have a cousin of the man who is now head of... I think this is going to be a major scandal.
[00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.930]  I think this is going to be a scandal.
[00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.892]  It's pretty egregious because this is the kind of propaganda that is done in dictatorships like the one we've deposed in Iraq.
[00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:11.094]  Where you have cousins and brothers and sisters of senior officials writing propaganda to support the regime.
[00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:21.701]  Well, and this on the heels of Gannon, the man-whore, and all the fake reporters, and the Armstrong Williams.
[00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:22.862]  Yeah.
[00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:23.783]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:26.825]  And this is really bad, bad journalism.
[00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:33.189]  I'm going to address the essence of the Popular Mechanics piece this week, but just for example, look at what... Well, stay there.
[00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.711]  I want to recap your conversation with Ms.
[00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:37.753]  Chertoff, then I want to get into
[00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:40.442]  Your analysis of it.
[00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:46.066]  And I want to tell you about my conversations with Mr. Chertoff and others.
[00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:50.389]  Because they swore to me this is not a hit piece, Mr. Jones.
[00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.090]  And they're a pack of liars.
[00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.711]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:04.492]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:09.075]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:13.478]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:14.859]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.904]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:27.971]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.973]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:30.353 --> 00:05:40.958]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:46.860]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:21.164]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:26.867]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:33.993]  All tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:05.156]  Big Brother
[00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.632]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:09.352]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.352 --> 00:08:10.973]  You want answers?
[00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:12.533]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:16.714]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:21.836]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:25.037]  I see everything in terms of warfare.
[00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:26.197]  That's how the globalists see it.
[00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:39.866]  And I see Benjamin Chertoff, reportedly the cousin of the Homeland Security Director, in his hit piece as an enemy gun emplacement firing on our positions and our advancing forces.
[00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:43.826]  Their receding propaganda armies are being defeated by us.
[00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:51.888]  And because this emplacement has, well, is not well defended and has engaged in a shoddy attack,
[00:08:53.047 --> 00:09:05.097]  We are now rolling our information warfare howitzers into place, and they admit they've been hammered into the ground already by the, quote, people out there that read it.
[00:09:05.097 --> 00:09:17.246]  I don't think they've even begun to understand the concerted firepower of our entire raid forces against them by the time we're done with them.
[00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.985]  This will only make us stronger.
[00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:23.606]  We are going to take this enemy island, this enemy emplacement with the Infowar.
[00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:30.788]  We are going to lay siege to their propaganda and dismantle it piece by piece.
[00:09:30.788 --> 00:09:41.091]  And the reason I brought up the case of the White House male prostitute, male madam, you know, really working for the White House, paid through a website,
[00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:54.928]  And, uh, you know, in there planting questions, and it goes into the Armstrong Williams, and just all these fake reporters, is that if it is true, and I believe Christopher Bolin, American Free Press, that he is a close cousin,
[00:09:56.286 --> 00:10:01.629]  To Mr. Michael Chertoff, the Homeland Security Director, Benjamin Chertoff.
[00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:07.191]  That is a serious conflict of interest because Mr. Chertoff was intimately involved in covering up 9-11.
[00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:12.034]  He defended some of the biggest funders of the supposed hijackers.
[00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:13.874]  This is very, very serious.
[00:10:13.874 --> 00:10:17.376]  We've talked about Mr. Chertoff at length on this broadcast.
[00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:24.700]  It's Mr. Chertoff who says the President's above the law, just like Alberto Gonzales, the architect of much of Patriot Act 1 and 2 with Viet Dinh.
[00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:27.362]  And Gonzalez and others.
[00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:30.003]  So, very serious.
[00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:36.485]  And here's the headline from Christopher Bolin's excellent column that we have a link to on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:40.567]  Chertoff's cousin penned popular mechanics 9-1-1 hit piece.
[00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:45.829]  Dictators like Saddam Hussein have always used nepotism to protect their secrets and maintain control.
[00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:48.698]  Look at North Korea, look at Bush.
[00:10:48.698 --> 00:10:51.980]  When you have hereditary systems, you're in deep trouble.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:59.926]  Like a dictatorship, the inner cabal that directs the actions of the Bush administration uses the same tactics to confuse the public and conceal the truth about 9-11.
[00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:07.374]  Dictators have always employed nepotism, the placing of family members in key positions, for one simple reason.
[00:11:07.374 --> 00:11:12.416]  Only loyal family members can be trusted with the secrets that keep them in power.
[00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:22.482]  For this reason, the shameless nepotism of the Bush Administration should alarm Americans because it indicates that a dictatorship is encroaching upon the United States.
[00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:29.046]  The Defense Department defines nepotism as a situation in which relatives are in the same chain of command.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:41.668]  And an egregious example of dictatorial-style nepotism occurred when George W. Bush won the White House twice, thanks to key swing state of Florida, where the presidential candidate's younger brother is governor.
[00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.990]  And again, his father, former president.
[00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.753]  In 2000-2004, against all odds, Florida swung decisively the Bush way.
[00:11:48.753 --> 00:11:53.236]  With Hyde, and of course Bush is related to Jerry as well.
[00:11:54.114 --> 00:12:15.195]  With high federal offices being given to wives, sons and daughters of senior members of the Bush administration, the Hearst Corporation's executives that publish Popular Mechanics magazine probably didn't worry about the ethical considerations of hiring a cousin of Michael Chertoff, a former assistant attorney general and the new secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, a senior researcher.
[00:12:15.655 --> 00:12:26.083]  But the March 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics plums new depths of nepotism and Hearst-style yellow journalism, which they wrote the book on, I would add, with its cover story about 9-11.
[00:12:28.064 --> 00:12:31.405]  We will continue with this, again joining us Christopher Bolin.
[00:12:31.405 --> 00:12:43.848]  Christopher, recap why you got interested in the peace, obviously it attacked you and others, myself included, and then how you tracked back to Mr. Chertoff's mommy.
[00:12:43.848 --> 00:12:55.291]  Mr. Chertoff said he didn't know if the Homeland Security leader or Fuhrer leader was his family, but mommy sure knew all about it.
[00:12:56.659 --> 00:12:58.761]  Recap what you talked about in the last segment.
[00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:17.018]  Sure, well what, um, you know, this piece in Popular Mechanics is basically the first time that the popular media, the mainstream media, has thrown down the gauntlet to people like myself and Eric Hofschmid and Dave von Kleist and yourself, who are what I call the independent researchers, who are, you know, investigating this mass murder that occurred on September 11th.
[00:13:17.018 --> 00:13:21.302]  And now this, you have to remember, this was an example, this was a case of mass murder.
[00:13:21.741 --> 00:13:32.667]  At least 3,000 Americans died, and I just don't... And they hauled all the steel away, despite the fact that the firefighters objected, the families objected, went to Congress, just like Oklahoma City, just like WICO.
[00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:41.513]  Right, and then it was, you know, when the Bush and Cheney administration were adamantly opposed to any investigation... Then they tried to appoint Henry Kissinger!
[00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:46.996]  Then they said that they'd never heard of a plan to fly planes into buildings, now we have THE memo being specific!
[00:13:48.012 --> 00:13:49.273]  Right, and they lied to us!
[00:13:49.273 --> 00:13:51.513]  I mean, this is why we're questioning!
[00:13:51.513 --> 00:14:02.818]  And they said that the operation, you know, that they couldn't investigate this mass murder in Manhattan, and in the Pentagon, because it would take away from their colonial war in Afghanistan.
[00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:05.799]  Now that makes zero sense to most Americans.
[00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:09.320]  But when I read this piece, you know, because this throws down the gauntlet for the first time in a big way.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.602]  Popular Mechanics used to be a piece, I mean, a magazine I read as a child.
[00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:16.183]  And I looked right away to who wrote it, and Benjamin Chertoff's name is at the top,
[00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:18.560]  A bit of alphabetical order, I suppose.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.484]  But I then, I called up the magazine.
[00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:22.127]  No, it says he's the head guy.
[00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:28.660]  Yeah, when I called up, I called up, they have a publicist, a man named Nathan Christopher, who's supposed to speak for the magazine.
[00:14:29.473 --> 00:14:30.634]  But he never answers his phone.
[00:14:30.634 --> 00:14:35.997]  I tried for a long time, but then I called up... Let me stop you again, and I apologize I'm jumping in so much.
[00:14:35.997 --> 00:14:40.720]  Here is his bio, posted on Popular Mechanics and on Coast to Coast.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:50.986]  As research editor for Popular Mechanics, Benjamin Chertoff is responsible for upholding journalistic standards for the magazine, as well as ensuring all stories of Popular Mechanics are reported completely and accurately.
[00:14:51.706 --> 00:15:01.870]  And it goes on to say he is the senior reporter for the magazine's special March issue, 9-11, debunking the myths and lies, managing a team of dogged and intrepid professional researchers.
[00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.331]  Folks, he could hardly finish a sentence.
[00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:06.412]  I thought it was a fake interview.
[00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:07.572]  He was bumbling.
[00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:11.394]  And he told me this is not a hit piece, over and over again.
[00:15:11.394 --> 00:15:12.074]  Go ahead.
[00:15:12.074 --> 00:15:12.815]  Yes, I called him up.
[00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:15.716]  I got through to him and I asked him if he was a senior researcher for the piece.
[00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:16.296]  He said he was.
[00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:19.743]  And then I asked him, you know, are you related to Michael Chertoff?
[00:15:19.743 --> 00:15:21.465]  And he told me he didn't know.
[00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:23.326]  He didn't say yes, he didn't say no.
[00:15:23.326 --> 00:15:27.170]  He said, I don't know, which is, you know, one way of lying.
[00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.391]  Either you know or you don't.
[00:15:28.391 --> 00:15:29.732]  I do not recall.
[00:15:29.732 --> 00:15:31.133]  Yeah, he said he didn't know if he was related.
[00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:38.619]  So then, you know, I looked into the phone books of Westchester County, where he grew up, and he graduated from high school in 1998 from Pelham.
[00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:39.359]  So he's about a 25-year-old guy.
[00:15:40.362 --> 00:15:42.904]  And he went, I think, to New York State University.
[00:15:42.904 --> 00:15:54.271]  But I called up to... I looked in the phone book and there was a Jew of the Sheriff's Office, I think a single mother, living, you know, in Pelham, which is a very small town, north of New York City, in 1998.
[00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:55.592]  So I called her up.
[00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:56.512]  Her name has changed now.
[00:15:56.512 --> 00:15:58.133]  She's got a new husband.
[00:15:58.133 --> 00:16:00.835]  But I asked her, I said, you know, hello, Judy.
[00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.437]  I said, I read this piece in Popular Mechanics.
[00:16:03.437 --> 00:16:05.758]  Can you tell me, is Benjamin Sheriff's Office your son?
[00:16:05.758 --> 00:16:07.139]  And she said, yes, yes, of course.
[00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.480]  You know, every mother's proud of her son.
[00:16:09.256 --> 00:16:19.384]  And then I asked her, I said, by any chance, if he related to Mike, you know, the great, I had to, you know, beef up a little bit, the great Michael Chertoff, the new czar of Homeland Security.
[00:16:19.384 --> 00:16:22.085]  And she said, yes, yes, he's a cousin.
[00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:24.327]  And that was what I really wanted to hear.
[00:16:24.327 --> 00:16:29.911]  But when her husband heard that she was revealing these state secrets on the phone, he's very protective.
[00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:33.734]  He came over and he told me, he took the phone away from his wife and said that I should
[00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.993]  You know, I should contact Benjamin Chertoff at the magazine, like he had told me before.
[00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:40.295]  And I said, well, I did, but he didn't know.
[00:16:40.295 --> 00:16:46.800]  And so, last night, or the other night, on Coast to Coast Radio, he was also, again, being very disingenuous.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.203]  He pretended again, saying that he didn't know if he's related to Michael Chertoff.
[00:16:51.203 --> 00:16:54.726]  And Art Bell supported him by saying, oh yeah, maybe you're the 14th millionth cousin.
[00:16:54.726 --> 00:16:57.308]  You know, like, so far removed.
[00:16:57.308 --> 00:17:01.391]  And Benjamin Chertoff said on the radio that his mother had told me he was a distant cousin.
[00:17:01.391 --> 00:17:01.971]  That's false.
[00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:02.972]  That's a lie.
[00:17:02.972 --> 00:17:03.793]  She told me he's a cousin.
[00:17:04.474 --> 00:17:08.736]  So, I mean, you know, they're still trying to hide this relationship.
[00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:15.820]  And Americans should be concerned about this, because this is a very egregious example of this nepotism and propaganda in this country.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:25.626]  Well, plus a piece of shoddy... I mean, they quote this spokesman for NORAD who says they never intercepted one plane except for Payne Stewart in the ten years before 9-11.
[00:17:25.626 --> 00:17:30.388]  That very same major is in the Associated Press saying 60-plus times in the year before 9-11.
[00:17:30.388 --> 00:17:30.548]  Right.
[00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:32.209]  Right.
[00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:36.411]  And then there's another case where they talk about World Trade Center building number 7.
[00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:38.332]  This is the 47 story building that collapsed.
[00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:39.153]  I brought that up to him.
[00:17:39.153 --> 00:17:41.114]  I said, Larry Silverstein says they pulled it.
[00:17:41.114 --> 00:17:41.794]  Do you want that?
[00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:43.775]  And he's just like, uh, no.
[00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:44.796]  Right.
[00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:45.376]  Right.
[00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:51.779]  And the thing is, though, is that they say in the piece in Popular Mechanics that the front, the south facade of that building was scooped out 25%.
[00:17:53.499 --> 00:18:01.742]  Well, just this morning I called up Dr. Gene Corley, who was the team leader for the FEMA study, the engineering study, that was done in 2001 and 2002 at the site.
[00:18:01.742 --> 00:18:07.704]  These are the people, the engineers, who accumulated, who gathered the evidence and put it together there.
[00:18:07.704 --> 00:18:12.926]  Look, I have the official New York collapse radius.
[00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.147]  It wasn't even in it.
[00:18:14.147 --> 00:18:16.708]  The building wasn't hit by the towers.
[00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.328]  And they say in the article it was.
[00:18:18.328 --> 00:18:18.688]  Right.
[00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:23.210]  And Dr. Corley told me this morning, he said that there's no evidence of that.
[00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.713]  And something else they do in the article, is they say that
[00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:37.958]  We say fire melted the steel.
[00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.561]  No, we say fire couldn't melt steel.
[00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:44.644]  It was the government that said that, and they go, oh look, they're wrong.
[00:18:44.644 --> 00:18:46.025]  We just said weakened.
[00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:50.088]  So, they actually take what the government said and then say we said it.
[00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:57.434]  Right, and Americans should know that the official explanation for the collapse of the Twin Towers is that it was not the planes that caused the collapse.
[00:18:57.825 --> 00:19:01.627]  Nor was it the fires caused by the burning jet fuel.
[00:19:01.627 --> 00:19:03.928]  No, it's the secondary fires.
[00:19:03.928 --> 00:19:05.729]  They say it's the secondary fires.
[00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:11.072]  But in their article, they say it was the planes.
[00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:14.154]  So he doesn't even have the official government story.
[00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.054]  No, they don't have it quite right.
[00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:18.636]  But at one point they do kind of talk about secondary fires.
[00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:22.318]  But another thing is that this piece in this magazine, Popular Mechanics,
[00:19:23.139 --> 00:19:25.961]  It's a heavy bit of emotional manipulation.
[00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:32.225]  If you just read through it, it's like, you know, everything that you or I... How dare them do this to the families!
[00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:34.026]  How dare them do this to the families!
[00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:38.128]  When the families have marched around the White House with signs saying Bush did it!
[00:19:38.128 --> 00:19:39.409]  Right.
[00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:40.450]  Right.
[00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.453]  But everything we present is blurry photos and sketchy eyewitness accounts, and what they present is hard evidence and common sense.
[00:19:45.453 --> 00:19:46.734]  You see?
[00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:48.515]  And they use the word evidence.
[00:19:48.515 --> 00:19:48.955]  Evidence.
[00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:49.455]  Fact.
[00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:49.896]  Fact.
[00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:50.136]  Fact.
[00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:56.058]  Just like Ashcroft says it's an urban legend that he ever said weapons of mass destruction.
[00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:57.919]  He never said it, he told us so.
[00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:01.000]  We'll be back, sir.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.681]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:07.882]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:20:07.882 --> 00:20:08.842]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:20:08.842 --> 00:20:11.683]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:20:11.883 --> 00:20:16.988]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:20:16.988 --> 00:20:18.249]  Check out this new product.

[00:20:33.223 --> 00:20:36.465]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:41.967]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:42.848]  Try No-BO.

[00:22:54.091 --> 00:23:04.542]  This is Jeff Donovan and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostick.
[00:23:04.542 --> 00:23:07.725]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[00:23:07.725 --> 00:23:08.526]  Her name is Joni.
[00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:12.370]  She already lost 12 pounds in only 7 days and she was so excited.
[00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.214]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:21.158]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[00:23:21.158 --> 00:23:23.000]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.982]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:34.830]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry, and as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.751]  It's a great product.
[00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:38.672]  And you're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[00:23:38.672 --> 00:23:41.833]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:43.294]  You don't pay anything up front.
[00:23:43.294 --> 00:23:48.295]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:48.735]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:48.855]  1-888-223-2838.
[00:23:48.855 --> 00:23:50.356]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:09.007]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:12.630]  Alright folks, so stay with us.
[00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:17.935]  But, uh, here out of their own popular mechanics article, it says, intercepts not routine.
[00:24:17.935 --> 00:24:27.843]  It has been standard operating procedure for decades to immediately intercept off course planes that do not respond to communications from air traffic controllers, says the website oilempire.us.
[00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:33.729]  When the Air Force scrambles a fighter plane to intercept, they usually reach the plane in a question of minutes.
[00:24:33.729 --> 00:24:34.069]  Fact!
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:41.763]  In the decade before 9-11, NORAD intercepted only one civilian plane over North America, Golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet.
[00:24:41.763 --> 00:24:46.125]  Now again, I have USA Today saying hundreds of times.
[00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:56.530]  In October of 99, with passengers and crew unconscious from cabin depressurization, the plane lost radio contact but remained in transponder contact until it crashed.
[00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:01.692]  Even so, it took F-16s an hour and 22 minutes to reach the stricken ship.
[00:25:01.692 --> 00:25:03.233]  USA Today says 18 minutes.
[00:25:04.813 --> 00:25:06.254]  AP says 20.
[00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:07.815]  I don't know what's true.
[00:25:07.815 --> 00:25:26.705]  But you can find the number that they didn't know for an hour and 22 minutes that the plane wasn't responding to radio calls because it flew out of Florida over Georgia and then out towards the west over rural areas and it was flying at low speeds and an hour and 22 minutes in they learned that it wasn't responding
[00:25:27.285 --> 00:25:31.910]  Then they launched F-16s and they were there in around 20 minutes.
[00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.956]  Now that's USA Today, AP, Reuters, hundreds of articles were written about it.
[00:25:36.956 --> 00:25:37.737]  It's part of the record.
[00:25:37.737 --> 00:25:45.045]  Now listen, their own expert they quote in here as saying they never launched this is Major Douglas Martin, Public Affairs Officer for NORAD.
[00:25:45.345 --> 00:26:05.659]  Type Major Douglas Martin into a search engine, then add AP, then add Fighter Intercept, and you'll get AP articles where he mentions the hundreds of times, the 68, I believe, I didn't bring the article today, I should have, I covered it on NPR, 68 times in the year before 9-11.
[00:26:05.659 --> 00:26:08.101]  So, I mean, this is insane, folks.
[00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:14.265]  And I sent the articles to NPR, they gave the editor Megs,
[00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:23.303]  Almost 17 minutes gave me about 3 or 4 minutes, 2 minutes of it with the interviewer talking over me.
[00:26:23.303 --> 00:26:25.884]  That's their idea of a fair interview.
[00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:32.447]  Going back to our guest, please continue, Christopher Bolin.
[00:26:32.447 --> 00:26:34.728]  Yeah, what do you want me to talk about here now?
[00:26:34.728 --> 00:26:37.510]  Well, you were mentioning these clear connections
[00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:41.904]  With him, and some of the past writing he's done.
[00:26:41.904 --> 00:26:53.409]  Yeah, the thing that's very interesting about Benjamin Chertoff is that he was writing before, his resume is online there, he mentioned that he wrote for Men's Journal.
[00:26:53.409 --> 00:27:01.132]  And he wrote a piece about a couple years ago in this Men's Journal in which he ranked the 25 toughest guys in America.
[00:27:01.132 --> 00:27:03.974]  And he made Hillary Clinton the 25th toughest guy.
[00:27:05.075 --> 00:27:13.786]  And this shows a great deal of animosity towards Mrs. Clinton, who is, after all, the senator from his state.
[00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:18.632]  And this goes back to the animosity that exists between Michael Chertoff
[00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:26.693]  And Hillary Clinton, because Michael Chertoff was the prosecutor in the Whitewater investigation.
[00:27:26.693 --> 00:27:30.517]  And he was actually there to make sure it never got off into substantive issues.
[00:27:30.517 --> 00:27:31.598]  Yeah.
[00:27:31.598 --> 00:27:33.459]  And again, we're not saying we like Hillary, folks.
[00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:34.861]  It's just another connection.
[00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:40.747]  And it's very important that Michael Chertoff also was in a key position in New Jersey
[00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:47.130]  During the investigation, at the time of the first bombing of the World Trade Center, was that 1993, I think?
[00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.411]  Yes.
[00:27:48.411 --> 00:27:56.916]  When these characters that were allegedly involved in it, all of these Egyptian informants for the FBI, etc., were living in New Jersey.
[00:27:56.916 --> 00:28:03.520]  And then Ahmad Salam said, they told me to cut the bomb and drain the driver, they paid him over a million dollars to shut up.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.521]  Right, right.
[00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:08.604]  He was paid a million dollars, he was a million dollar paid informant for the FBI.
[00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:09.624]  And the other thing is that
[00:28:11.368 --> 00:28:21.856]  Michael Sharatov was Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice at the time of the World Trade Center attack in 2001 and in the aftermath.
[00:28:21.856 --> 00:28:32.265]  And in the aftermath, you'll recall that many Israelis who were picked up as art students or as fake moving company employees were sent back to Israel
[00:28:33.558 --> 00:28:36.260]  And that wasn't even covered by Fox News!
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.682]  And yet these characters were sent back to Israel on visa violations without being properly investigated and interrogated?
[00:28:56.775 --> 00:28:58.556]  This was Michael Chertoff's doing.
[00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:09.683]  So you see, the Israeli suspects in 9-1-1 were given a path to go home, where at the same time they picked up 800 Middle Easterners who had done nothing in relation to terrorism.
[00:29:09.683 --> 00:29:18.988]  And now we have a cousin who goes and does Iraq work embedded, but now off attacking us.
[00:29:18.988 --> 00:29:20.569]  Pretty obvious.
[00:29:20.569 --> 00:29:21.430]  Yeah, very egregious.
[00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:24.876]  Well, we'll talk about what should happen now.
[00:29:24.876 --> 00:29:27.797]  I mean, this is, um... They've thrown down the gauntlet.
[00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:33.380]  Honest scientists and honest researchers of this country have to stand up to this.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.602]  They have thrown down the gauntlet, and they're gonna get a fight if they want one.
[00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:37.963]  They're gonna get one.
[00:29:37.963 --> 00:29:39.143]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:39.143 --> 00:29:44.306]  I wonder if Mr. Chertoff will sick his cousin on us.
[00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:46.787]  Homeland Security leader.
[00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:48.628]  Guess we'll all be on no-fly list real fast.
[00:29:50.402 --> 00:29:51.802]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.802 --> 00:29:54.323]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.323 --> 00:30:00.145]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.145 --> 00:30:08.487]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:09.948]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:30:09.948 --> 00:30:11.008]  Now check this out.
[00:30:11.008 --> 00:30:14.729]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:16.890]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.313]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:30:20.313 --> 00:30:21.354]  Your health suffers.
[00:30:21.354 --> 00:30:22.336]  It's that simple.
[00:30:22.336 --> 00:30:24.278]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[00:30:24.278 --> 00:30:26.720]  With the dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:34.649]  The dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio, was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:43.717]  A Garricus Bio.

[00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:05.599]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:13.968]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:13.968 --> 00:31:21.015]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:22.556]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:31:22.556 --> 00:31:28.640]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.844]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:33.844 --> 00:31:42.990]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.313]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:33:03.808 --> 00:33:07.490]  Alright, coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to give you the phone number.
[00:33:08.977 --> 00:33:13.179]  To Popular Mechanics, to the publisher, call them.
[00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:20.101]  I mean, Mr. Chertoff wants to get on the radio and go, Oh, Alex could call and defend himself right now and then hours later, Oh, see, he didn't.
[00:33:20.101 --> 00:33:23.382]  He can't defend himself against these facts.
[00:33:23.382 --> 00:33:24.703]  I've called them over and over again.
[00:33:24.703 --> 00:33:30.725]  I want himself and, of course, the editor Megs on here.
[00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:32.286]  I'll be polite to them.
[00:33:32.286 --> 00:33:36.567]  I want to decipher and dismantle their false arguments.
[00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:38.088]  Just all of what they've done.
[00:33:38.643 --> 00:33:41.645]  We're going to give their phone number out if you have a subscription to these guys.
[00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:45.248]  I want you to call them and cancel your subscription.
[00:33:45.248 --> 00:33:49.472]  And as far as I'm concerned, Popular Mechanics' name is Mudd.
[00:33:49.472 --> 00:33:52.635]  They also have Popular Science.
[00:33:52.635 --> 00:33:55.557]  And I want to talk a little bit about the history of Hearst Publishing.
[00:33:55.557 --> 00:33:59.020]  I mean, again, they wrote the book on yellow journalism, folks.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:04.925]  They were the ones telling the country that it was, you know, that the Spanish had blown up the main.
[00:34:05.911 --> 00:34:10.153]  I mean, they're just classic, classic big dogs in the New World Order.
[00:34:10.153 --> 00:34:11.953]  In the New World Odor.
[00:34:11.953 --> 00:34:15.395]  And they're not going to get away with it, Citizen Kane.
[00:34:15.395 --> 00:34:16.195]  That's not going to happen.
[00:34:16.195 --> 00:34:20.476]  Real quick, before we go back to our guests, in Pittsburgh, Lord Bush is about to arrive.
[00:34:20.476 --> 00:34:21.677]  The police are threatening to arrest...
[00:34:22.242 --> 00:34:24.663]  The peaceful protesters there, and Adam has called in.
[00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:25.804]  Adam, go ahead.
[00:34:25.804 --> 00:34:26.845]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:34:26.845 --> 00:34:27.805]  Good.
[00:34:27.805 --> 00:34:30.146]  Yeah, we got down here a little while ago.
[00:34:30.146 --> 00:34:37.771]  Lord Bush and the Mrs. are about to arrive at 3 o'clock to go over their faith-based initiatives here at the Community College of Allegheny County.
[00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:40.252]  Their federal takeover of the churches, okay?
[00:34:40.252 --> 00:34:41.213]  Exactly.
[00:34:41.213 --> 00:34:50.818]  Now, what happened was a group of protesters, about 20 or 30 or so, had assembled across the street, right across the street from where Bush and his entourage are going to be arriving when they get here.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:35:09.473]  Now, campus security from the college and the Pittsburgh police came up to us on several occasions, threatening us with arrest, and basically herded the entire crowd of protesters about five or six blocks away from where Bush is going to be arriving, so that they'll have basically no effect at all.
[00:35:09.473 --> 00:35:13.496]  I remember getting to protest Bill Clinton when he came to Austin three times.
[00:35:13.496 --> 00:35:15.217]  They didn't stop us then.
[00:35:15.217 --> 00:35:19.980]  They're now arresting people in other areas of the country.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.901]  It's disgusting.
[00:35:21.713 --> 00:35:23.915]  And, uh, it's just indicative.
[00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:28.178]  I mean, the Führer cannot see you protesting him.
[00:35:28.178 --> 00:35:32.821]  I mean, nobody's being, nobody's, uh... And that way the media can show him, pull up unmolested.
[00:35:33.875 --> 00:35:40.977]  I mean, nobody's been violent, nobody's been confrontational with the police, but the police are starting to escalate their behavior.
[00:35:40.977 --> 00:35:58.162]  I just saw an article in the LA Times, you know, the nurses group of 60,000 are exposing the things Arnold's doing, so Arnold went to a public showing of the new John Travolta movie, and a woman who wasn't even part of the group had come in her scrubs from a nurse to come see the movie, didn't even know the governor was coming, and they came and arrested her.
[00:35:59.266 --> 00:36:02.968]  I mean, this is what they do to Americans now, folks.
[00:36:02.968 --> 00:36:03.968]  And here's the deal.
[00:36:03.968 --> 00:36:15.513]  We're standing on a public sidewalk, paid for by the taxpayers' money, and the Pittsburgh Police and Campus Security have both come up to us and threatened us with arrest for trespassing on private property.
[00:36:15.513 --> 00:36:21.836]  So now all the public sidewalks in America, I guess according to the Pittsburgh Police, are now private property.
[00:36:21.836 --> 00:36:25.798]  Sir, there are people that have gone, let me just tell you this, people have gone to prison.
[00:36:26.118 --> 00:36:28.119]  Thank you for the call.
[00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:28.940]  Call us back with the developments.
[00:36:52.757 --> 00:36:54.058]  I've got some video footage.
[00:36:54.058 --> 00:36:57.881]  I'll upload it to the web and send you a link when I get around to editing it.
[00:36:57.881 --> 00:36:58.561]  Absolutely.
[00:36:58.561 --> 00:36:59.302]  Send it to us, sir.
[00:36:59.302 --> 00:37:00.262]  We'll put it on the server.
[00:37:00.262 --> 00:37:01.263]  Thank you.
[00:37:01.263 --> 00:37:02.304]  Great job, Adam.
[00:37:02.304 --> 00:37:05.886]  They're trying to arrest your callback.
[00:37:05.886 --> 00:37:06.707]  Unbelievable.
[00:37:06.707 --> 00:37:10.690]  Just going back to our guest, continuing with Christopher Bolin,
[00:37:11.645 --> 00:37:16.550]  Christopher, they've got to be getting desperate if they're pulling out all the stops and attacking us.
[00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:24.137]  Yeah, that's what... I've been in touch with Eric Huffschmid, author of Painful Questions, and Dave Van Kleist about this, and also Phil Jahan.
[00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:26.900]  Because, like yourself, they're mentioned in the article.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.483]  And that's what the consensus is.
[00:37:30.483 --> 00:37:35.548]  I think that they're trying to, at this point, you know, they obviously have to try to claim the history.
[00:37:36.401 --> 00:37:37.942]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:37:37.942 --> 00:37:55.767]  And they're trying to manipulate, emotionally manipulate Americans into accepting this rewrite, their rewrite in Popular Mechanics, where Americans really need to look at the evidence that's presented, the real evidence in books like Painful Questions and in Dave Von Kleist's video, and also what I've presented and what I've found out.
[00:37:55.767 --> 00:37:59.908]  For example, the first thing that they talk about is, where's the pod?
[00:37:59.908 --> 00:38:03.469]  And they show a photograph of the bottom of the plane, you know, a selected digital photograph,
[00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:07.552]  And they circle something that was never claimed to be the pod.
[00:38:07.552 --> 00:38:11.593]  But like Dave on Crisis, the question is, what about the flash?
[00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:12.913]  It's the flash, idiot!
[00:38:12.913 --> 00:38:14.753]  I think that's his new piece.
[00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:19.314]  You see, it's this flash that occurred when Flight 175 hit the South Tower.
[00:38:19.314 --> 00:38:21.275]  Well, regardless... That's the important thing.
[00:38:21.275 --> 00:38:22.455]  Regardless of the flash.
[00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:32.677]  What I cover in Road to Tyranny is public officials being warned not to fly, admitted, CIA insider trading, flying out the Al-Qaeda and Taliban out of Afghanistan, 8,000 of them,
[00:38:34.117 --> 00:38:58.136]  You know, New Yorker Magazine, Associated Press, I focus in on NORAD, did stand down, Dick Cheney was in control, they were running drills that morning, and I cover all that in my new film, Marshall Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, but really, we need to get the ball rolling here on Mr. Chertoff, but let me just give you this, you know, before your article you're writing, on record, on radio, I'm telling you this.
[00:38:59.466 --> 00:39:03.427]  He told me, and the editor above him told me, this is not a hit piece.
[00:39:03.427 --> 00:39:04.367]  We promise.
[00:39:04.367 --> 00:39:05.348]  Oh, no, no.
[00:39:05.348 --> 00:39:08.028]  That's not what we're doing.
[00:39:08.028 --> 00:39:11.189]  We're just getting the different popular ideas that are out there.
[00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:12.290]  We promise.
[00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.210]  We're just going to present this.
[00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.191]  This is not a hit piece.
[00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:16.591]  Right.
[00:39:16.591 --> 00:39:21.272]  And then every time, you know, like with Building 7, I said, well, Larry Silverstein, the owner, says they pulled it.
[00:39:21.272 --> 00:39:23.093]  He goes, he didn't want to see that.
[00:39:23.093 --> 00:39:23.893]  I sent them that.
[00:39:24.841 --> 00:39:25.021]  Right.
[00:39:25.021 --> 00:39:31.524]  And they would do stuff like call up and say, well we called the seismologist and they say they didn't talk to you or your person.
[00:39:31.524 --> 00:39:36.226]  I go, the article we have clearly sources you, Christopher Bolin.
[00:39:36.226 --> 00:39:36.646]  Right.
[00:39:36.646 --> 00:39:40.047]  Did you ask the seismologist if they talked to Christopher Bolin?
[00:39:40.047 --> 00:39:40.367]  No.
[00:39:40.367 --> 00:39:45.309]  And I had to call his editor and say, you better not, see that's a trick they were playing.
[00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.950]  Of course.
[00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.110]  And they play all sorts of these little tricks.
[00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.471]  Of course.
[00:39:49.471 --> 00:39:51.732]  This is a real manipulative article.
[00:39:51.732 --> 00:39:54.513]  That's the most important thing and that's why I call it
[00:39:54.952 --> 00:39:57.274]  This is a classic in yellow journalism.
[00:39:57.274 --> 00:39:58.455]  And a classic case.
[00:39:58.455 --> 00:39:59.936]  And this is plumbing new depths.
[00:39:59.936 --> 00:40:06.240]  And I agree completely with you that this popular mechanic has to have their feet held to the fire about this.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.444]  Because this is such a distortion of the facts.
[00:40:10.444 --> 00:40:13.466]  In all respects, it's a complete distortion.
[00:40:14.824 --> 00:40:21.487]  So again, on the record, you talk to Mr. Chertoff's mommy, and she's like, of course he's family, he's our cousin!
[00:40:21.487 --> 00:40:22.888]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:40:22.888 --> 00:40:24.929]  And she told me, and then I asked, I said, what's his father's name?
[00:40:24.929 --> 00:40:26.470]  And she said, Larry.
[00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:35.834]  And Larry Chertoff, there is a Larry Chertoff who is the Chief Economist for the New York Environmental Protection Agency, and he's concerned primarily with water.
[00:40:35.834 --> 00:40:38.435]  With the water that New Yorkers drink, and this and that.
[00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.116]  Now that's another issue in and of itself.
[00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:44.041]  But I believe that's probably his father, but I haven't confirmed that.
[00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.182]  But I want to tell you one thing.
[00:40:45.182 --> 00:40:48.764]  In this coast-to-coast radio show with Art Bell, there was an early caller.
[00:40:48.764 --> 00:41:00.173]  A caller called in from Pennsylvania, and she was very bright, and she asked the questions about the molten steel that I had found in the 7th basement level at the... They admitted it burned for weeks!
[00:41:00.173 --> 00:41:02.695]  Yeah, and this is something that's been confirmed.
[00:41:02.695 --> 00:41:03.876]  I was told by Peter Tully,
[00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:07.162]  From Tully Construction, one of the contractors who cleaned up the site.
[00:41:07.162 --> 00:41:13.984]  And it was confirmed by Mark Loiseau, who wrote the cleanup plan from Controlled Demolition Incorporated.
[00:41:13.984 --> 00:41:21.806]  And they discovered molten steel, in its molten state, when they dug down, when they scraped down and got down to the bedrock.
[00:41:21.806 --> 00:41:26.347]  Now this is very important, it's an oxygen starved environment, and you're finding molten steel.
[00:41:27.417 --> 00:41:30.519]  And the caller asked about this, and they had three hours.
[00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:33.641]  These guys, Chertoff and Art Bell, had three hours.
[00:41:33.641 --> 00:41:35.982]  They said they'd return to it, but they never discussed that.
[00:41:35.982 --> 00:41:36.963]  Well, let me be clear.
[00:41:36.963 --> 00:41:39.344]  Let me be clear on this.
[00:41:39.344 --> 00:41:41.466]  You saw people jumping out of the towers.
[00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:43.687]  That's right when the jet fuel hit and was still burning.
[00:41:43.687 --> 00:41:48.290]  Then it burned itself almost completely out in one of the towers to a great extent in the other tower.
[00:41:49.534 --> 00:41:56.559]  And then you have the photos of hundreds of people in the gaping holes, where the main fires were, standing there for 20 minutes.
[00:41:56.559 --> 00:42:07.206]  Now it doesn't melt their flesh, but it melts four foot around solid steel columns, reinforced steel, sprayed with asbestos as an insulating agent.
[00:42:08.084 --> 00:42:16.367]  Then suddenly, that's so hot it won't even melt your flesh, but it melts the steel, then it all falls, and then there's molten steel.
[00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:16.767]  Right.
[00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:20.268]  So again, common sense, folks.
[00:42:20.268 --> 00:42:21.849]  Common sense.
[00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:23.970]  And I want to do this now, and then we're going to go to some calls.
[00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.251]  I want to do this.
[00:42:26.251 --> 00:42:27.531]  Call them, be polite.
[00:42:27.531 --> 00:42:34.073]  The reason you're calling is because they've gone public and said all these things about us and about the investigation and what we're doing.
[00:42:34.073 --> 00:42:35.694]  You need to call them and say, look,
[00:42:36.408 --> 00:42:42.217]  Mr. Chertoff went on the air and said Mr. Jones, you know, can call in and defend himself, and he hasn't.
[00:42:42.217 --> 00:42:44.781]  Okay, and others can call in, but we haven't.
[00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:46.644]  As if you can call in on that show.
[00:42:46.644 --> 00:42:48.847]  The phones are jammed, there is no back number.
[00:42:48.847 --> 00:42:49.428]  Just made up.
[00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:51.903]  He wants to say all this.
[00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:52.504]  No.
[00:42:52.504 --> 00:42:54.464]  This is the open invitation.
[00:42:54.464 --> 00:43:03.487]  You put Mags, you put Chertoff, you put any of your clowns here on this show so we can dismantle what they're saying on our own time.
[00:43:03.487 --> 00:43:03.967]  Wow!
[00:43:03.967 --> 00:43:07.128]  We'll defend ourselves on our own little show compared to these big ones.
[00:43:07.128 --> 00:43:07.728]  Okay?
[00:43:07.728 --> 00:43:09.089]  Alex, one thing.
[00:43:09.852 --> 00:43:13.157]  In the South Tower, you remember that the firefighters got up to the 78th floor.
[00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:14.640]  I said the fires were almost out.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.421]  They were manageable.
[00:43:15.421 --> 00:43:16.423]  They were manageable.
[00:43:16.423 --> 00:43:20.710]  And so these secondary fires, that were supposedly burning it down... Two small fires, yeah.
[00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:21.151]  Exactly.
[00:43:22.057 --> 00:43:23.338]  And this has to be remembered.
[00:43:23.338 --> 00:43:24.839]  These fires were not in Inferno.
[00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.800]  Well, they burned themselves out, remember?
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.261]  Yes.
[00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:34.426]  But then we had, on February 12th of this year, we had a similar building burn for 24 hours in Madrid, Spain, and not collapse at all.
[00:43:34.426 --> 00:43:35.807]  You know, everybody keeps saying 24 hours.
[00:43:35.807 --> 00:43:37.528]  It really burned more than 24 hours.
[00:43:37.528 --> 00:43:38.469]  Yes, of course it did.
[00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:43.773]  But it was burning like a torch for 24 hours, and there was no collapse of the central columns.
[00:43:43.773 --> 00:43:45.514]  100-foot white flange.
[00:43:45.514 --> 00:43:46.955]  Yes.
[00:43:46.955 --> 00:43:50.818]  100-foot jetting, blasting white flange.
[00:43:51.804 --> 00:43:52.905]  And it's still standing.
[00:43:52.905 --> 00:43:53.525]  Still standing.
[00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:54.786]  Well, it had never happened before.
[00:43:54.786 --> 00:43:56.647]  And notice the media kept saying, it's going to collapse.
[00:43:56.647 --> 00:43:58.108]  It's going to collapse.
[00:43:58.108 --> 00:44:00.170]  Yes, that's 911 thinking for you.
[00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.091]  Okay, we were about to go to Randy, but he just hung up.
[00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:06.794]  Before we go to Randy, before we do that, I'm going to give these numbers out.
[00:44:06.794 --> 00:44:07.534]  Please call them.
[00:44:07.534 --> 00:44:12.037]  Be polite, because the poor person answering the phone, they're not part of this.
[00:44:12.037 --> 00:44:17.041]  But you need to let them know that we're very serious about this.
[00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:24.800]  You need, you know, Megs, their main editor, gets up there and says, we've disgraced the families, most of the families, I think the government did it, by the way.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.284]  They've stood up in 9-11 commission hearings and gotten in their face.
[00:44:29.284 --> 00:44:31.505]  They've been told to shut up or no money.
[00:44:31.505 --> 00:44:32.566]  Give them a call.
[00:44:32.566 --> 00:44:37.329]  Now, here, first off, ladies and gentlemen, is their fax number.
[00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:38.050]  Fax them.
[00:44:38.558 --> 00:44:38.758]  2-1-2-5-8-6-5-5-6-2.
[00:44:38.758 --> 00:44:39.018]  2-1-2-5-8-6-5-5-6-2.
[00:44:39.018 --> 00:44:40.820]  Give them a call.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.101]  Send them a fax right now.
[00:44:42.101 --> 00:44:42.301]  2-1-2-5-8-6-5-5-6-2.
[00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:44.482]  And also, give them a call on the phone.
[00:44:44.482 --> 00:44:46.664]  And tell them you want Meg's office.
[00:44:46.664 --> 00:44:48.565]  Tell them you want Chertoff's office.
[00:44:48.565 --> 00:44:51.287]  And again, I have been challenging them politely to come on the air.
[00:45:06.198 --> 00:45:08.379]  212-649-2000.
[00:45:08.379 --> 00:45:09.600]  Here's the phone number.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.601]  212-649-2000.
[00:45:11.601 --> 00:45:17.363]  You can call their subscription and cancel your subscription.
[00:45:17.363 --> 00:45:19.704]  If you've got a subscription, cancel it right now!
[00:45:19.704 --> 00:45:20.144]  800-333-4948.
[00:45:20.144 --> 00:45:21.325]  We're boycotting these people.
[00:45:21.325 --> 00:45:21.445]  800-333-4948.
[00:45:21.445 --> 00:45:26.487]  Give them a call on their regular office number and say they need to investigate Mr. Chertoff in conflict of interest.
[00:45:35.898 --> 00:45:36.478]  212-649-2000.
[00:45:36.478 --> 00:45:36.979]  212-649-2000.
[00:45:36.979 --> 00:45:45.222]  Give them a call.
[00:45:45.222 --> 00:45:48.484]  Their website is popularmechanics.com.
[00:45:48.484 --> 00:45:53.126]  They've now launched a blog with nothing but positive comments supposedly from bloggers.
[00:45:53.126 --> 00:45:55.066]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:45:55.066 --> 00:45:56.227]  Go in there and test this.
[00:45:56.767 --> 00:46:00.929]  Write your own comments, see if they'll deal with it.
[00:46:00.929 --> 00:46:01.770]  212-649-2000.
[00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:02.610]  Ask them!
[00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.350]  Letter to the editor.
[00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:11.955]  Are you going to retract the fact that you say one blame was intercepted in the ten years before 9-11, when you're very experts in the Associated Press and 68 times in the year before 9-11?
[00:46:11.955 --> 00:46:12.175]  212-649-2000 or 800-333-4948.
[00:46:12.175 --> 00:46:12.255]  800-333-4948.
[00:46:12.255 --> 00:46:13.996]  Please take action.
[00:46:25.689 --> 00:46:27.770]  Randy hung up, so let's talk to John in New York.
[00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.950]  John, thanks for holding.
[00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:29.850]  Oh, thank you.
[00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.011]  Hey, just one thing.
[00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:44.894]  I had a farm show in our area that has people come in and I set up a booth for, it cost me $500, but I put up the 9-11 information and the Energy 9 crisis and the 200 mile per gallon carburetor and the Planet X and all that kind of information.
[00:46:44.894 --> 00:46:46.294]  Anyhow, they got said and done.
[00:46:46.294 --> 00:46:53.196]  I had one gentleman come up and he couldn't say that they dropped a nuclear bomb in Iraq, but he said, you know, we killed 20,000 Iraqis with one bomb.
[00:46:53.196 --> 00:46:54.476]  And he said, when I got to the bomb site,
[00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:58.173]  He said it was all glass.
[00:46:58.173 --> 00:47:03.135]  Well, that's like the General said, that the Republican Guard disappeared.
[00:47:03.135 --> 00:47:07.538]  And, Sonny, he didn't really come out and say miles, but he was indicating it.
[00:47:07.538 --> 00:47:11.060]  Also, just in reference, a couple things.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.121]  They're trying to split us to break us up.
[00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:17.123]  And not only are we being broken up, but so are the Chinese and so are the Russians.
[00:47:17.123 --> 00:47:22.286]  I mean, the one report that's out on the Russians is that one Russian captain stopped a nuclear
[00:47:22.876 --> 00:47:24.658]  Attack during the Cold Wars.
[00:47:24.658 --> 00:47:30.983]  There's good people over there also, and that'll be aware of that, we're aware of that, and that they need Pete's to stop these warlord-er people.
[00:47:30.983 --> 00:47:39.130]  Also, the people that are being, uh, such as they had the collapse in the, uh, oh, um, yeah.
[00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:39.630]  Okay.
[00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.492]  The National Geographic show, where they collapsed the towers.
[00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:46.015]  They said, oh, we had two of our own National Geographic people die in that plane.
[00:47:46.015 --> 00:47:48.898]  Well, they had the congressmen be poisoned with anthrax.
[00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:59.371]  They had a congressional announcement by Roderiger out of California saying that they know that 9-11 was happening, that Catalina Rice would refuse to stop it.
[00:47:59.371 --> 00:48:04.072]  Those things do exist and they are killing their own people, so people that are hiding this for them.
[00:48:04.072 --> 00:48:10.673]  Also, they were saying that the planes were in the background of the 9-11 attacks, there was jets in the background, so they were assisting.
[00:48:10.673 --> 00:48:11.793]  No, that's not true.
[00:48:11.793 --> 00:48:13.974]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:16.014]  Jim in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.587]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:48:17.587 --> 00:48:23.390]  I was just calling too, but, you know, Saturday night, just another episode of All in the Family here in the United States of Nepotism.
[00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:31.133]  I can't believe, well, maybe I should, that Ardell finally sold out, because I think he did when he wanted to get his movie produced.
[00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:43.398]  And just one fact that I want to bring up about all this, and, you know, they want to call people that have the conspiracy facts, they want to call us conspiracy theorists and kooks, yet they're willing to believe
[00:48:44.016 --> 00:48:47.838]  As Chertoff said, a hundred-ton plane can disintegrate when it hits the Pentagon.
[00:48:47.838 --> 00:48:48.198]  Right.
[00:48:48.198 --> 00:48:53.401]  Yet Mohammed Adda's passport can be found three, four blocks away from the World Trade Center in almost pristine condition.
[00:48:53.401 --> 00:49:01.466]  And that a man in a cave could have NORAD shut down, run CIA drills that morning, and have all these jets fly into buildings with total precision.
[00:49:01.466 --> 00:49:06.689]  That was just another pacification show for all the suckers who want to believe the 9-11 story from the government.
[00:49:07.774 --> 00:49:09.134]  All right, Tim, thanks for the call.
[00:49:09.134 --> 00:49:10.795]  Well, look, my problem isn't even with Bell.
[00:49:10.795 --> 00:49:11.895]  Bell can do what he wants.
[00:49:11.895 --> 00:49:15.256]  I appreciate George Norrie having me on, and that's an important venue.
[00:49:15.256 --> 00:49:17.617]  The problem here is Chertoff.
[00:49:17.617 --> 00:49:18.037]  Right.
[00:49:18.037 --> 00:49:19.878]  And his ilk.
[00:49:19.878 --> 00:49:21.859]  Comments to that, Mr. Boland?
[00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:35.343]  Yeah, I wanted to say that my opinion, I wrote an open letter to the 9-1-1 investigators in 2002, and I take a very harsh position of people who are involved in the cover-up of this mass murder in New York City and Washington.
[00:49:36.445 --> 00:49:49.294]  People who are involved in either obfuscating or preventing the investigation of this 9-1-1, or who then, like Benjamin Chertoff, take part in a propaganda effort to conceal what really happened.
[00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:53.850]  I find them to be of the ilk of the people who perpetrated this attack.
[00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.151]  Well I've only heard a little bit of the interview now this morning.
[00:49:57.151 --> 00:50:00.851]  This is three hours and I was out of town and didn't find out until yesterday afternoon.
[00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:04.492]  But everybody I've talked to says he was just a bumbling idiot.
[00:50:04.492 --> 00:50:05.793]  Well he wasn't so bad.
[00:50:05.793 --> 00:50:06.933]  It was four hours long.
[00:50:06.933 --> 00:50:09.233]  It started, it was four hours long.
[00:50:09.233 --> 00:50:13.934]  And they got into it big time after about 45 minutes into the show.
[00:50:13.934 --> 00:50:15.495]  That's when they pulled out my open letter.
[00:50:17.125 --> 00:50:19.826]  No, he wasn't so bad, but he's not a scientist.
[00:50:19.826 --> 00:50:22.767]  He's not a scientist, and he doesn't answer the questions.
[00:50:22.767 --> 00:50:27.770]  One of the main questions that I always pose to people is what happened to the central columns?
[00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:32.211]  The World Trade Center towers were held up by 47 huge central columns.
[00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:33.872]  What caused them to fall?
[00:50:33.872 --> 00:50:37.774]  There's no explanation presented anywhere to explain why they fell.
[00:50:37.774 --> 00:50:42.436]  And because they were the central columns that held up the gravity weight, the gravity load of the building,
[00:50:42.976 --> 00:50:48.825]  Without cutting those... We have the designer of the building saying to take multiple jet hits.
[00:50:48.825 --> 00:50:52.710]  We have the underwriters going public saying it's all a fraud.
[00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.715]  Mr. Ryan, I mean, it's just ridiculous, folks.
[00:50:55.715 --> 00:50:56.436]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.296 --> 00:51:07.458]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:07.458 --> 00:51:09.019]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.019 --> 00:51:11.379]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:11.379 --> 00:51:13.740]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[00:51:19.022 --> 00:51:23.043]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[00:51:25.145 --> 00:51:35.958]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:35.958 --> 00:51:38.061]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:13.519]  Central time.
[00:54:13.519 --> 00:54:15.020]  Give Popular Mechanics a call.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.423]  And remember, most of them are writing about cars and plants and cell phones.
[00:54:19.423 --> 00:54:20.944]  They're not evil.
[00:54:20.944 --> 00:54:21.504]  Okay?
[00:54:21.504 --> 00:54:22.745]  So don't be mean to them.
[00:54:22.745 --> 00:54:26.107]  Just call up and be serious and say, we want them to come on and debate.
[00:54:26.107 --> 00:54:30.750]  And stop your subscription until... Because they're calling us liars and evil.
[00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:31.751]  They're the ones that hit us.
[00:54:32.415 --> 00:54:32.535]  212-649-2000.
[00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:32.695]  212-649-2000.

[00:54:50.616 --> 00:54:52.077]  Real quick, Brooke in Rhode Island.
[00:54:52.077 --> 00:54:53.797]  Brooke, go ahead.
[00:54:53.797 --> 00:54:56.218]  I'm guessing you might disagree with this, so I'm putting you on first.
[00:54:56.218 --> 00:54:56.958]  Go ahead.
[00:54:56.958 --> 00:54:57.738]  Hello, Alex.
[00:54:57.738 --> 00:54:59.399]  It's so good to hear your voice.
[00:54:59.399 --> 00:54:59.679]  You bet.
[00:54:59.679 --> 00:55:02.500]  Do you say you have a family with Popular Mechanics?
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:10.482]  I have friends who worked for 10 years at Popular Mechanics up until this summer when they were fired.
[00:55:11.138 --> 00:55:12.839]  Yeah, I heard they got a whole new crew in there.
[00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:23.085]  They brought in a whole new crew, and to tell you the truth, Alex, all the people that I knew at Popular Mechanics, they were in their office on the morning of 9-11.
[00:55:23.085 --> 00:55:25.867]  They saw the planes flying into New York.
[00:55:25.867 --> 00:55:32.011]  They saw the black helicopters that many people consider conspiracy theory and wacko.
[00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:33.552]  They saw everything.
[00:55:33.552 --> 00:55:37.554]  Can you get your friends in contact with Mr. Bohlen?
[00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:39.976]  It'd be great to have former riders there talking about it.
[00:55:40.496 --> 00:55:43.297]  Alex, they haven't even gotten unemployment.
[00:55:43.297 --> 00:55:53.639]  They were told at five o'clock on Thursday to clear everything out of your office by five o'clock Friday and do not return or you will be escorted out by security.
[00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:56.239]  Okay, contact Christopher at his office.
[00:55:56.239 --> 00:55:58.199]  I do know they had a big shake-up there.
[00:55:58.199 --> 00:56:00.720]  Absolutely, and then Chertoff was brought in.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.721]  But the other thing I want to quickly ask you is have you heard about the murder of Edward
[00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:10.164]  I just saw the movie that you just put out.
[00:56:10.164 --> 00:56:15.787]  I saw it on yourprisonerplanet.tv and I thought it was an awesome film.
[00:56:33.444 --> 00:56:48.194]  The thing that I don't want to know, and I've been emailing and I haven't gotten an answer back yet, is I'd like to get a couple of thousand of these, and I'm wondering if you can put a questionnaire out to see how many other hundreds of callers would like to buy a thousand of these tapes or DVDs.
[00:56:48.194 --> 00:56:49.935]  Let me tell you the number to do that.
[00:56:49.935 --> 00:56:50.656]  Call this number.
[00:56:50.656 --> 00:56:51.316]  512-291-5750 for bulk orders.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.825]  291-5750, or call the toll free number, they can give you that number if you missed it.
[00:57:03.825 --> 00:57:04.585]  Alright, very good.
[00:57:04.585 --> 00:57:11.932]  And you know, I've been doing my part with this Popular Mechanics, I've been putting deception dollars in every one I can find.
[00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:19.979]  And the other thing is, I'm hoping that I can maybe get your weekly updates on a DVD for my public access show as well.
[00:57:20.692 --> 00:57:23.173]  And, um, I'd like to find out about that.
[00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:28.056]  Now, can I ask your bulk order line about that, or is that something... No, I don't offer that at this time.
[00:57:28.056 --> 00:57:29.636]  It's just on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:29.636 --> 00:57:30.457]  Listen, I'm out of time.
[00:57:30.457 --> 00:57:31.357]  God bless you.
[00:57:31.357 --> 00:57:32.518]  Please get a bunch of the videos.
[00:57:32.518 --> 00:57:33.899]  Yes, we want distributors.
[00:57:33.899 --> 00:57:37.220]  I want to thank you, Christopher Bolin, writes for American Free Press, for coming on.
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.761]  We've got links to American Free Press and InfoWars.com.

[00:57:40.602 --> 00:57:40.942]  Thank you.
[00:57:40.942 --> 00:57:41.762]  Keep up the good work.
[00:57:41.762 --> 00:57:42.203]  Thank you.
[00:57:42.203 --> 00:57:42.603]  Take care.
[00:57:42.603 --> 00:57:42.883]  Bye-bye.
[00:57:43.462 --> 00:57:48.187]  Alright, I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, speaking of the new film, it's out, two and a half hours long, my best work.
[00:57:48.187 --> 00:57:54.835]  You can order it via InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, a hard copy, or call toll free and make copies of it, get it out to people, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139,

[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.982]  And ask them if they know that Chertoff is at Cousins with the Homeland Security Director.
[00:58:31.295 --> 00:58:36.921]  Serious conflict of interest in light of all this stuff that's been coming out about the nature of the controlled press.
[00:58:36.921 --> 00:58:41.906]  Again, the number to get my films, 888-253-3139.
[00:58:41.906 --> 00:58:44.689]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, standing up for the truth.
