[00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:11.046]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:12.527]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:14.148]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:23.095]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.570]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.171]  Thank you so much for joining us live on this Tuesday edition.
[00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:47.792]  The 29th day of March 2005.
[00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:53.214]  We'll be live for the next three hours right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:57.655]  And we're going to take a lot of your phone calls in this first hour.
[00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:02.356]  I know many of you are chomping at the bit to talk about the Terri Schiavo Schindler case.
[00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:06.037]  As she is clearly in her last days.
[00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:08.177]  Or end of days.
[00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:12.160]  Not long for this world, as they say.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.802]  A true travesty of justice.
[00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:20.046]  A true public execution and torture.
[00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:22.568]  It is truly brutal.
[00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:27.952]  Also, we'll be talking about the huge earthquake yesterday.
[00:01:27.972 --> 00:01:30.053]  They first said it was an 8.3.
[00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.855]  By the end of the day it was an 8.7 and hundreds are dead.
[00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:44.818]  On top of all of this, the Times of London is reporting depressed Kofi Annan close to quitting over UN scandals.
[00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.262]  And who's waiting in the wings?
[00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:49.945]  Bill Clinton!
[00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:52.269]  William Jefferson Clinton!
[00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.653]  And we've got Wolfie Wits, clearly going to be our new World Bank head.
[00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:03.557]  They're putting in the little neocons left and right.
[00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:08.061]  And by neocons, Bill Clinton was for the war in Serbia, the neocon idea.
[00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:11.303]  Bill Clinton is all for the Iraq war.
[00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:22.092]  And George Bush has been protecting him all along, blocking release of documents, ordering Congress, which I didn't think the executive could do, to not investigate Clinton.
[00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.942]  So we'll get into the geopolitical landscape and what it's shaping up.
[00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:30.703]  Ebola-like virus deaths in Angola.
[00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:35.244]  A rising travel warning issued.
[00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:40.445]  That'll be very serious if any of that stuff ever spreads over here.
[00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:51.848]  And we'll get into not just the earthquake yesterday, but how earthquakes are at record levels in recorded history right now.
[00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:59.209]  We've had two of the biggest earthquakes in recorded history just in the last four months.
[00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:01.790]  Less than four months.
[00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:10.735]  And at the same time, there's a whole bunch of new developments concerning Terry Schiavo.
[00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:22.914]  Terry's demonstrating her will to live, follow the Constitution, Governor Bush, grant clemency to Terry Schiavo Schindler.
[00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:34.564]  At the same time, different law enforcement groups are calling for a criminal investigation and a freeze on the dehydration and murder of Terry Schiavo Schindler.
[00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:51.234]  But as we learned over the weekend, they were already sending state police to rescue her, but the little Pinellas Park police said they were going to have a standoff with them and even joked how many of us can hold off the National Guard, and Jeb Bush did absolutely nothing.
[00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:54.297]  He can pardon drug dealers.
[00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:58.754]  His brother can pardon drug dealers and murderers.
[00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:02.037]  Bill Clinton can do it, but we can't do it for this woman.
[00:04:02.637 --> 00:04:10.163]  And it's been said a thousand times, I'll say it again, you can't execute an axe murderer the way they're executing Terry.
[00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:13.486]  And I've heard so much incredible spin.
[00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:23.034]  The Associated Press is reporting that, oh, she's being cared for and treated at the hospital, and she's only had her food taken away.
[00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:24.084]  Well, no.
[00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:26.146]  She's had her food and water taken away.
[00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.087]  And she's not being cared for.
[00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:29.628]  She's being murdered.
[00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:32.350]  So stop redefining reality.
[00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.191]  Stop editing reality.
[00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:40.675]  Stop engaging in these semantical frauds.
[00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:46.619]  There is so much other key news and information coming up.
[00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.500]  We have a big guest in the second hour.
[00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:54.235]  He so happens to be a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:57.117]  He'll be talking about torture with us.
[00:04:57.957 --> 00:04:59.018]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:04:59.078 --> 00:04:59.639]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:03.069]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.331]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:10.374]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:14.657]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:18.780]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.721]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.223]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:05:24.263 --> 00:05:28.966]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:32.167]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:32.347 --> 00:05:35.209]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:41.813]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.353 --> 00:05:46.136]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:47.937]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.317 --> 00:05:49.318]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:51.339]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:06:00.686 --> 00:06:02.268]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:08.395]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:13.801]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:16.484]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove
[00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:17.025]  We're good to go!
[00:06:38.388 --> 00:06:44.351]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:50.854]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:50.894 --> 00:06:51.875]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:52.855]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.568 --> 00:07:07.069]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.310]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.290]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.251]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:17.312]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:18.672]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:21.693]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:22.073 --> 00:07:25.774]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:07:25.914 --> 00:07:26.094]  Look.
[00:07:26.294 --> 00:07:28.597]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:33.502]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:36.906]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:42.452]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:07:42.532 --> 00:07:43.293]  Try No-BO.
[00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:44.394]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:48.457]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[00:07:48.637 --> 00:07:51.519]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:54.221]  Check out their website at no-b-o.com.
[00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:57.623]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O.
[00:07:57.803 --> 00:07:59.424]  That's no-b-o.com.
[00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:09.531]  Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:13.113]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.277 --> 00:08:24.838]  Alright, second segment.
[00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.061]  Eight minutes, twenty-five seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:29.882 --> 00:08:31.123]  That confuses some people.
[00:08:31.163 --> 00:08:32.184]  They say, second segment?
[00:08:32.204 --> 00:08:33.124]  We just tuned in to you.
[00:08:33.144 --> 00:08:34.305]  We were just listening to the news.
[00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:37.407]  I think it's fine if our affiliates carry the news.
[00:08:39.689 --> 00:08:45.993]  But to be quite frank with you folks, we cover the real news in the first five minutes of each hour.
[00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:52.158]  We cover a lot more news than you hear on most of these news feeds on the different
[00:08:53.062 --> 00:08:54.222]  different networks out there.
[00:08:54.322 --> 00:09:01.984]  Some of the broadcasts on our network choose to have news play before their shows and that's their prerogative.
[00:09:02.944 --> 00:09:15.908]  But I choose to not have it because more of our stations do want that first little five-minute segment and they opt out of the supposed news and just get it here.
[00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:21.629]  So we are into our second segment now and I do have a Council on Foreign Relations member
[00:09:22.364 --> 00:09:36.433]  His book is published by the Council on Foreign Relations, that organization openly calling for world government, with most prominent members of academia, finance, government, media, the arts being members of it.
[00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:43.577]  And this member of the CFR has written a book that I agree with, against torture.
[00:09:43.597 --> 00:09:51.802]  And so we're going to be having him on to talk about torture, and who knows, maybe a little bit about the CFR.
[00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:57.554]  Because the CFR, of course, does have its token good members in it.
[00:09:58.314 --> 00:10:05.117]  I guess kind of for PR purposes, but this is an interview you do not want to miss coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:10:05.777 --> 00:10:08.198]  Well, at the start of the next hour, in the middle of the broadcast.
[00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:13.321]  The middle third of this transmission against tyranny.
[00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:15.742]  Boy, I tell you, I'm awake now.
[00:10:16.902 --> 00:10:20.864]  I had just gotten some coffee kind of late in the morning.
[00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:38.486]  I had it sitting up here on my broadcast desk and for some reason was grabbing at some papers under the stack and knocked the whole giant brimming container that I just got at the Rockefeller Exxon into my lap.
[00:10:40.354 --> 00:10:42.115]  I was up late working last night.
[00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:47.201]  I did the Jeff Rents radio program and then did about three hours of research after that.
[00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:48.762]  So I went to sleep about 3 a.m.
[00:10:49.323 --> 00:10:53.427]  Still got up pretty early this morning, but never got around to making any coffee.
[00:10:53.947 --> 00:10:57.071]  So when I left the house and went to the office, I pulled in and got some coffee.
[00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:08.006]  Just a few minutes after I had gotten into the studio, in the middle of that last break, spilt it into my lap, so I am, I think, more awake now than if I would have drunk that coffee.
[00:11:09.387 --> 00:11:12.609]  Alright, enough with the mindless issues.
[00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:15.530]  I don't think you tune in to hear me talk about coffee, do you?
[00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:22.354]  Bill in Ireland, and Kenneth in Louisiana, James in North Carolina, Johnny in Canada, John in Texas,
[00:11:23.004 --> 00:11:24.745]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.606]  I want to do things a little bit different today.
[00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:29.407]  I normally go to calls about 30 minutes into the broadcast.
[00:11:29.427 --> 00:11:32.028]  We're just going to go to your calls basically immediately.
[00:11:32.048 --> 00:11:43.534]  And then I'll get into depressed Annan, that's Coffee Annan, for those educated in the government training camps, close to quitting over UN scandals.
[00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:49.620]  And a lot of our conservative listeners are probably saying, hooray, hip-hip, hooray!
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:58.368]  I mean, Kofi Annan's involved in white slavery rings, Kofi Annan's involved in bid-rigging and scamming and UN food for oil frauds.
[00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:00.049]  He's horrible!
[00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.652]  Sex orgies at the UN.
[00:12:03.953 --> 00:12:04.533]  He's horrible.
[00:12:04.553 --> 00:12:05.374]  They're all horrible.
[00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:11.660]  He's a lot better, though, than Kurt Voltheim, the SS officer who hunted down American soldiers and killed them.
[00:12:12.507 --> 00:12:14.488]  He's like a demon compared to Satan.
[00:12:15.228 --> 00:12:18.570]  Yes, he's of hell, but is he the worst?
[00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:24.553]  Of course, there really is no lesser of two evils, so it's all part and parcel of the same flock of blackbirds.
[00:12:28.067 --> 00:12:33.149]  At the same time, we have Kofi Annan talking about leaving, and Bill Clinton's lined up.
[00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:38.272]  He's got six of the G8, excuse me, seven of the G8 lined up.
[00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:45.495]  It's been in major publications for four years that Lord Clinton wants to be Secretary General, and it's the U.S.'
[00:12:45.455 --> 00:12:45.995]  's turn.
[00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.756]  The U.S.
[00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:50.657]  has never had a Secretary General.
[00:12:52.878 --> 00:12:55.940]  Never had a Secretary General, and so
[00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:59.828]  We're going to get into why this is shaping up to happen.
[00:13:00.969 --> 00:13:05.790]  Of course, Ebola-like virus deaths rise in Angola.
[00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.291]  Travel warning issued.
[00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:18.455]  Hundreds died in the Indonesian quake that was an 8.7 right in the same area as the quake that killed hundreds of thousands via tsunamis back on the 26th of December.
[00:13:20.482 --> 00:13:27.949]  And hundreds are confirmed dead, they're saying thousands may have died, but not from rising water this time, but from collapsing buildings.
[00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:33.254]  In some areas, some of the islands that were hit by quakes, the quake went on for six minutes!
[00:13:35.556 --> 00:13:42.422]  The question is, is this a precursor to something larger, volcanic and tectonic activity?
[00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:52.269]  Alright folks, it's Alex Jones and it is Friday, the first day of this new month, April.
[00:13:53.229 --> 00:13:55.671]  And no, this is not April Fools.
[00:13:56.611 --> 00:14:00.614]  The network is unable to connect to any of its talk show hosts.
[00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:03.742]  that are in Texas via the digital lines.
[00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:12.227]  I don't want to say it's a conspiracy, but we're going to try to get this fixed so I can give you a live broadcast on this Friday.
[00:14:12.247 --> 00:14:21.051]  This happens a few times a year, though it's interesting that it's just Texas that is affected from the Home Office of Minnesota cannot connect.
[00:14:22.232 --> 00:14:25.514]  But there's so much news that needs to be covered.
[00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:29.316]  If I don't go live today, we don't get it fixed on this Friday edition.
[00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:36.861]  Don't worry, we're going to have a CFR member on talking about torture and the interview from a few days ago that a lot of folks missed.
[00:14:36.901 --> 00:14:40.202]  I've been requesting Jim Tucker about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:40.962 --> 00:14:44.103]  That is going to play in the third hour.
[00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:46.324]  So two great interviews coming up.
[00:14:46.504 --> 00:14:57.428]  Or if we get this fixed, I'll be live and in stereo for you folks instead of sitting here walking around the studio via a cell phone.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.221]  A few of the news items that just have got to be covered.
[00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:03.182]  Oil prices may see super spike.
[00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:12.946]  Crude oil prices rose on Friday after a leading investment bank and energy markets trader said the prices could eventually top $100 a barrel.
[00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:19.489]  And if that happened, you'd be paying about $4 a gallon, my friends.
[00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:24.871]  Also, the Pope has had his last rites after heart failure this morning.
[00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:29.800]  Rome, the condition of Pope John Paul II was very grave.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:36.023]  The Vatican said Friday morning, and he had been given last rites for suffering cardiovascular collapse.
[00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:38.585]  That's the quote from the Vatican on Thursday.
[00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.567]  But the Pope, 84, whose health has taken a steep dive in the past two months,
[00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:49.591]  Decided himself not to go to the hospital, and on Friday morning he was still conscious, lucid, and tranquil.
[00:15:50.091 --> 00:16:04.259]  His chief spokesman, Jacqueline Navarro-Vowles, said in a statement he was being treated in the chambers by a team of doctors that includes intensive care specialists and a cardiologist.
[00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:12.262]  His assistant said in a statement, the Pope's apartment is now equipped with complete and efficient health facilities.
[00:16:12.402 --> 00:16:19.905]  It continued, the statement did not indicate specifically if the Pope had suffered a heart attack or some other form of cardiovascular failure.
[00:16:19.965 --> 00:16:23.787]  The latest crisis, a day after his doctors treated him with a feeding tube,
[00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:38.453]  was set off Thursday by a urinary tract infection, which the Vatican said had caused a high fever and plummeting blood pressure in the already frail Pope, who has been suffering for more than a decade from Parkinson's disease.
[00:16:38.973 --> 00:16:48.338]  So, Pope John Paul II is not doing well, and if he does die, this is going to be a big deal, whoever this new Pope is, regardless of the fact if you're Catholic or not.
[00:16:48.978 --> 00:16:53.341]  I'm not Catholic, but there's 40 million Catholics in America, hundreds of millions worldwide,
[00:16:54.102 --> 00:16:55.623]  I don't know, what is it, 800, 900 million?
[00:16:55.643 --> 00:16:57.764]  I don't want to speak out of turn on that.
[00:16:57.904 --> 00:16:59.164]  I'm not sure of the exact numbers.
[00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:06.248]  But whoever this next pope is, it's going to be a big deal for world politics.
[00:17:07.228 --> 00:17:13.731]  Also, Bush was on TV yesterday saying, yeah, the CIA screwed up.
[00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:19.134]  This is why we've got to have more power and bigger agencies and let me reform everything, i.e.
[00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:19.754]  take over
[00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:23.900]  More of a takeover by the people that told the lies.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:32.986]  Dick Cheney went to the CIA, ordered them to put out these assessments, ordered them to lie, and then now they blame them for following their orders.
[00:17:33.046 --> 00:17:36.428]  It's like they ordered the people at these camps to torture.
[00:17:36.509 --> 00:17:46.956]  We have the memos from the now Attorney General, then one of the Chief Councils of the White House, Alberto Gonzalez, saying, yes, we're torturing people, but it's not torture if we don't mean to kill them.
[00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:52.730]  You know, all this weird double-speak, and then people go to prison, but not the government that gave the orders to do it.
[00:17:52.770 --> 00:18:01.958]  That's like if a Mafia Don orders somebody to go kill someone, and then everybody admits the Mafia Don gave the order, but when they bust the hitman, the Mafia Don doesn't get in trouble.
[00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:12.186]  So, out of a crisis, out of a lie Bush tells, and Bumsfeld and the rest of them tell, along with the Democrats, they then spin this
[00:18:12.916 --> 00:18:32.187]  Into C, we need more power and control, and even bigger intelligence agencies, and now they've got, from the Iran-Contra fame, and the Negroponte, John Negroponte, the chief head of all intelligence, Porter Goss, who helped cover up 9-11, and clearly was involved at certain levels, is now the CIA director.
[00:18:33.808 --> 00:18:36.590]  Chertoff, who was involved in cover-ups, is now Homeland Security head.
[00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.551]  They're putting all their people in place.
[00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:43.028]  And none of this anti-terror funding has anything to do with terrorism.
[00:18:43.348 --> 00:18:45.049]  Plus, there's another article here I have.
[00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:47.871]  The Pentagon is saying that, yes, they're going to need a draft.
[00:18:48.671 --> 00:18:53.234]  And that article is on PrisonPlanet.com and TheInfoWars.com.
[00:18:53.694 --> 00:18:57.236]  We're going to go back to this rebroadcast and then into those interviews.
[00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:58.416]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:18:59.017 --> 00:19:02.839]  Again, my heart goes out to Terry Shivo Schindler.
[00:19:03.639 --> 00:19:08.662]  And it's just, the more I research this case, the more despicable what happens.
[00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:10.410]  I think so.
[00:19:27.803 --> 00:19:29.684]  And in the third hour.
[00:19:30.124 --> 00:19:32.225]  So again, please stay with us.
[00:19:32.765 --> 00:19:35.266]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:37.087]  And don't forget my new film, Martial Law.
[00:19:37.107 --> 00:19:39.868]  9-11 Rise of the Police State has now been released.
[00:19:39.948 --> 00:19:41.549]  It's out on DVD.
[00:19:42.129 --> 00:19:42.830]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.652]  Next time I'm talking about somebody who's begging for food and water who can actually talk.
[00:19:48.732 --> 00:19:50.113]  Honey, can I please have some water?
[00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:51.693]  No, you're gonna die.
[00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.054]  The Bioethics Board says so.
[00:19:54.719 --> 00:19:57.142]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just one of the websites.
[00:19:57.702 --> 00:19:58.863]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:20:01.146 --> 00:20:05.410]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.751]  The real money folks.
[00:20:10.055 --> 00:20:11.956]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:13.358]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.847]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:20.750]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:27.217]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[00:20:27.317 --> 00:20:30.541]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:31.302 --> 00:20:32.463]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:20:32.483 --> 00:20:33.384]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:40.563]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:21:10.376 --> 00:21:21.659]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:24.520]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.961]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:21:29.161 --> 00:21:31.324]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:31.464 --> 00:21:33.367]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:39.575]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:39.835 --> 00:21:45.503]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:08.392]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:22:09.652 --> 00:22:13.694]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:14.429 --> 00:22:21.472]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:22:22.352 --> 00:22:31.115]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[00:23:01.777 --> 00:23:05.478]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:23:05.758 --> 00:23:06.899]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[00:23:06.979 --> 00:23:11.980]  I was having a hard time breathing and I had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.581]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:17.602]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:23:17.622 --> 00:23:18.122]  Cardivite.
[00:23:18.202 --> 00:23:18.662]  Cardivite.
[00:23:18.722 --> 00:23:20.243]  We all use Cardivite!
[00:23:21.124 --> 00:23:24.605]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[00:23:40.948 --> 00:23:41.228]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:56.294]  I'll say this, the social architects thought that they would use the Terry Schindler case
[00:24:21.451 --> 00:24:29.215]  To train us to accept the torture and execution of people that are paralyzed.
[00:24:29.775 --> 00:24:31.295]  But it's going to blow up in their face.
[00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:44.701]  If Terry dies from the abuse they've been inflicting on her, if it continues much longer, she will be a martyr for the right to life and pro-life movement.
[00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:47.703]  John in Texas, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[00:24:48.023 --> 00:24:48.343]  Hi Alex.
[00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:49.904]  Can you hear me?
[00:24:51.061 --> 00:24:56.585]  You know, when the Romans used to nail a guy to the cross to crucify him, it wasn't a nail that killed him.
[00:24:56.605 --> 00:24:59.607]  It was the lack of food, water, and his organs were shut down.
[00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:01.608]  And it was a cruel death, and they knew it.
[00:25:01.648 --> 00:25:02.469]  That's why they did it.
[00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:05.190]  So it sort of looks like we're living in a new Rome, don't it?
[00:25:07.112 --> 00:25:13.296]  Well, actually, what killed you was suffocation, generally, because you couldn't support
[00:25:14.142 --> 00:25:41.416]  uh... your diaphragm because you were hanging by your arms and that's why people were still alive usually uh... after five or six hours the romans would break your legs because sometimes people could still partially support themselves and give their diaphragm purchase they'll hold themselves up but uh... you're right it was a very cruel form of torture and it's ranked right up there with that as far as I'm concerned when they slowly start somebody up like that and uh...
[00:25:41.972 --> 00:25:43.433]  And it won't give them any kind of treatment or nothing.
[00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:45.034]  It ranks up there with crucifixion.
[00:25:45.254 --> 00:25:46.835]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:25:47.075 --> 00:25:55.981]  And they use a very sophisticated, lawyer-like, semantical spin when they say, well, she's going to feel euphoria.
[00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:57.222]  And it's true.
[00:25:57.322 --> 00:26:05.027]  Right before you go into a coma, generally, from dehydration, you will feel euphoric for a few minutes, a few hours.
[00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:08.889]  But we're talking about days and weeks of torture before that.
[00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:10.070]  So it's all semantical.
[00:26:14.443 --> 00:26:20.986]  I know another trick that the Romans had was they used to take Christian babies and hang them from a long pole in the arena and let starving hyenas tear them apart.
[00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:26.049]  Well that's true, but the Christians were with Al Qaeda though.
[00:26:26.963 --> 00:26:28.144]  We have to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:28.485 --> 00:26:35.851]  But if you read what's been going on in these abortion clinics with these partial birth abortions, especially where two-legged Irene is ripping them apart, I don't see any difference.
[00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:37.412]  I just don't like the way this country's going.
[00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:44.238]  Yep, hundreds of thousands of babies a year that could be adopted, no reason to kill them in the late third trimester.
[00:26:44.258 --> 00:26:45.259]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:45.760]  I hear ya.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.381]  Johnny in Canada.
[00:26:47.441 --> 00:26:48.202]  Johnny, welcome.
[00:26:48.826 --> 00:26:49.607]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:26:49.687 --> 00:26:50.728]  Good, sir.
[00:26:50.848 --> 00:27:01.396]  I took a little vacation this weekend to visit some family for Easter, and I took a drive up the highway up here in B.C., and what I saw was, I don't know, it was weird.
[00:27:01.416 --> 00:27:10.864]  It was about 50 or 60 military, probably Canadian trucks that were coming down the highway at different times, and they had
[00:27:11.889 --> 00:27:13.730]  It's weird what they look like.
[00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:22.055]  I don't know if they were Russian or Dutch flags flying from parts of the truck, just like tied to them, kind of like a little flag.
[00:27:22.395 --> 00:27:33.221]  Well, there's always a lot of foreign troops doing maneuvers here in the United States, especially in the South and Southwest, but I don't know about what's going on up in Canada.
[00:27:33.701 --> 00:27:34.181]  Well, I don't know.
[00:27:34.221 --> 00:27:39.524]  I found it kind of weird until I saw a little something on resistancemanifesto.com
[00:27:39.969 --> 00:27:43.371]  Which talks about concentration camps, right?
[00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:52.756]  And on one of their little flag show things, I see this enemy prisoner of war compound sign, which is, I guess, a concentration camp.
[00:27:53.457 --> 00:27:56.299]  And on one of these pictures is this flag.
[00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:58.280]  Blue, white, and red.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.321]  I don't know what that means.
[00:28:00.981 --> 00:28:02.622]  Well, I'll have to check that out.
[00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:04.703]  I appreciate the call, Johnny.
[00:28:05.324 --> 00:28:08.145]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[00:28:08.406 --> 00:28:09.086]  Kenneth, welcome.
[00:28:10.413 --> 00:28:11.253]  Hello there, Alex.
[00:28:11.654 --> 00:28:12.114]  Hello, sir.
[00:28:12.334 --> 00:28:13.314]  How we doing today?
[00:28:13.595 --> 00:28:16.816]  Doing a radio broadcast and talking to you, so I'm doing pretty good.
[00:28:17.076 --> 00:28:17.596]  Okie doke.
[00:28:18.257 --> 00:28:30.923]  I thought I heard over the weekend on one of the news broadcasts that Governor Bush, with his office, was taking any suggestions from anybody that had any ideas on what they could do.
[00:28:31.403 --> 00:28:32.623]  Well, that's true.
[00:28:33.764 --> 00:28:36.185]  Look, this is what happened over the weekend.
[00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:44.519]  Last week the Congress subpoenaed Terry and this little nothing judge said no.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:45.942]  Which is ridiculous.
[00:28:47.697 --> 00:28:54.941]  Now, then the governor was going to send in the state police via abuse charges for an investigation, but didn't.
[00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:58.823]  The governor could do this if he wanted to, he isn't.
[00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.925]  He's just basically using it as a political set piece.
[00:29:02.405 --> 00:29:07.888]  Yeah, I thought it might be interesting if he stuck somebody from his office on there just to see what they had to say.
[00:29:08.445 --> 00:29:09.666]  Well, they're pretty swamped.
[00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:13.107]  I'm told it's hard to even get through to the Governor's office, period.
[00:29:13.528 --> 00:29:15.168]  Much less get a spokesperson on.
[00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:22.312]  And one other question I had, a few years ago, this thing about Bill Clinton and the head of the U.N.
[00:29:22.492 --> 00:29:22.992]  had come up.
[00:29:23.412 --> 00:29:32.137]  And somewhere I heard that if the country sits on the Security Council, you can't have anybody from that country being the head of the U.N.
[00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:37.762]  You know, I believe that's the case, but I'd have to check that out.
[00:29:38.002 --> 00:29:40.765]  Yeah, if I'd mentioned it, I'd heard that, and maybe you could check it out.
[00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:49.092]  I'm glad you raised that, because Bill Clinton says he wants to be Secretary General, and a lot of major publications say he's probably going to be the next person.
[00:29:49.152 --> 00:29:49.772]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.814 --> 00:29:52.755]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.195 --> 00:29:54.817]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.737 --> 00:29:58.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:04.514]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy.
[00:30:04.614 --> 00:30:07.155]  But never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:14.918]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:30:15.018 --> 00:30:21.640]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.201]  Now it's available to you.
[00:30:23.361 --> 00:30:29.963]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:34.469]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:30:34.749 --> 00:30:41.017]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[00:30:41.157 --> 00:30:45.162]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.
[00:30:45.522 --> 00:30:45.823]  I think so.
[00:31:01.306 --> 00:31:04.328]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:09.552]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.813 --> 00:31:14.176]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.476 --> 00:31:19.360]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.383]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.583 --> 00:31:27.226]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:32.512]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:39.521]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:40.703]  What about you?
[00:31:41.344 --> 00:31:46.686]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:01.008 --> 00:32:05.474]  If you're a small business owner, you know small business loans can be hard to come by.
[00:32:05.735 --> 00:32:12.103]  So who can you turn to to get up to $150,000 in working capital in as little as seven days?
[00:32:12.403 --> 00:32:14.306]  You call AmeriMerchant.
[00:32:14.606 --> 00:32:15.768]  AmeriMerchant provides
[00:32:15.828 --> 00:32:16.128]  I think so.

[00:33:13.332 --> 00:33:16.634]  Continuing with wide open telephones on this Tuesday edition.
[00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:24.059]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, freshly updated multiple times daily.
[00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:28.922]  Let's go straight back to the calls and talk to James in North Carolina.
[00:33:28.942 --> 00:33:29.622]  James, hello.
[00:33:29.962 --> 00:33:31.183]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:33:32.084 --> 00:33:33.164]  I'm doing alright, James.
[00:33:33.284 --> 00:33:38.287]  Yeah, but it makes it hard to do alright when hearing all this news.
[00:33:39.048 --> 00:33:41.029]  Um, my father,
[00:33:42.343 --> 00:34:04.630]  They didn't know if he had Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's but he had to go to a rest home and they put him on feeding tubes and then with water and food and then he naturally died of a heart attack and I say why take these people off these things this this is terrible
[00:34:05.342 --> 00:34:07.223]  You know what this is leading up to?
[00:34:07.363 --> 00:34:13.286]  Well, in a lot of cases, people are in bad shape, but then they get better about half the time.
[00:34:15.146 --> 00:34:22.150]  Even when they're elderly, if they have to go on a feeding tube, they build their strength back up, and in many cases, you know, live another decade.
[00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.451]  Yeah, I mean, my father used to sit there and eat.
[00:34:25.491 --> 00:34:31.994]  Now, he wasn't like her, but he could sit in there and say, son, what did you have to eat today?
[00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:33.995]  Because he was swallowing
[00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:40.723]  A sock just couldn't work anymore so we fed him on the poop and water.
[00:34:51.303 --> 00:34:55.905]  And they were both associated with having surgery, because that's how it always happens, blood clots.
[00:34:56.506 --> 00:34:59.427]  And they both had their throats paralyzed where they couldn't eat.
[00:34:59.867 --> 00:35:10.433]  And my grandmother went on trips all over the country, cooked food, I guess for about six, seven, eight years, longer than that, before she finally died.
[00:35:10.493 --> 00:35:15.776]  But according to these bioethicists, they'd just go ahead and kill her, because her life isn't valuable.
[00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:16.436]  Thanks for the call.
[00:35:18.211 --> 00:35:20.131]  But, uh, she toughed it out for a long time.
[00:35:20.212 --> 00:35:32.675]  My, my grandfather, uh, he, uh, I guess he lived about five years after that happened, and he, he went from weighing about 250 pounds down to probably about 170.
[00:35:32.775 --> 00:35:34.795]  He never got really, really skinny.
[00:35:36.055 --> 00:35:41.057]  But, uh, it, it wasn't fun, but, you know, he was, he had a pretty good quality of life.
[00:35:41.377 --> 00:35:45.978]  The point is, you don't want to get the government involved in, oh, you have quality, you don't have quality.
[00:35:45.998 --> 00:35:46.538]  You understand?
[00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.712]  They're using the Terry Shiloh Schindler case.
[00:35:50.792 --> 00:35:56.456]  We say Schindler, folks, because her husband has left her for ten years, has another wife, has children.
[00:35:57.037 --> 00:36:03.001]  Under any gauge of civil law, he has divorced her.
[00:36:03.221 --> 00:36:03.922]  He has left her.
[00:36:04.422 --> 00:36:05.203]  He has abandoned her.
[00:36:06.403 --> 00:36:08.445]  And, of course, I don't know if you know the story.
[00:36:08.485 --> 00:36:12.448]  Some people still that I talk to on the street, or who email me, don't know the story.
[00:36:12.488 --> 00:36:15.850]  He said he wanted to rehabilitate her until he got the settlement.
[00:36:17.282 --> 00:36:20.224]  $300,000 for himself and $700,000 for her.
[00:36:20.684 --> 00:36:25.126]  As soon as he got the settlement, he totally changed and said, no more treatment, no more nothing.
[00:36:25.146 --> 00:36:28.008]  When is that bitch going to die?
[00:36:28.068 --> 00:36:29.209]  That's from the affidavit.
[00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:37.273]  And she was responding very nicely to the treatment.
[00:36:38.053 --> 00:36:40.515]  To the rehabilitation.
[00:36:41.775 --> 00:36:43.997]  So, they're now redefining terms.
[00:36:44.197 --> 00:36:46.578]  And it's very, very scary.
[00:36:47.755 --> 00:36:51.238]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Dave in Wisconsin.
[00:36:51.258 --> 00:36:51.938]  Dave, welcome.
[00:36:52.578 --> 00:36:55.080]  Good day, anyway, Alex.
[00:36:56.141 --> 00:36:57.422]  I just wanted to bring up a couple things.
[00:36:57.522 --> 00:37:04.046]  I was down there at Pinellas Park for the last week, and I don't know if you knew that they had snipers on the roof.
[00:37:04.688 --> 00:37:13.353]  Around the buildings, they had two on the hospice that I personally saw, and then they had one on a utility shut, probably about a quarter of a mile away.
[00:37:13.633 --> 00:37:19.877]  Well, listen, I mean, we've gone out and had land rights rallies, Second Amendment rallies, and they've had SWAT teams.
[00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:26.220]  I mean, I've been walking and seen the rifle aimed at my head, and I start waving at them, and you know, the guys laugh at me.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.943]  And I'm just walking around, you know, wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans, no weapons, with a bullhorn.
[00:37:31.941 --> 00:37:59.075]  uh... but uh... finally people did quote rush instead of one at a time being arrested with glasses of water yesterday and uh... NPR did call it they said the violence escalated with the protesters implying that there had already been violence and then they went on to say when they rushed the police with glasses of water
[00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:04.599]  Well, that's not violent, but there they are again, semantically manipulating words.
[00:38:05.938 --> 00:38:18.943]  Also, we were out there with a picture of Auschwitz and we also brought up on the sign that it was before where they started with that secret program the Nazis did of starving children to death, disabled children.
[00:38:19.663 --> 00:38:25.365]  And the press, we went out with a Nazi flag and the press pretty much ignored us for the most part.
[00:38:26.186 --> 00:38:29.527]  They don't want to go that way, they don't want to compare it to Nazi Germany.
[00:38:31.195 --> 00:38:46.015]  Well, I've talked to other people that are there, and you'll have hundreds of people with anti-death signs, but the media, and I've seen it on the news and in AP and other snapshots, they will show the one or two signs that are for killing Terry.
[00:38:47.259 --> 00:38:54.303]  Yeah, and I heard one person say that there was about an equal amount of protesters on both sides, which was totally untrue.
[00:38:54.323 --> 00:39:03.568]  The most I saw were six for killing Terry, and there was probably 200 to 300 on the other side at the time that she was saying this.
[00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:08.411]  Well, when you notice, the news doesn't like to show wide shots of the crowd.
[00:39:08.451 --> 00:39:09.611]  That's a trick they play.
[00:39:10.412 --> 00:39:14.334]  Since you raised Hitler, since you brought up Adolf Hitler,
[00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:26.152]  Shortly after being elected, the Nazi doctrine was kill the old, the infirm, the psychologically unclean.
[00:39:26.892 --> 00:39:29.694]  They called it racial sanitation.
[00:39:31.444 --> 00:39:52.334]  And the first person that they publicly killed, now the Nazis for two years after getting into office were killing most of the people in the hospitals, taking their food and water away, giving injections to people that were paralyzed even from the chest down if they weren't politically connected.
[00:39:53.315 --> 00:39:55.596]  This is part of the mainstream history books.
[00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.818]  Yeah, that was part of T4.
[00:39:57.938 --> 00:40:00.980]  It was secret to keep it from the German people for a long time.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.440]  Exactly, until 1935.
[00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:05.062]  And just like with the Schiavo case...
[00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:11.560]  They picked a poster child, because they know that human beings interface on an individual basis.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.681]  So, through the image of one person, it's easier for us to get a concept.
[00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:17.642]  Stalin said it.
[00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:20.342]  One person dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:40:20.362 --> 00:40:22.763]  10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:32.365]  So, this family, who were high-level Nazis, wrote a letter to the Fuhrer that was published in newspapers and put in newsreels, and Hitler talked about it in the national speech.
[00:40:33.005 --> 00:40:41.493]  In 1935, when he then introduced this to the German people and went public, kind of the maiden voyage where they publicly launched it.
[00:40:42.654 --> 00:40:53.483]  And Hitler read the letter on the air, and I read a copy of the letter, and it was, our son is totally unhappy, he is an idiot, that was the term for being retarded, he was really autistic.
[00:40:54.668 --> 00:41:01.516]  And all he does is walk around, you know, in the woods and murmur and say the same thing over and over again.
[00:41:01.677 --> 00:41:14.752]  Oh please, Fuhrer, give us permission to kill him and rid the Reich of this, you know, of this... They use the same term that eugenics individuals use in this country.
[00:41:15.632 --> 00:41:18.515]  So, Hitler said, all right, you can kill him.
[00:41:19.115 --> 00:41:21.617]  And it was a loving, good thing that Fuhrer did.
[00:41:21.637 --> 00:41:23.499]  And it was all over Nazi news.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.804]  And in America, Hitler was hailed by the eugenics crowd that runs Planned Parenthood today.
[00:41:29.864 --> 00:41:32.927]  Margaret Sanger got awards from Hitler, gave awards to Hitler.
[00:41:33.748 --> 00:41:34.428]  All of this.
[00:41:34.769 --> 00:41:36.490]  And so you're absolutely right.
[00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:39.953]  And then a few years later, they were basically killing everybody.
[00:41:39.973 --> 00:41:40.033]  Yep.
[00:41:41.114 --> 00:41:42.095]  And that's where we're headed.
[00:41:42.907 --> 00:41:45.068]  If people don't get out there and try to stop them.
[00:41:45.408 --> 00:41:50.411]  But notice they use these special cases to introduce it to the public.
[00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:56.154]  Any other observations you made, Dave, while you were in Pinellas Park, Florida?
[00:41:56.414 --> 00:42:10.241]  Yeah, I would say that the crowd was very peaceful, and I actually, for when they were in their murdering in person, I thought they should have been a little more vocal and raucous, even though the family would have been a little
[00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:15.308]  Upset because they claimed we were disturbing the other patients at that hospice.
[00:42:15.748 --> 00:42:19.891]  But, you know, people, if they love their family members, should get them out of that hospice.
[00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:23.874]  Are you saying family members of other people in the hospice or the Schindlers?
[00:42:24.334 --> 00:42:26.936]  Family members of both, as a matter of fact.
[00:42:27.056 --> 00:42:29.477]  One lady, her aunt had died.
[00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:32.499]  She said that we were upsetting other patients in there.
[00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:35.341]  Well, you know, that's not your problem.
[00:42:35.401 --> 00:42:38.523]  That's the problem of the people engaging in murder.
[00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:40.565]  Absolutely.
[00:42:40.585 --> 00:42:42.086]  Listen, I want to say this right now.
[00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:45.568]  I'm tired of all the word manipulation.
[00:42:45.588 --> 00:42:50.351]  I mean, that's the nature of what Eric Blair, known as George Orwell, wrote about in 1984.
[00:42:51.332 --> 00:42:54.194]  They call it, in the news, she's being given treatment.
[00:42:54.594 --> 00:42:58.116]  She's being given care in the hospice right now.
[00:42:59.037 --> 00:43:02.819]  They get on the news and say we can't give her water because it might hurt her.
[00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:06.942]  Folks, I've actually heard them say this on national news.
[00:43:07.634 --> 00:43:10.377]  They're changing all of these semantics around.
[00:43:10.937 --> 00:43:11.718]  It's a fraud!
[00:43:12.459 --> 00:43:14.220]  They're turning us into a deaf culture.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.301]  Totally.
[00:43:15.662 --> 00:43:16.382]  They certainly are.
[00:43:16.442 --> 00:43:17.483]  Anything else, Steve?
[00:43:17.684 --> 00:43:18.464]  No, that would be all.
[00:43:18.524 --> 00:43:19.145]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:19.545 --> 00:43:20.486]  I have one last question.
[00:43:20.526 --> 00:43:24.470]  What prompted you to get in your car and drive down there from Wisconsin?
[00:43:25.171 --> 00:43:29.595]  Well, I looked at it myself and another pastor, as a matter of fact.
[00:43:29.875 --> 00:43:32.738]  We looked at it as kind of a watershed case.
[00:43:33.564 --> 00:43:37.887]  In that they want to, you know, basically get into the general public euthanasia.
[00:43:38.027 --> 00:43:38.487]  No, you're right.
[00:43:39.328 --> 00:43:41.629]  It's like Roe v. Wade.
[00:43:42.129 --> 00:43:53.216]  It's being introduced to us, and now the next time we hear about it, we won't be as upset, and it'll also give us this feeling of defeatism, this feeling of it can't be stopped.
[00:43:54.255 --> 00:43:56.396]  That's right, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:59.637]  They're going to shove it down our throats whether we like it or not.
[00:43:59.957 --> 00:44:06.759]  And if you watch the National News and the spin they're putting on it, like you say, they're euphoric when they're going without food and water.
[00:44:06.779 --> 00:44:10.160]  I mean, these idiots, I wish they'd go without food and water for a couple of days.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:16.362]  Well, I fasted one time, just because it is healthy to do occasionally, for four days.
[00:44:18.503 --> 00:44:24.408]  Man, I did not enjoy it, but they say that not eating is nothing compared to not drinking.
[00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:25.069]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.093]  I really do appreciate that, and I appreciate you going down there.
[00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:29.913]  You did the right thing.
[00:44:31.095 --> 00:44:32.015]  God bless you, Dave.
[00:44:33.397 --> 00:44:36.239]  Now, they know exactly what they're doing with this case.
[00:44:37.401 --> 00:44:38.462]  John in Tennessee.
[00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:39.342]  John, go ahead.
[00:44:39.783 --> 00:44:39.943]  Hello.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:47.804]  I have a question about Colonel Bogright filing affidavits of citizen's arrest against Michael Schiavo and Judge Greer.
[00:44:48.624 --> 00:44:50.385]  But of course it did not succeed.
[00:44:51.045 --> 00:44:55.988]  And Gritz was arrested for trying to bring water to Terry, which serves no useful purpose.
[00:44:56.908 --> 00:45:03.292]  Now to make a citizen's arrest, a person must make physical contact with the arrestee and take them into custody.
[00:45:04.152 --> 00:45:07.554]  But to file a legitimate criminal complaint and get the police to make an arrest,
[00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:16.347]  It can only be filed with a judge in criminal court who holds an instant hearing on probable cause to determine if he should issue an arrest warrant.
[00:45:16.987 --> 00:45:21.129]  But Gritz filed his affidavit with the prosecutor and Governor Bush, so it had no effect.
[00:45:22.129 --> 00:45:30.191]  And my question is, as a military officer, Gritz is still in the Army Reserves, so is he an infiltrator that could subvert the arrest?
[00:45:31.432 --> 00:45:32.252]  Well, his name is
[00:45:33.405 --> 00:45:34.925]  He is bogue rights!
[00:45:36.466 --> 00:45:38.066]  Just so you know, it's not grits.
[00:45:38.106 --> 00:45:39.506]  That's my take on it.
[00:45:40.646 --> 00:45:41.487]  Okay, I understand.
[00:45:41.547 --> 00:45:42.847]  It's tongue-in-cheek.
[00:45:43.147 --> 00:45:47.688]  Was he sent to protect the massive insurance-reserved frauds in these medical death camps?
[00:45:48.488 --> 00:45:55.549]  And to protect Bush and protect the genocide of 7,000 Americans every day in bed-now practice and aborticide?
[00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:57.249]  Or is he legitimate?
[00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.310]  John, you know what?
[00:46:00.919 --> 00:46:03.960]  I don't think Bo was down there for a bad reason.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:11.082]  I think he was down there because he's legitimately concerned and I appreciate your call.
[00:46:11.482 --> 00:46:13.282]  Listen, I have nothing against Bo Grites.
[00:46:13.682 --> 00:46:22.624]  I got in a big fight with him on air one time when he was a guest because he's arrogant and he won't admit that he was wrong about what he said about Patriots on CNN.
[00:46:24.425 --> 00:46:28.386]  But for those that don't know, remember the
[00:46:30.859 --> 00:46:38.104]  Teenager, or he was like a college student, 19 years old, who was bombing all over the Midwest.
[00:46:38.624 --> 00:46:42.727]  Little mailbox bombs that, thank God, didn't hurt anybody.
[00:46:43.428 --> 00:46:48.111]  And I looked at the bombs on TV, the map, and I said, that's almost a smiley face.
[00:46:49.432 --> 00:46:54.135]  And then listeners emailed and said, have you seen Fight Club with Tyler Durgan?
[00:46:54.986 --> 00:46:57.687]  Where they bomb the shape of smiley faces in buildings.
[00:46:57.727 --> 00:47:02.848]  And I said, yep, this is some young drug head who thinks he's part of Fight Club.
[00:47:04.848 --> 00:47:06.789]  And that is exactly what it was.
[00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:08.169]  And we're on record predicting that.
[00:47:08.509 --> 00:47:11.610]  Now we're on air saying what it is with basic criminology.
[00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.631]  Thanks to you, the listeners, for putting our heads together.
[00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.111]  That's what police do.
[00:47:15.131 --> 00:47:19.832]  They get a bunch of detectives in a room and brainstorm for, you know, ten hours around coffee.
[00:47:20.172 --> 00:47:21.053]  Well, that's what we did.
[00:47:21.573 --> 00:47:22.613]  We had the answer.
[00:47:23.211 --> 00:47:26.615]  When the government was sucking their thumbs and had no idea what was going on.
[00:47:27.096 --> 00:47:28.517]  Well, Bo gets up on CNN.
[00:47:28.597 --> 00:47:33.303]  This was like two or three years ago, so I forget all the details.
[00:47:33.403 --> 00:47:39.771]  He gets up basically out of the video clip somewhere and says, well this is this right-wing, militia-type, black helicopter crowd.
[00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:40.932]  That's probably who's behind it.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.861]  Now, that's pretty suspect, and I don't know why he said that.
[00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:48.763]  And then I got him up on the air and said he was wrong, and he said, no, I'm not wrong.
[00:47:49.163 --> 00:47:54.966]  So that's why I don't interview Bo, I don't, uh, you know, I don't, I don't, uh, I mean, it was bad.
[00:47:54.986 --> 00:48:00.008]  I mean, I've said stuff that's wrong before, nothing of that magnitude, but I'll say I'm wrong.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:08.372]  But I don't want to sit here and say, Bo's some government agent, and he's bad, and... And this brings me into a whole other subject, and we'll go to Jim and others.
[00:48:10.231 --> 00:48:15.675]  I've heard people on the radio saying it's all a giant theatrical production.
[00:48:17.136 --> 00:48:20.419]  That this is all a staged event and the Schindlers are in on it.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.281]  Folks, that is clearly not true.
[00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:26.783]  I've interviewed the Schindlers three, four years ago.
[00:48:28.544 --> 00:48:31.967]  You're right in the fact that you're saying that it's a theater.
[00:48:32.087 --> 00:48:35.229]  That the media has decided to focus in on this.
[00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:37.471]  But the Schindlers are good people.
[00:48:38.943 --> 00:48:43.106]  And I'm really, you know, my heart goes out to them, but this happens.
[00:48:45.608 --> 00:48:56.376]  Folks that are into the New World Order, into the Truth Movement, they get away from what they can prove, and they get off so many times, quite frankly, into the absurd.
[00:48:58.638 --> 00:49:04.202]  And that's why some people don't listen to us, because they've heard so many kooks out there,
[00:49:06.042 --> 00:49:17.586]  Who just extrapolate and basically with the most tenuous fragments of tertiary capillary evidence start extrapolating and making stuff up.
[00:49:19.947 --> 00:49:23.388]  When we've got just so many real things we can prove and focus in on.
[00:49:25.269 --> 00:49:30.631]  And really, for the people out there that are attacking the Schindlers now, I mean, give me a break.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.802]  You really need to spend your time on better issues.
[00:49:36.522 --> 00:49:41.385]  There are so many real things that are unbelievable that are happening.
[00:49:42.585 --> 00:49:46.307]  Like that Cynthia McKinney clip we played from the House Armed Services Committee last week.
[00:49:46.848 --> 00:49:49.489]  In a Rumsfeld, government-run white slavery rings.
[00:49:49.889 --> 00:49:52.050]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.171]  9-11 war games.
[00:49:53.231 --> 00:49:54.691]  I mean, this is real stuff.
[00:49:55.132 --> 00:49:57.013]  Cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:49:57.233 --> 00:49:57.573]  Real.
[00:50:00.265 --> 00:50:02.306]  Genetic engineering of most of the crops.
[00:50:02.406 --> 00:50:08.247]  The patenting of the food chain.
[00:50:08.307 --> 00:50:12.009]  Just hundreds of real things that are happening.
[00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:14.309]  The free trade area of the Americas.
[00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:16.910]  National toll roads going in everywhere.
[00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:22.732]  But so many people, when I tune into other radio shows, when I go to other, quote, patriot websites,
[00:50:23.812 --> 00:50:25.333]  They don't talk about that stuff.
[00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:32.237]  It's just all, this Patriot's bad, this Patriot's good, I like this person, I don't like that person.
[00:50:32.257 --> 00:50:38.720]  You know, why does Alex Jones do these radio interviews with mainstream talk show hosts?
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.461]  He's evil.
[00:50:40.421 --> 00:50:43.283]  No, I'm going into their territory.
[00:50:44.163 --> 00:50:47.225]  I'm engaging in information warfare.
[00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:50.947]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:50:52.162 --> 00:50:56.366]  So come on, let's get our heads screwed on straight, and let's stick with the facts.
[00:50:56.786 --> 00:50:57.427]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:05.934]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.114 --> 00:51:10.558]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.678 --> 00:51:15.081]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.101 --> 00:51:16.483]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.243 --> 00:51:18.184]  Panama.
[00:51:18.224 --> 00:51:22.467]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.507 --> 00:51:29.453]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.573 --> 00:51:31.635]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.815 --> 00:51:42.323]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.583 --> 00:51:43.404]  If you want to understand
[00:51:43.404 --> 00:51:43.984]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:05.045 --> 00:52:13.874]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.194 --> 00:52:18.859]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.339 --> 00:52:26.062]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.462 --> 00:52:38.267]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.707 --> 00:52:43.168]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.348 --> 00:52:45.789]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:22.957 --> 00:54:30.519]  Before I go back to Jim and Doug and Don and Rose, Mary and many others that are patiently holding
[00:54:31.952 --> 00:54:36.875]  My new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[00:54:37.836 --> 00:54:41.718]  Learn the secret that holds the world in its grasp.
[00:54:41.858 --> 00:54:46.381]  Find out who the Globalist are, what their driving ideology and philosophy is.
[00:54:46.882 --> 00:54:51.905]  They are members of a secret worldwide society known as the Order of Death.
[00:54:53.546 --> 00:54:56.788]  You know about Skull and Bones, that's only one chapter.
[00:54:58.668 --> 00:55:04.290]  One node, though it is a command ship, in this flotilla of evil.
[00:55:05.731 --> 00:55:13.094]  And we spend 35 minutes on the police state, the sound cannons, the secret arrests, the secret police taking photos, the surveillance blimps.
[00:55:13.534 --> 00:55:17.536]  An hour on 9-11, the latest, most powerful information.
[00:55:17.576 --> 00:55:20.237]  We lay out how the globalists carried out the attacks.
[00:55:21.037 --> 00:55:27.320]  Then we spend an hour on the Bush-Nazi connection, the death cult connection, the skull and bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:29.331]  Schwarzenegger.
[00:55:29.932 --> 00:55:30.433]  All of it.
[00:55:30.513 --> 00:55:32.135]  You need to have Martial Law.
[00:55:33.176 --> 00:55:32.135]  $25.95.
[00:55:33.676 --> 00:55:35.318]  Two hours, 35 minutes long.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.584]  It's really three films in one.
[00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:41.826]  And you need to have it.
[00:55:41.987 --> 00:55:47.934]  So go to nfowars.com to order Martial Law via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart.

[00:55:57.331 --> 00:55:57.371]  888-253-3139.
[00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:58.851]  The wait is over.
[00:55:58.871 --> 00:56:00.032]  Marshall Law is shipping.
[00:56:12.552 --> 00:56:12.932]  Yes, Alex.
[00:56:40.174 --> 00:56:45.239]  On this, from a humanistic point of view, I agree with everything you say about this Schindler case.
[00:56:46.379 --> 00:56:50.103]  But, when you knock the judge on his decision, you're dead wrong.
[00:56:51.023 --> 00:56:56.048]  Because, some time ago, we were converted from people to a resource.
[00:56:57.085 --> 00:57:11.830]  Well, just because under admiralty law they've all declared a slave chattel of the state under a mercantile enterprise, doesn't mean that this parallel legal system they've built is the legitimate legal system.
[00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.630]  Well, that's what we ought to work on.
[00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.611]  Get rid of that.
[00:57:15.391 --> 00:57:21.433]  But until we do, and nobody griped, I didn't hear one talk show anywhere talk about being converted to a resource.
[00:57:22.515 --> 00:57:23.116]  Well, it's true.
[00:57:23.176 --> 00:57:27.962]  They call us, you know, your manager is called the Resource Manager, Human Resources.
[00:57:28.262 --> 00:57:28.743]  Absolutely.
[00:57:28.803 --> 00:57:32.207]  And under this whole bioethics system, they decide if you're a good resource.
[00:57:32.728 --> 00:57:35.811]  Now, as a resource, they can do anything to you they want to.
[00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:38.855]  A farmer that has a cow that's not productive, what do you do with it?
[00:57:40.413 --> 00:57:44.176]  Well, again, courts have said black people aren't human beings.
[00:57:44.216 --> 00:57:45.316]  We just don't follow that.
[00:57:45.616 --> 00:57:46.337]  That's a fraud.
[00:57:46.597 --> 00:57:50.159]  The courts can say none of us have rights and they decide if we're human.
[00:57:50.179 --> 00:57:51.480]  That's what the bioethics boards do.
[00:57:51.881 --> 00:57:52.701]  It's a fraud.
[00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:57.564]  We've all got to have our living wills clearly stating our rights.
[00:57:57.624 --> 00:57:58.265]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:58.765 --> 00:58:04.649]  But Governor Bush here in Texas, before he left office, made it to where the state, if they're paying for you, will kill you.
[00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:09.032]  And the so-called Christians don't want to talk about that.
[00:58:09.793 --> 00:58:11.334]  Uh, let's talk to, who's up next here?
[00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.497]  Doug in Canada, go ahead.
[00:58:14.517 --> 00:58:15.478]  Hi, Alex.
[00:58:15.858 --> 00:58:16.018]  Hello.
[00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:21.503]  Um, you know, it takes a big man to back his words up, but it takes a bigger man to admit he was wrong and carry on.
[00:58:22.303 --> 00:58:32.432]  Um, yeah, McKinnon, I, or McKinney, I think if more people like, um, if we had more people like her with a backbone and places of power, then we wouldn't be in the position we're in today.
[00:58:32.612 --> 00:58:33.873]  Have you seen that video clip?
[00:58:34.093 --> 00:58:34.333]  Yes.
[00:58:35.074 --> 00:58:36.976]  And I've heard it many, many times on the network here.
[00:58:37.656 --> 00:58:38.477]  That's just powerful.
[00:58:39.898 --> 00:58:40.559]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:58:40.619 --> 00:58:40.999]  Stay there.
[00:58:41.039 --> 00:58:46.324]  We'll talk about it when we get into the second hour here in 70 seconds.
[00:58:47.084 --> 00:58:49.306]  Then in about 10 minutes, we got a big guest coming on.
[00:58:57.694 --> 00:58:58.374]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.995 --> 00:59:00.016]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.758 --> 00:59:01.959]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.499 --> 00:59:03.359]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.099 --> 00:59:05.620]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.322 --> 00:59:14.443]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.224 --> 00:59:21.506]  The essence of mind control is changing our values.
[00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:27.008]  Changing and altering our world view to accept
[00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:31.500]  Having our private property taken without just compensation.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.661]  Having our Bill of Rights and Constitution dismantled.
[00:59:35.701 --> 00:59:38.502]  Having torture promoted as a value.
[00:59:40.783 --> 00:59:44.724]  Conditioning the public to accept giving up our sovereignty for world government.
[00:59:45.604 --> 00:59:57.328]  We're going to be talking about that with the author of Torture and Truth, America Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror, Mark Danner, who's also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:59:58.399 --> 01:00:04.344]  We'll also get more into Terry Shiloh Schindler, the earthquake yesterday, and the hundreds of dead.
[01:00:04.364 --> 01:00:06.306]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:06.366 --> 01:00:09.308]  Right now, going back to Doug in Canada.
[01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:14.273]  Doug, you were bringing up that Cynthia McKinney clip we played first last week.
[01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:15.173]  Now, others have aired it.
[01:00:16.895 --> 01:00:20.238]  It's posted on InfoWars.com, still on the main page today.
[01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:34.289]  And if you go to Infowars.com you can watch it right there where she brought up all these incredible issues to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and he was at a loss for words and looked quite shaken, did he not?
[01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:37.131]  It was actually very satisfying to see that.
[01:00:37.151 --> 01:00:40.193]  Just to watch them square them in their seats.
[01:00:41.067 --> 01:00:41.407]  It was.
[01:00:41.548 --> 01:00:42.729]  Satisfying is a good word.
[01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:51.918]  One thing, or the major thing I called in about, your call earlier talked about the guy in British Columbia seeing all the military transport trucks.
[01:00:52.999 --> 01:00:53.980]  That is going on here.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:01:02.189]  They have admitted they're doing war games with the American military and the Mexican military as per last week's discussion with President Bush.
[01:01:03.052 --> 01:01:13.221]  Oh yeah, in fact it's been on the CBC, Canadians are upset about quote, giving up their sovereignty for the Union of American States through the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:01:13.722 --> 01:01:19.807]  And so the Mexicans in Canadian newspapers are talking about it, but the average American has no idea this is even going on.
[01:01:20.287 --> 01:01:21.969]  Exactly, and it's really, really scary.
[01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:25.352]  Like in my city they're doing weather and chemical warfare here.
[01:01:25.752 --> 01:01:30.036]  You can see it in the skies, and I have the proof, but you can't tell anybody that because they don't believe you.
[01:01:31.129 --> 01:01:42.536]  Well, it's been in the Globe and Mail, it's been on the CBC that you've got this Northcom drills with Mexican and Canadian and U.S.
[01:01:42.576 --> 01:01:43.257]  troops up there.
[01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:53.863]  It was even in one of your big papers a few months ago about state police from Texas up in British Columbia running checkpoints.
[01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:58.006]  It's really scary, and just one quick quote here that comes from our military.
[01:01:58.664 --> 01:02:02.585]  One minute you can be having coffee with someone, and the next you're gonna need to pull a gun.
[01:02:04.905 --> 01:02:06.066]  That pretty much sums it up there.
[01:02:06.346 --> 01:02:07.766]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:08.706 --> 01:02:14.887]  And again, terrorism is being used as the pretext to radically shift our entire society into a total police state.
[01:02:15.187 --> 01:02:24.909]  They tell you as a citizen you've got to give up all your liberties and allow your life to be under a microscope, but the borders, northern and southern, are more open than they've ever been.
[01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:27.550]  It's a fraud.
[01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:28.230]  It's a joke.
[01:02:29.961 --> 01:02:39.065]  And they engage in what they call acing, where people flying in from Middle Eastern countries don't even have to show their IDs coming off these international flights.
[01:02:39.726 --> 01:02:47.750]  You try to fly to see your grandma in Indiana, you're lucky if you don't get strip-searched by some foreigner who can't even speak English.
[01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:48.370]  I'm not kidding!
[01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:57.304]  They had a report a few years ago at the Boston Logan Airport, 90% of the people working at the airport were not citizens.
[01:02:58.265 --> 01:03:00.186]  Something like 20% were illegal aliens.
[01:03:01.327 --> 01:03:03.348]  I mean, how do you get numbers like that?
[01:03:03.368 --> 01:03:04.389]  And I've been at these airports.
[01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:14.756]  Most of the time it's some foreigner, you know, who was just a few years ago shoving machine guns in people's backs, you know, in Bangladesh, and now they're doing it to you.
[01:03:16.657 --> 01:03:17.237]  It's amazing.
[01:03:17.658 --> 01:03:19.459]  Alright, we've got a great guest coming up.
[01:03:20.626 --> 01:03:25.630]  Torture and Truth, America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror by Mark Danner.
[01:03:26.811 --> 01:03:30.454]  And he writes for a bunch of different major publications like New Yorker Magazine, you name it.
[01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.256]  He'll be joining us after this quick break.
[01:03:34.557 --> 01:03:41.162]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and the websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:41.682 --> 01:03:43.043]  Please stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:03:53.106 --> 01:03:59.928]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.249 --> 01:04:01.629]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:04.030]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.271]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:11.473]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.813 --> 01:04:15.835]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.095 --> 01:04:17.876]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:17.956 --> 01:04:28.600]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.641]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:34.722]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Info War.
[01:04:34.802 --> 01:04:36.083]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.951]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.729 --> 01:04:58.230]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:02.672]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:02.972 --> 01:05:03.512]  We listened.
[01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:08.813]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:09.554]  We listened.
[01:05:09.934 --> 01:05:12.975]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.415 --> 01:05:13.955]  We listened.
[01:05:14.395 --> 01:05:17.556]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:05:17.796 --> 01:05:18.376]  We're good to go.
[01:05:41.288 --> 01:05:41.368]  888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:42.269]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:53.832]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:05:54.032 --> 01:05:56.053]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:05:56.233 --> 01:05:56.934]  Prepare yourself.
[01:05:57.094 --> 01:06:00.796]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:12.622]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[01:06:22.131 --> 01:06:22.431]  U.S.
[01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:23.512]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:24.732]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[01:06:24.872 --> 01:06:25.632]  Which are collectible?
[01:06:25.692 --> 01:06:26.433]  Which are bullion?
[01:06:26.493 --> 01:06:28.614]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[01:06:28.954 --> 01:06:31.095]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[01:06:31.135 --> 01:06:31.515]  Coins.

[01:06:53.839 --> 01:06:59.481]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:05.483]  Torture and Truth!
[01:07:06.144 --> 01:07:10.105]  America Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror by Mark Danner.
[01:07:11.786 --> 01:07:17.428]  And Mark, like many of our guests, has a gigantic bio, you can just
[01:07:18.072 --> 01:07:23.636]  Link through at Infowars.com to his website markdanner.com.
[01:07:23.676 --> 01:07:25.818]  Danner is D-A-N-N-E-R.
[01:07:26.618 --> 01:07:33.603]  And Mark Danner is a writer, journalist, and professor who has written for more than two decades on foreign affairs and international conflict.
[01:07:34.043 --> 01:07:44.731]  He has covered Central America, Haiti, the Balkans, and Iraq, among other stories, and has written extensively about the development of American foreign policy during the late Cold War and afterward.
[01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:52.234]  And about violations of human rights during that time, his book, Torture and Truth, is what we're about to be talking about.
[01:07:52.714 --> 01:08:14.124]  And he is also a member of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, with its 25, roughly 100 members, most of the most prestigious members of academia, of banking and finance, government, entertainment, philosophy, you name it.
[01:08:15.274 --> 01:08:25.856]  And I do take Foreign Affairs, the bi-monthly publication, that I consider to basically be the CFR's propaganda, but they do have a diverse group of members.
[01:08:26.076 --> 01:08:37.878]  I've had probably 20 CFR members on, actually more than that, over the years, but it's great to have Mr. Danner on with us today.
[01:08:38.798 --> 01:08:40.418]  Mr. Danner, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:08:40.878 --> 01:08:41.599]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:42.599]  Thank you for inviting me.
[01:08:43.079 --> 01:08:43.479]  You bet.
[01:08:44.992 --> 01:08:50.975]  How did you get into writing this book, Torture and Truth, America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror?
[01:08:51.675 --> 01:08:54.156]  Because I've read the synopsis of it online.
[01:08:54.596 --> 01:08:59.018]  You basically, correct me if I'm wrong, point the finger and say, look, this stuff was ordered.
[01:08:59.058 --> 01:09:00.839]  Well, we have the Army's own documents, that's admitted.
[01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:03.640]  But still, the general public isn't aware of that.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.022]  And then my other question is, are you popular at the CFR, having these views?
[01:09:09.082 --> 01:09:12.704]  Because it seems the CFR right now is dominated by the neocons.
[01:09:14.299 --> 01:09:23.664]  Well, the first question, how I got involved in writing about it, I had been writing about Iraq and the Iraq War, and this was part of that.
[01:09:23.864 --> 01:09:31.808]  In fact, the images that were broadcast about a year ago now were enormously important in the war itself.
[01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:35.250]  They gave a very strong boost to the insurgency.
[01:09:37.086 --> 01:09:43.329]  Extremely useful to them in propaganda and so on and in recruiting members of the insurgency.
[01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:54.593]  So though we look at this as a domestic kind of scandal, it had a lot to do with the Iraq War and giving help to the insurgency in fighting the Americans.
[01:09:54.633 --> 01:09:57.594]  So that's the original, originally how I began writing about it.
[01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:06.498]  It soon became evident though that a lot of the documents that were being either released by the government
[01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:34.865]  or leaked by the government that were extremely important it seemed to me for a public understanding of what exactly happened uh... this is one of those cases where if you actually look at the documents if you look at the reports you look at the the depositions of those who were abused and tortured uh... you look at what the government itself has found to have happened at Abu Ghraib and also at other prisons uh... it isn't terribly controversial what went on there
[01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:46.354]  What is controversy is the difference between what the government says happened and what was actually found out in these reports.
[01:10:46.434 --> 01:10:51.339]  So I felt very strongly that one had to try to bridge that gap.
[01:10:52.043 --> 01:11:01.786]  And so the book, Torture and Truth, includes not only my writing about what happened and the Iraq War itself, but the documents from the government that tell what happened.
[01:11:01.826 --> 01:11:02.946]  But let me stop you right there.
[01:11:03.006 --> 01:11:06.367]  By controversial, you mean, what happened there isn't being debated.
[01:11:07.267 --> 01:11:11.369]  Well, it's an interesting... Or do you mean it's not that big of a deal?
[01:11:11.389 --> 01:11:12.169]  Please clarify.
[01:11:12.449 --> 01:11:12.809]  No, no.
[01:11:12.889 --> 01:11:14.689]  I certainly think it is a very big deal.
[01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:19.851]  When I say controversial and not controversial, I mean that the actual thing... It's very transparent.
[01:11:21.085 --> 01:11:27.107]  It is transparent if you actually look at the investigations into what happened.
[01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:31.248]  But you'll never know what really happened if you watch the nightly news, because... That's right.
[01:11:31.828 --> 01:11:32.388]  That's right.
[01:11:32.508 --> 01:11:41.091]  Because the government responded to what happened by simply saying, you know, this was a few bad apples, which is the traditional
[01:11:41.953 --> 01:11:44.874]  A response of governments who are accused of torture.
[01:11:45.154 --> 01:11:57.557]  The United Kingdom said that in the early seventies when there was a famous case in Northern Ireland and it's happened a number of times and the few bad apples defense is actually the way lawyers describe it.
[01:11:57.998 --> 01:12:00.178]  I like the analogy of cockroaches.
[01:12:01.018 --> 01:12:04.639]  We've already seen ten big fat cockroaches on the kitchen floor.
[01:12:04.999 --> 01:12:06.720]  There's probably a thousand in the walls.
[01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:12.205]  Well, that's a homely metaphor that's very effective, I think.
[01:12:12.225 --> 01:12:14.146]  I mean, they claim, oh, it's just a few bad apples.
[01:12:14.186 --> 01:12:15.968]  No, this is just where they got caught.
[01:12:16.769 --> 01:12:18.990]  Yeah, I'm afraid that is the case.
[01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:21.853]  And, you know, increasingly this stuff has come out.
[01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:26.817]  We've essentially had revelations at the rate of a few a week.
[01:12:27.458 --> 01:12:34.544]  So the problem is, though, is the administration essentially counts on people not actually looking at the record.
[01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:36.605]  Psychological fatigue as well.
[01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.126]  You just get tired of hearing about it.
[01:12:38.466 --> 01:12:39.507]  I think that's very true.
[01:12:39.527 --> 01:12:40.607]  I think that's very true.
[01:12:40.667 --> 01:12:42.909]  It's a subject that people don't like to think about.
[01:12:43.369 --> 01:12:44.150]  It's shameful.
[01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:45.050]  It's unpleasant.
[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:55.236]  And I think the administration believes that, you know, most people in the country would just as soon believe what the president says rather than look at things that might contradict what he says.
[01:12:55.336 --> 01:12:59.797]  Well, I want to get into your book that's got a lot of reviews for being very scholarly on the subject.
[01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:09.180]  I myself even made a film about it, so I'm up to speed and have basically all the declassified documents and official Army reports on it, as well as a Red Cross report.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.642]  But I want to shift gears back to the CFR, which I would say is dominated by the neocons at this point.
[01:13:15.482 --> 01:13:17.823]  Are you popular there in the halls of the CFR?
[01:13:18.784 --> 01:13:20.885]  Well, so far as I know, I'm popular there.
[01:13:21.506 --> 01:13:27.171]  As you and I discussed before, it's a very large organization.
[01:13:27.711 --> 01:13:37.160]  It's ideologically pretty diverse, so it's hard to say what particular strain it's dominated by.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.042]  It's a membership organization.
[01:13:42.742 --> 01:13:48.084]  You essentially go to see people speak and see panel discussions and all the rest of it.
[01:13:49.545 --> 01:13:50.945]  I find it very useful.
[01:13:50.965 --> 01:13:54.107]  I've been a member there for nearly 20 years now, I think.
[01:13:54.727 --> 01:14:03.332]  But isn't it really just a giant change agent group where they get the best minds involved and then kind of start co-opting people and seeing who will play ball?
[01:14:03.352 --> 01:14:10.176]  And by the dominant group being neocons, I mean that particular strain and strata of the CFR is in government right now.
[01:14:12.838 --> 01:14:16.120]  Well, you know, I think it's kind of a complicated issue.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.601]  You know, the council
[01:14:18.394 --> 01:14:18.734]  I think.
[01:14:36.007 --> 01:14:42.830]  It's also true, though, depending on the ideology of the people who are in power, the council likes to be close to power.
[01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:52.714]  So if you have a government that's predominantly, as you say, neocon, the council will want to have high officials who share that ideology and who have access to power.
[01:14:53.094 --> 01:14:54.194]  And that has always happened.
[01:14:54.234 --> 01:14:58.416]  I don't think that's a particular ideological strain.
[01:15:01.237 --> 01:15:02.799]  Well, what was the founding principles?
[01:15:02.839 --> 01:15:04.622]  And then we'll move on in the early 1920s.
[01:15:04.722 --> 01:15:10.491]  Yeah, it was founded essentially right in the aftermath, the immediate aftermath of World War.
[01:15:11.461 --> 01:15:17.204]  One, it originally was this kind of think tank that was put together to help President Woodrow Wilson.
[01:15:17.364 --> 01:15:18.205]  League of Nations.
[01:15:18.365 --> 01:15:25.749]  In his preparation, well not just for the League, but generally his preparations for the Paris Conference and the Versailles Treaty.
[01:15:26.069 --> 01:15:30.292]  So it was kind of a think tank that was then made permanent in New York.
[01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:34.314]  Isn't it really the mirror of the Royal Institute of International Affairs?
[01:15:34.734 --> 01:15:36.815]  Yeah, there are certainly similarities.
[01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:37.756]  No question about it.
[01:15:38.436 --> 01:15:39.157]  No question about it.
[01:15:39.177 --> 01:15:41.498]  Well, I don't want to spend all day on that.
[01:15:41.999 --> 01:15:55.787]  The listeners are very interested in the CFR because, you know, they have people in there who kind of dissent from the predominant paradigm, but generally it's world government's good, world government's the answer, we've got to sacrifice our national sovereignty.
[01:15:56.127 --> 01:16:01.891]  Whether it's Republicans or Democrats, Strobe Talbot or George Bush Sr., we hear the same diatribe.
[01:16:02.251 --> 01:16:04.092]  Are you a supporter of world government?
[01:16:05.448 --> 01:16:12.135]  Well, you know, I can't help pointing out that the point you just made contradicts pretty dramatically the earlier point about neocons.
[01:16:12.155 --> 01:16:18.342]  It seems to me either it's neocon-sympathetic, as you argued a few minutes ago... Which is against the world government?
[01:16:19.323 --> 01:16:24.629]  Well, as far as I can tell, the people in power, from Rumsfeld to Paul Wolfowitz and others...
[01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:27.870]  Certainly do not believe in world government.
[01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:31.131]  They don't believe in bolstering multilateral institutions.
[01:16:31.171 --> 01:16:39.915]  They've taken points of view, notably with the Iraq war that has been flown in the face of UN decisions and UN feelings.
[01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:46.117]  But Mr. Gannard, Professor, you know full well that that's all good cop, bad cop.
[01:16:47.754 --> 01:16:50.596]  I mean, you know Bush has actually been expanding the U.N.
[01:16:50.656 --> 01:16:55.139]  funding and signing on to treaties and going ahead with the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:08.068]  Well, it's true that they certainly have different positions on trade, no question about it, but I think that their attitude toward the United Nations, with all due respect, is not good cop, bad cop.
[01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:09.670]  I mean, the decision that was made on Iraq
[01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:17.676]  was the strongest and most dramatic break with the United Nations and UN opinions that I can remember.
[01:17:17.856 --> 01:17:19.678]  And I don't think there was anything fake about it.
[01:17:20.238 --> 01:17:28.284]  I think the attitudes and the hurt feelings and the problems in relations, particularly with the European allies, are very real.
[01:17:28.585 --> 01:17:31.607]  And this was a real thing.
[01:17:31.687 --> 01:17:37.612]  And the fact that they have different views when it comes to trade policy doesn't contradict that central point.
[01:17:37.672 --> 01:17:38.773]  I mean, these issues are
[01:17:39.433 --> 01:17:40.554]  Well, let me ask this.
[01:17:40.574 --> 01:17:43.075]  Don't most members of the CFR believe in global governance?
[01:17:49.944 --> 01:17:50.844]  No, I don't think they do.
[01:17:50.864 --> 01:18:03.088]  I would say, I mean, it depends what you mean by that, but I think, you know, you have a lot of people who are fairly mistrustful of the United Nations, and some who believe it should be strengthened.
[01:18:03.128 --> 01:18:07.149]  So I think opinion in the Council is pretty divided.
[01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:12.030]  You know, you're talking about a lot of people with fairly diverse political views.
[01:18:13.691 --> 01:18:14.092]  Fair enough.
[01:18:14.132 --> 01:18:31.887]  When we get back, I want to get back into torture and I want to specifically talk about the government documents and who gave the orders for this and just how much of this torture is really going on in light of the Red Sox jet being used to fly people around, you know, the private torture jets in England, the third-party countries,
[01:18:32.547 --> 01:18:36.210]  The Army's own report that 90% of those at the camps are totally innocent.
[01:18:36.911 --> 01:18:44.918]  I want to discuss this with you and also how television is promoting torture as the new virtue and people on the left like Alan Dershowitz.
[01:18:45.498 --> 01:18:46.639]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:18:46.679 --> 01:18:47.920]  Stay with us, Mr. Danner.

[01:20:56.394 --> 01:21:02.037]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:21:02.077 --> 01:21:02.818]  Supreme Court.
[01:21:03.596 --> 01:21:07.879]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[01:21:07.919 --> 01:21:11.521]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:21:12.522 --> 01:21:17.805]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[01:21:55.054 --> 01:22:00.039]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:00.299 --> 01:22:02.901]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.101 --> 01:22:11.629]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[01:22:58.388 --> 01:23:00.289]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:03.610]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.091 --> 01:23:09.313]  Coming up in the next segment, it's your chance to talk to Mr. Danner.
[01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:16.735]  About his book, Torture and Truth, America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:16.755 --> 01:23:21.936]  That's the toll free number to join us.
[01:23:22.557 --> 01:23:24.337]  Don, Mike, and others will be getting your calls.
[01:23:25.558 --> 01:23:37.041]  Continuing, Professor Danner, you talk about documents, and we've got the General's Report, we've got the other reports, 32 camps in Iraq,
[01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:46.114]  Camps where they take people in Egypt and in Jordan and in some of the Central Asian countries.
[01:23:46.514 --> 01:23:50.136]  Camp X-Ray, a CIA camp within a camp.
[01:23:51.437 --> 01:23:54.778]  Admittedly doing things to people we can't even mention on air.
[01:23:55.579 --> 01:23:56.619]  They're so horrible.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.681]  I would imagine your book gets into that.
[01:24:00.575 --> 01:24:02.335]  Yes, it certainly does.
[01:24:02.576 --> 01:24:12.638]  It begins with the actual depositions from prisoners that were taken by the Army CID, Criminal Investigation Division, in Iraq.
[01:24:12.838 --> 01:24:16.819]  And I have the text of those depositions included in the book.
[01:24:17.599 --> 01:24:21.180]  It also includes the investigations that you spoke about.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:29.902]  And all of these things together have a great number of accounts taken from, usually in judicial type settings, so under oath.
[01:24:30.522 --> 01:24:36.848]  Taken from prisoners who were treated this way by American troops.
[01:24:37.109 --> 01:24:41.012]  There's also the troops pleading guilty.
[01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:42.154]  That's right.
[01:24:42.594 --> 01:24:45.116]  You have a number of guilty pleas.
[01:24:45.156 --> 01:24:46.698]  There's the photographic evidence.
[01:24:47.198 --> 01:24:53.625]  But, you know, the important thing to say here, I think, is that these photographs came out and suggested that this stuff was
[01:24:54.185 --> 01:24:54.966]  We're good to go.
[01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:14.805]  Well, Russ Limbaugh said that it was like a fraternity prank just blowing off steam.
[01:25:26.898 --> 01:25:33.481]  I think people with objects putting acid on them, raping women, beating people to death.
[01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:38.144]  I mean, that's called murder and torture.
[01:25:38.844 --> 01:25:44.767]  And your book, according to the synopsis, according to the stuff I've researched, this leads right back to the White House.
[01:25:44.827 --> 01:25:51.370]  I remember Rumsfeld bragging on TV about how they were, quote, pressuring people severely.
[01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:54.772]  I remember Dershowitz calling for torture right after 9-11.
[01:25:56.032 --> 01:25:56.332]  Right.
[01:25:56.853 --> 01:26:07.977]  You know, you can see, and certainly the book shows this, that after 9-11 there was a pretty dramatic change right at the top of the government about the attitude toward interrogation.
[01:26:08.037 --> 01:26:19.342]  Decisions were made by the President, by other high officials, first of all to withhold the protections of the Geneva Convention, and that debate was very vivid in the administration, but they finally decided
[01:26:20.162 --> 01:26:24.006]  For the first time in American history, not to grant Geneva Convention protection.
[01:26:24.406 --> 01:26:27.529]  And then to essentially redefine what torture is.
[01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:30.972]  The U.S., as you know, is committed not to torture.
[01:26:31.032 --> 01:26:32.833]  It's prohibited by our domestic law.
[01:26:32.853 --> 01:26:36.376]  It's prohibited by international treaties to which we're signatory.
[01:26:36.416 --> 01:26:46.165]  But there was a debate in the administration that finally resulted in a document that the Department of Justice wrote, which essentially said, you know, we may be prohibited from torturing.
[01:26:46.705 --> 01:26:48.266]  But what exactly is torture?
[01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:56.251]  Alberto Gonzales says if we torture somebody up until their organs fail and didn't mean to kill them, then it's not torture.
[01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:58.413]  And by the way, the President is the law.
[01:26:58.753 --> 01:26:59.854]  He's above the law.
[01:27:00.274 --> 01:27:01.395]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:01.435 --> 01:27:08.219]  He basically said, look, for something to be tortured to have to cause pain equivalent to major organ failure or death,
[01:27:08.739 --> 01:27:26.123]  Which means that you can do an awful lot to people, like waterboarding for example, which is submerging them underwater until they drown and then reviving them, which has been used by the CIA and apparently was explicitly approved by the Department of Justice for the CIA to use.
[01:27:26.904 --> 01:27:38.180]  And also, Mr. Dershowitz's example, which is inserting sterile needles under their fingernails, all of these things under the definition that the administration put together would not constitute torture.
[01:27:38.641 --> 01:27:43.648]  So, you know, you have a situation in which the President can say, well, no, no, we do not condone torture.
[01:27:44.188 --> 01:27:50.732]  But when he uses that word, the administration has defined it in a way that most people would not accept.
[01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:51.813]  Well, exactly.
[01:27:51.873 --> 01:27:53.394]  It's a verbal stratagem.
[01:27:54.014 --> 01:28:09.644]  And, you know, most people, if you describe waterboarding, which is, you know, you strip somebody down, you beat them up, you strap them to a board, and then you lower their head, usually upside down, into a tub of usually fetid, you know, dirty water, sometimes urine, something like that.
[01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:11.191]  It's a great question.
[01:28:28.468 --> 01:28:34.891]  Supposedly, you know, the administration can say, well, we don't torture and include the fact that... Yeah, it's like Terri Schiavo.
[01:28:35.011 --> 01:28:36.352]  It's like Terri Schiavo.
[01:28:36.392 --> 01:28:40.834]  We're not hurting her, we're just treating her by taking her water away.
[01:28:40.894 --> 01:28:41.654]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.475 --> 01:28:44.395]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.875 --> 01:28:46.476]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.397 --> 01:28:50.078]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.638 --> 01:28:55.979]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.239 --> 01:29:00.080]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.201]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.641 --> 01:29:05.742]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:05.983 --> 01:29:10.184]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.544 --> 01:29:15.426]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.806 --> 01:29:19.368]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:24.911]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.191 --> 01:29:27.932]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.233 --> 01:29:29.113]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:30:54.824 --> 01:31:00.289]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:04.954]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.194 --> 01:31:12.241]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.621 --> 01:31:18.727]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.867 --> 01:31:20.088]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:23.372]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:23.512 --> 01:31:25.534]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:33.083]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:33.384 --> 01:31:36.768]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.453]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:50.874 --> 01:31:51.514]  Call today.
[01:31:56.376 --> 01:32:02.418]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:02.999 --> 01:32:05.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:19.206]  Just to analyze what these creatures are doing, how they're trying to warp our psyche, through fiction and through the mainstream media to accept torture, we're going to play this Limbaugh clip.
[01:32:19.907 --> 01:32:23.532]  And I found another clip that's even worse, saying, so what about torture?
[01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:29.006]  I still need to get that uploaded to the network computer, but we're going to play this Limbaugh clip.
[01:32:29.126 --> 01:32:30.647]  It's about 40 seconds long.
[01:32:31.088 --> 01:32:37.773]  Here in a second, we'll go back to our guest, the author of Torture and Truth, America Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror.
[01:32:38.093 --> 01:32:40.655]  Then we'll talk to all the callers that are patiently holding.
[01:32:41.976 --> 01:32:50.924]  But before we do that, my new two and a half hour film, Marshall Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, gets into torture.
[01:32:50.984 --> 01:32:52.405]  We show the Army reports,
[01:32:53.338 --> 01:32:58.521]  How most of the people, 90% were families who didn't have their papers in order, taken to camps.
[01:32:59.401 --> 01:33:02.383]  Children at the camps, women being raped in front of their husbands.
[01:33:03.804 --> 01:33:05.845]  Doing things to people I can't mention here.
[01:33:05.865 --> 01:33:08.206]  Large objects, acid.
[01:33:09.307 --> 01:33:10.267]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:33:11.828 --> 01:33:12.969]  And this is what they admit.
[01:33:13.349 --> 01:33:16.751]  And Congress got thousands of photos and videos that the public never saw.
[01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:25.273]  CBS and kind of a psyops just released some of the lighter stuff and then, oh, dogs biting people and then sewing them up without deadening, that's just fine.
[01:33:26.194 --> 01:33:27.695]  This is only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:33:28.395 --> 01:33:31.877]  My new film, Martial Law, that's another one of the important things it covers.
[01:33:33.098 --> 01:33:34.719]  We show what really happened on 9-11.
[01:33:34.759 --> 01:33:38.221]  We show the sound wave cannons they're using in Iraq being used at the RNC.
[01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:43.544]  In New York, the secret police photographing the protesters and even mainstream media.
[01:33:44.644 --> 01:33:45.485]  The hover blimps.
[01:33:46.651 --> 01:33:49.533]  The mindlessness of the delegates at the RNC.
[01:33:49.954 --> 01:33:51.675]  The mindlessness of the left.
[01:33:52.155 --> 01:33:53.776]  Not even knowing what real issues are.
[01:33:54.697 --> 01:33:55.938]  It is such an important film.
[01:33:55.978 --> 01:33:56.899]  It's my best film.
[01:33:57.299 --> 01:34:00.561]  Go to nfowars.com to get Marshall Lobb.
[01:34:01.342 --> 01:34:04.804]  Be at a safe, secure shopping cart to order your copy, your hard copy.
[01:34:04.824 --> 01:34:10.849]  You can watch clips of the film, read about it, order it, and other videos and books right there on the side at the bookstore.
[01:34:12.125 --> 01:34:19.971]  Or call toll free to get Marshall Law, now shipping for the last two weeks.
[01:34:19.991 --> 01:34:30.038]  1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 to call and order.
[01:34:30.078 --> 01:34:31.378]  They can answer your questions when you call.
[01:34:31.759 --> 01:34:35.301]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv where you can watch my weekly TV report.
[01:34:35.922 --> 01:34:37.783]  You can listen to my best radio interviews.
[01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:49.072]  All 12 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other videos and books we've been authorized to post, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:34:49.092 --> 01:34:49.912]  15 cents a day.
[01:34:49.932 --> 01:34:51.712]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:34:52.172 --> 01:34:54.153]  You can download and burn copies of the films.
[01:34:54.613 --> 01:34:58.073]  I just want to get the information out, so PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:58.913 --> 01:35:07.815]  Before I play this Limbaugh clip, Professor Danner, tell us how we get your new book, Torture and Truth.
[01:35:08.974 --> 01:35:13.539]  Well, the book can be gotten through my website, markdanner.com.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:27.876]  It can be ordered from Amazon and Barnes & Noble and other online suppliers, but of course what I would prefer is that people go to their local bookstore where the book should be in stock, and if it's not in stock, to ask for it.
[01:35:28.957 --> 01:35:33.481]  It's from New York Review Books, and it should be widely available.
[01:35:33.521 --> 01:35:39.246]  But if there's any problem in doing that, my website will get you right there very easily, markdanner.com.
[01:35:39.606 --> 01:35:45.531]  Okay, now I want to go to calls here, but first I want to talk about the hardening of the psyche and how they're selling us
[01:35:46.151 --> 01:35:55.334]  On this evil, every cop show, every major drama, and then in the real world, all the big editorials, it's the same M.O., the same talking points.
[01:35:55.354 --> 01:36:01.896]  We now have mainstream news reports that Homeland Security's even paying off an advising threat matrix 24.
[01:36:02.756 --> 01:36:07.958]  These shows where they now torture people's children almost every episode to make them talk.
[01:36:08.298 --> 01:36:15.220]  Now torturing children is good, so I guess Joseph Mingala wasn't bad, but here's Rush Limbaugh as the change agent
[01:36:15.841 --> 01:36:20.956]  Telling his audience that it's just blowing off steam, the torture is no big deal.
[01:36:21.197 --> 01:36:21.919]  Here is that clip.
[01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:24.849]  What's psychologically wrong with that?
[01:36:25.289 --> 01:36:32.753]  It's not the act so much, it was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked men and... Exactly!
[01:36:33.194 --> 01:36:34.774]  Exactly my point!
[01:36:35.095 --> 01:36:45.941]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're gonna ruin people's lives over it, and we're gonna hamper our military effort, and then we're gonna really hammer them because they had a good time.
[01:36:47.782 --> 01:36:48.042]  You know,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.120]  These people are being fired at every day.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.641]  I'm talking about the people having a good time.
[01:36:52.981 --> 01:36:55.461]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[01:36:56.501 --> 01:36:58.462]  You ever heard of you to blow some steam off?
[01:37:00.122 --> 01:37:04.643]  So there's the clip, and others have called for outright torturing them.
[01:37:04.963 --> 01:37:11.484]  I've heard it on talk radio saying it's good, but Alan Dershowitz is off calling it a great American value.
[01:37:12.524 --> 01:37:16.005]  Truly, we see the attempt to mass-warp the psyche
[01:37:17.135 --> 01:37:32.340]  And then people accept that torture isn't torture, and then we hear reports of a guy's chained down in a hospital bed, he won't give a urine sample on demand, so they taser him, and the police just go, this is our new policy, it isn't torture, it's just pressure.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:33.440]  Professor?
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:39.082]  Well, I'm very glad you played the quote from Russ Limbaugh.
[01:37:39.783 --> 01:37:43.305]  I think basically what it shows is ignorance, first of all.
[01:37:43.705 --> 01:37:48.027]  I mean, what he describes as fraternity hazing, that's just not the case.
[01:37:48.087 --> 01:37:49.948]  This stuff went on for days and days.
[01:37:50.288 --> 01:37:51.669]  It was highly organized.
[01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:54.750]  It began with beatings, extensive beatings.
[01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:59.853]  People were beaten into unconsciousness in a fairly systematic way.
[01:38:00.694 --> 01:38:03.355]  People were injured in such a way they had to go to the hospital.
[01:38:04.573 --> 01:38:07.589]  They were bitten very severely on their legs by dogs.
[01:38:08.283 --> 01:38:10.244]  One man's ear was nearly torn off.
[01:38:10.924 --> 01:38:19.268]  Now, people were also, people were beaten to death, then they'd pack ice on them, put a fake IV on them, and take them out the front door.
[01:38:19.668 --> 01:38:20.329]  That's right.
[01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:34.455]  At this point, the Army has officially admitted, the American military, I should say, has officially admitted that 27 detainees have died under interrogation, and these are the detainees that those are considered homicides.
[01:38:35.315 --> 01:38:40.178]  The total number of deaths in detainment situations now is over 70.
[01:38:40.498 --> 01:38:42.979]  Now let's be clear, that's what they admit.
[01:38:43.019 --> 01:38:51.723]  There's 32 camps in Iraq, a dozen in Afghanistan, two camps at Guantanamo Bay, and camps in at least five other third-party countries.
[01:38:52.164 --> 01:39:00.648]  Did you see the Washington Post article in late 2001 where they have the CIA section chief over the Middle East as quoted as saying, we take them to Egypt,
[01:39:01.148 --> 01:39:06.096]  And Jordan, where we can torture them and pressure their families in front of them?
[01:39:07.017 --> 01:39:08.058]  Uh, yeah, I did see that.
[01:39:08.078 --> 01:39:10.382]  I think that was 2002, but yes, I did see it.
[01:39:10.402 --> 01:39:10.722]  Okay, early 2002.
[01:39:10.963 --> 01:39:12.325]  I've got it in the film, but...
[01:39:12.859 --> 01:39:13.719]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:13.779 --> 01:39:19.582]  Well, you know, a lot of this stuff is on the record, you know, which is one of the points of my book, Torture and Treatment.
[01:39:19.602 --> 01:39:21.903]  But it's not torture if we don't kill them on purpose.
[01:39:22.743 --> 01:39:26.084]  Yes, that's right, if they're killed accidentally.
[01:39:26.525 --> 01:39:32.007]  So if I go up and beat somebody with a baseball bat and didn't mean to kill them, I can just say I was blowing off steam with the cops?
[01:39:32.811 --> 01:39:42.093]  Well, under their definition of torture, if your main point is not to cause extensive pain, then in fact it's not torture.
[01:39:42.713 --> 01:39:43.693]  That's under their definition.
[01:39:43.713 --> 01:39:48.334]  But I think the important thing to underline about what Mr. Limbaugh said is that it's simply not true.
[01:39:48.354 --> 01:39:49.654]  It's factually wrong.
[01:39:49.714 --> 01:39:52.074]  It's not a question of how he's interpreting things.
[01:39:52.535 --> 01:39:55.135]  He's got it wrong what actually happened.
[01:39:55.555 --> 01:39:56.995]  And we know what actually happened.
[01:39:57.015 --> 01:39:58.176]  The documents have come out.
[01:39:58.216 --> 01:39:59.036]  You can read them.
[01:39:59.376 --> 01:40:00.636]  They're there in black and white.
[01:40:01.176 --> 01:40:05.761]  And, you know, he relies on the fact that nobody is going to read anything that they're just going to listen to him.
[01:40:06.882 --> 01:40:11.186]  And so he can say this and basically say things that are absolutely contrary.
[01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:16.651]  Well, yeah, I've heard him say that Bush is not for amnesty when Bush has openly said he's for open borders and amnesty.
[01:40:17.012 --> 01:40:21.256]  Yeah, well, he does and there is a certain technique here which is simply to tell people
[01:40:22.096 --> 01:40:28.260]  A story that seems to fit together itself and to count on the fact that they're not going to check it and you essentially tell them what they want to hear.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.463]  Well, I'm blown away by these people because, Professor, all I do is read government documents and what is admitted.
[01:40:32.884 --> 01:40:39.268]  And I'm telling you, the liberals, the conservatives, they're all up there together basically for all this stuff and they're all a bunch of liars.
[01:40:40.168 --> 01:40:46.673]  Well, I think it's true that, you know, there is a lot of lying going on on these things, there's no question.
[01:40:46.693 --> 01:40:57.101]  I think it's also true that a lot of this stuff is coming out, that the documentary evidence is coming out, and that increasingly, you know, the truth is getting into the public sphere.
[01:40:57.201 --> 01:40:59.683]  So I wouldn't lose hope on this.
[01:40:59.864 --> 01:41:04.187]  It's just that, you know, it's taking a long time to get out and to change people's opinion.
[01:41:04.227 --> 01:41:05.688]  But I think it will happen.
[01:41:05.968 --> 01:41:08.250]  I think we're heading in that direction.
[01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:11.251]  Clearly, Professor, there is an agenda.
[01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:15.432]  Homeland Security head Reg and now Chertoff have met with the media.
[01:41:16.552 --> 01:41:20.353]  They're consulting and we've got all these paid-for press releases.
[01:41:21.513 --> 01:41:24.394]  We know that they are literally writing some of the scripts.
[01:41:24.834 --> 01:41:27.674]  We've read these articles on air for these TV shows.
[01:41:27.734 --> 01:41:35.536]  Every time I turn it on, they're now not just torturing the, quote, terrorists on these fiction shows, they're torturing seven, eight-year-old children.
[01:41:36.307 --> 01:41:39.590]  And this is a concerted effort to warp our minds.
[01:41:40.891 --> 01:41:43.372]  Yes, well, I think that's true.
[01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:49.377]  I don't know, but I'll take your word for it, the degree of administration involvement and consulting on these scripts.
[01:41:50.318 --> 01:42:05.169]  It's also true, you know, that when people feel anxiety about their safety, when people are bewildered about why the country's been attacked and so on, you get the mass media, and in particular the commercial media, television,
[01:42:05.829 --> 01:42:08.832]  Responding by trying to satisfy those kinds of anxieties.
[01:42:08.892 --> 01:42:13.636]  And I think you see that when you see some of these commercial programs that show torture.
[01:42:13.716 --> 01:42:26.128]  That is, you know, in the way of Dirty Harry, the Clint Eastwood movie, trying to take a public that's worried about crime, that's worried about being attacked, and showing them justice being delivered.
[01:42:26.188 --> 01:42:27.849]  And I think there's a lot of that going on.
[01:42:27.869 --> 01:42:29.691]  But what people don't understand is,
[01:42:30.351 --> 01:42:39.337]  Is that cops now, since they've been doing this the last three years, suddenly instances of torture by the police against innocent people is way up.
[01:42:40.278 --> 01:42:44.461]  There aren't real Al-C-I-A-T-I-S folks running around that are going to get us.
[01:42:45.321 --> 01:42:53.166]  Terrorism is actually at lows, child kidnappings at lows, crime is at lows right now, all time lows.
[01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:57.770]  It is this perception and torture isn't going to keep you safe.
[01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:59.771]  Listen, I want to go to calls, but I've just got
[01:43:00.612 --> 01:43:03.534]  One other comment, and then I want you to comment on it, Professor.
[01:43:03.554 --> 01:43:07.998]  We're talking to Mark Danner, author of this new book, Torture and Truth.
[01:43:08.979 --> 01:43:21.109]  Look, the types of sexual perversion at Abu Ghraib and Camp X-Ray, admittedly associated with this, the types of things they're doing, I've only seen this with serial killers.
[01:43:21.509 --> 01:43:26.794]  So even if sickos out there go, we gotta torture them to get answers, why is it all sexually perverted?
[01:43:27.678 --> 01:43:40.244]  Well, I think that there's a perception that one of the areas of sensitivity when it comes to Middle Eastern, particularly Arab culture, is a shame about sexual matters, and in particular, a shame about nudity.
[01:43:40.824 --> 01:43:50.369]  And you can see, pervasively, if you look at what's happened to individual people, not only in Abu Ghraib, but there are instances where Arab journalists have been harassed.
[01:43:50.569 --> 01:43:54.411]  Yeah, but these guards are raping women in front of the men because they like it.
[01:43:55.313 --> 01:43:58.596]  Well, I don't dispute that some of them may like it.
[01:43:58.636 --> 01:44:00.357]  It's a tough job, but I've got to do it.
[01:44:00.377 --> 01:44:11.726]  I'm trying to answer your question, which is that it seems to me that a lot of this stuff is systemic, and it's trying to point to particular sensitivities, cultural sensitivities, on the part of Arab men.
[01:44:11.806 --> 01:44:12.527]  The fact that they
[01:44:13.428 --> 01:44:18.753]  It's very unusual and indeed forbidden for men to see one another naked in Arab culture.
[01:44:19.534 --> 01:44:24.239]  Things having to do with bathroom stuff and so on is done very secretly.
[01:44:24.259 --> 01:44:26.621]  It's very private.
[01:44:27.142 --> 01:44:36.111]  And you can tell in the way these torture procedures operate that there's been a clear study of the sensitivities of Arab culture.
[01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:42.995]  No, I agree with you, but then the feds also go and they hire former prison guards with bad records who enjoy doing this.
[01:44:45.837 --> 01:44:49.860]  Yes, there's no question that some of these people clearly were enjoying themselves.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:50.880]  You can see it.
[01:44:51.921 --> 01:44:54.042]  In beating people to death and raping people.
[01:44:54.102 --> 01:44:54.803]  Folks, come on.
[01:44:55.803 --> 01:44:57.564]  Let's take some calls.
[01:44:57.905 --> 01:44:59.065]  Don in Missouri.
[01:44:59.105 --> 01:44:59.786]  Don, you're on the air.
[01:44:59.846 --> 01:45:00.426]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:00.786 --> 01:45:02.648]  Yeah, I think it's all one cloth.
[01:45:03.668 --> 01:45:04.449]  Listen, I wanted to
[01:45:05.322 --> 01:45:18.145]  To touch upon the Schiavo case again, you know, I haven't been able to listen the last week or so, so I don't know if you've explored this already, but this behavior of Michael Schiavo is just so bizarre, and all these powerful people covering up for him.
[01:45:18.865 --> 01:45:26.367]  The only explanation I can come up for it is that since Florida's crawling with CIA agents, that maybe he's an agent, and Terry was his slave.
[01:45:27.107 --> 01:45:32.508]  And that now the government is caught in this public relations nightmare, and they're scrambling to try to
[01:45:33.413 --> 01:45:36.355]  We're willing to kill her in public just to cover this up.
[01:46:04.154 --> 01:46:04.975]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:46:05.615 --> 01:46:12.062]  People, certainly it's been in the press, that law that then-Governor Bush passed.
[01:46:12.122 --> 01:46:14.944]  I just killed a little baby two days ago, by the way, but go ahead.
[01:46:14.964 --> 01:46:17.607]  Yes, yes, I saw that in the news.
[01:46:18.007 --> 01:46:27.297]  And there's clearly a very high degree of contradiction here between what people say and the political positions they take, particularly in the Schiavo case and what they've actually done.
[01:46:28.157 --> 01:46:32.380]  In their political history and in their own lives, for that matter, when it comes to Tom DeLay, for example.
[01:46:33.241 --> 01:46:41.707]  So, we see those contradictions very dramatically, and it shows, in this case, a lot of politicians are looking at it simply as a lucrative political target.
[01:46:41.747 --> 01:46:46.871]  You know, this is going to help me firm up my position with the evangelical right.
[01:46:47.671 --> 01:46:49.052]  And the left likes it, too.
[01:46:49.112 --> 01:46:50.674]  Mike in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:46:50.714 --> 01:46:51.074]  Go ahead.
[01:46:51.781 --> 01:47:02.588]  Yeah, speaking of contradictions, you know, I saw that clip of that slimeball Jack Wheeler from the Freedom Foundation saying how we should
[01:47:05.777 --> 01:47:07.178]  It just frees everyone's lungs.
[01:47:07.618 --> 01:47:11.940]  And then when they're about ready to die, then we'll make them breathe again.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.502]  You know, that's basically high-tech tabling.
[01:47:16.443 --> 01:47:22.426]  I've actually got that clip in Police State's Free Total Enslavement where they're on national TV saying how good torture is.
[01:47:22.446 --> 01:47:22.987]  Exactly.
[01:47:23.007 --> 01:47:26.949]  And it's just trying to... it's just justifying everything.
[01:47:28.610 --> 01:47:34.053]  But another reason I want to talk to you, Alex, is that I'm sure you're familiar with
[01:47:36.138 --> 01:47:46.085]  The 1997 act where Queen Elizabeth enhanced the social security?
[01:47:48.787 --> 01:47:49.688]  I'm not reading you.
[01:47:49.788 --> 01:47:50.769]  I'm not understanding.
[01:47:50.989 --> 01:47:55.592]  Well, there was a... It was a... Oh, what's it called?
[01:47:57.422 --> 01:47:58.383]  I really don't know, sir.
[01:47:58.483 --> 01:48:00.505]  I... Queen Elizabeth, Social Security.
[01:48:00.765 --> 01:48:12.316]  Yeah, well, in 1997 they did a... there was a... in England, Queen Elizabeth controls and amended the U.S.
[01:48:12.356 --> 01:48:12.977]  Social Security.
[01:48:14.048 --> 01:48:16.129]  Under 1997 number 1778.
[01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:18.750]  I wasn't aware of that.
[01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:21.211]  You'll have to send me some information on that.
[01:48:21.591 --> 01:48:25.853]  Oh yeah, Queen Elizabeth amended our social security back in 1997.
[01:48:25.913 --> 01:48:28.855]  Well, you'll have to send me some information on that, Mike.
[01:48:29.715 --> 01:48:31.216]  It's all over the web.
[01:48:31.436 --> 01:48:31.736]  Really?
[01:48:31.896 --> 01:48:35.938]  Yeah, and it pretty much just points it out that we're basically
[01:48:36.952 --> 01:48:38.713]  Run by England.
[01:48:38.993 --> 01:48:39.374]  I hear you.
[01:48:39.414 --> 01:48:40.054]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:40.734 --> 01:48:42.215]  Let's talk to Eric in Oklahoma.
[01:48:42.255 --> 01:48:43.036]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:48:43.056 --> 01:48:43.456]  Go ahead.
[01:48:43.616 --> 01:48:44.397]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:45.257]  How are you doing?
[01:48:45.277 --> 01:48:45.437]  Good.
[01:48:45.537 --> 01:48:46.138]  Good to talk to you.
[01:48:46.158 --> 01:48:46.658]  What's on your mind?
[01:48:46.958 --> 01:48:47.879]  I have Mark Ganner.
[01:48:47.959 --> 01:48:49.880]  I listen to Mark a lot.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.623]  He's one of the few intellectually honest people that I've heard on the media.
[01:48:55.084 --> 01:48:59.546]  Mark, I look at everything through the eyes of dialectical materialism.
[01:48:59.646 --> 01:49:01.448]  Everything is the dialectic these days.
[01:49:01.928 --> 01:49:04.089]  There's the pro, the con, the right, the left.
[01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.309]  Yeah.
[01:49:05.650 --> 01:49:10.391]  Lately, it seems like instead of just left and right, it's like a pinwheel.
[01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:14.092]  People take a position and then it's being spun.
[01:49:14.772 --> 01:49:17.612]  So, it's no longer about the right or left.
[01:49:17.632 --> 01:49:19.032]  It's really about right and wrong.
[01:49:19.232 --> 01:49:22.773]  And they're trying to blur the distinction between right and wrong.
[01:49:23.293 --> 01:49:24.893]  Well, that's what change agents do.
[01:49:24.933 --> 01:49:28.834]  That's what MKUltra was about, was how to change the views of Americans.
[01:49:29.174 --> 01:49:30.874]  That's right, and that's why we're in trouble.
[01:49:30.894 --> 01:49:31.475]  Stay there, Eric.
[01:49:31.755 --> 01:49:33.815]  We'll come back and let the professor
[01:49:34.495 --> 01:49:38.360]  Comment on your statement and let you finish up as well.
[01:49:39.001 --> 01:49:41.985]  Final segment with a professor coming up in the third hour.
[01:49:42.405 --> 01:49:44.608]  A ton of news and wide open telephones.
[01:49:45.349 --> 01:49:46.571]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:49:46.711 --> 01:49:50.656]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:57.662]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.842 --> 01:50:02.264]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.404 --> 01:50:06.805]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.845 --> 01:50:08.166]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.986 --> 01:50:10.328]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:34.210]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:39.714]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:05.303]  Rumsfeld gets up on TV and says, I never said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[01:53:05.363 --> 01:53:07.044]  It's a conspiracy theory and urban legend.
[01:53:09.346 --> 01:53:11.087]  And now they say they never called for torture.
[01:53:11.208 --> 01:53:17.612]  It isn't torture if we beat and brutalize and drown somebody until they die if we didn't mean to kill them.
[01:53:18.833 --> 01:53:22.856]  I mean, I guess serial killers should try that when they get called a bunch of dead bodies.
[01:53:22.876 --> 01:53:23.917]  Well, I didn't mean to kill them.
[01:53:24.458 --> 01:53:25.599]  Oh, well, then go free then.
[01:53:25.619 --> 01:53:27.460]  Well, these are terrorists.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:28.481]  They don't have the same rights.
[01:53:28.541 --> 01:53:29.121]  Come on, folks.
[01:53:29.141 --> 01:53:30.062]  They're not even terrorists.
[01:53:30.874 --> 01:53:31.934]  This is all by design.
[01:53:33.235 --> 01:53:43.579]  Professor, comments to what Eric in Oklahoma was just saying about just both political parties in this whole system?
[01:53:45.019 --> 01:53:50.081]  Well, first of all, I was grateful to Eric for his kind comments about my work.
[01:53:50.121 --> 01:53:51.002]  I appreciate that.
[01:53:53.262 --> 01:53:58.584]  You know, his comments were, I thought, very provocative, but also very broad.
[01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:00.005]  I think he's right that
[01:54:00.623 --> 01:54:08.326]  You know, the things that we had taken for granted for many years about the left and the right have gotten twisted and very confusing.
[01:54:08.386 --> 01:54:18.710]  On the one hand, the political spectrum has moved far to the right when you look at what's going on in Washington, and we're seeing things that would have been really unheard of years ago.
[01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:23.132]  I mean, one of the reasons I wrote this book, Torture and Truth, was because I
[01:54:24.173 --> 01:54:32.718]  We're seeing Americans undertake acts of torture that I used to cover in Latin America twenty years ago, twenty-five years ago.
[01:54:32.738 --> 01:54:34.979]  You say move to the right.
[01:54:35.279 --> 01:54:39.701]  I mean, record budgets, 2.6 trillion, open borders.
[01:54:39.962 --> 01:54:47.786]  Very good point, which I was going to get to, which is that at the same time as you have a defiantly right-wing agenda,
[01:54:48.456 --> 01:55:07.929]  You also have, particularly on the financial fiscal side, the spending side, the fact that the government came into office, supposedly a very conservative administration, with a budget surplus of over $200 billion and has changed that into a budget deficit of nearly $500 billion.
[01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:13.813]  It's been the largest shift in the fiscal status of the government in the history of the United States.
[01:55:14.553 --> 01:55:18.536]  And by the way, most of that extra expenditure is not even military.
[01:55:18.576 --> 01:55:24.361]  It's all the classic big government control, social welfare garbage.
[01:55:24.381 --> 01:55:25.441]  Let's take another call.
[01:55:26.082 --> 01:55:27.483]  Let's talk to Barney in Maryland.
[01:55:27.523 --> 01:55:29.905]  Barney, you're on the air with our CFR member.
[01:55:29.945 --> 01:55:30.325]  Go ahead.
[01:55:32.086 --> 01:55:32.807]  Go ahead, Barney.
[01:55:34.148 --> 01:55:35.329]  Barney, come to your telephone.
[01:55:35.869 --> 01:55:36.349]  You with me?
[01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:36.930]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:38.471 --> 01:55:42.254]  This might seem radical, but once you've been to war, it fits.
[01:55:43.252 --> 01:55:53.665]  I believe that in Iraq, same as the wars in Korea and Vietnam, the purpose is to take us down to a fourth world country.
[01:55:54.426 --> 01:55:57.630]  That there is a planned economic crisis.
[01:55:58.345 --> 01:56:01.086]  That millions of American people will be killed?
[01:56:01.466 --> 01:56:02.106]  No, you're right.
[01:56:02.166 --> 01:56:11.769]  The globalists use America as the imperial model to grab and consolidate more countries under IMF or World Bank control than Europe comes in, like the good cop.
[01:56:11.809 --> 01:56:13.930]  But the professor, I think, disagrees with that.
[01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:25.713]  Well, I believe that in the end, the patriots and the fascists and the captive nations around the world and the United States are going to win by eliminating all of one world.
[01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:28.370]  Professor, final comments?
[01:56:29.871 --> 01:56:37.872]  Well, I'm not... I don't know about reducing America to fourth world status.
[01:56:37.892 --> 01:56:47.974]  I think, as a master plan, I don't think what the Bush administration has done seems to fit in, at least in my view, with that.
[01:56:48.274 --> 01:56:50.015]  Oh, they're driving down the dollar?
[01:56:50.435 --> 01:56:52.635]  They're de-industrializing us?
[01:56:53.716 --> 01:56:55.516]  All of this looks like looting, Professor.
[01:56:56.236 --> 01:57:04.242]  Well, they are driving down the dollar, that's quite true, which is one of the ways, of course, to deal with the enormous debt that they've got.
[01:57:04.262 --> 01:57:05.142]  Hidden inflation, yeah.
[01:57:05.342 --> 01:57:13.328]  The Reagan administration did it as well, but I think that's a far cry from talking about, you know, a fourth world country.
[01:57:13.368 --> 01:57:15.389]  There's a major shift of income.
[01:57:16.599 --> 01:57:17.199]  We're good to go.
[01:57:49.492 --> 01:57:50.132]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.813 --> 01:57:51.834]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.574 --> 01:57:53.675]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.316 --> 01:57:55.176]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.917 --> 01:57:56.857]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.478 --> 01:58:01.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.661 --> 01:58:05.804]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.746 --> 01:58:12.489]  Well, we can certainly see the global government agenda.
[01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:14.731]  Eugenics being promoted in America.
[01:58:17.819 --> 01:58:24.101]  The transponder tracked toll roads now going in all over the country.
[01:58:25.781 --> 01:58:30.223]  The free trade area of the Americas and the Union of American States forming.
[01:58:30.263 --> 01:58:34.844]  It's all over the Canadian and Mexican papers that people don't want to give up their sovereignty.
[01:58:35.464 --> 01:58:40.246]  But the average American has no idea that these treaties are even being put into effect right now.
[01:58:42.086 --> 01:58:44.387]  The globalists want to invade Iran and Syria.
[01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:53.943]  They're setting up world taxation, world regulation, and the world knows about it, but the average American doesn't, though they're starting to wake up.
[01:58:54.863 --> 01:59:07.446]  And somebody for over two decades that's been on the front lines of exposing the global controllers is Jim Tucker at AmericanFreePress.net, formerly The Spotlight.
[01:59:08.547 --> 01:59:10.067]  And he has snuck through drainage
[01:59:10.808 --> 01:59:17.834]  Ditches, he's climbed over fences, he's posed as hotel workers all over Europe and the U.S.
[01:59:18.374 --> 01:59:32.065]  to sneak into these events and he always gets us this incredible forecasting of what's going to happen in the next year according to what his spies and others get him inside the Bilderberg Group meetings.
[01:59:32.125 --> 01:59:40.252]  Now, up until about four years ago, you talk about Bilderberg Group, the mainstream news would say it doesn't exist, you're insane.
[01:59:41.497 --> 01:59:54.865]  Now it's been all over the news, BBC, you name it, Reuters, admitting that the world's royalty and elites do meet in secret, the military does guard them, but still, you're a conspiracy theorist of your concern.
[01:59:55.985 --> 01:59:59.247]  And joining us for the next hour, and we'll be taking your calls, is Jim Tucker.
[01:59:59.608 --> 02:00:01.689]  Jim, thanks for coming on during your busy schedule.
[02:00:02.269 --> 02:00:03.290]  Oh, it's always a pleasure.
[02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:08.933]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but just in a nutshell for those who just joined us, what is the Bilderberg Group?
[02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:12.871]  Well, Bilderberg Group has met under that name since 1954.
[02:00:14.372 --> 02:00:15.712]  Already 51 years.
[02:00:16.653 --> 02:00:20.334]  They took their name very much as Shakespeare named As You Like It.
[02:00:20.874 --> 02:00:26.457]  They happened to be meeting secretly at the Bilderberg Hotel in Usterbeck.
[02:00:27.597 --> 02:00:30.038]  And so they said we have to start meeting regularly now.
[02:00:30.478 --> 02:00:31.899]  They call themselves Bilderberg Group.
[02:00:32.539 --> 02:00:36.081]  There have been meetings like that going on for decades and decades.
[02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:38.362]  Most notably about 1913 or something when
[02:00:40.245 --> 02:00:47.149]  They met off Jekyll Island and decided to introduce the income tax amendment to the Constitution, which they did.
[02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:55.575]  The same subtle way the working man would not pay anything, because you paid nothing until you made $4,000 a year.
[02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:57.816]  That was more than the average working man made.
[02:00:58.556 --> 02:01:00.698]  So they sold it on make the rich pay something.
[02:01:00.718 --> 02:01:05.921]  I'm still proud of the very late great Senator Harry Byrd of my state of Virginia.
[02:01:06.801 --> 02:01:07.521]  He was a governor.
[02:01:07.541 --> 02:01:10.942]  He was in the House and the State Senate at the time that passed.
[02:01:11.563 --> 02:01:16.704]  And he made a notable speech saying, he talked about tax adjustments now.
[02:01:17.404 --> 02:01:19.665]  In future generations, they'll tax the working man.
[02:01:20.225 --> 02:01:22.506]  He talked about 1% tax now.
[02:01:23.026 --> 02:01:25.507]  We may even see a 5% tax.
[02:01:25.907 --> 02:01:29.988]  The old attitude is that Virginia never did ratify the Income Tax Amendment.
[02:01:30.749 --> 02:01:34.830]  He warned then that Internal Revenue Agents would be in the kitchens of American families.
[02:01:35.948 --> 02:01:42.651]  So, they are the lineal descendants of these groups who met infrequently during those years.
[02:01:43.552 --> 02:01:56.358]  And they plan, as you have mentioned, they plan the world, the future of the world, the world government, the direct tax by the UN has been a very important part of their agenda for several years now.
[02:01:56.998 --> 02:02:00.740]  And three such proposals are pending even as we speak before the United Nations.
[02:02:01.461 --> 02:02:04.242]  Their favorite one being a tax on oil at the wellhead, which means
[02:02:04.969 --> 02:02:10.912]  When you buy gasoline for your car, you're paying directly to the UN a tax.
[02:02:12.413 --> 02:02:18.596]  Or when you buy oil or fuel for any purpose, to heat your home or whatever, you are paying a direct tax to the United Nations.
[02:02:18.776 --> 02:02:19.597]  It's a tax.
[02:02:20.217 --> 02:02:21.258]  Alright, we're going to break.
[02:02:21.278 --> 02:02:22.798]  We're going to come back with Jim Tucker.
[02:02:22.839 --> 02:02:26.520]  If you want to talk to him later in the shower, go ahead and get lined up.
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:26.600]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:31.718 --> 02:02:33.883]  There's an upcoming Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:02:34.204 --> 02:02:35.887]  They also have steering group meetings.
[02:02:36.569 --> 02:02:41.439]  And really, the intel he gets from inside is an accurate crystal ball.
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:42.341]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.873 --> 02:02:46.355]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.555 --> 02:02:49.638]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:49.758 --> 02:02:53.662]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:53.722 --> 02:02:57.966]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.286 --> 02:03:02.070]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:04.012]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.612 --> 02:03:07.514]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:07.554 --> 02:03:12.258]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:15.460]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:18.482]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:18.982 --> 02:03:25.107]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:25.647 --> 02:03:29.432]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:03:57.371 --> 02:04:02.036]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:02.496 --> 02:04:09.219]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:09.619 --> 02:04:21.404]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:04:46.657 --> 02:04:50.497]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:50.818 --> 02:04:51.638]  Read the labels.
[02:04:52.058 --> 02:04:56.179]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:56.419 --> 02:05:00.600]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:05.841]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:06.241 --> 02:05:09.783]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:06:01.638 --> 02:06:08.101]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:11.082 --> 02:06:16.145]  Alright, 8 minutes, 27 seconds into the second hour, second segment.
[02:06:17.407 --> 02:06:18.047]  of this hour.
[02:06:18.748 --> 02:06:34.096]  Jim Tucker, respected journalist, worked for some of the biggest newspapers in the country, but about 25 years ago he learned of the Bilderberg Group, an organization sworn to create world government, world taxation, world regulation and control.
[02:06:34.877 --> 02:06:46.523]  As he was saying in the last segment, they're just offshoots of the same families that met in 1913, that's now public, to set up our income tax, and then to give us the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve,
[02:06:47.914 --> 02:07:13.935]  Jim literally has snuck through drainage pipes, climbed over walls, posed as hotel staff to get into these resorts, these five-star hotels, and to get their documents to expose what the heads of banking, the media, the royal families of the world, the Henry Kissingers are all there basically scheming to set up.
[02:07:15.416 --> 02:07:16.797]  And I guess for about the last
[02:07:17.677 --> 02:07:18.618]  Seven years.
[02:07:19.579 --> 02:07:25.466]  I've been having Jim on before and after he goes to the Bilderberg Group meetings, always in a different spot.
[02:07:26.848 --> 02:07:30.172]  Generally in Europe, but occasionally here in the United States.
[02:07:31.053 --> 02:07:32.695]  And he comes on beforehand.
[02:07:32.715 --> 02:07:36.319]  He a lot of times has a list of who's going to be going, from his sources.
[02:07:36.599 --> 02:07:37.821]  This is real intelligence work.
[02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:47.393]  He then gets there, meets with some of the locals, meets at local bars and restaurants, talks to people that are working inside.
[02:07:47.413 --> 02:08:02.221]  They normally don't agree to help him, but after they see how rude the Globalists are, and hear some of the stuff the Globalists are saying and doing as they're serving them their champagne, and serving them out on the golf courses, they then come to Jim and give him lots of data and info.
[02:08:02.801 --> 02:08:06.623]  And of course he's been detained by police before, he's been chased,
[02:08:07.556 --> 02:08:11.479]  By the security forces, the military generally guards these people.
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:20.306]  Jim, is that kind of a fair thumbnail sketch of some of the adventures you've been on?
[02:08:20.646 --> 02:08:24.529]  Yes, that sums up Little Hobby very nicely.
[02:08:27.051 --> 02:08:32.916]  For those that just joined us, just briefly again in any areas you didn't cover, what is the Bilderberg Group?
[02:08:33.276 --> 02:08:34.777]  Why should we be concerned about it?
[02:08:34.857 --> 02:08:35.898]  And then the second part,
[02:08:36.599 --> 02:08:39.500]  Five years ago, my friend, the media said it didn't exist.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:41.900]  You've been covering it for 20-plus years.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:44.460]  Why now are they having to admit it exists?
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:45.241]  Those two questions.
[02:08:45.401 --> 02:08:48.721]  So many letters and inquiries from their readers.
[02:08:49.201 --> 02:09:01.463]  For example, after the last meeting, the New York Times had a cutesy little story about how these chaps have this innocent little meeting that makes the right wing so hysterical.
[02:09:02.544 --> 02:09:05.044]  They've attended these meetings from the very outset.
[02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:07.771]  The coverage in Europe is extensive.
[02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:12.154]  The blackout in the United States remains largely intact.
[02:09:12.194 --> 02:09:14.636]  I think the Washington Post even did a little thing.
[02:09:15.156 --> 02:09:22.442]  The only time that the word Bilderberg had ever been mentioned before in the New York Times was when one of those old gooks decided to die at one of the meetings.
[02:09:22.942 --> 02:09:25.784]  Now he was of course an international banker.
[02:09:26.284 --> 02:09:34.491]  His name escapes me that he was some kind of international banker from Europe and so they carried the news a little bit more than just
[02:09:35.942 --> 02:09:36.523]  We're good to go.
[02:09:59.831 --> 02:10:07.354]  Doing a roundup of all the big activities being taken out of Austria because they're mad at Austrians for having a free election.
[02:10:08.074 --> 02:10:12.095]  And George Heider did well in that election, so they were all mad.
[02:10:12.775 --> 02:10:16.156]  They were supposed to meet at Telf near Innsbruck, originally scheduled.
[02:10:17.257 --> 02:10:26.560]  And to show solidarity, they cancelled Telf and went to a place near Brussels where they had the worst accommodations they've ever known because even
[02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:47.518]  As powerful as they are, it's difficult to say to a major hotel, you will clean out the hotel of all other guests, and you will have your staff carefully screened for security purposes, they will wear tags, and they will be briefed and told that they'll be fired if they leak any information, all that intimidation.
[02:10:48.218 --> 02:10:53.720]  So they sort of made themselves uncomfortable that year by boycotting Austria.
[02:10:58.567 --> 02:11:00.268]  But we don't know where they're meeting this year.
[02:11:00.288 --> 02:11:03.210]  I stay nervous as a struggling church until we find out.
[02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:07.092]  But I feel confident that we will.
[02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:10.094]  Well, you've always learned in the past.
[02:11:10.214 --> 02:11:11.835]  When is the new meeting coming up?
[02:11:12.355 --> 02:11:13.716]  That's what I'm still trying to find out.
[02:11:14.737 --> 02:11:22.101]  Very likely June because the G8 Summit of Heads of State takes place
[02:11:24.783 --> 02:11:36.532]  In Scotland, a little late this year, about July the 14th, they generally meet a week or two prior to the G8 meeting so they can get their instructions ready for the heads of state.
[02:11:38.613 --> 02:11:44.879]  Now, for those who just joined us, there are groups like the CFR with 2,300 members, 2,500 members.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:49.243]  There are groups like Trilateral with a couple hundred, 500 or so.
[02:11:49.984 --> 02:11:54.589]  Bilderberg Group is, of the organizations out there, the most exclusive
[02:11:55.389 --> 02:11:56.250]  That we know of.
[02:11:56.330 --> 02:12:02.234]  How many people generally attend, that are members, and then how many guests do we normally see at the Bilderberg Group Conferences?
[02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:20.967]  Well, there's on average, I'd say there's 115 regulars, Kissingers, Rockefellers, and so forth, and those who represent whatever party is in power in Washington, like Rumsfeld attended as Board's Chief of Staff.
[02:12:21.007 --> 02:12:24.009]  He's attended as Secretary of State.
[02:12:24.825 --> 02:12:34.429]  And high officials always in the State Department and Defense Department attend these meetings representing the President.
[02:12:35.730 --> 02:12:37.251]  And there's very close associations.
[02:12:37.771 --> 02:12:49.516]  For instance, when the obscure Governor of Arkansas attended the meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany in 1991, we figured there may be a bright future, political future, for that little fat feller.
[02:12:49.936 --> 02:12:50.656]  Now you said that.
[02:12:50.957 --> 02:12:54.078]  In the next year, the following year, he is elected President of the United States.
[02:12:55.405 --> 02:13:03.734]  It was that occasion they took a little Bill Clinton out to the golf course and David Rockefeller explained to him what NAFTA was and why he's for it.
[02:13:04.314 --> 02:13:07.117]  And you saw a big champion of NAFTA sitting in the White House.
[02:13:08.018 --> 02:13:15.206]  In fairness, both parties favor these what they call free trade agreements rather than fair trade agreements.
[02:13:17.302 --> 02:13:37.592]  Now, Jim, talking about media control, Catherine Graham attended, now her son attends, we have, but at the same time the media would say it didn't exist, you're a kook if you talk about it, but year after year you're able to learn what's going to happen in the next year.
[02:13:37.612 --> 02:13:43.895]  I mean, you reported on the fall of the Soviet Union before it happened because of your inside sources in Bilderberg.
[02:13:44.675 --> 02:13:45.136]  I remember
[02:13:46.357 --> 02:13:49.399]  You were on this show back in 2002.
[02:13:49.519 --> 02:13:51.420]  They were saying that they were about to invade Iraq.
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:52.480]  It was a sure thing.
[02:13:52.941 --> 02:13:57.943]  On the nightly news, you said, no, I have it from inside Bilderberg, that they put it off a year.
[02:13:58.304 --> 02:13:59.764]  It's going to be in March of 2003.
[02:14:00.485 --> 02:14:14.453]  I mean, listen, Jim, I mean, you know this better than I do, but for those that don't, you keep getting just the most sterling, spot-on, dead-on intel out of these meetings.
[02:14:14.493 --> 02:14:15.193]  How do you do that?
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:22.965]  Well, you sort of described the techniques before, and human nature seems to always work the same way.
[02:14:23.686 --> 02:14:29.731]  I'll arrive typically on a Monday before the shutdown begins at Heiden on Wednesday.
[02:14:30.172 --> 02:14:33.474]  On the Wednesday, the advance staff of Dillberg starts arriving.
[02:14:34.235 --> 02:14:40.721]  At Heiden on the Wednesday, typically the hotel is cleared of all other guests completely.
[02:14:40.741 --> 02:14:43.003]  So Monday and Tuesday,
[02:14:44.091 --> 02:14:56.337]  I'll be among the strangers mainly in the cocktail lounge or maybe having lunch and express my awe at these important people coming.
[02:14:56.637 --> 02:15:02.921]  I tried to get reservations for the whole week and they said I'd be up by Wednesday so I'm staying at this other hotel.
[02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:07.632]  We're good to go.
[02:15:31.678 --> 02:15:32.699]  We're good to go.
[02:15:54.585 --> 02:15:56.547]  If they put me on the rack, I could not name you.
[02:15:57.068 --> 02:15:58.730]  It was the longest time, though.
[02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:24.099]  I've taken my leave and asked the hotel front desk to call a cab for me, and I'm sitting outside, it's a pleasant evening outside that resort hotel, and one of them's been just waiting for the cab to roll in.
[02:16:25.119 --> 02:16:28.021]  And this guy in plain clothes came over and showed me his identification.
[02:16:28.041 --> 02:16:33.624]  To the side of himself, this is with the Italian police, and, uh, may I see your passport?
[02:16:33.805 --> 02:16:33.965]  Yep.
[02:16:35.045 --> 02:16:42.430]  Uh, I don't have a cab coming, so, uh, he checks the passport, goes inside to make a phone call, comes back out and says, uh,
[02:16:44.208 --> 02:16:46.290]  Would you please come with us?
[02:16:46.370 --> 02:16:48.431]  The commander wants to see you.
[02:16:49.452 --> 02:16:57.179]  Well, it was about a 30 minute drive through a lot of little towns till we got to whatever police headquarters occupied by the commander.
[02:16:57.699 --> 02:17:04.245]  I later learned there was a local cop shop just a block away from the hotel, but it took me on a big long ride.
[02:17:04.265 --> 02:17:06.607]  Tell you what, Jim, we've got to break.
[02:17:06.667 --> 02:17:09.530]  I want to hear the rest of the story when we get back.
[02:17:10.761 --> 02:17:14.362]  After this quick break, and of course, I'm in the Secret Rumors of the World series.
[02:17:14.422 --> 02:17:15.262]  It's aired in the U.S.
[02:17:15.282 --> 02:17:17.563]  and England and Japan with Jim.
[02:17:18.523 --> 02:17:27.325]  But in the segment with Jim, he's over in Europe and there's these guys with dark sunglasses, you know, chasing them around in cars.
[02:17:28.825 --> 02:17:36.467]  But this is par for the course for a major reporter for a major publication just trying to cover what the world's elite are doing.
[02:17:37.358 --> 02:17:38.101]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:38.141 --> 02:17:39.968]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:17:40.008 --> 02:17:40.430]  Stay with us.
[02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:45.830]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:50.692]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:17:50.852 --> 02:17:58.654]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:17:58.914 --> 02:18:04.296]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:04.496 --> 02:18:11.478]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:18:11.778 --> 02:18:17.120]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:18:17.361 --> 02:18:22.123]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:18:22.443 --> 02:18:30.066]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:18:30.386 --> 02:18:35.849]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:18:36.930 --> 02:18:38.133]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.153 --> 02:18:38.374]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:44.898 --> 02:18:53.963]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:18:54.223 --> 02:19:05.450]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:11.493]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:19:11.733 --> 02:19:18.378]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:18.598 --> 02:19:25.443]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:25.703 --> 02:19:27.464]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[02:19:27.724 --> 02:19:29.806]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:19:30.006 --> 02:19:31.707]  Get a 2-pack for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175.
[02:19:31.927 --> 02:19:32.588]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:42.094]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:19:43.855 --> 02:19:46.357]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.097 --> 02:19:49.759]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:20:01.407]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech?
[02:20:02.162 --> 02:20:06.624]  Freedom of religion and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[02:20:07.585 --> 02:20:12.827]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:20:13.628 --> 02:20:21.532]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:42.955 --> 02:20:48.478]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[02:20:48.678 --> 02:20:56.263]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[02:20:56.343 --> 02:21:02.966]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[02:21:03.166 --> 02:21:04.527]  Now it's available to you.
[02:21:04.687 --> 02:21:11.271]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[02:21:11.491 --> 02:21:15.794]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[02:21:16.075 --> 02:21:22.339]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[02:21:22.479 --> 02:21:26.562]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[02:21:35.649 --> 02:21:51.655]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.135 --> 02:21:55.056]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.276 --> 02:22:00.858]  Alright, David and others that are holding, we'll get to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:01.704 --> 02:22:02.845]  You want to join us on air?
[02:22:02.865 --> 02:22:03.665]  Have any questions?
[02:22:04.405 --> 02:22:12.970]  The expert, the clear world expert, the trailblazer who first exposed Bilderberg Group, then you're welcome to join us at 800-259-9231.
[02:22:13.090 --> 02:22:26.377]  And I know Jim will jump in and say, well actually there was one other news reporter decades before that had mentioned it, but he's the guy that has made the term a household name.
[02:22:26.397 --> 02:22:26.457]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:30.806 --> 02:22:33.508]  Your chance to talk to Jim Tucker from American Free Press.
[02:22:34.709 --> 02:22:40.414]  Jim, so they drive you for 30 minutes into a rural area.
[02:22:40.514 --> 02:22:41.355]  What happens next?
[02:22:41.635 --> 02:22:47.040]  It's actually a small town and they wanted to know what my purpose was.
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:49.001]  I said, you know what my purpose is.
[02:22:49.021 --> 02:22:51.303]  It's here to cover Bilderberg.
[02:22:51.323 --> 02:22:53.005]  I will find out what they're doing.
[02:22:53.025 --> 02:22:54.125]  I will report on it.
[02:22:57.216 --> 02:22:58.316]  This goes on for a while.
[02:22:58.756 --> 02:23:00.717]  Uh, let me ask you about my press credentials.
[02:23:01.297 --> 02:23:05.698]  Well, I have the Mickey Mouse press credentials that are issued by the D.C.
[02:23:05.778 --> 02:23:19.361]  Police because 20 years ago, I, uh, stole a, uh, what was that searcher from, uh, Maryland's name, now long out of the Senate, retired, almost dead, Mathias, Charles Mathias.
[02:23:20.122 --> 02:23:25.403]  I stole his Bilderberg portfolio, and, uh, they found out it was me who stole it.
[02:23:26.047 --> 02:23:26.368]  I'm not sure.
[02:23:39.033 --> 02:23:40.935]  And I tell what they call periodicals.
[02:23:40.975 --> 02:23:41.915]  That's magazines.
[02:23:44.017 --> 02:23:45.018]  But what does it matter?
[02:23:45.058 --> 02:23:46.719]  You write for a major newspaper.
[02:23:46.739 --> 02:23:53.124]  I mean, when I was in New York, they'd walk over to me standing in front of Ground Zero interviewing people.
[02:23:53.144 --> 02:23:54.746]  They'd go, let us see your press credentials.
[02:23:54.786 --> 02:23:57.128]  And I'm like, it's called the First Amendment.
[02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.209]  Here's my congressional press pass.
[02:24:00.551 --> 02:24:01.733]  It's pure harassment.
[02:24:02.434 --> 02:24:09.467]  As far as convenience is concerned, you go into a hearing room and you can pick up the text of the testimony.
[02:24:09.948 --> 02:24:11.671]  Sometimes the public at large can't also.
[02:24:11.711 --> 02:24:12.212]  Anybody can.
[02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.731]  I don't think so.
[02:24:33.734 --> 02:24:36.276]  Just to be clear, though, let's get back to the story.
[02:24:36.356 --> 02:24:37.677]  I'm kind of digressing.
[02:24:38.097 --> 02:24:39.618]  They asked to see your press credentials.
[02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:50.685]  So I showed them the Mickey Mouse press credentials, and then they decide they won't bother me anymore, and they drove me back several hours.
[02:24:50.925 --> 02:24:52.667]  As I say, it took about three hours altogether.
[02:24:53.147 --> 02:25:00.752]  They drove me back to my hotel, and I went to the bar where I could see the lobby from a mirror over the bar.
[02:25:01.539 --> 02:25:07.784]  And they sat down and I lived a long time in the lobby.
[02:25:08.504 --> 02:25:12.547]  So I went out and said, fellas, I'm not going anywhere else tonight.
[02:25:12.747 --> 02:25:17.211]  If you want to know any more about Build-A-Burger, I'd be glad to tell you.
[02:25:17.231 --> 02:25:19.973]  They said, oh, we're regulars.
[02:25:20.033 --> 02:25:21.254]  We're here because we want to be.
[02:25:21.274 --> 02:25:21.894]  We're regulars.
[02:25:22.555 --> 02:25:24.957]  The bartender told me they're not regulars.
[02:25:24.997 --> 02:25:26.758]  They very rarely come into this hotel.
[02:25:27.538 --> 02:25:30.841]  So I felt myself under constant observation after that.
[02:25:31.904 --> 02:25:42.774]  Well, he called for a cab to take you to the gate after the lockdown so I could go just for the record, try to walk through and have them bar me just for the record.
[02:25:43.775 --> 02:25:49.860]  And the cab driver said, I can take you over to the gate now because I've got this credential hanging around my neck.
[02:25:50.861 --> 02:25:52.943]  I said, no, I do exactly what they're going to do.
[02:25:53.603 --> 02:25:58.708]  If the cab driver drove me all the way into the grounds, they'd grab me and put me in jail for trespassing.
[02:25:59.441 --> 02:26:03.488]  Well, uh, crossing the police line, uh, and all that jazz.
[02:26:03.909 --> 02:26:07.675]  So, I felt the constant surveillance, but that just made it more interesting.
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.301]  Yeah, talk about adventure.
[02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:16.183]  And again, you're just a member of the press trying to cover a meeting of the rich, powerful, and famous.
[02:26:16.603 --> 02:26:22.266]  The richest people in the world, the heads of industry, banking, heads of state.
[02:26:22.706 --> 02:26:25.127]  And all you're trying to do is go cover it.
[02:26:25.167 --> 02:26:29.629]  I mean, normally the media will cover one or two Hollywood stars.
[02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:45.079]  I've always put this way to the other paper boys at the press club and said the same way for 20 years because it leaves them so flat-footed.
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:53.085]  I tell them if 120 film stars or 120 professional football players have a secret meeting behind locked and closed doors,
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:58.583]  You would, let's say, try very hard to determine what's happening behind those closed doors.
[02:26:59.123 --> 02:27:13.953]  Why no curiosity when 120 of the world's most powerful men, international bankers, international financiers, multinational CEOs of multinational companies, and heads of state and high officials of our government meet?
[02:27:14.593 --> 02:27:15.794]  And no curiosity at all?
[02:27:16.114 --> 02:27:17.455]  They simply cannot answer that question.
[02:27:17.475 --> 02:27:18.756]  There's a sheepish grin.
[02:27:19.116 --> 02:27:22.078]  Others, in fact, have told me, I know we ought to cover it, they just don't let us.
[02:27:22.998 --> 02:27:23.798]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:23.998 --> 02:27:29.300]  Well, we are going to cover it with Jim Tucker, and I've got some other key questions for him after we take some of your calls.
[02:27:29.861 --> 02:27:32.902]  We'll talk about this year's upcoming meeting, what may be on the agenda.
[02:27:35.182 --> 02:27:36.103]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.583 --> 02:27:38.204]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.104 --> 02:27:41.765]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.003 --> 02:27:51.625]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[02:27:51.985 --> 02:28:02.109]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil and particularly the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[02:28:02.769 --> 02:28:04.270]  With a 100% kill.
[02:28:04.731 --> 02:28:09.394]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural urban spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[02:28:14.097 --> 02:28:22.864]  The oils, juices, and capsules manufactured by North American Urban Spice are from the finest raw materials in the world, which is why North American Urban Spice is recognized as the leader in natural herbal products.
[02:28:23.304 --> 02:28:28.147]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.

[02:28:32.089 --> 02:28:33.990]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs.
[02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:34.831]  The choice is yours.
[02:28:34.851 --> 02:28:37.712]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American Herb and Spice products today.
[02:28:44.821 --> 02:28:51.082]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.203 --> 02:28:57.364]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:57.644 --> 02:29:06.026]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.326 --> 02:29:13.392]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:13.653 --> 02:29:18.497]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:18.697 --> 02:29:24.102]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:24.462 --> 02:29:27.505]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:27.865 --> 02:29:35.774]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.854 --> 02:29:36.435]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.206 --> 02:29:48.367]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:29:48.547 --> 02:29:51.248]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:29:51.448 --> 02:29:52.988]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:29:53.008 --> 02:30:02.891]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:30:03.131 --> 02:30:04.872]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[02:30:05.152 --> 02:30:09.035]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:30:09.255 --> 02:30:13.678]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:30:13.878 --> 02:30:17.741]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:24.166]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:30:24.346 --> 02:30:27.148]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:30:27.328 --> 02:30:30.690]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:34.573]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[02:30:34.733 --> 02:30:35.934]  Call toll free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:30:35.954 --> 02:30:36.515]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:30:56.807 --> 02:31:04.909]  Jim could report ten years ago, the things that we're seeing unfold today from the intel he got from inside the Bilderberg Group meetings.
[02:31:06.409 --> 02:31:19.211]  That's because we have the most dominant individuals on the planet Earth meeting together to combine their energies and forces to bring about even greater power and control for their dynasties.
[02:31:20.191 --> 02:31:24.152]  And we're going to go to David and Steve and others for our guest here in a moment.
[02:31:25.337 --> 02:31:27.758]  on this live Wednesday edition.
[02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:36.219]  I just want to briefly remind listeners that my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is now out on DVD.
[02:31:36.239 --> 02:31:37.960]  It's also on VHS.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:45.501]  The DVD is three hours, it's about thirty-something seconds, thirty-five seconds, three hours thirty-five seconds, over three hours.
[02:31:46.142 --> 02:31:51.883]  The VHS is two hours thirty-five minutes long, and it's my best film ever.
[02:31:51.903 --> 02:31:53.003]  We show the police state,
[02:31:53.898 --> 02:31:58.761]  We show the truth about 9-11 and then we expose the power behind the throne.
[02:31:59.181 --> 02:32:00.782]  Who controls the New World Order?
[02:32:00.802 --> 02:32:01.702]  It's my best work.
[02:32:01.742 --> 02:32:03.083]  I hope you'll get it.
[02:32:03.123 --> 02:32:08.685]  It's available via InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[02:32:09.006 --> 02:32:13.548]  You can order hard copies of the films or watch free clips of the videos, read about the different specials.
[02:32:14.270 --> 02:32:17.791]  Or you can call toll-free to get Martial Law or any of my other videos or books.
[02:32:17.811 --> 02:32:18.752]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:18.772 --> 02:32:29.176]  Or last but not least, there's PrisonPlanet.tv where you can watch it online.
[02:32:30.456 --> 02:32:34.498]  Jim Tucker, before we go to these calls, two questions.
[02:32:36.234 --> 02:32:39.296]  Obviously, folks can read your regular columns at American Free Press.
[02:32:39.376 --> 02:32:44.280]  Also, a lot of them, some of the back issues are online at AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:32:45.982 --> 02:32:47.983]  How can folks subscribe to the newspaper?
[02:32:50.045 --> 02:32:52.327]  Well, they can call the newspaper.
[02:32:54.609 --> 02:32:58.872]  I never call myself up, so I have to look for the number myself.
[02:32:58.892 --> 02:32:59.233]  No, I know.
[02:32:59.273 --> 02:33:00.273]  I just sprung that on you.
[02:33:00.293 --> 02:33:02.795]  But people can go to AmericanFreePress.net
[02:33:04.062 --> 02:33:06.745]  And they can find all that information out a little bit later.
[02:33:06.765 --> 02:33:09.087]  We'll give you that number to call.
[02:33:09.768 --> 02:33:12.571]  Because I can hear Jim digging around through stacks of paper.
[02:33:13.031 --> 02:33:15.814]  He sounds like I do when I'm trying to find something.
[02:33:15.834 --> 02:33:17.416]  But it's a really good newspaper.
[02:33:17.856 --> 02:33:20.919]  A populist publication that isn't left or right.
[02:33:20.939 --> 02:33:24.683]  It just exposes the corrupt elite that's running roughshod over us.
[02:33:25.724 --> 02:33:27.066]  Jim, the second question is,
[02:33:28.046 --> 02:33:41.473]  I know you're trying to find the location, you always do, knock on wood, in a hope and pray to be serious that you do get it done this time, but any inkling on what's going to be on the agenda this year?
[02:33:42.293 --> 02:33:45.895]  Now that I've found the telephone number, let me get that out before I forget and lose it again.
[02:33:46.235 --> 02:33:46.455]  Sure.
[02:33:46.615 --> 02:33:47.776]  Call American Free Press at 202-544-5977.
[02:33:53.477 --> 02:34:03.424]  And, uh, you can sign up over the phone to subscribe, or of course you could, uh, uh, uh, write in, but it's easier by telephone.
[02:34:04.184 --> 02:34:08.527]  So, uh... Give that number out one more time.
[02:34:08.567 --> 02:34:08.848]  Uh, 202, uh, 544-5977.
[02:34:21.437 --> 02:34:23.179]  Or AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:35.994]  Now, Jim, shifting over to that last question that I had before we take some calls, then I want to talk about Hearst Publishing and the 9-11 hit piece they've done on myself and your paper and others.
[02:34:36.515 --> 02:34:40.400]  But before we do that, any inkling of what's going to be on the agenda coming up this year?
[02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:51.039]  Well, I'm sure that they'll be considering very hard how they can flip the direct taxation thing through the U.N.
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.583]  There'll be, of course, pressure on the control press to not report it.
[02:34:55.603 --> 02:35:02.250]  In fact, I don't think you've read in the Washington Post or the New York Times that there is a fully
[02:35:03.464 --> 02:35:03.745]  I don't know.
[02:35:20.904 --> 02:35:31.088]  In fact, since the ability to tax directly is such a symbol of global sovereignty, that's very important in their grand schemes of a world government.
[02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:48.094]  As you know, the European Union, the evolving American Union, and the planned Asian-Pacific Union to divide the world into three great regions for the administrative convenience of a world government.
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:56.384]  The dollarization of America, as in the euro in Europe.
[02:35:56.984 --> 02:36:08.150]  Another important symbol of sovereignty, of course, is your own currency, the British Pound, a symbol of British sovereignty, as the dollar is a symbol of American sovereignty, United States sovereignty.
[02:36:09.210 --> 02:36:10.711]  Those are regular items on their issues.
[02:36:10.751 --> 02:36:16.494]  There's always some surprises, and there's always three or four guests who
[02:36:17.236 --> 02:36:18.277]  You cannot anticipate.
[02:36:18.317 --> 02:36:22.641]  I had no idea that Senator John Edwards would be attending the last Bilderberg meeting.
[02:36:22.661 --> 02:36:31.569]  As soon as I found out he was there, I thought that he was considered a potential president.
[02:36:31.709 --> 02:36:38.916]  Now, if he doesn't come back this year, if he's not invited back, they will have decided that he's no longer a potential president.
[02:36:40.501 --> 02:36:51.644]  Well, it's interesting that the New York Times, in one of the two articles they wrote last year about it, said that the Bilderberg Group gave the nod to Kerry and said that they liked Kerry.
[02:36:51.684 --> 02:36:57.065]  Was that disinfo or a fissure between the Anglo-American establishment based in the U.S.
[02:36:57.105 --> 02:37:01.326]  and England and the Bilderberg Group dominated by Europeans?
[02:37:03.406 --> 02:37:08.088]  Yes, there are definitely more Europeans than Americans participating.
[02:37:08.108 --> 02:37:08.868]  That's just based on
[02:37:11.175 --> 02:37:15.958]  The fact that we're one country of several represented in Europe.
[02:37:16.779 --> 02:37:22.943]  In fact, we're probably on a per-country basis, but we have more representatives of Bilderberg than any other one country probably.
[02:37:23.364 --> 02:37:27.627]  I've never thought about it that way before, but we have always had several high officials.
[02:37:27.707 --> 02:37:40.436]  Sometimes the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury has gone in the past, but always very high officials attend these meetings on the promises of absolute silence.
[02:37:41.198 --> 02:38:08.974]  Interesting, you were mentioning when we reported that the invasion of Iraq would not take place in the year 2002, it would be sometime the following year, Jimmy Lee Hoagland, the associate editor of the Marching Post, who holds the publisher's hand at these Bilderberg meetings, he had to know that, but he let his own newspaper go ahead with the predictions that it would happen in the summer, or late fall at the earliest, of 2002, of that year of 2002.
[02:38:11.213 --> 02:38:17.498]  Now, his commitment to secrecy was so strong, he didn't go to the National or World Desks and Look-Fellers.
[02:38:17.939 --> 02:38:23.643]  Trust me, I know we're not going to go to war in 2002, so climb off the predictions that we'll be at war this year.
[02:38:24.163 --> 02:38:26.766]  Okay, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:38:26.866 --> 02:38:27.886]  David in Illinois.
[02:38:27.926 --> 02:38:28.827]  You're on the air, David.
[02:38:29.428 --> 02:38:30.528]  Oh, hello.
[02:38:31.795 --> 02:38:40.938]  In all your meetings with the Bilderbergs, have you ever come across the European Council of Princes, formerly the International Council of Government?
[02:38:42.719 --> 02:38:44.119]  I didn't know such a group existed.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:45.180]  Oh, okay.
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:51.522]  Well, Jim, I think a better question would be, or to clarify it, is there a lot of royalty at these meetings?
[02:38:53.143 --> 02:38:55.163]  Bobby Prince Charles has attended one meeting.
[02:38:58.178 --> 02:39:00.199]  Now, let's be clear.
[02:39:25.496 --> 02:39:28.657]  One of the founders of the Bilderberg Group, it turned out, was an SS officer.
[02:39:30.898 --> 02:39:37.019]  In fact, Prince Bernhardt was supposed to have some Nazi sympathy, as they said.
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.360]  Yeah, he was an SS officer.
[02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:43.661]  And then there's the same connection with the former head of the UN, Kirk Voltheim.
[02:39:43.681 --> 02:39:47.823]  So, the same story over and over again, but it's okay for them to be like that.
[02:39:48.183 --> 02:39:50.824]  It's not okay for anybody else to be like that.
[02:39:50.884 --> 02:39:51.964]  Anything else, David?
[02:39:52.624 --> 02:39:53.225]  No, that's about it.
[02:39:53.485 --> 02:39:53.705]  Thanks.
[02:39:54.105 --> 02:39:54.325]  All right.
[02:39:54.365 --> 02:39:55.326]  Thank you for the call.
[02:39:56.247 --> 02:39:57.928]  Steve in Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:39:57.968 --> 02:39:58.328]  Welcome.
[02:39:58.708 --> 02:39:59.049]  Yes.
[02:39:59.429 --> 02:40:01.150]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:03.832]  And my question is to Jim Tucker.
[02:40:04.492 --> 02:40:06.714]  Thank you for your work you've done over the years, Jim.
[02:40:06.774 --> 02:40:08.836]  I've listened to you off and on for years.
[02:40:09.736 --> 02:40:15.200]  And a couple of years ago, I called into Alex's show and talked with his guest, Al Cuppett.
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:20.924]  And Al said that there were basically three organizations that run the world.
[02:40:21.643 --> 02:40:24.944]  And one of these organizations was the Jesuit.
[02:40:26.145 --> 02:40:42.810]  If you go to the book, Rulers of Evil, by Tupper Saucy, he describes in there where he looked up the word Rothschild in the Encyclopedia Judaica, and it says that they are the keepers of the Vatican treasury.
[02:40:43.871 --> 02:40:48.452]  My question, Jim, is what part does the Vatican play in all of this?
[02:40:51.471 --> 02:41:00.056]  I remember some years ago, some screwball wrote on the internet that Pope John hyphen Paul would be there, along with 300 other people.
[02:41:00.956 --> 02:41:01.437]  He was wrong.
[02:41:01.497 --> 02:41:06.340]  The Pope was back in his native Poland during the Bilderberg meeting, and there's the tradition 100, 15, 120, not the 300 as predicted.
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:07.800]  No official rule that I can determine.
[02:41:13.215 --> 02:41:15.375]  I think a lot of that comes from the Colossae Vatican.
[02:41:16.676 --> 02:41:25.737]  I'm certainly not an expert being a Baptist, but the Colossae Pope has many jewels in his crown, the Vatican has so much money.
[02:41:26.778 --> 02:41:38.420]  Now, the Rothschilds, according to biographers, literally translate from Red Shield in German, back before last names, when last names were first coming in style.
[02:41:39.438 --> 02:41:42.080]  And they had a red shield on the door, so they called themselves Red Shields.
[02:41:42.861 --> 02:41:49.706]  And interesting enough, the Rockefellers from Germany, Rockefeller meant rye fields.
[02:41:50.326 --> 02:41:51.067]  They grew rye.
[02:41:51.767 --> 02:41:52.988]  So they were rye fields.
[02:41:54.810 --> 02:41:58.973]  Now the Rothschilds have been an influence from the outset at Bilderberg.
[02:42:00.494 --> 02:42:06.278]  It used to be that Evan Rothschild attended for Bilderberg meetings.
[02:42:06.318 --> 02:42:08.440]  There's an earlier Bilderberger
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:12.641]  Earlier, Rothschild attended Doberk meetings.
[02:42:13.462 --> 02:42:18.105]  Now, nobody by the name of Rothschild has attended, according to their list anyway.
[02:42:18.325 --> 02:42:20.507]  What people on their board of directors do, Jim?
[02:42:23.009 --> 02:42:34.937]  Yes, you'll find a listing of somebody who represents Rothschild Enterprises or some such venture, so they still have their hand in it.
[02:42:34.977 --> 02:42:38.259]  It's just not so conspicuous by having someone with the name Rothschild.
[02:42:39.156 --> 02:42:41.158]  Marriages and so forth create different last names.
[02:42:41.678 --> 02:42:46.822]  So Jim, you don't see any influence that the Vatican has on world affairs then?
[02:42:47.522 --> 02:42:53.447]  Oh, definitely the Vatican has influence on world affairs, but I'm not sure that Bilderberg is the conduit.
[02:42:55.268 --> 02:42:56.709]  Does that answer your question, Steve?
[02:42:57.049 --> 02:43:01.833]  Well, kind of, but in my research, and Alex, I thank you for waking me up.
[02:43:03.158 --> 02:43:16.044]  It's driven me to research, and I'll tell you what, the more I research, it seems like all roads, or many roads, lead to Rome, and I just found Jim's answer very interesting.
[02:43:16.624 --> 02:43:17.765]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:43:17.805 --> 02:43:31.091]  I mean, I've researched this, and the globalists have infiltrated almost every major organization, and I think to say it's one group or the other running things is really, in the final equation, disinfo.
[02:43:32.108 --> 02:43:46.306]  I mean, you've got evil people who amass their wealth and combine forces with other powerful individuals from different religious groups, you name it, to bring in a world government to directly tax us through the world government they control.
[02:43:46.386 --> 02:43:47.147]  Jim, do you agree with that?
[02:43:47.908 --> 02:43:48.068]  Yes.
[02:43:49.015 --> 02:44:07.547]  I want to stress that the Catholic Church does indeed have an influence on world affairs, as demonstrated dramatically when the Pope went back to his native Poland back during the Cold War years and stood in the middle of the town square in the Soviet tanks rather than run over the Pope, turned around and withdrew from Poland.
[02:44:08.347 --> 02:44:10.549]  And of course the pronouncements on such things as
[02:44:11.721 --> 02:44:12.061]  I don't
[02:44:23.866 --> 02:44:29.210]  Yeah, you never said they didn't have political impact, so I didn't understand that last statement.
[02:44:29.310 --> 02:44:32.973]  I've got a question for you, and then we'll go to a couple other callers for you.
[02:44:33.133 --> 02:44:36.076]  And this is a side issue, but it goes to media control.
[02:44:36.156 --> 02:44:41.920]  I mean, you're the old classic newshound, you know, including the straw hat, Jim.
[02:44:43.321 --> 02:44:50.847]  And Christopher Bolin, one of your colleagues at the American Free Press, exposed that the individual who wrote the popular mechanics hit piece,
[02:44:52.043 --> 02:44:53.364]  who orchestrated it.
[02:44:53.804 --> 02:44:58.768]  Benjamin Chertoff is a close family member of the Homeland Security Director.
[02:44:59.889 --> 02:45:05.292]  Now he's written about the hidden hand of the CIA and 9-11 and Popular Mechanics.
[02:45:05.873 --> 02:45:12.817]  The brutal purge of the staff of Popular Mechanics preceded the publication of last month's scandalous propaganda piece.
[02:45:13.218 --> 02:45:19.222]  So I wanted to talk to you about Hearst Publishing and its history, but before we did that, a little bit more background
[02:45:20.553 --> 02:45:23.614]  On this, this woman, this Ms.
[02:45:23.674 --> 02:45:29.215]  Black that runs it, has been involved in all those different government activities, and her husband ran the U.S.
[02:45:29.255 --> 02:45:31.036]  government agency.
[02:45:31.156 --> 02:45:33.517]  Let me just read this.
[02:45:34.477 --> 02:45:41.959]  The international law firm co-founded, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the international law firm, by Morris Hadley, her husband.
[02:45:43.041 --> 02:45:46.863]  And then it goes into Skull and Bones members being connected to it.
[02:45:47.543 --> 02:45:58.127]  The article goes into how her husband directed the federal agency that oversees domestic and international propaganda.
[02:45:58.827 --> 02:46:07.511]  Comments on Hirsch Publishing and how it ties into all the fake newscasts and all the paid-off reporters that we've been hearing about.
[02:46:08.791 --> 02:46:21.757]  Well, I'm not sure what daily newspapers are within that chain, but as far as Bilderberg is concerned, they would be part of the conspiracy of silence that we see in the United States.
[02:46:21.797 --> 02:46:34.322]  Now, in Europe, there's a great deal of coverage in the mainstream media, page one stories, photographs about Bilderberg all the time because, well, it all started ten years ago when
[02:46:35.226 --> 02:46:52.077]  Spotlight identified for the Dilbert people going to be very early so early that the Subscribers in Europe had time to wait for the ship to cross the river then they vote letters back to us They should we alert the local media and I said all means tell the local media all about it.
[02:46:52.317 --> 02:47:00.142]  I should have called that years ago now when we find out where they are of course it goes instantly on the website and instantly into the newspaper and
[02:47:01.316 --> 02:47:11.658]  We do write to the subscribers that live nearby and ask them to give them itinerary, tell the reporters, and so forth.
[02:47:11.798 --> 02:47:18.520]  And we've had a large number of reporters come out to cover Bilderberg meetings in Europe, but not in the United States.
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:19.780]  Now let me cover this.
[02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:27.362]  It is often said that USA Today is controlled by the CIA, which, like the paper, is based in McLean, Virginia.
[02:47:27.422 --> 02:47:28.782]  Little known fact that black
[02:47:29.322 --> 02:47:32.903]  Is married to Thomas E. Harvey, Black's the head of hers publishing.
[02:47:33.343 --> 02:47:40.066]  An obscure lawyer who became a White House fellow in 77 and served as special assistant to director of Central Intelligence.
[02:47:40.546 --> 02:47:42.026]  Provides substance to these rumors.
[02:47:42.086 --> 02:47:44.507]  Black's corporate biography does not mention her husband.
[02:47:45.134 --> 02:48:03.105]  And then it goes on to say that he was a senior fellow at the Department of Defense and he was the head, I'm trying to find the subsection of the article here, he was the head of the federal body that deals with propaganda.
[02:48:03.686 --> 02:48:05.627]  And I mean, my only point is, you know, it's
[02:48:06.664 --> 02:48:08.085]  I'm asking you this question, Jim.
[02:48:08.526 --> 02:48:15.992]  So much has come out now about Armstrong Williams and paid-off reporters and hundreds of millions of dollars in fake, federally-funded newscasts.
[02:48:16.793 --> 02:48:20.676]  I want to get your comment just on the general nature of the controlled press.
[02:48:21.157 --> 02:48:25.841]  Not just a conspiracy of silence, but many of them being actual government agents.
[02:48:26.822 --> 02:48:32.367]  We'll be right back after this quick break with Jim Tucker, and perhaps take a few more of your calls.
[02:48:33.067 --> 02:48:33.568]  Stay with us.
[02:48:44.986 --> 02:48:49.330]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:53.934]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.074 --> 02:48:58.457]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:58.497 --> 02:48:59.839]  The New World Order.

[02:49:01.639 --> 02:49:05.860]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:49:25.845 --> 02:49:28.746]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind you,
[02:49:28.806 --> 02:49:30.068]  This is a two and a half hour video.

[02:51:45.314 --> 02:51:50.858]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.606 --> 02:51:58.007]  The head of the Hearst Corporation, Ms.
[02:51:59.908 --> 02:52:04.370]  Black, was named one of the most powerful women in American business.
[02:52:04.570 --> 02:52:09.452]  She sits on the boards of Hearst Corporation, the Advertising Council, IBM, Coca-Cola.
[02:52:09.892 --> 02:52:12.353]  She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:52:13.133 --> 02:52:17.755]  And then it goes on to talk about her husband, Assistant to Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:52:19.386 --> 02:52:24.910]  And it says, in the 1980s, her husband Harvey served as General Counsel and Congressional Liaison of the U.S.
[02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:28.693]  Information Agency, the former external propaganda arm of the U.S.
[02:52:28.733 --> 02:52:29.093]  government.
[02:52:29.794 --> 02:52:36.799]  He also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army and Navy, and was a personal director of the Bush-Quell-92 campaign.
[02:52:37.599 --> 02:52:44.945]  And then it goes on and on, again, Ben Chertoff, cousins with the Homeland Security Director, savagely attacking myself,
[02:52:45.643 --> 02:52:47.365]  American Free Press and others.
[02:52:47.926 --> 02:52:56.737]  Does it surprise you to have people like this attacking institutions like American Free Press and of course myself, Jim?
[02:52:58.656 --> 02:52:59.876]  No, I'm quite used to it.
[02:53:00.757 --> 02:53:11.622]  However, any journalist, as you mentioned earlier, I spent 20 and a half years with major newspapers in this country, establishment journalists, before starting Chase Bilderberg.
[02:53:12.162 --> 02:53:15.823]  And you're a journalistic whore if you take money to pimp somebody's idea.
[02:53:17.264 --> 02:53:22.667]  The proper answer when the government says, or an association or organization says, would
[02:53:24.366 --> 02:53:25.387]  I don't think so.
[02:53:47.694 --> 02:53:49.155]  And now it's just rampant.
[02:53:49.195 --> 02:53:54.078]  I mean, it's been going on for a long time, but now they're just coming out with it and saying, hey, it's no big deal.
[02:53:54.138 --> 02:53:54.819]  This is good.
[02:53:54.839 --> 02:53:56.660]  Oh, they try to rationalize it.
[02:53:56.680 --> 02:53:59.282]  Like this guy says, I'm not a journalist.
[02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:00.242]  I'm a columnist.
[02:54:00.522 --> 02:54:03.544]  I forgot which one that was.
[02:54:03.945 --> 02:54:04.905]  Armstrong Williams.
[02:54:04.925 --> 02:54:05.966]  Yeah, Armstrong Williams.
[02:54:07.547 --> 02:54:10.549]  And one of the other girls said, I really should have mentioned it.
[02:54:10.569 --> 02:54:11.469]  I wish I had mentioned it.
[02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:13.771]  Well, she shouldn't do it at all.
[02:54:14.730 --> 02:54:19.036]  Well, it's a lot bigger than what the people know, and Jim Tucker here in closing
[02:54:29.153 --> 02:54:31.114]  No, I think when middle America finally wakes up.
[02:54:49.494 --> 02:54:50.475]  I don't think so.
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:10.284]  Does not favor ratifying the European Constitution.
[02:55:10.544 --> 02:55:12.265]  The same thing with England?
[02:55:12.406 --> 02:55:32.784]  Yes, in fact that's why we wrote years ago that Bilderberg was determined to ask Lady Thatcher, well she's Prime Minister Thatcher then, as head of state, because she resisted the Euro and resisted surrendering sovereignty to the European Union and so they replaced her with a trapeze artist named John Major from her own party.
[02:55:34.479 --> 02:55:50.460]  I think I mentioned on your last show I had the pleasure of speaking briefly with Lady Thatcher at a reception in Washington and I asked her about it and she said, and this is a very close paraphrase of what she said, that she said, being denounced by Bilderberg, she considered it to be a tribute
[02:55:51.064 --> 02:55:54.325]  Well, Jim Tucker, a good old fashioned muckraker, a real journalist.
[02:56:11.207 --> 02:56:12.428]  Spent the last hour with us.
[02:56:12.548 --> 02:56:14.589]  Alright, wide open phones in the third hour.
[02:56:15.069 --> 02:56:15.910]  A ton of news.
[02:56:16.450 --> 02:56:17.971]  We can talk about the Shivo case.
[02:56:18.011 --> 02:56:19.392]  We can talk about the earthquakes.
[02:56:19.432 --> 02:56:21.813]  We can talk about all these new gun bills.
[02:56:21.833 --> 02:56:25.375]  We can talk about Kofi Annan being cleared by his own agency.
[02:56:25.415 --> 02:56:28.777]  We'll talk about it all in the third hour.
[02:56:29.458 --> 02:56:31.679]  And my new film, Martial Law, is now on DVD.
