[00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:06.586]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:08.327]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.027 --> 00:00:10.148]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.610]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.231]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:22.238]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:23.659]  Music
[00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.246]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:42.892]  Another live edition, and I'm that out-of-control, loudmouth who loves freedom.
[00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:47.576]  Alex Jones, your host, will have wide-open phones yet again today.
[00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.118]  So many things are changing.
[00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:53.081]  The world is moving faster than ever.
[00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:57.665]  And our lives will be over in the twinkling of an eye.
[00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.026]  It's so fleeting.
[00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:02.794]  So why not stand up for what is good and decent?
[00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:10.840]  Why not stand up against the New World Order and stand up for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren's future?
[00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:13.963]  Hey, a new twist.
[00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:24.471]  They want Arnold Schwarzenegger for president, but he's from Austria, so it can't happen unless they change Article 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution.
[00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:27.994]  But now Mel Gibson pushed for president.
[00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:39.173]  And contrary to popular belief, Mel Gibson was born in New York, upstate New York, and didn't move to Australia until he was a teenager.
[00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:42.716]  And yeah, I think Mel Gibson would make a great president.
[00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.198]  He could probably win, too.
[00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.780]  He's one of the most popular actors in Hollywood.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.983]  I don't think he's ever had a failed movie for a Schwarzenegger.
[00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:55.827]  I think quite a few of his last movies have failed, but that isn't why I like Mel Gibson.
[00:01:56.497 --> 00:02:00.359]  I like Mel Gibson because, well, he knows about the New World Order.
[00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.042]  He speaks up for right to life, not just with abortion, but in the Terry Chavo Schindler case.
[00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:13.705]  And he is fully aware of the globalist crime cartels and has talked about it many, many times.
[00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:22.347]  Mel Gibson, push for president, activist inspired by actor Stan Onshivo, says his charisma needed.
[00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:24.227]  Of course, don't hold your breath.
[00:02:24.307 --> 00:02:26.968]  I've never heard that Mel Gibson would want to be president.
[00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:36.310]  Arnold constantly runs around talking about how he wants to be president, but Mel Gibson's a pretty meek, humble person.
[00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:44.265]  Mel Gibson is perhaps one of the few men in America who has shown exceptional courage in facing up to the left and the culture of death.
[00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.546]  James Welsh told World Now Daily.
[00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:52.607]  And we'll tell you about this article a little bit later in the show.
[00:02:52.627 --> 00:02:56.449]  Yeah, and I also heard Gibson once on Sean Hannity's show.
[00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.970]  Sean Hannity groveling at his feet.
[00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.371]  And Mel just came right out and said, yeah, this war is a complete fraud.
[00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:14.561]  And it was like on that Dateline NBC when he said, you know, I know where to hide when this film comes out, where nobody will find me.
[00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.983]  I'm going to hide where the weapons of mass destruction are at.
[00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:26.087]  And that, if you remember, was when they were still looking for them and were saying they were going to find them.
[00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:29.769]  He kind of went out on a limb, but he wasn't going out on a limb and said that they...
[00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:31.888]  So they wouldn't find him.
[00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:41.054]  He was going to hide out when the passion came out because of all the threats where the weapons of mass destruction were so he wouldn't get found.
[00:03:41.474 --> 00:03:42.055]  It's pretty funny.
[00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:46.678]  Minutemen catch 141 illegals so far.
[00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:55.564]  And we had one of their spokesmen on, well, their head coordinator on yesterday to give us an update.
[00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:00.007]  The Mexican troops are right across the border in Arizona.
[00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:14.556]  Where thousands of illegals are stacking up a day, the Mexican troops are giving them food and water and trying to move them by truck to other staging areas to outflank the thousand-plus Minutemen.
[00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:21.782]  Now a New Mexico official hopes to expand Citizen Volunteer Project to Second State.
[00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:25.166]  That's exactly what I was talking about yesterday.
[00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:26.307]  Great news!
[00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.040]  Bad news for Lord Bush.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.120]  Gallup poll.
[00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.343]  Bush approval rating lowest ever for second term president at this point.
[00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:35.863]  Be afraid.
[00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:36.824]  Be very afraid.
[00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:40.146]  There might have to be an event so Bush can be our savior.
[00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:45.808]  Something bad might happen so he can save us and we can learn to love him properly.
[00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:49.190]  There is so much news coming up.
[00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.351]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.872]  1-800-259-9231 That's all for now.
[00:04:52.932 --> 00:04:53.492]  Remember to join us
[00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.974]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:05.919]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.523]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:15.047]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:16.429]  The New World Order.
[00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:22.455]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:29.463]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:31.586]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:42.372]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:47.935]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:51.097]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:06:01.082 --> 00:06:09.684]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:21.187]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:24.068]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:28.489]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.850]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.892]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:39.095]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.355 --> 00:06:45.019]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:50.726]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:07.448]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:08.670]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.671]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.633]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:12.814 --> 00:07:17.678]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:19.020]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.083]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:26.167]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:26.487]  Look.
[00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:28.890]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.136]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:37.280]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.806]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:07:42.906 --> 00:07:43.667]  Try Nobio.
[00:07:43.787 --> 00:07:44.769]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.812]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goal's a long way.
[00:07:49.013 --> 00:07:51.875]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:54.557]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:57.980]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.782]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:03.885]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.485 --> 00:08:07.288]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:30.358]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:33.199]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:50.571]  And for those that are just joining us for the first time out there driving along in your car in Kansas City or Austin, Texas or Pensacola, Florida or out in Los Angeles, California, you're listening for the first time, well, this guy isn't saying he's liberal, he's not saying he's conservative.
[00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.171]  What is he?
[00:08:52.592 --> 00:09:01.578]  Well, labels have been so raped and so twisted in past years that I don't even like using them.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.662]  Sometimes I have to use them with new audiences just so I can even communicate with them.
[00:09:07.182 --> 00:09:12.324]  But the language has been so mongrelized that it means nothing.
[00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:18.947]  A conservative of today is a cross between a communist and a fascist.
[00:09:20.608 --> 00:09:29.592]  And a liberal of today is some type of bleeding heart space cadet who doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[00:09:31.913 --> 00:09:32.053]  And
[00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:42.210]  Quite frankly, it's hard to get people past what I call the fake left-right paradigm.
[00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:51.316]  It's hard to explain to people that the phony left and right have these debates, have these arguments, but that's only on the surface.
[00:09:51.436 --> 00:09:54.938]  Beneath the surface, they're bought and paid for by the same people.
[00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:57.340]  There is a world government.
[00:09:58.441 --> 00:09:59.722]  It is coming down on us.
[00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:01.543]  Freedoms are...
[00:10:03.317 --> 00:10:05.098]  Disappearing all around us.
[00:10:06.558 --> 00:10:09.199]  The public schools are being turned into prisons.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.741]  The whole society is being turned into a prison.
[00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:21.304]  I mean, I've got an article here today where a stupid youth at a high school, a 16-year-old, set off a smoke bomb.
[00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:26.186]  You know, the little cheap smoke bombs that you buy for five bucks.
[00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:28.908]  The whole package of like 20 on the side of the road.
[00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:32.269]  He's been charged as a terrorist.
[00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:34.912]  Under the USA Patriot Act.
[00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:38.354]  Now, I never set off smoke bombs at school.
[00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:41.595]  I never set off cherry bombs in the toilets.
[00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:43.876]  But I know people who did.
[00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:52.280]  And I did a few things, I don't want to say similar, but close enough.
[00:10:53.621 --> 00:11:01.985]  Not at school, but practical jokes, other things, that I guess today could be considered
[00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:03.719]  Terrorism.
[00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:07.462]  Let's just put it to you this way.
[00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:15.569]  I've been riding around with friends in a pickup truck when I was about 14 when they tied a chain to a stop sign and jerked it out of the ground.
[00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:17.150]  You know, stuff like that.
[00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:23.616]  And I think most of you listening once or twice at least got in one of those positions.
[00:11:23.676 --> 00:11:29.021]  Now there were youth out there that did that type of stuff continually and it is a problem.
[00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:31.102]  And they should get in trouble for it.
[00:11:31.182 --> 00:11:38.085]  But most of you out there once or twice got caught up with people, and you know you did, when they were doing stuff like that.
[00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:41.346]  And the question is, do you need to be charged as a terrorist?
[00:11:43.107 --> 00:11:53.932]  I remember in high school once, somebody in the lab, because this experiment was in the book, put some kind of chemical in with another chemical that caused...
[00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:57.906]  A bunch of foam to start shooting out all over the place.
[00:11:58.707 --> 00:11:59.847]  Nobody got in trouble.
[00:12:00.768 --> 00:12:02.028]  This is what young people do.
[00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:09.992]  If it's not intentionally violent or done with criminal intent, you just get suspended for a few days.
[00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:15.235]  Back in my day, which wasn't that long ago, you got paddled by the principal.
[00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:21.898]  And believe me, you didn't want to get in trouble anymore for a few months until the memory of that paddling wore off.
[00:12:23.416 --> 00:12:37.939]  The point I'm trying to make is the government is engaging in maximum throw-the-book-at-you enforcement of the most petty of pranks, in many cases even free speech.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.500]  A young man writing an article about zombies attacking a fictitious high school.
[00:12:44.121 --> 00:12:45.701]  It's charged as a terrorist.
[00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:50.062]  A woman selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes as Homeland Security visitor.
[00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:52.594]  You know the drill.
[00:12:52.954 --> 00:12:54.155]  Many of you are aware of this.
[00:12:54.255 --> 00:13:11.970]  Meanwhile, a thousand men and women show up on the southern border in Arizona to simply sit there with walkie-talkies and cell phones and call the police when Mexican troops come across the border or when Mexicans by the thousands every day pour across.
[00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:14.630]  And George Bush calls them vigilantes.
[00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:34.606]  Meanwhile, Bush is out telling us to tattle on our neighbors, to, quote, fight terrorism, and then the terrorist manuals that they hand out to truck drivers and citizens and many others as part of the TIPS program that got exposed, so they renamed it, but it's being expanded, like programs like Eagle Eyes and others.
[00:13:36.368 --> 00:13:39.791]  In the handbook, it says, there are a man and woman arguing on the street corner.
[00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:41.459]  Call the police.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.200]  Oh yeah, that's terrorism.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.902]  No, that's to boost the city's numbers.
[00:13:47.482 --> 00:14:04.569]  They have to arrest a certain amount of men and women for domestic violence, even if there's no physicality or physical activity involved, because the federal government says arrest X number if you want these bonus federal funds.
[00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:06.526]  But again, I digress.
[00:14:06.586 --> 00:14:10.989]  The point is, there's stuff like, is someone walking down the side of the road with a backpack?
[00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:12.730]  Call the police on them.
[00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:18.593]  Did you see someone smoking a cigarette that didn't look like tobacco?
[00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:20.374]  Call the police on them.
[00:14:20.654 --> 00:14:22.656]  This is in the anti-terror manuals.
[00:14:23.136 --> 00:14:26.178]  Men and women arguing, people with backpacks, marijuana.
[00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:29.119]  Tattle on your neighbors.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.120]  Be a spy.
[00:14:31.761 --> 00:14:32.982]  Unless it's on the borders.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.181]  Where we have a real threat.
[00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:36.882]  Then how dare you?
[00:14:37.703 --> 00:14:38.943]  You report things.
[00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:39.964]  You're bad.
[00:14:39.984 --> 00:14:49.450]  The toll-free number to join us on air today and talk about any issue you want to discuss is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:59.617]  Some good news, they've tried to pass national ID cards, what, four separate times in the last four years in England, and it has failed again.
[00:15:01.249 --> 00:15:03.970]  The problem with the British government is they were honest.
[00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:10.592]  They said, we're going to have federally standardized ID cards that you're going to have to have when you leave your house.
[00:15:13.052 --> 00:15:18.474]  Over here in America, they just go, oh, we're going to have federally standardized driver's licenses.
[00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:20.334]  By the way, you've got to have them to have a job.
[00:15:20.814 --> 00:15:22.795]  By the way, they're part of a Pan-American union.
[00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:27.436]  By the way, you've got to produce these when you're walking down the street or you'll be arrested.
[00:15:28.116 --> 00:15:30.437]  But since they don't call it an ID card...
[00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:32.389]  An actual ID card.
[00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.310]  We go, oh, yes, give it to us.
[00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:44.858]  Then it actually gave amnesty to the illegal aliens in the bill, but Rush Limbaugh told you it fought illegal aliens, so you believed it, even though the actual bill says the opposite.
[00:15:44.898 --> 00:15:47.860]  We've had Ron Paul and others on exposing it as a fraud.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:56.566]  But the good news is, in England at least, where the government, I guess, wasn't sophisticated enough to lie about it, they've failed again.
[00:15:58.547 --> 00:16:00.708]  Interesting article talking about the Second Amendment.
[00:16:01.109 --> 00:16:02.870]  They did a big Zogby poll.
[00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:15.257]  The Second Amendment Foundation paid to have a big Zogby poll done of 1,009 likely voters chosen at random nationwide with a margin of error plus or minus 3.2%.
[00:16:15.297 --> 00:16:18.298]  And this poll was just done March 30th to April 1st.
[00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.899]  And out of 1,009 people they questioned...
[00:16:26.912 --> 00:16:34.354]  Only five respondents supported the notion of gun control associated with the fight against terrorism.
[00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.155]  Five people out of 1,009.
[00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:48.938]  And for those that don't know about this, about a month ago, Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI, got up in front of Congress and said,
[00:16:50.846 --> 00:16:59.888]  We need to create huge gun databases of people that even have misdemeanors, anybody who's on a criminal or terror watch list, anybody who's ever, quote, had a mental problem.
[00:17:00.428 --> 00:17:01.488]  They can't own a gun.
[00:17:01.528 --> 00:17:04.529]  We need to register all gun owners basically through the NICS program.
[00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:09.610]  And the Democrats started hopping around going, yes, yes, yes.
[00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:16.231]  Alberto Gonzalez, the new Attorney General, who says he's for gun control, he believes in it in his heart.
[00:17:16.877 --> 00:17:21.141]  He wants to reauthorize the assault weapons ban and do a bunch of other really bad things.
[00:17:22.362 --> 00:17:24.804]  They're out there pushing this legislation.
[00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:28.587]  They're pushing this legislation right now.
[00:17:29.988 --> 00:17:32.910]  And you will not hear the mainstream neocons talk about it.
[00:17:34.372 --> 00:17:36.473]  You will not hear the phony conservatives talk about it.
[00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:38.055]  They are there to keep you in the dark.
[00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:39.636]  They are there to lie to you.
[00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:43.199]  They are there to manipulate you to make sure the New World Order succeeds.
[00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:45.560]  But look at Bush's appointees.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.620]  Look at all of them.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:52.543]  I mean, it is just bedlam, a wild orgy of gun control.
[00:17:54.064 --> 00:17:57.106]  Pataki opens the door in New York to sue gun manufacturers.
[00:17:57.546 --> 00:18:02.969]  If they start winning those suits now in New York, we'll lose most of our manufacturers.
[00:18:04.449 --> 00:18:11.673]  Bush has got his zero-tolerance federal prosecution, where you've got a gun stored wrong, or just...
[00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.592]  A state law that you weren't supposed to have a clip that could hold over ten rounds?
[00:18:21.013 --> 00:18:23.394]  They will come in and federally prosecute you.
[00:18:24.955 --> 00:18:28.336]  And you tell this to the average gun owner, they don't even know what's happening.
[00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:31.318]  Because the NRA will not tell them.
[00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:34.940]  Because they're a loyal opposition group, totally controlled.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.722]  For those who don't believe me, last year they went into federal court and argued that all guns should be registered.
[00:18:41.343 --> 00:18:44.004]  I read their actual filing on air.
[00:18:45.487 --> 00:18:55.894]  I mean, if you want to keep the Second Amendment, we've got the power to do it, but you've got to stop being manipulated by these Trojan horses, by these Judas Iscariots, by these manipulators.
[00:18:57.455 --> 00:18:59.496]  But anyways, there's the poll.
[00:19:00.016 --> 00:19:13.725]  Out of over a thousand people randomly polled by Zogby, the most respected polling agency in the country, only five people were for these different types of gun bans.
[00:19:14.637 --> 00:19:18.581]  That are being pushed under the name of Fighting Al-Ciata.
[00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:21.184]  Amazing.
[00:19:21.204 --> 00:19:27.470]  Alright, we'll come back and talk to Alan and Gary and Tim and Gil and others that are patiently holding.
[00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.671]  Then I'm going to get to another poll.
[00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:29.752]  Gallup poll.
[00:19:29.812 --> 00:19:33.135]  Bush approval rating lowest ever for second term president.
[00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:37.740]  I'll get into more details of school prankster arrested under Patriot Act.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.941]  Ridiculous.
[00:19:40.086 --> 00:19:45.349]  Experts offer yet another contradictory conclusion for why the World Trade Center's collapsed.
[00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.031]  Contradicting their last two phony headlines.
[00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:53.514]  The Des Moines Register headline, Gannon, is he Johnny Gosch?
[00:19:54.674 --> 00:19:56.555]  And Mel Gibson pushed for president.
[00:19:57.316 --> 00:19:59.037]  That's only some of what's coming up.
[00:19:59.537 --> 00:20:00.057]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:04.906]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.346 --> 00:20:09.689]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:20:09.969 --> 00:20:15.772]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:20.054]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:20:20.355 --> 00:20:25.277]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:20:25.297 --> 00:20:26.498]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.340]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.580]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:31.841]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.323 --> 00:21:02.124]  Terrorism.
[00:21:02.244 --> 00:21:03.004]  Terrorism.
[00:21:03.104 --> 00:21:03.945]  Chemical attacks.
[00:21:04.005 --> 00:21:04.685]  Dirty bombs.
[00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:05.186]  Fallout.
[00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:06.247]  Biological attack.
[00:21:06.447 --> 00:21:06.987]  Anthrax.
[00:21:07.047 --> 00:21:09.169]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:21:09.429 --> 00:21:11.010]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.752]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:28.702]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:28.742 --> 00:21:29.043]  government.
[00:21:29.223 --> 00:21:30.964]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:21:31.404 --> 00:21:37.308]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:37.448 --> 00:21:41.951]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:21:42.192 --> 00:21:49.297]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.618]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:11.347]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:12.448 --> 00:22:22.117]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:29.604]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:22:30.569 --> 00:22:39.411]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.

[00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:41.852]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:41.872 --> 00:22:42.232]  Call now.
[00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:47.594]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:04.328]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:23:04.588 --> 00:23:05.749]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:10.773]  I was having a hard time breathing and I had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:23:10.873 --> 00:23:14.416]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.438]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.499]  Cardivite.
[00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.100]  We'll use Cardivite!
[00:23:19.953 --> 00:23:23.418]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[00:23:35.054 --> 00:23:35.294]  Or call 1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:35.554]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:14.105]  Let's do this.
[00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:18.286]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls and then I'll get into all this other news.
[00:24:18.526 --> 00:24:20.567]  Minutemen catch 141 illegals.
[00:24:21.067 --> 00:24:27.168]  So far, New Mexico official hopes to expand Citizen Volunteer Project to the second state.
[00:24:27.868 --> 00:24:29.888]  People are tired of the feds doing nothing.
[00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:32.229]  They're taking action and I salute them.
[00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:34.312]  Alan in Connecticut.
[00:24:34.412 --> 00:24:35.033]  Alan, welcome.
[00:24:35.053 --> 00:24:37.975]  It's a real honor to talk to you, sir.
[00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:39.296]  Honor to talk to you, Alan.
[00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:39.676]  Welcome.
[00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:43.699]  I was first introduced to you through the George Norrie program.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:44.600]  Yes.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.763]  And I just got your new movie yesterday in the mail.
[00:24:48.823 --> 00:24:50.184]  I've already watched it three times.
[00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.266]  Well, then that means you spent nine hours.
[00:24:54.047 --> 00:24:54.527]  That's right.
[00:24:54.807 --> 00:24:59.511]  I mean, I'm still... I have a couple questions for you I'd like to ask you.
[00:24:59.611 --> 00:24:59.711]  Uh...
[00:25:02.148 --> 00:25:15.251]  First of all, because of the George Norrie program, I was wondering if you, A, believe them, and B, I'd like to know how the story of UFOs kind of fit into this government conspiracy cover-up.
[00:25:16.051 --> 00:25:24.873]  And two, all empires in the past have studied history, have eventually collapsed, and they've failed.
[00:25:25.413 --> 00:25:31.814]  And you see that if, let's say, suppose the globalists are able to become successful in the future,
[00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:36.388]  Don't you think there would be a huge power struggle that would just end up collapsing?
[00:25:38.189 --> 00:25:39.329]  Really good points, Alan.
[00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:40.009]  Thanks for the call.
[00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:41.930]  Let me try to answer both those questions.
[00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:51.112]  There are 200 billion galaxies that the Hubble Space Telescope has taken photographs of.
[00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:56.674]  I mean, there are as many galaxies as, you know, when you go to the beach and the sand
[00:25:58.732 --> 00:25:59.952]  As far as the eye can see.
[00:26:00.012 --> 00:26:02.213]  I mean, each grain of sand being a galaxy.
[00:26:02.893 --> 00:26:09.915]  A galaxy has hundreds of billions, in some cases, in smaller galaxies, hundreds of millions of stars.
[00:26:10.795 --> 00:26:14.596]  Each star is a solar system with planets orbiting it.
[00:26:17.197 --> 00:26:18.717]  I kind of went from the top down.
[00:26:19.037 --> 00:26:20.117]  Let's go from the bottom up.
[00:26:20.157 --> 00:26:22.218]  You've got planets, planetoids.
[00:26:22.778 --> 00:26:27.019]  They're orbited by their satellites, their moons, or other space junk.
[00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:39.458]  And asteroid fields that orbit stars, and then stars are in their own super orbits along denser masses of stars towards the galaxy centers.
[00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:48.825]  And then you have whole clusters of galaxies, like stars, orbiting around each other into super clusters of galaxies.
[00:26:50.646 --> 00:26:53.068]  So, I mean, is there other life in the universe?
[00:26:53.268 --> 00:26:54.869]  It'd be pretty stupid to say there isn't.
[00:26:56.877 --> 00:27:00.279]  There's also, though, incredible distances we're talking about.
[00:27:00.999 --> 00:27:07.362]  Even at light speed, hundreds of years, I don't know, 50 years, you get to the nearest star.
[00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:09.303]  That's not right.
[00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:10.384]  Let's be technical.
[00:27:10.684 --> 00:27:13.105]  25 years to the nearest star for 24 years.
[00:27:14.186 --> 00:27:17.548]  The thousands of years to many of the closer stars.
[00:27:18.408 --> 00:27:21.870]  We're two-thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:29.531]  And quite frankly, I just don't cover UFOs and aliens and men from Mars.
[00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:31.291]  It's very interesting.
[00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:32.152]  It's intriguing.
[00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:33.052]  It's entertaining.
[00:27:33.072 --> 00:27:35.572]  There's a lot of weird stuff under the sun.
[00:27:36.612 --> 00:27:40.593]  And George Norrie probably spends about a third of his time now on UFOs.
[00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.594]  I like the new direction he's taking his broadcast.
[00:27:44.274 --> 00:27:51.535]  Whereas Art Bell, a great broadcaster, spends about 80% of his time on UFOs, George Norrie spends about
[00:27:52.825 --> 00:27:53.165]  A real gentleman.
[00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:53.526]  Very nice.
[00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:54.726]  Very humble.
[00:28:23.397 --> 00:28:30.882]  Look, they've got tens of millions of listeners an hour, and I'm just glad to be able to go on.
[00:28:33.003 --> 00:28:35.605]  He's got a lot of courage, and I know he's taking heat for it.
[00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:39.268]  But that's also where the ratings are.
[00:28:39.328 --> 00:28:47.994]  Look, they know that I've always been blessed because I just tell the truth, and people want the truth, and that gets ratings.
[00:28:48.474 --> 00:28:49.415]  The truth sells.
[00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.376]  The globalists know that.
[00:28:52.205 --> 00:28:54.607]  And they're panicking because they're losing control.
[00:28:55.147 --> 00:28:56.569]  People are demanding the truth.
[00:28:57.689 --> 00:29:05.055]  And so, again, the people want it, the people are going to get it.
[00:29:07.077 --> 00:29:09.579]  I mean, look at these blogs and alternative websites.
[00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:11.040]  They're taking over.
[00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:21.288]  To the point of where now, well, in San Francisco, they're trying to pass a law to regulate
[00:29:22.182 --> 00:29:25.885]  Political or even political commentary or news websites.
[00:29:25.945 --> 00:29:27.006]  Oh, you can't have those.
[00:29:27.026 --> 00:29:28.007]  We're going to audit you.
[00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:29.628]  We're going to check what you're doing.
[00:29:29.648 --> 00:29:32.791]  I mean, that's because they're losing control.
[00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:34.772]  It's a new renaissance.
[00:29:36.173 --> 00:29:40.156]  All right, I just spent five minutes on that one call, but both questions were important.
[00:29:40.837 --> 00:29:45.581]  But no, I don't get into UFOs because I can't prove it one way or the other.
[00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:48.043]  I talk about the stuff I can totally document.
[00:29:48.063 --> 00:29:49.544]  More of your calls coming up.
[00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:52.927]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.387 --> 00:29:55.068]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.108 --> 00:29:58.690]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:05.594]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:30:05.854 --> 00:30:10.156]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:17.320]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:24.370]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:28.156]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:28.276 --> 00:30:29.097]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:33.243 --> 00:30:40.386]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:40.466 --> 00:30:47.169]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:30:47.369 --> 00:30:52.032]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:52.232 --> 00:30:54.753]  That's D-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:30:54.913 --> 00:30:59.575]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:03.543]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.623 --> 00:31:14.328]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:19.230]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:30.635]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:31.675]  We're good to go.
[00:31:53.183 --> 00:31:53.443]  803-4438.
[00:31:53.503 --> 00:31:56.925]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:57.145 --> 00:32:00.007]  That's toll free.
[00:32:00.027 --> 00:32:00.727]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.787 --> 00:32:09.712]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:32:10.112 --> 00:32:11.413]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:32:11.573 --> 00:32:12.253]  Now check this out.
[00:32:12.614 --> 00:32:16.015]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:18.497]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:21.680]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.701]  Your health suffers.
[00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:23.562]  It's that simple.
[00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:27.887]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[00:32:28.327 --> 00:32:36.256]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[00:32:36.696 --> 00:32:40.798]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[00:32:41.138 --> 00:32:43.160]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.560]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.301]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:32:46.681 --> 00:32:47.462]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:33:07.556 --> 00:33:15.239]  All right, Gary, Jim, Gil, Robert, others, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:16.699 --> 00:33:25.762]  We have that military affairs writer and military lawyer coming on in the next hour.
[00:33:25.782 --> 00:33:35.545]  He's one of the experts who was telling the Arizona Republic on Monday's edition that a draft is going to be needed.
[00:33:36.258 --> 00:33:37.319]  In the next year.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.622]  So we'll be talking about the National Draft coming up a little bit in the next hour.
[00:33:43.883 --> 00:33:45.764]  I'm going to go right back to your calls right now.
[00:33:46.585 --> 00:33:50.828]  And then I want to get into this stack of new news articles that came out today.
[00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:55.130]  And you know, that's the great part about this brain trust.
[00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:58.773]  We can outperform the intelligence agencies.
[00:33:58.793 --> 00:34:00.554]  We can outperform the think tanks.
[00:34:01.014 --> 00:34:03.736]  We can outperform the New World Order with the Internet.
[00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:06.837]  Which is really like a big brain in and of itself.
[00:34:07.438 --> 00:34:09.520]  And all of us are little nodes within it.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.882]  Little electrochemical receptors within it.
[00:34:13.623 --> 00:34:16.345]  That's the analogy because there's millions of you out there.
[00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:28.076]  And so I post an article about a bill in Texas to put transponders in all cars when you get your tags to tax and trace you with the toll roads.
[00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:31.719]  And I pointed out that I knew this was going on in other states.
[00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:46.706]  Well, I opened up the email this morning and there were probably about 30 news articles that you had sent that you'd read in your local newspaper from Louisiana, New York, Florida, Oklahoma.
[00:34:47.966 --> 00:34:50.228]  I mean, folks, the stack is gigantic.
[00:34:50.408 --> 00:34:52.309]  I think we posted like 10 of these today.
[00:34:53.269 --> 00:34:55.210]  Or at least I instructed my webmasters to.
[00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:57.732]  So they should be up there on Infowars.com.
[00:34:59.002 --> 00:35:03.366]  And so you're like intelligence analysts out there feeding me all of this info.
[00:35:03.386 --> 00:35:08.730]  I mean, there's no way I could read, you know, the thousands of newspapers that are out there.
[00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.552]  I do scan over hundreds every day.
[00:35:11.872 --> 00:35:15.955]  But all of us together, the brain trust is enormous.
[00:35:16.495 --> 00:35:17.776]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:18.477 --> 00:35:21.599]  And I told you it's happening nationwide, and it is, boys and girls.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.101]  Gary in Tennessee.
[00:35:24.181 --> 00:35:24.862]  Welcome, Gary.
[00:35:25.342 --> 00:35:26.002]  Yeah, how are you?
[00:35:26.343 --> 00:35:26.663]  Good, sir.
[00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.071]  Alright, I've got a question.
[00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:30.893]  I've talked to you the other day.
[00:35:30.913 --> 00:35:34.215]  The schools you were talking about a while ago, where they're making prisons out of and everything.
[00:35:34.436 --> 00:35:36.357]  They are turning the schools into prisons, yes.
[00:35:37.338 --> 00:35:42.182]  What are some of the signs to look for when that starts to happen?
[00:35:42.962 --> 00:35:45.945]  Because like I say, right now we're dealing with that federal prison here in this county.
[00:35:46.865 --> 00:35:48.947]  And I don't know if that's going to be far behind or not.
[00:35:50.225 --> 00:35:51.646]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[00:35:51.706 --> 00:35:53.987]  A lot of elementary schools have fences around them.
[00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:58.230]  The children have to wear RFID necklaces or ID badges with barcodes.
[00:35:58.871 --> 00:36:04.714]  They have to walk to the lunchroom with their hands behind their back, which sounds like discipline, but it's not.
[00:36:04.794 --> 00:36:05.815]  No, no, no.
[00:36:06.395 --> 00:36:10.158]  They have school guards and police even in the elementary with guns.
[00:36:11.859 --> 00:36:19.961]  If a six-year-old slaps another six-year-old, they charge them as a criminal, then get them into the criminal justice system.
[00:36:20.482 --> 00:36:23.402]  No longer do they just discipline them, they just throw them into the system.
[00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:28.964]  They, in the elementary schools, then into the middle schools, have the children write what they call...
[00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:30.950]  This is federally funded.
[00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.531]  A journal about family life.
[00:36:33.971 --> 00:36:38.892]  And then those are scrutinized and given to CPS and given to the police.
[00:36:39.272 --> 00:36:42.232]  You know, what do mommy and daddy have in their medicine cabinet?
[00:36:42.772 --> 00:36:45.933]  But again, don't have people on the border reporting illegal aliens.
[00:36:45.953 --> 00:36:46.913]  They're evil terrorists.
[00:36:47.273 --> 00:36:48.773]  Evil vigilantes, Bush says.
[00:36:48.793 --> 00:36:50.854]  I mean, this just shows how insane it is.
[00:36:52.554 --> 00:36:54.014]  Those are some of the telltale signs.
[00:36:54.554 --> 00:36:55.294]  Drug testing.
[00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:58.595]  It started out, well, if you want to play football, you've got to drug test.
[00:36:59.155 --> 00:36:59.495]  Okay.
[00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:02.409]  Well, now if you want to be in PE, you've got a drug test.
[00:37:02.449 --> 00:37:04.890]  Or now if you want to be on the drill team, you've got a drug test.
[00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:10.271]  Now if you want to park your car as a senior at the school, you've got a drug test.
[00:37:11.051 --> 00:37:14.552]  Now they say everybody's got a drug test in some schools.
[00:37:15.252 --> 00:37:18.012]  So those are examples of how they're turning the schools into prisons.
[00:37:19.113 --> 00:37:19.353]  All right.
[00:37:19.413 --> 00:37:26.674]  I know they sent a, not here long ago, they sent a packet in with the kids, and it has to do with the I.D.,
[00:37:27.452 --> 00:37:28.893]  They want to give the kids ID cards.
[00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:30.654]  Yeah, for any amount of prisoners.
[00:37:30.994 --> 00:37:32.695]  Right, I refuse to do that right now.
[00:37:32.715 --> 00:37:36.177]  I don't know if it's going to be important or not, but I've still got the packet and everything.
[00:37:36.898 --> 00:37:39.860]  It makes a lot of interest in reading.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.362]  But yeah, I just wanted to check on that and see.
[00:37:43.882 --> 00:37:45.463]  I'm getting ready to fax you over or something.
[00:37:45.903 --> 00:37:48.005]  Maybe you'll get a chance to look at that and everything.
[00:37:48.805 --> 00:37:50.586]  But anyway, I just wanted to check on that and see.
[00:37:50.606 --> 00:37:51.387]  I appreciate it.
[00:37:51.907 --> 00:37:52.828]  Thank you, Gary.
[00:37:53.768 --> 00:37:56.330]  And Gary, look at what happened two weeks ago.
[00:37:58.044 --> 00:38:02.566]  Look at what happened up in upstate Minnesota.
[00:38:03.626 --> 00:38:08.448]  The young man, the 16-year-old, told students, I'm going to kill a bunch of people.
[00:38:09.228 --> 00:38:14.430]  They told the police, but because his grandfather was a senior police officer, nothing was done.
[00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:18.372]  He'd been in a mental institution for depression.
[00:38:18.452 --> 00:38:19.592]  They put him on Prozac.
[00:38:20.112 --> 00:38:21.353]  He had a psychotic break.
[00:38:21.953 --> 00:38:22.553]  He walked in.
[00:38:22.593 --> 00:38:23.553]  They had an armed guard.
[00:38:23.573 --> 00:38:26.054]  The armed guard did not stop him.
[00:38:26.394 --> 00:38:27.675]  He blew the armed guard away.
[00:38:30.014 --> 00:38:33.937]  Now, frankly, an armed guard would actually do a little something.
[00:38:33.977 --> 00:38:36.858]  It was another one of the security guards that finally took him out.
[00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:51.647]  But the answer is having the principal, assistant principal, and you shouldn't make the teachers have guns, but I think if teachers nowadays want to have guns, I think they should have an instant access pistol safe under their desk, and that would end school shootings immediately.
[00:38:52.847 --> 00:38:55.369]  If somebody started coming down the hall school shooting and I was a teacher,
[00:38:56.104 --> 00:38:59.706]  I'd just reach in the drawer in the instant access pistol safe.
[00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.166]  That way the students couldn't get it.
[00:39:01.527 --> 00:39:04.388]  I'd draw a bead on them calmly and blow them away.
[00:39:05.248 --> 00:39:17.794]  They had a case in Louisiana a couple years ago where the school shooter was running around shooting people and the assistant principal got the gun out of their car, dealt with the problem, and only one or two people got injured because of it.
[00:39:19.155 --> 00:39:23.577]  Whereas at Columbine, for four hours and 15 minutes...
[00:39:24.733 --> 00:39:27.254]  That's the official number by the Rocky Mountain News.
[00:39:27.754 --> 00:39:32.577]  I had the editor on a few years ago talking about the case, about how the SWAT teams were actually shooting the students.
[00:39:33.297 --> 00:39:39.099]  That was in the Colorado Papers, but the average American doesn't know about it because it was a regionalized, compartmentalized news.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.421]  And the SWAT team sat outside, I said, for three hours.
[00:39:43.461 --> 00:39:46.183]  He goes, no, Mr. Jones, four hours, 15 minutes.
[00:39:46.743 --> 00:39:48.824]  From the time they got there to the time they went in.
[00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:53.446]  And we now know why they stayed back, because they've heard it's freaking out.
[00:39:54.419 --> 00:39:58.040]  The SWAT team panicked and blew away at least two of the students.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.461]  Our numbers are six of the 14.
[00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:05.542]  By the way, that's Denver Post, Rocky Mountain News.
[00:40:05.922 --> 00:40:07.782]  I know you didn't hear about it, so you don't believe it.
[00:40:08.662 --> 00:40:10.983]  It's in Road to Tyranny, by the way, the actual news articles.
[00:40:11.863 --> 00:40:15.604]  And some of the SWAT team members were crying, saying, I'm sorry, I blew the kid away.
[00:40:16.424 --> 00:40:20.025]  And that got swept under the rug real fast, though there have been settlements.
[00:40:21.299 --> 00:40:24.582]  But, I mean, what good is a SWAT team if they sit there for four hours?
[00:40:25.543 --> 00:40:26.723]  Four hours, 15 minutes.
[00:40:27.524 --> 00:40:28.945]  Hope that answers your question, Gary.
[00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:30.326]  Very good question.
[00:40:31.227 --> 00:40:35.130]  But ID badges aren't going to protect you from a mad killer.
[00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.071]  Hopped up on Prozac.
[00:40:37.792 --> 00:40:39.773]  Or hopped up on PCP or LSD.
[00:40:40.494 --> 00:40:41.555]  I mean, it's stupid.
[00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:44.177]  An ID card is going to do absolutely nothing.
[00:40:46.178 --> 00:40:47.079]  It's a joke.
[00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.932]  It trains you how to be a prisoner.
[00:40:52.053 --> 00:40:53.114]  Tim in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:53.134 --> 00:40:53.734]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:40:55.215 --> 00:40:55.856]  Hello, Alex.
[00:40:56.196 --> 00:40:56.576]  Hello.
[00:40:58.278 --> 00:40:59.839]  I just want to say one thing.
[00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:04.823]  You talked yesterday about the WWE dumbing down the people.
[00:41:06.845 --> 00:41:09.467]  You talked about wrestling dumbing down the people.
[00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:10.187]  Yes.
[00:41:11.648 --> 00:41:13.410]  I absolutely agree with that.
[00:41:15.331 --> 00:41:16.052]  By the way, Alex,
[00:41:17.483 --> 00:41:18.684]  I don't know if you watch it.
[00:41:18.964 --> 00:41:21.366]  I quit watching it like about a year ago.
[00:41:22.226 --> 00:41:30.372]  But back in 2002, did you know that they actually had a tag team, NWO, New World Order?
[00:41:30.392 --> 00:41:33.494]  Do you know that, Alex?
[00:41:33.534 --> 00:41:36.917]  Tim, I did know that, yes.
[00:41:36.957 --> 00:41:47.044]  They did actually, since McMahon's WWE, you know, back in 2002, they actually had a tag team called NWO.
[00:41:47.819 --> 00:41:48.379]  No, I know.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.280]  And they were supreme rulers.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.081]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:57.004]  The reason I brought up professional wrestling was an example of staged events.
[00:41:58.544 --> 00:42:02.506]  They say 40, 50 million Americans watch and go to wrestling matches.
[00:42:03.667 --> 00:42:05.708]  And I don't mean Greco-Roman real wrestling.
[00:42:05.948 --> 00:42:06.849]  I find that interesting.
[00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:08.730]  I like to watch that on the Olympics.
[00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.911]  One of the few things I still watch on TV every four years.
[00:42:12.792 --> 00:42:13.612]  I watch a little bit of it.
[00:42:14.993 --> 00:42:17.454]  I mainly like track and field, but wrestling is interesting.
[00:42:18.683 --> 00:42:23.146]  But I'm talking about WWF, WW whatever, wrestling.
[00:42:24.306 --> 00:42:27.188]  Millions of Americans, full-grown adults, believe it is real.
[00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:30.510]  I guess because we've never been in a real fight.
[00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:35.413]  You don't beat people over the head for an hour and people don't live.
[00:42:36.694 --> 00:42:37.854]  It just doesn't work that way.
[00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:42.577]  You punch somebody once or twice full speed, I mean, they're going to be a bloody pulp.
[00:42:43.277 --> 00:42:44.698]  Much less 150 times.
[00:42:45.338 --> 00:42:47.980]  But it's an example of how people believe politics is real.
[00:42:48.726 --> 00:42:51.068]  They believe presidential politics is real.
[00:42:51.088 --> 00:42:53.890]  It is as real as WWF wrestling.
[00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.771]  It is totally staged.
[00:42:57.412 --> 00:43:03.857]  Totally staged, I would say from the evidence, clearly, since the 1992 elections.
[00:43:05.218 --> 00:43:06.199]  Totally staged. 100%.
[00:43:09.986 --> 00:43:11.527]  Bill Clinton and George Bush Sr.
[00:43:11.587 --> 00:43:13.029]  met 11 times before that.
[00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:15.231]  They went to Bilderberg Group meetings.
[00:43:15.811 --> 00:43:17.192]  They dealt cocaine together.
[00:43:17.252 --> 00:43:17.913]  That's admitted.
[00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:21.636]  The meeting in Arkansas, it was totally staged.
[00:43:22.497 --> 00:43:23.438]  It was not a real election.
[00:43:24.899 --> 00:43:26.340]  And now you see all the evidence of that.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.943]  You know, Bill Clinton buddies with George Bush Sr.
[00:43:29.663 --> 00:43:30.504]  George Jr.
[00:43:30.784 --> 00:43:36.009]  protects Bill Clinton, blocks all the documents, tells Congress not to investigate him.
[00:43:37.828 --> 00:43:46.590]  And how much more obvious does it have to get Bob Dole running against Clinton and not putting up a fight?
[00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.831]  Or Al Gore and George Bush?
[00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:53.672]  And then in 2004, two cousins running against each other.
[00:43:54.012 --> 00:43:55.753]  Members of the same secret society.
[00:43:58.288 --> 00:43:59.589]  Gil in Texas.
[00:43:59.669 --> 00:44:00.569]  Gil, go ahead.
[00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:04.391]  It's a beautiful day, Alex, to fight the new world order.
[00:44:04.511 --> 00:44:05.152]  Wouldn't you agree?
[00:44:05.432 --> 00:44:05.912]  Yes, it is.
[00:44:06.252 --> 00:44:07.953]  I've got two questions for you.
[00:44:08.293 --> 00:44:12.175]  In the current climate, what would be the one thing you would like to see happen?
[00:44:14.896 --> 00:44:18.958]  Well, I mean, the world is so complex, there's not one magic silver bullet here.
[00:44:19.058 --> 00:44:21.160]  Okay, well, how about two or three things?
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.820]  And I have another question.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.981]  I'll try to get to it real quick.
[00:44:25.023 --> 00:44:26.024]  I'd have to think about that.
[00:44:26.064 --> 00:44:33.191]  That's a very important, large-scope question, but let me try to just off the top of my head give you three important things.
[00:44:34.152 --> 00:44:40.559]  I would like to see all gun laws repealed, including laws that bar felons from owning guns.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.764]  Because felons don't follow the law anyway, and it's selectively enforced.
[00:44:45.164 --> 00:44:47.507]  Back when we had no gun laws, we had lower crime rates.
[00:44:47.867 --> 00:44:49.669]  I'd like to see all gun laws repealed.
[00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.052]  I'd like to see abortion outlawed.
[00:44:53.954 --> 00:44:58.099]  And I would like to see the Federal Reserve abolished.
[00:44:58.599 --> 00:45:22.305]  I would like to see our borders secured and the 150,000 troops removed from Iraq and 100,000 put on the southern border, 50,000 put on the northern border, state guards on the borders mobilized, beefed up, pay increased, and to put a supplemental state guards on the border with orders to kill Mexican troops if they cross the border one inch, like they kill our federal forces.
[00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:25.385]  And I would like to see the...
[00:45:29.577 --> 00:45:40.262]  I would like to see the 17th Amendment repealed, and the federal senators being removed back to the states under state legislative control.
[00:45:40.282 --> 00:45:43.003]  I would like to see the IRS abolished.
[00:45:43.964 --> 00:45:45.624]  I mean, I could keep going here for a couple hours.
[00:45:45.644 --> 00:45:47.205]  Well, yeah, I better get to the next question.
[00:45:47.385 --> 00:45:53.508]  At the very beginning of your show, you mentioned how fleeting and like a smoke in the air our lives are.
[00:45:54.048 --> 00:45:56.129]  What would you want to be said about you today?
[00:45:57.062 --> 00:45:58.143]  Make copies of my videos!
[00:45:58.183 --> 00:46:01.046]  I mean, I don't want to die for nothing here.
[00:46:01.647 --> 00:46:02.568]  And my videos are very effective.
[00:46:02.588 --> 00:46:03.389]  And just please keep my work alive.
[00:46:21.292 --> 00:46:23.013]  And don't be involved in infighting.
[00:46:23.674 --> 00:46:32.000]  And just keep moving forward and just have hope and know that humanity, with God's help, will win over the New World Order and its master.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.283]  And just love God and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:46:36.323 --> 00:46:38.805]  I mean, I really would just say, be leaders.
[00:46:39.745 --> 00:46:40.626]  Don't be afraid.
[00:46:41.827 --> 00:46:42.507]  Take action.
[00:46:43.908 --> 00:46:44.749]  Amen.
[00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.850]  Bye-bye.
[00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.970]  Take care.
[00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:48.872]  Well, those were really good questions, Gil.
[00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:52.676]  Robert in Colorado.
[00:46:52.736 --> 00:46:53.577]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:46:53.597 --> 00:46:57.301]  Hello, I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.263]  Please make copies of his videos.
[00:46:59.443 --> 00:47:02.206]  Wow, that was a great call.
[00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:03.428]  I don't know how to follow it up.
[00:47:03.508 --> 00:47:04.288]  Good morning, how are you?
[00:47:04.329 --> 00:47:05.210]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:05.830]  I'm pretty good.
[00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.113]  You know, I'm glad you occasionally give people my full name.
[00:47:08.912 --> 00:47:15.534]  Alexander Emmerich Jones, because the only reason I do that sometimes is I'm not Alex S. Jones of the New York Times.
[00:47:15.674 --> 00:47:17.215]  There's a whole bunch of Alex Joneses.
[00:47:17.735 --> 00:47:24.757]  And I'm tired of getting emails from people going, you're a liberal, or you're a whatever, because there's so many Alex Joneses.
[00:47:25.433 --> 00:47:28.315]  Well, while that may be true, Alexander, you've got to be the loudest one.
[00:47:28.855 --> 00:47:30.116]  I think so, yeah.
[00:47:30.236 --> 00:47:38.621]  Hey, man, you didn't get a chance, or did you get a chance to listen to any of Gary Brownfield this morning, the guy that preceded you on GCN Live?
[00:47:38.961 --> 00:47:40.202]  I did listen to some of Gary.
[00:47:40.622 --> 00:47:43.264]  Did you catch that guy who was talking in his book, the former football player?
[00:47:44.405 --> 00:47:44.645]  No.
[00:47:45.305 --> 00:47:48.507]  He's written a book about, I forget his name, I should have wrote it down.
[00:47:48.527 --> 00:47:51.049]  He's written a book about the New World Order and globalism and so forth.
[00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:54.191]  One of the things that struck me is he was drawing a parallel between
[00:47:55.478 --> 00:47:58.859]  The death of the Pope recently and it being somewhat scriptural.
[00:47:59.279 --> 00:48:01.820]  Well, see, I didn't hear... Okay, then I did hear the guy.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.021]  I only heard about 10 minutes when I was driving to the office.
[00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:08.882]  He was talking about the Lusitania and government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:48:08.982 --> 00:48:10.042]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:48:10.523 --> 00:48:11.263]  Who is that guy?
[00:48:12.983 --> 00:48:13.924]  Something Klein.
[00:48:13.944 --> 00:48:15.104]  He used to play in the NFL.
[00:48:16.084 --> 00:48:20.486]  But he's written some books and did a DVD video.
[00:48:20.506 --> 00:48:22.626]  Well, yeah, I heard him saying he's got a video.
[00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:24.387]  Well, I hope somebody sends me his info.
[00:48:24.407 --> 00:48:25.027]  Maybe I'll have him on.
[00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:27.050]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:29.431]  Speaking of videos, I... I mean, you think he was good?
[00:48:29.972 --> 00:48:35.655]  I didn't hear much of it, and I was receiving cell phone calls while listening, so I missed most of it.
[00:48:36.076 --> 00:48:36.916]  He was interesting.
[00:48:36.936 --> 00:48:46.502]  He seemed to think that Muslims were at the root of terrorism, which I don't agree with, but other than that, he had finishing thoughts, though.
[00:48:46.542 --> 00:48:49.684]  Oh, it's kind of the anti-New World Order neocon spin?
[00:48:50.185 --> 00:48:51.185]  That's what I got out of it.
[00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:52.146]  No, that's what I'm doing.
[00:48:52.694 --> 00:48:53.335]  Yeah.
[00:48:53.655 --> 00:48:57.318]  Speaking of videos, I probably got to see your newest one, Rise of the Police State.
[00:48:57.578 --> 00:48:58.418]  Great job, man.
[00:48:58.499 --> 00:49:07.205]  Speaking of which, did you happen to notice that when George Bush took the oath of office, he left out against enemies foreign and domestic?
[00:49:07.686 --> 00:49:11.529]  Yeah, I've never seen a president give that oath, and Cheney gave a totally different oath.
[00:49:11.869 --> 00:49:12.970]  Yeah, yeah, interesting.
[00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:17.754]  Cheney's oath was twice as long, and no, I did notice that, a very cryptic oath.
[00:49:18.314 --> 00:49:19.135]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:49:19.155 --> 00:49:20.716]  I guess that means he doesn't have to protect us.
[00:49:21.312 --> 00:49:24.194]  Well, let me get a 60-second review from you.
[00:49:24.554 --> 00:49:27.036]  I mean, I really haven't been hyping this enough.
[00:49:27.136 --> 00:49:30.458]  It's my best video, but I want to get your opinion of the new film.
[00:49:31.018 --> 00:49:31.458]  Great stuff.
[00:49:31.578 --> 00:49:32.079]  Great stuff.
[00:49:33.079 --> 00:49:33.820]  It's incredible.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.860]  It's incredible.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.601]  I really enjoyed it.
[00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:40.724]  I thought it was interesting how when you were in New York City, you got a real...
[00:49:41.892 --> 00:49:43.695]  Across the board mosaic of opinions.
[00:49:43.735 --> 00:49:46.500]  Some people are calling you names and some people are calling you jerks.
[00:49:46.861 --> 00:49:48.283]  Some people like what you have to say.
[00:49:48.303 --> 00:49:48.985]  Some disagree.
[00:49:49.025 --> 00:49:49.526]  Some agree.
[00:49:49.566 --> 00:49:54.254]  You got a little bit of everything, which is cool because not everyone believes the same thing.
[00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:57.655]  For some it's black and white, for some it's gray.
[00:49:57.695 --> 00:50:00.836]  Well, yeah, I had the communists say that they wanted me dead.
[00:50:01.236 --> 00:50:02.937]  Yes, well, that's an opinion.
[00:50:03.257 --> 00:50:04.818]  It's ridiculous, but still.
[00:50:04.938 --> 00:50:06.639]  So that's what I got.
[00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:10.461]  It was really across the board, but it was very hard-hitting, very factual.
[00:50:10.521 --> 00:50:11.602]  It was a great video, man.
[00:50:11.962 --> 00:50:13.322]  I think I'm going to buy that DVD.
[00:50:13.563 --> 00:50:18.105]  By the way, we didn't go out there to try to get the communists to be... I mean, they were mean to us.
[00:50:18.861 --> 00:50:19.381]  I saw that.
[00:50:19.802 --> 00:50:21.383]  And I'm like, hi, how are you doing?
[00:50:21.443 --> 00:50:23.724]  And, you know, well, too bad Stalin didn't kill you.
[00:50:23.764 --> 00:50:24.664]  And I'm like, excuse me?
[00:50:24.684 --> 00:50:28.747]  Yeah, and when you try to talk to the kids, they couldn't get away from you fast enough.
[00:50:28.767 --> 00:50:31.128]  They were like cockroaches running away from the light.
[00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:33.789]  Yeah, it was sad.
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.690]  Great job.
[00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:41.814]  As you know, five or six days before the Pope passed away, Johnny Cochran also passed away of a brain tumor.
[00:50:42.754 --> 00:50:46.898]  Any thoughts about his life or what he did while he was alive as a lawyer or anything?
[00:50:47.299 --> 00:50:50.522]  You know, I did hear that, and now Peter Jennings has got lung cancer.
[00:50:50.702 --> 00:50:50.922]  Yes.
[00:50:51.223 --> 00:50:53.305]  Let me try to briefly... Well, life is fleeting.
[00:50:53.345 --> 00:50:54.806]  It's like smoke in the wind, folks.
[00:50:55.167 --> 00:50:57.969]  It's like mist in the early morning burned away by the sun.
[00:50:57.989 --> 00:50:59.391]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:08.612]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.912 --> 00:51:10.293]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.474 --> 00:51:12.695]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.835 --> 00:51:14.937]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.217 --> 00:51:20.141]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:24.524]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.764 --> 00:51:26.544]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.624 --> 00:51:37.247]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.407 --> 00:51:39.308]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:27.683]  Bill Carter, a lawyer, military veteran, a writer for military activities and issues, who's been saying we need a new national draft.
[00:54:27.703 --> 00:54:28.923]  We just have to have it.
[00:54:29.423 --> 00:54:31.604]  He's been writing for some major publications saying this.
[00:54:31.644 --> 00:54:33.044]  He's amongst other experts.
[00:54:33.824 --> 00:54:37.265]  We're in a big article carried by the Arizona Republic and Cox News Service
[00:54:38.147 --> 00:54:43.192]  Over the weekend, he'll be joining us coming up for about 30 minutes into the next hour, but we'll also take your calls.
[00:54:44.393 --> 00:54:52.041]  Robert and Brooke and Roman and Patrick and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:54:52.962 --> 00:54:59.688]  You heard the caller, the last caller, mention martial law, 9-11, rise of the police state.
[00:55:00.048 --> 00:55:01.510]  Why such a long headline?
[00:55:04.255 --> 00:55:09.357]  Well, I was arguing with the folks I made the video with about the name, so we just made it longer and had both names in there.
[00:55:10.077 --> 00:55:21.561]  The name of the film, my name for the film is, but I think Marshall Law is a good opening name, but 9-11 Rise of the Police State is really the name of the film.
[00:55:22.721 --> 00:55:29.103]  But I didn't want to get confused with 9-11 Road to Tyranny, the Road to Tyranny, so we, Marshall Law...
[00:55:30.247 --> 00:55:32.008]  9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:55:32.088 --> 00:55:33.689]  It's really three films in one.
[00:55:33.809 --> 00:55:36.251]  And the DVD is a little over three hours long.
[00:55:36.731 --> 00:55:39.072]  The VHS is two and a half hours plus long.
[00:55:40.173 --> 00:55:42.974]  And some will say it's not as effective because it's so long.
[00:55:43.014 --> 00:55:44.175]  And in some cases that's true.
[00:55:45.076 --> 00:55:45.876]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:55:45.896 --> 00:55:48.137]  You can show somebody one of the three acts.
[00:55:48.157 --> 00:55:49.338]  You know, it's done like a play.
[00:55:49.919 --> 00:55:50.919]  But it's the real world.
[00:55:50.939 --> 00:55:55.742]  It's the police state, 9-11, and the occult rulers that run and control it all.
[00:55:57.777 --> 00:56:05.281]  Really, there's a final little ten-minute act where we show Bush giving his swearing in, and then how he's totally violated his oath of office.
[00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:08.062]  You need this video.
[00:56:08.122 --> 00:56:09.182]  It's my best work.
[00:56:10.043 --> 00:56:12.204]  We have it in VHS and DVD.
[00:56:14.145 --> 00:56:22.869]  It's got the DVDs in, and you can order it right now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[00:56:38.782 --> 00:56:39.922]  Don't wait.

[00:57:03.969 --> 00:57:05.089]  So take action today.
[00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:07.829]  Robert in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:57:07.889 --> 00:57:08.309]  Go ahead.
[00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:10.510]  I just talked to Robert.
[00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:11.490]  I'm out of control today.
[00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:15.491]  Okay, Brooke, or Brock, what's wrong with me?
[00:57:16.151 --> 00:57:17.411]  In British Columbia, go ahead.
[00:57:17.871 --> 00:57:18.352]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:18.792 --> 00:57:19.492]  Hello, Brock.
[00:57:19.932 --> 00:57:20.352]  I, um...
[00:57:21.417 --> 00:57:33.069]  I wanted you to encapsulate, if you will, the role of the high-level masons in the New World Order, and I had something to ask you after that, if you don't mind.
[00:57:33.649 --> 00:57:38.935]  Well, they infiltrate the Protestant Church, the Christian Church, the Jewish organizations.
[00:57:39.733 --> 00:57:40.373]  What exactly are they?
[00:57:40.393 --> 00:57:41.254]  I mean, what do they...
[00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:05.852]  And their goal is just to pervert anything and everything they've got their hands on?
[00:58:05.912 --> 00:58:15.896]  Yeah, Skull and Bones is one of their better-known lodges, and that's just one of their elite lodges where they bring in young people.
[00:58:17.937 --> 00:58:18.397]  Oh, boy.
[00:58:18.958 --> 00:58:19.778]  It's a death cult.
[00:58:19.838 --> 00:58:21.779]  I mean, that's what martial law covers.
[00:58:21.819 --> 00:58:23.520]  An hour of the film is about that.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:28.102]  I mean, when you watch the film, you will know who they are.
[00:58:29.224 --> 00:58:36.749]  And I also wanted to ask you about the white slavery rings that are in the UN and government sponsored.
[00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:40.591]  Yeah, we got a call about that yesterday right up against the break.
[00:58:40.611 --> 00:58:41.371]  I never answered it.
[00:58:41.772 --> 00:58:49.837]  What I'll do is, after this guest is gone, I will write a note here and try to talk about this and answer that question.
[00:58:58.041 --> 00:58:58.642]  Big Brother
[00:59:01.439 --> 00:59:03.700]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.441 --> 00:59:05.301]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:09.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.184 --> 00:59:14.326]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.851 --> 00:59:26.112]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:26.152 --> 00:59:28.673]  Now, 30 seconds into this second hour.
[00:59:31.554 --> 00:59:37.256]  On this Wednesday, the sixth day of April 2005, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:37.276 --> 00:59:39.037]  I know the phone lines are loaded.
[00:59:39.057 --> 00:59:40.418]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:59:41.918 --> 00:59:50.662]  Plus, I want to get into President Bush's approval rating at all-time low for a president who's been re-elected in his second term at this point.
[00:59:51.102 --> 00:59:58.665]  The Zogby poll shows overwhelming rejection of gun bans as a terror solution that Bush is now pushing out Clinton and Clinton.
[00:59:59.255 --> 01:00:08.878]  There's talk of Mel Gibson for president, also the Minuteman Project on the southern border, 141 illegals caught so far, simply reporting them to the Border Patrol.
[01:00:09.418 --> 01:00:10.218]  That's all they're doing.
[01:00:10.238 --> 01:00:16.480]  The Border Patrol at the ground level is very supportive, but El Presidente, El Liberal, is against it.
[01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:24.703]  I read an article over the weekend, we posted it on Monday, it was out of the Arizona Republic, originally Cox News Service, quoting a
[01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:40.597]  Phil Carter, who is a lawyer and, of course, a military veteran and writes for major publications on military affairs, and he was one of the experts, quoted as saying we're going to have to have a draft just to continue on in Iraq or to have any two-theater wars.
[01:00:40.977 --> 01:00:45.300]  And that's what the Pentagon's been saying, but there's still denial out there in the public.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.843]  So we're going to break here in a few minutes, but we're honored to have with us for the next 30 minutes Phil Carter.
[01:00:51.183 --> 01:00:52.444]  Phil, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:00:52.824 --> 01:00:53.405]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:54.786 --> 01:00:55.006]  Just...
[01:00:56.397 --> 01:01:00.201]  I mean, you've been writing a lot of editorials about why we need a draft to go over it for us.
[01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:10.770]  Well, I think what you have to do is start with the assumption that we're the world's superpower and that we need to project American power abroad.
[01:01:11.131 --> 01:01:16.596]  And if you accept that assumption, then you've got to look at what supply you need to meet that demand.
[01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:21.380]  As constituted, the all-volunteer force today cannot meet that demand.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.001]  It simply...
[01:01:22.668 --> 01:01:31.895]  Well, I mean, the Secretary of the Army said they need 400,000 troops before they went into Iraq, but he was ignored, the generals were ignored, and things aren't going too well.
[01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:51.907]  That's right.
[01:01:51.987 --> 01:02:00.451]  I mean, the RAND Corporation did a study last summer or two summers ago that looked at how many troops we would need to decisively win the peace in Iraq.
[01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:03.572]  And if you use Bosnia as a model, it would have taken 250,000.
[01:02:03.992 --> 01:02:07.814]  If you use Kosovo as a model, it would have taken 526,000.
[01:02:07.854 --> 01:02:10.795]  And that's a one-shot deal.
[01:02:11.235 --> 01:02:11.935]  The U.S.
[01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:18.318]  Army and Marine Corps combined cannot put that many people on the ground and sustain it over the course of years.
[01:02:20.786 --> 01:02:25.870]  So, forget the invasions of Iran and Syria, but it looks like they're still making preparations for that.
[01:02:26.751 --> 01:02:27.391]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:27.431 --> 01:02:29.973]  And it's unclear where they're going to get the forces necessary.
[01:02:30.073 --> 01:02:36.978]  I mean, we can do some things with air power, and we can do some things with sea power, like deter China from taking over Taiwan.
[01:02:37.038 --> 01:02:40.181]  But, you know, you really do need boots on the ground for some of these missions.
[01:02:40.761 --> 01:02:42.102]  And, frankly, they're not there right now.
[01:02:43.623 --> 01:02:44.003]  All right.
[01:02:44.063 --> 01:02:45.384]  Well, we've got a break here in a second.
[01:02:45.404 --> 01:02:49.868]  I want to come back and recap this and have a discussion about it and go into more detail.
[01:02:52.487 --> 01:02:53.907]  I know you write for a lot of big newspapers.
[01:02:54.367 --> 01:02:56.028]  What are some of the current articles you've written?
[01:02:56.328 --> 01:02:57.408]  What's the best way to find them?
[01:02:58.368 --> 01:02:59.989]  The best way to find them is to Google me.
[01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:04.070]  Philip Carter, plug that into a search engine and you'll pull them all up.
[01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:08.212]  I've read several of them and I totally agree with your analysis.
[01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:09.432]  It's just common sense.
[01:03:09.612 --> 01:03:15.674]  They've introduced legislation to do it, but the Bush administration keeps denying that they've got plans for a draft.
[01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:18.250]  So what gives?
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:22.571]  Two plus two here isn't... I mean, two plus two means a draft.
[01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:25.052]  They're telling us two plus two equals seven.
[01:03:26.232 --> 01:03:28.313]  That's right, and I think some of the issue is political here.
[01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:29.714]  You know, that shouldn't be a surprise.
[01:03:29.754 --> 01:03:31.254]  Everything in Washington is political.
[01:03:31.314 --> 01:03:35.636]  But if you put all the costs of the war on the table ahead of time...
[01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:39.728]  You know, it's unlikely that any American majority is going to support it.
[01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.289]  All right, stay there, Phil.
[01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.889]  We've got a break.
[01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:42.990]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:47.031]  I want to recap all this and then get into more specifics with you.
[01:03:47.612 --> 01:03:50.413]  We're talking to Philip Carter, military analyst, writer.
[01:03:50.433 --> 01:03:50.833]  We'll be back.
[01:03:53.514 --> 01:03:57.876]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.036 --> 01:04:02.498]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.618 --> 01:04:03.418]  There is a chance.
[01:04:04.363 --> 01:04:06.985]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.025 --> 01:04:10.107]  The New World Order can emerge.

[01:07:01.091 --> 01:07:02.172]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.672]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.412 --> 01:07:05.333]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.353 --> 01:07:09.854]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.154 --> 01:07:14.295]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:21.878]  Alright, our guest is an Army veteran of 10 years.
[01:07:22.218 --> 01:07:23.198]  Got out as a captain.
[01:07:24.158 --> 01:07:25.219]  And he's also a lawyer.
[01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:26.199]  He writes for
[01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:33.956]  Major magazines and newspapers in this country as a military analyst and commentator.
[01:07:34.856 --> 01:07:38.719]  And he was quoted in a Cox News Service article that I saw in the Arizona Republic.
[01:07:38.759 --> 01:07:48.125]  We posted it as a headline on Monday at InfoWars.com concerning how military analysts say we're going to need a draft.
[01:07:49.086 --> 01:07:51.908]  And again, that's what Secretary of the Army said before they kicked him out.
[01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:56.191]  White said they sent 400,000 troops at least in Iraq to get the job done.
[01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:58.655]  They're now doing stop-loss.
[01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:01.516]  People who've already been in for five, ten years, they say, sorry, you can't leave.
[01:08:01.956 --> 01:08:05.958]  Or reserves who were promised they'd never be needed overseas.
[01:08:05.978 --> 01:08:07.778]  Oh, you're going to be in theater two years.
[01:08:07.838 --> 01:08:09.379]  Well, now four years.
[01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:10.739]  Well, we're never going to let you leave.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.560]  All of this is happening.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.201]  They've set up the draft boards again.
[01:08:14.701 --> 01:08:16.682]  They've doubled the funding for selective service.
[01:08:17.742 --> 01:08:20.403]  Republicans and Democrats have entered into these bills.
[01:08:20.423 --> 01:08:24.985]  They call it a joke by Rangel out of New York, the congressman, but it's not just Rangel.
[01:08:26.348 --> 01:08:28.129]  We've got Republicans introducing these bills.
[01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:30.130]  Universal Service Act.
[01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.431]  Men and women being drafted.
[01:08:32.491 --> 01:08:38.014]  Bush tried to use Private Lynch as a poster girl for women in front-line military action.
[01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:44.357]  So this is all happening, and talking to Philip Carter, for those that missed the last segment...
[01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:51.073]  Phil, let's just go over the facts, the different Rand Corporation and Army and Pentagon studies.
[01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.575]  They have to have a draft just to stay in Iraq.
[01:08:55.516 --> 01:09:04.882]  I mean, the Republican Guard that's now been turned into the National Guard of Iraq, they're not doing a good job.
[01:09:05.182 --> 01:09:07.503]  I mean, just go over it for us.
[01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:08.504]  Give us your analysis.
[01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:12.186]  Let's say you had three minutes on national TV to give folks your analysis.
[01:09:12.506 --> 01:09:13.407]  Give us your testimony.
[01:09:14.722 --> 01:09:15.543]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:09:16.223 --> 01:09:25.067]  The issue right now is how we're going to sustain an involvement of 140,000 to 150,000 US troops in Iraq for the long term.
[01:09:25.968 --> 01:09:35.832]  Since the invasion two years ago, and it's important to note that tomorrow will be the anniversary of the thunder run that took Baghdad, we've rotated more than 400,000 US troops through Iraq.
[01:09:38.576 --> 01:09:47.726]  And the most recent rotations have become increasingly composed of reserve units because we've already run through all of the active duty units.
[01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:51.490]  And truth be told, we've run through a lot of the reservists as well.
[01:09:52.591 --> 01:10:00.219]  And most folks in the Pentagon say that in mid-2006 we're going to run out of everything.
[01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:18.076]  And at that point, we're either going to need to reconstitute parts of the reserves that have been to Iraq before or been to Iraq and Afghanistan or another deployment before and that essentially need to be put back together to replace the soldiers who got out after that deployment.
[01:10:19.157 --> 01:10:23.400]  And then we're going to start seeing people on the active side deploy for the third or fourth time.
[01:10:24.781 --> 01:10:27.843]  And at a certain point, you have to wonder...
[01:10:28.926 --> 01:10:33.288]  Whether the current structure is good enough or whether we need something else to bring people in the door.
[01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:40.972]  Both the Army and the Marines have not been able to meet their recruiting targets recently, and the reserves have been even worse.
[01:10:41.552 --> 01:10:56.100]  And it's unclear whether the all-volunteer force can continue to bring in the people it needs into the front door to meet this commitment of 150,000, which, in my opinion, is going to continue for at least two or three years.
[01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:09.724]  Now, at the same time, the billboards are everywhere, the TV ads are everywhere, you go to a movie, there might be two military ads, they're recruiting all over the inner cities, targeting the disadvantaged.
[01:11:09.744 --> 01:11:11.626]  I mean, I've never seen a press like this.
[01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:13.933]  And they're still not getting their numbers.
[01:11:13.973 --> 01:11:20.299]  They do tricks in the services, like lowering their recruiting target to claim, oh, we didn't miss our target.
[01:11:20.599 --> 01:11:23.882]  But the Marines historically have always not had a problem.
[01:11:23.983 --> 01:11:29.467]  As you said, they're having a big problem, even though they're seen as an elite force that people want to be in.
[01:11:30.068 --> 01:11:34.412]  And now they're doing this stop-loss, which is basically slavery.
[01:11:34.432 --> 01:11:37.675]  I mean, somebody's already served, and then you say, okay, sorry.
[01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:40.211]  You've got to go back for another year.
[01:11:40.752 --> 01:11:42.853]  I mean, even in World War II they didn't do that.
[01:11:42.913 --> 01:11:45.355]  Even in Vietnam they didn't do that.
[01:11:45.655 --> 01:11:49.317]  These are people that have already served, and they're saying, you've got to go back now.
[01:11:49.978 --> 01:11:51.258]  I've read the military studies.
[01:11:51.299 --> 01:11:53.220]  They know most people fall apart.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:12:05.528]  If you try to put them in these high-stress, high-combat guerrilla zones for more than a tour, the Pentagon knows that it's like tires on a truck.
[01:12:05.948 --> 01:12:07.649]  We're going to have more and more blowouts.
[01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:08.689]  This just isn't going to work.
[01:12:08.929 --> 01:12:12.890]  The gas runs out in mid-2006, and I think that's conservative.
[01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:16.411]  I think a lot of military analysts are saying sooner, so what are they going to do?
[01:12:16.811 --> 01:12:19.672]  Well, you know, I don't know that I would call it slavery.
[01:12:19.952 --> 01:12:25.694]  Whenever someone joins the military, they sign a contract that has a lot of fine print, and this is in there.
[01:12:25.714 --> 01:12:33.196]  But you're a lawyer, but they've looked at that fine print, and some federal courts have been ruling, though, that it doesn't really say that.
[01:12:34.613 --> 01:12:37.954]  Almost all the courts that have heard this have said it's a legitimate deal.
[01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:44.076]  Very rarely does a challenge to stop loss or a challenge to an enlistment contract ever go through.
[01:12:44.096 --> 01:12:46.477]  So you're not just for the draft then, Captain.
[01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:49.378]  You are for the stop loss.
[01:12:49.998 --> 01:13:00.841]  No, I think the use of stop loss and other measures belies an unwillingness on the Pentagon's part to look at the underlying problem, which is, quite frankly, we don't have enough troops to do the job.
[01:13:01.514 --> 01:13:12.264]  And so instead of addressing that head on and having a public debate about how to get the troops, they are using all the measures at their disposal to overstretch today's military.
[01:13:12.945 --> 01:13:17.850]  And so you have units from the Army and the Marines going back for their third time in Iraq.
[01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:21.373]  And frankly, that is not good personnel policy.
[01:13:21.413 --> 01:13:24.496]  As you say, we are going to have people who reach their breaking point.
[01:13:25.639 --> 01:13:32.084]  Well, I mean, from the studies I've seen, and you obviously know more about this than I do, but I've had generals and admirals on retired about this.
[01:13:32.564 --> 01:13:34.025]  They say that's very abusive.
[01:13:35.106 --> 01:13:41.530]  It is, and, you know, it's taken us 30 years to build this all-volunteer military since Vietnam.
[01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.712]  It's only going to take us three to break it.
[01:13:45.273 --> 01:13:48.555]  The force today is at a very delicate point.
[01:13:48.935 --> 01:13:49.996]  What you're seeing now...
[01:13:50.703 --> 01:13:50.983]  I think so.
[01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:24.124]  Have to worry about that point where the next dollar is not going to bring in the recruitment.
[01:14:24.144 --> 01:14:27.427]  But a lot of the Guard people are now on welfare and food stamps.
[01:14:27.567 --> 01:14:29.488]  They're getting treated even worse.
[01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:40.537]  The Reserves have always had issues where their soldiers make more in the civilian sector than they do on a military salary.
[01:14:41.998 --> 01:14:45.140]  I think what this war has been is a reality check for the reserves.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.203]  Well, I'm sure you've heard those, sir, that they're foreclosing on reservist homes even though they're not supposed to.
[01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:52.084]  And that's illegal.
[01:14:52.324 --> 01:15:00.728]  And there have been some reports in the New York Times recently about how major creditors and major banks are engaging in practices that are flatly wrong.
[01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:02.232]  Thank you.
[01:15:02.292 --> 01:15:02.632]  Thank you.
[01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:25.677]  Well, look, bottom line, we got lied to about this war, about the weapons of mass destruction.
[01:15:25.717 --> 01:15:27.718]  Now they're telling us they never said it was about that.
[01:15:27.758 --> 01:15:28.638]  It's about elections.
[01:15:29.218 --> 01:15:29.679]  Whatever.
[01:15:30.319 --> 01:15:31.239]  Our troops are there.
[01:15:32.419 --> 01:15:33.180]  It's imploding.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.220]  It's falling apart.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.421]  The insurgency is getting worse on a daily basis.
[01:15:38.372 --> 01:15:48.560]  And the military told, the think tanks told the White House, a bunch of chicken hawks, most have never been in the military, that you can't do this.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.404]  They still did this, and they need to be held accountable for what they've done.
[01:15:54.484 --> 01:15:57.847]  Now, I know you can still be called up, you don't want to get into that, but...
[01:15:58.947 --> 01:15:59.888]  I mean, this is wrong.
[01:16:00.248 --> 01:16:02.630]  Now they're talking about going into Syria and Iran.
[01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:05.412]  They're deploying special forces to the regions.
[01:16:05.432 --> 01:16:08.634]  They've got carrier groups out there that they're talking about going in.
[01:16:08.654 --> 01:16:13.878]  They've got a war council with Sharon in a week and a half down the street from me in Crawford, Texas.
[01:16:13.938 --> 01:16:14.979]  I mean, what do you see happening?
[01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:18.501]  I think the storm clouds are on the horizon.
[01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:28.188]  The interesting thing is that the President has told Iran through Europe that all options are on the table, but at the same time he's said a draft is not on the table.
[01:16:28.558 --> 01:16:34.422]  You know, this is very similar to President Clinton's strategic blunder during the Kosovo War where he said ground forces are not on the table.
[01:16:34.963 --> 01:16:42.048]  When you signal to your enemies that you're unwilling to do something, you essentially telegraph to them the level of your commitment.
[01:16:42.508 --> 01:16:47.472]  And you let them know that if they can just wait it out a little bit, or if they can just gut it out, they can win.
[01:16:47.992 --> 01:16:51.114]  I think we have to be serious that all options are on the table.
[01:16:51.194 --> 01:16:52.135]  But I want to ask you again.
[01:16:53.426 --> 01:16:58.287]  All of the brass told, according to what I've read, told the White House this isn't going to work.
[01:16:58.627 --> 01:17:00.207]  And Franks finally said, okay, we'll do it.
[01:17:01.228 --> 01:17:01.868]  Yes, man.
[01:17:02.088 --> 01:17:05.028]  And now it's a disaster.
[01:17:06.069 --> 01:17:07.709]  So no one's going to be held accountable for that.
[01:17:08.309 --> 01:17:08.689]  That's right.
[01:17:09.749 --> 01:17:10.190]  That's right.
[01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:19.591]  The brass told the Pentagon and the White House in late 2002 and early 2003 what it would take to decisively win the war and the peace.
[01:17:20.452 --> 01:17:22.092]  And the Pentagon chose instead...
[01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:25.633]  To use a war plan that went light on the troops.
[01:17:26.354 --> 01:17:28.615]  And as a result, it did not have the forces it needed.
[01:17:28.715 --> 01:17:31.317]  Because Rumsfeld believes in this blitzkrieg business.
[01:17:32.098 --> 01:17:40.264]  Yeah, he got sold down the river by the success in Afghanistan, which, by the way, is another example of where we haven't had enough troops to decisively win the peace.
[01:17:41.145 --> 01:17:44.827]  And they believed that they would be greeted as liberators, and they still believe that.
[01:17:45.868 --> 01:17:48.370]  And that, I think, is informing their optimistic views
[01:17:49.146 --> 01:17:54.910]  Yeah, it shows they're delusional.
[01:17:55.651 --> 01:17:56.952]  We've got a break when we get back.
[01:17:56.992 --> 01:18:05.238]  I want to talk about, from your sources and your studies of this, Mr. Carter, how you think this war with Iran or Syria is going to start.
[01:18:05.578 --> 01:18:06.599]  You talked about China.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:12.743]  China's armed to the teeth, and we're not even helping Taiwan, that they weren't even invited for the inauguration.
[01:18:13.383 --> 01:18:15.365]  So it looks like Taiwan's being cut loose.
[01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:18.502]  I want to discuss that in the final segment with you.
[01:18:18.522 --> 01:18:21.023]  I know you've got to go catch an airplane here in an hour or so.
[01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:25.005]  And I want to talk about terrorist attacks.
[01:18:25.025 --> 01:18:27.145]  You know, why is Bush so confident?
[01:18:28.086 --> 01:18:31.367]  Folks, if there's another terrorist attack in this country, that's how they're going to get their draft.
[01:18:32.628 --> 01:18:32.948]  Uh-huh.
[01:18:33.748 --> 01:18:35.589]  And why are our borders still wide open?
[01:18:36.349 --> 01:18:40.971]  So we'll come back and talk to Phil Carter, military analyst, military writer for major publications.
[01:18:41.793 --> 01:18:44.595]  And we'll continue after this quick break.
[01:18:44.895 --> 01:18:46.176]  Then we'll take your phone calls.
[01:18:47.036 --> 01:18:49.978]  Don't forget the new website, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:18:49.998 --> 01:18:50.838]  Well, it's not that new.
[01:18:50.858 --> 01:18:51.839]  It's almost a year old now.
[01:18:53.783 --> 01:18:57.066]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:57.106 --> 01:19:01.310]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:04.332]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:06.934]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:07.115 --> 01:19:15.762]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:15.942 --> 01:19:17.303]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:21.647]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:23.687]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:19:23.948 --> 01:19:35.890]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:42.672]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:46.013]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:51.735]  We're good to go.

[01:20:53.171 --> 01:21:00.113]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:21:01.371 --> 01:21:05.434]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:21:06.155 --> 01:21:13.221]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:22.869]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:21:54.497 --> 01:21:55.658]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:55.938 --> 01:22:00.921]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:01.181 --> 01:22:03.783]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:12.508]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:12.908 --> 01:22:21.355]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[01:23:01.895 --> 01:23:02.996]  All right, my friends.
[01:23:03.976 --> 01:23:05.356]  We're talking to Phillip Carter.
[01:23:05.576 --> 01:23:08.937]  Military analyst writes...
[01:23:10.074 --> 01:23:15.297]  Commentary for major publications, and he's been writing some articles about how, well, we need a draft.
[01:23:17.658 --> 01:23:19.259]  I personally am against a draft.
[01:23:19.319 --> 01:23:20.640]  It is conscription.
[01:23:22.181 --> 01:23:31.886]  And really, it is a form of slavery, especially when they get you in there and use these experimental vaccines on you and have you breathe the depleted uranium.
[01:23:32.926 --> 01:23:37.889]  But if our leaders want to be military adventurers and travel around the planet...
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.560]  Then they're going to need one.
[01:23:42.581 --> 01:23:45.721]  They are gearing up with the draft boards, as we said earlier, and the rest of it.
[01:23:47.262 --> 01:23:50.482]  Phil, from your military sources, as you said, storm clouds on the horizon.
[01:23:50.602 --> 01:23:51.863]  They're really gearing up right now.
[01:23:51.883 --> 01:23:54.023]  Do you think it will be Iran or Syria?
[01:23:54.043 --> 01:24:02.685]  Do you think when we move against them, do you think you'll see China, who's openly saying they may invade Taiwan, go ahead and jump on Taiwan?
[01:24:04.185 --> 01:24:04.465]  I think
[01:24:05.734 --> 01:24:11.756]  The most imminent threat we face right now is Iran, and that's because of the threat of nuclear weapons.
[01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:13.756]  You know, that's not something we can ignore.
[01:24:14.056 --> 01:24:17.557]  Well, if that's the case, then you're not worried about Pakistan or China or North Korea?
[01:24:18.317 --> 01:24:20.918]  I think I'm very worried about North Korea.
[01:24:21.438 --> 01:24:25.659]  I'm less worried about Pakistan and India just because we've had some diplomatic success there.
[01:24:25.699 --> 01:24:30.581]  There could be a coup there tomorrow, and the puppet Musharraf could be out.
[01:24:30.901 --> 01:24:31.281]  That's right.
[01:24:31.761 --> 01:24:31.941]  I'm...
[01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:39.049]  I'm very skeptical of these things, but it's hard to say.
[01:24:41.051 --> 01:24:45.595]  So you really think Iran is a threat, even though they've got inspectors coming out their ears?
[01:24:49.638 --> 01:24:54.542]  Iran is a threat in the same way that Iraq was theoretically a threat.
[01:24:55.243 --> 01:24:58.566]  Assuming all the information is true, which is a giant leap of faith,
[01:24:59.142 --> 01:25:03.384]  We have to be worried about a state that develops nuclear weapons, whether they're a friend or an ally.
[01:25:03.784 --> 01:25:12.769]  We just have to be able to keep tabs on them and ensure they're going to own those things properly and legitimately, and that they're going to secure them properly.
[01:25:12.849 --> 01:25:15.510]  We don't keep tabs on Israel with 200 devices.
[01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:19.912]  I don't know that we don't keep tabs on them.
[01:25:20.233 --> 01:25:22.974]  They're saying they reserve the right to start nuking people.
[01:25:23.809 --> 01:25:27.471]  Well, every sovereign state reserves the right to defend itself.
[01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:31.412]  I worry about the amount of fissile material left in the former Soviet Union.
[01:25:31.472 --> 01:25:38.735]  I worry about the production of these machines in Europe that could be proliferated to countries trying to get nuclear weapons.
[01:25:39.075 --> 01:25:45.298]  Hey, why do you think, Captain, why do you think the neocons want Iran so bad?
[01:25:48.799 --> 01:25:51.160]  They have a vision of the Middle East that...
[01:25:51.707 --> 01:25:56.848]  Well, I mean this claim of stabilizing things by taking over Iraq, it's only made people hate us even more.
[01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.531]  Right.
[01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:24.632]  So where do you stand?
[01:26:24.672 --> 01:26:25.572]  I mean, what do you believe?
[01:26:27.213 --> 01:26:38.061]  I believe that we, as a nation, need to pursue our interests broadly defined and taking into account all the costs and all the benefits in the long term.
[01:26:38.101 --> 01:26:48.028]  So do you agree with the analysis of some of the people, you know, with the Pentagon's new map of the gap and taking over all these third world countries?
[01:26:48.048 --> 01:26:49.188]  I mean, those aren't our interests.
[01:26:49.208 --> 01:26:50.769]  Those are the interests of...
[01:26:52.185 --> 01:26:54.747]  Of Wall Street and corporate interests.
[01:26:55.387 --> 01:27:04.874]  Well, no, I don't agree with Tom Barnett's book, The Pentagon's New Map, but I do think that it raises some issues as far as how we can engage the rest of the world.
[01:27:04.894 --> 01:27:08.377]  I mean, I don't think military power is the answer to all of these problems.
[01:27:08.417 --> 01:27:10.058]  He's telling us China's our buddy.
[01:27:11.099 --> 01:27:13.701]  China may well be a good buddy to have in the next century.
[01:27:14.561 --> 01:27:18.324]  If we can engage China better through economic and political means, then we ought to do so.
[01:27:18.999 --> 01:27:26.624]  Because it is a big boy on the block in Asia, and we are going to have increasingly convergent interests with Asia in the next century.
[01:27:29.065 --> 01:27:30.946]  Oh, so do you think we're going to see a draft?
[01:27:30.986 --> 01:27:36.050]  I think we're going to have a convenient terror attack, and I think we're going to see a draft.
[01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:39.272]  And I think that's why the government's so confident.
[01:27:41.013 --> 01:27:41.333]  I don't know.
[01:27:41.353 --> 01:27:46.476]  You know, I hope there's never another terror attack on the United States, but if it happens, I think
[01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:54.935]  And do you support that?
[01:27:55.215 --> 01:28:00.058]  I support it for its own reasons.
[01:28:00.198 --> 01:28:03.360]  I would not want to see an attack on U.S.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:10.665]  soil, and I would not want to see all of the other policies that resulted from that, such as increased law enforcement powers and so forth.
[01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:14.368]  But is that the talk, though, in the military circles, that there'll be an attack and we'll get the draft?
[01:28:15.743 --> 01:28:23.707]  I don't know that that's the talk, but I think that everyone realizes that another draft will create a state of, another attack would create a state of emergency that might lead to it.
[01:28:23.888 --> 01:28:25.148]  Well, that's what Tommy Frank said.
[01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:29.431]  All right, well, Phil Carter, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:28:29.491 --> 01:28:33.113]  It was enlightening, and I appreciate you joining us.
[01:28:33.133 --> 01:28:34.113]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:28:34.433 --> 01:28:34.894]  Take care.
[01:28:35.694 --> 01:28:36.815]  Come back, take your calls.
[01:28:36.855 --> 01:28:41.137]  First, I'll comment on what he had to say and answer a question from earlier from a caller.
[01:28:43.956 --> 01:28:44.857]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.358 --> 01:28:46.962]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.884 --> 01:28:50.569]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.118 --> 01:29:01.600]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:06.261]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:13.523]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.903 --> 01:29:20.005]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.145 --> 01:29:21.365]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.425 --> 01:29:22.026]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:41.628]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:29:41.648 --> 01:29:41.788]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.808 --> 01:29:41.868]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.988 --> 01:29:42.829]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.889 --> 01:29:43.149]  Call today.
[01:29:53.795 --> 01:29:55.415]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.555 --> 01:29:59.636]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.796 --> 01:30:02.677]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:09.478]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.658 --> 01:30:12.659]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.859 --> 01:30:15.259]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.379 --> 01:30:19.940]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:34.866]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:43.989]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4485.
[01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:47.310]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:47.731 --> 01:30:51.632]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.993 --> 01:30:57.154]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[01:30:57.334 --> 01:31:00.055]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[01:31:00.235 --> 01:31:01.636]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[01:31:01.796 --> 01:31:11.759]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[01:31:11.919 --> 01:31:13.660]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:17.803]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[01:31:18.043 --> 01:31:22.506]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:31:22.666 --> 01:31:26.508]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[01:31:26.748 --> 01:31:32.832]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:31:33.272 --> 01:31:34.112]  We're good to go.
[01:31:34.152 --> 01:31:35.093]  We're good to go.
[01:32:05.511 --> 01:32:10.092]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:10.112 --> 01:32:12.353]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:32:12.373 --> 01:32:18.415]  We're about to go to Patrick and Phillip and Ron and Michael and Bruce and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:32:18.435 --> 01:32:21.376]  Let me just comment on the last guest.
[01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:26.298]  He's out there writing editorials everywhere telling us how good a draft will be.
[01:32:26.318 --> 01:32:28.699]  And you heard him.
[01:32:29.702 --> 01:32:39.030]  Clearly, after there's another terror attack, and we know who will be behind that, our globalist friends, then we will get the national conscription.
[01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:40.671]  And that will be slavery.
[01:32:41.752 --> 01:32:44.014]  And that's why you see this arrogance and this confidence.
[01:32:44.054 --> 01:32:52.481]  Get us into the region, get us in there, have an attack, blame it on Iran or Syria, have a national draft, get the giant force, go in there.
[01:32:53.602 --> 01:32:56.725]  Meanwhile, our government is going to allow China to have Taiwan...
[01:32:57.475 --> 01:32:59.636]  That's a prerequisite for their new world order.
[01:33:02.398 --> 01:33:05.480]  And it's a tragedy.
[01:33:06.901 --> 01:33:08.022]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:12.505]  My children will never be drafted by this corrupt, evil government.
[01:33:14.753 --> 01:33:16.714]  I mean, they won't even put troops on the border, folks.
[01:33:16.734 --> 01:33:21.537]  They'll go after the people that are down there just reporting to the Border Patrol what the illegals are doing.
[01:33:21.577 --> 01:33:25.179]  The President's calling them, you know, despicable vigilantes.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.801]  But then, oh, but spy on your neighbors.
[01:33:29.742 --> 01:33:31.763]  Homeland Security isn't about protecting this country.
[01:33:31.783 --> 01:33:35.185]  It's about turning this country into a nightmare police state.
[01:33:36.506 --> 01:33:38.748]  And we had a comment from a caller in the last hour.
[01:33:38.808 --> 01:33:39.808]  I didn't have time to answer.
[01:33:40.308 --> 01:33:40.949]  He was asking...
[01:33:42.691 --> 01:33:44.652]  About the Masons and how they run things.
[01:33:45.573 --> 01:33:49.836]  He was asking about the government-run white slavery rings.
[01:33:52.758 --> 01:34:03.044]  And again, it's like the CIA or it's like the Baptist Church or the Catholic Church or the Jewish groups.
[01:34:04.885 --> 01:34:10.289]  The globalists are in power because they're good at getting control of major organizations.
[01:34:12.068 --> 01:34:13.649]  That's why they're symbols of the pyramid.
[01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:21.395]  They have control of the capstone, hence they control the entire pyramidal structure, or top-down authoritarian system.
[01:34:24.097 --> 01:34:31.723]  And all the major old institutions, and then the new ones that they spawn are New World Order controlled.
[01:34:34.025 --> 01:34:37.488]  And so Masons are listening right now, and they get real mad if I criticize them.
[01:34:38.382 --> 01:34:40.403]  Well, we're not into Luciferian worship.
[01:34:40.423 --> 01:34:41.643]  We're a Christian organization.
[01:34:42.084 --> 01:34:43.524]  Oh yeah, what degree are you?
[01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:46.926]  I have the writings of 33rd degree Masons.
[01:34:48.106 --> 01:34:51.267]  Of the patriarchs of your orders.
[01:34:52.368 --> 01:35:02.172]  I understand that they're basically a foyer or an opening doorway into the occult New World Order.
[01:35:03.988 --> 01:35:05.149]  That's what people get confused.
[01:35:05.169 --> 01:35:06.890]  They go, well, is it the Rosicrucians?
[01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:08.291]  Or is it the Illuminati?
[01:35:08.331 --> 01:35:09.392]  Or is it the Masons?
[01:35:09.472 --> 01:35:10.773]  Or is it the Catholics?
[01:35:10.813 --> 01:35:11.774]  Or is it the Jews?
[01:35:11.814 --> 01:35:12.894]  Or is it the Protestants?
[01:35:13.195 --> 01:35:14.475]  Who runs the New World Order?
[01:35:14.495 --> 01:35:15.796]  Well, is it the CIA?
[01:35:15.836 --> 01:35:18.538]  Or is it the KGB that runs it?
[01:35:18.578 --> 01:35:33.569]  Or is it the... If you look at who's in the Bilderberg Group, and who then is the major heads of media, and who's the head of the CFR, and who's the head of the CIA, you're talking about a couple hundred people
[01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:37.827]  Who are members of all these organizations.
[01:35:38.947 --> 01:35:44.809]  And these organizations all carry out different aims and different operations of the larger system.
[01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:53.851]  People who are Bohemian Grove top members, or top members of Skull and Bones, or top members of the Bilderberg Group, or top members of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:35:55.205 --> 01:36:06.050]  And then you've got minions who are members of all those other organizations who think they've hit the top of the pyramid, which they are in high-level organizations, but they're still a few levels down from the capstone.
[01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:08.931]  And this is how an intelligence agency operates.
[01:36:09.391 --> 01:36:10.812]  It's how Shembet operates.
[01:36:10.872 --> 01:36:13.273]  It's how the KGB, today the FSB.
[01:36:13.513 --> 01:36:15.253]  It's how the CIA, the NSA.
[01:36:15.714 --> 01:36:17.834]  It's need-to-know compartmentalization.
[01:36:18.215 --> 01:36:19.615]  This is the pyramid structure.
[01:36:19.915 --> 01:36:21.456]  Hence, it's the New World Order symbol.
[01:36:25.583 --> 01:36:26.884]  So I hope that answers your question.
[01:36:27.004 --> 01:36:37.592]  And the major corporations, the intelligence agencies, the argument was, well, we've got to control the drug dealing so other groups don't get control of the drug dealing and use it to outmaneuver us.
[01:36:37.672 --> 01:36:42.696]  Oh, we've got to control the white slavery trade, or somebody else will get it, and it'll be a good funding mechanism.
[01:36:42.736 --> 01:36:44.737]  We hate to do it, but we've got to do it.
[01:36:45.558 --> 01:36:46.479]  That total dominance.
[01:36:47.039 --> 01:36:49.841]  And really, there are a bunch of sickos at the top who just enjoy all this.
[01:36:50.102 --> 01:36:50.602]  They're evil.
[01:36:51.812 --> 01:36:54.532]  Well, we've got to carry out terror attacks to blame it on the commies.
[01:36:55.113 --> 01:36:57.773]  We've got to carry out terror attacks to blame it on the terrorists.
[01:36:59.033 --> 01:37:02.574]  Because they're terrorists, and we've got to be more evil than they are.
[01:37:02.594 --> 01:37:07.095]  The truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies.
[01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:15.516]  These little mortal mind games... Well, we've got to use the power of the dark side to defeat the dark side.
[01:37:15.536 --> 01:37:18.256]  Because it's so powerful.
[01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:21.097]  But once you take a bite out of the dark side...
[01:37:21.801 --> 01:37:27.567]  You're forever fallen, folks, once you really join it, once you make that sick decision.
[01:37:27.587 --> 01:37:43.662]  Because I've talked to globalists, I've interviewed globalists, I've read their publications, and, well, the world is so evil, and there's so many evil people out there, we've got to be more evil than anyone else to outmaneuver the other evil groups.
[01:37:45.057 --> 01:37:54.384]  Because we secretly guard the light, and the end justifies the means of survival of the fittest, and we hate what we're doing, but we've got to do it, or somebody else will do it.
[01:37:54.424 --> 01:37:55.765]  It's just the nature of things.
[01:37:56.805 --> 01:38:02.149]  We've got to have world government to stop a nuclear exchange or a biological weapons release.
[01:38:02.469 --> 01:38:10.355]  Meanwhile, they're handing out the nuclear weapons and biologicals, and telling us that Iran's a threat, but don't worry about China and Pakistan.
[01:38:10.695 --> 01:38:11.396]  It's a joke!
[01:38:14.952 --> 01:38:17.413]  And so you're going to wake up one morning and it's going to be on the news.
[01:38:18.873 --> 01:38:20.273]  Cleveland, Ohio today.
[01:38:20.333 --> 01:38:21.573]  Chicago, Illinois today.
[01:38:21.673 --> 01:38:22.614]  Dallas, Texas today.
[01:38:22.634 --> 01:38:23.654]  Houston, Texas today.
[01:38:24.154 --> 01:38:25.174]  Whatever city they hit.
[01:38:26.214 --> 01:38:27.075]  Denver, Colorado.
[01:38:27.115 --> 01:38:28.135]  Los Angeles, California.
[01:38:28.615 --> 01:38:29.295]  San Francisco.
[01:38:29.335 --> 01:38:31.515]  The governor's there saving the victims.
[01:38:31.776 --> 01:38:34.136]  Despite the radiation problems, the governor went in.
[01:38:34.416 --> 01:38:35.276]  He's so valiant.
[01:38:35.516 --> 01:38:38.397]  Shouldn't we amend the Constitution for him after what he did?
[01:38:38.417 --> 01:38:43.398]  The governor's in the hospital recuperating from radiation exposure.
[01:38:44.361 --> 01:38:45.542]  What an incredible hero.
[01:38:45.923 --> 01:38:50.947]  We should really give him the gift of repealing the section of the Constitution so he can be our president.
[01:38:50.967 --> 01:38:52.829]  I mean, I can see it all now, folks.
[01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:56.392]  Look at the governor hauling out the children himself.
[01:38:58.514 --> 01:38:59.675]  You can see these scenarios.
[01:38:59.695 --> 01:39:00.976]  You can war game these out.
[01:39:01.597 --> 01:39:04.479]  Off of how they've been pre-brainwashing us before it happens.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.981]  Well, like President Bush.
[01:39:07.021 --> 01:39:08.523]  Well, I never thought we'd do it, but yes.
[01:39:09.272 --> 01:39:09.933]  We've been hit hard.
[01:39:09.953 --> 01:39:11.053]  We're going to have to have a draft.
[01:39:11.093 --> 01:39:13.876]  Well, I never thought I'd be for it, but all right, pass it.
[01:39:14.476 --> 01:39:15.917]  Now pass the draft, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:17.278]  Young people are lining up.
[01:39:22.602 --> 01:39:28.066]  And then they'll only need this draft for another five years, because in five years half the military is going to be robotic.
[01:39:29.207 --> 01:39:30.408]  Ground forces, air forces.
[01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:32.269]  That's mainstream news.
[01:39:32.289 --> 01:39:33.310]  It's not a science fiction movie.
[01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.450]  It's 2005.
[01:39:35.467 --> 01:39:57.803]  And so then you won't have to be in harm's way, and you won't have to see all the killing you're doing, and you'll have all been properly trained on the video games designed by the Pentagon, where you're in office buildings in a nondescript area of the city, controlling attack drones on the ground, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 miles away.
[01:39:59.624 --> 01:40:02.646]  Everything's going to be toll roads and scanners and taxation.
[01:40:02.687 --> 01:40:03.287]  It's a nightmare.
[01:40:03.946 --> 01:40:05.226]  All right, let's go to the calls here.
[01:40:05.266 --> 01:40:05.867]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:05.907 --> 01:40:07.307]  Patrick in Maryland.
[01:40:07.327 --> 01:40:08.067]  Patrick, go ahead.
[01:40:08.668 --> 01:40:09.828]  Thank you for your program today.
[01:40:09.908 --> 01:40:10.708]  It's really interesting.
[01:40:10.948 --> 01:40:11.408]  Well, thank you.
[01:40:11.688 --> 01:40:14.109]  I haven't given a lot of thought to this over the last two years.
[01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:29.214]  In light of the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, the terrorist watch list, public school surveillance of students and enforced drugging, proposed driver's licenses, national ID card, news media's propaganda, the doctrine of preemptive war by the government, among other things,
[01:40:29.781 --> 01:40:35.324]  Would you say that we are, for all practical purposes, witnessing the noxification of American government, culture, and society?
[01:40:37.085 --> 01:40:38.866]  Well, yes, the tyranny.
[01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:43.048]  I mean, it's the same model, the same system, just with a high-tech overlay.
[01:40:44.009 --> 01:40:45.429]  I mean, it's the exact same pattern.
[01:40:45.449 --> 01:40:46.950]  It's the exact same script.
[01:40:47.631 --> 01:40:50.032]  You'd have to be an idiot not to see it.
[01:40:50.932 --> 01:40:55.875]  Well, that's what I was thinking, because there's some amazing parallels and similarities between the years
[01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:57.023]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:40:57.063 --> 01:40:58.824]  I mean, if you read mainstream, even the history books like...
[01:41:15.771 --> 01:41:17.832]  Well, did you know in the Washington Post today, the headline was this, U.S.
[01:41:18.392 --> 01:41:19.493]  will tighten passport rules.
[01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:21.093]  Canada and Mexico borders will be affected by 2008.
[01:41:21.133 --> 01:41:21.974]  In the first paragraph.
[01:41:44.468 --> 01:41:55.434]  Billions of Americans will be required to show passports when they re-enter the United States from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean Islands by 2008 under the new rules announced yesterday by the state Homeland Security Department.
[01:41:55.454 --> 01:41:56.214]  Yeah, good points.
[01:41:56.234 --> 01:41:57.015]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:57.335 --> 01:41:58.496]  This is how the spin works.
[01:41:58.556 --> 01:42:01.517]  They put Rice and Gonzalez up there.
[01:42:01.557 --> 01:42:05.039]  We need to expand the Patriot Act and reauthorize it because it sunsets.
[01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:09.261]  The key provisions, 213, 802, 215, they do not sunset.
[01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.042]  It's a lot.
[01:42:10.582 --> 01:42:13.964]  It's a mechanism to always expand it every few years.
[01:42:15.743 --> 01:42:18.604]  And then, oh, we're going to stop the illegal aliens now.
[01:42:18.624 --> 01:42:20.045]  We've just got to have some controls.
[01:42:20.745 --> 01:42:27.888]  What they don't tell you is they accept the consular matricula cards under the Pan-American Union and the Super NAFTA Highway that Rick Perry's now pushing for.
[01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:31.610]  They're already building the thing about six miles, seven miles from where I sit.
[01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:34.271]  The illegals will just pour across illegally.
[01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:37.633]  They're going to, quote, fix the illegal problem by just legalizing all of them.
[01:42:38.793 --> 01:42:40.554]  I mean, that's what Bush is doing.
[01:42:41.509 --> 01:42:44.352]  But then they tell you, but citizens will have to do it too now.
[01:42:44.912 --> 01:42:46.253]  That's going to be domestically.
[01:42:47.575 --> 01:42:49.696]  So it's a big problem.
[01:42:49.717 --> 01:42:50.077]  You're right.
[01:42:51.058 --> 01:42:53.320]  Phillip in Virginia.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.281]  Welcome, sir.
[01:42:55.281 --> 01:42:56.082]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:56.843 --> 01:42:59.986]  Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of crazy, isn't it?
[01:43:00.786 --> 01:43:07.192]  The American people have to put up with this all for the sake of protecting us against terrorism.
[01:43:08.033 --> 01:43:08.153]  But...
[01:43:09.201 --> 01:43:10.622]  I wanted to have a news flash here.
[01:43:10.942 --> 01:43:16.546]  The white supremacist Matthew Hale was sentenced to 40 years for soliciting the death of the federal judge.
[01:43:17.406 --> 01:43:26.512]  But it's okay for Bush and others to engage in the same behavior through programs like the Rewards for Justice.
[01:43:27.212 --> 01:43:28.493]  Boy, what a crock that is.
[01:43:28.813 --> 01:43:29.293]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:43:29.333 --> 01:43:34.857]  For those who don't know, about a dozen people every day are brought up on TV bleeding black eyes.
[01:43:37.296 --> 01:43:48.833]  Literally, a media that was up on a parapet and saw it, saw them with sandwich boards with what they're supposed to read and say, and it's, quote, fighting terrorism, terrorists in the hands of justice, and...
[01:43:49.853 --> 01:43:52.815]  The people will, I'm a terrorist, I robbed someone.
[01:43:52.835 --> 01:43:56.717]  See, now robbing is terrorism, and there's no juries, no nothing.
[01:43:56.737 --> 01:44:08.624]  You just have public confessions, and then people are hauled off, and then they've got a guy who admittedly bombed movie theaters and school buses, a lowly terrorist, running the country.
[01:44:09.284 --> 01:44:10.585]  Yeah, it's despicable.
[01:44:11.025 --> 01:44:13.687]  What do you think of that last guest talking about how we need this draft?
[01:44:14.327 --> 01:44:19.510]  Oh, he's totally brainwashed or just uninformed.
[01:44:20.974 --> 01:44:22.415]  I had a question for him.
[01:44:22.535 --> 01:44:34.320]  I was wondering if he was behind this imperial mobilization, because according to their own writings, that's what this is all about.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:40.363]  I wanted to quote him, one of my favorite people, General Smedley Butler.
[01:44:40.822 --> 01:44:43.844]  And he characterized his career as a racketeer for U.S.
[01:44:43.884 --> 01:44:46.766]  imperialism and capitalism in general.
[01:44:47.047 --> 01:45:01.417]  And the reason why our military is having a problem and the guys don't want to stay in and they don't want to go is because of a quote by Mr. Herman Goering that I printed off of your website.
[01:45:02.378 --> 01:45:05.340]  Why, of course, the people don't want war, but after all,
[01:45:05.836 --> 01:45:17.665]  It is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship.
[01:45:18.206 --> 01:45:22.369]  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
[01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:23.550]  That is easy.
[01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:32.397]  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country and that's what I wanted to read to your guests.
[01:45:33.587 --> 01:45:35.648]  Yeah, he said that during the Nuremberg trials.
[01:45:35.989 --> 01:45:36.309]  Yes.
[01:45:36.989 --> 01:45:40.392]  But I have four quick questions for you.
[01:45:40.512 --> 01:45:46.135]  Last hour, you had a little wish list of things, and one of them was about senators, and I didn't catch what you said about the senators.
[01:45:47.076 --> 01:45:59.985]  Well, until 1913, when they gave us the income tax with the 16th Amendment, the 17th Amendment, before, the senators were creatures of the states, because states were independent, and it was something that they weren't able to erase.
[01:46:00.769 --> 01:46:17.933]  After the Civil War, trying to get total federal dominance, but before 1913 and the 17th Amendment, this is very important, the legislatures which we elect, they would then vote and appoint the senators.
[01:46:18.593 --> 01:46:28.595]  And they would recall the senators, and they didn't do exactly what they were told to do by the legislatures, and that gave the states a trump over the federal government.
[01:46:29.472 --> 01:46:30.653]  And look now what's happened.
[01:46:30.673 --> 01:46:35.697]  We have an Imperial Senate, literally, that's what they call it, that just does whatever it wants.
[01:46:36.217 --> 01:46:37.338]  Okay, yeah, I see that.
[01:46:37.638 --> 01:46:41.121]  All right, you mentioned also earlier, you had a caller mention about George Norrie.
[01:46:41.441 --> 01:46:48.867]  Does the Austin station that you did coast-to-coast on with him also carry the syndicated government propaganda?
[01:46:50.428 --> 01:46:51.469]  Talking about Lord Limbaugh?
[01:46:52.130 --> 01:46:53.150]  Yeah, and Hannity.
[01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:54.672]  No, they don't carry Hannity.
[01:46:55.352 --> 01:46:56.433]  But they do carry Limbaugh.
[01:46:56.747 --> 01:46:57.047]  Yeah.
[01:46:57.267 --> 01:46:58.048]  Well, that was great.
[01:46:58.728 --> 01:47:04.050]  I was really happy that you got in there on enemy territory, so to speak.
[01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:07.251]  Our cause had a little coup on that day.
[01:47:08.372 --> 01:47:13.554]  Also, let me mention real quick, the whole world is wondering after the papal beast right now.
[01:47:14.514 --> 01:47:15.434]  Don't fall for it.
[01:47:15.474 --> 01:47:16.775]  Come out of her, my people.
[01:47:17.515 --> 01:47:21.757]  Do you know a fellow named Richard Hirschfeld?
[01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:24.270]  No, I don't.
[01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:28.172]  He was supposedly committed suicide back in January.
[01:47:29.152 --> 01:47:31.433]  And he was local here in Hampton Roads.
[01:47:32.133 --> 01:47:34.274]  And he had all kinds of connections.
[01:47:34.974 --> 01:47:38.055]  Nixon, both Bushes.
[01:47:39.216 --> 01:47:42.197]  He may have helped capture supposedly Saddam Hussein.
[01:47:42.637 --> 01:47:46.798]  But I just didn't know if you had any inside information about it.
[01:47:46.818 --> 01:47:47.639]  No, there's so much happening.
[01:47:47.659 --> 01:47:49.199]  But now I know about it because you told me.
[01:47:49.479 --> 01:47:49.719]  Yeah.
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:51.700]  Okay.
[01:47:52.423 --> 01:47:53.965]  Well I appreciate your call Phil.
[01:47:53.985 --> 01:47:54.626]  Good to hear from you.
[01:47:55.607 --> 01:47:56.628]  God bless you my friend.
[01:47:56.648 --> 01:47:59.791]  A lot of good points that man just brought up.
[01:47:59.851 --> 01:48:02.735]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:48:04.679 --> 01:48:07.781]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York.
[01:48:07.841 --> 01:48:08.501]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:48:08.521 --> 01:48:09.322]  Hello, Alex.
[01:48:09.622 --> 01:48:09.902]  Hello.
[01:48:09.962 --> 01:48:23.791]  I called up in reference to the new standards initiated by the State Department that will require American citizens to have passports when they try to re-enter the country from this hemisphere, most particularly Mexico and Canada.
[01:48:24.091 --> 01:48:25.594]  With RFID chips.
[01:48:25.614 --> 01:48:27.618]  Yes, and that's correct, with the new technology.
[01:48:28.139 --> 01:48:35.654]  And the most glaring omission in this new law in which they're claiming that it's designed to protect the United States.
[01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:51.734]  Is that as it concerns Mexicans coming into the United States, all they'll require is a very cheap, flimsy, ersatz piece of identification issued by their government, and the larger onus, weight, and responsibility will be on an American citizen to get back into his own country.
[01:48:52.154 --> 01:48:55.297]  Listen, when they put biometrics in in the States...
[01:48:56.537 --> 01:48:58.318]  The illegals, they don't have to do it.
[01:48:58.438 --> 01:49:00.178]  They're given a waiver.
[01:49:00.318 --> 01:49:02.959]  Particularly illegals from Mexico.
[01:49:03.379 --> 01:49:09.541]  In fact, the standards for Canadians, as though we're being swamped by illegal Canadians in this country, will also be very high.
[01:49:09.941 --> 01:49:15.722]  And yet the Bush administration has used its political rhetoric to sell this as though this thing is going to be applied equally.
[01:49:16.022 --> 01:49:18.783]  No, no, all people here are getting the top on immigration.
[01:49:18.803 --> 01:49:19.643]  Hey, good job, Bush.
[01:49:19.883 --> 01:49:22.044]  Meanwhile, he's with Fox going, I want amnesty.
[01:49:22.364 --> 01:49:25.966]  Getting tough on American citizens when they attempt to enter into their own country.
[01:49:25.986 --> 01:49:29.909]  In other words, the only one that's going to bear heavy weight is going to be the American citizen.
[01:49:30.269 --> 01:49:34.472]  The Mexican citizen will cross your borders more easily than you can cross your borders.
[01:49:34.672 --> 01:49:38.494]  And also, this indicates to me that everything eventually dovetails.
[01:49:38.514 --> 01:49:45.719]  This is a signal to me that they are going to start a draft because they want to keep control of American citizens in case they wind up... No, you're right.
[01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:46.339]  You're right.
[01:49:46.599 --> 01:49:49.581]  They signed a deal with Canada so people can't run to Canada.
[01:49:50.425 --> 01:49:51.186]  Absolutely right.
[01:49:51.206 --> 01:49:51.626]  We'll be back.
[01:49:51.666 --> 01:49:52.527]  More calls, more news.
[01:49:52.547 --> 01:49:52.948]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.809 --> 01:49:55.310]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:58.613]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.733 --> 01:50:02.657]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.697 --> 01:50:06.922]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.262 --> 01:50:11.046]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.126 --> 01:50:13.008]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:16.251 --> 01:50:21.236]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.396 --> 01:50:24.439]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:24.619 --> 01:50:27.482]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.963 --> 01:50:34.089]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.609 --> 01:50:36.452]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:53.251 --> 01:50:53.812]  We're good to go.

[01:53:13.631 --> 01:53:18.433]  We will continue with your calls in the next hour.
[01:53:18.994 --> 01:53:21.014]  Interesting article out of the Des Moines Register.
[01:53:21.034 --> 01:53:22.335]  It's six pages long.
[01:53:23.175 --> 01:53:26.256]  Des Moines Register, Gannon, is he Johnny Gosch?
[01:53:27.917 --> 01:53:36.160]  And they admit that blogs broke the news of Gannon being a fake reporter paid by the White House and being a male prostitute.
[01:53:37.532 --> 01:53:41.014]  And they kind of leave it open and say, is he Johnny Gosch?
[01:53:41.274 --> 01:53:58.942]  And it gets into the CIA, slave rings, and the rest of it, showing that the blogs, that is alternative media, on the Internet are now really, in many cases, forcing the mainstream media to respond.
[01:54:00.403 --> 01:54:03.344]  So we will get into that subject as well.
[01:54:04.165 --> 01:54:06.746]  As I said earlier, I've got a big stack
[01:54:08.169 --> 01:54:12.432]  Of articles here in front of me concerning toll roads.
[01:54:13.953 --> 01:54:22.819]  Here in Texas, they've got a bill right now to put a transponder in your car by law to tax you for every mile you drive.
[01:54:22.839 --> 01:54:24.581]  That's been their plan all along.
[01:54:25.601 --> 01:54:30.625]  And then listeners started emailing me local news articles in their area.
[01:54:31.997 --> 01:54:33.838]  Of the country where the exact same thing is happening.
[01:54:33.858 --> 01:54:34.319]  Listen to this.
[01:54:34.839 --> 01:54:37.021]  Additional proposed toll roads revealed.
[01:54:37.781 --> 01:54:39.262]  W-O-A-I San Antonio.
[01:54:39.282 --> 01:54:43.625]  They're going not only to Austin and Houston, but Bexar County is going to have a bunch of toll roads.
[01:54:44.306 --> 01:54:44.986]  Another headline.
[01:54:45.847 --> 01:54:46.927]  This is out of Lafayette.
[01:54:48.228 --> 01:54:51.050]  State considers emulating Texas road funding system.
[01:54:51.811 --> 01:54:53.572]  Making basically the whole state a toll road.
[01:54:55.191 --> 01:54:55.891]  Here's another one.
[01:54:55.951 --> 01:54:56.991]  Privatization of U.S.
[01:54:57.011 --> 01:55:03.133]  toll roads and other infrastructure gaining speed, says major groups studying this.
[01:55:04.553 --> 01:55:05.294]  New York Post.
[01:55:05.754 --> 01:55:07.274]  Driving New York to ruin.
[01:55:07.294 --> 01:55:09.075]  They're about to double the tolls again.
[01:55:09.835 --> 01:55:10.515]  Here's another one.
[01:55:10.695 --> 01:55:12.956]  Tech zaps tax cheats.
[01:55:13.076 --> 01:55:14.896]  Oh, wait till you hear this.
[01:55:14.916 --> 01:55:19.097]  I'm going to get into all that in detail in the next hour.
[01:55:19.117 --> 01:55:22.178]  I also want to get into the Johnny Gosch case.
[01:55:22.933 --> 01:55:25.835]  And this talk of trying to get Mel Gibson to run for president.
[01:55:26.195 --> 01:55:30.138]  Yeah, a lot better than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he's an American citizen who was born here!
[01:55:30.798 --> 01:55:40.565]  So, it would be good to have Mel run, and he'd beat out Schwarzenegger, hands down, which the globalists are trying to maneuver into the presidency.
[01:55:41.666 --> 01:55:44.828]  Before we end this hour, though, I want to implore the listeners...
[01:55:46.093 --> 01:55:47.273]  Please write this down.
[01:55:47.393 --> 01:55:48.974]  Please take action.
[01:55:49.014 --> 01:55:50.114]  This will have an effect.
[01:55:50.414 --> 01:55:51.594]  This is waking people up.
[01:55:51.634 --> 01:55:52.994]  It's one of the best tools we've got.
[01:55:53.474 --> 01:56:00.836]  The most powerful video I've ever made, my 12th film, is Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:56:01.356 --> 01:56:04.657]  And the DVD is now available, a little bit over three hours long.
[01:56:04.997 --> 01:56:07.137]  The VHS is two hours, 35 minutes.
[01:56:07.477 --> 01:56:08.937]  It's really three films in one.
[01:56:09.358 --> 01:56:11.358]  We cover the latest police state developments.
[01:56:12.017 --> 01:56:24.544]  We spend an hour on September 11th, like no other film does, detailing how the globalists carried it out, from NORAD stand-down to Building 7 to Dick Cheney in control of NORAD, to what the Bushes were doing on 9-11.
[01:56:24.844 --> 01:56:33.028]  And then we spend an hour on who the elite is, what makes them tick, their philosophy, their ideology, the Nazi connections, the occult connections.
[01:56:33.609 --> 01:56:34.749]  It's all documented.
[01:56:35.069 --> 01:56:38.111]  You've got to get martial law, 9-11, rise of the police state.
[01:56:38.931 --> 01:56:46.358]  The total free number to order the film, there's a bunch of other videos I offer, a bunch of other specials I'm offering, so be sure and ask about that when you call, is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:46.378 --> 01:56:46.598]  The film's $25.95.

[01:57:38.715 --> 01:57:40.876]  Third hour, 70 seconds away.
[01:57:41.316 --> 01:57:41.877]  Big Brother.
[01:57:41.917 --> 01:57:42.757]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.648 --> 01:57:55.929]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.649 --> 01:57:57.530]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.550 --> 01:58:01.871]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.391 --> 01:58:06.553]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.475 --> 01:58:15.716]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, 27 seconds into this third hour.
[01:58:16.676 --> 01:58:18.517]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:28.115]  It's not just Texas that's going to put the transponders in your cars that track you by the mile and tax you by the mile.
[01:58:29.036 --> 01:58:34.841]  It's going on all over the country, and I've got a big stack of news articles concerning it and just how serious it's going to get.
[01:58:35.762 --> 01:58:37.944]  As I mentioned earlier, the Des Moines Redisher.
[01:58:38.204 --> 01:58:41.467]  The question is, is Gannon kidnapped Johnny Gosch?
[01:58:42.708 --> 01:58:44.770]  Talk of Mel Gibson running for president.
[01:58:45.111 --> 01:58:45.851]  People wanting to.
[01:58:45.871 --> 01:58:47.573]  The Minuteman Project.
[01:58:51.056 --> 01:58:59.723]  They're stopping thousands of illegals pouring across and have basically forced the Border Patrol to arrest 141 that still try to sneak right past them.
[01:59:01.445 --> 01:59:05.268]  We'll be going over all of this in this hour and a lot more.
[01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:08.831]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:12.253]  Michael in North Carolina, then Bruce, J.R., Justin, Eric and others.
[01:59:12.313 --> 01:59:12.974]  Michael, welcome.
[01:59:13.889 --> 01:59:14.990]  Alex, thank you very much.
[01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:16.892]  It's good to be with you.
[01:59:16.952 --> 01:59:19.334]  Thank you for allowing me to stand here beside you today.
[01:59:19.714 --> 01:59:21.055]  Hey, I thank you for calling.
[01:59:21.095 --> 01:59:23.297]  Listen, I'm glad you care about freedom.
[01:59:23.718 --> 01:59:28.882]  Partner, I just want to respond to someone that called last week and said they were on hold for 30 minutes.
[01:59:29.483 --> 01:59:30.103]  You remember that?
[01:59:30.744 --> 01:59:31.024]  Yes.
[01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:34.467]  Partner, I've been on hold an hour and 42 minutes.
[01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:39.411]  It took me 40 minutes to get on the call line today.
[01:59:40.204 --> 01:59:41.445]  In line to talk to you.
[01:59:41.525 --> 01:59:44.648]  Praise God for the awakening taking place in this nation.
[01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.729]  Well, thank you.
[01:59:46.749 --> 01:59:49.891]  You know, I try to go to the calls as fast as I can, so thanks for holding.
[01:59:50.152 --> 01:59:52.033]  People are calling in, my friend.
[01:59:52.073 --> 01:59:52.954]  People are waking up.
[01:59:53.394 --> 01:59:54.215]  It's a good sign.
[01:59:54.895 --> 02:00:01.880]  I would like to read six sentences from an article two weeks old in the News and Observer newspaper.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:02.261]  Sure, sure.
[02:00:02.621 --> 02:00:08.225]  The title of this is, Home Inspections Worry Owners, House-to-House Checks Near Downtown Raleigh
[02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:10.670]  Lead some to think they'll be forced out.
[02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:13.713]  I'm sure you're aware of this, but the listeners may not be.
[02:00:16.194 --> 02:00:23.520]  Since 2003, the city has been engaged in mandatory housing code inspections for every home in aging neighborhoods near downtown.
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:30.545]  The effort visited on these older neighborhoods in or near downtown is called concentrated code enforcement.
[02:00:32.746 --> 02:00:34.968]  Residents call the sweep an invasion.
[02:00:35.666 --> 02:00:47.576]  Now city inspectors are knocking on doors in the downtown East community where most folks live in single-family homes a few blocks from the Fayetteville Street Mall and Progress Energy's new high-rise.
[02:00:48.677 --> 02:00:58.105]  Inspectors enter homes to look for violations such as deteriorating walls, leaky roofs, faulty wiring, malfunctioning smoke alarms.
[02:00:58.685 --> 02:01:04.510]  They're also checking outside the property for public nuisances such as trash and junk cars.
[02:01:05.262 --> 02:01:17.573]  Inspectors will work all of the city's redevelopment areas, underdeveloped or blighted communities where the city plans to acquire property or develop it.
[02:01:17.914 --> 02:01:21.797]  Now, this is a fishing expedition to force people out of their property.
[02:01:22.498 --> 02:01:23.859]  And it's going on all over the country.
[02:01:23.879 --> 02:01:25.100]  I'm so glad you brought this up.
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.943]  This is a whole other area of tyranny.
[02:01:28.963 --> 02:01:30.844]  That we face in this society today.
[02:01:31.265 --> 02:01:34.386]  Alex, it's been going on for 18 months and it's got 18 months left.
[02:01:34.406 --> 02:01:40.470]  They've got a map here showing phases, step by step, where they're going through these neighborhoods.
[02:01:42.151 --> 02:01:45.013]  Basically, the city is confiscating these people's property.
[02:01:45.333 --> 02:01:47.634]  Would you like this sent to you?
[02:01:47.975 --> 02:01:49.015]  Are you able to email it?
[02:01:49.696 --> 02:01:51.877]  No, I'm not, but I'd be more than happy to mail it.
[02:01:52.237 --> 02:01:53.558]  Mail it to me, absolutely.
[02:01:53.858 --> 02:01:56.520]  It's such an important point you raise.
[02:01:57.677 --> 02:02:00.919]  This is happening all over the nation, and I'll comment on it when we get back.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:02.400]  Anything else, Michael?
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:09.825]  Yes, I'd like to implore the listeners to pray for you daily and to support your sponsors.
[02:02:10.305 --> 02:02:10.846]  God bless.
[02:02:11.246 --> 02:02:11.986]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:02:12.026 --> 02:02:13.707]  Yeah, the support is needed.
[02:02:13.727 --> 02:02:19.411]  We can do so much more with people's support, and the broadcast is growing, but not fast enough.
[02:02:19.551 --> 02:02:22.073]  And thank you for that positive, uplifting information.
[02:02:22.113 --> 02:02:25.395]  Also, the sad information of what's happening with code inspection...
[02:02:26.371 --> 02:02:28.173]  Let's talk about that for a few minutes when we get back.
[02:02:28.193 --> 02:02:30.435]  Then I'll go to Bruce and J.R.
[02:02:30.455 --> 02:02:32.457]  and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[02:02:32.477 --> 02:02:35.421]  800-259-9231 and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are just two of the websites.
[02:02:35.441 --> 02:02:35.861]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.783 --> 02:02:50.128]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.308 --> 02:02:54.754]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.894 --> 02:02:59.259]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.299 --> 02:03:00.660]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.442 --> 02:03:06.664]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.724 --> 02:03:13.668]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.768 --> 02:03:15.869]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:17.150]  Homeland Security.
[02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:18.131]  Executive orders.
[02:03:18.311 --> 02:03:18.811]  Force vaccine.
[02:03:19.031 --> 02:03:26.597]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.777 --> 02:03:32.181]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:03:32.662 --> 02:03:35.304]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:03:35.404 --> 02:03:36.585]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:37.145 --> 02:03:38.886]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:46.127 --> 02:03:55.192]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.432 --> 02:04:06.679]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.999 --> 02:04:11.822]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[02:04:12.022 --> 02:04:12.502]  We're good to go.
[02:04:39.857 --> 02:04:43.299]  803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:51.083]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oregano, Oregomax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[02:04:51.443 --> 02:05:01.529]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, and particularly the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:03.710]  With a 100% kill.
[02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:08.852]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural Urban Spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[02:05:13.535 --> 02:05:22.319]  The oils, juices, and capsules manufactured by North American Urban Spice are from the finest raw materials in the world, which is why North American Urban Spice is recognized as the leader in natural herbal products.
[02:05:22.759 --> 02:05:27.622]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.
[02:05:28.482 --> 02:05:29.863]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:30.624 --> 02:05:35.447]  That's 877-817-9829 and start down the road to herbal health.
[02:05:35.787 --> 02:05:37.448]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs.
[02:05:37.548 --> 02:05:38.309]  The choice is yours.
[02:05:38.569 --> 02:05:43.472]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American herb and spice products today.
[02:05:46.574 --> 02:05:48.776]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.336 --> 02:05:53.519]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.719 --> 02:05:55.200]  All right, into hour number three.
[02:05:59.065 --> 02:06:01.726]  A man's home is his castle.
[02:06:04.067 --> 02:06:21.393]  I guess you could say a woman's home is her palace, but a caller in the last segment, in case you missed the call, was bringing up Raleigh, North Carolina, and I was aware that this was going on there in other areas around the country, where home inspectors come to homes that you own.
[02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:25.211]  And it can be poor neighborhoods, rich neighborhoods.
[02:06:25.231 --> 02:06:30.174]  They usually start in the poor neighborhoods to kind of legitimize what they're doing, thinking that poor, uneducated people want other rights.
[02:06:32.335 --> 02:06:33.435]  Yeah, you've got to let me in.
[02:06:33.475 --> 02:06:37.898]  I'm going to do a home inspection of your house to make sure it's secure and everything's in proper order.
[02:06:39.899 --> 02:06:43.881]  And they normally do this in areas they want to condemn, areas they want to expand shopping malls.
[02:06:44.021 --> 02:06:48.563]  And, of course, in the article the caller was just reading, it admits that they want the homes, they want to bulldoze them.
[02:06:49.511 --> 02:06:56.093]  So here I am, from the government, openly wanting to get your property and steal it from you and look for ways to fine and fee you to get it.
[02:06:57.233 --> 02:06:57.673]  Let me in.
[02:06:57.693 --> 02:06:59.634]  Well, you have to have a warrant to do that.
[02:07:00.774 --> 02:07:01.314]  No, I don't.
[02:07:01.574 --> 02:07:02.054]  No, I don't.
[02:07:02.114 --> 02:07:03.375]  It's a local regulation.
[02:07:03.935 --> 02:07:07.116]  Well, the Bill of Rights trumps your regulation.
[02:07:07.136 --> 02:07:14.017]  Your little regulation that came out of some bureaucrat's brain doesn't trump this country or what America's all about.
[02:07:14.357 --> 02:07:16.378]  But listen, they've got places in Illinois...
[02:07:17.785 --> 02:07:21.709]  Where they do unannounced home inspections of homes that people own, not even government housing.
[02:07:21.989 --> 02:07:23.530]  You know, Clinton started this with government housing.
[02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:29.515]  Well, you don't have any rights to a Fourth Amendment, and we're going to do weapon sweeps of any government housing.
[02:07:31.737 --> 02:07:32.318]  Well, that's not true.
[02:07:32.338 --> 02:07:34.420]  People still have their rights, but they said you didn't.
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:41.266]  Well, in Illinois, and we've gone over this many times on the broadcast in a bunch of different cities, people wake up at 6 a.m.
[02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:44.869]  with men in black masks with guns doing a home inspection.
[02:07:45.945 --> 02:07:48.207]  And these aren't homes where somebody refused to let them in.
[02:07:49.768 --> 02:07:55.371]  They admit it's a fishing expedition, and the old lady wakes up, and let's say the house is zoned to have two people in it.
[02:07:56.232 --> 02:07:59.794]  If they find a third toothbrush, automatic $1,000 fine.
[02:08:00.134 --> 02:08:01.895]  Oh, this shows you've got someone else here.
[02:08:02.055 --> 02:08:09.120]  Or neighbors get bonus cash if you've got family over for a week, and your house is zoned for four people, but why, there's eight people there.
[02:08:12.091 --> 02:08:14.072]  Or if they don't even knock, they just come in.
[02:08:14.092 --> 02:08:21.134]  In fact, in several news articles out of Illinois, mainstream news they were describing, and the articles were like, this was normal and good, by the way.
[02:08:22.635 --> 02:08:24.195]  People said, well, you're using mainstream media.
[02:08:24.215 --> 02:08:26.256]  Yeah, they're spinning it and saying it's good.
[02:08:26.716 --> 02:08:27.516]  We say it's wrong.
[02:08:28.037 --> 02:08:33.198]  And people are eating breakfast, and then just men walk in, and you go, excuse me, what are you doing, police?
[02:08:33.939 --> 02:08:35.379]  Quiet, we're doing a home inspection.
[02:08:35.419 --> 02:08:37.000]  Or in some cases, they don't even say why they're there.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.241]  Then if you complain, they just turn to you and taser you.
[02:08:42.102 --> 02:08:43.682]  You were interfering with police business.
[02:08:46.163 --> 02:08:49.444]  And, I mean, look, folks, it's like the census.
[02:08:49.484 --> 02:08:50.805]  They came to my door in 2000.
[02:08:51.505 --> 02:08:52.585]  You didn't fill out your form.
[02:08:52.645 --> 02:08:55.406]  I go, well, you gave me 56 questions.
[02:08:56.146 --> 02:09:05.109]  Under the Constitution, I've only got to tell you how many people live here for congressional apportionment to decide how many members of Congress my state gets.
[02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:09.792]  Some states, as they lose population, get less members.
[02:09:10.152 --> 02:09:14.755]  States like Texas, California that are growing, Florida, every 10 years we get more members of Congress.
[02:09:15.415 --> 02:09:19.078]  That's all that Exodus says we're supposed to do.
[02:09:20.338 --> 02:09:23.560]  That's all that the Magna Carta says.
[02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:27.082]  That's all that the Constitution says, is how many people live here?
[02:09:27.403 --> 02:09:29.464]  That's the only question you can ask.
[02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:32.670]  Not, do you own firearms?
[02:09:32.710 --> 02:09:34.250]  Do you have a low-flush toilet?
[02:09:34.530 --> 02:09:36.091]  How much money do you have in the bank account?
[02:09:36.331 --> 02:09:37.131]  Do you have a renter?
[02:09:37.171 --> 02:09:38.012]  Did they pay cash?
[02:09:38.392 --> 02:09:39.632]  Where did they live last time?
[02:09:39.852 --> 02:09:41.013]  These are the questions I was given.
[02:09:41.573 --> 02:09:42.673]  One out of six homes got it.
[02:09:43.254 --> 02:09:44.874]  Now they're saying they're going to have a yearly census.
[02:09:45.655 --> 02:09:51.577]  And I told the zit-faced kid at my door with his little plastic badge, I said, I don't have to answer your questions.
[02:09:52.077 --> 02:09:52.717]  I closed the door.
[02:09:52.797 --> 02:09:53.418]  He knocked again.
[02:09:53.438 --> 02:09:56.159]  He said, hey, you've got to answer my question.
[02:09:56.339 --> 02:09:57.019]  You'll get in trouble.
[02:09:57.924 --> 02:09:59.745]  And I said, buddy, I got a Fifth Amendment.
[02:09:59.845 --> 02:10:01.766]  I wouldn't have to tell you anything if I was a criminal.
[02:10:02.046 --> 02:10:02.846]  Now, get out of here.
[02:10:02.866 --> 02:10:03.806]  He came back a few days later.
[02:10:04.086 --> 02:10:06.507]  I stuck a video camera in his face, and he ran off.
[02:10:08.048 --> 02:10:10.349]  And the punk was parked in the middle of the street.
[02:10:10.429 --> 02:10:11.429]  Talk about a lunatic.
[02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:16.732]  And we had cases of him busting in people's houses, pushing through doors.
[02:10:18.852 --> 02:10:20.173]  This is government.
[02:10:20.373 --> 02:10:21.573]  This is what they think.
[02:10:23.014 --> 02:10:25.235]  And then now they have a thing where, uh-oh, well...
[02:10:26.428 --> 02:10:31.572]  We're going to force every man in the town to give a DNA test, because you want to catch the killer, don't you?
[02:10:33.233 --> 02:10:43.720]  Or, oh, we're going to do... They did some law in Louisiana, which the Fifth Circuit said they could do, which is totally unconstitutional, last year.
[02:10:45.742 --> 02:10:46.983]  And they actually said...
[02:10:48.965 --> 02:10:55.847]  That, well, if the police just don't like how something looks, not even probable cause, they can demand an inspection of your home and handcuff you while they're at it.
[02:10:55.887 --> 02:10:59.629]  And the headline in the newspaper was, no more warrants, no more Fourth Amendment.
[02:10:59.889 --> 02:11:01.789]  Well, you can claim there's no Fourth Amendment.
[02:11:02.010 --> 02:11:02.990]  It's still there!
[02:11:05.211 --> 02:11:07.471]  Again, I use this analogy too much, but it's the best one.
[02:11:07.952 --> 02:11:10.192]  We've had federal courts say black people aren't human beings.
[02:11:10.232 --> 02:11:11.393]  Does that mean it's true?
[02:11:11.773 --> 02:11:12.073]  No.
[02:11:13.313 --> 02:11:14.514]  We've had courts say that...
[02:11:17.003 --> 02:11:19.365]  You know, that people could be indentured servants and slaves.
[02:11:19.525 --> 02:11:20.366]  Does it mean it's true?
[02:11:20.466 --> 02:11:20.726]  No.
[02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:22.627]  Courts aren't God.
[02:11:24.389 --> 02:11:28.231]  Courts can say that they can have a draft and make you go charge machine gun nests.
[02:11:28.792 --> 02:11:29.973]  That's not the case.
[02:11:30.013 --> 02:11:31.074]  That's illegal, folks.
[02:11:31.114 --> 02:11:32.254]  That's indentured servitude.
[02:11:32.655 --> 02:11:33.435]  That's slavery.
[02:11:36.838 --> 02:11:39.400]  So government can declare itself God.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:40.341]  It's not God.
[02:11:42.542 --> 02:11:44.243]  And I tell you what, we'll go to J.R.
[02:11:44.304 --> 02:11:46.125]  and Justin and Eric and
[02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:53.634]  Everybody else that's Robert and Willie and everybody else that's holding here in a minute, but I want to talk about this.
[02:11:54.214 --> 02:11:55.115]  This is very important.
[02:11:56.837 --> 02:11:57.617]  Listen to me.
[02:11:57.677 --> 02:11:58.598]  This is fact.
[02:11:59.218 --> 02:12:01.100]  This is the official federal plans.
[02:12:02.141 --> 02:12:04.483]  I've been warning you about it for eight years.
[02:12:06.244 --> 02:12:12.149]  They're going to put transponders in all our cars, in some cases even worse, satellite tracker boxes.
[02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:15.032]  You'll have to pay for them when you get your tags.
[02:12:15.533 --> 02:12:19.679]  All the new cars for the last six, seven years have plug-ins for the satellite tracker box.
[02:12:19.699 --> 02:12:20.460]  We're leaving longer.
[02:12:22.423 --> 02:12:28.111]  They're going to put them in, and every major state, federal, and local road is going to charge you thousands of dollars a year to drive.
[02:12:28.151 --> 02:12:29.613]  Your car will become a taxi cab.
[02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:34.212]  The federal boards have called for it.
[02:12:34.432 --> 02:12:35.132]  It's been done.
[02:12:35.232 --> 02:12:39.696]  Now they're passing the laws at the state level and trying to pass them all over the country.
[02:12:39.736 --> 02:12:41.077]  In Texas, it's been introduced.
[02:12:41.637 --> 02:12:43.579]  And the bill, I could spend all day on this bill.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:48.302]  It's posted in yesterday's top stories on Infowars.com.
[02:12:50.184 --> 02:12:56.609]  The bill gives total control over the insurance, gives total control over tracking, databases,
[02:12:58.021 --> 02:12:59.462]  It just changes so much.
[02:12:59.602 --> 02:13:02.502]  But in there, of course, the headline is it's to make sure you have insurance.
[02:13:02.903 --> 02:13:07.404]  The insurance companies automatically report to a database the day your insurance expires.
[02:13:08.924 --> 02:13:12.605]  As you drive, these radio readers have already been put up all over state and federal roads.
[02:13:13.806 --> 02:13:14.986]  Now they're putting them up in city roads.
[02:13:15.006 --> 02:13:18.147]  See, they put it up even before they pass it, because they know they're going to pass it.
[02:13:20.027 --> 02:13:21.168]  That's the arrogance, people.
[02:13:22.148 --> 02:13:25.929]  Instantly scan you, and police are immediately dispatched the second...
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:28.181]  Your insurance expires.
[02:13:28.461 --> 02:13:29.302]  The second.
[02:13:31.243 --> 02:13:32.124]  Now, here's the bill.
[02:13:32.144 --> 02:13:33.005]  It says that.
[02:13:35.527 --> 02:13:36.648]  Your insurance expires.
[02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:37.008]  Boom.
[02:13:37.508 --> 02:13:40.771]  But as I said, they'd always put a transponder in there for some other reason.
[02:13:42.172 --> 02:13:48.377]  Now, they admit in the bill, in one of the subsections, oh, it's for toll roads and taxation purposes.
[02:13:50.838 --> 02:13:53.921]  It must be readable with the ID number in the state databanks.
[02:13:54.642 --> 02:14:00.923]  And of course the insurance companies are all pushing this and behind it because they own the government, they own the media, they are the global banks.
[02:14:02.403 --> 02:14:04.684]  It's like one more organ of the New World Order.
[02:14:06.884 --> 02:14:17.546]  Well, since we posted this on InfoWars.com, here is the WOAI-TV additional proposed toll roads revealed.
[02:14:18.426 --> 02:14:21.367]  The future is going to take its toll on San Antonio literally.
[02:14:22.125 --> 02:14:25.846]  Bayer County Commissioners have signed off on an ambitious multi-year plan.
[02:14:26.186 --> 02:14:27.966]  I have the official federal plans of the state.
[02:14:28.626 --> 02:14:34.608]  Every major road, I mean every major thoroughfare, you're going to have toll roads, okay?
[02:14:34.628 --> 02:14:43.910]  It's like first they toll Austin 9, then 14, then 21, and oh, by the way, 6,000 miles of toll roads in Texas.
[02:14:43.930 --> 02:14:44.970]  The entire nation has 7,000, okay?
[02:14:46.423 --> 02:14:47.825]  Rick Perry says, no, no, no, no, only 4,000.
[02:14:48.605 --> 02:14:50.928]  We have the text doc plan written by the feds.
[02:14:51.208 --> 02:14:52.549]  It is 6,000 miles!
[02:14:52.690 --> 02:14:54.912]  But he told you yesterday, 4,000.
[02:14:54.972 --> 02:14:58.135]  Do you have any idea how many 4,000 miles is?
[02:14:59.276 --> 02:15:01.899]  And it's to fund the Texas Corridor.
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:07.425]  They're going to use that money to build the supermassive NAFTA highway that they've already...
[02:15:08.192 --> 02:15:09.893]  Expanded to 15 lanes.
[02:15:09.973 --> 02:15:10.733]  It's not even open.
[02:15:11.013 --> 02:15:13.794]  The average person doesn't even know it exists, even though it was in Time Magazine.
[02:15:14.074 --> 02:15:17.235]  The gigantic highway is about 7 miles from where I sit.
[02:15:17.516 --> 02:15:18.796]  It is so huge!
[02:15:23.238 --> 02:15:24.038]  I'm ranting, aren't I?
[02:15:28.241 --> 02:15:36.829]  Bear County Commissioners have signed off on an ambitious multi-year plan to build 90 miles of new toll roads, toll lanes, and toll intersections across the county.
[02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:43.455]  In addition to already announced, see there's a bunch of others, I remember about five years ago they had those radio readers already up.
[02:15:44.554 --> 02:15:45.074]  Tag readers.
[02:15:45.434 --> 02:16:03.537]  In addition to already announced plans to build toll lanes along Loop 1604 across the north side to long-range plans to adding toll lanes, it's not toll lanes, it's the whole road, to Interstate 10 from 1604 to Loop 410 on the northwest side along Interstate 35 from 1604 to downtown.
[02:16:04.058 --> 02:16:11.899]  The Alamo Regional Mobility Authority will seek initial funding from the Texas Department of Transportation tomorrow to begin the long process of building the first toll road.
[02:16:12.924 --> 02:16:13.864]  And it goes on and on.
[02:16:14.044 --> 02:16:18.166]  Tolls allow us to construct to five years, but otherwise it would have taken 15 to 20.
[02:16:18.846 --> 02:16:21.428]  But they're putting them on existing roads, but nothing compared to Austin.
[02:16:23.388 --> 02:16:26.149]  And here's one out of the Advocate newspaper.
[02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:32.532]  State considers emulating Texas road funding projects to focus on urban areas.
[02:16:33.072 --> 02:16:38.114]  State legislators are working to copy a system funding toll roads that raise $6 billion in Texas.
[02:16:38.915 --> 02:16:39.515]  It has raised.
[02:16:39.555 --> 02:16:40.475]  They haven't even built it yet.
[02:16:40.855 --> 02:16:42.016]  See how they sell this stuff?
[02:16:42.719 --> 02:16:45.901]  Though they have not decided where to find the increased revenue.
[02:16:46.681 --> 02:16:52.725]  The review would be used matching funds from urban area toll roads such as the proposed Lafayette Metropolitan Express.
[02:16:53.185 --> 02:16:53.706]  It goes on.
[02:16:53.746 --> 02:16:54.366]  Here's another one.
[02:16:55.246 --> 02:16:56.647]  I've got a stack of these.
[02:16:57.508 --> 02:17:00.750]  The scariest articles I'm going to read when we get back and we'll go to your calls.
[02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:02.691]  Because I want you to know how these work.
[02:17:02.731 --> 02:17:03.551]  Listen to this headline.
[02:17:04.452 --> 02:17:06.613]  Tech zaps tax cheats.
[02:17:07.053 --> 02:17:07.514]  Oh, see.
[02:17:08.494 --> 02:17:08.915]  You see...
[02:17:10.424 --> 02:17:11.845]  It's not just going to be insurance.
[02:17:12.405 --> 02:17:14.386]  You didn't pay a $35 parking ticket.
[02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:22.930]  We instantly, this is in the article, they pull you over and tow your car and demand $300.
[02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:30.354]  Oh, see?
[02:17:32.014 --> 02:17:37.417]  The minute you speed, the minute you do something wrong, instantly ticketed everywhere.
[02:17:37.955 --> 02:17:38.675]  Total control!
[02:17:39.076 --> 02:17:39.916]  Hope you enjoy it.
[02:17:40.356 --> 02:17:41.057]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.379 --> 02:17:52.763]  To the farthest corners of the Earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:53.083 --> 02:17:55.424]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.644 --> 02:17:57.185]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:57.565 --> 02:18:02.648]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:58.534]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:19:46.015 --> 02:19:48.455]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[02:19:49.215 --> 02:19:54.837]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:19:54.877 --> 02:19:55.657]  Supreme Court.
[02:19:56.397 --> 02:20:00.718]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:20:00.738 --> 02:20:04.279]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:20:05.328 --> 02:20:05.588]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:31.918 --> 02:20:33.580]  516-8736.
[02:20:34.502 --> 02:20:35.924]  Call now.
[02:20:36.064 --> 02:20:42.635]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:47.812]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:20:48.092 --> 02:20:51.916]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:20:52.236 --> 02:20:53.057]  Read the labels.
[02:20:53.477 --> 02:20:57.621]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:57.821 --> 02:21:02.024]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:02.405 --> 02:21:07.269]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:07.649 --> 02:21:11.231]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:21:11.411 --> 02:21:16.754]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:21:17.034 --> 02:21:19.755]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[02:21:50.187 --> 02:21:57.248]  Now, this is what the feds and the states say they're going to do with these transponders and these cameras that read your license plates.
[02:21:57.288 --> 02:21:59.769]  They say they're going to tax you, they're going to trace you,
[02:22:00.498 --> 02:22:08.321]  They're going to read with the radio readers how fast you're driving point-to-point that a camera automatically photographs your car and sends you a ticket.
[02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:12.722]  And these companies are all Lockheed, Martin, Marietta, and others.
[02:22:13.222 --> 02:22:17.523]  And there's no judges, no juries, no... It's all just... This is privatization.
[02:22:18.184 --> 02:22:19.764]  The corporation's becoming government.
[02:22:22.305 --> 02:22:28.407]  TechZaps Tax Cheats, WFMY-TV, out of New Haven, Connecticut.
[02:22:29.076 --> 02:22:34.479]  A few weeks ago, New Haven resident Kara Norman found her son's car being towed from outside her Connecticut home.
[02:22:34.959 --> 02:22:36.020]  The reason stunned her.
[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:39.881]  It turns out she owed $37 in back taxes.
[02:22:39.922 --> 02:22:40.122]  See?
[02:22:40.402 --> 02:22:40.122]  $37.
[02:22:41.642 --> 02:22:42.383]  I was furious.
[02:22:42.463 --> 02:22:44.444]  I'm going, what are you towing it for?
[02:22:45.024 --> 02:22:46.865]  And he said, well, you owe back taxes.
[02:22:46.885 --> 02:22:58.651]  A CBS News correspondent, Bailey Assurus, reports in a small but growing number of cities, vehicle tax and parking ticket deadbeats, deadbeats now.
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:03.401]  Are being nailed by the tax man's new high-tech tool.
[02:23:05.662 --> 02:23:08.083]  But nobody gets in trouble for stealing trillions from the Pentagon.
[02:23:08.883 --> 02:23:12.885]  We like it, says Moses Cortez of the Arlington Treasurer's Office in Virginia.
[02:23:13.285 --> 02:23:14.825]  It makes our job a lot easier.
[02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:19.487]  It looks like a radar gun, but it's actually an infrared scanner that reads license plate numbers.
[02:23:20.007 --> 02:23:21.908]  Again, in L.A., they've already put these on the police cars.
[02:23:22.654 --> 02:23:25.895]  And then runs them against a computer database of tax and ticket delinquents.
[02:23:26.255 --> 02:23:28.016]  If there's a match, it locks in.
[02:23:28.476 --> 02:23:31.157]  It will read hundreds of plates in a few minutes, says Cortez.
[02:23:32.158 --> 02:23:35.859]  On a recent outing through the streets of Arlington, it took several minutes to hit pay dirt.
[02:23:36.219 --> 02:23:40.781]  The car was stripped of its plates, booted and towed until the owner pays up.
[02:23:41.541 --> 02:23:42.662]  And that's hundreds of dollars.
[02:23:43.482 --> 02:23:44.543]  Oh man, this is sick.
[02:23:44.723 --> 02:23:45.463]  This is so sick.
[02:23:46.645 --> 02:23:52.230]  Back in New Haven, which scored about $600,000 in just six months, people are lining up to pay their bills to avoid getting caught.
[02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:55.293]  Lawyer Arthur Machito wants the program shut down.
[02:23:55.673 --> 02:23:57.715]  You can't even go to Walmart without worrying about being towed.
[02:23:58.356 --> 02:24:03.620]  The corrupt mafia-owned tow companies are having a love fest with us.
[02:24:04.541 --> 02:24:07.444]  But they're talking about doing this with the cameras on the street corners.
[02:24:07.464 --> 02:24:08.985]  They've got Florida towns that do this.
[02:24:09.486 --> 02:24:10.747]  You've got unpaid tickets!
[02:24:11.619 --> 02:24:12.200]  How'd you know?
[02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:17.324]  Well, the camera, when you drove through town, every person who drives through town gets scanned.
[02:24:17.344 --> 02:24:21.507]  I'll go to your calls in a minute, but I've got to cover this other one.
[02:24:22.107 --> 02:24:23.628]  I've only got about ten more of these.
[02:24:23.689 --> 02:24:24.609]  I can't cover them all.
[02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:28.012]  New York Post driving New York to ruin.
[02:24:28.913 --> 02:24:33.076]  New York officials just won't rest until they force every last business out of the state.
[02:24:33.116 --> 02:24:36.939]  That's what New Yorkers, and particularly businesses and individuals who use the thoroughway...
[02:24:38.047 --> 02:24:42.471]  Must be thinking this week as a plan to hike tolls on a road is debated across the state.
[02:24:42.932 --> 02:24:46.214]  Tolls would rise about 25% for cars and an average of 35% for trucks.
[02:24:46.815 --> 02:24:48.677]  It's only seven bucks now, seven and a half bucks.
[02:24:49.037 --> 02:24:58.886]  Thanks to a simultaneous toll simplification plan, some truckers could face effective hikes of 100% or more, says William Joyce, president of the State Motor Truck Association.
[02:25:00.087 --> 02:25:02.049]  The marginal players are going to get knocked out.
[02:25:02.129 --> 02:25:02.849]  That's the plan.
[02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:04.391]  The big corporations can pass it on.
[02:25:05.705 --> 02:25:09.686]  Joyce warns, and we don't have a healthy industry in New York to start with.
[02:25:10.006 --> 02:25:11.487]  That's just the start of the pain.
[02:25:11.827 --> 02:25:15.108]  These are all just mafia rackets, folks.
[02:25:15.128 --> 02:25:15.808]  That's all this is.
[02:25:16.348 --> 02:25:22.850]  Joyce estimates the hikes could add as much as $6 an hour to the cost of shipping, where the money will come from.
[02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:24.611]  As much as $6 on top of this.
[02:25:24.971 --> 02:25:26.031]  Folks, I've been to these tolls.
[02:25:26.051 --> 02:25:26.031]  $4, $7.50.
[02:25:29.165 --> 02:25:31.867]  That's just... I've been to New York several times.
[02:25:32.788 --> 02:25:34.229]  I was there a few years ago, and it was like $5.
[02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.671]  Now it's like $7.
[02:25:36.752 --> 02:25:38.513]  Stuff that was $2 is $4.50.
[02:25:40.835 --> 02:25:44.178]  And some people will pay as much as 100% more.
[02:25:44.378 --> 02:25:46.019]  Gosh, will it be $15?
[02:25:48.561 --> 02:25:49.702]  You don't like it, Matt?
[02:25:49.722 --> 02:25:50.964]  Just shut up!
[02:25:52.145 --> 02:25:55.908]  You know how much a cabbie has to pay for a medallion on his... the tax on his...
[02:25:57.390 --> 02:26:02.593]  On his taxi cab, 100,000 bagoombas.
[02:26:03.414 --> 02:26:04.935]  100,000 smackers.
[02:26:05.775 --> 02:26:06.476]  100,000 clams.
[02:26:06.956 --> 02:26:07.557]  Shekels.
[02:26:08.197 --> 02:26:09.318]  Dollars, that is.
[02:26:09.418 --> 02:26:10.178]  Greenbacks.
[02:26:11.579 --> 02:26:12.940]  100 grand!
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.582]  Folks, they know you've got to use your car.
[02:26:15.602 --> 02:26:17.543]  They know the society's built around cars.
[02:26:17.803 --> 02:26:19.824]  They know we're living in a sprawling society.
[02:26:20.585 --> 02:26:21.866]  And they're going to rape us!
[02:26:22.646 --> 02:26:29.933]  And you can't vote them out because the electronic no-record CIA-controlled machines went in.
[02:26:29.954 --> 02:26:39.023]  And that's why suddenly government's so arrogant and says, we don't care if 98% of you are against the toll roads going in everywhere in Texas.
[02:26:39.443 --> 02:26:40.444]  We're going to do it.
[02:26:42.006 --> 02:26:44.248]  We've built prisons for you in case you don't like it.
[02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:47.671]  And we've militarized the police and taught them that you're the enemy.
[02:26:48.852 --> 02:26:51.593]  And we're trying your kids how to be prisoners in the schools right now.
[02:26:51.614 --> 02:26:54.315]  And you think it's bad now, scum.
[02:26:54.335 --> 02:26:56.257]  It's gonna get a lot worse.
[02:26:56.557 --> 02:26:58.178]  You belong to us now.
[02:26:58.538 --> 02:26:59.919]  And we're gonna take your guns.
[02:27:00.199 --> 02:27:01.861]  And we're gonna get rid of your borders.
[02:27:02.121 --> 02:27:04.262]  And we're gonna put your kids on drugs.
[02:27:06.324 --> 02:27:08.625]  We're the New World Order!
[02:27:08.965 --> 02:27:11.067]  We're criminals, idiots!
[02:27:12.007 --> 02:27:13.909]  And you belong to us now!
[02:27:15.091 --> 02:27:17.252]  So learn to submit to us!
[02:27:18.212 --> 02:27:20.613]  Learn to love the New World Order!
[02:27:21.134 --> 02:27:23.915]  Don't listen to those extremists that warn you!
[02:27:24.315 --> 02:27:34.019]  Just watch your federally produced newscast and get ready for the National Draft as we put your children in the meat grinder of World War IV!
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.240]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.681 --> 02:27:39.321]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.341 --> 02:27:42.903]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.774 --> 02:27:51.301]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[02:27:51.501 --> 02:27:59.070]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Panex 2000 to the public.
[02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:03.495]  The Panex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle.
[02:28:03.575 --> 02:28:05.758]  And the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[02:28:05.979 --> 02:28:07.340]  Now it's available to you.
[02:28:07.521 --> 02:28:14.130]  The PainX 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[02:28:14.331 --> 02:28:18.557]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diode therapy.
[02:28:18.897 --> 02:28:25.162]  Using five different wavelengths in the Panax 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[02:28:25.302 --> 02:28:29.366]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Panax 2000 device for everyone.

[02:28:49.516 --> 02:28:50.017]  are located?

[02:29:46.073 --> 02:29:51.595]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:51.735 --> 02:29:52.816]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:29:52.916 --> 02:29:53.796]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:53.916 --> 02:29:56.757]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:56.937 --> 02:30:01.819]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:03.160]  Check out this new product.
[02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:06.221]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:30:06.561 --> 02:30:10.243]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:30:10.783 --> 02:30:13.066]  The creator of No Bio understands what you're going through.
[02:30:13.186 --> 02:30:18.012]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:30:18.292 --> 02:30:21.415]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.

[02:30:52.102 --> 02:30:58.247]  You know, that little voiceover I did in the last segment, I mean, that's really the mindset, the spirit of the New World Order.
[02:30:59.748 --> 02:31:01.390]  That's how they see you.
[02:31:03.286 --> 02:31:07.008]  The last vestiges of the Republic will now be swept away.
[02:31:07.348 --> 02:31:11.289]  We will enslave them and drive them all into bankruptcy and submission.
[02:31:11.649 --> 02:31:16.031]  We will then put them on the corporate welfare system and they will be our slaves.
[02:31:16.291 --> 02:31:25.295]  And the stupid fools will never figure out who we really are or how we're carrying out terrorist attacks to make them beg us to enslave them.
[02:31:29.378 --> 02:31:30.839]  Some of them are realizing it.
[02:31:30.959 --> 02:31:33.181]  Some of them are trying to warn the cattle.
[02:31:33.701 --> 02:31:36.383]  But the cattle isn't going to wake up fast enough.
[02:31:37.063 --> 02:31:38.604]  They think they're part of the system.
[02:31:38.624 --> 02:31:39.925]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:31:39.965 --> 02:31:40.705]  I'm being too dark.
[02:31:43.667 --> 02:31:47.730]  Every patriot is now an enemy of the republic.
[02:31:49.231 --> 02:31:53.474]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to some of your calls and I'll get into this other stack of notes.
[02:31:53.754 --> 02:31:54.154]  Quickly!
[02:31:55.155 --> 02:31:56.876]  We will go to your calls.
[02:31:57.819 --> 02:31:58.559]  J.R.
[02:31:58.640 --> 02:31:59.260]  in Texas.
[02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:00.761]  Hello, Alex.
[02:32:01.501 --> 02:32:02.261]  Hello, J.R.
[02:32:02.802 --> 02:32:13.207]  Yeah, I called yesterday, and I'm trying to find out as much as I can about where my constitutional rights stand at the actual border.
[02:32:13.427 --> 02:32:13.967]  That's right.
[02:32:14.027 --> 02:32:15.448]  Right at the end of the show, you got cut short.
[02:32:15.468 --> 02:32:16.348]  I told you to call back.
[02:32:16.368 --> 02:32:17.169]  Thank you for calling back.
[02:32:17.369 --> 02:32:17.809]  Oh, thank you.
[02:32:19.861 --> 02:32:21.982]  Well, I mean, recap what you were saying.
[02:32:22.042 --> 02:32:26.266]  You're down on the border, and as a citizen, you get harassed, but the illegals just pour across.
[02:32:26.486 --> 02:32:28.147]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:32:28.407 --> 02:32:30.749]  All the aliens do is show their papers, and they go through.
[02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:36.613]  And I get asked 20 questions, and I get upset sometimes, and I get frustrated, you know.
[02:32:37.194 --> 02:32:40.896]  And I also get worried that these guys are going to try to frame me for something.
[02:32:40.936 --> 02:32:42.778]  Well, look, they're already making it hard.
[02:32:42.998 --> 02:32:44.419]  That's what this new beefing up does.
[02:32:44.479 --> 02:32:47.041]  It makes it hard for citizens, makes it easier for foreigners.
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:51.141]  Because they say immigration reform, the average fool out there believes it.
[02:32:51.421 --> 02:32:53.341]  Meanwhile, Bush has openly said he wants amnesty.
[02:32:53.361 --> 02:32:54.001]  That's what he's doing.
[02:32:54.321 --> 02:33:02.083]  No, I mean, look, Bush says tattle on your neighbors for marijuana, or if a man and woman are arguing with each other, his terrorist manual says that that's terrorism.
[02:33:02.543 --> 02:33:04.443]  That's what they're training the tattletale corps to do.
[02:33:04.743 --> 02:33:08.584]  Meanwhile, the Minutemen are bad because they're on the border calling the Border Patrol.
[02:33:09.084 --> 02:33:15.585]  And the Homeland Security people, they say that the actual border checkpoint is a federal zone.
[02:33:16.187 --> 02:33:20.668]  And so they give you the impression that, no, you have no rights, that we can ask you anything we want.
[02:33:20.688 --> 02:33:23.309]  Yeah, as if you have no rights if it's a federal zone.
[02:33:23.709 --> 02:33:23.949]  Yeah.
[02:33:24.009 --> 02:33:27.130]  We're in a federal national security event zone, young man.
[02:33:27.150 --> 02:33:28.731]  Show me your papers.
[02:33:29.811 --> 02:33:35.773]  So, yeah, I'm just trying to find, you know, actual documented information on... Well, you can read the legislature.
[02:33:35.813 --> 02:33:36.853]  I mean, it's policy.
[02:33:37.653 --> 02:33:38.734]  I mean, just look what they're doing.
[02:33:38.754 --> 02:33:39.934]  I mean, documentation on what?
[02:33:40.735 --> 02:33:42.316]  Well, just where my rights as a U.S.
[02:33:42.356 --> 02:33:45.318]  citizen stand, so I don't get like... Well, here's the deal.
[02:33:45.358 --> 02:33:52.223]  You have the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth, the Seventh, the Ninth reserves all your rights, even those not listed.
[02:33:53.244 --> 02:33:54.725]  Basic human rights as a human being.
[02:33:55.045 --> 02:33:58.808]  I mean, does government have a right because it wants to to say grab a child and barbecue them?
[02:34:00.056 --> 02:34:03.218]  Because if government is God, like Alberto Gonzalez says, they can.
[02:34:03.658 --> 02:34:04.938]  But no, government is not God.
[02:34:04.998 --> 02:34:10.000]  You have basic rights that aren't even written down, but you have rights that are also enumerated and written down.
[02:34:10.581 --> 02:34:13.022]  The problem is they're saying they don't follow those.
[02:34:13.062 --> 02:34:18.544]  The government's just declaring through fiat that you have no rights.
[02:34:18.644 --> 02:34:21.085]  You've got to resist that.
[02:34:21.125 --> 02:34:22.026]  You've got to speak out.
[02:34:22.066 --> 02:34:22.866]  You've got to inform.
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:24.300]  Okay, Alex.
[02:34:24.681 --> 02:34:25.921]  I would write letters to the editor.
[02:34:25.961 --> 02:34:26.541]  I would talk about it.
[02:34:26.561 --> 02:34:27.782]  I'd complain to supervisors.
[02:34:28.062 --> 02:34:31.464]  They'd probably get promoted, but I would ask them.
[02:34:31.924 --> 02:34:45.351]  Clearly, sir, most of this anti-terrorism is just about drug interdiction, and so they think maybe you've got some Rohibonol or something on you, or some steroids, whatever's being brought across the border by individuals.
[02:34:45.951 --> 02:34:51.894]  And so they're just probably wanting to steal it, usually is what they do, and they don't even bust you, they just keep it for themselves.
[02:34:52.235 --> 02:34:58.038]  I also wanted to touch real quickly on news I saw last night on the local 6 o'clock news.
[02:34:58.058 --> 02:35:04.061]  The local ABC affiliate, KRGV Channel 5, reporting how the Border Patrol and Immigration
[02:35:04.577 --> 02:35:08.978]  Let most of the illegal aliens go, and they even drop them off at the local bus station.
[02:35:09.138 --> 02:35:18.041]  Yeah, the, oh yeah, here's a bus stop for you, and they've got little local so-called churches that help pay for them to get their bus ride into the heartland.
[02:35:18.401 --> 02:35:23.082]  Yeah, there were 400, the Houston Chronicle last year had a headline that in the year before, 400,000 illegals.
[02:35:25.862 --> 02:35:27.082]  Yeah, I smell revolution, Alex.
[02:35:27.122 --> 02:35:27.462]  Oh, that's good.
[02:35:52.188 --> 02:35:52.348]  Yeah.
[02:35:52.808 --> 02:35:54.789]  Well, I mean, Bush wants a bunch of gun control right now.
[02:35:54.829 --> 02:35:56.029]  It's being hailed as conservative.
[02:35:57.430 --> 02:35:58.730]  You're a liberal.
[02:35:58.750 --> 02:35:59.971]  You're for the Second Amendment.
[02:36:00.011 --> 02:36:00.951]  You're a liberal.
[02:36:02.391 --> 02:36:03.312]  God pray for us, Alex.
[02:36:03.772 --> 02:36:04.092]  I know.
[02:36:04.212 --> 02:36:04.652]  I hear you.
[02:36:06.033 --> 02:36:06.813]  Take care, my friend.
[02:36:07.713 --> 02:36:08.893]  I'm out of control here, folks.
[02:36:09.113 --> 02:36:13.935]  I'm in total rant phase, and I want to rant because I'm very upset about what's happening.
[02:36:13.975 --> 02:36:16.536]  But let's speed through the calls.
[02:36:16.556 --> 02:36:17.896]  I've got to go quicker because I've got a bunch of news.
[02:36:18.316 --> 02:36:19.577]  Justin in Ohio!
[02:36:20.208 --> 02:36:24.011]  Yeah, on that note, Bush is such a conservative, he's over there killing millions of people, right?
[02:36:24.931 --> 02:36:28.334]  They are a threat to the homeland!
[02:36:28.354 --> 02:36:30.635]  They're a threat to the republic!
[02:36:31.056 --> 02:36:31.656]  Yeah, of course.
[02:36:32.136 --> 02:36:40.462]  But the question I have for you, back on the subject of the draft, that guest earlier, that idiot sitting there saying that there's no plan at all, there's no intention to ever renew the draft.
[02:36:40.562 --> 02:36:41.983]  But we need one.
[02:36:42.183 --> 02:36:44.305]  Yeah, well, why is it when we turn 18 we've got to sign up for it?
[02:36:44.676 --> 02:36:46.318]  Well, he didn't say there's no intention.
[02:36:46.338 --> 02:36:49.361]  He says it'll be hard to do unless there's a terrorist.
[02:36:49.401 --> 02:36:51.444]  Yeah, a terrorist, right?
[02:36:51.824 --> 02:36:52.085]  Yes.
[02:36:52.505 --> 02:37:01.976]  Well, you know, a question I have for you, I guess, is those of us not under the influence of the mind control machine, and we know the truth, is it right that I have to go over there and kill innocent people?
[02:37:02.136 --> 02:37:05.520]  Or does that make me a terrorist for not wanting to fight in a war that's based upon a lie?
[02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:14.654]  Well, I think you should go and breathe blue uranium and let the government illegally inject you with scores of vaccines.
[02:37:15.255 --> 02:37:24.422]  It's a felony every time they do that, but no one enforces it with experimental shots and where your family goes on welfare and where they keep you there for three tours in a row, never done before.
[02:37:25.362 --> 02:37:30.867]  I think you should just submit to it while the very criminal government that controls our government has stolen trillions from the Pentagon.
[02:37:31.247 --> 02:37:32.688]  Well, that sounds like a good time, I guess.
[02:37:33.028 --> 02:37:33.929]  I think you should submit.
[02:37:34.426 --> 02:37:37.007]  Yeah, well, you know, that's what they're kind of forcing us into.
[02:37:37.047 --> 02:37:39.708]  You know, it goes hand in hand with... What, are you in the military?
[02:37:39.888 --> 02:37:41.308]  No, I'm not in the military whatsoever.
[02:37:41.328 --> 02:37:52.431]  I'm a civilian, you know, and I have no problem with... A lot of mayors call us civilians and police chiefs call us civilians because it's part of the militarization nomenclature.
[02:37:52.491 --> 02:37:54.152]  We're occupied just like Iraq.
[02:37:54.850 --> 02:37:59.133]  And their PSAs are nothing more than propaganda, just like they are in Iraq.
[02:37:59.293 --> 02:38:00.194]  We're here to help you.
[02:38:00.254 --> 02:38:01.054]  We're here to save you.
[02:38:01.094 --> 02:38:02.015]  The government loves you.
[02:38:02.055 --> 02:38:02.315]  We're here.
[02:38:02.555 --> 02:38:03.616]  Oh, everything's good.
[02:38:03.636 --> 02:38:05.037]  Well, it goes hand in hand.
[02:38:05.057 --> 02:38:07.999]  You know, they'll force us into bankruptcy, and then maybe we'll just sign up willingly.
[02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:09.200]  I hear you.
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:09.781]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:09.821 --> 02:38:18.567]  Now, that's part of economic degradation, is the only jobs you'll be able to get after they even shut down the service jobs will be government jobs.
[02:38:18.647 --> 02:38:24.271]  And the government jobs they're offering, look, all the big new horses or Homeland Security...
[02:38:25.077 --> 02:38:26.538]  Or law enforcement or military.
[02:38:27.598 --> 02:38:29.279]  Because that's the jobs you'll be able to have.
[02:38:29.319 --> 02:38:34.481]  We're shifting out of a free market into an empire, a command and control system for a few globalists.
[02:38:35.101 --> 02:38:37.622]  The corporations are acting like government now, okay?
[02:38:38.062 --> 02:38:38.823]  They're taking over.
[02:38:39.063 --> 02:38:39.923]  They're not free market.
[02:38:40.943 --> 02:38:42.604]  Eric in California, welcome.
[02:38:43.024 --> 02:38:43.344]  Hi, thanks.
[02:38:43.705 --> 02:38:45.025]  I'll try to make this as quick as possible.
[02:38:45.045 --> 02:38:47.586]  One of the things, I was researching one of your videos.
[02:38:47.846 --> 02:38:48.867]  Sorry, I forgot which one it was.
[02:38:49.227 --> 02:38:51.968]  But you said that six of the 12 students were shot
[02:38:52.668 --> 02:38:55.450]  I'm confused.
[02:38:55.530 --> 02:39:03.574]  I mean, if you saw the film, you saw the news articles.
[02:39:04.134 --> 02:39:05.275]  I didn't see the news article.
[02:39:05.355 --> 02:39:09.737]  I just heard shortly, like, for a second, you said that one of the six of them.
[02:39:09.777 --> 02:39:10.678]  What evidence do you have?
[02:39:10.698 --> 02:39:11.498]  Because I'm in California.
[02:39:11.518 --> 02:39:12.539]  I wasn't in Columbine.
[02:39:12.915 --> 02:39:15.217]  What do you mean you're greatly offended?
[02:39:15.377 --> 02:39:18.019]  Well, I mean, I've had the editors of the newspapers on.
[02:39:18.079 --> 02:39:19.199]  It's been in the newspapers.
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:20.901]  Yeah, but isn't that true?
[02:39:20.941 --> 02:39:25.564]  We're sure they shot two of them, and eyewitnesses said they shot as many as six.
[02:39:25.964 --> 02:39:26.505]  But why?
[02:39:26.565 --> 02:39:27.245]  I don't understand it.
[02:39:27.285 --> 02:39:28.826]  What is the purpose of that?
[02:39:28.966 --> 02:39:31.929]  Well, I mean, sir, it was in the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post.
[02:39:32.609 --> 02:39:34.550]  The Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post?
[02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:35.571]  I showed the news articles.
[02:39:36.412 --> 02:39:37.312]  In that one video?
[02:39:37.332 --> 02:39:38.353]  Okay, I guess I didn't see that part.
[02:39:38.653 --> 02:39:40.695]  And one of the things that the Patriot Act...
[02:39:41.314 --> 02:39:42.595]  I'm trying to understand.
[02:39:42.635 --> 02:39:46.618]  Where the heck can I get an actual bona fide copy of what the Patriot Act says?
[02:39:46.898 --> 02:39:49.220]  Because I've been looking around for it and I can't seem to find it.
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:49.700]  Really?
[02:39:50.401 --> 02:39:59.067]  Well, we have in the police state section of Infowars.com the Patriot Act section.
[02:39:59.087 --> 02:40:03.591]  And we have the bill saved, a link to the Library of Congress where you can read it there.
[02:40:04.471 --> 02:40:06.332]  Because people don't want to believe a bill we post.
[02:40:06.772 --> 02:40:08.372]  You can read it there for posterity.
[02:40:08.392 --> 02:40:08.992]  You can link over.
[02:40:09.012 --> 02:40:10.833]  They have it archived, as they say.
[02:40:11.213 --> 02:40:12.393]  Backed up, mirrored.
[02:40:12.413 --> 02:40:15.094]  You can go over to the Library of Congress and read it.
[02:40:15.114 --> 02:40:16.114]  Type H.R.
[02:40:16.134 --> 02:40:16.394]  3162 in.
[02:40:16.474 --> 02:40:16.574]  H.R.
[02:40:16.594 --> 02:40:16.934]  6162, right?
[02:40:16.954 --> 02:40:18.695]  Pardon me?
[02:40:18.715 --> 02:40:18.875]  H.R.
[02:40:18.895 --> 02:40:18.875]  6162?
[02:40:18.915 --> 02:40:19.215]  No, no, no, no.
[02:40:19.255 --> 02:40:19.315]  H.R.
[02:40:19.335 --> 02:40:19.315]  3162.
[02:40:19.355 --> 02:40:20.055]  3162.
[02:40:19.375 --> 02:40:20.055]  Passed October 27th.
[02:40:31.198 --> 02:40:32.339]  2001.
[02:40:31.338 --> 02:40:32.339]  Uh-huh.
[02:40:32.639 --> 02:40:41.847]  And the last final thing, because I know you've got quite a lot of calls, is that eventually, if this government, the new order does take over, because honestly, I think if... They have taken over.
[02:40:41.967 --> 02:40:42.828]  They have, completely.
[02:40:42.988 --> 02:40:44.009]  But we still have firearms.
[02:40:44.049 --> 02:40:45.170]  You still have a way to fight.
[02:40:45.450 --> 02:40:49.174]  But yet, it seems like we're... It's like... Oh, gosh, I can't think of a good allegory for it.
[02:40:49.514 --> 02:40:50.675]  It's like we're being smothered.
[02:40:51.035 --> 02:40:54.018]  It's like a candle, when you put a candle in a case, or like... Slow down.
[02:40:54.278 --> 02:40:55.379]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:40:55.639 --> 02:40:57.721]  But the thing is that... One thing I noticed with slavery is that
[02:40:58.403 --> 02:41:00.124]  It tends to run out of steam.
[02:41:00.164 --> 02:41:05.728]  Well, that's if people know they're slaves.
[02:41:05.928 --> 02:41:07.869]  That's only if they know they're slaves?
[02:41:08.210 --> 02:41:11.932]  Therefore, we can continue to be slaves until Jesus comes back, right?
[02:41:12.272 --> 02:41:14.313]  If we don't wake up, if we don't actually do something about this?
[02:41:14.834 --> 02:41:16.215]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:16.755 --> 02:41:22.839]  If you want to know about Patriot Act II, it was the Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[02:41:22.939 --> 02:41:24.320]  We have an analysis of that.
[02:41:25.009 --> 02:41:29.491]  I won the Project Censored Award in 2004 for my analysis of it.
[02:41:30.371 --> 02:41:33.532]  That is on the website, and then a link to the actual bill.
[02:41:36.193 --> 02:41:37.393]  I mean, I don't know what else I can say.
[02:41:38.154 --> 02:41:40.774]  I got criticized for that analysis of the Patriot Act.
[02:41:40.814 --> 02:41:41.515]  I mean, I won an award.
[02:41:41.535 --> 02:41:45.436]  They had a bunch of lawyers and experts look at it and found my analysis was on target.
[02:41:45.536 --> 02:41:48.417]  One day after it was made public, I wrote an analysis of it.
[02:41:48.437 --> 02:41:49.938]  It took me about ten hours to do it.
[02:41:50.978 --> 02:41:52.078]  And then since then, you've heard about it.
[02:41:52.138 --> 02:41:53.699]  Secret arrests, secret searches...
[02:41:54.990 --> 02:41:55.891]  All that stuff's in there.
[02:41:56.191 --> 02:41:58.594]  People just have trouble believing it.
[02:41:58.654 --> 02:42:02.557]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:02.597 --> 02:42:03.778]  I want to cover some news.
[02:42:04.319 --> 02:42:05.680]  William in Florida.
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:06.261]  Last caller.
[02:42:06.301 --> 02:42:06.621]  Go ahead.
[02:42:07.522 --> 02:42:08.223]  Hey Alex, thanks.
[02:42:08.463 --> 02:42:09.243]  I just wondered if...
[02:42:10.839 --> 02:42:20.206]  According to your information, your sources, and just your instincts, what your timetable is, your feeling about upcoming domestic attacks, what the scenario will be.
[02:42:20.286 --> 02:42:22.587]  Are we talking in the next few months, the next year?
[02:42:22.727 --> 02:42:25.529]  I know it's to put you on the spot, but I'm just curious what you think.
[02:42:26.490 --> 02:42:30.272]  Well, I said I didn't think we'd have attacks before the election, domestically.
[02:42:30.473 --> 02:42:31.814]  We'll probably have some attacks in Europe.
[02:42:32.194 --> 02:42:36.517]  I said after the election it gets much worse, and I think they're going to do something really big
[02:42:37.767 --> 02:42:48.790]  Guaranteed, unless we really wake everybody up about who stands to gain from terror and who was behind 9-11, I'd say events that dwarf 9-11 in the next two years.
[02:42:49.771 --> 02:42:53.092]  See, the next few to six months, or do you think it'll be a little longer than that?
[02:42:53.132 --> 02:42:56.633]  I know it's an unfair question, but... I think by the middle of next year.
[02:42:58.433 --> 02:43:04.055]  Alex, on the appeasement thing, I would just refer people to Winston Churchill's fine book, The Gathering Storm.
[02:43:07.683 --> 02:43:09.604]  Yeah, you cannot appease the enemy.
[02:43:09.904 --> 02:43:13.246]  You know, that's just, if they don't believe you, I mean, that's history.
[02:43:13.286 --> 02:43:13.726]  There it is.
[02:43:13.846 --> 02:43:17.948]  That's just one example, but had we gone in, we wouldn't have had World War II.
[02:43:19.608 --> 02:43:23.690]  Well, if our own government hadn't funded Hitler, he's what I call a wind-up toy.
[02:43:23.970 --> 02:43:24.150]  Yeah.
[02:43:26.191 --> 02:43:30.273]  They create the crisis to wreak havoc, then they bring order to the chaos.
[02:43:30.653 --> 02:43:32.254]  Yeah.
[02:43:32.274 --> 02:43:33.355]  I'm trying to spread the word.
[02:43:33.395 --> 02:43:34.235]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:43:34.895 --> 02:43:36.456]  I appreciate the call, William.
[02:43:37.935 --> 02:43:44.539]  All right, let me jump into some more of the news before this broadcast ends here on the final nine minutes.
[02:43:45.419 --> 02:43:46.200]  Not nine minutes.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:53.984]  Well, I guess with the break, about nine and a half minutes, so that's accurate to say that.
[02:43:56.283 --> 02:43:59.005]  I want to now get into some of the other news.
[02:43:59.445 --> 02:44:02.167]  This is... There's no way I can read all this.
[02:44:02.187 --> 02:44:03.788]  It's in the Des Moines Register.
[02:44:03.848 --> 02:44:05.750]  It's posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:06.270 --> 02:44:08.071]  Gannon, is he Johnny Gosch?
[02:44:10.053 --> 02:44:12.815]  Johnny Gosch may have finally been found thanks to Rush Limbaugh.
[02:44:14.496 --> 02:44:22.562]  The Iowa paperboy was kidnapped in 1982 with unsubstantiated stories emerging later that his mother, that he was abducted into a child pedophile ring.
[02:44:22.902 --> 02:44:25.864]  No trace of him has ever been found and no suspects have been arrested.
[02:44:27.065 --> 02:44:41.495]  23 years later, White House correspondent Jeff Gannon, who wrote for a conservative website, was exposed in February as James D. Gucker, same initials as Johnny Gosch, a man with no journalism experience and links to several gay escort addresses online.
[02:44:41.875 --> 02:44:42.635]  What do you mean links?
[02:44:42.795 --> 02:44:43.516]  He's on there.
[02:44:44.616 --> 02:44:51.801]  If you have the time to read a few hundred web postings, you will see how Johnny Gosch and Jeff Gannon, two completely unrelated individuals, became the same person on the web.
[02:44:52.562 --> 02:44:54.783]  The way the theory developed says much about
[02:44:56.813 --> 02:45:01.575]  Anything goes nature of the blogosphere and the self-proclaimed reporters on the internet.
[02:45:01.615 --> 02:45:16.542]  Well, it was the blogs that exposed Gannon to be the fake reporter escort to the president and others who seems to find accuracy and proof a nuisance in uncovering fantastical conspiracies.
[02:45:18.103 --> 02:45:20.844]  It took the random efforts of scores of web bloggers
[02:45:21.607 --> 02:45:29.753]  Prejudice readers and long-time followers of the case to assign to the two men a bizarre shared backstory involving satanic CIA agents.
[02:45:30.314 --> 02:45:32.996]  We've had senators on, experts on, this stuff goes on.
[02:45:33.977 --> 02:45:37.820]  But about DynCorp, about DynCorp, that's it.
[02:45:39.201 --> 02:45:42.223]  Right now, I just want to get Cynthia McKinney, the Congresswoman's question.
[02:45:43.104 --> 02:45:45.806]  And then, the Defense Secretary doesn't deny it.
[02:45:46.186 --> 02:45:49.229]  Again, just imaginary CIA agent white slavery rings, okay?
[02:45:49.509 --> 02:45:50.189]  It's imaginary.
[02:45:51.513 --> 02:45:52.234]  Do you have that clip?
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:02.005]  In the computer, the congresswoman, it's called Grilling Rumsfeld.
[02:46:02.025 --> 02:46:03.607]  Okay, grab it.
[02:46:03.667 --> 02:46:05.590]  I'm going to play just the first few minutes of that right now.
[02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:06.431]  Thanks.
[02:46:06.831 --> 02:46:08.293]  I know it's part of the moment.
[02:46:09.062 --> 02:46:10.843]  I'm throwing out the great folks running the show.
[02:46:11.363 --> 02:46:25.748]  It took random acts and efforts of scores of web bloggers, credulous readers, and long-time followers of the case to assign the two men a bizarre shared backstory involving satanic CIA agents, pedophiles, and presidents, and, of course, Limbaugh.
[02:46:26.588 --> 02:46:27.689]  Go ahead and roll that, okay?
[02:46:28.589 --> 02:46:28.949]  Here it is.
[02:46:32.571 --> 02:46:33.771]  Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[02:46:35.503 --> 02:46:48.750]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[02:46:49.611 --> 02:46:53.753]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[02:46:54.493 --> 02:47:02.778]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[02:47:03.792 --> 02:47:16.423]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox Manthrax vaccine and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[02:47:17.724 --> 02:47:19.886]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S.
[02:47:19.946 --> 02:47:23.409]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[02:47:24.129 --> 02:47:25.250]  That's my first question.
[02:47:25.290 --> 02:47:30.375]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, according to the Comptroller General of the United States,
[02:47:31.016 --> 02:47:36.579]  There are serious financial management problems at the Pentagon, to which Mr. Cooper alluded.
[02:47:37.299 --> 02:47:40.621]  Fiscal year 1999, $2.3 trillion missing.
[02:47:41.201 --> 02:47:44.363]  Fiscal year 2000, $1.1 trillion missing.
[02:47:45.203 --> 02:47:49.926]  And DOD is the number one reason why the government can't balance its checkbooks.
[02:47:50.831 --> 02:47:55.494]  The Pentagon has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money... Thank you.
[02:47:55.774 --> 02:48:00.296]  The point is, and then he gets to the pedophile stuff, and well, they got in trouble for it.
[02:48:00.837 --> 02:48:01.997]  We put them in the penalty box.
[02:48:03.218 --> 02:48:07.220]  Now, we're not saying everything on the blogs or out on the web is true.
[02:48:08.941 --> 02:48:12.643]  But it continues to generate real investigations and break a lot of news.
[02:48:13.604 --> 02:48:17.106]  And the media, the controlled media, the paid-off Pentagon media...
[02:48:18.490 --> 02:48:22.812]  He's trying at breakneck speed to discredit alternative media.
[02:48:22.872 --> 02:48:23.592]  It isn't going to work.
[02:48:23.632 --> 02:48:24.713]  You've already lost.
[02:48:25.333 --> 02:48:26.314]  Try to regulate it.
[02:48:26.334 --> 02:48:27.194]  Try to control it.
[02:48:27.234 --> 02:48:27.874]  It's over!
[02:48:28.515 --> 02:48:29.395]  You've lost!
[02:48:30.396 --> 02:48:31.996]  We said the world was round.
[02:48:32.136 --> 02:48:33.497]  You tried to say it was flat.
[02:48:33.877 --> 02:48:35.378]  We kept saying it was round.
[02:48:35.398 --> 02:48:39.920]  And now you've been disproven and you have lost your credibility.
[02:48:41.441 --> 02:48:42.261]  We're winning.
[02:48:46.869 --> 02:48:54.274]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.

[02:48:59.497 --> 02:49:05.141]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:06.101]  We're good to go.

[02:51:50.743 --> 02:51:52.664]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:53.124 --> 02:51:55.966]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:00.569 --> 02:52:01.970]  So, it's a conspiracy.
[02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:04.231]  I mean, the government's not involved in kidnapping children.
[02:52:06.772 --> 02:52:07.193]  The U.N.'
[02:52:07.173 --> 02:52:07.953]  's not involved.
[02:52:08.033 --> 02:52:09.334]  Coffee Annan's not involved.
[02:52:10.635 --> 02:52:13.296]  Doesn't matter if there's photos of them cutting little kids' heads off.
[02:52:14.157 --> 02:52:15.297]  Just doesn't exist.
[02:52:15.337 --> 02:52:17.719]  Government is good, purely good, as a driven snow.
[02:52:17.779 --> 02:52:19.920]  And if you talk about it bad, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:52:20.931 --> 02:52:23.472]  Mel Gibson pushed for president, Roland Ailey's reporting.
[02:52:24.452 --> 02:52:27.193]  Folks are starting a national movement to try to get Mel Gibson to run for president.
[02:52:27.633 --> 02:52:29.713]  Yeah, he'd make a good president, a great president.
[02:52:31.354 --> 02:52:35.054]  And maybe he'd be the only person that could beat Arnie if they had changed the Constitution.
[02:52:35.555 --> 02:52:37.395]  By the way, Mel Gibson is not from Australia.
[02:52:37.435 --> 02:52:38.635]  They moved there when he was a teenager.
[02:52:38.655 --> 02:52:41.476]  He's from New York, upstate New York.
[02:52:43.331 --> 02:52:44.192]  And I like Mel Gibson.
[02:52:44.432 --> 02:52:45.733]  He's right on line.
[02:52:45.753 --> 02:52:49.116]  He knows all about the New World Order, which is why they never let him be president.
[02:52:50.557 --> 02:52:51.638]  But, hey, you never know.
[02:52:51.678 --> 02:52:52.298]  We could try.
[02:52:53.419 --> 02:52:56.962]  Minutemen catch 141 illegals so far in New Mexico.
[02:52:57.363 --> 02:53:00.145]  Officials hope to expand Citizen Volunteer Project to second today.
[02:53:00.685 --> 02:53:12.095]  In its second day of operations, the Civilian Volunteer Minutemen Project claimed to have aided the Border Patrol in the apprehension of 141 illegal aliens along the Arizona Republic border and deterred many more from attempting to cross from Mexico.
[02:53:13.021 --> 02:53:14.622]  Well, the project gained favorable attention.
[02:53:14.642 --> 02:53:18.465]  A city official from New Mexico announced he would like to expand the project to his state.
[02:53:18.986 --> 02:53:20.006]  Now a city official.
[02:53:20.106 --> 02:53:20.907]  I've got to get him on.
[02:53:23.209 --> 02:53:28.813]  And there's a bunch of other really important news here, but we're almost out of time.
[02:53:28.873 --> 02:53:36.619]  I've got all the articles here where somebody tries to get to their house on the route where Bush is going to be driving, or Dick Cheney is going to be driving hours later.
[02:53:36.639 --> 02:53:38.641]  They just stun gun people for no reason.
[02:53:39.161 --> 02:53:42.604]  Cops go to the wrong house, and somebody says, you got the wrong house, so they stun gun them.
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:45.561]  Just treating us like the enemy, like insurgents.
[02:53:45.601 --> 02:53:46.462]  We're all insurgents.
[02:53:46.482 --> 02:53:47.942]  We're all civilians.
[02:53:48.362 --> 02:53:51.164]  The mayor here in Austin calls us civilians.
[02:53:52.884 --> 02:53:54.205]  He's our military leader.
[02:53:55.626 --> 02:53:56.826]  It's so good.
[02:53:58.087 --> 02:54:03.509]  And I've got articles here where a student who set a smoke bomb off is being charged with the Patriot Act as a terrorist.
[02:54:04.730 --> 02:54:11.273]  This is the kind of stuff that's happening and going on here in the country right now.
[02:54:13.762 --> 02:54:15.604]  I guess that's really the end of the broadcast.
[02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:17.667]  I want to thank everybody for joining us today.
[02:54:17.687 --> 02:54:22.612]  And I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on your local AM and FM stations.
[02:54:23.113 --> 02:54:26.236]  And Global Shortwave at 3210 during the day.
[02:54:26.276 --> 02:54:27.337]  The first two hours are on 9.985.
[02:54:27.377 --> 02:54:27.557]  Is it 9.95?
[02:54:27.597 --> 02:54:28.038]  I don't know.
[02:54:28.098 --> 02:54:30.801]  I know it's moved the third hour to 9.975.
[02:54:36.101 --> 02:54:36.601]  I know that.
[02:54:36.721 --> 02:54:38.822]  I should announce that before the third hour, shouldn't I?
[02:54:38.862 --> 02:54:41.202]  But I haven't been doing that since I learned of it.
[02:54:41.562 --> 02:54:47.344]  Perhaps WWCR will put an announcement on for folks because I've been getting a lot of calls about it.
[02:54:48.124 --> 02:54:48.944]  I appreciate them.
[02:54:50.144 --> 02:54:53.405]  But in the last minute and a half here, listen, you know what's coming.
[02:54:53.465 --> 02:54:58.746]  Get my new video, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State is out.

[02:56:25.054 --> 02:56:26.975]  Now is the time to stand up against the globalists.
[02:56:27.095 --> 02:56:31.156]  Now is the time to get involved and resist this tyranny.
