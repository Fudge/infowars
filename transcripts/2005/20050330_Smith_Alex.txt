[00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:08.972]  We haven't had him on in about a year, and he writes for scores of major respected publications, Wall Street Journal, you name it.
[00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:22.957]  He's written several best-selling books, The Culture of Death among them, and his newest book is A Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World, and I literally couldn't get it away from my wife this morning, so I don't even have it with me in studio, she's reading it.
[00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:35.602]  Because she's my radio producer and also a webmaster at Zinfowars.com, she knows all of it's documented because she posts these articles every day.
[00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.303]  She says the way it's put together in a book is just amazing.
[00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:39.444]  She's a fan.
[00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:42.185]  We get three or four books a day in the mail.
[00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.206]  She doesn't like most of them and doesn't read most of them.
[00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.354]  Leslie has done something that many others haven't done.
[00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:53.457]  Number one, he's not a liberal or a conservative.
[00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:57.061]  He's kind of a Ralph Nader supporter in the past.
[00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.805]  But he writes for conservative publications as well as liberal publications.
[00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.408]  They're trying to make it all left-right argument.
[00:01:03.332 --> 00:01:16.304]  But out of the gate, before we get into Terry Schindler and her estranged husband, before we get into the cloning, which they're announcing all over the place now, we're just going to legalize it totally now.
[00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:21.208]  Before we get into all that, your book, A Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World, Leslie,
[00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:32.673]  For people that don't know, what's really behind the eugenics movement, the Peter Singers, and let's talk about the people who actually beg for food and water that the government's killing.
[00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:34.414]  It just occurred to me... Good morning, Alex.
[00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:35.675]  Welcome, thanks for coming on.
[00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:36.155]  My pleasure.
[00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:42.499]  It occurred to me it must be very interesting to be married to you.
[00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:47.163]  What's going on in this country is worrisome, to say the least.
[00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:51.566]  The bioethics movement, which is, we'll say, the philosophy of health care,
[00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:05.797]  is really trying to take apart the centuries, millennia tradition of Hippocratic medicine of do no harm and is trying to revive the idea that some human lives have greater value than others.
[00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:08.039]  We've talked about this on the show before.
[00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.103]  It's called personhood theory and under personhood theory what matters is not being human but whether one has sufficient cognitive capacity.
[00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.672]  To be deemed a quote, person.
[00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:22.515]  And under this belief system, there are some human beings who are not persons.
[00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:26.138]  For example, all on-born human life are not persons.
[00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:28.520]  But newborn babies might not be persons either.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.781]  You referenced Peter Singer.
[00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.866]  Peter Singer is out promoting infanticide in the Los Angeles Times just a week ago.
[00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:40.131]  Because, and not because these babies are disabled, but because in his mind they're not persons.
[00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:44.536]  He says until 18 months they're quote, mackerel.
[00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:51.124]  Basically he compares them, he says killing a baby is no worse than my catching a mackerel off a pier.
[00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:52.145]  That's how I put it.
[00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:55.008]  But he has equated the life of a fish with the life of a baby.
[00:02:55.512 --> 00:03:01.236]  People like Terri Schiavo are not considered a person because she has a significant cognitive disability.
[00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:05.880]  People like Ronald Reagan, when he was in his Alzheimer's disease, would not be considered a person.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:19.871]  And if you're demeaned as a human non-person, that means not only do you not have the right to life, and we can take away your food and water as is occurring with Terri Schiavo, but many are now advocating that people like Terri Schiavo be harvested for their organs.
[00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:25.178]  And they're already setting up this debate where it's the old against the young.
[00:03:25.178 --> 00:03:31.183]  Instead of knowing that the economy just grows, we can take care of everybody.
[00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:32.825]  But, I mean, it's so sick.
[00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:37.769]  I had a caller before you came on who said, I said, well, what about people who are begging for food and water?
[00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.710]  Did you know they're killing them?
[00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.071]  And the guy goes, yeah, and they should have took care of themselves.
[00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.632]  They shouldn't take stuff from the government.
[00:03:43.632 --> 00:03:53.055]  I mean, they're already setting up this debate where these people psychologically think they're getting ahead by the government killing the old, the infirm, or the weak.
[00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:55.336]  This is nothing but eugenics, is it not?
[00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:59.077]  I quite agree with you, Alex.
[00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:02.658]  And so we see the socialists and the communists and the Nazis falling for this.
[00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:05.479]  And the thing is, it's not just the government.
[00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.880]  You've got HMOs and corporate medicine, too.
[00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:11.098]  That get involved in these kinds of issues.
[00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:17.604]  And we're really in danger of creating what I call a disposable cast, C-A-S-P-E, of people.
[00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:23.250]  That people who are weak, the most weak and vulnerable, are beginning to be seen as unwanted baggage.
[00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.752]  And we're just kind of throwing them out of the lifeboat.
[00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:31.458]  But, see, I have hope because millions of people have rallied to this defense of Terry Schiavo.
[00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:32.519]  People are waking up.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.626]  And radio shows like this one are helping them wake up.
[00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:38.870]  And I don't believe this is inevitable.
[00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.956]  I think if we the people get involved in the democratic process...
[00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.371]  We can maintain morality in medicine and still deal with the issues of resources and so forth.
[00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:48.232]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:04:48.232 --> 00:05:04.899]  You know, the media change agents all are reading off the same sheet of music and the nomenclature of Singer that this degenerate bioethicist folks who calls, you know, old people worthless and retarded children subhuman and children mackerel.
[00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.962]  This guy, stuff that five years ago... Here's the negative, Mr. Smith.
[00:05:09.962 --> 00:05:10.642]  I mean, as you know,
[00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:22.704]  But for those that don't know, whereas five years ago, his nomenclature, you didn't hear it in the media, now I'm hearing them verbatim pushing his whole agenda.
[00:05:22.704 --> 00:05:24.725]  You know, you're absolutely right.
[00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:29.867]  It's certainly not everywhere in the media, but it's become a respectable conversation.
[00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:35.990]  And I forgot who, I think it was Richard John Newhouse, who does First Things, and I'm going to do a very bad
[00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:49.541]  It's a recitation of what he said, but what bioethicists are doing are taking the unthinkable, moving them into the debatable, which moves them to the acceptable, and so they become unremarkable.
[00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.742]  That is the very process we see happening in all of these issues.
[00:05:53.742 --> 00:05:55.582]  Some have gone further than others.
[00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:59.343]  And now infanticide has gone from the unthinkable to the debatable.
[00:05:59.343 --> 00:06:02.784]  Taking food away from Terry Schiavo has gone from the debatable
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:08.203]  To the acceptable, and if this just goes away, it will become unremarkable.
[00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:09.485]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:14.715]  You have been the champion in the Wall Street Journal and other publications of listing the people.
[00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:25.998]  Their names, you know, you've visited them, it's been in the news, where they are actually saying, may I please have food and water, and they say no, and they kill them.
[00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:34.440]  Some people still aren't, and you notice the media didn't pick one of those fights to make it a big issue, they picked one like Terry, where it's kind of nebulous.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.421]  Yeah, and the case you're referring to is called Marjorie Nyberg, N-I-G-H-B-E-R-T, which also happened in Florida, by the way.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:58.234]  And Marjorie Nybert, and I write about this in the book Culture of Death, Marjorie Nybert had a stroke while she was in Alabama and she was moved to Florida to go to a nursing home for rehabilitation because she had lost the ability to swallow.
[00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:05.139]  They put in a feeding tube because they were afraid that if she swallowed long she could aspirate.
[00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.101]  And so her brother
[00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:13.424]  who had power of attorney, had been told by Marjorie, if I'm ever terminally ill, I don't want tubes.
[00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:15.946]  But Marjorie Neiber wasn't terminally ill.
[00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:16.906]  She was disabled.
[00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:21.669]  The only thing that would make her terminally ill was if she didn't get food and water.
[00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.192]  Still, he decided, well, I don't think she'd want this, so he took away her feeding tube.
[00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:31.455]  And Marjorie, as Marjorie lay dying of dehydration, the way Terry is now, she could talk.
[00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:33.896]  And she started begging the nurses for food.
[00:07:33.896 --> 00:07:35.517]  She would say, honey, can I have some food?
[00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:37.200]  Honey, can I have some water?
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.386]  And the nurses were so distraught, you can imagine, that they started sneaking her food and water.
[00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:48.572]  And when Marjorie didn't die on time, the nursing home administrators began to wonder what's going on.
[00:07:48.572 --> 00:07:56.200]  Eventually a nurse became a whistleblower, and for a very short period of time it got into the news.
[00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:01.208]  By the way, that nursing home person was fired for that.
[00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:16.659]  Then what happened was a judge got, these Florida judges I'm really beginning to wonder about, a judge got hold of this case and appointed an attorney for Marjorie who was given 24 hours to look into the case and let him know whether she was competent.
[00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:19.081]  Well, she'd been dehydrated for a month.
[00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:22.824]  So the attorney went about the case, didn't have enough time to really investigate,
[00:08:23.348 --> 00:08:26.630]  Came back and had to tell the judge, well at this point she's not competent.
[00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.092]  And the judge said she is not competent to change her advanced medical directive.
[00:08:31.092 --> 00:08:31.913]  She's gonna die.
[00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:38.536]  And he ordered her to die by dehydration because he didn't think she was competent to ask for the medical treatment of food and water.
[00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:39.657]  Can you imagine?
[00:08:39.657 --> 00:08:47.301]  Now, the last three or four times I had you on over the years, nurses then called in and said, oh yeah, we get in trouble, we kill these people all the time.
[00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:49.723]  And folks, now understand what we're talking about here.
[00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:50.323]  I don't want this to just
[00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:54.788]  You know, go over our heads, or in one ear and out the other.
[00:08:54.788 --> 00:09:02.414]  We're talking about family being able to do this, and these bioethics boards being able to do this, where you're begging for food.
[00:09:02.414 --> 00:09:06.457]  You're talking, and they're killing you.
[00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:11.861]  And so when you do these living wills, it's not clear, oh, you think life support means a breathing machine.
[00:09:11.861 --> 00:09:14.723]  No, no, no, it means a feeding tube.
[00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:19.567]  Yeah, a feeding tube is considered a medical treatment, just like a respirator.
[00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:28.465]  Alex, a lot of people think there's a distinction between extraordinary treatment and ordinary treatment.
[00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:29.225]  There isn't.
[00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:30.526]  There's just treatment.
[00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:36.268]  And if you say, I don't want something, that can include food and water if you can't swallow.
[00:09:36.268 --> 00:09:40.469]  Well, for those that don't know, Marjorie's not the only case of this.
[00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:42.130]  I mean, what can I say?
[00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:51.851]  That is, we are, especially if the person in the nursing home doesn't have family who cares for them, it's possible.
[00:09:51.851 --> 00:10:00.398]  On the other hand, let us come to the defense of people like these nurses who are desperately trying to protect the lives of the people under their care.
[00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:11.768]  The people who are standing against this often are the ones in the trenches of the hospitals and the nursing homes, and some of the times they're willing to risk their jobs to save the lives of people.
[00:10:11.768 --> 00:10:14.530]  For example, the Robert Wendlandt case, which we've talked about,
[00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:31.936]  But in California, which is like the Schiavo case, only Robert could roll a wheelchair down a hospital corridor, and they were going to take away his feeding tube, and a nurse broke confidentiality to warn the mother that this was occurring, and that's what saved Robert's life.
[00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:41.543]  Unbelievable, and folks, they want to get rid of the old in this country, and they're pushing it,
[00:10:42.466 --> 00:10:45.473]  And the average person doesn't know how serious this is.
[00:10:45.473 --> 00:10:47.537]  We'll be right back with our guest Leslie Smith.
[00:10:47.537 --> 00:10:48.640]  We'll get more into his new book.
[00:10:50.203 --> 00:10:55.046]  Diabetics worldwide are experiencing tremendous success in lowering blood sugar and blood pressure.
[00:10:55.046 --> 00:10:59.409]  Attention diabetics and health conscious Americans, your body is starving for nutrients.
[00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:04.152]  And now there's an exciting new scientific breakthrough making inorganic vitamins and minerals obsolete.

[00:11:20.123 --> 00:11:21.323]  The U.S.
[00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:27.426]  9th District Court ruled that Food Matrix is better for maintaining vibrant health than our present inorganic vitamin and mineral supplements.
[00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:33.308]  The Nobel Prize-winning science of Food Matrix has created an organic formula, providing you the vital nutrients you need.
[00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:38.410]  Diabetics worldwide are experiencing lower blood sugar and blood pressure, but it's not just for diabetics.

[00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:53.998]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:12:53.998 --> 00:12:55.059]  The real money folks.
[00:12:58.365 --> 00:13:00.287]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:01.167]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:02.288]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:13:02.288 --> 00:13:02.748]  A 5% increase.
[00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:05.731]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:08.033]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:09.774]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.

[00:13:56.772 --> 00:14:06.879]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated... Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregason, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:09.340]  With a 100% kill.

[00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.252]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:14:57.252 --> 00:14:59.993]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:05.630]  The government, the corporations, you name it.
[00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.832]  They don't want to pay for the old, the young, the infirm.
[00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:14.633]  And so they're selling the population on how loving it is, how compassionate it is.
[00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:16.454]  Why just take someone out of their misery?
[00:15:16.454 --> 00:15:25.177]  But when you look at the actual hospital handbooks that these bioethicists have written up, it's about quality of life.
[00:15:25.177 --> 00:15:26.057]  Are you a person?
[00:15:27.273 --> 00:15:29.155]  And it's very, very serious.
[00:15:29.155 --> 00:15:35.543]  And then it goes into all the eugenics and the cloning and designer children.
[00:15:35.543 --> 00:15:37.705]  And now the levy is broken.
[00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:40.508]  Just all of this is happening.
[00:15:40.508 --> 00:15:43.572]  You find a lot of these quote, animal rights activists.
[00:15:43.572 --> 00:15:47.336]  They say a dog has more value than say an old person.
[00:15:47.336 --> 00:15:47.977]  Wesley Smith
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.841]  I mean, there's so many points.
[00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:51.542]  I know that you're the expert on this.
[00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:52.803]  Just where should we go from here?
[00:15:52.803 --> 00:15:54.684]  What's your new book?
[00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:56.025]  I mean, how do we fight this?
[00:15:56.025 --> 00:15:59.628]  What are some of the other horrors that are going on?
[00:15:59.628 --> 00:16:05.332]  Well, you have... You can go all the way from cloning through these end-of-life issues.
[00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:10.876]  For example, in New Jersey, they have legalized the creation of human-cloned embryos.
[00:16:10.876 --> 00:16:14.058]  They have legalized implantation of those embryos into wombs.
[00:16:14.719 --> 00:16:18.085]  and gestation of those cloned fetuses through the ninth month.
[00:16:18.085 --> 00:16:22.734]  The only thing that you can't do in New Jersey is let a cloned baby be born.
[00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:26.120]  Therefore, what they have legalized is fetal farming.
[00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:31.888]  And there are bills all throughout the country now, in Washington State, Minnesota, and other places.
[00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:32.928]  California.
[00:16:32.928 --> 00:16:36.249]  California wouldn't allow fetal farming.
[00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:41.771]  It created a constitutional right to cloning, and the cloned embryo must be destroyed at 14 days.
[00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:43.372]  But that's already obsolete.
[00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:49.034]  And you know, whenever we talk about the stem cell issue, it's like we're talking about George Bush's funding issue from 2001.
[00:16:50.382 --> 00:16:52.971]  And leftover embryos from in vitro fertilization.
[00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.114]  That's way obsolete.
[00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:56.643]  They're now talking in the state legislation.
[00:16:57.222 --> 00:16:59.844]  Literally about authorizing fetal farming.
[00:16:59.844 --> 00:17:01.226]  I kid you not.
[00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:02.967]  I've had members of Congress on.
[00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:07.991]  I've read the major news articles going back a year and a half ago when they passed that in New Jersey.
[00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:10.073]  And I don't think the average... I mean, I read the bill on air.
[00:17:10.073 --> 00:17:15.137]  It says, bring the baby up to term, nine months, and use it for whatever you want.
[00:17:15.137 --> 00:17:17.800]  I mean, we've already... That's rock bottom right there.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.580]  That's right.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.382]  And the media will not cover it.
[00:17:20.382 --> 00:17:22.644]  They still keep saying it's stem cell research.
[00:17:23.371 --> 00:17:29.156]  So stem cell research, again, is a code word for literal farms, like the Matrix with babies.
[00:17:29.156 --> 00:17:30.237]  It can be, absolutely.
[00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:37.002]  And then death with dignity is code for the state's going to kill people begging for food.
[00:17:37.002 --> 00:17:43.508]  You know, you have a way of putting things, Alex, that are pretty hard, but in some cases accurate.
[00:17:43.508 --> 00:17:48.212]  But again, they're only selling part of this agenda, Wesley, by lying about it.
[00:17:48.212 --> 00:17:51.134]  Oh, the lies in these issues are incredible.
[00:17:51.744 --> 00:17:52.044]  I think so.
[00:18:10.064 --> 00:18:13.545]  If you implanted a bunch of skin cells, you'd never get a baby.
[00:18:13.545 --> 00:18:15.646]  You implant an embryo, you get a baby.
[00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:17.886]  The definitions in science are changing.
[00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:31.930]  Postmodernism has come to science, meaning that what they do now is, rather than just set forth the facts objectively, they have a narrative they want, that is, they want to legalize therapeutic cloning, so they change the definitions to win the political debate.
[00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.751]  But that's a corruption of science.
[00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:35.491]  That's not science.
[00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:37.232]  In fact, science is becoming a religion.
[00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:41.367]  Explain that for people.
[00:18:41.367 --> 00:18:54.198]  It's called scientism, where the belief is that science is the key to human salvation, and that we might even be able to get a material immortality.
[00:18:54.198 --> 00:19:01.945]  I urge your listeners, and I don't know if you've got a computer in front of you, Alex, go to Google or Yahoo, and type in transhumanism.
[00:19:01.945 --> 00:19:02.806]  T-R-A-N-S.
[00:19:02.806 --> 00:19:03.787]  No, I've had them on.
[00:19:03.787 --> 00:19:05.088]  I've had them on, and they...
[00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:16.959]  Better humans and all that stuff, and they say, oh, you'll all have to have chips, because you have to go along with the rest of us in our evolution, and we the technocracy elite, we're going to take control.
[00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:24.123]  Right, and we are in danger right now of creating a society in which science doesn't serve us, but dominates us.
[00:19:24.123 --> 00:19:27.125]  And bottom line, the elite isn't going to let us have access to this anyways.
[00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.526]  This is what they've given us.
[00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:28.946]  You're right.
[00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:32.264]  I mean, let's assume therapeutic cloning works.
[00:19:32.264 --> 00:19:38.729]  It would be so expensive that the only people who could get access to it would be George Soros.
[00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.150]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.473]  No, listen, I read what they say and what they're doing and all the big money funding and they're saying it works.
[00:19:44.473 --> 00:19:47.055]  Folks, look, it's 2005, Wesley.
[00:19:47.055 --> 00:19:49.036]  It's the future.
[00:19:49.036 --> 00:19:53.640]  Well, they haven't prevailed yet, Alex, and you're still on the air, so let's keep fighting it.
[00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:58.325]  No, I agree with you, but I'm glad you brought up that New Jersey situation.
[00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:11.517]  I mean, they can implant these babies and then bring them up to nine months and the baby has no rights, but then in a case where somebody kills a woman with a five month old baby in her, he gets two murder charges.
[00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:15.089]  Yeah.
[00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:22.536]  I want to talk about more of your book, A Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World by Wesley J. Smith, now out in major bookstores.
[00:20:22.536 --> 00:20:25.319]  And take your calls when we get back.
[00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:29.043]  And of course, get your take on the Terry Shivo case in some detail.
[00:20:29.043 --> 00:20:30.364]  But your calls are coming up at 800-259-9231.
[00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:35.609]  And Wesley's not pulling punches, folks.
[00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.390]  This is what's happening.
[00:20:40.543 --> 00:20:44.474]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:20:44.474 --> 00:20:47.162]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:52.654 --> 00:20:58.556]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:58.556 --> 00:21:03.017]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:21:03.017 --> 00:21:10.019]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:16.680]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.261]  There are no side effects.
[00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:21.361]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:23.682]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:31.203]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:21:31.203 --> 00:21:34.604]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.492]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:21:39.492 --> 00:21:39.692]  Call today.
[00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:52.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:52.143 --> 00:21:56.384]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:56.384 --> 00:21:59.325]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:59.325 --> 00:22:06.227]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:06.227 --> 00:22:09.448]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:09.448 --> 00:22:11.949]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:11.949 --> 00:22:18.951]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic
[00:22:18.951 --> 00:22:19.351]  We're good to go!
[00:22:49.748 --> 00:22:51.629]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be in force.
[00:22:51.629 --> 00:22:53.849]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:22:53.849 --> 00:22:54.690]  Prepare yourself.
[00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.531]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:20.068]  U.S.
[00:23:20.068 --> 00:23:21.209]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[00:23:21.209 --> 00:23:22.469]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:23.290]  Which are collectible?
[00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.090]  Which are bullion?

[00:23:28.733 --> 00:23:29.313]  Coins.

[00:23:59.648 --> 00:24:06.070]  Daryl and Travis and John and Don and Dave, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.410]  It comes down to this.
[00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.391]  People are lazy and self-centered.
[00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:20.574]  We've had the bounty of having a free society, the highest GDP, highest standard of living, 4% of the population with half the world's wealth.
[00:24:20.574 --> 00:24:25.955]  But the global corporations that are not free market, that operate as organized crime syndicates predominantly,
[00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:38.288]  Of the 100 biggest governments, 45 of them are corporations, biggest GDPs, and they are literally engineering society.
[00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:41.570]  They say they're, quote, taking control of the evolutionary process.
[00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.491]  They think they're God.
[00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:44.172]  And they say this.
[00:24:44.172 --> 00:24:46.633]  They know you're not reading their own policy reports.
[00:24:46.633 --> 00:24:49.475]  They know that you're not investigating what they're doing.
[00:24:49.475 --> 00:24:59.561]  And they know they can sell you, instead of black against white, or northern against southerner, or catholic against protestant, the new thing is going to be old against young, or sick against healthy.
[00:24:59.561 --> 00:25:03.644]  And it's really a sick system.
[00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:07.146]  Folks, if we don't take care of the least of us, then
[00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.752]  It's not a society any of us want to live in.
[00:25:09.752 --> 00:25:13.275]  You know, we don't do anything when the SWAT team hits our neighbors.
[00:25:13.275 --> 00:25:14.196]  We don't find out why.
[00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:15.598]  We don't do anything.
[00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:17.039]  We don't even know our neighbors.
[00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:23.866]  The windows all glow blue in my neighborhood at night because everybody's inside watching television.
[00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:26.808]  Our community, our families have been broken down.
[00:25:26.808 --> 00:25:32.534]  Gloria Steinem was openly funded by the CIA to start Miss Magazine, openly to break down the family.
[00:25:33.257 --> 00:25:37.199]  It's all about control, and they've done a superb job.
[00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:43.662]  To control us, they've got to handicap us, mentally, psychologically.
[00:25:43.662 --> 00:25:50.005]  And being self-centered is really at the heart of illness, mental illness in this country.
[00:25:50.005 --> 00:25:59.950]  We have a very self-centered, sick society, telling the rest of us that are half-decent and half-normal, none of us are perfect, that something's wrong with us.
[00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.832]  Mr. Smith, any comments to what I was just babbling about?
[00:26:03.617 --> 00:26:05.299]  I don't think you're babbling.
[00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:13.305]  You know, I don't use the kind of lexicon you use, but I think it's true.
[00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:19.210]  Unless we care for the least and most vulnerable in this country, none of us is safe.
[00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:25.335]  First, all of us at some point, assuming we don't get hit by a truck, will become defenseless and vulnerable.
[00:26:25.335 --> 00:26:32.221]  Second, once you go down this road of saying some of us are not worthy of protection, the unprotectables
[00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.511]  The untouchables expand.
[00:26:34.511 --> 00:26:36.132]  The categories expand.
[00:26:36.132 --> 00:26:40.194]  And so, unless we protect people like Terry, in the end, none of us is safe.
[00:26:40.194 --> 00:26:42.115]  So, I think you're right on the money.
[00:26:42.115 --> 00:26:53.080]  Well, they're... I mean, in England, they're talking about scanning people's genetics and not letting them have children, quote, if they've got aggressive genes or genes for mental illness, but... That's right.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.661]  And in England, that's eugenics.
[00:26:54.661 --> 00:27:00.424]  And in England, right now, a man has filed a lawsuit with a... He has something like Lou Gehrig's disease.
[00:27:00.424 --> 00:27:01.985]  It's not that disease, but it's similar.
[00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:09.536]  And he filed a lawsuit wanting to make sure that when he became unable to swallow, he could have a feeding tube.
[00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:11.657]  He wants a feeding tube.
[00:27:11.657 --> 00:27:17.580]  The government is resisting and appealing his winning of that lawsuit.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.761]  And it's based on socialized medicine.
[00:27:19.761 --> 00:27:23.063]  They don't want to spend the money on his care because he's not worth living.
[00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:29.339]  The problem with socialism comes in as it sets us all up against each other.
[00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:30.079]  Exactly right.
[00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:41.885]  And healthcare rationing, and healthcare rationing, which we are beginning to impose in this country through bioethics, you end up with people with multiple sclerosis pitted against people with Lou Gehrig's disease, pitted against people with AIDS, pitted against people with cancer.
[00:27:41.885 --> 00:27:47.067]  And those with good political clout tend not to be hurt, and those without it tend to get it in the neck.
[00:27:48.268 --> 00:28:00.398]  Well, I mean, statistically, I've seen the numbers on this, but the Stephen Hawking's, the physicists of the world, all these people that do some of the best work of their life, Beethoven, you know, when he was deaf.
[00:28:00.398 --> 00:28:00.598]  Yeah.
[00:28:00.598 --> 00:28:11.067]  I mean, so many, so many times a disabled person develops other areas of their mind and body and give us some of the greatest attributes we've ever seen.
[00:28:11.067 --> 00:28:17.132]  And even if they don't, when we love them and care for them, we are being as human as we ever can be.
[00:28:17.751 --> 00:28:23.474]  When we cast them aside, how are we different than the herd of antelope that leaves their limping brother to the lion?
[00:28:23.474 --> 00:28:27.736]  Well, in the hierarchy of needs, I mean, that's really what life is about, is service.
[00:28:27.736 --> 00:28:28.736]  That's the... Yes.
[00:28:28.736 --> 00:28:33.038]  I mean, service, folks, to me, feels a thousand times better than a brand new car.
[00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:34.139]  Yes!
[00:28:34.139 --> 00:28:37.140]  Alex, that is a human approach to life.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.121]  That is what makes us special in the universe.
[00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:44.750]  But, again, I'm not sitting here slapping you on the back or slapping me on the back.
[00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:45.250]  No, of course not.
[00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:53.112]  I mean, really, isn't it self-preservation in our genetics that taking care of others, we know that comes back on us?
[00:28:53.112 --> 00:28:54.612]  You know, you could look at it that way.
[00:28:54.612 --> 00:29:03.894]  I look at it a little more, hopefully, that that is something that we have developed because, you know, back in Rome, we'd leave disabled babies and expose them on hills.
[00:29:03.894 --> 00:29:04.954]  We don't do that anymore.
[00:29:05.402 --> 00:29:09.409]  I think it is a consequence of our growing understanding of the need for ethics.
[00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:13.035]  And I think it flows out of, frankly, the Judeo-Christian tradition.
[00:29:13.035 --> 00:29:19.325]  And we're now literally trying to turn back the clock to the point where, figuratively speaking, we expose infants on hills again.
[00:29:20.365 --> 00:29:25.246]  Well, I mean, I myself am a Christian, and you know, Christ said, Suff the little children.
[00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:28.587]  You know, if you're mean to the weak, that's the worst thing you can do.
[00:29:28.587 --> 00:29:41.889]  And again, folks, in Nazi Germany, in Russia, in China today, with all these eugenics getting the UN awards, they don't just stop with the person, again, who can't feed themselves.
[00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:45.430]  It expands out.
[00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.370]  I can't disagree with you.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.303]  Well, I mean, I haven't had a chance to read your book yet, but the reviews are rave, including in my own household.
[00:29:53.303 --> 00:29:59.646]  Tell us more about the book, I mean, some of the other things you talk about, because, you know, Brave New World, A Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World.
[00:29:59.646 --> 00:30:01.147]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:04.289]  Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World does two things.
[00:30:04.289 --> 00:30:13.293]  First, you know, a lot of people want to participate in these issues over cloning, stem cell research, and genetic engineering, but they're afraid that they can't understand the science.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.742]  So you mentioned that I've worked with Ralph Nader, which I have.
[00:30:16.742 --> 00:30:20.125]  I went back to my old consumer advocacy roots.
[00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:29.372]  And the first part of the book is dedicated to helping people understand what a stem cell is, how cloning works, why it creates a new human life, and so forth.
[00:30:29.372 --> 00:30:36.017]  So that whether people agree with me or not, at least when they come away from reading the first section of the book, they'll understand the science.
[00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:37.118]  It's easy to understand.
[00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:40.701]  They're going to have the proper definitions, which the media accounts on us not having.
[00:30:40.701 --> 00:30:41.241]  That's right.
[00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:43.463]  And the science community, which tries to
[00:30:44.122 --> 00:30:44.523]  I don't
[00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.171]  Uh, high school biology understands that.
[00:31:06.171 --> 00:31:09.332]  Well, we're going to bring the cell bundle to nine months term.
[00:31:09.332 --> 00:31:10.113]  That's right.
[00:31:10.113 --> 00:31:13.634]  And then you realize the cell bundle is an embryo that becomes a fetus.
[00:31:13.634 --> 00:31:16.836]  And by the way, you and I are just cell bundles if you get down to it.
[00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:20.978]  In fact, if you wanted to really get deconstructed... We are colonies of cells.
[00:31:20.978 --> 00:31:21.498]  That's right.
[00:31:21.498 --> 00:31:27.721]  And if you wanted to get deconstructionist, we can't be differentiated from carrots because we're all based on carbon-based molecules.
[00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:36.366]  Well, actually, I've had these transhumanists on the show, I mean, top scientists, and they just giggle and laugh and say, uh, yes, the elite's taking control.
[00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:40.888]  I mean, these people, when I've had them on, they sound like lunatics.
[00:31:40.888 --> 00:31:45.691]  Well, yeah, and unless we get involved, they are going to be in control.
[00:31:45.691 --> 00:31:52.655]  But I think that the people in the public square can stop that, which is why I spend so much time writing and going on shows like yours.
[00:31:53.197 --> 00:32:04.325]  You know, I've also made a study, you can do so much with a search engine, of these top bioethicists and these eugenics people, and type in their name and then artwork, and you'll get the art.
[00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:16.674]  I mean, of course you know about Kevorkian and the blood paintings of babies being eaten by demons, but almost every one of these guys or gals, you look at the art they have, it's like demons eating children and blood and death.
[00:32:16.674 --> 00:32:18.876]  It seems like it's a mentally ill crew of people.
[00:32:19.893 --> 00:32:26.958]  It is certainly not the kind of people you would want to have their values and control of society.
[00:32:26.958 --> 00:32:29.479]  Well, I mean, you talk about cultures of death.
[00:32:29.479 --> 00:32:32.681]  It seems to be their overriding lust.
[00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:36.303]  There does seem to be a dark embrace of death.
[00:32:36.303 --> 00:32:43.768]  At the same time, there's this kind of desperate grasping for science and biotechnology to hold off death at all costs.
[00:32:44.352 --> 00:32:49.536]  You know, these transhumanists would make me laugh if their values weren't so dangerous.
[00:32:49.536 --> 00:32:52.518]  On one hand, they say, humans aren't good enough the way we are.
[00:32:52.518 --> 00:32:53.479]  We're not smart enough.
[00:32:53.479 --> 00:32:54.940]  We're not healthy enough.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.160]  And we're not pretty enough.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.402]  And yet, doggone it, we die so soon.
[00:32:58.402 --> 00:33:08.269]  You know, it kind of reminds me of the old Borscht Belt joke that says, the woman says, how was the meal?
[00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:10.791]  And the other lady says, terrible in such small portions.
[00:33:13.032 --> 00:33:18.655]  I know, and I mean, life is so wonderful in all of its complexity, and yes, to use that word, diversity.
[00:33:18.655 --> 00:33:24.678]  I mean, we're talking about the state taking control.
[00:33:24.678 --> 00:33:27.679]  Or the corporations, with the help of the state.
[00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:32.982]  I mean, what we have to do is make sure that the people stay in control, which is, again, I know why you work so hard.
[00:33:32.982 --> 00:33:34.583]  It's your effort.
[00:33:34.583 --> 00:33:37.944]  A Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World by Wesley J. Smith.
[00:33:40.231 --> 00:33:41.592]  Tell us more about the book.
[00:33:41.592 --> 00:33:44.052]  What are some of the other facets you cover?
[00:33:44.052 --> 00:33:46.793]  I then get into, after you learn the science, right?
[00:33:46.793 --> 00:34:00.819]  I make an ethical argument about how, if we're going to maintain human equality and human rights, we must outlaw all human cloning and at the same time push very hard for adult stem cell research and other forms of moral biotechnology.
[00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:03.480]  For example, Alex, did you know that right now about 24
[00:34:04.983 --> 00:34:15.028]  People with quadriplegia like Christopher Reeve have had really interesting treatments in Lisbon, Portugal using their own adult stem cells from their nose called olfactory tissues.
[00:34:15.028 --> 00:34:15.728]  Yes.
[00:34:15.728 --> 00:34:19.490]  And these people have regained bladder control.
[00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:23.652]  Some of them are able to now walk using braces or stand up with a walker.
[00:34:23.652 --> 00:34:25.233]  This is a huge achievement.
[00:34:25.233 --> 00:34:27.674]  It's an early research and we can't say that it's
[00:34:29.096 --> 00:34:43.985]  You know, it hasn't worked yet because it has to go through more research and peer review and things of that sort, but this is outstanding and the media doesn't cover it, but if there's a mouse with an embryonic stem cell that looks like it walks a little better, it makes the front page of the New York Times.
[00:34:43.985 --> 00:34:52.270]  Well, I mean, statistically, and I've probably interviewed 50 scientists on the subject, adult stem cells seem to be more easily manageable and controllable than embryonic.
[00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:56.313]  Yes, because the embryonic are so hard to control, they cause tumors.
[00:34:58.317 --> 00:35:04.500]  Which I've had top scientists on who are for all this, but then they admit that, oh, this could give rise to super viruses!
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:12.323]  Well, I don't know about that, but it could definitely give rise to tumors, and they could create artificially super viruses.
[00:35:12.323 --> 00:35:18.726]  In fact, I think they have created a, I forgot what kind of virus it was, a polio virus or something of that sort.
[00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:19.986]  Mouse pox?
[00:35:19.986 --> 00:35:23.748]  Something artificially, and it's very dangerous when you consider the terrorist threat.
[00:35:24.574 --> 00:35:25.074]  Absolutely.
[00:35:25.074 --> 00:35:28.516]  Just real quick, Terry Schiavo, then we've got loaded phones here.
[00:35:28.516 --> 00:35:29.117]  Sure.
[00:35:29.117 --> 00:35:30.737]  Terry Schiavo, here's a few of the things.
[00:35:30.737 --> 00:35:32.358]  Nurse, Terry can eat normally.
[00:35:32.358 --> 00:35:34.880]  Interviewed her four years ago, now it's in the news.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.262]  Nurse, Michael tried to kill Terry.
[00:35:38.262 --> 00:35:44.425]  Regardless, he's abandoned her ten years ago.
[00:35:44.425 --> 00:35:47.126]  Just your take on this whole thing.
[00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:49.988]  I think that Terry Schiavo is a mirror that reflects
[00:35:50.925 --> 00:35:53.366]  On each and every one of us who look at her.
[00:35:53.366 --> 00:35:59.770]  And we can look at the state of our own heart and soul by the way we react to her, in my view.
[00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:15.178]  Quite frankly, I want to focus on it and talk about it, but when they're already legalizing bringing babies up to nine months for parts, and they're killing people begging for food and water, I wish I could focus people not just on Terry, but on the even more obvious cases.
[00:36:15.178 --> 00:36:19.200]  But again, the media is not going to play that game with us, because that wouldn't be a good poster child for them.
[00:36:21.249 --> 00:36:24.470]  I think the media has done an abysmal job, generally, of covering these issues.
[00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.831]  With exceptions, but generally.
[00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:29.952]  Well, yeah, it's just incredible.
[00:36:29.952 --> 00:36:33.453]  You know, she's now, what, five, six days into not having food and water.
[00:36:33.453 --> 00:36:38.954]  Yeah, I think, Alex, honestly, I think she's out of options.
[00:36:38.954 --> 00:36:42.135]  Honestly.
[00:36:42.135 --> 00:36:47.337]  Unless the Supreme Court steps in today, she's going to be so badly damaged.
[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.531]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:55.295]  I had somebody call me last night with something very intriguing, and it kind of sent chills up my back.
[00:36:55.295 --> 00:37:01.899]  She said, you know, I think that Terry's going to die on Good Friday, and that her mother's name is Mary.
[00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:05.521]  And she thought that was quite significant, and I went, holy cow!
[00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:10.504]  So, you know, we can take that for what it might be worth or not worth.
[00:37:10.504 --> 00:37:13.006]  Well, yeah, she'll certainly turn into a martyr.
[00:37:13.884 --> 00:37:15.224]  I think she is.
[00:37:15.224 --> 00:37:16.725]  In many ways, I think that's right.
[00:37:16.725 --> 00:37:24.746]  And I think she can become a rallying cry for the people to take back from the elites our value system.
[00:37:24.746 --> 00:37:29.967]  Or we can go back to sleep and start watching Survivor at night and just allow these things to wash over us.
[00:37:29.967 --> 00:37:31.628]  Well, you were talking about the Romans.
[00:37:31.628 --> 00:37:35.308]  They would put people in a cage and hang them out over the side of the parapet for a week.
[00:37:35.308 --> 00:37:37.269]  Yeah, and of course we're never going to do that.
[00:37:37.269 --> 00:37:38.589]  We'll just give them the poison needle.
[00:37:40.154 --> 00:37:40.735]  Unbelievable.
[00:37:40.735 --> 00:37:42.336]  Let's take a call here.
[00:37:42.336 --> 00:37:45.298]  Let's talk to Daryl in Delaware, then Travis, John, and others.
[00:37:45.298 --> 00:37:48.300]  Go ahead, Daryl.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.181]  You're on the air, Daryl.
[00:37:49.181 --> 00:37:52.203]  Alright, that caller's not there.
[00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:54.084]  Travis, Travis, you're on the air.
[00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:57.246]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:37:57.246 --> 00:38:00.829]  You know, when it rains, it pours with these callers, I tell you.
[00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:02.130]  Yeah, Travis, you gonna talk?
[00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:02.850]  Oh yeah, sure am.
[00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:03.831]  I'm calling from Seattle, bud.
[00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:14.612]  I just got a few comments that Mr. Smith guy sounds like a pretty educated individual but when I was born they cut the umbilical cord to my mother so I don't say we anymore.
[00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:20.875]  It reminds me when I'm watching a football game everybody goes oh we're gonna win we're gonna win well that's not we're that's them.
[00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:28.097]  The same thing with this country when you say we are over there doing this and we're doing that we're not doing nothing I'm sitting here independent and I am liberated.
[00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:34.233]  Yeah, but by letting this government get away with this, we are still party to it.
[00:38:34.233 --> 00:38:39.596]  Well, I'm doing what I can, Alex, to let people know how I feel about this government and who controls it.
[00:38:39.596 --> 00:38:41.357]  Well, I want the responsibility.
[00:38:41.357 --> 00:38:45.160]  I want to say that we're over there killing innocent people in Iraq.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.480]  Wesley?
[00:38:46.556 --> 00:38:52.560]  Well, I don't want to get into the Iraq issue because, you know, I focus on bioethics issues and I want people who agree with me.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:52.660]  Sure.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.680]  I wasn't talking about Iraq.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.822]  I mean, this is the philosophical point.
[00:38:56.822 --> 00:39:04.687]  When the government does something as government policy, even if we disagree with it, it's still us doing it as a country, as a collective nation.
[00:39:04.687 --> 00:39:08.429]  Well, see, that's where I disassociate myself from that and that's why I don't even pay income tax.
[00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.470]  So, that's me.
[00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.731]  Well, it's good for you to get away with it.
[00:39:11.731 --> 00:39:12.952]  Well, it's a fact.
[00:39:12.952 --> 00:39:14.633]  The 16th Amendment was not ratified.
[00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:17.762]  No, I'm willing to go to court over it.
[00:39:17.762 --> 00:39:20.544]  Listen, listen, I have used the same point you're making.
[00:39:20.544 --> 00:39:32.312]  I actually agree with you that, you know, that we're not, you know, our military, our, our, our, it's mainly the corporate's military, but what I'm saying is that we still have a responsibility to fight it, and I think you're doing that.
[00:39:32.312 --> 00:39:33.413]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:37.596]  Just when I say we, I feel too morally responsible, and then I feel like I'm getting crushed by it.
[00:39:37.596 --> 00:39:38.116]  Sure.
[00:39:38.116 --> 00:39:39.337]  Do you have any comments or questions?
[00:39:39.657 --> 00:39:42.018]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the caller Paul.
[00:39:42.018 --> 00:39:53.203]  I just don't know where his mindset was because it would be like me going over here to a neighbor's house who happens to be old and offering him $80,000 for his home and say, this will put you up in a retirement home for the rest of your life.
[00:39:53.203 --> 00:39:57.805]  And then me turning around and selling that home for $180,000, $200,000 and calling it business.
[00:39:57.805 --> 00:40:00.146]  That way I can buy my own medical insurance.
[00:40:00.146 --> 00:40:01.627]  See, I don't buy that argument.
[00:40:01.627 --> 00:40:02.607]  That's not morally right.
[00:40:02.607 --> 00:40:05.928]  Well, I mean, you're talking about the guy who earned the award.
[00:40:05.928 --> 00:40:07.329]  Yeah, your first caller of the show today.
[00:40:08.514 --> 00:40:09.836]  He wasn't the first caller.
[00:40:09.836 --> 00:40:12.179]  The first one I caught, anyway.
[00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:17.926]  To say, okay, I'm going to go buy a mutual fund, and AT&T is at the head of it.
[00:40:17.926 --> 00:40:27.397]  Well, if you read the fine print, they own stock in the casinos in Vegas, and I don't really care for gambling, because I think it's the dumb man's way of going in and trying to make money.
[00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:33.286]  No, bottom line is, these people call business, business, when it's not business, it's morally wrong.
[00:40:33.286 --> 00:40:39.350]  But, yet, you can set yourself up with insurance, which I think is wrong, because you're paying somebody else to be responsible for your own actions.
[00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.392]  Alright, hey, I hear you Travis, good points.
[00:40:41.392 --> 00:40:44.374]  John in Louisiana, you're on the air with Wesley Smith, go ahead.
[00:40:44.374 --> 00:40:51.079]  Yes, uh, Alex, uh, I want to talk about the Scalvo case, but first I wanted to hit that, uh, Arnold Schwarzenegger case.
[00:40:51.079 --> 00:40:54.121]  There ain't no way that he can be president, plain and simple.
[00:40:55.509 --> 00:41:01.514]  He's a ploy, a straw man, a decoy to drive us into the arms of whom?
[00:41:01.514 --> 00:41:03.315]  Of Condo Rice.
[00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:09.720]  That's the whole game plan for those people and it's working like a charm and it'll work right up to election day and so forth.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:23.071]  But about the Schiavo case, the Romans, one of the Romans' great contributions to civilization was that they brought compassion to their courtrooms, to their judges.
[00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:28.063]  And we, in our lifetime, have thrown compassion out of our courts.
[00:41:28.063 --> 00:41:31.005]  Our courts are now devoid of compassion.
[00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:34.747]  And the Seattle case, plainly, demonstrates that.
[00:41:34.747 --> 00:41:41.150]  All those judges now have become Oliver Wendell Holmes types, heartless as a law book.
[00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.951]  How does anybody answer that?
[00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:46.473]  Alright, we'll comment on the other side with our guest, Wesley Smith.
[00:41:46.473 --> 00:41:46.873]  Stay with us.
[00:41:50.413 --> 00:41:54.964]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:41:54.964 --> 00:41:58.814]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:42:01.613 --> 00:42:03.995]  Use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:42:03.995 --> 00:42:06.037]  A New World Order.
[00:42:06.037 --> 00:42:07.078]  Can emerge.
[00:42:07.078 --> 00:42:11.363]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:42:11.363 --> 00:42:18.430]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.432]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:42:20.652 --> 00:42:31.240]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:37.325]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:42:41.568 --> 00:42:43.509]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:55.445]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:42:55.445 --> 00:43:03.794]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:43:03.794 --> 00:43:10.841]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:43:11.781 --> 00:43:18.462]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:23.663]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:43:23.663 --> 00:43:32.805]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:43:32.805 --> 00:43:36.126]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:43:38.206 --> 00:43:38.867]  We're good to go!
[00:44:06.224 --> 00:44:06.884]  We're good to go!

[00:44:56.877 --> 00:45:00.338]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:45:00.338 --> 00:45:04.819]  Alright, I want to move quick and give the three final dollars here with Wesley Smith.
[00:45:04.819 --> 00:45:10.061]  It's a new book, A Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World, like 17 bucks on Amazon.com.
[00:45:10.061 --> 00:45:14.143]  I suggest you get it, or link through via InfoWars.com to the publisher.
[00:45:15.303 --> 00:45:18.845]  But real fast, Wesley, answering the last caller's question.
[00:45:18.845 --> 00:45:22.807]  Yeah, these judges are getting very, very heartless, you know.
[00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:25.488]  One of the judges said she will die.
[00:45:25.488 --> 00:45:28.849]  I mean, it seems like they're drunk on power.
[00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:34.072]  Well, I do think, and I say this very reluctantly, that we're heading for a constitutional crisis.
[00:45:34.072 --> 00:45:40.955]  I think that the judiciary is the one branch of government that has the fewest checks and balances built into the Constitution.
[00:45:41.713 --> 00:45:45.957]  That, it seems to me, makes it imperative that judges act with self-restraint.
[00:45:45.957 --> 00:45:48.319]  They're not doing that anymore, Alex.
[00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:53.523]  There's almost an imperialism happening, especially with regard to social issues.
[00:45:54.678 --> 00:45:56.600]  Which are, by definition, political.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:03.306]  So instead of allowing the political issues to play itself out, judges are just deciding that their personal views are going to decide.
[00:46:03.306 --> 00:46:09.252]  Well, it's like in California, 70% of people vote to control the borders, and a judge says no.
[00:46:09.252 --> 00:46:17.860]  That's right, and in that case, and I live in California, Gray Davis just decided not to pursue the appeal.
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.162]  It gets very, very dicey.
[00:46:20.772 --> 00:46:29.975]  And a great concern, because if we end up in a constitutional crisis, it's just going to further divide this country, which is already kind of crumbling.
[00:46:29.975 --> 00:46:37.697]  The cohesiveness of the country is crumbling, because we have two value systems that seem to be conflicting for dominance in the country.
[00:46:37.697 --> 00:46:42.038]  And the good values are losing out, because most our leaders are controlled opposition.
[00:46:42.038 --> 00:46:45.199]  Don, in Indiana, you're on the air.
[00:46:45.199 --> 00:46:46.799]  Go ahead, Don.
[00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:47.900]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.080]  Hello.
[00:46:50.037 --> 00:46:52.537]  I just thought I'd add some input here.
[00:46:52.537 --> 00:46:58.278]  I work security in a hospital on a midnight shift in Valparaiso, Indiana.
[00:46:58.278 --> 00:47:11.101]  And the other night a woman brought in a young man about 17 years old in his own wheelchair and he was in the exact same state as Terry was in.
[00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:16.041]  And I got kind of interested in it and I started talking to her.
[00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:19.282]  And I asked her what she thinks about what's going on down in Florida.
[00:47:20.854 --> 00:47:26.096]  And her response was, I think that that's a travesty.
[00:47:26.096 --> 00:47:33.298]  And she says, I noticed that they haven't been working with her either because of her limbs and the position of her body and everything.
[00:47:33.298 --> 00:47:39.500]  And I explained to her that, yeah, I understand that her husband won't let her rehab.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.281]  And she said one telling thing at the end.
[00:47:43.281 --> 00:47:48.383]  She says, things like that aren't supposed to happen in this country.
[00:47:51.317 --> 00:47:55.360]  But it's a new loving thing we do, not helping people.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.341]  It's a new value.
[00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:58.702]  Wesley comments?
[00:47:58.702 --> 00:48:01.104]  Well, I think that's correct.
[00:48:01.104 --> 00:48:12.553]  People like this beautiful woman who want to care for her son, they know that these disabled people are not just, quote, vegetables, close quote, which is a term we should never use to describe a human being.
[00:48:12.553 --> 00:48:16.416]  The people who can't see their value are people with elite attitudes,
[00:48:17.032 --> 00:48:21.275]  Or people who may have a stake in somebody dying.
[00:48:21.275 --> 00:48:25.259]  I applaud this woman, and it's true.
[00:48:25.259 --> 00:48:35.947]  Michael has not let Terry have rehab since 1993, and when the parents said, before you take away feeding tubes, can she at least have rehab, Judge Greer said no.
[00:48:35.947 --> 00:48:42.232]  Well, Mr. Shaw will better hope she never comes out of it, because somebody might get in some trouble if she ever starts talking.
[00:48:42.975 --> 00:48:47.497]  Well, there's been speculation to that effect, and I won't comment on it.
[00:48:47.497 --> 00:48:51.759]  I do think that what he's doing right now is a form of abuse.
[00:48:51.759 --> 00:48:54.200]  It is very abusive, and that's the funny thing.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.761]  Why isn't the protective families people involved?
[00:48:56.761 --> 00:48:59.602]  They've been called in.
[00:48:59.602 --> 00:49:02.963]  A lot of us were pounding on the drum for them to come in much earlier.
[00:49:02.963 --> 00:49:05.184]  They came in finally only after
[00:49:06.058 --> 00:49:11.945]  You know, the thing kind of reached its end, and the Judge Greer refused to stop things so they could do an investigation.
[00:49:11.945 --> 00:49:14.908]  They should have been investigating this a year or two ago.
[00:49:14.908 --> 00:49:18.352]  But certain things are state and government sponsored, so they're okay.
[00:49:19.179 --> 00:49:19.680]  All right.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.222]  Don, anything else?
[00:49:21.222 --> 00:49:22.644]  That's it, sir.
[00:49:22.644 --> 00:49:23.024]  Thank you.
[00:49:23.024 --> 00:49:23.865]  God bless you.
[00:49:23.865 --> 00:49:26.208]  Leslie Smith, I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[00:49:26.208 --> 00:49:27.670]  Alex, thank you very much.
[00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:28.771]  Always good having you on.
[00:49:28.771 --> 00:49:30.954]  The new film, Martial Law, is out.
[00:49:30.954 --> 00:49:33.037]  Visit InfoWars.com for details.
[00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:36.902]  We'll come back, talk to Dave and Roger, then we'll go to our next guest, talk about the border war.
