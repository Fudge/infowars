[00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:06.305]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.047]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:09.848]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.309]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.951]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:17.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:21.898]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:41.268]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:43.790]  It is the ninth day of November 2005.
[00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.453]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:56.760]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we've got the rector who gave a little sermon at a church in Southern California.
[00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:58.496]  I think we're good to go.
[00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:20.104]  Coming on, Madison is a former U.S.
[00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:25.885]  Naval officer who was assigned to the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration.
[00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:31.627]  He also has some 20 years experience in computer security and data privacy.
[00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:41.710]  He has also worked for the Naval Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Sciences Corporation.
[00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.911]  We'll be talking about 9-11 with us.
[00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:44.771]  We'll also get into the
[00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:58.119]  French riots that even spread into some neighboring countries that are now into their 13th, almost 14th day, but are starting to burn themselves out literally and figuratively, thank God, but still very, very serious.
[00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:02.537]  And we'll also get into the indictments.
[00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:04.118]  Where is that going?
[00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:06.180]  That's kind of gone off the radar screen.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.945]  All the people that said that Bush and Cheney were indicted, and Barbara Olson had been nabbed, and all of this had happened.
[00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:13.386]  Why?
[00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:15.167]  We were going to get to the bottom of it.
[00:02:15.788 --> 00:02:22.253]  Well, now we haven't gotten to the bottom of it, so we'll be discussing that as well with Wayne Madison, who's just done a great job reporting on a host of issues.
[00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:27.798]  Also, oil company executives right now, right now, are...
[00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:29.226]  We're good to go.
[00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:49.772]  We're good to go.
[00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:50.072]  I think?
[00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:19.978]  There is just so much news here, and some good news concerning the election in the different states around the country yesterday, and some very bad news.
[00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:27.464]  Ah, but a program note for our Central Texas listeners, and for those that may be listening right now, you know, I fight the New World Order.
[00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:30.827]  I have been physically attacked in a parking lot before.
[00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:39.894]  I am not afraid, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm just deciding what to do with a phone call I got that was a clear threat last night.
[00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:52.909]  And I'm getting it transferred off my cell phone and recorded, and of course it's done skillfully as people do things like that, that basically if I don't shut up, they're going to come down here to my office and I'm a bleepin' bleeper.
[00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:55.459]  And, you know, I always love it.
[00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:56.760]  It's like the New World Order.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.902]  They dish all this out on us and do all this stuff to us.
[00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:02.123]  Years of attacks and the rest of it.
[00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:03.504]  And then we fight the New World Order.
[00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:04.585]  They get really upset.
[00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:07.927]  Well, it's the same thing with just little minions out there.
[00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:12.010]  They can't stand it when somebody gets sick of being attacked.
[00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.131]  You see, I have an impeccable record.
[00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:14.912]  I'm a nice guy.
[00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:15.832]  I leave everybody alone.
[00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:21.456]  And I've had just about enough of people trying to push me around and saying things about me that aren't true.
[00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.097]  And I haven't even taken the gloves off yet.
[00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:27.039]  So you just go ahead and you push and you do whatever you want.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.961]  By the way, I'm sitting right here.
[00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:31.682]  And I've got a right to defend myself.
[00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:32.563]  And I will.
[00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:35.505]  I'm sitting right here, right now.
[00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:39.388]  What a joke!
[00:04:40.288 --> 00:04:45.732]  You may find a bunch of cowards out there you can push around, but you can't push Alexander Emmerich Jones around.
[00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:47.853]  Unbelievable.
[00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:50.255]  So you go cry wolf somewhere else and you...
[00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:54.869]  You can huff and you can puff, but you're not going to blow this house down.
[00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:05.072]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:07.032]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:12.974]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:18.455]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:22.959]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:26.903]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.163 --> 00:05:31.808]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:38.154]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.194 --> 00:05:40.036]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:42.578]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:46.942]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:49.064]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:54.209]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:56.291]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:58.033]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.315]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.091]  Hello, folks.
[00:06:02.192 --> 00:06:03.092]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.232 --> 00:06:07.355]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.357]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:17.161]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:20.343]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.544 --> 00:06:22.945]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:28.729]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethods,
[00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:29.429]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:52.719]  803-4438.
[00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:53.079]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.061]  Or order on the web
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.881]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:13.483]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:07:13.903 --> 00:07:16.903]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.224]  Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[00:07:19.484 --> 00:07:24.225]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[00:07:24.605 --> 00:07:25.445]  That's 50% off the regular price.
[00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.133]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.895]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.722 --> 00:08:32.727]  All right, 8 minutes, 27 seconds into this first hour coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:39.109]  Rector J. Edwin Bacon of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, California.
[00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:46.533]  He even prefaced his little speech, his sermon, with, I'm not saying vote for John Kerry or vote for George Bush.
[00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:51.514]  They're both lordly men, which I totally disagree with, and I'll tell him that when he gets on.
[00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:53.594]  But the war is wrong.
[00:08:53.654 --> 00:08:55.435]  See, even not need.
[00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:58.955]  I'm not, as a preacher, supposed to be able to tell you I'm against this war.
[00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:01.016]  I'm not supposed to be able to have an opinion about anything.
[00:09:01.716 --> 00:09:03.056]  But the war is bad.
[00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.437]  Oh, the IRS is coming down on you.
[00:09:05.797 --> 00:09:07.397]  Where is the First Amendment?
[00:09:07.437 --> 00:09:13.279]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:13.939]  So that's coming up.
[00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:22.120]  And then Wayne Madison, who worked with the Navy at the National Security Agency on a host of important issues, coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.641]  I really look forward to that.
[00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:32.508]  Now, there's a lot of good news today and a lot of bad news, but let's go ahead and go into some of the good news.
[00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:35.469]  French rioting eases.
[00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:39.331]  You can call it easing as car burnings fall.
[00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:48.434]  France's storm of rioting and dousing people with gasoline and setting them on fire and killing people, that's in the French newspaper's video of it, but they like to keep it quiet over here.
[00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:49.374]  Side issue, but...
[00:09:50.143 --> 00:10:10.495]  Francis Storm of rioting eased Wednesday with car burnings falling nearly by half, police said, but looters and vandals defied a state of emergencies with attacks on super stores, a newspaper warehouse, and a subway station.
[00:10:11.296 --> 00:10:11.836]  So, uh...
[00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:16.686]  They defied the state of emergency and went out and torched some of the corporate institutions.
[00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:23.396]  I guess they've moved on from the nurseries and elementary schools and pulling people out of cars and pouring gasoline on them because they're white.
[00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:25.458]  And there's no way to defend that, folks.
[00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:27.541]  I mean, if the Klan was out doing this, I'd decry it.
[00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:30.045]  When they dragged that old black man to death in Jasper.
[00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:31.628]  I decried it.
[00:10:32.108 --> 00:10:33.689]  And they knew him, by the way.
[00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:34.569]  I'm not defending what they did.
[00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:37.470]  It was horrible, white trash, scum behavior.
[00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.031]  But he'd been one of the leaders of a black gang in the prison that they'd been in.
[00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:43.611]  So it was a gang war thing.
[00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:45.311]  A racial gang war thing.
[00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:50.253]  The product of our wonderful prisons that are factories for this, for the New World Order.
[00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:55.994]  But just dragging innocent women around, setting them on fire is really out of control.
[00:10:56.883 --> 00:11:18.753]  The extraordinary 12-day state of emergency which began at midnight Tuesday covered Paris, its suburbs, and more than 30 other French cities, from the Mediterranean to the border with Germany, and to Rowan in the north, and an indication of how widespread arson, riots, and other unrest has become in nearly two weeks of violence going into 14 days, or two full weeks here in just a few hours.
[00:11:19.193 --> 00:11:29.123]  The unrest began October 27th and has grown into a nationwide insurrection by disillusioned suburb youths who complain of discrimination and unemployment.
[00:11:29.463 --> 00:11:37.550]  Although many of the French-born children of Arab and black African immigrants are Muslim, police say the violence is not being driven by Islamic groups.
[00:11:37.671 --> 00:11:38.952]  And I'm a tooth fairy.
[00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:56.622]  The emergency decree invoked a 50-year-old security law that dates to French colonial war in Algeria that empowers officials to put troublemakers under house arrest, ban or limit the movement of people and vehicles, confiscate weapons, and close public spaces where gangs gather.
[00:11:58.643 --> 00:12:01.025]  Now, I don't want to spend all day on this.
[00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:04.027]  I spent probably 30 minutes on it yesterday, but this is important.
[00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:07.849]  This will be used to bring in a greater police state
[00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:19.698]  The poor gangs of predominantly black Africans and some Muslims and some whites aren't going to get any, quote, freedom or any economic development from this.
[00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:27.824]  It's going to create more division between the western Frenchmen and the transplanted third world populations.
[00:12:27.844 --> 00:12:32.989]  It's going to cause more actual discrimination against them, which we do know goes on, and they discriminate right back.
[00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:33.909]  This is tribalism.
[00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.571]  This is how it works.
[00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:38.353]  This is why it's such a great tool for the globalists.
[00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:39.679]  And watch.
[00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:48.403]  France is already saying, it wasn't hard to predict this last week, that, oh, no, there's not going to be cuts on our massive record immigration, both illegal and legal.
[00:12:48.423 --> 00:12:50.924]  We're just going to bring anybody in who wants to come in from the third world.
[00:12:51.424 --> 00:12:53.125]  It's not the wonderful immigrants' fault.
[00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:58.907]  It's not the fault that we've got such an imbalance in people who have not been assimilated.
[00:12:59.147 --> 00:13:02.248]  We're just going to keep it at the current explosive growth levels.
[00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:04.169]  So now they're saying that.
[00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:08.774]  Why, to prove our goodwill towards the third world, we'll intensify.
[00:13:09.114 --> 00:13:12.257]  That's because this is exactly what the globalists want.
[00:13:13.298 --> 00:13:14.559]  This is exactly their plan.
[00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:16.340]  Same thing here, folks.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.201]  Look at the economy.
[00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:18.302]  Look what's happened to the crime rate.
[00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:24.687]  Look what's happened just to a score of indices, indicators, with the open borders in this country.
[00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:34.415]  The 3 million illegals, that's conservatives that come in a year, the 1,200,000 illegals that come in a year, that's 4 million, plus...
[00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:36.576]  We cannot assimilate.
[00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:39.337]  Our own government, our own media tells them, don't assimilate.
[00:13:39.357 --> 00:13:46.302]  See, and then these groups go out and torch buildings and have riots, and they claim they're attacking the corporate structure.
[00:13:47.102 --> 00:13:49.304]  But the corporate structure is funding what they're doing.
[00:13:49.524 --> 00:13:52.286]  The international corporations are bigger than the nation state.
[00:13:52.546 --> 00:13:58.690]  They are using racial warfare and ethnic strife to shut down the nation state, to bring it down.
[00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.252]  The globalists are threatened by anything pure and strong.
[00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:07.004]  The globalists are threatened by anyone who stands up for themselves.
[00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.706]  The globalists are threatened by that.
[00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:12.429]  They're threatened by strength.
[00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:15.571]  They're threatened by countries they can't bully.
[00:14:16.132 --> 00:14:19.054]  Bullies want little chicken necks they can push around.
[00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:21.656]  When somebody finally stands up to them, they don't like it.
[00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:23.357]  And they bluster it first.
[00:14:24.038 --> 00:14:26.780]  But once you punch the collective police state in the nose, it crumbles.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.641]  It crumbles.
[00:14:30.326 --> 00:14:32.987]  And so the answer will be in France and even greater police state.
[00:14:33.147 --> 00:14:34.468]  All done by design.
[00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:40.650]  Now, that's enough on the situation with France.
[00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.911]  Here is the good news today.
[00:14:43.732 --> 00:14:47.473]  Federal hate bill now virtually dead.
[00:14:50.334 --> 00:14:55.276]  Senator Frist says he won't let Senator Kennedy reintroduce it.
[00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:56.517]  Now, a year ago...
[00:14:57.463 --> 00:15:03.312]  When Frist had first got in as the majority leader of the Senate, he was pro-thought crime mind control bill.
[00:15:03.933 --> 00:15:06.217]  But then because of protesting, he became neutral.
[00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:08.841]  And now he's saying he is against it.
[00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:11.205]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:16.027]  It shows that the majority of Americans support the First Amendment.
[00:15:16.047 --> 00:15:18.529]  And I don't care what poster child they trot out.
[00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:24.294]  Some racist Klan guy saying kill all the blacks, or some racist black doctor saying kill all the whites.
[00:15:24.954 --> 00:15:25.635]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:25.735 --> 00:15:26.836]  Let the scum say that.
[00:15:26.876 --> 00:15:27.897]  They try to follow it.
[00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.298]  They try to act on it.
[00:15:29.658 --> 00:15:30.699]  They need to be dealt with.
[00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:32.560]  And they need to be stood up against.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.203]  These bullies need to be stood up against until we're not going to put up with them.
[00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:40.861]  And we need to stand up against the media and go, hey, we're going to decry all of the racism.
[00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:44.263]  Whether it's from the black racists, the white racists, the Zionist racists.
[00:15:44.723 --> 00:15:48.485]  You know, far too long groups like that have gotten a pass.
[00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:50.726]  And you're not going to get a pass anymore.
[00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:54.548]  Federal hate bill now virtually dead.
[00:15:54.568 --> 00:15:56.689]  This is from Reverend Ted Pike with excellent analysis.
[00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.752]  All of this good news is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, by the way.
[00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:03.273]  Your news leaders in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:12.974]  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's office told me that although Senator Edward Kennedy has vowed to force a vote in the Senate attached to his anti-hate bill...
[00:16:13.849 --> 00:16:24.292]  That's 1145, but the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, again, has nothing to do with that, but they tagged it on so people heard the bill name and thought, why, you're against that?
[00:16:24.772 --> 00:16:25.892]  You're for sex offenders?
[00:16:26.433 --> 00:16:27.233]  Had nothing to do with it.
[00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:34.955]  It would federalize all the counties and cities under federal hate crime control and prosecute people if they, quote, hurt somebody's feelings.
[00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:36.076]  We're good to go.
[00:16:59.222 --> 00:17:02.264]  Frist said that he will not give Kennedy such an opportunity.
[00:17:02.304 --> 00:17:06.687]  The House of Representatives on September 14th passed the House version of Kennedy's bill, H.R.
[00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:06.687]  2662.
[00:17:08.247 --> 00:17:09.188]  Again, the House did that.
[00:17:09.668 --> 00:17:12.530]  As a rider to the Children's Safety Act, H.R.
[00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.530]  3132.
[00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:20.835]  Yet Frist is under no obligation to bring the Senate version of the Child's Safety Act, S.1086, to a vote.
[00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:25.517]  This effectively kills the hate bill's chances of passing in Congress this year.
[00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:26.378]  And I would add,
[00:17:27.697 --> 00:17:35.902]  It signals a major shift in the leadership of the Republican Party towards at least publicly saying they're not for this.
[00:17:36.202 --> 00:17:38.704]  Something we haven't been able to get out of them in the last seven years.
[00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:45.888]  Seven years ago they shifted from being against hate crimes laws to being, quote, for them.
[00:17:45.928 --> 00:17:49.170]  And now we're getting signals that they're no longer going to support them.
[00:17:49.991 --> 00:17:53.233]  So we are literally battering this creature back under the rock.
[00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:55.568]  I commend you out there.
[00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:56.609]  This is great news.
[00:17:57.089 --> 00:17:59.011]  Here's more good news.
[00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:20.070]  Schwarzenegger pinned everything on getting laws passed that would restrict the voting rights of the people, that would put in police state powers and centralization powers over the California legislature, that would give party leaders more control, that would just allow all sorts of subterfuge and rewriting of current political lines
[00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:22.863]  It went down in flames.
[00:18:22.923 --> 00:18:24.283]  His initiatives, period.
[00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:25.044]  There were many of them.
[00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.725]  Went down in flames in a stinging rebuke.
[00:18:27.745 --> 00:18:28.445]  This is AP.
[00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:30.526]  Voters reject Schwarzenegger initiatives.
[00:18:30.846 --> 00:18:44.332]  In a stinging rebuke from voters who elected him two years ago, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's efforts to reshape state government were rejected during a special election that darkened his prospects for a second term.
[00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:49.674]  The Republican governor and former Hollywood actor who likes to say he can sell anything...
[00:18:50.482 --> 00:18:54.906]  On Tuesday, saw all four of his signature ballot proposals rejected.
[00:18:56.227 --> 00:19:05.695]  Magically, he did win on a lot of the special Diebold machines, but in other areas, it was so overwhelmingly against those special machines, and we have the numbers coming in on those, that it was still defeated.
[00:19:06.056 --> 00:19:12.581]  You see, only 35% roughly of the country has them in now, and that's about the number around 30-something percent in California.
[00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:13.382]  I saw a year ago.
[00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.162]  I know it's more now.
[00:19:14.763 --> 00:19:15.644]  And it just didn't work for you.
[00:19:15.664 --> 00:19:17.005]  You've got to have all those machines, Arnold.
[00:19:18.146 --> 00:19:27.791]  The election pitted the once-dominant Republican governor against two of California powerhouse political forces, public employee unions and Democrats who control the legislature.
[00:19:28.431 --> 00:19:39.496]  The unions spent millions of dollars to beat Schwarzenegger's propositions to limit the use of their members' dues to political purposes, cap Senate spending, redraw legislative districts, and restrict public school teacher tenure.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.424]  It was a sobering evening for a man once considered among the most popular politicians in America.
[00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:55.753]  And I'd like to say, you the listeners at ArnoldExposed.com, I think we're a good part, maybe 5% or more, of putting nails in the coffin of Schwarzenegger's political future.
[00:19:56.213 --> 00:19:57.254]  But he's not dead yet.
[00:19:57.374 --> 00:19:58.695]  This boy's got seven lives.
[00:19:58.995 --> 00:19:59.456]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.777 --> 00:20:04.378]  Government is best with government leads.
[00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:06.240]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.362]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:12.485]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:19.390]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:20:29.378 --> 00:20:30.318]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:21:01.807 --> 00:21:12.532]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:12.712 --> 00:21:20.276]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:20.556 --> 00:21:23.697]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:23.957 --> 00:21:29.680]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:21:31.161 --> 00:21:36.145]  The material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:40.389]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:42.350]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:48.495]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:48.696 --> 00:21:52.419]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:22:00.684 --> 00:22:04.624]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:05.025 --> 00:22:10.506]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:11.066 --> 00:22:11.566]  That's right.
[00:22:11.886 --> 00:22:14.166]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:21.648]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:29.914]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:30.354 --> 00:22:35.218]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.838 --> 00:22:38.860]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.462 --> 00:22:41.883]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.628 --> 00:23:06.992]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[00:23:07.453 --> 00:23:13.919]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[00:23:14.403 --> 00:23:16.543]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:22.985]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[00:23:23.525 --> 00:23:42.868]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversy surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[00:23:52.815 --> 00:23:53.155]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:20.423]  That's right, waging war on corruption, crashing into the lies and disinformation, never backing down to the New World Order and all their pimps and all their poms and all their little minions.
[00:24:22.024 --> 00:24:28.445]  But Schwarzenegger's initiatives, even the way that they were opposed to the public, are horrible.
[00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:32.266]  And they really didn't do anything to help anybody.
[00:24:34.952 --> 00:24:42.938]  Of his four initiatives, the one about school teacher tenure, I think that that's the one that had the most merit.
[00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:43.578]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:24:43.618 --> 00:24:47.161]  The other stuff he was doing was so horrible, that was just a smokescreen for it.
[00:24:48.314 --> 00:24:49.495]  That was just a smokescreen.
[00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:52.096]  And I did look at California tenure for school teachers.
[00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:56.119]  I mean, I believe the whole public school system itself is a fraud and hurts children, hurts teachers.
[00:24:56.179 --> 00:24:57.620]  It's all, you know, federal curriculum.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.361]  So I believe it should all be scrapped right now.
[00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:01.662]  Nobody should be in public schools.
[00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:02.903]  And that's not an attack on the teachers.
[00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:06.485]  But the only facet to, again, his four initiatives was that.
[00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:10.327]  And there are ways to get rid of teachers if there is a problem in California.
[00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:16.731]  So, really, that was another red herring, just a piggyback in a kind of a coattail
[00:25:17.722 --> 00:25:19.663]  His entire program onto it.
[00:25:20.983 --> 00:25:22.363]  Some bad things happening.
[00:25:22.443 --> 00:25:28.265]  Overall, Republican governors have been better on the Second Amendment and a few issues than Democrats.
[00:25:29.145 --> 00:25:33.626]  And Democrats have been winning elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and California.
[00:25:33.966 --> 00:25:36.207]  And Virginia is a major swing state, as you know.
[00:25:36.227 --> 00:25:37.567]  It goes both ways.
[00:25:38.526 --> 00:25:46.369]  Whereas New Jersey and California are historically predominantly Democrat, and Democrats also held on to key seats they already had.
[00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:54.973]  So that's reversing a 10-year trend of seats going to Republicans at the state, federal, and local level.
[00:25:55.493 --> 00:25:56.754]  For that matter, county level.
[00:25:57.054 --> 00:25:58.735]  But this was state elections nationwide.
[00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:16.686]  And so what we're going to have is an engineered backlash where we will lose good Republican seats of people that are a little bit better than Democrats, all because Bush is such a horrible, traitorous, gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, tax-and-spend corporate shill.
[00:26:17.266 --> 00:26:19.687]  And he's designed to bring the Democrats in en masse.
[00:26:19.727 --> 00:26:22.169]  So, Republicans, you can celebrate that
[00:26:23.203 --> 00:26:23.923]  All day long.
[00:26:24.224 --> 00:26:32.008]  The Republicans have the House, the Senate, so they've got the Legislative, they've got most of the federal judgeships, seven of the nine Supreme Court.
[00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:34.469]  Excuse me, they're about to have eight of the nine.
[00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:37.691]  Excuse me, eight of the nine appointees will be Republican appointees.
[00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:39.912]  Boy, those numbers are really shifting.
[00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:44.780]  No, it'll be 7 of the 9.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.422]  I've got to look at that.
[00:26:47.162 --> 00:26:50.045]  But the point is that they've got all three branches of government.
[00:26:50.065 --> 00:26:54.329]  They've got most of the governorships, most of the legislatures.
[00:26:54.889 --> 00:26:55.670]  And what are we seeing?
[00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:56.831]  The age of police state.
[00:26:56.871 --> 00:26:57.912]  The age of big government.
[00:26:57.932 --> 00:26:59.974]  The age of loss of freedoms.
[00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:02.716]  There is some more good news, though.
[00:27:02.736 --> 00:27:05.479]  The Pentagon is not going along with Bush...
[00:27:06.508 --> 00:27:15.811]  Just because they're facing so many lawsuits and so many problems and so many foreign bases being closed to them, they're at least publicly having to say that they're against torture.
[00:27:16.391 --> 00:27:25.114]  Of course, they've got former Soviet gulags all over the Eastern Bloc where they're torturing people, and we've got you, we're going to torture you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:27:25.714 --> 00:27:30.376]  That's what they're saying, but Pentagon, at least publicly, explicitly bans detainee torture.
[00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:33.537]  So the people carrying out the torture now know they're not going to be protected.
[00:27:34.077 --> 00:27:37.821]  The Pentagon, scrutinized over treatment of detainees held by U.S.
[00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:46.530]  military, explicitly bars torture and prohibits the use of dogs to intimidate prisoners in a new interrogation policy directive made public on Tuesday.
[00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.132]  Of course, we know what policy they're really following.
[00:27:49.192 --> 00:27:53.677]  Copper Green, from 1970, without a table.
[00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:57.541]  When I strap somebody to a table, you turn vertical and then you...
[00:27:58.698 --> 00:28:03.239]  You lift him into a large bucket of water or a bathtub.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.961]  Well, normally it's urine and feces, but we'll just say liquid.
[00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:11.722]  Until you start suffocating over and over again, and he'll say whatever they want.
[00:28:12.522 --> 00:28:19.145]  You'll say that you are Beelzebub himself or Rumpelstiltskin.
[00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:20.305]  It doesn't really matter.
[00:28:20.425 --> 00:28:22.326]  And, of course, you can't trust a government that tortures.
[00:28:22.506 --> 00:28:25.567]  You can't believe intelligence from people who've been tortured.
[00:28:25.587 --> 00:28:26.487]  History just shows that.
[00:28:27.805 --> 00:28:33.107]  But the Pentagon is at least explicitly now having to, quote, reverse course and ban detainee torture.
[00:28:33.127 --> 00:28:40.710]  They tried to say, oh, we can do some pressuring, but if we're pressuring somebody and they die, and we didn't mean to kill them, then it's not even torture.
[00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.871]  So killing someone, you torture them so bad, isn't torture.
[00:28:44.091 --> 00:28:46.872]  So that's what Bush meant two days ago when he said, we don't torture.
[00:28:47.293 --> 00:28:48.173]  We've never tortured.
[00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:49.353]  I think we're good to go.
[00:29:09.444 --> 00:29:12.126]  And that they control reality, perception is reality.
[00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:22.154]  Well, when you figure out that it is a projection, and that it is a fraud, and that it is an illusion, and you consciously realize that, then you do not control reality.
[00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:23.956]  So you're delusional.
[00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:25.657]  You've bought your own hype.
[00:29:26.738 --> 00:29:36.746]  And again, arrogant bullies and big mouths and control freaks and despots are never able to figure that out.
[00:29:37.463 --> 00:29:39.704]  They're never able to understand that.
[00:29:39.784 --> 00:29:44.326]  Well, here is the news flash, so I hope you enjoy it.
[00:29:45.246 --> 00:29:46.807]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:47.527]  Please stay with us.
[00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:52.729]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.850]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.383]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[00:30:03.443 --> 00:30:06.326]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:30:06.507 --> 00:30:11.894]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:30:12.134 --> 00:30:13.656]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:30:13.696 --> 00:30:15.959]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:19.624]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:30:19.824 --> 00:30:20.584]  We're good to go.
[00:30:42.697 --> 00:30:45.658]  Order the book and DVD now for one low price.

[00:30:51.019 --> 00:30:52.500]  Tell them you heard it on GCN.
[00:31:02.209 --> 00:31:05.773]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.813 --> 00:31:06.333]  are located?
[00:31:06.534 --> 00:31:09.917]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.137 --> 00:31:14.862]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.122 --> 00:31:20.147]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.387 --> 00:31:20.967]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.781]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:04.216]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.476 --> 00:32:08.298]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:09.439]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:14.002]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:14.222 --> 00:32:18.405]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.785 --> 00:32:23.648]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:24.028 --> 00:32:27.591]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:27.811 --> 00:32:33.155]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:33.415 --> 00:32:36.157]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:36.458 --> 00:32:37.358]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:48.387]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:15.311]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:16.092]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:16.132 --> 00:33:17.212]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:17.232 --> 00:33:19.052]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:19.092 --> 00:33:20.772]  We're about to go to a very special guest.
[00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:28.174]  The rector at a major Episcopal church who has the thought police trying to tell him what he can and can't say.
[00:33:28.474 --> 00:33:29.774]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:30.194 --> 00:33:36.035]  Don't forget that coming up in this holiday season, I have slashed the prices on my documentary films.
[00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:39.376]  Some of my DVDs, some of my films are as low as $5.95 apiece.
[00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:46.040]  When you get multiple copies, because I want to get them out to your friends and family, your neighbors, your churches.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:51.224]  We need to educate people about the tyranny that's coming down in this country from both political parties.
[00:33:51.244 --> 00:33:53.606]  They're bought and paid for by the same political interests.
[00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.831]  It's very serious enslavement.
[00:34:24.907 --> 00:34:25.548]  We're good to go.
[00:34:42.228 --> 00:34:42.969]  What's the discount?
[00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.572]  If you want to give these as gifts to your whole family, this is the one place to do it.
[00:34:46.592 --> 00:34:48.014]  There's dozens and dozens of things.
[00:34:49.075 --> 00:34:54.900]  Normally, $320.40, now $179 for everything we've produced.
[00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:58.163]  I mean, that is just a gigantic discount.
[00:34:58.684 --> 00:34:59.805]  A savings of over $140.
[00:35:00.005 --> 00:35:03.668]  And, of course, we've got individual savings, too.
[00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:06.171]  And we're carrying the new book, Codex Magica.
[00:35:07.075 --> 00:35:09.396]  We're exposing all these weird secret societies.
[00:35:09.956 --> 00:35:14.097]  We're carrying the book, The Coming Battle, written in 1898 about the Federal Reserve System.
[00:35:14.377 --> 00:35:20.278]  We're really expanding what we're doing in the online bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:21.479 --> 00:35:26.460]  That's I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S dot com to order via the safe, secure online video and bookstore.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.301]  Or call toll free and they can answer all your questions as well and tell you about the different specials.
[00:35:30.321 --> 00:35:30.901]  And that's 1-
[00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:32.236]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:32.556]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:36.941]  Or, last but not least, just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:36.981 --> 00:35:37.701]  Let's go to our guest.
[00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.744]  And I'm, again, very honored to have our guest on with us.
[00:35:59.784 --> 00:36:02.726]  Let me just first read a paragraph out of the LA Times.
[00:36:02.746 --> 00:36:08.810]  And there's an accompanying article about conservatives angry at IRS warnings as well.
[00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.352]  But anti-war sermon brings IRS warning.
[00:36:12.713 --> 00:36:19.677]  All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena risk losing its tax-exempt status because of a former rector's remarks in 2004.
[00:36:20.818 --> 00:36:34.323]  The Internal Revenue Service, now the Commissariat Thought Police, has warned one of Southern California's largest and most liberal churches that it is a risk of losing its taxes and status because of anti-war sermon two days before the 2004 presidential election.
[00:36:34.823 --> 00:36:47.627]  Rector J. Edwin Bacon of All Saints Episcopal Church of Pasadena told many congregants during morning services Sunday that a guest sermon by the church's former rector, Reverend George F.
[00:36:48.553 --> 00:36:56.258]  Regis, on October 31st of 2004, had prompted a letter from the IRS.
[00:36:56.278 --> 00:37:00.441]  And folks, you need to understand that the LA Times got a copy of the sermon.
[00:37:01.162 --> 00:37:04.464]  And the sermon, and we're going to go to our guest here in a moment to talk about this.
[00:37:05.766 --> 00:37:09.208]  Simply said, now listen, I'm not saying vote for Kerry or vote for Bush.
[00:37:09.228 --> 00:37:12.610]  They're both very lordly men, which I disagree with.
[00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:13.971]  Both of them are horrid.
[00:37:13.991 --> 00:37:15.291]  But that's my opinion.
[00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:15.852]  I'm glad to have it.
[00:37:16.272 --> 00:37:17.833]  At least for now in this so-called free country.
[00:37:18.913 --> 00:37:19.974]  But this war is evil.
[00:37:20.014 --> 00:37:20.794]  This war is a fraud.
[00:37:20.814 --> 00:37:27.478]  Well, folks, the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:37:27.938 --> 00:37:34.242]  What separation of church and state is, and that was just an idea, but I tend to agree with it, from Thomas Jefferson,
[00:37:34.992 --> 00:37:36.575]  It's a letter, folks.
[00:37:36.775 --> 00:37:38.058]  We don't have a Church of England.
[00:37:38.098 --> 00:37:40.121]  We don't have the government saying this is the one church.
[00:37:40.442 --> 00:37:42.024]  If you don't follow, it will cut your head off.
[00:37:43.006 --> 00:37:43.307]  Okay?
[00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:48.929]  And it's totally turned around where, no, no, no, preachers, you don't say you're against abortion.
[00:37:48.949 --> 00:37:51.130]  Preachers, you don't say you're against open borders.
[00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.811]  You don't say you're against gun control.
[00:37:53.051 --> 00:37:54.352]  You don't say you're for gun control.
[00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.353]  You don't say you're for the UN or against it.
[00:37:56.593 --> 00:37:58.934]  You don't say you're for communism or you're against communism.
[00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:01.516]  Folks, it's called the First Amendment.
[00:38:01.756 --> 00:38:05.938]  Preachers have got it, and I've got it, and there shouldn't be any tax exemption system because...
[00:38:06.518 --> 00:38:15.864]  They shouldn't be paying taxes to begin with because Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:38:15.884 --> 00:38:17.485]  Alright, he's been holding for five minutes.
[00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:20.868]  I apologize about that, but I had to preface this about this outrage.
[00:38:21.528 --> 00:38:24.230]  And I believe we have Rector J. Edwin Bacon on.
[00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.350]  Sir, are you there?
[00:38:25.611 --> 00:38:26.031]  Yes, I am.
[00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.633]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:30.235]  This is preposterous.
[00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:32.819]  Do you agree with the statements I've made, or would you like to add to them?
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:41.712]  Well, what I would say is that if the IRS position is allowed to stand, it is going to have a chilling effect on freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
[00:38:42.452 --> 00:38:49.576]  It is going to have a very chilling effect on the freedom of the pulpit in the US.
[00:38:49.736 --> 00:39:06.905]  We are going to continue to do what we've always done and that is to speak truth to power and bring the core values of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bear on our own personal lives, interpersonal lives, but also on the political scene.
[00:39:07.955 --> 00:39:17.443]  We will continue to ask our president and anybody else who's in power to make the world as it is the way God wants it to be.
[00:39:18.084 --> 00:39:22.288]  And that will mean that we will always have something to say about political issues.
[00:39:23.108 --> 00:39:27.292]  And the IRS will simply have to do what they're going to do.
[00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:32.917]  But the incredible thing is the individual you had there giving a sermon, a guest sermon,
[00:39:34.234 --> 00:39:36.336]  I mean, even their sermon is milquetoast.
[00:39:36.396 --> 00:39:39.679]  I think he shouldn't have prefaced it with, ooh, I'm not being political.
[00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:44.703]  I mean, there's a chilling effect right there, and the IRS says that's not enough.
[00:39:45.204 --> 00:39:48.166]  I mean, what, so we can't say we're against the war if we're preachers?
[00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:50.429]  Actually, he didn't apologize for that.
[00:39:50.729 --> 00:39:53.892]  The only thing he said was, I am not telling you who to vote for.
[00:39:54.572 --> 00:39:56.513]  But that's what I'm saying is it's still prefaced.
[00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:57.714]  He shouldn't have to preface that.
[00:39:57.914 --> 00:39:58.254]  You know what?
[00:39:58.294 --> 00:40:00.155]  You should be able to tell people who to vote for.
[00:40:00.575 --> 00:40:01.195]  I disagree.
[00:40:01.576 --> 00:40:07.678]  I think it's very important for churches and religious organizations to be non-partisan.
[00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:12.501]  That way we are free to stay focused on the issues and not on personalities.
[00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:14.802]  I stick with the First Amendment.
[00:40:14.842 --> 00:40:18.043]  I mean, I'm sure you heard me say it twice there earlier, how it begins.
[00:40:18.063 --> 00:40:25.227]  I mean, that's how our whole Bill of Rights begins, is Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the exercise of their own.
[00:40:25.427 --> 00:40:27.688]  You know, people 50 years ago said, oh, let's be reasonable.
[00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:29.749]  I mean, never before were our churches regulated.
[00:40:29.989 --> 00:40:32.691]  Oh, let's let them tell us not to be political.
[00:40:32.971 --> 00:40:35.192]  Preachers should be able to say anything they want to say.
[00:40:35.973 --> 00:40:39.937]  We should be able to say anything we want to say up to the point of endorsing candidates.
[00:40:40.477 --> 00:40:47.104]  We always ought to be able to say exactly what our core values are and bring them to bear on our own personal lives and our national lives.
[00:40:47.124 --> 00:40:54.251]  But sir, as you know, the Black Brigade that helped found this country, I mean, our war against the British was led by the pastors.
[00:40:56.934 --> 00:40:56.954]  I...
[00:40:58.251 --> 00:40:59.031]  I think that's fine.
[00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:07.956]  I think that over history it has proven that preachers are much freer if they don't endorse candidates for an election.
[00:41:08.276 --> 00:41:09.557]  But I say they're free, period.
[00:41:09.577 --> 00:41:15.600]  The government, see, incrementally tells us, well, you know, Pastor, 50 years ago they didn't tell the churches what they could and couldn't say.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.922]  They just said, oh, it's a formality, sign this little form for your tax exemption.
[00:41:19.122 --> 00:41:20.463]  You've always been tax exempt.
[00:41:20.483 --> 00:41:22.664]  I mean, how were you guys tax exempt 100 years ago?
[00:41:25.065 --> 00:41:27.747]  I really can't speak to the history of tax exemption.
[00:41:28.747 --> 00:41:38.074]  Well, you know, the 700 Club, they went after them a decade ago, and their tax exemption, and they had to divest some stations because of it, and I was against that when it happened.
[00:41:38.094 --> 00:41:44.399]  And they've gone after liberal churches, and it's just all balderdash, in my opinion.
[00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:46.021]  Should I call you rector or pastor?
[00:41:46.361 --> 00:41:47.382]  I'd rather you call me Ed.
[00:41:47.822 --> 00:41:48.503]  Okay, Ed.
[00:41:48.523 --> 00:41:49.824]  Well, I'm just trying to...
[00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:51.398]  I understand.
[00:41:51.438 --> 00:41:53.259]  You can call me Rector if you want to be formal.
[00:41:53.379 --> 00:41:53.799]  Sure, sure.
[00:41:53.819 --> 00:41:55.240]  I'm just trying to let folks know who we're talking to.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:55.400]  Sure.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.001]  Specifically, what do the IRS do?
[00:41:57.061 --> 00:41:58.241]  Why are you against what they're saying now?
[00:41:58.281 --> 00:42:04.244]  I mean, even with you trying to, I guess, be moderate in your views then, that's still not good enough for them?
[00:42:04.964 --> 00:42:05.585]  Apparently not.
[00:42:06.225 --> 00:42:14.709]  They are quite exercised over the fact that we had a preacher criticize the Bush administration during the campaign season.
[00:42:15.465 --> 00:42:32.055]  And their position is that had we preached that sermon some other time, in fact they've looked at all my sermons on the website, and they said if I had preached any of my sermons during that particular season, that that would have been an implicit endorsement of a candidate.
[00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:34.897]  That is simply not true.
[00:42:35.672 --> 00:42:40.396]  There was no way in which this guest preacher was endorsing a candidate.
[00:42:40.636 --> 00:42:42.197]  We have never endorsed candidates.
[00:42:42.538 --> 00:42:46.081]  We are so very consistent about that and very clear.
[00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:59.872]  But we are as bold as we are called to be to criticize war, to criticize poverty, and to call for economic justice and radical, inclusive love of God.
[00:43:00.553 --> 00:43:03.335]  And that made them quite nervous.
[00:43:04.002 --> 00:43:06.005]  Because it was done during the election season.
[00:43:07.748 --> 00:43:09.852]  Well, I mean, I've had the past years on.
[00:43:09.872 --> 00:43:13.137]  I've read countless news articles over the last 11 years I've been on the air.
[00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:14.840]  Or even longer.
[00:43:15.601 --> 00:43:16.702]  We're good to go.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.744]  They're already running around and trying to tell you guys what you can and can't do.
[00:43:45.124 --> 00:43:46.425]  And it's totally un-American.
[00:43:46.745 --> 00:43:49.067]  It is totally un-American and it's totally out of line.
[00:43:49.647 --> 00:43:52.929]  They have no right to come in and tell us that we cannot be political.
[00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:59.114]  The only thing that the tax law allows them to do is tell us that we cannot be partisan.
[00:44:00.514 --> 00:44:03.856]  But, sir, we had laws in this country that black people were two-thirds human.
[00:44:04.136 --> 00:44:06.877]  I say those laws are now in void to begin with.
[00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:12.359]  I'm not going to follow a law that says I've got to jump off a cliff, and I believe the law that you guys are even... See, that's the point.
[00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:21.102]  You try to follow an unconstitutional, abhorrent, anathema law that our founding fathers decried, the exact kind of stuff that the Church of England did...
[00:44:22.082 --> 00:44:26.844]  And then you guys try to follow this Boulder Dash law, and then boom!
[00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:28.205]  What happens?
[00:44:28.225 --> 00:44:29.646]  Then they even want more.
[00:44:30.546 --> 00:44:44.232]  That is a huge concern, and the American public should be quite upset about that, because we have been so very careful to adhere to what I consider to be a wise guideline.
[00:44:44.272 --> 00:44:47.394]  But Americans aren't supposed to be thinking about what they're about to say!
[00:44:51.237 --> 00:44:53.918]  I mean, I'm sorry to be ranting, Pastor Rector.
[00:44:53.938 --> 00:44:55.579]  I mean, it's just hard for me to deal with here.
[00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:56.519]  Can you explain that to me?
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:01.562]  Why we have to... I mean, I'm not a pastor, but the pastors I have on all the time have to think about what they're about to say?
[00:45:02.302 --> 00:45:07.484]  No, that's not what I... Well, now, it will be different if the IRS prevails.
[00:45:07.624 --> 00:45:08.425]  Yeah, let's be specific.
[00:45:08.465 --> 00:45:10.766]  What are they now trying to expand here?
[00:45:11.246 --> 00:45:19.550]  Their position is that we violated that one section of the IRS regulation against campaign intervention.
[00:45:20.766 --> 00:45:27.227]  If they, and of course we did not do that because we explicitly said we are not telling you how to vote.
[00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:47.712]  If they prevail and say that we implicitly did that, then we are very vulnerable and every other religious community is vulnerable and every other 501c3 non-governmental organization is vulnerable to the IRS coming in and using a subjective guideline to say that you implicitly
[00:45:48.723 --> 00:45:51.306]  Well, by the way, this works like clockwork.
[00:45:51.326 --> 00:45:54.169]  When Bill Clinton's in office, it's conservative churches that get persecuted.
[00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.032]  When George Bush is in office, it's liberal churches.
[00:45:56.392 --> 00:45:57.314]  But I did see in the L.A.
[00:45:57.334 --> 00:46:01.359]  Times that major conservative groups and churches are also against what they're doing to you guys.
[00:46:01.499 --> 00:46:02.480]  That is exactly right.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.145]  The conservatives and the liberals are together on this matter.
[00:46:08.053 --> 00:46:09.474]  You know, this is really scary, though.
[00:46:09.494 --> 00:46:16.099]  We have this commissariat of thought police stomping around.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:25.106]  So I guess they're saying if during an election you criticize an elected official, that that is campaigning.
[00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:26.768]  That is precisely what they're saying.
[00:46:27.108 --> 00:46:28.649]  And that is what is so dangerous.
[00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:36.035]  They are saying if you criticize a person who's in office, in season and out of season,
[00:46:36.976 --> 00:46:39.860]  Then you are in violation of the IRS regulations.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.283]  That simply is not true.
[00:46:43.845 --> 00:46:44.746]  But that is their claim.
[00:46:45.774 --> 00:46:50.758]  Well, there's a lot of people that claim, oh, all them liberal churches out there, they're commie front, shut them down.
[00:46:51.179 --> 00:46:57.244]  Folks, the point is, is that's the exact kind of stuff the communists would do, would be come in and shut down the churches.
[00:46:57.304 --> 00:47:01.648]  I've got them arresting people for sneaking Bibles into China today.
[00:47:01.668 --> 00:47:03.009]  I mean, they execute people for that.
[00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.171]  You know, I don't want to hear it, folks.
[00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:10.776]  Tyranny comes and all these different labels and all these different packages, and we have just got to fight this.
[00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:12.558]  We have got to say no to this.
[00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:14.480]  Where is this going?
[00:47:15.521 --> 00:47:17.003]  What are they doing to your church right now?
[00:47:18.124 --> 00:47:19.105]  We're in a waiting pattern.
[00:47:20.186 --> 00:47:34.282]  What has happened as a result of our going public with this this past Sunday is we have had phenomenal support coming our way from people who want to join our church, people who want to give to the Legal Defense Fund, people who are saying we want to do anything we can.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:43.722]  We are in actually a holding pattern waiting for them now to come back to us and tell us what the next level of inquiry is going to be.
[00:47:43.822 --> 00:47:45.702]  So you can't even really preach right now?
[00:47:46.242 --> 00:47:47.303]  No, quite the contrary.
[00:47:47.643 --> 00:47:50.303]  I'm preaching Sunday and I'm going to preach the way I've always been preaching.
[00:47:50.883 --> 00:47:54.804]  No, we are maintaining the position that we are not in the wrong.
[00:47:54.944 --> 00:47:57.625]  So we are continuing with business as usual.
[00:48:00.239 --> 00:48:05.662]  We are waiting to hear back from them about whether or not they're going to revoke our tax-exempt status.
[00:48:05.822 --> 00:48:07.583]  What about the faith-based initiative?
[00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:14.326]  Bush wants to dole out $9-10 billion a year, and then the churches will have to hire who the government says.
[00:48:14.346 --> 00:48:22.811]  And I know a lot of churches want that money, so they've jumped on the bandwagon, but the faith-based initiative is a total violation of church and state.
[00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:23.951]  I think so, too.
[00:48:24.312 --> 00:48:28.794]  I think it really does cross the line of church and state and the establishment of religion.
[00:48:29.054 --> 00:48:32.196]  Cross the line, it jumps the median and runs into the other lane in traffic.
[00:48:32.356 --> 00:48:33.696]  Yeah, that's why we've been against it.
[00:48:33.716 --> 00:48:35.837]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:48:35.857 --> 00:48:39.259]  I mean, we've gotten to the point in America where they're telling people not to preach against war?
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.602]  That's the incredible part of this.
[00:48:47.403 --> 00:48:52.465]  That the federal government would come in and tell a church that they can't preach against war.
[00:48:53.368 --> 00:48:54.969]  Which the church follows.
[00:48:55.469 --> 00:48:56.389]  The Prince of Peace.
[00:48:56.709 --> 00:48:58.450]  The one who said, blessed are the peacemakers.
[00:48:59.451 --> 00:49:01.171]  It is absolutely incredible.
[00:49:01.251 --> 00:49:04.553]  It's still very difficult for me to believe that they're taking this position.
[00:49:04.793 --> 00:49:08.575]  But reading the LA Times here, it seems like the IRS doesn't care and they're just going forward.
[00:49:09.295 --> 00:49:10.475]  That's precisely correct.
[00:49:10.555 --> 00:49:11.436]  They are going forward.
[00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:15.017]  And, you know, I've seen this in the past.
[00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:18.799]  They revoke the 501c3, then they claim back taxes and they'll come yank your church.
[00:49:19.608 --> 00:49:20.329]  They'll come steal it.
[00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:24.391]  We have no idea exactly what the penalties would be if they prevail on this.
[00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:26.132]  Well, we know what they've done in the past.
[00:49:26.553 --> 00:49:26.753]  Yes.
[00:49:28.014 --> 00:49:37.460]  So, and more images of SWAT teams taking over churches just in case somebody doesn't like it, and selling it off so we can build a Walmart on it.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.721]  This is unbelievable.
[00:49:39.001 --> 00:49:39.121]  Yep.
[00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:43.952]  Well, we're talking to Rector J. Edwin Bacon.
[00:49:43.972 --> 00:49:46.375]  Why don't you give us the website for the church?
[00:49:46.475 --> 00:49:46.756]  Sure.
[00:49:47.096 --> 00:49:51.641]  It's allsaints, one word, hyphen, P-A-S dot org.
[00:49:52.462 --> 00:49:53.323]  Say that again, please, sir?
[00:49:53.524 --> 00:49:53.744]  Yes.
[00:49:54.905 --> 00:49:58.810]  Allsaints, one word, hyphen, P-A-S dot org.
[00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:01.511]  All right.
[00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:08.879]  Allsaints-PAS.org.
[00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:11.001]  We'll post that up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.202]  You've got about 30 seconds left.
[00:50:12.243 --> 00:50:12.763]  Anything else, sir?
[00:50:13.284 --> 00:50:15.086]  Thank you very much for your support.
[00:50:15.466 --> 00:50:19.731]  We have a lot of information on our website about the IRS examination.
[00:50:20.391 --> 00:50:28.355]  Including sermons, my statement, and we would love to hear any words of support from your listeners.
[00:50:28.576 --> 00:50:28.896]  All right.
[00:50:28.936 --> 00:50:30.056]  Thank you so much, Rector.
[00:50:30.257 --> 00:50:30.717]  Take care.
[00:50:31.297 --> 00:50:31.757]  All right.
[00:50:31.817 --> 00:50:33.938]  So there's the fellow that runs the church over there for the preacher.
[00:50:33.979 --> 00:50:36.640]  Can't even give a sermon without the thought police coming in.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:44.004]  And I've got stacks of articles here from all over the world where they're arresting preachers and grabbing people, and they do it right here in America now.
[00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:46.872]  With the hate crimes garbage.
[00:50:47.673 --> 00:50:49.033]  Bush's Justice Department.
[00:50:49.394 --> 00:50:50.914]  Those were conservative preachers, by the way.
[00:50:51.575 --> 00:50:53.016]  Facing 47 years in prison.
[00:50:53.036 --> 00:50:56.358]  Boy, I am very upset about this.
[00:50:56.398 --> 00:50:56.958]  What about you?
[00:50:56.978 --> 00:50:57.918]  We'll come right back.
[00:50:57.958 --> 00:50:58.519]  Tons of news.
[00:50:58.559 --> 00:50:59.940]  Another great guest coming up.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.380]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.603 --> 00:51:05.444]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.704 --> 00:51:07.285]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:12.288]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.648 --> 00:51:17.050]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:21.652]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.892 --> 00:51:24.733]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.833 --> 00:51:29.494]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.694 --> 00:51:34.115]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.335 --> 00:51:41.536]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.796 --> 00:51:44.237]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:54.161 --> 00:52:54.822]  Thanks for having me.
[00:53:18.343 --> 00:53:19.004]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.541 --> 00:53:39.081]  We're good to go.
[00:53:39.101 --> 00:53:39.842]  We're good to go.
[00:54:23.574 --> 00:54:28.578]  That's right, folks.
[00:54:28.618 --> 00:54:31.820]  No more Mr. Nice Guy when it comes to defending our liberty.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.642]  Across the board, I'm turning the heat up.
[00:54:34.843 --> 00:54:41.007]  Coming up, Wayne Madison with the NSA to blow the whistle on a whole bunch of key information and give us great analysis.
[00:54:41.047 --> 00:54:42.308]  I really look forward to this interview.
[00:54:43.186 --> 00:54:45.207]  And we will have open phones later in the next hour.
[00:54:45.247 --> 00:54:58.071]  We'll also, in the third hour, get into what's happening with the energy crisis and the hearings today and what's happening in France and some really scary police state news concerning Christians being arrested all over the world, including here in the United States of America.
[00:54:59.218 --> 00:54:59.858]  So that's coming up.
[00:54:59.899 --> 00:55:02.620]  For the next four minutes, though, I am honored to have had her in a few weeks.
[00:55:03.141 --> 00:55:04.201]  It's good to have her back with us.
[00:55:04.221 --> 00:55:05.903]  She's got a little bit of a cold she just got over.
[00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:10.826]  And that is Debbie Morrow, the Made in America highest quality.
[00:55:10.866 --> 00:55:13.067]  It's what I used before they were sponsors, I used them.
[00:55:13.588 --> 00:55:16.910]  Made in America, big Berkey, also the British Berkey if you want it.
[00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:21.653]  And she'll join us here for a few minutes, then we'll start the third hour and get into all this other news and information.
[00:55:21.993 --> 00:55:23.294]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[00:55:23.534 --> 00:55:24.235]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:55:24.335 --> 00:55:25.476]  Thank you for having me.
[00:55:26.136 --> 00:55:26.697]  You bet.
[00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:37.704]  We've got a lot of different specials right now, and for people that have got knock-off filter systems, you guys have got the filters to go in there, knock-off containers, to make them high quality.
[00:55:37.744 --> 00:55:42.427]  You've got small sports bottle filters that are very inexpensive, that make the water safe to drink.
[00:55:42.447 --> 00:55:46.669]  You've got purification that makes it totally clean to below detectable levels.
[00:55:46.689 --> 00:55:47.490]  That means there's nothing in it.
[00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:48.650]  Yes, it's true.
[00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:49.851]  I do agree with it.
[00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:51.071]  And we have some holiday specials.
[00:56:18.283 --> 00:56:22.106]  Or group discount specials that we're making available.
[00:56:22.146 --> 00:56:23.467]  Does that dog come with it?
[00:56:23.807 --> 00:56:27.190]  Yes, that's my protector when the UPS guy comes.
[00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:28.351]  What kind of doggy is it?
[00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:29.793]  He's a mutt.
[00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:34.036]  When you pull up the internet and look up the word mutt, it's like they took a picture of him.
[00:56:34.056 --> 00:56:36.719]  Do you know what we have in my office?
[00:56:37.689 --> 00:56:38.009]  What?
[00:56:38.209 --> 00:56:41.311]  At our office, our new office, we haven't opened yet to the public, this bookstore.
[00:56:41.752 --> 00:56:48.196]  We have a basset hound whose name is the Baron Don Sanchez or something like that.
[00:56:48.236 --> 00:56:49.256]  That was his name on the papers.
[00:56:49.777 --> 00:56:52.378]  One of my employees, it's his dog, but I'm kind of expropriating him.
[00:56:52.678 --> 00:56:54.199]  We have a basset hound here at the office.
[00:56:54.239 --> 00:56:55.320]  People will be able to come by and see.
[00:56:56.019 --> 00:56:56.900]  Oh, that's so nice.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.644]  I feel real, because, you know, I'm here alone a lot, so I feel real good having my dogs here.
[00:57:01.664 --> 00:57:02.424]  That's right.
[00:57:02.524 --> 00:57:06.167]  Debbie, you guys are the national maker and distributor of these, and you answer the phones.
[00:57:06.448 --> 00:57:07.609]  People get the lowest price.
[00:57:07.649 --> 00:57:11.412]  A Chinese knockoff or an Indian knockoff is about $50 more.
[00:57:11.472 --> 00:57:12.452]  Tell us about the specials.
[00:57:12.853 --> 00:57:25.143]  Well, the special that we're having is, because a lot of people want to buy for the holiday gift, we'll do four of the Berkey lights without the light and give seven...
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:26.621]  Wait a minute.
[00:57:26.641 --> 00:57:29.202]  I haven't heard of this new special.
[00:57:29.242 --> 00:57:31.383]  You buy what and you get the seven of them?
[00:57:52.754 --> 00:57:55.676]  And you get seven Berkey sport bottles for free.
[00:57:55.876 --> 00:57:59.218]  And again, these big, they have Lexian stainless steel models.
[00:57:59.318 --> 00:57:59.559]  Right.
[00:57:59.739 --> 00:58:02.681]  But when you get those... This is the Berkey lights without the lights.
[00:58:03.241 --> 00:58:11.086]  And when you get four of those units to give as gifts, then you get seven of the $35 high-quality sports bottles that do 600 plus refills.
[00:58:11.246 --> 00:58:11.547]  Right.
[00:58:12.047 --> 00:58:16.790]  And if you get four of the stainless steel Royal Berkeys that are $260 each...
[00:58:18.636 --> 00:58:20.858]  You get 10 sport burpees for free.
[00:58:21.178 --> 00:58:21.599]  Amazing.
[00:58:21.679 --> 00:58:22.540]  Folks, give them a call.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.220]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:29.126]  And you've still got all the other great specials, right, Debbie?
[00:58:29.486 --> 00:58:31.608]  People can still get big discounts on a bunch of other stuff.
[00:58:31.968 --> 00:58:32.829]  Give her a call, folks.
[00:58:32.849 --> 00:58:37.914]  1-888-803-4438 or burkeywater.com.
[00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.116]  All right, the second hour is coming up at you.

[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.320]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.981 --> 00:59:00.041]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.762 --> 00:59:01.902]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.502 --> 00:59:03.343]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:04.924]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.644 --> 00:59:09.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:13.908]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.431 --> 00:59:32.626]  Already into hour number two, Wayne Madison blowing the whistle on 9-11, what's going on with the French riots, the indictments, what comes next of Lord Libby.
[00:59:33.267 --> 00:59:35.189]  It's all coming up in about eight minutes.
[00:59:36.149 --> 00:59:36.509]  We're good to go.
[00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.970]  We're good to go.
[00:59:54.048 --> 00:59:59.350]  They've got a bunch of different specials where you get a Berkey light system $1.99 and get a free gift, one of the sports bottles.
[00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.431]  Potassium iodate to protect you during a radiological event.
[01:00:02.731 --> 01:00:04.411]  Sheltering in place DVDs.
[01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:09.113]  How to make your house be safe from chemical and biological and radiological in case that happens.
[01:00:09.433 --> 01:00:10.733]  A lot of key stuff you need.
[01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.774]  Give Debbie a call if you miss the number.
[01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:13.754]  Here it is.
[01:00:13.774 --> 01:00:15.495]  1-888-803-4438 888-803-4438 Or go online to BerkeyWater.com
[01:00:24.432 --> 01:00:25.553]  We're good to go.
[01:00:39.629 --> 01:00:45.030]  And we fax it immediately over to their office, and then they send it out to you that day.
[01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:50.852]  So, BerkeyWater.com, Infowars.com, or 888-803-4438.
[01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:52.052]  Again, the good news.
[01:00:52.072 --> 01:00:58.193]  The hate crimes law looks like it's dead this year, and now we're forcing Republican leaders to even come out against it and say they're not for it.
[01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:01.894]  That is new in the last seven years of them trying to ram it through.
[01:01:02.134 --> 01:01:04.175]  Some of the French rioting is beginning to ease.
[01:01:04.195 --> 01:01:05.755]  Instead of a thousand cars and...
[01:01:06.495 --> 01:01:07.176]  50 buildings a night.
[01:01:07.216 --> 01:01:11.218]  It's down to a couple hundred cars and two or three major super centers a night.
[01:01:11.998 --> 01:01:17.701]  We're no longer burning white women with gasoline and raping and killing, so it's certainly good news there.
[01:01:17.881 --> 01:01:25.966]  Oh, I know I'm evil for saying raping and killing and burning white people is bad, but I'm also against the Klan, so I'm hated by them too, so it's okay.
[01:01:27.026 --> 01:01:28.167]  Federal hate bill again.
[01:01:28.227 --> 01:01:29.207]  Now virtually dead.
[01:01:29.247 --> 01:01:30.848]  That's the analysis from Pastor Ted Pike.
[01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:31.849]  Pentagon having to...
[01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:33.495]  We're good to go.
[01:01:53.466 --> 01:02:06.893]  And we beat Prop 9 that would let the unelected, unaccountable boards here in the state basically hand over our roads to Juan Carlos and the Spanish company over there that was going to tax all our roads.
[01:02:06.913 --> 01:02:09.874]  But unfortunately, one of the initiatives did pass.
[01:02:11.235 --> 01:02:13.356]  And so Prop 9 went down.
[01:02:13.416 --> 01:02:17.398]  Prop 1 did pass, giving all this new funding to the Texas Railroad Commission and others.
[01:02:17.418 --> 01:02:21.580]  But we've got guests coming up the last 30 minutes of the show to give us the proper analysis.
[01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:25.000]  A more detailed, in-depth analysis of that.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.121]  So that's some good news.
[01:02:26.361 --> 01:02:41.769]  Some bad news is that anybody given a speeding ticket, anybody given any misdemeanor, will have their DNA taken and put in a database by the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, neocon governor, George Pataki, that Republicans love so much.
[01:02:42.389 --> 01:02:43.170]  So we're facing that.
[01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:47.457]  Really bad news here out of the San Francisco Chronicle and Newsmax.
[01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.739]  San Francisco approves handgun ban.
[01:02:49.819 --> 01:03:00.269]  Voters approve ballot measures to ban handguns in San Francisco, except for the criminals and the police, which are interchangeable, and urges the city's public high schools and college campuses to keep out military recruiters.
[01:03:02.694 --> 01:03:03.795]  Only they should keep them out.
[01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:07.978]  It's a free country, but they shouldn't let them openly force recruiting and force the kids to listen.
[01:03:08.398 --> 01:03:09.199]  That's what shouldn't happen.
[01:03:09.559 --> 01:03:17.164]  The gun ban prohibits the manufacturers and sale of old firearms and ammunition in the city and makes it illegal for residents to keep handguns in their homes or businesses.
[01:03:17.204 --> 01:03:19.186]  And I predict within a year they'll ban rifles as well.
[01:03:20.627 --> 01:03:22.148]  So, message to all criminals.
[01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:23.048]  Move to San Francisco.
[01:03:23.108 --> 01:03:24.089]  It's the happy hunting ground.
[01:03:26.225 --> 01:03:32.768]  Precincts reporting early Wednesday, 58% of voters backed the proposed gun ban, while 42% opposed it.
[01:03:32.828 --> 01:03:36.570]  Well, let all the nuts and crazies go there.
[01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.451]  Let them be their hellhole wonderland.
[01:03:39.651 --> 01:03:41.492]  It's sick.
[01:03:41.572 --> 01:03:43.133]  There's other incredibly bad news.
[01:03:43.193 --> 01:03:45.874]  Chinese get prison time for Bible delivery.
[01:03:46.234 --> 01:03:47.715]  It's like delivering cocaine or something.
[01:03:48.055 --> 01:03:50.616]  We'll be right back with our guest, Wayne Madison.
[01:03:54.096 --> 01:04:01.484]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.765 --> 01:04:06.510]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:12.377]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.657 --> 01:04:13.578]  And much, much more.
[01:04:13.598 --> 01:04:16.139]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:04:16.239 --> 01:04:22.163]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:04:22.183 --> 01:04:22.643]  Order online now.
[01:04:40.114 --> 01:04:40.414]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:54.625]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.005 --> 01:05:00.727]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:00.987 --> 01:05:06.129]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:15.733]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.093 --> 01:05:21.055]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:25.377]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:25.577 --> 01:05:30.319]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:36.521]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:36.961 --> 01:05:43.184]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:53.473 --> 01:05:54.093]  We're good to go.
[01:05:54.113 --> 01:05:54.254]  I think?
[01:06:13.865 --> 01:06:15.407]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:06:15.567 --> 01:06:19.031]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:06:19.311 --> 01:06:23.096]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:06:23.356 --> 01:06:28.342]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:06:28.602 --> 01:06:30.304]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:06:30.544 --> 01:06:34.549]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:36.651]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:11.589]  You know, I just want to thank God for this wonderful creation He made and just how beautiful this earth is and all the good things that are in it.
[01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.931]  We can never lose sight of why we fight evil.
[01:07:14.971 --> 01:07:17.453]  It's to protect all the good things that are out there.
[01:07:17.473 --> 01:07:18.154]  All the beauty.
[01:07:18.714 --> 01:07:19.535]  All the innocence.
[01:07:20.555 --> 01:07:22.517]  And every day I'm just so thankful that
[01:07:23.978 --> 01:07:42.153]  That I love my daily work, that I love exposing corruption, that I love standing up to bullies and scum, and that we've had so much success doing, and that I am humbled and thankful and honored to be your talk show host and to have you tuning in Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 and then back from 9 to midnight, all time central standard.

[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.141]  Wayne Madison!
[01:07:53.743 --> 01:07:58.587]  He is the editor of the WayneMadisonReport.com.
[01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.969]  I keep calling him Madison.
[01:08:00.989 --> 01:08:01.750]  He's Madson.
[01:08:02.371 --> 01:08:07.795]  Wayne Madson is an investigative journalist, nationally distributed columnist, and author who has covered Washington, D.C.
[01:08:07.815 --> 01:08:10.978]  politics, national security, and intelligence issues since 1994.
[01:08:12.907 --> 01:08:18.451]  He has written for the Village Voice, the Progressive, CAQ, Counterpunch, and the Intelligence Newsletter based in Paris.

[01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:39.162]  A personal data protection.
[01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:41.143]  I ought to have him on just about that sometime.
[01:08:41.644 --> 01:08:46.347]  Macmillan, 1992, an acclaimed reference book on international data protection law.
[01:08:46.407 --> 01:08:47.488]  Madsen is a former U.S.
[01:08:47.548 --> 01:08:53.071]  Naval officer who was assigned to the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration.
[01:08:53.111 --> 01:08:57.394]  He also has some 20 years experience in computer security and data protection.
[01:08:57.961 --> 01:08:58.541]  Privacy.
[01:08:58.862 --> 01:09:06.367]  He has also worked for the Naval Data Automation Command Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Sciences Corporation.
[01:09:06.487 --> 01:09:08.188]  Oh, Computer Sciences Corporation.
[01:09:08.768 --> 01:09:11.550]  I want to say hi to them listening today.
[01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.511]  That's a name that's come up before.
[01:09:14.752 --> 01:09:17.394]  But let me just say this about Wayne Madsen.
[01:09:18.294 --> 01:09:20.576]  He joins the legions, and he's been...
[01:09:21.522 --> 01:09:21.962]  We're good to go.
[01:09:21.982 --> 01:09:22.163]  I think?
[01:09:39.534 --> 01:09:41.835]  Wayne has just done a lot of great analysis.
[01:09:41.915 --> 01:09:49.600]  I mean, there's so many kooks and frauds out there and people, charlatans, but nobody seems to check what they said a year ago or five years ago or six months ago.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.521]  You know, that's really the test.
[01:09:52.181 --> 01:09:55.903]  That's really the test of information is long-term.
[01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:58.685]  Track records, you know, that's who you can trust.
[01:09:58.985 --> 01:10:00.226]  People who've been accurate in the past.
[01:10:00.266 --> 01:10:01.407]  He's been extremely accurate.
[01:10:01.727 --> 01:10:05.469]  Unfortunately, I wish he was wrong about a lot of things, but no, he's right about them.
[01:10:06.129 --> 01:10:15.452]  And he's got a good head on his shoulders, and he joins the list of other people going public, like Ray McGovern, I mean, top analysts in Ronald Reagan and in Bush 41's administrations.
[01:10:16.232 --> 01:10:20.093]  Ron Paul saying the government wants to open martial law and confiscate our guns and put us in camps.
[01:10:20.153 --> 01:10:24.114]  I mean, we've gotten to this point now, folks.
[01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:29.896]  German defense ministers and technology ministers, Michael Meacher, George Galloway, Cynthia McKinney,
[01:10:30.914 --> 01:10:33.279]  If I try to list all the whistleblowers, there's so many.
[01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:35.262]  FBI agent Robert Wright, Sybil Evans.
[01:10:35.543 --> 01:10:36.865]  The list just goes on and on.
[01:10:36.885 --> 01:10:39.811]  People say, well, if all this stuff was true, people would be blowing the whistle.
[01:10:39.851 --> 01:10:40.472]  We'd hear about it.
[01:10:41.619 --> 01:10:42.539]  We have heard about it.
[01:10:42.599 --> 01:10:45.320]  So here today, joining us is Wayne Madsen.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:48.602]  I want to talk about 9-11 out of the gates, his analysis of it.
[01:10:48.842 --> 01:10:50.122]  I want to get into the French riots.
[01:10:50.142 --> 01:10:55.884]  He wrote an article that we posted on prisonplanet.com that got into how it was engineered.
[01:10:55.904 --> 01:11:07.909]  And regardless of if it was engineered physically like a Mosaddegh situation in 1953, or whether it was engineered by the basic engineering of society itself, it is engineered.
[01:11:08.049 --> 01:11:09.670]  And it is part of a larger plan.
[01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:10.630]  You can guarantee that.
[01:11:11.491 --> 01:11:13.532]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:11:35.132 --> 01:11:35.472]  You bet.
[01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:48.597]  Just tell us a little bit more about yourself, and then you've gotten a lot more vocal in the last few years, or at least gotten a lot more attention, and give us your analysis of what we're facing with this current crop running the empire right now, and then let's go down the primrose path.
[01:11:48.897 --> 01:11:50.418]  Oh my God, where do I start?
[01:11:50.578 --> 01:11:59.381]  I mean, here in Washington, we've got this corporate control media, of course, that has been asleep at the wheel on all these issues.
[01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:02.402]  As a matter of fact, today in Washington, we have Ahmed Chalabi
[01:12:03.004 --> 01:12:07.706]  Visiting the American Enterprise Institute as an honored guest.
[01:12:08.626 --> 01:12:12.727]  He's going to be meeting with Rumsfeld and Rice and Hadley.
[01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:17.389]  I thought he's a wanted man with our little ally who we have an extradition treaty with.
[01:12:17.509 --> 01:12:20.750]  Jordan and our government said six months ago they wanted to arrest him.
[01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:26.412]  Not only that, the FBI's got him under investigation for passing classified information on U.S.
[01:12:26.452 --> 01:12:28.193]  cryptography to the Iranians.
[01:12:28.793 --> 01:12:31.274]  He was over there talking to the Iranian president
[01:12:31.698 --> 01:12:36.460]  Right before he comes here, I mean, the guy, you know, it's just amazing.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.882]  And I think, you know, the media, of course, has been asleep.
[01:12:40.202 --> 01:12:58.572]  They haven't figured it out that Chalabi was the guy who was the source of all the bogus information, who helped launder all this curveball stuff and Al Libby stuff and, you know, this number two and Al Qaeda and that guy and weapons of mass destruction.
[01:12:58.732 --> 01:12:58.992]  This is...
[01:12:59.512 --> 01:13:12.423]  This is sort of like, Chalabi is sort of like the guy, if you went to a Baghdad bazaar, he'd be the guy trying to sell you a flying carpet, saying, well, my carpet flies longer than most of these other guys here in the bazaar.
[01:13:12.543 --> 01:13:22.752]  So, I mean, I guess he belongs here with the other charlatans in Washington, but he's here today, and he's an honored guest of the administration.
[01:13:24.898 --> 01:13:37.567]  But last time I heard they were going to arrest him, and boy, they were going to do something about this guy who passed secrets to the Iranians, and this guy who's been involved in stealing $300 million, and a guy involved in torture, and all this.
[01:13:37.627 --> 01:13:37.907]  Why?
[01:13:38.228 --> 01:13:41.030]  But now he's talking to the prestigious Neocon group.
[01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:41.990]  Well, that's right.
[01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:49.736]  And, you know, of course, the talk in the Congress today isn't about the horror of having Chalabi back in Washington as this...
[01:13:50.507 --> 01:13:53.351]  As this honored guest.
[01:13:53.891 --> 01:14:04.204]  But the talk is, let's have an investigation of who leaked the information about the secret CIA prison camps around the world that the Washington Post wrote about.
[01:14:04.785 --> 01:14:09.670]  It looks like they may want to make... The neocons want their own...
[01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:16.491]  That's right!
[01:14:16.531 --> 01:14:22.155]  Let's punish whoever exposed these former Soviet-era gulags, now run by our boys.
[01:14:22.215 --> 01:14:23.375]  Why, this is a major!
[01:14:23.796 --> 01:14:24.876]  Who is this traitor?
[01:14:25.457 --> 01:14:30.820]  But let's bring in the guy that gave our cryptography secrets, the crown jewels, to the Iranians.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:31.941]  Oh, we love you!
[01:14:33.155 --> 01:14:39.179]  Well, it's just the topsy-turvy world here that we've experienced since Bush became president.
[01:14:39.319 --> 01:14:40.219]  What are they trying to do?
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.941]  Why do they think they can get away with all this?
[01:14:41.961 --> 01:14:48.565]  Because you've got the one crowd of globalists who want to be incremental, but the Bush crowd is like Mad Dog Cujo.
[01:14:49.265 --> 01:14:50.146]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:50.446 --> 01:15:00.572]  If I were sitting back during the Reagan administration looking at a bunch of people in the government doing to the government as they're doing in our foreign policy, in our military policy,
[01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:01.374]  We're good to go.
[01:15:23.631 --> 01:15:25.533]  The terrorists, as Bush calls them.
[01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:34.081]  What they've done is we are weaker now than we've ever been in the past, even during the height of the Second World War.
[01:15:34.501 --> 01:15:38.625]  You've got to figure whose side are these people really on?
[01:15:38.645 --> 01:15:42.909]  These neocons, what's their agenda?
[01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:44.931]  And it certainly isn't an American agenda.
[01:15:46.352 --> 01:15:46.993]  I hear you.
[01:15:47.453 --> 01:15:53.719]  Let's go ahead and jump into the article you wrote that's up at your fine website, waynemadsonreport.com.
[01:15:53.739 --> 01:15:55.761]  We also have a link to it on prisonplanet.com.
[01:15:56.802 --> 01:16:09.092]  The intel you got on these riots, at least the precursor of the flashpoint, the fire being literally started by intelligence agencies, break that down for us.
[01:16:09.712 --> 01:16:19.260]  One of the things you have to watch for is that it's an intelligence operation to create what are known as false flags, false flag operations.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.921]  I still have a lot of questions about that.
[01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:25.649]  Certain individuals before and on 9-11 and what they were up to.
[01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:28.570]  It certainly looks like they were engaged in false flags.
[01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:42.133]  But what we've seen in France, it appears to me, this was not spontaneous from a bunch of... Number one, the neocon press is blaming this on... They're calling it the French Intifada, the Ramadan Revolution.
[01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:46.835]  They're saying, look at all these... This is because all these Muslims have been treated so nice by the Europeans.
[01:16:46.855 --> 01:16:48.195]  It has nothing to do with it.
[01:16:48.255 --> 01:16:48.555]  Although...
[01:16:50.096 --> 01:16:54.037]  The riots started in an immigrant community north of Paris.
[01:16:55.958 --> 01:17:14.462]  The people who have engaged in the violence have largely been, well, there's been Muslims from North Africa, there's been non-Muslims from West Africa, Central Africa, Afro-Caribbeans who live in France, and also very poor, unemployed people
[01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:15.602]  White French.
[01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:17.643]  So this is a best support.
[01:17:17.843 --> 01:17:25.927]  Yeah, this Madison Avenue system makes people feel so worthless that they just, you know, any chance to go absolutely nuts, and that's what we've seen happen here.
[01:17:25.967 --> 01:17:34.670]  But we saw this with Mosaddegh, and we saw this a few years ago when I ran again, where the globalists, though, start the ball rolling, and you found some evidence in there.
[01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:35.810]  Well, that's right.
[01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:38.252]  I mean, you look at the targets.
[01:17:38.312 --> 01:17:41.713]  The targets were largely government, French government targets.
[01:17:41.773 --> 01:17:50.757]  Of course, France, the arson is only hitting those countries in NATO who stood up against the United States and refused to go into Iraq.
[01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:51.838]  France was the first.
[01:17:51.898 --> 01:17:55.739]  Now it's spread into Belgium, and there's been some incidents in Germany.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:03.603]  I think that what we see, though, that this is only benefiting the neoconservatives in these various countries, like Nicolas Sarkozy,
[01:18:04.008 --> 01:18:11.512]  Who's the French Interior Minister who really stoked the flames by calling these French youths scum and said they should be Karcherized.
[01:18:11.572 --> 01:18:19.937]  Karcher is sort of like a heavy-duty washing system, spray system that they sell in France.
[01:18:20.297 --> 01:18:26.881]  So basically, he's talking about turning the hoses as we remember what happened in the South in the 60s on these youths.
[01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:29.122]  So he really inflamed the situation.
[01:18:31.443 --> 01:18:40.665]  We'll come back and talk about how it helps the neocons and how the youth that are out there rioting are only going to bring a police state down on themselves.
[01:18:40.725 --> 01:18:44.625]  And then I want to get into just where Wayne Madsen thinks everything is going.
[01:18:45.165 --> 01:18:47.466]  What he sees happening in the next month, the next year.
[01:18:48.746 --> 01:18:50.386]  Who controls the neocons?
[01:18:50.446 --> 01:18:51.326]  It's all coming up.
[01:18:51.366 --> 01:18:55.847]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.867 --> 01:18:58.068]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.108 --> 01:18:59.868]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:08.917]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.137 --> 01:19:11.779]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:11.759 --> 01:19:13.180]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:20.266]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:20.526 --> 01:19:23.509]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:23.869 --> 01:19:24.349]  We're good to go.
[01:19:24.409 --> 01:19:24.689]  I think?
[01:19:53.482 --> 01:20:02.104]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:20:02.324 --> 01:20:13.567]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:20:13.587 --> 01:20:16.468]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:16.808 --> 01:20:20.909]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:21.570]  We're good to go.
[01:20:37.748 --> 01:20:41.670]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:42.410]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:43.931]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:45.952]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:46.112 --> 01:20:46.573]  One and the same.
[01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:48.694]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:21:07.702 --> 01:21:13.184]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:13.604 --> 01:21:16.744]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:16.985 --> 01:21:18.825]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:18.865 --> 01:21:22.506]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:23.786 --> 01:21:24.667]  Here is reality.
[01:21:25.027 --> 01:21:28.608]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:29.108 --> 01:21:32.769]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:33.309 --> 01:21:36.150]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:21:37.498 --> 01:21:37.699]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:57.926]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[01:21:58.266 --> 01:22:03.548]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:05.669]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:17.153]  The folks at Vitamir blend zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[01:22:17.353 --> 01:22:18.353]  Good health starts in your mouth.

[01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:31.285]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.
[01:22:31.545 --> 01:22:33.847]  Call 877-817-9829 at 677-817-9829 and order Vitamir mouthwash and toothpaste today.
[01:22:34.047 --> 01:22:36.329]  He'll be glad you did, and so will that special someone in your life.

[01:22:49.796 --> 01:22:59.418]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.098 --> 01:23:02.458]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.999 --> 01:23:05.659]  So much corruption.
[01:23:06.299 --> 01:23:09.640]  So much open tyranny and despotism.
[01:23:10.544 --> 01:23:12.910]  Talking to Wayne Madsen, former U.S.
[01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:16.558]  Naval officer who was assigned to the National Security Agency, worked in the Reagan administration.
[01:23:17.139 --> 01:23:18.883]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:23:20.935 --> 01:23:22.236]  Wayne, I've got a few notes here.
[01:23:22.256 --> 01:23:23.437]  I want to talk more about the riots.
[01:23:23.517 --> 01:23:24.657]  I want to get into Valerie Plain.
[01:23:24.677 --> 01:23:26.518]  I want to talk about a lot of different issues.
[01:23:26.878 --> 01:23:33.982]  But I also, I know you've written an article today about Trinidad and this Israeli spy who they believe was involved in some bombings.
[01:23:34.562 --> 01:23:39.345]  I mean, when is Israel not involved in bombings to blame it on their enemies to then bring in a police state?
[01:23:39.365 --> 01:23:40.946]  I mean, that's mainstream Israeli news.
[01:23:40.986 --> 01:23:44.008]  But in America, it seems to be like the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:23:44.028 --> 01:23:45.588]  People don't know that it's public.
[01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:48.971]  The oil companies, they're being grilled.
[01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:51.052]  They've made 96 billion plus in profits.
[01:23:51.432 --> 01:23:58.755]  That's just the top, what, five oil companies, folks, not counting the others, which are all basically subsidiaries of the same people.
[01:23:59.635 --> 01:24:02.937]  And they're up there before Congress, and the Congress is throwing softballs.
[01:24:03.457 --> 01:24:08.179]  We know that the oil companies control the OPEC cartel and tell them what to do.
[01:24:08.439 --> 01:24:09.360]  Their own memos show it.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.121]  It also came out, what we already knew a few months ago,
[01:24:13.072 --> 01:24:20.559]  That in 96 they got together and said, let's start buying up all the mom-and-pop refineries, let's shut down our own, and we'll create an artificial bottleneck.
[01:24:21.039 --> 01:24:26.804]  None of that got brought up in these whitewashed hearings by a bunch of congressmen bought and paid for by the very people testifying.
[01:24:27.225 --> 01:24:28.226]  Your comments on that, Wayne?
[01:24:28.646 --> 01:24:35.893]  Well, that's right, and we see the tension between George Bush and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
[01:24:35.913 --> 01:24:38.235]  A lot of people don't know that Venezuela's oil...
[01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:40.938]  A company is state-owned.
[01:24:41.518 --> 01:24:44.779]  We know it here in the United States as City Service or Citgo.
[01:24:45.139 --> 01:24:46.639]  That's Venezuelan government-owned.
[01:24:48.519 --> 01:24:51.560]  Gasoline in Caracas is 15 cents a gallon.
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:25:01.043]  So for the people, these people up here to say Hugo Chavez, and Bush said this in Brazil the other day, President Chavez, he doesn't do anything for his people.
[01:25:01.223 --> 01:25:02.043]  Well, I'd say 15 cents.
[01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:12.990]  Well, he's also publicly offered us natural gas and fuel at shipping price to, quote, help the American people.
[01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:15.672]  They're mad at him because they say he's over-pumping.
[01:25:16.052 --> 01:25:16.572]  That's right.
[01:25:16.592 --> 01:25:17.032]  That's right.
[01:25:17.072 --> 01:25:19.294]  And he, of course, offered gasoline to the...
[01:25:20.474 --> 01:25:23.375]  You know, the people who survived the hurricane, Katrina.
[01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:31.297]  So he's showing that he's a lot more in tune with people than Bush would ever hope to be.
[01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:39.299]  And that's why I think it's very interesting that Trinidad, which is only seven miles off the coast of Venezuela... They're going to use that as a military launch base.
[01:25:39.319 --> 01:25:39.959]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:40.179 --> 01:25:40.639]  That's right.
[01:25:40.679 --> 01:25:46.121]  And, you know, they're saying that this Israeli guy, Russian-born Israeli...
[01:25:47.122 --> 01:25:50.265]  Who now says, oh, he wants to go back and see his family.
[01:25:50.285 --> 01:25:53.169]  He said, okay, I stole an immigration.
[01:25:53.409 --> 01:26:04.243]  What he did is he stole an immigration visa extension stamp, which is perfect to be stamping that into passports to run agents in and out of Venezuela via Trinidad.
[01:26:05.276 --> 01:26:07.878]  And this is obviously what the Israelis were up to.
[01:26:08.778 --> 01:26:11.940]  Maybe set off bombs in refineries.
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:17.142]  They blame it on the Arabs that we give us a pretext to go into Venezuela and seize the oil.
[01:26:17.523 --> 01:26:28.008]  We've been trying to link, of course, Pat Robertson, as we know, has been trying to link Hugo Chavez to various terrorists saying he's trying to get an atom bomb and saying...
[01:26:28.408 --> 01:26:33.793]  You know, none of this is going to work.
[01:26:33.893 --> 01:26:38.736]  I was down at a little family reunion in East Texas and we were sitting around the deer camp with a
[01:26:40.111 --> 01:26:43.135]  You know, 80-year-old uncles or whatever, and these are real conservatives.
[01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:44.777]  They're like, I like that Chavez.
[01:26:44.937 --> 01:26:46.899]  And by the way, they've worked for all companies.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.522]  Yeah, he's really standing up against these corrupt corporations.
[01:26:49.542 --> 01:26:50.964]  Yeah, he's good.
[01:26:50.984 --> 01:26:51.905]  They lie about him.
[01:26:51.965 --> 01:26:53.707]  That's a bunch of bull that he's a communist.
[01:26:54.028 --> 01:26:58.313]  I mean, when good old boys are seeing right through it, the neocons are in trouble.
[01:26:58.793 --> 01:27:07.675]  Well, I think so, and I think if anybody were to meet Chavez, they would say, hey, this guy is down to earth.
[01:27:07.715 --> 01:27:11.395]  He's a lot more attuned to our needs than Mr. Bush is.
[01:27:11.415 --> 01:27:15.216]  The one thing he's trying to do is provide medical care for his people.
[01:27:15.236 --> 01:27:26.398]  Of course, this is anathema to the neocons and the people that run this government in Washington right now, and obviously the fact that they catch an Israeli who's under suspicion for setting off
[01:27:26.798 --> 01:27:28.499]  Four bombs in Port of Spain.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.702]  One last July in a crowded shopping street.
[01:27:33.902 --> 01:27:35.804]  A severely injured two people.
[01:27:35.904 --> 01:27:37.104]  One lady lost her leg.
[01:27:37.164 --> 01:27:46.330]  So if this is the kind of things that Israelis are bringing into Latin America, I would suggest we should take a closer look at Israeli citizens.
[01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:52.194]  Rather than Muslims and Arabs, as we've talked about, you know, people have talked about in Latin America.
[01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:56.957]  Now, it's not to say they shouldn't be looked at, but Israelis ought to also be looked at very closely.
[01:27:57.217 --> 01:27:58.378]  Well, Wayne, I agree with you.
[01:27:59.038 --> 01:28:03.902]  Look, I get criticized for this, and I'm no enemy of Israel itself, but facts are facts.
[01:28:03.982 --> 01:28:16.210]  Haratz and Jerusalem Post have run reports, so has UPI, of Israelis running fake al-Qaeda groups carrying out many of the bombings against Jews to keep them in political line under their military-industrial complex.
[01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:17.310]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:22.033]  Horatios can say it, the Jerusalem Post can, but we can't talk about it here in the United States.
[01:28:23.114 --> 01:28:24.014]  Well, we're going to.
[01:28:24.074 --> 01:28:25.695]  We've got to stop this New World Order.
[01:28:25.715 --> 01:28:27.776]  This government's using terror.
[01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:30.178]  Let's talk more about that when we get back.
[01:28:30.378 --> 01:28:31.018]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:28:31.578 --> 01:28:33.539]  And I'll also tell you about some of his books, folks.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.581]  Some of them are bestsellers as well.
[01:28:36.781 --> 01:28:37.882]  We're really honored to have him.
[01:28:37.922 --> 01:28:39.563]  It's such a great mind to be able to pick.
[01:28:40.223 --> 01:28:40.643]  Stay with us.
[01:28:40.663 --> 01:28:41.484]  Your call's coming up soon.
[01:28:44.037 --> 01:28:44.938]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.419 --> 01:28:47.020]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.941 --> 01:28:50.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.026 --> 01:28:56.626]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:28:57.167 --> 01:28:58.487]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:58.927 --> 01:29:01.628]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:02.068 --> 01:29:04.728]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:05.148 --> 01:29:11.630]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:29:34.075 --> 01:29:34.435]  Have you?
[01:29:35.015 --> 01:29:36.515]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:40.776]  If only our president would listen to his God.

[01:29:53.712 --> 01:30:01.976]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.216 --> 01:30:06.578]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.878 --> 01:30:15.782]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.982 --> 01:30:19.604]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.904 --> 01:30:24.950]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.231 --> 01:30:31.939]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.087]  What about you?
[01:30:33.727 --> 01:30:39.092]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:54.147 --> 01:30:59.489]  Developed to support respiratory health, Mucolixer is a new and unique product offered by Allergy Research Group.
[01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:06.811]  Mucolixer contains microdose DNA, a novel regulatory or signaling compound which appears to regulate mucus and cilia motion.
[01:31:07.071 --> 01:31:15.494]  Based on preclinical investigations and clinical trials, the small amount of DNA in Mucolixer may support healthy mucus levels via a regulatory mechanism.
[01:31:15.734 --> 01:31:21.436]  Dr. Albert Dahlberg, MD, PhD, states that microdose DNA does not cause any gene transfers.
[01:31:21.596 --> 01:31:24.578]  It is very safe and can be of considerable help to many people.
[01:31:24.919 --> 01:31:28.341]  Numerous doctors and patients have used mucolyxer with great results.
[01:31:28.682 --> 01:31:35.547]  There are dozens of scientific publications from university research on the use of the synthetic form of DNA for immune support in lung health.
[01:31:35.787 --> 01:31:40.691]  However, the DNA in mucolyxer is naturally occurring and is used only in microdose amounts.
[01:31:41.111 --> 01:31:43.954]  This novel approach has stunned both doctors and patients.
[01:31:44.294 --> 01:31:48.998]  Mucolyxer can be found by visiting AllergyResearchGroup.com or by calling 1-800-545-9960.
[01:31:49.018 --> 01:31:57.826]  Wayne Madsen, formerly working at the NSA with the Navy and the Reagan administration.
[01:32:09.028 --> 01:32:12.772]  Is our guest, and coming up in a little while, we'll take some of your calls.
[01:32:12.792 --> 01:32:27.164]  If you have a question for our guest on any of these issues, wide field, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get right to your calls.
[01:32:28.185 --> 01:32:34.391]  Wayne, before we get back into Trinidad and government-sponsored terrorism, which we've caught them right-handed hundreds of times,
[01:32:36.238 --> 01:32:37.098]  Many different governments.
[01:32:37.138 --> 01:32:39.980]  The Soviets, our government, the Israelis, the Germans, the British.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.920]  I mean, they just love it.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.660]  It never stops.
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.241]  World War II, Hitler did it.
[01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:45.582]  Once he got into power to consolidate control.
[01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:50.784]  I know you know that, but for some of the audience that may not be aware of it, most of our audience obviously knows that, probably knows more than I do.
[01:32:51.684 --> 01:32:55.568]  You know, this is kind of the unknown or lost history that people are just now beginning to learn.
[01:32:55.588 --> 01:33:08.240]  But we know that Bush, whereas his cabinet has power and they're doing some things, they're being used by big corporate oil interests and others to carry out a lot of these consolidations and these operations.
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:15.428]  And I guess maybe later they plan to flush him down the historical chute, you know, to use that rhetorical flourish.
[01:33:17.588 --> 01:33:19.649]  How far will the elite let them go?
[01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:21.549]  Or in your opinion, is Bush rogue?
[01:33:21.949 --> 01:33:23.310]  Is he out of control?
[01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:26.551]  What are they trying to set up?
[01:33:26.571 --> 01:33:27.651]  What are they trying to do?
[01:33:27.891 --> 01:33:34.393]  Why don't they know that it was doomed to fail when all of their own big think tanks and computer models said that that would happen?
[01:33:34.433 --> 01:33:36.313]  Wayne, your analysis on that.
[01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:41.795]  Well, I think what happened is when Bush first came into power, I think there were two...
[01:33:42.495 --> 01:33:43.638]  Two blocks.
[01:33:43.779 --> 01:33:47.909]  There was his father's people, the Jim Bakers, the Scowcrofts.
[01:33:49.394 --> 01:33:52.155]  The oil companies, obviously, are part of that equation.
[01:33:52.475 --> 01:33:59.158]  And they saw this as a chance to, like, let's try to get back what we lost when Clinton got elected in 1992.
[01:33:59.298 --> 01:34:15.767]  And then you had the neoconservatives, this bunch that really didn't have much in common with the big money bags that his father used to hang around with, the Richard Pearls and the Wolfowitzes.
[01:34:15.847 --> 01:34:17.868]  And they basically took...
[01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:20.380]  I mean, I think they've been used...
[01:34:45.576 --> 01:34:46.957]  Well, I think in some respects they are because...
[01:35:05.774 --> 01:35:12.861]  Certainly a lot of companies don't like the fact that the entire international infrastructure is breaking down.
[01:35:13.261 --> 01:35:18.847]  They like to use the United Nations and international organizations for their own purposes.
[01:35:19.127 --> 01:35:24.653]  Because when there's some stability, of course, there's a better chance of making a profit
[01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.356]  In that type of environment.
[01:35:26.396 --> 01:35:31.242]  The neocons, on the other hand, they go by a policy called creative destruction.
[01:35:31.782 --> 01:35:37.750]  They like to destroy things, and they think that out of the destruction of what is happening in France right now,
[01:35:38.194 --> 01:35:45.636]  And what's happened in Baghdad and other places around the world, they see some potential huge profits coming out of that.
[01:35:46.437 --> 01:36:01.141]  I think most corporations are risk-averse, whereas the neocons are more than willing to take on Iran, Iraq, and Syria at the same time and throw in North Korea for good measure, maybe Cuba and Venezuela.
[01:36:01.201 --> 01:36:06.543]  These are more maniacal people, and I think if you sat down with the conference board or
[01:36:07.192 --> 01:36:11.313]  The Council of Foreign Relations, you know, they'd say, yeah, these people are crazy.
[01:36:11.353 --> 01:36:15.794]  And as a matter of fact, that's what Colin Powell, that's how he referred to these people.
[01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:17.474]  He said, we call them the crazies.
[01:36:17.534 --> 01:36:21.455]  And we know that from some other people who work for Colin Powell.
[01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:22.395]  That's what they were known as.
[01:36:22.415 --> 01:36:26.316]  But we do see articles out of Foreign Affairs supporting the neocons on a routine basis.
[01:36:26.596 --> 01:36:27.176]  Well, you do.
[01:36:27.256 --> 01:36:32.817]  And then, obviously, you know, out of, you know, Richard Haass, the head of the Council of Foreign Relations is a,
[01:36:33.459 --> 01:36:36.520]  A very big fellow traveler are these people.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:46.963]  But I think even there you see now in the Republican Party, these so-called Republican moderates are now saying, you know, we've got to try to do something.
[01:36:47.003 --> 01:36:49.204]  I'll put it to you this way.
[01:36:49.764 --> 01:36:58.307]  The establishment's letting these boys have a go at it, but they've hedged their bets because they know they'll probably fall down so they can divorce themselves of it and blame them.
[01:36:58.827 --> 01:37:05.213]  Well, that may be true, but I think what's happened is the fact that the neocons are really going to destroy everything if they have their way.
[01:37:05.893 --> 01:37:08.776]  If they get us into a war with Iran... Well, Bush has called it.
[01:37:09.116 --> 01:37:11.698]  Bush has slipped up and said, we're going to create chaos.
[01:37:11.798 --> 01:37:13.840]  I mean, order out of chaos.
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:14.681]  That's right.
[01:37:14.721 --> 01:37:16.002]  That's right.
[01:37:16.062 --> 01:37:18.965]  I think even in a situation like that, you're going to see a lot of...
[01:37:19.665 --> 01:37:25.650]  A lot of mainstream conservatives are going to say, you know, my God, that's not what we bargained on.
[01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:26.851]  That's not what we banked on.
[01:37:26.971 --> 01:37:28.732]  Let's shift gears to another scam.
[01:37:28.832 --> 01:37:35.358]  They're always making profits and setting up martial law prerogatives off of SARS or now bird flu.
[01:37:36.138 --> 01:37:45.346]  Rumsfeld and a bunch of top Bilderberg group members and other administration people set to personally make hundreds of millions of dollars off the billions with Tamiflu alone.
[01:37:45.386 --> 01:37:46.847]  I mean, it's getting really obvious.
[01:37:47.607 --> 01:37:49.808]  Well, yeah, we saw that, of course, with anthrax.
[01:37:49.848 --> 01:37:50.449]  We've been there.
[01:37:50.469 --> 01:37:55.191]  One thing about these guys is that they sing from the same song sheet.
[01:37:55.671 --> 01:38:02.635]  You know, we had the anthrax vaccines, and then there was the smallpox scare.
[01:38:02.935 --> 01:38:08.178]  Well, they made money not just off of BioShillip and Lansing and Admiral Crowe.
[01:38:08.438 --> 01:38:13.900]  They were also making record profits off of the anthrax antibiotic itself.
[01:38:14.081 --> 01:38:16.642]  Yeah, all the Cipro and everything else.
[01:38:17.182 --> 01:38:25.253]  And you've got to wonder, I mean, obviously, I think if we had decent people in the FBI, there's a few left there, not many.
[01:38:25.493 --> 01:38:27.075]  Most of them have left.
[01:38:28.499 --> 01:38:31.501]  These are RICO violators.
[01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:32.802]  These are gangsters.
[01:38:33.663 --> 01:38:36.385]  The people that are in bed with these companies.
[01:38:36.425 --> 01:38:40.088]  Just like Cheney being in bed with Halliburton.
[01:38:40.148 --> 01:38:42.570]  Or his wife being on the board of Lockheed Martin.
[01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.791]  Even worse.
[01:38:43.831 --> 01:38:49.135]  Not only that, Blin Cheney also has a chair, a fellowship chair at the American Enterprise Institute.
[01:38:49.435 --> 01:38:52.180]  Where Mr. Chalabi is today, being wined and dined.
[01:38:52.941 --> 01:38:56.947]  And so, you know, that's, of course, where Richard Pearl and Michael Ledeen hang their hat.
[01:38:57.268 --> 01:39:00.493]  I mean, you know, it would be hard to arrest these people because we know where they work.
[01:39:01.274 --> 01:39:02.956]  We could get them very easy.
[01:39:02.996 --> 01:39:04.038]  We could pick them up at the AEI.
[01:39:04.759 --> 01:39:10.120]  We'd nab about 35 neocons there if we ever wanted to raid the place and pick these guys up.
[01:39:10.581 --> 01:39:12.121]  Exactly, but they rule by fear.
[01:39:12.581 --> 01:39:17.002]  We have that famous quote of the New York Times by Rove saying, I control reality.
[01:39:17.022 --> 01:39:18.222]  It doesn't matter what you think.
[01:39:18.282 --> 01:39:19.823]  We're history's actors.
[01:39:19.843 --> 01:39:21.023]  You're just spectators.
[01:39:21.543 --> 01:39:27.185]  I mean, they do seem insanely arrogant, and that always happens before a big fall.
[01:39:27.245 --> 01:39:28.445]  Where do you see this going?
[01:39:28.465 --> 01:39:32.126]  Are they just going to continue to get away with one travesty after another?
[01:39:32.546 --> 01:39:36.387]  Well, I think the Libby thing is going to open up Pandora's box.
[01:39:36.407 --> 01:39:39.168]  Fitzgerald, obviously, he's a tough prosecutor.
[01:39:39.848 --> 01:39:42.769]  Some people say, well, can he be trusted?
[01:39:43.029 --> 01:39:44.789]  He was, after all, appointed by a Republican.
[01:39:44.829 --> 01:39:50.210]  He said right out at that news conference, he said, look, I'm not a Democrat or a Republican.
[01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:52.991]  I'm independent, and I think...
[01:39:53.870 --> 01:40:02.894]  The way we saw him operate in Illinois, where he started with one indictment and his 66th was the governor, Ryan, shows you how this guy operates.
[01:40:02.934 --> 01:40:05.735]  He's going to try to flip Libby now.
[01:40:06.115 --> 01:40:07.616]  He's going to try to do a deal with him.
[01:40:07.636 --> 01:40:12.138]  Of course, Libby has no negotiating position now because he's under indictment.
[01:40:12.178 --> 01:40:14.899]  Do you think we're going to see some Ron Brown plane crashes?
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:19.382]  I would hope not, certainly not.
[01:40:20.183 --> 01:40:21.724]  We had an election here in Virginia.
[01:40:21.764 --> 01:40:28.109]  We have a Democratic governor now, Tim Kaine, and a Republican lieutenant governor who's friends with Pat Robertson.
[01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:33.334]  My advice to incoming Governor Kaine is to stay off of small airplanes, certainly.
[01:40:34.174 --> 01:40:35.736]  I don't put a lot past these people.
[01:40:35.756 --> 01:40:36.696]  I think they're evil.
[01:40:36.776 --> 01:40:38.598]  I think they're very dangerous.
[01:40:38.698 --> 01:40:42.621]  Yeah, you seem to really have Robertson stuck in your crawl.
[01:40:43.021 --> 01:40:46.144]  And I do, too, because he's a total phony.
[01:40:46.184 --> 01:40:52.229]  But why don't you, Wayne Madsen, NSA analyst, why don't you tell us why you don't like Pat Robertson?
[01:40:52.869 --> 01:41:09.344]  Well, number one, a guy with that much money, everything is tax-free, universities, he's also got his new Attorney General, if he wins this election, there may be a recount, the new Attorney General of Virginia is Robertson-trained, out of Regent University.
[01:41:10.365 --> 01:41:15.309]  Robertson, creating his own foreign policy, he was in bed with African dictators,
[01:41:15.831 --> 01:41:18.172]  I called for the assassination of Hugo Chavez.
[01:41:18.352 --> 01:41:19.392]  Racehorses!
[01:41:19.932 --> 01:41:25.474]  Yes, and gold mines with Charles Taylor in Liberia, diamond mines with Mobutu in Zaire.
[01:41:25.814 --> 01:41:30.815]  This guy is an international fraudster of the nth degree.
[01:41:30.855 --> 01:41:33.116]  He should be sitting in a federal penitentiary now.
[01:41:33.136 --> 01:41:37.357]  And he's being funded by well-meaning, salt-of-the-earth, Christian, gullible people.
[01:41:37.738 --> 01:41:41.779]  Yeah, they need to send their money to people like you and I and stop sending it to Robertson.
[01:41:41.819 --> 01:41:42.559]  He's just telling them,
[01:41:42.859 --> 01:41:45.741]  He's telling them a bunch of lies, and we're trying to tell people the truth.
[01:41:47.282 --> 01:41:48.042]  No, it's true.
[01:41:48.182 --> 01:41:51.544]  There are so many good preachers and pastors and churches out there.
[01:41:52.284 --> 01:41:53.845]  Folks, they are conning you.
[01:41:54.706 --> 01:42:00.429]  So much of this rides on well-meaning people just not being able to believe the fraud they're witnessing.
[01:42:01.244 --> 01:42:01.865]  Well, that's right.
[01:42:01.905 --> 01:42:09.271]  And I mean, it's not just him, but you know, in all of southern Virginia, we've got Robertson in Virginia Beach, we've got Jerry Falwell over in Lynchburg.
[01:42:09.351 --> 01:42:10.492]  So, it's amazing.
[01:42:10.532 --> 01:42:15.777]  We do have a... We elected a Democratic governor yesterday because...
[01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:18.318]  They were turning people out in droves.
[01:42:18.378 --> 01:42:33.024]  And, of course, Rove was starting the nasty business as he's known to do so often, saying that Tim Kaine, the winner, would have never wanted to have executed Adolf Hitler because Tim Kaine's opposed to the death penalty.
[01:42:33.404 --> 01:42:36.045]  But they'll haul out the Hitler card when they need to.
[01:42:36.085 --> 01:42:41.868]  But when someone accuses them of acting like the Nazis and Hitler, of course, that's off the reservation.
[01:42:42.706 --> 01:42:43.787]  So where do you see it going?
[01:42:43.947 --> 01:42:47.170]  Are they ever going to go down, or will it just continue to metastasize?
[01:42:47.391 --> 01:42:50.714]  Well, I see a few things going on.
[01:42:51.014 --> 01:42:53.656]  We know that we've got the investigation by Fitzgerald of...
[01:42:54.671 --> 01:42:56.974]  By the way, let me add something to that.
[01:43:16.838 --> 01:43:19.319]  Who isn't an Israeli spy in this administration?
[01:43:19.339 --> 01:43:29.001]  I mean, these guys openly have dual citizenship, openly are handing all the goodies over, and neocons get on the radio and go, Israel's our friend, let's just give them everything.
[01:43:29.381 --> 01:43:32.501]  And then they've got Shalibi over there who gives stuff to Iran.
[01:43:32.521 --> 01:43:34.362]  I mean, these people are just nuts.
[01:43:34.722 --> 01:43:35.262]  Well, they are.
[01:43:35.282 --> 01:43:45.944]  And also, one thing, Fitzgerald has also been investigating the Hollinger Corporation, and he's already got an indictment against the former publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times
[01:43:46.869 --> 01:43:48.893]  The old boss of Robert Novak.
[01:43:49.996 --> 01:43:54.746]  And so that's eventually going to wind up looking at Richard Perle and Henry Kissinger.
[01:43:55.242 --> 01:43:57.624]  But I go back to BCCI and Clark Clifford and all of them.
[01:43:57.644 --> 01:44:04.471]  These guys have nine lives, and they just get away with it, get away with it, get away with it, get away with it.
[01:44:04.491 --> 01:44:05.171]  That's right.
[01:44:05.852 --> 01:44:08.034]  We've got Elliott Abrams back in the White House.
[01:44:19.524 --> 01:44:21.665]  You know, good old Iran-Contra guy.
[01:44:21.685 --> 01:44:25.828]  We've got... And Poindexter with the Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:44:25.848 --> 01:44:34.893]  And Michael Ledeen meeting Corbani far over in Italy with the Forge Niger documents that led to this whole thing with Valerie Plain's outing.
[01:44:34.974 --> 01:44:37.375]  By the way, Wayne... It's all the same bunch.
[01:44:37.675 --> 01:44:38.917]  They're masters, exactly.
[01:44:38.937 --> 01:44:40.358]  They're masters at distractions.
[01:44:40.779 --> 01:44:43.601]  Everybody thinks they went after Plame to get her husband.
[01:44:43.662 --> 01:44:49.688]  No, they went after her to shut down the investigation into forged documents, and the whole mass media just ignores that.
[01:44:49.948 --> 01:44:55.574]  That's right, and you know, 60 Minutes, of course, was working on a big expose of the forged documents, but the other documents...
[01:44:56.007 --> 01:45:06.755]  The Texas Air National Guard documents knocked 60 minutes off track when Dan Rather had to leave and they had that big phony investigation.
[01:45:06.995 --> 01:45:08.896]  And that was another honeypot from Rove.
[01:45:08.976 --> 01:45:10.658]  That was another Rove operation.
[01:45:10.678 --> 01:45:15.301]  You know, the whole argument was where they forged, you know, those typewriters didn't exist.
[01:45:15.921 --> 01:45:20.224]  Nobody stopped to think that it's against the law to forge government documents.
[01:45:20.304 --> 01:45:22.326]  Rove's smart enough not to go there.
[01:45:22.694 --> 01:45:23.315]  We're good to go.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:45.464]  Hopefully, there will be an indictment of Roe, I do believe.
[01:45:45.584 --> 01:45:49.868]  Well, I want to go back to Trinidad, government-sponsored terror.
[01:45:49.908 --> 01:46:02.399]  I mean, I use this example quite often, but in 1953, our government funded Kermit Roosevelt on the behalf of British Petroleum, BP, to go conduct bombings and mass shootings and hire a couple thousand thugs and put out
[01:46:03.199 --> 01:46:04.060]  We're good to go.
[01:46:22.473 --> 01:46:23.995]  And they said, no, you will give us everything.
[01:46:24.035 --> 01:46:24.715]  You get nothing.
[01:46:25.196 --> 01:46:29.039]  And I heard Roosevelt before he died.
[01:46:29.059 --> 01:46:31.181]  It was an 80s conversation on NPR.
[01:46:31.501 --> 01:46:33.623]  I was already aware of what happened, but they bragged about it.
[01:46:34.702 --> 01:46:37.605]  How our government carried out terror attacks to blame them on Mosaddegh.
[01:46:37.685 --> 01:46:39.767]  I mean, we now know the Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[01:46:39.787 --> 01:46:41.929]  That was well known, but it's now totally declassified.
[01:46:41.949 --> 01:46:43.030]  Totally admitted.
[01:46:43.591 --> 01:46:45.393]  We now know just countless examples.
[01:46:45.413 --> 01:46:46.374]  The USS Liberty.
[01:46:46.794 --> 01:46:53.941]  I've interviewed the admirals who took the phone call from LBJ saying that ship goes to the bottom, where we set it up to have Israel attack it and blame it on Egypt.
[01:46:54.262 --> 01:46:55.803]  I mean, they never stopped, Wayne.
[01:46:55.963 --> 01:46:56.804]  And that's right.
[01:46:56.884 --> 01:46:58.486]  And Northwood, during the...
[01:46:59.046 --> 01:47:01.428]  Well, they're leaving the intelligence agencies in droves.
[01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:04.150]  I can't tell you how many meetings I've had with
[01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:37.489]  People who are whistleblowers, people who are afraid to whistleblow because they still have jobs, but they say, look, it's terrible, we're being told what to do, they're still cooking the intelligence.
[01:47:38.029 --> 01:47:48.231]  The morale in our intelligence, and I might add the military, because I live about three miles from the Pentagon, I have never seen morale as low as it is now.
[01:47:48.311 --> 01:47:49.912]  And for Bush to constantly say,
[01:47:52.272 --> 01:47:54.514]  You know, standing there with backdrops of U.S.
[01:47:54.594 --> 01:47:57.076]  troops and policemen and others.
[01:47:57.736 --> 01:48:00.538]  I mean, this guy is... Did you hear about the AP article?
[01:48:00.558 --> 01:48:02.060]  Dr. Doug Rockey mentioned it yesterday.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:02.960]  I did get a copy of it.
[01:48:03.501 --> 01:48:06.903]  They have taken the lowest standards ever for entrance into the military.
[01:48:07.183 --> 01:48:11.787]  They're taking people that made, what was it, 16 to 30 points out of a possible 100.
[01:48:11.967 --> 01:48:13.788]  I mean, we're talking retarded folks.
[01:48:13.968 --> 01:48:20.113]  Yes, and I said Bush could actually get in the military now without having an influential father.
[01:48:22.354 --> 01:48:25.836]  But yeah, it's terrible.
[01:48:26.596 --> 01:48:28.577]  The CIA is being emaciated.
[01:48:28.637 --> 01:48:33.080]  The National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, good people have left the FBI.
[01:48:35.054 --> 01:48:36.855]  It is a terrible situation.
[01:48:36.876 --> 01:48:38.077]  You said it at the start.
[01:48:38.337 --> 01:48:46.824]  Are we being set up, as Dr. Tani Karasi in Russia said, Bush and them being clients for a larger financial interest to actually bring us down?
[01:48:47.244 --> 01:48:59.595]  Well, as I said, if I were sitting back in the 1980s when I worked in NSA and saw this happening in the government, I would have said, hey, we've been infiltrated by Soviet agents
[01:49:00.335 --> 01:49:02.697]  Our government is being pulled apart from within.
[01:49:03.138 --> 01:49:06.781]  And it's obvious what's happening now.
[01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:10.264]  We're hated around the world.
[01:49:10.825 --> 01:49:13.987]  We can't even provide for our own people when a disaster strikes.
[01:49:14.167 --> 01:49:18.691]  And not only do we not provide for them, we go out of our way.
[01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:21.113]  FEMA goes out of its way to make things worse.
[01:49:21.314 --> 01:49:22.655]  I mean, you've got to wonder...
[01:49:23.055 --> 01:49:23.876]  What kind of people?
[01:49:23.916 --> 01:49:30.540]  You know, Brownie's more concerned about how his shirt looks than he is about people who are drowning in the streets of New Orleans.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.301]  Yeah, his bimbo secretary.
[01:49:32.321 --> 01:49:34.422]  Ooh, you look really sexy, baby.
[01:49:35.123 --> 01:49:35.983]  Oh, really, pumpkin?
[01:49:36.003 --> 01:49:38.305]  You got a dog sitter for me?
[01:49:38.745 --> 01:49:40.766]  What do I get to quit this stupid job?
[01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:43.188]  And these are the just-let-them-eat-cake crowd.
[01:49:43.248 --> 01:49:44.609]  Wayne Madsen, stay there, sir.
[01:49:44.649 --> 01:49:45.389]  Amazing interview.
[01:49:45.609 --> 01:49:47.170]  Want to come back and take a few calls?
[01:49:47.531 --> 01:49:49.071]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:49.112 --> 01:49:50.833]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:57.682]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.923 --> 01:49:59.503]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.843 --> 01:50:04.506]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.866 --> 01:50:11.569]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.929 --> 01:50:13.910]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:16.950]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:21.712]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.912 --> 01:50:26.313]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:33.775]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.035 --> 01:50:36.455]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.616 --> 01:50:38.356]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:50:39.237 --> 01:50:44.504]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit Infowars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[01:50:54.571 --> 01:50:57.554]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.915 --> 01:51:06.724]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:07.064 --> 01:51:11.749]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:18.912]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.312 --> 01:51:31.017]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.577 --> 01:51:36.042]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:36.203 --> 01:51:38.665]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:38.686 --> 01:51:40.347]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:40.407 --> 01:51:41.789]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.809 --> 01:51:43.271]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:44.332]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:55.276 --> 01:52:01.198]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.438 --> 01:52:03.679]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.879 --> 01:52:10.221]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.621 --> 01:52:10.861]  I think.
[01:52:30.831 --> 01:52:31.432]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.209 --> 01:53:02.233]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.834 --> 01:53:05.816]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:23.848 --> 01:53:30.930]  So about the Globalist Master Plan, why these guys are doing this, what their final goal is, is an important question a caller raised a few days ago.
[01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:39.093]  I can't spend a few minutes on it or do it without having all the notes because it's a very important subject and it goes into the psychology and what drives this whole thing.
[01:53:39.393 --> 01:53:41.774]  My film, Martial Law, covers a lot of that.
[01:53:42.637 --> 01:53:42.697]  1-888-253-3139
[01:54:12.603 --> 01:54:29.990]  Oh, and incidentally, on PrisonPlanet.tv, which we've had up and running for a year and a half with all my videos and my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV shows, my best audio interviews with our best guests like Mr. Madsen, you've not been able to sign up since yesterday for memberships because we moved the servers.
[01:54:30.726 --> 01:54:35.629]  To an even bigger pipe and a better quality system because it's grown.
[01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:40.933]  So it's got to propagate on the web and you should be able to sign up in the next few hours there.
[01:54:41.653 --> 01:54:43.374]  The content is there for all the members right now.
[01:54:43.834 --> 01:54:47.157]  We're mirroring it on two servers right now, two separate places.
[01:54:47.197 --> 01:54:48.537]  But that's all technical.
[01:54:48.597 --> 01:54:51.259]  The point is prisonplanet.tv is there for you as well.
[01:54:51.759 --> 01:54:52.940]  Being upgraded and being...
[01:54:54.581 --> 01:54:57.724]  Expanded and made better at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:57.744 --> 01:54:59.085]  So sign up and get a membership today.
[01:54:59.105 --> 01:55:00.286]  15 cents a day.
[01:55:00.346 --> 01:55:00.946]  It's a great deal.
[01:55:00.966 --> 01:55:02.668]  It makes this broadcast possible.
[01:55:03.488 --> 01:55:04.449]  Going back to Wayne Madsen.
[01:55:04.829 --> 01:55:08.032]  He's going to stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour to take your calls.
[01:55:08.132 --> 01:55:09.393]  The folks that are holding right now.
[01:55:09.793 --> 01:55:10.774]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:15.587 --> 01:55:23.372]  And it's very important to support people who are telling the truth and not being cowards and defending this nation from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:55:23.412 --> 01:55:26.954]  And Wayne Madsen has certainly done that for his entire career in and out of government.
[01:55:27.314 --> 01:55:33.538]  Wayne's got a new book coming out the first of the year, but right now you've got a couple other great books, some of them bestsellers.
[01:55:33.899 --> 01:55:36.120]  Tell folks about some of those titles and where they can get them.
[01:55:38.479 --> 01:55:49.561]  John Stanton called America's Nightmare, the presidency of George Bush II, basically a compilation of various monographs written individually and stuff we wrote together.
[01:55:49.581 --> 01:55:52.362]  Because we saw a lot of this coming back in 2001.
[01:55:52.642 --> 01:55:56.223]  The warning signs were there.
[01:55:56.783 --> 01:56:06.105]  And unfortunately, back then, a lot of people ignored where this administration was going to eventually take us.
[01:56:06.225 --> 01:56:06.845]  And we had 9-11 in it.
[01:56:07.938 --> 01:56:12.099]  Of course, I think everything after 9-11 spoke for itself.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.701]  They pushed a lot of things through, Patriot Act and other things.
[01:56:16.841 --> 01:56:19.002]  You've also got a new book coming out.
[01:56:19.042 --> 01:56:19.622]  Tell us about that.
[01:56:19.882 --> 01:56:22.523]  Jaded Task.
[01:56:22.603 --> 01:56:24.443]  I didn't come up with the name Jaded Task.
[01:56:24.504 --> 01:56:25.264]  The Army did.
[01:56:25.864 --> 01:56:28.585]  That was the Army's code name for the...
[01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:40.676]  Operation that got rid of President Aristide, democratically elected president of Haiti, where he was actually kidnapped in the middle of the night and flown to Africa by U.S.
[01:56:40.756 --> 01:56:41.617]  private mercenaries.
[01:56:41.637 --> 01:56:42.577]  And it was so obvious.
[01:56:42.597 --> 01:56:45.459]  There's these blonde-haired, blue-eyed Delta Force types behind him.
[01:56:45.639 --> 01:56:47.120]  There's the kidnappers getting on U.S.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:47.900]  aircraft.
[01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:48.601]  That's right.
[01:56:48.661 --> 01:56:56.706]  And I think one of the things I show is these private military contractors, I call them mercenaries, we've always called them mercenaries, are now
[01:56:57.233 --> 01:57:01.835]  Basically, they're the new international military force.
[01:57:02.476 --> 01:57:04.157]  They're all throughout Iraq.
[01:57:04.377 --> 01:57:07.318]  We've got people who committed war crimes in Serbia.
[01:57:07.438 --> 01:57:12.601]  And Bush is setting the precedent to have these international mercs, many of them foreigners, operate here in America.
[01:57:13.021 --> 01:57:16.023]  He broke the ice big time there in New Orleans.
[01:57:16.363 --> 01:57:16.943]  That's right.
[01:57:17.003 --> 01:57:18.264]  And they're not wearing U.N.
[01:57:18.304 --> 01:57:18.744]  helmets.
[01:57:18.844 --> 01:57:21.706]  I know people said, oh, when it happens, it's going to be the U.N.
[01:57:21.726 --> 01:57:22.686]  helicopters.
[01:57:23.307 --> 01:57:23.867]  No, it's not.
[01:57:23.907 --> 01:57:25.468]  It's going to be people who are wearing...
[01:57:26.169 --> 01:57:29.792]  Military Guard, but they're going to be working for DOD.
[01:57:30.932 --> 01:57:31.453]  Stay there, sir.
[01:57:31.493 --> 01:57:32.113]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.514 --> 01:57:38.397]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.864 --> 01:57:50.504]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.165 --> 01:57:52.225]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.946 --> 01:57:54.066]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.706 --> 01:57:55.507]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.267 --> 01:57:57.788]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.848 --> 01:58:01.810]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:06.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.374 --> 01:58:10.134]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:58:10.894 --> 01:58:12.995]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:58:13.035 --> 01:58:14.476]  Links at Infowars.com.
[01:58:14.596 --> 01:58:16.057]  Wayne Madsen is an investigative journalist.
[01:58:16.827 --> 01:58:19.649]  Written for some of the biggest magazines and newspapers in the country.
[01:58:20.210 --> 01:58:21.170]  Madsen is a former U.S.
[01:58:21.190 --> 01:58:24.413]  Naval officer who was assigned to the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration.
[01:58:25.013 --> 01:58:25.914]  And then it goes on and on.
[01:58:25.954 --> 01:58:31.097]  He's also written the best-selling book concerning how to protect your personal data.
[01:58:31.117 --> 01:58:32.458]  We'll tell you more about that before he leaves us.
[01:58:32.478 --> 01:58:33.899]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:58:33.919 --> 01:58:34.580]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:40.184]  We're about to go to David and Ian and others that are holding.
[01:58:40.244 --> 01:58:41.825]  But Wayne, you were trying to finish up.
[01:58:42.689 --> 01:58:45.630]  Well, I just wanted to mention these private contractors.
[01:58:45.710 --> 01:58:47.710]  Blackwater USA we've heard a lot about.
[01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:52.851]  People may not know how tied in this private contractor is with the Republican Party.
[01:58:53.471 --> 01:59:02.773]  Blackwater is run by Eric Prince, whose sister is married to the DeVos family in Michigan, and they're the people that run Amway.
[01:59:04.313 --> 01:59:10.734]  Joseph Schmitz, who was the Inspector General for the Pentagon under Rumsfeld, is now the General Counsel for
[01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:12.390]  For Blackwater, USA.
[01:59:13.071 --> 01:59:22.698]  Joseph Schmitz, you may not know his sister by her maiden name, which was Mary Kay Schmitz, but you probably people would know her by her married name, Mary Kay Letourneau.
[01:59:23.558 --> 01:59:24.199]  One and the same.
[01:59:24.219 --> 01:59:29.823]  The woman who served time in jail for having sex with her 12-year-old student.
[01:59:31.404 --> 01:59:31.965]  Unbelievable.
[01:59:31.985 --> 01:59:32.685]  Family values.
[01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:35.748]  Well, they're totally obsessed with that type of behavior.
[01:59:35.788 --> 01:59:38.910]  Why do we see this crop up so much with this whole clan of people?
[01:59:39.726 --> 01:59:57.556]  You know, the mainstream media, I mean, they'll concentrate on missing girls in Aruba, but here we've got a Pentagon connection to Mary Kayla Tornow, a child molester, and that's just not even looked at, or nobody cares about that.
[01:59:58.542 --> 02:00:01.745]  Well, that's the intel we just keep getting everywhere on these sickos.
[02:00:02.606 --> 02:00:05.910]  I want to take some calls here, but I want to get back into the foreign troops situation.
[02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:07.271]  The president's been set.
[02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:09.353]  Foreign troops, foreign mercs from Israel.
[02:00:09.393 --> 02:00:11.055]  Blackwater's pretty much international.
[02:00:11.696 --> 02:00:17.342]  And that's the intel we got, was it was going to be private mercs just in gray or camo uniforms.
[02:00:17.762 --> 02:00:26.992]  Here they are, Mexican troops precedent set, Dutch troops precedent set, and all the good old boys aren't even aware of it now because it's not hypothetical, it's happening.
[02:00:27.372 --> 02:00:29.034]  Dave in Michigan, then Ian and others.
[02:00:29.054 --> 02:00:29.634]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:00:29.654 --> 02:00:30.435]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:30.876 --> 02:00:31.196]  Hi.
[02:00:31.636 --> 02:00:36.962]  Yeah, I recall to tell you that the hip-hop mayor of Detroit managed to get himself re-elected yesterday.
[02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:39.630]  Want me to kill Patrick?
[02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:40.750]  Well, we're all doomed.
[02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:41.651]  What else is on your mind?
[02:00:41.671 --> 02:00:45.691]  Oh, the one that wanted me to make the text on hamburgers to tell you how to run your life?
[02:00:45.951 --> 02:00:46.892]  I remember, yes.
[02:00:47.192 --> 02:00:50.752]  And I don't believe it with all these little electronic voting machines.
[02:00:51.132 --> 02:00:56.693]  It's like 90-plus percent of people were against these toll roads, but one of the initiatives passed, one of them failed.
[02:00:56.753 --> 02:00:58.414]  I mean, that's a question for Wayne.
[02:00:58.434 --> 02:00:59.574]  Wayne, you worked at the NSA.
[02:00:59.934 --> 02:01:05.115]  I mean, these electronic voting machines have been caught over and over again running frauds.
[02:01:07.096 --> 02:01:10.778]  How do you have 90 plus percent of people against something, but it still passes?
[02:01:11.079 --> 02:01:11.719]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:11.799 --> 02:01:21.885]  And as anybody at NSA will tell you, and NSA has looked into issues of electronic voting, especially in Maryland, where they're headquartered.
[02:01:22.306 --> 02:01:28.069]  But, yeah, I mean, it's so easy to write a little bit of code that flip-flops the election.
[02:01:28.169 --> 02:01:32.252]  And we've got an issue here with a very close race where we had the governor say,
[02:01:33.317 --> 02:01:41.822]  Tim Kaine won the governor's race by a wide margin, but the lieutenant governor and more so the attorney general are just so close.
[02:01:42.182 --> 02:01:45.304]  Here we go again, like the 2000 election in Florida.
[02:01:45.724 --> 02:01:49.966]  Elections shouldn't be this close, and you have to ask, why are they?
[02:01:50.026 --> 02:01:51.627]  Is there some sort of manipulation?
[02:01:51.947 --> 02:01:55.449]  And as we know that the voting machine companies, ES&S, Diebold,
[02:01:56.569 --> 02:02:02.893]  The others are all owned by this very small group, consortium, all tied with one political party.
[02:02:02.993 --> 02:02:06.776]  So you've got to wonder what's going on behind the scenes.
[02:02:07.884 --> 02:02:12.688]  These elections, especially statewide and national elections, just should not be this close.
[02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:12.928]  Exactly.
[02:02:12.948 --> 02:02:14.450]  We've had enough of too many of them.
[02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:16.752]  Dave, anything else?
[02:02:16.832 --> 02:02:30.604]  Well, in Detroit, there's 920,000 people, and they had 300,000 voters registered on vacant lots in rest homes that hadn't voted for 10 years that finished the cast ballot yesterday.
[02:02:30.624 --> 02:02:33.626]  Well, that's good old-fashioned Democratic fraud there.
[02:02:33.786 --> 02:02:34.387]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:34.407 --> 02:02:34.987]  They had the...
[02:02:36.161 --> 02:02:38.562]  FBI's impounded all the absentee ballots.
[02:02:39.483 --> 02:02:39.823]  Ha, ha.
[02:02:40.303 --> 02:02:41.964]  All right.
[02:02:42.224 --> 02:02:44.985]  We'll come back and talk to Ian in Ontario, Canada.
[02:02:45.426 --> 02:02:46.986]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.146 --> 02:02:50.228]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.368 --> 02:02:54.270]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:58.572]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:58.892 --> 02:03:02.654]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.814 --> 02:03:04.615]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.795 --> 02:03:08.097]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.137 --> 02:03:12.860]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:16.041]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.242 --> 02:03:19.143]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[02:03:19.583 --> 02:03:25.707]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.227 --> 02:03:28.069]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:50.633]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:50.994 --> 02:03:55.077]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.378 --> 02:03:55.918]  We listened.
[02:03:56.238 --> 02:04:01.223]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.483 --> 02:04:01.964]  We listened.
[02:04:02.364 --> 02:04:05.407]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.827 --> 02:04:06.368]  We listened.
[02:04:06.828 --> 02:04:09.971]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:04:10.211 --> 02:04:10.771]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.715 --> 02:04:39.140]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.005 --> 02:04:47.626]  Government affects what governs me.
[02:04:48.167 --> 02:04:49.468]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:49.928 --> 02:04:52.610]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:55.732]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:56.153 --> 02:05:02.638]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:25.071 --> 02:05:25.431]  Have you?
[02:05:26.011 --> 02:05:27.512]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:38.962]  Osama been forgotten.

[02:05:50.072 --> 02:05:50.713]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.373 --> 02:05:52.434]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.135 --> 02:05:54.276]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.896 --> 02:05:55.717]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.478 --> 02:05:57.318]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.039 --> 02:06:02.022]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.222 --> 02:06:06.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.486 --> 02:06:07.407]  Music
[02:06:14.904 --> 02:06:19.026]  We have mass looting going on of every sector of the economy.
[02:06:19.506 --> 02:06:26.950]  Classical police state systems and mechanisms are being erected in the criminal elements of the government.
[02:06:27.603 --> 02:06:29.083]  It's been hijacked by private interest.
[02:06:29.223 --> 02:06:31.404]  Openly say it's for martial law.
[02:06:31.784 --> 02:06:33.865]  Openly talk about forced labor camps.
[02:06:34.305 --> 02:06:39.646]  Their mouthpieces on talk radio push for putting anybody in prison that, quote, disagrees with the government.
[02:06:40.007 --> 02:06:44.068]  The IRS is going after churches and saying you can't ever have an anti-war sermon.
[02:06:44.108 --> 02:06:44.848]  That's political.
[02:06:45.553 --> 02:06:50.055]  I mean, it's just wholesale attacks on freedom that are going on right now.
[02:06:50.075 --> 02:06:54.476]  We're talking to Wayne Madsen, who worked there at the NSA, about a host of issues.
[02:06:55.237 --> 02:06:56.917]  And we're going to take a few more of your calls now.
[02:06:56.977 --> 02:06:58.558]  That number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:05.541]  Ian in Ontario, Canada, you're on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[02:07:06.261 --> 02:07:07.061]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:07:07.161 --> 02:07:11.663]  A quick comment about Rector Ted, and then a question for your guest, Wayne.
[02:07:12.873 --> 02:07:19.855]  Rector Ted and the listening audience shouldn't surrender the terms of reference in the debate on church and state.
[02:07:20.175 --> 02:07:21.255]  That was an hour and a half ago.
[02:07:21.275 --> 02:07:24.396]  Why don't you fill folks in on what we were talking about in the first hour?
[02:07:25.456 --> 02:07:32.058]  That Rector Ted, his church, if the government was going to...
[02:07:34.871 --> 02:07:44.715]  IRS was going to challenge a sermon that was given by a guest and former rector at his church, and they'd lose their tax-free status.
[02:07:44.955 --> 02:07:46.256]  Well, he's given the...
[02:07:48.357 --> 02:07:54.522]  It was Reverend George Rodriguez that gave the sermon, and it didn't even say who to vote for.
[02:07:54.542 --> 02:07:58.446]  It just said, this war is wrong, and now that's not even allowed.
[02:07:58.506 --> 02:07:59.186]  That's evil.
[02:07:59.667 --> 02:08:03.330]  And look, the First Amendment says the government shouldn't be involved in what churches are saying and doing, period.
[02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:04.611]  They can make no law.
[02:08:05.491 --> 02:08:11.035]  Well, certainly if we go back and look at what happened in Nazi Germany, it was okay for clerics to preach politics from the pulpit,
[02:08:31.269 --> 02:08:36.952]  As long as they espouse the ideas of the Nazis and Adolf Hitler.
[02:08:36.992 --> 02:08:38.313]  The same thing with China today.
[02:08:38.513 --> 02:08:39.453]  That's right.
[02:08:39.573 --> 02:08:51.340]  It was those clergymen like Pastor Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemöller who, when they condemned the Nazis, they were hauled off to concentration camps and their churches were closed down.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:54.782]  So, yeah, we've seen all this kind of thing happen before.
[02:08:54.882 --> 02:08:57.283]  And I think it's just another indication how...
[02:08:57.785 --> 02:09:01.168]  How right-wing and radical these people that have taken over our government are.
[02:09:01.568 --> 02:09:09.575]  Gentlemen, it's not about the separation of church and state, whether the enemy of truth is the phony left or the phony right.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:13.863]  And this is the point that you have to make in this kind of debate.
[02:09:14.283 --> 02:09:18.846]  What they really want, and listen for it, is separation of conscience and state.
[02:09:19.146 --> 02:09:24.570]  Because conscience is the personal authority which demands truth in the heart of every human being.
[02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:25.971]  Well, I'll just boil it down.
[02:09:26.151 --> 02:09:32.955]  In America and anywhere else, we call it tyranny when the government's going around telling preachers that they can't give a speech against war.
[02:09:33.436 --> 02:09:36.938]  I'll give a speech if I'm a preacher or I'm a daffy duck.
[02:09:37.378 --> 02:09:39.260]  I mean, this is just a base of liberty.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:39.940]  And notice,
[02:09:40.981 --> 02:09:45.325]  It's systematic.
[02:09:45.405 --> 02:09:46.526]  It's system-wide.
[02:09:46.826 --> 02:09:48.187]  It's systemic, Wayne.
[02:09:48.808 --> 02:09:49.789]  Well, it's true.
[02:09:49.869 --> 02:09:52.691]  And I think if the IRS chooses to...
[02:09:54.094 --> 02:09:56.936]  Take away the tax status of the church.
[02:09:57.076 --> 02:09:59.938]  You know, I mean, people can live with that.
[02:09:59.998 --> 02:10:10.006]  And I think, and if the IRS does that, I think maybe we need a tax moratorium and people, millions and millions of people should just refuse to send in those forms April 15th.
[02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:12.917]  Well, I mean, this is a commissariat.
[02:10:12.937 --> 02:10:14.258]  We talk about communism.
[02:10:14.278 --> 02:10:21.782]  Hugo Chavez is giving government lands back to the people with deeds of title and divesting government fascist interests, basically.
[02:10:22.042 --> 02:10:25.684]  It's really free market, what he's doing, in the great spirit of America.
[02:10:26.444 --> 02:10:34.431]  And meanwhile, our government's got the Supreme Court saying private interest, if they've got more money than you, can lobby the local robber baron to steal your property.
[02:10:34.491 --> 02:10:36.512]  I mean, it's at every level.
[02:10:36.753 --> 02:10:43.918]  Well, somebody's got to be able to take those state-owned lands in places like Florida and build nice homes for people like Karl Rove, after all.
[02:10:44.879 --> 02:10:47.381]  Wayne, my question is about Chavez.
[02:10:47.401 --> 02:10:48.442]  Yes.
[02:10:49.463 --> 02:10:55.628]  You may not know it, but Larry Nichols, Clinton's public relations director and the Arkansas governor's office...
[02:10:56.255 --> 02:11:02.860]  It tells us that Clinton tried to give him a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf because he thought it was a great political manifesto.
[02:11:03.241 --> 02:11:08.245]  And of course Castro was renowned as a young revolutionary lawyer for his copy of Mein Kampf.
[02:11:08.865 --> 02:11:19.313]  What these ostensibly left-wing socialists admired about it was that Hitler, the young revolutionary, accomplished his revolution through the instruments of
[02:11:20.384 --> 02:11:23.707]  Well, I think if we look at his background, first he did try to take over power in a
[02:11:44.588 --> 02:11:54.475]  Yeah, let me try to boil this down.
[02:11:54.856 --> 02:12:04.523]  Look, that's why the communists are so bad, is they go into areas where things are bad and there's corruption, and then they pose as the solution when all they're going to do is set up a new form of centralization.
[02:12:04.803 --> 02:12:10.548]  So a lot of people throughout history, when they're young, when they're 20 years old and just a street peasant,
[02:12:10.968 --> 02:12:15.172]  Of course they're going to be recruited at some point by that system.
[02:12:15.412 --> 02:12:17.453]  But he totally has gone the other direction.
[02:12:17.694 --> 02:12:20.416]  He gives speeches about the New World Order, about the bankers.
[02:12:21.116 --> 02:12:23.418]  I mean, this guy talks about the globalists.
[02:12:23.438 --> 02:12:25.440]  He talks about the one world government.
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.982]  Believe me, they hate his guts for real.
[02:12:28.802 --> 02:12:29.443]  Wayne, do you agree with that?
[02:12:29.463 --> 02:12:30.203]  Well, that's right.
[02:12:30.283 --> 02:12:35.788]  And he also, he's gaining a lot of supporters in other countries than Latin America.
[02:12:35.928 --> 02:12:37.229]  Evo Morales, who's running...
[02:12:37.788 --> 02:12:43.972]  For President of Bolivia, it says the same things about what's happening in Bolivia as Chavez says in Venezuela.
[02:12:43.992 --> 02:12:45.853]  Let's give the land back to the people.
[02:12:46.154 --> 02:12:53.058]  Morales used to be the head of the coca farmers union in Bolivia, so you can see where he's going to be going.
[02:12:53.078 --> 02:12:58.742]  He's going to say, wait a minute, these are these people's livelihoods, and why should we have the Yankees
[02:12:59.278 --> 02:13:08.441]  Up in North America, declaring what we've grown here for hundreds and hundreds of years to be illegal when it's a part of our economy.
[02:13:08.821 --> 02:13:10.142]  All right, thank you for the call, Ian.
[02:13:10.162 --> 02:13:12.822]  Let's move on now to Tony in New York.
[02:13:13.183 --> 02:13:14.083]  Tony, you're on the air.
[02:13:14.123 --> 02:13:14.563]  Go ahead.
[02:13:14.583 --> 02:13:16.684]  Hi, great show.
[02:13:17.084 --> 02:13:19.385]  Two questions, and I'll take the answer off the air.
[02:13:20.145 --> 02:13:23.526]  Can you talk in depth more about the Shalaby connection?
[02:13:23.586 --> 02:13:26.427]  Why is he back in the picture when he allegedly stole...
[02:13:27.535 --> 02:13:28.235]  $300 million.
[02:13:28.275 --> 02:13:29.196]  No, allegedly.
[02:13:29.236 --> 02:13:30.237]  He was convicted of that.
[02:13:31.358 --> 02:13:36.603]  And can you also clarify, there's rumor going on that Scooter Levy is the stone of G. Gorton Liddy.
[02:13:36.924 --> 02:13:37.624]  Thank you very much.
[02:13:38.425 --> 02:13:39.026]  Oh, man.
[02:13:39.086 --> 02:13:39.706]  Oh, boy.
[02:13:39.746 --> 02:13:40.427]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:40.447 --> 02:13:49.076]  Well, and Chalabi, yeah, he's back in his country because, obviously, the neocons are still basically in charge of this administration.
[02:13:49.136 --> 02:13:51.458]  He's meeting with the National Security Advisor, Hadley.
[02:13:51.809 --> 02:13:55.370]  He's meeting with Condoleezza Rice.
[02:13:55.410 --> 02:13:56.930]  He's meeting with Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:13:56.990 --> 02:14:02.411]  So it's an indication that Fitzgerald's work, he still has a lot of work ahead of him.
[02:14:03.131 --> 02:14:04.512]  He got this one guy, Libby.
[02:14:04.572 --> 02:14:10.873]  Now, as far as Libby, as far as I know, Libby... He's too old, number one.
[02:14:11.533 --> 02:14:12.573]  Yeah, he's too old.
[02:14:12.853 --> 02:14:16.574]  But the thing is, Libby, I think the name was changed from...
[02:14:17.725 --> 02:14:20.707]  It's original Leibowitz, and they shortened it to Libby.
[02:14:21.347 --> 02:14:33.754]  Libby was also, the one connection is that he was the lawyer for Mark Rich, the international fugitive who Clinton pardoned in the 11th hour, and Clinton said later that he wished he hadn't done that.
[02:14:33.894 --> 02:14:36.475]  Yeah, we're talking about Mossad operatives.
[02:14:36.515 --> 02:14:44.239]  This is Mark Rich who's been likened as the Don Corleone of the Russian-Ukrainian-Israeli mafia, that he's the guy in charge.
[02:14:46.793 --> 02:14:53.735]  And again, you're a former NSA officer and a Navy officer, worked with Ronald Reagan, and you're just trying to defend our sovereignty.
[02:14:53.755 --> 02:14:56.076]  And we're the good guys, folks.
[02:14:56.116 --> 02:14:59.497]  We're against this pack of criminals raping this country.
[02:14:59.577 --> 02:15:00.417]  I'm sick of it.
[02:15:01.237 --> 02:15:01.798]  Well, that's right.
[02:15:01.838 --> 02:15:09.840]  I mean, as I say, if I saw this happening to the country in the 1980s, I would have said, hey, we've been infiltrated.
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:11.200]  We've got a fifth column.
[02:15:11.841 --> 02:15:15.962]  We've got people that are obviously trying to destroy the nation from within and
[02:15:17.104 --> 02:15:18.506]  I would have been appalled at this.
[02:15:18.906 --> 02:15:22.489]  Unfortunately, this is happening now.
[02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:26.012]  Very few people in the government are complaining about it.
[02:15:26.092 --> 02:15:33.398]  Those who do take a stand are viciously attacked, like Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame.
[02:15:33.938 --> 02:15:37.981]  Do you ever get threatened yourself?
[02:15:38.322 --> 02:15:42.245]  I got one serious one where I decided to leave town for a couple of days.
[02:15:42.325 --> 02:15:44.467]  I just thought that was the proper thing to do.
[02:15:45.247 --> 02:15:47.249]  It came from a pretty reliable source.
[02:15:47.929 --> 02:15:50.531]  But it turns out it was just intimidation.
[02:15:50.571 --> 02:15:53.254]  It's intimidation like all the other intimidation.
[02:15:53.274 --> 02:15:54.515]  Yeah, I follow these punks.
[02:15:54.575 --> 02:15:55.655]  I mean, punks threaten.
[02:15:56.156 --> 02:15:58.518]  Well, that's right.
[02:15:58.578 --> 02:16:00.159]  It depends on where the threat comes from.
[02:16:00.179 --> 02:16:02.441]  Yeah, I get a lot of hateful email.
[02:16:02.481 --> 02:16:04.762]  Well, I think it's good as long as they're threatening.
[02:16:06.863 --> 02:16:08.444]  The times really do something, don't threaten it.
[02:16:09.044 --> 02:16:12.225]  Let's go ahead and talk to Francis in Brooklyn.
[02:16:12.265 --> 02:16:13.205]  Francis, you're on the air.
[02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:13.525]  Welcome.
[02:16:13.545 --> 02:16:14.545]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:16:14.565 --> 02:16:16.266]  Hi.
[02:16:16.526 --> 02:16:27.229]  I found the discussion most interesting, but I wanted to raise a question, and that is, during the 1970s, we had a number of laws that Congress had enacted.
[02:16:27.867 --> 02:16:33.329]  For all individuals in government concerning conflicts of interest and assets being placed in blind trust.
[02:16:33.689 --> 02:16:35.329]  Yeah, this is all being selectively enforced.
[02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.729]  Correct.
[02:16:36.109 --> 02:16:52.074]  Now, I know in 1980, or in 1981, when Casey was made director of the CIA, he refused actually to have his assets in a blind trust because he was doing all sorts of investing and different things.
[02:16:52.174 --> 02:16:53.054]  And no one really...
[02:16:53.661 --> 02:16:55.101]  ...enforced it at that point.
[02:16:55.242 --> 02:17:02.844]  Why can't, as a check and balance, why can't John Q. Public enforce these laws?
[02:17:03.104 --> 02:17:12.367]  And if that were the case, all of the cabinet officers, including the vice president and our president, would be indicted and...
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:15.361]  I tell you what, we've got a break.
[02:17:15.561 --> 02:17:17.121]  Wayne, can you do a five more minutes?
[02:17:17.141 --> 02:17:18.102]  Sure, no problem.
[02:17:18.122 --> 02:17:19.022]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[02:17:19.062 --> 02:17:20.083]  Well, Francis, are you done?
[02:17:20.103 --> 02:17:21.323]  No, no, I'm still here.
[02:17:21.643 --> 02:17:23.404]  Well, I'll hold you over if you're not done with the question.
[02:17:23.704 --> 02:17:24.564]  And the second... Oh, yeah.
[02:17:24.584 --> 02:17:25.085]  Well, stay there.
[02:17:25.125 --> 02:17:26.125]  We'll come back to you, is what I'm saying.
[02:17:26.785 --> 02:17:33.088]  And we've got a little five-minute segment, and then we'll talk about some of the toll road business and hit a few other news items in the last 30 minutes of the show.
[02:17:33.108 --> 02:17:33.448]  But we'll do...
[02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:39.411]  Five more minutes after this break with our great guest, Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.org.
[02:17:39.731 --> 02:17:42.813]  I'm Alex Jones, President of Planet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[02:17:43.093 --> 02:17:43.833]  Check him out today.
[02:17:51.356 --> 02:17:54.598]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:17:55.338 --> 02:17:56.679]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:17:59.699 --> 02:18:05.161]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:05.582 --> 02:18:08.723]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:08.983 --> 02:18:10.384]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:10.664 --> 02:18:13.905]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:16.667]  Here is reality.
[02:18:17.027 --> 02:18:20.628]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:18:21.108 --> 02:18:24.750]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:27.891]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[02:18:29.491 --> 02:18:29.752]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.939 --> 02:18:46.319]  We're good to go.
[02:19:07.318 --> 02:19:08.039]  We're good to go.
[02:19:22.655 --> 02:19:23.536]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[02:19:23.576 --> 02:19:23.876]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[02:19:46.184 --> 02:19:46.864]  Hello, folks.

[02:20:34.506 --> 02:20:35.948]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[02:20:35.968 --> 02:20:37.109]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:41.815]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, A Second Look at the Federal Reserve...
[02:20:55.151 --> 02:21:01.177]  I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[02:21:01.738 --> 02:21:04.280]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:21:05.181 --> 02:21:09.746]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:21:10.342 --> 02:21:15.064]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:21:15.604 --> 02:21:34.213]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:34.773 --> 02:21:39.575]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll-free...
[02:21:42.924 --> 02:21:43.064]  888-421-6181.
[02:21:46.346 --> 02:21:49.087]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.107 --> 02:21:53.029]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:57.391]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:59.292 --> 02:22:02.273]  Defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[02:22:03.734 --> 02:22:06.015]  Wayne Madsen, our guest, final segment.
[02:22:07.173 --> 02:22:08.674]  With this guest, another guest coming up.
[02:22:08.794 --> 02:22:10.174]  Talk about the toll roads, very important.
[02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:14.036]  The smattering of other important news items we need to recap but haven't covered yet.
[02:22:15.077 --> 02:22:18.038]  But Francis in Brooklyn, finishing up your question briefly.
[02:22:18.378 --> 02:22:32.845]  Yes, that really was it because what surprised me about this, well it really didn't surprise me, but the run-up to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, none of the questions were really answered.
[02:22:33.365 --> 02:22:34.446]  And having been...
[02:22:35.891 --> 02:22:42.596]  You know, around during the Vietnam War, it's just as if all of those deaths were wasted.
[02:22:43.076 --> 02:22:44.397]  It's awful to say that.
[02:22:44.657 --> 02:22:45.198]  Sure, sure.
[02:22:45.278 --> 02:22:47.960]  And then they'll just put in a new group of puppets and do it again and again and again.
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:49.461]  No one's ever held accountable.
[02:22:49.781 --> 02:22:51.602]  I mean, how do we hold these people accountable?
[02:22:52.683 --> 02:22:58.227]  Well, as far as RICO statutes, yes, the Securities and Exchange Commission...
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:06.902]  They're not doing their job, just like the EPA and all these other regulatory agencies of the government have been totally emaciated by Mr. Bush.
[02:23:07.362 --> 02:23:14.864]  Some people have suggested a civil RICO being brought as a class action suit by a bunch of American citizens.
[02:23:14.904 --> 02:23:16.964]  Well, I've seen stuff written about it.
[02:23:17.004 --> 02:23:19.885]  Well, those have been done, but the judges are all bought and paid for.
[02:23:19.905 --> 02:23:22.266]  They're all bought and paid for, and they get thrown out.
[02:23:22.366 --> 02:23:24.946]  So, yeah, I mean, it's tough.
[02:23:25.026 --> 02:23:27.387]  It's tough to work within the system right now, and...
[02:23:28.688 --> 02:23:38.852]  We've got Bush packing the court with all of his cronies, and obviously they're trying to do end runs around not only the courts, but the regulatory agencies.
[02:23:40.192 --> 02:23:52.537]  One of the things is, just a few months ago, one of the assistant chief litigators for the Securities and Exchange Commission was found bludgeoned to death in a cheap seedy motel room in Alexandria, Virginia.
[02:23:53.410 --> 02:24:03.813]  They said, you know, after a Harvard Law School graduate, up-and-coming guy, they said he started to hang, he quit his job at the SEC and started hanging around a couple of crackheads.
[02:24:04.274 --> 02:24:06.634]  You know, what about that story doesn't sound right?
[02:24:06.674 --> 02:24:08.435]  It's sort of like Marvin Bush's maid being...
[02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:09.341]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:09.421 --> 02:24:10.722]  I mean, one thing about... That's right.
[02:24:10.762 --> 02:24:11.563]  This administration has...
[02:24:24.777 --> 02:24:34.142]  Well, I want to take one final call from Annette in West Virginia, but it's been great, Wayne, and I want to get you back up in the near future.
[02:24:34.682 --> 02:24:49.109]  But for the cops out there driving along and people in government who believe this system is all perfect and it's not corrupt, or even if it is, it's still our system, they need to understand that they're helping destroy this country when they turn a blind eye to all of this, and this is destroying their children's futures.
[02:24:49.529 --> 02:24:51.570]  Annette in West Virginia, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.930]  Go ahead.
[02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:52.851]  Yes.
[02:24:53.231 --> 02:25:00.317]  When Khrushchev was asked about communists in the United States, he said, oh, we don't call them communists, we call them liberals.
[02:25:01.518 --> 02:25:07.323]  And I found something interesting concerning the definition of a liberal.
[02:25:08.044 --> 02:25:13.428]  And if you look at the first letter of each word that I'm stating, it will spell liberal.
[02:25:13.909 --> 02:25:18.633]  Lacking in basic education, research, and logic.
[02:25:19.574 --> 02:25:20.574]  Yeah, I've heard that before.
[02:25:20.594 --> 02:25:33.337]  You know, I really think that whether it's communists, socialists, fascists, the neocons, the Clintonoids, it doesn't matter who it is, these are gangs of crooks who want to dominate and rule our lives and feed on us.
[02:25:33.437 --> 02:25:34.217]  It's called tyranny.
[02:25:34.237 --> 02:25:45.439]  Until 100 years ago, they taught freedom versus slavery in the colleges, and I think this whole liberal-conservative thing is a distraction in itself, false template, false map of the mind.
[02:25:45.699 --> 02:25:46.239]  Wayne Madsen?
[02:25:46.619 --> 02:25:49.902]  Well, George Orwell had that pretty well right in 1984.
[02:25:49.962 --> 02:25:57.209]  Remember, he wrote about the labels, the newspeak that came up that everybody was supposed to use.
[02:25:57.249 --> 02:26:03.215]  It was a great diversion to keep people's minds off of what was really happening.
[02:26:03.295 --> 02:26:09.361]  So labels are fine, but it's really, as you suggest, it's what's behind the labels.
[02:26:10.186 --> 02:26:20.548]  Neocons, neoliberals, we've got these Republican-in-name-only rhinos and Democrat-in-name-only dindinos.
[02:26:21.288 --> 02:26:23.909]  And the communists themselves funded by big money interests.
[02:26:23.989 --> 02:26:26.310]  You just wanted client dictators to deal with.
[02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:27.090]  Annette, anything else?
[02:26:28.770 --> 02:26:29.850]  Well, yes.
[02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:36.292]  I wish that you would make a distinction between finance capitalism and fascism.
[02:26:36.652 --> 02:26:37.652]  They're worlds apart.
[02:26:38.714 --> 02:26:42.898]  Well, I don't like... Ma'am, I've just pointed out crony capitalism is not free market.
[02:26:43.098 --> 02:26:43.998]  I am free market.
[02:26:44.339 --> 02:26:45.259]  And I totally agree with you.
[02:26:45.279 --> 02:26:46.420]  There's two separate things.
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:51.804]  But I mean, the so-called capitalists we hear about have financed every rotten thing you can imagine.
[02:26:52.065 --> 02:26:54.206]  As long as it centralizes power, they're behind it.
[02:26:54.246 --> 02:26:54.526]  Wayne?
[02:26:54.627 --> 02:26:55.567]  No, but wait a minute.
[02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:57.309]  Alex.
[02:26:57.529 --> 02:26:57.769]  Yes?
[02:26:57.929 --> 02:27:07.036]  Alex, what I'm saying is that the fascism in Germany and Italy is not what you call fascism here in the United States today.
[02:27:07.416 --> 02:27:09.157]  And what's growing in the West.
[02:27:09.677 --> 02:27:13.479]  And someday, I wish that you and I could personally talk about this.
[02:27:14.419 --> 02:27:15.120]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:17.181]  I'm going to let Wayne Madsen go.
[02:27:17.261 --> 02:27:18.621]  WayneMadsenReport.org.
[02:27:18.661 --> 02:27:20.402]  I'll let you briefly finish on the other side of that.
[02:27:20.622 --> 02:27:24.664]  Wayne, it was great having you on, and I really can't wait to have you back on again.
[02:27:25.064 --> 02:27:25.444]  You bet.
[02:27:25.484 --> 02:27:26.605]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:27:26.805 --> 02:27:27.325]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:27.405 --> 02:27:28.066]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:27:28.526 --> 02:27:30.667]  Okay, Annette, we'll let you finish briefly.
[02:27:30.687 --> 02:27:33.008]  I've got another guest coming up, but we'll get the guest on, too.
[02:27:36.006 --> 02:27:36.909]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.390 --> 02:27:38.995]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.918 --> 02:27:42.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.655 --> 02:27:49.037]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[02:29:57.597 --> 02:30:05.502]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.662 --> 02:30:12.707]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.927 --> 02:30:14.128]  There are no side effects.

[02:30:33.199 --> 02:30:34.161]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:52.122 --> 02:30:55.164]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[02:30:55.724 --> 02:30:58.347]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[02:30:58.367 --> 02:31:01.729]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[02:31:01.930 --> 02:31:04.732]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[02:31:05.032 --> 02:31:07.154]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[02:31:07.374 --> 02:31:09.596]  I know I'm working for the state.
[02:31:09.616 --> 02:31:11.577]  I'm the highway patrol.
[02:31:12.278 --> 02:31:13.159]  And don't forget...
[02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:17.342]  The state is God.
[02:31:17.402 --> 02:31:18.944]  They are the authorities.
[02:31:19.004 --> 02:31:22.167]  They are the officials.
[02:31:22.307 --> 02:31:31.995]  We are the serfs, the slaves, the peons, the civilians, whatever happened to government servants?
[02:31:33.196 --> 02:31:35.338]  My dad's dad held a few political offices.
[02:31:36.492 --> 02:31:39.674]  Out in the countryside, but he just did it to cut taxes and leave people alone.
[02:31:39.694 --> 02:31:40.294]  He was loved for it.
[02:31:40.915 --> 02:31:43.956]  And people would call him a politician or they'd call him a Republican.
[02:31:44.557 --> 02:31:46.998]  And he'd say, don't you call me a politician.
[02:31:47.038 --> 02:31:47.799]  I'm a servant.
[02:31:48.599 --> 02:31:49.880]  I'm a public servant.
[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:50.800]  That was many years ago.
[02:31:51.081 --> 02:31:52.541]  Don't you call him a servant now.
[02:31:52.561 --> 02:31:58.145]  One time I called an obnoxious cop a servant at some government meeting locally in the neighborhood telling everybody to be tattletales.
[02:31:58.525 --> 02:32:00.686]  And he said, I pay taxes.
[02:32:00.746 --> 02:32:03.828]  I pay my own salary in front of a whole crowd of people.
[02:32:05.251 --> 02:32:07.513]  And so that's what I am.
[02:32:07.573 --> 02:32:08.674]  I pay for myself.
[02:32:08.694 --> 02:32:12.977]  I mean, it's just cuckoo, cuckoo, and we work for you, don't we?
[02:32:13.438 --> 02:32:14.458]  We're slaves.
[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:21.144]  Look, the whole thing is the bankers did fund communism, and that's just a historical fact.
[02:32:21.184 --> 02:32:26.608]  I mean, the KGB files have been released, and almost everybody McCarthy fingered was a communist and more.
[02:32:27.188 --> 02:32:29.890]  But McCarthy wasn't drunk on a power trip.
[02:32:31.492 --> 02:32:34.214]  Nobody's perfect, running around attacking a lot of innocent people.
[02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:37.691]  And his sniveling attorney.
[02:32:38.451 --> 02:32:44.453]  And when he figured the army and called them communists, which it was true, they were funding the communists, but it wasn't communism.
[02:32:44.793 --> 02:32:48.874]  Again, it isn't communists are taking America over and the Russians run everything.
[02:32:49.094 --> 02:32:54.456]  From the deep research I've done, it's that the international crime cartel has funded that, funded fascism.
[02:32:54.816 --> 02:32:55.556]  It's funded it all.
[02:32:55.716 --> 02:32:57.037]  Anything to consolidate power.
[02:32:57.477 --> 02:32:59.378]  Communism doesn't exist, the term we hear of it.
[02:32:59.738 --> 02:33:00.778]  It's just slavery, folks.
[02:33:03.408 --> 02:33:04.749]  Good night and good luck.
[02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:09.614]  Edward R. Murrow tonight, brought to you by Kent Cigarettes.
[02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:13.998]  People go see that movie, and oh, Evil McCarthy, oh, wonderful Edward R. Murrow.
[02:33:14.398 --> 02:33:21.825]  Why would CBS, openly owned by the Military Industrial Complex, openly owned by the defense contractors, even more than it is today, attack him?
[02:33:22.425 --> 02:33:24.107]  Why would the establishment do that?
[02:33:24.867 --> 02:33:26.749]  If they were just a little underdogs.
[02:33:27.470 --> 02:33:28.791]  Because it's baloney.
[02:33:30.214 --> 02:33:33.919]  The anti-communist movement was actually used to set up a police state in America.
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:37.684]  So all this stuff's been infiltrated and taken over.
[02:33:38.886 --> 02:33:40.448]  And I just get past all the terms.
[02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:45.134]  Now, Annette from West Virginia, you wanted to tell us, were you going to tell me?
[02:33:45.194 --> 02:33:47.417]  Well, to put things in a proper framework...
[02:33:48.007 --> 02:33:50.190]  Why did Hitler call himself a National Socialist?
[02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:17.319]  He was a nationalist, and the word socialist, as it was used and incorporated in taking care of Germany, had an entirely different effect.
[02:34:17.579 --> 02:34:19.781]  They actually did things for the people.
[02:34:20.041 --> 02:34:21.923]  They created the Audubon.
[02:34:21.943 --> 02:34:23.464]  They killed all the retarded children.
[02:34:23.484 --> 02:34:24.204]  They sterilized people.
[02:34:24.264 --> 02:34:24.705]  Just one moment.
[02:34:24.725 --> 02:34:26.446]  They knew the whole New World Order plan.
[02:34:33.772 --> 02:34:34.453]  We're good to go.
[02:34:53.425 --> 02:35:03.929]  All the people that it takes to take care of retarded children, they started to put them to death mercifully, but the Catholic Church stopped that, and that was okay.
[02:35:04.329 --> 02:35:19.274]  What I'm trying to say is this, that communism is the creation of Talmudic Judaism under the six-pointed star, and you could be any nationality or any race, because it's a seed line, and
[02:35:19.898 --> 02:35:20.418]  Yeah, listen.
[02:35:42.037 --> 02:35:43.398]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:35:44.138 --> 02:35:51.740]  I know all about British royal Israelism and seed lines and the Christian identity and all of it.
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:36:05.065]  And every group, that black professor saying kill all the whites, blacks are the God race, and then you've got the Jews saying they're the God race, and you've got the Aryans saying they're the God race, and you've got the
[02:36:05.812 --> 02:36:14.500]  Met your crowd who's Native Americans, Native Southern North Americans mixed with Spanish seed line saying they're the mythical god race.
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:20.965]  And I've got the mayor, Gus Garcia, saying they're the god race in a ritual at the city council on TV.
[02:36:20.985 --> 02:36:22.066]  I mean, I have this video.
[02:36:22.086 --> 02:36:23.247]  I put it on my local TV show.
[02:36:23.788 --> 02:36:24.749]  I've got to air that again.
[02:36:24.769 --> 02:36:28.612]  There's no time to put all this together or do all this or cover all this.
[02:36:28.692 --> 02:36:29.213]  And I just...
[02:36:31.016 --> 02:36:35.097]  Queen of England says that she is from the tribe of Judah.
[02:36:35.137 --> 02:36:39.338]  She gets coronated on the stone where Abraham supposedly almost sacrificed Isaac.
[02:36:40.118 --> 02:36:47.980]  And I just, you know, it goes off into the whole netherworld of an area that I just can't give my show over to it.
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:53.701]  Now, I did give you two minutes in the last segment, and what, three minutes just then, or no, four minutes.
[02:36:53.981 --> 02:36:56.081]  I was timing it to say your piece.
[02:36:56.682 --> 02:36:57.842]  I'm sure you're a very nice person.
[02:37:00.234 --> 02:37:01.735]  I try to expose all this evil.
[02:37:02.235 --> 02:37:04.336]  I try to expose all these tribalist groups.
[02:37:04.456 --> 02:37:08.138]  I try to expose what they're all doing to be equal and fair about it.
[02:37:08.879 --> 02:37:10.720]  We try to do what other people do not do.
[02:37:12.460 --> 02:37:15.422]  Yes, it would feel really good to say that I'm part of the God race.
[02:37:16.102 --> 02:37:17.303]  Of course, I'm corrupted.
[02:37:18.323 --> 02:37:21.205]  My mother's family is German and Alsatian.
[02:37:22.265 --> 02:37:24.527]  My dad's is English and Scotch-Irish.
[02:37:26.227 --> 02:37:28.008]  You know, and some Native Americans.
[02:37:28.048 --> 02:37:30.389]  So, see, I've got corrupt seed line, folks.
[02:37:30.510 --> 02:37:33.611]  I've got the seed of Cain.
[02:37:33.972 --> 02:37:36.113]  But I don't see myself bearing evil fruits.
[02:37:36.133 --> 02:37:41.176]  I don't see myself out doing all these evil things I'm supposed to do because I've got savage engine blood in me.
[02:37:41.996 --> 02:37:43.597]  I'm being sarcastic, New York Times.
[02:37:43.717 --> 02:37:46.459]  I know, Alex Jones calls Indians savages.
[02:37:46.579 --> 02:37:48.460]  I'm being sarcastic about myself, okay?
[02:37:50.784 --> 02:37:51.505]  And they know that.
[02:37:51.765 --> 02:37:54.806]  I've got to remember, I can't be sarcastic anymore.
[02:37:54.826 --> 02:37:57.187]  It's taken too seriously by too many people.
[02:38:00.988 --> 02:38:02.629]  Do we ever get a hold of Sal Costello?
[02:38:05.530 --> 02:38:16.134]  The Texas Toll Party had been knocking down my door to get on the show, and he wanted to come on and give us an update about beating some of the toll road stuff, some of it passing, which I don't buy any of that, folks.
[02:38:16.594 --> 02:38:17.514]  Everybody was against it.
[02:38:17.534 --> 02:38:19.515]  You couldn't find anybody for the toll roads, and
[02:38:20.103 --> 02:38:23.665]  One of the initiatives that kind of funds the whole thing still passed, but the big one didn't.
[02:38:25.066 --> 02:38:28.248]  So we did have a victory there with Prop 9 going down.
[02:38:28.868 --> 02:38:30.269]  Prop 1 did go through.
[02:38:31.210 --> 02:38:37.994]  But to kind of transfer more power to these unelected, unaccountable bureaucracies.
[02:38:38.014 --> 02:38:39.515]  You know what we'll do?
[02:38:39.535 --> 02:38:41.236]  We've got about 19 minutes left.
[02:38:41.256 --> 02:38:41.796]  Well, not about.
[02:38:41.836 --> 02:38:45.258]  Exactly 19 minutes left in transmission as I look at my atomic clock.
[02:38:45.278 --> 02:38:48.540]  41 minutes after the hour and 3 seconds exactly right now.
[02:38:50.074 --> 02:38:59.236]  I'll give the toll-free number out, and if you've got any questions or comments and quick comments, only because we'll never have time to get to the other people if we don't, the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:38:59.256 --> 02:38:59.456]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:38:59.476 --> 02:39:06.098]  And let's go ahead and do a little pluggy-wuggy here, and then I will go back and do your calls.
[02:39:20.407 --> 02:39:23.188]  Right now, I'm offering a whole bunch of new specials.
[02:39:23.208 --> 02:39:26.008]  We have the Alex Jones Police State Documentary Special.
[02:39:26.428 --> 02:39:28.669]  Three incredible classic films.
[02:39:28.729 --> 02:39:31.910]  Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:39:32.650 --> 02:39:33.650]  For $45.95, that's a $32 savings.
[02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:34.510]  Normally $25.95.
[02:39:34.590 --> 02:39:35.111]  A $45.95, a $32 savings.
[02:39:35.151 --> 02:39:36.351]  The DVD blowout, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:39:36.671 --> 02:39:38.251]  Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[02:39:38.311 --> 02:39:40.112]  Both of those are miniseries.
[02:39:50.738 --> 02:39:51.839]  American Dictators.
[02:39:52.019 --> 02:39:55.301]  All three of those films for $45.95.
[02:39:56.521 --> 02:39:59.323]  A $25 plus dollar savings.
[02:40:00.003 --> 02:40:01.144]  The 9-11 book special.
[02:40:01.184 --> 02:40:04.165]  My 9-11 book and Paul Watson's excellent Order Out of Chaos.
[02:40:04.225 --> 02:40:06.506]  Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[02:40:06.566 --> 02:40:09.348]  It covers a whole host of government sponsored terror and our master plan.
[02:40:09.408 --> 02:40:09.928]  It's excellent.
[02:40:10.488 --> 02:40:11.269]  Both of them for $19.95.
[02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:12.009]  So you save... What is it?
[02:40:12.049 --> 02:40:12.189]  Like...
[02:40:19.702 --> 02:40:24.144]  $11.
[02:40:19.902 --> 02:40:24.144]  And then we also have the amazing t-shirt deal.
[02:40:24.164 --> 02:40:25.185]  Get one t-shirt for $15, $5 discount.
[02:40:25.225 --> 02:40:26.165]  Get two for, what is it, $13.95 a piece.
[02:40:26.185 --> 02:40:26.566]  It's a $12 savings.
[02:40:26.586 --> 02:40:29.067]  And get three for $9.95 a piece, or...
[02:40:36.567 --> 02:40:38.288]  $29.95 over a $30 savings.
[02:40:38.308 --> 02:40:40.410]  We have the Defend the Second Amendment package.
[02:40:41.111 --> 02:40:45.574]  A classic Charlton Heston interview I did on CD, in CD format.
[02:40:46.135 --> 02:40:48.897]  The mass murderers agree gun control works.
[02:40:48.977 --> 02:40:52.260]  Politicians love Disarmed Peasants t-shirt in any size you wish.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:10.234]  And the JPFO, Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownership video, Innocence Portrayed on VHS or DVD, to wake folks up about the Second Amendment, and three Grandpa Jack comic books about the history of the Second Amendment written for the general level of the average American to wake up that friend or family member.
[02:41:10.274 --> 02:41:11.715]  It's written at a child's level.
[02:41:11.735 --> 02:41:14.257]  The government's done that to them, so you've got to reach them at that level.
[02:41:15.438 --> 02:41:15.658]  That's $44.95.
[02:41:15.698 --> 02:41:17.039]  You save a whole bunch on that.
[02:41:20.691 --> 02:41:28.094]  And then there's the Everything Else Special, every other book and video and thing I carry for an incredibly low price.
[02:41:28.214 --> 02:41:34.676]  And then we have the Everything Else Special, everything else Alex Jones Special, normally $320, $320.40, all 12 films, books, a bunch of stuff.
[02:41:34.696 --> 02:41:39.698]  That is only, and you get a free gift too when you get that, $179.
[02:41:40.298 --> 02:41:42.519]  And that is a, what's the savings on that?
[02:41:51.204 --> 02:41:51.444]  Over $140.

[02:41:58.046 --> 02:42:04.907]  I mean, I've got deals right now that are the lowest they've ever been by leaps and bounds and then another country mile.
[02:42:05.527 --> 02:42:07.108]  I mean, you need to take advantage of this.
[02:42:07.148 --> 02:42:08.588]  We just want to get the word out.
[02:42:08.968 --> 02:42:10.468]  We just want to wake people up.
[02:42:10.908 --> 02:42:12.189]  We just want to inform.
[02:42:12.249 --> 02:42:13.129]  Please get the films.
[02:42:13.189 --> 02:42:14.089]  Please make copies.
[02:42:14.569 --> 02:42:15.889]  Get them to your friends and family.
[02:42:16.390 --> 02:42:18.270]  They're having such a huge effect.

[02:43:00.556 --> 02:43:08.461]  And for those during the little hiccup of yesterday that couldn't be avoided as we transferred it to new servers, but now up and running for you, just a few hours of no service.
[02:43:10.602 --> 02:43:11.582]  So prisonplanet.tv.

[02:43:20.186 --> 02:43:21.367]  And I hope you'll do that.
[02:43:22.287 --> 02:43:24.548]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[02:43:24.668 --> 02:43:27.209]  Then I'm going to recap some news and cover some news we haven't gotten to.
[02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:28.290]  Who's up first there?
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:31.240]  Alex in Florida.
[02:43:31.340 --> 02:43:32.201]  You're up first.
[02:43:32.281 --> 02:43:32.641]  Welcome.
[02:43:33.061 --> 02:43:33.881]  Hello, Alex.
[02:43:34.001 --> 02:43:36.142]  Let me thank you for an outstanding show today.
[02:43:36.202 --> 02:43:37.082]  It's been terrific.
[02:43:37.402 --> 02:43:37.702]  Thank you.
[02:43:37.862 --> 02:43:39.323]  As always, you have interesting guests.
[02:43:39.783 --> 02:43:44.645]  But you just got finished plugging your movies, and actually the intention of my call was to do the same.
[02:43:45.485 --> 02:43:52.587]  And what I wanted to tell you is I've been a member for only about three weeks now, and I've been buying videos like Left and Right and giving them away.
[02:43:53.682 --> 02:43:59.924]  I've always considered myself a very informed person, and I always felt that I already knew all this stuff.
[02:44:00.064 --> 02:44:03.606]  Well, let me tell you folks, and you and everybody else, you don't know it all.
[02:44:03.666 --> 02:44:06.006]  You've got to see those videos.
[02:44:06.026 --> 02:44:16.210]  I think all of us, when we tend to talk to people, we like to preach to choir, talk to people that we think would be receptive to hearing this information or be inclined to believe it.
[02:44:16.590 --> 02:44:17.850]  But let me tell you something, Alex.
[02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:22.092]  The people that I've shown these videos to, like Order of Death and Martial Law,
[02:44:22.816 --> 02:44:30.178]  The people that I would assume would be the least receptive to hearing about this ended up being the most receptive.
[02:44:30.558 --> 02:44:34.080]  No, it's like shooting fish in a barrel right now.
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:35.740]  People have never been more receptive.
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:37.401]  It's incredible.
[02:44:37.481 --> 02:44:43.803]  I had one lady that actually worked for me, and I let her watch Order of Death, and then she came back and she wanted to see a couple more.
[02:44:44.223 --> 02:44:47.724]  And she came back to me and says, you know, the fog has cleared.
[02:44:48.706 --> 02:44:50.708]  And I'll never look at news the same way again.
[02:44:51.028 --> 02:44:51.809]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:44:51.829 --> 02:44:53.370]  And God bless you for what you're doing.
[02:44:53.410 --> 02:45:02.599]  I mean, that's literally the Lord's work to open people's eyes and expose the lies of the New World Order and the beast and the bully that goes around barking, trying to cower all of us.
[02:45:04.184 --> 02:45:08.486]  I mean, people are waking up, and everything makes sense once you know the truth.
[02:45:08.826 --> 02:45:10.227]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:18.011]  No, no, and I was just making a quick tour, and I said, well, what you've got to do next is start turning off Butch's Ministry of Truth, which is, of course, Fox News.
[02:45:18.411 --> 02:45:27.695]  And she says, yeah, I watched it last night, and after seeing a couple of those documentaries, I can see that it's just so obvious bull droppings.
[02:45:28.235 --> 02:45:31.537]  And this is a good Christian lady, too, and she doesn't usually use language like that.
[02:45:32.265 --> 02:45:34.927]  Well, it's upsetting to see what's happened.
[02:45:34.947 --> 02:45:36.648]  I really appreciate your call, Alex.
[02:45:37.509 --> 02:45:38.629]  God bless and Godspeed.
[02:45:38.689 --> 02:45:39.190]  Keep it up.
[02:45:39.250 --> 02:45:40.090]  That is exciting.
[02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:43.653]  Okay, I know there's a bunch of callers here, and I've got my call list out of order.
[02:45:43.813 --> 02:45:44.714]  Who's up next?
[02:45:46.935 --> 02:45:48.116]  Maryland and Missouri.
[02:45:48.136 --> 02:45:49.997]  Okay, I thought I had two states in a row.
[02:45:50.057 --> 02:45:50.798]  Maryland and Missouri.
[02:45:50.858 --> 02:45:51.718]  Maryland's a pretty name.
[02:45:52.079 --> 02:45:52.979]  Maryland, how are you doing?
[02:45:53.259 --> 02:45:54.700]  Well, thank you for the compliment.
[02:45:54.841 --> 02:45:55.181]  You bet.
[02:45:56.141 --> 02:46:00.404]  I've been engaged in the same kind of work you're doing for 30, 34 years.
[02:46:01.656 --> 02:46:04.838]  Five years I've served in public office.
[02:46:05.078 --> 02:46:13.304]  I have distributed videos to people that are elected and non-elected, mostly officials running our city.
[02:46:14.684 --> 02:46:19.948]  But there's one thing that I have a little problem with.
[02:46:20.788 --> 02:46:23.070]  And so my question to you is this.
[02:46:24.551 --> 02:46:30.955]  Have you really studied the fact that the people that are misnamed people
[02:46:31.391 --> 02:46:35.133]  American Indians are not all of the same blood.
[02:46:37.435 --> 02:46:39.696]  Well, I know there's a bunch of different tribes and groups of people.
[02:46:40.116 --> 02:46:52.063]  I was being sarcastic earlier because I've said on the air before that I've got some Native American blood, which I'm proud of, and I've gotten emails, you scumbag seed of Satan.
[02:46:52.463 --> 02:46:57.666]  Well, I don't know what your American Indian heritage is, but given the work you do,
[02:47:01.246 --> 02:47:03.827]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[02:47:04.828 --> 02:47:07.609]  And I would say that you have the good blood.
[02:47:07.629 --> 02:47:22.597]  So I'm hoping that one of these days, maybe you'll find time, if you have not done so already, to thoroughly study the 23rd chapter of the book of Deuteronomy.
[02:47:22.617 --> 02:47:24.538]  I'll try to read the 23rd.
[02:47:24.578 --> 02:47:25.038]  Let me see.
[02:47:25.058 --> 02:47:26.119]  The 23rd of Deuteronomy.
[02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:37.559]  Yes, and in the New Testament we have lots of references to I come not, but for the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[02:47:38.479 --> 02:47:44.884]  And I think all of us in the Patriot Movement need to develop an understanding.
[02:47:44.904 --> 02:47:48.487]  Yeah, I mean, certainly I don't understand all that stuff.
[02:47:48.527 --> 02:47:50.949]  I just, you know... Well, give it a try.
[02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:52.130]  Give it a try.
[02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:57.934]  And because I believe if we understood who we are
[02:47:58.621 --> 02:47:59.521]  And why we're here.
[02:48:00.341 --> 02:48:11.144]  That we could turn around this bastardly thing that's happening to our country and most of the world and begin to understand that we're here to be shepherds.
[02:48:12.584 --> 02:48:17.266]  We're not here to lord it over, be dictators, kill people, whoever they are.
[02:48:17.486 --> 02:48:19.246]  All right, Marilyn, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:19.266 --> 02:48:21.147]  I'm going to take one final call from Mike in Arizona.
[02:48:21.187 --> 02:48:22.667]  Sorry to others when we get back and hit a few.
[02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:25.762]  Some good news and some bad news, too.
[02:48:26.022 --> 02:48:27.243]  Different things have happened today.
[02:48:27.824 --> 02:48:28.865]  But we can all know this.
[02:48:28.885 --> 02:48:30.287]  We're in the fight for civilization.
[02:48:30.327 --> 02:48:31.709]  We're in the fight for liberty and freedom.
[02:48:32.009 --> 02:48:33.190]  For all the marbles.
[02:48:33.891 --> 02:48:34.752]  This is for everything.
[02:48:35.193 --> 02:48:35.913]  It's on the line.
[02:48:36.354 --> 02:48:38.677]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:48:38.697 --> 02:48:44.223]  This has been a fiery, informative broadcast this ninth day of November.
[02:48:46.804 --> 02:48:49.685]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.905 --> 02:48:51.505]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:48:56.847 --> 02:49:03.569]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.909 --> 02:49:05.911]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.091 --> 02:49:08.933]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.034 --> 02:49:13.698]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.898 --> 02:49:18.322]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.542 --> 02:49:25.768]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.028 --> 02:49:28.450]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:51:54.385 --> 02:51:56.466]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air, my friend.
[02:51:56.486 --> 02:51:57.726]  Go ahead.
[02:51:57.746 --> 02:51:58.226]  Hi, Alex.
[02:51:58.846 --> 02:51:59.066]  Yes.
[02:52:00.447 --> 02:52:08.949]  You were talking earlier to a man from... I can't remember the name of the church, but... At any rate, these pastors who...
[02:52:09.850 --> 02:52:12.834]  Who apply for 501c3 status.
[02:52:13.094 --> 02:52:15.837]  I know there's a bunch of socialists and leftists out there doing it.
[02:52:15.857 --> 02:52:20.803]  The point is, the government has no business regulating churches.
[02:52:20.863 --> 02:52:21.804]  It's in the First Amendment.
[02:52:22.285 --> 02:52:24.648]  Yeah, but they bring it on themselves.
[02:52:24.688 --> 02:52:28.052]  They bring this problem on themselves by applying for 501c3 status.
[02:52:29.401 --> 02:52:29.981]  Oh, I agree.
[02:52:30.021 --> 02:52:35.744]  We shouldn't apply for that, but the government claims then you don't have tax exemption unless you have that.
[02:52:36.164 --> 02:52:36.524]  No, no, no.
[02:52:38.145 --> 02:52:40.146]  The church falls naturally under Section 508.
[02:52:43.267 --> 02:52:51.091]  These churches want to see a letter or something in writing from the government, otherwise they feel insecure.
[02:52:51.993 --> 02:52:54.554]  I think it's mainly their attorneys that talk them into... I don't know.
[02:52:54.574 --> 02:52:55.875]  We've had Pastor Dixon on.
[02:52:55.895 --> 02:52:58.436]  We've done a whole... I've probably done 30 shows on this.
[02:52:58.556 --> 02:52:59.016]  I don't know.
[02:52:59.276 --> 02:53:01.297]  Yeah, well, Pastor Dixon screwed up.
[02:53:01.697 --> 02:53:04.458]  Yeah, he signed on to it and then pulled out of the contract.
[02:53:04.658 --> 02:53:05.719]  Right, exactly.
[02:53:06.019 --> 02:53:16.203]  And he pulled out, and he started not withholding before... Well, I tried to explain to the guy that they didn't need a 501c3 at the beginning, and he wanted to stay in that contract.
[02:53:17.068 --> 02:53:26.192]  Yeah, well, if you stay in that contract, you can certainly waive your right, and you will be a religious organization and not a church in their eyes.
[02:53:26.392 --> 02:53:31.775]  And as such, they can regulate you and tell you that you... But you know how these globalists do it.
[02:53:31.795 --> 02:53:34.116]  They've got everybody used to practicing this for so long.
[02:53:34.136 --> 02:53:38.238]  Now they're just trying to say, hey, no churches, period, unless you're certified by us.
[02:53:38.658 --> 02:53:38.898]  Sure.
[02:53:39.178 --> 02:53:45.221]  You know, once the precedent has been made and is left in place long enough, then they say, well, it's public policy.
[02:53:46.483 --> 02:53:46.943]  Exactly.
[02:53:46.963 --> 02:53:49.905]  I'm saying it's policy that you don't say you're against the war.
[02:53:50.265 --> 02:53:51.186]  Imagine the U.S.
[02:53:51.226 --> 02:53:54.488]  government going into churches saying you can't give a speech against the war.
[02:53:56.090 --> 02:53:56.250]  Yeah.
[02:53:56.570 --> 02:53:57.891]  I mean, is this America, folks?
[02:53:57.911 --> 02:53:59.292]  They're saying we don't own our property.
[02:53:59.312 --> 02:54:03.675]  They can put our kids on drugs if they say they're going to make us take vaccines.
[02:54:03.735 --> 02:54:04.936]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[02:54:05.677 --> 02:54:10.860]  But some congressman, some Republican congressman put in a bill to do away with this 501c3 bill.
[02:54:12.695 --> 02:54:15.497]  Yeah, that was a few months ago.
[02:54:15.517 --> 02:54:18.619]  Yeah, and people need to jump on that.
[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:20.201]  I told my producer I wanted him on.
[02:54:20.461 --> 02:54:22.182]  I can't remember who it was either.
[02:54:22.903 --> 02:54:23.944]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:54:24.404 --> 02:54:25.625]  I really appreciate it, Mike.
[02:54:25.645 --> 02:54:26.826]  You bring up fabulous points.
[02:54:26.866 --> 02:54:27.727]  Callers always do.
[02:54:29.028 --> 02:54:32.211]  We've got some other really big guests coming up this week here on the broadcast.
[02:54:34.312 --> 02:54:37.475]  You do not want to miss the broadcast coming up Thursday and Friday.
[02:54:37.495 --> 02:54:40.898]  Here in closing, the Free Trade Area of the Americas is in deep trouble.
[02:54:41.534 --> 02:54:44.556]  Take another few years for it to get back on track, as many as five.
[02:54:45.196 --> 02:54:47.097]  Way behind schedule, but we've got to keep fighting it.
[02:54:47.117 --> 02:54:53.240]  You can thank Hugo Chavez and people out there, listeners, that have been fighting it for helping derail it.
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:55.401]  Good job, so that's going on.
[02:54:55.941 --> 02:54:57.822]  We have the Congress passing a law.
[02:54:57.862 --> 02:55:00.564]  It's about to go to the Senate, but the law hasn't passed yet.
[02:55:00.584 --> 02:55:01.524]  It's passed out of the House.
[02:55:02.164 --> 02:55:05.386]  To federally keep money away from the states that land grab for private interest.
[02:55:07.225 --> 02:55:11.469]  And we also have just Schwarzenegger's initiatives going down in flames.
[02:55:12.770 --> 02:55:16.232]  A bunch of good stuff is happening all over.
[02:55:16.853 --> 02:55:19.195]  And there's so many positive things that I saw.
[02:55:19.215 --> 02:55:20.096]  Oh, the hate crimes law.
[02:55:22.117 --> 02:55:25.360]  We haven't been able to get the Republicans for the last seven years to say they're against it.
[02:55:26.644 --> 02:55:33.248]  They've just been voting it down by narrower and narrower, hair-thin, razor-thin margins.
[02:55:33.848 --> 02:55:34.428]  Well, guess what?
[02:55:34.528 --> 02:55:37.470]  Frist is saying, because of pressure, yes, we're not bringing it up this year.
[02:55:37.830 --> 02:55:39.231]  I'm not going to let Kennedy bring it up.
[02:55:39.791 --> 02:55:44.994]  And so this is really... We brought it to a head with these ADL bullies.
[02:55:45.854 --> 02:55:47.435]  And let them know we're not going to put up with it.
[02:55:47.695 --> 02:55:49.937]  And that goes for all the other bullies, too.
[02:55:49.957 --> 02:55:51.918]  We're going to stand up to all of you.
[02:55:52.258 --> 02:55:54.379]  All of you liars and New World Order trash...
[02:55:55.569 --> 02:55:56.410]  The fight's on!
[02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:57.010]  Let's do it!
[02:55:58.711 --> 02:55:59.811]  Everything is on the line.
[02:55:59.831 --> 02:56:01.132]  There's a lot of bad stuff happening, too.
[02:56:01.192 --> 02:56:03.754]  San Francisco banning handguns, period, even in your own house.
[02:56:05.194 --> 02:56:08.516]  Chinese Christians being arrested for passing out Bibles.
[02:56:09.497 --> 02:56:19.182]  A lot of really, really serious things that are happening, and a lot of it that you didn't hear about on the show today is on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowars.net.
[02:56:19.202 --> 02:56:20.183]  They're all excellent sites.
[02:56:20.583 --> 02:56:21.523]  Be sure and check them out.
[02:56:21.603 --> 02:56:24.285]  God bless you all, and get out there and take on the New World Order!
[02:56:25.916 --> 02:56:26.157]  Or call 877-300-7645
