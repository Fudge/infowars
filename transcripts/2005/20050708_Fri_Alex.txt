[00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.404]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:08.145]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:09.967]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:11.448]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:13.249]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.673]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:22.037]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:39.909]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.092]  It is the 8th day of July 2005.
[00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:44.715]  It is Friday.
[00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:49.139]  Yesterday was 7705, as you know well.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.846]  And there were the four different bombings that took place in central areas of London.
[00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.605]  And we're going to open the phones up early in this hour.
[00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:19.455]  In fact, in the next segment, four listeners that want to comment on all the different discrepancies and evidence of prior knowledge and government involvement, or if you think, of course, it was the Islamicist acting alone, you're welcome to push forward that flawed view as well.
[00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:25.278]  And I just have a massive stack of news and new developments here that I want to go over.
[00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.569]  I also want to play George Galloway.
[00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.661]  Headline, wary of stage terror attack as pretext for Iran invasion.
[00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:48.265]  I asked him that question a few weeks ago at the end of our interview, Member of Parliament, and I said, well, they want to go into Iran.
[00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:50.646]  He said, well, they probably don't have the political capital to do it.
[00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:52.487]  I said, what if there's another attack?
[00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:55.488]  And he said, that's exactly a staged government attack.
[00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:57.149]  I had to blame it on Iran.
[00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.930]  And he said, that's exactly what these rascals will do.
[00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.850]  We've got to worry about that.
[00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.591]  That is a big threat.
[00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:09.152]  So we'll be playing this clip coming up in the start of the next segment.
[00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:20.619]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.980]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:28.144]  We also have two guests coming up today, starting in the middle of the second hour, and another guest in the third hour.
[00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:32.667]  We'll tell you about those guests in the course that they all involve the situation in London.
[00:02:33.448 --> 00:02:36.310]  We'll be discussing that as well throughout the broadcast.
[00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.351]  Also, we cannot become distracted by this event.
[00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:48.173]  We will analyze it, we will cover it, but meanwhile there are discussions of Karl Rove indictment being imminent.
[00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:50.093]  I don't know if I really believe that.
[00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:57.295]  For the Plame situation, selling out the CIA spy chief over in Europe.
[00:02:58.135 --> 00:03:13.081]  Just to burn her ambassador husband, who exposed the fact that the Niger uranium documents were complete forgeries, one of a sea, an ocean, a constellation of lies and manufactured documents.
[00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:22.825]  We also have Alberto Gonzalez coming out yesterday and saying, well, I don't plan to be on the Supreme Court, but if Bush asks me, I will.
[00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:31.368]  Trying to, you know, dampen the outrage and the mobilized forces against him.
[00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:46.163]  So we've got that happening, and of course bigger than even both of those events is CAFTA that passed the Senate last week, is on the verge of passing the House, and could be signed by the President as early as next week.
[00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:56.007]  So we are facing CAFTA, one large stepping stone towards the Pan-American Union, the Union of American States.
[00:03:57.608 --> 00:04:01.871]  And the bombings are a nice diversion for $62 a barrel oil.
[00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.934]  A lot of analysts say it could hit $100 in the next four to five months per barrel.
[00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:15.439]  That will just devastate the economy and invigorate and expand inflationary pressures.
[00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.602]  We are also facing the moves for forced drugging and psychological testing.
[00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:23.364]  Cameras and microphones are going in everywhere.
[00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:26.726]  The government is openly announcing the end of posse commentatis.
[00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:33.211]  To put troops on the streets even before the convenient and tragic bombing in London.
[00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:34.191]  Bombings in London.
[00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:37.974]  There is so much, so it's your chance to talk about it.
[00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:54.155]  Worldwide, blasting out on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on the blowtorch, WWCR, and on the internet at InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:57.178]  We'll be right back, so keep it locked in!
[00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:05.219]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.079]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.100]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:16.882]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:21.483]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.683 --> 00:05:22.323]  The Constitution
[00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:23.123]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.075]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:59.042]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:04.960]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:14.130]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.115]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:26.323]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:38.517]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.977 --> 00:06:43.422]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:46.044]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:47.926]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:49.187]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.207 --> 00:06:50.669]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:51.690]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:03.476]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:07.576]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:07.897 --> 00:07:08.717]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:13.258]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.478 --> 00:07:17.679]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:22.920]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.901]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:32.423]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:35.423]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:36.624]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:47.647]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:57.969]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:08.511]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:12.092]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:20.291]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:22.633]  We're back live.
[00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:25.256]  It is Friday.
[00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:28.460]  Second segment, 8 minutes, 25 seconds in.
[00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:32.104]  Coming up in the next hour, we got Jack Blood.
[00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:38.591]  He's going to be joining us with his analysis, his take on the tragic events over in London yesterday.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:52.664]  And I'm about to get into the latest developments concerning the string of blasts that the British government is still 30 something hours after the tragedy trying to cover up.
[00:08:53.985 --> 00:08:58.846]  It's got to be 40 hours plus after the tragedy.
[00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.807]  A lot of different conflicting stories.
[00:09:02.265 --> 00:09:08.748]  Of course, it is admitted that Benjamin Netanyahu did get a warning before the first blast not to leave his hotel.
[00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:10.849]  They tried to then deny that.
[00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:18.512]  Now, they're even in their denials having to admit, okay, he did get a warning, but it wasn't specific.
[00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:21.894]  So, talk about in your face.
[00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:29.137]  And then for an hour and a half after the bombings, which were clearly bombings, blown-up bus and blown-up trains,
[00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:33.642]  Three different bombings in the train station and, of course, a bus being bombed.
[00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:44.104]  They were still saying it was electrical surges while they tried to prepare to control the story and get their unified propaganda front going.
[00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:54.347]  We know who has the motive in all of this, the military-industrial complex whose phony war on terror that is really a war for empire and resources, it was stalling
[00:09:55.985 --> 00:10:13.513]  And at the very same time, with the war on terror stalling, we have the British people refusing to take the national ID cards, and saying that they would riot over it, and if they say it, they mean it.
[00:10:13.693 --> 00:10:21.316]  Normally a very circumscript and docile crowd, compared to many other populations.
[00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:26.352]  But once you get them mad, you've got a serious problem on your hands.
[00:10:26.412 --> 00:10:47.357]  And here domestically, the Karl Rove situation coming out, the fight over the Supreme Court nomination, and major trial balloons for Alberto Gonzales to be put in that position, the Supreme Court rulings on grabbing private property, just a whole host of issues like CAFTA set to pass the House here in the next week.
[00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:57.493]  To bring us into the free trade area of the Americas and one of the final pieces of the puzzle to create the American Union and the destruction of our sovereignty.
[00:10:57.513 --> 00:10:58.454]  $62 a barrel oil.
[00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:27.362]  All of this stuff is happening, and it was creating kind of a perfect storm of resistance against the New World Order, and just a huge awakening and outrage against the corrupt forces that have hijacked Western governments, predominantly Airstrip One, as it was known in 1984, England, and the larger component of Oceania, the United States.
[00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:44.463]  So, I have been predicting, in fact, I have now been reminded of this, and we're getting the clip, and listeners have been calling and reminding me of this, and I've been getting emails reminding me of it, on radio and TV, about a month and a half ago.
[00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:51.831]  Don't ask me how I do this, I just see all the different indicators, all the different pieces, I don't make a lot of predictions.
[00:11:52.712 --> 00:12:02.660]  And I said on the TV show that I'm not issuing a total alert, but that I was 90 plus percent sure we would have a terror attack in the next two months, and that was a month and a half ago.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.464]  I also said on the radio show, you heard callers calling in yesterday mentioning that fact.
[00:12:07.504 --> 00:12:10.147]  We're trying to find that particular day I said that on radio.
[00:12:10.487 --> 00:12:18.914]  We know the day I said it on TV, and there would probably be some type of bombing of trains or buses in New York or London.
[00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:20.935]  And again,
[00:12:22.478 --> 00:12:30.023]  There's hundreds of different pieces of information that I integrate in with these warnings that I issue, and I don't issue a lot of them.
[00:12:30.563 --> 00:12:41.611]  You know, I said they'll probably use Bin Laden, who's CIA, to take the blame for an attack on the World Trade Center complex, July 25th, 2001, again, two months before the attacks.
[00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.453]  I didn't say they'd fly airplanes into the buildings.
[00:12:45.343 --> 00:12:46.544]  I knew that was part of the plan.
[00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:47.744]  We talked about that previously.
[00:12:47.764 --> 00:12:48.704]  It's been all over the news.
[00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:52.946]  But, again, I didn't issue it a year before.
[00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:54.907]  I didn't issue it two years before.
[00:12:54.967 --> 00:13:00.909]  I issued it directly two months before and said call the White House and tell them don't carry the attacks out.
[00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:03.870]  I wasn't that sure this time.
[00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:10.953]  I just knew that with Bush having, a month and a half ago, a 35% approval rating.
[00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:11.733]  Right now it's at 27%.
[00:13:15.103 --> 00:13:19.686]  By the way, when you watch the national news, they'll tell you it's at 40%, 35%.
[00:13:20.107 --> 00:13:27.392]  Those are specific questions about the war, or specific questions about how he's handling the economy.
[00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:33.176]  When you ask about his general presidency, I've seen major Gallup polls and others, 27%!
[00:13:34.077 --> 00:13:39.921]  Okay, so we're seeing numbers, depending on the poll, between 27 and 35, 36%.
[00:13:44.142 --> 00:13:45.803]  Regardless, he's in the low 30s.
[00:13:45.923 --> 00:13:50.024]  I like to take multiple polls and kind of average them together.
[00:13:50.044 --> 00:13:51.604]  It's something I do.
[00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.045]  It's something that the focus groups do.
[00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:56.526]  I learned how to do that from reading about focus groups a decade ago.
[00:13:57.206 --> 00:14:01.847]  And you seem to get better numbers by doing that because all polls are inherently flawed.
[00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:05.428]  And by averaging a large group of them together, we get low 30s.
[00:14:05.728 --> 00:14:11.890]  And believe me, folks, when Bill Clinton's approval rating hit 33%, we had the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:14:13.402 --> 00:14:16.524]  There is no ifs, ands, or buts, or debate about it.
[00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:18.925]  That was a government operation.
[00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:24.429]  We have it ironclad, documented, and we cover that in 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:14:25.109 --> 00:14:30.532]  44 minutes of the almost three-hour film is exclusively dedicated to Oklahoma City.
[00:14:32.193 --> 00:14:34.294]  And we spend about 40 minutes on 9-11.
[00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.536]  We spend about five minutes on the first World Trade Center attack.
[00:14:37.556 --> 00:14:41.759]  You know, there's so many government-sponsored terror events that where we've caught them red-handed,
[00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:46.342]  That it takes hours just to cover it properly.
[00:14:46.682 --> 00:14:50.383]  And again, we cannot think about all of this in a vacuum.
[00:14:51.463 --> 00:14:58.905]  Every time their agendas stall, that is the globalists that own our Prime Ministers and Presidents like loose change in their pockets.
[00:14:59.405 --> 00:15:05.207]  Every time their agendas stall, we have massive terror attacks.
[00:15:06.587 --> 00:15:06.887]  It is
[00:15:07.688 --> 00:15:08.969]  That simple.
[00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:09.970]  Every.
[00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:10.831]  Single.
[00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:11.572]  Time.
[00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:13.453]  Their program is in trouble.
[00:15:13.494 --> 00:15:14.034]  This happens.
[00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:22.122]  Vladimir Putin was wildly unpopular as Vice President under the drunken idiot Boris Yeltsin.
[00:15:23.803 --> 00:15:26.646]  He was not going to win in Russia.
[00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:37.722]  They did not have control of all the polling places so they could carry out a fraud election, and so he had three apartment buildings blown up and blamed it on the Chechens.
[00:15:38.322 --> 00:15:45.747]  FSB was caught planting the bombs, hexogen bombs, in the fourth building by Moscow police in the southern suburb.
[00:15:48.394 --> 00:15:54.019]  FSB, Federal Security Bureau forces went public and said it was an inside job.
[00:15:55.179 --> 00:16:01.424]  The other FSB agents raided the police station and seized the bombs and had their people released.
[00:16:02.605 --> 00:16:05.207]  We have caught the British doing it.
[00:16:05.567 --> 00:16:06.929]  We've got a giant archive.
[00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:16.456]  It's got to be like 50 different articles on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, the BBC, Reuters, UPI, London Telegraph, Scotsman.
[00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:29.069]  Ireland today reporting where admissions of the British, cooking bombs, training drivers, bombing buildings, literally then commanding IRA groups.
[00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:41.637]  Army Intelligence in Britain literally being the head of IRA splinter groups and then the low-level people below them are real terrorists and don't even know they're working for a British commando.
[00:16:43.366 --> 00:16:44.887]  And then it comes out it was all state.
[00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:47.910]  So, a lot of these bombings, you have real terrorists.
[00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:59.501]  But you will have CIA or MI6 or Mossad or KGB, which is FSB today, over them, funding them, training them.
[00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:04.906]  They'll go out and actually recruit extremists, give them the money, give them the expertise.
[00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:07.428]  So, you also have that.
[00:17:08.886 --> 00:17:12.428]  In fact, that is the majority of your conventional bombings are provocateur.
[00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:15.170]  Provocateur isn't the right word.
[00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.831]  It's even more than provocateur.
[00:17:17.992 --> 00:17:21.154]  It is literally orchestrated.
[00:17:21.334 --> 00:17:25.717]  And then you have cases like Operation Gladio, 120 plus bombings.
[00:17:25.737 --> 00:17:26.478]  It's up in the 130's.
[00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:27.318]  And those were just U.S.
[00:17:27.358 --> 00:17:27.438]  Army.
[00:17:32.737 --> 00:17:35.819]  Going out and blowing up school buses.
[00:17:35.879 --> 00:17:36.539]  It's their favorite.
[00:17:37.479 --> 00:17:38.540]  Predominantly in Italy.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.301]  Shooting politicians.
[00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:43.342]  And then blaming it on leftists who the government didn't like.
[00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:45.183]  Again, I'm not a leftist, folks.
[00:17:45.203 --> 00:17:46.124]  I'm not defending the leftists.
[00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:47.865]  The leftist groups did this kind of stuff, too.
[00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:51.186]  But it doesn't make it okay for our government to be out doing this.
[00:17:53.422 --> 00:17:55.263]  That's how they corrupted our government.
[00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:57.725]  That's how they corrupted Cold War warriors.
[00:17:58.205 --> 00:18:03.749]  They'd take troops who'd lost buddies in Korea, and they'd say, alright, Captain, you wanna really fight the commies?
[00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:09.733]  Well, here's examples of where the commies, you know, blew up their own stuff and blamed it on us.
[00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:11.474]  Well, we're gonna do the same thing to them.
[00:18:11.494 --> 00:18:13.215]  You know, this is how we win.
[00:18:13.255 --> 00:18:15.397]  We gotta be dirtier than anybody to win.
[00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:18.179]  You gotta be more evil than evil to protect good.
[00:18:18.199 --> 00:18:21.161]  You gotta protect the truth of the bodyguard of lies.
[00:18:21.621 --> 00:18:22.301]  Are you ready?
[00:18:22.361 --> 00:18:22.942]  Yes, sir!
[00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:25.243]  You blow that school bus up.
[00:18:25.263 --> 00:18:26.624]  This is how we'll beat the commies.
[00:18:26.825 --> 00:18:28.526]  Because the commies are killing millions.
[00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:34.550]  And why, if we just kill a few hundred little kids in a string of bombings, then we can save millions.
[00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.811]  So, do you understand?
[00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:37.312]  Yes, I understand.
[00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:39.814]  And then they come over to the dark side.
[00:18:40.534 --> 00:18:42.916]  And then from there, it's 9-11, folks!
[00:18:43.236 --> 00:18:45.258]  Planes flying into skyscrapers!
[00:18:47.302 --> 00:19:01.528]  And these guys get corrupt, they get a lot of extra money, they get the big mansions, they get the power, and the guys that were blowing up school buses in the 1970s are now in your State Department, they're now at the highest levels of the CIA, they're now at the highest levels of the Pentagon.
[00:19:01.748 --> 00:19:08.151]  Folks, let me just tell you, a lot of the people you see on TV, a lot of the administration individuals, they've actually killed.
[00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:08.831]  You understand?
[00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:09.832]  They've earned their bones.
[00:19:10.152 --> 00:19:11.192]  You've got to do that first.
[00:19:11.232 --> 00:19:11.973]  This is Mafia.
[00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:14.874]  These are hardcore killers.
[00:19:15.478 --> 00:19:17.259]  These are accomplished liars.
[00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:31.305]  These are very evil people who were selected and tested with dozens and dozens of tests for decades before they were put into real command positions.
[00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:39.729]  We'll play the George Galloway clip where he says it is a real threat for our government or his government to carry out attacks as a pretext to invade Iran or to bolster the war.
[00:19:39.749 --> 00:19:42.630]  Then we'll take your calls and get into a bunch of news.
[00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:44.493]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:44.513 --> 00:19:45.454]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:05.414]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.655 --> 00:20:06.736]  The real money folks.
[00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:11.948]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:13.409]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:14.890]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.350]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:18.733]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[00:20:18.753 --> 00:20:22.076]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:23.477]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:20:23.497 --> 00:20:24.598]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:40.549]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:21:11.576 --> 00:21:22.804]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:23.144 --> 00:21:28.848]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.

[00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:03.712]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.372 --> 00:22:13.941]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:22:14.995 --> 00:22:24.539]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:30.461]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[00:22:31.862 --> 00:22:39.585]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:02.438 --> 00:24:07.580]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.641]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:28.986]  Alright, again, I'm gonna go through an analysis after we take some calls on the latest developments with the tragic bombings in London.
[00:24:30.808 --> 00:24:33.369]  And we're hearing the probe into London Blast will be arduous.
[00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:35.210]  Ah yes, we're going to really get the truth.
[00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.491]  And the G8 leaders vowed victory against terrorism.
[00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.952]  Now their main focus is the war on terror.
[00:24:42.493 --> 00:24:43.013]  I.E.
[00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:48.656]  a total police state in your communities, in your cities, in your countries.
[00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:53.298]  All over the world, a pall of darkness is falling down upon us.
[00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:56.203]  Under the pretext of fighting terror.
[00:24:56.583 --> 00:25:02.805]  George Galloway, wary of staged terror attacks, has a pretext for Iran invasion.
[00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:13.028]  And I said, here's the transcript, what do we do if the military industrial complex carries out a terror attack to blame it on Iran, on them?
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.341]  Galloway.
[00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:16.242]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[00:25:16.643 --> 00:25:22.048]  There's no way we can legislate for that, but we need to be on guard.
[00:25:22.408 --> 00:25:23.529]  We need to be vigilant.
[00:25:23.749 --> 00:25:24.310]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.971]  Jones.
[00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:25.771]  Galloway.
[00:25:26.052 --> 00:25:31.957]  We need a vigilant citizenry that are wise for all the tricks of these monkeys are up to.
[00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:34.400]  And I tell you what, let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.821]  Member of the British Parliament.
[00:25:36.405 --> 00:25:45.610]  Just about less than a month ago, on this broadcast, saying he doesn't think they'll be able to go into Iran unless there is convenient terror attacks.
[00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.231]  And I said, well, they'll be behind it.
[00:25:47.651 --> 00:25:49.492]  And he said, that's a very real threat.
[00:25:49.792 --> 00:25:50.973]  So here's George Galloway.
[00:25:51.613 --> 00:25:53.314]  Just two more final questions.
[00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:53.935]  We're going to let you go.
[00:25:53.955 --> 00:25:56.476]  I know you're very busy, and it's evening over there in London right now.
[00:25:57.036 --> 00:26:01.959]  Mr. Galloway, George Galloway, looking at this, you've gotten to Iraq falling apart.
[00:26:03.235 --> 00:26:12.586]  The Pentagon's own P2OG documents, perhaps folks should send this to you, said they want to widen the hatred, cause more attacks as a pretext to invade more countries.
[00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:15.349]  Where do you see this ending and will they go into Iran?
[00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:18.010]  I think they're too weak to do so.
[00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.511]  I think the Iraqi resistance has stopped them in their tracks.
[00:26:22.111 --> 00:26:26.713]  Undoubtedly they planned to go into Iran and Syria for that matter.
[00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:32.115]  But I don't believe that the public opinion in your country or mine would follow them there.
[00:26:32.355 --> 00:26:35.096]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[00:26:35.116 --> 00:26:37.317]  They're saying they'll go ahead and may attack Iran.
[00:26:37.877 --> 00:26:45.600]  Well, there was an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.522]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one he'll have to count us out.
[00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:53.143]  What if Israel drags us in?
[00:26:53.383 --> 00:26:54.523]  Well, that's a possibility.
[00:26:54.963 --> 00:26:56.324]  Israel might strike Iran.
[00:26:56.984 --> 00:27:03.528]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[00:27:03.568 --> 00:27:05.930]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:06.870]  Well, I have another article.
[00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.772]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[00:27:09.832 --> 00:27:13.554]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[00:27:13.914 --> 00:27:17.757]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[00:27:17.857 --> 00:27:24.601]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:25.361]  Alright.
[00:27:25.641 --> 00:27:26.562]  We've got 30 seconds.
[00:27:26.602 --> 00:27:34.746]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack to blame it on them?
[00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.373]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[00:27:45.453 --> 00:27:51.357]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[00:27:51.457 --> 00:27:53.599]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[00:27:53.979 --> 00:27:54.640]  Unbelievable!
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.104]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[00:28:00.124 --> 00:28:01.385]  I salute you!
[00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:02.106]  Thank you very much.
[00:28:03.977 --> 00:28:07.039]  All right, folks, so that was the very end of the interview.
[00:28:07.079 --> 00:28:08.740]  We'll play that again in the third hour.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.901]  It's so important.
[00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:11.562]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:28:11.802 --> 00:28:12.322]  Jane?
[00:28:12.923 --> 00:28:14.544]  Jane, where are you calling us from today?
[00:28:14.824 --> 00:28:18.286]  This is up here in the security zone, Alex, the Baltimore, Washington area.
[00:28:18.446 --> 00:28:20.807]  Oh, up there in lockdown command base.
[00:28:20.827 --> 00:28:21.528]  You better believe it.
[00:28:21.548 --> 00:28:26.031]  And they're in a panic, too, because there appears to be a sea change taking place out here in the media.
[00:28:26.051 --> 00:28:32.054]  I'm witnessing a crossover and, in effect, the mainstreaming of Alex Jones, so to speak.
[00:28:32.094 --> 00:28:32.855]  I mean, I heard it brought
[00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:44.577]  Your name was dragged into C-SPAN only yesterday morning when they forced people in typical PSYOP fashion to begin having a touchy-feely on what they thought about the bombings in London.
[00:28:44.617 --> 00:28:54.963]  And immediately, someone called in and pointed out the intuitive, obvious intuitive possibility that this was an inside job because it was just a little too perfect.
[00:28:55.303 --> 00:29:02.087]  Now I saw the Arutz Sheva, Israeli newspaper report, Israeli national news report,
[00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:12.421]  Documenting the advance warning to Benjamin Netanyahu, leaving us with the empirical question, did he show up on time or not at that economic conference?
[00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:16.123]  No, they say he showed up late, but now they've tried to change that story.
[00:29:16.484 --> 00:29:24.430]  Well, it's really important that you guys mirror these sites and keep this stuff, because to me this is more than entertainment, you understand?
[00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.193]  This is a legal brief for indictments and arrests and trials.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.560]  Well, let's stay there.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.200]  Stay there, Jan.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.101]  I'll let you finish up your comments on the other side, then we'll go to everybody else.
[00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:37.242]  Call the free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:37.282 --> 00:29:41.202]  We'll take calls and get more into the latest developments concerning the bombings.
[00:29:41.723 --> 00:29:42.703]  Who has the motive?
[00:29:42.763 --> 00:29:44.003]  Who's done this in the past?
[00:29:44.643 --> 00:29:46.063]  And you come to one conclusion.
[00:29:46.524 --> 00:29:47.484]  State-sponsored.
[00:29:47.664 --> 00:29:48.844]  Western-sponsored.
[00:29:51.805 --> 00:29:52.785]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:54.825]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.725 --> 00:29:58.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:03.191]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:30:03.392 --> 00:30:05.392]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:30:05.612 --> 00:30:06.272]  Prepare yourself.
[00:30:06.472 --> 00:30:10.153]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:30:10.293 --> 00:30:16.055]  Call toll free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.

[00:30:31.503 --> 00:30:31.803]  U.S.
[00:30:31.823 --> 00:30:32.884]  gold and silver coins.
[00:30:32.964 --> 00:30:34.085]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:30:34.245 --> 00:30:35.006]  Which are collectible?
[00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:35.787]  Which are bullion?
[00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:38.869]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:30:38.889 --> 00:30:40.470]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:40.891]  Coins.

[00:31:01.364 --> 00:31:04.385]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.685 --> 00:31:09.607]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:14.230]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:23.436]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.636 --> 00:31:27.279]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:32.582]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.882 --> 00:31:39.567]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.087 --> 00:31:40.727]  What about you?
[00:31:41.388 --> 00:31:46.750]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:01.664 --> 00:32:04.465]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:32:04.565 --> 00:32:09.648]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:32:09.868 --> 00:32:16.030]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:21.953]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:32:22.213 --> 00:32:27.715]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:32:27.975 --> 00:32:31.837]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:32:32.137 --> 00:32:37.099]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:32:37.299 --> 00:32:37.459]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:32:37.479 --> 00:32:38.480]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[00:32:44.102 --> 00:32:48.303]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:32:48.503 --> 00:32:51.424]  Well, with the Garicus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[00:32:51.604 --> 00:32:56.506]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:32:56.726 --> 00:32:59.126]  A Garicus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be!
[00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:11.490]  Alright, Jane and Barry and David and Ken and everybody, your calls are coming up here in just a moment.
[00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:19.854]  I do want to mention that the GCN Radio Network really is the global leader in alternative news reporting as it happens.
[00:33:20.114 --> 00:33:24.137]  Just amazing talk show host on this network, not just myself.
[00:33:25.058 --> 00:33:33.546]  And the way to support the network if you're online is to go to GCNlive.com if you want more than just the 8-bit free streams.
[00:33:33.626 --> 00:33:39.431]  I mean the other big radio networks out there, they're much bigger than we are, don't even offer streams for free.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.324]  We do, but we have to pay for those.
[00:33:42.665 --> 00:33:48.135]  You want a 16-bit or a 32-bit, you can subscribe for those different bandwidths for higher quality.
[00:33:48.175 --> 00:33:51.961]  It's like $7.95 a month and an upgrade is $9.95 a month.
[00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:53.043]  There's different packages.
[00:33:53.912 --> 00:34:05.279]  And you can also subscribe for just the archives of all the shows that are uploaded within two to three hours, sometimes even within minutes, but always within two or three hours of the end of a broadcast.
[00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:10.642]  They are uploaded in high quality for you to listen to how you want, when you want.
[00:34:11.602 --> 00:34:13.363]  So be sure and go to GCNLive.com.
[00:34:15.473 --> 00:34:18.295]  And get a membership today because the satellites are not cheap.
[00:34:18.395 --> 00:34:23.177]  You know, we have to rent radio satellite feeds to feed our affiliates, AM and FM affiliates.
[00:34:23.477 --> 00:34:27.860]  We rent one of those from ABC News because they own the radio satellite.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.181]  It's either that or Clear Channel.
[00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:34.263]  We have to rent also a TV satellite so we can feed the alternative news outlets that are out there.
[00:34:34.844 --> 00:34:35.524]  Very expensive.
[00:34:35.544 --> 00:34:39.146]  I don't want to get into a big wine fest about this.
[00:34:39.206 --> 00:34:40.807]  It's just we can do so much more
[00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:52.106]  When you support us, and this is a great way to do it, by going to GCNLive.com, you can hear broadcasts like this, and so we can continue to grow and fight the globalists.
[00:34:53.566 --> 00:35:00.368]  So GCNLive.com, and there's a lot of other great features and information there at GCNLive.com.
[00:35:00.388 --> 00:35:02.509]  Be sure and check out their book and video store as well.
[00:35:02.529 --> 00:35:05.050]  You can also buy an entire month of any program.
[00:35:05.874 --> 00:35:07.115]  I don't know how many hours that is.
[00:35:07.195 --> 00:35:14.422]  Five days a week, three hours of my show on one CD that plays in most CD players, all computers, and in most DVD players.
[00:35:16.004 --> 00:35:18.206]  All of the show for an entire month for $19.95.
[00:35:18.987 --> 00:35:22.550]  You can buy them individually or sign up for a six month subscription.
[00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.634]  I think they even have yearly subscriptions now if you want that.
[00:35:26.674 --> 00:35:28.236]  And they mail them out at the end of each month.
[00:35:29.324 --> 00:35:31.265]  In a very timely fashion.
[00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:40.451]  I have a lot of friends and people I know that subscribe to it because, you know, they can't listen a lot of times when they're at work, but they can listen via one CD.
[00:35:40.991 --> 00:35:47.395]  I mean, how many hours is five times four?
[00:35:48.656 --> 00:35:56.901]  And, you know, you calculate that up at so many hours of five times four, three times.
[00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.142]  So, I mean, we're talking
[00:35:58.564 --> 00:36:02.126]  What is it, upwards of 60-something hours a month?
[00:36:02.707 --> 00:36:07.110]  And I don't get a red cent of that, folks, but it gets the word out, and it supports this network.
[00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.711]  GCNlive.com, so please take advantage of that.
[00:36:10.031 --> 00:36:19.638]  And then very briefly, because I'm going to your calls and all this news, my new film, Martial Law, is all about government-sponsored terrorism, and it really is the preeminent work on the subject.
[00:36:19.958 --> 00:36:27.943]  How the Globalists carried out 9-11, how they executed it, the history of it, we break it down with only the information that is documented.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.595]  It is extremely powerful!
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:46.152]  We also spend time on the police state, and on who the globalists are, their mindset, their ideology, the Bush-Hitler connections, the Schwarzenegger-Nazi connections tied in with the Bushes, the cult of death, the order of death, and that's really who's running things.
[00:36:46.192 --> 00:36:48.554]  They really are part of a secret society.
[00:36:49.055 --> 00:36:50.736]  And it's three hours long, folks.
[00:36:50.776 --> 00:36:54.039]  The toll-free number to get Martial Law, or any of my other films, is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:05.594]  888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:37:05.634 --> 00:37:07.936]  You can order via the safe, secure shopping cart.

[00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:25.128]  It's an incredible deal, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:26.969 --> 00:37:32.213]  By the way, that subscription service makes all my websites and my three webmasters, you know, all of that possible.
[00:37:33.014 --> 00:37:38.238]  So that's how you support us and get just great content, best deal out there, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:38.378 --> 00:37:44.884]  Okay, got to catch up because I didn't plug much yesterday and, you know, that's vital to our operation, so please support us.
[00:37:45.364 --> 00:37:49.007]  Jane in Baltimore, start over for those that just joined us, the Marietta and other callers.
[00:37:49.487 --> 00:37:51.709]  You are watching C-SPAN and
[00:37:53.587 --> 00:37:56.888]  Repeat what that caller said and then get into some of the other examples.
[00:37:56.928 --> 00:37:59.189]  You talked about this awakening happening.
[00:37:59.229 --> 00:37:59.589]  Go ahead.
[00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:15.473]  I, just empirically speaking, I think they've overreached themselves with these London bombings because the media that I surf and, you know, C-SPAN a lot, EOCON talk, local talk radio here in Baltimore because I know some of the personalities personally.
[00:38:15.513 --> 00:38:17.213]  I surf that and I call into that a lot.
[00:38:17.953 --> 00:38:19.954]  And left gatekeepers like Pacifica.
[00:38:20.683 --> 00:38:25.786]  And within the last 48 hours, it's amazing the way the tone of the discussion has changed.
[00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:44.195]  When I saw that Arutz Sheva article posted, linked to from your website, detailing the advance warning to Netanyahu that there would be a bombing occurring, I phoned in immediately to the local neocon.am affiliate,
[00:38:44.798 --> 00:38:54.502]  And I got online, already two people had already called in and raised the prospect that these bombings were false flag operations by one or another intelligence agency.
[00:38:55.063 --> 00:39:11.370]  So that notion, and the guy was apoplectic, you know, the individual, I won't name him, but you know, somebody I know here in Baltimore who's a talk show host, I don't know how well intentioned he is, whether he's naive, I think he probably senses that this is just too much already, these guys have overreached themselves.
[00:39:12.006 --> 00:39:15.810]  I discern that also on the Pacifica affiliate in D.C.
[00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:16.470]  this morning.
[00:39:17.511 --> 00:39:22.096]  They're having people calling, people saying, hey, this just looks a little too packed, this looks like an inside job.
[00:39:23.577 --> 00:39:26.360]  Rolling back 9-11 again, people fall back on that.
[00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:37.030]  On July 4th, I happen to be, you know, I'm surfing internet radio, and I tune into KPFA, and lo and behold, they're broadcasting a loose change audio.
[00:39:37.831 --> 00:39:43.954]  Uh, which is very, very striking, very compelling in its presentation, and then I started looking at the forum responses of people emailing me.
[00:39:43.974 --> 00:39:45.775]  That's another 9-11 documentary.
[00:39:45.995 --> 00:39:51.058]  Yeah, and there's so much out there, and I think it's breaking through, Alex, that's what I think is happening.
[00:39:51.538 --> 00:40:04.064]  I don't think, I think the defection of people like Morgan Reynolds and Paul Craig Roberts, who are, you know, they're like rock-ribbed, uh, you know, free-market conservative Republicans, was a devastating blow
[00:40:05.078 --> 00:40:08.641]  Uh, you know, to the neo-conspirators.
[00:40:08.661 --> 00:40:13.544]  What about the George Galloway coming out when I said, well, couldn't the government carry out attacks?
[00:40:13.564 --> 00:40:15.465]  And he goes, yes, that's the big threat.
[00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.727]  It's this meme, this concept.
[00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:20.494]  of a state-sponsored terrorism.
[00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:26.796]  It's so critical it could keep hammering away at that, because I think deep down inside there's an intuitive aspect.
[00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:39.781]  Well, it's like ten guys invented radio on the same week around the world, dozens of civilizations at the same time, invented the wheel within just a few years of each other, the archaeological record shows.
[00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:45.963]  Humans instinctively get a base of knowledge to a certain level and it's almost as if by osmosis
[00:40:46.823 --> 00:40:48.945]  People instinctively know what's going on.
[00:40:49.645 --> 00:41:00.531]  And no, I mean, listen, I've done 2,600 and something radio interviews in the last four years, you know, since right before 9-11 and after, and I've seen a total shift.
[00:41:00.571 --> 00:41:05.094]  I mean, I do these talk shows where the host is attacking me, Jane, and no one calls in to disagree with me.
[00:41:05.154 --> 00:41:07.535]  I mean, maybe I'm one caller out of 20 or 30.
[00:41:07.936 --> 00:41:11.518]  So there is a total shift happening right now.
[00:41:11.878 --> 00:41:13.719]  Alex, people like you and Jack Blood,
[00:41:14.312 --> 00:41:17.937]  And to be honest, I like the people over at RBM as well.
[00:41:17.997 --> 00:41:19.459]  You know, John Statler and those guys.
[00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.661]  People of your stature.
[00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:25.046]  You should be available to the public on the publicly owned media.
[00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:26.008]  The networks.
[00:41:26.576 --> 00:41:28.476]  You have that kind of world-class stature.
[00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:31.457]  And what I'm looking for, we should be reaching out.
[00:41:31.477 --> 00:41:34.858]  You know, it was great that you had the British guys on there yesterday.
[00:41:34.878 --> 00:41:41.479]  And all the calls from Britain were so heartening that our cousins, our Anglo cousins over there, are with us in this fight against the New World Order.
[00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:46.000]  By the way, I've got like a hundred emails here from England alone.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.860]  We posted some of them.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.541]  I want to try to read some later.
[00:41:49.881 --> 00:41:52.161]  But real fast, I want to go to the other callers and get the news.
[00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:54.422]  Finish up the story on C-SPAN.
[00:41:55.002 --> 00:41:56.162]  Well, a guy called in.
[00:41:56.972 --> 00:42:04.014]  And said, you know, started itemizing, you know, the evidence and pointed to an inside job and the timing of it.
[00:42:04.034 --> 00:42:07.195]  And of course, the main question, Cui Bono, who benefits?
[00:42:07.955 --> 00:42:15.558]  And, you know, Steve, I'm sorry, I can't remember the name of the moderator on C-SPAN, but, you know, he's real mellow about it and all.
[00:42:15.578 --> 00:42:16.838]  Was it Brian Lamb?
[00:42:17.078 --> 00:42:18.098]  No, it wasn't Brian Lamb.
[00:42:18.138 --> 00:42:20.199]  Steve, I can't think of his name.
[00:42:20.219 --> 00:42:20.819]  The dark-haired guy?
[00:42:21.079 --> 00:42:21.760]  Yeah, right.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.060]  He's on there just about every morning.
[00:42:23.689 --> 00:42:26.790]  He says, uh, where do you get your information from?
[00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:38.493]  And the guy didn't hesitate a minute, he said, well folks, there's lots of great places, but if you want, but for a start, InfoWars, Prison Planet, Alex Jones, you're a meme in mainstream, you know what a meme is, Alex, right, if you know semiotics?
[00:42:38.573 --> 00:42:40.413]  Yeah, it's a major, a major thread.
[00:42:40.653 --> 00:42:44.574]  Well, like, like an icon, or a simple idea, like, inside job is a meme.
[00:42:44.614 --> 00:42:50.376]  You say that to people, and they don't need to read four volumes of Gibbons, The Client of Fall, The Roman Empire.
[00:42:50.436 --> 00:42:51.876]  No, I mean, I mean, it's a buzzword.
[00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:52.316]  Right.
[00:42:52.376 --> 00:42:53.218]  False flag.
[00:42:53.258 --> 00:42:55.000]  We've got to spread these concepts.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.887]  We have to educate the American public that they will be fit to rebuild a republic.
[00:43:00.127 --> 00:43:01.549]  That's really what this is about, isn't it?
[00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.412]  I mean, I hope it's what it's about.
[00:43:03.692 --> 00:43:06.296]  I will never be satisfied unless these guys are brought to trial.
[00:43:07.023 --> 00:43:07.544]  I hear you.
[00:43:07.604 --> 00:43:08.444]  Never stop, Jane.
[00:43:08.464 --> 00:43:08.825]  Thank you.
[00:43:09.265 --> 00:43:14.950]  And look, folks, by facing the horror, by facing the truth, we will stop them from carrying out other attacks.
[00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:33.705]  I mean, if people wake up that this is an inside job, you know, the media can keep denying it is, but if everybody on the ground knows the truth in a CNN poll, 90% believe it's government, you know, 50% in a major New York poll in Zogby, and that was, you know, eight, nine months ago, it's getting worse for them.
[00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:38.082]  If people on the ground know the truth, they will stop doing this, folks.
[00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:39.543]  I hope you understand that.
[00:43:41.063 --> 00:43:44.424]  So, that's why we spend so much time on this subject.
[00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:55.328]  And it's at times like these, with these horrible bombings, that are horrible for the people that died or were injured, for their families, it becomes evident how important this is.
[00:43:55.728 --> 00:43:57.749]  Barry in Louisiana, thanks for holding Barry.
[00:43:58.314 --> 00:43:59.755]  Yeah, Alex, it's two things.
[00:44:00.135 --> 00:44:09.138]  One, if you had the whereforeall to go blow up bombs in the middle of London, England, you would immediately announce who you are and why you did it for maximum terroristic effect.
[00:44:09.578 --> 00:44:11.239]  Two, the timeline is wrong.
[00:44:11.993 --> 00:44:18.537]  Tony Blair waited for Katie Couric, prime time audience in the United States, to come out and console his people.
[00:44:18.557 --> 00:44:21.479]  She went, oh wait a minute, special report, here comes Tony Blair to tell the world.
[00:44:21.879 --> 00:44:25.801]  Yeah, that's why they waited, that's why they waited like, you know, four or five hours.
[00:44:26.662 --> 00:44:29.223]  And then they, exactly, and it's totally staged.
[00:44:30.063 --> 00:44:33.445]  Yeah, they did it for our consumption, and it was obvious.
[00:44:33.525 --> 00:44:33.906]  Thank you.
[00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:35.406]  Thank you for the call.
[00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:36.647]  David in Louisiana.
[00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:37.468]  David, go ahead.
[00:44:38.488 --> 00:44:39.109]  Yeah, Alex?
[00:44:39.509 --> 00:44:39.789]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:40.743 --> 00:44:53.682]  Uh, last night I was watching CNN, one of them channels, headline news or something, there was a girl, there was a woman on there, Nancy Grace, and that's all she was talking about was, we need a police state, we need to enforce these police laws, the Patriot Act, and everything like that.
[00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.519]  I mean, I've never seen her on TV before.
[00:44:55.539 --> 00:44:57.420]  Well, yeah, their response is so obvious.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.181]  We've got to give up our rights.
[00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:00.442]  That's how we fight the enemy.
[00:45:00.962 --> 00:45:01.843]  We've got to do this.
[00:45:01.943 --> 00:45:04.504]  And, oh, look, some message board said it was Al Qaeda.
[00:45:04.845 --> 00:45:05.645]  So it must be.
[00:45:05.705 --> 00:45:06.826]  Boy, here's our proof.
[00:45:07.186 --> 00:45:09.107]  Yeah, I was washing clothes at about 3 o'clock in the morning.
[00:45:09.147 --> 00:45:10.188]  I was watching that on TV.
[00:45:10.228 --> 00:45:11.749]  I couldn't believe that freaking woman.
[00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:14.350]  I mean, she was just barreling it out.
[00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.652]  She was interviewing two or three other people.
[00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:18.408]  I would agree.
[00:45:18.448 --> 00:45:25.512]  Nancy Grace is just a horrible police state intellectual prostitute.
[00:45:25.792 --> 00:45:30.555]  Yeah, from the way I saw it, she's worse than Ann Coulter.
[00:45:31.555 --> 00:45:33.396]  She's trying to get that mantle, yes.
[00:45:33.536 --> 00:45:34.917]  Alex, I'm doing something for you.
[00:45:34.977 --> 00:45:41.041]  I'm promoting your website and GCN website on my car and advertising on my car everywhere I drive.
[00:45:41.741 --> 00:45:42.542]  Well, I appreciate that.
[00:45:42.562 --> 00:45:43.862]  What have you got, a big poster?
[00:45:43.882 --> 00:45:45.243]  I'm getting letters from Walmart.
[00:45:45.683 --> 00:45:46.224]  Sorry about that.
[00:45:46.983 --> 00:45:50.645]  I'm getting a bunch of letters and putting a bunch of phrases of yours on my car.
[00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:52.486]  That's the best I can do for you, man.
[00:45:53.386 --> 00:45:53.987]  God bless you.
[00:45:54.007 --> 00:45:55.067]  Just plug the website.
[00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:55.948]  Say, learn the truth.
[00:45:56.108 --> 00:45:56.788]  That's what I'm doing.
[00:45:56.828 --> 00:45:57.429]  Hey, I got on there.
[00:45:57.649 --> 00:45:58.889]  GCNlive.com.
[00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.151]  Real news that you can use so you can never be abused.
[00:46:02.712 --> 00:46:03.532]  Hey, I like it.
[00:46:04.593 --> 00:46:06.454]  Well, I gotta go, Alex.
[00:46:06.794 --> 00:46:08.675]  I'm listening to you at work best I can.
[00:46:08.695 --> 00:46:10.136]  Trying to educate everybody at work.
[00:46:10.236 --> 00:46:11.236]  Well, God bless you, David.
[00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:12.817]  Take care, my friend.
[00:46:12.877 --> 00:46:13.858]  Ken in California.
[00:46:13.878 --> 00:46:14.558]  Ken, go ahead.
[00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:20.711]  Yes, I believe there is enough evidence right now to indict Bush and Rumsfeld for ordering torture.
[00:46:21.031 --> 00:46:25.215]  Believe it or not, I don't think we're going to get them out of office on taking us to war illegitimately.
[00:46:25.375 --> 00:46:27.717]  It's like Al Capone using the income tax.
[00:46:27.777 --> 00:46:28.217]  Exactly.
[00:46:28.998 --> 00:46:32.461]  There's plenty of evidence on this torture gate as far as I'm concerned.
[00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:35.564]  They're doing it all over the world, as you know, in all kinds of secret locations.
[00:46:35.864 --> 00:46:39.247]  I think this is the best way to get them out.
[00:46:39.287 --> 00:46:39.908]  I was talking to a
[00:46:40.288 --> 00:46:49.275]  To one of the neocons right here in Los Angeles, one of the talk show hosts, I won't mention his name, but he was actually running scared because every Thursday he had what he called Disagreement Day.
[00:46:49.295 --> 00:46:51.497]  We'd call him, we'd disagree with him, and whatever.
[00:46:51.717 --> 00:47:00.004]  And I mean, I'm not kidding, 90% of the people calling in were just blasting Bush over all the illegal things that he was doing.
[00:47:00.044 --> 00:47:00.685]  He was shocked.
[00:47:00.745 --> 00:47:02.106]  He was in absolute shock.
[00:47:02.406 --> 00:47:06.970]  And he started calling people names, you idiot, and one of my friends he called an idiot who had called up and da-da-da.
[00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.672]  But the fact of the matter is, I think they're running scared now.
[00:47:10.743 --> 00:47:17.662]  Sir, I mean, one example is I was on Kogo Radio like two and a half years ago talking about 9-11 being an inside job for like two hours.
[00:47:18.576 --> 00:47:26.202]  And, literally, it was like 20 to 1, the callers were calling in agreeing, as the host was attacking me, and he said, that's it!
[00:47:26.762 --> 00:47:37.150]  That's it, you're all crazy, it's a full moon, he hung up on me, I went and listened on the web, and he was going, you're all just crazy, you've all gone crazy, it's a full moon, why are you agreeing with this nut?
[00:47:37.531 --> 00:47:41.053]  You see, it doesn't matter, they can all split, look, look, here's the example.
[00:47:42.755 --> 00:47:45.477]  92% of Americans in major polls believe the U.S.
[00:47:45.497 --> 00:47:46.518]  government killed Kennedy.
[00:47:46.878 --> 00:47:48.199]  Now those were polls a couple years ago.
[00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:50.370]  Okay, it's getting worse for them.
[00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:55.671]  So 8% can sit up there on TV and say we're all crazy, but we know the truth!
[00:47:55.711 --> 00:47:56.532]  It doesn't matter!
[00:47:57.592 --> 00:47:58.412]  You understand that?
[00:47:58.732 --> 00:47:58.912]  Right.
[00:47:59.092 --> 00:48:01.133]  I mean, so you're experiencing what I've seen.
[00:48:01.873 --> 00:48:11.557]  And then there are, there's a big group of people that are weak-minded and think that TV is what the main view is, and the TV is the truth, and then the front page of the paper is the truth, and so they'll stay in that paradigm.
[00:48:11.897 --> 00:48:12.817]  But we've got to listen.
[00:48:12.977 --> 00:48:16.298]  The only thing they've got over us now is we still feel like we're alone.
[00:48:16.898 --> 00:48:18.299]  We're actually the majority, but
[00:48:19.002 --> 00:48:21.163]  We're actually winning, but we don't know we're winning.
[00:48:21.463 --> 00:48:30.607]  We're listening to Tokyo Rose propaganda, saying we're going to lose this fight, when we're actually taking over their positions, we're actually taking over their media, we're actually having victories everywhere.
[00:48:30.627 --> 00:48:32.428]  And I tell you, now is the danger time.
[00:48:32.788 --> 00:48:34.989]  You think these bombings of these buses is a big deal?
[00:48:35.249 --> 00:48:42.593]  We could wake up any morning with smallpox, we could wake up any morning with nukes going off, and it's a catch-22.
[00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:45.454]  If we put up with the globalists, they were going to do this, even sooner.
[00:48:45.991 --> 00:48:47.032]  Okay, because this is our plan.
[00:48:47.352 --> 00:48:48.793]  Total martial law forever.
[00:48:49.233 --> 00:48:49.613]  I agree.
[00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:58.519]  But it's a Catch-22, so we have to expose them, but at the point we expose them, and they're imploding, they will carry out these attacks probably regardless.
[00:48:59.079 --> 00:49:04.402]  But at least people will be awake, and their system of martial law won't be able to be fully installed.
[00:49:05.063 --> 00:49:06.564]  I hope you're right.
[00:49:06.764 --> 00:49:09.486]  Listen, it's not a pretty prospect, but you know what?
[00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:14.809]  If somebody's going to attack us, and if the globalists are going to come up and punch us, we might as well stand up.
[00:49:15.362 --> 00:49:29.166]  You know, I mean, they are abusive, they are vicious, they are offensive, they are offensively attacking us, so all we can do is tell the truth and, you know, let the chips fall where they may and know that God's on our side.
[00:49:29.186 --> 00:49:30.047]  I agree.
[00:49:30.947 --> 00:49:31.587]  Anything else, Ken?
[00:49:31.607 --> 00:49:32.127]  That's it.
[00:49:33.188 --> 00:49:34.108]  I appreciate your call.
[00:49:34.328 --> 00:49:36.049]  I mean, the phones are wide open right now.
[00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:43.691]  I mean, I'm sure they're loaded up, but my point is that you can call in and, you know, you disagree with me on what happened in England.
[00:49:44.554 --> 00:49:45.354]  You're welcome to do it.
[00:49:46.774 --> 00:49:47.555]  I mean, you can do it.
[00:49:49.015 --> 00:49:50.815]  We don't censor and listen to all the callers.
[00:49:50.835 --> 00:49:51.415]  They're agreeing.
[00:49:52.496 --> 00:49:53.756]  Bob in Idaho, you're on the air.
[00:49:53.796 --> 00:49:54.456]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:49:54.736 --> 00:49:55.376]  Morning, Alex.
[00:49:55.536 --> 00:49:55.916]  Hello.
[00:49:56.417 --> 00:50:01.177]  I'd like to comment on something I heard early yesterday morning before the media clamped down in London.
[00:50:01.638 --> 00:50:01.878]  Yes.
[00:50:02.638 --> 00:50:12.920]  I was on a road trip and I was coming home and I was listening to a station out of Lewis in Idaho and a news blurb came over the radio and the lady was, actually it was ABC News,
[00:50:13.456 --> 00:50:21.964]  And she reported that there were multiple explosions in the subway in London that had gone off simultaneously and there were thousands of casualties.
[00:50:22.825 --> 00:50:24.727]  And that basically was the gist of it.
[00:50:24.747 --> 00:50:26.148]  And I got home about an hour later.
[00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:31.092]  I called my girlfriend, who's now in Phoenix right now, and I told her to turn on the television and tell me what she saw.
[00:50:31.212 --> 00:50:36.435]  Well, that's the reports they were getting because multiple cops, bobbies, were reporting.
[00:50:36.495 --> 00:50:38.055]  I'm looking at 50 people down.
[00:50:38.576 --> 00:50:40.397]  So each of those are counted as reports.
[00:50:41.277 --> 00:50:45.539]  The numbers went up to, like, 40 dead and 800-something wounded.
[00:50:45.559 --> 00:50:47.840]  So a casualty doesn't mean dead.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.381]  You can also mean injured.
[00:50:51.122 --> 00:50:53.283]  That was over-reporting of the explosions.
[00:50:54.363 --> 00:50:55.624]  Stay there and we'll
[00:50:56.403 --> 00:50:58.964]  We'll, uh, talk about it more, Ken, er, er, Barbashan.
[00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:08.466]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.787 --> 00:51:10.147]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:12.588]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.728 --> 00:51:14.808]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.088 --> 00:51:20.010]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:24.391]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.631 --> 00:51:26.412]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.492 --> 00:51:37.136]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.296 --> 00:51:39.177]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.377 --> 00:51:43.258]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.
[00:51:43.358 --> 00:51:44.619]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:04.583]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.603 --> 00:52:13.753]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.093 --> 00:52:18.779]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:25.947]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.347 --> 00:52:38.100]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.064]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:34.891]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:35.612]  I think so.
[00:54:15.498 --> 00:54:17.059]  The globalists are ruthless.
[00:54:17.139 --> 00:54:17.859]  They are cunning.
[00:54:17.899 --> 00:54:23.401]  They see themselves as basically owners of a bunch of farm animals.
[00:54:24.842 --> 00:54:28.764]  And that we're to be corralled and controlled and polled.
[00:54:28.784 --> 00:54:31.645]  And we have to stop being weak minded.
[00:54:31.665 --> 00:54:32.725]  We have to stop being naive.
[00:54:32.745 --> 00:54:33.766]  We have to learn history.
[00:54:34.546 --> 00:54:39.228]  We have to learn what Machiavelli taught us when he wrote The Prince 500 plus years ago.
[00:54:40.689 --> 00:54:47.891]  And we have to look at the facts, and look at who stands to gain, and look at all the actual physical evidence of who's behind the attacks.
[00:54:47.931 --> 00:54:49.872]  And then it becomes sterling clear.
[00:54:50.812 --> 00:54:58.694]  What we do know is not a false report, as they tried to claim, was the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu was warned by the British government not to go to one of these meetings.
[00:55:00.195 --> 00:55:01.775]  Because it was a major threat of an attack.
[00:55:01.795 --> 00:55:02.975]  That's even before the attack.
[00:55:03.656 --> 00:55:08.517]  And we know that other warnings went out to other officials and dignitaries who were in the area.
[00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:18.439]  Right after it, while they were telling the public that it was just some power surges, while they got their story straight and tried to control the situation.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:27.446]  Then at the very same time, we have reports that came out, of course, that there were upwards of 8-10 bombings.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:38.225]  That's because in a tunnel, folks, if a bomb goes off, it sends a shockwave and, you know, smoke and fire down, you know, in some cases, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of yards.
[00:55:38.745 --> 00:55:46.250]  And so you have different groups of police and different railroad workers, different tube workers, underground workers, reporting explosions.
[00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:52.714]  And then you have groups of police coming in from different areas of the tunnels and seeing the injured and reporting those numbers back.
[00:55:52.754 --> 00:55:55.916]  And so you've got a lot of duplication of numbers, but it's around 40 dead,
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:03.884]  And what is it, 800 injured now are the numbers we're getting coming up on two days after the event.
[00:56:04.865 --> 00:56:08.487]  Let's go back to Bob in Idaho.
[00:56:08.807 --> 00:56:09.587]  Bob, anything else?
[00:56:09.607 --> 00:56:12.369]  Yeah, just one more comment, Alex.
[00:56:12.409 --> 00:56:19.713]  I just found it fascinating how the major media here in the States was trying really hard to minimize what had happened over there.
[00:56:21.374 --> 00:56:23.836]  And I think it's going to be fascinating again
[00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:26.931]  When the truth comes out, because I think the Mossad did this.
[00:56:29.373 --> 00:56:30.754]  You think the Mossad did it?
[00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:31.355]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:32.456 --> 00:56:33.857]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:56:33.937 --> 00:56:46.927]  I mean, all I know is that it has been admitted in Israeli newspapers that Mossad will grab 15, 18-year-old Palestinian men, torture them for years, then train them, fund them, get them under their control.
[00:56:46.967 --> 00:56:49.009]  In other cases, just recruit people that will work for them.
[00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:56.380]  And to carry out bombings in Israel and surrounding areas, but then blame it on the Palestinians as a pretext to crack down.
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.462]  Now that's Haratz, UPI, Jerusalem Post.
[00:56:59.782 --> 00:57:01.183]  That is admitted public.
[00:57:01.223 --> 00:57:01.903]  That's not debatable.
[00:57:03.064 --> 00:57:04.384]  But then we have Putin doing it.
[00:57:04.465 --> 00:57:05.405]  We have Bush doing it.
[00:57:05.445 --> 00:57:06.426]  We have Clinton doing it.
[00:57:06.466 --> 00:57:07.626]  We have the British doing it.
[00:57:08.627 --> 00:57:10.728]  We have so many governments doing this.
[00:57:10.748 --> 00:57:14.130]  I mean, this is a favorite tactic going back thousands of years.
[00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:15.250]  You know, burn your own building.
[00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:16.531]  Blame it on the enemies.
[00:57:16.591 --> 00:57:17.431]  Bomb your own building.
[00:57:17.611 --> 00:57:18.532]  Blow up your own ship.
[00:57:19.987 --> 00:57:23.088]  So, we don't know right now who specifically carried it out.
[00:57:24.708 --> 00:57:36.791]  And you've got to remember that these intelligence agencies, the Mossad, ShinBad, MI6, British Intelligence, MI5, CIA, Defense Intelligence, they're all interconnected, interlocking.
[00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:44.993]  So, I can't say the Israelis did this, but it does stink to high heaven that they warned Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:57:46.202 --> 00:57:47.584]  Uh, let's go ahead.
[00:57:47.644 --> 00:57:49.105]  We just know the government stands to gain.
[00:57:49.546 --> 00:57:50.767]  The centralized powers.
[00:57:51.428 --> 00:57:53.890]  Let's talk to Rose in South Carolina.
[00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:57.053]  We'll probably have to hold her over to the next hour, but go ahead and get started, Rose.
[00:57:57.314 --> 00:58:01.278]  I don't have too much to say, Alex, but maybe I can get it in.
[00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:04.601]  Did not someone say Giuliani was over there?
[00:58:04.962 --> 00:58:08.585]  Did not he go into some kind of security business after he left his
[00:58:09.526 --> 00:58:19.231]  Yeah, he's made, uh, himself, uh, just tens of millions of dollars fighting terror, and he was, he was literally, in his own words, yards away from one of the explosions.
[00:58:19.471 --> 00:58:21.292]  I find that very interesting.
[00:58:22.812 --> 00:58:24.173]  Stinks to high heaven, doesn't it?
[00:58:24.253 --> 00:58:25.154]  Yeah, it does.
[00:58:25.714 --> 00:58:27.034]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[00:58:27.054 --> 00:58:27.955]  Uh, Rose, anything else?
[00:58:28.375 --> 00:58:32.777]  No, no, I just, I just find things just moving very fast, it looks like.
[00:58:33.838 --> 00:58:34.398]  They are.
[00:58:34.998 --> 00:58:35.959]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:35.999 --> 00:58:38.620]  We've got to remain very vigilant and get the truth out.
[00:58:41.542 --> 00:58:45.445]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.765 --> 00:58:46.566]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.626 --> 00:58:46.946]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.721]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.441 --> 00:59:02.542]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.182 --> 00:59:04.043]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.763 --> 00:59:05.664]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.684 --> 00:59:10.006]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.527 --> 00:59:14.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.472 --> 00:59:24.175]  Well, the New World Order crowd is capitalizing on the tragic events.
[00:59:26.048 --> 00:59:29.970]  In London yesterday, G8 leaders vowed victory against terrorism.
[00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:35.733]  I got a bunch of emails from in and around England and Europe that I want to go over.
[00:59:35.873 --> 00:59:37.214]  I mean, literally hundreds of them.
[00:59:37.954 --> 00:59:41.736]  We posted quite a few of them on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:59:42.276 --> 00:59:45.137]  We got Jack Blood joining us for about 30 minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[00:59:45.238 --> 00:59:52.141]  And then an expert on African terrorism who lived in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia.
[00:59:53.901 --> 01:00:03.628]  We'll be coming on as well for an hour and tying into how they use the threat of terrorism to set up a police state there and merge that with the debate and the situation in London.
[01:00:03.988 --> 01:00:08.411]  All those developments are coming up, but let's continue with your phone calls right now.
[01:00:09.532 --> 01:00:13.915]  Let's go to Charles in Louisiana, then Thomas, David, Rodney, Ron, and others.
[01:00:13.935 --> 01:00:14.675]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:15.296]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:19.979]  Mr. Jones, when you asked this program, you said that England's on the verge of revolution.
[01:00:20.942 --> 01:00:23.983]  So, the people in England, I don't know what they're doing.
[01:00:24.023 --> 01:00:25.084]  I listen to Paul Watts.
[01:00:25.444 --> 01:00:27.464]  But what is the poll saying up there?
[01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.385]  They believe the government's behind it or not?
[01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:31.386]  Well, they haven't had those polls.
[01:00:31.506 --> 01:00:38.909]  I mean, you know, it took us years of exposing government prior knowledge and involvement, 9-11, to have national polls of, do you think this ridiculous thing is true?
[01:00:38.949 --> 01:00:40.669]  And then the majority go, yes we do!
[01:00:40.749 --> 01:00:44.651]  And CNN freaks out and pulls their hair out on that stupid Anderson Cooper show.
[01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:49.914]  But every caller we have from England thought it was an inside job.
[01:00:50.234 --> 01:00:52.896]  Every email we've gotten from England thinks it's an inside job.
[01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:56.599]  But obviously we've got an audience that's predominantly already of this view.
[01:00:56.619 --> 01:01:10.388]  I asked them specifically, caller after caller, from England and Scotland and Ireland yesterday, and they all said that half the people they're talking to think it's an inside job, and the other half think the government's going to use it for bad things.
[01:01:10.428 --> 01:01:14.971]  But yeah, they're trying to pass national ID cards over there, and the Brits aren't going to put up with it.
[01:01:15.392 --> 01:01:19.780]  Well, I'm just going to say, they're going to use this to bring Blair's rating up.
[01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:22.946]  Now you watch and see, even if they're going to lie about it.
[01:01:23.588 --> 01:01:24.089]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:33.787]  They're going to use this... Well, in the past, terrorism really made the people rally around the leader, and it did help them, but more and more it's not working for the globalists.
[01:01:34.227 --> 01:01:37.748]  Believe me, London is a beta test for something that will dwarf 9-11.
[01:01:38.848 --> 01:01:43.370]  That's why we've got to get out there now and expose it so it blows up in their face, pun intended.
[01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.950]  Well, me and my wife and a friend went to a little sandwich shop last night.
[01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:47.571]  We was tired.
[01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:49.271]  My wife was so tired she didn't want to cook.
[01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:51.011]  And everybody was talking about it.
[01:01:51.332 --> 01:01:54.512]  And Mr. Jones, so help me, there must have been 20 people there.
[01:01:54.773 --> 01:01:57.273]  And they all agreed, they said, this is another government op.
[01:01:58.013 --> 01:02:00.654]  And went to a little sandwich shop right down here in Walker.
[01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:04.135]  I was so proud, you know, I was so proud to be around these people.
[01:02:04.495 --> 01:02:06.636]  People are not stupid anymore.
[01:02:06.676 --> 01:02:07.296]  Praise God!
[01:02:07.316 --> 01:02:09.017]  And 20 people, I mean, everybody agreed.
[01:02:09.257 --> 01:02:10.457]  And I stood up and said, y'all agree?
[01:02:10.677 --> 01:02:12.298]  They said, yes, yes, we agree with this.
[01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:13.958]  We all agree with it.
[01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:16.379]  I'm telling you, people are waking up, Mr. Jones.
[01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:16.739]  Yes!
[01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:18.786]  And thank you for what you're doing.
[01:02:19.087 --> 01:02:21.247]  I hope the analysts out there are listening.
[01:02:21.827 --> 01:02:23.228]  Don't forget to plug the tapes.
[01:02:23.248 --> 01:02:24.408]  That's the most important thing.
[01:02:24.428 --> 01:02:25.389]  That's how we can get it out.
[01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:28.650]  Well, you know, it's people like you, Charles.
[01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.750]  You've called before.
[01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:32.211]  You've given out over 5,000 tapes in your area.
[01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:32.851]  Look what it's done.
[01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:38.375]  Oh yeah, well, it's a small area, but I've got Tatsuma and Walka, and I'm working on another one now.
[01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:42.578]  It's kind of hard, but something like last night makes it worth it, Mr. Jones.
[01:02:42.798 --> 01:02:43.639]  You feel good.
[01:02:43.939 --> 01:02:46.621]  You see your work coming to the top, you know?
[01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:47.622]  Well done!
[01:02:47.642 --> 01:02:49.003]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:49.083 --> 01:02:50.464]  Very well done, Charles.
[01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:52.045]  Thomas and Mask.
[01:02:52.065 --> 01:02:52.826]  Go ahead, Thomas.
[01:02:54.407 --> 01:02:54.727]  Hello?
[01:02:55.008 --> 01:02:55.268]  Yes.
[01:02:55.908 --> 01:02:56.809]  Um, how are you doing, sir?
[01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.349]  Good!
[01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:58.430]  Okay.
[01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.913]  You know, mentioning, you know, inside jobs and all of that.
[01:03:02.711 --> 01:03:10.053]  And obviously more and more people are becoming aware of the fact that people are trying to cover up the actual fact.
[01:03:10.813 --> 01:03:21.677]  As a matter of fact, there's a new film about 9-11 out right now that's very popular from an individual named Dylan Avery called Loose Change.
[01:03:22.117 --> 01:03:23.497]  Are you familiar with that film?
[01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:24.317]  Yeah!
[01:03:24.397 --> 01:03:25.618]  No, we just talked about it earlier.
[01:03:26.358 --> 01:03:26.458]  Ah!
[01:03:27.958 --> 01:03:28.799]  What are your thoughts on it?
[01:03:28.819 --> 01:03:30.099]  I think it's pretty good.
[01:03:31.061 --> 01:03:33.623]  We put a clip of it up on prisonplanet.com and promote it.
[01:03:34.124 --> 01:03:34.804]  Alright.
[01:03:35.224 --> 01:03:35.545]  Cool.
[01:03:36.405 --> 01:03:37.806]  And one more question.
[01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:48.255]  I heard a rumor years ago that you said that your mentor was a guy named Gordon Novell.
[01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:49.876]  Is that true?
[01:03:50.156 --> 01:03:51.738]  And if so... Let's just stay there.
[01:03:51.918 --> 01:03:53.299]  I'll answer your question on the other side.
[01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:57.526]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.786 --> 01:03:59.366]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.706 --> 01:04:04.367]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:09.149]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:13.770]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:14.610]  The Constitution
[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.390]  We're good to go.

[01:05:29.544 --> 01:05:31.405]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.

[01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:49.098]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:49.198 --> 01:06:49.798]  Alright, cast him!
[01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:18.887]  Central American Free Trade Agreement, which literally merges us, one of the final steps for the free trade area of the Americas, which is just like the EU started as the free trade area of Europe, or the European Economic Community to be precise in the name.
[01:07:19.651 --> 01:07:21.232]  That is the end of our sovereignty.
[01:07:22.253 --> 01:07:24.194]  A dollarized currency.
[01:07:25.735 --> 01:07:28.677]  We're talking about merging our military and police.
[01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:31.218]  It's all over the big Canadian and Mexican newspapers.
[01:07:31.658 --> 01:07:33.519]  And Venezuelan and Guatemalan newspapers.
[01:07:33.559 --> 01:07:36.241]  The average American is totally, totally unaware of this.
[01:07:37.282 --> 01:07:38.883]  That passed the House last Friday.
[01:07:38.903 --> 01:07:40.944]  Excuse me, passed the Senate last Friday.
[01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.046]  The full Senate, it's now in the House on the verge of passing.
[01:07:44.713 --> 01:07:49.821]  They're talking about Alberto Gonzalez for the Attorney General becoming on the Supreme Court.
[01:07:50.402 --> 01:07:53.227]  Now Novak, who's got the inside, who said...
[01:07:53.914 --> 01:07:58.055]  You know, a week before, five days before, that O'Connor was going to be leaving.
[01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.616]  He's now saying Rehnquist may leave in the next week.
[01:08:01.056 --> 01:08:02.937]  Regardless, he's going to be leaving in the next six months.
[01:08:02.957 --> 01:08:06.097]  I mean, the guy's literally hanging on to life by his fingernails.
[01:08:06.898 --> 01:08:07.778]  That's happening.
[01:08:08.698 --> 01:08:12.319]  We have got all this forced drugging and we're fighting the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:08:12.699 --> 01:08:15.480]  We've got the open borders and the Border Patrol being ordered to stand down.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.421]  We're on the verge of more government-sponsored terrorism at any time.
[01:08:19.801 --> 01:08:21.862]  We're in a very dangerous position right now.
[01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:27.463]  And I've got the G8 rallying and trying to promote their police state.
[01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:30.324]  I've got all this news and your calls and like a hundred emails.
[01:08:30.684 --> 01:08:31.824]  I want to read like ten of them.
[01:08:31.844 --> 01:08:32.684]  Some of them are lengthy.
[01:08:33.244 --> 01:08:34.465]  We've got two guests coming up.
[01:08:36.065 --> 01:08:46.088]  And if I spent all day responding to the mythology and the propaganda and the just ridiculous lies that are told about me, we wouldn't have a broadcast.
[01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:51.589]  We'd be like all the other Patriot shows that are failures because they just descend into COINTELPRO taking the bait.
[01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:56.480]  But, uh, we got open phones, folks, and we take your calls, unless you're one of my stalkers.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.121]  A few of those.
[01:08:57.982 --> 01:09:00.285]  Uh, and, uh, Thomas and Mass called in.
[01:09:00.685 --> 01:09:01.726]  Some stations may not have heard it.
[01:09:02.287 --> 01:09:03.048]  He's on with us right now.
[01:09:03.068 --> 01:09:03.909]  We'll go to him in a second.
[01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:11.859]  And, uh, he propagated, uh, he asked the question, uh, just one of the more ridiculous of the things that's been said about me.
[01:09:13.047 --> 01:09:13.808]  And responding to it.
[01:09:13.828 --> 01:09:15.028]  People say, well, why don't you respond?
[01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:18.210]  Because then there'll always be someone new with these recycled lies.
[01:09:18.570 --> 01:09:19.471]  You'll have to respond to that.
[01:09:19.571 --> 01:09:21.612]  Respond, respond, respond, respond, respond.
[01:09:22.053 --> 01:09:25.795]  But just so people know why I don't respond, if it's pure lies, I won't respond.
[01:09:26.075 --> 01:09:39.023]  If somebody's trying to fight with me on some issue of the New World Order or, you know, Ben Chertoff, you know, the cousin of the Homeland Security Director, writing giant front-page, you know, magazine articles attacking me savagely and lying about me, I'll respond to that.
[01:09:40.304 --> 01:09:42.465]  But just kangaroo craziness
[01:09:43.744 --> 01:09:45.126]  Let me just say it for you right now.
[01:09:45.146 --> 01:09:53.817]  I am not the 55 year old Alex Jones who is a public relations person for Scientologists.
[01:09:53.937 --> 01:09:55.379]  I don't know any Scientologists.
[01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:56.921]  I am not a Scientologist.
[01:09:56.961 --> 01:09:58.623]  I just said this two days ago.
[01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:04.223]  I am not the billionaire Alex Jones who owns factories in Canada.
[01:10:04.663 --> 01:10:05.903]  I'm not 70-something years old.
[01:10:06.423 --> 01:10:07.064]  Okay, folks?
[01:10:07.724 --> 01:10:13.106]  I am not Alex Jones, the accomplished photographer and videographer who lives in Austin, Texas.
[01:10:13.706 --> 01:10:15.067]  There are so many Alex Joneses.
[01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:19.248]  I am not the Alex Jones that runs the Shorenstein Center.
[01:10:19.868 --> 01:10:20.269]  Okay?
[01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:26.131]  And then on this other issue, I have been at a St.
[01:10:26.211 --> 01:10:26.671]  Andrews
[01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:30.311]  Lunch one time, where my sister goes to school.
[01:10:31.051 --> 01:10:32.312]  She's like 15 years younger than me.
[01:10:34.053 --> 01:10:35.134]  Back when Bush was governor.
[01:10:35.594 --> 01:10:39.277]  And I have actually sat at the same table with George Bush and eaten a barbecue.
[01:10:40.598 --> 01:10:44.500]  I have also confronted George Bush when he was governor, years later, and been arrested.
[01:10:45.721 --> 01:10:48.143]  And I have protested outside the governor's mansion.
[01:10:48.363 --> 01:10:52.946]  And so I have been closer to George Bush than I have been closer to Gordon Novell.
[01:10:53.996 --> 01:10:55.096]  Who we've had as a guest.
[01:10:55.236 --> 01:10:57.517]  And Gordon Novell, I don't even think he's a bad guy, number one.
[01:10:58.277 --> 01:11:05.379]  I think I've been around him three times, once at a mass dinner after a Waco remembrance, I think on the sixth anniversary, or seventh anniversary.
[01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:08.599]  And I didn't even sit at the same table with him, but I did talk to him.
[01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:12.380]  And he was involved with the CIA, exposing the Kennedy assassination.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:20.062]  He was involved also in helping get the flare footage out of the public of the feds shooting the Davidians.
[01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:26.678]  And then one other time I was at a Patriot dinner and he was there and I had him on as a guest once.
[01:11:27.678 --> 01:11:32.560]  And then some crackpot goes on the radio and says he's my mentor, he's a billionaire, he controls me.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.721]  Number one, Gordon Novell, I don't even think he's a millionaire.
[01:11:35.301 --> 01:11:37.302]  And I'm controlled by Gordon Novell.
[01:11:37.742 --> 01:11:38.642]  No, no, no, you got it wrong.
[01:11:38.702 --> 01:11:42.744]  I'm George Bush because I was arrested by him and I was nearing and one time about
[01:11:43.945 --> 01:11:45.026]  Must have been eight, nine years ago.
[01:11:45.926 --> 01:11:47.527]  I ate at a table with George Bush.
[01:11:47.847 --> 01:11:48.947]  I ate sausage, folks.
[01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:51.408]  So does that answer your question?
[01:11:51.769 --> 01:11:54.870]  I also protested Bill Clinton, so I must be under Bill Clinton's control.
[01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:56.931]  So anybody I get close to, ever, I'm controlled by.
[01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:58.592]  Does that answer your question, Thomas?
[01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.032]  Enough time on that?
[01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:06.415]  Yes, I was just trying to clear... I'll clear it up for the next 50 people, too.
[01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.736]  Listen, anything else?
[01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:11.518]  You want to talk about how we're on the verge of having nuclear attacks and smallpox being released?
[01:12:11.538 --> 01:12:12.258]  Does that concern you?
[01:12:13.127 --> 01:12:13.567]  Um, yes.
[01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:17.049]  What also concerns me is what people are actually doing about it.
[01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.789]  Yeah.
[01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.951]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:12:20.511 --> 01:12:23.012]  I mean, again, this is what I deal with, folks.
[01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.514]  And it's just classic.
[01:12:27.254 --> 01:12:27.874]  It's just classic.
[01:12:29.755 --> 01:12:40.801]  And it's the type of... What you have is sniveling losers who are egomaniacs, who don't have lives, who I've never even done anything bad to.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.622]  Who literally are mad that I work 18 hours a day.
[01:12:46.063 --> 01:12:53.209]  Uh, who, who, who I guess wish they weren't lazy and so they make up other, the same person that said that made up other ridiculous things about me.
[01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.492]  And, and, and again, this broadcast is not about Alex Jones!
[01:12:58.894 --> 01:12:59.174]  Okay?
[01:13:00.049 --> 01:13:04.051]  I mean, there's whole websites dedicated to how I'm this 55-year-old Scientologist.
[01:13:04.091 --> 01:13:06.372]  Folks, I'm 31 years old, okay?
[01:13:06.452 --> 01:13:09.973]  I'm not... There's... but see, one thing George Bush said that's true.
[01:13:10.393 --> 01:13:12.874]  There is no way to disprove a negative.
[01:13:12.914 --> 01:13:17.996]  It's like if somebody stands up at a press conference and says, there are reports that you raped your wife.
[01:13:18.016 --> 01:13:20.637]  I mean, what does that mean?
[01:13:21.218 --> 01:13:22.598]  How are you supposed to respond to that?
[01:13:24.259 --> 01:13:25.519]  And there is no way to respond.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.141]  You can even sue the person and win, but people remember the headline.
[01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:48.743]  So, there is a disease in the Patriot Movement and in the Truth Movement, where, where literally about half the time is spent, because they're provocateurs, some of them are government agents, most of them aren't, they're just egomaniacs, who literally, I mean, I've seen it folks, I do radio interviews every day.
[01:13:49.484 --> 01:13:54.308]  And when I do these interviews, you know, on a small AM station, I might be talking to 5,000 people, that's still huge.
[01:13:54.628 --> 01:13:58.151]  Or on some big syndicated show, I might be talking to 16 million people per hour.
[01:13:59.708 --> 01:14:00.448]  I get excited.
[01:14:00.488 --> 01:14:02.990]  My adrenaline gets up about that because I'm a realist.
[01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.410]  I know, man, I'm talking to a big crowd.
[01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:05.911]  But I see these other individuals.
[01:14:05.931 --> 01:14:09.092]  You get in front of a crowd of a hundred people, folks go crazy.
[01:14:09.132 --> 01:14:11.073]  It's like primitive monkey behavior.
[01:14:11.494 --> 01:14:12.574]  Oh, man, I'm in front of a big crowd.
[01:14:12.594 --> 01:14:13.454]  I'm a tribal leader.
[01:14:13.835 --> 01:14:18.197]  They have to physically see the crowd to be able... They can't visualize it.
[01:14:18.797 --> 01:14:22.018]  This is a psychological example of the things we face.
[01:14:22.319 --> 01:14:23.379]  And then people act weird.
[01:14:23.419 --> 01:14:24.360]  They get on power trips.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.440]  They start fights.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.221]  Folks, it isn't about that.
[01:14:27.785 --> 01:14:29.406]  You're going to lose your pension funds.
[01:14:29.526 --> 01:14:31.307]  You're going to lose your jobs.
[01:14:31.327 --> 01:14:33.249]  You're going to lose control of your children.
[01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:36.751]  You're going to live in a total police state with troops on the street corners.
[01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:38.652]  I mean, I'm actually upset about this.
[01:14:38.752 --> 01:14:40.173]  I'm actually worried about this.
[01:14:40.733 --> 01:14:44.976]  I actually don't get to spend a lot of time with my family, even though I love to do that more than anything else.
[01:14:46.317 --> 01:14:48.138]  Because all I do is work, folks.
[01:14:48.198 --> 01:14:52.501]  I mean, I was up at one o'clock in the morning last night, you know, working on making some new films.
[01:14:53.562 --> 01:14:56.183]  And again, folks, I would much rather have been in bed.
[01:14:56.343 --> 01:14:57.124]  I was exhausted.
[01:14:59.385 --> 01:15:02.427]  And again, we've just spent seven, eight minutes on this.
[01:15:02.587 --> 01:15:03.868]  It's shameful!
[01:15:04.769 --> 01:15:16.077]  You want to be ashamed of yourselves whenever you go around parroting just total... Folks, let's say I'm a reptoid from planet Klu Klor.
[01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:19.539]  That's as legitimate as I'm a 55-year-old Scientologist, okay?
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.622]  Does it matter if I'm a reptoid from planet Klu Klob?
[01:15:25.305 --> 01:15:25.505]  No!
[01:15:25.885 --> 01:15:27.546]  The information is what matters.
[01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:30.567]  It doesn't matter if Alex Jones is a good guy or a bad guy.
[01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:41.651]  Folks, I'm the most genuine person and that's why I have the biggest audience because people in their guts know for all my foibles, all my interruptions, all my perseverating, all of it, people know it's real!
[01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:43.152]  This is real, folks!
[01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.072]  The New World Order is real!
[01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:45.873]  I predict what the New World Order is going to do!
[01:15:45.893 --> 01:15:47.714]  I understand what the New World Order is going to do!
[01:15:47.734 --> 01:16:07.843]  I live my life doing this, and we need soldiers, we need leaders, we need people to go out and talk about real issues, and fight the land grabbing, and fight the gun grabbing, and fight the CPS child grabbing, and fight the vaccine contamination, and fight the DU, our troops, and the Iraqis we're being exposed to.
[01:16:08.243 --> 01:16:10.904]  We've got to get our heads screwed on straight!
[01:16:12.592 --> 01:16:14.635]  I mean, they got manuals on COINTELPRO.
[01:16:14.996 --> 01:16:20.083]  COINTELPRO has people out there that disseminate lies and attack others in a movement to bring it down.
[01:16:20.664 --> 01:16:21.726]  You fools!
[01:16:22.907 --> 01:16:25.992]  I know most of you don't buy into this, but you can hear that just...
[01:16:26.565 --> 01:16:29.026]  Jibbering mindlessness.
[01:16:29.106 --> 01:16:30.587]  I can always tell in somebody's voice.
[01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:33.308]  You know, just a jibbering idiot.
[01:16:33.528 --> 01:16:34.728]  You are not connected.
[01:16:35.089 --> 01:16:36.169]  You are not on.
[01:16:36.449 --> 01:16:38.070]  Your head is not screwed on straight.
[01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:48.054]  You need to be slapped upside the head and by reality to realize we're facing serious issues for the species itself.
[01:16:49.028 --> 01:17:01.717]  If you were connected to God, if you had the Holy Spirit, if you had any thimble of discernment, if you could grasp anything, you would know what was serious, you would know what needed to be focused on.
[01:17:03.078 --> 01:17:03.758]  Okay, there you go.
[01:17:04.199 --> 01:17:05.980]  Totally wasted time, folks.
[01:17:07.141 --> 01:17:14.666]  Let's go ahead and... I'm tempted, though, to do a whole show attacking all these people, because I would destroy them.
[01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:15.947]  But you know what?
[01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.647]  We've got to stay focused on the New World Order.
[01:17:18.687 --> 01:17:20.147]  We've got to defeat them.
[01:17:20.387 --> 01:17:22.048]  That's the citadels of power.
[01:17:22.728 --> 01:17:26.549]  That's the pyramidal enemies that are launching attacks on us.
[01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:29.630]  You know how bloodthirsty the Globalist are?
[01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:33.172]  Do you know how close we are to just all-out enslavement, folks?
[01:17:33.632 --> 01:17:34.732]  But we're in the fight.
[01:17:34.932 --> 01:17:39.954]  We need every one of you to stay focused on real issues and to stay focused on the New World Order.
[01:17:40.414 --> 01:17:41.595]  We're on a razor's edge.
[01:17:41.655 --> 01:17:42.655]  It could tip either way.
[01:17:43.331 --> 01:17:46.694]  We need you to put out the maximum effort now against the enemy!
[01:17:46.714 --> 01:17:52.098]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to David in Florida.
[01:17:52.118 --> 01:17:52.779]  David, go ahead.
[01:17:53.479 --> 01:18:00.185]  Alex, that was not wasted time because let me tell you, my heart was racing and I was really scared to even tell you what I'm about to tell you.
[01:18:00.585 --> 01:18:02.767]  But after what you just said, I felt like I just went to church.
[01:18:02.787 --> 01:18:06.110]  I mean, I am so pumped now to tell you.
[01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:07.311]  I work here in Florida.
[01:18:07.331 --> 01:18:08.592]  I'm in the space industry.
[01:18:09.246 --> 01:18:09.646]  I don't know.
[01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:10.327]  I'm starting to shake.
[01:18:10.387 --> 01:18:11.928]  I'm starting to get nervous about this.
[01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:14.409]  But I'm going to tell you what the next event is going to be.
[01:18:14.429 --> 01:18:17.311]  I don't know if you know that NASA is losing money.
[01:18:17.351 --> 01:18:18.532]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:18:19.353 --> 01:18:24.036]  Well, that's what the ETH Impact Project is about.
[01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:30.500]  It's something to detour everybody from Bush and all of this 9-11 stuff and the war.
[01:18:30.981 --> 01:18:37.505]  Because they figured if they could do something catastrophic that they can get us to be submissive again.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.764]  Stay there and give us your kernel of info when we get back.
[01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:49.109]  Just stay there, David, and get it out on the other side, and we'll talk to Rodney and Ron and William and others.
[01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.930]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:18:54.574 --> 01:18:55.835]  Currency devaluation.
[01:18:56.635 --> 01:18:57.196]  Inflation.
[01:18:57.856 --> 01:18:58.477]  One and the same.
[01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:04.183]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:19:04.203 --> 01:19:05.503]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:19:05.523 --> 01:19:06.224]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:19:06.264 --> 01:19:07.704]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:19:23.793 --> 01:19:24.674]  Here is reality.
[01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:28.575]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:19:29.716 --> 01:19:33.398]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:19:34.138 --> 01:19:38.020]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.602]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:19:42.722 --> 01:19:44.583]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.623 --> 01:19:44.883]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.360]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.601]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.622]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:02.722 --> 01:20:09.424]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:09.624 --> 01:20:12.624]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:12.824 --> 01:20:15.225]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:15.345 --> 01:20:23.227]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:20:23.507 --> 01:20:34.829]  Methazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:20:34.969 --> 01:20:43.771]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:43.791 --> 01:20:43.991]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:56.191]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.211 --> 01:21:05.454]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:06.434 --> 01:21:11.356]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:21:12.436 --> 01:21:14.237]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:14.657 --> 01:21:15.417]  There may be more.
[01:21:16.614 --> 01:21:23.419]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:21:24.099 --> 01:21:31.944]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:53.664 --> 01:22:00.027]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:05.309]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:22:05.589 --> 01:22:13.493]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:13.653 --> 01:22:20.696]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:22.117]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:22.277 --> 01:22:25.658]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:25.718 --> 01:22:26.819]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:22:27.119 --> 01:22:28.400]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:35.443]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:22:35.543 --> 01:22:38.044]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:22:47.589 --> 01:22:51.211]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:22:51.271 --> 01:23:02.416]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:03.017 --> 01:23:05.998]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.399 --> 01:23:11.921]  The globalists have the motives for the bombings yesterday in London.
[01:23:13.248 --> 01:23:23.497]  And that in the past that these very individuals have carried out terrorist attacks as a pretext for control and to legitimize their policies and now the evidence of prior knowledge is pouring out.
[01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:28.590]  It is just all over the place, and we'll be recapping that with Jack Blood coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:30.751]  Let's try to get through some more of these calls.
[01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:36.114]  David in Florida, get to the info for us, and I appreciate you calling.
[01:23:36.134 --> 01:23:36.454]  Go ahead.
[01:23:36.474 --> 01:23:37.855]  Okay, I'll just do this real quick.
[01:23:37.875 --> 01:23:39.136]  You're saying you work for NASA?
[01:23:39.436 --> 01:23:40.436]  No, no, no.
[01:23:40.556 --> 01:23:41.097]  I didn't say that.
[01:23:41.137 --> 01:23:42.137]  Okay, I thought I got that from you.
[01:23:42.157 --> 01:23:43.778]  You said, NASA, I work here.
[01:23:43.798 --> 01:23:44.479]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:23:44.559 --> 01:23:44.839]  No, no, no.
[01:23:44.899 --> 01:23:46.060]  I work in the space industry.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.060]  Space industry, okay.
[01:23:47.781 --> 01:23:48.301]  But NASA?
[01:23:48.951 --> 01:23:51.133]  Uh, we're, uh, have been losing their funding.
[01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:52.274]  And the government... Yeah, they have been.
[01:23:52.294 --> 01:23:52.914]  So, I mean, tell us.
[01:23:53.355 --> 01:23:56.977]  So, if, if the government said, you could do this for us, we'll, we'll help you out.
[01:23:57.638 --> 01:23:58.899]  So, that's how they stayed afloat.
[01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:02.682]  They did this deep in... Well, now, you said the next, you say you know what the next event is.
[01:24:02.702 --> 01:24:03.503]  Do you have any evidence?
[01:24:04.503 --> 01:24:08.306]  The, the shuttle, when it goes up, it's going to be forced to come down due to a meteor shower.
[01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:17.854]  The meteor shower is the explosion fragment from Temple One's explosion on July 4th at 152 AM, which was almost ten times bigger than what they were expecting.
[01:24:18.374 --> 01:24:24.080]  Yeah, but I mean, Tempel 1 was millions of miles away of something ridiculous.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.883]  But an explosion with nothing to slow it down in space?
[01:24:28.744 --> 01:24:29.185]  Think about it.
[01:24:29.385 --> 01:24:31.547]  Do you have any mathematic equations to show that?
[01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:33.329]  Not that I can give you.
[01:24:33.349 --> 01:24:37.533]  Is this what people are saying internally inside NASA?
[01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:42.217]  Yeah, there's a bunch of groups that are speaking about it.
[01:24:43.459 --> 01:24:46.262]  One group in California called Cyber Corps is really, they've been discussing it.
[01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:57.292]  But I thought Temple One wasn't coming anywhere near the Earth, so how would... Temple One is the reason why the Vatican almost illegally built their observatory in Arizona and bypassed all political red tape.
[01:24:57.592 --> 01:25:00.454]  I'll say it's weird to send a probe and smash it into it.
[01:25:01.015 --> 01:25:04.398]  It's because the comet will not, I mean, it won't hit us.
[01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:05.619]  The dust fragments will.
[01:25:06.079 --> 01:25:08.562]  That will be the freaking meteor shower here in about a week or two.
[01:25:09.247 --> 01:25:17.633]  And then the comet itself will come between us and the sun, pulling out our electromagnetic sphere, causing the solar flares to be able to penetrate us, basically radiating people.
[01:25:18.234 --> 01:25:23.077]  And that's why... Okay, hey, listen... ...all the bases underground, and they're closing other military bases.
[01:25:24.598 --> 01:25:26.280]  They're closing other military bases.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.782]  Alright, well, David, call me back.
[01:25:28.882 --> 01:25:32.404]  When is this supposed to happen?
[01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:35.967]  The shuttle launches on the 13th, and it'll be while it's in orbit.
[01:25:36.967 --> 01:25:38.507]  It's like predicting a baby.
[01:25:38.727 --> 01:25:40.528]  I know NASA is all into the occult.
[01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:42.388]  The names of their projects are all occult.
[01:25:42.668 --> 01:25:44.348]  Look at what happened to Apollo 13.
[01:25:44.448 --> 01:25:45.448]  Is the launch really on the 13th?
[01:25:45.569 --> 01:25:46.689]  Yes, it is.
[01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:49.029]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:25:49.209 --> 01:25:50.089]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:50.509 --> 01:25:53.970]  Again, I don't believe in superstition and numerology and all that, but the globalists do.
[01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:55.430]  They're obsessed with it.
[01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:57.651]  The vastness of space, folks.
[01:25:57.691 --> 01:26:02.311]  Temple 1, that pickle-shaped thing, it's way out there.
[01:26:03.652 --> 01:26:05.552]  They sent a couple hundred pound
[01:26:06.587 --> 01:26:09.328]  You know, the thing into it and it caused an explosion.
[01:26:09.388 --> 01:26:13.229]  I just... I mean, see folks, we got... I just... Oh, man.
[01:26:13.849 --> 01:26:14.409]  Oh, help us.
[01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:17.610]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:18.590]  Rodney, go ahead.
[01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:19.851]  Alex, how are you?
[01:26:20.211 --> 01:26:21.011]  I'm doing alright.
[01:26:21.331 --> 01:26:22.591]  I'm glad to hear that.
[01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:25.752]  I'm worried about the globalists nuking us.
[01:26:25.772 --> 01:26:27.473]  You know, they say the terrorists are going to nuke us.
[01:26:27.493 --> 01:26:28.733]  They're going to release smallpox.
[01:26:29.113 --> 01:26:35.695]  I know how ruthless the globalists are, but instead we seem to be... And I'm not trying to poo-poo the caller, but we're worried about comets.
[01:26:36.599 --> 01:26:42.441]  Yeah, I had a couple of questions about some statements that Bush made about, you know, he's urging Americans to be
[01:26:51.912 --> 01:26:57.237]  Well, actually the word they used was he's warning Americans to be extremely vigilant.
[01:26:57.277 --> 01:27:01.600]  Yes, we better be afraid, we better give up all of our liberties to them or the evil terrorist will get us.
[01:27:02.141 --> 01:27:12.710]  Okay, now something else that I didn't hear very much about other than from your website, and this was concerning the two small explosions up in New York.
[01:27:13.987 --> 01:27:19.009]  My question is, Alex, how many hours behind or ahead of... Let me be specific.
[01:27:19.389 --> 01:27:22.309]  They had reports of 10 bombings, 8 bombings in England.
[01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:24.490]  They had reports of, you know, thousands and all this.
[01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:25.410]  That wasn't correct.
[01:27:25.810 --> 01:27:33.872]  In all the hysteria, somebody took a BBC article, put a new date on it, and put it out that there had been some firecrackers or something, you know, detonated.
[01:27:33.892 --> 01:27:38.274]  That was actually back in May, on Election Day, so that was a false report.
[01:27:38.314 --> 01:27:39.414]  We corrected that within minutes.
[01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:44.858]  No, no, I'm talking about the two explosions up in New York at the British Embassy yesterday.
[01:27:44.878 --> 01:27:45.859]  No, no, that was old.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.922]  Oh, that was old, oh my goodness.
[01:27:49.582 --> 01:27:51.724]  And I gave out some misinformation.
[01:27:51.784 --> 01:27:53.425]  Well, suddenly people were putting that out.
[01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.348]  That happens when something like this develops.
[01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:59.971]  Yeah, I feel bad now because I... Hey, nobody's perfect, brother.
[01:28:00.011 --> 01:28:01.592]  At least we try to tell the truth here.
[01:28:01.612 --> 01:28:03.013]  The globalists try to twist.
[01:28:03.373 --> 01:28:04.975]  Yeah, but now here's the other thing.
[01:28:05.905 --> 01:28:16.672]  You know, I called another program yesterday on GCN because I had visited your website and picked up on some information that I wasn't hearing over some of the other broadcasts.
[01:28:16.772 --> 01:28:21.015]  And I mentioned that you had reported on your website that
[01:28:21.335 --> 01:28:27.116]  That Israel, the embassy there in London and Netanyahu had been warned ahead of time.
[01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:27.996]  Yes, that's admitted.
[01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:32.417]  But now you're saying that AP went and retracted the story.
[01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:33.718]  Yeah, thanks for the call, Rodney.
[01:28:33.738 --> 01:28:34.998]  I'll comment on it on the other side.
[01:28:35.538 --> 01:28:36.658]  They didn't really retract it.
[01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.799]  And that report is real and documented.
[01:28:40.119 --> 01:28:41.079]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.000]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.100]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:50.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:55.325 --> 01:30:58.908]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:30:59.028 --> 01:30:59.408]  Shocking?
[01:30:59.508 --> 01:30:59.968]  Of course!
[01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:02.290]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:05.352]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:31:05.533 --> 01:31:06.894]  Forewarned is forearmed.

[01:32:01.117 --> 01:32:03.878]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:06.522]  All right.
[01:32:07.642 --> 01:32:10.163]  We've got Jack Blood up with us from his own broadcast.
[01:32:10.203 --> 01:32:12.783]  It comes on right after this one ends at 2 o'clock central.
[01:32:12.803 --> 01:32:27.026]  For the next 30 minutes, we have an expert on South Africa, Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, all of it, and how, we're talking back in the 50s, they had anti-terror laws, and of course it was the government and others behind the terror to bring in control.
[01:32:27.066 --> 01:32:31.326]  Coming up the third hour, of course, we'll continue to cover and recap what happened in London.
[01:32:32.086 --> 01:32:35.087]  Before we go any further, to stay focused on real issues of significance,
[01:32:36.743 --> 01:32:41.146]  Don't forget, the British government's been caught carrying out terror attacks as a pretext for control.
[01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:42.407]  The Russian government's been caught.
[01:32:42.787 --> 01:32:43.688]  The Israeli government.
[01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:45.909]  I mean, publicly admitted, not debatable.
[01:32:46.450 --> 01:32:46.930]  The U.S.
[01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:48.031]  government's been caught doing it.
[01:32:48.331 --> 01:32:49.492]  Hitler was caught doing it.
[01:32:50.132 --> 01:32:51.733]  They do it over and over again.
[01:32:51.793 --> 01:32:55.136]  Machiavelli in The Prince talked about it 500 years ago.
[01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:57.197]  This is their favorite tactic.
[01:32:57.417 --> 01:33:01.780]  And here is George Galloway, about a month ago on my broadcast, senior member in the British Parliament,
[01:33:02.409 --> 01:33:10.574]  Well, right at the end of the broadcast, we're talking about the invasion of Israel, Israel invading Iran, or the U.S.
[01:33:10.594 --> 01:33:13.896]  doing it, and he was saying, well, they don't have the political capital to do it.
[01:33:13.916 --> 01:33:18.218]  And I said, what if our government, the military-industrial complex, carries out an attack?
[01:33:18.238 --> 01:33:20.559]  And he said, yes, that is a very real threat.
[01:33:20.899 --> 01:33:22.560]  That's exactly what these monkeys do.
[01:33:23.101 --> 01:33:25.262]  See, I mean, this is just common sense, folks.
[01:33:25.742 --> 01:33:27.563]  Not just the motive, not just the evidence.
[01:33:27.883 --> 01:33:30.365]  So roll that, we're going to Jack, and then back to your calls.
[01:33:31.065 --> 01:33:35.668]  Undoubtedly they planned to go into Iran and Syria for that matter.
[01:33:36.108 --> 01:33:41.070]  But I don't believe that the public opinion in your country or mine would follow them there.
[01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:44.052]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[01:33:44.092 --> 01:33:46.273]  They're saying they'll go ahead and may attack Iran.
[01:33:46.813 --> 01:33:54.582]  Well, there was an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[01:33:55.023 --> 01:33:59.488]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one he'll have to count us out.
[01:33:59.868 --> 01:34:02.111]  What if Israel drags us in?
[01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:03.493]  Well, that's a possibility.
[01:34:03.913 --> 01:34:05.295]  Israel might strike Iran.
[01:34:05.942 --> 01:34:12.486]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:14.908]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:34:14.968 --> 01:34:15.828]  Well, I have another article.
[01:34:16.049 --> 01:34:18.710]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:22.513]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[01:34:22.873 --> 01:34:26.715]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[01:34:26.816 --> 01:34:33.560]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:34.320]  Alright.
[01:34:34.601 --> 01:34:35.522]  We got 30 seconds.
[01:34:35.562 --> 01:34:43.709]  What do we do if the military industrial complex carries out a terror attack to blame it on them?
[01:34:51.295 --> 01:34:54.338]  Uh, well that's, uh, another, uh, very real, uh, danger.
[01:34:54.398 --> 01:35:00.364]  There's no way that we can, uh, uh, legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[01:35:00.404 --> 01:35:02.546]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[01:35:02.946 --> 01:35:03.587]  Unbelievable!
[01:35:03.887 --> 01:35:04.147]  Mr. Galloway?
[01:35:04.167 --> 01:35:09.052]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[01:35:09.072 --> 01:35:09.873]  I salute you!
[01:35:09.893 --> 01:35:11.094]  Thank you very much.
[01:35:11.818 --> 01:35:12.498]  Alright, folks.
[01:35:12.518 --> 01:35:13.619]  Let's go to Jack Blood.
[01:35:14.019 --> 01:35:16.681]  Of course, he's got the website jackblood.com and net.
[01:35:17.441 --> 01:35:22.924]  Jack, give us your analysis, in a nutshell, of the attacks in London.
[01:35:22.964 --> 01:35:25.766]  Specifically, the evidence of what happened there.
[01:35:25.846 --> 01:35:27.967]  And maybe you want to start with answering Rodney's question.
[01:35:28.507 --> 01:35:31.749]  Well first I want to say it's an honor to be on your program Alex, and I want to welcome all fellow Londoners.
[01:35:31.769 --> 01:35:33.730]  You know, we're all Londoners now Alex!
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.224]  That's part of the spin and the rhetoric coming out now.
[01:35:51.364 --> 01:35:52.505]  Signs all over the world.
[01:35:52.826 --> 01:35:54.168]  We're all Londoners.
[01:35:54.328 --> 01:35:57.312]  I guess we've been saying that for years, at least financially.
[01:35:57.332 --> 01:36:02.158]  But when a smart bomb goes wrong and kills 75 people in Mud Huts, it's no big deal.
[01:36:03.286 --> 01:36:04.827]  Are we all on infallusions?
[01:36:19.924 --> 01:36:24.166]  for Al-Qaeda involved with this London bombing is actually pretty hysterical, Alex.
[01:36:24.186 --> 01:36:43.153]  I mean, they are really, really reaching, and I ought to tell you that if I report something on my radio show, or you report something on your radio show, that was based off of a message board on the internet, and I had, say, I had Gerald Posner on my program, and if I tried to use that type of source or information with him, he'd laugh me right off the air, Alex.
[01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:43.814]  Yeah, he's the
[01:36:44.856 --> 01:36:46.776]  Weak debunker of stuff like Kennedy.
[01:36:46.976 --> 01:36:47.777]  You know what he said?
[01:36:47.817 --> 01:36:55.678]  I saw him last night on Keith Oberman and the first sentence out of his mouth is, this will be a reminder to all those who don't support the war on terror.
[01:36:56.298 --> 01:36:57.518]  That's really what this is all about.
[01:36:57.538 --> 01:36:58.639]  See, we told you so.
[01:36:58.919 --> 01:37:00.739]  You better do what we say now.
[01:37:01.239 --> 01:37:11.521]  Well, and I think that's exactly what they meant this to be, is a quote, reminder to those of us who aren't behind this international and never-ending war on terror.
[01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:20.495]  I'll tell you, Jack, Netanyahu came out on Israeli government radio, Army radio, that he'd been given a warning.
[01:37:21.316 --> 01:37:30.604]  It's been in major Israeli papers, and now, the first they retracted, but then even the retraction has one of their ministers going, no, we did get the warning right beforehand.
[01:37:30.804 --> 01:37:34.467]  I got the warning, not Netanyahu, and then we gave it to him.
[01:37:34.627 --> 01:37:36.268]  Well, that's not a retraction at all.
[01:37:36.328 --> 01:37:39.131]  That is incredible mental gymnastics
[01:37:39.691 --> 01:37:51.480]  And then now it's admitted that he did get the warning beforehand and then for an hour and a half they were saying it was electrical transformers exploding when the police knew instantly it was bombings with a bus splattered all over the place.
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:56.243]  They could have warned all the people going to the London Underground as they knew about at least an hour before time.
[01:37:56.263 --> 01:37:56.704]  That's it.
[01:37:56.724 --> 01:38:00.106]  You know, that's a good reason why they didn't want to warn people and have it come out.
[01:38:00.186 --> 01:38:00.787]  Everything's fine.
[01:38:00.807 --> 01:38:02.068]  Keep going into the London Underground.
[01:38:02.268 --> 01:38:02.908]  Let me touch on this.
[01:38:02.968 --> 01:38:06.251]  Also, if these are real terrorists, Jack, why haven't they taken credit?
[01:38:06.391 --> 01:38:07.672]  Oh, we've got a message board.
[01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:13.799]  Yeah, and of course that is put out as real news, as a real fact throughout the internet.
[01:38:14.279 --> 01:38:22.528]  And then they quietly come out, though, and retract it hours later and say, OK, it wasn't credible, but still it's all over neocon websites, it's real, sorry.
[01:38:23.029 --> 01:38:26.231]  But you know, you mentioned prior knowledge, and of course this is one of the components.
[01:38:26.271 --> 01:38:30.754]  We were actually reporting the 3.11 bombing in Madrid before Madrid.
[01:38:30.794 --> 01:38:37.238]  As you know, my former webmaster, still the webmaster of JackBlood.net, SuperMarioAndroid, reads in many languages.
[01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:45.043]  He was reading the Spanish newspapers to find out about ETA, and saw that there was a massing of police, and thought, well hey, this doesn't look right.
[01:38:45.103 --> 01:38:45.944]  Something's wrong.
[01:38:46.204 --> 01:38:47.445]  And again, prior knowledge.
[01:38:47.485 --> 01:38:52.308]  So, look, this is what we have, the pundits, the screaming heads like Sean Insanity,
[01:38:52.908 --> 01:39:04.921]  Sean Vanity talking about are comparing these events, comparing London and New York to Madrid to establish some type of continuity to blame Alciada for this event.
[01:39:04.961 --> 01:39:07.704]  Well look, yeah, I agree with these people.
[01:39:07.744 --> 01:39:14.311]  The same people that did New York and the same people that did Madrid are the same people that did London and another component of this is of course prior knowledge.
[01:39:15.942 --> 01:39:23.989]  Well, you're absolutely right, and it's a smokescreen on a larger level for their entire agenda across the planet.
[01:39:24.009 --> 01:39:34.698]  The imperial's agenda, the Anglo-American establishment's agenda, was stalling on every front, Jack, and I don't think this is going to give them the boost they need to keep it rolling.
[01:39:34.718 --> 01:39:35.218]  Well, I don't know.
[01:39:35.238 --> 01:39:47.770]  I mean, the image is plastered all over the print media, all over the televised media of Maine citizens mixed with militarized police with German shepherds and M-16s guarding both the train stations in New York.
[01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:49.151]  You know, that's a good point you just brought up.
[01:39:49.231 --> 01:39:51.493]  Germans, German shepherds... A lot of them are begging for it!
[01:39:51.693 --> 01:40:00.135]  German Shepherds, menacing small children with a guy with a frown on his face, with a machine gun on the bus and the train, but the borders are wide open.
[01:40:00.155 --> 01:40:05.256]  And three days ago, Jack, New York Times, Washington Post, we're getting rid of posse commentatas.
[01:40:05.296 --> 01:40:06.716]  We're going to have trips on the streets.
[01:40:07.016 --> 01:40:09.217]  We're going to have FBI searching you at the shopping malls.
[01:40:09.237 --> 01:40:12.117]  We saw that in New York, of course, when we were up there for the conventions.
[01:40:12.157 --> 01:40:16.378]  Look, people, and then there are the interviews, along with all these images and all this rhetoric.
[01:40:16.918 --> 01:40:19.219]  People feel better having protection, Alex.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.620]  That's, of course, what we pay for.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.881]  We're paying tributes.
[01:40:22.061 --> 01:40:25.203]  We're giving protection money to the New World Order Mafia.
[01:40:25.243 --> 01:40:29.185]  This was a message to us, making us an offer that we can't refuse.
[01:40:29.525 --> 01:40:30.366]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:40:30.386 --> 01:40:34.528]  And they're also on the news going, we're sorry we can't search all of you in America.
[01:40:34.848 --> 01:40:36.929]  We know you want to be searched, all of you in London.
[01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:39.050]  We're going to try to search all of you.
[01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:41.512]  We're going to try to check all your papers.
[01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.934]  Meanwhile, they're introducing the ID card for the seventh time.
[01:40:44.974 --> 01:40:45.594]  The Brits are
[01:40:46.014 --> 01:40:47.256]  Are threatening to riot.
[01:40:47.296 --> 01:40:51.501]  I mean, mainstream middle class people, folks who want out of Iraq.
[01:40:51.521 --> 01:40:54.585]  They're demanding to get out of Iraq here domestically and in England.
[01:40:54.925 --> 01:40:57.328]  It's just so transparent, Jack.
[01:40:57.368 --> 01:41:00.973]  Meanwhile, Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[01:41:01.073 --> 01:41:02.194]  Mainstream news!
[01:41:02.374 --> 01:41:04.577]  But we gotta have German Shepherds and M-16s pointed at us!
[01:41:05.558 --> 01:41:17.109]  Well, look, another part of the spin and the rhetoric, and this is what Chris Matthews was saying last night, history proves that in a case of a civil emergency, the people get behind their leaders domestically.
[01:41:17.129 --> 01:41:19.231]  Yeah, they're telling us the people get behind their leaders!
[01:41:19.331 --> 01:41:25.096]  Of course, if they don't, they'll be vilified as being soft on terror or possibly one of the evildoers.
[01:41:25.236 --> 01:41:33.543]  Well, look, I remember Michael Savage two years ago going, you just wait till there's another attack and then all of you are going to see because it's going to be your fault and we're going to blame you for it.
[01:41:33.563 --> 01:41:36.886]  And see, now we need Patriot Act 2 to be fully expanded.
[01:41:37.146 --> 01:41:40.349]  Now we need CAFTA, the North American Security Perimeter.
[01:41:40.849 --> 01:41:44.953]  Now we need a guy tough on terrorists like Alberto in the Supreme Court.
[01:41:45.333 --> 01:41:47.175]  Now we need all of this.
[01:41:47.455 --> 01:41:57.928]  You know, here's another good point, is that if you look at, if you compare America to the United Kingdom right now, to Britain, you'll see the exact same things going on, the exact same anti-terror legislation.
[01:41:57.948 --> 01:42:01.793]  By the way, I got a note from Joan Vion, who's covering the G8 up in Scotland.
[01:42:02.093 --> 01:42:05.998]  As we speak, they're signing some anti-terror declaration, but the point is this.
[01:42:06.218 --> 01:42:11.043]  We've got liberal leaders, of course, the Labour Party, headed up by Blair, in England.
[01:42:11.063 --> 01:42:21.052]  We've got the quote-unquote phony conservatives here in the United States, yet we have the exact same things happening, the exact same legislation, and the exact same conditioning of the people.
[01:42:21.172 --> 01:42:25.756]  The exact same cameras and microphones, all of it.
[01:42:25.956 --> 01:42:26.397]  Listen to this.
[01:42:26.437 --> 01:42:28.759]  They're disproving the phony left-right paradigm.
[01:42:29.679 --> 01:42:31.521]  And you know, this is supposedly a G8.
[01:42:31.561 --> 01:42:36.846]  They got like 20 people in this picture with Blair, you know, right in the middle, letting us know where the power comes from.
[01:42:36.886 --> 01:42:40.589]  Did you notice Bush standing to one side and Chirac standing to the other?
[01:42:40.649 --> 01:42:44.172]  I mean, that pretty much shows you where the Illuminati power structure lives.
[01:42:44.472 --> 01:42:46.134]  Britain, France, and America.
[01:42:46.494 --> 01:42:48.497]  Absolutely, and it's a pyramidal structure.
[01:42:48.537 --> 01:42:50.379]  If you look at this photo, everybody's standing.
[01:42:50.819 --> 01:42:51.320]  But here it is.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:53.742]  G8 leaders vow victory against terrorism.
[01:42:54.043 --> 01:43:02.893]  World leaders rallied behind President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday in resolving to defeat terrorists after a series of deadly subway and bus attacks.
[01:43:03.293 --> 01:43:05.436]  And they promised on Friday, which they are now doing,
[01:43:05.816 --> 01:43:15.662]  To sign a unanimous declaration to vow to rout out and defeat terrorism, but of course it's this Goldstein, foggy creature who can never be defeated.
[01:43:15.702 --> 01:43:17.783]  The eternal boogeyman, the eternal enemy.
[01:43:17.943 --> 01:43:19.584]  I want to go back to Sean Vanity.
[01:43:20.524 --> 01:43:24.987]  I couldn't believe my ears last night as, of course, you know, here's the usual connections.
[01:43:25.147 --> 01:43:31.671]  The London bombing, we've got a message on a message board that it was some unknown group no one's ever heard of from Al-Qaeda before.
[01:43:32.071 --> 01:43:34.033]  It's the secret Al-Qaeda of Europe.
[01:43:34.133 --> 01:43:40.578]  Instantly, even if that was true, instantly they're making the connections between Iraq and Al-Qaeda and these bombings.
[01:43:40.598 --> 01:43:41.860]  We've got to get behind the war in Iraq.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:46.263]  But this is something that Hannity said that just, my jaw dropped, though I should have expected it.
[01:43:46.604 --> 01:43:53.770]  Hannity takes this particular news story, the London bombings, and starts making the case of why we need to start torturing people.
[01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:54.951]  Why torture is good.
[01:43:55.754 --> 01:43:59.016]  Well, right after 9-11, Bush and everybody promoted torture in Rumsfeld.
[01:43:59.036 --> 01:44:01.257]  Then we see the images and they go, oh, we didn't do that.
[01:44:01.557 --> 01:44:08.580]  And then they burn Patsy's, who were ordered to do it, when we have Alberto Gonzalez's own memo saying they can torture people to death.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.822]  And then, exactly, they're right back promoting torture.
[01:44:12.382 --> 01:44:12.543]  Yeah.
[01:44:13.003 --> 01:44:14.005]  I mean, this is so sick.
[01:44:14.045 --> 01:44:21.556]  Meanwhile, endless videos of charging old Al-Qaeda training videos when our government actually paid for those training camps.
[01:44:21.897 --> 01:44:23.199]  You know, they did it.
[01:44:23.279 --> 01:44:23.539]  See?
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.183]  Here's images of them training four years ago.
[01:44:26.444 --> 01:44:27.966]  They're going to get you any minute.
[01:44:28.186 --> 01:44:42.334]  Yeah, and then you've got the MSNBC newspaper saying that not only do we need national ID cards in England, but we need them here, and of course this brings up to light... Meanwhile, Jeff, they've already passed them, but now they've got to convince us why we need to accept them!
[01:44:42.675 --> 01:44:54.982]  This also kind of brings up a point as to why target the London subways, because targeting transportation is going to make it easier to have some type of an internal passport traveling pass... Well, that's exactly what I'm told.
[01:44:55.162 --> 01:44:56.226]  That's what's set on this broadcast.
[01:44:56.246 --> 01:44:58.454]  That's what's in the REAL ID Act that they passed.
[01:44:58.474 --> 01:44:59.196]  And again, folks...
[01:45:00.049 --> 01:45:08.094]  Every place they attack, anywhere in the world, then they put troops and militarized police in those areas, and again, I'll say it again, it's a complete fraud.
[01:45:08.134 --> 01:45:15.458]  The Border Patrol is smaller than four years ago, and this whole thing is a complete, total joke.
[01:45:16.039 --> 01:45:22.382]  Now, you think, Alex, that there's been a big problem trying to get people to go into the military now?
[01:45:22.422 --> 01:45:24.644]  We know recruitment numbers are way, way down.
[01:45:24.684 --> 01:45:26.745]  You think this is going to get them back up to their bar?
[01:45:27.863 --> 01:45:30.285]  Jack, what you first said when you came on is what I've been saying all day.
[01:45:30.345 --> 01:45:31.405]  This is a trial balloon.
[01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:36.988]  This, 40 people dead, and they're saying 37 or 42, we don't know.
[01:45:37.008 --> 01:45:38.869]  It's still almost two days later.
[01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:45.513]  So, right now, I'm here to tell you folks, this is very small.
[01:45:45.573 --> 01:45:51.256]  This is a trial balloon for something much, much larger in Europe or in the United States.
[01:45:51.897 --> 01:46:00.623]  Well, unfortunately, as we're in this hail of rapid-fire info bullets coming at us, we of course need to keep our heads and remember what is important.
[01:46:00.643 --> 01:46:03.145]  Some of the things we're working on, we have to stay the course.
[01:46:03.185 --> 01:46:04.106]  We've got CAFTA.
[01:46:04.306 --> 01:46:07.468]  We've got the Patriot Act being renewed in Congress as we speak.
[01:46:07.688 --> 01:46:12.472]  We've got another vacancy in the Supreme Court now with Rehnquist reportedly stepping down.
[01:46:12.692 --> 01:46:15.294]  They're going to double-team us and put up Gonzales.
[01:46:15.334 --> 01:46:18.936]  I don't know if they can find anybody worse than him, but I'm sure they'll make a good effort.
[01:46:18.996 --> 01:46:20.898]  So, of course, we've got to stay the course.
[01:46:21.118 --> 01:46:22.699]  That is really what we need to remember.
[01:46:22.899 --> 01:46:28.421]  They could be using Gonzales as a foil to bring in some lesser-known demon who will be anti-gun for a long time.
[01:46:28.561 --> 01:46:32.102]  I didn't think they'd ever find anybody worse than Ashcroft, but of course they did.
[01:46:32.923 --> 01:46:33.603]  Absolutely.
[01:46:34.103 --> 01:46:36.344]  You know, Jack, other things is CAFTA.
[01:46:36.424 --> 01:46:42.067]  It's set to pass the House, set to be on Bush's desk in the next few weeks, and it's going to be one-sided.
[01:46:42.707 --> 01:46:47.909]  Latin America isn't even going to sign on, but we'll still let all their goods pour in and merge our databases with them.
[01:46:48.809 --> 01:46:53.010]  Well, it did pass the Senate, which didn't surprise me, but it was a pretty slim margin.
[01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:57.192]  It was 55 to 45, so there were 45 people that had voted against it.
[01:46:57.212 --> 01:47:01.993]  And now, Jack, we're not talking anymore about Karl Rove in the grand jury.
[01:47:02.013 --> 01:47:02.794]  He could be indicted.
[01:47:03.034 --> 01:47:05.515]  We're not talking about the land grabbing by the Supreme Court.
[01:47:05.755 --> 01:47:07.215]  We're not talking about new freedom.
[01:47:07.455 --> 01:47:08.736]  We're not talking about any of that.
[01:47:08.816 --> 01:47:09.996]  Nice little operation here.
[01:47:10.016 --> 01:47:11.016]  Let's take a call.
[01:47:11.597 --> 01:47:12.357]  Let's talk to Ron.
[01:47:12.397 --> 01:47:13.577]  We've got to go quick with these calls.
[01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:14.938]  Ron and New York are on the air.
[01:47:14.998 --> 01:47:15.338]  Go ahead.
[01:47:15.778 --> 01:47:27.980]  Hi Alex, obviously you must have been watching Fox News because the propaganda there is coming out hot and fast about how we need to expand the Patriot Act, give up more freedom, and have 9 million cameras inserted up our noses.
[01:47:28.758 --> 01:47:35.740]  Oddly enough, in England, in London in particular, there probably are about nine million cameras, and I want to make you a gentleman's wager.
[01:47:36.501 --> 01:47:42.362]  I bet you, in fact, that they will never retrieve an image of the guilty parties that planted or exploded those bombs.
[01:47:42.382 --> 01:47:45.764]  Well, it'll take them a few weeks to cut it out and make false videos.
[01:47:46.624 --> 01:47:47.524]  I don't think they will.
[01:47:47.804 --> 01:47:49.745]  I honestly think they probably won't.
[01:47:50.125 --> 01:47:52.046]  And yesterday, I'd like to say something.
[01:47:52.066 --> 01:47:53.526]  Yesterday you said they'll get a Patsy.
[01:47:54.026 --> 01:47:54.546]  You know what?
[01:47:54.806 --> 01:47:56.407]  I think they're going to change their approach.
[01:47:57.208 --> 01:48:01.294]  Because patsies can sometimes have unintended problematic consequences.
[01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:05.360]  What they'll do, and they could do this too, because many people are foolish enough.
[01:48:06.019 --> 01:48:22.326]  They will make strong inferences and innuendos that it's a particular group, and that will be satisfactory enough without the complication of a Patsy with... And then just set the precedent to have these, uh, well they've never had one single conviction of anybody, uh, that they arrested, you know, Zacharias Michaud, and he's saying I'm a Patsy.
[01:48:22.506 --> 01:48:23.546]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[01:48:23.987 --> 01:48:25.087]  Uh, let's take another call.
[01:48:25.107 --> 01:48:27.068]  Let's talk to William in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:27.108 --> 01:48:27.868]  William, go ahead.
[01:48:28.468 --> 01:48:34.411]  Yeah, Alex, um, um, I don't know if you're aware of this, but if you do a Google search on the internet,
[01:48:35.293 --> 01:48:39.477]  And type in Skull and Bones, that the first item that comes up is George Bush.
[01:48:40.558 --> 01:48:45.822]  It'll talk about how George Bush was a member of the Skull and Bones drinking club, William.
[01:48:46.162 --> 01:48:51.047]  I've made two films about it, one called Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and the other called Martial Law.
[01:48:52.488 --> 01:49:01.996]  Okay, also if you do a search on the Grand Lodge Freemasonry, you can get some useful information
[01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:07.011]  Uh, Skull and Bones, you got the Truly Society.
[01:49:07.391 --> 01:49:11.114]  Sir, we have massive sections on InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[01:49:11.154 --> 01:49:12.114]  Oh yes, very informative.
[01:49:12.294 --> 01:49:12.714]  Yes sir.
[01:49:13.115 --> 01:49:13.795]  Oh good, so you knew.
[01:49:13.915 --> 01:49:15.636]  You were just telling me that Bush was part of Skull and Bones.
[01:49:15.736 --> 01:49:20.859]  Well see, I don't have access to the internet, so I have to go, I usually go to the library to look up this stuff, so.
[01:49:20.879 --> 01:49:22.420]  Well I'm glad you're involved, sir.
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:23.080]  Any other comments?
[01:49:23.881 --> 01:49:27.303]  No sir, the last video tape I got of yours was 9-1-1.
[01:49:27.343 --> 01:49:29.364]  Road to Tyranny.
[01:49:29.644 --> 01:49:29.884]  Yes.
[01:49:30.785 --> 01:49:31.125]  Excellent.
[01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:32.170]  Well, thank you.
[01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.131]  Thank you for your support.
[01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:34.412]  You make the broadcast possible.
[01:49:34.692 --> 01:49:34.892]  All right.
[01:49:34.912 --> 01:49:35.372]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:35.592 --> 01:49:35.972]  Thank you.
[01:49:36.032 --> 01:49:39.234]  And folks, you should get 9-11 Road to Journey, not just Martial Law.
[01:49:39.274 --> 01:49:40.535]  These are both my best works.
[01:49:40.975 --> 01:49:41.615]  You need to have them.
[01:49:41.635 --> 01:49:44.137]  PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowars.com to order online.
[01:49:44.517 --> 01:49:45.517]  We'll be back with Jack Blood.
[01:49:45.537 --> 01:49:48.379]  I want to keep Jack a little bit into the next hour or two if he can do that.
[01:49:48.739 --> 01:49:51.301]  We've got a guest expert on Africa coming on as well.
[01:49:51.341 --> 01:49:52.941]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.582 --> 01:49:57.444]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.178 --> 01:49:59.459]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:05.401]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.682 --> 01:50:10.924]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.244 --> 01:50:15.346]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.546 --> 01:50:19.329]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:24.213]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.333 --> 01:50:30.577]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.617 --> 01:50:32.439]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:32.919 --> 01:50:35.021]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[01:50:35.102 --> 01:50:38.145]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:38.225 --> 01:50:41.508]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:42.249 --> 01:50:46.633]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:50:46.733 --> 01:50:48.716]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:50.517]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:50.537 --> 01:50:52.760]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:55.277 --> 01:51:06.553]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:06.773 --> 01:51:10.258]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:51:10.458 --> 01:51:10.938]  We're good to go!
[01:51:31.650 --> 01:51:38.597]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:51:38.797 --> 01:51:41.019]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.099 --> 01:51:44.062]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:44.102 --> 01:51:45.343]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:53.764 --> 01:52:00.646]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:52:01.186 --> 01:52:06.587]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:52:07.007 --> 01:52:17.010]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:19.510]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:52:19.890 --> 01:52:22.931]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:52:23.391 --> 01:52:24.591]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:52:24.711 --> 01:52:32.173]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:52:32.453 --> 01:52:34.193]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:52:34.513 --> 01:52:46.276]  You'll find Non-X gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:52:46.776 --> 01:52:51.117]  Non-X nail gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:00.582]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:53:02.343 --> 01:53:02.723]  We're here.
[01:53:02.823 --> 01:53:05.324]  By the way, we have a very timely guest coming on Monday.
[01:53:06.265 --> 01:53:06.825]  David Icke.
[01:53:06.925 --> 01:53:07.565]  Two hours.
[01:53:08.326 --> 01:53:09.446]  Talk about the G8.
[01:53:09.626 --> 01:53:10.867]  And this was set up a week ago.
[01:53:10.887 --> 01:53:13.128]  And he, of course, lives in England.
[01:53:13.148 --> 01:53:14.029]  A very interesting fellow.
[01:53:14.049 --> 01:53:17.330]  I don't agree with all of his views, but it's always interesting with David Icke.
[01:53:17.370 --> 01:53:18.311]  You want him, you've got him.
[01:53:19.171 --> 01:53:20.272]  Two hours on Monday.
[01:53:21.351 --> 01:53:23.032]  We'll be talking about this issue, of course.
[01:53:23.813 --> 01:53:25.734]  Loaded phone lines perpetually throughout the broadcast.
[01:53:25.754 --> 01:53:26.995]  I want to go to some more of those calls.
[01:53:28.115 --> 01:53:37.101]  Jack, the points that some of the last callers were bringing up predominantly, talking about Ron and New York, I mean, they really are just pouring on the propaganda.
[01:53:37.181 --> 01:53:38.122]  And Bush and Blair,
[01:53:39.443 --> 01:53:45.386]  Look like a cat who's been caught eating the canary, you know, with the proverbial feathers sticking out of their mouth.
[01:53:45.406 --> 01:53:49.468]  They look so... I mean, not just the evidence, the motive, they look so guilty.
[01:53:49.488 --> 01:53:50.169]  Your gut!
[01:53:50.549 --> 01:53:51.709]  I mean, they are just criminals.
[01:53:51.749 --> 01:53:52.070]  Go ahead.
[01:53:52.650 --> 01:53:59.413]  Glee, uh, when he was forced to face reporters, just a unit, reminded me when he was about to announce the, uh, Iraq War.
[01:53:59.453 --> 01:54:03.736]  He was on TV, and you know, the pool cameras were catching him before he actually went on the air.
[01:54:03.976 --> 01:54:05.436]  And he was laughing hysterically.
[01:54:05.456 --> 01:54:08.378]  He had a case of the giggles before he's about to announce
[01:54:08.718 --> 01:54:12.721]  Shock and awe, which by the way, there is a shock and awe prophecy which ties right into that.
[01:54:13.042 --> 01:54:16.384]  Same thing when he was asked a question at a press conference about two weeks ago.
[01:54:16.645 --> 01:54:19.347]  This was aired on the Daily Show, a pretty funny clip of this.
[01:54:19.387 --> 01:54:23.290]  When he's asked about all the deaths in Iraq, he's laughing hysterically!
[01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:23.871]  Alex?
[01:54:24.571 --> 01:54:29.034]  I mean, this is a guy that used to torture small animals when he was a little kid.
[01:54:29.634 --> 01:54:31.556]  He is a serious psychopath.
[01:54:32.036 --> 01:54:35.478]  And though he doesn't plan these things, he's pretty low down the food chain.
[01:54:35.678 --> 01:54:37.360]  Less than middle management, I would say.
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:39.581]  But he loves this kind of stuff.
[01:54:39.621 --> 01:54:41.082]  He loves seeing people die.
[01:54:41.502 --> 01:54:44.464]  And I don't think I'm going too far off the branch to really say that.
[01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:45.605]  You know what it reminds me of?
[01:54:45.625 --> 01:54:48.327]  The reaction to this reminds me of a story that just came in from Yahoo.
[01:54:49.247 --> 01:54:51.689]  450 sheep jumped to their deaths in Turkey.
[01:54:51.969 --> 01:55:00.435]  The first one jumped to its death and then the stunned Turkish sheep shepherds just watched as 450 others just followed it right over the cliff.
[01:55:01.976 --> 01:55:04.137]  Yep, that's how a lot of people are behaving.
[01:55:04.538 --> 01:55:07.720]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:09.281]  Alex in North Carolina.
[01:55:09.801 --> 01:55:10.562]  Alex, go ahead.
[01:55:10.582 --> 01:55:13.163]  Hi, I just wanted to talk about a couple of local things.
[01:55:13.443 --> 01:55:15.325]  First, the new Freedom Initiative.
[01:55:15.405 --> 01:55:16.325]  I have children.
[01:55:16.345 --> 01:55:17.186]  One is in school.
[01:55:18.033 --> 01:55:22.016]  And I wrote to the school principal and also the school board.
[01:55:22.576 --> 01:55:24.778]  I wrote them polite letters that weren't accusatory.
[01:55:24.818 --> 01:55:26.459]  I just asked them if they knew about it.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.445]  And if they had it, I would be happy to give them either a printed copy or direct them to where they could get it.
[01:55:34.605 --> 01:55:37.527]  If they had any information on what their policy was toward it, let me know.
[01:55:38.568 --> 01:55:40.970]  And in all cases, they simply just ignore me.
[01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:42.231]  They're like, I don't exist.
[01:55:43.275 --> 01:55:48.658]  I did get an answer from my state representative and he said he hadn't heard about it and would look into it.
[01:55:48.678 --> 01:55:52.400]  Yeah, it's a federal law passed for forced psychological testing and forced drugging.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:54.281]  They're trying to get it passed at the state level.
[01:55:54.321 --> 01:55:55.121]  They have it in Illinois.
[01:55:55.141 --> 01:55:56.442]  We narrowly defeated it in Texas.
[01:55:56.842 --> 01:55:57.863]  And then, yeah, you get it.
[01:55:58.263 --> 01:56:02.446]  You go, hey, we don't want national ID cards, and the Congress will go, what national ID cards?
[01:56:02.866 --> 01:56:03.927]  Even though they just passed it.
[01:56:04.327 --> 01:56:06.208]  Or, you know, we're against globalization.
[01:56:06.268 --> 01:56:07.249]  What globalization?
[01:56:07.269 --> 01:56:08.250]  You know, it doesn't exist.
[01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:09.631]  This is a tactic.
[01:56:09.731 --> 01:56:10.431]  Jack comments.
[01:56:28.183 --> 01:56:28.484]  Yeah, and those...
[01:56:34.508 --> 01:56:36.149]  Put their hooves, the fire is right.
[01:56:36.209 --> 01:56:48.494]  No, I mean, it was a listener who was scanning legislation three or four months ago and found the thing, the bill to put transponders in 2006 in all inspection stickers to start taxing us as we drive down the road.
[01:56:48.534 --> 01:56:49.495]  It almost passed.
[01:56:49.555 --> 01:56:50.595]  We barely defeated it.
[01:56:50.875 --> 01:56:52.136]  It was a serious bill.
[01:56:52.576 --> 01:56:57.698]  The toll readers have already been put up five years ago.
[01:56:57.818 --> 01:57:00.159]  So folks, I mean, it's that close.
[01:57:00.679 --> 01:57:02.880]  We need you to go out and research.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:03.821]  We can't do it all.
[01:57:04.401 --> 01:57:06.882]  Yeah, I think Austin is really a model for people to follow.
[01:57:06.942 --> 01:57:11.763]  I'm proud to say, Alex, and we've just recently defeated the Checkpoints here with Texans against Checkpoints.
[01:57:12.264 --> 01:57:17.265]  I mean, we're really on a roll down here, and I don't want to forget the momentum that we have now because of these London bombings.
[01:57:17.405 --> 01:57:23.067]  Well, all the great patriots are moving to Austin, and we are probably the capital of the fight against the New World Order.
[01:57:23.087 --> 01:57:24.408]  Even national TV has said that.
[01:57:24.768 --> 01:57:29.029]  That's why I think we're a prime target for the globalists, unfortunately, to launch an attack here.
[01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:30.830]  Alright, I said it.
[01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:31.950]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:57:33.627 --> 01:57:38.252]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.292 --> 01:57:38.592]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.612 --> 01:57:39.132]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.516 --> 01:57:54.596]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.256 --> 01:57:56.117]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.857 --> 01:57:57.717]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.417 --> 01:58:02.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.598 --> 01:58:06.739]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.219 --> 01:58:10.439]  All right, folks.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:15.700]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.561]  We've got an expert.
[01:58:16.581 --> 01:58:18.121]  He lived in Africa, born in Africa.
[01:58:19.201 --> 01:58:29.327]  We'll be discussing how they passed terrorism laws back in the early fifties, all the anti-terror laws, and how that really is one of the modern models of what we're facing, how it ties into London.
[01:58:30.948 --> 01:58:37.172]  Of course, Jack Blood is joining us right now, jackblood.com, and his broadcast starts immediately after this one ends.
[01:58:37.842 --> 01:58:40.885]  And I always appreciate Jack's great analysis and the work he does.
[01:58:41.945 --> 01:58:48.170]  Jack, let's just take a few final calls in this segment, then I'll let you get back to preparing for your own broadcast.
[01:58:48.691 --> 01:58:51.553]  But I think what came up in the last segment about new freedom is important.
[01:58:52.214 --> 01:58:53.715]  We've got to stay focused on the new freedom.
[01:58:54.135 --> 01:58:57.618]  Talk about an Orwellian term for psychological testing and drugging by the government.
[01:58:58.479 --> 01:59:01.461]  We've got to stay focused on CAFTA, set to pass the House.
[01:59:01.581 --> 01:59:02.442]  Big fight going on.
[01:59:03.726 --> 01:59:09.671]  These Supreme Court nominations now, it's coming out that Rehnquist will probably announce his resignation here in the next few weeks.
[01:59:10.532 --> 01:59:11.452]  Not just O'Connor.
[01:59:12.373 --> 01:59:13.234]  Sandra Day O'Connor.
[01:59:14.275 --> 01:59:17.838]  We have got just all of these issues we're facing.
[01:59:17.878 --> 01:59:23.883]  The war in Iraq, the fraud, and the looming larger events of government-sponsored terror.
[01:59:24.803 --> 01:59:27.726]  Let's go ahead and go to Jason in Texas.
[01:59:27.786 --> 01:59:28.607]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:59:28.647 --> 01:59:28.947]  Go ahead.
[01:59:29.924 --> 01:59:35.829]  Hey Alex, I'm a commercial pilot, and there's a lot of things going on in the industry, especially with security.
[01:59:35.909 --> 01:59:37.270]  They're really concerning me.
[01:59:38.772 --> 01:59:53.664]  There's been some big moves, which thankfully AOPA, which I'm a member of, which supports small aircraft, there's been some moves to limit freedom of travel of small aircraft due to this threat of terrorism.
[01:59:53.824 --> 01:59:54.145]  Yeah, I know.
[01:59:54.265 --> 01:59:58.028]  Everything is about regulating and controlling and restricting our mobility.
[01:59:59.085 --> 01:59:59.365]  Yeah.
[01:59:59.746 --> 02:00:02.968]  Well, it really bothers me because it's completely stupid.
[02:00:02.988 --> 02:00:05.351]  Specifically, what are they trying to do right now?
[02:00:05.371 --> 02:00:06.451]  I want to get a comment from Jack.
[02:00:07.552 --> 02:00:09.934]  Well, they've been putting up all these posters.
[02:00:10.015 --> 02:00:12.677]  Keep your eyes out for suspicious activity.
[02:00:12.717 --> 02:00:16.100]  Those are Nazi posters from the World War II era, by the way.
[02:00:17.608 --> 02:00:17.948]  They are.
[02:00:19.929 --> 02:00:28.314]  They really are recycling classical, that style, Art Deco.
[02:00:28.734 --> 02:00:31.736]  Literally, these are Art Deco style posters saying, watch your neighbors.
[02:00:31.756 --> 02:00:33.797]  Go ahead.
[02:00:33.937 --> 02:00:39.880]  Another thing that they've done is they've put out these huge restricted air spaces where if you fly into them,
[02:00:41.448 --> 02:00:50.273]  All hell breaks loose, and around the President, when he's flying, there's a ten nautical mile bubble around him, front and back, side to side.
[02:00:51.153 --> 02:00:56.196]  And, you know, if you think about it, ten nautical miles is a huge amount in the air.
[02:00:56.276 --> 02:00:58.838]  No, every time, this has happened with Clinton, but now it's worse.
[02:00:58.898 --> 02:01:04.381]  When the Emperor comes into a city, I mean, air traffic just shuts down.
[02:01:04.461 --> 02:01:10.104]  All the planes sit there, other planes have to wait in the air until he lands, until he gets off, sometimes two hours.
[02:01:11.115 --> 02:01:11.355]  Yeah.
[02:01:11.655 --> 02:01:13.696]  They have to redirect larger aircraft.
[02:01:13.996 --> 02:01:14.996]  Jack, comments on this?
[02:01:15.236 --> 02:01:18.497]  Well, of course, you know, we're getting groped for air travel.
[02:01:18.517 --> 02:01:20.438]  They've got Caps 2, which has been defeated.
[02:01:20.498 --> 02:01:24.219]  Of course, now the preferred customer list, which will... Yeah, they just changed the name.
[02:01:24.239 --> 02:01:29.840]  ...which where you could sign up and go ahead and take an iris scanner or a thumb scanner and jump in line in front of everybody else.
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:33.341]  But they needed to get the buses and the trains online.
[02:01:33.361 --> 02:01:39.063]  And that's what part of the fallout, the component of this bombing, will, of course, create.
[02:01:39.083 --> 02:01:39.883]  Yeah, and then they...
[02:01:40.703 --> 02:01:46.866]  Because if you follow the patterns of serial killers, one of the things that we saw on 9-11 were the put options on the airlines.
[02:01:46.906 --> 02:01:55.231]  And I've got to tell you, investors that saw this coming, that had prior knowledge to this event in London, there was a nice dip, a nice spike on the stock market all over the world.
[02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:55.971]  No, no, that's been shown.
[02:01:55.991 --> 02:01:56.972]  That's been shown now.
[02:01:57.212 --> 02:01:59.913]  And the airlines are all down about 3-4 points, Alex.
[02:01:59.933 --> 02:02:03.515]  So I'd like to see if there was any put options for yesterday's bombing.
[02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:10.962]  Well, actually, Jack, I have an article here on the stack I was going to try to get to later, along with some emails, but we're just so much to cover where it does show that.
[02:02:11.342 --> 02:02:13.802]  Sir, I really appreciate your call, Jason.
[02:02:13.842 --> 02:02:14.583]  Sorry we're out of time.
[02:02:14.903 --> 02:02:17.163]  Jack Blood, thank you for coming out with us.

[02:02:22.705 --> 02:02:25.865]  And, of course, it's always a privilege and an honor to follow you every day, Alex.
[02:02:26.065 --> 02:02:27.506]  Not an easy shoes to fill there.

[02:05:56.868 --> 02:05:57.729]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:02.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.633 --> 02:06:06.756]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.518 --> 02:06:17.425]  Alright, I know we've had a lot of phone lines.
[02:06:19.306 --> 02:06:28.872]  People out there want to talk about the bombings yesterday, about the police state, about Kappa passing the Senate in the House right now.
[02:06:28.892 --> 02:06:34.496]  We're going to take calls throughout the next 52 minutes that we've got left in this Friday broadcast.
[02:06:35.957 --> 02:06:38.879]  I had this guest set up before this happened.
[02:06:40.491 --> 02:06:54.515]  Because he grew up in Zimbabwe, which of course is formerly Rhodesia, and he talks and writes about what he calls British-style terror, where these wars, these wars on drugs, wars on terror, is really a British invention.
[02:06:54.535 --> 02:06:57.036]  They're masters of the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:06:58.776 --> 02:07:05.958]  And how the model brought forward in the 50s and 60s in Africa of anti-terror laws even called that
[02:07:06.678 --> 02:07:35.315]  were used and then every time they passed the laws the terror got worse of course because the government's financing and controlling it to bring in control against the good people the general public and how the globalists have wrecked Africa by design and of course with the G8 going on and Live Aid and just all of this going on it's very timely very important and you know I've forgotten the last two hours you probably had ten different calls from London and England yesterday
[02:07:36.883 --> 02:07:40.426]  If you're listening from England, when you hear a caller hang up, it's your chance to call in.
[02:07:40.466 --> 02:07:41.626]  We'll go to the head of the line and let you.
[02:07:41.646 --> 02:07:44.308]  We've got to limit each caller to about 60 seconds, though.
[02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:50.473]  You can come on and talk about what the response is in London, you know, how you're dealing with it.
[02:07:50.493 --> 02:07:52.194]  We had an amazing broadcast yesterday.
[02:07:52.954 --> 02:07:57.157]  But, Robbie, I wish we had more time, but, you know, these attacks took place.
[02:07:57.177 --> 02:08:05.383]  But having you on fits perfectly in with what we discussed a few days before yesterday.
[02:08:06.884 --> 02:08:15.371]  I mean, exactly what you were talking about, the model they used in Africa, the British used in Africa being used in the Western world to bring in that same type of system.
[02:08:15.811 --> 02:08:16.091]  Robbie?
[02:08:16.531 --> 02:08:17.612]  Yeah, well, there's no question.
[02:08:17.652 --> 02:08:24.137]  I mean, today you had an agreement by the G8 on aid to Africa.
[02:08:24.618 --> 02:08:28.981]  It wasn't as much as some had hoped for, but it's $50 billion with strings attached.
[02:08:29.761 --> 02:08:31.483]  And the strings attached, obviously,
[02:08:32.413 --> 02:08:53.136]  are for African leaders to help in the the global war against terrorism which is kind of ironic because if you look at the photograph of the G8 members they are standing with another nine members of the African delegation and I managed to identify eight of the nine as former terrorists
[02:08:54.230 --> 02:09:07.560]  So, what you have is you're going to have these African countries, in order to get Western aid, they're going to have to implement, and many of them have, by the way, Nigeria has a terrorism law in place.
[02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:19.989]  Robert Mugabe, the noted terrorist of many years ago, who massacred 30,000 of his political opposition, has introduced terrorism legislation.
[02:09:21.029 --> 02:09:21.910]  Thabo Mbiki,
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:44.175]  who was part and parcel of the rise of Spear of the Nation with Nelson Mandela, the ANC wing, has also, as a matter of fact, under Thabo Mbiki, they've introduced terrorism legislation that's even more draconian than the terrorism legislation that was imposed by the former South African government.
[02:09:45.076 --> 02:09:50.420]  And so, yeah, we can say, and George Bush obviously has made the point on many occasions,
[02:09:51.471 --> 02:10:11.908]  That in order for Africa to get aid, there are going to be strings attached, and part of the strings attached are this help on this global war on terrorism, which pretty much all it does is it's the greatest boon to any government to fight a war on terrorism, because a terrorist
[02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:16.612]  Is anybody who opposes that official government policy?
[02:10:17.573 --> 02:10:24.959]  The War on Terror is just an umbrella for worldwide governmental despotism and classical tyranny.
[02:10:26.003 --> 02:10:43.532]  against the people and uh... you know Robbie you grew up in Rhodesia where the new world order the current model under Cecil Rhodes uh... was uh... literally developed and then you watched in the early sixties as they passed an anti-terrorism law and did the terrorism go away or did it increase?
[02:10:43.952 --> 02:10:50.736]  Well no it did obviously as soon as they banned the ANC because it was a communist organization
[02:10:52.097 --> 02:11:02.368]  That, in fact, was a catalyst that caused the ANC to grow and receive huge amounts of financing from the likes of the Soviet Union and Communist China.
[02:11:02.529 --> 02:11:08.696]  And by the way, I'm not defending apartheid folks, but then it's like either you're for Bush or you're for Saddam.
[02:11:08.756 --> 02:11:09.737]  No, they're both bad.
[02:11:10.445 --> 02:11:39.228]  I mean, it's admitted that Winnie Mandela bragged about it on TV, hanging necklaces around children's necks, tires with gasoline, burning their heads off, these black killers that the globalists always fun and controlled, that kill more blacks than any white ever thought about, then the controlled globalist media tells you that they're anti-corporate, you know, freedom fighters, when in reality they're having their strings pulled because the globalists want to make sure that Africa is in shambles, so no strong governments rise,
[02:11:39.528 --> 02:11:42.109]  So the globalists can continue to extract the resources.
[02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:44.350]  Is that a correct analysis, Robbie Noel?
[02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:45.030]  Well, sure.
[02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:51.973]  I mean, in the 60s and the 70s, there was a war against communism, especially here in the United States.
[02:11:52.673 --> 02:12:00.356]  The problem with the mainstream press at the time is they didn't view South Africa's war as a war against communism.
[02:12:00.616 --> 02:12:02.717]  They saw it as a racial conflict.
[02:12:04.798 --> 02:12:07.979]  It was never ever portrayed in the mainstream press
[02:12:09.049 --> 02:12:11.631]  as a South African fight against communism.
[02:12:11.831 --> 02:12:15.354]  It was a South African fight against the indigenous population.
[02:12:16.055 --> 02:12:28.104]  So they never ever saw what was actually transpiring and obviously Nelson Mandela became the poster child for the left's cause
[02:12:30.167 --> 02:12:37.555]  Well, it's like the current president of Iraq bombed school buses, and Mandela admittedly blew up school buses.
[02:12:38.055 --> 02:12:40.958]  I mean, do you have to blow up school buses to become a world leader?
[02:12:41.618 --> 02:12:53.130]  Well, in Mandela's case, he didn't have the wherewithal to fight on an intellectual level, so he resorted to the basis of where he was taught in
[02:12:54.011 --> 02:13:21.103]  in Moscow on guerrilla warfare in order to achieve his objective I mean Mandela at the Rivonia trial where he was convicted of treason and actually was sentenced to death they just reversed that just because of world pressure he was found in possession of thousands of rounds of well I should say thousands of Russian made landmines, hand grenades, plastic explosives
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:27.906]  Which he used to terrorize, by and large, his own people.
[02:13:28.326 --> 02:13:29.687]  Well, bottom line, exactly.
[02:13:29.787 --> 02:13:31.849]  Most of this was blacks fighting with blacks.
[02:13:31.889 --> 02:13:38.315]  The ANC was just one group of blacks literally slaughtering entire villages of other blacks, Zulus and others.
[02:13:38.635 --> 02:13:46.803]  But the average American just hears that it's evil white men slaving black people, when in reality, folks, again, not defending the policies of the white South African government, but here's the fact.
[02:13:47.879 --> 02:13:50.000]  And Robby knows more about this than I do.
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:50.881]  He lived in the area.
[02:13:51.481 --> 02:14:07.750]  But understand, whether it's Saddam Hussein, or Khlaboba Milosevic, or the leaders of white South Africa, anybody who's sovereign, good or bad, or ugly, anybody who's sovereign, who isn't under total globalist control, is going to be brought down by internal revolution.
[02:14:07.930 --> 02:14:11.753]  Whether it be right-wing, left-wing, Robby, is that a correct analysis?
[02:14:12.193 --> 02:14:14.094]  Well, you've got to understand,
[02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:18.113]  There wasn't a homogeneous white population in Southern Africa.
[02:14:18.313 --> 02:14:22.317]  They were divided between two ethnic groups, if you will, the Afrikaans and the English.
[02:14:22.577 --> 02:14:24.038]  And the Afrikaans, of course, are Dutch.
[02:14:24.498 --> 02:14:24.759]  Right.
[02:14:25.279 --> 02:14:29.923]  And by and large... So the whites have been busy for hundreds of years slaughtering each other, too.
[02:14:30.464 --> 02:14:30.904]  Oh, sure.
[02:14:30.964 --> 02:14:32.145]  Well, we had the Boer War.
[02:14:32.385 --> 02:14:37.370]  So it's a total tribal bedlam, blacks killing blacks, whites killing blacks, blacks killing whites.
[02:14:37.730 --> 02:14:42.434]  But under the current government that was there 20 years ago, that had been stopped, correct?
[02:14:43.783 --> 02:14:45.284]  Well, to an extent.
[02:14:45.624 --> 02:14:50.105]  Tribal warfare, because it was just a matter of separating the ethnic tribes.
[02:14:50.765 --> 02:14:51.946]  The Zulus and the Causas.
[02:14:52.106 --> 02:14:53.666]  Nelson Mandela was a Causa.
[02:14:53.686 --> 02:14:56.747]  The Zulus were headed by Chief Gadipo-Delezi.
[02:14:57.107 --> 02:14:59.388]  What about your parents in Africa?
[02:14:59.428 --> 02:15:00.728]  Were they connected to the British?
[02:15:01.289 --> 02:15:01.489]  Sure.
[02:15:02.529 --> 02:15:07.131]  I mean, everybody has an obvious lineage to the British on this one.
[02:15:07.511 --> 02:15:11.572]  But the thing that I would like to impart on people so they understand
[02:15:12.899 --> 02:15:20.522]  There was obviously a lot of English-speaking whites in South Africa that were opposed to the official government policy.
[02:15:22.443 --> 02:15:37.050]  In 1973, when P. W. Botha initially instituted the Terrorism Act of 1976, most people supported it because they were tired of the terrorist acts of the ANC.
[02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:42.152]  It wasn't until a few years later that it became apparent that in the government's eyes,
[02:15:42.981 --> 02:16:04.530]  A terrorist was anybody who opposed official government policy and what this effectively did is it shut down any opposition voices uh... to the current government and ultimately because those voices were shut down and because those voices were not heard because people were I mean in South Africa you could get arrested uh...
[02:16:06.898 --> 02:16:12.643]  Just by the mere thought that you were somehow connected with some terrorist organization.
[02:16:13.043 --> 02:16:16.646]  The police didn't have to have any proof beyond all reasonable doubt.
[02:16:17.066 --> 02:16:20.869]  They just had to think that you were connected with the terrorists.
[02:16:20.929 --> 02:16:24.892]  They had the right to lock you up for 90 days without a trial, without a lawyer, without a judge.
[02:16:24.912 --> 02:16:28.615]  And this chilling effect of free speech and freedom led to the destruction of your country.
[02:16:28.835 --> 02:16:33.419]  Well, sure, because ultimately what happens in situations like that, people pull in their horns.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:38.804]  I mean, you don't talk about politics in open.
[02:16:38.905 --> 02:16:44.450]  As a matter of fact, you're even hesitant to talk about politics within your own family, because you don't...
[02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:47.871]  That's how crazy it was, because you didn't know.
[02:16:48.051 --> 02:16:55.174]  You know, if someone in your family was supporting the government and thought somehow you were a threat, well, they'd make an anonymous phone call.
[02:16:55.254 --> 02:16:56.714]  And the next thing, off you went.
[02:16:57.114 --> 02:17:00.195]  And that's the atmosphere they're trying to set up here and in England.
[02:17:00.776 --> 02:17:04.037]  When you heard about the bombings yesterday morning, Robbie, what first popped in your head?
[02:17:05.797 --> 02:17:07.038]  Who stands to gain?
[02:17:08.038 --> 02:17:12.099]  It was like, remember in the 90s, and I mentioned this before, in the 90s,
[02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:24.590]  When the plane used to go down, we always used to think, oh, what a tragedy, but under Clinton and Ron Brown, when planes used to go down, we used to say, well, who was on the plane?
[02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:28.932]  Now when bombs go off, you ask yourself, well, who's going to benefit?
[02:17:30.492 --> 02:17:39.076]  And it's going to be the same old folks that are carrying out the terror, the Western governments, setting up a police state here, not to stop terrorism, but to take our freedom.
[02:17:39.696 --> 02:17:44.078]  We'll talk about the latest developments in London, Take Your Calls, and more on the other side.
[02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:46.738]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:46.818 --> 02:17:51.602]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:17:51.762 --> 02:17:59.569]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:17:59.829 --> 02:18:05.214]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:05.414 --> 02:18:12.400]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:18.022]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:18:18.282 --> 02:18:23.004]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:18:23.344 --> 02:18:30.927]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:18:31.287 --> 02:18:37.530]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:18:37.850 --> 02:18:41.372]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:41.712 --> 02:18:42.272]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:42.312 --> 02:18:43.993]  Hello, folks.
[02:18:44.053 --> 02:18:46.514]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:18:46.895 --> 02:18:52.637]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:18:52.897 --> 02:18:57.980]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:07.669]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:19:07.989 --> 02:19:12.934]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:19:13.274 --> 02:19:17.298]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:19:17.498 --> 02:19:22.183]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:19:22.603 --> 02:19:28.590]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:35.098]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:19:45.217 --> 02:19:47.740]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:57.609]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:19:58.529 --> 02:20:05.336]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:20:06.257 --> 02:20:07.678]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:07.918 --> 02:20:10.961]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[02:20:11.937 --> 02:20:20.463]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:45.678 --> 02:20:51.222]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:20:51.342 --> 02:20:52.403]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:20:52.523 --> 02:20:53.404]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:20:53.524 --> 02:20:56.366]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:20:56.546 --> 02:21:01.430]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:02.751]  Check out this new product.
[02:21:02.911 --> 02:21:05.813]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:21:06.193 --> 02:21:09.896]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:21:10.036 --> 02:21:10.216]  Look.
[02:21:10.396 --> 02:21:12.738]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[02:21:12.798 --> 02:21:17.621]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:21:17.881 --> 02:21:21.004]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[02:21:21.144 --> 02:21:26.528]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:21:26.648 --> 02:21:27.408]  Try No-BO.
[02:21:27.528 --> 02:21:28.509]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:32.532]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:21:32.752 --> 02:21:35.634]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.

[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:51.823]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.385 --> 02:21:58.347]  All over the world, communist countries,
[02:21:59.713 --> 02:22:01.854]  Supposed Capitalist Western Countries.
[02:22:01.934 --> 02:22:03.194]  Dictatorships in Africa.
[02:22:04.194 --> 02:22:07.195]  Weapons being sold to them by the US and England.
[02:22:08.835 --> 02:22:09.796]  Known Terrorists.
[02:22:09.856 --> 02:22:10.816]  Almost all of them.
[02:22:10.876 --> 02:22:11.836]  Admitted Terrorists.
[02:22:11.856 --> 02:22:13.897]  People who have actually bombed and killed innocent people.
[02:22:14.217 --> 02:22:17.518]  They're all being put in as the leaders and now they're going to fight terrorism!
[02:22:18.858 --> 02:22:19.999]  It is so transparent.
[02:22:20.019 --> 02:22:23.700]  We're going to go to Mike and Milton and Jamie and others here in just a few minutes.
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:27.941]  We'll get back more into the story with Robbie Noel who grew up in what is now Zimbabwe.
[02:22:27.981 --> 02:22:29.001]  Of course Rhodesia.
[02:22:30.411 --> 02:22:43.915]  But, Robbie, I really believe that this current bombing, and we were talking during the break, you said clearly this is for the G8, this has got globalist fingerprints on it, you can elaborate on that if you'd like, but clearly I think this is a trial balloon.
[02:22:44.335 --> 02:22:51.877]  Their whole agenda, their phony wars, their police state, their national ID cards, their CAFTA, all of it is in trouble.
[02:22:52.297 --> 02:22:55.558]  All over the world, the New World Orders program is stuck in the mud.
[02:22:55.578 --> 02:22:58.059]  It's like Hitler's Barbarossa in Russia.
[02:22:59.235 --> 02:23:02.836]  Got stuck up to its axles in the mud.
[02:23:02.876 --> 02:23:07.517]  This is some attempt to jumpstart their agenda and hit the moral high ground for their tyranny.
[02:23:08.298 --> 02:23:12.139]  But I think it's a trial balloon for bigger events in the Western world.
[02:23:12.179 --> 02:23:12.979]  What say ye?
[02:23:13.639 --> 02:23:14.880]  Well, I mean, there's no question.
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:22.842]  I mean, the smoke hadn't even cleared from London when Sensenbrenner came out yesterday and once again made a call for expanding the Patriot Act.
[02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:26.203]  So yeah, there's no question.
[02:23:26.383 --> 02:23:26.603]  I mean,
[02:23:27.501 --> 02:23:35.202]  There's nobody that's going to be opposed to fighting terrorism, which is kind of ironic, because terrorism is not anything other than a... it's a tactic.
[02:23:35.522 --> 02:23:37.603]  It's not a person, it's not a place, it's not a thing.
[02:23:37.703 --> 02:23:38.903]  It's a political tactic.
[02:23:39.823 --> 02:23:49.545]  So, the powers that be, there's no question, the globalists weren't achieving their objective prior to 9-11.
[02:23:49.565 --> 02:23:56.026]  9-11 put their agenda forefront and center, and they managed to achieve a lot, but it's gone a little wayward
[02:23:56.790 --> 02:24:01.133]  With the loss of support through the war in Iraq.
[02:24:01.814 --> 02:24:05.056]  So obviously they've got to continually stir the pot.
[02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:11.421]  And by the way, Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, they've all got globalist pundits from the left and the right on going.
[02:24:11.501 --> 02:24:11.781]  See?
[02:24:12.061 --> 02:24:13.082]  This proves we're right.
[02:24:13.142 --> 02:24:15.404]  We've got to stay the course with the war on terror.
[02:24:15.444 --> 02:24:16.905]  Two things, Robbie, then I want to take some calls.
[02:24:17.465 --> 02:24:21.207]  First off, we have this Benjamin Netanyahu thing, which they never truly denied.
[02:24:21.487 --> 02:24:22.688]  He did get this warning.
[02:24:23.088 --> 02:24:24.388]  Other Israelis got this warning.
[02:24:24.408 --> 02:24:25.369]  That's now admitted.
[02:24:25.769 --> 02:24:27.490]  They're just arguing about the timeline.
[02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:34.853]  At the same time, we have this little message board note saying the new secret al-Qaeda did it, but then Arabic experts look at it.
[02:24:35.874 --> 02:24:36.754]  It's shoddily done.
[02:24:36.774 --> 02:24:40.856]  It isn't even true Arabic phrases or scriptures.
[02:24:40.896 --> 02:24:42.037]  Comments on both those issues?
[02:24:42.597 --> 02:24:44.638]  Well, first of all, I thought
[02:24:45.797 --> 02:24:49.740]  When I first heard of the bombing, my immediate reaction was IRA.
[02:24:50.781 --> 02:24:55.384]  But that didn't sort of fit into the big scheme of things.
[02:24:55.404 --> 02:25:05.591]  I think what's going to fit into the big scheme of things is there's going to be some sort of connection to probably Iran, which would obviously help solidify
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:09.605]  The ongoing debate as to when the U.S.
[02:25:09.665 --> 02:25:13.210]  is going to attack Iran, which is front and center.
[02:25:13.250 --> 02:25:15.113]  Which they've been saying would be late this summer.
[02:25:15.393 --> 02:25:18.397]  Sure, which is on the front of Israeli agenda as well.
[02:25:19.359 --> 02:25:20.781]  So, yeah, I mean there's...
[02:25:21.474 --> 02:25:25.855]  There's many roads you can go down on this one.
[02:25:27.016 --> 02:25:28.396]  But they all go the same direction.
[02:25:28.816 --> 02:25:41.000]  Loss of freedom, empire building, and then of course, I could go onto a message board, type something out of the Koran, say, you know, the secret Al-Qaeda of Europe, and then I guess it'd be on national news.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:47.161]  It's like the guy last year who did the fake beheading in his garage in San Francisco, and for four days it was real!
[02:25:47.282 --> 02:25:48.602]  Al-Qaeda's killed again!
[02:25:49.323 --> 02:25:58.764]  Do you ever remember back in Arizona after the Oklahoma City bombing when the biggest threat to American domestic security was the militia?
[02:25:59.685 --> 02:26:04.186]  Well, meanwhile, covertly, the FBI and others, that's who they're still training for.
[02:26:04.886 --> 02:26:07.527]  The thing about Arabs is just for the public consumption.
[02:26:08.007 --> 02:26:08.407]  Oh, sure.
[02:26:08.827 --> 02:26:22.031]  But yeah, in Arizona, when that Amtrak train went down, all of a sudden, the only connection that they could come up with to a militia group was a note that was found besides the derailed train that said, Army of God.
[02:26:22.771 --> 02:26:25.872]  Now, whoever the Army of God was, but anyway, that justified
[02:26:26.890 --> 02:26:40.900]  uh... uh... huge uh... invasion into arizona of many as a matter of fact the FBI put out a pamphlet in in in arizona uh... telling folks how to how to identify suspected uh... internal terrorists.
[02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:42.942]  They make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:26:42.982 --> 02:26:43.702]  Constitution.
[02:26:43.742 --> 02:26:44.803]  They own guns.
[02:26:46.905 --> 02:26:48.166]  They put out 25,000 of those.
[02:26:48.506 --> 02:26:48.806]  I know.
[02:26:49.506 --> 02:26:52.288]  I mean you can you can just see where this whole thing is going.
[02:26:52.889 --> 02:26:55.531]  By the way, Colonel Craig Roberts
[02:26:56.454 --> 02:26:58.317]  Do you know General Reimer?
[02:26:58.337 --> 02:26:58.397]  Yes.
[02:27:12.617 --> 02:27:12.937]  Yes.
[02:27:13.417 --> 02:27:21.761]  Well, he's got, he is the guy that is now putting forward the information about domestic terrorism in the United States.
[02:27:21.861 --> 02:27:25.483]  And how we need to have troops on the streets.
[02:27:25.823 --> 02:27:26.123]  Absolutely.
[02:27:26.224 --> 02:27:31.006]  And the end of Posse Comitatus, somebody who's commanded the army murdering U.S.
[02:27:31.046 --> 02:27:31.526]  citizens.
[02:27:31.566 --> 02:27:32.286]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.255 --> 02:27:39.257]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.178 --> 02:27:42.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.953 --> 02:27:53.420]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:57.723]  Across the country there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.
[02:27:57.964 --> 02:28:09.574]  By calling 1-888-PETS-911 or visiting 1-888-PETS-911.org, you will find the location of your closest adoption facility, as well as tons of other information you need to know as a responsible pet owner.
[02:28:09.794 --> 02:28:11.415]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[02:28:15.350 --> 02:28:17.050]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:28:17.250 --> 02:28:19.251]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:28:19.451 --> 02:28:20.151]  Prepare yourself.
[02:28:20.311 --> 02:28:23.991]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[02:28:24.152 --> 02:28:29.892]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book, The Bible Says, for free.
[02:28:29.952 --> 02:28:31.333]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[02:28:31.513 --> 02:28:34.113]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[02:28:34.253 --> 02:28:35.793]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[02:28:36.134 --> 02:28:38.894]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[02:28:38.954 --> 02:28:39.694]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:28:45.490 --> 02:28:51.752]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.872 --> 02:28:58.054]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.314 --> 02:29:06.736]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.996 --> 02:29:14.018]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.318 --> 02:29:19.162]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.362 --> 02:29:24.786]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.126 --> 02:29:28.208]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.528 --> 02:29:36.494]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.534 --> 02:29:37.114]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.871 --> 02:29:52.775]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:29:53.295 --> 02:29:58.698]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:29:59.118 --> 02:30:09.144]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:30:09.284 --> 02:30:11.625]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:30:12.005 --> 02:30:15.047]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:30:15.507 --> 02:30:16.668]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:30:16.808 --> 02:30:19.670]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:30:19.970 --> 02:30:24.293]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:30:24.554 --> 02:30:26.295]  It's also money back guarantee.
[02:30:26.635 --> 02:30:38.403]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[02:30:38.884 --> 02:30:43.247]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:30:51.449 --> 02:30:52.369]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:30:52.409 --> 02:30:53.110]  A bunch of news.
[02:30:53.170 --> 02:30:54.651]  Robbie Noel riding shotgun with us.
[02:30:54.671 --> 02:31:00.156]  He, of course, grew up, spent most of his life in what is Zimbabwe today.
[02:31:00.176 --> 02:31:01.017]  Of course, Rhodesia.
[02:31:01.037 --> 02:31:03.659]  They're in the southern area of Africa.
[02:31:05.881 --> 02:31:08.864]  Right now, lips zipped reporter in jail.
[02:31:08.884 --> 02:31:11.306]  We're not talking about how they're arresting reporters all over the place.
[02:31:11.326 --> 02:31:11.606]  We're not
[02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:13.131]  Giving up sources.
[02:31:13.151 --> 02:31:14.332]  This is happening all over the country.
[02:31:14.412 --> 02:31:15.833]  Oh no, we're not talking about CAFTA.
[02:31:16.214 --> 02:31:17.775]  We're not talking about New Freedom.
[02:31:17.795 --> 02:31:26.543]  We're not talking about Karl Rove, who could have easily been sacked over blowing the whistle on a bunch of CIA agents with the plane incident.
[02:31:27.284 --> 02:31:31.128]  Nope, the bombing has got the G8 now saying they're changing their focus.
[02:31:32.913 --> 02:31:35.094]  Changing their focus to fight terror.
[02:31:35.614 --> 02:31:39.056]  And all over the world, despots are murdering hundreds of thousands of their dissidents.
[02:31:39.477 --> 02:31:42.138]  Innocent families using the war on terror.
[02:31:43.138 --> 02:31:48.701]  And by the way, the numbers are now up to 50 plus dead and 700 injured.
[02:31:50.322 --> 02:31:51.243]  So that's the numbers there.
[02:31:51.643 --> 02:31:54.905]  Before we go back to Robbie and of course your calls, just briefly folks.
[02:31:56.545 --> 02:31:59.027]  I have made my most powerful documentary film.
[02:31:59.047 --> 02:32:00.127]  It's been out for a few months.
[02:32:00.367 --> 02:32:01.148]  It is brutal.
[02:32:02.434 --> 02:32:03.935]  In how plainly we state it.
[02:32:04.355 --> 02:32:05.336]  We show the evidence.
[02:32:05.396 --> 02:32:06.437]  It is encyclopedic.
[02:32:06.497 --> 02:32:07.157]  It is riveting.
[02:32:07.597 --> 02:32:10.399]  It is martial law, 9-1-1, rise of the police state.
[02:32:11.059 --> 02:32:12.860]  It covers the latest police state developments.
[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:13.901]  We spend a full hour on 9-11.
[02:32:14.101 --> 02:32:15.682]  It's three films in one.
[02:32:16.102 --> 02:32:20.004]  And an hour on who the globalists are, what their master plan is, what their ideology is.
[02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:23.366]  And the main focus is government-sponsored terror.
[02:32:23.406 --> 02:32:24.307]  It is my best film.
[02:32:24.327 --> 02:32:26.468]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, is my second best.
[02:32:26.488 --> 02:32:27.909]  If you haven't gotten it, you need to get it.
[02:32:28.721 --> 02:32:39.863]  Uh, we also have Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, my book, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:32:41.050 --> 02:32:43.593]  And we've got big discounts on my films right now.
[02:32:43.613 --> 02:32:46.536]  When you get multiple copies, they're as low as $5.95 apiece.
[02:32:46.856 --> 02:32:53.223]  So when you call the toll-free number or you go to the website, be sure and look at all the different specials we're offering and take advantage of those.
[02:32:53.283 --> 02:32:56.086]  I don't know how long I'm going to continue to offer these specials.
[02:32:56.647 --> 02:32:57.728]  The toll-free number to order.
[02:32:57.768 --> 02:32:59.150]  They can answer all your questions when you call.
[02:32:59.170 --> 02:32:59.230]  1-888-424-9000.
[02:33:02.073 --> 02:33:02.293]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[02:33:02.313 --> 02:33:03.034]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:33:41.495 --> 02:33:43.136]  I have four employees.
[02:33:43.216 --> 02:33:44.496]  I have five websites.
[02:33:44.536 --> 02:33:45.536]  I have all these servers.
[02:33:46.136 --> 02:33:47.377]  Victims of our own success.
[02:33:47.477 --> 02:33:48.417]  We need your support.
[02:33:48.777 --> 02:33:50.037]  To PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:51.078 --> 02:33:57.779]  And by getting the film, Marshall Law and the others, you can wake your friends and family up to who is behind the terror and they will lose their power.
[02:33:57.799 --> 02:33:59.920]  Robbie, we're about to go to calls, but I want to bring this up to you.
[02:34:01.434 --> 02:34:04.375]  I have giant sections on my website of mainstream news.
[02:34:04.795 --> 02:34:15.618]  The phony Mossad-Al Qaeda cell in Palestine, where they went and grabbed young Palestinians, trained them, recruited them to work for Mossad and Shin Bet, to carry out terror as a pretext to expand the police state in Israel.
[02:34:15.959 --> 02:34:18.519]  The British government's been caught carrying out their own bombings.
[02:34:18.619 --> 02:34:19.380]  Mainstream news.
[02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:20.900]  A huge archive on that.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:23.001]  Putin's been caught blowing up his own buildings.
[02:34:23.321 --> 02:34:26.142]  The sinking of the Main in 1898, now admitted to be government.
[02:34:26.342 --> 02:34:27.602]  The Uphold of Tonkin never happened.
[02:34:27.622 --> 02:34:29.903]  We have official government documents like Operation Northwoods.
[02:34:30.498 --> 02:34:40.683]  You know, not just who has the motive, that being the government, for these bombings, and then all the evidence of Netanyahu being warned and all this, but just prior history, prior M.O.
[02:34:40.703 --> 02:34:47.806]  of who is normally behind terror, either actually doing it, state sponsored, or paying people to do it.
[02:34:48.026 --> 02:34:48.947]  Your comments on that?
[02:34:49.989 --> 02:34:54.531]  Well, I mean, we've entered into a new paradigm because you've got to understand something.
[02:34:54.611 --> 02:34:56.172]  War on Terror is big business.
[02:34:56.392 --> 02:34:57.773]  Bush said it'll last a hundred years.
[02:34:58.193 --> 02:34:58.573]  Oh, sure.
[02:34:58.833 --> 02:35:00.334]  And it's huge money.
[02:35:00.394 --> 02:35:01.695]  It's like the War on Poverty.
[02:35:02.295 --> 02:35:06.977]  We spent seven trillion dollars on the War on Poverty and there's more poor people today than ever before.
[02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:08.078]  I've got to interrupt you.
[02:35:08.098 --> 02:35:09.778]  The War on Drugs, it's the same thing.
[02:35:09.858 --> 02:35:10.959]  It's a big business.
[02:35:11.079 --> 02:35:14.400]  I was at the grocery store this weekend and I saw Barron's, the big financial paper.
[02:35:15.621 --> 02:35:17.422]  It was for the 4th of July and it said
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:24.823]  Yesterday, when the bombings were first announced, it took them three bombs to go off before they realized it was a bombing attack.
[02:35:24.903 --> 02:35:28.164]  First of all, they thought it was transformer or power surges.
[02:35:41.026 --> 02:35:42.607]  The Dow was down 90 points.
[02:35:43.207 --> 02:35:51.230]  The Dow closed up yesterday 36 points, predicated simply on companies that deal in security.
[02:35:52.291 --> 02:35:55.692]  I mean, that was what the Dow recovered yesterday.
[02:35:55.832 --> 02:35:56.692]  It's big business.
[02:35:56.752 --> 02:36:03.975]  I mean, General Reimer's website, which is called the National Counterterrorism Center, which is now the primary center for U.S.
[02:36:04.015 --> 02:36:05.696]  government analysis on terrorism,
[02:36:06.394 --> 02:36:10.637]  It's funded by Homeland Security to the tune of billions of dollars.
[02:36:10.817 --> 02:36:12.098]  I mean, it's big business.
[02:36:12.138 --> 02:36:13.439]  They have conventions.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:15.861]  They have conventions.
[02:36:15.901 --> 02:36:17.582]  You can go to fedgov.org.
[02:36:18.623 --> 02:36:19.423]  They got conventions.
[02:36:19.443 --> 02:36:21.124]  They just had one in Austin two weeks ago!
[02:36:21.365 --> 02:36:24.667]  Yeah, I mean, they have 2,000 vendors, for goodness sake.
[02:36:25.470 --> 02:36:35.118]  And when you go to these anti-terror summits, it's cop gear, stun guns, checkpoint material, face scanners, nothing to do with terror in the classical sense.
[02:36:35.158 --> 02:36:39.141]  But you read Section 802 of the First Patriot Act, and what does it say, Robbie?
[02:36:39.441 --> 02:36:41.343]  It says every American's a terrorist.
[02:36:41.463 --> 02:36:47.128]  Every misdemeanor, or the suspicion of a misdemeanor, you are stripped of your basic rights.
[02:36:47.148 --> 02:36:50.730]  And now they're pushing the expansion of the Patriot Act?
[02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:52.312]  They're pushing the expansion of the war?
[02:36:52.672 --> 02:36:53.753]  Who does this aid?
[02:36:55.132 --> 02:36:59.215]  They're arresting 13-year-old kids and charging them with terrorism acts.
[02:36:59.676 --> 02:37:03.339]  Homeless people sleeping in a bus station are pot dealers!
[02:37:04.781 --> 02:37:06.963]  You better get very nervous, Mr. Jones.
[02:37:07.785 --> 02:37:09.126]  Well, you've seen this before.
[02:37:09.266 --> 02:37:11.508]  We were talking during a break.
[02:37:11.528 --> 02:37:13.910]  This is deja vu for you, Robbie.
[02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:16.893]  You grew up in this in Southern Africa.
[02:37:17.173 --> 02:37:21.096]  Yeah, I'm watching it unfold for the second time.
[02:37:21.957 --> 02:37:23.879]  I really hope I don't lose a third country.
[02:37:23.939 --> 02:37:25.760]  I've lost two already.
[02:37:26.521 --> 02:37:28.323]  This is where I draw the line in the sand.
[02:37:28.383 --> 02:37:29.524]  Three and I'm out, brother.
[02:37:29.964 --> 02:37:31.185]  Well, explain how that happened.
[02:37:31.225 --> 02:37:32.766]  First you're in Rhodesia, then South Africa?
[02:37:33.167 --> 02:37:33.347]  Sure.
[02:37:34.472 --> 02:37:47.357]  And there's no question, the ultimate demise of Southern Africa was predicated on stupid white people introducing, and by the way, that's what I call the folks at the G8, the collection of stupid white people.
[02:37:48.815 --> 02:37:56.684]  But in the aggregate, the elite knows what they're doing, but they use this quote, guilt, just to get any middle class out of Africa, and now it's robbing and looting.
[02:37:57.085 --> 02:38:01.590]  Oh sure, and in large part a lot of what's going on with the aid to Africa is white guilt.
[02:38:02.211 --> 02:38:04.954]  It's an inherent problem that white people have to live with.
[02:38:05.315 --> 02:38:07.618]  But really, Robbie, that is used
[02:38:08.238 --> 02:38:19.948]  As a pretext to get control, and as you said, they go in and pay off these dictators to simply do what the IMF and World Bank says and keep control of their populations if they don't like having their land taken.
[02:38:20.288 --> 02:38:20.648]  Oh, sure.
[02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:35.761]  I mean, every single one of these black despot dictators that were at the G8, that are now going to be standing with their hands out waiting for part and parcel of the $50 billion that's going to come to them, what they're going to do is they're going to put together
[02:38:36.736 --> 02:38:54.803]  uh... the government agencies like the government for a form of corruption uh... in order to appease uh... the guys from the world bank and the IMF and nothing is going to change in any way shape or form that'll just give the government a new funded organization to actually persecute people oh there's no question about that
[02:38:55.447 --> 02:39:22.584]  You know the thing that's funny on Dr. General Reimer's website where he identifies terrorist groups he identifies the ANC as a terrorist group but then there's a disclaimer at the bottom of the page that says although the ANC was a terrorist group it is no longer a terrorist group because now they're in charge of the government so you know a decade ago it was a terrorist organization now it's a legitimate organization which by the way
[02:39:23.391 --> 02:39:35.938]  As I said before, Thabo Mbiki's South African government have introduced new terrorism legislation which pretty much would get you defined as a terrorist if you sneeze in front of a government official.
[02:39:36.963 --> 02:39:40.064]  Unbelievable, folks, and the borders are wide open.
[02:39:40.424 --> 02:39:44.425]  All right, we've actually got a few lines open because people have been holding for 45 minutes and have been dropping off.
[02:39:44.725 --> 02:39:46.626]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:39:46.646 --> 02:39:46.746]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:39:46.766 --> 02:39:49.067]  Mike in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[02:39:49.087 --> 02:39:49.607]  You're on the air.
[02:39:49.647 --> 02:39:50.027]  Go ahead.
[02:39:50.067 --> 02:39:50.487]  Yes, hi.
[02:39:50.507 --> 02:39:53.948]  Robbie, I'm curious, did you ever read Ivor Benson's book, The Zionist Factor?
[02:39:53.968 --> 02:39:54.188]  No, sir.
[02:40:04.907 --> 02:40:11.809]  Okay, you may get a different impression of what happened in your part of the world after you read that.
[02:40:12.509 --> 02:40:17.591]  Benton, like you, suffered through the destruction of South Africa.
[02:40:18.972 --> 02:40:20.992]  South Africa did have a large Jewish population.
[02:40:23.673 --> 02:40:26.734]  Outside of Israel, it had the largest Jewish population in the world.
[02:40:27.609 --> 02:40:33.655]  By the way, you cannot debate the fact that South Africa is worse off right now, especially for the blacks.
[02:40:33.715 --> 02:40:36.218]  I mean, it has the highest murder rate in the world now?
[02:40:37.038 --> 02:40:38.119]  Oh, well, there's no question.
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:40.762]  The rape statistics are amazing.
[02:40:40.802 --> 02:40:44.365]  There's actual genocide going on in South Africa, but nobody wants to talk about it.
[02:40:45.066 --> 02:40:50.892]  But hasn't Oppenheimers and Rothschilds, haven't they fared pretty well?
[02:40:54.820 --> 02:41:05.267]  Well, it is true that the Oppenheimers and the World Diamond Monopoly front De Beers did actually help a lot of this and did consolidate and destroy what was a middle class in South Africa.
[02:41:05.307 --> 02:41:06.989]  I have seen the documentation on that, Robbie.
[02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:09.671]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's a fact of life.
[02:41:09.851 --> 02:41:15.375]  I mean, what we are dealing with here is ultimately Cecil John Rhodes' vision.
[02:41:16.559 --> 02:41:28.064]  Which was put together under the organization called the Round Table in the late 1800s and that ventured across the pond in 1913 to the United States.
[02:41:28.424 --> 02:41:32.366]  And that was known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs in the U.S., the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:41:32.386 --> 02:41:33.467]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:41:33.747 --> 02:41:43.611]  And I'm sure you saw the Lou Dobbs piece with the two members from the CFR talking about Canada, America and Mexico.
[02:41:43.931 --> 02:41:46.193]  Well, we had Mr. Priest on with the CFR.
[02:41:46.213 --> 02:41:48.395]  He's openly pushing the end of sovereignty.
[02:41:48.515 --> 02:41:48.735]  Sure.
[02:41:49.096 --> 02:41:51.177]  I mean, that's the Rhodes' vision.
[02:41:51.538 --> 02:41:58.244]  Well, Rhodes had a vision of Anglo-Saxon rule over the world, the white man's burden.
[02:41:58.984 --> 02:42:02.948]  But Rhodes was also effectively an agent for the Rothschilds.
[02:42:03.188 --> 02:42:10.875]  And I think his financial backers had a much different picture of the ideal world that they had in mind.
[02:42:11.454 --> 02:42:12.674]  And they let Rhodes run the ball.
[02:42:12.794 --> 02:42:14.435]  Well, this is what happened with empires.
[02:42:14.635 --> 02:42:17.336]  They learned 150 years ago, take their flag down.
[02:42:17.976 --> 02:42:19.196]  Empires, take your flag down.
[02:42:19.217 --> 02:42:20.037]  You don't get resistance.
[02:42:20.357 --> 02:42:22.077]  Put a dictator in who you control.
[02:42:22.117 --> 02:42:24.578]  Your empire owns and controls more than ever.
[02:42:25.038 --> 02:42:25.659]  And it's simple.
[02:42:25.739 --> 02:42:28.059]  The Anglo-American establishment took over the world.
[02:42:28.559 --> 02:42:34.061]  Then they pulled out, putting in their corporate managers over those client states with puppets in charge.
[02:42:34.081 --> 02:42:34.942]  Do you agree, gentlemen?
[02:42:35.302 --> 02:42:35.502]  Sure.
[02:42:35.822 --> 02:42:36.302]  No question.
[02:42:37.173 --> 02:42:38.614]  Well, pretty simple, isn't it?
[02:42:38.854 --> 02:42:58.445]  You know, Colonel Don DeGranpre did a pretty good analysis in his book, Barbarians Inside the Gates, and basically he describes the One World Movement as having two heads or two wings, the Zionist Bolshevik branch and the Anglo-American branch, or the Fabian branch, if you will.
[02:42:59.346 --> 02:43:06.430]  But both trails ultimately lead you back to the Rothschilds and those big private investment bankers.
[02:43:06.977 --> 02:43:07.877]  Alright, thank you.
[02:43:08.017 --> 02:43:09.417]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[02:43:09.477 --> 02:43:11.098]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Kentucky.
[02:43:11.138 --> 02:43:11.898]  Jeremy, go ahead.
[02:43:11.918 --> 02:43:13.258]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:13.658 --> 02:43:13.918]  Hi.
[02:43:14.278 --> 02:43:15.018]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:43:15.078 --> 02:43:15.298]  Good!
[02:43:16.199 --> 02:43:22.860]  Um, I would just like to say that, uh, I would... Can you get... Sounds like you've got a radio up.
[02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:24.880]  No, I don't.
[02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:26.140]  Okay, your phone was distorted.
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:26.720]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:28.061]  Okay, I'm sorry about that.
[02:43:28.801 --> 02:43:34.762]  Uh, do you got a copy of the, uh, radio show you did before 9-11?
[02:43:36.385 --> 02:43:37.065]  The day before?
[02:43:37.605 --> 02:43:39.526]  I didn't do a show the day before.
[02:43:39.566 --> 02:43:45.007]  I did one on July 25th, the radio and TV show, yes, where I said, call the White House, tell them don't attack the World Trade Center.
[02:43:45.328 --> 02:43:48.348]  And there's a clip of that video in my film, The Masters of Terror.
[02:43:48.869 --> 02:43:57.171]  Yeah, and also that there in this London, what happened yesterday, it's just a, if people don't wake up and
[02:44:01.096 --> 02:44:02.556]  America's going down the road.
[02:44:03.036 --> 02:44:03.256]  It is.
[02:44:03.317 --> 02:44:04.057]  I appreciate the call.
[02:44:04.097 --> 02:44:07.718]  I mean, look, it's bolstering their entire agenda that was stalling.
[02:44:07.778 --> 02:44:08.498]  Look at the motive.
[02:44:08.878 --> 02:44:22.943]  And then, Robbie, it's very bizarre that... I mean, this was a real Islamist group, which are very few and far between, and even when they're real, they're normally funded by some intelligence agency, and they're just useful idiots, but very unusual to not have somebody taking credit, Robbie.
[02:44:23.383 --> 02:44:33.476]  Well sure, and the statement that was issued by that alleged website, the timing was just too convenient for it.
[02:44:34.237 --> 02:44:35.960]  And we haven't heard anything since.
[02:44:36.698 --> 02:44:41.441]  Well, on 9-11, within 20 minutes, they were already showing pictures of Bin Laden saying, did he do it?
[02:44:41.882 --> 02:44:44.804]  Within about 10 hours, they were saying that we think he did it.
[02:44:45.064 --> 02:44:48.766]  The next day, about 15 hours later, they had all the hijackers' names.
[02:44:48.786 --> 02:44:51.688]  Turned out those were all fake lists, and fake, by the way, wasn't even true.
[02:44:52.949 --> 02:44:54.070]  That was proven to be a fraud.
[02:44:54.510 --> 02:45:01.495]  And this time, within an hour, they had Al-Qaeda training tapes on US and British TV, charging you with machine guns.
[02:45:02.015 --> 02:45:03.357]  Al-Qaeda training tapes!
[02:45:03.657 --> 02:45:05.699]  I mean, so everybody's saying Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:05.739 --> 02:45:06.540]  This is ridiculous!
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:07.501]  It is.
[02:45:07.521 --> 02:45:11.044]  I mean, if it wasn't so tragic, it would be actually quite laughable.
[02:45:11.925 --> 02:45:13.847]  Well, bottom line, Robbie, who do you think's behind this?
[02:45:14.764 --> 02:45:23.454]  Well, there's no question that we have... Look, the whole fight is always over power or money.
[02:45:24.335 --> 02:45:25.456]  So take your choice.
[02:45:25.817 --> 02:45:28.900]  And obviously in this instance, it's a power grab.
[02:45:29.521 --> 02:45:33.966]  It's to try and save Blair and Bush from the embarrassment of
[02:45:35.107 --> 02:45:38.370]  Yeah, I haven't been listening to your program at all.
[02:45:38.450 --> 02:45:41.953]  I just finished up reading a little bit of the paper and maybe
[02:45:54.297 --> 02:45:55.978]  I had a question, a real quick question for you.
[02:45:55.998 --> 02:45:58.219]  Well, that's a nice first announcement that you're not listening.
[02:45:59.059 --> 02:45:59.419]  Well, no.
[02:45:59.439 --> 02:46:01.981]  Go ahead, Terry, make your point.
[02:46:02.121 --> 02:46:09.684]  I saw your movie in Austin, and in the paper, in the July 1st paper, they have a thing of those, they call it the Scream.
[02:46:09.764 --> 02:46:14.526]  You know, you have that in your movie about the sound cannons they used in New York, in the RNC.
[02:46:14.846 --> 02:46:15.806]  Yeah, the sound cannons.
[02:46:16.067 --> 02:46:17.287]  Well, they call that the Scream.
[02:46:17.307 --> 02:46:18.608]  Has anybody called into you about this?
[02:46:18.628 --> 02:46:19.348]  They call it the Scream.
[02:46:19.368 --> 02:46:21.689]  They use it in Israel to get the Palestinians.
[02:46:23.021 --> 02:46:34.554]  Well, I mean, it's called an LRAD, Long Range Acoustical Device, and it can damage your hearing, and it's a focused sound beam, but I don't, you're talking about the scream, I just don't know.
[02:46:34.755 --> 02:46:35.736]  Oh, that's it at Waco?
[02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:37.330]  Yes, they did.
[02:46:37.551 --> 02:46:39.151]  But back then only the Russians had it.
[02:46:39.171 --> 02:46:40.772]  So they had a Russian and Israeli team.
[02:46:40.972 --> 02:46:42.933]  This is Time Magazine, Fort Worcester Telegram.
[02:46:43.714 --> 02:46:46.135]  It was like a special forces barbecue.
[02:46:46.535 --> 02:46:58.522]  About eight different countries were there and the Russians had a white noise machine torturing them and playing the sounds of dead and dying rabbits with Gregorian monks chanting with the sounds of screams going 24 hours a day.
[02:46:58.562 --> 02:47:00.183]  They did that to Noriega as well.
[02:47:01.424 --> 02:47:05.446]  Remember when they surrounded his camp, Manuel Noriega?
[02:47:06.215 --> 02:47:10.216]  Look at all the psychological warfare machines and everything they're rolling out against us.
[02:47:10.316 --> 02:47:10.936]  I mean, it's sick.
[02:47:10.996 --> 02:47:11.757]  Terry, anything else?
[02:47:12.217 --> 02:47:12.577]  Oh, no.
[02:47:12.617 --> 02:47:16.378]  It's just total, utter sickness and evil.
[02:47:17.038 --> 02:47:26.501]  They did say that they have not tested this machine for long periods of time, but they say it induces nausea when you listen to this, and dizziness.
[02:47:28.934 --> 02:47:29.935]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:47:30.235 --> 02:47:32.858]  Here's an email I got Alex this morning around 9.15.
[02:47:33.278 --> 02:47:40.846]  Tony Snow, Fox News Show, called for the United States and other countries to break down the doors of mosques and arrest the people involved in organized crime.
[02:47:40.926 --> 02:47:41.607]  What does that mean?
[02:47:41.947 --> 02:47:43.489]  He also said, what is the difference between
[02:47:44.321 --> 02:47:53.005]  People involved in organized crime, and it wasn't between people, uh, uh, involved in, I'm sorry, it cut off here, in the freedom of religion and organized crime.
[02:47:53.405 --> 02:47:54.045]  What does that mean?
[02:47:54.106 --> 02:47:56.487]  What is the difference between organized crime and the freedom of religion?
[02:47:57.207 --> 02:48:04.770]  Uh, in a rhetorical fashion, Tony further proceeded to say that Al-Qaeda was a group of angry guys in a basement drinking beer.
[02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:06.531]  I mean, what does this mean, Robbie?
[02:48:06.931 --> 02:48:07.372]  I don't know.
[02:48:07.732 --> 02:48:08.872]  I don't even watch Fox.
[02:48:09.713 --> 02:48:12.534]  I gave up on Fox a long, long time ago.
[02:48:13.571 --> 02:48:23.114]  uh... but it's it's it's it's just the mindset of these people you know they they want to put the boogeyman in perspective and the boogeyman wears a muslim face.
[02:48:23.435 --> 02:48:24.235]  Look at this email.
[02:48:24.375 --> 02:48:29.857]  The world knows that Al-Qaeda is a product of the CIA and that the Bush's and the Bin Laden's have been long-term business partners.
[02:48:29.937 --> 02:48:31.477]  Bob, London, England.
[02:48:31.877 --> 02:48:34.158]  Yeah, they're just lucky that muslims aren't black.
[02:48:34.518 --> 02:48:36.239]  Some are, but most of them are not.
[02:48:36.359 --> 02:48:38.320]  If they were black, they'd have a serious problem.
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:41.561]  Alright, we'll be right back folks with the final segment.
[02:48:41.581 --> 02:48:41.961]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.886 --> 02:48:54.271]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.551 --> 02:48:59.294]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.514 --> 02:49:05.198]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.358 --> 02:49:09.901]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.

[02:51:46.747 --> 02:51:53.349]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.339 --> 02:52:02.221]  We're about to take a call from London and a few others if we have time, last little five minutes here, but this is Tony Blair, February 23rd of this year.
[02:52:02.241 --> 02:52:13.545]  Were there to be serious terrorist acts in this country, and afterwards it was thought that we had not taken the measures necessary, believe me, no one would be talking about civil liberties.
[02:52:14.025 --> 02:52:19.327]  They would be talking about why we had not done more to protect the security of this country.
[02:52:19.747 --> 02:52:21.128]  Not quite a Tony Blair accent, but...
[02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:22.290]  Close enough.
[02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:23.811]  I mean, talk about in your face.
[02:52:23.831 --> 02:52:26.372]  Here's one from Switzerland, and I did find the news article on this.
[02:52:27.112 --> 02:52:33.015]  On the Swiss news, due to the London attacks, now they will change the law that forbids the military to do police work, assisting police.
[02:52:34.275 --> 02:52:38.357]  Two, all convicted criminals must now leave DNA for a DNA register.
[02:52:38.597 --> 02:52:40.598]  So everywhere it's being used for a police state.
[02:52:41.699 --> 02:52:43.659]  Let's go to Cameron in London.
[02:52:43.699 --> 02:52:45.140]  You're on with Alex Jones and Robbie Noel.
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:45.840]  Go ahead, Cameron.
[02:52:46.601 --> 02:52:47.101]  Hello, Alex.
[02:52:47.121 --> 02:52:48.522]  My think is that
[02:52:49.989 --> 02:52:58.216]  Bush and Blair didn't lie about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq because that is a totally false debate.
[02:53:00.097 --> 02:53:14.069]  The main point nobody seems to keep making is that Iraq had every right to possess weapons of mass destruction and this surrender that was put upon them by Norman Schwarzkopf was totally illegal and without any worth.
[02:53:15.391 --> 02:53:23.799]  Well, you're right in saying that either you accept the UNN running your country or the globalists invade you, so that's really a false choice right there, but they did lie about the WNDs.
[02:53:24.119 --> 02:53:24.820]  Robbie, comment.
[02:53:26.883 --> 02:53:40.147]  I mean, that's one of the things that Saddam Hussein had a problem with, and that was the UN mandating what he could and could not do in order to defend himself.
[02:53:40.367 --> 02:53:42.627]  Cameron in London, what are Londoners saying?
[02:53:42.687 --> 02:53:48.109]  We had about 10 calls from London yesterday, and they were all saying that half the folks they talked to thought it was the government off.
[02:53:48.129 --> 02:53:48.749]  What are you hearing?
[02:53:48.769 --> 02:53:54.811]  The problem is, just as in America, people are very gullible.
[02:53:56.335 --> 02:54:06.106]  I'm sure this ID card will get support and it will be railroaded through the government because we have to remember that Blair still has a 67 majority and they're brain dead.
[02:54:06.747 --> 02:54:11.172]  Yeah, they're trying to pass the ID card which they're saying would stop terrorists and now he's going, see?
[02:54:11.192 --> 02:54:12.974]  It will stop terrorists!
[02:54:13.855 --> 02:54:17.479]  Yeah, and the point keeps being made on the radio here and on the TV.
[02:54:18.300 --> 02:54:25.143]  Yeah, they're back saying that now, acting like Saddam somehow did this.
[02:54:25.203 --> 02:54:26.784]  It's unbelievable.
[02:54:27.344 --> 02:54:28.565]  Or maybe Iran did it.
[02:54:28.605 --> 02:54:29.345]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:29.906 --> 02:54:31.206]  One last caller.
[02:54:31.546 --> 02:54:32.607]  Who's up next in line here?
[02:54:34.182 --> 02:54:36.224]  Brooke and Rhode Island, last caller, sorry to others.
[02:54:36.304 --> 02:54:36.805]  Brooke, go ahead.
[02:54:36.825 --> 02:54:37.685]  That's alright, Alex.
[02:54:37.705 --> 02:54:50.737]  Hey, I tried to call in desperately when you were on George Norrie a couple weeks ago and the gentleman that was on the show was hitting on you constantly and I thought you behaved like an absolute gentleman in lieu of the fact.
[02:54:51.758 --> 02:54:54.701]  I had a comment to make about this whole thing in Britain
[02:54:55.308 --> 02:55:16.965]  It's interesting that George Bush fell off his bike and not only that but ran into a police officer and hospitalized him and fell off his bike a third time in two years and then the next day we had this bomb blast in London to defuse all the attention from George Bush's ability as far as being fit for office mentally and physically.
[02:55:18.507 --> 02:55:28.635]  And I also thought it was interesting that George Bush was meeting with the Royals of Denmark and England the day before his bicycle accident.
[02:55:29.216 --> 02:55:30.276]  I don't trust any of this.
[02:55:30.376 --> 02:55:32.058]  I think it's all extremely suspicious.
[02:55:32.774 --> 02:55:34.355]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[02:55:34.375 --> 02:55:35.116]  We're out of time.
[02:55:35.156 --> 02:55:36.257]  Back to 9-9 to midnight.
[02:55:36.377 --> 02:55:42.802]  Centraal on your local AM or FM station or on Global Shortwave at night at 3210 during the day at 9.985.
[02:55:43.462 --> 02:55:47.145]  And of course on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:48.366 --> 02:55:49.927]  We appreciate Robbie Noel coming on.
[02:55:49.987 --> 02:55:50.868]  Robbie, final comments?
[02:55:51.969 --> 02:56:00.275]  I guarantee you will not hear Bush say, the reason we are fighting them over there is that we don't have to fight them over here anymore.
[02:56:01.445 --> 02:56:02.046]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:02.366 --> 02:56:02.987]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:03.147 --> 02:56:04.628]  Alright, thank you for coming on.
[02:56:05.109 --> 02:56:07.631]  Again, I really appreciate all the fine listeners.

[02:56:20.583 --> 02:56:22.365]  Get out there and expose the government terrorists.
[02:56:22.685 --> 02:56:23.406]  God bless you all.
