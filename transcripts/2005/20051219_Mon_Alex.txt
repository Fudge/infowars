[00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:06.362]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:08.084]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:09.905]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:11.366]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:13.047]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:17.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:26.055]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:29.518]  I've got a fever today.
[00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:39.834]  And, of course, the parallel would be I've got a burning fever for liberty and freedom and decency and honor and fighting corruption and not being a slave.
[00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:45.158]  But I should be at the Hacienda in bed today, you know, so I get over this.
[00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:52.023]  But watching Bush in his radio address, which is also an excuse to have a televised speech,
[00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:55.896]  We're good to go.
[00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:56.817]  We're good to go.
[00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:27.740]  His reporting has been just extremely accurate and real insight and great connections in the government.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.100]  He lives in D.C.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:42.103]  and he'll come on and tell you really about government spying and how long it's been going on and not this ridiculous propaganda that we've been hearing from Alberto Gonzalez and Bush and the rest of that gaggle of crooks.
[00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:48.510]  So I want to go over the three different speeches he's given in the last three days.
[00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.154]  One of them is ending an hour ago or so.
[00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:54.679]  And how he says it will save our lives.
[00:01:55.695 --> 00:02:04.719]  Then he says the Patriot Act is the same as what we have with medical records and with laws with criminals, laws with drugs.
[00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.740]  And that's true and it's not true.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.963]  Yes, they have laws where they just take your property, no drugs, no witnesses, no evidence, no indictment, no arrest.
[00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:15.003]  They just take everything you've got.
[00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:16.364]  Houses, cars.
[00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.512]  And yeah, there are rules for taking people's children.
[00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.234]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:23.095]  Just take them.
[00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:26.238]  And there are lots of things the government's been doing that are totally unconstitutional and criminal.
[00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.123]  That's like saying one arm's already been chopped off, so let's chop off the other two legs on the other arm.
[00:02:31.143 --> 00:02:34.346]  You know, since one's already been hacked off.
[00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:39.751]  But there's a lot of stuff in the Patriot Act that was not already on the books.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.082]  I mean, the government's done lots of things that aren't constitutional or totally un-American, but that doesn't legitimize the latest salvos in this fight.
[00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:59.605]  But it is a lie to say that the Patriot Act is the same as the past outrages and the past abominations to our Bill of Rights and Constitution and our way of life.
[00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:08.667]  And I'm sorry, for somebody who researches this and really studies it, it's just almost comical how it's just all lies.
[00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:09.487]  It's just...
[00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:14.503]  Total and complete lies from start to finish, up one side and down the other.
[00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:19.535]  And people in intelligence agencies who are in counterterrorism are...
[00:03:20.427 --> 00:03:20.887]  We're good to go.
[00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:21.688]  We're good to go.
[00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:53.188]  This whole NSA business has been brought out by design.
[00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:01.296]  This whole business with the Patriot Act failing, I believe, we'd like to toot our own horn, but I believe this is being done by design.
[00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:07.802]  And I think it portends, I think it is clear evidence that we are going to see the terror attack.
[00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:13.488]  I think we're now into those waters, and I'll give you time frames and what I think is going to happen on the other side.
[00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:19.687]  Clearly, clearly we are headed for the rocks in a big, big way.
[00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:24.250]  And hopefully what we're about to do when we get back will change that in some way.
[00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:25.751]  So stay with us.
[00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:28.753]  And we do have Wayne Madsen joining us in the third hour.
[00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.475]  And we're working on some other interesting guests today as well.
[00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:32.676]  We'll also have open phones.
[00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:33.137]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:33.197]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.282]  The website's freshly updated for you multiple times daily.
[00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:53.307]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, and don't ever forget MarshallLaw911.info.
[00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:57.888]  Just an unbelievable site that one of our listeners put together that I'm so proud of.
[00:04:57.908 --> 00:04:58.989]  Be sure and check that out.
[00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:09.564]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:14.590]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.457]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:25.218]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.438 --> 00:05:32.580]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.141]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:39.821]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:46.763]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:52.252]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.272 --> 00:05:52.693]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:12.243]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:19.909]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:20.629]  I think.
[00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.870]  I think.
[00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:40.103]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:42.044]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:48.166]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:48.406 --> 00:06:52.348]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:52.928]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:01.372 --> 00:07:03.354]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[00:07:03.414 --> 00:07:06.297]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:11.882]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:07:12.103 --> 00:07:13.624]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:15.926]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:19.590]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.651]  We're good to go.
[00:07:42.674 --> 00:07:43.435]  We're good to go.
[00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:44.095]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.420]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.141]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:10.001]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:11.442]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.182 --> 00:08:13.042]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:17.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.924 --> 00:08:22.065]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.646 --> 00:08:32.729]  Later in the shower, I got clips of Bush in his speech last night, clips of his ridiculous press conference today.
[00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:41.195]  Clips of Alberto Gonzalez and basically his entire crew making the rounds, lying through their teeth.
[00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:42.516]  It's constitutional.
[00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.037]  It keeps you safe.
[00:08:44.617 --> 00:08:48.459]  We're doing this so the terrorists won't get you.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.641]  You better basically give all your liberties up to us.
[00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:53.302]  Give up liberty for freedom.
[00:08:54.128 --> 00:09:04.054]  As one lady in England said to us, she thought the police shooting an unarmed man who walked into the train reading a newspaper, she said giving up liberty would give her freedom.
[00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:05.835]  That's an oxymoron.
[00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.877]  That's a 1984-esque statement.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.443]  But let me just, on the record today, try to calmly go over what's really happening right now.
[00:09:20.404 --> 00:09:21.905]  Number one, we have Bush
[00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:31.510]  Running around telling us that the terrorists are going to get us if we don't reauthorize the USA Patriot Act.
[00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:47.138]  And out of the different scenarios that I saw developing three years ago, when the reauthorization of the Patriot Act began to heat up, because even then they were trying to expand it and pass Patriot Act II, remember.
[00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.231]  Because it had a five-year sunset.
[00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:56.574]  Well, they had already implemented Patriot Act II, despite the fact they never even passed it.
[00:09:57.734 --> 00:10:05.018]  They're doing everything that's in Patriot Act II without even having a law, and Bush just claims he can do it through executive fiat.
[00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:12.562]  So understand, they were doing everything they're doing in the Patriot Act long before they ever passed the Patriot Act.
[00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:19.186]  And they've been doing everything that's in Patriot Act II since they signed Patriot Act I. On the record,
[00:10:20.732 --> 00:10:29.157]  So all of this talk about how if it expires, they're not going to be able to keep us safe and the terrorists are going to get us is just a political football.
[00:10:30.578 --> 00:10:41.524]  Now remember that Bush has been running around
[00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:57.731]  Telling us that all he wants to do is keep us safe, and so we've got to reauthorize this Patriot Act, and he's going to be able to keep us safe from evil Al-Ciada.
[00:11:02.114 --> 00:11:08.078]  So that's an important thing to just keep in mind, that that by its very nature is terrorism.
[00:11:08.598 --> 00:11:12.021]  Terrorism in the encyclopedia, terrorism in the dictionary,
[00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:26.449]  It has several different definitions, but they're basically all the same thing, and it is to threaten force or use force to coerce a civilian population or a government into accepting your aims.
[00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:42.894]  And so three years ago, one of many times he did this, when the Vice President, Dick Cheney, got up on Meet the Press and said, if you continue to investigate 9-11 and our supposed failure, you're ensuring Al-Qaeda will strike and it's going to be nuclear.
[00:11:44.634 --> 00:11:47.996]  So shut up, stop investigating us, or Al-Qaeda will strike.
[00:11:49.836 --> 00:11:51.757]  We've heard this over and over and over again.
[00:11:52.876 --> 00:11:56.218]  If you question anything they do or anything they say, the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:11:56.638 --> 00:11:58.939]  That, by its very nature, is terrorism.
[00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:15.087]  Then you look at who's behind the terrorism, and in case after case, time after time, it is criminal elements inside the military-industrial complex, bought and paid for by the big global central banks that openly run our country and 90-plus percent of the world.
[00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:20.289]  And any nation that they don't like, whether they're good, bad, or indifferent, I'm not defending those nations...
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.101]  Has one thing in common.
[00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.202]  They're sovereign.
[00:12:24.502 --> 00:12:27.604]  They don't have one of the big private central banks controlling them.
[00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:29.726]  They're not under New World Order control.
[00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:31.327]  Or not under enough control.
[00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:35.570]  And so we're in the middle of a global government forming around us.
[00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:37.172]  We're being enslaved.
[00:12:37.532 --> 00:12:42.155]  And the average American thinks, oh no, we got attacked by some Arabs and we're over there fighting them in Iraq.
[00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:44.257]  Which couldn't be further from reality.
[00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:46.487]  Iraq is meant to be a failure.
[00:12:46.527 --> 00:12:51.830]  It's meant to make the globalists over a trillion dollars in the next five years at least.
[00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:54.532]  Already made them, what, $400 billion over there.
[00:12:54.972 --> 00:12:57.434]  Weapon sales, contractions in oil.
[00:12:58.154 --> 00:13:02.577]  And it's about being able to neutralize political dissent here in the United States.
[00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:09.381]  And if I seem a little slow today, folks, I've got a fever and I'm sick right now.
[00:13:09.441 --> 00:13:12.784]  I just came in today because there's so much to talk about and...
[00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:17.888]  I feel a little bit dumbfounded with this pressure in my head, but I'm telling you.
[00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:22.433]  I'm just telling you that so people say I sound a little bit different today.
[00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:24.234]  You won't think I've been drinking Budweiser.
[00:13:25.255 --> 00:13:32.863]  But at the same time, please don't call in with all the cures, and please don't call in and tell me hang in there, and please don't call in and tell me what a great job I'm doing.
[00:13:32.903 --> 00:13:34.665]  Just please, please, please.
[00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:36.086]  I can't stand it.
[00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:40.418]  I didn't come on just now and tell you that I got a cold.
[00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:42.498]  So I get your sympathy.
[00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:46.479]  I told you that because I know I sound a little punch drunk here.
[00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:50.960]  It's just because I got a really bad headache and a lot of pressure in my sinus and I'm running a fever.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:59.042]  And I'm so angry about Bush and the rest of these criminals that I'm trying to, in a half-decent way, articulate what's going on.
[00:13:59.602 --> 00:14:03.463]  You don't have to call in and thank me and worship me and tell me how great I am.
[00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:05.443]  I'm not a neocon talk show host.
[00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:11.813]  You know, they've got it set up in this country where you call into these shows and you've got to step and fetch it.
[00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:13.234]  You've got to beg.
[00:14:13.354 --> 00:14:14.255]  You've got to plead.
[00:14:14.275 --> 00:14:15.676]  You've got to call in.
[00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:20.080]  You've got to grovel and tell them how great they are for a minute and a half before they even get you on the air.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.426]  Then once you get on air, you've got to tell them what a great job they're doing and how brave they are and how smart they are.
[00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:30.189]  And then you get on into your issues.
[00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:33.472]  And if you call in with a real point to make, they'll never let you on.
[00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:39.129]  And so you have to lie and then act like a neocon or act like a stupid liberal to be able to get on.
[00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:41.909]  And so that's just the situation we're facing.
[00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:50.652]  So please don't ever compare me to those other shows or those other ones where they all fakely thank you for your call and tell you how great you are every call, even if it's not a good call.
[00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:52.733]  That's just a side issue.
[00:14:52.793 --> 00:15:01.176]  It's just over the decade plus doing a talk show, it's become a real serious burn under the saddle.
[00:15:02.056 --> 00:15:02.176]  And...
[00:15:06.354 --> 00:15:06.715]  I don't know.
[00:15:06.755 --> 00:15:08.057]  It just comes down to that.
[00:15:08.077 --> 00:15:10.040]  Okay.
[00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:16.409]  You know, I'm here looking at all this and just how to analyze all the lies.
[00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.931]  You know, that's the problem.
[00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:20.335]  I could spend all day on just one line.
[00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:22.622]  And there's so many lies.
[00:15:23.063 --> 00:15:25.044]  And I want to do a better job.
[00:15:25.104 --> 00:15:26.425]  And I want to write more articles.
[00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:27.947]  And I want to warn people better.
[00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.288]  And I want to break down the propaganda better.
[00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:36.213]  And I want to be able to attempt to educate people and get people informed.
[00:15:36.273 --> 00:15:37.534]  Because we're losing our country.
[00:15:37.835 --> 00:15:42.078]  We're having a classical police state being set up that should scare everybody.
[00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:47.903]  And I just think about all the sycophants and people out there who have trained themselves
[00:15:52.606 --> 00:16:02.931]  Over the years, how to basically make excuses for all the corruption that's going on and decide somehow that it's all good.
[00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:05.392]  And if you want to do that, fine.
[00:16:05.412 --> 00:16:13.736]  I mean, if you think the National Security Agency and the Pentagon spying on people is what America's all about, then okay.
[00:16:14.096 --> 00:16:21.100]  If you want to swallow that poison pill with the sugar coating of it's to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda, which is Al-CIAIDA,
[00:16:21.827 --> 00:16:22.367]  So be it.
[00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:26.930]  And if you really want to believe that the spying began after 9-11, you've got another thing coming.
[00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:41.557]  That spying was going on, and every time the NSA or Defense Intelligence actually found out something was going on, they threatened to arrest the FBI or military people who were trying to stop Al Qaeda, because Al Qaeda, we've conclusively proved, were U.S.
[00:16:41.597 --> 00:16:43.838]  government agents taking part in live-action drills.
[00:16:44.658 --> 00:16:45.059]  No debate.
[00:16:45.099 --> 00:16:45.599]  It's confirmed.
[00:16:47.753 --> 00:16:50.136]  So there's that foundation right there.
[00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:52.339]  The whole thing's a fraud to begin with.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:59.068]  Then I hear this baloney out of Bush's speech about how they're not using the Patriot Act against U.S.
[00:16:59.108 --> 00:16:59.609]  citizens.
[00:17:01.514 --> 00:17:06.478]  Toy store owners getting visits from Homeland Security, and they say they, she asks, why are you here?
[00:17:06.518 --> 00:17:09.020]  I'm a tiny toy store in St.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.842]  Helen, Oregon, 1,200 square feet.
[00:17:12.662 --> 00:17:18.186]  Well, these magic cubes you're selling, these may have a patent on them.
[00:17:18.206 --> 00:17:20.568]  And she goes, no, I bought them from a big toy store supplier.
[00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:22.129]  Why don't you call them?
[00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:24.551]  And then they told her, don't tell anybody we were here.
[00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:28.413]  We can arrest you as a terrorist under this section of the Patriot Act.
[00:17:29.354 --> 00:17:30.435]  She doesn't listen to them.
[00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:34.102]  She calls the toy manufacturer.
[00:17:34.122 --> 00:17:35.142]  She calls the news.
[00:17:35.202 --> 00:17:43.845]  The Associated Press calls and finds out that the Magic Cube, the knockoff of the Rubik's Cube, has been sold for, what, four years before she got the visit in 2003.
[00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:47.606]  And we had her on the air, and we read the AP report.
[00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:51.047]  Now, that literally is about one out of several hundred.
[00:17:51.427 --> 00:17:52.928]  I have two articles today.
[00:17:53.658 --> 00:17:59.199]  Where they're using the Patriot Act to send the military to schools to spy on parents.
[00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.800]  Where they're sending... Let me just dig them out right here.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.420]  Let me find them.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.001]  They're here in the stack.
[00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:06.421]  Where is my article?
[00:18:07.281 --> 00:18:09.062]  Got the big bush stack on top of it.
[00:18:09.342 --> 00:18:09.522]  Here.
[00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:10.782]  Homeland Security.
[00:18:11.102 --> 00:18:13.263]  This is out of the Standard Times.
[00:18:13.643 --> 00:18:16.764]  Homeland Security visits student who requested Mount Saitama book.
[00:18:17.804 --> 00:18:21.905]  And the student was openly writing an article
[00:18:23.014 --> 00:18:24.496]  For his teacher.
[00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:28.300]  They were told to write an article about communism and fascism.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.741]  And so what do you do?
[00:18:29.781 --> 00:18:31.122]  You go get the red book to do that.
[00:18:31.202 --> 00:18:34.686]  I've read the red book before I use it as toilet paper.
[00:18:35.326 --> 00:18:38.429]  Oh, that'll get me banned in those Chinese classrooms they're listing right now.
[00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:43.054]  But a senior at UMass Dartmouth...
[00:18:44.548 --> 00:18:52.637]  Was visited by federal agents two months ago after he requested a copy of Mao Zedong's tome on communism called The Little Red Book.
[00:18:53.298 --> 00:19:05.252]  Two history professors at UMass Dartmouth, Brian Glenn Williams and Robert Portbride, said the student had told them he requested the book through the UMass Dartmouth Library Interlibrary Loan Program.
[00:19:06.201 --> 00:19:13.526]  The student who was completing a research paper on communism, Professor Portbrad's class on fascism and totalitarianism.
[00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:20.711]  Imagine, you're taking a class on fascism and totalitarianism, and you check out... I mean, I read Mein Kampf.
[00:19:21.392 --> 00:19:26.836]  I remember when I bought Mein Kampf for like $12 or something back when I was in college.
[00:19:28.677 --> 00:19:29.878]  Now, I was a senior in high school.
[00:19:29.898 --> 00:19:35.522]  I was visiting my cousin down in San Antonio, and I went to the B. Dalton Books...
[00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:42.451]  And I walked up, and I had this big orange Mein Kampf, my struggle, and the guy freaked out behind the counter.
[00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:44.631]  He thought he had a Nazi on his hand.
[00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:46.572]  You people are as dumb as dirt.
[00:19:47.652 --> 00:19:49.552]  I'm talking about those type of individuals.
[00:19:49.732 --> 00:19:54.394]  I mean, just because you read something... I've got the Satanic Bible.
[00:19:54.434 --> 00:19:55.834]  Does that mean I'm a Satanist?
[00:19:55.934 --> 00:19:56.654]  Absolutely not.
[00:19:56.694 --> 00:19:57.855]  Well, it's pointless.
[00:19:58.435 --> 00:19:59.055]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.075 --> 00:19:59.435]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.315 --> 00:20:02.735]  We're good to go.
[00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:45.147]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:20:45.367 --> 00:20:49.792]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:50.974]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:20:51.154 --> 00:20:52.776]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:54.698]  That's FilterMag.com.

[00:20:55.459 --> 00:20:55.639]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:21:04.116 --> 00:21:05.137]  The war on terrorism.
[00:21:05.477 --> 00:21:08.260]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:08.521 --> 00:21:12.685]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:13.946]  So what do you do?
[00:21:14.246 --> 00:21:18.851]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:21.454]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:22.795]  Sheltering in place.
[00:21:23.226 --> 00:21:36.618]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.291]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:55.651]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:21.713]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.254]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:25.534 --> 00:22:27.355]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:30.435]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.535 --> 00:22:33.196]  Here is reality.
[00:22:33.576 --> 00:22:37.157]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.637 --> 00:22:41.278]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.858 --> 00:22:44.699]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:22:46.027 --> 00:22:46.248]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:23:03.456 --> 00:23:06.917]  Government is best which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:07.357 --> 00:23:10.058]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:13.139]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:20.042]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:42.337]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:23:42.517 --> 00:23:42.857]  Have you?
[00:23:43.438 --> 00:23:44.940]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.144]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:23:49.164 --> 00:23:53.168]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:23:53.609 --> 00:23:54.670]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.411]  Osama bin forgotten.
[00:23:56.852 --> 00:24:00.496]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:24:20.327 --> 00:24:21.888]  Imagine you are a student.
[00:24:21.908 --> 00:24:23.149]  Imagine you are at a college.
[00:24:49.731 --> 00:25:03.760]  Imagine you're taking a political science class on fascism and totalitarianism, and they told the students, it's here in the article, I'm going to get some of these professors on, to go get those books.
[00:25:05.461 --> 00:25:11.064]  And so it says, although the Standard Times knows the name of the student, he is not coming forward because he fears repercussions.
[00:25:11.505 --> 00:25:15.147]  Should his name become public, he has not spoken to the Standard Times.
[00:25:16.437 --> 00:25:24.904]  And they ask a comment on the report that President Bush had authorized the National Security Agency to spy on as many as 500 people at any given time since 2002.
[00:25:25.304 --> 00:25:28.186]  In this country, the eavesdropping was apparently done without warrants.
[00:25:28.767 --> 00:25:34.271]  The little red book is a collection of quotations and speeches and excerpts from Chinese leader Mao Zedong.
[00:25:34.972 --> 00:25:40.036]  And then it just goes into how Homeland Security visited him to ask him if he was a terrorist.
[00:25:40.746 --> 00:25:44.987]  And then they told the paper that it was because he checked out this book.
[00:25:45.367 --> 00:25:47.608]  Now, folks, they do that on purpose.
[00:25:47.648 --> 00:25:52.709]  They visited a whole bunch of people that have checked out pretty innocuous stuff at the library.
[00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:56.670]  That's why there's so many wrinkles to this.
[00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.771]  I know that Bush is on television talking about spying on you for your own good.
[00:26:03.746 --> 00:26:08.848]  That they're in the newspaper every week admitting that they go look at what you read at the library.
[00:26:09.528 --> 00:26:12.269]  All of this is done to create a chilling effect.
[00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:23.833]  All of this is done to normalize absolute despotism in an Orwellian police state and then to equate it with keeping you safe.
[00:26:23.893 --> 00:26:33.256]  I mean, I listened to Bush's press conference this morning while I was getting ready for the radio show and it was just
[00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:49.706]  He probably said, I mean, count it up for yourself, in an hour press conference, he had to say, keep you safe, Al-Qaeda's very dangerous, keep you safe, keep you safe, we're in danger, keep you safe, I want to protect you, I care about you, oh, I think about you.
[00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:57.534]  He must have said that, he must have said, keep you safe, keep us safe, 60 times, probably more than that.
[00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:03.962]  I mean, he can give a 10-minute speech and it'll have the word liberty and freedom 30-something times and terrorist 50 times.
[00:27:03.982 --> 00:27:05.062]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:27:06.483 --> 00:27:14.047]  Remember in my film Martial Law, I took clips of Bush and a few other speeches where they say, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, we're in danger, terrorists.
[00:27:14.527 --> 00:27:16.788]  And people would email me and say, did you repeat any of those?
[00:27:16.808 --> 00:27:18.469]  Because it looked like you didn't repeat any of them.
[00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:19.610]  No, no, no.
[00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.732]  We had like... I took two days of the convention.
[00:27:23.752 --> 00:27:26.313]  It took every time they said terrorist, every time they said danger.
[00:27:26.893 --> 00:27:28.054]  And it was over a half hour.
[00:27:28.729 --> 00:27:30.409]  We just put three minutes of it in there.
[00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:31.630]  So no, it's the opposite.
[00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.810]  We didn't repeat any of what they said.
[00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.991]  We actually didn't put everything Giuliani said.
[00:27:37.911 --> 00:27:42.532]  The only speech we got close to showing every time they said terrorist was Giuliani.
[00:27:43.532 --> 00:27:45.493]  And we still didn't show all of what he said.
[00:27:46.233 --> 00:27:51.314]  I mean, it would have been 30 minutes plus of the film, just terrorist, terrorist, terrorist, terrorist, terrorist, terrorist, terrorist.
[00:27:51.694 --> 00:27:55.175]  I mean, in one speech, they'd say terrorist 50-something times.
[00:27:56.354 --> 00:27:57.874]  She's just drilling it into your head.
[00:27:57.914 --> 00:27:59.915]  The terrorists are going to get you.
[00:28:00.415 --> 00:28:03.536]  You are in danger if you do not let us run your life.
[00:28:06.037 --> 00:28:13.079]  And then I just want to point out that every time the NSA or Defense Intelligence did get on the heels of one of the terrorists, they were told to back off.
[00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:17.940]  Now that's on record, because this was part of a, quote, government operation.
[00:28:19.228 --> 00:28:23.330]  And I also want to point out what came out last week, what we told you about years ago.
[00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.771]  I mean, I don't have to tell you about it, about some news article.
[00:28:26.811 --> 00:28:27.772]  I've had it happen to me.
[00:28:28.412 --> 00:28:31.894]  Long before 9-11, folks, I had troops on top buildings videotaping me.
[00:28:33.354 --> 00:28:34.355]  And we've got video of it.
[00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:35.615]  We've put it on the sites and shown it.
[00:28:35.915 --> 00:28:39.817]  I mean, I've been in downtown Austin at a pro-Second Amendment rally, and there's U.S.
[00:28:39.897 --> 00:28:41.978]  Army in fatigues up on top of the building.
[00:28:43.619 --> 00:28:46.120]  Because their main mission is taking your guns, buddy.
[00:28:47.074 --> 00:28:50.897]  And believe me, a lot of these troops will follow orders and will come get your guns.
[00:28:50.937 --> 00:28:52.217]  They've been given questionnaires.
[00:28:52.518 --> 00:28:53.738]  They've been asked if they'll do it.
[00:28:53.858 --> 00:28:58.782]  So, I pray that Paul Watson or his brother will write a big article on this.
[00:28:58.822 --> 00:29:00.543]  I told him to tune in during the first hour.
[00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:02.444]  What we do is I kind of throw out my ideas.
[00:29:02.764 --> 00:29:03.505]  They listen to them.
[00:29:03.525 --> 00:29:05.486]  They put in their own information and we write articles.
[00:29:05.986 --> 00:29:09.188]  If not, I'm going to have to write a big article about this.
[00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:10.890]  The headline would be...
[00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:16.427]  They've always spied on us.
[00:29:16.447 --> 00:29:24.313]  And the sub-headline would be, environmental groups, second amendment groups, property rights groups, you've all had the Pentagon spy on you.
[00:29:24.573 --> 00:29:25.313]  And so what?
[00:29:25.353 --> 00:29:26.294]  We're the good guys.
[00:29:26.614 --> 00:29:27.815]  Let them spy on us.
[00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:29.456]  I'm not ashamed.
[00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:30.957]  In fact, something happens.
[00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:34.220]  They like to limit spying on people like me because I convert them.
[00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:36.843]  I convert the people that listen to this show.
[00:29:37.163 --> 00:29:40.986]  They go research what I'm saying, they find out it's all true, and they're on our side.
[00:29:41.566 --> 00:29:43.007]  Most of these people live in a little bubble.
[00:29:43.107 --> 00:29:44.168]  I pop those bubbles.
[00:29:44.629 --> 00:29:45.789]  We're the good guys!
[00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:52.314]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.815 --> 00:29:54.416]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.337 --> 00:29:58.019]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:02.398]  We're good to go.
[00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:27.364]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:30:27.624 --> 00:30:31.405]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:36.626]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:32:01.201 --> 00:32:04.563]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:05.143]  Why?
[00:32:05.163 --> 00:32:08.105]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:13.644]  For all of the listeners out there...
[00:33:32.705 --> 00:33:37.547]  You know, we go out on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave, and the satellite, but also the Internet.
[00:33:38.027 --> 00:33:49.451]  We have Internet listeners all over the world, and one of the main servers that the Genesis Network streams on has been overtaxed and overloaded because of the tens of thousands of people per hour trying to hit it.
[00:33:50.191 --> 00:33:53.992]  So I have added three separate streams.
[00:33:56.273 --> 00:33:57.813]  One is, what is it, 1700?
[00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.135]  And then another is 500 and another is 500.
[00:34:05.636 --> 00:34:08.579]  And those are on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:11.383]  And I get your emails, hundreds of them every day.
[00:34:11.403 --> 00:34:12.904]  Hey, your internet's cutting in and out.
[00:34:13.605 --> 00:34:20.514]  Well, folks, we've, since last week, have provided you with huge backup streams.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.362]  And then the network this week is adding a whole other server on top of it with even more streams.
[00:34:26.402 --> 00:34:37.685]  So basically, if you go to InfoWars.com, there are the network streams, but then there are all of my own streams that I'm paying for, that I'm supplying, because we will not be stopped here.
[00:34:38.685 --> 00:34:42.587]  And it's a good problem to have, more people wanting to come and overloading us.
[00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:46.748]  So if you go to InfoWars.com right now,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.031]  The original streams up there at the top have been replaced with my streams.
[00:34:52.492 --> 00:34:56.522]  And then if you click on that page and go to the sub page, there's a bunch of other streams.
[00:34:57.774 --> 00:35:01.778]  And there are a lot of other streams out there on the web that feed off of us.
[00:35:01.818 --> 00:35:03.580]  The problem is they've been feeding off the network.
[00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:05.302]  I guess they call them clusters.
[00:35:05.342 --> 00:35:07.965]  They go get a stream from the network, then they duplicate it.
[00:35:08.725 --> 00:35:15.492]  But they've been having problems because the Mothership streams have been not cutting out a lot during my show.
[00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:17.474]  No problems during other broadcasts.
[00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:20.858]  But during my show, because of the phenomenal listenership,
[00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:26.817]  It's been laboring and sputtering, and I'd say we're down about 20 minutes every three hours.
[00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:27.998]  Every day.
[00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:32.720]  Maybe a 10-minute outage and a 2-minute outage and a 4-minute outage and another 2-minute outage.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.501]  It's around 20 minutes every day.
[00:35:34.901 --> 00:35:39.523]  So I just added a bunch of my own streams, and they're all there at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:40.124 --> 00:35:43.225]  So seriously, move over to those streams.
[00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:49.008]  Move over to those streams right now so you can listen to the show.
[00:35:49.028 --> 00:35:50.369]  It's my dime.
[00:35:50.449 --> 00:35:50.929]  Enjoy it.
[00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:52.961]  I want you to get the information.
[00:35:53.001 --> 00:35:53.782]  I want you to have it.
[00:35:54.722 --> 00:35:56.762]  Those streams are there for you.
[00:35:57.223 --> 00:36:03.724]  And we're going to keep those streams up after the network even puts up more streams, which will be in the next few days, and then we're going to have those streams as well.
[00:36:04.325 --> 00:36:16.848]  We'll just have a giant page of streams, a giant page of links for you with big, gigantic, I guess, fire hoses of information right there for you.
[00:36:20.137 --> 00:36:23.018]  I'm honored and blessed that so many of you want to listen to the show.
[00:36:23.058 --> 00:36:32.460]  You know, routinely, out of 3,500 networks and radio shows around the country, our streams, my streams, are number one on Shoutcast.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.340]  I mean, let's say the network's got five streams.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:42.442]  One of our streams is number one, then one of the other streams is number four, and then another stream is number ten, and another stream is, you know, in the ratings.
[00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:44.440]  I think we're good to go.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.781]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.831]  And then you still complain, though, when that stream doesn't work, which I understand is frustrating.
[00:37:09.171 --> 00:37:11.412]  Maybe you didn't get the memo, but here it is.
[00:37:12.032 --> 00:37:15.313]  We have added mucho grande streams.
[00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:27.877]  We have added a plethora, a cornucopia, a flotilla, a squadron, a centurion of streams there for you.
[00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:29.918]  Mega, mega streams.
[00:37:31.158 --> 00:37:32.059]  That is obnoxious.
[00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:32.539]  I know it is.
[00:37:33.476 --> 00:37:37.501]  All right, look, I know we've got calls rolling in here, and we will get to your calls.
[00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.685]  Jason in Phoenix and Eric in California and many others.
[00:37:40.705 --> 00:37:42.527]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:37:42.547 --> 00:37:45.631]  But I need to play some clips of the lies that have been...
[00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:59.277]  Vomited forth by these big government anti-gun, anti-constitution promoting pimps that have fooled the general public into believing they're conservative.
[00:37:59.678 --> 00:38:01.879]  By the way, the Democrats are working with them hungrily.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:10.705]  I believe in my guts they're letting the Patriot Act fail for now so that when they carry out a terror attack, they can say, see, it's your fault.
[00:38:11.025 --> 00:38:12.967]  You kept us from keeping you safe.
[00:38:13.027 --> 00:38:19.531]  Now we don't ever want to hear any of you criticize police state legislation we passed.
[00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:27.313]  And I've heard neocons, who've definitely gotten the memo, bragging, you just wait till there's another attack, you liberals.
[00:38:27.573 --> 00:38:29.553]  You're going in forced labor camps.
[00:38:29.873 --> 00:38:35.095]  You go ahead and beat the Patriot Act, and then when something happens, it's going to be your fault.
[00:38:35.575 --> 00:38:37.555]  You see, why do they need that to happen?
[00:38:37.575 --> 00:38:40.096]  Because if the globalists carry out another terror attack right now,
[00:38:41.576 --> 00:38:46.020]  People say, hey, you had these powers, and it caused an attack to take place.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.503]  And then their argument will be, yeah, see, we need even more power.
[00:38:50.043 --> 00:38:51.925]  Which, that will probably still work for them.
[00:38:52.947 --> 00:39:05.310]  But what'll really work is if for a few months they can say, oh, we don't have this power, oh, we're blind, there's nothing we can do, and then the city gets hit by a nuke, by an A-bomb.
[00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:14.372]  Or then the deadly biological gets released, and Rumsfeld, don't worry, we'll have the cure for you at $500 per pill, of course, and no one will put two and two together.
[00:39:14.872 --> 00:39:21.114]  Just like with the anthrax, publicly sent by the White House, now that's official, so let's just ignore it.
[00:39:22.831 --> 00:39:24.672]  And so this is for all the marbles.
[00:39:25.292 --> 00:39:34.155]  You see, the economy's in trouble, all this stuff's happening, this New Order agenda is almost complete, but right here at the end, they're getting a lot of resistance from all over the planet.
[00:39:34.255 --> 00:39:36.675]  They need to really bully us into submission.
[00:39:37.276 --> 00:39:47.439]  And so I see them letting this Patriot Act fail, because the Senate is always more evil in the House, always more conniving, always more political, more controlled by the globalists.
[00:39:49.418 --> 00:39:53.741]  And so the House of Representatives right now, they passed it, no problem.
[00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:57.703]  The Senate has passed it before and sent it back down to conference, but it's failed in the House.
[00:39:58.063 --> 00:40:01.505]  Now, magically, it passes in the House, but it can't pass in the Senate.
[00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:06.248]  And that wasn't just in a filibuster, that was in a vote.
[00:40:06.388 --> 00:40:08.949]  And it'd be easy to say, oh, that was our phone calls.
[00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:10.870]  Our phone calls caused that to happen.
[00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.892]  No, I see right through this ruse.
[00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:14.913]  You're not going to fool me.
[00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:17.377]  It just fits the MO.
[00:40:17.437 --> 00:40:21.620]  And right on time, somebody leaks that Bush is spying on you.
[00:40:22.761 --> 00:40:26.564]  But it's a limited leak about spying on international phone calls.
[00:40:27.785 --> 00:40:40.076]  There were best-selling books off declassified NSA documents written in the mid-'90s where they admit that millions of us a day have roving NSA keyword software listening.
[00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.271]  I mean, that's declassified.
[00:40:42.291 --> 00:40:44.213]  See, ooh, the New York Times broke it.
[00:40:44.273 --> 00:40:45.214]  Newsweek broke it.
[00:40:45.414 --> 00:40:58.327]  The Washington Post has broke it that there's a thing called the NSA, the National Security Agency, and they listened to some people because Bush wanted to stop terrorists because he really cared about you.
[00:40:59.108 --> 00:41:05.594]  And then, see, he gets to then go out and grandstand and, oh, he's in trouble, he's down, but, oh, he did it to keep us safe.
[00:41:07.014 --> 00:41:11.140]  Oh, well, I guess the NSA spying on me is okay if it's to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:11.481 --> 00:41:15.406]  That's because they're getting ready to use it publicly on a daily basis.
[00:41:15.947 --> 00:41:18.310]  Now they've got to announce their use of it.
[00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.172]  That's all this is.
[00:41:19.412 --> 00:41:20.634]  This is their coming out.
[00:41:21.275 --> 00:41:22.717]  And it's Bush's job.
[00:41:22.757 --> 00:41:23.999]  It's Clinton's job.
[00:41:24.059 --> 00:41:25.340]  It's Hillary's job.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:31.628]  It's Ronald Reagan's job to come out and get blamed and take the heat and fall on their swords.
[00:41:31.668 --> 00:41:36.134]  And then, like a phoenix, the New World Order media regenerates them the next day.
[00:41:36.475 --> 00:41:38.858]  And oh, they did it for your own good.
[00:41:39.574 --> 00:41:41.635]  You know, they have the big dove, Colin Powell.
[00:41:41.895 --> 00:41:46.177]  He's against the war, but on the day of the war, actually, I'm for the war.
[00:41:46.357 --> 00:41:47.077]  I was wrong.
[00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.278]  Oh, he's the guy who was against it.
[00:41:49.338 --> 00:41:50.339]  We can believe him.
[00:41:50.359 --> 00:41:53.020]  And then now he's back defending Bush over the weekend.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.621]  Oh, we really thought the intelligence was real.
[00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:59.083]  It wasn't, but we thought it was, and Saddam was still a threat.
[00:41:59.363 --> 00:42:02.324]  So, see, even the guy that blew the whistle, he still agrees with Bush.
[00:42:02.664 --> 00:42:05.206]  You see, they create these false debates.
[00:42:05.226 --> 00:42:07.126]  They're using psychology.
[00:42:07.206 --> 00:42:07.987]  Con man...
[00:42:09.508 --> 00:42:15.093]  Good cop, bad cop.
[00:42:15.614 --> 00:42:32.610]  They know there has to be a theater, a synthesis, a gladiatorial event to divert you and to distract you and to make you think that there's some type of division of power up there, to make you think there's a revolution going on, so you won't get involved in a real revolution to bring America back from the brink.
[00:42:35.114 --> 00:42:36.495]  And then it just gets ridiculous.
[00:42:37.175 --> 00:42:42.258]  Gonzalez saying that he's doing this to keep us safe, and that it just signals intelligence.
[00:42:43.699 --> 00:42:55.485]  There has never been a bar on the National Security Agency, or what I call the Echelon Group, which is England, the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, those five countries.
[00:42:59.452 --> 00:43:00.553]  What happens is the U.S.
[00:43:00.593 --> 00:43:12.720]  spies on England, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, for them, then they all spy on us, and we have officers on loan in their echelon offices listening to our phone calls.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.881]  Now, this has all been public.
[00:43:13.901 --> 00:43:16.242]  This has been public for 15 years.
[00:43:18.784 --> 00:43:19.504]  This is admitted.
[00:43:20.145 --> 00:43:23.287]  And then that's all relayed back as signals intelligence.
[00:43:23.327 --> 00:43:26.709]  So what Gonzalez is saying in a sick way is true.
[00:43:27.851 --> 00:43:29.532]  But it's always been going on.
[00:43:29.972 --> 00:43:35.354]  And then in turn, those countries all have laws against being spied on by their own government, so they have the U.S.
[00:43:35.394 --> 00:43:35.654]  do it.
[00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:43.457]  Which then gets into the old system of how Stalin would send people from the east to the west, or from the north to the south.
[00:43:43.497 --> 00:43:47.418]  You never let soldiers from their own area abuse their own people.
[00:43:48.298 --> 00:43:49.759]  At least in the beginning of a tyranny.
[00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:53.960]  So they have foreigners spying on us.
[00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:55.101]  Oh great, even worse.
[00:43:56.184 --> 00:43:56.544]  You see?
[00:43:56.845 --> 00:43:59.326]  But now, they're getting rid of even that convention.
[00:44:00.067 --> 00:44:03.169]  And, so see, this is the global government, folks.
[00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:05.791]  I mean, we have Head Start.
[00:44:05.851 --> 00:44:07.612]  In England, it's called Secure Start.
[00:44:08.013 --> 00:44:09.854]  In what in Australia, it's called Good Start.
[00:44:10.603 --> 00:44:16.807]  We even have the same education programs, the same names of the drugs, the same names of government agencies.
[00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:23.151]  When a program comes out here, the exact same program with maybe the same name or a little different comes out there.
[00:44:23.231 --> 00:44:26.313]  It's all run by the bureaucracies, by the big private banks.
[00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:28.114]  We have a global government.
[00:44:29.855 --> 00:44:40.142]  And it's these five countries teamed up together that are really owned by Europe, and they use us as their little bullies to go around spying and attacking and killing everybody.
[00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:46.738]  And now the globalists went, and they cooked up a bunch of Arab terrorists.
[00:44:46.778 --> 00:44:48.779]  Brzezinski even brags about it back in the 70s.
[00:44:49.299 --> 00:44:52.681]  And then now they get to use them for whatever operation they want.
[00:44:54.342 --> 00:44:56.142]  And we sit here at the point of the sword.
[00:44:58.063 --> 00:45:00.604]  Let's go ahead and play Alberto Gonzalez on MSNBC.
[00:45:00.644 --> 00:45:02.505]  Here he is, being questioned.
[00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:08.855]  About the spying, and he just tells us it's absolutely wonderful and it's no big deal.
[00:45:09.095 --> 00:45:10.837]  Now, again, we all knew this was already happening.
[00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:14.980]  There'll be Pulitzer Prizes for the New York Times, how they broke the news.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.202]  Their government ops broke the news.
[00:45:18.242 --> 00:45:22.005]  They break it in a whitewashed manner to actually sell it to you.
[00:45:22.045 --> 00:45:23.947]  See, now they're really getting ready to really expand it.
[00:45:24.207 --> 00:45:25.568]  So now it's the coming out.
[00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:30.664]  Coming out, it's like the New York Times writes an article that they discovered the sun.
[00:45:30.844 --> 00:45:33.865]  What's that big, big orange thing that comes up in the morning?
[00:45:33.885 --> 00:45:36.145]  Well, the New York Times has discovered it.
[00:45:36.346 --> 00:45:38.246]  We're absolutely incredible.
[00:45:38.266 --> 00:45:42.047]  Then they put their spit on it and tell us it's a big egg frying up in the sky.
[00:45:42.447 --> 00:45:46.088]  Whereas on this show, we tell you it's a giant ball of gas.
[00:45:46.768 --> 00:45:47.770]  We're good to go.
[00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:48.090]  I think?
[00:46:07.188 --> 00:46:12.190]  Because his high school class is taking photos of architecture for their photography class.
[00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.351]  And the FBI knows why they're doing that.
[00:46:15.371 --> 00:46:16.371]  The guys doing it don't.
[00:46:16.571 --> 00:46:24.574]  But when they give them an order nationwide to go harass high schoolers and college students, it's to set the precedent that these agents go around questioning people.
[00:46:24.834 --> 00:46:26.495]  They go question toy store owners.
[00:46:26.875 --> 00:46:30.636]  Because if you can go question a toy store owner over a Rubik's Cube...
[00:46:31.343 --> 00:46:33.224]  Then you can question them over anything.
[00:46:33.425 --> 00:46:41.911]  If you can go arrest people at a topless bar over a $4,000 payoff to get zoning for more parking spaces, then baby, you can use the Patriot Act on anything.
[00:46:43.692 --> 00:46:44.873]  You see how they do this?
[00:46:45.733 --> 00:46:46.554]  Just, they're evil.
[00:46:47.374 --> 00:46:48.755]  And they're smart creatures, too.
[00:46:48.816 --> 00:46:50.437]  Let's go ahead and roll Gonzalez.
[00:46:51.477 --> 00:46:59.103]  Does the President have to avoid the normal process of obtaining court-approved search warrants before eavesdropping is conducted?
[00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:18.232]  Katie, we believe the President has inherent authority as Commander-in-Chief under the Constitution to engage in signal intelligence of our enemy, but we also believe that the President has the authority under the Authorization of the Used Military Force, which was passed by the Congress just days after the attacks of 9-11.
[00:47:19.012 --> 00:47:29.277]  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does require a court order to engage in the kind of electronic surveillance the President talked about on Saturday, except as otherwise authorized by statute.
[00:47:29.757 --> 00:47:41.842]  We believe that authorization to use military force constitutes that statute which does give permission for the President of the United States to engage in this kind of very limited, targeted electronic surveillance against our enemies.
[00:47:41.902 --> 00:47:49.405]  Well, apparently some members of Congress disagree with you because there's been an outcry even in the President's own party about this.
[00:47:49.465 --> 00:47:54.867]  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Arlen Specter are calling for hearings on this.
[00:47:54.927 --> 00:47:59.309]  Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Russell Feingold, we'll hear from him momentarily this morning.
[00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:00.510]  Let's just stop it right there.
[00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.431]  Maybe later we'll play the second part of the clip.
[00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:04.392]  But this is the guy who wrote memos.
[00:48:04.432 --> 00:48:05.873]  We have copies of four of them.
[00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:22.422]  They're on Infowars.com right now, where he actually says Bush is the source of all law, where he actually says that Bush is the law, and that if they can kill people, torture them to death, and just don't call it torture, it's okay.
[00:48:25.262 --> 00:48:27.382]  Where he describes pulling fingernails out.
[00:48:27.782 --> 00:48:30.803]  Where he describes tabling, sticking your head in the bucket.
[00:48:31.843 --> 00:48:37.924]  All of this, just Joseph Mengele, you know, the Nazis folks would not put stuff down on paper.
[00:48:38.144 --> 00:48:39.325]  They were smart enough not to do that.
[00:48:39.725 --> 00:48:40.305]  They hid it.
[00:48:40.645 --> 00:48:41.765]  They were ashamed of it.
[00:48:41.845 --> 00:48:42.945]  Not America, baby.
[00:48:43.345 --> 00:48:44.646]  We've hit new lows.
[00:48:47.046 --> 00:48:49.886]  And Gonzalez said he vehemently believes in war gun control.
[00:48:49.906 --> 00:48:51.127]  He wants an assault weapons ban.
[00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:52.747]  He wants many types of ammo banned.
[00:48:53.436 --> 00:49:01.640]  They've doubled the size of the BATF, and man, I've actually been called a liberal because I've actually heard neocons calling and go, maybe we should have some gun control.
[00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:04.102]  You see, if they say it's conservative, it is.
[00:49:05.563 --> 00:49:08.384]  This guy's a member of MECHA, a Mexican supremacist group.
[00:49:09.265 --> 00:49:09.825]  They love it.
[00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:11.326]  Conservatives love it.
[00:49:11.486 --> 00:49:12.146]  You're scum.
[00:49:12.226 --> 00:49:12.686]  That's why.
[00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:13.687]  You're scum.
[00:49:14.748 --> 00:49:20.631]  I'm talking about the so-called conservatives that aren't really conservatives who just think killing this country is cute.
[00:49:21.111 --> 00:49:22.192]  Well, let me just tell you something.
[00:49:22.212 --> 00:49:22.872]  It isn't cute.
[00:49:24.617 --> 00:49:37.080]  And now the neocons will get up and go, well, I don't like spying on the American people, but I tell you, I tell you, 3,000 people died, and I just can't, you're going to hear this all day, all week, I just, we've just got to say, some kids died in those buildings.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.120]  I even heard it this morning.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.481]  I don't even know what to say anymore to this.
[00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:48.222]  They've been spying on us forever.
[00:49:51.002 --> 00:49:54.183]  The military has been spying on us forever.
[00:49:55.447 --> 00:49:56.868]  Forever.
[00:49:58.449 --> 00:50:00.110]  They have never stopped.
[00:50:00.891 --> 00:50:05.114]  They have tried to create the cadres that will follow the orders to confiscate our guns.
[00:50:05.214 --> 00:50:13.100]  I've been to the urban warfare training drills where they're training to take your guns.
[00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:21.887]  And listen, they're not going to start you off with the military's training to take your guns and break your family up and put you in forced labor camps.
[00:50:22.547 --> 00:50:23.748]  They're not going to start you out with that.
[00:50:24.901 --> 00:50:28.084]  They're going to start you out with this, oh, we need the Patriot Act to keep you safe.
[00:50:28.144 --> 00:50:30.206]  Oh, we need the Army to watch you.
[00:50:30.226 --> 00:50:33.529]  We need the Army to come out to your local Greenpeace rally.
[00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:36.892]  We need the Army to come out to your local land rights group, conservative-liberal.
[00:50:37.433 --> 00:50:38.734]  Well, it's okay.
[00:50:38.774 --> 00:50:40.015]  They spy on both parties.
[00:50:41.377 --> 00:50:44.079]  Well, we're authorized by these war powers.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.101]  You see, did you hear Gonzalez?
[00:50:46.121 --> 00:50:46.982]  That's admiralty.
[00:50:47.262 --> 00:50:48.984]  That's the 33 War Powers Act.
[00:50:50.166 --> 00:50:52.327]  No, you're not authorized to declare yourself dictator.
[00:50:52.487 --> 00:50:54.809]  You're not authorized to say you can torture people to death.
[00:50:56.169 --> 00:50:57.090]  You piece of trash.
[00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:57.970]  You scumbag.
[00:51:02.573 --> 00:51:05.414]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.675 --> 00:51:06.375]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.475 --> 00:51:07.235]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.596 --> 00:51:12.258]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.618 --> 00:51:19.342]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.662 --> 00:51:21.643]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.844 --> 00:51:24.686]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.786 --> 00:51:29.449]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.649 --> 00:51:34.052]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.292 --> 00:51:41.517]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.777 --> 00:51:44.199]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.359 --> 00:51:46.100]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:01.812 --> 00:52:08.036]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.196 --> 00:52:14.359]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:23.085]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.325 --> 00:52:30.349]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.649 --> 00:52:35.472]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.672 --> 00:52:41.096]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.436 --> 00:52:44.498]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:52.804]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.844 --> 00:52:53.424]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.112 --> 00:53:09.040]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.523]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.723 --> 00:53:18.091]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.451 --> 00:53:19.071]  I think so too.
[00:53:33.959 --> 00:53:34.359]  We're good to go.
[00:54:05.902 --> 00:54:07.782]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.283 --> 00:54:11.143]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.964 --> 00:54:22.366]  Coming up in the third hour, I've got Wayne Madsen, who worked at the National Security Agency, coming on the show.
[00:54:22.546 --> 00:54:27.207]  And he said last time he was on that when he was there in the 80s and early 90s,
[00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:37.953]  If he would have seen the type of stuff our government's doing, he would have thought a fifth column had taken it over and was trying to destroy it and trying to make us look bad and trying to loot the economy.
[00:54:38.413 --> 00:54:43.915]  Do you understand that George Bush has spent more money than all other presidents combined?
[00:54:44.376 --> 00:54:46.056]  And only a tiny fraction of that.
[00:54:46.236 --> 00:54:48.617]  Some people go, well, that's to fight terrorists.
[00:54:48.757 --> 00:54:49.098]  No, no, no.
[00:54:49.238 --> 00:54:52.259]  About 10% of all that is this stupid war.
[00:54:52.279 --> 00:54:57.121]  I mean, he's taken every big government agency and ballooning them.
[00:54:58.078 --> 00:54:59.379]  Doubling is the average.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:01.521]  That's not true.
[00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:04.222]  A year ago, for the first four years, it was a doubling.
[00:55:04.283 --> 00:55:09.406]  Now he's trying to even outpace that trend with even more than a doubling.
[00:55:10.047 --> 00:55:12.108]  I mean, it's just the end of the country.
[00:55:12.488 --> 00:55:21.415]  And I demand... You know, I went to a local real estate lawyer, and I was in his office, and I was needing him to do something for me.
[00:55:22.035 --> 00:55:27.519]  And he's like, Alex Jones, I didn't realize when I agreed to have you in here, basically who you are,
[00:55:29.787 --> 00:55:31.290]  But now I realize that I've got to go.
[00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:33.235]  The guy wouldn't even render me a service.
[00:55:33.856 --> 00:55:36.462]  And then it turns out, of course, he's a military guy and all this.
[00:55:36.723 --> 00:55:38.367]  He sees me as a traitor.
[00:55:39.634 --> 00:55:43.495]  To just show people on the street, quiet people like that, who will do anything.
[00:55:43.555 --> 00:55:47.416]  Folks, if the government tells them to line you and your kids up and shoot you, they'll do it, okay?
[00:55:47.596 --> 00:55:48.577]  It'll be to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:48.597 --> 00:55:49.277]  Do you understand that?
[00:55:49.497 --> 00:55:52.458]  They're never going to wake up to the fact the government's been taken over.
[00:55:52.738 --> 00:55:56.159]  They're never going to wake up to the fact that it's a new world order.
[00:55:56.399 --> 00:55:59.500]  They're never going to wake up to any of this.
[00:56:01.521 --> 00:56:09.308]  Bush could sprout horns and big black fangs and start vomiting acid and scream, I am King Kong Satan incarnate.
[00:56:09.828 --> 00:56:13.431]  And they would bow down and worship him.
[00:56:13.751 --> 00:56:15.533]  It's like people that worship Bill Clinton.
[00:56:15.793 --> 00:56:17.234]  You weren't going to get through to them.
[00:56:17.314 --> 00:56:18.535]  You can't get through to them.
[00:56:18.715 --> 00:56:19.936]  There's no getting through to them.
[00:56:20.617 --> 00:56:22.779]  I know we've got a load of phone lines and all these great callers.
[00:56:25.367 --> 00:56:30.216]  I didn't make 10% of the points, 5% of the points I wanted to make watching these speeches.
[00:56:30.276 --> 00:56:31.739]  It just makes my blood boil.
[00:56:31.779 --> 00:56:36.367]  It's all twisted, baloney propaganda written up by propagandists.
[00:56:37.523 --> 00:56:38.164]  It's that simple.
[00:56:38.404 --> 00:56:41.926]  They're just announcing to you that the military is going to watch you and run your life.
[00:56:42.206 --> 00:56:47.970]  Oh, and by the way, we're going to have TSA teams on all the major roads and highways shaking you down and demanding to see your IDs.
[00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.472]  Your whole life will be like the airport now.
[00:56:50.872 --> 00:56:55.135]  Oh, and by the way, we need to get rid of Posse Comitatus and have troops fighting terrorists and crime.
[00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:59.478]  Oh, we need local neighborhood watch under the Pentagon's control fighting terrorists.
[00:56:59.578 --> 00:57:00.518]  Oh, there's no terrorists.
[00:57:00.538 --> 00:57:02.099]  Well, we need you to fight crime then.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.881]  Crime funds the terrorists.
[00:57:04.141 --> 00:57:05.702]  Oh, here, let's build some more prisons.
[00:57:05.842 --> 00:57:07.363]  Here, let's build more prisons everywhere.
[00:57:07.843 --> 00:57:16.085]  Oh, here, let's go send the military out to question all the college students and the FBI out and Homeland Security out.
[00:57:16.405 --> 00:57:20.106]  Oh, a doctor called and complained at the VA about bad treatment.
[00:57:20.306 --> 00:57:24.847]  He didn't threaten anybody, but still calling is terrorism, so we're arresting him.
[00:57:25.847 --> 00:57:27.607]  They actually said that in the Quad City Times.
[00:57:27.767 --> 00:57:29.207]  Well, he didn't threaten anybody.
[00:57:30.428 --> 00:57:36.649]  Dr. Tennant didn't threaten anybody, but he called too much, and so we're arresting him and charging him as a terrorist.
[00:57:37.532 --> 00:57:38.272]  Quad City Times.
[00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.693]  You see, and then Bush gets up there on TV.
[00:57:41.913 --> 00:57:44.174]  We're not using this against anybody.
[00:57:44.774 --> 00:57:45.174]  We're not.
[00:57:45.354 --> 00:57:46.874]  This is to fight terrorists.
[00:57:46.934 --> 00:57:57.337]  This is to, I mean, and then out in the open every day, I've got them going to people that check out books at libraries, people that are selling toys, people, topless bars, pot dealers.
[00:57:58.137 --> 00:58:00.459]  Homeless people sleeping on the side of the road.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.441]  I'm swimming in it.
[00:58:03.001 --> 00:58:05.903]  I've had troops following me around, taking pictures of me.
[00:58:06.143 --> 00:58:07.384]  I've got video of it.
[00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:08.765]  I've confronted them.
[00:58:08.966 --> 00:58:10.246]  I've put it on the website.
[00:58:10.667 --> 00:58:15.470]  I have troops training to take your guns and break your family up.
[00:58:15.851 --> 00:58:18.453]  I made a film six years ago.
[00:58:18.673 --> 00:58:20.314]  It's called Police State 2000.
[00:58:21.375 --> 00:58:22.316]  I've been there.
[00:58:22.596 --> 00:58:23.416]  I've seen them.
[00:58:23.436 --> 00:58:25.338]  They're training to come for us.
[00:58:26.315 --> 00:58:29.457]  And all they're doing is conditioning us to use them against us.
[00:58:29.698 --> 00:58:30.959]  They've got to broach it.
[00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:32.540]  They've got to bring it out.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.341]  And that's what they're doing right now.
[00:58:34.381 --> 00:58:35.482]  They're broaching it.
[00:58:36.583 --> 00:58:37.904]  We'll come back and take calls.
[00:58:37.944 --> 00:58:38.784]  I'm really angry now.
[00:58:57.839 --> 00:58:58.480]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:00.201]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.902 --> 00:59:02.003]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.663 --> 00:59:03.484]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.244 --> 00:59:05.125]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.145 --> 00:59:09.568]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.989 --> 00:59:14.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.853 --> 00:59:20.477]  ...information, a big report on the economy and some of the key indicators and indices...
[00:59:21.505 --> 00:59:23.106]  Precious Metals, you name it, coming up.
[00:59:23.146 --> 00:59:26.967]  Wayne Madsen, former NSA, to talk about all the NSA spying.
[00:59:27.007 --> 00:59:31.008]  What you're hearing about in the news is one one-millionth of the truth.
[00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:33.189]  Literally.
[00:59:33.489 --> 00:59:37.190]  And let's go, I mean, 500 people being spied on is one one-millionth.
[00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:39.691]  But even in this story, guess who they're spying on?
[00:59:39.731 --> 00:59:43.452]  The ambassador is spying on politicians.
[00:59:45.299 --> 00:59:48.100]  I mean, it's like Bill Clinton opened up some of the FBI files.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.200]  It was horrible when he did it.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.380]  Bush has just opened them all up.
[00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:54.681]  It's been unlimited hog-monstering in there.
[00:59:54.701 --> 00:59:56.322]  All right, that's enough.
[00:59:56.842 --> 01:00:00.463]  Jason in Phoenix, Arizona, you've been holding like a trooper.
[01:00:00.503 --> 01:00:00.803]  Welcome.
[01:00:01.563 --> 01:00:01.723]  Thanks.
[01:00:01.803 --> 01:00:02.743]  I just have a question.
[01:00:02.803 --> 01:00:13.586]  I mean, this whole thing has been steaming deep for the last 15 years, and I saw it coming, and when I discovered you, it was like, well, finally somebody who's out there saying it.
[01:00:15.016 --> 01:00:26.629]  My question is, what are the people going to do when they finally get the guns out of our hands and the military troops patrol the streets and you have to go through daily checkpoints to get from A to B?
[01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:29.546]  And show your papers.
[01:00:29.566 --> 01:00:30.907]  Is this their idea?
[01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:33.388]  A lot of it's going to be like a U2 football game.
[01:00:33.409 --> 01:00:36.010]  There's going to be stickers on the cars that you supported.
[01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:39.011]  There'll be families that break up over it.
[01:00:39.732 --> 01:00:43.174]  You'll say to your daughter, please don't go out with that stormtrooper.
[01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:43.874]  Shut up!
[01:00:43.994 --> 01:00:45.355]  I'm for the wreck and you're not!
[01:00:45.615 --> 01:00:46.816]  I'm reporting you!
[01:00:47.516 --> 01:00:48.877]  And that's what we're going to face.
[01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.277]  It's just going to be worship of it.
[01:00:50.477 --> 01:00:51.978]  Most of these cowards are going to hooray for it.
[01:00:54.945 --> 01:00:58.510]  Most of these scum would let them take their own children.
[01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:09.746]  My girlfriend is German, and she's from Germany, and they see what's happening to America so clearly as what Hitler did, and she cannot understand.
[01:01:10.273 --> 01:01:13.115]  How the American people in general are just so stupid.
[01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:14.356]  I mean, how could you not?
[01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:18.298]  The same black uniforms, the same terms, homeland, Reichland.
[01:01:18.318 --> 01:01:20.140]  I mean, it just never ends.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.280]  She just shakes her head.
[01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:26.344]  And they show news over there, what Bush says, that they'll never show over here.
[01:01:26.444 --> 01:01:27.685]  I noticed it when I was over there.
[01:01:27.705 --> 01:01:29.125]  It's a blackout.
[01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:29.766]  It is a blackout.
[01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:32.831]  Well, take care of that good Freud line you got.
[01:01:33.432 --> 01:01:40.196]  I found Russians, Chinese, Germans, people that have lived under tyranny are just Greeks.
[01:01:40.216 --> 01:01:43.719]  I mean, people that have seen it are like totally Africans.
[01:01:43.759 --> 01:01:44.699]  They totally resonate.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.520]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.521]  Oh, yes, we know.
[01:01:46.921 --> 01:01:47.401]  Oh, yes.
[01:01:47.742 --> 01:01:48.982]  And they're very astute.
[01:01:49.022 --> 01:01:50.644]  We're just fat, dumb, and happy, man.
[01:01:51.204 --> 01:01:58.309]  We just think, you know, we don't understand that this monster is rising right two inches in front of our snouts.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.085]  I mean, it's just the classical monster building right in front of us, and we have an attorney general.
[01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:11.687]  He's the head law enforcement officer saying Bush is above the law.
[01:02:11.747 --> 01:02:14.389]  He actually says Bush is above the law.
[01:02:14.849 --> 01:02:16.910]  Bush is held at a higher standard.
[01:02:19.972 --> 01:02:22.894]  And then you hear these sickos on the radio going, good, torture people.
[01:02:23.195 --> 01:02:24.495]  Folks, we're talking about children.
[01:02:25.016 --> 01:02:28.398]  I instructed my webmaster today to put a picture of dead kids on the website.
[01:02:29.638 --> 01:02:35.840]  I mean, these people talking about how they want to kill kids, they need to at least look at what they've supported and what they're a part of.
[01:02:37.501 --> 01:02:38.842]  Thanks for the call, Jason.
[01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:40.682]  Listen, I don't want that on me.
[01:02:41.363 --> 01:02:42.723]  Man, I don't want it on my soul.
[01:02:42.803 --> 01:02:48.045]  I'd rather the New World Order kill me right now than have all these dead kids on my soul.
[01:02:48.425 --> 01:02:50.366]  I don't want the dead abortions on my soul.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.761]  I don't want all these dead Iraqi kids on my soul.
[01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:56.502]  Keep it away from my soul, because I got a soul.
[01:02:56.862 --> 01:02:58.042]  I know I got a soul.
[01:02:58.382 --> 01:02:59.603]  I'll always have a soul.
[01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.143]  I can feel my soul.
[01:03:01.523 --> 01:03:04.664]  And my soul's on fire to fight this baloney.
[01:03:06.445 --> 01:03:07.545]  You know, I got a fever today.
[01:03:07.565 --> 01:03:08.285]  I'm sick today.
[01:03:08.305 --> 01:03:10.066]  I'm literally and figuratively burning up.
[01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.366]  But I came in here.
[01:03:13.287 --> 01:03:15.747]  I came in here because I am so mad.
[01:03:15.767 --> 01:03:17.468]  I'm laying in bed yesterday.
[01:03:19.145 --> 01:03:24.288]  And watching Bush on TV sit up there and just spout his baloney.
[01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.672]  We've got a very important guest coming up, and we'll go to your calls early, I promise.
[01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:33.314]  Eric and Emmett and Eric and a bunch of Erics.
[01:03:35.075 --> 01:03:39.218]  Eric in California, Eric in Connecticut, Eric in Dallas, Eric and Emmett and others.
[01:03:39.238 --> 01:03:39.458]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:39.478 --> 01:03:40.238]  I had to get that rant out.
[01:03:43.738 --> 01:03:44.580]  In the first hour.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.484]  In the third hour, I'm going back into all the spying and the rest of it.
[01:03:47.784 --> 01:03:49.607]  But again, just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:03:49.947 --> 01:03:51.350]  Just a sliver of the iceberg.
[01:03:53.504 --> 01:03:54.985]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.186 --> 01:03:58.288]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.408 --> 01:04:02.312]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:06.595]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.936 --> 01:04:10.719]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.819 --> 01:04:12.741]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.861 --> 01:04:16.164]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.204 --> 01:04:17.305]  The medical bills...
[01:04:18.906 --> 01:04:20.948]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.068 --> 01:04:24.110]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:27.173]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.634 --> 01:04:33.779]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.279 --> 01:04:35.000]  We're good to go.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:35.500]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.223 --> 01:05:01.849]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:13.338]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.558 --> 01:05:16.180]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:23.007]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:23.167 --> 01:05:25.030]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:31.256]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.517 --> 01:05:37.183]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:37.503 --> 01:05:41.429]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.449 --> 01:05:42.151]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:42.872]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.665 --> 01:05:56.267]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.130]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:01.294]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.735 --> 01:06:04.378]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.819 --> 01:06:11.268]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:12.229]  We're good to go.
[01:06:32.103 --> 01:06:33.564]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:33.744 --> 01:06:34.084]  Have you?
[01:06:34.645 --> 01:06:36.165]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:40.408]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:41.548 --> 01:06:44.370]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:45.871]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:06:46.431 --> 01:06:47.632]  Osama bin forgotten.
[01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:51.694]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:06:54.562 --> 01:07:00.584]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.205 --> 01:07:04.226]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.246 --> 01:07:13.509]  We've got some video clips of him last week on National Canadian TV telling the truth about what's happening with gold.
[01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.630]  And then right here in front of me I have another story.
[01:07:16.911 --> 01:07:19.612]  This is out of the Globe and Mail, the biggest paper in Canada.
[01:07:20.312 --> 01:07:23.293]  As gold rallies, a fringe claims victory.
[01:07:24.222 --> 01:07:27.405]  And I remember having Mr. Murphy on five years ago.
[01:07:27.425 --> 01:07:28.566]  I had him on two years ago.
[01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:32.489]  Again, a former pro football receiver, Wall Street futures trader.
[01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:43.179]  And he's got a lot of top consultants and academics rallying around his gold antitrust action committee, or GATA.
[01:07:43.199 --> 01:07:45.721]  We have links to it up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:07:47.171 --> 01:07:51.193]  And of course the article talks about his conspiracy theories, but then gets into the facts.
[01:07:51.753 --> 01:08:00.078]  It's admitted that the Federal Reserve has a plunge protection team that pumps tens of millions in a day to manipulate the stock market.
[01:08:00.098 --> 01:08:00.758]  That's not hidden.
[01:08:01.882 --> 01:08:06.545]  It's admitted they have an international team of big central banks.
[01:08:06.585 --> 01:08:08.206]  This is well known in commodities.
[01:08:08.746 --> 01:08:12.829]  I have friends and family that are involved in this that go in and suppress the price of gold.
[01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:19.953]  They'll sell it to each other at reduced prices when the companies are owned by the same people to create the illusion of a lower price.
[01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:30.116]  And they did this to try to monopolize the gold fields, to drive out the gold manufacturers, the gold producers, the gold miners, the big companies out of business.
[01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:38.483]  They did that, then bought up a lot of them, but now they can't stop the Chinese, they can't stop the DNR, they can't stop the Arabs trying to move to it.
[01:08:38.983 --> 01:08:39.603]  We're good to go.
[01:08:57.492 --> 01:09:08.004]  And so, even if you don't own gold or hold gold, we're going to play this TV clip here a little bit later, it's important that you listen to this to understand how the economy is controlled.
[01:09:08.445 --> 01:09:12.049]  And we have details of what Mr. Murphy's talking about up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:12.329 --> 01:09:13.411]  Yes, I know we have loaded phones.
[01:09:13.431 --> 01:09:16.014]  We're going to get to Eric and Emmett and Eric and many others.
[01:09:16.514 --> 01:09:23.019]  Any issue you want to talk about, it's all tied into this because it's the same crowd controlling this that controls our fiat money supply.
[01:09:23.419 --> 01:09:38.110]  And if you thought Greenspan was bad, inflating the currency by 40-plus percent in the last decade, and now it's been devalued by 45%, plunging again last week, get ready for Mr. Helicopter, who says he will totally unleash the printing presses.
[01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:43.134]  And folks, they'll cut your taxes by 8%, but then devalue your money by 45%.
[01:09:44.495 --> 01:09:46.497]  So it's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:09:47.117 --> 01:09:52.301]  And joining us is Bill Murphy, and he heads up the Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[01:09:52.682 --> 01:09:54.083]  Mr. Murphy, good to have you on with us.
[01:09:54.363 --> 01:09:55.304]  Great to be back, Alex.
[01:09:55.844 --> 01:09:56.285]  You bet.
[01:09:56.665 --> 01:09:57.946]  I tell you, I mean...
[01:09:58.849 --> 01:10:11.065]  The stock market is, even though they keep taking things out of the Dow and the NASDAQ, it's way down in the last five years, and gold has doubled in the last five years, and you just went off sound economic advice.
[01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:15.611]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and your movement, your lawsuits.
[01:10:16.395 --> 01:10:28.058]  And then please get into who we're facing, what they're up to, how the scam works, and then give us your short-term and long-term prognosis for the local economy and the global economy.
[01:10:28.938 --> 01:10:30.039]  That's a mouthful, Alex.
[01:10:30.419 --> 01:10:32.499]  I'll do a little bit at a time as best I can.
[01:10:32.539 --> 01:10:32.899]  Thank you.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:42.342]  The Gold Antitrust Action Committee was formed by myself and Chris Powell, the editor of the Journal Inquirer, a daily newspaper in Manchester, Connecticut, in January 1999.
[01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:57.995]  Because we realized the gold market was being artificially suppressed by a gold cartel which consisted of bullion banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, the Fed, the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, and so on.
[01:10:58.935 --> 01:11:03.616]  And they were keeping the price way below where it should have been if we were allowed to trade freely.
[01:11:03.776 --> 01:11:11.058]  And they did this by surreptitiously taking central bank gold, giving it to the bullion dealers who added supply to the markets.
[01:11:11.078 --> 01:11:12.838]  They would sell it into the markets.
[01:11:13.331 --> 01:11:15.952]  And that supply met the demand at the time.
[01:11:16.032 --> 01:11:18.113]  It kept the price lower than where it should have been.
[01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:25.335]  And, for example, right now it probably should be about $950 an ounce, and we're on our way there.
[01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:35.119]  Well, people will say that the central banks have 32,000 tons of gold, but because of what they've done in a nefarious way, they have less than half of that.
[01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:40.381]  They probably only have 12,000 tons left, and since the demand is 1,500 tons a year more than the supply,
[01:11:42.279 --> 01:11:44.880]  And mine supply is only 2,500 tons of going down.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:45.760]  They're running out.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:12:01.484]  Well, they're doing what the Rothschilds first learned how to do 400, 300 years ago in Germany, is that gold receipts, notes originally, folks, were just a note that a certain amount of gold was at this local goldsmith's bank.
[01:12:02.168 --> 01:12:06.071]  And that's why you get the last name Goldsmith or Goldmuns.
[01:12:06.171 --> 01:12:09.573]  It means somebody who kept gold in a safe and then gave you script.
[01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:16.638]  Well, they learned how to give out 10, 15, 20, 30 times the actual script versus real gold they had in their banks.
[01:12:16.978 --> 01:12:22.462]  They were able to buy real assets with that and get real assets as long as you didn't catch on to their scam.
[01:12:22.482 --> 01:12:32.068]  And I remember right before 9-11, it was emerging that just the gold reserves there in New York at the World Trade Center complex banks, fellow reserve systems, had been covertly shipped out.
[01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:35.309]  Well, in essence, that's what's happened.
[01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:46.835]  And what I say is what God has learned, and we predicted this four and a half years ago, that about this time they would run out because they're hitting the wall with the available gold in the central bank.
[01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:47.915]  You did predict that.
[01:12:47.955 --> 01:12:49.596]  I mean, listen, that's why we had you back.
[01:12:49.636 --> 01:12:50.636]  You did predict it.
[01:12:50.976 --> 01:12:51.737]  Well, it's happening.
[01:12:51.757 --> 01:12:58.160]  And what surprised people this year is that the gold market is moving up on its own and everyone is stunned.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.861]  You don't have, at the moment, the dollar is firmed up.
[01:13:01.152 --> 01:13:01.533]  We're good to go.
[01:13:12.623 --> 01:13:15.264]  has rallied sharply this year.
[01:13:15.384 --> 01:13:18.765]  And what's really changed, Mr. Murphy, is that it's not just you saying it now.
[01:13:18.885 --> 01:13:23.506]  All these big mainline experts are saying, look at all the other commodities dropping.
[01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:27.166]  Why is gold so bullish?
[01:13:27.807 --> 01:13:29.427]  It's really quite simple, as I mentioned earlier.
[01:13:29.487 --> 01:13:41.410]  It's because the bad guys, these bums, this gold cartel, that are rigged to price for years at the detriment of a lot of people, and that's a whole other story, they're just running out of supply to keep it, and it's unraveling.
[01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:42.090]  In other words, it's like
[01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:43.764]  I think so.
[01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:02.961]  It's huge.
[01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:06.942]  The Arabs... Hey, I'm buying when it's high.
[01:14:06.982 --> 01:14:08.603]  I'm buying when it drops.
[01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:09.163]  I'm buying.
[01:14:09.563 --> 01:14:10.763]  Well, it's gone.
[01:14:10.803 --> 01:14:14.604]  As you said earlier, it's doubled in the last four years.
[01:14:16.025 --> 01:14:23.527]  We had a conference in Dawson City where one of Putin's economic advisors came in Dawson City on August 8th and 9th in the Yukon.
[01:14:26.067 --> 01:14:29.628]  Since that conference, the gold price has gone from $4.32 and it went to $5.40.
[01:14:34.082 --> 01:14:37.023]  We know that the Russians are... Say that again.
[01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.745]  You've got governmental advisors coming to your meetings.
[01:14:41.505 --> 01:14:42.005]  That's correct.
[01:14:42.025 --> 01:14:42.886]  This is what stunned people.
[01:14:42.906 --> 01:14:45.507]  There was a mainstream gold conference in Perth, Australia.
[01:14:46.147 --> 01:14:50.669]  And we had this conference up by the Arctic Circle where the first gold rush was, Dawson City.
[01:14:51.009 --> 01:14:54.211]  We had 100 delegates from 14 countries, two Arab countries.
[01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:56.372]  We had Russians, an economic advisor.
[01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:59.673]  Your people can do a Google search on them, let you know what kind of big-time guy he is.
[01:15:00.174 --> 01:15:02.155]  Andrej Baikov, B-Y-K-O-V.
[01:15:02.175 --> 01:15:03.976]  No, I'm looking at it.
[01:15:04.036 --> 01:15:05.737]  I'm seeing news articles talking about it now.
[01:15:05.977 --> 01:15:11.279]  Well, and it was a year after a guy named Oleg Malnikov, the deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank.
[01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:12.774]  We're good to go.
[01:15:13.034 --> 01:15:13.535]  We're good to go.
[01:15:40.689 --> 01:15:41.869]  That was on August 8th at night.
[01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.070]  It goes from $4.36 to $5.40.
[01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:46.691]  The dollar went from $87 up to $91.
[01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:48.072]  Oil went from $68 to $60.
[01:15:48.732 --> 01:15:51.193]  And the only thing that happened during that time was our gold coverage.
[01:15:51.233 --> 01:15:53.554]  Now, did we have anything to do with the price rise?
[01:15:53.594 --> 01:15:57.175]  Well, we think we did, but that's up to you listeners.
[01:15:57.195 --> 01:16:02.257]  Well, regardless of what Russia is buying with both fists, so is China right now.
[01:16:02.297 --> 01:16:03.958]  Well, we know that all of them are.
[01:16:03.978 --> 01:16:04.618]  That's correct.
[01:16:04.818 --> 01:16:09.760]  And so the irony is that people in the West are still asleep.
[01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:15.950]  Well, I mean, our media told us that Enron would be great, and these idiots go and buy it.
[01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:22.012]  I mean, they tell them aspartame and mercury is nutritious for you, so then they go out and they take the shots and drink the Diet Coke.
[01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:23.373]  I mean, you just can't help these people.
[01:16:23.473 --> 01:16:27.394]  Well, you know, it's interesting as people say, well, geez, you've been talking about this for seven years.
[01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:28.555]  Why wasn't it uncovered?
[01:16:28.595 --> 01:16:31.816]  If it was such a big conspiracy or this kind of thing, it would be uncovered.
[01:16:31.836 --> 01:16:38.779]  Well, first of all, it's more like a price-fixing scheme, which the Attorney General and the Samson case recently, which are facing criminal charges...
[01:16:39.198 --> 01:16:45.820]  Well, I mean, the central bankers have always tried to suppress real commodities like gold because they want to continue to have people have faith in their fiat currencies.
[01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:49.142]  I mean, it goes back to the 1933 compensation.
[01:17:02.066 --> 01:17:07.850]  Well, you got it, and I don't think they can do it again, because I think the rest of the world would just laugh at them if they did that, but
[01:17:27.005 --> 01:17:44.596]  It is so exciting what's happening here, and for your listeners, just to do their homework, go back to our Gold Rush 21, which we just did the DVD, which has never been done before, the Gold Conference, be out in about another month, is that what's happening is the world is understanding what God knows and has been saying, and now the word is out.
[01:17:45.176 --> 01:17:51.720]  If the Russians know what we know, the other people know, and they're buying up the gold because they know the central banks are running out of us.
[01:17:52.277 --> 01:17:59.199]  Quite frankly, doesn't buying gold hurt the New World Order?
[01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:02.219]  Doesn't it hurt these big central bankers if we accelerate this?
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.280]  Well, in essence, you're exactly right.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:11.181]  Because what it does is, when the gold price goes to $3,000 an ounce, it puts money and wealth into the hands of the average person.
[01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:13.822]  Instead of what they're doing.
[01:18:13.982 --> 01:18:16.983]  It takes the power of the fiat currency away.
[01:18:17.263 --> 01:18:17.923]  Yes, it does.
[01:18:19.867 --> 01:18:20.989]  Here's the problem, though.
[01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:27.502]  If people really catch on to gold, and there really is a gold rush, we're running out of gold.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.081]  Well, that's what's going to happen.
[01:18:29.261 --> 01:18:45.315]  I mean, once people know what God knows, which is happening now, which is why the gold price is going up, the only way that that will be stopped is when the price gets high enough, the peasants of the world that bought it at $2.50 will go to their local dealer and sell it for $1,000, and that will add supply.
[01:18:45.616 --> 01:18:48.638]  So you'll get sticker shock as we go up along the way.
[01:18:48.658 --> 01:18:49.179]  All right, all right.
[01:18:49.199 --> 01:18:49.439]  Here we go.
[01:18:49.459 --> 01:18:49.759]  Stay there.

[01:22:45.222 --> 01:22:46.863]  Or simply log on to FinanceMyPC.com today.
[01:22:46.943 --> 01:22:51.186]  Welcome to the founder and the president of an organization that is just doing a lot of great work.
[01:23:04.330 --> 01:23:06.811]  Exposing these controllers.
[01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:10.552]  And every facet of our lives is controlled by the big central banks.
[01:23:10.632 --> 01:23:14.173]  Private banking families in the last hundred years in the U.S.
[01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:23.255]  and the last 300 in Europe went and paid off royalty, hook or crook, I mean this is mainstream history, to get the private issuance of the paper currencies.
[01:23:23.975 --> 01:23:26.196]  Then they used that paper currency to buy up gold.
[01:23:26.316 --> 01:23:33.418]  But then as people began to figure out that gold was better than their fiat currency, which can be devalued, they started waging war against gold.
[01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:39.699]  And the best parallel of this, I would say, would be the beers owned by the Oppenheimers.
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:54.551]  Whereas diamonds are semi-precious, and there's so many of them, they have to have a monopoly to jack up their price, gold actually is precious and is getting harder to get and harder to extract, but they have artificially driven it down.
[01:23:54.992 --> 01:23:59.996]  And they're trying to create a monopoly over gold by bankrupting the miners.
[01:24:00.516 --> 01:24:02.778]  Would you agree with that, Bill Murphy?
[01:24:03.553 --> 01:24:14.939]  Well, the irony is it's a little complicated, but in a way I'll say bankrupt, but they've made it so difficult that even at $500 gold, many of these people aren't making that much money.
[01:24:15.419 --> 01:24:18.281]  The costs over the years have just skyrocketed.
[01:24:19.561 --> 01:24:21.502]  It is harder to mine gold.
[01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:26.425]  Some of them are going bankrupt because they can't make any money at these prices.
[01:24:26.505 --> 01:24:30.907]  And what happened was because they kept the price artificially low for so long,
[01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:35.671]  Well, one of our guys, Reg House, sued the whole cartel and Boston Federal Court, and the judge said,
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.180]  We're good to go.
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:03.801]  We're good to go.
[01:25:28.747 --> 01:25:39.630]  New Orleans Federal Court, and the case was ongoing when Katrina hit, and it almost wiped the company out, so they settled the case out of court about three weeks ago.
[01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:40.451]  That's right.
[01:25:40.471 --> 01:25:45.072]  We now had a case settled concerning price-fixing.
[01:25:45.952 --> 01:25:49.113]  What was interesting, the judge allowed it to go to discovery.
[01:25:49.413 --> 01:25:54.575]  In other words, the judge in no way said it was just a frivolous suit.
[01:25:56.405 --> 01:25:58.846]  Well, that's amazing, but they didn't want it to go to discovery.
[01:25:59.286 --> 01:26:00.166]  They didn't want to get there.
[01:26:00.186 --> 01:26:04.608]  It got there, and it was settled out of court, and they can't discuss it.
[01:26:04.688 --> 01:26:11.750]  But in the case itself, Barrett Gold used an excuse that they were operating on behalf of the central banks.
[01:26:12.611 --> 01:26:18.353]  So they actually admitted what God had said in their defense and said, you can't sue us because we're operating on behalf of the government.
[01:26:19.513 --> 01:26:21.053]  Which, let's get into the government.
[01:26:21.094 --> 01:26:24.415]  We know the Federal Reserve and even other foreign governments are involved in this.
[01:26:24.455 --> 01:26:25.255]  Talk about it.
[01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:28.972]  Well, you know, this is what we've learned.
[01:26:29.152 --> 01:26:35.397]  Basically, the Germans and the English United States government have been doing what they can to suppress the prices.
[01:26:35.497 --> 01:26:36.978]  People say, well, why would they want to do that?
[01:26:37.018 --> 01:26:37.599]  They own gold.
[01:26:37.619 --> 01:26:39.100]  Why would they want to hurt their own asset?
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.383]  Well, first of all, that asset is nothing compared to their bonds and the stock markets and so on.
[01:26:45.364 --> 01:26:51.789]  We believe that the rigging of the gold price was the essence of the strong dollar policy that Rubin started in 1994, 1995, and
[01:26:53.829 --> 01:26:54.590]  I go around and speak.
[01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:58.174]  I say, would someone please tell me, you heard about the strong dollar policy.
[01:26:58.314 --> 01:27:00.777]  What did the United States do to affect this policy?
[01:27:00.797 --> 01:27:01.658]  You have a policy.
[01:27:02.098 --> 01:27:02.919]  You need to do something.
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:12.610]  So what we realized, what they did was that the rigging of the gold price was to enhance the dollar and to keep interest rates lower than they would have and so on.
[01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.856]  Now, we know that was the policy then.
[01:27:15.876 --> 01:27:37.326]  About three and a half years ago, they shifted and said, we don't care if the dollar is strong, but they've continued to try to suppress the price of gold, meanwhile letting the dollar drop from $0.30 versus the euro, now down to $0.90 versus $1.30 something with the euro.
[01:27:37.526 --> 01:27:39.027]  So we've seen a reversal of that.
[01:27:40.307 --> 01:27:43.489]  What do you think their real policy is, or are they losing control?
[01:27:43.889 --> 01:27:51.598]  Well, even in the past years, you always have Secretary Snow coming out saying that, you know, we still have a strong dollar policy.
[01:27:51.718 --> 01:27:54.802]  And as you say, the dollar's gotten weaker than it was.
[01:27:54.862 --> 01:27:59.747]  Yet in this past year, it's gone up from 81 of its low that it went to back up to 90.
[01:28:00.128 --> 01:28:03.432]  So it's actually been very firm this year after being very weak for years.
[01:28:05.746 --> 01:28:08.908]  If we have free markets, the dollar should just be what the market bears.
[01:28:09.388 --> 01:28:15.612]  All they do is give us rhetoric for Wall Street, as I talk about, and there's not much they can do about it.
[01:28:15.672 --> 01:28:17.974]  When it comes to gold, it's real simple.
[01:28:18.014 --> 01:28:24.578]  The demand is so much greater than the available supply, the price has to rise substantially to bring the market into equilibrium.
[01:28:26.562 --> 01:28:31.604]  Well, I want to talk about what they might try to do to continue to suppress it and what you see happening in the future.
[01:28:31.684 --> 01:28:37.226]  And we'll take calls on a whole bunch of different issues, but it all ties back into economics with our guest on the other side.
[01:28:37.866 --> 01:28:39.147]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:40.387]  We'll also give you their website.
[01:28:43.808 --> 01:28:44.709]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:46.790]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:50.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.934 --> 01:28:58.015]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.
[01:28:58.295 --> 01:29:06.098]  RxDrugCard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.

[01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:20.102]  Don't risk ruining your health by using cheap, counterfeit foreign drugs.
[01:29:20.202 --> 01:29:20.722]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:30:01.105]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.385 --> 01:30:12.292]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.552 --> 01:30:28.739]  yet require very little energy that's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive but it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries
[01:30:29.039 --> 01:30:29.539]  That's right.
[01:30:29.719 --> 01:30:36.821]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.121 --> 01:30:45.864]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.884 --> 01:30:46.364]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:57.791]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:30:58.412 --> 01:31:00.213]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:31:01.334 --> 01:31:09.240]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.082]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:31:12.062 --> 01:31:13.483]  's patented methodology.
[01:31:13.663 --> 01:31:20.608]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:31:20.829 --> 01:31:23.831]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:31:24.191 --> 01:31:25.512]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[01:31:25.632 --> 01:31:25.952]  That's 702-953-0267.
[01:31:25.972 --> 01:31:27.253]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[01:31:27.313 --> 01:31:28.573]  That's www.lasemedinc.com.
[01:31:28.593 --> 01:31:30.314]  Or call LASEMED at 702-953-0267 today.
[01:32:00.799 --> 01:32:08.285]  We have a former National Security Agency officer joining us to talk about the true scope of NSA spying on the American people.
[01:32:08.866 --> 01:32:11.608]  Pentagon spying on the American people has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:32:12.089 --> 01:32:22.638]  Most of it's economic spying on their competitors, stealing patent secrets, stealing other goodies, and then giving them to their companies that are allied with these crooks.
[01:32:23.912 --> 01:32:31.415]  So we'll talk about all that with an expert in the next hour and get into Bush and his unbelievably deceptive speeches.
[01:32:31.435 --> 01:32:35.096]  Ian Gonzalez has been going over and some clips of Gonzalez and Bush as well.
[01:32:35.497 --> 01:32:40.158]  I'm going to have time to talk to Eric, Emmett, Eric, Paul, and Eddie.
[01:32:41.079 --> 01:32:42.059]  That's going to be it for calls.
[01:32:42.099 --> 01:32:44.300]  Five calls I'll take in this hour, and I'm going to go to you quickly.
[01:32:45.291 --> 01:32:50.754]  And we'll try to get to those calls in the UK, because I know those are on their own dime, and I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:32:51.055 --> 01:33:00.300]  Before I go back to my guests, I'm going to get into how they engineered driving gold prices down in Tokyo from almost $5.50, is what I saw, down to about $5.15.
[01:33:01.081 --> 01:33:06.304]  But even at $5.15, it's a doubling in gold prices in the last three years.
[01:33:07.204 --> 01:33:08.285]  And how they do this.
[01:33:08.485 --> 01:33:10.286]  I mean, they've been caught doing this.
[01:33:10.326 --> 01:33:11.427]  It's very transparent.
[01:33:12.256 --> 01:33:15.959]  And we'll also get into what Mr. Murphy sees happening in the future.
[01:33:16.399 --> 01:33:24.685]  Be sure to visit Infowars.com for big fat links over to his organization's anti-gold trust organization that really lays out the facts and the information.
[01:33:24.705 --> 01:33:33.431]  Before we go back to our guest, it is very important that all of us expose this corruption that we're facing.
[01:33:33.611 --> 01:33:41.177]  And my videos, my books, the other books and videos that we carry at the Infowars.com video and bookstore...
[01:33:41.954 --> 01:33:44.762]  I mean, they answer the questions in a compelling, riveting way.
[01:33:50.533 --> 01:33:52.114]  You need to have these videos.
[01:33:52.374 --> 01:33:53.834]  And it is the 19th.
[01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:55.535]  We are up to the date.
[01:33:55.935 --> 01:34:01.017]  The orders that come in on the 19th go out on the 19th.
[01:34:01.337 --> 01:34:03.518]  The orders that come in on the 20th go out on the 20th.
[01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:07.719]  If you order in the next few days, you should get it right before Christmas.
[01:34:07.739 --> 01:34:09.160]  We ship out UPS ground.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.881]  You should get it right on Christmas or right before or maybe right after.
[01:34:13.522 --> 01:34:19.484]  You can go to InfoWars.com and go to the Secure Online Shopping Cart and order my new film, Marshall Law, the miniseries.
[01:34:20.064 --> 01:34:21.846]  We've got all these new books and videos we're carrying.
[01:34:21.866 --> 01:34:23.027]  We're radically expanding what we carry.
[01:34:38.329 --> 01:34:42.213]  Because, I mean, we're going to a full-blown video and bookstore.
[01:34:42.233 --> 01:34:47.158]  But, of course, I've got to read and look over a lot of different materials before I decide on what I want to carry.
[01:34:47.738 --> 01:34:51.322]  But we are carrying a lot of new materials, a lot of new books, books on tape.
[01:34:51.542 --> 01:34:54.024]  And we've got discounts where DVDs are as low as $5.95 apiece.
[01:34:54.064 --> 01:34:54.725]  Films are normally $25.
[01:34:54.785 --> 01:34:56.426]  T-shirts are normally $19.95 or $9.95 right now.
[01:35:01.001 --> 01:35:02.605]  And that's just until the first of the year.
[01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:04.470]  Take prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:04.791 --> 01:35:07.358]  Fifteen cents a day for a monthly membership.
[01:35:07.378 --> 01:35:07.939]  $5.95 a month.
[01:35:09.088 --> 01:35:10.629]  You get almost six months.
[01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:16.553]  It comes out to like five and three quarters months free when you get a yearly subscription.
[01:35:16.613 --> 01:35:22.617]  So basically you buy six months and you get the second half of the year free going into our second year of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:23.178 --> 01:35:29.622]  All my films, hundreds of my TV reports, all my best audio interviews, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:30.223 --> 01:35:37.668]  Or get it, I guess, for about eight cents a day if you get right now the yearly subscription for...
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:46.443]  39.95.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:46.443]  And there's just so much on PrisonPlanet.tv, and we're even going to be expanding and even improving it more.
[01:35:47.604 --> 01:35:51.766]  So be sure and become members at PrisonPlanet.tv, or give that as a gift.
[01:35:52.731 --> 01:35:53.211]  Go there.

[01:35:59.696 --> 01:36:00.456]  Put it in an email.
[01:36:00.816 --> 01:36:02.057]  Send it to your friends and family.
[01:36:02.337 --> 01:36:03.138]  Tell them to use it.
[01:36:03.378 --> 01:36:06.740]  Or download my book or Paul Watson's book on the CD.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.241]  Or print off copies.
[01:36:08.281 --> 01:36:09.022]  Give them to people.
[01:36:09.062 --> 01:36:10.423]  Or all my other films.
[01:36:10.463 --> 01:36:13.665]  It's a great activist tool to spread this information.
[01:36:13.705 --> 01:36:15.286]  Or buy the original DVDs.
[01:36:15.646 --> 01:36:16.187]  We're good to go.
[01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:36.111]  I mean, this long road, you've been proven absolutely right.
[01:36:36.171 --> 01:36:38.713]  I'm glad I took your advice when we had you on five years ago.
[01:36:38.753 --> 01:36:41.474]  I'm glad we took your advice when we had you on two years ago.
[01:36:41.534 --> 01:36:49.918]  You did predict in the middle of this decade that this had to happen, and you just have done an incredible job.
[01:36:49.958 --> 01:36:52.819]  And I love to have people back on who've panned out.
[01:36:53.299 --> 01:36:55.080]  I mean, I knew your information was accurate then.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.961]  I just didn't know if you were right about when it would happen.
[01:36:57.862 --> 01:37:00.004]  I've got a few final questions for you before we take some calls.
[01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:03.307]  How did you predict in the time frame so accurately?
[01:37:03.327 --> 01:37:14.357]  And then give us the intel on how they just drove down the price by around $35 in Tokyo before it began to spiral out of control upwards.
[01:37:15.077 --> 01:37:16.699]  Well, first, Alex, thanks.
[01:37:16.839 --> 01:37:23.185]  One of my colleagues, Frank Veneroso, who's an advisor to many governments, finance ministers, and so on,
[01:37:23.695 --> 01:37:29.377]  I came to the conference we have at the Ghana African Gold Summit in Durban, South Africa, May 10, 2001.
[01:37:30.638 --> 01:37:35.700]  He presented a paper there that the central banks would start running out of gold about this time.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.781]  Really, he did it, and I just echoed it publicly.
[01:37:38.841 --> 01:37:40.101]  That's where we are today.
[01:37:40.261 --> 01:37:43.403]  This is the beginning of the move, which is going to go on for many years.
[01:37:44.583 --> 01:37:46.444]  Recently, the price got up to $540.
[01:37:46.584 --> 01:37:47.584]  It went back down to $500.
[01:37:47.724 --> 01:37:51.066]  It actually got down to $499 in Tokyo overnight briefly.
[01:37:52.987 --> 01:38:07.777]  What happened was, and we know this for a fact, Goldman Sachs, who I've been citing as the major Hannibal Lecter, I call it, for the gold cartel for seven years, but verbally, just because of what they're doing on the floor, but in Tokyo, they report who's doing what.
[01:38:08.777 --> 01:38:10.098]  Goldman Sachs was aware of this.
[01:38:10.599 --> 01:38:20.805]  But they just, they were a new member in terms of the Tokyo exchange, showed up, shorted 70 tons of gold near the high, and just covered it as of today.
[01:38:21.146 --> 01:38:21.686]  So they took
[01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:25.163]  I didn't tell the exact time, but anywhere trading between...
[01:38:26.543 --> 01:38:33.186]  5.25 and 5.40 they sold, they fleeced the public, got them out, and they bought between 4.99 and, say, 5.08 on the downside.
[01:38:33.206 --> 01:38:35.487]  So we know this because of the TOCOM.
[01:38:35.707 --> 01:38:36.768]  So explain that to people.
[01:38:36.808 --> 01:38:43.791]  We have a Federal Reserve that will dump tens of millions a day in the stock market to jack it up or drive it down, depending on what they want to do.
[01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:52.995]  You're saying they'll go in, these gold firms working for the government, will go in the derivatives and will actually take a hit just to drive it down.
[01:38:53.355 --> 01:38:54.336]  No, just the opposite.
[01:38:54.456 --> 01:39:02.843]  They went short, meaning they sold what they didn't own at the top, and drove it down to $4.90 and made a fortune at the expense of the public.
[01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:05.545]  And if they just do it as a trade, good for them.
[01:39:05.685 --> 01:39:08.728]  But when you do it in collusion with the federal government, because we heard that...
[01:39:09.082 --> 01:39:10.403]  They also had J.P.
[01:39:10.443 --> 01:39:13.265]  Morgan sell the United States when it's collusion.
[01:39:14.086 --> 01:39:16.187]  That's against, what, the recall laws?
[01:39:16.287 --> 01:39:17.869]  It's against the antitrust laws?
[01:39:18.389 --> 01:39:21.011]  But I've also read about companies taking hits to drive it down.
[01:39:21.051 --> 01:39:22.272]  Is that accurate?
[01:39:23.573 --> 01:39:24.794]  No, not really, as far as I know.
[01:39:24.814 --> 01:39:25.615]  They're making a fortune.
[01:39:26.595 --> 01:39:30.398]  They're acting on behalf of the government, making a fortune.
[01:39:30.658 --> 01:39:32.320]  Now they cover it.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.061]  Explain to a layman how that works.
[01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:37.783]  Well, if you sell something, well, it's real simple.
[01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:42.685]  They sell it at, say, $540 or, say, $530, and they buy it at $500.
[01:39:43.526 --> 01:39:43.986]  So they made $30.
[01:39:44.146 --> 01:39:47.728]  It would be the same if they bought it at $500 and sold it at $530.
[01:39:47.988 --> 01:39:49.909]  They did that within a week's period of time.
[01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:52.130]  Now, if it's just a trade, God bless them.
[01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:59.954]  But if you're doing it with the government's blessing and you don't have any risk and you know that Morgan's selling here also and you know they're going to go after the SPACs,
[01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:03.072]  And you know the other big boys they have go with them are all selling.
[01:40:03.432 --> 01:40:04.172]  That's not fair.
[01:40:04.192 --> 01:40:05.393]  That's not American.
[01:40:05.433 --> 01:40:05.913]  It's wrong.
[01:40:06.053 --> 01:40:07.634]  We don't have free markets in the United States.
[01:40:07.654 --> 01:40:08.495]  We have rigged markets.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:24.471]  And then they'll occasionally burn some little nobody like Martha Stewart, and then, oh look, they're dealing with corruption when she did nothing, and then huge publicly sanctioned corruption just goes on like everyday business.
[01:40:24.711 --> 01:40:28.894]  That is exactly right, and this is what's happened over and over again.
[01:40:29.114 --> 01:40:35.639]  I mean, what you have is, Enron is more typical than atypical these days, and what's happened in America.
[01:40:36.252 --> 01:40:40.034]  Unfortunately, it's a tragedy and it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:41.534]  Have you seen Syriana yet?
[01:40:42.195 --> 01:40:42.475]  Pardon?
[01:40:42.595 --> 01:40:43.095]  No, I have not.
[01:40:43.515 --> 01:40:44.195]  With George Clooney.
[01:40:44.215 --> 01:40:46.396]  Of course, it's based on a true story.
[01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:49.057]  And they've just changed a few of the names.
[01:40:50.138 --> 01:40:52.199]  And I've heard the director on NPR.
[01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:53.639]  I mean, they admit it's a true story.
[01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:55.200]  I was already aware of much of the story.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:58.721]  But they just, again, changed some of the names of the countries and places.
[01:40:59.242 --> 01:41:04.504]  But in it, they're about to send an oil company exec to jail.
[01:41:05.507 --> 01:41:21.212]  And he knows he's going down for the rest of the country, and he'll just get a few years and then get out and get hundreds of millions in payoffs in his golden parachute, and they say, look, we're not looking for real transparency and really going after corrupt people, and this is the government.
[01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:25.274]  All we're looking for is the illusion of that for the people.
[01:41:25.934 --> 01:41:27.054]  That is so true.
[01:41:27.415 --> 01:41:33.677]  I cannot tell you, after seven years of working on this thing, that's what I have learned.
[01:41:33.817 --> 01:41:33.897]  It's
[01:41:35.226 --> 01:41:42.893]  The real crooks, the real bad guys skate, and they pick out a few people here and there and fight them as if they're cleaning things up.
[01:41:43.433 --> 01:41:45.175]  There's nothing being cleaned up.
[01:41:45.235 --> 01:41:46.596]  It's even rearranged with them.
[01:41:46.616 --> 01:41:50.400]  Hey, you're going to spend two years in a special federal prison known as the Hilton.
[01:41:51.316 --> 01:41:51.956]  I mean, literally.
[01:41:51.976 --> 01:41:53.217]  It's called the Hilton.
[01:41:53.797 --> 01:41:56.278]  And then you're going to get even more money when you get out.
[01:41:56.338 --> 01:41:59.839]  I mean, in fact, they do this with crooks, say, from a Reagan administration.
[01:42:00.079 --> 01:42:06.002]  We then see them in a Clinton or a Bush senior or a Bush junior administration after they get out of prison.
[01:42:06.862 --> 01:42:07.642]  Well, I don't doubt it.
[01:42:07.702 --> 01:42:09.103]  I mean, I know what we've faced.
[01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:20.032]  It's unbelievable how corrupt this is, and yet when you talk about it, people look at you cross-eyed and call you a conspiracy black helicopter lunatic.
[01:42:20.372 --> 01:42:23.893]  Oh, I mean, to say the government never did anything wrong is insane.
[01:42:24.253 --> 01:42:26.394]  Everything's fine, we should all just go back to sleep.
[01:42:26.754 --> 01:42:29.775]  Oh, Alex, the NSA doesn't listen to the American people.
[01:42:30.135 --> 01:42:35.396]  When it had been declassified in the early 90s, and then now what we hear on the nightly news, the NSA's listening to us.
[01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:37.597]  Yeah, well, it's pretty scary, isn't it?
[01:42:37.677 --> 01:42:38.477]  If it gets worse...
[01:42:39.305 --> 01:42:40.485]  Who knows what could happen.
[01:42:40.525 --> 01:42:41.786]  I'll leave that to other people.
[01:42:41.826 --> 01:42:44.446]  But I know what I'm talking about when it comes to the gold market.
[01:42:44.566 --> 01:42:49.047]  And because of the colleagues I have and the sources I've developed, we know what's going on there.
[01:42:49.147 --> 01:42:50.627]  I want to take some calls really, really fast, sir.
[01:42:50.648 --> 01:42:55.529]  But what do you see happening conservatively or then on the extreme side the next year?
[01:42:56.549 --> 01:42:59.769]  Well, within the next two years, we should see gold at $1,000.
[01:43:00.330 --> 01:43:06.491]  And I think within, oh, I don't know, even another three years or so, we're going to see an overshoot to...
[01:43:07.372 --> 01:43:07.933]  No, I understand.
[01:43:07.953 --> 01:43:08.193]  And then...
[01:43:23.010 --> 01:43:28.253]  What we have different from 1980 is that you've got, say, a 10,000, 12,000 ton short position out there.
[01:43:28.653 --> 01:43:30.994]  Of these people that have lent this gold, they can't get it back.
[01:43:31.274 --> 01:43:32.855]  That was not present in 1980.
[01:43:32.935 --> 01:43:37.657]  Well, a house that was $100,000 in 1980 on average is, what, $550,000 today?
[01:43:38.298 --> 01:43:41.019]  Well, that's a good way to describe what's coming in the gold market.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.101]  So you say it'll be overvalued at $3,000.
[01:43:44.141 --> 01:43:45.181]  What do you think?
[01:43:45.201 --> 01:43:46.922]  Well, I mean, it could be undervalued at $3,000 to $5,000.
[01:43:47.022 --> 01:43:50.864]  It's just that, I mean, that's what I... If someone asked me, where do I think the price is going...
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:58.966]  One of the attendees at Gold Rush 21 was Adam Fleming, the former chairman of Harmony Gold, now the chairman of Wits Gold.
[01:43:59.326 --> 01:44:05.811]  And he himself, this is the chairman of a major gold company, said that he expected to see gold between $3,000 and $5,000 an ounce.
[01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:06.532]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:44:06.572 --> 01:44:10.034]  People never talked like this five years ago, four years ago when you were.
[01:44:10.435 --> 01:44:11.856]  Now they are talking like it.
[01:44:12.392 --> 01:44:12.972]  Well, that's true.
[01:44:13.153 --> 01:44:19.257]  And now people, because of the price going to $540 recently, now people can actually envision it.
[01:44:19.377 --> 01:44:23.160]  A year or two ago... $500 was that psychological barrier.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:27.283]  Yeah, but a year or two ago, nobody even thought $500 was a ridiculous number.
[01:44:28.402 --> 01:44:29.122]  I mean, many people.
[01:44:29.602 --> 01:44:31.083]  No, sir, believe me, I know.
[01:44:31.123 --> 01:44:34.383]  I mean, I remember them on CNN two years ago saying, don't buy gold, it's stupid.
[01:44:34.583 --> 01:44:35.003]  That's right.
[01:44:35.864 --> 01:44:40.084]  Okay, I'll go to the stock market that's down instead of going somewhere where my money doubles.
[01:44:40.344 --> 01:44:42.725]  But again, I don't care if it goes down.
[01:44:42.765 --> 01:44:46.586]  I'm going to hold on to the meager gold I have because it's still a real commodity.
[01:44:46.646 --> 01:44:47.846]  It's not paper fiat.
[01:44:48.366 --> 01:44:49.946]  Well, it'll be worth a lot of money someday.
[01:44:50.507 --> 01:44:55.268]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in California.
[01:44:55.308 --> 01:44:56.468]  Eric, thank you for holding for 5,000 years.
[01:44:56.488 --> 01:44:56.748]  Go ahead.
[01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:59.131]  Hey, thank you so much for having me on again.
[01:44:59.151 --> 01:45:00.332]  Hey, quick thing.
[01:45:00.552 --> 01:45:04.574]  Early in the broadcast, you're talking about the Patriot Act, and you're thinking the same thing I was thinking.
[01:45:05.075 --> 01:45:12.039]  If the Patriot Act is not passed, do you believe that we will have another terrorist attack, maybe worse or lesser than 9-11?
[01:45:12.079 --> 01:45:16.422]  Yeah, because they can't carry out another terror attack and say, oh, look, we failed you.
[01:45:16.442 --> 01:45:21.025]  But if they can psychologically say, you kept us from keeping you safe, then there's another event.
[01:45:21.045 --> 01:45:22.706]  Then they'll say, don't ever question us again.
[01:45:23.306 --> 01:45:24.307]  Exactly.
[01:45:24.347 --> 01:45:26.188]  So how can I get people to realize that?
[01:45:26.208 --> 01:45:27.169]  Because the friends I talk to...
[01:45:27.543 --> 01:45:28.043]  They don't care.
[01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:29.703]  I called them the actual Hegelian principle.
[01:45:29.743 --> 01:45:31.644]  I told them a lot on their website about Marshall Law.
[01:45:31.924 --> 01:45:33.044]  They just don't want to believe it.
[01:45:33.064 --> 01:45:34.004]  Well, it's like they don't care.
[01:45:34.044 --> 01:45:38.185]  They want to stay in the stock market where they lose money instead of going to gold where they double it.
[01:45:38.205 --> 01:45:41.046]  So they're idiots and just move on to somebody else, Eric.
[01:45:41.066 --> 01:45:41.726]  Thank you.
[01:45:42.106 --> 01:45:42.846]  Thank you so much.
[01:45:42.906 --> 01:45:44.947]  Any comments to what he just said there, Mr. Murphy?
[01:45:46.247 --> 01:45:55.309]  Well, you know, like I say, you don't know what they can do these days as they start getting more, lose more control, losing control of the gold market and
[01:45:56.098 --> 01:45:59.241]  Do you think the government might carry out terror attacks?
[01:45:59.901 --> 01:46:00.161]  Pardon?
[01:46:00.622 --> 01:46:03.584]  Do you think the government's capable of carrying out terror attacks, Mr. Murphy?
[01:46:03.824 --> 01:46:04.505]  I'll get in there.
[01:46:05.265 --> 01:46:06.686]  Nothing they do would surprise me.
[01:46:07.347 --> 01:46:08.348]  Well, we've caught them red-handed.
[01:46:08.828 --> 01:46:12.311]  I stay with what I know and try to be of help to people in that area.
[01:46:12.331 --> 01:46:12.651]  I understand.
[01:46:12.691 --> 01:46:13.472]  I suggest you do.
[01:46:13.512 --> 01:46:15.413]  I'm just telling you, we got them dead to rights.
[01:46:15.754 --> 01:46:16.534]  Totally confirmed.
[01:46:17.115 --> 01:46:18.716]  Let's talk to Paul in the United Kingdom.
[01:46:18.756 --> 01:46:19.457]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:46:19.477 --> 01:46:19.777]  Go ahead.
[01:46:22.256 --> 01:46:22.536]  Hello?
[01:46:22.836 --> 01:46:23.157]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:23.197 --> 01:46:23.717]  You're on the air.
[01:46:23.837 --> 01:46:24.117]  Quickly.
[01:46:24.197 --> 01:46:24.497]  Oh, hello.
[01:46:24.918 --> 01:46:25.418]  Welcome.
[01:46:25.758 --> 01:46:30.561]  I heard you talking about the UN killing people just a couple of days ago.
[01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:34.723]  They lived in some part of the world where there was very little population.
[01:46:34.984 --> 01:46:35.744]  It was in Burma.
[01:46:36.024 --> 01:46:36.745]  It was in Burma.
[01:46:37.305 --> 01:46:38.586]  Where can I find out more about that?
[01:46:38.806 --> 01:46:41.547]  That was in the London Guardian in 1999.
[01:46:42.028 --> 01:46:45.830]  It was about them killing 4,000 as they relocated 30,000 forcibly.
[01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:46.791]  They machine-gunned them.
[01:46:48.112 --> 01:46:49.453]  Wow, that's unbelievable.
[01:46:49.473 --> 01:46:51.555]  Just calmly reported how they came in and slaughtered them.
[01:46:51.815 --> 01:47:03.625]  The other thing I was going to ask you about, you spoke ages ago, and they have admitted it, like Rumsfeld has spoken about it, when they abducted children, Dyncor.
[01:47:03.925 --> 01:47:04.185]  Yes.
[01:47:04.746 --> 01:47:07.688]  Why isn't anybody going to go and get the children and women back?
[01:47:08.369 --> 01:47:10.070]  I know, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:15.975]  I mean, Dyncor was found guilty of it with the UN in 2000, and no one ever got in trouble.
[01:47:16.679 --> 01:47:19.381]  I can play Rumsfeld admitting it in front of Congress and nothing happens.
[01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:22.223]  Yeah, but they haven't gone to get the children and women back.
[01:47:22.463 --> 01:47:22.903]  I know.
[01:47:23.564 --> 01:47:23.824]  I know.
[01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:25.925]  That's just sick.
[01:47:27.987 --> 01:47:28.707]  That's just sick.
[01:47:28.947 --> 01:47:29.388]  I totally agree.
[01:47:29.408 --> 01:47:30.949]  What do you think of this gold situation?
[01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:40.375]  Well, I really don't know much about it, but they'll use any method to destroy what is good.
[01:47:41.314 --> 01:47:42.175]  That's just obvious.
[01:47:42.295 --> 01:47:44.457]  That's just getting so more obvious every day.
[01:47:44.637 --> 01:47:53.865]  We're having things happening in the UK all the time where it's just lawlessness on their part and they're supposed to be the law.
[01:47:55.046 --> 01:47:56.348]  It's called tyranny, my brother.
[01:47:56.368 --> 01:47:58.770]  Well, I appreciate you joining us.
[01:47:59.705 --> 01:48:00.385]  I want to thank you.
[01:48:00.405 --> 01:48:02.266]  Let's take another call here.
[01:48:03.107 --> 01:48:04.347]  Let's talk to Eddie in England.
[01:48:04.407 --> 01:48:06.028]  Eddie, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:48:06.068 --> 01:48:07.909]  We're about to have to end this interview here in just a second.
[01:48:08.169 --> 01:48:08.730]  Go ahead, Eddie.
[01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:12.471]  May I make a comment on two things quickly?
[01:48:13.092 --> 01:48:16.313]  First, Gonzales, I heard your clip.
[01:48:16.373 --> 01:48:18.815]  The President has inherent authority.
[01:48:19.415 --> 01:48:21.416]  Well, I've got something.
[01:48:21.896 --> 01:48:22.657]  I love history.
[01:48:23.017 --> 01:48:24.738]  We had here in 1649 King Charles I saying...
[01:48:28.379 --> 01:48:30.721]  He had divine right of kings.
[01:48:30.741 --> 01:48:32.302]  That sounds pretty much the same.
[01:48:32.842 --> 01:48:41.527]  As far as your guest is concerned, the Jekyll Island scam substituted paper for silver.
[01:48:42.568 --> 01:48:44.269]  More or less, they are IOUs.
[01:48:44.309 --> 01:48:46.991]  They have no intrinsic value whatsoever.
[01:48:47.571 --> 01:48:51.734]  And when I take a £5 note into a bank,
[01:48:52.744 --> 01:48:54.505]  We're out of time.
[01:48:54.525 --> 01:48:55.005]  We're out of time.
[01:48:55.045 --> 01:48:55.825]  I thank you for the call.
[01:48:55.905 --> 01:48:58.626]  Sir, do you want to comment on that in the last minute we've got left, Mr. Murphy?
[01:48:58.646 --> 01:49:00.726]  I mean, comment on the fiat nature of paper?
[01:49:01.907 --> 01:49:04.227]  Well, in essence, what you people are saying is correct.
[01:49:04.247 --> 01:49:15.190]  All I can say is that people are going to want to hold gold and silver in the years to come because as we get more and more trouble in the U.S., which we don't have time to get into, they're just going to print more money.
[01:49:15.851 --> 01:49:19.393]  Well, Mr. Murphy, I don't want to wait two years before we get you back on again.
[01:49:19.453 --> 01:49:22.555]  I want to get you back on in a few months and a few months again.
[01:49:22.595 --> 01:49:23.555]  And thank you for your time.
[01:49:23.595 --> 01:49:24.836]  I know you're very, very busy.
[01:49:24.856 --> 01:49:27.957]  And I'm glad that one lawsuit has been won against these people.
[01:49:27.998 --> 01:49:32.760]  Give us the website for those that aren't online right now and can't go to Infowars.com.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:36.722]  Well, I think it would be of real help for people that can sign up for a two-week free trial.
[01:49:36.742 --> 01:49:39.984]  It's www.lemetropolecafe.com.
[01:49:40.504 --> 01:49:41.885]  L-E-M-E-T-R-O.
[01:49:42.423 --> 01:49:44.505]  P-O-L-E-C-A-S-E dot com.
[01:49:44.625 --> 01:49:47.648]  And there's a link to that over at the Gold Antitrust Group.
[01:49:48.689 --> 01:49:49.189]  Yes, there is.
[01:49:49.469 --> 01:49:50.450]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:49:50.811 --> 01:49:51.151]  Okay.
[01:49:51.431 --> 01:49:51.912]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:49:52.232 --> 01:49:52.813]  We'll see you.
[01:49:54.853 --> 01:49:57.696]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.956 --> 01:49:59.537]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.878 --> 01:50:04.542]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.902 --> 01:50:09.326]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.747 --> 01:50:13.951]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.151 --> 01:50:16.994]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.094 --> 01:50:19.576]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:50:19.776 --> 01:50:20.337]  We're good to go.
[01:50:44.295 --> 01:50:47.202]  That's InfoWars.com or AAA 2533139.
[01:50:48.044 --> 01:50:51.533]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:53.866 --> 01:50:55.847]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:50:55.927 --> 01:51:06.632]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:07.012 --> 01:51:11.534]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.594 --> 01:51:22.939]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.519 --> 01:51:30.383]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:30.763 --> 01:51:32.904]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:51:33.404 --> 01:51:38.347]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:51:38.667 --> 01:51:44.970]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:49.232]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:49.452 --> 01:51:50.212]  That's toll free.
[01:51:50.232 --> 01:51:50.272]  888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.836 --> 01:52:01.765]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:02.005 --> 01:52:04.248]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:04.449 --> 01:52:10.798]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:11.138 --> 01:52:11.779]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.437 --> 01:52:36.302]  That's herbalhealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.917 --> 01:53:00.060]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:03.081]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:03.101 --> 01:53:11.986]  Coming up, Wayne Madsen, NSA officer, former, to be exposing what's happening with the NSA.
[01:53:12.407 --> 01:53:14.268]  This is just the conditioning of the public.
[01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:15.348]  It's been going on forever.
[01:53:16.829 --> 01:53:19.491]  And we'll play clips of Bush, Gonzalez, all of it.
[01:53:19.531 --> 01:53:21.512]  Take your calls before Madsen gets on with us.
[01:53:22.436 --> 01:53:31.091]  With the Wayne Madsen Report, we're going to go to Emmett and Eric, and those have been holding the longest in that little five-minute segment that's coming up before we get Wayne on.
[01:53:31.111 --> 01:53:31.652]  So stay with us.
[01:53:31.692 --> 01:53:32.213]  I'll get to you.
[01:53:32.614 --> 01:53:35.980]  A lot of other news we haven't gotten to as well, but for the next three or four minutes here...
[01:53:37.216 --> 01:53:40.658]  I was thinking, hey, I've got the gold antitrust group coming on.
[01:53:40.978 --> 01:53:42.379]  Why not have Ted Anderson in?
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:50.865]  He's got $10 American gold pieces, Olympic coins that are collectors near the price that bullion is selling.
[01:53:50.905 --> 01:53:56.488]  So they're private, and they're not reported on, and they also have collector value on top of the gold value.
[01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:58.830]  But you're getting them at near just the gold value.
[01:53:59.705 --> 01:54:08.931]  And I personally have bought some of these, and Ted's given them to you at the price that they were about a month ago before gold went up, even lower than the price that it's gone back down to.
[01:54:08.971 --> 01:54:12.253]  So it is a great deal, and Ted, tell folks about it.
[01:54:12.613 --> 01:54:14.214]  Oh, it's just a wonderful deal, Alex.
[01:54:14.254 --> 01:54:19.958]  First of all, there's only about 750,000 of these things that were even made that are available.
[01:54:20.218 --> 01:54:22.620]  And just in your town alone, there's 800,000 people.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:24.521]  There's not enough to go around to that particular town.
[01:54:25.342 --> 01:54:27.304]  There are $369 apiece.
[01:54:27.344 --> 01:54:33.671]  They're $10 Olympic coins that were manufactured here in the United States in 1984.
[01:54:33.731 --> 01:54:39.518]  It was the first coin that the West Point Mint ever put out when they were first commissioned to be minting coins.
[01:54:40.158 --> 01:54:42.619]  And they're putting them out for a much higher price than this.
[01:54:42.639 --> 01:54:44.079]  You had to order them directly from the mint.
[01:54:44.099 --> 01:54:47.500]  So right now, actually, you get them at a discount from what they're originally selling for.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.760]  So it's really a great buy.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:54.522]  $10 Olympic coins are, once again, it's a coin that the United States issued as a collector piece.
[01:54:54.542 --> 01:55:00.143]  So they can't argue when it comes to gold confiscation that these coins are not a collectible piece.
[01:55:00.183 --> 01:55:01.063]  So it's perfect for that.
[01:55:01.123 --> 01:55:04.024]  Now, that's what I bought from you three years ago were some $10 Olympics.
[01:55:04.044 --> 01:55:04.744]  Those are good coins.
[01:55:04.884 --> 01:55:06.066]  Yeah, they're just perfect.
[01:55:06.126 --> 01:55:10.191]  As a matter of fact, people are doubling their money on these things already from about three years ago.
[01:55:10.251 --> 01:55:12.233]  So, yeah, it's a great coin to get into.
[01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:17.339]  And currently, right now, they're $369 apiece, which is also a fabulous price.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.844]  And when he's talking about $3,000 an ounce, I mean, just thinking about it...
[01:55:21.524 --> 01:55:23.846]  These coins are going to be trading for two grand apiece.
[01:55:25.368 --> 01:55:29.051]  That's a heck of an increase in the portfolio, and there's no question about it.
[01:55:29.111 --> 01:55:32.714]  I don't care if gold stays right where it's at, which the inflation shows it's going to go up.
[01:55:32.995 --> 01:55:39.561]  It's just smart to have a wad of cash at the safety deposit box that's already been devalued massively.
[01:55:40.602 --> 01:55:41.823]  The dollar's been devalued by 45%.
[01:55:41.863 --> 01:55:43.504]  Now it's gone up about 6%, so it's at about 38%.
[01:55:48.228 --> 01:55:48.709]  We're good to go.
[01:56:10.526 --> 01:56:11.147]  We're good to go.
[01:56:11.167 --> 01:56:11.327]  I think?
[01:56:25.718 --> 01:56:28.320]  Be part of all of that and get a good deal on gold.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.381]  Give Ted a call.
[01:56:29.401 --> 01:56:29.481]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:29.501 --> 01:56:29.561]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:29.601 --> 01:56:32.744]  That's an Alex Jones special to get that price on that coin.
[01:56:32.764 --> 01:56:32.824]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:56:32.844 --> 01:56:35.806]  Or go to GCNlive.com, and they've got links and phone numbers.
[01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:46.611]  There it might is, right there.
[01:56:46.631 --> 01:56:46.852]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:46.932 --> 01:56:52.193]  And there's also another great Christmas gift idea.
[01:56:52.213 --> 01:56:53.254]  You just tell them where to mail it.
[01:56:53.494 --> 01:56:54.574]  That's two U.S.
[01:56:54.694 --> 01:56:57.375]  silver dollars, or one U.S.
[01:56:57.395 --> 01:56:58.615]  silver dollar and two U.S.
[01:56:59.136 --> 01:57:03.217]  citizen rule books for $24.95, mailed wherever you want them.
[01:57:03.457 --> 01:57:07.058]  You can call us at Alex Jones Special as well, and that goes to support in the show.
[01:57:07.078 --> 01:57:07.118]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:07.138 --> 01:57:09.219]  They're there right now, aren't they, Ted?
[01:57:14.904 --> 01:57:15.524]  Is Ted still there?
[01:57:16.905 --> 01:57:17.766]  I can hear him in the background.
[01:57:17.786 --> 01:57:18.526]  I'm right here, Alex.
[01:57:18.846 --> 01:57:20.287]  Give him a call, folks.
[01:57:20.307 --> 01:57:20.607]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:20.627 --> 01:57:20.667]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:21.128 --> 01:57:27.732]  Give him a call right now, folks.
[01:57:27.752 --> 01:57:28.932]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:28.952 --> 01:57:29.312]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.475 --> 01:57:38.117]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:50.280]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.941 --> 01:57:51.981]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.701 --> 01:57:53.802]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.462 --> 01:57:55.283]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.043 --> 01:57:56.943]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.604 --> 01:58:01.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.786 --> 01:58:04.127]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:58:05.027 --> 01:58:05.928]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.108 --> 01:58:09.431]  Alright folks, now into the third and final hour.
[01:58:09.632 --> 01:58:10.592]  Masses of news.
[01:58:10.692 --> 01:58:12.354]  Wayne Manson joining us.
[01:58:12.534 --> 01:58:13.235]  Open phones.
[01:58:13.255 --> 01:58:19.801]  Getting this whole NSA slash Patriot Act propaganda pooch that we're seeing right now.
[01:58:20.001 --> 01:58:22.303]  We're getting calls saying, what's that number to minus resources?
[01:58:22.723 --> 01:58:22.944]  It's 1-800-686-
[01:58:26.792 --> 01:58:26.872]  2-2-3-7.
[01:58:26.892 --> 01:58:28.073]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:28.533 --> 01:58:34.096]  That's Midas Resources.
[01:58:34.116 --> 01:58:40.719]  This is the GCN radio network, often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:44.001]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:46.542]  Emmett in Pennsylvania, then Eric in Connecticut and others.
[01:58:46.842 --> 01:58:47.383]  Emmett, welcome.
[01:58:48.003 --> 01:58:54.006]  Yes, I called my Senator Arlen Specter, thanking him for his opposition to the Patriot Act renewal.
[01:58:54.767 --> 01:58:56.930]  And listeners should call their congressmen.
[01:58:57.591 --> 01:59:02.638]  And by the way, that Midas deal, as a collector, that Midas deal is a good deal.
[01:59:04.119 --> 01:59:06.342]  By the way, I think that maybe even buying...
[01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:09.608]  Bullion gold wouldn't be a bad idea.
[01:59:09.668 --> 01:59:11.409]  No, we pitch bullion, and I buy.
[01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:15.892]  I've got about half collectible and half bullion in my small collection.
[01:59:16.212 --> 01:59:20.875]  I believe in bullion, but when you can get collector coins for just a little bit more than bullion, it's a good deal.
[01:59:21.155 --> 01:59:23.036]  Yeah, well, let them try to find it, right?
[01:59:23.577 --> 01:59:24.457]  Well, that's the reason.
[01:59:24.477 --> 01:59:29.220]  The collectible isn't under... You see, the 1933... Well, you say you're a collector, so you know.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:34.183]  The 1933 gold confiscation rules are still in effect in that bullion is registered.
[01:59:34.674 --> 01:59:34.894]  Yes.
[01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:36.995]  You see, if you buy bullion, that gets registered.
[01:59:37.035 --> 01:59:38.256]  It's like registering a gun.
[01:59:38.676 --> 01:59:43.479]  So buying collectibles, you pay a little bit more, but they've got a loophole in there.
[01:59:43.919 --> 01:59:57.527]  Well, I've heard that the dollar was down to $1.35, $1.25 to the euro, but I also heard that England, Germany, and France have gone to the Asian countries to get the euro higher.
[01:59:58.795 --> 02:00:04.738]  Well, yeah, China moved to a basket of currencies, and now they're moving more and more out of the dollar, which is just horrible news.
[02:00:04.778 --> 02:00:05.918]  I mean, we're all tied to this thing.
[02:00:05.938 --> 02:00:10.560]  I'm not happy about it, even though it's the globalist operation.
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:13.722]  And it's all part of a larger program.
[02:00:14.282 --> 02:00:21.125]  But when you look at what they've done with the gold market, it's just an abomination.
[02:00:21.165 --> 02:00:24.407]  But it's as a caller from England said, they've done it with everything.
[02:00:25.947 --> 02:00:27.528]  Let me explain what happened to the dollar.
[02:00:28.317 --> 02:00:34.967]  Three years ago, when the Euro first came out, it was about 85 cents to the dollar.
[02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:40.335]  So when I say a 45% reduction, it's gone from being 85 cents...
[02:00:42.213 --> 02:00:43.934]  To being $1.30, $1.35.
[02:00:45.394 --> 02:00:47.855]  It's gone down about 5-6%.
[02:00:47.895 --> 02:00:53.678]  So let's say $1.29 from a low of $25, $26.
[02:00:54.498 --> 02:00:57.259]  So you do the math, it's like 45%.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.520]  That's the drop in the dollar.
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.762]  We've gone from being a strong world reserve currency to being weak.
[02:01:03.822 --> 02:01:04.442]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:05.102 --> 02:01:05.763]  Very, very serious.
[02:01:05.783 --> 02:01:09.084]  And then the dollar went up in the last month, and it went back down last week quite a bit.
[02:01:10.124 --> 02:01:11.225]  They call it big gains.
[02:01:11.265 --> 02:01:14.527]  It means like you're in the bottom of a pit and you've climbed up five feet and you fall back down.
[02:01:15.667 --> 02:01:16.288]  It's not good.
[02:01:17.068 --> 02:01:19.029]  And the things that cause that are just getting worse.
[02:01:19.749 --> 02:01:20.650]  Eric in Connecticut.
[02:01:20.670 --> 02:01:21.250]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:01:22.671 --> 02:01:23.091]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:23.371 --> 02:01:23.832]  Hello, sir.
[02:01:24.592 --> 02:01:29.655]  You know, in light of this Patriot Act on the skids, I would say be very afraid between now and New Year's.
[02:01:31.005 --> 02:01:41.377]  Well, I think they'll give it time to harp and go, you watch, they're going to get us, you took it away, it's going to be your fault, and then see, it's all our fault from the terrorist strike.
[02:01:42.038 --> 02:01:42.839]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:42.859 --> 02:01:44.621]  So that resonates with you like it does with me?
[02:01:44.841 --> 02:01:45.662]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:45.862 --> 02:01:48.805]  Because these, in the immortal words of...
[02:01:50.290 --> 02:01:55.994]  The British PM, I can't remember his name, George Galloway, said these monkeys are capable of anything.
[02:01:56.435 --> 02:01:57.395]  And I'd have to agree with that 100%.
[02:01:57.455 --> 02:01:59.997]  He said they're carrying out terror attacks, yeah.
[02:02:00.297 --> 02:02:00.798]  Yeah, that too.
[02:02:01.431 --> 02:02:07.455]  You know, Alex, I have to say, on a positive note here, I saw 60 Minutes last night.
[02:02:07.495 --> 02:02:13.279]  I'm not a big fan of 60 Minutes, but at least they did run a story about this so-called... Secret torture camps, yeah.
[02:02:13.679 --> 02:02:23.465]  I'm glad they did that, and I think that there's a lot to be very optimistic about because... I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:02:23.485 --> 02:02:24.066]  This is important.
[02:02:24.426 --> 02:02:25.607]  I didn't watch 60 Minutes.
[02:02:25.707 --> 02:02:30.110]  I just read the synopsis of the report on CBSNews.com, and yeah...
[02:02:30.675 --> 02:02:31.555]  They're lying to us.
[02:02:31.575 --> 02:02:34.357]  They take innocent people to foreign countries and gulags and torture them.
[02:02:34.637 --> 02:02:36.158]  The government's a bunch of big fat liars.
[02:02:36.578 --> 02:02:38.959]  And Germany and others acted like they were all upset.
[02:02:39.019 --> 02:02:40.180]  They're involved in it.
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:43.841]  They're owned by the same people that own us.
[02:02:45.442 --> 02:02:49.764]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.964 --> 02:02:54.306]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:06.283]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.363 --> 02:03:13.285]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.405 --> 02:03:15.426]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.826 --> 02:03:26.189]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.409 --> 02:03:31.770]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:35.051 --> 02:03:35.792]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:36.292 --> 02:03:37.352]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:45.484 --> 02:03:46.164]  Hello, folks.
[02:03:46.244 --> 02:03:53.826]  Alex Jones here, introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.
[02:03:53.986 --> 02:04:04.049]  Find out about everything from job migration to evacuation information, such as major bridges in disrepair and FEMA evacuation time studies for coastal cities.
[02:04:04.529 --> 02:04:10.394]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.
[02:04:10.614 --> 02:04:15.037]  Find out everything from where to get water in an emergency to geographic income levels.
[02:04:15.278 --> 02:04:21.322]  Housing prices, complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S.
[02:04:21.503 --> 02:04:27.988]  Full-color photographs, 550 high-resolution full-color maps, and detailed information and analysis that you need.

[02:04:35.435 --> 02:04:35.695]  That's 888-803-4438
[02:04:45.575 --> 02:04:51.937]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:52.157 --> 02:04:57.159]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:57.479 --> 02:05:05.382]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.542 --> 02:05:12.585]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.845 --> 02:05:13.646]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:42.885 --> 02:05:47.711]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:47.731 --> 02:05:51.034]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:09.473]  He's written for the Village Voice, the progressive CAQ counterpunch, the intelligence newsletter based in Paris.
[02:06:09.513 --> 02:06:21.442]  Madison is an author of Genocide and Covert Operations in Africa, a co-author of America's Nightmare, the presidency of George Bush II, and the forthcoming Jaded Task, Big Oil, Black Ops, Brass Place.
[02:06:21.462 --> 02:06:24.985]  I'm going to get that book in our bookstore when he comes out with it.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.000]  And so much more.
[02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:30.941]  The Handbook of Personal Data Protection, London MacMillan, 92, that was a bestseller.
[02:06:31.482 --> 02:06:32.982]  Madison is a former U.S.
[02:06:33.002 --> 02:06:36.183]  Naval officer who was assigned to the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration.
[02:06:36.543 --> 02:06:39.564]  He also had some 20 years' experience in computer security and data privacy.
[02:06:39.584 --> 02:06:48.406]  He's also worked at the National Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Science Corporation that bought DynCorp, by the way, and doesn't like me too much.
[02:06:49.947 --> 02:06:52.527]  Got the direct word they're angry with me here locally.
[02:06:52.547 --> 02:06:54.248]  Just say hi to those boys.
[02:06:55.183 --> 02:07:00.726]  And before I go any further, going to Wayne Madsen, I appreciate joining us today on short notice.
[02:07:00.866 --> 02:07:06.709]  I want to quickly go back to that one caller that I was just talking to before the break.
[02:07:07.704 --> 02:07:10.286]  Who was making some really good points.
[02:07:10.406 --> 02:07:13.428]  Eric in Connecticut about good things happening, good news.
[02:07:14.328 --> 02:07:16.189]  I don't want to gloss over that good news.
[02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:19.311]  Quickly tell us that good news because you got cut short.
[02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:23.253]  Well, thanks for holding me over, Alex, and I'm also looking forward to hearing Wayne's interview with you.
[02:07:23.513 --> 02:07:24.054]  Absolutely.
[02:07:25.174 --> 02:07:28.136]  The reason I say I'm optimistic is because here's a guy, Bush.
[02:07:29.184 --> 02:07:36.386]  I mean, it's a blue moon when he does a press release or a press conference and giving addresses to the nation.
[02:07:36.426 --> 02:07:37.766]  And we got three in a row.
[02:07:37.946 --> 02:07:40.067]  He hates these like the devil hates holy water.
[02:07:40.367 --> 02:07:41.887]  And he's got to do more spinning.
[02:07:41.967 --> 02:07:45.348]  He's done more spinning in the past week than he's done in about three years.
[02:07:45.888 --> 02:07:51.929]  So I think the message is getting out, and I think a lot of these politicians are getting a lot of questions and a lot of very furrowed brows from people.
[02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:54.470]  And one last thing, Alex, before I go.
[02:07:55.051 --> 02:08:01.273]  My new selectman, the old one who wanted to combine the police and the National Guard, got defeated for the last election.
[02:08:01.293 --> 02:08:08.256]  And I told her about your website, and she wants some DVDs, and I'm going to make them to her, and I'm going to give them to her before the end of the year.
[02:08:09.326 --> 02:08:09.606]  Good.
[02:08:09.666 --> 02:08:10.927]  You keep it up, and God bless you.
[02:08:11.007 --> 02:08:11.427]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:11.607 --> 02:08:13.408]  It's people like that that are saving this country.
[02:08:13.508 --> 02:08:14.548]  It isn't about left or right.
[02:08:14.568 --> 02:08:15.869]  Bill Clinton spied on you.
[02:08:17.269 --> 02:08:18.610]  Back in Kennedy's day, they did.
[02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:20.851]  But now it's mechanized.
[02:08:21.651 --> 02:08:22.431]  And I hope you're right.
[02:08:22.451 --> 02:08:26.333]  I hope Bush is giving three mindless speeches because he is in trouble.
[02:08:26.353 --> 02:08:27.033]  But I'm telling you...
[02:08:27.916 --> 02:08:31.898]  The globalists can't carry out another attack because people will say, oh, you screwed up.
[02:08:32.178 --> 02:08:38.981]  But if they can act like we defeated the Patriot Act and then harp on how we tied their hands, they can get a lot of gas mileage out of it.
[02:08:39.582 --> 02:08:41.423]  We've already stopped them carrying out other attacks.
[02:08:41.483 --> 02:08:44.144]  Believe me, folks, by being bold, by being out in the open.
[02:08:44.424 --> 02:08:49.466]  We'll find out if Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com agrees with us on that.
[02:08:49.947 --> 02:08:50.547]  But I know this.
[02:08:50.587 --> 02:08:51.888]  James Banford reported on it.
[02:08:52.168 --> 02:08:53.108]  He was there at the time.
[02:08:54.129 --> 02:08:54.749]  Our guest was.
[02:08:55.249 --> 02:09:06.553]  The NSA has been spying on us since it was set up, and most of it is economics spying on companies and giving it to select military industrial complex companies.
[02:09:06.593 --> 02:09:11.555]  It's also about mapping trends and trying to basically beat people to the punch on that.
[02:09:11.595 --> 02:09:12.835]  It's about insider trading.
[02:09:13.275 --> 02:09:14.916]  It's about controlling this big scam.
[02:09:15.136 --> 02:09:16.817]  Wayne Madsen, thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:09:17.097 --> 02:09:17.837]  Good to be with you.
[02:09:18.457 --> 02:09:21.839]  Do you agree with my ramblings that I was just spewing?
[02:09:22.739 --> 02:09:29.263]  Well, one thing, we know that NSA was basically not regulated.
[02:09:29.563 --> 02:09:39.968]  And we know that from the Vietnam War days and the Watergate era that NSA was doing a lot of this political spying internally.
[02:09:40.569 --> 02:09:42.370]  And then, of course, we had hearings.
[02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:44.850]  We had Frank Church in the Senate.
[02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:48.612]  We had Otis Pike and Bella Abzug over on the household hearings.
[02:09:48.652 --> 02:09:49.952]  This isn't our first rodeo.
[02:09:50.212 --> 02:09:50.692]  No, no.
[02:09:51.112 --> 02:10:02.316]  And what we got out of this was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which limited what NSA could do and set up this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that said that NSA could only eavesdrop on U.S.
[02:10:02.396 --> 02:10:02.856]  persons.
[02:10:02.896 --> 02:10:04.597]  And that's the U.S.
[02:10:04.657 --> 02:10:08.458]  companies, individuals, green card holders living in the United States.
[02:10:09.265 --> 02:10:14.227]  They could only do that if there was a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
[02:10:14.487 --> 02:10:22.871]  What Bush has done with this administration by Fiat is he's just ignored the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
[02:10:22.891 --> 02:10:23.932]  He said, I don't need the court.
[02:10:24.212 --> 02:10:25.072]  I don't need the law.
[02:10:25.452 --> 02:10:28.694]  And he says he wants it, just fills out their own national security letter.
[02:10:29.014 --> 02:10:29.654]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:29.834 --> 02:10:33.936]  In my opinion, also, I think the reason this was leaked by senior people at the NSA is
[02:10:34.477 --> 02:10:38.270]  Is that they know it was illegal, and they don't want to go back to those bad old days.
[02:10:39.457 --> 02:10:41.038]  And they know he violated the law.
[02:10:41.098 --> 02:10:42.338]  Well, Wayne, you're an expert on this.
[02:10:42.418 --> 02:10:43.618]  I mean, I'm not just saying this.
[02:10:43.758 --> 02:10:47.700]  I read your reporting, and it's heads above so many other people that just don't know.
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:49.420]  I mean, I read them like, yeah, this guy's right on.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.021]  Just from my experience dealing with these people.
[02:10:52.421 --> 02:10:58.003]  I mean, 10 years ago, I'd be at a Second Amendment rally and have guys on a roof in camo taking photos of me.
[02:10:58.043 --> 02:11:04.605]  So all this stuff about the military takes photos of us and is watching us, that's never stopped since Vietnam.
[02:11:04.965 --> 02:11:06.485]  Quite frankly, I think it's increased.
[02:11:06.505 --> 02:11:08.586]  What I know about NSA, people that have been in it,
[02:11:08.786 --> 02:11:23.593]  By the way, folks, who can't even come on air, is that when they want to go public with something they've gotten, something they've sucked up, then they have to go through and create basically a new investigation and try to stick it in that envelope.
[02:11:23.873 --> 02:11:33.037]  And I'm not saying there aren't good people there at NSA, Wayne, but certainly there are compartments that you were never even connected to, and we know that there are zealots who are out there
[02:11:33.297 --> 02:11:34.097]  Well, that's right.
[02:11:34.117 --> 02:11:38.759]  I think the problem at NSA is that the senior management levels, the people who do the work, the analysts, the linguists, the mathematicians,
[02:12:01.488 --> 02:12:02.409]  They know what the law is.
[02:12:02.429 --> 02:12:03.449]  They're briefed on that.
[02:12:04.130 --> 02:12:13.177]  They have an internal Bible called UCEDD 18, United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18, that says they are not allowed to conduct surveillance of U.S.
[02:12:13.237 --> 02:12:22.523]  persons unless certain requirements are met, one of which is, of course, that there's been a court order, there's been authorization through the liaison with the Justice Department.
[02:12:22.583 --> 02:12:25.666]  Now Bush is saying he wants to prosecute whoever's leaking.
[02:12:27.467 --> 02:12:28.868]  It's like he wanted to prosecute...
[02:12:29.232 --> 02:12:30.574]  Well, I totally agree with you on that.
[02:12:44.888 --> 02:12:49.293]  I mean, Bush is up there saying the Patriot Act is good and never been used against U.S.
[02:12:49.333 --> 02:12:49.833]  citizens.
[02:12:50.233 --> 02:12:56.619]  I have them using the Patriot Act to go to a college senior who his professor said, go check out Mal's red book and write a report on it.
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:01.064]  I mean, the political science class is about command and control economies.
[02:13:01.344 --> 02:13:04.167]  And so Homeland Security comes out and toy store owners.
[02:13:04.227 --> 02:13:05.388]  I mean, we know the list.
[02:13:06.088 --> 02:13:10.550]  Watching Bush's speeches, what is it like for you to watch 100% pure lies?
[02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:16.172]  I can't take it.
[02:13:16.552 --> 02:13:21.493]  After living in Washington for as long as I have, I used to listen to speeches by Ronald Reagan.
[02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:29.016]  Although they didn't contain much substance, at least you could sit there and listen to them.
[02:13:29.556 --> 02:13:31.877]  But this guy is so vacuous.
[02:13:33.526 --> 02:13:34.707]  There's just nothing there.
[02:13:34.767 --> 02:13:36.108]  There's no there there with him.
[02:13:36.449 --> 02:13:43.676]  And everything that he was saying last night was obviously pre-canned, written by all these political advisors.
[02:13:44.097 --> 02:13:50.283]  And his speech, his news conference today was couched in all this imperial presidency stuff.
[02:13:50.563 --> 02:13:53.026]  He's relying on Article II of the Constitution.
[02:13:53.467 --> 02:14:02.595]  But the framers of that Constitution wrote that because they never wanted another King George, and we got another King George apparently through the back door.
[02:14:03.096 --> 02:14:07.860]  Well, later I'm going to play a clip, and I want to back that up, John, to the point you had it at, where...
[02:14:08.704 --> 02:14:14.026]  Where Gonzalez, the Attorney General, the same guy that says Bush is the law, says it again.
[02:14:14.066 --> 02:14:16.147]  He says he has this executive power.
[02:14:16.547 --> 02:14:21.169]  And Bush in his press conference bragged, hey, I can ban you asking questions from executive order.
[02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:22.210]  Executive order.
[02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:25.371]  He signs an executive order saying we all got to paint ourselves green, Wayne.
[02:14:25.391 --> 02:14:26.011]  We don't have to do it.
[02:14:26.512 --> 02:14:27.372]  Well, that's right.
[02:14:27.632 --> 02:14:33.395]  And the thing with Bush, but the reason Bush got away with this, and he keeps saying, well, the Congress gave me the authorization.
[02:14:33.415 --> 02:14:34.155]  The Congress did this.
[02:14:34.642 --> 02:14:47.467]  That is a Republican Congress that gave him that authorization, and people need to understand that next November, that this Congress has become a rubber stamp, a rump organization for this administration.
[02:14:48.487 --> 02:14:53.369]  An independent Congress would have never given him that kind of authorization, but he can use those.
[02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:58.251]  He can use the Congress like the Soviet Politburo used to use these rubber stamp bodies.
[02:14:58.271 --> 02:14:58.951]  They had to change...
[02:14:59.831 --> 02:15:03.654]  I mean, this was just all kinds of nonsense.
[02:15:03.674 --> 02:15:04.975]  Let's get something else straight here.
[02:15:05.015 --> 02:15:14.542]  With Able, Danger, with Clinton and Bush, with all of it, any time NSA or Defense Intelligence had the smoking gun, they would come back to them and say, back off.
[02:15:14.923 --> 02:15:18.445]  When the Defense Language School deans going, why am I training these Arabs?
[02:15:18.785 --> 02:15:19.726]  Muhammad Atta, by the way.
[02:15:20.647 --> 02:15:24.310]  When they're at Pensacola Naval Air Station, people go, these are terrorists, leave them alone.
[02:15:24.650 --> 02:15:26.071]  Clearly they were government agents.
[02:15:26.411 --> 02:15:34.576]  But every time NSA did do its job overseas, or every time an embassy didn't want to let the hijackers back in, they were told, back off, give us your take on that.
[02:15:34.596 --> 02:15:37.537]  So, I mean, clearly our government is protecting the terrorists.
[02:15:38.158 --> 02:15:41.660]  Not only protected them, but they basically groomed them.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:51.285]  I go back to 1986, and I've got something on my website today showing a memo from a conservative, something called the Conservative Network Association,
[02:15:51.650 --> 02:16:05.415]  About hosting parties here in Washington for international freedom fighters that included not only the Nicaraguan Contras and the Southeast Asian guerrillas, but the Afghan Mujahideen.
[02:16:05.435 --> 02:16:14.038]  And they were, at the time, tied in and linked up with the Saudis who were funding Osama bin Laden and all his Confederates.
[02:16:14.457 --> 02:16:17.020]  And that Mujahideen, one of their veterans, is now the U.S.
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:21.686]  ambassador to Iraq, coincidentally, Zalmay Khalilzad.
[02:16:22.006 --> 02:16:32.298]  So, yeah, not only... I mean, you can trace this support for these people back to the 1980s, and the guy that was supporting that network was a guy named Jack Abramoff.
[02:16:33.897 --> 02:16:36.100]  And his confederate, Grover Norquist.
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:38.022]  Look at all the trouble they're in right now.
[02:16:38.102 --> 02:16:40.304]  So understand, folks, what Bush says.
[02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:43.948]  I'm doing this to keep you safe while our borders are wide open.
[02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:45.811]  Understand, it's pure baloney.
[02:16:45.851 --> 02:16:49.374]  These supposed hijackers were given top spy training.
[02:16:49.575 --> 02:16:51.637]  They were government operatives, Wayne.
[02:16:52.318 --> 02:16:54.200]  Well, look, everybody knows...
[02:16:54.676 --> 02:16:58.158]  That there was all kinds of hanky-panky going on before 9-11.
[02:16:58.779 --> 02:17:00.100]  Abel Danger shows that.
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:10.606]  There's the Israeli art students who were really Israeli intelligence agents that were living in the same neighborhoods, drinking in the same bars, renting videos from the same video rental stores.
[02:17:10.626 --> 02:17:13.048]  Handling the FBI operatives in the houses!
[02:17:13.599 --> 02:17:14.080]  That's right.
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:20.006]  And that the people like John O'Neill who were trying to track this down were stymied at every turn.
[02:17:20.086 --> 02:17:29.217]  I've also been informed of other FBI agents who were trying to go after these so-called Israeli art students and these so-called movers and they were stopped at
[02:17:29.737 --> 02:17:33.223]  The orders came from John Ashcroft and Mueller himself.
[02:17:33.243 --> 02:17:35.066]  WayneMadsdenReport.com.
[02:17:35.126 --> 02:17:36.608]  Unbelievable information.
[02:17:37.069 --> 02:17:38.511]  Just absolutely on target.
[02:17:39.012 --> 02:17:39.593]  Stay with us, Wayne.
[02:17:39.613 --> 02:17:44.120]  I want to come back and get more into all this spying with your NSA background, and then I want to get into some other issues.
[02:17:45.481 --> 02:17:54.147]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[02:17:54.487 --> 02:17:59.230]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:03.513]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[02:18:03.854 --> 02:18:08.897]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[02:18:09.317 --> 02:18:13.100]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like joint care,
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:14.000]  To learn more, that's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:18:41.852 --> 02:18:41.872]  38-41.
[02:18:45.606 --> 02:18:48.869]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:48.949 --> 02:18:53.113]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:53.373 --> 02:18:56.155]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:56.355 --> 02:18:58.757]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:58.938 --> 02:19:07.585]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:07.785 --> 02:19:09.126]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:19:09.326 --> 02:19:13.490]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:14.190]  We're good.
[02:19:32.739 --> 02:19:35.561]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:35.581 --> 02:19:36.461]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:46.200]  We're good to go.
[02:20:12.366 --> 02:20:17.527]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:20:47.188 --> 02:20:50.652]  Government is best, which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:51.093 --> 02:20:53.756]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:54.238 --> 02:20:56.880]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:03.804]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:21:15.893 --> 02:21:17.934]  It's time to stand up for what you believe.

[02:21:24.638 --> 02:21:26.060]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:26.600]  Have you?
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:28.682]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:21:29.142 --> 02:21:32.865]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:21:32.885 --> 02:21:36.888]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:21:37.369 --> 02:21:38.410]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:21:38.970 --> 02:21:40.151]  Osama bin forgotten.
[02:21:40.591 --> 02:21:44.274]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:21:44.294 --> 02:21:49.038]  All right, here is Gonzalez.
[02:21:49.098 --> 02:21:50.079]  And this goes on.
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:51.921]  I'll play more of it later.
[02:21:52.998 --> 02:22:00.405]  But here's Gonzalez on national television, on NBC, and he's just... Now listen to what he says.
[02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:02.546]  The president has this executive power.
[02:22:03.127 --> 02:22:06.450]  No, the president doesn't have the power to violate the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[02:22:07.331 --> 02:22:13.316]  This is the same guy, the same Attorney General who said, Bush, we're allowed to torture people until they die if we just don't call it torture.
[02:22:13.928 --> 02:22:26.852]  That's like saying you can drink 14 vodkas and go down the road drunk and run over a little kid, you know, jump the curb and run over some kid on his bike, and when the kid's all splattered and dead and the cops get there and go, well, I don't call this vodka, I call it water!
[02:22:27.492 --> 02:22:29.092]  So let's go ahead and play this buffoon.
[02:22:29.132 --> 02:22:29.513]  Here it is.
[02:22:30.153 --> 02:22:37.795]  Does the president have to avoid the normal process of obtaining court-approved search warrants before eavesdropping is conducted?
[02:22:38.669 --> 02:22:54.367]  Katie, we believe the President has inherent authority as Commander-in-Chief under the Constitution to engage in signal intelligence of our enemy, but we also believe that the President has the authority under the Authorization of the Used Military Force, which was passed by the Congress
[02:22:55.267 --> 02:22:57.348]  Just days after the attacks of 9-11.
[02:22:57.708 --> 02:23:07.990]  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does require a court order to engage in the kind of electronic surveillance the President talked about on Saturday, except as otherwise authorized by statute.
[02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:18.253]  We believe that authorization to use military force constitutes that statute which does give permission for the President of the United States to engage in this kind of very limited, targeted,
[02:23:18.653 --> 02:23:20.515]  Electronic surveillance against our enemies.
[02:23:20.575 --> 02:23:25.298]  Well, apparently some members of Congress disagree with you because there's been an outcry.
[02:23:25.598 --> 02:23:26.859]  That's enough right there.
[02:23:26.879 --> 02:23:27.700]  We'll play the rest later.
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:30.642]  But here's the point, folks.
[02:23:33.504 --> 02:23:35.666]  He can say it's constitutional all day.
[02:23:35.706 --> 02:23:39.068]  That doesn't make it constitutional.
[02:23:39.729 --> 02:23:42.111]  And I want to get a comment from Wayne Madsen on that.
[02:23:42.171 --> 02:23:42.371]  Wayne?
[02:23:43.147 --> 02:24:04.900]  Well, I mean, when he says this surveillance was limited, you know, actually, Gonzalez doesn't know what he's talking about because the nature of modern telecommunications is that when you attempt to target one individual, you're picking up an awful lot of other communications as well.
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:08.302]  And this is fishnet intelligence gathering.
[02:24:09.283 --> 02:24:11.224]  And furthermore... They admit what it does.
[02:24:11.264 --> 02:24:16.186]  They just let the NSA... They sign a letter and then the NSA can go out and spy on thousands of phones.
[02:24:16.286 --> 02:24:17.226]  It's even worse than that.
[02:24:17.266 --> 02:24:22.728]  People in NSA have told me that they call some operations training exercises because they don't have to keep logbooks.
[02:24:22.748 --> 02:24:29.350]  They don't have to have any... They're supposed to get rid of all that information afterwards, but they're not doing it.
[02:24:29.431 --> 02:24:30.651]  And this is a way to get around...
[02:24:31.395 --> 02:24:37.238]  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, used at 18, and all the other controls that were put in place.
[02:24:37.278 --> 02:24:38.978]  They just called a training exercise.
[02:24:39.618 --> 02:24:49.703]  The intelligence, the intercepts go to, like, Cheney's office or Bush or the GOP operatives, and there's no record that NSA held on those operations.
[02:24:49.723 --> 02:24:55.585]  Well, you've got a report here, and it says NSA intercepts for Bolton were masked as training exercises.
[02:24:55.605 --> 02:24:56.005]  That's right.
[02:24:56.225 --> 02:24:57.646]  This guy wouldn't lie about the...
[02:24:59.171 --> 02:25:00.512]  Yellow cake uranium.
[02:25:00.532 --> 02:25:03.315]  Well, it turns out they're out snooping around with the NSA there.
[02:25:03.916 --> 02:25:05.217]  I guess he's with Al Qaeda, too?
[02:25:05.737 --> 02:25:07.439]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:07.459 --> 02:25:19.631]  Well, they were also eavesdropping on... Bolton was using the NSA to eavesdrop on his own boss, Colin Powell, who had conversations with Governor Bill Richardson in New Mexico.
[02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:24.055]  So if they're saying that Richardson and Powell are members of Al Qaeda, that's just...
[02:25:24.475 --> 02:25:25.736]  That's interesting to me.
[02:25:26.156 --> 02:25:30.779]  I just wonder when Richardson and Powell are going to be picked up and sent to Guantanamo to be tortured.
[02:25:33.961 --> 02:25:34.761]  It's incredible.
[02:25:34.781 --> 02:25:38.663]  I mean, look, Wayne, 10 years ago, and I've got video of this.
[02:25:38.683 --> 02:25:39.584]  I've made films about it.
[02:25:40.427 --> 02:25:45.753]  I'm out at a pretty milquetoast event, mainstream groups there, and there's guys in camo on top roofs.
[02:25:45.793 --> 02:25:47.935]  Well, now, I'll be at the RNC.
[02:25:47.955 --> 02:25:50.678]  They'll just march right up in camo and start video.
[02:25:50.898 --> 02:25:51.819]  Regular Army.
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:55.243]  And we hear about them going to peace groups, conservative groups.
[02:25:55.843 --> 02:26:03.288]  You know, the Army surveilling local student groups that don't want them recruiting in their public schools so the Army starts watching them.
[02:26:03.308 --> 02:26:05.649]  I mean, this was all going on before 9-11.
[02:26:05.689 --> 02:26:06.550]  Now it's gotten worse.
[02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:08.711]  But then Bush gets on TV and says, everything's fine.
[02:26:09.011 --> 02:26:10.092]  We're not surveilling you.
[02:26:10.132 --> 02:26:11.413]  The Pentagon isn't watching you.
[02:26:11.473 --> 02:26:14.735]  And I've had physical assets, buddy, following me around.
[02:26:15.235 --> 02:26:17.178]  Well, yes, and I've seen it too.
[02:26:17.418 --> 02:26:29.231]  I started seeing it at these anti-World Bank demonstrations where clearly people in uniform were taking photographs of the people who had legal permits to demonstrate against the World Bank meetings.
[02:26:30.049 --> 02:26:33.390]  So this is nothing new, but you're right, it's getting much worse.
[02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:47.934]  I think we're turning into sort of like East Germany was with the Stasi when we know from the East German files that 25% of the population of East Germany were informants and spying on their neighbors and even members of their own family.
[02:26:49.699 --> 02:26:56.000]  Wayne, I didn't believe it five years ago, three years ago, two years ago, when I hear about Primakov being hired as a consultant or this guy or that guy.
[02:26:56.020 --> 02:27:00.481]  But then I did confirm our government has hired these guys as consultants.
[02:27:00.521 --> 02:27:02.161]  Then they said, oh, but it's for overseas.
[02:27:02.421 --> 02:27:04.342]  But then I learned they've been hired domestically.
[02:27:04.362 --> 02:27:07.482]  I mean, this is like a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:27:07.502 --> 02:27:08.763]  A very bad Twilight Zone.
[02:27:11.503 --> 02:27:14.164]  But then the NSA is tracking a real terrorist.
[02:27:14.264 --> 02:27:15.104]  What does Bush say?
[02:27:15.144 --> 02:27:15.544]  Back off.
[02:27:16.044 --> 02:27:16.464]  That's right.
[02:27:17.353 --> 02:27:17.833]  Wayne, stay there.
[02:27:17.853 --> 02:27:22.294]  I want to play another clip and get your take on it and get your take on where you think everything's going.
[02:27:22.895 --> 02:27:25.595]  On the other side with Wayne Madsen, waynemadsenreport.com.
[02:27:25.895 --> 02:27:26.556]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:27:26.596 --> 02:27:33.217]  Be sure and visit prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com today as we defend the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:27:35.578 --> 02:27:36.478]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.958 --> 02:27:38.579]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.479 --> 02:27:42.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.851 --> 02:27:48.213]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.453 --> 02:27:52.296]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:27:52.616 --> 02:27:53.437]  Read the labels.
[02:27:53.877 --> 02:27:58.000]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:02.403]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.783 --> 02:28:07.647]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:08.027 --> 02:28:11.609]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:11.809 --> 02:28:17.152]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.412 --> 02:28:20.154]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.434 --> 02:28:21.334]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:21.634 --> 02:28:32.380]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:28:45.632 --> 02:28:49.515]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.755 --> 02:28:55.180]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:05.828]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:06.008 --> 02:29:10.352]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.532 --> 02:29:18.900]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:25.486]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:29:25.626 --> 02:29:25.866]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:47.157 --> 02:29:49.898]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[02:29:50.138 --> 02:29:55.179]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[02:29:55.239 --> 02:29:56.660]  But now, we don't have to.
[02:29:56.680 --> 02:30:05.042]  The Sacral Wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[02:30:05.462 --> 02:30:09.405]  Simply line your back with the Sacral Wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[02:30:09.665 --> 02:30:12.667]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[02:30:13.108 --> 02:30:16.550]  Use the Sacral Wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[02:30:16.851 --> 02:30:20.253]  Get your Sacral Wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:30:20.473 --> 02:30:20.673]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:20.693 --> 02:30:22.775]  That's 877-817-9829 and ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:31.881]  Yeah, getting older is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[02:30:32.141 --> 02:30:33.381]  Get your soccer wedgie today.
[02:30:33.642 --> 02:30:35.822]  Specify if it's for a man or a woman and call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:35.842 --> 02:30:37.063]  That's 877-817-9829 and give yourself a wedgie.
[02:30:54.379 --> 02:31:03.082]  All right, I was talking to Wayne Mastin during the break, and we'll tell you about the points that he raised when we go back to him here in just one minute.
[02:31:03.882 --> 02:31:05.623]  And we'll also play a clip of Bush.
[02:31:05.903 --> 02:31:10.184]  It's unbelievably disgusting, and a little bit more of that clip with Alberto.
[02:31:10.865 --> 02:31:11.925]  Bush is above the law.
[02:31:12.165 --> 02:31:12.965]  I love torture.
[02:31:14.226 --> 02:31:17.607]  Gonzalez, and I'm a member of a Mexican supremacist organization.
[02:31:18.493 --> 02:31:22.116]  I mean, it's just, again, it is a twilight zone life.
[02:31:22.196 --> 02:31:30.804]  But if you want to see the troops training to take your guns, the troops training to confiscate your firearms and break your families up, and these programs haven't gone away under Bush, they've expanded.
[02:31:31.024 --> 02:31:32.505]  I mean, I wouldn't cover this under Bill Clinton.
[02:31:32.746 --> 02:31:33.406]  He's just a puppet.
[02:31:34.047 --> 02:31:34.787]  Same thing with Bush.
[02:31:36.269 --> 02:31:40.412]  Then you need to get Police State 2000, Police State Through the Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:31:40.593 --> 02:31:45.076]  You need to get my new film, Martial Law, to see cops and military taking video of us at the RNC.
[02:31:46.491 --> 02:31:49.492]  And then I got video of it from Alabama to Texas.
[02:31:49.512 --> 02:31:50.073]  Just troops.
[02:31:50.153 --> 02:31:51.734]  I mean, that's five minutes of a film.
[02:31:52.254 --> 02:31:53.634]  Of a three-hour miniseries.
[02:31:53.674 --> 02:31:55.815]  Martial Law is three one-hour films in one.
[02:31:56.076 --> 02:31:59.137]  It's Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[02:32:00.137 --> 02:32:03.399]  There's my new film, The Order of Death, about what these weirdos do in their off hours.
[02:32:03.419 --> 02:32:07.261]  These Christian conservative leaders run around involved in bizarre cult activities.
[02:32:09.202 --> 02:32:11.683]  Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut couldn't hold a candle to this.
[02:32:13.249 --> 02:32:21.072]  And when you get the new film Order of Death, you get absolutely free the re-edited, remastered, updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the same DVD or same VHS.
[02:32:21.653 --> 02:32:25.034]  If you order today, we are shipping stuff out the same day it comes in now.
[02:32:25.554 --> 02:32:27.355]  If you order today, it's UPS ground.
[02:32:27.675 --> 02:32:29.776]  A good chance you'll get it before Christmas.
[02:32:32.617 --> 02:32:39.520]  And if you want to give it as a gift, just go give us the address of where you want the videos and books you order off Infowars.com.
[02:32:41.065 --> 02:32:41.686]  We're good to go.
[02:32:48.835 --> 02:32:55.077]  If you put a comment in the comment section, we can send that comment to that friend or family member with the box.
[02:32:55.117 --> 02:32:56.258]  You can say, here's your gift.
[02:32:56.698 --> 02:33:01.940]  If you order it today, I mean, it might get to them the day before Christmas, might get to them the day after Christmas, I don't know.
[02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:04.061]  But it's a great gift to give.
[02:33:04.161 --> 02:33:07.642]  Or just order a bunch for yourself and then give them as gifts when you get them.
[02:33:08.583 --> 02:33:09.663]  It is so important.
[02:33:09.703 --> 02:33:12.084]  And the specials we're offering just go to the first of the year.
[02:33:12.734 --> 02:33:15.616]  We're talking, in some cases, 75 plus percent off.
[02:33:16.077 --> 02:33:17.018]  T-shirts that are normally $20, $9.95.
[02:33:17.318 --> 02:33:19.520]  DVDs that are normally $24.95, $5.95.
[02:33:20.921 --> 02:33:25.845]  I mean, that's the type of specials we're talking about.
[02:33:26.586 --> 02:33:34.192]  Almost a half a year free, five plus months free, on yearly subscriptions to prisonplanet.tv when you get them.
[02:33:34.981 --> 02:33:42.848]  So be sure and go to prisonplanet.tv and take advantage of that yearly subscription special where you get almost six months free when you get a yearly subscription.
[02:33:42.888 --> 02:33:45.030]  Or get a trial one-month subscription for $5.95.
[02:33:45.891 --> 02:33:48.954]  But that's 15 cents a day or 19 cents a day.
[02:33:48.974 --> 02:33:54.478]  And then if you get the one-year free, what is it, about 10 cents a day or less?
[02:33:54.538 --> 02:33:56.380]  I mean, come on, a cup of coffee is like $1.50 now.
[02:33:57.782 --> 02:34:05.309]  And all my films, my book, Paul Watson's work, all my TV reports, all my best audio interviews, prisonplanet.tv, best deal on the web.
[02:34:06.802 --> 02:34:15.524]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, Wayne, I was talking to you during the break, of course, you formerly worked there with the NSA, about what you thought was most important, and you mentioned a few of those.
[02:34:16.304 --> 02:34:18.604]  You mentioned the 10,000 enemies list.
[02:34:19.364 --> 02:34:23.885]  I mean, we have the no-fly list now of hundreds of thousands, and now they're going to have a criminal list.
[02:34:24.485 --> 02:34:25.586]  Go over that for us, please.
[02:34:26.046 --> 02:34:32.167]  Well, it's being reported, and I heard this before, that the White House has an enemies list.
[02:34:32.187 --> 02:34:33.347]  Now, Nixon had one, but he
[02:34:33.891 --> 02:34:34.391]  We're good to go.
[02:34:34.592 --> 02:34:35.152]  We're good to go.
[02:34:52.103 --> 02:34:52.883]  We're good to go.
[02:35:14.276 --> 02:35:19.740]  Yeah, I mean, so this, the problem is where do they get the information to populate this database?
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:29.627]  Apparently this was started by Roe when he was in Texas politics, but now it's been added to by FBI agents using these national security letters to go get information from
[02:35:30.037 --> 02:35:32.479]  Phone companies, credit card companies.
[02:35:32.519 --> 02:35:36.343]  And of course, these FBI files are famous for being full of complete baloney.
[02:35:36.943 --> 02:35:49.394]  Oh, absolutely, because it's raw information, and people, when they're confronted by one of these agents, tend to freeze up and say things that may or may not be true, or at least exaggerate.
[02:35:49.855 --> 02:35:52.737]  And it's like what happened during the McCarthy era.
[02:35:52.798 --> 02:35:56.281]  So yeah, I mean, this is the nature of this beast, but...
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:06.544]  But I do know that people in the Pentagon and in the NSA and in the CIA, the ones that do the work, not the high up.
[02:36:07.554 --> 02:36:17.778]  The political types are getting very concerned about what's happened because understand that they grew up in an environment of post-Watergate with all the controls and restraints that were put on these agencies.
[02:36:18.078 --> 02:36:20.659]  And they knew they could go to jail if they violated these laws.
[02:36:20.699 --> 02:36:29.302]  And now they see this administration... Well, they've also got to be looking... Because it's one thing to be dumbed down, American, six-pack, Sally Soccer Mom, wants to be stupid.
[02:36:30.102 --> 02:36:36.685]  And even a lot of people who've been neoconish, who I've talked to in government, are now actually getting to see what the final plan is.
[02:36:36.745 --> 02:36:37.906]  It really is FEMA camps.
[02:36:37.986 --> 02:36:39.426]  It really is martial law.
[02:36:39.466 --> 02:36:40.667]  It really is dictatorship.
[02:36:40.707 --> 02:36:45.109]  I mean, I had Bob Barr on a week ago, a little over, and he actually said, well, can we have martial law?
[02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:47.409]  And he said, yeah, I think dictatorship's a real danger.
[02:36:47.430 --> 02:36:51.351]  I mean, when Bob Barr's talking like that, Wayne, it's not very hard.
[02:36:51.411 --> 02:36:52.612]  I mean, it's getting pretty obvious.
[02:36:52.872 --> 02:36:53.532]  Well, that's right.
[02:36:53.592 --> 02:36:57.974]  And, I mean, Barr used to work at the CIA, so he knows about the laws and what...
[02:36:58.402 --> 02:36:59.303]  We're good to go.
[02:36:59.363 --> 02:36:59.983]  We're good to go.
[02:37:18.092 --> 02:37:35.165]  Went to the NSA, and then he's been set up in his phony... He took two boxes of classified material home in broad daylight out of the most heavily guarded complex in the world, the National Security Agency of Fort Meade, Maryland.
[02:37:35.486 --> 02:37:42.291]  The reason he did this to them is that he authored an intelligence report that said there were no WMDs in Iraq.
[02:37:42.331 --> 02:37:43.612]  His name was on it when it reached...
[02:37:44.585 --> 02:37:47.347]  Dick Cheney's office.
[02:37:47.407 --> 02:37:51.751]  And, you know, Dick Cheney is starting to look more and more like Dr. Evil in this whole thing.
[02:37:52.051 --> 02:38:05.700]  Well, but what about the Army colonel who was in military intelligence who saw clearly that they had been blocked from stopping Alciada, and so he releases this, and now they go, well, you had $65.
[02:38:06.601 --> 02:38:12.144]  I mean, don't they know they're in danger of backfiring with their own government minions when they start persecuting innocent people?
[02:38:12.164 --> 02:38:15.446]  Yeah, Colonel Tony Schaefer is the one you're mentioning.
[02:38:15.506 --> 02:38:17.867]  And look, these people are starting to organize.
[02:38:18.087 --> 02:38:20.428]  They're organizing the National Security Whistleblower's
[02:38:36.361 --> 02:38:38.423]  I think it's going to be devastating.
[02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:16.098]  Well, that is the good news, that the White House, that the Vice President's office with Pooter Libby, and that's what's his nickname for him, they all have a feces name, that's how sick he is, that Pooter Libby, that they have to manufacture it themselves.
[02:39:17.238 --> 02:39:17.818]  Well, that's it.
[02:39:17.878 --> 02:39:19.279]  I mean, that's administration.
[02:39:20.344 --> 02:39:22.406]  Particularly the Cheney office.
[02:39:22.446 --> 02:39:28.890]  Now, Cheney's office also was the scene of a Filipino espionage ring, which is conveniently dropped off the radar screen.
[02:39:29.351 --> 02:39:29.791]  That's right.
[02:39:29.831 --> 02:39:35.435]  Israeli, German, Filipino, any type of real espionage is just fine.
[02:39:35.455 --> 02:39:37.256]  It's just wonderful.
[02:39:37.296 --> 02:39:39.838]  But, oh, you called your wife with your government phone.
[02:39:40.218 --> 02:39:40.739]  That's right.
[02:39:40.799 --> 02:39:41.219]  That's right.
[02:39:41.539 --> 02:39:48.104]  This was obviously an attempt to get classified information to the Philippine opposition so they could use it in a
[02:39:48.544 --> 02:39:49.285]  Well speaking of...
[02:40:07.131 --> 02:40:08.372]  Of the Philippines, something I never talk about.
[02:40:08.392 --> 02:40:20.478]  It was in their big major papers, what, three years ago, that their own military took over a shopping mall, didn't hurt anybody, and just said, look, we've been ordered to cover up terror attacks and these Muslim terrorists are really CIA.
[02:40:20.818 --> 02:40:22.159]  We're tired of our men being killed.
[02:40:22.199 --> 02:40:23.420]  There's no terror threat here.
[02:40:24.512 --> 02:40:27.754]  I mean, just to get the word out, you know, like a movie.
[02:40:29.075 --> 02:40:30.556]  That's how obvious this is, Wayne.
[02:40:30.976 --> 02:40:45.286]  Well, yeah, and you know, the whole false flag operations, what they call these, you know, I still have a lot of questions about the arson in France, the London Underground attacks, the bombings there.
[02:40:47.346 --> 02:40:50.628]  There are people who engage in these false flag activities.
[02:40:50.688 --> 02:40:52.189]  Well, they'll get something started.
[02:40:52.529 --> 02:40:59.774]  We caught British intelligence, that's what SAS is, Special Air Service, dressed up like Arabs running around shooting people with bombs.
[02:41:00.194 --> 02:41:00.775]  Well, that's right.
[02:41:01.255 --> 02:41:05.457]  And God knows who's behind some of these terrorist attacks in Iraq.
[02:41:05.477 --> 02:41:09.060]  Three separate times they've caught Israelis dressed up, shooting at Marines.
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:13.982]  The Marines catch them, beat them up, kill them sometimes, and then are ordered to release them.
[02:41:14.183 --> 02:41:17.184]  Now, why, Wayne, would they have Israeli units going around killing our own troops?
[02:41:17.224 --> 02:41:19.285]  Well, does our government make more money over there?
[02:41:19.506 --> 02:41:21.006]  Were there a year, or were there ten?
[02:41:21.467 --> 02:41:22.367]  Well, that's it.
[02:41:22.427 --> 02:41:28.551]  I mean, and then we've got these private military contractors in Iraq that are ex-mercenaries from South Africa...
[02:41:29.441 --> 02:41:30.002]  I think so.
[02:41:38.570 --> 02:41:45.894]  The worst filth in the world are now working in Iraq, supposedly for this Iraqi puppet regime we've installed.
[02:41:45.914 --> 02:41:54.899]  Well, we've gone from one Iraqi puppet regime where Christians and Jews were left alone to one where they're going to have the jihadist Shiites running the entire country.
[02:41:55.399 --> 02:41:55.899]  That's right.
[02:41:55.959 --> 02:41:56.399]  That's right.
[02:41:56.599 --> 02:42:01.042]  Basically, Iraq will become a province of Iran.
[02:42:01.062 --> 02:42:03.243]  Some people are already calling it Western Iran.
[02:42:03.663 --> 02:42:06.185]  And that's what this crowd of neocons has done.
[02:42:06.245 --> 02:42:07.025]  Now they want to nuke
[02:42:07.458 --> 02:42:07.898]  Here's the problem.
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:35.607]  I mean, I hope that their system is just falling apart, both giving three press conferences in three days.
[02:42:36.028 --> 02:42:37.891]  He doesn't usually give about five a year.
[02:42:39.113 --> 02:42:40.635]  But I'm a little confused here.
[02:42:40.655 --> 02:42:44.461]  I mean, it looks to me like what I'm getting is that they're going to let the Patriot Act expire.
[02:42:45.345 --> 02:42:45.705]  We're good to go.
[02:43:15.285 --> 02:43:16.747]  I mean, you see them setting that up, Wayne.
[02:43:17.008 --> 02:43:19.191]  Well, look, I don't put anything past these people.
[02:43:19.211 --> 02:43:19.852]  They're insane.
[02:43:20.172 --> 02:43:25.901]  Any administration who would out not only a covert CIA agent, but her entire network that was trying to stop the flow of
[02:43:26.548 --> 02:43:42.298]  Of WMDs, and including an attempt to salt VX nerve gas into Iraq from U.S.-controlled Kurdistan before the war, definitely tells me that that's how far they would go.
[02:43:42.478 --> 02:43:45.580]  I want to play this Bush clip.
[02:43:46.401 --> 02:43:48.442]  Play the green-skinned puppet plays.
[02:43:48.482 --> 02:43:48.902]  Go ahead.
[02:43:49.583 --> 02:43:52.625]  There's a process that goes on inside the Justice Department.
[02:43:54.246 --> 02:43:54.326]  And...
[02:43:55.546 --> 02:43:56.927]  I presume about leaks.
[02:43:57.887 --> 02:43:59.908]  I presume that process is moving forward.
[02:44:02.229 --> 02:44:11.413]  My personal opinion is it was a shameful act for someone to disclose this very important program in time of war.
[02:44:11.593 --> 02:44:12.474]  You're shameful!
[02:44:14.695 --> 02:44:19.097]  The fact that we're discussing this program is helping the enemy.
[02:44:20.037 --> 02:44:20.917]  Oh, you the criminal?
[02:44:21.358 --> 02:44:22.078]  You gotta understand
[02:44:22.904 --> 02:44:28.366]  And I hope the American people understand, there is still an enemy that would like to strike the United States of America.
[02:44:28.566 --> 02:44:29.786]  We know you are very dangerous.
[02:44:30.247 --> 02:44:31.087]  You are very dangerous.
[02:44:32.067 --> 02:44:44.051]  And, you know, the discussion about how we try to find them will enable them to adjust.
[02:44:46.512 --> 02:44:51.054]  Now, I can understand you asking these questions, and if I were you, I'd be asking me these questions too.
[02:44:53.613 --> 02:45:02.302]  But it is a shameful act by somebody who has got secrets of the United States government and feels like they need to disclose them publicly.
[02:45:03.283 --> 02:45:06.487]  Okay, let's just stop right there and let's just think about what we just heard.
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:10.861]  This is the individual that said he wasn't looking for bin Laden, didn't want him.
[02:45:10.921 --> 02:45:13.882]  Buzzy Crongard, number three at CIA, said, we don't want him.
[02:45:14.622 --> 02:45:19.463]  Okay, any time special forces have cornered real Taliban or al-Qaeda, they're told to back off.
[02:45:19.503 --> 02:45:23.685]  When they capture them, top generals fly in and order them released, because they're government ops, folks.
[02:45:23.705 --> 02:45:25.085]  Okay, this is confirmed.
[02:45:25.692 --> 02:45:26.534]  This is confirmed.
[02:45:27.155 --> 02:45:29.799]  And then he talks about a shameful act giving out intelligence.
[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:34.007]  It's Bush that really gives out real intelligence, burning whole European networks.
[02:45:34.047 --> 02:45:34.488]  Right, Wayne?
[02:45:34.728 --> 02:45:35.209]  That's right.
[02:45:35.229 --> 02:45:38.475]  And everything he said, if you apply that to the people who leaked...
[02:45:38.894 --> 02:45:39.294]  We're good to go.
[02:45:56.342 --> 02:46:07.786]  Yeah, as if Al-Qaeda, if it really existed outside of the military-industrial complex, backroom creations of the 70s and 80s, as if they don't know that phones aren't listened to.
[02:46:08.026 --> 02:46:10.527]  They're not naive like the general American public.
[02:46:10.747 --> 02:46:24.191]  Well, let me tell you, Bin Laden was talking on his satellite phone up until 1996, and I'll tell you why he stopped, because the Chechen president, Dzhokhar Dudaev, was hit by a missile while he was on his satellite phone to
[02:46:24.591 --> 02:46:26.291]  To Moscow.
[02:46:26.352 --> 02:46:30.613]  That is all bin Laden had to see, and he went dark.
[02:46:31.313 --> 02:46:32.953]  That's the term they use in NSA.
[02:46:33.193 --> 02:46:35.194]  He went dark because he stopped using that stuff.
[02:46:35.374 --> 02:46:36.354]  They use couriers.
[02:46:36.854 --> 02:46:42.656]  12th century communications, couriers, and coded messages written on pages stuck in a Koran.
[02:46:44.051 --> 02:46:46.112]  Yeah, they're using what Benjamin Franklin used.
[02:46:46.752 --> 02:46:47.492]  Right, exactly.
[02:46:47.772 --> 02:46:49.413]  And Tom Jefferson in arrest, yeah.
[02:46:49.493 --> 02:46:50.554]  You ever seen his cipher?
[02:46:51.274 --> 02:46:52.294]  That's right, that's right.
[02:46:52.334 --> 02:47:01.858]  And this is what they, the so-called Al-Qaeda, I mean, I'm not sure they were using official channels to communicate courtesy of...
[02:47:02.778 --> 02:47:07.243]  I'm afraid the next one's going to be this biological thing.
[02:47:07.303 --> 02:47:09.244]  I think, you know, we hear Bush talking about bird flu all the time.
[02:47:09.324 --> 02:47:09.785]  Of course...
[02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:35.017]  You know, here's a person with a bird brain talking about avian flu, but see, this will give them a chance to do the quarantine and the martial law and close the borders, and that's what I'm... Well, that's another Bush... How many people live in the United States?
[02:47:35.657 --> 02:47:41.680]  Bush and others in his drug addict ilk, you know, are kind of cunning like a rat, but they do have really smart people around them.
[02:47:42.501 --> 02:47:45.582]  Don't they know every time in history somebody does this, they end up getting caught?
[02:47:46.477 --> 02:47:49.099]  Yeah, I'm not sure they know that.
[02:47:49.299 --> 02:47:59.568]  I think these people are fanatics and are radicals, and I'm not sure they really... I mean, look, Hitler should have known about what happened with Napoleon.
[02:47:59.968 --> 02:48:00.849]  They always go there.
[02:48:00.889 --> 02:48:02.190]  They always go back.
[02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:14.360]  They refuse to learn from history, and I think this crowd of neocons whose ideological forebears were these people who really were
[02:48:14.696 --> 02:48:15.417]  We're fascists.
[02:48:15.537 --> 02:48:17.239]  I mean, they practice fascism.
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:22.624]  Jabotinsky and... Straussian.
[02:48:22.664 --> 02:48:23.585]  Straussian, right.
[02:48:23.605 --> 02:48:24.425]  Leo Strauss.
[02:48:24.686 --> 02:48:26.948]  These are their political godfathers.
[02:48:28.061 --> 02:48:28.802]  All right, stay there, Wayne.
[02:48:28.822 --> 02:48:30.843]  I want to just keep you for the full transmission.
[02:48:30.883 --> 02:48:31.483]  Five more minutes.
[02:48:31.764 --> 02:48:33.045]  Go to Ray and Michael.
[02:48:33.085 --> 02:48:35.586]  That's all we'll have time to take is those two final calls.
[02:48:36.047 --> 02:48:38.728]  On the other side, for Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.

[02:49:03.755 --> 02:49:05.717]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:05.937 --> 02:49:08.780]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:13.524]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[02:49:18.388 --> 02:49:25.615]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:47.703 --> 02:49:51.826]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:51.946 --> 02:49:54.828]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:54.909 --> 02:50:01.633]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:01.813 --> 02:50:04.816]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:05.016 --> 02:50:07.397]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:07.538 --> 02:50:12.241]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:12.421 --> 02:50:27.015]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[02:51:25.774 --> 02:51:26.934]  We don't need no education.
[02:52:00.082 --> 02:52:02.744]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:52:03.425 --> 02:52:04.386]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[02:52:04.426 --> 02:52:04.886]  We're here.
[02:52:04.946 --> 02:52:05.847]  Tell them like it is.
[02:52:05.987 --> 02:52:07.248]  What did we say five years ago?
[02:52:07.569 --> 02:52:08.770]  What did we say ten years ago?
[02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:12.393]  A lot of you have been listening for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 years.
[02:52:13.434 --> 02:52:14.995]  We're not that smart either.
[02:52:15.015 --> 02:52:18.578]  We're just going off history and the facts and what's happening.
[02:52:18.919 --> 02:52:21.341]  Wayne Manson, I tell you...
[02:52:22.809 --> 02:52:23.990]  I hope it's not biological.
[02:52:24.010 --> 02:52:24.971]  I think that's a real threat.
[02:52:25.071 --> 02:52:26.092]  All of this is a real threat.
[02:52:26.432 --> 02:52:31.718]  We know that certain strategic elites let Bush get into power, is letting him do a lot of this.
[02:52:32.278 --> 02:52:34.180]  Do you think they're going to let him go all the way?
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:36.502]  Or do you think Bush and his cronies have gone rogue?
[02:52:37.984 --> 02:52:44.751]  Because I know some of the European elite, because we've had moles inside some of their meetings, are saying that the agenda is moving too fast.
[02:52:46.333 --> 02:52:48.736]  I mean, where do you see all this going?
[02:52:48.776 --> 02:52:56.724]  You see what happened with Brent Scowcroft, who was put on by Bush's daddy there to keep an eye on him on the foreign...
[02:52:58.510 --> 02:53:03.332]  President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and then Bush fired him after he got re-elected.
[02:53:03.412 --> 02:53:09.034]  So the old man lost his eyes and ears inside the intelligence structure.
[02:53:09.454 --> 02:53:13.956]  And Scowcroft came out and said, look, this isn't the same Dick Cheney that I remember.
[02:53:13.976 --> 02:53:15.697]  It's like he's a new person.
[02:53:15.717 --> 02:53:21.099]  You wonder whether Cheney's been blackmailed by some foreign power or foreign group.
[02:53:21.159 --> 02:53:27.641]  My suspicion is it's the Russian-Israeli mafia, what they call the Red Mafia,
[02:53:28.352 --> 02:53:29.934]  Well, the same thing went on with Clinton.
[02:53:29.974 --> 02:53:31.336]  I mean, they know what girls they're...
[02:53:41.275 --> 02:53:48.520]  The Lewinsky thing and all the other Denise Rich, who was Mark Rich's ex, was having an affair with Clinton.
[02:53:49.300 --> 02:53:51.602]  I think they know where all the buttons are to push.
[02:53:51.642 --> 02:53:53.143]  With Clinton, obviously, it's sex.
[02:53:53.183 --> 02:53:56.285]  With this push, I don't know what his interests are.
[02:53:56.665 --> 02:53:58.086]  Sometimes I wonder if it's money.
[02:53:58.106 --> 02:53:59.827]  He's got enough of that.
[02:54:00.387 --> 02:54:04.168]  You see Jeff Gannon parading around the White House press room.
[02:54:04.208 --> 02:54:06.929]  We know what they like at Bohemian Grove.
[02:54:07.029 --> 02:54:13.151]  You wonder whether Bush's interests don't go totally opposite from what Bill Clinton's were.
[02:54:13.391 --> 02:54:14.712]  Yeah, well, we know what they are.
[02:54:15.232 --> 02:54:18.133]  He likes both snails and oysters, as they say in Spartacus.
[02:54:18.953 --> 02:54:20.754]  Let's talk to Ray in Delaware.
[02:54:20.774 --> 02:54:21.634]  Ray, you're on the air.
[02:54:21.654 --> 02:54:22.094]  Go ahead.
[02:54:22.334 --> 02:54:22.994]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:54:23.034 --> 02:54:24.695]  You know, my specialty is the media.
[02:54:25.219 --> 02:54:34.304]  People should be outraged about this story this weekend that the New York Times held this story for a year at the request of the administration.
[02:54:34.364 --> 02:54:36.565]  That's shameful censorship of the press.
[02:54:37.606 --> 02:54:40.648]  That's real, real dangerous stuff.
[02:54:40.728 --> 02:54:43.229]  Yeah, we have them running around telling the press what they can and can't say.
[02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:44.410]  It has nothing to do with leaks.
[02:54:44.650 --> 02:54:46.671]  They're persecuting people that didn't play ball.
[02:54:46.931 --> 02:54:51.714]  Yeah, and they're absolutely using a propaganda campaign saying that the press
[02:54:52.338 --> 02:54:55.161]  By releasing these stories is aiding the enemy.
[02:54:55.962 --> 02:55:00.268]  Why isn't that little CNN twit, Novak in jail, Wayne?
[02:55:00.868 --> 02:55:01.970]  Well, yeah, good question.
[02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:06.255]  I mean, Novak came out and said, look, Bush knows who the leaker was.
[02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:08.998]  Yeah, well, that's good.
[02:55:09.038 --> 02:55:12.002]  Why doesn't Bush tell us who it is?
[02:55:12.389 --> 02:55:15.950]  And if Novak knows who it is, why is he sitting on the information?
[02:55:15.970 --> 02:55:16.870]  He says he's a journalist.
[02:55:16.890 --> 02:55:24.453]  You know, the other day Jack Anderson passed away, and we really lost a guy who took over the old Drew Pearson column.
[02:55:24.693 --> 02:55:27.214]  These were the guys that would have not sat on stuff.
[02:55:27.654 --> 02:55:31.115]  The minute they got it confirmed, it would have been out on their syndicated column.
[02:55:31.295 --> 02:55:32.115]  Out of time, Ray.
[02:55:32.135 --> 02:55:32.656]  Great point.
[02:55:32.696 --> 02:55:33.996]  Michael in Michigan, quickly.
[02:55:34.016 --> 02:55:35.477]  Final comments with Wayne Madsen.
[02:55:35.657 --> 02:55:36.157]  Yes.
[02:55:36.277 --> 02:55:36.677]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:37.145 --> 02:55:41.566]  I was wondering, your guest had mentioned a list of 10,000 the government has.
[02:55:41.626 --> 02:55:42.966]  I'm just wondering if I'm on the list.
[02:55:43.006 --> 02:55:45.107]  Have you heard anything about gang stalking?
[02:55:46.767 --> 02:55:48.568]  Yeah, you know, I really don't get into all that.
[02:55:49.748 --> 02:55:54.049]  I've heard about that, but it just kind of goes into a whole category that I can't confirm, so I don't cover it.
[02:55:54.489 --> 02:55:55.369]  Wayne, have you heard of that?
[02:55:55.629 --> 02:55:56.229]  No, I haven't.
[02:55:57.610 --> 02:55:58.050]  All right.
[02:55:58.070 --> 02:55:58.930]  Anything else there, Mike?
[02:56:00.649 --> 02:56:01.429]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:56:01.929 --> 02:56:02.790]  I'm sorry, the callers.
[02:56:02.810 --> 02:56:03.650]  We tried to get to a lot of you.
[02:56:03.690 --> 02:56:04.730]  We had two great guests on today.
[02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:06.610]  Wayne, I want to get you up on a monthly basis.
[02:56:06.651 --> 02:56:09.151]  We really always appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:56:09.191 --> 02:56:11.892]  As soon as that new book comes out, I want to carry it, okay?
[02:56:12.072 --> 02:56:13.352]  Okay, that's due in April.
[02:56:13.412 --> 02:56:14.252]  Good to be with you.
[02:56:14.632 --> 02:56:15.193]  God bless you.
[02:56:15.213 --> 02:56:15.513]  Take care.
[02:56:16.013 --> 02:56:16.953]  I hope we're here in April.
[02:56:17.053 --> 02:56:19.054]  All right, we'll see you.
[02:56:19.074 --> 02:56:20.514]  All right, folks.
[02:56:20.534 --> 02:56:21.334]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.374 --> 02:56:22.735]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:22.755 --> 02:56:23.575]  We can beat these people.
