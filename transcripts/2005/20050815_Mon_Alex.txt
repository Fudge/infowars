[00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:06.266]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:07.987]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:09.808]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:11.268]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:12.989]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.351]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:21.874]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:27.157]  Well, my friends, it is Monday, the 15th day of August 2005.
[00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:30.560]  We're going to be here and we're going to be live.
[00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:49.367]  For the next three hours, and yes, we're going to have wide open telephones.
[00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:52.249]  I've just got one guest coming on today.
[00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.753]  We had so many guests last week, and so much news, we didn't get to a lot of your calls.
[00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:59.936]  Well, we took more than a lot of talk shows, but not as many as I'd like to.
[00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.399]  So we'll have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:06.081]  Well, I had a nice little 14-hour day out at Crawford yesterday.
[00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:14.453]  And it was exhilarating.
[00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:15.873]  It was also frightening.
[00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:22.035]  And it reminded me of why I do this broadcast, why I'm so concerned about the New World Order.
[00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:30.318]  So from the Secret Service treating us like absolute trash, absolute worthless garbage.
[00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.821]  I mean, they treated us like affluent, like something in the commode.
[00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.401]  I mean, it was horrible.
[00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.602]  They treated us like the lowest form of life.
[00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:43.840]  I've got that little story for you.
[00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.942]  And, of course, the Bush neocons.
[00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:49.604]  I would tell them, well, Bush is anti-gun.
[00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.705]  Oh, shut up, communists!
[00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:53.086]  I want to turn my guns in!
[00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:56.048]  I mean, just nonsensical stuff like that.
[00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.110]  Or people that actually worship Bush as Jesus.
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.511]  There were some of those out there.
[00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:07.755]  I mean, every time I think I've been shocked, or I've been blown away, or I've seen some new level of idiocy...
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.642]  I'm just always taking to new lows or new heights.
[00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:28.837]  So, this morning in about 20 minutes, because I was so tired when I got home at 11 o'clock last night, sunburned like a lobster, out there from 8 in the morning until like 9 o'clock when we left, but I got back to Austin about 11 o'clock and didn't have time to write an article last night.
[00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:32.481]  I put one together this morning in between getting ready for the broadcast.
[00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:38.656]  And it's kind of a rambling article, but it's going up on Infowars.com right now if you want to read it.
[00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:52.083]  Later in the next hour, I'll just take one segment out and give you basically the highlights, or the lowlights as they say, of what happened at Crawford.
[00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:55.025]  But it was definitely worth the journey.
[00:02:56.025 --> 00:03:02.289]  And who knows if Cindy Sheehan is still out there in two weeks and Lord Bush hasn't talked to her yet.
[00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:19.393]  I might go back out there at the end of it before Bush leaves town and maybe march with Cindy Sheehan up to the guard gate they have set up that itself is a mile and a half away from Bush's ranch.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:35.329]  Understand, there are several checkpoints, and they don't let the protesters get within about three and a half miles, but then if you go past that, and there are hundreds of homes and ranches out there, you're subject to checkpoints or being checked, and people that want to get into their own homes have to be searched and checkpointed.
[00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:45.795]  Bush is out there about two and a half months out of the year, so I wouldn't put up with that, but we just walked up and talked to the Secret Service, and literally, folks...
[00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.697]  The Nazis didn't treat Germans like this at checkpoints.
[00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:52.639]  I mean, just, we are trash.
[00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.160]  We are scum.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.902]  We are not human.
[00:03:56.642 --> 00:04:03.749]  And that smirking narcotics dealer, that smirking gangster, well, his minions are like the boss.
[00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.034]  I mean, you talk about third world patheticness, we have reached it.
[00:04:09.494 --> 00:04:11.416]  Don't get near Saddam, basically.
[00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:13.671]  Actually, that's not fair.
[00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:17.352]  Saddam would let thousands of people stand around him with AK-47s.
[00:04:17.372 --> 00:04:18.253]  They'd just hand them out.
[00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:19.073]  Ooh, what a dictator.
[00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:20.553]  Not our president, man.
[00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.733]  Out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.414]  You drive up to the first checkpoint.
[00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:25.795]  Get out of here!
[00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:26.535]  Who are you?
[00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:27.175]  What are you doing?
[00:04:27.195 --> 00:04:28.175]  Well, I'm the press.
[00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:29.676]  I'm just here to get some video of the checkpoint.
[00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:30.736]  Uh-huh.
[00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:33.517]  Well, you got press corps behind here.
[00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:34.757]  They get to go in.
[00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:35.957]  We're just here talking to you.
[00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.258]  Get out of here!
[00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.918]  Well, no, I'm not going to get out of here.
[00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.578]  It's a free country.
[00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.979]  Boy, he didn't like that.
[00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.476]  Hey, why don't you move to Russia, you slimeball?
[00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:50.237]  You people are a threat to the American people and our way of life.
[00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.899]  We're not a threat to the stupid president.
[00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.499]  We were there to show your checkpoint.
[00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.040]  Don't try to muscle us and push us around.
[00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:05.721]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:10.348]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.488 --> 00:05:14.875]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:16.237]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.998 --> 00:05:17.959]  Can emerge.
[00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:22.241]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:29.224]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:31.425]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:34.767]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:42.130]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.713]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:08.325]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:18.751]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:27.056]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:32.820]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[00:08:05.755 --> 00:08:06.395]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:08.137]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:09.958]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:11.419]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:17.704]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.924 --> 00:08:22.067]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:32.395]  Well, I had an extremely productive and eventful day today.
[00:08:33.752 --> 00:08:35.974]  Yesterday, Sunday, in Crawford.
[00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:43.280]  And coming up in the next hour, I'll spend a couple segments.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.502]  The more I think about it, it'll take more than one.
[00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:50.806]  You know, they say that a good writer, which I'm certainly not, but a good writer just tells what they know.
[00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:57.832]  So, you know, talking on the radio is kind of like writing live on the air and just speaking at the spoken word.
[00:08:58.573 --> 00:09:05.756]  And I was thinking during the break of the best way to tell the story of all the things that happened yesterday.
[00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:07.116]  It was an amazing day.
[00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:09.817]  Quite revealing, quite enlightening.
[00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:26.523]  And I thought the best way to do it is to just start at the start, getting up in the morning, getting pulled over, getting a speeding ticket, going through the whole gamut, ending with the Secret Service treating us like absolute garbage.
[00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:29.529]  Just outrageous.
[00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:31.890]  Palpable police state.
[00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.291]  Palpable tyranny.
[00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:42.374]  So my trip to Crawford, my third trip to Crawford, I was there on the eve of war when Lord Bush was there.
[00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:50.878]  Then I was there on the year anniversary of giving a speech there in the city at the local park to a large crowd.
[00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:52.723]  Against the war.
[00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:54.944]  And then I was there again.
[00:09:54.964 --> 00:10:00.126]  Now, coming up, I guess, here in a few months on the third anniversary of being there.
[00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.907]  Coming up on three years and three or four months.
[00:10:02.947 --> 00:10:03.427]  Four months.
[00:10:04.347 --> 00:10:11.530]  But just, I don't think I've ever had a more jam-packed day even when I was in New York for the RNC.
[00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.290]  So I'm glad I went.
[00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.571]  I'm not glad that I...
[00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:17.636]  Didn't wear sunscreen.
[00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:20.137]  It was overcast earlier in the day.
[00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:21.878]  I'm already starting the story.
[00:10:22.618 --> 00:10:24.019]  So I didn't think I needed sunscreen.
[00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:27.980]  But by noon, I was away from my vehicle and didn't have sunscreen.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.442]  So I resemble El Lobster.
[00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:36.843]  I feel like my nose is about to fall off.
[00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:39.144]  But let's get into the serious news.
[00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:41.685]  And then coming up later...
[00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:49.076]  In the next hour, I will get into the developments yesterday out at El Ranch of El Jefe.
[00:10:51.358 --> 00:10:58.823]  Bush raises option of using force against Iran on Saturday.
[00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:06.027]  He gave an interview to Israeli television saying we may have to attack Iran and soon.
[00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:21.030]  And of course on Friday, Dick Cheney gave an interview to German television saying that they may have to attack Iran as well because they know they have WMDs.
[00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:21.511]  Yes.
[00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.154]  Everyone has WMDs except for A.Q.
[00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:33.762]  Khan, who the CIA admittedly protected when he proliferated them to North Korea and Pakistan and others because our government wanted that.
[00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:37.452]  Iran isn't a threat, the CIA admits, for at least a decade.
[00:11:37.472 --> 00:11:40.994]  They couldn't even produce a nuclear warhead, much less a delivery system.
[00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:47.757]  That's why they've got to be invaded, because they're not a pushover, but compared to North Korea or China or Pakistan, they are.
[00:11:47.977 --> 00:11:52.279]  Besides, Pakistan's a dictatorship of the New World Order, with Perez Musharraf in there.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:59.503]  But I know a lot of folks out there don't even know who Musharraf is, and don't know who AQ Khan is, and don't know who...
[00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:01.983]  Any of these people are.
[00:12:02.223 --> 00:12:04.924]  Don't know who Ahmad Salam is out of Pakistani intelligence.
[00:12:04.944 --> 00:12:09.785]  Don't know how he funded the hijackers for the CIA and how they were actually government agents.
[00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:10.705]  It's all admitted.
[00:12:10.725 --> 00:12:11.405]  It's all public.
[00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:15.366]  You can't find Pakistan on the map, but you'll sit there and bark at me.
[00:12:15.406 --> 00:12:18.426]  I'm talking to mindless, gun-grabbing neocons out there.
[00:12:18.986 --> 00:12:23.587]  You don't know your head from a hole in the ground, but you've got all your mindless opinions, don't you?
[00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:25.528]  And I'm not tooting my horn, folks.
[00:12:25.568 --> 00:12:26.328]  I'm not that smart.
[00:12:26.688 --> 00:12:28.028]  It scares me, though.
[00:12:29.372 --> 00:12:29.532]  No.
[00:12:29.592 --> 00:12:29.672]  No.
[00:12:59.372 --> 00:13:03.574]  But the problem is, I just don't have words to describe the ignorance I have witnessed.
[00:13:04.114 --> 00:13:06.274]  Again, I'm trying to tell the story right now.
[00:13:06.354 --> 00:13:08.175]  I'm not going to do it until the next hour.
[00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:10.796]  Settle down, Alex.
[00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:11.956]  You've only gotten into one article.
[00:13:12.096 --> 00:13:15.217]  Bush raises option of using force against Iran.
[00:13:15.237 --> 00:13:21.139]  And if that doesn't make you mad, here's this article out of WISI Television.
[00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.720]  And Columbia, this is out of Columbia.
[00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:29.341]  Janitors nationwide are being trained for homeland security.
[00:13:29.361 --> 00:13:34.544]  The nation's largest cleaning franchisor held a workshop Friday.
[00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:41.387]  Their janitors are getting trained in how to spot unusual activities, suspicious people, and packages.
[00:13:42.727 --> 00:13:44.668]  They're there to fight terror and crime.
[00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:48.430]  We're really in every nook and cranny in everything.
[00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.151]  Oh, you bet.
[00:13:50.031 --> 00:13:53.573]  From a power plant to a water treatment plant to churches and schools.
[00:13:53.793 --> 00:13:53.873]  Oh!
[00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:58.360]  These are all locations that could be subject to terrorist activity.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.221]  You actually go read the real government programs.
[00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:04.824]  It's the exterminators, the phone man, the carpet cleaner.
[00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:06.765]  It's everybody.
[00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:09.987]  It's the 450,000 plus truckers have been hired.
[00:14:10.007 --> 00:14:14.190]  They had a Homeland Security meeting here in town.
[00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:23.616]  I was even allowed to see the video, but told by the supporters who shot the video, they said, well, Alex, we used to support you when you were against Clinton, but you're allowed to see the video, but you can't use it.
[00:14:23.777 --> 00:14:24.297]  It's ours.
[00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:28.611]  And the video was done locally at the Homeland Security meeting that I should have gone to, didn't know about.
[00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:29.371]  Shame!
[00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.413]  Tattle on your neighbors, tattle on everybody.
[00:14:31.713 --> 00:14:34.014]  Look for drugs, look for guns, look for crime.
[00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:38.857]  Everyone, whether you're an electrician or anybody who goes in people's houses, tattle, tattle, tattle.
[00:14:39.217 --> 00:14:42.619]  But we did get the news articles out of Florida with the exact same handout.
[00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:45.080]  So we were able to use that and show that on TV.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.200]  Imagine!
[00:14:46.461 --> 00:14:52.144]  There's people that support Bush so much that, well, Alex, we'll let you have this video of it, but we won't let you air it.
[00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:54.165]  It's...
[00:14:54.858 --> 00:14:58.440]  It's like saying you can chew the meat, but you can't swallow it.
[00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.061]  But I do have video of that.
[00:15:02.263 --> 00:15:04.324]  Why would somebody give me video of that and let me use it?
[00:15:04.364 --> 00:15:05.885]  It's like torture or something.
[00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:11.748]  It's like the night circle of hell where you're in fire and brimstone and they dance around you with a glass of water.
[00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.430]  That's not accurate.
[00:15:15.491 --> 00:15:17.172]  Dante's night circle is frozen.
[00:15:18.072 --> 00:15:19.033]  But you get the point.
[00:15:19.053 --> 00:15:21.874]  What is it, the fourth circle where they dance around you with a glass of water?
[00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:22.595]  Uh...
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.881]  I'm digressing, sorry.
[00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:28.643]  Bush raises option of using force against Iran.
[00:15:28.663 --> 00:15:41.872]  We have that, but again, this article here, the janitors, I mean, imagine, you pay a janitorial service to come clean your house, and they're there, oh, by the way, getting a cut.
[00:15:42.032 --> 00:15:45.374]  All these people are going to get a cut of anyone that's, quote, brought to justice.
[00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:51.238]  And they're there snooping about in your house, snooping in your
[00:15:52.046 --> 00:15:53.627]  Snooping in your trash can.
[00:15:54.327 --> 00:15:58.549]  Snooping... Oh, and it's only a step away from them planting bugs in your house.
[00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:00.190]  We already have some cases of that.
[00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.251]  And I went on a 20-minute rant about this last week.
[00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:06.352]  But it makes me literally fume.
[00:16:07.273 --> 00:16:11.735]  But Benjamin Chertoff... I'm sorry, that's his cousin who wrote the hit piece on me.
[00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:15.936]  I meant his cousin, Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff.
[00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:19.498]  Michael Chertoff.
[00:16:21.477 --> 00:16:22.937]  All these guys confused, sorry.
[00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:32.301]  He just came out last Wednesday and said, look, we're going to surveil you, we're going to put troops on the streets, we're getting rid of all these laws, but so what?
[00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:34.442]  What do you have to hide?
[00:16:34.482 --> 00:16:35.483]  We're going to keep you safe.
[00:16:37.043 --> 00:16:37.884]  Sure you are.
[00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:42.986]  And again, I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Planet X. I mean, it's really getting sick.
[00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:46.904]  And I have nothing to hide, folks.
[00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.986]  It doesn't matter to these people.
[00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:50.206]  They look for stuff.
[00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:52.768]  Dirty plates, they call CPS on you.
[00:16:52.988 --> 00:16:54.349]  I see an article like that every week.
[00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:58.871]  Oh, someone in the house saw dirty plates and dirt on the floor.
[00:17:00.172 --> 00:17:02.974]  Guaranteed that person carpet cleaning has dirt on their floor.
[00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:04.655]  Probably ten times worse than yours.
[00:17:04.855 --> 00:17:06.015]  And they don't have three kids.
[00:17:06.716 --> 00:17:08.357]  And then I see the articles all the time.
[00:17:08.397 --> 00:17:10.278]  I talk to the families when it finally comes out in court.
[00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:12.180]  It was the maid service.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.321]  It was the carpet cleaner.
[00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:14.362]  It was the phone man.
[00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.063]  The dirty dishes.
[00:17:16.163 --> 00:17:19.365]  I mean, folks, you're paying them to come in your house.
[00:17:20.226 --> 00:17:20.826]  You know what?
[00:17:21.787 --> 00:17:27.351]  Somebody should start a group and you should print off a flyer or like a sheet and make them sign it.
[00:17:27.792 --> 00:17:37.279]  Once you start a national coalition and get millions of us doing it, they'll have to sign it that you're not going to... a confidentiality agreement to come in your house.
[00:17:39.212 --> 00:17:42.834]  Of course, they'll claim, well, for crime, there's no confidentiality agreement.
[00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:49.116]  But literally, you pay these people to come in your house and they're spying on you.
[00:17:51.037 --> 00:18:01.261]  Oh, but if you've got a house two doors down with 15 illegal aliens in it, breaking zoning and selling marijuana or selling cocaine, just try to call the cops.
[00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:03.682]  Try to call them.
[00:18:03.702 --> 00:18:07.884]  I mean, we've got crack dealers here in Austin that deal as police cars drive by them.
[00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:11.848]  Don't worry, the cop's going to pull me over and ask to search my car.
[00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:20.155]  I don't use your dirty crack that your boss shipped in here, hoping people use it so you can put us in your private prisons, part of your big business.
[00:18:20.555 --> 00:18:23.477]  So go write some tickets and keep hauling in the kids.
[00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:26.059]  And don't worry, your kid's going to get hauled in too for using it.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.902]  You can go say hi to them to the bars, cop.
[00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:30.603]  You reap what you sow.
[00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.144]  I'm just sick of all of it.
[00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:35.687]  Okay, I'm going to get to more of this article later.
[00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:42.295]  Every day, I mean every day, folks, there's some new, you know, group that's going to tattle on you.
[00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:44.616]  Keep us all safe.
[00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.717]  Half-priced Colombian fighters offered for Iraq.
[00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.257]  Finally, ABC News.
[00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:59.879]  Now, I talked about this eight, nine months ago with Selle Castillo, number one man in DEA in Latin America for, what, six years when he was down there, 12 years in the DEA.
[00:19:02.137 --> 00:19:12.765]  And, you know, it was in the Latin American papers that tens of thousands of death squad leaders and soldiers have been hired to go torture and kill in Iraq, and here it is in ABC News today.
[00:19:14.026 --> 00:19:18.850]  Of course, lost captives, killing and murdering all over the Southwest, including cops, works for the U.S.
[00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.210]  government.
[00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.971]  We have that documented as well.
[00:19:21.512 --> 00:19:31.359]  You might want to go to prisonplanet.com where a new giant report that Paul Watson and I put together on Friday and Saturday and that he finally completed on Sunday in good post.
[00:19:32.681 --> 00:19:33.782]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:19:33.842 --> 00:19:35.504]  Chips could track car plates.
[00:19:36.164 --> 00:19:40.147]  It says not only are chips going in cars in England, but now in the U.S.
[00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:41.569]  Ah, finally from Newsmax.
[00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:43.911]  First, we told you again six months ago.
[00:19:45.212 --> 00:19:46.753]  We barely beat the bill in Texas.
[00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:48.374]  Would have done this next year.
[00:19:48.394 --> 00:19:51.557]  And they're going to start taxing you with it immediately.
[00:19:52.798 --> 00:19:54.920]  And, folks, there's about 50 other articles.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.021]  They only get worse.
[00:19:56.121 --> 00:19:58.162]  But, hey, billing is half the battle.
[00:19:58.203 --> 00:19:58.643]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:08.643]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:08.863 --> 00:20:13.867]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:14.187 --> 00:20:22.092]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:22.252 --> 00:20:29.297]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:29.497 --> 00:20:30.719]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:34.263]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:34.323 --> 00:20:37.006]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:44.035]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:46.618]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:49.699]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[00:20:49.719 --> 00:20:49.779]  866-885-6625.
[00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:50.740]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:21:01.934 --> 00:21:03.535]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.675 --> 00:21:07.819]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.801]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.881 --> 00:21:17.606]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.766 --> 00:21:20.789]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.371]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:31.817]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aphrodisiacs,
[00:21:31.817 --> 00:21:33.638]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:05.010]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:06.391]  One and the same.
[00:22:07.732 --> 00:22:12.094]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:12.154 --> 00:22:14.376]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.276]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.877]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:32.530]  Here is reality.
[00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.451]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:41.232]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.972 --> 00:22:45.853]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:46.653 --> 00:22:50.413]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:52.414]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:52.714]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.014 --> 00:23:07.077]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe, already a number one beverage in Asia.
[00:23:07.297 --> 00:23:10.939]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.083]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:23:17.223 --> 00:23:23.187]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[00:23:23.507 --> 00:23:27.188]  One packet of Gano Cafe is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:32.190]  All-natural Gano Cafe tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:39.893]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic, you can experience Gano Cafe for yourself.

[00:24:18.883 --> 00:24:22.626]  Coming up, I will get more into Bush raises the option of using force against Iran.
[00:24:22.646 --> 00:24:25.208]  I mean, they've been caught lying about everything.
[00:24:25.248 --> 00:24:29.812]  They've turned Iraq into an even bigger disaster, and now they want to go into Iran.
[00:24:29.892 --> 00:24:30.753]  It's unbelievable.
[00:24:31.254 --> 00:24:37.839]  Moron, every type of service worker you can imagine being recruited by their companies who get money for them tattling on you.
[00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:39.380]  That's the big dirty secret.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.521]  That's what's not in these articles.
[00:24:41.142 --> 00:24:43.344]  That's what these poor employees most of the time don't even know.
[00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:46.987]  That their bosses are getting cash bonuses.
[00:24:47.894 --> 00:24:51.196]  Though it has been in USA Today, still somewhat of a public secret.
[00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:55.378]  The chips that are going to be in your car very soon unless you stop them taxing you and tracking you.
[00:24:56.358 --> 00:24:57.419]  It's mainstream news.
[00:24:57.499 --> 00:25:01.360]  And Bush signs bill creating electronic prescription drug monitoring.
[00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:03.481]  Everything you do at the pharmacy.
[00:25:03.521 --> 00:25:05.162]  Now this has already been in place for three years.
[00:25:06.403 --> 00:25:07.903]  Again, they did it through a regulation.
[00:25:08.063 --> 00:25:11.165]  Now he's signed a law to make it the law.
[00:25:12.307 --> 00:25:14.749]  I mean, a lot of times they do stuff before it's even passed.
[00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:17.592]  It's like all of Patriot Act 2 has been implemented.
[00:25:18.593 --> 00:25:23.116]  They've been doing it for two years, but never being able to pass the entire piece of legislation.
[00:25:23.657 --> 00:25:26.139]  So this is Associated Press right here for you.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.422]  Digital birth ID stirs privacy debate.
[00:25:29.442 --> 00:25:34.026]  Oh, they want to give you, by law, your federal bio scan at birth, biometrically.
[00:25:35.227 --> 00:25:35.487]  Bush...
[00:25:37.888 --> 00:25:41.430]  Slaps down top general after he calls for troops to be pulled out of Iraq.
[00:25:41.851 --> 00:25:44.292]  And, of course, canned one of the top four-star generals.
[00:25:44.352 --> 00:25:45.693]  Things are getting suspicious.
[00:25:46.293 --> 00:25:47.154]  London Telegraph.
[00:25:47.534 --> 00:25:52.297]  This amazing article that Paul Watson predominantly, but I contributed to, that he put together.
[00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:54.158]  The secret border wars.
[00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:56.800]  Death squads in America.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.563]  Mayhem and terror in the southwestern states to protect government drug cartels.
[00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:06.041]  This is the most unreported news out there, folks.
[00:26:06.641 --> 00:26:10.323]  Even border activists are not fully aware of this.
[00:26:10.363 --> 00:26:11.483]  They haven't put it all together.
[00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.444]  This is huge.
[00:26:13.064 --> 00:26:14.105]  It is so important.
[00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:16.165]  Please get it and email it and post it.
[00:26:16.186 --> 00:26:16.926]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:26:17.186 --> 00:26:19.487]  It will not be a big story unless you take action.
[00:26:21.908 --> 00:26:26.050]  Recruiter ads now urge parents to let kids go into the Army.
[00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.851]  They're now getting desperate targeting parents.
[00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:31.116]  President snubs war protesters.
[00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.017]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:26:33.077 --> 00:26:36.418]  Right now, let's go to Don in Arizona.
[00:26:36.738 --> 00:26:37.759]  Thanks for holding, Don.
[00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:38.519]  You're on the air.
[00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:39.660]  Thanks.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:53.506]  I'd like to say that this individual, this neighbor of Bush that fired his gun in order to intimidate the protesters out at the ranch, may be prosecuted under the Patriot Act, Section 802B.
[00:26:55.607 --> 00:27:04.969]  802B says any potential misdemeanor or anything that is meant to intimidate or influence politics is an act of terrorism punishable by execution.
[00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:06.149]  Yes.
[00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.330]  And of course, neocons will just say it isn't true.
[00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.071]  They just won't go look at the subsection.
[00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:14.491]  Secure in their ignorance.
[00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:19.112]  Well, I'm not saying... Now listen, I was there hours after this happened.
[00:27:19.132 --> 00:27:22.473]  In the early morning hours yesterday,
[00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:28.150]  For some reason, the AP said, you know, Saturday, but I mean early morning is Sunday.
[00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.473]  Regardless, sometime during the night, early morning hours, a bunch of shots.
[00:27:32.893 --> 00:27:34.094]  I talked to the eyewitnesses.
[00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:36.655]  I talked to Cindy Sheehan and others.
[00:27:37.015 --> 00:27:43.399]  They're all asleep in their tents, and somebody goes, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.262]  And this went on all night long, the firing.
[00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:49.803]  Which is fine and dandy.
[00:27:49.823 --> 00:27:51.384]  I mean, if you own a ranch out there...
[00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:55.926]  And you want to go shoot at 3 a.m., fine.
[00:27:55.967 --> 00:27:57.928]  But, folks, I've lived in the country.
[00:27:58.288 --> 00:28:00.129]  We've got a family ranch in the country.
[00:28:01.169 --> 00:28:04.771]  It's very unusual, unless people are varmint hunting, to have shots.
[00:28:04.832 --> 00:28:07.313]  And then maybe you'll hear four or five shots at 1 a.m.
[00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:14.357]  when you call in the coyotes that have been going after your chickens or your turkeys or whatever you've got out there that you're running on your land.
[00:28:15.413 --> 00:28:17.515]  But out there, it's Richie Rich land.
[00:28:17.535 --> 00:28:21.118]  I mean, these are big mansions and houses built on big spreads.
[00:28:21.598 --> 00:28:25.161]  And this was... I mean, I talked to... And I was in such a frenzy.
[00:28:25.181 --> 00:28:40.153]  I was in such a frenzy to interview victims' mothers and fathers and interview former CIA, briefer for Ronald Reagan, very conservative person, Ray McGovern, the head of Veteran Analysts for Sanity.
[00:28:41.193 --> 00:28:41.334]  And...
[00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:48.171]  I got a few interviews about the shots, but sir, the news says shot fired.
[00:28:48.231 --> 00:28:56.793]  It was shots all night long for intimidation, shooting in the direction of the people that were in camp there.
[00:28:57.593 --> 00:29:03.835]  I talked to some vets that were there who were better witnesses than some of the libs who don't know which end of the gun shoots the bullets.
[00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:07.176]  And yeah, I think it was certainly for intimidation.
[00:29:08.156 --> 00:29:08.856]  I mean, listen.
[00:29:09.463 --> 00:29:13.946]  We had one guy last week shoot somebody who was anti-war in another part of the country.
[00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:16.847]  I had the pro-war people threaten me.
[00:29:17.308 --> 00:29:18.068]  They beat me up.
[00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:21.290]  But, I mean, your comment on that?
[00:29:23.231 --> 00:29:25.172]  Well, I don't know.
[00:29:25.232 --> 00:29:28.454]  Hopefully, sooner or later, they'll wake up when they come after the gun.
[00:29:29.135 --> 00:29:29.595]  I imagine.
[00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:35.999]  But, I mean, obviously you're being sarcastic saying use the Patriot Act on whoever shot the gun.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:37.940]  Well...
[00:29:38.422 --> 00:29:38.782]  I don't know.
[00:29:38.842 --> 00:29:40.243]  Hopefully it'll wake some people up.
[00:29:43.124 --> 00:29:44.885]  I don't see that they're subject to it also.
[00:29:45.926 --> 00:29:46.346]  Stay there.
[00:29:46.386 --> 00:29:47.747]  I didn't give you enough time to elaborate.
[00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:48.407]  Stay there, Don.
[00:29:48.427 --> 00:29:51.629]  I'm going to let you finish up on the next one.
[00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:52.629]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.649 --> 00:29:54.670]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:58.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:03.990]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.613]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:30:07.713 --> 00:30:08.093]  Shocking?
[00:30:08.193 --> 00:30:08.654]  Of course.
[00:30:08.934 --> 00:30:10.996]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:30:11.136 --> 00:30:14.038]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:30:14.238 --> 00:30:15.599]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:20.023]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott Ph.D.
[00:30:20.203 --> 00:30:21.644]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[00:30:21.924 --> 00:30:27.025]  This 150-plus page milestone gives you more for your money than any other piece of work on this subject.
[00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:40.047]  It should be mandatory in every university that teaches anything about improving your nutrition without all the potions and lotions that are sold to mask over all the problems most folks taught with resulting from the horrible things that are taught as being so good for us.
[00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:47.729]  Also, you will learn about the three foods to avoid at all costs by ordering the book Secret Assassins of Food only from Mother Earth Minerals, Inc.
[00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:50.509]  for only $16.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:31:01.932 --> 00:31:05.493]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.513 --> 00:31:06.033]  are located?
[00:31:06.253 --> 00:31:09.634]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.854 --> 00:31:14.556]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.836 --> 00:31:19.837]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:19.997 --> 00:31:20.417]  We're good to go.
[00:31:20.437 --> 00:31:21.038]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.551]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web
[00:32:02.856 --> 00:32:05.297]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[00:32:05.537 --> 00:32:08.338]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:32:08.658 --> 00:32:12.700]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:22.223]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small, beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname, Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:27.447]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[00:32:27.727 --> 00:32:39.716]  Loaded with xanthomes, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:45.941]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.

[00:32:51.585 --> 00:32:52.206]  Call now, 800-625-2890.
[00:32:52.226 --> 00:32:56.028]  They railed against the crowd Another ragtag band
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:29.903]  We're about to go back to Donovan, Arizona, talking about the shooting incident, somebody popping off shots throughout the evening, just a few hundred yards away from the peaceniks, which scared the daylights out of them.
[00:33:30.243 --> 00:33:34.024]  No doubt one of the neighbors had had a few ice-cold ones, and I'm tired of them commies.
[00:33:34.324 --> 00:33:34.884]  Freedom!
[00:33:34.924 --> 00:33:35.264]  Boom!
[00:33:35.324 --> 00:33:35.604]  Boom!
[00:33:35.664 --> 00:33:35.984]  Boom!
[00:33:36.424 --> 00:33:42.465]  What that neocon doesn't know next door is that Bush wants his guns.
[00:33:42.505 --> 00:33:45.446]  I tried to explain that to neocons yesterday, and they would freak out.
[00:33:46.912 --> 00:34:01.680]  But for the next ten minutes or so, after we talk to Don, then we'll go to Michael and Frank and another Mike and many others that are patiently holding, we're going to be talking to Ernest Hancock, 1010 AM, KXXT.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.641]  And he's got a libertarian talk show.
[00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:06.442]  He's a producer for a libertarian talk show.
[00:34:06.462 --> 00:34:12.105]  I've been on it many times and even had his host on here, but I enjoy talking to him.
[00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:13.466]  Ernest from Air America.
[00:34:14.167 --> 00:34:25.898]  When I was there in Crawford, and they're libertarians, you know, talking about government involvement in 9-11 and pro-Second Amendment, and the liberals let them on the air over at 1010kXXT.
[00:34:25.978 --> 00:34:29.441]  And they've got, of course, the most popular show on 1010.
[00:34:30.988 --> 00:34:41.098]  So, boy, more conservative, what you call real conservative talk, coming out of Air America than you get from Limbaugh, who is engaging in his normal deceptiveness.
[00:34:41.118 --> 00:34:45.122]  See, the real liberals couldn't take over as being socialists.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:49.407]  Scumbag beatniks, like Michael Savage, Michael Wiener.
[00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:51.689]  So they had to pose as conservatives.
[00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:57.093]  We'll be talking to Ernest Hancock about his take on what he's been witnessing in Crawford here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:57.393 --> 00:35:00.815]  But Don in Arizona, finish up what you were saying.
[00:35:00.835 --> 00:35:08.441]  I mean, you were mentioning that under the section of the Patriot Act, that guy shooting his gun, if it was deemed intimidation, it could be used against him.
[00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:09.262]  And I agree.
[00:35:09.582 --> 00:35:17.968]  That shows how tyrannical the Patriot Act is, is that if somebody claims a gun intimidated them, which I believe it was being used for intimidation, but regardless...
[00:35:19.048 --> 00:35:21.089]  That they could charge him as a terrorist.
[00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.890]  Go ahead and finish up.
[00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:29.133]  Yeah, Section B-1, to intimidate or coerce the civilian population.
[00:35:29.913 --> 00:35:43.779]  I know a lot of neocons consider themselves pro-gun advocates, and the precedent that that would set for gun rights, I mean, that he was firing a gun on his own land...
[00:35:46.746 --> 00:35:49.870]  Obviously it was done in bad taste, and I believe for intimidation, but you know what?
[00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:50.831]  It's his right to do it.
[00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:51.371]  Yeah.
[00:35:51.472 --> 00:35:54.555]  For so long as he doesn't aim that gun in their direction, it's just like fireworks.
[00:35:54.936 --> 00:35:55.917]  Thanks for the call, Don.
[00:35:56.818 --> 00:36:01.023]  Let me say this about it, and I'm going to get into the story of what I witnessed in Crawford later, but...
[00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:09.696]  I mean, imagine big, fat bikers with leather all over them, obvious yuppies, you know, on $50,000 bikes, cussing at us.
[00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:11.036]  I would just ask them a question.
[00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:14.216]  If you question Bush, I say, well, Bush is anti-gun.
[00:36:14.396 --> 00:36:16.177]  That's right, you right-wing Republican.
[00:36:16.217 --> 00:36:17.097]  We're taking over.
[00:36:17.497 --> 00:36:18.737]  We're going to get your guns.
[00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:21.098]  I mean, it's basically what they were saying.
[00:36:21.118 --> 00:36:23.198]  I mean, it's just like another world.
[00:36:24.598 --> 00:36:27.499]  Bush has got, you notice, a lot of former Democrats worshiping him.
[00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:30.914]  I mean, they like tyranny, folks, and they've found their God.
[00:36:31.335 --> 00:36:33.377]  George Bush, it just totally scrambled.
[00:36:33.897 --> 00:36:37.120]  Ernest Hancock joining us via cell phone from out at Crawford.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.365]  Ernest, are you with 1010KXXT there in Phoenix, Big Blowtorch, out on assignment?
[00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:49.871]  Ernest, are you at the Peace House in Crawford, or are you out on the side of the highway next to Lord Bush's Ranch?
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.820]  Oh, we're out by the ranch.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.402]  They just had a press conference at 1030 just over an hour ago.
[00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:58.823]  A lot of press is out here.
[00:36:58.943 --> 00:37:07.365]  Cindy Sheehan was trying to get back on message because they always want to invoke the, oh, you said the word Israel, so we've got to make that the issue.
[00:37:07.885 --> 00:37:09.226]  And she tried to get it back.
[00:37:09.306 --> 00:37:09.766]  Look, you know...
[00:37:10.399 --> 00:37:27.351]  I just want to end all military occupations of socially and economically engineering everybody across the planet, this empire thing that they're doing, this gang with a flag out there going around taking everybody's rights and wanting to exploit their resources and so on in the name of their buddies.
[00:37:27.834 --> 00:37:34.219]  And it's just, it's so much easier to understand everything that's going on if you look at it for what it is.
[00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:38.563]  It's not a left, right, conservative, liberal, Democrat, Republican thing.
[00:37:38.883 --> 00:37:40.884]  What it is, is a bank robbery.
[00:37:41.185 --> 00:37:47.490]  This is, all this is just smoke screen to see how much money they can drain from us in the name of.
[00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:56.677]  So you can fill in whatever blank you want to be in the name of, but the bottom line is, the boys that have the control of the power, the lever of power, they get the money.
[00:37:58.345 --> 00:37:59.285]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:38:00.186 --> 00:38:15.512]  Give us a thumbnail sketch of what it's like to be out there basting in the heat with hundreds of anti-war people, maybe ten pro-war people, and then you watch Fox News, and there were hundreds for Bush and a little less for Cindy.
[00:38:16.513 --> 00:38:17.553]  Watch ABC News.
[00:38:17.613 --> 00:38:18.894]  The numbers were equal.
[00:38:19.214 --> 00:38:22.115]  Have you seen that in the days you've been out there?
[00:38:22.375 --> 00:38:24.476]  From what I saw yesterday, that's a total fraud.
[00:38:25.128 --> 00:38:28.696]  You know, I got here late in the afternoon on Saturday
[00:38:29.184 --> 00:38:34.066]  And I have never seen more than 10, 12 Bush supporters out there.
[00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:42.348]  In fact, I went and interviewed them yesterday and said, look, you know, we have an Air America audience that wants to hear straight from you.
[00:38:42.388 --> 00:38:44.789]  I won't edit or anything, why you are here.
[00:38:44.849 --> 00:38:47.730]  What is your motivation for being here?
[00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:53.612]  And I spent probably 45 minutes just talking to them, and two things were very obvious to me.
[00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:55.433]  One, they were really misinformed.
[00:38:55.553 --> 00:38:57.334]  I mean, they just did not have the facts.
[00:38:57.574 --> 00:38:58.654]  They were just repeating...
[00:38:59.407 --> 00:39:05.552]  Did they threaten violence against you?
[00:39:06.493 --> 00:39:07.113]  No, no.
[00:39:07.173 --> 00:39:08.975]  They were passionate.
[00:39:08.995 --> 00:39:15.540]  But once we got talking and I made it clear that if Charles is most independent talk to us, of course...
[00:39:16.095 --> 00:39:19.778]  We have libertarian-based philosophy, but we're not with a party.
[00:39:19.798 --> 00:39:21.139]  We don't have a dog in this fight.
[00:39:21.279 --> 00:39:24.441]  Look, we just want to have a free country.
[00:39:24.461 --> 00:39:25.662]  Well, they were telling me that.
[00:39:25.862 --> 00:39:31.005]  I mean, I was talking to them, and I told them I didn't really have a dog in it, that I'm a real conservative, if you want to call it that.
[00:39:31.025 --> 00:39:32.326]  I mean, I don't use labels.
[00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:38.190]  But I would like to say, well, what about the CIA says Iran won't have nukes for 10 years?
[00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:42.153]  And literally, it was bizarre.
[00:39:42.173 --> 00:39:43.714]  I mean, I had them threaten me, you name it.
[00:39:44.528 --> 00:39:47.270]  Well, you know, I get along with people pretty good.
[00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.691]  I get down to the base facts.
[00:39:48.811 --> 00:39:57.617]  I don't go in so deep as to try and impose my philosophy as much as try to explain to them what their philosophy is.
[00:39:57.637 --> 00:39:58.477]  Okay, tell me why.
[00:39:58.497 --> 00:40:01.819]  So what you're saying is this is what you would want.
[00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:04.121]  This is the criteria under which we would lead the race.
[00:40:04.141 --> 00:40:07.223]  Well, I found what would really make them mad was telling them Bush is a liberal.
[00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.217]  You know, the one thing, that's where we really had an interesting kind of conversion.
[00:40:13.257 --> 00:40:17.284]  These people started to kind of really, after about a half hour, started to agree with me.
[00:40:17.364 --> 00:40:19.948]  And it was on the simple fact that I'm going, look,
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:42.793]  This whole thing is they don't go from the mindset that they protect our individual rights and not use the coercive force of government to take from me to impose their will and the social and economic engineering of everybody because they don't understand that the left and the right are just two sides of the same coin.
[00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:45.895]  It's just what excuse they're going to use to take from me.
[00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:47.056]  You're good to go.
[00:41:05.052 --> 00:41:10.737]  They'll bring a busload of people in from a political rally for Bush or a fundraiser or something.
[00:41:10.777 --> 00:41:12.178]  They all pile in a bus.
[00:41:12.198 --> 00:41:12.979]  They run up here.
[00:41:13.019 --> 00:41:20.024]  Of course, the press, they inform them that they're coming, and they'll be here with people that get the equal number of what they got here.
[00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:32.635]  For those that don't know, for the last three years, this is mainstream news, they have caught the, through Pentagon funds and White House funds, they have these front groups actually out engineering these pro-war rallies.
[00:41:32.695 --> 00:41:33.736]  That is admitted, folks.
[00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:41.339]  With the support of the media, and in fact, ABC, the field reporter national here, Jeff, I can't remember his name.
[00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:41.740]  Morrell.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.360]  Morrell.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:48.183]  He was just doing everything he could to try and get it off message.
[00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:51.904]  And I didn't really get the impression he was a journalist.
[00:41:52.024 --> 00:41:55.646]  After the press conference, I went and asked him who he was and who he represented.
[00:41:55.666 --> 00:41:57.687]  He didn't have the identification visible on him.
[00:41:58.187 --> 00:41:59.888]  And he told me, and I'm like...
[00:42:00.425 --> 00:42:02.727]  Wow, you know, this is exactly why we came here.
[00:42:02.867 --> 00:42:05.149]  This is the supposed liberal media.
[00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.511]  It's statist media.
[00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:08.732]  That's one thing everybody keeps saying.
[00:42:08.752 --> 00:42:12.655]  Exactly, but I mean, you know, all these so-called conservatives are like the evil liberal media.
[00:42:12.875 --> 00:42:14.636]  Have you watched it lately, folks?
[00:42:15.297 --> 00:42:22.142]  I mean, it's pure, but listen, you've seen it, I've seen it, where they would claim, this is important, that there are equal numbers of protesters.
[00:42:22.703 --> 00:42:24.224]  It is not true.
[00:42:24.244 --> 00:42:26.766]  No, it's not.
[00:42:26.846 --> 00:42:29.308]  And the support, I mean, it's amazing they have a big,
[00:42:29.727 --> 00:42:29.907]  300 and 3.
[00:42:49.662 --> 00:42:51.403]  Well, that's an exaggeration.
[00:42:51.423 --> 00:43:07.528]  200 ice chests brimming with Gatorade, and a giant tent overwhelmed with people, and people all in three fields, and a house full of people, and then down the road, hundreds of people, and then you've got ten, seven idiots running around cussing.
[00:43:08.848 --> 00:43:11.389]  Yeah, no, it's not as they are portraying.
[00:43:11.429 --> 00:43:17.331]  We have our callers calling into the show, and even blogs and so on, what they're seeing in the mainstream media.
[00:43:17.902 --> 00:43:18.943]  And I'm here.
[00:43:19.044 --> 00:43:19.844]  That's why we came.
[00:43:20.886 --> 00:43:28.735]  Just being savvy to how the world really works, I knew that if we came here, I wasn't going to be anywhere near what Fox News is telling you.
[00:43:29.075 --> 00:43:30.537]  And everybody else, as a matter of fact.
[00:43:31.227 --> 00:43:36.608]  Again, folks, we were there when Bill Clinton was lying, exposing him, and we're there when Bush and the media is lying today.
[00:43:36.908 --> 00:43:38.548]  We get to the truth.
[00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:50.770]  And let me tell you, I mean, listen, when I was protesting Bill Clinton, you would have mindless liberals switching off their thinking process, didn't care what you said, you couldn't talk to them, they had their mind made up.
[00:43:50.970 --> 00:44:00.272]  Now they're the open-minded ones, and the conservatives have actually scaled new depths of mindlessness and just gibbering froth
[00:44:00.931 --> 00:44:05.334]  And it just shows how this left-right system switches off the thinking process.
[00:44:05.354 --> 00:44:18.224]  And I tell you, Ernest Hancock, with 1010KXXT out of Phoenix there at Crawford, you really crystallized it in a five-minute rant you did for our television camera yesterday.
[00:44:18.244 --> 00:44:19.785]  Can you crystallize that again?
[00:44:20.165 --> 00:44:22.647]  What we're facing, what's really going on out there at Crawford?
[00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:29.217]  You know, I really don't see that the mass of people are in support of this.
[00:44:30.119 --> 00:44:36.426]  The population realizes that even if you think voting is going to make you free, you haven't been paying attention.
[00:44:36.767 --> 00:44:38.909]  This whole thing is a bank robbery.
[00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.792]  It's no more complicated than that.
[00:44:41.152 --> 00:44:50.918]  The people that are in charge of the levers of power now are in competition with other people that want to put a D at the end of their name and be in charge later.
[00:44:50.958 --> 00:45:01.024]  When we have the presidential election cycle coming in 08, it's going to be just another version of excuses of why they're going to steal our money and take our youth to go fight this empire war.
[00:45:01.364 --> 00:45:05.626]  And I think you're doing a good job making sure that people understand what's happening.
[00:45:05.947 --> 00:45:06.447]  If you're not...
[00:45:06.847 --> 00:45:15.089]  Doing the research yourself on the Internet or listening to talk shows like Alex Jones and Charles Goyette, you don't know what's going on.
[00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:21.932]  And you're only getting your information from just talking points that are regurgitated by the media.
[00:45:21.972 --> 00:45:23.432]  We had one young lady...
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:30.925]  Her name is Tierney O'Day, and she was an associate producer with NBC Nightly News for Tom Brokaw.
[00:45:31.225 --> 00:45:42.232]  After five years, she just left because when Colin Powell was up there showing all the evidence to the United Nations and holding up vials and pictures, she asked a question in one of their...
[00:45:42.712 --> 00:45:46.993]  Editorial meetings, before they go on the air, said, well, how do we know what that is?
[00:45:47.053 --> 00:45:47.713]  Can we do some research?
[00:45:47.733 --> 00:45:48.273]  Where did he get it?
[00:45:48.293 --> 00:45:49.033]  We'll do some research.
[00:45:49.373 --> 00:45:50.614]  And she was drummed down.
[00:45:50.634 --> 00:45:52.274]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:52.354 --> 00:45:53.294]  It came from the government.
[00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:54.154]  We report it.
[00:45:54.454 --> 00:45:56.875]  So it's report by government edict.
[00:45:56.995 --> 00:46:01.256]  And I'm going, is this how the first amendment, is this what the responsibility of the press is?
[00:46:01.316 --> 00:46:02.556]  Is this how it's working?
[00:46:02.596 --> 00:46:03.296]  Of course it is.
[00:46:03.596 --> 00:46:11.358]  The media is controlled to be a part, to support the status agenda of these people that just need to have
[00:46:11.918 --> 00:46:17.161]  Well, I agree with you, and I know everybody knows the dominant media lies and twists and manipulates, but folks, it's not conscious in your brain.
[00:46:17.181 --> 00:46:18.641]  I want it to burn into your brain.
[00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:20.242]  They are cynically like a pack of snakes.
[00:46:36.071 --> 00:46:38.853]  Lying and going after you and manipulating.
[00:46:39.173 --> 00:46:48.098]  I mean, at the national ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox level, they admittedly every day get faxed, because they don't trust email, talking points.
[00:46:48.158 --> 00:46:49.739]  This is what the White House says.
[00:46:50.199 --> 00:46:59.444]  And they literally, that's why it's the same newscast, all four networks, in the same order, with the same sponsors, the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.
[00:47:00.185 --> 00:47:00.425]  I think?
[00:47:19.546 --> 00:47:23.169]  I use the reports off the news wires that you never see.
[00:47:23.369 --> 00:47:25.450]  Or I get witnesses on that were there.
[00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:26.471]  Or I go there.
[00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:31.534]  Or I get people on who were there right now who have a good track record like Ernest Hancock.
[00:47:32.034 --> 00:47:34.376]  This is how we break their monopoly of control.
[00:47:34.416 --> 00:47:36.097]  I'm not saying every reporter is evil.
[00:47:36.637 --> 00:47:39.018]  But good reporters wonder why they never get promoted.
[00:47:39.298 --> 00:47:44.199]  Or good reporters get put on, go report on food, or go report on entertainment.
[00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:47.140]  I'm pulling you off this desk.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.801]  And a lot of these big city editors are CIA agents.
[00:47:51.081 --> 00:47:52.281]  That's mainstream news.
[00:47:52.641 --> 00:47:53.661]  Comments on that, Ernest?
[00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:56.702]  You know, it's exactly how it happens.
[00:47:56.862 --> 00:48:02.703]  If you have a reporter that is doing good work, investigative reporting, you'll see it.
[00:48:02.763 --> 00:48:04.684]  You'll look at it and go, wow, that was a good piece.
[00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:07.469]  He'll be covering turnip festivals next week.
[00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:08.991]  And that's exactly what happens.
[00:48:09.372 --> 00:48:11.594]  See, the thing is, I produce a morning show.
[00:48:11.894 --> 00:48:14.077]  And it's a very popular show in Phoenix.
[00:48:14.317 --> 00:48:15.258]  And we work very hard.
[00:48:15.278 --> 00:48:16.599]  We get a lot of big names.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.581]  David Ender's on today.
[00:48:17.601 --> 00:48:18.141]  And it's...
[00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:44.619]  We do a lot of good work, but as a producer, now Charles reads a lot of newspapers and so on just to glean them, but as a producer, I don't subscribe to the newspaper, I don't have cable, I don't have satellite, I don't allow myself to be manipulated by these people, because you'll turn on the network news, and out of a country of 250, 300 million people, you'll have the same five stories on all three networks.
[00:48:44.659 --> 00:48:44.999]  I'm going...
[00:48:45.906 --> 00:48:46.107]  What?
[00:48:47.408 --> 00:48:49.270]  Can anybody just notice this themselves?
[00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.772]  Can you see it for what it is?
[00:48:50.792 --> 00:48:58.321]  So we don't let Michael Jackson or Terry Shrivo or all these other issues cloud what's really going on.
[00:48:58.541 --> 00:48:59.162]  Exactly.
[00:48:59.342 --> 00:49:00.984]  Some of these issues are used as distractions.
[00:49:01.024 --> 00:49:02.606]  Here's an example for your show or my show.
[00:49:04.173 --> 00:49:08.594]  Janitors nationwide are being hired by the federal government to spy on you in your home or office.
[00:49:08.914 --> 00:49:09.974]  This is outrageous.
[00:49:10.455 --> 00:49:12.175]  That's W-I-S-I-T-V.
[00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:19.597]  Again, that should be a national story, but it's a little regional that maybe 10,000 people saw in Columbia, South Carolina.
[00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:20.697]  Here's another one.
[00:49:21.357 --> 00:49:24.238]  Half-priced Colombian fighters offered for Iraq.
[00:49:24.598 --> 00:49:25.938]  This was on the newswire.
[00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:30.179]  Out of Asia East, picked up by ABC, but never on the nightly news.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.280]  Our government hiring mercenaries.
[00:49:33.266 --> 00:49:34.067]  Here's another one.
[00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:36.229]  Chips to be put in our license plates.
[00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:37.710]  It's on the newswire.
[00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.372]  You'll never hear it on the nightly news.
[00:49:39.772 --> 00:49:41.393]  Or we scan the bills.
[00:49:41.473 --> 00:49:44.536]  We actually go to the state of Texas legislative website.
[00:49:44.596 --> 00:49:45.677]  We look at the bills.
[00:49:45.998 --> 00:49:48.540]  That's where we get our news, Ernest, the real news.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.103]  We have a thing called the Freedom Summit that we do.
[00:49:52.143 --> 00:49:53.644]  We're trying to get you out one of these times.
[00:49:54.445 --> 00:49:55.706]  FreedomSummit.com.
[00:49:55.886 --> 00:49:59.710]  We had a lady that came back, Albrecht.
[00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:02.994]  And she came up and did the RFID thing on all the
[00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.890]  We're good to go.
[00:50:30.905 --> 00:50:47.567]  You know, the Cindy Sheehan's of the world, that all of a sudden that the one, the neo, the individual against the collective that stands up, they want to be able to track that person, but there's so many of them that it's a wave of dissent that they're not going to be able to control anymore.
[00:50:48.067 --> 00:50:50.151]  Tell you what, do five more minutes with us.
[00:50:50.351 --> 00:50:52.835]  Ernest Hancock, 1010-KX-6T.
[00:50:53.596 --> 00:50:54.938]  They're in Phoenix out at Crawford.

[00:50:58.103 --> 00:50:58.664]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.879 --> 00:51:05.741]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.982 --> 00:51:06.682]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.762 --> 00:51:07.563]  Alex Jones here.

[00:51:22.295 --> 00:51:25.016]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:29.759]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.979 --> 00:51:34.401]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.621 --> 00:51:41.845]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.085 --> 00:51:44.506]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:54:05.468 --> 00:54:07.049]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.509 --> 00:54:10.289]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:19.532]  The false left-right paradigm is meant to switch off the thinking process, where you pick a side like it's a sports team.
[00:54:19.992 --> 00:54:26.753]  I'm here to tell you that the same owner owns both the teams, the Democrat and the Republican, and he owns the Super Bowl.
[00:54:26.813 --> 00:54:27.694]  It's a rigged game.
[00:54:28.034 --> 00:54:29.854]  It's like Don King owning both the fighters.
[00:54:30.614 --> 00:54:32.775]  I know we got Mike and Frank and Michael and...
[00:54:33.701 --> 00:54:42.765]  Russell, and we're going to get to all of you, but we have a genuine caller that disagrees, and just so these folks that are listening understand, we ask what your name is and where you're calling from.
[00:54:43.205 --> 00:54:43.885]  That's all we want.
[00:54:44.445 --> 00:54:47.666]  But if you want to volunteer, you disagree, and you go to the head of the line.
[00:54:48.587 --> 00:54:55.970]  And he was volunteering that I'm controlled by George Soros, I'm controlled by MoveOn.org, I want your guns, folks.
[00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.390]  I have now been to... See?
[00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:58.431]  See?
[00:54:58.511 --> 00:54:59.331]  I'm anti-gun.
[00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:02.052]  So this individual...
[00:55:03.144 --> 00:55:09.009]  Well, he just issued a statement that he's not going to talk to her because he needs to get on with his life and
[00:55:29.851 --> 00:55:37.474]  You know, for his personal time and so on, I can't believe that they let him say something so stupid.
[00:55:38.054 --> 00:55:39.655]  So let them eat cake.
[00:55:40.095 --> 00:55:42.896]  He's just out there with his three-hour bike ride sucking his thumb.
[00:55:43.557 --> 00:55:45.797]  You know, you almost want to send him a check.
[00:55:47.398 --> 00:55:49.199]  You know, thank you for being so dumb.
[00:55:49.219 --> 00:55:50.599]  You just got to look at it.
[00:55:52.845 --> 00:55:58.389]  And with some humor, just to keep your sanity, but it's so tragic what it's doing to this country.
[00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:02.693]  But fortunately, I honestly believe that the people... That's why I wanted to be here.
[00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:04.354]  I think people are waking up.
[00:56:04.414 --> 00:56:05.275]  I think they're seeing...
[00:56:05.723 --> 00:56:11.565]  Well, they also get delusional when I am rated as a champion by Gunners of America and others calling me anti-gun.
[00:56:11.645 --> 00:56:12.626]  I mean, that is really funny.
[00:56:23.849 --> 00:56:25.651]  It's all, you know, divide and conquer.
[00:56:25.971 --> 00:56:27.092]  Oh, I wanted to give out one thing.
[00:56:27.813 --> 00:56:32.457]  CrawfordOrBus.com, we have audio blogs just continually while we're here.
[00:56:32.497 --> 00:56:37.301]  If they're interested, go to CrawfordOrBus.com and you can hear the reports as it's happening.
[00:56:37.321 --> 00:56:38.482]  We leave those constantly.
[00:56:38.602 --> 00:56:41.105]  Hey, Ernest, do I have permission to play any of those blogs?
[00:56:41.645 --> 00:56:42.927]  Be my guest.
[00:56:43.068 --> 00:56:44.129]  I insist.
[00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:46.934]  All right, CrawfordOrBust.com?
[00:56:47.395 --> 00:56:48.837]  Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff there.
[00:56:48.958 --> 00:56:49.318]  Oh, I know.
[00:56:49.358 --> 00:56:51.642]  I checked it out last night when I got home because you told me about it.
[00:56:51.882 --> 00:56:54.507]  You're doing a fabulous job, and can you check in with us again tomorrow?
[00:56:55.293 --> 00:56:57.035]  Sure, what time do you want me to call, man?
[00:56:57.055 --> 00:56:58.837]  Let me check my schedule, but we'll be calling you tomorrow.
[00:56:58.897 --> 00:57:00.278]  Ernest Hancock, thank you so much.
[00:57:00.679 --> 00:57:01.559]  My pleasure, Alex.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.420]  Keep up the good work, man.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.081]  Take care, buddy.
[00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:07.886]  All right, the last minute and a half of this hour before we come back and talk to the person that's exposed me as anti-gun.
[00:57:09.087 --> 00:57:10.288]  I've been exposed, folks.
[00:57:10.689 --> 00:57:11.990]  Stay there, Rick in California.
[00:57:12.411 --> 00:57:14.773]  You're a precious example of what we're fighting.
[00:57:16.274 --> 00:57:17.516]  But before I end this hour...
[00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:22.214]  Get martial law 9-1-1 rise of the police state.
[00:57:22.574 --> 00:57:28.721]  It exposes the police state, the torture, 9-11, the inside job, the elite satanic activities.
[00:57:28.781 --> 00:57:35.908]  Mainstream news, David Gergen has a meltdown when I ask you about the rituals that he admittedly goes to the encampment where they're carried out.
[00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:40.213]  Get American dictators exposing how Bush and Kerry were in bed together.
[00:57:40.874 --> 00:57:41.874]  Literally and figuratively.
[00:57:42.675 --> 00:57:43.475]  At the same coffin.
[00:57:43.715 --> 00:57:44.376]  Skull and Bones.
[00:57:45.136 --> 00:57:47.377]  Get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, my classic.
[00:57:47.417 --> 00:57:49.218]  Get the other books and videos we carry.
[00:57:49.438 --> 00:58:02.043]  We have a whole bookstore, the best videos and books, exposing the New World Order, exposing this tyranny, on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll-free to get the books and videos at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:02.283 --> 00:58:02.444]  That's 888.
[00:58:11.522 --> 00:58:12.263]  253-3139.

[00:58:30.156 --> 00:58:33.218]  Prisonplanet.tv, an incredible deal, and it supports us.
[00:58:33.539 --> 00:58:39.163]  Prisonplanet.tv, as we defend the Second Amendment, defend the borders, and defend the unborn, because we're liberal.
[00:58:41.221 --> 00:58:45.845]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.885 --> 00:58:46.366]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.406 --> 00:58:47.326]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.366 --> 00:58:50.569]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.871 --> 00:58:55.073]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.353 --> 00:58:56.795]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:09.546]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:13.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.047 --> 00:59:20.170]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, into hour number two.
[00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:24.852]  We're going to be getting to Frank and Mike and Russell and everybody.
[00:59:25.252 --> 00:59:26.813]  We're going to be getting to you.
[00:59:27.453 --> 00:59:35.056]  Wide open phones, and I want to get more into how the janitors now, the biggest janitor company in the nation, is going to be having their people tackle and spy on you.
[00:59:35.785 --> 00:59:36.205]  We're good to go.
[00:59:36.225 --> 00:59:36.646]  We're good to go.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.221]  Right now, we'll probably have to hold him over to the next segment, then we'll get to all your calls.
[01:00:08.821 --> 01:00:10.241]  Somebody that actually disagrees with me.
[01:00:10.261 --> 01:00:16.583]  You know, usually when I hear this, I'll go, let me go talk to him during a break, because before I put him to the head of the line, I want to see if it's real.
[01:00:16.603 --> 01:00:24.045]  A lot of times people go, I disagree with you, you know, and then they joke, and they're not really disagreeing.
[01:00:24.225 --> 01:00:25.425]  But this guy really does.
[01:00:26.406 --> 01:00:28.026]  And I had a chance to talk to him.
[01:00:28.186 --> 01:00:29.407]  I work for George Soros.
[01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:30.307]  I'm with moveon.org.
[01:00:31.994 --> 01:00:33.115]  I'm anti-gun.
[01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:36.416]  I cut off that caller earlier because he was pro-gun.
[01:00:36.436 --> 01:00:37.977]  I thought I held him over to another segment.
[01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:40.818]  But maybe I'm with Al Qaeda.
[01:00:41.198 --> 01:00:43.580]  But let's go to Rick in California.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.281]  Rick, you've got the floor, darling.
[01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:54.084]  Okay, well, I'd like to say that Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, said that the Second Amendment is just as important as the First Amendment.
[01:00:54.104 --> 01:00:55.545]  She was appointed by George Bush.
[01:00:56.409 --> 01:01:01.230]  Madeline Halfbright was appointed by Clinton, and she tried every opportunity to take the guns away.
[01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:04.651]  Let's go counterpoint.
[01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:12.494]  George Bush appointed Alberto Gonzalez, who was vehemently anti-gun, and Bush said he would sign the assault weapons ban if it was reauthorized.
[01:01:12.674 --> 01:01:18.495]  I'd rather have people that are out in the open with their evil than running around acting like they're not.
[01:01:18.535 --> 01:01:21.656]  Now, you told me that you think I'm funded by George Soros.
[01:01:21.756 --> 01:01:22.296]  Back it up.
[01:01:23.857 --> 01:01:24.117]  You're...
[01:01:25.575 --> 01:01:29.137]  Praise of Air America, which supported the most anti-gun candidate in U.S.
[01:01:29.197 --> 01:01:30.198]  history, John Kerry.
[01:01:30.218 --> 01:01:32.459]  That was not praise.
[01:01:32.539 --> 01:01:39.703]  I said, look how liberal Rush Limbaugh is that he won't let somebody like Charles Goyette on who's pro-gun.
[01:01:40.224 --> 01:01:40.844]  That's what I said.
[01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:42.545]  I said, they have one libertarian show.
[01:01:42.585 --> 01:01:43.445]  That's what I was talking about.
[01:01:44.566 --> 01:01:45.206]  Nice twisting.
[01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:45.867]  Nice twisting.
[01:01:46.212 --> 01:01:49.214]  Well, that's the way it came across as you were praising our America.
[01:01:49.254 --> 01:01:49.874]  No, you failed.
[01:01:49.894 --> 01:01:50.294]  You failed.
[01:01:50.334 --> 01:01:50.635]  Go ahead.
[01:01:50.955 --> 01:01:52.496]  All right.
[01:01:52.596 --> 01:01:54.857]  President Bush reopened our public shooting range in L.A.
[01:01:54.937 --> 01:01:55.878]  in anti-gun L.A.
[01:01:55.918 --> 01:01:56.238]  County.
[01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:58.279]  It was shut down January 1, 2001.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.341]  President Bush had it reopened through Ann Veneman on Independence Day, 2001.
[01:02:03.908 --> 01:02:08.510]  The public shooting ranges are treated as all other concessionaires under President Bush.
[01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.431]  They weren't under Clinton.
[01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:12.232]  Under Clinton, the public shooting ranges... But that was done under massive pressure.
[01:02:12.552 --> 01:02:13.893]  So I want you to answer the question.
[01:02:13.913 --> 01:02:17.054]  Is Alberto Gonzalez a vehement anti-gunner?
[01:02:17.555 --> 01:02:19.436]  I do not know about Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:22.297]  Oh, it's good to know that... Didn't you watch the Senate confirmation?
[01:02:22.337 --> 01:02:24.458]  He strongly believes in gun control.
[01:02:24.838 --> 01:02:28.280]  I strongly affirm that I want more than the assault weapons ban is what he said.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.562]  I'm sorry, I have to leave right now, but I could call back if you would take my call again.
[01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:32.982]  You have to leave!
[01:02:33.022 --> 01:02:34.483]  Come on, prove what you're saying!
[01:02:35.003 --> 01:02:40.085]  I have a commitment right now for about four minutes, but I can call right back if you'll take me.
[01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.066]  Let us put you on hold.
[01:02:41.586 --> 01:02:42.386]  Please do that, okay?
[01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:43.287]  We'll put you on hold.
[01:02:43.487 --> 01:02:43.767]  Thank you.
[01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:46.868]  Yeah, he's got a federal job or whatever.
[01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:48.569]  Probably a prison guard right now.
[01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:49.269]  Probably at the prison.
[01:02:49.289 --> 01:02:50.190]  I'm joking, folks.
[01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:52.471]  This is unbelievable.
[01:02:52.631 --> 01:02:54.352]  I was saying, what a...
[01:02:55.751 --> 01:03:09.399]  Paradox, or how apropos that Air America, which is full of sniveling lies and propaganda, just more phoniness, though, would allow somebody like Ernest Hancock on.
[01:03:09.539 --> 01:03:12.201]  I've been on their show.
[01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:14.462]  It's pro-gun, pro-control the borders.
[01:03:16.143 --> 01:03:16.624]  And you know what?
[01:03:16.724 --> 01:03:21.487]  I'm able to sell former beatnik liberals on the Second Amendment and fight the New World Order.
[01:03:21.887 --> 01:03:23.788]  Because they look at me and I'm not a hypocrite.
[01:03:23.808 --> 01:03:24.608]  I'm not a liar.
[01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:25.369]  I'm anti-war.
[01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:31.878]  The poster boys for war just makes more people go join the false left-right system.
[01:03:33.179 --> 01:03:37.202]  And you should have heard the vicious stuff that Rick was saying during the break when I talked to him.
[01:03:37.222 --> 01:03:39.463]  He's not quite being as entertaining now.
[01:03:40.644 --> 01:03:43.105]  We'll let him finish up on the other side and then go to your calls.
[01:03:43.165 --> 01:03:47.528]  But, yeah, Bush, he's real pro-gun, folks.
[01:03:47.888 --> 01:03:49.989]  He just doubled the size of the PATF.
[01:03:53.286 --> 01:04:00.112]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.433 --> 01:04:01.814]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.994 --> 01:04:04.216]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.356 --> 01:04:06.458]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:11.663]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.003 --> 01:04:15.947]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.267 --> 01:04:18.049]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.129 --> 01:04:28.777]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.917 --> 01:04:30.838]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:34.902]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:04:35.002 --> 01:04:36.563]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:48.771]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:55.515]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:55.835 --> 01:04:58.616]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:03.059]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:04.299]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.619 --> 01:05:09.182]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.662 --> 01:05:11.804]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.284 --> 01:05:26.995]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.035 --> 01:05:34.081]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:34.441 --> 01:05:38.826]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:05:41.389 --> 01:05:42.910]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:52.899 --> 01:05:55.260]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.342]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:05:59.662 --> 01:06:00.482]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:05.045]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:09.447]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.827 --> 01:06:14.689]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:15.089 --> 01:06:18.672]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:24.197]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.458 --> 01:06:27.200]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.381]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:54.462 --> 01:07:00.486]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.107 --> 01:07:04.089]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.909 --> 01:07:12.132]  August 15th, 2005, we're about to go to your phone calls, cover a bunch of news.
[01:07:12.413 --> 01:07:18.116]  Hey, biggest janitor company in the nation, 500,000, they're going to be spying on you.
[01:07:18.436 --> 01:07:22.219]  They already were, folks, but now it's coming out in the open.
[01:07:22.799 --> 01:07:28.583]  Cracker chips will be on all your license plates and inspection stickers, taxing and tracking you, automatically ticketing you.
[01:07:28.603 --> 01:07:32.445]  Been telling you about that for nine years, now it's going public.
[01:07:33.385 --> 01:07:46.548]  Bush wants to go ahead and, well, soften the public up for an attack on Iran, and I'm going to tell the story of the circus of what happened in Crawford yesterday, ending with the Secret Service treating us like absolute trash for no reason, because we're slaves.
[01:07:47.828 --> 01:07:50.669]  You know, don't I know that God is in that ranch?
[01:07:50.689 --> 01:07:56.451]  In fact, people outside the ranch, a few of the Bush worshippers, actually talked about him as if he was God.
[01:07:56.491 --> 01:07:58.111]  I mean, we joke about that, but...
[01:07:58.999 --> 01:08:02.660]  I thought, set no more idols before me or gods before me.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:08.281]  I told the guy that the devil comes masquerading as an angel of light.
[01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:18.064]  Also, he comes masquerading as a jittering, stumbling, Kennebunkport, Maine, cowboy hat wearing, gray-skinned little eel.
[01:08:19.464 --> 01:08:21.385]  I mean, don't you have any discernment, folks?
[01:08:21.985 --> 01:08:24.065]  You could tell Bill Clinton was a giant goblin.
[01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:26.066]  Bush is just an evil dwarf.
[01:08:26.726 --> 01:08:27.286]  Evil elf.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:33.681]  But they're all just puppets, and the New World Order controls us through false left-right systems.
[01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:38.382]  The left gets one part of the agenda done, the right gets the other part of the agenda in place.
[01:08:38.922 --> 01:08:44.403]  And each side switches off its thinking process, and they play us off against each other while their agenda moves forward.
[01:08:45.283 --> 01:08:47.283]  But Rick in California doesn't get that.
[01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.684]  He thinks Bush is pro-gun.
[01:08:48.764 --> 01:08:51.044]  Do you like Bush on the border?
[01:08:51.244 --> 01:08:53.584]  I guess you like the $2.6 trillion budget.
[01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:56.185]  I guess you like him signing back on to UNESCO.
[01:08:56.245 --> 01:08:56.685]  I guess you...
[01:08:57.623 --> 01:08:59.285]  I guess you like all the things he's doing.
[01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:02.449]  I mean, seriously, Rick, do you think Bush is a big conservative?
[01:09:02.489 --> 01:09:04.992]  I mean, explain to me why you think I'm an evil liberal.
[01:09:05.593 --> 01:09:05.853]  Pardon me?
[01:09:06.574 --> 01:09:07.134]  Explain!
[01:09:07.174 --> 01:09:09.317]  I mean, you said earlier, I'm this evil liberal.
[01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:10.118]  Come on, tell me!
[01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:14.363]  Well, you haven't exposed the Council on Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission.
[01:09:14.623 --> 01:09:17.707]  You haven't given anybody any specifics to attack the New World Order.
[01:09:18.206 --> 01:09:21.387]  All you're doing is bashing President Bush, and you actually hate him, don't you?
[01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.868]  The way you talk about him is absolutely revolting.
[01:09:23.968 --> 01:09:24.388]  I hate him.
[01:09:24.428 --> 01:09:25.108]  I'm a hate monger.
[01:09:25.168 --> 01:09:25.508]  You do.
[01:09:25.568 --> 01:09:26.548]  You hate him.
[01:09:26.568 --> 01:09:30.149]  The way that you call him an eel right now, and a gray little eel, and all that stuff.
[01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:30.729]  I do.
[01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:32.090]  He's a smirking criminal.
[01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.850]  You do.
[01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.450]  I don't like criminals, sir.
[01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.511]  I don't like bullies I never have.
[01:09:36.531 --> 01:09:39.272]  My way of life is threatened by him.
[01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:43.073]  I'm going to stop you right there, and I'm going to comment on what you just said.
[01:09:43.093 --> 01:09:43.873]  Go ahead.
[01:09:44.767 --> 01:09:46.848]  How long have you been listening to this broadcast?
[01:09:47.268 --> 01:09:54.692]  I used to listen to you years ago, and recently I've been turning you off after about five minutes because of your absolute hatred for the president.
[01:09:55.092 --> 01:09:55.372]  Okay.
[01:09:56.133 --> 01:09:59.594]  How dare you then, because I thought you were just tuning in today and I would understand.
[01:09:59.834 --> 01:10:00.675]  How dare you?
[01:10:01.035 --> 01:10:07.178]  I talked about the CFR for about 30 minutes last week, just in one hour.
[01:10:07.198 --> 01:10:08.739]  I talk about it almost every day.
[01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:12.500]  About how they're pushing the FTAA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:23.405]  I write huge articles about them and about how they have more control in the Congress and how they told Canada's Congress and our Congress and Mexico's Congress what to do.
[01:10:23.945 --> 01:10:31.049]  I'm constantly having guests on exposing the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission and the CFR.
[01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:34.771]  My new film, Martial Law, spends an hour
[01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:40.255]  On the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, and the Bohemian Grove.
[01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.297]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:10:42.857 --> 01:10:43.918]  I listened this morning.
[01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:44.439]  I didn't hear.
[01:10:44.479 --> 01:10:46.721]  Well, all I hear is bashing of President Bush.
[01:10:46.741 --> 01:10:48.562]  That's all I hear is constant bashing.
[01:10:48.602 --> 01:10:50.584]  He never gets credit for anything he does.
[01:10:50.644 --> 01:10:52.987]  So you, no, no, it's you that changed, sir.
[01:10:53.127 --> 01:10:54.068]  I didn't change.
[01:10:54.948 --> 01:10:56.610]  I like President Bush.
[01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.091]  He opened up our shooting range.
[01:10:58.212 --> 01:10:58.632]  I like him.
[01:10:59.694 --> 01:11:03.857]  I find him to be... So the king did a few things that you like in a hundred... Sir, sir.
[01:11:04.998 --> 01:11:05.619]  Sir, sir.
[01:11:05.779 --> 01:11:08.982]  I was saying five years ago that Bill Clinton's in business with the Bushes.
[01:11:09.202 --> 01:11:11.824]  I've had former CIA agents on who witnessed all of it.
[01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.506]  From Latin America, from Arkansas, you name it.
[01:11:14.546 --> 01:11:15.627]  Terry Reid, you name it.
[01:11:16.028 --> 01:11:18.229]  People with real conservative pedigrees.
[01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:19.290]  Let me just stop you.
[01:11:19.671 --> 01:11:21.632]  For heaven's sake, sir, wake up.
[01:11:21.933 --> 01:11:23.034]  You've been mesmerized.
[01:11:23.414 --> 01:11:24.535]  Spirit of delusion.
[01:11:24.995 --> 01:11:25.975]  Listen to me, Rick.
[01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.196]  Let me tell you something.
[01:11:27.496 --> 01:11:30.297]  For your own good, man, I haven't changed.
[01:11:30.337 --> 01:11:31.637]  I'm defending this country.
[01:11:32.237 --> 01:11:33.298]  You have changed.
[01:11:33.878 --> 01:11:34.858]  I mean, you're sitting there.
[01:11:35.898 --> 01:11:38.399]  Your task on this president's appearance doesn't help at all.
[01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:38.959]  I'll tell you what.
[01:11:38.999 --> 01:11:39.740]  Say whatever you want.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.180]  Go ahead.
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:41.980]  Okay.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.241]  President Bush has outlined on numerous occasions the source of our rights.
[01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.462]  That is a step in the right direction.
[01:11:48.682 --> 01:11:50.423]  He may not believe it, but he outlines it.
[01:11:50.979 --> 01:11:51.580]  Okay, what about...
[01:12:09.255 --> 01:12:09.776]  Well, I agree.
[01:12:28.867 --> 01:12:30.548]  I can list like 500 things here.
[01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.889]  I can list a few things that I don't like about the president.
[01:12:32.909 --> 01:12:35.330]  Did you know he doubled the size of the BATF?
[01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:43.713]  And I've had Gun Owners of America and JPFO on, real gun groups, and they'll tell you Bush is actually going after guns.
[01:12:43.753 --> 01:12:44.613]  Let me tell you something.
[01:12:45.114 --> 01:12:48.035]  He's actually increasing federal prosecutors to go after guns.
[01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:52.336]  A doctor gets caught with a gun that's not licensed in his car.
[01:12:52.396 --> 01:12:53.437]  They federally charge him.
[01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:54.237]  He goes to prison.
[01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:56.438]  I mean, do you really know what's going on, Bubba?
[01:12:58.439 --> 01:13:02.422]  He opened your shooting range, some little tiny thing.
[01:13:02.742 --> 01:13:06.725]  He endorsed Schwarzenegger, who's banning 50 Cal, who wants to ban down to 40 Cal.
[01:13:06.805 --> 01:13:09.647]  I didn't say it was perfect, but everybody... Perfect?
[01:13:09.667 --> 01:13:12.548]  I mean, what are you... Everybody Clinton had was anti-gun.
[01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:15.671]  Everybody, even down to suing Daisy Manufacturing, for heaven's sake.
[01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:20.474]  Hey, Governor Pataki, getting a law passed so they can sue gun manufacturers.
[01:13:20.494 --> 01:13:21.394]  Just spit on Pataki.
[01:13:21.434 --> 01:13:22.175]  He's a filth.
[01:13:22.255 --> 01:13:23.416]  Oh, he's a shill.
[01:13:23.756 --> 01:13:26.698]  Oh, but Bush... Bush isn't a shill, though.
[01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:27.318]  No, Bush isn't.
[01:13:27.418 --> 01:13:28.219]  Bush is legitimate.
[01:13:28.539 --> 01:13:29.380]  This Bush is.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.261]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:13:30.581 --> 01:13:31.282]  His dad wasn't.
[01:13:33.084 --> 01:13:34.105]  Heaven help us.
[01:13:34.265 --> 01:13:36.006]  This Bush is legitimate?
[01:13:36.066 --> 01:13:36.507]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.807 --> 01:13:38.329]  Well, what about the source of the right, Alex?
[01:13:38.369 --> 01:13:39.149]  He keeps saying it.
[01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:40.931]  And how did he send Bolton to tell the U.N.
[01:13:40.951 --> 01:13:43.674]  to shove it when they were trying to have the conference on small arms?
[01:13:44.234 --> 01:13:47.998]  Oh, Bolton, who admitted in his divorce settlement about the swinger clubs?
[01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:50.280]  I don't know about that.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.421]  I don't follow all of these.
[01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:53.003]  Boy, he really fits into this crowd.
[01:13:53.601 --> 01:13:55.002]  Well, he told the U.N.
[01:13:55.062 --> 01:13:56.703]  that they have no authority.
[01:13:56.723 --> 01:13:58.664]  They play that little game.
[01:13:59.224 --> 01:13:59.684]  The U.N.
[01:13:59.704 --> 01:14:04.827]  was created by a military industrial complex in 1946 at Presidio.
[01:14:05.147 --> 01:14:06.508]  It's all good cop, bad cop.
[01:14:06.528 --> 01:14:11.350]  When two cops pull you over and start good cop, bad copping you, do you think they're both against each other?
[01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:12.211]  Of course not.
[01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:13.651]  Well, then stop it!
[01:14:13.852 --> 01:14:14.752]  I understand the whole thing.
[01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:17.654]  I'm saying that we can change the direction of the country slightly.
[01:14:17.774 --> 01:14:20.355]  If you disagree with the president, you should have everybody call up
[01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:27.296]  And everybody should write the president and say, Mr. President, we respect you, but we disagree with this policy, and please change it.
[01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:28.718]  Oh, really?
[01:14:28.738 --> 01:14:33.043]  87% of people in this country are against the open borders, but he wants total amnesty.
[01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:34.210]  That's correct.
[01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:38.292]  And that's a result of the NAFTA agreement, and the president is wrong.
[01:14:38.552 --> 01:14:39.612]  Okay, so what's he going to do?
[01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:40.953]  Oh, so we've called him.
[01:14:41.453 --> 01:14:42.273]  Oh, we keep calling him.
[01:14:42.393 --> 01:14:45.294]  Eighty-plus percent were against the National ID card.
[01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.114]  Are we going to be better off?
[01:14:46.174 --> 01:14:49.095]  Eighty-plus percent are against the new freedom.
[01:14:49.476 --> 01:14:53.597]  Ninety-nine percent are against what the Supreme Court just did with private property.
[01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:54.557]  That's true.
[01:14:54.817 --> 01:14:56.038]  I don't want to hear this anymore.
[01:14:56.698 --> 01:14:57.938]  Tom DeLay is going to fix it.
[01:14:57.978 --> 01:14:59.179]  We haven't done our job.
[01:14:59.399 --> 01:15:02.380]  People aren't voting because they know there's a bunch of criminals in Washington.
[01:15:03.109 --> 01:15:05.592]  We're better off with him than we would be under Kerry or Gore.
[01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:07.334]  Oh, let me tell you something.
[01:15:07.374 --> 01:15:12.801]  They wouldn't have gotten any of this agenda through if Kerry was in there or if Al Gore was in there.
[01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:21.652]  Clinton got that assault rifle ban in, which caused a Republican Congress, which they then managed with Newt Gingrich, who's another enemy agent.
[01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:24.078]  You're correct on Newt Gingrich, yes.
[01:15:24.358 --> 01:15:25.639]  Well, I just, sir, you know what?
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.881]  Rick, you sit here and you say all this.
[01:15:28.262 --> 01:15:29.243]  I live this, brother.
[01:15:29.283 --> 01:15:30.264]  This is all I do.
[01:15:30.604 --> 01:15:31.385]  You don't think I do?
[01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:32.926]  I'm totally obsessed.
[01:15:33.286 --> 01:15:35.148]  You don't think I'm opposed to the New World Order?
[01:15:35.168 --> 01:15:36.509]  I know what they're up to, man.
[01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:37.510]  George Bush, look.
[01:15:37.891 --> 01:15:42.295]  George Bush had me kidnapped in 1998 for asking him a question.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:43.560]  Okay?
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.642]  George Bush made jokes about executing people like it's funny.
[01:15:46.862 --> 01:15:50.103]  George Bush wears a cowboy hat but says he's afraid of horses.
[01:15:50.423 --> 01:15:54.105]  George Bush is as phony as a... He was a... He was a cheerleader, man!
[01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:55.965]  The guy is a punk!
[01:15:56.366 --> 01:15:57.586]  The guy is a joke!
[01:15:57.846 --> 01:16:01.768]  The guy doesn't deserve... He's a coward who sends people to death on lies!
[01:16:02.068 --> 01:16:03.068]  And I'm sick of him!
[01:16:03.128 --> 01:16:12.272]  He's a legitimate Christian and we haven't had any Waco's or we haven't had any Ruby Ridges and we haven't had any of these federal atrocities that were committed under the other guy and that would have been committed under Kerry.
[01:16:12.292 --> 01:16:13.612]  Do you know what Skull and Bones is?
[01:16:13.632 --> 01:16:14.032]  Sure.
[01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:15.833]  Do you think it's Christian?
[01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:17.533]  I don't think it is.
[01:16:17.793 --> 01:16:21.135]  Do you think the homosexual orgies at Bohemian Grove are Christian?
[01:16:21.455 --> 01:16:22.355]  I don't think they are either.
[01:16:23.575 --> 01:16:24.916]  Oh, you think Bush has changed?
[01:16:25.416 --> 01:16:25.676]  I do.
[01:16:26.576 --> 01:16:27.857]  I think he was born into this.
[01:16:28.037 --> 01:16:30.938]  I think he actually believes that the New World Order...
[01:16:31.782 --> 01:16:36.586]  Well, I don't... I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:16:36.687 --> 01:16:52.921]  Rick, I mean... Well, it may be, but... Just because you disagree with the man, and he was raised to believe this, he has opened up our shooting range.
[01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:53.661]  He has allowed...
[01:16:56.952 --> 01:16:59.215]  Let me just say this to you.
[01:16:59.235 --> 01:17:01.838]  Yeah, and he's supporting the governor and he's trying to shut all of it down.
[01:17:02.578 --> 01:17:04.260]  He gives it with one hand, takes it away with the other.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.742]  Listen, just for a second.
[01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:10.167]  Let's say you were a happy field mouse that lived in my grandmother's closet.
[01:17:11.028 --> 01:17:14.531]  And my grandmother went out and she put down some decon.
[01:17:14.552 --> 01:17:15.172]  98% grain.
[01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:18.747]  98% good food.
[01:17:19.308 --> 01:17:20.989]  2% arsenic, it's going to kill you.
[01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:24.653]  Now, are you going to eat that because it does some good?
[01:17:26.655 --> 01:17:29.397]  You're arguing how much manure does it take to ruin a bowl of sugar.
[01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:32.253]  From what we had.
[01:17:32.513 --> 01:17:35.474]  And what we got is a few grains of sugar on top of a bowl of manure.
[01:17:35.614 --> 01:17:39.836]  And for what we were facing, we are a lot better off than any of the other choices we had.
[01:17:40.116 --> 01:17:41.977]  Brother, I don't know what planet you're living on.
[01:17:41.997 --> 01:17:46.159]  They actually hired Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the Stasi.
[01:17:46.179 --> 01:17:46.799]  This is public.
[01:17:47.299 --> 01:17:48.680]  And they hired Primakov.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.361]  We're talking Reuters, folks.
[01:17:51.021 --> 01:17:57.624]  And they hired these people three years ago, and now literally everyone's being turned into tattletale squads.
[01:17:59.237 --> 01:18:00.338]  I mean, we're better off.
[01:18:00.378 --> 01:18:02.619]  They're building the cage around us, sir.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.742]  We still have the right to own semi-automatic firearms, which we didn't have under Clinton.
[01:18:08.902 --> 01:18:09.743]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:15.826]  Have you looked, lately, at the price of fuel?
[01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:16.867]  Sure.
[01:18:18.367 --> 01:18:19.748]  You know that's rigged.
[01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:21.829]  Autonomous fuel is used worldwide, every day.
[01:18:21.849 --> 01:18:22.450]  Okay.
[01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.311]  So it's big oil, huh?
[01:18:24.331 --> 01:18:25.391]  You're real conservative.
[01:18:25.411 --> 01:18:26.652]  You believe the oil is all gone.
[01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:35.702]  I believe that we're half the price of what Europe was, and I don't even think it's that expensive compared to what it was back in the 70s, based on what we made.
[01:18:35.862 --> 01:18:36.222]  Okay.
[01:18:36.762 --> 01:18:37.242]  What do you think?
[01:18:38.103 --> 01:18:42.225]  You make a lot more now than you made then, and fuel is probably double what it was then.
[01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:46.367]  Well, you're using the argument that it's inflationary, and that's true.
[01:18:46.508 --> 01:18:48.229]  But the government says there's no inflation.
[01:18:48.789 --> 01:18:49.849]  C'est la vie, Rick.
[01:18:49.909 --> 01:18:50.630]  Call back again.
[01:18:54.073 --> 01:18:57.194]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.

[01:21:54.072 --> 01:22:00.574]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:22:00.794 --> 01:22:04.815]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:22:05.075 --> 01:22:07.215]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.

[01:22:52.252 --> 01:23:06.663]  All right, let's blast into your phone calls while I'm done with this latest spat.
[01:23:06.683 --> 01:23:08.345]  The crawlers have been holding patiently.
[01:23:08.805 --> 01:23:11.407]  I'll plunge into the story of what happened in Crawford yesterday.
[01:23:12.575 --> 01:23:15.816]  As much detail as time permits, and then we'll get into all the other news.
[01:23:17.197 --> 01:23:22.278]  Right now, let's go to, I guess up next here is Frank in Pennsylvania.
[01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:23.239]  Frank, go ahead.
[01:23:23.279 --> 01:23:23.879]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:24.059 --> 01:23:24.479]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:24.559 --> 01:23:25.359]  Great show today.
[01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:31.081]  I was calling to let you know that whenever we make reference to Rush Limbaugh, we don't call him Rush Limbaugh.
[01:23:31.101 --> 01:23:32.862]  We call him Rush Windbag.
[01:23:32.882 --> 01:23:33.622]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:23:34.462 --> 01:23:37.282]  Because that's putting it as best as you can call it, you know?
[01:23:37.463 --> 01:23:43.584]  Well, the guy is no conservative, and I could spend all day explaining how... Folks, just figure it out.
[01:23:43.784 --> 01:23:46.184]  He's just a paid mouthpiece for the Republican Party.
[01:23:46.204 --> 01:23:46.984]  That's all he is.
[01:23:47.824 --> 01:23:56.926]  Well, yeah, he exposes the Democrats on petty issues when they should be exposed on real substantive traitorous activities, and then he covers up for the Republicans.
[01:23:57.326 --> 01:23:57.906]  Exactly.
[01:23:58.686 --> 01:24:03.087]  Here last Friday, I took it upon myself to call a local radio station...
[01:24:03.927 --> 01:24:15.835]  In the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania area to bring up the issue to them about what I heard on your show last week about the problems along the Mexican-Texas border where the travel advisory had been put up.
[01:24:15.955 --> 01:24:23.660]  And we posted an area on the site with about 20 mainstream news articles detailing rocket attacks, bazooka attacks, bombs, hundreds of deaths.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:24.821]  We counted them up.
[01:24:24.841 --> 01:24:26.222]  600 deaths in one month.
[01:24:26.282 --> 01:24:26.822]  I was wrong.
[01:24:27.122 --> 01:24:27.262]  Not 127.
[01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:27.643]  600 plus.
[01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:28.043]  Go ahead.
[01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:33.327]  Yeah, I was trying to explain it to them about this story, and they were online.
[01:24:33.347 --> 01:24:38.710]  They went into Google, and the only thing that they could find out was things that were occurring on the Mexican side of the border.
[01:24:40.051 --> 01:24:40.952]  Well, leave the tail.
[01:24:41.552 --> 01:24:45.135]  Right there on the page we created is Dallas Morning News, Brownsville paper.
[01:24:45.735 --> 01:24:48.397]  We have a huge article today out full of hyperlinks.
[01:24:49.423 --> 01:24:54.847]  Well, you know, sometimes I would really like to get your participation involved with that station.
[01:24:55.067 --> 01:24:58.690]  You give them a call, and the thing is... Well, here's the deal.
[01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:01.692]  I literally do so many interviews, I barely have time to even have a family life.
[01:25:02.173 --> 01:25:04.334]  If they call me, if they want to do an interview, I'll do one.
[01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:08.077]  I'll have to get through to them to contact them and let them know that...
[01:25:08.838 --> 01:25:10.659]  Do you want to find out more about that story?
[01:25:10.699 --> 01:25:12.279]  I know a person who you can contact.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.841]  Look, if they want to dig and find it, they can.
[01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:17.281]  That's the point of the story.
[01:25:17.602 --> 01:25:20.283]  It's all broken up in an article here, an article there.
[01:25:20.623 --> 01:25:24.344]  It's being buried under the rug, and it's suppressed, and they don't want no one to know about it.
[01:25:24.364 --> 01:25:24.945]  Well, we've done it.
[01:25:25.005 --> 01:25:32.948]  Paul Watson gets most of the credit, but Paul and I put together a six-page article of about 20 hyperlinks right now today.
[01:25:33.368 --> 01:25:36.009]  Every claim is a link to Documents Mainstream News.
[01:25:37.302 --> 01:25:40.667]  All the stuff that was buried, it's on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:25:41.147 --> 01:25:47.376]  And I've seen your films, Police State 2000 and 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and I'll tell you, those are excellent films.
[01:25:47.396 --> 01:25:50.320]  They should be put out in the public education systems.
[01:25:51.602 --> 01:25:54.544]  A lot of teachers are showing them, and I'm getting in trouble sometimes.
[01:25:54.584 --> 01:25:56.024]  A lot of colleges are showing them.
[01:25:56.064 --> 01:25:58.726]  We're smashing the false left-right paradigm.
[01:25:58.766 --> 01:26:02.828]  Thanks for the call, my friend, and thank you for calling other talk shows and what you're doing.
[01:26:04.008 --> 01:26:07.570]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Maryland.
[01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:08.471]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:10.211]  Hey, great show, Alex.
[01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:13.833]  It's really a pleasure and a privilege to talk on the show today.
[01:26:14.033 --> 01:26:15.174]  It's a privilege to talk to you.
[01:26:15.234 --> 01:26:16.154]  Thank you for calling.
[01:26:16.174 --> 01:26:17.075]  Thank you for being involved.
[01:26:17.275 --> 01:26:19.336]  What do you think of that caller two callers ago?
[01:26:19.636 --> 01:26:21.117]  I'll tell you, I think the guy is just
[01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:23.467]  Delusional, that's all I can say.
[01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:27.650]  But, you know, you really point out another example of how despicable our press is.
[01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:43.321]  Because I saw that guy that shot off that gun, and the way they framed it on Fox News was, the guy went out, they didn't say it explicitly, but it was implicit that the guy went out one afternoon, shot off his shotgun, and then walked back out.
[01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:46.043]  Not firing over and over again at three in the morning.
[01:26:46.063 --> 01:26:48.525]  And then they had some other goober who was...
[01:26:49.814 --> 01:26:50.594]  We lived in the area.
[01:26:50.614 --> 01:26:57.876]  He said, I love George Bush because the Bible says you've got to love your neighbor, and George Bush is my neighbor.
[01:26:58.196 --> 01:26:59.197]  Give me a break.
[01:27:00.397 --> 01:27:02.898]  I've got about eight or nine of your films circulating.
[01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:09.240]  I've got four copies of Davon Kleist circulating in people.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:10.660]  That's not enough.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.921]  I'm going to try to find a computer and make copies.
[01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:24.009]  Well, you know, DVDs, even if it's a DVD-9 like I have, because my films are like three hours long, they have a little $50 DVD machine that makes clones of them now.
[01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:26.611]  And you just pop one in and it makes a copy.
[01:27:26.631 --> 01:27:28.112]  You can make a copy every ten minutes.
[01:27:28.593 --> 01:27:32.116]  So make a copy for an hour every night, just put a new one in every ten minutes.
[01:27:32.136 --> 01:27:35.558]  You'd have six copies every day to give to people.
[01:27:35.838 --> 01:27:39.101]  Okay, well, I'm going to try to buy me a computer and get me the whole get-up.
[01:27:39.542 --> 01:27:41.443]  You don't have to do that, though.
[01:27:41.463 --> 01:27:42.903]  You have the original DVDs.
[01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:49.064]  Oh, so all I have to do is just get me a... You've got to go to a big appliance store like Fry's or something.
[01:27:49.645 --> 01:27:50.685]  Oh, okay, cool.
[01:27:50.705 --> 01:27:52.765]  But, yeah, you want a DVD cloner.
[01:27:53.326 --> 01:27:54.466]  Okay, I didn't know they had those.
[01:27:54.526 --> 01:27:55.126]  It's only $50.
[01:27:55.386 --> 01:27:55.926]  Well, then, great.
[01:27:55.946 --> 01:27:57.187]  Something like that, yeah.
[01:27:57.227 --> 01:27:58.587]  I'll get on the stick because then...
[01:27:59.443 --> 01:28:02.645]  I can reach more people, because I'll loan these tapes out to people.
[01:28:02.905 --> 01:28:08.689]  But then a DVD 9, it takes a bigger DVD, so instead of 50 cents per DVD, it'll cost you like a dollar or something per copy.
[01:28:08.729 --> 01:28:09.729]  Well, that's nothing, you know.
[01:28:09.809 --> 01:28:12.671]  Because I'll loan these tapes out to people, and they sit on them for a month.
[01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:13.912]  And it makes me angry.
[01:28:14.032 --> 01:28:15.893]  Well, you need to ask people, are you interested?
[01:28:15.933 --> 01:28:16.794]  Do you want to know the truth?
[01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:18.334]  This is shocking information.
[01:28:18.354 --> 01:28:20.136]  And they go, eh, I might watch it.
[01:28:20.176 --> 01:28:20.936]  Just walk on.
[01:28:21.196 --> 01:28:22.077]  Can I make one more comment?
[01:28:22.097 --> 01:28:22.577]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:28:23.037 --> 01:28:24.098]  Oh, well, you've got a break now.
[01:28:24.178 --> 01:28:25.399]  Keep going, keep going.
[01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:27.160]  Okay, well, you know, it's like...
[01:28:28.297 --> 01:28:31.339]  Basically, these people don't want to acquiesce to the New World Order.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:38.485]  It reminds me of Aristotle Anastasis who said, Hey, if you're getting raped, just sit back and enjoy it, you know?
[01:28:39.045 --> 01:28:40.006]  Oh yeah, that's the attitude.
[01:28:40.026 --> 01:28:41.347]  In fact, that's a Japanese saying.
[01:28:41.367 --> 01:28:42.428]  Great points, we'll be right back.
[01:28:43.769 --> 01:28:44.709]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:46.771]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.672 --> 01:28:50.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.504 --> 01:28:56.887]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:28:57.127 --> 01:28:57.467]  Why?
[01:28:57.807 --> 01:29:00.409]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:05.453]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:15.301]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[01:29:15.461 --> 01:29:22.927]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping, a 30% savings off the regular price.
[01:29:23.047 --> 01:29:29.471]  This offer is only for a limited time, so call now.
[01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:35.235]  1-877-928-8822 Cardivite drops and capsules may help improve your circulation and cardiovascular health, but that's up to you.
[01:29:35.335 --> 01:29:36.776]  Take the first step with Cardivite.

[01:29:40.718 --> 01:29:42.540]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:29:53.544 --> 01:30:01.810]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:06.433]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.713 --> 01:30:15.619]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.819 --> 01:30:19.442]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.722 --> 01:30:24.772]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.073 --> 01:30:31.766]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.276 --> 01:30:32.917]  What about you?
[01:30:33.577 --> 01:30:38.922]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:53.519 --> 01:30:53.699]  Yeah.

[01:31:27.867 --> 01:31:28.267]  We're good to go.
[01:31:28.287 --> 01:31:28.728]  We're good to go.
[01:31:28.748 --> 01:31:29.128]  We're good to go.
[01:31:58.664 --> 01:32:04.389]  All right, we've reached the midway point on the downhill now.
[01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:06.391]  A lot of key info coming up.
[01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:16.080]  I want to try to hurry through Mike and Russell and Lovebug and John because I want to have a little bit of time in this hour to tell the story of what happened in Crawford yesterday.
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.201]  I've already promised to do that.
[01:32:17.221 --> 01:32:24.428]  I have a little report that I wrote this morning about some of the observations I made and some of the things that happened.
[01:32:25.678 --> 01:32:29.521]  I do want to add this, because I didn't specifically deny what the caller was saying.
[01:32:29.561 --> 01:32:31.862]  I was so shocked by it, I was busy laughing at him.
[01:32:32.683 --> 01:32:38.967]  I am not funded, nor have I ever been funded, it's like it's the witch hunt, by George Soros.
[01:32:39.047 --> 01:32:40.268]  Never met George Soros.
[01:32:40.308 --> 01:32:41.569]  Don't like George Soros.
[01:32:41.609 --> 01:32:43.391]  He's totally controlled by the New World Order.
[01:32:43.731 --> 01:32:45.332]  It's all false left-right paradigm.
[01:32:46.667 --> 01:32:49.648]  I do not like nor do I defend Air America.
[01:32:49.708 --> 01:32:50.648]  I was saying, look at them.
[01:32:51.028 --> 01:32:56.590]  More conservative than Rush Limbaugh with these conservative hosts like Ernest Hancock on.
[01:32:57.950 --> 01:33:00.811]  But are more libertarian, more honest, exposing Bush.
[01:33:01.171 --> 01:33:02.091]  As well as the Democrats.
[01:33:02.131 --> 01:33:04.332]  As long as you do that, Democrats will listen, folks.
[01:33:05.072 --> 01:33:06.192]  You can actually deprogram them.
[01:33:07.513 --> 01:33:11.694]  And nor am I the 55-year-old Alex Jones who was the Scientologist.
[01:33:12.972 --> 01:33:14.793]  I mean, I get asked that now like every week.
[01:33:15.414 --> 01:33:18.496]  Are you the head of Scientology Public Relations?
[01:33:18.956 --> 01:33:21.698]  No, I'm 31 years old from Dallas, Texas.
[01:33:21.738 --> 01:33:22.759]  Born in Dallas, Texas.
[01:33:23.359 --> 01:33:25.361]  I'm not a 50-something-year-old person.
[01:33:26.061 --> 01:33:28.183]  And I've never met them.
[01:33:28.243 --> 01:33:33.507]  And I think I might have met one Scientologist once on the street somewhere who said they were.
[01:33:34.948 --> 01:33:36.829]  I don't even know Scientologists.
[01:33:37.856 --> 01:33:39.897]  And I'm not Alex Jones, the Scientologist.
[01:33:39.937 --> 01:33:40.877]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.897 --> 01:33:43.157]  I have to do this every couple weeks now.
[01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:54.561]  I'm not the Harvard guy, Alex Jones, who's 60-something years old and has a show on NPR and writes for the New York Times and runs the Shorenstein Center.
[01:33:54.601 --> 01:33:57.101]  And I'm not the Alex Jones industrialist in Canada.
[01:33:57.501 --> 01:34:00.802]  And I'm not Alex Jones, the photojournalist for the Austin American-Statesman.
[01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:04.203]  And I'm not Alex Jones, who is a painter.
[01:34:04.243 --> 01:34:05.444]  And I'm not Alex Jones.
[01:34:05.504 --> 01:34:06.564]  It's just a joke, folks.
[01:34:07.549 --> 01:34:15.274]  And I'm not a Catholic secret agent, and I'm not a Jewish secret agent, and I'm not a... I'm a Texan, folks, who doesn't like tyranny.
[01:34:16.895 --> 01:34:18.756]  But I mean, this last guy, that's how it starts.
[01:34:19.417 --> 01:34:26.422]  Somebody on a website says, Hmm, I wonder if he's connected to this 55-year-old Alex Jones Scientologist.
[01:34:27.222 --> 01:34:28.483]  That's the hardcore proof.
[01:34:30.168 --> 01:34:32.989]  And then another website says, I hear he's a Scientologist.
[01:34:33.009 --> 01:34:35.130]  The next website, he is a Scientologist.
[01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:37.191]  He's their public relations director.
[01:34:37.591 --> 01:34:38.612]  And it doesn't hurt me.
[01:34:39.152 --> 01:34:39.992]  It's just a joke.
[01:34:40.613 --> 01:34:45.015]  You know, you guys should learn to, number one, not believe what I say, but don't believe what others say.
[01:34:45.035 --> 01:34:45.875]  You should check it out.
[01:34:46.855 --> 01:34:47.756]  It's just annoying.
[01:34:49.217 --> 01:34:52.018]  You know, my mother says to me, somebody told me you're a Scientologist.
[01:34:52.038 --> 01:34:52.538]  Is that true?
[01:34:52.598 --> 01:34:53.759]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.820]  It's a joke.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.101]  What's the other thing I get called?
[01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:01.210]  Oh, a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:10.094]  I mean, some fruitcakes just make up one time that, you know, why I take money from ABC and I sell families out.
[01:35:10.414 --> 01:35:11.975]  It's just totally made up.
[01:35:12.135 --> 01:35:13.016]  Total theater.
[01:35:13.736 --> 01:35:18.279]  And I make the mistake of not attacking people back when they say that, and then it just becomes reality.
[01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:20.280]  It just gets so old.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.442]  And the reason I'm talking about it now is because it becomes frustrating.
[01:35:24.722 --> 01:35:26.663]  We've got serious issues, folks.
[01:35:27.952 --> 01:35:38.055]  You know, driving back from Crawford yesterday, I'll tell the story, then we'll take some calls and go to my story, but this is why it's so hard to tell a story of what happens in a day, because so many things make me think.
[01:35:39.436 --> 01:35:53.981]  We're driving back from Crawford, and a place I've always wanted to go to, in between Crawford and Moody and McGregor, is the University of A&M, one of their major...
[01:35:56.116 --> 01:35:58.657]  Agri-biotech facilities.
[01:35:59.258 --> 01:36:01.099]  They own thousands and thousands of acres.
[01:36:01.459 --> 01:36:02.639]  There's hundreds of laboratories.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:04.800]  And I've wanted to drive up there.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.581]  I've wanted to show you the fields.
[01:36:07.682 --> 01:36:10.303]  I've wanted to show you the places this stuff's going on.
[01:36:10.963 --> 01:36:11.604]  And there I was.
[01:36:11.624 --> 01:36:19.888]  It was already dark, and I almost turned off the road to go work even more and drive 10 miles to this facility that I've read about and videotaped.
[01:36:20.928 --> 01:36:21.789]  I was just too tired.
[01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:22.369]  I didn't do it.
[01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:24.778]  We're good to go.
[01:36:51.599 --> 01:36:54.200]  Cows, dogs, which they thought was near impossible.
[01:36:56.322 --> 01:36:59.483]  Just all this stuff, and they're putting different genes in them, different animals.
[01:36:59.943 --> 01:37:00.744]  Really dangerous.
[01:37:00.824 --> 01:37:02.465]  I mean, we should be talking about that.
[01:37:04.006 --> 01:37:08.348]  Now, it doesn't matter if I am a blood-drinking Easter Bunny from the center of the earth.
[01:37:08.968 --> 01:37:12.190]  And just on record, I didn't deny he was a blood-drinking Easter Bunny.
[01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:14.331]  Yes, I'm not a blood-drinking Easter Bunny.
[01:37:14.931 --> 01:37:16.452]  But it doesn't matter what I am.
[01:37:16.532 --> 01:37:18.293]  It's about the information.
[01:37:20.171 --> 01:37:21.372]  But we're so tribal.
[01:37:21.392 --> 01:37:23.653]  We're so into, you know, the leader.
[01:37:23.733 --> 01:37:25.255]  And I do not want to be your leader, folks.
[01:37:25.275 --> 01:37:26.155]  I'm not into it.
[01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:26.896]  I don't like it.
[01:37:27.436 --> 01:37:28.457]  I want you to be leaders.
[01:37:28.637 --> 01:37:29.938]  I want to live a safe life.
[01:37:30.278 --> 01:37:31.479]  I want to live a dynamic life.
[01:37:31.599 --> 01:37:32.439]  I want to be free.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.181]  I want to control my destiny.
[01:37:34.461 --> 01:37:36.462]  And you've got to be free if I'm going to have my destiny.
[01:37:37.323 --> 01:37:39.905]  I've got to be free if you're going to have control of your life and have your destiny.
[01:37:40.945 --> 01:37:42.426]  We've got tyranny forming here.
[01:37:43.467 --> 01:37:45.468]  And somebody just calls up and goes, I think.
[01:37:46.009 --> 01:37:46.829]  I said, what's your proof?
[01:37:46.889 --> 01:37:47.730]  Well, you must be.
[01:37:49.307 --> 01:37:50.689]  Well, I talked to him during the break.
[01:37:50.749 --> 01:37:51.451]  I said, what's your proof?
[01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:53.494]  He goes, well, I just think you're probably funded.
[01:37:53.855 --> 01:37:54.576]  He said it on air.
[01:37:54.996 --> 01:37:56.399]  I just think you're probably funded.
[01:37:56.619 --> 01:37:57.561]  So there you have it, folks.
[01:37:57.581 --> 01:37:58.101]  It's official.
[01:37:58.702 --> 01:38:00.365]  George Soros, Paychex Daily.
[01:38:00.385 --> 01:38:01.267]  Of course, it's not true.
[01:38:03.886 --> 01:38:04.427]  It's sick.
[01:38:04.927 --> 01:38:08.351]  I've got to move quick through your calls, because I want to get the story started in this hour.
[01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:09.752]  I've got a bunch of news, too.
[01:38:10.253 --> 01:38:12.575]  Real fast, Mike, finish up in Maryland.
[01:38:12.916 --> 01:38:15.679]  I mean, the point you make about, that's the creed of slaves.
[01:38:15.719 --> 01:38:17.981]  Yeah, if you're going to get raped, go ahead and enjoy it.
[01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:23.747]  No, if you're going to get raped, think about how you're going to get a weapon and kill the person that rapes you as soon as they get off of you.
[01:38:24.047 --> 01:38:25.509]  That's my creed, but go ahead, Mike.
[01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:26.290]  Yeah, sure.
[01:38:26.410 --> 01:38:41.724]  Like I said, I've got you in C-SPAN and plugged you in your show several times, and I called in RVN one time, and they had a substitute for John Statmiller, and I quoted a book from John Watson's book, and the guy, he sounded like a total neocon.
[01:38:41.744 --> 01:38:44.707]  I couldn't believe he was on RVN, and then you called back up and corrected him.
[01:38:45.726 --> 01:38:46.807]  I don't know if you remember that.
[01:38:47.227 --> 01:38:47.908]  No, I remember.
[01:38:47.928 --> 01:38:49.028]  I actually heard that day.
[01:38:49.048 --> 01:39:01.216]  He was on there saying that bin Laden attacked us alone because we're evil and 9-11 wasn't an inside job and our government didn't create bin Laden.
[01:39:01.597 --> 01:39:07.801]  But, you know, I don't think Americans are going to go with an expanded war in Iran or Syria.
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:09.861]  People are fed up with this one.
[01:39:10.041 --> 01:39:11.802]  Well, they will if they carry out a terror attack.
[01:39:11.822 --> 01:39:12.563]  Do you think so?
[01:39:13.283 --> 01:39:13.904]  Absolutely.
[01:39:14.144 --> 01:39:14.384]  Really?
[01:39:14.404 --> 01:39:15.825]  You think the Americans will fall for it, huh?
[01:39:15.965 --> 01:39:18.467]  They know that... Thanks for the call.
[01:39:18.527 --> 01:39:18.987]  Great points.
[01:39:19.007 --> 01:39:20.328]  It's like a heroin addict.
[01:39:20.948 --> 01:39:28.033]  They'll have a month to get the war going, and a month to get the draft in place, and a month to clap down, but even more police state, and then it'll wear off.
[01:39:28.053 --> 01:39:32.716]  Instead of having two years of people, I'll give up my rights until they figure it out.
[01:39:32.776 --> 01:39:35.238]  Now it takes more and more, bigger and bigger attacks.
[01:39:36.038 --> 01:39:36.459]  But, uh...
[01:39:37.245 --> 01:39:45.850]  It'll eventually blow up in their face, pun intended, if the globalists nuke something or release a bio weapon, which I think could be even more of a chance of that, but it's not going to work.
[01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.671]  They're going to lose.
[01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:50.712]  We've got the initiative, and we're going to do it.
[01:39:50.773 --> 01:39:52.253]  Russell in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:39:52.293 --> 01:39:52.874]  Go ahead, Russell.
[01:39:53.334 --> 01:40:01.498]  I'll tell you what, Alex Jones, you are, Alex, and this is not about sucking up or not about making you the figure point, but you always say that George Norrie is the national treasure.
[01:40:01.558 --> 01:40:04.180]  Sir, you're the national treasure because you do this every day.
[01:40:04.810 --> 01:40:11.199]  You're exposing the globalists for what they are, and you're to be commended to the highest... Let me say this about George Norrie.
[01:40:11.239 --> 01:40:13.482]  Just the direction he's taken that broadcast.
[01:40:13.582 --> 01:40:16.626]  About a third of the time now, having people on talking about the New World Order.
[01:40:16.646 --> 01:40:17.908]  Incredible guess, folks.
[01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:23.693]  And then openly on his show saying every night, look, I do entertainment shows about aliens and chupacabras.
[01:40:23.733 --> 01:40:27.916]  He says it's entertainment, but then he says I do serious shows with Alex Jones.
[01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:30.277]  I mean, he's even made the separation.
[01:40:30.777 --> 01:40:32.018]  That takes a lot of courage.
[01:40:32.038 --> 01:40:43.045]  I mean, to have that much, to be on 550 radio stations, to have the number two show in the country, and to do what he's doing, it does take courage.
[01:40:43.667 --> 01:40:44.168]  Absolutely.
[01:40:44.188 --> 01:40:44.508]  You're right.
[01:40:44.688 --> 01:40:46.670]  But that's because the worm has turned.
[01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:48.871]  Also, the people are demanding the truth.
[01:40:48.911 --> 01:40:49.212]  Go ahead.
[01:40:49.732 --> 01:40:53.215]  Well, it's because we're lied to, and people are waking up in that false left-right paradigm.
[01:40:53.235 --> 01:40:55.196]  Well, quite frankly, the audience is with the truth.
[01:40:56.157 --> 01:40:56.657]  Absolutely.
[01:40:56.798 --> 01:41:03.943]  I mean, folks, when one of my websites gets 20 million visitors in a month, I mean, the establishment's got a problem.
[01:41:05.464 --> 01:41:05.805]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:05.825 --> 01:41:06.185]  Go ahead.
[01:41:06.385 --> 01:41:06.826]  No problem.
[01:41:06.926 --> 01:41:10.048]  I had a couple... I wanted to ask you two things, and I know you're running through these calls.
[01:41:10.088 --> 01:41:10.989]  You want to go through quick, but...
[01:41:11.687 --> 01:41:16.650]  You know, that caller before, what we just witnessed was just worship of idolatry of a man.
[01:41:17.190 --> 01:41:19.712]  You know, he said that Bush appointed Bolton.
[01:41:19.752 --> 01:41:21.533]  Bolton's PNAC, for heaven's sakes.
[01:41:21.993 --> 01:41:25.275]  You know, Bush's cabinet is either CFR or trilateral commission.
[01:41:25.295 --> 01:41:25.835]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:25.855 --> 01:41:27.276]  Bush's cabinet appointed him.
[01:41:28.137 --> 01:41:31.959]  Right, and how many people around Bush are either trilateral or CFR people?
[01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:33.500]  Like his daddy's cabinet.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:34.620]  The same people.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.882]  You know, Cheney, for God's sakes.
[01:41:36.982 --> 01:41:38.182]  I mean, what is this guy?
[01:41:38.202 --> 01:41:39.523]  This guy's off his rocker.
[01:41:40.284 --> 01:41:40.764]  But, um...
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:46.224]  Is the footage and stuff from your Crawford visit going to be on your website?
[01:41:46.524 --> 01:41:48.986]  Yeah, it's so laced with profanity, though.
[01:41:49.046 --> 01:41:53.410]  I mean, literally, these so-called Christian conservatives are the most potty-mouthed people I've ever seen.
[01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:56.372]  So it's so laced with cussing and threats.
[01:41:56.853 --> 01:41:59.995]  I mean, you'd ask a simple question, they'd begin frothing.
[01:42:00.015 --> 01:42:04.699]  And I was very calm until they'd get in my face, and I'd go, well, go ahead and take a swing then.
[01:42:04.719 --> 01:42:06.541]  I actually wasn't going to mind it.
[01:42:06.561 --> 01:42:09.123]  If one of them popped me and I had it on video, I could defend myself.
[01:42:09.614 --> 01:42:10.435]  I wish I was there.
[01:42:10.635 --> 01:42:11.275]  Oh, man.
[01:42:11.615 --> 01:42:15.278]  I mean, these people were... Listen, they would scream.
[01:42:15.298 --> 01:42:16.739]  It was horrible.
[01:42:17.119 --> 01:42:24.304]  Look, we had three cameras going for like 12 hours off and on, so I've got like 11 hours of footage.
[01:42:24.364 --> 01:42:28.667]  So it's a big hassle trying to just watch it, dump it, upload it.
[01:42:29.508 --> 01:42:33.090]  I mean, I've got two people working on it right now, which I've got to pay full time.
[01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:35.292]  They're great folks, so that's expensive.
[01:42:35.842 --> 01:42:37.864]  I've got to go over there and look at the edits.
[01:42:37.904 --> 01:42:38.345]  I want this.
[01:42:38.405 --> 01:42:38.865]  I want that.
[01:42:38.885 --> 01:42:39.946]  We've got to get it on the web.
[01:42:40.347 --> 01:42:42.049]  But, yes, we're going to get more of England up.
[01:42:42.069 --> 01:42:44.711]  We've already gotten a lot of it up for members, a lot of it for free.
[01:42:44.731 --> 01:42:47.334]  We're going to get more of this up.
[01:42:47.354 --> 01:42:48.555]  Again, why don't we have members?
[01:42:48.976 --> 01:42:50.137]  Because it's a Catch-22.
[01:42:50.538 --> 01:42:57.485]  It's so popular that if we give everything to everybody for free, which I'd like to do, I'd get a $10,000 bill and wouldn't be here.
[01:42:59.144 --> 01:43:00.785]  Well, that's why you're a national treasure, Alex.
[01:43:01.565 --> 01:43:02.866]  I'm not a national treasure.
[01:43:03.546 --> 01:43:05.527]  You say George Norrie as I think you are.
[01:43:05.607 --> 01:43:08.109]  Well, no, people like Jeff Renser are a national treasure, too.
[01:43:08.469 --> 01:43:12.411]  Anybody that will let people get on the air and tell the truth is a treasure.
[01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:13.792]  Absolutely.
[01:43:14.272 --> 01:43:15.272]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:15.332 --> 01:43:16.013]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:43:16.033 --> 01:43:18.214]  No, it's just George Norrie.
[01:43:18.254 --> 01:43:20.335]  I've had a chance to be in studio with him, engaging.
[01:43:21.756 --> 01:43:22.957]  Still waters run deep.
[01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:25.059]  George hasn't even told me this, but I can tell you.
[01:43:25.319 --> 01:43:26.720]  He's doing as much as he can.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.601]  The guy knows what's going on.
[01:43:29.022 --> 01:43:31.223]  Believe me, he's concerned.
[01:43:31.263 --> 01:43:32.484]  He's doing as much as he can.
[01:43:33.405 --> 01:43:35.666]  As much as he can get away with.
[01:43:35.707 --> 01:43:36.607]  The show's better for it.
[01:43:36.807 --> 01:43:37.528]  The ratings are up.
[01:43:38.246 --> 01:43:39.727]  That's what I tell the stations that carry us.
[01:43:39.747 --> 01:43:40.567]  We're getting more affiliates.
[01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:56.035]  I mean, it may sound crazy at first to say the government carried out 9-11, but when I got a whole bunch of government documents where they admit it publicly, and where they carried out attacks, and I got 100 news articles admitting it, and I got eyewitnesses admitting it, and I mean, the common sense shows it, and we've caught them red-handed.
[01:43:56.095 --> 01:43:58.856]  I mean, we're not radical, folks.
[01:43:59.816 --> 01:44:05.159]  I mean, I went to Crawford, and there were 200 people against the war, and seven of them, eight of them for it.
[01:44:05.822 --> 01:44:12.525]  You know, at the Crawford Ranch and five of them in town, and ABC News is saying it's equally distributed.
[01:44:13.345 --> 01:44:17.767]  And I've talked to people and watched their footage from a week ago, and I thought, well, maybe there were bigger crowds earlier.
[01:44:18.287 --> 01:44:22.149]  Two or three times a bus shows up with maybe 50 people.
[01:44:22.309 --> 01:44:26.931]  And that's the only time you could say it was anywhere near equal, and it's still not equal.
[01:44:27.331 --> 01:44:27.911]  Three to one.
[01:44:27.991 --> 01:44:32.033]  I mean, it's that type of simple deception.
[01:44:33.459 --> 01:44:38.861]  And again, obviously this Crawford thing in and of itself was a diversion from all these other bigger things that are happening.
[01:44:39.201 --> 01:44:45.523]  But by going to Crawford and using it as a case point example of just the mindlessness and the police state.
[01:44:46.423 --> 01:44:50.664]  And any time I wonder if we're really plunging into a police state, the way the Secret Service treated me.
[01:44:51.865 --> 01:44:53.205]  I mean, it was appalling.
[01:44:53.885 --> 01:44:56.966]  I politely walked up miles away from Bush.
[01:44:58.207 --> 01:44:59.627]  And what are you doing here?
[01:45:01.008 --> 01:45:01.928]  What do you want?
[01:45:03.197 --> 01:45:05.258]  And I was just like, I'm press.
[01:45:05.338 --> 01:45:07.099]  I'm here just to get shots.
[01:45:07.159 --> 01:45:09.761]  Haven't you had the media before get shots of the end of the road?
[01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:10.821]  It's interesting.
[01:45:10.961 --> 01:45:12.082]  I've got a TV show in Austin.
[01:45:13.202 --> 01:45:14.043]  Get out of here!
[01:45:14.063 --> 01:45:17.185]  And I just said, well, no.
[01:45:18.425 --> 01:45:20.306]  You've got your barricade right here.
[01:45:20.486 --> 01:45:21.687]  I'm right here talking to you.
[01:45:22.527 --> 01:45:27.930]  And all of a sudden, the state police cop, see, that guy really didn't have jurisdiction until, quote, there was some type of threat of the president.
[01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:29.511]  They obviously can't say I'm a threat because I'm not.
[01:45:29.531 --> 01:45:31.953]  I wish him long days and pleasant nights.
[01:45:31.973 --> 01:45:32.653]  He's just a puppet.
[01:45:33.328 --> 01:45:38.792]  Well, the gas mileage the globalists would get out of Bush, you know, skinning his ankle, would be unbelievable.
[01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.493]  I want Bush to be taken good care of.
[01:45:41.074 --> 01:45:45.997]  And the state police guy kind of walks over, starts getting over by me, and starts talking to me and trying to assess me.
[01:45:46.037 --> 01:45:49.880]  And I just said, it's just unbelievable.
[01:45:51.561 --> 01:45:53.343]  I mean, it's just so sad, folks.
[01:45:53.923 --> 01:45:56.085]  Secret Service didn't act like that five, ten years ago.
[01:45:57.532 --> 01:46:09.000]  I mean, I remember Free Republic being hopping mad because Free Republic people would be a mile away, held back by Secret Service from Clinton going to a hotel, and Secret Service would push them around and try to start stuff with them.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:12.182]  That was big news, and I was in support of the Free Republic guys.
[01:46:12.503 --> 01:46:13.203]  Now they're good.
[01:46:13.243 --> 01:46:15.665]  I'm glad they're arresting protesters to get within two miles.
[01:46:17.367 --> 01:46:20.730]  I'm glad Secret Service will let 500 people be pro-Bush.
[01:46:20.830 --> 01:46:25.214]  One guy with an anti-Bush sign gets arrested and, you know, six months in jail because we told you to leave.
[01:46:25.694 --> 01:46:29.257]  Fine, put me in jail because I'm standing there on the side of the road.
[01:46:29.838 --> 01:46:30.979]  And he was like a gang member.
[01:46:30.999 --> 01:46:31.419]  It was like that.
[01:46:31.639 --> 01:46:32.901]  Nothing against Northerners, folks.
[01:46:33.281 --> 01:46:37.485]  But, you know, I've got it in martial law where the cops are like, Shut your mouth!
[01:46:37.565 --> 01:46:38.886]  I'm talking here!
[01:46:39.841 --> 01:46:43.382]  You know, I'm like on the street corner interviewing somebody, and they march over and go, What are you doing?
[01:46:43.422 --> 01:46:44.642]  Turn the cameras off!
[01:46:44.862 --> 01:46:45.803]  I'll arrest you!
[01:46:46.183 --> 01:46:47.783]  Let me see your press passes!
[01:46:48.123 --> 01:46:49.864]  Like this big old Secret Service guy.
[01:46:50.664 --> 01:46:55.205]  We walk up, he's got his vest and his guns, and he's clicking a camera on his chest, taking pictures of us.
[01:46:55.785 --> 01:46:58.806]  You know, it's three clean-cut guys, and I'm, Hi, how you doing, sir?
[01:46:58.826 --> 01:47:01.887]  Uh, boy, uh, how's it going, yeah?
[01:47:03.027 --> 01:47:04.288]  What are you doing here?
[01:47:05.508 --> 01:47:06.688]  What are you doing here?
[01:47:07.809 --> 01:47:08.969]  Well, I'm just, uh,
[01:47:09.719 --> 01:47:10.499]  I've got a TV show.
[01:47:10.519 --> 01:47:13.301]  We're getting shots at the end of the road here, the ranch down there.
[01:47:13.321 --> 01:47:14.981]  We need cutaways, which we really do.
[01:47:15.161 --> 01:47:15.902]  It's interesting.
[01:47:16.702 --> 01:47:18.023]  I go, don't you ever have press out here?
[01:47:18.643 --> 01:47:19.723]  Get out of here!
[01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:23.445]  Go back to your car and get out of here!
[01:47:24.285 --> 01:47:26.086]  Well, no.
[01:47:26.286 --> 01:47:27.167]  Why?
[01:47:27.667 --> 01:47:29.227]  All of a sudden the state police start coming over.
[01:47:29.928 --> 01:47:31.808]  And he's just sitting there looking all scared of us.
[01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:35.070]  They're scared because you work for organized criminals.
[01:47:36.078 --> 01:47:41.002]  You're scared because the fear of the criminals you work for has been transferred down to you.
[01:47:43.524 --> 01:47:45.645]  And it was mafia.
[01:47:45.685 --> 01:47:48.868]  That guy could have gone and gotten a job on the Sopranos.
[01:47:48.888 --> 01:47:53.391]  And before we got there, we parked about 50 yards down because the shoulder was bigger there.
[01:47:53.411 --> 01:47:54.352]  We pulled off on the grass.
[01:47:54.672 --> 01:47:56.874]  We've been told, pull off on the grass is what the media does.
[01:47:56.894 --> 01:47:58.995]  Just don't block any of the roads.
[01:47:59.015 --> 01:48:00.677]  We pulled off on the grass shoulder there.
[01:48:00.697 --> 01:48:01.637]  It's State Highway.
[01:48:02.818 --> 01:48:04.319]  They've got a State Highway block, folks.
[01:48:04.339 --> 01:48:04.960]  You ought to see it.
[01:48:05.706 --> 01:48:11.788]  I mean, it's just, there are constant cars going through, and they've got to show their papers and be searched, because they've got homes down there.
[01:48:11.928 --> 01:48:17.770]  And we get out, and we, you know, and all of a sudden, a big old expedition, baby blue expedition with U.S.
[01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:18.730]  government comes driving by.
[01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:29.794]  And man, that guy, and we didn't get really video, we got just a second, you know, we pan, and he literally looked at us as we're walking on the grass, you know, with sunflowers beside us, and just in a very pretty, full rainbow.
[01:48:30.601 --> 01:48:35.143]  Over the Secret Service while this is happening, just gorgeous weather with these thunderstorms and the sun.
[01:48:35.183 --> 01:48:36.344]  It was just gorgeous.
[01:48:36.944 --> 01:48:38.505]  Never seen it so gorgeous as it is.
[01:48:38.525 --> 01:48:43.947]  You know, just the... I mean, the land's pretty out there, but just the day that we were out there was so pretty.
[01:48:44.367 --> 01:48:45.988]  I'm marching in a good mood up to the thing.
[01:48:46.008 --> 01:48:48.689]  You know, no fear, not putting on bad vibes.
[01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:51.330]  And this guy drives by and just looks at us.
[01:48:51.370 --> 01:48:53.011]  It just actually shows his teeth.
[01:48:53.571 --> 01:48:56.873]  A guy in sunglasses looks like, What are you doing, trash?
[01:48:57.393 --> 01:48:59.154]  What are you doing, scum?
[01:49:00.992 --> 01:49:04.054]  What in the world are those people?
[01:49:05.355 --> 01:49:11.139]  And then we get down to the, you know, the... It's just, what happened to our... And you can look down the road and see more checkpoints.
[01:49:11.159 --> 01:49:12.100]  You've got to go through several.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.121]  A mile and a half away.
[01:49:14.982 --> 01:49:16.763]  They wouldn't let the protesters get within three miles.
[01:49:17.283 --> 01:49:20.986]  But see, there's roads that split off from there and highways that split off, so they've got to let you on past.
[01:49:21.346 --> 01:49:22.827]  You can still drive down there.
[01:49:24.048 --> 01:49:25.789]  I mean, that's the end of the story, really.
[01:49:26.770 --> 01:49:27.791]  That's the end of the story.
[01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:29.712]  I guess I'll tell it in a backwards fashion.
[01:49:30.603 --> 01:49:35.864]  But, I mean, government has always been servants in this country.
[01:49:35.884 --> 01:49:40.385]  They didn't treat us like trash, just like absolute garbage.
[01:49:41.225 --> 01:49:42.926]  And you're right, it kindled a hatred.
[01:49:44.126 --> 01:49:46.887]  You know, an ancient memory of being a slave.
[01:49:47.907 --> 01:49:48.567]  I don't like it.
[01:49:48.607 --> 01:49:50.267]  I don't like it one bit, and you shouldn't either.
[01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:57.415]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.675 --> 01:49:59.257]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.597 --> 01:50:04.283]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.603 --> 01:50:09.048]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.449 --> 01:50:13.634]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.854 --> 01:50:16.675]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.775 --> 01:50:21.437]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.637 --> 01:50:26.079]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.339 --> 01:50:33.521]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:50:57.829 --> 01:51:06.656]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.976 --> 01:51:11.640]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:18.844]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.245 --> 01:51:31.032]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.492 --> 01:51:35.955]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:51:55.106 --> 01:52:01.052]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.293 --> 01:52:03.535]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.735 --> 01:52:10.082]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,

[01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:26.490]  We're good to go.
[01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.810]  I think?
[01:52:53.822 --> 01:52:59.426]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.089 --> 01:53:13.757]  Kevin Smith, who does radio reporting, co-op radio here locally, and also Radio Free Austin, he was out there yesterday with his old DAT cam recorder, doing a lot of great interviews.
[01:53:14.137 --> 01:53:15.698]  He witnessed a little bit of what we saw.
[01:53:15.718 --> 01:53:17.239]  He got there later in the afternoon.
[01:53:17.259 --> 01:53:20.722]  I'm going to give Kevin a few minutes, and then I will go to Lovebug and John and
[01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:25.494]  Daryl and David and Delilah and everybody else that's holding.
[01:53:25.954 --> 01:53:28.897]  I've got to spend 10-15 minutes sometime, though, just to tell the story.
[01:53:28.917 --> 01:53:39.227]  I mean, obviously, in the future, in the next week or so, we're going to be putting video up on the website and on the TV show of what happened, but there's no way.
[01:53:40.108 --> 01:53:46.154]  We can almost put, I guess, 10-11 hours of raw video up there, but it was just all crazy, general craziness.
[01:53:47.342 --> 01:53:49.203]  And the neocons were just so mindless.
[01:53:49.223 --> 01:53:50.544]  Then you have the left gatekeepers.
[01:53:50.584 --> 01:53:51.504]  I want to talk about them.
[01:53:53.686 --> 01:53:54.386]  Let's just do this.
[01:53:54.466 --> 01:53:56.727]  Let's just keep taking calls.
[01:53:57.528 --> 01:54:00.409]  And I think I'm going to quit taking calls at 20 after in the next hour.
[01:54:00.449 --> 01:54:03.731]  And then I'll, for a segment and a half, tell the story of what happened.
[01:54:03.751 --> 01:54:05.892]  And then I'll get to the other news.
[01:54:06.853 --> 01:54:09.834]  But Kevin Smith, who was out there yesterday.
[01:54:10.295 --> 01:54:14.277]  Kevin, how does your day go out at Crawford?
[01:54:15.347 --> 01:54:16.407]  A little shorter than yours.
[01:54:16.467 --> 01:54:20.269]  I didn't get the red baked lobster look that you got.
[01:54:20.889 --> 01:54:21.429]  Great day.
[01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:23.450]  Very cathartic experience.
[01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:31.273]  I recommend that no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you're within driving distance of Crawford, I recommend you go there.
[01:54:31.333 --> 01:54:35.355]  You need to meet with these people that have lost family members in the war.
[01:54:35.375 --> 01:54:38.256]  There's no conservative or liberal bias with them.
[01:54:38.496 --> 01:54:39.937]  They're grieving and they've lost
[01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:43.091]  A family member, and they know it was based on a lie.
[01:54:43.331 --> 01:54:47.234]  Did you ever have a chance to talk to the scum that was out there calling them names?
[01:54:48.155 --> 01:54:53.179]  Yeah, I went across the street over to their demonstration of five, I guess, and had a word with them.
[01:54:53.199 --> 01:54:54.420]  By the time you got there, it was five.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.641]  When I was first there, it was eight.
[01:54:56.482 --> 01:54:57.803]  Yeah, well, they were going back and forth.
[01:54:57.943 --> 01:55:10.233]  I mean, they were mixing in amongst the demonstrators at the Crawford Peace House also, but what you were saying earlier, and I'm reading your story, I got this same line from them, Alex, that, well, he signed on the dotted line.
[01:55:10.666 --> 01:55:11.607]  You know, he signed up.
[01:55:11.687 --> 01:55:12.628]  He had a duty.
[01:55:12.708 --> 01:55:20.273]  That's what they kept regurgitating, and I don't know where they got that talking point, but they were really... Well, that's all they ever say, although that's what they tell the troops.
[01:55:20.634 --> 01:55:23.116]  What they don't know is it actually generates more attacks.
[01:55:24.256 --> 01:55:25.497]  It's the wrong country.
[01:55:25.578 --> 01:55:27.139]  I mean, it's just made up.
[01:55:27.839 --> 01:55:37.787]  Yeah, I was in the middle of the street between some of the left and some of the right, and I read their sign, and they were like, you know, if we hadn't have done this, then we'd be speaking German and goose-stepping to Hitler, and I...
[01:55:38.368 --> 01:55:39.990]  You know, it's so much more involved.
[01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:43.873]  And meanwhile, Bush was actually, Bush's, granted he was actually funding Hitler.
[01:55:44.394 --> 01:55:44.894]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:44.934 --> 01:55:46.956]  I mean, they never get the irony of any of this.
[01:55:47.657 --> 01:55:48.798]  How about the French?
[01:55:48.838 --> 01:55:51.221]  How about you like them who don't thank us?
[01:55:51.701 --> 01:55:52.562]  We ought to thank us.
[01:55:52.602 --> 01:55:55.064]  Yeah, we ought to thank them for having a country, you idiot.
[01:55:55.605 --> 01:55:57.867]  Yeah, I mean, who's been on our side more often than not?
[01:55:57.887 --> 01:55:59.168]  It's been the French, not the British.
[01:55:59.208 --> 01:56:00.289]  We're usually fighting the British.
[01:56:00.490 --> 01:56:02.051]  You can't tell these idiots that.
[01:56:02.091 --> 01:56:02.872]  They don't know history.
[01:56:03.567 --> 01:56:04.748]  I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:56:05.048 --> 01:56:13.556]  One thing, when you were interviewing... By the way, Kevin, we should mention your dad was British, a big Lockheed employee, and you're actually a dual citizen, so it's not like you're bashing the British here.
[01:56:14.196 --> 01:56:22.663]  I'm sixth-generation Texan on my mother's side, and then blimey pond swimmer, aerospace engineer on my dad's side.
[01:56:24.525 --> 01:56:26.527]  One of the brain drain guys.
[01:56:26.547 --> 01:56:32.752]  He was a Brit that got the heck out of a system that would never let him accomplish anything more than what he was born to.
[01:56:34.254 --> 01:56:36.816]  America was a land of opportunity.
[01:56:36.836 --> 01:56:44.163]  When you were interviewing Colonel Anne Wright who was 29 years in the military and an acting ambassador in a number of embassies,
[01:56:45.515 --> 01:56:51.197]  I looked up while you were doing that and we had air tanker refuelers refueling fighters.
[01:56:51.217 --> 01:56:58.799]  I guess they used to call it mid-cap, but it was an air superiority fighter patrol over Crawford 24-7.
[01:56:59.079 --> 01:57:08.881]  If you did buy into the 9-11 nonsense, we would have been a lot better served with a 24-7 mid-cap over New York City than over Crawford.
[01:57:09.121 --> 01:57:11.182]  Just think of the dollars that are involved.
[01:57:11.222 --> 01:57:12.422]  Did you get any video of that?
[01:57:13.477 --> 01:57:14.518]  No, no, just looking up.
[01:57:14.578 --> 01:57:21.321]  It's there constantly, and I just... No, I know, but that just shows... Well, what do you think of the... Did you ever go... Stay there.
[01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:23.302]  I want to find out, because I left before you did.
[01:57:23.882 --> 01:57:24.642]  I left around dark.
[01:57:24.682 --> 01:57:26.743]  Did you ever go talk to the Secret Service?
[01:57:27.344 --> 01:57:27.804]  No, no, no.
[01:57:28.084 --> 01:57:28.944]  I'll look at you, buddy.
[01:57:29.164 --> 01:57:29.625]  All right.
[01:57:29.845 --> 01:57:31.526]  Well, I'll give you a minute more on the other side.
[01:57:31.546 --> 01:57:32.106]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.306 --> 01:57:38.189]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.881 --> 01:57:50.522]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.182 --> 01:57:52.263]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.963 --> 01:57:54.084]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.725 --> 01:57:55.545]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.286 --> 01:57:57.287]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.847 --> 01:58:01.550]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.050 --> 01:58:06.513]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:14.299]  Well, I went out to Crawford for my third visit since Lord Bush has been in office.
[01:58:15.982 --> 01:58:25.425]  And later in the shower, I will finish up some of the antics and things that happened, because they really do illustrate kind of a microcosm of our entire society.
[01:58:26.146 --> 01:58:29.587]  Kevin Smith, local radio reporter who contributes to several local stations.
[01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:36.547]  Was also there, but Kevin, before I let you go and go to other callers, I wanted to ask you, just hearing my story about the Secret Service, I mean, I have it on video.
[01:58:36.907 --> 01:58:37.587]  I'm not kidding.
[01:58:37.888 --> 01:58:40.389]  I mean, he was so hateful, so rude.
[01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:46.853]  I mean, just walking up to the camera, shooting video of the first checkpoint, miles from the ranch.
[01:58:47.114 --> 01:58:48.114]  What are you doing?
[01:58:48.234 --> 01:58:49.295]  Get out of here!
[01:58:49.315 --> 01:58:50.696]  I was just like, no!
[01:58:51.176 --> 01:58:55.539]  I mean, does that make you as mad as it makes me, just how they treat us like slaves?
[01:58:57.168 --> 01:59:01.650]  Well, it makes me mad, the black eye that Texas gets from all this, you know.
[01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:05.052]  And, you know, the gunshots at night, you know, people were talking about it.
[01:59:05.132 --> 01:59:07.873]  And, you know, the left was a little bit disturbed by it.
[01:59:07.893 --> 01:59:10.535]  And I think that's why you've got the responses of, who are you?
[01:59:10.555 --> 01:59:11.255]  Who are you with?
[01:59:11.355 --> 01:59:11.915]  From some people.
[01:59:11.935 --> 01:59:14.437]  Because they've had some investigators in there.
[01:59:14.737 --> 01:59:17.538]  But I said, you know, my answer was, hey, this is Texas, you know.
[01:59:17.558 --> 01:59:20.540]  Might be some coyotes out there trying to get his livestock, you know.
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:21.800]  It's just not that simple.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:23.621]  Yeah, but it was a whole bunch of them in the middle of the night.
[01:59:23.641 --> 01:59:24.882]  It was definitely... Oh, I know.
[01:59:25.262 --> 01:59:26.143]  Oh, you call me...
[01:59:27.176 --> 01:59:30.257]  And again, this is a key point.
[01:59:30.577 --> 01:59:39.061]  They see weirdos in cowboy hats with kids in camo outfits aiming toy machine guns at them, and the dad going, to me, you're going to have to get him, son.
[01:59:39.081 --> 01:59:40.462]  Next time, attack him.
[01:59:40.702 --> 01:59:43.303]  The kid has a machine gun aiming at a little toy machine gun.
[01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:45.344]  The libs see that and freak out.
[01:59:45.744 --> 01:59:49.025]  They don't see my father, who wouldn't let me point a toy gun at somebody if I did.
[01:59:49.065 --> 01:59:49.805]  It went in the trash.
[01:59:50.105 --> 01:59:53.407]  Who took me and taught me gun safety for two years before I could even shoot a gun.
[01:59:53.627 --> 01:59:55.428]  Who taught me how to shoot through the same hole at 200 yards.
[01:59:56.829 --> 01:59:59.712]  You know, to them, guns are like connected to this phony war.
[01:59:59.932 --> 02:00:05.938]  But when I was talking to Libs, I was able to deprogram them and get them to go out and take gun safety classes and buy guns.
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:13.006]  I mean, they just see this phony conservatism, Kevin, and Bush is a poster child for that to make us look bad.
[02:00:13.863 --> 02:00:17.144]  Exactly the same upbringing in the gun culture that you had.
[02:00:18.104 --> 02:00:21.785]  You don't dress your kids up in camo and give them toy guns and have them aim them at people.
[02:00:22.085 --> 02:00:25.046]  My dad's dad didn't let him aim toy guns.
[02:00:25.306 --> 02:00:27.287]  His daddy didn't let him aim toy guns.
[02:00:27.867 --> 02:00:31.568]  In fact, in my grandfather's time, if you aimed a toy gun at somebody, you got a whooping.
[02:00:31.948 --> 02:00:35.249]  I just would get the gun taken away and put in the trash of the toy gun.
[02:00:35.979 --> 02:00:36.840]  The same way with me.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:38.582]  I grew up in Dallas, Fort Worth, same as you did.
[02:00:38.622 --> 02:00:39.183]  I lived in the city.
[02:00:39.463 --> 02:00:41.885]  I wasn't allowed to have a pellet gun like the rest of my friends were.
[02:00:41.966 --> 02:00:46.550]  My mom was smart enough to know I'd kill animals with it or shoot a window out of the neighbors.
[02:00:46.610 --> 02:00:50.515]  Not allowed to have a pellet gun, you're just allowed to have an M1 carbine.
[02:00:51.035 --> 02:00:54.699]  Well, when I went to the country with my relatives, there was no hesitation.
[02:00:54.719 --> 02:00:56.821]  Yeah, go with your grandpa, go with your uncle, y'all go shoot.
[02:00:59.010 --> 02:00:59.430]  Exactly.
[02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:00.951]  You have respect for the gun.
[02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:04.272]  That's why when this country had to go to war, we were unstoppable.
[02:01:04.812 --> 02:01:10.814]  Now these guys, my point is, these guys shooting their mouths off about guns and their kids dressed up in these idiot suits.
[02:01:11.334 --> 02:01:14.135]  That guy's an idiot.
[02:01:14.155 --> 02:01:15.575]  I guarantee you we could out-shoot him.
[02:01:15.755 --> 02:01:16.795]  And he makes us look bad.
[02:01:16.815 --> 02:01:19.476]  I want to just say this, the last thing.
[02:01:19.856 --> 02:01:26.218]  Talking to some of those victim families, the father who lost a son in Afghanistan who was murdered for exposing...
[02:01:27.034 --> 02:01:27.434]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:01:43.092 --> 02:01:43.933]  The family.
[02:01:44.073 --> 02:01:44.993]  It's just heart-wrenching.
[02:01:45.073 --> 02:01:56.781]  Oh, yeah, for those that don't know, this young man enlisted before 9-11, goes to Iraq, was there starting his third tour, and gets shot and killed, and then the baby's coming.
[02:01:57.062 --> 02:01:59.383]  The baby's going to be born next month, and they're telling him no money.
[02:01:59.603 --> 02:02:01.264]  The GI Bill's gone, folks.
[02:02:01.705 --> 02:02:04.687]  And if you go tell neocons, they'll go, shut up!
[02:02:06.228 --> 02:02:07.449]  Well, it's just, you know, I just...
[02:02:08.339 --> 02:02:14.574]  I recommend people get out there and just put all the left-right stuff behind you and just go and approach these family members.
[02:02:14.655 --> 02:02:16.680]  You know what was amazing, Alex?
[02:02:17.381 --> 02:02:18.482]  It's the hugs, man.
[02:02:18.562 --> 02:02:20.924]  People were getting hugs out there.
[02:02:21.144 --> 02:02:23.465]  It truly was really good.
[02:02:23.546 --> 02:02:27.168]  And look, I know why Sheehan has now been picked up on by the media.
[02:02:27.588 --> 02:02:31.171]  That lady really radiates peace and love.
[02:02:31.191 --> 02:02:32.872]  She has quite a presence.
[02:02:33.333 --> 02:02:34.794]  What a pillar of strength.
[02:02:34.974 --> 02:02:36.455]  She is a pillar of strength.
[02:02:36.655 --> 02:02:36.995]  You bet.
[02:02:37.215 --> 02:02:38.356]  I mean, I experience, folks.
[02:02:38.776 --> 02:02:40.498]  You know I won't just say something that isn't true.
[02:02:41.218 --> 02:02:42.039]  It sounds corny.
[02:02:42.099 --> 02:02:43.460]  I didn't want to say it, but there, I've said it.
[02:02:46.385 --> 02:02:49.307]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.988 --> 02:02:51.289]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.489 --> 02:02:57.214]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.494 --> 02:03:02.758]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.059 --> 02:03:07.222]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.382 --> 02:03:11.145]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.425 --> 02:03:15.989]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:22.370]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:24.291]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:42.475 --> 02:03:44.555]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:47.159 --> 02:03:48.200]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.322]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.582 --> 02:03:55.744]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.164 --> 02:03:56.985]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.305 --> 02:04:01.868]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:04.490]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:19.680]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:26.785]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:46.147 --> 02:04:48.949]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:04:49.069 --> 02:04:54.131]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:04:54.371 --> 02:05:00.555]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:05:00.815 --> 02:05:06.458]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:05:06.718 --> 02:05:12.220]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:16.322]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:05:16.342 --> 02:05:21.604]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:05:21.804 --> 02:05:21.984]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:22.004 --> 02:05:22.965]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit thepowermall.com.
[02:05:28.607 --> 02:05:29.648]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:29.748 --> 02:05:31.089]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.338 --> 02:05:58.561]  Kevin Smith, who was reporting out there at Crawford yesterday, made a point that I'd forgotten to make.
[02:05:58.621 --> 02:05:59.382]  I mean, there's so many.
[02:06:01.443 --> 02:06:13.651]  There was a family out there whose son died in Afghanistan, blew his own head off at his desk one week before he was going to end eight years in the Army, very highly decorated.
[02:06:14.871 --> 02:06:20.315]  And he was... I've got it all on video, but he was like an MP...
[02:06:21.882 --> 02:06:23.523]  He had been in military police.
[02:06:23.563 --> 02:06:25.183]  He'd been reporting on drug dealing.
[02:06:25.223 --> 02:06:26.004]  He'd complained.
[02:06:26.944 --> 02:06:27.644]  Opium, folks.
[02:06:28.145 --> 02:06:29.025]  Our government dealing it.
[02:06:29.585 --> 02:06:31.306]  Supplying it to the troops there at the bases.
[02:06:31.346 --> 02:06:32.806]  And they just blew his head off.
[02:06:33.807 --> 02:06:37.168]  And they mentioned how he'd been back here on leave and gotten his wife pregnant.
[02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:39.509]  He just died a few months ago.
[02:06:39.949 --> 02:06:41.590]  The baby's about to be born.
[02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:43.191]  And they went to the VA.
[02:06:43.211 --> 02:06:44.131]  They went to the government.
[02:06:44.151 --> 02:06:46.492]  They said, hey, the GI Bill ended.
[02:06:48.118 --> 02:06:49.298]  You don't get anything.
[02:06:49.378 --> 02:07:00.741]  I think there's like a $500 benefit or something for the mother, and now they're offering some kind of $10,000 insurance bonus, but that's starting for new troops.
[02:07:00.881 --> 02:07:08.063]  See, they kind of took all the incentives away, and now they're having to add some of them back to get people in, but then they'll also renege on those.
[02:07:08.443 --> 02:07:11.804]  They're now telling people from even some World War II vets that are left.
[02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:12.644]  This is mainstream news.
[02:07:13.516 --> 02:07:21.641]  And Korean War vets, Vietnam vets, Desert Storm vets, Grenada vets, Grenada, hardly anybody got hurt there, except for Friendly Fire.
[02:07:22.581 --> 02:07:23.182]  Panama.
[02:07:24.182 --> 02:07:25.743]  Boy, that's a story in and of itself.
[02:07:26.103 --> 02:07:27.604]  They're just saying, no, no benefits.
[02:07:27.804 --> 02:07:28.264]  No nothing.
[02:07:28.324 --> 02:07:28.925]  No college.
[02:07:28.965 --> 02:07:29.425]  No nothing.
[02:07:29.445 --> 02:07:30.366]  Just shut up!
[02:07:32.827 --> 02:07:34.568]  But you go tell those neocons that.
[02:07:34.608 --> 02:07:36.789]  They'll go, shut your mouth, communists!
[02:07:36.809 --> 02:07:39.090]  You're trying to undermine our lives!
[02:07:39.991 --> 02:07:41.532]  You're funded by Soros!
[02:07:44.378 --> 02:07:48.439]  And again, they hold out a fake left to make anybody who's anti-war look bad.
[02:07:48.459 --> 02:07:53.881]  The globalists are sophisticated, folks, and they have a fake right to make conservative issues look bad.
[02:07:54.662 --> 02:07:55.802]  It's very sophisticated.
[02:07:55.822 --> 02:07:59.203]  All right, let's just rampage through your calls, because folks have been holding too long.
[02:07:59.563 --> 02:08:00.704]  Who's up next here in order?
[02:08:00.724 --> 02:08:04.645]  All right, Lovebug in Michigan.
[02:08:04.685 --> 02:08:05.626]  Lovebug, welcome.
[02:08:06.146 --> 02:08:06.926]  Welcome, Alex.
[02:08:07.006 --> 02:08:09.107]  It's an honor, really, honestly, to talk to you.
[02:08:09.707 --> 02:08:12.348]  I'd first like to say anyone who has a first-time listener...
[02:08:13.409 --> 02:08:15.251]  I want to give your, you know, sites a plug.
[02:08:15.291 --> 02:08:17.532]  They really are a wealth of knowledge and information.
[02:08:17.732 --> 02:08:26.879]  And, you know, if you really want to, you know, learn what your life is really all about, they should really check out your sites, you know, prisonplanet.com and both.
[02:08:26.959 --> 02:08:34.465]  And not be afraid to join that five, whatever it is, membership because every single one of those videos, even when I was like, no, this one doesn't sound that good.
[02:08:34.864 --> 02:08:38.825]  I would watch it, and it was more information than I've gained in years.
[02:08:38.845 --> 02:08:40.426]  So I just want to thank you for having that.
[02:08:40.466 --> 02:08:42.626]  Oh, you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:08:42.806 --> 02:08:43.446]  Absolutely.
[02:08:43.646 --> 02:08:44.747]  Well, thank you for the support.
[02:08:44.787 --> 02:08:50.688]  That makes our three webmasters work possible, and the four servers and the bandwidth.
[02:08:50.728 --> 02:08:51.209]  So thank you.
[02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:53.449]  Yeah, so I just want to thank you for having that.
[02:08:54.089 --> 02:08:58.711]  And you're constantly asking, you know, people are asking you all the time, you know, Alex, what can you do more?
[02:08:58.731 --> 02:09:00.731]  And then you say to us, well, what can we do more?
[02:09:01.371 --> 02:09:03.012]  Well, I've come up with a few of these things.
[02:09:04.127 --> 02:09:05.028]  Well, we did that two months before...
[02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:44.104]  September 11th, four years ago, coming up on four years, Operation Expose the Government Terrorist, we said, call the White House, tell them, don't attack the World Trade Center and let your agent bin Laden take the blame.
[02:09:45.245 --> 02:09:56.330]  But if more people would listen and call into talk shows and go to church and hand out flyers, we have a flyer on Infowars.com and presentplanet.com that has a lot of the facts on it, just a one-sheeter.
[02:09:57.282 --> 02:10:00.444]  And that understanding is now being accepted.
[02:10:01.284 --> 02:10:03.866]  The ground is very fertile for those truths.
[02:10:04.846 --> 02:10:12.811]  And call into C-SPAN and just have a total awakening to, wait a minute, who really stands to gain from terrorism?
[02:10:13.111 --> 02:10:19.354]  Who gets their agenda through to invade more countries, to set up a police state, to seize oil supplies?
[02:10:20.095 --> 02:10:20.695]  Absolutely.
[02:10:21.215 --> 02:10:24.297]  And another one, you've motivated me to the point of
[02:10:26.866 --> 02:10:30.109]  I can't even necessarily look at the world the same in any way.
[02:10:30.369 --> 02:10:31.149]  I mean, how can you?
[02:10:31.169 --> 02:10:36.013]  We've been asleep for so long, you know, and it's just an absolute lie that we've been living.
[02:10:36.734 --> 02:10:42.158]  And when you look at it, it's hard just to remain in it and be silent.
[02:10:42.178 --> 02:10:51.825]  So anyway, I am a teacher, but I'm giving that up this year, and I'm going to do a thing called, so last week in August, called the Seven Cities in September.
[02:10:51.845 --> 02:10:51.925]  Okay.
[02:10:52.691 --> 02:10:58.532]  And I'm going to pick seven cities that I'm going to drive my van to and have a projection TV and a video camera.
[02:10:58.972 --> 02:11:14.075]  I'm going to play your videos on walls outside different areas, wherever it is, and expose the truth and also kind of have like, almost make it a little hokey, like have a roulette wheel kind of thing, like which city do you think it's going to be?
[02:11:14.215 --> 02:11:20.796]  Because I'm so angry at the fact that here we have, you know, terror alerts of they're going to drop nuclear weapons
[02:11:21.368 --> 02:11:21.748]  We're good to go.
[02:11:21.768 --> 02:11:22.369]  We're good to go.
[02:11:40.186 --> 02:11:42.028]  When there's bombs that are going to be dropped on us.
[02:11:42.208 --> 02:11:43.769]  I mean, isn't that the same thing?
[02:11:44.309 --> 02:11:47.532]  Well, the globalists are orchestrating it and all of it.
[02:11:47.572 --> 02:11:51.254]  If they think we'll buy it, if they think we'll go along with it, they will do it.
[02:11:51.294 --> 02:11:51.895]  They're ruthless.
[02:11:51.915 --> 02:11:52.555]  They're very evil.
[02:11:53.016 --> 02:11:55.558]  But I think because of people like you, well, listen, when you do this...
[02:11:56.178 --> 02:11:57.718]  You've got to take photos of what you do.
[02:11:57.738 --> 02:11:59.259]  You ought to write an article for me about it.
[02:11:59.299 --> 02:12:00.739]  We'd love to post it on the site.
[02:12:01.239 --> 02:12:02.859]  And that's very exciting.
[02:12:02.899 --> 02:12:04.660]  And, you know, we talked about that yesterday.
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:06.520]  More Cindy Sheehan's.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.441]  Millions of us, men and women, going out, doing different, you know, activist things.
[02:12:13.041 --> 02:12:15.521]  You know, press releasing the media, the local media.
[02:12:15.962 --> 02:12:18.002]  Millions of us doing things like this.
[02:12:18.162 --> 02:12:20.202]  We will take this country back.
[02:12:20.242 --> 02:12:21.102]  And good to hear from you.
[02:12:21.402 --> 02:12:21.843]  Nice to hear.
[02:12:21.923 --> 02:12:23.203]  Thank you, and God bless you, Alex.
[02:12:23.463 --> 02:12:24.063]  God bless you.
[02:12:24.807 --> 02:12:26.508]  I don't know if you should give up teaching, though.
[02:12:26.568 --> 02:12:28.830]  It's good to have folks like you in there teaching.
[02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:31.272]  We need the good teachers to stay in there.
[02:12:31.332 --> 02:12:38.097]  But, hey, whatever path you want to follow economically or in your employment, do it.
[02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:43.100]  But it sounds like you're a good person, and I'd love to have my children taught by somebody like you.
[02:12:44.101 --> 02:12:45.642]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:12:45.722 --> 02:12:46.563]  John, you're on the air.
[02:12:46.603 --> 02:12:46.983]  Go ahead.
[02:12:47.523 --> 02:12:53.628]  Alex, that caller that you had earlier that was talking about Bush is so pro-gun and everything.
[02:12:54.484 --> 02:12:58.548]  You might have covered this story already, but it would have been interesting for him to hear it.
[02:12:59.829 --> 02:13:07.456]  There's an April 26, 2005 CNN story talking about the high court ruling on foreign convictions and gun ownership.
[02:13:10.199 --> 02:13:19.788]  Just reading a little bit from it, Clarence Thomas, Scalia, and I think it was Kennedy all voted to allow
[02:13:20.552 --> 02:13:25.336]  Convictions in any court, that would mean Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, wherever.
[02:13:25.356 --> 02:13:29.278]  Yeah, that's global government, and I remember reading that article at the time.
[02:13:29.398 --> 02:13:30.119]  Email that to me.
[02:13:30.179 --> 02:13:30.980]  I'd forgotten about that.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:31.660]  I want to post that.
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:40.246]  Yeah, internationalism, where for a hate crime, a thought crime, they convict you in Germany, then you can't own a gun here.
[02:13:40.306 --> 02:13:41.047]  That's globalism.
[02:13:41.207 --> 02:13:47.872]  Right, and it was Bush pushing it, and Thomas and Scalia, the ones that are supposed to be so conservative...
[02:13:49.548 --> 02:13:50.950]  You can't tell this guy that.
[02:13:51.171 --> 02:13:51.852]  Oh, you're right.
[02:13:52.192 --> 02:13:55.717]  I mean, I think we've hit the new height of denial.
[02:13:55.757 --> 02:14:00.644]  I guess low when someone can say that it's not Bush, it's just his father.
[02:14:01.325 --> 02:14:05.591]  Number one, I'm liberal because I think Bush is bad.
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:13.903]  Yeah, it's... I would tell these neocons out there, I'd go, well, you know, Bush gave us a $2.6 trillion budget.
[02:14:14.223 --> 02:14:14.664]  Good!
[02:14:14.704 --> 02:14:15.344]  It's for the war!
[02:14:15.404 --> 02:14:19.746]  I'd go, no, most of it's for expanding the BATF or the Department of Education.
[02:14:19.846 --> 02:14:20.426]  Liars!
[02:14:20.546 --> 02:14:22.287]  Shut the bleepin' up!
[02:14:22.767 --> 02:14:23.167]  Right.
[02:14:23.327 --> 02:14:24.828]  I want to take a swing at you!
[02:14:24.848 --> 02:14:27.789]  And I'm like, well, I just wanted to get your opinion.
[02:14:27.909 --> 02:14:28.570]  Shut it!
[02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:31.131]  Get the bleepin' out of here, boy!
[02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:32.570]  Yeah.
[02:14:32.610 --> 02:14:34.132]  Well, we're going to defend the Second Amendment.
[02:14:34.152 --> 02:14:36.414]  Yeah, you're one of those white right-wing Republicans.
[02:14:36.454 --> 02:14:38.596]  Get out of here!
[02:14:38.716 --> 02:14:40.557]  These guys are crazy.
[02:14:41.058 --> 02:14:49.265]  Also, on the caller that was calling in just now, I agree that what you want to do is commendable, but I also agree with you that teachers that are...
[02:14:49.864 --> 02:14:51.426]  They're teaching truth in their classroom.
[02:14:51.446 --> 02:14:52.627]  They're very important.
[02:14:52.667 --> 02:14:58.814]  It's like good cops are good, good FBI need to stay there if they can because it's the good people that are still holding this country together.
[02:14:58.854 --> 02:14:59.875]  Great point you said, John.
[02:15:00.796 --> 02:15:01.116]  Go ahead.
[02:15:01.336 --> 02:15:01.777]  One last thing.
[02:15:01.857 --> 02:15:02.418]  I had...
[02:15:03.286 --> 02:15:10.829]  Yeah, I want to get him on.
[02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:12.830]  I told my producer to get him on.
[02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:13.730]  It's a lady.
[02:15:14.290 --> 02:15:14.711]  A lady?
[02:15:14.731 --> 02:15:16.351]  I think there's a man doing it, too.
[02:15:16.871 --> 02:15:17.071]  Okay.
[02:15:17.091 --> 02:15:19.532]  But the point is, I've been meaning to get one of those.
[02:15:19.713 --> 02:15:22.934]  One of them's in California, one of them's in Ohio, right?
[02:15:23.314 --> 02:15:25.855]  Well, the one I'm thinking about is in Estonia, Georgia.
[02:15:26.713 --> 02:15:27.033]  Okay.
[02:15:27.093 --> 02:15:34.841]  But the interesting thing is, though, I found the eight... I don't know if you were able to download the article that I had because ABC News took it off their website.
[02:15:35.201 --> 02:15:35.542]  Interesting.
[02:15:35.562 --> 02:15:36.362]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:15:36.382 --> 02:15:38.985]  I've got to move on or I might not even be able to go to the other callers.
[02:15:39.966 --> 02:15:41.367]  But I really do appreciate your call.
[02:15:41.387 --> 02:15:45.131]  Yeah, the rates of crime and problems and misbehavior plunged.
[02:15:45.151 --> 02:15:47.193]  There's actually a bunch of schools doing that.
[02:15:48.254 --> 02:15:50.096]  Let's go to David.
[02:15:51.033 --> 02:15:51.694]  Or Daniel.
[02:15:51.874 --> 02:15:53.095]  Daniel, where are you calling us from?
[02:15:53.215 --> 02:15:55.577]  I'm calling from Hartford, but I've called you before from Houston, Alex.
[02:15:55.597 --> 02:16:03.163]  I was the kid who wrote the Facebook article, so it was interesting to see Facebook is expanding to 2,000 schools now, but that's actually not what I was calling about.
[02:16:03.944 --> 02:16:13.612]  One quick thing I want to mention, I don't think you've put on your website that they're reorganizing the National Guard now so that the Pentagon and the federal government can now order the National Guard deployed in certain states.
[02:16:14.068 --> 02:16:15.669]  Even if the governors refuse to do so.
[02:16:15.689 --> 02:16:18.551]  Yeah, I've been covering that for ten years.
[02:16:18.751 --> 02:16:24.935]  Okay, now what... You're talking about the Washington Post last Monday, the 40-page plan that Bob Barr decried.
[02:16:24.975 --> 02:16:26.836]  I read the article every day last week.
[02:16:27.156 --> 02:16:27.677]  Okay.
[02:16:27.777 --> 02:16:30.679]  And where troops will be on the streets running our lives.
[02:16:31.379 --> 02:16:33.600]  And then Chertoff came out and said, don't worry about it.
[02:16:33.721 --> 02:16:35.662]  Well, I'm looking forward to my stay in the FEMA camp.
[02:16:35.962 --> 02:16:39.064]  But I wanted to... On the left gatekeeper thing, I actually... I was calling to talk about...
[02:16:39.344 --> 02:16:39.744]  Horrible creature.
[02:16:39.764 --> 02:16:42.105]  Here's Noam Chomsky on the 2004 vote fraud.
[02:16:42.125 --> 02:16:42.405]  He says...
[02:17:01.621 --> 02:17:03.584]  I don't find any compelling evidence.
[02:17:03.604 --> 02:17:06.449]  An inaccurate count is in itself a random effect.
[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:09.775]  As for collusion, yes, there are concerns, but concerns are not evidence.
[02:17:10.703 --> 02:17:12.244]  On the CIA, this is what he says.
[02:17:12.664 --> 02:17:15.885]  Or take the CIA, which is considered a source of a lot of these conspiracies.
[02:17:16.145 --> 02:17:20.186]  We have a ton of information, and the CIA is basically just an obedient branch of the White House.
[02:17:20.506 --> 02:17:26.368]  It's the same with the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and all these other crazy conspiracies people are racing around.
[02:17:26.528 --> 02:17:27.828]  They're nothing organizations.
[02:17:28.128 --> 02:17:28.908]  Of course they're there.
[02:17:29.208 --> 02:17:31.649]  Obviously rich people get together and talk and play golf.
[02:17:31.929 --> 02:17:32.689]  But it's not a plan.
[02:17:32.749 --> 02:17:33.810]  It's not a big surprise.
[02:17:35.177 --> 02:17:36.800]  Yeah, it's in your face, world government.
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:38.623]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:17:38.763 --> 02:17:39.805]  I've got to get to the story.
[02:17:39.865 --> 02:17:40.887]  I've got to get to the news.
[02:17:41.668 --> 02:17:42.649]  These calls are so good.
[02:17:42.710 --> 02:17:43.170]  Stay there.
[02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:43.992]  I'll let you finish up.
[02:17:46.315 --> 02:17:49.378]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[02:17:49.599 --> 02:17:55.244]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:17:55.545 --> 02:18:01.411]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:18:01.531 --> 02:18:07.497]  Also known as a miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:18:07.817 --> 02:18:11.502]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[02:18:11.682 --> 02:18:16.507]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[02:18:16.648 --> 02:18:21.653]  With several delicious varieties including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[02:18:21.833 --> 02:18:24.216]  You can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[02:18:24.456 --> 02:18:27.340]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.426]  And to meet the demands of a busy day the natural and healthy way, try Gano Café today.

[02:18:48.132 --> 02:18:52.634]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:52.974 --> 02:18:57.056]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:57.356 --> 02:18:57.896]  We listened.
[02:18:58.216 --> 02:19:03.198]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:03.458 --> 02:19:03.939]  We listened.
[02:19:04.339 --> 02:19:07.380]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:08.340]  We listened.
[02:19:08.801 --> 02:19:12.142]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:19:12.202 --> 02:19:12.762]  We're good to go.
[02:19:38.058 --> 02:19:39.620]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:41.262]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:46.718 --> 02:19:52.943]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:53.384 --> 02:20:01.170]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:09.357]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:09.677 --> 02:20:14.438]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:20:14.758 --> 02:20:19.480]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:23.821]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:20:24.341 --> 02:20:25.342]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:25.422 --> 02:20:29.503]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:20:34.824 --> 02:20:37.325]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:20:37.625 --> 02:20:38.126]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.081 --> 02:20:49.443]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:20:49.703 --> 02:20:50.023]  Why?
[02:20:50.043 --> 02:20:52.984]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:20:53.064 --> 02:20:58.007]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:20:58.147 --> 02:21:07.851]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[02:21:59.685 --> 02:22:03.486]  Look, all I can say about Noam Chomsky is this.
[02:22:03.526 --> 02:22:09.668]  He's got a lot of high school kids and college students who go, Do you read Chomsky?
[02:22:09.688 --> 02:22:12.488]  Oh, it's so hard to grasp it.
[02:22:12.548 --> 02:22:13.609]  Oh, yes, I do.
[02:22:14.529 --> 02:22:17.690]  Oh, it's, you know, they don't even know anything about politics.
[02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:20.190]  They just go, Do you know Chomsky?
[02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:27.132]  And it's just like a byword for, Do you know the genius of Earth, the MIT pimp?
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:32.561]  And, I mean, yeah, he talks about manufacturing consent and media manipulation.
[02:22:32.601 --> 02:22:33.902]  Well, everybody talks about that.
[02:22:35.542 --> 02:22:37.283]  And, I mean, I've had him on as a guest.
[02:22:37.363 --> 02:22:41.644]  And it's just, world government's going to save us from the evil American corporations.
[02:22:41.664 --> 02:22:44.826]  And I'm like, but the American corporations openly fund world government.
[02:22:44.906 --> 02:22:45.666]  Oh, no, they don't.
[02:22:46.046 --> 02:22:47.066]  That's just ridiculous.
[02:22:47.566 --> 02:22:50.928]  And he says there's no evidence of government involvement in 9-11 or even prior knowledge.
[02:22:50.948 --> 02:22:51.628]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:22:52.428 --> 02:22:53.689]  And then he gives no facts for that.
[02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:56.550]  Oh, and yeah, no evidence of election fraud in 2000 or 2004.
[02:22:59.529 --> 02:23:01.470]  Again, I'm not for the Democrats.
[02:23:01.810 --> 02:23:05.533]  If you're going to have a staged election, you've got to have those people laid down, too.
[02:23:06.553 --> 02:23:07.774]  Kerry's laid down.
[02:23:07.954 --> 02:23:08.654]  It's staged.
[02:23:08.694 --> 02:23:12.817]  The point is, do I have to go into that?
[02:23:13.457 --> 02:23:16.959]  I mean, just evidence upon evidence upon evidence upon evidence.
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:21.842]  I mean, yeah, I've read... You know what, Daniel?
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.542]  Listen, let me stop you.
[02:23:24.842 --> 02:23:28.947]  It's pointless to... I mean, you're welcome to talk about this on air, but I've got to move on and I've got to tell stories.
[02:23:28.987 --> 02:23:29.688]  Take two more calls.
[02:23:29.708 --> 02:23:30.389]  That's all I'm taking.
[02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:32.272]  You sound like a smart person.
[02:23:32.292 --> 02:23:36.017]  Why don't you take this quote, decipher it, write me a big article...
[02:23:36.869 --> 02:23:38.090]  Sound like an intelligent fella.
[02:23:38.610 --> 02:23:45.413]  Email it to tipsandinfowars.com or over to Paul Watson at Prison Planet over there, and we'll post it and 10 million people will read your story.
[02:23:45.733 --> 02:23:50.075]  Why don't you do a 20-page paper on Noam Chomsky, the whore of the New World Order?
[02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:52.216]  Okay, now you've got 45 seconds left.
[02:23:52.256 --> 02:23:52.516]  Go ahead.
[02:23:52.936 --> 02:23:56.420]  Alex, I want to say, Noam Chomsky is somebody who will say there's propaganda.
[02:23:56.761 --> 02:23:57.722]  Here's what he won't talk about.
[02:23:57.742 --> 02:24:02.387]  Yeah, he'll tell you there's propaganda, but then never address any of the real propaganda.
[02:24:02.547 --> 02:24:03.368]  I have letters with him.
[02:24:03.388 --> 02:24:03.989]  I just want to talk.
[02:24:04.029 --> 02:24:05.671]  I'll use my 30 seconds as best I can.
[02:24:05.711 --> 02:24:06.552]  I am writing an article.
[02:24:06.572 --> 02:24:07.473]  That's what I wanted to tell you.
[02:24:07.533 --> 02:24:09.035]  I've also written that Facebook one before.
[02:24:09.315 --> 02:24:13.179]  Noam Chomsky, I've got 14 letters between myself and the professor.
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:13.500]  He says...
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:22.530]  Bilderberg doesn't exist, doesn't talk about MKUltra, Federal Reserve, CIA drug dealing, the Echelon Network, the HAARP system, Chemtrails, any of the real hardcore issues.
[02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:23.872]  The CFR doesn't exist.
[02:24:24.192 --> 02:24:28.437]  On Operation Northwoods, he says, Operation Northwoods, I'm more skeptical about...
[02:24:28.677 --> 02:24:29.857]  I'm skeptical about anything.
[02:24:30.017 --> 02:24:31.938]  It doesn't even come close, and it was not carried out.
[02:24:32.238 --> 02:24:36.199]  Furthermore, it shows that nothing in history even remotely resembles what was proposed on 9-11.
[02:24:36.259 --> 02:24:40.421]  I mean, that is the document where they say, we're going to switch the airplanes, we're going to crash them into buildings.
[02:24:40.441 --> 02:24:42.441]  She says, it doesn't even resemble 9-11.
[02:24:42.761 --> 02:24:46.163]  I say, Alex, you need to spend more time exposing the left gatekeepers.
[02:24:46.263 --> 02:24:47.363]  Many people in your audience...
[02:24:47.683 --> 02:24:49.024]  Understand that Bush is corrupt.
[02:24:49.044 --> 02:24:50.525]  They understand that the Republicans are corrupt.
[02:24:50.745 --> 02:24:52.106]  Many of these liberals are running around.
[02:24:52.126 --> 02:24:53.246]  They're pushing gun control.
[02:24:53.266 --> 02:24:58.389]  They're pushing this environmental garbage from the World Wildlife Fund and the European... Well, hey, end of story.
[02:24:58.510 --> 02:25:01.791]  Please do not tell... Look, I'm working so hard it's insane.
[02:25:02.412 --> 02:25:04.213]  And by the way, I'm going to be taking a vacation soon.
[02:25:04.593 --> 02:25:06.674]  You need to do it.
[02:25:06.774 --> 02:25:07.495]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:07.615 --> 02:25:08.435]  I want the article.
[02:25:08.475 --> 02:25:09.596]  I want it in in two days.
[02:25:10.937 --> 02:25:12.658]  But you've all got assignments.
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:15.201]  Listen, we've got the audience.
[02:25:15.661 --> 02:25:17.141]  I can't write articles on all of it.
[02:25:17.161 --> 02:25:23.644]  I had 20 minutes this morning and wrote a half-you-know-what attempt at an article about Crawford.
[02:25:24.444 --> 02:25:25.745]  Just covering news and taking calls.
[02:25:25.785 --> 02:25:27.746]  I'm running out of time just verbally talking about it.
[02:25:28.446 --> 02:25:29.407]  Just all of it.
[02:25:29.667 --> 02:25:33.228]  You've got something good that isn't a bunch of... I mean, if the article isn't up to snuff, I won't post it.
[02:25:34.209 --> 02:25:35.909]  Or I'll post it as an email, as a comment.
[02:25:36.169 --> 02:25:37.570]  It's good I'll post it as an article.
[02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:39.031]  Send them to me!
[02:25:40.151 --> 02:25:41.612]  Delilah in Ohio.
[02:25:41.652 --> 02:25:42.092]  Go ahead.
[02:25:43.051 --> 02:25:44.352]  Thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:25:44.392 --> 02:25:45.353]  I really appreciate it.
[02:25:45.373 --> 02:25:46.293]  Thank you for calling.
[02:25:46.333 --> 02:25:47.174]  No, stop thanking me.
[02:25:47.194 --> 02:25:48.014]  Go ahead.
[02:25:48.254 --> 02:25:53.177]  I wanted to share an interesting conversation that I had with a friend of mine out there in upstate New York.
[02:25:53.978 --> 02:26:00.902]  We were talking about the topic of the borders being wide open, and he mentioned something to me that was pretty interesting.
[02:26:01.522 --> 02:26:10.107]  He mentioned that about three weeks ago, he was driving by in Brewster, New York, and he had mentioned to me how he had seen
[02:26:11.099 --> 02:26:15.767]  Um, out of like 150 people or something like that, it was like maybe
[02:26:17.548 --> 02:26:28.233]  98 to 99% of all those people, just crowds and crowds of people, and he noticed that they were all pretty much Mexicans or probably illegal immigrants.
[02:26:28.273 --> 02:26:30.594]  Well, yeah, there's 30 million illegals here now.
[02:26:30.634 --> 02:26:33.155]  They're going to double that in the next 15 years or more.
[02:26:34.335 --> 02:26:38.857]  It's all run by the government to drive down wages and hurt all Americans.
[02:26:38.957 --> 02:26:40.678]  That's exactly what we were talking about.
[02:26:40.698 --> 02:26:41.578]  I was mentioning that...
[02:26:44.139 --> 02:26:51.082]  Yeah, you're going to have troops watching you and a transponder on your license plate and all of this, but the illegal aliens are God.
[02:26:51.682 --> 02:27:07.049]  Now, how do you make somebody understand, because he, when I was getting into this topic and I was talking a little bit about, you know, your program and that kind of stuff, and where I'm getting all this information from, because obviously it's not on CNN or anything like that, and he asked me,
[02:27:08.182 --> 02:27:11.105]  Well, he said, well, maybe you should be a politician or something like that.
[02:27:11.205 --> 02:27:15.188]  And I tried to get him to understand that it's too late to work within the system.
[02:27:15.288 --> 02:27:19.491]  How do you explain to somebody why it's too late to work within the system?
[02:27:19.511 --> 02:27:21.293]  It's a good question, Delilah.
[02:27:22.374 --> 02:27:23.595]  Will you take the answer off there?
[02:27:23.975 --> 02:27:24.215]  Yeah.
[02:27:24.415 --> 02:27:25.456]  I'll try to answer it when we get back.
[02:27:25.516 --> 02:27:26.577]  And then talk to Mark briefly.
[02:27:26.677 --> 02:27:30.140]  I've got to tell the story of Crawford and then hit a few news items.
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:31.141]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.161 --> 02:27:31.561]  Stay with us.

[02:27:37.589 --> 02:27:39.211]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.111 --> 02:27:42.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.958 --> 02:27:54.823]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:27:55.084 --> 02:27:57.425]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:27:57.686 --> 02:27:59.647]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:27:59.988 --> 02:28:05.352]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:28:05.732 --> 02:28:10.017]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.

[02:28:18.547 --> 02:28:23.593]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:28:23.633 --> 02:28:25.656]  military and numerous other government agencies.

[02:29:48.416 --> 02:29:52.240]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:53.381]  Read the labels.
[02:29:53.822 --> 02:29:57.946]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:58.166 --> 02:30:02.370]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:30:02.731 --> 02:30:07.616]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[02:31:05.172 --> 02:31:16.114]  Number one, tell your friend who's not waking up that human history is a long crane of people struggling against oppressors, against slavery.
[02:31:16.714 --> 02:31:28.496]  And that history and who he is and where he comes from, regardless of what color he is, is nothing but an endless trail of examples of this.
[02:31:29.857 --> 02:31:31.057]  And that that's where he comes from.
[02:31:32.122 --> 02:31:34.603]  And again, regardless of his background, he comes from that.
[02:31:34.643 --> 02:31:35.463]  We all come from that.
[02:31:36.043 --> 02:31:38.024]  Black, white, purple, green, it doesn't matter.
[02:31:40.944 --> 02:31:42.265]  They divide and conquer.
[02:31:42.285 --> 02:31:43.405]  They manipulate us.
[02:31:46.426 --> 02:31:49.987]  And at the same time, if the person doesn't get it and is laughing at you, move on.
[02:31:51.327 --> 02:31:52.427]  You're doing them a favor.
[02:31:52.447 --> 02:31:53.668]  You've got to have an attitude like this.
[02:31:54.208 --> 02:31:57.949]  An attitude really means it's what you believe, not what you're trying to believe.
[02:31:58.561 --> 02:32:00.662]  You've got to have the attitude of, I'm doing you a favor.
[02:32:00.782 --> 02:32:01.602]  I'm in command.
[02:32:02.402 --> 02:32:03.502]  I'm on the stick.
[02:32:04.042 --> 02:32:05.243]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:32:05.843 --> 02:32:07.203]  You're in danger, buddy.
[02:32:07.283 --> 02:32:08.524]  You have been fooled.
[02:32:09.044 --> 02:32:11.984]  Now let me give you the inside scoop, because I care about you.
[02:32:13.165 --> 02:32:14.345]  Tyranny is upon us.
[02:32:14.405 --> 02:32:15.505]  We're losing our freedoms.
[02:32:18.306 --> 02:32:20.087]  And, you know, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[02:32:20.147 --> 02:32:21.447]  The New World Order wasn't built in a day.
[02:32:21.467 --> 02:32:22.767]  We're not going to tear it down in a day.
[02:32:24.348 --> 02:32:25.688]  This isn't going to happen overnight.
[02:32:26.914 --> 02:32:28.715]  We're not going to defeat this evil overnight.
[02:32:28.756 --> 02:32:29.816]  It's an attitude, though.
[02:32:32.719 --> 02:32:33.459]  It's an attitude.
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:36.822]  And so just stop putting up with the enslavement.
[02:32:37.382 --> 02:32:38.603]  Stop putting up with the tyranny.
[02:32:38.623 --> 02:32:39.944]  Tell him he better get involved.
[02:32:39.964 --> 02:32:40.925]  He better get informed.
[02:32:41.225 --> 02:32:42.306]  Bad things are happening.
[02:32:44.748 --> 02:32:46.470]  Let's go ahead and take one final call.
[02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:48.071]  Mark in Louisiana, go ahead.
[02:32:48.837 --> 02:32:49.117]  Hello?
[02:32:49.498 --> 02:32:49.738]  Hi.
[02:32:50.258 --> 02:32:50.719]  Las Vegas.
[02:32:51.219 --> 02:32:51.940]  I keep doing that.
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:54.022]  It says LA, and I just think, oh, that's Louisiana.
[02:32:54.042 --> 02:32:55.043]  Okay, Las Vegas.
[02:32:55.584 --> 02:32:58.066]  I was in the Marine Corps on active duty for four years.
[02:32:58.086 --> 02:33:00.849]  I was a 3rd Battalion Marine Regiment Infantry Unit.
[02:33:01.489 --> 02:33:04.893]  I'm a disabled veteran, 40%, rated by the VA.
[02:33:05.874 --> 02:33:09.317]  And you're so right when you talk about how benefits have been taken away.
[02:33:09.337 --> 02:33:12.360]  They actually use the fact that we're disabled veterans
[02:33:13.338 --> 02:33:18.003]  As an excuse to not give us our GI Bills, and that's exactly... But you're with Al-Qaeda!
[02:33:18.343 --> 02:33:19.804]  If you say it, yeah.
[02:33:19.824 --> 02:33:29.213]  I mean, you had this so down... You're trying to explain this to a neocon, and they're like, you must be some liberal there, complaining about Bush and this government.
[02:33:29.834 --> 02:33:30.515]  What do you think you're doing?
[02:33:30.955 --> 02:33:35.519]  And I'll tell you another thing that... This is a good talking point against the war.
[02:33:35.619 --> 02:33:36.080]  I noticed...
[02:33:37.510 --> 02:34:04.653]  All these big fraudulent so-called veterans organizations like the DAV and the VFW and the American Legion, they help conflate this idea that you're supporting the troops and the veterans by supporting the war policy, and these politicians, and mix the two together, they come out supporting the war, and then a couple days later, you read one of their publications, and they'd be complaining that veterans are so underserved, and I've never for the life of me understood how somebody who realizes that veterans are underserved
[02:34:05.220 --> 02:34:11.204]  And aren't taken care of properly can turn around and say, support making more disabled veterans.
[02:34:12.244 --> 02:34:12.865]  No, I hear you.
[02:34:12.885 --> 02:34:13.905]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[02:34:14.005 --> 02:34:21.790]  Listen, we have a government that promised the World War I fighters we lost, what, 400,000 troops or something insane?
[02:34:23.771 --> 02:34:24.672]  Some insane number.
[02:34:24.712 --> 02:34:25.292]  It's near that.
[02:34:26.833 --> 02:34:29.315]  And they promised them, oh, you're getting a big bonus when you get back.
[02:34:29.375 --> 02:34:29.855]  It was like $500, $400.
[02:34:32.378 --> 02:34:33.859]  And, man, they all camped out.
[02:34:33.879 --> 02:34:35.780]  A couple thousand of them demanding their bonus.
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.382]  They just rode them down, machine-gunned them, killed a whole bunch of them.
[02:34:38.502 --> 02:34:40.103]  I think that's how you support.
[02:34:40.263 --> 02:34:41.264]  Well, that's right.
[02:34:41.304 --> 02:34:42.785]  They're a bunch of traitors.
[02:34:44.426 --> 02:34:49.930]  Or you sit there and, look, no, supporting the troops means sticking a Chinese plastic American flag on your car.
[02:34:52.832 --> 02:34:55.494]  You know, so many of these gung-ho types, when their kid dies...
[02:34:56.818 --> 02:34:58.539]  They get that letter home right before they die.
[02:34:58.579 --> 02:34:59.880]  It's all lies over here.
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:01.200]  We're fed rotten food.
[02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:04.722]  Then they finally get the letter back, and their son's dead.
[02:35:04.782 --> 02:35:08.484]  A lot of them finally wake up, but some of them aren't going to wake up.
[02:35:08.504 --> 02:35:10.264]  I mean, it's a worship of government.
[02:35:10.304 --> 02:35:12.285]  It's worshiping George Bush.
[02:35:12.566 --> 02:35:14.587]  It's bootlicking is what it's called.
[02:35:15.847 --> 02:35:17.488]  And again, Bush is just a figurehead.
[02:35:17.908 --> 02:35:20.169]  They're just licking the boots of a figurehead, a statue.
[02:35:20.189 --> 02:35:21.070]  Might as well be a statue.
[02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:23.691]  A smirking statue with pointed ears.
[02:35:25.862 --> 02:35:26.603]  And that's all it is.
[02:35:26.643 --> 02:35:29.165]  I mean, Democrats worship Bill Clinton in the same pathetic fashion.
[02:35:30.786 --> 02:35:31.947]  We've got to get past that.
[02:35:33.688 --> 02:35:39.472]  But, you know, they tested chemical and biological weapons on our troops.
[02:35:39.613 --> 02:35:40.213]  In mass.
[02:35:41.814 --> 02:35:42.435]  In mass.
[02:35:44.897 --> 02:35:46.178]  Over and over again, they admit it.
[02:35:46.218 --> 02:35:47.639]  You mentioned that to people in Crawford.
[02:35:47.659 --> 02:35:48.499]  They'll just scream.
[02:35:48.519 --> 02:35:51.862]  You know, the 7, 8, 9 people out protesting for Bush.
[02:35:53.044 --> 02:35:54.845]  What about chemical and biological testing?
[02:35:55.005 --> 02:35:57.586]  You've got to do tests or the enemy's going to kill us!
[02:36:00.828 --> 02:36:05.251]  Yeah, but the Army documents show they knew it was going to hurt the troops dropping an A-bomb a mile and a half from them.
[02:36:05.311 --> 02:36:08.132]  Well, just... I ain't talking to you!
[02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:08.973]  Shut up!
[02:36:10.453 --> 02:36:13.355]  Son, you may have to kill people like that someday.
[02:36:14.727 --> 02:36:20.970]  I mean, just to see them willfully losing their minds, losing the control of their own destiny.
[02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:23.671]  All right, let me just get to this story now.
[02:36:25.992 --> 02:36:29.454]  And I didn't plug my videos last hour, and I may not plug them this hour in the interest of time.
[02:36:29.494 --> 02:36:31.615]  Just go to Infowars.com and get them.
[02:36:31.735 --> 02:36:32.355]  They're excellent.
[02:36:32.676 --> 02:36:33.596]  They wake folks up.
[02:36:33.696 --> 02:36:40.339]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv and you'll get all the reports from Crawford, the video reports, reports from England, all my films.
[02:36:40.799 --> 02:36:42.060]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:43.901]  I'll try to plug in the last minute of the show.
[02:36:44.904 --> 02:36:45.944]  If I'm able to, I will.
[02:36:46.325 --> 02:36:51.307]  All right, everybody keeps saying, go to Crawford, go to Crawford, go to Crawford, go to Crawford.
[02:36:52.027 --> 02:36:55.068]  And I'm covering Crawford, having a few guests on the last few weeks about it.
[02:36:55.128 --> 02:36:58.310]  And my wife says, you need to go to Crawford.
[02:36:58.810 --> 02:37:01.731]  And I know a diversion story when I see one.
[02:37:02.151 --> 02:37:13.776]  Not that it isn't important what Cindy Sheehan's doing, and not that the other mothers and fathers out there are dead vets aren't important, but overall, a million other serious things are going on, and this is being turned into a big spectacle.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:21.745]  But I am down the road, and there's always a story behind the story, and that could become an illustration of some of the propaganda we're facing.
[02:37:25.167 --> 02:37:27.848]  So I got in the car yesterday morning at 8 a.m.
[02:37:27.888 --> 02:37:29.709]  and drove an hour and a half up there.
[02:37:32.111 --> 02:37:33.792]  And so let's just tell the story of the day.
[02:37:36.434 --> 02:37:40.836]  In McGregor, I get pulled over by a police officer for going 60 in a 40.
[02:37:41.957 --> 02:37:43.438]  And boy, it's set up for speeding.
[02:37:44.105 --> 02:37:44.666]  Checkpoints.
[02:37:44.746 --> 02:37:45.827]  I mean, it's set up for that.
[02:37:46.387 --> 02:37:52.813]  It's 60, then it's 70, then it's 40, then it's 50, then it's... I'm in the space of 200 yards, but I get the ticket.
[02:37:53.413 --> 02:37:55.755]  He walks over, okay, I deserve it, give me the ticket.
[02:37:55.775 --> 02:38:01.860]  He goes, you're Alex Jones, I listen to you on the radio back in KJFK days, and I listen to you on George Norring.
[02:38:03.061 --> 02:38:04.503]  And I'm still giving you a ticket.
[02:38:04.583 --> 02:38:10.648]  And I go, oh, because the Secret Service comes through here, I don't give them a ticket because I don't want to end up dead.
[02:38:12.314 --> 02:38:13.475]  Oh, you know about the New World Order?
[02:38:13.595 --> 02:38:13.936]  Uh-huh.
[02:38:14.596 --> 02:38:15.597]  I still gave you a ticket.
[02:38:15.637 --> 02:38:18.220]  So he was a fan, still gave me a ticket.
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.023]  But I'll tell you, I've had a lot of other police that let me off.
[02:38:22.503 --> 02:38:23.884]  I've had a ticket about two or three years.
[02:38:24.645 --> 02:38:26.507]  See, I bragged about it, so it happened.
[02:38:26.807 --> 02:38:28.769]  He probably heard me brag about it.
[02:38:29.089 --> 02:38:33.093]  Every cop that pulls me over, I've run into who's been a fan and lets me go.
[02:38:33.533 --> 02:38:34.954]  I was speeding, I got the ticket.
[02:38:35.415 --> 02:38:36.215]  A hefty one, too.
[02:38:38.297 --> 02:38:39.058]  Ian McGregor.
[02:38:41.013 --> 02:38:42.094]  But okay, I had to tell that.
[02:38:42.174 --> 02:38:44.395]  Boring, who cares, but I spent 45 seconds on it.
[02:38:45.355 --> 02:38:48.137]  So I get on into Crawford, and I come to the four-way stop.
[02:38:48.157 --> 02:38:51.418]  They're about to turn and drive 10 more miles out to the ranch.
[02:38:53.599 --> 02:38:57.381]  And there is this giant store that says Bush Gifts.
[02:38:57.441 --> 02:39:01.163]  And the whole store is stuff about worshipping George Bush, and how he's a fighter pilot.
[02:39:01.644 --> 02:39:04.125]  There's giant Ten Commandments, and we thank Bush.
[02:39:05.106 --> 02:39:11.869]  Real M16s and Heckler & Koch submachine guns welded into this giant Liberty Bell.
[02:39:14.370 --> 02:39:22.493]  And weirdo, yuppie bikers literally chanting and Cindy Sheehan scumbag.
[02:39:24.034 --> 02:39:28.976]  And I'm interviewing them in weirdos and cowboy hats with little kids in camo.
[02:39:29.836 --> 02:39:34.478]  And I go, well, I see these big Ten Commandments here.
[02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:47.098]  But Bush actually supported the Alabama Attorney General that went after Judge Roy Moore and then promoted him to a federal judgeship.
[02:39:48.019 --> 02:39:49.860]  I don't care about the Ten Commandments!
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.141]  You know, at first, I'm a Christian.
[02:39:51.201 --> 02:39:51.841]  I love George Bush.
[02:39:51.861 --> 02:39:54.763]  You know, I said that bleepin' bleep F.S.
[02:39:54.883 --> 02:39:55.264]  bleep.
[02:39:55.804 --> 02:39:58.606]  You know, I don't give a bleep about the Ten Commandments.
[02:39:58.686 --> 02:40:00.067]  Kill them Arabs!
[02:40:00.874 --> 02:40:07.962]  And I mean, these are people like driving $50,000, $60,000 bikes, brand new giant pickup trucks, Rolex watches.
[02:40:07.982 --> 02:40:09.604]  These are nouveau riche, folks.
[02:40:10.525 --> 02:40:11.766]  They're scum, man.
[02:40:11.806 --> 02:40:14.049]  I mean, just shameful trash.
[02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:16.852]  And some of them are a little nicer.
[02:40:17.012 --> 02:40:18.333]  I won't say what I think of that.
[02:40:20.456 --> 02:40:20.716]  Bleep.
[02:40:21.813 --> 02:40:24.394]  Yes, he's being used by a bunch of commies.
[02:40:24.954 --> 02:40:34.257]  Well, Bush wants to get rid of the borders, and Bush's Supreme Court ruling, take our private property, and a lot of liberals have actually dissented.
[02:40:34.838 --> 02:40:38.639]  Well, whatever, you've got to build, you've got to do what you've got to do.
[02:40:38.939 --> 02:40:41.140]  We've got to get them for where they get us.
[02:40:42.060 --> 02:40:45.161]  Yeah, but the CIA says Iran isn't a threat for ten years.
[02:40:45.241 --> 02:40:47.502]  I mean, our own government's helping arm North Korea.
[02:40:48.431 --> 02:40:48.971]  Shut up!
[02:40:48.991 --> 02:40:49.792]  Are you with him?
[02:40:49.932 --> 02:40:51.913]  I tell you, you ought to take a swing at you.
[02:40:51.993 --> 02:40:56.435]  No, no, the CIA says we don't need to... I support the president, boy!
[02:40:59.156 --> 02:41:02.018]  And suddenly, these guys' eyes would go crazed.
[02:41:02.178 --> 02:41:03.579]  It was like a bunch of Charlie Mansons.
[02:41:03.599 --> 02:41:05.139]  It was like a demonic spirit.
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:09.121]  I described that at gun grabber conferences.
[02:41:09.141 --> 02:41:11.122]  It was the only other time I've seen it with a million bombs.
[02:41:11.602 --> 02:41:14.584]  They were even more Charlie Mansons.
[02:41:15.370 --> 02:41:19.572]  It was more of a sneaky, slithering monkey likeness to the Million Moms.
[02:41:19.612 --> 02:41:31.718]  This was like a... Some of these were good-looking families, you know, six-foot-four guys that looked like John Wayne with cowboy hats and little, you know, handsome kids and good-looking wives, but acting like demonic pig monsters.
[02:41:32.638 --> 02:41:37.801]  And then, you know, just big, dirty-looking bikers with big old beards going, shut up, scum.
[02:41:37.901 --> 02:41:39.802]  I said, well, you're going to take a swing?
[02:41:39.842 --> 02:41:40.142]  Take it.
[02:41:41.129 --> 02:41:42.150]  Man, I'd love to.
[02:41:42.170 --> 02:41:43.730]  I'd have had it all on camera.
[02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:45.652]  Boy, I'd have just instantly launched into those people.
[02:41:45.672 --> 02:41:50.794]  They'd have found out that the power of light is a lot of power in the dark side they're tuned into.
[02:41:52.015 --> 02:41:53.316]  But I'm ashamed.
[02:41:53.336 --> 02:41:53.956]  That's how I felt.
[02:41:53.996 --> 02:41:54.576]  That's how I did.
[02:41:54.596 --> 02:41:55.877]  I had a bunch of scum around me.
[02:41:56.377 --> 02:42:01.700]  I'd just switch into this cornered animal thing, but it actually feels good when a bunch of scum gets around me.
[02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:02.601]  Yeah, boy.
[02:42:02.801 --> 02:42:03.141]  Yeah.
[02:42:03.361 --> 02:42:04.402]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:05.022 --> 02:42:06.403]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:06.463 --> 02:42:07.203]  You're trash.
[02:42:07.223 --> 02:42:08.404]  You're sick scum.
[02:42:08.764 --> 02:42:09.965]  And I would sit there.
[02:42:12.023 --> 02:42:13.944]  And I'd go, what about the troops not giving them treatment?
[02:42:14.064 --> 02:42:14.805]  That's a lie!
[02:42:14.845 --> 02:42:19.047]  Just get out of here, you deaf and bleeping scumbag!
[02:42:20.088 --> 02:42:23.830]  Well, you know, Bush is... Alberto Gonzalez is for the Second Amendment.
[02:42:24.430 --> 02:42:26.251]  I don't care about the Second Amendment!
[02:42:26.331 --> 02:42:27.552]  I love Bush!
[02:42:31.193 --> 02:42:32.294]  Folks, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:42:32.314 --> 02:42:33.555]  Most of this can't even be put on the web.
[02:42:34.728 --> 02:42:36.769]  I mean, it'll take hours just to bleep it all out.
[02:42:37.289 --> 02:42:41.270]  Then you have other groups of real quiet Christian types, but they're like not even Christian.
[02:42:41.290 --> 02:42:44.691]  They're like totally, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[02:42:44.711 --> 02:42:49.192]  All these people are saying all this, and I'm going, and I go, what about Skull and Bones?
[02:42:49.212 --> 02:42:50.632]  What about, you're of the devil.
[02:42:51.613 --> 02:42:52.353]  Get away from me.
[02:42:52.393 --> 02:42:53.373]  He's of the devil.
[02:42:53.453 --> 02:42:55.514]  I mean, literally.
[02:42:55.894 --> 02:42:56.534]  No, no, no.
[02:42:56.594 --> 02:42:58.254]  Bush, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[02:42:58.514 --> 02:42:59.455]  I've heard this before.
[02:42:59.495 --> 02:42:59.975]  You're of them.
[02:43:00.015 --> 02:43:00.495]  You're of them.
[02:43:00.535 --> 02:43:00.995]  You're of them.
[02:43:03.126 --> 02:43:04.847]  I mean, they were cult members, folks.
[02:43:04.987 --> 02:43:05.807]  Cult members.
[02:43:06.688 --> 02:43:20.815]  And out of, I don't know, the five, six, seven people in town, if you have two or three here, two or three there, then there were like eight maximum out there protesting against the hundreds of peace people, who were mainly former conservatives, who are real conservatives now.
[02:43:21.756 --> 02:43:22.996]  We're covering neocons.
[02:43:25.538 --> 02:43:26.718]  They're really nice, good people.
[02:43:26.778 --> 02:43:29.060]  Predominantly, there was some scumbag gatekeeper left.
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:29.840]  Really annoying.
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:31.441]  Very akin to the other scum.
[02:43:32.839 --> 02:43:43.437]  But there was one person out with the pro-New World Order Bush people, pro-Bush people out at Crawford Ranch.
[02:43:44.699 --> 02:43:47.020]  There was one guy who had a red beard.
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:48.060]  He was nice.
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:50.081]  He said, look, Alex, I know who you are.
[02:43:50.101 --> 02:43:55.003]  I agree with a lot of what you say, but I don't believe Bush is behind 9-11 like you do.
[02:43:55.123 --> 02:43:56.903]  He would actually talk, so I interviewed him for a while.
[02:43:56.943 --> 02:43:59.284]  I said, I believe we hired him to do a job.
[02:43:59.304 --> 02:44:00.665]  We're in a war, and it's tough.
[02:44:01.305 --> 02:44:04.006]  We've got to win this thing before they come get us over here.
[02:44:04.986 --> 02:44:09.388]  I hear a lot of what you're saying, Alex, but I just, you know, we've got to stick with the leader.
[02:44:11.268 --> 02:44:13.589]  At least he wasn't a crazed maniac.
[02:44:14.497 --> 02:44:16.499]  I mean, folks, and believe me, I wasn't crazed.
[02:44:16.539 --> 02:44:17.700]  I mean, I've gotten a lot calmer.
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:18.721]  I get crazed on the radio.
[02:44:20.243 --> 02:44:22.185]  I was out there calmly interviewing people.
[02:44:22.865 --> 02:44:35.878]  And, I mean, if you disagreed with them or you brought up any salient point that disagreed with them in any way, I mean, you know, I'd walk over and go, so what's going on with, you know, why are you here?
[02:44:36.647 --> 02:44:43.413]  Let me just tell you, scumbag, you ought to get right back over there, you bleeper, before I just unloose on you.
[02:44:43.773 --> 02:44:45.555]  Before I open up a can.
[02:44:45.575 --> 02:44:50.899]  You're like, well, uh... I saw you hug her.
[02:44:50.919 --> 02:44:56.544]  Because you let you see me hug Cindy Sheen, and she was so nice, and then you hug, oh, Alex, thanks for coming.
[02:44:57.265 --> 02:45:01.629]  I saw you... Think about all the guys going.
[02:45:01.649 --> 02:45:02.629]  Other guy, you see him, son?
[02:45:02.689 --> 02:45:03.430]  You see him, son?
[02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:04.231]  You see him, son?
[02:45:05.438 --> 02:45:07.379]  Next time he says, use that weapon on me.
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:10.281]  Little kid's got a little plastic .847 aiming it at me.
[02:45:10.321 --> 02:45:13.303]  I mean, they were like turned into animals, folks.
[02:45:13.363 --> 02:45:18.226]  Turned into gibbering, demonic smoke coming out of their ears.
[02:45:20.647 --> 02:45:23.008]  Folks, I could almost see the demons in them.
[02:45:23.048 --> 02:45:24.389]  I mean, it was literally spiritual.
[02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:29.172]  I mean, they were just so evil, and they didn't even know it.
[02:45:29.512 --> 02:45:30.713]  That's the ultimate slave.
[02:45:30.933 --> 02:45:31.453]  Christ said it.
[02:45:31.473 --> 02:45:34.495]  They're not as blind as those that have eyes and can't see.
[02:45:35.365 --> 02:45:40.167]  I mean, the servants of the New World Order, most of them are just these gibbering, emotional... And you know what?
[02:45:40.187 --> 02:45:44.790]  I've been to football games, and I've seen... The last time I went to a UT football game was about ten years ago.
[02:45:44.810 --> 02:45:50.232]  I mean, the crowds were getting vicious and angry, and women were grinding their teeth.
[02:45:50.292 --> 02:45:51.733]  I mean, just do it!
[02:45:52.414 --> 02:45:57.316]  Now, I talked to Paul Watson, who still goes to soccer games, football games, and he says, you know, he gets into it.
[02:45:57.356 --> 02:45:58.537]  And I'm like, stop doing it, man.
[02:45:58.577 --> 02:45:59.177]  It's dangerous.
[02:45:59.895 --> 02:46:01.336]  It's like mass mind control.
[02:46:01.636 --> 02:46:19.086]  They take your normal animal instincts of resisting tyranny and misdirect them into like weird little facsimiles and they shunt them into these weird little... And with the left gatekeepers, I mean, we were constantly... Here I am raising money for the Peace House, a few guys we've had on, and I need to use the bathroom or something, and they go, Who are you?
[02:46:19.266 --> 02:46:20.286]  Are you with the conservative group?
[02:46:20.326 --> 02:46:22.968]  Are you with the... You know, we don't look quite hippie-fied.
[02:46:23.582 --> 02:46:25.524]  And, well, you really can't use the bathroom here.
[02:46:25.984 --> 02:46:34.010]  You know, but it was always, most of the people were real nice, but they were always like these self-appointed people who Cindy would actually have to shoo away from us.
[02:46:34.690 --> 02:46:35.631]  You know, now leave them alone.
[02:46:35.671 --> 02:46:36.332]  They're nice.
[02:46:37.132 --> 02:46:40.375]  And they were really annoying, the classic dumbbell, bleeding-heart liberal.
[02:46:40.555 --> 02:46:41.175]  You're Alex Jones.
[02:46:41.215 --> 02:46:41.816]  I've heard of you.
[02:46:43.498 --> 02:46:44.179]  I've been warned.
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:53.287]  But most of them were like old hippie women and rich old ladies, the classic types that come to stuff, and just good Christian conservative families that were out there against the war.
[02:46:54.849 --> 02:46:59.853]  But there were that handful of types.
[02:47:01.035 --> 02:47:03.477]  But listen, the liberals from all over the country knew who I was.
[02:47:04.427 --> 02:47:06.889]  95% of them were positive, waking up.
[02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:09.591]  You know, you changed my mind about the Second Amendment.
[02:47:09.611 --> 02:47:10.632]  It really makes sense now.
[02:47:11.013 --> 02:47:13.455]  For a tyrannical government, I never really saw it.
[02:47:13.915 --> 02:47:15.196]  And now I see it.
[02:47:15.596 --> 02:47:20.160]  I go, yeah, you see that scum over there with their kid pointing a fake machine gun at you?
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:21.942]  You think it's about mindless violence?
[02:47:22.022 --> 02:47:23.443]  No, it's about resisting that.
[02:47:24.043 --> 02:47:24.864]  Yes, I see.
[02:47:24.924 --> 02:47:25.444]  You're right.
[02:47:25.464 --> 02:47:28.287]  And I see now that big government's for the corporations.
[02:47:28.367 --> 02:47:30.408]  And that big government isn't going to help us.
[02:47:30.448 --> 02:47:30.949]  And we've got to...
[02:47:31.542 --> 02:47:32.363]  You know, I see.
[02:47:32.443 --> 02:47:33.584]  You really changed me.
[02:47:33.644 --> 02:47:38.828]  You know, you really, just hundreds, I mean, I say hundreds, dozens and dozens came up and said that out of the hundreds.
[02:47:40.430 --> 02:47:49.137]  And it was really heartening and encouraging, but we were constantly being nipped at by self-appointed minions.
[02:47:51.119 --> 02:47:56.564]  We were always being nipped at by, you know, because I wasn't wearing the uniform.
[02:47:57.699 --> 02:48:02.220]  You know, the uniform of the others were cowboy hats and Marine Corps shirts and Army shirts.
[02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:06.081]  And, you know, the uniform of the other was earrings.
[02:48:06.141 --> 02:48:09.002]  And, you know, that was to check us out.
[02:48:11.722 --> 02:48:13.963]  It didn't help that some of our group, you know, had shirts on.
[02:48:13.983 --> 02:48:15.763]  Pro-Second Amendment shirts.
[02:48:16.444 --> 02:48:22.105]  And, of course, there had been gunshots in their direction the night before, so... They were a little skittish, but...
[02:48:24.091 --> 02:48:27.413]  And of course, if a Democrat was in office, the liberals would be almost just frothing.
[02:48:27.453 --> 02:48:32.416]  I mean, I've had them squirt water on my camera years ago and hit me with signs and call the cops on me.
[02:48:32.456 --> 02:48:35.437]  But we're definitely deprogramming the left.
[02:48:35.497 --> 02:48:40.780]  If we just get out of this false system, we'll be right back with some final tidbits about the Crawford trip.
[02:48:47.162 --> 02:48:50.025]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.265 --> 02:48:51.866]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.187 --> 02:48:56.891]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.211 --> 02:49:01.655]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:02.055 --> 02:49:06.239]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.459 --> 02:49:06.939]  We're good to go.

[02:50:03.114 --> 02:50:03.434]  I think.

[02:51:52.575 --> 02:51:54.977]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:52:01.601 --> 02:52:09.526]  But imagine the left, who's starting to wake up, starting to figure out the government's bad, government's big, government's controlled by corporations.
[02:52:09.826 --> 02:52:13.088]  When they're starting to figure it out, they're starting to shift paradigms.
[02:52:13.148 --> 02:52:18.452]  But imagine them seeing the cretins, the creatures, the under-the-rock dwellers,
[02:52:20.714 --> 02:52:21.654]  And I don't mean how they looked.
[02:52:21.694 --> 02:52:26.278]  I mean their mentalities that were there just literally frothing in hatred at them.
[02:52:26.998 --> 02:52:33.303]  There really was a spirit of lovingness and goodness and everything over there with the hippies.
[02:52:33.763 --> 02:52:35.384]  I mean, they mean well, folks.
[02:52:35.404 --> 02:52:36.385]  They're just misguided.
[02:52:36.425 --> 02:52:43.950]  But actually, if you come at it with a common sense approach and you're not some frothing neocon, you can actually deprogram them.
[02:52:45.131 --> 02:52:46.972]  And that's how we're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:52:47.012 --> 02:52:48.153]  We are not going to do it
[02:52:49.507 --> 02:52:51.868]  By worshiping George Bush, I assure you.
[02:52:53.689 --> 02:52:58.131]  The whole time I was there, I was saying, you know, when Democrats get in office, were you against the Serbian war?
[02:52:58.511 --> 02:52:59.832]  Yes, I was, but not enough.
[02:52:59.932 --> 02:53:01.113]  Yes, the Democrats are evil.
[02:53:02.033 --> 02:53:16.740]  We're causing that shift, but just the end of the day, to go down right at sunset and to pull up, you know, it's major, you know, little Texas highways there, farm roads,
[02:53:17.634 --> 02:53:20.015]  And just to have the Secret Service, get out of here!
[02:53:20.055 --> 02:53:21.436]  What are you doing here?
[02:53:22.057 --> 02:53:23.137]  Well, we're oppressed.
[02:53:23.498 --> 02:53:24.458]  Just get out of here.
[02:53:24.518 --> 02:53:25.038]  Well, no.
[02:53:25.239 --> 02:53:26.659]  It was all just color of law.
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:28.480]  Just get out of here.
[02:53:29.141 --> 02:53:30.602]  And the guys that are taking pictures of us.
[02:53:30.922 --> 02:53:31.963]  Because we're all evil.
[02:53:32.003 --> 02:53:32.903]  We're all criminals.
[02:53:32.943 --> 02:53:33.684]  We're all bad.
[02:53:34.224 --> 02:53:35.765]  Basically, we're all Al-Qaeda.
[02:53:38.306 --> 02:53:40.548]  And that's miles from where Bush is even at.
[02:53:40.588 --> 02:53:41.148]  I mean, it just...
[02:53:42.267 --> 02:53:48.030]  Because, you know, when I was in London, we took photos and shot video, and we'd see police with machine guns, and, hi, can we talk to you?
[02:53:48.110 --> 02:53:49.030]  Sure, bloke.
[02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:52.331]  We'd come over and stand behind them and say, hey, those were nice officers.
[02:53:52.752 --> 02:53:56.933]  It seemed like the special forces type cops were nice, because I guess they're not wimps.
[02:53:56.953 --> 02:54:02.176]  It was all little petty assistant cops who were like, we'll arrest you, turn your cameras off, and are walking down the street.
[02:54:02.476 --> 02:54:04.437]  So if you're bad, we'll show you as bad.
[02:54:04.457 --> 02:54:06.057]  If you're good, we'll show you as good.
[02:54:06.097 --> 02:54:07.238]  We want to find good.
[02:54:08.590 --> 02:54:09.110]  We want to.
[02:54:09.150 --> 02:54:12.053]  Believe me, every day I try to go, oh, things aren't this bad, oh, things aren't that.
