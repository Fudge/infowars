[00:00:04.198 --> 00:00:08.361]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:09.822]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:11.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:15.847]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:36.720]  Coming up later in the hour, we're scheduled to have two New Hampshire state representatives on who have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 6 that has the strongest wording of any of the 20-plus bills we've seen.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.523]  Some passing states, some on their way to passage if you put pressure on them.
[00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:48.629]  Establishing martial law or a state of emergency within one of the states comprising the United States of America without the consent of the legislature of the state.
[00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.372]  They're saying the state is going to secede if this happens.
[00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:56.395]  Requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service for the people.
[00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:57.255]  Article 2.
[00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:58.296]  Slavery.
[00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:00.317]  Article 3.
[00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:03.419]  Requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service for persons under the age of 18.
[00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:05.661]  That's in the President's new public plan.
[00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:06.501]  Article 4.
[00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:11.004]  Surrendering any power delegated or not delegated to any corporation or foreign government.
[00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:16.267]  That's these criminal treaties signing authority over even private corporations, not just governments or multinational groups.
[00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:21.271]  Any act regarding legislation or religion, further limitations on freedom of speech,
[00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.073]  Political speech or further limitations on freedom of the press, which is federal systems pushing for.
[00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:48.804]  Article 6, further infringes on the right to keep and bear arms, including prohibitions on the type and quantity of arms and ammunition, and that should any such act of Congress become law or executive order or judicial order be put into force, all powers previously delegated to the United States of America by the Constitution of the United States shall revert to the several states' individuals.
[00:01:51.647 --> 00:02:04.195]  Any further government of the United States of America shall require ratification of three-quarters of the states seeking to form a government of the United States and shall not be binding upon any state not seeking to form any such government.
[00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:11.739]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen, and this is secession.
[00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.602]  And there's now 20 plus
[00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.595]  States with similar legislation introduced are passing.
[00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:27.559]  Now understand, people are like, how dare them try to overthrow the federal government.
[00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.824]  The federal government is constituted by the states and by the people, Tenth Amendment.
[00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:33.706]  We constitute it.
[00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:38.852]  The federal government's been hijacked decades and decades and decades and decades ago by offshore banks.
[00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.014]  Now they're not intent to have trillions in fiat currency and own hundreds of palaces and jets and incredible power and companies.
[00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:56.398]  They want to micromanage our lives and run every facet of our lives and disarm us and social engineer us and have remote control systems controlling our TVs, computers, thermostats.
[00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:57.779]  It's all announced.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.600]  Shutting down farms and ranches.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.662]  I mean, you can't make up something this bad.
[00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.131]  Now technology is allowing us to get around their controlled media, but it's also the double-edged sword they're using against the people.
[00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.237]  And that's what's happening right now.
[00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.682]  It's happening in a big way.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.143]  So I beg and I plead for everybody out there to look at the evidence, to look at the information.
[00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:29.525]  You know, we covered this article and I've researched it.
[00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:31.326]  I've researched what's going on around the country.
[00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:39.271]  It's an accurate story from a daily newscaster in FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago.
[00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:42.133]  And it gets into the mass graves, the martial law, all of it.
[00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:44.515]  They're moving.
[00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.677]  The Feds are federalizing everything right now.
[00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:55.626]  Obama just grabbed the census away from any congressional overview and is going to use it as a way to make Americans report on themselves and tell the government everything they're doing constantly.
[00:03:56.086 --> 00:04:00.951]  They're seizing the National Security Council's taking over all the federal agencies saying Congress has no oversight.
[00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:06.857]  PDD 51 that states the President is absolute ruler that Bush signed that Obama's continuing.
[00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.701]  Notice he's not reversing any of those executive orders.
[00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:15.109]  He'll say he's not going to hire lobbyists, and frankly, I've never seen an administration with this many lobbyists in it.
[00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.416]  He's saying he's going to end the war, and he increases the troops massively, and now says, oh, 23 months, we'll look at pulling out.
[00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:20.997]  Maybe.
[00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:27.549]  It's gone from six months to 16 months to 23 months in a month.
[00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:30.530]  So I guess in a year it'll be 20 years till they leave.
[00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.870]  I mean, not two years.
[00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:33.831]  That's what's going on.
[00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:35.231]  That's what's happening.
[00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:40.093]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv in very dark hours for the Republic.
[00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:46.376]  It's a corporate takeover of the United States, the state governments, the local governments, your bank accounts.
[00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:54.254]  They have got you in debt so they can implode it and have a fire sale and then own everything and then you'll be dependent on them.
[00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:55.534]  That's the plan.
[00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:56.875]  Total domestication.
[00:04:57.295 --> 00:04:58.915]  Total institutionalization.
[00:04:59.216 --> 00:04:59.696]  Feudalism.
[00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.136]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:03.577]  eFoods does it again.

[00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:13.220]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.

[00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:35.818]  The 3 Day Responder
[00:05:36.343 --> 00:05:39.825]  Is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:42.347]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:46.929]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.991]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.

[00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:01.276]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:05.020]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.022]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:10.386]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:11.427]  It is essential that...
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.521]  We're good.
[00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:35.745]  Directly to your computer or iPhone, and shared with others.
[00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:41.951]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:46.635]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:49.457]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:06:49.798 --> 00:06:51.479]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.641]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:55.623]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:06:55.963 --> 00:06:57.384]  Bring down the new world order.
[00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:58.505]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.043 --> 00:07:03.425]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:08.768]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:13.730]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:25.216]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:31.179]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:37.483]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.766]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.127 --> 00:08:07.410]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:20.448]  Thank you.
[00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:22.349]  We are back live.
[00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:28.134]  We have Representative Ingbertson joining us in about 25 minutes.
[00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:36.481]  We have Representative Dan Itza joining us here in just a few minutes from New Hampshire.
[00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:41.826]  It's always fun dragging these men and women off the floor when they're in session or busy.
[00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:53.735]  Before we go to the next guest, I just want to encourage the listeners to understand that Barack Obama is nothing but a front man and a puppet of the New World Order.
[00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:54.876]  And I know you know that.
[00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:57.438]  I know you know he's lied about everything he said he would do.
[00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:58.359]  We knew that was going to happen.
[00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.680]  Look at who bought and paid for him.
[00:09:01.052 --> 00:09:03.273]  We have to get past his cult of personality.
[00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:10.157]  Remember, Bush was a cult of personality at a 92%, 93% approval rating after they staged 9-11, but that dissipated quickly.
[00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:15.440]  Because they need that messianic front leader to carry their agenda through to fool the public.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:22.525]  I mean, he'll sit there and go up to old ladies and go, I'm stopping all the lobbyists, I'm stopping all the corruption, I promise you, I pledge.
[00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:24.566]  And then he's
[00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:28.317]  We were trying to do voiceovers last night with all the lobbyists.
[00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:29.097]  We had to stop.
[00:09:29.337 --> 00:09:29.917]  There's hundreds.
[00:09:29.977 --> 00:09:37.000]  I mean, they filled the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, right down to the twentieth post at every major department.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.161]  Department of Defense, Department of Education, Health and Human Services.
[00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.602]  That's only one facet of the film.
[00:09:42.262 --> 00:09:43.422]  It's like ten minutes of the film.
[00:09:43.903 --> 00:09:45.323]  It's just his lies on lobbyists.
[00:09:45.363 --> 00:09:47.524]  I mean, I'm probably going to have to cut it down.
[00:09:49.264 --> 00:09:58.332]  The lies about the war, the lies about wiretapping, the lies about torture, the lies about... Because he'll say, I signed an executive order stopping it all, and you read the executive order, it does, and it continues it.
[00:10:01.495 --> 00:10:12.305]  But then there's the really scary stuff, the gun confiscation, the FEMA camps, the youth brigades, the socialism, I mean, it's all covered in the Obama deception, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:24.009]  Right now you can order it on the secure online Yahoo shopping cart and then your order goes in the stack, there's a stack in there, and it, from the first order to the last, it goes in that order, shipped out.
[00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:29.630]  We'll pretty sure have the video in probably a week, maybe even earlier, before the release date.
[00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:36.071]  So, you might have a little surprise and it might come before then, but that's doubtful.
[00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:38.732]  The point is, they'll first come, first served.
[00:10:39.787 --> 00:10:45.330]  We're going to have these suckers pre-packed, ready to ship March 15th to you, the Obama Deception.
[00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.452]  It is so important to get these out to everyone.
[00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:52.634]  It is so important that this go absolutely viral.
[00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:54.215]  I want you to buy DVD burners.
[00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:57.457]  I want you to buy copies of DVDs, you know, blank ones.
[00:10:57.497 --> 00:11:01.920]  If you've got to sell all the junk in the garage to do it, you don't need that crap anyways, the old jet ski rotting.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.162]  And just have a duplication place to make a thousand copies.
[00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:08.778]  I don't want to say I don't care.
[00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:09.919]  I want you to make copies.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.402]  I want this sucker to go to the four wins and it'll be up on PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:18.444]  You can burn it to disk or to DVD.
[00:11:18.984 --> 00:11:20.264]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.365]  Get your membership there now.
[00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:32.271]  Fifteen cents a day, $5.95 a month and this goes back into our war chest to expand the fight and hire more people and get more done here in the fight against the globalist.
[00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.318]  So it's so important to pre-order the Obama Deception today.
[00:11:36.338 --> 00:11:43.519]  And don't wait, we've got all these other films we're carrying, like Eye of the Phoenix, Part 3 of America's Secret Beginnings.
[00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:46.560]  Just an amazing film, available at Infowars.com.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.041]  Endgame, Terror Storm, all of them.
[00:11:52.661 --> 00:11:54.842]  We're joined by Representative Dan Itza.
[00:11:56.272 --> 00:12:06.702]  Who is one of the sponsors, in fact his name is listed as first on the bill so I guess he must have been the one that introduced it and wrote it, the state of New Hampshire
[00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:17.173]  And it is House Concurrent Resolution 6, and it's the strongest and the best we've seen, saying they have right to revolt under their Article 10 of New Hampshire, live free or die.
[00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:20.934]  They will pull out of the union if this basically continues and happens.
[00:12:20.954 --> 00:12:22.615]  That's the way I read the last page.
[00:12:23.135 --> 00:12:27.816]  If gun confiscation happens, if martial law happens, if they try to have youth brigades, which has all been announced.
[00:12:28.277 --> 00:12:31.878]  So, Representative Itza, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:34.739]  Well, I'm very proud to.
[00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:40.348]  I want to make sure that I'm perfectly clear about one thing.
[00:12:41.349 --> 00:12:44.691]  The objective of this resolution is not secession.
[00:12:45.612 --> 00:12:53.877]  The objective, the happiest resolution of this resolution, would be a revitalized union within the confines of the Constitution.
[00:12:54.918 --> 00:13:05.605]  That said, if the general government should choose to aggress in a manner that nullifies the Constitution, it is impossible to secede from something that doesn't exist.
[00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:19.367]  And the preceding language, which does talk about essentially nullification of the Constitution, is not my language.
[00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:20.928]  Those are Thomas Jefferson's words.
[00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:23.109]  Well, I understand.
[00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:28.431]  When the government becomes destructive of the aims of the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, it is null and void.
[00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:31.012]  It is not just a right, it is a duty to
[00:13:33.243 --> 00:13:35.953]  Break it up and reform it, so please sir.
[00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.011]  What made you write this legislation?
[00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:42.313]  What made you put Thomas Jefferson's words in there?
[00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:44.234]  I thought I recognized them.
[00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:51.939]  And now this is really igniting a bushfire across the country, because we are seeing not just a federal takeover.
[00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:58.623]  Time Magazine, in an article titled The New World Order last week, said a foreign global bank will control the U.S.
[00:13:58.643 --> 00:14:01.104]  government and everything we do in the United States.
[00:14:01.124 --> 00:14:05.507]  So we're trying to head off an offshore banking takeover of the United States.
[00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:08.510]  Absolutely, and many other things.
[00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:11.732]  What inspired me?
[00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:15.954]  Well, I mean, this isn't something new on my agenda.
[00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:22.237]  I submitted a resolution calling for the repeal of the odious portions of the Patriot Act in, I think, 2003.
[00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:33.503]  I submitted a resolution last year, which was last term, declaring that anything like the North American Union would be unconstitutional.
[00:14:34.892 --> 00:14:52.662]  But then this summer, when I was studying for my role as James Madison in the National Heritage Center for Constitutional Studies skit that we do every year, I came across the Kentucky Resolution.
[00:14:53.222 --> 00:14:59.526]  And they are just such a perfect, perfect statement of all the principles involved.
[00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:03.828]  I knew that I had to take them and incorporate them into a resolution.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.322]  And then give that resolution some objectives.
[00:15:08.822 --> 00:15:12.284]  Are you talking about the Kentucky Resolution from 96 against the U.N.
[00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:13.584]  takeover of national parks?
[00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:16.165]  No, I'm talking about the Kentucky Resolution of 1798.
[00:15:16.345 --> 00:15:18.046]  Yes, okay.
[00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:24.169]  Against the Alien and Sedition Act, which were the 18th century version of the Patriot Act.
[00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:26.470]  Yes, okay.
[00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.952]  Okay, so this goes right back to the foundations of our government.
[00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:34.993]  Jefferson wrote it and submitted it to Kentucky.
[00:15:35.053 --> 00:15:43.959]  He had James Madison submit it to Virginia, which Madison wouldn't have done if he didn't endorse the principles enumerated.
[00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:55.265]  So you've got the gentleman who drafted the Declaration of Independence and the gentleman who drafted the Constitution for the United States of America and its first ten amendments.
[00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:57.687]  These are their principles.
[00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:01.109]  These are how they saw the relationship between the states and the general government.
[00:16:01.724 --> 00:16:05.046]  The general government is not the final judge of the Constitution.
[00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:07.827]  The states are, representing the people.
[00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:25.455]  Sir, and that's because the central government can be taken over by outside or corrupt forces within, and so the states are obviously... Well, it's because the states are the parties to the compact, and to allow the general government
[00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:36.469]  To be the exclusive or final judge of its delegated powers and those it might delegate to itself is to make its discretion and not the Constitution the measure of its power.
[00:16:41.147 --> 00:16:55.298]  Let's go through the illegal activities, the unconstitutional activities of the federal government that is exploding right now, and then what your piece of legislation, H.C.R.
[00:16:55.318 --> 00:17:01.342]  6, is stating, and the ultimatum that the state is laying out here.
[00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:02.924]  Okay.
[00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:09.929]  I don't have it open before me, so you probably do, and you can correct me if I misstate.
[00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:27.319]  But the first one deals with the making of martial law or a state of emergency in any, not just ours, but any of the states, because that certainly violates the guarantee of a Republican form of government.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.561]  You have to have the consent of that state's legislature to do so, expressing the will of the people.
[00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:35.401]  The second one is
[00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:40.625]  Uh, involuntary servitude other than a draft during a time of war.
[00:17:40.665 --> 00:17:46.670]  And in fact, there are good constitutional arguments against a draft because it would deprive the states of their militia.
[00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:59.480]  Um, but involuntary, uh, uh, servitude other than as a consequence of due process law and, uh, an alternative to incarceration.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.304]  Uh, any involuntary servitude of a, of someone under the age of 18.
[00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:33.060]  Any further infringements on freedom of the press, speech, religion, or any infringement on religion, any expansion of prohibitions on the types of firearms or quantity or types of ammunition that might be owned, aka AHR-45, all of these things violate
[00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:41.930]  The fundamental maxims that are enumerated in our Constitution, both in the Bill of Rights and in the main body itself.
[00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.770]  And they are treason, are they not?
[00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.751]  This is treason!
[00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:46.251]  Absolutely.
[00:18:46.271 --> 00:19:02.835]  If you're in a divorce, and you're in a marriage that is rocking and cruising for divorce, you don't just show up one day, or it's not right to just show up one day and hand divorce papers.
[00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:04.232]  I don't know.
[00:19:23.137 --> 00:19:23.998]  For some time now.
[00:19:24.058 --> 00:19:24.638]  But you know what?
[00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:26.459]  We're not going to tolerate it anymore.
[00:19:26.479 --> 00:19:28.600]  And if you do it again, you will have crossed the line.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.862]  If you're dealing with a bully, you don't draw the line behind the bully.
[00:19:32.202 --> 00:19:34.544]  You draw the line between yourself and the bully.
[00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:38.726]  So, that's what this is.
[00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:40.247]  This is the line in the sand.
[00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:41.428]  Representatives, stay there.
[00:19:41.448 --> 00:19:43.709]  I want you to repeat that when we come back as we're going into break.
[00:19:44.129 --> 00:19:45.230]  Finish up with your comments.
[00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.292]  And I've had other state reps on.
[00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.873]  I want to see if you're aware.
[00:19:49.913 --> 00:19:50.473]  I'm sure you are.
[00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:51.454]  You sound very informed.
[00:19:52.904 --> 00:19:57.011]  About PDD 51 and other things because they're definitely making their move.
[00:20:00.014 --> 00:20:03.916]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:16.404]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:17.245]  The U.S.
[00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:22.868]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:25.470]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:28.392]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:28.412 --> 00:20:31.273]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:31.394 --> 00:20:37.317]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:20:37.833 --> 00:20:41.177]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:20:41.257 --> 00:20:47.684]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:20:48.184 --> 00:20:52.209]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:52.569]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:52.809]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:59.844 --> 00:21:06.108]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:06.468 --> 00:21:08.469]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.150]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:11.191]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:12.372]  This is his M.O.
[00:21:12.392 --> 00:21:13.813]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:13.853 --> 00:21:15.494]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:22.578]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:22.978 --> 00:21:23.418]  Some U.S.
[00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:29.102]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:29.802 --> 00:21:33.284]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:33.304 --> 00:21:36.106]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.831]  Your engine is the heart of your vehicle.
[00:22:03.151 --> 00:22:06.291]  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to determine whether it's going to go the long run?
[00:22:06.472 --> 00:22:09.552]  Or should you dump your vehicle before you experience a major expense?
[00:22:09.792 --> 00:22:13.954]  The military has developed such a technology, and it's called Oil Analysis.
[00:22:14.234 --> 00:22:22.456]  By taking a mere 4-ounce sample during an oil change, you can get an easy-to-read, complete report by an independent laboratory covering engine wear,
[00:22:22.836 --> 00:22:24.617]  Oil Condition and Contamination
[00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:53.156]  We're good.
[00:23:13.332 --> 00:23:15.614]  Nature's Gem Premium Omega-3.
[00:23:15.774 --> 00:23:27.002]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.
[00:23:27.162 --> 00:23:35.688]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight, keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of Omega-3.
[00:23:35.868 --> 00:23:39.010]  The result is a delicious nutty, buttery flavor.

[00:23:52.956 --> 00:23:53.396]  Or call 800-387-5516.
[00:23:53.476 --> 00:23:53.656]  That's 800-387-5516.
[00:23:53.676 --> 00:23:54.356]  Free shipping included.
[00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:09.889]  By the way, we started about a month ago really hammering this issue of the states and more of them declaring independence.
[00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.935]  Coast to Coast AM had me on a few days ago.
[00:24:13.955 --> 00:24:15.937]  Glenn Beck monitors that show and this show.
[00:24:15.957 --> 00:24:20.242]  He's going to have Representative Itza on his show tonight.
[00:24:20.262 --> 00:24:22.585]  He's leaving in about 30 minutes to go be on that show.
[00:24:26.605 --> 00:24:31.550]  So vital what you get out of this show, sir, with all the Fox News folks that don't know what's happening.
[00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.454]  And I'm going to be on Coast to Coast three hours next Monday with a bunch of other state reps.
[00:24:35.714 --> 00:24:41.019]  So thanks to you, the listeners, spreading the word, this is now becoming a major national story.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.442]  And we don't have a hope.
[00:24:44.842 --> 00:24:46.804]  The federal government is taking over right now.
[00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:54.953]  FEMA camps, FEMA camp legislation, mass arrest, mass inoculation news, youth brigades.
[00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:59.536]  Representative Dan, please continue with what you were saying.
[00:25:01.838 --> 00:25:03.640]  You filed this before Obama was even in office.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.520]  That's key.
[00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:06.502]  Right.
[00:25:06.702 --> 00:25:09.204]  I filed it last September.
[00:25:09.584 --> 00:25:12.687]  I crafted it last July and August.
[00:25:14.502 --> 00:25:17.204]  So, to me, this is not a new idea.
[00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:19.466]  This is vital for our times.
[00:25:19.526 --> 00:25:24.029]  It didn't matter to me whether it was Barack Obama or John McCain that would be elected.
[00:25:24.069 --> 00:25:26.170]  I saw the same handwriting on the wall.
[00:25:28.112 --> 00:25:31.314]  So now, it is time for the states to assert themselves.
[00:25:32.074 --> 00:25:39.460]  There is no way that we are going to take back the general government in one giant gulp.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.562]  If we have any hope at all, it's to take it back.
[00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:45.520]  One bite at a time, 50 small bites.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:26:05.886]  And it's important that the people know that the selection of their representatives at the state level is far more important than their selection at the federal level, because their state representatives and executives are far more dangerous to them.
[00:26:05.906 --> 00:26:13.068]  We can reach far deeper into their pockets and their households, but we are also their only defense against the general government.
[00:26:14.652 --> 00:26:18.395]  Um, and against the overreach of the federal government.
[00:26:18.675 --> 00:26:25.120]  And we have to now make this line in the sand and say, no, you cannot violate the Constitution.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.602]  If you do, you have no authority here.
[00:26:27.622 --> 00:26:34.848]  And for instance, uh, if some of these things become law, um, and I should clarify that.
[00:26:35.268 --> 00:26:37.710]  Think of things like H.R.
[00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.832]  45, which is the federal gun license bill.
[00:26:40.252 --> 00:26:42.234]  Notice I said H.R., not H.B.
[00:26:43.511 --> 00:26:46.954]  HB, or House Bill, refers to public law.
[00:26:48.095 --> 00:26:53.880]  HR refers to a resolution which is defined as a communication and constitutes private law.
[00:26:54.861 --> 00:27:00.145]  So it is entered into by an agreement with the two parties, all these grants that we get.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.501]  You agree to get the money, and in return you abide by these rules for that money.
[00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:09.983]  Yeah, it's federalizing the state laws for psychological testing, registration.
[00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:15.545]  They've got other bills to ban all semi-autos, or to allow the Attorney General to ban anything at will.
[00:27:15.965 --> 00:27:19.927]  They're also saying they're going to put gun owners on no-fly lists just to ban you from buying guns.
[00:27:20.467 --> 00:27:21.947]  I mean, they're coming after us.
[00:27:21.987 --> 00:27:23.328]  They're not playing games.
[00:27:23.788 --> 00:27:25.268]  Remember, these are resolutions.
[00:27:26.069 --> 00:27:30.050]  So, it is perfectly legitimate for any state to say,
[00:27:31.118 --> 00:27:33.759]  That resolution is not valid within our state.
[00:27:34.299 --> 00:27:40.281]  And anybody who attempts to enforce it, we will arrest and prosecute.
[00:27:40.301 --> 00:27:41.042]  Do what you will.
[00:27:41.582 --> 00:27:42.882]  And that's what your bill is saying.
[00:27:43.803 --> 00:27:45.603]  Explain how you will prosecute.
[00:27:46.044 --> 00:27:47.064]  Flesh that out.
[00:27:47.404 --> 00:28:00.549]  Well, you just, if they were, if they enact a federal gun license, and they attempt to enforce it, we say anybody who enforces it is committing, or attempts to enforce it, is committing a misdemeanor A, for instance.
[00:28:01.178 --> 00:28:02.259]  Which includes jail time.
[00:28:03.459 --> 00:28:04.980]  And we will prosecute them.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.022]  And we create another resolution informing the federal government that we've done it.
[00:28:11.863 --> 00:28:13.204]  Let them sit on that and smoke it.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:19.563]  Yeah, and they're trying to bill Obama as Lincoln, and he says he's going to keep the union together.
[00:28:20.844 --> 00:28:23.545]  We know the feds are concerned about the states rebelling.
[00:28:23.585 --> 00:28:25.907]  They know that the people are upset.
[00:28:25.927 --> 00:28:33.931]  80% against the war, 99% against the North American Union in polls, 99% against the bailout in polls, 98% depending on the poll.
[00:28:35.092 --> 00:28:36.052]  So, P.D.D.
[00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:37.193]  Maybe he is Lincoln.
[00:28:37.593 --> 00:28:39.314]  What was the result of the Civil War?
[00:28:39.815 --> 00:28:41.916]  What happened at the end of the Civil War?
[00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:44.665]  Reconstruction, federal control, mass slaughter.
[00:28:45.566 --> 00:28:50.549]  One step before that, there was forced repatriation of the Southerners.
[00:28:51.309 --> 00:28:54.471]  People were repatriated at the point of a gun.
[00:28:56.132 --> 00:28:58.573]  That is the end of government by consent.
[00:29:01.055 --> 00:29:01.495]  That's right.
[00:29:01.675 --> 00:29:02.996]  That was breaking the back of the stage.
[00:29:03.016 --> 00:29:04.477]  That's why the new ruler loves him so much.
[00:29:06.258 --> 00:29:09.260]  My point is... What does the 14th Amendment do?
[00:29:12.037 --> 00:29:19.466]  It makes us, it presumes to make us, or it has been construed to make us federal citizens before we are state citizens.
[00:29:20.908 --> 00:29:25.614]  And it has replaced, you know, in freeing the slaves we made everyone a slave.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.662]  And it turns a right into a privilege granted by the Roman civil government, going back to the Roman model.
[00:29:35.462 --> 00:29:36.102]  Stay there, sir.
[00:29:36.522 --> 00:29:39.003]  Wow, what an impressive state representative, so informed.
[00:29:40.043 --> 00:29:41.403]  Well, look what they're introducing.
[00:29:41.624 --> 00:29:42.564]  These are great men and women.
[00:29:43.004 --> 00:29:43.244]  Stay there.
[00:29:43.264 --> 00:29:48.426]  We're going to have you on with the other state rep, Ingbertson, as well, when we come back from New Hampshire.
[00:29:50.086 --> 00:29:51.006]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.486 --> 00:29:53.087]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.007 --> 00:29:56.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:10.177]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:30:10.657 --> 00:30:11.718]  Garden in a Can!

[00:30:30.672 --> 00:30:31.673]  Garden in a Can.
[00:30:32.093 --> 00:30:32.934]  It's that simple.
[00:30:33.294 --> 00:30:35.156]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[00:30:35.676 --> 00:30:39.639]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[00:30:59.312 --> 00:31:04.777]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:06.338]  And we knew what to do.
[00:31:06.358 --> 00:31:08.140]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:14.785]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:31:15.386 --> 00:31:23.913]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:24.298 --> 00:31:31.079]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:31.379 --> 00:31:34.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.781]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:42.982]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:33:06.271 --> 00:33:08.052]  All right, we are back live.
[00:33:08.912 --> 00:33:14.833]  Finishing up with Representative Dan Itza, who introduced the bill in New Hampshire.
[00:33:14.853 --> 00:33:16.134]  He's going to be on Glen Beck tonight.
[00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:19.114]  Hopefully on Coast to Coast AM next Monday, if he'll do it.
[00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:21.615]  Coast to Coast asked me to give him his number.
[00:33:21.635 --> 00:33:26.876]  I'll be on there with myself, riding shotgun with George Norring.
[00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:34.610]  And then we've got Representative Paul Ingridson, who's also a sponsor, has been listening to the show.
[00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.872]  Glad to have him on board.
[00:33:36.892 --> 00:33:39.314]  Going to go to him in just a moment.
[00:33:39.674 --> 00:33:53.124]  Finishing up the point you were making before the break, PDD 51, signed by Bush last year, said that in any emergency the Congress has no authority, the executive rules all.
[00:33:56.005 --> 00:34:18.079]  In the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it states that they are preparing to engage the states, the American people, and now the Army War College has announced, and it's a Defense Department statement, four months old, it's been all over the news, 20,000 combat troops, and it says the governors will serve at the pleasure of the president, the state guards are being brought unto the federal government,
[00:34:20.177 --> 00:34:25.959]  And that if the president so chooses, the governor will serve as a dual-headed federal officer.
[00:34:26.019 --> 00:34:28.980]  I mean, this is blasphemy to the Tenth Amendment.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:36.763]  This is exactly what they did with Lincoln after the Civil War, during Reconstruction, putting in puppet governors.
[00:34:37.263 --> 00:34:40.024]  It's what the British did that caused 1775 and 6.
[00:34:40.124 --> 00:34:42.765]  So I've set the table with that, sir.
[00:34:42.785 --> 00:34:43.746]  Can you, in your own words,
[00:34:45.103 --> 00:34:46.604]  A. Are you aware of all those nightmares?
[00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:51.149]  And B. If not, I hope you research it fast before you go on Glenn Beck, because it's real.
[00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:54.852]  Knowing that, what does that say?
[00:34:55.713 --> 00:34:55.933]  No.
[00:34:57.575 --> 00:35:07.985]  Though it doesn't surprise me, I guess one of the greatest travesties and mistakes we ever made was to change the title of our Chief Executive from President to Governor in 1792.
[00:35:11.792 --> 00:35:15.334]  Because that would have made the duality more apparent.
[00:35:17.935 --> 00:35:23.018]  Unfortunately, at that time, we foolishly put our trust in the federal government.
[00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:34.944]  And it's surprising that we did, because we were actually very demeritist about ratifying the Constitution.
[00:35:34.984 --> 00:35:40.606]  We were the ninth one to do so, and it almost didn't pass in New Hampshire.
[00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.173]  Uh, you know, the area that I represent was anti-federalist.
[00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:52.438]  Well, let me, let me, because you're so informed of the other issues, more informed than I am, I'm sure, in many.
[00:35:53.259 --> 00:36:04.108]  Let me just give you Presidential Decision Directive 51, John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, passed concurrently each year in the defense budget.
[00:36:05.008 --> 00:36:11.834]  And then, I mean, did you, I'm sure you heard about the 20,000 combat troops and... Oh, I'm, I'm aware of that one.
[00:36:13.211 --> 00:36:22.219]  But, you know, the idea that anybody could declare that the executive is superior to the legislature is patently unconstitutional.
[00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:36.831]  There's a reason why, you know, there's so much devoted to the legislature in Article 1, a lesser amount to the executive in Article 2, and a scant amount to the judiciary in Article 3.
[00:36:37.272 --> 00:36:40.955]  It's because the legislature is the supreme branch of government.
[00:36:42.264 --> 00:36:42.644]  That's right.
[00:36:42.704 --> 00:36:47.765]  First, they lied to us in the last hundred years and said they were co-equal, but I've read the anti-federalist and federalist papers.
[00:36:48.065 --> 00:36:56.587]  The legislature, because it comprises the greatest number of separated powers derived from the people, and is the hardest to take over with a tyranny, it is supreme.
[00:36:57.087 --> 00:37:02.108]  But instead, PDD 51 says you ain't nothing.
[00:37:02.268 --> 00:37:02.968]  It's the president.
[00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:04.669]  Well, and that's a lie.
[00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:09.990]  I mean, you know, you don't have to
[00:37:10.743 --> 00:37:14.106]  Adhere or recognize or reverence a lie.
[00:37:17.029 --> 00:37:25.776]  The judicial decision that has given the judiciary supremacy is actually a New Hampshire judicial decision from 1819.
[00:37:25.836 --> 00:37:30.540]  And everybody has been bowing to it ever since.
[00:37:31.361 --> 00:37:36.005]  But if you analyze the decision, the decision itself is a lie.
[00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:38.407]  It's a misrepresentation of the fact.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:49.722]  Sir, is the federal government, Representative, is the federal government completely morally bankrupt now and illegitimate?
[00:37:52.863 --> 00:37:54.864]  I don't know that I would go that far.
[00:37:55.164 --> 00:37:58.745]  I mean, is the federal government itself fundamentally illegitimate?
[00:37:58.805 --> 00:37:59.085]  No.
[00:37:59.305 --> 00:38:01.165]  Are many of its acts illegitimate?
[00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:01.525]  Yes.
[00:38:01.546 --> 00:38:03.086]  I mean, you have to separate the two.
[00:38:03.106 --> 00:38:06.087]  It's like separating, you know, the thin from the thinner.
[00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:26.342]  There is a constitution to which we agreed that establishes a general government for purposes of external affairs and mediation between the states.
[00:38:27.918 --> 00:38:29.778]  I mean, that's his purpose.
[00:38:29.818 --> 00:38:31.899]  But Representative, that is the meat of the issue.
[00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:52.644]  By signing Bretton Woods II and international agreements to cede final authority over major commerce and banking to an offshore bank that will control the United States and to have NORTHCOM taking over the states, that is fully breaking the compact and a new form of government, tyrannous, is being perfected.
[00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:56.655]  And we didn't stand up to it at the time.
[00:38:56.975 --> 00:39:09.280]  That is the importance of something like HCR 6 coming from each of the states, notifying them that further acts of this type are intolerable and constitute a nullification of the Constitution.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.941]  You don't just hit somebody out of the blue.
[00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:18.903]  That's why there was an Olive Branch petition and a Declaration of Independence.
[00:39:19.463 --> 00:39:22.745]  And, you know, when the War for Independence started,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:31.005]  It was not something that the colonists wanted.
[00:39:31.806 --> 00:39:43.675]  If you look at New Hampshire's first constitution in 1770, January of 1776, prior to the Declaration of Independence, it was established because the governor quit the state.
[00:39:44.455 --> 00:39:44.876]  He left.
[00:39:45.236 --> 00:39:47.357]  Got in a little rowboat and went out to sea.
[00:39:47.658 --> 00:39:49.899]  Got on a big boat and went back over to England.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.362]  And we said, my God, we don't have a government.
[00:39:54.248 --> 00:39:59.008]  And so we established one, but the introductory paragraph say...
[00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:03.493]  This is a temporary constitution until we can be reunited with Great Britain.
[00:40:03.793 --> 00:40:05.794]  There was no desire... No, I understand.
[00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:11.617]  Nobody wants war, but you know what Patrick Henry said, you can hear the clash of arms in the North.
[00:40:12.317 --> 00:40:13.458]  Why stand we here idle?
[00:40:13.898 --> 00:40:15.939]  I agree to avert physical confrontation.
[00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:19.501]  We need to get the word out, though, that great tyranny is upon us.
[00:40:22.102 --> 00:40:23.623]  I want to be fair to the next state representative.
[00:40:23.663 --> 00:40:26.144]  Stay there, though, sir, and comment on what he has to say.
[00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:26.484]  Absolutely.
[00:40:26.664 --> 00:40:27.385]  We're compatriots.
[00:40:27.605 --> 00:40:28.005]  We're buddies.
[00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:32.648]  Okay, let's bring in Representative Ingbertson.
[00:40:33.448 --> 00:40:35.730]  Paul Ingbertson joins us from New Hampshire as well.
[00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:42.434]  He's co-signatory to this bill that's been put together by Congressman Itza.
[00:40:43.454 --> 00:40:45.075]  You've been hearing what we've been discussing, sir.
[00:40:45.115 --> 00:40:46.436]  Your comments on what's going on.
[00:40:47.797 --> 00:40:52.300]  Well, first, Alex, I want to thank you for what you're trying to do nationwide.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.482]  I heard, I saw you many years ago, I think when you first started up,
[00:40:56.107 --> 00:40:59.952]  I want to congratulate you on the education you've given yourself over the course of these years.
[00:41:00.432 --> 00:41:01.974]  Thank you.
[00:41:01.994 --> 00:41:11.786]  I thought, boy, you need to learn a few things, and I'm extremely impressed with where you've gotten, and you are doing a tremendous service to the cause of freedom.
[00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:12.727]  I really honor you.
[00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:13.889]  Thank you very much for having me on.
[00:41:14.278 --> 00:41:15.419]  Well, thank you, Paul.
[00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:16.219]  We all learn.
[00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:25.526]  I think the biggest thing is I was silly and ignorant, but I had guts and guts was enough, and you guys aren't silly and ignorant, and you've got guts, so it's great.
[00:41:25.567 --> 00:41:27.148]  Tell us what's happening here.
[00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:28.028]  I mean, this is history.
[00:41:28.789 --> 00:41:38.436]  Well, I can just give you my view, and the reason I signed on, I think with you that we're way past the point of tolerating.
[00:41:39.237 --> 00:41:41.979]  We're actually abetting now, as states.
[00:41:42.731 --> 00:41:44.072]  This stuff has gone on so long.
[00:41:44.092 --> 00:41:55.938]  You know, I'm looking at the line in the Declaration of Independence, a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all obviously by this point having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
[00:41:57.358 --> 00:42:00.880]  And what was the conclusion of that statement at the Declaration of Independence?
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.083]  We have no choice, in my opinion at this point, to start looking toward dissolving this government.
[00:42:06.563 --> 00:42:10.585]  And since they're starting to see this, and they know this is happening, and since they know it will happen,
[00:42:11.192 --> 00:42:20.735]  When they begin to bring the tyrannical laws and that sort of thing, they're trying to preempt it.
[00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:25.677]  And so bills like this are critical, Dan is correct.
[00:42:26.578 --> 00:42:33.000]  The last thing any of us want to see is blood, even though Jefferson believed it was the only way we would ever keep our freedoms.
[00:42:33.837 --> 00:42:49.402]  But knowing people like this, but know that he's doing the right thing, we're trying to figure out a way to get the states back to conversation with each other, and then to get us all looking simultaneously at the federal government and saying, what is this monster we've created and what should we do about it?
[00:42:51.221 --> 00:43:07.929]  Absolutely, and my central point here is, studying the federal government and what the military was preparing, what the Pentagon has been saying for decades, they have always known that the main legitimate threat to them was the states, and they have been trying to quietly federalize
[00:43:08.689 --> 00:43:10.551]  Federally take over the counties and the cities.
[00:43:11.072 --> 00:43:13.014]  And as you said, it's very, very dark.
[00:43:13.514 --> 00:43:14.656]  It's past midnight.
[00:43:15.196 --> 00:43:16.337]  The tyranny is here.
[00:43:16.998 --> 00:43:24.226]  And if enough of a buzz is created and the people stand up and say no through their states, we may be able to avert this and back it off.
[00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:27.490]  I mean, when we look at Madoff, founder of the Nasdaq, stealing
[00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.091]  50 to 100 billion and not even getting in trouble.
[00:43:30.551 --> 00:43:37.775]  When we look at the very bankers that have stolen trillions now running the White House, Bush had them running the White House, they come in with Obama.
[00:43:38.195 --> 00:43:44.298]  I mean, it's clearly a completely bankrupt, illegitimate group of criminals that have hijacked the federal government.
[00:43:44.318 --> 00:43:48.560]  So how do we get them out of there and then get our republic back?
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.821]  Your comments on that, Representative?
[00:43:51.801 --> 00:43:57.064]  Yes, well, you know, this is the first part of this correspondence that is being recommended in this resolution.
[00:43:57.551 --> 00:44:01.353]  The states have to begin to open up dialogue with each other and analyze the problem.
[00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:04.094]  We have to do this systematically, and we have to do it now.
[00:44:04.494 --> 00:44:05.614]  It's way past time.
[00:44:05.654 --> 00:44:06.315]  We are the authority.
[00:44:06.335 --> 00:44:12.557]  The first thing that happened to us that really started this problem was the loss of the representation by the states and the federal government.
[00:44:13.177 --> 00:44:15.198]  The states now no longer have representation.
[00:44:15.538 --> 00:44:20.040]  We have representatives elected by popular, but not by the states' bodies themselves.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:26.703]  There's no corporate representation, and that's why actions like this don't seem to make sense to a lot of people in the statehouses.
[00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:30.289]  But the first part is to get back to a conversation with the states, talking to the states.
[00:44:31.889 --> 00:44:42.471]  Well, we see through federalism they're creating regional governments in the states that bypass state authority, and the states seem to think it's free federal money when it was state money to begin with.
[00:44:42.911 --> 00:44:47.812]  I'd like to get a comment from the author of the bill, Representative Dan Itza.
[00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:51.172]  It's time to stop bribing me with my own money.
[00:44:54.933 --> 00:44:55.713]  This is like
[00:44:57.431 --> 00:45:09.855]  Uh... parents who created a child known as the the general government and left discipline for so long that it has become an incorrigible child.
[00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:13.717]  And it's time for the parents to take the child to the woodshed.
[00:45:15.097 --> 00:45:17.078]  That's terrific.
[00:45:17.978 --> 00:45:18.518]  It's true.
[00:45:18.538 --> 00:45:24.941]  I mean, we created this and now foreign bankers hijacked it and are telling us we're slaves?
[00:45:26.405 --> 00:45:32.408]  I sit on the Education Committee, and of course I have communications with my own school superintendent and that sort of thing.
[00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:36.971]  And, you know, the federal government has no role whatsoever in education, period.
[00:45:37.011 --> 00:45:37.551]  There's no role.
[00:45:37.571 --> 00:45:39.412]  They have no... They should be... They can't tax for it.
[00:45:39.452 --> 00:45:41.013]  They can't pass laws about it.
[00:45:41.813 --> 00:45:45.475]  But instead, what they do is they raise these monies, and they get us tied to it.
[00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:48.097]  And then they come on with a bigger one, a bigger bite now.
[00:45:48.157 --> 00:45:51.959]  Now, No Child Left Behind is the actual official takeover of public education in the schools.
[00:45:52.731 --> 00:45:54.492]  By the federal government.
[00:45:54.552 --> 00:45:56.554]  The whole package is absolutely outrageous.
[00:45:56.594 --> 00:45:57.934]  And now they're doing it with their own money.
[00:45:57.974 --> 00:46:05.199]  And believe it or not, your local people believe that if we don't have the federal money, we're going to somehow go broke if they didn't get the stuff from us.
[00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:11.263]  And if they were not siphoning it off into their own pockets all the way along the way, we're only getting a tiny portion of it back anyway.
[00:46:11.663 --> 00:46:12.464]  It's a madness.
[00:46:12.604 --> 00:46:13.785]  It's almost beyond belief.
[00:46:14.076 --> 00:46:15.236]  Well, look at what they've done.
[00:46:15.296 --> 00:46:20.477]  Now they have by federal law, if the states take the money, the army is in all the schools.
[00:46:20.857 --> 00:46:26.399]  They're threatening the children to arrest them if they don't sign up for the military, saying it's the law.
[00:46:26.439 --> 00:46:27.639]  That's on record everywhere.
[00:46:27.659 --> 00:46:30.619]  Uh, they are... Excuse me a moment.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.740]  I mean... I mean, it is serious.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.120]  Go ahead.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.881]  Hello?
[00:46:36.501 --> 00:46:37.061]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:38.021]  Okay.
[00:46:38.381 --> 00:46:42.322]  No, I thought somebody... I thought somebody was trying to reach me, but apparently not.
[00:46:42.864 --> 00:46:44.648]  No, I understand you guys are in your offices and busy.
[00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:48.066]  Gentlemen, you've got the floor, both of you.
[00:46:48.086 --> 00:46:50.027]  I mean, have a dialogue about where this is going.
[00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:52.249]  People say, oh, we're not going to have the states pass this.
[00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.929]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:46:52.949 --> 00:46:57.052]  We'll just roll over and die then, because the nation's been seized by offshore banks.
[00:46:58.473 --> 00:47:12.703]  If the fires of liberty are lit, and in these times of adversity they are, we have a good chance of having a counter-revolution and taking our country back and restoring it against these globalists who are the real revolutionaries, the real hijackers.
[00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:15.926]  Well, that's an interesting point.
[00:47:16.387 --> 00:47:19.729]  One of my papers I write about the New World Order.
[00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:24.852]  The New World Order is what was created in 1776 for the New World.
[00:47:25.412 --> 00:47:31.136]  What we're gravitating back toward now is the Old World Order, European-style aristocracy.
[00:47:32.437 --> 00:47:42.223]  And it's time for us to hitch up our britches and, as Pastor Garrett Lear, the Patriot pastor, says, somebody's stolen my country and I want her back.
[00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:48.204]  And a further comment, by the way, this bill came into committee yesterday.
[00:47:48.224 --> 00:48:00.809]  I don't know if you knew about this, Alex, but the Federal State Relations Committee in New Hampshire's State House and we had had a count going on.
[00:48:01.009 --> 00:48:06.292]  We'd heard about the Democrats talking to each other and basically had almost uniformly agreed to go along with this bill.
[00:48:07.232 --> 00:48:13.395]  And with one exception that we knew of, the Republicans all were planning to vote for this bill.
[00:48:14.304 --> 00:48:19.967]  And an odd thing happened on the way to the forum, I guess you could say.
[00:48:20.187 --> 00:48:30.191]  But when the bill came up, it just turned out that the Speaker, who's a Democrat, was standing at the door of that committee as they voted.
[00:48:30.812 --> 00:48:32.092]  And the vote went the other way.
[00:48:32.853 --> 00:48:35.274]  We wound up with 11 to 7 against passage of this bill.
[00:48:35.754 --> 00:48:42.397]  I suggest to you that you're already on top of it, and that is that certain powers that be and certain establishment players
[00:48:43.396 --> 00:48:44.337]  Are part of the problem.
[00:48:44.897 --> 00:48:46.919]  And they're in the states, they're all over the place.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:59.470]  And the interesting thing is, when that, in preparation for that vote, you know, somebody makes the motion of inexpedient to legislate, which was the Vice Chair, and then there's discussion of the bill.
[00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:07.156]  There was not one stilling argument, I don't believe any argument, in favor of the motion of inexpedient to legislate.
[00:49:07.777 --> 00:49:09.958]  There were four arguments against it.
[00:49:10.799 --> 00:49:11.820]  And then the vote was taken.
[00:49:13.041 --> 00:49:17.905]  And without any rational support for the motion, it passed.
[00:49:20.247 --> 00:49:21.588]  And Alex, that's what it's coming to.
[00:49:21.628 --> 00:49:22.969]  We've seen this in the last couple years.
[00:49:22.989 --> 00:49:24.410]  We've been a Republican House for a long time.
[00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:29.133]  In the last two years, we're finding that we can stand up and argue the merits, argue the logic, argue everything.
[00:49:29.173 --> 00:49:33.937]  There's basically silence on the other side, and then the vote just goes socialist, as you could say.
[00:49:34.117 --> 00:49:35.078]  It just goes sideways.
[00:49:35.888 --> 00:49:38.850]  Yeah, they've spent decades setting this up.
[00:49:39.271 --> 00:49:39.511]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:40.251 --> 00:49:41.973]  And they're now going for broke.
[00:49:43.094 --> 00:49:46.736]  And we're going to be reorganized.
[00:49:46.756 --> 00:49:50.780]  You know, the big international banks did this in the Soviet Union, they did it in Germany, they did it in China.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.502]  It's all now declassified and they're doing it here.
[00:49:54.062 --> 00:49:55.964]  And folks, I'm not playing games.
[00:49:56.004 --> 00:49:58.065]  We've shown you the documents, had the guests on.
[00:49:58.626 --> 00:50:02.088]  They plan to really gut this country and do some bad things.
[00:50:03.189 --> 00:50:05.211]  So many people, men, are going to
[00:50:07.156 --> 00:50:11.118]  If this goes bad, if we're unable to stop this, they're going to wish to God they'd have joined us.
[00:50:11.198 --> 00:50:20.601]  People who serve the evil, I think, are just so cynical and lazy and only into their own personal bobbles that they don't understand that this is historic.
[00:50:21.502 --> 00:50:23.082]  This isn't just corruption as usual.
[00:50:23.682 --> 00:50:32.986]  Alex, we have, you know, as a support for that, we've been called by a number of shows, including some people who do radio shows, military individuals who do radio shows.
[00:50:33.444 --> 00:50:37.728]  There are people who are in all places, in government and other places, that do understand what's going on.
[00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.272]  Let's talk about that when we get back, gentlemen.
[00:50:41.292 --> 00:50:43.534]  If you could stay with me five more minutes after the break.
[00:50:43.554 --> 00:50:50.661]  We'll also want to give out your websites and contact information for people that want to join you or get the bill and try to get it passed in their state.
[00:50:51.101 --> 00:50:53.543]  The fight is ours and we'll take it up in our hands.
[00:50:53.924 --> 00:50:55.766]  Our destiny lies before us.
[00:51:00.504 --> 00:51:04.327]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[00:51:17.059 --> 00:51:17.439]  Israeli gas masks $20.

[00:51:28.169 --> 00:51:31.312]  Snowshoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen.

[00:52:09.211 --> 00:52:10.031]  Who is the enemy?
[00:52:10.572 --> 00:52:11.072]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:11.372 --> 00:52:12.332]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:12.352 --> 00:52:13.713]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:13.733 --> 00:52:15.374]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:15.734 --> 00:52:22.477]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:22.877 --> 00:52:23.317]  Some U.S.
[00:52:23.357 --> 00:52:29.000]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:33.183]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:33.203 --> 00:52:35.364]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.014 --> 00:53:03.656]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[00:53:03.956 --> 00:53:08.978]  At EnduringRose.com we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[00:53:09.438 --> 00:53:13.700]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.561]  Enduring Rose can help.
[00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:22.043]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.
[00:53:22.484 --> 00:53:25.665]  These roses, forever preserved in either white or yellow gold, will
[00:53:29.394 --> 00:53:29.794]  We're good to go.
[00:54:03.248 --> 00:54:05.849]  It is not only to the strong that this fight beckons.
[00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:07.289]  All of you can do something.
[00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:17.972]  We have two great representatives on who I think have put together the best of all the states I've read.
[00:54:17.992 --> 00:54:18.913]  It's over 20 now.
[00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:30.396]  We'll continue next week with more state representatives as we beat this drum to rise the people up from every hill and mountain, from every church top, from the lowlands to the seacoast, telling the people
[00:54:31.721 --> 00:54:32.607]  That 1776 is upon us, yet again!
[00:54:38.446 --> 00:54:44.368]  In closing with Representative Dan Gidsom and Representative Paul Ingbertson.
[00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:48.030]  Gentlemen, how do we help you get this done in New Hampshire?
[00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:49.830]  Contact the media, make them cover it.
[00:54:50.191 --> 00:54:51.491]  Looks like it's already starting to happen.
[00:54:53.012 --> 00:54:54.392]  How do we get other states to do this?
[00:54:54.432 --> 00:55:01.935]  I mean, as you said earlier, Representative Ingbertson, we need to educate the states, the city councils, the counties.
[00:55:02.475 --> 00:55:04.336]  I mean, really, it's education here, isn't it?
[00:55:06.531 --> 00:55:12.354]  The first thing is that everybody who's listening in New Hampshire needs to assail the government.
[00:55:12.394 --> 00:55:23.819]  They need to call their representatives, they need to call the leadership of both parties in the legislature, and let them know that they are demanding the defense of their liberty from the federal government.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:32.524]  And there's going to be a rally at the Statehouse the day that the vote is taken.
[00:55:32.564 --> 00:55:34.865]  Presumably right now that's March 4th.
[00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:39.082]  Okay, we need to get other rallies going around the country.
[00:55:39.122 --> 00:55:40.723]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters, listeners.
[00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:42.163]  Start the movement now.
[00:55:42.263 --> 00:55:44.044]  Call the state reps who have introduced it in your state.
[00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.265]  Tell them you want to set a rally and help them.
[00:55:46.685 --> 00:55:48.565]  Buy radio ads, do whatever you've got to do.
[00:55:48.886 --> 00:55:50.546]  Going to Representative Ingbertson.
[00:55:51.006 --> 00:55:52.567]  Sir, should people call you guys?
[00:55:52.587 --> 00:55:53.587]  Should they contact you?
[00:55:53.947 --> 00:55:55.408]  I mean, how can we help?
[00:55:56.468 --> 00:56:00.530]  Well, I recommend they do that, but I think the more important thing is to call the reps.
[00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:01.510]  They're 400.
[00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.551]  Very easy to get all the addresses.
[00:56:02.571 --> 00:56:05.012]  You can mail to them simultaneously if you go to nh.gov.
[00:56:06.656 --> 00:56:08.037]  It's not hard to find that stuff.
[00:56:08.397 --> 00:56:10.398]  I'll tell you this for one reason and one reason only.
[00:56:10.819 --> 00:56:27.709]  I don't want people to be overwhelmed out there with this, but what we're getting in media here, and Dan can tell you more specifically, he had contact yesterday with the Concord Monitor, I believe it was, Dan, you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong, where they simply said, what in the heck are you bothering with this kind of crap for when we have real problems?
[00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:31.351]  And I'm telling you folks, that's the media you're talking about right now.
[00:56:31.411 --> 00:56:34.533]  You can't get any leverage with stuff like this because we have real problems.
[00:56:36.572 --> 00:56:41.235]  My point to Dan was, if this is a real problem, folks, I think I'm going to quit government.
[00:56:41.275 --> 00:56:42.336]  I don't even belong here.
[00:56:42.796 --> 00:56:45.818]  This is the most real and the most serious problem we've got facing us.
[00:56:45.918 --> 00:56:46.439]  Well, that's the point.
[00:56:46.459 --> 00:56:48.020]  That's the way the media is handling it around here.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:53.003]  Anything they can do to become the media, these people out there with their phones and their emails and all that stuff,
[00:56:53.439 --> 00:56:55.040]  Anything they can do to become the media would be good.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.682]  Well, I was about to say, that's the plan.
[00:56:56.742 --> 00:57:03.987]  As the feds are bankrupting things by design, we have their own documents to then make everybody get on the government jet here.
[00:57:04.107 --> 00:57:06.589]  I mean, this is to sell us on an expanded wave.
[00:57:06.609 --> 00:57:07.050]  Go ahead.
[00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:12.514]  I'd like to read you something from Federalist Paper 46, written by James Madison.
[00:57:13.735 --> 00:57:22.682]  Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached
[00:57:23.283 --> 00:57:43.107]  And by which the militia officers are appointed forms the barrier against the enterprise of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of, notwithstanding the military establishments of the several kingdoms of Europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear.
[00:57:43.967 --> 00:57:51.669]  The governments are afraid to trust the people with arms, and it is not certain that with this aid they would alone be able to shake off their yoke.
[00:57:52.697 --> 00:58:16.589]  But were the people to possess the additional advantage of local government, chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed, with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.
[00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:20.591]  Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with suspicion.
[00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:25.432]  That they would not be less able to defend the rights which they would be in actual possession.
[00:58:27.893 --> 00:58:29.413]  Alright, we are out of time.
[00:58:29.433 --> 00:58:32.735]  I want to have you both up again next week because I know you have more to say.
[00:58:33.335 --> 00:58:39.497]  So, to both of you representatives, Paul Ingbertson and to Dan Itza, thank you so much.
[00:58:41.858 --> 00:58:43.459]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.359 --> 00:58:46.660]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.585 --> 00:58:51.147]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.267 --> 00:58:55.874]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:56.014 --> 00:58:58.778]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:58.978 --> 00:59:01.822]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:02.022 --> 00:59:06.749]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:06.949 --> 00:59:07.870]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:08.091 --> 00:59:11.035]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:11.335 --> 00:59:18.224]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:18.324 --> 00:59:21.448]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:21.609 --> 00:59:21.869]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:24.272 --> 00:59:26.513]  Or, on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:59:36.357 --> 00:59:37.498]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:37.518 --> 00:59:38.158]  Take action today.
[00:59:38.178 --> 00:59:39.679]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:52.364 --> 00:59:54.266]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:59:54.747 --> 00:59:57.510]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.419 --> 01:00:21.840]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.461]  I am congratulating all of you out there.
[01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:28.303]  For a month we've been covering the rebellion of the states against the tyranny.
[01:00:28.703 --> 01:00:31.804]  The federal government has been completely hijacked and is illegitimate.
[01:00:32.825 --> 01:00:38.047]  They are bringing in one of the most vicious tyrannies ever seen on record.
[01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:43.830]  Our worst analysis turned out to be less than what the truth was.
[01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.311]  It was far worse than we thought.
[01:00:46.511 --> 01:00:49.872]  These are the men, the time that try men and women's souls.
[01:00:50.853 --> 01:00:53.994]  And we just want to commend and thank all of you that are here and spreading the word.
[01:00:54.494 --> 01:00:59.536]  Because this issue of the states saying no to the globalists, this is the only hope we've got.
[01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:02.317]  They're bankrupting us by design to bring us into receivership.
[01:01:02.737 --> 01:01:05.038]  For the next hour he's going to be in studio with us.
[01:01:05.798 --> 01:01:07.218]  George Humphrey, my good friend.
[01:01:07.258 --> 01:01:10.039]  I remember when I first started getting active in like 1995.
[01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:17.845]  And I remember, I was running around volunteering for Pat Buchanan, because he was speaking out against the New World Order at the time.
[01:01:17.865 --> 01:01:21.708]  A lot of them were hating, the point is, we were just learning.
[01:01:22.209 --> 01:01:26.572]  And I went over to drop off a bunch of signs to another volunteer and it was at George Humphrey's house.
[01:01:27.773 --> 01:01:31.896]  And George, a former city council member, successful businessman, degreed economist,
[01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:36.061]  That's why we have him here today in studio with us after the show's over.
[01:01:36.122 --> 01:01:43.267]  It's the last interview we're doing for the Obama Deception because I want to insert him some into this film that you can already pre-order.
[01:01:43.287 --> 01:01:44.248]  It'll be done in a few weeks.
[01:01:44.608 --> 01:01:48.791]  Pre-order it now at InfoWars.com today.
[01:01:48.811 --> 01:01:49.672]  I hope that you will do that.
[01:01:52.759 --> 01:02:14.714]  I want you to recap what you said in that brief interview earlier this week when you were just here visiting, when you were on for ten minutes, and then let's go through where you see the future and the different divergent paths that the future can bring that we literally are the governors of if we simply take action and put our will into it.
[01:02:16.115 --> 01:02:17.436]  George Humphrey, great to have you here.
[01:02:17.576 --> 01:02:20.037]  First of all, I am so glad to be here.
[01:02:20.618 --> 01:02:26.441]  And Alex, what you are doing and what you've done in this last six months is just awesome.
[01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:29.823]  And what you've been doing for the last 15 years is just incredible.
[01:02:29.863 --> 01:02:35.286]  And it's been a real pleasure and honor to be your friend and ally in this period of time.
[01:02:35.306 --> 01:02:36.647]  I mean, you know what?
[01:02:37.047 --> 01:02:40.329]  When we first got involved in it, we were kind of scared we'd lose our friends.
[01:02:41.189 --> 01:02:45.855]  I just finished being a city council member and I was wanting to run for U.S.
[01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:49.701]  Congress and I said, God, if I talk about this stuff, I won't be able to run for Congress.
[01:02:50.742 --> 01:02:53.746]  And I went, well, what's more important, telling the truth or doing this?
[01:02:54.387 --> 01:02:55.589]  And so for the last 10, 12 years,
[01:02:58.496 --> 01:02:59.857]  There is a lot of ostracism.
[01:02:59.897 --> 01:03:02.679]  There's a lot of people who made fun, who derided us.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.220]  You know, there goes Alex.
[01:03:04.301 --> 01:03:05.301]  There goes George.
[01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:08.304]  Those are the crazy guys talking about the New World Order.
[01:03:08.824 --> 01:03:17.991]  But over and over and over, and especially this last four or five months, more and more and more people are coming up to me.
[01:03:18.071 --> 01:03:19.993]  I was just at Starbucks on the way here.
[01:03:20.623 --> 01:03:29.330]  Three folks, just as straight as they can be, you know, frat guys come up to me, aren't you the guy, da-da-da, and they knew all about your show, and they had just become aware of this stuff.
[01:03:30.011 --> 01:03:35.356]  Everybody is becoming aware, and information is the key.
[01:03:35.996 --> 01:03:37.157]  And that's what we're here to do.
[01:03:37.217 --> 01:03:38.958]  We don't have to pump anything up.
[01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:41.080]  There's so much information.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.801]  This is not conspiracy theory.
[01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:48.545]  It's just the history of what's going on in our culture and what is happening right now.
[01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:50.606]  And we have a choice.
[01:03:51.567 --> 01:03:53.608]  And the first thing is to become educated.
[01:03:54.489 --> 01:03:59.933]  And clearly, clearly, clearly, our nation, our culture,
[01:04:01.613 --> 01:04:10.840]  is addicted to materialism, to the soft life, to a very unhealthy way of going through life.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:30.394]  We've forgotten God, we've forgotten our families, and you know, just like in Alcoholics Anonymous, they talk about the different steps of denial, and derision, and of anger, and of fear, and of depression, and then finally, finally of acceptance.
[01:04:31.465 --> 01:04:51.038]  And it's my opinion that with this recession, which is actually a depression that we're going into right now, is that a majority of the people in this country are going from derision, and they've been going through anger, and now they're going into fear and depression.
[01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:52.199]  Stay there, gotta break.
[01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:58.544]  George Humphrey, our guest in studio, will continue with this analysis on the other side as the resistance mounts.
[01:04:59.679 --> 01:05:07.766]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:05:07.926 --> 01:05:12.330]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:17.014]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:18.575]  It's a documented fact.
[01:05:19.435 --> 01:05:26.037]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:05:26.218 --> 01:05:38.042]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:41.963]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:44.964]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:05:45.704 --> 01:05:49.365]  FPP is so affordable, you can't afford to do without.
[01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:56.128]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:05:56.248 --> 01:05:56.868]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:05:57.008 --> 01:06:06.191]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:08.312]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:09.181 --> 01:06:10.222]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:10.722 --> 01:06:11.242]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:11.523 --> 01:06:12.543]  This is his M.O.s.
[01:06:12.563 --> 01:06:13.824]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:13.864 --> 01:06:15.525]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:15.885 --> 01:06:22.650]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.490]  Some U.S.
[01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:29.154]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:29.854 --> 01:06:33.337]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.519]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:05.292]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:10.636]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:07:10.916 --> 01:07:16.000]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.843]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:07:20.143 --> 01:07:21.864]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:07:22.184 --> 01:07:24.905]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:28.167]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:07:28.407 --> 01:07:31.948]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:07:32.209 --> 01:07:36.731]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:37.791]  Do your part.
[01:07:38.071 --> 01:07:40.332]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:07:40.672 --> 01:07:46.715]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink.
[01:07:46.715 --> 01:07:47.415]  We're good to go.
[01:08:17.361 --> 01:08:22.005]  George Humphrey is our guest in studio, filmmaker, author, resistor of the New World Order.
[01:08:23.406 --> 01:08:27.910]  He came up in that early 1990s wave that so many of us activated in.
[01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.213]  We felt it in our spirit, all the evidence was there.
[01:08:31.673 --> 01:08:36.277]  Now a wave, I would say a thousand times bigger, a wavelength has begun.
[01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:37.298]  The enemy sees it.
[01:08:37.958 --> 01:08:41.281]  We've analyzed their attack profile, George, and it's all about stopping the states.
[01:08:41.321 --> 01:08:45.245]  And more and more I realize that is the key point and they are scared.
[01:08:45.865 --> 01:08:49.569]  And I think of the people just energized and realize they have victory.
[01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:53.653]  And the phony Christian churches have taught them this is the end.
[01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:56.115]  You've got to lay down to corruption.
[01:08:56.155 --> 01:08:57.056]  You can't stop it.
[01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.038]  That's the opposite of what Christ taught.
[01:08:59.299 --> 01:08:59.759]  Absolutely.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.142]  And regardless of the consequences, we're always to do right.
[01:09:04.043 --> 01:09:06.765]  And the clergy response teams, the brainwashed FEMA patrols.
[01:09:07.145 --> 01:09:08.126]  Now it's all public.
[01:09:08.466 --> 01:09:09.867]  Everything we said came true.
[01:09:10.307 --> 01:09:14.010]  Now people that laughed at us are remembering and they're understanding.
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.891]  So now is the time of maximum effort.
[01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:17.032]  Please continue.
[01:09:17.392 --> 01:09:18.293]  Well, absolutely.
[01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:24.277]  And I think we should go back to our philosophy about what life is and what you just said.
[01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:31.719]  The one that most people call Jesus, who I call Yeshua, he taught individual freedom.
[01:09:32.059 --> 01:09:45.843]  He taught about spirituality, about divinity, that each and every one of us are powerful, we're divine, we're sovereign, and that one person can make a difference.
[01:09:46.952 --> 01:10:06.628]  Seventy-five years ago we saw Mahatma Gandhi do the same thing in India, and that's what you and I and others are doing, is that not only are we sharing the information of the First Awakening, but we're also sharing the information that every single one of us is a part of the healing or the destruction of this culture.
[01:10:07.068 --> 01:10:10.491]  And I choose, and I think you choose, to be a part of the healing.
[01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:12.993]  And the first thing is to get the right information.
[01:10:13.553 --> 01:10:27.425]  And quite clearly, quite clearly, the culture of America has been, and of the Western cultures, has been manipulated very, very cleverly to make people, put people in victim consciousness.
[01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:29.822]  And to make us addicted.
[01:10:30.242 --> 01:10:36.507]  And we quite clearly have become addicted to mammon, or materialism, or to the soft life.
[01:10:37.327 --> 01:10:42.531]  And in Alcoholics Anonymous, they always say the first step is acknowledgement.
[01:10:43.091 --> 01:10:46.534]  And then they talk about the different steps of breaking through.
[01:10:46.554 --> 01:10:51.617]  And in most, it's denial, it's depression.
[01:10:52.558 --> 01:11:02.041]  I mean derision, and then it's anger, and then fear, and then depression, and then finally acceptance.
[01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:09.023]  And for years and years, the information that Alex and I put out, it was denied, denied, denied.
[01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:10.584]  And then there was a lot of derision.
[01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:11.584]  Oh, there goes Alex.
[01:11:11.744 --> 01:11:12.705]  Oh, there goes George.
[01:11:13.065 --> 01:11:16.066]  Those crazy guys talking about conspiracy theory.
[01:11:16.986 --> 01:11:28.733]  And now, with what's going on, people have gone through kind of the angry phase, but now they're going into the deep fear and depression stages, because they're losing their money.
[01:11:28.753 --> 01:11:39.240]  And as an economist, I always like to look at the economy, because it is always the precursor to the political, cultural, and environmental changes.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.441]  And George, you wrote a book
[01:11:41.201 --> 01:11:56.725]  Was it 10 or 11 years ago where you said, with the derivatives, they were getting us all in debt, getting us leveraged, they were buying up the world, while the fiat Ponzi scheme had value, and then they leave us holding the bag, and then they come in with the only currency as the saviors, and totally take over society?
[01:11:56.825 --> 01:11:57.366]  You're right!
[01:11:57.586 --> 01:11:59.006]  Well, yeah.
[01:11:59.186 --> 01:12:08.549]  I mean, it's not me being right, it's just the information is there, and I've written three different booklets, and you've written several different booklets, and 12 years ago,
[01:12:10.069 --> 01:12:13.290]  Twelve years ago, we were laying this whole scenario out.
[01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:17.631]  I thought that the bubble was going to burst three or four years ago.
[01:12:18.111 --> 01:12:25.012]  But very skillfully, the masters of deception have been able to keep pumping, pumping, pumping up the bubble.
[01:12:25.372 --> 01:12:27.313]  But all bubbles eventually break.
[01:12:27.933 --> 01:12:32.434]  And this economic bubble, through the structured investment vehicles, the derivatives,
[01:12:34.028 --> 01:12:43.135]  It's the biggest bubble ever in the whole world, bigger than the real estate bubble, bigger than any of the other bubbles that we have seen.
[01:12:43.816 --> 01:13:02.091]  And because these derivatives were unregulated, unregulated, our slave masters were able to take profits at 20, 30, 50, and sometimes 100 to 1 as they pushed up these derived indexes.
[01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:09.706]  And that's what caused this huge... I mean it's so far past bankruptcy that...
[01:13:11.224 --> 01:13:13.825]  Words don't even describe where we are.
[01:13:13.885 --> 01:13:18.327]  We were talking about bankruptcy, you know, 15 years ago.
[01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:25.949]  But with, as most of you are aware of, with a fiat currency, it's designed to fail.
[01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:33.952]  With a fiat currency, which is what we have, it is mathematically impossible to pay off the debt.
[01:13:35.319 --> 01:13:51.475]  And with this new bailout or stimulus package that is being created for us by Brother Obama, it is just the height of insanity to think that we're going to be able to come out of this doldrums of this depression by creating more debt.
[01:13:52.576 --> 01:13:57.340]  You can't come out of something by creating more debt, which is exactly what we're doing.
[01:13:58.223 --> 01:14:14.450]  And the figures that I have right now, not from some new age guy or from some hardcore, you know, wild person, but from CNBC, is that the stimulus package, this bailout, is not 700 or 800 billion dollars.
[01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.531]  It's 7.3 trillion dollars.
[01:14:23.012 --> 01:14:30.057]  That's with the T. Now remember, our gross national product this year is going to be about ten and a half, ten trillion dollars.
[01:14:30.777 --> 01:14:45.028]  And so what we're putting out is something that in adjusted terms, in adjusted inflation, is two and a half times greater than all of the money spent on World War II.
[01:14:46.569 --> 01:14:49.691]  Now, that gum, that's a whole lot of money.
[01:14:50.911 --> 01:14:53.554]  And we're just now getting into this.
[01:14:54.235 --> 01:15:03.725]  And the really, truly wild part about all of this is, is that over three and a half trillion dollars of the seven trillion dollars
[01:15:05.262 --> 01:15:21.455]  is from the Federal Reserve Board that is being issued to financial institutions without, again, without the jurisdiction or the vote of Congress, without accounting, there is no transparency.
[01:15:21.815 --> 01:15:31.863]  Bernanke has refused to give the information and this by itself, you know, this last week they're talking about an eight hundred billion dollar stimulus program.
[01:15:32.423 --> 01:15:34.265]  And that's a heck of a lot of money.
[01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:40.111]  That is like twice as much in real terms as Louisiana Purchase.
[01:15:40.471 --> 01:15:53.064]  But what we're talking about is four times that amount that is being put into the hands of the financial institutions, the very, very folks who created the situation, without
[01:15:54.082 --> 01:16:00.028]  Any jurisdiction without any vote and without any knowledge by the American citizens where this is going.
[01:16:00.588 --> 01:16:07.715]  This is your money, this is our money, this is our economy, and this is absolute criminal behavior.
[01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:12.920]  George, Monday, I don't want to get your take on this because it segues into what you were just discussing or dovetails.
[01:16:14.679 --> 01:16:18.743]  Bloomberg Financial, that I have a lot of respect for compared to any other publication.
[01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:24.168]  It's New World Order, but it's for real people in the system, so they tell the truth most of the time.
[01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:26.110]  But the headline was $9.7 trillion so far in banker bailout.
[01:16:30.894 --> 01:16:38.517]  And then it showed the numbers that that was over 90% of all mortgages at 2008 levels, when they were worth more.
[01:16:38.917 --> 01:16:54.463]  So, they made us think this was all about bailing out mortgages, but when they passed the banker bailout bill on October 3rd, 2008, the next day on Saturday, Paulson said, oh, we're not even going to use it for that now, because that's not what it's for.
[01:16:54.523 --> 01:16:57.964]  So they've already generated enough money to them, and then they say it's secret where it went.
[01:16:58.976 --> 01:17:03.359]  To pay off 90 plus percent of the mortgages in the nation.
[01:17:03.879 --> 01:17:05.620]  So it's a complete fraud.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:10.723]  So comment on that and then they won't say where the money's going, where do you think it's going?
[01:17:11.184 --> 01:17:14.426]  I mean they have some leaks that they're buying up infrastructure, massing the cash.
[01:17:15.026 --> 01:17:18.009]  Well, the very first monies went to J.P.
[01:17:18.069 --> 01:17:21.473]  Morgan, and I cannot prove this, but J.P.
[01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:25.356]  Morgan is very connected with the metals trade, and especially with silver.
[01:17:25.837 --> 01:17:31.142]  And about four and a half months ago, silver was selling for $18.70, and within about two weeks it went down to $11, and then down to $8.70.
[01:17:35.345 --> 01:17:45.990]  Now, at the very, very same period of time, over 60% of the silver that is traded in this country is over-the-counter in the small gun shops and the trading areas.
[01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:49.031]  And suddenly, all of the silver disappeared.
[01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:53.553]  And it's still very, very difficult to buy or find silver bullion.
[01:17:54.249 --> 01:18:05.352]  Now, in a free market society, if the silver disappears, or if it goes away, or if it's difficult, the price of the product or the commodity should go up and up and up.
[01:18:05.812 --> 01:18:08.393]  And yet, the price went down by over 55%.
[01:18:09.533 --> 01:18:12.674]  Now, quite clearly, that is manipulation.
[01:18:12.714 --> 01:18:15.615]  And because silver is a relatively small market,
[01:18:16.215 --> 01:18:31.910]  It is easy to manipulate and you know and all the figures that we're talking about don't even include the hundreds of billions if not several you know one to two trillion dollars that has been put into the plunge protection team
[01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:34.072]  In the last year and a half.
[01:18:34.172 --> 01:18:37.155]  And yesterday the market was down about 300 points.
[01:18:37.215 --> 01:18:40.057]  In the last half hour the market went up 200 points.
[01:18:40.117 --> 01:18:42.239]  And quite clearly it went straight up.
[01:18:42.299 --> 01:18:43.940]  Markets don't go straight up.
[01:18:44.441 --> 01:18:49.525]  And that was clearly the auspices of the Plunge Protection Team.
[01:18:49.905 --> 01:18:53.909]  Now the problem, and again, we're supposed to have a free country.
[01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:56.456]  We're supposed to have a free country.
[01:18:57.036 --> 01:19:03.298]  And the accounting of the monies is the foundation or the basis of what's going on.
[01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:15.463]  And if you can't account for the money, and whether the number is $7 trillion or whether it's $9 trillion or whether it's $12 or $15 trillion, we don't know.
[01:19:16.263 --> 01:19:29.418]  But just, when I was a city council member, I always thought it was kind of interesting because when we'd have a project that would go for a couple hundred thousand dollars or five hundred thousand dollars, there'd be debate for hours and hours about where it would go.
[01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:34.043]  But when the projects would get up to fifteen, twenty million dollars,
[01:19:34.924 --> 01:19:41.146]  That was a number that was too big for a lot of people to understand, and they just go, you know, what do you think?
[01:19:41.206 --> 01:19:42.886]  Just pass it, you know, go ahead.
[01:19:43.386 --> 01:19:52.429]  And now, instead of talking about hundreds of thousands or millions or even billions now, is that what we're talking about is trillions.
[01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:53.109]  Gotta break!
[01:19:53.169 --> 01:19:53.609]  Gotta break!
[01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:54.730]  I'm back with George Humphrey.
[01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.910]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:58.471]  This is Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:01.391 --> 01:20:03.332]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:20:03.956 --> 01:20:06.444]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:20:07.026 --> 01:20:11.220]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[01:20:11.969 --> 01:20:13.710]  You know that you need to prepare.
[01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:17.092]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:20:17.472 --> 01:20:20.473]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:32.160]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.763]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[01:20:38.763 --> 01:20:39.403]  I think so.
[01:21:01.032 --> 01:21:03.953]  Please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:21:03.973 --> 01:21:06.233]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:21:06.273 --> 01:21:07.774]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:21:07.794 --> 01:21:09.434]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:21:09.514 --> 01:21:12.355]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:21:12.395 --> 01:21:18.056]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Forlateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:21:18.136 --> 01:21:25.638]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:21:25.678 --> 01:21:30.559]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:21:34.346 --> 01:21:35.406]  How dare you?
[01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:41.848]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:21:41.868 --> 01:21:44.668]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:21:44.748 --> 01:21:50.989]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:53.810]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:56.070]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.811]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:22:00.467 --> 01:22:01.708]  10 Enters of Might is February 13, 2008.
[01:22:01.788 --> 01:22:05.772]  Gold, 930, 660 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 963.49, 481.75 for half, 240.75 for quarter.
[01:22:05.812 --> 01:22:06.252]  That's 963.49, 481.75, and 240.75.
[01:22:18.032 --> 01:22:19.113]  We all want liberty.
[01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.515]  Some give their lives for it.
[01:22:20.695 --> 01:22:22.577]  A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[01:22:22.677 --> 01:22:24.840]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.460]  For what?
[01:22:25.681 --> 01:22:37.033]  February 28th, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown, Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler to cover monetary policy.
[01:22:37.233 --> 01:22:37.573]  We're good.
[01:22:59.415 --> 01:23:02.697]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:23:02.857 --> 01:23:06.939]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:23:07.119 --> 01:23:18.544]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:23:18.784 --> 01:23:24.607]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:23:24.847 --> 01:23:25.468]  We're good to go.
[01:23:48.268 --> 01:23:52.031]  There might still be time to turn this around, but it's up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:25.660]  What are you going to do?
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:32.263]  But I know this, letting the same bankers that have robbed the daylights out of us and are engineering this society into hell aren't going to fix anything.
[01:24:33.604 --> 01:24:35.585]  Because they're doing what they want to do.
[01:24:36.045 --> 01:24:37.726]  To them, it is working just fine.
[01:24:40.592 --> 01:24:42.534]  George Humphrey, my guest in studio.
[01:24:42.654 --> 01:24:51.441]  George, let's continue with the economic line you were going down with, with Renault, from the millions to the billions to the trillions to the quadrillions.
[01:24:53.503 --> 01:24:53.963]  Quadrillions.
[01:24:54.004 --> 01:25:05.613]  And actually, that word, quadrillions, first came up about eight or nine months ago when we were talking about the number of derivatives that are out in the system.
[01:25:06.414 --> 01:25:08.455]  A quadrillion!
[01:25:08.875 --> 01:25:12.797]  I mean, these are numbers that people can't even understand.
[01:25:13.137 --> 01:25:33.346]  A trillion dollars, just to put it in perspective, the day that Jesus, or Yeshua, was born, if you had a big kitty and put a thousand dollars in the kitty every single day, for every day of his life, through the time of the disciples, through the time of Rome, through the Dark Ages, into the Renaissance,
[01:25:34.617 --> 01:25:42.601]  Into the discovery of the West, into the colonization, into right now, $1,000 a day for the last 2,000 years, the total amount would be $670 billion.
[01:25:53.092 --> 01:25:54.413]  Not even a trillion dollars.
[01:25:54.893 --> 01:25:56.654]  That's how much money we're talking about.
[01:25:56.714 --> 01:25:59.256]  And a quadrillion is a thousand trillion.
[01:25:59.596 --> 01:26:00.857]  A thousand trillion.
[01:26:01.217 --> 01:26:13.184]  And they're not talking about... I mean, we would have financial guest on a year or two ago saying it's up to one and a half quadrillion, and then now we're seeing in mainstream news that the total derivatives may be two quadrillion.
[01:26:13.204 --> 01:26:14.265]  They're now using that term.
[01:26:14.745 --> 01:26:15.486]  And we don't know.
[01:26:15.506 --> 01:26:18.428]  I mean, the point is, is that anybody who says they do know,
[01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:33.932]  You know, is blowing smoke, because we don't know, because that information, but whether it is 50, you know, 50 trillion, or 100 trillion, or 500 trillion, or a quadrillion, it doesn't make any difference.
[01:26:34.332 --> 01:26:36.573]  You know, the bomb has already killed the patient.
[01:26:37.353 --> 01:26:38.074]  It's all gone.
[01:26:39.155 --> 01:26:41.937]  The system is broke.
[01:26:42.157 --> 01:26:54.366]  And until we go back to constitutional money, until we eliminate the Federal Reserve Board, until we have a hard currency, the situation is going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:26:54.907 --> 01:27:05.635]  And oh, about eight or nine years ago, when the Asian countries went down, is the United States went in there and they said, you've got to get rid of all of your toxic debts.
[01:27:06.738 --> 01:27:11.240]  And they kicked and screamed and they kicked and screamed but they finally got rid of their toxic debts.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:24.066]  They had two or three years and now the countries like Thailand and Vietnam and Indonesia are coming back up and they're coming stronger because they got rid of their toxic debts.
[01:27:24.766 --> 01:27:32.150]  Now 20 years ago when Japan went down, they didn't get rid of their toxic debts and they've had 20 years of recession.
[01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:43.579]  Right now, we're just feeding all this money, good money after bad, into these financial situations, and there is no way to stop the bleeding.
[01:27:43.899 --> 01:27:45.440]  There is no way to stop the bleeding.
[01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:53.327]  And unless we cut out the toxic debts, unless we take our medicine, unless we go back to constitutional money,
[01:27:54.625 --> 01:28:04.946]  It's just not going to happen unless we invest in productivity, unless we invest in sustainability, unless we invest in our people.
[01:28:06.075 --> 01:28:07.035]  It's not going to happen.
[01:28:07.355 --> 01:28:10.757]  And these are the choices that Alex is putting out to all of us.
[01:28:11.217 --> 01:28:18.979]  And now we have to become aware of it through this information war, and then share this information with our friends and families, and change the paradigm.
[01:28:19.079 --> 01:28:31.063]  Now George, when you look at what the globalists have done, they want us dependent, they want us domesticated, they want us institutionalized, and they say in their own documents, that's why they paid for decades for companies to leave the United States tax incentives.
[01:28:31.443 --> 01:28:33.044]  That's why they did everything they could
[01:28:33.684 --> 01:28:35.005]  And now you look at their stimulus.
[01:28:35.065 --> 01:28:42.709]  It's only to expand their power control and accelerate the debt while telling us on the news it's our fault we did it.
[01:28:42.749 --> 01:28:46.150]  And it is our fault in that we let the globalists carry this out.
[01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:51.613]  But that's like a kid who's five years old and didn't listen to mom and gets tricked into the back of a van and gets raped and tortured to death.
[01:28:52.333 --> 01:28:53.954]  Still, you don't blame the five-year-old.
[01:28:53.994 --> 01:28:55.675]  You blame the guy that kidnapped the child.
[01:28:55.695 --> 01:28:57.416]  And the kidnapper is the bankers.
[01:28:57.756 --> 01:28:58.997]  Oh, there's no question about it.
[01:28:59.157 --> 01:29:01.098]  And it's just not the bankers in New York.
[01:29:01.178 --> 01:29:02.959]  This has been an international cabal.
[01:29:03.599 --> 01:29:07.040]  Instituted by Adam Weishauf and the Rothschilds back in 1776.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.701]  And again, this is not conspiracy theory.
[01:29:10.761 --> 01:29:12.241]  This is just plain fact.
[01:29:12.701 --> 01:29:20.123]  They instituted, you know, the brains of Rothschild is to institute fiat currency.
[01:29:20.163 --> 01:29:22.244]  And he took over the Banque Nationale de Paris.
[01:29:22.284 --> 01:29:24.144]  He took over the Bank of England.
[01:29:24.224 --> 01:29:25.805]  He took over the Bank of Italy.
[01:29:25.825 --> 01:29:27.365]  They've taken over the city.
[01:29:27.385 --> 01:29:28.545]  They've taken over Chase.
[01:29:28.885 --> 01:29:31.206]  And they've taken over the full
[01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:34.547]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:34.567 --> 01:29:36.268]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.804 --> 01:30:04.646]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[01:30:04.846 --> 01:30:13.249]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:30:13.469 --> 01:30:18.150]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:25.193]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:31.655]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[01:30:31.835 --> 01:30:39.178]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins.
[01:30:39.298 --> 01:30:47.621]  With extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits, improve taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[01:30:47.781 --> 01:30:51.282]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[01:30:51.522 --> 01:30:55.026]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:30:55.307 --> 01:30:57.870]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:30:57.970 --> 01:31:06.019]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.042]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:09.193 --> 01:31:10.033]  Who is the enemy?
[01:31:10.554 --> 01:31:11.054]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:11.354 --> 01:31:12.374]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:12.394 --> 01:31:13.695]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:13.735 --> 01:31:15.375]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:15.715 --> 01:31:22.458]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:22.858 --> 01:31:23.298]  Some U.S.
[01:31:23.338 --> 01:31:28.980]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.183]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:33.203 --> 01:31:35.986]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:05.672]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:32:06.132 --> 01:32:09.094]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[01:32:09.494 --> 01:32:13.996]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[01:32:14.357 --> 01:32:18.979]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[01:32:19.525 --> 01:32:31.060]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[01:32:31.361 --> 01:32:34.205]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[01:32:34.665 --> 01:32:37.627]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:32:37.907 --> 01:32:40.908]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[01:32:41.228 --> 01:32:44.030]  Or go to my website at taxhelponline.com.
[01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:49.172]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[01:32:49.652 --> 01:32:50.393]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[01:32:50.633 --> 01:32:51.113]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:32:51.253 --> 01:32:52.434]  He's going the distance.
[01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:25.461]  Yeah!
[01:33:29.122 --> 01:33:30.303]  We are Backline.
[01:33:30.343 --> 01:33:31.323]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:35.104]  Gotta think of a few of our sponsors, then go right back to George Humphrey.
[01:33:36.104 --> 01:33:38.485]  Right here in studio with us today.
[01:33:42.406 --> 01:33:48.167]  Okay, I want to again just tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this transmission possible.
[01:33:49.928 --> 01:33:50.328]  One of them,
[01:33:51.997 --> 01:33:53.777]  It's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:33:53.797 --> 01:33:56.138]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:33:56.178 --> 01:33:57.999]  Hurricanes, snow, ice, storms.
[01:33:58.459 --> 01:34:01.559]  Lister should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:06.521]  A solar power generator is now available from our long-time sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:34:06.961 --> 01:34:11.022]  It's designed to provide 1800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[01:34:11.422 --> 01:34:19.104]  You've got an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity
[01:34:19.944 --> 01:34:26.507]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:34:26.987 --> 01:34:30.149]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:34:30.489 --> 01:34:32.690]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:36.652]  Check them out at MySolarBackup.com or the banner up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:36.932 --> 01:34:38.613]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[01:34:47.839 --> 01:34:49.815]  Another one of our fine sponsors.
[01:34:52.168 --> 01:34:56.452]  And I want folks to check out is survivalistseeds.com.
[01:34:56.772 --> 01:35:01.396]  Grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free from the New World Order.
[01:35:01.436 --> 01:35:08.281]  This family business buys in massive bucks and passes those huge discounts on to our listeners.
[01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:12.685]  15,000 heirloom seeds will provide you and your family with healthy food for seven years.
[01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:14.866]  Stop buying and eating New World Order food.
[01:35:15.287 --> 01:35:17.388]  Grow for your own family in your backyard.
[01:35:18.489 --> 01:35:19.850]  15,000 heirloom seeds.
[01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:22.930]  That's real food insurance for the difficult times we're already entering.
[01:35:23.311 --> 01:35:26.972]  Heirloom seeds are from the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[01:35:28.052 --> 01:35:30.153]  All their seeds date back over a century.
[01:35:30.653 --> 01:35:33.194]  Their Mayflower bean came over on the Mayflower ship.
[01:35:33.714 --> 01:35:43.837]  Now SurvivalistSeeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers and sell them back the seeds you've saved year after year, because demand is skyrocketing for the rare heirloom seeds.
[01:35:44.597 --> 01:35:49.661]  You also get a DVD teaching you how to sell your vegetable produce to restaurants, delis, and farmers markets.
[01:35:50.081 --> 01:35:54.825]  Slaves Hesitate, Patriots Take Action, survivalofseeds.com.
[01:35:55.386 --> 01:36:00.810]  And again, it's the sponsors that allow us to continue to operate, and I believe in all the sponsors I endorse here.
[01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:02.391]  So, survivalofseeds.com.
[01:36:02.731 --> 01:36:03.292]  Okay, George.
[01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:14.342]  First of all, I'd like to say thank you to your sponsors, because those companies... I have solar on my house, it provides about 30% of my power, and everybody has to be aware.
[01:36:14.563 --> 01:36:17.746]  You've got to start planting your victory gardens right now.
[01:36:18.847 --> 01:36:22.110]  Food is going to be the massive roadblock.
[01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:26.132]  And while you're out there planning it and enjoying it, you're meant to dig in the dirt and see earthworms.
[01:36:26.152 --> 01:36:26.533]  Absolutely.
[01:36:26.573 --> 01:36:27.833]  Your children just love it.
[01:36:27.853 --> 01:36:28.954]  They don't want to watch TV.
[01:36:28.974 --> 01:36:29.714]  Give them a chance.
[01:36:30.115 --> 01:36:35.458]  And then while you're planting and doing this, you'll get spiritually centered and think about how you're fighting the new world order.
[01:36:35.538 --> 01:36:38.420]  And it's the journey of a thousand miles starts with that single step.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:43.202]  In a very small space, if you do it right, you can grow a tremendous amount of food.
[01:36:43.723 --> 01:36:45.424]  So, just think about it.
[01:36:46.164 --> 01:36:47.106]  Get some solar.
[01:36:47.967 --> 01:36:50.411]  Get a car that gets at least 30 miles a gallon.
[01:36:50.932 --> 01:36:52.033]  Get a victory garden.
[01:36:52.234 --> 01:36:54.477]  Start becoming sustainable right now.
[01:36:54.577 --> 01:36:56.781]  And that's real sustainable, not their counterfeit sustainable.
[01:36:56.801 --> 01:36:57.041]  Right.
[01:36:57.502 --> 01:36:58.283]  Which they mean control.
[01:36:58.323 --> 01:37:00.367]  Now George, let's get into
[01:37:01.508 --> 01:37:02.028]  Obama.
[01:37:02.868 --> 01:37:16.793]  I mean, if you were standing before a group of well-meaning Obama people that knew Bush was bad and evil, the torture, the secret arrest, the wars, and then the media craftily, the same media that put him in power,
[01:37:17.593 --> 01:37:24.818]  Transmuted all the hatred of Bush onto love of Obama, and then now he's completely already, just a month in office, betrayed all that.
[01:37:25.359 --> 01:37:35.806]  Lay out as if, you know, you're speaking to a lot of them, but directly to them, they're watching this online, they're listening to this on the radio, they're seeing this a month from now, when he's done even more horrible things, versus the rhetoric.
[01:37:36.046 --> 01:37:38.528]  They have the phony right wing attacking to make the left offending.
[01:37:38.548 --> 01:37:39.829]  You know, they have all these tricks.
[01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:47.367]  But, breakdown as an economist, as a former city council member, as an author, a researcher, what you see happening with Obama.
[01:37:47.759 --> 01:37:54.825]  Well, this is not a theoretical discussion because I had this discussion just a couple days ago with some very, very dear friends of mine.
[01:37:55.526 --> 01:37:59.149]  Very well educated, they love this country, they're learning about things.
[01:37:59.889 --> 01:38:05.154]  They were very, you know, and they come from very highly educated families and they've done a lot of things.
[01:38:05.634 --> 01:38:09.717]  And they were so opposed to what Bush was doing
[01:38:10.615 --> 01:38:12.777]  That they, and then they see Obama.
[01:38:13.197 --> 01:38:22.705]  Quite clearly, Brother Obama is one of the most articulate, intelligent, and charismatic figures ever to come in front of the American people.
[01:38:23.166 --> 01:38:30.572]  And I applaud the leaders, the Illuminati or the power leader, whatever you want to call these rascals, for creating this character.
[01:38:30.592 --> 01:38:32.613]  I mean, you know, he is the perfect
[01:38:33.294 --> 01:38:34.595]  I don't
[01:38:55.219 --> 01:38:57.119]  To me is step number one.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:06.762]  And Obama, when he first came out, he got a lot of support from the left wing because he was supposedly opposed to the wars in the Middle East.
[01:39:07.262 --> 01:39:08.982]  He voted against the war in Iraq.
[01:39:09.042 --> 01:39:11.403]  He's talked about Afghanistan.
[01:39:12.483 --> 01:39:14.484]  He said we're going to get out of the Middle East.
[01:39:14.564 --> 01:39:15.984]  We're going to be out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:39:20.868 --> 01:39:25.771]  He talked to us about change and transparency, something that we all want.
[01:39:26.451 --> 01:39:30.714]  He said that he would work for the environment.
[01:39:31.454 --> 01:39:35.417]  He said that he would work to clean up this financial disaster.
[01:39:36.137 --> 01:39:42.081]  He would work to help us get better education and health care for the people of this country.
[01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:53.459]  Now, the son of a gun went, you know, and again, knowing everything that I knew, and I knew where his money was coming from, but I listened and I listened and I listened.
[01:39:54.139 --> 01:39:55.440]  But within one month,
[01:39:57.028 --> 01:40:01.751]  He is absolutely, completely betrayed.
[01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:03.773]  100% betrayed the American people.
[01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:17.743]  And quite, quite clearly, Brother Obama is the most fancy, the most decorated, the most expensive Trojan horse in the history of Western culture.
[01:40:19.036 --> 01:40:20.257]  This guy's amazing.
[01:40:20.717 --> 01:40:29.063]  So let's just take a look at his appointments because you can always tell a person by the company he surrounds himself with.
[01:40:29.464 --> 01:40:32.106]  He said he was going to get us out of the war in Iraq.
[01:40:34.227 --> 01:40:42.737]  He reappointed Bill Gates, one of the architects of the war, a guy who's a member of the CFR and a Bilderberger, and the guy who is a hardline hawk.
[01:40:43.278 --> 01:40:50.286]  He's already broken his promise about getting troops out of Iraq, and he is for more war.
[01:40:53.041 --> 01:41:04.594]  And in sending more troops to Afghanistan, he is foreputting nuclear weapons in Poland and the Ukraine and Georgia aimed at Russia.
[01:41:05.014 --> 01:41:08.858]  Now this is a part of the puzzle that's never talked about.
[01:41:09.399 --> 01:41:11.201]  And I'm not pro-Russian, you know.
[01:41:11.821 --> 01:41:24.165]  But, I can understand why the Russians have a burr under their saddle, because if the Russians were pointing nuclear weapons at us, we would be very upset.
[01:41:24.705 --> 01:41:31.408]  And Obama is supporting putting short-term, intermediate-range,
[01:41:32.328 --> 01:41:38.751]  Nuclear missiles pointed at Moscow in the Ukraine, in Poland, and in Georgia.
[01:41:39.111 --> 01:41:43.754]  This is an act of war, my friends, and this man is not a man of peace.
[01:41:44.634 --> 01:41:49.977]  His director, his Justice Department man, Eric Holder.
[01:41:50.717 --> 01:41:59.902]  Now, the Second Amendment was put number two very, very clearly by our Founding Fathers because they wanted us to be free.
[01:42:01.022 --> 01:42:07.128]  And the Second Amendment is about us, we, the citizens of this country defending themselves.
[01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:16.958]  Eric Holder is on record saying that the Second Amendment was only intended for the military.
[01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:24.105]  Obama clearly is first going to go after the ammunition, and then he's going to go after the weapons.
[01:42:25.518 --> 01:42:28.601]  And these weapons are what keeps us free.
[01:42:28.621 --> 01:42:37.471]  I am, you know, my mentor, my biggest, the person I read more about than anybody else is Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:42:37.631 --> 01:42:40.173]  I go to India every year, I believe in Satra Gaha.
[01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:48.182]  And even Gandhi said, it is better to join the army and die fighting for your country than to be a coward.
[01:42:49.682 --> 01:42:54.067]  And I don't think that we, clearly we don't want to go into violence right now.
[01:42:54.127 --> 01:42:55.928]  That would play in the hands of the power elite.
[01:42:56.489 --> 01:42:57.970]  But we can't lie down to this.
[01:42:58.051 --> 01:43:00.353]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[01:43:00.493 --> 01:43:04.697]  It's the willingness to fight back that keeps the enemy from going for the full move.
[01:43:05.017 --> 01:43:10.343]  Because they know there's a large contingent of people, I would say at least 10 million, who are ready to go.
[01:43:10.583 --> 01:43:19.930]  And what's really beautiful is that in the gun stores all across the country, gun sales are up between 75 to 150 percent in the last three months.
[01:43:20.311 --> 01:43:31.440]  People of this country, good people of this country, people who are not violent, people who believe in the Republic, people who believe in the rule of law, realize that they need to arm themselves.
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:36.141]  And so, you know, again, none of us are advocating violence.
[01:43:36.202 --> 01:43:45.925]  What we are advocating is the protection of our Bill of Rights, the protection of our Republic, the protection of the rule of law, and the protection of our families and our culture.
[01:43:45.945 --> 01:43:53.848]  Well, George, they're building FEMA camps, they're militarizing the police, they are building an army against us, and we have to defend ourselves.
[01:43:54.068 --> 01:43:54.928]  Well, absolutely.
[01:43:55.108 --> 01:43:56.229]  And, you know, and
[01:43:57.535 --> 01:44:04.619]  And the reason that we're on radio and television and writing books right now is so it doesn't come to that.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:15.646]  And if you, if your friends, if your family, if your acquaintances, if the people in the grocery stores become aware of this and stand up and say no, it doesn't have to come to this.
[01:44:15.906 --> 01:44:17.047]  The choice is right now.
[01:44:17.427 --> 01:44:21.430]  Either we can stand up and protect this country right now, or it's going to come to this.
[01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:22.450]  No, no.
[01:44:37.185 --> 01:44:39.027]  He is a true work of art.
[01:44:39.587 --> 01:44:46.693]  He was the head of the Federal Reserve in New York, which is the most powerful of the branch banks.
[01:44:47.194 --> 01:44:48.495]  He worked at the Treasury.
[01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:53.900]  He is close, close, close with Paulson, who, in my mind, is an economic Nazi.
[01:44:54.761 --> 01:45:04.049]  He worked at the IMF, but he was also not just a member of, but a paid employee of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:45:05.885 --> 01:45:12.296]  You talk about, you know, saying the fox has been hired to guard the hen house is such a lame analogy.
[01:45:12.597 --> 01:45:13.678]  We're talking about
[01:45:15.822 --> 01:45:22.466]  The criminals, criminals, who created this situation, Paulson, Gettner, Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[01:45:22.506 --> 01:45:28.430]  Morgan, Citibank, Chase, the whole group of them, with the epicenter at Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:36.735]  Morgan, who created the structured investment vehicles, who created this toxic waste, who created these derivatives, who made
[01:45:37.859 --> 01:45:50.474]  millions and billions in some cases trillions on the way up looting the american treasuries looting the value of this country are now making even more on the way down and this guy
[01:45:51.903 --> 01:45:55.705]  The fact that there is not more outrage about this is just amazing.
[01:45:56.145 --> 01:45:58.646]  Number four, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:59.246 --> 01:46:01.107]  Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State.
[01:46:01.747 --> 01:46:11.472]  And I remember 15, 16 years ago I was writing a book called Common Sense and one of the chapters was about the Clintons and I went up to
[01:46:12.752 --> 01:46:17.859]  I've heard a lot of rumors about what the Clintons had done in Mena, Arkansas.
[01:46:17.899 --> 01:46:25.528]  I know that Alex has talked about Mena, Arkansas hundreds of times here, and I just didn't believe that
[01:46:26.886 --> 01:46:31.551]  The shenanigans, not shenanigans, because it's not shenanigans, it's cold-blooded murder.
[01:46:31.591 --> 01:46:32.653]  A lot of it's on record.
[01:46:32.713 --> 01:46:40.541]  Yeah, it's absolutely on record, is that there are 90, and you can look this up on the web, there are 93 people
[01:46:43.985 --> 01:46:56.752]  Back in the 80s and the 90s, who were all in their teens, 20s, 30s, and 40s, who all died violent deaths, and their only common denominator was their connection with Clinton's.
[01:46:57.713 --> 01:47:03.056]  Now the potential for this not to be connected is four and a half billion to one.
[01:47:04.375 --> 01:47:08.278]  And Hillary Clinton, yeah, she's very intelligent, she's hard-working.
[01:47:08.318 --> 01:47:09.439]  Yeah, but how has this changed?
[01:47:09.479 --> 01:47:10.799]  He promised change.
[01:47:10.839 --> 01:47:12.861]  He brought in all the old Bush and Clinton guard.
[01:47:12.941 --> 01:47:16.523]  Yeah, you know, he promised no lobbyists.
[01:47:16.603 --> 01:47:22.807]  He promised change every single one of his appointments.
[01:47:23.188 --> 01:47:25.349]  The only change is the change in the names.
[01:47:25.749 --> 01:47:28.151]  They're all members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:47:28.511 --> 01:47:30.192]  Most of them are members of the Bilderberg.
[01:47:30.553 --> 01:47:32.774]  They are all the status quo from the 1990s.
[01:47:35.035 --> 01:47:53.982]  And folks, if you can't see this, no matter how handsome he is, no matter how sweetly he speaks, no matter how much good rock and roll music there is, and I would have loved to have gone to the inauguration because I love Shakira and I love Bruce Springsteen and I love all that stuff.
[01:47:56.263 --> 01:47:57.344]  But it's just stuff.
[01:47:57.684 --> 01:48:00.026]  Words and actions are what's important.
[01:48:00.826 --> 01:48:08.112]  Then we go down to Homeland Security, and Janet Napolitano.
[01:48:08.612 --> 01:48:09.433]  Another lobbyist.
[01:48:09.453 --> 01:48:15.537]  He doesn't appoint anyone that isn't a lobbyist, and it's like 20, 30, 40 people deep in the command structure.
[01:48:15.777 --> 01:48:17.719]  This is the lobbyist administration.
[01:48:17.759 --> 01:48:20.561]  Yes, and then you have the head of the CIA, Lou Panetta.
[01:48:20.721 --> 01:48:21.321]  Leon Panetta.
[01:48:25.164 --> 01:48:29.308]  I mean, he is the biggest and he's rated as the biggest Wall Street lobbyist in the world.
[01:48:29.328 --> 01:48:32.670]  Yeah, I mean, you know, what the heck is this guy doing head of the CIA?
[01:48:33.171 --> 01:48:39.836]  But the CIA and the Pentagon and the Treasury and the IMF are all one organization.
[01:48:40.337 --> 01:48:43.459]  These folks are the power elite mafia.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:46.742]  Democrat, Republican,
[01:48:47.577 --> 01:48:49.038]  They're all mafia up there.
[01:48:49.078 --> 01:48:54.181]  If you can't look at Joe Biden and see that he's a mafia don, then you're not paying attention.
[01:48:54.602 --> 01:49:05.109]  Now, the one appointment that gets under my skin, perhaps more than anybody else, is the fellow who walks around at his right hand hip 24-7.
[01:49:05.129 --> 01:49:12.974]  The guy who is in his room at 6 in the morning and who stays with him until 11 o'clock at night.
[01:49:13.014 --> 01:49:13.715]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:49:13.855 --> 01:49:15.216]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:49:16.215 --> 01:49:20.257]  Folks, if you don't know about Brother Rahm Emanuel, guy is, he's brilliant.
[01:49:20.317 --> 01:49:23.239]  He went to Nutrier High School up in North Chicago.
[01:49:23.299 --> 01:49:26.021]  He's absolutely a brilliant guy.
[01:49:26.361 --> 01:49:29.443]  He's hard, he's a hard worker.
[01:49:30.103 --> 01:49:32.364]  There's, you know, and he knows the political ranks.
[01:49:33.065 --> 01:49:36.047]  His father was a pay, was an assassin.
[01:49:37.403 --> 01:49:41.406]  Before Israel was a country, he would kill British and voice.
[01:49:41.506 --> 01:49:42.888]  Not just Palestinians.
[01:49:43.508 --> 01:49:45.009]  He wouldn't just kill Palestinians.
[01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:46.470]  He would kill Brits.
[01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:50.454]  And not that one is more valuable, you know, a Brit is not more valuable.
[01:49:50.474 --> 01:49:52.435]  Well, he was one of the heads of the Aragon Territories.
[01:49:52.555 --> 01:49:53.416]  Absolutely he is.
[01:49:53.817 --> 01:49:58.180]  Most of Rahm Emanuel's family has dual citizenship with Israel.
[01:49:58.901 --> 01:50:02.604]  He is the political Zionist Zionist.
[01:50:04.105 --> 01:50:07.269]  And a lot of people don't know what political Zionism is.
[01:50:07.349 --> 01:50:09.752]  It's not about anti-Semitism.
[01:50:09.832 --> 01:50:11.294]  It's not about being Jewish.
[01:50:11.694 --> 01:50:13.336]  It's not about anything like that.
[01:50:13.917 --> 01:50:19.684]  It is a group of people who believe that they are the chosen ones and who have this false persona
[01:50:20.385 --> 01:50:27.233]  And who have absolute total control of the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, and what's going on.
[01:50:27.613 --> 01:50:30.937]  Rahm Emanuel, right now, wants to nuke Iran.
[01:50:31.057 --> 01:50:34.961]  Not just the military bases, he wants to nuke Tehran.
[01:50:35.121 --> 01:50:39.066]  And he wants compulsory national service, on record for us to be government slaves.
[01:50:39.126 --> 01:50:39.446]  Stay there.
[01:50:39.506 --> 01:50:40.267]  Final segment, George.
[01:50:40.407 --> 01:50:40.507]  Okay.
[01:50:40.527 --> 01:50:52.623]  We're going to interview you after the show for the film, and probably use some of this for the film, so we can get to go back over all this again as we get off, and more, but to try to go through all the... I mean, you've got the Deputy Secretary of Defense was the top Raytheon lobbyist.
[01:50:53.484 --> 01:50:56.047]  He's continuing the torture, blocked the British from stopping it.
[01:50:56.207 --> 01:50:56.888]  Yep.
[01:50:56.968 --> 01:50:58.130]  He just lies about everything.
[01:50:59.264 --> 01:51:07.615]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[01:51:07.735 --> 01:51:14.224]  Nutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist
[01:51:14.264 --> 01:51:14.964]  We're good to go!
[01:51:43.359 --> 01:51:43.539]  Yes.
[01:51:59.548 --> 01:52:02.089]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:52:02.409 --> 01:52:03.689]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:52:03.969 --> 01:52:05.969]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:07.870]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:09.270]  The late great USA.
[01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:10.911]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:52:58.895 --> 01:53:01.976]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?

[01:53:06.178 --> 01:53:12.119]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.780]  These emergency backup systems
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.120]  We're good.
[01:53:32.362 --> 01:53:32.723]  I think?
[01:54:09.468 --> 01:54:10.109]  You got one life.
[01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:12.751]  Are you going to be slaves or are you going to fight tyranny?
[01:54:13.231 --> 01:54:16.714]  Are you going to live up a little bit to your ancestors' standard?
[01:54:16.734 --> 01:54:18.515]  Or are you going to be way down below it?
[01:54:21.038 --> 01:54:25.561]  Yeah, we're taking fight!
[01:54:25.902 --> 01:54:27.183]  We're never going to give it up!
[01:54:28.364 --> 01:54:29.805]  We're standing tall!
[01:54:30.746 --> 01:54:32.767]  We're getting up there in the catapult!
[01:54:33.768 --> 01:54:34.369]  Ha ha!
[01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:38.562]  Yeah, Alex, you are so cool.
[01:54:39.062 --> 01:54:40.864]  Hey, man, you gotta get fired up!
[01:54:41.024 --> 01:54:41.804]  You do, man.
[01:54:41.864 --> 01:54:43.505]  It's exciting fighting this tyranny.
[01:54:43.986 --> 01:54:45.506]  You know, it's really... Really being alive.
[01:54:46.487 --> 01:54:48.008]  This is where the action is.
[01:54:48.288 --> 01:55:01.656]  Where else, what other thing can you talk about except about freedom, the protection of your country, the protection of your family, the stopping of these pirates, and then you make all these great new friends...
[01:55:02.717 --> 01:55:07.199]  And then it opens you up to all sorts of different concepts.
[01:55:07.899 --> 01:55:10.280]  And this is what's called the First Awakening.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:19.443]  The awareness that the whole political and economic structure is totally manipulated and that there are pirates in control of the ship.
[01:55:20.263 --> 01:55:26.767]  And then, so, we learn about ways to deal with this, and then, is the spiritual aspect of this.
[01:55:26.887 --> 01:55:31.810]  Because, quite clearly, they've got more guns, they've got more money, they've got more soldiers.
[01:55:31.890 --> 01:55:32.991]  Now, we're growing.
[01:55:33.031 --> 01:55:34.632]  But they admit 90% of the fight is the mind.
[01:55:34.672 --> 01:55:35.112]  Absolutely.
[01:55:35.192 --> 01:55:37.214]  If we just refuse to get outside the box...
[01:55:37.694 --> 01:55:41.338]  Folks, you don't have to defeat the whole New World Order yourself in ten seconds.
[01:55:41.699 --> 01:55:43.381]  It's deciding you're not with it.
[01:55:43.421 --> 01:55:44.482]  It's a spiritual decision.
[01:55:44.622 --> 01:55:45.203]  Absolutely.
[01:55:45.383 --> 01:55:49.608]  It is a spiritual, psychological, mental decision.
[01:55:49.928 --> 01:55:51.770]  It is the law of intention.
[01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:56.916]  And if each one of us become aware of our own power,
[01:55:57.657 --> 01:56:00.580]  And the fact that God does not make junk.
[01:56:01.101 --> 01:56:02.222]  God doesn't make junk.
[01:56:02.823 --> 01:56:05.666]  Yeshua, Jesus, talked about taking control.
[01:56:05.706 --> 01:56:07.808]  He said, you'll do greater miracles than I will.
[01:56:08.309 --> 01:56:10.511]  Be people of peace, but be strong.
[01:56:11.012 --> 01:56:19.080]  And be aware that through the law of intention, the law of creation, the law of allowance, and the law of harmony,
[01:56:19.841 --> 01:56:23.242]  Is that we can create whatever type of world we want.
[01:56:23.522 --> 01:56:31.584]  Now, quite clearly, the wizards of the Illuminati, who are very, very advanced people, know about these universal laws.
[01:56:31.925 --> 01:56:41.027]  And they have been manipulating us through our food, through the chemtrails, through our education, through our media, to make us feel that we are victims.
[01:56:41.147 --> 01:56:42.988]  To make us feel that we are weak.
[01:56:43.008 --> 01:56:43.788]  To make us feel weak!
[01:56:44.008 --> 01:56:44.268]  Yes.
[01:56:44.428 --> 01:56:48.230]  But if you know you're under attack, you can actually use that attack to make yourself even stronger.
[01:56:48.390 --> 01:57:00.537]  Well, that's the first thing, is to get some power in your heart, to bring up that fire, but to also understand that this is going to be more like to win.
[01:57:00.897 --> 01:57:02.318]  And I'm here to win this thing.
[01:57:02.398 --> 01:57:03.458]  More like jiu-jitsu?
[01:57:03.538 --> 01:57:04.479]  Not to be a martyr.
[01:57:06.678 --> 01:57:18.745]  But, you know, if we go head-to-head with them right now, they're pretty tough, but it's like an Aikido match, and we're going to use their power, just like Cassius Clay or Muhammad Ali did the rope-a-dope against Foreman.
[01:57:19.485 --> 01:57:24.888]  We let them use their power for them to dissipate their power.
[01:57:24.908 --> 01:57:28.591]  9-11, as horrible and as tragic as it was, was a total failure for them.
[01:57:31.172 --> 01:57:36.534]  And it allowed us, people like you and I and many others, to get the message out.
[01:57:36.614 --> 01:57:38.315]  And at first, we were derided.
[01:57:39.255 --> 01:57:40.056]  People would laugh at us.
[01:57:40.096 --> 01:57:41.456]  But we were willing to commit.
[01:57:41.496 --> 01:57:43.537]  You know, I lost most of my affiliates when I did that.
[01:57:43.977 --> 01:57:44.857]  And we built them back up.
[01:57:44.898 --> 01:57:47.078]  Now that I'm bashing Obama, some affiliates are dropping.
[01:57:47.479 --> 01:57:48.359]  I could care less.
[01:57:48.839 --> 01:57:55.402]  It's about the truth and never compromising and knowing that we'll reach even more down the road when it's proven that we were right.
[01:57:55.442 --> 01:57:58.063]  George Humphrey, we're going to do an interview here now after the show.
[01:57:58.903 --> 01:57:59.744]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[01:57:59.784 --> 01:58:03.326]  We had two state reps on today from New Hampshire.
[01:58:03.447 --> 01:58:04.187]  Very powerful.
[01:58:04.227 --> 01:58:05.468]  We had Bob Chapman on.
[01:58:05.588 --> 01:58:11.653]  I covered this amazing, is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago?
[01:58:11.693 --> 01:58:13.394]  I covered that at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:58:13.754 --> 01:58:14.995]  At the start, I got into
[01:58:15.916 --> 01:58:21.261]  Now, they're coming into everybody's houses in Austin and businesses and putting in remote control thermostats.
[01:58:21.681 --> 01:58:24.504]  You gotta say no to them coming in your house and doing this, folks.
[01:58:24.524 --> 01:58:25.665]  They got the same thing in California.
[01:58:25.705 --> 01:58:29.568]  So that's coming up in the retransmission right now at OnePlaceInfoWars.com.
[01:58:29.829 --> 01:58:32.291]  See you back this Sunday with guests on the Chicago camps.
[01:58:32.311 --> 01:58:33.952]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:33.972 --> 01:58:34.613]  George, thank you.
[01:58:35.133 --> 01:58:35.494]  Hey, brother.
[01:58:37.596 --> 01:58:37.956]  That's it.
[01:58:38.116 --> 01:58:39.017]  Transmission starts now.
[01:58:40.498 --> 01:58:42.260]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.277 --> 01:58:47.458]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.579 --> 01:58:50.160]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:51.140]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:55.863]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:56.003 --> 01:58:58.765]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:01.846]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:02.006 --> 01:59:06.729]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:06.969 --> 01:59:07.870]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:08.091 --> 01:59:11.035]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:11.335 --> 01:59:18.244]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:18.324 --> 01:59:21.468]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
