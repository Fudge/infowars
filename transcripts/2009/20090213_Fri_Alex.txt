[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.823]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:11.424]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:12.985]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:17.167]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.210]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:30.944]  What's happening is the ambient background noise of tyranny is just being incrementally turned up.
[00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:34.006]  But now they're turning it up faster and faster.
[00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:38.310]  The other classic analogy is you have a pot of cold water.
[00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:46.297]  If you put a frog in it, it'll sit there happily, believing it's safe in the water from you walking around the stove.
[00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:51.882]  And if you turn the heat up on low, if it slowly heats up,
[00:00:53.749 --> 00:01:00.192]  And I've talked to folks in Louisiana, Mississippi that eat frogs, actually had frogs legs, that it's really true.
[00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:11.216]  If you put a bullfrog or something else in a pot of water and slowly turn it up, that it will sit there until it dies.
[00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:16.806]  And I'm even being conditioned to accept this.
[00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:28.199]  I see articles every few days about how they're trying to make elderly and prisoners and government officials and military take microchips, not just in the United States but all over the world, and I don't even cover them!
[00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.194]  And the psych warfare chiefs know that.
[00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:47.385]  They know that back ten, twelve, thirteen years ago, when it was just in government documents, we would freak out and say, wow, look, they're planning to do this, and here's how they're going to push it through fads and security and all these other ways, and people would laugh at us.
[00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:55.831]  But now that it's just on the news for the last seven, eight years, constantly, it's kind of like, oh yeah, and the head of Sega says we'll all be getting chips.
[00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:56.712]  You want to play the game?
[00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:57.973]  You're going to take a chip.
[00:01:57.973 --> 00:01:58.773]  Oh yeah!
[00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:04.419]  You know, I play a bunch of video games where you're augmented with chips.
[00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:08.583]  See, they think because they play a video game that means that it's the same as being augmented with chips.
[00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:14.529]  We've all seen The Matrix.
[00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.572]  And now I just look at the news headlines on Infowars.com.
[00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:22.977]  Right before I went live I was looking at them and I was going, they're going to charge us per flush of the toilet?
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.183]  With government smart monitors on the toilets?
[00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:46.297]  And if you don't think that that's not going to happen, I remember three years ago reading about some cities in California making residents take smart thermostats in their house.
[00:02:46.297 --> 00:02:47.078]  And then guess what?
[00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:53.899]  Tim, who works here in the office, walks up to me and says, hey, this just came in the mail.
[00:02:53.899 --> 00:03:00.526]  City of Austin is coming next week to the office to put in remote control thermostats.
[00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:03.608]  And it said, you know, smart thermostats on the flyer.
[00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:08.233]  And I went and looked it up on the City of Austin.
[00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:09.194]  And sure enough,
[00:03:10.393 --> 00:03:12.594]  They're going to control the thermostat in my office.
[00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:17.818]  And it says, oh, if there's a power shortage or something, they'll just go ahead and, you know, turn things off.
[00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:28.044]  And they already admit in Europe and Canada and California, where they've implemented this, that they just, when they feel like it, say, oh, you don't need to have your office 76.
[00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:28.765]  We're going to set it at 80.
[00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:42.274]  And oh, you don't get health care once you're 55, then you have to go ahead and go blind or die of liver disease or not get that brain surgery.
[00:03:42.274 --> 00:03:44.136]  That is in the new bill.
[00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:46.397]  Tom Daschle that authored it wrote that in a book.
[00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:50.600]  I mean, it's not us saying this, they're saying it.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.983]  A decade ago they would deny that, now they just admit it.
[00:03:54.983 --> 00:03:57.205]  Total micromanagement, total control.
[00:03:59.258 --> 00:04:07.424]  Over every little facet of our lives, shutting down the farms and ranches, regulating everything.
[00:04:07.424 --> 00:04:10.726]  And the examples go on and on and on and on.
[00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:20.333]  I'll tell you about all the informative guests we've got coming up after the break.
[00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:26.457]  And then we'll get into, is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago from the Daily Newscaster?
[00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:27.988]  D.H.
[00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:30.391]  Williams, I want to get him on.
[00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:36.017]  I know this is a true report because everything in it checks out with what I've already researched.
[00:04:36.017 --> 00:04:39.901]  And there's a mass graves comment in here.
[00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:43.004]  So we'll go over that.
[00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:45.587]  Obama's Energy Secretary says get ready for the carbon tax.
[00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:48.368]  It's in the New York Times.
[00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:54.053]  All these years they said there's no plan for carbon tax and now it's like, of course we're gonna tax everything you do.
[00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.054]  You're not against Obama, are you?
[00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:57.355]  You're not a racist.
[00:04:57.355 --> 00:05:00.878]  I mean, come on.
[00:05:00.878 --> 00:05:03.460]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:07.428]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:05:07.428 --> 00:05:11.211]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:17.796]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:23.020]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.726]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:30.927]  Need something more?
[00:05:30.927 --> 00:05:35.070]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:43.377]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:49.062]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:05:49.062 --> 00:05:50.984]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:51.744]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:09.259]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.939]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:27.127]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR... The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:33.290]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening is taking place.
[00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.371]  An inside job...
[00:06:35.803 --> 00:06:37.044]  How dare you?
[00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:43.307]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:46.208]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:52.671]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:06:57.774 --> 00:07:00.255]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:04.173]  Time is more precious than money.
[00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:05.574]  You could be running out of time.
[00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:08.277]  I want to share something with you about your body.
[00:07:08.277 --> 00:07:10.079]  Quote, make no mistake about it.
[00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.183]  Parasites are the most toxic agents in the human body.
[00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:19.449]  They are one of the primary underlying causes of diseases and are the most basic cause of a compromised immune system.
[00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.292]  Dr. Hazel Parcells, PhD.
[00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:25.376]  Quote, we have a tremendous parasite problem right here in the U.S.
[00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:27.858]  It is just not being addressed.
[00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:34.845]  Dr. Peter Wyna, quote, in terms of numbers, there are more parasitic infections acquired in this country than in Africa.
[00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:39.870]  Dr. Frank Nova, Chief of the Laboratory for Parasitic Diseases of the National Institute of Health.
[00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.593]  As you can see, parasites are more dangerous than you think.
[00:07:42.593 --> 00:07:45.216]  For about a buck a day, you can rid yourself of all parasites.

[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.801]  And P.S.
[00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:02.202]  I, uh, I really like it.
[00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:08.824]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:11.805]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:35.821]  I had that flyer here on my desk we got two days ago and I must have, I'm trying to clean my desk off every day.
[00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:37.982]  I can't find it.
[00:08:37.982 --> 00:08:46.704]  Maybe we can go to one of the next door businesses and ask for theirs where it told me we're getting the new smart thermostats in the office and most of the homes in Austin have been getting the
[00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:52.088]  The flyer telling them this, and it's remote controlled.
[00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:58.874]  They read it via radio waves remotely, and they control the thermostat in your office or home.
[00:08:58.874 --> 00:09:06.000]  So we printed up during the break a January 12th article out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.825]  It says, Critics Cool to Smart Thermostat Proposal.
[00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:15.327]  Oh, the critics, they're for it now.
[00:09:15.327 --> 00:09:18.050]  Well, here in Texas, they just don't tell you they're going to remote control.
[00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:22.688]  Your thermostat, they just put them in.
[00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:24.169]  See, that's how this is done.
[00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:34.175]  New thermostats in homes and businesses would be fitted with technology that would allow utilities to change a building's temperature by remote control under a proposal being considered by state energy officials.
[00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:39.438]  See, in California three years ago was when they started phasing in these thermostats.
[00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:41.579]  They don't ask you.
[00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:46.863]  They just say, we're going to come in and wire your
[00:09:49.147 --> 00:09:53.250]  Air conditioning system, your heating system, into this.
[00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.214]  Can you believe this?
[00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:11.005]  Yet after public outcry by critics worried about Big Brother dictating home temperatures, officials with the California Energy Commission said this week that they will change the proposal regulations so that customers would have the option of blocking outside control of their thermostats.
[00:10:11.005 --> 00:10:13.867]  Yeah, right.
[00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:14.167]  Sure.
[00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:19.057]  Just let us put it in and everything will be alright.
[00:10:19.057 --> 00:10:26.141]  The new smart thermostat, supporters said, could help ease summertime power emergencies by allowing officials to limit the use of air conditioning.
[00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:27.922]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:28.383]  Remember
[00:10:30.177 --> 00:10:36.223]  Six, seven years ago, when they got Schwarzenegger in, they said Governor Gray Davis was involved with Enron running scams.
[00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:38.305]  He was a gun grabber.
[00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.047]  I got behind the recall.
[00:10:40.047 --> 00:10:43.010]  And then they baited and switched us and didn't put in a real conservative.
[00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.454]  They put in Schwarzenegger, the gun-grabbing, open borders, New World Order individual.
[00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:53.745]  And the news said that he was fighting Enron.
[00:10:53.745 --> 00:10:57.248]  Turned out he was involved in the meetings before he was even governor.
[00:10:57.248 --> 00:10:59.569]  And of course it was Gray Davis fighting Enron.
[00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:08.216]  And it turned out Enron would charge billions and billions of dollars a week in fake charges claiming the energy just cost that much.
[00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:11.278]  And they had fake trading computers and fake trading boards.
[00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:13.200]  This came out just ripping people off.
[00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:27.327]  And their internal memos came out that, well, if we turn the power off a few hours a day, that'll create the perception that there really is a shortage and people will put up with the tripling of their rates.
[00:11:27.327 --> 00:11:31.172]  Tripling!
[00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:33.114]  And so now, they'll just control
[00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.192]  Again, the government will control how hot or cold your house is.
[00:11:39.192 --> 00:11:50.156]  In Europe, they're banning fireplaces, putting taxes on them, restricting them, banning outdoor gas heaters at restaurants and bars, banning their sale, banning their importation.
[00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:53.646]  See, they tell you what type of light bulb you can have.
[00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.687]  They tell you what type of toilet you can have.
[00:11:55.687 --> 00:12:00.691]  They tell you what type of propellant you can have in your spray bottles.
[00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:05.034]  It all sounds reasonable, but then it's setting the precedent for total control.
[00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:13.020]  And then they go to the level of, oh, we're going to remote control your car.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.842]  We're going to remote control your house.
[00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:20.030]  We're going to look at all the prescriptions you get instantly with no warrant.
[00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:27.395]  It just is all uploaded to the government.
[00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:37.163]  And then now they're announcing that if elderly people get Medicare or Medicaid, they want to put in their refrigerators a smart system where they have to scan in
[00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:59.983]  Then it'll all be automated with RFIDs, soon little tracker chips, everything you're eating and doing, and then scanners will be in the house to make sure that you are eating enough food and that you're taking care of yourself, and that will be remotely monitored by the threat integration centers in the counties.
[00:12:59.983 --> 00:13:01.363]  Total big brother!
[00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:09.825]  Worse than THX 1138, worse than Brave New World, worse than 1984, and it's all just being set up around us.
[00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:26.950]  So when you hear Barack Obama talk about we're going to have energy standards and we're going to build the new green economy, it has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:34.254]  It's all to do with total and complete, absolute control in micromanagement.
[00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:37.045]  San Francisco Chronicle continues.
[00:13:37.045 --> 00:13:51.570]  The special thermostats, which allow utilities to adjust air conditioning in homes and businesses via radio signals, are meant to be used only during emergencies, of course, as a way of avoiding costly and damaging blackouts, when California's been caught running scams, cheating people.
[00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:58.952]  Chandler said she noted that several of the state's utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric Co., already operate similar voluntary programs in some areas.
[00:14:01.018 --> 00:14:09.464]  Folks, we all have to start putting in at least supplemental solar to get around these people micromanaging us and controlling us.
[00:14:09.464 --> 00:14:20.653]  You know, they put controllers on the boxes in Michigan and other states on how much energy people can use and people are dying.
[00:14:20.653 --> 00:14:26.117]  Folks are found, poor people are found by the hundreds.
[00:14:26.117 --> 00:14:28.119]  I mean, I saw a report last week that hundreds had died.
[00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:31.208]  Just frozen to death in their beds.
[00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:34.976]  Frozen to death at the kitchen table.
[00:14:34.976 --> 00:14:37.041]  Frozen to death around little wood-burning stoves.
[00:14:37.041 --> 00:14:38.704]  Just freezing to death in America!
[00:14:44.844 --> 00:15:03.173]  Commissioner Arthur Rosenfeld of Physicist's Fame for his energy efficiency discoveries at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said he supports changing the proposal because of the public concern because he expects most consumers will agree to grant utilities the authority to control their air conditioners in emergencies.
[00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:04.314]  Oh!
[00:15:04.314 --> 00:15:12.118]  See, because the old proposal just said, well, you know, you don't need it to be set at 76 at night.
[00:15:12.118 --> 00:15:13.218]  We will control it.
[00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:14.219]  Open your windows.
[00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:23.318]  99 out of 100 will comply anyway, he said.
[00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:24.539]  See, they know that.
[00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:28.261]  Adding that such emergencies occur only about once every 10 years.
[00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.782]  Uh, yeah, when Enron or some other group's robbing you.
[00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:32.983]  Some lawmakers express strong misgivings.
[00:15:32.983 --> 00:15:37.725]  I want to get somebody on about this, because there is no debate about this in Texas.
[00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:45.148]  In California, in Oregon, in New York, in Illinois, they just throw the gauntlet down to the slaves and say, this is what we're doing, and you'll comply anyways.
[00:15:45.148 --> 00:15:45.968]  You just heard him.
[00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:47.329]  But here, they just do it.
[00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:49.170]  Now, these are smart
[00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:52.769]  Remote-controlled systems.
[00:15:52.769 --> 00:16:01.170]  They do come in and jack into your heating and cooling system.
[00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.951]  And they want to have a bunch of other things be remote-controlled.
[00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:18.434]  You know, all the major new cars coming out by 2012, Toyota, Chrysler, GM, they've all announced that they're going to have infrared cameras in the dash, standard, that's hooked into an internal cell phone,
[00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:39.973]  And that if there are pressure, there's pressure sensors in the seats, and that if there's pressure on the seats, and the car is above 90-something degrees, I forget the exact temp, I know it was 90-something degrees, that it dials the police department, and then they're watching on the camera, and they said, this will save the 30-plus deaths each year of children being left in cars.
[00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:43.674]  Well, you're not for 30 children dying, are you?
[00:16:43.674 --> 00:16:45.375]  No, but it has nothing to do with that.
[00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:53.501]  It's about the cell phone OnStar platforms watching everything you do with a camera.
[00:16:53.501 --> 00:17:00.306]  And I told you day one with OnStar, the FBI was using it to dial in and listen to people, and now it's admitted in court cases without warrants.
[00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:03.488]  I mean, for heaven's sakes, Google admitted three years ago.
[00:17:04.807 --> 00:17:12.193]  But they're using the onboard microphones that are in all over-the-counter computers and video cameras in most.
[00:17:12.193 --> 00:17:15.476]  Apple now is coming out with the screen itself as the camera.
[00:17:15.476 --> 00:17:20.280]  Not a camera above it, the screen itself.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:29.248]  And they also have the patent for the facial resignation through that, where, oh, by law to make sure it's only an adult getting on the computer or whatever, you'll be face scanned every time you get on the computer.
[00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:34.706]  The keyboards are coming out now, most of them with thumb printers on it.
[00:17:34.706 --> 00:17:43.353]  Suddenly thumb printers are showing up everywhere, at the gym, at the salon, at the mall, the library, everywhere.
[00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:47.416]  I mean, do you see what the cashless society control grid is?
[00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:51.379]  Critics cool to smart thermostat proposal.
[00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:54.701]  Oh, the critics like it now.
[00:17:54.701 --> 00:17:55.262]  Is it true?
[00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:59.595]  But they tell the sheep, oh listen, other sheep like it.
[00:17:59.595 --> 00:18:01.436]  They like the bidbag wolf.
[00:18:01.436 --> 00:18:04.398]  Let him in.
[00:18:04.398 --> 00:18:07.300]  Little piggies.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.782]  I say not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.
[00:18:10.782 --> 00:18:15.445]  You can huff and you can puff and you can try to blow the house down, but if we stand up, it's a house of brick.
[00:18:15.445 --> 00:18:19.248]  But people think they're in a house of straw, so they open the door and let him in and don't even put up a fight.
[00:18:23.206 --> 00:18:24.927]  Face scanning cameras are up nationwide.
[00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:30.569]  They have giant Homeland Security blimps at 90 to 100,000 feet above every major city.
[00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:33.350]  Creating biometric scans of your walk, your gate.
[00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.331]  They know you from above.
[00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:36.252]  On record.
[00:18:36.252 --> 00:18:41.074]  Then the idiot public sees these huge blimps and thinks they're flying saucers because Larry King tells them so.
[00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:50.718]  You're getting video of the blimps with the cameras on the bottom, with the rudders, with everything!
[00:18:50.718 --> 00:18:51.358]  With everything!
[00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:58.013]  I mean, how much of this do I have to put up with, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:02.754]  How much of this do I have to... How much of this do you have to put up with?
[00:19:02.754 --> 00:19:10.657]  They are putting a total control grid in place and they're going to propose first taxing fireplaces and then banning them.
[00:19:10.657 --> 00:19:14.999]  Because they want you under abject slavery, abject domestication.
[00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:19.301]  Totally institutionalized under their control.
[00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:22.402]  Most states are moving to tax or ban new water wells.
[00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:31.275]  The animal ID, the premises ID, will shut down every small family farm and ranch in the country.
[00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:33.337]  That's on record.
[00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:35.980]  You gotta put a $22 tag on a chicken you can't sell for $4.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.340]  Wholesale.
[00:19:40.815 --> 00:19:43.937]  $1,000 a day fines for every day you don't report a dead cow.
[00:19:43.937 --> 00:19:48.381]  And it's not even a law, but they're saying it's the law.
[00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:52.584]  I mean, this is just lawless criminality moving at us at every level.
[00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.165]  And you're not going to hear the liberals talk about it.
[00:19:54.165 --> 00:19:56.146]  You're not going to hear Rush Limbaugh talk about it.
[00:19:56.146 --> 00:19:58.568]  They're there to keep you in the dark in the false left-right paradigm.
[00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:04.287]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.628]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:20:06.628 --> 00:20:10.231]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:11.172]  Be smart.
[00:20:11.172 --> 00:20:12.172]  Be safe.
[00:20:12.172 --> 00:20:14.354]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[00:21:00.151 --> 00:21:07.537]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:09.219]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:11.712]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:11.712 --> 00:21:12.532]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:13.513]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:14.894]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:14.894 --> 00:21:16.875]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:24.019]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:24.519]  Some U.S.
[00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:30.143]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:30.863 --> 00:21:34.365]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:44.831]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:46.072]  Fabled enemies.
[00:21:46.072 --> 00:21:53.817]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:53.817 --> 00:21:57.179]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.461]  Gold.
[00:22:01.461 --> 00:22:03.022]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:03.022 --> 00:22:09.288]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:13.473]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:13.473 --> 00:22:15.414]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:15.414 --> 00:22:17.056]  Mint, demand is at an all-time
[00:22:17.096 --> 00:22:17.877]  We're good to go.
[00:22:41.357 --> 00:22:41.717]  You worry.
[00:22:41.717 --> 00:22:43.778]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:22:43.778 --> 00:22:45.259]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:47.100]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:23:10.367 --> 00:23:10.867]  We're good to go.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.981]  Where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.
[00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:48.002]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers.
[00:23:48.002 --> 00:23:52.024]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:23:52.024 --> 00:23:53.404]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:23:53.404 --> 00:23:55.125]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:24:09.864 --> 00:24:12.452]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:14.518]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:14.518 --> 00:24:15.300]  We're here live.
[00:24:36.584 --> 00:24:39.747]  And we come back Sundays, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:39.747 --> 00:24:49.875]  Central Time, with the Syndicated Transmission.
[00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:53.879]  See, what's happening is, they know we're resisting their entire new or older operation.
[00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:54.920]  The public's getting wise.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.824]  So the establishment is hitting us with everything at once.
[00:24:59.824 --> 00:25:03.067]  And it's not just that all your homes are going to be remote controlled with your thermostat.
[00:25:04.884 --> 00:25:09.447]  It's your power system itself they're going to remote control.
[00:25:09.447 --> 00:25:12.829]  Not just to switch it off when they want, but to control the temp.
[00:25:12.829 --> 00:25:18.532]  They say, when they proposed it, that you don't deserve to turn it down below 76.
[00:25:18.532 --> 00:25:20.874]  And then it'll be 80.
[00:25:20.874 --> 00:25:22.935]  And then it'll be, you don't need air conditioning.
[00:25:22.935 --> 00:25:24.436]  This is neo-feudalism.
[00:25:24.436 --> 00:25:31.440]  You know, serfs in England 500 years ago, 600 years ago, they weren't allowed to gather firewood.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.361]  They weren't allowed to hunt.
[00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:36.163]  That's why they called the commoners the little people.
[00:25:36.163 --> 00:25:41.826]  Because they'd be a foot, foot and a half shorter than the nobility that sat around pigging out, doing whatever they wanted to.
[00:25:41.826 --> 00:25:50.110]  And then the nobility wrote books about how they were doing it to control the population.
[00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.913]  Large portions of the children would end up having brain damage from lack of nutrients.
[00:25:57.737 --> 00:26:00.058]  It's the pleasure of the elite to control people.
[00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:20.450]  You know, in 1989, in Virginia and Texas and several other states, the federal government tried to do a pilot program where everyone in the town, small towns first, would accept a box on top of their television set that would remote control the television set itself.
[00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.172]  And then the cable systems, as they came out, they tried to have federal law.
[00:26:24.468 --> 00:26:37.105]  Where you wouldn't just have FEMA coming over during national emergencies, but you would have the local government through FEMA transmitters and command centers doing it, and the public said, are you kidding?
[00:26:37.105 --> 00:26:37.726]  That's Big Brother.
[00:26:39.158 --> 00:26:48.964]  They tried to pass a federal law in 89 as well to make all radios and TVs themselves have a receiver to broadcast audio only of an emergency transmission.
[00:26:48.964 --> 00:26:50.946]  Now they're proposing that again.
[00:26:50.946 --> 00:26:53.968]  And how did they roll it out in 1996?
[00:26:53.968 --> 00:26:55.328]  As the Amber Alert.
[00:26:55.328 --> 00:26:57.350]  Oh, a little girl got kidnapped.
[00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:05.275]  We need to put up billboards, electronic at the government controls with federal money that are supposedly state, that put up announcements for kidnapped children.
[00:27:05.275 --> 00:27:06.896]  You're for saving kidnapped children, aren't you?
[00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:15.135]  And then now I drive down 290 in Austin and it says, report illegal guns, report terrorism.
[00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:24.481]  And we're looking for an elderly person driving a black Monte Carlo who came up missing in Plano, Texas.
[00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:25.402]  So, oh you're not for
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.741]  Finding the old people?
[00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:30.021]  But see, they mix it in.
[00:27:30.021 --> 00:27:36.144]  Oh, the Marines are out helping run checkpoints to catch DWI drivers.
[00:27:36.144 --> 00:27:39.686]  They're helping local police in San Bernardino and other areas of the country.
[00:27:39.686 --> 00:27:41.787]  I mean, you're not for drunk drivers, are you?
[00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:48.610]  Oh, the Army's announced 20,000 troops to deal with civil insurrection, but they're also gonna help at car wrecks with the jaws of life.
[00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:53.772]  I mean, you're not against getting people out of cars that have been wrecked.
[00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:56.133]  I mean, see how sick the psychology is?
[00:27:59.798 --> 00:28:02.542]  And it's all happening.
[00:28:02.542 --> 00:28:05.346]  Everything in your home will be remote controlled by the government.
[00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:08.551]  Your computers already are, folks, if they're on cable modems or hooked up to the web.
[00:28:09.747 --> 00:28:11.068]  It's all designed.
[00:28:11.068 --> 00:28:17.391]  Google admits they dial in and have a AI computer system because they said, don't worry, a human's not listening.
[00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:30.738]  A computer listens and creates a transcript of all audible words and even what you're watching on television or listening to on the radio to build a psychological algorithm profile on you to then tailor Google Ads for your screen and to sell it to marketers.
[00:28:30.738 --> 00:28:32.019]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[00:28:32.019 --> 00:28:35.061]  And it's the outrageousness, it's the over-the-topness
[00:28:38.587 --> 00:28:42.569]  Of just announcing it three years ago like it was no big deal.
[00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:45.110]  Oh, the camera will also watch you.
[00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:50.253]  And it doesn't just recognize human words and the TV and the radio in the background and you and your wife.
[00:28:50.253 --> 00:28:59.378]  If you have a dog barking, you will have dog food ads and dog toy ads and dog health care need ads.
[00:28:59.378 --> 00:29:05.041]  Google announced this themselves and people don't believe me when we link to the articles.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.061]  That's Big Brother.
[00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:11.002]  They'll never control my thermostat by remote control.
[00:29:11.002 --> 00:29:12.683]  They'll never control my car by remote control.
[00:29:12.683 --> 00:29:14.445]  They'll never control my TV by remote control.
[00:29:14.445 --> 00:29:16.026]  They'll never control my computer.
[00:29:16.026 --> 00:29:16.987]  Alex, that's ridiculous.
[00:29:16.987 --> 00:29:24.472]  TiVo doesn't track what I watch and then they come out and admit they do.
[00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:25.813]  This is Big Brother.
[00:29:25.813 --> 00:29:28.075]  This is what the computers are doing.
[00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:31.318]  We're being enfolded, sucked into the Matrix right now.
[00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:33.964]  But computers are double-edged.
[00:29:33.964 --> 00:29:35.906]  They're inanimate objects just like a gun.
[00:29:35.906 --> 00:29:38.127]  They can be used for good or evil.
[00:29:38.127 --> 00:29:40.189]  You can use them for good right now.
[00:29:40.189 --> 00:29:51.258]  But in the balance, the architecture they're building with the computers is an evil architecture designed to carry out total human oppression.
[00:29:51.258 --> 00:29:52.659]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.659 --> 00:29:55.201]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.201 --> 00:29:57.883]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.152 --> 00:30:05.676]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:05.676 --> 00:30:10.760]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.281]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:15.884]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:30:38.597 --> 00:30:40.478]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:30:40.478 --> 00:30:41.899]  And I say big time.

[00:31:10.894 --> 00:31:12.655]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:32:00.879 --> 00:32:08.964]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?

[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:16.633]  Now, I just went over some of the latest control grid going into place, including right here in my office, remote-controlled sensors.
[00:33:16.633 --> 00:33:18.695]  We all get busy, but I've got a
[00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:23.110]  In fact, guys, go get Tim in here for me right now.
[00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.510]  On air.
[00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.533]  I'm gonna tell Tim, we're refusing this.
[00:33:27.533 --> 00:33:28.974]  And get him to try to find the flyer.
[00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:32.117]  It was in here on my desk.
[00:33:32.117 --> 00:33:34.358]  A nice little pretty thing going, oh, you're getting this great new system.
[00:33:34.358 --> 00:33:35.819]  We're gonna remote control.
[00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:40.523]  I'm telling the city of Austin, we're not taking their remote control system in here.
[00:33:40.523 --> 00:33:42.144]  We're not their slaves.
[00:33:42.144 --> 00:33:45.787]  And even though I'm working around the clock, we're gonna go ahead and fight this ourselves.
[00:33:45.787 --> 00:33:47.188]  See, I'm not having to wait
[00:33:49.397 --> 00:33:51.719]  To have this come and affect me, it's happening.
[00:33:51.719 --> 00:34:05.471]  I remember early last year, I, at the time, had 14 employees and some contractors, and I got my Texas Workforce Commission forms we have to fill out.
[00:34:05.471 --> 00:34:08.413]  We try to do everything by the quote, system.
[00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:10.675]  You know, keep our nose clean here.
[00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:14.238]  And it said, yeah, you've now got your new North American Union, North American ID.
[00:34:15.495 --> 00:34:28.468]  That you file, you no longer file this state form through us with the state, you file it with the federal government in the North American country code.
[00:34:28.468 --> 00:34:29.289]  I mean, it's right there.
[00:34:29.289 --> 00:34:35.155]  I remember Jerome Corsi writing articles about it, and like a week later, I get it in the mail.
[00:34:35.155 --> 00:34:36.276]  This is all happening.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:48.305]  And we have to say no to this, and we have to go to the city councils, and we have to say, what do you think you're doing?
[00:34:48.305 --> 00:34:59.694]  I mean, now the Austin police chief is announcing with six other chiefs in Texas, all the biggest chiefs, the biggest cities, that they want to have anybody who's arrested for a misdemeanor have your blood taken for a DNA database.
[00:34:59.694 --> 00:35:03.697]  That's how it started in England, then it was everybody who gets even stopped.
[00:35:03.697 --> 00:35:06.859]  They're doing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:07.760]  This is happening.
[00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:13.578]  Big Brother is running wild right now.
[00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.519]  You don't have to wait for the New World Order to fight.
[00:35:15.519 --> 00:35:18.120]  It's here.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.380]  And it's not done through law.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.140]  They just do it!
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.701]  I mean, Texans don't know that, oh, they're here to put a new system in.
[00:35:24.701 --> 00:35:26.622]  We need to come in your house.
[00:35:26.622 --> 00:35:30.843]  See, before, the power just ran into the house and they had the power box out there.
[00:35:30.843 --> 00:35:36.825]  Now it's, oh, we'll be in your home or business putting in a new system, wiring it in to your appliances.
[00:35:40.123 --> 00:35:43.005]  And it's going to control your thermostat.
[00:35:43.005 --> 00:35:53.691]  Now, that said, the news I'm about to cover is so hardcore, that if I just come on the air and just cover it, it doesn't give it the respect and the importance to do it.
[00:35:53.691 --> 00:36:00.514]  So I'm going to wait five minutes to cover this, and I want you to call every body you know.
[00:36:00.514 --> 00:36:02.636]  You've got five minutes.
[00:36:03.715 --> 00:36:06.397]  Your neighbors, your friends, your family listening on AM or FM.
[00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.958]  Tell people at Red Lights, run into grocery stores and tell them.
[00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:12.921]  Businesses, call your local police department, tell them to tune in.
[00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:17.824]  It'll re-air throughout the week until we're back live on Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:36:17.824 --> 00:36:19.285]  This is important, what's coming up.
[00:36:20.919 --> 00:36:27.003]  Because I know this report's accurate because we've already documented every section of this.
[00:36:27.003 --> 00:36:31.667]  Is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago?
[00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:34.088]  The answer is they're doing it everywhere.
[00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:36.050]  This is out of the Daily Newscaster, D.H.
[00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.890]  Williams' great report.
[00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.813]  We're going to play some of the audio.
[00:36:40.813 --> 00:36:44.876]  Now, that is coming up in T-minus five minutes.
[00:36:47.967 --> 00:36:53.131]  Then we have Bob Chapman joining us in 25 minutes.
[00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:58.595]  Representative Dan Ides is it?
[00:36:58.595 --> 00:37:04.959]  Representative Ingbertson and George Humphrey in studio.
[00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:11.364]  We got two New Hampshire reps coming on dealing with right to revolt and saying no to the Globals and the Feds and martial law.
[00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:16.992]  And there's no more excuses to sit on the couch or sit on the fence.
[00:37:16.992 --> 00:37:23.777]  It is now openly announced that foreign banks are taking over the United States, they're building FEMA camps, that we're going into martial law.
[00:37:23.777 --> 00:37:41.310]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm getting reports from inside sources everywhere, sitting out the window from me, in the control room, one of my trusted crew members, Mothers, is a nurse at Seton.
[00:37:44.192 --> 00:37:57.940]  And they were called into a meeting and they were told that everybody that comes into Seton must be given a flu shot or a pneumonia shot.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.201]  That's the way it was phrased and then they added the caveat.
[00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:01.742]  This is how they mind control their own people.
[00:38:04.005 --> 00:38:10.067]  That it's offered, but that they must give it or they get in trouble.
[00:38:10.067 --> 00:38:11.327]  Whatever that double think means.
[00:38:11.327 --> 00:38:23.011]  And that when people, and this is the kicker, when they are incapacitated and can't refuse, they are to be given the injection.
[00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:28.307]  Now that's how it works with the schools and businesses.
[00:38:28.307 --> 00:38:38.437]  They say, oh yeah, we have a requirement you take hepatitis and all these shots every year to work here, or that you take all these, you know, it was ten shots, now it's almost sixty shots they try to claim you have to take for school.
[00:38:38.437 --> 00:38:40.839]  And they phrase it like, gotta have shots to be in school!
[00:38:40.839 --> 00:38:44.722]  And if you know to refuse, they might pull out the waiver form.
[00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.985]  But there's no law, so why is there a waiver for something that's not a law?
[00:38:46.985 --> 00:38:50.988]  See, it's all, it's just like animal ID.
[00:38:50.988 --> 00:38:51.549]  Premises ID.
[00:38:52.856 --> 00:38:55.197]  Only two states passed laws saying you had to do it.
[00:38:55.197 --> 00:38:58.278]  One of them was, shamefully, Texas.
[00:38:58.278 --> 00:39:02.200]  The feds just said it was guidelines.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.902]  But then the state had to back off and say, okay, it's not really the law, it's unconstitutional.
[00:39:05.902 --> 00:39:16.387]  But if you're in a 4-H club or in the county fair, you bring your pig, you bring your chickens, you bring your goats, you bring your cow, your yearling to show it.
[00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:17.807]  And they did this all over the country.
[00:39:17.807 --> 00:39:20.649]  In Missouri and Texas and the Dakotas.
[00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:21.489]  I've seen it everywhere.
[00:39:23.311 --> 00:39:25.232]  It's done as a stunt.
[00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:30.154]  They pick out whoever the winner is, so that it's done in front of everyone.
[00:39:30.154 --> 00:39:32.875]  This is how evil government is.
[00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:49.241]  And when you win second or first place, they let you in, but their regulations say to be part of the private group, you've got to have your premises registered with the federal government, waiving all your rights through contract fraud, don't even own your property, basically, and your animal ID agreement signed.
[00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:51.722]  See, it's corporate fraud.
[00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.783]  They're tricking you to sign on.
[00:39:55.586 --> 00:40:23.937]  And as soon as they win, and we've seen it in every case, they're either second or first place, and there's a huge crowd there of hundreds or thousands to see it, they then have the police come in and they announce, sorry, she or he did not fill out their forms, and they say, escort this young lady from the building, and the officers grab them by the arm, this has been in major newspapers, and the young woman cries, and the young man gets upset, and they take them off
[00:40:24.952 --> 00:40:28.462]  And throw them off the property.
[00:40:28.462 --> 00:40:29.565]  There's no law.
[00:40:29.565 --> 00:40:30.648]  It's humiliation.
[00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:31.972]  It's peer pressure.
[00:40:31.972 --> 00:40:32.774]  It's shunning.
[00:40:39.246 --> 00:40:42.829]  And then everybody runs out and they say, well, we better register our property.
[00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:43.810]  We better do this.
[00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.890]  But it's not registration.
[00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.533]  It's waiving your rights, signing your land over to the federal government.
[00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:56.259]  I mean, the government is completely evil and completely corrupt and work for foreign banks taking over everything.
[00:40:56.259 --> 00:41:00.983]  They're robbing and looting and they're tricking everyone into signing documents, waiving their rights so they can take your property.
[00:41:10.748 --> 00:41:18.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're now all over the nation going after roadside stands selling firewood and watermelons and tomatoes and squash and cucumbers.
[00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.831]  They're sending tax people after them.
[00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:22.871]  They're sending SWAT teams after them.
[00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:26.292]  People selling eggs out of their house.
[00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:28.233]  They want control!
[00:41:28.233 --> 00:41:29.433]  Do you read me?
[00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:39.131]  Now I'm going to get into this report and I want to be clear about this.
[00:41:39.131 --> 00:41:45.593]  FEMA was set up in 1979 and it is an arm of the National Security Council.
[00:41:45.593 --> 00:42:01.438]  The National Security Council itself has now declared total control over all federal agencies and homeland security and states under PDD 51 that the states have no rights and no authority and neither does Congress when Congress is co-equal with the presidency.
[00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:07.571]  In fact, the Founders said it had more power over the President.
[00:42:07.571 --> 00:42:09.573]  It decides when to go to war.
[00:42:09.573 --> 00:42:13.876]  The President executes it.
[00:42:13.876 --> 00:42:17.879]  So they're openly saying the Congress runs nothing now.
[00:42:17.879 --> 00:42:23.003]  And when they wouldn't pass the bailout, they threatened them with physical martial law.
[00:42:23.003 --> 00:42:24.984]  They have built threat integration centers
[00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:28.485]  In rural areas, they'll do it in three to five county areas.
[00:42:28.485 --> 00:42:30.829]  In major cities, they'll put it right in the middle of the city.
[00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:34.434]  They give free buildings, free housing, massive federal grants.
[00:42:34.434 --> 00:42:37.819]  I mean, they gave Boston $2 billion in grants for face scanning cameras.
[00:42:39.005 --> 00:42:41.427]  Hired tens of thousands of police officers.
[00:42:41.427 --> 00:42:45.549]  And so the cities roll over, do it, they're basically federalized.
[00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:50.813]  They can dial in to not the cameras you see, the big ones on the highways, but all the little ones, the face scanners.
[00:42:50.813 --> 00:42:57.758]  They can type in your name, pull up your cell phone in live time, hit another button, dial into your phone and listen to you.
[00:42:57.758 --> 00:42:58.999]  This is mainstream news now.
[00:42:59.758 --> 00:43:00.699]  This is being done.
[00:43:00.699 --> 00:43:05.967]  First time they admitted it was Wisconsin, the Wisconsin governor, said, oh, it's real great.
[00:43:05.967 --> 00:43:08.671]  We just dial in and listen to your cell phone if you're in trouble.
[00:43:08.671 --> 00:43:11.956]  The feds gave us this new system, so it's totally federalizing everything.
[00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:28.194]  They tried five years ago to order 14,000 first responders, police, firemen, nurses, doctors, medical workers, county, city officials, to take smallpox and anthrax shots.
[00:43:28.194 --> 00:43:31.615]  Only 4,000 officers took it under orders.
[00:43:31.615 --> 00:43:32.796]  Over 100 died.
[00:43:32.796 --> 00:43:33.396]  That's the L.A.
[00:43:33.396 --> 00:43:35.617]  Times.
[00:43:35.617 --> 00:43:37.818]  Oh yes, caused some type of inflammation in the heart.
[00:43:37.818 --> 00:43:41.539]  They had heart attacks, mainly men, 45-year-old and older cops.
[00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:44.006]  Killed him better than a hammer.
[00:43:44.006 --> 00:43:47.868]  Was that NBC reporter took one in Iraq and fell over dead of a heart attack.
[00:43:47.868 --> 00:43:53.291]  Causes inflammation in the uh... So the police said, I'm not doing it!
[00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:58.073]  So now they've publicly created, and again this is all in pieces, all admitted.
[00:43:58.073 --> 00:44:01.175]  You just put it all together.
[00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:02.256]  That they have recruited
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:29.709]  millions of firemen and police and other quote workers to get a federal stipend payment and they've done drills with buses right here in Austin Texas but all over the country to go around forcibly and to inject you with vaccines during an emergency under foot-and-mouth release which the British released on purpose in 2000 as a test that they admit they released it from a level four bioweapons lab and say it was an accident
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:31.660]  The U.S.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.761]  has adopted that rule.
[00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:34.422]  It's been in the Minneapolis St.
[00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:36.243]  Paul paper, I know that, and others.
[00:44:36.243 --> 00:44:38.385]  He covered it big time at the time.
[00:44:38.385 --> 00:44:43.068]  That the Army will lock everything down and kill all your livestock has nothing to do with they're even contaminated.
[00:44:43.068 --> 00:44:45.589]  A few hundred cows had it in a few areas.
[00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:49.252]  It suddenly popped up in one day in every corner of England.
[00:44:49.252 --> 00:44:50.212]  Impossible.
[00:44:50.212 --> 00:44:52.094]  They spread it.
[00:44:52.094 --> 00:44:53.354]  They admit they released it.
[00:44:53.354 --> 00:44:56.857]  Then they killed 4 million, or was it 6 million cows and 8 million sheep.
[00:44:56.857 --> 00:45:00.019]  And then wouldn't let them restock their cows and sheep for control to shut down the farms.
[00:45:03.496 --> 00:45:05.217]  Trying to break the back of rural communities.
[00:45:05.217 --> 00:45:08.339]  This is Pentagon warfare!
[00:45:08.339 --> 00:45:11.861]  Pentagon warfare!
[00:45:11.861 --> 00:45:14.083]  Their job under NORTHCOM is dominating.
[00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:15.223]  Getting control.
[00:45:15.223 --> 00:45:24.629]  That's why they tore up most of the fields and the date palms in Iraq, claiming insurgents were hiding in the woods, hiding in the bushes, all over the Tigris-Euphrates.
[00:45:24.629 --> 00:45:26.270]  And they only let them plant GMO crops.
[00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:27.131]  It's all about control.
[00:45:28.447 --> 00:45:28.927]  As the U.N.
[00:45:28.927 --> 00:45:30.448]  says, using food as a weapon.
[00:45:30.448 --> 00:45:41.752]  And I remember the Rocky Mountain News in 2002, the governor was in there, saying, yes, we have a giant incinerator that can incinerate thousands of bodies an hour, ready for the Al-Qaeda bio-attack.
[00:45:41.752 --> 00:45:51.436]  No, it's going to be a globalist bio-attack that will be small at first, to train everybody to give up their rights and have troops on the streets and, oh, see, it worked out okay for those that said it would be a problem.
[00:45:51.436 --> 00:45:52.937]  Then the next one will be the big one.
[00:45:52.937 --> 00:45:53.657]  You understand how that works?
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.741]  Well, this is up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:46:00.741 --> 00:46:05.424]  Is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago?
[00:46:05.424 --> 00:46:16.228]  An Indiana County municipal official in the city of Chicago, under anonymity for his safety, but I hear this from him all the time, reveals the contents of his meetings with FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:46:16.228 --> 00:46:21.731]  The initial requests seem reasonable enough when FEMA asks the county officials to prepare a hazard mitigation plan.
[00:46:21.731 --> 00:46:23.011]  They say under law they have to.
[00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:23.812]  That's federalization.
[00:46:24.392 --> 00:46:27.136]  to deal with flooding, fires, high winds, and tornadoes.
[00:46:27.136 --> 00:46:35.706]  But as the requirement meetings and calls for FEMA and DHS continued over a two-year period, the request became so unusual, raising suspicions of county officials.
[00:46:35.706 --> 00:46:37.649]  And they asked him, do you have a place for mass graves?
[00:46:39.195 --> 00:46:44.979]  Now, see, remember eight years ago when they had fires out west and they said, oh, the Army's helping.
[00:46:44.979 --> 00:46:45.799]  Regular Army.
[00:46:45.799 --> 00:46:48.961]  Oh, and some Mexican and Canadian troops are helping.
[00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:55.685]  And then last year they signed deals to use Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, engage the American people during insurrection.
[00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:58.126]  That's mainstream news.
[00:46:58.126 --> 00:47:01.288]  It was mainly in Canadian and Mexican papers.
[00:47:01.288 --> 00:47:04.250]  See, oh, you're not against the troops fighting fires, are you?
[00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.112]  You're not against Mexican troops giving soup out in New Orleans, are you?
[00:47:08.683 --> 00:47:12.126]  Huge convoys coming across the border, flying Mexican flags.
[00:47:12.126 --> 00:47:19.053]  You're not against Norwegian AWACS helping after 9-11 over the U.S., are you?
[00:47:19.053 --> 00:47:21.896]  See the PSYOP?
[00:47:21.896 --> 00:47:28.363]  During the legally mandated meetings held with FEMA and the DHS, different disaster scenarios were revealed to county officials.
[00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:35.942]  In late December 2008, municipal officers were invited to Indianapolis for a briefing on the state of Indiana.
[00:47:35.942 --> 00:47:44.669]  They were told if industry were to collapse, for example GM going bankrupt resulting in mass unemployment, a depression would soon follow and municipalities could expect to lose 40% of their funds.
[00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:47.231]  So the feds are going to be there with fiat money.
[00:47:49.093 --> 00:47:51.156]  Of course, this is all designed.
[00:47:51.156 --> 00:47:53.740]  Every county in the... See how they built all this up to this point?
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:48:00.229]  Now, oh, we gotta have a World Bank run everything now, Time Magazine says, and it'll knock the heads of the American people.
[00:48:00.229 --> 00:48:01.611]  Just fix things.
[00:48:01.611 --> 00:48:05.016]  Every county in the nation will be required to prepare a hazard mitigation plan.
[00:48:05.842 --> 00:48:07.063]  A federalization plan.
[00:48:07.063 --> 00:48:14.509]  The county should prepare a plan to vaccinate the entire population within 48 hours to participate and practice the plan several times.
[00:48:14.509 --> 00:48:20.214]  FEMA inquired to where mass graves could be placed in the county and would they expect bodies from elsewhere.
[00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:29.383]  The Sheriff's Department via the State Sheriff's Association was told that no .223 ammunition rounds would be available as the military would be purchasing all stocks.
[00:48:29.383 --> 00:48:33.184]  That just means buying it up for five times what it's worth just so you can't have it.
[00:48:33.184 --> 00:48:34.645]  They're already doing that.
[00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:43.748]  The county was asked to make plans for hardening of police and fire stations, putting in hardened bunker-type buildings around town in case of kamikaze attack.
[00:48:43.748 --> 00:48:44.449]  They mean the people.
[00:48:45.418 --> 00:48:47.519]  They're building bunkers everywhere, folks.
[00:48:47.519 --> 00:48:52.903]  So the bankers can totally bring us into receivership, and then reorganization, and then Soviet extermination.
[00:48:52.903 --> 00:48:59.408]  The county was asked to make plans for the possibility of up to 40, 400,000 refugees from Chicago.
[00:48:59.408 --> 00:49:01.069]  Now, we have the audio of this.
[00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:03.531]  We're going to play it when we come back from break.
[00:49:03.531 --> 00:49:06.033]  But if any of you are in la-la land denying this,
[00:49:07.453 --> 00:49:17.859]  In 98 and 99 and 2000, I videotaped, and my listeners videotaped, Marines and Army nationwide training to take over your counties and cities and training to execute Americans.
[00:49:17.859 --> 00:49:19.740]  It's on video.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.341]  And people at the time couldn't believe it.
[00:49:22.341 --> 00:49:25.723]  And they said, Alex had fake Marines and fake Army.
[00:49:25.723 --> 00:49:30.086]  Yes, I had fake Hovercraft and the Coronado landing in Oakland.
[00:49:31.889 --> 00:49:36.558]  And Cobra helicopters and Chinooks and thousands of troops and foreign troops.
[00:49:36.558 --> 00:49:37.360]  I forgot that part.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.163]  All on video.
[00:49:39.163 --> 00:49:40.806]  Sure I did.
[00:49:40.806 --> 00:49:42.109]  Sure I did.
[00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:43.071]  Well, now it's all admitted.
[00:49:44.355 --> 00:49:48.137]  But you will see them training to take your guns, training to break you and your family up.
[00:49:48.137 --> 00:49:52.278]  Now they've introduced the bills and built the camps, and it's all admitted, they're just putting a spin on it that's good.
[00:49:52.278 --> 00:50:10.345]  But the point is, you want to see what they're going to try, and then we have them not just doing drills, but doing quasi-drills where they would practice taking over cities, like Swansboro, North Carolina, and actually, where's that?
[00:50:10.345 --> 00:50:10.806]  Alabama.
[00:50:10.806 --> 00:50:11.486]  I've got so many videos.
[00:50:13.336 --> 00:50:14.977]  It's in Police State to the Takeover.
[00:50:14.977 --> 00:50:17.019]  Searching people's cars for real.
[00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:18.580]  People said, oh no, that's not real, Alex.
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.002]  That's footage of Marines running checkpoints, searching cars.
[00:50:21.002 --> 00:50:21.422]  Oh, really?
[00:50:21.422 --> 00:50:22.543]  Now it's just in mainstream news.
[00:50:22.543 --> 00:50:23.343]  Marines are doing it.
[00:50:23.343 --> 00:50:24.564]  Hmm.
[00:50:24.564 --> 00:50:27.426]  Now it's in a bunch of California newspapers and they say it's good.
[00:50:27.426 --> 00:50:32.070]  And the California Chips put out a press release saying they're doing it.
[00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.230]  See, it's dog training.
[00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.854]  It's all acclimation for you and your family.
[00:50:40.014 --> 00:50:42.595]  Now the military, the police, you have no future.
[00:50:42.595 --> 00:50:44.015]  The bankers are going to ruin you as well.
[00:50:44.015 --> 00:50:45.176]  They don't care about you.
[00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:49.437]  They're going to use you as their battering ram, their kamikaze against the people.
[00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:53.758]  If we scream bloody murder and let the globalists know we're aware of their plan, they'll back off.
[00:50:53.758 --> 00:50:56.259]  They tried this five, six years ago.
[00:50:56.259 --> 00:50:59.040]  So we can stop this together, but you better bust your butts.
[00:51:00.959 --> 00:51:06.441]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:08.282]  How will you feed your family?
[00:51:08.282 --> 00:51:15.625]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:51:15.625 --> 00:51:23.069]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:26.630]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.
[00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:30.572]  We offer a complete range of seeds, including heirloom tomatoes, old-fashioned beans,
[00:51:30.572 --> 00:51:31.092]  I think so.
[00:52:00.913 --> 00:52:07.670]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:09.334]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.851]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.851 --> 00:52:12.652]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.652 --> 00:52:13.653]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:13.653 --> 00:52:14.993]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.993 --> 00:52:17.015]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.015 --> 00:52:24.160]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:24.641]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:30.305]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.985 --> 00:52:34.867]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.867 --> 00:52:44.970]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.191]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:52:53.954 --> 00:52:57.315]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.805 --> 00:53:05.727]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:53:05.727 --> 00:53:13.171]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:53:13.171 --> 00:53:14.771]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:18.933]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:53:18.933 --> 00:53:22.775]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:53:22.775 --> 00:53:27.237]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:29.198]  Phase 1 is a One World Currency.
[00:53:29.358 --> 00:53:31.565]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:53:31.565 --> 00:53:33.230]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan.
[00:53:35.753 --> 00:53:35.994]  I think.
[00:54:10.679 --> 00:54:14.421]  Oh, they're doing bad, bad things.
[00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:15.541]  Very bad things.
[00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:21.444]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[00:54:21.444 --> 00:54:24.785]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[00:54:24.785 --> 00:54:26.186]  And now they know there's no going back.
[00:54:26.186 --> 00:54:27.706]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[00:54:27.706 --> 00:54:28.927]  They're going for broke.
[00:54:28.927 --> 00:54:30.528]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[00:54:30.528 --> 00:54:32.488]  And we're stuck in the middle.
[00:54:32.488 --> 00:54:36.130]  You ever loved someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
[00:54:38.127 --> 00:54:39.227]  We are back live!
[00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:58.288]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to D.H.
[00:54:58.288 --> 00:55:04.150]  Williams interviewing an unnamed Indiana official right across from Chicago.
[00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:09.392]  But we have this all separately confirmed, each piece of this from other admissions.
[00:55:09.392 --> 00:55:13.114]  That's why when I read this, I know this is part of the official plan.
[00:55:13.114 --> 00:55:18.116]  This official is just scared to speak out publicly about what they're being trained with behind closed doors.
[00:55:18.116 --> 00:55:26.219]  I happen to have things like Kansas City police, firemen, and sheriff's deputies being taught the founding fathers are bad, gun owners are bad, it's in road to tyranny, and that they're terrorists.
[00:55:28.416 --> 00:55:32.079]  So we know what they're training to do, and this is documented.
[00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.340]  Here it is.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:41.646]  There's some things going on here in Indiana that I'm sure people are generally unaware of.
[00:55:41.646 --> 00:55:53.755]  And I have some contacts, and I had made a contact with Super Faith to talk with him a little bit, but I'm not sure what happened.
[00:55:53.755 --> 00:55:57.278]  I think he had a nice storm down there, and I don't know if he's out of it for a while or not.
[00:55:59.674 --> 00:56:00.855]  Yeah, he's disappeared.
[00:56:00.855 --> 00:56:08.458]  No one knows what... I think he's just focusing on the family right now, but you wrote a lot of things in your email.
[00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:11.620]  Why don't you just go through them one at a time and break it down for us?
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.320]  What do you see?
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:12.960]  What's going on?
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:20.664]  About a year and a half to two years ago, we started being contacted by FEMA saying, you've got to put some plans together.
[00:56:20.664 --> 00:56:28.648]  The first plans had to do with... you know, the reason was avian flu.
[00:56:30.305 --> 00:56:32.847]  You're kidding me, wow!
[00:56:57.723 --> 00:57:00.505]  And that plan has to be practiced two or three times.
[00:57:00.505 --> 00:57:10.593]  I mean, literally, we've gotten every police officer we can, and buses, and volunteers, and set it up.
[00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:13.956]  And, you know, logistically, it's just really not possible to do.
[00:57:13.956 --> 00:57:19.100]  I mean, we've run through this thing a hundred times in our heads, and several times driving around.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.641]  It's just not logistically possible.
[00:57:20.641 --> 00:57:21.282]  But the point is,
[00:57:22.165 --> 00:57:28.594]  They want to be able to back people very fast for some reason.
[00:57:28.594 --> 00:57:34.102]  It might be bird flu, but my brother's saying that bird flu really... Stop right there!
[00:57:34.102 --> 00:57:36.986]  We're going to come back and play the rest and get Bob Chapman on.
[00:57:38.342 --> 00:57:41.724]  This is the cover for federalization and forced inoculation.
[00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:49.330]  That's what the pastors and the clergy response teams, and we have the secret documents that we posted a year and a half before it became mainstream news from the pastors.
[00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:56.554]  And it's go to the FEMA camps, take the forced inoculations, turn your guns in, don't get upset when some people are being arrested and taken away.
[00:57:57.415 --> 00:57:58.736]  But again, they're going to do this.
[00:57:58.736 --> 00:58:18.671]  They're going to have a biological event, whether they claim it was naturally occurring or some terrorist did it, and then only round up a few hundred thousand in a few county areas somewhere, have a beta test, have the army out, show it on the news, get everybody scared, they'll fix it, and then people will say, oh my gosh, you know, martial law's good, it saved us.
[00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:20.412]  Then they'll have another attack that's bigger.
[00:58:20.412 --> 00:58:21.593]  It'll kill hundreds of thousands.
[00:58:22.369 --> 00:58:32.553]  Then they'll have martial law, it'll get fixed, then a few years later, they'll release the big one, and they'll kill probably half the population of the United States.
[00:58:32.553 --> 00:58:35.254]  So see, that's why I'm fighting so hard, even if they kill me.
[00:58:35.254 --> 00:58:35.814]  What's the point?
[00:58:35.814 --> 00:58:42.277]  I'm just gonna die down the road anyways.
[00:58:42.277 --> 00:58:43.797]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:57.274 --> 00:59:00.237]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.237 --> 00:59:03.282]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.282 --> 00:59:08.008]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.228 --> 00:59:09.348]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.348 --> 00:59:12.590]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:19.593]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.972 --> 01:00:05.217]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.217 --> 01:00:06.518]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.518 --> 01:00:08.299]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.299 --> 01:00:10.060]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.621]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:12.422]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:17.374]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.374 --> 01:00:22.477]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:28.980]  FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security are preparing mass graves for martial law near Chicago.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.920]  They're doing it nationwide.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.143]  Admittedly, this is a scared Indiana county emergency head right on the border.
[01:00:36.143 --> 01:00:37.444]  Let's finish up with the audio.
[01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:38.464]  This is from D.H.
[01:00:38.464 --> 01:00:41.206]  Williams, the daily newscaster, and this is documented.
[01:00:41.206 --> 01:00:41.486]  Here we go.
[01:00:43.405 --> 01:00:53.210]  It might be bird flu, but my brother's saying that bird flu really is an event right now, unless they know something we don't know.
[01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:57.832]  Then the Sheriff's Department started getting long questionnaires.
[01:00:57.832 --> 01:00:58.732]  I got one myself.
[01:00:58.732 --> 01:01:01.293]  I didn't fill it out.
[01:01:01.293 --> 01:01:02.594]  Lots of questions.
[01:01:02.594 --> 01:01:07.176]  What kind of resources do we have?
[01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:08.797]  How many officers?
[01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:09.757]  What can we handle?
[01:01:09.757 --> 01:01:10.458]  What are you going to do?
[01:01:11.389 --> 01:01:15.757]  If Chicago has an emergency and you have 400,000 people heading into your county,
[01:01:19.825 --> 01:01:21.747]  Uh, where can you put mass graves?
[01:01:21.747 --> 01:01:24.129]  We need to know spaces and mass graves.
[01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:26.531]  Can you, how many can you handle?
[01:01:26.531 --> 01:01:30.454]  Can you handle bodies from surrounding counties and those types of things?
[01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:33.216]  And we're going, what the heck are you guys talking about?
[01:01:33.216 --> 01:01:34.397]  You know, tell us what's going on.
[01:01:34.397 --> 01:01:34.878]  Hold up.
[01:01:34.878 --> 01:01:36.159]  And nothing's going on.
[01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.981]  We're just, just contingency plans.
[01:01:38.981 --> 01:01:44.106]  If something ever happened, you know, we just really need to know how to handle things.
[01:01:44.106 --> 01:01:46.828]  And then I was contacted by
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:56.834]  Homeland Security through our, what we have to do is have what is called a hazard mitigation plan.
[01:01:56.834 --> 01:02:07.919]  Alright, well that sounds good and what they're saying is FEMA is saying that disasters are costing them too much money so we've got to have a plan to mitigate the
[01:02:12.759 --> 01:02:15.601]  See, that's federalization of the counties.
[01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:20.203]  They're saying, under law, you've got to take our orders and carry out these plans.
[01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:27.007]  And this is mainly to find out what counties and cities will go along with the system, or what people are wise to it.
[01:02:27.007 --> 01:02:34.831]  That's what the military's been doing for decades with these urban warfare drills, is finding out who's aware, who isn't, who they can work with, who they can't, who they can pay off, who they can't.
[01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:36.812]  This is how they take over third world nations.
[01:02:37.551 --> 01:02:39.652]  They're just taking their time doing it here.
[01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:40.873]  Back to the tape.
[01:02:40.873 --> 01:02:42.213]  ...happens.
[01:02:42.213 --> 01:02:49.757]  And I understand you've got New Orleans, you've got fires in California, and you've got tornadoes in Oklahoma.
[01:02:49.757 --> 01:02:51.838]  You have those things going on.
[01:02:51.838 --> 01:02:54.760]  But we're looking at them going, you know, look, we're in the middle of a cornfield.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.722]  What kind of disasters are we talking about?
[01:02:57.722 --> 01:03:02.884]  Oh, earthquakes and, you know, fires and flooding and...
[01:03:05.646 --> 01:03:07.007]  Tornadoes and we're okay.
[01:03:07.007 --> 01:03:07.887]  Well, what is this?
[01:03:07.887 --> 01:03:09.668]  What are the real?
[01:03:09.668 --> 01:03:11.589]  Chances of those things happening to us.
[01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:12.709]  Oh, it's very rare.
[01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:14.970]  But still we want to have mitigation plans.
[01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:16.330]  What kind of stuff you talk about?
[01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:30.596]  I just I just had my last meeting today with them in fact and You know, they're literally telling me that they want to Harden our fire stations What do you mean by that?
[01:03:30.596 --> 01:03:32.757]  Well, you know how when I
[01:03:34.167 --> 01:03:41.694]  Uh, a 747 hits, here's what he said today, a 747 hits a nuclear reactor and just, and just slides off of it.
[01:03:42.332 --> 01:03:44.333]  That kind of hardening we're talking about.
[01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:46.475]  What the heck?
[01:03:46.475 --> 01:03:48.596]  Oh my God!
[01:03:48.596 --> 01:03:55.801]  Well, first off, you know, I mean, for what reason, you know, if a 747 lands in the middle of town, it's not worried about the whole town.
[01:03:55.801 --> 01:03:57.242]  Forget the fire department.
[01:03:57.242 --> 01:03:58.763]  Yeah, oh God.
[01:03:58.763 --> 01:04:00.844]  Oh, you know, that's just an example.
[01:04:00.844 --> 01:04:04.066]  Well, you know, hardened against water, what do you think is going to happen?
[01:04:04.066 --> 01:04:07.509]  Well, we think this may be high wind.
[01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:10.671]  Well, those are two different things you're talking about there.
[01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:11.011]  You know what?
[01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:15.855]  What is going on?
[01:04:15.855 --> 01:04:24.738]  So, we have to put together, and I actually went to the first two meetings, there were six mandatory meetings, that was the first two, and I said, this is a waste of time.
[01:04:24.738 --> 01:04:28.359]  You know, if you don't, if you can't show, if you don't show, what's going to happen?
[01:04:28.359 --> 01:04:31.880]  Well, we don't know, but the law says you have to be involved in this.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:38.803]  So, we set up this meeting today and had this final meeting, but when we first got there, they laid this map out.
[01:04:39.767 --> 01:04:40.508]  Stay there.
[01:04:40.508 --> 01:04:43.372]  We're going to come back with Bob Chapman.
[01:04:43.372 --> 01:04:45.836]  This has got about 30 seconds left.

[01:06:07.742 --> 01:06:09.424]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.

[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.720]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.721]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:15.081]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.081 --> 01:06:17.082]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.082 --> 01:06:24.225]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.225 --> 01:06:24.705]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.705 --> 01:06:30.348]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.048 --> 01:06:34.570]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:37.351]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:01.957 --> 01:07:03.498]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.

[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.982]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:07:44.982 --> 01:07:46.223]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:46.223 --> 01:07:47.743]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:08:01.388 --> 01:08:04.155]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.155 --> 01:08:06.921]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:14.104]  Alright, finishing up with this clip of an emergency management official in Indiana.
[01:08:14.104 --> 01:08:22.587]  They spread out this big map of the county and then it's totally detailed and they want to, quote, be told everything by the county officials.
[01:08:22.587 --> 01:08:24.808]  Of course, they already know everything.
[01:08:24.808 --> 01:08:27.309]  They have federal maps of that they've quietly gotten.
[01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:30.231]  This is to practice having them follow orders.
[01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.492]  They say it's a required meeting, you gotta come to it.
[01:08:32.492 --> 01:08:35.293]  And there's meeting after meeting after meeting and then always there'll be more meetings.
[01:08:36.013 --> 01:08:39.035]  So, we set up this meeting today and have this final meeting, but
[01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:06.953]  When we first got there, they laid this map out.
[01:09:06.953 --> 01:09:11.354]  It's like 10 feet by 5 feet of the whole county.
[01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:18.116]  And it said, we want to know every important thing in this county.
[01:09:18.116 --> 01:09:29.979]  We want to know where police departments are, where weapons are stored, hazardous material, where can we land a helicopter, where are the airports, how big of a plane can you land in those airports,
[01:09:30.672 --> 01:09:31.993]  Where are all the bridges?
[01:09:31.993 --> 01:09:33.695]  Where are all the power stations?
[01:09:33.695 --> 01:09:35.396]  Where are all the generating stations?
[01:09:35.396 --> 01:09:37.278]  Where are all the substations?
[01:09:37.278 --> 01:09:39.639]  I mean, they literally want to know everything.
[01:09:39.639 --> 01:09:51.169]  I'm sitting there thinking of this, and I'm thinking, man, if there was ever a Marshall Wall, this kind of information is exactly the kind of stuff they're going to want, because we're just laying it all out for them right now.
[01:09:53.266 --> 01:09:54.627]  Okay, there you have it.
[01:09:54.627 --> 01:09:55.428]  Bob Chapman.
[01:09:55.428 --> 01:09:57.030]  I've reverse-engineered this article.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:01.954]  It's also from a good source, and we already have confirmed every sub-piece of it.
[01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:06.979]  This is nationwide, including rural areas.
[01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:12.684]  We know they've been building this for decades, but it appears they're bringing it to a head, and they think the financial collapse
[01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:15.918]  Well, first of all, you'd be commended for putting this kind of information out.
[01:10:15.918 --> 01:10:17.339]  There's very few entities that would even attempt it.
[01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:19.921]  And it's something the American people have to know.
[01:10:19.921 --> 01:10:21.302]  This will be on InfoWise, won't it?
[01:10:21.302 --> 01:10:21.862]  Yes, it's there now.
[01:10:42.725 --> 01:10:43.305]  It is.
[01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:48.489]  And because I want to carry that, so make sure that I get it by email.
[01:10:48.489 --> 01:10:55.593]  And it's hard to say what they're going to do and when they're going to do it.
[01:10:55.593 --> 01:11:03.619]  Yes, they could use the financial collapse, the chaos that follows as an excuse to implement martial law.
[01:11:03.619 --> 01:11:08.922]  Those who disagreed obviously would be somehow subdued.
[01:11:08.922 --> 01:11:10.503]  I don't think that's going to be easy for them.
[01:11:11.238 --> 01:11:14.579]  Um, a lot of law enforcement people will balk.
[01:11:14.579 --> 01:11:15.800]  Not all of them.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:23.963]  And at the same time, I think the attitude of the military is, if we don't get shot at, we're not going to shoot anybody.
[01:11:23.963 --> 01:11:28.965]  And so, the timing is very, very difficult.
[01:11:28.965 --> 01:11:35.707]  I mean, something like this could happen next week, or it could happen two and a half years from now.
[01:11:35.707 --> 01:11:40.309]  But what we have to do is hope it takes time for them to do that.
[01:11:40.876 --> 01:11:50.531]  So that we can get the word out to everybody that this is what they're up to and get these people out there climbing all over their congressman saying, why are these people doing this?
[01:11:50.531 --> 01:11:53.836]  Why do they need to find out the best place to bury 400,000 bodies?
[01:11:56.854 --> 01:12:13.942]  Well, they have all the FEMA coffins stored in Colorado and Georgia and Texas and New York and California and I mean, they admit, I have the mainstream articles where they say they've got mass graves ready and incinerators and coffins and then we go show the video of the coffins and people go, that's not real!
[01:12:13.942 --> 01:12:18.404]  Sure, it's a company that makes plastic coffins and there's a million of them out there, but so what?
[01:12:18.404 --> 01:12:19.444]  They need the coffins.
[01:12:21.354 --> 01:12:27.236]  Now the public's saying, well, they just now are announcing martial law may be needed because of the financial crisis.
[01:12:27.236 --> 01:12:37.901]  Bob, you worked in military intelligence before you became a successful stockbroker and then gold and silver dealer and then one of the most publicized, you know, financial writers in the world, biggest newsletter in the world, until you retired and then came back.
[01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:42.703]  I mean, for anybody who's studied history, this is a classic creeping death takeover.
[01:12:42.703 --> 01:12:52.028]  This is the German Operation Valkyrie that Hitler set up to take over Germany, and that they tried to reverse on him with, of course, what happened with the film Valkyrie.
[01:12:52.028 --> 01:12:52.988]  It's based on the true story.
[01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:56.871]  I mean, there's no doubt this is going on.
[01:12:56.871 --> 01:12:59.493]  The Army now admits they're preparing for it.
[01:12:59.493 --> 01:13:06.199]  You've got these poor compartmentalized county officials who are just now, the light bulb's going off because the buzz is going on out there.
[01:13:06.199 --> 01:13:14.666]  The good news is we do now have 25 states, it was 21 two days ago, now it's 25 states moving who have passed or are passing.
[01:13:15.427 --> 01:13:40.127]  uh... legislation reaffirming the tenth amendment states rights and in the bills it says no martial law no gun confiscation they're telling the state police and counties and others you will not break the law and and and and follow the new world order but then the state police are coming into the state houses and fighting them because they're really federal in oklahoma and other places we're having the state reps on we are confirming this bob this this is really happening but again
[01:13:40.968 --> 01:13:43.610]  The deuce X here is the states.
[01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.272]  You know, that is the cavalry, and I agree with you.
[01:13:46.272 --> 01:13:51.096]  Everyone has to go crazy with these documents, with the army bills.
[01:13:51.096 --> 01:13:53.478]  Have the facts go before your city council.
[01:13:53.478 --> 01:13:57.721]  Bring two or three of your friends to give their time to you so you have time.
[01:13:57.721 --> 01:13:59.363]  Get up there and say, this is happening.
[01:13:59.363 --> 01:14:01.004]  We know you're in consultation with them.
[01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:02.345]  Say no.
[01:14:02.345 --> 01:14:08.830]  The globalists will not implode the economy fully unless they think they can get away with this.
[01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:09.871]  You're absolutely right.
[01:14:10.789 --> 01:14:18.194]  And your reference to Operation Valkyra is a correct one.
[01:14:18.194 --> 01:14:24.878]  It's a slow-moving program that is encompassing the entire nation.
[01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:26.439]  And very few people know about it.
[01:14:26.439 --> 01:14:32.403]  And as you say, a lot of people will say, many people will say, well, what can we do about it?
[01:14:32.403 --> 01:14:34.344]  Or I don't believe you.
[01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:36.626]  But Alex, all we can do is what we can do.
[01:14:37.757 --> 01:14:57.860]  And that is, get the information out and try to get people to become active in going to the legislatures and telling them, look, we've got to pass this sovereignty issue and we also have to stop the federal government from ordering our people around in our state to try to make them do that.
[01:14:58.203 --> 01:15:08.650]  Well, Bob, I have to, every five minutes now, restrain my instinct, my survival instinct, because I have small children, to get out of the country.
[01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:15.714]  I understand that I'm a marked man, I understand that there's nowhere to run, that it's a global order, but I have to restrain my instinct.
[01:15:15.714 --> 01:15:21.598]  You, of course, left the United States years ago seeing this, but you know, you're grown up, your children are adults.
[01:15:23.203 --> 01:15:30.345]  You know, but I guess that's why I've expanded our operation while we're even upping the game, because, you know, that way, I mean, I'm just committed.
[01:15:30.345 --> 01:15:32.986]  I'm going to the bitter end.
[01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:41.849]  The nightmare could all end if the dumbass, and I'm sorry to use that term, but that's what it is, if the dumbass public would just wake up, man!
[01:15:41.849 --> 01:15:44.169]  It's so horrible, Bob!
[01:15:44.169 --> 01:15:47.010]  It's my 50th year in this.
[01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.691]  Believe me, I believe you.
[01:15:48.691 --> 01:15:49.371]  I've been there.
[01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:54.406]  And incidentally, if you want to hide your kids, I'll hide them for you.
[01:15:54.406 --> 01:15:55.386]  Oh, it's not even that.
[01:15:55.386 --> 01:15:56.987]  I know there's... You know what?
[01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:58.248]  I put it all in God's hands.
[01:15:58.248 --> 01:16:00.549]  It's just that primitive instinct, Bob.
[01:16:00.549 --> 01:16:04.652]  It's just constantly, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
[01:16:04.652 --> 01:16:05.852]  And I see the elite all leaving.
[01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:08.514]  We talked about this five years ago, Alex.
[01:16:08.514 --> 01:16:12.896]  Yeah.
[01:16:12.896 --> 01:16:14.457]  All we can do is what we can do.
[01:16:14.457 --> 01:16:17.759]  We'll just keep on trying and trying and trying.
[01:16:17.759 --> 01:16:19.200]  And maybe we'll be successful.
[01:16:19.727 --> 01:16:22.069]  But we need the listeners' help.
[01:16:22.069 --> 01:16:23.550]  They've got to do something.
[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:29.255]  Every one of you people out there must know somebody who's in state government.
[01:16:29.255 --> 01:16:30.556]  Take the time.
[01:16:30.556 --> 01:16:31.417]  Call.
[01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:32.378]  Email.
[01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:34.620]  Go to the statehouse.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.340]  Do something.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:35.961]  Please.
[01:16:35.961 --> 01:16:39.664]  You've got to put on a suit, and you've got to go to that neighbor that's a state rep.
[01:16:39.664 --> 01:16:43.728]  You've got to be professional and lay out all the bills, the documents.
[01:16:43.728 --> 01:16:44.008]  Oh, man.
[01:16:47.153 --> 01:16:49.153]  It's just so real, Bob.
[01:16:49.153 --> 01:16:55.355]  And it's not just a regular Banana Republic, corrupt El Jefe general running things, and they kind of leave you alone.
[01:16:55.355 --> 01:16:57.636]  This is the hardcore New World Order.
[01:16:57.636 --> 01:17:02.077]  These are the guys that when they gut a country, they kill half the population.
[01:17:02.077 --> 01:17:04.157]  That's right.
[01:17:04.157 --> 01:17:10.099]  And after that, they say, these are the people who are going to be allowed to go to school.
[01:17:10.099 --> 01:17:16.180]  These are the people who are going to be accountants, and these are the people who are going to be doctors, and so on and so forth.
[01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:20.821]  And they're going to tell you how you can breed, if you can at all.
[01:17:20.821 --> 01:17:24.143]  And they will tell you where you're going to live, where you're going to work.
[01:17:24.143 --> 01:17:27.985]  You'll have to have a passport to move from one town to another.
[01:17:27.985 --> 01:17:34.128]  And, uh, that expression, uh, let me see your papers will be very, very common.
[01:17:34.128 --> 01:17:36.049]  And, uh, it's going to be horrible.
[01:17:36.049 --> 01:17:37.810]  And they, they laid it out years ago.
[01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:39.090]  I had this conversation in 1964.
[01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:39.771]  And now that this is it.
[01:17:45.475 --> 01:17:47.456]  They're ready to act.
[01:17:47.456 --> 01:17:53.558]  They're looking for the right moment.
[01:17:53.558 --> 01:17:56.300]  And there's all these good old boys that think they're part of the system.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.140]  They don't understand.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:05.964]  In a tyranny, the majority of the public get looted, including all of the little minions.
[01:18:05.964 --> 01:18:09.285]  Either do what you're told, or you're liquidated, along with your family.
[01:18:10.267 --> 01:18:12.468]  Yeah, let me explain this to you.
[01:18:12.468 --> 01:18:14.990]  Police, military, FBI, others.
[01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.872]  Who do you think the thugs running this are going to know?
[01:18:17.872 --> 01:18:19.793]  They're going to know you.
[01:18:19.793 --> 01:18:21.214]  Who do you have scores with?
[01:18:21.214 --> 01:18:24.216]  Who didn't like you at Quantico going to school?
[01:18:24.216 --> 01:18:25.977]  Or who didn't like you in Police Academy?
[01:18:25.977 --> 01:18:37.965]  Or who didn't like you in... I heard the governor of Alabama, who they've had to release now, they set up, and it's now come out in testimony federally, that Karl Rove just didn't like him because he'd said something rude to him decades ago, so they just had him arrested.
[01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:44.295]  I mean if they can do that to a governor, Siegel, they've now released him.
[01:18:44.295 --> 01:18:46.496]  He did have like some seven year federal sentence.
[01:18:46.496 --> 01:18:50.158]  They de-sealed him for months.
[01:18:50.158 --> 01:19:01.424]  I mean the point is that most of you that serve the system, they're going to put you in prison and kill you because they know you know the crimes they've committed.
[01:19:01.424 --> 01:19:07.007]  Bob, you want to explain that to them?
[01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:07.628]  Well I think that
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:19.002]  You've become part of the system, we've used you, and now we need to get rid of you because you know too much.
[01:19:19.002 --> 01:19:22.823]  I think it's as simple as that.
[01:19:22.823 --> 01:19:25.044]  And don't forget, the law is what they say it is.
[01:19:25.044 --> 01:19:37.527]  It's like when I tell the people at the state, look, these are federal mandated meetings and you've got to come, whether you like it or not.
[01:19:37.527 --> 01:19:38.547]  Speaking of Valkyrie,
[01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:48.046]  Here comes Flight of the Valkyries.
[01:19:48.046 --> 01:19:49.867]  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
[01:19:49.867 --> 01:19:53.468]  It smells like, like victory.
[01:19:53.468 --> 01:19:55.089]  Stay there, Bob Chapman.
[01:19:55.089 --> 01:19:57.409]  Let's get into the economy when we get back.
[01:19:57.409 --> 01:19:58.830]  I'm going down with the ship, folks.
[01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:59.230]  Stay with us.
[01:20:03.547 --> 01:20:06.468]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:09.669]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:11.430]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.731]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:18.312]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[01:20:19.392 --> 01:20:23.053]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:20:23.053 --> 01:20:26.434]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:20:26.434 --> 01:20:29.295]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:20:29.295 --> 01:20:33.917]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:20:33.917 --> 01:20:37.038]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.

[01:21:14.389 --> 01:21:21.154]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:21:21.494 --> 01:21:25.437]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:21:25.437 --> 01:21:28.859]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:21:28.859 --> 01:21:30.620]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.

[01:21:55.016 --> 01:22:00.900]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:07.084]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.563 --> 01:22:15.688]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.688 --> 01:22:23.852]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.852 --> 01:22:28.615]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.935 --> 01:22:34.159]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:38.522]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.522 --> 01:22:39.603]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.603 --> 01:22:44.106]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:45.487]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.999 --> 01:22:51.984]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:23:00.655 --> 01:23:02.636]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:23:02.636 --> 01:23:07.998]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:23:07.998 --> 01:23:09.599]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:23:09.599 --> 01:23:18.002]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:23:18.002 --> 01:23:23.725]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:23:23.905 --> 01:23:25.746]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:23:25.746 --> 01:23:27.928]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:23:27.928 --> 01:23:32.451]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:23:32.451 --> 01:23:34.673]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:23:34.673 --> 01:23:42.519]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:23:42.619 --> 01:23:43.700]  You know, I go back to the Alamo.
[01:24:09.065 --> 01:24:10.527]  They knew the enemy was coming.
[01:24:10.527 --> 01:24:14.431]  When they got there, they knew they were outnumbered 10 to 1.
[01:24:14.431 --> 01:24:17.133]  They sent out riders for help.
[01:24:17.133 --> 01:24:21.438]  The help didn't get there on time.
[01:24:21.438 --> 01:24:22.018]  And we're here.
[01:24:22.018 --> 01:24:24.261]  We've been riding all along.
[01:24:24.261 --> 01:24:26.403]  We've had the information, the sources.
[01:24:26.403 --> 01:24:27.844]  We understand what's going on.
[01:24:27.844 --> 01:24:29.706]  It's horrible beyond imagination.
[01:24:31.477 --> 01:24:51.304]  And we're here right now saying to all of you, you better scream bloody murder, you better have your facts straight, you better get out there, and then the globalists will back off and may even ease off on the economy, but if they think you're going to go along with martial law through an implosion where they get to reorganize everything and control it, they're going to go for broke.
[01:24:51.304 --> 01:24:56.885]  And so, because I do love this country and I do love humanity, I'm committed to this.
[01:24:56.885 --> 01:24:58.426]  You know, we joke around, we have fun here,
[01:25:00.083 --> 01:25:06.006]  But sometimes I think I shouldn't even do that because it kind of downplays the seriousness of it all.
[01:25:06.006 --> 01:25:10.809]  At the same time, I'd go crazy if I didn't put a nice face on it sometimes.
[01:25:10.809 --> 01:25:21.695]  It's so real, it's so historical, it's so concrete, Bob Chapman, and I just don't know what else to say.
[01:25:21.695 --> 01:25:25.697]  Well, I think we've said as much as we can.
[01:25:25.697 --> 01:25:28.759]  People have to go to InfoWars and get the information and
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.500]  And it will be there, won't it, Alex?
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:40.523]  Yes, we have the article of FEMA and DHS preparing mass graves in Marshall Law near Chicago, and then under it we have links to previous articles.
[01:25:40.523 --> 01:25:42.783]  FEMA, it's not about food, it's about Marshall Law.
[01:25:42.783 --> 01:25:45.044]  It's not about floods, it's about Marshall Law.
[01:25:45.044 --> 01:25:47.004]  FEMA sources confirm coming Marshall Law.
[01:25:47.004 --> 01:25:48.865]  FEMA sources confirm Marshall Law.
[01:25:48.865 --> 01:25:52.806]  FEMA starts a PR campaign with new YouTube channel.
[01:25:52.806 --> 01:25:54.246]  Governor proposes Marshall Law.
[01:25:55.586 --> 01:26:17.336]  FEMA trains to take you to the camps, FEMA accused of twisting science and report on trailer damage, dark night movie reflects real martial law in Chicago, internment camps readied for mass illegal alien influx, US military preparing for domestic disturbances, FEMA preparing for collapse of Mexico, CIA preparing public for... I mean it goes on and on.
[01:26:19.744 --> 01:26:22.045]  And all the bills, all of it.
[01:26:22.045 --> 01:26:24.607]  People didn't believe us when we had the preacher documents.
[01:26:24.607 --> 01:26:27.969]  They were preparing their flocks for martial law.
[01:26:27.969 --> 01:26:31.071]  And then now it's mainstream news, Bob.
[01:26:31.071 --> 01:26:32.672]  That's right.
[01:26:32.672 --> 01:26:35.353]  But, you know, you're on the cutting edge.
[01:26:35.353 --> 01:26:37.955]  Well, we both are, but you more so than myself.
[01:26:37.955 --> 01:26:42.198]  And we've just got to keep on doing what we're doing.
[01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:49.402]  And we've got to get the people out there as best we can to act upon the information which is bona fide and
[01:26:50.362 --> 01:26:54.065]  Truthful and see what we can do with it.
[01:26:54.065 --> 01:27:01.713]  I mean, I'm astounded that we have 26 states declaring a sovereignty issue.
[01:27:01.713 --> 01:27:10.521]  I mean, if you'd asked me a week ago or six months or a year ago, if that was possible, I would have said, I don't really think so.
[01:27:10.521 --> 01:27:12.162]  And look what's happened.
[01:27:12.162 --> 01:27:13.844]  What was the catalyst for that, Alex?
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:18.301]  We have educated the patriots.
[01:27:18.301 --> 01:27:23.542]  So many people and so many constituents have warned their state reps over and over again that now I have them on.
[01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:25.002]  They go, we didn't believe this until we looked at it.
[01:27:25.002 --> 01:27:25.622]  And it's all true.
[01:27:25.622 --> 01:27:26.403]  You're right.
[01:27:26.403 --> 01:27:27.723]  It's martial law, FEMA camps.
[01:27:27.723 --> 01:27:31.904]  I mean, some of these guys are former army officers who have degrees in history.
[01:27:31.904 --> 01:27:34.165]  They know as much as I do when we get them on air.
[01:27:34.165 --> 01:27:35.165]  I mean, they know everything.
[01:27:35.945 --> 01:27:44.707]  And so it looks like folks have actually been doing their job and the states have found out under PDD 51 and John Warner Defense Authorization Act that they are to be removed.
[01:27:44.707 --> 01:27:49.368]  They've learned that Congress has now been removed and is now ceremonial.
[01:27:49.368 --> 01:27:53.890]  And so it's exciting.
[01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:56.750]  But at the same time, this is only introduced in most of these states.
[01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.031]  We need to have it passed in all of them and then act upon it.
[01:28:00.137 --> 01:28:28.295]  but uh... it just shows that that's what's so frustrating if we stand up and fight in the info war if we spread the word and say no nothing can stop us but it's inaction ensures the enemy's victory and i mean this is a war ladies and gentlemen this is life and death we have the enemy coming against us and there's those of us standing against it and we are deciding to put ourselves in the way of the greatest crime syndicate on earth because we know that you can't kneel to it bob
[01:28:30.163 --> 01:28:31.904]  There is no way to kneel to it.
[01:28:31.904 --> 01:28:34.505]  They will destroy you.
[01:28:34.505 --> 01:28:38.288]  They're evil, evil people.
[01:28:38.288 --> 01:28:41.469]  And you can't make deals with them.
[01:28:41.469 --> 01:28:44.771]  And if you're going to get killed in the process, that's just the way it's going to be.
[01:28:44.771 --> 01:28:47.653]  You can't submit to these people.
[01:28:47.653 --> 01:28:49.934]  Because submission is death.
[01:28:49.934 --> 01:28:51.875]  One way or the other.
[01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:53.356]  So you may as well go down fighting.
[01:28:55.589 --> 01:29:00.351]  Well, I hope a lot of folks don't just say, OK, well, when they come for me, I'll get them.
[01:29:00.351 --> 01:29:05.594]  No, ladies and gentlemen, you need to educate them now.
[01:29:05.594 --> 01:29:10.256]  Because I'm talking to a lot of police and a lot of military, and there is a buzz there as well, Bob.
[01:29:10.256 --> 01:29:12.097]  We got to push it over the edge.
[01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:14.258]  I think the enemy may have overplayed their hand.
[01:29:14.258 --> 01:29:17.780]  I think this could this could bring them down, Bob.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:24.843]  I think you're right, but we've got to get it to enough people, the public, but also, as you say, law enforcement.
[01:29:25.812 --> 01:29:28.873]  And we've got to make them understand what these people are up to.
[01:29:28.873 --> 01:29:34.376]  All right, let's get into the economy when we come back, Bob.
[01:29:34.376 --> 01:29:37.177]  Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:29:37.177 --> 01:29:40.438]  Just some days it just really hits me how real it is.
[01:29:40.438 --> 01:29:46.000]  I mean, I know it's real, but just when it consciously and subconsciously, in your heart, your gut, your soul, hits you.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.483]  They've built death camps for our families.
[01:29:51.483 --> 01:29:52.863]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.863 --> 01:29:54.384]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.396 --> 01:30:01.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.241 --> 01:30:02.922]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:30:02.922 --> 01:30:04.664]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:30:04.664 --> 01:30:12.490]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:15.672]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:30:38.547 --> 01:30:39.308]  We're good to go.
[01:31:01.027 --> 01:31:07.790]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:10.432]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:11.993]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:11.993 --> 01:31:12.793]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.793 --> 01:31:13.753]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:13.753 --> 01:31:15.154]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.154 --> 01:31:17.155]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.155 --> 01:31:24.299]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.299 --> 01:31:24.779]  Some U.S.
[01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:30.462]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.122 --> 01:31:34.585]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.585 --> 01:31:36.787]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:05.484]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[01:32:27.223 --> 01:32:29.345]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:32:29.345 --> 01:32:30.325]  this fall?
[01:32:30.325 --> 01:32:31.326]  Don't wait.

[01:33:26.805 --> 01:33:34.747]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[01:33:39.361 --> 01:33:49.445]  The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each sip and in each suck.
[01:33:49.445 --> 01:33:56.888]  Will you partake of that last offered cup or disappear into the potter's ground?
[01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:05.364]  Just thank God we've got people that are willing to fight.
[01:34:05.364 --> 01:34:14.828]  Thank God there's hundreds of millions of guns and tens of millions of people that are ready to fight.
[01:34:14.828 --> 01:34:20.531]  That may be the only thing that saves us if the enemy goes to red level and moves.
[01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:25.233]  If they keep the low intensity creeping going, we're going to defeat them as well.
[01:34:29.281 --> 01:34:33.704]  We've got everything good in our lives we have is because people sacrifice before us.
[01:34:33.704 --> 01:34:40.089]  And we owe it to future generations to do whatever it takes to defeat tyranny.
[01:34:40.089 --> 01:34:41.890]  We got George Humphrey in studio in the last hour.
[01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:49.216]  We got two state reps from New Hampshire fighting the New World Order takeover coming up next hour.
[01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:53.799]  I'm going to go back to Bob Chapman, The International Forecaster.com in a moment.
[01:34:57.276 --> 01:35:07.242]  As we continue to fund our operation and spread the info, don't forget the Obama Deception ships March 15th and the orders will be shipped out in the order they came in.
[01:35:07.242 --> 01:35:08.983]  Those that pre-order will be the first to get it.
[01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:16.155]  You can go to theobamadeception.net or link through on the big banner at infowars.com.
[01:35:16.155 --> 01:35:21.419]  You'll also be able to watch the film March 15th in high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:21.419 --> 01:35:27.544]  And the New World Order is betting everything they've got on Obama as the new front man to continue the agenda.
[01:35:27.544 --> 01:35:36.190]  By exposing him, and if this film goes viral, look at the Clinton Chronicles of the Clinton, and this is much more hardcore than that.
[01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:39.033]  By exposing that he's a puppet in a New World Order shell and a liar.
[01:35:40.063 --> 01:35:41.744]  This film is powerful.
[01:35:41.744 --> 01:35:43.345]  It's almost done.
[01:35:43.345 --> 01:35:46.146]  Then I've got to get mass-produced and out to you.
[01:35:46.146 --> 01:35:51.309]  By doing this, this is just one salvo.
[01:35:51.309 --> 01:35:58.252]  You're out there with your own salvos, but just pre-order The Obama Deception today, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.853]  One other sponsor, I wanted to tell you about
[01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:11.453]  Is it even really a sponsor at all?
[01:36:11.453 --> 01:36:14.393]  It's just super exciting what they're doing.
[01:36:14.393 --> 01:36:15.794]  And I believe in what they're doing.
[01:36:15.794 --> 01:36:17.594]  It's the best little AM unit we've found.
[01:36:17.594 --> 01:36:20.115]  When you hook it up right, it goes three miles.
[01:36:20.115 --> 01:36:23.716]  Then you put signs up everywhere in that three-mile area.
[01:36:23.716 --> 01:36:26.037]  And in high-density areas, you can get tens of thousands listing.
[01:36:26.037 --> 01:36:28.018]  In other areas, hundreds.
[01:36:28.018 --> 01:36:30.199]  And these are legal.
[01:36:30.199 --> 01:36:33.640]  This is a legal AM system, and it goes up to three miles when you hook it up right.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.100]  They've got all the know-how, all the documentation.
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:37.341]  And I happen to know what these cost them.
[01:36:38.336 --> 01:36:39.937]  Because they're hooked into the manufacturer.
[01:36:39.937 --> 01:36:41.479]  They're not even really making any money on this.
[01:36:41.479 --> 01:36:43.601]  So I hope you'll check it out.
[01:36:43.601 --> 01:36:45.783]  It's TruthAM.com.
[01:36:45.783 --> 01:36:48.165]  TruthAM.com.
[01:36:48.165 --> 01:36:54.090]  There's a banner on the right-hand side halfway down on Infowars.com as well.
[01:36:54.090 --> 01:36:55.932]  Here is a new way to fight the New World Order.
[01:36:55.932 --> 01:36:56.552]  Imagine having
[01:36:57.333 --> 01:37:06.377]  This radio show is streaming off the web and other shows on 24-7 on an AM dial to help get the word out about the new world order of the military industrial complex.
[01:37:06.377 --> 01:37:09.218]  Upper AM frequencies have plenty of open stations.
[01:37:09.218 --> 01:37:13.120]  You can broadcast with the Rangemaster AM certified transmitter.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:20.043]  It's the only FCC certified transmitter which one can operate at full power with maximum modulation reaching further.
[01:37:21.291 --> 01:37:22.312]  With the highest fidelity.
[01:37:22.312 --> 01:37:30.756]  These transmitters can be stacked or synchronized together, allowing for multiple units in one location across several locations near or distant.
[01:37:30.756 --> 01:37:36.659]  They also are completely adjustable and use only the highest quality parts.
[01:37:36.659 --> 01:37:40.902]  And Chez Cane is available full time to help you with your operation.
[01:37:41.854 --> 01:37:43.075]  They're great folks.
[01:37:43.075 --> 01:37:47.618]  Give them a call.
[01:37:47.618 --> 01:37:48.318]  800-579-0580.
[01:37:48.318 --> 01:37:51.400]  800-579-0580 or trutham.com.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.321]  And listen, you need micro-AMs.
[01:37:53.321 --> 01:37:55.362]  The crisis we're in, go for it.
[01:37:55.362 --> 01:37:56.963]  And micro-FMs.
[01:37:56.963 --> 01:37:58.444]  Have internet programming on them.
[01:37:58.444 --> 01:37:58.885]  The truth.
[01:37:58.885 --> 01:37:59.805]  Do your own shows.
[01:37:59.805 --> 01:38:02.627]  And then, have the listeners first before the globalists.
[01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:04.228]  Try this and this may stop it in your town.
[01:38:05.486 --> 01:38:10.528]  I'd like to see him try it, say, in Fredericksburg, Texas, where we've been on for, I think, like, 10, 11 years straight.
[01:38:10.528 --> 01:38:11.449]  I mean, good luck.
[01:38:11.449 --> 01:38:13.350]  Or even Austin, Texas.
[01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:17.712]  That's why I got the police chief saddling up next to me, wanting to be friends and go to dinner.
[01:38:17.712 --> 01:38:18.812]  Yeah.
[01:38:18.812 --> 01:38:19.733]  Sure.
[01:38:19.733 --> 01:38:22.894]  But, uh, that guy is something else.
[01:38:22.894 --> 01:38:23.834]  I know you're listening.
[01:38:23.834 --> 01:38:25.075]  It shocks me how much he listens.
[01:38:25.075 --> 01:38:26.216]  Hello, Chief R.J.
[01:38:26.216 --> 01:38:27.496]  Savannah.
[01:38:27.496 --> 01:38:28.296]  Um, alright.
[01:38:28.296 --> 01:38:31.338]  I'm going to go back to Bob, uh, Chapman.
[01:38:33.806 --> 01:38:36.327]  Bob Chapman, good to have you here with us.
[01:38:36.327 --> 01:38:39.607]  Let's get into the economy now.
[01:38:39.607 --> 01:38:43.668]  The establishment is jumping up and down saying it's the end of the world, trying to destroy confidence.
[01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:44.848]  That much is clear.
[01:38:44.848 --> 01:38:50.569]  Now they've openly again announced, Time Magazine this time, that they want a world government bank.
[01:38:50.569 --> 01:39:01.532]  The title of the article is, The New World Order, last week, that will, quote, knock the heads of the people of America, that will control the United States, that we will pay our taxes to, and that will control all industry.
[01:39:01.532 --> 01:39:03.412]  I mean, this is open world government by the bankers.
[01:39:08.396 --> 01:39:34.078]  If you remember, we discussed, starting about six weeks ago, my idea that what they wanted to do was to denigrate the system throughout the world, which they're in the process of doing, and at some point, devalue the dollar and default on the debt, and all other nations would do the same thing.
[01:39:34.078 --> 01:39:36.120]  And then usher in a new currency,
[01:39:36.698 --> 01:39:39.119]  In an attempt at one world government.
[01:39:39.119 --> 01:39:44.020]  And so the things that you're seeing going on are not through incompetence.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.360]  They didn't happen that way.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.981]  They were planned that way.
[01:39:48.981 --> 01:39:50.421]  When it's going to happen, I don't know.
[01:39:50.421 --> 01:39:54.222]  It's certainly up for conjecture.
[01:39:54.222 --> 01:39:59.564]  But the events are being put in place.
[01:39:59.564 --> 01:40:05.525]  The stock market has been kept from going down further than it is right now.
[01:40:06.383 --> 01:40:07.683]  By the government.
[01:40:07.683 --> 01:40:10.184]  You can see them in there every day.
[01:40:10.184 --> 01:40:12.944]  They're not artful at it anymore.
[01:40:12.944 --> 01:40:15.085]  They don't care what you think.
[01:40:15.085 --> 01:40:17.825]  They're arrogantly rigging the market.
[01:40:17.825 --> 01:40:22.566]  And they come in the last half hour, and if the market's down, they run it right back up again like they did yesterday.
[01:40:22.566 --> 01:40:30.108]  The market was down 250 points on the Dow, and ended up off just several points on the day.
[01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:34.489]  And of course, when they feel like it, they take a whack at gold and silver.
[01:40:35.606 --> 01:40:37.187]  Other things?
[01:40:37.187 --> 01:40:37.727]  Oil?
[01:40:37.727 --> 01:40:38.267]  Oil.
[01:40:38.267 --> 01:40:40.228]  I mean, look what they've done to oil.
[01:40:40.228 --> 01:40:43.530]  They've got it down to $34 a barrel.
[01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:51.654]  I mean, who would have ever thought at $147 per barrel that we'd be looking at $34 a barrel?
[01:40:51.654 --> 01:40:58.578]  Incidentally, the oil sands in Canada are now unprofitable.
[01:40:58.578 --> 01:41:00.319]  I think their break-even is around $40.
[01:41:00.319 --> 01:41:00.479]  And so,
[01:41:03.743 --> 01:41:10.266]  And they are the number one oil exporter to the United States, so that's going to have some impact there.
[01:41:10.266 --> 01:41:14.429]  But anyway, they are in there manipulating the markets.
[01:41:14.429 --> 01:41:16.370]  And they're not going to stop doing it.
[01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:17.530]  And they don't care what we say.
[01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:27.155]  They're going to do what they want to do, because they think that they're going to be able to take over and accomplish what they've set out to do.
[01:41:27.155 --> 01:41:29.876]  So what can we expect?
[01:41:29.876 --> 01:41:32.778]  We can expect before the year is over, and maybe quite soon,
[01:41:33.803 --> 01:41:46.046]  That the stock market will break down to new low levels, probably 6,000, 6,500 on the Dow, and it's around 7,900 approximately right now.
[01:41:46.046 --> 01:41:59.829]  If that happens, I would expect that gold would move higher, perhaps go up and test its highs, perhaps go up to $1,200 an ounce, maybe $1,700 an ounce this year, who knows?
[01:41:59.829 --> 01:42:03.230]  All I know is that when you have a depression,
[01:42:04.249 --> 01:42:08.532]  The only thing that holds its value against everything else is gold.
[01:42:08.532 --> 01:42:09.073]  Keep it in mind.
[01:42:09.073 --> 01:42:21.843]  Well, Bob, you said two weeks ago here, when gold was at $8.40, that you thought it was going to go up and test $8.30, and then it went past that, that it was going to probably go up to $1,000 very soon.
[01:42:21.843 --> 01:42:26.787]  It's hit, what, $9.45 this week, and it's right up there right now?
[01:42:26.787 --> 01:42:28.608]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:42:28.608 --> 01:42:31.891]  It slipped back here this morning.
[01:42:34.583 --> 01:42:38.484]  At 3.30 this morning it was down 9.80.
[01:42:38.484 --> 01:42:44.806]  Yesterday it was off a little bit.
[01:42:44.806 --> 01:42:51.608]  And what they call this is a slight retracement.
[01:42:51.608 --> 01:42:55.749]  And they call it, technically, filling gaps.
[01:42:55.749 --> 01:42:58.470]  And that's what Gold is doing right now.
[01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:02.951]  The technicians are allowing the gaps to get filled here for the next launch.
[01:43:03.467 --> 01:43:13.134]  Which will be against the former high, Interday $1,033, if memory serves me correctly.
[01:43:13.134 --> 01:43:24.603]  And so, fortunately, especially for subscribers and listeners who are doing business with Midas, when I made that call a couple of weeks ago, I was dead on.
[01:43:24.603 --> 01:43:31.127]  I'm a little disappointed that I didn't actually pick the Interday bottom of 812, but that's okay.
[01:43:31.127 --> 01:43:31.988]  I was close enough.
[01:43:33.081 --> 01:43:44.091]  And we're in a very powerful move, and the commercial shorts continue to increase their short position.
[01:43:44.091 --> 01:43:48.154]  And they're short right now around 170,000 contracts.
[01:43:48.154 --> 01:43:53.459]  Long term, they're usually short 95, so whatever is beyond that is new.
[01:43:53.459 --> 01:43:58.743]  Not too long ago, several months ago, their short positions were over 200,000.
[01:44:00.151 --> 01:44:14.218]  They went to about $230,000, so we have that distance between $170,000 and $230,000 contracts that speculators can come in and buy gold.
[01:44:14.218 --> 01:44:16.219]  Speculators are out of the market.
[01:44:16.219 --> 01:44:22.102]  And if they come in, this thing's going to whiplash and just go bang, upward.
[01:44:22.102 --> 01:44:23.543]  So it looks very, very good.
[01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.533]  Now Bob, I'm looking at the chart right now.
[01:44:26.533 --> 01:44:29.574]  Gold went to a high of $946 an ounce.
[01:44:29.574 --> 01:44:31.055]  It's at $939 right now.
[01:44:31.055 --> 01:44:34.357]  That is up over $130 just in the last, what, month?
[01:44:34.357 --> 01:44:36.618]  That's correct, since we made the call.
[01:44:50.396 --> 01:44:53.037]  And I don't try to play the market short term.
[01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:56.959]  I just try to tell people, look, this thing's ready to go.
[01:44:56.959 --> 01:45:00.100]  Go all in.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:06.463]  And many of them have, and needless to say, they're prospering because of it.
[01:45:06.463 --> 01:45:11.486]  But I think this is going to reach and test and go through.
[01:45:11.486 --> 01:45:14.327]  And it's going to be very powerful.
[01:45:14.327 --> 01:45:16.388]  It's going to be an awful lot of money made.
[01:45:16.388 --> 01:45:17.028]  You know what, Ted?
[01:45:17.028 --> 01:45:18.309]  I'll throw it on there.
[01:45:18.309 --> 01:45:18.669]  Sorry, Bob.
[01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.889]  Go ahead.
[01:45:20.796 --> 01:45:22.157]  Say that again, please.
[01:45:22.157 --> 01:45:32.526]  I was saying, Ted offered on air two days ago gold that he bought in the market at $830 at the $935 level.
[01:45:32.526 --> 01:45:40.352]  That was over $100 over when he bought the gold in the market, beating even his previous deals.
[01:45:40.352 --> 01:45:44.015]  I told listeners that he was going to run out of that gold at that price.
[01:45:44.015 --> 01:45:44.816]  He did.
[01:45:44.816 --> 01:45:45.336]  It's gone.
[01:45:47.597 --> 01:45:52.828]  He was able to get a deal near that, and he still has some silver at the old deal, but the gold is gone at the old deal.
[01:45:52.828 --> 01:45:55.333]  I wanted to bring Ted in briefly, and if folks don't...
[01:45:56.738 --> 01:45:58.599]  Take advantage of it, they're insane.
[01:45:58.599 --> 01:46:04.281]  Gold was, you know, 280 bucks, what, 5, 6, 7 years ago, and now it's, you know, up at 940.
[01:46:04.281 --> 01:46:07.062]  It's been up to 1,030.
[01:46:07.062 --> 01:46:12.404]  All I know is, they can play games with it, but long term, it's only going up in a hyperinflationary system.
[01:46:12.404 --> 01:46:13.985]  I mean, is it a 100% investment?
[01:46:13.985 --> 01:46:16.005]  There's no such thing, especially in this market.
[01:46:16.005 --> 01:46:18.166]  But it is the safest bet out there.
[01:46:18.166 --> 01:46:19.367]  It's what the elites buy.
[01:46:19.367 --> 01:46:22.368]  Ted Anderson, tell folks the new insanely good offer.
[01:46:22.918 --> 01:46:23.959]  Well, here's what it is.
[01:46:23.959 --> 01:46:28.742]  I mean, when gold was down there at $8.30 level, I did pick up a bunch of stuff.
[01:46:28.742 --> 01:46:32.604]  We were offering those Franks down there at $2.02 at that time.
[01:46:32.604 --> 01:46:34.605]  Now, they're currently at $2.21.
[01:46:34.605 --> 01:46:37.767]  Now, you could say, well, they're up and it's too late to buy it.
[01:46:37.767 --> 01:46:38.788]  Not really.
[01:46:38.788 --> 01:46:44.471]  Because gold, currently right now at this time, this is the stuff that I picked up at $8.70.
[01:46:44.471 --> 01:46:46.372]  Gold Franks at this time are at $2.35.
[01:46:46.372 --> 01:46:47.453]  So I have them at $2.21.
[01:46:47.453 --> 01:46:48.014]  A fabulous buy.
[01:46:50.762 --> 01:46:53.983]  And then I have the British Sovereigns right now, we've been talking about those.
[01:46:53.983 --> 01:47:00.804]  Presently I have those at the price of $275, and the market right now is carrying them for $288.
[01:47:00.804 --> 01:47:12.767]  The thing that I have that's still down there, when that silver was low, at that $9 to $10 level, I was picking up bags of Walking Liberties and bags of Mercury Dimes.
[01:47:13.433 --> 01:47:18.796]  And I have the Walking Liberties currently right now at $8.69 or $1.73 per roll.
[01:47:18.796 --> 01:47:20.918]  They're going to be up a lot higher.
[01:47:20.918 --> 01:47:24.320]  The Mercury Dimes currently right now are at $1.59 each, or $1,590 per units of 100 face.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:29.283]  And both of those are a fabulous buy, but we have older $10 Liberties and $20 gold pieces.
[01:47:29.283 --> 01:47:33.065]  I mean, we have a whole array of things here that, you know, when I see the market dipping,
[01:47:41.929 --> 01:47:42.069]  No, I
[01:47:59.864 --> 01:48:05.766]  Well, the thing about it is, Bob, I mean, if I can get in here and just take advantage of those market dips, I mean, like you said, when gold was down there at that $8.17,
[01:48:29.761 --> 01:48:30.922]  And you're saying buy.
[01:48:30.922 --> 01:48:32.102]  I'm right with you.
[01:48:32.102 --> 01:48:48.853]  I'm like, you know, I need to buy as much as I can, stack it up in my safe, get as much coming to me at that price level as I can, because I just know that with the President and Congress and everything that's going on, the news that's out there, that you can count on the fact
[01:48:49.261 --> 01:48:59.937]  That it's going to go back up again, and that's exactly what it's been doing for the last year, year and a half, and there's no question about it in my mind that if I can get in and take advantage of it.
[01:48:59.937 --> 01:49:04.944]  When that thing broke back down below that $900 level and started dipping around $870,
[01:49:06.531 --> 01:49:07.492]  I'm accumulating.
[01:49:07.492 --> 01:49:13.836]  I know most of the people in the market are like getting scared and they're covering their mouth and going, oh, it's coming back down again.
[01:49:13.836 --> 01:49:14.817]  I can't buy this.
[01:49:14.817 --> 01:49:17.059]  That's just the exact opposite of what you need to do.
[01:49:17.059 --> 01:49:18.960]  You need to buy it at that time.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.721]  Ted always tells you buy when it's low.
[01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:23.223]  Look at the chart, it's only going straight up.
[01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:24.003]  But people don't.
[01:49:24.003 --> 01:49:24.864]  They buy when it's high.
[01:49:24.864 --> 01:49:26.745]  So Ted does the best thing.
[01:49:26.745 --> 01:49:29.487]  He buys it when it's low and sells it to you at the low price.
[01:49:29.487 --> 01:49:31.589]  When it's high, when he knows you'll act,
[01:49:32.109 --> 01:49:35.270]  So, it's just a win-win-win-win-win all around.
[01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:36.591]  You cannot beat this deal.
[01:49:36.591 --> 01:49:53.337]  So, you've got Sovereigns, you've got Franks, you've got $10, you've got $20 gold pieces, you've got Silver Dimes, right now at the insane level of $870 with gold up there at $940 right now as we speak.
[01:49:53.337 --> 01:49:55.017]  So, folks, please take advantage of this $800, $686.
[01:49:56.698 --> 01:49:57.218]  2-2-3-7-1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:57.218 --> 01:50:03.181]  Ted, the old deal's gone now.
[01:50:03.181 --> 01:50:05.242]  We told folks this is the next best thing.
[01:50:05.242 --> 01:50:07.122]  How long can you hold this?
[01:50:07.122 --> 01:50:09.724]  Well, I'm going to be holding on all the way.
[01:50:09.724 --> 01:50:13.885]  I know it's Friday, so I'm prepared to go right through to Monday.
[01:50:13.885 --> 01:50:17.067]  As we turn the clock midnight, I'm stopping it.
[01:50:17.067 --> 01:50:20.028]  And if the prices hold and for some reason I'm able to
[01:50:20.444 --> 01:50:22.485]  I'm able to do some more inventory after that.
[01:50:22.485 --> 01:50:25.626]  I'll do it, but I'm going to have to keep an eye on it.
[01:50:25.626 --> 01:50:27.027]  All right.
[01:50:27.027 --> 01:50:27.327]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:27.327 --> 01:50:34.049]  And folks, for the last three weeks I've been to buy a few gold coins and some silver for my family, and I've been too busy and I haven't done it, so I know how it is.
[01:50:34.049 --> 01:50:34.630]  Guess what?
[01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:37.591]  Alex gets the new price, but it's still the best price anywhere in the market.
[01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:41.675]  Don't wait until it goes up even more, like I've done.
[01:50:41.675 --> 01:50:41.735]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:42.196]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:42.196 --> 01:50:45.700]  They'll be there right through to Sunday night, right Ted?
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:46.140]  Be here.
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:47.963]  Alright, thank you Ted Anderson.
[01:50:47.963 --> 01:50:48.423]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:48.423 --> 01:50:49.945]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[01:51:01.218 --> 01:51:09.462]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:14.025]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:51:14.025 --> 01:51:18.687]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:51:18.687 --> 01:51:20.108]  It's a documented fact.
[01:51:20.988 --> 01:51:27.732]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:51:27.732 --> 01:51:39.837]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[01:51:39.837 --> 01:51:43.499]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:51:44.119 --> 01:51:47.240]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.981]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[01:51:50.981 --> 01:51:54.283]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:51:54.283 --> 01:51:54.483]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:52:02.694 --> 01:52:05.776]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:05.776 --> 01:52:08.418]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:08.418 --> 01:52:09.599]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.599 --> 01:52:11.321]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.321 --> 01:52:14.183]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:14.183 --> 01:52:18.466]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:18.466 --> 01:52:27.493]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:52:27.493 --> 01:52:32.357]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:34.385 --> 01:52:38.789]  John, how dare you?
[01:52:38.789 --> 01:52:43.673]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.673 --> 01:52:46.015]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:46.015 --> 01:52:53.021]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:52:53.021 --> 01:52:55.864]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:52:55.864 --> 01:52:58.126]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:58.126 --> 01:53:00.608]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:01.397 --> 01:53:04.958]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[01:53:04.958 --> 01:53:07.418]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[01:53:07.418 --> 01:53:08.479]  Guaranteed!
[01:53:08.479 --> 01:53:15.400]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com has helped tens of thousands out of debt since 1993 and will free you from the debt trap.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:23.102]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com legally guarantees to put an end to wage garnishment, bank levies and liens and you won't pay one dime to creditors.
[01:53:23.422 --> 01:53:23.682]  I'm good.
[01:53:38.899 --> 01:53:39.539]  I think so.
[01:54:08.086 --> 01:54:15.049]  I mean, what do you really expect to happen when you let foreign offshore banks, since 1913, control the issuance of currency and credit?
[01:54:15.049 --> 01:54:16.990]  They bought almost everything up.
[01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:18.310]  Now they've domesticated everybody.
[01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:23.472]  They hired top scientists more than a hundred years ago to figure out how to brainwash and dumb people down.
[01:54:23.472 --> 01:54:24.193]  It's all public.
[01:54:25.211 --> 01:54:32.619]  And now they're wanting to pull a mass culling, as Prince Philip calls it, Queen Elizabeth's husband.
[01:54:32.619 --> 01:54:38.305]  Now they're wanting to have a big cultural revolution and convert us to being lapdogs and disarm us.
[01:54:38.305 --> 01:54:40.026]  I mean, it's here!
[01:54:40.026 --> 01:54:42.889]  Bob Chapman, I don't think they're going to get away with it, though.
[01:54:42.889 --> 01:54:43.930]  This is not Russia.
[01:54:43.930 --> 01:54:44.771]  This is not China.
[01:54:45.754 --> 01:54:51.961]  I know we're decadent and wicked people now, but there's still a lot of good left in us.
[01:54:51.961 --> 01:54:57.947]  I hope folks will get a copy of The International Forecaster, theinternationalforecaster.com.
[01:54:57.947 --> 01:55:01.491]  Get a free online copy of it, or subscribe, get it twice a week.
[01:55:01.491 --> 01:55:03.793]  It's a huge intelligence report, invaluable information.
[01:55:04.494 --> 01:55:12.738]  Or you can also call Ted Anderson at 800-686-2237 and get a free trial hard copy 800-686-2237.
[01:55:12.738 --> 01:55:15.140]  We've got four minutes left.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:18.901]  Anything else you think is important to add, Bob Chapman?
[01:55:18.901 --> 01:55:21.123]  Yes.
[01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:23.704]  I think next week gold will be moving higher.
[01:55:23.704 --> 01:55:29.487]  I think that the stimulus program will probably
[01:55:30.516 --> 01:55:35.938]  Levitate the economy for a few months, maybe as much as six, and it'll be over.
[01:55:35.938 --> 01:55:44.381]  I think early next year we'll have a new stimulus program, because the first one wasn't powerful enough.
[01:55:44.381 --> 01:55:55.745]  And that'll be over two trillion dollars, and all that will do is extend the problems that we have into 2012, particularly real estate.
[01:55:58.948 --> 01:56:13.413]  I noticed the other day, yesterday, day before yesterday, just before the market was over, the administration was talking about helping people with their loans.
[01:56:13.413 --> 01:56:16.694]  Where they're going to get the money from, I don't know.
[01:56:16.694 --> 01:56:23.076]  They're finally coming out with some of the details on the stimulus package.
[01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:27.517]  And again, as Ted said earlier, it's just not going to work.
[01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:36.733]  And we've seen history, particularly the 1930s and the 1920s, and we know what to expect.
[01:56:36.733 --> 01:56:49.758]  We know the failure of the FDR administration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the failure of the Weimar Republic during the 1920s due to reparations and other problems.
[01:56:49.758 --> 01:56:54.900]  And of course, that brought to power people like Mussolini and Hitler.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:57.201]  And I guess we're going to have our own version of that.
[01:56:57.685 --> 01:57:02.709]  Or at least the insiders think that we're going to have our own version of that shortly.
[01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:03.529]  One point, Bob.
[01:57:03.529 --> 01:57:07.552]  I don't see it going out to 2012.
[01:57:07.552 --> 01:57:20.821]  I mean, the commercial real estate going belly up, the car market going belly up, all these companies going belly up, stimulate the economy by refurbishing government buildings, and then Robert Reich is out saying, well, we don't want to hire white men.
[01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:22.682]  That's actual quote.
[01:57:22.682 --> 01:57:25.044]  I mean, so they're going to give the illegal aliens some jobs.
[01:57:26.618 --> 01:57:31.421]  Well, that's why I call him the evil dwarf.
[01:57:31.421 --> 01:57:36.605]  And I got a lot of flack from that when I did that, I guess it was about 15 years ago.
[01:57:36.605 --> 01:57:39.026]  And I've spoken to him.
[01:57:39.026 --> 01:57:42.489]  And he says, I know who you are.
[01:57:42.489 --> 01:57:44.010]  But anyway, he's no dummy.
[01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:47.432]  And he's part of this package of evil people.
[01:57:47.432 --> 01:57:50.975]  And they're pandering to the minorities.
[01:57:50.975 --> 01:57:55.858]  And that's the way they hope to continue to get their brand of
[01:57:56.425 --> 01:57:59.286]  Internationalism into power.
[01:57:59.286 --> 01:58:02.328]  And that's probably what George Bush was all about.
[01:58:02.328 --> 01:58:08.110]  Make everybody as mad as you can so that the A-team can come in and finish off the job.
[01:58:08.110 --> 01:58:10.711]  But I believe, I agree with you, Alex.
[01:58:10.711 --> 01:58:12.292]  They're going to go for it.
[01:58:12.292 --> 01:58:14.693]  And they're not going to win.
[01:58:14.693 --> 01:58:21.876]  And it's going to be very painful economically, financially, and there could be a lot of people would get killed as well.
[01:58:21.876 --> 01:58:22.596]  But we will win.
[01:58:23.883 --> 01:58:30.729]  At a price because we didn't do our homework earlier and this time they're not going to get away with it.
[01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:33.091]  Bob Chapman, always informative to have you on.
[01:58:33.091 --> 01:58:33.691]  Godspeed.
[01:58:33.691 --> 01:58:36.453]  We'll see you this time, Lord willing, next week.
[01:58:36.453 --> 01:58:37.274]  Thank you very much.
[01:58:37.274 --> 01:58:43.079]  Bye-bye, listeners.
[01:58:43.079 --> 01:58:45.681]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.803 --> 01:58:57.568]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.568 --> 01:59:00.531]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.531 --> 01:59:03.574]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.574 --> 01:59:08.299]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.519 --> 01:59:09.640]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.881]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.881 --> 01:59:19.865]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[01:59:53.894 --> 01:59:56.295]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:07.019]  Big Brother.

[02:00:08.779 --> 02:00:10.540]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:12.120]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:13.681]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.681 --> 02:00:17.862]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.862 --> 02:00:21.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.611 --> 02:00:29.995]  Coming up later in the hour, we're scheduled to have two New Hampshire state representatives on.
[02:00:29.995 --> 02:00:38.280]  They've introduced House Concurrent Resolution 6, that has the strongest wording of any of the 20-plus bills we've seen.
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:42.963]  Some passing states, some on their way to passage if you put pressure on them.
[02:00:42.963 --> 02:00:50.808]  Establishing martial law or a state of emergency within one of the states comprising the United States of America without the consent of the legislature of the state.
[02:00:50.808 --> 02:00:52.870]  They're saying the state is going to secede if this happens.
[02:00:53.891 --> 02:00:58.494]  Requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service for the people.
[02:00:58.494 --> 02:00:59.435]  Article 2.
[02:00:59.435 --> 02:01:01.376]  Slavery.
[02:01:01.376 --> 02:01:01.896]  Article 3.
[02:01:01.896 --> 02:01:05.659]  Requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service for persons under the age of 18.
[02:01:05.659 --> 02:01:07.720]  That's in the President's new public plan.
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:08.400]  Article 4.
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:12.543]  Surrendering any power delegated or not delegated to any corporation or foreign government.
[02:01:12.543 --> 02:01:18.447]  That's these criminal treaties signing authority over even private corporations, not just governments or multinational groups.
[02:01:18.447 --> 02:01:22.790]  Any act regarding legislation or religion, further limitations on freedom of speech,
[02:01:23.632 --> 02:01:30.635]  Political speech or further limitations on freedom of the press, which is federal systems pushing for.
[02:01:30.635 --> 02:01:50.323]  Article 6, further infringes on the right to keep and bear arms, including prohibitions on the type and quantity of arms and ammunition, and that should any such act of Congress become law or executive order or judicial order be put into force, all powers previously delegated to the United States of America by the Constitution of the United States shall revert to the several states' individuals.
[02:01:53.166 --> 02:02:09.336]  Any further government of the United States of America shall require ratification of three-quarters of the states seeking to form a government of the United States and shall not be binding upon any state not seeking to form any such government.
[02:02:09.336 --> 02:02:16.580]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen, and this is secession.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:19.242]  And there's now twenty-plus
[02:02:22.228 --> 02:02:25.993]  States with similar legislation introduced are passing.
[02:02:25.993 --> 02:02:29.117]  Now understand, people are like, how dare them try to overthrow the federal government.
[02:02:29.117 --> 02:02:34.323]  The federal government is constituted by the states and by the people, Tenth Amendment.
[02:02:34.323 --> 02:02:35.605]  We constitute it.
[02:02:35.605 --> 02:02:40.390]  The federal government's been hijacked decades and decades and decades and decades ago by offshore banks.
[02:02:41.249 --> 02:02:48.593]  Now they're not intent to have trillions of fiat currency and own hundreds of palaces and jets and incredible power and companies.
[02:02:48.593 --> 02:02:58.458]  They want to micromanage our lives and run every facet of our lives and disarm us and social engineer us and have remote control systems controlling our TVs, computers, thermostats.
[02:02:58.458 --> 02:03:00.719]  It's all announced.
[02:03:00.719 --> 02:03:02.179]  Shutting down farms and ranches.
[02:03:02.179 --> 02:03:05.181]  I mean, you can't make up something this bad.
[02:03:08.615 --> 02:03:16.308]  Now technology's allowing us to get around their controlled media, but it's also the double-edged sword they're using against the people.
[02:03:16.308 --> 02:03:18.872]  And that's what's happening right now.
[02:03:18.872 --> 02:03:20.195]  That's what's happening in a big way.
[02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:28.680]  So I beg and I plead for everybody out there to look at the evidence, to look at the information.
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.522]  You know, we covered this article and I've researched it.
[02:03:31.522 --> 02:03:32.883]  I've researched what's going on around the country.
[02:03:32.883 --> 02:03:40.829]  It's an accurate story from a daily newscaster in FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago.
[02:03:40.829 --> 02:03:43.672]  And it gets into the mass graves, the martial law, all of it.
[02:03:45.473 --> 02:03:46.094]  They're moving.
[02:03:46.094 --> 02:03:48.616]  The feds are federalizing everything right now.
[02:03:48.616 --> 02:03:57.622]  Obama just grabbed the census away from any congressional overview and is going to use it as a way to make Americans report on themselves and tell the government everything they're doing constantly.
[02:03:57.622 --> 02:04:03.006]  They're seizing the National Security Council, taking over all the federal agencies, saying Congress has no oversight.
[02:04:03.006 --> 02:04:08.371]  PDD 51, that states the President is absolute ruler, that Bush signed, that Obama's continuing.
[02:04:09.071 --> 02:04:12.032]  Notice he's not reversing any of those executive orders.
[02:04:12.032 --> 02:04:17.154]  He'll say he's not going to hire lobbyists, and frankly, I've never seen an administration with this many lobbyists in it.
[02:04:17.154 --> 02:04:22.296]  He's saying he's going to end the war, and he increases the troops massively, and now says, oh, 23 months, we'll look at pulling out.
[02:04:22.296 --> 02:04:22.516]  Maybe.
[02:04:25.043 --> 02:04:29.187]  It's gone from six months to 16 months to 23 months in a month.
[02:04:29.187 --> 02:04:32.109]  So I guess in a year it'll be 20 years till they leave.
[02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:34.572]  I mean, not two years.
[02:04:34.572 --> 02:04:36.033]  That's what's going on.
[02:04:36.033 --> 02:04:37.374]  That's what's happening.
[02:04:37.374 --> 02:04:42.058]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv in very dark hours for the Republic.
[02:04:42.058 --> 02:04:47.923]  It's a corporate takeover of the United States, the state governments, the local governments, your bank accounts.
[02:04:49.045 --> 02:04:56.210]  They have got you in debt so they can implode it and have a fire sale and then own everything and then you'll be dependent on them.
[02:04:56.210 --> 02:04:57.150]  That's the plan.
[02:04:57.150 --> 02:04:58.851]  Total domestication.
[02:04:58.851 --> 02:05:00.753]  Total institutionalization.
[02:05:00.753 --> 02:05:02.454]  Feudalism.
[02:05:02.454 --> 02:05:03.595]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[02:05:08.494 --> 02:05:19.120]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:27.164]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.

[02:05:34.227 --> 02:05:35.588]  Food is an everyday need.
[02:05:36.264 --> 02:05:41.846]  The 3 Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[02:05:41.846 --> 02:05:45.267]  The 3 Day Responder, $21.95.
[02:05:45.267 --> 02:05:48.828]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.

[02:06:01.167 --> 02:06:03.129]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:06:03.129 --> 02:06:06.753]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:06:06.753 --> 02:06:09.196]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:06:09.196 --> 02:06:12.239]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:06:12.239 --> 02:06:14.101]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[02:06:14.548 --> 02:06:15.288]  We're good to go.
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:43.644]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[02:06:43.644 --> 02:06:48.488]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:06:48.488 --> 02:06:51.351]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:06:51.351 --> 02:06:53.392]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:53.392 --> 02:06:55.394]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:06:55.394 --> 02:06:57.516]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:06:57.516 --> 02:06:59.298]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:06:59.298 --> 02:07:00.038]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:01.596 --> 02:07:05.118]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:07:05.118 --> 02:07:10.521]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:07:10.521 --> 02:07:15.664]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:07:15.664 --> 02:07:26.790]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[02:07:27.190 --> 02:07:32.953]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:07:32.953 --> 02:07:39.216]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:07:39.216 --> 02:07:40.257]  What about you?

[02:08:06.695 --> 02:08:08.978]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:21.532 --> 02:08:22.613]  Thank you.
[02:08:22.613 --> 02:08:25.313]  We are back live.
[02:08:25.313 --> 02:08:31.555]  We have Representative Ingbertson joining us in about 25 minutes.
[02:08:31.555 --> 02:08:39.238]  We have Representative Dan Itza joining us here in just a few minutes from New Hampshire.
[02:08:39.238 --> 02:08:43.379]  It's always fun dragging these men and women off the floor when they're in session or busy.
[02:08:44.676 --> 02:08:55.363]  Before we go to the next guest, I just want to encourage the listeners to understand that Barack Obama is nothing but a front man and a puppet of the New World Order.
[02:08:55.363 --> 02:08:56.504]  And I know you know that.
[02:08:56.504 --> 02:08:59.045]  I know you know he's lied about everything he said he would do.
[02:08:59.045 --> 02:09:00.126]  We knew that was going to happen.
[02:09:00.126 --> 02:09:01.227]  Look at who bought and paid for him.
[02:09:02.605 --> 02:09:05.726]  We have to get past his cult of personality.
[02:09:05.726 --> 02:09:12.167]  Remember, Bush was a cult of personality at a 92%, 93% approval rating after they staged 9-11, but that dissipated quickly.
[02:09:12.167 --> 02:09:17.028]  Because they need that messianic front leader to carry their agenda through to fool the public.
[02:09:17.028 --> 02:09:25.630]  I mean, he'll sit there and go up to old ladies and go, I'm stopping all the lobbyists, I'm stopping all the corruption, I promise you, I pledge.
[02:09:25.630 --> 02:09:26.130]  And then he's
[02:09:27.526 --> 02:09:29.907]  We were trying to do voiceovers last night with all the lobbyists.
[02:09:29.907 --> 02:09:30.907]  We had to stop.
[02:09:30.907 --> 02:09:31.547]  There's hundreds.
[02:09:31.547 --> 02:09:38.590]  I mean, they filled the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, right down to the twentieth post at every major department.
[02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:41.771]  Department of Defense, Department of Education, Health and Human Services.
[02:09:41.771 --> 02:09:43.832]  That's only one facet of the film.
[02:09:43.832 --> 02:09:45.473]  It's like ten minutes of the film.
[02:09:45.473 --> 02:09:46.933]  It's just his lies on lobbyists.
[02:09:46.933 --> 02:09:49.094]  I mean, I'm probably going to have to cut it down.
[02:09:50.834 --> 02:10:03.065]  The lies about the war, the lies about wiretapping, the lies about torture, the lies about... Because he'll say, I signed an executive order stopping it all, and you read the executive order, it doesn't, it continues it.
[02:10:03.065 --> 02:10:13.875]  But then there's the really scary stuff, the gun confiscation, the FEMA camps, the youth brigades, the socialism, I mean, it's all covered in the Obama deception, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:15.237 --> 02:10:20.380]  Right now you can order it on the Secure Online Yahoo shopping cart and then your order goes in the stack.
[02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:26.083]  There's a stack in there and from the first order to the last it goes in that order shipped out.
[02:10:26.083 --> 02:10:31.986]  We'll pretty sure have the video in probably a week, maybe even earlier before the release date.
[02:10:31.986 --> 02:10:37.929]  So you might have a little surprise and it might come before then but that's doubtful.
[02:10:37.929 --> 02:10:40.311]  The point is they'll first come first serve.
[02:10:41.394 --> 02:10:46.957]  We're going to have these suckers pre-packed, ready to ship March 15th to you, the Obama Deception.
[02:10:46.957 --> 02:10:50.600]  It is so important to get these out to everyone.
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.282]  It is so important that this go absolutely viral.
[02:10:54.282 --> 02:10:55.843]  I want you to buy DVD burners.
[02:10:55.843 --> 02:10:59.065]  I want you to buy copies of DVDs, you know, blank ones.
[02:10:59.065 --> 02:11:04.448]  If you've got to sell all the junk in the garage to do it, you don't need that crap anyways, the old jet ski rotting.
[02:11:04.448 --> 02:11:07.750]  And just have a duplication place to make a thousand copies.
[02:11:09.605 --> 02:11:12.787]  I don't want to say I don't care, I want you to make copies.
[02:11:12.787 --> 02:11:18.011]  I want this sucker to go to the four wins and it'll be up on PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[02:11:18.011 --> 02:11:20.572]  You can burn it to disk or DVD.
[02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:22.954]  PrisonPlanet.tv, get your membership there now.
[02:11:22.954 --> 02:11:33.881]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month and this goes back into our war chest to expand the fight and hire more people and get more done here in the fight against the globalists.
[02:11:35.285 --> 02:11:54.261]  So it's so important to pre-order the Obama Deception today, and don't wait, we've got all these other films we're carrying, like Eye of the Phoenix, Part 3 of America's Secret Beginnings, just an amazing film available at InfoWars.com, Endgame, Terror Storm, all of them.
[02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:56.443]  We're joined by Representative Dan Itza.
[02:11:57.859 --> 02:12:08.269]  Who is one of the sponsors, in fact his name is listed as first on the bill so I guess he must have been the one that introduced it and wrote it, the state of New Hampshire
[02:12:10.077 --> 02:12:11.317]  Well, I'm very proud to
[02:12:37.952 --> 02:12:42.953]  I want to make sure that I'm perfectly clear about one thing.
[02:12:42.953 --> 02:12:47.195]  The objective of this resolution is not secession.
[02:12:47.195 --> 02:12:56.497]  The objective, the happiest resolution of this resolution, would be a revitalized union within the confines of the Constitution.
[02:12:56.497 --> 02:13:03.779]  That said, if the general government should choose to aggress in a manner that nullifies the Constitution,
[02:13:04.324 --> 02:13:08.387]  It is impossible to secede from something that doesn't exist.
[02:13:08.387 --> 02:13:19.814]  And the preceding language, which does talk about essentially nullification of the Constitution, is not my language.
[02:13:19.814 --> 02:13:23.917]  Those are Thomas Jefferson's words.
[02:13:23.917 --> 02:13:24.777]  Well, I understand.
[02:13:24.777 --> 02:13:30.061]  When the government becomes destructive of the aims of the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, it is null and void.
[02:13:30.061 --> 02:13:32.622]  It is not just a right, it is a duty to
[02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:36.975]  Break it up and reform it.
[02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:37.556]  So please, sir...
[02:13:39.934 --> 02:13:41.675]  What made you write this legislation?
[02:13:41.675 --> 02:13:43.935]  What made you put Thomas Jefferson's words in there?
[02:13:43.935 --> 02:13:46.536]  I thought I recognized them.
[02:13:46.536 --> 02:13:53.559]  And now this is really igniting a bushfire across the country, because we are seeing not just a federal takeover.
[02:13:53.559 --> 02:14:00.241]  Time Magazine, in an article titled, The New World Order, last week said, a foreign global bank will control the U.S.
[02:14:00.241 --> 02:14:02.721]  government and everything we do in the United States.
[02:14:02.721 --> 02:14:07.103]  So we're trying to head off an offshore banking takeover of the United States.
[02:14:07.893 --> 02:14:12.155]  Absolutely, and many other things.
[02:14:12.155 --> 02:14:13.396]  What inspired me?
[02:14:13.396 --> 02:14:17.798]  Well, I mean, this isn't something new on my agenda.
[02:14:17.798 --> 02:14:26.302]  I submitted a resolution calling for the repeal of the odious portions of the Patriot Act in, I think, 2003.
[02:14:26.302 --> 02:14:35.107]  I submitted a resolution last year, which was last term, declaring that anything like the North American Union would be unconstitutional.
[02:14:36.496 --> 02:14:54.826]  But then this summer, when I was studying for my role as James Madison in the National Heritage Center for Constitutional Studies skit that we do every year, I came across the Kentucky Resolutions.
[02:14:54.826 --> 02:15:01.550]  And they are just such a perfect, perfect statement of all the principles involved.
[02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:05.432]  I knew that I had to take them and incorporate them into a resolution.
[02:15:06.164 --> 02:15:10.426]  And then give that resolution some objective.
[02:15:10.426 --> 02:15:13.928]  Are you talking about the Kentucky Resolution from 96 against the U.N.
[02:15:13.928 --> 02:15:16.029]  takeover of national parks?
[02:15:16.029 --> 02:15:19.611]  No, I'm talking about the Kentucky Resolution of 1798.
[02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:20.651]  Yes.
[02:15:20.651 --> 02:15:26.114]  Against the Alien and Sedition Act, which were the 18th century version of the Patriot Act.
[02:15:26.114 --> 02:15:27.835]  Yes, okay.
[02:15:27.835 --> 02:15:32.557]  Okay, so this goes right back to the foundations of our government.
[02:15:33.475 --> 02:15:36.657]  Jefferson wrote it and submitted it to Kentucky.
[02:15:36.657 --> 02:15:46.083]  He had James Madison submit it to Virginia, which Madison wouldn't have done if he didn't endorse the principles enumerated.
[02:15:46.083 --> 02:15:58.350]  So you've got the gentleman who drafted the Declaration of Independence and the gentleman who drafted the Constitution for the United States of America and its first ten amendments.
[02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:59.371]  These are their principles.
[02:15:59.371 --> 02:16:02.733]  These are how they saw the relationship between the states and the general government.
[02:16:03.345 --> 02:16:07.167]  The general government is not the exclusive or final judge of the Constitution.
[02:16:07.167 --> 02:16:11.170]  The states are, representing the people.
[02:16:11.170 --> 02:16:27.079]  Sir, and that's because the central government can be taken over by outside or corrupt forces within, and so the states are obviously... Well, it's because the states are the parties to the Compact, and to allow the general government
[02:16:27.642 --> 02:16:38.071]  To be the exclusive or final judge of its delegated powers and those it might delegate to itself is to make its discretion and not the Constitution the measure of its power.
[02:16:40.390 --> 02:16:56.924]  Representative, let's go through the illegal activities, the unconstitutional activities of the federal government that is exploding right now, and then what your piece of legislation, H.C.R.
[02:16:56.924 --> 02:17:02.949]  6, is stating, and the ultimatum that the state is laying out here.
[02:17:06.277 --> 02:17:28.928]  I don't have it open before me, so you probably do, and you can correct me if I misstate, but the first one deals with the making of martial law or a state of emergency in any, not just ours, but any of the states, because that certainly violates the guarantee of a Republican form of government.
[02:17:30.238 --> 02:17:36.199]  You have to have the consent of that state's legislature to do so, expressing the will of the people.
[02:17:36.199 --> 02:17:42.401]  The second one is involuntary servitude other than a draft during a time of war.
[02:17:42.401 --> 02:17:48.242]  In fact, there are good constitutional arguments against a draft because it would deprive the states of their militia.
[02:17:54.659 --> 02:18:02.324]  Servitude other than as a consequence of due process law and an alternative to incarceration.
[02:18:02.324 --> 02:18:10.909]  Any involuntary servitude of someone under the age of 18.
[02:18:10.909 --> 02:18:19.294]  Any further infringements on freedom of the press, speech, religion, or any infringement on religion.
[02:18:19.294 --> 02:18:20.775]  Any expansion
[02:18:21.634 --> 02:18:29.736]  Of prohibitions on the types of firearms, or quantity, or types of ammunition that might be owned, a.k.a.
[02:18:29.736 --> 02:18:30.696]  H.R.
[02:18:30.696 --> 02:18:33.237]  45.
[02:18:33.237 --> 02:18:43.859]  All of these things violate the fundamental maxims that are enumerated in our Constitution, both in the Bill of Rights and in the main body itself.
[02:18:43.859 --> 02:18:45.460]  And they are treason, are they not?
[02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:47.300]  This is treason!
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:48.300]  Absolutely.
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:50.221]  And, you know, once you
[02:18:51.946 --> 02:19:05.819]  You know, if you're in a divorce and you're in a marriage that is rocking and cruising for divorce, you don't just show up one day, or it's not right to just show up one day and hand divorce papers.
[02:19:05.819 --> 02:19:10.523]  You're obligated to go to that other person and say, look, we've got problems.
[02:19:10.523 --> 02:19:12.865]  We need to go to counseling.
[02:19:12.865 --> 02:19:16.248]  If you do this again, if you hit me again, this is over.
[02:19:18.678 --> 02:19:20.378]  This is that notice.
[02:19:20.378 --> 02:19:22.079]  It is the line in the fan thing.
[02:19:22.079 --> 02:19:26.440]  Now, we've tolerated the intolerable for some time now, but you know what?
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:30.601]  We're not going to tolerate it anymore, and if you do it again, you will have crossed the line.
[02:19:30.601 --> 02:19:33.842]  If you're dealing with a bully, you don't draw the line behind the bully.
[02:19:33.842 --> 02:19:37.983]  You draw the line between yourself and the bully.
[02:19:37.983 --> 02:19:40.444]  So, that's what this is.
[02:19:40.444 --> 02:19:42.204]  This is the line in the fan.
[02:19:42.204 --> 02:19:43.085]  Representative, stay there.
[02:19:43.085 --> 02:19:45.765]  I want you to repeat that when we come back, as we're going into break.
[02:19:45.765 --> 02:19:46.826]  Finish up with your comments.
[02:19:48.874 --> 02:19:58.655]  I've had other state reps on, I want to see if you're aware, I'm sure you are, you sound very informed, about PDD 51 and other things, because they're definitely making their move.
[02:20:01.653 --> 02:20:05.776]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:20:05.776 --> 02:20:18.485]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:18.485 --> 02:20:18.925]  The U.S.
[02:20:18.925 --> 02:20:24.909]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:24.909 --> 02:20:27.131]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:28.972 --> 02:20:30.073]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:20:30.073 --> 02:20:33.036]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:20:33.036 --> 02:20:38.961]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:20:39.485 --> 02:20:42.906]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:20:42.906 --> 02:20:49.809]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:20:49.809 --> 02:20:53.931]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:20:53.931 --> 02:20:54.151]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:54.151 --> 02:20:54.351]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:08.125]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.125 --> 02:21:10.767]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.767 --> 02:21:12.328]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.328 --> 02:21:13.128]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.128 --> 02:21:14.069]  This is his ammo.
[02:21:14.069 --> 02:21:15.470]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.470 --> 02:21:17.491]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.491 --> 02:21:24.636]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.636 --> 02:21:25.117]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.117 --> 02:21:30.741]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.441 --> 02:21:34.944]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:34.944 --> 02:21:37.106]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:02.648 --> 02:22:04.809]  Your engine is the heart of your vehicle.
[02:22:04.809 --> 02:22:08.110]  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to determine whether it's going to go the long run?
[02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:11.452]  Or should you dump your vehicle before you experience a major expense?
[02:22:11.452 --> 02:22:15.893]  The military has developed such a technology, and it's called Oil Analysis.
[02:22:15.893 --> 02:22:24.117]  By taking a mere 4-ounce sample during an oil change, you can get an easy-to-read, complete report by an independent laboratory covering engine wear,
[02:22:24.477 --> 02:22:26.258]  Oil Condition and Contamination
[02:22:54.397 --> 02:22:55.037]  We're good to go.
[02:23:14.987 --> 02:23:17.449]  Nature's Gem Premium Omega-3.

[02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:56.030]  Free shipping included.
[02:24:05.774 --> 02:24:13.658]  By the way, we started about a month ago really hammering this issue of the states and more of them declaring independence.
[02:24:13.658 --> 02:24:15.599]  Coast to Coast AM had me on a few days ago.
[02:24:15.599 --> 02:24:17.620]  Glenn Beck monitors that show and this show.
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:21.923]  He's going to have Representative Itza on his show tonight.
[02:24:21.923 --> 02:24:24.244]  He's leaving in about 30 minutes to go be on that show.
[02:24:28.257 --> 02:24:33.862]  So vital what you get out of this show, sir, with all the Fox News folks that don't know what's happening.
[02:24:33.862 --> 02:24:37.385]  And I'm going to be on Coast to Coast three hours next Monday with a bunch of other state reps.
[02:24:37.385 --> 02:24:43.471]  So thanks to you, the listeners, spreading the word, this is now becoming a major national story.
[02:24:43.471 --> 02:24:46.514]  And we don't have a hope.
[02:24:46.514 --> 02:24:48.475]  The federal government is taking over right now.
[02:24:49.656 --> 02:24:57.438]  FEMA camps, FEMA camp legislation, mass arrest, mass inoculation news, youth brigades.
[02:24:57.438 --> 02:25:03.500]  Representative Dan, please continue with what you were saying.
[02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:05.700]  You filed this before Obama was even in office.
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.101]  That's key.
[02:25:07.101 --> 02:25:08.361]  Right.
[02:25:08.361 --> 02:25:11.242]  I filed it last September.
[02:25:11.242 --> 02:25:14.343]  I crafted it last July and August.
[02:25:16.175 --> 02:25:18.897]  So, to me, this is not a new idea.
[02:25:18.897 --> 02:25:21.198]  This is vital for our times.
[02:25:21.198 --> 02:25:25.741]  It didn't matter to me whether it was Barack Obama or John McCain that would be elected.
[02:25:25.741 --> 02:25:29.784]  I saw the same handwriting on the wall.
[02:25:29.784 --> 02:25:33.747]  So now, it is time for the states to assert themselves.
[02:25:33.747 --> 02:25:42.072]  There is no way that we are going to take back the general government in one giant gulp.
[02:25:42.072 --> 02:25:44.234]  If we have any hope at all, it's to take it back.
[02:25:45.331 --> 02:25:49.733]  One bite at a time, 50 small bites.
[02:25:49.733 --> 02:26:07.599]  And it's important that the people know that the selection of their representatives at the state level is far more important than their selection at the federal level, because their state representatives and executives are far more dangerous to them.
[02:26:07.599 --> 02:26:11.140]  We can reach far deeper into their pockets and their households.
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:14.741]  But we are also their only defense against the general government.
[02:26:16.324 --> 02:26:20.347]  Um, and against the overreach of the federal government.
[02:26:20.347 --> 02:26:26.892]  And we have to now make this line in the sand and say, no, you cannot violate the Constitution.
[02:26:26.892 --> 02:26:29.293]  If you do, you have no authority here.
[02:26:29.293 --> 02:26:36.939]  And for instance, uh, if some of these things become law, um, and I should clarify that.
[02:26:36.939 --> 02:26:41.942]  Think of things like HR 45, which is the federal gun license bill.
[02:26:41.942 --> 02:26:43.924]  Notice I said HR, not HB.
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:49.784]  HB, or House Bill, refers to public law.
[02:26:49.784 --> 02:26:56.550]  HR refers to a resolution which is defined as a communication and constitutes private law.
[02:26:56.550 --> 02:27:01.834]  So it is entered into by an agreement with the two parties, all these grants that we get.
[02:27:02.273 --> 02:27:06.234]  You agree to get the money, and in return you abide by these rules for that money.
[02:27:06.234 --> 02:27:11.675]  Yeah, it's federalizing the state laws for psychological testing, registration.
[02:27:11.675 --> 02:27:17.837]  They've got other bills to ban all semi-autos, or to allow the Attorney General to ban anything at will.
[02:27:17.837 --> 02:27:22.158]  They're also saying they're going to put gun owners on no-fly lists just to ban you from buying guns.
[02:27:22.158 --> 02:27:23.658]  I mean, they're coming after us.
[02:27:23.658 --> 02:27:25.478]  They're not playing games.
[02:27:25.478 --> 02:27:27.759]  Remember, these are resolutions.
[02:27:27.759 --> 02:27:31.720]  So, it is perfectly legitimate for any state to say
[02:27:32.811 --> 02:27:35.992]  That resolution is not valid within our state.
[02:27:35.992 --> 02:27:41.653]  And anybody who attempts to enforce it, we will arrest and prosecute.
[02:27:41.653 --> 02:27:43.274]  Do what you will.
[02:27:43.274 --> 02:27:45.494]  And that's what your bill is saying.
[02:27:45.494 --> 02:27:47.735]  Explain how you will prosecute.
[02:27:47.735 --> 02:27:49.095]  Flesh that out.
[02:27:49.095 --> 02:28:02.238]  Well, you just, if they were, if they enact a federal gun license, and they attempt to enforce it, we say anybody who enforces it is committing, or attempts to enforce it, is committing a misdemeanor A, for instance.
[02:28:02.867 --> 02:28:05.148]  Which includes jail time.
[02:28:05.148 --> 02:28:07.450]  And we will prosecute them.
[02:28:07.450 --> 02:28:13.533]  And we create another resolution informing the federal government that we've done it.
[02:28:13.533 --> 02:28:14.894]  Let them spit on that and smoke it.
[02:28:16.109 --> 02:28:22.535]  Yeah, and they're trying to bill Obama as Lincoln, and he says he's going to keep the union together.
[02:28:22.535 --> 02:28:25.277]  We know the feds are concerned about the states rebelling.
[02:28:25.277 --> 02:28:27.620]  They know that the people are upset.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:35.647]  80% against the war, 99% against the North American Union in polls, 99% against the bailout in polls, 98% depending on the poll.
[02:28:35.647 --> 02:28:39.290]  Maybe he is Lincoln.
[02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:40.932]  What was the result of the Civil War?
[02:28:41.505 --> 02:28:44.007]  What happened at the end of the Civil War?
[02:28:44.007 --> 02:28:47.270]  Reconstruction, federal control, mass slaughter.
[02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:53.015]  One step before that, there was forced repatriation of the Southerners.
[02:28:53.015 --> 02:28:57.839]  People were repatriated at the point of a gun.
[02:28:57.839 --> 02:29:02.763]  That is the end of government by consent.
[02:29:02.763 --> 02:29:03.363]  That's right.
[02:29:03.363 --> 02:29:04.724]  That was breaking the back of the stage.
[02:29:04.724 --> 02:29:07.967]  That's why the new order loves him so much.
[02:29:07.967 --> 02:29:08.568]  My point is...
[02:29:11.808 --> 02:29:13.730]  What does the 14th Amendment do?
[02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:22.618]  It makes us, it presumes to make us, or it has been construed to make us federal citizens before we are state citizens.
[02:29:22.618 --> 02:29:27.323]  And it has replaced, you know, in freeing the slaves we made everyone a slave.
[02:29:31.107 --> 02:29:37.172]  And it turns a right into a privilege granted by the Roman civil government, going back to the Roman model.
[02:29:37.172 --> 02:29:38.233]  Stay there, sir.
[02:29:38.233 --> 02:29:41.756]  Wow, what an impressive state representative, so informed.
[02:29:41.756 --> 02:29:43.317]  Well, look what they're introducing.
[02:29:43.317 --> 02:29:44.257]  These are great men and women.
[02:29:44.257 --> 02:29:44.958]  Stay there.
[02:29:44.958 --> 02:29:51.803]  We're going to have you on with the other state rep, Ingbertson, as well, when we come back from New Hampshire.
[02:29:51.803 --> 02:29:53.205]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.205 --> 02:29:55.727]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.727 --> 02:29:58.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.795 --> 02:30:12.365]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:30:12.365 --> 02:30:13.787]  Garden in a Can!
[02:30:13.787 --> 02:30:17.931]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.

[02:30:19.953 --> 02:30:22.235]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[02:30:32.381 --> 02:30:33.802]  Garden in a can.
[02:30:33.802 --> 02:30:35.002]  It's that simple.
[02:30:35.002 --> 02:30:35.703]  Fresh.
[02:30:35.703 --> 02:30:36.563]  Healthy.
[02:30:36.563 --> 02:30:37.404]  Easy.
[02:30:37.404 --> 02:30:41.746]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:30:41.746 --> 02:30:42.627]  Ready when you are.

[02:31:01.037 --> 02:31:06.762]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:31:06.762 --> 02:31:07.982]  And we knew what to do.
[02:31:07.982 --> 02:31:10.084]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:31:10.084 --> 02:31:11.745]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[02:31:12.935 --> 02:31:17.122]  It finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:31:17.122 --> 02:31:25.637]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:31:26.001 --> 02:31:33.108]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:33.108 --> 02:31:36.270]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:31:36.270 --> 02:31:42.056]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:31:42.056 --> 02:31:45.139]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:31:45.139 --> 02:31:52.005]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[02:31:54.807 --> 02:31:55.128]  We're good to go.
[02:32:01.079 --> 02:32:06.580]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:07.380]  and the world.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.241]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:32:11.241 --> 02:32:17.742]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:32:17.742 --> 02:32:19.763]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:32:19.763 --> 02:32:27.704]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[02:32:38.515 --> 02:32:40.677]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[02:33:08.015 --> 02:33:16.601]  Alright, we are back live, finishing up with Representative Dan Itza, who introduced the bill in New Hampshire.
[02:33:16.601 --> 02:33:21.964]  He's going to be on Glenn Beck tonight, hopefully on Coast to Coast AM next Monday, if he'll do it.
[02:33:21.964 --> 02:33:25.206]  Coast to Coast asked me to give him his number.
[02:33:25.206 --> 02:33:28.989]  I'll be on there with myself, riding shotgun with George Norrie.
[02:33:28.989 --> 02:33:36.274]  And then we've got Representative Paul Ingbrudson, who's also a sponsor, who's been listening to the show.
[02:33:37.628 --> 02:33:38.629]  Glad to have him on board.
[02:33:38.629 --> 02:33:41.392]  Gonna go to him in just a moment.
[02:33:41.392 --> 02:33:54.905]  Finishing up the point you were making before the break, PDD 51, signed by Bush last year, said that in any emergency, the Congress has no authority, the executive rules all.
[02:33:57.729 --> 02:34:19.803]  In the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it states that they are preparing to engage the states, the American people, and now the Army War College has announced, and it's a Defense Department statement, four months old, it's been all over the news, 20,000 combat troops, and it says the governors will serve at the pleasure of the president, the state guards are being brought unto the federal government,
[02:34:21.898 --> 02:34:27.741]  And that if the president so chooses, the governor will serve as a dual-hatted federal officer.
[02:34:27.741 --> 02:34:31.042]  I mean, this is blasphemy to the Tenth Amendment.
[02:34:31.042 --> 02:34:39.005]  This is exactly what they did with Lincoln after the Civil War, during Reconstruction, putting in puppet governors.
[02:34:39.005 --> 02:34:42.747]  It's what the British did that caused 1775 and six.
[02:34:42.747 --> 02:34:44.528]  So I've set the table with that, sir.
[02:34:44.528 --> 02:34:48.569]  Can you, in your own words, A. Are you aware of all those nightmares, and B.
[02:34:49.935 --> 02:34:53.718]  If not, I hope you research it fast before you go on Glenn Beck, because it's real.
[02:34:53.718 --> 02:34:57.461]  Knowing that, what does that say?
[02:34:57.461 --> 02:34:59.302]  No.
[02:34:59.302 --> 02:35:13.534]  Though it doesn't surprise me, I guess one of the greatest travesties and mistakes we ever made was to change the title of our Chief Executive from President to Governor in 1792.
[02:35:13.534 --> 02:35:17.036]  Because that would have made the duality more apparent.
[02:35:19.668 --> 02:35:26.293]  Unfortunately, at that time, we foolishly put our trust in the federal government.
[02:35:26.293 --> 02:35:36.721]  And it's surprising that we did, because we were actually very demeritist about ratifying the Constitution.
[02:35:36.721 --> 02:35:42.805]  We were the ninth one to do so, and it almost didn't pass in New Hampshire.
[02:35:42.805 --> 02:35:47.869]  It actually, you know, the area that I represent was anti-federalist.
[02:35:50.117 --> 02:35:55.001]  Well, let me, because you're so informed on the other issues, more informed than I am, I'm sure, in many.
[02:35:55.001 --> 02:36:06.730]  Let me just give you Presidential Decision Directive 51, John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, passed concurrently each year in the defense budget.
[02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:13.575]  And then, I mean, did you, I'm sure you heard about the 20,000 combat troops and... Oh, I'm aware of that one.
[02:36:14.951 --> 02:36:23.998]  But, you know, the idea that anybody could declare that the executive is superior to the legislature is patently unconstitutional.
[02:36:23.998 --> 02:36:39.009]  There's a reason why, you know, there's so much devoted to the legislature in Article 1, a lesser amount to the executive in Article 2, and a scant amount to the judiciary in Article 3.
[02:36:39.009 --> 02:36:42.692]  It's because the legislature is the supreme branch of government.
[02:36:44.025 --> 02:36:44.445]  That's right.
[02:36:44.445 --> 02:36:49.806]  First, they lied to us in the last hundred years and said they were co-equal, but I've read the anti-federalist and federalist papers.
[02:36:49.806 --> 02:36:58.848]  The legislature, because it comprises the greatest number of separated powers derived from the people, and is the hardest to take over with a tyranny, it is supreme.
[02:36:58.848 --> 02:37:04.009]  But instead, PDD 51 says you ain't nothing.
[02:37:04.009 --> 02:37:05.550]  It's the president.
[02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:08.870]  Well, then that's a lie.
[02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:11.731]  I mean, you know, you don't have to
[02:37:12.501 --> 02:37:18.787]  Adhere or recognize or reverence a lie.
[02:37:18.787 --> 02:37:28.135]  The judicial decision that has given the judiciary supremacy is actually a New Hampshire judicial decision from 1819.
[02:37:28.135 --> 02:37:33.119]  And everybody has been bowing to it ever since.
[02:37:33.119 --> 02:37:38.483]  But if you analyze the decision, the decision itself is a lie.
[02:37:38.483 --> 02:37:40.145]  It's a misrepresentation of the fact.
[02:37:42.518 --> 02:37:54.621]  Sir, is the federal government, Representative, is the federal government completely morally bankrupt now and illegitimate?
[02:37:54.621 --> 02:37:56.922]  I don't know that I would go that far.
[02:37:56.922 --> 02:38:00.563]  I mean, is the federal government itself fundamentally illegitimate?
[02:38:00.563 --> 02:38:01.063]  No.
[02:38:01.063 --> 02:38:03.043]  Are many of its acts illegitimate?
[02:38:03.043 --> 02:38:03.304]  Yes.
[02:38:03.304 --> 02:38:05.104]  I mean, you have to separate the two.
[02:38:05.104 --> 02:38:07.845]  It's like separating, you know, the thin from the thinner.
[02:38:10.177 --> 02:38:28.100]  There is a constitution to which we agreed that establishes a general government for purposes of external affairs and mediation between the states.
[02:38:29.676 --> 02:38:31.576]  I mean, that's his purpose.
[02:38:31.576 --> 02:38:34.097]  But Representative, that is the meat of the issue.
[02:38:34.097 --> 02:38:54.582]  By signing Bretton Woods II and international agreements to cede final authority over major commerce and banking to an offshore bank that will control the United States and to have NORTHCOM taking over the states, that is fully breaking the compact and a new form of government, tyrannous, is being perfected.
[02:38:56.272 --> 02:38:58.733]  And we didn't stand up to it at the time.
[02:38:58.733 --> 02:39:12.876]  That is the importance of something like HCR 6 coming from each of the states, notifying them that further acts of this type are intolerable and constitute a nullification of the Constitution.
[02:39:12.876 --> 02:39:17.037]  You don't just hit somebody out of the blue.
[02:39:17.037 --> 02:39:21.238]  That's why there was an Olive Branch petition and a Declaration of Independence.
[02:39:21.238 --> 02:39:24.499]  And, you know, when the War for Independence started,
[02:39:26.275 --> 02:39:33.561]  It was not something that the colonists wanted.
[02:39:33.561 --> 02:39:46.232]  If you look at New Hampshire's first constitution in January of 1776, prior to the Declaration of Independence, it was established because the governor quit the state.
[02:39:46.232 --> 02:39:49.434]  He left, got in a little rowboat and went out to sea.
[02:39:49.434 --> 02:39:53.117]  Got on a big boat and went back over to England.
[02:39:53.117 --> 02:39:55.139]  And we said, my God, we don't have a government.
[02:39:56.026 --> 02:39:57.713]  And so we established one.
[02:39:57.713 --> 02:40:00.786]  But the introductory paragraph say...
[02:40:01.229 --> 02:40:05.570]  This is a temporary constitution until we can be reunited with Great Britain.
[02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:08.050]  There was no desire... No, I understand.
[02:40:08.050 --> 02:40:11.051]  Nobody wants war, but you know what Patrick Henry said.
[02:40:11.051 --> 02:40:14.091]  You can hear the clash of arms in the North.
[02:40:14.091 --> 02:40:15.672]  Why stand we here idle?
[02:40:15.672 --> 02:40:18.132]  I agree to avert physical confrontation.
[02:40:18.132 --> 02:40:23.873]  We need to get the word out, though, that great tyranny is upon us.
[02:40:23.873 --> 02:40:25.413]  I want to be fair to the next state representative.
[02:40:25.413 --> 02:40:28.474]  Stay there, though, sir, and comment on what he has to say.
[02:40:28.474 --> 02:40:29.374]  We're compatriots.
[02:40:29.374 --> 02:40:29.774]  We're buddies.
[02:40:30.194 --> 02:40:35.218]  Okay, let's bring in Representative Ingbertson.
[02:40:35.218 --> 02:40:37.540]  Paul Ingbertson joins us from New Hampshire as well.
[02:40:37.540 --> 02:40:45.247]  He's co-signatory to this bill that's been put together by Congressman Itza.
[02:40:45.247 --> 02:40:46.908]  You've been hearing what we've been discussing, sir.
[02:40:46.908 --> 02:40:49.590]  Your comments on what's going on?
[02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:54.134]  Well, first, Alex, I want to thank you for what you're trying to do nationwide.
[02:40:54.134 --> 02:40:57.257]  I heard, I saw you many years ago, I think when you first started up.
[02:40:57.861 --> 02:41:02.302]  I want to congratulate you on the education you've given yourself over the course of these years.
[02:41:02.302 --> 02:41:03.943]  Thank you.
[02:41:03.943 --> 02:41:13.746]  I thought, boy, you did learn a few things, and I'm extremely impressed with where you've gotten, and you are doing a tremendous service to the cause of freedom.
[02:41:13.746 --> 02:41:14.527]  I really honor you.
[02:41:14.527 --> 02:41:15.647]  Thank you very much for having me on.
[02:41:16.052 --> 02:41:17.333]  Well, thank you, Paul.
[02:41:17.333 --> 02:41:18.854]  We all learn.
[02:41:18.854 --> 02:41:27.921]  I think the biggest thing is I was silly and ignorant, but I had guts and guts was enough, and you guys aren't silly and ignorant, and you've got guts, so it's great.
[02:41:27.921 --> 02:41:28.942]  Tell us what's happening here.
[02:41:28.942 --> 02:41:30.563]  I mean, this is history.
[02:41:30.563 --> 02:41:41.011]  Well, I can just give you my view, and the reason I signed on, I think, with you, that we're way past the point of tolerating.
[02:41:41.011 --> 02:41:43.753]  We're actually abetting now, as states.
[02:41:44.502 --> 02:41:45.863]  This stuff has gone on so long.
[02:41:45.863 --> 02:41:59.130]  You know, I'm looking at the line in the Declaration of Independence, a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all obviously by this point having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
[02:41:59.130 --> 02:42:03.312]  And what was the conclusion of that statement at the Declaration of Independence?
[02:42:03.312 --> 02:42:08.335]  We have no choice, in my opinion at this point, to start looking toward dissolving this government.
[02:42:08.335 --> 02:42:12.377]  And since they're starting to see this, and they know this is happening, and since they know it will happen,
[02:42:12.987 --> 02:42:23.310]  When they begin to bring the tyrannical laws and that sort of thing, they're trying to preempt it.
[02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:28.352]  And so bills like this are critical, Dan is correct, you have to.
[02:42:28.352 --> 02:42:34.794]  The last thing any of us want to see is blood, even though Jefferson believed it was the only way to ever keep our freedoms.
[02:42:35.632 --> 02:42:39.497]  But knowing people like this, but know that he's doing the right thing.
[02:42:39.497 --> 02:42:51.211]  We're trying to figure out a way to get the states back to conversation with each other and then to get us all looking simultaneously at the federal government and saying, what is this monster we've created and what should we do about it?
[02:42:53.012 --> 02:43:09.724]  Absolutely, and my central point here is, studying the federal government and what the military was preparing, what the Pentagon has been saying for decades, they have always known that the main legitimate threat to them was the states, and they have been trying to quietly federalize
[02:43:10.464 --> 02:43:12.866]  Federally take over the counties and the cities.
[02:43:12.866 --> 02:43:14.908]  And as you said, it's very, very dark.
[02:43:14.908 --> 02:43:16.990]  It's past midnight.
[02:43:16.990 --> 02:43:18.771]  The tyranny is here.
[02:43:18.771 --> 02:43:26.058]  And if enough of a buzz is created and the people stand up and say no through their states, we may be able to avert this and back it off.
[02:43:26.058 --> 02:43:29.261]  I mean, when we look at Madoff, founder of the Nasdaq, stealing
[02:43:30.021 --> 02:43:32.342]  50 to 100 billion and not even getting in trouble.
[02:43:32.342 --> 02:43:39.986]  When we look at the very bankers that have stolen trillions now running the White House, Bush had them running the White House, they come in with Obama.
[02:43:39.986 --> 02:43:46.109]  I mean, it's clearly a completely bankrupt, illegitimate group of criminals that have hijacked the federal government.
[02:43:46.109 --> 02:43:51.092]  So how do we get them out of there and then get our republic back?
[02:43:51.092 --> 02:43:53.593]  Your comments on that, Representative?
[02:43:53.593 --> 02:43:58.876]  Yes, well, you know, this is the first part of this correspondence that is being recommended in this resolution.
[02:43:59.343 --> 02:44:03.964]  The states have to begin to open up dialogue with each other and analyze the problem.
[02:44:03.964 --> 02:44:06.705]  We have to do this systematically, and we have to do it now.
[02:44:06.705 --> 02:44:07.445]  It's way past time.
[02:44:07.445 --> 02:44:08.146]  We are the authority.
[02:44:08.146 --> 02:44:14.968]  The first thing that happened to us that really started this problem was the loss of the representation by the states and the federal government.
[02:44:14.968 --> 02:44:17.329]  The states now no longer have representation.
[02:44:17.329 --> 02:44:21.850]  We have representatives elected by popular, but not by the states' bodies themselves.
[02:44:21.850 --> 02:44:28.492]  There's no corporate representation, and that's why actions like this don't seem to make sense to a lot of people in the state houses.
[02:44:28.939 --> 02:44:33.680]  But the first part is to get back to a conversation with the states, talking to the states.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:44.702]  Well, we see through federalism they're creating regional governments in the states that bypass state authority, and the states seem to think it's free federal money when it was state money to begin with.
[02:44:44.702 --> 02:44:50.563]  I'd like to get a comment from the author of the bill, Representative Dan Itza.
[02:44:50.563 --> 02:44:56.744]  It's time to stop bribing me with my own money.
[02:44:56.744 --> 02:44:57.504]  This is like
[02:44:59.223 --> 02:45:12.253]  Uh... parents who created a child known as the the general government and left it disciplined for so long that it has become an incorrigible child.
[02:45:12.253 --> 02:45:16.896]  And it's time for the parents to take the child to the woodshed.
[02:45:16.896 --> 02:45:19.798]  That's terrific!
[02:45:19.798 --> 02:45:20.339]  It's true!
[02:45:20.339 --> 02:45:26.743]  I mean, we created this and now foreign bankers hijacked it and are telling us we're slaves?
[02:45:28.214 --> 02:45:34.878]  I sit on the Education Committee, and of course I have communications with my own school superintendents and that sort of thing.
[02:45:34.878 --> 02:45:38.800]  And, you know, the federal government has no role whatsoever in education, period.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:39.380]  There's no role.
[02:45:39.380 --> 02:45:41.241]  They have no... They should be... They can't tax for it.
[02:45:41.241 --> 02:45:43.602]  They can't pass laws about it.
[02:45:43.602 --> 02:45:47.485]  But instead, what they do is they raise these monies, and they get us tied to it.
[02:45:47.485 --> 02:45:49.966]  And then they come on with a bigger one, a bigger bite now.
[02:45:49.966 --> 02:45:53.768]  Now, no child left behind is the actual official takeover of public education in the schools.
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:56.361]  By the federal government.
[02:45:56.361 --> 02:45:58.401]  The whole package is absolutely outrageous.
[02:45:58.401 --> 02:46:07.024]  And now... And believe it or not, your local people believe that if we don't have the federal money, we're going to somehow go broke if they didn't get the stuff from us.
[02:46:07.024 --> 02:46:13.026]  And if they were not siphoning it off into their own pockets all the way along the way, we're only getting a tiny portion of it back anyway.
[02:46:13.467 --> 02:46:14.207]  It's a madness.
[02:46:14.207 --> 02:46:15.888]  It's almost beyond belief.
[02:46:15.888 --> 02:46:17.108]  Well, look at what they've done.
[02:46:17.108 --> 02:46:22.671]  Now they have, by federal law, if the states take the money, the army is in all the schools.
[02:46:22.671 --> 02:46:28.253]  They're threatening the children to arrest them if they don't sign up for the military, saying it's the law.
[02:46:28.253 --> 02:46:30.574]  That's on record everywhere.
[02:46:30.574 --> 02:46:34.155]  They are... Excuse me a moment.
[02:46:34.155 --> 02:46:35.596]  I mean... I mean, it is serious.
[02:46:35.596 --> 02:46:37.476]  Go ahead.
[02:46:37.476 --> 02:46:38.897]  Well... Yes, go ahead.
[02:46:38.897 --> 02:46:40.197]  Okay.
[02:46:40.197 --> 02:46:41.298]  Now, I'd like somebody...
[02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:44.674]  I thought somebody was trying to reach me, but apparently not.
[02:46:44.674 --> 02:46:46.477]  No, I understand you guys are in your offices and busy.
[02:46:48.354 --> 02:46:49.895]  Gentlemen, you've got the floor, both of you.
[02:46:49.895 --> 02:46:52.217]  I mean, have a dialogue about where this is going.
[02:46:52.217 --> 02:46:54.158]  People say, oh, we're not going to have the states pass this.
[02:46:54.158 --> 02:46:54.758]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[02:46:54.758 --> 02:47:00.302]  We'll just roll over and die then, because the nation's been seized by offshore banks.
[02:47:00.302 --> 02:47:14.512]  If the fires of liberty are lit, and in these times of adversity they are, we have a good chance of having a counter-revolution and taking our country back and restoring it against these globalists who are the real revolutionaries, the real hijackers.
[02:47:15.814 --> 02:47:18.215]  Well, that's an interesting point.
[02:47:18.215 --> 02:47:22.137]  One of my papers I write about the New World Order.
[02:47:22.137 --> 02:47:27.220]  The New World Order is what was created in 1776 for the New World.
[02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:34.244]  What we're gravitating back toward now is the Old World Order, European-style aristocracy.
[02:47:34.244 --> 02:47:44.029]  And it's time for us to hitch up our britches and, as Pastor Garrett Lear, the Patriot pastor, says, somebody's stolen my country and I want her back.
[02:47:46.048 --> 02:47:50.050]  And a further comment, by the way, this bill came into committee yesterday.
[02:47:50.050 --> 02:48:02.815]  I don't know if you knew about this, Alex, but the Federal State Relations Committee in New Hampshire's State House, and we'd had a count going on.
[02:48:02.815 --> 02:48:09.058]  We'd heard about the Democrats talking to each other and basically had almost uniformly agreed to go along with this bill.
[02:48:09.058 --> 02:48:15.261]  And with one exception that we knew of, the Republicans all were planning to vote for this bill.
[02:48:16.130 --> 02:48:22.013]  And an odd thing happened on the way to the forum, I guess you could say.
[02:48:22.013 --> 02:48:32.639]  But when the bill came up, it just turned out that the Speaker, who's a Democrat, was standing at the door of that committee as they voted.
[02:48:32.639 --> 02:48:34.680]  And the vote went the other way.
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:37.581]  We wound up with 11 to 7 against passage of this bill.
[02:48:37.581 --> 02:48:44.225]  I suggest to you that you're already on top of it, and that is that certain powers that be and certain establishment players
[02:48:45.225 --> 02:48:46.726]  Are part of the problem.
[02:48:46.726 --> 02:48:49.929]  And they're in the states, they're all over the place.
[02:48:49.929 --> 02:49:02.017]  And the interesting thing is when that, in preparation for that vote, you know, somebody makes the motion of inexpedient to legislate, which was the Vice Chair, and then there's discussion of the bill.
[02:49:02.017 --> 02:49:09.583]  There was not one stilling argument, I don't believe any argument, in favor of the motion of inexpedient to legislate.
[02:49:09.583 --> 02:49:12.625]  There were four arguments against it.
[02:49:12.625 --> 02:49:13.646]  And then the vote was taken.
[02:49:14.867 --> 02:49:22.071]  And without any rational support for the motion, it passed.
[02:49:22.071 --> 02:49:23.452]  And, Alex, that's what it's coming to.
[02:49:23.452 --> 02:49:24.813]  We've seen this in the last couple years.
[02:49:24.813 --> 02:49:26.314]  We've been a Republican House for a long time.
[02:49:26.314 --> 02:49:30.997]  The last two years, we're finding that we can stand up and argue the merits, argue the logic, argue everything.
[02:49:30.997 --> 02:49:35.940]  There's basically silence on the other side, and then the vote just goes socialist, as you could say.
[02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:37.721]  It just goes sideways.
[02:49:37.721 --> 02:49:41.123]  Yeah, they've spent decades setting this up.
[02:49:41.123 --> 02:49:42.084]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49:42.084 --> 02:49:43.785]  And they're now going for broke.
[02:49:44.955 --> 02:49:48.598]  And we're going to be reorganized.
[02:49:48.598 --> 02:49:52.862]  You know, the big international banks did this in the Soviet Union, they did it in Germany, they did it in China.
[02:49:52.862 --> 02:49:55.904]  It's all now declassified, and they're doing it here.
[02:49:55.904 --> 02:49:57.846]  And folks, I'm not playing games.
[02:49:57.846 --> 02:50:00.448]  We've shown you the documents, had the guests on.
[02:50:00.448 --> 02:50:05.012]  They plan to really gut this country and do some bad things.
[02:50:05.012 --> 02:50:07.034]  So many people, men, are going to
[02:50:09.002 --> 02:50:13.023]  If this goes bad, if we're unable to stop this, they're going to wish to God they'd have joined us.
[02:50:13.023 --> 02:50:23.326]  People who serve the evil, I think are just so cynical and lazy and only into their own personal bobbles that they don't understand that this is historic.
[02:50:23.326 --> 02:50:25.526]  This isn't just corruption as usual.
[02:50:25.526 --> 02:50:34.809]  Alex, we have, you know, as a support for that, we've been called by a number of shows, including some people who do radio shows, military individuals who do radio shows.
[02:50:35.270 --> 02:50:41.431]  There are people who are in all places in government and other places that do understand what's going on.
[02:50:41.431 --> 02:50:43.132]  Let's talk about that when we get back, gentlemen.
[02:50:43.132 --> 02:50:45.412]  If you could stay with me five more minutes after the break.
[02:50:45.412 --> 02:50:52.914]  We'll also want to give out your websites and contact information for people that want to join you or get the bill and try to get it passed in their state.
[02:50:52.914 --> 02:50:55.735]  The fight is ours and we'll take it up in our hands.
[02:50:55.735 --> 02:50:57.575]  Our destiny lies before us.
[02:51:02.344 --> 02:51:06.488]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[02:52:12.415 --> 02:52:13.215]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.215 --> 02:52:14.216]  This is his M.O.
[02:52:14.216 --> 02:52:15.576]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:15.576 --> 02:52:17.577]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:17.577 --> 02:52:24.720]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.

[02:52:25.200 --> 02:52:30.843]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:31.543 --> 02:52:35.424]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.424 --> 02:52:45.527]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[02:54:14.252 --> 02:54:19.874]  We have two great representatives on who I think can put together the best of all the states I've read.
[02:54:19.874 --> 02:54:20.275]  It's over 20 now.
[02:54:20.275 --> 02:54:32.279]  We're going to continue next week with more state representatives as we beat this drum to rise the people up from every hill and mountain, from every church top, from the lowlands to the seacoast, telling the people
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:36.068]  That 1776 is upon us, yet again!
[02:54:40.306 --> 02:54:47.649]  In closing with Representative Dan Hidsom and Representative Paul Ingbertson.
[02:54:47.649 --> 02:54:49.970]  Gentlemen, how do we help you get this done in New Hampshire?
[02:54:49.970 --> 02:54:52.071]  Contact the media, make them cover it.
[02:54:52.071 --> 02:54:54.872]  Looks like it's already starting to happen.
[02:54:54.872 --> 02:54:56.312]  How do we get other states to do this?
[02:54:56.312 --> 02:55:04.335]  I mean, as you said earlier, Representative Ingbertson, we need to educate the states, the city councils, the counties.
[02:55:04.335 --> 02:55:06.196]  I mean, really, it's education here, isn't it?
[02:55:08.394 --> 02:55:14.256]  The first thing is that everybody who's listening in New Hampshire needs to assail the government.
[02:55:14.256 --> 02:55:26.781]  They need to call their representatives, they need to call the leadership of both parties in the legislature, and let them know that they are demanding the defense of their liberty from the federal government.
[02:55:26.781 --> 02:55:34.444]  And there's going to be a rally at the statehouse the day that the vote is taken.
[02:55:34.444 --> 02:55:36.725]  Presumably right now that's March 4th.
[02:55:38.698 --> 02:55:40.999]  Okay, we need to get other rallies going around the country.
[02:55:40.999 --> 02:55:43.060]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters, listeners.
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:44.120]  Start the movement now.
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:46.281]  Call the state reps who have introduced it in your state.
[02:55:46.281 --> 02:55:48.562]  Tell them you want to set a rally and help them.
[02:55:48.562 --> 02:55:49.502]  Buy radio ads.
[02:55:49.502 --> 02:55:50.623]  Do whatever you've got to do.
[02:55:50.623 --> 02:55:52.883]  I'm going to Representative Ingbertson.
[02:55:52.883 --> 02:55:54.464]  Sir, should people call you guys?
[02:55:54.464 --> 02:55:55.824]  Should they contact you?
[02:55:55.824 --> 02:55:58.325]  I mean, how can we help?
[02:55:58.325 --> 02:56:02.827]  Well, I recommend they do that, but I think the more important thing is to call the reps.
[02:56:02.827 --> 02:56:03.427]  They're 400.
[02:56:03.427 --> 02:56:04.448]  Very easy to get all the addresses.
[02:56:04.448 --> 02:56:06.869]  You can mail to them simultaneously if you go to nh.gov.
[02:56:08.533 --> 02:56:10.294]  It's not hard to find that stuff.
[02:56:10.294 --> 02:56:12.275]  I'll tell you this for one reason and one reason only.
[02:56:12.275 --> 02:56:30.464]  I don't want people to be overwhelmed out there with this, but what we're getting in media here, and Dan can tell you more specifically, he had a contact yesterday with the Concord Monitor, I believe it was, Dan, you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong, where they simply said, what in the heck are you bothering this kind of crap for when we have real problems?
[02:56:30.464 --> 02:56:33.285]  And I'm telling you folks, that's the media you're talking about right now.
[02:56:33.285 --> 02:56:36.407]  You can't get any leverage with stuff like this because we have real problems.
[02:56:38.435 --> 02:56:43.396]  My point to Dan was, if this is a real problem, folks, I think I'm going to quit government.
[02:56:43.396 --> 02:56:44.216]  I don't even belong here.
[02:56:44.216 --> 02:56:47.918]  This is the most real and the most serious problem we've got facing us.
[02:56:47.918 --> 02:56:50.298]  Well, that's the point of the media's handling it around here.
[02:56:50.298 --> 02:56:54.860]  Anything they can do to become the media, these people out there with their phones and their emails and all that stuff,
[02:56:55.316 --> 02:56:57.057]  Anything they can do to become the media would be fine.
[02:56:57.057 --> 02:56:58.619]  I was about to say, that's the plan.
[02:56:58.619 --> 02:57:06.004]  As the Feds are bankrupting things by design, we have their own documents to then make everybody get on the government tit here.
[02:57:06.004 --> 02:57:08.586]  I mean, this is to sell us on an expanded wave.
[02:57:08.586 --> 02:57:10.128]  Go ahead.
[02:57:10.128 --> 02:57:15.612]  I'd like to read you something from Federalist Paper 46, written by James Madison.
[02:57:15.612 --> 02:57:24.559]  Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:45.857]  And by which the militia officers are appointed, forms the barrier against the enterprise of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of, notwithstanding the military establishments of the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear.
[02:57:45.857 --> 02:57:53.583]  The governments are afraid to trust the people with arms, and it is not certain that with this aid they would alone be able to shake off their yoke.
[02:57:54.574 --> 02:58:18.904]  But were the people to possess the additional advantage of local government, chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed, with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.
[02:58:18.904 --> 02:58:22.465]  Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with suspicion.
[02:58:22.884 --> 02:58:29.646]  That they would not be less able to defend the rights which they would be in actual possession.
[02:58:29.646 --> 02:58:29.786]  Amen.
[02:58:29.786 --> 02:58:31.326]  Alright, we are out of time.
[02:58:31.326 --> 02:58:35.227]  I want to have you both up again next week because I know you have more to say.
[02:58:35.227 --> 02:58:43.750]  So, to both of you representatives, Paul Ingbertson and to Dan Itza, thank you so much.
[02:58:43.750 --> 02:58:46.250]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:48.551]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.479 --> 02:58:53.160]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.160 --> 02:58:57.902]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.902 --> 02:59:00.863]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.863 --> 02:59:03.904]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.904 --> 02:59:08.626]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.846 --> 02:59:09.988]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.988 --> 02:59:13.232]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.232 --> 02:59:20.221]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.221 --> 02:59:23.506]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.506 --> 02:59:23.766]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:26.169 --> 02:59:28.630]  Or, on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:34.891]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.891 --> 02:59:38.652]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.652 --> 02:59:39.932]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:39.932 --> 02:59:40.632]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.632 --> 02:59:42.432]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.275 --> 02:59:56.637]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.637 --> 02:59:59.419]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:22.330 --> 03:00:24.012]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[03:00:24.012 --> 03:00:26.434]  I am congratulating all of you out there.
[03:00:26.434 --> 03:00:30.618]  For a month we've been covering the rebellion of the states against the tyranny.
[03:00:30.618 --> 03:00:34.742]  The federal government has been completely hijacked and is illegitimate.
[03:00:34.742 --> 03:00:40.087]  They are bringing in one of the most vicious tyrannies ever seen on record.
[03:00:40.087 --> 03:00:45.772]  Our worst analysis turned out to be less than what the truth was.
[03:00:45.772 --> 03:00:47.214]  It was far worse than we thought.
[03:00:48.402 --> 03:00:52.765]  These are the men, the time that try men and women's souls.
[03:00:52.765 --> 03:00:56.387]  And we just want to commend and thank all of you that are here and spreading the word.
[03:00:56.387 --> 03:01:01.470]  Because this issue of the states saying no to the globalists, this is the only hope we've got.
[03:01:01.470 --> 03:01:04.652]  They're bankrupting us by design to bring us into receivership.
[03:01:04.652 --> 03:01:07.713]  For the next hour he's going to be in the studio with us.
[03:01:07.713 --> 03:01:09.174]  George Humphrey, my good friend.
[03:01:09.174 --> 03:01:11.956]  I remember when I first started getting active in like 1995.
[03:01:14.232 --> 03:01:21.438]  And I remember I was running around volunteering for Pat Buchanan, because he was speaking out against the New World Order at the time.
[03:01:21.438 --> 03:01:24.120]  Love him or hate him, the point is we were just learning.
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:29.684]  And I went over to drop off a bunch of signs to another volunteer and it was at George Humphrey's house.
[03:01:29.684 --> 03:01:33.807]  And George, a former city council member, successful businessman, degreed economist,
[03:01:34.730 --> 03:01:38.033]  That's why we have him here today in studio with us after the show's over.
[03:01:38.033 --> 03:01:45.200]  It's the last interview we're doing for the Obama Deception because I want to insert him some into this film that you can already pre-order.
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:46.521]  It'll be done in a few weeks.
[03:01:46.521 --> 03:01:50.724]  Pre-order it now at InfoWars.com today.
[03:01:50.724 --> 03:01:51.585]  I hope that you will do that.
[03:01:54.670 --> 03:02:16.626]  I want you to recap what you said in that brief interview earlier this week when you were just here visiting, when you were on for ten minutes, and then let's go through where you see the future and the different divergent paths that the future can bring that we literally are the governors of if we simply take action and put our will into it.
[03:02:18.027 --> 03:02:19.488]  George Humphrey, great to have you here.
[03:02:19.488 --> 03:02:22.529]  First of all, I am so glad to be here.
[03:02:22.529 --> 03:02:28.852]  And Alex, what you are doing and what you've done in this last six months is just awesome.
[03:02:28.852 --> 03:02:31.773]  And what you've been doing for the last 15 years is just incredible.
[03:02:31.773 --> 03:02:37.215]  And it's been a real pleasure and honor to be your friend and ally in this period of time.
[03:02:37.215 --> 03:02:38.956]  I mean, you know what?
[03:02:38.956 --> 03:02:42.238]  When we first got involved in it, we were kind of scared we'd lose our friends.
[03:02:43.118 --> 03:02:47.804]  I just finished being a city council member and I was wanting to run for U.S.
[03:02:47.804 --> 03:02:52.650]  Congress and I said, God, if I talk about this stuff, I won't be able to run for Congress.
[03:02:52.650 --> 03:02:56.295]  And I went, well, what's more important, telling the truth or doing this?
[03:02:56.295 --> 03:02:57.437]  And so for the last 10, 12 years,
[03:03:00.427 --> 03:03:04.909]  There is a lot of ostracism, there's a lot of people who made fun, who derided us.
[03:03:04.909 --> 03:03:10.752]  You know, there goes Alex, there goes George, those are the crazy guys talking about the New World Order.
[03:03:10.752 --> 03:03:19.977]  But over and over and over, and especially this last four or five months, more and more and more people are coming up to me.
[03:03:19.977 --> 03:03:21.918]  I was just at Starbucks on the way here,
[03:03:22.551 --> 03:03:31.921]  Three folks, just as straight as they can be, you know, frat guys come up to me, aren't you the guy, da-da-da, and they knew all about your show and they had just become aware of this stuff.
[03:03:31.921 --> 03:03:37.266]  Everybody is becoming aware and information is the key.
[03:03:37.927 --> 03:03:39.128]  And that's what we're here to do.
[03:03:39.128 --> 03:03:41.270]  We don't have to pump anything up.
[03:03:41.270 --> 03:03:43.052]  There's so much information.
[03:03:43.052 --> 03:03:45.293]  This is not conspiracy theory.
[03:03:45.293 --> 03:03:50.938]  It's just the history of what's going on in our culture and what is happening right now.
[03:03:50.938 --> 03:03:53.501]  And we have a choice.
[03:03:53.501 --> 03:03:56.423]  And the first thing is to become educated.
[03:03:56.423 --> 03:04:01.868]  And clearly, clearly, clearly, our nation, our culture,
[03:04:03.522 --> 03:04:12.827]  is addicted to materialism, to the soft life, to a very unhealthy way of going through life.
[03:04:12.827 --> 03:04:32.318]  We've forgotten God, we've forgotten our families, and you know, just like in Alcoholics Anonymous, they talk about the different steps of denial, and derision, and of anger, and of fear, and of depression, and then finally, finally of acceptance.
[03:04:33.394 --> 03:04:53.087]  And it's my opinion that with this recession, which is actually a depression that we're going into right now, is that a majority of the people in this country are going from derision, and they've been going through anger, and now they're going into fear and depression.
[03:04:53.087 --> 03:04:53.627]  Stay there!
[03:04:53.627 --> 03:04:54.168]  Gotta break!
[03:04:54.168 --> 03:05:00.452]  George Humphrey, our guest in studio, will continue with this analysis on the other side as the resistance mounts.
[03:05:01.604 --> 03:05:09.871]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[03:05:09.871 --> 03:05:14.435]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[03:05:14.435 --> 03:05:19.099]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[03:05:19.099 --> 03:05:20.500]  It's a documented fact.
[03:05:21.380 --> 03:05:28.143]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[03:05:28.143 --> 03:05:40.247]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[03:05:40.247 --> 03:05:43.908]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[03:05:44.508 --> 03:05:47.649]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[03:05:47.649 --> 03:05:51.310]  FPP is so affordable, you can't afford to do without.
[03:05:51.310 --> 03:05:58.172]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[03:05:58.172 --> 03:06:00.132]  That's 888-949-3570.
[03:06:00.132 --> 03:06:08.474]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:08.474 --> 03:06:10.155]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:11.129 --> 03:06:12.670]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.670 --> 03:06:13.470]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.470 --> 03:06:14.450]  This is his M.O.
[03:06:14.450 --> 03:06:15.831]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.831 --> 03:06:17.831]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.831 --> 03:06:24.974]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:24.974 --> 03:06:25.454]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.454 --> 03:06:31.096]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.796 --> 03:06:35.338]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.338 --> 03:06:38.099]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:01.590 --> 03:07:07.435]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:07:07.435 --> 03:07:12.860]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:18.245]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:07:18.245 --> 03:07:21.808]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[03:07:22.088 --> 03:07:24.131]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[03:07:24.131 --> 03:07:27.075]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[03:07:27.075 --> 03:07:30.359]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:07:30.359 --> 03:07:34.165]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:07:34.165 --> 03:07:38.671]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:07:38.951 --> 03:07:40.011]  Do your part.
[03:07:40.011 --> 03:07:42.632]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[03:07:42.632 --> 03:07:51.835]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[03:07:51.835 --> 03:07:58.297]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[03:07:58.297 --> 03:07:59.698]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:19.331]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.331 --> 03:08:23.914]  George Humphreys our guest in studio, filmmaker, author, resistor of the New World Order,
[03:08:25.356 --> 03:08:30.439]  He came up in that early 1990s wave that so many of us activated in.
[03:08:30.439 --> 03:08:32.201]  We felt it in our spirit.
[03:08:32.201 --> 03:08:33.622]  All the evidence was there.
[03:08:33.622 --> 03:08:38.325]  Now a wave, I would say a thousand times bigger, a wavelength has begun.
[03:08:38.325 --> 03:08:39.906]  The enemy sees it.
[03:08:39.906 --> 03:08:43.268]  We've analyzed their attack profile, George, and it's all about stopping the states.
[03:08:43.268 --> 03:08:47.191]  And more and more I realize that is the key point and they are scared.
[03:08:47.811 --> 03:08:59.381]  And I think if the people just energize and realize they have victory, and the phony Christian churches have taught them this is the end, you've got to lay down to corruption, you can't stop it.
[03:08:59.381 --> 03:09:01.262]  That's the opposite of what Christ taught.
[03:09:01.262 --> 03:09:02.163]  Absolutely.
[03:09:02.163 --> 03:09:05.086]  And regardless of the consequences, we're always to do right.
[03:09:06.006 --> 03:09:10.409]  And the clergy response teams, the brainwashed FEMA patrols, now it's all public.
[03:09:10.409 --> 03:09:12.270]  Everything we said came true.
[03:09:12.270 --> 03:09:16.013]  Now people that laughed at us are remembering and they're understanding.
[03:09:16.013 --> 03:09:18.194]  So now is the time of maximum effort.
[03:09:18.194 --> 03:09:19.355]  Please continue.
[03:09:19.355 --> 03:09:20.796]  Well, absolutely.
[03:09:20.796 --> 03:09:26.220]  And I think we should go back to our philosophy about what life is and what you just said.
[03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:34.022]  The one that most people call Jesus, who I call Yeshua, he taught individual freedom.
[03:09:34.022 --> 03:09:47.806]  He taught about spirituality, about divinity, that each and every one of us are powerful, we're divine, we're sovereign, and that one person can make a difference.
[03:09:48.914 --> 03:10:09.030]  Seventy-five years ago we saw Mahatma Gandhi do the same thing in India, and that's what you and I and others are doing, is that not only are we sharing the information of the First Awakening, but we're also sharing the information that every single one of us is a part of the healing or the destruction of this culture.
[03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:12.513]  And I choose, and I think you choose, to be a part of the healing.
[03:10:12.513 --> 03:10:14.975]  And the first thing is to get the right information.
[03:10:15.515 --> 03:10:29.384]  And quite clearly, quite clearly, the culture of America has been, and of the Western cultures, has been manipulated very, very cleverly to make people, put people in victim consciousness.
[03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:32.221]  And to make us addicted.
[03:10:32.221 --> 03:10:39.287]  And we quite clearly have become addicted to mammon, or materialism, or to the soft life.
[03:10:39.287 --> 03:10:45.051]  And in Alcoholics Anonymous, they always say the first step is acknowledgement.
[03:10:45.051 --> 03:10:48.514]  And then they talk about the different steps of breaking through.
[03:10:48.514 --> 03:10:58.641]  And in most, it's denial, it's depression, I mean derision, and then it's anger, and then fear,
[03:10:59.815 --> 03:11:02.116]  And then, depression.
[03:11:02.116 --> 03:11:04.318]  And then, finally, acceptance.
[03:11:04.318 --> 03:11:11.062]  And for years and years, the information that Alex and I put out, it was denied, denied, denied.
[03:11:11.062 --> 03:11:12.642]  And then there was a lot of derision.
[03:11:12.642 --> 03:11:13.703]  Oh, there goes Alex.
[03:11:13.703 --> 03:11:15.044]  Oh, there goes George.
[03:11:15.044 --> 03:11:18.046]  Those crazy guys talking about conspiracy theory.
[03:11:18.946 --> 03:11:30.733]  And now, with what's going on, people have gone through kind of the angry phase, but now they're going into the deep fear and depression stages because they're losing their money.
[03:11:30.733 --> 03:11:41.319]  And as an economist, I always like to look at the economy because it is always the precursor to the political, cultural, and environmental changes.
[03:11:41.319 --> 03:11:42.420]  And George, you wrote a book
[03:11:43.180 --> 03:11:58.804]  Was it 10 or 11 years ago where you said, with the derivatives, they were getting us all in debt, getting us leveraged, they were buying up the world, while the fiat Ponzi scheme had value, and then they leave us holding the bag, and then they come in with the only currency as the saviors, and totally take over society?
[03:11:58.804 --> 03:11:59.565]  You're right!
[03:11:59.565 --> 03:12:01.165]  Well, yeah.
[03:12:01.165 --> 03:12:10.528]  I mean, it's not me being right, it's just the information is there, and I've written three different booklets, and you've written several different booklets, and 12 years ago,
[03:12:12.028 --> 03:12:15.772]  Twelve years ago, we were laying this whole scenario out.
[03:12:15.772 --> 03:12:20.076]  I thought that the bubble was going to burst three or four years ago.
[03:12:20.076 --> 03:12:27.363]  But very skillfully, the masters of deception have been able to keep pumping, pumping, pumping up the bubble.
[03:12:27.363 --> 03:12:29.925]  But all bubbles eventually break.
[03:12:29.925 --> 03:12:34.430]  And this economic bubble, through the structured investment vehicles, the derivatives,
[03:12:36.007 --> 03:12:45.794]  It's the biggest bubble ever in the whole world, bigger than the real estate bubble, bigger than any of the other bubbles that we have seen.
[03:12:45.794 --> 03:13:04.067]  And because these derivatives were unregulated, unregulated, our slave masters were able to take profits at 20, 30, 50, and sometimes 100 to 1 as they pushed up these derived indexes.
[03:13:04.767 --> 03:13:11.709]  And that's what caused this huge... I mean it's so far past bankruptcy that...
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:15.881]  Words don't even describe where we are.
[03:13:15.881 --> 03:13:20.822]  We were talking about bankruptcy, you know, 15 years ago.
[03:13:20.822 --> 03:13:28.984]  But with, as most of you are aware of, with a fiat currency, it's designed to fail.
[03:13:28.984 --> 03:13:35.946]  With a fiat currency, which is what we have, it is mathematically impossible to pay off the debt.
[03:13:37.319 --> 03:13:53.414]  And with this new bailout or stimulus package that is being created for us by Brother Obama, it is just the height of insanity to think that we're going to be able to come out of this doldrums of this depression by creating more debt.
[03:13:54.554 --> 03:14:00.196]  You can't come out of something by creating more debt, which is exactly what we're doing.
[03:14:00.196 --> 03:14:16.580]  And the figures that I have right now, not from some new age guy or from some hardcore, you know, wild person, but from CNBC, is that the stimulus package, this bailout, is not 700 or 800 billion dollars.
[03:14:16.580 --> 03:14:18.541]  It's 7.3 trillion dollars.
[03:14:25.011 --> 03:14:32.775]  That's with the T. Now remember, our gross national product this year is going to be about ten and a half, ten trillion dollars.
[03:14:32.775 --> 03:14:48.563]  And so what we're putting out is something that in adjusted terms, in adjusted inflation, is two and a half times greater than all of the money spent on World War II.
[03:14:48.563 --> 03:14:51.685]  Now, that gum, that's a whole lot of money.
[03:14:52.904 --> 03:14:56.229]  And we're just now getting into this.
[03:14:56.229 --> 03:15:05.722]  And the really, truly wild part about all of this is, is that over three and a half trillion dollars of the seven trillion dollars
[03:15:07.259 --> 03:15:33.880]  is from the Federal Reserve Board that is being issued to financial institutions without, again, without the jurisdiction or the vote of Congress, without accounting, there is no transparency, Bernanke has refused to give the information, and this by itself, you know, this last week they're talking about an eight hundred billion dollar stimulus program.
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:36.821]  And that's a heck of a lot of money.
[03:15:36.821 --> 03:15:42.464]  That is like twice as much in real terms as Louisiana Purchase.
[03:15:42.464 --> 03:15:55.050]  But what we're talking about is four times that amount that is being put into the hands of the financial institutions, the very, very folks who created the situation, without
[03:15:56.090 --> 03:16:01.732]  George, Monday, I don't want to get your take on this because it segues into what you were just discussing or dovetails.
[03:16:16.693 --> 03:16:21.078]  Bloomberg Financial that I have a lot of respect for compared to any other publication.
[03:16:21.078 --> 03:16:26.203]  It's New World Order, but it's for real people in the system, so they tell the truth most of the time.
[03:16:26.203 --> 03:16:28.606]  But it said the headline was $9.7 trillion so far in banker bailout.
[03:16:32.910 --> 03:16:40.912]  And then it showed the numbers that that was over 90% of all mortgages at 2008 levels, when they were worth more.
[03:16:40.912 --> 03:16:56.517]  So, they made us think this was all about bailing out mortgages, but when they passed the banker bailout bill on October 3rd, 2008, the next day on Saturday, Paulson said, oh, we're not even going to use it for that now, because that's not what it's for.
[03:16:56.517 --> 03:16:59.958]  So they've already generated enough money to them, and they say it's secret where it went,
[03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:05.893]  To pay off 90 plus percent of the mortgages in the nation.
[03:17:05.893 --> 03:17:08.114]  So it's a complete fraud.
[03:17:08.114 --> 03:17:13.198]  So comment on that and then they won't say where the money's going, where do you think it's going?
[03:17:13.198 --> 03:17:16.440]  I mean they have some leaks that they're buying up infrastructure, massing the cash.
[03:17:17.020 --> 03:17:20.083]  Well, the very first monies went to J.P.
[03:17:20.083 --> 03:17:23.525]  Morgan, and I cannot prove this, but J.P.
[03:17:23.525 --> 03:17:27.829]  Morgan is very connected with the metals trade, and especially with silver.
[03:17:27.829 --> 03:17:32.973]  And about four and a half months ago, silver was selling for $18.70, and within about two weeks it went down to $11, and then down to $8.70.
[03:17:37.358 --> 03:17:48.465]  Now, at the very, very same period of time, over 60% of the silver that is traded in this country is over-the-counter in the small gun shops and the trading areas.
[03:17:48.465 --> 03:17:51.146]  And suddenly, all of the silver disappeared.
[03:17:51.146 --> 03:17:55.569]  And it's still very, very difficult to buy or find silver bullion.
[03:17:56.263 --> 03:18:07.827]  Now, in a free market society, if the silver disappears, or if it goes away, or if it's difficult, the price of the product or the commodity should go up and up and up.
[03:18:07.827 --> 03:18:11.549]  And yet, the price went down by over 55%.
[03:18:11.549 --> 03:18:14.730]  Now, quite clearly, that is manipulation.
[03:18:14.730 --> 03:18:17.631]  And because silver is a relatively small market,
[03:18:18.231 --> 03:18:20.493]  It is easy to manipulate.
[03:18:20.493 --> 03:18:36.186]  And you know, and all the figures that we're talking about don't even include the hundreds of billions, if not several, you know, one to two trillion dollars that has been put into the Plunge Protection Team in the last year and a half.
[03:18:36.186 --> 03:18:39.248]  And yesterday, the market was down about 300 points.
[03:18:39.248 --> 03:18:42.151]  In the last half hour, the market went up 200 points.
[03:18:42.151 --> 03:18:44.332]  And quite clearly, it went straight up.
[03:18:44.332 --> 03:18:45.934]  Markets don't go straight up.
[03:18:46.474 --> 03:18:51.897]  And that it was clearly the auspices of the Plunge Protection Team.
[03:18:51.897 --> 03:18:55.900]  Now the problem, and again, we're supposed to have a free country.
[03:18:56.889 --> 03:18:59.070]  We're supposed to have a free country.
[03:18:59.070 --> 03:19:05.432]  And the accounting of the monies is the foundation or the basis of what's going on.
[03:19:05.432 --> 03:19:17.497]  And if you can't account for the money, and whether the number is 7 trillion, or whether it's 9 trillion, or whether it's 12 or 15 trillion, we don't know.
[03:19:18.297 --> 03:19:32.030]  But just, when I was a city council member, I always thought it was kind of interesting because when we'd have a project that would go for a couple hundred thousand dollars or five hundred thousand dollars, there'd be debate for hours and hours about where it would go.
[03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:36.073]  But when the projects would get up to fifteen, twenty million dollars,
[03:19:36.934 --> 03:19:43.216]  That was a number that was too big for a lot of people to understand, and they just go, you know, what do you think?
[03:19:43.216 --> 03:19:45.397]  Just pass it, you know, go ahead.
[03:19:45.397 --> 03:19:54.660]  And now, instead of talking about hundreds of thousands or millions or even billions now, is that what we're talking about is trillions.
[03:19:54.660 --> 03:19:55.200]  Gotta break!
[03:19:55.200 --> 03:19:55.640]  Gotta break!
[03:19:55.640 --> 03:19:57.100]  I'm back with George Humphrey.
[03:19:57.100 --> 03:19:58.021]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:19:58.021 --> 03:20:03.402]  This is Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:20:03.402 --> 03:20:05.343]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:09.058]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[03:20:09.058 --> 03:20:13.230]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[03:20:13.996 --> 03:20:16.098]  You know that you need to prepare.
[03:20:16.098 --> 03:20:19.501]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.

[03:21:03.157 --> 03:21:06.019]  Please, I've come with a message of information.
[03:21:06.019 --> 03:21:08.640]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:21:08.640 --> 03:21:09.841]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:09.841 --> 03:21:11.562]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.562 --> 03:21:14.444]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:14.444 --> 03:21:18.686]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:18.686 --> 03:21:27.732]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[03:21:27.732 --> 03:21:32.595]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:36.394 --> 03:21:38.835]  How dare you?
[03:21:38.835 --> 03:21:44.056]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:44.056 --> 03:21:46.797]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.797 --> 03:21:53.019]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:21:53.019 --> 03:21:56.120]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:21:56.120 --> 03:21:58.360]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:21:58.360 --> 03:22:00.841]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:22:02.515 --> 03:22:03.836]  10 Enters of Might is February 13, 2008.
[03:22:03.836 --> 03:22:04.156]  Gold 93660.
[03:22:04.156 --> 03:22:07.839]  Old school coins can be purchased for 963.49, 481.75 for half, 240.75 for quarter.
[03:22:07.839 --> 03:22:08.300]  That's 963.49, 481.75, and 240.75.
[03:22:20.060 --> 03:22:21.381]  We all want liberty.
[03:22:21.381 --> 03:22:22.722]  Some give their lives for it.
[03:22:22.722 --> 03:22:24.724]  A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[03:22:24.724 --> 03:22:26.986]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom.
[03:22:26.986 --> 03:22:27.726]  For what?
[03:22:27.726 --> 03:22:39.095]  February 28th, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown, Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler to cover monetary policy.
[03:22:39.275 --> 03:22:39.555]  We're good.
[03:23:01.463 --> 03:23:04.906]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:23:04.906 --> 03:23:09.170]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:23:09.170 --> 03:23:17.138]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[03:23:17.418 --> 03:23:17.838]  We're good to go!
[03:23:50.305 --> 03:23:54.268]  There might still be time to turn this around, but it's up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:21.081 --> 03:24:28.026]  What are you going to do?
[03:24:28.026 --> 03:24:35.671]  But I know this, letting the same bankers that have robbed the daylights out of us and are engineering this society into hell aren't going to fix anything.
[03:24:35.671 --> 03:24:38.133]  Because they're doing what they want to do.
[03:24:38.133 --> 03:24:39.794]  To them, it is working just fine.
[03:24:42.657 --> 03:24:44.719]  George Humphrey, my guest in studio.
[03:24:44.719 --> 03:24:48.522]  George, let's continue with the economic line you were going down with.
[03:24:48.522 --> 03:24:55.608]  We're now from the millions to the billions to the trillions to the quadrillions.
[03:24:55.608 --> 03:25:07.678]  Actually, that word, quadrillions, first came up about eight or nine months ago when we were talking about the number of derivatives that are out in the system.
[03:25:08.479 --> 03:25:10.940]  A quadrillion!
[03:25:10.940 --> 03:25:15.201]  I mean, these are numbers that people can't even understand.
[03:25:15.201 --> 03:25:35.408]  A trillion dollars, just to put it in perspective, the day that Jesus, or Yeshua, was born, if you had a big kitty and put a thousand dollars in the kitty every single day, for every day of his life, through the time of the disciples, through the time of Rome, through the Dark Ages, into the Renaissance,
[03:25:36.681 --> 03:25:39.583]  Into the discovery of the West.
[03:25:39.583 --> 03:25:41.484]  Into the colonization.
[03:25:41.484 --> 03:25:42.244]  Into right now.
[03:25:42.244 --> 03:25:44.445]  $1,000 a day for the last 2,000 years.
[03:25:49.144 --> 03:25:55.147]  The total amount would be six hundred and seventy billion dollars.
[03:25:55.147 --> 03:25:56.968]  Not even a trillion dollars.
[03:25:56.968 --> 03:25:58.789]  That's how much money we're talking about.
[03:25:58.789 --> 03:26:01.671]  And a quadrillion is a thousand trillion.
[03:26:01.671 --> 03:26:03.272]  A thousand trillion.
[03:26:03.272 --> 03:26:08.095]  And they're not talking about, I mean, we would have financial guest on a year or two ago saying it's up to
[03:26:08.735 --> 03:26:10.236]  One and a half quadrillion.
[03:26:10.236 --> 03:26:15.281]  And then now we're seeing in mainstream news that the total derivatives may be two quadrillion.
[03:26:15.281 --> 03:26:16.822]  They're now using that term.
[03:26:16.822 --> 03:26:17.563]  And we don't know.
[03:26:17.563 --> 03:26:23.207]  I mean, the point is, is that anybody who says they do know, you know, is blowing smoke.
[03:26:23.207 --> 03:26:24.188]  Because we don't know.
[03:26:24.188 --> 03:26:25.509]  Because that information.
[03:26:25.509 --> 03:26:27.611]  But whether it is fifty...
[03:26:28.712 --> 03:26:36.394]  You know, 50 trillion or 100 trillion or 500 trillion or a quadrillion, it doesn't make any difference.
[03:26:36.394 --> 03:26:39.435]  You know, the bomb has already killed the patient.
[03:26:39.435 --> 03:26:41.235]  It's all gone.
[03:26:41.235 --> 03:26:43.816]  The system is broke.
[03:26:43.816 --> 03:26:53.139]  And until we go back to constitutional money, until we eliminate the Federal Reserve Board, until we have a hard currency,
[03:26:53.999 --> 03:26:56.964]  The situation is going to get worse and worse and worse.
[03:26:56.964 --> 03:27:07.702]  And oh, about eight or nine years ago, when the Asian countries went down, is the United States went in there and they said, you've got to get rid of all of your toxic debts.
[03:27:08.823 --> 03:27:13.805]  And they kicked and screamed and they kicked and screamed but they finally got rid of their toxic debts.
[03:27:13.805 --> 03:27:26.849]  They had two or three years and now the countries like Thailand and Vietnam and Indonesia are coming back up and they're coming stronger because they got rid of their toxic debts.
[03:27:26.849 --> 03:27:34.212]  Now 20 years ago when Japan went down, they didn't get rid of their toxic debts and they've had 20 years of recession.
[03:27:34.992 --> 03:27:45.983]  Right now, we're just feeding all this money, good money after bad, into these financial situations, and there is no way to stop the bleeding.
[03:27:45.983 --> 03:27:47.945]  There is no way to stop the bleeding.
[03:27:47.945 --> 03:27:55.412]  And unless we cut out the toxic debts, unless we take our medicine, unless we go back to constitutional money,
[03:27:56.707 --> 03:27:59.169]  It's just not going to happen.
[03:27:59.169 --> 03:28:06.995]  Unless we invest in productivity, unless we invest in sustainability, unless we invest in our people.
[03:28:08.157 --> 03:28:09.437]  It's not going to happen.
[03:28:09.437 --> 03:28:13.299]  And these are the choices that Alex is putting out to all of us.
[03:28:13.299 --> 03:28:21.161]  And now we have to become aware of it through this information war, and then share this information with our friends and families, and change the paradigm.
[03:28:21.161 --> 03:28:28.764]  Now George, when you look at what the globalists have done, they want us dependent, they want us domesticated, they want us institutionalized, and they say in their own documents.
[03:28:28.764 --> 03:28:33.525]  That's why they paid for decades for companies to leave the United States tax incentives.
[03:28:33.525 --> 03:28:35.126]  That's why they did everything they could
[03:28:35.766 --> 03:28:44.831]  And now you look at their stimulus, it's only to expand their power control and accelerate the debt while telling us on the news it's our fault we did it.
[03:28:44.831 --> 03:28:48.253]  And it is our fault in that we let the globalists carry this out.
[03:28:48.253 --> 03:28:54.417]  But that's like a kid who's five years old and didn't listen to mom and gets tricked into the back of a van and gets raped and tortured to death.
[03:28:54.417 --> 03:28:57.799]  Still, you don't blame the five-year-old, you blame the guy that kidnapped the child.
[03:28:57.799 --> 03:28:59.840]  And the kidnapper is the bankers.
[03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:01.241]  Oh, there's no question about it.
[03:29:01.241 --> 03:29:03.262]  And it's just not the bankers in New York.
[03:29:03.262 --> 03:29:05.063]  This has been an international cabal.
[03:29:05.683 --> 03:29:10.484]  instituted by Adam Weishauf and the Rothschilds back in 1776.
[03:29:10.484 --> 03:29:12.844]  And again, this is not conspiracy theory.
[03:29:12.844 --> 03:29:14.785]  This is just plain fact.
[03:29:14.785 --> 03:29:22.266]  They instituted, you know, the brains of Rothschild is to institute fiat currency.
[03:29:22.266 --> 03:29:24.366]  And he took over the Banque Nationale de Paris.
[03:29:24.366 --> 03:29:26.327]  He took over the Bank of England.
[03:29:26.327 --> 03:29:28.267]  He took over the Bank of Italy.
[03:29:28.267 --> 03:29:29.527]  They've taken over the city.
[03:29:29.527 --> 03:29:30.967]  They've taken over Chase.
[03:29:30.967 --> 03:29:33.348]  And they've taken over the full
[03:29:34.148 --> 03:29:36.749]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:36.749 --> 03:29:38.370]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.903 --> 03:30:06.947]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[03:30:06.947 --> 03:30:15.575]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[03:30:15.575 --> 03:30:20.499]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[03:30:20.499 --> 03:30:27.565]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[03:30:27.565 --> 03:30:30.127]  This water system will descale all piping, hot
[03:30:30.387 --> 03:30:30.967]  We're good to go!
[03:30:53.621 --> 03:30:57.225]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:30:57.225 --> 03:31:00.068]  That's 908-691-2608.
[03:31:00.068 --> 03:31:08.476]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:08.476 --> 03:31:10.138]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:11.112 --> 03:31:12.653]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:12.653 --> 03:31:13.454]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:13.454 --> 03:31:14.435]  This is his ammo.
[03:31:14.435 --> 03:31:15.816]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:15.816 --> 03:31:17.818]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:17.818 --> 03:31:24.964]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:24.964 --> 03:31:25.445]  Some U.S.
[03:31:25.445 --> 03:31:31.090]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:35.271]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:35.271 --> 03:31:37.452]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:03.726 --> 03:32:08.250]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[03:32:08.250 --> 03:32:11.613]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[03:32:11.613 --> 03:32:16.477]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[03:32:16.477 --> 03:32:21.101]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[03:32:21.641 --> 03:32:33.477]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[03:32:33.477 --> 03:32:36.321]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[03:32:36.781 --> 03:32:40.023]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:32:40.023 --> 03:32:43.345]  That's 1-800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[03:32:43.345 --> 03:32:46.467]  Or go to my website at TaxHelpOnline.com.
[03:32:46.467 --> 03:32:51.750]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades and he can help you.
[03:32:51.750 --> 03:32:52.730]  Call us today 1-800-346-6829.
[03:32:52.730 --> 03:32:53.131]  That's 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:31.244]  Yeah!
[03:33:31.244 --> 03:33:32.465]  We are back live.
[03:33:32.465 --> 03:33:34.207]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:33:34.207 --> 03:33:38.230]  Now think of our few of our sponsors and then go right back to George Humphrey.
[03:33:38.230 --> 03:33:44.536]  Right here in studio with us today.
[03:33:44.536 --> 03:33:52.063]  Okay, I want to again just tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this transmission possible.
[03:33:52.063 --> 03:33:52.464]  One of them
[03:33:54.253 --> 03:33:55.913]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:33:55.913 --> 03:33:58.294]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[03:33:58.294 --> 03:34:00.575]  Hurricanes, snow, ice, storms.
[03:34:00.575 --> 03:34:04.056]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid and here's a good way to do just that.
[03:34:04.056 --> 03:34:09.077]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor Solutions from Science.
[03:34:09.077 --> 03:34:13.558]  It's designed to provide 1800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[03:34:13.558 --> 03:34:21.220]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity
[03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:29.123]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[03:34:29.123 --> 03:34:32.624]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[03:34:32.624 --> 03:34:35.165]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:34:35.165 --> 03:34:39.066]  Check them out at MySolarBackup.com or the banner up on Infowars.com.
[03:34:39.066 --> 03:34:40.747]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[03:34:49.931 --> 03:34:51.925]  Another one of our fine sponsors.
[03:34:54.281 --> 03:34:58.885]  And I want folks to check out is survivalistseeds.com.
[03:34:58.885 --> 03:35:03.570]  Grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free from the New World Order.
[03:35:03.570 --> 03:35:09.996]  This family business buys in massive bucks and passes those huge discounts on to our listeners.
[03:35:09.996 --> 03:35:15.240]  15,000 heirloom seeds will provide you and your family with healthy food for seven years.
[03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:17.402]  Stop buying and eating New World Order food.
[03:35:17.402 --> 03:35:19.524]  Grow for your own family in your backyard.
[03:35:20.225 --> 03:35:22.027]  Fifteen thousand heirloom seeds.
[03:35:22.027 --> 03:35:25.430]  That's real food insurance for the difficult times that we're already entering.
[03:35:25.430 --> 03:35:30.175]  Heirloom seeds are from the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[03:35:30.175 --> 03:35:32.777]  All their seeds date back over a century.
[03:35:32.777 --> 03:35:35.840]  Their Mayflower bean came over on the Mayflower ship.
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:40.224]  Now survivalofseeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers and sell them back
[03:35:40.945 --> 03:35:46.729]  The seeds you've saved year after year because demand is skyrocketing for the rare heirloom seeds.
[03:35:46.729 --> 03:35:52.213]  You also get a DVD teaching you how to sell your vegetable produce to restaurants, delis, and farmers markets.
[03:35:52.213 --> 03:35:54.935]  Slaves hesitate, patriots take action.
[03:35:54.935 --> 03:35:57.537]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[03:35:57.537 --> 03:36:03.322]  And again, it's the sponsors that allow us to continue to operate and I believe in all the sponsors I endorse here.
[03:36:03.322 --> 03:36:04.863]  So, survivalistseeds.com.
[03:36:04.863 --> 03:36:05.423]  Okay, George.
[03:36:06.924 --> 03:36:16.696]  First of all, I'd like to say thank you to your sponsors, because those companies... I have solar on my house, it provides about 30% of my power, and everybody has to be aware.
[03:36:16.696 --> 03:36:20.982]  You've got to start planting your victory gardens right now.
[03:36:20.982 --> 03:36:24.246]  Food is going to be the massive roadblock.
[03:36:24.346 --> 03:36:28.227]  And while you're out there planting it and enjoying it, you're meant to dig in the dirt and see earthworms.
[03:36:28.227 --> 03:36:28.707]  Absolutely.
[03:36:28.707 --> 03:36:29.988]  Your children just love it.
[03:36:29.988 --> 03:36:31.108]  They don't want to watch TV.
[03:36:31.108 --> 03:36:32.249]  Give them a chance.
[03:36:32.249 --> 03:36:37.670]  And then while you're planting and doing this, you'll get spiritually centered and think about how you're fighting the new world order.
[03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:40.671]  And it's the journey of a thousand miles starts with that single step.
[03:36:40.671 --> 03:36:45.853]  In a very small space, if you do it right, you can grow a tremendous amount of food.
[03:36:45.853 --> 03:36:47.554]  So, just think about it.
[03:36:48.294 --> 03:36:49.755]  Get some solar.
[03:36:49.755 --> 03:36:53.057]  Get a car that gets at least 30 miles a gallon.
[03:36:53.057 --> 03:36:54.377]  Get a victory garden.
[03:36:54.377 --> 03:36:56.718]  Start becoming sustainable right now.
[03:36:56.718 --> 03:36:58.920]  And that's real sustainable, not their counterfeit sustainable.
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:36:59.620]  Right.
[03:36:59.620 --> 03:37:00.460]  Which they mean controlled.
[03:37:00.460 --> 03:37:02.482]  Now George, let's get into
[03:37:03.662 --> 03:37:05.003]  Obama.
[03:37:05.003 --> 03:37:18.932]  I mean, if you were standing before a group of well-meaning Obama people that knew Bush was bad and evil, the torture, the secret arrest, the wars, and then the media craftily, the same media that put him in power,
[03:37:19.732 --> 03:37:27.498]  Transmuted all the hatred of Bush onto love of Obama, and then now he's completely already, just a month in office, betrayed all that.
[03:37:27.498 --> 03:37:38.186]  Lay out as if, you know, you're speaking to a lot of them, but directly to them, they're watching this online, they're listening to this on the radio, they're seeing this a month from now, when he's done even more horrible things, versus the rhetoric.
[03:37:38.186 --> 03:37:40.688]  They have the phony right-wing attacking to make the left offending.
[03:37:40.688 --> 03:37:41.969]  You know, they have all these tricks.
[03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:49.521]  But break down as an economist, as a former city council member, as an author, a researcher, what you see happening with Obama.
[03:37:49.912 --> 03:37:57.657]  Well, this is not a theoretical discussion because I had this discussion just a couple days ago with some very, very dear friends of mine.
[03:37:57.657 --> 03:38:02.041]  Very well educated, they love this country, they're learning about things.
[03:38:02.041 --> 03:38:07.785]  They were very, you know, and they come from very highly educated families and they've done a lot of things.
[03:38:07.785 --> 03:38:11.868]  And they were so opposed to what Bush was doing
[03:38:12.765 --> 03:38:15.327]  That they, and then they see Obama.
[03:38:15.327 --> 03:38:25.316]  Quite clearly, Brother Obama is one of the most articulate, intelligent, and charismatic figures ever to come in front of the American people.
[03:38:25.316 --> 03:38:32.742]  And I applaud the leaders, the Illuminati, or the power leader, whatever you want to call these rascals, for creating this character.
[03:38:32.742 --> 03:38:34.763]  I mean, you know, he is the perfect
[03:38:36.105 --> 03:38:41.168]  Uh, opposition to Bush, who was, you know, clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed.
[03:38:41.168 --> 03:38:44.030]  And this Obama, man, I want to like him.
[03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:45.831]  I want to like him.
[03:38:45.831 --> 03:38:47.393]  But you know what?
[03:38:47.393 --> 03:38:51.656]  A tree is judged by its fruit.
[03:38:51.656 --> 03:38:54.157]  A tree is judged by its fruit.
[03:38:54.157 --> 03:38:56.139]  And brother, in telling the truth
[03:38:57.369 --> 03:38:59.350]  To me is step number one.
[03:38:59.350 --> 03:39:09.433]  And Obama, when he first came out, he got a lot of support from the left wing because he was supposedly opposed to the wars in the Middle East.
[03:39:09.433 --> 03:39:11.194]  He voted against the war in Iraq.
[03:39:11.194 --> 03:39:14.655]  He's talked about Afghanistan.
[03:39:14.655 --> 03:39:16.716]  He said, we're going to get out of the Middle East.
[03:39:16.716 --> 03:39:18.137]  We're going to be out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:39:23.035 --> 03:39:28.619]  He talked to us about change and transparency, something that we all want.
[03:39:28.619 --> 03:39:33.603]  He said that he would work for the environment.
[03:39:33.603 --> 03:39:38.286]  He said that he would work to clean up this financial disaster.
[03:39:38.286 --> 03:39:44.231]  He would work to help us get better education and health care for the people of this country.
[03:39:45.461 --> 03:39:56.320]  Now, the son of a gun went, you know, and again, knowing everything that I knew, and I knew where his money was coming from, but I listened and I listened and I listened.
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:39:57.623]  But within one month,
[03:39:59.175 --> 03:40:03.937]  He is absolutely, completely betrayed.
[03:40:03.937 --> 03:40:06.478]  100% betrayed the American people.
[03:40:06.478 --> 03:40:19.905]  And quite, quite clearly, Brother Obama is the most fancy, the most decorated, the most expensive Trojan horse in the history of Western culture.
[03:40:21.203 --> 03:40:22.884]  This guy's amazing.
[03:40:22.884 --> 03:40:31.611]  So let's just take a look at his appointments because you can always tell a person by the company he surrounds himself with.
[03:40:31.611 --> 03:40:34.172]  He said he was going to get us out of the war in Iraq.
[03:40:36.394 --> 03:40:45.416]  He reappointed Bill Gates, one of the architects of the war, a guy who's a member of the CFR and a Bilderberger, and the guy who is a hardline hawk.
[03:40:45.416 --> 03:40:54.019]  He's already broken his promise about getting troops out of Iraq, and he is for, he is for more war.
[03:40:55.451 --> 03:40:57.992]  And sending more troops to Afghanistan.
[03:40:57.992 --> 03:41:07.176]  He is fore-putting nuclear weapons in Poland and the Ukraine and Georgia aimed at Russia.
[03:41:07.176 --> 03:41:11.538]  Now this is a part of the puzzle that's never talked about.
[03:41:11.538 --> 03:41:13.359]  And I'm not pro-Russian, you know.
[03:41:13.979 --> 03:41:26.893]  But I can understand why the Russians have a burr under their saddle, because if the Russians were pointing nuclear weapons at us, we would be very upset.
[03:41:26.893 --> 03:41:33.580]  And Obama is supporting putting short-term, intermediate-range,
[03:41:34.501 --> 03:41:41.282]  Nuclear missiles pointed at Moscow in the Ukraine, in Poland, and in Georgia.
[03:41:41.282 --> 03:41:46.803]  This is an act of war, my friends, and this man is not a man of peace.
[03:41:46.803 --> 03:41:52.884]  His director, his Justice Department man, Eric Holder.
[03:41:52.884 --> 03:42:02.066]  Now, the Second Amendment was put number two very, very clearly by our Founding Fathers because they wanted us to be free.
[03:42:03.186 --> 03:42:10.373]  And the Second Amendment is about us, we, the citizens of this country defending themselves.
[03:42:10.373 --> 03:42:20.484]  Eric Holder is on record saying that the Second Amendment was only intended for the military.
[03:42:20.484 --> 03:42:26.270]  Obama clearly is first going to go after the ammunition, and then he's going to go after the weapons.
[03:42:27.702 --> 03:42:30.805]  And these weapons are what keeps us free.
[03:42:30.805 --> 03:42:39.813]  I am, you know, my mentor, my biggest, the person I read more about than anybody else is Mahatma Gandhi.
[03:42:39.813 --> 03:42:50.343]  I go to India every year, I believe in Satra Gaha, and even Gandhi said, it is better to join the army and die fighting for your country than to be a coward.
[03:42:51.863 --> 03:42:56.305]  And I don't think that we, clearly we don't want to go into violence right now.
[03:42:56.305 --> 03:42:58.666]  That would play in the hands of the power elite.
[03:42:58.666 --> 03:43:00.206]  But we can't lie down to this.
[03:43:00.206 --> 03:43:02.667]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[03:43:02.667 --> 03:43:07.189]  It's the willingness to fight back that keeps the enemy from going for the full move.
[03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:12.511]  Because they know there's a large contingent of people, I would say at least 10 million, who are ready to go.
[03:43:12.751 --> 03:43:22.477]  And what's really beautiful is that in the gun stores all across the country, gun sales are up between 75 to 150 percent in the last three months.
[03:43:22.477 --> 03:43:33.624]  People of this country, good people of this country, people who are not violent, people who believe in the Republic, people who believe in the rule of law, realize that they need to arm themselves.
[03:43:34.204 --> 03:43:38.386]  And so, you know, again, none of us are advocating violence.
[03:43:38.386 --> 03:43:48.130]  What we are advocating is the protection of our Bill of Rights, the protection of our Republic, the protection of the rule of law, and the protection of our families and our culture.
[03:43:48.130 --> 03:43:56.273]  Well, George, they're building FEMA camps, they're militarizing the police, they are building an army against us, and we have to defend ourselves.
[03:43:56.273 --> 03:43:57.293]  Well, absolutely.
[03:43:57.293 --> 03:43:58.734]  And, you know, and, and,
[03:43:59.734 --> 03:44:07.341]  And the reason that we're on radio and television and writing books right now is so it doesn't come to that.
[03:44:07.341 --> 03:44:18.092]  And if you, if your friends, if your family, if your acquaintances, if the people in the grocery stores become aware of this and stand up and say no, it doesn't have to come to this.
[03:44:18.092 --> 03:44:19.633]  The choice is right now.
[03:44:19.633 --> 03:44:23.637]  Either we can stand up and protect this country right now, or it's going to come to this.
[03:44:24.198 --> 03:44:24.558]  I think?
[03:44:39.369 --> 03:44:41.791]  He is a true work of art.
[03:44:41.791 --> 03:44:49.397]  He was the head of the Federal Reserve in New York, which is the most powerful of the branch banks.
[03:44:49.397 --> 03:44:51.098]  He worked at the Treasury.
[03:44:51.098 --> 03:44:56.963]  He is close, close, close with Paulson, who, in my mind, is an economic Nazi.
[03:44:56.963 --> 03:45:06.230]  He worked at the IMF, but he was also not just a member of, but a paid employee of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:45:08.069 --> 03:45:14.781]  You talk about, you know, saying the fox has been hired to guard the hen house is such a lame analogy.
[03:45:14.781 --> 03:45:15.862]  We're talking about
[03:45:18.024 --> 03:45:24.691]  The criminals, criminals, who created this situation, Paulson, Gettner, Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[03:45:24.691 --> 03:45:30.657]  Morgan, Citibank, Chase, the whole group of them, with the epicenter at Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[03:45:30.657 --> 03:45:38.946]  Morgan, who created the structured investment vehicles, who created this toxic waste, who created these derivatives, who made
[03:45:40.047 --> 03:45:51.171]  Millions and billions, in some cases trillions on the way up, looting the American treasuries, looting the value of this country, are now making even more on the way down.
[03:45:54.085 --> 03:45:58.347]  The fact that there is not more outrage about this is just amazing.
[03:45:58.347 --> 03:46:01.469]  Number four, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
[03:46:01.469 --> 03:46:03.950]  Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State.
[03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:13.675]  And I remember 15, 16 years ago I was writing a book called Common Sense and one of the chapters was about the Clintons and I went up to
[03:46:14.936 --> 03:46:20.102]  I've heard a lot of rumors about what the Clintons had done in Mena, Arkansas.
[03:46:20.102 --> 03:46:27.729]  I know that Alex has talked about Mena, Arkansas hundreds of times here, and I just didn't believe that
[03:46:29.068 --> 03:46:33.792]  The shenanigans, not shenanigans, because it's not shenanigans, it's cold-blooded murder.
[03:46:33.792 --> 03:46:34.913]  A lot of it's on record.
[03:46:34.913 --> 03:46:44.019]  Yeah, it's absolutely on record, is that there are 90, and you can look this up on the web, there are 93 people
[03:46:46.181 --> 03:46:59.933]  Back in the 80s and the 90s, who were all in their teens, 20s, 30s, and 40s, who all died violent deaths, and their only common denominator was their connection with Clinton's.
[03:46:59.933 --> 03:47:05.258]  Now the potential for this not to be connected is four and a half billion to one.
[03:47:06.574 --> 03:47:10.497]  And Hillary Clinton, yeah, she's very intelligent, she's hard-working.
[03:47:10.497 --> 03:47:11.678]  Yeah, but how has this changed?
[03:47:11.678 --> 03:47:13.039]  He promised change.
[03:47:13.039 --> 03:47:15.161]  He brought in all the old Bush and Clinton guard.
[03:47:15.161 --> 03:47:18.824]  Yeah, you know, he promised no lobbyists.
[03:47:18.824 --> 03:47:25.389]  He promised change every single one of his appointments.
[03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:27.951]  The only change is a change in the names.
[03:47:27.951 --> 03:47:30.713]  They're all members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:47:30.713 --> 03:47:32.774]  Most of them are members of the Bilderberg.
[03:47:32.774 --> 03:47:34.996]  They are all the status quo from the 1990s.
[03:47:37.237 --> 03:47:56.182]  And folks, if you can't see this, no matter how handsome he is, no matter how sweetly he speaks, no matter how much good rock and roll music there is, and I would have loved to have gone to the inauguration because I love Shakira and I love Bruce Springsteen and I love all that stuff.
[03:47:58.476 --> 03:47:59.897]  But it's just stuff.
[03:47:59.897 --> 03:48:03.039]  Words and actions are what's important.
[03:48:03.039 --> 03:48:10.825]  Then we go down to Homeland Security, and Janet Napolitano.
[03:48:10.825 --> 03:48:11.685]  Another lobbyist.
[03:48:11.685 --> 03:48:17.990]  He doesn't appoint anyone that isn't a lobbyist, and it's like 20, 30, 40 people deep in the command structure.
[03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:19.951]  This is the lobbyist administration.
[03:48:19.951 --> 03:48:22.933]  Yes, and then you have the head of the CIA, Lou Panetta.
[03:48:22.933 --> 03:48:23.534]  Leon Panetta.
[03:48:27.376 --> 03:48:31.540]  I mean, he is the biggest, and he's rated as the biggest Wall Street lobbyist in the world.
[03:48:31.540 --> 03:48:35.384]  Yeah, I mean, you know, what the heck is this guy doing head of the CIA?
[03:48:35.384 --> 03:48:42.551]  But the CIA and the Pentagon and the Treasury and the IMF are all one organization.
[03:48:42.551 --> 03:48:47.116]  These folks are the power elite mafia.
[03:48:47.116 --> 03:48:48.958]  Democrat, Republican,
[03:48:49.793 --> 03:48:51.294]  They're all Mafia up there.
[03:48:51.294 --> 03:48:56.817]  If you can't look at Joe Biden and see that he's a Mafia Don, then you're not paying attention.
[03:48:56.817 --> 03:49:07.342]  Now, the one appointment that gets under my skin, perhaps more than anybody else, is the fellow who walks around at his right hand hip 24-7.
[03:49:07.342 --> 03:49:15.226]  The guy who is in his room at 6 in the morning and who stays with him until 11 o'clock at night.
[03:49:15.226 --> 03:49:16.066]  Rahm Emanuel.
[03:49:16.066 --> 03:49:17.387]  Rahm Emanuel.
[03:49:18.413 --> 03:49:22.516]  Folks, if you don't know about Brother Rahm Emanuel, guy is, he's brilliant.
[03:49:22.516 --> 03:49:25.518]  He went to Nutrier High School up in North Chicago.
[03:49:25.518 --> 03:49:28.580]  He's absolutely a brilliant guy.
[03:49:28.580 --> 03:49:32.342]  He's hard, he's a hard worker.
[03:49:32.342 --> 03:49:35.284]  There's, you know, and he knows the political ranks.
[03:49:35.284 --> 03:49:38.266]  His father was a pay, was an assassin.
[03:49:39.642 --> 03:49:43.724]  Before Israel was a country, he would kill British and voice.
[03:49:43.724 --> 03:49:45.725]  Not just Palestinians.
[03:49:45.725 --> 03:49:47.446]  He wouldn't just kill Palestinians.
[03:49:47.446 --> 03:49:49.047]  He would kill Brits.
[03:49:49.047 --> 03:49:52.689]  And not that one is more valuable, you know, a Brit is not more valuable.
[03:49:52.689 --> 03:49:54.770]  Well, he was one of the heads of the Ergon terror groups.
[03:49:54.770 --> 03:49:56.051]  Absolutely he is.
[03:49:56.051 --> 03:50:01.134]  Most of Rahm Emanuel's family has dual citizenship with Israel.
[03:50:01.134 --> 03:50:04.816]  He is the political Zionist Zionist.
[03:50:06.340 --> 03:50:09.564]  And a lot of people don't know what political Zionism is.
[03:50:09.564 --> 03:50:12.047]  It's not about anti-Semitism.
[03:50:12.047 --> 03:50:13.929]  It's not about being Jewish.
[03:50:13.929 --> 03:50:16.152]  It's not about anything like that.
[03:50:16.152 --> 03:50:21.919]  It is a group of people who believe that they are the chosen ones and who have this false persona
[03:50:22.620 --> 03:50:29.846]  And who have absolute total control of the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, and what's going on.
[03:50:29.846 --> 03:50:33.269]  Rahm Emanuel, right now, wants to nuke Iran.
[03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:37.353]  Not just the military bases, he wants to nuke Tehran.
[03:50:37.353 --> 03:50:41.337]  And he wants compulsory national service, on record for us to be government slaves.
[03:50:41.337 --> 03:50:41.737]  Stay there.
[03:50:41.737 --> 03:50:42.598]  Final segment, George.
[03:50:42.598 --> 03:50:48.223]  We're going to interview you after the show for the film, and probably use some of this for the film, so we can get to go back over all this again as we get off.
[03:50:48.923 --> 03:50:55.546]  Uh, and more, but, uh, to try to go through all the- I mean, you've got the Deputy Secretary of Defense, was the top Raytheon lobbyist.
[03:50:55.546 --> 03:50:58.227]  Uh, he's continuing the torture, blocked the British from stopping it.
[03:50:58.227 --> 03:50:59.007]  Yep.
[03:50:59.007 --> 03:51:00.348]  Uh, he just lies about everything.
[03:51:01.499 --> 03:51:09.948]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[03:51:09.948 --> 03:51:20.679]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins.
[03:51:20.919 --> 03:51:25.082]  And helps provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout.
[03:51:25.082 --> 03:51:30.005]  Nutriodine is made with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine.
[03:51:30.005 --> 03:51:33.167]  Nutriodine should be used by all ages every day.
[03:51:33.167 --> 03:51:37.050]  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid, and mitochondria function.
[03:51:37.050 --> 03:51:39.431]  Or if you just want to feel better from day to day.
[03:51:39.431 --> 03:51:41.392]  Nutriodine drops are for you.
[03:51:41.392 --> 03:51:43.254]  There are several forms of iodine.
[03:51:43.254 --> 03:51:45.535]  Nutriodine is the only trusted source.
[03:51:45.655 --> 03:51:45.915]  We're good.
[03:52:01.784 --> 03:52:04.645]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[03:52:04.645 --> 03:52:06.205]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:52:06.205 --> 03:52:08.365]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:52:08.365 --> 03:52:10.266]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:10.266 --> 03:52:11.746]  The late great USA.
[03:52:11.746 --> 03:52:13.526]  America, freedom to fascism.
[03:52:13.526 --> 03:52:20.528]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[03:53:19.356 --> 03:53:25.380]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:53:25.380 --> 03:53:28.803]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:53:28.803 --> 03:53:33.446]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:53:33.446 --> 03:53:36.308]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,

[03:54:15.484 --> 03:54:19.006]  Are you going to live up a little bit to your ancestors' standard?
[03:54:19.006 --> 03:54:23.289]  Or are you going to be way down below it?
[03:54:23.289 --> 03:54:28.153]  Yeah, we're taking fight!
[03:54:28.153 --> 03:54:30.614]  We're never going to give it up!
[03:54:30.614 --> 03:54:32.976]  We're standing tall!
[03:54:32.976 --> 03:54:35.998]  We're getting up there in the catapult!
[03:54:35.998 --> 03:54:36.619]  Ha ha!
[03:54:39.392 --> 03:54:41.314]  Yeah, Alex, you are so cool.
[03:54:41.314 --> 03:54:43.275]  Hey, man, you gotta get fired up!
[03:54:43.275 --> 03:54:44.115]  You do, man.
[03:54:44.115 --> 03:54:46.257]  It's exciting fighting this tyranny.
[03:54:46.257 --> 03:54:48.739]  You know, it's... Really being alive.
[03:54:48.739 --> 03:54:50.560]  This is where the action is.
[03:54:50.560 --> 03:55:03.909]  Where else, what other thing can you talk about except about freedom, the protection of your country, the protection of your family, the stopping of these pirates, and then you make all these great new friends...
[03:55:04.970 --> 03:55:10.155]  And then it opens you up to all sorts of different concepts.
[03:55:10.155 --> 03:55:12.598]  And this is what's called the First Awakening.
[03:55:12.598 --> 03:55:21.706]  The awareness that the whole political and economic structure is totally manipulated and that there are pirates in control of the ship.
[03:55:22.527 --> 03:55:29.136]  And then, so, we learn about ways to deal with this, and then, is the spiritual aspect of this.
[03:55:29.136 --> 03:55:34.142]  Because, quite clearly, they've got more guns, they've got more money, they've got more soldiers.
[03:55:34.142 --> 03:55:35.283]  Now, we're growing.
[03:55:35.283 --> 03:55:36.945]  But they have meant 90% of the fight is the mind.
[03:55:36.945 --> 03:55:37.606]  Absolutely.
[03:55:37.606 --> 03:55:39.509]  If we just refuse to get outside the box,
[03:55:40.029 --> 03:55:43.953]  Folks, you don't have to defeat the whole New World Order yourself in ten seconds.
[03:55:43.953 --> 03:55:45.695]  It's deciding you're not with it.
[03:55:45.695 --> 03:55:46.896]  It's a spiritual decision.
[03:55:46.896 --> 03:55:47.637]  Absolutely.
[03:55:47.637 --> 03:55:52.202]  It is a spiritual, psychological, mental decision.
[03:55:52.202 --> 03:55:54.544]  It is the law of intention.
[03:55:54.544 --> 03:55:59.169]  And if each one of us become aware of our own power,
[03:55:59.910 --> 03:56:03.373]  And the fact that God does not make junk.
[03:56:03.373 --> 03:56:05.015]  God doesn't make junk.
[03:56:05.015 --> 03:56:07.978]  Yeshua, Jesus, talked about taking control.
[03:56:07.978 --> 03:56:10.560]  He said, you'll do greater miracles than I will.
[03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:13.283]  Be people of peace, but be strong.
[03:56:13.283 --> 03:56:21.350]  And be aware that through the law of intention, the law of creation, the law of allowance, and the law of harmony,
[03:56:22.111 --> 03:56:25.793]  Is that we can create whatever type of world we want.
[03:56:25.793 --> 03:56:34.199]  Now, quite clearly, the wizards of the Illuminati, who are very, very advanced people, know about these universal laws.
[03:56:34.199 --> 03:56:43.424]  And they have been manipulating us through our food, through the chemtrails, through our education, through our media, to make us feel that we are victims.
[03:56:43.424 --> 03:56:45.285]  To make us feel that we are weak.
[03:56:45.285 --> 03:56:46.066]  To make us feel weak!
[03:56:46.266 --> 03:56:46.706]  Yes.
[03:56:46.706 --> 03:56:50.650]  But if you know you're under attack, you can actually use that attack to make yourself even stronger.
[03:56:50.650 --> 03:57:03.161]  Well, that's the first thing, is to get some power in your heart, to bring up that fire, but to also understand that this is going to be more like to win.
[03:57:03.161 --> 03:57:04.662]  And I'm here to win this thing.
[03:57:04.662 --> 03:57:05.824]  More like jujitsu?
[03:57:05.824 --> 03:57:07.065]  Not to be a martyr.
[03:57:08.951 --> 03:57:21.755]  But, you know, if we go head-to-head with them right now, they're pretty tough, but it's like an Aikido match, and we're going to use their power, just like Cassius Clay or Muhammad Ali did the rope-a-dope against Foreman.
[03:57:21.755 --> 03:57:27.177]  We let them use their power for them to dissipate their power.
[03:57:27.177 --> 03:57:30.858]  9-11, as horrible and as tragic as it was, was a total failure for them.
[03:57:33.439 --> 03:57:38.881]  And it allowed us, people like you and I and many others, to get the message out.
[03:57:38.881 --> 03:57:41.542]  And at first, we were derided.
[03:57:41.542 --> 03:57:42.522]  People would laugh at us.
[03:57:42.522 --> 03:57:43.763]  But we were willing to commit.
[03:57:43.763 --> 03:57:46.244]  You know, I lost most of my affiliates when I did that.
[03:57:46.244 --> 03:57:47.164]  And we built them back up.
[03:57:47.164 --> 03:57:49.765]  Now that I'm bashing Obama, some affiliates are dropping.
[03:57:49.765 --> 03:57:51.105]  I could care less.
[03:57:51.105 --> 03:57:57.708]  It's about the truth and never compromising and knowing that we'll reach even more down the road when it's proven that we were right.
[03:57:57.708 --> 03:58:00.329]  George Humphrey, we're going to do an interview here now after the show.
[03:58:01.149 --> 03:58:02.070]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:05.714]  We had two state reps on today from New Hampshire.
[03:58:05.714 --> 03:58:06.514]  Very powerful.
[03:58:06.514 --> 03:58:07.876]  We had Bob Chapman on.
[03:58:07.876 --> 03:58:13.982]  I covered this amazing, is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago?
[03:58:13.982 --> 03:58:17.285]  I covered that at the bottom of the next hour and at the start I got into
[03:58:18.186 --> 03:58:23.970]  Now, they're coming into everybody's houses in Austin and businesses and putting in remote control thermostats.
[03:58:23.970 --> 03:58:26.792]  You gotta say no to them coming in your house and doing this, folks.
[03:58:26.792 --> 03:58:27.993]  They got the same thing in California.
[03:58:27.993 --> 03:58:32.115]  So that's coming up in the retransmission right now at OnePlaceInfoWars.com.
[03:58:32.115 --> 03:58:35.638]  See you back this Sunday with guests on the Chicago camps.
[03:58:35.638 --> 03:58:36.238]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:36.238 --> 03:58:37.399]  George, thank you.
[03:58:37.399 --> 03:58:39.861]  Hey, brother.
[03:58:39.861 --> 03:58:40.381]  That's it.
[03:58:40.381 --> 03:58:42.783]  Transmission starts now.
[03:58:42.783 --> 03:58:44.524]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:47.558 --> 03:58:51.862]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.862 --> 03:58:52.483]  Hello, friends.
[03:58:52.483 --> 03:58:53.564]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.564 --> 03:58:58.308]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.308 --> 03:59:01.271]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.271 --> 03:59:04.314]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.314 --> 03:59:09.018]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.238 --> 03:59:10.380]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.380 --> 03:59:13.623]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.623 --> 03:59:20.612]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
