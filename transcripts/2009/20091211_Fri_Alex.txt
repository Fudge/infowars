[00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:06.068]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:07.790]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.611]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:11.093]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:12.775]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.415 --> 00:00:17.059]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.664]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:41.691]  We are live on this Friday the 11th day of December 2009 and out of the gates we are simulcasting the full four hours of this Friday radio show live in living color via television at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:54.481]  Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to join us in the next segment but they are voting today up on Capitol Hill so that may fluctuate as routinely when he is on Capitol Hill.
[00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:02.500]  You know, I've talked for years about how the global government plan is only the beginning.
[00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:26.759]  The United Nations documents, the Club of Rome documents, Council on Foreign Relations, State Department memorandums, biological diversity assessments, hundreds of government-funded textbooks, call for a planetary regime, that's a quote, planetary police state government, that's a quote, planetary dictatorship, that's a quote, to carry out eugenics.
[00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:29.542]  This is what makes the whole world tick.
[00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.603]  It's why the license plate reading cameras are going in.
[00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:37.105]  It's why the CPS is interrogating all of your children and training them to spy on you.
[00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.446]  It's why the family is under attack.
[00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:46.168]  It's why our industrial society has been de-industrialized by design, publicly announced by the United Nations.
[00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.870]  And we're now going into the next, deeper phase of this.
[00:01:51.189 --> 00:02:04.813]  The Chinese government officially yesterday, in the largest paper in the country and at the Copenhagen Summit, called for a planetary regime to force a one-child policy to begin with.
[00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:18.797]  Simultaneously, papers across the world, TV, news networks and others, called for a one-child policy to cut the carbon footprint, the deadly carbon dioxide now listed as a chemical toxin.
[00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:21.939]  Even though plants breathe it, humans exhale it.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:34.689]  And so we're going to be going over the latest on Climategate, the latest on the establishment of world government, and what this world's going to look like if these people succeed, and I want to break down the phases of control.
[00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:51.216]  It just has really hit me hard again last night and this morning how serious this is, how dire this is, how criminal and just viciously controlling and selfish the planetary controllers and their minions are.
[00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.813]  We need to have a call to arms peaceably in the Infowar.
[00:02:57.873 --> 00:02:59.254]  A call to the Infowar.
[00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:03.798]  To really call these people out for what they are, bloodthirsty killers.
[00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.461]  They're already killing people all over the planet, thanks to starvation and cutting off water supplies.
[00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:15.567]  And I want to detail their plan today, after Congressman Ron Paul leaves us.
[00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:24.357]  Of course, Bob Chapman will give us his once a week visit on the economy as well as he does every Friday for part of the third hour.
[00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:27.678]  We'll also have open phones later in the broadcast.
[00:03:27.698 --> 00:03:28.859]  They're not open yet.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.201]  But here is the mainstream news article, China Daily.
[00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:36.162]  That's their big paper, government paper.
[00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:39.443]  Population control called key to deal.
[00:03:40.383 --> 00:03:44.025]  China says they'll sign on if the new planetary government
[00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:48.069]  Implements a one-child policy.
[00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:55.235]  So we're going to be going over that after we come back.
[00:03:55.295 --> 00:04:02.921]  Also, the National Post out of Canada says, the real inconvenient truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:07.826]  Scores of other papers are announcing children are evil carbon blobs.
[00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:14.366]  And of course, ABC News is reporting that children are being taught in public schools under a U.N.
[00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:19.669]  program with UNESCO when they should die, that their carbon credits run out at age 11.
[00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:26.037]  And of course, the National ID Card under treaty will keep a tally of your carbon credits.
[00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:28.238]  So that is all going into place.
[00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:29.359]  We're going to go to a quick break.
[00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.741]  We have Congressman Ron Paul on the line with us from Washington.
[00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:38.082]  And we'll go directly to Congressman Ron Paul on a host of issues.
[00:04:38.443 --> 00:04:40.023]  Government takeover of health care.
[00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:43.045]  His audit of the Fed bill.
[00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:46.387]  Obama getting the peace prize.
[00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:52.592]  The communist Chinese calling for a planetary regime to enforce one-child policies.
[00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:59.237]  We'll talk to the congressman, the leader, in the fight for liberty and freedom globally, straight ahead.
[00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:06.192]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:14.655]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:19.436]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:30.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.483]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.983 --> 00:05:46.025]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:53.608]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:56.649]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:05.448]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.808 --> 00:06:08.812]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:13.817]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:20.084]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:22.487]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:24.147]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:24.928]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:27.288]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.912 --> 00:06:43.754]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:48.900]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:58.310]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.568]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:08.949]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:11.029]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:16.171]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:17.311]  How much do you want?
[00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:18.271]  When do you want it?
[00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:20.252]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:20.552 --> 00:07:21.372]  When will you need it?
[00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:23.672]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:23.812 --> 00:07:24.913]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.473]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:26.673 --> 00:07:31.756]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:35.137]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:39.039]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:40.340]  How much will you need?
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.200]  We don't know.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.401]  How much do you want?
[00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:43.301]  All you can get.
[00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:44.302]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:47.363]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:47.643 --> 00:07:49.824]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.865]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:51.165]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:08.357]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:10.198]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:11.660]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.341]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:17.664]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:22.228]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:27.177]  Okay, we've got him until the bottom of the hour, unless the bell rings.
[00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:29.339]  There's a vote at 12.30 Eastern.
[00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:33.201]  We've got Ron Paul for the next 20 minutes.
[00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:47.210]  I want to first play a clip for the Congressman of the Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, saying that the carbon tax and this treaty will be the birth of world governance.
[00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.796]  And then I want to play Al Gore saying the same thing and get the congressman's take out of the gates on that subject.
[00:08:53.076 --> 00:08:55.058]  Here is the new head of the EU.
[00:08:55.078 --> 00:09:01.906]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[00:09:02.927 --> 00:09:09.314]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[00:09:10.538 --> 00:09:13.102]  Okay, and he goes on for many minutes after that.
[00:09:13.162 --> 00:09:18.268]  Here's Al Gore saying that environmentalism is the key to global governance.
[00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:21.953]  Here is Al Gore, former Vice President Al Gore.
[00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:24.937]  But it is the awareness itself.
[00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:34.132]  That will drive the change, and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements.
[00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:34.833]  Okay.
[00:09:34.853 --> 00:09:38.893]  Congressman, for 30 years you've warned of global government reading their own documents.
[00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:52.796]  I have the Danish text leaked of the treaty calling for global governance, a global authority over all air travel, over the oceans, 2% tax, flat tax on all GDPs, paid to the IMF and World Bank,
[00:09:53.556 --> 00:09:55.837]  Effectively abolishing the UN's power.
[00:09:55.897 --> 00:09:57.158]  The UN is freaking out.
[00:09:57.478 --> 00:09:59.379]  Private, corporate, global governance.
[00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:03.040]  Congressman, there's no longer any denial about this, is there?
[00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:11.484]  No way, and in a way it may serve to our benefit because the people are going to wake up just as our federal government fails.
[00:10:11.524 --> 00:10:20.548]  You know, we hear more about nullification and secession, and I figure that when the federal government fails or the money fails, there's going to be a lot of independence declared.
[00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:30.073]  So even though they're bold and they're making these plans, they're not going to be effective and it may serve our purpose in waking up the people.
[00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:46.039]  They've been pushing this for a good many years, but 20 years ago approximately, when the Soviet system collapsed, they quit using the word socialism, but they shifted over toward this environmental effort, claiming that they could get government control through this.
[00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:54.902]  And they have done an amazing job infiltrating our public school system and indoctrinating our young kids and young kids going home.
[00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:56.063]  We're good.
[00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:32.072]  I've interviewed literally hundreds of reporters that have been at these different globalist summits, including five or six the last few days at Copenhagen, and they say that there's a sense of desperation and panic by the big banks, predominantly, that are funding this private corporate global government.
[00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:47.841]  Sir, do you agree with me, or perhaps you can elaborate on the fact that now that they've been revealed, because we did our job in the face of ridicule and exposed their global government plan, that now because they've been exposed, they're coming out in the open and being more bold and honest about it.
[00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:49.862]  I mean, what's your take on why they're so bold?
[00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.463]  Well, I think that could be it.
[00:11:51.503 --> 00:12:01.189]  They have to be more aggressive, but in many ways, though, people are backing off from this because some major candidates have been
[00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:10.191]  You know, supporters of trade, cap and trade, and have taken their names off the bill, so they're starting to understand this.
[00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:13.734]  Same way with, you know, Audit the Fed thing.
[00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:19.298]  You know, just look how the establishment come down hard, and Bernanke hiring lobbyists and him writing editorials.
[00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.820]  It hasn't seemed to help their side.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.181]  They're still on the defensive.
[00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:27.064]  But we are in a struggle, there is no doubt, and they are going to get tougher.
[00:12:27.874 --> 00:12:37.801]  And right now too many of them have too much power in different governments and if they take this next step that they can exert power with a world government and a world military
[00:12:38.583 --> 00:13:01.203]  Uh, which is partially here already, then we're in very big trouble, but I tend to want to be more optimistic, thinking that the people will wake up and we have the tools, still the radio, hopefully that'll last, and still we have the internet, hopefully that'll last, but they're capable of closing us down, so this is vital that we wake up as many people as possible as quickly as possible.
[00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:09.262]  Congressman, you brought up the fact that the Senate is now saying they're probably not going to ratify the treaty, even if Obama signs it.
[00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:17.248]  That may be a red herring to make us stand down, but then it looks like it may be real because, as you know, Obama, two days ago, was in the Associated Press.
[00:13:17.548 --> 00:13:24.894]  Headline, Obama threatens command and control and tells Congress, the real boss in our system of government,
[00:13:25.034 --> 00:13:28.496]  Yeah, and that goes to show what they can do, you know, on the system that we've allowed to be created.
[00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:45.300]  You know, the executive branch has tremendous powers, and the courts won't help us.
[00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:55.351]  They write regulations, they have the force of law, and it reminds me of that statement, stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool, and that's how powerful presidents are.
[00:13:55.391 --> 00:14:00.537]  They write executive orders, they write signing statements, and they do what they want.
[00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:13.499]  And this is why the movement is getting very, very disgusted and saying, you know, they keep talking about nullification and secession and that growth is going to continue.
[00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.500]  Congressman, is it not
[00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:29.192]  An impeachable offense to have the White House telling Congress, if you don't ratify a treaty, handing our control over to the IMF and World Bank, now in the treaty, for all of these unlimited taxes.
[00:14:29.232 --> 00:14:38.194]  They say they have the power to just raise any taxes they want, selectively enforce regulations to the benefit of that inner coterie of global robber barons.
[00:14:38.434 --> 00:14:45.155]  I mean, is this not an impeachable offense if Obama attempts to supersede the will of the Congress?
[00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:48.852]  Well, it certainly deserves a lot of attention.
[00:14:48.912 --> 00:14:50.853]  I don't know whether it's going to be put in that category.
[00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:53.715]  It's not going to happen, because they've been doing it for so long.
[00:14:54.535 --> 00:14:58.237]  It means that, you know, everybody in the Congress is guilty.
[00:14:58.377 --> 00:15:02.859]  You know, everybody in the executive branch is guilty, and just about everybody in the judicial system is guilty.
[00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:12.404]  So that's not going to happen, and I guess to many of it is a high crime, and it should be looked at.
[00:15:12.684 --> 00:15:14.505]  But that's not going to happen.
[00:15:15.461 --> 00:15:23.828]  I mean, we have to just change the understanding by more and more people on what we have to replace what we have right now.
[00:15:23.908 --> 00:15:25.189]  Well, how do we block it then?
[00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:37.058]  How do we block a president acting as a dictator under Presidential Decision Directive 51 and others saying, I'll do whatever I want, I'll hand America over to the United Nations and IMF and World Bank?
[00:15:37.858 --> 00:15:44.624]  Well, if they get to that point where, you know, it's literally so, right now they would argue the case against that.
[00:15:44.684 --> 00:15:48.767]  But, you know, I think that subtly we're moving in that direction.
[00:15:48.787 --> 00:15:53.792]  But this would all stop if we had the right numbers.
[00:15:54.392 --> 00:15:59.937]  This Congress would be eliminated and we'd have different people here and they would be passing legislation.
[00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:05.875]  And then if the public was, you know, on our side, then the president couldn't do it just because of public pressure.
[00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:10.496]  The president isn't going to march next weekend and take your gun.
[00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:13.797]  He might like to, and he might be moving in that direction, but he's not going to do it.
[00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:14.377]  There's a limit.
[00:16:14.777 --> 00:16:16.778]  Public opinion is not going to let that happen.
[00:16:17.638 --> 00:16:23.580]  So public opinion is what really, really counts and puts up the resistance, you know, to what they're doing.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.141]  And we're moving in that direction, and it's much better.
[00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:33.525]  But it won't be a technical matter of throwing the president out.
[00:16:35.909 --> 00:16:39.995]  The mentality here in Washington isn't even considering anything like that.
[00:16:40.215 --> 00:16:43.660]  The American people have to change the nature of Congress before anything else will happen.
[00:16:44.093 --> 00:16:46.455]  But you do sound optimistic.
[00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:51.980]  I mean, I'm seeing a giant awakening that just continues to mushroom and accelerate exponentially.
[00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:54.583]  Are you seeing the same thing from your position, sir?
[00:16:54.923 --> 00:16:55.323]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16:55.484 --> 00:16:58.626]  I think every time I go out, I get more encouraged.
[00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:05.092]  And, you know, I do go to the campus and talk to young people because I think that's so crucial.
[00:17:05.132 --> 00:17:08.756]  And I think real revolutions occur with young people.
[00:17:09.281 --> 00:17:15.023]  So I see it not only with college kids, but even kids younger that are getting interested in their reading.
[00:17:15.043 --> 00:17:18.264]  They're so far ahead of what I was thinking about when I was in college.
[00:17:18.324 --> 00:17:21.685]  I was doing pre-med, and that's what I was concentrating on.
[00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:27.266]  But now I have a lot of college kids and high school kids coming in, and they're intensely interested in this.
[00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:31.307]  They're interested in the Federal Reserve, and they're studying, and they're reading Austrian economics.
[00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:35.008]  So their numbers are growing, and that's what we have to encourage.
[00:17:37.496 --> 00:17:41.118]  I see it as an ideological struggle rather than a political struggle.
[00:17:41.158 --> 00:17:48.381]  The political stuff comes if you convince enough people that it's in their best interest to get rid of big government.
[00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:50.102]  You know, get rid of the monetary system.
[00:17:50.122 --> 00:17:51.203]  Absolutely, that's the source.
[00:17:51.223 --> 00:17:52.023]  Foreign policy.
[00:17:52.323 --> 00:17:54.064]  So it's an ideological struggle.
[00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:56.405]  That, to me, is the most important thing.
[00:17:57.245 --> 00:18:00.189]  Absolutely, and so we are starting to gain ground on that front.
[00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:14.445]  Lastly, on the environment front, China is saying they will support the Copenhagen establishment of world government if a global government, and this is out of China Daily, will carry out one-child policies in the West.
[00:18:15.106 --> 00:18:17.988]  And we have the National Post calling for that.
[00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:21.891]  The good news is there are hundreds of comments on this National Post article out of Canada.
[00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:27.035]  Not one of them is in support of these Malthusian control freak views.
[00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:38.404]  But from my studies, Congressman, at the heart of the global government is a control freak wish to establish a neo-Malthusian eugenics system on the planet.
[00:18:38.424 --> 00:18:39.605]  Can you comment on the call?
[00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:42.647]  I think the radical environmentalists would go along with that.
[00:18:42.987 --> 00:18:44.248]  But they're in a small minority.
[00:18:44.288 --> 00:18:45.768]  They're losing credibility.
[00:18:45.788 --> 00:18:48.990]  American people aren't going to buy into this.
[00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:55.053]  So I think it's fine for them to make those announcements because I think that's awakening.
[00:18:55.733 --> 00:19:02.397]  That will serve to awaken the people because that is so extreme and so radical and so un-American.
[00:19:03.637 --> 00:19:06.379]  If we don't wake up, then it's our own darn fault.
[00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:10.841]  You know, if we hear that kind of talk and then go ahead and sign these treaties,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.685]  And then find out there's a world government trying to enforce these things.
[00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:21.110]  I mean, there are movements for world governments to regulate guns and everything else.
[00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:32.142]  So, I mean, if we get that far, you know, we almost deserve it if we're so stupid as not to wake up and do something about it.
[00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:34.372]  Well, Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[00:19:34.412 --> 00:19:37.115]  We have the full text of the treaty in the Danish addendum.
[00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:52.347]  It states that it is a global government, a regulatory system over all air traffic, 2% tax on all the GDP off the top, huge taxes on fuels, taxes on meat, taxes on methane, taxes on light bulbs, television sets, freon.
[00:19:52.948 --> 00:19:57.732]  I mean, this is tens of trillions of dollars a year to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:19:58.888 --> 00:20:01.069]  Yeah, that's grandiose.
[00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:10.452]  I just don't think it's going to happen because the people will rebel, and that will be a tremendous boost to the underground economy.
[00:20:10.692 --> 00:20:13.734]  You know, they're just not going to do it.
[00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.674]  I think the underground economy is growing all the time.
[00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.415]  Our own government does it to us.
[00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.716]  Our own local governments do these things to us.
[00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:25.398]  It's too much regulation, too much taxation, too much abuse of our freedoms, and people are so sick and tired of it.
[00:20:25.962 --> 00:20:42.970]  If all of a sudden they see on some bill someplace that their taxes are going up to pay for world government, it's just going to incense them and survival comes from ignoring the burden of big government and when the government
[00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.434]  The system breaks down.
[00:20:45.454 --> 00:20:52.056]  I believe that breaking down comes when the dollar quits functioning, and that's still a couple years off.
[00:20:52.116 --> 00:21:00.420]  But when it comes, people have to survive, and they're going to survive without begging and pleading and bowing to the federal government or the United Nations.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:07.243]  And meanwhile, Congressman, the USA Today reports $77,000 a year on average for government employees.
[00:21:07.283 --> 00:21:09.504]  They're all getting big pay increases.
[00:21:09.524 --> 00:21:11.685]  There are more police out riding tickets.
[00:21:11.725 --> 00:21:17.347]  Government's growing like a cancer and celebrating the fact that it's taking control of the economy.
[00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:22.690]  I want to just get a final comment on the ClimateGate emails where they're hiding the decline.
[00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.712]  The head climate research center in collusion to defraud the public.
[00:21:28.392 --> 00:21:31.394]  Are you calling for a congressional investigation as Senator Inhofe is?
[00:21:32.095 --> 00:21:33.816]  Well, I would certainly support it.
[00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:35.637]  I haven't particularly done this.
[00:21:36.297 --> 00:21:43.242]  Sometimes investigations are used to cover up things and I don't get all that excited about them getting to the source of it.
[00:21:43.562 --> 00:21:48.305]  The source, the answers for this and the source will be outside of Washington.
[00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:52.468]  Washington is not going to very often give you the truth.
[00:21:53.739 --> 00:22:03.566]  If we have a chance to do that, fine and dandy, but since some of this stuff is overseas, there's a limit to finding out all the information that you have to have.
[00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:07.589]  But we've benefited tremendously by this exposure.
[00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:13.673]  It wasn't the government that told us what was going on, and now this information is out and the numbers are shifting.
[00:22:13.853 --> 00:22:14.554]  People are now
[00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:21.892]  Much more reluctant to go along with some of this, so the resistance is building, so we're already benefiting by it.
[00:22:21.932 --> 00:22:25.415]  Yes, and now more fraud is pouring out of universities globally.
[00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:28.057]  They're being caught and more whistleblowers are coming forward.
[00:22:29.078 --> 00:22:35.564]  On the subject of the Peace Prize, Obama has had two big troop surges now in Afghanistan, keeping the troops
[00:22:36.344 --> 00:22:44.571]  Yeah, one part of that speech that really annoyed me was that he described it as being a just war, harping back to the Christian just war theory, and for him to try to claim
[00:23:04.745 --> 00:23:11.770]  He's calling just war theory, which was originally Christian oriented, is so far removed from reality.
[00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:17.635]  And of course, he claims as one of his heroes is Gandhi, who really believed in peace.
[00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:20.036]  So it is so hypocritical.
[00:23:23.365 --> 00:23:27.848]  You know, the fact that the American people don't seem to be catching on to this.
[00:23:28.268 --> 00:23:31.770]  Unfortunately, for a while they're going to support more troops over there.
[00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:39.033]  Although our numbers are starting to build and we're doing more right now here in the Congress to try to call more attention to this.
[00:23:39.313 --> 00:23:49.759]  Kucinich and a few of us have introduced legislation that will challenge his whole effort over there, including the Bush effort, under the War Powers Resolution.
[00:23:50.427 --> 00:24:00.594]  You know, even though he got some authority after 9-11, it wasn't the kind of authority that they had been using for these eight years to occupy and take over the whole government and the whole country.
[00:24:01.244 --> 00:24:02.325]  Absolutely, Congressman.
[00:24:02.385 --> 00:24:11.749]  As you know, the polls show the war is at an all-time unpopularity level, and so certainly people are waking up to that.
[00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:15.310]  And this has really blown up in their face, giving him a peace prize.
[00:24:16.271 --> 00:24:23.574]  Shifting gears into government-run health care, are we in danger of this power grab taking place?
[00:24:24.318 --> 00:24:27.903]  Yeah, that one, I'm always looking for a place for optimism.
[00:24:27.963 --> 00:24:32.228]  I guess I'm less optimistic about anything decent coming out of the healthcare.
[00:24:32.248 --> 00:24:33.990]  I think it's going to get worse.
[00:24:35.452 --> 00:24:37.835]  The people in this country accept incrementalism.
[00:24:38.357 --> 00:24:40.178]  Medical care is seen somewhat different.
[00:24:40.198 --> 00:24:46.800]  They don't see that the same principles of liberty apply to medical care as they do to their Second Amendment and their First Amendment rights.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.601]  So, I mean, you think health care is going to pass as things stand right now?
[00:24:49.681 --> 00:24:50.721]  Yeah, to some degree.
[00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:55.583]  Whether they keep all this on and they're not going to get total control, but they're going to have more control.
[00:24:55.903 --> 00:24:57.683]  The quality of health care is going to tell.
[00:24:57.743 --> 00:25:03.385]  Quarter million dollar fines, five years in prison, 41 billion dollar cut to Medicare.
[00:25:03.425 --> 00:25:04.806]  I mean, how is that liberal?
[00:25:05.746 --> 00:25:06.386]  It's pretty bad.
[00:25:06.787 --> 00:25:17.672]  And then the other big thing that I imagine by the time the deaths settle, they will undermine the ability to get a medical savings account.
[00:25:17.712 --> 00:25:29.078]  Because right now, if you really want to take care of yourself, you can go out and get a medical savings account, pay for all your local bills, your doctor bills, and put money in the savings account and get a tax benefit from this.
[00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:42.097]  If, no matter what they did, if that was available to the people where they had the chance to just walk away from the system, but this crowd up here now is not interested in protecting your right to... They want control over people, don't they?
[00:25:42.137 --> 00:25:51.563]  Yeah, it's the same way, you know, Medicare, even though those medical savings accounts are a good idea, if you're 65 or over and you're in Medicare, you don't have a choice of that.
[00:25:51.603 --> 00:25:55.665]  So they started by mandating everybody be in it because they need your money.
[00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.713]  There's going to be a lot more of that.
[00:25:58.073 --> 00:26:02.784]  I can't find room for optimism about what's happening in the medical
[00:26:03.513 --> 00:26:12.538]  Well, that is devastating news from one of the only medical doctors in Congress and an economist award-winning, Congressman Ron Paul, telling us that it looks like it's going to pass.
[00:26:12.598 --> 00:26:18.301]  Folks, you better do whatever you can to stop this and let Harry Reid and others know they're not going to get re-elected if they do this.
[00:26:18.641 --> 00:26:20.622]  In closing, Congressman, some good news.
[00:26:21.243 --> 00:26:22.863]  You got 311 sponsors.
[00:26:22.924 --> 00:26:23.984]  It's passed out of committee.
[00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:25.165]  Audit the Fed.
[00:26:25.185 --> 00:26:25.945]  The Fed's admitted.
[00:26:26.005 --> 00:26:27.666]  You audit us, you'll destroy us.
[00:26:28.206 --> 00:26:31.628]  In the last three minutes we've got left, sir, auditing the Fed.
[00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:32.749]  Give us a report on that.
[00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:41.150]  Okay, I think most know that last week it was put into a bank regulation bill, which is a monster of a bill.
[00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:47.095]  When it came out of the committee, I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good things when there's a lot of bad things in it.
[00:26:47.155 --> 00:26:52.319]  But my amendment won by 42 to 26, which was a major victory.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.561]  It's on the House floor at this moment.
[00:26:54.681 --> 00:26:56.603]  It will be voted on at the end of the day.
[00:26:57.308 --> 00:27:06.210]  And the auditing provision in both the Republican version and the Democratic version, the Democratic version will pass, and the auditing provision will be in there.
[00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:15.613]  The real work needs to be done in the Senate, so if anybody knows where their Senator stands, try to urge the Senators to get on that same bill.
[00:27:15.673 --> 00:27:19.874]  I think it's 604, and there's 30 in over there.
[00:27:19.934 --> 00:27:26.176]  There's been several Senators that have put a hold on Bernanke's reappointment, unless
[00:27:27.424 --> 00:27:33.169]  Uh, unless they, um, have a vote on, uh, 1207, the auditing bill, in the Senate.
[00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.433]  So, sir, this is a massive victory.
[00:27:36.453 --> 00:27:43.099]  I mean, today it looks like they're gonna probably pass it in the House, it'll go to the Senate, and then the fight's in the Senate.
[00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.381]  This is incredible news!
[00:27:45.114 --> 00:27:46.915]  Yeah, it's big.
[00:27:47.235 --> 00:27:50.076]  We have no idea, you know, exactly what will happen.
[00:27:50.116 --> 00:27:54.497]  There'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate, and the Fed still has time to do all that they do.
[00:27:54.977 --> 00:27:59.659]  But nevertheless, I think you're correct in describing this as a major victory for the people.
[00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:03.240]  I mean, the grassroots got this done.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.760]  I didn't twist arms.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.761]  I have no clout up here in that sense.
[00:28:07.341 --> 00:28:12.863]  But we have 313 on there, all Republicans and a lot of Democrats.
[00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:21.619]  It's really, it's a really great testament to what can happen when the people come together because this is not a conservative Republican bill.
[00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:27.909]  I mean, it's liberals and populists and libertarians and constitutionalists have all come around to believing
[00:28:28.385 --> 00:28:31.848]  Enough is enough, and the Fed is too big and too secret.
[00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:37.712]  And we finally identified it as the real shadow government instead of Republican and Democrat puppets.
[00:28:37.732 --> 00:28:39.954]  You've been working for close to 30 years for this.
[00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:43.356]  Even if we don't have victory this year, we're a hair away.
[00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:46.959]  It'll be assured next year as the crisis accelerates.
[00:28:46.979 --> 00:28:47.980]  Do you agree with that?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.522]  Yeah, I don't think they'll be able to ever.
[00:28:50.982 --> 00:28:53.364]  If they squelch us, it'll just make it a bigger issue.
[00:28:53.926 --> 00:29:00.815]  And the problems are going to get worse and they will know where to look and they have to look to the Federal Reserve System to find a real source of our problems.
[00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:02.748]  Well, Congressman, I salute you.
[00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:06.411]  Your book is a bestseller in the Fed and bookstores and Amazon.com.
[00:29:06.831 --> 00:29:08.532]  I go to CampaignForLiberty.com.
[00:29:08.672 --> 00:29:11.234]  I go to all the great sites of Ron Paul supporting.
[00:29:11.674 --> 00:29:13.755]  Thank him for running for president a few years ago.
[00:29:13.815 --> 00:29:17.258]  That really helped focus this Coalition for Liberty and Freedom.
[00:29:17.278 --> 00:29:22.001]  And I know I'll talk to you again early next year, Congressman, with your once-a-month check-in with us.
[00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:23.242]  Thank you so much.
[00:29:23.662 --> 00:29:27.585]  And get out there and cast that vote for the bill you wrote and introduced.
[00:29:27.865 --> 00:29:28.765]  We salute you.
[00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:31.067]  And what a great Christmas gift, sir, you've given.
[00:29:31.067 --> 00:29:31.287]  Thank you.
[00:29:31.327 --> 00:29:32.267]  Good to talk to you.
[00:29:32.327 --> 00:29:34.068]  Thank you so much, Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:29:34.748 --> 00:29:37.308]  Absolutely amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:37.908 --> 00:29:39.109]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:29:39.349 --> 00:29:51.712]  Yeah, world government's coming in, but the war's on, we're fighting back, our numbers are growing, we're having victories, we're learning we can stand up against bullies, like when you finally go ahead and punch that bully in the nose, his nose breaks, he hits the ground.
[00:29:51.732 --> 00:29:54.472]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.392 --> 00:29:58.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.626 --> 00:30:07.468]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[00:32:00.342 --> 00:32:05.529]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:10.015]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:12.038]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:12.478 --> 00:32:13.840]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.122]  There is a solution.

[00:33:26.055 --> 00:33:27.756]  Climategate, devastating them.
[00:33:27.796 --> 00:33:30.477]  Their eugenics agenda out in the open, devastating them.
[00:33:31.377 --> 00:33:32.378]  Did you hear Ron Paul?
[00:33:32.418 --> 00:33:38.741]  He believes today the bill to audit the Fed, a strong bill to audit the private...
[00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:45.199]  Front Group, the private holding company for private banks, will be audited.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:52.445]  It will pass the House, and if the Senate doesn't pass it, it is going to devastate them politically, and it's frankly even better for us.
[00:33:52.946 --> 00:33:59.911]  Because everybody's going to say even more, why can't we audit the Fed, and everyone's going to discover that it is the real government.
[00:34:03.334 --> 00:34:04.395]  Now ladies and gentlemen,
[00:34:05.782 --> 00:34:09.826]  You heard Congressman Ron Paul on the day of the vote.
[00:34:11.428 --> 00:34:14.732]  He is literally going now to begin debate on the bill.
[00:34:17.174 --> 00:34:21.599]  And they've got the votes easily to pass this in the House of Representatives.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.461]  You want victory?
[00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:24.242]  You're getting it.
[00:34:25.443 --> 00:34:26.004]  And you heard him.
[00:34:26.184 --> 00:34:27.445]  Even if it doesn't pass the Senate.
[00:34:28.288 --> 00:34:29.329]  Next year it's assured.
[00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:31.230]  These guys are in so much trouble.
[00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.931]  You heard the bad news though.
[00:34:33.131 --> 00:34:40.255]  They're going to snatch 17% to 20% depending on what numbers you look at, but conservatively 17% of what's left of our free economy.
[00:34:42.196 --> 00:34:48.579]  The social, government, health care, eugenics, the case for killing granny as Newsweek called it, is probably going to pass.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.403]  Because they give us a tyrant like Bush, people backlash and put in the Democrats,
[00:34:55.649 --> 00:34:57.430]  They continue the New World Order agenda.
[00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.211]  We are in a lot of trouble, but we're fighting back.
[00:35:02.052 --> 00:35:05.334]  I'm going to open the phones up right now at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:05.354 --> 00:35:05.794]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:06.555 --> 00:35:17.020]  I'm going to take calls until 8 after next hour, and then I'm going to give a focused breakdown of the Globalist Master Plan.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.761]  Who they are, what they are.
[00:35:18.781 --> 00:35:22.563]  I normally, when I break things down, get stuck on little details.
[00:35:22.583 --> 00:35:24.404]  I'm going to give you just a basic rundown, and then
[00:35:25.692 --> 00:35:27.393]  Zoom in on just a few facets of it.
[00:35:27.413 --> 00:35:32.757]  I'm going to give you a general overview of these people and what their plan is and how we can beat them.
[00:35:34.438 --> 00:35:38.460]  There is an article that just went up on PrisonPlanet.com minutes ago.
[00:35:39.021 --> 00:35:43.904]  Furious reaction to sick editorial calling for global one-child dictatorship.
[00:35:44.884 --> 00:35:52.029]  Francis, the name of the author, advocates brutal regime that kidnaps, drugs women, and carries out forced abortions in China.
[00:35:53.865 --> 00:35:55.466]  This is a woman who has two children.
[00:35:57.969 --> 00:36:08.258]  But the point is, the Chinese government came out yesterday and said they want a global government for one-child policies.
[00:36:08.338 --> 00:36:10.660]  And think of how much debt we owe the Chinese.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.121]  Think of how they're the new superpower.
[00:36:12.341 --> 00:36:14.824]  The globalists chose them as the model of the planet
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:22.732]  To have prices so low they would bankrupt all other industry and only a select globalist can operate out of that country.
[00:36:23.132 --> 00:36:24.595]  This is monopoly formation.
[00:36:26.397 --> 00:36:49.592]  So I'm going to be going over that in the next hour, but an article featured in Canada's Financial Post newspaper calling for China's draconian one-child policy where women are kidnapped off the streets, drugged and forced to undergo compulsory abortions to be imposed worldwide has been met with widespread hostile reaction, yet such measures are being debated at the United Nations Climate Summit in Copenhagen to be part of the treaty.
[00:36:51.343 --> 00:36:56.225]  Now, this morning I read, it's gotta be more than 50 comments, I had to stop, I couldn't read them all.
[00:36:56.706 --> 00:37:08.291]  Every comment I read, every comment I read, and I printed them off right here, every comment disagreed with her.
[00:37:09.452 --> 00:37:13.213]  And they understood, they said, we know you want a world government, we know you want to sterilize us.
[00:37:13.494 --> 00:37:14.274]  I mean, they're admitting it!
[00:37:14.814 --> 00:37:18.296]  She calls for a global government, so does the official Chinese government.
[00:37:21.946 --> 00:37:26.591]  And I have news reporters here every day, and I sit here going, you know, there's a plan for a world government.
[00:37:27.312 --> 00:37:30.996]  Official government plans say they're spiking the water with sterilants right now.
[00:37:31.316 --> 00:37:36.882]  That's why the sperm counts drop over 85% in every country that fluoridates the water, because they don't just add fluoride.
[00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:43.163]  And they just look at me and start laughing and say, what, I guess you watch the movie Dr. Strangelove.
[00:37:43.864 --> 00:37:46.125]  I guess you're Jack T. Ripper, the crazed general.
[00:37:46.205 --> 00:37:50.026]  No, I'm reading what the White House science czar says they're doing.
[00:37:50.747 --> 00:37:53.788]  There's no more time to screw around and play games here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:57.249 --> 00:37:59.410]  All you petty bureaucrats on power trips.
[00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:06.694]  I mean, I've got USA Today today reporting record increases
[00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:09.995]  In government salaries nationwide.
[00:38:11.016 --> 00:38:13.338]  You are the hired thugs that carry out this crime.
[00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:16.900]  And you love your power.
[00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.942]  You love all the unconstitutional power.
[00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:20.123]  You love it.
[00:38:21.164 --> 00:38:24.567]  Don't you understand you're being targeted just like the rest of us?
[00:38:24.647 --> 00:38:26.709]  Can't you get that through your brains?
[00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.190]  That
[00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:35.595]  Maurice Strong and others at the UN said they want to destroy our industrial society through globalization.
[00:38:35.956 --> 00:38:37.437]  That's what Paul Ehrlich said.
[00:38:37.477 --> 00:38:39.039]  That's what John P. Holdren said.
[00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.881]  That's what they say over and over again.
[00:38:43.162 --> 00:38:49.989]  They want to wreck the economy so government can take over and then give almost all of our tax money to interest on debt to private banks.
[00:38:50.129 --> 00:38:51.490]  This is a criminal heist.
[00:38:53.812 --> 00:38:55.434]  Now I said I'm going to cover this next hour.
[00:38:57.708 --> 00:38:58.791]  Frankly, I'm procrastinating.
[00:38:58.832 --> 00:39:00.055]  It's such a monumental job.
[00:39:00.256 --> 00:39:02.984]  I meant to write a bunch of notes up before I cover this.
[00:39:03.045 --> 00:39:04.469]  I tried to start last night.
[00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:11.074]  I had family over for a little Christmas party, and as my children are playing in front of me, I couldn't even think about anything but this.
[00:39:11.455 --> 00:39:16.258]  How there's these murdering, tyrannical, bloodthirsty, savage criminals.
[00:39:16.358 --> 00:39:32.788]  I mean, just the UN's directory, and just the environmental push for ethanol, one-third of Brazil, the U.S., and several other countries planting crops for ethanol instead of food, has caused a doubling in world food prices, and now the numbers are in.
[00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:34.990]  Instead of 15 million starving to death last year,
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.781]  Over 25 million starved of death.
[00:39:37.801 --> 00:39:39.162]  That's 10 million people!
[00:39:39.602 --> 00:39:45.505]  You little creatures out there got through.
[00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:47.226]  I mean, look, feel good about yourselves.
[00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:50.628]  You want to walk around with your sandals and your patchouli and your liberalness?
[00:39:51.868 --> 00:39:52.749]  You are powerful.
[00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:58.152]  I know you at a subconscious level are attracted to shutting off people's power and food, and you really get off on it.
[00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:02.294]  And yes, you have helped kill more people in one year than Hitler did.
[00:40:03.905 --> 00:40:05.706]  And you're trying to eclipse Stalin and Mao.
[00:40:05.926 --> 00:40:06.667]  You got power!
[00:40:08.028 --> 00:40:14.332]  You got power because you look so stupid and so silly, everybody just makes fun of you and calls you environmentalist wackos.
[00:40:14.372 --> 00:40:15.332]  No, you're not wackos.
[00:40:15.632 --> 00:40:17.153]  You are the pale horse death.
[00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.334]  You are savage.
[00:40:18.574 --> 00:40:19.455]  You have power.
[00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:21.576]  And you are murdering people en masse.
[00:40:21.596 --> 00:40:22.457]  Congratulations.
[00:40:22.757 --> 00:40:23.698]  You wanted to be evil?
[00:40:24.378 --> 00:40:25.118]  You are evil.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:31.963]  Now, I want to tell the good people out there that have protection instinct in them, that have the instinct of love and honor.
[00:40:33.004 --> 00:40:34.367]  You gotta get focused.
[00:40:34.387 --> 00:40:41.942]  You gotta just set your jaw and just feel the energy of liberty and freedom against these people and set your will against them.
[00:40:43.063 --> 00:41:00.306]  You have to set your will against them and feel that humanity rise up in you against these people and feel the strength of our ancestors that stood against slavery and stood against degradation and pain and enslavement and starvation and all you need to go online and type in starving children.
[00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:01.486]  Type it in right now.
[00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:12.308]  Let's look at photos of starving children desperately falling into piles of fleas and flies and dying, being bulldozed into pits right now in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
[00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:29.329]  My uncle, when he was a helicopter pilot working in Latin America, described orphanages he would see with just hundreds of children starving to death with no food for them, with their ribs sticking out and pus dripping out of their eyes.
[00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:31.010]  Let me tell you something.
[00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:35.473]  You want to feel powerful, you little sicko, Nazi hippies?
[00:41:35.653 --> 00:41:38.335]  Feel powerful, you murdering scum!
[00:41:40.592 --> 00:41:48.334]  You go ahead and put your TerraPass stuff on your car saying you're buying carbon credits and believe the lie that you're helping the third world, cutting off their resources.
[00:41:48.694 --> 00:41:50.175]  A lot of you are just useful idiots.
[00:41:50.635 --> 00:41:58.377]  But a lot of you we talked to, Rob Jacobson at Whole Foods a few months ago, walked up, good looking girl behind the counter, he buys food there every few days fresh.
[00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:04.368]  He walks up, buys the case for killing Granny, Newsweek cover to bring it to me.
[00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:06.450]  He talks to her every few days.
[00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.371]  He says, look at this.
[00:42:07.951 --> 00:42:09.432]  She said, I think it's a great idea.
[00:42:09.492 --> 00:42:10.953]  I think we do need to start killing people.
[00:42:11.233 --> 00:42:12.995]  And he said, yeah, but they want to kill you too.
[00:42:13.035 --> 00:42:15.316]  And she said, yes, I want to die for the earth.
[00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:22.661]  She loves that power trip, that evil core, and she doesn't even know she's evil.
[00:42:23.722 --> 00:42:27.365]  And I want to tell her this, listen, kill yourself.
[00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:40.335]  Don't kill some little African kid, some little Latin American or Asian kid when the UN buses pull up and give payoffs to the locals to inject them with vaccines on record that cause miscarriages on the spot.
[00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:43.036]  Okay?
[00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:46.738]  You say there's too many people?
[00:42:47.518 --> 00:42:48.219]  Kill yourself!
[00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:49.419]  Kill yourself!
[00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:50.520]  Kill yourself!
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.300]  Don't kill children!
[00:42:53.221 --> 00:42:55.542]  You are a accomplice to murder!
[00:42:57.048 --> 00:43:12.072]  And so if you want to kill little defenseless people and you think it's cute and funny, like Dr. Eric Pionka at UT that talks about how wonderful it is when airborne Ebola gets released to kill 90% of people, I'm telling you, Pionka, kill yourself, buddy!
[00:43:12.353 --> 00:43:13.233]  You're the big man!
[00:43:14.013 --> 00:43:19.215]  Go to a gun shop, buy a .45, stick it in your mouth, and blow your brains out the back of your head!
[00:43:19.375 --> 00:43:19.995]  But you won't!
[00:43:20.275 --> 00:43:21.916]  Because you're a cowardly ghoul!
[00:43:22.116 --> 00:43:23.016]  You're a vampire!
[00:43:23.276 --> 00:43:25.997]  You get off on thinking about people dying!
[00:43:26.297 --> 00:43:28.098]  It makes your life that much sweeter!
[00:43:28.518 --> 00:43:29.738]  You are Hellspawn!
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.940]  Now I'm telling everybody out there!
[00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:39.141]  Get your soul lined up!
[00:43:39.941 --> 00:43:41.602]  Get your head screwed on straight!
[00:43:42.779 --> 00:43:49.663]  If you have any humanity in you, you should just have absolute strength welling up in you to crush these people and the info war.
[00:43:50.724 --> 00:43:58.969]  Literally, when I think about those kids they're killing, I guarantee you, ladies and gentlemen, and any man could do this, I could take on 20 people right now because I'm in the right.
[00:44:01.274 --> 00:44:03.796]  These little chicken necks couldn't take on an old lady.
[00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:14.485]  These little wannabe, control freak, murdering supporters who support the murder of the UN, cutting off people's resources, they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:17.787]  And that's why they love death and evil, because they think it's power.
[00:44:18.048 --> 00:44:19.529]  They're like a moth to flame.
[00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:22.711]  Is that not moral?
[00:44:22.832 --> 00:44:24.293]  Is it not completely moral?
[00:44:25.899 --> 00:44:41.202]  To tell Diane Francis, the writer that says she wants the Chinese model of forced abortions and sterilization and death and pain and 50 million more Chinese men than women and record suicide by depressed women that can't have babies in China.
[00:44:41.563 --> 00:44:43.763]  Shouldn't she kill herself?
[00:44:44.603 --> 00:44:49.584]  Shouldn't she go in the garage, hook up the carbon monoxide and kill herself?
[00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:52.365]  Big, fat, liberal, fake yuppie!
[00:44:54.139 --> 00:44:55.360]  Oh no, that's scary.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.861]  That's immoral for me to say that.
[00:44:57.121 --> 00:44:59.142]  It's just good for her to talk about everybody else.
[00:45:01.443 --> 00:45:06.066]  Travis County, only county in Texas, funds abortions with taxpayer money.
[00:45:06.587 --> 00:45:07.887]  Makes you pay for it.
[00:45:10.049 --> 00:45:18.094]  They don't tell these poor ignorant women having kids that there's more people wanting to adopt children every year than there are abortions.
[00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:23.039]  They don't tell these young people when Planned Parenthood pushes it on them.
[00:45:23.259 --> 00:45:27.140]  They were founded by eugenicists Margaret Sanger and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:45:30.201 --> 00:45:37.262]  See, it's so moral when they... I mean, I've seen three articles in Newsweek every time I pick it up in the last month and a half.
[00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:38.142]  I've read it three times.
[00:45:38.943 --> 00:45:44.024]  Every time there's an article about how great people are committing suicide for the environment.
[00:45:44.964 --> 00:45:47.105]  In fact, this morning I had to run out of the house to get here.
[00:45:47.565 --> 00:45:48.725]  I saw another article
[00:45:52.788 --> 00:45:54.930]  About committing suicide for the environment.
[00:45:56.111 --> 00:45:58.013]  In fact, let's do that live on screen right now.
[00:45:59.194 --> 00:46:06.881]  Go to Google, or go to startpage.com, go to Google, type in, kill yourself for the environment.
[00:46:10.004 --> 00:46:13.748]  And there's articles about how great it is to commit suicide.
[00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:24.421]  These people are amazing.
[00:46:25.542 --> 00:46:32.244]  Now again, I don't really want the editorialist Diane Francis to commit suicide.
[00:46:32.284 --> 00:46:36.985]  She has two children, though she wants by law for you not to be able to have any, or only have one.
[00:46:37.945 --> 00:46:38.746]  Look at Ted Turner.
[00:46:38.766 --> 00:46:43.807]  He has five children, owns more houses, last time I saw in the paper, than anybody else in the country.
[00:46:46.168 --> 00:46:49.889]  Five children we know about, but he doesn't want you to be able to have any.
[00:46:50.802 --> 00:46:52.243]  These people are sick.
[00:46:52.503 --> 00:46:53.444]  Put her on screen.
[00:46:54.504 --> 00:46:56.785]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:57.826 --> 00:47:03.289]  The article is titled, Furious Reaction to Sick Editorial Calling for Global One-Child Dictatorship.
[00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:06.691]  We'll put that on screen.
[00:47:06.751 --> 00:47:11.034]  And then while I'm talking to callers today, I want you to go in and type starving children.
[00:47:11.934 --> 00:47:14.756]  And you can type vultures eating dead child.
[00:47:14.796 --> 00:47:18.218]  Here, let's show people vultures eating dead babies.
[00:47:20.626 --> 00:47:25.551]  This woman ought to be made to go to Africa and spend a month with those people dying.
[00:47:25.571 --> 00:47:29.655]  And then, oh, I love what the yuppies always say, well, those Africans should just go where the food is.
[00:47:29.695 --> 00:47:35.161]  Yeah, the globalists fund wars to push people off their land, according to State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:38.524]  Then they're pushed into desert areas and starved to death.
[00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:41.628]  And people sit around going, well, they should just move where there's food.
[00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:44.709]  They always counter back.
[00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:46.331]  Oh, you say adopt these babies.
[00:47:46.771 --> 00:47:49.554]  Let's see you adopt some black or Hispanic babies.
[00:47:49.975 --> 00:47:52.638]  Did you know there are groups fighting to adopt those children?
[00:47:54.099 --> 00:47:55.981]  There are people that adopt those children.
[00:47:58.244 --> 00:48:00.446]  There's large groups of white Christians that adopt
[00:48:01.407 --> 00:48:04.789]  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 black and hispanic babies that would have been aborted.
[00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.631]  There's programs where they pay the mothers not to abort.
[00:48:08.372 --> 00:48:13.775]  And then they fund fake liberal hispanic and black groups to come and say whites shouldn't be able to save the babies.
[00:48:14.176 --> 00:48:19.899]  Better the babies thrown in a biohazard bag and used for genetic experiments.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.203]  Better their retinas are used to grow vaccine lots.
[00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:32.143]  Better they be melted down and used for women's collagen injections.
[00:48:33.424 --> 00:48:35.346]  Because that's how you treat a black baby.
[00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.408]  We're not going to let a whitey get the kids.
[00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:39.329]  We're going to kill them.
[00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.833]  Just like Margaret Singer said, we've got to hire blacks.
[00:48:45.514 --> 00:48:50.318]  We've got to hire blacks to go out and sell the blacks on letting us kill them.
[00:48:51.906 --> 00:48:57.210]  And then when you want to murder black people, you get awards from the NAACP.
[00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:59.972]  You get Woman of the Year in Time Magazine.
[00:49:01.473 --> 00:49:07.677]  But when you want to save the black people, the ADL writes hit pieces on you, saying you're a Nazi.
[00:49:08.698 --> 00:49:10.799]  That's how this upside-down world works.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.083]  Yeah, there you found the vulture about to have its meal of the tiny child.
[00:49:21.049 --> 00:49:29.455]  Let's put some more starving children up on the video, so that when this woman watches this video, and no doubt she'll be sent it, and no doubt you will watch it!
[00:49:29.475 --> 00:49:31.756]  Oh, I know your argument.
[00:49:31.776 --> 00:49:34.778]  Well, if we get rid of masses of them, then this won't happen anymore.
[00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:38.341]  It's the overpopulation, with the weird little smiley face she has.
[00:49:39.482 --> 00:49:41.043]  And looking at her picture makes me sick.
[00:49:42.486 --> 00:49:43.727]  Power trips, which she's on.
[00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:54.872]  Did you know the Royal Commission in 49 found that the West was going to keep the third world from industrializing, even though that would make their numbers go down from on average four children to 1.3 like the West?
[00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:59.595]  And that they decided to let their numbers explode to destroy their industrial base?
[00:50:00.155 --> 00:50:10.240]  And now the UN treaty will double their taxes that are on the West, double third world taxes, massively killing people who were borderline starving to death?
[00:50:13.953 --> 00:50:17.955]  Look, I know all your excuses, all your programming, all the garbage you were taught.
[00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:24.178]  I know you go to your little Malthusian meetings, your little fake liberal meetings and talk about the people bomb all day.
[00:50:24.198 --> 00:50:26.018]  I know who you are, lady.
[00:50:26.979 --> 00:50:28.460]  I know your whole game plan.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.741]  And you feel like a little goody two-shoe there.
[00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:33.502]  Put her up on screen again.
[00:50:34.807 --> 00:50:38.989]  Furious reaction to sick editorial calling for global one-child dictatorship.
[00:50:39.229 --> 00:50:40.169]  Look at that smile!
[00:50:40.229 --> 00:50:42.851]  I've seen that smile a million times from these people.
[00:50:43.231 --> 00:50:48.273]  When you see that smile, that look, that is the spirit of these people.
[00:50:49.273 --> 00:50:50.954]  The smiley face pet demons.
[00:50:51.274 --> 00:50:52.715]  How many times have I talked about them?
[00:50:53.835 --> 00:50:55.276]  How many times have I warned you?
[00:50:55.536 --> 00:50:58.557]  That is the face of true evil incarnate.
[00:50:59.098 --> 00:51:01.719]  And it will have its way with you, whether you like it or not.
[00:51:02.381 --> 00:51:06.031]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:06.412 --> 00:51:09.420]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:09.661 --> 00:51:11.064]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:51:11.764 --> 00:51:14.427]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:51:14.447 --> 00:51:20.672]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:51:20.833 --> 00:51:25.877]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:51:25.897 --> 00:51:36.027]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:51:36.127 --> 00:51:38.228]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:51:38.469 --> 00:51:39.809]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.331]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:44.353]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:51:44.633 --> 00:51:49.396]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:58.902]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:52.112]  Season's greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:54:03.431 --> 00:54:08.154]  And I saw the man coming to take my life.
[00:54:08.174 --> 00:54:11.476]  So I did what I had to do.
[00:54:31.271 --> 00:54:32.532]  I shot the sheriff.
[00:54:32.552 --> 00:54:35.353]  Steve in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:54:35.393 --> 00:54:35.993]  Hey.
[00:54:36.033 --> 00:54:36.494]  Hey, buddy.
[00:54:58.479 --> 00:55:00.220]  Hey, I had a quick question, Alex.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:21.907]  Since we both know that the Catholic Church is deeply connected with the New World Order, and that's a real problem with me because I am a Catholic, and I was just curious if any of the other big Protestant branches like Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian are connected to the New World Order as well, because I need to find a new church, but I don't want to go to one of those yuppie feel-good churches.
[00:55:21.947 --> 00:55:23.628]  I want to go to a church that reads Scripture.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:30.603]  Well, sir, you know, I don't sit up here on the radio judging people and judging groups.
[00:55:30.663 --> 00:55:32.263]  I go off the fruits and the facts.
[00:55:32.944 --> 00:55:37.325]  And the last two pubs have called for a planetary government, a one-world religion.
[00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:41.527]  At the same time, they have spoken out against abortion and eugenics.
[00:55:43.388 --> 00:55:44.869]  All the major denominations
[00:55:45.825 --> 00:56:11.893]  have been financed and funded by the big banks now and they're all basically controlled the clergy response teams the secret fema program now declassified to recruit all the major denominations is now the public uh... and so i would uh... i don't know i was told by a bunch of people about a good baptist church in austin tim what's the name of that church you're telling me the name of a really good church that's uh... anti new world order
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.460]  Capital City Baptist.
[00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:16.141]  I mean, you're not in Austin, though, are you?
[00:56:17.141 --> 00:56:18.802]  No, but I used to live in Austin.
[00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:19.962]  It's a really great place.
[00:56:20.303 --> 00:56:25.204]  Actually, you just brought up another question, because I know Austin is not deregulated yet.
[00:56:25.224 --> 00:56:34.828]  I know the whole state of Texas is, but I think y'all still have Austin Power Company, whereas in the Houston area, we have all sorts of different electric companies.
[00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:42.931]  So deregulation is going to be pushed, and it's predicted to be one of the biggest industries in the world.
[00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:45.568]  You know, by like 2020 or something.
[00:56:45.748 --> 00:56:48.249]  Is that a New World Order agenda?
[00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:49.770]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.571]  We build the infrastructure with our tax money.
[00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:54.372]  They then give it to select groups.
[00:56:54.392 --> 00:57:02.295]  That's why Bilderberg had Rick Perry in 2007 to Bilderberg because he handed it over to a Bilderberg group member.
[00:57:02.315 --> 00:57:03.316]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:04.336 --> 00:57:08.998]  Coming up, I'm going to break down the whole eugenics announcement, the one-child announcement from Copenhagen.
[00:57:09.298 --> 00:57:10.598]  That's really the big issue here.
[00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.259]  Dave in North Carolina.
[00:57:13.299 --> 00:57:14.159]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:14.520]  Welcome.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.080]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:16.740]  Good.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.761]  I don't know how you do it without going nuts.
[00:57:21.182 --> 00:57:25.843]  Listen, I wanted to comment on Dr. Paul's Audit the Fed bill.
[00:57:27.204 --> 00:57:28.184]  It's just constant.
[00:57:28.264 --> 00:57:33.406]  It's bothered me all along why so many of the people who
[00:57:34.748 --> 00:57:47.926]  Uh, I've signed on to this bill to get it passed and I'm just, I'm all for auditing the Fed and when we find out that the Fed is a pit of vipers,
[00:57:49.144 --> 00:57:53.225]  They're going to say, oh, maybe it's time to replace the Federal Reserve.
[00:57:53.425 --> 00:57:55.505]  Well, then we cross that bridge when we come to it.
[00:57:55.565 --> 00:57:57.246]  We give the power back to Congress.
[00:57:58.466 --> 00:58:01.247]  There is no other group to replace with it that's private bankers.
[00:58:01.487 --> 00:58:02.527]  They are the globalist.
[00:58:03.067 --> 00:58:04.187]  And Ron Paul is good.
[00:58:04.287 --> 00:58:05.387]  All his fruits are good.
[00:58:05.928 --> 00:58:11.909]  And the way that the Federal Reserve has countered our movement to audit them and then abolish them with their big
[00:58:13.338 --> 00:58:22.244]  lobbyists they hired was to put that fear story out and use their operatives in the Patriot movement to try to hamstring us, but they failed.
[00:58:23.245 --> 00:58:25.666]  So this is a good thing across the board.
[00:58:25.787 --> 00:58:28.869]  The Fed has fought this tooth and nail.
[00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:34.752]  And so we're in the process of exposing the real government, the illegitimate banking structure.
[00:58:35.393 --> 00:58:37.914]  We'll come back to you, Dave, let you finish up, then others.
[00:58:37.955 --> 00:58:38.375]  Stay with us.

[00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:54.802]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.122 --> 00:58:59.164]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.444 --> 00:59:04.866]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.206 --> 00:59:05.646]  It's true.
[00:59:05.946 --> 00:59:10.488]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.808 --> 00:59:11.349]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.629 --> 00:59:14.912]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.212 --> 00:59:18.955]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.135 --> 00:59:19.676]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.936 --> 00:59:22.318]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.698 --> 00:59:26.101]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.381 --> 00:59:26.582]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.162 --> 00:59:31.084]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.304 --> 00:59:36.067]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.347 --> 00:59:40.389]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.529 --> 00:59:42.090]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:53.749 --> 00:59:55.670]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:59.013]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.377 --> 01:00:06.018]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.678 --> 01:00:07.739]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:09.560]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.201 --> 01:00:11.021]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:13.283]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:17.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.526 --> 01:00:21.589]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.772 --> 01:00:35.620]  Ron Paul talked about earlier last hour how Democrats and Republicans on the committee, the House Banking Committee, tried to strip
[01:00:36.724 --> 01:00:38.504]  The strong provisions out of the bill.
[01:00:38.524 --> 01:00:40.085]  But he was able to override that.
[01:00:40.545 --> 01:00:44.685]  His strong, clean bill is going to the House floor today.
[01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:46.506]  And he believes it will be passed.
[01:00:47.086 --> 01:00:54.327]  We're going to re-air that key five-minute discussion we had, the last five minutes of the interview, when Bob Chapman joins us next hour.
[01:00:54.687 --> 01:00:55.647]  So that is coming up.
[01:00:55.687 --> 01:00:57.708]  But yes, it's going to a full vote today.
[01:00:58.368 --> 01:01:05.209]  Going back now here in our number two that we just started on this Friday, December 11th edition, to Dave.
[01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:19.745]  Dave, what happened is they had all the usual suspects, all the usual operatives that I've identified in our movement, who do nothing but infighting and stirring up trouble and telling us we can't win and attacking anybody who's for real.
[01:01:20.585 --> 01:01:27.069]  They've all been beating the drum off the same script that, oh my gosh, this is a plan to get rid of the Federal Reserve and give us something even worse.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.100]  Okay?
[01:01:29.741 --> 01:01:33.143]  The Federal Reserve is the holding company for private banks that run the planet.
[01:01:33.463 --> 01:01:35.365]  You expose it, you expose the whole system.
[01:01:35.665 --> 01:01:41.369]  Sure, they'll try another bait-and-switch once we audit the Fed and start dismantling them, but then we've got to have that fight there.
[01:01:42.762 --> 01:01:45.023]  But no, the Fed did not want this audited.
[01:01:45.323 --> 01:01:46.984]  They've done everything they can to stop it.
[01:01:47.244 --> 01:01:48.085]  They're panicking.
[01:01:48.445 --> 01:01:55.968]  They've dispatched thousands of bureaucrats that they pay full-time to go into public schools and colleges and the city councils and try to brainwash people.
[01:01:56.408 --> 01:01:57.429]  Ron Paul's for real.
[01:01:57.849 --> 01:01:58.790]  His bill's for real.
[01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.830]  Go read the bill.
[01:02:00.971 --> 01:02:04.632]  If Ron Paul wasn't for real, he would have let it pass out of committee, stripped.
[01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:05.593]  He didn't.
[01:02:05.693 --> 01:02:06.153]  He beat it.
[01:02:07.614 --> 01:02:09.855]  He made sure it stayed strong, stayed pure.
[01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:13.317]  And so certainly they're going to try other tricks down the road.
[01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:16.037]  But we don't not go up against them because of that.
[01:02:16.077 --> 01:02:26.819]  We've gone from maybe 5% of the population a decade ago, knowing the private Federal Reserve was the real government and was illegitimate, to the polls are 75, 80, 81, 83.
[01:02:26.919 --> 01:02:30.500]  I've seen polls as high as only 17% want to keep the Fed, only 21% want to keep Bernanke.
[01:02:37.739 --> 01:02:41.421]  Americans now identify them as the threat, and rightfully so.
[01:02:41.622 --> 01:02:57.712]  So, again, more time is spent in the Patriot movement analyzing and second-guessing and making stuff up about Ron Paul, when Ron Paul is a gentleman and a statesman, and his fruits are the best out there.
[01:02:58.092 --> 01:02:59.293]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:00.774]  Not what somebody says, but what they do.
[01:03:01.718 --> 01:03:03.222]  Look at the fruits of this radio show.
[01:03:03.442 --> 01:03:04.946]  All we do is wake people up.
[01:03:05.326 --> 01:03:07.331]  All we do is fight the New World Order.
[01:03:07.692 --> 01:03:11.240]  All we... I mean, most people that even attack me admit I woke them up.
[01:03:12.418 --> 01:03:16.680]  But see, they then just spun out and got caught up in COINTELPRO and are weak-minded.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.801]  So, yes, it's a good bill.
[01:03:19.521 --> 01:03:21.062]  It's the beginning of the end of the bankers.
[01:03:21.342 --> 01:03:22.923]  We're identifying them as illegitimate.
[01:03:23.143 --> 01:03:26.844]  We're identifying them as the problem, as the inflation tax, as the global government.
[01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:27.965]  They don't like this.
[01:03:28.245 --> 01:03:32.547]  Some people are trying to spin it and say, oh, the ClimateGate emails came out for some reason.
[01:03:32.707 --> 01:03:33.087]  Why?
[01:03:33.627 --> 01:03:36.309]  No, it came out because somebody got sick of it and leaked them.
[01:03:36.529 --> 01:03:37.429]  Got sick of the lies.
[01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:38.509]  That's a great victory.
[01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.791]  The establishment does not want you to believe you can have a victory.
[01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:47.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, they don't want you to get involved and take action.
[01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.931]  They don't want you to believe you have power.
[01:03:50.011 --> 01:03:50.972]  Don't you understand that?
[01:03:52.792 --> 01:03:53.252]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:03:53.793 --> 01:03:54.233]  Slow down.
[01:03:54.253 --> 01:03:54.913]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:58.094]  I didn't mean to disagree with them, but I think it's all great.
[01:04:00.175 --> 01:04:02.536]  I really just wanted to say the same thing you just said.
[01:04:02.636 --> 01:04:13.100]  When they audit the Fed and they say it's time to do away with the Fed and we're going to do the new world currency, I'm saying we've got to be there to trip them.
[01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:15.723]  And say no, we see through that.
[01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:16.664]  Good, good.
[01:04:16.724 --> 01:04:18.044]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Dave.
[01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:21.627]  Let me just make this clear and put a bookend on this.
[01:04:22.887 --> 01:04:29.750]  The private Federal Reserve bankrupted us by design last year and has stolen $23.7 trillion as of four months ago.
[01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:31.251]  We haven't gotten new numbers since then.
[01:04:31.991 --> 01:04:32.271]  Okay?
[01:04:32.592 --> 01:04:36.473]  They are already trading SDRs, global currency, bank to bank.
[01:04:36.934 --> 01:04:38.715]  They are the ones killing the dollar.
[01:04:39.015 --> 01:04:41.076]  They are bringing in the global currency.
[01:04:41.516 --> 01:04:44.077]  People that say, oh, they want to get rid of the Fed to bring in a global currency.
[01:04:44.397 --> 01:04:47.399]  It's the Fed bringing in the global currency.
[01:04:47.899 --> 01:04:49.640]  It's the Fed killing the dollar.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.621]  It's already happening.
[01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:53.924]  It's just a cashless system.
[01:04:54.785 --> 01:04:56.568]  That's what's so frustrating about this.
[01:04:57.489 --> 01:04:58.931]  We're having victories.
[01:05:01.223 --> 01:05:03.845]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:09.208]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.568 --> 01:05:11.309]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.609 --> 01:05:16.432]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:17.573]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.793 --> 01:05:18.554]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.934 --> 01:05:20.515]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:21.636]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.937]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.097 --> 01:05:25.198]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.418 --> 01:05:26.779]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:27.159]  If there
[01:05:27.159 --> 01:05:29.321]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:05:29.481 --> 01:05:32.024]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.204 --> 01:05:35.408]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.788 --> 01:05:39.312]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.612 --> 01:05:40.613]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:41.454]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.754 --> 01:05:42.655]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:43.596]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.776 --> 01:05:44.457]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:45.078]  I think?
[01:06:00.154 --> 01:06:05.341]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:09.847]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:11.850]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:13.632]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:14.934]  There is a solution.
[01:06:15.154 --> 01:06:23.179]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:08:02.593 --> 01:08:08.616]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.236 --> 01:08:12.198]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:25.675]  Yeah, that one, I'm always looking for a place for optimism.
[01:08:25.715 --> 01:08:29.961]  I guess I'm less optimistic about anything decent coming out of the healthcare.
[01:08:30.001 --> 01:08:31.683]  I think it's going to get worse.
[01:08:32.205 --> 01:08:35.608]  We believe the people in this country accept incrementalism.
[01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.910]  Medical care is seen somewhat different.
[01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:44.536]  They don't see that the same principles of liberty apply to medical care as they do to their Second Amendment and their First Amendment rights.
[01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:47.339]  So, I mean, you think health care is going to pass as things stand right now?
[01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:48.460]  Yeah, to some degree.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:53.325]  Whether they keep all this on and they're not going to get total control, but they're going to have more control.
[01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:54.906]  The quality of health care is going
[01:08:55.206 --> 01:09:01.111]  Quarter million dollar fines, five years in prison, 41 billion dollar cut to Medicare.
[01:09:01.151 --> 01:09:02.612]  I mean, how is that liberal?
[01:09:02.713 --> 01:09:04.114]  Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[01:09:04.534 --> 01:09:15.423]  And then the other big thing that I imagine by the time the dust settles they will undermine the ability to get a medical savings account.
[01:09:15.463 --> 01:09:18.386]  Because right now, if you really want to take care of yourself,
[01:09:18.786 --> 01:09:26.824]  You can go out and get a medical savings account, pay for all your local bills and your doctor bills and put money in the savings account and get a tax benefit from this.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:39.828]  No matter what they did, if that was available to the people, where they had the chance to just walk away from the system, but this crowd up here now is not interested in protecting your right to... They want control over people, don't they?
[01:09:39.848 --> 01:09:40.669]  Yeah, it's the same way.
[01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:49.294]  You know, Medicare, even though those medical savings accounts are a good idea, if you're 65 or over and you're in Medicare, you don't have a choice of that.
[01:09:49.354 --> 01:09:53.417]  So they started by mandating everybody be in it because they need your money.
[01:09:54.037 --> 01:10:00.785]  There's going to be a lot more of that, so I can't find room for optimism about what's happening in the medical care.
[01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:10.287]  Well, that is devastating news from one of the only medical doctors in Congress and an economist award-winning, Congressman Ron Paul, telling us that it looks like it's going to pass.
[01:10:10.327 --> 01:10:16.030]  Folks, you better do whatever you can to stop this and let Harry Reid and others know they're not going to get re-elected if they do this.
[01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:18.351]  In closing, Congressman, some good news.
[01:10:18.971 --> 01:10:20.612]  You got 311 sponsors.
[01:10:20.672 --> 01:10:21.732]  It's passed out of committee.
[01:10:22.192 --> 01:10:22.893]  Audit the Fed.
[01:10:22.933 --> 01:10:23.673]  The Fed's admitted.
[01:10:23.733 --> 01:10:25.414]  You audit us, you'll destroy us.
[01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:29.355]  In the last three minutes we've got left, sir, auditing the Fed.
[01:10:29.395 --> 01:10:30.476]  Give us a report on that.
[01:10:31.249 --> 01:10:38.873]  Okay, I think most know that last week it was put into a bank regulation bill, which is a monster of a bill.
[01:10:39.393 --> 01:10:44.836]  When it came out of the committee, I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good things when there's a lot of bad things in it.
[01:10:44.876 --> 01:10:50.059]  But my amendment won by 42 to 26, which was a major victory.
[01:10:50.399 --> 01:10:52.300]  It's on the House floor at this moment.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.321]  It will be voted on at the end of the day.
[01:10:55.061 --> 01:10:59.743]  And the auditing provision is in both the Republican version and the Democratic version.
[01:10:59.783 --> 01:11:03.945]  The Democratic version will pass and the auditing provision will be in there.
[01:11:04.346 --> 01:11:06.206]  The real work needs to be done in the Senate.
[01:11:06.226 --> 01:11:13.370]  So if anybody knows where their Senator stands, try to urge the Senators to get on that same bill.
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.612]  I think it's 604 and there's 30 in over there.
[01:11:17.672 --> 01:11:23.915]  There's been several Senators that have put a hold on Bernanke's reappointment unless
[01:11:25.154 --> 01:11:30.918]  Uh, unless they, um, have a vote on, uh, 1207, the auditing bill, in the Senate.
[01:11:31.439 --> 01:11:34.180]  So, sir, this is a massive victory.
[01:11:34.341 --> 01:11:40.845]  I mean, today it looks like they're gonna probably pass it in the House, it'll go to the Senate, and then the fight's in the Senate.
[01:11:40.865 --> 01:11:42.126]  This is incredible news.
[01:11:42.861 --> 01:11:43.842]  Yeah, it's big.
[01:11:44.982 --> 01:11:47.824]  We have no idea, you know, exactly what will happen.
[01:11:47.844 --> 01:11:52.227]  There'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate, and the Fed still has time to do all that they do.
[01:11:52.727 --> 01:11:57.410]  But nevertheless, I think you're correct in describing this as a major victory for the people.
[01:11:58.651 --> 01:12:00.973]  I mean, the grassroots got this done.
[01:12:00.993 --> 01:12:02.514]  I didn't twist arms.
[01:12:02.574 --> 01:12:04.455]  I have no clout up here in that sense.
[01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:19.362]  But, we have 313 on there, all Republicans and a lot of Democrats, so it's really, it's a really great testament to what can happen when the people come together because this is not a conservative Republican bill.
[01:12:19.422 --> 01:12:29.570]  I mean, it's liberals and populists and libertarians and constitutionalists have all come around to believing enough is enough and the Fed is too big and too secret
[01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:35.453]  And we finally identified it as the real shadow government instead of Republican and Democrat puppets.
[01:12:35.473 --> 01:12:37.694]  You've been working for close to 30 years for this.
[01:12:38.075 --> 01:12:41.096]  Even if we don't have victory this year, we're a hair away.
[01:12:41.476 --> 01:12:44.698]  It'll be assured next year as the crisis accelerates.
[01:12:44.718 --> 01:12:45.359]  Do you agree with that?
[01:12:45.559 --> 01:12:48.280]  Yeah, I don't think they'll be able to ever.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.142]  If they squelch us, it'll just make it a bigger issue.
[01:12:51.662 --> 01:12:58.566]  And the problems are going to get worse and they will know where to look and they have to look to the Federal Reserve System to find a real source of our problems.
[01:12:58.854 --> 01:13:00.515]  Well, Congressman, I salute you.
[01:13:00.555 --> 01:13:04.177]  Your book is a bestseller in the Fed and bookstores and Amazon.com.
[01:13:04.677 --> 01:13:06.278]  Go to CampaignForLiberty.com.
[01:13:06.558 --> 01:13:08.959]  Go to all the great sites of Ron Paul supporting.
[01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.500]  Thank him for running for president a few years ago.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:15.622]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[01:13:15.702 --> 01:13:17.643]  It is Friday, the 11th day of December 2009.
[01:13:17.703 --> 01:13:20.044]  We are now 14 minutes into the second hour.
[01:13:24.489 --> 01:13:31.073]  And I just wanted to play that clip from part of our live interview with Congressman Ron Paul last hour.
[01:13:31.794 --> 01:13:36.497]  So they attempted to poison the bill, to strip the strong provisions out of it.
[01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:40.059]  Ron Paul beat that two weeks ago in the Banking Committee.
[01:13:40.599 --> 01:13:45.523]  He was able to make sure the strong bill is going to the floor of the House.
[01:13:46.283 --> 01:13:51.608]  To assuredly, he believes, pass today and then go to the Senate.
[01:13:51.648 --> 01:13:54.331]  This is a giant victory for everyone.
[01:13:54.371 --> 01:13:57.173]  What I'm going to do is, I'm going to continue with your calls.
[01:13:57.273 --> 01:14:02.798]  Bern in Canada, Ron in Texas, John in Texas, John in Wisconsin, Bob in Ohio, and others.
[01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:04.000]  And at the bottom of the hour,
[01:14:05.356 --> 01:14:15.959]  I'm going to do an overview of ClimateGate, the Copenhagen global government establishment meeting that is happening, and a lot more, and really boil down the master plan of these people.
[01:14:16.359 --> 01:14:21.921]  The official UN delegation, headed up by the communist Chinese, has called for a planetary dictatorship.
[01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:25.162]  This is out of the China Daily, the official government newspaper.
[01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:32.284]  They have called for an official planetary dictatorship to carry out one-child policies in every country of the planet.
[01:14:32.944 --> 01:14:34.605]  And that's only part of this plan.
[01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:37.947]  We'll be breaking it down coming up in 15 minutes.
[01:14:38.367 --> 01:14:40.328]  Right now, let's go to Byrne in Canada.
[01:14:40.368 --> 01:14:41.269]  Byrne, you're on the air.
[01:14:42.369 --> 01:14:42.830]  Hey, Alex.
[01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:43.670]  How's it going, man?
[01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:46.372]  Ah, it's the best of times and the worst of times.
[01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:48.293]  Well, it's getting better, big guy.
[01:14:48.633 --> 01:14:55.697]  Hey, what we need, man, we need a global citizen's arrest list so the people can get them.
[01:14:56.878 --> 01:14:59.719]  When it comes time, we need to know who they are.
[01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:02.241]  You know, we gotta root them out.
[01:15:02.757 --> 01:15:03.217]  One day.
[01:15:03.377 --> 01:15:05.478]  And if they take the internet away, we're screwed.
[01:15:06.838 --> 01:15:08.479]  So we need to know who they are.
[01:15:08.499 --> 01:15:10.199]  Simplify things for the people.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:22.303]  Well, we need to have, you know, Bush and Obama get in trouble for secret CIA hit teams killing people outside the legislative process and outside of the judicial process.
[01:15:23.563 --> 01:15:28.525]  I don't think we should start making lists, but we should publicly state
[01:15:29.864 --> 01:15:35.666]  That the billions of deaths, conservatively a billion, that will happen in the decade after the climate tax is put in...
[01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.307]  Fifteen plus million starve to death a year.
[01:15:39.927 --> 01:15:40.607]  Just the U.N.
[01:15:40.687 --> 01:15:43.908]  ethanol scam killed an additional 10 million last year.
[01:15:44.328 --> 01:15:48.929]  This is genocide, as Lord Monckton said yesterday here on the radio show.
[01:15:49.509 --> 01:15:54.070]  And so we do need to point out that these are eugenicist terrorists.
[01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:55.531]  And people don't know what eugenicists are.
[01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.211]  We'll be breaking that down later.
[01:15:57.531 --> 01:15:58.932]  But I appreciate your call, Berne.
[01:16:01.192 --> 01:16:03.194]  I mean obviously everyone knows who the globalists are.
[01:16:03.234 --> 01:16:20.992]  David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, the Queen of England, the people pushing for world government, Prince Philip calling for exterminating 80% of the world's population, Dr. Eric Pionka at the University of Texas calling for airborne Ebola to be released to kill 90% of the world's population and how great it's going to be.
[01:16:21.913 --> 01:16:23.294]  We know who these individuals are.
[01:16:23.314 --> 01:16:27.818]  White House science czar calling for drugging the water supply to sterilize the population.
[01:16:28.399 --> 01:16:30.360]  We know who these people are.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:48.115]  We need to identify them as criminals and then as they implement their carbon tax, if we can't stop it, they're already implementing it in the third world and many first world nations, as that bankrupts people, as that causes people to starve, as that causes poverty, we need to have grand juries indict them for murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
[01:16:48.908 --> 01:16:53.889]  Because they say they want to reduce world population, and that's why they're, quote, destroying our industrial society.
[01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.850]  So, we need to continue the education process.
[01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:58.730]  Ron in Texas.
[01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:59.691]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:01.111]  Thank you, sir.
[01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:06.672]  I just want to say it's a great honor to share carbon monoxide in a chair with you and a fellow brother that feels the same way.
[01:17:06.692 --> 01:17:07.753]  Carbon dioxide.
[01:17:08.053 --> 01:17:11.293]  Carbon dioxide's the good guess, yeah, that they want to tax.
[01:17:11.974 --> 01:17:17.775]  I just want to say that it's a sad thing, and I want to go back to something that Ted Nugent said about the apathy.
[01:17:18.724 --> 01:17:25.567]  And quote somebody said something once, history is a cycle and we're doomed to repeat it if we don't learn from it.
[01:17:26.788 --> 01:17:32.871]  And I've elaborated a little bit more, if you don't experience it yourself, as a people, you're even more doomed.
[01:17:32.911 --> 01:17:33.791]  As a Native American,
[01:17:34.514 --> 01:17:38.295]  A lot of the things that happened to us are happening again on a broader scale.
[01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:41.655]  But because it's not... That's actually the official UN model.
[01:17:41.715 --> 01:17:44.396]  Hitler built it off what happened to Native Americans here.
[01:17:44.716 --> 01:17:49.057]  Shut off your resources, put you on reservations, and then slowly exterminate you.
[01:17:49.557 --> 01:17:50.137]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:50.497 --> 01:17:54.657]  And because most of the people have never experienced it, it's not going on to them.
[01:17:54.717 --> 01:17:55.438]  They don't see it.
[01:17:56.478 --> 01:18:03.219]  And you don't have to look at the third world, because they don't say, they say, it's not going on in my yard, so I don't care.
[01:18:04.034 --> 01:18:06.114]  Look back at the history of what's going on here.
[01:18:06.434 --> 01:18:10.015]  You have people living in third world conditions now that are starving.
[01:18:10.255 --> 01:18:14.056]  You have people that are suffering from disease now that are dying.
[01:18:14.696 --> 01:18:18.297]  All because of New World Order, which started for my people in 1492.
[01:18:19.357 --> 01:18:27.378]  And if they wake up, read people like Angie Debow, and see what's going on, maybe we'll start getting more people woken up.
[01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:31.339]  But, until then, you can see I'm real strong about this.
[01:18:32.006 --> 01:18:35.088]  I've been awake since I was 7 years old fighting this.
[01:18:35.769 --> 01:18:39.872]  And it's just an honor to talk with you about it and I don't want to take up any more of your time, but thank you.
[01:18:40.392 --> 01:18:41.993]  God bless you sir, good to hear from you.
[01:18:42.534 --> 01:18:43.915]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[01:18:43.935 --> 01:18:44.695]  John, go ahead.
[01:18:44.715 --> 01:18:46.256]  Hey Alex.
[01:18:46.777 --> 01:18:46.877]  Hey.
[01:18:46.897 --> 01:18:53.842]  When I was growing up in the 50's, nobody that I knew of, including our family, had health insurance.
[01:18:54.417 --> 01:18:57.800]  But when you went to the doctor, you went to the hospital, you didn't get bankrupted either.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:07.647]  It was easy to, you know... The government bureaucracy and welfare is what screwed up our system, and now the government's answer is ten times more government.
[01:19:08.588 --> 01:19:14.873]  And notice Obama's health care plan strips $41 billion out of Medicare, over $30 billion out of Medicaid a year.
[01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:19.717]  So they're taking your health care, you fools out there that like big government.
[01:19:21.175 --> 01:19:26.998]  Because the doctors had fair rates back then, it was easy to pay off, and nobody lacked for health care.
[01:19:27.118 --> 01:19:32.401]  All of a sudden now, if you go to the hospital, you're bankrupted, and so you gotta have this socialized medicine.
[01:19:32.461 --> 01:19:33.882]  It's just, you know, disgusting.
[01:19:34.463 --> 01:19:35.263]  That's the plan!
[01:19:35.343 --> 01:19:39.465]  Make you dependent on government so they can forcibly sterilize you.
[01:19:39.746 --> 01:19:41.807]  That's in the official government announcements.
[01:19:42.964 --> 01:19:47.189]  People have trouble dealing with this because it's so horrifying, but it's real.
[01:19:47.589 --> 01:19:48.530]  The facts are in.
[01:19:48.570 --> 01:19:50.232]  More phone calls straight ahead.
[01:19:50.272 --> 01:19:51.253]  Thanks, John, for the call.
[01:19:52.875 --> 01:20:00.183]  We'll take another call from John in Wisconsin and Bob, Tom, and others, and then I'm going to break down the latest developments from Copenhagen.
[01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:09.650]  We're good.
[01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.709]  We're good to go.
[01:20:44.648 --> 01:20:44.849]  We're good.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.723]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes.
[01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:07.566]  The makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:21:07.686 --> 01:21:10.268]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.529 --> 01:21:13.811]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle.
[01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:14.992]  Quality above all else.
[01:21:15.172 --> 01:21:19.576]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:21:19.676 --> 01:21:21.558]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:21:21.678 --> 01:21:22.179]  We're good to go.
[01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:41.535]  You bet!
[01:22:01.522 --> 01:22:02.363]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.563 --> 01:22:07.889]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:08.510]  I get it.
[01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:17.980]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.261 --> 01:22:19.422]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.662 --> 01:22:27.906]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.126 --> 01:22:31.388]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.528 --> 01:22:35.590]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:37.350]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:40.612]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:40.792 --> 01:22:44.954]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.154 --> 01:22:45.875]  You should, too.
[01:22:46.055 --> 01:22:47.036]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:50.118]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:50.138 --> 01:22:50.178]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:50.238]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.258 --> 01:22:50.619]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.953 --> 01:23:09.379]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:15.344]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:23:15.664 --> 01:23:22.189]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:23:22.754 --> 01:23:26.037]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:23:26.157 --> 01:23:28.399]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:23:28.599 --> 01:23:34.965]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:23:35.206 --> 01:23:38.529]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[01:23:38.729 --> 01:23:42.592]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[01:23:45.755 --> 01:23:48.736]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:50.996]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[01:23:51.116 --> 01:23:54.497]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[01:23:54.777 --> 01:23:55.937]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.492]  Monday through Friday.
[01:24:36.764 --> 01:24:37.625]  From 11 a.m.
[01:24:37.665 --> 01:24:38.305]  to 3 p.m.
[01:24:38.325 --> 01:24:40.566]  Central, we're here live.
[01:24:40.606 --> 01:24:42.427]  I come back Sundays live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:24:42.447 --> 01:24:43.828]  with an abbreviated transmission.
[01:24:44.128 --> 01:24:46.149]  Got a special show lined up for you this Sunday.
[01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:47.970]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:24:52.673 --> 01:24:54.854]  The people are rising up against the globalists.
[01:24:55.294 --> 01:24:56.815]  The world government has been announced.
[01:24:57.335 --> 01:24:58.816]  The people are fighting back.
[01:24:59.837 --> 01:25:01.798]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:25:01.838 --> 01:25:03.839]  Let's talk to John in Wisconsin.
[01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:04.800]  John, you're on the air.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.220]  Go ahead.
[01:25:06.636 --> 01:25:09.978]  Well, I wanted to thank you for taking my call, and thank you for your good work.
[01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:11.178]  Thanks for calling.
[01:25:11.198 --> 01:25:11.799]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:12.559 --> 01:25:19.622]  Well, first off, if you ever need any work with FOIA stuff, I'm real good at that, as your Governor Perry found out with his emails.
[01:25:20.563 --> 01:25:32.749]  But the main thing I wanted to alert you to is that the Appleton, Wisconsin Planned Parenthood, a group called Live Action, has videotaped them giving just patently absurd and false medical information.
[01:25:33.473 --> 01:25:44.740]  Well they also, the Planned Parenthood also advertises you can give money just to kill black babies, and in 2008, we haven't gotten the numbers for 2009, there were more black babies aborted than were born.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.863]  Yeah, and this videotape makes it very clear that their main money maker is abortions.
[01:25:50.943 --> 01:25:55.366]  I mean, this guy's giving this woman a hard sell that makes a used car salesman look like a piker.
[01:25:56.587 --> 01:25:58.568]  And so it's a group called Live Action.
[01:25:58.668 --> 01:26:00.269]  They have a really nice video out there.
[01:26:00.942 --> 01:26:06.106]  So I thought you might want to add that to your, you know, Planned Parenthood is a genocidal eugenics operation.
[01:26:06.647 --> 01:26:11.130]  Well, I mean, they're admittedly founded by the Rockefellers and Margaret Sanger for that reason.
[01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:13.272]  I mean, Hitler thanked Margaret Sanger.
[01:26:13.833 --> 01:26:16.895]  But again, the real Nazis pose as liberals.
[01:26:17.556 --> 01:26:18.597]  That's the big issue here.
[01:26:19.657 --> 01:26:20.178]  Good points.
[01:26:20.238 --> 01:26:20.979]  Anything else, John?
[01:26:21.679 --> 01:26:24.421]  I don't, like I said, in that regard, you're kind of preaching to the choir.
[01:26:25.402 --> 01:26:27.184]  Yeah, but we have a... Thank you, John.
[01:26:27.424 --> 01:26:28.425]  Just remember, we have
[01:26:29.991 --> 01:26:31.792]  We're on all these AM and FM stations.
[01:26:31.832 --> 01:26:34.174]  The Friday show gets re-aired on XM on the weekend.
[01:26:34.975 --> 01:26:36.836]  We're on shortwave, satellite, internet.
[01:26:37.616 --> 01:26:43.601]  We have new listeners every second tuning in, so I don't exactly just preach to the choir here on this show.
[01:26:44.501 --> 01:26:46.583]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:26:46.603 --> 01:26:48.244]  Let's talk to Bob in Ohio.
[01:26:48.624 --> 01:26:49.525]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:26:49.565 --> 01:26:50.005]  Go ahead.
[01:26:50.646 --> 01:26:52.887]  Hey, God bless you, Alex, and all your staff.
[01:26:52.967 --> 01:26:56.350]  Hey, two-tour Vietnam vet born-again Christian.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.580]  And I'm fed up.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:04.364]  I want to address the Senate and the Congress and the globalists and the high school kids and the college people out there.
[01:27:04.805 --> 01:27:17.952]  If you think I took thousands and thousands of American boys over to a crap war over in Vietnam and then watch them disregard border sovereignty of other countries and put us under the United Nations,
[01:27:18.524 --> 01:27:22.845]  If you think you guys are going to take it over, you're wrong.
[01:27:22.885 --> 01:27:28.586]  We're not going to go out, like Independence Day said, we will not go quietly into the night.
[01:27:29.026 --> 01:27:30.926]  We will not go without a fight.
[01:27:31.086 --> 01:27:46.529]  So I want you young people in college to get unbrainwashed, you people to get off your backsides and quit watching football games and take this country back and demand that we have some sovereignty and stay out of other countries taking over the world.
[01:27:47.193 --> 01:27:48.754]  Okay, you people gotta wake up.
[01:27:49.094 --> 01:27:51.115]  Jones, Alex, I love you dearly.
[01:27:51.155 --> 01:27:56.497]  You're a son of liberty, and so am I, and we're gathering more people.
[01:27:57.137 --> 01:28:03.480]  I just, all these thousands and millions of people dying around the world for one world order, okay?
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.102]  Al Gore, and I want to address John Boceri here in Ohio.
[01:28:08.503 --> 01:28:13.785]  You know, you voted for a national energy tax.
[01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:25.654]  So if the big globalists think they're going to tax us into oblivion and put us under slavery by taxes, you're not going to do it, John Boccieri.
[01:28:26.174 --> 01:28:26.554]  Okay?
[01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:27.675]  And thank you, Alex.
[01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:28.515]  God bless you.
[01:28:29.615 --> 01:28:30.215]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:30.275 --> 01:28:31.235]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:31.255 --> 01:28:32.596]  Let's jam in one more.
[01:28:32.696 --> 01:28:34.456]  Let's talk to Tom in Colorado.
[01:28:34.496 --> 01:28:35.416]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:28:37.237 --> 01:28:37.397]  Hey.
[01:28:38.197 --> 01:28:38.537]  Hey, buddy.
[01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:39.557]  Hey.
[01:28:39.577 --> 01:28:43.838]  Alright, so I was listening to all about the Copenhagen and everything, all about that
[01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:46.962]  And, man, I cannot stand the Lord.
[01:28:47.502 --> 01:28:51.387]  What really got me about it was Fox News sends out these text messages.
[01:28:51.427 --> 01:28:52.348]  My girlfriend gets one.
[01:28:52.368 --> 01:28:55.671]  She reads it and says, wow, this is bad.
[01:28:55.731 --> 01:28:57.914]  They're not going to allow Christmas trees at the thing.
[01:28:58.757 --> 01:29:01.318]  Yes, they say Christmas trees are hateful.
[01:29:02.058 --> 01:29:07.539]  The globalists know how to set the precedent that they say what you can have as decorations.
[01:29:07.579 --> 01:29:14.401]  They say what type of toilet you can have, what type of air conditioner, what type of house, what type of light bulb, how much meat you can eat.
[01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:22.863]  I have video clips today from the British government saying we're not going to even let you have meat, much less put taxes on it.
[01:29:23.243 --> 01:29:26.864]  They are just total control freaks taking everything over
[01:29:27.324 --> 01:29:29.086]  I'm gonna break that down on the other side.
[01:29:29.106 --> 01:29:29.606]  Anything else?
[01:29:30.747 --> 01:29:31.528]  That don't work for me.
[01:29:31.608 --> 01:29:32.348]  I'm a vegetarian.
[01:29:33.449 --> 01:29:35.111]  All right, buddy.
[01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:37.633]  The point is that they can control one group, they can control everybody.
[01:29:37.653 --> 01:29:46.081]  I'm gonna come back, break down exactly what's happening, exactly who we're facing, and what we need to do to stop them on the other side of this quick break.
[01:29:46.201 --> 01:29:49.624]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are our websites.
[01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:52.266]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.746 --> 01:29:54.248]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.243 --> 01:29:58.045]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.387 --> 01:30:04.629]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:09.012]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.272 --> 01:30:14.696]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.036 --> 01:30:15.477]  It's true.
[01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:20.320]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.180]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.461 --> 01:30:24.743]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.043 --> 01:30:28.786]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.966 --> 01:30:29.506]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.767 --> 01:30:32.128]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:35.911]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:36.731]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.992 --> 01:30:40.914]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.134 --> 01:30:45.898]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.178 --> 01:30:50.219]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.339 --> 01:30:51.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:01.943 --> 01:32:05.544]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.884 --> 01:32:14.005]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.745 --> 01:32:18.786]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.386 --> 01:32:30.188]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.828 --> 01:32:39.831]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:45.413]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.773 --> 01:32:52.956]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.256 --> 01:32:55.997]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:08.032]  We are back live.
[01:33:08.112 --> 01:33:15.475]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday, the 11th day of December, 2009 edition.
[01:33:16.035 --> 01:33:17.415]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:17.435 --> 01:33:23.097]  I'm going to break down the overall Globalist Master Plan from their own words, their own statements.
[01:33:23.897 --> 01:33:26.978]  For the New World Order, global government is only the beginning.
[01:33:29.093 --> 01:33:31.535]  That's what the back of my film, Endgame, says.
[01:33:31.975 --> 01:33:33.536]  They want you dead!
[01:33:34.297 --> 01:33:36.779]  For the New World Order, a world government is just the beginning.
[01:33:37.299 --> 01:33:50.469]  Once in place, they can engage their plan to exterminate, this is official UN government plan, 80% of the world's population while enabling the elites to take advantage of the life-extension technologies and the resources for themselves.
[01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:58.416]  For the first time, crusading filmmaker Alex Jones, that's me, reveals their secret plan for humanity's extermination, Operation Endgame.
[01:33:59.176 --> 01:34:10.166]  Jones chronicles the history of the global elite's bloody rise to power and reveals how they have funded dictators and financed the bloodiest wars, creating order out of chaos to pave the way for the first true world empire.
[01:34:10.746 --> 01:34:21.555]  Watch as Jones and his team track the elusive Bilderberg Group to Ottawa and Istanbul to document their secret summits, allowing you to witness global kingpins setting the world's agenda for instigating World War III.
[01:34:22.316 --> 01:34:27.018]  Learn about the formation of the North American Transportation Control Grid, which will end U.S.
[01:34:27.038 --> 01:34:27.798]  sovereignty forever.
[01:34:28.218 --> 01:34:35.761]  Discover how the practitioners of the pseudoscience eugenics have taken control of governments worldwide as a means to carry out depopulation.
[01:34:36.221 --> 01:34:40.923]  View the progress of the coming collapse of the United States and the formation of the North American Union.
[01:34:41.423 --> 01:34:45.726]  Never before has a documentary assembled all the pieces of the globalist dark agenda.
[01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:56.152]  Endgame's compelling look at past atrocities committed by those attempting to steer the future delivers information that the controlling media has meticulously censored for the last 60 years.
[01:34:56.652 --> 01:35:02.655]  It fully reveals the elite's program to dominate the earth and carry out the most wicked plan in all of human history.
[01:35:03.556 --> 01:35:05.237]  Endgame is not conspiracy theory.
[01:35:05.637 --> 01:35:08.659]  It is documented fact in the elite's own words.
[01:35:10.106 --> 01:35:12.487]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, that is endgame.
[01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:13.787]  Endgame.
[01:35:15.008 --> 01:35:17.949]  Blueprint for global enslavement out for three years.
[01:35:20.650 --> 01:35:24.472]  Here is my latest film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:35:24.492 --> 01:35:27.273]  Let me read the back of this before I get into all this information.
[01:35:27.873 --> 01:35:33.215]  Because you need to know these films are available for you to fully detail this and have the facts.
[01:35:33.315 --> 01:35:35.296]  Both films, Fall of the Republic,
[01:35:36.076 --> 01:35:45.424]  Endgame have FallTheRepublic.com, WhatIsTheEndgame.com or EndgameTheMovie.com have full bibliographies like a book.
[01:35:45.945 --> 01:35:50.909]  Online, every article, every video clip, every quote, where it was said, who said it, how they said it.
[01:35:51.710 --> 01:36:00.838]  These are documents that are put together in a riveting and revealing and terrifying fashion because the information is terrifying.
[01:36:02.276 --> 01:36:03.457]  America's last stand.
[01:36:03.637 --> 01:36:05.818]  Make the choice liberty or tyranny.
[01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:10.900]  Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.861]  economy by design.
[01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:17.864]  Leaders are now declaring that one world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[01:36:18.224 --> 01:36:21.325]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[01:36:21.365 --> 01:36:21.966]  Constitution.
[01:36:23.089 --> 01:36:27.151]  By seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[01:36:27.191 --> 01:36:28.471]  President to chair the world body.
[01:36:28.951 --> 01:36:34.994]  A scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion, and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[01:36:35.354 --> 01:36:39.056]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[01:36:39.576 --> 01:36:51.321]  A worldwide regime controlled by the unelected corporate elite is implementing a plan to set up a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[01:36:52.591 --> 01:36:55.773]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[01:36:55.813 --> 01:37:02.696]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[01:37:03.457 --> 01:37:08.499]  This film reveals the architecture of the new world order and what the power elite have in store for humanity.
[01:37:08.539 --> 01:37:15.523]  More importantly, it communicates how we the people can retake control of our government, turn the criminal tide, and bring the tyrants to justice.
[01:37:16.303 --> 01:37:19.406]  This is Fall of the Republic.
[01:37:19.907 --> 01:37:23.130]  Both DVDs available at InfoWars.com.

[01:38:02.934 --> 01:38:06.856]  It's almost half off at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:38:08.696 --> 01:38:10.177]  That's what the discount comes up to.
[01:38:10.197 --> 01:38:13.839]  You can watch the live radio show that we simulcast in living color video.
[01:38:14.079 --> 01:38:16.940]  Not just webcams, high-quality TV studio video clips.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:28.505]  You get to see the articles, the documents, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book in e-book format, thousands of pieces of media, special reports just to PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, like my Dave Mustaine interview last week.
[01:38:28.965 --> 01:38:30.369]  David Icke, the list goes on and on.
[01:38:30.449 --> 01:38:33.095]  PrisonPlanet.tv, take advantage of that.
[01:38:34.122 --> 01:38:41.745]  And also, six computers can simultaneously log on with your passcode and username that you create in about 60 seconds on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:42.325 --> 01:38:50.209]  So you can also give yourself a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and give the username and passcode as an e-card to several of your friends and family.
[01:38:50.829 --> 01:38:57.792]  Just tell them they can't share it, or then if six computers are on simultaneously, it will lock you down until somebody logs off.
[01:38:58.392 --> 01:39:01.733]  I wish I could give it to everybody free, it's just we have to fund our operation.
[01:39:01.873 --> 01:39:02.834]  But, never fear!
[01:39:04.451 --> 01:39:06.693]  Though it hurts us financially, that isn't what matters.
[01:39:07.273 --> 01:39:09.335]  All my films are free on YouTube and Google.
[01:39:09.555 --> 01:39:10.496]  Google Endgame.
[01:39:11.037 --> 01:39:11.877]  Search the term.
[01:39:11.977 --> 01:39:12.898]  Follow the Republic.
[01:39:13.319 --> 01:39:15.300]  You can watch them in decent quality online.
[01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:17.202]  It's not pearls before swine.
[01:39:17.542 --> 01:39:18.623]  I know you care about that.
[01:39:18.663 --> 01:39:19.304]  You will use it.
[01:39:19.324 --> 01:39:20.325]  You will show it to others.
[01:39:20.585 --> 01:39:21.886]  You will give it to your email list.
[01:39:21.906 --> 01:39:22.767]  You will spread the word.
[01:39:23.287 --> 01:39:29.032]  All that matters to me here is getting this information out and the people are now ready to hear the truth.
[01:39:29.332 --> 01:39:31.975]  So that's my Christmas present of liberty and the truth to everybody.
[01:39:32.555 --> 01:39:33.956]  All the films are free online.
[01:39:33.976 --> 01:39:39.381]  You should get them in better quality and support us when you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member or buy the DVD.
[01:39:39.401 --> 01:39:41.262]  And I want to thank everybody for their support.
[01:39:41.302 --> 01:39:44.024]  We couldn't do what we're doing here without you, so thank you so much.
[01:39:44.125 --> 01:39:46.206]  And to the crew that also makes it all possible.
[01:39:46.607 --> 01:39:46.887]  Okay.
[01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:54.033]  Let me, just in layman's terms, give you a basic overview.
[01:39:54.073 --> 01:39:59.137]  Then I want to go through mainstream news in your face, backing all of this up.
[01:40:03.206 --> 01:40:19.394]  About 150 years ago in England, the Royal Family publicly funded Galton, Darwin, the Huxleys, the Wedgwoods and others, the top scientific inventors, the top scientific brains in England.
[01:40:19.994 --> 01:40:25.417]  Pioneering eugenics, anthropology, sociology, the list goes on and on.
[01:40:28.649 --> 01:40:32.832]  They went to him and they said, people are rebelling against the empire worldwide.
[01:40:33.272 --> 01:40:39.096]  How do we set up a scientific dictatorship where the people love their own servitude?
[01:40:39.396 --> 01:40:40.517]  We have all these white papers.
[01:40:40.817 --> 01:40:41.737]  We cover them in Endgame.
[01:40:43.338 --> 01:40:44.539]  This is mainline history.
[01:40:44.579 --> 01:40:45.540]  This is on the record.
[01:40:48.202 --> 01:40:54.326]  And they came back and they said, we have to create social departments.
[01:40:54.586 --> 01:40:55.566]  Planned Parenthood.
[01:40:55.606 --> 01:40:56.287]  We have to create
[01:40:57.745 --> 01:41:01.629]  Health departments that will carry out racial hygiene.
[01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.833]  And we will start taking poor people's children.
[01:41:06.893 --> 01:41:08.535]  We will start sterilizing them.
[01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:14.340]  We can start drugging the water supply to make people passive and to go along with our orders.
[01:41:16.242 --> 01:41:19.565]  We can put in puppet governments in the third world that we control.
[01:41:19.926 --> 01:41:21.167]  Take down the British flag.
[01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:45.133]  But have covert operations that work through puppet governments and through roundtable groups, so they set up the Royal Commissions, who then set up the Royal Institute on International Affairs, who set up the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, and other management groups that actually control the industry, banking, media, academia.
[01:41:47.287 --> 01:41:53.973]  And most of the people in those groups aren't aware of the full scope of the operational system.
[01:41:56.275 --> 01:41:58.137]  So you have higher level groups that control that.
[01:41:59.598 --> 01:42:08.446]  And they called for, through banking and through fiat currency, going in and buying off third world and first world nations leaders.
[01:42:09.844 --> 01:42:12.666]  And to get those countries in debt as long as they pay it off the leadership.
[01:42:13.186 --> 01:42:19.590]  If the countries wouldn't go along with it, they would finance revolutions within or finance their neighbors to attack them.
[01:42:20.631 --> 01:42:21.971]  This is all declassified.
[01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:26.654]  The Milner papers from Lord Milner in 1914, the list goes on and on.
[01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:30.877]  They said we will institute World War I and World War II.
[01:42:30.957 --> 01:42:32.218]  This is over a hundred years ago.
[01:42:33.306 --> 01:42:43.330]  As a pretext to make the public say we don't want any more war, we want a global private corporate government through the League of Nations and the United Nations to end all war.
[01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:53.114]  But in truth they actually hand out the weapon systems and the technological systems so that actually more wars get started and that of course has come out in the public record.
[01:42:55.295 --> 01:42:57.896]  By the sixties they came up with the environmental plan
[01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:08.185]  To carry out eugenics and to tell the public the world was overpopulated and that resources had to be cut off to the planet to save the planet.
[01:43:08.625 --> 01:43:19.770]  And Maury Strong at the UN, David Rockefeller and others wrote books and gave statements and gave speeches at the UN and the UN wrote up battle plans to forcibly reduce world population.
[01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:27.882]  By cutting off the resources and going in and paying off the government's leaders to engage in forced sterilization.
[01:43:27.902 --> 01:43:30.006]  500,000 plus women were sterilized.
[01:43:30.588 --> 01:43:32.912]  34 states passed laws for forced sterilization.
[01:43:34.721 --> 01:43:38.923]  That really happened environmentally by the turn of the last century, but they relaunched it in the 60s.
[01:43:39.683 --> 01:43:46.926]  Hitler embarrassed them by having a brand of eugenics that was a little fast-moving for them and also only targeted certain groups.
[01:43:47.466 --> 01:43:50.447]  So they then began to call themselves environmentalists, transhumanists.
[01:43:50.787 --> 01:43:55.469]  The eugenics quarterly changed its name to an environmental study group.
[01:43:55.809 --> 01:43:57.510]  They became crypto-eugenicists.
[01:43:59.505 --> 01:44:08.909]  And they have stated that they would fearmonger the planet in the name of an ice age, in the name of global heating, global warming, acid rain, to accept this.
[01:44:09.749 --> 01:44:21.854]  And that once the private central banks had gotten the nations in enough debt, they would bankrupt them by design, use global deals with China, who was their partner in 1975, via treaty that George Bush Sr.
[01:44:22.134 --> 01:44:24.235]  got them to sign when he was ambassador to China.
[01:44:24.915 --> 01:44:30.077]  to have a one-child policy where the babies are taken and in many cases killed.
[01:44:30.137 --> 01:44:30.897]  That's on record.
[01:44:31.337 --> 01:44:32.737]  Forced abortions are performed.
[01:44:33.398 --> 01:44:38.299]  And China was told all major industrial facilities will be moved to China.
[01:44:38.759 --> 01:44:43.601]  We will set up cartels and monopolies where all other industry is bankrupted.
[01:44:43.981 --> 01:44:53.003]  A select group of banks financing this will own the sub-corporations and the Chinese government will then be set up as the new world superpower by 2010.
[01:44:54.764 --> 01:44:57.085]  We're now 2010 in just a few weeks.
[01:44:57.705 --> 01:44:59.807]  And they've announced they are the new superpower.
[01:45:00.147 --> 01:45:01.307]  They are the controlling arm.
[01:45:02.988 --> 01:45:06.050]  China would then own the majority of British, European and U.S.
[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:08.871]  debt and would be able to order things through the U.N.
[01:45:09.912 --> 01:45:11.312]  That's now been announced yesterday.
[01:45:13.914 --> 01:45:17.015]  The economy would be completely bankrupted in phases.
[01:45:18.116 --> 01:45:22.698]  If you are too poor, CPS will visit your home and will take your children.
[01:45:23.934 --> 01:45:25.316]  School will be year-round.
[01:45:25.396 --> 01:45:34.608]  That's all in government textbooks like Ecoscience, written by Paul Ehrlich, chief advisor to George Bush Sr., and to Barack Obama, John P. Holdren, current White House science czar.
[01:45:37.844 --> 01:45:50.508]  They will then set up a global carbon tax with a ID card issued nationally, but globally standardized under a treaty signed with the UN in 2000, where everything you eat, everywhere you go, everything you do will be tracked.
[01:45:50.868 --> 01:45:57.070]  License plate reading cameras already going on in England, Europe, and the US will tax you by the mile, track everywhere you go.
[01:45:57.371 --> 01:45:59.751]  When your carbon credits run out, you're already taxed.
[01:45:59.791 --> 01:46:03.793]  The taxes will go way up to as much as $10 per mile driven.
[01:46:04.193 --> 01:46:06.994]  There will be taxes on all beef, all chicken, all fish.
[01:46:07.634 --> 01:46:11.580]  That will be added by a global regulatory body run by the IMF and World Bank.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.346]  That is now in the Danish text of the Copenhagen Global Government Treaty.
[01:46:17.528 --> 01:46:20.813]  Herman Van Rompuy, the new head of the EU, openly states this.
[01:46:20.953 --> 01:46:22.195]  Al Gore openly states this.
[01:46:22.595 --> 01:46:23.436]  It's all happening.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:29.984]  Everything will systematically and incrementally, so you can't stand up against it as easily.
[01:46:30.004 --> 01:46:31.465]  If it happens overnight, you'd stand up.
[01:46:31.905 --> 01:46:33.887]  Be implemented year-round school.
[01:46:34.567 --> 01:46:36.689]  You'll have to stay at school until 8, 9 at night.
[01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:43.214]  Everyone will get monthly CPS, health department, eugenics visits to your home.
[01:46:45.516 --> 01:46:49.780]  This is so unbelievably horrible, ladies and gentlemen, that I shake when I talk about
[01:46:52.182 --> 01:46:53.763]  I literally woke up at 4 a.m.
[01:46:53.803 --> 01:46:57.585]  again this morning completely freaked out over this because it's all been announced.
[01:46:58.065 --> 01:47:01.827]  It's one thing to read State Department Memorandum 200 where Henry Kissinger stated this in 1973.
[01:47:02.587 --> 01:47:08.490]  It's one thing to read the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96 calling for exterminating 80% of the population.
[01:47:09.111 --> 01:47:10.951]  It's one thing to know all this was coming.
[01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:12.812]  It's another thing to now see it happening.
[01:47:13.113 --> 01:47:19.336]  I want to play Herman Von Rompuy, the new head of the EU, saying global governance, the first year of global governance is 2009.
[01:47:19.436 --> 01:47:19.656]  Here it is.
[01:47:23.512 --> 01:47:30.273]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[01:47:31.274 --> 01:47:37.695]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[01:47:38.935 --> 01:47:39.255]  Okay.
[01:47:39.895 --> 01:47:42.796]  The global management of our planet through global government, global governance.
[01:47:43.076 --> 01:47:49.057]  Here is Al Gore saying the same thing.
[01:47:50.573 --> 01:48:08.488]  It is the awareness itself that will drive the change, and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements, but the many business leaders who have been present here... That's right, and that's the next key.
[01:48:09.605 --> 01:48:16.630]  The Fortune 100, Dutch Royal Shell, Exxon Mobil, it's now come out in the climate game, emails, are running at all.
[01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:22.694]  While saying, oh you're with the oil companies, the oil companies are owned by the big banks and insurance companies, they own this.
[01:48:22.754 --> 01:48:34.583]  Now, in Fall of the Republic, that's been out for almost two months, before climate game, we have their statements and their documents, where the IMF and World Bank
[01:48:35.882 --> 01:48:39.464]  We'll run the planetary government and you will pay your carbon taxes to them.
[01:48:40.665 --> 01:48:42.386]  The treaty was meant to be secret.
[01:48:42.466 --> 01:48:48.850]  The new global government treaty was meant to be secret until next week during the two-week Copenhagen global government conference.
[01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:52.132]  But it was leaked three days ago to the London Guardian.
[01:48:52.453 --> 01:48:53.994]  The UN confirms it is the treaty.
[01:48:54.374 --> 01:48:55.895]  It says the UN is only a front.
[01:48:56.255 --> 01:48:59.137]  The IMF and World Bank will now set up planetary government.
[01:49:00.114 --> 01:49:07.928]  Through the G20, there will be a global authority over all travel, 2% flat tax over every nation paid to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:49:09.368 --> 01:49:16.032]  30% tax on all fossil fuels, natural gas, taxes on all meat, television sets, light bulbs, water.
[01:49:16.532 --> 01:49:20.334]  There are over 150 taxes, 700 new bureaucracies.
[01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:26.277]  Obama has said, this was in AP two days ago, headline, Obama threatens command and control.
[01:49:26.997 --> 01:49:31.259]  And he says even if Congress, the Senate won't ratify this, he's going to sign it.
[01:49:31.619 --> 01:49:34.661]  He can't sign it and do it if they won't ratify it.
[01:49:34.681 --> 01:49:37.883]  But he says, I am a dictator, I'm going to do this.
[01:49:38.823 --> 01:49:47.266]  And he's illegally getting $500,000 cash payment from the Nobel Laureate Committee and being given this warmongering peace prize.
[01:49:49.226 --> 01:50:05.752]  So we're going into global government and our Senate's being told, we don't care if you're not going to ratify the treaty, we're going to do it through the bureaucracy unless carbon dioxide is a toxic waste that humans exhale and plants live off of, that plants respirate, that they breathe through photosynthesis.
[01:50:07.418 --> 01:50:09.098]  This is all human activity.
[01:50:09.619 --> 01:50:14.800]  Copenhagen Climate Summit, on top of that, they've sold the third world that you're going to get to loot America.
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:20.141]  You're going to get all these taxes from the same IMF and World Bank that have always been raping the third world.
[01:50:20.481 --> 01:50:24.802]  Through 30% loan sharking rates, where a $1 million loan to Nigeria turns into $45, $55, $65 billion now.
[01:50:27.395 --> 01:50:34.359]  It states in here, double the energy cuts for Africa, Latin America, and undeveloped Asia, or developing Asia.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:36.661]  15 million starve to death a year.
[01:50:36.901 --> 01:50:41.184]  The UN ethanol scam caused an additional 10 million deaths last year.
[01:50:41.524 --> 01:50:42.284]  That's official.
[01:50:42.685 --> 01:50:44.966]  This is meant for population reduction.
[01:50:45.246 --> 01:50:47.368]  And I'll go over the proof of that next.
[01:50:47.488 --> 01:50:55.012]  A private, global, corporate government that wants to exterminate you and your family from their own quotes and their own words.
[01:50:56.033 --> 01:50:58.497]  For the New World Order, world government is just the beginning.
[01:50:58.798 --> 01:51:00.841]  We're going to tell you what their regime will look like.
[01:51:01.302 --> 01:51:02.784]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:03.345 --> 01:51:05.849]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[01:51:06.069 --> 01:51:08.293]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.

[01:51:15.004 --> 01:51:15.584]  Here's why.
[01:51:15.724 --> 01:51:23.486]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[01:51:23.926 --> 01:51:27.427]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:51:27.967 --> 01:51:33.409]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:51:33.869 --> 01:51:34.729]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:35.299 --> 01:51:37.840]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[01:53:42.734 --> 01:53:44.195]  So, there's no longer any denial.
[01:54:07.651 --> 01:54:13.757]  A private corporate government made up of the same banks that have imploded the world's economy by design.
[01:54:14.197 --> 01:54:19.783]  McClatchy Newspapers has written a five-part series on the Goldman Sachs documents coming out, how this was all rigged.
[01:54:20.183 --> 01:54:22.445]  The banks have been given unlimited power to steal money.
[01:54:22.946 --> 01:54:30.853]  That's now in the Times of London today, that the UN's adding on a new tax with this plan for global banking bailouts.
[01:54:32.311 --> 01:54:35.273]  The UN will no longer have any power over this.
[01:54:35.333 --> 01:54:44.517]  It will be the IMF and World Bank that are the new global government who can quote, this is London Guardian, secretly raise any taxes they want.
[01:54:44.857 --> 01:54:49.019]  And under treaty, our government signs on illegally to do whatever they say.
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:54.042]  And then our Senate says we're not going to do it, and Obama says I'll implement it anyways then.
[01:54:55.097 --> 01:55:02.189]  High treason, totally illegal, absolutely impeachable offense, as Ron Paul said with us in the first hour today.
[01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:07.419]  Now, here is China Daily, the big government newspaper in China.
[01:55:08.547 --> 01:55:10.809]  Population control called key to deal.
[01:55:11.229 --> 01:55:16.353]  Population and climate change are intertwined, but the population issue has remained a blind spot.
[01:55:16.833 --> 01:55:20.075]  Yes, climate change, we have normal climate change, but now they say it's abnormal.
[01:55:20.115 --> 01:55:24.559]  First it was global warming, first global freezing, then global warming, now just any change is not normal.
[01:55:25.279 --> 01:55:27.000]  Discuss ways to mitigate climate change.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:41.087]  Dealing with climate change is not simply an issue of CO2 emissions reduction, but a comprehensive challenge to involving political, economic, social, cultural, and economic issues, and the population concern fits right into the picture, said Zhao, who's a member of the Chinese government delegation.
[01:55:41.827 --> 01:55:49.191]  And it goes on to call for a planetary regime to reduce humans, and China then went on to say we want a global one-child policy.
[01:55:50.154 --> 01:55:54.934]  Now, what was in the National Post, one of the biggest papers in Canada yesterday?
[01:55:56.035 --> 01:56:05.922]  We have the communist Chinese that own most our debt saying we'll sign on to this if you set up a world one-child policy and they're talking about getting rid of the tax credits in the U.S.
[01:56:05.942 --> 01:56:08.364]  for having children and then putting a tax on you.
[01:56:08.665 --> 01:56:11.707]  That's how the Chinese one-child policy started in 75.
[01:56:12.027 --> 01:56:13.328]  By 1980 it was law.
[01:56:13.588 --> 01:56:15.990]  They have forced abortions, forced infanticide.
[01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:19.413]  They take the children, kill them, use them for medical experiments.
[01:56:19.533 --> 01:56:20.934]  That's mainstream news.
[01:56:22.509 --> 01:56:27.531]  The real inconvenient truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[01:56:29.672 --> 01:56:37.115]  The inconvenient truth overhanging the UN's Copenhagen Conference is not that climate is warming or cooling, but that humans are overpopulating the world.
[01:56:37.475 --> 01:56:42.957]  A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birth rate.
[01:56:44.458 --> 01:56:46.739]  And they go on to say that we have to get rid of humans.
[01:56:47.321 --> 01:56:50.744]  Now, what does EcoScience, written by the White House Science Czar, say?
[01:56:51.024 --> 01:56:51.544]  Same thing.
[01:56:51.925 --> 01:56:54.046]  What does Dr. Eric Bianca, UT, say?
[01:56:54.307 --> 01:57:01.252]  A global police state government, that's a quote, to carry out the orderly extermination of 90% of the world's population.
[01:57:01.272 --> 01:57:02.113]  They debate.
[01:57:02.713 --> 01:57:02.113]  80, 90, 95.
[01:57:04.014 --> 01:57:05.475]  Ted Turner says 95.
[01:57:05.736 --> 01:57:06.496]  Prince Philip says 80%.
[01:57:07.737 --> 01:57:09.899]  This is what the big banks want.
[01:57:11.277 --> 01:57:24.862]  They want to get rid of people, and they talk about how they're drugging the water supply, and want to drug the water supply to sterilize you, and the sperm counts down over 85% in every nation that adds chemicals to the water, not just fluoride.
[01:57:26.665 --> 01:57:28.107]  I indict the globalists.
[01:57:28.267 --> 01:57:29.448]  I indict the UN.
[01:57:29.989 --> 01:57:33.333]  These are not environmentalist well-meaning wackos that are just wrong.
[01:57:33.753 --> 01:57:42.482]  These are lying people that want to hijack the whole economy, have global taxes to the criminal private banks run by people like Ken Lay and Madoff, same crew.
[01:57:42.502 --> 01:57:46.287]  Ken Lay came up with a carbon tax plan with Al Gore.
[01:57:47.572 --> 01:57:49.454]  I indict you for genocide.
[01:57:49.534 --> 01:57:55.161]  Just your ethanol plan killed an additional 10 million people on top of the normal 15 million from starvation.
[01:57:55.942 --> 01:57:59.446]  Under the Copenhagen Global Treaty, double or right at double.
[01:58:00.768 --> 01:58:01.429]  Right at double.
[01:58:01.449 --> 01:58:02.370]  It's a little under double.
[01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:06.154]  The cuts have to be made by the developing and third world that the West has to make.
[01:58:06.454 --> 01:58:07.255]  The taxes.
[01:58:08.427 --> 01:58:12.108]  This will kill a billion people if implemented in the first decade.
[01:58:12.408 --> 01:58:13.628]  Those are conservative numbers.
[01:58:13.668 --> 01:58:15.009]  The magnitude of this.
[01:58:15.369 --> 01:58:16.449]  This is eugenics.
[01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:17.949]  This is starvation.
[01:58:18.210 --> 01:58:19.430]  This is mass murder.
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:20.570]  This is death.
[01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:21.790]  This is real.
[01:58:22.051 --> 01:58:23.711]  This has always been their plan.
[01:58:24.111 --> 01:58:25.771]  I have thousands of their documents.
[01:58:25.892 --> 01:58:27.052]  Hundreds of their textbooks.
[01:58:27.252 --> 01:58:28.332]  All the UN documents.
[01:58:28.572 --> 01:58:29.893]  The State Department documents.
[01:58:30.113 --> 01:58:31.493]  The Club of Rome documents.
[01:58:31.813 --> 01:58:37.481]  A total Chinese-style police state murdering your children, forced abortions.
[01:58:37.802 --> 01:58:38.463]  It's real!
[01:58:38.663 --> 01:58:39.704]  You better wake up!
[01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:44.751]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.252 --> 01:58:48.457]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.778 --> 01:58:55.420]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:58.802]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.042 --> 01:59:03.825]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:03.845 --> 01:59:10.088]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.228 --> 01:59:12.470]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.290]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.730]  Bernanke?
[01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:14.591]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.631 --> 01:59:15.771]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:18.012]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:31.917 --> 01:59:33.738]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.038 --> 01:59:38.922]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.202 --> 01:59:49.128]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.571 --> 01:59:55.473]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.953 --> 01:59:58.715]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.367 --> 02:00:09.469]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.190 --> 02:00:10.990]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:12.711]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.731 --> 02:00:16.973]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.513 --> 02:00:21.596]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.276 --> 02:00:26.738]  Bob Chapman on the economy and the Copenhagen situation coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:26.798 --> 02:00:28.319]  We'll also go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:33.214 --> 02:00:40.952]  So, in the last 25 minutes, I've been covering the New World Order Master Plan, what their plan was, what they've currently set up, the open takeover...
[02:00:42.099 --> 02:00:54.293]  There's a headline in the Times of London, the end of freedom on the ocean, UN control over the ocean treaty, international small arms ban that Obama says he's going to sign superseding the second amendment.
[02:00:54.373 --> 02:00:55.194]  That's happening.
[02:00:56.395 --> 02:01:03.363]  Congress says they won't pass the UN treaty, they won't ratify it, so Obama says he's just going to implement it by fiat, high treason.
[02:01:05.495 --> 02:01:29.486]  And the stated goal of the carbon taxes by the UN, and the taxes on all human activity, enlisting carbon dioxide that humans exhale as a toxic waste, is to starve people to death in the third world, shut off industry and business so bad in the United States and Europe and Japan, that everyone or almost everyone becomes bankrupt, government-run healthcare to control your life, to then carry out eugenics,
[02:01:30.086 --> 02:01:40.498]  Euthanasia, forced abortion, the case for killing granny, the cover of Newsweek telling you how great suicide is and other articles teaching children they're bad and that suicide is good.
[02:01:40.739 --> 02:01:41.640]  That's ABC News.
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:42.320]  People won't believe me.
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:43.322]  Pull up ABC News.
[02:01:43.702 --> 02:01:44.843]  Teaching children when to die.
[02:01:45.745 --> 02:01:46.646]  Want them to see that headline.
[02:01:47.226 --> 02:01:51.350]  Along with the cartoons they show them of animals being killed and say, so you need to kill yourself.
[02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:54.873]  This is so diabolical, so cult-like, so evil.
[02:01:55.553 --> 02:01:57.995]  Training humans to turn off their survival instinct.
[02:01:58.296 --> 02:02:03.260]  To turn their survival instinct into something of species survival, which is false, to kill ourselves.
[02:02:04.601 --> 02:02:11.307]  We have to indict the people publicly for the sickening, Malthusian, Hitlerian scum they are.
[02:02:12.729 --> 02:02:17.789]  Openly telling us, planetary government, to carry out one-child policies.
[02:02:19.142 --> 02:02:24.023]  Once you're bankrupted in the West, they will then come, do an assessment, and take your children from you.
[02:02:24.324 --> 02:02:25.524]  This is what they've stated.
[02:02:25.804 --> 02:02:27.484]  They're now announcing it.
[02:02:27.905 --> 02:02:29.785]  22,000 homes in England now, children at birth.
[02:02:30.105 --> 02:02:36.167]  The parents have to put cameras in their homes, guilty until proven innocent for six months, to prove they're not abusive.
[02:02:36.667 --> 02:02:38.107]  The child falls down once.
[02:02:38.528 --> 02:02:39.508]  You don't feed them right.
[02:02:39.568 --> 02:02:40.528]  They take your children.
[02:02:40.968 --> 02:02:42.109]  Cameras in homes. 1984.
[02:02:45.219 --> 02:02:46.920]  They are drugging the water supply.
[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:48.660]  That's come out and been declassified.
[02:02:49.321 --> 02:02:50.781]  It's not just sewer runoff.
[02:02:50.921 --> 02:02:56.724]  In cities like Dallas and others, they've done studies where the Prozac is hundreds of times higher than it could be from runoff.
[02:02:57.044 --> 02:02:57.844]  It's being added.
[02:02:58.224 --> 02:02:59.925]  Meanwhile, the British, U.S.
[02:02:59.985 --> 02:03:06.188]  and Japanese governments, you can pull up MSNBC this year, proposed putting statined anti-
[02:03:07.629 --> 02:03:14.855]  Cholesterol drugs in the water, when they cause all those liver problems, forced medication, and Prozac-type drugs in the water.
[02:03:14.875 --> 02:03:19.198]  Well, they're already doing it, as they call for an eco-science to make you docile.
[02:03:19.879 --> 02:03:31.169]  Out of thousands of plastic combinations, 50 years ago, globally, a type of plastic was adopted that leaches powerful estrogen mimickers that sterilize men and make women
[02:03:31.849 --> 02:03:34.051]  Hyper-hormonal and give them breast cancer.
[02:03:34.351 --> 02:03:39.654]  By design, the UN's been caught adding female hormones to tetanus shots that then sterilize women.
[02:03:39.875 --> 02:03:40.895]  That's mainstream news.
[02:03:41.215 --> 02:03:53.584]  This year, AP reported the UN got caught in Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, giving people live, weaponized polio, killing them en masse.
[02:03:53.664 --> 02:03:54.685]  Associated Press.
[02:03:57.318 --> 02:04:00.781]  Chicago Tribunes, Chicago Water in public report.
[02:04:00.841 --> 02:04:04.624]  City silent over sex hormones and painkillers found in treated drinking water.
[02:04:05.765 --> 02:04:06.606]  It's being added.
[02:04:07.767 --> 02:04:10.469]  In streams and rivers that have no human runoff into them.
[02:04:10.809 --> 02:04:13.492]  The plants, the animals are becoming sterilized.
[02:04:13.552 --> 02:04:15.974]  The frogs, the fish, the salamanders.
[02:04:16.014 --> 02:04:16.834]  It's being added.
[02:04:17.295 --> 02:04:19.617]  They've caught water supplies going to humans.
[02:04:20.731 --> 02:04:24.296]  That have no runoff from sewage, so could not have these drugs.
[02:04:24.616 --> 02:04:27.220]  They found it hundreds of times the level it should be.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.082]  You are being drugged!
[02:04:29.523 --> 02:04:31.446]  That's why you feel like garbage.
[02:04:31.666 --> 02:04:33.288]  That's why you can't get your energy up.
[02:04:33.508 --> 02:04:35.751]  That's why you can't get angry at the New World Order.
[02:04:35.992 --> 02:04:37.414]  That's why you've lost your vision.
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:40.341]  You're living inside the New World Order.
[02:04:40.701 --> 02:04:48.605]  When we come back with Bob Chapman, I'm going to tell you what they're going to do if they win, and how they're going to carry out the extermination in a very brief synopsis.
[02:04:48.985 --> 02:04:52.046]  We have all the evidence from their own statements how they're doing it.
[02:04:52.346 --> 02:04:54.107]  How have I known all this was going to come?
[02:04:54.747 --> 02:04:57.409]  How did I know they'd announce global government at this Copenhagen summit?
[02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:59.750]  Because they said they would 20 years ago!
[02:05:01.138 --> 02:05:03.740]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:09.123]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.483 --> 02:05:11.205]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.525 --> 02:05:16.348]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.528 --> 02:05:17.489]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.709 --> 02:05:18.449]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:20.431]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.731 --> 02:05:21.551]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.791 --> 02:05:23.853]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:23.993 --> 02:05:25.114]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.334 --> 02:05:26.655]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.295 --> 02:05:29.236]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[02:05:29.396 --> 02:05:31.916]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.116 --> 02:05:35.297]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.697 --> 02:05:39.198]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.519 --> 02:05:40.499]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.739 --> 02:05:41.359]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.639 --> 02:05:42.559]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.759 --> 02:05:43.500]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:44.380]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:47.545]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:08:01.594 --> 02:08:03.776]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.336 --> 02:08:07.218]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.061 --> 02:08:13.282]  We are back live.
[02:08:13.302 --> 02:08:18.225]  I'm going to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster to get his take on the Global Government Eugenics Program.
[02:08:19.046 --> 02:08:20.327]  There is no longer any doubt.
[02:08:20.547 --> 02:08:26.531]  The public in the past wouldn't go read UN documents, State Department documents, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:08:27.981 --> 02:08:48.392]  He's stating they would set up a planetary regime run by private banks, they would tax everything as a form of neo-feudalistic serfdom, shut off your energy, your power, take your children from you, drug your water supply, dumb you down, put cancer viruses in vaccines to kill you, soft kill weapons that take decades to activate, implanting your DNA with the viral RNA.
[02:08:49.977 --> 02:08:52.418]  This has all been done by design.
[02:08:52.518 --> 02:09:09.782]  I know it's monstrous, I know it's hard to believe, but if we don't stop them, and if we don't publicly stand up and say, you are a group of murdering killers calling for global Chinese one-child policy, forced abortions, police state, if we don't get aggressive with these people, they're going to come in and push their agenda.
[02:09:12.122 --> 02:09:20.349]  National Post, one of the biggest papers in Canada, that wrote the headline, The Real Inconvenient Truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[02:09:20.729 --> 02:09:26.894]  A global government planetary law, such as China's one-child policy, is the only way to save the planet.
[02:09:27.475 --> 02:09:28.616]  That's what this is really about.
[02:09:29.477 --> 02:09:37.443]  When real world population is going to plane off, the UN admits, at eight and a half billion or less, the West is having a replacement rate of 1.3 children.
[02:09:37.724 --> 02:09:39.405]  For every two adults, they're only having 1.3 children.
[02:09:41.775 --> 02:09:42.756]  It's all a fraud.
[02:09:42.916 --> 02:09:56.373]  If they would just have industrialized the third world, which the Kyoto and Copenhagen agreements are meant to stop, they admit it's meant to freeze their industrial capacity, they have to make double the cuts we do based on the fraud that carbon dioxide is deadly poison.
[02:09:57.830 --> 02:10:02.594]  If we would have allowed them to industrialize, their numbers would have dropped, even if you believe the world's overpopulated.
[02:10:02.915 --> 02:10:04.576]  That's what's so cold-blooded about this.
[02:10:04.977 --> 02:10:09.501]  They keep the people bomb going to hurt these countries because they never get industrialized.
[02:10:10.041 --> 02:10:13.525]  They keep them from industrializing and then say, oh, now we just got to sterilize them.
[02:10:13.825 --> 02:10:16.487]  So keep them from industrializing and then sterilize them.
[02:10:17.228 --> 02:10:21.572]  The West is only having 1.3 children from Japan to the United States.
[02:10:21.832 --> 02:10:25.355]  1.3 children for every 2 indigenous adults that live there.
[02:10:26.035 --> 02:10:26.596]  The U.S.
[02:10:26.616 --> 02:10:31.980]  has grown in population because of massive, over 3 million illegals, a million illegals a year coming in.
[02:10:32.701 --> 02:10:37.365]  That's what's replacing our dying numbers, the death of the West, that Pat Buchanan has written so much about.
[02:10:38.513 --> 02:10:39.714]  This is the reality.
[02:10:40.514 --> 02:10:45.977]  And they are going to stage terror attacks to set up a bigger police state, so you can't politically change what they're doing.
[02:10:46.677 --> 02:10:53.761]  They are going to release more and more controlled biological plagues, then put soft-kill viruses, RNA, in your vaccines.
[02:10:54.401 --> 02:11:01.985]  They are just going to continue taking your children from you, bankrupting you through taxes, government-run healthcare to make you dependent on them.
[02:11:03.223 --> 02:11:10.208]  And they are just going to phase this in over the next 25 years, they have stated, until the world population starts imploding.
[02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:23.618]  And the elites say they're doing this in public writings so they can have control of the future, so they can have control of resources for themselves and their families, and so they can have the life extension technologies for themselves.
[02:11:23.939 --> 02:11:28.062]  They do not want to give those life extension technologies to the general public.
[02:11:29.161 --> 02:11:36.386]  You can't give people systems that allow them to live to 150 or older and by then even past that because of the way technology will grow.
[02:11:36.406 --> 02:11:37.407]  This is what
[02:11:38.672 --> 02:11:39.793]  Ray Kurzweil is saying.
[02:11:40.253 --> 02:11:42.954]  This is what all the top futurists at the UN are saying.
[02:11:42.974 --> 02:11:44.335]  This is what the Pentagon says.
[02:11:44.595 --> 02:11:49.757]  This is what Bill Joy, co-owner of Sun Microsystems, has written about in Wired Magazine.
[02:11:50.538 --> 02:12:00.302]  Intellectuals are all aware of this, but the average, well-educated intellectual is told, oh, you're elite, you're smart, you'll be part of this, get on board with the program.
[02:12:00.622 --> 02:12:01.723]  They think they're part of it.
[02:12:02.523 --> 02:12:04.545]  Even low-level professors are part of this.
[02:12:04.905 --> 02:12:08.047]  Newspaper writers everywhere calling for one-child policies.
[02:12:08.307 --> 02:12:11.409]  I'm sure you've seen it on the news, to lower the carbon footprint.
[02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:26.380]  This is a revolution, what they call the final revolution of a scientific dictatorship, where a rebellion of the people will be as unthinkable as a rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton or baby sheep.
[02:12:27.201 --> 02:12:28.542]  That's a quote from Bertrand Russell.
[02:12:31.451 --> 02:12:36.893]  Aldous Huxley said, whose brother ran the UN eugenics program, Secretary General of UNESCO, Julian Huxley.
[02:12:37.233 --> 02:12:48.118]  Aldous Huxley said, the scientific dictatorship will make you love your servitude, love having your bills going up, love having your children taken, love dying of cancer from the inoculations.
[02:12:48.438 --> 02:12:56.101]  The government's declassified that they put cancer viruses in over 200 million dosages of the polio vaccine that killed millions.
[02:12:57.486 --> 02:12:59.467]  This is on record, Associated Press.
[02:12:59.507 --> 02:13:10.050]  In fact, for everybody watching on TV and radio, Google Associated Press, source, AP, polio vaccine killed.
[02:13:10.130 --> 02:13:11.671]  Polio vaccine live.
[02:13:12.071 --> 02:13:14.392]  And you'll see AP this year like it's no big deal.
[02:13:14.752 --> 02:13:19.874]  Oh, all over the world, the UN gave people live weaponized polio in vaccines and it killed them.
[02:13:20.414 --> 02:13:21.294]  Oh, it was a mistake.
[02:13:21.334 --> 02:13:23.275]  No, they've been doing that for 40 years that we know of.
[02:13:25.151 --> 02:13:27.492]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so diabolical.
[02:13:27.653 --> 02:13:32.455]  Why does a young 15-year-old girl get in the car with Ted Bundy at the mall?
[02:13:32.896 --> 02:13:33.656]  He's wearing a suit.
[02:13:33.956 --> 02:13:34.557]  He's handsome.
[02:13:34.837 --> 02:13:35.597]  He's well-spoken.
[02:13:35.637 --> 02:13:36.698]  Hey, honey, let's go have fun.
[02:13:36.718 --> 02:13:39.260]  Let me go buy you a hamburger and we can have some fun in the back.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:40.680]  She's 15.
[02:13:41.001 --> 02:13:42.622]  She's getting all sexually charged up.
[02:13:43.476 --> 02:13:45.296]  You know, the guys her age aren't hitting on her.
[02:13:45.336 --> 02:13:46.437]  She wants to have some fun.
[02:13:46.697 --> 02:13:48.037]  She wants to get back at her parents.
[02:13:48.337 --> 02:13:54.838]  She can't believe that in 30 minutes she's going to be tied up in a shack with him torturing her and biting chunks out of her.
[02:13:55.778 --> 02:13:58.859]  You are the same way, America, and the rest of the world.
[02:13:59.239 --> 02:14:02.079]  You have been taught that globalism is cute.
[02:14:02.879 --> 02:14:03.739]  Print that article for me.
[02:14:03.759 --> 02:14:04.180]  They found it.
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:05.400]  CBS News is just one of them.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:09.020]  Mutant poliovirus spreads in Nigeria.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.221]  The next line they admit like it's no big deal.
[02:14:11.401 --> 02:14:12.641]  Oh, it was spreads of the vaccine.
[02:14:15.222 --> 02:14:18.263]  You better wake up and figure out there's nothing trendy about this.
[02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:22.184]  When the Fortune 100 is behind global taxes, you better run for the hills.
[02:14:22.704 --> 02:14:25.385]  When the eugenics elite is for this, you better wake up.
[02:14:25.765 --> 02:14:27.606]  All right, Bob Chapman with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:14:27.986 --> 02:14:30.487]  Bob, thanks for holding while I finished up that key breakdown.
[02:14:31.107 --> 02:14:43.891]  Speak in detail from your 45 years of fighting the globalists, formerly Army Intelligence, one of the biggest silver and gold brokers in history, private brokers, the number one newsletter until you retired, you've now come back to fight these people.
[02:14:44.591 --> 02:14:47.453]  From your study of the New World Order, is what I said accurate?
[02:14:47.693 --> 02:14:53.538]  And why do you think they're coming out and announcing one-child policy, global dictatorship, forced abortion in the U.S.
[02:14:53.578 --> 02:14:57.340]  and Canada and Europe, CPS taking almost all the children?
[02:14:57.620 --> 02:14:59.302]  It's all being announced, sir.
[02:14:59.562 --> 02:15:02.884]  No longer in the documents, now publicly.
[02:15:03.044 --> 02:15:03.645]  Bob Chapman.
[02:15:05.137 --> 02:15:14.923]  Well, that's exactly the way it is, and as an evolutionary process, I and a handful of others have been talking about it for 50 years, and it's here and now.
[02:15:15.543 --> 02:15:22.387]  I could have not said it any more fully or any better than what you have.
[02:15:23.728 --> 02:15:34.214]  I heard you yesterday, or earlier in today, I think it was earlier today, and one of the things that you touched on, that you didn't touch on this morning,
[02:15:35.097 --> 02:15:45.282]  Was the taxing attempt of formulating a new currency to be based on carbon taxes.
[02:15:46.402 --> 02:15:52.925]  And this is strongly one of the ways that they want to entrap people.
[02:15:53.906 --> 02:15:58.688]  The taxation and a new world currency based upon carbon.
[02:16:00.083 --> 02:16:05.685]  And I think we may have stopped them.
[02:16:06.385 --> 02:16:16.088]  We won't know for a few months yet, but you've been very close to, closer than I, to what's happening in Copenhagen.
[02:16:17.009 --> 02:16:29.513]  And they are conducting themselves at the meeting like nobody ever heard about ClimateGate and the release of the emails
[02:16:30.208 --> 02:16:30.428]  That
[02:16:52.159 --> 02:16:59.885]  The House and the Senate and essentially setting himself up as a dictator and committing high treason.
[02:17:00.926 --> 02:17:02.687]  That's their attitude in this thing.
[02:17:02.727 --> 02:17:04.268]  They think they can get away with anything.
[02:17:05.049 --> 02:17:12.114]  And one of the things that they've missed, I think, is they think they control the military and they don't.
[02:17:13.115 --> 02:17:17.659]  And I think they're going to find that they're going to push a little bit too far along the way here.
[02:17:17.699 --> 02:17:19.180]  And that's going to be in the next year or two.
[02:17:20.053 --> 02:17:21.935]  And everything is going to break loose.
[02:17:23.816 --> 02:17:33.003]  Well the key is, when you got government documents 45 years ago, I got government documents 14 years ago, we didn't just sit here and shut up because the media called us kooks.
[02:17:33.283 --> 02:17:36.326]  We would hold up the official IMF, World Bank, UN plans.
[02:17:36.766 --> 02:17:39.968]  So we've warned, you've probably done 10, 20, 30,000 interviews, what do you do, 5, 6, 7 a day for
[02:17:42.451 --> 02:17:57.294]  30 40 years I mean I've been reaching hundreds of millions of people over the years my films alone seen over 100 plus million times on YouTube and Google that's publicly the newspapers report that with horror that were so effective so we warned everybody
[02:17:57.574 --> 02:18:01.116]  Now everything we said would happen, happened exactly as we said.
[02:18:01.577 --> 02:18:04.258]  Not because we have crystal balls, we were reading their own documents.
[02:18:04.639 --> 02:18:07.280]  Now people are freaking out and listening.
[02:18:07.881 --> 02:18:10.322]  And so we're beginning to get the momentum.
[02:18:10.382 --> 02:18:13.164]  Ron Paul said his audit the Fed's gonna pass the House today.
[02:18:13.684 --> 02:18:19.128]  I mean, we are devastating them thanks to the fact that we didn't care about being demonized or laughed at, Bob.
[02:18:19.969 --> 02:18:20.590]  That's right.
[02:18:20.770 --> 02:18:23.473]  And we're going to keep right on doing it and sticking it to them.
[02:18:23.874 --> 02:18:24.735]  And we're going to win.
[02:18:24.755 --> 02:18:27.338]  But we've got to have the help of the public.
[02:18:27.358 --> 02:18:28.540]  They've got to get with us.
[02:18:29.457 --> 02:18:45.853]  They have to take the information that we have and go to their elected representatives, especially at the lower levels and the city councils and county councils and mayors and aldermen and state representatives.
[02:18:46.694 --> 02:18:47.795]  Go to sovereignty.
[02:18:48.135 --> 02:18:49.076]  Push the government.
[02:18:49.436 --> 02:18:50.618]  Push them right to the edge.
[02:18:50.738 --> 02:18:52.900]  Push Wall Street right to the edge.
[02:18:55.322 --> 02:18:57.683]  We have to continue to identify the enemy.
[02:18:57.703 --> 02:19:10.009]  I mean, how bold is it, how incredible is it for you to see them openly come out and admit global government, openly come out and say, world government, planetary, one-child tax,
[02:19:10.649 --> 02:19:29.172]  Take your children by law, openly being announced by the Chinese delegation, they own our debt, to see them openly announcing a global control over all transportation, a UN authority, a 2% tax on all GDP of countries, hundreds of taxes on all human activity, 700 plus new UN bureaucracies.
[02:19:29.252 --> 02:19:30.513]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:19:31.973 --> 02:19:36.354]  It certainly is, and they're going for it because they don't have any other choice.
[02:19:38.004 --> 02:19:45.566]  They took the program forward, they made a big mistake, they couldn't stop, and they can't stop anymore now than they could then.
[02:19:46.226 --> 02:19:48.547]  And if they don't go forward, they're going to be gobbled up anyway.
[02:19:51.427 --> 02:19:53.808]  Very well said, Bob Chapman.
[02:19:53.848 --> 02:19:57.289]  Let's continue to break this down on the other side of this quick break.
[02:19:57.329 --> 02:19:59.449]  This is the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[02:19:59.729 --> 02:20:00.509]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:00.529 --> 02:20:03.270]  Your calls for... You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:20:03.370 --> 02:20:05.090]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:07.011]  No more mortgage can change your life.
[02:20:07.551 --> 02:20:09.152]  With no more mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:20:09.192 --> 02:20:10.613]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:20:23.759 --> 02:20:24.979]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:20:25.039 --> 02:20:27.480]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:31.181]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:20:31.441 --> 02:20:33.541]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.

[02:20:52.567 --> 02:20:53.408]  Call the number.
[02:20:53.468 --> 02:20:54.469]  Call now for your free CD.
[02:20:54.489 --> 02:20:54.749]  800-578-6279 800-578-6279
[02:21:01.098 --> 02:21:08.580]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:14.622]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:14.922 --> 02:21:17.623]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:21:17.903 --> 02:21:23.785]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:21:24.165 --> 02:21:25.586]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:21:25.746 --> 02:21:28.027]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:28.227 --> 02:21:33.609]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:21:33.849 --> 02:21:35.690]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:37.330]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:37.690 --> 02:21:39.931]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:40.211 --> 02:21:44.573]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:44.933 --> 02:21:48.315]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:21:48.655 --> 02:21:50.796]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:51.777 --> 02:21:53.183]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:53.665 --> 02:21:54.327]  One last time.
[02:21:54.709 --> 02:21:56.054]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:22:00.728 --> 02:22:01.708]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:01.788 --> 02:22:06.571]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:22:06.731 --> 02:22:14.534]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:22:14.794 --> 02:22:20.177]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:22:20.377 --> 02:22:27.360]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:32.984]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:22:33.244 --> 02:22:37.988]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:22:38.328 --> 02:22:45.954]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:22:46.274 --> 02:22:52.499]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:52.839 --> 02:22:53.960]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.683 --> 02:22:56.965]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:04.862]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[02:23:05.202 --> 02:23:12.745]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[02:23:12.985 --> 02:23:27.792]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[02:23:47.962 --> 02:23:48.763]  That's GoBerkey.com today!
[02:24:06.701 --> 02:24:08.302]  Your call is coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:08.322 --> 02:24:10.483]  We'll get into the economy, but this is the economy.
[02:24:11.084 --> 02:24:27.693]  The IMF and World Bank, in the leaked Danish text, the real version that's in the text of what they're going to introduce next week, they were going to keep it secret, it came out three days ago, to double, or right at double, the taxes on the third world over what the West has to pay.
[02:24:27.733 --> 02:24:32.556]  They suckered the third world into getting behind the treaty, telling them, oh, you're going to get America's money.
[02:24:32.816 --> 02:24:34.778]  You're going to get Europe and Britain and Japan's money.
[02:24:34.798 --> 02:24:34.838]  No.
[02:24:35.885 --> 02:24:39.009]  The banks get our money, and the banks get your money.
[02:24:39.589 --> 02:24:40.310]  Okay, you understand?
[02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:43.394]  They always play us off against each other, divide and conquer.
[02:24:44.315 --> 02:24:53.585]  And in their states, the World Bank and IMF will get all the money, totally dictatorial, the countries sign their sovereignty in a treaty, in a contract.
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:25:07.123]  And Obama said three days ago in Associated Press, they said, if the Senate doesn't ratify this, I will implement it by executive fiat, quote, command and control.
[02:25:07.223 --> 02:25:08.544]  And then now here's another headline.
[02:25:08.824 --> 02:25:17.386]  Now EU wants global transaction tax to fund bailouts, a direct transaction tax to the private banks.
[02:25:17.446 --> 02:25:17.946]  I mean, Bob,
[02:25:18.766 --> 02:25:22.829]  This is just like Madoff declaring himself king or something and everyone bowing down.
[02:25:23.089 --> 02:25:26.131]  Madoff, of course, was involved in this at the highest levels with Ken Lay.
[02:25:26.511 --> 02:25:27.852]  I mean, this is so criminal!
[02:25:28.472 --> 02:25:30.393]  This is so openly criminal!
[02:25:30.433 --> 02:25:31.974]  How does anyone go along with it, Bob?
[02:25:33.475 --> 02:25:35.637]  Well, they won't once they find out.
[02:25:35.757 --> 02:25:38.418]  And what that is is a transaction tax.
[02:25:39.059 --> 02:25:41.520]  And that is on securities transactions.
[02:25:42.601 --> 02:25:44.642]  And they've had that in the United States before.
[02:25:44.722 --> 02:25:46.964]  During the 1960s, they had such a tax.
[02:25:48.087 --> 02:25:50.649]  And it's just another way of raising revenue.
[02:25:51.470 --> 02:25:54.052]  And it's not good, of course.
[02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:57.935]  People don't need to pay any more taxes anywhere, for that matter.
[02:25:58.875 --> 02:26:16.149]  And yes, they also are allowing the rich countries, so to speak, to emit 2.67 tons of carbon per day, but the third world countries can only emit 1.44 tons per day.
[02:26:18.365 --> 02:26:18.545]  I don't
[02:26:30.538 --> 02:26:33.999]  Totally chauvinistic and, as you say, diabolical.
[02:26:34.079 --> 02:26:39.142]  And it's being sold as liberal to help Africa when it will admittedly kill them en masse.
[02:26:39.682 --> 02:26:41.603]  These people are on the edge of starvation.
[02:26:41.903 --> 02:26:43.043]  This will kill them.
[02:26:43.723 --> 02:26:46.845]  The ethanol scam killed 10 million extra last year.
[02:26:47.165 --> 02:26:48.285]  And then here's George Soros.
[02:26:48.345 --> 02:26:49.586]  Climate colonialism.
[02:26:49.926 --> 02:26:53.127]  Soros wants poorer nations to take on green debt.
[02:26:53.367 --> 02:26:55.128]  So Soros gets our tax money.
[02:26:55.128 --> 02:27:02.812]  No, and that, you know, the Gore family made their money with Arm and Hammer, and after the wall came down, the records of the Soviet Union became public.
[02:27:20.765 --> 02:27:29.236]  Uh, the Almanhama was identified by the former Soviets as a secret agent going back into the 1920s.
[02:27:29.357 --> 02:27:31.480]  He was a KGB agent.
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:35.005]  So the Gore family made their wealth by
[02:27:35.777 --> 02:27:39.260]  being involved in business deals with other Marxists.
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:45.225]  But at a higher level, correct me if I'm wrong, it's been declassified now, McCarthy was right.
[02:27:45.305 --> 02:27:48.608]  He found out that the army was running it and the banks were running it.
[02:27:48.848 --> 02:27:55.894]  They just created the communists as a rent-a-mob to go rob the czars and the people and make them slaves and call it revolution.
[02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:58.916]  And so Hammer was actually just working for the globalists.
[02:28:00.197 --> 02:28:00.698]  That's right.
[02:28:01.696 --> 02:28:13.141]  And I had met him many times because I was in the brokerages in Los Angeles and he would always be coming around with a dog and pony show about Occidental Petroleum.
[02:28:13.681 --> 02:28:20.964]  And I knew what he was doing at the time but I never brought it up in the meetings because I would be the only voice and everybody would look at me and say you're nuts.
[02:28:21.944 --> 02:28:25.626]  And of course that wasn't true and now we're proving all that.
[02:28:29.788 --> 02:28:30.508]  George Soros
[02:28:31.232 --> 02:28:43.222]  And I don't know if the listeners know his background, but as a teenager, he was a Hungarian Jew, and he passed himself off as being non-Jewish.
[02:28:44.023 --> 02:28:50.328]  And he worked with the Gestapo collecting other Jews to send them off to be exterminated.
[02:28:51.169 --> 02:28:57.334]  And what they would do is steal all the belongings that belonged to these poor people.
[02:28:58.295 --> 02:29:04.920]  And they would divvy it up among the the Gestapo people and him and others who helped him.
[02:29:06.021 --> 02:29:08.282]  And so that's how George got his start.
[02:29:09.623 --> 02:29:10.364]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:10.424 --> 02:29:12.145]  You know, let's talk about that a little bit more.
[02:29:12.225 --> 02:29:13.146]  An arm and a hammer.
[02:29:13.186 --> 02:29:14.306]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, Alex.
[02:29:14.667 --> 02:29:17.048]  He's been convicted of stock fraud twice.
[02:29:18.169 --> 02:29:22.192]  Once in Paris and he appealed the decision and they threw the appeal out.
[02:29:22.694 --> 02:29:29.998]  And just recently, in the last year, he was convicted of stock fraud, and in both instances paid large fines.
[02:29:30.218 --> 02:29:30.759]  Well, stay there.
[02:29:30.779 --> 02:29:31.519]  We've got a break.
[02:29:31.559 --> 02:29:32.279]  We've got a break, Bob.
[02:29:32.299 --> 02:29:33.720]  I want you to come back and finish the story.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:34.721]  That's why I was saying, hold on.
[02:29:34.741 --> 02:29:36.602]  I want you to take your time on that.
[02:29:37.382 --> 02:29:42.985]  Take your time on the other chief guy running all this, other than Al Gore, and that's Maury Strong.
[02:29:43.025 --> 02:29:44.226]  He can't come to the U.S.
[02:29:44.266 --> 02:29:46.988]  for oil for food, starving Iraqis for money.
[02:29:47.328 --> 02:29:48.028]  Stay there, Bob.
[02:29:48.048 --> 02:29:49.009]  We'll come right back to you.
[02:29:51.317 --> 02:29:52.217]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.697 --> 02:29:54.318]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.238 --> 02:29:57.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:05.621]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:30:05.761 --> 02:30:10.142]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:30:10.283 --> 02:30:12.143]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:30:12.563 --> 02:30:13.924]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:30:14.184 --> 02:30:15.224]  There is a solution.
[02:30:15.464 --> 02:30:23.473]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:30:23.893 --> 02:30:30.980]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:31:00.319 --> 02:31:04.561]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.881 --> 02:31:05.482]  Number one.
[02:31:05.782 --> 02:31:08.943]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.203 --> 02:31:09.784]  Number two.
[02:31:10.064 --> 02:31:14.626]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.966 --> 02:31:15.426]  It's true.
[02:31:15.707 --> 02:31:20.249]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.569 --> 02:31:21.110]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.390 --> 02:31:24.694]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:28.719]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.899 --> 02:31:29.440]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:32.083]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.464 --> 02:31:35.848]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.148 --> 02:31:36.349]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.909 --> 02:31:40.831]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.052 --> 02:31:45.834]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.115 --> 02:31:50.137]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.297 --> 02:31:51.838]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:00.745 --> 02:32:03.348]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:03.769 --> 02:32:08.734]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:09.095 --> 02:32:10.837]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:11.157 --> 02:32:15.963]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:16.143 --> 02:32:17.064]  How much do you want?
[02:32:17.304 --> 02:32:18.064]  When do you want it?
[02:32:18.444 --> 02:32:20.045]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:20.325 --> 02:32:21.146]  When will you need it?
[02:32:21.406 --> 02:32:23.467]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:23.607 --> 02:32:24.707]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:24.947 --> 02:32:26.268]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:26.468 --> 02:32:31.550]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:34.911]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.311 --> 02:32:38.793]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.133 --> 02:32:40.114]  How much will you need?
[02:32:40.354 --> 02:32:40.975]  We don't know.
[02:32:41.255 --> 02:32:42.176]  How much do you want?
[02:32:42.376 --> 02:32:43.116]  All you can get.
[02:32:43.297 --> 02:32:44.157]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.398 --> 02:32:47.160]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:49.202]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:49.222 --> 02:32:50.142]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:17.398 --> 02:33:21.541]  We're going to your phone calls in about 7 minutes.
[02:33:21.561 --> 02:33:23.043]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:23.643 --> 02:33:30.068]  Bob Chapman, for those that don't know, we have a lot of new listeners every minute tuning in, getting so many new AM and FM affiliates.
[02:33:31.569 --> 02:33:35.533]  Bob helped publish and write the book, None Dare Call It Conspiracy.
[02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:41.597]  I talked to all the old timers, and Bob Chapman was right there fighting them the entire time for almost 50 years.
[02:33:43.246 --> 02:33:48.249]  And so he can really, and he's been in high levels of business, so he knows a lot of these people, and he knows their histories.
[02:33:48.869 --> 02:33:50.390]  So take your time talking to me.
[02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:57.133]  Madeleine Albright's dad in Czechoslovakia, it was the famous Soviet that robbed over a million people.
[02:33:57.493 --> 02:34:00.015]  When the Nazis came, they had to run to Serbia.
[02:34:00.395 --> 02:34:01.155]  It came out on the news.
[02:34:01.195 --> 02:34:03.676]  She had all that Holocaust art in her house that was taken.
[02:34:03.696 --> 02:34:05.017]  That was on 60 Minutes.
[02:34:05.037 --> 02:34:07.158]  People noticed Holocaust famous paintings behind her.
[02:34:07.478 --> 02:34:08.779]  She admitted it and said, I'm keeping it.
[02:34:08.899 --> 02:34:09.960]  You know, basically go to hell.
[02:34:11.481 --> 02:34:14.804]  Soros, of course, worked for the Nazis.
[02:34:15.565 --> 02:34:17.526]  Others worked for the Soviets, the Gors.
[02:34:18.127 --> 02:34:19.588]  I mean, they worked for killer thugs.
[02:34:19.628 --> 02:34:20.369]  It's who they are.
[02:34:21.170 --> 02:34:24.413]  Then you have John Shalikashvili, the former chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:34:24.693 --> 02:34:30.699]  His dad was the head Nazi general for the Polish turncoat that worked for the Nazis in Poland.
[02:34:31.259 --> 02:34:33.441]  I mean, it's only a few families.
[02:34:34.222 --> 02:34:39.423]  And these people know how to take over governments, have coups, and that's what their global carbon tax is.
[02:34:39.443 --> 02:34:41.483]  So Bob Chapman, you've got the floor.
[02:34:41.984 --> 02:34:48.445]  Finish, recap your George Soros story, the global taxes, what they're doing to the third world, Arm and Hammer, all of it.
[02:34:48.725 --> 02:34:49.665]  Bob Chapman, tell us.
[02:34:51.285 --> 02:34:56.286]  Well, George Soros, as I said, had been convicted twice of stock fraud.
[02:34:56.946 --> 02:34:59.307]  And this is in recent times, this is not 30 or 40 years ago.
[02:35:01.139 --> 02:35:22.218]  And he was the one who was given the inside information in the early 1990s by the royal family that the pound was going to break away from the European currencies and the result would be that the pound would fall in value.
[02:35:22.998 --> 02:35:27.983]  And so George shorted the pound and made billions and billions of dollars.
[02:35:29.329 --> 02:35:34.132]  These people don't make money because they're extra smart.
[02:35:34.492 --> 02:35:37.374]  They all have inside information.
[02:35:38.235 --> 02:35:39.776]  And that's a very good example of it.
[02:35:40.356 --> 02:35:43.037]  And in the United States today, Warren Buffett's another one.
[02:35:43.057 --> 02:35:52.783]  You know, he's brought around like the Grand Poobah and the All-Knowing One, when in fact most of his deals are either in collaboration with the U.S.
[02:35:52.823 --> 02:35:55.005]  government or directly with the U.S.
[02:35:55.025 --> 02:35:55.425]  government.
[02:35:56.145 --> 02:36:23.188]  The reason that he just recently bought the railroad was to get carbon credits so that he could engage in the carbon trading and incidentally in Europe they're already doing carbon trading and they have a big scandal going on about how the carbon rates are all fixed and everybody's getting ripped off and it'll be in tomorrow's issue of the forecaster and
[02:36:24.226 --> 02:36:33.592]  But getting back to Soros, he also, and when these people die, people like Soros, their wealth is then turned over to the Illuminati.
[02:36:34.372 --> 02:36:36.534]  And I've seen it happen time and time again.
[02:36:37.074 --> 02:36:45.299]  And so they've got a goodwill here, they do what they're supposed to do, and they live powerful and luxurious lives.
[02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:56.934]  Soros used a good part of his money to foment these revolutions in all these Eastern European countries.
[02:36:58.195 --> 02:37:00.996]  The Pink Revolution, the Blue Revolution, whatever they were called.
[02:37:01.556 --> 02:37:02.957]  And that was his money doing that.
[02:37:03.737 --> 02:37:10.260]  And he also has been the biggest proponent for the legal use of marijuana.
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:12.621]  He's been pushing it for some years.
[02:37:13.853 --> 02:37:18.857]  As far as Albright's concerned, yes, her father was a first-class crook.
[02:37:19.737 --> 02:37:21.299]  But, you know, he's one of the families.
[02:37:21.999 --> 02:37:28.444]  And it was interesting that probably about 10 years ago, she just discovered that she was Jewish.
[02:37:29.384 --> 02:37:32.667]  And so that was no revelation because she knew from the beginning.
[02:37:33.167 --> 02:37:35.669]  And where did they get all of the art wealth that they had?
[02:37:36.129 --> 02:37:38.031]  They took it all from Jewish people.
[02:37:38.871 --> 02:37:41.273]  And so she and her father
[02:37:42.537 --> 02:38:02.870]  Just like the Gores and the Soroses and others have gleaned this tremendous amount of wealth by doing exactly what the Illuminists want them to do, whether it's within the communist structure, the fascist structure, the socialist structure, etc.
[02:38:04.071 --> 02:38:10.235]  They have their mission, they're told what to do, and they get their orders and training and information
[02:38:11.235 --> 02:38:16.219]  From foundations and think tanks, which are funded by these people.
[02:38:16.879 --> 02:38:21.743]  And so, the way I envision it, they say, look, here's a syllabus.
[02:38:22.103 --> 02:38:22.723]  You study it.
[02:38:23.084 --> 02:38:24.245]  This is what you've got to do.
[02:38:24.905 --> 02:38:28.288]  And for that, you'll get, you know, $80 billion or whatever the figure is.
[02:38:29.048 --> 02:38:30.409]  And this is the way this thing works.
[02:38:31.410 --> 02:38:38.415]  And it worms its way all over the world into companies and governments and
[02:38:39.131 --> 02:38:51.640]  Banking and not everybody in banking and the brokerage industry or the insurance industry or in manufacturing or whatever throughout the world are involved in this.
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:53.481]  There's a lot of good people out there.
[02:38:54.362 --> 02:39:08.032]  And a lot of people who are invited to join groups like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Group of 30 and the Group of 300 and the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderbergers and on and on and on.
[02:39:10.136 --> 02:39:13.478]  Some of them get out, but not many.
[02:39:14.038 --> 02:39:21.522]  I mean, the power and the money is so fabulous that these people can't help themselves.
[02:39:22.642 --> 02:39:32.286]  And so, going back to Hama, Hama's father was a high official in the Communist Party in the United States.
[02:39:32.326 --> 02:39:33.307]  He wasn't called that.
[02:39:34.247 --> 02:39:35.968]  Eventually he was called a communist.
[02:39:36.949 --> 02:39:37.589]  Hama always
[02:39:38.682 --> 02:39:41.224]  He said that he wasn't a communist, and of course he was.
[02:39:42.925 --> 02:39:45.566]  This is a number of books on his history.
[02:39:48.027 --> 02:39:51.069]  He had this large oil concession in Libya.
[02:39:52.430 --> 02:39:55.972]  He got that by paying off for it, which is illegal, of course.
[02:39:56.692 --> 02:39:59.854]  The same thing that Halliburton just got caught doing.
[02:39:59.874 --> 02:40:04.737]  You've got to understand that these people are all in this together.
[02:40:05.958 --> 02:40:08.139]  They buy the politicians in every country.
[02:40:09.266 --> 02:40:10.708]  They create revolutions.
[02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:12.510]  They create wars.
[02:40:14.852 --> 02:40:18.675]  They, you know, like America, they've never seen a dictator that they didn't like.
[02:40:19.977 --> 02:40:23.900]  Look at the school that they had at Fort Benning.
[02:40:24.801 --> 02:40:27.724]  Still there under a new name, but Bob, that's a great point you make.
[02:40:29.935 --> 02:40:33.718]  That look at how our government sets up dictatorships all over the world.
[02:40:33.878 --> 02:40:35.519]  Of course they're getting rid of Northcom.
[02:40:35.879 --> 02:40:37.540]  Of course they're putting police on the street.
[02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:43.404]  The federal government today financed a paper by RAND to create a new U.S.
[02:40:43.584 --> 02:40:44.805]  Army police force.
[02:40:45.265 --> 02:40:50.629]  Now we know they're going to put regular army on the streets and are already doing it, but now they're announcing, no, we're going to have federal U.S.
[02:40:50.729 --> 02:40:51.430]  Army troops
[02:40:52.170 --> 02:40:56.352]  And they're just going to patrol America and they're going to write tickets and everything.
[02:40:56.392 --> 02:41:00.213]  I mean, that's total Guatemala, total Stalin Russia.
[02:41:00.453 --> 02:41:02.474]  I mean, that's grade A certified.
[02:41:03.134 --> 02:41:05.475]  It's just totally illegitimate criminal government.
[02:41:05.495 --> 02:41:07.056]  And you say, well, the military will stand up.
[02:41:07.456 --> 02:41:09.597]  And I know the military are really tuning in in droves.
[02:41:09.857 --> 02:41:10.637]  They're waking up.
[02:41:10.697 --> 02:41:13.078]  They know previously they were taught this was bad.
[02:41:13.438 --> 02:41:14.519]  Now they're being told it's good.
[02:41:15.379 --> 02:41:21.902]  They're having Marine Corps, Army, National Guard, where they run checkpoints in Tennessee, California, Texas, Iowa.
[02:41:22.142 --> 02:41:23.842]  They do gun confiscation drills.
[02:41:24.163 --> 02:41:25.143]  It's now in the paper.
[02:41:25.803 --> 02:41:29.165]  And the troops go, yeah, I'm out here running checkpoints for drunks.
[02:41:29.205 --> 02:41:32.006]  I mean, what's wrong with stopping drunks just to set the precedent?
[02:41:32.626 --> 02:41:38.010]  And so, they're certainly trying to do this, and using staged terror attacks to sell it.
[02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:41.652]  And conservatives have been sold, well if it's anti-terror, I'm for it.
[02:41:41.933 --> 02:41:45.475]  But conservatives need to know, we got the MIAC report from the police.
[02:41:45.555 --> 02:41:46.235]  We released it.
[02:41:46.516 --> 02:41:48.537]  We got the Homeland Security report.
[02:41:48.697 --> 02:41:49.177]  I got it.
[02:41:49.758 --> 02:41:50.278]  I released it.
[02:41:50.318 --> 02:41:55.182]  People couldn't believe it was real for two days, until the Feds admitted, yes, Jones shouldn't have that.
[02:41:55.822 --> 02:41:57.963]  And I had the Feds calling up saying, who gave that to you?
[02:41:57.983 --> 02:41:59.764]  And I said, go take a hike, buddy.
[02:41:59.784 --> 02:42:00.945]  It's still America.
[02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:04.787]  And it said, Homeland Security is for the American people.
[02:42:05.108 --> 02:42:09.430]  Gun owners, veterans, conservatives, libertarians, people that protest the Fed.
[02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:13.753]  We always knew it was for us, because we're the real Americans.
[02:42:14.073 --> 02:42:15.173]  We're the good guys.
[02:42:15.534 --> 02:42:18.515]  Homeland Security is to stop the good guys.
[02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:19.276]  Bob Chapman.
[02:42:20.777 --> 02:42:24.399]  Well, you're absolutely right, and that's the federalization process.
[02:42:25.251 --> 02:42:33.356]  And that will sweep through all of the police departments and eventually through all the state agencies.
[02:42:34.536 --> 02:42:36.337]  This is monstrous what's going on.
[02:42:37.018 --> 02:42:44.042]  And you know, the American people who are listening to this, you have got to tell other people about this.
[02:42:44.542 --> 02:42:51.706]  You have to talk about it in all the meetings that you're having politically at the lower levels in the state and cities and the towns.
[02:42:52.346 --> 02:42:53.207]  And you have to
[02:42:53.809 --> 02:43:01.975]  Continually barrage all the congressmen, all the senators, and tell them you don't want them to do this and don't want them to do that.
[02:43:02.895 --> 02:43:06.117]  You know, it's the only legal avenue open to you.
[02:43:06.698 --> 02:43:19.326]  And if you can, you should go with these groups that meet and go to Washington, what was it, two million people, tea parties, other kinds of groups all over the country.
[02:43:19.826 --> 02:43:23.409]  If you don't do it, you're going to end up in an internment camp.
[02:43:25.362 --> 02:43:29.445]  And by the way, Bob, you were in Army Intelligence in Europe against the Soviets.
[02:43:29.465 --> 02:43:30.706]  You've lived in Paris.
[02:43:30.726 --> 02:43:32.507]  You've lived in South Africa.
[02:43:32.567 --> 02:43:35.509]  You've lived and did a lot of work in black ops.
[02:43:36.049 --> 02:43:37.930]  And that's how you discovered the New World Order.
[02:43:38.731 --> 02:43:43.254]  People that study history like you and I, who spend all our time researching this, and you've lived it.
[02:43:44.185 --> 02:43:46.186]  And these people are truly demented.
[02:44:18.254 --> 02:44:18.654]  They are.
[02:44:18.694 --> 02:44:23.778]  They are truly, truly, truly, truly demented.
[02:44:23.878 --> 02:44:26.640]  And people need to understand, this is life and death, folks.
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:36.287]  They're putting in the face scanners, the license plate readers are already in, they're already tracking everything, they're already admitting their... I mean, it's just, it's hell.
[02:44:36.908 --> 02:44:39.530]  I mean, and the military and police listening.
[02:44:40.891 --> 02:44:43.533]  Folks, they are spiking your vaccines and water.
[02:44:43.573 --> 02:44:44.814]  Bob, you want to explain that to them?
[02:44:48.593 --> 02:44:50.134]  They've been doing it for a long time.
[02:44:50.275 --> 02:44:51.616]  It's just we didn't know about it.
[02:44:52.276 --> 02:44:55.079]  And if they can put chlorine in, they can put anything else in.
[02:44:55.119 --> 02:45:06.288]  And as Alex said earlier, they're getting all kinds of drugs in bodies of water that are nowhere near pollution that are used for drinking water.
[02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:17.397]  They're hitting these reservoirs and the feed is to reservoirs before the water ever gets to be processed.
[02:45:20.034 --> 02:45:24.537]  I don't know what they're doing with the private water as far as bottled water is concerned.
[02:45:24.557 --> 02:45:25.378]  Do you know that, Alex?
[02:45:26.158 --> 02:45:33.804]  Well, they picked a plastic in the 50s out of thousands of formulae, the only type that sloughs massive estrogen mimickers.
[02:45:34.065 --> 02:45:34.745]  And that's a fact.
[02:45:34.785 --> 02:45:35.426]  They admit that.
[02:45:35.966 --> 02:45:37.027]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[02:45:37.067 --> 02:45:37.607]  Just Google...
[02:45:38.646 --> 02:45:40.648]  Plastics sterilizing.
[02:45:40.708 --> 02:45:43.810]  Plastics sterilizing men.
[02:45:44.711 --> 02:45:48.594]  Or plastics releasing estrogen mimickers.
[02:45:48.914 --> 02:45:50.696]  And you'll get thousands of articles.
[02:45:50.776 --> 02:45:51.296]  It's admitted.
[02:45:51.677 --> 02:45:53.218]  Here's one out of CBS News.
[02:45:53.238 --> 02:45:54.219]  And this is a whitewash.
[02:45:54.339 --> 02:45:54.819]  Remember that.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:45:58.802]  Mutant polio virus spreads in Nigeria.
[02:45:58.822 --> 02:45:59.283]  124 children affected.
[02:46:01.212 --> 02:46:03.014]  I looked up the actual number, it was tens of thousands.
[02:46:03.395 --> 02:46:08.481]  This year by paralyzing disease believed to be caused by same vaccine used to fight it.
[02:46:09.001 --> 02:46:09.943]  Oh, it's an accident.
[02:46:10.223 --> 02:46:11.104]  But then you pull it up.
[02:46:11.845 --> 02:46:17.692]  Dozens and dozens of countries with weaponized polio vaccine killing and maiming the children.
[02:46:21.050 --> 02:46:36.653]  And you know, there is an enormous group of people who are involved in this conspiracy, and that's exactly what it is, who are pedophiles and other deviants.
[02:46:37.754 --> 02:46:38.474]  Again, the U.N.
[02:46:38.514 --> 02:46:39.174]  has been caught.
[02:46:39.394 --> 02:46:40.294]  Hundreds of articles.
[02:46:40.734 --> 02:46:42.955]  Everywhere they go, they run child kidnapping rings.
[02:46:42.995 --> 02:46:43.335]  Go ahead.
[02:46:44.745 --> 02:46:53.808]  And what they want to do in eventually controlling you will be able to control your children so that they can use them as they want to.
[02:46:54.629 --> 02:46:58.290]  And it is so rampant, it's unbelievable.
[02:46:59.470 --> 02:47:01.951]  You know, I went to Rome one time.
[02:47:03.332 --> 02:47:07.633]  They wanted me to take over the Observatory Romano.
[02:47:08.233 --> 02:47:12.775]  And of course, at that time, I didn't know anything about how to run a newspaper.
[02:47:13.562 --> 02:47:20.623]  And the editor had died, and his wife was running it, and they wanted myself and somebody else to run the paper.
[02:47:21.604 --> 02:47:26.165]  And the front page of the paper, Henry Kissinger's in town.
[02:47:26.625 --> 02:47:27.525]  Hide your children.
[02:47:28.525 --> 02:47:29.405]  I'll never forget it.
[02:47:30.085 --> 02:47:33.246]  Of course, you wouldn't see that kind of a headline in the United States.
[02:47:34.066 --> 02:47:36.487]  But Kissinger is a famous pedophile.
[02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:41.328]  As is Gordon Brown and the Bushes, and I could go on and on.
[02:47:41.708 --> 02:47:42.568]  There's millions of them.
[02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:49.641]  And they'll have a field day with children once they are able to take over.
[02:47:50.162 --> 02:47:54.069]  And so that's what is in the future for your children and grandchildren.
[02:47:55.959 --> 02:47:59.821]  Devastating information, devastating information with Bob Chapman.
[02:48:00.182 --> 02:48:02.763]  My goodness, if it was coming from anybody else, I wouldn't know what to say.
[02:48:03.424 --> 02:48:09.648]  Coming from him, I don't know what to say, but I've been to Bohemian Grove, I know about Skull and Bones, and the sky's the limit for these people.
[02:48:09.708 --> 02:48:10.988]  Let's take some calls.
[02:48:11.208 --> 02:48:14.050]  Lee in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:48:14.931 --> 02:48:16.752]  Hey Alex, hi Bob, great show.
[02:48:16.812 --> 02:48:19.193]  I don't know how I get anything done.
[02:48:19.293 --> 02:48:20.834]  Bob, it's great to listen to you.
[02:48:21.315 --> 02:48:22.495]  I did want to comment on
[02:48:24.313 --> 02:48:47.243]  On something about Ron Paul and HR 1207, I just finished, or finishing up a macroeconomics class, and I believe I'll be getting an A or a B. And I've been trying to get the teacher to understand HR 1207 and the importance of auditing the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:48.004 --> 02:48:52.846]  I just got a message from him.
[02:48:53.402 --> 02:48:59.708]  And I get a chance to write some closing comments for the rest of the students and the teacher to see.
[02:49:01.410 --> 02:49:13.662]  Any suggestions on a short little blurb to write down so people can... We don't really know what your paper's about, so it's hard for us to help you.
[02:49:14.883 --> 02:49:15.484]  It's just about...
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:21.183]  It's about macroeconomics and what's going on in Africa.
[02:49:22.444 --> 02:49:33.652]  I would give them a Thomas Jefferson quote about if we ever allow private banks to take over the issuance of currency and credit, our children will wake up homeless on the continent we conquered.
[02:49:34.652 --> 02:49:47.983]  And I would give him some quotes by Jefferson about everything is the money power, this parasitic system that if you took all the power away from the bankers today, tomorrow they would write themselves a new fiat check for the rest of the world.
[02:49:48.323 --> 02:49:48.984]  Bob Chapman?
[02:49:50.565 --> 02:49:53.647]  Well, he was exactly right and that was a long time ago.
[02:49:54.508 --> 02:49:58.471]  And so we're fighting this enemy for over a thousand years.
[02:49:59.432 --> 02:50:01.754]  And you know, when I say that, and Alex says it,
[02:50:02.475 --> 02:50:03.916]  People say, well, gee, that couldn't be.
[02:50:05.577 --> 02:50:06.377]  Tell us about it.
[02:50:07.177 --> 02:50:10.139]  But it's not something you can capsulize in five minutes.
[02:50:10.819 --> 02:50:12.540]  You have to go back and study it yourself.
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:14.561]  Either that or you're going to have to take our word for it.
[02:50:15.302 --> 02:50:17.743]  And that's why we're on the air, because we're here to help you.
[02:50:18.283 --> 02:50:19.324]  We're not selling anything.
[02:50:19.344 --> 02:50:20.364]  We're not doing anything.
[02:50:20.764 --> 02:50:22.986]  We're just saying, look, this is what's going on.
[02:50:23.666 --> 02:50:24.987]  You've got to become aware of it.
[02:50:25.547 --> 02:50:26.968]  You have to do something about it.
[02:50:27.448 --> 02:50:31.310]  If you don't, you're not going to like the way that you're going to have to live in the future.
[02:50:31.883 --> 02:50:37.845]  And all you have to do is read the publications and the announcements of the people who are involved in this.
[02:50:38.565 --> 02:50:39.586]  And you'll get the message.
[02:50:39.666 --> 02:50:50.029]  And you've got to let Congress and you've got to let everybody in politics know that you know what they're doing or you know what they should be doing to stop this.
[02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:51.030]  Absolutely.
[02:50:51.050 --> 02:50:52.650]  People have yet to get up in arms.
[02:50:53.431 --> 02:50:54.731]  You've got to get angry, folks.
[02:50:55.371 --> 02:50:59.813]  Planetary government is being set up by people that want to cut your resources off and kill you?
[02:51:01.513 --> 02:51:02.954]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:51:03.614 --> 02:51:08.438]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:51:09.478 --> 02:51:17.604]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[02:51:18.465 --> 02:51:20.366]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:26.684]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:51:27.185 --> 02:51:29.907]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[02:51:30.447 --> 02:51:32.169]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:51:32.829 --> 02:51:37.433]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[02:51:37.713 --> 02:51:40.976]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:51:41.476 --> 02:51:43.098]  So get it while you still can.
[02:51:43.698 --> 02:51:46.941]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.

[02:51:58.634 --> 02:52:00.135]  This call could save your life.
[02:52:02.276 --> 02:52:05.958]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.298 --> 02:52:09.299]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.539 --> 02:52:10.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.664 --> 02:52:14.305]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.325 --> 02:52:20.566]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.726 --> 02:52:25.747]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.908 --> 02:52:35.890]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.010 --> 02:52:38.131]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.372 --> 02:52:39.692]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.952 --> 02:52:42.234]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.414 --> 02:52:44.255]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.535 --> 02:52:49.318]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.679 --> 02:52:54.481]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:53:50.608 --> 02:53:52.170]  That's 866-404-3663 or go to freezedryguy.com.
[02:53:52.310 --> 02:53:52.710]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[02:53:52.730 --> 02:53:53.671]  The best you can buy.
[02:54:05.402 --> 02:54:08.384]  Continuing with phone calls with Bob Chapman.
[02:54:08.844 --> 02:54:13.107]  Hey, I forgot to ask you during the break, Bob, you want to stay 15 minutes in the next hour so we can take more calls?
[02:54:13.127 --> 02:54:14.448]  Of course.
[02:54:15.329 --> 02:54:15.669]  Awesome.
[02:54:16.850 --> 02:54:18.811]  Let's go to David in Georgia.
[02:54:18.831 --> 02:54:19.431]  You're on the air.
[02:54:19.491 --> 02:54:19.952]  Go ahead.
[02:54:20.932 --> 02:54:21.273]  Hello.
[02:54:22.393 --> 02:54:25.495]  I was watching something on Democracy Now!
[02:54:25.576 --> 02:54:30.559]  where they were talking about this lady named Yvonne Yanez who heads a group called Action
[02:54:31.328 --> 02:54:32.389]  We're good to go.
[02:54:49.417 --> 02:54:50.718]  So that they don't produce oil.
[02:54:51.138 --> 02:54:51.638]  No, no, no.
[02:54:51.678 --> 02:54:53.399]  That's what George Soros is saying.
[02:54:54.020 --> 02:54:59.063]  They will give payoffs to the governments not to develop and not to bring resources out.
[02:54:59.603 --> 02:55:04.706]  Because then it creates artificial scarcity because the globalists already control most the resources.
[02:55:05.146 --> 02:55:09.009]  So by shutting down other people... Remember Bill Clinton in 1996-97?
[02:55:09.029 --> 02:55:09.869]  The only clean burning coal
[02:55:13.411 --> 02:55:13.671]  I think?
[02:55:36.018 --> 02:55:42.104]  Well, it's exactly the way it happened, and that was a gift to the Chinese, and of course, they get paid off.
[02:55:58.547 --> 02:56:03.749]  I mean, the skullduggery that has gone on is just incredible.
[02:56:04.089 --> 02:56:09.491]  I mean, these are the inside stories that you're just not going to get from the major media which these people own.
[02:56:09.771 --> 02:56:15.474]  And of course, a useful idiot like Robert Redford that went out there and stopped it from happening, he goes home and feels good.
[02:56:16.314 --> 02:56:22.176]  He doesn't know that he's contributing to energy loss and genocide worldwide because this hurts the third world the worst.
[02:56:22.196 --> 02:56:22.556]  Go ahead.
[02:56:24.717 --> 02:56:27.078]  Well, I think there are a lot of people
[02:56:27.961 --> 02:56:33.105]  In the environmental and green area that mean very, very well.
[02:56:33.645 --> 02:56:37.448]  But they just don't understand some of the things that we do.
[02:56:37.508 --> 02:56:40.770]  And when you tell them, most of them don't want to listen, unfortunately.
[02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:44.132]  I mean, they're steadfast in what they believe in.
[02:56:44.813 --> 02:56:47.775]  And I think they should be more selective.
[02:56:48.616 --> 02:56:58.644]  And it's a shame, because when you have a big name, because you're a movie star or something of that sort, people tend to listen to you, whether you're qualified or not.
[02:56:59.125 --> 02:56:59.966]  David, anything else?
[02:57:00.846 --> 02:57:01.247]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:02.368 --> 02:57:05.010]  I remember there was this company called Gabriel Resources.
[02:57:05.070 --> 02:57:07.172]  They had this huge mountain in Romania.
[02:57:07.572 --> 02:57:09.914]  It's been used since the Roman Empire.
[02:57:10.254 --> 02:57:11.915]  It's already a brownfield area.
[02:57:12.576 --> 02:57:16.940]  And they have these George Soros NGOs lobbying the
[02:57:17.819 --> 02:57:18.300]  We're good to go.
[02:57:38.854 --> 02:57:42.295]  There's a film called Mind Your Own Business that talks about that.
[02:57:57.065 --> 02:58:15.209]  Then they come back five years later and they say, we'll give you ten cents on the dollar for the land, and then as soon as they have it, the mayor that did it opens his own bank and gives the land to himself publicly, makes Madoff look like a... and then just openly builds hotels and houses on it.
[02:58:15.569 --> 02:58:18.251]  And if you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by and murder you and your family.
[02:58:18.271 --> 02:58:20.493]  I mean, you know, that's how it works here in Austin.
[02:58:20.513 --> 02:58:27.558]  It's like, we rule you, we own you, you are slaves, we have weapons, we have men in black uniforms who love to kill people!
[02:58:27.818 --> 02:58:28.258]  Shut up!
[02:58:28.318 --> 02:58:29.179]  We own you now!
[02:58:29.539 --> 02:58:30.019]  Shut up!
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:31.461]  Drink the tap water!
[02:58:31.501 --> 02:58:32.361]  Drink the poison!
[02:58:32.421 --> 02:58:32.982]  Shut up!
[02:58:33.562 --> 02:58:34.523]  Bob Chapman, stay there.
[02:58:34.543 --> 02:58:38.666]  I'm gonna come back to you in 70 seconds as we enter the fourth and final hour and take more calls.
[02:58:42.989 --> 02:58:44.510]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.438 --> 02:58:47.819]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.401 --> 02:58:55.604]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:58:55.704 --> 02:59:00.107]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:59:00.247 --> 02:59:02.088]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:59:02.508 --> 02:59:03.869]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:59:04.129 --> 02:59:05.190]  There is a solution.
[02:59:05.410 --> 02:59:13.414]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:59:27.322 --> 02:59:32.907]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:59:53.507 --> 02:59:55.411]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:55.912 --> 02:59:58.677]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.884 --> 03:00:23.156]  I mean it's really tough watching criminals run wild and steal land and property and people's children and spike the water supply and openly announce they're going to cut off our resources and
[03:00:25.074 --> 03:00:31.396]  Arrest you if you have more than one child and enforce it to the Chinese model and our government praising the Chinese model.
[03:00:31.796 --> 03:00:42.979]  Notice, Bob Chapman, overnight we've gone from decrying China's secret arrest and infanticide and taking political dissidents' organs, which is all admitted, to suddenly just saying none of it exists.
[03:00:43.039 --> 03:00:43.919]  China's wonderful.
[03:00:44.279 --> 03:00:45.140]  We love China.
[03:00:45.500 --> 03:00:48.721]  They've been positioned to be the muscle for the New World Order.
[03:00:48.741 --> 03:00:49.661]  Do you agree with that statement?
[03:00:50.606 --> 03:00:58.891]  I think that's a good one, and I would think that if there's disruption in the United States, they would be the first ones who would be called to bring in troops.
[03:01:01.112 --> 03:01:14.840]  And by the way, if people can't believe that NLE 09 four months ago, FEMA, just Google NLE, National Level Exercise 09, and it says troops from 14 countries are here training with us to put down a U.S.
[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:15.380]  rebellion.
[03:01:15.981 --> 03:01:18.182]  Open public foreign troops, Bob.
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:19.981]  That's right.
[03:01:20.441 --> 03:01:22.202]  And they were here for, what, six weeks?
[03:01:22.803 --> 03:01:23.023]  Yeah.
[03:01:24.324 --> 03:01:25.545]  They actually just kept it going.
[03:01:25.585 --> 03:01:27.146]  They just scaled it down after six weeks.
[03:01:27.747 --> 03:01:29.508]  I mean, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[03:01:29.568 --> 03:01:30.029]  B.B.
[03:01:30.509 --> 03:01:31.490]  in North Carolina.
[03:01:31.530 --> 03:01:32.431]  B.B., you're on the air.
[03:01:34.252 --> 03:01:35.133]  Good day, gentlemen.
[03:01:35.213 --> 03:01:38.156]  I just wanted to have a question for you and Bob Chapman.
[03:01:40.117 --> 03:01:42.639]  Is Obama preparing for civil war in U.S.?
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:45.702]  This article is even more disturbing
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:49.321]  And all the other stuff, even with the global warming fraud.
[03:01:49.341 --> 03:01:50.361]  Who wrote that?
[03:01:50.421 --> 03:01:50.981]  Who wrote that?
[03:01:51.141 --> 03:01:52.382]  Guys, print me that article.
[03:01:52.442 --> 03:01:54.142]  Is Obama preparing for civil war in the U.S.?
[03:01:54.402 --> 03:01:55.062]  Who wrote that?
[03:01:55.762 --> 03:01:56.123]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:56.163 --> 03:01:57.163]  It's Chuck Baldwin.
[03:01:57.183 --> 03:02:04.965]  It's on your website, but I think the only thing more horrible or terrible would be a civil war.
[03:02:05.785 --> 03:02:08.486]  FEMA admits they're preparing for civil war, so yes.
[03:02:09.406 --> 03:02:09.606]  Right.
[03:02:09.646 --> 03:02:12.567]  The only thing I could think worse than civil war would be general
[03:02:13.391 --> 03:02:40.819]  uh... uh... strategic thermonuclear warfare but what i want my weapons are even worse what i would like to ask uh... you about chapman was webster carpley talks in his books uh... i've got all his books when you're out there and he talked about stuff that obama what could possibly usher in civil war uh... you know area general meltdown disintegration of the u.s.
[03:02:40.879 --> 03:02:41.319]  banking
[03:02:41.818 --> 03:02:52.901]  At some point next year, the thermodynamic breakdown in the economy, bank runs, that would precipitate a civil war.
[03:02:53.341 --> 03:02:57.522]  And what Igor Panarin talks about the collapse of the U.S.
[03:02:58.322 --> 03:03:02.483]  in late June, early July, starting in 2010.
[03:03:02.883 --> 03:03:04.204]  I'll take your comments off the air.
[03:03:04.244 --> 03:03:04.584]  Thank you.
[03:03:05.704 --> 03:03:06.804]  Bob Chapman comments.
[03:03:07.744 --> 03:03:09.165]  Well, Panarin has said that.
[03:03:10.658 --> 03:03:18.042]  He is also looking for a collapse in the financial system in the United States, and of course it'll spread throughout the world.
[03:03:18.442 --> 03:03:19.483]  No one will be spared.
[03:03:19.983 --> 03:03:21.864]  And that's by design to consolidate power.
[03:03:23.025 --> 03:03:23.525]  Exactly.
[03:03:24.185 --> 03:03:32.650]  And I'm expecting that they will, late in 2010, there will be a meeting of all countries' representatives
[03:03:33.306 --> 03:03:36.128]  And I think they'll revalue, devalue currencies.
[03:03:36.288 --> 03:03:38.010]  I think that the U.S.
[03:03:38.050 --> 03:03:39.611]  government will devalue.
[03:03:41.112 --> 03:03:55.142]  No one knows for sure what the devaluation will be in numbers, but I backed into it, having done this sort of thing for many years, and I think it's going to be one new one for three old dollars.
[03:03:56.023 --> 03:03:59.826]  And I think that there will be a settlement between countries of debt
[03:04:00.915 --> 03:04:03.358]  And I think two-thirds of it will be written off.
[03:04:03.839 --> 03:04:11.547]  How this will affect the average person with the devaluation in the United States, I don't know.
[03:04:12.308 --> 03:04:20.437]  Logic would have us believe if you had a $100,000 loan and it was a devaluation by two-thirds, then your loan would be payable back at $32,500.
[03:04:23.507 --> 03:04:29.573]  Uh, but there's no logic in Washington, and there's no logic among the Illuminati.
[03:04:30.074 --> 03:04:31.095]  They do what they want to do.
[03:04:31.676 --> 03:04:34.118]  So, goodness knows what can happen.
[03:04:34.719 --> 03:04:36.281]  But, it does not look good.
[03:04:36.301 --> 03:04:39.825]  Uh, it could last another six months into
[03:04:41.350 --> 03:04:44.212]  2011 for this devaluation, but I think it's coming.
[03:04:44.732 --> 03:04:46.613]  I've written about it just recently.
[03:04:46.633 --> 03:04:48.074]  Well, Bob, stay there.
[03:04:48.335 --> 03:04:48.735]  Stay there.
[03:04:48.755 --> 03:04:55.440]  We're going to talk about the International Forecaster, how folks get a copy when we come back, and tell people what a devaluation will do to us economically.
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:58.622]  And if that isn't enough, a bunch of carbon taxes on top of it.
[03:04:58.862 --> 03:04:59.362]  The goal?
[03:04:59.743 --> 03:05:04.326]  Bankrupt the... This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:05:04.366 --> 03:05:07.169]  That produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:05:07.289 --> 03:05:09.251]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:05:09.392 --> 03:05:11.514]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:05:11.634 --> 03:05:13.156]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:04.262]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:04.582 --> 03:06:05.202]  Number one.
[03:06:05.502 --> 03:06:08.663]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:08.923 --> 03:06:09.503]  Number two.
[03:06:09.783 --> 03:06:14.325]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:14.665 --> 03:06:15.125]  It's true.
[03:06:15.425 --> 03:06:19.987]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:20.287 --> 03:06:20.847]  Number three.
[03:06:21.107 --> 03:06:24.409]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:24.689 --> 03:06:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:29.150]  Number 4.
[03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:31.772]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:32.173 --> 03:06:35.555]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:35.855 --> 03:06:36.375]  Number 5.
[03:06:36.636 --> 03:06:40.558]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:40.779 --> 03:06:45.542]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:08:00.754 --> 03:08:05.798]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.159 --> 03:08:08.480]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:10.963 --> 03:08:15.206]  We had Ron Paul on with us at the very start of the first hour.
[03:08:16.487 --> 03:08:17.688]  For a half hour.
[03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:23.953]  And he said that he had to go at 1230, 1130 Central to go vote.
[03:08:24.053 --> 03:08:26.896]  And he said he believed it would pass and that it was a strong bill.
[03:08:30.217 --> 03:08:32.638]  Sweeping bank reform bill clears house.
[03:08:32.798 --> 03:08:35.520]  Measure aimed at preventing another big financial crisis.
[03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:39.842]  Imposes more oversight and creates Consumer Protection Agency.
[03:08:40.382 --> 03:08:44.384]  And they hide in here that it has the provision to audit the Federal Reserve.
[03:08:44.424 --> 03:08:48.326]  They certainly don't want to trumpet that.
[03:08:48.606 --> 03:08:55.249]  Bob Chapman, comment on that and then what dollar devaluation will look like so people understand how serious it is.
[03:08:56.912 --> 03:09:03.739]  Well, it will inhibit the flow of business within a country or throughout the world.
[03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:06.261]  Less people will be employed.
[03:09:07.643 --> 03:09:19.154]  Real estate and other investments will probably, like they did during the Depression, get down anywhere between 60 and 95 percent and wouldn't recover until maybe we had another war.
[03:09:20.329 --> 03:09:21.529]  Maybe they'd never recover.
[03:09:23.490 --> 03:09:29.991]  The evaluation for America is going to be a staggering blow because we've lived better than anybody else in the world.
[03:09:30.771 --> 03:09:33.411]  And so that we get along, we get to go down.
[03:09:33.431 --> 03:09:39.853]  I mean, you go to a country, say, Mexico, they've had a lot of poverty, real poverty, for many years.
[03:09:39.913 --> 03:09:41.753]  So people have got used to living that way.
[03:09:42.353 --> 03:09:48.054]  And all the houses in Mexico, with minor exception, are paid for with cash.
[03:09:48.783 --> 03:09:51.545]  So, they don't have the downside that Americans do.
[03:09:51.945 --> 03:09:53.547]  It's true in many other countries as well.
[03:09:53.927 --> 03:09:56.829]  So, devaluation will be devastating.
[03:09:57.209 --> 03:09:58.270]  How do you protect yourself?
[03:09:58.510 --> 03:09:59.791]  There's only one way I know.
[03:10:00.392 --> 03:10:02.333]  And that's gold and silver related assets.
[03:10:02.714 --> 03:10:03.134]  Period.
[03:10:03.694 --> 03:10:04.595]  There is no other way.
[03:10:05.035 --> 03:10:06.977]  And if you're not doing it, you're fools.
[03:10:10.439 --> 03:10:11.120]  Continue, Bob.
[03:10:13.176 --> 03:10:28.921]  I think that the passage in the House, and we will pass the Senate, this bill, which is actually, the bill is monstrous except for the part about the auditing and investigation of the Fed.
[03:10:29.962 --> 03:10:35.044]  And I'm going to write about that for tomorrow's issue, right after we get off the program here.
[03:10:37.324 --> 03:10:42.206]  But anyway, it's a seminal event that this legislation included.
[03:10:43.231 --> 03:11:12.232]  The auditing of the Fed and the reason why I think it's a major turning point we get a pass to the Senate becomes law and immediately get the GAO in there and find out who the money's going to, why is it going to them, how are they using it, what are they paying for, what the collateral, how many foreign central banks, foreign entities of all kinds are receiving funds,
[03:11:12.890 --> 03:11:16.152]  Which is created out of thin air by the Federal Reserve.
[03:11:17.653 --> 03:11:19.795]  What are the assets of the Federal Reserve, really?
[03:11:20.775 --> 03:11:23.117]  And there's just a myriad of things.
[03:11:23.677 --> 03:11:25.378]  And we can do that within six months.
[03:11:26.199 --> 03:11:31.142]  And by the time the next election comes around, hopefully we can throw half the incumbents out of office.
[03:11:31.442 --> 03:11:32.863]  It doesn't matter what party they're in.
[03:11:34.044 --> 03:11:34.965]  We've got to get them out.
[03:11:35.725 --> 03:11:36.526]  They're on the take.
[03:11:36.806 --> 03:11:37.586]  They're getting paid.
[03:11:37.926 --> 03:11:38.687]  How do they get paid?
[03:11:39.147 --> 03:11:40.488]  Campaign contributions.
[03:11:41.129 --> 03:11:41.489]  By who?
[03:11:42.725 --> 03:11:52.050]  Wall Street, banking, insurance, transnational conglomerates, the pharmaceutical companies, etc.
[03:11:52.770 --> 03:11:54.211]  These are the big guns in there.
[03:11:54.591 --> 03:11:57.952]  And the people who are getting paid off by them, get them out of there.
[03:11:58.893 --> 03:12:01.114]  We might have a chance to make this happen.
[03:12:01.934 --> 03:12:05.176]  It's our only chance, legally through the system.
[03:12:08.758 --> 03:12:09.378]  Absolutely.
[03:12:09.398 --> 03:12:11.059]  You know, I look at the overall bill,
[03:12:12.541 --> 03:12:17.503]  Thank God Ron Paul got that one good part in there, but Obama's approving of it, so you know it's bad.
[03:12:17.523 --> 03:12:24.185]  It says, Obama administration expressed its approval of the House action.
[03:12:24.905 --> 03:12:34.389]  So, again, I wish I would have had more time, or I would have gotten to this earlier with Ron Paul to fully flesh it out.
[03:12:35.652 --> 03:12:46.937]  Because he was talking about how, well, they tried to strip the good provisions out in committee, but he got an amendment in to keep the strong Audit the Fed Bill part in.
[03:12:47.937 --> 03:12:58.501]  So I should have asked Ron Paul how he was even going to vote on this, because he'll vote against something that has something good in it, if it has something bad in it.
[03:12:58.561 --> 03:12:59.422]  But it did pass.
[03:12:59.502 --> 03:13:00.802]  I mean, that's quite a mystery.
[03:13:00.842 --> 03:13:03.123]  I'll have to find out here in the next few days.
[03:13:03.183 --> 03:13:05.044]  I wonder what the quickest way to find out is, Bob.
[03:13:06.226 --> 03:13:07.347]  Get on the phone and call him.
[03:13:11.490 --> 03:13:12.832]  That's a good idea.
[03:13:12.872 --> 03:13:19.357]  Guys, call... That's the best way, and just say, Ron, you know, what's the good parts, what's the bad parts?
[03:13:19.497 --> 03:13:20.718]  Obviously you voted for it.
[03:13:22.139 --> 03:13:27.564]  You know, it's just like the concept, your enemy's enemy is your friend.
[03:13:28.485 --> 03:13:29.585]  At least for the time being.
[03:13:30.666 --> 03:13:32.508]  And you gotta look at it that way, because
[03:13:33.667 --> 03:13:35.648]  We're desperate people doing desperate things.
[03:13:36.029 --> 03:13:39.111]  We're entrapped by an evil cabal.
[03:13:39.731 --> 03:13:41.713]  And we've got to do anything we can to get out of it.
[03:13:42.353 --> 03:13:43.694]  First, within the law.
[03:13:44.194 --> 03:13:47.236]  Later, if we can't do it that way, it'll be outside the law.
[03:13:48.217 --> 03:13:49.418]  And that's just the way things are.
[03:13:50.279 --> 03:13:52.500]  Okay, I do have it from CNN Money.
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:14:07.886]  Federal Reserve, the bill would allow Congress, so I was correct, to order the Government Accountability Office to audit the Fed activities, so now the audit goes forward if the Senate passes this, and they're set to pass it because they want the overall package.
[03:14:09.806 --> 03:14:14.008]  So, to audit the Fed does go forward, Bob Chapman.
[03:14:15.409 --> 03:14:18.950]  Well, again, it's a turning point in our history, a big one.
[03:14:20.098 --> 03:14:29.267]  And the doggedness and the will of Ron Paul over the last 20 years that made this happen.
[03:14:31.576 --> 03:14:34.617]  Two years ago, whether this was possible, and they say, you're crazy.
[03:14:35.357 --> 03:14:35.957]  And here we are.
[03:14:36.357 --> 03:14:37.497]  Let me expand on that, Bob.
[03:14:38.458 --> 03:14:40.258]  What is monstrous to you about the bill?
[03:14:40.298 --> 03:14:41.979]  It's obviously hundreds of pages long.
[03:14:42.719 --> 03:14:47.360]  The bailouts of AIG Bear Stearns would not be possible, made illegal under this bill.
[03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:51.701]  Representative Barney Frank, Chairman of the House Financial Committee, said Wednesday,
[03:14:52.541 --> 03:14:56.022]  As debate started on the bill, which again passed today on Friday.
[03:14:56.462 --> 03:14:58.943]  If a company fails, it will be put to death.
[03:14:59.944 --> 03:15:03.485]  But now, since the globalists have consolidated power, they want to be able to do that.
[03:15:04.885 --> 03:15:09.147]  Well, we don't know, I don't know what the final bill looks like.
[03:15:10.147 --> 03:15:11.848]  You know, you, neither do you.
[03:15:12.348 --> 03:15:17.110]  You're worried... Hey, will you guys pull up the House vote on the financial overhaul bill?
[03:15:18.170 --> 03:15:19.431]  And see what Paul's vote is?
[03:15:19.451 --> 03:15:20.271]  Because he said again,
[03:15:22.290 --> 03:15:25.331]  He was talking fast there at the end, and I wish I would have gotten to it earlier.
[03:15:25.371 --> 03:15:46.320]  He said, well we can probably just play the clip again, so we can have it actually from him, but he said, yeah I voted against it in committee because it was bad, but I got the amendment through to make it good, and he said so we will get the bill to audit the Fed, but then I wonder, because if he disagrees with any part of legislation, he won't go for it, just because his rider of auditing the Fed is now in there.
[03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:48.441]  I wonder if he voted for this.
[03:15:48.541 --> 03:15:53.185]  But regardless, Auditor of the Fed literally has gotten to third base right now.
[03:15:54.727 --> 03:15:56.148]  And we're going to get a home run on it.
[03:15:56.708 --> 03:16:00.572]  And we've got to start really leaning now that it's been passed.
[03:16:00.672 --> 03:16:04.195]  All of these co-sponsors, you've got to jump all over them.
[03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:07.971]  And say, we want the GAO to work as fast as possible.
[03:16:08.371 --> 03:16:09.971]  These are the things we need to know.
[03:16:10.572 --> 03:16:13.412]  And those things are, how is the money spent?
[03:16:13.733 --> 03:16:14.833]  How much was created?
[03:16:15.193 --> 03:16:17.033]  What has the Fed been doing in secret?
[03:16:17.414 --> 03:16:18.974]  Let's look at all their emails.
[03:16:19.334 --> 03:16:22.275]  Particularly the ones to other banks and to Wall Street.
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:25.001]  Who's been getting inside information?
[03:16:25.361 --> 03:16:26.602]  And believe me, they get it.
[03:16:27.362 --> 03:16:28.743]  Absolutely, insider trading.
[03:16:28.983 --> 03:16:40.389]  Let's play a short clip of Ron Paul and get your take on what he said, because this Washington stuff is very complex, and though I spend all my time researching it, we try to stay on top of the subtleties of the parliamentary procedure.
[03:16:40.449 --> 03:16:40.849]  Here it is.
[03:16:41.129 --> 03:16:43.090]  Auditing the Fed, give us a report on that.
[03:16:43.877 --> 03:16:51.523]  Okay, I think most know that last week it was put into a bank regulation bill, which is a monster of a bill.
[03:16:52.023 --> 03:16:57.487]  When it came out of the committee, I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good things when there's a lot of bad things in it.
[03:16:57.528 --> 03:17:02.691]  But my amendment won by 42 to 26, which was a major victory.
[03:17:03.032 --> 03:17:04.933]  It's on the House floor at this moment.
[03:17:05.053 --> 03:17:06.975]  It will be voted on at the end of the day.
[03:17:07.676 --> 03:17:08.317]  Unbelievable.
[03:17:16.963 --> 03:17:25.991]  The real work needs to be done in the Senate, so if anybody knows where their Senator stands, try to urge the Senators to get on that same bill.
[03:17:26.051 --> 03:17:30.254]  I think it's 604, and there's 30 in over there.
[03:17:30.314 --> 03:17:43.546]  There's been several Senators that have put a hold on Bernanke's reappointment, unless they have a vote on 1207, the auditing bill, in the Senate.
[03:17:44.068 --> 03:17:46.830]  So sir, this is a massive victory.
[03:17:47.010 --> 03:17:53.473]  I mean, today it looks like they're gonna probably pass it in the House, it'll go to the Senate, and then the fight's in the Senate.
[03:17:53.493 --> 03:17:54.754]  This is incredible news!
[03:17:55.509 --> 03:17:57.290]  Yeah, it's big.
[03:17:57.610 --> 03:18:00.451]  We have no idea, you know, exactly what will happen.
[03:18:00.471 --> 03:18:04.852]  There'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate, and the Fed still has time to do all that they do.
[03:18:05.373 --> 03:18:10.034]  But nevertheless, I think you're correct in describing this as a major victory for the people.
[03:18:11.275 --> 03:18:13.615]  I mean, the grassroots got this done.
[03:18:13.635 --> 03:18:15.136]  I didn't twist arms.
[03:18:15.196 --> 03:18:17.077]  I have no clout up here in that sense.
[03:18:18.772 --> 03:18:20.473]  Bob, I have the complete answer now.
[03:18:20.513 --> 03:18:32.361]  I had Ron Paul on earlier, but didn't ask him this question, though that sounded like he was saying he couldn't vote for his own bill, because overall the banking package was bad.
[03:18:32.982 --> 03:18:36.824]  Here is the Wall Street Journal, just out Q&A.
[03:18:36.904 --> 03:18:41.147]  Ron Paul explains why he can't vote for his own audit the Fed bill.
[03:18:42.228 --> 03:19:00.334]  And it says, author of the amendment to allow the government accountability audit monetary policy decisions made by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Paul said he is proud of the amendment, but would vote for the broader bill, but wouldn't vote for the broader bill to overhaul financial market rules because he objects to a number of his provisions.
[03:19:00.374 --> 03:19:01.875]  He spoke Friday to the Wall Street Journal.
[03:19:04.215 --> 03:19:07.176]  So he is for his amendment to audit the Fed.
[03:19:07.216 --> 03:19:08.717]  That's the only good thing in here.
[03:19:09.817 --> 03:19:13.120]  You got a little bit of punch in the turd bowl here.
[03:19:13.140 --> 03:19:15.301]  I'm sorry to use that horrible analogy.
[03:19:17.643 --> 03:19:21.626]  So he did vote against the bill, but it still passed.
[03:19:21.666 --> 03:19:25.409]  So the audit, the Fed bill, goes ahead now to the U.S.
[03:19:25.469 --> 03:19:25.789]  Senate.
[03:19:26.069 --> 03:19:29.532]  We need to make sure that provision stays in the U.S.
[03:19:29.592 --> 03:19:30.292]  Senate version.
[03:19:30.312 --> 03:19:31.173]  Correct, Bob Chapman?
[03:19:32.594 --> 03:19:32.814]  Right.
[03:19:33.254 --> 03:19:35.616]  We've got to get after the Senators, just like Ron said.
[03:19:36.274 --> 03:19:36.434]  I think?
[03:19:59.198 --> 03:20:00.900]  He voted, voted his conscience.
[03:20:00.940 --> 03:20:07.787]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:07.948 --> 03:20:09.890]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:12.132]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:20:12.272 --> 03:20:13.774]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:20:13.934 --> 03:20:18.219]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:20:18.379 --> 03:20:20.762]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:20:20.942 --> 03:20:26.750]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[03:20:26.970 --> 03:20:31.696]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:20:31.756 --> 03:20:34.499]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:20:34.599 --> 03:20:37.203]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:37.543 --> 03:20:37.883]  I think so.
[03:21:02.083 --> 03:21:05.728]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.109 --> 03:21:09.133]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.353 --> 03:21:10.775]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:11.477 --> 03:21:14.139]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.159 --> 03:21:20.384]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.544 --> 03:21:25.568]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.088 --> 03:21:35.716]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:35.836 --> 03:21:37.937]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.177 --> 03:21:39.518]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:39.778 --> 03:21:42.040]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:44.061]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.361 --> 03:21:49.144]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.505 --> 03:21:54.267]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:54.508 --> 03:21:58.610]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:01.368 --> 03:22:02.209]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:02.409 --> 03:22:07.754]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:07.934 --> 03:22:08.354]  I get it.
[03:22:08.474 --> 03:22:17.803]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.103 --> 03:22:19.284]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:19.504 --> 03:22:23.888]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:22:24.088 --> 03:22:25.789]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[03:22:25.929 --> 03:22:27.750]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[03:22:27.970 --> 03:22:31.252]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:31.353 --> 03:22:35.455]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:35.635 --> 03:22:37.196]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:37.236 --> 03:22:40.458]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:40.638 --> 03:22:44.821]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.001 --> 03:22:45.721]  You should, too.
[03:22:45.922 --> 03:22:46.882]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.062 --> 03:22:50.424]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:50.444 --> 03:22:50.484]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:54.948 --> 03:22:55.488]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:56.189 --> 03:22:58.390]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:58.470 --> 03:23:04.914]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:23:05.254 --> 03:23:09.337]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:23:09.597 --> 03:23:14.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:17.120]  I think?
[03:23:37.296 --> 03:23:41.197]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:23:41.437 --> 03:23:46.198]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:23:46.478 --> 03:23:50.519]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:23:50.660 --> 03:23:52.220]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:23:52.460 --> 03:23:57.041]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:24:04.045 --> 03:24:06.527]  We just talked to Rachel Mills, Press Secretary for Ron Paul.
[03:24:06.547 --> 03:24:15.335]  He did vote against the overall banking bill, but he shepherded the audit of the Fed bill, the amendment, through the House Banking Committee, into the bill.
[03:24:15.475 --> 03:24:16.576]  He's happy it passed.
[03:24:16.936 --> 03:24:18.638]  He's not happy the other provisions are in there.
[03:24:19.258 --> 03:24:20.339]  But it now goes to the Senate.
[03:24:20.359 --> 03:24:22.820]  We've got to make sure that doesn't get stripped out.
[03:24:23.241 --> 03:24:31.967]  I wanted to take a few final calls for Bob Chapman, then I'm going to run down all the latest Climategate, a bunch of other financial news that I haven't gotten to yet.
[03:24:32.747 --> 03:24:37.070]  But first, let's go to Greg in Hawaii, who's been patiently holding.
[03:24:37.130 --> 03:24:38.031]  Greg, you're on the air.
[03:24:38.051 --> 03:24:39.672]  Woo!
[03:24:40.032 --> 03:24:41.533]  Praise the Lord!
[03:24:41.573 --> 03:24:43.074]  Pass the ammunition!
[03:24:43.514 --> 03:24:44.395]  Okay, buddy, go ahead.
[03:24:45.433 --> 03:24:48.395]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:24:48.736 --> 03:24:50.097]  I've got a couple quick questions.
[03:24:50.157 --> 03:24:52.518]  Yeah, they've got to be quick, because your phone's really bad.
[03:24:53.719 --> 03:24:55.561]  Alright, let me get off the speakerphone here.
[03:24:55.781 --> 03:24:56.281]  Is that better?
[03:24:56.642 --> 03:24:57.342]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[03:24:58.203 --> 03:25:04.347]  Alright, how do you wake up a girlfriend that works for Big Pharma, is one question.
[03:25:04.868 --> 03:25:07.190]  And another question is, what size of shirt do you wear?
[03:25:07.210 --> 03:25:08.931]  I want to send you a shirt I made for Christmas.
[03:25:09.915 --> 03:25:17.078]  Okay, well, number one, my wife, when she was my girlfriend, didn't really entirely believe everything I was talking about.
[03:25:17.498 --> 03:25:19.119]  And I said, that's great, honey.
[03:25:19.139 --> 03:25:22.160]  I like you and like the way you look and everything else.
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:24.141]  And I like your personality.
[03:25:24.721 --> 03:25:26.141]  You don't have to believe what I believe.
[03:25:27.978 --> 03:25:31.162]  After a year or two of being around me, she was like, my God, this stuff's all real.
[03:25:31.182 --> 03:25:41.476]  She'd see me there reading the papers, the documents, and then we got married and she knows as much as I do about this and is more freaked out than I am and can't believe the public isn't waking up.
[03:25:41.576 --> 03:25:42.818]  So I wouldn't hard sell her.
[03:25:43.759 --> 03:25:50.482]  Uh, you could bring her, you know, the CBS News article where they put live polio virus in the polio vaccine, killing a bunch of people.
[03:25:50.982 --> 03:25:53.363]  You could bring her the Tuskegee Experiment information.
[03:25:53.403 --> 03:25:58.124]  You could bring her Project Shad, where our own government nerve-gassed our troops to death and did tests on them.
[03:25:58.424 --> 03:25:59.485]  Did the same thing in England.
[03:26:00.265 --> 03:26:10.991]  You can bring her the actual insert of the vaccines where it says the H1N1 has mercury, can cause cancer, can sterilize you, and say, well then why is the news saying this is just fine?
[03:26:11.571 --> 03:26:13.712]  And, you know, just make it fun!
[03:26:14.373 --> 03:26:20.336]  And a lot of yuppies and people, if you really want to wake her up, they go off of feeling trendy.
[03:26:21.076 --> 03:26:30.119]  So, you know, just kind of laugh with her, not at her, and say, okay, you know, you think 20% of the public on serotonin reuptake inhibitors is great.
[03:26:31.740 --> 03:26:32.921]  You think all this is wonderful.
[03:26:33.161 --> 03:26:34.561]  Hey, here's articles right here.
[03:26:34.861 --> 03:26:38.122]  Here's the insert for Prozac admitting it can make you commit suicide.
[03:26:38.683 --> 03:26:42.124]  Oh, here's articles where they suppress that in their trials in 1980-81.
[03:26:42.184 --> 03:26:46.165]  I mean, instead of arguing with her, just give her a pile of documents.
[03:26:46.205 --> 03:26:46.746]  Bob Chapman.
[03:26:48.026 --> 03:26:50.067]  There's nothing, no other way to do it.
[03:26:50.675 --> 03:26:53.998]  And of course, there's Alex's site and there's the International Forecaster.
[03:26:54.659 --> 03:27:00.344]  And over a period of time, as long as she's willing to listen, it'll all open up.
[03:27:01.765 --> 03:27:02.846]  Thank you very much, gentlemen.
[03:27:03.126 --> 03:27:03.927]  What about chemtrails?
[03:27:03.947 --> 03:27:07.330]  Because about a month ago, I saw a gray plane flying about 4,000 feet.
[03:27:10.554 --> 03:27:23.840]  Well, the White House science czar has now admitted there's been a long-term secret weather modification project they call geoengineering or terraforming going on and yes, there is a lot of atmospheric manipulation and I wear a large
[03:27:24.733 --> 03:27:30.415]  Okay, I went from an extra large to a large, but if I don't get back on my diet, I'll go back to an extra large, but I wear a large t-shirt.
[03:27:30.815 --> 03:27:31.676]  Thank you very much, sir.
[03:27:31.696 --> 03:27:32.556]  I appreciate the call.
[03:27:32.956 --> 03:27:34.577]  Another call for Bob Chapman here.
[03:27:34.957 --> 03:27:36.517]  William in Tennessee.
[03:27:36.557 --> 03:27:37.178]  You're on the air.
[03:27:37.238 --> 03:27:37.878]  Go ahead, William.
[03:27:38.338 --> 03:27:41.599]  Greetings and salutations from the FEMA-controlled state of Tennessee.
[03:27:41.959 --> 03:27:42.240]  Yes.
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:43.640]  How are you doing today?
[03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:48.022]  Yes, for those who don't know, you have official Army checkpoints in Tennessee.
[03:27:48.042 --> 03:27:50.162]  The governor says don't do it, but they just continue them.
[03:27:50.663 --> 03:27:51.363]  It's everywhere.
[03:27:52.063 --> 03:27:54.144]  It's really intimidating to try to go anywhere in public.
[03:27:55.313 --> 03:27:56.834]  I just had a really quick question for you.
[03:27:57.794 --> 03:28:09.858]  Which of your documentaries best describes the Eugenics Project and its overreaching, overarching end result?
[03:28:10.558 --> 03:28:14.319]  End game, end game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:28:14.639 --> 03:28:15.560]  This film right here.
[03:28:15.580 --> 03:28:18.001]  End game.
[03:28:18.581 --> 03:28:20.261]  Why they would want us to all perish.
[03:28:20.441 --> 03:28:21.862]  I mean, they need slaves, right?
[03:28:22.526 --> 03:28:23.727]  No, they don't want us to all perish.
[03:28:23.767 --> 03:28:29.231]  They want, on average, different documents, say different numbers, 250 to 350 million people.
[03:28:29.591 --> 03:28:36.576]  Bob Chapman, explain to our friends that this is a parasitic banking system that creates fiat money to buy the world.
[03:28:36.636 --> 03:28:37.496]  They don't need us.
[03:28:37.536 --> 03:28:38.197]  They don't want us.
[03:28:38.537 --> 03:28:39.277]  Explain that, Bob.
[03:28:40.778 --> 03:28:45.121]  Well, to take it one step further, then they don't need as many people.
[03:28:45.482 --> 03:28:48.924]  And they're interested in the longevity of the planet.
[03:28:49.728 --> 03:28:59.392]  They're also, as Alex said earlier, if you were listening, they have ways of extending life now 150 to 200 years and it'll grow in time.
[03:29:00.253 --> 03:29:02.513]  And they don't want to give that to everybody.
[03:29:02.533 --> 03:29:12.738]  They just want these slaves to be able to evolve for the time that they naturally are living today, which would be in the 80s.
[03:29:13.398 --> 03:29:15.539]  And then if people learn
[03:29:16.275 --> 03:29:19.456]  About what they're doing, well, they'll naturally die or be put to death.
[03:29:20.217 --> 03:29:25.399]  And so, that's the, you might call it, the world that they want to create for us.
[03:29:26.159 --> 03:29:30.741]  Bob Chapman, fire out the toll-free number if folks want a complimentary copy of the International Forecaster.
[03:29:32.422 --> 03:29:36.704]  That number is, and I don't have it in front of me, here it is, 877-479-8000.
[03:29:41.103 --> 03:29:45.205]  8178, toll free, 877-479-8178.
[03:29:46.185 --> 03:29:48.446]  Or theinternationalforecaster.com.
[03:29:48.766 --> 03:29:49.506]  Get one online.
[03:29:49.546 --> 03:29:50.066]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:29:50.086 --> 03:29:50.747]  See you next week.
[03:29:51.027 --> 03:29:51.947]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.427 --> 03:29:54.028]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.948 --> 03:29:57.629]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.267 --> 03:30:05.888]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:06.228 --> 03:30:14.349]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:30:15.089 --> 03:30:19.130]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:30:19.710 --> 03:30:30.532]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:30:31.172 --> 03:30:40.175]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:40.675 --> 03:30:45.717]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:30:46.097 --> 03:30:53.280]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:30:53.600 --> 03:30:56.001]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:31:01.471 --> 03:31:05.115]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:05.135 --> 03:31:08.519]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:08.739 --> 03:31:13.524]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:31:13.544 --> 03:31:19.791]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:19.931 --> 03:31:22.174]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:31:22.694 --> 03:31:22.994]  Tim Geithner?
[03:31:23.014 --> 03:31:23.435]  Bernanke?
[03:31:23.515 --> 03:31:24.135]  They're arsonists!
[03:31:24.175 --> 03:31:24.836]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:24.856 --> 03:31:26.977]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:41.607 --> 03:31:48.530]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[03:32:00.697 --> 03:32:03.300]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:03.700 --> 03:32:08.665]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:09.025 --> 03:32:10.767]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:11.087 --> 03:32:15.892]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:16.092 --> 03:32:16.993]  How much do you want?
[03:32:17.253 --> 03:32:17.994]  When do you want it?
[03:32:18.374 --> 03:32:19.975]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:32:20.255 --> 03:32:21.096]  When will you need it?
[03:32:21.336 --> 03:32:23.417]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:32:23.537 --> 03:32:24.638]  Will there be any food?
[03:32:24.878 --> 03:32:26.219]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:32:26.399 --> 03:32:31.483]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:32:31.683 --> 03:32:34.865]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:32:35.265 --> 03:32:38.728]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:32:39.068 --> 03:32:40.049]  How much will you need?
[03:32:40.289 --> 03:32:40.929]  We don't know.
[03:32:41.190 --> 03:32:42.110]  How much do you want?
[03:32:42.310 --> 03:32:43.051]  All you can get.
[03:32:43.231 --> 03:32:44.092]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:32:44.332 --> 03:32:47.094]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:32:47.374 --> 03:32:49.135]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:49.155 --> 03:32:50.076]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:33:09.369 --> 03:33:35.691]  Spout it down, load it up and truck it We're gonna do what they say can't be done We've got a long way to go And a short time to get there I mean, spout just like no bandit run Keep your foot hard on the pedal Some hell of a mind it breaks Let it all hang out cause we got a run to make The boys up there stickin' Atlanta And there's beer in Texarkana
[03:33:39.594 --> 03:33:46.516]  Okay my friends, I'm going to take some of your phone calls, run over some of the news we haven't covered, recap some of the most important top stories.
[03:33:46.536 --> 03:33:54.778]  And I know this information is hard to believe that we cover here.
[03:33:55.498 --> 03:33:57.939]  I got a Texas Monthly reporter out there, good old Nate.
[03:33:58.479 --> 03:34:04.261]  He wrote a great story about Tulia, Texas and the police and informants planting drugs on people to put them in prison.
[03:34:05.201 --> 03:34:08.942]  But he heard Bob Chapman talk about the elite believing they can extend their lifespans.
[03:34:10.097 --> 03:34:14.022]  And he said, do you ever stop people when they're saying something that's outlandish?
[03:34:14.442 --> 03:34:15.544]  That's not outlandish.
[03:34:17.366 --> 03:34:19.809]  That's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:34:21.286 --> 03:34:27.347]  Ray Kurzweil, Bill Joy, countless others, they believe this is happening.
[03:34:27.407 --> 03:34:35.689]  They believe that they need to get rid of the general population, reduce the world's numbers, so that the select few can have access to this.
[03:34:35.729 --> 03:34:40.150]  Now, whether it's real, or whether they're going to be able to develop it, that remains to be seen.
[03:34:41.571 --> 03:34:45.572]  But they've already doubled the lifespans of rats by special diets.
[03:34:46.112 --> 03:34:50.553]  They've doubled the lifespans of different worms with special diets, and that's only one area.
[03:34:51.966 --> 03:34:54.066]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[03:34:54.166 --> 03:34:55.247]  I don't know if that's real.
[03:34:55.987 --> 03:34:58.327]  I know the studies are real, but I don't know if they can do this with humans.
[03:34:59.548 --> 03:35:01.488]  Studies show it's similar effects with humans.
[03:35:02.648 --> 03:35:03.628]  A lot of it's genetic.
[03:35:03.968 --> 03:35:06.789]  They have all these new genetic treatments, nanotech.
[03:35:07.629 --> 03:35:15.851]  But, you know, when I sit here and talk about China calling for a global one-child policy,
[03:35:17.398 --> 03:35:29.683]  I have the China Daily, the big official government newspaper here, population control called key, and the government official, a member of the Chinese government delegation, called for a global one-child policy.
[03:35:31.944 --> 03:35:32.664]  Here's another one.
[03:35:32.964 --> 03:35:36.545]  The real inconvenient truth, the National Post of Canada.
[03:35:38.146 --> 03:35:40.787]  I mean, just Google one-child policy.
[03:35:42.901 --> 03:35:46.964]  And click it, and yesterday I did it and several hundred new articles came up.
[03:35:47.244 --> 03:35:49.285]  Not Google Web, Google News.
[03:35:49.465 --> 03:35:50.566]  Only the last seven days.
[03:35:51.026 --> 03:35:52.527]  Let's do it right now for the news reporter.
[03:35:53.127 --> 03:35:58.871]  Let's go to Google right now, and let's together, because this is real.
[03:35:59.451 --> 03:36:01.633]  This is being proposed right now in Copenhagen.
[03:36:03.674 --> 03:36:06.836]  Let's go to the search engine and type in one child policy.
[03:36:08.368 --> 03:36:10.689]  One Child Policy.
[03:36:10.709 --> 03:36:14.230]  There it is on TV screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:36:14.831 --> 03:36:17.172]  And let's click a news search.
[03:36:18.572 --> 03:36:20.113]  And we put it on the screen over here so I can see it.
[03:36:20.153 --> 03:36:20.453]  Thank you.
[03:36:23.094 --> 03:36:24.495]  I can try to read it from over there.
[03:36:24.955 --> 03:36:29.557]  How many articles does it say in the last seven days?
[03:36:29.617 --> 03:36:31.417]  It'll be at the bottom of the top block.
[03:36:32.458 --> 03:36:35.419]  It says, how many other news?
[03:36:35.599 --> 03:36:37.780]  See the green link right there on the first block?
[03:36:39.534 --> 03:36:41.174]  How many other news stories does that say?
[03:36:42.755 --> 03:36:43.295]  All 35.
[03:36:44.255 --> 03:36:46.836]  And if you count up the other blocks, it was several hundred yesterday.
[03:36:47.036 --> 03:36:48.716]  But I mean, just read the top link right there.
[03:36:49.156 --> 03:36:49.936]  Read the top link.
[03:36:50.496 --> 03:36:54.317]  Beijing tells world to fight climate change through one-child policy.
[03:36:54.657 --> 03:36:56.497]  And the United Nations has proposed this.
[03:36:56.898 --> 03:37:00.598]  The White House science czar, John P. Holdren, has proposed this.
[03:37:00.718 --> 03:37:03.499]  And drugging your water supply to sterilize you.
[03:37:04.759 --> 03:37:08.400]  And creating a global earth religion to enforce it.
[03:37:10.009 --> 03:37:10.349]  Okay?
[03:37:11.029 --> 03:37:13.790]  Now, let me read to you from the National Post.
[03:37:15.571 --> 03:37:20.692]  The real inconvenient truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[03:37:22.113 --> 03:37:28.135]  A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the global birth rate currently.
[03:37:29.215 --> 03:37:29.515]  Okay?
[03:37:29.835 --> 03:37:33.096]  Now, what did Dr. Eric Pionka at UT call for?
[03:37:33.116 --> 03:37:37.398]  He said a Chinese global police state, modeled after the Chinese,
[03:37:38.717 --> 03:37:40.497]  With forced abortion, all of it.
[03:37:40.697 --> 03:37:43.338]  This is what is in the UN documents.
[03:37:43.818 --> 03:37:47.999]  This is what is being set up right now.
[03:37:48.179 --> 03:37:54.540]  Now, what else is in the documents?
[03:37:58.520 --> 03:38:01.781]  What else is going on with all of this?
[03:38:03.141 --> 03:38:07.362]  We have the Copenhagen Climate Summit and Disarray after Danish techs leak.
[03:38:08.536 --> 03:38:18.422]  And this is from the London Guardian, and you click the first link and you can read the secret treaty, an addendum to the public treaty that they plan to try to pass next week.
[03:38:18.442 --> 03:38:19.102]  This is confirmed.
[03:38:19.743 --> 03:38:25.686]  And it says, the UN will have no power, the IMF and World Bank will run it and levy global taxes on everyone on the planet.
[03:38:28.128 --> 03:38:37.754]  And Maury Strong, the head of the UN Environment Initiative states, we must destroy the United States in global industrial capacity
[03:38:39.039 --> 03:39:05.007]  to force population reduction let me read to you what people again i spent thirty minutes or so this morning just reading the comments in the national post article and i had to stop there were hundreds but in thirty minutes of reading speed reading i did not find one
[03:39:06.232 --> 03:39:09.214]  comment agreeing with the author of this article.
[03:39:10.095 --> 03:39:10.835]  But they don't care.
[03:39:12.076 --> 03:39:13.337]  They're still going to try to implement it.
[03:39:15.058 --> 03:39:19.501]  Let me read to you some of the comments that I printed off from this.
[03:39:20.001 --> 03:39:20.401]  Wow!
[03:39:21.182 --> 03:39:22.322]  This has been tried before.
[03:39:22.422 --> 03:39:30.007]  Stalin was the master of the trick, starve the people and they will do whatever we want.
[03:39:30.027 --> 03:39:31.908]  That's from Jay Bird.
[03:39:32.689 --> 03:39:35.571]  There's Boza Boy or Bonza Boy.
[03:39:38.612 --> 03:39:44.814]  This is a tough measure to sell because we've got used to levels of consumption that is not going to be easy to move away from.
[03:39:44.894 --> 03:39:50.957]  Government can extort, influence, and educate, but it's going to take change from consumers, retailers, and producers.
[03:39:53.138 --> 03:40:02.881]  Poor, in instance, means I have a good quality of life, but means I must constantly work to pay bills, and I have little chance of changing my lifestyle considerably without it costing me.
[03:40:03.202 --> 03:40:03.722]  I can afford.
[03:40:04.102 --> 03:40:06.443]  Most people in developed countries live like this.
[03:40:09.687 --> 03:40:10.608]  There's another comment.
[03:40:14.110 --> 03:40:21.935]  You know, what happened this morning is when I was reading this, there were hundreds of comments and now that they printed it when I got to the office, there's actually a few here supporting it now.
[03:40:22.956 --> 03:40:25.137]  Oh, because it's saying this comment's been removed by moderator.
[03:40:25.578 --> 03:40:28.760]  See, what happened is I was at my, uh, here's a little conspiracy right here.
[03:40:29.020 --> 03:40:37.806]  I was at my house reading comment after comment, everyone's saying, you're a Nazi, you want Malthusian eugenics, and now they're just removing it all because we printed this once I got to the office.
[03:40:38.541 --> 03:40:39.242]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:40:39.502 --> 03:40:42.665]  I said, print those off so I can read them, and now they're removed by the moderator.
[03:40:49.931 --> 03:40:53.655]  Says, does the Mobile Organ Bank come with a laugh track?
[03:40:53.755 --> 03:40:54.816]  Because that's what they have in China.
[03:40:55.765 --> 03:40:57.466]  They have mobile execution vans.
[03:40:57.586 --> 03:40:58.947]  Oh, the reporter won't believe that.
[03:40:59.308 --> 03:41:01.629]  Google mobile execution vans in China.
[03:41:01.649 --> 03:41:02.750]  I want to show him those.
[03:41:03.351 --> 03:41:06.153]  Does the Mobile Organ Bank come with a track, a lap track?
[03:41:06.413 --> 03:41:07.354]  I'll check back later.
[03:41:07.614 --> 03:41:11.497]  I'm just on my way to pick up a few steaks and a half gallon of milk for the supper.
[03:41:12.097 --> 03:41:13.878]  And maybe a block of nice cheddar cheese.
[03:41:13.918 --> 03:41:15.159]  This article made me hungry.
[03:41:15.720 --> 03:41:19.262]  And see, that's because it's all over the news now that we shouldn't be able to eat meat and cheese.
[03:41:19.603 --> 03:41:24.106]  It has a big carbon footprint because the flatulence of cows is going to kill the universe.
[03:41:30.382 --> 03:41:31.343]  I'm a vegetarian.
[03:41:31.363 --> 03:41:37.787]  These bloody lunatic AGWs are making me think about taking up meat eating after twenty years of abstinence.
[03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:44.352]  And again, more moderator removed.
[03:41:44.392 --> 03:41:45.913]  The comments I was reading have been removed.
[03:41:48.275 --> 03:41:51.077]  Lies, lies and man-made climate change.
[03:41:51.557 --> 03:41:55.360]  The statist left who would steal our liberties and hysterically with his nonsense.
[03:41:55.400 --> 03:41:56.761]  How can anyone believe them anymore?
[03:41:57.241 --> 03:41:58.022]  Their lies would
[03:41:59.284 --> 03:42:00.965]  Not make good science fiction.
[03:42:01.946 --> 03:42:03.307]  Would even make good science fiction.
[03:42:03.607 --> 03:42:06.309]  Kill all our pets because they eat, breathe, and poop.
[03:42:06.789 --> 03:42:09.031]  Actually, they're calling for taxes on all dogs.
[03:42:09.411 --> 03:42:10.712]  Did you find the mobile execution vans?
[03:42:11.692 --> 03:42:13.874]  I want to show him Times of London, Associated Press.
[03:42:14.754 --> 03:42:14.875]  Oh!
[03:42:15.255 --> 03:42:16.095]  That's USA Today.
[03:42:16.175 --> 03:42:17.897]  China makes ultimate punishment mobile.
[03:42:20.198 --> 03:42:20.819]  Continuing.
[03:42:25.163 --> 03:42:26.124]  Staples are over this.
[03:42:26.164 --> 03:42:27.145]  Let me pull it off so I can read it.
[03:42:27.525 --> 03:42:29.627]  Others say we should look to population control.
[03:42:29.928 --> 03:42:31.489]  A few suggest wars of genocide.
[03:42:31.789 --> 03:42:36.093]  Many, many others would prefer to pretend that numbers do not mean anything and we should just carry on.
[03:42:37.455 --> 03:42:40.157]  Tim Lang isn't the first to suggest we should tighten our belts.
[03:42:40.217 --> 03:42:43.941]  My priority this year is to secure some land so I can grow my own veggies.
[03:42:44.421 --> 03:42:45.923]  Oh, they're trying to restrict that under these laws.
[03:42:45.943 --> 03:42:48.745]  I already have seed, so there's somebody that likes it.
[03:42:49.713 --> 03:42:51.294]  And Henry Kissinger calls for wars.
[03:42:51.634 --> 03:42:52.835]  Stage wars and famine.
[03:42:53.496 --> 03:42:55.477]  And State Department memorandum 200.
[03:42:55.717 --> 03:43:00.041]  And you can go through these comments.
[03:43:00.061 --> 03:43:03.463]  When I read this this morning, there wasn't one comment in support.
[03:43:03.763 --> 03:43:08.627]  Now there are a few here, and moderators removed the people as fast as they can.
[03:43:08.647 --> 03:43:13.290]  This is unbelievable.
[03:43:13.370 --> 03:43:16.152]  Chinese-style one-child policy.
[03:43:17.628 --> 03:43:29.953]  We have gone from saying the Chinese are bad with forced abortion and infanticide and imprisoning people that have more than one child to, oh yes, we've got to have it in China that owns the majority of our debt.
[03:43:30.333 --> 03:43:34.455]  They're saying that we have to have one-child policies in the West.
[03:43:36.876 --> 03:43:42.038]  And of course, inside of the Copenhagen Global Government Treaty,
[03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:54.023]  They say that the third world has to make right at double the cuts the West does when they're right at subsistence level because the evil humans are exhaling carbon dioxide.
[03:43:56.003 --> 03:44:01.365]  15 plus million people starved to death, an additional 10 million starved to death in 2008 because of ethanol.
[03:44:01.725 --> 03:44:13.048]  One third of U.S., Brazilian and other food production being taken out to grow corn and other things that are turned into ethanol for cars.
[03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:14.709]  Just absolute bull.
[03:44:18.513 --> 03:44:21.759]  Here's George Soros, KeyPrisonPlanet.com article.
[03:44:22.240 --> 03:44:23.603]  Climate colonialism.
[03:44:23.683 --> 03:44:26.768]  Soros wants poorer nations to take on green debt.
[03:44:26.909 --> 03:44:28.452]  That's what's in the new treaty.
[03:44:30.020 --> 03:44:34.544]  Suggest more crippling IMF loans to third world in the name of saving the planet.
[03:44:34.824 --> 03:44:48.657]  Billionaire George Soros has suggested that poor nations be persuaded to take on what he describes as green loans in the name of combating climate change, a policy that would land the already crippled poor third world with even more debt payable to globalist institutions such as the IMF.
[03:44:50.038 --> 03:44:52.541]  Speaking yesterday at the Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen,
[03:44:53.689 --> 03:45:00.641]  The financier said that $100 billion should be provided in loans to poorer nations to help slowing global warming.
[03:45:00.921 --> 03:45:02.945]  Loans taken from the West in carbon tax.
[03:45:03.925 --> 03:45:13.188]  The proposal would entail third world countries paying back interest to governments of the richer nations to stem a perceived crisis that they had little or no direct involvement in manufacturing.
[03:45:13.688 --> 03:45:20.971]  Soros said the loans could be backed by special drawing rights, a synthetic international currency issued by the International Monetary Fund.
[03:45:21.611 --> 03:45:22.851]  And that's the new global currency.
[03:45:22.871 --> 03:45:24.052]  Do you understand?
[03:45:25.072 --> 03:45:39.057]  A private IMF World Bank consortium will tax you and set up a World Transportation Authority to tax aircraft, ships, Law of the Sea Treaty, Times of London Today, 400 years of freedom on the seas are over.
[03:45:39.557 --> 03:45:43.719]  You watch the video on the site, they're saying they're going to restrict you eating meat.
[03:45:45.920 --> 03:45:46.880]  It gets worse though.
[03:45:47.340 --> 03:45:49.181]  Here's the Wall Street Journal today.
[03:45:49.861 --> 03:45:52.262]  I pledge allegiance to global warming.
[03:45:54.525 --> 03:45:59.168]  British scientists caught faking science data and hiding the decline.
[03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:01.930]  Sign a government loyalty oath.
[03:46:01.970 --> 03:46:08.515]  They've gone around saying you have to sign a government loyalty oath confirming that you believe climate change is man-made.
[03:46:09.216 --> 03:46:13.439]  The Met Office, Britain's national weather service, has embarked on an urgent exercise
[03:46:14.059 --> 03:46:28.176]  To bolster the reputation of the climate change science in the wake of the whistleblower revelation of widespread misconduct by climate scientists, the London Times reports, more than 1,700 scientists have agreed to sign a statement defending the professional integrity of global warming research.
[03:46:28.657 --> 03:46:29.037]  They are...
[03:46:29.838 --> 03:46:35.421]  Responding to a round-robin request by the Met Office, which has spent four days collecting signatures.
[03:46:35.541 --> 03:46:38.002]  One scientist told the Times he felt under pressure to sign.
[03:46:38.382 --> 03:46:47.107]  The Met Office, and a major employer of scientists, has long had a policy of only appointing and working with those who subscribe to their views on man-made global warming.
[03:46:47.127 --> 03:46:51.109]  Yeah, you can't get a climate grant from government or big corporations or big oil.
[03:46:51.289 --> 03:46:55.151]  They're the main ones funding this fraud, when the media says they're actually against it.
[03:46:56.075 --> 03:46:59.977]  The concept of scientists or journalists or artists signing a petition is ludicrous.
[03:47:00.337 --> 03:47:04.519]  The idea that they are lending their authority to whatever cause the petition represents.
[03:47:04.919 --> 03:47:09.521]  But in fact, they are undermining the authority which is based on the presumption that they think for themselves.
[03:47:10.442 --> 03:47:11.142]  Absolutely.
[03:47:14.504 --> 03:47:15.264]  Oh my gosh.
[03:47:15.604 --> 03:47:19.046]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[03:47:19.306 --> 03:47:21.067]  In fact, here are the deleted comments.
[03:47:21.147 --> 03:47:23.588]  I actually did print some of these at my house this morning.
[03:47:26.451 --> 03:47:31.976]  And it goes on to say, you make me ashamed of living in Canada.
[03:47:32.016 --> 03:47:33.098]  This is to the National Post.
[03:47:33.418 --> 03:47:36.381]  If you're first born, it's too bad your mother had you.
[03:47:36.401 --> 03:47:39.604]  If you're not, she would have started with you.
[03:47:39.924 --> 03:47:42.126]  You are a heartless, dirty woman and a shame on you.
[03:47:42.246 --> 03:47:46.551]  Ask the Chinese people who fled their country and came to Canada and the U.S.
[03:47:46.591 --> 03:47:48.152]  exactly where they are here.
[03:47:49.053 --> 03:47:50.174]  Hang your head in shame.
[03:47:50.214 --> 03:48:00.225]  This is Malthusian junk science, is still proposed from time to time, speaks of the fact that some in academia just refuse to learn from empirical evidence.
[03:48:01.086 --> 03:48:03.069]  And now it's slipped into journalism.
[03:48:03.409 --> 03:48:05.752]  The management of the Financial Post should be quite embarrassed.
[03:48:06.232 --> 03:48:06.572]  I just...
[03:48:07.719 --> 03:48:10.620]  Stick to the Wall Street Journal and do not bother coming back here anymore.
[03:48:10.640 --> 03:48:16.363]  An editorial board that thinks this is worthy of publication couldn't possibly know how to edit a newspaper or website.
[03:48:16.923 --> 03:48:20.185]  Those who believe in global warming, one child may be a solution.
[03:48:20.505 --> 03:48:25.167]  Here in Iowa, USA, you may find a lot of folks who believe in global cooling.
[03:48:25.507 --> 03:48:27.568]  For us in the USA, it would be the opposite.
[03:48:28.396 --> 03:48:35.903]  We need as many babies as possible to grow up and work to pay for the rapidly disappearing Social Security and Medicare system.
[03:48:35.923 --> 03:48:42.208]  See, I am some of the first comments I saw of Paul Watson to put in an article, and then they removed him off the newspaper.
[03:48:44.490 --> 03:48:45.110]  Here's some more.
[03:48:46.286 --> 03:48:46.746]  I knew it!
[03:48:46.806 --> 03:48:47.987]  According to Wikipedia, Ms.
[03:48:48.027 --> 03:48:49.908]  Francis is married with two children.
[03:48:50.169 --> 03:48:51.069]  Typical liberal.
[03:48:51.089 --> 03:48:52.910]  They're not liberal folks, they're eugenicists.
[03:48:53.271 --> 03:48:55.432]  Telling others how to live while not doing it yourselves.
[03:48:55.472 --> 03:48:58.194]  Like Ted Turner has five kids but says you shouldn't be able to have any.
[03:48:58.214 --> 03:48:59.215]  Or paying for it either.
[03:48:59.975 --> 03:49:00.736]  Audit this fool!
[03:49:01.576 --> 03:49:03.197]  This reporter is a complete nut job.
[03:49:03.257 --> 03:49:06.998]  I can't believe anyone in a North American country would actually believe in this legitimate idea.
[03:49:07.278 --> 03:49:09.779]  And by the way, China's policy has had major consequences.
[03:49:10.079 --> 03:49:11.879]  Many girl babies were aborted and killed.
[03:49:12.139 --> 03:49:16.721]  And due to the scarcity of Chinese women, Chinese men are paying through the nose to obtain bribes.
[03:49:17.001 --> 03:49:24.163]  Therefore, lives are unfulfilled and the Chinese population decreases much further than any they ever desired.
[03:49:25.624 --> 03:49:26.124]  Who does this
[03:49:27.264 --> 03:49:28.304]  The person thinks she is.
[03:49:29.005 --> 03:49:32.486]  Why doesn't she do everyone a favor and start thinning the herd by killing herself?
[03:49:34.866 --> 03:49:37.827]  It's hard to believe that this opinionated rant is called journalism.
[03:49:37.947 --> 03:49:40.588]  I saw no evidence of journalistic balance, fairness, or objectivity.
[03:49:40.628 --> 03:49:55.533]  She made no mention of the grave problems caused by the one-child policy in China, including forced abortions, sterilizations, heavy fines, disparate sex ratio, and fantasy on females, increased in mental health problems, including Chinese women's suicide rates.
[03:49:56.923 --> 03:49:59.384]  Thank God I saved those before they went down the memory hole.
[03:50:02.666 --> 03:50:03.487]  I mean, it's incredible!
[03:50:04.147 --> 03:50:07.669]  I come into the office, I go, print the comments from that, every comment's against them.
[03:50:07.989 --> 03:50:15.613]  And then they print it, and all the comments against her are deleted, and I guarantee you the newspaper's there under dummy accounts, going, oh yes, I love your article!
[03:50:15.833 --> 03:50:16.654]  It's so wonderful!
[03:50:16.834 --> 03:50:17.895]  Let's kill everyone!
[03:50:20.916 --> 03:50:23.218]  All these years they said there was no world government.
[03:50:23.638 --> 03:50:25.499]  All these years they said we were kooks.
[03:50:26.684 --> 03:50:33.007]  And then now, they openly call for a planetary regime to force one-child policies on everyone.
[03:50:36.209 --> 03:50:38.550]  Oh, man, I'll take a few final calls in the final segment.
[03:50:38.590 --> 03:50:40.891]  What an incredible week back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:50:40.931 --> 03:50:42.772]  Central with the abbreviated Sunday Transmission.
[03:50:44.537 --> 03:51:00.280]  Get angry, get focused, get aggressive, start getting in these people's faces, let them know that we're fully aware that eugenics sprung out of England and the U.S., was picked up by Hitler, and that these control freaks want a planetary dictatorship to cull our numbers.
[03:51:00.960 --> 03:51:06.041]  Hello, at OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[03:51:06.381 --> 03:51:10.742]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:20.873]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[03:51:20.913 --> 03:51:25.056]  Dear Linda, I would be hard pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[03:51:25.156 --> 03:51:29.319]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[03:51:29.499 --> 03:51:33.942]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[03:51:34.062 --> 03:51:35.923]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[03:51:36.323 --> 03:51:38.164]  I can't say enough about this book.
[03:51:38.284 --> 03:51:40.086]  Blessings to you and your family.
[03:51:40.206 --> 03:51:45.689]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[03:51:45.909 --> 03:51:48.931]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[03:51:49.332 --> 03:51:52.734]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[03:51:52.914 --> 03:51:56.937]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[03:52:02.199 --> 03:52:05.846]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.226 --> 03:52:09.232]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.472 --> 03:52:10.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:11.593 --> 03:52:14.254]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.274 --> 03:52:20.476]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.656 --> 03:52:25.698]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.198 --> 03:52:28.999]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:35.822]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:35.962 --> 03:52:38.063]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.303 --> 03:52:39.624]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:39.884 --> 03:52:42.165]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.345 --> 03:52:44.186]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:44.466 --> 03:52:49.249]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:49.629 --> 03:52:58.733]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.735 --> 03:53:03.115]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[03:53:03.475 --> 03:53:06.756]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[03:53:07.276 --> 03:53:11.497]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[03:53:12.118 --> 03:53:17.159]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[03:53:17.799 --> 03:53:20.160]  Patriotfood.com.
[03:53:20.260 --> 03:53:24.681]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[03:53:25.381 --> 03:53:30.102]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[03:53:31.124 --> 03:53:36.988]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[03:53:37.488 --> 03:53:41.110]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[03:53:41.530 --> 03:53:47.374]  That's over four pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[03:53:47.914 --> 03:53:51.736]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[03:53:52.237 --> 03:53:56.039]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[03:53:56.559 --> 03:53:59.101]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[03:54:07.210 --> 03:54:12.334]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[03:54:12.774 --> 03:54:16.176]  I've never been with anything less than a dime.
[03:54:16.757 --> 03:54:20.279]  So fine, I've been on fire with Sally.
[03:54:20.539 --> 03:54:23.001]  Alexi in Washington, you're on the air.
[03:54:23.021 --> 03:54:25.823]  Hello, Alex.
[03:54:26.524 --> 03:54:27.124]  Hi, go ahead.
[03:54:28.025 --> 03:54:30.426]  Hi, just let me say I love your show.
[03:54:30.466 --> 03:54:32.028]  I've been listening for a long time.
[03:54:32.108 --> 03:54:36.771]  I'm a great fan and listener, and I know everything you're saying is fact.
[03:54:37.270 --> 03:54:37.610]  Fact.
[03:54:37.931 --> 03:54:38.251]  Fact.
[03:54:38.591 --> 03:54:41.013]  And people need to wake up and understand that.
[03:54:41.954 --> 03:54:45.277]  I have been chasing children for a long time.
[03:54:45.357 --> 03:54:45.958]  Ten years.
[03:54:46.658 --> 03:54:52.343]  And what Bob Chapman just said about the Illuminati and the pedophiles is absolutely true.
[03:54:52.924 --> 03:54:57.548]  I would like to do a radio show on your channel about just children.
[03:54:58.909 --> 03:55:01.632]  Well, the way the government preys on them, and I appreciate your call.
[03:55:01.652 --> 03:55:03.053]  Send us some info then, Alexa.
[03:55:03.653 --> 03:55:04.014]  The way
[03:55:05.356 --> 03:55:13.562]  The Justice Department admits CPS is five times more likely to abuse children in every state than any other group.
[03:55:13.602 --> 03:55:16.163]  They're the most egregious.
[03:55:16.944 --> 03:55:24.209]  I mean, any criminologist will tell you, pedophiles try to become truancy officers, they try to become school teachers, they try to become CPS.
[03:55:25.029 --> 03:55:30.673]  And they've caught them all over the country, and they take people's children without due process, and it is monstrous.
[03:55:31.013 --> 03:55:32.334]  Let's talk to Robert in Illinois.
[03:55:32.374 --> 03:55:32.894]  Moving quickly.
[03:55:32.934 --> 03:55:33.475]  Go ahead, Robert.
[03:55:36.172 --> 03:55:36.672]  Mr. Jones.
[03:55:37.032 --> 03:55:38.533]  Yes, sir.
[03:55:38.833 --> 03:55:40.373]  Yeah, I'm in Chicago here.
[03:55:40.393 --> 03:55:43.114]  I listened to another program earlier today on NPR.
[03:55:43.154 --> 03:55:45.374]  It's a locally produced world view.
[03:55:46.054 --> 03:55:49.295]  And they had a global warming special and a quiz on there and everything.
[03:55:50.675 --> 03:55:53.876]  They were disparaging what they called global warming doubters.
[03:55:54.596 --> 03:55:57.777]  And in their quiz, one of the questions was how many people in the UK
[03:55:58.976 --> 03:56:00.456]  Do not believe in global warming.
[03:56:00.556 --> 03:56:01.777]  And it was approximately 1 in 2.
[03:56:01.817 --> 03:56:03.277]  I can't remember the exact number.
[03:56:03.297 --> 03:56:03.877]  I was in my car.
[03:56:04.017 --> 03:56:04.878]  Yeah, that's not true.
[03:56:04.918 --> 03:56:05.738]  Those are Koch numbers.
[03:56:05.798 --> 03:56:07.558]  About 60% in the U.S.
[03:56:07.598 --> 03:56:07.698]  now.
[03:56:07.718 --> 03:56:08.259]  I don't believe it.
[03:56:08.279 --> 03:56:09.619]  It's 50-50 in the U.K.
[03:56:10.499 --> 03:56:11.400]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:56:11.420 --> 03:56:11.740]  It was about 50-50.
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:15.281]  And I just thought that was an interesting statistic.
[03:56:15.341 --> 03:56:19.922]  And these people on here from the Sierra Club and whatnot, they were just laughing at everyone.
[03:56:21.021 --> 03:56:29.089]  Well, I mean, look, being a fake liberal is about being a eugenicist, about being a control freak, about everyone's stupid but you.
[03:56:29.449 --> 03:56:30.871]  That's how they get in these clubs.
[03:56:31.051 --> 03:56:32.692]  Oh, you, you're smart.
[03:56:33.033 --> 03:56:40.200]  You understand we have to forcibly reduce world population and manage and run things and get a lot of money and power for yourself while you do it.
[03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:43.303]  And they're all the same.
[03:56:45.043 --> 03:56:46.223]  They're not liberals at all.
[03:56:46.924 --> 03:56:48.985]  They're just absolutely disgusting people.
[03:56:49.045 --> 03:56:50.505]  Bob in Missouri, you're on the air.
[03:56:50.525 --> 03:56:50.885]  Go ahead.
[03:56:53.566 --> 03:56:57.428]  Where I'm coming from, I voted for Bush twice.
[03:56:58.088 --> 03:56:58.949]  It was so easy.
[03:56:59.029 --> 03:57:01.870]  All I had to do was hold my nose and put the X there.
[03:57:02.350 --> 03:57:04.791]  But I want to plant three ideas to you.
[03:57:06.912 --> 03:57:07.752]  Go ahead.
[03:57:08.172 --> 03:57:14.415]  Can we find a million patriots that will contribute a dollar a day to some kind of a patriotic fund?
[03:57:15.626 --> 03:57:17.307]  You know, money alone won't do it.
[03:57:17.427 --> 03:57:20.148]  The globalists have trillions and they're having trouble running their system.
[03:57:20.208 --> 03:57:23.270]  It's ideas, it's human action, people resisting.
[03:57:23.570 --> 03:57:25.772]  Leslie in Oklahoma, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:57:25.792 --> 03:57:39.099]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to not only thank you, but also thank your wife and kids for their sacrifice, of their time away from you, so you could get the truth out to the rest of us.
[03:57:40.728 --> 03:57:41.128]  Thank you.
[03:57:41.168 --> 03:57:48.570]  It is all-consuming, but I tell you, for any prices we've paid, the dividends of liberty and freedom and the awakening is worth it.
[03:57:48.970 --> 03:57:50.291]  So I appreciate those kind words.
[03:57:50.351 --> 03:57:51.111]  Leslie, anything else?
