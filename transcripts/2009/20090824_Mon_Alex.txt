[00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:03.985]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:07.307]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:14.453]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.194]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:18.056]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:19.477]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:21.178]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:25.501]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:30.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:38.975]  Well, for the next hour... By the way, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the last two hours of the four-hour show today.
[00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.998]  We are joined by John Perkins, best-selling, New York Times No.
[00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:47.039]  1 best-selling, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.723]  He's got his Part 2, vaunted, hoodwinked, about to come out in the next few months.
[00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:55.284]  Already on pre-sale, I'm told.
[00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:58.526]  Guaranteed to be another best-seller, probably No.
[00:00:58.546 --> 00:00:58.786]  1 again.
[00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:02.867]  And by the way, he is in my upcoming film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:08.712]  So we're going to be, and that's a film all about the economy and what these big corporate interests are doing.
[00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:12.695]  It's bipartisan, looking at how both parties are controlled by the same interest.
[00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.837]  So we're honored to have him with us for the next hour.
[00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:19.901]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we're going to open the phone specifically on confessions of an economic hitman.
[00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:26.087]  Most people know who John is, but it's always best maybe to have him just briefly recap
[00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:27.708]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:28.908]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.770]  Incidentally, I really enjoyed talking with your film crew.
[00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.491]  You've got a great group of people.
[00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:34.892]  Yeah, they were there fantastic.
[00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:36.213]  They're really good interviewers.
[00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:37.554]  You're going to have a heck of a film.
[00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:50.189]  Oh, it looks great, too.
[00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.950]  Great shot out your back window of the bay there.
[00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:55.571]  Just wonderful.
[00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:56.772]  Plus, you're a great interview to do.
[00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:59.613]  You're even better in person than over the radio, which is hard to believe.
[00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:01.794]  You're a smooth operator, John Perkins.
[00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:03.855]  It's almost like you're an economic hitman.
[00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.897]  We're really good at patting each other's backs, aren't we, Alex?
[00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:09.258]  No, but it did go well.
[00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:09.898]  It did go well.
[00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:11.719]  And that is exciting.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.461]  Nutshell, tell folks about yourself and get into hoodwinked.
[00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:23.855]  Well, I was an economic hitman, and I think it's fair to say that we economic hitmen have created the world's first truly global empire.
[00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:26.576]  We've done it primarily without the military.
[00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:28.036]  First time in history that's happened.
[00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:36.060]  And we work many ways, but the most common is that we identify a third world country that has resources our corporations covet.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.503]  Then we basically convince, bribe, coerce the leaders of those countries into accepting loans.
[00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.239]  Uh, to build big infrastructure projects.
[00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.760]  But the money doesn't go to those countries.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.544]  Instead, it goes to our own companies that build those projects, like hydro dams and highways and airports.
[00:02:53.584 --> 00:03:05.351]  Things that help acute, very rich people in those countries, but don't help the majority of the people who don't have enough money to buy electricity or drive cars on the highways or work in the industrial parks or benefit from them.
[00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:08.693]  But the country's left holding a huge debt that it can't repay.
[00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:12.528]  So at some point we go back and say, you know, you owe us all this money.
[00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:14.449]  You can't repay us or give us a pound of flesh.
[00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.390]  Sell your oil real cheap to our oil companies.
[00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:19.632]  Or vote with us on the next critical United Nations vote.
[00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.014]  Send troops in support of ours to someplace like Iraq.
[00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:30.679]  And when we fail, I talk in my books about how I failed with Jaime Roldos, President of Ecuador, and Omar Torrijos of Panama.
[00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.861]  When we fail, the jackals go in.
[00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:38.404]  And these are CIA-sponsored people who overthrow governments or assassinate their leaders, both Roldos and
[00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.391]  We're good to go.
[00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:02.186]  I think so.
[00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:19.569]  We're going to go to break when we come back.
[00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.570]  Long segment coming up.
[00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.734]  Let's get into Hoodwinked, which is in many ways a different book than Confessions of Economic Hitman.
[00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.396]  I was in an airport in L.A.
[00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:33.920]  and saw this bookstore full of people with two people
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.204]  Grabbing and buying the books up.
[00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:43.473]  I was watching the stack of economic hitmen go down just in 20 seconds while I was looking at a magazine.
[00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:48.921]  So really exciting that your book has had such success because when I can physically see people
[00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:55.658]  You know, buying it off the shelf in front of me in seconds, it just must be amazing.
[00:04:56.038 --> 00:05:07.166]  When we come back, we'll talk about Hoodwink, probably gonna be even bigger, with John Perkins and his take on the Blackwater revelations, how that ties into CIA hit teams, the Jackals, and a lot more.
[00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:13.814]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:15.875]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:18.316]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.317]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.077]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:23.418]  There is a solution.
[00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:31.664]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:39.149]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:51.157]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:12.590]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:14.631]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:23.134]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:06:23.374 --> 00:06:28.596]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:30.537]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:06:30.777 --> 00:06:37.123]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:48.073]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:06:48.354 --> 00:06:48.874]  That's right.
[00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:51.457]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:06:51.697 --> 00:06:53.278]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.841]  We're good to go.
[00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:09.543]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:11.625]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:12.486]  Well, you should.
[00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:17.050]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.791]  That's right.
[00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:26.559]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.021]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:29.282]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:35.106]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:41.971]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:47.554]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:49.015]  This is real.
[00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:50.076]  Don't miss out.
[00:07:50.396 --> 00:07:57.261]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:07:57.481 --> 00:07:58.762]  And get your free handgun.
[00:07:58.942 --> 00:08:01.104]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:08:01.304 --> 00:08:04.826]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.988]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:14.253]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:16.875]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:24.134]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:24.895]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:25.776]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:26.897]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:27.278]  Eastern.
[00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:33.625]  We are here live simulcasting the last two hours today in living color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:33.665 --> 00:08:36.569]  We're fighting the creation of a prison planet.
[00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:44.261]  Multiple-time best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, and now The Secret History of the American Empire.
[00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:45.382]  Forgot this little best-seller.
[00:08:45.702 --> 00:08:49.726]  The new one's coming out very, very soon, and that is Hoodwinked.
[00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:56.633]  John Perkins, tell us specifically, then we'll get into all these other issues, about Hoodwinked, when it's coming out, what it covers.
[00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:59.816]  It comes out November 10th at Random House, and it's
[00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:13.276]  You know what really generated it was the current recession, and my sense that all of the stuff that we're talking about, AIG, Wall Street, the banks, the auto industry, you know, try and deal with all of that as triage.
[00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:20.499]  It's putting Band-Aids on wounds, and we need the Band-Aids to a certain degree because there's a lot of hemorrhaging going on, we've got to stop.
[00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:27.562]  But what we really need to look at is the root cause beneath the system, beneath the surface, and that is systemic.
[00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:30.672]  And it's something that nobody's really looking at very hard.
[00:09:31.032 --> 00:09:35.516]  To me, this is a mutant form of capitalism that's been going on for about the last 20 years.
[00:09:36.037 --> 00:09:37.058]  Excuse me, 30 years.
[00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.400]  And that's the real problem.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.841]  We must change that.
[00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:44.745]  Sure, we need Band-Aids, but we need to go much, much deeper than that.
[00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:47.668]  Capitalism's been around for about 400 years.
[00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.970]  It's taken many, many different forms.
[00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:51.652]  And in the last
[00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:55.246]  Thirty years, really, since the time of Reagan.
[00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:58.726]  And this has happened on both Democrats and Republicans, but it really started with Reagan.
[00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:06.808]  It's taken this trend toward this very mutant, viral form of capitalism, which is extremely greedy and extremely self-destructive, ultimately.
[00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:17.750]  It's really the form of capitalism that came out of Milton Friedman, the economist from the University of Chicago, and Reagan bought into it big time, and every president since has bought into it.
[00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:25.340]  Well, wasn't the coup de grace in 99 with the Glass-Steagall Act that Bill Clinton got rid of?
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.482]  That was a big one.
[00:10:26.522 --> 00:10:27.443]  There's no question about it.
[00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:30.466]  But that's just sort of like the frosting on the cake.
[00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:31.787]  There was so much going on.
[00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:38.835]  When I went to business school in the late 60s, Alex, God, I hate to think of how long ago,
[00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:48.694]  When I went to business school in the late 60s, all my professors said there could never be another depression like the one in the 30s, because we've enacted all these rules to prevent it.
[00:10:48.714 --> 00:11:00.378]  Well, that was true, but then we changed all that, and Glass-Steagall under Clinton was a huge part of that, but there were a whole slew of them that changed, and a whole lot of attitude toward money and usury rates.
[00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:07.600]  Under George Bush, we had huge increases in interest rates that people had to pay.
[00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:08.521]  Credit cards went up to 35%.
[00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:13.868]  Yeah, now they allow over 30 percent, that's supposed credit card reform.
[00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:16.210]  I mean, that's above loan sharking.
[00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.954]  Yeah, well, yeah, and that's way beyond, the laws never would have permitted this before.
[00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:22.388]  Amazing.
[00:11:22.408 --> 00:11:25.009]  Well, the book is coming out on November 11th, correct John?
[00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:25.629]  November 10th.
[00:11:49.713 --> 00:11:55.037]  Okay, so November 10th, and we've got you scheduled for the 11th then, good.
[00:11:55.377 --> 00:11:56.238]  Oh, good.
[00:11:56.278 --> 00:11:56.938]  Fantastic.
[00:11:57.178 --> 00:12:04.403]  They just handed me a note saying he is scheduled for November 11th when it comes out, so my producer was wrong by one day, so it's coming out November 10th.
[00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:06.105]  Now, I agree with a lot of what you have to say.
[00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:17.213]  Later in the interview, I want to get into maybe somewhat of a debate about economic systems and choices, but I think what we agree on is this crony capitalist system, this mutant form of capitalism,
[00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:19.095]  I just call it piracy.
[00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:33.731]  I mean, if they can just create trillions in made-up derivatives and then have the central governments bail them out when they're using the money to then go loan it at loan-sharking rates to third-world countries, third-world people, the American people, I mean, that's sick.
[00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:35.794]  We give them the government-backed loans.
[00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.457]  They then leverage it, fractional reserve it.
[00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:44.263]  And then we pay interest to the banks on our money they loan back to us.
[00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:46.425]  I mean, is that a good way of boiling it down?
[00:12:46.445 --> 00:12:48.006]  That certainly is.
[00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:49.327]  And it is piracy.
[00:12:49.347 --> 00:12:50.408]  There's no question about it.
[00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:52.950]  And we must turn it around, Alex.
[00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:59.495]  And that's really a large part of Hoodwinked is what we can do, what you and I and all your listeners can do.
[00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.037]  We can take control of this.
[00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:07.502]  One of the things that we have to understand is that big corporations, the banks and the other corporations that are behind this,
[00:13:08.137 --> 00:13:09.918]  They are very beholden to us.
[00:13:09.938 --> 00:13:14.000]  They only exist because we give them business.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.722]  We buy their goods and services, or we allow our tax dollars and our government to go into that.
[00:13:19.082 --> 00:13:22.804]  There are many ways to resist, and I think it's terribly important that we do that now.
[00:13:22.864 --> 00:13:24.205]  We must turn this thing around.
[00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:33.509]  You know, what we have to realize in all of this is that this economic crisis is basically telling us that we have a failed system, totally failed, on a global basis.
[00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:40.256]  Less than 5% of the world's population live in the United States and we consume more than 25% of the world's resources.
[00:13:40.856 --> 00:13:41.637]  That's a failure.
[00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:46.440]  It's not a model that you can give to China or India or Latin America or Africa.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:53.344]  You'd need another 5 or 6 planets with all our resources and no people to be able to use this as a model for other people.
[00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:56.106]  So what we're seeing is a totally failed system.
[00:13:56.606 --> 00:14:00.509]  And we must understand that for our sake, for our children's sake, and our grandchildren's sake,
[00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:02.306]  We have to turn this around.
[00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:04.448]  We have to come up with a very, very different system.
[00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:19.561]  John Perkins, I want to get into that area because I agree with you on so much, but I also disagree with you in some areas because we know we do have a wasteful form of life.
[00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:42.853]  Lifestyle we know we're four percent of the world's population in the US and we use roughly half the world's resources And we know there's a lot of toxic waste associated with that and a lot of problems But the way I see government addressing that and the big mega corporations addressing it is by haunt showing and steering the environmental movement to simply set up new taxes and control and
[00:14:43.413 --> 00:14:50.796]  To further vertically integrate the consolidation of power in this new phase of robber baron colonialism.
[00:14:51.156 --> 00:15:00.979]  Because they fundamentally know that there is a certain truth to what's happening to the environment on many levels.
[00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:08.302]  And so they wrap the truth around their overall lie of this new bank of the world, global government.
[00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:11.497]  Absolutely, and the way that they distort the truth and
[00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:38.233]  You know, move groups.
[00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:50.639]  So today we've got this huge grassroots movement basically supported by the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry opposing any kind of real insurance for people that don't have insurance.
[00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:59.704]  We've got the corporations out there making it, trying to make it look as though the people are behind so much of what just benefits the corporation.
[00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:06.227]  And, you know, I think one amazing instance of this is what's just happened in Honduras,
[00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:21.295]  A democratically elected president was overthrown by a military regime that was under the control of the CIA and big American corporate interests, the big agribusinesses, Dole, Chiquita, Kraft, Cargill, as well as the textile industry.
[00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:32.960]  And yet, here in the United States, we're being told that this is a president who was trying to usurp the democratic process in Honduras, which is not true at all.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.261]  He asked for a referendum.
[00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:36.111]  I think.
[00:16:50.458 --> 00:17:06.690]  And just to be clear, Obama came out day one a month ago and said, we're not involved, this is terrible, but now even mainstream media has come out and clearly shown private corporations, mercenaries, CIA front groups, jackals, hyenas that you call them,
[00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:14.756]  Well, Economic Hitman went into Honduras originally, tried to convince Zelaya, the president of Honduras, to change his ways, because what he was saying is that
[00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:40.597]  Honduras is going to increase its minimum wage by 60 percent.
[00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:49.223]  And that has a huge impact on gold and tequila and those who hire laborers out in the field to pick their pie, you know, all their goods.
[00:17:49.843 --> 00:17:53.305]  So they're going to go from, what, 50 cents an hour to $1.10 or something?
[00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:54.746]  Exactly.
[00:17:54.766 --> 00:17:56.967]  It seems very minimal to us.
[00:17:57.648 --> 00:18:04.192]  And also that there's a lot of sweatshops from our textile companies, you know, like Nike and other companies like that in there.
[00:18:04.758 --> 00:18:10.840]  But it's much bigger than that, Alex, because something similar happened with Aristide and Haiti.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:20.082]  And both Haiti and Honduras are looked at as the bottom rung on the ladder of wages in Latin America.
[00:18:20.522 --> 00:18:22.743]  So no country will go below those countries.
[00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:32.846]  So if, in fact, Honduras or Haiti increases their minimum wage, then Ecuador and Nicaragua and El Salvador and every other country in the southern hemisphere
[00:18:33.357 --> 00:18:38.580]  Have to increase its wages to stay above those because no one wants to go below those countries.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.522]  So it wasn't just about Honduras anymore than it was just about Haiti.
[00:18:42.602 --> 00:18:48.465]  It was about drawing a line in the sand and saying, we are not going to permit this to happen.
[00:18:48.905 --> 00:18:52.467]  And I think we have to understand that there's a revolution going on in Latin America.
[00:18:52.607 --> 00:18:59.391]  Ten countries representing more than 80% of the population of South America have voted in in the last few years
[00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:04.353]  Progressive presidents who are saying no more exploitation by these foreign corporations.
[00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:14.359]  Ten countries, and every one of these countries, Alex, during most of my lifetime was run by brutal dictators who were under the control of the CIA and big corporations.
[00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.860]  That's all changed very, very recently.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.382]  And so the line in the sand now has been drawn in Honduras.
[00:19:22.923 --> 00:19:28.546]  This is a fairly easy country to do it, but this is trying to establish a whole new precedent saying, look,
[00:19:29.025 --> 00:19:30.947]  We're stopping this revolution right here.
[00:19:31.548 --> 00:19:37.515]  And in stopping it, we're also going to undermine these other ten countries that have already voted in these presidents.
[00:19:38.356 --> 00:19:46.126]  And most of the American people don't have any idea that this is going on, and our media has been very flaccid in informing us.
[00:19:47.027 --> 00:19:47.568]  Other than you.
[00:19:47.968 --> 00:19:48.609]  And a few others.
[00:19:49.212 --> 00:19:58.021]  Well, we're trying to get all points of view and all issues in here, and clearly the CIA was involved in this because they want to keep those people down.
[00:19:58.482 --> 00:19:59.563]  It's like that movie Ants.
[00:19:59.603 --> 00:20:07.211]  If you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up, and those little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:20:10.012 --> 00:20:16.015]  If you'd like to replace the ineffective and toxic cleaning products under your sink, you need to visit BioGreenClean.com.
[00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:23.378]  BioGreenClean is the first heavy-duty, all-natural, multipurpose cleaner that outperforms every other competitive cleaning product on the market today.
[00:20:23.678 --> 00:20:32.022]  BioGreenClean is tough enough to take on the kitchen, the bathroom, your outdoor grill, and virtually anything in your car, home, boat, or office, yet is safe enough for your children and pets.
[00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:35.244]  BioGreenClean does not contain harmful chemical solvents.
[00:20:35.504 --> 00:20:36.165]  We're good to go.
[00:21:02.001 --> 00:21:15.228]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:15.928 --> 00:21:21.291]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:27.974]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:28.294 --> 00:21:30.116]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:30.256 --> 00:21:32.658]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:21:32.738 --> 00:21:43.666]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:21:45.908 --> 00:21:47.209]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:48.991]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:55.676]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:56.343 --> 00:22:04.116]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:04.617 --> 00:22:05.779]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:07.381]  The people strike back!
[00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:11.647]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:11.908 --> 00:22:12.108]  August 24, 2009.
[00:22:12.188 --> 00:22:13.229]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5660.
[00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:16.593]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.8389, $4.9195 for a half-ounce, or $2.4597 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:22:16.633 --> 00:22:17.093]  That's $9.8389, $4.9195, or $2.4597.
[00:22:29.193 --> 00:22:42.716]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:43.797]  Is this capitalism?
[00:22:44.037 --> 00:22:51.419]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:52.599]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:52.719 --> 00:22:56.880]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.100]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.161 --> 00:22:59.981]  Isn't it time to understand the system?

[00:23:00.261 --> 00:23:00.562]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:16.222]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.

[00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:21.493]  The new book, Hoodwinked, coming out November 10th.
[00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:22.734]  John Perkins, our guest.
[00:24:23.154 --> 00:24:32.235]  Your phone calls specifically for John Perkins on a wide range of issues.
[00:24:32.255 --> 00:24:32.715]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:32.735 --> 00:24:33.736]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.316 --> 00:24:36.136]  Coming up in the balance of the next half hour.
[00:24:37.496 --> 00:24:46.318]  John, you specifically, all over Latin America, all over Asia, you were kind of the velvet glove, I would describe it from reading your book.
[00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:55.456]  And also reading other government documents about similar programs going in trying to, you know, give them the carrot instead of the stick.
[00:24:55.837 --> 00:24:57.178]  But when the stick goes in...
[00:24:59.036 --> 00:24:59.677]  What happens?
[00:24:59.877 --> 00:25:09.844]  And then asking that question, I want to preface it with, obviously you know about Blackwater running hit teams, but the media has spun this saying, oh, just killing Al Qaeda.
[00:25:10.184 --> 00:25:11.645]  That's whoever they say Al Qaeda is.
[00:25:12.146 --> 00:25:17.310]  Now it turns out it's business people, political enemies, business enemies of the White House.
[00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.192]  Actual private merc teams.
[00:25:20.612 --> 00:25:33.261]  We know Delta Force and other groups out of the Pentagon have engaged in murder, but is this new to have private contractors doing it, or are we now just learning about it because of the internet age?
[00:25:33.762 --> 00:25:34.823]  It's not new at all.
[00:25:34.903 --> 00:25:36.304]  It's been going on for a long time.
[00:25:36.364 --> 00:25:40.027]  Back in the 70s when I was an economic hitman, we used private contractors.
[00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:41.748]  That's the way it's done.
[00:25:41.768 --> 00:25:47.172]  You know, the old times of the 007, the government agent licensed killer, long, long gone.
[00:25:48.062 --> 00:25:48.542]  I don't know.
[00:26:07.276 --> 00:26:08.638]  There's no terrorism out there.
[00:26:09.379 --> 00:26:13.365]  There are people who practice terrorism, but from many different walks of life.
[00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:18.373]  So the FARC members in Colombia have nothing in common with a Somali pirate.
[00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:19.604]  Or Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:19.904 --> 00:26:22.646]  And yet they're all lumped under this one ism.
[00:26:23.467 --> 00:26:35.656]  Isn't the War on Terror, John, just a global letter of marque by Western governments to kill, steal, destroy, torture, murder whoever you want and anybody that resists you is called a terrorist?
[00:26:35.836 --> 00:26:36.957]  That's a great way to put it.
[00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:38.178]  Yes, the letter of marque.
[00:26:38.198 --> 00:26:39.999]  That's a great way to put it, Alex.
[00:26:40.603 --> 00:26:45.269]  Yeah, you know, there was communism, and that truly existed.
[00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:51.117]  There's Catholicism, and there's all kinds of isms, but terrorism really isn't an ism.
[00:26:51.197 --> 00:26:55.182]  You know, there's al-Qaedaism, there's Farcism, but they're totally separate.
[00:26:55.937 --> 00:27:00.938]  And yeah, this is just a way of making it sound as though we've got some huge enemy out there.
[00:27:01.278 --> 00:27:13.621]  What we really got out there is a bunch of starving people, unhappy people, who latch on to fanatical leaders like Osama Bin Laden because they don't know what else to do.
[00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:15.762]  And they do it under FARC and Columbia.
[00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:20.303]  I know a lot of the members of FARC, and I shouldn't say a lot, I know some members of FARC.
[00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:28.130]  These are farmers who were driven off their land by big hydroelectric projects or oil fields that destroyed their farming land.
[00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.951]  They have no way to feed their families.
[00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:30.992]  They don't know where to go.
[00:27:31.012 --> 00:27:39.577]  So when an organization comes along like FARC that offers to provide them with money for their families and food, they join it.
[00:27:39.938 --> 00:27:44.100]  I suspect the same is true with Al-Qaeda and with the Taliban to a certain degree.
[00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:45.481]  Well, John, what about this?
[00:27:45.561 --> 00:27:48.803]  I've actually found in my research a lot of times
[00:27:50.055 --> 00:28:01.879]  Western powers and corporations will actually fund the radical group that is bloody and crooked as a way down the road to then successfully demonize the entire indigenous population.
[00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:09.521]  So they always push people towards the most radicalized, knowing down the road that will discredit the indigenous resistance.
[00:28:09.941 --> 00:28:11.542]  It discredits the right.
[00:28:11.562 --> 00:28:15.685]  It does do that, and it also creates a huge economy for big military suppliers.
[00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:19.428]  So here we've got this war on terrorism in Colombia.
[00:28:19.848 --> 00:28:22.410]  Colombia is the fourth largest recipient of U.S.
[00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:29.354]  military aid in the world, largest in Latin America, but it's fourth behind Iraq, Israel, and Egypt.
[00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:33.757]  Fancy that, to fight what we're saying are narco-traffickers.
[00:28:34.258 --> 00:28:34.838]  It's absurd.
[00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:39.081]  We're creating a war there, basically, so we can put military bases there.
[00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:43.995]  And we can supply huge amounts of military equipment to this country.
[00:28:44.015 --> 00:28:49.900]  So we give them the money under the understanding that they'll buy back equipment from us and allow us to have military bases there.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.885]  Yeah, you know, this goes back to the opium wars of the British Empire in China and India.
[00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:57.786]  It's a very, very old tale.
[00:28:58.387 --> 00:28:59.908]  And we're just continuing to do it.
[00:28:59.928 --> 00:29:04.212]  And unfortunately, a huge sector of the American population falls for it.
[00:29:05.145 --> 00:29:06.185]  We're going to get a break in a moment.
[00:29:06.225 --> 00:29:11.907]  Long segment coming up and we're going to get more into that and also one of the new constitutions in Ecuador.
[00:29:12.407 --> 00:29:16.729]  But did you see the... I'll ask the question now, we'll come back and you can answer it.
[00:29:17.709 --> 00:29:20.690]  Ridge, fellow cabinet members pushed terror alerts.
[00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:28.613]  Now, we know Ari Fleischer, back in 2003, admitted they were issuing fake terror alerts at a press conference.
[00:29:28.853 --> 00:29:32.074]  And I understand he did it because he knew it was criminal.
[00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:34.721]  He never said why, but I was guessing at this.
[00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:39.342]  And that he didn't want to get in trouble down the road as if he was involved.
[00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:44.263]  Now that's what Ridge is saying, that he's coming clean because he doesn't want to get in trouble.
[00:29:44.623 --> 00:29:51.464]  And the news is saying this is clearly criminal to issue fake terror alerts just for political gain.
[00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:53.665]  So talk about stage crises.
[00:29:54.265 --> 00:29:58.545]  How do these big corporations and governments use stage crises to get the job done?
[00:29:59.225 --> 00:30:00.106]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:02.126]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.121 --> 00:30:05.923]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:13.890]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.893]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:23.738]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:24.038 --> 00:30:28.902]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:29.102 --> 00:30:29.603]  Number three,
[00:30:30.003 --> 00:30:35.450]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:30:36.291 --> 00:30:38.955]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:30:39.195 --> 00:30:42.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:47.346]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:30:47.566 --> 00:30:53.052]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:11.828]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:12.228 --> 00:31:17.211]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:17.572 --> 00:31:19.313]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:19.613 --> 00:31:24.436]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:25.577]  How much do you want?
[00:31:25.797 --> 00:31:26.557]  When do you want it?
[00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.519]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:29.639]  When will you need it?
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.961]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:33.182]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:33.422 --> 00:31:34.743]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:37.324]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:31:37.484 --> 00:31:40.005]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:40.205 --> 00:31:43.387]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:43.787 --> 00:31:47.289]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:47.609 --> 00:31:48.609]  How much will you need?
[00:31:48.829 --> 00:31:49.450]  We don't know.
[00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:50.650]  How much do you want?
[00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.571]  All you can get.
[00:31:51.591 --> 00:31:52.171]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:52.951 --> 00:31:53.732]  We're good to go.
[00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:12.342]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:32:12.582 --> 00:32:14.383]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:32:14.604 --> 00:32:22.870]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:28.353]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:32:28.674 --> 00:32:30.295]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:36.857]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:32:37.037 --> 00:32:47.799]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:32:48.079 --> 00:32:48.599]  That's right.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.160]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.001]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:32:54.941 --> 00:32:55.342]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:32:55.362 --> 00:32:58.948]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:32:58.988 --> 00:33:00.611]  That's A Cola Blue dot com.
[00:33:20.094 --> 00:33:20.214]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:20.414]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:21.035]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:22.936]  Glad that you could join us today.
[00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:40.521]  I'm looking for my sponsor folder here in front of me, flailing.
[00:33:42.902 --> 00:33:45.222]  I'm flailing around incoherently.
[00:33:45.242 --> 00:33:48.604]  We're going to go back to John Perkins here in just a moment.
[00:33:49.444 --> 00:33:53.566]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about one of our great new sponsors.
[00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:57.588]  And they're offering a deal the likes of which they never offered before.
[00:33:57.728 --> 00:34:02.291]  So I would suggest everyone take advantage of this now.
[00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:06.333]  In fact, one of the most popular times of year is during the fall.
[00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:10.256]  And that is when the classes generally completely fill up quickly.
[00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:16.997]  And especially now because they're offering a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:34:17.518 --> 00:34:24.419]  It's FrontSite.com, FrontSite.com, FrontSite Firearms Training with Dr. Ignatius Piazza.
[00:34:24.899 --> 00:34:35.342]  This is the biggest and most successful private firearms training facility in the country, above law enforcement, military, with no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[00:34:35.942 --> 00:34:44.228]  Find out about this incredible deal on five days of world-class firearms training at FrontSight.com and a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:34:44.488 --> 00:34:45.949]  That's FrontSight.com.
[00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.111]  Check it out today.
[00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:53.594]  Okay, going now back to John Perkins.
[00:34:55.353 --> 00:35:00.039]  Author of the new upcoming book, Hoodwinked, out November 10th.
[00:35:00.459 --> 00:35:06.306]  Again, previously he wrote The Secret History of the American Empire and, of course, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:35:06.967 --> 00:35:08.669]  You heard me throw out that question.
[00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:11.793]  As more and more comes out, I mean, Cheney
[00:35:13.087 --> 00:35:19.371]  Ordering private hit teams and Delta Force hit teams to murder his enemies overseas, corporate enemies overseas.
[00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:23.233]  Ridge being ordered to issue fake terror alerts.
[00:35:23.933 --> 00:35:32.478]  And Obama is saying, no investigation of torture, no investigation of Blackwater, no investigation of any of this.
[00:35:33.018 --> 00:35:36.100]  Or he'll do the corporate tactic of saying, I'm looking at it but then not do it.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.242]  He's keeping the continual secret arrest, indefinite detention.
[00:35:42.842 --> 00:35:47.744]  Can you speak to prosecuting or at least investigating Bush?
[00:35:48.364 --> 00:35:50.705]  Or can we just, I guess, let him get away with it?
[00:35:50.725 --> 00:35:59.347]  I mean, what does this do precedent-wise to let them get away with Blackwater and underage girls and all the rest of it?
[00:35:59.367 --> 00:36:00.988]  I mean, is there no end?
[00:36:01.028 --> 00:36:03.849]  If we put up with this level of evil, what comes next?
[00:36:04.654 --> 00:36:06.895]  You're exactly right.
[00:36:07.715 --> 00:36:08.815]  We mustn't put up with this.
[00:36:09.715 --> 00:36:11.896]  I think we, the people, must really speak out.
[00:36:12.656 --> 00:36:15.877]  My own belief, you know, I think Obama's in a very difficult spot.
[00:36:16.837 --> 00:36:19.157]  Obviously, I'm not privy to what's going on with him.
[00:36:19.237 --> 00:36:20.298]  I'm not a psychologist.
[00:36:20.938 --> 00:36:25.199]  But he has to know that Kennedy was assassinated.
[00:36:25.519 --> 00:36:26.919]  Two Kennedys were assassinated.
[00:36:26.939 --> 00:36:27.919]  I mean, U.S.
[00:36:27.959 --> 00:36:29.240]  presidents get assassinated, too.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.600]  It isn't just foreign presidents.
[00:36:31.178 --> 00:36:34.741]  And once you're in that White House, I think you begin to see things that you never saw before.
[00:36:34.761 --> 00:36:38.383]  I suspect Obama's getting tremendous amounts of pressure put on him.
[00:36:38.824 --> 00:36:41.246]  It's one of the reasons he's been caving in to so many things.
[00:36:41.606 --> 00:36:50.292]  You know, his own Attorney General, Eric Holder, was a partner at a law firm called Covington & Burling, LLP.
[00:36:50.993 --> 00:36:58.138]  This law firm defended Chiquita, the big banana company that's now the big company in Honduras,
[00:36:59.727 --> 00:37:07.376]  Chiquita was accused of hiring assassination squads in Colombia, and their main defender was an attorney named Eric Holder, who's now our Attorney General.
[00:37:07.776 --> 00:37:08.837]  Is that United Fruit?
[00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:10.459]  Chiquita.
[00:37:11.681 --> 00:37:13.142]  What was Chiquita formula?
[00:37:13.162 --> 00:37:15.024]  Was it Standard Fruit or United Fruit?
[00:37:15.104 --> 00:37:17.807]  Yeah, Chiquita was United Fruit at one time.
[00:37:18.676 --> 00:37:24.377]  And, uh... So that's the famous folks, uh, then overthrowing on record, Guatemala.
[00:37:24.477 --> 00:37:26.718]  Arbans of Guatemala, yes, back in the 50's.
[00:37:26.758 --> 00:37:28.258]  So, same story over and over again.
[00:37:28.298 --> 00:37:28.978]  Sorry for interrupting.
[00:37:28.998 --> 00:37:29.638]  Go ahead.
[00:37:29.818 --> 00:37:30.458]  Same story.
[00:37:30.798 --> 00:37:34.859]  Chiquita, incidentally, was found guilty of hiring assassination squads in Colombia.
[00:37:34.879 --> 00:37:37.840]  In fact, it is admitted that it had paid organizations listed by the U.S.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.420]  government as terrorist groups for protection and paid a $25 million fine in 2004.
[00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:57.779]  Eric Holder, our current Attorney General, was their main defender then, and now he's defending the actions of the coup that overthrew the Democratic-elected President Honduras.
[00:37:58.259 --> 00:38:14.647]  It's just another instance, Alex, of how ingrained all of this is in all of our governments, whether we have Democrats in there, including the most liberal Democrat we've had, the current one, Obama, or whether we have conservative Republicans like Bush.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.261]  The real people in control are the big corporations.
[00:38:17.882 --> 00:38:19.803]  And they really run the system.
[00:38:19.963 --> 00:38:22.584]  We're seeing this over and over and over again.
[00:38:23.685 --> 00:38:34.371]  And so, you've got guys like Cheney, you've got guys like all the cabinet members you mentioned earlier, who now are trying not to be found guilty of being involved in assassination attempts.
[00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:40.014]  But the fact of the matter is, all these people at the top of government came from out of the big corporations.
[00:38:40.034 --> 00:38:41.575]  It's a revolving door thing.
[00:38:42.068 --> 00:38:47.114]  And so, whether it's Democrats or Republicans, you've got people that are constantly at the top.
[00:38:47.234 --> 00:38:49.036]  I call it the corporateocracy.
[00:38:49.096 --> 00:38:57.886]  Because whether they're working for the government or whether they're working for private corporations, they're all working for the same thing, which is expanding this empire.
[00:38:58.424 --> 00:39:04.050]  Well John Perkins, I'm not defending Obama because I saw him built up as this big corporate juggernaut.
[00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.974]  I saw him getting four plus times the money that McCain got.
[00:39:07.994 --> 00:39:09.516]  I wasn't supporting McCain either.
[00:39:09.536 --> 00:39:12.058]  I just was clear he was the anointed one.
[00:39:12.944 --> 00:39:16.628]  But I do have to give credit when I do occasionally see it.
[00:39:17.128 --> 00:39:27.358]  Panetta did scurry over immediately to Congress within days of getting in and said, look, they just admitted to me they've got all these head squads.
[00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:29.580]  So at least he did that.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.922]  But was that him covering his butt?
[00:39:31.983 --> 00:39:32.963]  Because then you bring up
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:41.305]  Well, you know, again, I don't have any inside information on Obama's personality or those people around him, but my suspicion is that he's probably a guy with a conscience.
[00:40:02.128 --> 00:40:10.591]  Who would like to do the right thing, and so would many of his people, but you get caught in the system, and once you're in, it's extremely scary.
[00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:11.792]  And what are you going to do?
[00:40:11.832 --> 00:40:12.972]  How are you going to fight the CIA?
[00:40:13.112 --> 00:40:14.493]  How are you going to fight the military?
[00:40:14.953 --> 00:40:18.334]  So you try to do whatever you can on whatever front you can.
[00:40:18.354 --> 00:40:30.619]  And I've seen this happen time and time again with Latin American presidents who want to do the right things, but realize that if they get thrown out or if they get assassinated, that's not going to do any good, because the next president coming along is just going to be scared
[00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.962]  Terribly scared, and they're not going to do anything.
[00:40:33.382 --> 00:40:36.583]  So you try to stay in power, and you try to do what you can.
[00:40:36.623 --> 00:40:48.546]  In the case of a guy like Obama, he's tried to institute some environmental laws that are decent, and he's tried to do things with health insurance, but he keeps running up against very, very powerful forces of resistance.
[00:40:49.407 --> 00:40:50.627]  And so it comes down to us.
[00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:53.248]  We have to speak out a lot more.
[00:40:53.328 --> 00:40:54.688]  We have to do a lot more.
[00:40:54.728 --> 00:40:55.448]  We the people.
[00:40:55.869 --> 00:41:00.150]  We have to stand up to corporations and say, listen, I'm not buying from Dole or Chiquita.
[00:41:00.987 --> 00:41:07.789]  You know, and send them emails and tell them, we're never buying another one of your bananas or pineapples because of what you're doing in Honduras.
[00:41:07.809 --> 00:41:10.450]  You change your ways or we're going to force you to go out of business.
[00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:15.052]  And I'll tell you what, if enough of us do that, they'll have to change their ways.
[00:41:15.132 --> 00:41:24.715]  If enough of us stop buying Nike and send them emails and say, we're not buying from you because you get sweatshops in Indonesia and instead we buy from sweatshop free organizations and send them emails.
[00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:34.406]  I do agree with you that responsible consumerism is one of the strongest tools we've got.
[00:41:34.426 --> 00:41:38.869]  That's why these monopoly men want to create nothing but cartels where we don't even have a choice.
[00:41:39.429 --> 00:41:40.830]  But, I mean, just take ten years ago.
[00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:44.473]  You couldn't find organic even in Austin or San Francisco.
[00:41:44.493 --> 00:41:45.253]  It was hard to get.
[00:41:45.674 --> 00:41:50.898]  Now, organics, even in small towns, because people demanded it and then built a market
[00:41:51.798 --> 00:41:54.399]  Buying local is getting bigger and bigger.
[00:41:54.699 --> 00:42:05.242]  And we've got, because the companies, they trans-fab a lot of food recently, and you know, we got rid of aerosol cans, we're destroying the ozone layer, we've got companies to clean up terribly polluted rivers.
[00:42:05.622 --> 00:42:07.903]  We have a lot of power when we use it.
[00:42:07.923 --> 00:42:11.204]  I think we need to understand that it's always come from we, the people.
[00:42:11.804 --> 00:42:16.746]  We didn't get rid of slavery in this country because Abraham Lincoln found himself at the White House.
[00:42:17.266 --> 00:42:21.327]  We got rid of slavery because we voted in a president, Lincoln, who was opposed to slavery.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.043]  Women didn't get the right to vote because Woodrow Wilson was pro-suffrage.
[00:42:26.103 --> 00:42:26.864]  He was not.
[00:42:27.424 --> 00:42:30.487]  Women get the right to vote because they've been demonstrating for it for a long time.
[00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:39.073]  And then, when Wilson was president, he constantly was out on the road speaking about how we needed to get involved in World War I, how we needed to defend democracy in Europe.
[00:42:39.493 --> 00:42:47.880]  Women met him at every place he went, holding up huge placards that said, why should we defend democracy in Europe when half of our population in the United States can't vote?
[00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:52.144]  So finally, Woodrow Wilson came around.
[00:42:52.564 --> 00:42:55.906]  We didn't get out of Vietnam because Richard Nixon was anti-war.
[00:42:55.926 --> 00:42:57.346]  He was pro-war.
[00:42:57.727 --> 00:43:03.129]  He had to take us out of Vietnam because he understood that we, the people, were not going to put up with it any longer, plus we were losing the war.
[00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.732]  But I think we need to understand that we, the people, need to take action.
[00:43:08.192 --> 00:43:14.535]  And in this particular case, in some respects, it's easier than it's ever been because these things are all controlled by big corporations today.
[00:43:15.211 --> 00:43:18.393]  And the marketplace is democratic if we choose to make it such.
[00:43:18.873 --> 00:43:25.017]  These corporations only exist because we buy the goods and services or our tax dollars buy the goods and services.
[00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:27.078]  Alex, we need to turn that around.
[00:43:27.118 --> 00:43:29.819]  We, the people, need to start taking more responsibility.
[00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:35.943]  It doesn't do any good to complain about these things and then go out and buy bananas from Dole or tennis shoes from Nike.
[00:43:36.641 --> 00:43:46.088]  Sure, John, I agree with you on that front, and I believe you're coming at this from a good perspective, that you're a good guy, that you have changed your ways.
[00:43:46.908 --> 00:43:52.872]  I just think it's also important to realize that just trying to do the right thing isn't enough.
[00:43:52.932 --> 00:43:59.077]  We have to make sure we're not part of the fake corporate clone or counterfeit
[00:44:00.287 --> 00:44:08.751]  Where they try to get control of our grassroots movements and then say use environmental laws to take farms and ranches or restrict people.
[00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:09.432]  Take Austin.
[00:44:09.832 --> 00:44:11.233]  I've watched them with smart growth.
[00:44:11.713 --> 00:44:13.954]  Take farms and ranches, not let people build on it.
[00:44:14.474 --> 00:44:18.356]  And then ten years later, they build shopping malls on it and skyscrapers.
[00:44:18.836 --> 00:44:23.319]  So I also see the environmental movement run by the big banks, by the very
[00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:25.360]  We're good to go.
[00:44:45.007 --> 00:44:51.534]  It's a big job to navigate this and try to figure out what's real and what isn't, and how do you not get co-opted.
[00:44:51.554 --> 00:45:01.204]  I mean, because it sounds great to take Ecuador and say they have a constitution saying that they're going to give trees and animals rights, but then I always see that
[00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:12.373]  By the neo-eugenicists as their pretext to say the world government's going to vote for you because it's voting for the cockroaches and the dolphins and they outvote humanity.
[00:45:12.673 --> 00:45:19.259]  So I'm just saying this is a minefield because these global corporations are in power because they are so slick.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:28.746]  Well, you're right about that, but you know, I think that we can see beyond a great deal of that.
[00:45:29.627 --> 00:45:30.588]  We can see that there
[00:45:31.107 --> 00:45:32.887]  That they're using their power and abusing it.
[00:45:33.247 --> 00:45:36.168]  We can see this in the way they take care of themselves.
[00:45:36.408 --> 00:45:41.269]  I do a lot of speaking at business schools these days, which I find ironic that business schools even invite me to speak.
[00:45:41.369 --> 00:45:43.630]  I wrote a book called Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:48.270]  But the kids in these business schools, many of them are really interested in some of these subjects.
[00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:52.331]  And one of the things I keep running into is some of the icons that are held up there.
[00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:56.072]  A guy named Jack Welch, who was CEO of General Electric.
[00:45:56.493 --> 00:45:57.793]  Yeah, it's engaged in derivatives, that's right.
[00:46:23.328 --> 00:46:27.590]  How do we, yeah, so how do we hold a guy like that out as an icon in our business schools?
[00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:28.331]  We should not.
[00:46:28.851 --> 00:46:32.793]  And I think if we really open our hearts to these things, we understand that.
[00:46:32.853 --> 00:46:33.834]  You understand that, Alex.
[00:46:33.974 --> 00:46:34.594]  I understand it.
[00:46:34.974 --> 00:46:42.398]  We've got to turn this thing around and we've got to present better examples to our kids of who do they want to emulate?
[00:46:42.498 --> 00:46:44.640]  Who do we want to put on the covers of our magazines?
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.161]  Do we want to put Crook's modern Robert Barron?
[00:46:47.751 --> 00:46:50.833]  On the cover of our magazine, or do we want to put people there who are really trying?
[00:46:50.853 --> 00:46:51.773]  I totally agree with you.
[00:46:51.793 --> 00:47:14.426]  In fact, I talk so much about the map-making of the mind, or blueprints in the mind, how the establishment builds these, and I'm not saying Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods or somebody shouldn't be on the cover of something, or Brock Lesnar of Ultimate Fighting, but when this country was the jewel in the crown of the Renaissance, the stars were inventors and scientists and humanitarians
[00:47:15.831 --> 00:47:17.872]  And people that stood up against corruption.
[00:47:18.273 --> 00:47:25.657]  And so the establishment very cunningly took our real heroes away and gave us heroes of no consequence.
[00:47:25.837 --> 00:47:26.558]  Well, that's true.
[00:47:26.698 --> 00:47:27.998]  And we don't need to let that happen anymore.
[00:47:28.018 --> 00:47:30.020]  Yeah, you mentioned Tiger Woods, for example.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:35.283]  My God, you know, here's a guy that's making, I don't know what he's making this year, $40 million off Nike or whatever.
[00:47:35.723 --> 00:47:37.644]  Meanwhile, Nike's paying... No, he's paid $109 million.
[00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:49.996]  Well, I mean, well, Nike's paying its workers in Indonesia that make all the things that Michael Jordan is advertising, sub-living standard wages.
[00:47:50.637 --> 00:47:55.721]  These people are living almost like slaves, and that's well documented.
[00:47:56.201 --> 00:48:01.845]  So, you know, why doesn't Tiger Woods, if he wants to be our hero, he doesn't need to give any more golf balls.
[00:48:01.885 --> 00:48:05.728]  What he needs to do is say, listen, I'm not going to let Nike get away with this anymore.
[00:48:05.748 --> 00:48:06.669]  I'm going to speak out.
[00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:28.902]  Or I'm going to advertise some other company, and I'll do it for free, some company that's paying their... That would revolutionize the world, but see, Tiger Woods, the only reason I know about this is I've looked into him, and I heard the number on the radio, on Fox News Radio, they announced his hundred plus million dollar contract, and that's just Nike, not counting this watch and that shirt and...
[00:48:29.562 --> 00:48:46.329]  I guess all of us have to not buy it while they do that, but Tiger Woods has been interviewed how he isn't involved in any politics, in any policies, in any charities really except for some charity for college dealing with golf.
[00:48:46.969 --> 00:48:49.830]  He thinks it's a moral thing that he's not involved.
[00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:56.072]  He thinks it's like a good thing, and the corporations just worship him because he is cold-blooded.
[00:48:56.492 --> 00:49:08.976]  And I can't imagine having a hundred million dollars a year based on people dying of diseases in sweatshops, in these horrible malaria-infested camps, and maquiladoras.
[00:49:09.036 --> 00:49:11.016]  I mean, and I'm not some goody-two-shoe.
[00:49:11.296 --> 00:49:13.257]  I mean, I'm a pretty hard-nosed guy, but yeah,
[00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:16.541]  Tiger Woods could become a mega icon.
[00:49:16.581 --> 00:49:18.203]  His life would have real value.
[00:49:18.563 --> 00:49:21.727]  Instead, it's this hollow crap of hitting a golf ball.
[00:49:21.747 --> 00:49:22.568]  You're absolutely right, John.
[00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:23.109]  It's sickening.
[00:49:23.409 --> 00:49:24.671]  Well, yeah.
[00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:27.094]  Ultimately, who buys the magazines?
[00:49:27.674 --> 00:49:28.615]  Who buys into this?
[00:49:28.816 --> 00:49:30.298]  Who watches it on television?
[00:49:30.358 --> 00:49:30.718]  We do.
[00:49:31.724 --> 00:49:35.247]  So it's time that we stop doing that.
[00:49:35.287 --> 00:49:37.009]  It's time that we took back control.
[00:49:37.029 --> 00:49:45.056]  And this is where it really belongs, Alexis, is that we, the people, have to recognize that we have responsibilities.
[00:49:45.797 --> 00:49:57.021]  And if we want a country of, by, and for the people, instead of one that's of, by, and for the elite, the corporations, etc., we've got to get off our butts and do something about it.
[00:49:57.061 --> 00:50:05.044]  I think that's what you're calling for all the time, so it's one of the reasons I love being on your show, because you're inspiring and empowering people to do that.
[00:50:05.084 --> 00:50:09.746]  We need to do it more and more and more, because it's always been the way that change has happened.
[00:50:10.163 --> 00:50:13.164]  I agree, but John, what would you call that corporate attitude?
[00:50:13.204 --> 00:50:14.164]  I don't know the word for it.
[00:50:14.465 --> 00:50:19.966]  Where they get off on being cold-blooded, they get off on not caring, they think it's silly.
[00:50:19.986 --> 00:50:24.208]  I mean, that's a very... That's sociopathic.
[00:50:25.393 --> 00:50:26.454]  Yeah, sociopathic.
[00:50:26.694 --> 00:50:35.904]  And you know, I think that at the top of a number of our corporations, we do have sociopath people who have basically no conscience, that don't care about what harm they bring to others.
[00:50:35.964 --> 00:50:41.169]  I think Jack Welch was a person like that, and I think Bill Nye at Nike is.
[00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:47.396]  But throughout the rest of the corporation, most of the other managers and people are not, and those are the ones we need to get to.
[00:50:48.868 --> 00:50:55.814]  Well, absolutely, but I mean, also we destroy our own world, not just environmentally, but culturally.
[00:50:55.834 --> 00:51:08.366]  This attitude, I see the local yuppies mimic it, and they're into laughing at bad things happening, as if it doesn't touch them, when their kids are going to end up committing suicide or on drugs in this sick society.
[00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:18.173]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:52:09.634 --> 00:52:14.959]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:22.527]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:23.048 --> 00:52:29.194]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:29.614 --> 00:52:31.455]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:31.595 --> 00:52:34.017]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:34.097 --> 00:52:45.044]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:45.665 --> 00:52:46.965]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:47.346 --> 00:52:48.726]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:49.207 --> 00:52:55.451]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:05.526]  The Obama Deception.
[00:53:05.946 --> 00:53:07.227]  The people strike back.
[00:53:08.907 --> 00:53:12.528]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:53:12.668 --> 00:53:22.670]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.831]  There is a solution that doesn't involve
[00:53:24.991 --> 00:53:30.055]  If you notice that most times here are these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[00:53:30.075 --> 00:53:36.381]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[00:53:36.441 --> 00:53:37.642]  Using something that is natural,
[00:53:53.735 --> 00:53:58.299]  That is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.

[00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:28.168]  Me and John were just talking about all the websites and groups we can find out about the sweatshop free clothes and products that are becoming more and more popular.
[00:54:28.889 --> 00:54:31.751]  And it's those little choices that you think are little that really add up.
[00:54:32.753 --> 00:54:33.734]  Uh, to big things.
[00:54:34.756 --> 00:54:39.023]  And then I hear these arguments about, oh, if there's not a sweatshop, they wouldn't have any job.
[00:54:39.063 --> 00:54:39.284]  No.
[00:54:39.684 --> 00:54:42.209]  In every study I've seen, and Ross Perot covered this in the mid-90s,
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.282]  It made the standard of living in Mexico go down.
[00:54:46.362 --> 00:54:48.183]  Standard of living in Brazil go down.
[00:54:48.563 --> 00:54:50.345]  Standard of living in Indonesia go down.
[00:54:50.685 --> 00:54:51.726]  It makes it go down.
[00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:53.307]  It does not make it go up.
[00:54:53.367 --> 00:54:54.868]  And it makes our standard go down.
[00:54:55.288 --> 00:54:59.491]  It's just, this globalization, the way they're doing it is killing everything.
[00:54:59.892 --> 00:55:02.594]  Rusty in Texas, you're on the air with John Perkins.
[00:55:02.634 --> 00:55:02.974]  Go ahead.
[00:55:06.359 --> 00:55:06.700]  Hello?
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:07.660]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.281]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:08.361 --> 00:55:09.521]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:55:10.082 --> 00:55:16.946]  I just took Texas government this last year and they talked about this thing called creative destruction.
[00:55:17.887 --> 00:55:29.174]  And creative destruction is supposed to be like a business gets so big that eventually it collapses within itself and goes broke.
[00:55:29.194 --> 00:55:33.017]  Or the people quit buying the products because they just get tired of it.
[00:55:33.823 --> 00:55:40.609]  But I don't see how it can be fair to go and bail these companies out, basically giving them a new deal.
[00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:51.399]  Because capitalism itself is like a live and let die kind of way of living, you know, because one man's loss is another man's gain.
[00:55:51.439 --> 00:55:51.839]  No, I hear you.
[00:55:51.859 --> 00:55:54.581]  Let me get a quick comment from John Perkins, and I would just briefly say,
[00:55:55.529 --> 00:56:03.211]  This is crony capitalism, and it's been said many times, where the risk is socialized, the profit is privatized.
[00:56:03.571 --> 00:56:06.972]  So it's not really capitalism, John Perkins.
[00:56:07.133 --> 00:56:08.493]  Yeah, no, I totally agree with you.
[00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:17.376]  That's why I say it's what I'm calling a mutant form of capitalism, where it's all balanced in favor of a few very, very wealthy and powerful people.
[00:56:18.736 --> 00:56:20.777]  But we need to turn that around, and we can do that.
[00:56:21.757 --> 00:56:24.078]  It's like going to a casino where you never win.
[00:56:24.138 --> 00:56:25.158]  It's totally rigged.
[00:56:25.629 --> 00:56:26.490]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:29.491]  But only because we allow it to be rigged.
[00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:30.192]  We can stop it.
[00:56:30.212 --> 00:56:32.974]  I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but we can do it.
[00:56:33.894 --> 00:56:38.957]  Well, we better, because they're just feeding the whole world into their debt black hole.
[00:56:39.398 --> 00:56:40.398]  Ronnie in Texas.
[00:56:40.438 --> 00:56:41.759]  Go ahead, you're on the air with John Perkins.
[00:56:42.119 --> 00:56:42.860]  Upcoming book?
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.561]  Hoodwinked.
[00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:44.981]  Go ahead.
[00:56:45.381 --> 00:56:49.824]  Perkins, I lived for nine months in poverty-ridden Peru under U.S.
[00:56:49.844 --> 00:56:54.627]  puppet Toledo, and it dawned on me there that would not absolute freedom, and I'm asking you,
[00:56:55.302 --> 00:56:57.523]  Absolute freedom worldwide for farmers.
[00:56:57.643 --> 00:57:08.845]  Help cancel all continually counterproductive wars on behalf of illegal drug warlords that we're waging in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Afghanistan, all over the world.
[00:57:08.865 --> 00:57:10.765]  You're asking how is the phony drug war?
[00:57:11.086 --> 00:57:19.287]  Well, I loved watching General Myers on TV last night explain how the occupation made the opium production go way up.
[00:57:19.527 --> 00:57:21.488]  That's a good final comment from John Perkins.
[00:57:21.508 --> 00:57:21.728]  John?
[00:57:22.458 --> 00:57:27.281]  Yeah, I mean the farmers around the world have really been hit hard.
[00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:31.343]  They've been hit hard by what we call free trade agreements.
[00:57:32.163 --> 00:57:37.966]  It's absurd today that a Mexican farmer can produce cotton a lot more cheaply than a U.S.
[00:57:38.026 --> 00:57:38.427]  farmer.
[00:57:38.887 --> 00:57:39.908]  But you can buy U.S.
[00:57:39.948 --> 00:57:50.173]  produced cotton in Mexico for a lot less of a price than Mexican cotton simply because it's so subsidized in the United States for the big industries.
[00:57:50.253 --> 00:57:51.694]  And this has hurt the small farmer.
[00:57:52.125 --> 00:57:58.870]  Time and time again, whether it's cotton, or corn, or soybeans, or whatever it is, the small farmer has been very, very screwed.
[00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:04.054]  And a lot of these people are now what we call terrorists, because they've lost their farms.
[00:58:04.094 --> 00:58:05.755]  They have no way of feeding their family.
[00:58:06.235 --> 00:58:10.858]  And so they become part of organizations that are fanatical, because they don't know what else to do.
[00:58:11.519 --> 00:58:15.141]  Yeah, in Mexico, they'll just let you go die.
[00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:18.424]  In Mexico City, just die in your hut.
[00:58:18.984 --> 00:58:20.025]  No welfare system.
[00:58:22.222 --> 00:58:22.943]  It's just hellish.
[00:58:23.063 --> 00:58:29.908]  Well, the new book's coming out, and we're going to interview you the day after it comes out, November 11th, coming up in a month and a half or so.
[00:58:30.828 --> 00:58:34.631]  John Perkins, best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:58:34.951 --> 00:58:36.032]  It was great having you on.
[00:58:36.072 --> 00:58:37.653]  We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[00:58:37.854 --> 00:58:38.874]  My pleasure, Alex.
[00:58:38.934 --> 00:58:39.795]  Keep up your good work.
[00:58:40.315 --> 00:58:40.676]  You too.
[00:58:40.716 --> 00:58:41.977]  Appreciate you being on with us.

[00:58:58.274 --> 00:59:03.437]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:59:03.577 --> 00:59:07.940]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.961]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:11.742]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:12.002 --> 00:59:13.043]  There is a solution.
[00:59:13.263 --> 00:59:21.290]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.218]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:03.698 --> 01:00:06.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:25.634]  Alright, I'm going to go to Lee and Steve and others and take some calls.
[01:00:25.774 --> 01:00:28.777]  I've got to reset here.
[01:00:32.561 --> 01:00:37.486]  And get ready to go over media propaganda.
[01:00:37.506 --> 01:00:38.787]  Again, I say I'm frustrated.
[01:00:38.807 --> 01:00:39.928]  There's no way to cover it all.
[01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:43.031]  The federal government in the last six, seven years
[01:00:44.972 --> 01:00:50.433]  In Australia, in England, in Germany, in Canada, in the U.S.
[01:00:50.453 --> 01:00:56.894]  Because our federal government is run by the same big think tanks, the same Council on Foreign Relations that every nation has.
[01:00:57.475 --> 01:01:02.896]  Every western nation has a Council on Foreign Relations roundtable group that is the real government.
[01:01:03.696 --> 01:01:04.696]  And they even brag about it.
[01:01:04.736 --> 01:01:07.457]  I mean, I've played clips of Hillary and others admitting it on TV.
[01:01:07.517 --> 01:01:09.317]  I mean, these are some arrogant bastards.
[01:01:10.337 --> 01:01:13.438]  And so when I see a headline, State Law Changes
[01:01:14.494 --> 01:01:17.676]  Way police draws blood from suspected drunk drivers.
[01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:21.539]  When I see an article like that, I know the whole background of this.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.602]  The average person, I'm not saying I'm smart, I study this.
[01:01:26.122 --> 01:01:27.323]  The average person goes, oh.
[01:01:30.725 --> 01:01:39.011]  So see, we've had police taking blood illegally from people so long, that now,
[01:01:41.004 --> 01:01:44.725]  They get to frame the articles about, oh, we're changing the way we take your blood now.
[01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:52.228]  And this is so invasive.
[01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.588]  It's totally federal.
[01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:54.489]  It's international.
[01:01:54.529 --> 01:01:58.170]  It's about training you to submit for global DNA databases.
[01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:59.771]  I'm going to break it down at the 20 after.
[01:01:59.791 --> 01:02:02.732]  Then I'm getting into the CNN fake newscast video.
[01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:03.432]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:02:04.212 --> 01:02:07.573]  We'll go over the audio on air for the radio audience for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.214]  It'll be particularly revealing.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.781]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:02:12.881 --> 01:02:14.303]  Lee in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:14.963]  Go ahead, Lee.
[01:02:16.184 --> 01:02:17.205]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:17.705]  How you doing?
[01:02:18.366 --> 01:02:19.207]  I'm doing all right.
[01:02:20.628 --> 01:02:26.833]  I was hoping to get some perspective from John there, but sorry, I missed him.
[01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:29.315]  But I've actually been a listener for years.
[01:02:29.856 --> 01:02:32.918]  I've been aware of the agenda for about 10 years.
[01:02:32.979 --> 01:02:35.621]  I'm 25 years old, a veteran of the United States Navy.
[01:02:37.606 --> 01:02:43.987]  Actually happy to be out of uniform now and be able to speak and actually have a voice for the people and myself and my family.
[01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:48.148]  And I actually run a website, the Freedom Informant Network.
[01:02:48.448 --> 01:02:49.608]  We kind of spawned out of YouTube.
[01:02:49.688 --> 01:02:50.688]  It's a Patriot community.
[01:02:51.749 --> 01:03:01.110]  And you've been talking a lot lately, you know, how do we address the swine flu pandemic issues, you know, all the threats that we're facing here rather soon.
[01:03:01.931 --> 01:03:04.231]  And it actually was an idea I had last week
[01:03:05.387 --> 01:03:13.659]  We expanded on the idea, launched some videos, put the information on the website to launch a global campaign for 9-11-09.
[01:03:14.219 --> 01:03:17.825]  And I apologize, I don't speak on the radio often, so my nerves are getting to me here.
[01:03:19.811 --> 01:03:21.693]  9-11-09 rocks the planet.
[01:03:22.073 --> 01:03:29.499]  We're trying to rally people across the world, every city, every town across the nation and the world.
[01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.580]  Get the people in the streets.
[01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:45.633]  We've seen a rise of interest and with that interest we've also seen hijacking by the media and demonization of the media and we'd like to get the people out there at a simultaneous time starting noon Eastern Standard Time, 11 a.m.
[01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:46.574]  Central Standard Time.
[01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:47.614]  That's good.
[01:03:47.634 --> 01:03:48.634]  That's exciting.
[01:03:48.654 --> 01:03:49.355]  Send me some info on it.
[01:03:49.375 --> 01:03:52.955]  Look, I'm calling on everybody to start their own website, start their own groups, and promote it.
[01:04:09.171 --> 01:04:15.977]  And even with my huge audience, I'm not trying to launch some simultaneous or organized, coordinated thing.
[01:04:16.638 --> 01:04:17.539]  What's had success?
[01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:18.880]  Our poster contest.
[01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:21.482]  People are emailing, calling, videos.
[01:04:22.143 --> 01:04:27.068]  The Joker posters, the contest is over, but it's only intensifying with InfoWars.com.
[01:04:27.508 --> 01:04:29.910]  Then they come to InfoWars.com, they find out the truth.
[01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:31.271]  I've launched a new
[01:04:32.492 --> 01:04:32.612]  We're
[01:04:51.531 --> 01:04:52.653]  All the groups, it's good.
[01:04:52.813 --> 01:04:55.358]  Everybody go out, do something, be heard, be involved.
[01:04:56.019 --> 01:05:01.147]  That's the one thing I disagreed with Perkins on big time earlier was that people are anti-healthcare, that that's all staged.
[01:05:01.808 --> 01:05:03.652]  But see, he comes from a left perspective.
[01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:04.753]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:09.745 --> 01:05:14.747]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:14.947 --> 01:05:18.748]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:18.988 --> 01:05:24.589]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:24.869 --> 01:05:29.751]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:29.951 --> 01:05:30.451]  Number three,
[01:05:30.871 --> 01:05:36.313]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:37.153 --> 01:05:39.794]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:40.054 --> 01:05:43.475]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:44.575 --> 01:05:48.176]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:53.918]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:05:54.139 --> 01:05:58.721]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:00.401]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:02.962]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:06:03.182 --> 01:06:05.824]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:06:09.619 --> 01:06:10.720]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.781]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:13.601]  Well, you should.
[01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:18.223]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:06:18.464 --> 01:06:18.944]  That's right.
[01:06:19.264 --> 01:06:29.189]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:32.451]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free
[01:06:32.791 --> 01:06:36.274]  Springfield Armory XD Pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:06:36.614 --> 01:06:43.139]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.724]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:06:49.044 --> 01:06:50.185]  This is real.
[01:06:50.505 --> 01:06:51.246]  Don't miss out.
[01:06:51.566 --> 01:06:59.933]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[01:07:09.137 --> 01:07:11.798]  Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:17.180]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.260]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:24.402]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:25.162]  How much do you
[01:07:25.162 --> 01:07:25.242]  Yeah.
[01:07:41.937 --> 01:07:42.177]  We're good.
[01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:11.936]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:12.517 --> 01:08:16.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.762 --> 01:08:21.266]  We've got one of the headlines up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:21.326 --> 01:08:25.130]  Authorities prepare to seize kids during swine flu pandemic.
[01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:26.351]  That's up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:27.772 --> 01:08:29.812]  We broke this back on August 6th.
[01:08:29.832 --> 01:08:31.393]  It's finally gotten some attention.
[01:08:31.413 --> 01:08:36.135]  Paul Watson's written a more detailed article now up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:50.721]  If you go to InfoWars.com and click on a big banner halfway down that says the poster revolution and we'll put that up on screen for folks at PrisonPlanet.tv in a moment.
[01:08:51.977 --> 01:08:54.939]  And it goes over the new poster revolution.
[01:08:54.959 --> 01:08:58.340]  Infowars is launching a new contest.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.261]  Let me read that to folks.
[01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:06.345]  Infowars is launching a new political poster contest following the viral success of the Obama Joker campaign.
[01:09:07.605 --> 01:09:14.469]  The posters can be related to any subject you like, whether it be swine flu vaccine, fluoride in the water,
[01:09:15.543 --> 01:09:20.910]  Police brutality, genetically modified food, or the man-made global warming hoax.
[01:09:21.531 --> 01:09:29.802]  Pick any issue you like, make a poster, and then film yourself posting it in public and upload the video to YouTube or similar website.
[01:09:30.643 --> 01:09:37.125]  Posters should be posted in public commons with other flyers, public announcements, handbills, etc.
[01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:37.666]  posted.
[01:09:37.686 --> 01:09:51.951]  Please do not post on federal property as this will be considered vandalism and they'll get the nanny around and whine and cry to themselves and will be counterproductive and diminish the message because the criminals that run things will pose as victims.
[01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:57.476]  The poster must include InfoWars or PrisonPlanet.com somewhere on the design.
[01:09:57.876 --> 01:10:01.679]  Prizes will be given to 1st and 2nd and 3rd place winners.
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:06.184]  The most dynamic, hard-hitting artist entries will take the prize.
[01:10:06.404 --> 01:10:09.847]  1,000 1st place, 500 2nd place, 3rd place 200.
[01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:13.370]  Send your poster artwork to contests at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:13.871 --> 01:10:16.513]  Post on the web and send us the address.
[01:10:16.893 --> 01:10:17.994]  The contest runs for
[01:10:18.695 --> 01:10:22.457]  Two weeks from Friday, August 21st until Friday, September 4th.
[01:10:22.477 --> 01:10:23.878]  YouTube's the best place to post it.
[01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:25.819]  As a video.
[01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:26.899]  Very, very easy.
[01:10:26.999 --> 01:10:30.721]  And we're also going on this page to have a link to a page that has a different poster art up there.
[01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:32.782]  Janae Meadows, our great...
[01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:41.359]  Graphics lady, one of our great graphics people, she made a great one, kind of a variant of the David Dees snake with fangs dealing with the flu.
[01:10:42.541 --> 01:10:48.610]  Let's go ahead and get that posted and ask Kurt Nemo to get, ask Derek to have Nemo post that.
[01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:50.452]  I saw those this morning.
[01:10:51.602 --> 01:10:53.262]  And you can also see the winners there.
[01:10:53.342 --> 01:10:57.143]  San Francisco, Bay Area, first place.
[01:10:57.863 --> 01:10:59.444]  Wall Street, number two.
[01:10:59.944 --> 01:11:01.844]  Minnesota, number three.
[01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.804]  And I was supposed to do an honorable mention.
[01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:04.445]  I forgot to do that.
[01:11:04.465 --> 01:11:06.365]  People reminded me that artwork's around here somewhere.
[01:11:06.725 --> 01:11:09.426]  I put a Hitler mustache on the Obama poster.
[01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:15.847]  Really, it was a joke, but I guess I said I would be honorable mention, so I better mail that out to somebody, that original Alex Jones artwork.
[01:11:17.418 --> 01:11:18.058]  Pretty ridiculous.
[01:11:18.578 --> 01:11:28.260]  But the whole issue here is there is now other TV stations saying it's a hate crime and I should be arrested, and that talking bad about Obama is a crime.
[01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:32.001]  We have those videos linked up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.302]  Steve Watson's done a story.
[01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:42.144]  And anybody who ever doubted these hate crimes legislation, that they really do plan with the cyberbullying and the rest of it to arrest you for your speech, here's the proof.
[01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.224]  I mean, these people mean business.
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:47.582]  And so we stand up to them and say no to them or it's over.
[01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:50.103]  And a lot of you have all these great ideas.
[01:11:50.503 --> 01:12:00.948]  You know, a Joker picture of Obama with two injectors under him, two needles under him, like a skull and crossbones, with him wearing the old-fashioned doctor mirror.
[01:12:01.288 --> 01:12:02.989]  You know, the doctor light on his head.
[01:12:03.009 --> 01:12:04.150]  That'd be good.
[01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:07.551]  A Joker with that on his head, with two syringes under him as an axe.
[01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:09.092]  My uncle called.
[01:12:09.752 --> 01:12:12.914]  He's a good graphics guy in his own right.
[01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:17.407]  I mean, as a hobby, but he's a great artist.
[01:12:17.887 --> 01:12:19.488]  He ought to make that poster and send it to me.
[01:12:19.528 --> 01:12:25.232]  We'd get it up, but... The point is, there's a lot of different ideas.
[01:12:25.673 --> 01:12:29.035]  We'll get them all up on the site, but regardless, get them up on YouTube.
[01:12:29.716 --> 01:12:36.280]  And the idea now is, everybody saw, I figured we could make this poster big because of the iconic imagery.
[01:12:38.522 --> 01:12:40.023]  But people said, hey, I got a better idea.
[01:12:40.283 --> 01:12:40.644]  Great!
[01:12:41.744 --> 01:12:42.845]  Let us see your idea.
[01:12:42.985 --> 01:12:43.565]  Put it out.
[01:12:43.945 --> 01:12:44.805]  Get it out there.
[01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:50.088]  Withinfowars.com or prisonplanet.com, either or both, on the image.
[01:12:50.128 --> 01:12:51.088]  That's the only rule.
[01:12:51.989 --> 01:12:54.490]  Please try to stick to your local rules and laws.
[01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:55.650]  Whatever.
[01:12:56.051 --> 01:12:56.791]  First Amendment.
[01:12:57.131 --> 01:12:57.891]  Get out there.
[01:12:58.272 --> 01:12:58.612]  Do it.
[01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:01.333]  I want to start seeing these on YouTube.
[01:13:01.373 --> 01:13:02.413]  We want to start posting them.
[01:13:03.154 --> 01:13:09.737]  And we need to create, I guess, a master page that has the old Obama contest winners, the new ones that are coming in,
[01:13:11.089 --> 01:13:11.710]  Who made this?
[01:13:13.551 --> 01:13:15.673]  Douglas in our office made this, but obviously he can't win.
[01:13:16.133 --> 01:13:18.315]  It's Obama as Hitler!
[01:13:18.896 --> 01:13:19.697]  Mein Kampf!
[01:13:20.297 --> 01:13:21.398]  And he's not our God.
[01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:28.824]  The mere fact they're saying that it's illegal to criticize him now and that it's hate speech and I should be arrested is the whole reason we're doing this.
[01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:36.831]  I never did this with Bush because people were making him a monkey and making him a Nazi and making him Hitler and making him...
[01:13:38.326 --> 01:13:43.090]  A vampire, and a goblin, and a joker, and nobody ever said it was illegal.
[01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.872]  I was no fan of Bush, and we lampooned him.
[01:13:46.252 --> 01:13:53.318]  But when they said three weeks ago, it's illegal, we need to arrest whoever's criticizing the president, I said, okay, let's go big time with this.
[01:13:54.299 --> 01:13:55.760]  So yeah, let's post this one too.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.826]  Let's give this to Kurt to post along with the no vaccine, vaccine kills posters.
[01:14:04.267 --> 01:14:05.067]  Just ideas.
[01:14:06.016 --> 01:14:08.398]  We're not saying post ours in the contest.
[01:14:08.418 --> 01:14:09.159]  It needs to be yours.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.161]  We're just putting examples up.
[01:14:13.143 --> 01:14:14.745]  And I'm reading the comments from...
[01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:23.211]  Texas, I'm reading the comments from New York, I'm reading the comments everywhere where they're saying arrest people in the news.
[01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:25.632]  Everybody's commenting saying, are you kidding?
[01:14:26.073 --> 01:14:31.656]  I'm gonna do this ten times more, or I'm gonna go out and, you know, with solidarity with the culprit.
[01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:33.137]  I mean, whatever!
[01:14:33.257 --> 01:14:36.139]  Just let them know you don't want the socialist healthcare.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.701]  Let them know you don't want cap and trade.
[01:14:39.001 --> 01:14:40.883]  Let them know you don't want their New World Order.
[01:14:41.223 --> 01:14:44.165]  Let them know, let them know that we don't want their chemtrails.
[01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:49.392]  I mean, let's just get it going here.
[01:14:49.412 --> 01:14:54.276]  Let's take another call and I'm going to get into all these video clips that are coming up.
[01:14:56.498 --> 01:14:58.279]  Alistair in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.281]  Alex, how are you?
[01:15:00.661 --> 01:15:00.901]  Good.
[01:15:01.662 --> 01:15:03.824]  Hey, thanks so much for all the work you've been doing.
[01:15:03.904 --> 01:15:07.687]  I mean, I've been listening to you for over a course of a few years, but more
[01:15:08.095 --> 01:15:19.460]  Recently in the last eight or nine months and I just want to thank you for all the great information that you're putting out there and really getting the word out to so many people.
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:25.182]  I've taken a lot of your advice and a lot of my own ideas and I've gone right ahead and
[01:15:25.566 --> 01:15:36.510]  And try to, you know, get more people involved and understand the issues, because for the most part, people out there, they're just not in tune with what's actually going on.
[01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:46.994]  I mean, they're completely under the spell of the media and being manipulated into all sorts of different horrible things, which you talk about all the time.
[01:15:47.295 --> 01:15:51.036]  And, I mean, what you do is just a real great service.
[01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:53.517]  And, you know, I want to thank you.
[01:15:54.236 --> 01:16:04.343]  And as far as, like, you know, websites and things that people have going on out there, for the word, I mean, it is hard to sift through so much information.
[01:16:04.923 --> 01:16:08.205]  If you don't mind, I'd like to plug one site that I'm involved with.
[01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:09.767]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:16:10.447 --> 01:16:23.436]  Yeah, my father's actually an author, and he has been writing books on the issues in which that you speak about in many cases for a number of years now, and the site is
[01:16:24.518 --> 01:16:28.501]  I like people doing plugs, but those are the die-hard callers.
[01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:30.382]  And then every caller, it's just a plug.
[01:16:30.422 --> 01:16:32.043]  And then it's not ever about the issues.
[01:16:32.063 --> 01:16:32.544]  They always thank me.
[01:16:45.131 --> 01:16:47.813]  What I like is somebody talking about an issue, a news story.
[01:16:48.133 --> 01:16:50.655]  Yeah, look at how they're going to take our blood at checkpoints now.
[01:16:51.175 --> 01:16:52.716]  And then, oh, by the way, here's my website.
[01:16:52.776 --> 01:16:53.797]  But great, man.
[01:16:54.357 --> 01:16:55.598]  That's good, Alistair.
[01:16:55.618 --> 01:16:56.439]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:57.159 --> 01:16:58.340]  Earl in Texas.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:58.901]  You're on the air.
[01:16:58.941 --> 01:16:59.381]  Go ahead.
[01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:01.302]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:01.322 --> 01:17:01.863]  How you doing?
[01:17:02.263 --> 01:17:02.523]  Good.
[01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:11.089]  Listen, I have sent you a flyer that I received from a friend of mine about the H1N1 virus.
[01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:13.351]  They were having a
[01:17:14.941 --> 01:17:16.983]  Meeting in Washington D.C.
[01:17:17.043 --> 01:17:18.945]  and they were trying to educate people on it.
[01:17:19.726 --> 01:17:27.714]  The only education they need to know is that I will not stand for my daughter or any of my family to have this shot.
[01:17:28.775 --> 01:17:31.338]  That's the only education they need to know about it.
[01:17:32.011 --> 01:17:50.807]  That's right, in these federal training manuals and documents, forced inoculation, quarantines, lockdowns of cities, taking your children from you, and even if they don't get away with it this time, if we fight them hard, it's about testing federal, and then the feds render you in control under level 6.
[01:17:51.568 --> 01:17:57.853]  So it's all about drilling everybody to accept this, and all about federalization.
[01:18:00.035 --> 01:18:01.696]  All we can do is continue to expose them.
[01:18:01.997 --> 01:18:07.100]  The good news is their plan to fearmonger and hype everybody into taking these shots isn't going well.
[01:18:08.321 --> 01:18:18.588]  Well, I've already told my 16-year-old daughter if they try and force her to take this vaccine at her school, she is not to take it.
[01:18:18.628 --> 01:18:22.451]  She is to call me and then I will report right straight to the principal.
[01:18:24.704 --> 01:18:25.444]  Well, that's good.
[01:18:25.864 --> 01:18:31.346]  But again, a lot of this is the system has been brainwashing and saying it's the law, you've got to take shots for school.
[01:18:31.886 --> 01:18:36.488]  And then now I notice the news is having to say at the bottom of the article, unless you get a waiver.
[01:18:37.148 --> 01:18:38.629]  See, before they wouldn't even say that.
[01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:44.771]  So we're forcing these criminals out into the open now and exposing what they've been doing.
[01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:45.671]  I mean, even if you're for
[01:18:46.371 --> 01:18:48.432]  Being injected with hundreds of different shots a year.
[01:18:49.093 --> 01:18:51.995]  The point is that they shouldn't lie about it and say it's the law.
[01:18:52.415 --> 01:18:55.937]  Now, under pandemic, they're trying to have a vaccine that actually is the law.
[01:18:56.518 --> 01:19:00.460]  But they've had laws, you know, saying black people weren't humans.
[01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:04.323]  So you don't have to follow the law that is unconstitutional and criminal.
[01:19:04.783 --> 01:19:06.965]  I mean, they can say you've got to lick police boots.
[01:19:07.765 --> 01:19:08.386]  It's the law.
[01:19:08.446 --> 01:19:09.607]  You don't have to lick their boots.
[01:19:10.127 --> 01:19:14.110]  Anybody that tries to stick their boot in your mouth, well, you can stand up against them.
[01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:18.032]  And that's the essence of this, but it's good to hear from you, Earl.
[01:19:18.432 --> 01:19:19.373]  Chris in Ohio.
[01:19:19.413 --> 01:19:20.233]  Well, we gotta go to break.
[01:19:20.814 --> 01:19:29.800]  What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come back, get into this newscast about the police forcibly taking your blood all around the country and the world, but right here where I live in Austin.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.861]  And see, it's about now, oh, you're not gonna give me blood?
[01:19:32.922 --> 01:19:33.822]  I'm gonna taser you.
[01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:41.087]  And they've already had court rulings where you don't roll your sleeve up, they taser you as torture, paying compliance till you do it.
[01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:44.844]  And everybody's going to have their blood taken.
[01:19:45.184 --> 01:19:48.626]  This is getting you ready under the executive order signed by Clinton.
[01:19:48.866 --> 01:19:50.407]  It's in my first film, made in 97.
[01:19:50.447 --> 01:19:56.790]  They already have it on the books to forcibly take blood, urine, and other tissue samples when you get a driver's license.
[01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:03.794]  It's all part of the new WorldID DNA biometric database.
[01:20:04.414 --> 01:20:06.855]  That's what this is all about.
[01:20:07.175 --> 01:20:07.896]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:08.763 --> 01:20:10.264]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:20:10.444 --> 01:20:11.905]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:20:12.205 --> 01:20:14.426]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:20:14.887 --> 01:20:19.630]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[01:21:09.309 --> 01:21:14.634]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:15.134 --> 01:21:22.221]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:22.721 --> 01:21:28.887]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:29.307 --> 01:21:31.129]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:31.269 --> 01:21:33.691]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:33.771 --> 01:21:44.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:45.361 --> 01:21:46.642]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:47.042 --> 01:21:48.383]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:48.884 --> 01:21:55.149]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:55.790 --> 01:22:03.566]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:04.067 --> 01:22:05.229]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.832]  The people strike back!
[01:22:09.022 --> 01:22:09.363]  G'day!
[01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:11.064]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:11.325 --> 01:22:11.625]  August 24th, 2009.
[01:22:11.665 --> 01:22:12.646]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5660.
[01:22:12.686 --> 01:22:16.030]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.8389, $4.9195 for a half-ounce, or $2.4597 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.651]  That's $9.8389, $4.9195, or $2.4597.
[01:22:28.613 --> 01:22:42.156]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:42.216 --> 01:22:43.257]  Is this capitalism?
[01:22:43.457 --> 01:22:50.859]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:51.059 --> 01:22:52.039]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:56.300]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.542]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.602 --> 01:22:58.805]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:58.865 --> 01:22:59.185]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.245 --> 01:22:59.686]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:08.832 --> 01:23:16.417]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[01:23:16.597 --> 01:23:21.479]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:27.203]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[01:23:27.483 --> 01:23:32.025]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:23:32.145 --> 01:23:34.146]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:23:34.286 --> 01:23:35.907]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:23:36.127 --> 01:23:38.389]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:23:38.589 --> 01:23:40.089]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:44.512]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[01:23:44.732 --> 01:23:47.093]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman.
[01:23:47.253 --> 01:23:47.493]  I think so.
[01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:12.952]  Okay, here's the big pitch.
[01:24:28.746 --> 01:24:34.790]  All over the world in the last six, seven years, I've seen the British governments where it started, then Canada, then the U.S.
[01:24:35.991 --> 01:24:39.914]  Federal governments, all under international standardization, want your blood.
[01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.056]  And in England, they're honest about it.
[01:24:42.096 --> 01:24:46.099]  They said, we're going to start taking tissue swabs out of the cheek.
[01:24:46.379 --> 01:24:50.182]  Those are some of the largest and easiest to remove DNA samples.
[01:24:51.002 --> 01:24:56.824]  So if you're stopped for speeding or for questioning, in England they randomly take your DNA.
[01:24:57.164 --> 01:25:02.846]  They're now doing it on street corners, they have mobile vans, they just snatch you and pull you in, no judge, no jury.
[01:25:03.186 --> 01:25:05.787]  They're getting rid of Magna Carta, getting rid of due process.
[01:25:07.568 --> 01:25:14.390]  Now all over the United States, and we've had Police Chief Art Acevedo in the seat, he admits
[01:25:15.638 --> 01:25:19.030]  Most police chiefs laugh at this, because they know the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:25:19.351 --> 01:25:20.455]  He admits it's a federal grant.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:30.645]  The feds are paying to have the local police with these fake warrants, and we've had the head of the Texas Bar on, and we've had judges on, it's on record.
[01:25:31.145 --> 01:25:33.926]  It's these fake master warrants the judge swears out.
[01:25:34.367 --> 01:25:35.067]  They're a fraud.
[01:25:35.727 --> 01:25:41.390]  And at mobile vans, mobile RVs, they take your blood on the side of the highway.
[01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:45.592]  Now I would tell people about this six years ago in Phoenix and in Denver.
[01:25:46.272 --> 01:25:48.774]  And I'd have the news articles and people couldn't believe it.
[01:25:49.685 --> 01:25:58.652]  I used to get calls, it would just be radio, I'd say, here's the Denver Post, here's the Phoenix, here's the Tucson Star, people didn't believe it.
[01:25:59.913 --> 01:26:02.175]  That's how in denial people were five years ago.
[01:26:02.635 --> 01:26:05.678]  Now they go, oh yeah, it's good, take my blood at checkpoints.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.063]  So it gets worse and worse and worse, and now they're just saying,
[01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:14.691]  Well, let's go ahead and play the news.
[01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:21.173]  See, first they start it, now they're expanding it, and because it was illegal, the state's trying to weigh in to make it legal.
[01:26:21.454 --> 01:26:26.216]  Kind of like, oh, warrantless wiretapping's illegal, but we're going to pass a law federally so it'll be legal.
[01:26:26.476 --> 01:26:27.476]  It's still a load of crap.
[01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:33.399]  You can pass a law saying we've all got to pull plow shares and you can beat us on the back with cat-or-nine-tails.
[01:26:33.459 --> 01:26:34.079]  It's a fraud!
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.760]  You can pass a law saying there's no Second Amendment.
[01:26:37.021 --> 01:26:37.641]  It's a fraud!
[01:26:38.783 --> 01:26:39.604]  You understand that?
[01:26:39.704 --> 01:26:42.045]  That's what the Declaration of Independence says, punks.
[01:26:42.565 --> 01:26:43.666]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[01:26:57.677 --> 01:27:07.807]  Tyler, starting September the 1st, police across Texas won't need a search warrant to draw blood from people involved in one of three situations after a crash.
[01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:17.236]  Number one, if you injure someone in that crash, or number two, if you have prior DWIs, or number three, if you have a child in your car at the time of the crash.
[01:27:17.596 --> 01:27:20.519]  So in other words, blood... That's how tyranny works!
[01:27:21.949 --> 01:27:30.676]  See, first the Feds say, we're going to pay you to do these with fake warrants, master rubber stamp warrants, just a master warrant.
[01:27:32.058 --> 01:27:33.959]  Just like with the national wiretapping.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.883]  Then they just go, you know what, it's for children, we're getting rid of all of it.
[01:27:39.524 --> 01:27:41.145]  See, oh, it's for the children!
[01:27:42.099 --> 01:27:45.861]  Meanwhile, they admit texting while driving is twice as bad as drinking while driving.
[01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:47.702]  But don't worry, they're going to arrest you for that, too.
[01:27:48.082 --> 01:27:49.843]  They want to stick stuff in your body.
[01:27:50.123 --> 01:27:52.524]  They want the precedent, because they're eugenicsists.
[01:27:52.544 --> 01:27:53.764]  They're already putting it in your water.
[01:27:54.184 --> 01:27:55.745]  White House science czar admits it.
[01:27:57.146 --> 01:27:57.886]  Eco-science.
[01:27:58.226 --> 01:27:59.367]  All these other government documents.
[01:28:00.302 --> 01:28:02.423]  This is so anti-American.
[01:28:02.603 --> 01:28:03.903]  But it's all the nanny state.
[01:28:03.943 --> 01:28:04.924]  It's all for your own good.
[01:28:05.144 --> 01:28:11.646]  Yeah, like the government ships the heroin and cocaine in for our own good and has put 20% of school kids on Prozac and Ritalin for their own good?
[01:28:12.006 --> 01:28:12.706]  Shut up!
[01:28:13.887 --> 01:28:15.007]  I'm sick of your crap!
[01:28:16.178 --> 01:28:16.998]  Let me tell you something.
[01:28:17.238 --> 01:28:18.959]  Don't ever try to stick a needle in me.
[01:28:19.299 --> 01:28:21.920]  I can't put up with your Nazi bull anymore.
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:26.142]  Can you imagine some black and white movie where Nazis are drawing blood in Germany?
[01:28:27.022 --> 01:28:28.123]  Oh, that would be too extreme.
[01:28:28.163 --> 01:28:29.563]  Not even Nazis would do that.
[01:28:29.624 --> 01:28:29.764]  No.
[01:28:30.184 --> 01:28:32.545]  Only the fake America would do that.
[01:28:32.565 --> 01:28:33.005]  Here it is.
[01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:38.966]  Draw blood from people involved in one of three situations after a crash.
[01:28:39.326 --> 01:28:41.646]  Number one, if you injure someone in that crash.
[01:28:42.007 --> 01:28:44.327]  Or number two, if you have prior DWIs.
[01:28:44.407 --> 01:28:48.388]  Or number three, if you have a child in your car at the time of the crash.
[01:28:48.748 --> 01:28:52.928]  So in other words, blood can be drawn even if you're not suspected of driving drunk.
[01:28:54.229 --> 01:29:01.530]  This was sick and tired of a Texas law that allowed the defendant to destroy the very evidence we needed to protect society.
[01:29:05.128 --> 01:29:12.073]  And they use, of course, Williamson County, who's the most thuggish, like Boss Hogville, but worse, to say it's okay.
[01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:15.555]  And then meanwhile, they'll show you a drunk like it's all right.
[01:29:15.895 --> 01:29:17.256]  This is all about tyranny.
[01:29:17.456 --> 01:29:30.665]  I mean, I now have the local newspapers where I live saying I need to be arrested for people, not for putting the signs up, that it should be illegal, that I criticized our God, our Savior, Barack Obama.
[01:29:30.905 --> 01:29:33.407]  I mean, do you see how once they do this, it's all over?
[01:29:34.347 --> 01:29:35.568]  But in England, they're honest.
[01:29:36.008 --> 01:29:37.409]  This is about DNA databases.
[01:29:37.429 --> 01:29:38.150]  Let me tell you something.
[01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:41.512]  Is a newborn baby suspected of drunk driving or wrecking a car?
[01:29:41.812 --> 01:29:54.380]  Because for 36 years, at birth, in the Western world, under a UN mandate, blood is taken secretly at birth and put in a world DNA database, and that's now been declassified and been in all the local papers.
[01:29:54.661 --> 01:29:56.462]  This has nothing to do with security!
[01:29:56.662 --> 01:29:57.703]  It's about killing you!
[01:29:58.857 --> 01:30:01.860]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.782 --> 01:30:05.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:11.572]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:11.972 --> 01:30:16.954]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:17.314 --> 01:30:19.054]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:19.354 --> 01:30:24.176]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:24.356 --> 01:30:25.316]  How much do you want?
[01:30:25.536 --> 01:30:26.277]  When do you want it?
[01:30:26.657 --> 01:30:28.257]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:28.537 --> 01:30:29.378]  When will you need it?
[01:30:29.618 --> 01:30:31.678]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:31.819 --> 01:30:32.879]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:33.319 --> 01:30:37.083]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:30:37.224 --> 01:30:39.746]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:39.947 --> 01:30:43.150]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:43.531 --> 01:30:47.055]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:47.355 --> 01:30:48.356]  How much will you need?
[01:30:48.597 --> 01:30:49.197]  We don't know.
[01:30:49.498 --> 01:30:50.399]  How much do you want?
[01:30:50.599 --> 01:30:51.320]  All you can get.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.301]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:52.601 --> 01:30:55.366]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:55.646 --> 01:30:57.429]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:57.449 --> 01:30:58.350]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:13.088]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:13.228 --> 01:31:15.151]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:31:15.311 --> 01:31:17.614]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:17.754 --> 01:31:19.617]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:20.037 --> 01:31:21.379]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:21.659 --> 01:31:22.701]  There is a solution.
[01:31:22.921 --> 01:31:30.942]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:31.343 --> 01:31:38.404]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:44.465]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[01:31:44.825 --> 01:31:50.406]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:50.846 --> 01:31:54.651]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:54.992 --> 01:32:01.200]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:01.681]  866-762-9238.
[01:32:02.462 --> 01:32:05.787]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:08.257 --> 01:32:08.497]  I think so.
[01:32:29.444 --> 01:32:32.707]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:35.090]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:41.656]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.

[01:33:18.874 --> 01:33:26.681]  Coming up in the last segment, I wanted to play a clip from a film in the 70s called Zero Population.
[01:33:28.982 --> 01:33:30.023]  And we're doing research.
[01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:36.729]  It's the same name, but we were not sure it was the same person.
[01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:41.073]  But it looks like Paul R. Ehrlich was involved in making it.
[01:33:43.895 --> 01:33:44.816]  The actual people
[01:33:46.701 --> 01:33:50.383]  And we found out these guys are like master planners of everything in our life, basically.
[01:33:51.204 --> 01:33:56.026]  That's why we got Jay Rockefeller on video worshipping Holdren.
[01:33:59.568 --> 01:34:04.231]  Okay, uh... I'm gonna cover this now.
[01:34:05.912 --> 01:34:07.153]  I'm gonna cover this right now.
[01:34:09.874 --> 01:34:16.178]  When you watch CNN, and it's so slick, and they've got
[01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:26.288]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on, almost nightly now, explaining how great the Afghan war is and everything is so slick and high def.
[01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:45.362]  You have to understand that 20, 30, 40 years ago, the establishment was making news reporters behave as actors, but now they've just gotten rid of the journalist and replaced them with actors posing as journalists.
[01:34:46.237 --> 01:34:46.817]  You understand?
[01:34:47.678 --> 01:35:00.766]  So when you go back to 1991 and the start of the Gulf War, and we've got great reports on this from a few years ago at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:01.126 --> 01:35:04.368]  I saw another good report from the Tonka Report.
[01:35:04.788 --> 01:35:07.070]  We'll put that up on screen right here.
[01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.191]  CNN Charles
[01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:17.881]  Jacko in Saudi Arabia during the 91 Gulf War, CNN broadcast fake coverage from studios in Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:18.341 --> 01:35:19.741]  Viewers suspected nothing.
[01:35:20.122 --> 01:35:22.082]  And I remember watching this.
[01:35:22.182 --> 01:35:28.085]  I was glued to CNN at my friend's houses and at my girlfriend's house growing up in Dallas.
[01:35:28.425 --> 01:35:29.966]  That was right before I moved to Austin.
[01:35:30.806 --> 01:35:33.287]  And I remember in high school just
[01:35:34.966 --> 01:35:41.391]  American flag on my car, yellow ribbons on the house, just totally into it.
[01:35:43.893 --> 01:35:49.477]  And you see CNN's Charles Jaco joke off-camera about the hoax they were playing.
[01:35:50.217 --> 01:35:52.960]  Don't think for a moment they've stopped doing this.
[01:35:55.141 --> 01:36:02.727]  One only has to watch this clip to understand how a global media giant like CNN can fool not just a population but the entire planet.
[01:36:04.455 --> 01:36:12.402]  And I was in the comments section of InfoWars last night reading some comments, because I always get good tips, and somebody was in there asking me, Alex, why haven't you covered this?
[01:36:14.124 --> 01:36:16.446]  We actually broke this in the late 1990s.
[01:36:16.566 --> 01:36:22.852]  I was sent the footage, reportedly by somebody at CNN.
[01:36:23.432 --> 01:36:25.074]  And it was sent to me in beta tape.
[01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:26.935]  I had to get it transferred locally.
[01:36:27.316 --> 01:36:28.076]  We aired this.
[01:36:29.153 --> 01:36:34.737]  In 1997, maybe it was 98, somewhere that report is out there.
[01:36:34.757 --> 01:36:39.280]  Again, I have three storage buildings full of the, I used to do three, four TV shows depending on which week it was a week.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:45.164]  But I did this, but we also have a tape somewhere, maybe somebody can, I couldn't find it last night, maybe somebody can mail it.
[01:36:45.424 --> 01:36:51.809]  I know it was on PBS on some stations, where Dan Rather did fake newscasts even before Desert Shield.
[01:36:52.589 --> 01:36:57.914]  And then during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, from CBS Broadcast Center, there's fake reports.
[01:36:57.934 --> 01:37:00.957]  I mean, there's so many of these, I can't even keep... We didn't break that.
[01:37:01.017 --> 01:37:02.739]  I remember using clips of that as well, though.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.021]  So yes, I know about this.
[01:37:05.141 --> 01:37:05.602]  I broke it.
[01:37:06.503 --> 01:37:07.143]  I know all about it.
[01:37:08.825 --> 01:37:16.633]  Now, and I'm glad you brought it to our attention, because... You think about how ridiculous this is,
[01:37:18.402 --> 01:37:45.092]  eighteen years ago eighteen years into the beginning of the siege on iraq in the uh... at least three million dead total last six and a half years of liberation it's a million three hundred thousand conservatively but it's upwards of three million uh... lands at journal and other prestigious organizations that are uh... nonpartisan have come have come up with that so there's a bunch of these clips and if you just google
[01:37:46.564 --> 01:37:48.225]  For those listening on the radio, I want to see these.
[01:37:48.585 --> 01:37:55.748]  I got Watson doing another blurb report, kind of condensing our older reports on this, and some of the things people posted on Prison Planet.
[01:37:56.108 --> 01:37:58.569]  Like I said, the Tonka report's pretty good on this.
[01:37:59.049 --> 01:38:00.629]  There's a whole bunch of these videos.
[01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:03.410]  And there's him going, we're being hit.
[01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:05.911]  There's scuds coming in, oh my god.
[01:38:06.272 --> 01:38:12.394]  And then later they're joking, you know, about how they're going to pose and act like they're afraid of sarin nerve gas, which Saddam didn't fire.
[01:38:14.668 --> 01:38:19.651]  And then they do this whole thing where they pose and you see him in his ear getting the order.
[01:38:19.871 --> 01:38:21.472]  She's going, do you have your gas mask?
[01:38:21.492 --> 01:38:22.913]  And he's going, I don't have the report.
[01:38:23.173 --> 01:38:23.893]  Then he hears it.
[01:38:24.253 --> 01:38:28.336]  And then they do this stage thing where one puts on a helmet and the other guy puts on the gas mask.
[01:38:28.396 --> 01:38:34.559]  And they're actually laughing like 10 year olds in a elementary school fifth grade play.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:39.102]  Now that's because these are journalists being forced to be actors.
[01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:53.324]  And then I remember in 2000 it came out, even the Washington Post, which is the pot calling the kettle black, and World Net Daily as well, reporting that CNN admittedly has CIA writing the news.
[01:38:53.424 --> 01:38:54.585]  In fact, you can just Google that.
[01:38:54.625 --> 01:38:55.206]  We'll do that later.
[01:38:55.607 --> 01:38:57.249]  So, here is some of these clips.
[01:38:57.289 --> 01:38:57.789]  The point is,
[01:38:58.430 --> 01:39:04.251]  That here's a shot where one of them, one of the reporters, has a helmet on.
[01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:09.993]  The other guy does this fake thing where he's scared and does a fake panic putting a gas mask on.
[01:39:10.033 --> 01:39:12.133]  You see him trying to not laugh.
[01:39:12.833 --> 01:39:20.015]  But the reason I'm going to play this is you see this today and it's ridiculous, but I remember
[01:39:21.192 --> 01:39:23.354]  Seeing them reerit the fear.
[01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:29.939]  I don't know if it was live or not, but I remember seeing them, oh my god, it's so scary, they're putting gas masks on, and this was big news.
[01:39:30.039 --> 01:39:34.122]  I'm sure you all remember it as well, if you were, you know, old enough to remember it at the time.
[01:39:35.543 --> 01:39:40.367]  Eighteen years ago, because it was, my god, the missiles are coming in, they're scared, they've got masks on.
[01:39:42.368 --> 01:39:45.211]  Because we didn't know to not trust the media then.
[01:39:46.259 --> 01:39:50.917]  Now it's Anderson Cooper, glowing screens, high def, totally slick.
[01:39:53.396 --> 01:39:54.437]  And it's scary, folks.
[01:39:54.497 --> 01:39:56.498]  So, there's a whole bunch of these clips.
[01:39:56.558 --> 01:40:00.661]  Let's play the one first where the reporter is talking to him and going to him.
[01:40:01.082 --> 01:40:07.867]  Then we'll play some of the live satellite feeds that were going over satellites that news people could pick up but that weren't on TV.
[01:40:08.147 --> 01:40:09.208]  We're in between this.
[01:40:09.608 --> 01:40:17.874]  He's doing duck imitations of Donald Duck and screwing around and smoking cigarettes and laughing and playing with the ponytails of cameramen.
[01:40:17.894 --> 01:40:21.537]  And then five minutes later, oh my gosh, we're being hit!
[01:40:22.137 --> 01:40:22.717]  Here it is.
[01:40:22.737 --> 01:40:23.978]  Let's play one of the clips.
[01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.258]  You need to take cover.
[01:40:25.638 --> 01:40:28.859]  I notice that you've got your gas mask in your hands.
[01:40:28.939 --> 01:40:30.980]  If you need to put it on, please do so.
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:35.281]  If you need to take cover, please do so.
[01:40:36.041 --> 01:40:43.283]  If you are able to take a question, did you think that the possible threat would be over because it is now morning there?
[01:40:43.603 --> 01:40:44.123]  It's what?
[01:40:44.343 --> 01:40:45.824]  Just after 6 o'clock in the morning?
[01:40:46.164 --> 01:40:57.492]  Yeah, the whole thing is everyone assumed that the threat would be over because it was early morning, but the thing about Saddam Hussein is that he has never done the expected and right now we have... Alright, hit pause.
[01:40:57.572 --> 01:41:01.295]  Once again... Now this is what actually aired on CNN.
[01:41:01.895 --> 01:41:12.422]  The footage you're seeing, and for radio listeners, it's a split screen, the woman in CNN Center Atlanta next to the reporter Charles Jaco.
[01:41:14.164 --> 01:41:14.524]  Okay.
[01:41:15.925 --> 01:41:25.530]  And they got fake palm trees, they got a blue screen behind him so they can project, you know, city, the image of the city behind him during daytime shots.
[01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:26.551]  This is a nighttime shot.
[01:41:27.852 --> 01:41:37.677]  Then we have the raw satellite feeds where there's none of that and where he is laughing and joking and it's all ridiculous.
[01:41:37.977 --> 01:41:38.878]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:41:40.401 --> 01:41:40.941]  Right there,
[01:42:08.638 --> 01:42:10.702]  He screwed up and admitted they were in a hotel basement.
[01:42:11.363 --> 01:42:15.792]  So they click and put some feeds over it so they can tell him, shut up, stop it.
[01:42:16.413 --> 01:42:20.100]  You know, because these guys, this is one of the first times they've got him flat out acting.
[01:42:21.072 --> 01:42:24.434]  Because they're like, look, we've got to have it like you're really there.
[01:42:24.935 --> 01:42:26.355]  He's really in a soundstage somewhere.
[01:42:26.816 --> 01:42:28.217]  So let's continue.
[01:42:28.677 --> 01:42:30.478]  And then he gets the other reporter up and they do this.
[01:42:30.858 --> 01:42:32.259]  He goes, you're seeing at the order.
[01:42:32.299 --> 01:42:35.521]  He goes, OK, you're saying put my gas mask on.
[01:42:35.541 --> 01:42:37.443]  She's like, yes, put your gas mask on.
[01:42:37.483 --> 01:42:38.063]  He waits a minute.
[01:42:38.083 --> 01:42:38.984]  He goes, oh, I'm scared.
[01:42:39.024 --> 01:42:41.605]  I thought I said he's he's there taking the orders.
[01:42:41.625 --> 01:42:46.328]  I mean, this is a 10 year old could have done better acting in this.
[01:42:46.508 --> 01:42:46.609]  OK.
[01:42:47.659 --> 01:42:48.820]  But the guy should be a comedian.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.801]  He's got natural comic genius.
[01:42:51.342 --> 01:42:52.643]  Let's go back to the fake newscast.
[01:42:52.683 --> 01:42:53.964]  Here it is.
[01:42:54.124 --> 01:42:56.265]  It's not the national by afternoon.
[01:42:57.666 --> 01:43:01.149]  People are looking up in the sky, scanning the skies to see what they can see.
[01:43:01.829 --> 01:43:03.150]  Do we see much of anything out there?
[01:43:03.170 --> 01:43:07.674]  Can we see much of anything?
[01:43:07.754 --> 01:43:12.297]  Apparently there was some word of outgoing.
[01:43:12.337 --> 01:43:14.919]  Again, we cannot be specific about the direction.
[01:43:17.999 --> 01:43:22.502]  All right, we are now led to understand that there are also firings in another city in Saudi Arabia.
[01:43:22.962 --> 01:43:25.784]  CNN's Carl Rochelle is here with me, just came up.
[01:43:26.464 --> 01:43:30.927]  Carl, I know we can't be very specific given these restrictions, but within those parameters, what did you see?
[01:43:31.067 --> 01:43:33.608]  Well, what I saw, I didn't see anything hit.
[01:43:33.628 --> 01:43:41.053]  I looked at all those soda bottles, and there was a vapor trail coming from... Now they've got fake alarms going in the soundstage.
[01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:47.172]  And now he's gonna, they're gonna tell him, okay, put your gas mask on.
[01:43:47.932 --> 01:43:54.195]  And then he gets the orders that you can't hear, and then does the staged freakout in a minute.
[01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.977]  One guy puts a helmet on, the other a mask.
[01:43:57.617 --> 01:43:59.338]  I mean, this is Laurel and Hardy level.
[01:43:59.378 --> 01:44:08.323]  Now it's all glistening, scientific, perfect outfits, reading off teleprompters, videos in the background to distract you, switch you into subconscious mode.
[01:44:09.377 --> 01:44:11.259]  They're doing all of this, okay?
[01:44:12.019 --> 01:44:17.784]  And we admit we're now doing that to try to deprogram people and actually reach through the programming to people in their subconscious state.
[01:44:18.144 --> 01:44:20.526]  All of this stuff is not for people that are conscious.
[01:44:20.546 --> 01:44:22.268]  This is for subconscious people.
[01:44:23.291 --> 01:44:25.271]  Because you can't get to someone who's hypnotized.
[01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:31.973]  We're now learning the enemy's operations without going in through the same door the enemy went in to then unlock them.
[01:44:32.413 --> 01:44:33.513]  And then we tell you what we're doing.
[01:44:34.013 --> 01:44:37.274]  And this isn't anything like seven screens behind us with different images on them.
[01:44:37.614 --> 01:44:40.755]  This is just enough to try to get to the people.
[01:44:41.115 --> 01:44:42.215]  But anyway, side issue.
[01:44:42.675 --> 01:44:45.876]  Let's continue back with the just bubbling
[01:44:46.696 --> 01:44:47.257]  C.I.A.
[01:44:47.397 --> 01:44:52.581]  operation where they're using regular reporters that are laughing and joking and can't believe they've been told to do this.
[01:44:53.021 --> 01:44:56.484]  And you can see them suppressing laughing over and over again.
[01:44:56.504 --> 01:45:00.427]  And then finally, they cut from live and they're just like, ha ha ha ha!
[01:45:00.487 --> 01:45:01.488]  God, it's ridiculous!
[01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:03.290]  Alright, anyways, let's go back to it.
[01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:03.610]  Here it is.
[01:45:22.558 --> 01:45:24.161]  Man, I love live television here.
[01:45:36.259 --> 01:45:40.242]  You may smell some of the fumes from a missile exhaust going off.
[01:45:40.303 --> 01:45:44.786]  Missiles use a rocket accordite, some sort of... I have to apologize for that.
[01:45:44.886 --> 01:45:49.230]  I thought it was something momentarily dizzy.
[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:57.016]  You're more experienced in military affairs than I am, but it might have been a little gasping.
[01:45:58.657 --> 01:46:00.678]  I mean, they got a fake alarm going on.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:11.083]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:46:11.383 --> 01:46:17.226]  Now, let's go to other videos of him where they're admitting it's a joke off-air.
[01:46:18.166 --> 01:46:22.769]  Okay, this is the same day and there's another video of the next day, but there's a whole bunch of my singing.
[01:46:22.789 --> 01:46:23.549]  Just start playing them.
[01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:25.150]  Here's another one.
[01:46:29.028 --> 01:46:29.428]  Here he is.
[01:46:29.588 --> 01:46:33.812]  Well, Cheryl, it was almost exactly two hours ago when the sirens went off here in Saudi Arabia.
[01:46:33.832 --> 01:46:36.614]  Where we are in eastern Saudi Arabia, there was no problem.
[01:46:36.694 --> 01:46:40.357]  However, there was an intercept elsewhere near the capital city, Riyadh.
[01:46:40.377 --> 01:46:41.738]  We've got some videotape of that.
[01:46:41.778 --> 01:46:43.019]  You can take a look at it right now.
[01:46:43.659 --> 01:46:52.026]  The Saudi military says there were two incoming Scud missiles intercepted by Patriot missiles arcing into the night sky over the Saudi capital.
[01:46:52.826 --> 01:46:57.670]  However, after the intercepts, eyewitnesses reported some graffiti on it.
[01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:59.991]  Alright, hit pause.
[01:47:00.011 --> 01:47:01.872]  I'm going to explain what we're doing.
[01:47:01.912 --> 01:47:03.133]  He babbles for a while.
[01:47:03.413 --> 01:47:06.355]  This is a raw feed, that's why you don't see any CNN marks on it.
[01:47:06.955 --> 01:47:13.219]  And back in the old days, still with some older satellite systems, you can sit there and watch live, raw news feeds.
[01:47:13.439 --> 01:47:19.943]  So he was live, but the feed, they keep the feed open, he's just no longer on TV, and now the screwing around starts.
[01:47:20.523 --> 01:47:23.445]  Here's the complete, absolute joking around.
[01:47:23.945 --> 01:47:24.346]  Here it is.
[01:47:25.137 --> 01:47:26.337]  You can take a look out right now.
[01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:27.498]  Hi, Atlanta.
[01:47:27.638 --> 01:47:30.399]  We're about to have a short course in missile identification.
[01:47:31.079 --> 01:47:31.739]  This is a Scud.
[01:47:32.259 --> 01:47:34.160]  You can tell it by its distinctive label.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.621]  Now, when the missile is launched, the first thing you look for is the plume sticking out behind it.
[01:47:40.061 --> 01:47:43.162]  Now, when you detect this, you can tell it's been launched.
[01:47:43.822 --> 01:47:44.483]  Thank you.
[01:47:44.523 --> 01:47:46.043]  You see the graffiti on it?
[01:47:46.063 --> 01:47:47.484]  Yeah, show me the graffiti.
[01:47:47.504 --> 01:47:48.764]  Larry King show or bust.
[01:47:52.932 --> 01:47:53.312]  Look at this.
[01:47:53.672 --> 01:47:54.813]  Look at this.
[01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:55.393]  Look at this shit.
[01:48:02.034 --> 01:48:03.715]  The top ten things about Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:03.735 --> 01:48:05.295]  Maybe we could shrink the list to five.
[01:48:05.655 --> 01:48:07.216]  Oh God.
[01:48:07.436 --> 01:48:08.936]  Geopolitics by Dan Quayle.
[01:48:17.945 --> 01:48:32.148]  Oh, I love this country so much.
[01:48:32.288 --> 01:48:33.589]  You guys just don't have a clue.
[01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:38.790]  Well, Cheryl, it was almost exactly two hours ago when the sirens went off here in Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:42.210]  Where we are in eastern Saudi Arabia, there was no problem.
[01:48:43.231 --> 01:48:44.591]  You can just Google the term
[01:48:46.667 --> 01:48:49.831]  CNN, fake newscasts, Gulf War.
[01:48:49.991 --> 01:48:52.114]  And there's just, there's hundreds of them.
[01:48:52.154 --> 01:48:56.459]  I mean, probably 20, 30 different ones, but they're all repeated over and over again.
[01:48:56.479 --> 01:48:58.001]  So, it's an indeterminate amount.
[01:48:58.581 --> 01:48:59.763]  Scores of pages of them.
[01:49:00.444 --> 01:49:03.007]  I mean, you can just go there and they're just everywhere.
[01:49:03.487 --> 01:49:04.588]  On YouTube, everywhere else.
[01:49:05.089 --> 01:49:22.422]  What I want somebody to find, because I know we have this, I know it aired on PBS in Austin, because I taped it, later played clips on my local access show, but it wasn't a national PBS show, it aired here and there, with Dan Rather doing fake bombing raids and fake drills about what Saddam was going to do.
[01:49:23.403 --> 01:49:25.324]  It's even worse than what we just showed you.
[01:49:26.105 --> 01:49:29.788]  Now, that in mind, think about how slick CNN is now.
[01:49:30.088 --> 01:49:31.509]  We'll punch CNN up on screen.
[01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:40.040]  Now look at how slick it is and all the distractions and all the high-tech look, and that's nothing.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:49.283]  You watch shows like Anderson Cooper, you watch The Situation Room, I mean, it's glistening, monitors, 3D, just everything to make it look credible.
[01:49:50.643 --> 01:50:01.667]  And instead of using corny journalists to pose as actors, they now have slick actors posing as journalists.
[01:50:02.652 --> 01:50:03.413]  And that's it.
[01:50:03.533 --> 01:50:05.754]  And it goes on on Fox News as well.
[01:50:07.175 --> 01:50:08.676]  That's all this crap is.
[01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:10.537]  And it's a big joke to them.
[01:50:12.718 --> 01:50:15.920]  And they're people reading off a teleprompter, just like Barack Obama.
[01:50:17.403 --> 01:50:19.285]  He's not a good speaker without his teleprompter.
[01:50:19.625 --> 01:50:21.446]  Bush isn't a good speaker with it or without it.
[01:50:22.287 --> 01:50:22.888]  It's fake.
[01:50:23.248 --> 01:50:23.928]  It's an image.
[01:50:24.008 --> 01:50:26.450]  It's a corporate image they're selling you.
[01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:30.193]  You better get to the real issues that actually affect everybody.
[01:50:30.854 --> 01:50:33.416]  Did Aaron bring in that zero population growth video yet?
[01:50:33.436 --> 01:50:36.218]  Okay, we're going to play this when we come back in the final segment.
[01:50:36.999 --> 01:50:39.281]  Let's go out with a clip of this and then come back with it.
[01:50:40.722 --> 01:50:43.745]  We'll just play some of the zero population growth in the background.
[01:50:44.545 --> 01:50:45.186]  We don't have time.
[01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:49.475]  Now here they are, exterminating people.
[01:50:50.015 --> 01:50:52.757]  Because the atmosphere is screwed up.
[01:50:52.777 --> 01:50:54.397]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:50:54.417 --> 01:50:54.798]  Stay with us.
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:10.121]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:10.161 --> 01:51:15.524]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:15.764 --> 01:51:20.387]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:20.767 --> 01:51:25.851]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:26.351 --> 01:51:31.034]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:31.574 --> 01:51:38.497]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:38.677 --> 01:51:39.577]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:39.797 --> 01:51:46.179]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:46.479 --> 01:51:49.321]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:49.681 --> 01:51:51.561]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:51.901 --> 01:51:52.822]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:56.463 --> 01:52:00.186]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:00.706 --> 01:52:05.209]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:05.529 --> 01:52:07.991]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:09.132 --> 01:52:10.552]  It is a big idea.
[01:52:10.572 --> 01:52:12.674]  A new world order.
[01:52:13.394 --> 01:52:17.957]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.019]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:52:21.119 --> 01:52:23.281]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:23.866 --> 01:52:26.328]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:27.068 --> 01:52:34.393]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:37.409 --> 01:52:42.393]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:42.853 --> 01:52:46.536]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:46.716 --> 01:52:49.218]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:52:49.278 --> 01:52:50.259]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:50.279 --> 01:52:51.199]  They're not after money.
[01:52:51.239 --> 01:52:52.340]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:53.261]  They're after power.
[01:52:53.521 --> 01:52:54.442]  That's what I have to teach you.
[01:52:54.662 --> 01:52:59.205]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:52:59.425 --> 01:53:02.207]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:10.431 --> 01:53:14.473]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:53:14.933 --> 01:53:17.894]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.

[01:53:28.318 --> 01:53:39.841]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[01:53:40.141 --> 01:53:43.002]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.

[01:53:58.429 --> 01:53:59.189]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[01:53:59.410 --> 01:53:59.890]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:53:59.910 --> 01:54:03.013]  I'm gonna play this again tomorrow and comment on it properly.
[01:54:20.418 --> 01:54:21.678]  But we're going to play it here in a moment.
[01:54:23.799 --> 01:54:29.380]  But going back briefly to the CNN, I asked the crew what they thought of it.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.401]  They just said it looked hokey, ridiculous, crazy.
[01:54:31.841 --> 01:54:32.401]  Exactly.
[01:54:32.541 --> 01:54:38.142]  That was the low-tech disinformation and propaganda and acting and fake news.
[01:54:38.642 --> 01:54:42.203]  Now look at the science in 18 years they've brought it to.
[01:54:42.603 --> 01:54:44.564]  Literally hypnotizing, mesmerizing.
[01:54:46.823 --> 01:54:56.008]  And the ads are all about police pulling you over, and the guy's got a motorcycle helmet full of beer, and everybody's guilty, and... I mean, it's just, uh...
[01:54:58.627 --> 01:55:05.188]  It's all about training you how to be a slave and how the government cares and they do all this because they care.
[01:55:05.488 --> 01:55:06.549]  No, they don't care about you.
[01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:20.491]  Now, this book, this government textbook by the White House Science Czar calls for a planetary federation, a planetary government to carry out the orderly extermination of a population and a zero population growth minimum.
[01:55:21.672 --> 01:55:27.273]  And then it turns out the very same people involved in this were involved in writing movies like Zero Population Growth.
[01:55:27.633 --> 01:55:28.113]  Here it is.
[01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:37.071]  My fellow citizens, it is with a heavy heart that I bring you the findings of the Council.
[01:55:38.391 --> 01:56:00.258]  After deliberating in continuous session for the last four months in unceasing effort to find a solution to the devastating problem of overpopulation threatening to destroy what remains of our planet, the World Federation Council has considered and rejected all halfway measures advanced by the various regional scientific congresses.
[01:56:01.854 --> 01:56:07.357]  We have also rejected proposals for selective euthanasia and mass sterilization.
[01:56:08.677 --> 01:56:16.101]  Knowing the sacrifices that our decision will entail, the World Council has nevertheless reached a unanimous decision.
[01:56:16.521 --> 01:56:21.823]  We join with all other nations of the world in the following edict.
[01:56:22.583 --> 01:56:25.365]  Childbearing is herewith forbidden.
[01:56:25.385 --> 01:56:26.425]  No!
[01:56:26.445 --> 01:56:26.505]  No!
[01:56:26.525 --> 01:56:26.625]  No!
[01:56:30.563 --> 01:56:35.105]  ...shall be the gravest of crimes, punishable by death.
[01:56:36.426 --> 01:56:41.288]  Women now pregnant will report to local hospitals for registration.
[01:56:42.388 --> 01:56:43.729]  Electronic imprint is fine.
[01:56:44.089 --> 01:56:45.890]  John Graham, 7734575.
[01:56:46.570 --> 01:56:49.051]  Handle it gently.
[01:56:49.071 --> 01:56:52.172]  You won't be seeing any more of these for 30 years.
[01:56:54.573 --> 01:56:57.595]  Welcome to Babyland.
[01:56:57.615 --> 01:56:59.856]  This is the first day of the rest of your lives
[01:57:00.509 --> 01:57:03.590]  The proud parents of your own little boy or little girl.
[01:57:12.372 --> 01:57:15.193]  After all, we've had eight years to improve on the original model.
[01:57:15.893 --> 01:57:17.974]  At the time of the edict, they were hardly more than toys.
[01:57:18.894 --> 01:57:22.375]  Ah, they're designed to go through the whole range of childhood diseases.
[01:57:22.715 --> 01:57:23.396]  Nothing serious.
[01:57:23.916 --> 01:57:26.497]  Just enough to keep Mother constantly on her toes.
[01:57:27.077 --> 01:57:27.957]  Do you have a name for her?
[01:57:28.851 --> 01:57:30.773]  We need a name so we can program her.
[01:57:31.333 --> 01:57:31.654]  Bonnie.
[01:57:32.334 --> 01:57:33.015]  After my mother.
[01:57:33.595 --> 01:57:33.916]  Bonnie.
[01:57:33.996 --> 01:57:35.397]  Bonnie.
[01:57:36.037 --> 01:57:36.338]  Bonnie.
[01:57:46.321 --> 01:57:48.784]  All right, that's enough of this evil.
[01:57:49.164 --> 01:57:51.786]  And they kill your kid and kill you if they catch you having kids.
[01:57:52.307 --> 01:57:54.168]  Now, this is what they're really planning.
[01:57:54.208 --> 01:57:58.733]  And they said, we can sell people that we're losing our atmosphere or having an ice age.
[01:57:59.373 --> 01:58:02.536]  And by the 70s, they said, no, we'll say it's global warming.
[01:58:03.457 --> 01:58:04.738]  They admit it's all made up.
[01:58:04.778 --> 01:58:07.481]  They just want to reduce the population because they're control freaks.
[01:58:09.335 --> 01:58:11.555]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:11.635 --> 01:58:14.216]  I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[01:58:14.256 --> 01:58:19.157]  And don't forget, in this fight against the globalists and their predictive programming, that's what that is.
[01:58:19.637 --> 01:58:25.138]  All these science fiction movies saying you gotta have a license to have kids, or you can't have any kids, or Logan's Run.
[01:58:25.558 --> 01:58:31.079]  It's all admittedly to condition you to where now when you talk to the average person, they go, yeah, there are too many people.
[01:58:31.499 --> 01:58:32.780]  We do need to license parents.
[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:34.520]  But license their kids?
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:34.700]  No.
[01:58:36.670 --> 01:58:39.011]  Don't forget the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:39.211 --> 01:58:40.732]  We need your support now more than ever.
[01:58:41.473 --> 01:58:44.154]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com with John Perkins.
[01:58:44.654 --> 01:58:45.435]  Great job, crew!
[01:58:50.498 --> 01:58:52.559]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:53.119 --> 01:58:56.301]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.292 --> 01:59:03.274]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:59:03.534 --> 01:59:05.335]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:59:05.535 --> 01:59:13.819]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
