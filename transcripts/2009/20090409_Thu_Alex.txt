[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.450]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:33.091]  I am passionate about liberty.
[00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.576]  I am fired up about freedom.
[00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:36.226]  I'm a mammal.
[00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:41.789]  I want my tribe, my people, which is everybody on the planet who wants freedom, to live free.
[00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.730]  We're a lot like dogs.
[00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.391]  You ever seen your dog laying there, doesn't want to get up and go out to use the bathroom?
[00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.332]  You can go, come on, come on, let's see what's out there.
[00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:49.212]  Let's see what's out there.
[00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:50.173]  That's how I am.
[00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:52.454]  There's no act here where I get all excited.
[00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:53.434]  That's why it's so effective.
[00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:54.435]  I really am excited.
[00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.655]  I really am fired up.
[00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:57.156]  I could talk 50 hours a day.
[00:00:57.176 --> 00:01:02.859]  I feel like I could take on a hundred of these little chicken neck, little commies that want our guns.
[00:01:04.488 --> 00:01:10.073]  I know we can whoop them, and I'm sick of them, arrogant little bastards thinking they can play these mind games with us.
[00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:11.375]  It's time to defeat them!
[00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:17.641]  The phony right-wingers, the phony left-wingers, all of these establishment whores.
[00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.344]  George Humphrey, economist, former Austin City Council member, filmmaker, author.
[00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:25.536]  Successful businessman will be in studios for the rest of the hour coming up with your phone calls.
[00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:27.818]  It was just a few issues I didn't get in the interview I did at his house.
[00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.900]  I want the new Obama film, so that's why he's here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.242]  He'll have plenty of time to take your calls.
[00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:35.546]  Then I got the chemtrail experts coming on, but I do gotta give it to Keith Olbermann.
[00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.807]  I know people that know him privately.
[00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.189]  He is a 9-11 truther, that's all I'm gonna say.
[00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.771]  He's shown that on his show.
[00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.912]  He is a liberal, but he's a real liberal.
[00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:51.236]  And he has been criticizing Obama on continuing torture, continuing secret arrest, continuing holding detainees.
[00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:55.839]  And he's really going against his whole audience on this, and he's got to be commended.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.720]  And he's not perfect.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.681]  I'm not saying I love him, and I'm sitting in his lap.
[00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.582]  Same thing with Lou Dobbs.
[00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:04.503]  The point is, he's legitimate.
[00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:07.185]  And I know people that know Lou Dobbs, and I've talked to Lou Dobbs off air.
[00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:08.626]  Lou Dobbs is getting away with what he can, too.
[00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:17.021]  But I'm asking the liberals, instead of attacking me and calling for my arrest and my rape and for me to be put in prison, why don't you have a soul?
[00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.722]  You're upset because I'm pointing out your emperor has no clothes.
[00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:33.108]  And I have credibility because I exposed George Bush for eight years and all your leftist followers are waking up going, wait, Alex is exposing Obama and the left's attacking him and calling him a right winger when he exposed Bush.
[00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:33.988]  This is a fraud.
[00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.729]  Why don't we focus on Obama?
[00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:39.630]  And that's what Jonathan Turley, the law professor, says, we've interviewed many times.
[00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.756]  He says, look, Obama may think as a cult of personality he's allowed to do this.
[00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.138]  He isn't allowed to do this.
[00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.920]  And you can tell that's heartfelt, too.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.584]  So let's play this clip, and George Humphrey will be here in the studio.
[00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:52.186]  This is Keith Uberman, two nights ago.
[00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.223]  Good evening from New York.
[00:02:54.243 --> 00:03:08.458]  During his run for the presidency, Barack Obama, who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, argued strongly against the Bush administration use of executive authority, including its self-justification, its rationalization of the warrantless wiretapping of American citizens.
[00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.444]  Our first story on the Countdown, that was then, this is now, President Obama's Justice Department.
[00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:24.895]  Now, not just defending Bush officials from lawsuits surrounding National Security Agency domestic spying, but seeking to expand the government's authority by making it immune from any legal challenge regarding wiretapping.
[00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:25.516]  Ever.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.085]  Welcome to Change You Cannot Believe In, or Sue Over the Case, Juul versus NSA.
[00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:36.570]  Five plaintiffs who contend that AT&T illegally transmitted information about their phone habits to the NSA.
[00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:47.061]  Attorney General Holder's Justice Department arguing a lot of things, including something called the State's Secrets Privilege, the executive branch's standard go-to move to protect classified information.
[00:03:47.381 --> 00:04:00.530]  Quoting from page 12 of the government's motion to dismiss, all of plaintiff's claims in this case would require or risk the disclosure of information properly protected by the Director of National Intelligence's assertion of the state secret's privilege.
[00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:09.777]  As we mentioned, standard stuff, but the real doozy, the Obama administration seeking to expand its authority, arguing that under something else called sovereign immunity,
[00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:13.558]  The government can only be sued if the wiretaps involve willful disclosure.
[00:04:13.598 --> 00:04:13.878]  Page 5.
[00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:21.400]  A willful violation in section 223C1 refers to the willful disclosure of intelligence information by government agents.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.902]  And such disclosures by the government are the only actions that create liability against the United States.
[00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:35.164]  In other words, unless the government publicly releases any information about you that it has gathered by spying on you, you cannot sue it.
[00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:37.965]  It gets better, and by better I mean worse.
[00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:48.688]  The Obama administration wants you to believe that it does not matter if the program is no longer operative, arguing that the same standards should apply for the first Bush terrorist surveillance program, the TSP.
[00:04:49.108 --> 00:04:49.908]  Page 15.
[00:04:50.288 --> 00:05:04.252]  Attempting to demonstrate that the TSP was not the content dragnet plaintiffs allege, or that the NSA has not otherwise engaged in alleged content dragnet, would require the disclosure of highly classified NSA intelligence sources and methods about the TSP,
[00:05:05.152 --> 00:05:06.493]  And other NSA activities.
[00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:09.374]  Even confirming or denying already publicly confirmed facts.
[00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:12.215]  Like the compliance of AT&T and other telecom giants.
[00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:16.576]  Right down to the numbers of some of the rooms in which the information mining machinery was contained.
[00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:18.797]  That is apparently out of bounds.
[00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.118]  Page 16.
[00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:31.462]  The DNI again has demonstrated the disclosure of whether the NSA has an intelligence relationship with a private or particular private company would also cause exceptional harm to national security.
[00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:33.163]  The Obama administration.
[00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:38.085]  Time now to call in our own Howard Fineman, senior Washington correspondent for Newsweek Magazine.
[00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:38.766]  Howard, good evening.
[00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:40.527]  Good evening, Keith.
[00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:42.728]  What is the political calculation here and who made it?
[00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:49.851]  Well, as to the first question, the Obama administration is balancing two things.
[00:05:50.612 --> 00:05:59.977]  One is the public politics and the risk of really antagonizing the first base that gathered beneath and behind and pushed the Obama candidacy.
[00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:09.882]  The one that was concerned about the war in Iraq, the one that was concerned about overreaching by military, the one that was concerned about overreaching by the then President of the United States.
[00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:12.263]  Those people are concerned and they're upset.
[00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:13.564]  And they're disappointed.
[00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:18.606]  But there's an internal politics too, and it's the politics of the intelligence community.
[00:06:18.646 --> 00:06:20.367]  It's the politics of the CIA.
[00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:27.651]  And Barack Obama is an outsider there, and he picked as his CIA director another outsider, Leon Panetta.
[00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:39.998]  And in talking to Democrats on the Hill and talking to experts such as Jane Mayer, the author of the terrific book about the dark side of the Bush administration in terms of torture and surveillance, this is what's going on here.
[00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:52.206]  Obama and his people in the White House do not want to antagonize the intelligence community because they need them to support them in the war on terror and to get the President's job done around the world right now.
[00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:53.367]  That's what's going on.
[00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:58.571]  As a function of that, is this the bottom line of bureaucracy as theory?
[00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:12.123]  That two parties could argue about how to use a bureaucracy, where to point the bureaucracy, who to target with the bureaucracy, but ultimately, the bureaucracy will be defended by both sides, by people who would otherwise happily be at each other's throats.
[00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:20.536]  Yeah, I think there's something to that in general, Keith, but more specifically when you're talking about the President's powers as Commander-in-Chief.
[00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:24.398]  There's so many ironies here, they're piled so high they're toppling over.
[00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:34.826]  Barack Obama ran against the arrogation of power by a President who seemed to see no bounds to his power in the war on terror.
[00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:58.399]  This administration, through its Justice Department, and I think with the asked earlier question, who approved this, it's a little hard for me to figure out because a lot of the key players are just on their way back from the President's trip, but I don't think there's any doubt that the NSC Director, probably the White House Counsel, Greg Craig, and maybe even the President himself know everything that's going on here.
[00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:01.821]  No President wants to cede
[00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:06.163]  Any power that the presidency itself has accumulated.
[00:08:06.843 --> 00:08:11.965]  Even if they were accumulated by people that the current occupant campaigned against.
[00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:19.848]  So the state secrets assertion, and as you say the sovereign immunity assertion, are ones that Barack Obama and his Justice Department aren't going to give up.
[00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:23.070]  In part because in some of these cases they're now the defendants.
[00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.771]  Don't forget that some of these cases were delayed.
[00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:32.434]  George Bush's name and the other Bush administration officials' names were wiped away from the slate.
[00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:35.716]  And Barack Obama and his advisors are now the defendants.
[00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:49.163]  Are these signposts along the road towards a decision by this administration whether or not to prosecute or to at least pursue members of the Bush administration for the various violations and crimes involved in torture, in eavesdropping?
[00:08:50.535 --> 00:08:54.658]  Well, as Jane Mayer told me a little while ago, she said, look, they've shut down the dark side, okay?
[00:08:54.678 --> 00:09:06.628]  They're not, as far as we know, the torturing is over, Guantanamo's going to be closed, but they don't want to shine a flashlight into the dark, what was the dark side, for the reasons that I said before, and they're going to leave it up to the Congress to pursue it.
[00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:09.451]  Now, I'm talking to Democrats on the Hill this afternoon.
[00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:15.316]  Senator Leahy, the Democrat of the Judiciary Committee, wants a commission of some kind.
[00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:21.799]  But he's not going to try to impose one or establish one unless Republicans support it.
[00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:27.641]  So far, not a single Republican has come forth to support that flashlight shining exercise.
[00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:30.503]  The Obama administration will not do it on its own.
[00:09:30.883 --> 00:09:33.544]  They're going to keep their fingers crossed and hope that Congress does it.
[00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:36.905]  But right now, Congress isn't going to do it without Republicans going along.
[00:09:37.045 --> 00:09:41.407]  Howard Fineman of MSNBC and Newsweek, you said the ironies were piling up.
[00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:43.368]  Something certainly is piling up right now.
[00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:44.009]  Thank you, Howard.
[00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:45.989]  Thank you, Keith.
[00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.551]  Okay, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:49.571 --> 00:09:55.514]  We've got the big Chemtrail interview coming up with Rosalind Peterson, California Skywatch, with the federal government.
[00:09:57.215 --> 00:10:06.719]  Now, coming out, the Council on Foreign Relations announcing they want to have aircraft spray the exact barium salts, aluminum dioxide, to save us from the space race.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.982]  They are now admitting they've been testing it for years.
[00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:14.383]  All this spraying is testing.
[00:10:15.223 --> 00:10:24.289]  And that now they want a public, in the words of the Council on Foreign Relations, global system of geoengineering.
[00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.892]  That is directly from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:40.400]  So I wanted, George, you were just talking about you were out in California a few weeks ago at a golf tournament, and you were there all week, and one day it would be clear, next day chemtrails, and people couldn't notice it and understand.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.282]  And then yesterday in Austin, you know, I live in West Austin,
[00:10:44.002 --> 00:10:45.763]  I mean, these were like 2,000 feet in the air.
[00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:46.543]  They were right there.
[00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.804]  And you'd see the trails spanning out.
[00:10:49.385 --> 00:10:52.506]  I saw the biggest chemtrail I've ever seen in my life yesterday.
[00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:54.307]  I was at the shop.
[00:10:54.407 --> 00:10:54.967]  I came out.
[00:10:54.987 --> 00:11:02.111]  We were talking about Alex Jones and all the people in the shop knew who Alex Jones was, is, and were all supportive.
[00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:06.493]  And I come walking out and there was the largest chemtrail I've ever seen in my life.
[00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:09.535]  And I've been looking up in the sky for the last 12 years.
[00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:11.535]  And I've seen it all.
[00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:13.536]  I've seen it all over this country.
[00:11:13.576 --> 00:11:14.396]  I've seen it in Europe.
[00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:18.618]  And this chemtrail here in Austin, Texas yesterday was gargantuan.
[00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.358]  And I brought everybody out.
[00:11:20.378 --> 00:11:21.639]  I said, do you know what that is?
[00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:23.940]  And they go, well, no, not really.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.881]  And I said, and I explained what a contrail was.
[00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:28.201]  And they all went, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:29.462]  Well, is that a contrail?
[00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:29.942]  No.
[00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:33.243]  And when I explained it to them, their jaws all dropped.
[00:11:33.503 --> 00:11:35.884]  This is one of the most difficult things.
[00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:43.526]  for human beings to understand because they can see and understand that the poisoning is actually happening.
[00:11:43.826 --> 00:11:49.788]  It's right there in the cognitive dissidence or the defense mechanisms that people have.
[00:11:50.048 --> 00:12:03.132]  But when they finally get that our government is spraying our skies with barium, ethylene, dibromide and other chemicals, it really wakes people up.
[00:12:03.152 --> 00:12:03.972]  Stay there, gotta break!
[00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:16.095]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:17.637]  Garden in a can!
[00:12:17.997 --> 00:12:21.581]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:23.904]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:26.447]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[00:12:26.907 --> 00:12:35.975]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[00:12:36.596 --> 00:12:37.597]  Garden in a can.
[00:12:38.017 --> 00:12:38.878]  It's that simple.
[00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:41.080]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.564]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:46.845]  Ready when you are.

[00:12:56.212 --> 00:12:57.833]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:10.725]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:11.226 --> 00:13:18.230]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:18.817 --> 00:13:25.003]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:25.403 --> 00:13:27.245]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:27.385 --> 00:13:29.787]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:29.887 --> 00:13:40.817]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:41.458 --> 00:13:42.759]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.501]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:51.320]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:59.666]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:00.147 --> 00:14:01.308]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:01.728 --> 00:14:02.989]  The people strike back.
[00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.913]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:14.718]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds,
[00:14:15.174 --> 00:14:16.255]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:20.358]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:34.248]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:40.112]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:14:40.392 --> 00:14:46.356]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:14:47.057 --> 00:14:48.398]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:48.418 --> 00:14:50.019]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:50.379]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:52.481]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:52.561]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:04.577 --> 00:15:12.661]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:15:12.821 --> 00:15:17.224]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:21.906]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:23.467]  It's a documented fact.
[00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:30.951]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:15:31.111 --> 00:15:42.938]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:46.881]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:50.323]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:15:50.603 --> 00:15:54.285]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:15:54.345 --> 00:15:57.827]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:15:57.847 --> 00:15:58.067]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:23.144]  You know, George came in and said that he got all these emails from people he knows who have never known about chemtrails, telling him about chemtrails today.
[00:16:23.744 --> 00:16:25.625]  And they were Paul Watson's article he wrote last night.
[00:16:25.645 --> 00:16:27.086]  It's owned by Steve Watson right now.
[00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:35.651]  And there's just a mass awakening, and the buzz you're getting from the Obama deception that you're in, again, another indicator of how people are really waking up.
[00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:40.954]  Well, just in the last 10 days, you were kind enough to give me some copies of the Obama deception.
[00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:44.457]  And clearly, I'm prejudiced because I'm in the movie.
[00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:53.923]  But I'll tell you what, every single person, every single person that I've given this to has responded incredibly positively.
[00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.344]  And these are just not
[00:16:56.328 --> 00:16:58.009]  You know, Ron Paul Patriots.
[00:16:58.189 --> 00:17:00.750]  I have given this to McCain supporters.
[00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.811]  I've given this to liberal Democrats.
[00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:05.773]  I've given this to people who are somewhat apathetic.
[00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:12.316]  And to a person, everyone's going, this movie is waking me up.
[00:17:12.377 --> 00:17:16.679]  This thing is so much bigger than we thought.
[00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:21.501]  And the quality of this film is excellent.
[00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:30.064]  Alex, I just want to say thank you very much for allowing me to be part of this, and for all of you out there.
[00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:32.625]  And I'm sure that most of you have watched this.
[00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:33.946]  Get copies.
[00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:35.087]  Copy it.
[00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:36.709]  Share it with your friends.
[00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:41.657]  The time for questions is over.
[00:17:41.717 --> 00:17:42.998]  The time to make a choice.
[00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:44.519]  Are you on the side of freedom?
[00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:46.500]  Are you on the side of republic?
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.281]  Are you on the side of truth?
[00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:49.802]  Are you on the side of freedom?
[00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:57.867]  Or do you support the New World Order and the lies and the destruction to our culture, to our community, and to our families?
[00:17:58.448 --> 00:18:00.889]  And friends, we're making progress.
[00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.793]  I honestly believe that Alex's ID has increased 100%.
[00:18:07.994 --> 00:18:09.035]  In the last two months.
[00:18:09.536 --> 00:18:09.996]  All over.
[00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:22.387]  And the reason I say this is because I take my coffee shop poll and I go to the same coffee shop which is about one third Republicans, one third Democrats, and about one third Independents.
[00:18:23.888 --> 00:18:28.753]  And a month or so ago, people were in there, Obama, Obama, Obama.
[00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:30.435]  I think?
[00:18:46.705 --> 00:18:48.908]  Much, much different than he told us.
[00:18:49.449 --> 00:18:50.990]  He's going back on his word.
[00:18:51.411 --> 00:18:53.173]  And then they start talking to me.
[00:18:53.573 --> 00:18:55.235]  They initiate the situation.
[00:18:55.736 --> 00:19:02.183]  So, if this little coffee shop is any reflection of the bigger picture, which I know it is,
[00:19:03.086 --> 00:19:03.926]  We're doing well.
[00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:14.569]  And the work that Alex and you, the people out there, are doing to protect our republic, to protect truth, to live in peace, and to do the right thing.
[00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:17.090]  This is not a question of left or right.
[00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:24.112]  And the final barrier is people still think it's liberal versus democrat, republican versus
[00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:30.018]  Republican versus, you know, Democrat and Socialist versus Conservative.
[00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:30.959]  It's not.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.962]  It's not a left and right battle.
[00:19:33.483 --> 00:19:36.507]  It is a battle between right and wrong.
[00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:44.266]  It's a battle between the very, very few at the very top of the ladder and 99% of us.
[00:19:45.246 --> 00:19:49.488]  And, you know, we have truth on our side, we have the numbers on our side.
[00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:55.171]  They clearly right now have the media, they have all this funny money, and they have the weapons.
[00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:57.132]  But truth wins.
[00:19:57.992 --> 00:20:03.474]  By telling the truth, by looking people in the eyes, and we don't have to yell at them.
[00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:06.575]  All we have to do is share with them the facts.
[00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:09.036]  Do they believe in a sound currency?
[00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:10.737]  Do they believe in peace?
[00:20:10.957 --> 00:20:12.778]  Do they believe in transparency?
[00:20:13.198 --> 00:20:14.758]  Do they believe in the rule of law?
[00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.359]  And just cite examples.
[00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:21.081]  And when you cite the facts with authority, you will win people over.
[00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:26.163]  And the biggest thing right now is that we have to increase our numbers.
[00:20:26.863 --> 00:20:28.083]  That is the bottom line.
[00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:35.145]  This is the battle of, on a third dimensional level, of survival.
[00:20:35.465 --> 00:20:37.506]  And we have to take care of our finances.
[00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:40.166]  And all of you need to get liquid and protect yourself.
[00:20:40.386 --> 00:20:41.767]  You need to take care of your health.
[00:20:42.087 --> 00:20:43.607]  We need to create community.
[00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:46.008]  And we need to organize.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.081]  You need to organize right now.
[00:20:50.642 --> 00:20:51.602]  Create groups.
[00:20:51.742 --> 00:20:53.003]  Create study circles.
[00:20:53.703 --> 00:20:54.744]  Share this film.
[00:20:55.284 --> 00:20:57.385]  Go out and talk to everyone you know.
[00:20:57.805 --> 00:21:05.229]  Just by doing my errands today, I've talked to at least seven people who were not aware of this stuff and who I shared this with today.
[00:21:05.249 --> 00:21:08.711]  And to a person, every single one of them,
[00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:10.672]  Know that something is very wrong.
[00:21:11.153 --> 00:21:20.739]  And we have to share the scary parts but we also have to remind them that we're human beings and we help create this problem and we can solve this problem.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.822]  And we as human beings are not junk.
[00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:27.983]  Is that we're very special, and this is a time of transition.
[00:21:28.783 --> 00:21:29.903]  You know, it's a choice.
[00:21:30.224 --> 00:21:30.464]  It is.
[00:21:30.504 --> 00:21:31.384]  George, we've got to break again.
[00:21:31.404 --> 00:21:37.065]  I want to take calls when we come back, but I've got you here specifically to make a few points for the film that I may use.
[00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:44.407]  Specifically, some more of those stories of Obama people in denial, you know, because they think you're for McCain if you criticize Obama.
[00:21:44.727 --> 00:21:47.528]  Him lying about bowing to the king, that's now been confirmed.
[00:21:47.548 --> 00:21:50.049]  I'm going to play that video for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:52.270]  And the audio for everybody else.
[00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.330]  And a lot more coming up.
[00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.771]  Stay with us.
[00:21:56.311 --> 00:21:57.212]  We're on the march.
[00:21:57.712 --> 00:21:59.292]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:02.914]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.110]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:13.491]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:17.832]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[00:22:18.232 --> 00:22:20.153]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[00:22:20.413 --> 00:22:24.873]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[00:22:25.213 --> 00:22:31.515]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[00:22:32.115 --> 00:22:33.315]  One Florida customer says,
[00:22:33.783 --> 00:22:41.852]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery.
[00:22:42.393 --> 00:22:46.537]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:22:47.038 --> 00:22:49.941]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[00:22:50.401 --> 00:22:52.283]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com.
[00:22:52.644 --> 00:22:53.845]  That's 9voltlite.com.
[00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:56.869]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:18.014]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:23:18.554 --> 00:23:24.739]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.861]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:27.021 --> 00:23:29.403]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:29.483 --> 00:23:40.372]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:23:42.657 --> 00:23:43.918]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:44.318 --> 00:23:45.738]  It's about a one world government.
[00:23:46.178 --> 00:23:52.541]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:23:53.101 --> 00:24:00.864]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:01.364 --> 00:24:02.504]  The Obama Deception.
[00:24:02.924 --> 00:24:04.105]  The people strike back.
[00:24:05.692 --> 00:24:12.657]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:24:12.897 --> 00:24:17.200]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.563]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:24:23.064 --> 00:24:30.168]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:35.492]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:24:35.972 --> 00:24:41.416]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:47.320]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:25:17.964 --> 00:25:27.506]  George, you might want to double check to make sure there's audio in those headphones.
[00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.827]  We're going to have calls in a few minutes.
[00:25:29.847 --> 00:25:32.447]  You don't have to put them on yet.
[00:25:32.467 --> 00:25:32.747]  You're good?
[00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:33.287]  Okay, good.
[00:25:34.388 --> 00:25:36.468]  Okay, folks, we are back live.
[00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:37.108]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:38.429]  It's real talk radio.
[00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:39.829]  Real issues, real significance.
[00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:42.640]  That actually affects you and your family.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.201]  And it's real.
[00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:45.121]  We're not putting on acts.
[00:25:45.161 --> 00:25:46.342]  We're going wild for freedom.
[00:25:46.762 --> 00:25:47.742]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:25:47.802 --> 00:25:51.724]  Steve, Joe, Mike, Mathis, and Daniel will at least get to those for George Humphrey.
[00:25:52.064 --> 00:25:53.505]  Okay, George, I want to go through
[00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:56.526]  Some issues.
[00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:59.287]  I went and interviewed you at your home for the film and I forgot a few questions.
[00:26:00.268 --> 00:26:03.030]  We went to dinner and you made some other good points afterwards that I wanted to have in the film.
[00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.853]  But first off, just for the radio audience, explain to people.
[00:26:07.873 --> 00:26:09.954]  We went and looked at the numbers again just to make sure.
[00:26:09.974 --> 00:26:14.217]  He's less than 10% at six point something black.
[00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:16.419]  And it doesn't matter if he's black or Chinese or whatever.
[00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:18.240]  It's that they're lying.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.681]  Everything about him is a lie.
[00:26:19.901 --> 00:26:20.862]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:21.342 --> 00:26:29.066]  And you don't care, I don't care whether he's black or white or Asian or Latin.
[00:26:29.186 --> 00:26:35.869]  What I want is a president and elected officials that are honest, that are independent, and that follow the Constitution.
[00:26:36.229 --> 00:26:36.609]  Period.
[00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:37.189]  Paragraph.
[00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.070]  End of story.
[00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.351]  And what does bother me is dishonesty.
[00:26:42.192 --> 00:26:47.955]  And over and over and over and over again, in just this last couple days in the Washington Post,
[00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:54.940]  Obama is this black man, first black president, da-da, da-da, and because he's black, we're okay.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.883]  The reality is, he's 50% Anglo and Caucasian, and he's 43.5% Arab and 6.5% African.
[00:27:09.517 --> 00:27:10.398]  Which is great.
[00:27:10.438 --> 00:27:11.699]  He's a man of mixed color.
[00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:13.320]  That's fine.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.622]  But he is not a black man anymore.
[00:27:16.022 --> 00:27:18.864]  I think that Alex has a little bit of Native American in him.
[00:27:19.365 --> 00:27:21.526]  And do we call Alex a Native American?
[00:27:22.187 --> 00:27:22.387]  No.
[00:27:22.667 --> 00:27:25.910]  He's proud of having that Native blood in him.
[00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.311]  But we don't talk about that.
[00:27:28.431 --> 00:27:43.600]  It is, and the reason that they're doing it is to create this screen, to create this illusion, to cement real African Americans to Obama and to create an untouchable point of view with the liberal Democrats.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.282]  Friends, this is one more lie.
[00:27:49.229 --> 00:27:50.049]  Very well said.
[00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:58.993]  Okay, the issue of... You told that story when we were at dinner about the lady heard you at a coffee shop.
[00:27:59.013 --> 00:27:59.973]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:59.993 --> 00:28:01.053]  So tell the whole story in detail.
[00:28:01.093 --> 00:28:06.355]  Well, I think the most important thing is that, you know, for years we've had the facts on our side.
[00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:13.038]  You know, we've got thousands and thousands of pages of facts of how we're being ripped off and destroyed as a country.
[00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:25.099]  But the question is, if we're really going to win, if we're really going to restore the Republic, we have to realize that it's more than facts, and that we have to deal with the emotions and the perceptions of the people.
[00:28:26.502 --> 00:28:31.704]  And quite clearly, quite clearly, the people of this country have been brainwashed.
[00:28:32.304 --> 00:28:39.147]  And right now, I would assume that about one-third of the people are just blindly supporting Obama.
[00:28:39.227 --> 00:28:45.130]  About one-third are undecided, and about one-third were McCain or Republicans.
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.791]  By the way, that's the actual numbers.
[00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:49.033]  You had, what, 60% turnout?
[00:28:49.393 --> 00:28:51.214]  He got, like, 57% of the vote.
[00:28:51.514 --> 00:28:58.839]  So if you calculate that out of the nation, he's got about a third of the people at the time of election, a little bit more than a third, supporting him.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.821]  And now that's eroded, so it's less than a third.
[00:29:01.181 --> 00:29:08.783]  And it is eroding very quickly, and yet he does have this base of just blind, blind obedient people.
[00:29:09.244 --> 00:29:19.087]  And it was kind of interesting, the other day I was in a cough shop and I was talking to a buddy about Gettner and about Goldman Sachs and about AIG and about the transfer of wealth.
[00:29:19.947 --> 00:29:24.351]  And this lady comes up and she was not part of the conversation.
[00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:27.214]  She puts her head and she says, I love Obama.
[00:29:27.674 --> 00:29:29.556]  This is a white woman, very well dressed.
[00:29:30.196 --> 00:29:31.838]  And we and I go, OK, great.
[00:29:32.518 --> 00:29:33.920]  Do you support the war in Iraq?
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:34.640]  No.
[00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:38.343]  Do you think that we should send more troops into Afghanistan?
[00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:39.424]  No.
[00:29:39.864 --> 00:29:41.245]  Well, and I said, Obama's.
[00:29:41.706 --> 00:29:42.366]  I'm against that.
[00:29:42.807 --> 00:29:46.329]  I said, are you, did you, was Obama a candidate for peace?
[00:29:46.449 --> 00:29:47.690]  She said, you bet he was!
[00:29:48.151 --> 00:29:52.934]  I said, are you aware that he's putting missiles in Poland, Ukraine and Georgia?
[00:29:53.515 --> 00:30:00.100]  And when she realized that we were dealing with facts, with real issues, not emotions,
[00:30:01.739 --> 00:30:04.601]  She goes, well, he's better than Bush, he's better than Bush.
[00:30:04.621 --> 00:30:07.624]  And we just sat there and went, we're not talking about Bush.
[00:30:07.684 --> 00:30:09.585]  This is not about Bush versus Obama.
[00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:10.946]  We didn't support Bush.
[00:30:12.054 --> 00:30:16.139]  And then she goes, well, I do all this reading.
[00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:18.421]  I said, well, why don't you look in here and here?
[00:30:18.601 --> 00:30:20.143]  She says, I can't do that.
[00:30:20.283 --> 00:30:20.964]  I can't do that.
[00:30:21.224 --> 00:30:23.787]  And then her voice goes way up.
[00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:25.909]  She says, you're trying to tell me what to do.
[00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:31.636]  And it's because psychologically she could not accept that
[00:30:32.518 --> 00:30:36.979]  What her investment of her time and energy was not in the right place.
[00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:44.461]  And so, in a very deep emotional place, she blocked off and she became very offensive.
[00:30:44.881 --> 00:30:52.123]  We went fine, and the funny thing was that she walks out and gets in a Cadillac Escalade.
[00:30:53.023 --> 00:30:55.723]  I mean, this big SUV Cadillac.
[00:30:55.804 --> 00:30:57.924]  I mean, you talk about a limousine liberal.
[00:30:58.464 --> 00:31:01.505]  And, you know, these people are absolutely
[00:31:02.739 --> 00:31:10.102]  Stealing her money, stealing her family's money, but she has it in her mind that this guy is the savior.
[00:31:10.803 --> 00:31:11.823]  And there's many people.
[00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:16.885]  Bush had his same cadre who supported him the same way, and it took a while.
[00:31:17.245 --> 00:31:25.109]  But very, very quickly, the truth is getting out there, and we're breaking through the illusion that this guy is the savior.
[00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:31.305]  And once we've discredited both the left and the right, the pattern of control and the false paradigm is shattered.
[00:31:31.605 --> 00:31:34.267]  Now we can move on to going after the real problem, the globalist bankers.
[00:31:34.328 --> 00:31:42.095]  Now, you know, getting back to their psychology, she made it about, you're trying to control me, you're trying to tell me what to do.
[00:31:42.736 --> 00:31:46.199]  Then it became very childlike, like, you know, I'm taking my ball and going home.
[00:31:47.694 --> 00:31:56.856]  When she had come over and she had gotten in George Humphrey's face about this, and I've noticed a lot of Obama people are saying, yeah, he is bad, but he's better than Bush.
[00:31:57.216 --> 00:31:58.136]  That isn't what it's about.
[00:31:58.176 --> 00:31:59.177]  It's that he's a puppet.
[00:31:59.677 --> 00:32:02.037]  It isn't about him being better than Bush.
[00:32:02.397 --> 00:32:07.879]  And being better than Bush just means he's better at conning and suckering people to go along with the agenda.
[00:32:09.266 --> 00:32:18.798]  Constant lying, and sometimes people can't get lying about lobbyists, or lying about wars, or lying about bailout money, or lying about saying he's against the bonuses when he wrote the executive order for them.
[00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:23.804]  I mean, clearly this guy is a congenital liar, the worst I've ever seen, and he's only getting started.
[00:32:23.824 --> 00:32:25.106]  I mean, this is an unbelievable new level.
[00:32:26.107 --> 00:32:28.049]  He walks up to the King of Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:30.371]  He bows completely down.
[00:32:30.411 --> 00:32:31.291]  I mean, where he's straight.
[00:32:31.712 --> 00:32:33.073]  I mean, completely prostrate.
[00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:37.657]  Complete supplication or minion behavior.
[00:32:38.217 --> 00:32:39.879]  The international media points this out.
[00:32:40.239 --> 00:32:41.140]  The Saudis love it.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.382]  You know, the Saudi leadership, the newspapers say, how great.
[00:32:45.421 --> 00:32:49.663]  And then he lies, and I have the press reports, the White House says, oh, the President had dropped something.
[00:32:50.044 --> 00:32:55.647]  And then there's clear video, he walks up, he takes his hand and then completely bows.
[00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:59.909]  He's not picking anything up, there's clear video of it and photos from all different angles.
[00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:08.394]  Then he said, oh, you know what, the prince is so short, or the king is so short, Obama had to bend down to shake his hand.
[00:33:08.474 --> 00:33:09.835]  Another lie, they're right on the same level.
[00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:12.357]  He gets his hand and then bows.
[00:33:13.382 --> 00:33:15.682]  And so, I mean, what is it that people don't get?
[00:33:15.722 --> 00:33:40.267]  Then he goes before, before that, Prince Philip, and he's saying, oh, I met with a world leader, and he says, oh, and Prince Philip laughs and says, oh, you can tell the difference, and starts laughing and then goes, and Obama says, uh, yes sir, and turns around, CNN put up fake subtitles where they're saying, oh, wonderful day, very successful, when you can clearly hear, and the Russian news got this right, and so did British, he's clearly saying to him, uh, that, uh,
[00:33:40.507 --> 00:33:43.989]  You know, making fun of him and saying, turn around, and Obama says, absolutely, yes.
[00:33:44.729 --> 00:33:45.570]  So speak to that.
[00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.712]  I mean, all the other world leaders aren't bowing to the royalty.
[00:33:49.072 --> 00:33:50.873]  This is about humiliating America.
[00:33:51.193 --> 00:33:53.574]  This is about humiliating us.
[00:33:53.594 --> 00:33:55.515]  This is about, we're bowing, we're slaves.
[00:33:55.815 --> 00:34:00.278]  Our president is like a tinker toy that the royals of the planet have bought at auction.
[00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:07.143]  And once again, this goes back to that wonderful document called the Constitution of the United States.
[00:34:07.623 --> 00:34:16.409]  And our founding fathers made it very clear that we were not supposed to have royalty or aristocracy within our government.
[00:34:16.769 --> 00:34:19.912]  They were breaking away from that old paradigm.
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:26.037]  They made it very clear that you're not supposed to have aristocracy within our government.
[00:34:26.358 --> 00:34:36.488]  And that also means that our leaders are not supposed to be bowing to the Prince Philip or the Prince of Saudi Arabia or whatever.
[00:34:36.988 --> 00:34:39.671]  Show them courteous respect.
[00:34:41.107 --> 00:34:42.888]  Just like you do with any other leader.
[00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:51.331]  But we don't bow to a prince from Saudi Arabia that was created a hundred years ago, or to a false king from England.
[00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:53.672]  This is just insanity.
[00:34:54.112 --> 00:34:59.915]  And the reality is, the reality is, is that the Royal Family of England
[00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.612]  is one of the top members or players within the Illuminati.
[00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:12.976]  And friends, all you have to do is look at how Obama is acting with those people.
[00:35:13.136 --> 00:35:15.157]  Deferring, giving away.
[00:35:15.177 --> 00:35:17.978]  He's the President of the United States.
[00:35:18.319 --> 00:35:20.960]  He is not the Prince of England.
[00:35:21.636 --> 00:35:24.820]  Well, expanding on that, it's a room full of world leaders.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.661]  None of them are bowing.
[00:35:25.762 --> 00:35:28.746]  Obama walks up, takes his hand, and completely bows.
[00:35:29.887 --> 00:35:32.250]  This is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.
[00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.792]  This is about our humiliation.
[00:35:34.153 --> 00:35:35.975]  Then he lies about his slaves.
[00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:39.318]  Just like he says, I'm not for a carbon tax, and he's for it.
[00:35:39.338 --> 00:35:42.161]  And he says, I'm not for putting satellite tracker boxes in your car, but they're for it.
[00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:44.323]  Or, I'm not going to hire lobbyists, but they're for it.
[00:35:44.563 --> 00:35:45.123]  Let's go ahead.
[00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:47.285]  This is from Spanish TV in Spain.
[00:35:47.826 --> 00:35:51.108]  This has Spanish behind it, but for those watching PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it.
[00:35:51.409 --> 00:35:52.690]  If not, you're listening on the radio.
[00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.132]  We have the YouTube video up on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:55.392 --> 00:35:59.595]  Then the next clip, I believe we have that too, is him groveling to Prince Philip and the Queen of England.
[00:35:59.636 --> 00:35:59.876]  Here it is.
[00:36:00.646 --> 00:36:01.447]  Yes, I think.
[00:36:26.091 --> 00:36:37.025]  Hey, I just want to say is that years ago when I was a city councilman, Prince Charles came to Austin, Texas and I had the pleasure of meeting him.
[00:36:37.285 --> 00:36:40.389]  We had a nice talk, but I never bowed to that son of a gun.
[00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.410]  I liked him.
[00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.531]  Go ahead and call him a son of a bitch.
[00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:45.173]  Well, no, he's just, you know... He's a nice man.
[00:36:45.213 --> 00:36:52.698]  On a personal level, he was very charming, and we had a nice talk about horses, but I wasn't going to bow to some guy like that.
[00:36:52.838 --> 00:36:54.279]  I mean, I like him.
[00:36:54.419 --> 00:37:06.627]  Well, that's what Albert Speer, the head of the Ministry of the Interior for Germany said, he got off at Nuremberg, but he said, when you're standing next to the devil and he's so charming, he's got his arm around it, you don't know it's the devil.
[00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:07.267]  Absolutely.
[00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:10.989]  And LBJ was probably one of the most charming people in the whole world.
[00:37:11.489 --> 00:37:12.950]  Now, was LBJ a good guy?
[00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.290]  Well, that's up to you.
[00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:21.294]  But, you know, just because somebody is charming, like Barack Obama, it doesn't mean that they're telling you the truth.
[00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:23.215]  Well, what humiliation for our country.
[00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:28.497]  Now, here is the video and audio where... The point is CNN put fake subtitles in here.
[00:37:29.884 --> 00:37:34.147]  Okay, they put in the fake subtitles of, oh, then it's going very well, it's very excellent.
[00:37:34.707 --> 00:37:39.170]  And then meanwhile he really said, oh, you can tell the difference, then laughs at him and then goes, meh.
[00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:40.951]  Okay, now here it is.
[00:37:43.084 --> 00:37:50.927]  The Chinese, the Russians, David Cameron, and I'm proud to say I'm not off in any way.
[00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:53.208]  Can you tell the difference?
[00:37:53.488 --> 00:37:54.649]  It's all over.
[00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:57.030]  Of course, of course.
[00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.512]  Prince Philip suggested with a laugh that maybe Dick should go to the U.S.
[00:38:02.532 --> 00:38:04.273]  President to tell them apart.
[00:38:06.085 --> 00:38:07.507]  We're good to go.
[00:38:07.527 --> 00:38:09.329]  We're good to go.
[00:38:26.062 --> 00:38:33.088]  Prince Philip is notorious for his inappropriate jokes sometimes, which often offend minorities and foreigners.
[00:38:33.628 --> 00:38:45.018]  For example, on a visit to Beijing some years ago, he described it as a ghastly town and told British students living in the city if they stayed much longer, they would become slitty-eyed.
[00:38:46.414 --> 00:38:49.435]  Hey, a picture's worth a thousand words.
[00:38:49.515 --> 00:38:50.916]  All you have to do is watch it.
[00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:19.045]  But then Obama lies and says he doesn't bow to the King of Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:19.565]  Does he bow?
[00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.106]  Of course he does.
[00:39:21.146 --> 00:39:22.266]  Just look at the pictures.
[00:39:23.587 --> 00:39:24.387]  It's really funny.
[00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:38.694]  I mean, at one level... I mean, it's like a theater battle where you go... It's absolutely ridiculous that the President of the United States is bowing to this false prince in Saudi Arabia and this false king and queen in England.
[00:39:38.894 --> 00:39:40.115]  I mean, it's just wild.
[00:39:41.936 --> 00:39:43.156]  We're not worthy!
[00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:44.717]  We're not worthy!
[00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:50.352]  Man, talk about the creation of feudalism again.
[00:39:50.752 --> 00:39:51.492]  But you know what?
[00:39:51.712 --> 00:39:52.572]  We're not going to do it.
[00:39:52.752 --> 00:39:54.113]  We're not going to go back that way.
[00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:55.593]  Alright, let's take some ring-a-dingy.
[00:39:55.613 --> 00:39:57.954]  So, Steve in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:39:58.014 --> 00:39:58.714]  Welcome, Steve.
[00:39:59.554 --> 00:40:03.315]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex and George, and God bless both of you.
[00:40:03.335 --> 00:40:05.215]  I appreciate the stand that you've taken.
[00:40:05.976 --> 00:40:07.816]  I just wanted to give you a heads-up.
[00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:11.737]  Something I heard on Glenn Beck's show this morning, but before that, Alex, I wanted to let you know,
[00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:16.566]  Personal testimony, I got the Obama deception and I let a neighbor of mine borrow it.
[00:40:16.987 --> 00:40:20.830]  This guy's black, real good guy, young guy with a wife and five kids.
[00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:25.355]  Let him watch it and before I asked him, did you vote in the last election?
[00:40:25.555 --> 00:40:26.076]  Well, no.
[00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:27.877]  Well, if you had, who do you voted for?
[00:40:27.977 --> 00:40:29.259]  Well, the guy that's in now.
[00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:31.901]  So I gave him a bunch of information, let him watch it.
[00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:36.526]  He came back to me after watching it twice, said he passed it on to his mother.
[00:40:37.065 --> 00:40:40.633]  Who was an ardent Obama supporter, as well as the rest of his family.
[00:40:40.673 --> 00:40:41.896]  He has a bunch of people.
[00:40:42.217 --> 00:40:44.923]  So now she's talking to her sister, his aunt.
[00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:51.410]  And a bunch of other people, and so he's gonna go and get the Obama... He said, man, I gotta get copies of this.
[00:40:51.430 --> 00:41:05.857]  I gave him your website, told him where to go, and I mean, that's what we've gotta do, because just like you're saying, when people see this, if they have any kind of an open mind, and they're using the brain God gave them, and he said this, all you gotta do is look at what's on the news.
[00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:12.820]  All they're saying is what's on the news, and his aunt had said, oh, that's just the Republicans putting that out, you know, and she hadn't even seen it.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.661]  So, you know, but that's what we've got to do.
[00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:20.264]  It'll go viral if each one of us does our part.
[00:41:20.424 --> 00:41:23.926]  Bottom line, they want to betray folks that supported Obama.
[00:41:24.146 --> 00:41:27.208]  When they're done, they're going to blame everything on him, and the new order keeps moving.
[00:41:27.228 --> 00:41:27.448]  Right.
[00:41:27.628 --> 00:41:29.889]  We're trying to help folks that have been suckered by this.
[00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.450]  We're all in this together.
[00:41:32.071 --> 00:41:36.913]  And all the emails I get that are against me, it's all, you're just a Republican.
[00:41:37.134 --> 00:41:37.374]  Right.
[00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:38.554]  And they don't understand.
[00:41:38.714 --> 00:41:39.015]  No.
[00:41:39.295 --> 00:41:41.256]  But tell me what Mr. Beck was doing.
[00:41:41.821 --> 00:41:44.042]  Okay, I listened to his radio show this morning.
[00:41:44.062 --> 00:41:48.383]  Of course, I always have to listen to it with my nose plugged, or I'll throw up.
[00:41:48.623 --> 00:41:50.464]  And anyway, here's what he said.
[00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:51.164]  I turned it on.
[00:41:51.284 --> 00:41:54.565]  Right after I turned it on, it was going into a second hour, he said this.
[00:41:54.925 --> 00:41:59.587]  Now, you know about he's going to be at that rally in San Antonio that Burmese is talking about going to.
[00:41:59.947 --> 00:42:00.847]  Well, he said this.
[00:42:00.927 --> 00:42:09.070]  He knows there's going to be people there, and he didn't name anybody, but he said, if you're planning on bringing any signs, do not bring them.
[00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.990]  And he said,
[00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:14.414]  There's people trying to make this all about me, and this isn't about me.
[00:42:14.494 --> 00:42:15.515]  It's about our freedom.
[00:42:15.875 --> 00:42:26.565]  And he said, I had to tell the people who are holding this rally that I had to respectfully say I will be there, but I will not be going up on stage to be the keynote speaker.
[00:42:28.527 --> 00:42:45.713]  Well, I mean, all we're going to do is send Burmas peacefully to hand out DVDs we're having to author and make that just show congressional hearings about FEMA camps and FEMA documents, and we're just going to go, here, please, the FEMA camps are real, the FEMA camps are real, and the wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:42:47.854 --> 00:42:48.814]  We can't!
[00:42:48.955 --> 00:42:49.795]  I'm canceling!
[00:42:49.895 --> 00:42:50.475]  Abort!
[00:42:50.895 --> 00:42:51.395]  Abort!
[00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:53.736]  Okay, somebody's got to find us that clip.
[00:42:53.776 --> 00:42:54.337]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:54.357 --> 00:42:55.137]  Did he say anything else, sir?
[00:42:56.426 --> 00:43:04.608]  Uh, no, but I just wanted to say, Alex, if you look at what he says about his show, it's the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[00:43:06.248 --> 00:43:09.089]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.
[00:43:09.609 --> 00:43:16.791]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[00:43:17.331 --> 00:43:24.513]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:31.505]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[00:43:32.085 --> 00:43:38.570]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:43:38.851 --> 00:43:41.172]  Beware, be smart, and be ready.
[00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:47.477]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at HempUSA.org.
[00:43:48.018 --> 00:43:53.822]  Families need this high-quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[00:43:54.346 --> 00:43:57.908]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[00:43:58.308 --> 00:44:04.711]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[00:44:06.092 --> 00:44:11.414]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:18.878]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:44:19.483 --> 00:44:25.649]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:27.911]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:28.051 --> 00:44:30.453]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:41.504]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:42.111 --> 00:44:43.392]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:43.792 --> 00:44:45.173]  It's about a one world government.
[00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:51.977]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:52.558 --> 00:45:00.343]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:01.964]  The Obama Deception.
[00:45:02.384 --> 00:45:03.585]  The people strike back.
[00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:07.780]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.624]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:45:11.724 --> 00:45:14.387]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:21.754]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:45:21.874 --> 00:45:26.879]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[00:45:26.959 --> 00:45:31.924]  You'll lose on your capital investment, and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:38.191]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:42.333]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:47.456]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnovel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:45:48.276 --> 00:45:53.199]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:45:53.319 --> 00:45:57.061]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:45:57.781 --> 00:46:00.263]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:46:00.423 --> 00:46:00.863]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.226]  We're good.
[00:46:17.782 --> 00:46:27.245]  All right, I'm going to have George with us five minutes to the next hour, then we're going to have continual information with a real chemtrail expert in light of the White House saying they're going to start looking at spraying the skies.
[00:46:27.265 --> 00:46:28.425]  They've already done the studies.
[00:46:28.445 --> 00:46:29.386]  Already doing it.
[00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:29.846]  Right.
[00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:33.127]  Oh, we've been looking at wiretapping without warrants for decades.
[00:46:33.147 --> 00:46:34.067]  We've been doing it.
[00:46:34.227 --> 00:46:36.228]  We've been looking with studies in chemtrailing.
[00:46:36.608 --> 00:46:38.569]  That's in the Associated Press, Lennon Guardian.
[00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.709]  Look at this.
[00:46:40.029 --> 00:46:41.169]  We get emails like this all the time.
[00:46:41.209 --> 00:46:45.771]  It says, just wanted to let you know, I'm currently in northern Iraq working in the oil industry.
[00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.273]  But I was in a local DVD shop, and guess what I see on the shelf?
[00:46:49.653 --> 00:46:51.915]  Yes, that is correct, the Obama deception in all its glory.
[00:46:52.396 --> 00:46:59.042]  I just thought that I would let you know, and you can let your listeners know, that the movie is getting around the world, and not just via the internet and YouTube.
[00:46:59.382 --> 00:47:00.684]  Take care, and keep up the great work.
[00:47:00.944 --> 00:47:02.846]  And that's why we have PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:03.326 --> 00:47:07.811]  Because you can download super high quality versions that are almost as good as a regular DVD.
[00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:08.872]  Super high quality.
[00:47:08.912 --> 00:47:10.053]  And burn them to disk.
[00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:15.155]  Because most DVD players now play regular CDs.
[00:47:15.636 --> 00:47:20.120]  You know, they're like 20 cents a piece and people are just making copies fiendishly.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.421]  I mean, this is explosive.
[00:47:22.222 --> 00:47:23.023]  Well, absolutely.
[00:47:23.063 --> 00:47:25.845]  And again, information is power.
[00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:32.732]  And if we are to survive, if we are to endure, if we are to bring back this republic,
[00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:52.613]  We have to become aware that this false issue about left versus right is just an illusion and that we do this with information and that this particular video, the Obama deception, is the most powerful video that I have ever seen
[00:47:53.413 --> 00:48:13.704]  for waking people up in the time is right now and that's not hard folks this is the film the white folks have been in and i love it i mean you've got in in and what i really love is that the start of the movie you have the not one but you have two different very very articulate black rappers who are speaking their mind who are speaking their truth and that is it
[00:48:14.164 --> 00:48:15.365]  Incredibly important.
[00:48:15.385 --> 00:48:20.088]  You have Jesse Ventura, you have Willie Nelson, you have Celente.
[00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:28.014]  I mean, you have folks on there who are articulate, they've got a sense of humor, they have clarity, and they have vision.
[00:48:28.294 --> 00:48:29.655]  And they're speaking to the people.
[00:48:29.695 --> 00:48:34.178]  They're not speaking down to people, they're speaking about what is true and good.
[00:48:34.198 --> 00:48:35.960]  No, it's shot like in a coffee table discussion.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.841]  And it's not even really attacking Obama.
[00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:39.102]  It's saying, it doesn't even matter, he's a puppet.
[00:48:39.122 --> 00:48:40.102]  Yeah, it's not about Obama.
[00:48:40.142 --> 00:48:41.143]  Obama's a puppet.
[00:48:41.343 --> 00:48:42.604]  And it's just not about Bush or Clinton.
[00:48:42.624 --> 00:48:46.026]  But that's what it's about, is showing you that it's a fake fight.
[00:48:46.386 --> 00:48:48.147]  Let's talk to Joe in New Mexico.
[00:48:48.167 --> 00:48:49.008]  You're on the air with George Humphrey.
[00:48:49.028 --> 00:48:49.488]  Go ahead, Joe.
[00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:52.490]  Hey, Joe.
[00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:56.412]  George, I really agree with George on that Obama deception assessment.
[00:48:56.432 --> 00:48:56.973]  That's great.
[00:48:57.113 --> 00:49:00.695]  And real quick, Alex, man, you are doing good work.
[00:49:00.975 --> 00:49:02.456]  And I know it's not about you.
[00:49:02.656 --> 00:49:05.258]  It's obvious when you talk to people, even some of your
[00:49:05.928 --> 00:49:07.249]  Interesting calls that come in.
[00:49:07.289 --> 00:49:08.250]  You're always polite.
[00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:08.950]  You're genuine.
[00:49:09.611 --> 00:49:11.392]  And you're always focused on the issues.
[00:49:11.692 --> 00:49:16.476]  Well, sir, I mean, I'm living with death threats every day and stuff that I don't even get into on air.
[00:49:16.516 --> 00:49:17.797]  I mean, that makes it real.
[00:49:17.837 --> 00:49:18.777]  This isn't about ego.
[00:49:18.977 --> 00:49:19.618]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[00:49:19.638 --> 00:49:22.680]  When I first got into this, like, 14 years ago, I didn't like tyranny.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.021]  I wanted to keep the Second Amendment.
[00:49:24.321 --> 00:49:27.223]  But it's fun to be known, fun to get up, and, you know, you're supposed to.
[00:49:27.484 --> 00:49:27.964]  It's normal.
[00:49:28.204 --> 00:49:28.664]  But now...
[00:49:29.705 --> 00:49:34.327]  Now it's just pure passion for liberty and freedom, and it's not about me.
[00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:38.088]  More than ego now, though, it's also about defeating enemies.
[00:49:38.528 --> 00:49:39.808]  People that have tried to stop me.
[00:49:40.249 --> 00:49:42.089]  It's more than just a competitiveness now.
[00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.671]  In a way it's like a prison, but at the same time it's empowering.
[00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:47.531]  It's yin-yang.
[00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:48.391]  George, you know what I'm talking about?
[00:49:48.411 --> 00:49:49.092]  Well, heck yeah.
[00:49:49.192 --> 00:49:52.473]  I mean, I remember when I first became aware of this about 20 years ago.
[00:49:53.693 --> 00:49:58.496]  My jaw just dropped and I realized, Kyle, if I go into this, I'll never be a U.S.
[00:49:58.576 --> 00:49:59.396]  I won't be a U.S.
[00:49:59.436 --> 00:50:00.497]  Congressman right now.
[00:50:01.157 --> 00:50:03.078]  I'll alienate a lot of my friends.
[00:50:03.538 --> 00:50:08.801]  And then, as I made the decision to tell the truth, then I start finding all these new friends.
[00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:13.383]  And my life became better and more vibrant and aware.
[00:50:13.963 --> 00:50:20.627]  Now clearly, there are many nights that I wake up and I'm in a sweat, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't change a thing.
[00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:23.061]  Yeah, I know.
[00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:27.202]  But then it's real when you're holding your children and you're looking at the beautiful stars and trees.
[00:50:27.922 --> 00:50:35.143]  When you're not risking your life and not challenging evil, we're meant to do that in this life, you're not going to the next level.
[00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:41.625]  And, you know, when you face your fear and go in through beyond, past the fear, then you actually go to the next level.
[00:50:41.945 --> 00:50:43.685]  And that's what I want people to experience.
[00:50:43.705 --> 00:50:44.325]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:48.486]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:51.488 --> 00:50:53.729]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:56.370]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.371]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:57.491 --> 00:51:02.112]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:51:02.213 --> 00:51:04.974]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:05.194 --> 00:51:08.055]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:08.215 --> 00:51:12.937]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:13.177 --> 00:51:14.118]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:14.298 --> 00:51:17.261]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:24.447]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:24.527 --> 00:51:27.670]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.192]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com

[00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:46.782]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.511]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:00.991 --> 00:52:03.713]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.782]  Alright, final segment with George Humphrey in studio with us.
[00:52:26.842 --> 00:52:29.704]  We got Chemtrail Exposé coming out.
[00:52:29.724 --> 00:52:30.665]  A lot of new developments there.
[00:52:30.685 --> 00:52:40.733]  If your friends and family don't know about Chemtrail, tell them to tune in right now on your local M&M's station or at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com on the free streams or download the free podcast.
[00:52:40.994 --> 00:52:45.497]  It's in the free podcast in the show to your friends and family in the listen page at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:46.078 --> 00:52:47.959]  Let's talk quickly to Mike in Boston.
[00:52:47.999 --> 00:52:49.501]  Mike, you're on the air with George Humphrey.
[00:52:51.542 --> 00:52:52.083]  Yes sir.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.061]  I'm a private detective.
[00:52:54.081 --> 00:52:57.383]  We talked last week, and I called in about the change of the police.
[00:52:58.264 --> 00:53:08.192]  I just wanted to give you a heads up that over the 15 years of being a PI, over the past, I don't know, maybe six years, I've got hours and hours of chemtrail that I want to send you.
[00:53:09.934 --> 00:53:11.815]  They're just, it's huge.
[00:53:11.895 --> 00:53:12.736]  I see them every day.
[00:53:13.276 --> 00:53:16.359]  And I've passed out about 75 copies of your film.
[00:53:16.899 --> 00:53:22.364]  I'm in police departments and courthouses at least five days out of the week, and I'm dropping them everywhere.
[00:53:23.151 --> 00:53:23.791]  Well, good job.
[00:53:23.851 --> 00:53:25.793]  It's unstoppable if folks just keep doing it.
[00:53:26.213 --> 00:53:28.715]  Are you getting any feedback, or are you just firing and forgetting?
[00:53:30.176 --> 00:53:38.522]  I'm getting some feedback from some of the police officers, and most of them agree with me, but there's quite a few that
[00:53:39.557 --> 00:53:40.998]  Just really give me an attitude.
[00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:47.364]  Ask me politely not to leave any more at the station or with any of the officers.
[00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:50.846]  It's almost like they don't want me educating anybody.
[00:53:50.866 --> 00:53:51.667]  Oh, God forbid!
[00:53:51.747 --> 00:53:54.429]  I mean, how dare you try to communicate with another human?
[00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:55.670]  This is un-American!
[00:53:56.331 --> 00:54:01.876]  But the Chemtrail videos, I got your information of where I need to send them, but Alex, I've got a ton of them.
[00:54:01.896 --> 00:54:05.759]  I mean, just recently, last week, from Waterbury, Connecticut,
[00:54:06.287 --> 00:54:09.849]  All the way to about mid-Milbury, Massachusetts.
[00:54:09.949 --> 00:54:11.190]  Midway on the Pike Pike.
[00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:13.231]  You're talking about an hour and a half drive.
[00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:17.614]  It was just six planes doing criss-cross patterns.
[00:54:17.874 --> 00:54:18.514]  Unbelievable.
[00:54:18.895 --> 00:54:20.616]  I pulled over on the side of the highway.
[00:54:20.676 --> 00:54:23.577]  State Trooper pulled up, asked me what I was doing, and I showed him.
[00:54:23.978 --> 00:54:24.578]  Said, look up.
[00:54:24.978 --> 00:54:27.880]  He says he sees them all the time, but he just had no idea what it was.
[00:54:28.595 --> 00:54:35.305]  Well, now you can send him to the Council on Foreign Relations at WhiteHouse.gov and they said, yeah, we're looking at doing this.
[00:54:35.365 --> 00:54:39.912]  And then you read the documents, oh, we've been doing it for years, testing, but now we're going to make it public.
[00:54:40.293 --> 00:54:43.258]  And they said, worldwide, for your safety.
[00:54:44.454 --> 00:54:45.434]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:54:45.674 --> 00:54:48.295]  But I really want to thank the caller here.
[00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:54.977]  The fact that you're going into police stations, the fact that you have the courage to speak to these people and give them this information.
[00:54:55.497 --> 00:54:57.158]  And let's say that you put out ten.
[00:54:57.618 --> 00:55:01.899]  If only one of them watches it and gets the message, you've done your work.
[00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:04.680]  And I want to say this to everybody listening.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:13.523]  Just today, go out and talk to somebody new about the New World Order, about chemtrails, about the bailout, and about the Obama deception.
[00:55:14.225 --> 00:55:14.986]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[00:55:15.026 --> 00:55:15.587]  God bless you.
[00:55:15.607 --> 00:55:19.072]  And be sure and write me notes about where it was, if you want to be sourced.
[00:55:19.312 --> 00:55:21.175]  Don't just send me a letter saying you have the rights to use it.
[00:55:21.415 --> 00:55:22.076]  You need to let me know.
[00:55:22.176 --> 00:55:23.739]  Do you want to be sourced in the film?
[00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:24.700]  Do you want to be thanked?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.863]  Do you want to be in the credits or do you not want it there?
[00:55:27.003 --> 00:55:30.348]  Be very careful about that because I know we're going to get hundreds of tapes sent in.
[00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:32.870]  I'm really excited about this Kim Trill film.
[00:55:33.771 --> 00:55:34.872]  It's going to be awesome.
[00:55:35.152 --> 00:55:38.975]  Because again, people can look up and it's eyes wide shut.
[00:55:39.155 --> 00:55:44.119]  And everybody that I get to look up, they go, yeah, I'm kind of aware of it.
[00:55:44.159 --> 00:55:45.420]  But most people don't look up.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.742]  But when they do, they realize something's wrong.
[00:55:47.922 --> 00:55:48.262]  Exactly.
[00:55:48.322 --> 00:55:48.803]  Real fast.
[00:55:48.863 --> 00:55:49.783]  Mathis in Texas.
[00:55:49.823 --> 00:55:50.564]  Mathis, go ahead.
[00:55:51.305 --> 00:55:51.885]  Yeah.
[00:55:52.265 --> 00:55:54.167]  First, I was trying to get to your screener.
[00:55:54.187 --> 00:55:57.029]  Some of your information about what other networks are available.
[00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:59.371]  I travel all through Texas throughout the day.
[00:56:00.492 --> 00:56:05.754]  I can only hear you when I'm in Austin, and when we're done, I'm wondering if you can send me over and let me know where else I might be able to hear you.
[00:56:05.774 --> 00:56:07.715]  Well, I just want to be clear, we don't have a call screener.
[00:56:08.776 --> 00:56:12.117]  Oh, well, the gentleman that was asking me questions when I first called.
[00:56:13.377 --> 00:56:14.938]  Well, we don't screen the calls.
[00:56:15.878 --> 00:56:18.359]  You mean when I called in, somebody asked me my name.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.700]  Yeah, well, that's not a call screener, just so you know.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:24.822]  I mean, you can use whatever name you'd like, but we didn't ask you what you wanted to talk about, did we?
[00:56:25.535 --> 00:56:26.236]  Oh, no, not at all.
[00:56:26.256 --> 00:56:26.616]  Not at all.
[00:56:26.656 --> 00:56:29.939]  He just... There's a big internet hoax claiming we do.
[00:56:29.959 --> 00:56:30.619]  Right.
[00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:32.221]  And it's all fake callers, they claim.
[00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:35.443]  But, you know, I just want to get that straight.
[00:56:35.724 --> 00:56:36.844]  We don't screen your phone calls.
[00:56:37.305 --> 00:56:40.067]  Unless I'm saying, oh, I want to hear from a police officer.
[00:56:40.868 --> 00:56:41.568]  Yeah.
[00:56:42.129 --> 00:56:45.351]  Well, by networks, sir, I'm only on about 65 radio stations.
[00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:46.132]  That sounds like a lot.
[00:56:46.172 --> 00:56:46.552]  It's not.
[00:56:47.834 --> 00:56:55.743]  I'm on the Genesis Network, the shortwave satellite and internet, and we only have three affiliates in Texas.
[00:56:56.724 --> 00:56:58.687]  So I'm glad you're trying to look for how to find us.
[00:56:58.707 --> 00:57:02.111]  Just get an iPod, download the free podcast every day at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:02.131 --> 00:57:02.872]  George, thanks for coming in.
[00:57:03.192 --> 00:57:03.573]  Thanks, buddy.
[00:57:03.773 --> 00:57:03.993]  You bet.
[00:57:04.013 --> 00:57:04.594]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:04.614 --> 00:57:04.954]  Stay with us.
[00:57:06.072 --> 00:57:07.333]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.393 --> 00:57:12.736]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:57:12.976 --> 00:57:17.598]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:57:17.998 --> 00:57:18.378]  It's true.
[00:57:18.479 --> 00:57:23.061]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:28.264]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:57:28.784 --> 00:57:30.665]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:57:31.092 --> 00:57:35.716]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:57:35.896 --> 00:57:36.797]  And here's the best part.
[00:57:37.017 --> 00:57:39.799]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:57:40.099 --> 00:57:43.402]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:57:43.702 --> 00:57:46.544]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:46.905 --> 00:57:48.786]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:49.126 --> 00:57:50.047]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:50.447]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:57:50.468 --> 00:57:51.368]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:58:00.205 --> 00:58:02.427]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:58:02.747 --> 00:58:05.189]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:11.654]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:12.174 --> 00:58:19.160]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:19.736 --> 00:58:25.918]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:28.159]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:28.299 --> 00:58:30.720]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:41.725]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:42.365 --> 00:58:43.665]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:44.045 --> 00:58:45.406]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:45.914 --> 00:58:52.238]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:52.818 --> 00:59:00.582]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:01.082 --> 00:59:02.223]  The Obama Deception.
[00:59:02.643 --> 00:59:03.844]  The people strike back.
[00:59:05.939 --> 00:59:09.321]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:14.684]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:14.864 --> 00:59:19.647]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:20.027 --> 00:59:31.154]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:37.098]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:43.383]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:44.243]  What about you?
[00:59:44.624 --> 00:59:50.668]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.000]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:13.721 --> 01:00:14.841]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:15.462 --> 01:00:16.282]  You want answers?
[01:00:17.062 --> 01:00:18.543]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:18.623 --> 01:00:22.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.805 --> 01:00:25.126]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:26.025 --> 01:00:26.866]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:51.068]  Okay, for those that are just now joining us, you have ice condensation clouds that normally form above 20,000 feet.
[01:00:53.362 --> 01:00:58.966]  When jet aircraft go through the right type of cloud formations, it just forms clouds, ice crystals.
[01:01:01.888 --> 01:01:09.933]  But starting in the mid-nineties, suddenly we notice clouds at only a few thousand feet, trails that would expand and turn into cloud banks.
[01:01:10.454 --> 01:01:12.415]  And then planes right next to them wouldn't leave it.
[01:01:14.436 --> 01:01:17.098]  And now people have done the deep research,
[01:01:18.695 --> 01:01:24.020]  You know, we have active climate stabilization particle physics-based approaches to prevention of climate change.
[01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:28.103]  A Nobel Prize was won a decade ago plus in this.
[01:01:28.924 --> 01:01:34.149]  This is the National Academy of Engineering Symposium, Washington, D.C., April 18, 2002.
[01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:38.573]  The Council on Foreign Relations that openly is calling for world government and globalism.
[01:01:40.782 --> 01:01:51.638]  has come out and admitted in a whole bunch of papers they've put out Council on Foreign Relations geoengineering workshop on unilateral planetary-scale geoengineering or terraforming
[01:01:53.018 --> 01:01:54.078]  There is that article.
[01:01:54.098 --> 01:01:59.860]  We're going to put all these up on screen as we go through the show today with our guest.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:14.405]  And then O'Brock Obama's head science advisor, in his first interviews as being approved a month ago, tells the Associated Press, London Guardian, and others in a press conference, I just want you to know we may have to start geoengineering with aircraft spraying the skies to protect us from global warming.
[01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:24.102]  Now, something is going on, and a lot of newscasters have done studies, they've had scientists look at it.
[01:02:24.702 --> 01:02:26.283]  There's more than one program going on.
[01:02:26.303 --> 01:02:28.364]  There's low-altitude spraying, high-altitude.
[01:02:28.784 --> 01:02:43.190]  You'll see articles in California where they spray pesticides on the town for a moth, or Austin, Texas, or they spray bacteria on every town and city in Oklahoma with a bacteria that kills mammals and causes spontaneous abortions, and then they just calmly announce.
[01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:46.452]  So there's all this stuff going on.
[01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:52.598]  And if you go to CaliforniaSkyWatch.com, it's one of the best, most well-researched interviews.
[01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:55.763]  Scientists, virologists, the list goes on and on.
[01:02:56.863 --> 01:02:58.784]  Rosalynn Peterson, we're going to have her on.
[01:02:58.804 --> 01:03:01.386]  We've had her on many times before, but I want to have her on next week again.
[01:03:01.426 --> 01:03:02.867]  An hour today is not enough.
[01:03:03.648 --> 01:03:08.531]  Rosalynn Peterson is a California president and co-founder of the Agriculture Defense Coalition.
[01:03:08.572 --> 01:03:18.719]  The ADC was founded in 2006 to protect agriculture crop production from uncontrolled experimental weather modification programs, atmospheric heating and testing programs, and oceanic and atmospheric experimental geoengineering programs.
[01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:45.251]  And the issue is, once you don't call it chemtrails, and you actually go look and use their terms, it's all over every major university out there, literally, they're spraying everywhere, they admit it, and NASA admits they're doing it, and the CFR is announcing it, and the President's people are announcing it, but then you tell the public, and they say it doesn't exist, like here's the Council on Foreign Relations, International Institutions and Global Governance Program, World Order 21st Century,
[01:03:47.185 --> 01:03:49.346]  May 1st, 2008, where they call for global government.
[01:03:49.847 --> 01:03:59.192]  I have here today the International Bank of Settlements documents from 2006, where they said they were engineering the collapse for 2009 to bring in the new world order.
[01:03:59.592 --> 01:04:02.574]  I mean, that's how this is piling up, where it's just everywhere.
[01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:03.735]  Like, where is that?
[01:04:03.755 --> 01:04:06.476]  I had that in my stack, and then Aaron ran off with it, and he's now on an airplane.
[01:04:06.936 --> 01:04:08.738]  Anyways, let's go ahead and go to Rosalind Peterson.
[01:04:09.058 --> 01:04:10.258]  Rosalind, start at the beginning.
[01:04:10.439 --> 01:04:15.321]  What we know, the documented stuff that's on record of what's happening.
[01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:16.082]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:04:17.199 --> 01:04:19.720]  Well, thank you very much for having me on your show today.
[01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:23.801]  There's any number of programs.
[01:04:24.522 --> 01:04:25.482]  NASA and the U.S.
[01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:45.389]  Air Force are conducting atmospheric heating and testing programs, and they're using space shuttle and rockets to send up canisters with toxic chemicals like barium and trimethylaluminum, strontium, lithium, sulfur hexafluoride, FF6, and other chemicals, and then they superheat these canisters
[01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:51.880]  And conduct atmospheric and ionospheric heating and testing programs.
[01:04:52.641 --> 01:04:57.344]  Then you've got weather modification programs ongoing across the United States.
[01:04:57.404 --> 01:05:00.066]  There's more than 60 listed by the U.S.
[01:05:00.126 --> 01:05:01.247]  Department of Commerce.
[01:05:01.888 --> 01:05:06.491]  And right now, our weather can be modified without our consent.
[01:05:06.571 --> 01:05:09.573]  They can use any chemicals and any experiments that they want.
[01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:14.237]  A private individual, a corporation, a state, a city, a county,
[01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:18.914]  The military, federal government, anyone can modify your weather at any time.
[01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:23.678]  They don't have to have any... There is no public oversight.
[01:05:23.738 --> 01:05:29.102]  There is no prior public notification, except in a few small counties in some states.
[01:05:29.903 --> 01:05:35.067]  And these programs are currently ongoing and growing exponentially.
[01:05:35.888 --> 01:05:41.313]  And now Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas has just introduced U.S.
[01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:41.773]  Senate Bill 601.
[01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:55.823]  To continue to allow anyone and everyone to mitigate and modify the weather, and they don't set up any government oversight, no prior public notification, there's nothing in this bill.
[01:05:56.484 --> 01:06:09.746]  Then you add these persistent jet contrails that turn into white haze, cirrus clouds, man-made clouds that NASA studies show exacerbate global warming,
[01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:16.355]  They show that they change our climate, and they're showing that they negatively impact natural resources.
[01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:17.556]  That was the point I was going to make.
[01:06:17.596 --> 01:06:19.257]  I've had top climatologists on.
[01:06:19.317 --> 01:06:30.546]  I remember, like, four years ago and seven years ago, NASA showed their own satellite photos of the whole US and Europe covered with the contrails, which are really chemtrails, as they didn't do this until this program started.
[01:06:31.306 --> 01:06:38.973]  This huge black-off project that's got to be in the hundreds of billions now, and they admitted that these clouds were going to heat the earth.
[01:06:39.053 --> 01:06:46.360]  So they're... I think they're trying to really screw stuff up so they can panic people into accepting the global warming tax.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:07:09.547]  Because now they come out and have, you know, in kids' textbooks, as you mentioned, as folks have covered, oh, we're trying to stop the global warming, and now the president's people are saying that, when the science shows that this stuff causes UV to go through the clouds and then basically trap the heat under them, that it's clear skies, like the desert at night, that let the heat go off-world.
[01:07:11.078 --> 01:07:12.198]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:07:12.518 --> 01:07:18.700]  And contrails, too, are made up of water vapor and, of course, debt fuel emissions and other toxics.
[01:07:19.281 --> 01:07:24.802]  But now they're saying that this water vapor is a greenhouse gas, and they say it exacerbates global warming.
[01:07:25.223 --> 01:07:33.805]  And yet, in no legislation that I can find anywhere at any level, state or federal, do they talk about remedying the problem or solving it.
[01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:38.927]  They're starting now to talk about, well, we can put up more particulates into the atmosphere.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.061]  And space mirrors, there's all kinds of geoengineering projects in order to cool us down.
[01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:50.343]  But they don't realize that the programs we have ongoing are what are exacerbating this problem.
[01:07:52.923 --> 01:07:54.064]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:07:54.124 --> 01:08:02.005]  And then there's just the whole issue of how this illustrates for people what the shadow government, which they now admit is in total control under the National Security Council, is doing.
[01:08:02.065 --> 01:08:05.946]  And now the CFR says we need global treaties for global.
[01:08:06.447 --> 01:08:07.867]  Let me give their exact quote here.
[01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:16.847]  For unilateral, that means complete, planetary scale geoengineering.
[01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:26.012]  And then you have the issue of them denying any of this is going on as the public says, what in the world is going on here?
[01:08:28.593 --> 01:08:31.875]  Fifteen years ago these trails disappeared, now they never leave.
[01:08:32.255 --> 01:08:33.556]  They turn into whole cloud banks.
[01:08:34.682 --> 01:08:43.284]  And then, speak to that specifically, how all the scientific data admits they're doing this, but then when we complain, they say, we don't know what you're talking about.
[01:08:44.485 --> 01:08:49.086]  Well, part of it is, let me go through three things here.
[01:08:49.606 --> 01:08:58.829]  First of all, the first time in Northern California that we saw contrails start to persist, looks like from the earliest photographs and records we have was around 1989.
[01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:08.988]  And from that time forward, beginning in the late 1980s, scientists began to talk about geoengineering.
[01:09:09.088 --> 01:09:18.972]  The word was kind of hidden from view, and it started to spring up at universities and special courses and things, but it wasn't talked about.
[01:09:19.453 --> 01:09:29.817]  But so many began to filter into a whole group of scientists who started to work on, as part of their curriculum at, in other words, Stanford University,
[01:09:30.345 --> 01:09:39.874]  And other areas, University of Irvine, and some government agencies began to work on these type of programs, this geoengineering type program.
[01:09:39.934 --> 01:09:40.635]  Let me stop you.
[01:09:41.376 --> 01:09:49.204]  It was, interviewing Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons, you know, confirmed, it was declassified, we interviewed him first, it was on Fox, CNN, you name it.
[01:09:49.744 --> 01:10:06.376]  It was Stanford Research Institute from 1960 to 67 that did the study with him, the meteorologist, and certified weather weapons, creation of hurricanes, typhoons, floods, things like that, and that they had certified they could control the weather by 1967.
[01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:12.621]  And you just mentioned this stuff started, as far as we can tell, as in California with Stanford.
[01:10:14.062 --> 01:10:15.523]  It could be.
[01:10:16.464 --> 01:10:18.165]  But what's happened since that time?
[01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:24.051]  We've been engaged since the 40s in hurricane modification, weather modification, lots of programs.
[01:10:24.191 --> 01:10:24.491]  Yes.
[01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:26.272]  That most of the public is unaware.
[01:10:26.852 --> 01:10:29.653]  And we were modifying the weather in Vietnam.
[01:10:30.633 --> 01:10:34.315]  So that brought us the Anmod Treaty, which was signed by the U.S.
[01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:37.976]  Congress to stop weather modification for warfare purposes.
[01:10:38.556 --> 01:10:46.919]  But now the military is talking about using it as a force multiplier in order to, in other words, control anyone they want.
[01:10:47.546 --> 01:10:49.807]  By controlling the weather that they have.
[01:10:50.548 --> 01:11:01.173]  So, this is on the scale of many, many documents from the Air Force and the other services talking about weather modification as a force multiplier.
[01:11:01.774 --> 01:11:13.020]  And then you add to this, in 2006, November, there was all of these scientists, geoengineering scientists from all over the world, went to NASA Ames.
[01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:17.944]  For one week of meetings with regard to geoengineering programs.
[01:11:18.884 --> 01:11:25.786]  And Ken Caldera, Professor Ken Caldera of Stanford University, said, well, we'll have an open public forum.
[01:11:25.826 --> 01:11:27.647]  We'll invite the press to come.
[01:11:28.467 --> 01:11:31.808]  And as luck would have it, I knew someone who was allowed to go to this.
[01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.309]  And so I went.
[01:11:33.829 --> 01:11:38.390]  And all of these professors, Gregory Benford from UC Irvine,
[01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:39.995]  Ken called the era.
[01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:44.818]  In other words, a great number of them were all there and were speaking.
[01:11:44.918 --> 01:11:47.279]  And that meeting became highly fascinating.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:48.860]  Stay there.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.121]  Let's hear about this meeting when we get back.
[01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.903]  And now, they're announcing it all over the news.
[01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.344]  Oh, we're going to control the weather.
[01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:57.946]  We're going to spray the skies with sunscreen to protect you.
[01:11:57.986 --> 01:12:02.068]  And that's what they're doing, the particuli, the nuclei, to create these clouds.
[01:12:02.108 --> 01:12:03.309]  But that's only one part of it.
[01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.771]  And the chemicals they're using are toxic.
[01:12:06.411 --> 01:12:07.292]  Spring is here.
[01:12:07.552 --> 01:12:08.332]  Growing season.
[01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:10.494]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:12.115]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:13.075]  Think about it.
[01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:17.238]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:20.960]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.861]  The country is running out of food.
[01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.683]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:12:25.963 --> 01:12:32.867]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs,
[01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:33.367]  I'm good.
[01:12:51.966 --> 01:12:52.786]  And the best part?
[01:12:53.087 --> 01:12:55.127]  All orders ship within 24 hours.
[01:12:55.427 --> 01:12:58.089]  So head over to OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:12:58.289 --> 01:13:02.610]  That's O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A-S-E-E-D dot com.
[01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.051]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[01:13:05.071 --> 01:13:11.614]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:12.413 --> 01:13:17.756]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:18.297 --> 01:13:24.480]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:26.602]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:26.762 --> 01:13:29.143]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:29.223 --> 01:13:40.110]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:42.401 --> 01:13:43.682]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:44.062 --> 01:13:45.462]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:52.285]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:52.845 --> 01:14:00.628]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:02.248]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:02.668 --> 01:14:03.849]  The people strike back.
[01:14:06.081 --> 01:14:08.783]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:14:09.163 --> 01:14:15.727]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:20.470]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:30.557]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:40.722]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years, compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:14:41.063 --> 01:14:44.687]  Call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237, extension 115, to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.874]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:54.656]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[01:14:55.137 --> 01:15:03.923]  Call Duane Daly with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[01:15:05.605 --> 01:15:06.785]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:13.390]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food, but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:15.572]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[01:15:19.497 --> 01:15:19.997]  We're good to go.
[01:15:51.155 --> 01:15:51.355]  We're good.
[01:16:15.394 --> 01:16:17.034]  This is all psychology.
[01:16:17.795 --> 01:16:30.018]  If they would have come out in the late 80s, 90s when they started this and said, we're going to terraform the planet and change the atmosphere, we're government, we're God, people would have sued environmentalists, what are you doing?
[01:16:30.298 --> 01:16:36.980]  If they use weather weapons as weapons against our farmers or other countries as economic control, people would know to blame them.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:46.625]  So that's why the government says there's no weather modification, none of this exists, as hundreds of universities, thousands worldwide work on it, and fleets of aircraft are spraying.
[01:16:47.446 --> 01:16:50.888]  And so now, after decades of us fighting it and saying, what's going on?
[01:16:50.908 --> 01:16:54.330]  You know, we're talking 14, 15 years that I've known of people speaking about this.
[01:16:55.911 --> 01:17:00.996]  It has that kook connotation, so even when the government announces it, people go, oh, no.
[01:17:01.837 --> 01:17:02.878]  Couldn't be happening.
[01:17:03.478 --> 01:17:10.425]  Just like their documents said 20 years ago, world government, global carbon tax, they said we were kooks, didn't exist.
[01:17:10.505 --> 01:17:14.970]  Now when they announce it, as they've done the last month, people go, oh, well it still doesn't exist.
[01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:17.911]  And newspapers attack me saying it doesn't exist.
[01:17:18.251 --> 01:17:19.872]  So that's the amazing psychology.
[01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:29.957]  And talking about amazing, Rosalind Peterson is probably the top overall, you know, person who is studying all the basic data and really integrating it in together.
[01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:36.020]  Rosalind, please continue with, well, the psychology of them denying all this and then the meetings you've gone to.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:36.400]  Go ahead.
[01:17:37.301 --> 01:17:41.443]  Well, this meeting at Stanford University in November 2006,
[01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:53.522]  They had a public section, and the public section of this meeting had different scientists, geoengineers, talking about their various programs that they wanted to implement.
[01:17:54.262 --> 01:18:06.854]  And what was fascinating about this group is they admitted right there that they had kind of hidden the word geoengineering for the public for a long time, because they realized that if it came out, the public would object.
[01:18:07.543 --> 01:18:25.230]  So, there was kind of this cloistered group that decided that they were going to work on this, have the funding for this, and then try to get it all set to go so that at some point they could implement putting these chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere to do these atmospheric experiments.
[01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:25.850]  Stop!
[01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:26.270]  Stop!
[01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:26.610]  Stop!
[01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.910]  Stop!
[01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:27.170]  Stop!
[01:18:27.191 --> 01:18:27.411]  Stop!
[01:18:27.451 --> 01:18:34.773]  You go to this conference and there's copies of the minutes and things on the web that I've seen and we need to dig them out and get them posted and you've linked them on your site.
[01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:35.674]  Think of the magnitude!
[01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:43.418]  You've got all these top climate scientists there, and by the way, these were the mid-levels being co-opted.
[01:18:43.639 --> 01:18:51.784]  Oh, we just came up with a plan to secretly terraform, but you can't let the public know they're not ready, even though this is a semi-public meeting.
[01:18:52.164 --> 01:18:57.608]  That's how the co-opt works when it's already been going on for over a decade before this.
[01:18:57.748 --> 01:19:01.390]  That is what is so key about this, and this mindset of
[01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.733]  We can't let them know because they're too small-minded.
[01:19:04.793 --> 01:19:06.534]  Specifically, that is so important.
[01:19:06.574 --> 01:19:07.235]  Go back over that.
[01:19:08.015 --> 01:19:15.641]  Okay, well, what they did is they said the public would object because, in other words, they can't control the end result of their experiment.
[01:19:16.202 --> 01:19:19.004]  They know that they would be putting harmful chemicals in the air.
[01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:24.308]  They know that, you know, like sulfur, for example, or, in other words, salt particles.
[01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:28.532]  There's all kinds of things that they've got planned that they could use in the air.
[01:19:29.096 --> 01:19:34.999]  That would be toxic to us or to plants or crops, whatever, water supplies.
[01:19:35.519 --> 01:19:55.508]  So what happened is they decided that they were going to be the stewards of the environment and it was going to be them that was going to save the world and that we were essentially the unwashed, as Professor Benford mentioned, it was kind of like we were the people were the unwashed masses who didn't understand that they were going to take care of us.
[01:19:56.345 --> 01:20:02.771]  So it was kind of an odd, um, I have some quotes from him which are quite interesting, but it was an odd meeting.
[01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:05.453]  So when I, they had question and answers.
[01:20:05.493 --> 01:20:09.356]  So when I got up and I spoke and I said, well, what about agriculture?
[01:20:09.517 --> 01:20:15.762]  If you cover us over and you stop direct sunlight from reaching the earth, there won't be any photosynthesis happening.
[01:20:16.423 --> 01:20:22.368]  And that's, um, in other words, photosynthesis, direct sunlight hitting the earth is what allows plants to grow.
[01:20:23.249 --> 01:20:25.130]  And food crops to produce.
[01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:40.919]  And if you remove the direct sunlight, whether it's from man-made clouds or any of these experiments, you're going to have lowered crop production because photosynthesis, the plants get their strength and energy to grow from that process.
[01:20:41.699 --> 01:20:44.120]  So, we get vitamin D from the sun.
[01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:49.243]  Ricketts is on the increase because we're in man-made cloud cover a lot of times.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:57.263]  So when I raised this issue about, well, was anybody talking about, in other words, the pollutants and what effect they were going to have on the trees?
[01:20:57.723 --> 01:21:00.724]  Was anyone talking about our food supply?
[01:21:01.184 --> 01:21:09.348]  And if you put up all these chemicals that are toxic to plant life, you reduce the amount of sunlight hitting the earth, what's going to happen to agriculture?
[01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.068]  You know, in other words, this area.
[01:21:11.609 --> 01:21:13.990]  And I said, and did anyone speak on this subject?
[01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:15.050]  And they said, well,
[01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:22.587]  There were actually only two people in the whole conference that spoke on something to do with, in other words, plant life, but that was it.
[01:21:23.247 --> 01:21:31.092]  But they said the majority of the speakers were all there into doing this atmospheric geoengineering and various forms of it.
[01:21:33.533 --> 01:21:36.215]  And they didn't really invite the public.
[01:21:36.275 --> 01:21:41.778]  Ken Calviera invited a radio talk show host from New York.
[01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:44.940]  He invited the BBC and Al Jazeera to this meeting.
[01:21:45.782 --> 01:21:50.506]  So when they met at Stanford, they didn't even invite the major press to come to this meeting at all.
[01:21:50.666 --> 01:21:51.326]  All right, stay there.
[01:21:51.346 --> 01:21:52.727]  I want to know if there's any recordings of this.
[01:21:53.088 --> 01:21:53.728]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:53.748 --> 01:21:55.169]  I want to go through some of those quotes, too.
[01:21:55.249 --> 01:21:55.589]  Riveting.
[01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.990]  We're on the march.
[01:21:57.491 --> 01:21:59.072]  The empire's on the run.
[01:22:00.033 --> 01:22:02.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:07.028 --> 01:22:12.250]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:14.250]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[01:22:15.571 --> 01:22:21.133]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[01:22:21.773 --> 01:22:25.194]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[01:22:25.434 --> 01:22:26.535]  We have been warned.
[01:22:26.735 --> 01:22:32.857]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:36.891]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:37.251]  Why?
[01:22:37.371 --> 01:22:41.173]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[01:22:41.353 --> 01:22:42.754]  Supplies are running low.
[01:22:42.914 --> 01:22:49.257]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:53.079]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[01:22:53.319 --> 01:22:55.600]  Go to yourfoodstorage.com.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.501]  That's yourfoodstorage.com.
[01:22:57.581 --> 01:22:58.322]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.

[01:23:05.287 --> 01:23:11.653]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:19.140]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:19.719 --> 01:23:25.905]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:26.305 --> 01:23:28.127]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:28.287 --> 01:23:30.689]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:30.789 --> 01:23:41.719]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.641]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:44.042 --> 01:23:45.403]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:52.201]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:52.781 --> 01:24:00.563]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:01.043 --> 01:24:02.183]  The Obama Deception.
[01:24:02.624 --> 01:24:03.804]  The people strike back.
[01:24:05.797 --> 01:24:10.079]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:24:10.319 --> 01:24:15.220]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.741]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:24:16.921 --> 01:24:20.402]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:25.704]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:24:25.944 --> 01:24:31.706]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:24:32.046 --> 01:24:34.468]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:36.889]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:24:37.089 --> 01:24:39.230]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:40.511]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:24:40.711 --> 01:24:41.652]  No animal testing.
[01:24:41.912 --> 01:24:43.213]  I use them and love them.
[01:24:43.233 --> 01:24:44.854]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:24:45.134 --> 01:24:46.214]  And I say big time.
[01:24:46.534 --> 01:24:47.755]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:24:47.795 --> 01:24:48.015]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:24:48.035 --> 01:24:49.696]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:24:58.021 --> 01:25:00.705]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:25:17.034 --> 01:25:26.642]  Rosalynn Peterson, she really is the preeminent chemtrail expert because she has just gone to the conferences, done the research, and she covers what is admitted, what is documented, what is on record.
[01:25:27.262 --> 01:25:28.123]  And it is hellish.
[01:25:28.683 --> 01:25:30.044]  Now I understand their operation.
[01:25:30.085 --> 01:25:32.386]  Everything is eugenics, like in-game documents.
[01:25:32.887 --> 01:25:33.787]  That's their system.
[01:25:34.548 --> 01:25:41.472]  And so the meeting she was at was a co-opting of, oh, we keep this secret and the low down for your own good.
[01:25:42.173 --> 01:25:49.017]  We're going to save the earth for the global warming when the evidence shows it will actually cause warming, which we may actually need.
[01:25:49.037 --> 01:25:52.039]  Kind of going towards an ice age now, the sunspots show.
[01:25:52.059 --> 01:25:57.602]  But side issue, the point is they don't want the public knowing about this.
[01:25:58.823 --> 01:26:01.685]  And it is just so incredible.
[01:26:02.932 --> 01:26:14.842]  to understand that it's really public what they're doing and so saying it's to stop global warming is the cover because this is bad for plants, bad for humans, bad for the earth.
[01:26:14.882 --> 01:26:23.049]  The sun is the main source of life on this planet and you've got some of the quotes of these people and their meetings are sourced and quoted.
[01:26:23.089 --> 01:26:24.731]  In fact, I have the meeting you're talking about.
[01:26:25.051 --> 01:26:27.393]  The Council on Foreign Relations mentions it.
[01:26:28.034 --> 01:26:30.496]  So can you speak more about the meeting and then more about
[01:26:30.976 --> 01:26:40.119]  I know you're going off what you know they're doing, but clearly they're spraying now, and how many different programs there are from your research, or the other experts, and what it is they're putting out.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.080]  Go ahead.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:47.122]  Well, there's a number of programs that I think are all interrelated.
[01:26:48.603 --> 01:27:00.107]  We have communication systems programs for the military, we have weapons systems that they're going to need to be able to use, in other words, the atmosphere above us, either obscure the skies,
[01:27:00.934 --> 01:27:05.216]  Or to, in other words, or to be able to use certain types of lasers.
[01:27:06.056 --> 01:27:08.457]  And so they're going to put up certain chemicals to do this.
[01:27:08.838 --> 01:27:10.138]  And the documents are there.
[01:27:10.919 --> 01:27:13.240]  And it's putting it forward to the public.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:21.443]  But more and more, we're beginning to unravel all these different types of atmospheric military programs that are going on.
[01:27:22.144 --> 01:27:25.045]  And weather modification is just one of them.
[01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:25.987]  That's
[01:27:41.032 --> 01:27:45.716]  mitigation and modification in it, in other words, to help with climate change.
[01:27:45.776 --> 01:27:51.120]  No, Obama's now said that, so now we'll pay Al Gore and Obama's private companies.
[01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:56.564]  Gore and Blood is the one in England, with Mr. Blood and Mr. Gore, literally.
[01:27:56.584 --> 01:27:57.925]  That's not a pun, folks.
[01:27:57.945 --> 01:28:00.587]  And the one up in Chicago, the mercantile that Obama's bought in on.
[01:28:00.807 --> 01:28:01.928]  Yeah, no, that's what they're saying.
[01:28:02.148 --> 01:28:06.471]  We're gonna now publicly pay tax money to Al Gore to chemtrail us.
[01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:07.652]  You gotta love that.
[01:28:09.332 --> 01:28:12.856]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see how this all works out.
[01:28:13.276 --> 01:28:25.189]  I can tell you that there is an audio tape of the meeting and I can get you a copy of the audio tape of that meeting because they allowed an audio tape to be made of the meeting.
[01:28:25.689 --> 01:28:26.290]  No film.
[01:28:26.963 --> 01:28:31.805]  But one audio tape, and so I can get you a tape of the meeting, and you can listen to these guys talk.
[01:28:32.305 --> 01:28:33.005]  Unbelievable!
[01:28:33.045 --> 01:28:34.306]  This isn't out on the web yet?
[01:28:34.346 --> 01:28:35.746]  I mean, is it okay if I get it?
[01:28:35.766 --> 01:28:38.227]  Because I don't want to wait making my chemtrail film.
[01:28:38.247 --> 01:28:38.807]  I don't do that.
[01:28:38.847 --> 01:28:40.448]  I would immediately just put it on YouTube.
[01:28:41.768 --> 01:28:42.808]  Yes, yes.
[01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:46.530]  I have children, just like everybody else.
[01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:47.930]  I don't want them breathing chemtrails anymore.
[01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:49.351]  I just want to get it out.
[01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.772]  The tape is on newyorkskywatch.com, I think.
[01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:54.336]  I think
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.480]  How did you wake up to this?
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.561]  How did you get involved?
[01:29:17.621 --> 01:29:19.602]  And it's just so amazing what you're doing.
[01:29:19.622 --> 01:29:21.263]  And how do folks support you?
[01:29:22.003 --> 01:29:25.225]  And how do they go to the site at CaliforniaSkyWatch.com and donate?
[01:29:25.265 --> 01:29:25.765]  Or what do they do?
[01:29:26.646 --> 01:29:37.911]  Well, what's happening right now is that I started in 2002 when a friend of mine, I was working for the Mendocino County Probation Department at the time.
[01:29:38.492 --> 01:29:42.974]  And during my lunch hour, he caught me downtown and took me into his office and said,
[01:29:43.772 --> 01:29:55.056]  That he knew that there was some programs going on, and he wanted me to look up in the sky, and he wanted me to really look on certain days, and to see these jets leaving these big plumes.
[01:29:55.796 --> 01:30:12.221]  So, what happened is, that particular day at lunch hour, when we walked outside, the jets were just blitzing the place, with all these, um, there was a great number of jets, and they were all leaving these huge contrails, which just expanded and turned into these massive plumes,
[01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:13.792]  This is such a massive story.
[01:30:33.266 --> 01:30:53.914]  What did you think when, I mean, I know last year the CFR announced we're going to terraform the planet, we're going to spray you, it's great, we're going to save you, when the scientists say it'll heat things, but whatever, and we know that's just a cover, so the scientists go, oh, we're saving Earth, okay, keep it secret, from the unwash, you're using these arrogant eugenicist terms, is what it's all about, to now having
[01:30:54.574 --> 01:31:05.801]  You know, all these mainstream news articles and BBC saying, oh, we're doing this for your own good, and then now having the President's Chief Scientist Advisor saying, we may have to start doing this for your safety.
[01:31:05.821 --> 01:31:08.743]  I mean, what is it like to see them just coming right out with it?
[01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:10.264]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[01:31:11.324 --> 01:31:21.811]  Because they've been doing it for a long time, and we're getting closer and closer to figuring out all the programs, and that they're dying to use it and do the experiments because they want the money.
[01:31:22.338 --> 01:31:26.983]  They see that they're going to get federal funds for it for the first time and they can expand the program.
[01:31:27.664 --> 01:31:29.325]  And so why not try it out?
[01:31:29.426 --> 01:31:32.529]  Why not do the experiments we've been studying and researching?
[01:31:32.549 --> 01:31:34.151]  And this is the payback for us.
[01:31:34.911 --> 01:31:40.958]  So a lot of these universities and researchers and geoengineers are going to come and get fully funded.
[01:31:41.553 --> 01:31:45.476]  For a lot of these programs that have been sitting in the wings for years.
[01:31:45.797 --> 01:31:50.200]  So as bad as chemtrailing is, they want it even bigger.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.501]  That's what the CFR says.
[01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:53.563]  They say they want it globally, everywhere.
[01:31:54.143 --> 01:31:57.046]  Speak to that and right now where we know it's going on the worst.
[01:31:58.387 --> 01:32:03.091]  Well, I really think that everybody says that their own area is the worst.
[01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:05.933]  But I think the NATO countries are being hit the hardest.
[01:32:06.614 --> 01:32:10.557]  And I think that the United States and Canada is being really hit hard.
[01:32:11.412 --> 01:32:15.095]  They're hitting Brazil pretty hard in various places.
[01:32:16.396 --> 01:32:22.981]  But around the world, it's pretty global around the world that you very rarely can see any pictures now with blue skies.
[01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:24.903]  Most of them are man-made clouds.
[01:32:26.204 --> 01:32:36.572]  Professor Rosenfeld from Australia is talking about it at a meeting here of the Climate Change Commission, EPA, in
[01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:41.673]  Sacramento, California, he talked about that most of the clouds we see are man-made clouds.
[01:32:42.434 --> 01:32:47.518]  And I was early on in my research and I had to rather pause and go, what?
[01:32:48.298 --> 01:32:57.225]  And now when you go to the NASA website, you type in man-made clouds, you've got all kinds of studies, all kinds of research, and they talk about man-made clouds.
[01:32:57.725 --> 01:33:01.188]  But the problem is that agriculture, human health,
[01:33:01.986 --> 01:33:05.727]  Plant growth, tree health, everything depends on direct sunlight.
[01:33:06.127 --> 01:33:06.848]  Let me stop you.
[01:33:06.868 --> 01:33:16.931]  I'm going to keep interrupting because we had a big garden out at our ancestral family farm, and we've never seen a summer where plants wouldn't grow, and not this summer or the summer before.
[01:33:17.351 --> 01:33:20.092]  It was chemtrails five, six days out of the week.
[01:33:20.212 --> 01:33:23.273]  Even here, my yard in the summer was dying.
[01:33:23.653 --> 01:33:25.074]  It was raining and mush.
[01:33:25.794 --> 01:33:28.755]  And the yard, basically, about half of it died.
[01:33:29.095 --> 01:33:31.075]  Trees were all dying and acting weird.
[01:33:31.315 --> 01:33:37.856]  And it was just pure chemtrails the entire summer, all over Central Texas and East Texas, where I was at.
[01:33:37.876 --> 01:33:38.756]  I wasn't in other parts.
[01:33:39.316 --> 01:33:43.677]  And my uncle's garden, just, nothing even grew.
[01:33:43.697 --> 01:33:44.897]  That's correct.
[01:33:44.977 --> 01:33:46.718]  And it was just solid chemtrails.
[01:33:46.758 --> 01:33:47.458]  Just solid.
[01:33:47.478 --> 01:33:48.478]  There was no sky.
[01:33:49.018 --> 01:33:49.838]  Right.
[01:33:50.398 --> 01:33:55.039]  And when there's no, when you have all these man-made clouds and these plumes,
[01:33:56.823 --> 01:34:11.386]  You're not getting direct sunlight, which means that your trees won't grow properly, your crops won't produce well, your oceans don't function well either, because they need direct sunlight in order for all the processes here on Earth to work.
[01:34:12.007 --> 01:34:23.469]  And these scientists are beginning to say, well, we can put up, you know, we can pretend like we're a volcano, like the one that just went off in Alaska, and we can put up these particulates and we can cool us down.
[01:34:25.193 --> 01:34:30.495]  See, but backwards, all the scientists agree, volcanoes cause heating.
[01:34:32.556 --> 01:34:34.497]  Well, they cause a degree of cooling.
[01:34:34.798 --> 01:34:36.879]  Well, cooling at first, but then heating, but go ahead.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:43.102]  My whole issue is they put out more carbon dioxide than they say heats the earth.
[01:34:43.642 --> 01:34:50.906]  And I know when Krakatoa went off it went down a degree, but then they've got these calculations then saying it makes CO2 go up and then later makes it go up.
[01:34:51.146 --> 01:34:52.667]  I'm saying from what they claim, but go ahead.
[01:34:53.493 --> 01:35:11.257]  But what happens with this is that if you start to put these particulates up in these, you know, they're even talking about fields and they're talking about all kinds of different, you know, oh gosh, they must have 40 or 50 different solutions to all of this that they all want to do at the same time.
[01:35:11.838 --> 01:35:14.078]  So you won't even know what the synergistic effects are.
[01:35:14.478 --> 01:35:21.080]  But the problem is that we've got a case of where we're already getting a loss of direct sunlight called global dimming already.
[01:35:21.937 --> 01:35:29.121]  And when we say, well, global dimming is going on, and we're putting up more cloud cover, but still we're warming.
[01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:37.605]  Well, we're warming because this cloud cover, and all of these artificial things that are being done, are heating us up and exacerbating the global warming.
[01:35:38.125 --> 01:35:50.611]  So we have to stop some of these man-made things, and the Earth would come back to more normal, and we could reduce the pollutants by taxing the polluters, like the EPA does now.
[01:35:51.252 --> 01:36:07.461]  Instead of thinking that we're going to have these offsets and polluters can buy offsets in order to pollute more, you see this cap-and-trade and this carbon tax and all these things that they're deciding isn't going to reduce pollution one iota.
[01:36:07.481 --> 01:36:10.823]  Okay, specifically though, specifically, I want to go back.
[01:36:10.863 --> 01:36:12.884]  From your side of the research and talking to scientists,
[01:36:14.509 --> 01:36:22.491]  Haven't they been reporting though that the chemtrailing overall causes the radiation to go through the clouds and then bounce back up and keep the heat in?
[01:36:22.771 --> 01:36:25.071]  So that part of the project is heating?
[01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:27.431]  That part of the project is heating.
[01:36:27.492 --> 01:36:29.612]  So what they're already doing is they're heating.
[01:36:30.152 --> 01:36:41.194]  But see, I think that there might be another, you know, this is speculation on my part, and I'll jump here into real speculation, is that I know that in the Arctic and in Alaska,
[01:36:41.678 --> 01:37:04.991]  I know that the oil companies and the military want to get into those areas and open up those areas for exploration and military programs, and see what they're doing is they say, well, if we use water vapor and we heat it up up in Alaska and we get it to melt, then we can go in, like ExxonMobil's doing right now, and we can exploit the natural resources in those frozen areas.
[01:37:05.591 --> 01:37:07.052]  So I'm not quite sure
[01:37:09.266 --> 01:37:23.472]  If we're not doing something deliberate here to warm up certain areas, and then the geoengineers like it because then they can call this a great problem that we're having and we're going to solve global warming.
[01:37:24.304 --> 01:37:30.568]  But I think that they're exacerbating it, and I think that the jets and these big plumes, all of this stuff is heating us up.
[01:37:30.908 --> 01:37:33.489]  Okay, let me throw another question at you, because you're such an expert.
[01:37:33.529 --> 01:37:35.430]  I've got so many, I apologize, I keep interrupting.
[01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:48.537]  Have you heard about Anne Heche and this big Australian movie about the government with chemtrails spraying viruses on people, and then now it aired on Australian TV and then they suddenly pulled it off IMDb?
[01:37:48.578 --> 01:37:49.198]  Have you heard of this?
[01:37:49.938 --> 01:37:52.820]  I've heard that it was pulled and not available right now.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.621]  But I mean, it was on TV and then suddenly pulled.
[01:37:57.081 --> 01:37:58.201]  How bizarre is that?
[01:37:58.781 --> 01:38:03.422]  Let's play the trailer for that for folks right now watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and listening on the radio.
[01:38:03.442 --> 01:38:03.842]  Here it is.
[01:38:07.383 --> 01:38:08.384]  It's loading slowly here.
[01:38:08.404 --> 01:38:11.004]  Can you guys give me some audio?
[01:38:12.565 --> 01:38:18.606]  Hours ago we learned of a deadly virus that threatens the lives of the citizens of Spokane.
[01:38:18.786 --> 01:38:20.967]  Tess, thanks for getting here so fast.
[01:38:22.284 --> 01:38:23.205]  This is Dr. Martin.
[01:38:23.285 --> 01:38:25.568]  She's a specialist with the Global Health Organization.
[01:38:25.748 --> 01:38:30.755]  We have three new cases, all presenting the same acute flu-like symptoms, but they're not responding to any of the treatment.
[01:38:32.645 --> 01:38:34.267]  She's gonna be dead by the time I get the results back.
[01:38:34.747 --> 01:38:37.049]  You must have some initial thoughts of what it could be.
[01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:38.070]  It could be anything.
[01:38:38.511 --> 01:38:40.353]  From the avian flu to the bubonic plague.
[01:38:40.513 --> 01:38:43.616]  We're not gonna quarantine a whole town until we know what we're dealing with.
[01:38:43.816 --> 01:38:47.360]  Find the source, make the diagnosis, and you'll have your quarantine.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.541]  We're counting on you.
[01:38:48.721 --> 01:38:52.345]  The quicker you tell me what you know, the faster I can help all these people.
[01:38:52.605 --> 01:38:54.686]  Professor Dylan Corbin.
[01:38:55.027 --> 01:38:58.649]  I saw him after he came back from a trip and he wasn't well.
[01:38:58.909 --> 01:39:00.330]  They say he's been dead two, three days.
[01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:02.031]  He had a mosquito bite on him.
[01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:03.612]  And he's been to Malaysia, Roche.
[01:39:03.832 --> 01:39:04.533]  That's the plague.
[01:39:04.553 --> 01:39:09.196]  Professor Corbin bring back more than just his luggage from Malaysia?
[01:39:09.236 --> 01:39:10.357]  Are you following me?
[01:39:10.397 --> 01:39:12.098]  There's more going on here than you know, Dr. Brannon.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.762]  To putting something in the jet fuel.
[01:39:15.882 --> 01:39:16.803]  It's making people sick.
[01:39:17.043 --> 01:39:17.984]  Why would they want to do that?
[01:39:18.224 --> 01:39:20.647]  Keller makes a chemical called E-901.
[01:39:20.867 --> 01:39:23.190]  When we get the E-901, we can pair it with the jet fuel.
[01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:26.213]  Maybe you can help us figure out what's hurting people.
[01:39:26.333 --> 01:39:28.316]  Whatever he told you is totally erroneous.
[01:39:28.656 --> 01:39:30.158]  The patients are not responding to the antibiotics.
[01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:32.705]  All of the immune systems are completely shot.
[01:39:33.045 --> 01:39:34.286]  But the plague doesn't do that.
[01:39:34.426 --> 01:39:37.088]  No, I know, but I think it's why they're not responding to the antibiotics.
[01:39:37.209 --> 01:39:38.430]  So what, do we misdiagnose them?
[01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.590]  No.
[01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:40.631]  Have you ever heard of chemtrails?
[01:39:40.772 --> 01:39:43.834]  What if the chemicals are affecting the general population somehow?
[01:39:43.994 --> 01:39:45.656]  They've killed before and they'll kill again.
[01:39:45.676 --> 01:39:50.580]  This virus could have been spread all over the country by now.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.381]  He knows he's bleeding.
[01:39:52.401 --> 01:39:55.244]  They're all gonna die if I can't find a cure.
[01:39:55.744 --> 01:39:56.425]  I'm gonna die.
[01:39:57.105 --> 01:39:57.926]  Don't give up on me.
[01:39:59.091 --> 01:40:00.114]  Tell us where the vaccine is.
[01:40:00.575 --> 01:40:01.276]  You can go to hell.
[01:40:01.437 --> 01:40:03.983]  You don't have to worry about the vaccine.
[01:40:04.223 --> 01:40:06.428]  You're both gonna die before anyone gets a chance to use it.
[01:40:09.747 --> 01:40:12.049]  And now they've pulled it off IMDB.
[01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:14.150]  They never put a film up and then pull it down.
[01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:16.372]  I mean, folks, here's the deal.
[01:40:16.772 --> 01:40:19.113]  We have confirmed they're building mass graves all over the country.
[01:40:19.153 --> 01:40:22.696]  We have the Rocky Mountain News where they have built incinerators and mass graves.
[01:40:23.136 --> 01:40:24.617]  The executive order in Colorado.
[01:40:24.657 --> 01:40:30.301]  We have the feds going to the states, confirmed in triplicate with the documents they're building mass graves for the bird flu.
[01:40:31.762 --> 01:40:38.266]  London Telegraph admits they caught the government telling people it was an irregular flu shot and killing them in Europe with a live bird flu.
[01:40:39.227 --> 01:40:40.767]  My God, these people are psychopathic.
[01:40:40.907 --> 01:40:43.388]  And they always love to throw it in our faces in a movie.
[01:40:43.668 --> 01:40:46.209]  Or maybe Anne Heche was trying to warn people and that's why they pulled it.
[01:40:46.529 --> 01:40:48.449]  This is getting a little crazy, isn't it?
[01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:53.850]  Well, we're beginning to be railroaded into scare tactics.
[01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:58.251]  Into taking actions that we wouldn't take under normal circumstances.
[01:40:58.291 --> 01:41:00.832]  We would think about it and we would have public discussions.
[01:41:01.474 --> 01:41:09.078]  And right now, we're more and more being told what they're going to do, but the public is not becoming part of the conversation.
[01:41:09.758 --> 01:41:21.444]  And so it's easier to jack up, in other words, some conspiracy theory, and say, well, the public that objects, they don't understand, they're ignorant, or they don't know what they're talking about.
[01:41:21.883 --> 01:41:29.786]  And thus, we, the elite, will tell you what we are going to do and how we are going to save you or not.
[01:41:30.186 --> 01:41:32.227]  Isn't that what it's all about, is playing God?
[01:41:32.287 --> 01:41:34.267]  These people, like you said, we're the unwashed masses.
[01:41:34.708 --> 01:41:35.588]  Yeah.
[01:41:35.728 --> 01:41:36.648]  It's playing God.
[01:41:36.688 --> 01:41:42.030]  And I thought that these geoengineers at Stanford University were really playing God.
[01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:43.371]  I really believe that.
[01:41:44.491 --> 01:41:48.672]  Because I was shocked when I was listening to them and I said, well, what about plant life?
[01:41:48.712 --> 01:41:50.093]  What about photosynthesis?
[01:41:50.774 --> 01:41:54.316]  I was talking about, well, what about crop production?
[01:41:55.217 --> 01:42:00.580]  This was so far out of their realm because they didn't want to talk about it.
[01:42:01.561 --> 01:42:18.831]  And they actually brought up in the meeting, the one guy who didn't like my questions, he said to the audience, who was mostly professors and, in other words, people that were in that field, and he said, well, how many people believe in chemtrails?
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:34.175]  And I just sat there and I looked at him and I thought, and so then he went, he looked kind of funny because there wasn't any great show of hands for this, for this phenomena within this audience, because they just sat there.
[01:42:34.656 --> 01:42:37.459]  And he says, oh, well, that's some sort of conspiracy theory.
[01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:43.252]  And, but, but, the thing is, they got very angry with me in the press... Now stop there, I want to hear more about this.
[01:42:43.292 --> 01:42:47.353]  Notice, they're admitting they're going to geo-engineer things, block out the sun.
[01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:50.975]  You say, well, the plants need sun, which is admitted photosynthesis.
[01:42:51.395 --> 01:42:55.557]  No, no, no, no, that's a conspiracy theory that plants have photosynthesis.
[01:42:55.657 --> 01:42:58.938]  In fact, that plants exist will soon be a conspiracy theory.
[01:42:59.318 --> 01:43:01.939]  They'll all be dead in the media, I'll tell you, they never existed.
[01:43:02.459 --> 01:43:04.680]  Mommy, is it true there was once a thing called plants?
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.721]  No, honey, that's all kind of... Gardeners, you have the seeds.
[01:43:07.942 --> 01:43:10.223]  Now let us help you create the ultimate garden.
[01:43:10.423 --> 01:43:13.645]  And whether or not you've got good soil, we've got just the solution.
[01:43:13.925 --> 01:43:18.247]  Add Grand Liquid Organic Fertilizer at liquidorganicfertilizer.com.
[01:43:18.427 --> 01:43:21.629]  Restore life to your soil or apply directly to the crop.
[01:43:21.789 --> 01:43:24.090]  Visit liquidorganicfertilizer.com.
[01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:31.654]  Fuller feeding with our 4-3-3 or sulfate of potash with kelp is 20 times more efficient than applying amendments to the soil.
[01:43:31.934 --> 01:43:33.535]  Manhattan fish, blood meal,
[01:43:33.735 --> 01:43:34.456]  I think so.
[01:43:58.234 --> 01:44:01.619]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:12.515 --> 01:44:17.860]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:24.586]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:24.886 --> 01:44:26.727]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:26.867 --> 01:44:29.270]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:40.219]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:42.503 --> 01:44:43.764]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:44.185 --> 01:44:45.586]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:52.352]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:52.953 --> 01:45:00.740]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.361]  The Obama Deception.
[01:45:02.782 --> 01:45:03.983]  The people strike back.
[01:45:07.074 --> 01:45:08.274]  Recognize that sound?
[01:45:08.574 --> 01:45:13.116]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[01:45:13.356 --> 01:45:15.497]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:45:15.817 --> 01:45:20.898]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:45:21.138 --> 01:45:26.280]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:29.681]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[01:45:29.981 --> 01:45:32.101]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[01:45:32.422 --> 01:45:33.942]  Introducing Choose for Health.
[01:45:34.242 --> 01:45:39.667]  A delicious tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, sea vegetables, and antioxidants.
[01:45:40.027 --> 01:45:42.549]  Stop paying for nutrients your body doesn't use.
[01:45:42.849 --> 01:45:44.371]  Order Choose for Health today.
[01:45:44.391 --> 01:45:44.791]  1-800-210-1922.

[01:45:54.439 --> 01:45:57.661]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[01:45:57.681 --> 01:45:57.782]  1-800-210-1922.
[01:45:57.942 --> 01:45:58.822]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[01:46:25.029 --> 01:46:31.711]  Yeah, there is so much going on, folks, and regardless, they've denied they're messing with the atmosphere, and now they're just coming right out with it.
[01:46:33.011 --> 01:46:34.272]  The denial needs to stop.
[01:46:34.372 --> 01:46:37.392]  We need to get control of the shadow government, the national security state.
[01:46:37.432 --> 01:46:40.273]  It is just completely out of control, and it's run by eugenicists.
[01:46:40.773 --> 01:46:42.734]  I go to CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[01:46:43.714 --> 01:46:46.815]  Again, how do people support you and the wonderful work you're doing, Rosalind Peterson?
[01:46:48.115 --> 01:46:54.277]  Well, I always accept contributions, because it enables me to
[01:46:55.506 --> 01:46:56.426]  Do more research.
[01:46:56.487 --> 01:46:58.307]  It emails me to contact more people.
[01:46:59.527 --> 01:47:06.190]  So anyone can go to my CaliforniaSkyWatch.com and there's contact information.
[01:47:07.190 --> 01:47:18.213]  My email is there info at CaliforniaSkyWatch.com or people can call me directly at 707-485-7520.
[01:47:18.354 --> 01:47:22.655]  I try to answer all my emails and I try to talk with all the people that contact me.
[01:47:23.317 --> 01:47:51.777]  I'm always looking for research materials as well, where they can give me government documents, or in other words, any type of public document, government study, university study, on these subjects, because the more that we know and put all the pieces of the puzzle together, the sooner we're going to be able to step up and pin them with the actual facts, so that they can't just come back and do what the Air Force does, write letters for Senator Dianne Feinstein,
[01:47:52.655 --> 01:48:14.421]  uh... to her constituents saying that there's no such thing as as uh... chemtrails it's a hoax and therefore nothing is going on and everything is wonderful and normal and those of us who have been around when when the skies were deep blue most of the time and clouds were real know that this is just not true because things are not like they used to be at all.
[01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:19.303]  That's what I was about to say is that looking you know when you look at the uh...
[01:48:20.216 --> 01:48:23.457]  You know, different terms that you can Google to pull up University Studies.
[01:48:23.577 --> 01:48:24.498]  It's not chemtrails.
[01:48:24.578 --> 01:48:28.279]  It's what, you know, aerial aerosol spray.
[01:48:28.299 --> 01:48:29.700]  You know, different terms you can look at.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.081]  Weather modification.
[01:48:31.361 --> 01:48:31.981]  There they are.
[01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:33.021]  There they are doing it.
[01:48:33.502 --> 01:48:35.543]  This is bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[01:48:35.583 --> 01:48:39.904]  I mean, this sucker is massive and they're publicly about to make it bigger.
[01:48:40.565 --> 01:48:47.968]  Yes, and I think that they're going to say, well, you know, they're going to railroad us into saying, well, the world is warming and we need to fix it.
[01:48:48.618 --> 01:48:53.783]  But I don't see them doing anything about the jet airplanes leaving these contrails that are exacerbating it.
[01:48:54.424 --> 01:48:59.268]  And they don't talk about the aviation problems that this is causing.
[01:48:59.829 --> 01:49:08.998]  So when we say we want to do something about global warming, then no one is going to... How come no one steps up and says, well, look what we're doing?
[01:49:09.406 --> 01:49:14.028]  Why don't we reduce what we're doing, and this would change it almost immediately.
[01:49:14.249 --> 01:49:15.649]  Well, they want total domination.
[01:49:15.689 --> 01:49:19.691]  It's like in 97 when the Secretary of Defense said, we can now control the weather.
[01:49:20.192 --> 01:49:21.432]  He said that in a press briefing.
[01:49:21.972 --> 01:49:24.654]  And so that's on record, the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen.
[01:49:25.314 --> 01:49:36.040]  They're playing God, and just like they told us, there's no new world order, there's no royal government, there's no Bank of the World, we're not planning a global currency, and then, oh, we're setting up a North American Union and a global government!
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.061]  We just got the idea today!
[01:49:38.821 --> 01:49:43.126]  Uh, you know, they deny, deny, deny, deny, and then finally go, okay, it's a done deal, we've been doing it forever.
[01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:48.571]  And it's just Twilight Zone that it's this bizarre and this crazy.
[01:49:48.611 --> 01:49:50.913]  Well, you're just an amazing individual and I look forward to it.
[01:49:50.933 --> 01:49:51.134]  Thank you.
[01:49:51.474 --> 01:49:51.674]  You bet.
[01:49:51.694 --> 01:49:59.062]  In the next few weeks, I want to get you up for two hours, take calls, let you put on a full presentation, because it doesn't do justice having you on for 52 minutes here with the breaks.
[01:49:59.842 --> 01:50:02.324]  So again, CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[01:50:02.704 --> 01:50:04.686]  Rosalynn Peterson, we salute you.
[01:50:04.706 --> 01:50:07.147]  I want to say bye to you here at the end of the show and talk to you about some issues.
[01:50:07.528 --> 01:50:19.516]  I'm making a film on chemtrails after my next Obama film, so get ready for that, folks, and send us all your footage, materials, whatever you think should be in the film, because it's just amazing, and we've got to expose this now.
[01:50:19.576 --> 01:50:19.896]  It's now.
[01:50:20.277 --> 01:50:20.997]  Now is the time.
[01:50:21.017 --> 01:50:25.740]  Enough people know it's real to educate the rest of the public and have an action plan to turn this around.
[01:50:26.761 --> 01:50:31.424]  Also, don't forget the Obama deception showing this guy works for the same people Bush works for.
[01:50:31.624 --> 01:50:33.245]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:33.285 --> 01:50:41.150]  Rebroadcast starts now with a ton of important guests and information at InfoWars.com on the audio restreams and on AM and FM stations across the country.

[01:50:43.311 --> 01:50:43.631]  Central.
[01:50:43.671 --> 01:50:44.152]  God bless.
[01:50:47.253 --> 01:50:50.655]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:50.675 --> 01:50:52.477]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:55.779 --> 01:50:57.339]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:57.459 --> 01:51:02.061]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:51:02.201 --> 01:51:04.961]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:05.162 --> 01:51:08.022]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:08.202 --> 01:51:14.044]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:51:14.304 --> 01:51:17.226]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:17.526 --> 01:51:24.432]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:24.552 --> 01:51:27.654]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:27.794 --> 01:51:29.676]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:32.938 --> 01:51:34.039]  Thank you for listening to
[01:52:09.165 --> 01:52:11.866]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Greg Moore.
[01:52:12.306 --> 01:52:12.686]  A U.S.
[01:52:12.746 --> 01:52:17.448]  Navy destroyer is now on the scene of a ship hijacking off the east coast of Somalia.
[01:52:17.628 --> 01:52:22.629]  The USS Bainbridge arrived in the area where Somali pirates captured an American-flagged vessel.
[01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:28.011]  At last report, the captain was still being held hostage, but the crew was in control of the hijacked ship.
[01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:32.153]  President Obama has set up a new office dedicated to healthcare reform.
[01:52:32.453 --> 01:52:38.196]  Obama emphasized overhauling the healthcare industry is one of the biggest priorities for his first year of presidency.
[01:52:38.517 --> 01:52:40.558]  In the executive order, Obama said the U.S.
[01:52:40.578 --> 01:52:44.720]  healthcare system, quote, suffers from serious and pervasive problems.
[01:52:45.302 --> 01:52:48.786]  If you live in Missouri or North Carolina, the check isn't in the mail.
[01:52:48.866 --> 01:52:54.473]  Those states are among those who haven't sent their tax refunds because there's not enough money in their coffers.
[01:52:55.014 --> 01:53:01.481]  California just began releasing refunds last month following the state's over 100 day long budget stalemate.
[01:53:02.062 --> 01:53:04.205]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
