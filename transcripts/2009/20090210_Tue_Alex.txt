[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.141]  We are live.
[00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.323]  It is the 10th day of February, 2009.
[00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:21.786]  We've got two hours left in this transmission.
[00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:26.430]  Larry Pratt, the Director of Governors of America, is coming up in the next segment.
[00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:34.037]  In the news I have here today, the Senate has passed the quote, stimulus package.
[00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:37.119]  It's really a total federalization, an expansion of federalization.
[00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.801]  Just in the healthcare area alone, and they have the subsections here.
[00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:43.496]  I can't read this multi-thousand page bill.
[00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:44.297]  It's changing every day.
[00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:45.517]  This is the version they passed.
[00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:48.459]  Ruin your health with the Obama Stimulus Plan.
[00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.720]  Bloomberg Financial News.
[00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:56.084]  And it says if you're above the age of 55, you're going to have health care rationed.
[00:00:56.904 --> 00:00:59.126]  It takes over the health care doctors can give.
[00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.467]  It allows the government to set what health care you're allowed to get.
[00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.389]  And it admits that it is the British model.
[00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:12.703]  It is the British model of rationing health care, so I'm going to go back over this a little bit later in the show.
[00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:15.695]  We have the Newsweek cover story.
[00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.156]  We are all socialists now.
[00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:19.617]  And this is a lie.
[00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:36.826]  Socialism is always engineered by the big private central banks so that they can expand the size of government to take over the economy and then get everybody on the government dole where they control society and then they can play games with controlling education, controlling health care, controlling the society.
[00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:43.549]  This is a government-run system controlled and owned by private interests that then take the money offshore.
[00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:48.026]  Just amazing.
[00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.767]  So there is the Newsweek cover.
[00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:52.048]  Somebody needs to go out and buy that cover.
[00:01:52.068 --> 00:01:57.349]  We need to actually physically have that Newsweek cover for ourselves.
[00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.950]  So, we are all socialists now.
[00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.112]  I'm going to go over this story after Larry Pratt is on with us.
[00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:11.033]  Also, I want to get into a story Kurt Nimmo did yesterday.
[00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:14.573]  We first broke this Sunday on WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.334]  They are announcing what we've been warning you about for years.
[00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:32.237]  Administration after administration has been quietly setting this up to have tens of thousands of preachers, prominent ones in the heads of the major denominations and faiths, working for the government and preparing and selling the public on
[00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:43.280]  Well, they say gun control, open borders, quote, fighting, climate change, this is all in there.
[00:02:46.823 --> 00:02:57.533]  Continuing here on February 6th, the blog section of the White House website announced a recent executive order signed by Obama establishing the new White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
[00:02:57.593 --> 00:03:06.561]  Instead of driving us apart, our very beliefs can bring us together, Obama said February 5th during the National Prayer Breakfast, E Pluribus Unum, in other words, the blog declared.
[00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:11.746]  Whether it's concerning groups that are training people for new jobs or figuring out the role of faith-based organizations.
[00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.527]  That's another bill with the FEMA camps.
[00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:14.668]  Preachers will be running it.
[00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:21.554]  In combating global climate change, the office creates those partnerships in ways that's responsible, constitutional.
[00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:22.755]  This is not constitutional.
[00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:25.437]  To have the feds in control of your local churches and money.
[00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.219]  Separation Church and State.
[00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:37.729]  And bottom line, helps those in need, said Joshua Du Bois, a Pentecostal pastor, social activist, and former campaign religious outreach director, who was appointed to lead Obama's faith-based initiative.
[00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:43.594]  Now remember, the Democrats were all against Bush with tens of billions of dollars to buy off and control the churches.
[00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:44.895]  Then we found out what that was.
[00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:50.881]  Clergy response teams to go out and tell the public to go along with gun confiscations, going into the FEMA camps, forced inoculations.
[00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:51.642]  That's in the bill.
[00:03:52.322 --> 00:04:04.711]  Now, it's in the new bill, now this is just past regulations, but now it's in the new bill to build all the new FEMA camps, already built some, and have the faith-based organizations and local police all merged into that.
[00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:11.916]  So, we'll be getting into this report a little bit more as well after Larry Pratt leaves us after about 30 minutes getting into this.
[00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:23.527]  Massive group of the most hardcore gun control victim disarmament legislation ever seen in the history of the United States.
[00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:28.189]  So that is coming up as well after the break.
[00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:29.589]  And your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:29.669]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.949]  Stay with us.
[00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.596]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.731]  Here is why.

[00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:09.371]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.812]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:12.332]  this fall?
[00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:13.332]  Don't wait.

[00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:40.018]  A new world order.
[00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:40.718]  In the near future.
[00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.424]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:52.944 --> 00:05:55.086]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:57.969]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.992]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:09.060]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:17.065]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:21.008]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:23.870]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.111]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:25.891]  They're not after money.
[00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:26.992]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:27.192 --> 00:06:27.773]  They're after power.
[00:06:27.813 --> 00:06:29.033]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:38.400]  Endgame.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.601]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:41.902]  You have been warned.
[00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:45.004]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:46.485]  eFoods does it again.
[00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:51.489]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:59.956]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:08.122]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:11.305]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency,

[00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:22.708]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:25.230]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:29.813]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:32.875]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:35.236]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:50.826]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:54.469]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:02.214]  For those that don't know, hundreds of publications the last three months
[00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:11.195]  Newsweek, Time Magazine, The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times of London, The Times of London, The London Guardian.
[00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:28.725]  Hundreds have announced that there is a world government, that it's the only solution to the economic crisis, and that we will pay our taxes to a new global bank that will set world interest rates and set world currency prices in the nations controlled by the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:30.973]  They have built the FEMA camps.
[00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:33.574]  It's now mainstream news that they're for the American people.
[00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:36.814]  The 20,000 combat troops are training for gun confiscation.
[00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:40.335]  The Army War College admits their new mission is engaging the American people.
[00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:48.116]  Obama promised, and his Chief of Staff wrote a book about it and gave interviews saying, 18 to 24, you'll be forced to serve in a new domestic military.
[00:08:48.677 --> 00:08:55.518]  The Pentagon, without a law, just announced a new million-person domestic army they're going to form, forcing all young people to be part of it.
[00:08:56.482 --> 00:08:57.562]  Now that's in their documents.
[00:08:57.602 --> 00:09:03.785]  The public push for all of this is, oh, we're going to make you work at soup kitchens for the people.
[00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:04.865]  You're not against soup kitchens.
[00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:09.067]  And, oh, the Army's going to help at car wrecks on the side of the road and fight DWIs.
[00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:11.248]  You're not for drunk drivers, are you?
[00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:14.689]  So that's the public push, but in the documents it's all admitted.
[00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:26.775]  They have the most draconian victim disarmament known as gun control bills ever introduced to register all American gun owners to license psychological tests, federal testing.
[00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:36.158]  The Attorney General's announcing that he'll just try to ban any guns he wishes just by him signing orders, all semiannuals.
[00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:43.861]  They're announcing no fly list, that anybody that's on that, over a million people, won't be able to own a gun, no judge, no jury, just a black list.
[00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:48.245]  At state levels, they're going after people.
[00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:50.267]  The BATF's going after gun shop dealers.
[00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:52.068]  They're trying to stop importation.
[00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:56.852]  If you thought Bill Clinton was bad, this is nothing.
[00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:58.873]  Newsweek's announcing we're now socialist.
[00:09:59.434 --> 00:10:00.835]  They're taking over the churches.
[00:10:02.976 --> 00:10:05.498]  The stimulus plan is socialized health care.
[00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:08.160]  Telling doctors what procedures they can do, what they can't.
[00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.862]  If you're over 55, they're going to ration your health care.
[00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.504]  Word for word, I have the bill.
[00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:14.906]  It's in Bloomberg with the links to it.
[00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:19.808]  Larry Pratt has written about this, covered this, he's the head of Governors of America.
[00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:23.970]  The good news is now ten states are moving.
[00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:34.654]  California and Colorado, and I did check into it, it's true, in 1994 passed a law saying 10th Amendment, but it's already there in the 10th Amendment.
[00:10:34.754 --> 00:10:43.338]  Other legislatures like New Hampshire have bills that say if there's gun confiscation, if there's martial law, this is H.C.R.
[00:10:43.798 --> 00:10:46.619]  6, that they're going to declare sovereignty and basically
[00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:49.644]  Fight the Feds, if need be.
[00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:51.485]  The Feds have been seized by offshore banks.
[00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:56.408]  Larry Pratt, they are making their move in Obama's first 200 days.
[00:10:56.808 --> 00:10:57.728]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:10:57.748 --> 00:10:59.409]  Can you comment on just the overall picture?
[00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.531]  And then let's get into what's happening with the Second Amendment.
[00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:07.594]  Well, we might be thinking that they're going to move first on legislation.
[00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:09.435]  And they might.
[00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:16.339]  I'm not quite as sure as I was earlier that they wouldn't want to put their own folks on
[00:11:17.063 --> 00:11:29.429]  Record voting for gun control, because Obama had, within hours of his inauguration, on the White House website, WhiteHouse.gov, a call for the renewal of the Clinton gun ban.
[00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:45.256]  That's something that I'm still not sure whether he intended just as some raw meat for his base, or whether he actually expects to move in the Congress, putting guys feet to the fire, recorded votes, before the next congressional elections, which
[00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:51.418]  Theoretically, quite possibly, could jeopardize his party's control of the Congress.
[00:11:52.399 --> 00:12:12.747]  On the other hand, since he's become president, I've become more aware of just how much of a willingness he has to exhibit his thuggishness, that he is a guy who's rather ignorant of a number of things,
[00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:22.784]  But, as is the case with many arrogant people, ignorance seems to be quite happily coexisting with the arrogance.
[00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:29.547]  So, I'm not sure, as I was, that he's not going to move legislatively.
[00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:35.369]  But, that being said, administratively, he's got a wide open field.
[00:12:35.409 --> 00:12:40.971]  He's got an Attorney General who's a gun grabber par excellence, Eric Holder.
[00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:51.966]  The right now, as I'm sure you've commented on more than once, there's a huge spike in guns and ammo sales.
[00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:57.088]  Well, of course, ammo sales don't require any federal paperwork at this time.
[00:12:57.809 --> 00:13:10.935]  But what if a dealer manages to get in a bunch of guns that have been backordered for a long time, which is the backordering is what's going on for a number of popular calibers.
[00:13:12.077 --> 00:13:15.218]  And, uh, he can't sell you the gun anyway.
[00:13:15.338 --> 00:13:16.318]  Well, why not, you ask?
[00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:17.659]  I got my money, you got the gun.
[00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:18.399]  What's the problem?
[00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:26.681]  Well, I need copies of the 4473 that the government makes me have you fill out so they can register your name.
[00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:30.382]  And, um, I'm running out of copies.
[00:13:30.462 --> 00:13:33.043]  Well, you say, well, man, that's no problem.
[00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:35.103]  Go make some copies on your copy machine.
[00:13:35.143 --> 00:13:36.084]  I see it right over there.
[00:13:36.844 --> 00:13:38.864]  Um, no, I'm not allowed to do that.
[00:13:39.005 --> 00:13:40.585]  I have to only get them from
[00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:42.243]  Unbelievable!
[00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:43.944]  This is the first time I've heard of this.
[00:13:43.964 --> 00:13:44.444]  Is this breaking news?
[00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:11.550]  It's been going on for, it's been building.
[00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.391]  You know, at first there were a few dealers complaining about it.
[00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:16.912]  Now it's becoming a more general complaint.
[00:14:17.812 --> 00:14:20.894]  Dealers have even, I know in the state of Maryland, had some meetings about it.
[00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:24.915]  But I've had reports from out in the West, everywhere.
[00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:30.057]  So, this is something that's percolating down there among the gun stores.
[00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:33.258]  And I guess it's just such a stupid, bureaucratic
[00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:37.890]  It's a problem that people can't quite believe.
[00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.310]  Well, we know it's on purpose.
[00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.350]  Of course.
[00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:50.133]  I had Aaron Zellman on a few days ago and he said flat out, he said he thinks Obama's going to stage a mass shooting or they're going to wind some lunatic up to do it.
[00:14:52.253 --> 00:14:53.694]  The economy's falling apart.
[00:14:54.814 --> 00:14:57.935]  All these top government people are saying they believe there's going to be riots everywhere.
[00:14:57.995 --> 00:14:59.135]  The Icelandic government fell.
[00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.051]  If there are riots breaking out, the answer is more guns, not less.
[00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:05.552]  Look at the Koreans and the L.A.
[00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:09.634]  riots stopping the rioting in their area when the police stood down.
[00:15:10.134 --> 00:15:11.934]  So I just want to get it out there up front.
[00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:17.977]  We don't want to see New Orleans too, but nationwide, where they don't come and give you aid, but the Army comes and takes your guns.
[00:15:17.997 --> 00:15:28.921]  Can you speak to that and speak to the fact that they're announcing NORTHCOM and the Army War College are saying 20,000 combat troops to engage the American people and their new mission is engaging the people?
[00:15:29.793 --> 00:15:52.367]  Well, if they take people's guns when the people are simply doing what they were doing after Katrina, guarding their property, they're going to have a little problem because the soldiers or the FBI agents or the marshals, whoever it might be, will be individually liable if they are working under, quote, color of law of the federal government.
[00:15:53.007 --> 00:15:55.529]  They're going to be personally liable for a lawsuit.
[00:15:55.569 --> 00:15:57.830]  This is a measure that was enacted into law
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:04.724]  Thanks to Louisiana Senator David Vitter and then Representative Bobby Jindal, now the Governor of Louisiana.
[00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:26.098]  And it says, not only would the law enforcement official be personally liable for legal expenses his department couldn't pay what could easily be tens of thousands of dollars to defend him, but if there were a monetary settlement, because this would be a civil complaint, it's not a criminal charge, but if there were a monetary settlement
[00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:28.012]  It'd be his house on the block.
[00:16:28.232 --> 00:16:30.333]  It would be his retirement on the block.
[00:16:30.453 --> 00:16:31.254]  It couldn't come out.
[00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:41.180]  But under PDD 51, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and others, it says if the President says all the laws are suspended, Congress can't even be involved.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.162]  Now that's obviously unconstitutional, but NORTHCOM doesn't care.
[00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:48.624]  I mean, we are heading towards a constitutional crisis.
[00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:55.668]  Well, it would take us right back to the kind of government we had under Abraham Lincoln, who also had a similar disregard for the
[00:16:56.089 --> 00:16:56.849]  Constitution.
[00:16:56.869 --> 00:17:11.595]  He was arresting members of state legislatures, tried to arrest members of the Supreme Court of the state of Maryland, exiled, literally exiled, a member of Congress, Van Lanningham, from Ohio, who didn't agree with him.
[00:17:13.195 --> 00:17:23.079]  This was a guy who just rode roughshod over the Constitution at the very time when the protections of the Constitution are most needed during a crisis.
[00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:25.560]  That's, of course, when tyrants say,
[00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.148]  Oh, well, we have to be given absolute powers.
[00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:40.533]  You know, I've taunted anti-gunners in the past when they were for violating privacy, when they wanted to make it easier to get convictions, when they wanted to do a number of things like that.
[00:17:40.874 --> 00:17:43.395]  I said, well, why don't you just get rid of all the Bill of Rights?
[00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:45.576]  Wouldn't that make government much more efficient?
[00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:50.058]  And at least at that time, two, three years ago, it kind of embarrassed them.
[00:17:50.598 --> 00:17:55.540]  But from what you're saying with this kind of a presidential directive,
[00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:57.755]  They're past being embarrassed.
[00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:17.840]  Does it give you a ray of sunshine to know that upwards of ten states are moving to declare sovereignty and in the bills they're saying things like, we're not going along with your martial law, we're not going along with gun confiscation, we're not going along with national compulsory service.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.360]  These are good first steps.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.761]  They need to be obviously made a lot more specific
[00:18:25.236 --> 00:18:26.337]  Have teeth put in them.
[00:18:26.937 --> 00:18:48.653]  They need to state, as the pre-War Between the States laws did, making it a null law, the Fugitive Slave Law, so that if a federal marshal tried to enforce Fugitive Slave Law, arrested a slave, say in Illinois, the laws there said, you're guilty of kidnap.
[00:18:48.713 --> 00:18:49.633]  You just broke the law.
[00:18:49.973 --> 00:18:51.214]  You can't enforce that law.
[00:18:51.815 --> 00:18:53.516]  That law's a null and void here.
[00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:54.917]  Now, when we get
[00:18:55.452 --> 00:18:55.632]  I think?
[00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:17.724]  That, hey, if you flub this one, we're out of here.
[00:19:18.064 --> 00:19:28.170]  I can spell out, they said it a little bit more... Yeah, stay there, let's come back and talk about that and talk about solutions so we can circle the wagons and not just defend the Second Amendment but take ground back that we've lost.
[00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:36.055]  Also, I was just, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, I was looking on screen, they had Gun Owners of America website up and I saw an article up there.
[00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:42.979]  Billions of dollars for MoveOn.org and ACORN with our tax money to fund gun grabbing.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.340]  You worry.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.441]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:19:46.781 --> 00:19:49.002]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:51.222]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:19:51.562 --> 00:19:52.763]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:19:53.163 --> 00:19:56.364]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:19:56.744 --> 00:20:01.625]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:05.306]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:20:05.967 --> 00:20:07.287]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:10.248]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:20:10.548 --> 00:20:13.489]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:22.179]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.023]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:20:27.463 --> 00:20:31.166]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:35.469]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:36.870]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.612]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:49.853]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:52.195]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:52.855 --> 00:20:53.896]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:54.416 --> 00:20:54.936]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:55.216 --> 00:20:56.137]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:56.177 --> 00:20:57.558]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:57.578 --> 00:20:59.239]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:06.322]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:07.163]  Some U.S.
[00:21:07.203 --> 00:21:12.846]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:13.546 --> 00:21:17.047]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:17.427 --> 00:21:27.291]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:27.511 --> 00:21:28.271]  Fabled enemies.
[00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:36.014]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:36.514 --> 00:21:39.855]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:43.266 --> 00:21:49.491]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:57.717]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:58.057 --> 00:22:05.943]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:06.223 --> 00:22:10.987]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:11.308 --> 00:22:15.965]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:16.522 --> 00:22:20.383]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:20.883 --> 00:22:21.883]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:21.963 --> 00:22:26.044]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:26.464 --> 00:22:30.845]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:31.365 --> 00:22:33.926]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:34.366 --> 00:22:36.007]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:36.367]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:43.092 --> 00:22:50.736]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:22:51.177 --> 00:22:52.337]  You need the Paclite.
[00:22:52.778 --> 00:23:00.622]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:23:00.982 --> 00:23:04.164]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:23:04.564 --> 00:23:08.987]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:10.668]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:23:10.928 --> 00:23:15.329]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.051]  The Paclite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:27.093]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlight.com.
[00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:30.494]  That address again is 9voltlight.com.
[00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:32.415]  Or, call us today at 877-715-8000.
[00:23:35.356 --> 00:23:35.817]  4448, that's 877-715-4448.
[00:23:56.039 --> 00:24:05.484]  Folks, I told you a year ago with Larry Pratt that the gun grabbers were coming, that they were the only real gun organization, that the NRA was actually founded and carries out gun control.
[00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.485]  He read all their quotes, the documents.
[00:24:09.286 --> 00:24:11.747]  And a lot of people thought, oh, Bush is in, everything's fine.
[00:24:11.887 --> 00:24:13.228]  And now you're seeing what's happening.
[00:24:13.308 --> 00:24:15.009]  Join Gun Owners of America today.
[00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:23.193]  Larry, give folks the phone number and the website for people to join, or at least get on the free email alerts list, so that, I mean, we can defend the Second Amendment.
[00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:33.193]  Well, the phone number toll-free is 888-6GUNS, that's 888-886, and then the letters G-U-N-S.
[00:24:33.853 --> 00:24:47.936]  But the easiest way to get to us is the web, gunowners.org, and if you go there, you can get a free subscription to our email alerts, and those enable people to fire off email to their members of Congress.
[00:24:48.916 --> 00:24:53.657]  I don't know what we're going to be able to stop, but I can tell you that we know from
[00:24:54.138 --> 00:24:55.659]  We're good to go.
[00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:25.049]  Yeah, I mean, I asked people a year ago on show after show, at least go sign up for the free email alert.
[00:25:25.129 --> 00:25:28.530]  The NRA is not going to give you these, and I'm not attacking NRA members.
[00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.511]  We're stating the historical fact.
[00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:45.735]  It's a Judas goat, and Larry would never go on air and really try to bash and do that, but he started doing it a year ago, and because he went over the history, their quotes, they helped pass the 1968 Gun Control Act, started all this instant check and registration we have today, and
[00:25:47.495 --> 00:25:55.797]  The Second Amendment is on a razor's edge right now, and they're not even sending the forms out to most of the gun dealers now.
[00:25:56.617 --> 00:25:57.717]  The guns are selling out.
[00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:01.158]  They're moving against the Second Amendment.
[00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:02.498]  You need to be members.
[00:26:02.538 --> 00:26:03.858]  They need financial support.
[00:26:03.978 --> 00:26:06.259]  They're the only real lobbyists we've got on the Hill.
[00:26:06.979 --> 00:26:10.300]  Larry Pratt, give them the number again, and tell them how much the memberships cost.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:15.081]  It's all at $20, and you can call and get information for membership at 888-888.
[00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:17.532]  Six guns.
[00:26:17.632 --> 00:26:21.835]  That's 888-886, and then the letters G-U-N-S.
[00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:31.961]  Or they can simply go to gunowners.org, and in addition to that free subscription for the email alerts, anybody can join up there also at that same website.
[00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:32.922]  Twenty bucks.
[00:26:33.262 --> 00:26:42.948]  We'd be happy to have them sign up for time payments or full payment as a life member, but we just would like to be able to pay the rent.
[00:26:43.088 --> 00:26:46.410]  As a friend of mine said, you can't save the world if you can't pay the rent.
[00:26:48.109 --> 00:27:04.834]  Larry, folks weren't listening last year, but I was talking during the break, a lot of folks are joining now, or at least signing up for the free email alerts, because they now understand we weren't playing games, and we told them last year, the BATF, radically expanding its size, its new building, its harassment, I mean, they are coming for the guns.
[00:27:04.854 --> 00:27:08.715]  I'll give you another example of what's being done administratively.
[00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:12.796]  We were successful in blocking Mike Sullivan, a U.S.
[00:27:12.856 --> 00:27:16.857]  attorney from Boston, and a personal friend of Ted Kennedy,
[00:27:18.191 --> 00:27:41.811]  Well, I'm not sure for how much longer, because Kennedy seems to be in poor health, but in any case, Sullivan was the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Farms, and Explosives, and during his hearing to be the full-time permanent director, kind of an appointment as the same as the FBI head, Ted Kennedy said that he looked forward to working with Sullivan on gun control.
[00:27:42.772 --> 00:27:46.035]  Well, we were successful in blocking Mike Sullivan
[00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:51.871]  from getting a permanent job as the head of the BATFE.
[00:27:52.691 --> 00:28:16.027]  But on his way out, on the 14th of January, six days before the inauguration of the Messiah, the BATFE filed a notice of proposed rulemaking, which Gun Owners of America will be addressing well before the expiration of time.
[00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:34.043]  And in that, it does something that they had been seeking legislatively, because they arguably would have somewhat more justification by law, although there is no law that can justify anything that the BATFE does, because it's an unconstitutional entity.
[00:28:34.383 --> 00:28:44.731]  But in any case, this proposed rule would let some, any, unnamed, uncounted bureaucrat in
[00:28:45.253 --> 00:28:56.718]  Boyzie in Fort Lauderdale, whatever field office that the Bureau might have, yank a dealer's license and that that would be the final word.
[00:28:57.458 --> 00:29:00.139]  Well, there goes your due process.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.324]  There's not even necessarily any standard procedures.
[00:29:05.904 --> 00:29:06.444]  Stay there.
[00:29:06.484 --> 00:29:06.845]  Stay there.
[00:29:06.905 --> 00:29:07.805]  Do five more minutes.
[00:29:08.166 --> 00:29:10.548]  I want to finish up with this and talk about solutions.
[00:29:10.588 --> 00:29:15.611]  But that's what they're wanting to pass a bill where Holder can just ban any guns he wants.
[00:29:16.252 --> 00:29:17.713]  It gives him this imperial power.
[00:29:18.334 --> 00:29:24.698]  So we see everything being converted to the agencies under the National Security Council having this new unlimited power.
[00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:26.019]  Larry Pratt's our guest.
[00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:26.500]  Stay with us.
[00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:36.794]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:40.496]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:43.938 --> 00:29:47.581]  When times get tough, we must all decide what's most important in life.
[00:29:47.901 --> 00:29:52.924]  At EnduringRose.com, we believe that lasting relationships are what make life most meaningful.
[00:29:53.364 --> 00:29:57.647]  Showing our loved ones that we care is what helps us find happiness in an uncertain world.
[00:29:58.187 --> 00:29:59.428]  Enduring Rose can help.
[00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:05.954]  We have taken real roses, the universal symbols of love, and coated them in eternal and precious 24 karat gold.

[00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.251]  EnduringRose.com or call 702-453-7455.
[00:30:36.271 --> 00:30:36.651]  That's 702-453-7455.
[00:30:45.355 --> 00:30:49.978]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:53.321]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:30:53.401 --> 00:30:56.243]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:30:56.283 --> 00:30:59.925]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:31:16.278 --> 00:31:16.859]  Inside, John.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.361]  How dare you?
[00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:25.745]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:25.765 --> 00:31:28.547]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:28.647 --> 00:31:35.072]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:31:35.112 --> 00:31:37.694]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:31:37.954 --> 00:31:39.916]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:31:40.216 --> 00:31:42.698]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:31:45.307 --> 00:31:50.608]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:31:51.068 --> 00:31:52.809]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:31:53.349 --> 00:31:54.829]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.050]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:02.991]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:32:03.472 --> 00:32:08.873]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement
[00:32:13.803 --> 00:32:14.003]  Listen,
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.402]  We are going to have open phones for the balance of the transmission when Larry Pratt leaves us.
[00:33:03.063 --> 00:33:09.607]  And I'm going to take five calls, cover a news story, take five calls, cover a news story.
[00:33:09.627 --> 00:33:12.588]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us.
[00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:17.171]  We have an hour and 27 minutes left in this transmission.
[00:33:17.891 --> 00:33:20.793]  Larry, I saw him triple the size of the BATFE.
[00:33:20.913 --> 00:33:22.714]  I saw him build the biggest federal building anywhere.
[00:33:24.122 --> 00:33:24.663]  In D.C.
[00:33:24.723 --> 00:33:26.684]  I saw Bush support the assault weapons ban.
[00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:33.851]  I would have gun show, you know, people argue with me, or a guy at a gun shop argue with me, saying I was a liar.
[00:33:34.511 --> 00:33:36.453]  I knew they were harassing gun shops and dealers.
[00:33:36.493 --> 00:33:41.638]  I knew they were using extrajudicial, just executive, bureaucratic authority to do this.
[00:33:41.658 --> 00:33:42.638]  We're just talking about Holder.
[00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:46.680]  With a bill introduced to give him unlimited power to ban any guns he wants.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.640]  It says it in the bill.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:55.643]  National registration, national federal testing, psychological records, misdemeanors, can't own a gun, no fly list, can't have a gun.
[00:33:55.663 --> 00:33:58.744]  Well they just put over a million Americans innocently on those.
[00:33:59.164 --> 00:33:59.804]  A black list.
[00:34:00.564 --> 00:34:06.626]  All of this is happening, and I keep trying to tell the listeners, now I guess they're finally listening, record gun sales, but a lot of places they can't buy them.
[00:34:07.026 --> 00:34:14.388]  See, I've gotten emails about that, but Larry Pratt wasn't telling me, and I didn't have time to track it down, about how a lot of these gun shops can't even sell guns now because they won't send them the yellow forms.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:27.366]  I want to put the call out again to listeners, because JPFO makes films, writes books, is more of a think tank studying the gun grabbers, and I know you work with them, Jews Preservation and Firearms Ownership.
[00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:30.768]  It's one of the only national organizations other than you, but it's small.
[00:34:30.828 --> 00:34:35.431]  You've got 250-something thousand members next to the NRA, two or three million, it's always changing.
[00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:42.275]  And when we say the NRA, and I want you briefly to go into this, but then finish up your story from earlier first.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:51.645]  about just the bureaucracy, you know, saying we can shut down any gun show or gun shop we want without an arrest, without an indictment, without a claim.
[00:34:52.446 --> 00:34:56.348]  We ink your license, kind of like Americans can't own guns on the new terror watch list.
[00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.710]  Homeland Security says you won't be able to buy or sell.
[00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.411]  Your credit cards are going to be turned off.
[00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:02.212]  You're like, how do I get off this list?
[00:35:02.472 --> 00:35:03.893]  Haven't paid taxes, they're going to turn it off.
[00:35:04.113 --> 00:35:06.215]  It's not just the no-fly list, folks, it's a database.
[00:35:06.895 --> 00:35:08.156]  There's a lot I'm throwing out here.
[00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:10.618]  The point is, one more time, gun owners
[00:35:11.886 --> 00:35:14.407]  .org and the toll-free number.
[00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:30.633]  If people don't get a $20 membership, if they don't sign up for the free alerts, if they don't become LIFE members, you're the only real big group we've got that I know is good and I know is lobbying and I know has a track record and I know it's always been you guys that have beaten stuff.
[00:35:31.053 --> 00:35:32.614]  It hasn't been the NRA.
[00:35:34.475 --> 00:35:38.056]  And the people gotta know this, so tell folks how to join.
[00:35:39.076 --> 00:35:52.909]  Well, get information through the mail sent to you by calling our toll-free number, 888-6-GUNS, or 888-886, and the letters G-U-N-S.
[00:35:53.469 --> 00:36:00.155]  But for most people, I think, who have a computer, definitely easiest to go to gunowners.org.
[00:36:00.756 --> 00:36:05.500]  There they can get both the email alerts, which is a freebie, and then they can sign up
[00:36:06.152 --> 00:36:22.322]  As a member, they'll get a newsletter, they'll get legislative mailings on some of the more proactive projects that we're working on that are not as time sensitive as the ones that are dealt with by the email, which are things that just come up all of a sudden and have a very short fuse on them.
[00:36:23.123 --> 00:36:27.226]  And there'll be things that we just don't even, we can't even mail on.
[00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:28.947]  There's so many things going on like this.
[00:36:29.247 --> 00:36:35.691]  I'm not sure whether we'll ever get to the mail on this notion that the dealers can be shut down now by some
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:36.500]  I think?
[00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:50.817]  Really, nothing type of complaints.
[00:36:51.258 --> 00:37:01.865]  And we've talked about it before, maybe that they let three or four customers do an abbreviation for Baltimore, BLTO, instead of writing it out Baltimore.
[00:37:02.245 --> 00:37:06.128]  Yeah, they're coming in and they're white glove inspecting everything.
[00:37:06.448 --> 00:37:08.729]  They're shutting down gun shops everywhere.
[00:37:08.749 --> 00:37:12.011]  They've introduced bills to shut down the gun shows, private transfer.
[00:37:12.512 --> 00:37:15.454]  But you're saying this was done as he left.
[00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:16.815]  They just did it by fiat.
[00:37:16.875 --> 00:37:17.035]  No.
[00:37:17.976 --> 00:37:19.977]  Law and Congress know nothing.
[00:37:20.337 --> 00:37:21.618]  This is going on now.
[00:37:21.718 --> 00:37:23.840]  Now the gun shops are even in more terror.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.280]  Right.
[00:37:24.581 --> 00:37:26.542]  It's a proposed rule.
[00:37:26.842 --> 00:37:29.845]  Sometime in April is the deadline for filing comments.
[00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:44.596]  We're not going to suggest that most of our members would enjoy writing directly to the Bureau, but we are going to make it so that they can do a little raining of email and comment to their members of Congress, so their members of Congress realize that
[00:37:45.011 --> 00:37:46.232]  They don't do something about this.
[00:37:46.252 --> 00:37:50.895]  This is just going to be one more reason not to vote for them in two years.
[00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:53.257]  Well, absolutely.
[00:37:54.457 --> 00:37:56.799]  On the subject, just briefly, the NRA.
[00:37:57.419 --> 00:38:03.964]  Just give people a snapshot of what you've covered in the past, that this really is a gun control group.
[00:38:04.524 --> 00:38:14.291]  Well, the biggest disappointment was their complete blindness to the Veterans Disarmament Act, as we called it, because it targeted veterans first.
[00:38:14.867 --> 00:38:21.289]  You're going to lose your right to keep and bear arms without even a smidgen of due process.
[00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:33.493]  No trial, no jury, no real judge, no real court, no lawyer, no expert witnesses, no cross-examination, no confronting your adversary, your accuser.
[00:38:34.573 --> 00:38:41.095]  You go before some bureaucrat and you don't even go before him, actually, in the case of
[00:38:41.547 --> 00:38:50.725]  The veterans, if they get a diagnosis that says they have something like post-traumatic stress disorder, that they might be a danger to self or others.
[00:38:51.674 --> 00:38:51.974]  Boom.
[00:38:52.174 --> 00:38:53.495]  They've just lost their gun rights.
[00:38:53.976 --> 00:39:00.739]  And Holder has said they're going to expand this to everybody and even get juvenile crime records and juvenile psychology records.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.523]  Most of America has been sent to a psychologist at one time or the other because they advertise it's the thing to do.
[00:39:08.004 --> 00:39:08.504]  It's over!
[00:39:09.464 --> 00:39:19.030]  The bill that we call the Veterans Disarmament Act, which I repeat, was simply named that by us because they were the first in the crosshairs
[00:39:19.397 --> 00:39:28.520]  But as you're saying, all they need to do is appropriate the money that was authorized in that bill, and they're going to come after everybody else's medical records.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.820]  It doesn't matter whether they were a veteran or not.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:43.844]  All they have to do is have some indication that, as you say, you've been to a psychiatrist and he has found in some way a diagnosis that might make you a danger to self or others.
[00:39:44.451 --> 00:39:50.715]  That might could be perhaps one... And they do that, they do that for everybody because they tell people go to it, they go to get you on insurance.
[00:39:51.176 --> 00:39:54.878]  I'm gonna give you this diagnosis, there's literally close to a thousand different ones.
[00:39:55.359 --> 00:40:00.122]  Even criticizing the government seen as a mental illness now they have over a hundred designations there.
[00:40:00.482 --> 00:40:01.403]  This isn't your opinion.
[00:40:01.943 --> 00:40:07.708]  In the bill that the current White House Chief of Staff introduced last year when he was in the House of Representatives from Illinois,
[00:40:08.766 --> 00:40:11.467]  And he supported the total Chicago gun ban, the DC gun ban.
[00:40:11.687 --> 00:40:12.148]  Sure.
[00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:14.669]  Holder argued before the Supreme Court for a total gun ban.
[00:40:14.689 --> 00:40:16.330]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:30.297]  They've introduced that bill again, and I know you know this for the audience, that says you'll be federally tested and federally licensed and all your psychological records must be provided by you in indentured servitude.
[00:40:30.317 --> 00:40:31.678]  You go before a federal board
[00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:46.731]  That's how they basically banned guns in New York 30-40 years ago, saying, oh, you can get a gun once you go to our board, once you get a psychological test, and then they just don't have the board meeting once every six months and you can't get on the list, so through bureaucracy you never get the gun.
[00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:49.934]  And even if they give you an opinion,
[00:40:50.796 --> 00:40:51.416]  What do you do?
[00:40:51.597 --> 00:40:53.198]  You don't have a court trial there.
[00:40:53.358 --> 00:40:55.239]  You don't have any due process there.
[00:40:55.699 --> 00:40:57.160]  You're flat out of luck.
[00:40:57.661 --> 00:41:05.666]  It's just some folks that have some process that you may not even be aware of and they render an opinion and says we don't find you fit to own a gun.
[00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:07.407]  Now they do that by fiat.
[00:41:08.388 --> 00:41:15.633]  When you can't get a gun, then you call, then you gotta file paperwork, pay for a lawyer yourself, and then maybe get a hearing with a kangaroo court.
[00:41:16.053 --> 00:41:19.035]  It'll be a kangaroo court because it'll be a hearing
[00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:25.779]  That considers a record that's already been produced by this body that screwed you to begin with.
[00:41:26.199 --> 00:41:38.567]  It's not as if you go into a court where you're supposed to have a clean slate, the government is accusing you, the burden of proof is on them, and then you start from there to build a record in a normal trial proceeding.
[00:41:39.527 --> 00:41:49.033]  The trial that they'll be talking about is more like an appeal where the only thing that can be considered is the record brought in from the lower quote court.
[00:41:49.605 --> 00:42:01.890]  Well, since they've already got about, for instance, when the BATFE does this right now to dealers with their administrative law procedures, there's a 95% zapping of the dealer.
[00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:10.073]  So if a poor dealer wants to appeal to a federal court, even though the law says the court's supposed to give him that brand new trial, they don't.
[00:42:10.273 --> 00:42:12.414]  They accept the record of the bureaucrat.
[00:42:14.435 --> 00:42:27.019]  Yeah, so they're putting our entire Second Amendment into a bureaucratic system, expanding the narrow bureaucratic powers they got under the 1968 Gun Control Act to fully savage the Second Amendment outside any judicial system.
[00:42:27.499 --> 00:42:31.820]  Outside is the key, because that was supposed to be short of the bullet box.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:41.303]  The jury box was supposed to be our ultimate defense of our free society, of our free state, to use the term of the Second Amendment.
[00:42:41.855 --> 00:42:55.143]  And if the jury isn't even involved, they're so afraid of us that even though they often feed us like mushrooms and get juries to do things that if the jurors really knew what was going on, they wouldn't rule the way they do.
[00:42:55.663 --> 00:42:57.224]  But they don't even want to take that chance.
[00:42:57.284 --> 00:42:59.966]  And so they just bypass the jury altogether.
[00:42:59.986 --> 00:43:10.412]  Because when you go into that federal court, the jury is never going to, if there is a jury, they're never going to hear any of your real case because that's already been
[00:43:10.967 --> 00:43:12.029]  Well, the good news is...
[00:43:23.655 --> 00:43:25.096]  I've seen the numbers from the FBI.
[00:43:25.196 --> 00:43:35.201]  Forty-five percent, no, forty-four percent, the previous highest record, now four months running, with guns being purchased and ammo being purchased.
[00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:42.964]  And if they tried it with this bureaucratic thing, not a lot of people have the forms, that's just going to make people understand how real this is.
[00:43:43.645 --> 00:43:48.087]  And so I think they're overreaching right now, and I think it's going to backfire, because I've seen the polls.
[00:43:48.447 --> 00:43:49.828]  You're more aware of this than I am, but
[00:43:50.888 --> 00:43:57.191]  Back in the seventies and eighties, they brainwashed close to half the public to support more reasonable, in quote, gun control.
[00:43:57.611 --> 00:43:59.913]  But since then, I see most of the polls 70, 75, 80 percent.
[00:43:59.953 --> 00:44:00.973]  Correct.
[00:44:01.213 --> 00:44:02.374]  The young people are into it.
[00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:03.895]  Liberals, I know, are buying guns.
[00:44:04.155 --> 00:44:05.936]  They learned mistrust of government under Bush.
[00:44:06.016 --> 00:44:07.416]  Now they're starting to not trust Obama.
[00:44:07.837 --> 00:44:16.021]  People are really fundamentally getting it now, and we're winning the hearts and minds in the gun culture, the Second Amendment culture this country was founded on.
[00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:18.822]  You know, it all started, folks, when the Redcoats came to take the guns.
[00:44:20.703 --> 00:44:21.904]  I think we're going to kick their ass.
[00:44:21.984 --> 00:44:22.985]  I'm sorry to use that term.
[00:44:23.425 --> 00:44:25.387]  Well, I hope that's correct.
[00:44:25.607 --> 00:44:30.651]  I see what you're talking about, and you're not making that up.
[00:44:31.152 --> 00:44:40.079]  On the other hand, we can't forget that the government schools have been doing their job, and they've been cranking out lots of voters that think it's really cool to vote against
[00:44:40.475 --> 00:44:41.836]  Freedom against liberty.
[00:44:41.856 --> 00:44:43.437]  I have no idea what I'm going to write.
[00:44:43.457 --> 00:44:45.658]  Sure, but my point is, I'm not saying we're even winning.
[00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:47.019]  We're showing some fight.
[00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:47.820]  We're growing.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.762]  They're moving against us, and I'm telling folks, this is the fight.
[00:44:51.162 --> 00:44:52.823]  This is 1776, Part 2.
[00:44:54.184 --> 00:44:55.165]  True.
[00:44:55.325 --> 00:45:09.434]  In that sense, I think you are correct, and I would agree, because they are going to substantially alienate a significant minority of the American people, and the arrogance that I've seen in Obama
[00:45:09.844 --> 00:45:14.509]  Which seems to go along with his South Chicago thuggishness.
[00:45:15.029 --> 00:45:17.191]  Could very well end up turning people off.
[00:45:18.813 --> 00:45:19.614]  Well, let's hope so.
[00:45:20.394 --> 00:45:22.617]  Well, the left, he's gone back on every promise to them.
[00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:28.622]  We're starting to see cracks in the facade as they realize he's bought and paid for by the very same interest.
[00:45:28.983 --> 00:45:30.524]  What I'm getting at here, Larry Pratt, is
[00:45:31.485 --> 00:45:38.567]  I don't want them to come after the guns, but I know they've been creeping around trying it forever, and in a way, part of me just says, you know what?
[00:45:39.008 --> 00:45:40.548]  Let's go ahead and get this show on the road.
[00:45:41.148 --> 00:45:41.468]  You know what?
[00:45:41.509 --> 00:45:43.269]  You just want to keep pushing and pushing.
[00:45:43.809 --> 00:45:45.590]  I know how the country was founded.
[00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.310]  I know how it's going to be founded again.
[00:45:47.751 --> 00:45:48.471]  You can't help it.
[00:45:48.491 --> 00:45:50.572]  You're going to use the military against the Second Amendment.
[00:45:50.912 --> 00:46:00.095]  The military is going to come over to our side, and we're going to arrest every one of you foreign bankers that have been running your scams, and we're going to try you with a jury of your peers, and you're going to the Who Scout.
[00:46:00.794 --> 00:46:08.141]  Well, better sooner than later, because they are, in the long run, working a very effective plan to dumb down the American people.
[00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:14.046]  And if they overplay their hand now, better now than sometime in the future.
[00:46:14.066 --> 00:46:19.111]  I quite agree that sooner rather than later would be to our favor.
[00:46:19.966 --> 00:46:23.048]  Yeah, let's get the show on the road, whether that be peaceful or whatever it is.
[00:46:23.508 --> 00:46:26.109]  Let's defend the Republic to the end.
[00:46:26.169 --> 00:46:31.412]  Larry Pratt, I want to really thank you for spending time with us in these very, very dark days.
[00:46:32.232 --> 00:46:39.256]  But we will continue to track all of this at GunOwnersOfAmerica, GunOwners.org.
[00:46:39.736 --> 00:46:44.679]  And folks can also call the 703-321-8585 number.
[00:46:44.719 --> 00:46:45.439]  Is that good as well?
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.461]  That'll work too, and that's what people often call if they
[00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:51.447]  Have some question about a legislative issue.
[00:46:52.497 --> 00:46:54.538]  That's where our policy guys are.
[00:46:55.418 --> 00:46:57.219]  And folks, don't think they're omnipresent.
[00:46:57.279 --> 00:47:11.803]  If you see gun bills introduced at your state level or federal, or you see things going on, or you see gun grabbers giving anti-American speeches, let Gun Owners of America know, because they're on YouTube now, and Facebook, and they've got a Web 2.0 site, and they are kicking Hind in.
[00:47:11.903 --> 00:47:14.044]  And Larry Pratt, it's just great being associated with you.
[00:47:14.084 --> 00:47:14.604]  God bless you.
[00:47:14.784 --> 00:47:15.384]  Well, same here.
[00:47:15.444 --> 00:47:16.244]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[00:47:16.845 --> 00:47:17.145]  You bet.
[00:47:17.165 --> 00:47:18.325]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:18.425 --> 00:47:21.486]  Larry Pratt, the head of Gun Owners of America.
[00:47:24.744 --> 00:47:25.985]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:47:26.005 --> 00:47:27.206]  We're going to do that in the next segment.
[00:47:27.226 --> 00:47:30.148]  I'm kind of like somebody who's got to clean the garage out.
[00:47:30.228 --> 00:47:32.590]  I'm looking at it and I'm like, I don't want to get started on this.
[00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.491]  I'm procrastinating.
[00:47:33.511 --> 00:47:36.473]  And then I get started and you finally clean the garage out.
[00:47:37.393 --> 00:47:40.576]  When it comes to covering this news, I mean, this is horrifying.
[00:47:41.216 --> 00:47:43.738]  People, I don't try to get up here and make the government look bad.
[00:47:44.018 --> 00:47:46.320]  I don't try to get up here and explain just how serious it is.
[00:47:49.703 --> 00:47:52.024]  It's so much worse than I could even explain to you.
[00:47:52.445 --> 00:47:53.926]  I mean, I've got Bloomberg right here.
[00:47:56.365 --> 00:48:02.510]  And I, and it, I couldn't believe it this morning, and I went and looked up the bills, because they're always adding new stuff to the bailout.
[00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.791]  Excuse me.
[00:48:05.352 --> 00:48:09.075]  And the government will decide what health care you get, even if you have insurance.
[00:48:09.435 --> 00:48:12.397]  There'll be rationing of people 55 or older.
[00:48:13.018 --> 00:48:14.739]  Give me a close shot somewhere.
[00:48:15.479 --> 00:48:16.400]  How about that camera over there?
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.062]  I want to show people this article.
[00:48:19.102 --> 00:48:20.523]  Or we could just punch it up on screen.
[00:48:22.144 --> 00:48:24.026]  Ruin your health with the Obama Stimulus Plan.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.544]  And I want you to go read this, and then I want you to go to the bill itself and read it for yourself.
[00:48:33.767 --> 00:48:40.574]  Then it says it's the British model to be adopted, where if you're older you will not be given the treatments you need.
[00:48:42.035 --> 00:48:43.517]  Medicare, Medicaid, you name it.
[00:48:44.077 --> 00:48:46.380]  I mean, you know, you thought socialist healthcare was bad.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.441]  People are like, oh, I want free healthcare.
[00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:48.883]  You didn't free Jack!
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.802]  Once you're in a socialist system, everybody's like, don't treat those old people!
[00:48:52.982 --> 00:48:54.063]  They're taking all the money!
[00:48:54.083 --> 00:48:55.324]  I only want it for me!
[00:48:55.384 --> 00:48:58.186]  And then they can play the population off against each other.
[00:48:58.586 --> 00:48:59.727]  It's all in here.
[00:48:59.747 --> 00:49:00.968]  I'm going to get to that after calls.
[00:49:01.928 --> 00:49:02.949]  The faith-based stuff.
[00:49:03.029 --> 00:49:05.131]  I mean, this article out of Newsweek.
[00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:10.775]  I mean, you can't... This is telling you how great socialism is and how wonderful it is.
[00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:12.396]  This isn't socialism!
[00:49:13.564 --> 00:49:25.547]  Trillions of dollars to offshore banks, to then come back and loan the government its own money back at interest, and to come in and buy off your cities, and Acorn is going to get two billion dollars from Obama?
[00:49:27.128 --> 00:49:29.629]  And Bush was doing all this too, at all these grips.
[00:49:29.669 --> 00:49:36.031]  These are rent-a-mobs that the media and the news can point at and say, oh, there's our constituents.
[00:49:38.731 --> 00:49:40.852]  And national drafts and all of this stuff.
[00:49:46.963 --> 00:49:49.125]  Man, I can repeat it over and over again, it makes my head spin.
[00:49:50.346 --> 00:49:52.968]  You heard Larry Pratt saying he can't keep track of it all now either.
[00:49:52.988 --> 00:50:08.300]  They're just hitting us from every side, but the good news is it's so unconstitutional, it's so classically tyrannical, despotic, authoritarian, it's so classically evil.
[00:50:09.565 --> 00:50:13.087]  And you've got the politicians that comes out in the news.
[00:50:13.107 --> 00:50:16.049]  65% or more of Congress doesn't pay income taxes.
[00:50:16.489 --> 00:50:17.589]  The bankers don't pay.
[00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.311]  Fortune 500 companies don't pay taxes.
[00:50:20.331 --> 00:50:21.111]  Their employees do.
[00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:22.132]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:50:22.332 --> 00:50:23.633]  They wrote the laws for themselves.
[00:50:23.713 --> 00:50:27.195]  It's foreign banks have hijacked the country.
[00:50:27.575 --> 00:50:29.136]  It's an illegitimate government.
[00:50:29.895 --> 00:50:33.241]  People email me and go, you right-wing bastard, we're gonna get you, you don't like Obama.
[00:50:33.482 --> 00:50:36.207]  Hey, idiots, I wrote the book on attacking George Bush.
[00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:38.571]  But he's a puppet and so's Obama.
[00:50:38.832 --> 00:50:40.535]  See, pass that to the bankers.
[00:50:40.795 --> 00:50:42.018]  Don't be a sucker!
[00:50:44.039 --> 00:50:49.501]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:50:49.542 --> 00:50:50.062]  and the world.
[00:50:50.342 --> 00:50:53.783]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:50:54.204 --> 00:51:00.426]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:51:00.706 --> 00:51:02.487]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:51:02.727 --> 00:51:10.671]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:51:10.951 --> 00:51:15.373]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:51:15.653 --> 00:51:21.196]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:51:21.456 --> 00:51:23.457]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:51:23.637 --> 00:51:25.878]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:51:26.238 --> 00:51:27.019]  Free of charge.
[00:51:27.319 --> 00:51:30.862]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.

[00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:36.566]  Factory direct.
[00:51:36.746 --> 00:51:38.727]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:51:38.988 --> 00:51:41.069]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:51:41.169 --> 00:51:49.395]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:49.755 --> 00:51:51.417]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.396]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:53.936 --> 00:51:54.417]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:54.737 --> 00:51:55.738]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:51:55.758 --> 00:51:57.039]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:57.079 --> 00:51:58.740]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:05.826]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:06.666]  Some U.S.
[00:52:06.706 --> 00:52:12.391]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:13.051 --> 00:52:16.592]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:16.932 --> 00:52:26.794]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:27.034 --> 00:52:27.774]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:52:35.996 --> 00:52:39.357]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:45.112]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:45.232 --> 00:52:50.413]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:52:50.594 --> 00:52:51.934]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:52:52.194 --> 00:53:00.377]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:53:00.597 --> 00:53:06.319]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:53:06.499 --> 00:53:08.280]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.500]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.882]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:53:15.042 --> 00:53:17.162]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:54:05.151 --> 00:54:06.632]  Okay, we are back live.
[00:54:06.652 --> 00:54:07.914]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:54:08.094 --> 00:54:10.696]  Al in New York, you are on the air.
[00:54:10.716 --> 00:54:13.018]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:54:13.298 --> 00:54:13.919]  Hello, my friend.
[00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:16.961]  How you doing?
[00:54:17.102 --> 00:54:26.350]  I'm 24 years old, and I've been following the alternative media and your fight against the New World Order, and it inspired me to go into college and take up political science.
[00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:31.114]  I was wondering, how can I use that degree to help people and fight the New World Order?
[00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:45.559]  Well, I'm not saying it's bad for you to go to college, but you'll just get in massive debt, and they'll teach you a false political paradigm with most political science degrees, but that can also, you know, help you with that perspective of the false map they download into your brain, basically.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:55:00.010]  I wouldn't wait to go get a political science degree to go out and warn people and wake people up, but, I mean, I don't think it's bad for you to get a degree, but, I mean, you're just not going to find a lot of work in government if you're opposing their criminal operations.
[00:55:01.889 --> 00:55:03.694]  So you suggest journalism?
[00:55:03.714 --> 00:55:04.816]  Because I thought about that too.
[00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:11.334]  Yeah, but I mean, the old media is imploding as people know they're a pack of criminal liars or a pack of people spinning things.
[00:55:12.094 --> 00:55:21.602]  I mean, I started taking RTF in college, but I went and started an AXS TV show, and six months later had a weekend show, and six months after that had a daily show, and a year after that had a syndicated show.
[00:55:22.202 --> 00:55:24.104]  So, I mean, it's just best to go out and do it.
[00:55:24.144 --> 00:55:31.610]  It's best to start a website now or get with somebody and work with them and, you know, go out and do citizen reports and then get a sponsor or two and just do it that way.
[00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:33.890]  I mean, it's best to not wait in life.
[00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:38.491]  It's best to, you know, just bust your hind end now and start reporting on things now.
[00:55:38.511 --> 00:55:40.792]  I see.
[00:55:40.832 --> 00:55:42.132]  Thanks a lot for your advice, Alex.
[00:55:42.452 --> 00:55:43.272]  Thank you so much.
[00:55:43.292 --> 00:55:44.132]  Appreciate your call.
[00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:46.653]  Ken in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:55:47.633 --> 00:55:48.213]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:48.793 --> 00:55:49.193]  Hello, sir.
[00:55:49.213 --> 00:55:49.433]  Mom?
[00:55:50.093 --> 00:55:50.573]  Yes, you are.
[00:55:51.113 --> 00:55:51.433]  Sorry.
[00:55:51.834 --> 00:55:52.774]  I have two questions.
[00:55:52.794 --> 00:55:54.814]  The first one, have you heard of the Continental Congress?
[00:55:56.214 --> 00:55:58.115]  I know that they had a Continental Congress in 1770.
[00:56:01.994 --> 00:56:17.181]  They're forming one right now, and I think they're going to have a meeting between now and March 1st, and I encourage everyone to get involved, because they're going to try to find a way over a period of a month... Oh, you're talking about a... Yeah, you're talking about a con-con.
[00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:19.782]  You're talking about they want to try to amend the Constitution.
[00:56:20.103 --> 00:56:23.264]  Yes, they'll need two more states to get it done.
[00:56:24.245 --> 00:56:27.126]  If you go to We The People Foundation,
[00:56:27.566 --> 00:56:30.988]  You're talking about Bob Schultz separately doing those, and that's fine.
[00:56:31.008 --> 00:56:33.089]  There's been a lot of citizen continental congresses.
[00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:36.110]  I think really we have the legislatures already there with the authority.
[00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.672]  We need to go in and have the legislatures say,
[00:56:57.361 --> 00:57:06.569]  You know, the federal government is now bankrupt and foreign and has been hijacked and the states need to vote to reconstitute the federal government and have these people arrested.
[00:57:06.989 --> 00:57:09.010]  We need to have state grand juries start indictments.
[00:57:09.531 --> 00:57:11.112]  I'm not poo-pooing Bob Shultz.
[00:57:11.132 --> 00:57:12.774]  We need to get him back on in a million years.
[00:57:13.574 --> 00:57:24.623]  It's just that meeting across from, you know, in Philadelphia or whatever and coming up with a plan, I think that's fine too, but I mean right now we've got ten states moving to declare sovereignty.
[00:57:24.823 --> 00:57:26.725]  It was seven last week or eight last week.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.160]  Can I ask one more question?
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:31.540]  Sure.
[00:57:32.301 --> 00:57:38.963]  Yeah, I don't know if you know, or maybe your listeners know, these new converter boxes, a lot of people I know are wanting to get them.
[00:57:39.463 --> 00:57:44.884]  Do they have a microphone in them to spy on people, like some of the cable boxes do, or do you know?
[00:57:44.944 --> 00:57:48.285]  The scientific Atlantic boxes have a microphone.
[00:57:49.486 --> 00:57:55.308]  Google now, with the cameras and microphones on computers, does dial in with an AI computer and record everything going on in your house.
[00:57:55.708 --> 00:57:56.428]  They admit that.
[00:57:57.748 --> 00:58:03.830]  I don't know if the converter boxes do, because the converter boxes are not two-way, so I would imagine they don't.
[00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:13.952]  It's a cable box, or a TiVo, two-way systems that are surveilling what you watch and what you do, and many of the models physically watching you and surveilling you.
[00:58:13.992 --> 00:58:14.852]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:14.872 --> 00:58:15.812]  Good to hear from you, Ken.
[00:58:16.153 --> 00:58:17.993]  Dan, Kurt, Greg, Mike, and many others.
[00:58:18.333 --> 00:58:19.453]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[00:58:19.493 --> 00:58:22.754]  In the fourth hour, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:24.735 --> 00:58:26.455]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:28.248 --> 00:58:31.812]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:33.294 --> 00:58:34.875]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:34.995 --> 00:58:39.580]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.483]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[00:58:42.704 --> 00:58:45.567]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:58:45.747 --> 00:58:50.452]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:58:50.672 --> 00:58:51.613]  If you simply prepare.
[00:58:51.814 --> 00:58:54.738]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:58:55.058 --> 00:59:01.947]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:02.047 --> 00:59:05.171]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:05.332 --> 00:59:05.592]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:07.995 --> 00:59:10.436]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:10.456 --> 00:59:16.540]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.482]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:20.502 --> 00:59:21.803]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:21.823 --> 00:59:22.423]  Take action today.
[00:59:22.463 --> 00:59:24.284]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:35.908 --> 00:59:37.831]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:38.312 --> 00:59:41.096]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:58.271]  We are back live, taking your phone calls.
[00:59:58.811 --> 00:59:59.692]  Kurt in Texas.
[01:00:00.533 --> 01:00:01.794]  No, next up is Dan in Texas.
[01:00:02.234 --> 01:00:04.155]  Dan in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:00:04.215 --> 01:00:04.616]  Go ahead.
[01:00:04.636 --> 01:00:07.218]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:12.902]  I'd like you to know that a lot of us couples listen to your show all the time.
[01:00:13.903 --> 01:00:18.747]  And my wife made an interesting comment, and I think I'm going to pass it on to you.
[01:00:19.508 --> 01:00:23.671]  She would like to see you have more women that are involved
[01:00:24.392 --> 01:00:29.336]  And the Patriot Movement and the Second Amendment Movement on your show as guests.
[01:00:30.477 --> 01:00:32.719]  That's just a hint she wanted to pass along.
[01:00:34.121 --> 01:00:42.748]  I want to make a comment, since our son is a police officer, that we hear a lot on the talk shows that they're downing the cops.
[01:00:42.828 --> 01:00:43.629]  Downing the cops.
[01:00:43.709 --> 01:00:44.750]  Cops are murderers.
[01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.971]  Cops are out of control.
[01:00:46.031 --> 01:00:47.392]  Cops, cops, cops, you know.
[01:00:48.573 --> 01:00:51.496]  I would like to see more radio personalities take
[01:00:52.014 --> 01:00:56.195]  The information they're getting about the bad cops and direct it that way.
[01:00:56.895 --> 01:01:05.298]  And please, those of you that are listening out there, don't imagine that every cop pulls you over is going to be out of control or one of the bad guys.
[01:01:06.158 --> 01:01:15.781]  We're a patriot family, and my son is a patriot, and he treats people with kindness and respect and so forth, and I would just hate for somebody to jump out of a car
[01:01:16.607 --> 01:01:23.498]  And blow him away or, you know, whether by gun or by their mouth, you know, because of their belief, you know, or feelings.
[01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:24.199]  Let me just say this.
[01:01:24.239 --> 01:01:25.000]  Let me just say this.
[01:01:27.423 --> 01:01:34.348]  They've got police so scared now that I saw two cases this week that I didn't even cover on air, if you thought I was trying to bash police.
[01:01:35.008 --> 01:01:39.671]  Where they pull over unarmed cars, the cops just get out and unload into the car, shooting people.
[01:01:40.372 --> 01:01:43.834]  Or they shoot somebody in the back and then say that... I mean, what about us?
[01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:44.714]  We're scared!
[01:01:44.955 --> 01:01:46.055]  We're tired of being killed.
[01:01:46.075 --> 01:01:47.416]  Am I saying all the police are bad?
[01:01:47.436 --> 01:01:47.476]  No!
[01:01:48.777 --> 01:01:52.059]  But all over Texas, the police pull you over and say, I want your watch.
[01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:53.139]  Give it to me.
[01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:57.541]  And the person takes their watch off and, okay, here's my watch.
[01:01:58.242 --> 01:02:02.484]  I mean, I just read the San Antonio Express News, one little town where they're stealing everybody's stuff.
[01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:07.166]  I mean, so what I'm saying is, the leadership of the police is bad.
[01:02:07.846 --> 01:02:14.790]  The feds have, I mean, I just covered Art Acevedo wanting everybody that gets arrested for a misdemeanor to have their blood taken in a DNA database.
[01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.511]  And the feds are telling him to do that.
[01:02:17.628 --> 01:02:23.414]  Now I know a lot of police, and a lot of police send us information, and I know a lot of police are nice, and I run into them.
[01:02:24.535 --> 01:02:25.396]  I understand that.
[01:02:25.857 --> 01:02:31.382]  But police are so scared of getting blown away, statistically they have a much better chance of being run over or down in a car wreck.
[01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:35.247]  They'll see them hanging their hind ends out on the highway writing tickets all day.
[01:02:36.768 --> 01:02:39.010]  My whole point is we have a predatory criminal government.
[01:02:39.711 --> 01:02:43.893]  And tyranny is going to come to your door in a uniform, as Officer Jack McClam says.
[01:02:43.933 --> 01:02:45.594]  So I salute good officers.
[01:02:45.634 --> 01:02:47.195]  I see police out changing tires.
[01:02:47.255 --> 01:02:48.776]  I see police out helping.
[01:02:48.796 --> 01:02:50.036]  And when they do good, I say it.
[01:02:50.276 --> 01:02:52.778]  And I always say it's not individuals, it's the system.
[01:02:53.078 --> 01:02:55.079]  But I mean, sir, we're in tyranny.
[01:02:55.559 --> 01:02:56.960]  In Germany, the police were bad.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.240]  In Russia, the police were bad.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.781]  In China, the police are bad.
[01:03:00.101 --> 01:03:04.604]  I mean, do you understand that when you have a bad government, the police, by extension, become that enforcer?
[01:03:06.444 --> 01:03:07.425]  Yes, I understand.
[01:03:08.442 --> 01:03:19.004]  But I just want to thank God that our son is not that way, and that, you know, people he pulls over up here will be treated with respect, and he is by the Constitution.
[01:03:19.784 --> 01:03:22.585]  Also, Alex, I'd like to say one more thing, and I get off here.
[01:03:22.605 --> 01:03:28.386]  I do praise you for your work on the show, and I'm not judging you as such on that particular subject.
[01:03:28.446 --> 01:03:34.147]  I'm just saying a lot of people do judge police officers, as all of them are bad.
[01:03:34.247 --> 01:03:35.047]  No, sir, they're not.
[01:03:35.428 --> 01:03:37.308]  I disagree with that with these people.
[01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:38.891]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:43.034]  I agree with you, but sir, a lot of people are in denial and saying none of them are bad.
[01:03:45.276 --> 01:03:46.357]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[01:03:47.398 --> 01:03:57.105]  Yes, we know there are some bad, because I saw the news story like you, and a cop pulls a gun, shoots a guy in the back, and he was down on the ground, and there was nothing he was doing to resist or anything.
[01:03:57.145 --> 01:04:05.352]  Yes, there are bad cops, but I'm just saying I would like for the public to remember that there are good cops, too, and when we
[01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:08.670]  Get on these stories about the bad cops and stuff.
[01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:14.558]  Let's direct it toward the bad cops and let's do remind the public, you know, there are good cops.
[01:04:14.638 --> 01:04:16.740]  Let us thank God for the good cops.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:17.061]  Let us.
[01:04:17.665 --> 01:04:19.546]  Pray for the good cops as well.
[01:04:19.927 --> 01:04:20.387]  Now, I hear you.
[01:04:20.427 --> 01:04:24.830]  Hey, Bob Dacey's son is a police officer, and he's a great guy.
[01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:25.851]  I remember when he was a little kid.
[01:04:25.871 --> 01:04:27.212]  That's how old I'm getting.
[01:04:27.232 --> 01:04:29.434]  I mean, he's a good guy.
[01:04:29.854 --> 01:04:32.236]  I'm telling you, though, the government is evil.
[01:04:32.756 --> 01:04:33.617]  It's gone bad.
[01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.860]  And so police need to realize that and say, OK, we're not with this system.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.300]  Good.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.181]  They can join us like the state houses are.
[01:04:40.562 --> 01:04:42.103]  Hey, I appreciate you and your family.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.222]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:04:47.363 --> 01:04:52.586]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:04:52.766 --> 01:04:57.530]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:09.038]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:14.982]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:21.267]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:21.467 --> 01:05:22.127]  What about you?
[01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:28.552]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:05:43.245 --> 01:05:49.651]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:50.011 --> 01:05:51.673]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:53.669]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.690]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.971]  This is his M.O.
[01:05:55.991 --> 01:05:57.293]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:58.994]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:06.101]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:06.502 --> 01:06:06.942]  Some U.S.
[01:06:06.982 --> 01:06:12.668]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:13.328 --> 01:06:16.791]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:16.811 --> 01:06:18.973]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:45.432]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:06:45.732 --> 01:06:46.872]  eFoods does it again.
[01:06:47.113 --> 01:06:51.893]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[01:06:52.213 --> 01:07:00.355]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:08.516]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[01:07:08.916 --> 01:07:11.717]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency,
[01:07:12.145 --> 01:07:15.508]  The Food and the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[01:07:15.968 --> 01:07:17.429]  Food is an everyday need.
[01:07:18.009 --> 01:07:23.133]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about.
[01:07:23.614 --> 01:07:25.655]  The 3-Day Responder, $21.95.
[01:07:27.036 --> 01:07:30.238]  Sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[01:07:30.599 --> 01:07:33.301]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:35.542]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:43.739 --> 01:07:49.361]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:59.426]  I want to say this to Dan, who called about his son being a police officer and being a patriot.
[01:08:01.887 --> 01:08:12.211]  I am not perfect, in fact I'm far from it, and I have said many times on air and I've apologized for the fact that I've actually helped the New World Order inadvertently
[01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:16.311]  Because the police are in a gang mentality.
[01:08:16.672 --> 01:08:19.195]  It's an us against them, you know, everybody's out to get them.
[01:08:20.236 --> 01:08:21.657]  All they can trust is fellow cops.
[01:08:22.118 --> 01:08:22.999]  That's what they're taught.
[01:08:23.639 --> 01:08:32.089]  And so when I come out and yell and scream and hyperventilate at the police, that actually helps them get into more of a paranoid mode, more into going along with tyranny.
[01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:39.225]  But at the same time, police are doing unconstitutional things all over the nation.
[01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:41.887]  They are basically under a federal directive.
[01:08:42.687 --> 01:08:44.208]  FEMA camps are being built.
[01:08:44.989 --> 01:08:47.670]  The police more and more do act like thugs.
[01:08:48.871 --> 01:08:51.793]  I mean, you know, I've been all over the country and asked a cop for directions.
[01:08:52.053 --> 01:08:55.936]  In Galveston, Texas, in New York City, they're like, do I look like a phone book to you?
[01:08:56.456 --> 01:08:58.177]  Like, hi officer, hey, do you know where this is?
[01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:01.059]  Do I look like a phone book to you?
[01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:05.909]  I've talked to a lot of Austin cops who visited New York, and they'll say, hey officer, where's this?
[01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.091]  Hey, what's your problem here?
[01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:09.292]  Get out of here!
[01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.814]  I talked to the Austin police chief out there.
[01:09:11.834 --> 01:09:14.036]  That happened to him in New York a few months ago, he said.
[01:09:15.237 --> 01:09:17.119]  So how do you like being treated like that?
[01:09:17.339 --> 01:09:18.180]  But it's more than that.
[01:09:19.033 --> 01:09:24.036]  I've had police in Austin, New York, other places walk up and say, turn your cameras off on the street corner.
[01:09:24.056 --> 01:09:26.217]  You're not allowed to be out here interviewing people.
[01:09:26.237 --> 01:09:27.258]  I go, but I have a First Amendment.
[01:09:28.099 --> 01:09:28.479]  Hey!
[01:09:28.699 --> 01:09:32.161]  You want me to arrest you right now, Mr. Smartpants?
[01:09:33.122 --> 01:09:35.083]  And you gotta go, okay, but I'm gonna sue you for this.
[01:09:35.623 --> 01:09:37.964]  Please don't violate the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:38.785]  Treat me like a human.
[01:09:39.605 --> 01:09:45.049]  They'll start screaming some more, then they'll get ready to arrest you, and then the supervisor comes over and doesn't want trouble and says, let him go.
[01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:49.582]  Now, I know they're training the police to dislike the public.
[01:09:49.682 --> 01:09:51.423]  I know they're training the police to feed on the public.
[01:09:51.743 --> 01:09:55.664]  And I know that every major jurisdiction we look at frames people all day long.
[01:09:56.105 --> 01:10:01.166]  I know the majority of narcotics officers are really drug dealers and plant drugs on people, and that's on record.
[01:10:01.486 --> 01:10:03.627]  I know the CIA ships in heroin and cocaine.
[01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:05.808]  I know that war on drugs is a fraud.
[01:10:05.908 --> 01:10:08.229]  I know all over Texas the police steal everything you got.
[01:10:09.884 --> 01:10:12.767]  It's normally smaller jurisdictions where total corruption takes over.
[01:10:13.048 --> 01:10:17.713]  The bigger ones just carry out the overall tyranny, but they know to keep the low-level crime down by their officers.
[01:10:18.353 --> 01:10:19.955]  Now, are all officers involved in this?
[01:10:20.075 --> 01:10:20.356]  No!
[01:10:22.838 --> 01:10:26.462]  I mean, I remember when I was in high school and college, I was big into working out.
[01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:27.423]  Worked out two hours a day.
[01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:28.244]  Wish I had the time today.
[01:10:28.973 --> 01:10:29.574]  You know, nowadays.
[01:10:29.994 --> 01:10:43.890]  And I worked out at gyms, and it was always cops who were in there, and, you know, they'd give me spots, and, you know, I remember being like 18 years old, and going, hey, we're going to get something to eat, and going to a restaurant, eating something with cops, military people, you know, because I look like that type of person, and I know they're just regular people.
[01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:52.815]  But the point is, they have been incrementally trained to urinate all over the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and I'm not putting up with it.
[01:10:53.055 --> 01:10:55.376]  You think the Founding Fathers hated all the redcoats?
[01:10:55.396 --> 01:10:56.856]  A lot of them have been redcoats.
[01:10:57.576 --> 01:10:58.596]  Been in the British military.
[01:10:58.716 --> 01:10:59.196]  Most of them.
[01:11:00.237 --> 01:11:01.837]  Yeah, including George Washington.
[01:11:02.737 --> 01:11:03.958]  They were tired of it.
[01:11:04.658 --> 01:11:05.198]  Look, look, look.
[01:11:06.309 --> 01:11:16.475]  I've been there and watched the APD grab a baby out of somebody's arms with no due process for no reason because it was a poor family and they knew they could steal it with a CPS and get $400,000 for it on the market.
[01:11:19.443 --> 01:11:26.705]  I've seen Judge Gene Mirra with the family courts threaten parents to sign their kids over to the government for being late to class three times when it's not even a violation of state law.
[01:11:27.285 --> 01:11:28.406]  The truancy law, they're claiming.
[01:11:28.986 --> 01:11:29.806]  I have seen it!
[01:11:30.466 --> 01:11:34.667]  I've gone out in my car after watching them steal babies and broke down and cried like a baby.
[01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.788]  It's torn my intestines out.
[01:11:38.157 --> 01:11:40.460]  I'm sick of injustice and I'm sick of the bull.
[01:11:41.342 --> 01:11:46.449]  And so overall, I'm tired of the TV ads worshiping the police and the military.
[01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:53.560]  That's not to worship the police and the military, it's to worship the government and to sell PR because they know the public's getting sick of it.
[01:11:55.185 --> 01:11:59.449]  Police were, in most areas of the society, revered and appreciated.
[01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:00.190]  And you know why?
[01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.651]  Fifty, a hundred years ago?
[01:12:01.691 --> 01:12:05.995]  Because they had to go after people when somebody stole somebody's goods.
[01:12:06.516 --> 01:12:07.997]  They had to go up against real criminals.
[01:12:08.017 --> 01:12:09.739]  They had to be in shootouts and hideouts.
[01:12:10.139 --> 01:12:11.720]  They had to go after bank robbers.
[01:12:12.501 --> 01:12:14.202]  And cops were into being macho and tough.
[01:12:14.262 --> 01:12:17.825]  There was still always corruption because you're going to have criminals trying to buy off the police.
[01:12:18.366 --> 01:12:26.532]  But by and large, that's why people didn't buy cops slices of apple pie and run out and give them coffee in their cars 50, 60 years ago because they were scared of them.
[01:12:26.772 --> 01:12:27.693]  They liked them.
[01:12:27.993 --> 01:12:28.554]  They knew them.
[01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:29.835]  They were on their local beat.
[01:12:30.255 --> 01:12:31.556]  And they were watching the neighborhood.
[01:12:31.816 --> 01:12:38.662]  And you could go out of town and know that Bob was going to be walking around with his partner and he knew the community.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.340]  That we don't have that now.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.041]  They don't want the police to know us.
[01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:45.181]  They don't want the police to be our friends.
[01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:46.902]  And I'm tired of it!
[01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.383]  Look, I'm going to explain something to the police and the military.
[01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:55.544]  I don't have time to kiss your butts.
[01:12:56.424 --> 01:12:58.425]  I don't have time to sit here and play games.
[01:12:59.265 --> 01:13:01.125]  They're going to steal all your pension funds.
[01:13:01.145 --> 01:13:02.926]  If you don't care about us, care about yourselves.
[01:13:03.606 --> 01:13:05.406]  They don't tell you not to drink fluoride water.
[01:13:05.426 --> 01:13:07.087]  They don't tell you not to drink aspartame cokes.
[01:13:07.427 --> 01:13:08.107]  They don't tell you
[01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.685]  How dangerous things are for you and your family?
[01:13:12.165 --> 01:13:12.666]  I do!
[01:13:13.186 --> 01:13:14.006]  I am your friend.
[01:13:14.106 --> 01:13:15.307]  I want you to do well in life.
[01:13:15.587 --> 01:13:17.488]  I don't want you to get shot out there on the streets.
[01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:24.533]  But I've seen cops time after time all over the country raid people and say they had an arsenal of guns.
[01:13:24.593 --> 01:13:26.053]  Some old man steal their guns.
[01:13:26.414 --> 01:13:27.914]  I've seen too much crime from you.
[01:13:28.295 --> 01:13:32.757]  I know statistically that you're doing a lot of bad.
[01:13:34.898 --> 01:13:37.120]  You know, there was a time in this nation where per capita
[01:13:39.639 --> 01:13:42.083]  We had a lot less police per population.
[01:13:42.904 --> 01:13:52.518]  But when a car got stolen, or when somebody got raped, the police went absolutely crazy like a bunch of bloodhounds on a scent.
[01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:54.549]  Now they don't do that.
[01:13:55.329 --> 01:13:56.430]  They do if a cop gets killed.
[01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:59.990]  You know over ninety percent of the time when a cop gets killed they find the perpetrator?
[01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:06.292]  Did you know only ten or eleven, depending on the year, percent of murders go solved if it's a civilian?
[01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:08.172]  Why are you using military terminology?
[01:14:08.452 --> 01:14:09.232]  You don't know why.
[01:14:09.552 --> 01:14:10.453]  You need to find out.
[01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:13.373]  Police.
[01:14:14.133 --> 01:14:16.234]  Why is the mayor calling people in Austin civilians?
[01:14:16.254 --> 01:14:19.214]  I'm not going to call him a jackass.
[01:14:19.694 --> 01:14:20.915]  He, I guess I just did, he
[01:14:22.668 --> 01:14:23.508]  Knows what he's doing.
[01:14:24.488 --> 01:14:30.970]  The cities are nothing but systems to scoop up all the tax money and send it offshore through the comprehensive financial reports.
[01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:33.370]  The government's much more corrupt than you know.
[01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:34.570]  You work for it!
[01:14:36.831 --> 01:14:46.833]  So, we praise the police like Officer Jack McClam and... Let's get Officer Jack McClam back on.
[01:14:46.893 --> 01:14:47.593]  Write a note, please.
[01:14:47.713 --> 01:14:49.854]  And I want to get Sheriff Richard Mack on.
[01:14:49.894 --> 01:14:51.054]  It's been years since I had him on.
[01:14:52.193 --> 01:14:58.655]  You know, he didn't like how the Feds were pulling people over for having handguns, doctors and lawyers, people with no criminal records, and taking them to jail in his county.
[01:14:59.215 --> 01:15:04.276]  So, he sued them, went to the Supreme Court, and won a Second Amendment case on the Tenth Amendment.
[01:15:04.536 --> 01:15:08.617]  The Feds don't have any jurisdiction in the states.
[01:15:08.677 --> 01:15:10.838]  The states are supposed to have any gun laws if they're going to have them.
[01:15:12.238 --> 01:15:15.019]  The only gun law this country ever had was, you've got to have them openly.
[01:15:15.659 --> 01:15:16.619]  See, that's the legal trick.
[01:15:16.639 --> 01:15:19.520]  They say, well, to have them concealed, you've got to get a permit.
[01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:22.200]  Because that's against the law under the Constitution.
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.902]  You have arms openly.
[01:15:24.822 --> 01:15:26.985]  Why do you shake hands with somebody?
[01:15:27.325 --> 01:15:30.388]  That's the old, ancient, medieval thing of, hey, let's shake hands.
[01:15:30.488 --> 01:15:31.289]  I don't have an arm.
[01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:32.691]  I'm meeting you on the highway.
[01:15:33.712 --> 01:15:35.493]  I'm going to shake hands with you.
[01:15:36.174 --> 01:15:42.661]  I'm not about here off the coach road to pull out a dagger and stab you in the stomach or pull out a musket and shoot you.
[01:15:45.933 --> 01:15:49.914]  You know, I see these national polls where 90 plus percent of police say they're pro-Second Amendment.
[01:15:50.494 --> 01:15:51.274]  Well, where are you?
[01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.595]  I see you carrying out unconstitutional actions.
[01:15:54.215 --> 01:15:56.676]  Look, foreign banks have seized the United States.
[01:15:56.696 --> 01:15:57.396]  I keep repeating that.
[01:15:57.716 --> 01:16:05.778]  We're in receivership, and if we could just wake up to that and get past the puppet Obama and the puppet Bush and all this window dressing and really get down to brass tacks, we could turn this around.
[01:16:06.098 --> 01:16:07.438]  If not, we don't have any future.
[01:16:07.638 --> 01:16:08.979]  Look, I'm right about all this stuff.
[01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:09.879]  We've proven we're right.
[01:16:12.313 --> 01:16:13.794]  I try to be friendly towards the police.
[01:16:13.834 --> 01:16:17.437]  I try to have Artie Cerveda in here twice because he's slick and he reaches out to people.
[01:16:17.477 --> 01:16:22.700]  But frankly, he's going up the federal ladder and doing stuff that's unbelievable.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:23.861]  DNA databases now.
[01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:29.145]  He is Artie Cerveda the vampire.
[01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:35.309]  I mean, he is out of control.
[01:16:37.475 --> 01:16:38.436]  And I know he listens.
[01:16:38.476 --> 01:16:40.337]  He tells me about half my shows.
[01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:43.899]  Well, I mean, you know, I'm going to take him up on going out to dinner sometime when I get time.
[01:16:43.939 --> 01:16:44.839]  He lives in the same neighborhood as me.
[01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.182]  I'm going to just say, you know, when does it end?
[01:16:49.222 --> 01:16:55.946]  And his excuse is, well, DNA actually, you know, we take DNA from all the misdemeanor people.
[01:16:55.966 --> 01:16:59.268]  You know, DNA has gotten all these people off death row.
[01:16:59.408 --> 01:17:00.029]  Exactly.
[01:17:00.609 --> 01:17:03.651]  Over a third of people on death row, it's been found, are totally innocent.
[01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:08.131]  But they don't want the DNA.
[01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:08.892]  The Feds don't.
[01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:10.635]  Pushing this nationwide and worldwide.
[01:17:10.655 --> 01:17:11.476]  The British have already got it.
[01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:15.822]  They want it so they have your blood sample so they can frame you with it.
[01:17:15.843 --> 01:17:17.886]  Do I have to go through how they frame you with your blood samples?
[01:17:20.765 --> 01:17:25.928]  Oh, but he says it's to make sure you're safe and to make sure that they can test the DNA properly.
[01:17:26.168 --> 01:17:27.949]  But you can't trust the system that does it.
[01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:29.229]  You know, I'm for the death penalty.
[01:17:29.269 --> 01:17:31.231]  I believe some child rapist needs to be executed.
[01:17:31.831 --> 01:17:32.551]  Some child killer.
[01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:37.614]  But you can't trust a criminal state because they've been proven, they framed so many people.
[01:17:38.034 --> 01:17:44.998]  That's not why Art Acevedo and six other Texas police chiefs are pushing for taking your blood every time you're arrested for misdemeanors and felonies.
[01:17:46.391 --> 01:17:48.412]  They're doing this as part of a global operation!
[01:17:48.913 --> 01:17:52.435]  I told people years ago they'd propose that, and now it's happening right here where I live!
[01:17:54.597 --> 01:17:55.317]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:17:58.039 --> 01:17:59.460]  Curtin, Texas, you're on the air.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.481]  Uh, hello.
[01:18:02.082 --> 01:18:02.342]  Hi.
[01:18:02.482 --> 01:18:08.546]  I dropped out of the NRA when I learned that they were an NGO of the UN.
[01:18:10.067 --> 01:18:10.227]  Yep.
[01:18:10.267 --> 01:18:15.551]  I didn't figure that they could be of any good being connected with that organization.
[01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:20.195]  Well, they sponsored the 1968 Gun Control Act and the 1933 one.
[01:18:20.235 --> 01:18:21.716]  They are behind all the gun control.
[01:18:25.018 --> 01:18:31.522]  I distribute quite a few copies of your film out to people.
[01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:40.247]  Have you heard of anybody else that has been more or less what a friend of mine called black-bagged?
[01:18:42.248 --> 01:18:44.010]  Back several weeks ago,
[01:18:46.343 --> 01:18:51.346]  When me and the wife came in, we detected that somebody had been in the house, maybe.
[01:18:52.567 --> 01:19:15.042]  Uh, there didn't seem to be anything missing or disturbed too much, and, uh, I thought it was just our imagination until I, uh, looked at, uh, the original copies of your DVDs, and every last one of them, it looked like somebody had took sandpaper
[01:19:15.632 --> 01:19:17.514]  It went from one side to the other, Alan.
[01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:18.595]  Stay there!
[01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:21.097]  I'll tell you what's going on when we get back.
[01:19:22.738 --> 01:19:24.360]  That is how afraid of these films.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:28.043]  When I tell you these films are the solution, I'm not kidding.
[01:19:29.625 --> 01:19:39.333]  They have arrested people in Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, Michigan, and California for handing my videos out.
[01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:40.855]  And Ron Paul videos.
[01:19:43.493 --> 01:19:46.756]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:50.999]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:19:51.179 --> 01:20:02.607]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:20:02.848 --> 01:20:08.672]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:20:08.952 --> 01:20:09.212]  I'm good.
[01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:35.691]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:37.211]  And we knew what to do.
[01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.252]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:20:38.312 --> 01:20:41.954]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:20:41.974 --> 01:20:42.254]  Whitman, EPA.
[01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:08.115]  The director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:21:08.456 --> 01:21:15.262]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:21:15.562 --> 01:21:18.605]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:21:18.725 --> 01:21:23.970]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:21:24.491 --> 01:21:27.033]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:21:27.552 --> 01:21:33.421]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:21:33.621 --> 01:21:36.165]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:21:36.545 --> 01:21:41.453]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:49.059]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:49.519 --> 01:21:57.282]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:57.643 --> 01:22:03.205]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:22:03.556 --> 01:22:05.497]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:10.560]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:15.603]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:16.123 --> 01:22:19.966]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:20.466 --> 01:22:21.467]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.547 --> 01:22:25.629]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.486]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:22:41.451 --> 01:22:45.833]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:22:45.893 --> 01:22:51.537]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:22:51.637 --> 01:22:55.619]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:58.241]  Nature's Gem Premium Omega-3.
[01:22:58.421 --> 01:23:09.648]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.
[01:23:09.788 --> 01:23:17.953]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight, keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of Omega-3.
[01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:21.675]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[01:23:21.855 --> 01:23:23.737]  Nature's Jam Golden Flax is pure.

[01:23:36.105 --> 01:23:36.285]  That's 800-387-5516.
[01:23:36.325 --> 01:23:37.006]  Free shipping included.
[01:23:53.145 --> 01:24:01.352]  Okay, we are going back to Kurt in Texas.
[01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.813]  Kurt, just some background.
[01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:07.397]  Let me guess, you live in a small town?
[01:24:09.138 --> 01:24:10.640]  Not too small a town.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:11.881]  Where do you live?
[01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:12.781]  Abilene.
[01:24:13.795 --> 01:24:16.096]  Oh, Abilene is probably one of the worst.
[01:24:16.756 --> 01:24:19.397]  You know, that's where the Bushies hang out, that and Midland.
[01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:23.559]  We see some of the worst cases in that area time and time again.
[01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:31.042]  And what happens is, people that give out hundreds or thousands of copies, and this has ended up in the newspaper,
[01:24:31.724 --> 01:24:34.086]  I don't know if you've heard me tell the Kelly Rushing case.
[01:24:34.126 --> 01:24:41.254]  He was giving out my video and a Ron Paul video and they charged him for my video and the Ron Paul video saying it was threatening to police that they didn't like it.
[01:24:41.814 --> 01:24:45.798]  And it went to court and the jury found him not guilty of terroristic threats through the videos.
[01:24:46.279 --> 01:24:49.802]  Very nice guy in the community and he couldn't believe that it happened.
[01:24:50.683 --> 01:24:53.966]  But yes, they probably went in your house looking for something illegal.
[01:24:54.767 --> 01:24:56.948]  They couldn't find anything and they got mad.
[01:24:56.988 --> 01:25:01.871]  And see, you've got these federally paid for anti-terror liaison officers in every department.
[01:25:02.191 --> 01:25:03.392]  A lot of them in big departments.
[01:25:04.252 --> 01:25:04.992]  They have nothing to do.
[01:25:05.653 --> 01:25:06.773]  There are no real terrorists.
[01:25:06.913 --> 01:25:13.657]  But, like the Federal Marshal said last year, in the case of airports, a little kid taking a picture with a camera, they're on the terror list for life.
[01:25:15.078 --> 01:25:15.418]  Anything.
[01:25:16.018 --> 01:25:18.439]  Order a different meal on the plane, terror list for life.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.921]  They said, this is wrong, but we have to show there's a terror threat.
[01:25:22.442 --> 01:25:22.642]  So,
[01:25:24.168 --> 01:25:27.912]  These guys don't like the fact you're handing videos out in town.
[01:25:28.232 --> 01:25:29.273]  Have you handed a lot out?
[01:25:30.775 --> 01:25:30.975]  Yes.
[01:25:31.976 --> 01:25:32.336]  How many?
[01:25:34.619 --> 01:25:36.000]  I don't know.
[01:25:36.981 --> 01:25:38.062]  Ballpark, ballpark.
[01:25:38.943 --> 01:25:40.765]  Around 300, 400.
[01:25:42.587 --> 01:25:45.830]  Well, the answer is you just hand out even more.
[01:25:50.889 --> 01:25:53.751]  Look, it's just secret police intimidation, and it's going to get worse.
[01:25:54.872 --> 01:25:57.794]  You know, I've had all sorts of stuff done to me, and you know, these are criminals.
[01:25:58.874 --> 01:26:02.977]  And, uh, it's disgusting.
[01:26:03.037 --> 01:26:04.538]  I mean, what, were you out of town when this happened?
[01:26:05.519 --> 01:26:06.339]  Uh, no.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:14.144]  I was just out one day around town, spent most of the day, and it was late in the evening when I came in.
[01:26:14.164 --> 01:26:18.367]  And, uh, I questioned my neighbors.
[01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:19.988]  Of course, nobody saw anything.
[01:26:21.283 --> 01:26:35.049]  But I was lucky enough when the Hastings local video buffed them up for me, got the scratches out where they all run just as true as can be, thank goodness.
[01:26:37.069 --> 01:26:50.415]  But just looked like they'd taken each one out, the master copies and some of the ones I had sitting in folders ready to go out and took sandpaper or a key or something.
[01:26:50.894 --> 01:26:52.696]  Just went back and forth across the country.
[01:26:53.256 --> 01:26:55.358]  What does that tell you the films are doing?
[01:26:57.099 --> 01:26:59.962]  It tells us someone don't want them seen.
[01:27:01.083 --> 01:27:05.346]  Because they're afraid of especially Texans and people that have a history of fighting back.
[01:27:06.307 --> 01:27:09.129]  They know conservatives especially and libertarians are upset.
[01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:11.291]  They don't want people knowing the full story.
[01:27:12.152 --> 01:27:15.675]  Because if folks find out the true diabolical nature, but it's too late.
[01:27:15.695 --> 01:27:17.817]  I want to tell the thugs that did this, it's too late for you.
[01:27:19.011 --> 01:27:21.233]  Ten states are moving to stand against you.
[01:27:21.293 --> 01:27:22.093]  More will move.
[01:27:23.835 --> 01:27:25.896]  We are going to win this thing with God's help, my friend.
[01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:44.670]  The state of Texas has always had the right to secede from the Union, and if it comes to that right now, that would be the ideal thing for us to do.
[01:27:45.623 --> 01:27:46.704]  It's not a union anymore.
[01:27:46.784 --> 01:27:48.685]  It's been hijacked publicly.
[01:27:48.705 --> 01:27:50.446]  We're under war powers by foreign banks.
[01:27:50.506 --> 01:27:51.466]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:52.607 --> 01:27:53.927]  Just keep making the copies.
[01:27:53.987 --> 01:27:55.248]  Keep getting them out to people.
[01:27:55.328 --> 01:27:56.409]  Intensify your efforts.
[01:27:56.449 --> 01:27:57.349]  Get with more people.
[01:27:58.109 --> 01:28:00.691]  Every time you get attacked, say, I put it in God's hands.
[01:28:00.771 --> 01:28:01.851]  I expand what I'm doing.
[01:28:03.132 --> 01:28:05.473]  You know when you're over the target when you're getting the flack.
[01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:07.514]  Let's talk to Greg in New York.
[01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:08.395]  Greg, you're on the air.
[01:28:08.755 --> 01:28:09.575]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:28:09.876 --> 01:28:11.196]  I've got a quick question for you, sir.
[01:28:11.236 --> 01:28:12.837]  I just got a letter from the U.S.
[01:28:12.857 --> 01:28:14.298]  Department of Justice and FBI.
[01:28:15.257 --> 01:28:17.238]  I live up here in a small town in upstate New York.
[01:28:17.418 --> 01:28:19.018]  I have my hunting license.
[01:28:19.178 --> 01:28:19.879]  We hunt deer.
[01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:20.599]  We fish.
[01:28:20.619 --> 01:28:21.219]  We do whatever.
[01:28:21.239 --> 01:28:26.681]  I went to a local gun shop out here in the middle of nowhere to buy a new Mossberg shotgun.
[01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:29.042]  And I had to fill out a form for the FBI.
[01:28:29.142 --> 01:28:29.862]  No big deal.
[01:28:29.882 --> 01:28:31.082]  I had a DUI back in 1980s.
[01:28:31.122 --> 01:28:33.443]  I guess I was 50 years old.
[01:28:33.463 --> 01:28:35.204]  I was 20-some years ago.
[01:28:35.504 --> 01:28:39.405]  And I got turned down because of an NICS check.
[01:28:39.929 --> 01:28:40.129]  Yep!
[01:28:40.749 --> 01:28:41.990]  They are now... I can't believe it!
[01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:57.016]  I'm sorry, Alex, but what it says is your denial indicates that either you or another individual with a similar name and or similar descriptive features has been matched for the following federally prohibitive criteria under Title 18.
[01:28:57.096 --> 01:28:59.617]  Alex, I gave them my fingerprints.
[01:28:59.697 --> 01:29:00.497]  I had sent it in.
[01:29:00.517 --> 01:29:02.798]  They had my driver's license and my social security number.
[01:29:03.467 --> 01:29:05.529]  What type of a profile are they talking about?
[01:29:24.864 --> 01:29:30.109]  I mean, I know so many veterans, so many retired cops, famous football players, they can't own guns now.
[01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:31.991]  They have no convictions, doesn't matter.
[01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:33.072]  The feds just laugh.
[01:29:33.273 --> 01:29:36.556]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:40.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:43.442 --> 01:29:46.125]  Every 23 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[01:29:46.486 --> 01:29:48.888]  Rapes, robberies, carjackings, assaults.
[01:29:49.309 --> 01:29:53.433]  You can find statistics all day long and tell yourself it probably won't happen to you.
[01:29:53.874 --> 01:29:57.378]  But those statistics won't mean anything if you become a victim.
[01:29:57.858 --> 01:29:58.439]  It's been said
[01:29:58.439 --> 01:29:58.999]  We're good to go.

[01:30:43.311 --> 01:30:49.695]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:50.055 --> 01:30:52.036]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:53.737]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:54.258 --> 01:30:54.758]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:55.979]  This is his ammo.
[01:30:56.019 --> 01:30:57.400]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.101]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:06.165]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:06.565 --> 01:31:07.005]  Some U.S.
[01:31:07.045 --> 01:31:12.689]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:13.389 --> 01:31:16.870]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:19.691]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:43.354 --> 01:31:47.656]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:31:47.876 --> 01:31:52.798]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:52.978 --> 01:31:54.319]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:54.499 --> 01:31:57.981]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:32:20.814 --> 01:32:22.395]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[01:32:54.855 --> 01:32:57.917]  Okay, I'm going to continue with your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:58.817 --> 01:33:00.278]  You know, I meant to go through this today.
[01:33:00.318 --> 01:33:02.059]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:02.099 --> 01:33:03.280]  It's on newsstands everywhere.
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.421]  We are all socialists now.
[01:33:05.922 --> 01:33:08.123]  In many ways, our economy already resembles a European one.
[01:33:09.164 --> 01:33:12.686]  As boomers age and spending grows, we will become even more French.
[01:33:14.227 --> 01:33:15.948]  Ah yes, Rothschild dominated.
[01:33:16.728 --> 01:33:20.411]  And then it goes into, now the United States is now socialist.
[01:33:21.411 --> 01:33:22.432]  And what a great thing it is.
[01:33:24.127 --> 01:33:36.861]  But it's not socialist, it's a parasitic government sitting on top of us, ruling over us, having their way with us.
[01:33:37.461 --> 01:33:40.985]  See, government's bankrupt, so it's answer is get even bigger and take over even more.
[01:33:42.567 --> 01:33:46.091]  And just one facet of the spending bill that passed the Senate, now it's going to go back to the House.
[01:33:49.136 --> 01:33:52.418]  Bloomberg reports, this is just so amazing, I covered a lot of it in the first hour.
[01:33:52.438 --> 01:33:53.478]  I think I read the whole article.
[01:33:54.078 --> 01:33:57.040]  When that restarts in about 25 minutes, you'll want to listen to it.
[01:33:59.341 --> 01:34:02.182]  This is currently in the bill to ration health care.
[01:34:02.202 --> 01:34:05.563]  It says, health care reform will not be pain-free.
[01:34:06.044 --> 01:34:08.845]  Senators should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age.
[01:34:09.325 --> 01:34:13.127]  Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them.
[01:34:14.485 --> 01:34:17.407]  You just don't get your stuff treated now under social health care.
[01:34:17.447 --> 01:34:17.907]  You like that?
[01:34:17.927 --> 01:34:20.469]  A year and a half, two years for a brain tumor to be worked on.
[01:34:20.869 --> 01:34:22.890]  Medicare now pays for treatments deemed safe and effective.
[01:34:23.211 --> 01:34:27.874]  The stimulus bill would change that and apply a cost-effectiveness standard set by the Federal Council.
[01:34:28.694 --> 01:34:32.437]  The Federal Council is modeled after the UK Board, discussed in Daschle's book.
[01:34:32.497 --> 01:34:36.899]  And it goes on to say, this is what they're saying, you'll have to go blind.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.601]  Old folks are supposed to go blind.
[01:34:38.961 --> 01:34:40.502]  You don't get that surgery.
[01:34:40.902 --> 01:34:42.003]  I mean, that's in the bill!
[01:34:43.902 --> 01:34:45.943]  We kept telling you people that wanted socialism.
[01:34:45.983 --> 01:34:47.324]  It's not even... it's eugenics!
[01:34:48.005 --> 01:34:51.587]  It's controlling the way you live and behavior.
[01:34:54.449 --> 01:34:56.150]  Well, we kept tabs on you your whole life.
[01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:57.631]  You were healthy.
[01:34:57.932 --> 01:34:58.752]  You're a good bureaucrat.
[01:34:58.772 --> 01:34:59.573]  You're part of the party.
[01:34:59.613 --> 01:35:00.333]  You get health care.
[01:35:02.715 --> 01:35:03.916]  Just unbelievable.
[01:35:03.936 --> 01:35:10.140]  You know, there's a bunch of other news I want to go to, but first let's take a few more calls before I do that.
[01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:12.381]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:35:13.971 --> 01:35:14.572]  Who's up next?
[01:35:14.632 --> 01:35:15.833]  Mike in Tennessee, or was it Greg?
[01:35:17.014 --> 01:35:17.914]  Yeah, it's Mike in Tennessee.
[01:35:17.934 --> 01:35:18.415]  You're on the air.
[01:35:18.435 --> 01:35:18.955]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:20.597]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:35:20.737 --> 01:35:27.883]  Yeah, I was listening to your guest earlier with the Gun Owners of America, and I was at the gun show in Germantown, Tennessee, Saturday.
[01:35:28.624 --> 01:35:31.466]  And there was an NRA booth, and I walked by, and I was reading their information.
[01:35:31.486 --> 01:35:33.588]  The guy asked if I was a member, and I said, no.
[01:35:33.668 --> 01:35:35.670]  And he says, well, why not?
[01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:37.211]  Don't you support the Second Amendment?
[01:35:37.271 --> 01:35:39.313]  And I said, yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.
[01:35:40.069 --> 01:35:59.353]  Because you're responsible for sponsoring the 1933 and 1968 gun bans, I kind of hold you guys responsible for that, and since you don't support the Second Amendment, it seems like you support mostly hunters, but not people with the Second Amendment being there for people to bear arms to protect themselves from a corrupt government.
[01:36:00.114 --> 01:36:02.734]  That's what you guys are missing, and I wish you'd get on board with us.
[01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:05.055]  Well, the guys started yelling at me.
[01:36:07.253 --> 01:36:12.014]  Basically, one of his friends next to him jumped up and said he was going to kick my tail, but he didn't say tail.
[01:36:12.074 --> 01:36:14.655]  Anyway, I thought that was quite interesting.
[01:36:14.695 --> 01:36:21.197]  Instead of them being able to debate the question about their sponsorship of these bills, they just went on the attack.
[01:36:21.217 --> 01:36:23.438]  I wish I'd had a recorder on me.
[01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:26.179]  Those guys are just making money there.
[01:36:27.539 --> 01:36:31.960]  I've had a lot of gun shop owners go, Alex, don't tell people the NICS is a registration.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:32.801]  It's not.
[01:36:32.841 --> 01:36:33.681]  It scares them away.
[01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:35.135]  Yeah.
[01:36:35.155 --> 01:36:36.876]  That's what it is, a registration.
[01:36:37.116 --> 01:36:39.937]  It's a registration, you're a gun owner, and how many guns you got.
[01:36:39.997 --> 01:36:43.598]  Is it a long arm, you know, a long rifle, shotgun, or handgun?
[01:36:46.179 --> 01:36:47.160]  Are you asking me a question?
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:53.762]  No, I mean, I'm telling... So, tell me, what happened when the guy said, I'm going to kick your butt?
[01:36:55.023 --> 01:37:02.526]  He told his buddy to go get the head of the organization who was running the show, and of course, I was the radio host in a simulcast the day before.
[01:37:02.566 --> 01:37:03.506]  He didn't recognize me.
[01:37:03.996 --> 01:37:05.977]  And so the guy comes over and says, what's the matter, Mike?
[01:37:06.017 --> 01:37:06.937]  And I told him what happened.
[01:37:06.977 --> 01:37:10.379]  And so, you know, I just mentioned the gun bans and there's two or three people listening.
[01:37:10.879 --> 01:37:15.762]  And I figured they would either debate me on the issue or they would, you know, not say anything.
[01:37:15.822 --> 01:37:19.944]  I didn't think they were going to attack me and threaten to, you know, jump over the counter and kick my butt as they did.
[01:37:20.444 --> 01:37:22.365]  He said, look, you know, don't listen to those guys.
[01:37:22.465 --> 01:37:23.606]  You know, I'm aware of the bans.
[01:37:23.626 --> 01:37:25.266]  I'm not a member either of the NRA.
[01:37:25.286 --> 01:37:27.468]  Just, you know, they're just paid sponsors.
[01:37:27.488 --> 01:37:28.548]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:37:28.728 --> 01:37:29.809]  I want to hear more of this.
[01:37:31.002 --> 01:37:34.143]  Notice their response was they didn't like your speech.
[01:37:34.263 --> 01:37:37.144]  They were going to use authority to stop you from speaking.
[01:37:37.545 --> 01:37:51.810]  Remember the articles in Missouri and other states where the state police went on TV and others and said, if you criticize Obama and tell a lie about him, we're going to arrest you and they decide what a lie is.
[01:37:53.231 --> 01:38:01.174]  Again, and then my listeners didn't believe that until I played the newscast, and the newscast was acting like it was normal and kosher.
[01:38:01.934 --> 01:38:03.735]  But I mean, see how their response?
[01:38:04.476 --> 01:38:06.196]  I had the same thing happen in McBride's.
[01:38:06.216 --> 01:38:06.997]  Nice gun shop.
[01:38:07.597 --> 01:38:09.898]  I know a lot of guys that work there, but the guy got aggressive.
[01:38:09.918 --> 01:38:11.158]  He said, Alex, I don't appreciate it.
[01:38:11.178 --> 01:38:12.139]  I wasn't there buying a shotgun.
[01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:15.680]  I don't appreciate you lying about Bush being for the assault weapons ban.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:16.780]  And I said, it is.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.061]  He's like, oh, it is, huh?
[01:38:18.281 --> 01:38:19.461]  Because it's their false paradigm.
[01:38:19.481 --> 01:38:20.582]  What are you, some kind of liberal?
[01:38:20.902 --> 01:38:22.763]  And then the manager came over and said, no, he's right.
[01:38:22.924 --> 01:38:23.464]  He's right.
[01:38:23.584 --> 01:38:24.285]  Alex is right.
[01:38:24.785 --> 01:38:25.846]  And the guy was like, who?
[01:38:26.466 --> 01:38:28.188]  But I mean, look at their response.
[01:38:28.588 --> 01:38:30.529]  I'm going to get you thrown out of here, boy.
[01:38:30.569 --> 01:38:32.851]  You don't tell me the NRA is a gun control group.
[01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:36.874]  Instead of him saying, show me proof, let's defend the Second Amendment.
[01:38:37.034 --> 01:38:41.778]  But I mean, so what did they do once they learned that you, thank God you were a talk show host, they might have SWAT teamed you.
[01:38:42.779 --> 01:38:43.239]  What happened?
[01:38:43.837 --> 01:38:52.524]  Well, he told me that I couldn't say that, and I said, you asked me a question, and of course I'm a free American with a First Amendment right, and I can say what I want.
[01:38:52.604 --> 01:38:56.827]  You don't have to like it, but it's the truth, and you can't stop me from saying it.
[01:38:56.847 --> 01:38:59.009]  And of course, that's when they blew up.
[01:38:59.029 --> 01:39:03.993]  Of course, they couldn't handle that, but I'm just trying to engage the guy on the conversation.
[01:39:04.433 --> 01:39:13.060]  He engaged me first, asking me why I wasn't a member, and I informed him why, and pointed out the reasons why, and challenged him to
[01:39:13.655 --> 01:39:16.436]  You know, correct their errors in their ways in the past.
[01:39:16.456 --> 01:39:27.538]  I said, if you guys would get on board with us, the Americans that are supporting the Second Amendment for what it was designed for, you know, we'll support you, but until you do, I have no interest in being a part of your affiliation.
[01:39:28.538 --> 01:39:30.398]  So... And what did he say then?
[01:39:31.719 --> 01:39:36.880]  Well, I mean, that's basically when the guy got hostile and the guy that looked like Jabba the Hutt, probably 450 pound guy,
[01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:42.773]  You know, he's the one that said he was going to break bad and jump over the table and attack me and kick my butt.
[01:39:42.793 --> 01:39:47.298]  Of course, I'm 6'5", about 200 pounds, and not really worried about the guy, to be honest with you.
[01:39:47.318 --> 01:39:59.570]  But it was interesting, his tactic, his attack on me that I had to shut up and leave, or they were going to kick my butt, and instead of discussing this civilly and maybe talking about their history,
[01:40:00.353 --> 01:40:01.574]  Oh no, I didn't want to do that.
[01:40:02.134 --> 01:40:05.375]  But see, notice he made the terroristic threat.
[01:40:05.535 --> 01:40:07.116]  I mean, that's punishable by jail time.
[01:40:07.716 --> 01:40:08.956]  I'm going to kick your butt.
[01:40:08.996 --> 01:40:09.937]  I'm going to physically assault you.
[01:40:09.957 --> 01:40:11.797]  I'm going to come over to this table and kick your ass.
[01:40:12.578 --> 01:40:18.000]  And then you're sitting there, and then they go call and try to tattletale.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.160]  Right, right.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:23.282]  The head of the sponsor, the people that were running the organization.
[01:40:24.249 --> 01:40:27.131]  You know, this fella, his thing is just to try to make pieces.
[01:40:27.332 --> 01:40:30.494]  Okay, Mike, just stay away from him and I'll tell him to stay away from you, blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:30.794 --> 01:40:38.541]  You know, I was going to get the guys to come on the simulcast and talk about what they're up to and, you know, that never happened.
[01:40:38.561 --> 01:40:39.281]  That wasn't in there.
[01:40:39.642 --> 01:40:50.511]  But the funny thing is, this is interesting, I went to, half of the people there that were gun dealers and vendors, none of them wanted to come on the radio because they were concerned about the government identifying them.
[01:40:50.976 --> 01:40:55.818]  Oh yeah, because they harass gun shops and gun dealers that stand up to the Second Amendment.
[01:40:55.858 --> 01:41:00.400]  We're living in a climate of intimidation, and I run into the BATF.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.461]  I mean, these guys look like real criminals.
[01:41:04.521 --> 01:41:06.342]  I mean, not guys trying to act like criminals.
[01:41:06.722 --> 01:41:11.204]  They were all about 6'2", muscular, shaved heads, goatees, tattoos, and they're just like...
[01:41:12.501 --> 01:41:13.321]  One last thing, Alex.
[01:41:13.341 --> 01:41:16.323]  My second show, I had a local gun shop spend $10 on a single ad before the election.
[01:41:38.806 --> 01:41:39.846]  The election is Tuesday.
[01:41:40.066 --> 01:41:40.747]  Today is Sunday.
[01:41:40.767 --> 01:41:41.427]  Tomorrow is Monday.
[01:41:41.447 --> 01:41:42.507]  The only gun shop open.
[01:41:42.567 --> 01:41:43.688]  I said the name of the gun shop.
[01:41:43.728 --> 01:41:45.188]  I said that three times in one minute.
[01:41:45.208 --> 01:41:46.749]  That was my slick ad.
[01:41:46.789 --> 01:41:47.269]  That was it.
[01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:53.111]  Monday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms visited this dealer and said, why are you advertising on this show?
[01:41:53.131 --> 01:41:56.653]  The area supervisor, the gun shop dealer, talked him at this show.
[01:41:56.673 --> 01:41:57.553]  I hadn't talked to him since.
[01:41:57.593 --> 01:41:58.533]  He finally revealed to me.
[01:41:59.034 --> 01:42:04.936]  The area supervisor for the BATF visited him and said, don't advertise anymore or we'll pull your plug.
[01:42:05.868 --> 01:42:06.731]  That's America!
[01:42:06.751 --> 01:42:12.227]  That's how... I mean folks, that is what we're... instead of that guy saying, you know what?
[01:42:13.626 --> 01:42:18.429]  Well, no, you don't want to tell them then, or the BATF would have planted a hand grenade.
[01:42:18.469 --> 01:42:19.389]  Oh, really?
[01:42:19.769 --> 01:42:21.190]  You know, probably blasted him right in the chest.
[01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:21.750]  I'm not kidding.
[01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:23.071]  I mean, they bombed Oklahoma City.
[01:42:23.111 --> 01:42:24.372]  It was the BATF that did that.
[01:42:25.292 --> 01:42:31.956]  We caught them red-handed, but the point here is, he should have gone public, he should have made a big stink out of it, and said, I'm being politically persecuted.
[01:42:31.976 --> 01:42:33.897]  Then they wouldn't get within 100 miles of him.
[01:42:34.937 --> 01:42:41.221]  But let me guess, the gun shop is going to live in the Soviet Union, they're going to do what they're told, and just wait to be shut down anyways.
[01:42:41.977 --> 01:42:44.879]  He is the last gun shop in the small town of Covington, Tennessee.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.541]  Bryant, Tennessee's got one.
[01:42:46.601 --> 01:42:47.641]  Millington's down to one.
[01:42:48.042 --> 01:42:52.105]  They're slowly... Mike's in Jackson, Tennessee, one of the largest and oldest, is gone.
[01:42:52.185 --> 01:42:53.086]  They're pulling the plug.
[01:42:53.366 --> 01:42:54.747]  They're going in to find the paperwork.
[01:42:55.447 --> 01:42:59.851]  Like you said, they're slowly destroying these people, and people aren't standing up.
[01:43:00.831 --> 01:43:03.914]  And, of course, I got a court on the 30th of April.
[01:43:04.134 --> 01:43:05.835]  The guy that shot at me and my wife, I told you about.
[01:43:05.875 --> 01:43:09.098]  I've been charged with aggravated kidnapping because I told him to drop his gun.
[01:43:09.878 --> 01:43:10.439]  So there we go.
[01:43:11.738 --> 01:43:12.838]  What station are you on?
[01:43:13.699 --> 01:43:14.139]  WLRM.
[01:43:14.179 --> 01:43:15.039]  I talked to you yesterday.
[01:43:15.059 --> 01:43:16.120]  1380 in Memphis.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.441]  And you inspire me so much.
[01:43:19.881 --> 01:43:20.742]  I'm a mechanical engineer.
[01:43:20.762 --> 01:43:21.802]  I'm not a talk show host.
[01:43:21.902 --> 01:43:22.962]  I just got fed up.
[01:43:23.583 --> 01:43:24.583]  I did my research.
[01:43:24.883 --> 01:43:27.344]  You know, that's one thing I learned how to do in college is research.
[01:43:27.744 --> 01:43:28.665]  Verify the facts.
[01:43:29.205 --> 01:43:33.247]  And you woke me up, Chief, and I guarantee you I'm on fire and I'll go down fighting.
[01:43:33.387 --> 01:43:39.029]  Well, you know, there's a lot of famous cases in Tennessee where the public has to throw out boss hog government.
[01:43:40.693 --> 01:43:44.194]  I mean, Tennessee, you know, has got great people in it, but it's got a lot of boss.
[01:43:44.535 --> 01:43:48.776]  What's that famous case where the World War II vets came back and their whole town was run by thug cops?
[01:43:49.276 --> 01:43:50.677]  The War of Athens, Tennessee.
[01:43:50.937 --> 01:43:52.317]  Yeah, the War of Athens, Tennessee.
[01:43:53.657 --> 01:43:54.478]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:54.518 --> 01:43:59.099]  But right now everybody's asleep or they're in that chilling effect that you talk about.
[01:43:59.119 --> 01:44:01.020]  That's the truth.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:01.960]  People are afraid.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:03.761]  They're afraid to speak out.
[01:44:03.781 --> 01:44:04.941]  They're afraid to do anything.
[01:44:06.962 --> 01:44:07.482]  It's pathetic.
[01:44:08.171 --> 01:44:09.071]  Well, good to hear from you.
[01:44:09.091 --> 01:44:09.871]  I appreciate the call.
[01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:12.592]  I'm going to play a video clip and then get into some financial news.
[01:44:13.612 --> 01:44:14.132]  Analyzing.
[01:44:14.172 --> 01:44:16.693]  It's far worse than what the Associated Press is saying.
[01:44:17.533 --> 01:44:18.793]  Right over here on the screen on this.
[01:44:20.693 --> 01:44:23.834]  Pentagon PR spending raises propaganda concerns.
[01:44:24.414 --> 01:44:27.474]  This, what they mention, is a fraction of Pentagon propaganda.
[01:44:27.795 --> 01:44:30.215]  The Pentagon is domestically engaging blogs.
[01:44:30.595 --> 01:44:35.456]  It's hired tens of thousands of private contractors to go out on blogs, say lies, threaten people.
[01:44:36.718 --> 01:44:44.403]  They spend millions of dollars in propaganda placement, movies and TV, not just the overt ads or three doors down video propaganda.
[01:44:45.004 --> 01:44:48.286]  And the Pentagon admits, yeah, we're propagandizing the American people.
[01:44:48.326 --> 01:44:49.087]  What's wrong with that?
[01:44:49.427 --> 01:44:54.451]  They're running PSYOPs because the Pentagon doesn't work for the American people.
[01:44:55.011 --> 01:44:57.973]  The Pentagon works for the offshore banks that have hijacked this nation.
[01:44:58.313 --> 01:44:59.514]  Let's go ahead and play part of the clip.
[01:45:02.356 --> 01:45:03.477]  Troops on the move.
[01:45:05.819 --> 01:45:07.000]  Guns blasting.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:14.964]  It's what one first thinks of when it comes to the military, but now the Pentagon is expanding a third front.
[01:45:15.484 --> 01:45:23.268]  The Defense Department is ramping up its spending as it delves further into shaping public opinion around the world and at home.
[01:45:23.588 --> 01:45:25.409]  This is a fight for the human terrain.
[01:45:25.429 --> 01:45:33.373]  It means that being able to influence populations to support government objectives.
[01:45:34.844 --> 01:45:36.285]  Influence populations.
[01:45:36.725 --> 01:45:37.625]  The American people.
[01:45:37.645 --> 01:45:39.046]  We're supposed to influence the government.
[01:45:39.086 --> 01:45:39.746]  It's our government.
[01:45:40.086 --> 01:45:45.308]  But now, I played that clip where they talk about martial law and the military and where their problem, how it's us against them.
[01:45:46.029 --> 01:45:47.089]  See, they're influencing.
[01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:49.290]  That's why you see the propaganda's everywhere now.
[01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:57.753]  It's just brainwashing and the army recruiters and marine recruiters threatening kids to arrest them if they don't sign the form to join.
[01:45:58.554 --> 01:45:59.134]  It's just criminal.
[01:46:00.103 --> 01:46:00.704]  Not just U.S.
[01:46:00.764 --> 01:46:05.809]  objectives, but the objectives of the country that we're supporting in the fight against insurgents or terrorists.
[01:46:07.068 --> 01:46:09.790]  It's a fight the Pentagon is taking seriously.
[01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:17.136]  In all, it's spending nearly $5 billion with more than 27,000 people working to get its message out.
[01:46:17.676 --> 01:46:24.301]  However, some in Congress are questioning if it's also breaking the law by engaging in domestic propaganda.
[01:46:24.661 --> 01:46:36.450]  I want to make sure that the taxpayers' money is not being used by government agencies for covert propaganda directed at American citizens in this country.
[01:46:37.295 --> 01:46:41.019]  Programs in question are as wide-ranging as the military itself.
[01:46:41.519 --> 01:46:46.364]  A program called Hometown News is partly run out of this office in San Antonio.
[01:46:46.865 --> 01:46:54.313]  Here, staffers put together print, radio, and television stories that they send out to thousands of news outlets across the country.
[01:46:54.867 --> 01:46:56.369]  Hi, I'm Corporal Christopher Pena.
[01:46:56.429 --> 01:46:57.971]  I'm coming to you live from Bahrain.
[01:46:58.411 --> 01:47:02.596]  Some of it is as innocuous as... Yeah, this is all a whitewash.
[01:47:02.696 --> 01:47:12.868]  I mean, it's fake stuff, TV ads, inside movies, propaganda, anti-gun statements they pay for, because they work for Wall Street that's offshore, that's busy looting the country.
[01:47:13.448 --> 01:47:15.090]  And it's NORTHCOM's job to make sure the...
[01:47:15.951 --> 01:47:19.352]  Enslavement of the American people, the takeover by foreign corporations happens.
[01:47:19.572 --> 01:47:20.633]  And I told you that years ago.
[01:47:20.673 --> 01:47:22.554]  It's now on record, the Army War College.
[01:47:22.574 --> 01:47:29.856]  It's now on record, the Naval War College, says their job is to secure the American people and make sure we go along with this.
[01:47:30.396 --> 01:47:34.818]  And to make sure the trillions every year in no-bid contracts go to the big defense contractors.
[01:47:35.358 --> 01:47:42.001]  But see, they produce all this fake news and then offer it free or pay to have it run on your local news and you never know it was paid for.
[01:47:43.004 --> 01:47:47.827]  Holiday greetings from soldiers far from home and getting others to enlist.
[01:47:48.388 --> 01:47:55.553]  But others are stories that look like any other news item and the public is not told it was produced by the military.
[01:47:56.052 --> 01:48:04.678]  This is what we do for the civilian media, to put the good news out there and to spread that military word back to the hometowns where these guys and gals are from.
[01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:10.983]  At Fort Bragg in North Carolina... What they're doing is taking over the United States.
[01:48:11.103 --> 01:48:22.912]  FEMA camps, civilian, General James L. Jones, National Security Council with no congressional approval, taking over every federal agency, that's the Washington Post, here's Defense Link,
[01:48:23.752 --> 01:48:28.494]  And in here it mentions the military is now going to work with Homeland Security fighting gangs.
[01:48:29.675 --> 01:48:30.875]  That's here at the bottom.
[01:48:30.895 --> 01:48:33.977]  I mean, this is... I can't even cover all this, how bad it is.
[01:48:34.617 --> 01:48:36.158]  Like Nazi Germany, they're taking over.
[01:48:36.458 --> 01:48:38.839]  And they all feel real... they all buy their own Kool-Aid.
[01:48:39.359 --> 01:48:40.920]  These guys all buy their own Kool-Aid.
[01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:48.729]  Some experts believe it's only a matter of time before transnational terrorism organizations link up across the U.S.
[01:48:48.769 --> 01:48:49.089]  border.
[01:48:49.449 --> 01:48:54.472]  This is a concern for local, state, and federal emergency agencies, but given the expanded role of U.S.
[01:48:54.492 --> 01:48:57.494]  military and domestic defense, it might also become a concern for the Pentagon.
[01:48:58.134 --> 01:49:01.436]  There's a section called Gangs, Terrorists, Cops, and the Defense.
[01:49:01.876 --> 01:49:05.959]  See, they know it's popular to defend the border, so they're selling the message.
[01:49:07.413 --> 01:49:09.114]  Putting troops on the streets of America for the border.
[01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:12.155]  When you read their real orders, it's to suppress the American people.
[01:49:12.715 --> 01:49:13.176]  Back to it.
[01:49:13.676 --> 01:49:15.997]  What's called psychological operations.
[01:49:16.377 --> 01:49:18.638]  Targeted at residents overseas.
[01:49:19.899 --> 01:49:25.321]  Specifically, they try to convince potential insurgents not to take up arms against America.
[01:49:25.521 --> 01:49:28.582]  I can tell you that there wouldn't be a single American disappointed in anything that we've done.
[01:49:29.263 --> 01:49:32.384]  With regard to, you know, what might be out there that they don't know about.
[01:49:32.904 --> 01:49:33.525]  And then in fact...
[01:49:34.485 --> 01:49:36.186]  This whole AP piece is a psyop.
[01:49:36.546 --> 01:49:41.909]  They cut from here with them propagandizing as to, well, they're doing it in Iraq, and what's wrong with it?
[01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:44.350]  It's all about lying to you.
[01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:47.932]  I mean, they tell the recruiters to go threaten your children in schools.
[01:49:47.952 --> 01:49:52.234]  They have access to them now, but they'll be arrested if they don't join the military.
[01:49:52.474 --> 01:49:53.015]  Back to him.
[01:49:54.275 --> 01:49:55.696]  They probably, frankly, don't care.
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:00.062]  Um, you know, because maybe they're safer as a result of it.
[01:50:00.162 --> 01:50:11.890]  But there has been some misinformation fed directly from the military, including the initial erroneous details surrounding Jessica Lynch's ordeal in Iraq and the death of former NFL star
[01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:13.310]  Alright, stop right there.
[01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:14.251]  We have it confirmed.
[01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:15.131]  We've talked to the family.
[01:50:15.351 --> 01:50:16.512]  They killed Pat Tillman.
[01:50:16.532 --> 01:50:17.612]  He was writing letters home.
[01:50:17.872 --> 01:50:20.853]  He was going to go public against the war about them growing opium over there.
[01:50:21.074 --> 01:50:21.794]  They murdered him.
[01:50:21.854 --> 01:50:22.934]  That's who the government is.
[01:50:23.254 --> 01:50:24.455]  They murder America.
[01:50:24.635 --> 01:50:25.855]  They're here to kill America.
[01:50:26.416 --> 01:50:29.457]  And then the Jessica Lynch thing, Jerry Bruckheimer directed that.
[01:50:30.017 --> 01:50:30.897]  They directed it.
[01:50:31.317 --> 01:50:32.778]  It was all staged.
[01:50:33.458 --> 01:50:34.479]  All lies.
[01:50:35.802 --> 01:50:37.403]  Enjoy your vaccines though, Tribbs.
[01:50:37.824 --> 01:50:38.865]  You think you're getting away with this?
[01:50:38.905 --> 01:50:40.967]  Your masters are euthanizing you right now.
[01:50:41.347 --> 01:50:42.148]  Soft kill weapon!

[01:52:10.864 --> 01:52:12.565]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:52:12.625 --> 01:52:18.367]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:27.870]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts.
[01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.691]  We're good to go.
[01:52:42.816 --> 01:52:51.183]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[01:52:51.284 --> 01:53:01.993]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins.
[01:53:02.233 --> 01:53:02.594]  I think so.
[01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.410]  Let's do it!
[01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:11.292]  We are back live, finishing up on the military front.
[01:54:12.393 --> 01:54:16.695]  It's militaries throughout history at the behest of an owning elite to take over countries.
[01:54:17.096 --> 01:54:17.956]  That's already happened.
[01:54:19.197 --> 01:54:21.599]  And all the Sprita Corps, George Washington, all of it.
[01:54:22.919 --> 01:54:24.901]  Iwo Jima, it's all gone, it's all over.
[01:54:25.241 --> 01:54:26.762]  Just like when Hitler took over the military.
[01:54:26.822 --> 01:54:28.743]  I'm sorry, are the individual troops bad?
[01:54:28.823 --> 01:54:29.063]  No.
[01:54:29.484 --> 01:54:34.407]  But all this brainwashing, and we've got to worship what they do, that's getting you ready for them here in the United States, and that's on record now.
[01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.271]  I'll get to all your calls tomorrow.
[01:54:37.291 --> 01:54:38.032]  We're just flat out of time.
[01:54:38.052 --> 01:54:40.255]  At the start of the show, I cover how they're going to ration health care.
[01:54:40.275 --> 01:54:41.197]  This is so incredible.
[01:54:41.217 --> 01:54:43.140]  This isn't the Republicans claiming this.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.361]  This is the Democrats saying it.
[01:54:45.804 --> 01:54:50.871]  But before we go any further, gold is still up at the 920 level.
[01:54:53.525 --> 01:54:54.465]  It's only going to go up.
[01:54:54.505 --> 01:54:58.026]  You know, the bankers are going to steal all the country's money, then they're going to devalue the currency.
[01:54:58.966 --> 01:55:02.847]  I love people getting prepared and getting position and not being at the behest of the New World Order.
[01:55:03.287 --> 01:55:04.247]  Get gold and silver.
[01:55:04.687 --> 01:55:06.588]  It is the best investment out there.
[01:55:06.668 --> 01:55:07.988]  Is any investment perfectly safe?
[01:55:08.048 --> 01:55:10.769]  No, but this always has intrinsic value.
[01:55:11.209 --> 01:55:13.069]  All the evidence shows it's going to go straight up.
[01:55:13.449 --> 01:55:16.830]  It was 280 bucks when you started plugging it, now it's 900 and something.
[01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:21.531]  I believe it's going to go well over a thousand, but regardless, regardless,
[01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:23.290]  of this.
[01:55:24.731 --> 01:55:28.612]  It has intrinsic value and is an investment they can't destroy.
[01:55:28.632 --> 01:55:33.034]  Okay, so, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to take action.
[01:55:33.074 --> 01:55:39.216]  Ted Anderson, just four weeks ago, was selling gold for $715 an ounce here.
[01:55:39.476 --> 01:55:42.197]  And he ran out of that when it was $850.
[01:55:42.378 --> 01:55:44.318]  He passed on that savings.
[01:55:44.398 --> 01:55:47.259]  Now, he bought a bunch of gold and silver when it was at $830.
[01:55:49.113 --> 01:55:51.794]  He's still selling it with that price factored in.
[01:55:51.814 --> 01:55:53.974]  You know, when the market was at $8.30.
[01:55:54.655 --> 01:55:59.356]  Now, he is at the very tail end of all of it, and you see it go up.
[01:56:01.457 --> 01:56:05.118]  This will probably be the last time we're not sure Ted got some big purchases in.
[01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:11.240]  Here at the end, Ted, tell folks what you have left at that $8.30 level, though gold's been staying right up there above $900.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:18.262]  Well, just yesterday we finally received a thousand francs that we ordered in at that level, at that $8.30 level.
[01:56:19.779 --> 01:56:22.060]  And we also picked up a bunch of British Sovereigns.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.421]  I can't remember the count on those.
[01:56:24.301 --> 01:56:25.502]  Currently, I just looked again.
[01:56:25.542 --> 01:56:35.387]  Today, if I price them out, the francs are at $228, although this group is at $217, so you get to buy out of that group, which is going to save you a ton of money.
[01:56:35.827 --> 01:56:41.070]  British Sovereigns currently right now at $279 is what you'd be paying based upon today's market.
[01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:43.151]  Right now I have them at $265.
[01:56:43.931 --> 01:56:49.214]  Another thing that I ran into, Mercury Dimes, I had to pull those off the sheet and go to Walking Libs again.
[01:56:49.915 --> 01:56:50.816]  Well, that's what I try to do.
[01:56:50.836 --> 01:56:51.756]  I mean, gold has been bouncing.
[01:56:51.776 --> 01:56:52.377]  It's like a ratchet.
[01:57:14.195 --> 01:57:18.159]  Bounces down a little bit, finds the support level, and up it goes again.
[01:57:19.961 --> 01:57:27.269]  When it broke through that $800 level, $896 I think was the low, $891 somewhere right in there, I was buying.
[01:57:27.329 --> 01:57:30.192]  That's why I picked up a lot more stuff.
[01:57:30.252 --> 01:57:33.576]  I'm really trying to hold inventory when the prices go down.
[01:57:35.097 --> 01:57:36.098]  Folks can't beat this deal.
[01:57:36.118 --> 01:57:38.100]  The Brokers will be there till midnight or leave your number.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.281]  They'll call you back in the morning.
[01:57:39.301 --> 01:57:39.941]  1-800.
[01:57:40.022 --> 01:57:41.443]  Give them the number.
[01:57:41.463 --> 01:57:41.483]  686-2237.
[01:57:41.723 --> 01:57:42.624]  I should let you do it, Alex.
[01:57:42.684 --> 01:57:43.725]  You do it better than I do.
[01:57:43.745 --> 01:57:44.285]  No, no, no, no.
[01:57:50.691 --> 01:57:51.251]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:51.271 --> 01:57:52.832]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:55.794 --> 01:58:01.418]  Folks are insane if they're trusting these socialists taking over the whole country and handing them the money of the bankers.
[01:58:01.578 --> 01:58:03.220]  Why are they staying in fiat currency?
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.520]  They're going to kill the dollar.
[01:58:04.721 --> 01:58:05.981]  They're going to remonetize it.
[01:58:06.001 --> 01:58:06.282]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:06.302 --> 01:58:07.242]  I hope folks take advantage.
[01:58:07.262 --> 01:58:07.302]  800-686-237.
[01:58:07.362 --> 01:58:08.343]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:58:08.383 --> 01:58:08.783]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:14.167 --> 01:58:14.407]  You bet.
[01:58:14.447 --> 01:58:15.727]  Hey, folks, rebroadcast now.
[01:58:16.008 --> 01:58:17.688]  First hour was jam-packed with news.

[01:58:34.885 --> 01:58:39.511]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:39.632 --> 01:58:42.395]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:42.596 --> 01:58:45.459]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:50.386]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:58:50.586 --> 01:58:51.507]  If you simply prepare.
[01:58:51.707 --> 01:58:54.630]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:58:54.950 --> 01:59:01.857]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
