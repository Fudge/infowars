[00:00:01.852 --> 00:00:03.753]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.095]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.320]  Big Brother.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.681]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:17.862]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:19.323]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:21.024]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:25.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:29.890]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.144]  All right, we are back.
[00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.454]  We're gonna give this guy a say in this segment, but you know, it's just a ludicrous argument again.
[00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:42.075]  I mean...
[00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:46.672]  If you're watching PrisonPlanet.TV right now, who's on the back cover?
[00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:48.253]  Oh, that's Bin Laden and Bush.
[00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.494]  Oh, it's Matrix of Evil.
[00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:50.315]  Who's on the cover?
[00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:52.297]  Oh, well, that's George Bush right there.
[00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:55.421]  Oh, who's on Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove?
[00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.062]  It's both George Bushes.
[00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.804]  Oh, who's on American Dictators?
[00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:02.288]  And by the way, John Kerry, a little puppet, is in the background as well.
[00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:05.431]  But this is a papier-mâché of Bush with devil horns.
[00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.171]  on him.
[00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:11.976]  That's not as provocative as having Obama in the title or Bush in the title.
[00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:17.940]  No, we don't have any films with quote-unquote Bush in the title, but that's because it isn't the Bush deception.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.302]  They didn't sell us on George Bush.
[00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:30.529]  You know, they sold us a close election between him and Gore and then a supposed close election between him and his cousin on both sides, third on one side, eighth on the other, John Kerry.
[00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:31.350]  Go ahead, Gary.
[00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:33.652]  You still there?
[00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:35.494]  Gary dropped off.
[00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:42.463]  You know, you drop off, I'm going to give you the chance to spew your lies and hate and you can't even hang with the big boys.
[00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:43.284]  I feel bad for you.
[00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:44.746]  Coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:55.422]  We're going to play this SeaWorld clip of Alex Jones really exposing the biometric smart grid cashless society control grid agenda.
[00:01:55.562 --> 00:02:03.864]  I'm pretty sure he talks about DHS and this has been years and years and years since I've actually viewed it but you know this is why you want a PrisonPlanet.TV subscription.
[00:02:03.884 --> 00:02:07.325]  I mean number one you get all the movies I just talked about and so much more.
[00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:09.365]  I mean I got the 9-11 Chronicles over here as well.
[00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:13.565]  Number two, you get to see some of this great stuff.
[00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:21.546]  Alex Jones has been doing this for well over ten years and his library of work is really just, it's inconceivable.
[00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:22.807]  It's unmatched.
[00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:29.088]  He has done so much with so little and expanded so much in such a little amount of time.
[00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.149]  I don't think people realize how hard this is to do.
[00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.149]  What a difficult job this can be.
[00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.950]  How trying it is.
[00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.891]  Especially when you have people like that.
[00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.172]  I don't like the way you named your movie.
[00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:48.376]  Well, I don't think that millions of people would have gone out and seen it if it wasn't called the quote-unquote Obama deception or gotten over the left-right paradigm.
[00:02:48.396 --> 00:03:01.002]  I think it was a genius name and that's why we have military members from the United States calling us from Japan telling it woke them up and all over the world in fact and that's why it has millions of views with multiple copies on the internet.
[00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:04.564]  Alright, let's go to Terry in Texas.
[00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:05.184]  Terry, you're on the line.
[00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:07.129]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:19.254]  Hey, listen, you get a chance at the program, go to Chick.com, like the baby chicken, C-H-I-C-K.com and read the story, seven-part story of the ex-Jesuit priest, Father Alberto Rivera.
[00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:23.568]  If you really want to know the truth, then who is behind the wall?
[00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:41.621]  You know, say that Alex Jones is some kind of a Jesuit assassin.
[00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:49.252]  People want to say I'm some kind of a Mossad operative and that we're disinformation agents that are out to keep the truth from you.
[00:03:49.272 --> 00:03:54.380]  Ooh, the Council for National Policy that was made in the 80s is setting up everything.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:12.472]  No, they're just another think tank organization who I don't tend to agree with that also fund black operations that are part of the bigger octopus or picture, just like the Jesuits and the Catholic Church, you know, just like the Mossad and Israel, just like Pakistan and the ISI.
[00:04:12.532 --> 00:04:14.693]  They all have their compartmentalized role.
[00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:20.517]  People are just, you know, just so overtly ignorant and they really want to lead other people into the wrong path.
[00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:21.358]  They don't want to lead you
[00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:23.279]  Towards the apex of the pyramid.
[00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:30.404]  They want to lead you to lower rungs of the pyramid so that you really lose sight and you start infighting and attacking other people.
[00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:31.665]  It's out of control.
[00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:37.008]  And they want to call this show up, you know, while I'm hosting it to try to take advantage of the fact that Alex isn't here.
[00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:41.491]  I mean, you want to see the truth right now, you go here, I know everything.
[00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:43.433]  Look, we're not perfect here.
[00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:46.415]  We report as much as we possibly can with a short level staff.
[00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:48.196]  I mean, how many websites do we have to put up?
[00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:49.857]  How many movies do we have to make?
[00:04:51.087 --> 00:04:54.950]  You know, we should be judged by the fruits of our labor, by the content of our character.
[00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.412]  But no, people just want a gun for us because we're number one in the alternative media.
[00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:02.635]  Join the Info War, get to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a membership right now.
[00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:08.440]  Back after this with Alex Jones, Biometric SeaWorld.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.624]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:16.085]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:20.108]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Innerfood.
[00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:22.052]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:28.654]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:32.355]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:34.155]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:37.196]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:38.856]  And their formula really works.
[00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:41.697]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:05:41.937 --> 00:05:47.838]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:50.381]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.863]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:54.846]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:05:55.186 --> 00:06:00.672]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:05.317]  That's www.enerfood.com.
[00:06:05.518 --> 00:06:08.441]  Or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:14.948]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:19.011]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:24.975]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:30.259]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:34.562]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:36.943]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:40.243]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:54.948]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[00:06:55.228 --> 00:06:59.870]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.570]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:04.192]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:12.597]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:17.384]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:07:17.464 --> 00:07:20.228]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:23.292]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:28.199]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:29.340]  If you simply prepare.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.502]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:39.688]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:42.910]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.932]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:54.280]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.203]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:58.223 --> 00:07:59.544]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:59.584 --> 00:08:00.165]  Take action today.
[00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:02.187]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.643]  Is the T-Rex a political talk?
[00:08:12.663 --> 00:08:16.008]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:27.781]  All right, we're going to go to DP, John, Chris, Steven, Freeburger, and others.
[00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.002]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:32.566]  I want to thank one more sponsor for the day.
[00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:34.248]  It's e-cigaretteschoice.com.
[00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:36.811]  That's e-cigaretteschoice.com.
[00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:37.692]  So what is an e-cigarette?
[00:08:37.712 --> 00:08:38.693]  It's an electronic cigarette.
[00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:41.416]  It's what I'm holding in my hand right here on Prism Planet.
[00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:42.817]  We're good to go.
[00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.691]  And blow out.
[00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.832]  It's that simple.
[00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:06.473]  It's got a little cartridge on the back.
[00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:07.013]  It's really neat.
[00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:07.794]  There are different models.
[00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:10.896]  There's the e-cigarette mini like this that really look like a cigarette.
[00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:14.279]  Then there's the Hunter Thompson Gonzo style, if you will.
[00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:16.581]  It's ecigaretteschoice.com.
[00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:17.521]  Go check it out.
[00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:25.107]  It's a really cool product, especially if you're trying to quit smoking or, again, just trying to smoke indoors without having to go into the freezing cold or the bitter heat.
[00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:29.893]  Alright, we are about to play this blast from the past segment.
[00:09:29.953 --> 00:09:32.295]  It's somewhere over on PrisonPlanet.tv, I think.
[00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:32.716]  I don't know.
[00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:34.318]  Buried in the archives somewhere.
[00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:36.140]  We were able to pull it up.
[00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:42.387]  It is the biometric SeaWorld clip of Alex Jones and it is money from start to finish.
[00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:42.928]  Hit it.
[00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.632]  SeaWorld in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:53.894]  Owned by Anheuser-Busch.
[00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:57.358]  Biometrically scanning those that enter the park.
[00:09:58.078 --> 00:09:59.520]  For absolutely no reason.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.301]  It was a photo ID!
[00:10:02.697 --> 00:10:05.378]  But now, you've got to scan biometrically.
[00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:29.670]  And big corporations have lined up to sell biometrics and RFID to the population, in preparation of the new national sales tax, new international taxes, and the track and trace everything we buy, sell and do, which they publicly admitted in the Total Information Awareness Network, that by the way, was not cancelled when they fired Admiral Poindexter, they just changed the name.
[00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:34.113]  So again, you can't even go to SeaWorld without biometrically scanning now.
[00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:35.934]  It's disgusting.
[00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:43.337]  From grocery stores, to your banks, to ATMs, it's going in everywhere.
[00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:50.600]  School children have to thumb scan to get their school lunches, have to thumb scan to get on school buses in many school districts around the country.
[00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:55.603]  And I was just curious, curious about these scanners.
[00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:56.463]  What's going on with those?
[00:10:58.643 --> 00:10:59.363]  Well, just tell me then.
[00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:05.327]  What they're doing is, they scan, it's the season pass voters, they scan their hands, and a DVD, there's a picture.
[00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:07.689]  But why wouldn't they just look at the picture of the person?
[00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:09.670]  Why would you... Yeah, the new cards don't have it.
[00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:09.910]  Yeah.
[00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:19.556]  Oh, so you're going away from somebody just looking at your picture to scanning your... And if you don't want to do that, you have to show us your ID to prove that it's you.
[00:11:19.656 --> 00:11:19.996]  Yeah.
[00:11:20.977 --> 00:11:22.758]  And plus you're biometrically scanned to do that.
[00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.419]  You know the grocery stores are putting these in.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.840]  What do you think of all this?
[00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:31.453]  I'm a retard!
[00:11:32.873 --> 00:11:40.036]  So you're taking your pictures off the card and putting a hand scanner on there?
[00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:40.236]  Yes.
[00:11:40.856 --> 00:11:42.176]  Doesn't that kind of spread germs?
[00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:44.617]  We have hand sanitizer if anybody wants it.
[00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:46.238]  Ah, it's all been thought of.
[00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:48.399]  Very interesting system.
[00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:50.579]  So it's biometric?
[00:11:53.064 --> 00:11:54.305]  I'm not sure.
[00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:56.606]  I was told how to use it and that was it.
[00:11:56.706 --> 00:11:57.546]  What do they tell you about it?
[00:11:58.387 --> 00:12:00.208]  You have to scan your hand.
[00:12:00.568 --> 00:12:01.608]  It's a 3D vision picture.
[00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:04.370]  And they do it twice.
[00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.350]  The first time they come in.
[00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.412]  And then once every other time after that to validate them.
[00:12:09.532 --> 00:12:11.814]  And then it instantly identifies them?
[00:12:11.994 --> 00:12:13.474]  Yes.
[00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:15.415]  It's normally hooked up and working though?
[00:12:16.016 --> 00:12:16.116]  Yes.
[00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:17.456]  Why isn't it on today?
[00:12:17.476 --> 00:12:18.597]  It is on today.
[00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:20.338]  It's working today!
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.721]  Oh, really?
[00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:22.702]  It's working right now.
[00:12:23.603 --> 00:12:24.244]  Oh, really?
[00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:26.347]  Do you have a season pass?
[00:12:26.387 --> 00:12:27.008]  Yes, I do.
[00:12:27.028 --> 00:12:31.755]  It only works with the season pass holders because the new ones, the new season pass, don't have a picture on it.
[00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:35.721]  I noticed that, but when I came through, they said, oh, it's raining, you don't have to do it.
[00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:42.166]  Oh, they told you to cover them at first?
[00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:44.988]  Let them open.
[00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:46.829]  How long have you been using these?
[00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.071]  It just started this year.
[00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:51.291]  When did the new season start?
[00:12:52.092 --> 00:12:52.472]  March 6th.
[00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:53.393]  Do people like it?
[00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:54.673]  So far, yes.
[00:12:54.713 --> 00:12:56.334]  But you said some people don't.
[00:12:56.774 --> 00:12:59.096]  Some people don't want to use it because of germs and everything.
[00:12:59.596 --> 00:12:59.696]  Ah.
[00:13:01.117 --> 00:13:02.237]  Alright, well very interesting.
[00:13:02.278 --> 00:13:02.678]  Thank you.
[00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:04.999]  So, this is the new system to get into the park?
[00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:05.419]  Yes.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.500]  Alright, thank you.
[00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:10.938]  So this is the new biometric system.
[00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.460]  What does it say on the screen when it shows they're a good citizen?
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.540]  It says accepted.
[00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:17.362]  That means that you can come into the park.
[00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:18.963]  Now let me bring this up to you guys.
[00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:24.747]  All over the country, grocery stores, banks, everybody are putting these in.
[00:13:25.207 --> 00:13:25.748]  Oh they are?
[00:13:25.908 --> 00:13:26.168]  Yes.
[00:13:26.188 --> 00:13:26.849]  I didn't know that.
[00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:31.972]  H-E-B in Austin and H-E-B in Houston is starting to put it in some of their stores.
[00:13:32.132 --> 00:13:32.672]  I didn't know that.
[00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:39.257]  But I've read the federal documents where they say that you're going to have to thumb scan, a biometric scan, to buy or sell anything.
[00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:40.658]  Oh, you've heard that?
[00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:43.901]  No, I didn't know that, but I heard that on the news.
[00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:46.723]  Um, no sir, the exit's around the corner, turn to your left.
[00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:53.228]  So you heard on the news, we're gonna have to, but that's, I mean, that's like Big Brother, but if you're a Christian, you'd kind of see it as Mark of the Beast type stuff.
[00:13:53.248 --> 00:13:53.468]  Yeah.
[00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:55.230]  Can I help you?
[00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.451]  No, we're done.
[00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:59.493]  I'm waiting for my husband and I need to get through.
[00:13:59.573 --> 00:13:59.953]  Okay.
[00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:03.937]  Have you heard anybody talk about that and say, it's kind of like Mark of the Beast?
[00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:07.481]  No, there's other people that don't want to do it, so I just have to.
[00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:09.342]  Oh, they don't tell you why they don't want to do it?
[00:14:09.362 --> 00:14:11.283]  Yeah, they haven't told me why they don't want to do it.
[00:14:11.304 --> 00:14:12.564]  They just say they don't want to do it.
[00:14:12.604 --> 00:14:13.285]  What percentage?
[00:14:13.325 --> 00:14:14.566]  Like 1 out of 10 doesn't want to do it?
[00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:14.926]  Or how many?
[00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:18.068]  No, it's really, yeah, like 1 out of 10.
[00:14:18.168 --> 00:14:22.211]  Everybody else does it because everybody's like, wow, it's something different, you know?
[00:14:22.551 --> 00:14:24.632]  Oh, it's like a new technology.
[00:14:24.693 --> 00:14:25.193]  Woo!
[00:14:25.213 --> 00:14:25.573]  Oh, look.
[00:14:25.653 --> 00:14:31.757]  And then you take it out and do the same.
[00:14:34.657 --> 00:14:37.279]  It's so easy being a global citizen.
[00:14:39.501 --> 00:14:41.362]  Sir, do you like the new system?
[00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:42.103]  Yes sir, I do.
[00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:46.426]  You know they're gonna make you do that to go to the grocery store.
[00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:47.346]  I've read the federal plans.
[00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:47.787]  Oh yeah?
[00:14:47.947 --> 00:14:50.228]  Did you notice that you scan when you got a driver's license?
[00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:50.849]  No.
[00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.107]  When you got a driver's license, they didn't scan you?
[00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:54.748]  Remember putting your finger on the red light?
[00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:55.289]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:55.689]  Remember that?
[00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:56.049]  Yeah.
[00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.450]  They've been doing that for ten years.
[00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.312]  This is part of a total grid.
[00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.773]  And I know you love your son here.
[00:15:00.793 --> 00:15:02.274]  You need to research biometrics.
[00:15:02.294 --> 00:15:03.315]  This is bad news.
[00:15:03.755 --> 00:15:04.015]  Alright.
[00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:05.136]  And people need to complain about it, yeah.
[00:15:05.156 --> 00:15:06.977]  About what?
[00:15:07.478 --> 00:15:08.018]  What's bad news?
[00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:09.039]  About biometrics.
[00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:12.382]  They're going to install a new national sales tax using this.
[00:15:12.702 --> 00:15:19.347]  Big corporations have lined up under Homeland Security funding to put the biometrics in to get us to accept it.
[00:15:20.447 --> 00:15:29.231]  And so then when you scan your hand, when that happens, when you put your hand on the scanner, you then are being conditioned to be part of the system.
[00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.252]  So research it.
[00:15:31.292 --> 00:15:31.892]  Good talking to you.
[00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.214]  All right, let's hit the clip.
[00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:37.154]  How much longer was left in that, guys?
[00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:38.415]  About a minute left or not even?
[00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:41.656]  Maybe we'll play more of it later.
[00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:42.877]  I want to take some more calls.
[00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:46.839]  And then at the 30 after, we're actually going to have the writer of this
[00:15:48.206 --> 00:15:50.567]  I think it's of this latest article.
[00:15:50.887 --> 00:15:52.128]  It had about two, three minutes left.
[00:15:52.328 --> 00:15:53.649]  Well, we might play more of that later.
[00:15:54.409 --> 00:16:01.713]  This article on the EMT driver and associate, the other EMT worker who was tending to the sick lady.
[00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:04.275]  We're going to get the whole story from the reporter who was on the scene.
[00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:06.276]  We've been trying to get the people actually involved.
[00:16:06.296 --> 00:16:06.876]  They don't seem to be.
[00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:09.237]  Wanting to come on the radio program.
[00:16:09.257 --> 00:16:14.418]  I don't know if they're actually aware of who we are or they're scared of the media or they're scared of the repercussions in their town.
[00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:18.640]  But we're going to get start to finish what did happen there outside of what you saw on the video.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:25.122]  You know, this outrageous out of control cop putting his hands on an EMT worker who's trying to help somebody.
[00:16:25.182 --> 00:16:28.703]  I mean, they tried to arrest him and people he resisted arrest.
[00:16:28.723 --> 00:16:30.964]  Had he not resisted, he would have gone to jail.
[00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:32.424]  He didn't go to jail.
[00:16:32.444 --> 00:16:33.245]  There's a state law.
[00:16:33.265 --> 00:16:35.465]  You know, we didn't read that, I don't think, on air.
[00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:37.486]  But he goes, it's a state law.
[00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:42.448]  And that's because there is a state law that actually protects paramedics in Oklahoma.
[00:16:42.488 --> 00:16:47.429]  A new law in Oklahoma makes it a felony to attack or injure emergency medical technicians, which it should be.
[00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.090]  But will the law really protect them?
[00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.171]  In Oklahoma last year, 14 EMSA paramedics were attacked while on the job.
[00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:57.252]  Eight of those were in Tulsa, and six in Oklahoma City.
[00:16:57.432 --> 00:17:02.654]  So he immediately says, there's a state law, and like I said, he really did keep his cool.
[00:17:02.694 --> 00:17:04.795]  Those cops were way, way out of line.
[00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:08.816]  You can go see the video over at Infowars.com or my blog, TheInfoWarrior.com.
[00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:11.277]  DP in California, you're on the air.
[00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:12.197]  Yes, DP.
[00:17:13.393 --> 00:17:15.094]  Thanks, Jason, for taking my call.
[00:17:15.414 --> 00:17:21.016]  I was really interested in the clip you showed there at SeaWorld.
[00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:24.938]  I was not aware that that was in control.
[00:17:25.638 --> 00:17:31.180]  I hate to kind of digress, but I need some help on HR 1207.
[00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:39.544]  The only thing I have is off of governmenttrack.us, and in the summary it says that
[00:17:40.414 --> 00:17:55.439]  This act repeals the authority of a Comptroller General to carry on an on-site examination of an open insured bank or bank holding company only if the appropriate federal regulatory agency has consented in writing.
[00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:59.801]  It retains the authority of the Comptroller General to audit a federal agency.
[00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:09.604]  When my friends see this, they say, I don't want no part of that if it repeals the authority of the Comptroller General to carry out these on-site
[00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:20.568]  I pretty well understand this, but is there a place that we can go to to find a better explanation of exactly... And the bill you're talking about is the audit of the Fed bill, right?
[00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:28.430]  I would go to CampaignForLiberty.com or RonPaulWarRoom.com.
[00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.652]  I'm sure there's all sorts of things about the intricacies of the bill.
[00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:34.814]  You know, how it's going to work and how it's going to enact.
[00:18:34.834 --> 00:18:38.357]  I think we've done some stories over at InfoWars.com as well.
[00:18:38.397 --> 00:18:41.919]  I know there are a ton of stories going up every day and it's very hard to go through all these things.
[00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:43.240]  Go check Campaign For Liberty.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.362]  I'm sure that there's a link that explains the entire bill over there.
[00:18:46.382 --> 00:18:47.203]  I thank you for the call.
[00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:49.044]  Let's go to John in Florida.
[00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:49.724]  John, you're on the air.
[00:18:50.325 --> 00:18:50.705]  Yes, John.
[00:18:51.633 --> 00:19:06.877]  Hey, uh, yeah, this thing, uh, like I was doing some research and I found out that, uh, when Governor, uh, he was the Governor of Texas, George Bush, that, uh, he, he executed like 150 people.
[00:19:07.297 --> 00:19:08.937]  Yeah, he executed a bunch of people.
[00:19:09.518 --> 00:19:09.718]  Huh?
[00:19:10.098 --> 00:19:11.358]  Yeah, he executed a bunch of people.
[00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:15.019]  Do you know the one, he only commuted one sentence?
[00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:17.980]  Yeah, what's this, uh, the, the Madam Morris murders?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.240]  Is that what we're going to get into right here?
[00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:22.101]  No, it was Henry Lee Lucas.
[00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:44.645]  In connection with these Brownsville and Matamoros murders, these ritualistic killings.
[00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.307]  Beyond that, I mean, there aren't a lot of media reports for me to really get into.
[00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:55.892]  There's a quote from 2000, which I don't even want to say because it's from one news source, and I'd like to get the video clip before I actually speak about it.
[00:19:56.132 --> 00:19:56.973]  But it is interesting.
[00:19:57.033 --> 00:19:59.014]  Go check out what I just talked about, my man.
[00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:02.437]  We're gonna go to Chris, Steven, Freeburger, and others on the other side.
[00:20:02.697 --> 00:20:04.358]  It's the Alex Jones Show, back after this.
[00:20:08.829 --> 00:20:11.011]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:20:11.171 --> 00:20:20.297]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:28.542]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:20:28.703 --> 00:20:34.627]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:20:35.487 --> 00:20:36.067]  We're good to go.
[00:20:57.077 --> 00:21:00.999]  If you owe 10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:01.259]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.520]  Call today.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.002]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:20.730]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:27.435]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:29.557]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:29.717 --> 00:21:32.099]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:43.068]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:21:45.353 --> 00:21:46.614]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.415]  It's about a one world government.
[00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:55.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:22:04.067 --> 00:22:05.208]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:05.628 --> 00:22:06.889]  The people strike back.
[00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.493]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:12.904 --> 00:22:18.329]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:19.870]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.974]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:24.614 --> 00:22:37.866]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:38.406 --> 00:22:43.769]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:49.971]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:22:51.932 --> 00:22:53.013]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:53.553]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:55.274]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:55.294 --> 00:22:55.354]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.174 --> 00:23:08.715]  You worry.
[00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:10.938]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:23:11.218 --> 00:23:11.499]  Hi.
[00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:14.243]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:23:14.543 --> 00:23:18.809]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.273]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:23:21.573 --> 00:23:24.618]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:26.620]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.363]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:23:29.623 --> 00:23:33.047]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:23:33.347 --> 00:23:37.452]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:23:37.772 --> 00:23:41.496]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:23:41.856 --> 00:23:47.858]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:23:48.178 --> 00:23:50.319]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:52.219]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:56.840]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:23:57.301 --> 00:23:57.941]  Start now.
[00:23:58.221 --> 00:23:59.181]  Knowledge is power.
[00:23:59.921 --> 00:24:00.742]  Better take action.
[00:24:00.942 --> 00:24:01.882]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:34.835]  All those drifter's days are past me now, I've got so much more to think about.
[00:24:37.438 --> 00:24:46.606]  Deadlines and commitments, what to leave in, what to leave out.
[00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:50.230]  Against the wind, we were running.
[00:24:52.267 --> 00:24:53.487]  And that's what we need to be doing.
[00:24:53.907 --> 00:24:57.468]  Because right now, the wind is blowing in a very dangerous direction, folks.
[00:24:57.608 --> 00:25:07.411]  And we're going to play more of that biometric clip, because he does switch it up from being outside and goes internally, and you really see even more of the biometric equipment they have inside of SeaWorld.
[00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:09.712]  It's actually just pretty crazy.
[00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:14.276]  But we're also going to really outline this whole Obama speech.
[00:25:14.296 --> 00:25:16.818]  I think I started recording maybe two or three minutes into it.
[00:25:16.858 --> 00:25:19.821]  We're going to break it down all in the next hour.
[00:25:19.941 --> 00:25:22.003]  Alex Jones coming up at the top of the hour.
[00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:30.772]  And in about five minutes, we're going to have the person that wrote this article on the EMT being jackbooted, if you will, by the police.
[00:25:31.172 --> 00:25:32.854]  Oh, don't try to save that old woman's life.
[00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:34.656]  Get in the car.
[00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:36.437]  You are under arrest.
[00:25:36.997 --> 00:25:39.099]  All right, let's go to, who are we on?
[00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:41.320]  We are on, I believe, Chris in Maryland.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.860]  You're on the air.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.400]  Chris.
[00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:45.182]  What's going on, Jason?
[00:25:45.602 --> 00:25:46.142]  How you doing, sir?
[00:25:46.942 --> 00:25:47.543]  Not too bad.
[00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:48.943]  Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:25:49.003 --> 00:25:50.344]  I'm here in Frederick, Maryland.
[00:25:51.765 --> 00:25:53.926]  Just wanted to touch on a couple subjects.
[00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:57.968]  I'd say about 10 years ago, I was driving to D.C.
[00:25:58.568 --> 00:26:00.069]  I was driving down the interstate, the 495.
[00:26:02.641 --> 00:26:11.505]  Uh, to come from Frederick to D.C., there's a road called 270, another interstate, and I was observing these boxes on the side of the roads.
[00:26:11.665 --> 00:26:25.070]  It looked like, uh, readers to read license plates, uh, possibly, I don't know what other identification it was for, but this was, you know, ten plus years ago, and me being, you know, the paranoid guy that I am,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.861]  I started to research it, look into it, and I haven't got much out of it.
[00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:36.103]  I've actually contacted the State Highway Administration and looked into that, but I haven't got much out of it.
[00:26:36.163 --> 00:26:37.703]  And then you guys talked about the grid.
[00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:48.406]  I just felt that it probably, being around the nation's capital, that perhaps they have these on I-70, which goes from the east to the west already.
[00:26:48.686 --> 00:26:51.907]  And it's been there for maybe much longer than we thought.
[00:26:52.383 --> 00:27:01.912]  Well, I mean, if you go to a place like Virginia, where there is a lot of national security infrastructure and underground bunkers, I mean, there's cameras everywhere on the road, all over the place.
[00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:04.034]  I mean, talk about a grid that's built there.
[00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:06.376]  You go to New York City, that same grid is almost in place.
[00:27:06.396 --> 00:27:08.017]  You go to the UK, that grid is in place.
[00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:10.419]  And now they're militarizing those grids all over.
[00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:12.061]  You don't see that grid, for instance,
[00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:41.842]  as heavy in a boston massachusetts area but now they're upping the police force those are just precursors to what they want to do to not only the entire nation but eventually the entire world and uh... they almost can get around that with the uh... spy satellite technology that they have now that i mean just look at you know google earth and google street view i mean you can get pretty nitty-gritty with just that technology that's open source so i mean this has been a you know they've been building infrastructure for some time
[00:27:42.122 --> 00:27:46.684]  This is just a big coming out party with the Obama administration and his speech today.
[00:27:46.724 --> 00:27:49.445]  And again, we're going to analyze that speech in the next hour.
[00:27:49.485 --> 00:27:50.386]  I thank you for the call.
[00:27:50.646 --> 00:27:52.406]  Let's go to Stephen in Texas.
[00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:53.127]  Stephen, you're on the line.
[00:27:54.287 --> 00:27:54.847]  Yes, Stephen.
[00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:56.768]  Hey, good afternoon, Jason.
[00:27:57.428 --> 00:28:06.232]  Hey, first of all, I wanted to say, man, with some of the calls you've been getting today, I kind of, I think I figured out what's going on here.
[00:28:06.332 --> 00:28:09.654]  See, you know, you're from up north just like I am.
[00:28:09.794 --> 00:28:10.474]  And so, you know,
[00:28:11.138 --> 00:28:14.181]  Santa Claus and the myth about him.
[00:28:14.201 --> 00:28:15.662]  He's at the North Pole.
[00:28:16.443 --> 00:28:25.290]  Obviously, Santa Claus, because he's a mythological character and you're from up north too, that proves that you're promoting myths.
[00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:27.792]  You just don't know what you're talking about.
[00:28:27.832 --> 00:28:29.413]  You're just living in a fantasy land.
[00:28:30.547 --> 00:28:45.539]  Actually, what I'm doing is I'm trying to use absurdity to point out absurdity, because what I'm saying makes a whole lot more sense than these people that are calling in to you, like this guy earlier, making a big deal about the fact that the name Bush isn't in any of Alex's movies.
[00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.960]  Now, I want to say this, dude.
[00:28:47.781 --> 00:28:49.662]  You need to wake up and get real to me.
[00:28:49.722 --> 00:28:51.404]  Are you blind or just stupid?
[00:28:51.904 --> 00:28:56.868]  I've seen just about every one of Alex's movies, and yours as well, Jason.
[00:28:57.563 --> 00:29:11.216]  And I mean, for crying out loud, 9-11, the road to tyranny, that whole thing exposes the fact that the Bush administration was intimately tied in with 9-11 in carrying out that whole thing.
[00:29:11.296 --> 00:29:14.679]  So, for you to go into stuff like that, here's the bottom line.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.543]  Okay, Obama deception, and I've called in and mentioned this before, Jason.
[00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:20.006]  And you agreed with me.
[00:29:20.406 --> 00:29:39.080]  The thrust of that name, what it means is that the Obama deception is getting caught up in this left versus right thing, you know, focusing on the fact that he's a so-called liberal and a leftist and all this other stuff, instead of the fact that the agenda he's pushing, which is he works for the same people that Bush worked for.
[00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:43.884]  And the bottom line is this, you need to wake up because regardless of what's going on,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:51.445]  One day, these people that are running things are going to come to your door, and then it's not going to make a difference whose name is on the documentary.
[00:29:51.465 --> 00:29:52.466]  Steven, you're dead on.
[00:29:52.486 --> 00:29:58.390]  We'll be back after this with Dave Jordan discussing the EMT and Oklahoma PD.
[00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.431]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:02.553]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:06.156]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:08.897 --> 00:31:17.560]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.681]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:31:23.162 --> 00:31:27.783]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.
[00:31:28.203 --> 00:31:30.864]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today!
[00:31:31.064 --> 00:31:31.424]  I think so.

[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:14.285]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:32:14.585 --> 00:32:15.746]  Inner Health Botanicals.

[00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:27.737]  We're good to go.
[00:32:47.857 --> 00:32:50.038]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:32:50.278 --> 00:32:51.278]  And take it from me, folks.
[00:32:51.498 --> 00:32:52.539]  It really does taste great.

[00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.634]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[00:33:27.994 --> 00:33:28.855]  Ooh!
[00:33:29.576 --> 00:33:31.698]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:33:32.199 --> 00:33:33.821]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:33:34.702 --> 00:33:41.730]  And when the band plays, hell to the teeth, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.191]  Tell them!
[00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:59.668]  We are back, and we are joined by Dave Jordan of News9.com, the Oklahoma City NBC affiliate out of Little Rock, Arkansas.
[00:33:59.708 --> 00:34:01.789]  Wait, I guess, no, no, he previously worked there.
[00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:02.349]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:04.930]  I'm not sure what the affiliate is here.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.102]  Well, why don't you just, for starters, describe what happened outside of this video.
[00:34:10.122 --> 00:34:12.884]  In other words, what have you been able to surmise is the case?
[00:34:12.944 --> 00:34:15.165]  I mean, why was this woman going to the hospital?
[00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:17.326]  Why were these people pulled over in the first place?
[00:34:17.426 --> 00:34:23.029]  What happens before we get to see, I guess, the son take his cell phone camera and start documenting the event?
[00:34:23.289 --> 00:34:28.251]  Okay, well, before I say anything, I have to say that I'm with the CBS affiliate in Oklahoma City, KWTV.
[00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:29.732]  So let's get that out there.
[00:34:30.052 --> 00:34:30.252]  All right.
[00:34:30.692 --> 00:34:31.913]  We got a call on
[00:34:32.887 --> 00:34:37.431]  Memorial Day this past Monday from the gentleman who shot that video, Kenyatta Davis.
[00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:40.473]  He told me that his mother had suffered heat stroke.
[00:34:41.154 --> 00:34:51.703]  His mother lives in the town of Bowley, which is in another area of Oklahoma, and every weekend, every year, they have this rodeo that goes on, and he was with his mom, and they attended the rodeo.
[00:34:52.243 --> 00:34:56.087]  And he actually lives in Oklahoma City, but he was visiting with his mother, and he stayed the weekend.
[00:34:56.587 --> 00:35:01.291]  Well, his mom was doing some work outside of the house and suffered from a heat exhaustion, he told me.
[00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:09.635]  So they called an ambulance, which was run by the... they called 911, as you would expect, and the ambulance picked him up on the Creek Nation.
[00:35:09.655 --> 00:35:14.538]  It's the Creek Nation, the Indian tribe, which runs the ambulance services in that area.
[00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:23.045]  Well, they picked him up, and they picked up his mother, and they were riding to the emergency room in a nearby town called Prague, to the hospital.
[00:35:24.046 --> 00:35:30.811]  And what happens after that is a matter of debate between the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and
[00:35:31.792 --> 00:35:37.316]  The Davis family, but judging from what the Davis family told me, that's all I can pretty much tell you is what they told me.
[00:35:37.496 --> 00:35:41.299]  Alright, so from the perspective of the Davis family, how does this all occur?
[00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:44.842]  I mean, do we have any other eyewitnesses outside of the Davis family?
[00:35:44.862 --> 00:35:52.407]  Well, we did hear from some other eyewitnesses yesterday who pretty much confirmed the Davis family's version of events.
[00:35:52.948 --> 00:35:53.508]  Okay.
[00:35:53.828 --> 00:35:55.350]  And I'll tell you what those events are.
[00:35:55.370 --> 00:36:01.134]  They were riding down Highway 62 through a town called Payden.
[00:36:01.955 --> 00:36:05.096]  And they were not running hot, as they say.
[00:36:05.116 --> 00:36:06.937]  They did not have on their siren.
[00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:09.978]  They did not have on their lights.
[00:36:10.498 --> 00:36:17.641]  They were just driving down the road, which did not have a lot of traffic and was a winding road, as you would expect on a holiday weekend in a small town.
[00:36:18.681 --> 00:36:25.367]  And they said within a matter of seconds they saw an OHP trooper pull up next to them, just out of nowhere.
[00:36:25.407 --> 00:36:30.210]  The OHP trooper, according to the Davis family, was not running his hot either.
[00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.313]  They had the lights on, they didn't have the sirens on.
[00:36:33.933 --> 00:36:41.399]  So this trooper just got in his car, according to the Davis' then, drove up to the ambulance and on their way to a separate call.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.342]  They were responding to a call of a, I believe, stolen car.
[00:36:45.556 --> 00:36:50.880]  Then they called for backup and another ambulance came over, another, I'm sorry, OHP trooper car came over.
[00:36:51.721 --> 00:37:00.528]  And they got into an argument because the troopers believed that the ambulance did not yield to them so that they could respond to the call.
[00:37:01.638 --> 00:37:01.898]  Okay.
[00:37:02.078 --> 00:37:14.368]  The ambulance maintained, the paramedic maintained, Paul Frank was the one driving, and he said in a written statement that he did not hear them, and because of the trajectory of the road and how it was winding, he could not see them.
[00:37:14.448 --> 00:37:20.173]  He didn't know that they were driving up that quickly until after they had passed him, or when they approached him.
[00:37:20.653 --> 00:37:20.893]  Okay.
[00:37:20.913 --> 00:37:22.434]  So had he known that, he would have yielded.
[00:37:22.454 --> 00:37:23.115]  Okay.
[00:37:23.155 --> 00:37:30.841]  Well, the troopers went and dealt with their official business, and once that was concluded, they turned, or they stayed where they were, and when the ambulance was passing,
[00:37:31.656 --> 00:37:35.697]  They stopped them and pulled them over to ticket them for not yielding.
[00:37:36.537 --> 00:37:44.519]  The paramedics, the first one they dealt with was Paul, and he pretty much said, well, you know something, let's deal with this at the hospital.
[00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:46.780]  I have a patient in the back that is being treated.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.260]  We need to go to the hospital.
[00:37:49.721 --> 00:37:55.062]  He maintains that the trooper in question, his name I believe is Daniel Martin,
[00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:59.152]  She started yelling and said, you know, get your blank in my vehicle.
[00:37:59.172 --> 00:38:00.393]  I'm writing you a ticket now.
[00:38:00.753 --> 00:38:01.994]  This is ridiculous.
[00:38:02.154 --> 00:38:03.214]  Let's stop for a second.
[00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:04.675]  This is the, this is the driver.
[00:38:04.695 --> 00:38:07.116]  This is the older white gentleman with the glasses, correct?
[00:38:07.236 --> 00:38:07.476]  Right.
[00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:08.096]  Okay.
[00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:08.396]  Okay.
[00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:08.916]  Right.
[00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:11.698]  That's what he's saying is that is what happened.
[00:38:11.838 --> 00:38:20.741]  Now Kenyatta Davis was riding in the passenger side of the ambulance and saw all of this happen, saw them yelling and screaming.
[00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:22.382]  So he just stayed inside.
[00:38:23.075 --> 00:38:34.577]  Well, apparently, the other paramedic, that would be the black gentleman, his name is Maurice White, he came out of the car and said, listen, we have to go and get this patient treated to the hospital.
[00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:44.999]  And there was a mini-scuffle that occurred, according to OHP and according to him, where they tried to arrest him, and he said, no, you're not arresting me.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:52.061]  If you want to take this up, let's go to the hospital, and once we get this patient admitted, then you can do whatever you want to do.
[00:38:52.492 --> 00:38:56.833]  And now this is before the passenger, the son, starts filming it all.
[00:38:56.853 --> 00:38:58.354]  There's a scuffle before the filming begins.
[00:38:58.374 --> 00:39:00.835]  There's a scuffle before the filming that we have not seen.
[00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:05.136]  That apparently was recorded by Dash Cam Video, which I'll talk about in a few minutes.
[00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:07.116]  Okay.
[00:39:07.316 --> 00:39:09.877]  The driver is still outside the vehicle.
[00:39:10.057 --> 00:39:15.519]  Mr. White goes back in and begins working on Kenyatta's mother, you know, trying to get her up to speed.
[00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:22.221]  And at that point, Kenyatta comes out of the ambulance to see what's going on out of the passenger side of the ambulance to see what's going on.
[00:39:22.728 --> 00:39:25.310]  And they told him yet again, you know, we are, we're stopped.
[00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:26.270]  This is what's happening.
[00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.151]  This is what's going on.
[00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:31.093]  At that point, he pulled out his phone and he starts to record everything.
[00:39:31.614 --> 00:39:35.416]  He does a little introduction on the, on the raw video, which you could probably see.
[00:39:35.476 --> 00:39:37.417]  And he said, you know, this is me.
[00:39:37.937 --> 00:39:39.939]  OHP just pulled over my mother's ambulance.
[00:39:40.399 --> 00:39:44.862]  This is what she, because they said that we didn't pull over as we were trying to get her to the hospital.
[00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:47.904]  So I'm just going to record some video of what's going on.
[00:39:48.544 --> 00:39:50.005]  So once he recorded the video,
[00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:53.938]  That's all the video that you see from that point.
[00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:57.984]  That's what we reported, that's what he sent to us, and that's what we reported on.
[00:39:58.705 --> 00:40:05.555]  And then the ambulance, the OHP trooper tried to arrest Mr. White again for the second time, and that's when the scuffling
[00:40:06.226 --> 00:40:12.190]  And you know, in the video you see Mr. White actually telling Mr. Davis not to get involved.
[00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.111]  Yeah, not to get involved.
[00:40:13.171 --> 00:40:16.153]  It seems like he's waiting for cooler heads to prevail just to go.
[00:40:16.553 --> 00:40:22.037]  Now, before we get into, you know, what may or may not be on that tape, apparently from the police cam,
[00:40:22.997 --> 00:40:35.161]  Isn't there an apparatus out there where these police instead of pulling over this ambulance could have contacted the ambulance service or the hospital and asked if they were on call or you know if they were on an emergency call?
[00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:35.881]  Isn't there something there?
[00:40:36.181 --> 00:40:42.403]  Couldn't they have done something else other than pull these guys over in a failure to yield when they didn't apparently even have their sirens on?
[00:40:44.184 --> 00:40:50.299]  There is a situation where an ambulance is responding to something or a police officer is responding to something.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.287]  You can always verify whether there is a call in progress.
[00:40:53.905 --> 00:41:01.607]  You know, we may not in the media have that ability, but 911 and other emergency managers can always verify with each other whether there's a call in progress.
[00:41:02.227 --> 00:41:07.988]  And, you know, the failure to yield issue was never disputed by the paramedics.
[00:41:08.548 --> 00:41:12.289]  The paramedics said, you know, maybe we did fail to yield, but we did not see him.
[00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:14.649]  Had we seen him, we would have yielded.
[00:41:14.669 --> 00:41:18.170]  You know, and they were not denying anything happened.
[00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:22.091]  They were not denying that they were trying not to yield, which
[00:41:23.298 --> 00:41:24.780]  Both parties would probably doubt.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.844]  They just wanted the issue handled after the patient was admitted to the hospital.
[00:41:31.086 --> 00:41:41.936]  It seems like the guy is very frustrated even in the 20 or so seconds that he's talking to the officer before the physical altercation actually ensues and he does try to arrest him.
[00:41:41.996 --> 00:41:47.602]  I mean he literally does say you're under arrest two or three different times and it's when he tries to cuff him
[00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:52.503]  Well, I can tell you that when we heard about this in the newsroom, we got a call on Monday
[00:42:17.276 --> 00:42:21.679]  And if any of you guys have ever worked in news, you get calls from many people alleging different things.
[00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:24.740]  And when you start looking into the story, it's not always as it seems.
[00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:37.687]  And I was one of the reporters who drew the short straw and was working that Monday on Memorial Day and got the phone call from Mr. Davis, who explained his position and talked about what was going on and talked about what happened.
[00:42:38.208 --> 00:42:42.670]  And I told him, well, I'm not going to do the story today because I want to give OHP a chance to respond to this.
[00:42:43.643 --> 00:42:47.244]  And he said, oh, that's fine, I'm just going to email you some video.
[00:42:47.844 --> 00:42:54.125]  And he did, and I looked at it, and I looked at it again the next day, and I called him, and his version of events did not change.
[00:42:54.625 --> 00:43:10.708]  Now, I contacted OHP, and OHP said that, you know, they referred us to, well, let me just say, the PIO that I spoke with, the Public Information Officer, told me that there was some dash cam video that had been turned over to the
[00:43:12.372 --> 00:43:16.756]  District Attorney in the area where this all transpired, in Oklahoma County.
[00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:34.350]  The Assistant District Attorney, her name is Maxi Riley, I've been speaking with her for the past couple of days, and the first version that she told me, what she did tell me initially, was that the dash cam video shows Mr. White attacking the trooper.
[00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:43.449]  And, you know, and it recorded everything, soup to nuts, and Mr. White could be facing charges, and those charges could come down as early as this week.
[00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:50.451]  And I just checked about six minutes ago, and she told me there weren't no charges that were coming down yet.
[00:43:50.551 --> 00:43:54.612]  They have not filed, they have not made a decision on whether to file what was going on.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.120]  And are we going to be able to see this video?
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.861]  I mean, is it going to be to the point where you have to ask for an FOIA request?
[00:44:00.901 --> 00:44:03.441]  Are they going to voluntarily let the public see this?
[00:44:03.622 --> 00:44:10.363]  Well, they said that they are not going to release the video until after it goes to trial, or presumably after charges are handed down.
[00:44:10.523 --> 00:44:12.083]  So we've been talking back and forth.
[00:44:13.243 --> 00:44:17.024]  I was told that, you know, that's a decision that will come later on.
[00:44:17.744 --> 00:44:22.805]  But, you know, if there's dash cam video that supports the trooper's version of events,
[00:44:23.717 --> 00:44:27.901]  Clearly, that could go a long way towards being what actually transpired.
[00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:34.286]  Well, it really seems to me that if that were the case, we would have seen this trooper video by now, but I'll be shocked if that is the case.
[00:44:34.326 --> 00:44:40.891]  But again, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, although I'm not sure that the way that they acted, again, pulling over an ambulance, enables that.
[00:44:41.172 --> 00:44:42.533]  Let's talk about the troopers in general.
[00:44:42.753 --> 00:44:47.197]  Do any of these guys have any kind of a past history of complaints such as this?
[00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:51.160]  I mean, is this supposedly an isolated incident, or has this happened before?
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:45:05.369]  I've gotten a couple of calls that would suggest... Well, before I even go into that, I just want to say that Mr. Davis made it perfectly clear, or plainly clear to me, that there was only one trooper that was involved in this in terms of trying to arrest the paramedic.
[00:45:05.409 --> 00:45:09.532]  He said the other troopers who were on the scene were just trying to diffuse the situation.
[00:45:10.292 --> 00:45:15.295]  You know, he said there was one trooper that I called by name, Daniel Martin, who was the responding trooper.
[00:45:16.236 --> 00:45:20.759]  As of now, when I spoke with OHP, he's now the subject of an internal investigation.
[00:45:21.343 --> 00:45:21.463]  Okay.
[00:45:40.706 --> 00:45:44.849]  While that investigation goes on, or they would prevent him outright.
[00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:48.452]  Paid administrative leave is seen as a procedural type of thing.
[00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:51.674]  Prevention is seen more as a punishment or a reprimand.
[00:45:51.934 --> 00:45:53.015]  Well, what can you tell us about this?
[00:45:53.035 --> 00:45:53.995]  He hasn't done anything.
[00:45:54.296 --> 00:45:56.757]  Well, what can you tell us about this internal investigation?
[00:45:56.817 --> 00:45:59.199]  Are they at least telling you what he's being investigated for?
[00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:00.820]  What are some of these previous complaints?
[00:46:01.401 --> 00:46:07.245]  Well, the previous complaints, I haven't gotten any word back from OHP on the previous complaints I asked about that.
[00:46:08.072 --> 00:46:21.960]  They said that they're still looking into it and I don't know whether there's a procedural thing that goes on unless someone is, you know, charged with a crime or, you know, formally, you know, being investigated whether they release that information to the public.
[00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:36.669]  But I will tell you that I've gotten at least one other call from a paramedic for the same organization who alleges that someone stopped her, that same trooper stopped her vehicle while she was trying to transport a pregnant woman.
[00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:43.934]  So, wait a minute, this guy has a past of... this isn't the first time he's pulled over an ambulance and the other incident was with a pregnant woman?
[00:46:44.254 --> 00:46:51.456]  Well, that is one of the allegations that's being made from a paramedic who works in the same group.
[00:46:51.756 --> 00:46:54.217]  Now, from that allegation, I mean, was she ticketed?
[00:46:54.277 --> 00:46:54.998]  Was she detained?
[00:46:55.038 --> 00:46:55.758]  Was she stopped?
[00:46:55.778 --> 00:46:57.338]  Did she find this difficult?
[00:46:57.398 --> 00:47:01.780]  I mean, what's her... Well, I'm still working the story and trying to get all angles.
[00:47:02.578 --> 00:47:09.462]  Um, as far as what happened, um, you know, she called and left me a message and I spoke with her husband about this because he was, actually he was the one who called.
[00:47:10.102 --> 00:47:15.105]  So, I'm still trying to confirm that and I'm still trying to talk to, you know, the paramedics in question.
[00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:20.428]  But the paramedics were not, um, Mr. White and Mr. Frank have not been suspended either.
[00:47:20.488 --> 00:47:27.272]  According to the Creek Nation, they're still on duty, they're still paramedics, they're still working, working, um, on their shift.
[00:47:27.677 --> 00:47:31.460]  Now, now, does this guy have any kind of, like, relations?
[00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:33.902]  Is there a good ol' boy network out there?
[00:47:33.963 --> 00:47:45.333]  I mean, if this guy's under investigation, he's not on paid administrative leave at all, he's not on leave while he's being investigated, that seems to be, I mean, this seems like maybe it's a smaller community, people are afraid to speak up.
[00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:49.416]  Is that because there is this, you know, back, backwards network out there?
[00:47:49.436 --> 00:47:52.679]  I mean, does this guy have relatives, friends in the, uh,
[00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:56.633]  In the upper echelons of the city council, I mean, what's the deal here?
[00:47:56.653 --> 00:47:58.014]  Does he have any of those kind of connections?
[00:47:58.194 --> 00:48:02.577]  Well, from some of the viewers I heard from, there seems to be that perception that he's being protected.
[00:48:02.597 --> 00:48:15.224]  I don't know if, I can't say for certain whether the OHP is protecting them, but there is a judge in the county where this all happened who happens to have the last name of the same trooper.
[00:48:15.879 --> 00:48:17.399]  And I'm trying to make the connection there.
[00:48:17.439 --> 00:48:18.580]  I just spoke with the DA.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:24.001]  I asked if they were related, and she told me she didn't believe that they were, but I haven't been able to confirm that.
[00:48:24.021 --> 00:48:27.162]  Because, you know, again, we're still working the story.
[00:48:27.202 --> 00:48:28.663]  We're still trying to find out some stuff.
[00:48:28.843 --> 00:48:33.144]  I still would like to see the entire dash cam video of what transpired.
[00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:35.499]  Yeah, I think that's utterly necessary.
[00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:50.335]  I mean, we need to know what happened before, especially because, you know, the way that the video that I've seen, the gentleman in the back is trying to keep the coolest of heads, and it's not until, again, they try to arrest him, and he is the only EMS worker
[00:48:50.635 --> 00:48:50.955]  That's crazy!
[00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:17.753]  Well, and they said that's the reason they didn't arrest him, because there was a patient back there.
[00:49:18.453 --> 00:49:21.416]  But, you know, and they said that he could be arrested later on.
[00:49:21.516 --> 00:49:32.066]  And when I asked, well, why wasn't he arrested at the scene, they didn't want to arrest the paramedic because they said they didn't want to leave that area, which is a relatively small area, without a paramedic on duty.
[00:49:33.015 --> 00:49:37.479]  But that's kind of doublespeak because then they would have arrested him after he got to the hospital or charged him.
[00:49:37.499 --> 00:49:39.561]  Like you said, there have been no charges yet.
[00:49:39.901 --> 00:49:40.802]  And he hasn't been arrested yet.
[00:49:40.822 --> 00:49:42.524]  Yeah, and he hasn't been arrested yet.
[00:49:42.564 --> 00:49:47.929]  So it really, to me, seems like they're really trying to cover their own, you know, backsides, if you will.
[00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:51.112]  And this is just, to me, it was a really disgusting incident.
[00:49:51.332 --> 00:49:53.054]  These people are out there to save lives.
[00:49:53.594 --> 00:49:58.739]  This could have been dealt with with just a call, like you said, to the 911 operator to see if there was an emergency call.
[00:49:58.759 --> 00:50:05.966]  There was no reason to set up what you said was basically a roadblock after they had taken care of their call to have this incident ensue.
[00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:08.848]  And again, we only get to see part of the picture.
[00:50:09.169 --> 00:50:12.692]  And I would think that, you know, there are I think two or three cop cars on the scene.
[00:50:12.892 --> 00:50:14.594]  There should be more than one dash cam.
[00:50:15.795 --> 00:50:15.955]  Right.
[00:50:17.034 --> 00:50:20.095]  So, you know, I hope that you continue to pursue this story.
[00:50:20.155 --> 00:50:21.776]  You hit us up with any updates.
[00:50:21.796 --> 00:50:23.277]  I really thank you for your time, sir.
[00:50:23.637 --> 00:50:27.799]  And like I said, if you get anything more, if the dash cam is released, please give us an email.
[00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:28.639]  Please give us a call.
[00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:29.600]  We'd love to have you back on.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.620]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.662]  And I can tell you that this story has gone viral.
[00:50:35.802 --> 00:50:38.225]  We've gotten tons of calls from across the country.
[00:50:38.766 --> 00:50:40.808]  You know, it's been all over the cable news networks.
[00:50:40.828 --> 00:50:43.452]  I think it made it in at least one story on the network level.
[00:50:43.492 --> 00:50:47.357]  So it's definitely an issue people are going to be keeping a close eye on, myself included.
[00:50:48.095 --> 00:50:49.075]  All right, thank you so much.
[00:50:49.115 --> 00:50:55.137]  Dave Jordan, everybody, and the latest on that EMT versus Oklahoma PD incident.
[00:50:55.177 --> 00:51:02.280]  Really a disgusting incident, in my opinion, and a blight on the police force, and really the police state that is encroaching on us.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.300]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.820]  Back with your calls after this.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.261]  Alex, on the other side of the hour.
[00:51:09.398 --> 00:51:13.382]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[00:51:13.663 --> 00:51:17.787]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[00:51:18.067 --> 00:51:22.352]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[00:51:22.552 --> 00:51:28.779]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[00:51:29.299 --> 00:51:30.000]  We're good to go.
[00:51:44.056 --> 00:51:44.336]  I think so.
[00:52:08.905 --> 00:52:10.246]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:10.426 --> 00:52:15.411]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:52:15.791 --> 00:52:17.873]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:52:18.213 --> 00:52:27.161]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[00:52:27.281 --> 00:52:28.221]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.128 --> 00:52:52.408]  We're good.
[00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:15.950]  Due to recent events related to the H1N1 virus, the Center for Disease Control has issued a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.911]  What can you do to prepare yourself for potential airborne threats?

[00:54:20.512 --> 00:54:23.634]  Alright, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:23.694 --> 00:54:32.639]  Alex about to join us at the top of the hour.
[00:54:41.294 --> 00:54:54.145]  We're going to really be analyzing this latest Obama speech, the coming out party for Internet 2, for the Cyber Security Coordinator, for further DHS, NSA, CIA control of your life.
[00:54:55.046 --> 00:54:57.768]  An expansion of the Bush administration's policies.
[00:54:58.068 --> 00:54:58.989]  I promise you that.
[00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:00.711]  Alright, let's go to callers.
[00:55:00.751 --> 00:55:02.752]  Freeburger in Virginia, you're on the air.
[00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.555]  Uncle Burmess, what's up?
[00:55:06.435 --> 00:55:07.016]  How you doing, friend?
[00:55:07.659 --> 00:55:08.159]  Not too bad.
[00:55:08.339 --> 00:55:09.840]  Congratulations on being an uncle.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:10.820]  Oh, thank you.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.001]  I'm hoping to get back to New York shortly.
[00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:20.344]  Actually, my sister went back up there with the baby, so hopefully sometime in the next month I'm going to go get to meet the latest addition to the family.
[00:55:21.165 --> 00:55:21.565]  That's awesome.
[00:55:21.945 --> 00:55:26.687]  And I want to thank the Prison Planet crew for what they do, and thanks for taking my call.
[00:55:27.207 --> 00:55:27.647]  Oh, you got it.
[00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:31.949]  So, yeah, I wish I had been on the phone with Mr. Chapman.
[00:55:32.009 --> 00:55:34.610]  He's pretty reliable information.
[00:55:37.884 --> 00:55:45.151]  Yeah, I just wanted to give a shout out to the Reinhardt fellow who has the Enterprise Corruption website.
[00:55:46.232 --> 00:55:51.658]  He makes a lot of varied predictions, but you should check out his journal.
[00:55:51.738 --> 00:55:53.500]  It's pretty interesting.
[00:55:53.982 --> 00:56:05.555]  What do you think about this whole Obama speech about the new cyber security coordinator and all these hack attacks and how we have to regulate the internet and you know the cyber bullying bill and Miley Cyrus behind it.
[00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:15.185]  I mean it really does seem like a concerted effort to fast track even further enslavement and control of the internet and technology in general.
[00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:18.418]  That's pretty intense.
[00:56:18.678 --> 00:56:27.883]  It's too bad more people aren't informed to try to take action and call their local representatives to take care of that.
[00:56:28.404 --> 00:56:30.885]  Yeah, too many people just really do not see the bigger picture.
[00:56:30.925 --> 00:56:37.829]  And again, that's why it's so important that people go and get an endgame because it really does lay out a huge agenda in only two hours.
[00:56:37.869 --> 00:56:38.750]  I thank you for the call.
[00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.311]  Derek in Utah, you're online.
[00:56:41.471 --> 00:56:41.972]  Yes, Derek.
[00:56:43.413 --> 00:56:43.713]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:44.133 --> 00:56:45.214]  Hey, thank you.
[00:56:47.505 --> 00:56:54.228]  I noticed you guys are fighting the info war with the wrong tools in your servers there.
[00:56:54.368 --> 00:56:56.149]  I'm talking about tech-savvy people right now.
[00:56:56.889 --> 00:57:01.251]  And what you guys are using is magnetic disks in your servers, right?
[00:57:02.091 --> 00:57:03.812]  You know, I have no idea.
[00:57:04.492 --> 00:57:05.332]  I've got to be honest.
[00:57:05.372 --> 00:57:06.553]  I've got no idea.
[00:57:07.113 --> 00:57:07.513]  Go ahead.
[00:57:07.613 --> 00:57:14.516]  Well, you're using Newton's Law, and Newton knew about magnetism, and that's what those disks are based off of.
[00:57:15.151 --> 00:57:18.052]  And you've got to fight the info war with Moore's Law.
[00:57:18.833 --> 00:57:20.033]  And I'll give you a website.
[00:57:20.154 --> 00:57:24.816]  It's www.fusionio.com.
[00:57:25.496 --> 00:57:25.836]  Okay.
[00:57:25.936 --> 00:57:32.280]  And what they do is they accelerate storage and it's just going to be an awesome, awesome tool for you guys.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.281]  I heard Alex saying that his bandwidth was costing $10,000.
[00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:37.963]  It's quite a bit.
[00:57:37.983 --> 00:57:44.766]  You take that $10,000 and invest in a drive and your bandwidth is going to be amazing.
[00:57:45.632 --> 00:57:49.055]  All right, the tech guys are listening, so hopefully they can help you with it.
[00:57:49.095 --> 00:57:49.935]  Thanks for the call, Derek.
[00:57:49.975 --> 00:57:52.257]  Let's go to Manuel in California.
[00:57:52.297 --> 00:57:53.178]  Manuel, you're on the air.
[00:57:54.158 --> 00:57:55.099]  Hey, Jason.
[00:57:55.239 --> 00:57:56.140]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:01.003]  I just wanted to say a special thank you to all the 9-11 Truth people out there.
[00:58:02.385 --> 00:58:09.130]  You guys have a link on Prison Planet right now to an interview with Richard Gage about 9-11 Truth.
[00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:13.893]  I'm the producer that got him to come on to our TV show.
[00:58:14.133 --> 00:58:14.714]  Oh, excellent!
[00:58:15.475 --> 00:58:17.137]  The response has been phenomenal.
[00:58:30.948 --> 00:58:34.370]  I kind of reached onto that and got him on for an interview.
[00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:35.451]  And it was great.
[00:58:35.851 --> 00:58:37.332]  I had a good response to our team.
[00:58:37.372 --> 00:58:38.832]  Man, well, I've got Alex coming up.
[00:58:38.872 --> 00:58:40.353]  I wish I could have spent more time with you.
[00:58:40.393 --> 00:58:42.955]  And I thank you so much for helping us break into the mainstream.
[00:58:42.975 --> 00:58:44.515]  We'll be back with Alex Jones after this.
[00:58:44.556 --> 00:58:45.796]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:45.836 --> 00:58:49.938]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:51.319 --> 00:58:52.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:56.142]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[00:58:59.025 --> 00:59:04.026]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:59:04.226 --> 00:59:08.027]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:08.247 --> 00:59:13.849]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:14.149 --> 00:59:19.010]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:23.251]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:23.491 --> 00:59:25.553]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:59:25.573 --> 00:59:28.795]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[00:59:41.866 --> 00:59:43.166]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[00:59:43.406 --> 00:59:47.987]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:48.107 --> 00:59:49.668]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:49.888 --> 00:59:52.228]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:59:52.448 --> 00:59:56.369]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:03.850]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.071]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.457 --> 01:00:18.778]  Into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.798 --> 01:00:23.620]  Before Alex comes on, we're going to play the rest of that biometric SeaWorld clip.
[01:00:24.581 --> 01:00:26.882]  Really, you know, a man before his time.
[01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:31.664]  Really not before his time, right on time, in my opinion, you know.
[01:00:31.964 --> 01:00:37.767]  He's the one that really pioneered this fight in the info war, and, uh, you know, this is an old school clip.
[01:00:37.787 --> 01:00:39.988]  This is something you can't find on YouTube yet.
[01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:50.555]  And, uh, hopefully we're gonna do, like, a, uh, you know, backlash, or, uh, you know, an article, you know, look into the future with Alex Jones, because this was an important clip.
[01:00:50.635 --> 01:00:55.316]  This really does lay out the biometric control grid that they're now putting into place.
[01:00:55.376 --> 01:00:56.357]  I mean, this is it.
[01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.977]  So if we could hit the clip, Jaren, let's do it.
[01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:06.919]  Oh, I love my thumb scanner.
[01:01:07.319 --> 01:01:07.980]  Oh, it's so lovely.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.600]  Man, I'm so hungry.
[01:01:12.003 --> 01:01:12.764]  Oh, you're approved.
[01:01:13.985 --> 01:01:15.266]  Oh, you're approved too, sir.
[01:01:15.607 --> 01:01:20.371]  Come on in.
[01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.853]  Guys, you're being biometrically enrolled.
[01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:23.614]  Bad news.
[01:01:25.396 --> 01:01:27.057]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:32.823]  Hey, I guess you're not going to need these cameras anymore since the biometrics are going in, huh?
[01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:36.074]  You know the hand scan?
[01:01:36.614 --> 01:01:37.315]  When did that start?
[01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:38.976]  This season, I believe.
[01:01:39.356 --> 01:01:40.316]  And so no more photos?
[01:01:40.817 --> 01:01:43.838]  My photos are only for the two-day passes.
[01:01:43.858 --> 01:01:44.579]  Two-day passes.
[01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:47.100]  I wonder why you didn't just stay with photos.
[01:01:48.281 --> 01:01:49.501]  Why go to the biometrics?
[01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.282]  Just look at a photo.
[01:01:50.342 --> 01:01:52.083]  I don't know why I did that.
[01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:54.264]  Homeland Security.
[01:01:54.304 --> 01:01:55.545]  You said Homeland Security, sir?
[01:01:56.745 --> 01:02:01.047]  I got a family of four, so I'm going to take care of them.
[01:02:01.067 --> 01:02:01.208]  Yeah.
[01:02:02.472 --> 01:02:03.292]  I've got a family of four.
[01:02:03.332 --> 01:02:04.313]  What about you, Governor?
[01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:05.433]  For what?
[01:02:05.453 --> 01:02:06.274]  What did I do?
[01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:07.995]  For photos or for pencils?
[01:02:08.035 --> 01:02:08.855]  For passport, Michelle.
[01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.856]  I can help you out at the end there.
[01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:13.317]  Sir, you were saying Homeland Security?
[01:02:13.437 --> 01:02:14.658]  Who told you that?
[01:02:14.678 --> 01:02:16.158]  I want to give you my ticket.
[01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:17.339]  I'll come back in a little time.
[01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:26.136]  Okay, well, actually, this is what I research, this is what I do, and it is actually Homeland Security with the big corporations to get us used to this.
[01:02:27.057 --> 01:02:31.502]  HEB's putting in thumb scanners in Houston and College Station and some in Austin.
[01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.785]  Yeah, and everywhere you're going to have to thumb scan.
[01:02:33.845 --> 01:02:37.028]  Even when you pay cash, you have to face scan, thumb scan, or hand scan.
[01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:38.210]  When it happens, I want you to remember.
[01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:41.194]  Did you say that?
[01:02:41.555 --> 01:02:43.016]  It's a dictatorship, isn't it?
[01:02:43.116 --> 01:02:43.456]  It is.
[01:02:45.418 --> 01:02:46.159]  Say it for us loud.
[01:02:46.199 --> 01:02:50.502]  Dictatorship.
[01:02:50.562 --> 01:02:50.843]  That's it.
[01:02:50.963 --> 01:02:53.064]  It's supposed to be land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:02:53.785 --> 01:02:56.487]  No, but seriously, it's a federal plan to get everybody used to doing it.
[01:02:56.727 --> 01:02:59.670]  Then they can start a new national sales tax and go to a cashless society.
[01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:00.611]  No more money.
[01:03:00.831 --> 01:03:01.732]  You're going to scan.
[01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:03.974]  And I think we read about that somewhere.
[01:03:05.194 --> 01:03:07.958]  I think a couple thousand years ago they warned us about it.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.821]  But I guess it's here.
[01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:10.662]  I guess we're going to do it.
[01:03:10.682 --> 01:03:12.645]  Have you heard about that chip on the news?
[01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:13.887]  I think all the kids take that chip.
[01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.970]  You ever heard about the microchip?
[01:03:17.933 --> 01:03:19.095]  Alright, well have a good one.
[01:03:20.293 --> 01:03:21.494]  All right, let's pull the clip.
[01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:24.895]  I mean, you know, Alex Jones at some of his best work right there.
[01:03:24.915 --> 01:03:25.596]  You gotta love it.
[01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:32.079]  I mean, the dumbfounded look on these people with a polo shirt that says SeaWorld with Shamu weaved into it.
[01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:35.260]  Just the drool coming down the side.
[01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:37.061]  We don't get the bigger picture.
[01:03:37.462 --> 01:03:38.022]  We're idiots.
[01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:41.805]  We're the American populace, and I'm sorry if that's hard for you to hear.
[01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:43.827]  I'm a big moron too, folks.
[01:03:43.927 --> 01:03:44.307]  It's true.
[01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:46.329]  I've bought into the pop culture scenarios.
[01:03:46.409 --> 01:03:47.850]  I care who wins the playoffs.
[01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.293]  You know, I watch... I listen to Howard Stern, for God's sakes.
[01:03:51.513 --> 01:03:56.517]  You know, I am sucked into the entertainment world, too, but, you know, I take some time off from that.
[01:03:56.777 --> 01:04:03.643]  I would say, you know, 95% of my time off from that, that mindless droning, that x-boxing, that weeing.
[01:04:04.064 --> 01:04:04.704]  Ooh, PS3!
[01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:16.289]  I mean, I do take some time off to that for the real world, for reality, to report to you that the Supreme Court is making Orwellian decisions that are taking away your Miranda rights any way they slice it.
[01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:23.792]  Oh, well, if you invoke the right to a lawyer, you're okay, unless it's a certain circumstance where we're beating the snot out of you and coercing a...
[01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:26.034]  A confession.
[01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:27.816]  I mean, it's insanity.
[01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:37.606]  And coming up after this, if we don't have Jones on the line yet, we're going to start playing this Barack Obama speech where it's all about, oh, we're only a Web 2.0.
[01:04:38.607 --> 01:04:39.689]  We need a new age.
[01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:42.291]  We've got to track, trace, and database everything.
[01:04:43.143 --> 01:04:44.584]  It's the smart grid system.
[01:04:45.004 --> 01:04:48.486]  We want all your medical information to be digitized because we love you.
[01:04:49.227 --> 01:04:50.167]  We love you so much.
[01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:53.789]  Meanwhile, we have edible RFIDs on the shelf.
[01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:55.270]  Yes, edible RFID tags.
[01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.471]  We covered it yesterday, folks.
[01:04:56.831 --> 01:04:57.371]  Just Google it.
[01:04:57.391 --> 01:04:58.192]  We'll be back after this.
[01:04:58.492 --> 01:04:59.573]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:59.613 --> 01:05:03.375]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and TruthNews.us.
[01:05:09.164 --> 01:05:10.725]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:15.510]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:18.352]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:05:18.552 --> 01:05:21.435]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:05:21.615 --> 01:05:26.319]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:05:26.539 --> 01:05:27.460]  If you simply prepare.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.663]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:30.923 --> 01:05:37.809]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[01:07:09.961 --> 01:07:13.446]  Going into battle, you would want all the ammunition for your gun you could get.
[01:07:13.646 --> 01:07:16.870]  But presently, ammunition and reloading supplies are in shortage.
[01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:18.092]  Now think about this.
[01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:24.400]  If you have no food, all the guns and ammunition will be useless against the population control breadlines.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.784]  In the present battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[01:07:29.482 --> 01:07:29.922]  I think so.
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:50.860]  Big Brother!
[01:08:15.209 --> 01:08:16.250]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:18.091]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:18.731 --> 01:08:19.552]  You want answers?
[01:08:20.312 --> 01:08:21.253]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.873 --> 01:08:25.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.055 --> 01:08:30.098]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.562 --> 01:08:43.527]  Alex Jones now joins us to discuss the latest in not only this cyber security guard and Obama speech, but the latest news on this cop attacking an EMS worker.
[01:08:43.727 --> 01:08:46.448]  You know, he's under internal investigation right now.
[01:08:46.868 --> 01:08:49.449]  He does seem to be part of this back alley.
[01:08:50.089 --> 01:09:02.694]  Good ol' boys network and we know that there are at least two cameras that caught this, two of the police officer dash cams that they're not releasing and they're saying, oh we're waiting for this to go to trial or charges to be filed, yet they didn't arrest this guy!
[01:09:02.854 --> 01:09:06.336]  There aren't any charges to be filed because he didn't do anything Alex.
[01:09:07.996 --> 01:09:19.461]  Absolutely, that's what's so atrocious about this story is that witnesses are all over the news saying that the ambulance couldn't get traffic to move out of the way, the police wanted to go somewhere as well,
[01:09:20.202 --> 01:09:28.209]  So the police began violently getting right on the tail of the ambulance and then shot around the ambulance on the shoulder.
[01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:40.459]  And then later when they were done with whatever business it was that they never said, so it must not have been very important, they then chase the ambulance back down, jump out, get in the driver's face, scream and yell at him.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:42.901]  He submits.
[01:09:43.702 --> 01:09:45.283]  And then they go and open up the back.
[01:09:46.221 --> 01:09:54.127]  Acting like mad dogs, because once they do wrong, they have to legitimize it by saying you're bad, beating you up, falsely charging you, doing something.
[01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:56.609]  It's like when they beat you up after they shoot you in the back.
[01:09:56.989 --> 01:10:00.151]  I see this time, or after they break pro-lifers' arms, they then beat them up.
[01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:03.814]  It's not enough to savagely compound fracture them.
[01:10:04.154 --> 01:10:06.436]  It's got to continue, and I have footage of all of this.
[01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:12.380]  People peacefully sitting on the side of the sidewalk, and this is happening, and I know most police
[01:10:12.799 --> 01:10:18.421]  And I've seen him commenting on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and in the articles that Steve Watson wrote and the Curt Nemo posted.
[01:10:19.902 --> 01:10:26.725]  I've seen him saying, well, yes, we're not trained to choke people, and we're not trained to act like that, and you know, that guy should probably get in trouble, but don't think this is all of us.
[01:10:27.285 --> 01:10:30.707]  You know, the issue is, every time stuff like this happens, the police defend.
[01:10:31.747 --> 01:10:37.069]  The police defend the bad cops that do this, so that makes the entire system bad.
[01:10:37.089 --> 01:10:38.950]  And look, Oklahoma is legendary.
[01:10:39.654 --> 01:10:41.375]  I don't vacation in Oklahoma.
[01:10:41.395 --> 01:10:50.200]  They have great people up there, but I don't vacation in Oklahoma because of how many friends and family I've had shaken down by the police, beat up by the police.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:56.303]  I mean, if you're going one mile over the speed limit in Oklahoma, many of these rural state police and others will.
[01:10:56.743 --> 01:10:58.664]  It's almost like Mexican police in Mexico.
[01:10:58.724 --> 01:11:00.985]  And see, I mean, everybody knows they're corrupt down there.
[01:11:01.046 --> 01:11:02.927]  We're getting to be known like this here.
[01:11:04.287 --> 01:11:05.528]  And so the incredible thing is,
[01:11:06.573 --> 01:11:17.775]  They told local news stations that I read on your show last night, 9 to midnight, so there's no sense in going back over them today, but we posted links to them yesterday, that, oh, there was a fight.
[01:11:18.595 --> 01:11:20.835]  Oh, the paramedic and the policeman got in a fight.
[01:11:21.136 --> 01:11:22.436]  Well, why was the car pulled over?
[01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:23.856]  Why is it being called a fight?
[01:11:23.936 --> 01:11:24.656]  He does nothing.
[01:11:24.696 --> 01:11:30.857]  The cop is attacking him, shoving him, pushing him, grabs him by the arms, starts twisting him behind his back for no reason.
[01:11:31.757 --> 01:11:33.098]  The guy pulls his arm away.
[01:11:33.598 --> 01:11:35.438]  That is the assault of the God creature.
[01:11:36.323 --> 01:11:39.284]  Okay, so this is the mental illness.
[01:11:39.324 --> 01:11:42.665]  So he was the guy in the back of the ambulance.
[01:11:42.705 --> 01:11:46.025]  He was the attending emergency medical person.
[01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:54.328]  And so then the police go to the news and say, well, they'd been in a fight before that, before the cameras were turned on.
[01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:57.228]  So I mean, just insane.
[01:11:57.248 --> 01:12:00.729]  But now eyewitnesses are saying, no, everything you see on the tape is basically what happened.
[01:12:01.549 --> 01:12:03.850]  And that's why the police realize
[01:12:05.174 --> 01:12:09.535]  In their moment of guilt, which just shows they're mad dog out of control.
[01:12:09.555 --> 01:12:10.535]  They're not even really evil.
[01:12:10.555 --> 01:12:12.836]  They're just out of their minds on a power trip.
[01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:19.077]  That's why they finally, after they choke the guy, and he sits there and controls himself and lets them torture him.
[01:12:19.157 --> 01:12:20.317]  Literally, that's what torture is.
[01:12:21.277 --> 01:12:26.638]  They then kind of shake themselves out of it and leave, but then they come back and say, well, we're probably going to charge you later.
[01:12:26.678 --> 01:12:27.819]  Get ready for an indictment.
[01:12:27.839 --> 01:12:28.779]  Get ready for a warrant.
[01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:30.359]  You know, don't leave town.
[01:12:31.419 --> 01:12:33.360]  It's time to admit you're not gods.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.300]  I'm not a god.
[01:12:34.969 --> 01:12:36.790]  I put my pants on one leg at a time.
[01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:37.631]  I make mistakes.
[01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:38.211]  I'm wrong.
[01:12:38.652 --> 01:12:39.892]  I've been young and hot-headed.
[01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:47.477]  You know, I don't go around road-raging, but when I was younger, when people would road-rage me, I'd jump out of the car and say, let's go.
[01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:50.800]  And a few times, it got bloody.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:58.625]  Well, now I just know how to say, yep, you're tough, that's right, and I'll even run from somebody, because I've got work to do.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.083]  I'd love to jump out of the car and start kicking their teeth in, because I'm a human being.
[01:13:03.103 --> 01:13:03.883]  I got red blood.
[01:13:04.244 --> 01:13:06.525]  It's actually fun at a certain level, at an animal level.
[01:13:06.846 --> 01:13:08.527]  But I have a wife and children to take care of.
[01:13:08.987 --> 01:13:10.248]  I have a mission to complete.
[01:13:10.549 --> 01:13:16.593]  And I will only open a can of Whoop-Ass if I have to protect myself or protect somebody else, and I'm 100% in the right.
[01:13:17.014 --> 01:13:18.315]  I'm not looking for a fight.
[01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:26.000]  And old-fashioned lawmen or peace officers weren't looking for fights.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.163]  But I'll tell you this, when they had to charge up the UT Tower,
[01:13:30.054 --> 01:13:34.797]  They didn't cower for three or four hours like they always do now, waiting for federal orders and backup.
[01:13:35.097 --> 01:13:40.540]  They didn't need a bunch of fancy gear because they had testicles, and I'm sorry to use that term, but that's what it comes down to.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:48.064]  You know, the more gear, the more crud, the more, you know, supposed tactical training, all of this stuff is a joke.
[01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:58.549]  I've talked to a lot of old police, a lot of old retired police about the stories about the things they did without all this gear, without all this crud, and the truth is they've made the police be against the people.
[01:13:58.589 --> 01:13:59.670]  They have turned them against us.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:12.185]  They have trained them, that they're all under incredible danger, where I've seen cops approaching women, old women in convertibles, on 360, you know, highway, like they're approaching Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:12.906 --> 01:14:27.812]  And they are scared to death of everything, they think we're the enemy, they think we're out to kill them, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they get more and more abusive, we're going to start getting more and more abusive, and the trust is gone, and everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[01:14:28.365 --> 01:14:29.446]  We are all Americans.
[01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.606]  We live in the same country.
[01:14:30.946 --> 01:14:33.288]  This country is going down the tubes in a police state.
[01:14:34.568 --> 01:14:41.592]  And the sick part is that the media would come out and try to call this a fight and try to spin this and then let the police sit there with no evidence.
[01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:45.034]  And you better believe they would have released this Dash video if they had proof.
[01:14:46.234 --> 01:14:47.555]  And, you know, it's all there.
[01:14:48.535 --> 01:14:53.218]  The EMT is in the back trying to attend to the lady and they're telling him, stop, stop what you're doing.
[01:14:53.238 --> 01:14:55.199]  And he's got boxes of equipment.
[01:14:55.723 --> 01:14:57.604]  And he just says, what's your problem?
[01:14:57.644 --> 01:14:58.304]  I'm doing my job.
[01:14:58.324 --> 01:14:58.885]  Get out of my way.
[01:14:59.445 --> 01:15:00.525]  And it's about a power trip.
[01:15:00.565 --> 01:15:06.148]  Instead of the cop getting control of his ego and going, my God, I've got an ambulance pulled over because they didn't get out of my way.
[01:15:06.288 --> 01:15:07.249]  I'm on an ego trip.
[01:15:07.889 --> 01:15:09.070]  These guys are professionals.
[01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:13.792]  They've had to pass state laws and federal laws to leave ambulances alone.
[01:15:14.332 --> 01:15:16.053]  I've been reading an email in the comments.
[01:15:16.494 --> 01:15:18.034]  We've had scores of EMTs.
[01:15:18.074 --> 01:15:19.275]  I mean, probably more than 50.
[01:15:20.035 --> 01:15:20.476]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:20.536 --> 01:15:22.016]  Cops were pulling us over in Denver.
[01:15:22.036 --> 01:15:23.377]  Cops were pulling us over in Dallas.
[01:15:23.757 --> 01:15:25.298]  Cops were pulling us over in New York.
[01:15:25.717 --> 01:15:30.298]  And telling us we couldn't speed, and... There's no even law saying that.
[01:15:30.498 --> 01:15:32.339]  Well, actually, as revealed... They're crazy!
[01:15:32.559 --> 01:15:42.462]  Yeah, as revealed by Dave Jordan, the cop that, you know, was the main guy in this incident, that now is being internally investigated, also had pulled over an ambulance that contained a pregnant woman.
[01:15:42.502 --> 01:15:43.522]  So this is his M.O.
[01:15:43.562 --> 01:15:46.143]  This isn't the first time he's even pulled over an ambulance, Alex.
[01:15:46.423 --> 01:15:48.104]  Yeah, he's obviously some kind of lunatic.
[01:15:48.464 --> 01:15:51.865]  And see, instead of in the past, they would just kick lunatics out of the police force.
[01:15:53.005 --> 01:15:55.486]  Listen, I know a fella, manager of a Home Depot,
[01:15:56.314 --> 01:15:57.235]  He's been on the show before.
[01:15:57.315 --> 01:15:58.116]  Nice clean cut.
[01:15:59.036 --> 01:15:59.957]  No criminal record.
[01:16:00.498 --> 01:16:01.979]  Paralyzed from the chest down.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.904]  And the cop pulls him over and says, what is this?
[01:16:07.944 --> 01:16:09.705]  And he goes, these are my hand controls.
[01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:11.106]  And he said, get out of the car.
[01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:15.650]  And he said, officer, OK, my wife's got to get my wheelchair out of the back.
[01:16:15.690 --> 01:16:16.651]  And he said, you liar.
[01:16:16.671 --> 01:16:17.492]  There's nothing wrong with you.
[01:16:17.792 --> 01:16:18.873]  He said, I should get out now.
[01:16:19.293 --> 01:16:20.514]  So the guy starts trying to get out.
[01:16:20.554 --> 01:16:22.616]  He grabs him out, beats him up.
[01:16:22.636 --> 01:16:23.577]  This guy tried to sue him.
[01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:29.634]  And the cop got promoted to a supervisor commander level in Austin.
[01:16:29.674 --> 01:16:30.715]  He's a huge right head.
[01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:32.696]  And that's who they want.
[01:16:32.736 --> 01:16:35.278]  They go, oh, you beat up a guy who's paralyzed.
[01:16:35.738 --> 01:16:36.779]  You're the guy we want.
[01:16:37.099 --> 01:16:38.460]  You're the guy that'll follow orders.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.201]  You're the guy, I mean, this is who they want.
[01:16:41.662 --> 01:16:43.102]  This is who they want.
[01:16:43.122 --> 01:16:48.265]  I mean, and look, people may think it's cool to beat up somebody who's paralyzed because they don't walk when you order them to.
[01:16:48.285 --> 01:16:52.348]  And the mental illness is you didn't learn to, you know,
[01:16:52.992 --> 01:16:53.452]  I don't know.
[01:17:10.077 --> 01:17:28.406]  And so that's why we're seeing every day, I see an article about a paralyzed person, a retarded person, an autistic person, beat up or killed by the police, because there'll be some, you know, 16-year-old retarded kid wandering around in Canada or England or the U.S., you know, I see this story every few days, and the cops walk up and say, who are you?
[01:17:28.446 --> 01:17:31.427]  You know, some tattletale Nazi neighbor calls in and says, there's a weird person.
[01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:33.833]  And they can't talk and they go, boo, boo, boo.
[01:17:34.113 --> 01:17:36.254]  The cop goes, alright, pal, get on the ground.
[01:17:36.574 --> 01:17:37.795]  They don't do it, they taser him.
[01:17:37.835 --> 01:17:39.956]  The person gets up, scared, starts running.
[01:17:39.976 --> 01:17:41.837]  The cop crawls down, guns him down.
[01:17:44.078 --> 01:17:45.539]  These are real stories, folks.
[01:17:45.919 --> 01:17:48.680]  The associates show up and say, well, the officer felt threatened.
[01:17:49.441 --> 01:17:50.641]  This is mental illness.
[01:17:51.221 --> 01:17:54.663]  That they can't have more control of themselves.
[01:17:54.743 --> 01:17:59.385]  Being a man means that you're in control of yourself and don't care about your ego.
[01:18:01.305 --> 01:18:06.936]  You know, that's why cops have such a problem with alcoholism, drug abuse, the highest rate of divorce, the highest rate of suicide.
[01:18:07.277 --> 01:18:11.084]  Because in their own personal lives, this attitude... I mean, my God.
[01:18:11.886 --> 01:18:13.549]  I got natural testosterone.
[01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:17.236]  And I have to control myself looking for a fight all the time.
[01:18:17.316 --> 01:18:19.918]  I mean, I want to attack people all the time, because I'm a man.
[01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:22.320]  But the point is, I mean, I want to get in fights.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.585]  I hope some big guy starts a fight with me on a subconscious level, because I am a killer ape, as they say.
[01:18:27.925 --> 01:18:31.008]  But the issue is, I've got too much testosterone.
[01:18:31.028 --> 01:18:33.930]  That's why I'm almost scared to be getting in shape right now, because I get more aggressive.
[01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:39.635]  Can you imagine that 30 plus percent of police, they admit, federal statistics, are on hardcore steroids?
[01:18:39.875 --> 01:18:45.916]  Can you imagine wanting more artificial steroids in you than what you have naturally in you?
[01:18:46.056 --> 01:18:48.577]  As if cops need this to be tough?
[01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:52.577]  Look, if you think you need steroids to be a tough guy, you shouldn't be a cop.
[01:18:53.117 --> 01:18:53.337]  Okay?
[01:18:53.357 --> 01:18:56.758]  If you were really a tough guy, you'd be scared of what you'd do to somebody.
[01:18:56.778 --> 01:18:58.478]  And I speak from experience.
[01:18:58.538 --> 01:19:01.779]  I don't claim to be some tough guy, because I've had my butt kicked plenty of times.
[01:19:01.799 --> 01:19:03.119]  There's a lot of tough guys out there.
[01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:04.879]  But, you know, look.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.000]  Look, all I'm saying is, you can kill people, punch them once.
[01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:12.329]  And people need to understand out there that the police are mentally out of control.
[01:19:12.349 --> 01:19:13.809]  But Burmese, I'm ranting.
[01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:17.271]  I want to get into the cyber security federal takeover.
[01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:20.472]  When we get back, I want to cover some economic news and then get out of here.
[01:19:20.732 --> 01:19:24.214]  The last 20 minutes or so of the show so you can take some phone calls.
[01:19:24.734 --> 01:19:28.015]  But yeah, three months ago, we need a big article on this.
[01:19:28.035 --> 01:19:35.758]  Three months ago, the cyber security chief, people just search engine, head of cyber security quits, says democracy threatened.
[01:19:35.798 --> 01:19:36.899]  That's a little term he uses.
[01:19:37.329 --> 01:19:47.333]  And if you read what the head of cyber security said that Obama appointed, he said, the Pentagon and NORTHCOM are taking over the entire telecommunications system of the United States.
[01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:48.474]  This is a takeover.
[01:19:49.354 --> 01:19:53.175]  And so we need to break down what life will be like under the slave grid.
[01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:54.316]  Absolutely.
[01:19:54.336 --> 01:19:56.617]  We'll be back after this with Alex Jones.
[01:19:56.637 --> 01:20:02.479]  And we've also got the Obama speech on this new cyber security advisor and office.
[01:20:02.599 --> 01:20:04.100]  After this, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.361]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:20:09.844 --> 01:20:15.327]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:20:15.367 --> 01:20:15.887]  and the world.
[01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:19.609]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:20:20.029 --> 01:20:26.253]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:20:26.533 --> 01:20:28.314]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:20:28.554 --> 01:20:36.498]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:20:36.778 --> 01:20:41.205]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:20:41.485 --> 01:20:47.014]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:20:47.295 --> 01:20:49.298]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:51.722]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:20:52.062 --> 01:20:52.402]  We're good to go.
[01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:12.128]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:21:12.508 --> 01:21:18.473]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[01:21:46.855 --> 01:21:50.578]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:15.115 --> 01:22:20.458]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:20.999 --> 01:22:27.182]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:27.503 --> 01:22:29.324]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:29.464 --> 01:22:31.845]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:31.925 --> 01:22:42.812]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:45.114 --> 01:22:46.375]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:46.775 --> 01:22:48.176]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:48.637 --> 01:22:54.961]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:55.541 --> 01:23:03.327]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:03.807 --> 01:23:04.948]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:05.388 --> 01:23:06.569]  The people strike back.
[01:23:08.436 --> 01:23:11.398]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:23:11.538 --> 01:23:16.781]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:23:17.061 --> 01:23:22.404]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:23.905]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:33.171]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:23:33.571 --> 01:23:35.193]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:23:35.413 --> 01:23:39.578]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.178]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:24:15.476 --> 01:24:25.721]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade.
[01:24:27.742 --> 01:24:31.044]  And though the news was rather sad,
[01:24:32.304 --> 01:24:32.925]  We are back.
[01:24:32.965 --> 01:24:34.006]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:36.569]  Of course, joining us is Alex Jones.
[01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:46.042]  And we're talking cyber security from the Cyber Bullying Act, which is just totally and completely being promoted by the media to the youth through Hannah Montana.
[01:24:46.322 --> 01:24:50.087]  And of course, the Cyber Security Act, which is being promoted by Jay Rockefeller.
[01:24:50.407 --> 01:24:54.369]  Yeah, that was like seven years ago, but none of this is... I don't deserve the credit for knowing about this.
[01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.290]  This has been all on record.
[01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:27.494]  MIT, the CIA, the Defense Department were writing 20 years ago, you'll be digital face scanned, thumb printed to buy and sell.
[01:25:28.214 --> 01:25:39.079]  There'll be a global sales tax, there'll be a global carbon credit tax, and that it's designed to categorize everything we do, everywhere we go, to create a psychological algorithm.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.081]  When you eat too much beef, you'll be given a special tax, because it's all going to be on your record.
[01:25:44.262 --> 01:25:48.244]  When you drink, it'll be put on your record, but then when you weigh too much,
[01:25:48.698 --> 01:26:03.150]  Already in Japan, I saw the article last week, bureaucrats come around, social services, all adults must be weighed by the government, and then they fine and fee you and make you go to these prison workout centers to be exercised.
[01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:06.953]  This is the nanny state, but it's to carry out eugenics.
[01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:14.219]  That's why they want a social welfare system with a socialized healthcare, so when you have a heart attack, they give you an aspirin.
[01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:15.860]  Or when you have a brain tumor, you wait 18 months.
[01:26:16.792 --> 01:26:19.975]  When it would have been operable in two months and you die 100% of the time.
[01:26:20.235 --> 01:26:24.719]  Let's talk about that for just a second Alex because you know last night I'm up really late it's like 3 a.m.
[01:26:24.759 --> 01:26:40.432]  but I'm watching the CBS national news feed and lo and behold there's a story out of Austin and they're talking to this you know realtor this woman who's a single mother of two and she's saying oh it's so hard we had to give up our medical insurance but don't worry the new medical vans are coming around town
[01:26:40.672 --> 01:26:42.553]  And that's where I take my children now.
[01:26:42.853 --> 01:26:55.998]  It used to be just for lower-income families, but since we all have to sacrifice, we're going to have to use these mobile medical vans where they're basically going to give you the delicious vaccinations and drugs that just dumb you down and enslave you.
[01:26:56.158 --> 01:26:57.058]  Let me break that down.
[01:26:57.258 --> 01:27:02.260]  You know, I kept telling people the FEMA camps are going to be a place you've got to go.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.161]  It's not going to be, oh, here's the deadly FEMA camp.
[01:27:05.201 --> 01:27:08.322]  If you read the FEMA camp bill, everything in it is already built.
[01:27:08.782 --> 01:27:10.323]  It's just codifying it into law.
[01:27:10.785 --> 01:27:14.989]  You'll have over a hundred small camps, six big regional camps.
[01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:16.610]  Every city has it.
[01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:18.231]  Robert Mueller has part of it built.
[01:27:19.172 --> 01:27:21.574]  The Highland Mall has part of the FEMA Center in it now.
[01:27:22.194 --> 01:27:24.336]  And poor Austinites can't even go look at it for themselves.
[01:27:24.356 --> 01:27:25.577]  They just say, no, it's not true.
[01:27:26.098 --> 01:27:27.419]  But the point is, they're going to have it.
[01:27:27.499 --> 01:27:31.722]  As you said, this was on national news, but with Austin, the mobile vans.
[01:27:33.043 --> 01:27:38.188]  And they already have this for Head Start, where they come and say, all your kids are abused.
[01:27:38.288 --> 01:27:39.729]  They drill out the wrong teeth.
[01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:51.745]  Because they get more federal money for the more medical stuff they do, and they're going to have medical centers on these FEMA centers, and trailers and tents, and people are going to want to live in them.
[01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:55.768]  But even if you want to live under a bridge or in the woods, they're going to make you go to them.
[01:27:56.849 --> 01:27:59.051]  I know what's going to happen, but it's all stated.
[01:27:59.591 --> 01:28:03.454]  And that's why I started in Hawaii and California, and we sent a camera crew there a month ago.
[01:28:03.474 --> 01:28:04.695]  It's going to be in the new Obama film.
[01:28:06.621 --> 01:28:12.442]  That's why when I get on the air and I say, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot articulate to you how fast it's moving, how serious it is.
[01:28:12.502 --> 01:28:13.302]  I mean, here's one right here.
[01:28:13.342 --> 01:28:16.183]  Obama demands a right to recruit minors for military.
[01:28:16.823 --> 01:28:28.465]  Because people don't want their five, six, seven-year-olds having recruiters in the schools, federally, in all school districts, brainwashing the kids to join the military and having them sign agreements to join.
[01:28:28.725 --> 01:28:30.625]  They tell them, you'll be arrested if you don't.
[01:28:31.845 --> 01:28:32.786]  When it's not the law.
[01:28:33.126 --> 01:28:35.366]  But see, they say you'll be arrested if you don't take vaccines.
[01:28:35.836 --> 01:28:39.039]  They say you'll be arrested if you yell at your kids now when it's not even the law.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.861]  This is the system.
[01:28:41.481 --> 01:28:58.918]  This is a scientific tyranny, and yes, the Cyber Security Command, and yes, now that I'm down here, you know, taking a few days off, I'm watching more TV, Hannah Montana, that Cyrus demon, and her father, they are everywhere saying, turn your guns in.
[01:28:59.848 --> 01:29:04.052]  We need to ban the First Amendment because it makes kids commit suicide.
[01:29:04.412 --> 01:29:06.794]  Cyberbullying, which openly bans all free speech.
[01:29:06.834 --> 01:29:08.075]  I mean, openly bans it all.
[01:29:08.356 --> 01:29:11.378]  Federal felonies for any free speech that hurts someone's feelings.
[01:29:12.019 --> 01:29:14.341]  We've got to pass the Cybersecurity Command.
[01:29:14.661 --> 01:29:16.263]  This is an operation.
[01:29:16.323 --> 01:29:17.564]  I did do the research, by the way.
[01:29:17.604 --> 01:29:18.304]  It is confirmed.
[01:29:19.165 --> 01:29:22.148]  His whole family are in military intelligence and black ops.
[01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:24.930]  So this is definitely a giant sign-off.
[01:29:26.147 --> 01:29:27.288]  How do you argue with that?
[01:29:27.549 --> 01:29:42.385]  You know, your 10-year-old girl is allowed to watch TV, she watches the brainwashing, she wants to do what Hannah Montana is saying, and it's all about how she's going to be a movie star if she just believes in Hannah Montana to destroy her morals, to take her away from your family.
[01:29:42.665 --> 01:29:44.087]  And the boys are doing the same thing.
[01:29:44.387 --> 01:29:46.029]  Folks, we have to come out of Babylon.
[01:29:46.772 --> 01:29:50.896]  We have to disconnect ourselves from the Matrix now before it's too late.
[01:29:50.956 --> 01:29:52.678]  We are under full assault.
[01:29:53.519 --> 01:29:56.321]  Absolutely, it's not just about a backpack and a concert.
[01:29:56.361 --> 01:29:59.264]  It's about an agenda, a globalist agenda.
[01:29:59.404 --> 01:30:02.347]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.288 --> 01:30:05.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.238 --> 01:30:10.759]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:12.400]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.922]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:30:15.362 --> 01:30:20.105]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:30:20.506 --> 01:30:23.347]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:30:23.688 --> 01:30:27.210]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:30:27.583 --> 01:30:39.590]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:42.132]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:30:42.152 --> 01:30:43.452]  I use one every day.
[01:30:43.873 --> 01:30:46.314]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.276]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:31:12.887 --> 01:31:14.989]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:15.489 --> 01:31:22.516]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:23.064 --> 01:31:29.289]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:31.511]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:34.053]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:34.133 --> 01:31:45.102]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:45.722 --> 01:31:47.003]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:47.404 --> 01:31:48.745]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:49.241 --> 01:31:55.589]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:56.149 --> 01:32:03.939]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:04.419 --> 01:32:05.561]  The Obama Deception.
[01:32:06.001 --> 01:32:07.183]  The people strike back.
[01:32:09.147 --> 01:32:15.973]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:32:16.273 --> 01:32:32.167]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:32:32.467 --> 01:32:37.632]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:44.118]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:48.002]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:50.845]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:32:50.945 --> 01:32:56.310]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:32:56.610 --> 01:32:59.211]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:01.492]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:33:01.512 --> 01:33:03.953]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:33:04.013 --> 01:33:08.374]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:33:13.636 --> 01:33:14.256]  We are back.
[01:33:14.316 --> 01:33:15.496]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.716 --> 01:33:22.119]  We are, of course, joined by the man himself, Alex Jones, while he takes a well-deserved vacation.
[01:33:22.219 --> 01:33:22.459]  Alex?
[01:33:23.659 --> 01:33:25.740]  Hermes, please stop calling me the man myself.
[01:33:26.602 --> 01:33:33.609]  And it's Alex Jones, introduced by the man himself, Jason Burmas, live, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time, on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:37.753]  No, but seriously, you know, I keep making this point over and over again.
[01:33:37.773 --> 01:33:44.519]  I cannot articulate to the listeners how real this is, how fast this is moving, how hardcore this is.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:50.125]  They admit they are building a complete and total control grid
[01:33:50.836 --> 01:34:01.623]  To where you won't be able to buy or sell, to where every farm, every ranch, even tiny gardens, and people that have five or six chickens and one rooster for eggs, that's going to be controlled.
[01:34:01.743 --> 01:34:12.070]  Bureaucrats all over the country, even in areas they've traditionally not been as aggressive, like Texas, are coming on people's property and saying, basically, you are my slave, you are scum.
[01:34:12.491 --> 01:34:20.096]  I mean, I'm sitting here in a cruddy cabin in Texas, taking a few days off with the kids, and it says,
[01:34:21.044 --> 01:34:43.483]  Protect the Planet, ProjectPlanetCore.com and it says report noisy leaks, faucets and toilets, turn off TV lights when leaving room, reduce the AC heater when leaving the room, turn off water while brushing teeth, take short showers, fill sink basin to shave, participate in a linens and towels reuse program, which we don't even have here, American Hotel and Lodging Association.
[01:34:43.923 --> 01:34:49.388]  Now that's about telling you consuming is bad, that's about getting you ready to have
[01:34:49.873 --> 01:34:55.017]  What you can do, micromanaged, as Nancy Pelosi admits, this is total slavery.
[01:34:55.397 --> 01:34:57.178]  But they go, oh, but it's for your own good.
[01:34:57.198 --> 01:35:18.074]  And the colleges are filled with no-body control freaks who are being given badges and guns as the new environmental green corps, backed up by the red and black jacketed thugs of Secure Corps, training with their M-16s, not just dummy M-16s, but real ones, according to Philadelphia Daily News, to take on veterans, gun owners, and landowners.
[01:35:18.542 --> 01:35:30.891]  Every time I've been to Urban Warfare Drills, they are practicing in Canada, this is on their news in Canada as well, same with England, taking on farmers and ranchers and mowing you down with machine guns.
[01:35:31.231 --> 01:35:36.075]  So when they say, oh, support the military on Memorial Day, it isn't our military anymore.
[01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:42.579]  That's how Hitler got the Germans to stand down and do whatever they were told, is he'd say, oh, support the military, Memorial Day.
[01:35:42.599 --> 01:35:43.680]  They had one of those in Germany.
[01:35:43.991 --> 01:35:45.593]  You know, you're not against the troops, are you?
[01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:52.781]  They pin everything they do on the red, white, and blue, the esprit de corps, our history, our liberties, our freedoms, George Washington.
[01:35:53.422 --> 01:35:59.528]  This is the opposite of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Sam Adams and John Adams.
[01:35:59.929 --> 01:36:03.473]  This is high treason, and there's no doubt this is tyranny.
[01:36:03.513 --> 01:36:05.475]  There's no doubt it's used against the general public.
[01:36:05.794 --> 01:36:07.656]  It's no doubt they're harassing citizens.
[01:36:07.716 --> 01:36:11.759]  It's no doubt they're using army intelligence to spy on mainline citizens groups.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.222]  There's no doubt the government's staging terror attacks.
[01:36:15.142 --> 01:36:18.265]  There is no doubt that they are setting up, they've already set it up.
[01:36:18.645 --> 01:36:21.048]  Look, there isn't wiretapping.
[01:36:21.128 --> 01:36:27.253]  The phone companies under the 1996 Telecommunications Act are set up to intercept everything.
[01:36:28.034 --> 01:36:30.336]  By federal law, everything is red.
[01:36:30.796 --> 01:36:32.818]  By federal law, they tear open your mail.
[01:36:33.228 --> 01:36:38.630]  By federal law, they urinate, and I'm sorry to use that term, all over the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:42.311]  This is about full-spectrum dominance, is what the Pentagon calls it.
[01:36:42.551 --> 01:36:48.513]  And the Pentagon brags, Thomas Barnett and others, they're top futurists, that they openly work for offshore banks.
[01:36:48.853 --> 01:36:49.994]  They have conquered us.
[01:36:50.114 --> 01:36:58.437]  It is a big, sickening joke, but they can only continue their occupation if we're not aware that our government is illegitimate and criminal.
[01:36:58.477 --> 01:37:02.178]  Now, I'm going to get out of here so you can play the disgusting clips of the President
[01:37:03.719 --> 01:37:08.704]  Telling us about the new 2.0 Internet, which they, you read the Internet 2 documents, they brag.
[01:37:09.084 --> 01:37:11.707]  Just type in Internet 2, the Internet is dead.
[01:37:11.727 --> 01:37:18.273]  That's how they always start their conferences, with the government and corporations saying they're going to shut the web down, have Chinese-style censorship.
[01:37:18.573 --> 01:37:19.634]  Now happening in England.
[01:37:20.415 --> 01:37:25.299]  Prison planet banned in most government web systems and wireless systems in Australia and England.
[01:37:25.659 --> 01:37:27.141]  It's already happening here in the U.S.
[01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:29.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's over.
[01:37:29.671 --> 01:37:30.892]  The joking around is over.
[01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:35.074]  It's been moving incrementally, but now it's moving at warp speed.
[01:37:35.094 --> 01:37:42.979]  And I know I'm ranting because we're supposed to rant about these issues and not about our favorite football team winning or losing.
[01:37:43.019 --> 01:37:53.726]  Now that said, I want to get out of here and let you get to calls and play some of those clips, but I wanted to bring Jim Newcomer up because it was just a month ago that gold was at $880.
[01:37:55.742 --> 01:38:04.527]  880.
[01:37:55.982 --> 01:38:04.527]  And I said, ladies and gentlemen, according to Bob Chapman and others, he believes it's going to rally back up, probably by the fall, it's going to be $1,200 an ounce.
[01:38:04.667 --> 01:38:13.211]  Now, we don't have crystal balls, we're not perfect, but we are able to, you know, really gauge the New World Order's activities, and we're right about 95% of the time.
[01:38:13.772 --> 01:38:20.255]  Regardless, the dollar is openly being destroyed for the New World Order to be born, for the North American Union to be brought in right now.
[01:38:20.976 --> 01:38:22.297]  Gold and silver are the way to go.
[01:38:22.357 --> 01:38:27.618]  Now listen, they have month-old prices on silver, when silver was $3 less an ounce.
[01:38:28.279 --> 01:38:34.181]  In one coin, the Franklin, silver, half dollars, they are almost gone.
[01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:38.602]  They had to go up on Lakotas from $17 to $20.
[01:38:39.003 --> 01:38:43.064]  That's still five bucks cheaper than you'll find them anywhere else that I've seen.
[01:38:44.425 --> 01:38:45.525]  But they still have
[01:38:46.218 --> 01:38:51.184]  At the original month-old price, some of those have dollars, but they are almost gone.
[01:38:51.344 --> 01:38:56.331]  And I was just talking to Jim Newcomer, who we're about to bring up in just a minute or two, because I'm so excited about this.
[01:38:56.591 --> 01:39:02.398]  It supports the network, supports Midas, but it also supports those that are getting it and helps our entire operation.
[01:39:02.638 --> 01:39:04.721]  So it's just win-win-win-win-win for everybody.
[01:39:05.559 --> 01:39:14.048]  And it gets people to remember what real money is, not the fiat paper that they're now replacing with fiat cashless for total control.
[01:39:14.328 --> 01:39:21.115]  And the greatest crime in the New World Order is going to be black market, as they call it, underground economy operating outside their grid.
[01:39:21.415 --> 01:39:25.820]  We need to fight to hold on to cash and fight to hold on, more importantly, to gold and silver.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.101]  Now, they have gold.
[01:39:28.123 --> 01:39:29.584]  They were selling it at the $8.80 level.
[01:39:29.704 --> 01:39:31.425]  They bought it at the $9.20 level.
[01:39:31.485 --> 01:39:32.806]  It was the next big buy.
[01:39:32.886 --> 01:39:34.648]  They're almost sold out of that at $9.20.
[01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.370]  If you waited, you shouldn't have.
[01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:39.992]  They almost sold out now, the whole weekend.
[01:39:40.012 --> 01:39:41.092]  I was just talking to Jim Newcomer.
[01:39:41.653 --> 01:39:42.954]  They sold out of the $8.80 level.
[01:39:43.294 --> 01:39:44.255]  The next big buy was at $9.20.
[01:39:44.635 --> 01:39:50.079]  They're almost sold out of that in francs and in sovereigns and a few other great coins.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:56.465]  I have a lot of stuff asked about it, but tell them it's the Alex Jones Radio Special or you'll get the $9.80 price.
[01:39:56.885 --> 01:40:02.029]  That's right, it's up over $100 from a month ago, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:02.049 --> 01:40:07.594]  And even if gold was to go down next week but then rocket back up the next week, it doesn't matter because you're getting it at the $9.20 level.
[01:40:07.974 --> 01:40:09.075]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40:09.873 --> 01:40:12.996]  I'm selling this hard because this is what I believe in.
[01:40:13.036 --> 01:40:15.297]  This is the surest, safest bet.
[01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:16.338]  Is it 100% sure?
[01:40:16.698 --> 01:40:18.200]  Is it a silver bullet, pun intended?
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:27.147]  It's as close to a silver bullet as you're going to get to slay this werewolf of hyperinflation that is staring down our next right now.
[01:40:27.247 --> 01:40:29.549]  Jim Newcomer, tell folks about some of the specials.
[01:40:29.829 --> 01:40:35.213]  Alex, we have the historic gold, the $20 Liberty at $16.27, the $10 Liberty at $7.99, and those Lakota rounds that you had talked about.
[01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:40.074]  They're at $410 a roll, or $20.50.
[01:40:40.114 --> 01:40:41.475]  The Franklin halves are at $880, $176 for a roll of $20.
[01:40:41.575 --> 01:40:44.137]  We do have the Sovereign coin at $278.90, and the French, Swiss, or Belgian franc at $225.90.
[01:40:44.177 --> 01:40:45.518]  Now, let me explain, folks.
[01:40:45.538 --> 01:40:46.379]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:40:46.399 --> 01:40:49.001]  We've had, we've, Gold is up 10% here in the last month, over 10%.
[01:41:02.688 --> 01:41:04.789]  Silver's up over 20% in the last month.
[01:41:04.949 --> 01:41:09.430]  This is normally our quiet time of the year, and the phones have just been ringing off the hook.
[01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:18.934]  People are in a panic, trying to get... They understand what's going on out there in the economy, and they recognize that they have to convert the paper into real money.
[01:41:19.134 --> 01:41:21.455]  And the only way they're going to do it is to put it into precious metals.
[01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:24.156]  So I would urge you all to call us here.
[01:41:24.176 --> 01:41:24.616]  The number's 800-686-2237.
[01:41:28.395 --> 01:41:30.737]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:41:30.777 --> 01:41:36.622]  We'll have brokers here all day, up until midnight tonight, and we will endeavor to hold these prices through the weekend.
[01:41:37.202 --> 01:41:48.551]  If you can't get a hold of a broker, he'll know the date and time that you call in, and he'll get back to you as soon as he gets back to his area, whether it be Monday or not, but we will honor these prices through the weekend.
[01:41:48.571 --> 01:41:49.212]  800-686-2237.
[01:41:49.292 --> 01:41:56.137]  And ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people think this is the financial earthquake.
[01:41:56.536 --> 01:41:59.418]  This is only a tremor before the big one.
[01:41:59.439 --> 01:42:09.267]  There is no doubt we have the Bilderberg Group documents, we have the Club of Rome documents, Trilateral Commission, CFR, I watch public European Union hearings in their parliament.
[01:42:09.367 --> 01:42:14.671]  They plan on completely gutting the world economy and bringing us into a long, dark depression.
[01:42:14.912 --> 01:42:20.236]  Now, I pray we avert this, but that doesn't look like we probably are, and again,
[01:42:21.599 --> 01:42:33.249]  You think people are panicking now to buy gold and silver when the yuppies quit sucking their thumbs and acting cool and being in pompous self-delusions with their collars popped up walking around talking about what great intellectuals they are?
[01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:39.935]  When they figure out CNBC's been lying to them, they are going to race to gold and silver and you're not going to be able to get your hands on it.
[01:42:40.276 --> 01:42:44.499]  Ted is already killing himself to find gold and silver at good prices.
[01:42:44.759 --> 01:42:47.762]  Most people have been sold out off and on for the last 12 to 14 months.
[01:42:49.031 --> 01:42:52.374]  We're very competitive because we've been so aggressive in pricing.
[01:42:52.834 --> 01:42:58.159]  I'm just telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not the time to sit there idly by.
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:07.167]  You need to check out and investigate gold and silver as a hedge against all of this uncertainty that's taking place, because these are precious industrial metals.
[01:43:07.487 --> 01:43:12.452]  These things have always been what currency, real currency, real wealth is all about.
[01:43:12.512 --> 01:43:13.172]  Here is the number, 800-686.
[01:43:16.153 --> 01:43:22.636]  2-2-3-7-800-686-2237 and there will be brokers at Midas throughout the weekend, correct Jim?
[01:43:22.936 --> 01:43:23.417]  That's correct.
[01:43:23.437 --> 01:43:24.777]  We will be here Saturday and Sunday.
[01:43:25.217 --> 01:43:39.684]  Jim, this is scary because by the end of last summer we saw the unseasonal race up, and then it continued on through the fall, and now the economic news is even more in favor of gold and silver.
[01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:44.772]  It is dire, and even with the recession, with people losing their jobs and things, they don't care.
[01:43:44.832 --> 01:43:47.854]  They're getting what money they have left, they're putting it into the precious metals.
[01:43:48.834 --> 01:43:55.178]  Well, I've been telling people, and this is what a lot of other financial experts have concurred on.
[01:43:55.198 --> 01:44:00.621]  I remember six months ago, whenever Bob Chapman said, watch, it's going to race back up.
[01:44:00.641 --> 01:44:06.184]  They're going to pump the market back up to $10,000, $11,000, and then the next time they drop it, it's going to go below $6,000.
[01:44:06.844 --> 01:44:08.665]  And he'd called two years ago that it would be
[01:44:09.403 --> 01:44:15.729]  You know, $6,000 and change, you know, in the winter slash spring of 2009.
[01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:20.174]  I mean, I don't know how he does it, but he's saying this is your chance.
[01:44:20.935 --> 01:44:21.415]  Ah, whatever.
[01:44:21.595 --> 01:44:24.078]  Folks, you know, don't believe me now.
[01:44:24.138 --> 01:44:24.898]  Believe me later.
[01:44:25.579 --> 01:44:27.261]  I'm telling you, get into gold and silver.
[01:44:27.281 --> 01:44:28.662]  This is the best deal you're going to find.
[01:44:28.702 --> 01:44:30.604]  This is gold.
[01:44:30.624 --> 01:44:32.306]  $60 price in the market under
[01:44:33.187 --> 01:44:36.408]  Uh, what it is today, priced in, you can't beat that deal, 800-686-2237.
[01:44:36.468 --> 01:44:49.510]  And I really appreciate you, Jim, and Ted Anderson and everybody else, uh, giving folks this opportunity and giving me the opportunity to promote it, because I just believe in it wholeheartedly.
[01:44:49.670 --> 01:44:51.131]  We'll talk to you next week, Jim Newcomer.
[01:44:51.271 --> 01:44:51.911]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:44:52.411 --> 01:44:53.491]  All right, there goes Jim Newcomer.
[01:44:53.771 --> 01:44:57.952]  I'm going to throw it to you, Burmess, play that clip, get to some calls, and I appreciate you sitting in Sunday.
[01:44:58.372 --> 01:45:02.093]  I'll pop in as things develop with North Korea there, I hope it's just a saber-rattling.
[01:45:02.788 --> 01:45:25.418]  Alright thank you so much Alex Jones everybody and remember it is so important that you support us here if you're not getting gold and silver you know to support yourselves which you should be you know support the information war get you know Alex Jones the best of especially if you're a new listener you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber you want some of these interviews in the highest quality we are trying to do volumes of the best shows this is of January 2009

[01:45:34.325 --> 01:45:34.845]  That's new.

[01:45:37.567 --> 01:45:40.390]  And like I said, you know, this info war is very hard to support.
[01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:53.240]  It's very hard for two guys to, you know, do seven hours of radio, five hours of web TV every day, work on documentary pictures, and get the word out to the masses without your support.
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:53.921]  We're trying to expand.
[01:45:53.941 --> 01:45:56.763]  We're trying to get the office next door so we can do a weekend show.
[01:45:57.063 --> 01:45:58.624]  Alex is going to Sirius in June.
[01:45:58.804 --> 01:46:01.485]  We're having the money bomb on June 11th.
[01:46:01.545 --> 01:46:04.546]  We really do need your support and we need you to get the word out.
[01:46:04.606 --> 01:46:06.827]  So, tell people about the podcast.
[01:46:06.867 --> 01:46:09.748]  Tell people about the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:46:09.768 --> 01:46:11.188]  I have a new channel, Jason Justice 911.
[01:46:12.969 --> 01:46:14.169]  Just do everything you can.
[01:46:14.630 --> 01:46:16.970]  Fire ammunition in the info war.
[01:46:17.411 --> 01:46:24.433]  Alright, I want to play some of this clip and we're going to be periodically stopping it on and off to really describe what Obama is saying here.
[01:46:24.653 --> 01:46:25.154]  Do we got it?
[01:46:25.954 --> 01:46:26.194]  Hit it!
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.223]  As well of America's economic competitiveness.
[01:46:29.964 --> 01:46:31.626]  The small business woman in St.
[01:46:31.647 --> 01:46:31.947]  Louis.
[01:46:32.047 --> 01:46:34.651]  The bond trader in the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:46:37.617 --> 01:46:39.339]  And of course the DVD player froze up.
[01:46:39.499 --> 01:46:41.141]  At a global shipping company in Memphis.
[01:46:41.682 --> 01:46:43.424]  The young entrepreneur in Silicon Valley.
[01:46:43.784 --> 01:46:49.891]  They all need the networks to make the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery, the next great breakthrough.
[01:46:50.191 --> 01:46:51.292]  You see this involves all of us.
[01:46:51.312 --> 01:46:54.336]  The Congress alone last year accounted for some 132 billion dollars in retail sales.
[01:46:57.379 --> 01:47:02.182]  But every day, we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information.
[01:47:02.862 --> 01:47:13.208]  The disgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles away, organized crime, the industrial spy, and increasingly foreign intelligence services.
[01:47:16.022 --> 01:47:26.234]  Now, you know, notice how he demonizes the disgruntled worker, aka the whistleblower that blows the whistle on Enron, that blows the whistle on the FBI.
[01:47:26.414 --> 01:47:32.360]  We can't have whistleblowers, you know, and when he says, you know, hackers, lone hackers a thousand miles away.
[01:47:32.581 --> 01:47:33.802]  Yeah, let's demonize.
[01:47:34.062 --> 01:47:36.785]  Most hackers are people that are just trying to go with open
[01:47:37.586 --> 01:47:40.009]  OpenShare software, OpenShare information.
[01:47:40.269 --> 01:47:41.330]  It's not what you think, folks.
[01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:44.333]  If you're a little older, you're not with the lingo, you're not with the kids.
[01:47:44.633 --> 01:47:48.357]  Again, this is demonizing a broad spectrum of people and ideals.
[01:47:48.637 --> 01:47:49.718]  Go ahead, Jaren, hit the clip.
[01:47:49.798 --> 01:47:58.247]  Thieves used stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 ATMs and machines in 49 cities around the world.
[01:47:58.607 --> 01:47:59.728]  And they did it in just 30 minutes.
[01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:07.991]  A single employee of an American company was convicted of stealing intellectual property reportedly worth $400 million.
[01:48:08.091 --> 01:48:17.314]  It's been estimated that last year alone, cybercriminals stole intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to $1 trillion.
[01:48:18.474 --> 01:48:23.916]  In short, America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity.
[01:48:24.892 --> 01:48:28.194]  And this is also a matter of public safety and national security.
[01:48:28.834 --> 01:48:29.134]  See that?
[01:48:29.174 --> 01:48:32.015]  It's public safety and national security.
[01:48:32.076 --> 01:48:33.176]  Do you understand?
[01:48:34.036 --> 01:48:38.158]  We rely on them for public transportation and air traffic control.
[01:48:39.059 --> 01:48:47.163]  Yet we know that cyber intruders have probed our electrical grid, and that in other countries, cyber attacks have plunged entire cities into darkness.
[01:48:48.484 --> 01:48:49.284]  Alright, pause that right there.
[01:48:49.324 --> 01:48:51.645]  Al-Qaeda is going to release a cyber attack on this country.
[01:48:51.685 --> 01:48:52.965]  Give me a break.
[01:49:10.914 --> 01:49:13.915]  Al Qaeda doesn't exist without the U.S.
[01:49:14.075 --> 01:49:15.556]  intelligentsia system.
[01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:16.896]  We created it.
[01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:19.477]  But then he throws in other terrorist networks.
[01:49:19.797 --> 01:49:22.158]  Remember those domestic extremism lexicon?
[01:49:22.498 --> 01:49:28.360]  Make people who are anti-technology, quote-unquote alternative media, and hacktivists, terrorists.
[01:49:28.781 --> 01:49:30.721]  So again, broadening the spectrum.
[01:49:31.081 --> 01:49:31.922]  Oh, you're a hacktivist?
[01:49:31.962 --> 01:49:32.642]  You're Al Qaeda.
[01:49:32.862 --> 01:49:33.602]  We're coming to get you.
[01:49:33.622 --> 01:49:35.203]  This is a matter of national security.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.422]  We're setting up the Cyber Security Agency.
[01:49:40.122 --> 01:49:44.264]  We're going to try to pass this Cyber Security Act, this Cyber Bullying Act.
[01:49:44.484 --> 01:49:45.785]  We're taking away the Internet.
[01:49:46.025 --> 01:49:47.946]  I mean, it's a 20-minute speech, folks.
[01:49:48.367 --> 01:49:49.287]  It's a 20-minute speech.
[01:49:49.327 --> 01:49:50.127]  We can't play it all.
[01:49:50.348 --> 01:49:51.608]  We're almost in the final segment.
[01:49:51.628 --> 01:49:52.649]  Let's take a couple callers.
[01:49:52.689 --> 01:49:53.769]  We have a lot of people holding.
[01:49:54.150 --> 01:49:55.630]  Ingrid in Nevada, you're on the air.
[01:49:57.271 --> 01:49:57.752]  Yes, Ingrid.
[01:49:58.132 --> 01:49:58.352]  Yes.
[01:49:59.212 --> 01:49:59.813]  Hi, Jason.
[01:50:00.541 --> 01:50:06.464]  I would like to tell you that I grew up in Germany and my mother, she was in Hitler's Youth Brigade.
[01:50:07.364 --> 01:50:12.027]  And a lot of the things that are unfolding here is exactly what she told me.
[01:50:12.887 --> 01:50:15.068]  And she told me how much she hated it.
[01:50:15.969 --> 01:50:20.271]  And she had to spy on her parents, spy on her neighbors, spy on everybody.
[01:50:21.171 --> 01:50:29.876]  And nothing made her more happy than when the American soldiers marched into Germany and rescued her and the German people from Thailand.
[01:50:30.771 --> 01:50:47.070]  Yeah, now unfortunately and ironically, we seem to be morphing into this Nazi, Gestapo type of police state, only we're, you know, 60 plus years into the future, so this technocracy is really, it's a slicker form of propaganda.
[01:50:47.651 --> 01:50:49.332]  It's a slicker form of technology.
[01:50:49.372 --> 01:50:50.933]  It's a slicker form of control.
[01:50:51.193 --> 01:50:56.316]  And we really are being viewed in the world, and rightfully so, as the next Nazi regime.
[01:50:56.336 --> 01:50:58.417]  And it's only getting worse here domestically.
[01:50:58.557 --> 01:50:59.558]  Ingrid, I thank you for the call.
[01:50:59.798 --> 01:51:03.640]  I'm going to try to hit up John, Tim, Joseph, Roger, and Michael in the last five minutes.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:04.921]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:04.961 --> 01:51:08.202]  Back after this, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:09.363 --> 01:51:16.007]  The people need an answer right now for you to bring the hemp back to America.
[01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:20.631]  Bring the hemp back to America.
[01:51:21.451 --> 01:51:24.752]  Bring the hemp back to America.
[01:51:24.852 --> 01:51:29.373]  Don't waste our time any longer.
[01:51:29.453 --> 01:51:33.494]  The people need an answer right now for you.
[01:51:33.534 --> 01:51:37.095]  To bring the hemp back to America.
[01:51:37.975 --> 01:51:40.696]  Bring the hemp back to America.
[01:51:53.363 --> 01:51:58.066]  This is brought to you by HempUSA.org, supplier of fine hemp products.
[01:51:58.526 --> 01:52:04.489]  Sponsoring the Genesis Communications Radio Network, the leader in alternative talk radio.
[01:52:09.645 --> 01:52:14.906]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:15.681 --> 01:52:21.023]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:21.564 --> 01:52:27.746]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:28.066 --> 01:52:29.867]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:30.027 --> 01:52:32.408]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:32.488 --> 01:52:43.373]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:45.683 --> 01:52:46.904]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:47.344 --> 01:52:48.705]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:49.205 --> 01:52:55.548]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:53:04.372 --> 01:53:05.513]  The Obama Deception.
[01:53:05.933 --> 01:53:07.214]  The people strike back.
[01:53:08.875 --> 01:53:09.755]  Ah, springtime.
[01:53:10.175 --> 01:53:15.358]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[01:53:15.691 --> 01:53:20.155]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:53:20.296 --> 01:53:26.041]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[01:53:26.282 --> 01:53:34.570]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[01:53:34.890 --> 01:53:37.572]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[01:53:37.872 --> 01:53:44.057]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[01:53:44.337 --> 01:53:48.340]  So pests can't develop an immunity, and they won't harm your children or pets.
[01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:58.268]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets, and more, and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.
[01:53:58.568 --> 01:54:00.490]  Order now from FreshwaterOrganics.com

[01:54:22.695 --> 01:54:26.398]  Alright folks, I will be live 9 to midnight tonight Central Time.
[01:54:26.418 --> 01:54:29.721]  TheInfoWarrior.com is the website.
[01:54:29.741 --> 01:54:31.282]  The podcast is over on the left hand side.
[01:54:31.302 --> 01:54:39.449]  If you missed any of this show, of course we make the podcast available and we stream 24-7, 365 over at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:39.469 --> 01:54:42.152]  So tell your friends, get the podcast, spread the word.
[01:54:42.632 --> 01:54:44.273]  John in Texas, you're on the line.
[01:54:44.293 --> 01:54:44.894]  John, what's up?
[01:54:45.666 --> 01:54:53.174]  Yeah, I agree with what you and Alex Jones are saying about all the conspiracies and everything, but I just noticed you guys are real shy about talking about the Bible.
[01:54:53.194 --> 01:54:57.880]  When somebody gets on the air and tries to talk about scripture, you gently give them the brush off.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:02.284]  Well, you know, Alex talks a lot more about the Bible than I do.
[01:55:03.866 --> 01:55:08.788]  The clip we just played from SeaWorld, he talks about revelations and the Mark of the Beast system.
[01:55:08.848 --> 01:55:16.452]  And you know, I've had John, not John Connor, he used to go by John Connor, Mark Dice on my program and this program dozens of times.
[01:55:16.892 --> 01:55:22.355]  On top of that, you know, we had the America's Secret Beginnings people on, we have reverends and pastors on all the time.
[01:55:22.655 --> 01:55:27.657]  I mean, myself, I feel like this is a secular program and I'm really trying to cover the news.
[01:55:27.697 --> 01:55:33.060]  However, if I am covering secret societies or the Illuminati or if we're talking about the Vatican that day,
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:38.061]  I am more apt to take that viewpoint, but really this is a news show, sir.
[01:55:38.501 --> 01:55:42.122]  For instance, me and Alex were doing a show together.
[01:55:42.462 --> 01:55:45.503]  I'm not sure if it was mine or his, but we said a prayer on the air.
[01:55:45.783 --> 01:55:50.205]  I mean, I'm not opposed to this, and I don't oppose Christianity or any religion in general.
[01:55:50.485 --> 01:55:54.186]  It's just that I try to keep it a news program and a secular one at that.
[01:55:54.206 --> 01:55:54.686]  Go ahead, John.
[01:55:55.346 --> 01:56:03.048]  Well, we were talking about him in our Bible study in Austin, and we were wondering, we'd never heard his testimony.
[01:56:03.482 --> 01:56:06.493]  Testimony of salvation when he became a Christian or if he's a Christian.
[01:56:06.969 --> 01:56:10.191]  I know he believes in God, but I don't... Well, he's a Christian outright.
[01:56:10.232 --> 01:56:11.252]  I mean, I don't know what to tell you.
[01:56:11.272 --> 01:56:26.544]  I mean, he had Daryl Rundus on the program last week, who is a, you know, a philanthropist evangelist Christian, who's just, you know... I mean, let me tell you, when Daryl Rundus is here, he's handing out silver one-ounce pieces with the Ten Commandments on it, and we're having dinner, and it's all about Scripture.
[01:56:26.584 --> 01:56:29.046]  And, you know, I honestly... I grew up in a Christian family.
[01:56:29.486 --> 01:56:35.310]  I used to go to Methodist and Protestant churches on the reg, believe it or not, until I was about 12, 13 years old.
[01:56:36.831 --> 01:56:39.894]  And, you know, again, I just try to keep it as a secular show.
[01:56:40.194 --> 01:56:41.735]  Jones is without a doubt a Christian.
[01:56:41.775 --> 01:56:43.296]  I mean, he's an open Christian.
[01:56:43.356 --> 01:56:48.179]  If you listen to a lot of his older broadcasts, a lot of them are a little bit more evangelical.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.743]  I'd say, you know, if you really want to talk to him and his faith, save your questions for next week when he's back on the air.
[01:56:53.763 --> 01:56:54.824]  I do thank you for the call, sir.
[01:56:54.844 --> 01:56:55.345]  I got to jump.
[01:56:55.585 --> 01:56:57.266]  Let's go to Tim in Ohio.
[01:56:57.306 --> 01:56:57.966]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:56:58.487 --> 01:56:59.387]  Hey, JB, how's it going?
[01:56:59.748 --> 01:57:00.068]  All right.
[01:57:00.498 --> 01:57:02.098]  I had prepared a clip for Alex.
[01:57:02.118 --> 01:57:03.219]  I don't know if John told you not.
[01:57:03.239 --> 01:57:04.639]  Do you have 2.52 to go?
[01:57:05.039 --> 01:57:05.759]  I really don't.
[01:57:05.779 --> 01:57:13.901]  I've got less than two minutes, but if you call back in on either the Sunday program or you send it to me at MySpace.com slash Jason Burmas, maybe I can post it on the website.
[01:57:13.921 --> 01:57:15.161]  I'm not quite sure what it is.
[01:57:15.341 --> 01:57:17.342]  You got something else for me in this last 60 seconds?
[01:57:17.962 --> 01:57:18.482]  Same as Jeff.
[01:57:18.522 --> 01:57:19.502]  Well, I got to give you a piece of it.
[01:57:19.542 --> 01:57:20.722]  This is the one that Alex called for.
[01:57:20.742 --> 01:57:21.763]  It goes 19 seconds.
[01:57:22.223 --> 01:57:22.963]  Okay, go for it.
[01:57:24.759 --> 01:57:26.379]  Howard Beale may be my best friend.
[01:57:26.879 --> 01:57:27.580]  I'll go to court.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.860]  I'll put him in a hospital before I let you exploit him like a carnival freak.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.681]  You get your psychiatrist, I'll get mine.
[01:57:33.321 --> 01:57:39.042]  I'm gonna spread this whole reeking business in every newspaper, on every network, group, and affiliate in this country!
[01:57:39.342 --> 01:57:40.862]  I'm gonna make a lot of noise about this!
[01:57:41.182 --> 01:57:41.442]  Great!
[01:57:41.622 --> 01:57:43.043]  We need all the press we can get!
[01:57:43.063 --> 01:57:46.263]  That was a clip that Alex had called for last I talked to him.
[01:57:46.784 --> 01:57:48.984]  It expanded into a JB rant.
[01:57:49.517 --> 01:57:53.923]  And I'll definitely get back to you tomorrow or I'm sorry, Sunday or Monday.
[01:58:03.516 --> 01:58:07.278]  Michael Tesarian, I'm not sure I pronounced that correctly, but... No, I know who you're talking about.
[01:58:07.298 --> 01:58:10.639]  You know, I've watched The New Atlantis and some of his four-hour lectures.
[01:58:10.679 --> 01:58:13.360]  I think some of his stuff is really interesting on the symbology.
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:18.502]  But I just feel like, you know, with any of these guys, does anybody really have the whole picture?
[01:58:18.522 --> 01:58:20.223]  I really enjoy Jordan Maxwell's work.
[01:58:20.743 --> 01:58:23.625]  I think even Sitchin's work, to a certain extent, is pretty good.
[01:58:24.606 --> 01:58:37.656]  You know, I tend to stay out of that far into the symbolism, the mysticism, the history of humanity, if you will, because it's enough for me to know that the Christian conservative leaders, or supposed ones in this country, are into the occult.
[01:58:37.936 --> 01:58:41.759]  It's the Alex Jones Show, back again right after this in 30 seconds.
[01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:52.364]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:58.883 --> 01:59:07.548]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:59:07.968 --> 01:59:12.671]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:59:13.131 --> 01:59:17.773]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.
