[00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:07.096]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:10.079]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:11.241]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:14.464]  Alex should be popping in in about a half an hour or so.
[00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:23.053]  Before we go to Mike Adams of HealthRanger.org, I want to thank one of the great sponsors that make this show and others like it possible.
[00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:25.605]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:27.367]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:00:27.447 --> 00:00:29.949]  Okay, so we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.075]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable food company in the country.
[00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:40.118]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and years.
[00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.521]  You can give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.242]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:48.305]  Or just go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:50.847]  That's efoodsdirect.com.
[00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:55.070]  So now I want to go to Mike Adams of thehealthranger.org.
[00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:05.158]  Mike, before we get into, you know, this bird flu vaccination story and really the vaccinations in general, why don't you give a brief summary of how you got into this and who you are?
[00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:07.699]  Okay, great, yeah.
[00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.400]  Thanks for having me on the show today, by the way.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.061]  It's always an honor to speak to your listeners.
[00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:13.262]  I'm known as the Health Ranger.
[00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:21.226]  I'm the founder and editor of naturalnews.com, and I'm a health freedom advocate, and I used to be diseased.
[00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:35.694]  I used to be on pharmaceuticals maybe nine years ago, and I was really, really sick, borderline obese, diabetic, and so on, and using nutrition and natural medicine, and by following the principles of health freedom and personal responsibility,
[00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.511]  I was able to get really healthy and then to teach that to others and that's what I do today.
[00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:53.238]  And a lot of people don't realize that it's a lot of what you put into your body, whether you exercise or not, that's going to prevent a lot of these diseases, sicknesses, and really just make you feel a whole lot better.
[00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:58.841]  You don't need all these drugs that the pharmaceutical companies are constantly pushing on you in magazines and television.
[00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.490]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.672]  Disease is not like being struck by lightning.
[00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:08.955]  You're not struck with cancer one day out of the blue, suddenly by random chance.
[00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.477]  You know, disease is not a matter of bad luck.
[00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:13.479]  It's a matter of cause and effect.
[00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.482]  What you eat becomes the health that you exhibit.
[00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:26.729]  And we know today that we can prevent now 70, 80, maybe even 90% of all cancers just by changing what people eat
[00:02:27.502 --> 00:02:37.669]  Avoiding toxic chemicals in personal care products and in food and medicines and by getting a reasonable amount of sunlight so that you generate vitamin D in your skin.
[00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.912]  We could collapse the cancer industry overnight really just if we educate people.
[00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:52.178]  But as you well know and your listeners know that is the information that is being censored by the FDA and the FTC and that's probably a whole nother show right there.
[00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.300]  Yeah, I know.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.001]  Exactly.
[00:02:54.041 --> 00:03:01.631]  A lot of people don't understand that cancer is big, big, big business and the last thing that they want to do is to stop using radiation.
[00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:06.557]  I mean, it's like a death industry and these guys make billions and billions of dollars on it.
[00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:07.939]  They don't want you healthy.
[00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.341]  I mean, just this movement.
[00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:21.867]  That gets us really into what they're putting in the vaccinations, because they've been caught before, like I stated earlier in the hour, SV40, Simian Virus 40, in the polio vaccinations back in the late 50s, early 60s.
[00:03:21.907 --> 00:03:22.888]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:28.251]  And now we have this story coming out of, I believe it came out of Bloomberg on February 24th.
[00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:34.314]  It got picked up around the world, but really not discussed at all in any mainstream media outlets here, other than that one story.
[00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:37.495]  Bird flu and the bird flu vaccinations.
[00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:40.816]  Two separate strains and then another separate strain of flu virus.
[00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:42.297]  I mean, is this an accident?
[00:03:44.737 --> 00:03:46.018]  Well, that's the big question, really.
[00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:54.101]  And, you know, you got to remember, we almost, by we, I mean human beings, we almost caused a global pandemic.
[00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:59.303]  Well, this company really, Baxter International, based out of Deerfield, Illinois.
[00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:02.284]  They have companies in Austria and other places or, um,
[00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:07.564]  Uh, offices there where they conduct these kinds of medical activities.
[00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:12.287]  They virtually, they almost unleashed a massive global pandemic.
[00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:20.852]  It's sort of like when we almost had the Cuban Missile Crisis, you know, we were just minutes away from one guy pushing the button and having nuclear missiles.
[00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:25.935]  Well, this almost happened with the avian flu, thanks to this company.
[00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:27.376]  Is it an accident?
[00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:30.198]  Well, there are really only two possibilities here.
[00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:33.560]  One possibility is that they did it on purpose, which
[00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:37.649]  You know, they will deny, of course, but that's something that needs to be considered.
[00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:46.381]  The other possibility is that they're incompetent, and that might be even scarier, because it means it can happen at any time, accidentally.
[00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:47.283]  You see what I mean?
[00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:51.821]  Yeah, I very much think that this is not an accident.
[00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:58.327]  I mean, how do you get three separate types of flu virus, two of them being bird flu, into a bird flu vaccination?
[00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:10.178]  And then another story that came out, I believe earlier in the week that we covered here, is that now there's a new strain of flu that is 98.5% resistant to Tamiflu and other like vaccinations.
[00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:14.500]  You know, it seems to me every time they put these vaccinations out, people take them.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.281]  All of a sudden, there's a new strain and it's resistant to this for some reason.
[00:05:19.322 --> 00:05:21.463]  You know, again, I don't think it's an accident.
[00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:25.845]  Well, the vaccines are a medical joke.
[00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:28.266]  They might as well just call them placebo.
[00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:29.706]  I mean, they do not work.
[00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:38.250]  The viruses that are in the wild have already mutated to be immune to virtually all the vaccines that have ever been manufactured for avian flu.
[00:05:38.846 --> 00:05:41.006]  And you might recall a couple of years ago, the U.S.
[00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:48.608]  government spent, I don't know how many hundreds of millions of dollars, which seems small now in light of the bailout situation, but it's still a lot of money.
[00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:53.869]  They spent that on Tamiflu and other vaccines for a potential pandemic outbreak.
[00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:57.430]  All that money's wasted because those vaccines are useless.
[00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:06.932]  But here's the real worrisome part, that this company, Baxter, follows something called Biosafety Level 3 protocols, that BSL 3.
[00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.992]  Now BSL-4 is the highest level of biosafety.
[00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:15.176]  That's used to deal with really virulent strains like Ebola.
[00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:18.058]  Biosafety level 3 is just below that.
[00:06:18.498 --> 00:06:27.206]  And if you follow those protocols, it is physically impossible to contaminate these materials in the way that they were contaminated.
[00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:29.948]  So either they did it on purpose,
[00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:36.597]  Or they are not following the protocols that they claim to, which means that we shouldn't trust any of their vaccines.
[00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:40.197]  That's the big issue that people are finally starting to become aware of.
[00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:44.138]  Well, I didn't realize it was Biosafety Level 3 and there's only four levels.
[00:06:44.158 --> 00:06:45.319]  What would be like a fourth level?
[00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.939]  Like a Plum Island or something like that?
[00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.320]  Yeah, right.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.520]  Like Marburg virus or Ebola.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.742]  Extremely virulent viruses that actually can kill you within hours.
[00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:04.879]  Frankly, those viruses are not really a pandemic threat, because they kill the host too quickly to be spread.
[00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.760]  And the people from the CDC will tell you the same thing.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.543]  The real threats are from the viruses that can be carried and incubated in human beings for a long time without killing the host.
[00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:22.145]  And those are viruses that can spread easily, you know, through airports, air travel, anywhere people gather.
[00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:26.567]  And we have a lot of people living in high-density situations now around the world.
[00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:33.548]  We are, we're primed for a pandemic influenza outbreak on our world today.
[00:07:33.608 --> 00:07:36.653]  It's only a matter of time, in my opinion, before we get hit with one.
[00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:41.120]  But, you know, this company, Baxter, seems to want to accelerate the timeline, right?
[00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:46.837]  It seems like they not only want to accelerate the timeline, but they want to put it out there on such a massive level.
[00:07:46.877 --> 00:07:51.678]  I mean, can you imagine if a quarter million people in this country took that vaccination?
[00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:56.399]  One of the strains was a person-to-person strain.
[00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:08.662]  Why don't you explain how there are different strains of this bird flu, and some of it will only affect birds, but some of it can actually infect human hosts, and I think we've had something like 50 or 60 people worldwide become infected with bird flu.
[00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:10.667]  Sure.
[00:08:10.687 --> 00:08:13.809]  You know, the different strains, they're usually given nicknames.
[00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:20.852]  You might say, for example, H5N1 is the most common name for the typical avian flu strain.
[00:08:21.152 --> 00:08:23.553]  But there are different forms, such as H3N2.
[00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:32.198]  And these letters and numbers really just describe the configuration of proteins on these viruses, or viri, if you want to use the correct term.
[00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:48.715]  The bottom line is that some strains can be passed from human to human, from person to person, and these can be developed in the wild, literally by random mutation, from a strain that is not infectious from human to human.
[00:08:48.755 --> 00:09:01.165]  So, in other words, if enough people in, let's say, South China are hanging out with poultry in very unsanitary conditions, they could become infected with avian flu from the poultry, and then if
[00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.151]  I think?
[00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:26.631]  And we will get hit by this sooner or later.
[00:09:28.392 --> 00:09:29.633]  What happens if we do get hit?
[00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:32.956]  I mean, what do you think will happen if we get hit with something like this?
[00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:40.442]  Well, if you look at 1918, which was, you know, called the Spanish Flu, that was the big global infection.
[00:09:40.462 --> 00:09:45.926]  About a third of all the people in the world got sick, and about 50 million died.
[00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:47.888]  And, you know, that was
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.981]  That was almost a hundred years ago.
[00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:58.624]  You would think we have better medical technology today, but the truth is, we don't know anything more about real health today than we did a hundred years ago.
[00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:05.786]  I mean, these vaccines, these injections, these pharmaceuticals, these are not going to stop avian flu.
[00:10:06.387 --> 00:10:17.771]  So we could, once again, experience perhaps a third of the world's population being sick, and we would have far more than 50 million dead because, of course, our population is much larger.
[00:10:18.496 --> 00:10:31.365]  We're talking about a complete overrun of the hospitals, the clinics, the entire medical system would be essentially jammed up beyond belief and everyone would have to fend for themselves in such a scenario.
[00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:42.172]  Well, you know, if you're talking one-third of the population, that's 2 billion people and that just gives the government excuses for mass roundups, quarantines, I mean, will this be the end of liberty as we know it?
[00:10:42.192 --> 00:10:43.173]  I mean, worldwide!
[00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:49.048]  Oh, it very well could turn into something like that.
[00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:52.189]  I mean, quarantines are already written into law.
[00:10:52.710 --> 00:11:07.017]  You know, they've, as, as Alex has talked about many times, they've, they've done all of these simulations in cities of outbreaks and how they quarantine people and isolate them and have mandatory, uh, essentially arrests of people who show symptoms.
[00:11:07.557 --> 00:11:14.101]  I mean, yeah, this, this could be a very big deal, but the bottom line is for people out there,
[00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:24.149]  There are herbs, there are natural medicines, and I'll be happy to name some of them here, and I'll even name some sources that I don't have any involvement with, just if you want to hear some of that.
[00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:30.514]  There are things that you can do to protect yourself from this that are far more powerful than any vaccine.
[00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:33.697]  And they're safer and they're even less expensive.
[00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:35.738]  Well, let's go over that in the next segment.
[00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:45.985]  It's Mike Adams of the Health Ranger, I'm sorry, HealthRanger.org, know the... And again, this is a big industry of suffering and death.
[00:11:46.066 --> 00:11:47.627]  That's what the cancer industry is.
[00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.529]  That's what this bird flu industry looks like to me.
[00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:55.872]  I mean, when you find two separate strains in the quote-unquote vaccination, there are big problems.
[00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:57.834]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:12:01.573 --> 00:12:05.198]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:07.021]  You are not alone.
[00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:10.045]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[00:12:10.406 --> 00:12:15.152]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:17.696]  Signs include itching, pulling, tugging.
[00:12:17.756 --> 00:12:18.176]  I think so.

[00:13:01.463 --> 00:13:06.765]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:14.288]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:14.858 --> 00:13:21.043]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:21.444 --> 00:13:23.265]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:23.425 --> 00:13:25.827]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:25.907 --> 00:13:36.857]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:37.497 --> 00:13:38.798]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:40.540]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:41.016 --> 00:13:47.343]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.192]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:14:04.572 --> 00:14:10.538]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:12.087]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:14.580]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.961]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.

[00:15:58.004 --> 00:15:59.686]  OrganicaSeed.com today!
[00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.351]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:09.472]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:09.492 --> 00:16:15.456]  And before we go back to Mike Adams of HealthRanger.org, I want to thank another one of our sponsors, A Cola Blue.
[00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:20.479]  And for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I am drinking some A Cola Blue right now.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.820]  The number is 1-800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.541]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U or B-L-U-E dot com.
[00:16:32.728 --> 00:16:44.195]  The water passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then a taste and odor removal filter, and is stored in a tank illuminated by an antibacterial fungal UV light.
[00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:47.857]  It's 1-800-691-6043 or coloblue.com.
[00:16:48.317 --> 00:16:49.118]  I think it's delicious.
[00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:50.398]  I drink it all the time over here.
[00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:53.100]  You can see it at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.361]  Alright, back to Mike Adams.
[00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:58.003]  And Mike, we talked a lot about the problems in the last segment.
[00:16:58.023 --> 00:16:59.424]  Why don't you go over some of the solutions?
[00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:11.231]  Sure, a lot of really great solutions out there that you can use to protect yourself and not become a victim of the government or of modern medicine if such a scenario unfolds.
[00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:18.355]  Now, there are herbs called adaptants that are very useful for balancing and modulating the immune system.
[00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:26.860]  If you, your listeners may know, for example, that in the 1918 Spanish Flu, the people who died were those with an overactive immune system.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.142]  The virus tricks your immune system into overreacting
[00:17:30.706 --> 00:17:33.307]  And killing you with what's called cytokine storm.
[00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:34.567]  Now, I don't want to get too technical.
[00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:39.428]  I'll just say that these herbs help balance and modulate your immune system while boosting it.
[00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:43.369]  And I don't have any financial ties, by the way, with any of these that I'm going to mention.
[00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.649]  So they're just independent recommendations.
[00:17:45.969 --> 00:17:57.752]  But some of those adaptogens that really work are called rhodiola, ashwagandha, cordyceps, which is a mushroom, chaga mushroom, that's spelled C-H-A-G-A, reishi mushroom,
[00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:01.545]  And schizandra berries, which are a Chinese medicine.
[00:18:02.285 --> 00:18:11.032]  And some of the places that sell combinations of these are BaselineNutritionals.com sells a Super Virogon that's really good.
[00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:15.516]  MushroomScience.com sells a number of medicinal mushrooms.
[00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:23.783]  DragonHerbs.com and MountainRoseHerbs.com sells something called the Star Anise Herb.
[00:18:24.443 --> 00:18:26.365]  That's A-N-I-S-E, Star Anise.
[00:18:26.775 --> 00:18:32.857]  This is the herb that the Tamiflu vaccine is actually stolen from.
[00:18:33.217 --> 00:18:38.758]  Some of the active phytochemicals in that herb were then replicated by the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:18:39.178 --> 00:18:45.120]  Except the herb is better because it has a lot more synergy from the different phytonutrients.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:53.622]  So those are just some sources and some things that you can look into and you might want to have on hand for whatever happens in the future.
[00:18:54.557 --> 00:19:05.381]  So how do we combat, you know, the mainstream media and these large pharmaceutical industries that seem to have endless amounts of money to dump into advertising, both in print and on television and even on the web?
[00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:07.222]  I mean, how do we get our message across?
[00:19:09.943 --> 00:19:16.806]  Well, really, I think first it's more important just to protect yourself and protect your family members, the people close to you.
[00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:19.647]  Make sure that you can survive a pandemic.
[00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:23.489]  Make sure that you don't become a victim of the cancer industry, for example.
[00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:27.003]  In my view, no one should ever give in to chemotherapy.
[00:19:27.043 --> 00:19:30.106]  There are safer things, safer ways that you can overcome cancer.
[00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:35.433]  But in terms of getting the message out, you know, some people are willing to listen and some people aren't.
[00:19:35.894 --> 00:19:43.463]  And sadly, if there is a pandemic, those people who depend on mainstream medicine, they will die.
[00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:48.128]  They will absolutely die, because mainstream medicine will not save them.
[00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:52.169]  Just like, you know, when it comes to finances, the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
[00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:54.890]  Treasury will not save you either.
[00:19:55.511 --> 00:19:56.971]  And medicine won't save you.
[00:19:57.652 --> 00:20:08.156]  If you want to be safe, whether we're talking about finances or health, you've got to prepare yourself starting right now, because any of these things could happen at any time.
[00:20:08.196 --> 00:20:11.978]  It doesn't mean that they will happen tomorrow, but they could happen.
[00:20:13.223 --> 00:20:19.689]  These H5N1 viral strains are out there and they could become a global pandemic at any time.
[00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:26.154]  One of the things you really talk about on your website and when you do these kind of talks is personal responsibility.
[00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:26.935]  Can you speak to that?
[00:20:28.716 --> 00:20:30.978]  Yeah, I'm a big believer in personal responsibility.
[00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:34.982]  I do not agree with the handout mentality.
[00:20:35.462 --> 00:20:39.786]  I think that we should all teach ourselves, our children, and each other
[00:20:40.387 --> 00:20:46.910]  How to not just survive, but how to be proactive, constructive contributors to a better world.
[00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:54.934]  And what really concerns me in our world today is that we see too many people wanting someone else to solve their problems.
[00:20:55.414 --> 00:20:56.775]  You know, like AIG today.
[00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:05.499]  These money managers are getting billions or millions of dollars in bonuses after receiving billions of dollars in bailout money.
[00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:07.760]  It's going to have to be paid by the taxpayers.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.661]  You know, that's an outrage.
[00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:11.892]  And that's an example of what I'm against.
[00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:15.034]  Those people should be responsible for their losses.
[00:21:15.815 --> 00:21:25.841]  And we, the taxpayers, the hard-working people of this country, shouldn't be out there bailing out those rich bankers who lost all the money and have proven themselves to be incompetent.
[00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:27.022]  I'm 100% with you there, my friend.
[00:21:27.042 --> 00:21:29.603]  The website is healthranger.org.
[00:21:29.643 --> 00:21:30.604]  His name is Mike Adams.
[00:21:30.644 --> 00:21:31.764]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:21:33.406 --> 00:21:34.006]  My pleasure.
[00:21:34.688 --> 00:21:35.848]  Alright, we'll be back after this.
[00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:37.089]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:50.474]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and TheInfoWarrior.com.
[00:21:51.294 --> 00:21:52.195]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.695 --> 00:21:54.296]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.236 --> 00:21:57.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.829 --> 00:22:07.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:07.862 --> 00:22:13.204]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:22:13.744 --> 00:22:19.946]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.246 --> 00:22:22.047]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:24.587]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:24.667 --> 00:22:35.411]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:39.103]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:39.523 --> 00:22:40.904]  It's about a one world government.
[00:22:41.384 --> 00:22:47.707]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:48.287 --> 00:22:56.071]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:56.551 --> 00:22:57.692]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:58.132 --> 00:22:59.333]  The people strike back.
[00:23:01.201 --> 00:23:08.369]  We know identity scams have grown in the past six months because identity thieves are working overtime, taking advantage of this economic crisis.
[00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.752]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock.
[00:23:10.872 --> 00:23:15.978]  I talk to people every day about identity theft, and I know a lot of you are scared and nervous.
[00:23:16.278 --> 00:23:18.060]  I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:26.482]  Another identity is stolen every three seconds, but you can have the security and peace of mind that comes with being protected by LifeLock for just pennies a day.
[00:23:26.702 --> 00:23:35.904]  LifeLock is number one in identity theft protection because we work to stop identity theft before it happens, or we fix it at our expense up to one million dollars.
[00:23:36.184 --> 00:23:38.005]  Don't spend another minute worrying.
[00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:39.385]  Call LifeLock now.
[00:23:41.817 --> 00:23:42.037]  We're good.
[00:24:01.181 --> 00:24:11.290]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:24:11.771 --> 00:24:12.732]  Garden in a can!
[00:24:14.616 --> 00:24:14.916]  I think so.
[00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:46.333]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.
[00:24:46.794 --> 00:24:49.875]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.
[00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:52.777]  That's GardenInACan.com or call 866-598-7396.
[00:24:52.797 --> 00:24:52.837]  866-598-7396.
[00:25:06.812 --> 00:25:15.117]  I watch C-SPAN, I watch the Japanese Diet, I interview world leaders, and I read white papers, and more importantly, I read the books.
[00:25:15.157 --> 00:25:16.318]  These guys all write books.
[00:25:16.338 --> 00:25:24.182]  David Rockefeller, four years ago, wrote a book, and on page 400 and something, you can Google this, I forget the exact name of the book, because I'm driving through traffic.
[00:25:24.802 --> 00:25:28.024]  It was his autobiography that he wrote four years ago, like in 2006.
[00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:33.173]  And he says in there, yes, I want a world government.
[00:25:33.213 --> 00:25:36.093]  Those that accuse me of it, I say I'm guilty as charged and I'm proud of it.
[00:25:36.833 --> 00:25:49.776]  Or you have Helmut Schmidt, the former German Chancellor, before Helmut Kohl, writing a book, Men and Powers, A Political Retrospective, where he says, yes, there's a global elite, yes, we're going to rule you, yes, the banks are going to run it, and yes, I love the bohemian grove and I love the rituals we do there.
[00:25:49.796 --> 00:25:52.237]  And he says, I love the druidic rituals we do there.
[00:25:52.737 --> 00:25:56.958]  I mean, they brag in their own books that might sell 20,000 copies to each other.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.998]  Rothkopf, former head of the Kissinger Group, who wrote Superclass last year on my show.
[00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:04.129]  We call him up.
[00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:05.530]  The producer sets him up during the break.
[00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.491]  I go, hey, you know who I am?
[00:26:06.511 --> 00:26:07.991]  You got your Alex Jones, the guy.
[00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:10.073]  I want to come on the show and talk to you.
[00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:10.993]  I know who you are.
[00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:11.673]  We know who you are.
[00:26:12.354 --> 00:26:14.255]  And off air, he goes, yeah.
[00:26:14.275 --> 00:26:15.155]  And they always do stuff like this.
[00:26:15.195 --> 00:26:15.876]  And it's not true.
[00:26:15.916 --> 00:26:17.196]  But low-level people feel good.
[00:26:17.517 --> 00:26:18.077]  Oh, I'm part of it.
[00:26:18.097 --> 00:26:20.718]  He goes, you know, there's 6,000 people in the superclass.
[00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:22.559]  You're kind of the king of your movement.
[00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:23.940]  That makes you part of the superclass.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.501]  And he came on and said, yeah, it's a world government for our own good.
[00:26:26.522 --> 00:26:27.842]  And we're the superclass.
[00:26:27.902 --> 00:26:28.483]  And we run things.
[00:26:28.523 --> 00:26:29.223]  And we're nice.
[00:26:29.883 --> 00:26:30.704]  No, they're not nice.
[00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:35.886]  And that's what they tell the colonels and admirals and generals and media people.
[00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:38.587]  Oh, you know, the CFR is kind of the outer court for these people.
[00:26:38.907 --> 00:26:40.128]  There's like 5,000 members now.
[00:26:40.948 --> 00:26:44.149]  British intelligence set it up in 1922 in Pratt House in New York.
[00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.390]  And it was only a few hundred then.
[00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.551]  True roundtable group.
[00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:48.371]  Power behind the throne.
[00:26:48.411 --> 00:26:50.212]  Key people in banking, government, media.
[00:26:50.532 --> 00:26:52.913]  Now it's like almost 5,000 and it makes them all feel important.
[00:26:52.933 --> 00:26:54.134]  They're kind of in the outer court.
[00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:56.334]  We're doing global government for everyone's own good.
[00:26:56.655 --> 00:26:59.436]  We'll give you, you know, perks and better jobs and power to be part of it.
[00:26:59.456 --> 00:26:59.976]  So they have like
[00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:04.960]  5,000 of the most powerful people in America, and they have people in every other country doing it.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.840]  It's just disgusting.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.962]  It's British, behind-the-throne power.
[00:27:07.982 --> 00:27:11.605]  In the last 200 years, they had a lot of resistance to their viceroys and puppet governors.
[00:27:11.845 --> 00:27:15.968]  They learned that they removed that, but still owned everything and had a corporate-controlling elite.
[00:27:16.308 --> 00:27:22.793]  They could then bring in politicians, bring in leaders, bring in different coups, and change it up, and the people could never have a true revolution.
[00:27:23.053 --> 00:27:26.396]  It's all about shielding the real elite from true revolution.
[00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:36.399]  This is so much information that is just on your mind all the time, and I don't mean to be glib about this, but what does a guy like you do to relax or have fun?
[00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:40.300]  My survival instinct.
[00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:41.961]  This is what is fun.
[00:27:42.621 --> 00:27:47.702]  You know, warning your fellow humans is advertised as some rare altruistic thing.
[00:27:47.722 --> 00:27:49.883]  I am not even the best person, the nicest person in the world.
[00:27:49.963 --> 00:27:51.383]  I have bad thoughts, greedy thoughts.
[00:27:51.804 --> 00:27:53.444]  I like to destroy people that have gone after me.
[00:27:54.044 --> 00:27:56.685]  And I try to control that, very aggressive, you know, that avarice.
[00:27:57.606 --> 00:28:03.373]  But we're meant to grow up, have experiences, reproduce, love our children, build a better world.
[00:28:03.713 --> 00:28:07.798]  We're like a coral, or you can call us a fungus, or whatever.
[00:28:08.158 --> 00:28:10.341]  We build on top of each other, like a coral reef.
[00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:13.024]  And I know I live forever through the genetics of
[00:28:13.644 --> 00:28:14.145]  Humanity.
[00:28:14.725 --> 00:28:16.746]  I know I go on for the species.
[00:28:16.826 --> 00:28:19.148]  I kind of like those cultures that worship their ancestors.
[00:28:19.568 --> 00:28:21.050]  Because that really makes sense.
[00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.951]  I'm into humanity.
[00:28:22.991 --> 00:28:24.192]  I'm into the good things we do.
[00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:29.396]  I know that greedy, bad people that are malfunctioning tend to get in control and do really bad things.
[00:28:29.436 --> 00:28:30.997]  Because I understand my own dark side.
[00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:35.435]  I fight the New World Order to feel good.
[00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:37.376]  I fight the New World Order for recreation.
[00:28:37.456 --> 00:28:42.000]  I fight the New World Order because I know humanity has a greater destiny than we have right now.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.181]  It's not depressing to me.
[00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:44.602]  I understand what it is.
[00:28:44.642 --> 00:28:45.543]  I understand there's bad.
[00:28:45.563 --> 00:28:46.964]  I understand that's part of the process.
[00:28:46.984 --> 00:28:55.591]  It's just the elite now have such high-powered technology that if they succeed, it will irrevocably alter and damage humanity with the genetic engineering and all the things that are already happening.
[00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:58.213]  And I'm not even saying those things shouldn't happen with genetic engineering.
[00:28:58.513 --> 00:28:59.814]  The public should be truly educated.
[00:29:00.075 --> 00:29:00.975]  We should have a choice.
[00:29:01.296 --> 00:29:02.817]  If the elite was so great and grand,
[00:29:03.497 --> 00:29:06.780]  Uh, then they would actually try to empower and lift up humanity.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:21.234]  Instead, they try to mutate, dumb down humanity, uh, to make us more easy to manage and control, and then ultimately phase out, is what the elite says, to just a few hundred million servants, uh, and that's in official UN documents, 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment.
[00:29:21.254 --> 00:29:22.074]  They want to reduce our numbers by 80%.
[00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:28.738]  Uh, so, and they make it fashionable to be in population control in all of this, which the yuppies don't know is it's them.
[00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:30.039]  That's why they can't have kids.
[00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:30.899]  They took the vaccine.
[00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:36.022]  It's filled with the pathogen bound to the tetanus shot they've been caught worldwide, and it sterilizes the woman.
[00:29:36.862 --> 00:29:39.603]  Uh, you know, men's sperm count down by over 85%.
[00:29:39.663 --> 00:29:45.586]  Hundreds of different plastic combinations that they could have chosen for global standardization 60 years ago.
[00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:46.347]  They picked the one.
[00:29:46.927 --> 00:29:47.728]  We're good to go.
[00:30:02.203 --> 00:30:04.264]  And I realize by defending others, I'm defended.
[00:30:04.444 --> 00:30:25.516]  When we have an attitude of, oh, I don't care about anybody else but myself, I'm getting ahead, that actually, that other people don't care about you when you're getting screwed and hurt, that like, toxifies the social environment, and societies implode and collapse, like North Korea, or like Russia, or like Mexico, or all these other countries where people only care about themselves, or have been taught you can't fix anything, there's no hope, you can't do anything, I'll screw it, who cares, I'm only worried about me.
[00:30:26.286 --> 00:30:27.827]  But I mean, it's serious, man.
[00:30:27.867 --> 00:30:31.310]  We have eugenics being carried out against us right now.
[00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.892]  And if people don't know what eugenics are, you better find out.
[00:30:33.912 --> 00:30:35.673]  Hitler learned everything he knew from the U.S.
[00:30:35.713 --> 00:30:36.133]  and England.
[00:30:36.914 --> 00:30:45.500]  And that's why they took all over 10,000 Nazis over here to run NASA, run eugenics, run... Everything that we have today was set up by basically British and Nazi scientists and U.S.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.101]  scientists who were eugenicists.
[00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:49.563]  And that's why, after the war, they took them all over here.
[00:30:49.603 --> 00:30:51.164]  They fought over the eugenicists.
[00:30:51.784 --> 00:30:55.127]  They fought over getting them over here because they loved them and they loved what they did.
[00:30:57.378 --> 00:30:59.900]  Alright folks, we have Alex Jones in the building.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.581]  We're gonna go right over to Alex right now.
[00:31:02.962 --> 00:31:06.424]  My God, it's like, come on, stop it Burmese, it's like I'm Elvis or something.
[00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:07.464]  You are like Elvis.
[00:31:07.965 --> 00:31:09.626]  Oh yeah.
[00:31:09.646 --> 00:31:11.047]  Did you read this Politico article?
[00:31:11.347 --> 00:31:11.827]  Yeah.
[00:31:11.847 --> 00:31:12.828]  I mean, it is amazing.
[00:31:12.868 --> 00:31:15.269]  I mean, it's not snarky, it goes through four pages.
[00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:17.511]  No, no, no, listen, the guy was trying to get ahold of me for three days.
[00:31:18.511 --> 00:31:23.615]  And for some reason we didn't get the email, and then I call him finally Saturday night, he goes, I just filed it, it'll be out tonight or tomorrow.
[00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.557]  He wanted to have big quotes for me in there.
[00:31:25.957 --> 00:31:31.681]  But AOL came out with one about Bilderberg, and it's just, I mean, massive coverage everywhere.
[00:31:31.701 --> 00:31:35.024]  I mean, normally we get attacked two or three times a week in the press.
[00:31:35.344 --> 00:31:37.986]  You type Alex Jones in, it's like 30 articles, most of them hit pieces.
[00:31:38.366 --> 00:31:40.668]  So I'm definitely on the enemy's radar with this Obama deception.
[00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:46.332]  The issue is, I rarely take off, but I went out with Tommy Pallotta, the film producer and director.
[00:31:48.999 --> 00:31:58.105]  After I went and saw a premiere of one of his movies at South by Southwest Saturday night, we went to a party with Rick Linklater and Rick said, hey man, this is my best work, me and Orson Welles.
[00:31:59.986 --> 00:32:00.606]  Orson Welles?
[00:32:00.666 --> 00:32:01.427]  That's the name of the film.
[00:32:01.547 --> 00:32:02.347]  Oh, I had no idea.
[00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:04.689]  No, no, me and Orson Welles were hanging out.
[00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:06.110]  They had a seance and he was there.
[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.351]  So he said, hey, I want you to come to my film.
[00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:10.252]  It's a sneak peek that no one even knows about.
[00:32:10.752 --> 00:32:12.313]  For, you know, just his friends at the Paramount.
[00:32:12.854 --> 00:32:14.555]  And I have to say, it's Rick Linklater's best film.
[00:32:14.575 --> 00:32:15.876]  And he told me, he said, this is my best work.
[00:32:16.776 --> 00:32:18.377]  And it's just amazing film.
[00:32:18.597 --> 00:32:22.219]  It's about the, you know, early Orson Welles and like the, you know, late 30s.
[00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:26.861]  People don't understand, uh, well, uh, Orson Welles did, uh, what many consider to be... Rosebud.
[00:32:26.901 --> 00:32:28.722]  He went after, uh... Well, not Rosebud.
[00:32:28.742 --> 00:32:29.822]  It's not called... Citizen Kane.
[00:32:29.842 --> 00:32:31.463]  Yeah, but he went after, uh... Hearst.
[00:32:31.543 --> 00:32:32.043]  Hearst, yeah.
[00:32:32.063 --> 00:32:34.064]  Yeah, he basically played... William Randolph Hearst got blackballed.
[00:32:34.144 --> 00:32:36.868]  Yeah, he played Hearst, and he actually, well, he played Hearst.
[00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:37.830]  It was supposed to be Hearst.
[00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:43.017]  But he also talked about how if you control the newspapers, he can control the thoughts of the people out there.
[00:32:43.057 --> 00:32:45.301]  He said, you supply me, uh, the stories.
[00:32:45.361 --> 00:32:46.503]  The pictures, I'll supply the war.
[00:32:46.543 --> 00:32:46.823]  That's right.
[00:32:46.843 --> 00:32:47.965]  That was the Spanish-American War in 1898.
[00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:48.626]  Listen.
[00:32:50.458 --> 00:32:51.818]  I'm going to let you finish up the next 20 minutes.
[00:32:51.858 --> 00:32:59.461]  I'm going to have Tommy Pallotta in studio, but he's going to be here talking about his new film, but also just viral media itself overall.
[00:33:00.581 --> 00:33:05.123]  So, I mean, I never take offers South by Southwest, but I got invited to see this.
[00:33:05.143 --> 00:33:08.064]  I mean, it was weird being in this giant theater and there was like 60 people there.
[00:33:08.764 --> 00:33:09.564]  Only for certain folks.
[00:33:09.845 --> 00:33:10.665]  But it was a lot of fun.
[00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:13.486]  And I have to say, Rick said, look, he's never said this to me, he said, this is my best film.
[00:33:13.886 --> 00:33:15.247]  And it is his best film.
[00:33:15.707 --> 00:33:21.309]  You know, Rick Linklater of Slacker and Days of Confused and School of Rock and so many other films.
[00:33:21.329 --> 00:33:22.950]  And of course, Waking Live and Scanner Dark.
[00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.670]  I'm in both of those.
[00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:25.051]  He said, this is my best film.
[00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:29.173]  And it was just, I mean, it was just the casting, the actors.
[00:33:29.253 --> 00:33:29.793]  I'm jealous.
[00:33:29.853 --> 00:33:30.653]  I want to see it.
[00:33:30.913 --> 00:33:32.114]  Well, it's not out for four months.
[00:33:32.854 --> 00:33:33.635]  Exactly.
[00:33:34.895 --> 00:33:35.735]  It's like super secret.
[00:33:35.955 --> 00:33:36.376]  But anyways,
[00:33:37.965 --> 00:33:42.408]  They shot it all on the Isle of Man in England, but it looks like it was shot in New York.
[00:33:42.428 --> 00:33:45.389]  They did a lot of that, but just an amazing film.
[00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.250]  So that's basically it with that.
[00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.511]  I'll be back in 19 minutes.
[00:33:48.551 --> 00:33:49.552]  Burmish, you take it away.
[00:33:49.972 --> 00:33:53.874]  And by the way, the Obama Deception, as you know, number one on Google, number one on YouTube, going completely crazy.
[00:33:53.894 --> 00:33:57.976]  I also want to make an announcement to people about the film, an important announcement coming up.
[00:33:58.016 --> 00:33:59.337]  So you take it away, my friend.
[00:33:59.457 --> 00:34:00.078]  All right, you got it.
[00:34:00.418 --> 00:34:04.100]  Before we go to callers, I want to thank our last sponsor of the day, WWDOT.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.181]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:34:07.081 --> 00:34:08.842]  Folks, 1800 watts of power.
[00:34:08.862 --> 00:34:10.502]  You want to get off the grid, this is the way to do it.
[00:34:10.703 --> 00:34:13.104]  You can call them at 877-327-0365.
[00:34:13.124 --> 00:34:15.725]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:34:15.945 --> 00:34:19.406]  Or go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:23.308]  Alright, let's take your callers before Alex jumps back in in about 20 minutes.
[00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:25.629]  Let's go to Jake in Kansas.
[00:34:25.709 --> 00:34:26.529]  Jake, what's on your mind?
[00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.170]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:31.571]  Did we lose Jake?
[00:34:32.231 --> 00:34:32.431]  No.
[00:34:32.812 --> 00:34:33.392]  Okay, there we go.
[00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:34.522]  Hey, all right.
[00:34:35.583 --> 00:34:36.864]  I have four things here.
[00:34:38.445 --> 00:34:44.709]  First is, you know, I'm from Topeka, Kansas, so the first thing that comes to your mind is Governor Kathleen Sebelius.
[00:34:45.789 --> 00:34:46.850]  You pronounce it differently.
[00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.651]  I just wanted to know if...
[00:34:52.483 --> 00:34:53.663]  What the status is on that?
[00:34:53.703 --> 00:34:56.944]  Is she really now part of this federal program?
[00:34:57.264 --> 00:35:06.767]  Yeah, she was announced in the beginning of February, and then Obama said that he wanted to use her two weeks ago in his new health plan.
[00:35:06.787 --> 00:35:10.689]  I think she's the Health and Human Services Secretary, I believe.
[00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:12.329]  Yeah, she's part of the administration for sure.
[00:35:13.009 --> 00:35:14.730]  Didn't know if that went through all right.
[00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:15.270]  Okay.
[00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.811]  I'm really close to the Casey Smartport.
[00:35:19.824 --> 00:35:23.965]  You know, they have their own website there that shows the big ol' huge city picture.
[00:35:24.685 --> 00:35:26.485]  I'd like to know the NAFTA status.
[00:35:26.985 --> 00:35:30.406]  Is that still stopped, or are they split it up in a billion different groups?
[00:35:30.486 --> 00:35:46.529]  Well, I know that, at least down here, they took the private contracts away from Centracorp, which is, you know, this Mexican organization that is, I think they're in business dealings with Giuliani as well, but when they said that they ended the Trans-Texas Corridor, they just renamed it.
[00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:50.931]  Okay, and they gave it the bid to another company, so I would assume the same thing is going on.
[00:35:51.151 --> 00:36:00.835]  They can't let people know that this is part of the North American Union plan, because the North American Union still doesn't exist until, you know, Time Magazine does a similar article like they just did with the New World Order.
[00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:05.477]  So I would say that, yeah, they'll probably rename it, they'll probably give it to another contractor.
[00:36:07.818 --> 00:36:08.179]  Okay.
[00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:15.502]  When the MIAC report came out, I got really scared and I quit all my groups, the Campaign for Liberty,
[00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:24.357]  and everything until they're exposed for profiling people like that because I don't want to go to a prison.
[00:36:24.797 --> 00:36:28.758]  I vowed to myself I'd never break the law and I'll never be in prison my whole life.
[00:36:28.858 --> 00:36:30.138]  Yeah, but you're not breaking the law.
[00:36:30.158 --> 00:36:33.339]  Let me say that's a really defeatist attitude and I thank you for the call, Jake.
[00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:36.640]  I mean, for you, you should have joined more organizations.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.662]  I mean, to leave Campaign for Liberty?
[00:36:39.022 --> 00:36:41.906]  Campaign for Liberty is all about taking back the government for and by the people.
[00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:46.371]  Again, running for political office in your community to have a positive effect.
[00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:51.396]  And because they put out documents equating us with terrorists, this MIAC document,
[00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:54.238]  You shouldn't just... Listen, you're on the list already, buddy.
[00:36:54.258 --> 00:36:56.620]  It doesn't matter if you leave the organizations.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.223]  If there's a profile or a database on these organizations, you're already in it.
[00:37:01.743 --> 00:37:02.904]  You already committed to it.
[00:37:02.944 --> 00:37:04.465]  So why leave the organizations now?
[00:37:04.665 --> 00:37:08.547]  Do you think that they're going to, you know, they're going to say, Oh, you know, now that you left, you're okay.
[00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:09.528]  You don't have to go to the camp.
[00:37:09.568 --> 00:37:10.469]  That's not how it works.
[00:37:11.149 --> 00:37:13.270]  You're still, you know, probably on the red list.
[00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.551]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:14.591 --> 00:37:15.871]  I mean, I just can't believe that.
[00:37:15.951 --> 00:37:16.512]  Come on, man.
[00:37:16.892 --> 00:37:17.312]  Buck up.
[00:37:17.892 --> 00:37:27.017]  I understand that, you know, you can get a little scared when you see a document showing that if you're handing out America freedom to fascism, you might shoot cops.
[00:37:27.717 --> 00:37:31.399]  That if you have a Ron Paul bumper sticker, you're a national security threat.
[00:37:31.439 --> 00:37:34.961]  Yeah, I understand that that makes you uncomfortable, but you can't back down.
[00:37:35.301 --> 00:37:36.362]  I mean, I'm not going to back down.
[00:37:36.782 --> 00:37:38.603]  All right, let's jump to Steve in Ohio.
[00:37:38.643 --> 00:37:38.943]  Steve.
[00:37:40.131 --> 00:37:43.812]  Yeah, I'm calling.
[00:37:44.232 --> 00:37:56.837]  I've noticed, I've just been listening for about three months, and I'd like to first say it's great to find information that puts to fact what I've been suspecting for about 15, 20 years now.
[00:37:57.577 --> 00:38:07.581]  But I've noticed here in the last two weeks when I get on Yahoo Buzz, if I mention Alex, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[00:38:08.705 --> 00:38:14.110]  When I've mentioned the Missouri deal, for some reason those posts aren't coming up.
[00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.412]  And I'm not the only one that's noticing this.
[00:38:16.952 --> 00:38:24.718]  Oh, well, I gotta let you go because of the echo on your phone, but I mean, they have admitted, you know, the Digberry Brigades.
[00:38:24.778 --> 00:38:30.883]  We started getting way too big on Dig and re-editing and all that stuff, so they started having administrators bury our stories.
[00:38:31.863 --> 00:38:35.866]  Google Video has been caught numerous times censoring our videos.
[00:38:35.886 --> 00:38:43.511]  So, you know, the next step is to censor commentators who want to bring up this information, who want to link people to websites, who want to link people to a lot of this stuff.
[00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:49.355]  You know, I mean, I'm having a guy having trouble posting my InfoWarrior shows on Google.
[00:38:49.775 --> 00:38:51.956]  They just take him down and say he doesn't have the rights to them.
[00:38:52.277 --> 00:38:55.719]  Meanwhile, I give the rights to anybody to post these on the Internet so they can go viral.
[00:38:56.099 --> 00:38:57.020]  So what's the deal?
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.301]  Let's jump to Mark in Texas.
[00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:00.062]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[00:39:01.983 --> 00:39:02.744]  Hey, good afternoon.
[00:39:02.764 --> 00:39:03.384]  How are you doing?
[00:39:03.705 --> 00:39:03.945]  Good.
[00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:18.317]  Hey, I have some good information on my field of interest, which is working in the health field for about 15 years, and I've taken insulin shots for about 20, and I work with a handful of people here.
[00:39:18.797 --> 00:39:20.118]  I'm not perfect in everything.
[00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:28.165]  I've had my challenges in life, but I got poisoned by a little bit of a human growth hormone factor that had gotten in a batch of yeast.
[00:39:29.232 --> 00:39:30.833]  And I've got a sample of it.
[00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:37.277]  Most of the big drug companies, and I've talked to a few of them, they manufacture HGH and insulin, both of them.
[00:39:37.998 --> 00:39:40.559]  And it's serious weapons against people.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:52.647]  In actuality, if you want to study on the side, you can look up diabetic folks that then get HGH, which creates a reaction with them and really detriments them, almost looking like they're not decamped folks.
[00:39:53.047 --> 00:39:54.989]  You'd be surprised, if you look at the research.
[00:39:55.289 --> 00:39:58.351]  The second thing is, I'm on your side.
[00:39:59.284 --> 00:40:03.745]  Just found a scripture recently on conscience and thoughts on it.
[00:40:04.225 --> 00:40:05.426]  Maybe you could share it.
[00:40:05.446 --> 00:40:12.428]  I don't know if you have a Bible here with you, but it would kind of be interesting if you could share with me a little bit.
[00:40:13.108 --> 00:40:27.332]  I've heard you do the radio shows a couple of times recently and I'm kind of new to some of the things here, but I had a background with, listened to a fellow named Roy Masters and also been studying the Bible over the last couple of years to try to get my head straight and get my life straight.
[00:40:28.424 --> 00:40:32.607]  Kind of thankful y'all are getting the word out on a lot of this other wacky stuff that people do.
[00:40:32.907 --> 00:40:34.047]  Well, that's what we try to do here.
[00:40:34.088 --> 00:40:47.836]  You know, this is basically a secular program, but we do try to report the news stories that the mainstream media just refuses to go over, and we do try to help people get to that information and spread it out to their communities, their friends, their family, their churches.
[00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:49.797]  Any way to get it out there, I thank you for the call.
[00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:53.199]  Let's jump to Adam in New Mexico.
[00:40:53.339 --> 00:40:54.020]  Adam, what's on your mind?
[00:40:55.188 --> 00:40:56.790]  Hey Jason, how are you doing?
[00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:57.050]  Good, sir.
[00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.510]  Good to hear you.
[00:40:57.811 --> 00:40:58.231]  Thank you.
[00:40:59.132 --> 00:41:02.855]  First off, this morning I wake up to the radio every morning.
[00:41:02.875 --> 00:41:04.177]  My alarm goes off at D.J.
[00:41:04.197 --> 00:41:04.697]  this morning.
[00:41:04.717 --> 00:41:07.680]  We're talking about everything that's going on in Albuquerque.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.282]  I live in Santa Fe.
[00:41:09.822 --> 00:41:16.949]  In Albuquerque, the big corruption, the multi-millions being stolen from all these people in our city council and everything.
[00:41:16.969 --> 00:41:17.830]  And they're talking about
[00:41:18.417 --> 00:41:19.878]  What is wrong with you people?
[00:41:19.918 --> 00:41:22.180]  We are not defeated by any means by these people.
[00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:51.699]  The reason why they're trying to is because they realize that we have all the power, number one.
[00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:55.941]  And if we do anything against this, it'll fail.
[00:41:56.621 --> 00:42:02.924]  It doesn't have to become a civil war or any kind of physical violent confrontation.
[00:42:02.944 --> 00:42:04.505]  It doesn't have to go that way.
[00:42:04.905 --> 00:42:12.769]  But it was surprising how many people were calling in this morning to the radio station after I got off, and they went on with this all morning long for the rest of the show.
[00:42:13.149 --> 00:42:15.230]  And they said, you know, everybody's talking about
[00:42:15.683 --> 00:42:18.625]  Get your guns and, you know, bump it up and all this good stuff.
[00:42:18.685 --> 00:42:20.626]  And I just said, you know, it doesn't have to be like that.
[00:42:20.646 --> 00:42:22.728]  It can be prevented, number one.
[00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:27.851]  And that's something that I feel like I have to communicate across the board today.
[00:42:27.892 --> 00:42:30.754]  This is actually my first time calling in to the radio show.
[00:42:31.054 --> 00:42:32.195]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:33.676]  That will play right into their hands.
[00:42:33.756 --> 00:42:38.419]  You know, if people rise up in a physical revolution, then they get to bring in the National Card.
[00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:41.021]  Then they get to openly end Posi Commentatus.
[00:42:41.681 --> 00:42:42.683]  Right in front of everybody.
[00:42:42.963 --> 00:42:44.125]  I think it does play into their hand.
[00:42:44.165 --> 00:42:45.607]  I thank you for the call, great caller.
[00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:49.654]  We're going to come back, finish with your callers, then Alex Jones and Tommy Pallotta at the top of the hour.
[00:42:49.954 --> 00:42:53.560]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and TheInfoWarrior.com.
[00:43:01.147 --> 00:43:05.448]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.

[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.765]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:07.285 --> 00:44:14.291]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:14.858 --> 00:44:21.060]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.281]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:23.401 --> 00:44:25.841]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:25.922 --> 00:44:36.885]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:37.486 --> 00:44:38.786]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:39.146 --> 00:44:40.567]  It's about a one world government.
[00:44:41.007 --> 00:44:47.349]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:55.691]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:56.171 --> 00:44:57.331]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:57.752 --> 00:44:58.952]  The people strike back.
[00:45:01.064 --> 00:45:04.005]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:45:04.166 --> 00:45:09.388]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:45:09.688 --> 00:45:15.031]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:45:15.411 --> 00:45:16.531]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:45:16.872 --> 00:45:25.756]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:45:26.196 --> 00:45:27.818]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:45:28.018 --> 00:45:32.203]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:45:54.676 --> 00:45:56.056]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:45:56.076 --> 00:45:56.636]  Get up, stand up,
[00:46:23.593 --> 00:46:24.474]  Alright, we are live.
[00:46:24.534 --> 00:46:25.654]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:25.734 --> 00:46:27.955]  Alex will be in studio with Tommy Pallotta.
[00:46:28.015 --> 00:46:30.376]  You can see that live over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:46:30.416 --> 00:46:35.238]  We're going to try to get through the rest of the callers in this segment.
[00:46:35.479 --> 00:46:37.159]  Let's go to Charles in Missouri.
[00:46:37.199 --> 00:46:38.160]  Charles, what's on your mind?
[00:46:41.147 --> 00:46:41.507]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:42.167 --> 00:46:42.487]  Yeah.
[00:46:42.748 --> 00:46:43.908]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:44.208]  Good.
[00:46:45.168 --> 00:46:45.448]  Good.
[00:46:45.548 --> 00:46:56.652]  Hey, I just recently have heard of a, uh, a, uh, NASARA, or the National Economic Security and Reformation Act.
[00:46:56.912 --> 00:47:00.433]  I didn't know if you were familiar with that, or... I am not familiar with it.
[00:47:00.493 --> 00:47:01.313]  Why don't you enlighten us?
[00:47:02.073 --> 00:47:05.995]  Well, I just recently read about it in a Newswatch magazine.
[00:47:06.015 --> 00:47:09.716]  Uh, I called some of my friends here in town.
[00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:11.854]  You're familiar with it.
[00:47:13.515 --> 00:47:19.178]  But evidently, I mean, it's a good thing.
[00:47:19.858 --> 00:47:21.879]  I don't think it's ever going to really happen.
[00:47:22.419 --> 00:47:23.080]  Well, what is it?
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:38.687]  Well, supposedly, just to try to keep it brief, this thing sat around up on Capitol Hill for a while, getting no action, being stalled, and then late one evening in March of 2000,
[00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:47.025]  A written quorum call was hand-delivered by Delta Force and Navy SEALs to only members of the U.S.
[00:47:47.065 --> 00:47:48.206]  Senate and the U.S.
[00:47:48.246 --> 00:47:52.788]  House of Representatives who were sponsors and co-sponsors of NASARA.
[00:47:53.909 --> 00:48:00.332]  The members were immediately accompanied by the Delta Force and Navy SEALs to their respective voting chambers where they passed it.
[00:48:02.433 --> 00:48:09.857]  Upon the announcement of this thing, of the passage of it, it's supposed to restore constitutional law
[00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:14.811]  Uh, and there's quite a few other things on here.
[00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:18.774]  You know, abolishing income tax, initiates the U.S.
[00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:29.781]  Treasury Bank system with... Why don't you send that information over to Aaron at Infowars.com, Rob D. at Infowars.com, and Producer at Infowars.com, because I would be very interested to read that document.
[00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:31.442]  Uh, let's jump to the next caller.
[00:48:31.462 --> 00:48:33.583]  Let's go to Mike in Rhode Island.
[00:48:33.623 --> 00:48:34.424]  Mike, what's on your mind?
[00:48:35.344 --> 00:48:35.885]  How's it going?
[00:48:37.786 --> 00:48:38.066]  Jason.
[00:48:39.487 --> 00:48:39.627]  Hello?
[00:48:40.836 --> 00:48:41.136]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:41.176 --> 00:48:41.596]  You're on the air.
[00:48:41.616 --> 00:48:43.677]  Are you there?
[00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:44.758]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:44.798 --> 00:48:45.258]  You're on the air.
[00:48:46.258 --> 00:48:46.378]  Oh.
[00:48:47.859 --> 00:48:48.839]  Jason, I just got a call.
[00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:53.081]  I just watched the trailer for the New World Order documentary film by Andrew Meyer.
[00:48:53.641 --> 00:48:53.801]  Yes.
[00:48:53.922 --> 00:48:55.722]  I forget the other director's name.
[00:48:56.182 --> 00:48:59.544]  Do you have any idea when that's going to be released so I can get a copy?
[00:49:00.625 --> 00:49:05.967]  I don't know if they're releasing it on DVD right away or it's going to be exclusively on the IFC.
[00:49:06.027 --> 00:49:11.289]  I think it premieres sometime within the next four to six weeks, I believe.
[00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:18.332]  It was the world premiere over at South by Southwest, so I'm thinking the IFC is going to be playing it in the next four to six weeks.
[00:49:18.752 --> 00:49:22.893]  You can probably check their website or check the press releases on it.
[00:49:22.913 --> 00:49:27.055]  They're doing a lot of stories on it right now, so I would assume it's going to be soon.
[00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:30.572]  Okay Jason, so you stay in Austin permanently now?
[00:49:31.292 --> 00:49:34.734]  Oh yeah, I do a nightly show from 9 to midnight central time.
[00:49:34.914 --> 00:49:36.215]  It's called The Info Warrior.
[00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:38.056]  We got it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:38.136 --> 00:49:39.816]  So I do a five night a week show.
[00:49:39.896 --> 00:49:40.957]  I'm working on a film out here.
[00:49:41.317 --> 00:49:42.297]  You know, it's just a great gig.
[00:49:43.338 --> 00:49:43.718]  Beautiful.
[00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:48.240]  I hope to see you in New York again for September 11th.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.661]  Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:50.801]  I'll definitely see you there, man.
[00:49:51.102 --> 00:49:52.562]  I'll talk to you later, my friend.
[00:49:52.582 --> 00:49:53.523]  I'm going to jump to the next caller.
[00:49:53.543 --> 00:49:55.383]  Let's go to Alina in Canada.
[00:49:55.403 --> 00:49:56.284]  Alina, what's on your mind?
[00:49:58.567 --> 00:49:58.987]  Yes ma'am.
[00:49:59.127 --> 00:49:59.528]  Hello there.
[00:49:59.928 --> 00:50:00.128]  Yes.
[00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:02.110]  Hi Jason, how's it going?
[00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.670]  Good.
[00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:16.761]  You guys are doing an amazing job and I've been a long time listener here up in Canada and been watching your videos and I've seen the recent documentary, The Obama Obsession.
[00:50:17.041 --> 00:50:20.104]  What do you think of the Obama deception in 30 seconds ma'am?
[00:50:21.539 --> 00:50:27.360]  It's a very powerful and very well thought out, well put together documentary.
[00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:33.342]  I've downloaded it and I'm trying to make my neighbors and stuff aware of it.
[00:50:33.702 --> 00:50:34.422]  Well, that's what we need to do.
[00:50:34.442 --> 00:50:35.922]  We need to spread this information out there.
[00:50:35.942 --> 00:50:36.782]  I thank you for the call, Lena.
[00:50:36.802 --> 00:50:38.303]  We'll be back with Alex Jones and Tommy Pallotta.
[00:50:38.323 --> 00:50:40.103]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:42.804 --> 00:50:44.884]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.424 --> 00:50:48.565]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:52.443]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.563 --> 00:50:57.184]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:57.304 --> 00:51:00.065]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:00.265 --> 00:51:03.126]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:03.306 --> 00:51:08.028]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:08.268 --> 00:51:09.169]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:12.333]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:12.633 --> 00:51:19.542]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:19.642 --> 00:51:22.766]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:22.906 --> 00:51:23.166]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:25.569 --> 00:51:27.831]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:34.135]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:51:34.315 --> 00:51:41.180]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:45.483]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:51:45.663 --> 00:51:46.623]  Take action today.
[00:51:46.804 --> 00:51:48.585]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.491]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:51:55.972 --> 00:51:58.674]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.361]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:17.882]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:17.962 --> 00:52:21.465]  Alex and Tommy Parata set up at the 8 after break.
[00:52:21.545 --> 00:52:23.447]  We're gonna rush through these phone calls.
[00:52:24.067 --> 00:52:26.029]  Let's go to Chuck in California.
[00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.869]  Chuck, what's on your mind?
[00:52:28.891 --> 00:52:29.311]  Yes, Chuck.
[00:52:29.852 --> 00:52:30.112]  Hello.
[00:52:30.492 --> 00:52:30.832]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:31.673 --> 00:52:36.797]  Hi, I just wanted to share with you that you made it on AOL's news page today.
[00:52:37.758 --> 00:52:40.900]  The title of the article is under the heading, No Love for Obama Here.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.182]  New conspiracy theory emerges.
[00:52:44.082 --> 00:52:48.290]  And the link takes you to a page that says, Conspiracy Push Bilderberg Theory.
[00:52:49.072 --> 00:52:55.905]  It's about a four or five paragraph article, and in that article, PrisonPlanet.com is quoted.
[00:52:56.618 --> 00:52:58.379]  Yeah, I think we actually printed that article up.
[00:52:58.439 --> 00:53:01.000]  It's another hit piece on Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:03.082]  We read the Wired article.
[00:53:03.582 --> 00:53:06.143]  However, this one we didn't go over quite as much.
[00:53:06.163 --> 00:53:08.445]  Let me see if I can pull that out of the stack.
[00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:12.527]  But yeah, it just seems like nobody wants to own up on the information in the film.
[00:53:12.907 --> 00:53:15.389]  I mean, the information in the film is spot on.
[00:53:15.429 --> 00:53:24.334]  You show the Obama administration and what they've said outwardly, what he said to get elected, and then you show what they're actually doing, and it's the complete opposite.
[00:53:24.374 --> 00:53:24.734]  Continue.
[00:53:25.811 --> 00:53:25.991]  Yes.
[00:53:26.752 --> 00:53:27.233]  Interesting.
[00:53:28.374 --> 00:53:31.457]  They had a poll here and it says, have you ever heard of the Bilderberg Group?
[00:53:31.477 --> 00:53:32.919]  71% say no.
[00:53:33.039 --> 00:53:37.684]  And then the second question, does all this sound suspicious to you?
[00:53:37.704 --> 00:53:39.726]  69% say yes.
[00:53:40.067 --> 00:53:41.028]  And that's an AOL poll.
[00:53:41.698 --> 00:53:42.918]  Well, that's a good thing.
[00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:44.559]  We'll have to post that up there.
[00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:57.944]  But, you know, again, we read that Politico article today, and really, four pages, and it really goes over what the Bilderberg Group is, who they are, how they've been involved in administrations for the past 40 years, and it is just an incredible article.
[00:53:57.984 --> 00:54:00.685]  We're going to be doing stories about that at Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[00:54:00.925 --> 00:54:01.745]  Thank you for the call, Chuck.
[00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.586]  Let's go to Matt in Georgia.
[00:54:03.646 --> 00:54:04.406]  Matt, what's on your mind?
[00:54:04.426 --> 00:54:05.846]  Hey, Jason.
[00:54:06.186 --> 00:54:06.507]  Hey, Jason.
[00:54:06.527 --> 00:54:07.127]  How are you doing today?
[00:54:07.487 --> 00:54:07.767]  Good, man.
[00:54:08.743 --> 00:54:10.704]  I wanted to get your opinion on something.
[00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:13.846]  I've been low in testosterone since I was 22 years old.
[00:54:14.686 --> 00:54:35.898]  I'm now 31 years old and don't you think it's kind of interesting how the government was so worried, our Congress was so worried about steroids and baseball and how they made testosterone as something that's bad and it took me a year and a half to get
[00:54:36.328 --> 00:54:39.391]  My testosterone approved by my health insurance.
[00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:42.413]  By the way, have you seen Bigger Stronger Faster?
[00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:44.375]  Because I feel like that's where this is going.
[00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:46.737]  Oh no, no I haven't.
[00:54:46.917 --> 00:54:51.261]  Alright, well there's a great, my favorite movie of last year is a film called Bigger Stronger Faster.
[00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:54.804]  It is a documentary on just the subject that you're talking about right now.
[00:54:55.184 --> 00:55:03.832]  Both steroids, testosterone, and HDH and their place in society, and how they've been demonized by the mainstream, but in a lot of cases, they're quite beneficial.
[00:55:04.232 --> 00:55:05.312]  You know, I'm not a doctor.
[00:55:05.692 --> 00:55:08.853]  I'm not going to come out here and say I know exactly what's right and what's correct.
[00:55:09.093 --> 00:55:16.355]  But I'm going to tell you that Bigger, Stronger, Faster, if you haven't seen this, it was actually produced by Lionsgate and a lot of the people that put out Michael Moore's documentaries.
[00:55:16.655 --> 00:55:28.279]  It's interesting, it's funny, and it's really a top-notch film, not even just being a documentary, not even a top-notch documentary, favorite film of last year, and I'm surprised a lot more people don't know about it, Matt.
[00:55:29.979 --> 00:55:30.559]  Take a look at that.
[00:55:30.879 --> 00:55:32.920]  I mean, here's one simple stat.
[00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:41.322]  And back in like the early 1900s, men were about 750 to 1000 total testosterone.
[00:55:41.722 --> 00:55:43.584]  Now they lowered it to normal range of 250.
[00:55:44.024 --> 00:55:46.726]  I mean, we're literally one-third the men we used to be.
[00:55:46.746 --> 00:55:52.591]  It's the eugenics program that the globalists are trying to carry out to make us more docile and less productive.
[00:55:52.631 --> 00:55:53.532]  I thank you for the call, Matt.
[00:55:53.912 --> 00:55:55.874]  Let's jump to Philip in Canada.
[00:55:56.314 --> 00:55:57.255]  Philip, what do you got to say?
[00:55:58.376 --> 00:55:59.697]  Hey Jason, how are you doing today?
[00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:00.217]  Good.
[00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:08.033]  I've been following you guys for about a year and you guys are doing a really good job and keeping up.
[00:56:08.133 --> 00:56:13.757]  I try to tell everyone up here in Toronto about what you guys are doing and try to get everyone on board.
[00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:26.205]  My question to you, what exactly is the plan for the New World Order and the new Obama administration as far as continuing the war on drugs and
[00:56:26.935 --> 00:56:30.137]  And what exactly is going to happen in that aspect?
[00:56:30.238 --> 00:56:33.120]  You're going to see the same exact drug war continuing.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.181]  You're going to see an expansion of the prisons.
[00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:41.686]  You're going to see an integration of Homeland Security and other government programs into these things, and an integration of the FEMA camps.
[00:56:42.066 --> 00:56:45.429]  And you're going to see a progression of the North American Union with this administration.
[00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:48.831]  Alright, we've got Alex Jones and Tommy Pallotta coming up after this.
[00:56:48.871 --> 00:56:51.213]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:57:00.987 --> 00:57:05.728]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:57:06.068 --> 00:57:12.410]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:21.533]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:57:22.173 --> 00:57:29.595]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:35.636]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:57:35.656 --> 00:57:43.578]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[00:57:44.198 --> 00:57:51.020]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.801]  So don't delay, call today.
[00:57:57.307 --> 00:58:00.550]  And see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:06.955]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:07.475 --> 00:58:14.481]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:21.193]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:21.614 --> 00:58:23.455]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:23.575 --> 00:58:25.996]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:26.097 --> 00:58:36.884]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.940]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.721]  It's about a one world government.
[00:58:41.181 --> 00:58:47.522]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:48.082 --> 00:58:55.864]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:56.344 --> 00:58:57.505]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:57.925 --> 00:58:59.105]  The people strike back.
[00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:06.767]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:59:07.047 --> 00:59:11.829]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:17.051]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:59:17.251 --> 00:59:20.693]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:59:21.173 --> 00:59:29.361]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:59:29.702 --> 00:59:34.667]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:59:35.508 --> 00:59:41.253]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:43.816]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:59:44.076 --> 00:59:46.498]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[01:00:00.992 --> 01:00:06.056]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.397 --> 01:00:08.699]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:17.082 --> 01:00:19.428]  It is the 16th day of March 2009.
[01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:26.004]  We're now officially a day into the drop date of the Obama Deception, the obamadeception.net.
[01:00:28.735 --> 01:00:36.017]  We're going to talk about viral videos a little bit in the 52 minutes we've got here with Tommy Pallotta in studio with us in Austin, Texas here for South by Southwest.
[01:00:36.037 --> 01:00:38.977]  We're going to talk about his new film, American Prince.
[01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:48.180]  We're going to talk about Rick Linklater's film that I just got a little sneak peek of, a little secret screening, that is about Orson Welles.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:49.900]  Orson Welles and me.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.280]  Just amazing.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.841]  And Rick said it was his best film.
[01:00:52.921 --> 01:00:53.181]  I agree.
[01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:54.461]  It's his best executive of everything.
[01:00:55.061 --> 01:00:57.202]  And we'll also talk some about the Obama deception.
[01:00:57.222 --> 01:00:58.002]  I will say this.
[01:00:59.983 --> 01:01:07.486]  We have linked at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on the main page to the best free copy of the Obama Deception I've seen anywhere.
[01:01:07.506 --> 01:01:13.929]  You know, I launched it last Wednesday because we had the FBI calling here and stuff and asking weird questions and I got nervous and launched it.
[01:01:14.389 --> 01:01:15.130]  Good thing we did.
[01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:18.651]  And it became number one on Google and YouTube within 24 hours.
[01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:23.633]  And there was some chicanery there where it's still number one, but they took it off the main page.
[01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:32.401]  And then with horror I noticed that people rushed to grab it from PrisonPlanet.tv and to have it up first.
[01:01:32.801 --> 01:01:38.467]  Hundreds of people had uploaded it in low quality because that meant it was a quicker upload to YouTube and Google and other sites.
[01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:40.248]  I finally found a great one.
[01:01:40.669 --> 01:01:41.530]  Should have known all the time.
[01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.771]  I changed the channel.
[01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:47.115]  It's the channel on YouTube and he's got a director's account so we can put multi-hour films up.
[01:01:47.135 --> 01:01:47.775]  It's not in pieces.
[01:01:49.051 --> 01:01:53.314]  And it's the best YouTube encode I've ever seen, so we're linking to that for free for everybody.
[01:01:53.354 --> 01:01:54.515]  But please don't take it for granted.
[01:01:54.595 --> 01:01:55.255]  Spread the word.
[01:01:55.275 --> 01:01:57.817]  You know, there's that psychological effect of, oh, it's free, why should I care?
[01:01:57.837 --> 01:02:05.362]  This is an important film to expose that Obama is continuing Bush's policies, just with a different face on it, so they can try to move the ball down the field.
[01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:11.746]  And I do hope you will get it in the very best quality it is on the Internet, a lot better than YouTube, at PrisonPlanet.tv, or order the heart.
[01:02:12.346 --> 01:02:15.027]  The high quality DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:20.648]  But with that said, it is free on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:02:21.068 --> 01:02:26.129]  I want to thank Tommy Pallotta for taking time out of his very busy schedule at South by Southwest to come down here.
[01:02:26.169 --> 01:02:26.929]  Tommy, good to see you again.
[01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.869]  Good to see you, man.
[01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:29.969]  There is a lot to talk about.
[01:02:30.009 --> 01:02:31.930]  So what brings you to South by Southwest this year?
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:34.710]  I'm showing a little movie called American Prince.
[01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.031]  And also just a good chance to come down and be your guest.
[01:02:39.758 --> 01:02:40.719]  Well, it's great to have you here.
[01:02:40.739 --> 01:02:41.620]  You say a little film.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:51.110]  You said, oh, I'm just doing a little documentary about some guy about a year and a half ago, and then you guys invited me down to the premiere Saturday night, and it was just amazing.
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:57.817]  And then they aired kind of the part one to it, I guess from the 70s, and that was American Boy.
[01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:59.038]  So tell folks about the film.
[01:02:59.719 --> 01:03:04.963]  Well, the film is really more of a portrait of a person named Stephen Prince.
[01:03:05.484 --> 01:03:09.727]  And in 1977, Martin Scorsese filmed a documentary just about him.
[01:03:09.947 --> 01:03:13.990]  It was just a really personal documentary, and it's kind of the lost Scorsese film.
[01:03:14.831 --> 01:03:21.416]  I was living in Texas over ten years ago, and I actually ran into the guy who's the subject of that film.
[01:03:21.436 --> 01:03:23.478]  He's also the gun salesman and taxi driver.
[01:03:23.518 --> 01:03:26.060]  He's Easy Andy, the one who sells the guns to Travis Bickle.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.422]  And I instantly recognized him.
[01:03:29.102 --> 01:03:45.829]  And just over the years we sort of had a friendship and he started telling me these really great stories and I realized that there's basically a second chapter to this guy's story and so I made this video in hopes that the first film that Scorsese made would actually get a proper release.
[01:03:47.401 --> 01:03:48.761]  You know, we could YouTube it.
[01:03:49.181 --> 01:03:54.523]  We have it on DVD somewhere in the office, but we could YouTube... What would be the best term to pull up YouTube?
[01:03:54.703 --> 01:04:01.425]  His scene in Waking Life, which is a reenactment of something that really happened to him, where the big Indian comes to the door at the gas station with a knife and he shoots him with a .44.
[01:04:01.465 --> 01:04:03.045]  Hmm, I'm not sure.
[01:04:03.065 --> 01:04:05.346]  I mean, people always tag it with different things.
[01:04:05.386 --> 01:04:07.026]  Probably Stephen Prince, Waking Life?
[01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:07.686]  Yeah, try that.
[01:04:07.706 --> 01:04:08.406]  I mean, we should try it.
[01:04:08.587 --> 01:04:09.387]  Yeah, try that, folks.
[01:04:09.407 --> 01:04:09.667]  Go ahead.
[01:04:10.467 --> 01:04:19.491]  Yeah, so, I mean, initially, we had him... The Scorsese film has been sought by filmmakers for many, many years.
[01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:27.834]  And it's basically through bootleg copies, and now, you know, with BitTorrent and YouTube, it's getting sort of a second life.
[01:04:27.874 --> 01:04:34.496]  And then the thought with this was to sort of bring him back and have him show really what his influence in American cinema is.
[01:04:34.516 --> 01:04:35.777]  But you guys found a great copy.
[01:04:37.157 --> 01:04:45.580]  Oh yeah, well we found an original from him, but we actually downloaded a BitTorrent that looked even better.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.580]  Good.
[01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:52.302]  Tell us about how you're releasing this film.
[01:04:53.427 --> 01:04:58.151]  Well, you know, I mean right now it's kind of a Hail Mary moment in sort of film distribution.
[01:04:58.932 --> 01:04:59.853]  I was living in L.A.
[01:04:59.913 --> 01:05:06.418]  and I got a little bit tired of that and now I'm currently living in Amsterdam trying to look for new ways to sort of make films and distribute them.
[01:05:07.019 --> 01:05:16.227]  And one thing I've always been really aware of are the films that you've been making and other like-minded individuals and how you've been utilizing the internet to sort of gain an audience.
[01:05:16.267 --> 01:05:20.571]  And that's becoming more and more interesting to me than the sort of traditional distribution methods.
[01:05:20.691 --> 01:05:21.832]  And you've been saying that for a decade.
[01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:23.553]  It's not like you're just coming up with what I did.
[01:05:23.573 --> 01:05:24.713]  I mean, you've always been into that, too.
[01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:28.776]  Yeah, well, I mean, technology and storytelling have always been my twin interests.
[01:05:29.456 --> 01:05:32.878]  And finding new ways to just basically express yourself.
[01:05:32.898 --> 01:05:37.321]  You know, freedom of expression is really the main tenet of life, I believe.
[01:05:37.881 --> 01:05:39.122]  And trying to make
[01:05:39.682 --> 01:05:46.569]  You know, I really like making studio films, but at the same time I want to be able to make smaller films that can still reach an audience.
[01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:49.031]  And now it seems like it's the perfect time to do that.
[01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:54.316]  I mean, never before in my lifetime has it been so easy to disseminate information in entertainment.
[01:05:55.797 --> 01:05:59.901]  And Rick Linklater's in your film doing some of the interview with Mr. Prince as well.
[01:06:01.843 --> 01:06:03.303]  I mean, I was not familiar with his work.
[01:06:03.343 --> 01:06:05.064]  I knew the character from some of the films he was in.
[01:06:05.384 --> 01:06:07.145]  But just amazing life this guy's had.
[01:06:07.205 --> 01:06:08.845]  And it's been just as amazing since then.
[01:06:09.145 --> 01:06:10.426]  Yeah.
[01:06:10.526 --> 01:06:13.327]  Yeah, so Richard Linklater is a good friend of mine.
[01:06:13.367 --> 01:06:16.588]  Of course, I produced Scanner Darkly and Waking Life, which you both were in.
[01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:25.330]  And I needed somebody who had fresh ears because I'd sort of rehearsed with Stephen for many times.
[01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:30.312]  I needed somebody who really knew a lot about film and that he respected.
[01:06:30.692 --> 01:06:38.818]  So Rick was visiting LA one night and we just sort of really grabbed a crew together in a couple of hours and just shot this movie literally in five hours.
[01:06:40.279 --> 01:06:42.221]  Well it looks great and you kind of
[01:06:43.365 --> 01:06:46.347]  Yeah, you know, it takes place in one room.
[01:06:46.768 --> 01:06:50.751]  It's one person talking and it's one night and that's a really hard thing to sort of pull off an entertaining
[01:07:01.259 --> 01:07:02.460]  We're good to go.
[01:07:20.754 --> 01:07:24.076]  Well, I mean, there were a lot of critics there and a lot of directors, and they got an outstanding ovation.
[01:07:24.096 --> 01:07:24.677]  They really liked it.
[01:07:24.857 --> 01:07:28.520]  Yeah, it was pretty nice to do the Q&A afterwards.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.422]  Stephen is actually there, and he'll be there Tuesday.
[01:07:31.442 --> 01:07:37.126]  Tuesday morning we're doing our second screening at 11 o'clock at the Alamo Lamar.
[01:07:37.526 --> 01:07:38.467]  Yeah, Alamo South Lamar.
[01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:39.227]  Yeah, South Lamar.
[01:07:40.868 --> 01:07:46.733]  And he just really handled himself really well, and there's a lot of filmmakers really... He's just a cult figure.
[01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.535]  And he lives between Austin and L.A.
[01:07:49.575 --> 01:07:50.676]  too, so he's in Austin.
[01:07:50.856 --> 01:07:58.803]  Yeah, he's lived here for many years and he spends most of his time in L.A., but he's here now, so we're very lucky to have him.
[01:07:59.524 --> 01:08:00.525]  Oh, he's quite a character.
[01:08:00.765 --> 01:08:01.245]  Yeah, he is.
[01:08:01.971 --> 01:08:03.391]  Did we find anything on YouTube with him?
[01:08:04.332 --> 01:08:05.632]  We'll see if we can find that later.
[01:08:06.852 --> 01:08:08.692]  There's even some of American Boy on YouTube.
[01:08:08.953 --> 01:08:09.153]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.573 --> 01:08:15.074]  You might try shooting or shoot a gun scene in Waking Life.
[01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:16.794]  I bet that would bring it up, guys.
[01:08:16.834 --> 01:08:18.955]  If not, there's a couple of DVDs back there in the back.
[01:08:22.315 --> 01:08:24.316]  So when are you planning to release this?
[01:08:26.087 --> 01:08:29.215]  Well, you know, I mean, we opened it up at the festival.
[01:08:29.235 --> 01:08:31.181]  It's a good way to sort of give it some legitimacy.
[01:08:31.682 --> 01:08:34.269]  And the next thing I really want to do is release a BitTorrent.
[01:08:35.353 --> 01:08:38.475]  And just sort of see if it can have its life on its own.
[01:08:38.495 --> 01:08:40.517]  I mean, I'm a big fan of BitTorrent.
[01:08:41.097 --> 01:08:57.710]  I'm an avid user of that technology and, you know, really watching kind of how you've been able to really gain an audience using these different platforms like BitTorrent and YouTube and Google Video and, you know, all these other things.
[01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:58.770]  It's just, it's really
[01:08:59.651 --> 01:09:01.251]  Impacted me in a very profound way.
[01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:05.452]  And I feel like that's something that I really want to be a part of.
[01:09:05.872 --> 01:09:07.833]  Well, I'm glad I'm a part of it in a small way, Tommy.
[01:09:08.713 --> 01:09:09.333]  What's the date?
[01:09:09.413 --> 01:09:11.914]  Are you planning a date to release it on BitTorrent next few weeks, next month?
[01:09:11.934 --> 01:09:15.075]  I think probably in about a week or so.
[01:09:15.255 --> 01:09:16.135]  You know, as soon as I can.
[01:09:16.155 --> 01:09:17.495]  I basically just have to get it together.
[01:09:17.555 --> 01:09:22.556]  I want to put together a nice little written explanation of why we're doing this.
[01:09:23.357 --> 01:09:27.918]  So in the next two to three weeks, look for American Prince on a computer screen near you.
[01:09:27.938 --> 01:09:28.998]  Yeah, on BitTorrent.
[01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.359]  Yeah, we love that BitTorrent.
[01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:32.100]  So does Burma's.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.361]  Burma's can get you anything you want off the BitTorrent, including movies, six months before they're out.
[01:09:36.521 --> 01:09:37.521]  Well, you know, it's really great.
[01:09:37.581 --> 01:09:44.584]  I might have talked about this last time I was here, but I went to Korea, and we were showing Scanner Darkly there.
[01:09:45.244 --> 01:09:46.865]  And in Korea, everybody downloads.
[01:09:47.245 --> 01:09:52.647]  And I asked the audience how many people had seen Scanner Darkly already, and everybody raised their hands.
[01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:56.668]  Everybody had already downloaded and watched it, yet everybody paid to come see the movie.
[01:09:57.268 --> 01:09:59.031]  And to see it the way that it was meant to be seen.
[01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:01.294]  And that was a real epiphany for me.
[01:10:01.755 --> 01:10:05.521]  And I mean, obviously, every time you go to the Alamo and do a screening, it sells out.
[01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:07.564]  You know, you're able to sell DVDs.
[01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:11.029]  I mean, it doesn't exclude people from seeing, you know, and...
[01:10:13.072 --> 01:10:15.793]  It is empowered the grassroots, but also even big filmmakers.
[01:10:16.153 --> 01:10:26.537]  And I never intended to make it a successful vehicle to be able to finance my whole operation, but that's what it turned into, just because I would make little shorts and documentaries and things, and I wanted to warn people.
[01:10:26.797 --> 01:10:29.718]  I wanted to get my message out, and so people really embraced that.
[01:10:29.778 --> 01:10:39.161]  Going back now, I've been putting viral videos out for 12 years, and we also kind of pioneered going up and confronting politicians, kind of aggressive press questions, and now that's proliferated all over the world.
[01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:45.588]  And so without knowing that we were part of people pioneering that, we have done that.
[01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:56.721]  The problem is now Obama, this is in Wired Magazine Friday, is trying to sign a secret treaty to ban BitTorrent and peer-to-peer type stuff.
[01:10:57.182 --> 01:11:00.943]  Well, I mean, they can try, but I kind of feel like you've opened up Pandora's box.
[01:11:01.363 --> 01:11:02.824]  Well, I think we've all done it, so, you know.
[01:11:02.844 --> 01:11:11.867]  Yeah, I mean, you look at what's going on with Pirate Bay right now, and there's a big trial with that, and at the worst-case scenario, they close down that side, another one's just going to pop up.
[01:11:12.367 --> 01:11:17.308]  So, the great thing about the Internet is that it is pretty hard to shut down.
[01:11:17.328 --> 01:11:20.669]  Well, there's also this new phenomenon of people wanting to put their films out this way.
[01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:21.310]  Exactly.
[01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:22.450]  So that's totally legal.
[01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:23.951]  There's different types of commodity.
[01:11:23.991 --> 01:11:28.093]  I mean, the film that I'm doing has a very limited audience, very niche.
[01:11:28.133 --> 01:11:32.056]  It's really for people who love film and love film history and things like that.
[01:11:32.336 --> 01:11:36.238]  So it's not like it has real big mainstream crossover appeal.
[01:11:36.619 --> 01:11:40.681]  So for me, gaining the audience is the most important thing for me.
[01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:44.904]  Getting the people to actually see the film is really the best reward.
[01:11:45.104 --> 01:11:51.348]  And not only is there that reward, but then it has the best chance of actually becoming financially successful, I think, is the chance we've got.
[01:11:52.287 --> 01:11:52.688]  We've got a break.
[01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:55.011]  We'll be right back with Tommy Pallott on the other side of this break.
[01:11:55.031 --> 01:11:58.616]  The new film premiering on the internet in a few weeks is American Prince.
[01:11:58.656 --> 01:11:59.137]  Stay with us.
[01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:04.610]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:09.972]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:12:10.152 --> 01:12:14.934]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:12:15.314 --> 01:12:26.418]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:12:26.818 --> 01:12:32.382]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:12:32.602 --> 01:12:38.687]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[01:13:01.407 --> 01:13:06.669]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:07.461 --> 01:13:12.805]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:19.529]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:19.809 --> 01:13:21.650]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.192]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:13:24.272 --> 01:13:35.159]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:38.716]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:39.116 --> 01:13:40.497]  It's about a one world government.
[01:13:40.977 --> 01:13:47.300]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:55.644]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:56.144 --> 01:13:57.285]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:58.906]  The people strike back.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:05.664]  Hello, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[01:14:05.984 --> 01:14:17.896]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[01:14:18.336 --> 01:14:23.361]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[01:14:23.921 --> 01:14:25.363]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:31.895]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:36.351]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:37.612]  Give me a call.
[01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:42.035]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:14:43.156 --> 01:14:45.777]  And allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[01:14:46.438 --> 01:14:48.059]  That's Peter Kronschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:14:48.099 --> 01:14:52.462]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.662]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:15:04.102 --> 01:15:07.405]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:15:07.885 --> 01:15:13.829]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:18.332]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:15:18.832 --> 01:15:24.556]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:15:24.856 --> 01:15:27.838]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:30.960]  I think so.
[01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.292]  Well, Tommy, this was a bold move.
[01:16:26.522 --> 01:16:30.186]  I mean, you don't talk your film down, but you didn't build it up.
[01:16:30.626 --> 01:16:38.834]  I mean, this is a film that's got Scorsese in it, it's got Rick Linklater, it's got you, it's got Stephen Prince in it, and the amazing stories.
[01:16:38.854 --> 01:16:44.039]  I mean, this really was the road manager for a bunch of big rock bands and people, and it's just incredible stories.
[01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:46.141]  What people don't know is that...
[01:16:48.202 --> 01:17:00.406]  A lot of the stuff in the American Boy he did in the 70s with Scorsese, which is a documentary with him talking, that's cut into your film, is what ended up in the first cult classic, Pulp Fiction.
[01:17:00.426 --> 01:17:00.986]  Tell those stories.
[01:17:03.247 --> 01:17:09.529]  You know, the scene where they put the adrenaline needle in the girl who ODs, you know, probably one of the most memorable scenes of the movie.
[01:17:10.373 --> 01:17:13.456]  He's almost taken verbatim from the documentary.
[01:17:13.876 --> 01:17:16.198]  One of the most memorable scenes in cinema.
[01:17:16.418 --> 01:17:18.961]  Yeah, and that happened to Stephen Prince.
[01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:25.467]  He's the guy who put the adrenaline shot into the girl's heart and saved her life, basically.
[01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:26.668]  I don't know.
[01:17:41.909 --> 01:17:46.130]  Well, you know why he's so successful in film and working with Scorsese and others is he is a really interesting person.
[01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.650]  I mean, you meet these people who are so original,
[01:18:05.285 --> 01:18:06.226]  Flat out dynamic.
[01:18:06.706 --> 01:18:08.167]  And Mr. Prince certainly is that.
[01:18:08.807 --> 01:18:14.710]  You want to just briefly tell the story for people that haven't seen Waking Life with him shooting a guy in the chest?
[01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:21.634]  Yeah, well, it's actually a true story about somebody who was trying to rob him when he was working at a gas station.
[01:18:22.094 --> 01:18:28.895]  So he's gone off heroin, he's no longer doing the road managing, and so he tries to, you know, get out of there, go to upstate New York, he's at a big gas station.
[01:18:29.095 --> 01:18:35.117]  Yeah, and it turns out that it was an escaped convict, you know, that was gonna rob him.
[01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:39.498]  I'm wrong, he moved out to the desert back in California, go ahead.
[01:18:40.098 --> 01:18:45.979]  And, you know, he had to shoot the man, and he got back up and he shot him several more times.
[01:18:46.636 --> 01:18:52.499]  And then he tells a story how like the cops basically were, you know, had to question him because they were just like, you killed him on the first shot.
[01:18:52.539 --> 01:18:53.239]  Why did you shoot him?
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:19:00.923]  You know, he emptied his chambers and, you know, and, uh, and so he, but he has, it's really the way that he relates the story.
[01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:01.984]  It's the way that he tells the story.
[01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:02.964]  That's, that's really amazing.
[01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:04.145]  His eyes are electric.
[01:19:04.285 --> 01:19:04.505]  Yeah.
[01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:04.845]  Yeah.
[01:19:05.625 --> 01:19:06.066]  Big eyes.
[01:19:06.846 --> 01:19:10.947]  But I think like American Boy, you know, hadn't been seen and you had to get these bootlegs.
[01:19:10.987 --> 01:19:17.188]  I mean, when I first got it, it was a VHS tape of several generations, really scratchy, and that's the way like most people seen it.
[01:19:17.508 --> 01:19:18.328]  Now it's up on YouTube.
[01:19:18.568 --> 01:19:22.569]  You know, you can just go type in American Boy, Stephen Prince, and you can start watching that, so.
[01:19:23.009 --> 01:19:33.951]  In fact, pull up American Prince, Stephen Prince, or pull up American Boy, Stephen Prince, and just roll some of it in the background without audio while we're here on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:33.971 --> 01:19:34.751]  Yeah, yeah, do that.
[01:19:38.025 --> 01:19:47.257]  Shifting gears, Rick Linklater, you know, we went out to the Driscoll after your premiere Saturday, hung out for a few hours and Rick's never been like this to me.
[01:19:47.277 --> 01:19:52.623]  I mean, we talk about politics, we talk about technology, we talk about all sorts of stuff and we hang out.
[01:19:54.345 --> 01:19:55.845]  But he came over here with a hand.
[01:19:55.885 --> 01:19:57.406]  He said, listen, I want you to come see this.
[01:19:57.886 --> 01:19:59.106]  This is my best film.
[01:19:59.766 --> 01:20:00.706]  This is my best work.
[01:20:00.766 --> 01:20:02.147]  And he was, like, really excited.
[01:20:02.647 --> 01:20:04.327]  And I thought, wow, Rick's never acted like this before.
[01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:07.448]  So I went and saw it today, and it blew me away.
[01:20:07.468 --> 01:20:08.768]  It's not because I know Rick or whatever.
[01:20:08.788 --> 01:20:10.408]  I mean, I was really watching it objectively.
[01:20:10.828 --> 01:20:12.349]  I think this is, overall, his best work.
[01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.949]  Yeah.
[01:20:13.269 --> 01:20:18.070]  And, you know, I can't wait to see how the rest of the public's going to react to it.
[01:20:18.872 --> 01:20:25.054]  Um, you know, we just saw it, so I'm still processing it and everything, but it's really great to see that, and I'm a huge fan of Rick.
[01:20:25.794 --> 01:20:38.718]  Rick's, um, you know, I mean, Rick has just been a constant influence in my life, not only as a friend, but, um, I think that he's probably one of the most interesting, you know, film directors alive and, you know, working today, and so it's always an event for me to go see his movies.
[01:20:40.118 --> 01:20:46.200]  Well, it was just great to be included in it, and a secret sneak, I mean, that was literally, this was not advertised, only
[01:20:47.077 --> 01:20:49.778]  I guess that's because it's so long until it comes out, four or five months.
[01:20:49.858 --> 01:20:51.519]  October, did it say, when it's going to come out?
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:58.783]  And it stars Zac Efron, which I thought was an unusual choice, the guy from High School Musical 3, which I actually saw on the airplane coming down here.
[01:20:59.343 --> 01:21:02.965]  Well, the guy that plays Orson Welles looks just like the young Orson Welles.
[01:21:02.985 --> 01:21:04.105]  And he acts like him too, right?
[01:21:04.165 --> 01:21:07.207]  I mean, he sort of has that gravity and that magnetism.
[01:21:07.387 --> 01:21:09.810]  But he's not the only amazing actor or actress.
[01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:13.313]  I mean, all of them do a fabulous job like they're not acting.
[01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:17.297]  Because, you know, I mean, even great films, there's one or two people who really don't carry it off.
[01:21:17.838 --> 01:21:22.943]  Rarely, at least in my opinion, do I see a film where they all, you are transported, you know, to 1937.
[01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:23.463]  Right, yeah.
[01:21:23.483 --> 01:21:27.147]  No, it was a fantastic experience.
[01:21:28.028 --> 01:21:30.170]  And it's also somewhat tragic, but then it's okay.
[01:21:31.448 --> 01:21:44.039]  Yeah, I mean, it's, uh, it's, again, it's always, I think the interesting thing about Rick's films is they kind of go along these strange lines, you know, these margins, and it's always, the people are always traveling along those margins.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:48.924]  We'll be right back with Tommy Pallotta, award-winning filmmaker, producer, director.
[01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:51.987]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.487 --> 01:21:54.088]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.029 --> 01:21:57.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.161 --> 01:22:03.803]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:07.365]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:22:07.725 --> 01:22:11.127]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:22:11.507 --> 01:22:17.691]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:22:18.071 --> 01:22:23.135]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:22:23.295 --> 01:22:29.999]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:31.200]  Need something more?
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:35.062]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[01:22:35.362 --> 01:22:43.408]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:48.011]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:51.873]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:56.155]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:21.385]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:21.785 --> 01:23:23.627]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:23.767 --> 01:23:26.169]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:26.269 --> 01:23:37.198]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:37.838 --> 01:23:39.139]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.881]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:41.357 --> 01:23:47.701]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:23:56.526 --> 01:23:57.687]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:58.107 --> 01:23:59.288]  The people strike back.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.743]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:24:04.923 --> 01:24:08.987]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:17.135]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:24:17.415 --> 01:24:17.835]  We're good to go!
[01:24:50.667 --> 01:25:00.651]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:09.855]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:25:10.456 --> 01:25:13.417]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:21.778 --> 01:25:28.840]  Well, I got about 25, 26 minutes left with Tommy Pallotta here in studio with us in Austin, Texas during South by Southwest.
[01:25:29.693 --> 01:25:32.075]  Tommy, what is coming next for you?
[01:25:32.155 --> 01:25:37.840]  I know you are, I mean, folks, Tommy has just made a lot of successful movies, directed and produced them, been in them.
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:44.386]  He also, first thing you did was like quite a few very successful MTV videos back in the day.
[01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.868]  You've done major commercials.
[01:25:46.968 --> 01:25:51.311]  You've consulted for one of the largest corporations in the world, but you don't like to get into that.
[01:25:51.732 --> 01:25:55.235]  You have, right now, you're designing museums.
[01:25:56.436 --> 01:25:59.799]  Well, I mean, as far as it being a safer place, I don't know about that.
[01:26:20.416 --> 01:26:25.498]  I do know that probably the best place to be as things get worse are around people that you care about and love.
[01:26:26.459 --> 01:26:29.020]  And so that's where I am right now.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:37.463]  And I do want to say that one of the greatest pleasures I have living there is that I listen to your show daily through my iPhone.
[01:26:38.203 --> 01:26:39.223]  And it's amazing.
[01:26:39.243 --> 01:26:45.966]  And I know last time we were here, we talked about doing an iPhone app specifically for the InfoWars, the InfoWarrior app.
[01:26:46.066 --> 01:26:48.707]  And I was wondering whatever happened with that, or has anything happened?
[01:26:49.007 --> 01:26:53.209]  When you mention that, we probably had no exaggeration, more than 50 people.
[01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:54.369]  50 groups.
[01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:55.930]  I don't know how to wade through it.
[01:26:57.550 --> 01:27:00.191]  But the problem is, nobody just said, here's an app, you can have it.
[01:27:02.072 --> 01:27:05.273]  The issue is we have about 130,000 people a day downloading the free podcast.
[01:27:06.194 --> 01:27:10.255]  And I have a responsibility to take somebody's app, but they still control it.
[01:27:10.535 --> 01:27:12.736]  They can just flip the switch one day and put something else on it.
[01:27:13.136 --> 01:27:14.877]  And I've had that with things I've built up.
[01:27:15.317 --> 01:27:24.101]  As soon as people figure out that they can't, not that I'm some big shot, but that they can't get through to me at my office, they will go attempt to take it over with whoever I'm in business with.
[01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:25.641]  That's why there's very few people I can trust.
[01:27:25.681 --> 01:27:29.383]  I can trust you, Tommy, because I've known you for more than a decade, and a few other people, but I've been
[01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:41.081]  And I've said I've still got to be bold and outgoing and work with other people, but as you get bit, it makes you trust fewer and fewer people and it makes you value your friends who haven't ever screwed you.
[01:27:41.101 --> 01:27:43.682]  I've only received being your friend.
[01:27:43.702 --> 01:27:49.044]  I know you've had good experiences with me as well, but I mean, how do you deal with that with Hollywood where it's even worse?
[01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:50.624]  I mean, how do you deal with all the subterfuge?
[01:27:50.644 --> 01:27:55.686]  You know, I think you follow your instincts and you kind of follow your heart, but I mean,
[01:27:57.785 --> 01:28:06.350]  To the listeners out there, I'm sure there's somebody out there who really wants to help you out and whose intentions are really good and who would sort of give over ownership and control to you.
[01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:08.151]  I think it's a really important tool to have.
[01:28:08.811 --> 01:28:10.852]  We need an app, so you just click it and it launches it.
[01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:12.633]  Right now we're on Flycast and all that.
[01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:14.154]  Yeah, and that's what I use.
[01:28:14.194 --> 01:28:20.557]  I use Flycast, but I mean it would be great to sort of get a feed of the news stories as you put them up and get more links and more additional information.
[01:28:20.577 --> 01:28:25.200]  I wish that there was like a very specific, you know, InfoWars application.
[01:28:26.605 --> 01:28:27.506]  Well, there you go.
[01:28:28.407 --> 01:28:31.971]  I'll just have to launch it, I guess, or go with somebody.
[01:28:32.151 --> 01:28:35.795]  I know that there's somebody out there listening who can do this and who can make it happen.
[01:28:36.155 --> 01:28:42.822]  And if there's anybody who's listening who's wanted this application themselves and has the ability, if I could program, I would do it for you.
[01:28:43.122 --> 01:28:44.544]  I promise I would be the one doing it.
[01:28:44.744 --> 01:28:46.266]  Well, with us it's all been an issue of funds.
[01:28:46.286 --> 01:28:49.329]  I've now got two main, you know, full-time IT guys.
[01:28:49.349 --> 01:28:52.331]  We've got a consulting company and we are looking at the apps.
[01:28:52.732 --> 01:28:55.535]  I've just been kind of the last three months only doing Obama Deception.
[01:28:56.015 --> 01:28:56.235]  Yeah.
[01:28:56.335 --> 01:28:59.739]  And so I haven't been able to make decisions on that, but I'm glad you keep bringing that up because it is important.
[01:28:59.879 --> 01:29:02.001]  So let's, I mean, how is Obama Deception doing?
[01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:03.783]  I mean, what's been the reaction so far?
[01:29:03.803 --> 01:29:06.125]  I mean, I watched it on YouTube myself, so.
[01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:07.586]  Well, give me your real review of it.
[01:29:07.606 --> 01:29:09.147]  You know, it's my own little film book style.
[01:29:09.447 --> 01:29:10.007]  I think it's great.
[01:29:10.027 --> 01:29:23.677]  You know, I mean, the really amazing thing that I've noticed, because I watch all your films, is that it almost seems like it's a constant thread that runs through your movies, and each time you're kind of refining your ideas and your thoughts.
[01:29:23.737 --> 01:29:25.458]  And the films are chapters, like in a book.
[01:29:25.798 --> 01:29:28.880]  And it's really always great to be on that journey with you.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.644]  I feel like as you're investigating and you're learning, that we're along that ride with you, and I think that that's a really amazing thing.
[01:29:34.864 --> 01:29:35.965]  Well, I appreciate that, Tommy.
[01:29:36.045 --> 01:29:43.232]  I hate to hear talking about myself, but you've been watching that progression and I hope it's getting better.
[01:29:43.392 --> 01:29:57.465]  We can make even better films if I wasn't focused on other energies and other places and other issues we're having to deal with, but I would call you a real progressive, a classical liberal, not the mainline fake corporate liberal.
[01:29:58.366 --> 01:29:59.467]  You, very early on,
[01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:13.734]  Before Obama was even elected, you weren't obviously from McCain, but I remember you saying, I got a bad feeling the way the media is covering him, what they're doing with him, I think he's going to betray people, and that had some input on me deciding to make the Obama deception.
[01:30:14.395 --> 01:30:24.079]  I mean, why did you, and now it's being proven, you know, correct me, he's in the news today saying, yeah, no rights for detainees, it's all continuing, more troops, you know, hiring nothing but lobbyists.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.601]  I mean, why early on did you not trust Obama?
[01:30:28.703 --> 01:30:37.065]  Well, a lot of it's instincts, but I think, you know, I mean, of course I was a Ron Paul supporter, you know, from the very get-go.
[01:30:37.605 --> 01:30:43.446]  And, you know, I have an amazing amount of respect for him as a person and as a politician, which I think is very rare.
[01:30:44.406 --> 01:30:49.808]  But I was in Europe during the elections, and people there were very pro-Obama.
[01:30:49.828 --> 01:30:54.189]  I think, like, in Holland, 90% of the people were pro-Obama, wanted him elected.
[01:30:56.784 --> 01:31:02.229]  And one thing that I told them is like, America is a very young country and you can never really count it out.
[01:31:02.329 --> 01:31:05.892]  And one thing that America is really good at is reinventing itself.
[01:31:06.833 --> 01:31:11.157]  And I knew that Obama was pretty much the only choice they had for that reinvention.
[01:31:12.057 --> 01:31:17.042]  Which is actually why I really like the cover of your new movie with the mask on top of it.
[01:31:17.062 --> 01:31:21.346]  I mean, it really is kind of putting on a new face to the same old ideas.
[01:31:22.146 --> 01:31:24.067]  Um, and he was the perfect person to do that.
[01:31:24.107 --> 01:31:27.108]  And it almost seemed, you know, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.
[01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:31.749]  I mean, I was thinking about that with the, uh, the Madoff people and all the people working around him.
[01:31:31.769 --> 01:31:34.270]  You know, it's like, okay, all this money keeps on coming in.
[01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:38.292]  It doesn't seem like it should happen, but now everybody's saying like, oh, we didn't know what was going on.
[01:31:38.752 --> 01:31:41.153]  You know, I mean, at some point you have to trust your instincts.
[01:31:41.193 --> 01:31:45.214]  And if something, you know, it's too good to be true, then, you know, you should question it.
[01:31:45.234 --> 01:31:47.295]  I think there's an obligation to question those things around you.
[01:31:47.975 --> 01:31:49.877]  Well that's the problem with this confidence game.
[01:31:49.937 --> 01:32:02.450]  Now all these good people, and that's in the film, who believe they were repudiating Bush, like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, he's a big conservative, but he said you must vote for Obama, you must repudiate the crimes of Bush in the world's eye.
[01:32:03.231 --> 01:32:08.114]  But now that they're invested in Obama, they're getting hurt because they're having to admit that he's a fraud.
[01:32:08.454 --> 01:32:13.436]  But a lot of other Obama supporters, the Obama people, they can't admit they've been conned.
[01:32:13.456 --> 01:32:17.719]  And so suddenly they're like, well, we've got to have troops over there and we've got to not give the detainees any rights.
[01:32:17.779 --> 01:32:21.301]  And, you know, so what if he has lobbyists and so what if there's all this corruption?
[01:32:21.581 --> 01:32:23.162]  So they've kind of bought into it now.
[01:32:24.002 --> 01:32:31.668]  Like we saw with Mussolini or Hitler or other people and that's the problem is Bush was a demonic little creature who couldn't sell used cars.
[01:32:32.108 --> 01:32:39.614]  Obama is slick and good-looking and smart and he can sell this agenda, this reinvention and I think we're in deep, deep, you know, very deep trouble.
[01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:40.254]  Yeah.
[01:32:40.675 --> 01:32:51.484]  Well, I mean, also another, this is going to sound silly, but the designer who made the Hope posters for Obama that were pretty ubiquitous and everywhere is the same guy who did Andre the Giant posters.
[01:32:52.104 --> 01:32:53.766]  And remember the image of Andre the Giant?
[01:32:53.786 --> 01:32:53.866]  Obey!
[01:32:53.886 --> 01:32:55.187]  Yeah, and it was Obey.
[01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:59.350]  And I was looking at it going like, wow, you know, Hope and his image kind of looks a lot like
[01:33:00.316 --> 01:33:02.478]  Andrew, Andre the Giant and Obey.
[01:33:02.498 --> 01:33:06.821]  And I was looking at even the words, Hope and Obey, have very similar shapes to them.
[01:33:06.861 --> 01:33:10.864]  I mean, the letters are kind of moved around, but you can almost make Hope out of Obey.
[01:33:11.445 --> 01:33:17.129]  And of course, that poster art is from, you know, the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:24.334]  So, I mean, it's kind of, it's, I mean, that there was kind of a tip off to me, too.
[01:33:24.835 --> 01:33:25.055]  Sort of.
[01:33:25.075 --> 01:33:25.956]  But it's not even a real...
[01:33:26.912 --> 01:33:29.473]  Time Magazine and others have the cover, we're all socialists now.
[01:33:29.753 --> 01:33:36.895]  This isn't socialism giving 9.7 trillion in five months to the banks with no strings attached and a few hundred billion to the people.
[01:33:37.355 --> 01:33:38.956]  That's not socialism, that's piracy.
[01:33:39.296 --> 01:33:40.016]  Yeah, they're looting.
[01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:41.337]  It's looting.
[01:33:42.176 --> 01:33:43.177]  That's what's happening right now.
[01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:46.180]  And that's what's happening all around.
[01:33:46.741 --> 01:33:49.063]  And people, they're so confused.
[01:33:49.524 --> 01:33:54.489]  I mean, even an educated person who's really following this stuff, it's hard to tell where this money trail is going.
[01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:57.392]  We're being told so many different things.
[01:33:58.153 --> 01:33:59.174]  It's just boggling, I think.
[01:34:00.262 --> 01:34:06.147]  Shifting gears back into Rick Linklater and his new film uh... Orson Welles and me uh... or me and Orson Welles.
[01:34:06.568 --> 01:34:07.508]  You're getting it backwards.
[01:34:07.529 --> 01:34:12.613]  Do you think that's... I mean I hope this film is successful because it is his best work.
[01:34:12.993 --> 01:34:26.826]  Yeah well uh... you know it's it's always it's always a difficult thing and you know Rick's always been he's he's a filmmaker who works on the margins as well and uh... he's never he's had success but he's never been completely in the system he lives in Austin Texas
[01:34:27.406 --> 01:34:31.110]  You know, he makes the kinds of films that he wants to make, and you hope that that gets rewarded.
[01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:34.013]  Well, no, I mean, this film is really good.
[01:34:34.854 --> 01:34:37.076]  It's a chick flick, but it's also a guy's flick.
[01:34:37.096 --> 01:34:39.559]  It's the perfect mix, and it's historical.
[01:34:39.919 --> 01:34:42.922]  The Mercury Theater and its opening day with Caesar.
[01:34:42.942 --> 01:34:44.804]  I don't know.
[01:34:44.824 --> 01:34:46.325]  I've seen so many films that try to
[01:34:47.327 --> 01:34:50.691]  Repackage and give you a window into theater.
[01:34:51.191 --> 01:34:51.352]  Right.
[01:34:51.412 --> 01:34:54.355]  And into Shakespearean theater, and a lot of them don't do it very well.
[01:34:55.096 --> 01:34:56.577]  I think Mel Gibson with Hamlet did.
[01:34:56.958 --> 01:34:58.459]  This, I think, tops that.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:05.107]  I mean, just the stylized nature, the way it's billed as fascist, and I think it fits in with the whole fascism we have today.
[01:35:05.267 --> 01:35:05.647]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:05.848 --> 01:35:13.977]  And I mean, I think that it sort of transcends this whole notion of theater, too, because it's really about the creative process and what it takes to make something with a group of people.
[01:35:13.998 --> 01:35:17.522]  And it's about the creative process in general, which is what I really enjoyed about it.
[01:35:18.939 --> 01:35:24.104]  Yeah, I don't want to give any spoilers, but folks, you need to see the film when it comes out in October.
[01:35:24.944 --> 01:35:27.747]  This is Rick Linklater's crowning achievement.
[01:35:27.767 --> 01:35:31.090]  We've got some of it up on screen from YouTube as well.
[01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:33.432]  I mean, this actor, he looks like Orson Welles.
[01:35:33.692 --> 01:35:36.715]  Yeah, he talks like him, you know, same delivery.
[01:35:36.855 --> 01:35:37.635]  This guy's great too.
[01:35:37.916 --> 01:35:38.096]  Yeah.
[01:35:39.244 --> 01:35:41.087]  Oh man, just amazing.
[01:35:41.507 --> 01:35:46.955]  You know, we've got about 15 minutes left in airtime, Tommy, and there's so much going on, so much happening.
[01:35:48.157 --> 01:35:52.523]  You were talking during the break about technology being a double-edged sword, and we never brought that up.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:54.640]  Yeah.
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:56.480]  Well, you know, I mean, that's the same thing.
[01:35:56.521 --> 01:36:07.523]  As much as I love listening to your show on my iPhone, it gives me that window, you know, while I'm biking around Amsterdam, you know, I also realize that it has a very sophisticated tracking system to it.
[01:36:07.843 --> 01:36:10.484]  You know, it records everything you do, every single call.
[01:36:10.524 --> 01:36:12.344]  I mean, and I worry about that.
[01:36:12.384 --> 01:36:15.225]  You know, it's kind of like, are you trading convenience
[01:36:15.885 --> 01:36:19.668]  Well, we're being inserted into the Matrix while we fight the Matrix with the Matrix.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.221]  I think more and more people seem to be waking up.
[01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:38.942]  Just watching my mom react to you the other night was a pretty amazing experience for me.
[01:36:38.962 --> 01:36:40.022]  And what a big fan she's become of you.
[01:37:02.776 --> 01:37:04.477]  Well, that's thanks to you turning her on to the show.
[01:37:04.537 --> 01:37:06.317]  But that's the way it happens.
[01:37:06.377 --> 01:37:13.200]  I mean, we share with our friends and a lot of times, you know, I remember when I first, we were actually friends before I started listening to your show.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.381]  And I think for a lot of people, they're sort of resisting at first.
[01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:24.144]  When you're saying something that's so far outside of the mainstream and the party line, there's a natural tendency to resist.
[01:37:24.998 --> 01:37:50.686]  um... those things and and i think after time and just sort of the repetition and you start listening to things like first like i like well you know what that kind of makes sense or you know how many times can you be you know folder art are uh... you feel that like something else is going on that i'm not getting from the mainstream media well i talk about real things and it's from my perspective so there could be some distortion there but i'm attempting to tell the truth and when i talk about people then see in their own lives
[01:37:52.006 --> 01:37:55.868]  And, you know, the other thing I always tell people is that, like, nobody's right 100% of the time.
[01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:56.628]  You know?
[01:37:57.408 --> 01:38:01.610]  Worst case scenario, if you're only right 10%, that is a scary thing.
[01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:03.871]  You know, that's 10% too much.
[01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:11.554]  So, I think it's, and I also think it's very patriotic to question those things around you and to, you know, look at what's happening around you.
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:15.331]  How do you think it's going to end for Obama?
[01:38:15.511 --> 01:38:23.535]  I mean, I think they're going to pile all the corruption, all the corporate agenda on him, and hang him out to dry just like Bush, and then they'll bring the new puppet in.
[01:38:23.995 --> 01:38:26.336]  But he was kind of like their last shot.
[01:38:26.376 --> 01:38:28.917]  I agree with you that this is the only way they could reinvent themselves.
[01:38:29.338 --> 01:38:33.159]  This trick isn't going to work again, and Congress's approval rating is still down at 9%.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.961]  He's got a high one, but nobody else does.
[01:38:36.101 --> 01:38:37.902]  I don't see too many more tricks in the bags.
[01:38:38.262 --> 01:38:42.004]  Staged terror attacks, wars, new politician phenomenons.
[01:38:42.964 --> 01:38:45.748]  I don't, I mean, I see the establishment coming to a crisis point.
[01:38:46.328 --> 01:38:49.773]  Yeah, I mean, maybe this is the dissolution of our nation.
[01:38:49.973 --> 01:38:50.734]  You know, who knows?
[01:38:50.794 --> 01:38:57.362]  I mean, it doesn't seem like that by the end of all this, if it keeps on following the current trend, who knows where it could end.
[01:38:57.542 --> 01:38:58.984]  You know, it could just completely collapse.
[01:38:59.985 --> 01:39:02.046]  And that's also the double edge of globalism.
[01:39:02.226 --> 01:39:08.528]  You know, I mean, there's other countries, you know, like China saying, like, we got to help these people out because they can't collapse because we have too much invested.
[01:39:08.688 --> 01:39:11.769]  You know, so it's really hard to tell where that that is going to end.
[01:39:11.909 --> 01:39:18.352]  Well, that was the globalist plan, is that as the dollar started falling, the world bought back into it because they were so invested in it.
[01:39:18.372 --> 01:39:19.692]  They had no other choice.
[01:39:19.752 --> 01:39:22.133]  But you can only hold people hostage so long.
[01:39:22.533 --> 01:39:24.454]  It sort of sounds like a con game, too, doesn't it?
[01:39:24.754 --> 01:39:26.075]  Oh, it is a globalist brag.
[01:39:26.115 --> 01:39:27.175]  It's their big master plan.
[01:39:27.575 --> 01:39:27.815]  Yeah.
[01:39:27.955 --> 01:39:38.122]  They get all these countries dependent on each other, and then the globalists are above it, and they're outside the very laws they foisted on the nations, and so it's a world government of hypocrisy.
[01:39:38.542 --> 01:39:38.742]  Yeah.
[01:39:38.822 --> 01:39:53.332]  I mean, the very bankers that engineered the crisis are now using it to get even more power and control, and even if the general public isn't informed, at the very basic level they know, wait a minute, a world government of, for, and by the bankers when they're the ones that did all this?
[01:39:54.164 --> 01:39:55.785]  And it kind of seems like an old story, right?
[01:39:56.006 --> 01:39:57.607]  I mean, the bankers are the bad guys.
[01:39:57.647 --> 01:39:59.228]  I mean, we've seen it in the Bible.
[01:39:59.248 --> 01:40:01.090]  You know, we've heard it throughout history.
[01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:03.552]  We've been warned many times by our own presidents.
[01:40:05.113 --> 01:40:08.456]  And it's because bankers create money out of nothing.
[01:40:09.097 --> 01:40:10.158]  And then they get the world.
[01:40:10.178 --> 01:40:11.039]  People will kill for $100.
[01:40:11.599 --> 01:40:12.760]  They'll kill for a fancy car.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.001]  They'll kill for a big house.
[01:40:14.221 --> 01:40:15.602]  And here's this class of bankers
[01:40:16.479 --> 01:40:21.703]  Who issue it all and own it all and run it all just because they're able to do the magic trick and fool the public.
[01:40:21.924 --> 01:40:22.764]  It's a spell!
[01:40:23.185 --> 01:40:25.507]  Yeah, and they enchant the public.
[01:40:25.567 --> 01:40:26.708]  It's literally an enchantment.
[01:40:27.008 --> 01:40:28.209]  And it's a bit of a shell game.
[01:40:28.249 --> 01:40:33.793]  I mean, it's always interesting when you think about how you read articles like 45% of the nation's wealth is destroyed.
[01:40:34.474 --> 01:40:35.714]  How is the wealth destroyed?
[01:40:35.754 --> 01:40:36.494]  How is it created?
[01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:39.535]  You know, I mean, was it ever really there anyway?
[01:40:39.695 --> 01:40:41.435]  Or was it just an illusion the entire time?
[01:40:41.455 --> 01:40:41.876]  Well, that's it.
[01:40:42.116 --> 01:40:50.557]  They've made the whole world about their fiat currency and their fiat system, and they tell us in three months we've lost almost half of our wealth and it's dropping every week.
[01:40:51.097 --> 01:40:58.259]  But if you look at it, they're actually destroying the fiat wealth so that nobody can pay them off, so then they get the real wealth.
[01:40:59.039 --> 01:41:07.048]  That destruction of wealth, just like the Great Depression was engineered, and that's now on record, congressional testimony, was about blowing everything out so they can consolidate it.
[01:41:07.088 --> 01:41:10.852]  I know I'm like a parrot that just says that over and over again, but the public better figure that out.
[01:41:11.093 --> 01:41:15.237]  Because until we arrest these bastards, they're not going to back off.
[01:41:15.358 --> 01:41:16.819]  I mean, it's either them or us.
[01:41:17.694 --> 01:41:32.072]  Yeah, but also when you say that you're like a parrot and you keep on repeating these things, mainstream media repeats the same talking points over and over and over and over again, and that's what makes it so effective, you know, that you really are literally entranced by the television set, you know, by their talking points that go on.
[01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:35.596]  And anytime anything major happens, you see that again and again and again.
[01:41:35.796 --> 01:41:40.618]  You know, that's the biggest wake-up point for people that I talk to, just in the general public, is they watch the nightly news.
[01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:45.700]  It's the same news, almost the same script, with the same ads throughout the broadcast.
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.601]  And people just instinctively, at a base level, go, something stays with that.
[01:41:49.997 --> 01:41:50.577]  Yeah.
[01:41:50.617 --> 01:42:03.902]  Well, we were talking about the sort of wake-up call being Waco, which I completely agree with you, and I was working at the library at the time, and every single day there was like a new story, and everybody forgot what it said the day before, even though it completely contradicted itself.
[01:42:04.482 --> 01:42:06.022]  And I thought that was scary, you know?
[01:42:06.062 --> 01:42:07.783]  And that was, how many years ago?
[01:42:07.803 --> 01:42:08.823]  20 years ago?
[01:42:08.843 --> 01:42:09.483]  When was Waco?
[01:42:09.584 --> 01:42:10.724]  Yeah, it was like 18 years ago.
[01:42:11.344 --> 01:42:25.789]  and I mean and there's there's so much more access so much more access to alternative media now and it really is an obligation to find these different perspectives and you know to some extent you have to you have to sort of that's really what I've done people ask how do you know it's real how do you know it's not when you get a
[01:42:26.909 --> 01:42:31.935]  It's like a jigsaw puzzle when you've got the documents, the bills, the white papers, what the globalists say they're planning.
[01:42:31.955 --> 01:42:36.340]  They're very honest in their white papers to their enforcers and minions, the people that carry it out.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:42.327]  And then you get more and more pieces to it and you're always just getting a clearer and clearer picture of what they're actually doing.
[01:42:42.387 --> 01:42:43.989]  Final segment with Tommy Pallotta.
[01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:45.811]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:42:45.831 --> 01:42:46.711]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:42:46.731 --> 01:42:48.532]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:42:48.572 --> 01:42:53.375]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:43:12.193 --> 01:43:15.034]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:43:15.374 --> 01:43:31.278]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:33.819]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:43:33.839 --> 01:43:35.139]  I use one every day.
[01:43:35.559 --> 01:43:38.020]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.422]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:07.615 --> 01:44:12.959]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:13.499 --> 01:44:19.684]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:19.984 --> 01:44:21.805]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:21.965 --> 01:44:24.367]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:24.427 --> 01:44:35.335]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:37.606 --> 01:44:38.867]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:39.267 --> 01:44:40.688]  It's about a one world government.
[01:44:41.128 --> 01:44:47.472]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:48.053 --> 01:44:55.838]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:56.318 --> 01:44:57.459]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:57.879 --> 01:44:59.080]  The people strike back.
[01:45:01.127 --> 01:45:02.008]  Detoxify.
[01:45:02.068 --> 01:45:06.552]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:45:06.672 --> 01:45:12.438]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:45:12.658 --> 01:45:16.362]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[01:45:16.562 --> 01:45:21.546]  With the help of Nutri-A-Dine, Keeler Max will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[01:45:21.687 --> 01:45:27.312]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[01:45:27.392 --> 01:45:31.335]  Add Malignablock to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:45:31.415 --> 01:45:35.739]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membrane.
[01:45:35.759 --> 01:45:36.219]  I think so.
[01:46:03.151 --> 01:46:05.612]  Everybody knows the dice are loaded, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:05.672 --> 01:46:16.634]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed, but we can do something about that.
[01:46:17.594 --> 01:46:27.376]  And I've been forgetting in this last 50-something minutes, with my good friend Tommy Pallotta in studio with us, there's a website, AmericanPrinceMovie.com.
[01:46:27.436 --> 01:46:29.737]  AmericanPrinceMovie.com.
[01:46:31.498 --> 01:46:32.301]  Be sure and check it out.
[01:46:32.321 --> 01:46:33.927]  A lot of information about the film.
[01:46:33.967 --> 01:46:34.569]  Believe me.
[01:46:35.292 --> 01:46:35.814]  Believe me.
[01:46:37.185 --> 01:46:41.408]  You want to check out the website, you want to check out the film, and it comes out in a few weeks for free.
[01:46:42.249 --> 01:46:44.851]  And don't forget, the Obama Deception is free as well.
[01:46:44.911 --> 01:46:46.873]  We have a high-quality YouTube copy of it.
[01:46:47.633 --> 01:46:48.934]  They encoded it well, they put it up well.
[01:46:48.974 --> 01:46:50.816]  Something like the quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:46:50.836 --> 01:46:52.237]  We suggest you go there and support us.
[01:46:52.857 --> 01:46:55.419]  Or the super high-quality DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:55.439 --> 01:46:59.442]  But regardless, AmericanPrinceMovie.com.
[01:46:59.482 --> 01:46:59.743]  Tommy?
[01:46:59.763 --> 01:47:02.525]  Yeah, well, I just want to say it's so great to be here again with you.
[01:47:03.446 --> 01:47:04.667]  My second visit to the studio.
[01:47:05.387 --> 01:47:08.848]  How long, I think you were like our second guest, Tex Martins was our first here.
[01:47:08.868 --> 01:47:10.989]  How often are you going to be coming back to the States?
[01:47:11.029 --> 01:47:11.970]  How often to Austin?
[01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:14.270]  Because we used to go on bike rides every week when you lived here.
[01:47:14.931 --> 01:47:15.351]  I don't know.
[01:47:16.151 --> 01:47:20.633]  I'll tell you, the winters in the Netherlands suck.
[01:47:21.413 --> 01:47:24.655]  And I really miss Texas during the winter time.
[01:47:24.695 --> 01:47:27.576]  So I'm going to have to start spending more time here during the winter months.
[01:47:29.602 --> 01:47:31.643]  Within two weeks, American Prince will be up?
[01:47:31.983 --> 01:47:32.884]  Yeah, within two weeks.
[01:47:32.964 --> 01:47:35.725]  And you're going to link the BitTorrent at AmericanPrinceMovie.com?
[01:47:35.765 --> 01:47:40.408]  Just go to AmericanPrinceMovie.com every, you know, maybe next week and there'll be information about that.
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:42.409]  I'm excited.
[01:47:42.509 --> 01:47:44.991]  In the time we've got left, we were talking in the break, I...
[01:47:46.516 --> 01:47:57.841]  Five, six years ago, I didn't know if we could turn this around, but I really do think, Tommy, that if everybody out there who loves liberty and freedom, we don't even all agree, but just get involved and be the change we want to see in the world, like Gandhi said.
[01:47:57.861 --> 01:47:58.882]  I think we can make a better world.
[01:47:59.442 --> 01:48:09.987]  Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, they push people past the breaking point, and I think that, you know, you always wonder where that tipping point is, and I think we're definitely right at that point.
[01:48:10.787 --> 01:48:12.188]  Things don't seem to be getting better.
[01:48:12.368 --> 01:48:13.389]  They seem to be getting worse.
[01:48:13.969 --> 01:48:18.112]  And, you know, sometimes in dark times, that's when you see the light and people are going to react.
[01:48:18.752 --> 01:48:21.714]  And, you know, the human spirit is an incredible spirit.
[01:48:22.075 --> 01:48:24.276]  And I think that people are waking up all the time.
[01:48:24.936 --> 01:48:26.117]  And I don't think that this is the end.
[01:48:26.257 --> 01:48:29.039]  You know, I think that this is a minor detour.
[01:48:29.799 --> 01:48:31.941]  And eventually we're going to come back and we're going to prevail.
[01:48:33.351 --> 01:48:33.931]  I agree with you.
[01:48:33.971 --> 01:48:37.073]  It's like my rant and many of the other rants in Waking Life.
[01:48:38.454 --> 01:48:39.535]  That's evergreen.
[01:48:39.815 --> 01:48:42.697]  You told me years ago that in films you make, you want them to be evergreen.
[01:48:42.717 --> 01:48:45.338]  You don't even really care about them being a big success at the time they come out.
[01:48:45.678 --> 01:48:46.599]  You want to touch people.
[01:48:46.639 --> 01:48:48.400]  You want to communicate.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.481]  That's what I'm trying to do here.
[01:48:51.162 --> 01:48:55.164]  It's not that I just want to matter or exist in the future with the information I put out.
[01:48:55.264 --> 01:48:59.246]  I want to commune with humans in the future, but I also want to commune with people today.
[01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:05.597]  You'll see good people who love freedom to come together and to be active.
[01:49:06.141 --> 01:49:15.407]  Yeah, and you know, I mean, I'm at a point in my life where I'm in my 40s now, and I'm, you know, I'm kind of seeing things from a different perspective, and I really have an immense amount of hope.
[01:49:15.467 --> 01:49:21.872]  I mean, now I relate to young people and older people alike, and everybody seems to be on the same page right now.
[01:49:22.032 --> 01:49:28.216]  Everybody, you know, is worried or hopeful or whatever, but everybody knows that something has to change and that we're going down the wrong path.
[01:49:28.236 --> 01:49:28.856]  They're changing.
[01:49:28.896 --> 01:49:29.637]  They're waking up.
[01:49:29.677 --> 01:49:30.477]  They're tuning in.
[01:49:30.757 --> 01:49:31.578]  They're questioning.
[01:49:31.598 --> 01:49:35.100]  They're not just like rats going through a maze, accepting the system they've been given.
[01:49:35.461 --> 01:49:35.901]  Exactly.
[01:49:36.521 --> 01:49:42.167]  And I think that this is, I've never, I've never, I haven't been alive where I've seen that go just across the board.
[01:49:42.487 --> 01:49:47.131]  No matter what age, or gender, or race, or whatever, everybody seems to be waking up right now.
[01:49:48.272 --> 01:49:48.673]  I agree.
[01:49:48.713 --> 01:49:57.201]  I mean, I don't even know a lot of mainline yuppies that are waking up, so it's not even agreeing with us folks, it's looking down from the ground, up and around you, and seeing the bigger picture.
[01:49:57.641 --> 01:49:58.042]  Exactly.
[01:49:59.344 --> 01:50:01.505]  It is AmericanPrinceMovie.com.
[01:50:01.545 --> 01:50:03.105]  AmericanPrinceMovie.com.
[01:50:03.145 --> 01:50:05.666]  Be sure and check it out today.
[01:50:05.706 --> 01:50:07.866]  We've got it up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:08.206 --> 01:50:12.007]  Rebroadcast starts now in about a minute and a half with Jason Burmus and a ton of news.
[01:50:12.067 --> 01:50:17.189]  The show starts with an audio blog I did with local, well, national media that I thought was quite informative.
[01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:18.509]  Some of the bullhorning we did on the street.
[01:50:18.869 --> 01:50:24.391]  So that's coming up right now in the retransmission at InfoWars.com and on the podcast and on AM and FM's everywhere.
[01:50:24.691 --> 01:50:26.831]  Tommy Pallotta, American Prince the Movie.
[01:50:26.891 --> 01:50:28.132]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:28.652]  Thank you.
[01:50:30.488 --> 01:50:32.929]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're out of time.
[01:50:33.009 --> 01:50:35.711]  As I said, retransmission starts now in 70 seconds.
[01:50:36.111 --> 01:50:37.512]  OnePlaceInfoWars.com.
[01:50:37.532 --> 01:50:38.432]  See you back live tomorrow.
[01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:39.132]  God bless.
[01:50:43.134 --> 01:50:44.695]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:50:50.814 --> 01:50:52.375]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:52.515 --> 01:50:57.136]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:57.236 --> 01:50:59.997]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:00.197 --> 01:51:03.058]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:03.238 --> 01:51:07.960]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.121]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:09.321 --> 01:51:12.284]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:12.564 --> 01:51:19.470]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
