[00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:09.638]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.638 --> 00:00:11.219]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.780]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.982]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:21.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.641]  We are live, my friends.
[00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:40.104]  Thank you for joining us on this 28th day of October 2009, Wednesday edition.
[00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:43.765]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours today.
[00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:50.188]  Masses of vital news and information to cover, your phone calls and to guests.
[00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:54.991]  We had him on about three weeks ago, and I want to have him back on to take your questions.
[00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.252]  He's Hilmer von Kampy.
[00:00:58.152 --> 00:00:59.975]  He was a Hitler youth.
[00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:03.960]  His brother died in the war.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.547]  He was a Hitler youth from the early 1930s when Hitler came to power.
[00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:12.332]  He served in the German army during World War II.
[00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:30.137]  And we will break down the similarities, the parallels between the United States and the Western world for that matter, and the police state, the surveillance, the worship of government, the worship of the military, the worship of police, and the parallels that we're facing as a society.
[00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:42.464]  This attitude of, you've got to do what the government says, the government is the authority, it knows best, it's doing it for your own interest, versus what the founders said, government is deadly dangerous and anytime it gets big, it is going to become
[00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:47.147]  Very corrupt and is going to abuse you very, very badly.
[00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:53.771]  Daryl Rundus will be joining us in studio to talk about a host of issues and different news items and issues.
[00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:59.974]  And throughout the radio broadcast, just like yesterday, we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:03.416]  In fact, I am going to go even further.
[00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:08.439]  We're going to do a blitz of phone calls on the other side of this quick break.
[00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.240]  I am going to take
[00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:15.129]  12 phone calls in the 12-minute segment.
[00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.571]  I guess it's more than a 12-minute segment.
[00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.952]  I guess it's a... No, it's a 12-minute segment.
[00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:26.414]  In the 12-minute segment coming up, I will take 12 phone calls.
[00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:30.658]  And then in the next five-minute segment, I will take five phone calls.
[00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:55.092]  And in the segment after that, I will take a phone call every minute, or it will average out to every minute of live transmission time that we have, because I love the different perspectives, the ideas, the angles, the wildcard news articles and items or personal observations that listeners raise here on this radio broadcast.
[00:02:55.652 --> 00:03:05.874]  So we're gonna be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:06.474]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:11.255]  First-time callers will go to the head of the line today.
[00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:16.737]  As first-time callers come in, I will put them to the head of the line, but we do have open phones.
[00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:17.737]  But here's the deal.
[00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:22.458]  If we're going to be able to get to your calls, we need you to be focused, to the point,
[00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:33.847]  Lined up on the starting line, so when you hear the start pistol, that's when they go to your call, you'll hear a click.
[00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:35.629]  That's the signal you're on the air.
[00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:45.598]  Have your point, your comment, your question ready, and I will limit my responses and answers to one-line answers or one-line responses.
[00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:49.631]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.173]  This is not the new format of the radio show.
[00:03:52.173 --> 00:03:57.358]  This is how I started my radio show off almost 14 years ago.
[00:03:57.358 --> 00:04:01.702]  And how I did start my AXS TV show out 14 years ago.
[00:04:01.702 --> 00:04:01.962]  But...
[00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:04.932]  I do want to shake the broadcast up.
[00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:05.673]  It's expanding.
[00:04:05.673 --> 00:04:07.154]  A lot of new Aminathem affiliates.
[00:04:07.154 --> 00:04:08.695]  A lot of new listeners.
[00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:10.056]  We're also going to news blitz.
[00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:13.499]  I'm going to pause throughout the show to go over the news.
[00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.981]  And I have three big vital stacks in front of me.
[00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:19.924]  I will briefly mention when we start the next segment.
[00:04:20.717 --> 00:04:26.481]  What some of the top stories are today and what we're facing as a society, what I believe is most important.
[00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:35.788]  We will then go to your phone calls and then Daryl Rundis in studio with open phones yet again and Hilmer von Kampay as well.
[00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:54.614]  Today, the former Hitler Youth and German soldier under Adolf Alois Hitler and the parallels with the rapidly expanding parasitical state controlled by private interest robbing and looting society in an orgy of corruption.
[00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:56.316]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.077]  Fall Republic is out.
[00:04:58.077 --> 00:04:58.577]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:03.783]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:09.106]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:11.147]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.147 --> 00:05:16.149]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.330]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.470]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.351]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:21.412]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:23.613]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:24.973]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:26.274]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:31.741]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:35.346]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.346 --> 00:05:39.151]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:40.393]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:41.294]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.294 --> 00:05:42.396]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:43.337]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.337 --> 00:05:44.138]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:47.460]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.561]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:54.984]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:56.325]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:56.325 --> 00:06:01.968]  Day.
[00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:05.990]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.232]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:10.653]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.022]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:20.408]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.408 --> 00:06:25.592]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.592 --> 00:06:35.600]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.062]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:39.644]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:42.106]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:44.229]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.374]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:58.503]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:05.140]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.485]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:15.232]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:15.572]  It's true.
[00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:15.972]  True.
[00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:21.654]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:25.235]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:29.957]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:32.718]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:36.039]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:41.321]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:46.383]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:50.565]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:52.346]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:56.868]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:05.883]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.883 --> 00:08:08.244]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:14.406]  Thank you for joining us on this Wednesday, the 28th day of October 2009.
[00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:21.668]  Wide open phones throughout the transmission today.
[00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.769]  In my stack of news,
[00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:35.217]  Barack Obama is going to sign the hate crimes bill that they sell as a compassionate
[00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:46.494]  Peace of legislation to stop haters going out and rolling people, as it's called, beating them up and taking their money.
[00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:49.096]  A common practice and it is abhorrent.
[00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:54.520]  Oh, it's okay if we go out and mug people who we don't like.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.342]  But there are laws against assault.
[00:08:57.342 --> 00:09:03.726]  And if you really hurt somebody, it can be billed as assault with a deadly weapon or attempted murder.
[00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:04.607]  We have laws.
[00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:05.427]  We have 50 states
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:24.288]  And they tried to pass the hate crime legislation previously by saying they drug a black man to death in Jasper, Texas, year after year for the last, what, that happened about six years ago, seven years ago?
[00:09:24.288 --> 00:09:28.610]  They tried to pass it saying, he needs to be punished.
[00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:36.374]  And the national media would never mention in the thousands of news reports over the years.
[00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:37.455]  It had to be in the thousands.
[00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:47.313]  I mean, you all saw it every day sometimes for months whenever they were trying to pass hate crimes legislation.
[00:09:47.313 --> 00:10:05.397]  Of course, the white trash individual that did this was a ex-con who had been beaten up and raped by the black gangs in the prisons.
[00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.577]  Fellow trash.
[00:10:10.723 --> 00:10:15.839]  And so he got together with some other ex-cons.
[00:10:17.407 --> 00:10:23.571]  And they drug an old, drunk, black hobo man to death and his head came off.
[00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:31.036]  Now, none of the media mentioned that this individual was given the death penalty by the state of Texas.
[00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:33.717]  The death penalty!
[00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.298]  What more can you do?
[00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:37.019]  The death penalty!
[00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:38.720]  And he certainly did deserve it.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.663]  In fact, the individuals, there were multiple individuals that did it, they were all given the death penalty.
[00:10:43.663 --> 00:10:45.845]  What else should have been done?
[00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:52.253]  But the media lied and put it out there like they hadn't been punished, nothing had happened.
[00:10:52.253 --> 00:10:59.818]  This is all about the federal government getting involved in crimes and taking over the states.
[00:10:59.818 --> 00:11:12.907]  And now, this expands the federal offices that have been opened in every city and every major town, and even in rural areas they have federal offices over multi-counties, to begin to have police
[00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:16.843]  Charge people for their political views.
[00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:21.686]  And if you hurt someone's feelings, they want to charge you.
[00:11:21.686 --> 00:11:29.450]  Some of the more egregious sections of the bill were stripped because they were exposed here on this radio show and many others.
[00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:38.036]  But the problem is, they have added to the debate, don't worry Democrats, go ahead and vote for it, we can just add that in later.
[00:11:39.704 --> 00:11:47.665]  The Democrats right now are under a lot of pressure on a similar piece of legislation, the health care plan.
[00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:48.287]  There are more than 40
[00:11:51.638 --> 00:12:00.682]  Democrats who consider themselves conservative, or the Blue Dog Democrats, not the Yellow Dog, who are saying we don't want state-sponsored paid-for abortion.
[00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:06.024]  And Nancy Pelosi has said this is essential to reduce world population and unwanted babies.
[00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:07.805]  A eugenics statement.
[00:12:07.805 --> 00:12:08.625]  That's who she is.
[00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:10.566]  It's what she stands for.
[00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:12.747]  And so right now the health care plan is in trouble because 40
[00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:18.271]  Plus, they're wavering between 45 and 41.
[00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:24.254]  40 plus Democrats are saying they may not vote for it because it will take taxpayer money and pay for abortions.
[00:12:26.578 --> 00:12:32.663]  And whether you support abortion or not, I mean, should you make someone pay for something they don't want to pay for morally?
[00:12:32.663 --> 00:12:33.884]  Certainly not.
[00:12:33.884 --> 00:12:41.570]  And the Democrats are saying, don't worry, we'll go ahead and pass it and then we can just add it in later or have the bureaucracy change its rules later.
[00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:48.175]  And they're involved in a bunch of chicanery and manipulation of the fine wording of that right now, so that's happening.
[00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:50.930]  And they've said that with the hate crime legislation.
[00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:58.673]  They've said, look, we're going to go ahead and federalize your local police and then we can add in more free speech destroying provisions later.
[00:12:58.673 --> 00:13:02.994]  So this is the death by increments situation that we're facing.
[00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:04.655]  We'll go over that as well.
[00:13:04.655 --> 00:13:14.318]  But a very sad day for the First Amendment in this country and a very sad day for the 10th and 9th Amendment dealing with state sovereignty.
[00:13:14.318 --> 00:13:18.340]  But already many states have hate crime legislation they've passed.
[00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:24.278]  But it's been ruled unconstitutional because it's not equal protection under the law.
[00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:27.781]  Now, something else happened four years ago.
[00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:46.313]  Several years after the poor black convict was drugged to death by other convicts, three drunk black men in Jasper
[00:13:48.154 --> 00:13:53.668]  Grabbed an old white man and drug him to death, thinking, oh well, you know, they killed a black guy, we'll randomly kill.
[00:13:54.815 --> 00:13:55.895]  A white guy.
[00:13:55.895 --> 00:14:02.157]  And that was in the Associated Press and in the local Jasper paper, but nowhere else.
[00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:04.038]  It was never in the news.
[00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:06.378]  Now that is political correctness.
[00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:09.459]  That is hate speech.
[00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:12.260]  That is how all of this is selectively enforced.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:19.122]  And the federal government is stating they want laws like Canada has, where you can't even read many Bible passages.
[00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:44.078]  Saying that they're hateful or you can't criticize the European Union or you can't criticize global carbon taxes.
[00:14:44.078 --> 00:14:50.059]  So this is just some of the issues that we're dealing with today and all of this multiculturalism
[00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:55.169]  It is all meant...
[00:14:56.192 --> 00:15:13.023]  To divide everyone and to point out our differences and to get everyone at each other's throats and then the federal government will arbitrate all of this and stir up the pot and all the infighting so that we never talk about the ruling elite, we never talk about the banks, we never talk about the true power structure, we all just fight over resources.
[00:15:13.023 --> 00:15:20.108]  First the government communalizes resources, then it doles them out to select groups and plays everyone off against each other.
[00:15:20.108 --> 00:15:25.952]  Very similar to the program that was used over several hundred years in defeating the Native Americans who outnumbered
[00:15:26.712 --> 00:15:34.379]  It's also in the New York Times of all places that, oh, guess what?
[00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:39.424]  A top opium producer in Afghanistan, the top opium producer, brother of Mohammed Karzai,
[00:15:53.777 --> 00:15:55.338]  is on the CIA payroll.
[00:15:55.338 --> 00:15:59.081]  Oh my gosh, is the CIA involved in opium?
[00:15:59.081 --> 00:15:59.541]  I don't know.
[00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:00.942]  Do birds fly?
[00:16:00.942 --> 00:16:02.824]  Do ducks quack?
[00:16:02.824 --> 00:16:05.345]  I mean, this is just asinine.
[00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.447]  So we'll be breaking that down and a bunch of other news.
[00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:09.448]  More world government announcements taking place.
[00:16:09.448 --> 00:16:10.949]  Josh in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:13.952]  Welcome.
[00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:15.092]  Hey, Alex.
[00:16:15.092 --> 00:16:16.153]  Welcome.
[00:16:16.153 --> 00:16:16.714]  How you doing?
[00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:17.754]  I love you, bro.
[00:16:17.754 --> 00:16:19.295]  I love all you guys.
[00:16:19.295 --> 00:16:19.876]  You guys are
[00:16:20.686 --> 00:16:25.350]  An inspiration to humanity, keep up the excellent work.
[00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:39.140]  Just wanted to call, have a couple of pig flu stories for you, but your fall republic was just like totally jam-packed with information.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:44.745]  There was a caller who was pulling sound off and copying it to the internet.
[00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:49.909]  I think that's a great way for everyone to get more of this information out.
[00:16:50.570 --> 00:17:16.014]  Um, and I, uh, a little nervous, but, um, I think that, you know, and you've mentioned this before, if we can take everything that this, uh, global, uh, elite structure is, is pinning against us and, you know, do a switcheroo and use everything that they're trying to pin us down with against them,
[00:17:17.116 --> 00:17:42.495]  You know, I mean, if they want a global world currency and power structure or government, then why don't we take the framework of the Constitution, the United States, the Bill of Rights, and turn that into the global model and run with all their programs into pushing the real
[00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:51.355]  The problem is, and I hear you Josh and I appreciate your call, the establishment, the controllers, the social engineers, they built the structure.
[00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:53.537]  The world government's already in place.
[00:17:53.537 --> 00:17:55.379]  They're just announcing it now to everyone.
[00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:58.021]  While they were building it, they denied it existed.
[00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:01.384]  Now, they've unveiled it and it's exactly what we said it was.
[00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:05.668]  Down to the finest detail, because we were only reading their public blueprints.
[00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:09.271]  Their operations are public, they just weren't publicized.
[00:18:10.814 --> 00:18:13.196]  Let's talk to John in New Jersey.
[00:18:13.196 --> 00:18:14.497]  John, you're on the air.
[00:18:14.497 --> 00:18:15.157]  Yeah.
[00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:16.539]  Greetings, Alex.
[00:18:16.539 --> 00:18:26.647]  Yeah, a follower of the Republic is certainly arming me and giving me power and knowledge, and I salute you.
[00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:27.307]  Well, I salute you.
[00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:28.248]  What's on your mind?
[00:18:28.248 --> 00:18:36.414]  Well, you know, I lost my job two months ago, and I'm currently unemployed, but I want to pay off all my bills.
[00:18:36.414 --> 00:18:37.115]  My wife and I
[00:18:38.755 --> 00:18:41.897]  We have an obligation and we want to pay off all our bills.
[00:19:09.494 --> 00:19:24.211]  That gets counted as income, by the way, if the credit card companies say, look, we'll settle for this amount of money, but we're going to have to report the rest of the balance to the IRS and you'll have to deal with them.
[00:19:24.642 --> 00:19:33.990]  Yes, everything is designed to keep you in the market and to keep you from spending your own money, and to penalize you if you try to get out of debt.
[00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:43.477]  And on top of all this, Barack Obama's reform of the credit card industry is to let them have 30% interest rates on people that have paid their bills.
[00:19:43.477 --> 00:19:47.421]  And so, they've got you between a rock and a hard place, and that is their plan.
[00:19:48.484 --> 00:19:50.488]  Anything else, John?
[00:19:50.488 --> 00:19:57.861]  Just keep it up, Alex, because the information you're arming me with just makes me a better person each and every day, and God bless America.
[00:19:57.861 --> 00:19:58.482]  Take care, John.
[00:20:00.509 --> 00:20:02.690]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:03.551]  Spy on me?
[00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:03.871]  Yeah.
[00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:08.914]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:10.555]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:11.295]  Startpage?
[00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.796]  Yeah, Startpage.com.

[00:21:38.482 --> 00:21:38.762]  I think so.
[00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:01.361]  You worry.
[00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:03.422]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:06.083]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:08.204]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:22:08.204 --> 00:22:09.805]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:22:09.805 --> 00:22:13.386]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:22:13.386 --> 00:22:18.649]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:21.950]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:22:22.605 --> 00:22:24.287]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:22:24.287 --> 00:22:27.209]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:30.652]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:22:30.652 --> 00:22:39.300]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:44.124]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:52.855]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:22:52.855 --> 00:22:54.918]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:23:01.184 --> 00:23:11.067]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:23:11.067 --> 00:23:13.128]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:23:13.128 --> 00:23:16.729]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:29.874]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:23:30.254 --> 00:23:30.774]  I don't know.
[00:24:04.048 --> 00:24:11.334]  Continuing with wide open telephones, big news blitz coming up in the middle of the next segment at 40 After.
[00:24:11.334 --> 00:24:13.695]  Cover all the top stories in detail.
[00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:16.117]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Colorado.
[00:24:16.117 --> 00:24:17.118]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:24:17.118 --> 00:24:18.499]  Thanks for holding.
[00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:20.481]  Mr. Jones, good to talk to you, sir.
[00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:22.082]  You're a warrior.
[00:24:22.082 --> 00:24:22.662]  Good to talk to you.
[00:24:22.662 --> 00:24:24.124]  What's on your mind?
[00:24:24.124 --> 00:24:32.390]  Okay, I just got recently exposed to a couple guys that are called the Yes Men.
[00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.691]  The Yes Men are a
[00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:52.145]  They're filmmakers who go around pulling stunts, showing how corrupt society is.
[00:24:52.145 --> 00:25:01.310]  Yeah, that's right, and I consider myself a fairly awake individual, and I'm very taken in by these guys, but they subversively support
[00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:26.843]  Yes, the controlled left is putting out all sorts of activists that try to mimic what we do and try to counterfeit so is the controlled right with people like Glenn Beck because they know they've got a revolution on their hands so they need to be able to cover the field and cover all the bases
[00:25:27.423 --> 00:25:28.604]  Yeah, I was totally taken in by it.
[00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:34.408]  I was putting up their videos on YouTube and Facebook and then I looked into it a little bit and I was like, wow, these guys are not who I thought they were.
[00:25:52.125 --> 00:26:13.818]  Well that's just like George Soros is leading the fight against the bankers when he's one of the kingpins and they have a MSNBC show on in the morning that talks about the bankers looting and robbing us, but then they go on to support the carbon treaty and national health care and sell it as if the banks are against it when the banks are the ones that have written up the entire plan to take over our lives.
[00:26:13.818 --> 00:26:20.282]  So yes, you've got to really investigate the full spectrum of what an organization or media outlet is pushing.
[00:26:20.282 --> 00:26:21.423]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[00:26:21.983 --> 00:26:25.006]  Caroline in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:26:25.006 --> 00:26:26.767]  Yes, good morning, Mr. Alex.
[00:26:26.767 --> 00:26:28.929]  I pray to God for you every day.
[00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:30.510]  You are my hero.
[00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.933]  You woke me up, and I thank you so much for everything you've done.
[00:26:33.933 --> 00:26:36.094]  Thank you.
[00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:43.320]  I wanted to just make a comment, especially about vaccines, and I have a reason for this.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.584]  My brother just, my brother died at the end of June.
[00:26:48.377 --> 00:26:51.060]  And it was a real all of a sudden thing.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:27:01.070]  He started getting sinus problems and he started having some physical problems and they finally brought him to the hospital.
[00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:09.378]  I could not figure out what was going on until the very end when he got diagnosed with T cell lymphoma.
[00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:11.420]  We have no idea where it came from.
[00:27:12.442 --> 00:27:14.304]  Well, a lot of it comes from the vaccines.
[00:27:14.304 --> 00:27:17.648]  That's why cancers, many types, are up over 2,000%.
[00:27:17.648 --> 00:27:19.750]  Dale Dudley, the local 93.7 host.
[00:27:22.335 --> 00:27:39.360]  took a flu vaccine and within months, his hands were becoming paralyzed, he couldn't hold a pen, he was having trouble walking, his whole body was numb, and now his toe, his words are, my toe is dead.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.683]  And he finally went to all these specialists, medical doctors, and they said, you had the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome,
[00:27:47.863 --> 00:27:53.967]  And the only thing that could have done it was the vaccine, but he's now recovered, except for his toe.
[00:27:53.967 --> 00:27:58.350]  His big toe is just completely numb and paralyzed.
[00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.392]  And this happens to people that take the shots.
[00:28:01.392 --> 00:28:08.157]  And they get cancer, and they get brain damage, and they get eczema, and they get autoimmune disorders, and they get allergies.
[00:28:08.157 --> 00:28:10.739]  And all the medical research shows it.
[00:28:10.739 --> 00:28:13.581]  The medical inserts say it can do it to you.
[00:28:14.501 --> 00:28:16.362]  And it is eugenics.
[00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:22.903]  And so people are getting maimed and debilitated and handicapped and killed all around us.
[00:28:22.903 --> 00:28:23.884]  That's right.
[00:28:23.884 --> 00:28:38.227]  And the thing is, the one question, the first question I asked my dad, right after he gave me the news, was, Dad, did you and my brother Gray, did you both get flu shots?
[00:28:38.227 --> 00:28:39.648]  And he says, yes we did.
[00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:41.048]  We did at the beginning of the year.
[00:28:41.048 --> 00:28:42.949]  We always do that.
[00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:44.069]  And I'm just
[00:28:44.952 --> 00:28:50.970]  My heart just sank because also my mom had breast cancer.
[00:28:51.821 --> 00:28:59.905]  And she was an avid flu shot taker, an avid vaccine taker, along with my father.
[00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:02.747]  Well, ma'am, let me tell you what's going on.
[00:29:02.747 --> 00:29:03.987]  Don't believe me.
[00:29:03.987 --> 00:29:07.429]  Go to the German news, Bild, Der Spiegel.
[00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:18.515]  All in the last month, top virologists, top geneticists, top medical doctors with multiple medical degrees at major top institutes.
[00:29:19.495 --> 00:29:27.403]  Are saying the vaccines all have cancer viruses in them.
[00:29:27.403 --> 00:29:35.291]  And they know the polio vaccine killed tens of millions alone in the US with the virus.
[00:29:36.405 --> 00:29:38.086]  Simeon Virus 40.
[00:29:38.086 --> 00:29:38.906]  They know it.
[00:29:38.906 --> 00:29:41.367]  And I'm so sad for you, Caroline.
[00:29:41.367 --> 00:29:44.168]  There's a good chance they did kill your brother.
[00:29:44.168 --> 00:29:48.790]  And just like Reuters came out and said, oh, a lot of people are going to be dying after the shot.
[00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.211]  But it's not the shot.
[00:29:51.211 --> 00:29:52.612]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.612 --> 00:29:55.133]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:57.834]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.466]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.466 --> 00:30:09.991]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:12.274]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.274 --> 00:30:13.896]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:14.937]  There is a solution.

[00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:05.955]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.955 --> 00:31:09.196]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.196 --> 00:31:10.596]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.323 --> 00:31:14.005]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:20.391]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.391 --> 00:31:25.935]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.935 --> 00:31:35.563]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.683 --> 00:31:38.024]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.024 --> 00:31:39.624]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.624 --> 00:31:42.065]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.065 --> 00:31:43.925]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:43.925 --> 00:31:49.346]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.346 --> 00:31:54.348]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:32:06.886 --> 00:32:18.631]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[00:32:18.631 --> 00:32:21.712]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[00:32:21.712 --> 00:32:27.154]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:32:31.403 --> 00:32:36.124]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.

[00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:43.907]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.

[00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:23.069]  The whole point of government-run healthcare is eugenics.
[00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:28.758]  It is to restrict care to the old, to the infirm, to handicaps.
[00:33:28.758 --> 00:33:30.140]  This is all stated.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.121]  It's done in England.
[00:33:31.121 --> 00:33:32.083]  It's done in Canada.
[00:33:33.499 --> 00:33:47.625]  The individual who is going to be the head of Health and Human Services, former Senator John Daschle, wrote in his own best-selling book quotes where they talked about rationing care and how people above 60 don't deserve to have eye surgery.
[00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:53.247]  They wait years in many cases in England for treatable cancer surgeries.
[00:33:53.247 --> 00:33:54.208]  It is a fact
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:07.953]  That they communalize your wealth, they tax you at a higher rate, the money is laundered through the banks, and they basically give you an aspirin for a heart attack.
[00:34:07.953 --> 00:34:13.358]  But now, a Michigan Democrat is saying Pelosi is not happy with him, Representative Bart
[00:34:14.378 --> 00:34:31.418]  Stupak said Speaker Pelosi is not pleased with his efforts to change abortion-related provisions in the health care bill crafted by the House, and now more than 40 House Democrats are saying they're not going to vote for it if they don't put a provision in there that there's no government funding for abortion.
[00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:41.611]  Forcing the public, the population who is against abortion, to pay for it.
[00:34:41.611 --> 00:34:44.836]  And they do this at the county, city, and state level all over the nation.
[00:34:44.836 --> 00:34:52.027]  And it's just absolutely immoral to force people to pay for other people to kill their children.
[00:34:53.387 --> 00:34:55.809]  It's just absolutely abhorrent.
[00:34:55.809 --> 00:35:02.694]  And I wanted to go back to a couple months ago when Nancy Pelosi was honest about how we don't need these unwanted babies.
[00:35:02.694 --> 00:35:04.135]  We're going to save money.
[00:35:04.135 --> 00:35:09.799]  With less people on earth, we're going to have lower healthcare costs.
[00:35:09.799 --> 00:35:11.400]  And that's the mindset.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:20.667]  The establishment, the control freaks, the eugenicists, want to freeze society and society's development and then start dismantling our industries.
[00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:21.768]  This is UN statements.
[00:35:22.878 --> 00:35:38.967]  By the head of the Biological Diversity Assessment Team for the UN, Maurice Strong, 1992, Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, and he stated, it is our job at the United Nations to destroy industrialized society and reduce world population.
[00:35:38.967 --> 00:35:40.808]  You can go read his quotes.
[00:35:40.808 --> 00:35:48.512]  You can watch Maurice Strong on television, on YouTube, in TV interview after TV interview, saying, get rid of babies.
[00:35:48.512 --> 00:35:49.893]  Euthanize people.
[00:35:49.893 --> 00:35:51.594]  Reduce the world population.
[00:35:53.106 --> 00:36:03.212]  And so the idea they have is, socialize the wealth, get everybody on the government dole, and then say, oh, you'll get better health care, and pit groups against each other.
[00:36:03.212 --> 00:36:06.914]  You'll get more health care if we can just have less people.
[00:36:06.914 --> 00:36:10.676]  As if less people means better services, a better life.
[00:36:12.372 --> 00:36:14.294]  It's all about divide and conquer.
[00:36:14.294 --> 00:36:21.020]  Dividing different groups against each other and the establishment is the referee, is the arbiter over it all.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.942]  It's all about divide and conquer.
[00:36:22.942 --> 00:36:27.246]  Nancy Pelosi says birth control will help the US economy.
[00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:28.067]  Less babies.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.301]  Means a better economy, which is a lie on its face.
[00:36:32.301 --> 00:36:38.142]  More babies means a younger population to pay for the aging population.
[00:36:38.142 --> 00:36:44.704]  We are the oldest society in human history and it's only going to accelerate over the next 30 years.
[00:36:44.704 --> 00:36:46.504]  We are the oldest society.
[00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:56.767]  We have a lopsided society because our grandparents and parents, up until the 1960s, had an average of four children.
[00:36:57.765 --> 00:36:59.386]  In some regions, more.
[00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:06.710]  We now have an average of 1.3 children in the United States, if you pull out the influx of immigrant populations.
[00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:15.236]  Or at 1.9, even if you count the 3 million illegal aliens and 1 million legals that come in to replace our dying population.
[00:37:15.236 --> 00:37:19.558]  Worldwide, from Japan to Germany to England, there is a 1.3 population
[00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.591]  Increase, which is a reduction.
[00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:30.554]  For every two people born, they are only replacing themselves at 1.3.
[00:37:30.554 --> 00:37:37.338]  So how is aborting more babies going to replace the population?
[00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:51.947]  Did you know that the indigenous black population, by indigenous, Africans brought here in the last 400 years in the transatlantic slave trade, there are more black babies in the last decade running
[00:37:53.302 --> 00:37:55.163]  You can look up the national statistics.
[00:37:55.163 --> 00:37:59.424]  More black babies are aborted than are born.
[00:37:59.424 --> 00:38:04.666]  So how have blacks gone from 11% of the population to 12 in the last decade?
[00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:14.309]  Massive African influx from Nigeria, from Somalia, from South Africa, the list goes on and on as Africa implodes.
[00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:19.711]  So blacks, blacks who've lived here for hundreds of years are dying as well.
[00:38:21.223 --> 00:38:24.425]  And they're only being replaced with true Africans.
[00:38:24.425 --> 00:38:30.789]  Originally, their ancestors in the last 300-400 years weren't from the U.S.
[00:38:30.789 --> 00:38:35.473]  They are immigrants directly from the continent of Africa.
[00:38:35.473 --> 00:38:42.197]  So we're not even replacing our numbers, and Nancy Pelosi is running around saying that
[00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:49.947]  We need to have less babies and more abortion is good for the economy.
[00:38:49.947 --> 00:38:58.131]  I mean, even if you're for abortion and think it's a wonderful right you have and a great thing and, you know, don't use birth control, just go have a risky procedure.
[00:38:58.131 --> 00:39:06.555]  Go in there and somebody can just use a vacuum cleaner and some knives or pump some salts in and burn the baby to death as it struggles and fights for its life.
[00:39:06.555 --> 00:39:10.957]  And they have tens of thousands every year of partial birth abortions in the ninth month.
[00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:22.215]  And then hundreds and hundreds of people have been saved and dug out of trash cans by pro-lifers and are now famous speakers speaking out against it.
[00:39:22.215 --> 00:39:28.502]  I mean, they could even adopt the baby, even though there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are abortions.
[00:39:28.502 --> 00:39:32.166]  That's why we again import from South Korea.
[00:39:33.922 --> 00:39:39.006]  And the Middle East, and Asia, and Europe, babies.
[00:39:39.006 --> 00:39:41.567]  Many of them kidnapped from their parents by CPS.
[00:39:41.567 --> 00:39:44.389]  That's the big dirty secret in Europe and Russia.
[00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:46.411]  Because people want babies.
[00:39:46.411 --> 00:39:51.815]  But they can't get them from the abortuaries because they need to be used so their retinas can be ripped out.
[00:39:51.815 --> 00:39:55.597]  And I'm sorry to have to talk like this, ladies and gentlemen, but this is what's going on.
[00:39:55.597 --> 00:40:00.461]  Even if you're for abortion, you need to know.
[00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.902]  See, oh, I don't want to hear about it,
[00:40:03.396 --> 00:40:12.109]  It's one thing to use dog kidneys or monkey kidneys to breed the viruses for the vaccines, but it's another thing to use
[00:40:15.678 --> 00:40:25.504]  Insect cells, because that gives you insect mutagens, insect bacteria, microplasms, and viruses.
[00:40:25.504 --> 00:40:32.889]  And now in the last few years, they've discovered even smaller viruses and even smaller bacteria inside the viruses, inside the bacteria.
[00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:34.930]  That all gets bred up and injected into you.
[00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.052]  If you don't care about your health, that's your business, I guess.
[00:40:38.052 --> 00:40:41.174]  Though it mutates in your own body and then you spread it.
[00:40:41.174 --> 00:40:43.616]  But we have to add to that equation
[00:40:46.826 --> 00:40:54.069]  That they're taking baby retinas as their favorite shell line for cloning these viruses.
[00:40:54.069 --> 00:41:00.892]  For some reason, fetal retinas are the best system.
[00:41:00.892 --> 00:41:03.393]  Fetal retinas.
[00:41:03.393 --> 00:41:08.495]  Human beings devalued down to the point where we're like produce.
[00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:14.338]  We're like an eggplant, or a squash, or a piece of chicken you buy at the store, or a gallon of milk.
[00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:25.901]  We've been completely dehumanized and we're being trained that euthanasia is good, government forced euthanasia, killing people that don't even want to die, going on all over the world.
[00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:41.970]  The Chinese government with 24 mobile execution vans in every one of their major cities, per city, driving around, killing political dissidents, selling their organs, keeping people in prisons, blood typing them.
[00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:42.851]  Falun Gong.
[00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:49.125]  Buddhist, Christians, and our media doesn't do exposés on it.
[00:41:49.125 --> 00:41:51.166]  Our supposed media doesn't talk about it.
[00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.528]  They don't discuss it.
[00:41:53.528 --> 00:42:02.595]  They just say, oh, a young gay man was beaten up and then he committed suicide, pulling on heartstrings.
[00:42:02.595 --> 00:42:03.596]  They don't tell you the government.
[00:42:04.753 --> 00:42:09.478]  In the hepatitis shots in gay men, it's been declassified, gave them HIV.
[00:42:09.478 --> 00:42:10.238]  Oh, no.
[00:42:10.238 --> 00:42:18.406]  They just make everybody feel sorry and say, oh, we need to federalize local police and restrict the First Amendment.
[00:42:18.406 --> 00:42:21.870]  See, it's all manipulation, all lies.
[00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:29.137]  But here is Nancy Pelosi, with Stephanopoulos, on national television,
[00:42:30.811 --> 00:42:35.398]  Saying that abortion will save us money and help the U.S.
[00:42:35.398 --> 00:42:43.350]  economy when every index and every economic data point you look at proves
[00:42:44.434 --> 00:42:48.737]  That we need a massive population explosion.
[00:42:48.737 --> 00:42:54.102]  We need people to be having at least four children to pay for all the old people.
[00:42:54.102 --> 00:43:04.190]  All you stupid baby boomers that are 55, 60 and are arrogant right now and you're running around as trendies who are for euthanasia and socialist healthcare.
[00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:08.974]  You have no idea you're destroying your own future and that you're going to be euthanized.
[00:43:08.974 --> 00:43:10.255]  You have no idea!
[00:43:12.014 --> 00:43:20.641]  You have no idea what you're part of, and you're cheerleading and putting down anybody.
[00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:26.727]  You're cheerleading for not having more than one child, that they have a big carbon footprint, and babies are bad for the earth.
[00:43:26.727 --> 00:43:29.209]  Literally thousands of news articles saying it.
[00:43:29.209 --> 00:43:37.376]  Constantly in every publication I see, every major newsstand I walk up to, the message is on the cover of magazines everywhere, babies are bad.
[00:43:39.608 --> 00:43:46.376]  Come up to women in grocery stores that have three, four, five kids and get in their face and say, you're a breeder, you're hurting the environment.
[00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:47.817]  Arrogant control freaks.
[00:43:47.817 --> 00:43:51.702]  Who do you think's going to pay the taxes for you slugs?
[00:43:51.702 --> 00:43:55.406]  Oh, you'll bring in the third world population.
[00:43:55.406 --> 00:43:57.629]  That's what you're going to do.
[00:43:57.629 --> 00:44:00.051]  Let's go ahead and play the Nancy Pelosi clip and go back to your calls.
[00:44:01.058 --> 00:44:05.002]  Hundreds of millions of dollars to expand family planning services.
[00:44:05.002 --> 00:44:06.023]  How is that stimulus?
[00:44:06.023 --> 00:44:10.147]  Well, the family planning services reduced cost.
[00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.208]  It reduced cost.
[00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:16.713]  The states are in terrible fiscal budget crisis now.
[00:44:16.713 --> 00:44:23.799]  And part of it, what we do for children's health, education, some of those elements are to help the states
[00:44:24.893 --> 00:44:26.173]  To the state.
[00:44:26.173 --> 00:44:28.414]  Everything is the state.
[00:44:28.414 --> 00:44:31.095]  As if the federal government and that
[00:44:47.355 --> 00:44:53.077]  District of criminals up there on the Potomac as if they help us.
[00:44:53.077 --> 00:44:54.277]  They give us the money.
[00:44:54.277 --> 00:44:55.698]  It's free money.
[00:44:55.698 --> 00:44:56.638]  They send it to us.
[00:44:56.638 --> 00:45:05.241]  They take a dollar and on average they send back 30 cents with strings attached to it on how to run our lives.
[00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:11.483]  And I get to hear governors and legislature members of the different states constantly thanking the feds.
[00:45:11.483 --> 00:45:13.904]  Oh, without you what would we do?
[00:45:14.898 --> 00:45:31.648]  Without you, Nancy Pelosi, with her own Air Force One-size aircraft, and now the entire leadership of the House and Senate are getting their own full-size jets with their own private security details, Praetorian Guard, running around looting everyone.
[00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:33.550]  Oh, thank you, Pelosi.
[00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:34.910]  You make the grass grow.
[00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.692]  You make the birds sing.
[00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:40.154]  You make the sun come out during the day and the moon come out at night.
[00:45:41.167 --> 00:45:43.051]  You do everything.
[00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:48.042]  Oh Pelosi, you the godlike governor of the House of Representatives.
[00:45:48.042 --> 00:45:49.546]  What would we do without you?
[00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:51.249]  Oh, please give us more...
[00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:57.141]  Thank you, Pelosi, for all the federal funds to put schoolchildren on Ritalin and Prozac that shrinks their brains.
[00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:16.750]  Yeah, how you doing?
[00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.251]  I just had... I'm waking people up.
[00:46:18.251 --> 00:46:21.732]  I was just... Like, I go to school over here in... What's it called?
[00:46:21.732 --> 00:46:22.692]  Over in Florida, right?
[00:46:41.638 --> 00:46:45.660]  And I've talked to many different people from many different races or whatever, whatever.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.641]  And I found the best thing to waken them up is to like, what's it called?
[00:46:48.641 --> 00:46:50.642]  Like, you have to kind of like educate them.
[00:46:50.642 --> 00:46:53.704]  You have to tell them, you can't only like tell them what's going on.
[00:46:53.704 --> 00:46:57.826]  You have to tell them like, like, like how, how, how everything could be better.
[00:46:57.826 --> 00:47:05.890]  For example, like, you know, like how the government just had this, um, clash for conquer thing and it had $3 billion and it gave $4,500 to each person for a car, right?
[00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:05.950]  Yes.
[00:47:11.397 --> 00:47:12.397]  Yeah, you know they get $4,500.
[00:47:12.397 --> 00:47:12.597]  Yes.
[00:47:12.597 --> 00:47:19.700]  And you know about that solar panel thing you talk about, and all these osmosis, whatever, that can help people.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.300]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.702]  Like, how they can get, like, um, like, secure for themselves, just in case.
[00:47:24.702 --> 00:47:30.604]  You know how everybody knows something is happening, something is going to come, because I talk to my teachers and all different types of stuff.
[00:47:30.604 --> 00:47:33.465]  They know something is going to happen, but they don't know, like, what's going to happen.
[00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:33.865]  They don't know.
[00:47:34.729 --> 00:47:35.850]  Like, what's really going on?
[00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.410]  They just know that something is going to happen.
[00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:38.470]  No, that's a good point.
[00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.171]  That's a great point.
[00:47:39.171 --> 00:47:40.871]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:42.592]  Everyone knows something's wrong.
[00:47:42.592 --> 00:47:50.895]  Everyone's instincts, the evidence, everyone knows the government lies 99% of the time.
[00:47:50.895 --> 00:47:53.576]  And everyone knows we're in big trouble.
[00:47:53.576 --> 00:47:56.497]  The problem is they don't know specifically what's happening.
[00:47:56.497 --> 00:47:59.438]  That's why I made Fall of the Republic.
[00:47:59.438 --> 00:48:01.498]  That's why I made The Obama Deception.
[00:48:01.498 --> 00:48:02.639]  These two films together
[00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:15.511]  Our premier premier tools to explain who the elite are, what their power structure is, what their game plan is, how they're hurting society.
[00:48:17.156 --> 00:48:20.719]  So that people then understand the larger picture.
[00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:38.693]  That's why I hope everyone will visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I hope you'll go to the online video bookstore and order the DVD and make copies of it because it's eloquent, it's slick, it's got tons of experts, it's well done, it's the globalist in their own words.
[00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:40.694]  This is definitely my best film.
[00:48:40.694 --> 00:48:44.898]  The reviews are coming in, the most positive and rave reviews we've ever gotten.
[00:48:45.798 --> 00:48:46.979]  This is an exciting film.
[00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:53.704]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:53.704 --> 00:48:55.565]  888-253-3139.
[00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:56.846]  Please don't wait.
[00:48:56.846 --> 00:49:02.069]  Please order Fall of the Republic today and your purchase also makes this radio show possible.
[00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:06.232]  Don't just sit back and let the globalists openly set up world government.
[00:49:06.232 --> 00:49:07.633]  They are revealing themselves.
[00:49:07.633 --> 00:49:09.214]  They are showing us who they are.
[00:49:09.214 --> 00:49:13.277]  The population is ready and willing to be awakened and then to be
[00:49:15.956 --> 00:49:18.979]  Focused on fighting the New World Order.
[00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:22.283]  And for those of you that have just woken up, start waking others up.
[00:49:22.283 --> 00:49:23.445]  We don't have time.
[00:49:23.445 --> 00:49:29.071]  John in New York, you're on the air.
[00:49:29.071 --> 00:49:30.052]  Hello?
[00:49:30.052 --> 00:49:30.653]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:49:31.533 --> 00:49:32.954]  Hey, I'm John from New York.
[00:49:32.954 --> 00:49:33.715]  How are you doing?
[00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:36.939]  I've been listening to you for about two years now.
[00:49:36.939 --> 00:49:39.021]  I actually have one.
[00:49:39.021 --> 00:49:39.982]  First, I'm from New York.
[00:49:39.982 --> 00:49:41.764]  I had the mandatory vaccination.
[00:49:41.764 --> 00:49:43.345]  I worked in the IT department.
[00:49:43.345 --> 00:49:47.529]  Not even near patients, but they said you'll either get fired or take the shot.
[00:49:47.529 --> 00:49:52.575]  I refused the shot, and then luckily they put it on hold, which I think was just a cover-up.
[00:49:52.995 --> 00:49:54.215]  Well, you know why that happened?
[00:49:54.215 --> 00:49:58.637]  That's because enough people, they made you feel like you were all alone.
[00:49:58.637 --> 00:50:06.260]  At first, 60% and over 70% of New York State doctors and nurses and medical workers said no.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.541]  And so that's been all over the news this week.
[00:50:08.541 --> 00:50:12.083]  The headline, New York suspends mandatory vaccine.
[00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:18.065]  But they'll still try to lie and corner you and tell you to take it, though your supervisor probably hasn't even taken it.
[00:50:19.048 --> 00:50:26.953]  No, actually, the sad thing is everyone ran to take it for the exception of like two or three people that luckily over the year I've woken up.
[00:50:26.953 --> 00:50:31.476]  But everyone just ran to get it and then they're like, oh wait, we don't have to take it now and then they're all shitting themselves.
[00:50:31.476 --> 00:50:31.957]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:31.957 --> 00:50:34.899]  Alright, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:37.781]  It's always fun taking phone calls, isn't it?
[00:50:37.781 --> 00:50:40.903]  You know, we don't screen our calls, but
[00:50:42.734 --> 00:50:45.815]  I would ask the callers to be focused and ready to speak.
[00:50:45.815 --> 00:50:46.736]  Okay?
[00:50:46.736 --> 00:50:58.681]  I understand we're all drunk on fluoride and the rest of it, but... We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break with more of your phone calls right here on the one and the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:58.681 --> 00:50:59.321]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.985 --> 00:51:02.767]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:51:02.767 --> 00:51:04.268]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:51:04.268 --> 00:51:05.610]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.551]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:16.260]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:21.764]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:51:21.764 --> 00:51:23.565]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:51:23.565 --> 00:51:31.050]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:35.233]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.

[00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:09.242]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.242 --> 00:52:10.644]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.042]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.042 --> 00:52:20.426]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.426 --> 00:52:25.490]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:35.617]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.717 --> 00:52:38.058]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.058 --> 00:52:39.658]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.658 --> 00:52:42.119]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:44.240]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.381]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.381 --> 00:52:58.504]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:02.685 --> 00:53:05.766]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:08.386]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:53:08.386 --> 00:53:12.167]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[00:53:12.167 --> 00:53:18.868]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:53:18.868 --> 00:53:22.748]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[00:53:22.748 --> 00:53:27.109]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:29.350]  Nutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct.
[00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:30.710]  Your new comfort food.
[00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:31.530]  Incredible taste.
[00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.810]  We're good to go!
[00:54:17.315 --> 00:54:17.655]  Virgil, Mark,
[00:54:44.702 --> 00:54:48.925]  Angel, Rebel, we're going to be going to all your phone calls.
[00:54:48.925 --> 00:54:50.746]  And at 8 after, I'm going to go through all the news.
[00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:54.949]  I got sidetracked with Pelosi and government paid for abortions.
[00:54:54.949 --> 00:55:03.034]  Look, if you want these control freaks micromanaging your life and telling you what you can and can't do and rationing your health care, you need your head examined.
[00:55:04.775 --> 00:55:12.259]  But you talk to the general public who does support government-controlled health care, and it is a minority, but it's a large minority.
[00:55:12.259 --> 00:55:14.340]  It's over 40% of the population.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.320]  These are idiots.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.281]  They really think they're going to get free health care from the government.
[00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:27.826]  They really think the same government that's done thousands of chemical and biological and radiological secret tests on the people, including lethal tests, killing people,
[00:55:29.321 --> 00:55:36.587]  should now run our health care and that all the banks and bureaucracies and groups that are involved aren't going to screw us.
[00:55:36.587 --> 00:55:39.489]  Oh, NAFTA and GATT was going to be great for Detroit.
[00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:43.853]  Detroit and other major cities in the Rust Belt are imploding.
[00:55:43.853 --> 00:55:48.717]  California is a failed state, the seventh largest economy in the world.
[00:55:48.717 --> 00:55:51.179]  Everyone who's got any money is evacuating.
[00:55:52.358 --> 00:55:58.285]  Major newspapers in New York are reporting that they're having a flight of almost all of their middle class.
[00:55:58.285 --> 00:56:00.267]  They're raising hundreds of new taxes.
[00:56:00.267 --> 00:56:04.652]  Chicago, New York, they have snitch programs spying on your neighbors.
[00:56:04.652 --> 00:56:06.474]  Are they paying all their taxes?
[00:56:06.474 --> 00:56:08.996]  Does their car have all the stickers up to date?
[00:56:08.996 --> 00:56:10.338]  Call the police.
[00:56:10.338 --> 00:56:11.099]  Get a bonus.
[00:56:13.416 --> 00:56:22.769]  The biggest growth industry in the United States after prisons are people who are professional snitches who just go around tattling and ratting on people.
[00:56:22.769 --> 00:56:26.614]  Oh, my neighbor's three-year-old was in their backyard playing unattended.
[00:56:26.614 --> 00:56:29.177]  Didn't matter that mama was inside watching him out the window.
[00:56:30.373 --> 00:56:35.799]  Doesn't matter that the three-year-old is in a fenced-in playground.
[00:56:35.799 --> 00:56:38.662]  CPS comes and they take your child!
[00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:44.388]  And then they go to the government trough, and they get tens of thousands of dollars a month for keeping your child.
[00:56:44.388 --> 00:56:47.231]  Then they put your kid on drugs, and then they become a disabled child.
[00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:48.132]  They get even more money.
[00:56:48.132 --> 00:56:50.255]  And they put your child through the system.
[00:56:51.548 --> 00:57:03.392]  Rape them, drug them, do whatever they want to them, and when they're 25 years old and their mind is totally blown from anti-psychotics, they dump them out on the street, mumbling and talking to themselves in the street corner.
[00:57:03.392 --> 00:57:05.713]  Go talk to one of those people!
[00:57:05.713 --> 00:57:12.075]  Nine times out of ten, they got grabbed by the CPS when they were a little kid.
[00:57:12.075 --> 00:57:19.057]  The system sucked them dry, raped them, did everything else to them, and then dumps them out on the street, blown out, drugged out zombies.
[00:57:22.113 --> 00:57:27.299]  You talk to them and they go, I was 7 and the state took me.
[00:57:27.299 --> 00:57:30.403]  I was a happy child.
[00:57:30.403 --> 00:57:32.545]  My mother cried.
[00:57:32.545 --> 00:57:36.991]  They drugged me.
[00:57:36.991 --> 00:57:38.592]  Then they let me go when I was 24.
[00:57:47.647 --> 00:57:52.271]  I mean, it's just a giant wrecking machine.
[00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:56.355]  A giant wrecking machine savaging everyone.
[00:57:56.355 --> 00:57:58.377]  And I'm so sick of this government.
[00:57:58.377 --> 00:58:00.799]  I'm so sick of these social engineers.
[00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:09.387]  Sick of them and the disease and pestilence that they breed by design on purpose.
[00:58:13.567 --> 00:58:17.348]  We need to understand this is not just a corrupt system.
[00:58:17.348 --> 00:58:31.614]  It is a group of murderous psychopathic control freaks who enjoy hurting people and who enjoy wrecking society and who enjoy the fact that you're dumbed down and brain damaged from fluoride.
[00:58:31.614 --> 00:58:34.715]  They enjoy the fact they've implanted you with cancer viruses.
[00:58:34.715 --> 00:58:37.636]  They enjoy the feeling of power.
[00:58:37.636 --> 00:58:41.137]  It's a self-satisfied look on their face and I'd like to smash
[00:58:42.486 --> 00:58:45.088]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:50.272]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.272 --> 00:59:00.380]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.981]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:01.981 --> 00:59:03.062]  It's very real.
[00:59:03.062 --> 00:59:03.422]  I know.

[00:59:53.458 --> 00:59:55.839]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:58.561]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.163 --> 01:00:06.465]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.465 --> 01:00:08.226]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.226 --> 01:00:09.988]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.988 --> 01:00:11.570]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.132]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.132 --> 01:00:17.316]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.316 --> 01:00:21.361]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.905 --> 01:00:28.067]  We are back live, end of the second hour, wide open telephones.
[01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:33.370]  I'm going to go through the three stats of important news on the other side of this break.
[01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:39.353]  But right now, let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:00:39.353 --> 01:00:42.174]  Let's talk to Virgil in Oklahoma, then Mark and others.
[01:00:42.174 --> 01:00:43.535]  Virgil, welcome.
[01:00:43.535 --> 01:00:44.776]  Hey Alex, how's it going man?
[01:00:44.776 --> 01:00:44.976]  Good.
[01:00:45.732 --> 01:00:51.424]  I wanted to plug an idea of mine that I've got, and this is assuming the establishment gives us time to do this.
[01:00:51.424 --> 01:00:53.969]  2010 House of Representatives.
[01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:56.555]  The whole freaking thing is up for grabs.
[01:00:57.726 --> 01:01:08.495]  I'm going to be starting a website soon that will hopefully organize and motivate the population into finding real people, not career politicians, to put into these seats.
[01:01:08.495 --> 01:01:13.139]  Worst case scenario, we stop legislation, make them show their hand.
[01:01:13.139 --> 01:01:20.826]  Best case scenario, we replace the cancer that is our system and start fighting back against the banksters and all that worldwide.
[01:01:20.826 --> 01:01:22.767]  But anyway, I wanted to get your input on that.
[01:01:22.767 --> 01:01:24.489]  Thanks, man, and keep up the good work.
[01:01:25.302 --> 01:01:26.443]  Thank you.
[01:01:26.443 --> 01:01:29.586]  Big ideas start small.
[01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:40.315]  They start with the idea, and then they get rolling by someone putting that idea into action.
[01:01:40.315 --> 01:01:45.200]  And it doesn't always work, but more times than not, it does.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.066]  The idea to have the states declare sovereignty started back in the mid-90s, and it's really gaining steam today.
[01:01:53.786 --> 01:02:01.389]  The idea to audit the Fed and then abolish it has been pushed by Ron Paul for close to 30 years.
[01:02:01.389 --> 01:02:07.752]  Now we're getting down to the end of the line and it's inexorable.
[01:02:07.752 --> 01:02:15.355]  They can try to block it this year or even next year, but now people are identifying the true government, the true power structure.
[01:02:15.355 --> 01:02:18.576]  And so time is running out for the establishment.
[01:02:18.576 --> 01:02:20.937]  If you see a slick establishment politician
[01:02:23.231 --> 01:02:27.832]  Up there, and the media is pushing them, you know they're bad.
[01:02:27.832 --> 01:02:41.816]  Vote out any incumbent Democrats, any Republicans that side with them, people like Lindsey Graham, and vote for people that actually have a good platform.
[01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:43.716]  What's constitutional?
[01:02:43.716 --> 01:02:45.997]  Government is the cancer.
[01:02:45.997 --> 01:02:50.898]  No matter who you put in office, if we can't massively cut the size of government,
[01:02:53.666 --> 01:03:00.031]  The corrupt institution of government itself will continue to metastasize and grow.
[01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:03.134]  That's why government tripled under George Bush.
[01:03:03.134 --> 01:03:07.957]  Government tripled in the eight years of George W. Bush.
[01:03:07.957 --> 01:03:17.025]  It more than doubled exponentially in the first ten months of Barack Obama's administration.
[01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:21.128]  You can just search engine that term, startpage.com or Google or whatever you like.
[01:03:21.128 --> 01:03:21.789]  You can pull it up.
[01:03:22.654 --> 01:03:27.235]  Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:03:27.235 --> 01:03:29.456]  But that isn't Barack Obama doing that.
[01:03:29.456 --> 01:03:31.636]  He's just the latest frontman.
[01:03:31.636 --> 01:03:39.058]  As the total banking takeover accelerates into its final phase, everything accelerates.
[01:03:39.058 --> 01:03:41.178]  It's like a piece of paper you throw in the fire.
[01:03:41.178 --> 01:03:49.780]  The first second or two, it yellows, it browns, it blackens, it crinkles, and then suddenly it flashes into flame.
[01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:54.056]  The flashing into flame has now begun.
[01:03:54.056 --> 01:04:00.140]  The open announcements of world government, global taxes, total micromanagement, and control of your life.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:05.203]  It's all happening now.
[01:04:05.203 --> 01:04:10.046]  But the enemy is strong at this point, but also weak.
[01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.768]  Because now they are revealing themselves.
[01:04:12.768 --> 01:04:18.952]  First they said there is no world government, there is no plan for global tax, there's no such thing, the Federal Reserve isn't private.
[01:04:20.017 --> 01:04:30.981]  No, they go, yeah, it's private, and we're gonna regulate every facet of society and every facet of business, and we're setting up a bank of the world you're gonna pay your taxes to, but if you want the economy to come back, you better give in to us.
[01:04:30.981 --> 01:04:34.443]  We've got a gun to your collective heads.
[01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:39.005]  But all the yuppies and trendies, see, they were told for decades, no such thing as world government.
[01:04:41.107 --> 01:04:44.612]  They get up on TV and apologize and go, I guess world government does exist.
[01:04:44.612 --> 01:04:45.993]  Should we be for it or against it?
[01:04:45.993 --> 01:04:50.359]  And they go, I guess I'm for it because I like to feel like I'm part of the establishment.
[01:04:50.359 --> 01:04:52.382]  So I'll go ahead and say I'm for world government.
[01:04:53.646 --> 01:04:58.608]  These are pathetic, social-climbing jellyfish, and they are our enemies.
[01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:00.389]  They are the real problem.
[01:05:00.389 --> 01:05:04.931]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:05.851]  Number one.
[01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:10.133]  Number two.
[01:05:10.133 --> 01:05:15.016]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.016 --> 01:05:15.776]  It's true.
[01:05:15.776 --> 01:05:20.318]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.618 --> 01:05:21.459]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:25.042]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.042 --> 01:05:28.966]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:29.747]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.747 --> 01:05:32.510]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:36.193]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.193 --> 01:05:36.434]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:41.117]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.117 --> 01:05:46.180]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.342]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.342 --> 01:05:52.143]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:08.090]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.

[01:06:33.095 --> 01:06:35.177]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:35.177 --> 01:06:36.919]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:36.919 --> 01:06:39.461]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:39.461 --> 01:06:44.185]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.

[01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:55.035]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:10.063]  Toxins are in our foods, and chemicals are in our air.
[01:07:10.063 --> 01:07:12.325]  Chemicals are in our water supply.
[01:07:12.325 --> 01:07:18.188]  We purify our air and we purify our water, and yet we forget to purify our bodies.
[01:07:18.188 --> 01:07:23.351]  Funny, our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day.
[01:07:23.351 --> 01:07:25.253]  Isn't it time to make a change?
[01:07:25.253 --> 01:07:26.814]  Maybe a life change?
[01:07:26.814 --> 01:07:28.995]  Get rid of toxins and chemicals.

[01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:07.416]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:40.312 --> 01:08:54.904]  All right, I'm gonna go through some of the news today, and then we're going to take your phone calls, and I would hope that listeners would want to comment on some of the news items I have here in front of me today.
[01:08:54.904 --> 01:08:56.025]  The New York Times
[01:08:57.574 --> 01:09:04.276]  Calmly reports as if they're just talking about the price of motor oil.
[01:09:06.926 --> 01:09:12.891]  They just calmly report that the brother of Afghan leader is said to be on CIA payroll.
[01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:14.112]  Gee, you think so?
[01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:20.597]  I mean, Mohammad Karzai is a former UNICOL executive tied in with the State Department and the CIA.
[01:09:20.597 --> 01:09:23.460]  That entire government is a puppet government.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.842]  It's admitted it's a puppet government.
[01:09:25.842 --> 01:09:27.964]  And the people are tired of being occupied there.
[01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:44.806]  And there is always going to be civil war and death there because of the 500 plus billion dollars of raw opium that is shipped out of the nation each year.
[01:09:44.806 --> 01:09:53.429]  Over 80% of world opium is produced inside of Afghanistan.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:57.380]  The U.S.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.683]  forces guard the opium.
[01:10:00.683 --> 01:10:06.726]  And the excuse is, well, if we don't guard it and work with the warlords, they'll turn against us.
[01:10:06.726 --> 01:10:11.409]  That's how they sell our government, our media, our culture on pure evil.
[01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:23.597]  Oh yes, we're guarding it, but then if you're caught using it in Austin, Texas, or in Chicago, Illinois, you're gonna be put in prison.
[01:10:23.597 --> 01:10:24.458]  That's how this works.
[01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:27.515]  That's how this country works.
[01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:31.777]  It is the ultimate in hypocrisy.
[01:10:31.777 --> 01:10:39.840]  And they go on to admit that he is one of the biggest narcotics traffickers in the country.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.903]  So I'm gonna go over more of that later.
[01:10:44.903 --> 01:10:51.206]  There's a report here out of the Associated Press, headline, Troops Already Outnumbered Taliban 12 to 1.
[01:10:54.758 --> 01:11:03.625]  There are more than 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan working with 200,000 Afghan security forces and police.
[01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:12.552]  It adds up to 12 to 1 numerical advantage over Taliban rebels, but it hasn't led to anything close to victory.
[01:11:12.552 --> 01:11:15.394]  Because you've got a bunch of different tribes killing each other.
[01:11:16.957 --> 01:11:22.540]  You've got a bunch of different drug-dealing tribes, drug-dealing warlords.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:30.264]  Most of them are controlled by the mayor of Kabul, Mohammed Karzai, the puppet president.
[01:11:30.264 --> 01:11:31.925]  He's really the mayor.
[01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:33.146]  That's all they hold.
[01:11:33.146 --> 01:11:35.107]  And a few other cities.
[01:11:35.107 --> 01:11:44.992]  And they have aircraft that fly over and spray with pesticides the poppy fields that don't launder their money and their drugs through the CIA and the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:46.004 --> 01:11:51.207]  They sell it to the Russians, and they sell it to the Pakistanis, and they sell it to the Chinese.
[01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:56.550]  All the governments and all the secret police are involved in becoming billionaires.
[01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:58.371]  It's very fun!
[01:11:58.371 --> 01:12:13.419]  And they're not going to be billionaires if opium and all its derivatives, like heroin, were decriminalized and said, you poor, pathetic, stupid junkie on opiates, destroying your life.
[01:12:13.419 --> 01:12:15.420]  The minute you decriminalize it,
[01:12:16.879 --> 01:12:24.036]  The junkies stopped robbing your house, your computer, your jewelry, your car, to get the $300 a day habit.
[01:12:26.636 --> 01:12:29.917]  Because now, it's as cheap as cigarettes.
[01:12:29.917 --> 01:12:33.519]  And if they want to go ruin their lives and kill themselves, that's the case.
[01:12:33.519 --> 01:12:35.520]  And Europe has decriminalized.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.320]  And guess what?
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.282]  People stopped using heroin by over 50%.
[01:12:39.282 --> 01:12:41.122]  You can go pull the statistics up.
[01:12:41.122 --> 01:12:52.127]  Because they understand it's dirty, it's stupid, it's big bloody bruises all over you, and tracks in your arteries, in your veins.
[01:12:52.127 --> 01:12:54.228]  It's dirty and disgusting.
[01:12:54.228 --> 01:12:55.829]  But all the crime leaves.
[01:12:56.872 --> 01:13:01.217]  This is a tax to the CIA and the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:01.217 --> 01:13:02.879]  And how do the young women pay for it?
[01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.862]  They go out and they hook their bodies.
[01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:07.525]  They go out and they lay down with five, ten men a day.
[01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:08.766]  They get HIV.
[01:13:08.766 --> 01:13:09.687]  They get hepatitis.
[01:13:09.687 --> 01:13:12.251]  They live in dirty hotel rooms.
[01:13:12.251 --> 01:13:14.694]  So all the money can be pumped back to the bankers.
[01:13:15.194 --> 01:13:20.596]  And so cops can run around running checkpoints feeling real authoritative searching your car.
[01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:23.096]  I don't use your dirty, filthy smack!
[01:13:23.096 --> 01:13:29.078]  I don't use your marijuana, I don't use your methamphetamine, I don't use your cocaine, I don't use any of your crap!
[01:13:29.078 --> 01:13:32.839]  I don't use your Ritalin, your Prozac, your flu shots, any of it!
[01:13:32.839 --> 01:13:33.659]  You got me?
[01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:41.121]  You scum, you filth, you trash that ship this stuff in and push it on our society?
[01:13:41.121 --> 01:13:42.862]  Alright, I meant to just mention the headline.
[01:13:42.862 --> 01:13:43.202]  It's just
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:45.800]  I'll never forget.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.841]  It was about six months ago.
[01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:53.623]  I'm driving in the car home, listening to XM slash Sirius.
[01:13:53.623 --> 01:13:58.405]  I actually have Sirius in my car.
[01:13:58.405 --> 01:13:59.565]  But now it's XM Sirius.
[01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:04.867]  The point is, I'm driving in my car and I listen to a BBC News report, ten minutes long,
[01:14:06.334 --> 01:14:08.955]  And everything is archived now at BBC.com.
[01:14:08.955 --> 01:14:10.235]  I meant to write down the name of it.
[01:14:10.235 --> 01:14:13.976]  I did and then wrote it on a receipt and then forgot to pull it up.
[01:14:13.976 --> 01:14:16.076]  I'm so busy, there's so much news.
[01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:19.577]  But it was a report on opium production.
[01:14:19.577 --> 01:14:22.078]  Somebody should dig that out and put it on YouTube.
[01:14:22.078 --> 01:14:23.378]  I wanted to play clips of it here.
[01:14:23.378 --> 01:14:32.800]  But the point is, here's the New York Times where they just in a paragraph just lightly mention, oh, he's the biggest drug dealer in the country.
[01:14:35.382 --> 01:14:38.063]  And, by the way, he works for the CIA.
[01:14:38.063 --> 01:14:39.763]  Mohammed Karzai's brother.
[01:14:39.763 --> 01:14:41.624]  Of course he does!
[01:14:41.624 --> 01:14:44.744]  But, but... There's that headline.
[01:14:44.744 --> 01:14:45.464]  You can go read that.
[01:14:45.464 --> 01:14:53.286]  Brother of Afghan leader is said to be at CIA payroll.
[01:14:53.286 --> 01:14:55.287]  But I'm driving down the road and I'm listening to the BBC.
[01:14:58.175 --> 01:15:02.017]  And they report massive news like it's no big deal.
[01:15:02.017 --> 01:15:10.461]  Just like mainstream media will go, yeah, a lot of people do get Guillain-Barré or have seizures or die from the vaccine, but it's a good cause to pave.
[01:15:10.461 --> 01:15:13.883]  The benefits outweigh the dangers.
[01:15:13.883 --> 01:15:15.763]  It doesn't.
[01:15:15.763 --> 01:15:19.105]  There are a few newscasts that tell the truth like that.
[01:15:19.105 --> 01:15:20.045]  Or some of the truth.
[01:15:20.045 --> 01:15:20.926]  They admit it can hurt you.
[01:15:22.659 --> 01:15:25.841]  It's the same thing with the whole opium situation.
[01:15:25.841 --> 01:15:28.523]  They admitted it was a $500 billion, and that's raw.
[01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:31.305]  That's coming out of the country, $500 billion.
[01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:33.046]  $500 billion industry a year.
[01:15:33.046 --> 01:15:38.670]  It's secret, like gold, or art, or collectibles.
[01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:42.292]  That's a whole black market currency that the elites traffic in.
[01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:46.575]  So they get to loan it out 8 to 10 times through fractional reserve banking.
[01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:47.736]  So what's 10 times $500 billion?
[01:15:47.736 --> 01:15:48.376]  It's $5 trillion.
[01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:56.434]  Five trillion dollars!
[01:15:56.434 --> 01:15:57.996]  Just out of Afghanistan.
[01:15:57.996 --> 01:16:02.801]  Now, you now understand why the troops are there.
[01:16:02.801 --> 01:16:14.712]  But they just calmly announced and calmly admitted, like they were talking about the price of pork bellies on the Chicago Mercantile that
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:20.101]  The United States has a delicate balancing act fighting the Taliban in Al-Qaeda.
[01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:21.922]  That's how they say it in England.
[01:16:21.922 --> 01:16:23.182]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:16:23.182 --> 01:16:34.386]  They have a delicate balancing act when fighting the Taliban in Al-Qaeda, working with local warlords and chiefs, whose main source of income is opium.
[01:16:34.386 --> 01:16:41.388]  So the US and British forces, German forces, and UNIFOR forces, as well as NATO, are forced to protect the opium.
[01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.429]  They don't like it, but they do it.
[01:16:44.966 --> 01:16:48.248]  And they cut to somebody from the State Department going in the U.S.
[01:16:48.248 --> 01:16:54.173]  Well, yes, we do have to do this, or that would give the Taliban and Al-Qaeda a foothold, and then they would take over.
[01:16:54.173 --> 01:17:00.157]  We've got to work with people, and we don't like it, but jeepers creepers.
[01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.278]  That's why you see U.S.
[01:17:01.278 --> 01:17:04.901]  troops on mountaintops over the opium valleys.
[01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:07.323]  And yes, we do eradicate some.
[01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:08.544]  We do eradicate some.
[01:17:08.544 --> 01:17:12.427]  And they go on to say, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda is opium, so they can't.
[01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:14.048]  Who do you think the warlords are?
[01:17:14.926 --> 01:17:18.568]  Who do you think these people are?
[01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:31.036]  The author of Jawbreaker, the CIA section chief who retired, who we had on a few years ago, he admitted, he said, yes, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda did work for us previously.
[01:17:31.036 --> 01:17:34.418]  Not anymore, of course.
[01:17:34.418 --> 01:17:42.863]  Doesn't matter if the FBI translator, Sybil Edmonds, is now broken her gag ordering on public three months ago and stated on the record,
[01:17:45.678 --> 01:18:03.312]  In court, that the classified information that she told the 9-11 Commission and that she was ordered to not tell the public, was that she was listening to chatter of Al-Qaeda and Taliban taking orders from the CIA on the day of 9-11.
[01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:07.976]  She said they worked for them until the day of 9-11.
[01:18:07.976 --> 01:18:13.740]  Of course they did, and she said it was child kidnapping, money laundering, weapons running.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:14.301]  Of course!
[01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:22.085]  Why does the CIA love Arab extremists and Muslim extremists, especially Wahhabists?
[01:18:22.085 --> 01:18:24.207]  Because they are cult members, folks.
[01:18:24.207 --> 01:18:26.049]  They are nuts.
[01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:40.943]  You can have a high-level CIA operative like bin Laden or his henchmen, and they can give orders to real, psychopathic Muslim extremists who really think they're kidnapping children and bombing buildings and running drugs to fight the Western infidels.
[01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:47.255]  They're organic, mind-control slaves from the Muslim nations!
[01:18:48.496 --> 01:18:51.497]  This is better than any Manchurian candidate.
[01:18:51.497 --> 01:18:54.039]  They have been raised to believe this.
[01:18:54.039 --> 01:18:58.301]  This is in some of their cultures, in some of the minority groups of the cultures.
[01:18:58.301 --> 01:19:02.243]  And they don't know they're working for Israel in the United States.
[01:19:02.243 --> 01:19:05.904]  They don't know they're working for British Intel, though it's been declassified many times.
[01:19:05.904 --> 01:19:11.287]  It was Muslim extremists used to overthrow Mohammed Mosaddegh in 1953 in Iran.
[01:19:11.287 --> 01:19:12.928]  Operation Ajax, that's declassified.
[01:19:14.431 --> 01:19:15.591]  The U.S.
[01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:20.993]  and England went in and funded the Mullahs to overthrow the government.
[01:19:20.993 --> 01:19:25.394]  Because it was a secular mainline government.
[01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.875]  You see, that's what's so sick about this.
[01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:37.258]  Al-Qaeda is Muslim terrorist, they are extremist, and they've got people working for them who don't even know they're working for the U.S.
[01:19:37.258 --> 01:19:38.778]  government!
[01:19:38.778 --> 01:19:40.399]  That is how sick this is!
[01:19:42.469 --> 01:19:50.832]  And the troops are out there guarding the opium going, gee whiz, I guess we do this so the Taliban and Al Qaeda don't get the money.
[01:19:50.832 --> 01:19:54.393]  And then they just admit it like it's no big deal in the New York Times.
[01:19:54.393 --> 01:19:56.894]  Your call is straight ahead in a bunch of other news.
[01:19:56.894 --> 01:19:57.334]  Stay with us.

[01:20:07.248 --> 01:20:08.489]  First, the facts.
[01:20:08.489 --> 01:20:11.472]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.

[01:20:13.654 --> 01:20:15.095]  122 billion for AIG.
[01:20:15.095 --> 01:20:16.737]  More for Fannie and Freddie.
[01:20:16.737 --> 01:20:17.578]  The result?
[01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:18.539]  A deficit of over 1%.
[01:20:18.899 --> 01:20:19.419]  We're good to go.

[01:23:54.555 --> 01:23:57.037]  If you search the news term,
[01:24:19.986 --> 01:24:30.623]  County, city, state, feds to pay for tips on tax cheats, or environment cheats, or child abuse, which means yelling at your child.
[01:24:30.623 --> 01:24:32.166]  It's not illegal to still take your child.
[01:24:33.513 --> 01:24:36.175]  You will see hundreds of new articles a day.
[01:24:36.175 --> 01:24:40.057]  They're just advertising everywhere to tattle and to spy.
[01:24:40.057 --> 01:24:46.161]  Here is the NBC headline out of Chicago, Rats!
[01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:49.082]  City to pay for informing on tax cheats.
[01:24:49.082 --> 01:25:02.691]  Meanwhile, the feds in the last decade have reduced by over 90% the amount of FBI agents, Secret Service, Treasury Department investigators on supposed tax cheats
[01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:07.193]  For people worth more than a million dollars.
[01:25:07.193 --> 01:25:13.397]  And they focus the few tax investigators, and I understand the income taxes of fraud, of the private Federal Reserve.
[01:25:14.551 --> 01:25:18.612]  But if you're going to have it, the point is, it's selectively enforced.
[01:25:18.612 --> 01:25:24.314]  More than half of Congress, the news has reported, is either behind on their taxes or don't pay taxes.
[01:25:24.314 --> 01:25:28.995]  Large portions of the Treasury Department don't pay taxes.
[01:25:28.995 --> 01:25:32.116]  Geithner is a good example of that.
[01:25:32.116 --> 01:25:36.017]  Look at Rangel, owning all these homes he wasn't paying for.
[01:25:36.017 --> 01:25:39.458]  These people do what they want, when they want, how they want.
[01:25:41.195 --> 01:25:46.277]  And then meanwhile they're training the public to spy and tattle on each other.
[01:25:46.277 --> 01:25:49.318]  The reward would amount to some sort of percentage.
[01:25:49.318 --> 01:25:50.839]  Yes.
[01:25:50.839 --> 01:25:53.460]  That is the headline.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:56.061]  You get a percentage of whatever comes in.
[01:25:56.061 --> 01:25:58.301]  So this is our new economy.
[01:25:58.301 --> 01:26:00.962]  Everyone informing and spying and tattling.
[01:26:00.962 --> 01:26:02.103]  And it's not just about money.
[01:26:03.274 --> 01:26:07.217]  The government can monetize the debt and just issue itself whatever amount of money it wants.
[01:26:07.217 --> 01:26:28.454]  This is about dividing people further and not making the public trust each other so that everyone goes into a chilling effect paradigm, shuts up, keeps their mouth shut, doesn't stick their head up above the grass for fear it'll get cut off and society spirals downwards into tyranny.
[01:26:28.454 --> 01:26:31.136]  Chicago and Cook County residents aren't the only ones
[01:26:32.398 --> 01:26:34.360]  About to get shocking tax news.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:41.725]  The city is debuting the tax whistleblower plan that could turn neighbor against neighbor in Chicago's business community.
[01:26:41.725 --> 01:26:48.330]  The folks at City Hall will pay cash bounties to informants who turn in business tax cheats around the city.
[01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:53.314]  The reward would amount to some sort of percentage of the tax money that the city recovers.
[01:26:53.314 --> 01:26:53.935]  And that will be
[01:26:56.727 --> 01:26:58.630]  Another divide-and-conquer strategy.
[01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:04.458]  It's just another way to bring people into compliance, Revenue Department spokesman Ed Walsh told The Sun Times.
[01:27:07.372 --> 01:27:13.075]  One of the few things holding our economy up is that many businesses do cheat on their taxes.
[01:27:13.075 --> 01:27:14.116]  And they'll tell you.
[01:27:14.116 --> 01:27:15.917]  They couldn't operate.
[01:27:15.917 --> 01:27:20.259]  They couldn't keep their doors open if they didn't cheat on some taxes.
[01:27:20.259 --> 01:27:28.864]  I don't cheat on any of the taxes, though most of them are unconstitutional, because we're obviously under an incredible magnifying glass here.
[01:27:28.864 --> 01:27:34.948]  And so, I am able to raise the money through advertising and DVD and book sales and donations to operate.
[01:27:36.423 --> 01:27:38.904]  And your donations and purchases are not tax-exempt.
[01:27:38.904 --> 01:27:48.208]  I pay the stinkers, you know, 35% tax brackets when I'm in.
[01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:56.871]  Though I do try to spend most of the money that comes in on the business, on the operation, so a lot of it doesn't end up getting paid in taxes because we can write most of it off.
[01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.952]  But still, my employees all pay taxes.
[01:28:00.131 --> 01:28:01.872]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:28:01.872 --> 01:28:03.273]  Because I have to choose my battles.
[01:28:03.273 --> 01:28:09.157]  I sit here and expose the private Federal Reserve and their 1913 income tax that didn't become widespread until 1951.
[01:28:09.157 --> 01:28:15.322]  And I point out how our country was built without it, and how all of it's paid for interest on the debt to foreign banks.
[01:28:15.322 --> 01:28:19.344]  Ronald Reagan's own 1981 Congressional Commission found that.
[01:28:19.344 --> 01:28:23.647]  And so I sit here and point out it's criminal and wrong and bad, but I choose my battles.
[01:28:23.647 --> 01:28:28.151]  Because I can't end up going to prison or going to court and fighting some three-, four-year tax case.
[01:28:29.323 --> 01:28:33.791]  But I happen to know that the average business cheats on taxes.
[01:28:34.966 --> 01:28:39.627]  And I know a lot of people that have gone to prison for not paying taxes.
[01:28:39.627 --> 01:28:48.289]  And they're normally blue-collar or lower-middle-class people, and they get the book thrown at them for $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 a year of taxes they didn't pay.
[01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:52.350]  And you find out what their yearly income is.
[01:28:52.350 --> 01:29:01.733]  Some of the business people I know who've been indicted, who've plea bargained, who've gone to prison for six months a year, federally or to the state, these are people that were making $50,000, $60,000 a year at the end of the year.
[01:29:04.352 --> 01:29:08.434]  If they wouldn't have cheated on their taxes, they wouldn't even have made that!
[01:29:08.434 --> 01:29:15.679]  You own a business, you got 10-15 employees, they pay taxes, you cheat here and there so you can have a little bit of money for yourself?
[01:29:15.679 --> 01:29:16.659]  They don't want that!
[01:29:16.659 --> 01:29:18.260]  They want you out of business!
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.181]  They want you bankrupt!
[01:29:20.181 --> 01:29:22.823]  And as they destroy the black market underground economy,
[01:29:26.966 --> 01:29:36.372]  More and more people will go on to welfare and go on to the rolls, and we will become an on-the-dole, dependent society, which is the goal of the eugenicist.
[01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:38.253]  They want you under their control.
[01:29:38.253 --> 01:29:38.634]  Period.
[01:29:38.634 --> 01:29:40.195]  We'll come back with more of a news blitz.
[01:29:40.195 --> 01:29:43.056]  I'm gonna hurry up a bit and go through a bunch of the headlines.
[01:29:43.056 --> 01:29:45.798]  Then we're going to go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:45.798 --> 01:29:51.542]  Mark in Alabama, Angel, Rebel, Jack, and others.
[01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:52.923]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.923 --> 01:29:54.444]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.447 --> 01:30:01.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:05.812]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.812 --> 01:30:09.054]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.054 --> 01:30:13.856]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:13.856 --> 01:30:20.260]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.481]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.021 --> 01:30:23.321]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.321 --> 01:30:23.841]  Bernanke?
[01:30:23.841 --> 01:30:24.642]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.642 --> 01:30:25.802]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.802 --> 01:30:28.043]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:41.929 --> 01:30:49.196]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.196 --> 01:30:58.324]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:01.018 --> 01:31:04.039]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.039 --> 01:31:09.362]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.362 --> 01:31:11.403]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.403 --> 01:31:16.405]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.405 --> 01:31:17.605]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:18.726]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.726 --> 01:31:20.607]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.607 --> 01:31:21.687]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.687 --> 01:31:23.688]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.868 --> 01:31:25.210]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.210 --> 01:31:26.731]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:32.018]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.018 --> 01:31:35.602]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.602 --> 01:31:39.066]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.406 --> 01:31:40.628]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:41.549]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.549 --> 01:31:42.650]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:43.571]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.571 --> 01:31:44.672]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.672 --> 01:31:47.716]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.716 --> 01:31:49.498]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.498 --> 01:31:50.419]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:09.998]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablu, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[01:32:09.998 --> 01:32:11.599]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:32:11.599 --> 01:32:12.679]  It's very real.
[01:32:12.679 --> 01:32:13.039]  I know.
[01:32:13.039 --> 01:32:17.261]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:20.482]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.482 --> 01:32:23.523]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence.
[01:32:23.803 --> 01:32:29.127]  By ordering or own a Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:35.831]  Their best seller, the Acola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:35.831 --> 01:32:39.894]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system.
[01:32:40.214 --> 01:32:44.518]  Including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:44.518 --> 01:32:49.241]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.241 --> 01:32:49.462]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.462 --> 01:32:51.603]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at ecoloble.com today.
[01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:25.729]  Think about the hypocrisy, think about the corruption of foreign offshore banks that have purposely bankrupt hundreds of third world nations so they could control them.
[01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:36.037]  It's in the IMF and World Bank policy reports, it's in documents leaked in 2002, covered by the BBC, how they do all of this by design and they're now doing
[01:33:38.342 --> 01:33:42.144]  The same thing to the United States and Europe and Japan.
[01:33:42.144 --> 01:33:43.524]  And they want you bankrupt.
[01:33:43.524 --> 01:33:44.925]  They want you poor.
[01:33:44.925 --> 01:33:50.927]  They want to raise taxes to a point where you can't afford to work for yourself.
[01:33:50.927 --> 01:33:59.431]  You can only work for the big mega-corporations who write all the tax loopholes and rules to where they don't have to basically pay any taxes.
[01:33:59.431 --> 01:34:02.232]  And then they're caught even cheating on those and not paying them.
[01:34:04.537 --> 01:34:08.098]  They have incentives to move their businesses offshore.
[01:34:08.098 --> 01:34:10.878]  They're based in offshore corporations.
[01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:28.162]  And the IMF and the World Bank and the OECD and all these international private consortiums were created and founded and run by the very same financial institutions that are now writing the tax rules where you can't hide two pennies to rub together.
[01:34:29.631 --> 01:34:39.878]  The banks have written the tax rules to rob you, and then government gives them your money.
[01:34:39.878 --> 01:34:45.642]  And I know the listeners are aware of this, but it gives me a headache to think about it.
[01:34:45.642 --> 01:34:49.585]  It makes my head spin.
[01:34:49.585 --> 01:34:57.911]  To realize that it's only going to intensify, and the dumbed-down public has no idea
[01:34:59.346 --> 01:35:14.888]  What's happening to them and the corrupt so-called government publicly protects the poppy fields and helps ship the heroin out of the nation of Afghanistan
[01:35:15.993 --> 01:35:44.264]  and that's why the troops are there and that's why the pentagon sends out predator drones and reapers to bomb and kill weddings and to kill villagers so that the tribal villagers who believe in an eye for an eye will strike back so the illusion of a war can continue so that US forces and UN forces over two hundred
[01:35:46.067 --> 01:35:56.456]  100,000 Afghan security forces, 100,000 international troops, 300,000 total, can stay there in the country to sit on top those opium fields.
[01:35:56.456 --> 01:36:01.260]  And that's just one business of the New World Order.
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.341]  One of their businesses.
[01:36:02.341 --> 01:36:04.143]  Their businesses are all death.
[01:36:04.143 --> 01:36:10.629]  Heroin, cocaine, Ritalin, Prozac, cancer-laced, mercury-laced vaccines.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:15.001]  CPS kidnapping everybody's children.
[01:36:15.001 --> 01:36:18.282]  Environmental groups stealing people's private property.
[01:36:18.282 --> 01:36:23.643]  The feds harassing farms and ranches under animal ID and premises ID.
[01:36:23.643 --> 01:36:31.985]  Always more money, always more funds for police and bureaucrats and control freaks as society goes to hell in a handbasket.
[01:36:37.782 --> 01:36:42.668]  New York Times, Afghan opium kingpin on CIA payroll.
[01:36:42.668 --> 01:36:50.857]  Just so unbelievable.
[01:36:50.857 --> 01:36:57.304]  And then meanwhile, as many as 39,000 homeless people are checking into New York City shelters each night.
[01:36:57.304 --> 01:36:58.986]  I saw a news report last week
[01:37:02.532 --> 01:37:13.199]  That in Detroit they have a government welfare program, a new government welfare program that had 3,200 slots offered and 55,000 people showed up wanting it.
[01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:18.162]  And I sent Aaron Dykes and Rob Due to Detroit as well as Canada and D.C.
[01:37:18.162 --> 01:37:20.304]  for interviews for Fall of the Republic 2 we're working on.
[01:37:21.457 --> 01:37:26.698]  And I talked to them on the phone and they said it's worse than what the news has reported.
[01:37:26.698 --> 01:37:41.462]  You can drive for mile after mile and look at collapsing neighborhoods overgrown with vines, gangs of criminals running around, police everywhere riding the few slaves tickets as anyone who can leave exits.
[01:37:42.302 --> 01:37:47.385]  And as the bureaucrats try to raise taxes on the dwindling tax base.
[01:37:47.385 --> 01:37:49.045]  That is the New World Order.
[01:37:49.045 --> 01:37:50.786]  That is globalization.
[01:37:50.786 --> 01:37:56.069]  That is NAFTA and GATT.
[01:37:56.069 --> 01:37:56.609]  And they love it.
[01:37:56.609 --> 01:37:58.310]  The bureaucrats love everything collapsing.
[01:37:58.310 --> 01:38:10.496]  They love just sitting on top of a slag heap of a collapsing society as Michigan fades into some type of science fiction dystopic
[01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:17.272]  Mirage.
[01:38:17.272 --> 01:38:19.133]  D.C.
[01:38:19.133 --> 01:38:21.354]  is falling into rack and ruin.
[01:38:21.354 --> 01:38:26.516]  Los Angeles is falling into crime and cess.
[01:38:26.516 --> 01:38:36.920]  The country's overrun with hordes of desperate third world people driving down the wages, bankrupting state agencies.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.141]  And the government is growing.
[01:38:39.195 --> 01:38:39.796]  We're good to go.
[01:38:56.175 --> 01:39:02.938]  The federal government comes in and lobbies the state of Texas and other states to pass laws saying no more Fourth Amendment.
[01:39:02.938 --> 01:39:09.421]  We're going to take your blood at warrantless checkpoints and police are going to be taking it.
[01:39:09.421 --> 01:39:16.845]  When a nurse of 20 years can still take five minutes to find a vein on somebody's arm.
[01:39:21.405 --> 01:39:32.247]  Warrantless DNA databases for 36, going on 37 years, a secret UN program in every industrialized nation.
[01:39:32.247 --> 01:39:36.248]  Took blood from babies at birth and put it in a UN database.
[01:39:36.248 --> 01:39:40.449]  Over a decade ago, I got the classified documents.
[01:39:40.449 --> 01:39:42.749]  I had members of the US Congress on about it.
[01:39:42.749 --> 01:39:46.230]  I had lawmakers from Australia on discussing it.
[01:39:48.359 --> 01:39:51.862]  How the police were using it for an illegal DNA database?
[01:39:51.862 --> 01:39:52.903]  People laughed at me.
[01:39:52.903 --> 01:39:54.765]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:39:54.765 --> 01:39:58.929]  Ladies and gentlemen, the entire government needs to be abolished.
[01:39:58.929 --> 01:40:02.533]  It needs to be cut in size by 95%.
[01:40:02.533 --> 01:40:07.658]  Tens of thousands of corrupt bureaucrats and bankers must be arrested for the crimes they've committed.
[01:40:10.649 --> 01:40:19.974]  Ron Paul has told you, the Treasury Department, the Private Fellow Reserve, they could all be indicted for scores of felonies for what they've done with the banking system.
[01:40:19.974 --> 01:40:32.360]  Even though they wrote the laws where they could commit most of the crimes, they went further than even their own loopholes!
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.783]  We've got to come to grips with the fact that they're playing us off against each other, dividing and conquering.
[01:40:39.352 --> 01:41:00.113]  And that it is thoroughly and completely corrupt and out of control and the bureaucrats are taking people's passive, lethargic, zombie-like attitude as a big, fat, flashing green light to press their foot on the accelerator.
[01:41:07.156 --> 01:41:09.901]  And so, history is a roadmap for us.
[01:41:09.901 --> 01:41:15.651]  It proves that it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse
[01:41:20.797 --> 01:41:23.540]  Intensifying the insanity.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:25.682]  Forced inoculations.
[01:41:25.682 --> 01:41:27.364]  Mass arrest.
[01:41:27.364 --> 01:41:29.306]  No First Amendment.
[01:41:29.306 --> 01:41:30.968]  Shutting down and taking over the internet.
[01:41:30.968 --> 01:41:33.311]  They're now announcing different ways they plan to do it.
[01:41:33.311 --> 01:41:35.013]  Taxing everything.
[01:41:35.013 --> 01:41:37.876]  Raising your children in government dormitories.
[01:41:37.876 --> 01:41:42.541]  It's all being announced and phased in right now.
[01:41:51.485 --> 01:41:58.107]  And those of you that still work and still pay your bills and still make it through this system, you are the targets.
[01:41:58.107 --> 01:42:01.248]  And once you're bankrupted, it'll be full government control.
[01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.048]  They control the means of production.
[01:42:03.048 --> 01:42:07.449]  The big corporations are teamed up with them.
[01:42:07.449 --> 01:42:09.470]  And that's when the real tyranny begins.
[01:42:17.406 --> 01:42:41.771]  And the entire Pentagon future purchasing structure is going completely to robotic ground armies, robotic ground tanks, combat droids, drones, artificially intelligent bombers, fighter bombers, hunter-killers, bullets that can go around corners that have hunter-seeker missiles in them.
[01:42:41.771 --> 01:42:44.452]  The bullet itself is a hunter-seeker missile.
[01:42:44.452 --> 01:42:45.932]  Just massive
[01:42:46.912 --> 01:42:51.014]  Build up of high-tech weaponry against the average person.
[01:42:51.014 --> 01:42:54.436]  Meanwhile, the government wants your .357 pop gun.
[01:42:54.436 --> 01:42:55.797]  They want your deer rifle.
[01:42:55.797 --> 01:42:57.478]  They're scared to death of that.
[01:42:57.478 --> 01:43:02.461]  While they take your tax money and build up massive weapon systems against you.
[01:43:03.641 --> 01:43:15.349]  And every new computer and cell phone and system is designed under federal law to regulate, track, trace, tax, and control and illegally surveil everything you're doing.
[01:43:15.349 --> 01:43:25.416]  And Barack Obama is taking the entire agenda that Bush was continuing.
[01:43:25.416 --> 01:43:27.618]  And he is put into overdrive.
[01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:31.761]  No difference except in skin color and rhetoric.
[01:43:31.761 --> 01:43:32.762]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:43:35.441 --> 01:43:39.543]  The magnitude of this just continues to hit me every day.
[01:43:39.543 --> 01:43:41.284]  I know why a lot of you are in denial.
[01:43:41.284 --> 01:43:47.506]  I know why a lot of you say it can't be true, or I exaggerate, or I'm a fear monger.
[01:43:47.506 --> 01:43:49.047]  I don't blame you.
[01:43:49.047 --> 01:43:53.229]  Because it's hard for me to believe what's happening, and I know it's real.
[01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:55.269]  And I don't want to believe it.
[01:43:55.269 --> 01:44:03.253]  And to face this, and to admit to yourself it's real, and to admit to yourself that we are in a scientifically crafted dictatorship
[01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:14.649]  That brags that it's studied all the dictatorships of the past and it's trying to hone and create the ultimate tyranny.
[01:44:14.649 --> 01:44:22.856]  And that it's so organized and evil.
[01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.178]  We got our work cut out for us.
[01:44:24.178 --> 01:44:26.280]  The good news is people are waking up.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.601]  But let me tell you, not fast enough.
[01:44:28.641 --> 01:44:31.302]  You are being poisoned in your water supply.
[01:44:31.302 --> 01:44:33.423]  You are being sprayed with chemtrails.
[01:44:33.423 --> 01:44:36.665]  You are being poisoned with the vaccines.
[01:44:36.665 --> 01:44:42.647]  We do have a group of psychopathic killers running the power structure, and they think it's funny!
[01:44:42.647 --> 01:44:50.111]  They think it's funny they can buy some slick young newscaster who'll go up there and read off a teleprompter and lie to everybody for petty status.
[01:44:50.111 --> 01:44:54.153]  They love it they can hire young people to be aggressive, brute police who will
[01:44:55.162 --> 01:44:59.843]  Beat people hat to death for protesting with pleasure.
[01:44:59.843 --> 01:45:09.507]  They love it they can hire plenty of cops and military that will go out and stage provocateur attacks on themselves so they can attack the peaceful protesters.
[01:45:09.507 --> 01:45:11.007]  They love it!
[01:45:11.007 --> 01:45:14.788]  They love it!
[01:45:14.788 --> 01:45:18.529]  And so you better study history ladies and gentlemen and find out what governments do.
[01:45:18.529 --> 01:45:22.971]  The last government to truly carry out the globalist plan was the Maoist China.
[01:45:24.684 --> 01:45:27.245]  And the Chinese government says they killed 80 plus million people.
[01:45:27.245 --> 01:45:27.905]  Our government says 64.
[01:45:27.905 --> 01:45:38.789]  Depending on the number you look at, 60, 62, 65, 68, 64 is what Wikipedia says.
[01:45:38.789 --> 01:45:43.950]  Killing is their business and business is good.
[01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:45.451]  As the Dave Mustaine line goes.
[01:45:52.682 --> 01:45:59.045]  And we need to step back and really soak in and really let it hit our bone.
[01:45:59.045 --> 01:46:02.087]  Just how big this is and just how real this is.
[01:46:02.087 --> 01:46:06.549]  And then ask yourselves, how in the world do you not care about these issues?
[01:46:06.549 --> 01:46:11.292]  Why are you driving in your car right now laughing about this?
[01:46:11.292 --> 01:46:12.953]  Some of you out there.
[01:46:12.953 --> 01:46:17.115]  Because I'll assure you it's not funny.
[01:46:17.115 --> 01:46:18.696]  Virgil, have we ever talked to Virgil?
[01:46:20.976 --> 01:46:21.737]  Mark.
[01:46:21.737 --> 01:46:23.918]  Mark in Alabama, you're on the air.
[01:46:23.918 --> 01:46:26.240]  Hey, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.040]  I got a headache.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:30.542]  I mean, just coming in here and thinking about this gave me a headache.
[01:46:30.542 --> 01:46:31.623]  Take a deep breath, brother.
[01:46:31.623 --> 01:46:49.035]  Listen, in Guntersville, Alabama, I'm helping to awaken the Eloy by getting your videos in the local libraries and, believe it or not, on the shelf at the local Blockbuster, and they'll actually give you
[01:46:49.835 --> 01:47:01.059]  A seven or eight dollar credit to your account if you donate a new unopened Alex Jones documentary like Endgame or Terror Storm.
[01:47:01.059 --> 01:47:04.960]  I even got Freedom to Fascism on the shelf and they're all three still there.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.241]  People read them.
[01:47:08.241 --> 01:47:12.563]  And so, I mean, is this a big chain or just a local shop?
[01:47:12.563 --> 01:47:15.504]  Blockbuster?
[01:47:15.504 --> 01:47:16.264]  Yeah, a big chain.
[01:47:17.017 --> 01:47:21.879]  Is that the private franchise owner doing that, or are the chains allowing that?
[01:47:21.879 --> 01:47:27.460]  The store manager makes a phone call and finds out if she can put it on the shelf.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:32.942]  Apparently she's calling her boss at the regional place, so I assume that, yeah.
[01:47:32.942 --> 01:47:35.283]  Yeah, but it works.
[01:47:37.810 --> 01:47:39.211]  That is exciting.
[01:47:39.211 --> 01:47:52.137]  What do you think about the state of the world and all these announcements in big newspapers like the New York Times that yes, the carbon tax is the key to world government and they're going to put taxes on our dogs because they eat meat.
[01:47:52.137 --> 01:47:54.519]  They're going to inspect our homes.
[01:47:54.519 --> 01:47:56.500]  It's just hellish.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:04.404]  Alex, I got a two-word answer to that question and that is boycott Babylon.
[01:48:06.792 --> 01:48:09.533]  Oh, that's a great term.
[01:48:09.533 --> 01:48:11.074]  You have a good one, Alex.
[01:48:11.074 --> 01:48:12.194]  Yes.
[01:48:12.194 --> 01:48:13.315]  Take care.
[01:48:13.315 --> 01:48:14.315]  Take care, my friend.
[01:48:14.315 --> 01:48:16.316]  Boycott Babylon.
[01:48:16.316 --> 01:48:18.817]  What a great term.
[01:48:18.817 --> 01:48:20.238]  Thank you, Mark.
[01:48:20.238 --> 01:48:22.039]  Angel.
[01:48:22.039 --> 01:48:23.199]  Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:23.559]  Go ahead.
[01:48:23.559 --> 01:48:25.500]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:26.621]  God bless you.
[01:48:26.621 --> 01:48:27.781]  Really, God bless you.
[01:48:27.781 --> 01:48:31.443]  I am in my own fight here.
[01:48:31.443 --> 01:48:35.405]  I have been very passionate in telling people my story and
[01:48:37.193 --> 01:48:41.096]  I am a mother of three poisoned children.
[01:48:41.096 --> 01:48:45.859]  They have autism, allergies, asthma.
[01:48:45.859 --> 01:48:47.601]  They have been vaccinated.
[01:48:47.601 --> 01:48:59.429]  I trusted the doctors and the nurses that told me that it wasn't going to hurt them, it wasn't going to give them autism.
[01:48:59.429 --> 01:49:04.033]  I think I have been guided by God to find out what exactly happened.
[01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:17.364]  The hyperactivity, the repetition, the... You know, one of my boys, he bounces on the balls of his feet and flaps his hands.
[01:49:17.364 --> 01:49:19.925]  It's brain damage.
[01:49:19.925 --> 01:49:20.726]  What's that?
[01:49:20.726 --> 01:49:24.528]  It's brain damage from the mercury and the adjuvants.
[01:49:24.528 --> 01:49:25.648]  Yep, and it goes farther than that.
[01:49:25.648 --> 01:49:35.434]  You need to keep him off all MSG, lots of fish oil, according to medical doctors we've had on, I'm sure you already know all this, off of all processed sugar and off of television.
[01:49:36.681 --> 01:49:38.842]  But it goes farther than that.
[01:49:38.842 --> 01:49:51.371]  To unravel it, it's not just brain damage, it's something that can actually be reversed, and most of it... No, I know it can be reversed, because the brain, especially when they're young, can rewire itself.
[01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:53.232]  Well, it's yeast overgrowth.
[01:49:53.232 --> 01:49:59.617]  See, when they get the vaccines and the antibiotics, it kills the good bacteria in the intestines.
[01:49:59.617 --> 01:50:04.060]  And then toxins start secreting there, and then medical doctors have said that as well, yes.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:13.466]  Well, because it kills the good bacteria in the intestines, then there's room for the yeast that is in small quantities to overgrow.
[01:50:13.466 --> 01:50:27.655]  And then when that yeast overgrowth happens, it actually becomes to a point where it actually grows roots, and then it perforates the walls of the intestines, and then there's holes there in the intestines.
[01:50:27.655 --> 01:50:29.817]  And then you give them the wrong foods.
[01:50:29.817 --> 01:50:33.640]  You give them gluten, foods that have gluten, and milk.
[01:50:34.949 --> 01:50:37.671]  And those proteins go through there, right?
[01:50:37.671 --> 01:50:39.493]  And then there's those holes in the intestines.
[01:50:39.493 --> 01:50:47.460]  They leak through those holes in the intestines, and they attach to the opiate receptors in the brain, just like heroin, okay?
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:53.205]  So autistic children are essentially heroin addicts.
[01:50:53.205 --> 01:50:58.070]  You know, I've seen some similar information from some research studies, but not that precisely.
[01:51:01.158 --> 01:51:08.900]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:17.482]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[01:51:17.482 --> 01:51:22.244]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:51:22.244 --> 01:51:26.165]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[01:51:26.165 --> 01:51:30.306]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[01:51:30.586 --> 01:51:31.166]  We're good.
[01:52:02.387 --> 01:52:06.430]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:09.653]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.653 --> 01:52:11.054]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:11.767 --> 01:52:14.469]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.469 --> 01:52:20.835]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.835 --> 01:52:26.039]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:36.027]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:36.127 --> 01:52:38.469]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.469 --> 01:52:40.070]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:42.531]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.531 --> 01:52:44.653]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.653 --> 01:52:49.796]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:58.922]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:01.058 --> 01:53:02.258]  The once mighty U.S.
[01:53:02.258 --> 01:53:05.280]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.961]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[01:53:07.961 --> 01:53:11.142]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[01:53:11.142 --> 01:53:15.423]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[01:53:15.423 --> 01:53:23.527]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[01:53:23.527 --> 01:53:24.247]  Prepare now!
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.040]  I think so.
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:13.255]  Yeah, mainline medical doctors just aren't trained.
[01:54:13.255 --> 01:54:22.463]  They're not specialists, and they won't tell autistic parents that there are ways to reverse a lot of the toxicity from diets and other things.
[01:54:22.463 --> 01:54:23.804]  But more and more, it's
[01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:30.143]  Becoming common knowledge that there is a lot of that you can reverse.
[01:54:30.143 --> 01:54:32.264]  So thanks for the information, Angel.
[01:54:32.264 --> 01:54:36.546]  We're going to go to more calls coming up here in the next segment.
[01:54:37.639 --> 01:54:44.325]  You know, I let folks make up whatever name they want when they call in, but when they get too long, it does become a problem.
[01:54:44.325 --> 01:54:47.368]  Like, Concerned But Thankful from Michigan.
[01:54:47.368 --> 01:54:49.009]  We're going to take that call.
[01:54:49.009 --> 01:54:56.015]  Rebel Jack and Nancy and others, and a ton of financial news and things I haven't even gotten to yet today, and we have several guests coming up as well.
[01:54:56.856 --> 01:55:01.500]  But before I do that, I do want to encourage listeners to not procrastinate.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:07.645]  I have made a film that is my best work yet, and it really does identify the problem and has the solutions.
[01:55:07.645 --> 01:55:09.046]  It exposes the globalists.
[01:55:09.046 --> 01:55:13.871]  The general public is awakening right now, but they're only awakening to the fact that they've been lied to.
[01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:24.941]  They are not awakening to specifically just how serious it is, and who our adversary, who our enemy is, and what their master plan is.
[01:55:24.941 --> 01:55:30.364]  So I have produced Follow the Republic, available at InfoWars.com, or you can call toll free to get it, 888-253-3139.
[01:55:30.364 --> 01:55:32.385]  Please put it on AXS TV in your area.
[01:55:32.385 --> 01:55:32.625]  Please.
[01:55:38.328 --> 01:55:40.509]  Make copies of it and give it to everyone you know.
[01:55:40.509 --> 01:55:48.835]  Please share the video links with everyone from PrisonPlanet.tv where you can get it online in high quality.
[01:55:48.835 --> 01:55:50.856]  Please get this out to everyone.
[01:55:50.856 --> 01:55:56.700]  This is also an exercise in grassroots action and I think this is the best tool out there bar none.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.101]  The best tool ever created.
[01:55:59.399 --> 01:56:28.290]  To expose these people and the most up-to-date fall the republic.com to order online or info wars.com or call 888-253-3139 I want to go out to break at the end of this hour as we start the third hour With the last few minutes from fall of the Republic The Republic is hanging by a thread the last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away and
[01:56:29.602 --> 01:56:31.583]  You know, you've got time to watch baseball.
[01:56:31.583 --> 01:56:33.064]  You've got time to watch football.
[01:56:33.064 --> 01:56:35.485]  You've got time to entertain yourself.
[01:56:35.485 --> 01:56:40.127]  But I think a knowledgeable public we're losing.
[01:56:40.127 --> 01:56:43.669]  And we've got to get people back on track to paying attention.
[01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:50.892]  Because if you don't pay attention to your government and what they're doing, you're going to pay some dire consequences for it.
[01:56:51.423 --> 01:56:59.086]  Unless we become active and become influential in the power centers of society, there's nothing we can do about it.
[01:56:59.086 --> 01:57:01.246]  Just knowing about it is not enough.
[01:57:01.246 --> 01:57:17.312]  And as long as we are given at election time an option between the Republican candidate or the Democrat candidate, both of whom have been selected by members of the Council on Foreign Relations, and both of whom have the same general policies, that's not going to change anything either.
[01:57:18.152 --> 01:57:21.836]  So, the real issue is, so what?
[01:57:21.836 --> 01:57:26.802]  And the answer is, we've got to recapture control of the power centers of society.
[01:57:26.802 --> 01:57:29.625]  The people have a decision to make.
[01:57:29.625 --> 01:57:34.190]  Our nation has been seized in the jaws of a global corporate takeover.
[01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:37.193]  The Republic is passing into history.
[01:57:37.193 --> 01:57:38.255]  We're losing our freedoms.
[01:57:39.488 --> 01:57:51.476]  And it's up to every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers or whether we're going to restore the republic.
[01:57:51.476 --> 01:57:59.222]  The values expressed by our founding fathers and the Declaration of Independence and other documents are very important to these times and it's now
[01:58:01.031 --> 01:58:05.272]  Our chance to manifest those documents.
[01:58:05.272 --> 01:58:09.673]  Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
[01:58:09.673 --> 01:58:12.973]  Because the country is being stolen from us in broad daylight.
[01:58:12.973 --> 01:58:17.394]  Not only stolen metaphorically, but financially as well.
[01:58:17.394 --> 01:58:19.635]  The numbers don't lie.
[01:58:19.635 --> 01:58:26.976]  The American people, having been educated as to the truth, then have to rise up
[01:58:28.428 --> 01:58:34.832]  And demand and get a government that starts serving them.
[01:58:34.832 --> 01:58:43.156]  We need a change and it isn't going to come from Democrats and Republicans.
[01:58:43.156 --> 01:58:45.658]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.632 --> 01:58:55.938]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:55.938 --> 01:59:00.483]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.483 --> 01:59:02.746]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.746 --> 01:59:04.368]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.368 --> 01:59:05.429]  There is a solution.
[01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:14.052]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:59:53.718 --> 01:59:56.100]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.823]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:10.325]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.325 --> 02:00:11.907]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.907 --> 02:00:12.849]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.849 --> 02:00:17.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.656 --> 02:00:21.721]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.479 --> 02:00:38.844]  We're going to be going live, simulcasting with the live radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV and Living Color when this radio show transforms into a radio-slash-TV hybrid at PrisonPlanet.TV at the 8 After.
[02:00:38.844 --> 02:00:40.905]  Darryl Rundas is going to be joining us.
[02:00:40.905 --> 02:00:43.907]  He was on with us for 30 minutes last week on a host of issues.
[02:00:43.907 --> 02:00:46.208]  We'll have open phones as well in the last hour.
[02:00:47.148 --> 02:00:49.490]  Helmer von Campy.
[02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:54.994]  He was a former Hitlerjugend and when Hitler came to power he then served in the German army.
[02:00:54.994 --> 02:01:02.960]  We'll talk about parallels between our society today and what he saw growing up in Nazi Germany.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:07.463]  Let's talk to Concerned but Thankful, that's their name, from Michigan.
[02:01:07.463 --> 02:01:09.004]  You're on the air.
[02:01:09.004 --> 02:01:14.308]  Alex, this is, hey, I just really want to thank you for making it possible to listen by telephone.
[02:01:14.308 --> 02:01:15.369]  That's how I listen to you.
[02:01:16.110 --> 02:01:19.352]  And especially that you've got a backup number.
[02:01:19.352 --> 02:01:26.315]  And, you know, the last caller that said boycott Babylon, you know, what can we do as a small people?
[02:01:26.315 --> 02:01:31.398]  I say don't participate in the government handouts, the welfare.
[02:01:31.398 --> 02:01:33.799]  I mean, how did they control the North American Indians?
[02:01:34.451 --> 02:01:39.313]  First, they give them everything they want so that all they have time to do is sit around and be drunk.
[02:01:39.313 --> 02:01:41.755]  I mean, I'm not against North American Indians.
[02:01:41.755 --> 02:01:45.837]  They're great people, but they're controlled.
[02:01:45.837 --> 02:01:51.820]  There were manuals on how to give them smallpox blankets, how to give them whiskey, then have them sign contracts.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:59.524]  Oh, then we've got a reservation for you, and there's going to be a reservation agent, and then he's going to control you and cheat you.
[02:01:59.524 --> 02:02:01.905]  And once they had the leaders bought off, they had them.
[02:02:02.694 --> 02:02:03.554]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:03.554 --> 02:02:07.275]  And, you know, we really need to be out there self-supported.
[02:02:07.275 --> 02:02:11.017]  And listen to Alex Jones on the phone, if that's the only way you can do it.
[02:02:11.017 --> 02:02:13.537]  I mean, you're loaded with information.
[02:02:13.537 --> 02:02:15.278]  And, you know, I talk to people all the time.
[02:02:15.278 --> 02:02:19.379]  They put up their hands and say, well, shoot, it's just, you know, it's prophesied.
[02:02:19.379 --> 02:02:21.020]  You know, there ain't nothing we can do about it.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:22.580]  I'm just going to live by faith.
[02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:23.901]  Well, yeah, live by faith.
[02:02:23.901 --> 02:02:25.501]  Don't take the government handouts.
[02:02:25.501 --> 02:02:27.062]  Don't take their shots.
[02:02:27.062 --> 02:02:28.202]  Grow your own garden.
[02:02:29.227 --> 02:02:38.135]  And they know that more and more people are doing that so they're rushing in to bankrupt everything by design in their own words to make us be dependent on them.
[02:02:38.135 --> 02:02:42.939]  They want to make us be dependent on them so they can control our lives.
[02:02:42.939 --> 02:02:43.920]  Exactly.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:47.043]  And get active in your church and your local community.
[02:02:47.043 --> 02:02:51.246]  Be the people people have to look to so they don't have to look to the government.
[02:02:51.246 --> 02:02:53.108]  I see cars going by all day.
[02:02:53.593 --> 02:02:59.474]  On my road here, and it is unbelievable the amount of state cars that pull into my driveway.
[02:02:59.474 --> 02:03:02.535]  I just had a state car in here this morning asking for directions.
[02:03:02.535 --> 02:03:04.836]  I said, well now that's pretty cool.
[02:03:04.836 --> 02:03:07.976]  Here we have a state employee that can't even find her way down the road.
[02:03:07.976 --> 02:03:10.777]  I said, boy, ain't that just a typical example of what we got.
[02:03:10.777 --> 02:03:15.418]  And that's all that's left is government, and they're just sucking and sucking and sucking.
[02:03:15.418 --> 02:03:17.098]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:17.098 --> 02:03:18.799]  Let's talk to Rebel in Canada.
[02:03:18.799 --> 02:03:19.779]  You're on the air, Rebel.
[02:03:21.192 --> 02:03:25.955]  Hi Alex, I love everything you do and I appreciate your passion.
[02:03:25.955 --> 02:03:30.278]  A lot of people think it's, you know, your anger, but I think it's your very passionate, man.
[02:03:30.278 --> 02:03:32.019]  Anyway... Well, we should be angry.
[02:03:32.019 --> 02:03:33.921]  I mean, we should be angry.
[02:03:33.921 --> 02:03:36.502]  Yes, yes, I understand.
[02:03:36.502 --> 02:03:44.348]  The reason I'm calling is I just want to give you a heads up on one of the scenarios of how the government
[02:03:45.223 --> 02:03:50.365]  are going to round up all the opposition that includes people like you are and people like Ron Paul.
[02:03:50.365 --> 02:03:53.247]  And I believe they've already been testing it.
[02:03:53.247 --> 02:03:59.170]  I myself am an immigrant and I'm calling from one of the post-Soviet Union republics, a country called Turkmenistan.
[02:03:59.170 --> 02:04:00.850]  Yes, folks, this country exists.
[02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:03.011]  Google it up.
[02:04:03.011 --> 02:04:09.434]  And the thing I'm going to talk about happened in, I think it was 2002, in November.
[02:04:09.434 --> 02:04:14.777]  The current president of that time, Turkmenbashi, one of the worst dictatorships at that time,
[02:04:15.677 --> 02:04:16.998]  We're good to go.
[02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:40.025]  Stay there!
[02:04:40.025 --> 02:04:44.788]  I'm going to come back to you and then Daryl Rundis because that is exactly what Saddam Hussein did.
[02:04:44.788 --> 02:04:50.112]  Hitler would stage coups to round up his enemies early on.
[02:04:50.112 --> 02:04:54.575]  This is done over and over again and the media keeps saying there's going to be a military coup.
[02:04:54.575 --> 02:04:58.517]  They could stage one as their pretext for NORTHCOM to take over.
[02:04:58.517 --> 02:04:59.138]  Great point.
[02:04:59.138 --> 02:04:59.498]  Stay there.
[02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:04.011]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.011 --> 02:05:07.633]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:12.215]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.215 --> 02:05:17.798]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.098 --> 02:05:22.862]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.862 --> 02:05:26.485]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:31.309]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.309 --> 02:05:37.874]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.874 --> 02:05:39.816]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.296 --> 02:05:43.498]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.498 --> 02:05:48.001]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:49.802]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:05:49.802 --> 02:05:50.162]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.162 --> 02:05:50.222]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.222 --> 02:05:50.783]  Don't wait.
[02:05:50.783 --> 02:05:51.223]  Call today.
[02:06:01.308 --> 02:06:04.309]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.309 --> 02:06:09.652]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.652 --> 02:06:11.693]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.693 --> 02:06:16.695]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.695 --> 02:06:17.876]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.876 --> 02:06:19.016]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.016 --> 02:06:20.897]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.897 --> 02:06:21.958]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.958 --> 02:06:24.159]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.159 --> 02:06:25.499]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.499 --> 02:06:26.820]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:32.286]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.286 --> 02:06:35.891]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.891 --> 02:06:39.695]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.695 --> 02:06:40.936]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.936 --> 02:06:41.837]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.837 --> 02:06:42.939]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.939 --> 02:06:43.680]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:44.681]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.941 --> 02:06:48.006]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.006 --> 02:06:49.768]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:50.690]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.307 --> 02:07:05.614]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.614 --> 02:07:10.160]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.423]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.423 --> 02:07:14.065]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.065 --> 02:07:15.087]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.307 --> 02:07:23.729]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.729 --> 02:07:31.191]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.191 --> 02:07:36.833]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[02:07:37.333 --> 02:07:38.394]  The American people
[02:08:03.522 --> 02:08:16.586]  Having been educated as to the truth, then have to rise up and demand and get a government that starts serving them.
[02:08:16.586 --> 02:08:22.427]  We need a change and it isn't going to come from Democrats and Republicans.
[02:08:22.427 --> 02:08:24.328]  It has to come from the Americans.
[02:08:26.442 --> 02:08:29.583]  It's the greatest form of patriotism, and I believe that.
[02:08:29.583 --> 02:08:37.345]  Because if you don't hold your elected officials' feet to the fire and pay attention, you are going to get bad government.
[02:08:37.345 --> 02:08:44.446]  So it's imperative for all of us, it's our job as citizens of this great country to pay attention.
[02:08:44.446 --> 02:08:48.047]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:08:48.047 --> 02:08:51.688]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:08:53.436 --> 02:08:59.701]  America is a prize coveted by the despotic megacorporations that now dominate our planet.
[02:08:59.701 --> 02:09:06.407]  If their world government is truly to rise, freedom and the republic for which it stands must fall.
[02:09:06.407 --> 02:09:12.171]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[02:09:12.171 --> 02:09:16.335]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[02:09:17.932 --> 02:09:34.154]  For many generations into the future, our progeny will look back on this time as either a place where humanity rose to the challenge and made a stand against the forces of darkness, or as a time when the planet fell into the grip of a merciless high-tech tyranny.
[02:09:42.617 --> 02:09:49.082]  In Part 2 of Fall of the Republic, you will learn the Elite's master plan for humanity.
[02:09:49.082 --> 02:10:02.293]  But more importantly, you will learn how to stop that plan, reverse the criminal tide, and reignite the flame of liberty on the long march to man's ultimate destiny.
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:13.943]  That is the last few minutes of Fall of the Republic.
[02:10:15.239 --> 02:10:37.409]  And it covers who the globalists are, what their master plan is, how the banks control the government, how the Federal Reserve is private, that we must audit the Fed and abolish it and bring this illegitimate shadow government to justice, or nothing we do with Republicans or Democrats, or any other party for that matter, is ever going to change anything.
[02:10:37.409 --> 02:10:39.850]  In 1913, there was a financial coup in America.
[02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:45.641]  They slowly took over the nation, used our wealth to take over the rest of the world.
[02:10:45.641 --> 02:10:51.184]  Now they are imploding our economy to fold us into the one world government.
[02:10:51.184 --> 02:10:55.846]  You can learn the master plan though right now with Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:10:55.846 --> 02:10:57.166]  This is not fiction.
[02:10:57.166 --> 02:10:59.107]  They are poisoning their water.
[02:10:59.107 --> 02:11:01.368]  They are poisoning your vaccines.
[02:11:01.368 --> 02:11:02.649]  They are chemtrailing you.
[02:11:02.649 --> 02:11:06.510]  They admit they're trying to reduce our numbers and sterilize us.
[02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:09.772]  It's in their own publications like Ecoscience.
[02:11:09.772 --> 02:11:10.332]  Endgame
[02:11:12.463 --> 02:11:18.829]  Explains what their final goal is, that world government is only the beginning.
[02:11:18.829 --> 02:11:23.114]  As the back says, for the New World Order, a world government is just the beginning.
[02:11:23.114 --> 02:11:34.185]  Once in place, they can engage their plan to exterminate 80% of the world's population while enabling the elites to have access to the life extension technologies and other advanced technologies.
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:38.181]  This film is so important, Endgame.
[02:11:38.181 --> 02:11:42.642]  But a lot has happened in the last two and a half, three years since Endgame came out.
[02:11:42.642 --> 02:11:51.664]  Fall of the Republic 2 is going to be on what the world is gonna look like if they're able to succeed.
[02:11:51.664 --> 02:11:59.947]  Fall of the Republic 1 is who they are, what they are, what their plan is, what they're currently doing, information on how to stop them, to identify them.
[02:11:59.947 --> 02:12:01.427]  Identifying them is half the battle.
[02:12:03.007 --> 02:12:06.151]  Identifying that presidents are only puppets to these people.
[02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:09.234]  That presidents are meant to take all the heat, take all the blame.
[02:12:09.234 --> 02:12:12.558]  And then they're replaced with a new puppet.
[02:12:12.558 --> 02:12:15.941]  And a lot of my listeners, we've never gotten rave reviews like this.
[02:12:15.941 --> 02:12:19.325]  I mean, this is almost unanimous positive reviews.
[02:12:19.325 --> 02:12:21.347]  It's the slickest, the best done film we've made.
[02:12:22.216 --> 02:12:40.255]  But the few complaints I get, and we've posted some of these videos, we have some of the reviews up on Infowars.com today, are, yeah, I think this is really a great film, it's slick, it's got, you know, 19 different people interviewed, it's got a lot of good information, but I already knew all this from listening to your show.
[02:12:41.036 --> 02:12:42.976]  Or I already knew this from my own research.
[02:12:42.976 --> 02:12:45.897]  Yes, I know you know about this.
[02:12:45.897 --> 02:12:52.578]  But do you have something that's slickly put together, vetted, documented, researched?
[02:12:52.578 --> 02:12:57.219]  We have a bibliography at followtherepublic.com.
[02:12:57.219 --> 02:12:58.679]  It was just completed.
[02:12:58.679 --> 02:13:02.220]  I believe Kurt's already linked to it today.
[02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:07.461]  But the issue is, you have a well-done tool.
[02:13:07.461 --> 02:13:09.121]  Something that's really effective and
[02:13:11.761 --> 02:13:13.643]  Compelling that you can give people.
[02:13:13.643 --> 02:13:16.245]  Yes, I know you know all about the New World Order.
[02:13:16.245 --> 02:13:22.610]  So do I. I learn more all the time, but I understand the basics.
[02:13:22.610 --> 02:13:26.633]  We understand the architecture, but play by play, new things happen.
[02:13:26.633 --> 02:13:28.354]  Yes, I know you know.
[02:13:28.354 --> 02:13:30.696]  I know you're aware of what's going on, but
[02:13:32.008 --> 02:13:35.711]  Do your friends, your family, your neighbor, your community, are they aware?
[02:13:35.711 --> 02:13:36.952]  See, that's the whole point.
[02:13:36.952 --> 02:13:42.057]  If you're aware, people aren't going to learn about this just magically.
[02:13:42.057 --> 02:13:46.040]  You're going to send out brainwaves to them psychically and make them understand.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.241]  You need to speak to them.
[02:13:47.241 --> 02:13:48.603]  You need to talk to them.
[02:13:48.603 --> 02:13:49.984]  You need to reach out to them.
[02:13:49.984 --> 02:13:51.045]  This is life and death.
[02:13:53.243 --> 02:13:56.444]  Now, until five minutes into the next hour, Dale Rundis is going to be joining us.
[02:13:56.444 --> 02:13:59.906]  He had a family medical emergency, and so he's not in studio with us.
[02:13:59.906 --> 02:14:01.806]  I wanted to have him in studio with us.
[02:14:01.806 --> 02:14:04.727]  But he's going to be joining us for the balance of the hour here in just a moment.
[02:14:04.727 --> 02:14:06.768]  And we'll have open phones while he's with us.
[02:14:06.768 --> 02:14:11.590]  Then, Hilmer von Kampy, a Hitler-Ugan under Hitler.
[02:14:11.590 --> 02:14:13.250]  Obviously, he's a Hitler-Ugan under Hitler.
[02:14:13.250 --> 02:14:16.072]  That's kind of overdoing it.
[02:14:17.887 --> 02:14:25.991]  A Hitlerjugend under Hitler, and he was also in the German military under Hitler.
[02:14:25.991 --> 02:14:34.015]  He's going to talk about parallels between our society today and what he saw as a Hitler youth and then as a soldier in Hitler's army.
[02:14:34.015 --> 02:14:40.117]  So that's coming up in the last 50 minutes of the last hour today.
[02:14:40.117 --> 02:14:42.859]  But please, listeners, please!
[02:14:44.574 --> 02:15:11.975]  Get Fall of the Republic on DVD so you have it in the highest quality, make copies of it, give it to people, or if you have basic internet savvy, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, takes one minute to sign up, one minute to sign up with your passcode, go click on the DivX version, there's five different versions up there, ultra, super high quality, high quality, medium quality, and then just passable, but that's better than YouTube and Google, and you can
[02:15:13.686 --> 02:15:20.990]  Burned DivX copies to regular CDs and they play in almost all the new DVD players and a lot of the old ones.
[02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:27.294]  Because in the last three or four years, most players have DivX on them.
[02:15:27.294 --> 02:15:30.616]  Or you can say, if this doesn't play on your DVD player, it'll play on your computer.
[02:15:30.616 --> 02:15:32.637]  It's a computer copy.
[02:15:32.637 --> 02:15:34.959]  And it's not as good as the original DVD, but it's close!
[02:15:36.607 --> 02:15:41.511]  So, Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:15:41.511 --> 02:15:42.893]  888-253-3139.
[02:15:42.893 --> 02:15:47.456]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at P.O.
[02:15:47.456 --> 02:15:51.240]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:53.061]  Okay, we're going to Darrell Rundess in a moment.
[02:15:53.061 --> 02:15:54.483]  I appreciate him joining us today.
[02:15:54.483 --> 02:15:57.605]  I wanted to go back to Rebel in Canada.
[02:15:57.605 --> 02:16:00.348]  He is an immigrant in Canada from
[02:16:01.573 --> 02:16:02.954]  Central Asian nation.
[02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:15.821]  I'm familiar with the coup that took place a few years ago, but he wants to explain how he believes Obama or the future savior can declare martial law, announce there was an attempted coup.
[02:16:15.821 --> 02:16:17.182]  Saddam Hussein did this.
[02:16:17.182 --> 02:16:19.704]  Hitler did this repeatedly.
[02:16:19.704 --> 02:16:26.528]  The czars loved having political purges in the name of stopping or fighting coups.
[02:16:27.884 --> 02:16:31.507]  And so we hear the media saying there's going to be a military coup, there's going to be a military coup.
[02:16:31.507 --> 02:16:37.171]  If there was a real military coup, nine times out of ten, those turn out being even worse than what you had.
[02:16:37.171 --> 02:16:38.932]  So we don't want that.
[02:16:38.932 --> 02:16:45.197]  And if there is one, it's probably going to be staged and be repulsed.
[02:16:45.197 --> 02:16:51.282]  And so there is a lot of hype, and this is one of the few ways, a type of false flag, where they could do this.
[02:16:51.282 --> 02:16:56.306]  So, restart where you're from, what happened, what you witnessed, and then we're going to Daryl Rundas.
[02:16:56.306 --> 02:16:56.626]  Go ahead.
[02:16:57.799 --> 02:17:04.165]  Yes Alex, I'm glad you pointed out correctly, these coups are taking place over and over again in history.
[02:17:04.165 --> 02:17:21.282]  But what I was pointing out is, after this staged coup, literally several hours later, the dictator, the current dictator, went broadcasting, naming the names of the alleged conspirators, in quotes,
[02:17:22.211 --> 02:17:31.118]  And one of the names, most of the names in the list, were the current opposition at that time to the regime.
[02:17:31.118 --> 02:17:43.788]  And the head of the opposition was a former politician and ambassador of the same country who was organizing the day after of that
[02:17:44.714 --> 02:17:52.621]  The day after that coup was supposed to be the major demonstration event that he was organizing from overseas.
[02:17:52.621 --> 02:18:00.968]  This former politician, his name is Boris Shevmuradov, and he was named as one of the main conspirators.
[02:18:00.968 --> 02:18:11.637]  And of course, they rounded him up and they rounded all his friends, family, not just his friends, you know, all of the people who thought the same way that he did.
[02:18:12.458 --> 02:18:14.601]  And what is codified into federal law now, just like
[02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:30.292]  Texas police take blood without warrants now.
[02:18:30.292 --> 02:18:33.615]  Once they get rid of your checks and balances, it's over.
[02:18:33.615 --> 02:18:34.916]  We have secret arrest.
[02:18:34.916 --> 02:18:36.638]  We have indefinite detention.
[02:18:36.638 --> 02:18:39.300]  We have enemy combatant status for citizens.
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:40.861]  They're building these secret camps.
[02:18:40.861 --> 02:18:44.784]  It just came out, new ghost sites found in Eastern Europe.
[02:18:44.784 --> 02:18:51.530]  And that's the big issue here, is that those very forms of tyranny are being set up in the United States and Europe, Western Europe.
[02:18:52.595 --> 02:19:00.618]  And if I remember correctly, that dictator also admittedly tortures people to then get fake confessions.
[02:19:00.618 --> 02:19:04.099]  Again, tell folks where your former country is located.
[02:19:04.099 --> 02:19:05.139]  That was my next point.
[02:19:05.139 --> 02:19:18.503]  The day after, the next morning, there was a broadcasted tape, the national TV, the next morning after this fake coup, there was a tape broadcasted on national TV on all the channels.
[02:19:19.159 --> 02:19:39.710]  Over this, Borisov Muradov, allegedly the main conspirator, terrorists, in quotes, reading off the papers saying he's a terrorist, he's on the wrong path, he regrets everything he's done, now he recognizes it, and if any doctor, scientist, you know, psychologist, just looked at the
[02:19:40.527 --> 02:19:41.368]  No, no, no.
[02:19:41.368 --> 02:19:49.219]  What they do is they march your children in and they say, look, we're going to rape and kill your children with battery acid if you don't say you did it.
[02:19:49.219 --> 02:19:53.145]  And they go and do it, just like they do with the 9-11 conspirators.
[02:19:53.145 --> 02:19:54.347]  Daryl Rund is straight ahead.
[02:20:03.234 --> 02:20:03.514]  I think so.
[02:20:24.036 --> 02:20:26.638]  Get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:20:26.638 --> 02:20:31.322]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[02:20:31.322 --> 02:20:37.347]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:20:37.347 --> 02:20:43.873]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:20:44.273 --> 02:20:49.778]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision dot com.
[02:20:49.778 --> 02:20:52.300]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:52.861]  Or call 269-409-1776.
[02:20:52.861 --> 02:20:53.101]  269-409-1776 today!
[02:21:01.297 --> 02:21:03.478]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.478 --> 02:21:04.319]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.319 --> 02:21:04.659]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.659 --> 02:21:09.702]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.702 --> 02:21:11.323]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.323 --> 02:21:12.083]  Startpage?
[02:21:12.083 --> 02:21:12.484]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.484 --> 02:21:13.584]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.584 --> 02:21:16.546]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.546 --> 02:21:20.428]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:20.428 --> 02:21:23.290]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:26.192]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:26.192 --> 02:21:27.754]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.754 --> 02:21:28.054]  Right!
[02:21:28.054 --> 02:21:31.377]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:21:31.377 --> 02:21:31.937]  Hello, folks.
[02:21:31.937 --> 02:21:33.298]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:21:33.298 --> 02:21:37.162]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:37.162 --> 02:21:40.945]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:22:01.104 --> 02:22:07.768]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.768 --> 02:22:15.892]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.892 --> 02:22:24.056]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:24.056 --> 02:22:28.819]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.139 --> 02:22:34.363]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.363 --> 02:22:38.726]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.726 --> 02:22:39.807]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.807 --> 02:22:43.830]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:44.290 --> 02:22:49.216]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:49.216 --> 02:22:52.199]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:52.199 --> 02:22:53.981]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.981 --> 02:22:54.201]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.997 --> 02:23:04.018]  Remain in your houses.
[02:23:04.018 --> 02:23:09.780]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:11.141]  Will they do it?
[02:23:11.141 --> 02:23:13.762]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:23:13.762 --> 02:23:20.224]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:23:20.224 --> 02:23:21.465]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:23:22.405 --> 02:23:26.689]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[02:23:26.689 --> 02:23:31.572]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:23:31.572 --> 02:23:36.476]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:23:36.476 --> 02:23:41.300]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.

[02:24:16.324 --> 02:24:17.965]  Darryl Rundas is our guest.
[02:24:17.965 --> 02:24:25.128]  Had him on last week for a short segment or two, but I wanted to have him back up today to talk about a host of issues.
[02:24:25.128 --> 02:24:28.810]  He launched YouDoNews.com and TenAndWin.com.
[02:24:28.810 --> 02:24:29.651]  That's a contest.
[02:24:31.667 --> 02:24:33.768]  Well, I mean, isn't that par for the course?
[02:24:33.768 --> 02:24:38.011]  Isn't that what we've come to expect from these people who are, you know, above and beyond the law?
[02:24:59.375 --> 02:25:04.439]  And once somebody is above and beyond the law and can do whatever they want, the sky's the limit.
[02:25:04.439 --> 02:25:09.942]  Even if you have a dictator who isn't that bad, he will be overthrown and someone worse will come in.
[02:25:09.942 --> 02:25:11.403]  And then someone worse.
[02:25:11.403 --> 02:25:17.848]  And instead, things just devolve and degenerate into absolute evil.
[02:25:17.848 --> 02:25:18.548]  Well, absolutely.
[02:25:18.548 --> 02:25:23.151]  In fact, when we have no accountability, no transparency, it leads to tyranny.
[02:25:23.151 --> 02:25:25.313]  And history shows that over and over and over again.
[02:25:26.718 --> 02:25:30.419]  Darrell, so much is going on, but I wanted to bring this up to you.
[02:25:30.419 --> 02:25:31.459]  Abortion.
[02:25:31.459 --> 02:25:40.942]  Even if people out there are for abortion, Nancy Pelosi says it's for eugenics, to quote, help the economy to get rid of more people, so we'll have less taxpayers.
[02:25:40.942 --> 02:25:45.023]  I saw a statistic last week, a caller called, and I pulled it up, it was accurate.
[02:25:45.023 --> 02:25:50.484]  More black people were aborted in 2008, that's the latest numbers we've got.
[02:25:51.144 --> 02:26:16.906]  than were born in 2008, and I guess that's a big victory for Margaret Sanger and the other Nazis, the other liberals, who run around masquerading as touchy-feely liberals, federalizing the country under hate speech laws now that are about control, not about protecting groups, ending, Obama's now signed it, ending equal protection under the law,
[02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:20.011]  Well, I wish that would happen in a roundabout way.
[02:26:20.011 --> 02:26:24.654]  I mean, while obviously Planned Parenthood is just another tool by the global elite to euthanize the poor, the downtrodden,
[02:26:44.259 --> 02:26:53.467]  In fact, I read an article recently where they're incentivizing that by giving people extra money if they'll get, not just an abortion, but they'll get sterilized.
[02:26:53.467 --> 02:26:56.870]  So, you know, and sadly, people are dumbed down.
[02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:57.491]  They go for it.
[02:26:57.491 --> 02:26:59.252]  They think, wow, what, a thousand dollars?
[02:26:59.252 --> 02:27:02.475]  Wow, I could get me that new flat screen TV that I've been wanting.
[02:27:02.475 --> 02:27:03.877]  Yeah, I'll just get sterilized.
[02:27:03.877 --> 02:27:11.123]  So, you know, it's sad that people don't see through the poise and the schemes of these global elites.
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.082]  Absolutely.
[02:27:15.082 --> 02:27:19.029]  Darrell, I want to take calls while you're on with us and talk about some issues that you want to get into, but...
[02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:43.542]  What is it like for you to see the New York Times and all these publications admitting world government is here, admitting the global carbon tax is to fund the world government, admitting it's to destroy our industrial base, as if NAFTA and GATT haven't already done that, and then to still see people running around denying there's a world government and calling us kooks?
[02:27:44.244 --> 02:27:47.747]  Well, as a Christian, you know, all this was foretold in the Bible.
[02:27:47.747 --> 02:27:49.569]  So, for me, it's not too shocking.
[02:27:49.569 --> 02:27:50.830]  It is disappointing.
[02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:52.311]  It is a little disheartening.
[02:27:52.311 --> 02:27:59.857]  But, at the same time, we know that there comes a time, and I think we're living in that time, where people buy the lie.
[02:27:59.857 --> 02:28:01.098]  They're under mass delusion.
[02:28:01.098 --> 02:28:01.999]  They love the lie.
[02:28:01.999 --> 02:28:03.180]  They hate the truth.
[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:07.003]  They won't come into the light for fear their deeds will be exposed, and so on and so on.
[02:28:07.003 --> 02:28:11.467]  So, it is repulsive, to say the least.
[02:28:11.467 --> 02:28:12.448]  But, at the same time,
[02:28:12.930 --> 02:28:14.219]  Hey, we knew these days were coming!
[02:28:14.634 --> 02:28:26.083]  And that's why it's all the more important that guys like you and others that listen to your show, guys like me and other Christians in particular, stand up and say and do what's right and stand up for righteousness.
[02:28:26.083 --> 02:28:36.731]  I mean, hey, abortion is just one in many, many, many tools the global elite uses to oppress us and to track or control the way we live our lives.
[02:28:36.731 --> 02:28:39.213]  And that's not what our country was founded on.
[02:28:39.213 --> 02:28:43.397]  It's not the purpose of the Bill of Rights or the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence.
[02:28:43.877 --> 02:29:01.522]  Well, pro-abortion supporters should know that the historical mainline history is Planned Parenthood was set up by the Rockefeller Foundation, Margaret Sanger said blacks are subhuman weeds, we've got to kill them, and we'll pose as liberals to do it, and they got
[02:29:02.332 --> 02:29:02.572]  Absolutely.
[02:29:02.572 --> 02:29:06.496]  It's the same thing with people who believe in evolution, goodnight creation.
[02:29:26.448 --> 02:29:36.831]  Ultimately, that road leads to eugenics and many, many other things because you keep the value of someone's life when you start to believe that there is no purpose for life.
[02:29:36.831 --> 02:29:37.892]  There was no creator.
[02:29:37.892 --> 02:29:41.393]  There is no God that you'll be accountable to someday.
[02:29:41.393 --> 02:29:49.495]  And so, sadly, there's a lot of people fighting the New World Order who are, you know, falling into the same line of evolution and... Daryl, stay there.
[02:29:49.495 --> 02:29:51.696]  We're gonna come back.
[02:29:51.696 --> 02:29:53.096]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.096 --> 02:29:54.597]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.618 --> 02:29:58.302]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.779 --> 02:30:10.886]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[02:30:10.886 --> 02:30:12.487]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:12.487 --> 02:30:13.568]  It's very real.
[02:30:13.568 --> 02:30:13.928]  I know.
[02:30:13.928 --> 02:30:18.152]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:30:18.152 --> 02:30:21.374]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[02:30:21.374 --> 02:30:29.580]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:36.703]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[02:30:36.703 --> 02:30:45.407]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:30:45.407 --> 02:30:50.129]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:50.129 --> 02:30:50.329]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:56.452 --> 02:31:05.321]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.321 --> 02:31:09.665]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.665 --> 02:31:15.070]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:16.151]  It's true.
[02:31:16.151 --> 02:31:21.855]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.855 --> 02:31:25.438]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.438 --> 02:31:30.142]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:30.142 --> 02:31:32.924]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.924 --> 02:31:36.246]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:37.367 --> 02:31:41.511]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.511 --> 02:31:46.576]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.576 --> 02:31:50.740]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:52.541]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:00.649 --> 02:32:08.397]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:32:08.397 --> 02:32:14.483]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:32:14.483 --> 02:32:17.146]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:32:17.426 --> 02:32:23.712]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:23.712 --> 02:32:27.776]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:27.776 --> 02:32:33.142]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:33.402 --> 02:32:35.482]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.482 --> 02:32:37.223]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.223 --> 02:32:39.743]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.743 --> 02:32:44.484]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.484 --> 02:32:48.185]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:48.185 --> 02:32:51.306]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:51.306 --> 02:32:53.206]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:53.206 --> 02:32:55.307]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:06.172 --> 02:33:08.954]  Alright, let's go right back to Daryl Rundis, joining us.
[02:33:08.954 --> 02:33:12.916]  We're also going to be taking some of your phone calls and covering some more news.
[02:33:12.916 --> 02:33:29.406]  Daryl, the New York Times just calmly came out today and reported that Afghan opium kingpin, brother of the dictator, Mohammed Karzai, is on the CIA payroll.
[02:33:29.406 --> 02:33:33.268]  So the guy that runs the majority of the opium out of the country works for the CIA.
[02:33:35.129 --> 02:33:38.991]  I know the government controls most of the narcotics and launders the money.
[02:33:38.991 --> 02:33:42.472]  They've been caught hundreds and hundreds of times all over the world.
[02:33:42.472 --> 02:33:48.075]  CIA aircraft crash with pure cocaine on board, meaning it's coming from the source.
[02:33:48.075 --> 02:33:53.537]  The congressional report in 1996, the CIA inspector general admitted it.
[02:33:55.014 --> 02:33:57.296]  But then the phony drug war just continues.
[02:33:57.296 --> 02:33:59.177]  And people say, oh, you're for drugs.
[02:33:59.177 --> 02:34:02.599]  No, I'm against the government making them illegal.
[02:34:02.599 --> 02:34:05.301]  I want them decriminalized, not legalized.
[02:34:05.301 --> 02:34:07.622]  Doesn't mean you just go out and buy them at the store.
[02:34:07.622 --> 02:34:14.527]  So that it will kill the black market and get all the money out of drugs, so the market will break down.
[02:34:14.527 --> 02:34:19.890]  And all the foreign countries that have done this, it basically ends their drug problem, by and large.
[02:34:19.890 --> 02:34:21.071]  Really cuts way back on it.
[02:34:22.048 --> 02:34:22.708]  More than...
[02:34:52.671 --> 02:34:55.432]  And so, why no one does anything about it?
[02:34:55.432 --> 02:35:02.215]  Why people, you know, fail to really dig deep and look at where the source of this is coming from?
[02:35:02.215 --> 02:35:05.777]  Why they don't close down the border in spite of the terrorism after 9-11 and so on?
[02:35:05.777 --> 02:35:08.698]  I mean, so many obvious constructions.
[02:35:08.698 --> 02:35:12.580]  People would be good to open up their eyes and open up their mind and seek the truth.
[02:35:15.951 --> 02:35:16.692]  Absolutely.
[02:35:16.692 --> 02:35:22.895]  So, you ran into a Texas Ranger and he just said, oh yeah, we all know they bring the drugs in.
[02:35:22.895 --> 02:35:23.516]  Yeah.
[02:35:23.516 --> 02:35:25.257]  I mean, it was just like common knowledge to him.
[02:35:25.257 --> 02:35:26.758]  He didn't even flat-bat an eye.
[02:35:26.758 --> 02:35:31.621]  I said, so what do you think about, you know, these reports about the CIA smuggling drugs across Georgetown?
[02:35:31.621 --> 02:35:33.522]  That's been going on for years.
[02:35:33.522 --> 02:35:34.403]  We know that.
[02:35:34.403 --> 02:35:41.067]  But, you know, they don't let us catch them except for once in a blue moon, just to make the front page, make it look like we're doing our job.
[02:35:41.067 --> 02:35:44.249]  But how does a police officer then catch a teenager
[02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:54.542]  With marijuana or ecstasy or something like that, and I'm not saying those things are good, how do they catch him with that and then throw the book at him and feel good about it?
[02:35:55.373 --> 02:35:57.034]  Because that's another form of tax.
[02:35:57.034 --> 02:36:03.399]  They bring the drugs in to get us dependent and to literally legalize slavery.
[02:36:03.399 --> 02:36:05.941]  They bring something in that's highly addictive.
[02:36:05.941 --> 02:36:10.045]  They make it cool in Hollywood and the movies and the culture.
[02:36:10.045 --> 02:36:12.707]  The gangster rap and all of it.
[02:36:12.707 --> 02:36:14.028]  The young people use it.
[02:36:14.028 --> 02:36:14.949]  It's certainly bad.
[02:36:16.386 --> 02:36:25.713]  And especially the hard drugs, and then they put you in a private prison that every time I look into it is owned by a bank that's laundering drug money.
[02:36:25.713 --> 02:36:27.615]  I mean, this is so sick.
[02:36:27.615 --> 02:36:39.584]  Yeah, absolutely, and once again, I think, I would hope and pray that day will come when the American people will just get so fed up, they'll quit playing the man's game, and they'll just lay down and quit paying their taxes.
[02:36:39.584 --> 02:36:40.705]  Isn't that the irony of this?
[02:36:40.705 --> 02:36:43.007]  I mean, isn't that the sickest thing of it all?
[02:36:43.007 --> 02:36:44.488]  We fund our own inflation.
[02:36:45.465 --> 02:36:48.889]  It's our tax dollars that give them the power to do these things to us.
[02:37:05.525 --> 02:37:15.308]  Ritalin and Prozac, all the studies show it's the dyes in the food and the MSG and the aspartame that's making your kids bounce off the walls.
[02:37:15.308 --> 02:37:22.610]  Don't put them on drugs whose molecules are even more dangerous than illegal drugs.
[02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:26.671]  I mean, how obvious is it this system is nothing but a bunch of drug pushers?
[02:37:27.776 --> 02:37:37.322]  Well, I think it's obvious to those in the know, those of us that have taken the time to pursue the facts and let the facts lead us wherever they lead us, whether we agree with them or not.
[02:37:37.322 --> 02:37:44.447]  In fact, one of the reasons I became a Christian wasn't because I was at the end of my rope looking for hope and had nowhere to go but to God.
[02:37:44.447 --> 02:37:48.330]  In fact, the last thing I was looking for was Jesus, but through the evidence.
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:57.383]  You know, when I scrutinized all the other religions, and I scrutinized the Bible and every other book ever written by religious people, the Bible was the only one that stood up to the scrutiny.
[02:37:57.383 --> 02:38:03.606]  So, in the same way, I think if people would just look at the fact, quit believing the lie, quit just accepting.
[02:38:03.606 --> 02:38:09.348]  In fact, I ran into a lady who had an Obama jacket that she had made the other night.
[02:38:09.348 --> 02:38:11.829]  And I asked her, why do you like Obama so much?
[02:38:11.829 --> 02:38:13.030]  Well, he's an honorable man.
[02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.890]  He has integrity.
[02:38:13.890 --> 02:38:14.730]  He doesn't lie.
[02:38:14.730 --> 02:38:18.512]  He doesn't do... And so, of course, I started to kind of press her on a few of the issues
[02:38:19.048 --> 02:38:25.611]  I've talked to a lot of Obama supporters on the ground and they say, well he's not corrupt and he tells the truth and he cares about the people and he brought change.
[02:38:25.611 --> 02:38:26.372]  He intensified the wars.
[02:38:49.693 --> 02:39:10.757]  He expanded the secret arrest, he hired nothing but lobbyists, he made government more secret, surrounded himself with the banking elite, you know, continue to pour billions and trillions, run up a debt bigger than all the other presidents combined before him, talk about transparency, yet not one of the bills have they posted online for people to read before they pass it.
[02:39:10.757 --> 02:39:15.018]  But that's the issue, Darrell, I'm going to ask you this, because then the Obama supporter says, well,
[02:39:16.357 --> 02:39:17.918]  So what?
[02:39:17.918 --> 02:39:21.220]  At least he's better than Bush, as if we're saying Bush was good.
[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:32.406]  No, the whole system's corrupt, but when you try to reach out to people, when you try to wake them up, it's taken me years to learn all their tricks.
[02:39:32.406 --> 02:39:35.968]  How do you explain that to somebody when it's a matrix of lies?
[02:39:35.968 --> 02:39:38.669]  I mean, here's a quick example.
[02:39:38.669 --> 02:39:44.973]  Obama took 50,000 US troops out of Iraq and put 50,000 more contractors in.
[02:39:46.423 --> 02:39:47.326]  Obama put 18,000 more US troops
[02:39:50.954 --> 02:39:54.417]  And when he first got elected, when he first got into office, and then another 22,000.
[02:39:54.417 --> 02:39:57.839]  So that's 40,000.
[02:39:57.839 --> 02:39:59.200]  But they never talk about that.
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:00.421]  It was a footnote.
[02:40:00.421 --> 02:40:09.007]  And then the whole debate was, should he escalate 48,000 more to make it look like he's anti-war?
[02:40:09.007 --> 02:40:13.410]  Oh, he's getting pressured to put 48,000 more in, and he won't make a decision.
[02:40:13.410 --> 02:40:15.472]  Oh, look, he's a peacenik.
[02:40:15.472 --> 02:40:17.934]  By making it a political football between left and right,
[02:40:19.594 --> 02:40:21.214]  Oh, Obama's against the war.
[02:40:21.214 --> 02:40:24.875]  Conservatives now become pro-war again.
[02:40:24.875 --> 02:40:31.397]  Democrats are like, well, he's not putting more troops in when he already put 40,000 more in.
[02:40:31.397 --> 02:40:36.318]  And I don't know what you call that trick, but that's just one of hundreds of tricks.
[02:40:36.318 --> 02:40:43.320]  And I know all their tricks now, and it makes my head hurt, Darrell, that I can't explain it to people.
[02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:44.280]  They don't want to know.
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:45.740]  They don't want to understand.
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:47.221]  I mean, what would you call that trick?
[02:40:47.221 --> 02:40:47.901]  A bait-and-switch?
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:51.260]  Pure deception, first and foremost.
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:54.021]  But yeah, it's what is the norm now.
[02:40:54.021 --> 02:41:02.162]  And I think, spiritually speaking, it really makes sense because it says there'll come a time when people will say that evil is good and good is evil.
[02:41:02.162 --> 02:41:03.843]  And that's exactly what we see.
[02:41:03.843 --> 02:41:08.203]  We see people constantly, continually worship this guy.
[02:41:08.203 --> 02:41:17.305]  I mean, they're teaching our kids to sing songs to him and so on and so forth, and they dismiss and don't even want to know the true fact of what's going on.
[02:41:17.305 --> 02:41:17.585]  In fact,
[02:41:18.038 --> 02:41:32.862]  You know, it's interesting that I share with people all the time that, and it's just like this information about the New World Order and what's going on in the world today, the evil atrocities these guys commit, you've got to remember one thing, and we've talked about this before, these people are blind.
[02:41:32.862 --> 02:41:38.863]  They're blind to the truth, they're blinded by the world, they're blinded by a lot of things, their greed, their money, whatever it is.
[02:41:38.863 --> 02:41:41.944]  And you never get mad at the blind man, that's the first rule.
[02:41:41.944 --> 02:41:46.885]  So when they don't want to know, you've got to remember, this isn't an argument to be won, this is just information to be shared.
[02:41:47.521 --> 02:41:49.022]  Well Darryl, I mean it doesn't really get to me.
[02:41:49.022 --> 02:41:52.703]  I am just sick of looking at all the lies and corruption and evil and it's so obvious what's going on
[02:42:16.536 --> 02:42:19.744]  We just need to abolish the whole system.
[02:42:19.744 --> 02:42:21.849]  It's rotten.
[02:42:21.849 --> 02:42:22.591]  You know, it's like a...
[02:42:24.113 --> 02:42:32.340]  It's like if you open up your refrigerator and there's maggots in a stew you made a week ago, you don't pick pieces of it out and eat it, you throw the whole stew away.
[02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:33.321]  How do we do that?
[02:42:33.321 --> 02:42:40.546]  How do we get the population to realize that it's a tissue of lies, a false reality, a great delusion?
[02:42:40.546 --> 02:42:42.908]  Here's the biggest problem I see us facing.
[02:42:42.908 --> 02:42:49.454]  Whether you're a Christian or not, whether you believe in Jesus Christ or not, if people would actually follow what Jesus said,
[02:42:50.808 --> 02:42:52.589]  Our problems would be over very quickly.
[02:42:52.589 --> 02:42:55.290]  They would actually read what he said, what he did.
[02:42:55.290 --> 02:43:02.674]  But, the system created a counterfeit, a Christianoid system.
[02:43:03.689 --> 02:43:13.675]  That is fraudulent, greedy, corrupt, deceptive, pro-war, worldly, ninnying, dithering.
[02:43:13.675 --> 02:43:16.677]  It denies any type of corruption.
[02:43:16.677 --> 02:43:21.400]  It says only serve government, do whatever you're told.
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:28.644]  And so people of conscience see that and say, I want nothing to do with this.
[02:43:28.644 --> 02:43:32.107]  So how do we change these Babylon churches?
[02:43:32.107 --> 02:43:32.587]  Go ahead.
[02:43:32.907 --> 02:43:34.228]  Well, I think that's the key.
[02:43:34.228 --> 02:43:35.948]  In fact, I've got a couple of scriptures for you.
[02:43:35.948 --> 02:43:40.471]  Galatians 5-1 clearly says it's for freedom that Christ has set us free.
[02:43:40.471 --> 02:43:46.133]  Stand firm then, and do not let yourself be burdened again by the yoke of slavery.
[02:43:46.133 --> 02:43:51.816]  1 Peter 2-16, live as a free man, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.
[02:43:51.816 --> 02:43:52.957]  Live as servants of God.
[02:43:54.178 --> 02:43:59.962]  The last time I was on your show, Friday, there was about four or five thousand people who viewed the video you guys posted.
[02:43:59.962 --> 02:44:04.526]  There's a lot of comments on there questioning the validity of the Bible and God and Jesus.
[02:44:04.526 --> 02:44:06.287]  And I don't blame people for thinking that.
[02:44:06.287 --> 02:44:14.433]  I used to think that most my whole life, because I would see the hypocrisy in the church, and I would say, wow, if that's what a Christian is, that's the last thing I want to be.
[02:44:14.433 --> 02:44:20.838]  What I didn't realize is there's a lot of people in the church who still act like people in the world because they're not really Christians.
[02:44:21.272 --> 02:44:24.433]  I can say I'm a millionaire, but it doesn't make me a millionaire.
[02:44:24.433 --> 02:44:26.774]  I can say I'm a Christian, but it doesn't make me a Christian.
[02:44:26.774 --> 02:44:39.279]  If people truly knew who Christ was, what He stood for, and what He was really all about, they would not sit apathetically by while people vote about no prayer in school or no 10 Commandments on public property.
[02:44:40.285 --> 02:44:50.991]  But that's my point, is the new Christianoid religion is about loving corruption, serving evil, dressing up, driving fancy cars, being glitter bugs.
[02:44:50.991 --> 02:44:52.271]  Right, it's like this, Alex.
[02:44:52.271 --> 02:44:54.652]  What you see on TV is not true Christianity.
[02:44:54.652 --> 02:44:58.094]  They say, come to Christ, He'll give you health, wealth, and prosperity.
[02:44:58.094 --> 02:44:58.334]  Right?
[02:44:58.334 --> 02:45:00.255]  He'll make you have a great life.
[02:45:00.255 --> 02:45:03.597]  In fact, I often use an example of two passengers on an airplane.
[02:45:03.973 --> 02:45:07.656]  If I go to a guy on an airplane and say, hey, put this parachute on, it's really going to improve your flight.
[02:45:07.656 --> 02:45:11.879]  You're going to have peace and joy and happiness, and it's going to be the greatest flight of your life.
[02:45:11.879 --> 02:45:16.943]  Well, the guy's skeptical because he can't understand why putting the parachute on is going to improve his flight.
[02:45:16.943 --> 02:45:21.027]  But in an experimental fashion to see if his claim is true, he puts the parachute on.
[02:45:21.027 --> 02:45:21.507]  But what happens?
[02:45:22.034 --> 02:45:24.836]  In a few minutes, he starts to notice the weight of the parachute on his back.
[02:45:24.836 --> 02:45:26.337]  He can't lean back in his seat.
[02:45:26.337 --> 02:45:27.037]  It's cumbersome.
[02:45:27.037 --> 02:45:27.657]  He looks around.
[02:45:27.657 --> 02:45:30.059]  The other passengers are mocking him, making fun of him.
[02:45:30.059 --> 02:45:31.199]  So he peels the parachute off.
[02:45:31.199 --> 02:45:32.400]  He throws it on the ground.
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:36.403]  And as far as he's concerned, it'll be a long time until somebody puts one of those on him again.
[02:45:36.403 --> 02:45:42.166]  He's disillusioned and he's bitter towards those who gave him the parachute because, as far as he's concerned, he was told an outright lie.
[02:45:42.682 --> 02:45:50.625]  But if instead I go to passenger 2 and I say, hey, put this parachute on because any minute you're going to jump out of this plane and this parachute's going to save your life from the jump to come.
[02:45:50.625 --> 02:45:54.706]  Well, he doesn't care about the weight of the parachute, nor does he care if other people mock or make fun of him.
[02:45:54.706 --> 02:46:00.528]  In fact, he probably has sympathy towards those mocking him because he knows what their fate will be when they have to jump without the parachute.
[02:46:01.036 --> 02:46:04.599]  In the same way, when we tell people, come to Jesus, He'll solve all your problems.
[02:46:04.599 --> 02:46:06.160]  Well, that's just not what He promised.
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:09.182]  He never said, in fact, He says, becoming a Christian will make your life harder.
[02:46:09.182 --> 02:46:09.903]  It's a hard road.
[02:46:09.903 --> 02:46:10.823]  It's a narrow road.
[02:46:10.823 --> 02:46:12.405]  It's not an easy thing to do.
[02:46:12.405 --> 02:46:19.550]  So, I would just encourage those people who think Christianity is a sham and a fraud, I would say, you're right when it comes to religion.
[02:46:20.322 --> 02:46:21.723]  Jesus hated religion.
[02:46:21.723 --> 02:46:23.924]  He stood up to all the religious leaders of the day.
[02:46:23.924 --> 02:46:29.768]  Called them sons of hell, brood of vipers, hypocrites, and so on, because they were bogged down into the law and the letter of law.
[02:46:29.768 --> 02:46:31.049]  They loved their power.
[02:46:31.049 --> 02:46:33.811]  They loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
[02:46:33.811 --> 02:46:38.534]  So they didn't care about whether Jesus was fulfilling hundreds of prophecies right before their eyes.
[02:46:38.534 --> 02:46:40.976]  They didn't care he was performing miracles and so on.
[02:46:40.976 --> 02:46:45.259]  They just would try to dismiss it because they wanted to hang on to their control, their power, their money.
[02:46:45.259 --> 02:46:46.860]  It's the love of money, the brood of all evil.
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:49.622]  So to get back to your original question... And the one time Christ got mad,
[02:46:50.462 --> 02:47:00.026]  Well, the bottom line is that, you know, when he came in and he turned over those money changers in the temple, their tables, okay?
[02:47:00.026 --> 02:47:03.668]  Notice he didn't do it to everybody that was in the temple selling their wares.
[02:47:03.668 --> 02:47:08.269]  It wasn't about them selling wares at the temple, as most people would probably believe.
[02:47:08.269 --> 02:47:11.931]  No, it was because they turned the house of God into a den of thieves.
[02:47:12.355 --> 02:47:14.195]  These guys were the bankers of the day.
[02:47:14.195 --> 02:47:15.816]  They were the Federal Reserve of the day.
[02:47:15.816 --> 02:47:22.977]  They had a monopoly on the coins that Jews could use to exchange for the perfect spotless land to make their sacrifice.
[02:47:22.977 --> 02:47:37.619]  So, you know, they would hike up the price and the exchange rate on that because they knew they had the only coin that didn't have a face of an emperor or some other political leader, and that's the only coin that Jews would use to buy the spotless land to make the sacrifice.
[02:47:37.619 --> 02:47:40.800]  And of course, they turned the house of God into a den of thieves.
[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:43.801]  Once again, the love of money is the root of all evil.
[02:47:43.801 --> 02:47:58.464]  And to get back to the original question, really the answer to setting God aside for a second, because obviously if my people who are called by my name would humble themselves and pray, turn from their wicked ways, God would hear our prayers from heaven and heal our land.
[02:47:58.464 --> 02:48:01.905]  But because, you know, setting that aside, it's the bankers.
[02:48:02.287 --> 02:48:08.214]  You know, I think Ron Paul's on the right, and we need to get on board with that and push for an audit of the Fed.
[02:48:08.214 --> 02:48:16.783]  Once those books are revealed and we see the trillions of dollars that's stolen from the American people, hey, maybe people will then wake up, they'd abolish the Fed, and we'd have an honest monetary system.
[02:48:17.671 --> 02:48:18.232]  Exactly.
[02:48:18.232 --> 02:48:30.168]  Look how far we've come, from almost no one knowing about the Federal Reserve being the real power, to the majority of Americans in Gallup polls saying, we know it's bad, let's abolish it, let's at least audit it.
[02:48:30.168 --> 02:48:32.010]  We are seeing major movement.
[02:48:32.611 --> 02:48:43.561]  But it's just not fast enough because the average person is in these phony 501c3 churches where they tell them, government is God, do whatever government says.
[02:48:43.561 --> 02:48:45.883]  If the government says abort babies, do it.
[02:48:45.883 --> 02:48:48.025]  If the government says go to war, do it.
[02:48:48.025 --> 02:48:52.269]  If the government says, you know, do all of these things, do it.
[02:48:52.269 --> 02:48:55.172]  But the entire Bible is the opposite of that.
[02:48:56.069 --> 02:49:02.530]  Well, once again, they stand under the false interpretation of Romans 13, and they say, oh, you've got to submit to the governing authorities.
[02:49:02.530 --> 02:49:06.131]  In fact, there's a gentleman I'd introduce you to by the name of Marshall Foster.
[02:49:06.131 --> 02:49:09.192]  I don't know if you've ever heard of him, but he's well-renowned.
[02:49:09.192 --> 02:49:21.654]  He's a great scholar and constitutionalist, and he understands why it's so important for Christians, the Church in particular, and like me, he blames everything that's going on in the world today on the Church.
[02:49:22.214 --> 02:49:28.236]  If the Christian would rise up and stand up for what's good and what's true and what's right, we wouldn't have all these issues today.
[02:49:28.236 --> 02:49:29.616]  We would demand accountability.
[02:49:29.616 --> 02:49:31.197]  We'd demand transparency.
[02:49:31.197 --> 02:49:37.298]  We would ask questions, demand answers, and we would hold our politicians accountable.
[02:49:37.298 --> 02:49:40.499]  But like sheep to the fodder, man, they're just led.
[02:49:40.499 --> 02:49:44.820]  They just follow, and they don't ever question what that pastor says.
[02:49:44.820 --> 02:49:45.180]  You know why?
[02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:47.361]  Because they don't ever read the Bible themselves.
[02:49:47.361 --> 02:49:50.642]  If they take the time to pursue the truth, the truth would set them free.
[02:49:50.642 --> 02:49:51.242]  But they don't.
[02:49:51.786 --> 02:50:07.792]  Well I just want to add that the groups promoting the atheists, there are a lot of atheists who are legitimately atheists or agnostics, but every time I study the groups that fund and run the atheists, they're not atheists, they're occultists.
[02:50:07.792 --> 02:50:10.573]  And I guess if they can't get people to be occultists,
[02:50:12.273 --> 02:50:30.298]  They will just get them to become atheists and then atheists almost always become supporters of eugenics and abortion and humans are just blobs and humans don't have any great destiny and humans are a parasite and you just can't ignore the fruits of these people.
[02:50:30.742 --> 02:50:37.026]  Well, that's what's so dangerous about those who fight the New World Order, and yet don't submit or believe in God.
[02:50:37.026 --> 02:50:42.409]  The day will come when they'll realize there is a God, and unfortunately, they were on the wrong side.
[02:50:42.409 --> 02:50:45.911]  So they may fight the New World Order until the day they die, but this is the end.
[02:50:45.911 --> 02:50:48.753]  Unless they repent Christ, man, they're gonna end up in Hell.
[02:50:48.753 --> 02:50:54.797]  Unfortunately, sadly, right alongside those that they were fighting against.
[02:50:54.797 --> 02:50:57.438]  Our country, our world's becoming Hell.
[02:50:57.438 --> 02:50:59.720]  Everywhere the globalists take over, we have Hell on Earth.
[02:51:01.530 --> 02:51:08.519]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:51:08.519 --> 02:51:10.602]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[02:52:55.233 --> 02:52:57.475]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:57.475 --> 02:52:58.876]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:58.876 --> 02:52:59.957]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:53:11.972 --> 02:53:14.635]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:53:14.635 --> 02:53:21.040]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:26.085]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:53:26.085 --> 02:53:36.214]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:53:36.314 --> 02:53:38.676]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:53:38.676 --> 02:53:40.257]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:53:40.257 --> 02:53:42.719]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:53:42.719 --> 02:53:44.841]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:53:44.841 --> 02:53:50.005]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:53:50.005 --> 02:53:55.009]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:55.009 --> 02:53:59.112]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:09.798 --> 02:54:12.599]  Daryl Rundus built YouDoNews.com.
[02:54:12.599 --> 02:54:16.902]  He's going to give it to Free Speech Systems, my corporation.
[02:54:16.902 --> 02:54:20.524]  And the next few weeks, we'll be taking control of it.
[02:54:20.524 --> 02:54:23.065]  I appreciate the gift.
[02:54:23.065 --> 02:54:25.066]  It's also a responsibility.
[02:54:25.066 --> 02:54:27.267]  I'm kind of like, oh, Daryl, thank you.
[02:54:29.997 --> 02:54:36.425]  But it is a really nice site, and I want to thank Daryl, because you just go sign up, it's got a, what, a free sign-up, free membership?
[02:54:36.425 --> 02:54:44.735]  Yeah, I want people to understand this is different than YouTube in that, one, it's not just video, it's audio, it's images, and blogs as well.
[02:54:45.556 --> 02:54:51.560]  So you could write a blog every day if you want, then import a video that pertains to your blog and put it right there in your blog.
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:52.500]  So it's kind of nice.
[02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:54.201]  But also, there's two types of members.
[02:54:54.201 --> 02:55:00.065]  There's regular members who just want to view videos, make comments, and rate videos and things like that.
[02:55:00.065 --> 02:55:01.525]  And then there's reporters.
[02:55:01.525 --> 02:55:04.767]  And reporters have the ability to upload media.
[02:55:04.767 --> 02:55:07.809]  So when you go to sign up, look closely.
[02:55:07.809 --> 02:55:09.430]  There's two different types of memberships.
[02:55:09.430 --> 02:55:10.310]  One will just be members.
[02:55:10.310 --> 02:55:12.892]  You won't be able to upload any media if you're a member.
[02:55:13.396 --> 02:55:19.638]  Well, that's exciting, and so I know that you had a family illness, that's why you're not here today, but we need to get you down here next week.
[02:55:34.372 --> 02:56:03.915]  I need to have my IT guys look at this and maybe just keep using the platform you're using, the servers you're using, but try to beef it up, because as soon as I start posting videos on it, well, you've already had, you said 45,000 views when you launched it a month ago, and you haven't even really been promoting it, and it looks great, the site works really well, this is really exciting, youdonews.com, and I don't think people should stop uploading to YouTube, that's where the big crowds are, but then Doppelganger,
[02:56:07.610 --> 02:56:09.410]  Come over here and have a place.
[02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:16.853]  So you've got an archive of your material if YouTube erases your account, which they do to patriots and anti-globalists and Christians and others.
[02:56:16.853 --> 02:56:22.175]  And then as the site gets bigger and bigger, but absolutely, Darrell, it's got blogs, everything.
[02:56:22.175 --> 02:56:24.575]  You really put a lot of time and energy into this.
[02:56:24.575 --> 02:56:26.856]  It is a first-rate site.
[02:56:26.856 --> 02:56:29.617]  Everything I've been wanting to do and have been too busy to.
[02:56:29.617 --> 02:56:31.638]  So yes, we will do a great job for you.
[02:56:32.478 --> 02:56:38.461]  And I'll have you talk to my IT guy when you leave us here in about 8-9 minutes from now.
[02:56:38.461 --> 02:56:50.686]  Hey, I just want to encourage people real quick, Alex, too, that, you know, something you and I have talked about before, and we both just get so busy with so many other things, with wives and kids and businesses and, you know, so on.
[02:56:50.686 --> 02:56:53.848]  Please, folks, do what Alex and I know needs to be done.
[02:56:54.324 --> 02:57:00.270]  Record the news from Fox and CNBC and CNN and so on, and then do commentary.
[02:57:00.270 --> 02:57:04.674]  You have the right under the Fair Use Act to take and then make commentary on them.
[02:57:04.674 --> 02:57:06.116]  I would call it TV News Review.
[02:57:07.442 --> 02:57:10.124]  Yes, that is actually what I'm intending to do.
[02:57:10.124 --> 02:57:18.771]  We are finally getting our permits three months later from the city of Austin in the new area we leased four months ago.
[02:57:18.771 --> 02:57:22.694]  All of that's going on, and it's total fair use.
[02:57:22.694 --> 02:57:26.838]  For folks that don't know, that's how CNN and Fox play clips of each other's stuff.
[02:57:27.438 --> 02:57:35.584]  If you're showing something and commentating on it, total fair use, it makes for a riveting show, and it doesn't have to be high-tech.
[02:57:35.584 --> 02:57:45.351]  Play a clip of it with a TV beside you, make comments on the lies or propaganda, post it, and do it at YouDoNews.com.
[02:57:45.351 --> 02:57:46.511]  Absolutely, Daryl.
[02:57:46.511 --> 02:57:49.494]  That is just an idea I've had for many years.
[02:57:49.494 --> 02:57:52.876]  You simultaneously, of course, brought the same idea to me.
[02:57:52.876 --> 02:57:53.817]  Our minds think alike.
[02:57:54.867 --> 02:57:57.769]  I want to make a whole film analyzing TV lies.
[02:57:57.769 --> 02:57:59.230]  That's something I plan to do in the future.
[02:57:59.230 --> 02:58:00.731]  I would love to do that.
[02:58:00.731 --> 02:58:03.473]  I would love to take the History Channel, which is filled with lies.
[02:58:03.473 --> 02:58:07.857]  I mean, take their latest review of 9-11 and all the stupid stuff they did.
[02:58:07.857 --> 02:58:08.877]  I mean, come on.
[02:58:08.877 --> 02:58:13.861]  Put one single small little I-beam above a breaking fire and oh, see, it melted.
[02:58:13.861 --> 02:58:14.542]  You know?
[02:58:14.542 --> 02:58:17.844]  I mean, it was obvious that they set that up in the history.
[02:58:18.704 --> 02:58:20.645]  Hey, Daryl, we're going to come back and do five more minutes.
[02:58:20.645 --> 02:58:25.046]  When is the other contest going to be announced?
[02:58:25.046 --> 02:58:32.529]  Hey, we'll talk about it when we get back, but because my wife's illness, we actually extended the deadline, and I'll let you know when we come back.
[02:58:32.529 --> 02:58:33.509]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:58:33.509 --> 02:58:36.730]  Yeah, Daryl's wife had to go in the hospital this weekend for surgery, but she's okay now.
[02:58:36.730 --> 02:58:41.472]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:41.472 --> 02:58:46.434]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:52.312 --> 02:58:55.976]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:55.976 --> 02:58:59.579]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.579 --> 02:59:04.384]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.384 --> 02:59:10.770]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.770 --> 02:59:13.013]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.533 --> 02:59:13.833]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.833 --> 02:59:14.353]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.353 --> 02:59:14.994]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.994 --> 02:59:15.694]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:15.694 --> 02:59:17.815]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.441 --> 02:59:34.582]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.582 --> 02:59:39.726]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.726 --> 02:59:54.115]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.115 --> 02:59:56.476]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.476 --> 02:59:59.258]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:18.026 --> 03:00:22.189]  I really can't think Darryl Rund is enough of all he's done.
[03:00:22.189 --> 03:00:31.814]  And I want him to tell you about his latest contest, where you can win a hefty sum for simply learning how to recite the Ten Commandments.
[03:00:31.814 --> 03:00:33.615]  I know it's a serious thought crime, might be...
[03:00:34.816 --> 03:00:44.869]  Maybe legal under the new hate crime legislation, but we're gonna have to go ahead and stand up against Caesar when he says that we can't read and say certain things.
[03:00:44.869 --> 03:00:52.840]  Of course, Romans 13 says, according to the churches, that the Christians should have fallen down before Caesar and worshiped Mithra.
[03:00:55.131 --> 03:00:57.992]  I guess... I guess Romans 13's right.
[03:00:57.992 --> 03:01:00.353]  I guess those Christians were evil.
[03:01:00.353 --> 03:01:03.154]  But Daryl, finishing up, tell us about the contest.
[03:01:03.154 --> 03:01:06.015]  Hey, real quick on that one note before I get to the contest.
[03:01:06.015 --> 03:01:09.256]  You know, the same thing happened to the apostles early on.
[03:01:09.256 --> 03:01:19.940]  And in Acts, you know, chapter 5, 29, Peter and all the other apostles replied to the officials of the government, we must obey God rather than men.
[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:23.241]  And when the law of men is in conflict with the law of God,
[03:01:23.835 --> 03:01:33.799]  It's a clear-cut decision for anybody that's a Christian, or say they believe in God, and that is, hey, if it's lying, cheating, stealing, killing, coveting, and so on, then you ought not to do it.
[03:01:33.799 --> 03:01:35.020]  You ought not to stand up for it.
[03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:43.744]  You ought to stand firm, and not let yourself be burdened, and not to live as a free man, and don't use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.
[03:01:43.744 --> 03:01:45.404]  Obey God, not men.
[03:01:45.404 --> 03:01:48.566]  But as far as Ten and Win goes, you know, God works in mysterious ways.
[03:01:48.566 --> 03:01:51.507]  My wife had an emergency appendectomy Monday,
[03:01:52.045 --> 03:01:54.627]  So, as you might imagine, that was the day I was supposed to be calling.
[03:01:54.627 --> 03:02:00.590]  I sent out an emergency announcement to everybody, not knowing how the surgery would go, what the recovery time would be.
[03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:03.372]  We postponed the giveaway until November 13th.
[03:02:03.372 --> 03:02:10.136]  That's actually a Friday the 13th turnout to be a very lucky day for somebody, where they're going to get a chance to win $20,000.
[03:02:10.136 --> 03:02:12.137]  So, if you just go to TenAndWin.com,
[03:02:13.115 --> 03:02:20.521]  It explains itself, but in short, all you've got to be able to do is name all 10 commandments in order in 20 seconds or less.
[03:02:20.521 --> 03:02:26.045]  If you're the first one I get on the phone, as I draw the names one by one, who can do that, you get 20 grand.
[03:02:26.045 --> 03:02:28.707]  Very simple.
[03:02:28.707 --> 03:02:38.275]  Daryl Rundus, I salute you and your great work, and I'm going to let you talk to the IT guys, to Will and Matt, right now.
[03:02:38.275 --> 03:02:39.816]  I'm going to put one of them on the line with you.
[03:02:39.816 --> 03:02:40.717]  You want to give us the codes?
[03:02:41.860 --> 03:02:54.761]  You do news.com so we can look at it, figure it out, tell us about the servers, give us the number to your IT guy, and then as you said, for liability issues, I probably want to roll that into one of my corporations, and yeah, let's...
[03:02:55.854 --> 03:02:56.735]  Give it some time.
[03:02:56.735 --> 03:03:07.024]  How about a week and a half from now, in studio for two hours, or an hour and a half, and then we can officially sign some documents and paperwork.
[03:03:07.024 --> 03:03:09.326]  We'll get it officially transferred over to you guys.
[03:03:09.326 --> 03:03:16.673]  Hey, how about, and I'll talk to your producer as we get off the line, but we'll check your schedule, not this Friday, but next Friday.
[03:03:16.673 --> 03:03:17.674]  We can come down and
[03:03:18.513 --> 03:03:19.774]  We'll talk some more about it.
[03:03:19.774 --> 03:03:21.656]  You could even do 10 and win from here!
[03:03:21.656 --> 03:03:23.518]  Hey!
[03:03:23.518 --> 03:03:24.379]  See that's the same day.
[03:03:24.379 --> 03:03:27.382]  Friday the 13th and we can do it on air live.
[03:03:27.382 --> 03:03:30.004]  So that way people will know that it's no gimmick.
[03:03:30.004 --> 03:03:31.285]  It's no trick.
[03:03:31.285 --> 03:03:32.487]  We're not making this up.
[03:03:32.487 --> 03:03:33.888]  People are really going to get their chance.
[03:03:35.185 --> 03:03:36.406]  Okay, so you'll have the numbers.
[03:03:36.406 --> 03:03:38.088]  We can have a keypad in front of you.
[03:03:38.088 --> 03:03:39.489]  You can dial the numbers.
[03:03:39.489 --> 03:03:41.050]  Actually, we set it up on our site.
[03:03:41.050 --> 03:03:42.692]  Our IT guy's so cool.
[03:03:42.692 --> 03:03:52.120]  He took the database and had it automatically randomly select a number that'll pop up on the screen and give us their record with their name and their address and their phone number.
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:54.883]  So then, you know, one by one, if I click that button... So you can do that here?
[03:03:54.883 --> 03:03:56.484]  Yeah, I can do it right there.
[03:03:56.484 --> 03:03:59.547]  Hey, we'll do 10 and 1 here, as long as your wife's better.
[03:03:59.547 --> 03:03:59.687]  Yeah.
[03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:02.290]  All right, buddy.
[03:04:02.290 --> 03:04:03.931]  Thank you, Daryl, for all your support.
[03:04:03.931 --> 03:04:05.252]  Well, we thank God for you, Alex.
[03:04:05.252 --> 03:04:08.734]  Keep up the good work and don't let them get in your head, man.
[03:04:08.734 --> 03:04:12.657]  No, I just got a headache today because... I'm not complaining.
[03:04:12.657 --> 03:04:14.018]  I really have a bad headache.
[03:04:14.018 --> 03:04:16.499]  Probably because I've had too much coffee or something.
[03:04:16.499 --> 03:04:18.721]  And I just... I need a vacation, Daryl.
[03:04:18.721 --> 03:04:21.022]  You know, I'm not complaining.
[03:04:21.022 --> 03:04:23.283]  But I want to fight the New World Order.
[03:04:23.283 --> 03:04:25.185]  And that's all I want to do.
[03:04:25.185 --> 03:04:25.485]  And then...
[03:04:26.676 --> 03:04:27.477]  I overdo it.
[03:04:27.477 --> 03:04:29.999]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, as they say.
[03:04:29.999 --> 03:04:39.767]  Well, and that, I think, for you, is probably the most frustrating thing, is that you give your heart, your soul, your mind, your time, your energy, and other people are so passive and so apathetic, it just makes you sick.
[03:04:39.767 --> 03:04:40.387]  Absolutely.
[03:04:40.387 --> 03:04:45.211]  Well, I mean, I thought there were only two sewage treatment plants they were going to put on Lake Travis, just an example.
[03:04:45.211 --> 03:04:48.454]  Now I find out Austin's putting a gigantic sewage plant
[03:04:49.713 --> 03:04:52.254]  And it's going to ruin the lake, and nobody cares.
[03:04:52.254 --> 03:04:56.935]  It's just... That's just one example of something local that gives me a headache.
[03:04:56.935 --> 03:05:01.676]  Daryl Rundus, God bless you.
[03:05:01.676 --> 03:05:04.697]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.697 --> 03:05:10.018]  If you're going into a battle, and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.018 --> 03:05:12.058]  My answer would be, all I can get.
[03:05:12.058 --> 03:05:17.060]  In the battle for freedom, and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:18.000]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:19.361]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.361 --> 03:05:21.242]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.242 --> 03:05:22.323]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.323 --> 03:05:24.525]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.525 --> 03:05:25.866]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.866 --> 03:05:27.407]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.407 --> 03:05:32.671]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.671 --> 03:05:36.254]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.254 --> 03:05:39.717]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.057 --> 03:05:41.278]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.278 --> 03:05:42.199]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.199 --> 03:05:43.300]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:44.220]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.220 --> 03:05:45.321]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.321 --> 03:05:48.384]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.384 --> 03:05:50.145]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.145 --> 03:05:51.066]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.592 --> 03:06:10.718]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[03:06:10.718 --> 03:06:12.319]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:06:12.319 --> 03:06:13.400]  It's very real.
[03:06:13.400 --> 03:06:13.760]  I know.
[03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:17.983]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:06:17.983 --> 03:06:21.205]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:06:21.205 --> 03:06:29.410]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.

[03:06:36.555 --> 03:06:45.241]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:06:45.241 --> 03:06:46.862]  Generate your own pure water.
[03:06:47.182 --> 03:06:48.725]  Right from the humidity in the air.
[03:06:48.725 --> 03:06:49.947]  By calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:06:49.947 --> 03:06:50.167]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[03:07:01.807 --> 03:07:03.569]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:07:03.569 --> 03:07:05.071]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:07:05.071 --> 03:07:06.413]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:07:06.413 --> 03:07:08.355]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:07:08.355 --> 03:07:17.065]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:07:17.145 --> 03:07:22.569]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:07:22.569 --> 03:07:24.370]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:07:24.370 --> 03:07:31.855]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:07:31.855 --> 03:07:36.038]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.

[03:08:02.998 --> 03:08:09.624]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.624 --> 03:08:20.973]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.973 --> 03:08:23.455]  Okay, I have cleared the phone boards.
[03:08:23.455 --> 03:08:26.278]  I apologize to other callers, but it wouldn't be congruent.
[03:08:27.481 --> 03:08:37.912]  I want to open the phones up this hour specifically and only for questions for the author of Defeating the Totalitarian Lie, Hilmer von Kampy.
[03:08:37.912 --> 03:08:41.716]  I had him on for an hour, a month ago or so.
[03:08:41.716 --> 03:08:44.079]  He was a Hitler Youth when Hitler first came to power.
[03:08:44.079 --> 03:08:45.420]  He was then in the German Army.
[03:08:45.420 --> 03:08:48.924]  He grew up in the Hitler Youth to be trained to be in the German Army.
[03:08:50.925 --> 03:09:04.791]  And he has written a book about the parallels between our society today and the police state and everything else in Germany, and this idea of doing whatever the government says, and the government is the boss, the people are the slaves.
[03:09:04.791 --> 03:09:08.173]  He wants to go back to 1776, not back to 1933.
[03:09:08.173 --> 03:09:17.817]  Now, I get a lot of emails, especially now that folks have seen Fall of the Republic,
[03:09:18.976 --> 03:09:30.146]  And they say, so what if they're training the Boy Scouts, the Eagle Scouts, with M-16s to take on disgruntled veterans and to be a brigade serving homeland security?
[03:09:30.146 --> 03:09:31.207]  We'll just wipe them out.
[03:09:32.814 --> 03:09:37.797]  No, ladies and gentlemen, if they're 14 now, they're going to be 18 in a few years.
[03:09:37.797 --> 03:09:44.281]  This is the process of getting people young, indoctrinating them, and getting them ready.
[03:09:44.281 --> 03:09:54.528]  Sure, you might not have been too afraid of Hilmer von Kempi when he was 12 in the Hitler Youth, or 10, but you would have been afraid of him when he was 18.
[03:09:54.528 --> 03:09:55.568]  Okay?
[03:09:55.568 --> 03:09:56.749]  That's the issue here.
[03:09:56.749 --> 03:09:56.969]  Or 20, or 21.
[03:09:58.922 --> 03:10:13.329]  They're taking over the Girl Scouts, Obama's got his domestic security force, City Year, all these groups in red and black uniforms saying, I'm fierce, coming to your door, knocking, trying to intimidate you.
[03:10:13.329 --> 03:10:16.611]  All this is really happening.
[03:10:16.611 --> 03:10:22.894]  And we've seen this in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Eastern Germany under the Communists, Fidel Castro.
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:27.283]  Tyranny tries to take control of the youth.
[03:10:27.283 --> 03:10:29.685]  Obama wants year-round schooling.
[03:10:29.685 --> 03:10:35.010]  He wants to address your children and ask them to aid him in his mission.
[03:10:35.010 --> 03:10:37.832]  This is a telltale sign of corruption.
[03:10:37.832 --> 03:10:48.722]  So I'd like Hilmer von Kampy to recap the keys of his book, the parallels first, between what he saw in the Hitler Youth and in Germany itself,
[03:10:50.376 --> 03:10:55.901]  And the Tattletale Society versus what he sees manifesting in the West today.
[03:10:55.901 --> 03:10:59.104]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls and questions at 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[03:10:59.104 --> 03:11:04.729]  Questions only for Hilmer von Campy about the parallels between Nazi Germany and modern America and Europe today and this system.
[03:11:18.359 --> 03:11:19.199]  Thank you very much.
[03:11:19.199 --> 03:11:20.700]  Delighted to be here.
[03:11:20.700 --> 03:11:21.660]  It was the best ever.
[03:11:21.660 --> 03:11:23.861]  It was a very, very good response.
[03:11:42.199 --> 03:11:45.902]  Well, that was a different story, because that was a television.
[03:11:45.902 --> 03:11:50.846]  They came here with their equipment to my house.
[03:11:50.846 --> 03:12:01.134]  But on the radio show, this was the best ever, as far as the reaction of the listeners was concerned.
[03:12:01.134 --> 03:12:05.177]  Well, it's great to have you here with us, and I want to take calls today to do something different.
[03:12:05.177 --> 03:12:09.100]  But in this segment we have left here, in the next eight minutes, nine minutes,
[03:12:10.307 --> 03:12:21.297]  Let's say you were on national television, you had eight minutes to say your piece, the parallels, the warning from the past, the message you want to get out, you've got the floor.
[03:12:21.297 --> 03:12:35.150]  But I think the most important thing is that we look at the whole picture and not only at individual acts which infuriate one.
[03:12:36.528 --> 03:12:41.953]  In other words, you can attack and they should be attacked.
[03:12:41.953 --> 03:12:53.702]  The trillions of dollars these people in Washington want to spend and debit them to our children and grandchildren is a scandal.
[03:12:53.702 --> 03:13:02.509]  And that has to be fought so that everything, that these things must not be law.
[03:13:02.509 --> 03:13:03.190]  So therefore,
[03:13:04.324 --> 03:13:06.585]  At the same time, morality.
[03:13:06.585 --> 03:13:16.110]  Totalitarian systems, like the Nazi systems, grow out of immorality.
[03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:28.135]  Totalitarian system is not because of poor and rich people, but about God abiding or immoral people.
[03:13:28.135 --> 03:13:30.957]  And that has all to be seen with, from the
[03:13:33.171 --> 03:13:39.514]  From the heart here, from the core, from what, really, what is it all about?
[03:13:39.514 --> 03:13:43.995]  And that is what I learned from the Nazis.
[03:13:43.995 --> 03:13:48.897]  It is all about the role of God in human society.
[03:13:48.897 --> 03:13:56.540]  And World War II was, in my view, the first ideological war.
[03:13:56.540 --> 03:14:01.882]  There were two nations, or two countries, Germany and
[03:14:03.516 --> 03:14:20.347]  Soviet Union, who represented a materialistic ideology, and the so-called free world, which is a democratic Western, a Western civilization.
[03:14:20.347 --> 03:14:28.653]  What made it is that I realized that afterwards, when I began to think about what it is,
[03:14:31.253 --> 03:14:36.935]  It's a godlessness which has brought Germany down.
[03:14:36.935 --> 03:14:42.257]  And the totalitarians, they want to remove God because they want to be God.
[03:14:42.257 --> 03:14:46.358]  They put the state and the dictatorship and the power of the state.
[03:14:46.358 --> 03:14:49.979]  It becomes the new God and everyone must follow it.
[03:14:49.979 --> 03:14:52.480]  Romans 13, Hitler's favorite Bible passage.
[03:14:53.530 --> 03:15:01.585]  That distortion instead of people standing up for individual liberty and freedom and Western culture.
[03:15:01.585 --> 03:15:03.168]  And you're absolutely right about
[03:15:04.127 --> 03:15:07.268]  You know, I mean, obviously you lived it, but I've read the history of that happening.
[03:15:07.268 --> 03:15:14.691]  But I do think it's important, Helmer von Kampy, to show the parallels so that people can recognize it's happening.
[03:15:14.691 --> 03:15:23.415]  To hear from somebody who was a Hitler youth and then a German soldier, to hear about this happened in Germany, now it's happening here.
[03:15:23.415 --> 03:15:30.518]  I think that's what wakes people up to understand that both Hitler tried to CPS and take people's children.
[03:15:31.331 --> 03:15:31.431]  What?
[03:15:58.955 --> 03:16:06.397]  It is godlessness which brought Germany down.
[03:16:06.397 --> 03:16:13.299]  And the answer is, you have to have an answer to godlessness.
[03:16:13.299 --> 03:16:23.162]  We were told in the Hitler Youth and in school that you can pray and sing hymns in your churches and your homes
[03:16:26.358 --> 03:16:28.178]  But you have nothing to say in society.
[03:16:28.178 --> 03:16:29.979]  That's our job.
[03:16:29.979 --> 03:16:47.324]  In other words, they had realized that, as you correctly stated, that if there is an authority above government, they would have a problem with their program.
[03:16:47.324 --> 03:16:51.785]  So therefore, they wanted to push us out of society.
[03:16:51.785 --> 03:16:53.506]  Now, I say that the ACLU
[03:16:54.884 --> 03:17:02.727]  For instance, is the advance guard of National Socialist ideology.
[03:17:02.727 --> 03:17:04.808]  Because that is exactly what they are doing.
[03:17:04.808 --> 03:17:09.590]  They are taking God out of society and they have been very successful.
[03:17:10.202 --> 03:17:19.424]  Well, sir, we actually went and got the archives of the 20s and 30s and 40s of the leftist intellectuals, all the top names.
[03:17:19.424 --> 03:17:23.225]  We have them supporting Hitler on video.
[03:17:23.225 --> 03:17:24.846]  These were hard to get.
[03:17:24.846 --> 03:17:27.947]  We have them supporting eugenics.
[03:17:27.947 --> 03:17:31.988]  We have them supporting taking all the children at birth, and it was
[03:17:32.828 --> 03:17:37.190]  The left in the United States and England and Europe that actually supported Hitler.
[03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:40.391]  People think Hitler was right-wing in that paradigm.
[03:17:40.391 --> 03:17:41.812]  He wasn't, was he?
[03:17:41.812 --> 03:17:45.453]  No, he was the extreme left.
[03:17:45.453 --> 03:17:58.639]  And there was only just about a few days ago that in Germany, there is what would be the FBI here, that is a similar thing in Germany, and they are watching the right.
[03:17:59.773 --> 03:18:12.720]  And they are watching the right, which is a party, which is not a Nazi party, but which has conservative likes.
[03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:20.644]  And they say, now that the FBI, the German FBI decided, they will also watch the left organizations.
[03:18:20.644 --> 03:18:27.268]  And I realized, and the left began to protest that if you go from the right to the left, that is very bad.
[03:18:27.841 --> 03:18:28.762]  Hitler was a big environmentalist.
[03:18:28.762 --> 03:18:31.263]  He had to clean the earth of bad humans.
[03:18:31.263 --> 03:18:32.184]  He was a vegetarian.
[03:18:32.184 --> 03:18:33.685]  He was an animal rights activist.
[03:18:33.685 --> 03:18:34.786]  He was a national socialist.
[03:18:56.918 --> 03:19:26.470]  Yes, that is also another thing, that you have the same evolution theory in school, and not that God created this world and created every human being, but that there was a kind of evolution which came so that you had people out of ape or whatever it is, but they had basic philosophy of
[03:19:27.299 --> 03:19:41.220]  of this guy was that it is the strong who survive and the strong has the right to eliminate the weak and that was of course what Hitler and the Nazis
[03:19:41.741 --> 03:19:43.482]  And that's social Darwinism.
[03:19:43.482 --> 03:19:51.465]  Whether you believe in evolution or not, they've made it a fake scientific debate by pinning down Christians with quacks.
[03:19:51.465 --> 03:19:57.207]  Whether you debate how God made it, they're just saying we're all slime, we're weak, we deserve to die.
[03:19:57.207 --> 03:19:58.908]  That's the essence of evolution.
[03:19:58.908 --> 03:19:59.268]  Stay there.
[03:20:02.515 --> 03:20:06.816]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:20:06.816 --> 03:20:08.296]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:20:08.296 --> 03:20:12.677]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death, all from the swine flu.
[03:20:12.677 --> 03:20:16.358]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:20:16.358 --> 03:20:24.160]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper, due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:26.721]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[03:20:28.141 --> 03:20:28.442]  We're good.
[03:20:44.514 --> 03:20:44.834]  We're good.
[03:21:02.731 --> 03:21:06.753]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.753 --> 03:21:10.015]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.015 --> 03:21:14.798]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.798 --> 03:21:21.202]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:23.443]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:21:23.943 --> 03:21:24.283]  Tim Geithner?
[03:21:24.283 --> 03:21:24.783]  Bernanke?
[03:21:24.783 --> 03:21:25.464]  They're arsonists!
[03:21:25.464 --> 03:21:26.744]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:26.744 --> 03:21:28.985]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:50.158]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.158 --> 03:21:59.268]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:22:01.266 --> 03:22:01.867]  Good day.
[03:22:01.867 --> 03:22:03.569]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:03.569 --> 03:22:03.929]  October 28, 2009.
[03:22:03.929 --> 03:22:05.050]  Gold opened this morning at $10.32.50.
[03:22:05.050 --> 03:22:08.914]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.61.31, $5.30.66 for a half ounce, and $2.65.33 for a quarter ounce.
[03:22:08.914 --> 03:22:09.235]  That's $10.61.33, $5.30.66, and $2.65.33.
[03:22:21.207 --> 03:22:34.832]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:34.832 --> 03:22:36.072]  Is this capitalism?
[03:22:36.072 --> 03:22:43.415]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:43.695 --> 03:22:44.756]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:44.756 --> 03:22:49.119]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:49.119 --> 03:22:50.220]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.220 --> 03:22:51.480]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:51.480 --> 03:22:51.861]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.861 --> 03:22:52.301]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.267 --> 03:23:05.148]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calbin Soap.
[03:23:05.148 --> 03:23:15.331]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:23:57.785 --> 03:23:59.408]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:24:16.034 --> 03:24:24.203]  Tom, Craig, Kevin, Mark, Rich, you'll get a chance to talk to Hilmer von Compey as we start the next segment, the last 30 minutes.
[03:24:24.203 --> 03:24:29.108]  But in this short segment, Hilmer, you've written this book trying to warn people.
[03:24:29.108 --> 03:24:31.250]  You were getting into Hitler loved
[03:24:33.041 --> 03:24:43.188]  And was obsessed with, for those that have read Mein Kampf and read his speeches, read the history books with his statements, he was obsessed with evolution, obsessed with social Darwinism.
[03:24:43.188 --> 03:24:56.097]  That's why the Rockefellers had funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute on eugenics, the Cold Springs Harbor eugenics facility here in the U.S., IBM's Hollerith machines with the tattoos on the people in the camps.
[03:24:57.011 --> 03:25:01.215]  Was to be entered into the machines, how much they'd be fed, how long they'd be worked.
[03:25:01.215 --> 03:25:14.766]  I know you know all of that, but absolutely, when we look at evolution, it's not really a debate about how life develops.
[03:25:15.999 --> 03:25:21.282]  It's saying humans are worthless, humans are blobs, humans are a cancer.
[03:25:21.282 --> 03:25:37.551]  I believe with the churches, they set up a false debate between church and science, like the church was a bunch of idiots, and they'll put an average preacher up going, I didn't come from a monkey, I didn't come from a... Instead of saying, something put us here on this planet, there's a higher power, there's a greater law.
[03:25:37.551 --> 03:25:38.552]  Instead, Hitler
[03:25:39.452 --> 03:25:40.252]  Or Stalin.
[03:25:40.252 --> 03:25:41.873]  He was a big eugenicist.
[03:25:41.873 --> 03:25:43.393]  They become the law.
[03:25:43.393 --> 03:25:45.573]  They love this system.
[03:25:45.573 --> 03:25:51.134]  So that's a key point you hit on.
[03:25:51.134 --> 03:25:52.775]  Did you ask me?
[03:25:52.775 --> 03:25:55.215]  Well, I mean, I'm just saying that's a key point you brought up.
[03:25:55.215 --> 03:25:59.796]  You were talking about Hitler saying it's the strong's right to kill the weak.
[03:25:59.796 --> 03:26:00.956]  Yes.
[03:26:00.956 --> 03:26:05.917]  They didn't allow themselves to kill as many as were against them.
[03:26:05.917 --> 03:26:07.978]  They practically, as you correctly stated,
[03:26:09.631 --> 03:26:23.294]  Made himself to the guard and every disapproval of him was normally answered with the Gestapo and then in a concentration camp.
[03:26:23.294 --> 03:26:39.018]  We had in front of our home, not from our home, from our church on Sunday, we had agents of the Gestapo who took the names down of all the people who entered and everybody knew what they were there for.
[03:26:40.029 --> 03:26:42.170]  It was a kind of intimidation.
[03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:43.511]  And that's the way it worked.
[03:26:43.511 --> 03:26:44.971]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[03:26:44.971 --> 03:26:45.632]  That's the way it is.
[03:26:45.632 --> 03:26:47.593]  But this is only the result of decades
[03:27:06.917 --> 03:27:27.956]  Of violations of the government agencies, of the government structures, where systematically, a bit here, a bit there, a bit here, a bit there, the reality of the Constitution was violated.
[03:27:27.956 --> 03:27:31.500]  And what we have now is everything what they're doing in Washington.
[03:27:31.500 --> 03:27:32.661]  As far as I'm concerned,
[03:27:33.337 --> 03:27:35.738]  It's against the Constitution.
[03:27:35.738 --> 03:27:37.938]  It's unconstitutional.
[03:27:37.938 --> 03:27:45.420]  And I'm really very astonished that there is no... I have not heard... I know that the... I have talked myself to the Tea Party.
[03:27:45.420 --> 03:27:48.901]  They are patriots, these people.
[03:27:48.901 --> 03:28:02.445]  But there has to be some circles where they put together a team of lawyers of... so that you attack what is unconstitutional, not just get trillions and trillions of dollars into debt.
[03:28:03.357 --> 03:28:13.686]  And make organizations which are only aimed at their own population and not at anything else.
[03:28:13.686 --> 03:28:22.334]  All those who are not in agreement with what the government is involved in.
[03:28:23.126 --> 03:28:24.527]  But I don't see that.
[03:28:24.527 --> 03:28:31.853]  I see the Republicans, even Mrs. Snow, yesterday, that it goes to something bipartisan.
[03:28:31.853 --> 03:28:34.575]  No, Mrs. Snow, it's not bipartisan.
[03:28:34.575 --> 03:28:36.197]  It's what is right.
[03:28:36.197 --> 03:28:47.886]  And these things that you bring out as law, that is against the Constitution.
[03:28:47.886 --> 03:28:48.907]  We have to stop it.
[03:28:50.982 --> 03:28:52.783]  Absolutely.
[03:28:52.783 --> 03:29:00.825]  Those trying to violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, they, according to the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, are the enemies of the Republic.
[03:29:00.825 --> 03:29:01.745]  They are the criminals.
[03:29:01.745 --> 03:29:09.608]  But instead, the FBI has been trained, we have their training manuals, and police are being trained, that people that talk about the Constitution are bad.
[03:29:09.608 --> 03:29:10.908]  It's upside down.
[03:29:10.908 --> 03:29:19.171]  We are bad because we're not letting offshore banks become the government and then become God and have unlimited power.
[03:29:20.976 --> 03:29:28.121]  Yeah, I have, as you mentioned, the Declaration of Independence, I have it here in front of me.
[03:29:28.121 --> 03:29:38.188]  And here it says in the second paragraph... We'll stay there, come back to the second paragraph, then we're going to phone calls with Hilmer von Kampi, the author of the book, Defeating the Totalitarian Lie.
[03:29:38.188 --> 03:29:42.612]  Your calls are straight ahead after this quote from the Declaration of Independence.
[03:29:42.612 --> 03:29:45.093]  Your questions for Hilmer von Kampi.
[03:29:45.093 --> 03:29:47.115]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:51.696 --> 03:29:55.620]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.620 --> 03:30:01.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.205 --> 03:30:06.509]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.509 --> 03:30:11.033]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.033 --> 03:30:13.315]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.315 --> 03:30:14.937]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.937 --> 03:30:15.978]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.198 --> 03:30:24.623]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:30:24.623 --> 03:30:32.067]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:30:38.110 --> 03:30:44.135]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:30:44.135 --> 03:30:48.279]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[03:31:02.882 --> 03:31:06.906]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.906 --> 03:31:10.149]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.149 --> 03:31:14.934]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.934 --> 03:31:18.798]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:31:19.438 --> 03:31:21.320]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.320 --> 03:31:26.525]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.525 --> 03:31:29.848]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:29.848 --> 03:31:36.635]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.635 --> 03:31:38.997]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:38.997 --> 03:31:40.579]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.579 --> 03:31:42.781]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.021 --> 03:31:44.862]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:44.862 --> 03:31:50.286]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.286 --> 03:31:59.413]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:04.673 --> 03:32:07.900]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[03:32:07.900 --> 03:32:11.086]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[03:32:11.086 --> 03:32:14.052]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[03:32:14.052 --> 03:32:16.217]  If another Great Depression strikes America,
[03:32:16.707 --> 03:32:20.470]  How will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[03:32:20.470 --> 03:32:24.014]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[03:32:24.014 --> 03:32:30.539]  Patriotfood.com is different, because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[03:32:30.539 --> 03:32:37.646]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[03:32:37.646 --> 03:32:40.388]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[03:32:44.079 --> 03:32:45.179]  They came and took it all away!
[03:33:10.055 --> 03:33:16.579]  Liberty, freedom, rule of law, constitution, the people are the government.
[03:33:16.579 --> 03:33:22.082]  That is the engine of wealth, the engine of happiness, the engine of invention.
[03:33:24.824 --> 03:33:30.908]  But the blight, the scourge of big government and the control freak authoritarians is now upon us.
[03:33:30.908 --> 03:33:37.533]  Helmer von Compey, we're going to get more into ideological philosophy before you leave us, but I promise to go to calls right now.
[03:33:37.533 --> 03:33:40.015]  But you wanted to say something about the Declaration of Independence.
[03:33:40.015 --> 03:33:40.415]  Go ahead.
[03:33:40.415 --> 03:33:53.665]  Yeah, it says in the second paragraph, it speaks of the, we hold those truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.
[03:33:54.716 --> 03:34:07.502]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:34:07.502 --> 03:34:13.505]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.
[03:34:13.505 --> 03:34:17.067]  So that is their task, to secure our rights.
[03:34:17.067 --> 03:34:23.330]  Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[03:34:24.372 --> 03:34:49.174]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government-laying foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to the effect their safety and happiness.
[03:34:51.033 --> 03:35:03.315]  I think that our government and our government and the Congress are acting in a very, very irresponsible way, destroying our Constitution.
[03:35:03.315 --> 03:35:05.996]  And I think it's the right of the citizens.
[03:35:05.996 --> 03:35:10.157]  As you've already said, the roles have been turned around.
[03:35:10.157 --> 03:35:13.397]  What is up is down and what is down is up.
[03:35:13.397 --> 03:35:15.778]  But you don't need to accept that.
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:23.946]  I just wonder how to, and I have no answer to the question, but how to affect our Constitution.
[03:35:23.946 --> 03:35:25.387]  You do it state by state.
[03:35:25.387 --> 03:35:30.832]  You have to have the states not secede, but declare sovereignty under 9th and 10th Amendment.
[03:35:30.832 --> 03:35:39.419]  You have to then march through a mass awakening to take back the Congress, and you have to audit the Fed and arrest the banking leadership.
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:41.881]  That are the true shadow government.
[03:35:41.881 --> 03:35:44.382]  By doing that, we can win this very quickly.
[03:35:44.382 --> 03:35:51.446]  But as you said earlier, we have become a decadent, wicked society on average that made us easily taken over.
[03:35:51.446 --> 03:36:00.290]  So because people are so lazy and decadent, they can't even grasp basic philosophy that is ingrained in the natural law.
[03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:04.853]  But that sounds, the Declaration of Independence is a great threat to the New World Order because
[03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:08.932]  Today, people go, okay, all men are equal.
[03:36:08.932 --> 03:36:11.854]  But that was a revolutionary statement then.
[03:36:11.854 --> 03:36:13.074]  We take it for granted.
[03:36:13.074 --> 03:36:18.738]  Before, kings were sovereign and above everyone, and everyone wasn't equal.
[03:36:18.738 --> 03:36:23.841]  Equal in our rights, not equal in our gifts or what we're able to do individually.
[03:36:23.841 --> 03:36:34.008]  And we are independent, free, and equal to create our own systems and our own wealth without having it sucked off of us by the parasite class.
[03:36:34.648 --> 03:36:52.378]  So that's why the elite demonize the Declaration of Independence because the document written by Thomas Jefferson is the ultimate threat and stands in complete ideological resistance to their philosophy of the collectivist parasite system.
[03:36:52.378 --> 03:36:54.600]  Let's talk to Todd in Florida.
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:37:02.384]  You're on the air with former Hitler, Jürgen, and former German military man in World War II, Hilmar von Kampi.
[03:37:02.384 --> 03:37:03.685]  Go ahead, Todd, you're on the air.
[03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:06.171]  Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[03:37:06.171 --> 03:37:10.493]  Thanks, Von Kampen, for coming in here and taking the time to talk to us.
[03:37:10.493 --> 03:37:12.314]  I had two questions.
[03:37:12.314 --> 03:37:20.559]  One that was directed to you, Alex, and one that was directed to Von Kampen in regards to the parallels in our current government in Nazi Germany.
[03:37:20.559 --> 03:37:29.425]  First, you know, my first question kind of leads into my second one, but basically, Alex, my fiancé just gave birth to a one-month-old baby.
[03:37:30.266 --> 03:37:34.490]  Um, or excuse me, is one month now, but of course the doctors are pushing some of the vaccines on.
[03:37:34.490 --> 03:37:38.793]  My first question is, one, did you give your kids when they were young... No.
[03:37:38.793 --> 03:37:39.434]  ...the hepatitis?
[03:37:39.434 --> 03:37:40.675]  They never had one.
[03:37:40.675 --> 03:37:41.355]  No, no, no.
[03:37:41.355 --> 03:37:44.318]  No, my children never had one vaccine.
[03:37:44.318 --> 03:37:48.361]  Okay, I'm a huge fan, and I just always wanted to know that, especially since I have a young baby now.
[03:37:48.361 --> 03:37:55.107]  And for Mr. Von Kamp, I wanted to talk to you about the parallels between the vaccinations that are going on now, the ones that they're trying to push on everybody,
[03:37:55.526 --> 03:37:56.507]  Honestly, I can't remember.
[03:37:56.507 --> 03:37:59.769]  I know that there were some injections at the time, but there was nothing.
[03:37:59.769 --> 03:38:00.650]  I mean, I was a boy.
[03:38:27.139 --> 03:38:45.559]  It's very difficult to compare because we are now 60-70 years later and the medicine has been developing fast in many aspects and what they had at that time in Germany I have to admit I don't really know.
[03:38:46.963 --> 03:38:52.287]  But they did use the medical tyranny to euthanize, to abort babies, to kill babies.
[03:38:52.287 --> 03:38:53.488]  I think that was a larger issue.
[03:38:53.488 --> 03:38:54.529]  But thank you, Todd.
[03:38:54.529 --> 03:38:55.710]  Craig in Kentucky.
[03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:56.670]  Craig, you're on the air.
[03:38:56.670 --> 03:38:57.611]  Go ahead.
[03:38:57.611 --> 03:38:58.872]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:38:58.872 --> 03:39:00.453]  Pretty good.
[03:39:00.453 --> 03:39:10.901]  Mr. Von Compey, was there any type of town hall meetings implemented before Mr. Hitler went completely berserk into totalitarian government?
[03:39:11.562 --> 03:39:15.825]  No, there were, as far as I know, there wasn't anything of this nature.
[03:39:15.825 --> 03:39:31.414]  I think each party, you had a very strong communist party and also a strong socialist party, and they used to have their own reunions from their party point of view.
[03:39:31.414 --> 03:39:33.795]  And the Storm Troopers, S.A.
[03:39:33.795 --> 03:39:40.599]  as we called it, was the task, they were the force, Nazi force,
[03:39:45.742 --> 03:40:06.431]  And by the way, that was one reason Hitler came to power and stayed in power, was because as bad as Hitler was, people were even more afraid of the Communists and the Socialists, because people knew about the death camps and mass murder in Russia, and they knew the Soviets were behind these groups, so that was one thing that drove people into Hitler's arms.
[03:40:06.431 --> 03:40:08.472]  Correct, Mr. Von Campy?
[03:40:08.996 --> 03:40:14.301]  Yeah, I think there was no secret in the Soviet Union.
[03:40:14.301 --> 03:40:16.063]  In Germany it was different.
[03:40:16.063 --> 03:40:18.306]  Most people did not know about the Holocaust.
[03:40:18.306 --> 03:40:19.887]  I had no idea.
[03:40:19.887 --> 03:40:25.773]  But we all knew about the discrimination which the Jews had to suffer.
[03:40:25.773 --> 03:40:30.358]  And there was no national outcry because, and that is also a similarity,
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:36.361]  Because the people were comfortable and they didn't want to run no risk.
[03:40:36.361 --> 03:40:37.202]  You mean the 50 million?
[03:40:37.202 --> 03:40:39.102]  That were aborted here in America, no?
[03:40:39.102 --> 03:40:42.383]  Yeah, there is no difference between killing a live human being within his or her mother
[03:40:58.493 --> 03:41:19.301]  And if you push a Jew into a gas chamber, that is the same killing, which is against God, and that we have a government with this immorality, representing us and making our laws, representing us in other countries, I think it's disgusting.
[03:41:19.301 --> 03:41:20.341]  Alright, thank you.
[03:41:20.341 --> 03:41:21.482]  Anything else, Craig?
[03:41:21.482 --> 03:41:25.363]  And I want to say that I have plenty of information on these questions.
[03:41:28.140 --> 03:41:32.183]  As far as I know, in my book, which you can get at my website.
[03:41:47.382 --> 03:41:51.705]  We're a constitutional republic, and I don't think people actually understand what's going on.
[03:41:51.705 --> 03:41:52.405]  Exactly.
[03:41:52.405 --> 03:41:54.106]  Hitler was a democracy.
[03:41:54.106 --> 03:41:55.087]  He was elected.
[03:41:55.087 --> 03:41:58.969]  He then set up a tyranny after democracy got him there.
[03:41:58.969 --> 03:42:11.157]  In a republic, if 51% say, we're going to tax the other 49, or we're going to take their property, you can't do it, because rule of law protects the minority as well as the majority.
[03:42:11.157 --> 03:42:15.479]  But in a democracy, they can put the carbon taxes on you.
[03:42:15.479 --> 03:42:16.460]  They can enslave you.
[03:42:17.020 --> 03:42:18.422]  And that's what's happening.
[03:42:18.422 --> 03:42:22.546]  If 51% says restrict their First Amendment, it happens.
[03:42:22.546 --> 03:42:24.208]  But not in a republic.
[03:42:24.208 --> 03:42:25.750]  Kevin in Texas.
[03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:27.752]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[03:42:27.752 --> 03:42:28.733]  Hi, Mr. Von Campy.
[03:42:28.733 --> 03:42:30.695]  I'd like to ask two questions, if I may.
[03:42:30.695 --> 03:42:35.761]  I was wondering if you believe that you were successfully propagandized as a child
[03:42:36.782 --> 03:42:46.147]  And also, with the Nazi morals that they were pushing on you, did they differ from that of the morals of your parents and grandparents?
[03:42:46.147 --> 03:42:51.269]  And if so, what were the tactics that they used to try to get you onto their side?
[03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:53.210]  Yeah, how did they help break up families?
[03:42:53.210 --> 03:43:00.154]  I mean, families were still together, but how did they, because you said there was a split in your family, but it was kept private, how did they turn the youth against their parents?
[03:43:02.959 --> 03:43:05.141]  I don't think they were successful.
[03:43:05.141 --> 03:43:09.724]  The question is up to where can they influence people.
[03:43:09.724 --> 03:43:12.966]  And there are two sides.
[03:43:12.966 --> 03:43:20.550]  One, for instance, it was forbidden and menaced with capital treatment.
[03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:25.393]  You will be killed if you listen to foreign radios.
[03:43:25.393 --> 03:43:31.137]  My father used to listen to German-speaking broadcasts from Britain.
[03:43:31.903 --> 03:43:35.645]  And from Switzerland at 10 o'clock at night.
[03:43:35.645 --> 03:43:39.828]  But the problem you are putting forward is how did they do it?
[03:43:39.828 --> 03:43:44.791]  They ask questions at the children about their parents, what they are, how are you doing?
[03:43:44.791 --> 03:44:00.721]  There are many ways of you can ask children and they hope that this way they can get hold of the parents if they recognize if there's anything which is against the Third Reich, against the Hitler regime.
[03:44:01.516 --> 03:44:04.418]  So they told the children to spy on their parents?
[03:44:04.418 --> 03:44:06.460]  Yeah, but they didn't call it this way.
[03:44:06.460 --> 03:44:18.029]  I mean, that was a very harmless question, and the child would deliver his or her parents without even knowing what... Exactly!
[03:44:18.029 --> 03:44:28.577]  Public schools nationwide have free federal computers, and this has now been declassified, and they have you write a journal in 6th and 7th grade about your family, and they ask,
[03:44:29.398 --> 03:44:31.618]  Do your parents ever discipline you?
[03:44:31.618 --> 03:44:33.019]  What's in the medicine cabinet?
[03:44:33.019 --> 03:44:34.179]  Does mommy yell at you?
[03:44:34.179 --> 03:44:41.600]  And the children are there being taught to type this in or write this, and then it's transcribed and put online.
[03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:51.842]  It's like when I have had children, my wife's had three children, and after the first child I learned at the hospital, the nurse says, hon, will you take this file downstairs for me?
[03:44:51.842 --> 03:44:55.423]  And then when I left, they said, how you doing money-wise?
[03:44:55.423 --> 03:44:56.883]  Does he ever mean to you?
[03:44:58.089 --> 03:45:01.611]  And then my wife's like, no, we have enough money and he's not mean to me.
[03:45:01.611 --> 03:45:03.111]  And well, does he hit you?
[03:45:03.111 --> 03:45:13.235]  And a lot of women are, their water's broken, they're about to have a baby, they're waiting to get an IV in their arm and go into the, and they tell the induction nurse, well, yeah, we're having trouble with money.
[03:45:13.235 --> 03:45:15.136]  Now the health department's called.
[03:45:15.136 --> 03:45:17.237]  You don't have enough money to have the baby.
[03:45:17.237 --> 03:45:18.778]  Now the state's gonna take it.
[03:45:18.778 --> 03:45:25.160]  The spies are everywhere and they don't tell you they're setting you up when they're doing it.
[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:26.361]  Is that how it was in Germany?
[03:45:26.641 --> 03:45:45.889]  Yeah, that's the way, and let me say also that they didn't really, as far, at least in the small cities, and we were living in small, in the small cities, in contrast to what the big cities like Berlin and Hamburg and Munich, that was different.
[03:45:45.889 --> 03:45:52.751]  But they did not try in the Hitler Youth to make us, indoctrinate us and make us Nazis.
[03:45:54.969 --> 03:45:57.950]  We were indoctrinated with ideological purposes.
[03:45:57.950 --> 03:46:15.337]  In other words, what Hitler wanted from us is to make it possible that he could realize his program, which was to expand Germany towards the East and capture land... Yeah, you were cannon fodder.
[03:46:15.337 --> 03:46:20.139]  You were being bred for military service, and it was all under a peer pressure system.
[03:46:20.139 --> 03:46:21.479]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:46:21.479 --> 03:46:22.860]  Kevin in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:46:25.154 --> 03:46:26.654]  I believe you just had me on.
[03:46:26.654 --> 03:46:28.475]  Okay, Kevin, thank you.
[03:46:28.475 --> 03:46:30.096]  I thought they told me Kevin was next.
[03:46:30.096 --> 03:46:31.356]  Mark in Georgia.
[03:46:31.356 --> 03:46:32.696]  Mark, go ahead.
[03:46:32.696 --> 03:46:33.717]  Oh, just a second.
[03:46:33.717 --> 03:46:37.998]  You know, people say how free we are in this country.
[03:46:37.998 --> 03:46:44.800]  I say, yep, we're the freest country in the world, and gosh darn it, I have the government's permission to say so.
[03:46:44.800 --> 03:46:53.023]  You know, people say how free we are, and I point out to them, well, you tell that to Sarah Weaver.
[03:46:53.971 --> 03:46:56.412]  Oh, that's right, she's dead.
[03:46:56.412 --> 03:47:07.836]  You tell that to Irwin Schiff, I don't know if you've heard, he recently lost a toe to gangrene when he was in diesel therapy.
[03:47:07.836 --> 03:47:17.880]  Gosh darn it, I thought he had... Yeah, and I haven't heard his son, who we want to get on about that, or maybe he's commented, has his son
[03:47:19.761 --> 03:47:27.406]  Commented on that lately, when he's on all these TV shows, talking about the economy?
[03:47:27.406 --> 03:47:33.030]  There may be an understanding that if he brings it up, his dad's situation will go from bad to worse.
[03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:34.531]  I don't know.
[03:47:34.531 --> 03:47:48.100]  On U2 News, my user ID is MarkAnabaptist, and I uploaded a clip from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the Bring Out Your Dead scene, about Obamacare, and if somebody can take that and polish it up,
[03:47:48.610 --> 03:47:50.190]  I'd be grateful.
[03:47:50.190 --> 03:47:53.731]  Okay?
[03:47:53.731 --> 03:47:54.252]  All right, sir.
[03:47:54.252 --> 03:47:56.952]  Do you have any questions for Mr. Von Kampy?
[03:47:56.952 --> 03:48:03.154]  I'm just wondering what you see going on here and what happened in your youth.
[03:48:03.154 --> 03:48:07.555]  I understand you see a number of disturbing parallels.
[03:48:07.555 --> 03:48:13.257]  Because what I said to some neocons, what Thomas Jefferson, the word liberal stems from the word liberty.
[03:48:13.257 --> 03:48:16.218]  The founders were liberals in fighting for liberty.
[03:48:17.859 --> 03:48:21.581]  I tremble for my nation when I ponder that God is just.
[03:48:21.581 --> 03:48:24.622]  And the thing is, what is going on here?
[03:48:24.622 --> 03:48:26.223]  What happened in your youth?
[03:48:26.223 --> 03:48:29.384]  You're saying that there's very disturbing parallels between... Yes, sir.
[03:48:29.384 --> 03:48:34.366]  Mr. Von Kappe, you covered it last time you were on, the people just in a shotgun pattern.
[03:48:34.366 --> 03:48:35.787]  But see, they've changed all the terms.
[03:48:35.787 --> 03:48:37.548]  Classical liberal.
[03:48:37.548 --> 03:48:38.688]  The media asks, who are you?
[03:48:38.688 --> 03:48:40.069]  And I go, I'm a classical liberal.
[03:48:40.933 --> 03:48:41.634]  Well, what's that?
[03:48:41.634 --> 03:48:43.575]  Well, it's a paleo-conservative.
[03:48:43.575 --> 03:48:48.759]  Because they've changed all the terms around till they mean almost nothing.
[03:48:48.759 --> 03:48:50.541]  It's liberty versus tyranny.
[03:48:50.541 --> 03:48:53.583]  It's individual freedom versus the state.
[03:48:53.583 --> 03:48:55.745]  But, I mean, the parallels.
[03:48:55.745 --> 03:49:02.711]  The youth being brainwashed, the spies, the secret police, the government knows all, the social Darwinism.
[03:49:02.711 --> 03:49:04.432]  I mean, those are the parallels, are they not?
[03:49:04.432 --> 03:49:10.377]  Well, America should be a nation under God.
[03:49:11.474 --> 03:49:18.275]  That would mean that God's commandment would rule the society.
[03:49:18.275 --> 03:49:22.776]  Instead, they do the same thing as the Nazis did.
[03:49:22.776 --> 03:49:36.359]  And that is not just Obama, that has been going on for decades, that bit by bit the Constitution is being destroyed.
[03:49:36.359 --> 03:49:40.880]  And now we are, that the government can do anything.
[03:49:41.448 --> 03:49:42.829]  Yeah, here's a big parallel.
[03:49:42.829 --> 03:49:45.069]  Hitler had secret arrest.
[03:49:45.069 --> 03:49:49.491]  Now we have secret arrest in the United States.
[03:49:49.491 --> 03:49:52.672]  Yeah, it's the destruction.
[03:49:52.672 --> 03:50:07.138]  Because the founding fathers have... I have a whole package of it, where they say that the American Constitution has to have Christians as citizens.
[03:50:08.214 --> 03:50:13.435]  Because otherwise the structure will be destroyed.
[03:50:13.435 --> 03:50:28.439]  And we have a president who, when he came, when he accepted his speech, he already stated that he wanted to change the Constitution, because according to our Constitution, you can't take out money and give it to somebody else.
[03:50:28.439 --> 03:50:29.239]  But they do that.
[03:50:29.239 --> 03:50:34.760]  They do not recognize the right of people to his properties.
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:37.541]  And they want to control everything.
[03:50:38.089 --> 03:50:39.929]  Now that's the big parallel.
[03:50:39.929 --> 03:50:44.530]  The Nazis would take your property if they wanted to in the name of the state.
[03:50:44.530 --> 03:50:48.251]  Now they do that here and they're saying we're not just going to take it for eminent domain.
[03:50:48.251 --> 03:50:54.633]  We're going to take your property without compensation if somebody else just wants it who gave us a campaign contribution.
[03:50:54.633 --> 03:51:00.954]  The New London Keyload decision of three years ago stated somebody can give a campaign contribution to take your land.
[03:51:02.363 --> 03:51:07.547]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:51:07.547 --> 03:51:11.029]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:51:11.029 --> 03:51:16.753]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:51:16.753 --> 03:51:19.315]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:51:19.315 --> 03:51:23.878]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:51:23.878 --> 03:51:26.600]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:32.762]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:51:32.762 --> 03:51:35.022]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:51:35.022 --> 03:51:43.565]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:51:43.565 --> 03:51:49.527]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:51:49.527 --> 03:51:54.408]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:51:54.628 --> 03:51:56.389]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:58.591]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:51:58.591 --> 03:52:00.332]  Be well and stay well.
[03:52:00.332 --> 03:52:03.093]  Best MZ.
[03:52:03.093 --> 03:52:07.116]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.116 --> 03:52:10.358]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.358 --> 03:52:11.779]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.483 --> 03:52:15.145]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.145 --> 03:52:21.551]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.551 --> 03:52:26.595]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.595 --> 03:52:36.723]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.843 --> 03:52:39.184]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.184 --> 03:52:40.764]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.764 --> 03:52:43.225]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.225 --> 03:52:45.345]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.345 --> 03:52:50.507]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.507 --> 03:52:59.610]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:03.371]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[03:53:03.371 --> 03:53:05.232]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[03:53:05.232 --> 03:53:07.073]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[03:53:07.073 --> 03:53:11.955]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[03:53:11.955 --> 03:53:16.978]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[03:53:16.978 --> 03:53:18.939]  Introducing Choose4Health.

[03:54:06.802 --> 03:54:11.304]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[03:54:14.004 --> 03:54:21.150]  Rich in Ohio, you're on the air with the author of Defeating the Totalitarian Lie.
[03:54:21.150 --> 03:54:23.452]  Go ahead, Rich.
[03:54:37.959 --> 03:54:39.720]  Actually, it's Ridge Runner, but that's fine.
[03:54:39.720 --> 03:54:40.461]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:54:40.461 --> 03:54:42.702]  I've been listening to you for a couple years.
[03:54:42.702 --> 03:54:44.063]  Wonderful job.
[03:54:44.063 --> 03:54:47.626]  Mr. Von Kopp, my wife was born in Hof, Germany.
[03:54:47.626 --> 03:54:48.866]  I am!
[03:54:48.866 --> 03:54:49.467]  Very good.
[03:54:49.467 --> 03:54:58.072]  And her folks were totally against Hitler and wouldn't let him go to any of the rallies or anything like that.
[03:54:58.072 --> 03:55:02.555]  But I want to speak directly to what you've been talking about, Alex, from a quote.
[03:55:02.555 --> 03:55:06.378]  Have you heard of Ernst Haeckel as a science advisor to Hitler?
[03:55:07.037 --> 03:55:10.420]  Yeah, the name rings bell, but I can't remember what it is.
[03:55:10.420 --> 03:55:11.821]  Well, I would like to read.
[03:55:11.821 --> 03:55:16.826]  He was one of the scientific advisors to Hitler, a German evolutionist.
[03:55:16.826 --> 03:55:21.070]  He wrote that Christianity makes no distinction of race or of color.
[03:55:21.070 --> 03:55:24.133]  It seeks to break down all racial barriers.
[03:55:24.133 --> 03:55:28.376]  In this respect, the hand of Christianity is against that of nature.
[03:55:28.376 --> 03:55:33.241]  For are not the races of mankind the evolutionary harvest which nature had
[03:55:33.914 --> 03:55:40.856]  Toiled through long ages to produce, may we not say then that Christianity is anti-evolutionary in its aim.
[03:55:40.856 --> 03:55:56.502]  I just want to say the full title of Darwin's book is The Origin of Species, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.
[03:55:56.502 --> 03:55:59.623]  And Mein Kampf, is that word Kampf not struggle?
[03:56:01.517 --> 03:56:13.371]  Well, sir, no one debates that the eugenics, Darwinistic system, Darwin basically invented eugenics and then Galton termed it, but there's no debating this.
[03:56:13.371 --> 03:56:18.737]  What they do is they create fake science and have quack preachers get up and argue science with people.
[03:56:19.318 --> 03:56:24.461]  When there's evidence of creation, I'm not debating how God created things.
[03:56:24.461 --> 03:56:28.464]  These are mind tricks they play with us to make us look stupid.
[03:56:28.464 --> 03:56:37.810]  We just need to explain that eugenics is wrong and putting poison in the population's water, like the White House science czar calls for, is wrong.
[03:56:37.810 --> 03:56:39.311]  And these are control freaks.
[03:56:39.311 --> 03:56:40.652]  I appreciate your call.
[03:56:40.652 --> 03:56:42.754]  Don in Alabama, last caller, go ahead.
[03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:46.451]  Man, I'm glad I get the last word, Alex.
[03:56:46.451 --> 03:56:56.336]  Thanks for all your hard work and the new movie and I just wanted to say I get to look at Hilmar eye to eye every Sunday and Wednesday night.
[03:56:56.336 --> 03:56:57.317]  I call him a friend.
[03:56:57.317 --> 03:57:09.203]  We go to church together and he's a man of real courage and an amazing fortitude and I think he's the real deal when you talk about patriots.
[03:57:09.203 --> 03:57:11.384]  He's come to this country and I know
[03:57:12.148 --> 03:57:16.516]  Within our group of people, he has awakened us to action.
[03:57:16.516 --> 03:57:23.928]  In fact, we're going to meet tonight to jot up some details of how we can be more effective.
[03:57:25.455 --> 03:57:29.897]  Well, make no mistake, if there's one message I want to get across, we're in a war.
[03:57:29.897 --> 03:57:34.458]  And the totalitarians, the authoritarians, have taken over.
[03:57:34.458 --> 03:57:36.719]  And they are thieves.
[03:57:36.719 --> 03:57:41.601]  And they want to control your life, and they will rob you, and they will kill you.
[03:57:41.601 --> 03:57:45.903]  They'll keep stealing and stealing until the whole society collapses and put us in work camps.
[03:57:45.903 --> 03:57:47.663]  That's in the executive orders.
[03:57:47.663 --> 03:57:49.504]  So people had better get involved.
[03:57:49.504 --> 03:57:51.705]  So, Mr. Von Kempe, you know Don from Alabama?
[03:57:51.705 --> 03:57:54.626]  Yeah, I'm seeing him tonight.
[03:57:55.501 --> 03:57:57.243]  That was a message from Alabama.
[03:57:57.243 --> 03:57:58.364]  I like that very much.
[03:57:58.364 --> 03:58:00.966]  I'm glad you came on.
[03:58:00.966 --> 03:58:01.927]  Alright Don, thank you.
[03:58:01.927 --> 03:58:02.768]  We're out of time.
[03:58:02.768 --> 03:58:06.171]  Hilmer von Kampen, give us the website for folks that want to get your book.
[03:58:06.171 --> 03:58:11.355]  It's www.vonKampen, my name.
[03:58:11.355 --> 03:58:12.016]  Can you spell it?
[03:58:12.016 --> 03:58:13.037]  You can spell it in English.
[03:58:13.755 --> 03:58:18.076]  Yes, V-O-N-C-A-M-P-E dot com.
[03:58:18.076 --> 03:58:19.937]  We've got your name up on InfoWars.com.

[03:58:21.437 --> 03:58:26.219]  The book is Defeating the Totalitarian Lie, my new film.
[03:58:26.219 --> 03:58:32.040]  And if you do decide to order it, you can order it on my website and you get my signature.
[03:58:32.040 --> 03:58:33.601]  I'll send it immediately to you.
[03:58:33.601 --> 03:58:34.261]  Absolutely.
[03:58:34.261 --> 03:58:35.541]  Hilmer, it was great having you on.
[03:58:35.541 --> 03:58:36.381]  Thank you.
[03:58:36.381 --> 03:58:39.442]  And we cover the eugenics in my film, Endgame.
[03:58:39.442 --> 03:58:40.843]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:40.843 --> 03:58:41.463]  Great job, crew.

[03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:17.132]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
