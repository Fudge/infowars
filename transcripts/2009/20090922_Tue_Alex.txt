[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.229]  3-3.
[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:08.652]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:43.943]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz is with us for the rest of the hour with investigative journalist Sherry Cain, who helps him write up his lengthy affidavit he's given to the FBI implicating who he believes the evidence shows is behind the purposeful release of this genetically modified and laboratory produced H1N1.
[00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:53.546]  And we're going to talk about a host of issues with both of these researchers, Dr. Lerner Horowitz and Sherry Cain, here in this hour today.
[00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:58.348]  I want to get into what's in the vaccine, what the adjuvants do.
[00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:08.851]  I talked to Dr. Stan Monteith, who's coming up on the show later this week, medical doctor, and he said it's really bad stuff that's in there, but also that
[00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:18.145]  The CDC has issued a report saying that they believe it's going to peak sometime in the next few weeks as the flu vaccine begins.
[00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.286]  And it's not even killing a lot of people.
[00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.147]  It's not a big deal.
[00:01:21.187 --> 00:01:24.430]  So if it's engineered, why would they engineer something that isn't that deadly?
[00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:31.095]  But then the other issue is we know the adjuvants with the anthrax shots with the troops is what was killing them and maiming them.
[00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:35.779]  So we'll talk about that with Sherry Kane, Dr. Leonard Horowitz, right now today.
[00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.360]  Great to have you both here with us.
[00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:38.561]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:39.242]  Great to be with you.
[00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:40.718]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:42.881]  Well, I think that the facts of the
[00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:56.092]  I think so.
[00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:18.608]  We're good to go.
[00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:48.438]  Well here in Texas, and I know it's nationwide, the biggest chain
[00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.255]  Walgreens aggressively pushes it when you come in the door.
[00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:06.215]  They're like, take a shot.
[00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:06.675]  You need it.
[00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:07.536]  It's for your children.
[00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:13.759]  And they've got bureaucrats and doctors everywhere going to schools, confirming the news, saying you've got to take it.
[00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.000]  You've got to give it to your kids if you love your kids.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.542]  CPS is saying it may be abusive.
[00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:19.002]  You don't.
[00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:20.603]  We've confirmed.
[00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:23.544]  We got the letters from nurses, medical workers.
[00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:34.749]  People working in daycares and public schools, and these are up on Infowars.com and PresentPlanet.com, confirming that Obama's a liar, saying you want to take the shot.
[00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:38.411]  Through color of law, they are pushing this aggressively everywhere.
[00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:42.573]  Sherry Kane and Dr. Leonard Horowitz, what can you tell us about that?
[00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:49.296]  I can tell you that my latest press release is going to be titled, Safeway's Killer Flu Shot Marketing Campaign.
[00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:51.417]  What doesn't kill you makes you sicker.
[00:03:51.988 --> 00:04:00.032]  Steve Byrd is the chairman and he's also the president and CEO of Safeway and the founder of the Coalition to Advance Healthcare Reform.
[00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:04.134]  The organization is called CAHR.
[00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:12.479]  Apparently they're working overtime to promote this vaccination campaign and they are catering to uninsured, low-income, public and blue-collar workers.
[00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:18.312]  Blue Collar workers for just under $30 you can walk into Safeway Bond to get vaccinated.
[00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:20.134]  They get you in the front door.
[00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:25.800]  Somebody hands you a flyer with a big smile, tells you that they get the flu shot in their in-house pharmacy.
[00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:31.167]  On your way out the door, if you don't go for the flu shot, they get you while you're swiping your credit card.
[00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:32.488]  I mean, folks, come on!
[00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:34.250]  A 10% off the average grocery bill of $150?
[00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:48.747]  We're talking about twelve, thirteen dollars.
[00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:51.669]  I mean, they are really pushing this.
[00:04:52.089 --> 00:05:01.735]  With a government with a history of genetic engineering, of eugenics, of poisoning vaccines, of radiating foster children of black men and giving them syphilis, Tuskegee.
[00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:03.897]  I mean, how would anyone trust these people?
[00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:07.299]  Well, that's the greatest point.
[00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:12.522]  I think you really have to look at how persuasive the mainstream media is and how
[00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:22.048]  Malfeasance the officials are to actually say that these vaccines are safe and effective when actually the science disproves all of that.
[00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:30.232]  And one of the big questions actually is who's actually giving out these vaccines in a safe way?
[00:05:30.912 --> 00:05:35.454]  According to the Infectious Disease Society of America, which is not on our team,
[00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:42.844]  They claim that these are travel medicine providers that have no experience or unqualified, untrained.
[00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:45.165]  They don't know anything about the side effects.
[00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:49.867]  If somebody is already not feeling well and they give them these vaccinations, they can be deadly.
[00:05:51.648 --> 00:05:52.168]  That's right.
[00:05:52.188 --> 00:06:01.932]  In fact, a medical doctor or a nurse will ask you if you've already been sick, if you've already had the flu, if you've got pre-existing conditions, do you have allergic responses to vaccines.
[00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:04.093]  And I was talking to one of my employees.
[00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:05.973]  His mother's not in the medical field.
[00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:09.995]  She was offered $45 an hour to go to events and give people shots.
[00:06:10.275 --> 00:06:14.596]  They're not trained in the multi-use vials to use the needles properly.
[00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:15.917]  I mean, this is hellish.
[00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:21.433]  It could be contamination, lots of contamination involved, and I would recommend it.
[00:06:21.593 --> 00:06:23.974]  No one rolls up their sleeve for any vaccination.
[00:06:25.575 --> 00:06:37.338]  One of the main ingredients is the MS-59, and you spoke about that, which has this sub-micron oil and water emulsion of squalene, which is an adjective, and it's unlicensed in the U.S.
[00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:43.760]  You know, the other thing, the additive that is implicated is IL-2, interleukin-2.
[00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:47.279]  There's also non-oxal 9.
[00:06:47.499 --> 00:07:06.128]  What we're going to be coming out with tomorrow are the links between the fact that Baxter's vaccinations are being produced not in the chicken embryo, but actually in the Vero green monkey kidney tissue cell cultures with sp40, simian virus 40 contaminants.
[00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:07.707]  And that's not your opinion.
[00:07:07.787 --> 00:07:11.308]  Build, the biggest newspaper in Germany, reported that three weeks ago.
[00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:12.188]  I know you have new info.
[00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.209]  Give us that new info now.
[00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:22.811]  But they have top virologists in the paper saying, look, this is being grown in monkeys with cancer viruses that will kill humans.
[00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:23.571]  Period.
[00:07:23.972 --> 00:07:24.312]  Right.
[00:07:24.452 --> 00:07:32.794]  And then now you understand why they're putting non-oxal-9 into the adjuvant solution because it's a
[00:07:33.878 --> 00:07:44.692]  But the medical doctors I've talked to have confirmed this is right.
[00:07:45.172 --> 00:07:50.980]  They're saying that with the virus RNA, that it doesn't even kill them, that it just still combines.
[00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:52.928]  That's exactly right.
[00:07:52.968 --> 00:08:07.200]  Well, that's why it's such a risk what they're producing is another potential deadly AIDS, HIV, because they're injecting live reverse-engineered viruses in the flu vaccines with all these recombinants in it.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.242]  And basically it's literally a witch's brew.
[00:08:10.503 --> 00:08:11.283]  I'm going to stop you.
[00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:11.944]  I'm going to stop you.
[00:08:11.964 --> 00:08:14.046]  Then I'm going to sit back and I want you to have the floor Dr. Horowitz.
[00:08:14.066 --> 00:08:15.527]  We'll go to break and we'll come back to Sherry.
[00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:18.349]  But I don't want to just glaze over this massive announcement.
[00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.234]  It is confirmed that they're growing it in the monkey kidneys.
[00:08:23.714 --> 00:08:29.219]  It's confirmed those monkeys carry virulent virus that they admit has killed tens of millions worldwide.
[00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:30.079]  Government admits that.
[00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:34.824]  The SV40, simian cancer virus.
[00:08:35.524 --> 00:08:39.026]  And that it's in there, and this is massive news.
[00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:40.487]  It's in the German and British news.
[00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:41.667]  You'll never hear it here.
[00:08:42.968 --> 00:08:44.529]  Explain to people what SV40 does.
[00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:45.149]  Go ahead.
[00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.552]  Simian Virus 40 is the 40th monkey virus ever discovered.
[00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:52.633]  It was actually stolen by Dr. Maurice Hilleman.
[00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:55.175]  On YouTube you can actually...
[00:08:56.323 --> 00:09:13.437]  Here's a segment I put up several months ago where Hillerman, Merck Sharpen Domes, Merck Pharmaceutical Company's chief vaccine developer admits bringing the AIDS virus into North America in these monkeys that are currently being used by Baxter to produce the flu vaccine.
[00:09:13.457 --> 00:09:14.297]  And he laughs!
[00:09:14.377 --> 00:09:15.098]  It's very funny.
[00:09:15.758 --> 00:09:16.399]  Yeah, it's sick.
[00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:18.200]  It's actually on YouTube.
[00:09:18.821 --> 00:09:19.261]  Check it out.
[00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:23.805]  Merck, chief vaccine chief, brings AIDS to the world.
[00:09:24.888 --> 00:09:39.723]  And so what you're looking at is SP40, and I have a publication in Journal of Medical Hypotheses that goes into detail about how the hepatitis B vaccines, as well as the polio vaccines, were contaminated.
[00:09:40.324 --> 00:09:46.310]  And that this is what, according to all the scientific evidence, brought HIV AIDS to the world.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:57.682]  Now, what they're currently doing, another breaking news is that number one man in the United States on HIV AIDS, he's the AIDS czar for America.
[00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:00.203]  His name is Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[00:10:00.923 --> 00:10:09.445]  He's the co-patent holder on Interleukin-2, which is another adjuvant additive in this vaccine.
[00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:12.586]  So what you're looking at is Interleukin-2
[00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:33.181]  And it's relationship to boosting and actually manipulating the human immune system, combining that with the non-oxal 9, in essence this adjuvant is preparing the population to be infected with HIV-like viruses.
[00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:37.584]  So it's a soft kill preparation?
[00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:46.794]  It's actually, it is another mutation of HIV for immune suppression and human population reduction.
[00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:59.086]  Well, I mean, I'm no doctor, Dr. Horowitz, but the interleukin you mentioned, I've read about that as one of the dangerous HIV drugs they were forcing on New York foster children and killing them with it.
[00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.957]  You're absolutely right, and the most recent studies are that they're not helpful.
[00:11:05.358 --> 00:11:10.727]  They've tested them in thousands of HIV AIDS patients over long periods of time.
[00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:16.833]  So basically, I've read the studies about cancer being associated with an over
[00:11:39.545 --> 00:11:42.747]  Overly active immune system and finally just burns out, gives up.
[00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:45.409]  My God, this is so diabolical.
[00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:55.795]  And it goes back to New York City with the big Rockefeller Foundation that discovered the cancer viruses and pushed it, that controls the big medical trust that you and your affidavit are saying is running this whole operation.
[00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:56.636]  Stay there.
[00:11:56.676 --> 00:11:58.937]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz and Sherry Cain.
[00:11:58.978 --> 00:11:59.418]  Stay with us.
[00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:03.275]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:12:03.855 --> 00:12:06.536]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:10.698]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:20.443]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:22.664]  Rely instead on OxySilver.
[00:12:22.984 --> 00:12:28.407]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:12:28.687 --> 00:12:33.492]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:12:34.132 --> 00:12:38.837]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:41.940]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.704]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:12:47.745 --> 00:12:50.567]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:53.950]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.572]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:12:57.033 --> 00:12:58.414]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:12:58.654 --> 00:13:00.075]  This call could save your life.
[00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:07.001]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:14.487]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:15.043 --> 00:13:21.228]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:23.469]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:26.031]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:37.039]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.981]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:40.722]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:47.527]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:55.914]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:56.394 --> 00:13:57.535]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:57.956 --> 00:13:59.137]  The people strike back.
[00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.991]  Good day.
[00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:03.752]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:04.293]  September 22, 2009.
[00:14:04.353 --> 00:14:05.494]  Gold opened this morning at $1,016.10.
[00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:09.398]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1,044.58, $522.29 for a half-ounce, or $261.15 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:09.919]  That's $1,044.58, $522.29, and $261.15.
[00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:26.477]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources with an exciting announcement.
[00:14:26.837 --> 00:14:40.586]  Friday, September 25th at 7 p.m., two of the most influential representatives in Congress, Ron Paul and Michelle Bachman, are putting on the Student Town Hall Meeting, free to the public, at Northrop Auditorium University Campus.
[00:14:40.866 --> 00:14:46.290]  The topics of this rare event will be monetary reform, limited government, and free market economy.
[00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.151]  Don't miss this powerful gathering.
[00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:52.637]  Again, dates for this event is Friday, September 25th at 7 p.m.
[00:14:52.757 --> 00:14:58.705]  Northrop U of M campus or go to www.mitusresources.com for more information.
[00:15:01.078 --> 00:15:07.925]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graff Hunter safes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[00:15:08.025 --> 00:15:10.608]  Graff Hunter safes are known as the Rolls Royce of safes.
[00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:15.353]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:19.938]  Whether it's a custom fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[00:15:20.038 --> 00:15:21.920]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.541]  We're good to go!
[00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:23.021]  We're good to go!
[00:15:41.476 --> 00:15:43.617]  The five companies putting out the H1N1 flu vaccine.
[00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:09.957]  No!
[00:16:10.257 --> 00:16:19.580]  The Army admits that the adjuvants that were very similar to this, put in the anthrax shot for the troops, killed a bunch of people and maimed thousands.
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.740]  That's on record!
[00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:33.484]  Dr. Horowitz, am I right in saying, and also Sherry Kane, from your research, that they are fully conscious of what they're doing, A, and B then, what is the master plan?
[00:16:33.544 --> 00:16:34.804]  What is the point of all of this?
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:48.126]  The actual adjuvants in the squalene that are included, there's no doubt that the scientific literature slam dunks the contraindications of these.
[00:16:48.606 --> 00:16:54.910]  You really, again, have the scientific agenda that says that this is more toxic than healthful.
[00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:07.698]  And, you know, it's kind of like the same scam of how the concentration camp victims were lulled into believing they were actually going to go in to take a shower for public health.
[00:17:08.306 --> 00:17:09.406]  And disinfection.
[00:17:09.827 --> 00:17:24.351]  Here we're allegedly adding squalene adjuvant to reduce risk of vaccinations and increase efficacy of vaccinations and that the science is actually the opposite.
[00:17:25.132 --> 00:17:31.614]  And I think what the agenda is, again my concern about this is, and again there's a
[00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:48.156]  A good researcher out there, William Alec, Bill Alec, who likewise confirmed yesterday after our show, Alex, that the most likely scenario is because there's such an incredible amount of investment in this scam.
[00:17:48.931 --> 00:18:03.795]  That the authorities are likely to release something or do something that is going to compel the expenditures and the use of the stockpiled vaccinations so that even that they would save face.
[00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:08.316]  I mean, you just mentioned a couple minutes ago that there's really nothing happening.
[00:18:09.374 --> 00:18:18.442]  And, you know, they've hyped us all up, and they've spent these billions and billions of dollars to prepare us, and what's the likelihood?
[00:18:18.642 --> 00:18:20.463]  Is this just going to just go away?
[00:18:20.483 --> 00:18:22.585]  I don't think so.
[00:18:22.885 --> 00:18:23.946]  It's not likely.
[00:18:24.326 --> 00:18:37.197]  The more likely scenario is, I mean, I pray it will go away, I pray that nothing will happen, and I pray that the government would simply cease and desist based on the several litigations that have been filed, even in the United States now.
[00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:39.926]  Well, Dr. Horowitz, look at the political landscape.
[00:18:40.426 --> 00:18:46.049]  Even Dick Armey has said he thinks Obama's using this hype to pass his eugenics healthcare.
[00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.010]  They need their new Bank of the World.
[00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.192]  Everything legislatively is coming up in the fall and winter.
[00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:53.073]  This is a perfect cover.
[00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:56.034]  And we know they're suddenly putting troops on the streets everywhere.
[00:18:56.334 --> 00:19:02.738]  The news reports are coming in, the amateur videos are coming in of Marines and Army searching people randomly.
[00:19:03.478 --> 00:19:07.400]  They're now medicalizing the police under federal grants to take citizens' blood.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.523]  I mean, they're definitely built up to show that this isn't just some tabletop drill.
[00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:15.464]  Right, and you know, you look at the Wizard of Oz.
[00:19:15.484 --> 00:19:16.785]  Who's pulling the strings?
[00:19:17.265 --> 00:19:19.106]  And you know, Sherry Kane can comment.
[00:19:19.656 --> 00:19:22.438]  Basically, Steve Byrd, he's in bed with all of these other
[00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:47.260]  Pharmaceutical companies, and they are all on the same campaign together to get their message out.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:55.902]  I mean, you know, I want to go back to what Dr. Horowitz said about, you know, World War II.
[00:19:56.242 --> 00:20:02.903]  I mean, one of Hitler's most famous quotes was, make the lie big, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.
[00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:05.683]  So, I mean, this is part of what they're trying to do.
[00:20:05.703 --> 00:20:10.044]  They're brainwashing people into believing that there's this mass
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.361]  I think so.
[00:20:19.691 --> 00:20:20.731]  They're all pulling the strings.
[00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:28.293]  I actually am doing research, and so is Dr. Horowitz, on Rupert Murdoch, who is on the board.
[00:20:28.373 --> 00:20:32.374]  He's one of the top heads of the Partnership for New York City.
[00:20:32.955 --> 00:20:37.816]  And if you check out Partnership for New York City, you can link all the people on there.
[00:20:37.856 --> 00:20:39.036]  It's like a Who's Who.
[00:20:40.056 --> 00:20:45.578]  You'll see that there's people like Thomas Glosser, who is the
[00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:48.794]  The CEO, the director of Reuters.
[00:20:49.094 --> 00:20:50.575]  I mean, we know Reuters, right?
[00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:51.535]  The wire service.
[00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:54.776]  This guy is also the director of Merck Pharmaceuticals.
[00:20:55.317 --> 00:21:05.221]  I mean, the same person that's out there controlling what we say is the same person that is manufacturing these viruses and these vaccinations.
[00:21:05.686 --> 00:21:09.969]  And by the way, Sherry, did you see the Reuters article on September 16th?
[00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:12.770]  Flu experts gear up for pandemic vaccine worry.
[00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:15.552]  And they say, look, millions are going to die.
[00:21:15.992 --> 00:21:18.654]  They're going to think it was from the vaccine, but it's not.
[00:21:19.014 --> 00:21:20.815]  It's a mass diagnosis that
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.750]  Let me read it.
[00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:26.373]  One million heart attacks, 700,000 strokes, and 900,000 miscarriages.
[00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:27.113]  U.S.
[00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:32.477]  public health officials want Americans to know these will happen every year with or without the swine flu vaccine campaign.
[00:21:32.817 --> 00:21:39.882]  Yet this year, they know a significant number will be blamed on the H1N1 vaccine, which will roll out within weeks, and they are struggling to be ready.
[00:21:41.043 --> 00:21:43.445]  So when we come back in the long segment coming up,
[00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:51.853]  I want you both to comment on this because they're saying, look, a lot of people will take the shot, a lot of people will die, but it's not the shot.
[00:21:51.873 --> 00:21:54.755]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:58.377]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.564 --> 00:22:04.165]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:04.565 --> 00:22:09.527]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:09.887 --> 00:22:11.627]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:11.948 --> 00:22:16.749]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:16.949 --> 00:22:17.890]  How much do you want?
[00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.850]  When do you want it?
[00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.852]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:21.953]  When will you need it?
[00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:24.276]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:24.396 --> 00:22:25.517]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:25.737 --> 00:22:27.078]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:32.344]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:32.544 --> 00:22:35.728]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:36.128 --> 00:22:39.592]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:39.932 --> 00:22:40.913]  How much will you need?
[00:22:41.153 --> 00:22:41.774]  We don't know.
[00:22:42.074 --> 00:22:42.975]  How much do you want?
[00:22:43.176 --> 00:22:43.896]  All you can get.
[00:22:44.097 --> 00:22:44.958]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.961]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:50.003]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:22:50.043 --> 00:22:50.944]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.727]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:05.887 --> 00:23:10.233]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:10.393 --> 00:23:12.256]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:12.676 --> 00:23:14.038]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:14.298 --> 00:23:15.340]  There is a solution.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:23.586]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:23:37.497 --> 00:23:43.082]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:24:01.455 --> 00:24:07.860]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.882]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:24:11.036 --> 00:24:11.877]  Who is the enemy?
[00:24:12.397 --> 00:24:12.897]  Bin Laden.
[00:24:13.177 --> 00:24:14.178]  This is his M.O.
[00:24:14.198 --> 00:24:15.499]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:17.200]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:24.304]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:25.144]  Some U.S.
[00:24:25.184 --> 00:24:30.828]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:24:31.528 --> 00:24:35.029]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:38.069]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:25.510]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz and investigative journalist Sherry Cain join us right now.
[00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:32.416]  You can go to Fluscam.com to see the affidavit and see all the other research that Dr. Horowitz has.
[00:25:32.436 --> 00:25:34.858]  We're going to go back to them in just one moment.
[00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:38.481]  I did want to tell all the TV viewers that I consulted on this film.
[00:25:39.302 --> 00:25:41.444]  I am one of the main featured people in the film.
[00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:48.150]  So my detailed research on the FEMA camps, where they are, how they're run, how they're rolling out the military, NORTHCOM,
[00:25:49.554 --> 00:25:56.985]  How they use sports stadiums under Operation Top Off and their tabletop exercises in NLE 09.
[00:25:57.525 --> 00:26:02.612]  This is really a film I'm proud that I'm in and I'm really proud of the job they did.
[00:26:02.933 --> 00:26:06.157]  For anybody that wants to know the truth about concentration camps in America.
[00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:15.587]  And how they want to use pandemics and other excuses to roll it out and condition everybody to accept that Camp FEMA, American Lockdown, is the film, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:17.809]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:21.032]  You can also get some of my other films at half price when you get them with
[00:26:21.673 --> 00:26:22.374]  Camp FEMA.
[00:26:23.174 --> 00:26:25.536]  And it is just an amazing documentary.
[00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:30.241]  I hope everyone will visit InfoWars.com and order the DVD.
[00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:31.862]  We've been shipping it out since last week.
[00:26:32.162 --> 00:26:33.083]  We even got it first.
[00:26:33.123 --> 00:26:34.364]  We're shipping it before anybody.
[00:26:35.205 --> 00:26:36.686]  And these are sold out in many other places.
[00:26:36.726 --> 00:26:37.587]  We happen to have them.
[00:26:37.947 --> 00:26:43.993]  So again, Camp FEMA American Lockdown that I consulted on and I feature massively in.
[00:26:44.413 --> 00:26:48.397]  Just an amazing job by William Lewis and Gary Franchi.
[00:26:49.137 --> 00:26:51.339]  And, uh, will we end up in these camps?
[00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.820]  See what the experts have to say.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.085]  Camp FEMA boasts an all-star lineup of guests who have dedicated their lives, sacred honor, and fortunes to upholding the U.S.
[00:26:58.125 --> 00:26:58.745]  Constitution.
[00:26:59.045 --> 00:27:00.827]  The evidence is strong and their warnings are clear.
[00:27:01.107 --> 00:27:04.530]  Camp FEMA, available at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore.
[00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.391]  You can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:08.173]  Or you can, again, also write to us.
[00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:08.333]  It's 1995.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.240]  P.O.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.001]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:24.222]  Again, that's Infowars.com, P.O.
[00:27:24.242 --> 00:27:27.162]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:27:28.562 --> 00:27:38.304]  Camp FEMA, Endgame, Terror Storm, The Obama Deception, books, videos, all the best stuff I've seen out there, not just my films are there.
[00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:40.105]  We also are now carrying
[00:27:40.805 --> 00:27:51.273]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny's book, Foul, Revised and Updated, Bird Flu, It's Not Just What You Think, goes along the same line as the Swine Flu, Understanding the Police State, What the Vaccines Really Do.
[00:27:51.553 --> 00:27:53.855]  That's available at InfoWars.com as well.
[00:27:53.895 --> 00:27:55.696]  And she's joining us, by the way, on Thursday.
[00:27:55.756 --> 00:27:57.117]  Dr. Ron Paul is also on.
[00:27:57.477 --> 00:28:01.260]  I want to get back with Ms.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.322]  Cain and Dr. Horowitz here in just a moment.
[00:28:03.342 --> 00:28:04.623]  But first, Dr. Horowitz,
[00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:15.366]  You have tetrahedron.org, you have other sites, and you have researched this, and you have also a lot of fact sheets and other things about how to get your immune system up, how to protect your body.
[00:28:15.666 --> 00:28:18.727]  Tell us the best site to learn about your books, your films, your materials.
[00:28:19.707 --> 00:28:28.510]  Well, the best preventative that I recommend is oxysilver.com, and the best place to order it is online at 888-508-7000.
[00:28:32.655 --> 00:28:41.500]  4787.
[00:28:33.456 --> 00:28:41.500]  I'm sorry, for people who are not on the internet, they can call toll-free 888-508-4787.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.981]  I don't worry personally.
[00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:46.883]  My family doesn't worry about the flu because we are covered by OxySilver.
[00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:53.126]  I urge people to learn about it because it's not just even a top-rated silver hydrosol.
[00:28:53.186 --> 00:28:54.187]  It goes way beyond.
[00:28:54.227 --> 00:28:56.888]  It takes people into, and actually the first
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:06.013]  Nutraceutical that actually brings you into the understanding of bioenergetics for protection which is where we really should be going.
[00:29:06.414 --> 00:29:12.704]  And I'm going to have you back up in the next week specifically on that so people can go to Fluscam.com and find that.
[00:29:13.598 --> 00:29:16.302]  Yeah, Poliscam.com has links to OxySilver.
[00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:18.705]  Also, the affidavit, like you mentioned, is on there.
[00:29:19.106 --> 00:29:21.429]  There's a tremendous amount of information.
[00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.854]  There's counterintelligence propaganda flying everywhere.
[00:29:24.894 --> 00:29:27.577]  The National Vaccine Information Center... Yeah, let's stop right there.
[00:29:28.098 --> 00:29:29.300]  That's a good next question.
[00:29:31.064 --> 00:29:32.665]  You're believing they're going to release something.
[00:29:32.725 --> 00:29:37.509]  Finish up with that, and then let's get into their counter-propaganda, their lies.
[00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:43.533]  I see them on the news saying there's no mercury in it, even when they admit down in the article that there is the Marisol.
[00:29:43.933 --> 00:29:46.075]  I see them saying there's not an adjuvant in there.
[00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:49.277]  I see them just engaged in unbelievable propaganda.
[00:29:50.146 --> 00:29:58.433]  Okay, now you mentioned earlier on, and I applaud you and Charlie Sheen for putting this into the release that you guys did on 9-11.
[00:29:58.934 --> 00:30:03.057]  You know, remember they said they already reported Building 7 was pulled before it was pulled?
[00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:03.718]  Yes.
[00:30:04.218 --> 00:30:05.740]  Now this is the same kind of thing.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:10.183]  They're reporting that this is going to be a horrific thing before it's a horrific thing.
[00:30:10.984 --> 00:30:13.006]  And they're actually, if you look at
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:13.980]  Ms.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:22.107]  Cain's research and my research into the Partnership for New York City, and you have the Rockefeller link to the royalty of Europe.
[00:30:22.207 --> 00:30:26.651]  Literally, this organization was chartered by the royal family of England.
[00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:34.398]  When you understand the Rockefellers are behind everything from New York City Blood Council that put together the New York City Blood Bank,
[00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:35.279]  We're good.
[00:30:50.702 --> 00:30:52.963]  Again, these are on-record mass killers.
[00:30:53.003 --> 00:30:56.865]  They were convicted of that in French courts and didn't even get in trouble worldwide.
[00:30:56.905 --> 00:31:04.108]  It came out in the court documents that Bayer especially knew for ten years it was in the Factor VIII and shipped it out to millions.
[00:31:04.148 --> 00:31:11.971]  I mean, they are, again, the history these people have of doing this over and over again, and then we're the weirdos for not trusting them.
[00:31:12.511 --> 00:31:12.791]  Right.
[00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:15.132]  So this is why I'm very concerned.
[00:31:15.252 --> 00:31:19.134]  I mean, honestly, I think that these people's backs are up against the wall.
[00:31:19.784 --> 00:31:24.447]  We've been out there successfully now persuading the public to open their eyes.
[00:31:24.887 --> 00:31:28.429]  And so they're really now stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[00:31:28.749 --> 00:31:31.131]  They've got to, in essence, produce a pandemic.
[00:31:31.371 --> 00:31:34.233]  They've got to show us that they were right all along.
[00:31:34.473 --> 00:31:36.174]  And that's what I'm mostly frightened about.
[00:31:38.537 --> 00:32:05.488]  Now, you spoke yesterday, and I want to get you to comment on this, and then Sherry, that, and this is in the UN press releases, we've covered it, it was in documents three months ago, and four months ago, and this really got going in April, that they have these virus simulants, and they use other terms that are really viruses, that they say they released to prepare people's immunity, and then they just kind of announced this huge issue like it's no big deal.
[00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:21.053]  Yeah, that was confirmed a couple weeks ago by the World Health Organization when the propaganda became thick and heavy because they realized that the physicians already, over 50% of the doctors are not going to take it, nor are they going to prescribe it for their patients.
[00:32:21.614 --> 00:32:35.818]  So when they needed to promote this flu vaccine, the World Health Organization issued a statement wherein they actually reinforced what I had already reported with you on this show, whereby we said that Dr. James Robertson
[00:32:36.576 --> 00:33:03.711]  The World Health Organization Director for Influenza, who was in charge of selecting the viruses for the vaccination companies, and that this doctor and Dr. Woods, who he works with, came out and actually said that we're going to release in advance, we're going to feed the population with viruses to allegedly, they say, enhance our immunity against the pandemic that's forthcoming.
[00:33:04.426 --> 00:33:19.760]  So, that's what we reported with you, Alex, was that the Mexican flu outbreak was most likely the seeding, and that this now transition as the virus is going from America to Asia and then to Europe, the Euro-Asia connection.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:26.766]  Now you've got Baxter, the most untrustworthy company in the field of pharmaceuticals.
[00:33:27.421 --> 00:33:41.512]  It's actually spreading HIV, I'm sorry, spreading avian flu, H5N1, in their H1N1 vaccinations to 18 European laboratories and they say it's an accident.
[00:33:42.033 --> 00:33:50.480]  At the same time, you've got a train that somehow there's an accident in a laboratory, vials blow up inside a box.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.261]  I mean, it's a ridiculous accident.
[00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:54.029]  On a train.
[00:33:54.329 --> 00:33:59.734]  And remember, this is Baxter with Bayer, knowingly shipping out the AIDS product.
[00:34:00.074 --> 00:34:00.434]  Right.
[00:34:00.495 --> 00:34:01.896]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:34:02.436 --> 00:34:03.597]  It's unbelievable.
[00:34:03.858 --> 00:34:06.440]  And there's no mention of this on the mainstream.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.883]  So we're really looking at, absolutely, with the more
[00:34:10.243 --> 00:34:11.284]  The new affidavit.
[00:34:11.324 --> 00:34:13.826]  With the affidavit, you've got the definitive proof.
[00:34:13.846 --> 00:34:33.319]  You've got all the links that show you that the Rockefeller Trust, from the partnerships of New York City, is intimately engaged in not only the deception through the mainstream media, but actually engaged in the vaccination, intoxication, and the dissemination of these hideously toxic vaccines.
[00:34:35.734 --> 00:34:41.515]  Now I want to go back to something and I want to get your take on it and then Sherry's take on this.
[00:34:41.995 --> 00:34:51.817]  We have confirmed, this is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we're getting more and more of these every hour coming in from Texas and New York and Illinois.
[00:34:52.337 --> 00:34:58.538]  Healthcare workers, school teachers, people that run daycares, daycare workers, police.
[00:34:59.038 --> 00:35:04.639]  They're being called in and they're told, you've got to take the regular flu shot, and many of them in the last two weeks have already been forced to do it.
[00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:06.181]  Through color of law.
[00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:07.763]  They're told it's a new regulation.
[00:35:07.824 --> 00:35:08.765]  The Fed said we have to.
[00:35:08.805 --> 00:35:09.687]  They don't show them any law.
[00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.630]  They say we're under level six.
[00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:16.684]  And they say, don't tell anyone we made you do this.
[00:35:16.724 --> 00:35:18.045]  I mean, how criminal is that?
[00:35:18.105 --> 00:35:22.429]  How obviously underhanded and stinking to high heaven is that?
[00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:24.331]  And we now have these documents.
[00:35:24.451 --> 00:35:27.173]  In fact, we'll go to InfoWars and punch it up on screen.
[00:35:28.374 --> 00:35:32.878]  It's got the document posted, the article, Home Healthcare Workers in New York Required to Get Vaccinated.
[00:35:32.898 --> 00:35:34.279]  That's on the main page of InfoWars.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.383]  You click on it and here's the letter where they're told, you take this or you're fired.
[00:35:38.683 --> 00:35:40.345]  So Obama's saying you don't have to take it,
[00:35:40.745 --> 00:35:49.528]  But quietly they're testing to see if they can force the medical workers and police to do it, because if they can force them, then they can try to force the general public.
[00:35:50.628 --> 00:36:04.153]  Yeah, my greatest urging right now is for all the attorneys who have a heart for humanity to advance the temporary restraining orders based on the evidence that we have on the vaccine adjuvants.
[00:36:04.713 --> 00:36:09.735]  That alone, the toxicity and the science and the documentation, even congressional records,
[00:36:10.533 --> 00:36:16.755]  Is enough to say, hey, courts and judges, please stop this right now.
[00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:21.796]  And I really am not seeing a lot of heroic attorneys come forward.
[00:36:22.217 --> 00:36:33.440]  And the ones that I believe are heroic, I just watch them stalling and stammering and debating whether or not they should do X, Y, Z. Gee whiz, we're running out of time.
[00:36:34.181 --> 00:36:42.667]  Well, even if you're for taking all these poisons from Baxter and Bayer, who knowingly ship out HIV-filled Factor VIII, killing people en masse on record.
[00:36:42.687 --> 00:36:44.869]  I mean, we can pull up the MSNBC report.
[00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:46.430]  I mean, this is not us just saying this.
[00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.793]  I wouldn't dare come out and just say that about Bayer or Baxter if it wasn't in the news.
[00:36:51.253 --> 00:36:52.774]  I get emails saying I'm making it up.
[00:36:52.914 --> 00:37:03.502]  No, these companies admittedly do this, and then now we're going to trust their vaccine that the squalene alone, the Army admits they suspended the Anthrax campaign because it was killing the troops!
[00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:07.923]  Right, and it's more concentrated in this, according to the reports that I've been reading.
[00:37:08.924 --> 00:37:21.591]  And Alex, I also want to add that Baxter is in partnership with CSL, which is basically the Australian pharmaceutical company that is connected with Rupert Murdoch's Research Institute.
[00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:30.937]  That's Murdoch Children's Research Institute that is actually conducting swine flu trials on babies and children up to 8 years old.
[00:37:31.137 --> 00:37:32.038]  And pregnant women.
[00:37:33.673 --> 00:37:34.154]  I think
[00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:56.927]  Well, these companies connect back to New York, because I had the doctors involved who were in the prisons.
[00:37:57.748 --> 00:38:10.896]  I remember back in the late 80s, they banned prisoners giving blood, but in Arkansas, Clinton would ship it out to New York, then to Toronto, and then to these companies filled with HIV, people they knew had AIDS and Hepatitis were allowed to give.
[00:38:11.857 --> 00:38:13.918]  They do this because they're eugenicists.
[00:38:14.658 --> 00:38:15.459]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:20.582]  And again, I want to reinforce the American Red Double Cross.
[00:38:21.164 --> 00:38:21.404]  This is just...
[00:38:50.609 --> 00:38:55.451]  Hard to deal with, knowing the facts, and seeing how diabolical this is.
[00:38:56.712 --> 00:39:05.215]  Dr. Horowitz, from studying how they've done things in the past, you predicted the anthrax attack successfully with total precision, instead of what would be through the mail because you saw their studies on it.
[00:39:06.216 --> 00:39:12.999]  Looking at other studies they've done with dark winter and other flu pandemic scenarios for martial law lockdowns,
[00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:19.106]  How do you and your crystal ball see them releasing something?
[00:39:19.768 --> 00:39:20.769]  What areas of the country?
[00:39:20.849 --> 00:39:21.671]  How would they do it?
[00:39:22.051 --> 00:39:27.581]  What should police that are waking up, that are compartmentalized, what should they be on the lookout for?
[00:39:28.444 --> 00:39:41.488]  Well, I think Los Angeles is the highest likely place that a central intelligence agency, because Rockefeller controls CIA, and CIA is on top of all the infectious disease organizations.
[00:39:41.728 --> 00:39:43.708]  That's according to their own documentation.
[00:39:43.988 --> 00:39:52.531]  They see infectious disease as a national security risk, so CIA oversees NIAID, Dr. Fauci, he's a puppet of CIA.
[00:39:53.451 --> 00:40:22.770]  So, we're looking at, if you read the book Death in the Air, Globalism, Terrorism, and Toxic Warfare, like I said yesterday on the show, I came out with the title long before September 11th, and you think about death in the air, globalism, terrorism, toxic warfare, very few people were talking about that back then, and evergreen helicopters, and the covert operations, the fronts for the CIA that are operating the aircraft
[00:40:23.374 --> 00:40:31.960]  It could either be spraying, they could easily redo what they did in the New York subway systems and in the tunnels of Pennsylvania Turnpike.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:41.266]  Years ago, the United States Congress investigated CIA wrongdoing involved in spreading biological weapons over San Francisco.
[00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:42.727]  They could do the same thing.
[00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:45.969]  New York subway, deaths resulted, details remain classified, 1968.
[00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:47.761]  Right.
[00:40:48.322 --> 00:40:48.882]  Exactly.
[00:40:49.102 --> 00:41:11.596]  So, these are their capabilities, and again, I believe they're stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I believe that, you know, because we're all waking up, and I believe that, just like you shared with the pre-announcement that Building 7 was already coming down in Europe, that's again, Thomas Glosier runs Reuters, intimately connected to the drug industry.
[00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:14.498]  And it was Reuters, I want to just stop you, it was Reuters.
[00:41:14.658 --> 00:41:15.359]  At first,
[00:41:16.317 --> 00:41:20.499]  Two BBC channels simultaneously reported the exact same text.
[00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:29.282]  Their news reporters reading off teleprompters said, Solomon Brothers Building 7, 47-story building, has fallen completely from fires into its own footprint.
[00:41:29.882 --> 00:41:32.583]  And then the firefighters are all standing there, and then they hear the countdown.
[00:41:32.603 --> 00:41:35.364]  25 minutes later, they're told, get back, we're bringing it down.
[00:41:35.404 --> 00:41:38.445]  This is on CNN video as they're running, and then it blows up.
[00:41:39.662 --> 00:41:42.623]  And then BBC said, no, you don't have that video.
[00:41:42.683 --> 00:41:43.724]  No, we lost the video.
[00:41:43.764 --> 00:41:44.524]  No, it isn't real.
[00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:49.947]  Then they made a TV show on BBC last year admitting, OK, we just screwed up.
[00:41:50.487 --> 00:42:00.511]  And then the reporter admitted on the BBC News article they wrote, the editor of the BBC, of BBC News, admitted Reuters, quote, screwed up.
[00:42:01.192 --> 00:42:08.735]  And an hour before gave us an internal news brief that Building 7 had fallen with how it actually fell.
[00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:13.359]  Okay, that's like saying somebody's going to have a heart attack in an hour who's walking along healthy.
[00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.800]  Police are going to come back to you and say, did you poison them?
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:21.502]  How did you know that Bob, who was 45 and in perfect health, sitting at a park bench, was going to die in an hour?
[00:42:21.522 --> 00:42:22.963]  They had a crystal ball, Alex.
[00:42:23.223 --> 00:42:25.884]  They had a real crystal ball, and then it came out.
[00:42:26.424 --> 00:42:26.964]  Reuters!
[00:42:26.984 --> 00:42:28.765]  I don't know if you knew this, doctor, but you just brought it up.
[00:42:29.225 --> 00:42:33.607]  But we discovered Reuters was the one that sent that to BBC.
[00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:51.532]  Yeah, and that, look it also, before anybody knew anything about this H1N1, Reuters reported that it was a combination of avian, swine, and Spanish flu viruses that now they agree that the scientists agree.
[00:42:51.792 --> 00:42:55.635]  How did they know that that early on, and how come they reported that?
[00:42:55.855 --> 00:42:59.739]  And then when you just consider that... Then it turns out they had patents years before.
[00:42:59.759 --> 00:43:00.079]  Stay there.
[00:43:01.741 --> 00:43:03.602]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:43:03.722 --> 00:43:10.426]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:43:10.686 --> 00:43:18.871]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:43:19.091 --> 00:43:24.814]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:43:24.994 --> 00:43:26.776]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:43:26.816 --> 00:43:28.978]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:43:28.998 --> 00:43:33.362]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:43:33.542 --> 00:43:35.684]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:03.390]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.911]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:08.052]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:44:08.192 --> 00:44:09.733]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:44:09.793 --> 00:44:11.393]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:44:11.453 --> 00:44:14.295]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:44:14.315 --> 00:44:18.056]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:44:18.136 --> 00:44:19.797]  Do you listen, huh?
[00:44:27.657 --> 00:44:32.512]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:44:36.315 --> 00:44:40.136]  How dare you?
[00:44:40.396 --> 00:44:43.817]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:44:43.837 --> 00:44:46.357]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:44:46.558 --> 00:44:53.139]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:46:18.618 --> 00:46:26.038]  They're going to destroy us!
[00:46:31.767 --> 00:46:32.827]  We don't stand up to them.
[00:46:33.787 --> 00:46:37.248]  We're going back to Dr. Lynn Horowitz and Sherry Cain here in a moment.
[00:46:37.268 --> 00:46:39.148]  They'll be with us 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:46:39.649 --> 00:46:42.589]  Then I'm going to cover the CPS coming out of people's kids for no reason.
[00:46:42.609 --> 00:46:49.411]  15 million dollar fines for garage sales if you have any even 10 year old recalled product having no idea what you're selling.
[00:46:50.331 --> 00:46:51.291]  That's all coming up.
[00:46:51.411 --> 00:46:56.532]  A bunch of global government economic news is coming up as well today.
[00:46:58.968 --> 00:47:02.369]  And we're going to open the phones up in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:02.629 --> 00:47:09.950]  If you're a nurse, if you're a doctor, if you're a police officer, if you're a medical worker, that's what the lines are for.
[00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:16.272]  Only for those calls or from people who've been ordered to take shots or have had them pushed on them at school or work.
[00:47:17.252 --> 00:47:21.133]  Anybody who's been a part of these military checkpoints that are popping up, that's coming up in the next hour.

[00:47:25.712 --> 00:47:29.094]  You can also call our hotline here in my studios, not just the Minnesota studios.
[00:47:29.114 --> 00:47:29.154]  888-201-2244.
[00:47:29.174 --> 00:47:29.314]  888-201-2244.
[00:47:29.554 --> 00:47:31.776]  We're going back to Dr. Horowitz here in just a minute.
[00:47:36.522 --> 00:47:41.184]  I did want to let you know about some of the sponsors that make this radio show possible, briefly.
[00:47:41.664 --> 00:47:42.885]  One of them is eFoods Direct.
[00:47:42.925 --> 00:47:49.368]  Look, in these insane economic and biological times and all the things that are happening, I believe in storable foods.
[00:47:49.768 --> 00:47:55.050]  These last more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years guaranteed if it's in your garage like mine is.
[00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:55.971]  I don't have room in my house.
[00:47:56.571 --> 00:47:57.732]  I've got a three-year supply.
[00:47:58.672 --> 00:47:59.513]  For my entire family.
[00:47:59.994 --> 00:48:01.175]  And I bought other storable foods.
[00:48:01.195 --> 00:48:02.597]  Didn't like the quality or they were old.
[00:48:02.637 --> 00:48:04.939]  These are non-GMO, non-hybrid, freshly packed.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.482]  Everything but the bananas is grown right here in the U.S.
[00:48:08.083 --> 00:48:09.385]  This stuff is packed every month.
[00:48:09.605 --> 00:48:10.846]  Biggest outfit out there.
[00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:12.228]  Longest continually operating.
[00:48:12.628 --> 00:48:13.950]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:15.992]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread. 888...
[00:48:18.274 --> 00:48:18.354]  409-5633.
[00:48:18.415 --> 00:48:20.736]  Give eFoodsDirect a call.
[00:48:20.796 --> 00:48:23.918]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:48:23.938 --> 00:48:24.198]  888-409-5633.
[00:48:24.698 --> 00:48:28.080]  Or check them out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.143]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:32.263 --> 00:48:34.004]  Also, Diginet.net.
[00:48:34.424 --> 00:48:38.867]  I noticed we were sent a video of National Guard running an illegal checkpoint in Arizona with the police.
[00:48:39.527 --> 00:48:41.168]  Somebody shot on the Diginet.net pin.
[00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:45.071]  Very inexpensive, high quality, solid state.
[00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:47.073]  Press one button, it records audio and video.
[00:48:47.413 --> 00:48:52.358]  They've got sunglasses that have a tiny camera and little chip in them that are awesome.
[00:48:52.498 --> 00:48:53.518]  In fact, we've got some of these.
[00:48:53.739 --> 00:48:58.203]  Don't let the guys forget not to take these to the G20 that's coming up because
[00:48:59.735 --> 00:49:01.756]  Well, they got 2,000 troops on the ground in Pittsburgh.
[00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:02.897]  I'm sending three guys up there.
[00:49:02.937 --> 00:49:04.818]  Burmese is going, too, and Douglas.
[00:49:05.218 --> 00:49:06.119]  Anyway, side issue.
[00:49:06.199 --> 00:49:08.961]  The point is, diginet.net, diginet.net.
[00:49:09.001 --> 00:49:10.982]  Have something that's going to be a record in court.
[00:49:11.102 --> 00:49:11.562]  Anything.
[00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:13.203]  Great for journalists.
[00:49:13.243 --> 00:49:14.584]  Great for people stopped by the police.
[00:49:14.664 --> 00:49:15.705]  Diginet.net.
[00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:16.525]  That's diginet.net.
[00:49:18.166 --> 00:49:25.811]  Ladies and gentlemen, give them a call at 888-344-6681, 888-344-6681, diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:28.893]  Now we're about to go to break.
[00:49:28.913 --> 00:49:29.854]  That was a short segment.
[00:49:29.874 --> 00:49:41.121]  We're going to come back in the next 30 minutes and take your phone calls for Dr. Leonard Horowitz and the investigative journalist he's collaborating with at Fluscam.com, his website.
[00:49:41.581 --> 00:49:45.364]  And of course, we're going to continue with your calls, but when we come back,
[00:49:46.124 --> 00:49:54.681]  I do, after this one minute break, 70 seconds if you want to be technical, with the station ID, I want to ask him about this Reuters article that I was just...
[00:49:56.041 --> 00:50:04.690]  Mentioning, I just had it in front of me, but I'll dig it out during the break, where they are openly saying that all these people are going to die.
[00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:12.918]  They are openly saying that even though there's going to be all these deaths after you take the flu shot, it's not the flu shot.
[00:50:12.938 --> 00:50:14.280]  And it's Reuters saying this.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.304]  This key group that Dr. Horowitz and Ms.
[00:50:18.344 --> 00:50:18.664]  Cain
[00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:21.246]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:21.286 --> 00:50:21.967]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.691 --> 00:50:54.654]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:50:54.934 --> 00:50:56.696]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:50:56.936 --> 00:51:05.202]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:10.666]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:51:11.007 --> 00:51:12.628]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:51:12.848 --> 00:51:19.174]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:51:19.374 --> 00:51:30.123]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:51:30.423 --> 00:51:30.884]  That's right.
[00:51:31.184 --> 00:51:33.485]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:51:33.746 --> 00:51:37.087]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:40.429]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:48.274]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:51:48.454 --> 00:51:49.775]  That's acolablue.com.
[00:51:53.757 --> 00:51:55.658]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.138 --> 00:51:58.920]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:05.538 --> 00:52:10.499]  Here is the Reuters article and it says millions of people are going to die
[00:52:32.296 --> 00:52:35.699]  After taking the flu shot, but it's not the flu shot that's going to kill you.
[00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:42.966]  They're diagnosing everyone saying there's going to be no adverse reactions, even though they admit every vaccine, even those that push them, have adverse reactions.
[00:52:43.726 --> 00:52:55.377]  And Dr. Horowitz, Sherry Cain, you were bringing up this director of Reuters, who's also a Bilderberg member, being a key operative in this and profiting from it and knowing, knowing,
[00:52:56.317 --> 00:53:02.221]  And the medical community is asking, how did they know day one that it was swine, bird, and human all mixed with the H1N1?
[00:53:02.821 --> 00:53:04.142]  Dr. Horowitz and Sherry Cain.
[00:53:04.642 --> 00:53:22.152]  Well, Thomas Gloser, who is the CEO and director of Thomson Reuters, which is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, is also the director of Merck & Company, which is the leading pharmaceutical company in the world that manufactures influenza and HPV vaccines.
[00:53:23.735 --> 00:53:27.318]  He's also on the board of directors for Partnership for New York City.
[00:53:27.758 --> 00:53:45.172]  Again, we go back to David Rockefeller's Partnership for New York City, which, if you look at the people on that board, who are also in charge of rebuilding the World Trade Center in partnership with Jerry Silverstein Properties.
[00:53:45.612 --> 00:53:51.137]  Jerry Silverstein, who purchased the World Trade Center six weeks before it came down.
[00:53:52.246 --> 00:53:54.628]  We can look at all the people that are players in this.
[00:53:55.408 --> 00:54:20.426]  Rupert Murdoch, who has the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, who is partnered with CSL, which is Australia's leading biopharmaceutical company that produces the Avion and H1 swine flu vaccination, and is now conducting swine flu vaccination trials on children between 6 months and 8 years old.
[00:54:21.492 --> 00:54:33.079]  They have recruited in Melbourne about 100 Victorian children aged between six months to eight who were targeted for study and collaboration with the University of Melbourne and the federal government of Australia.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.343]  The person that runs that is Sarah Murdoch, who is Rupert Murdoch's daughter-in-law.
[00:54:38.363 --> 00:54:45.127]  He is the chairman of the Partnership of New York City, but here's something really interesting.
[00:54:45.467 --> 00:54:46.828]  Co-chairman for
[00:54:47.363 --> 00:54:49.003]  They've been using those as hype.
[00:54:49.023 --> 00:54:57.926]  We noticed three months ago they'd have military drills of locking down universities and in those universities are the ones where they hype it and claim there's been 2,000 cases.
[00:55:16.039 --> 00:55:17.640]  Right, so it's a RICO scam.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:24.201]  It's an organized crime ring and it's being run initially out of New York by David Rockefeller et al.
[00:55:25.702 --> 00:55:36.525]  And he's, he, he, in the Encyclopedia Britannica, the founder of the Rockefeller family and then his son and now David in all the literature, mainline Pulitzer Prize winning books, Black's book,
[00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.570]  on it.
[00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.371]  It's always the Rockefellers.
[00:55:39.431 --> 00:55:41.833]  They created the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[00:55:41.933 --> 00:55:45.395]  Hitler thanked them in his speeches and in Mein Kampf.
[00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:48.696]  I mean, these guys have set up the architecture of our planet.
[00:55:48.997 --> 00:55:50.998]  They're social Darwinistic eugenicists.
[00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:53.379]  Dr. Horowitz, can you speak to their mindset briefly?
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:56:02.304]  Well, the mindset, obviously, is either they're extraterrestrial or they're absolutely demonically traumatized when they're young.
[00:56:02.544 --> 00:56:05.406]  And because when you study, as I have, and I've worked
[00:56:06.016 --> 00:56:15.329]  With the FBI's official methods and materials in diagnosing organized serial killers and apprehending them by understanding their mindset.
[00:56:15.369 --> 00:56:17.912]  Yeah, that's how you first got famous back in the 80s.
[00:56:18.453 --> 00:56:23.360]  Right, that's my area of primary expertise, Harvard investigator, in regard to
[00:56:24.102 --> 00:56:33.675]  Looking at, you know, medical sociology, psychopathology, and how we can try to change, how we can actually develop beyond this trauma-based therapy.
[00:56:33.695 --> 00:56:38.381]  Stay there, I want to talk more about that, because that's right, you were all over the news in the 80s exposing the doctors.
[00:56:39.042 --> 00:56:40.944]  With the AIDS and killing people and all of that.
[00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:45.307]  And so that's your degree is in studying that type of special medical criminology.
[00:56:45.608 --> 00:56:48.170]  That's why you can predict the anthrax attacks with total precision.
[00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:50.091]  That's how you're able to predict all this.
[00:56:50.151 --> 00:56:53.234]  My God, Dr. Horowitz, what an asset you are, my friend.
[00:56:53.294 --> 00:56:54.195]  A true maverick.
[00:56:54.635 --> 00:56:55.796]  A true renaissance man.
[00:56:56.196 --> 00:56:59.539]  And you've got a great investigative journalist working with you as well, Sherry Kane.
[00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:03.638]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:57:04.098 --> 00:57:07.259]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:12.081]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:57:12.301 --> 00:57:17.883]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:57:18.183 --> 00:57:22.666]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:57:22.947 --> 00:57:25.989]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:30.972]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:57:31.393 --> 00:57:37.677]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:57:37.957 --> 00:57:39.899]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:57:40.379 --> 00:57:43.202]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:57:43.582 --> 00:57:47.646]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:57:48.087 --> 00:57:50.229]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:57:50.249 --> 00:57:50.289]  877-327-0365.
[00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.809]  Don't wait.
[00:57:50.869 --> 00:57:51.310]  Call today.
[00:58:00.839 --> 00:58:08.325]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:08.605 --> 00:58:14.390]  You can buy it at hereiswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:17.372]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:58:17.632 --> 00:58:23.537]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:25.338]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:58:25.498 --> 00:58:27.759]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:58:27.959 --> 00:58:33.361]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:58:33.601 --> 00:58:35.422]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:37.062]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:58:37.422 --> 00:58:39.683]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:58:39.963 --> 00:58:44.325]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:58:44.685 --> 00:58:48.067]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:58:48.387 --> 00:58:50.528]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:58:51.508 --> 00:58:52.929]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:53.409 --> 00:58:56.031]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:01.054 --> 00:59:03.656]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:04.076 --> 00:59:09.059]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.141]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:16.284]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:16.464 --> 00:59:17.385]  How much do you want?
[00:59:17.625 --> 00:59:18.385]  When do you want it?
[00:59:18.746 --> 00:59:20.347]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:20.627 --> 00:59:21.467]  When will you need it?
[00:59:21.707 --> 00:59:23.768]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:23.908 --> 00:59:25.009]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:25.249 --> 00:59:26.590]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:31.853]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:32.053 --> 00:59:35.215]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:35.635 --> 00:59:39.097]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:39.457 --> 00:59:40.418]  How much will you need?
[00:59:40.678 --> 00:59:41.278]  We don't know.
[00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:42.479]  How much do you want?
[00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:43.420]  All you can get.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.460]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.462]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:47.742 --> 00:59:49.924]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:49.944 --> 00:59:50.964]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:50.984 --> 00:59:51.264]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:08.422]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.162 --> 01:00:10.903]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.923 --> 01:00:11.724]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.524 --> 01:00:14.025]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.065 --> 01:00:17.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:22.330]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.223 --> 01:00:32.325]  We're going to your phone calls here in just a moment, but the break interrupted, Dr. Horowitz.
[01:00:32.985 --> 01:00:37.847]  Dr. Horowitz, you're talking about this being a crime syndicate, a racketeering operation, all the evidence is there.
[01:00:39.947 --> 01:00:45.890]  You were finishing up with studying medical criminology, and then we're going to go to calls.
[01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:46.230]  Go ahead.
[01:00:46.752 --> 01:01:04.095]  Well, again, you know, there's so much evidence that shows when a child is traumatized, and basically that's how medicine is actually, the doctors are actually Manchurian candidates, licensed to kill the brainwashed, mind-controlled slaves by trauma.
[01:01:04.115 --> 01:01:14.157]  The whole medical education process reflects what takes place, has got to take place in serial killers' minds, because what happens, the neurology gets crossed.
[01:01:15.399 --> 01:01:24.461]  People, normal people, joy brings them anxiety, and what brings normal people fear and horror brings them joy.
[01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:29.122]  Instead of nurturing, they enjoy strapping a child down and ripping their teeth out with pliers.
[01:01:29.362 --> 01:01:30.962]  Yeah, they actually do.
[01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:39.863]  That's exactly how organized serial killers feel and think, and because of the trauma that they sustain with their child, their children.
[01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.424]  Look at Stalin, look at Hitler, look at Mao.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.141]  Yeah, and this is what's going on in these secret societies.
[01:01:47.501 --> 01:01:54.683]  Basically, you remember there was a reporter several years ago that was, I believe he was killed, after going in and George H.W.
[01:01:54.724 --> 01:01:57.744]  Bush was asked, you know, what about the skull and bones?
[01:01:57.804 --> 01:01:58.385]  And he laughed.
[01:01:58.685 --> 01:02:04.787]  Well, that reporter was actually videotaping them conducting mock killings.
[01:02:05.987 --> 01:02:09.068]  And so this is kind of what we're dealing with.
[01:02:09.108 --> 01:02:11.749]  We're not dealing with normal human beings.
[01:02:12.327 --> 01:02:17.190]  And that this is what your number one risk in society is.
[01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:32.219]  As a behavioral science expert and a social, a medical sociologist, I can tell you that the number one risk that people have this concept that there can't possibly be people who are so evil, when in fact it is your love.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:39.424]  It is the truth in your heart that really is inconceivable to you that people could do this.
[01:02:39.764 --> 01:02:41.165]  That's your blind spot!
[01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:44.869]  That's why women, you know, got in the yellow Volkswagen with Ted Bundy.
[01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.271]  Look at this evidence.
[01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:54.222]  Ecoscience alone, when he went before Jay Rockefeller to be confirmed as the White House science czar, and we have these clips in the upcoming film,
[01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:58.104]  Jay Rockefeller worships him.
[01:02:58.184 --> 01:03:03.125]  They worship Zbigniew Brzezinski because he brags he helped kill 3 million in Cambodia, funding that.
[01:03:03.485 --> 01:03:04.805]  That's their rock stars.
[01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:08.126]  To them, they want control so they can kill.
[01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:13.068]  Just like other tyrants, when they get control, suddenly start setting up death camps in every case.
[01:03:13.548 --> 01:03:14.508]  This is their beauty.
[01:03:14.588 --> 01:03:21.450]  Black uniforms, piles of dead bodies, torture, screaming, death, Hellraiser, Event Horizon type stuff.
[01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.831]  This is what they're into and eco-science is admitting.
[01:03:25.191 --> 01:03:32.694]  They want to kill at least 80% of us and they believe it's beautiful and it's totally sick and they put their messages everywhere.
[01:03:32.734 --> 01:03:41.178]  I was telling people earlier, Dr. Horowitz, I was watching this morning on the treadmill, I was jogging, I was watching Mark Wahlberg's film
[01:03:42.538 --> 01:03:59.410]  Titled The Happening, where the environment gets mad, the plants kill everybody by making them commit suicide with a chemical, the plants release, and as this guy is being run over by a lawnmower, he turns on the big lawnmower, the big riding mower runs it over him, it cuts to a billboard that says, this is what you deserve.
[01:04:00.151 --> 01:04:07.516]  And it's all these movies and all these shows about everybody dying from a bio-release, they are getting everyone ready for this mass killing.
[01:04:09.275 --> 01:04:09.515]  Right.
[01:04:09.696 --> 01:04:13.439]  You know, and again, to do that, you're not dealing with anything normal.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:25.611]  It's either extraterrestrial or it's trauma-based, you know, human that's become an organized mass murderer, and that the... By extraterrestrial, you mean demonic?
[01:04:26.692 --> 01:04:31.017]  Yeah, again, because, you know, I have a spiritual orientation, and
[01:04:31.949 --> 01:04:33.750]  Basically, you know, it's talked about in the Bible.
[01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:41.696]  There's things called Nephilim, fallen angels, who come into the daughters of men, change the genetics, and that's why it rained for 40 days and 40 nights back in Noah's age.
[01:04:42.196 --> 01:04:44.478]  We're dealing with the genetic engineers of today!
[01:04:45.234 --> 01:04:50.116]  And, you know, my own orientation to this is that, you know, the Creator is not going to stand for it.
[01:04:50.276 --> 01:04:58.579]  You know, there's nothing more powerful than the Creator in the universe, and we who are working for the Creator, you know, there's a lot more light than darkness, and basically... You know what's funny?
[01:04:58.639 --> 01:05:08.963]  The transhumanists that I covered in Endgame, to a man, Kurzweil, all of them, say they're going to be gods, they're going to become creators, they're going to merge with machine, and then they're going to kill the rest of us.
[01:05:09.403 --> 01:05:10.124]  And to a man...
[01:05:11.943 --> 01:05:12.864]  That's what they're up to.
[01:05:12.884 --> 01:05:17.669]  I mean, even if this isn't real, I mean, even if they're just delusional, these people are crazy.
[01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:18.971]  They're out there.
[01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:20.252]  They're completely gone.
[01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:31.344]  And the sad thing is that the normal human being can't conceive of the devilishness of these people and what the risk is to them for not waking up.
[01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:37.351]  I believe that these people are definitely worshipping Satan.
[01:05:37.831 --> 01:05:45.879]  If you even watch the film Eyes Wide Shut, one of Stanley Kubrick's last films, it gives you an example of the kind of people they are.
[01:05:46.279 --> 01:05:49.702]  By the way, they killed him and cut 25 minutes out.
[01:05:49.762 --> 01:05:51.544]  I have that from sources in Hollywood.
[01:05:51.564 --> 01:05:52.645]  Oh yeah, I believe that.
[01:05:52.805 --> 01:05:55.408]  You know, I snuck into the real Eyes Wide Shut Bohemian Grove.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.762]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:05:57.842 --> 01:05:58.864]  I applaud you.
[01:05:58.984 --> 01:06:00.326]  It's amazing.
[01:06:00.447 --> 01:06:05.736]  I mean, I knew that something happened with him because he was really revealing all of his movies were about, based on truth.
[01:06:06.177 --> 01:06:08.301]  Well, I mean, here's an example, Sharon, and I want you to comment on that.
[01:06:09.429 --> 01:06:19.478]  Uh, Dr. Eric Bianca, who made headlines three years ago, two and a half years ago, saying, I want a weaponized Ebola to be released, kill 90%, I'm ready for my family to die, I want to die.
[01:06:19.939 --> 01:06:31.148]  Rob Jacobson was at Whole Foods the other day, the girl saw him with the, uh, somewhere in my stack, Newsweek, the case for killing Granny, and how great it is to kill the old people, and
[01:06:32.068 --> 01:06:33.929]  He said, well, they want to kill you too.
[01:06:33.969 --> 01:06:35.410]  And she said, good, I need to die.
[01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:36.491]  Humans are bad.
[01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:39.533]  But going back to Pianca, you go to his UT website.
[01:06:39.553 --> 01:06:40.553]  I checked it again a month ago.
[01:06:40.593 --> 01:06:41.174]  It's still there.
[01:06:41.194 --> 01:06:43.535]  This is the official UT website.
[01:06:43.915 --> 01:06:50.700]  It's him dressed as a druid with a big beard and talking about how much he loves Lucifer on the UT website.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:57.364]  And every time you research Maurice Strong or any of them, they are completely open worshipers of Lucifer.
[01:06:57.384 --> 01:06:57.684]  Go ahead.
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:04.655]  Well, I mean, the whole idea of that, that Satanism is even much more mainstream than people realize.
[01:07:04.695 --> 01:07:09.939]  I mean, look at all the followers of L. Ron Hubbard, who was a well-known Satanist.
[01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:15.084]  This man was following Aleister Crowley, and there were so many people involved in his group.
[01:07:15.504 --> 01:07:25.052]  So if you, you know, if you really research who's involved, and all the people and players, they see it as not only, they don't see it as less of a religion, but more of a
[01:07:25.812 --> 01:07:26.193]  I'm good.
[01:07:34.948 --> 01:07:40.771]  And, you know, the outcome is this indoctrination of the culture.
[01:07:41.251 --> 01:07:49.255]  We are an American medical culture that we've now been engineered, behaviorally, socially engineered to become.
[01:07:49.715 --> 01:07:51.316]  And this is the greatest challenge.
[01:07:51.616 --> 01:08:01.401]  You know, it is a complete fraud to say that the behavioral sciences is a soft science compared to, let's say, you know, mathematics or physics.
[01:08:02.102 --> 01:08:17.545]  Those are considered hard sciences, but the truth of the matter is the most powerful and the most well-studied and meticulously directed science of all is the mass mind control mainstream media's behavioral science.
[01:08:17.585 --> 01:08:18.765]  And the Pentagon says that.
[01:08:18.805 --> 01:08:19.906]  They admit it.
[01:08:19.946 --> 01:08:22.146]  They say 90% of warfare is psychological.
[01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:25.287]  If the people will just become conscious of this, we can beat it.
[01:08:25.527 --> 01:08:28.167]  But if you won't wake up out of your trance, folks, there's no hope.
[01:08:28.707 --> 01:08:32.168]  Leah, son is in school, has a story about the flu shot.
[01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:32.608]  Go ahead.
[01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:34.329]  Yes, hi.
[01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:37.349]  First off, I want to say thank you for waking up.
[01:08:37.389 --> 01:08:38.970]  We've been listening to you for about a year.
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:42.250]  And this is the first time I've called.
[01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.371]  My son came home on Friday from school.
[01:08:44.974 --> 01:08:49.516]  He's saying that he was asked to escort a student to the front office who was ill.
[01:08:50.316 --> 01:08:58.720]  They placed a mask on the ill child's face and had my son escort him to the front office, to the clinic, while waiting to go back to his classroom.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:05.062]  See, this is a fear-mongering indoctrination where they get everybody trained to freak out so the medical mafia can come in.
[01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:06.583]  So your son is escorting him.
[01:09:06.603 --> 01:09:07.003]  Go ahead.
[01:09:08.724 --> 01:09:13.486]  In the office, he's waiting for his...somebody walked him to the class nurse.
[01:09:15.745 --> 01:09:16.005]  We're good.
[01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.729]  What is the name of your school?
[01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:41.490]  This is huge.
[01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:44.712]  So without parent consent, your son saw them inject.
[01:09:44.752 --> 01:09:45.633]  What's the name of the school?
[01:09:46.173 --> 01:09:48.094]  The name of the school is Zellwood Elementary School.
[01:09:48.114 --> 01:09:49.195]  It's in Orange County, Florida.
[01:09:49.215 --> 01:09:51.317]  Okay, your phone's cutting out.
[01:09:51.617 --> 01:09:52.978]  Elementary in Orange County, Florida?
[01:09:53.818 --> 01:09:56.340]  Zellwood Elementary School in Orange County, Florida.
[01:09:58.242 --> 01:10:00.483]  And we spoke to them this morning.
[01:10:00.503 --> 01:10:01.384]  We spoke to the principal.
[01:10:01.404 --> 01:10:02.425]  We had a meeting with the principal.
[01:10:02.445 --> 01:10:04.126]  The principal said she was going to look into it.
[01:10:04.751 --> 01:10:05.972]  My husband proceeded to leave.
[01:10:06.092 --> 01:10:08.253]  I stated I was going to go on a field trip today.
[01:10:09.573 --> 01:10:22.278]  The principal then called me and my son as well as the clinic nurse and his teacher, my son's teacher, into the office and intimidating sort of asked my son, did you see this?
[01:10:22.839 --> 01:10:24.279]  And my son said, yes I did.
[01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:29.041]  The nurse proceeded to stand up, smack her hand on the table violently and call my son a liar.
[01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:32.528]  Completely upset.
[01:10:32.648 --> 01:10:34.910]  Spoke with another parent of a student in the same class.
[01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.092]  She had no idea that anyone was in the school.
[01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.334]  We've gotten no notice that someone... Well, let me stop you.
[01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.195]  That's what they do.
[01:10:40.376 --> 01:10:45.340]  Obama says there's no shots, but we have the letters confirming from the nurses they're forcing them.
[01:10:46.061 --> 01:10:47.242]  My God, stay there, ma'am.
[01:10:47.262 --> 01:10:50.165]  Dr. Horowitz, we may have to keep you longer into the hour to take more of these calls.
[01:10:50.185 --> 01:10:53.128]  They're all lined up here with people here witnessing this.
[01:10:53.468 --> 01:10:55.370]  I mean, this looks like this is criminal.
[01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:55.971]  This is true.
[01:10:56.633 --> 01:10:57.436]  It is criminal.
[01:10:57.597 --> 01:11:02.332]  It's absolute official criminal malfeasance and beyond gross negligence.
[01:11:02.853 --> 01:11:08.595]  Gross negligence is where you, basically, you know what to do, but you don't do it.
[01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:15.258]  This is where there's an actual agenda to inject, and somebody's telling people... Hold on!
[01:11:15.578 --> 01:11:21.100]  How many hospitals have been caught when parents say no vaccines, they take the baby away and inject them?
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.001]  That's illegal!
[01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:23.421]  They just do whatever the hell they want!
[01:11:23.601 --> 01:11:24.602]  They think they're gods!
[01:11:24.622 --> 01:11:26.523]  They're a priesthood of control freaks!
[01:11:26.563 --> 01:11:27.423]  Sorry, doctor, go ahead.
[01:11:27.543 --> 01:11:31.607]  That's exactly right and this is what I've been absolutely appalled at.
[01:11:31.707 --> 01:11:34.369]  People in public health and the officials in medicine.
[01:11:34.809 --> 01:11:36.511]  These are supposed to be my colleagues.
[01:11:36.891 --> 01:11:40.835]  These people are absolute mass murderers and they've got to stop this.
[01:11:42.045 --> 01:11:47.610]  My God, and they know we're waking up to them, so they're trying to come in, scare us, set the precedent to forcibly inject.
[01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:48.611]  Stay there, Leah.
[01:11:48.631 --> 01:11:49.352]  Finish your story.
[01:11:49.412 --> 01:11:50.353]  Recap it when we get back.
[01:11:50.653 --> 01:11:57.979]  In Paul, Louisiana, friend told to take shot at work, Nate in Georgia, Anthony, Elijah, and others.
[01:11:57.999 --> 01:11:58.400]  Stay with us.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.521]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:12:02.581 --> 01:12:07.923]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:12:08.163 --> 01:12:12.805]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:12:13.185 --> 01:12:13.585]  It's true.
[01:12:13.665 --> 01:12:18.267]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:23.449]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:12:23.989 --> 01:12:25.850]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.903]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:12:31.103 --> 01:12:31.984]  And here's the best part.
[01:12:32.204 --> 01:12:34.986]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:12:35.286 --> 01:12:38.589]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:12:38.909 --> 01:12:41.751]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.972]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:12:44.313 --> 01:12:45.173]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:12:45.193 --> 01:12:45.413]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:12:45.433 --> 01:12:46.574]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:12:55.393 --> 01:12:57.621]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:12:57.943 --> 01:13:00.332]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.908]  There are many guarantees in this world.
[01:13:03.148 --> 01:13:06.649]  The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:14.151]  During the great hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and invested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:17.032]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S.
[01:13:17.072 --> 01:13:17.372]  today.
[01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:18.352]  I'll send you a list.
[01:13:18.452 --> 01:13:27.275]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[01:13:27.495 --> 01:13:29.596]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources.
[01:13:29.856 --> 01:13:34.882]  Many of the people I talked to today are aware of trouble coming, but haven't taken action to protect themselves.
[01:13:35.023 --> 01:13:39.989]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with little warning.
[01:13:40.129 --> 01:13:40.970]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:41.651]  Protect yourself.
[01:13:41.931 --> 01:13:43.653]  Call me today, Bob Moss, at 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[01:13:48.359 --> 01:13:54.122]  That's Bob Moss, Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[01:13:54.902 --> 01:14:00.325]  Again, that's Bob Moss, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[01:14:01.685 --> 01:14:03.086]  It is a big idea.
[01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:05.207]  A new world order.
[01:14:05.907 --> 01:14:10.209]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.611]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:14:13.651 --> 01:14:15.792]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:18.858]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:14:19.599 --> 01:14:26.902]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:14:29.937 --> 01:14:34.921]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:38.783]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:14:59.688]  More.

[01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:11.890]  Okay, Leah, son in school, Zellwood Elementary, Orange County, Florida.
[01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:16.111]  So, the nurse slams her hand down and says, you're a liar to your son.
[01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:19.112]  What about this other little boy?
[01:16:19.152 --> 01:16:19.692]  Was he there?
[01:16:19.712 --> 01:16:20.912]  I guess he was at home sick.
[01:16:21.772 --> 01:16:26.574]  No, actually, he had showed back up at school on Monday and told everyone that he had had swine flu.
[01:16:27.972 --> 01:16:35.534]  And I really just want to put this out there because we were very persistent today that we had told the principal we only want verification that this did not happen.
[01:16:36.027 --> 01:16:36.908]  I don't think so.
[01:16:58.539 --> 01:17:00.721]  We've got to make them the models for simply
[01:17:17.062 --> 01:17:20.406]  But doctor, are you not supposed to give a flu shot to somebody who's already got it?
[01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.104]  Yes, there are numerous contraindications.
[01:17:40.144 --> 01:17:40.984]  That's one of them.
[01:17:41.425 --> 01:17:46.409]  Also, there's 15% of the population, approximately, that have eczema.
[01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:48.691]  That's an autoimmune disease.
[01:17:48.771 --> 01:17:53.996]  It's an ailment that also indicates your immune system would be potentially overwhelmed by vaccination.
[01:17:54.477 --> 01:17:57.339]  All of these risks are being completely neglected.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.921]  The school administrators
[01:17:59.561 --> 01:18:11.051]  As well as what's taking place in, like we talked about earlier, Safeway supermarket pharmacist we interviewed the other day had no clue what's even in the vaccinations that he's administering.
[01:18:11.111 --> 01:18:13.913]  And we asked him, would you take this vaccination yourself?
[01:18:13.953 --> 01:18:15.094]  And he said, of course not.
[01:18:15.514 --> 01:18:17.556]  Well then I asked, how do you administer it?
[01:18:17.976 --> 01:18:21.019]  Oh, two years ago I had the Prince George County, Maryland
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.340]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.461]  You know, again, it's demonic.
[01:18:52.393 --> 01:18:55.415]  It's a sinful spirit that takes over these people's minds.
[01:18:55.815 --> 01:18:56.596]  It is a spirit!
[01:18:56.636 --> 01:19:03.480]  More and more I realize, as a layman, not even coming from a secular perspective, it's like a download.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.021]  It's like a giggling demon.
[01:19:05.081 --> 01:19:11.785]  It's like funny and happy and they love it and they laugh when they're stealing people's kids.
[01:19:11.906 --> 01:19:12.926]  What is that?
[01:19:13.246 --> 01:19:14.487]  It's like they're all the same.
[01:19:14.527 --> 01:19:15.588]  Their eyes are the same.
[01:19:16.328 --> 01:19:17.289]  Yeah, it's a cult.
[01:19:17.469 --> 01:19:19.432]  It's a cult indoctrination.
[01:19:19.472 --> 01:19:25.599]  They have literally been brainwashed by the use of trauma into a certain track mentality.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.082]  And it's a consciousness system.
[01:19:28.382 --> 01:19:34.550]  You know, like, there's a cognitive, there's a little voice in the back of your head that sometimes you have to say, shut up, will ya?
[01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:35.591]  I don't want to do that.
[01:19:36.011 --> 01:19:40.294]  These guys are ingrained in it, engaged in it, and it has taken over them.
[01:19:40.335 --> 01:19:41.996]  They have no reasonable sense.
[01:19:42.076 --> 01:19:44.598]  They have no desire to look at the facts.
[01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:46.800]  They have no desire to even look at the science.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:53.585]  They are simply following an agenda like any mind-controlled Manchurian candidate would.
[01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:55.281]  That's it!
[01:19:55.401 --> 01:20:02.644]  I mean, more and more I realize, and I read Pentagon documents, psych warfare documents that are declassified, they say they're putting the public into a state.
[01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.764]  They say a lower alpha state.
[01:20:04.804 --> 01:20:07.725]  They say that they don't want the public to snap out of it.
[01:20:08.105 --> 01:20:10.066]  The general public is hypnotized.
[01:20:10.466 --> 01:20:18.369]  Once they're hypnotized, they can put in the programming, and we're literally dealing with people that have been turned into nothing but biological androids.
[01:20:18.749 --> 01:20:34.280]  Right, and then when you really consider this in the theological sense, if you look at the book of Revelation, for example, it says those who fornicated with the devil in the end times and deceived the wealthiest men of all the nations, that's of course the Rockefeller et al.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:38.944]  group, because to deceive the wealthiest men of all the nations, you've got to be mega-wealthy.
[01:20:39.444 --> 01:20:41.068]  They practice sorcery.
[01:20:41.328 --> 01:20:43.973]  Look up the root word in concordance of sorcery.
[01:20:44.254 --> 01:20:45.336]  It's pharmacopeia.
[01:20:45.636 --> 01:20:49.884]  These are the pharmaceutical industrialists that then cast magic spells.
[01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:53.331]  That's why the symbol of medicine is the double snakes.
[01:21:10.885 --> 01:21:15.447]  We now know who they are, we now know how they're operating, and we can't trust them.
[01:21:15.547 --> 01:21:25.250]  Now we've got to simply continue to wake up our beloved friends and neighbors and relatives to say, hey, if I love you and you love me, we've got a problem here.
[01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:26.751]  Let's do something about it.
[01:21:26.991 --> 01:21:35.294]  And we've got to get these attorneys to literally issue their restraining orders, not only on these administrators, but also on the health officials.
[01:21:35.574 --> 01:21:36.194]  We've got to break.
[01:21:36.214 --> 01:21:38.535]  We're going to race through five calls on the other side.
[01:21:39.076 --> 01:21:40.056]  Your call, straight ahead.
[01:21:51.371 --> 01:21:52.254]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.755 --> 01:21:54.359]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:58.009]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.644]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:04.884 --> 01:22:06.666]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:06.906 --> 01:22:15.174]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:15.415 --> 01:22:20.640]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.602]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:22.822 --> 01:22:29.144]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:40.086]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:40.386 --> 01:22:40.886]  That's right.
[01:22:41.147 --> 01:22:43.447]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:43.707 --> 01:22:45.288]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[01:22:47.869 --> 01:23:05.804]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:23:05.944 --> 01:23:07.906]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:10.308]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:23:10.468 --> 01:23:12.309]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.091]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:23:14.371 --> 01:23:15.412]  There is a solution.
[01:23:15.612 --> 01:23:23.638]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:25:12.386 --> 01:25:17.489]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now for people that have been patiently holding.
[01:25:17.549 --> 01:25:20.870]  Leah, stay in contact with us with what's happening with her son at that school.
[01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:22.391]  We'll try to nail down if that happened or not.
[01:25:23.532 --> 01:25:26.933]  Let's talk to Paul in Louisiana.
[01:25:27.394 --> 01:25:28.374]  You're on the air.
[01:25:28.434 --> 01:25:29.295]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:25:30.075 --> 01:25:30.515]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:30.976 --> 01:25:35.798]  Alex, I'd like to thank you and your family and let you know we're praying for you and yours as you do that job.
[01:25:35.818 --> 01:25:36.939]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:38.098 --> 01:25:38.558]  A yellow star.
[01:26:04.443 --> 01:26:07.509]  So he starts treating her for the flu, you know, automatically.
[01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:09.514]  Nothing, no questions, just start treating her.
[01:26:09.534 --> 01:26:14.383]  Yeah, we see a lot of that, Dr. Horowitz, where people don't even have the flu, but they put out false reports that they do.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:38.432]  The other thing is that the treatment, if you think about the abuse of antibiotics and how antibiotics' toxicity, and the concept of us constantly creating new microbes from overuse of antibiotics, even for viral infections, they're prescribing antibiotics, which is, they should be prescribing antivirals, and then the antivirals, like the Tamiflu, totally toxic.
[01:26:38.772 --> 01:26:45.096]  You know, again, this is why I urge people to consider the silver hydrosols, especially OxySilver.com.
[01:26:46.053 --> 01:26:46.613]  Absolutely.
[01:26:46.673 --> 01:26:47.154]  Thank you.
[01:26:47.174 --> 01:26:48.694]  Paul, good to hear from you.
[01:26:48.734 --> 01:26:51.075]  Nate in Georgia has questions for our guest.
[01:26:51.095 --> 01:26:51.816]  Go ahead, Nate.
[01:26:52.676 --> 01:26:53.517]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:26:53.617 --> 01:26:54.217]  It's been a while.
[01:26:54.837 --> 01:26:55.317]  God bless you.
[01:26:55.337 --> 01:26:55.858]  What's on your mind?
[01:26:56.758 --> 01:26:59.359]  Well, I just wanted to talk about the swine flu.
[01:26:59.459 --> 01:27:01.120]  I have two stories I wanted to tell you.
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:05.662]  A couple weeks ago, my fiancee's little sister, she went to school in Roswell, Georgia.
[01:27:05.682 --> 01:27:06.883]  It's called Centennial.
[01:27:07.543 --> 01:27:15.107]  And when she went to school, when she went to go see the school nurse, they told her that she had to take a swine flu shot.
[01:27:15.857 --> 01:27:20.339]  Um, and if she didn't take the shot, the teachers would be arrested and charged with misdemeanor.
[01:27:21.279 --> 01:27:30.803]  Well, the nurse, uh, uh, the nurse, you know, kind of knew how to get out of taking a shot, had her sign a waiver saying that she was a Jehovah's Witness and she couldn't take the shot.
[01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:32.804]  So that's how she got out of taking the shot.
[01:27:33.285 --> 01:27:38.767]  And then another story, uh, I was at Publix, which is a, you know, a store down here in, uh, in, uh, Georgia.
[01:27:39.367 --> 01:27:41.228]  I was here in Publix, I was walking through the store.
[01:27:41.903 --> 01:27:48.286]  One of the co-workers, you know, all of the grocery stores give the swine flu shot now, and the regular flu shot.
[01:27:48.606 --> 01:27:51.507]  So this guy just went and got the swine flu shot in the public store.
[01:27:51.948 --> 01:27:56.750]  Well, two hours after he had the shot, he had almost, it was like a stroke-like symptom.
[01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:00.051]  Bust his head on the counter, literally split his head open in two.
[01:28:00.712 --> 01:28:04.193]  Fell on the floor, was all bleeding, shaking in convulsions as if he was having a stroke.
[01:28:05.074 --> 01:28:07.815]  They called the police, and the people around him
[01:28:08.732 --> 01:28:09.733]  I'm like, well, what happened to him?
[01:28:09.753 --> 01:28:15.937]  They said, well, the only thing that happened was he took the swine flu shot a couple of hours ago, and then he, you know, went into convulsions.
[01:28:16.217 --> 01:28:22.222]  And I'm just amazed that the people sitting around him didn't put two and two together and realize that the swine flu shot caused it.
[01:28:22.282 --> 01:28:32.189]  Well, that's because Reuters has told everybody you're not allowed to say it's connected to that, even though every other vaccine always causes things like this to happen.
[01:28:32.309 --> 01:28:35.351]  And who is the director of Reuters?
[01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:36.592]  Thomas Gloucester.
[01:28:37.296 --> 01:28:53.752]  And Thomas Gloucester is also the director of the Merck, which is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, mostly responsible for what we're looking at, HIV AIDS today by the transmission through the hepatitis B vaccines, given between 1972 and 74.
[01:28:57.639 --> 01:29:05.024]  I mean, imagine you're in a maze and you're stuck and there's no exit because everywhere you turn there's another connection to all of these people.
[01:29:05.324 --> 01:29:08.026]  They're all in collaboration with each other.
[01:29:08.446 --> 01:29:09.427]  And they're hunting us.
[01:29:09.467 --> 01:29:11.708]  They're literally doing what psychopaths do.
[01:29:11.748 --> 01:29:12.789]  Thank you so much, Nate.
[01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:14.850]  Anthony in New York.
[01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:15.971]  Flu questions for the guests.
[01:29:15.991 --> 01:29:16.391]  Go ahead.
[01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:17.852]  Okay, hello?
[01:29:17.892 --> 01:29:20.494]  You hear me?
[01:29:21.114 --> 01:29:21.695]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:22.735]  Hello?
[01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:23.736]  Yes, thank you.
[01:29:23.896 --> 01:29:24.677]  Alex Jones.
[01:29:25.646 --> 01:29:27.727]  Deeply respect, and I'm grateful for your show.
[01:29:27.767 --> 01:29:33.390]  I've been listening to it for a couple of years now, and Dr. Horowitz, you're one of my heroes.
[01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:51.558]  I'm greatly informed by all the research you've been doing, and I don't know, I'm in a predicament that you are also in, Dr. Horowitz, which is I have a schoolchild here, mine in a school in New York, and I have
[01:29:52.757 --> 01:29:53.157]  We're good.
[01:30:14.087 --> 01:30:17.528]  Children are the most precious thing in our lives.
[01:30:18.248 --> 01:30:20.929]  The teachers themselves aren't bad, but the system is bad.
[01:30:21.069 --> 01:30:22.969]  I don't think anybody should have their children in public school.
[01:30:22.989 --> 01:30:24.410]  I'm not making a moral judgment here.
[01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:26.650]  I'm just saying my children are homeschooled.
[01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:30.231]  They don't get anywhere near a government-controlled facility.
[01:30:31.631 --> 01:30:32.652]  Well, I applaud that.
[01:30:32.732 --> 01:30:38.833]  You know, again, maybe I'm too nice a dad for my own children because I've been pressured by them.
[01:30:39.762 --> 01:30:47.766]  The one that I have right now, as a matter of fact, we're preparing this evening to go to Laguna Beach School Board meeting and then tomorrow to the Parents Teachers Association.
[01:30:48.107 --> 01:30:57.752]  Parents need to know right now that all the PTAs are gearing up by direction of virtually FEMA to direct the emergency response.
[01:30:58.337 --> 01:31:07.606]  Which they're predicting, and this whole vaccination agenda will be conducted partially or administered partially by volunteer parents from the PTA.
[01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.989]  So, number one, there's two things that I would recommend.
[01:31:11.553 --> 01:31:16.016]  And these are companies that have histories of killing people knowingly over and over again.
[01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:41.135]  Right, and then the other thing is, take the resolution on Fluescam.com.
[01:31:41.675 --> 01:31:43.597]  Copy and paste the resolution.
[01:31:43.917 --> 01:31:49.881]  There's the actual, the Hawaii, the new Hawaii resolution has gone through the attorneys from the county of Hawaii.
[01:31:49.901 --> 01:31:55.285]  They're currently, this coming week, debating it on the floor of the legislature.
[01:31:55.585 --> 01:31:57.767]  So, you have all that information.
[01:31:57.847 --> 01:32:02.510]  Copy and paste it and make your own county council and township resolution.
[01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:04.692]  Now tell people what the resolution says, briefly.
[01:32:05.213 --> 01:32:23.165]  The resolution states that because of all of these issues that we're talking about, that there shall be a religious exemption and philosophical exemption administered to anyone who wants to exempt from the vaccine program, and that children shall not be injected without their parents' consent.
[01:32:23.645 --> 01:32:25.306]  All right, thank you so much, Caller.
[01:32:25.326 --> 01:32:27.187]  A few final calls for our guests.
[01:32:28.148 --> 01:32:31.790]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alicia in California.
[01:32:31.831 --> 01:32:32.191]  Go ahead.
[01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:36.220]  Hi, Alex Jones.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.841]  I'm a big fan, and my dad is a big fan of you.
[01:32:40.901 --> 01:32:44.582]  It's just a great honor to be on your talk show.
[01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:45.543]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:32:45.563 --> 01:32:46.143]  What's on your mind?
[01:32:48.123 --> 01:32:55.706]  We've been doing some research about how they're talking about mandatory swine flu shots behind doors.
[01:32:56.946 --> 01:33:02.648]  Our school is leaning on the swine flu.
[01:33:04.042 --> 01:33:06.725]  Yeah, they're saying if you don't take the shot, we're gonna kick you out?
[01:33:06.745 --> 01:33:07.626]  Here's what you do.
[01:33:20.734 --> 01:33:26.838]  You download Alan Phillips' book on vaccination exemptions.
[01:33:27.239 --> 01:33:27.559]  Read it.
[01:33:27.619 --> 01:33:29.440]  It's only about 120 pages.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:37.066]  It's big writing and it's easy to read and he'll share with you the state laws as well as the number one
[01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:38.898]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:33:38.978 --> 01:33:40.219]  Yes, I work for Novartis.
[01:33:40.259 --> 01:33:41.360]  We're the number two
[01:34:07.233 --> 01:34:08.074]  We're good to go.
[01:34:29.451 --> 01:34:39.540]  I know, it's admittedly on the insert, admitted on their own website, and the news is... See, even if you believe all that it's good, how do you believe people who are always lying?
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:42.903]  I'm sorry sir, I'm going to shut up because you're a key person, Marcus.
[01:34:43.663 --> 01:34:47.887]  Tell us, as a vaccine worker, what's going on?
[01:34:49.929 --> 01:34:55.874]  We have, they're rolling out with a new one that's supposed to be a one-dose vaccine.
[01:34:58.584 --> 01:35:00.085]  What do you do for the vaccine company?
[01:35:23.406 --> 01:35:24.547]  Uh, the dailies.
[01:35:24.927 --> 01:35:27.029]  I have all access to all the information I wish.
[01:35:27.069 --> 01:35:28.350]  What are the workers saying?
[01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:30.111]  What are the workers saying around you?
[01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:37.376]  Well, the younger people, they, I'll say maybe in their mid-30s and below, they're not with it.
[01:35:37.416 --> 01:35:38.237]  They don't want to take it.
[01:35:38.337 --> 01:35:50.265]  But a lot of the older employees, I think just due to the overwhelming media hype, they fear for it and they're going to, a lot of them are going to go ahead and take it.
[01:35:50.305 --> 01:35:51.626]  But I'm warning a lot of them, man.
[01:35:52.065 --> 01:35:56.807]  Some are doing their research and they're going to think about it.
[01:35:58.147 --> 01:36:07.151]  We had meetings on it this past weekend in which they went down a full outline on the way that they're going to prescribe it to the employees.
[01:36:07.611 --> 01:36:09.172]  They haven't made it mandatory yet.
[01:36:09.872 --> 01:36:11.733]  Are they discussing making it mandatory?
[01:36:12.353 --> 01:36:13.113]  It's a discussion.
[01:36:13.473 --> 01:36:14.954]  It's a discussion that's taking place.
[01:36:15.615 --> 01:36:18.456]  Well, what they're doing is gauging whether they can make you take it.
[01:36:18.496 --> 01:36:30.222]  The federal government, we just confirmed this, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com in my stack, sent out questionnaires to CEOs and corporate leaders asking, will you follow orders for quarantines, forced inoculations?
[01:36:31.642 --> 01:36:32.083]  That's right.
[01:36:32.523 --> 01:36:43.728]  The new one that they came out with that the FDA just approved, I think it's called Seltura, the ML-59 adjuvant cell-based cultured one,
[01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:50.971]  They have it ready, and I think that's going to be one of the ones they're going to have available for the employees.
[01:36:51.332 --> 01:36:52.112]  Sir, what do you think?
[01:36:52.272 --> 01:36:54.612]  They say that one's not available to the population yet.
[01:36:55.813 --> 01:36:57.613]  Oh, yeah, they're going to test it on their own people.
[01:36:57.633 --> 01:37:07.115]  What I did hear in the beginning was that there was going to have three of them, and from one of the doctors that I talked to, they mentioned that this was his opinion.
[01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:10.616]  He said there wasn't going to have one that was going to turn the immune system off.
[01:37:11.818 --> 01:37:15.291]  And the second one would be the one in which they would... Alex, I just want to mention that, um...
[01:37:15.839 --> 01:37:28.443]  Dr. Horowitz, if you go visit his Fluscam.com site and you check under the vaccine package inserts link, it does list all of the documents from the pharmaceuticals with listing the ingredients and the warnings on them.
[01:37:28.723 --> 01:37:42.868]  Yes, and every single one of the vaccinations, we've got the package inserts now posted, freely downloadable on Fluscam.com, and you can see even the manufacturers are telling you all the warnings about it.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:49.163]  But then meanwhile, Reuters is saying there's no problem, and there's no adjuvants, there's no mercury.
[01:37:49.583 --> 01:37:51.003]  All lies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:51.364 --> 01:37:52.984]  So what are the employees saying?
[01:37:53.324 --> 01:37:56.186]  As you know, this stuff's in there, but the media is saying it's not in there.
[01:37:57.326 --> 01:38:07.491]  You know what, when we interviewed the other day in Safeway supermarket, we interviewed all the employees, and no one was going to take the vaccination.
[01:38:07.911 --> 01:38:12.553]  The pharmacist, like I said, had no clue whatsoever, and he wasn't going to take it.
[01:38:13.151 --> 01:38:18.856]  Yeah, they're just finding... but in closing, Marcus, what's the bottom line with people you're talking to?
[01:38:18.876 --> 01:38:20.578]  I mean, are your co-workers smelling a rat?
[01:38:21.538 --> 01:38:40.295]  Yes, they are, and I printed off the insert for one of them, the fluorine, and on a warning and precaution, it does mention the Guillain-Barré syndrome, and it says, on insert, if Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within six weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine,
[01:38:41.203 --> 01:38:45.452]  The decision to give Fluvorin should be based on careful consideration of the potential
[01:38:46.726 --> 01:38:49.269]  Yeah, we need to get that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:49.289 --> 01:38:52.571]  Do you have the Fluvorin posted up on FluScam, Dr. Horowitz?
[01:38:52.751 --> 01:38:53.612]  Yes, we do, Alex.
[01:38:53.692 --> 01:38:58.296]  Just connect to FluScam.com and you'll see the new page that's there.
[01:38:58.316 --> 01:38:58.756]  All right.
[01:38:58.876 --> 01:39:06.603]  I want to get Paul Watson to do a headline, Flu Vaccine Maker Admits Link to Gillian Beret, Which Killed Your Mother, Dr. Horowitz.
[01:39:06.623 --> 01:39:07.323]  Sorry to mention that.
[01:39:07.844 --> 01:39:08.544]  It's painful.
[01:39:09.045 --> 01:39:10.206]  We can save lives here.
[01:39:10.266 --> 01:39:13.629]  But again, then we need to show how they're hoaxing saying it doesn't.
[01:39:14.617 --> 01:39:19.969]  And I hear that Dr. Dina Dell every weekend on the radio saying that's not true and then the insert says it.
[01:39:21.601 --> 01:39:23.801]  But the insert itself is a fraud.
[01:39:24.122 --> 01:39:27.542]  Because you can't simply say at six weeks it's a cut-off.
[01:39:27.922 --> 01:39:41.024]  If you've ever had Guillain-Barre, it means that you have your system engaged with antigenic complexes and immune system sensitivities that are going to be aggravated hideously by these new injections.
[01:39:41.184 --> 01:39:42.165]  This is unbelievable.
[01:39:42.465 --> 01:39:43.545]  God bless you, Marcus.
[01:39:43.585 --> 01:39:44.645]  Stay in contact with us.
[01:39:44.685 --> 01:39:45.205]  Anything else?
[01:39:46.305 --> 01:39:48.566]  I have one more point that you mentioned about the microchips.
[01:39:48.766 --> 01:39:50.346]  With me working for Novartis also,
[01:39:51.622 --> 01:40:07.107]  No, they're saying they're going to make people, they're considering making you take a chip to prove you've had the flu shot.
[01:40:07.127 --> 01:40:08.027]  That's mainstream news.
[01:40:08.047 --> 01:40:09.328]  I mean, we're entering the twilight zone.
[01:40:09.588 --> 01:40:10.288]  Thank you, Marcus.
[01:40:10.688 --> 01:40:14.389]  Final caller, and then we've got other key flu and economic news coming up after the break.
[01:40:14.789 --> 01:40:16.550]  And then Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us as well.
[01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:19.291]  Charlene, New York medical worker, you're on the air.
[01:40:19.311 --> 01:40:19.911]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:20.632 --> 01:40:22.113]  Yeah, thanks for hitting me on Alex.
[01:40:22.193 --> 01:40:46.372]  I've been trying to call for a while now and I just wanted to really, as a person who's experienced great health most of my life, I swam every day, played tennis four hours at a time and was in perfect health, worked in the medical field and had a chance to unknowingly receive the hepatitis B immunization, the trifecta.
[01:40:47.073 --> 01:40:48.634]  After receiving the third shot,
[01:40:49.592 --> 01:40:59.515]  I moved to a different worksite, so three weeks later I was noticing some very photosensitivity.
[01:41:00.395 --> 01:41:04.956]  I was waking up in the morning and my head, it was really weird, it looked like a corpse.
[01:41:05.096 --> 01:41:07.057]  It looked like there was no blood.
[01:41:07.177 --> 01:41:09.577]  It wasn't like pretty and pale.
[01:41:09.757 --> 01:41:11.218]  It was like a corpse head.
[01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:15.059]  But I still had never heard of any kind of
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:16.700]  I don't know.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:33.543]  It's like being stuck in a Stephen King novel, and I'm not kidding.
[01:41:33.563 --> 01:41:36.145]  Well, they admit it causes the brain to swell.
[01:41:36.925 --> 01:41:37.646]  Dr. Horowitz?
[01:41:38.246 --> 01:41:45.632]  You know, the hepatitis B vaccine, just look at the documents in the affidavit on the hepatitis B vaccine.
[01:41:46.152 --> 01:41:52.317]  Give it to 12-hour-old infants whose immune systems aren't mature yet is absolute genocide.
[01:41:52.597 --> 01:41:55.498]  And we wonder why the kids are all dull and half-retarded now.
[01:41:55.998 --> 01:41:57.218]  It's soft kill weapons.
[01:41:57.278 --> 01:41:59.459]  Ma'am, call me back again with more.
[01:41:59.499 --> 01:42:00.399]  We're out of time.
[01:42:00.419 --> 01:42:05.220]  Charlene, because tomorrow we're going to open the phones up again for victims and other people.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:07.761]  God bless you, and I'm sorry that happened to you.
[01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:09.262]  That's why I want to warn people.
[01:42:09.542 --> 01:42:10.422]  We know!
[01:42:10.942 --> 01:42:11.783]  We know!
[01:42:11.843 --> 01:42:13.203]  And they just keep killing us!
[01:42:13.464 --> 01:42:15.245]  The Gardasil, they keep killing us!
[01:42:15.305 --> 01:42:16.105]  They're dying!
[01:42:16.145 --> 01:42:17.526]  They're becoming paralyzed!
[01:42:17.786 --> 01:42:22.509]  BlueScam.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, continue war room there.
[01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:26.492]  We'll have Dr. Horowitz and his investigative journalists.
[01:42:26.832 --> 01:42:27.792]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:46.357 --> 01:42:46.677]  Stay there.
[01:42:46.697 --> 01:42:47.618]  We're going to set you up again.
[01:42:47.899 --> 01:42:49.740]  We've got a bunch of other medical doctors coming up.
[01:42:50.101 --> 01:42:51.322]  We've got Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:42:51.602 --> 01:42:52.743]  We've got Dr. Blaylock.
[01:42:53.284 --> 01:42:56.007]  We've got Stan Monteith, the doctor, coming on.
[01:42:56.067 --> 01:42:57.368]  Dr. Ron Paul this week.
[01:42:57.648 --> 01:42:58.509]  Total coverage.
[01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:59.350]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:00.171]  More straight ahead.
[01:43:00.231 --> 01:43:00.852]  Key info.
[01:43:01.212 --> 01:43:04.155]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.184]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:43:08.465 --> 01:43:11.929]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:19.718]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:43:21.203 --> 01:43:27.068]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[01:44:07.627 --> 01:44:09.568]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:44:09.948 --> 01:44:17.592]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:44:18.272 --> 01:44:25.335]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:44:25.716 --> 01:44:32.579]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:44:33.095 --> 01:44:37.196]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:44:37.456 --> 01:44:40.996]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:44:41.417 --> 01:44:43.357]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:47.618]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:45:31.494 --> 01:45:32.515]  Garden in a Can.

[01:45:36.518 --> 01:45:40.480]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[01:46:04.025 --> 01:46:06.466]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:46:07.026 --> 01:46:09.827]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:46:10.307 --> 01:46:17.870]  That's right, it is documented as we wage war on corruption, crash of the lies and disinformation for about two segments.
[01:46:17.890 --> 01:46:19.931]  In the next hour, we've got Dr. Jerome Corsi on.
[01:46:19.951 --> 01:46:32.076]  I'm going to get his take on the flu, but separately on what's happening to the economy and Google and others with systems, these smart thermostats to track everything you're doing basically on your power grid in your home.
[01:46:32.947 --> 01:46:33.888]  So we're going to get some into that.
[01:46:33.928 --> 01:46:39.153]  We're going to continue in the last half hour to take your whistleblower calls about forced inoculations, troop movements.
[01:46:39.173 --> 01:46:43.176]  I have a video clip of troops running checkpoints in Arizona against citizens.
[01:46:43.236 --> 01:46:46.319]  It's all starting to happen as they just ratchet it up incrementally.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:48.061]  Here's a Reuters headline.
[01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:50.203]  Gold climbs towards 18-month high.
[01:46:50.943 --> 01:46:51.784]  Eyes on Fed.
[01:46:52.805 --> 01:46:55.968]  And gold is at $1,019 and climbing.
[01:46:56.748 --> 01:47:06.576]  And we have Ted Anderson joining us because Ted Anderson bought gold again when it was a lot lower than it is now, and he can sell you gold and silver at a price much lower than it is right now.
[01:47:07.277 --> 01:47:11.039]  You can't beat that in this market when most people can't even get their hands on gold and silver now.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.401]  A lot of the brokers are running out.
[01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:14.582]  Ted Anderson, Midas Resources.
[01:47:14.602 --> 01:47:15.323]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:47:15.623 --> 01:47:17.024]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:47:17.064 --> 01:47:19.805]  Boy, I can tell you it's getting tough to buy it in the dips right now.
[01:47:19.845 --> 01:47:26.009]  I had about maybe an hour and a half to two hours to lock things in when gold was at $9.95 here just yesterday.
[01:47:28.723 --> 01:47:33.267]  And now it's jumped right up to $1,020, and it's getting tough.
[01:47:33.327 --> 01:47:35.709]  I mean, India right now is buying gold like crazy.
[01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:36.690]  The Chinese are.
[01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:42.414]  There is a lot of demand in this marketplace, not just here in the United States, but in the world.
[01:47:42.494 --> 01:47:47.338]  And mostly you'll see that reflected in the prices when the Asian markets open up while we're sleeping.
[01:47:47.679 --> 01:47:51.622]  Every now and then we have this dip here because the Fed's in there trying to push the prices down.
[01:47:52.042 --> 01:47:55.365]  And then you watch the European market and the Asian markets.
[01:47:57.987 --> 01:48:10.182]  Well, this is like being able to buy Google or IBM stock when it's at 100 and then it goes up to 130 or 150 and you're still selling the stock for the lower price.
[01:48:10.242 --> 01:48:12.184]  People cannot beat this deal.
[01:48:14.565 --> 01:48:17.286]  Gold's more than doubled in the last five years.
[01:48:17.666 --> 01:48:19.186]  It's over 20% gain a year.
[01:48:19.246 --> 01:48:19.646]  What is it?
[01:48:20.186 --> 01:48:22.467]  Yeah, it's running right in at that 20% level.
[01:48:22.507 --> 01:48:25.868]  Because you've got to remember, we go back down to about 245 gold.
[01:48:26.468 --> 01:48:28.428]  And yeah, gold has really done well.
[01:48:28.548 --> 01:48:29.188]  So has silver.
[01:48:29.308 --> 01:48:29.869]  Well, wait.
[01:48:30.009 --> 01:48:34.650]  Wait, if it was 245 then, and now it's up to over 1,000, that's more than a doubling.
[01:48:34.670 --> 01:48:35.610]  That's a tripling?
[01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.550]  Quadrupling?
[01:48:36.570 --> 01:48:39.851]  Yeah, quadrupling from the lowest point in the marketplace.
[01:48:40.233 --> 01:48:41.774]  You know, it's hard to hit those points.
[01:48:42.174 --> 01:48:51.000]  And like I said, I mean, to be able to buy in these dips right now when you only have little tiny opportunities, usually have a day or two, I don't even get that anymore.
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:54.042]  It's like an hour, it'll come down, and boom, it's right back up again.
[01:48:54.102 --> 01:48:55.103]  And it's strong.
[01:48:55.223 --> 01:48:56.964]  I expect to see gold go up further.
[01:48:57.665 --> 01:48:58.605]  It's breaking forward.
[01:48:58.645 --> 01:49:02.528]  If you're a technician, you can see what's going on in the marketplace.
[01:49:02.608 --> 01:49:06.251]  It's hitting this resistance level and heading right back on up again.
[01:49:06.291 --> 01:49:08.552]  It looks like a W on a chart, which is what
[01:49:09.974 --> 01:49:12.359]  You know, it's an indication that we're going to break forward.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.250]  You know, Bob Chapman was mentioning that on a show I was on with him just yesterday.
[01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:19.831]  And I've been following the same thing.
[01:49:19.871 --> 01:49:24.474]  If you follow Robert Proctor, and you're a technician at all, you can see what's going on with gold.
[01:49:24.494 --> 01:49:28.536]  Well, Ted, tell people the gold and silver you've got at the below market price.
[01:49:28.716 --> 01:49:33.238]  Well, the best things that I have right now still are the Walking Liberty halves at $8.69.
[01:49:33.318 --> 01:49:34.139]  Silver trading around $17.
[01:49:34.519 --> 01:49:35.800]  That's a steal.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.721]  That's like buying Walking Liberty halves at the junk price.
[01:49:39.242 --> 01:49:41.363]  And then the $10 Liberty right now at $8.18.
[01:49:41.403 --> 01:49:44.685]  Roughly about $150 more if I buy them back in the marketplace right now.
[01:49:47.862 --> 01:49:52.804]  And seriously, I mean, if you're looking at the Franks or the British Sovereigns, they're at a good buy, too.
[01:49:53.224 --> 01:49:55.746]  But those two coins, without a question, hands down.
[01:49:56.006 --> 01:49:57.626]  Well, where is Crazy Eddie when you need him?
[01:49:57.646 --> 01:50:00.027]  I mean, I should be yelling and screaming and saying, incredible deal.
[01:50:00.087 --> 01:50:01.408]  It is such an amazing deal.
[01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:04.209]  We're just going to calmly let you know that price is there.
[01:50:04.569 --> 01:50:05.670]  Tell folks about the silver.
[01:50:06.092 --> 01:50:09.553]  Yeah, the silver right now, the best thing to buy is that Walking Liberty half.
[01:50:09.633 --> 01:50:10.434]  It's $8.69.
[01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:13.675]  If you like those Lakota coins, they're going to be jumping up too.
[01:50:13.715 --> 01:50:14.615]  They're at $22.30.
[01:50:14.955 --> 01:50:19.136]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:50:19.177 --> 01:50:20.237]  We'll have all that for you.
[01:50:20.257 --> 01:50:23.038]  But mention you heard it on the Alex Jones Show, please.
[01:50:24.445 --> 01:50:24.485]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:26.326 --> 01:50:30.349]  If you don't tell them you heard it on this radio show today, Ted is selling gold at a higher price.
[01:50:30.369 --> 01:50:32.650]  This is a special for our listeners only.
[01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:32.930]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:37.753]  Dr. Jerome Kors, he's coming up in five minutes.
[01:50:38.033 --> 01:50:39.734]  I want to talk to you more about the market, Ted.
[01:50:39.754 --> 01:50:40.194]  Stay with us.
[01:50:40.214 --> 01:50:40.835]  Back in one minute.

[01:51:12.927 --> 01:51:15.990]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:51:16.570 --> 01:51:20.974]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.

[01:51:40.106 --> 01:51:40.146]  877-327-0365.
[01:51:40.166 --> 01:51:40.766]  Don't wait.
[01:51:40.846 --> 01:51:41.387]  Call today.
[01:51:41.467 --> 01:51:42.487]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:42.507 --> 01:51:43.788]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:09.164 --> 01:52:11.685]  Ted Anderson's our guest for the next five minutes.
[01:52:11.865 --> 01:52:14.466]  Then Dr. Jerome Corsi on a host of important issues.
[01:52:15.066 --> 01:52:15.787]  The economy.
[01:52:15.807 --> 01:52:17.147]  Got a doctorate in that.
[01:52:18.468 --> 01:52:19.328]  His take on the flu.
[01:52:19.368 --> 01:52:20.188]  I don't know his view on it.
[01:52:20.228 --> 01:52:20.609]  We'll get it.
[01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:23.690]  I would imagine it's similar to ours from the research.
[01:52:25.171 --> 01:52:29.013]  And what's happening with Google and others wanting to track everything you do inside your home.
[01:52:29.473 --> 01:52:30.554]  That is coming up.
[01:52:30.614 --> 01:52:38.357]  In fact, did you guys print me that article of Watson's story three years ago about Google wanting to use the cameras and microphone in your computer to watch and track you?
[01:52:39.118 --> 01:52:39.798]  We can't find that.
[01:52:40.098 --> 01:52:42.880]  Get Watson to... I know you gave it to us.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.901]  I got the stack here on the tracking in the home.
[01:52:45.961 --> 01:52:46.641]  I just need that one.
[01:52:48.382 --> 01:52:49.383]  Going back to Ted Anderson.
[01:52:49.423 --> 01:52:51.384]  Ted, you've been in the gold and silver business for 30 years.
[01:52:52.044 --> 01:52:53.285]  You've had Midas Resources for 12.
[01:52:55.237 --> 01:52:58.539]  I mean, we knew in the fall gold would go up.
[01:52:58.579 --> 01:52:59.339]  We told everybody that.
[01:52:59.359 --> 01:53:00.600]  I mean, that's what the smart money was on.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.541]  The dollar's plunging.
[01:53:02.601 --> 01:53:07.083]  The world is talking about all the overprinting of money and issuance of currency and credit to the central banks.
[01:53:07.363 --> 01:53:12.705]  They're telling us we're going to have the first jobless recovery, a booming economy where you're homeless, because the banks are doing well.
[01:53:12.725 --> 01:53:14.266]  That's the only gauge in the economy now.
[01:53:14.526 --> 01:53:15.987]  Thanks to their heist, they're doing well.
[01:53:16.407 --> 01:53:17.908]  A $23.7 trillion in the U.S.
[01:53:17.968 --> 01:53:19.989]  alone of taxpayer money the last 11 months.
[01:53:21.186 --> 01:53:23.448]  What's really going on at this particular time?
[01:53:23.468 --> 01:53:24.209]  You said it like you did.
[01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:28.614]  We're in the time of the year where gold and silver does better, as a historical fact.
[01:53:37.466 --> 01:53:39.888]  And right now, we're at the beginning of it and not the end of it.
[01:53:39.968 --> 01:53:41.969]  We've just about reached the gold peak.
[01:53:42.249 --> 01:53:47.012]  That's, you know, the highest price that's ever been seen, which is $1,030.80.
[01:53:48.453 --> 01:53:51.875]  When we break through that level, gold is going to see a new trading range.
[01:53:51.895 --> 01:53:56.098]  We'll probably be seeing that $1,016 level, and then we'll be bouncing down.
[01:53:56.458 --> 01:54:00.340]  Maybe we'll get lucky, and we'll be able to buy gold at about $1,050 on the dip.
[01:54:02.165 --> 01:54:03.806]  And so this momentum is building.
[01:54:03.826 --> 01:54:05.507]  You can see it in the charts and graphs.
[01:54:06.067 --> 01:54:10.209]  With India, I mean, every time, this time of year, they're always buying gold.
[01:54:10.269 --> 01:54:11.690]  This is their wedding season.
[01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:15.572]  It's part of the dowry to have gold for the women when they get married.
[01:54:16.072 --> 01:54:20.355]  In the springtime, they always sell to buy their seed for their farms.
[01:54:20.675 --> 01:54:23.256]  It's just timing-wise in the marketplace.
[01:54:23.536 --> 01:54:28.819]  But you compound this issue with all the money that's been printed by the Fed and issued into the banks
[01:54:29.059 --> 01:54:29.419]  I think?
[01:54:49.512 --> 01:54:50.313]  The U.S.
[01:54:50.373 --> 01:54:52.515]  Treasury bonds, notes and bills and cash.
[01:54:52.995 --> 01:54:55.197]  All that money comes back to the United States.
[01:54:55.598 --> 01:54:56.298]  We're toast.
[01:54:56.378 --> 01:55:00.362]  We're going to be in worse shape than Argentina was when they failed.
[01:55:00.382 --> 01:55:05.046]  I mean, the United States has been on a credit binge and still is.
[01:55:05.126 --> 01:55:14.535]  Every time the government turns around and has a problem, they want to print money, which means that the United States has to borrow money directly from the Fed through the open market operation.
[01:55:15.055 --> 01:55:19.017]  And that means more money coming into the system, and it means a loss of purchasing power.
[01:55:19.377 --> 01:55:21.297]  And gold prices are reflecting that.
[01:55:21.617 --> 01:55:26.419]  And you can see the Fed trying to step in and manipulate the market and bring the price down.
[01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:33.582]  If you want to know more about that, all you have to do is go to gata.org, G-A-T-A dot org, and you can find out more on that.
[01:55:34.382 --> 01:55:54.934]  I can just tell you right now, Alex, there's so much manipulation going on in the marketplace, but the Fed and its operations are losing the battle, and the value of the currency is going to be lost in the math of it, and unfortunately, the people of the United States are going to lose a lot of purchasing power, whether if it's in the stocks,
[01:55:55.414 --> 01:55:56.095]  Bond market.
[01:55:56.456 --> 01:55:57.577]  You're sitting in annuities.
[01:55:57.637 --> 01:55:58.678]  It doesn't matter what you're holding.
[01:55:58.698 --> 01:56:06.607]  And what's going to happen is, as the yuppies that laugh at us finally, and it's starting to happen, rush in and start buying gold and silver as it goes up, that's going to make it even harder to get.
[01:56:06.667 --> 01:56:08.670]  You've now come to the point where it's hard for you to get it.
[01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:09.591]  You've got it in stock.
[01:56:10.071 --> 01:56:12.774]  Silver and gold way below what it's currently selling for.
[01:56:13.095 --> 01:56:15.898]  How long can you hold that deal you made in the last segment?
[01:56:16.118 --> 01:56:23.460]  Well, this one here I'm going to hold until midnight and if I'm lucky, if I'm really lucky, we'll get another dip and I can buy again and still keep the prices low.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.521]  But it's getting to be more difficult.
[01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:29.482]  Like I said, Alex, I had about a two-hour window here to pick up things at that $9.94.
[01:56:29.802 --> 01:56:34.163]  And you're selling it in the market right now at that one, Gold's Above $1,020.
[01:56:35.964 --> 01:56:36.124]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:36.244 --> 01:56:41.969]  The brokers will be there till midnight Central Standard Time tonight.
[01:56:42.089 --> 01:56:42.630]  Don't wait.
[01:56:43.150 --> 01:56:47.174]  The deal ends at midnight tonight.
[01:56:47.194 --> 01:56:47.814]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:49.336 --> 01:56:52.879]  Midas Resources, the owner of the GCN Radio Network, the best deal out there.
[01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:53.659]  Ted Anderson, 800-686-2237.
[01:56:53.759 --> 01:56:58.844]  Tell him Alex Jones sent you to get that or you'll pay more.
[01:56:59.044 --> 01:56:59.705]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:01.277 --> 01:57:03.879]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:04.279 --> 01:57:09.242]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:09.603 --> 01:57:11.344]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:11.664 --> 01:57:16.467]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:16.667 --> 01:57:17.628]  How much do you want?
[01:57:17.848 --> 01:57:18.588]  When do you want it?
[01:57:18.969 --> 01:57:20.570]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:57:20.850 --> 01:57:21.671]  When will you need it?
[01:57:21.931 --> 01:57:23.992]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:24.132 --> 01:57:25.233]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:25.473 --> 01:57:26.774]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:26.994 --> 01:57:32.059]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:35.463]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:35.843 --> 01:57:39.327]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:39.648 --> 01:57:40.649]  How much will you need?
[01:57:40.889 --> 01:57:41.490]  We don't know.
[01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:42.711]  How much do you want?
[01:57:42.891 --> 01:57:43.612]  All you can get.
[01:57:43.632 --> 01:57:44.633]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:44.893 --> 01:57:45.113]  I think.
[01:58:00.342 --> 01:58:05.528]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:05.648 --> 01:58:10.033]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:58:10.193 --> 01:58:12.035]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:58:12.456 --> 01:58:13.797]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:58:14.078 --> 01:58:15.119]  There is a solution.
[01:58:15.339 --> 01:58:23.366]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:59:01.215 --> 01:59:01.915]  Hello, friends.
[01:59:01.955 --> 01:59:04.957]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[01:59:05.077 --> 01:59:14.943]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[01:59:15.263 --> 01:59:18.945]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:19.185 --> 01:59:20.946]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:59:21.147 --> 01:59:24.629]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[01:59:24.969 --> 01:59:27.110]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:32.714]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[01:59:57.724 --> 01:59:59.328]  You will never use anything else again.
[02:00:02.483 --> 02:00:08.504]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:09.104 --> 02:00:12.145]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.625 --> 02:00:20.287]  That's right, coming to you by corporate occupied territory, the global corporate takeover of the United States, the entire planet, known as the New World Order, is moving quickly.
[02:00:20.307 --> 02:00:24.968]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to break down all these mainstream articles calling for a world government, world taxes.
[02:00:25.328 --> 02:00:29.489]  Meanwhile, the George Soros publications are saying we're liars, none of this exists.
[02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:35.733]  Using a military tactic of stalling, so we just argue about whether or not it exists, rather than whether we want it or not.
[02:00:35.753 --> 02:00:47.280]  Dr. Jerome Corsi received a PhD from Harvard University in political science in 72, and has written many best-selling books, including the number one New York Times bestseller, Unfit for Command, Swift Boat, Veterans Speak Out Against Kerry.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:54.204]  His latest bestseller was the late great USA that we sell, by the way, the latest edition on InfoWars.com, The Coming Merger of Mexico-Canada.
[02:00:54.484 --> 02:00:56.345]  He's a senior staff reporter for WorldNetDaily.
[02:00:56.365 --> 02:00:57.026]  He's also written
[02:00:57.706 --> 02:01:00.047]  Uh, for human events and other big publications.
[02:01:00.367 --> 02:01:01.928]  His newest book is America for Sale.
[02:01:01.948 --> 02:01:03.689]  We'll have him back on the next few weeks about that.
[02:01:04.389 --> 02:01:06.110]  Uh, Dr. Corsi, I got a host of issues.
[02:01:06.150 --> 02:01:09.211]  The flu, Google, and these smart thermostats.
[02:01:09.251 --> 02:01:11.372]  California putting in another system that tracks.
[02:01:11.732 --> 02:01:12.613]  Texas putting them in.
[02:01:12.653 --> 02:01:13.793]  We have one here at the office.
[02:01:14.154 --> 02:01:16.254]  It can tell what we're using, what we're doing.
[02:01:16.695 --> 02:01:17.695]  Total surveillance.
[02:01:18.616 --> 02:01:21.077]  But I wanted to throw this out at you while I have you.
[02:01:22.037 --> 02:01:27.441]  I consulted on a new film, Camp FEMA, that just came out that we have at InfoWars.com, and I'm in it.
[02:01:27.782 --> 02:01:34.207]  It has the FEMA documents, the legislation, the emergency management plans, the continuity of government, the whole system.
[02:01:34.867 --> 02:01:45.996]  And Glenn Beck, who I know you've been on the Fox News shows, I'm not getting you here to bash, and he's a big leader in the Patriot movement and exposing a lot of things that are important like the government health care, but he's had popular mechanics on.
[02:01:46.536 --> 02:01:49.298]  Well, I don't have the articles in front of me right now, Alex, but I have documented
[02:02:14.369 --> 02:02:20.051]  Contracts from the Department of Homeland Security to build a temporary detention camp.
[02:02:20.971 --> 02:02:24.452]  These have been in effect since the Bush Administration.
[02:02:25.112 --> 02:02:37.836]  I continue to be concerned that under the idea of protecting us in natural disasters like Katrina, the government is gaining powers which could be used in the event of civil disorder.
[02:02:39.097 --> 02:02:40.597]  I lived through the 1970s.
[02:02:40.677 --> 02:02:42.958]  I did a lot of reporting, even when I was
[02:02:43.993 --> 02:02:55.859]  Working for research institutes and academics, going back to the 1970s, about the detention camps that were used in protests like the May Day protest in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:56.539 --> 02:03:04.724]  I did a lot of research on Captain Sanders, who was head of the Washington, D.C.
[02:03:04.764 --> 02:03:05.504]  Police Force.
[02:03:06.244 --> 02:03:13.108]  So there's been a lot of history in the United States, and it's not all been good, of utilizing detention camps, going back to the
[02:03:13.737 --> 02:03:16.038]  Japanese detention camps in World War II.
[02:03:16.759 --> 02:03:35.568]  I think any attempt to just poo-poo the effort, for instance, I reported on the National Homeland Security Directive that President Bush signed, which gave him authority to declare that the office of the President was in charge of all levels of government, down to tribal government.
[02:03:36.309 --> 02:03:42.232]  And the declaration, the self-declaration by the President of the National Emergency, very broadly defined.
[02:03:42.984 --> 02:03:51.546]  Which could include, again, not just natural disasters or health disasters, but it could include a variety of civil protest situations.
[02:03:52.246 --> 02:03:54.847]  And now they're using the Army to spy on in the Fed protests.
[02:03:54.867 --> 02:03:56.067]  That's been declassified.
[02:03:56.387 --> 02:04:00.308]  Now the Army wants 379,000 troops in America.
[02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:03.409]  Well, I've also reported extensively on U.S.
[02:04:03.489 --> 02:04:09.911]  NORTHCOM and its mission to be a military presence in civil emergency situations.
[02:04:10.563 --> 02:04:12.324]  And Alex, these things are always very difficult.
[02:04:12.364 --> 02:04:17.908]  They're presented as if this is, you know, the United States government trying to assist the citizens.
[02:04:18.688 --> 02:04:28.134]  And there can be legitimate but limited roles for the federal government and even the military to play in natural hazards or other national emergencies.
[02:04:28.314 --> 02:04:30.015]  But what about the Arcadia drill?
[02:04:30.215 --> 02:04:33.697]  What about the Arcadia drill in Iowa this year for gun confiscation?
[02:04:33.877 --> 02:04:35.318]  These are very fine lines.
[02:04:35.358 --> 02:04:39.581]  They very easily cross over into violations of civil liberties.
[02:04:40.337 --> 02:04:45.818]  On disrespect for the fundamental, aggressive rights of protest that we have under the First Amendment.
[02:04:46.458 --> 02:04:49.919]  So I'm always very concerned about these, Alex, and the powers exist.
[02:04:50.579 --> 02:04:56.720]  There are presidential directives which could be used to exert martial law.
[02:04:57.641 --> 02:05:02.062]  There are powers to create temporary camps which could be used to create detention camps.
[02:05:02.742 --> 02:05:08.483]  And I think it's important and responsible for people like yourself, for us at WorldNetDaily,
[02:05:09.178 --> 02:05:18.006]  Keep reporting of these issues so the American people are aware of a potential expansion of government power that would be completely antagonistic to the First Amendment.
[02:05:18.578 --> 02:05:28.963]  Well, sir, just so you know, from Texas to Arizona to Michigan to California, regular Army, regular Marines, and National Guard, and in Tennessee three months ago, we had the state rep on.
[02:05:29.603 --> 02:05:32.464]  The Army was running checkpoints with Homeland Security in Tennessee.
[02:05:32.504 --> 02:05:34.765]  The governor said, don't do it, and the Army ignored them.
[02:05:35.205 --> 02:05:44.389]  I'm playing a YouTube video sent to us from just a few days ago of National Guard troops in the middle of Arizona out searching people's cars.
[02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:46.910]  And I'd like to see this new film you created.
[02:05:46.990 --> 02:05:47.991]  I haven't seen this one.
[02:05:48.743 --> 02:05:53.164]  I've seen most of your previous films, and I enjoy them, and I think they're well done.
[02:05:53.204 --> 02:05:54.205]  I want to see this new one.
[02:05:55.485 --> 02:05:59.466]  Well, I want to get into some other subjects with you, like the big report you've got at World Net Daily today.
[02:05:59.547 --> 02:05:59.747]  Yeah.
[02:05:59.847 --> 02:06:02.647]  Also, Christian Science Monitor, coming soon.
[02:06:02.768 --> 02:06:06.589]  Google your electricity use, tracking everything going on in your home.
[02:06:09.252 --> 02:06:17.179]  Also, your article, Get Ready, Here Come the Energy Police, Google Power Meter, could mean regulation of your private home, and we're going to go over these.
[02:06:17.239 --> 02:06:22.924]  Google.org is partnered with EPB, JEA, Reliance Energy, SDGE,
[02:06:25.185 --> 02:06:39.055]  Simpra Energy, Toronto Hydro, TXU, White River Electric Cooperative, WPS Wisconsin, Yellow Storm, it goes on and on, ITRON, and then I have the other articles here.
[02:06:40.155 --> 02:06:42.697]  Out of California, where they're making people take these.
[02:06:42.737 --> 02:06:45.880]  They came and put it on our business a few months ago here in Austin.
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:49.262]  On our company thing, didn't even ask, they just put it in.
[02:06:49.782 --> 02:06:51.644]  And they admit it tracks everything we're doing.
[02:06:51.884 --> 02:06:55.807]  Well, again, what this is, is what's called a Google Power Meter.
[02:06:56.487 --> 02:07:02.191]  And it's an internet-based technology that measures your use of energy.
[02:07:03.012 --> 02:07:05.554]  And of course, Google, all these things come presenting as
[02:07:06.212 --> 02:07:08.833]  Presenting themselves as a great favor to you.
[02:07:08.873 --> 02:07:14.714]  Google says, well, when you go to the grocery store, you get an itemized list of the groceries you bought.
[02:07:14.794 --> 02:07:26.116]  Why should you just get an energy bill at the end of the month for the energy company without itemizing your use of power by specific refrigerator, air conditioning, heater, etc.
[02:07:26.477 --> 02:07:27.777]  And they mentioned carbon tax.
[02:07:27.797 --> 02:07:29.417]  This is getting us ready for carbon audits.
[02:07:29.637 --> 02:07:32.798]  All of this sounds great, but what happens on this, Alex, is
[02:07:33.388 --> 02:07:41.214]  It sets up the basis for the government, then, to have standards, where they say, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, you're using too much energy.
[02:07:41.914 --> 02:08:01.309]  And when you combine it, as I have with the census reporting that's being planned, including the census survey that's going to be taken out of sample of the American people, where the government's going to know exactly who's in your home, what education they've got, what languages they speak, what nationality they are, how much money they make, etc.
[02:08:02.378 --> 02:08:13.646]  It's very conceivable that this energy meter then becomes the energy police, and Google provides the government with the data to say, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Jones or Mr. Corsi, your home is too big.
[02:08:14.367 --> 02:08:23.033]  You know, you've got to pay a surcharge because you've got these additional rooms, unless you, of course, you want to maybe move in a poor family and house them.
[02:08:23.774 --> 02:08:29.578]  Or, and by the way, your refrigerator's a little bit old, and we don't think you had proper insulation in your home.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.661]  And they say if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.
[02:08:32.681 --> 02:08:42.183]  They're admitting this is part of the new climate change bill with these home inspections where the feds can evict you anytime they want if you don't, quote, comply with federal international zoning.
[02:08:42.643 --> 02:08:44.483]  And what they're saying is it's E.T.
[02:08:44.523 --> 02:08:45.523]  meets I.T.
[02:08:45.563 --> 02:08:51.945]  In other words, energy technology meeting internet technology, information technology.
[02:08:52.645 --> 02:08:58.626]  And it's being beta tested by Google, not just in the United States, but in India, Germany, Canada.
[02:08:59.178 --> 02:09:21.767]  Google intends this to be a global standard, so we've got more one-world order of vision here, saying that our energy use, our carbon emission footprint, all of these things can be measured, controlled, regulated by the government with new standards that are fundamentally anti-free enterprise.
[02:09:22.087 --> 02:09:25.568]  Right now, if you use energy and you pay for it,
[02:09:26.144 --> 02:09:29.585]  You have a right to buy the energy being sold to you by the utility.
[02:09:29.725 --> 02:09:30.665]  And again, they brag.
[02:09:30.725 --> 02:09:32.966]  Enron came up with this idea more than 12 years ago.
[02:09:33.006 --> 02:09:43.029]  They brag, just like with artificial scarcity with water or diamonds or oil, they will restrict it, make you cut back on what you're using, and then just charge you more for less.
[02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:44.390]  It's a total scam.
[02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:48.651]  Well, and again, people have got to be aware of the power of the government in these situations.
[02:09:48.711 --> 02:09:53.953]  Look at the farmers out in Southern California, where the government is cutting off their water to protect
[02:09:54.659 --> 02:09:57.581]  Some environmental creature that they don't want to go extinct.
[02:09:58.882 --> 02:10:03.826]  But this also sets the precedent, as you write in your article, that Google is hooked into your house.
[02:10:04.367 --> 02:10:07.629]  It's got algorithms that can tell when you're using the washing machine, the toaster.
[02:10:07.649 --> 02:10:08.510]  They admit this.
[02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:11.172]  They're now going to be itemizing what you're doing.
[02:10:11.212 --> 02:10:11.953]  What you're doing?
[02:10:12.353 --> 02:10:14.214]  This is the equivalent of cameras in the house.
[02:10:14.535 --> 02:10:22.741]  They can tell when you're using your television, when you're using your washer and dryer, when you're using your dishwasher, when you're using your air conditioner.
[02:10:23.308 --> 02:10:33.690]  They can measure whether or not this meets... So it's a complete monitoring... And they're already saying if you're an energy waster, or like in Austin, they charge you more if you use a lot of water, they're going to penalize you.
[02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:35.331]  They're surveilling you.
[02:10:35.351 --> 02:10:36.351]  This is Big Brother.
[02:10:36.551 --> 02:10:40.452]  This is a monitoring of what goes on inside your home.
[02:10:40.992 --> 02:10:51.154]  Your daily activities, measured in terms of energy, with a government regulation that could either say you're violating some law how you're using energy,
[02:10:51.673 --> 02:11:10.224]  Or you're going to have a surcharge placed on you, or under these new public welfare definitions that have, for instance, allowed expanded power as an eminent domain, the government's either going to move a family in with you, or they're going to restrict your ability to use the entire house the way you want to use it.
[02:11:10.678 --> 02:11:11.718]  And this is all stated.
[02:11:11.778 --> 02:11:13.339]  This is not our opinion.
[02:11:13.379 --> 02:11:17.780]  It's like they deny death panels, but then Newsweek comes out and says the case for killing Granny.
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:24.882]  And that's a psych warfare tactic, as you know, Dr. Corsi, where they announce they're going to do it, and then deny they're doing it.
[02:11:24.962 --> 02:11:30.863]  Or Obama has his surrogates say any criticism of him is racism, then he comes out and says, oh, that's not true.
[02:11:31.163 --> 02:11:32.403]  He plays the part of the good cop.
[02:11:32.603 --> 02:11:38.745]  Well, and just like the government regulates efficiency standards on cars and trucks, they're aiming to do it in your home.
[02:11:41.155 --> 02:11:47.782]  Well, of course, TiVo watches what you watch and creates a psychological algorithm and profile.
[02:11:48.142 --> 02:11:53.768]  And Google announced three years ago government industry to use computer microphones to spout 150 million Americans.
[02:11:54.388 --> 02:11:55.589]  Google's already doing that.
[02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:57.011]  I mean, this is Big Brother.
[02:11:57.411 --> 02:11:57.872]  Exactly.
[02:11:57.892 --> 02:11:58.172]  Stay there.
[02:11:58.212 --> 02:11:58.613]  Stay there.
[02:11:58.693 --> 02:11:59.073]  Stay there, Dr.
[02:12:01.072 --> 02:12:03.094]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:12:03.254 --> 02:12:04.015]  Spy on me?
[02:12:04.115 --> 02:12:04.395]  Yeah.
[02:12:04.435 --> 02:12:09.339]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:12:09.479 --> 02:12:10.940]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:12:11.121 --> 02:12:11.761]  Startpage?
[02:12:11.861 --> 02:12:12.202]  Yeah.
[02:12:12.282 --> 02:12:13.262]  Startpage.com.
[02:12:13.363 --> 02:12:16.185]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:12:16.345 --> 02:12:20.048]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:12:20.208 --> 02:12:23.011]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:12:23.331 --> 02:12:25.672]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:12:25.952 --> 02:12:27.433]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:12:27.533 --> 02:12:27.773]  Right!
[02:12:27.833 --> 02:12:30.855]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:12:31.155 --> 02:12:31.695]  Hello, folks.
[02:12:31.735 --> 02:12:32.695]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:12:33.076 --> 02:12:36.617]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:12:36.937 --> 02:12:40.559]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:12:55.309 --> 02:12:56.490]  That's StartPage.com
[02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:02.053]  Good day.
[02:13:02.233 --> 02:13:03.814]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:13:04.014 --> 02:13:04.354]  September 22, 2009.
[02:13:04.414 --> 02:13:05.595]  Gold opened this morning at $1,016.10.
[02:13:05.635 --> 02:13:09.157]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1,044.58, $522.29 for a half-ounce, or $261.15 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:13:09.217 --> 02:13:09.857]  That's $1,044.58, $522.29, and $261.15.
[02:13:23.137 --> 02:13:26.539]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources with an exciting announcement.
[02:13:26.919 --> 02:13:40.668]  Friday, September 25th at 7 p.m., two of the most influential representatives in Congress, Ron Paul and Michelle Bachman, are putting on a student town hall meeting, free to the public, at Northrop Auditorium University campus.
[02:13:40.948 --> 02:13:46.392]  The topics of this rare event will be monetary reform, limited government, and free market economy.
[02:13:46.512 --> 02:13:48.233]  Don't miss this powerful gathering.
[02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:52.717]  Again, dates for this event is Friday, September 25th at 7 p.m.
[02:13:52.838 --> 02:13:58.764]  Northrop U of M campus or go to www.mitusresources.com for more information.
[02:14:01.235 --> 02:14:03.276]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:14:03.396 --> 02:14:05.797]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:14:05.817 --> 02:14:08.379]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:14:08.399 --> 02:14:09.619]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:14:09.639 --> 02:14:11.260]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.181]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:14:14.222 --> 02:14:17.883]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:32.409]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:14:36.178 --> 02:14:37.259]  How dare you?
[02:14:38.819 --> 02:14:43.681]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:14:43.701 --> 02:14:46.502]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:14:46.582 --> 02:14:53.025]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[02:14:53.065 --> 02:14:55.646]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:14:55.926 --> 02:14:57.907]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:14:58.167 --> 02:15:00.628]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:15:01.218 --> 02:15:04.380]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:06.481]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:15:06.662 --> 02:15:12.005]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:15:12.205 --> 02:15:19.950]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[02:15:52.683 --> 02:15:53.985]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:08.501]  The UN brags, these big corporations brag, they're going to charge you more for water, energy, everything.
[02:16:09.161 --> 02:16:12.582]  They're creating mega-monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies.
[02:16:12.602 --> 02:16:16.063]  Dr. Corsi, in the five minutes we've got left, this is widespread.
[02:16:16.103 --> 02:16:19.464]  It's not just Google, but they're the big global player, as you write in WorldNetDaily.
[02:16:19.904 --> 02:16:21.944]  Christian Science Monitor is saying how great it is.
[02:16:22.684 --> 02:16:28.546]  They're just doing this, and they explain that this computer system, through the electrical grid,
[02:16:29.446 --> 02:16:31.447]  He is going to be tracking everything you do.
[02:16:31.527 --> 02:16:35.029]  I mean, this is a total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:16:35.049 --> 02:16:38.270]  A total Trojan horse of Big Brother Panopticon.
[02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:42.072]  It's a home invasion by the federal government, ultimately.
[02:16:42.492 --> 02:16:55.978]  And state governments, if they want to participate, into your home with Google providing the technology for the government to measure all your activities based on how much energy you're using and what type of energy you're using.
[02:16:56.018 --> 02:16:58.159]  Down to, is your television on?
[02:16:58.735 --> 02:16:59.735]  Is your stereo on?
[02:16:59.775 --> 02:17:00.855]  Is your computer on?
[02:17:01.436 --> 02:17:02.796]  Are you using your dishwasher?
[02:17:02.876 --> 02:17:05.536]  How much air conditioning or heat are you using?
[02:17:06.117 --> 02:17:19.700]  And then, Alex, it sets up the standard where the government can either impose surcharges, oh, you're using too much energy, your carbon footprint is too large, or to say that there's something defective in your home.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:21.780]  Now, why do you live in such a big home?
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:23.980]  How about if we move a poor family in?
[02:17:24.621 --> 02:17:26.601]  Maybe you need to close down part of that home.
[02:17:27.216 --> 02:17:29.057]  We don't think your refrigerator's old enough.
[02:17:29.117 --> 02:17:30.277]  Why don't you buy a new one?
[02:17:30.957 --> 02:17:34.879]  I mean, these are the kinds of intrusions... Well, that's the idea with the cash for clunkers!
[02:17:35.479 --> 02:17:47.244]  Yes, well, the whole aim of government saying, well, we just want to provide you the information to be more efficient is a Trojan horse, because it looks like the government's there to help you.
[02:17:47.824 --> 02:17:53.646]  But once you let the government in the front door, you've let the government measure and monitor your home activity.
[02:17:54.548 --> 02:18:05.432]  And if your home is your castle, this is an invasion, a Fourth Amendment invasion, into what people have as their most sacred part of their life, namely the privacy of their home.
[02:18:05.712 --> 02:18:07.013]  And this is being done by stealth.
[02:18:07.073 --> 02:18:10.094]  I mean, 5 million homes in California are having it put in.
[02:18:10.114 --> 02:18:14.075]  20,000 families are having cameras put in their homes to watch their kids.
[02:18:14.095 --> 02:18:18.577]  They're now saying they may make it standard for all new parents to have cameras watching them in the home.
[02:18:18.917 --> 02:18:19.998]  I mean, this is worse than 1984.
[02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:23.699]  Well, Alex, the fundamental freedom
[02:18:24.356 --> 02:18:39.124]  In terms of not only the government imposition on our lives, monitoring, measuring, controlling, having a bureaucrat make a decision about what you do, whether it's right or wrong, all of that's got to be offensive to any American that cares about fundamental freedom.
[02:18:39.784 --> 02:18:51.811]  For the Fourth Amendment invasion, coming into your home with electronics, where the government can measure and impose taxes on you for energy use, or demand that you use your home in a particular way,
[02:18:52.409 --> 02:18:55.450]  It's completely antithetical to the free enterprise system.
[02:18:55.690 --> 02:18:59.451]  Well, Doc, you reach millions of people on your radio interviews and your column.
[02:19:00.071 --> 02:19:03.392]  Did you know that we did this off a Google Press release three years ago?
[02:19:03.672 --> 02:19:07.893]  That they bragged they're already testing using the camera and the microphone built in.
[02:19:07.913 --> 02:19:11.994]  If you have Google and you're using it to dial in.
[02:19:12.014 --> 02:19:13.915]  I'll have to research that further.
[02:19:13.935 --> 02:19:14.815]  I did not know that.
[02:19:15.155 --> 02:19:15.855]  Dial in with AI.
[02:19:18.942 --> 02:19:20.662]  And they say, don't worry, a human isn't listening.
[02:19:20.722 --> 02:19:22.243]  A computer listens for keywords.
[02:19:22.263 --> 02:19:25.983]  And they say, if a dog barks, then Google ads pop up for a dog.
[02:19:26.283 --> 02:19:30.884]  Headline, government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[02:19:31.644 --> 02:19:40.106]  And they have a link to, in the story from three years ago, we have a link to Google admitting this.
[02:19:40.126 --> 02:19:41.666]  In fact, this is just one of Paul's articles.
[02:19:41.866 --> 02:19:48.167]  Well, this, I think, is one of the key issues of the technology being utilized by the government to control
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:49.760]  We're good to go.
[02:20:18.499 --> 02:20:19.900]  That your home be taken from you.
[02:20:20.701 --> 02:20:42.342]  These are the kinds of concerns that I have when we allow these powerful technologies that Google is developing, this energy meter, to be placed in our homes, ultimately whether we like it or not, as a condition of our receiving electricity that could ultimately be used to tax us or limit our freedoms and how we live our lives within our homes.
[02:20:43.055 --> 02:20:44.216]  Is there any way to stop this?
[02:20:44.236 --> 02:20:46.937]  I mean, obviously educating people, but how do you say no?
[02:20:46.957 --> 02:20:49.298]  I mean, they just came and plopped one on the building here.
[02:20:49.318 --> 02:20:54.620]  Well, I think the first issue is to fight it by letting people know that it's there.
[02:20:54.700 --> 02:21:08.967]  And then I think we've got to start demanding there be some legal action here, because unless they've got a search warrant, what is Google doing invading your business or your home to monitor or measure your energy consumption against your will?
[02:21:09.431 --> 02:21:10.952]  Well, it's like poisoning a well.
[02:21:11.392 --> 02:21:15.935]  They just put it into the technology, like the iPhones, and then we're all just surveilled.
[02:21:16.836 --> 02:21:18.877]  And we've got to be aware of this and start fighting it.
[02:21:18.977 --> 02:21:31.205]  I think the article I wrote in my Red Alert newsletter here, that energy police is really the issue, because the Google Power Meter is regulating your private home by government.
[02:21:31.874 --> 02:21:34.215]  Which ultimately is the beginning of a complete state.
[02:21:34.736 --> 02:21:35.016]  It is.
[02:21:35.536 --> 02:21:37.737]  Dr. Corsi, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:21:38.157 --> 02:21:40.679]  The new book, just out, America for Sale.
[02:21:40.979 --> 02:21:42.660]  It'll be on sale October 13th.
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:44.441]  It's at three stores right now in Amsterdam.
[02:21:44.921 --> 02:21:45.601]  We'll have you on.
[02:21:45.621 --> 02:21:46.062]  God bless.
[02:21:46.082 --> 02:21:46.442]  Take care.
[02:21:51.304 --> 02:21:52.205]  We're on the march.
[02:21:52.685 --> 02:21:54.306]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:55.226 --> 02:21:57.928]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.657 --> 02:22:04.661]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:22:04.901 --> 02:22:06.703]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:22:06.903 --> 02:22:15.191]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:22:15.432 --> 02:22:20.657]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:22:20.997 --> 02:22:22.619]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:22:22.839 --> 02:22:29.161]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:22:29.361 --> 02:22:40.105]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:22:40.406 --> 02:22:40.906]  That's right.
[02:22:41.166 --> 02:22:43.487]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:22:43.727 --> 02:22:45.307]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[02:22:47.268 --> 02:22:47.888]  We're good to go.
[02:23:14.991 --> 02:23:15.511]  We're good to go.
[02:23:39.667 --> 02:23:43.671]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[02:23:43.811 --> 02:23:48.376]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:23:48.696 --> 02:23:51.199]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:23:51.559 --> 02:23:53.241]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:53.621 --> 02:23:55.403]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:23:55.623 --> 02:23:57.425]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:23:57.766 --> 02:23:59.207]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:23:59.567 --> 02:24:00.328]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:01.465 --> 02:24:06.808]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[02:24:07.348 --> 02:24:11.991]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[02:24:12.471 --> 02:24:13.112]  That was then.
[02:24:13.692 --> 02:24:14.332]  This is now.
[02:24:14.993 --> 02:24:17.174]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[02:24:17.694 --> 02:24:23.356]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[02:24:23.756 --> 02:24:32.600]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:35.721]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[02:24:36.441 --> 02:24:40.404]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[02:24:40.904 --> 02:24:41.945]  Video never lies.
[02:24:42.425 --> 02:24:43.586]  Watch Big Brother back.
[02:24:44.086 --> 02:24:45.527]  Visit diginet.net.
[02:24:45.867 --> 02:24:48.408]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:24:48.849 --> 02:24:51.050]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:24:51.450 --> 02:24:52.611]  Diginet dot net.
[02:24:53.131 --> 02:24:53.732]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[02:24:53.752 --> 02:24:54.192]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:08.321]  Into this world we're born.
[02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:09.141]  To this world we're thrown.
[02:25:09.161 --> 02:25:13.563]  If you give the New World Order a ride, folks, it will hurt you bad.
[02:25:13.603 --> 02:25:16.684]  There is a murderer, a killer on the road.
[02:25:35.708 --> 02:25:36.849]  I think the song says it all.
[02:25:36.929 --> 02:25:37.349]  Crank it up.
[02:25:37.849 --> 02:25:39.290]  Let your children play.
[02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:43.772]  Okay, I've cleared the phone lines.
[02:26:00.191 --> 02:26:13.246]  Specifically, if you're a nurse, military person, police officer, medical worker, with inside info on the forced inoculations, we've confirmed with hospital letters, government letters, they're up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPundit.com.
[02:26:13.727 --> 02:26:19.714]  I want to hear your whistleblowing or what's happening at your public school, private school, whatever intel you've got.
[02:26:21.348 --> 02:26:23.889]  Specifically on the flu, those calls only please.
[02:26:24.329 --> 02:26:25.730]  Give folks a chance to get in.
[02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.810]  800-259-9231.
[02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.930]  800-259-9231.
[02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:27.010]  Here's that number.
[02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:28.991]  You're driving along in a squad car.
[02:26:29.011 --> 02:26:29.391]  You're a nurse.
[02:26:29.411 --> 02:26:30.372]  You're a military person.
[02:26:30.652 --> 02:26:31.832]  You've got key info.
[02:26:31.852 --> 02:26:31.892]  1-800-9231.
[02:26:42.483 --> 02:26:42.703]  I think?
[02:27:04.170 --> 02:27:06.453]  Hit the one button on the top, have it in your compartment.
[02:27:06.493 --> 02:27:08.015]  You see military checkpoint.
[02:27:08.035 --> 02:27:09.237]  They're all over the place now.
[02:27:09.678 --> 02:27:11.761]  I've run into these in Austin years ago.
[02:27:11.821 --> 02:27:12.642]  They do them illegally.
[02:27:13.864 --> 02:27:18.089]  We had a Marine Corps retired officer who ran a computer company in Austin, a listener,
[02:27:19.755 --> 02:27:22.517]  He was driving down I-35, had an illegal army checkpoint.
[02:27:22.537 --> 02:27:25.959]  That made him go public to me about secret army raids in the late 80s.
[02:27:26.759 --> 02:27:28.240]  That's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:34.343]  This stuff's intensifying, though, and they're acclimating the police, the military, the citizenry to go along with this.
[02:27:34.824 --> 02:27:38.226]  And it's very, very, very serious.
[02:27:38.266 --> 02:27:39.767]  So that is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:27:39.807 --> 02:27:43.128]  I wanted to tell you about a couple of sponsors that made this ours possible.
[02:27:43.549 --> 02:27:45.290]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:46.871]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[02:27:47.211 --> 02:27:48.632]  Hurricane, snow, ice storms.
[02:27:49.412 --> 02:27:52.393]  Or the government regulating how much power you can have.
[02:27:52.413 --> 02:27:55.214]  Enron shutting off power on purpose to then jack up prices.
[02:27:56.754 --> 02:28:00.715]  All those examples we were just covering, you need to go to mysolarbackup.com.
[02:28:02.075 --> 02:28:07.057]  From our great sponsor Solutions from Science, you get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 800 watt
[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:12.131]  Generator and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:28:12.471 --> 02:28:17.753]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in the blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:28:18.573 --> 02:28:21.133]  Everybody should just move towards getting self-sufficient.
[02:28:21.794 --> 02:28:22.794]  That's what the globalists hate.
[02:28:22.814 --> 02:28:23.654]  They want to control you.
[02:28:23.994 --> 02:28:26.755]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and check out this great starter unit.
[02:28:27.055 --> 02:28:28.155]  Great way to get into solar.
[02:28:28.175 --> 02:28:29.616]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or one word, www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:28:38.641 --> 02:28:41.262]  Also, another great sponsor we have is Silver Lungs.
[02:28:41.302 --> 02:28:49.666]  This is colloidal silver, a great colloidal silver generator in its own right, that then aerosolizes it where you inhale it.
[02:28:50.507 --> 02:28:57.110]  We've had a lot of, well just check out the medical information they have there in the testimonials and reports at silverlungs.com.
[02:28:57.150 --> 02:29:02.512]  That's S-I-L-V-E-R, lungs, silverlungs.com.
[02:29:03.393 --> 02:29:05.074]  Super high quality colloidal silver.
[02:29:05.774 --> 02:29:05.914]  I know.
[02:29:30.279 --> 02:29:37.124]  Want to get into this martial law video and then we're going to talk to Alan, New York nurse at church, told to take vaccine in just a few minutes.
[02:29:38.038 --> 02:29:46.663]  Whistleblowers, people whose children have been threatened, told to take it, any type of forced inoculation or intimidation or having it pushed on you, we want to hear about it.
[02:29:46.683 --> 02:29:55.588]  We confirmed from listeners with all these documents, we called the numbers, states, the feds, medical companies, big conglomerates, ordering people to take it or they're fired.
[02:29:56.208 --> 02:29:57.329]  Absolutely insane.
[02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.970]  So we've confirmed that.
[02:29:59.010 --> 02:30:03.973]  That's important to prove the government's lying and quietly doing this and telling people not to talk about it.
[02:30:03.993 --> 02:30:05.354]  But let's now
[02:30:06.946 --> 02:30:13.369]  Go to this video, violating posse commentatus at National Guard on the streets of Kingman, Arizona.
[02:30:14.209 --> 02:30:21.432]  Kingman, Arizona, Friday, the 18th of September at around 4, 45 p.m.
[02:30:21.472 --> 02:30:28.494]  downtown on Andy Devine National Guard performing police duty, providing security and directing traffic.
[02:30:28.835 --> 02:30:34.257]  And again, the Schenectady, New York, other areas.
[02:30:35.365 --> 02:30:37.646]  The mayor said, oh, we want troops in Alabama.
[02:30:37.686 --> 02:30:39.647]  Birmingham's talking about wanting troops on the streets.
[02:30:39.927 --> 02:30:41.748]  They're just announcing it to you.
[02:30:42.908 --> 02:30:45.269]  What is it the feds have been preparing for decades for?
[02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:46.489]  Why have they been gearing this up?
[02:30:46.549 --> 02:30:47.510]  We told you years ago.
[02:30:47.730 --> 02:30:48.750]  Banking fraud.
[02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:50.791]  Stealing everything through fiat fraud.
[02:30:50.831 --> 02:30:53.012]  The Federal Reserve has carried out the crime.
[02:30:53.352 --> 02:30:55.593]  Now they've got to suppress us for bringing them to justice.
[02:30:56.926 --> 02:31:01.129]  Says we support our soldiers and troops, we cannot support the unlawful deployment of our soldiers on U.S.
[02:31:01.169 --> 02:31:02.510]  soil to police the citizens.
[02:31:02.850 --> 02:31:04.751]  A clear violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.
[02:31:04.771 --> 02:31:06.052]  But yeah, they're not our troops anymore.
[02:31:07.333 --> 02:31:17.119]  And here is the un-American precedent in violating the law in the police state in Kingman, Arizona last week.
[02:31:17.159 --> 02:31:17.579]  Here it is.
[02:31:17.879 --> 02:31:18.360]  Play the video.
[02:31:20.353 --> 02:31:24.216]  Kingman, Arizona, Friday, 18, 2009, around 4.45 p.m.
[02:31:24.557 --> 02:31:26.858]  National Guard performing police duty.
[02:31:27.959 --> 02:31:29.761]  And again, they restate, they support the troops.
[02:31:29.801 --> 02:31:30.802]  Why do we have to always say that?
[02:31:30.842 --> 02:31:34.765]  Like we're bad, like we're an enemy army.
[02:31:34.925 --> 02:31:35.686]  Here they are driving.
[02:31:35.706 --> 02:31:37.407]  I think we have National Guard.
[02:31:38.048 --> 02:31:39.189]  I'm gonna ask them.
[02:31:47.017 --> 02:31:48.678]  Yes, I need to.
[02:31:48.938 --> 02:31:49.398]  I need to.
[02:31:49.418 --> 02:31:50.079]  Okay, let's go.
[02:31:50.479 --> 02:31:52.380]  This is off a video pin.
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:53.661]  So should they come back?
[02:31:53.781 --> 02:31:54.121]  No.
[02:31:54.722 --> 02:31:57.523]  So they just saw troops.
[02:31:57.543 --> 02:31:59.324]  They've got their little camera.
[02:31:59.624 --> 02:32:00.765]  I want to know.
[02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:02.466]  And why are they here?
[02:32:02.506 --> 02:32:04.907]  This is for traffic, but why are they here?
[02:32:04.947 --> 02:32:06.208]  I'm curious.
[02:32:06.288 --> 02:32:07.489]  It's our right to know.
[02:32:07.529 --> 02:32:09.050]  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
[02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:13.012]  I'm going to ask you better English.
[02:32:16.923 --> 02:32:17.344]  Hi there.
[02:32:17.804 --> 02:32:21.268]  Just real curious, why is the National Guard out here?
[02:32:21.489 --> 02:32:24.593]  Uh, we're just helping with security and traffic and stuff for the races.
[02:32:24.873 --> 02:32:25.674]  Are you under the city?
[02:32:25.754 --> 02:32:27.056]  Are you working for the city right now?
[02:32:27.336 --> 02:32:28.597]  Are you working for the city?
[02:32:29.258 --> 02:32:31.461]  Are you under the control of the police though?
[02:32:31.701 --> 02:32:33.083]  I have no idea actually.
[02:32:33.203 --> 02:32:34.244]  I just do what I'm told.
[02:32:34.264 --> 02:32:35.206]  I just do what I'm told.
[02:32:35.506 --> 02:32:36.607]  I don't know, but we'll call you that.
[02:32:36.627 --> 02:32:37.187]  You're a surgeon?
[02:32:37.567 --> 02:32:38.368]  Okay, that's cool.
[02:32:38.408 --> 02:32:38.748]  Thank you.
[02:32:38.888 --> 02:32:40.830]  Have you ever done anything like this before?
[02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:41.350]  A fare?
[02:32:41.390 --> 02:32:42.271]  A National Guard?
[02:32:42.531 --> 02:32:42.691]  Nope.
[02:32:42.931 --> 02:32:43.952]  Five dollar change in my pocket.
[02:32:43.972 --> 02:32:45.033]  This is the way it is, you know?
[02:32:45.093 --> 02:32:48.475]  This is not for civilian... I mean, you're operating in a civilian environment.
[02:32:48.595 --> 02:32:49.896]  There's supposed to be a public address there.
[02:32:50.417 --> 02:32:53.559]  The Army or the National Guard shouldn't be here unless there's an emergency.
[02:32:54.139 --> 02:32:54.420]  You know?
[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:55.160]  Anyway, thank you.
[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:56.001]  I won't get for that.
[02:32:56.061 --> 02:32:56.921]  Not a good thing.
[02:32:57.021 --> 02:33:03.146]  And not against you, but it's not a good thing what's happening in this country when the military is teaming up with local police.
[02:33:03.246 --> 02:33:04.567]  We're not liking this at all.
[02:33:05.945 --> 02:33:06.425]  Nothing with you.
[02:33:06.465 --> 02:33:07.105]  Nothing with you.
[02:33:07.125 --> 02:33:07.406]  Thank you.
[02:33:07.426 --> 02:33:10.727]  We're not back to business at all.
[02:33:13.568 --> 02:33:15.408]  Back at the scene of the crime an hour later.
[02:33:15.788 --> 02:33:16.429]  More troops.
[02:33:16.809 --> 02:33:17.029]  Huh?
[02:33:17.729 --> 02:33:18.469]  I think not.
[02:33:21.010 --> 02:33:22.031]  I don't think so.
[02:33:22.411 --> 02:33:25.072]  I don't think so either.
[02:33:26.172 --> 02:33:27.112]  This is so criminal.
[02:33:28.413 --> 02:33:29.753]  It's all a part of acclimation.
[02:33:31.474 --> 02:33:32.654]  They've set up a checkpoint.
[02:33:33.615 --> 02:33:34.555]  They've got roadblocks.
[02:33:36.084 --> 02:33:38.105]  Acclimating everyone for the total takeover.
[02:33:38.125 --> 02:33:41.127]  They'll just do it year after year until you totally accept it.
[02:33:41.147 --> 02:33:42.387]  They're going to be coming in your homes.
[02:33:42.907 --> 02:33:46.689]  Fifteen million dollar fines for selling any recalled toys or products at a garage sale.
[02:33:47.250 --> 02:33:48.510]  Here come the troops over to them.
[02:33:48.570 --> 02:33:49.391]  Let me see.
[02:33:49.451 --> 02:33:50.071]  Hello there.
[02:33:50.131 --> 02:33:59.416]  National Guard just came here.
[02:33:59.436 --> 02:34:00.056]  Yeah, they just left.
[02:34:00.396 --> 02:34:01.277]  They just left.
[02:34:01.437 --> 02:34:02.277]  What are they doing here?
[02:34:05.779 --> 02:34:06.760]  There's security service.
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:07.540]  All right, that's enough.
[02:34:08.661 --> 02:34:09.101]  That's enough.
[02:34:09.141 --> 02:34:12.343]  You can watch the rest at InfoWars.com from the Mojave Minute Man.
[02:34:12.383 --> 02:34:13.644]  I want to get the Mojave Minute Man on.
[02:34:13.944 --> 02:34:16.285]  We have Tom in Arizona saying he's a witness at National Guard.
[02:34:16.305 --> 02:34:18.007]  And we're going to Alex in Florida.
[02:34:18.047 --> 02:34:19.648]  Children in school told to take shots.
[02:34:20.128 --> 02:34:23.190]  Allen in New York, nurse told to take vaccine.
[02:34:23.810 --> 02:34:24.711]  This is unbelievable.
[02:34:24.811 --> 02:34:28.833]  But Tom in Arizona, did you see this in Kingman, Arizona?
[02:34:28.853 --> 02:34:29.474]  Or where were you?
[02:34:29.954 --> 02:34:33.276]  Yes, I live in Kingman, Arizona, and they were there on Friday.
[02:34:34.418 --> 02:34:36.739]  And they were eyeballing me as I drove by.
[02:34:36.759 --> 02:34:39.500]  It was very uncomfortable.
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:41.181]  I did not see weapons.
[02:34:42.061 --> 02:34:47.444]  Have you seen Endgame, where I have troops come over with guns and they say, you turn your bleeping camera off?
[02:34:48.044 --> 02:34:48.624]  Absolutely.
[02:34:49.384 --> 02:34:49.604]  Yes.
[02:34:49.985 --> 02:34:52.626]  And I know the man that was videotaping that.
[02:34:53.406 --> 02:35:02.530]  And we had a protest a few weeks ago in Kingman, and none of the press showed up, even though they were all notified, for Oath Keepers.
[02:35:03.089 --> 02:35:05.151]  That's what that man is involved in.
[02:35:06.452 --> 02:35:11.836]  Also, I have to tell you that at UNLV in Las Vegas, forced inoculations.
[02:35:11.896 --> 02:35:13.837]  My daughter got inoculated.
[02:35:13.857 --> 02:35:18.561]  They forced her to go, if she wanted to go to the school, you gotta be inoculated.
[02:35:19.161 --> 02:35:27.568]  Now the Kingman police are out of their jurisdiction, all the way up by the dam, 40 miles north of the town, and they got the National Guard in Kingman.
[02:35:29.574 --> 02:35:31.495]  I also would like to tell you, are you still there?
[02:35:31.515 --> 02:35:32.556]  Listen, let me just stop you.
[02:35:32.696 --> 02:35:34.517]  I can't even pay attention to all that's happening.
[02:35:34.857 --> 02:35:39.821]  I just noticed we have a We Are Change Ohio with MPs coming up and talking to people.
[02:35:39.841 --> 02:35:43.903]  I mean, the military is totally taking over.
[02:35:43.943 --> 02:35:47.025]  This is Red Dawn, but they just do it and then nothing happens.
[02:35:47.085 --> 02:35:52.049]  And you're saying at the university they ordered your daughter and made her?
[02:35:52.449 --> 02:35:53.169]  She didn't run?
[02:35:53.189 --> 02:35:54.730]  Yes, yes.
[02:35:55.271 --> 02:35:57.172]  I don't know what inoculations she had to take.
[02:35:57.506 --> 02:36:01.609]  But she said they had her take a whole bunch of inoculations, even a tetanus shot.
[02:36:02.069 --> 02:36:03.050]  See, it's all beginning.
[02:36:03.350 --> 02:36:03.870]  Oh my God.
[02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:04.971]  Listen to this, Alex.
[02:36:05.011 --> 02:36:06.292]  This is very important.
[02:36:06.952 --> 02:36:14.277]  In the early 90s, my kids were sexually molested in Chicago, and she got hooked up with the political machine there.
[02:36:14.577 --> 02:36:15.477]  They covered it up.
[02:36:16.418 --> 02:36:18.559]  The psychiatrist's name, can I mention it?
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:20.861]  No, I don't want to get into stuff I can't document.
[02:36:22.489 --> 02:36:30.122]  Besides that, their solution was to cover it up and put all my kids on dexedrine saying they had ADHD for years.
[02:36:31.149 --> 02:36:33.111]  And you can imagine what effect that has on him.
[02:36:33.311 --> 02:36:35.613]  Well, sir, listen, I gotta get to the other calls on flu.
[02:36:35.653 --> 02:36:37.215]  Call me back when we're not in such a rush.
[02:36:37.755 --> 02:36:39.997]  Thank you for the great folks that are getting the video.
[02:36:40.277 --> 02:36:41.479]  We commend you and salute you.
[02:36:41.499 --> 02:36:42.580]  I don't doubt anything you're saying.
[02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:48.465]  I just have to be careful because you could be an operative calling in from... I don't think you are, but I just have to watch people of something unsubstantiated.
[02:36:48.825 --> 02:36:55.551]  Even when I used to show the Marines trying to confiscate our guns in my film, Martial Law, in the film Police State 2000, people thought it was fake.
[02:36:56.292 --> 02:36:58.514]  I mean, they just can't understand how real this is.
[02:36:58.614 --> 02:37:02.217]  They're just acclimating, acclimating, but it's all building through a crescendo.
[02:37:02.818 --> 02:37:05.039]  Guys, pull up that We Are Change Ohio video.
[02:37:06.981 --> 02:37:07.501]  Play that.
[02:37:07.521 --> 02:37:09.743]  I know it's got some music at the first.
[02:37:09.803 --> 02:37:11.084]  This is troops in Ohio.
[02:37:11.104 --> 02:37:11.965]  They're just everywhere.
[02:37:12.025 --> 02:37:12.506]  Here it is.
[02:37:13.326 --> 02:37:14.687]  First is the Kentucky Derby.
[02:37:16.149 --> 02:37:17.670]  Then it's New York.
[02:37:17.770 --> 02:37:19.251]  Then it's the NFL games.
[02:37:19.291 --> 02:37:20.753]  Then it's high school, college games.
[02:37:20.773 --> 02:37:21.613]  We have troops doing it.
[02:37:22.654 --> 02:37:23.495]  Now it's Ohio.
[02:37:27.244 --> 02:37:29.746]  This is Newport, Kentucky.
[02:37:30.346 --> 02:37:33.368]  Military checkpoints that appeared around downtown September 6th.
[02:37:34.089 --> 02:37:37.571]  Officially, this was done for traffic control.
[02:37:38.131 --> 02:37:40.153]  See, for the local Riverfest celebration.
[02:37:40.473 --> 02:37:41.414]  They use any excuse.
[02:37:41.434 --> 02:37:42.655]  Oh, the Army's just here.
[02:37:43.175 --> 02:37:44.076]  Oh, it's just normal.
[02:37:44.516 --> 02:37:45.557]  Get everybody used to it.
[02:37:45.637 --> 02:37:46.938]  I can't believe this.
[02:37:47.698 --> 02:37:48.579]  Look, there are the troops.
[02:37:49.949 --> 02:37:51.349]  Videos up on InfoWars.com.
[02:37:51.369 --> 02:37:54.010]  We've got to get We Are Change Ohio on about this as soon as possible.
[02:37:54.030 --> 02:37:55.590]  I want to get Mojave Minute Men on.
[02:37:55.650 --> 02:37:57.611]  This is just, I mean, they know the people are waking up.
[02:37:57.651 --> 02:37:59.091]  They know they're going to destroy the dollar.
[02:37:59.552 --> 02:38:01.972]  The people are going to get angry, and they've got the troops standing by.
[02:38:02.532 --> 02:38:04.833]  Every time there's a shooting, they call out regular Marines now.
[02:38:05.813 --> 02:38:06.413]  Look at this!
[02:38:08.214 --> 02:38:08.854]  Look at this!
[02:38:09.214 --> 02:38:10.494]  This is total red dawn!
[02:38:10.674 --> 02:38:12.615]  Absolutely kryptonite to America!
[02:38:16.104 --> 02:38:17.625]  Look at him, he's got a sidearm on!
[02:38:17.945 --> 02:38:19.206]  A Beretta or a .45?
[02:38:19.367 --> 02:38:23.370]  Beretta 9mm or... My gosh, heaven help us.
[02:38:23.530 --> 02:38:24.591]  Oh, look at all those Humvees.
[02:38:24.611 --> 02:38:25.571]  Look at all those troops.
[02:38:25.752 --> 02:38:26.292]  Armed troops.
[02:38:27.153 --> 02:38:30.235]  Oh yeah, it's just helping with security at the River Fest.
[02:38:31.336 --> 02:38:32.257]  Just any event.
[02:38:33.251 --> 02:38:37.595]  Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, California, Arizona, Florida.
[02:38:38.036 --> 02:38:44.682]  Florida's had a drill two months ago with, uh, was it 12 or 13 nations from Latin America landing, quote, for anti-terror drills.
[02:38:45.042 --> 02:38:48.125]  NLE09 admits they're going to use foreign troops in America.
[02:38:48.806 --> 02:38:50.647]  Firing corporate takeover of the United States.
[02:38:50.747 --> 02:38:52.109]  Absolute, total, hot treason.
[02:38:53.345 --> 02:38:55.446]  Folks, they're doing this so they can rob you blind.
[02:38:55.486 --> 02:38:59.049]  I want you to know, and they're acclimating the troops to direct the public.
[02:38:59.629 --> 02:39:01.511]  Look at this guy, fresh back from Iraq.
[02:39:02.151 --> 02:39:03.112]  He's now out there.
[02:39:04.453 --> 02:39:07.054]  They're getting everybody ready for checkpoints, everybody ready for control.
[02:39:07.375 --> 02:39:08.255]  This is so criminal.
[02:39:08.295 --> 02:39:09.016]  This is so evil.
[02:39:09.036 --> 02:39:11.758]  They're trying them for gun confiscation drills in Arcadia.
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:13.000]  Iowa.
[02:39:13.721 --> 02:39:14.801]  Just all over the town.
[02:39:14.881 --> 02:39:15.242]  Troops.
[02:39:16.182 --> 02:39:18.824]  Oh my God, the troops are questioning people right there on the video.
[02:39:19.464 --> 02:39:21.145]  Troops coming up, directing people.
[02:39:21.686 --> 02:39:24.047]  Everybody getting used to troops eyeballing everyone.
[02:39:24.347 --> 02:39:28.970]  We have the internal FBI training videos for police and military where they train them to watch citizens.
[02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:30.491]  Absolutely hellish.
[02:39:30.531 --> 02:39:31.952]  Total criminality unfolding.
[02:39:36.479 --> 02:39:40.800]  We got Alex in Texas calling in with Fox News, Massachusetts Governor Marshall Law Report.
[02:39:41.201 --> 02:39:43.441]  Children in school being told to take forcible shots.
[02:39:45.102 --> 02:39:48.803]  I just can't even... Why does this have to happen to us?
[02:39:48.843 --> 02:39:49.983]  Do you know what this means?
[02:39:50.003 --> 02:39:53.985]  And they're just going to keep doing it like it's no big deal until they finally drop the hammer.
[02:39:54.305 --> 02:39:55.645]  Here they are talking to the troops.
[02:39:56.105 --> 02:39:56.625]  Turn it up!
[02:39:58.806 --> 02:39:59.706]  Unbelievable!
[02:40:01.887 --> 02:40:04.168]  Look at the troops coming over, trained to look for terrorists.
[02:40:05.441 --> 02:40:08.124]  I've seen two marines earlier, but I think it's just us that's running this.
[02:40:08.805 --> 02:40:09.766]  Cool.
[02:40:10.407 --> 02:40:13.150]  So what exactly are you guys here for?
[02:40:13.170 --> 02:40:18.137]  Like, what's the main reason that we're here?
[02:40:18.157 --> 02:40:19.638]  Traffic control.
[02:40:19.678 --> 02:40:19.999]  Hit pause.
[02:40:23.499 --> 02:40:25.841]  Lotus, notice local events all over the country.
[02:40:25.861 --> 02:40:27.322]  This is what they were doing years ago.
[02:40:27.362 --> 02:40:28.283]  It's in martial law.
[02:40:28.684 --> 02:40:31.866]  Searching three-year-old kids walking down the street on video.
[02:40:32.287 --> 02:40:32.727]  Photos.
[02:40:32.787 --> 02:40:34.729]  We have, I mean, it's so evil!
[02:40:35.249 --> 02:40:39.233]  Remember the guys that ran on the field after the Kentucky Derby and I'm sitting there eating in a restaurant watching it?
[02:40:39.773 --> 02:40:42.856]  And troops jump out with guns and run on the field for fans?
[02:40:43.517 --> 02:40:45.098]  See, they don't use police now.
[02:40:45.158 --> 02:40:46.159]  It's about training you.
[02:40:46.419 --> 02:40:47.220]  Go back to the video.
[02:40:50.939 --> 02:40:51.939]  That way to this way.
[02:40:52.039 --> 02:40:53.100]  Hold ice water.
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:53.580]  It's free.
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:56.441]  Don't concentrate.
[02:40:57.682 --> 02:40:59.162]  We're the Army National Guard.
[02:40:59.202 --> 02:41:01.803]  We cover stuff inside the National Guard.
[02:41:03.224 --> 02:41:03.984]  Homeland Brigade.
[02:41:04.024 --> 02:41:05.485]  Take a look.
[02:41:05.505 --> 02:41:07.005]  That was in emergencies.
[02:41:07.085 --> 02:41:08.246]  Do you know where to stop?
[02:41:08.406 --> 02:41:09.746]  Just be in emergencies.
[02:41:09.806 --> 02:41:10.626]  It's for anything.
[02:41:11.627 --> 02:41:16.469]  Public events where local police departments don't have the manpower to cover.
[02:41:16.529 --> 02:41:16.969]  Hit pause.
[02:41:18.396 --> 02:41:19.496]  Total federalization.
[02:41:19.536 --> 02:41:21.417]  We'll cover more of this tomorrow.
[02:41:22.657 --> 02:41:24.277]  They're definitely dropping the hammer right now.
[02:41:24.297 --> 02:41:26.718]  And I love this country and my family that lives here so much.
[02:41:27.538 --> 02:41:28.338]  This is so bad.
[02:41:28.378 --> 02:41:29.459]  This is Nazi Germany.
[02:41:29.499 --> 02:41:30.599]  This is Soviet Russia.
[02:41:30.879 --> 02:41:32.459]  This is going to be so bad, folks.
[02:41:32.519 --> 02:41:33.439]  It's so bad.
[02:41:33.459 --> 02:41:38.261]  And when those dumb young kids try to go out and get our guns, it's going to be hell.
[02:41:38.341 --> 02:41:39.881]  And that's what the globalists are planning on.
[02:41:39.921 --> 02:41:41.841]  We've got to get the government to back off.
[02:41:42.101 --> 02:41:43.942]  They've got to stop their criminal activity.
[02:41:45.268 --> 02:41:48.310]  Alex in Texas, and we're going to the parents and people with the four shots.
[02:41:48.731 --> 02:41:50.612]  What is Fox News reporting in Massachusetts?
[02:41:51.433 --> 02:41:52.273]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:41:52.333 --> 02:41:55.076]  Thank you for all the information and the education.
[02:41:55.156 --> 02:42:11.248]  But just this morning on Fox News, around 6 o'clock in the morning, they're saying that the governor of Massachusetts has signed an executive order for non-medical personnel to be able to go into people's homes
[02:42:11.869 --> 02:42:13.390]  Inject them with the vaccine.
[02:42:13.430 --> 02:42:14.071]  Oh, I saw that!
[02:42:14.111 --> 02:42:15.292]  And even take their children.
[02:42:15.753 --> 02:42:16.593]  Yes, I saw that.
[02:42:16.813 --> 02:42:25.941]  Massachusetts, non-medical workers, inoculation, Boston Globe last week, but they couldn't pass the law, I guess, because they were trying... He just did an executive order.
[02:42:27.163 --> 02:42:35.810]  Yes, and I said that it's going to go to the Senate for approval, so... And then notice they're busy denying all this is happening as it's happening.
[02:42:37.191 --> 02:42:37.772]  Absolutely.
[02:42:38.972 --> 02:42:40.354]  What do you think about all this?
[02:42:40.715 --> 02:42:41.756]  Troops everywhere!
[02:42:41.776 --> 02:42:45.361]  It's awful, Alex.
[02:42:45.681 --> 02:42:47.123]  I mean, it's hard to believe.
[02:42:47.203 --> 02:42:56.215]  I'm surprised people aren't, you know, well, you're helping people wake up to this, but I know there's a lot of people out there in denial.
[02:42:56.235 --> 02:42:57.076]  They can't believe that.
[02:42:57.572 --> 02:43:00.435]  Our country can do this to the people.
[02:43:00.715 --> 02:43:02.056]  Oh, look, they're going for Brooke.
[02:43:02.076 --> 02:43:02.817]  I just skipped a break.
[02:43:02.837 --> 02:43:03.578]  This is too important.
[02:43:04.038 --> 02:43:05.960]  Look, folks, this is eugenics.
[02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:06.780]  This is pure evil.
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:10.063]  They're brainwashing these dumb young kids in these uniforms.
[02:43:10.484 --> 02:43:12.245]  They're bringing them back from Iraq against us.
[02:43:12.325 --> 02:43:13.166]  This is hell.
[02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.650]  Anything else?
[02:43:18.631 --> 02:43:19.992]  No, no, Alex.
[02:43:20.012 --> 02:43:21.714]  I hadn't heard you mention that, so I just wanted...
[02:43:22.443 --> 02:43:27.520]  Well, we've got to launch some, thank you, God bless, yeah, that's, yes, you're right, I remember the story.
[02:43:28.424 --> 02:43:30.386]  Yeah, they said they're going to come in your house, take your kids.
[02:43:30.426 --> 02:43:34.929]  They're training the clergy, tens of thousands, to tell their flocks, go to FEMA camps, turn their guns in.
[02:43:35.310 --> 02:43:38.773]  They're sending out questionnaires to business owners saying, will you submit to martial law?
[02:43:39.053 --> 02:43:41.495]  Mainstream government document, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:41.915 --> 02:43:43.657]  They are going to use the flu as their cover.
[02:43:43.677 --> 02:43:47.220]  Now, if we get the word out on this, they'll back off, but then keep acclimating.
[02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:49.982]  And then go, we'll launch and have all the local good old boys.
[02:43:50.322 --> 02:43:53.245]  I'm out here with the troops and the Marines and the National Guard.
[02:43:53.505 --> 02:43:55.467]  What's wrong with them searching for stuff?
[02:43:55.727 --> 02:43:56.868]  We're patriots!
[02:43:57.208 --> 02:44:04.477]  You know, this fake conservatism, this fake liberalism, I'm just... Everybody needs to call the White House, Congress.
[02:44:04.497 --> 02:44:06.579]  We need to get our congressmen speaking out against this.
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:12.266]  The Governor's Association did write letters to Obama saying we don't want martial law, we don't want North Com on the streets.
[02:44:13.387 --> 02:44:14.549]  My head is spinning right now.
[02:44:16.857 --> 02:44:17.457]  God help us.
[02:44:18.078 --> 02:44:21.320]  And I'm sending my guys to do just like those guys just did.
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:23.001]  To go up and talk to the troops.
[02:44:23.682 --> 02:44:25.443]  In fact, call Do right now before I forget.
[02:44:25.483 --> 02:44:26.024]  Leave a video.
[02:44:26.064 --> 02:44:29.966]  I want them to go up and talk to the troops like we are Change Ohio and everybody else are doing.
[02:44:29.986 --> 02:44:32.969]  They're already on an airplane, but I want that on Do's phone so he knows.
[02:44:34.229 --> 02:44:34.930]  Oh my God.
[02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:40.354]  I just... Because it's just happening everywhere now.
[02:44:40.394 --> 02:44:41.515]  Like I told you it would.
[02:44:41.835 --> 02:44:42.756]  This is the build-up.
[02:44:42.916 --> 02:44:43.556]  Red Alert!
[02:44:44.917 --> 02:44:45.417]  Let's go to...
[02:44:47.862 --> 02:44:50.463]  Alex in Florida, children in school told to take shots.
[02:44:50.563 --> 02:44:50.824]  Alex?
[02:44:52.364 --> 02:44:53.765]  Hello?
[02:44:54.205 --> 02:44:54.545]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:56.787 --> 02:44:57.007]  Hello?
[02:44:57.407 --> 02:44:58.467]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:44:59.088 --> 02:45:00.048]  Yeah, now I can hear you.
[02:45:00.468 --> 02:45:04.891]  Yeah, I just... Good to speak to you and thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:45:06.692 --> 02:45:14.996]  Basically, when my wife went to go ahead and sign my two children and my daughter, which is in high school, and my son, which is in elementary school, they gave her a piece of paper
[02:45:15.686 --> 02:45:24.052]  And basically the questions are asking or telling requirements in regards to the fluoride pill, the H1N1 vaccine.
[02:45:24.232 --> 02:45:25.873]  The fluoride pills!
[02:45:25.893 --> 02:45:29.135]  I remember them giving me that at Margaret Singer Elementary I went to in Dallas.
[02:45:29.175 --> 02:45:31.676]  They're now saying you gotta take the fluoride pills too!
[02:45:32.337 --> 02:45:34.038]  Yeah, and that's the first time I've ever heard of it.
[02:45:34.118 --> 02:45:41.643]  So, I was actually in shock, but thankfully because I have listened to you and have looked up the information on the internet, I told her prior to this
[02:45:42.125 --> 02:45:49.292]  And because it gave her the ability to say no, she said no and she signed off on a piece of paper.
[02:45:49.332 --> 02:45:59.282]  She does have a copy of the sheet, but it does require... I'm begging you to scan it and send it to ridersandinfowars.com with a short email blurb.
[02:45:59.642 --> 02:46:01.424]  You must take the fluoride pills.
[02:46:01.464 --> 02:46:03.226]  I mean, it's body snatcher level.
[02:46:03.546 --> 02:46:05.187]  It's Twilight Zone.
[02:46:05.468 --> 02:46:06.269]  It's hellish.
[02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:09.472]  But Glenn Beck's not going to tell his people about it.
[02:46:09.692 --> 02:46:11.293]  The liberals aren't going to tell their people.
[02:46:11.533 --> 02:46:13.315]  We're just going into tyranny.
[02:46:15.596 --> 02:46:16.337]  That's correct, sir.
[02:46:17.518 --> 02:46:18.459]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:46:19.039 --> 02:46:19.379]  Go ahead.
[02:46:19.399 --> 02:46:25.684]  I think that they still sell 4-I toothpaste as well, and they're still pushing that stuff in the dentist's office.
[02:46:25.704 --> 02:46:26.845]  So, I still call them that.
[02:46:26.865 --> 02:46:28.406]  They're brain-damaging people by design.
[02:46:28.967 --> 02:46:30.348]  Most of the public is completely brain-damaged.
[02:46:30.368 --> 02:46:31.549]  That's why you can't even talk to them.
[02:46:31.589 --> 02:46:32.429]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:32.509 --> 02:46:33.190]  God help us.
[02:46:34.938 --> 02:46:39.843]  I'm telling you, in my gut and intellectually, and I'm seeing all the signs, they are moving at light speed.
[02:46:39.964 --> 02:46:43.267]  Everybody, you better do banner hangs over overpasses.
[02:46:43.287 --> 02:46:44.809]  You better put up micro-FMs.
[02:46:45.149 --> 02:46:46.411]  You better put up your own websites.
[02:46:46.431 --> 02:46:47.692]  You better call into talk radio.
[02:46:47.712 --> 02:46:48.893]  You better go to city council.
[02:46:49.174 --> 02:46:51.676]  You better run around with bullhorns in the streets.
[02:46:51.776 --> 02:46:56.702]  It's time for everybody to go completely wild, speaking out about the New World Order, about the troops.
[02:46:57.242 --> 02:46:58.504]  It's time to go up to the troops.
[02:46:58.584 --> 02:46:59.666]  It's time to talk to them.
[02:46:59.966 --> 02:47:03.131]  It's time to let them know that you're aware of what they're doing.
[02:47:03.211 --> 02:47:06.015]  It's time to explain to them how they're being acclimated.
[02:47:06.756 --> 02:47:08.218]  God, these are just kids out there.
[02:47:08.238 --> 02:47:10.462]  They're brainwashing these poor stupid young punks.
[02:47:12.854 --> 02:47:14.735]  Oh God, and I've seen the internal drilling.
[02:47:15.755 --> 02:47:21.418]  I got it in martial law where the Marines put a militia man down on his knees and they simulate shooting you in the back of the head.
[02:47:21.438 --> 02:47:25.680]  And I want to tell the stupid Marines and Army people something and they aren't awake.
[02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:32.763]  They will use you up in a minute and they plan for you to get chewed up for the I-4 troops to come in after the Patriots defeat you.
[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:34.720]  You're being played.
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:35.941]  God help you.
[02:47:36.861 --> 02:47:37.561]  God help you.
[02:47:37.661 --> 02:47:38.501]  God help us.
[02:47:39.562 --> 02:47:41.442]  It's got to really hit home how real this is.
[02:47:41.502 --> 02:47:44.043]  It's got to really hit home what's happening to us.
[02:47:47.004 --> 02:47:50.745]  Allen, New York nurse, church told to take vaccine.
[02:47:51.125 --> 02:47:55.086]  What did your clergy response team, FEMA preacher tell you to take it or you go to hell?
[02:47:56.986 --> 02:47:58.007]  Alex, God bless you.
[02:47:59.127 --> 02:48:03.148]  There is a lady in our church who is a full time nurse at a local hospital.
[02:48:04.262 --> 02:48:08.606]  And her story actually made the front page of the Schenectady Gazette.
[02:48:09.306 --> 02:48:11.348]  Oh, were your mayors calling for martial law?
[02:48:12.328 --> 02:48:13.409]  See, it's everywhere!
[02:48:13.529 --> 02:48:14.270]  It's everywhere!
[02:48:14.290 --> 02:48:17.132]  I remember that.
[02:48:18.273 --> 02:48:24.758]  She's been told, according to the September 19th copy of the Gazette, mandatory flu shots not welcome.
[02:48:24.838 --> 02:48:28.281]  Healthcare workers can be fired if they refuse.
[02:48:29.290 --> 02:48:33.974]  If you'll furnish me with an address, I'll send you a copy of the papers so that you have this documented.
[02:48:34.034 --> 02:48:37.837]  Well, we can probably pull it up in this, uh, what's the headline in the Schenectady News again?
[02:48:38.317 --> 02:48:40.839]  It's the Schenectady Gazette, September 19th.
[02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:42.380]  And what was the headline?
[02:48:43.401 --> 02:48:44.842]  Uh, it's on the very front page.
[02:48:44.882 --> 02:48:47.504]  It says, mandatory flu shots not welcome.
[02:48:48.225 --> 02:48:50.006]  Mandatory flu shots not welcome.
[02:48:50.446 --> 02:48:51.267]  Schenectady Gazette.
[02:48:51.287 --> 02:48:52.768]  Mandatory flu shots not welcome.
[02:48:52.868 --> 02:48:56.311]  Healthcare workers can be fired if they refuse.
[02:48:56.411 --> 02:48:57.732]  If this lady does not
[02:48:58.961 --> 02:49:00.682]  Except the flu shot by November 1st.
[02:49:00.722 --> 02:49:01.423]  So there it is.
[02:49:01.483 --> 02:49:06.726]  We've got Obama lying and denying it and caller after caller after caller with it in the local news.
[02:49:06.766 --> 02:49:08.167]  We have the internal documents.
[02:49:08.447 --> 02:49:10.008]  Troops popping up everywhere.
[02:49:10.788 --> 02:49:11.409]  God help us.
[02:49:12.729 --> 02:49:13.290]  Absolutely.
[02:49:13.530 --> 02:49:16.432]  Do you understand how they do this martial law in slow motion?
[02:49:18.933 --> 02:49:19.153]  Yes.
[02:49:19.193 --> 02:49:19.393]  Sorry.
[02:49:20.014 --> 02:49:20.314]  Go ahead.
[02:49:21.675 --> 02:49:22.555]  Alex, God bless you.
[02:49:22.575 --> 02:49:23.796]  You're doing an excellent job.
[02:49:24.619 --> 02:49:27.743]  Well, listen, everybody's got to do banner hangs.
[02:49:28.003 --> 02:49:28.644]  There's the article.
[02:49:29.284 --> 02:49:30.205]  A Daily Gazette.
[02:49:30.746 --> 02:49:32.047]  Mandatory flu shot's not welcome.
[02:49:32.087 --> 02:49:33.950]  Healthcare workers can be fired if they refuse.
[02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:34.931]  Totally criminal.
[02:49:34.991 --> 02:49:35.551]  No law.
[02:49:35.792 --> 02:49:36.653]  But they just say it.
[02:49:37.554 --> 02:49:38.835]  What are we going to do, folks?
[02:49:40.949 --> 02:49:41.830]  Everybody, don't wait.
[02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:43.831]  Do banner hangs against martial law.
[02:49:44.211 --> 02:49:46.252]  Banner hangs saying martial law taking over.
[02:49:46.532 --> 02:49:47.953]  Call into all talk radio.
[02:49:48.033 --> 02:49:52.416]  I need a battle plan from Paul Watson explaining that we got to get the info war out now.
[02:49:52.856 --> 02:49:55.037]  They are just incrementally moving against us.
[02:49:55.077 --> 02:49:56.318]  They know that's hard to beat.
[02:49:56.758 --> 02:49:57.819]  Brainwashing the troops.
[02:49:57.879 --> 02:49:58.979]  Brainwashing the police.
[02:49:59.019 --> 02:50:00.120]  Brainwashing the public.
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.881]  Total acclimation happening.
[02:50:01.941 --> 02:50:03.102]  Foreign banks robbing us.
[02:50:04.537 --> 02:50:07.200]  This radio show, we're on the front lines of the Info War.
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:10.503]  We are your wartime broadcasters battling to save the Republic.
[02:50:10.784 --> 02:50:13.787]  The Republic has essentially been seized by foreign offshore corporations.
[02:50:14.327 --> 02:50:15.669]  The Republic has fallen.
[02:50:15.969 --> 02:50:17.090]  We must resuscitate it.
