[00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:04.332]  Big Brother.
[00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:06.033]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:07.854]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.514 --> 00:00:09.334]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:11.015]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:15.337]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:19.899]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:28.662]  Well, an extremely important broadcast lined up today on this Thursday, the 17th day of December 2009.
[00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:38.728]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, simulcasting the entire four hours of radio at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.689]  We are live right now.
[00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.993]  Okay, we do have the episode posted up on YouTube, for as long as it's there, linked on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.275]  Of the three shows, I think it's the best.
[00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:56.730]  I thought the 9-11 piece was the best until I had a chance to see this in its entirety.
[00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.874]  I'd seen pieces of it as a consultant, as you can see in the credits for the TruTV television show.
[00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:09.839]  It's the highest rated new show they've ever had, and it held its ratings, which they never do.
[00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:10.339]  Very, very rare.
[00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:15.442]  Usually a premiere has the highest ratings, or a season finale.
[00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:20.023]  But it's holding at record ratings for TruTV.
[00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.784]  And very, very exciting.
[00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:24.644]  Jesse Ventura, I can only salute him.
[00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:26.425]  This has never before been done.
[00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:36.327]  This is an anti-New World Order show that exposes Maury Strong, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, their plan to rob everybody, their plan to set up a dictatorship.
[00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:46.962]  They aired last week a 9-11 piece that exposed the FBI hiding the air traffic boxes, the data recorders from the planes.
[00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.345]  I mean, it's incredible that this is airing.
[00:01:50.365 --> 00:02:01.196]  So I'm going to play a few minutes of this, come back with Lord Christopher Monckton with his report from Copenhagen, the latest on what's happening with the public formation of world government.
[00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:10.851]  But here's a short clip from the hour-long special that aired last night 10 o'clock Eastern on TruTV, the number one show they've got, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:21.917]  Jesse Ventura sets off alone for a meeting with the man he calls his wild card.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.043]  Alex Jones inhabits the conspiracy world as few others.
[00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:30.505]  He's an expert of world renown.
[00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:32.166]  He knows the players.
[00:02:32.707 --> 00:02:36.930]  He knows the connections, the whistleblowers, and the operatives.
[00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.753]  Most important, he knows the history.
[00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.534]  Alex, good to see you again.
[00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:42.655]  Thanks for meeting me here.
[00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:43.836]  Governor, good to see you.
[00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:45.998]  I believe I may have the information you're looking for.
[00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:46.298]  Good.
[00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.640]  Alex, how do we get to Maurice Strong?
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.361]  He's very hard to get to.
[00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:52.823]  He rarely does interviews.
[00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:54.425]  He jet sets all over the planet.
[00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:55.946]  He's a man without a country.
[00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.328]  He's a major front man for the United Nations.
[00:02:58.368 --> 00:02:59.288]  He's been a high-level U.N.
[00:02:59.308 --> 00:02:59.669]  official.
[00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.131]  He also works closely with the Rockefeller family.
[00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.613]  And he is the person behind the call for all these different global taxes.
[00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:13.315]  The way you get to him is with somebody who 25 years ago worked very close with him, and that's George Hunt.
[00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:13.975]  George Hunt.
[00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:14.916]  Okay.
[00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:16.996]  He is the consummate insider.
[00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:20.458]  He was there at the beginning, at the embryonic formation.
[00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:23.641]  So you're telling me that George Hunt is the key?
[00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:37.536]  He's our man on the inside.
[00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.977]  And you can set up this meeting with George Hunt?
[00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:47.361]  Jesse, I will have George Hunt here for you, in this warehouse, same time, same place tomorrow, if you can meet with him.
[00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:57.027]  He can explain the entire agenda, the move towards world government, the takeover of resources by megacorporations and the shadowy families that control them.
[00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:58.928]  All of it ties together.
[00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:01.950]  These are the people that are behind the European Union.
[00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:04.092]  I'll meet with him, Alex.
[00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:04.653]  Thanks for doing it.
[00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:04.933]  Thank you.
[00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:05.634]  Thank you.
[00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:06.495]  And I'll be here tomorrow.
[00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:06.875]  You bet.
[00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:12.181]  George Hunt had better be here, and he'd better have the goods.
[00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:19.690]  Coming up, he shows up alright.
[00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.874]  The man who makes a direct link between the global warming scare and a plot to rule the world.
[00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:34.720]  Their aims are to create an anxiety about the ecology and global warming and so on.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.221]  They're going to use it to take over the world.
[00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:40.523]  Alright!
[00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:43.145]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is groundbreaking.
[00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:45.307]  Nothing like this has ever aired on television.
[00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:51.740]  I was talking to one of the producers of it, and they can't believe that it's being allowed to be aired.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.121]  This is groundbreaking.
[00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.442]  Lord Christopher Monckton was also in this global warming special.
[00:04:56.682 --> 00:04:58.223]  He's live with us from Copenhagen.
[00:04:58.243 --> 00:04:58.723]  Straight ahead.
[00:04:58.803 --> 00:05:03.985]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:08.487]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:10.508]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:10.908 --> 00:05:12.268]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:13.569]  There is a solution.
[00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:21.811]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:29.293]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:05:29.693 --> 00:05:35.334]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:41.296]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:45.539]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:52.104]  Go to E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com or give them a call right now.
[00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:52.545]  866-762-9238.

[00:05:58.697 --> 00:06:02.939]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:03.860]  Number one.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.322]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:07.582 --> 00:06:08.162]  Number two.
[00:06:08.442 --> 00:06:13.005]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:13.785]  It's true.
[00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:18.628]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:18.948 --> 00:06:19.489]  Number 3.
[00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:23.051]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:27.094]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:27.815]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:30.437]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:34.220]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.720]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:39.224]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:39.444 --> 00:06:44.208]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:48.532]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.234]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:52.536]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:55.039]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:59.161 --> 00:07:01.763]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:02.163 --> 00:07:07.126]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:09.227]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:14.350]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.510]  How much do you want?
[00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:16.471]  When do you want it?
[00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.452]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:19.553]  When will you need it?
[00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:21.874]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:23.115]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:24.656]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:27.257]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:29.938]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:33.359]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:37.221]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:38.521]  How much will you need?
[00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:39.382]  We don't know.
[00:07:39.662 --> 00:07:40.582]  How much do you want?
[00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:41.483]  All you can get.
[00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:42.383]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:45.546]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:46.967]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:53.132]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:56.034]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:56.194 --> 00:08:06.803]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:10.386]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:21.604]  Well, I am really shaken by how powerful Jesse Ventura's Global Warming Special was on TruTV.
[00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:22.485]  Top ratings.
[00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:25.090]  It's the top show they've got on the channel.
[00:08:26.058 --> 00:08:31.703]  That they start out with an open mind and conclude by the end that it's a global government fraud.
[00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:35.947]  They get Ben Santer to admit that he altered UN documents.
[00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:42.412]  See, Climategate is only the latest in what Lord Monckton and others for over a decade have been exposing.
[00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:44.414]  Systematic fraud.
[00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:48.377]  And I just can't believe they allowed this to air.
[00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.900]  I was talking to Michael Braverman.
[00:08:51.877 --> 00:08:52.238]  I don't know.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:15.882]  But it shows that there's a major power struggle going on right now, and a lot of people in the establishment don't want to go into this world dictatorship.
[00:09:15.942 --> 00:09:22.283]  So, major shake-ups happening right now, but I am stunned that this aired.
[00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:27.965]  Lord Christopher Monckton is a big part of the hour-long special.
[00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:33.606]  He hasn't seen it yet, but he joins us for the rest of the hour from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:36.667]  Now into week number two.
[00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:39.228]  Obama and others to speak tomorrow.
[00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:40.928]  The big grand finale.
[00:09:41.508 --> 00:09:43.149]  It ends early next week.
[00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:52.092]  And so joining us from Copenhagen to give us a report on the state of this global government establishment declaration of tyranny.
[00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:56.513]  It looks like it's in trouble, but he's the real expert and is on the ground and can tell us that.
[00:09:56.973 --> 00:10:04.434]  And what their strategy, what their plan B is going to be, I have a good idea, but I want to get it directly from Christopher Monckton.
[00:10:05.134 --> 00:10:06.595]  Sir, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:09.535]  Well, Alex, it's a real pleasure to be with you again.
[00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:11.195]  Thank you.
[00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:12.016]  You're there.
[00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:19.117]  Give us your report on what you've witnessed in the last week and a half and the state of this event.
[00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:24.149]  Well, the first thing is, it's been very like a Nuremberg rally.
[00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:29.754]  The people who come to these things are very nearly all of one mind only.
[00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:47.109]  As a very senior senator from Australia said to me today, this morning, as we were trying to get into the conference, and neither he, a senator from Australia, nor I, a member of the House of Lords in Britain, albeit without a seat or a vote, neither of us could get into the conference today.
[00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:55.383]  Because they were excluding everybody except the delegates and a tiny, tiny token handful of outside observers.
[00:10:55.844 --> 00:11:01.888]  And we, whom they had on their blacklist because we disagreed with what they're trying to do there, were not allowed in.
[00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:10.555]  But what has been going on over the last 10 days is they've been trying to see whether they can get a binding treaty.
[00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:15.059]  And more or less at the outset, they realised they would have to abandon that
[00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:17.227]  Because it would never pass the U.S.
[00:11:17.388 --> 00:11:17.668]  Senate.
[00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:20.630]  If they call it a treaty, it requires two-thirds of the U.S.
[00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.571]  Senate to vote for it.
[00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:29.257]  And there are just too many blue-dog Democrats, as well as sensible Republicans, who will not vote for the destruction of the U.S.
[00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:43.549]  Constitution, for the establishment of a world government, for the bankrupting of the United States, for the destruction of working people's jobs right across the industries of the U.S., all of which will become unprofitable if anything like the original draft treaty had gone through.
[00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:46.877]  The word government has now been dropped from the treaty.
[00:11:47.257 --> 00:12:09.764]  Unfortunately, all of the principles of all of the structures, the democratic structures, I say undemocratic structures, I should say, of bureaucracy that they're going to put in place, these 700 separate new bureaucracies, all interlocking with the Secretariat of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:11.065]  These are the
[00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:15.574]  New entities they're going to bring into being to create this world government.
[00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:39.704]  Those are still in the draft and Ban Ki-moon is clearly expecting, he's the head of the UN, he's clearly expecting that part of the treaty to go through because he is saying we're going to have to set up a structure of global governance just to handle, get this, actually what he admitted yesterday, the enormous amount of money which we are going to be getting from the countries of the West
[00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:42.579]  Once this agreement goes through at Copenhagen.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.322]  So they are expecting to get this through.
[00:12:46.402 --> 00:12:50.725]  So all the reports you see about how the parties are fatally deadlocked.
[00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:52.226]  China has walked out.
[00:12:52.446 --> 00:12:53.988]  The African countries have walked out.
[00:12:54.288 --> 00:12:56.690]  Everybody's complaining at the Danish government handling of it.
[00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.892]  The Danish government says that he can no longer broker an agreement.
[00:13:00.353 --> 00:13:06.097]  All of these things are the traditional window dressing to try to disarm
[00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:11.472]  Those of us who don't want any of this to succeed because we would rather like to preserve.
[00:13:11.512 --> 00:13:12.673]  So they're playing dead.
[00:13:12.733 --> 00:13:13.954]  They're playing possum.
[00:13:14.274 --> 00:13:17.357]  They're acting like they've been defeated.
[00:13:17.437 --> 00:13:28.628]  But you're giving us the dreadful news, Lord Christopher Monckton is, that you believe they will sign this agreement that really is a treaty but on the surface isn't.
[00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.150]  If he tries to do that, he will be impeached.
[00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:37.352]  The great thing about the United States Constitution is that it does not allow the President to rule on his own.
[00:14:00.158 --> 00:14:03.961]  It's very clear that there are three branches of the legislature.
[00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:09.344]  There are the two houses of Congress and there is the executive branch, the president and his cabinet.
[00:14:09.945 --> 00:14:12.727]  And he cannot rule on his own.
[00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:15.408]  If he tries, he will be impeached.
[00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:24.254]  In fact, already there are those in the Republican camp who are beginning to look at the constitutional implications of some of the things the president has been saying.
[00:14:24.634 --> 00:14:26.936]  He had better tread very carefully at the
[00:14:27.369 --> 00:14:30.170]  Well, he will be out of office and in prison before he knows it.
[00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:40.956]  There are constitutional constraints which, thank God, may yet save not only America, but the rest of the world from what you might describe as a tyranny.
[00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:42.776]  That is what they had intended.
[00:14:43.117 --> 00:14:56.283]  And it was I who first revealed this when I got the first draft of this dreadful treaty and revealed its contents to the world in a speech in Minnesota, which has now been seen by four million people on YouTube.
[00:14:56.872 --> 00:15:02.914]  And there's no doubt that this has woken people up to what is really intended here.
[00:15:03.254 --> 00:15:15.739]  And yes, Sir Maurice Strong, whom you mentioned in your introduction, he said 25 years ago that he was intending to turn the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change into a world government.
[00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:20.581]  To that end, he didn't set it up as a scientific body, but as a political body.
[00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.622]  That was his original intention.
[00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:24.242]  And he has stuck to that throughout.
[00:15:24.502 --> 00:15:26.203]  You also mentioned Ben Santer.
[00:15:26.687 --> 00:15:34.551]  Whose various fraudulent attempts to tamper with the scientific reports of the UN I have been exposing over the years.
[00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:46.336]  It was Santa who, on his own, rewrote the 1995 UN report on the climate, which had been submitted by a thousand scientists.
[00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:47.376]  They'd agreed to text.
[00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:55.640]  The bureaucrats were furious that the scientists had said there is no indication of any human influence on global temperature.
[00:15:56.587 --> 00:15:57.788]  They said it five times.
[00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.989]  They said it clearly.
[00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.992]  They said we don't know when such an effect will ever be discernible.
[00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:05.496]  Lord Monckton, for those that don't know, go back.
[00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:11.322]  In the Jesse Ventura special, but for years, you've been exposing Ben Santer.
[00:16:11.602 --> 00:16:16.507]  Tell people who he is at the UN, the direct deputy, the minion of Maurice Strong.
[00:16:16.547 --> 00:16:19.109]  People that don't know who Maurice Strong is.
[00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:25.712]  And he's now in this TV show, Ben Santer, admitting that he did excise that out.
[00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:27.813]  So another huge climate gate.
[00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.574]  I mean, what is new to the public is new.
[00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:40.857]  This may be old news to people who've been researching it like you, but this is a whole other climate gate directly from the UN, where they're engaged in fraud.
[00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:42.538]  That is exactly it.
[00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:44.759]  What we have clearly got here in this 1995 episode
[00:16:46.112 --> 00:16:52.036]  Which Sir John Horton, who was chairman of the UN at the time, of the Climate Plan at the time, tried to deny had ever happened.
[00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:54.638]  He said he was unaware of any rewriting.
[00:16:54.938 --> 00:17:05.385]  He, in fact, knew perfectly well that this had been done, because he and others at the UN have later said, oh, but this was entirely within the UN's procedure.
[00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:11.890]  One man could rewrite the UN's report and say exactly the opposite of what the scientists
[00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:15.029]  That's what the bureaucrats wanted.
[00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.230]  They didn't want the scientists to say there wasn't a problem.
[00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.933]  Otherwise, this UN climate panel would be closed down and there'd be no world government.
[00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:25.255]  So they got Santa to rewrite it.
[00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:28.558]  And he's now admitted on television that that is what he did.
[00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:30.619]  I believe it's the first time he has admitted it.
[00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:33.681]  But I had the proof long ago that he's done this.
[00:17:34.201 --> 00:17:35.142]  I've been saying so.
[00:17:35.202 --> 00:17:41.326]  In fact, I've done a tour of European Parliament in which I have revealed exactly which bits of the
[00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:42.302]  I think.
[00:17:59.068 --> 00:18:12.995]  In the UN's next report after 1995, which was in 2001, they had to abolish that because while it was plainly warmer in the medieval warm period than today, they couldn't say there was anything exceptional about today's temperature.
[00:18:13.235 --> 00:18:20.278]  The 1990 UN report had shown a graph showing that the medieval warm period was one or two degrees Celsius warmer than today.
[00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:22.799]  That's three or four Fahrenheit.
[00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.700]  And by 2001, they'd swept that away.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.802]  It's the same team connected to Ben Santa by these emails at Climate Case.
[00:18:29.178 --> 00:18:29.918]  Who had done that.
[00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:45.608]  And then in the 2007 report they produced a bogus graph pretending that the rate of increase in temperatures over the past 150 years has itself been accelerating ever more rapidly as you come closer to the present.
[00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:49.071]  Now that graph was bogus and it was in fact fraudulent.
[00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:53.894]  And I saw Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC,
[00:18:54.944 --> 00:19:02.465]  At a lecture at the University of Copenhagen two nights ago, using that bogus graph, which he knew was bogus.
[00:19:02.965 --> 00:19:11.567]  And so I stood up at the end of his lecture, and I gave him a letter, which I had written to him, explaining why this graph was bogus.
[00:19:12.147 --> 00:19:14.387]  And I said to him, this graph is a fraud.
[00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:20.368]  You are participating in a fraud by using material of this kind, which has long been discredited.
[00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:24.189]  And the fact that you're still using it is an extremely serious matter.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.832]  And he was very upset and he said, oh, but you know, to use the word fraud, that's a very unparliamentary word, you shouldn't use it.
[00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:34.639]  But he had absolutely no way of answering the point I had made.
[00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:37.734]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest.
[00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:58.143]  I want to, in layman's terms, sir, go over the state of the attempt at world government at getting 190 nations lined up to sign on to a private UN slash World Bank IMF dictatorship where we pay Maury Strong and Al Gore and David Rockefeller for carbon credits.
[00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.498]  Listen carefully to this message.
[00:20:00.878 --> 00:20:04.081]  If you're about to buy hardwood flooring, you're going to pay too much.
[00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:05.882]  Unless, of course, you buy from us.
[00:20:06.042 --> 00:20:11.245]  We're lumber liquidators and no one, including those big box stores, can sell wood flooring for less.
[00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:17.469]  When you buy your quality hardwood flooring from lumber liquidators, you save hundreds, if not thousands, every time.
[00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.351]  Because we buy direct from the mills.
[00:20:19.631 --> 00:20:21.652]  We are truly the wood floor experts.

[00:20:50.128 --> 00:20:50.188]  1-800-580-5740.
[00:20:58.872 --> 00:21:00.894]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:01.834]  Spy on me?
[00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:02.195]  Yeah.
[00:21:02.235 --> 00:21:07.138]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.740]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.540]  Startpage?
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.001]  Yeah.
[00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.061]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:13.984]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:14.124 --> 00:21:17.847]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:18.007 --> 00:21:20.869]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:23.470]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.230]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:25.550]  Right!

[00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:29.472]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:29.512 --> 00:21:30.492]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:34.393]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:38.354]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:21:59.338 --> 00:22:00.179]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:05.703]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:05.904 --> 00:22:06.324]  I get it.
[00:22:06.444 --> 00:22:15.832]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:16.072 --> 00:22:17.173]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:17.473 --> 00:22:25.719]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:25.939 --> 00:22:29.202]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:29.342 --> 00:22:33.425]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:33.605 --> 00:22:35.166]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:35.206 --> 00:22:38.449]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:42.772]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:42.972 --> 00:22:43.692]  You should, too.
[00:22:43.872 --> 00:22:44.833]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:45.013 --> 00:22:48.374]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:48.394 --> 00:22:48.674]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.694 --> 00:22:48.754]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.794 --> 00:22:49.095]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:49.115 --> 00:22:50.375]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:53.336]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[00:23:05.197 --> 00:23:09.420]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.083]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[00:23:15.743 --> 00:23:18.165]  Patriotfood.com.
[00:23:18.185 --> 00:23:22.628]  135 pounds of long-lasting, dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[00:23:23.308 --> 00:23:28.031]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[00:23:29.062 --> 00:23:34.903]  And survivalistseeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[00:23:35.423 --> 00:23:39.024]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[00:23:39.444 --> 00:23:45.305]  That's over four pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:49.646]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:53.967]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[00:23:54.487 --> 00:23:57.008]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[00:23:59.523 --> 00:24:04.667]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:05.348 --> 00:24:07.649]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:14.315]  I was talking to Lord Monton during the break about some of the things I want to cover in the time we have left with him in the shower.
[00:24:16.553 --> 00:24:20.276]  How they're trying to implement this global government takeover by stealth right now.
[00:24:20.296 --> 00:24:23.980]  Schwarzenegger says they're going to take over counties, cities, and states.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.081]  That's already going on.
[00:24:26.482 --> 00:24:34.589]  But then I said I also want to talk about how I keep seeing UN police assault or grab reporters that ask questions, even accredited reporters.
[00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:41.192]  And live on Fox News, the maker of Al Gore, Not Evil, Just Wrong, which is really a whitewash, by the way.
[00:24:41.252 --> 00:24:42.073]  He is pure evil.
[00:24:42.553 --> 00:24:43.473]  He's a fraud.
[00:24:43.513 --> 00:24:45.634]  He's a would-be slave master.
[00:24:46.154 --> 00:24:48.215]  That guy got hit in the head by a bottle.
[00:24:48.235 --> 00:24:51.356]  I mean, they are really attacking people.
[00:24:51.396 --> 00:24:58.339]  And Lord Monckton told me he was assaulted by a police officer, knocked to the ground, and had to have the attention of a medic.
[00:24:58.419 --> 00:25:01.781]  So, Lord Monckton, you described it.
[00:25:03.106 --> 00:25:13.671]  Luckily, I brought up the point of the assaults of people that don't follow the new Hitlerian religion, but tell us what happened to yourself and others.
[00:25:14.611 --> 00:25:29.978]  Well, I was with Senator Steve Fielding from Australia and other members of the group from the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which is a sensible environmental pressure group, and we were all accredited members of this conference.
[00:25:30.078 --> 00:25:32.499]  We were entitled to go into the conference.
[00:25:32.867 --> 00:25:48.231]  However, yesterday and again today, we were turned away by the UN on the flimsiest of grounds, because there had been a demonstration by members of other non-governmental organisations totally unconnected with us.
[00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:51.091]  Demonstrations, in fact, in a completely opposite direction from us.
[00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:58.873]  But they therefore decided they would exclude everyone, even those whom they had invited, as they had us, and accredited to this conference.
[00:25:59.508 --> 00:26:04.972]  So when it was plain that we weren't going to be allowed in, the police said, would you please leave?
[00:26:05.012 --> 00:26:06.693]  And they began manhandling me.
[00:26:06.733 --> 00:26:09.054]  So I said, I put my hand in my pocket.
[00:26:09.775 --> 00:26:10.936]  First thing you should do.
[00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:13.417]  I was trained in this by the John Abbot years ago.
[00:26:13.978 --> 00:26:17.100]  If the police start to get cratchy, as they do.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.761]  This is the Danish police under orders from the UN.
[00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:21.062]  That's the way it works.
[00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:23.184]  This new world government is already taking shape.
[00:26:24.524 --> 00:26:26.205]  They manhandled me physically.
[00:26:26.226 --> 00:26:28.487]  And I said, you will take your hands off me.
[00:26:29.472 --> 00:26:32.974]  And they then did, and the policeman said, you know, you're a very unpleasant man.
[00:26:33.014 --> 00:26:37.255]  I said, no, I'm just not used to being manhandled, and please don't do it.
[00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:48.580]  And I went where he wanted me to go, turned my back on him and began to walk away, and he hit me very hard from behind, knocking me to the ground and knocking me out.
[00:26:50.415 --> 00:26:51.716]  Excuse me, excuse me, sir.
[00:26:52.156 --> 00:27:04.626]  A member of the House of Lords, the third Viscount of Moncton and Brentley, and you're being assaulted by UN-controlled thugs attacked from behind.
[00:27:05.146 --> 00:27:07.608]  Again, no one is safe from this tyranny.
[00:27:08.449 --> 00:27:09.290]  No, that's right.
[00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.152]  It was a very disfiguring episode.
[00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:17.272]  And I had done nothing to provoke this, except to say, please don't manhandle me.
[00:27:17.332 --> 00:27:18.333]  There was no need for that.
[00:27:18.393 --> 00:27:19.154]  We were on our way.
[00:27:19.194 --> 00:27:20.535]  So he knocked you out?
[00:27:20.975 --> 00:27:22.857]  I mean, you were knocked unconscious?
[00:27:22.877 --> 00:27:31.845]  And then apparently, I'm told, because I was then out for, I don't know, I don't know how long I was out for, but anyway, when I came around, there were lots of concerned faces standing around.
[00:27:32.225 --> 00:27:40.292]  And apparently, while I'd been knocked out, so my friends who were around me, one of them kindly cradling my head to stop it being banging on the ground again,
[00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:42.946]  They were saying, oh yes, he's just making it up.
[00:27:42.966 --> 00:27:43.666]  He's just faking it.
[00:27:44.407 --> 00:28:03.796]  Anyway, the kindly, the excellent equivalent of John Ambulance, the Danish volunteer ambulance man, came and took me away and looked after me in their ambulance for 20 minutes and put a blanket on me and warmed me up and gave me some water to drink and checked my pulse and made sure I was coherent and all right again.
[00:28:04.696 --> 00:28:07.718]  They were very, very good and I made a wee donation to their
[00:28:08.288 --> 00:28:08.888]  Well, that's right.
[00:28:08.908 --> 00:28:14.832]  He was a police officer who, I think, let's be fair to them, they were under pressure from the very nasty goons who are the UN police force, the Danish police.
[00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.011]  I don't
[00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:52.022]  Didn't know where to turn.
[00:28:52.302 --> 00:28:57.684]  In the end he just decided he would take a swipe at me and unfortunately knocked me to the ground and knocked me out.
[00:28:57.704 --> 00:29:01.026]  Did he hit you with a belly club in the head, sir?
[00:29:01.046 --> 00:29:02.347]  No, no, no, no.
[00:29:02.787 --> 00:29:07.189]  It was just, I mean, he had a glove in his hand and he pushed me a little too hard in the back.
[00:29:11.186 --> 00:29:24.651]  I would be locked up for assaulting a police officer, no doubt about it at all, and I'd be sent home in disgrace and never allowed back into Denmark again.
[00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:27.912]  He will get off scot-free and probably be given a promotion.
[00:29:28.232 --> 00:29:29.613]  That's the way it now is.
[00:29:30.513 --> 00:29:32.494]  So I do feel some sympathy for him.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.104]  He was under a lot of pressure from them, and of course we had been trying to get into the conference, but he was under a certain amount of pressure.
[00:29:38.244 --> 00:29:39.585]  All right, Lord Monckton, stay there.
[00:29:39.686 --> 00:29:43.449]  I want to get into all the other areas to cover in a long segment coming up.
[00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:45.510]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.213]  We've got your website up on screen.
[00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:49.874]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.314 --> 00:29:51.896]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.836 --> 00:29:55.539]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:03.398]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:03.518 --> 00:30:07.884]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:08.064 --> 00:30:09.907]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:10.327 --> 00:30:11.689]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:12.991]  There is a solution.
[00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:21.235]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:30:58.168 --> 00:31:05.012]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:31:05.132 --> 00:31:07.093]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:02.123]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:02.423 --> 00:32:03.043]  Number one.
[00:32:03.343 --> 00:32:06.504]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:06.765 --> 00:32:07.345]  Number two.
[00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:12.187]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:12.527 --> 00:32:12.967]  It's true.
[00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:17.809]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:18.670]  Number 3.
[00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.253]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:22.534 --> 00:32:26.278]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:27.018]  Number 4.
[00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:29.641]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:30.022 --> 00:32:33.425]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:33.705 --> 00:32:33.906]  Number 5.
[00:32:34.466 --> 00:32:38.390]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:43.395]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:43.675 --> 00:32:47.719]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:49.421]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:54.246]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:15.999 --> 00:33:18.682]  Well, I had to squeeze the information out of Lord Mocton.
[00:33:18.722 --> 00:33:23.107]  He's too gentlemanly to really tell you what happened to him, but he's caught up.
[00:33:25.257 --> 00:33:28.039]  And really, really got thrashed to the ground bad.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.583]  And he is filing a complaint through someone he knows in the Danish Parliament.
[00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:37.287]  And we need to not forgive police when they assault us from behind.
[00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:49.598]  Because if this is allowed to continue, next they'll be snatching and grabbing us, like what happened at the G20 a few months ago, where uniformed military were snatching and grabbing peaceful protesters off the streets.
[00:33:49.658 --> 00:33:52.000]  Lord Monckton, I know you don't want to spend too much more time on this,
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.023]  But finishing up, any other comments about how you were assaulted and how the UN?
[00:33:57.043 --> 00:34:04.788]  I mean, I've seen countless videos of accredited reporters, if they ask about Climategate, armed UN police drag them away.
[00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:11.232]  The climate cultist on the streets, if anyone
[00:34:12.481 --> 00:34:21.405]  I mean, video after video, we have multiple videos posted on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com today, where people are being interviewed and they say, well, I question man-made climate change.
[00:34:21.805 --> 00:34:23.266]  I think climate gain is important.
[00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:28.909]  Bottles and rocks and apples begin hitting them in the face and hissing, attacking.
[00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:34.271]  I mean, these are authoritarian thugs, not just the police, not just the UN.
[00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:39.534]  I mean, the acolytes of this, when you talk about Nuremberg electric
[00:34:40.174 --> 00:34:40.695]  Atmosphere
[00:34:57.731 --> 00:35:00.474]  Well, I think we're covering quite a lot of ground there, starting off with
[00:35:21.405 --> 00:35:24.968]  I think what we must put into perspective is a relatively small incident.
[00:35:25.028 --> 00:35:31.314]  I mean, OK, yes, I'm a peer of the realm, but I know policemen shouldn't be going around bashing people in the back.
[00:35:31.634 --> 00:35:35.778]  But I think the poor guy hadn't realized that he sort of overdid it a bit.
[00:35:35.838 --> 00:35:37.620]  He hadn't intended to knock me to the ground.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:43.906]  It was just unfortunate that I was in a particular position where when he hit me, I tripped over and fell flat on my face.
[00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:45.267]  I don't think he meant it.
[00:35:46.236 --> 00:35:51.438]  I do think he should have, having been warned not to put his hands on me, he shouldn't have done that.
[00:35:51.538 --> 00:36:00.162]  And I think in due course he will be disciplined and probably put down a rank for a year or two to remind him that you don't treat people that way.
[00:36:00.642 --> 00:36:03.143]  So let's not over-magnify that.
[00:36:03.643 --> 00:36:13.427]  And I do feel a lot of sympathy for Danish police in that they are clearly being under orders from the very, very nasty, flinty-faced
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.240]  I think we're good to go.
[00:36:41.573 --> 00:36:49.095]  Laying in, not just to our side, to be clear, but also to demonstrators from the other side, with Trump's, I mean, they've been bashing them.
[00:36:49.896 --> 00:36:52.676]  And that's also been shown on television worldwide.
[00:36:53.197 --> 00:37:00.899]  And it has led me and others to comment that perhaps the Danes and the UN don't quite understand what being in a democracy is all about.
[00:37:01.479 --> 00:37:10.622]  So moving on from that, then to Schwarzenegger and him saying that this is such a pressing problem that he's going to circumvent the government.
[00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.976]  I don't think he'll get away with that.
[00:37:13.036 --> 00:37:17.958]  He too could find himself impeached if he tries to go against the US Constitution.
[00:37:18.158 --> 00:37:33.165]  The Constitution is there, and we now see what an important document it is, regarded by Obama and his people, and they said this during the election campaign, as a piece of paper that is now an obstacle to what the left wishes to achieve internationally.
[00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:38.028]  And Schwarzenegger, although he's nominally a Republican, is clearly more and more identifying
[00:37:39.412 --> 00:37:45.133]  Effectively, and I'm going to use the word, the communist left that are now running America, and much else in the world.
[00:37:45.533 --> 00:38:00.316]  And I think what we have to do is to say that if anybody breaks the law in the way that Schwarzenegger is supposed to, then however high and senior they may be in their local area, they will be taken to task and taken, if necessary, to court for that.
[00:38:00.796 --> 00:38:02.896]  So I don't think that he's going to get away with that.
[00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:06.737]  I think that mere rodomontade of the sort that you get at these conferences
[00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:08.094]  Well, yes sir, but I mean...
[00:38:22.665 --> 00:38:24.086]  Lord Monckton, here's a quick example.
[00:38:24.686 --> 00:38:40.472]  He couldn't get the Legislature of California to pass taxes on all televisions and ban them above 40 inches, saying he's the Gropenfuhrer, the Grupfuhrer, he's going to decide as the Gow-Lighter what type of TV you can have.
[00:38:40.692 --> 00:38:44.073]  So he just ordered the California Department of Energy to do it by fiat.
[00:38:45.934 --> 00:38:49.196]  He is calling for a summit of mayors, and the U.N.
[00:38:49.236 --> 00:38:52.858]  had a summit of mayors there, to have the cities levy the taxes.
[00:38:53.259 --> 00:38:54.299]  A bunch of other U.S.
[00:38:54.339 --> 00:38:55.240]  cities are doing this.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:06.807]  I know some of the governments in England, I mean, in the United States, and it's the same all over the Western world, for those that don't know, you have the federal government, you have the state governments, and cities and counties
[00:39:07.267 --> 00:39:10.228]  Right, and you're quite right, and the way to do that
[00:39:37.623 --> 00:39:48.785]  ...is to make sure that any state or local organisation that oversteps its powers is taken to court under the ultravirism.
[00:39:49.085 --> 00:39:51.146]  That means anything that is beyond your powers.
[00:39:51.286 --> 00:39:54.166]  Ultravirism, that's the court phrase.
[00:39:55.067 --> 00:39:56.487]  You aren't allowed to do that.
[00:39:56.947 --> 00:40:02.028]  And it is not permissible for local administrations to levy federal taxes.
[00:40:03.736 --> 00:40:13.823]  So if they try to start playing that game, all it takes is one good bit to take them to court, to the federal court, and say, look, this is not allowed, is it?
[00:40:14.184 --> 00:40:15.985]  The federal court will look at it and say, no, it isn't.
[00:40:16.746 --> 00:40:23.631]  And they will impose whatever penalties are necessary, whatever orders of the court are necessary, to stop the local administration doing this.
[00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:29.055]  So you do still have a constitution in the United States that basically works.
[00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:52.061]  And if anyone, like the EPA or local government or state government, try to overtop the rights of the US legislature to make and unmake the laws that you elected them to make and unmake, then you will be defending your democracy if you take them to court and say, we will not have this imposed upon us.
[00:40:52.321 --> 00:40:59.084]  We are doing this in the UK all the time because we recently had our local government trying to impose some damn full tax on us.
[00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:00.731]  I don't think so.
[00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:15.920]  And they were so frightened that they said, OK, we'll leave you alone.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:21.341]  So clearly, when you stand up and fight to this illegal strategy, they fold.
[00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:23.241]  But the question is, will we stand and fight?
[00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.122]  Now, I want to get into strategy.
[00:41:26.142 --> 00:41:39.745]  In layman's terms, you're probably the leading expert in the world, not just on the science from studying it and interviewing all the scientists, but on how their fraud works, how their organization works, how their propaganda works, how their bureaucracy, their takeover by stealth works.
[00:41:40.425 --> 00:41:47.612]  Specifically, Lord Christopher Monckton, joining us live in the final days, the climax of the summit tomorrow into next week.
[00:41:48.312 --> 00:41:51.815]  Specifically, you're saying that they are going to get an agreement.
[00:41:52.136 --> 00:41:53.657]  It's going to be a stealth agreement.
[00:41:54.538 --> 00:42:04.547]  Explain that to us and what you expect to happen tomorrow with Obama and what we can do understanding their cloaked attack profile.
[00:42:05.487 --> 00:42:05.728]  Right.
[00:42:05.768 --> 00:42:07.049]  The first thing they will do
[00:42:07.771 --> 00:42:18.357]  And the one thing that I think they were always going to succeed in doing at this conference is to agree to establish what will be delicately called the institutional framework.
[00:42:18.977 --> 00:42:21.098]  Now, that is a code word for world government.
[00:42:22.059 --> 00:42:25.320]  They're no longer calling it world government because they tried that.
[00:42:25.801 --> 00:42:26.501]  I spotted it.
[00:42:27.061 --> 00:42:28.002]  I publicized it.
[00:42:28.302 --> 00:42:30.163]  The world went, ah, we're not having that.
[00:42:30.743 --> 00:42:36.026]  And so they've been, they're beaten off from using the word, but they're going to keep the structure.
[00:42:36.485 --> 00:42:53.832]  They're going to use this conference, the agreement that they will reach here, to set up the institutional framework, which means in effect the world government, and they're going to take from the Western countries the very large financial resources required to do that.
[00:42:54.673 --> 00:42:59.935]  That's the one thing they are definitely going to succeed in doing here, and they will announce
[00:43:00.808 --> 00:43:02.109]  As a victory in itself.
[00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:09.355]  And they will be right, because that is the one and only single aim of this entire global warming nonsense.
[00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:15.741]  It is to establish the mechanism, the structure, and above all, the funding for a world government.
[00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:18.443]  And that is what they're going to get agreement for.
[00:43:18.823 --> 00:43:23.667]  And they will disguise it by saying we're setting up a $10 billion fund or $100 billion fund for
[00:43:25.882 --> 00:43:29.004]  Adaptation to climate change in third world countries.
[00:43:29.264 --> 00:43:35.908]  But actually, this money will almost all be gobbled up by the international bureaucracy.
[00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:46.975]  And because of the way that governments now hide from their people, how it is they're spending the people's money, and exactly how much is going to international organisations.
[00:43:47.256 --> 00:43:52.619]  When I had a question put down in the House of Lords about how much Britain has given to the UN Climate Panel over the years,
[00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:56.509]  The answer I got was, we do not have this information.
[00:43:56.669 --> 00:43:59.951]  Well, of course they have the information, but they're not going to tell us.
[00:44:00.512 --> 00:44:05.036]  And the difficulty will be in finding out what they are actually doing.
[00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:21.869]  But if they declare that they are going to do this and they don't have the constitutional authority to do it, and that will certainly be the case in the United States, then it is possible for you in the United States to fight it and stop them paying the money to this organisation.
[00:44:22.438 --> 00:44:26.139]  Unless it can be shown that they have the constitutional authority to do it.
[00:44:26.679 --> 00:44:28.199]  Absolutely, Lord Monaghan!
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:34.921]  They don't have that constitutional authority unless this is a treaty and unless it is ratified by the Senate.
[00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:49.044]  So, I think that with luck, anything that comes out in just the form of an executive agreement will be something which you can overthrow and defeat and say no to.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:45:07.747]  Even though the Supreme Court will bend over backwards to do what Obama wants, in the end it does have to uphold the Constitution and it can't, I think, countenance the circumvention of the Constitution by the Executive Agreement procedure on a treaty with such major financial and political implications as this.
[00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:14.358]  Okay, Lord Christopher Monckton, again, sorry to be interrupting, but I want to move into some other areas and get your expertise on them.
[00:45:15.339 --> 00:45:16.681]  I want to play a short clip.
[00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:20.987]  This is a story up on PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net.
[00:45:21.328 --> 00:45:23.050]  Steve Watson out of the UK wrote it.
[00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:24.392]  Rothschild.
[00:45:27.113 --> 00:45:32.214]  Talks about the difficulty of global government's agenda at Copenhagen.
[00:45:32.234 --> 00:45:35.195]  So he talks about the difficulty of selling this.
[00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:52.618]  So, I want to play the clip and then ask you, Lord Monckton, why did they deny world government for so long when it was in their own documents, then they came out in the last couple months and admitted, okay, it's global government, run by private groups, and then now they're retreating from that but still pushing the agenda.
[00:45:53.338 --> 00:45:55.219]  It appears on the surface that they are
[00:45:56.286 --> 00:46:07.666]  Really beginning to show real signs of stress and that this is a mortal wound that ClimateGate is literally hemorrhaging all of their support.
[00:46:07.947 --> 00:46:09.349]  But here is the short clip.
[00:46:10.297 --> 00:46:11.598]  It's past the point of talking.
[00:46:12.178 --> 00:46:21.664]  We know historically that the global governance agenda to these issues is very hard to try and, with all the best intentions, it's very hard to actually activate.
[00:46:22.185 --> 00:46:23.085]  We're seeing that right now.
[00:46:23.105 --> 00:46:28.128]  We're seeing a lot of fragmentation going on in Copenhagen, a lot of different agendas pulling in different directions.
[00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:36.494]  And I think what we really need to see is people on the ground starting to actually act upon the low-hanging fruit and start to try and move on the solutions that we have at hand.
[00:46:37.515 --> 00:46:39.036]  Okay, so that's the headline.
[00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.477]  Rothschild ruse.
[00:46:40.557 --> 00:46:44.120]  Difficulty of advancing global governance agenda at Copenhagen.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.581]  That was on Bloomberg Television.
[00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:46.181]  Lord Monckton.
[00:46:47.162 --> 00:46:49.304]  Yeah, I think he's right.
[00:46:49.384 --> 00:46:51.045]  I think they are finding it difficult.
[00:46:51.405 --> 00:46:53.006]  Because they got caught out.
[00:46:53.507 --> 00:46:57.750]  You see, let's remember how they hid this treaty with the word government in it.
[00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:04.635]  What they did was they put it on the website of the Conference of the States party for the trade work convention on climate change.
[00:47:05.185 --> 00:47:08.166]  But they called it a note by the Secretariat.
[00:47:08.727 --> 00:47:12.168]  And it was only a vigilant friend of mine who realised it was too large.
[00:47:12.348 --> 00:47:14.069]  It's just a note by the Secretariat.
[00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:15.230]  Too big a file.
[00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:19.051]  He opened it and found this treaty buried at the back of the note.
[00:47:19.071 --> 00:47:21.852]  186 pages at the back of a two-page note.
[00:47:22.353 --> 00:47:32.357]  And there, in it, when I read it, was this business in annex 1 of paragraph 36-38 about a world government that was going to take over all the financial and other markets.
[00:47:32.417 --> 00:47:33.978]  There'd be no such thing as a free market anymore.
[00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:35.131]  I think so, yes.
[00:47:57.887 --> 00:48:06.649]  Because it was publicised and because, particularly in the United States, people stood up and got in touch with their legislators and said, we are not having this.
[00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:08.609]  This treaty shall not pass.
[00:48:09.569 --> 00:48:14.050]  It became really impossible for them to get away with it in the way that they had originally hoped.
[00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:26.473]  They still hope that by making it an agreement, by taking out the word government, but by leaving in all the institutional framework, which is what they're now calling the world government, they might still get away with it.
[00:48:26.989 --> 00:48:44.300]  And now what Rothschild is saying is even that is proving problematic because there are so many pressures, particularly from ordinary Americans getting in touch with their legislators, using their last few days of democracy and freedom to fight to keep it that way.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.182]  That is what, above all else, has helped derail
[00:48:52.059 --> 00:49:04.868]  We just lost our guest, so we will reconnect with him as soon as we can.
[00:49:04.888 --> 00:49:10.212]  That actually sounded like a power outage to me.
[00:49:11.733 --> 00:49:15.096]  We'll get Lord Monckton back on the line with us.
[00:49:15.116 --> 00:49:17.518]  Having a lot of phone troubles lately.
[00:49:20.021 --> 00:49:20.761]  But think about it.
[00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:29.625]  World government is now out in the open and they go on international Bloomberg TV and say, oh yes, people don't like our global governance, so we've got to go with the low-lying fruit.
[00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:33.166]  And what is the low-lying fruit?
[00:49:34.186 --> 00:49:39.548]  We're going to ask Lord Monckton that question now.
[00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:41.529]  Sir, can you hear me again?
[00:49:42.202 --> 00:49:42.762]  Yes, I can.
[00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:43.302]  Loud and clear.
[00:49:43.682 --> 00:49:48.224]  Okay, well, the miracle of technology, we're talking to you in Europe, we're here in the United States.
[00:49:48.624 --> 00:49:50.745]  What is the low-lying fruit he's talking about?
[00:49:50.805 --> 00:50:02.248]  Is that what you're discussing of how they're going to do this by stealth, through the bureaucracy, and through just getting national governments to just give tax money to this body, like they've been doing in the past?
[00:50:03.008 --> 00:50:03.568]  That's right.
[00:50:03.648 --> 00:50:09.550]  What they'll do is they'll start with the institutional framework, this is the world government structure,
[00:50:09.983 --> 00:50:24.695]  Because that doesn't require any agreement about how much the Western countries will pay towards the poor countries, how much money the poor countries will get, how much CO2 emissions Western countries will have to reduce, ditto, ditto.
[00:50:25.015 --> 00:50:27.737]  All of that difficult stuff, they won't do.
[00:50:28.017 --> 00:50:33.742]  They will do the easy bit, and the easy bit, bureaucratically, is always to agree to set up a bureaucracy.
[00:50:34.102 --> 00:50:36.404]  All bureaucracies are very good at setting up new bureaucracies.
[00:50:36.966 --> 00:50:40.407]  So that's what he means by low-hanging fruit.
[00:50:40.447 --> 00:50:43.729]  He means, let's set up the world government.
[00:50:44.189 --> 00:50:45.549]  And that's what they're going to do.
[00:50:45.649 --> 00:50:49.251]  And I think that's the one outcome which is more or less guaranteed.
[00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.212]  From tomorrow's final negotiation.
[00:50:52.252 --> 00:50:54.393]  But this conference is actually due to end tomorrow.
[00:50:54.674 --> 00:50:57.216]  It will, in fact, go into an all-night session.

[00:51:51.104 --> 00:51:52.365]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:08.883 --> 00:52:11.546]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:11.566 --> 00:52:17.792]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:17.952 --> 00:52:22.996]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:23.137 --> 00:52:26.280]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:33.126]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:33.246 --> 00:52:35.347]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:35.587 --> 00:52:36.908]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:37.168 --> 00:52:39.449]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:39.629 --> 00:52:41.469]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.572]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:20.798 --> 00:53:21.999]  Where have they been all of our life?

[00:54:14.966 --> 00:54:17.767]  Well, Lord Christopher Monckton has been very, very gracious to be with us.
[00:54:17.807 --> 00:54:19.307]  He has another interview coming up.
[00:54:19.327 --> 00:54:21.647]  He'll be with us five minutes into the next hour.
[00:54:22.007 --> 00:54:25.148]  So, specifically, the talks are in trouble.
[00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:36.370]  They are somewhat of a failure, but you're saying they will get their structure of global government, and that is a great defeat to Liberty, but we then need to oppose it.
[00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:39.150]  You're saying, really, the final day is tomorrow.
[00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.451]  It may go into Saturday.
[00:54:40.751 --> 00:54:42.211]  Lord Monckton, explain that to us.
[00:54:43.237 --> 00:54:49.434]  Yes, tomorrow is the final full day of the conference, and the way the script for these things usually works...
[00:54:50.003 --> 00:54:54.386]  As I said earlier, we've had the leaked document by the Danish government at the beginning.
[00:54:54.446 --> 00:54:55.848]  That's part of the standard script.
[00:54:55.888 --> 00:54:59.370]  We've had the delegations walking out, first the Africans, then the Chinese.
[00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.031]  That's part of the standard script.
[00:55:01.312 --> 00:55:03.954]  Then we've had the demonstrations with the function-wielding police.
[00:55:04.014 --> 00:55:05.795]  That happened earlier this week.
[00:55:06.115 --> 00:55:07.076]  That's part of the script.
[00:55:07.376 --> 00:55:12.060]  Then we have the endless news that it's all going to be a complete failure and nothing will be agreed to at all.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.781]  That's part of the standard script.
[00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:16.143]  Then we will get, and you heard it here first,
[00:55:16.445 --> 00:55:16.605]  I think.
[00:55:35.171 --> 00:55:41.316]  They will agree on the one thing which is what the UN has wanted all along, and Maurice Strong has wanted all along.
[00:55:41.536 --> 00:55:52.864]  They will agree on what is being called the institutional framework, but which is actually these interlocking bureaucracies, very expensive and very powerful, that will constitute the world government.
[00:55:53.325 --> 00:55:57.588]  Once they've got the bureaucracies in place, they will gradually, by successive
[00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:04.184]  But if they can't get the United States Senate to sign on, then how do they get it through?
[00:56:04.284 --> 00:56:10.247]  I guess they just continue by stealth, death by a thousand cuts, just like EU expansion was built.
[00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:30.772]  They'll do it, first of all, with all the countries that do agree.
[00:56:31.452 --> 00:56:39.355]  And then the United States will find herself isolated, that'll be the game, and under huge pressure on Obama to conform.
[00:56:40.256 --> 00:56:54.262]  He will then try to find ways of covertly funding it, and he finds that he can't do that, because I think the Republicans in the Senate in particular have woken up to the dangers now, and they're going to fight him if he tries anything unconstitutional.
[00:56:55.498 --> 00:57:05.862]  But eventually the hope will be that if you put the bureaucracy there, you get all the other nations to start funding it, eventually you will get a US administration that will just get too tired of resisting.
[00:57:07.103 --> 00:57:11.186]  So we need to get on the offensive and start removing their bureaucracy.
[00:57:11.446 --> 00:57:18.951]  So overall, is ClimateGate, is this year's Copenhagen, what the UN called the most important meeting ever, is this a defeat for them?
[00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:20.272]  A setback?
[00:57:21.413 --> 00:57:26.797]  I mean, as a general, in 60 seconds, to the troops, Lord Monckton, what is our situation?
[00:57:27.417 --> 00:57:29.518]  What is your report, your briefing to us?
[00:57:30.659 --> 00:57:31.960]  What is the state of our fight?
[00:57:33.021 --> 00:57:34.142]  My briefing to you is this.
[00:57:34.462 --> 00:57:36.243]  World government is coming.
[00:57:37.014 --> 00:57:40.537]  Because the leaders of the West have given up.
[00:57:41.238 --> 00:57:42.959]  They no longer care about democracy.
[00:57:43.339 --> 00:57:45.921]  They no longer care about the truth about the climate.
[00:57:46.382 --> 00:57:56.590]  They are willing to go along with this world government because they see roles for themselves in that world government in exactly the same way as the leaders of the EU did.
[00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:04.877]  And we saw them squabbling just a few weeks ago over who was going to become the first permanent president of this ghastly dictatorial entity.
[00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:13.873]  Because they were going to get more power as president of the EU without ever having to face an election than they would ever have at home.
[00:58:14.273 --> 00:58:16.334]  And the same thing is the case here.
[00:58:16.794 --> 00:58:27.658]  And I think the way we can attack this world government, which is going to be set up, and they are going to get away with that, is to demand that unless it is an elected government, we will have no party.
[00:58:29.466 --> 00:58:30.027]  Absolutely.
[00:58:30.067 --> 00:58:33.131]  We'll come back with the final five minutes and continue with Solutions.
[00:58:33.711 --> 00:58:37.476]  And ask Lord Monckton, was he able to wake up any of these climate cultists?
[00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:43.263]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.283 --> 00:58:45.065]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.724 --> 00:58:53.345]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:53.665 --> 00:59:01.807]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:02.547 --> 00:59:06.568]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:07.168 --> 00:59:17.990]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:27.633]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:28.133 --> 00:59:33.175]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:33.555 --> 00:59:40.738]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:41.038 --> 00:59:43.459]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:50.914 --> 00:59:52.837]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:53.318 --> 00:59:56.222]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.506 --> 00:59:59.727]  Big Brother.
[01:00:03.949 --> 01:00:13.859]  Make no mistake, we're in a war for liberty and freedom, not just for our children and their children, but for current freedom.
[01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:28.653]  This is authoritarian tyranny.
[01:00:29.214 --> 01:00:30.455]  It is despotism.
[01:00:31.115 --> 01:00:36.399]  These people are tyrants and Lord Monckton and many others are fighting them.
[01:00:37.019 --> 01:00:44.725]  I hope everyone will get my DVD, Endgame, that exposes their eugenics population reduction plan for world government.
[01:00:45.405 --> 01:00:51.129]  And of course, follow the Republic that shows how the Green Takeover is the plan to destroy our country.
[01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:53.070]  That's the heart of this new film.
[01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:58.234]  You can get free t-shirts and free DVDs until Christmas at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:03.338]  You can still order today and get these shipped out before Christmas in most areas of the United States.
[01:01:03.758 --> 01:01:06.560]  I also wanted to tell you the website for our guest.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:07.881]  Be sure and visit it.
[01:01:08.221 --> 01:01:13.586]  Incredible information, reports, videos, exposing the fraud of man-made climate change.
[01:01:13.926 --> 01:01:15.787]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:01:16.308 --> 01:01:18.109]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:29.359]  All right, in the three and a half minutes we have left, Lord Monckton, on this eve of the final day of this wicked summit, are we having victories?
[01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:30.500]  Do we have the initiative?
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.440]  Where do we stand?
[01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:32.661]  And then in closing,
[01:01:33.587 --> 01:01:37.269]  Were you able to wake up any of the UN zombies?
[01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:46.554]  Let's first of all get one thing clear, and that is that there is no scientific basis for anything that this conference is proposing to do.
[01:01:46.914 --> 01:01:49.115]  There is no global warming problem.
[01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:51.717]  There has been no global warming for 15 years.
[01:01:52.197 --> 01:01:54.458]  There has been global cooling for 9 years.
[01:01:54.478 --> 01:02:02.883]  It's now known from paper after paper in the scientific literature that the effect of CO2 on temperature is a tiny fraction of what the UN pretends it is.
[01:02:03.447 --> 01:02:05.228]  The science is now clear.
[01:02:05.548 --> 01:02:08.149]  The debate effectively in the scientific community is over.
[01:02:08.189 --> 01:02:09.409]  There isn't a problem.
[01:02:09.869 --> 01:02:13.610]  Of course, many of the scientists who've been making a fortune out of this don't want to admit it.
[01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:16.311]  But the science, on the science we have won.
[01:02:16.992 --> 01:02:18.932]  On the economics also we have won.
[01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:30.056]  Even if the UN were right about the science and the effect of warming that CO2 has, then it would still take 41 years of our current rate of emission
[01:02:30.461 --> 01:02:34.904]  Before we had even raised global temperature by a single Celsius degree.
[01:02:35.525 --> 01:02:52.957]  So, even if we were waiting another 10 years, and did absolutely nothing to see which way the temperatures go, and whether any of this really is real, that would be the cheapest and most responsible thing to do, because the worst that could happen, even if we did nothing for that time, is an extra quarter of a degree Celsius, which is totally harmless on any view.
[01:02:53.477 --> 01:03:00.062]  So we've won on the science, we've won on the economics, there is no truth or reality behind any of what they're saying.
[01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:06.055]  And yet, we are going to lose on the bureaucracy because they are going to set up a world government.
[01:03:06.455 --> 01:03:07.896]  How then do we deal with this?
[01:03:08.657 --> 01:03:17.543]  Well, I think what we've got to do is to make it clear that we are still going to regard ourselves as democratic countries, even if they try to take our democracy away.
[01:03:18.184 --> 01:03:22.367]  And we will not pay for this monstrous world government.
[01:03:22.927 --> 01:03:29.872]  And we will not vote for any US representatives who have any truck with this world government.
[01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:34.873]  We're going to have to say to our representatives, do you support this world government or don't you?
[01:03:35.114 --> 01:03:37.736]  Because if you don't, we will vote you out of office.
[01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:40.858]  Use your democracy while you still have it.
[01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:50.565]  Try to make sure that any US representative can go along, whether in the Senate or in the House, with the notion of a world government which you should pay for.
[01:03:51.186 --> 01:03:55.389]  Anyone who supports that on the basis of what we now know from Climategate
[01:03:56.176 --> 01:04:00.657]  And confirming my own researches show the whole thing is fraud as I said to Pachauri.
[01:04:00.677 --> 01:04:05.318]  I confronted him with the word fraud two days ago and he was very taken aback.
[01:04:05.338 --> 01:04:06.579]  He was visibly shaken.
[01:04:06.939 --> 01:04:10.700]  He himself has enormous financial vested interest in this.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:20.182]  He has continued to be chairman of the Tata Steel Industries Energy Research Institute, which is currently tendering among other things for an enormous UN contract.
[01:04:20.694 --> 01:04:21.655]  Absolutely!
[01:04:51.411 --> 01:04:52.112]  Absolutely.
[01:04:52.172 --> 01:04:55.694]  Lord Christopher Monckton, thank you so much for covering Copenhagen for us.
[01:04:56.014 --> 01:04:57.335]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:04:59.016 --> 01:05:02.679]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:06.061]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:11.045]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:11.065 --> 01:05:17.349]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:17.469 --> 01:05:19.711]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:20.531]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:20.551 --> 01:05:20.972]  Bernanke?
[01:05:21.052 --> 01:05:21.652]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:22.993]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:23.013 --> 01:05:25.255]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:40.989]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:46.116]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:46.416 --> 01:05:55.548]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:58.203 --> 01:06:00.825]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:06.188]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:06.548 --> 01:06:08.289]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:13.412]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:13.593 --> 01:06:14.553]  How much do you want?
[01:06:14.773 --> 01:06:15.534]  When do you want it?
[01:06:15.914 --> 01:06:17.515]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:17.795 --> 01:06:18.616]  When will you need it?
[01:06:18.856 --> 01:06:20.937]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.178]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:22.418 --> 01:06:23.719]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:29.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:32.381]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:32.762 --> 01:06:36.263]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:37.583]  How much will you need?
[01:06:37.823 --> 01:06:38.423]  We don't know.
[01:06:38.723 --> 01:06:39.623]  How much do you want?
[01:06:39.824 --> 01:06:40.564]  All you can get.
[01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:41.444]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:41.844 --> 01:06:44.606]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:44.887 --> 01:06:46.648]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:47.589]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:57.176 --> 01:07:04.039]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.400]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.121]  It's very real.
[01:07:06.261 --> 01:07:10.022]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:07:10.143 --> 01:07:14.465]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.986]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:07:17.186 --> 01:07:22.989]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.189]  Yes.
[01:07:23.209 --> 01:07:27.932]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:07:27.972 --> 01:07:30.733]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.455]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:33.535 --> 01:07:40.699]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:07:40.999 --> 01:07:46.922]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.203]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:49.784 --> 01:07:56.347]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:07:58.568 --> 01:08:04.091]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:15.720]  All right, we just had Mort Monton on for the entire first hour.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.902]  Or to be technical, for a full hour.
[01:08:22.922 --> 01:08:26.463]  He came on in the second segment, was with us in the first segment of this hour.
[01:08:27.083 --> 01:08:29.103]  Trying to train my brain to be exact.
[01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.304]  And so, uh, with us, uh,
[01:08:34.847 --> 01:08:38.512]  In the last hour, breaking down the state of the Copenhagen event.
[01:08:38.652 --> 01:08:43.378]  And absolutely, as I said days ago, that is completely staged on record.
[01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:51.369]  George Soros, Rockefeller, U.N., Maury Strong, funded fake hippies.
[01:08:52.995 --> 01:09:00.102]  So that the Nazi New World Order can look like it's just a harmless, you know, dreadlocked sandals.
[01:09:00.142 --> 01:09:02.944]  Hey man, save the Earth, dude!
[01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:05.667]  Kill first-born babies!
[01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.909]  Sterilize everybody!
[01:09:08.249 --> 01:09:10.551]  Cut off the food to Africa!
[01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:13.033]  It's liberal, oh yeah!
[01:09:14.114 --> 01:09:14.214]  And...
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.983]  They have them attack the police so that they can show the image, oh look, protesters are always bad.
[01:09:22.303 --> 01:09:30.126]  Don't ever be involved in a demonstration or you'll look like these people that have mange who are attacking police.
[01:09:31.909 --> 01:09:32.049]  Yes.
[01:09:52.665 --> 01:10:01.630]  The beatnik types that are over them, they'll walk right over at many events and just threaten me and go, of course we work for the globalists and we're taking over and I'm going to get your money!
[01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:10.775]  I mean, they are just criminals and they're into manipulating people and they're into the corruption and they're into working for the big bankers.
[01:10:11.736 --> 01:10:14.598]  I mean, it's just all a giant joke to them.
[01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:26.621]  If they can't get groups of them in place, they just have cops dress up like anarchists in Canada, in the U.S., in Italy, in Greece.
[01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:40.230]  I mean, this is all, in the last year and a half, every major western country has been caught with federal and local police dressing up like protesters and attacking police.
[01:10:41.266 --> 01:10:44.148]  And in most cases, they tell the group of cops they're going to attack.
[01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:45.548]  And then they stage it.
[01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:51.712]  But in some cases, they hit cops in the head with bottles, and they hit them on the head with rocks, and they punch them.
[01:10:52.792 --> 01:11:00.937]  And those are the cases we tend to find out, because the cops will then sometimes tackle them and arrest them, and the cops will start begging, going, it's me, it's me!
[01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.718]  You know, code, code 789, or whatever.
[01:11:03.738 --> 01:11:05.179]  I mean, this is on video.
[01:11:07.065 --> 01:11:07.526]  Canada.
[01:11:08.226 --> 01:11:16.396]  We found out in Denver, because they had Denver cops under federal control, part of the intelligence unit, go out and attack another group of riot cops.
[01:11:16.757 --> 01:11:20.081]  They got mad and beat up some of the cops that attacked them.
[01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:25.747]  And then it came out, because police started complaining to the Denver Post, I don't like being hit in the head with a rock!
[01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.208]  What are cops doing this for?
[01:11:28.749 --> 01:11:35.330]  See, they find weak-minded police and they have these drills, these training exercises to fight rioters.
[01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:42.451]  And they do this out on the back 40, you know, at the military base or at the police training center all over the country.
[01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.172]  And they'll do it on the back 40.
[01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:48.153]  And then they say, you know how we did that simulation?
[01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.853]  We're going to have some live training today.
[01:11:51.233 --> 01:11:54.714]  You're going to march over to those cops and you're going to hit them.
[01:11:57.136 --> 01:11:58.457]  And the cops don't ask questions.
[01:11:58.477 --> 01:12:00.218]  They don't say, well, do they know I'm coming?
[01:12:00.878 --> 01:12:01.598]  They just do it.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:08.022]  Police, you have to start thinking for yourselves.
[01:12:09.322 --> 01:12:10.603]  You have to start doing this.
[01:12:11.003 --> 01:12:12.704]  I mean, I remember in 1999 they had the Fortune 500 in Austin.
[01:12:15.427 --> 01:12:19.791]  And I knew a little bit about provocateurs, but I'm there in these giant anarchists.
[01:12:19.871 --> 01:12:38.406]  I mean, a real anarchist is like a meth head who's got a pension fund, weighs about 120 pounds, has pot marks all over their face, giant pentagram tattoos on their chest, and they're wearing Mao Zedong hats, saying they're an anarchist, when communism is supposedly the opposite of that.
[01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:45.533]  I mean, that's your low-level, well-meaning idiot who's being run by a federal informant.
[01:12:45.954 --> 01:12:48.795]  And I've always warned people about this, and it just came out.
[01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:57.240]  Big federal informants setting up anarchists locally and trying to get them to firebomb basically our organization that we're involved with, Brave New Books.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.901]  But luckily, that was exposed.
[01:13:00.362 --> 01:13:10.370]  There's all sorts of other connections to the firebombing of the governor's mansion and a murder of a Palestinian activist who was gutted and tortured to death.
[01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:14.193]  I mean, these people mean business that we're dealing with here.
[01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:18.056]  It's a bunch of Trotskyites basically running around.
[01:13:18.076 --> 01:13:21.518]  Because they're just revolutionaries.
[01:13:21.538 --> 01:13:22.399]  They're not fascists.
[01:13:22.419 --> 01:13:23.279]  They're not communists.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.621]  They're bank robbers.
[01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:27.623]  And they mean business.
[01:13:27.683 --> 01:13:28.964]  And they want to bring this country down.
[01:13:30.117 --> 01:13:32.338]  Because if you run government, you're the king.
[01:13:33.858 --> 01:13:35.619]  And that's who works for these big banks.
[01:13:37.019 --> 01:13:39.180]  And the military doesn't have a clue what's going on.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.642]  I mean, people better get the larger game plan down.
[01:13:43.682 --> 01:13:45.162]  You better figure out their tricks.
[01:13:45.482 --> 01:13:48.864]  Because once you know their playbook, it's like, why didn't I see this before?
[01:13:49.204 --> 01:13:50.924]  Why wasn't this completely obvious?
[01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:57.792]  We got guests coming up from Copenhagen with continual reporting.
[01:13:59.072 --> 01:14:06.454]  We've had mainline reporters on, alternative media, we've had members of the House of Lords on, we've had congressmen on about Copenhagen.
[01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:16.476]  We've got two new American JBS reporters coming on who are really passe now.
[01:14:18.897 --> 01:14:19.397]  Talk about
[01:14:21.479 --> 01:14:24.540]  Talk about passé, I'm becoming a bit passé.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:36.862]  You know, there was that shocking undergroundness of Alex Jones is talking about the New World Order, global banks using carbon taxes.
[01:14:37.022 --> 01:14:38.462]  Ten years ago I was warning people.
[01:14:39.262 --> 01:14:40.462]  Because we had UN documents.
[01:14:41.122 --> 01:14:45.363]  And wow, you can only get it from Alex Jones, or only get it from the New American.
[01:14:46.363 --> 01:14:49.364]  Now it's just, yeah, we're setting up a global government, what's wrong with that?
[01:14:50.532 --> 01:14:57.998]  So, the globalists are attempting to just throw it out there like it's no big deal, and act like global government's a good thing.
[01:14:58.258 --> 01:15:04.423]  This is a, even if you're for global government, this is dictatorial, unelected, and criminal, run by private interest.
[01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:06.604]  No one should be for this.
[01:15:06.684 --> 01:15:10.627]  But, they kind of get the hippies and leftists to be like, it's like Star Trek!
[01:15:11.148 --> 01:15:13.069]  You know, the Planetary Federation!
[01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.471]  We're gonna help everyone!
[01:15:16.192 --> 01:15:16.612]  Yeah.
[01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:20.235]  Cutting the food off to the third world, that's really gonna help people.
[01:15:23.157 --> 01:15:37.167]  And so just as a lot of conservatives woke up that Bush wasn't a good guy, liberals are going to have to wake up that their wing of the New World Order, it's a winged creature, bird of prey, chewing freedom's eyes out.
[01:15:39.088 --> 01:15:45.673]  You're going to have to wake up that you've been conned and that you've been defrauded and that you're supporting a Hitlerian eugenics agenda.
[01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:50.256]  So what I'm going to do is open the phones up.
[01:15:50.276 --> 01:15:53.740]  Specifically, did you see the Global Warming Special with Jesse Ventura last night?
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.121]  Groundbreaking!
[01:15:55.481 --> 01:16:02.788]  Talking about world government, new world order, population reduction, planetary taxes run by criminals like Maurice Strong.
[01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:09.094]  Showing the UN openly announcing they want a one world currency and to get rid of the US currency.
[01:16:11.576 --> 01:16:15.797]  I mean, this was better than the 9-11 special.
[01:16:15.937 --> 01:16:18.237]  Better than the HAARP special.
[01:16:18.277 --> 01:16:20.318]  I mean, those were entertaining, interesting, important.
[01:16:20.538 --> 01:16:21.998]  The 9-11 was groundbreaking.
[01:16:22.418 --> 01:16:29.320]  Getting into an inside job, and the FBI hiding the flight recorders and the data recorders that were found at Ground Zero.
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.720]  Extremely powerful.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.642]  But, I mean, this 9-11 special, this one-hour special, and I consulted on them all.
[01:16:37.582 --> 01:16:38.622]  I love all the episodes.
[01:16:39.798 --> 01:16:51.666]  But this one just completely blew me away because it start to finish exposed the entire fraud and Ventura admits that he once supported this and that he was conned.
[01:16:52.306 --> 01:16:57.490]  And remember Ventura was making this global warming special five months ago, six months ago when they started it.
[01:16:58.522 --> 01:17:01.904]  And so they just two weeks ago added the end of it about ClimateGate.
[01:17:02.204 --> 01:17:08.267]  It was already about fraudulent UN documents and faking data and all the other frauds they've been caught in.
[01:17:08.568 --> 01:17:10.989]  I mean, this was a home run.
[01:17:11.429 --> 01:17:13.190]  And I am so honored to be involved in it.
[01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.251]  I am so honored to be part of it.
[01:17:18.473 --> 01:17:19.734]  Again, I talked to the producer.
[01:17:19.814 --> 01:17:20.934]  He can't believe it's airing.
[01:17:20.954 --> 01:17:23.696]  I mean, genuinely, they can't believe this is all airing.
[01:17:25.097 --> 01:17:25.798]  They can't believe it.
[01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:28.680]  This is groundbreaking that this is happening.
[01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:33.344]  And of course it's getting top ratings on... Top ratings for the channel.
[01:17:33.624 --> 01:17:35.225]  Top ratings for a new series.
[01:17:35.926 --> 01:17:41.490]  They almost never have the same ratings on the shows after the first show.
[01:17:43.752 --> 01:17:47.375]  This thing's getting the same ratings or higher in the second and third shows.
[01:17:48.275 --> 01:17:49.897]  So... Home run.
[01:17:50.497 --> 01:17:51.458]  Ultra exciting.
[01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:52.499]  Ultra...
[01:17:54.972 --> 01:18:05.657]  Buoying, enlightening, just showing that we can take the system over as Ron Paul has talked about doing, as Geo McGriffin has talked about doing.
[01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:10.700]  We can act like leaders, act like winners, because we are winners.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.460]  We are leaders.
[01:18:12.061 --> 01:18:13.801]  And we have to start having confidence.
[01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.283]  So many people out there don't have confidence.
[01:18:16.483 --> 01:18:20.185]  When you've got the truth on your side, it doesn't matter if you're outnumbered 10 to 1 at first.
[01:18:20.705 --> 01:18:22.586]  You stand up, like Mark Twain said,
[01:18:23.675 --> 01:18:26.939]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[01:18:27.099 --> 01:18:31.645]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:18:32.826 --> 01:18:34.668]  Now, we haven't reached that point yet.
[01:18:36.851 --> 01:18:40.676]  Our cause hasn't fully succeeded, but it's beginning to succeed.
[01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:43.179]  And nothing succeeds like success.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.841]  I mean, that's just the way it works.
[01:18:49.441 --> 01:18:52.782]  And the globalists get this attitude of invincibility and fallibility.
[01:18:53.023 --> 01:18:55.584]  You know, the private fellow reserve, you can't question them.
[01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:56.584]  They're God.
[01:18:56.604 --> 01:18:58.165]  They know best.
[01:18:58.905 --> 01:19:00.526]  They've got all the answers.
[01:19:00.826 --> 01:19:01.946]  You know, they're the experts.
[01:19:01.966 --> 01:19:03.247]  Nobody can stop them.
[01:19:03.707 --> 01:19:05.387]  You know, there's nothing you can do.
[01:19:05.447 --> 01:19:06.908]  Just get with the program.
[01:19:07.188 --> 01:19:08.829]  You better just join with them.
[01:19:09.289 --> 01:19:13.311]  You better just join with Sauron because there's nothing you can do.
[01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:15.032]  You better just give in to it.
[01:19:15.192 --> 01:19:16.313]  It's all over.
[01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:18.434]  You better just go along.
[01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.015]  That aura is now gone.
[01:19:23.056 --> 01:19:26.318]  And people are going, this is a little pot-bellied goblin behind the curtain.
[01:19:28.151 --> 01:19:29.091]  You're not invincible.
[01:19:29.552 --> 01:19:34.134]  People are pulling out their daggers in the Info War and just shanking.
[01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:39.577]  People are going, wow, it's bleeding, yeah!
[01:19:41.097 --> 01:19:43.699]  Man, look at those gouts of blood coming out of the New World Order.
[01:19:44.039 --> 01:19:45.780]  Here, go ahead and give me a machete.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.661]  I mean, it's, you know, oh, look at that leg.
[01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:53.683]  And it's now groveling and spewing and threatening.
[01:19:54.003 --> 01:19:56.165]  But believe me, we can rout these people.
[01:19:56.245 --> 01:19:56.705]  Stay with me.
[01:19:58.783 --> 01:20:00.204]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:20:00.785 --> 01:20:03.447]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:20:04.027 --> 01:20:07.570]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:20:08.473 --> 01:20:17.378]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[01:20:17.698 --> 01:20:19.579]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[01:20:19.919 --> 01:20:25.342]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:20:25.622 --> 01:20:30.385]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:20:31.045 --> 01:20:35.746]  It works so well, saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[01:20:35.766 --> 01:20:38.847]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[01:20:59.352 --> 01:21:02.999]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:03.379 --> 01:21:06.365]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:08.028]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:08.746 --> 01:21:11.389]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:17.614]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:17.815 --> 01:21:22.839]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:32.989]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:35.211]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:35.451 --> 01:21:36.773]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:37.033 --> 01:21:39.295]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:41.337]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:41.618 --> 01:21:46.422]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:21:57.774 --> 01:21:58.235]  Gold.
[01:21:58.535 --> 01:21:59.857]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:22:00.097 --> 01:22:06.206]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:10.211]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:10.572 --> 01:22:12.454]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:12.515 --> 01:22:12.695]  Mint,
[01:22:13.035 --> 01:22:14.776]  Demand is at an all-time high.

[01:22:39.005 --> 01:22:40.046]  We're good.
[01:22:57.242 --> 01:23:00.424]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:00.804 --> 01:23:02.645]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:03.085 --> 01:23:03.505]  Don't!
[01:23:03.965 --> 01:23:06.987]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:07.387 --> 01:23:14.531]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:16.171]  's number one debt secret.
[01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:20.193]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:23:20.574 --> 01:23:23.255]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:23:23.695 --> 01:23:30.723]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:23:31.063 --> 01:23:32.064]  Herb K was right.
[01:23:32.244 --> 01:23:35.328]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:23:35.448 --> 01:23:36.449]  What have you got to lose?
[01:23:36.789 --> 01:23:39.933]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:41.213]  Get Herb K.'

[01:23:44.434 --> 01:23:44.974]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:23:44.994 --> 01:23:45.214]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:23:45.234 --> 01:23:45.274]  888-352-7726.
[01:23:45.294 --> 01:23:46.734]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:23:47.034 --> 01:23:49.615]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.264 --> 01:24:12.206]  All right, I got piles of news on the economy, on the police state, on war, on Copenhagen.
[01:24:14.587 --> 01:24:17.228]  We're not winning the war, but we're having some victories.
[01:24:17.988 --> 01:24:18.929]  And we're gaining ground.
[01:24:19.069 --> 01:24:19.989]  We're not losing ground.
[01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:22.650]  We're coming back from behind.
[01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:29.073]  I want to give the toll-free number out if you saw the Ventura program on global warming fraud last night.
[01:24:30.973 --> 01:24:34.995]  If you want to talk about anything that Lord Moncton discussed, government-run health care,
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.942]  May not pass the Senate this year.
[01:24:40.783 --> 01:24:45.506]  Even if it does, Pelosi, now they do play possum, but I've looked at it.
[01:24:47.487 --> 01:24:51.190]  It looks like she's not just playing possum to get people to stand down.
[01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.931]  That's part of it.
[01:24:53.492 --> 01:24:59.176]  She also doesn't want it to look like a defeat if the House isn't able to pass this this year.
[01:25:00.532 --> 01:25:05.273]  And every day that passes, I'd say 80% chance this bill won't pass this year.
[01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:08.754]  And by next week, it's a 90% chance.
[01:25:08.874 --> 01:25:18.736]  And then if we get into next year, more time to expose what's in that bill, there is a 50-50 chance it'll pass.
[01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:24.917]  Because then they'll have more time, but then we can run the clock up on them again.
[01:25:25.597 --> 01:25:28.958]  So we are at that crossroads right now.
[01:25:30.393 --> 01:25:34.674]  And you need to go to your congressman's meeting, your senator's meeting.
[01:25:34.914 --> 01:25:39.895]  You need to go to their office, their local office, and tell them you're going to be campaigning against them and exposing them.
[01:25:41.015 --> 01:25:46.116]  You need to physically call them, physically visit them.
[01:25:47.357 --> 01:25:49.057]  And the fight is going to be in the House.
[01:25:49.237 --> 01:25:54.438]  The fight's in the Senate, but the real fight's in the House with those committees.
[01:25:55.198 --> 01:25:57.899]  They're going to have to go back and forth with the Senate and the House version.
[01:25:58.595 --> 01:26:02.678]  They're probably going to get it this year or early next year in the Senate.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.841]  But it's going to be two different bills.
[01:26:06.702 --> 01:26:07.743]  And boy is it bad.
[01:26:09.924 --> 01:26:12.607]  Five years in prison, quarter million dollar fines.
[01:26:12.687 --> 01:26:15.189]  I mean, it's hard to believe this is really in there.
[01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.850]  But it is.
[01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:19.412]  Cutting Medicare and Medicaid.
[01:26:19.853 --> 01:26:23.215]  It raises your taxes, but then cuts the benefits.
[01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:24.857]  Because it all goes to the bankers.
[01:26:26.616 --> 01:26:39.785]  We've got to get the message out to well-meaning, moron, collectivist, who really think there's such a thing as a free lunch, that, hey, Dennis Kucinich, one of the only real socialists in Congress, he's a real collectivist.
[01:26:39.825 --> 01:26:43.468]  He says this is a boondoggle for the big banks and insurance companies.
[01:26:45.409 --> 01:26:46.470]  Again, read his editorial.
[01:26:48.171 --> 01:26:49.672]  Why I Voted Against Healthcare Bill.
[01:26:50.753 --> 01:26:53.374]  And he goes on to say, in another headline article,
[01:26:54.372 --> 01:26:56.994]  This is a bailout for insurance companies.
[01:26:57.434 --> 01:26:58.355]  They wrote it!
[01:26:58.855 --> 01:27:03.038]  Then they tell you that they're against it.
[01:27:03.558 --> 01:27:05.960]  That's the slick propaganda of these people.
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:07.861]  They use psychology.
[01:27:09.622 --> 01:27:19.669]  And so, you gotta reach out to constituents of people like Lloyd Doggett, here in Texas, and others, and just say, look,
[01:27:21.935 --> 01:27:27.958]  I am going to go and vote against you with whoever has a chance to beat you, and then if they're bad, we'll vote them out.
[01:27:28.238 --> 01:27:32.660]  But we're going to get rid of you politically if you do this.
[01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:39.122]  So, we need to keep pressure on the Senate because they're losing momentum.
[01:27:39.343 --> 01:27:40.483]  They've almost got it.
[01:27:40.523 --> 01:27:41.644]  They've almost got it.
[01:27:42.284 --> 01:27:48.987]  The government getting more control over our lives and being able to dole out healthcare to us.
[01:27:50.051 --> 01:27:55.834]  Back when there was no government involved in healthcare, 30-40 years ago, we had much better healthcare, much lower.
[01:27:56.174 --> 01:28:00.276]  The more money government pours into healthcare, the more the price goes up.
[01:28:00.837 --> 01:28:02.738]  Because they're destroying competition.
[01:28:03.698 --> 01:28:08.981]  Also, you know, we've got 30 million illegal aliens in this country who get free healthcare.
[01:28:09.821 --> 01:28:11.142]  We're all fitting the bill for that.
[01:28:12.691 --> 01:28:18.834]  I mean, I don't personally dislike the illegal aliens, but they're bankrupting the country, which is what the banks want.
[01:28:18.894 --> 01:28:19.955]  They want us dependent.
[01:28:20.175 --> 01:28:21.836]  They want the state governments bankrupt.
[01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:24.497]  So they can come in with even more government as the solution.
[01:28:25.137 --> 01:28:27.479]  See, if the globalists are for war, I'm against it.
[01:28:27.779 --> 01:28:29.860]  If the globalists are for open borders, I'm against it.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.182]  If the globalists are for giving themselves more power, I'm against it.
[01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:36.183]  If the globalists... Everything they do is criminal.
[01:28:36.843 --> 01:28:37.564]  It's very simple.
[01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:40.806]  But you've got to find out what they're actually against.
[01:28:41.306 --> 01:28:45.567]  See, they know a lot of you figured out that whatever the establishment's for, you're against.
[01:28:46.307 --> 01:28:50.388]  So they come out and say, Oh, big oil doesn't want the global carbon tax.
[01:28:50.828 --> 01:28:51.848]  They wrote the plan.
[01:28:53.949 --> 01:28:56.249]  Oh, insurance companies don't want this reform.
[01:28:56.649 --> 01:28:57.809]  They wrote the plan.
[01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.910]  On record.
[01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:05.971]  So see, you've got to find out what the elite is really for and then oppose it.
[01:29:08.413 --> 01:29:10.135]  And they want this Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:29:10.415 --> 01:29:13.457]  They want this global government, this private global corporate government.
[01:29:13.698 --> 01:29:15.119]  And that's why we've got to be against it.
[01:29:17.061 --> 01:29:26.209]  They want to use hundreds of millions of third world people to come in here as a weapon to take over our voting system and vote for gun control and vote for more tyranny?
[01:29:27.563 --> 01:29:38.246]  I'm sorry, I read the voting records of these immigrants, and they are ignorant people from lands of tyranny, and they vote exactly as the local socialist pimp tells them.
[01:29:39.687 --> 01:29:43.748]  And we better shut down the border and deport these illegals, or we're dead!
[01:29:44.588 --> 01:29:45.269]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:49.550]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.651]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:55.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.583 --> 01:30:02.768]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:02.888 --> 01:30:07.292]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:07.432 --> 01:30:09.274]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:09.694 --> 01:30:11.056]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:11.316 --> 01:30:12.357]  There is a solution.
[01:30:12.597 --> 01:30:20.602]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:30:21.002 --> 01:30:28.086]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:30:57.435 --> 01:31:01.678]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:01.998 --> 01:31:06.061]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:06.321 --> 01:31:11.744]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:12.084 --> 01:31:12.545]  It's true.
[01:31:12.825 --> 01:31:17.368]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:17.688 --> 01:31:18.228]  Number 3.
[01:31:18.509 --> 01:31:21.811]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:22.091 --> 01:31:25.834]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:26.574]  Number 4.
[01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:29.196]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:29.576 --> 01:31:32.978]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:33.259 --> 01:31:33.459]  Number 5.
[01:31:34.039 --> 01:31:37.962]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:38.183 --> 01:31:42.947]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:43.227 --> 01:31:47.270]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:47.411 --> 01:31:48.972]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:57.932 --> 01:32:00.534]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:00.934 --> 01:32:05.898]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:06.259 --> 01:32:08.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:13.124]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:13.324 --> 01:32:14.285]  How much do you want?
[01:32:14.505 --> 01:32:15.246]  When do you want it?
[01:32:15.626 --> 01:32:17.228]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:17.508 --> 01:32:18.328]  When will you need it?
[01:32:18.589 --> 01:32:20.650]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:21.891]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:22.131 --> 01:32:23.473]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:23.653 --> 01:32:24.013]  If there's a
[01:32:24.053 --> 01:32:26.014]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:28.716]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:28.896 --> 01:32:32.099]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:32.479 --> 01:32:35.981]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.302]  How much will you need?
[01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:38.143]  We don't know.
[01:32:38.443 --> 01:32:39.364]  How much do you want?
[01:32:39.544 --> 01:32:40.284]  All you can get.
[01:32:40.484 --> 01:32:41.285]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:41.545 --> 01:32:44.326]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:44.606 --> 01:32:46.807]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:46.847 --> 01:32:47.808]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:01.696 --> 01:33:08.545]  Jesse Ventura and his team are hot on the trail of a conspiracy to use the issue of global warming to control your life.
[01:33:09.426 --> 01:33:12.650]  The investigation has led to a mysterious shadowy figure.
[01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:19.279]  Maurice Strong is the world's leading environmentalist, who just happens to be a billionaire industrialist.
[01:33:21.477 --> 01:33:25.380]  Jesse's researchers set out to track down Maurice Strong in China.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:30.884]  Well, if we can't talk to this Maurice Strong, then who the hell can we talk to?
[01:33:31.765 --> 01:33:35.747]  While June Sarpong has gotten a step closer to his inner circle... It's me.
[01:33:36.288 --> 01:33:36.748]  I got him.
[01:33:37.489 --> 01:33:38.429]  Ben Santa.
[01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:41.011]  Maurice Strong's Ben Santa.
[01:33:41.632 --> 01:33:41.832]  Yep.
[01:33:42.232 --> 01:33:45.535]  He's the climate researcher they're saying doctored the UN report.
[01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:52.254]  Apparently, they say he removed everything against global warming and set the cards for Marie Strong.
[01:33:52.815 --> 01:34:00.821]  June finds Ben Santer working in the highest corridors of power at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Northern California.
[01:34:01.582 --> 01:34:04.224]  Why do you think there are so many doubters still?
[01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:07.809]  I don't think there are so many doubters still.
[01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:13.294]  You will always be able to go out and find someone who disagrees with conventional wisdom.
[01:34:13.534 --> 01:34:14.875]  June gets to the point.
[01:34:15.336 --> 01:34:19.640]  Did he cook the books on global warming, as Christopher Monckton claims?
[01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:24.244]  There is no proven link between human activity and increases in global temperature.
[01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:27.087]  Five times, in different words, they said the same thing very plain.
[01:34:27.147 --> 01:34:31.131]  Santa went through, crossed out all of those, and substituted a new conclusion.
[01:34:32.793 --> 01:34:37.297]  Well, Lord Monckton, to my knowledge, was not part of the process.
[01:34:39.019 --> 01:34:39.359]  I was.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:50.951]  Our chapter came to the conclusion, a line that's burned on my memory forever, the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.
[01:34:52.762 --> 01:34:55.204]  But did he delete sections of the climate report?
[01:34:55.844 --> 01:35:00.847]  Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter, and there were deletions from the chapter.
[01:35:01.468 --> 01:35:05.390]  To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.
[01:35:05.871 --> 01:35:09.453]  Why do you think there were so many conspiracy theorists around this issue?
[01:35:09.513 --> 01:35:11.975]  People love believing a good conspiracy theory.
[01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:15.573]  There's another reason conspiracy theories come up.
[01:35:16.013 --> 01:35:18.976]  Because people leave lots of room for doubt.
[01:35:19.857 --> 01:35:23.601]  Santor doesn't deny deleting information from the UN report.
[01:35:24.422 --> 01:35:26.944]  He just says he's misunderstood.
[01:35:27.485 --> 01:35:30.488]  And that leaves a lot of questions about Maurice Strong.
[01:35:31.108 --> 01:35:32.570]  It's time to get the answers.
[01:35:36.747 --> 01:35:41.431]  Jesse Ventura sets off alone for a meeting with the man he calls his wild card.
[01:35:44.214 --> 01:35:47.537]  Alex Jones inhabits the conspiracy world as few others.
[01:35:48.118 --> 01:35:49.979]  He's an expert of world renown.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.661]  He knows the players.
[01:35:52.201 --> 01:35:56.425]  He knows the connections, the whistleblowers, and the operatives.
[01:35:57.086 --> 01:35:59.468]  Most important, he knows the history.
[01:35:59.768 --> 01:36:01.049]  Alex, good to see you again.
[01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:02.130]  Thanks for meeting me here.
[01:36:02.371 --> 01:36:03.351]  Governor, good to see you.
[01:36:03.612 --> 01:36:05.493]  I believe I may have the information you're looking for.
[01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:05.794]  Good.
[01:36:06.254 --> 01:36:08.116]  Alex, how do we get to Maurice Strong?
[01:36:08.676 --> 01:36:09.857]  He's very hard to get to.
[01:36:10.298 --> 01:36:12.319]  He rarely does interviews.
[01:36:12.359 --> 01:36:13.901]  He jet sets all over the planet.
[01:36:14.281 --> 01:36:15.422]  He's a man without a country.
[01:36:15.963 --> 01:36:17.824]  He's a major front man for the United Nations.
[01:36:17.864 --> 01:36:18.765]  He's been a high-level U.N.
[01:36:18.805 --> 01:36:19.165]  official.
[01:36:19.205 --> 01:36:21.628]  He also works closely with the Rockefeller family.
[01:36:22.268 --> 01:36:26.112]  And he is the person behind the call for all these different global taxes.
[01:36:26.592 --> 01:36:32.798]  The way you get to him is with somebody who 25 years ago worked very close with him, and that's George Hunt.
[01:36:32.878 --> 01:36:33.479]  George Hunt.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:34.420]  Okay.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:36.502]  He is the consummate insider.
[01:36:36.542 --> 01:36:39.945]  He was there at the beginning, at the embryonic formation.
[01:36:40.966 --> 01:36:47.392]  of this phony environmental movement that intends to take over the entire planet's resources and set up a form of tyranny.
[01:36:47.812 --> 01:36:50.534]  So you're telling me that George Hunt is the key?
[01:36:50.594 --> 01:36:54.638]  He can put the jigsaw puzzle together on this whole global warming thing?
[01:36:55.398 --> 01:36:57.040]  He's our man on the inside.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.462]  And you can set up this meeting with George Hunt?
[01:36:59.902 --> 01:37:05.707]  Jesse, I will have George Hunt here for you, in this warehouse, same time, same place tomorrow.
[01:37:06.167 --> 01:37:06.848]  You can meet with him.
[01:37:07.208 --> 01:37:16.510]  He can explain the entire agenda, the move towards world government, the takeover of resources by megacorporations and the shadowy families that control them.
[01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:18.410]  All of it ties together.
[01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:22.471]  These are the people that are behind the European Union and the Euro.
[01:37:22.651 --> 01:37:23.571]  I'll meet with him, Alex.
[01:37:23.711 --> 01:37:24.431]  Thanks for doing it.
[01:37:24.652 --> 01:37:25.012]  Thank you.
[01:37:25.032 --> 01:37:25.252]  Thank you.
[01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:26.112]  And I'll be here tomorrow.
[01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:26.392]  You bet.
[01:37:27.232 --> 01:37:31.673]  George Hunt had better be here, and he'd better have the goods.
[01:37:36.559 --> 01:37:39.181]  Coming up, he shows up all right.
[01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:45.345]  The man who makes a direct link between the global warming scare and a plot to rule the world.
[01:37:46.285 --> 01:37:54.190]  Their aims are to create an anxiety about the ecology and global warming and so on.
[01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:56.652]  They're going to use it to take over the world.
[01:37:58.467 --> 01:38:02.708]  And then, Maury Strong can run to China, but can he hide?
[01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:06.670]  Jesse Ventura's investigation arrives in Beijing.
[01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:08.870]  Follow the money.
[01:38:15.752 --> 01:38:20.314]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:22.671]  Don't send your kin, folks!
[01:38:22.711 --> 01:38:23.271]  I'll be gone.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:42.043]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[01:38:42.063 --> 01:38:46.266]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:38:46.946 --> 01:38:53.150]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin', cussin', moan.
[01:38:53.230 --> 01:38:58.453]  Understand, you old man, I'm tired of your bad mouthing.
[01:38:58.513 --> 01:39:00.535]  Understand, you old man.
[01:39:03.211 --> 01:39:04.412]  Good old Johnny Cash.
[01:39:04.492 --> 01:39:09.256]  I'm telling you folks, TruTV is going to be re-airing the full episode quite a bit in the next week.
[01:39:09.717 --> 01:39:12.760]  The next one premieres Wednesday, 10 p.m.
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:13.680]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.161]  Central.
[01:39:14.901 --> 01:39:17.504]  And we're all just marveling that they're putting this on air.
[01:39:19.795 --> 01:39:24.617]  I mean, Jesse really sets out to find out the truth and finds out HAARP is manipulating the weather.
[01:39:24.997 --> 01:39:29.660]  Finds out and confirms that the evidence shows 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:35.883]  Finds out that Maury Strong and the UN are running a global scam to steal all our money and control our lives.
[01:39:38.564 --> 01:39:46.888]  Next week, they expose RFID, face scanning cameras, Katherine Albrecht, and others are in the episode.
[01:39:49.458 --> 01:39:54.182]  And, you know, I was only one of five, six, seven consultants.
[01:39:55.543 --> 01:39:57.084]  But they really did their research.
[01:39:57.204 --> 01:39:59.866]  And they would set out to say, we're going to see if this is true.
[01:40:01.027 --> 01:40:03.469]  And they always basically find out it is.
[01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:08.413]  I mean, this is a real production with real investigation.
[01:40:10.374 --> 01:40:11.435]  And Ventura's for real.
[01:40:11.475 --> 01:40:12.536]  I mean, I know him personally.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.801]  And I just can't believe this is on air.
[01:40:20.902 --> 01:40:42.226]  But again, the globalists, and Jesse said this on air, the globalists have made the decision, they haven't told us this, we can see it, to just have Lord Rothschild come out, or David de Rothschild come out, or David Rockefeller come out, or Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, or Herman Van Rompuy come out, head of the EU, and say, we're setting up global government.
[01:40:45.549 --> 01:40:59.358]  And so, really, I guess the people at Time Warner and places, they can't just deny that we've been telling the truth the whole time, so they're like, okay, we'll make it an entertainment show, we'll call it Conspiracy Theory, and we'll just throw it out there, and the public's so conditioned.
[01:40:59.999 --> 01:41:01.720]  I guess this is revelation of the method.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:08.124]  It's kind of like Fox Television, six months before 9-11, a year before 9-11 produced it.
[01:41:08.544 --> 01:41:11.486]  Because I've talked to the star of the show, Dean Hagelin.
[01:41:11.747 --> 01:41:14.688]  I mean, he showed up at my house to tell me about this.
[01:41:15.729 --> 01:41:17.371]  Talk about living a conspiracy theory.
[01:41:18.132 --> 01:41:32.732]  The host of one of the stars of X-Files, and then of course the spinoff Lone Gunman, the main star of that show, the CIA approached Chris Carter and others and said, we want you to put this in your production.
[01:41:34.161 --> 01:41:43.185]  The government hijacks a jumbo jet to fly it into the World Trade Center to get martial law and blame it on Afghanistan to launch a new war.
[01:41:44.206 --> 01:41:54.611]  And the government uses a drill of hijacked jets to make NORAD stand down so that, because the rest of the government's not bad, they don't know, so they'll stand down and let it happen.
[01:41:55.491 --> 01:41:59.473]  And then six months after it airs, the exact same thing happens.
[01:42:00.894 --> 01:42:03.355]  So really, I think that's why this is allowed to air.
[01:42:08.735 --> 01:42:10.276]  And we're really being prepared.
[01:42:11.778 --> 01:42:14.660]  You know, I watch some popular culture, I scan it, I look at it.
[01:42:16.181 --> 01:42:19.504]  I've seen parts of Operation Blue Beam that have been declassified.
[01:42:19.524 --> 01:42:31.895]  And whether aliens are real or not, the United Nations, another big Rothschild, the federal government, all these astronauts coming out, moonwalkers talking about flying saucers.
[01:42:33.223 --> 01:42:37.186]  They are getting people ready for extraterrestrial life to be announced.
[01:42:37.626 --> 01:42:41.989]  And I don't know if it's this month or five years from now, but they're getting ready with that too.
[01:42:42.449 --> 01:42:44.290]  I just think they're just going to throw it all in our face.
[01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:53.696]  It's kind of like that Fox News piece yesterday where they go, yeah, the Japanese government's looking at putting lithium in the water and it might be a good idea to drug everybody.
[01:42:53.736 --> 01:42:55.057]  We put fluoride in the water.
[01:42:55.838 --> 01:42:57.078]  We medicate you that way.
[01:42:57.098 --> 01:42:59.760]  You know, we put iodine in salt.
[01:43:01.121 --> 01:43:02.482]  Why not put a metal?
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:12.464]  A light metal, but it has the same effects as a heavy metal and brain damages you and causes obesity and low sexual drive.
[01:43:16.085 --> 01:43:18.747]  And they go, well, we just need to maybe put that in your water.
[01:43:19.907 --> 01:43:22.609]  I mean, we know there's spike in the water in the food with this.
[01:43:22.649 --> 01:43:23.349]  They've been caught.
[01:43:25.461 --> 01:43:30.546]  More than half the corn syrup products you eat at stores that your kids eat has mercury added.
[01:43:30.987 --> 01:43:33.049]  It's not involved in the manufacturing processes.
[01:43:35.251 --> 01:43:37.734]  Again, we're just trained to just sit here and take it.
[01:43:38.715 --> 01:43:41.057]  Oh man, I'm not crazy like that Alex Jones.
[01:43:41.517 --> 01:43:46.603]  He gets mad that the UN says they're going to shut off our resources to destroy our society.
[01:43:48.334 --> 01:43:52.257]  I'm not worried about my society being destroyed and being turned into a third world slave.
[01:43:52.618 --> 01:43:53.558]  That's no big deal.
[01:43:54.179 --> 01:44:06.509]  Man, that guy's... Oh, that Alex Jones has read all these government textbooks and documents, like eco-science, where they admit they want to and are spiking the water with sterilants and chemicals that brain damage us.
[01:44:06.809 --> 01:44:09.652]  Man, that Alex Jones, he gets mad at being brain damaged.
[01:44:09.972 --> 01:44:12.814]  He's some... I mean, folks, I am normal.
[01:44:13.215 --> 01:44:14.356]  You are weird.
[01:44:14.876 --> 01:44:18.698]  If you're a new listener and you think I'm weird, you got the problem!
[01:44:18.999 --> 01:44:19.719]  You got me?
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:39.731]  If I ran up to a cop at a Burger King and he comes out of the bathroom and he catches me with a packet putting something in his drink and he comes over and grabs me and they arrest me and they test what's in the packet and it's lithium, a toxic metal
[01:44:41.929 --> 01:44:47.411]  Am I going to go to prison for attempted murder because it could kill you if it was enough of a dose?
[01:44:48.892 --> 01:44:52.393]  Would I at least get a poisoning charge?
[01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:54.774]  I'd probably spend 10, 15, 20 years in prison.
[01:44:55.394 --> 01:45:01.016]  The government admittedly is poisoning your water supply with over 150 chemicals they add.
[01:45:01.056 --> 01:45:01.416]  They add.
[01:45:07.188 --> 01:45:08.448]  And we just sit here and take it.
[01:45:08.648 --> 01:45:09.728]  You know why you take it?
[01:45:09.928 --> 01:45:11.689]  Because you're on lithium, folks.
[01:45:11.949 --> 01:45:14.209]  You're on sodium fluoride that has the same effect.
[01:45:14.869 --> 01:45:16.790]  You're on mercury that has the same effect.
[01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:19.650]  Do you understand?
[01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:23.251]  You have been brain damaged.
[01:45:23.571 --> 01:45:26.591]  That's why all the neurological disorders are off the charts.
[01:45:27.031 --> 01:45:28.732]  Most of them are up 200, 300, 400, 500.
[01:45:29.632 --> 01:45:31.352]  Some are up 10,000%.
[01:45:33.612 --> 01:45:35.793]  Now they're telling you, oh, you can get Alzheimer's when you're 25.
[01:45:37.813 --> 01:45:40.955]  They scan the brains, they're full of lithium and aluminum.
[01:45:43.657 --> 01:45:46.639]  I don't like having the opposite of a brain boost.
[01:45:47.219 --> 01:45:48.821]  I don't like people poisoning me.
[01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:52.383]  Now, then I'm going to your calls.
[01:45:52.643 --> 01:45:53.924]  It's another example of this.
[01:45:56.286 --> 01:46:02.450]  If I came to your door and said, I'd like to put cameras in your house to watch everything you do.
[01:46:04.144 --> 01:46:06.045]  You'd say, get off my porch, you nut!
[01:46:06.145 --> 01:46:07.185]  You'd slam the door on me.
[01:46:07.465 --> 01:46:09.126]  And if I didn't leave, you'd call the police on me.
[01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:10.367]  Or go get a shotgun.
[01:46:11.807 --> 01:46:18.750]  Google comes out four years ago and says, we've got a patent, and we're testing it now, and we're using it on people.
[01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:21.491]  Computers have built-in cameras and microphones.
[01:46:21.851 --> 01:46:23.912]  We're listening to everything you do in your home.
[01:46:24.152 --> 01:46:29.574]  If a dog barks, we then sell your name to distributors to send you dog food ads in the mail.
[01:46:29.854 --> 01:46:32.415]  We pop up dog food ads and dog toy ads.
[01:46:32.595 --> 01:46:33.476]  This was their example.
[01:46:34.316 --> 01:46:36.156]  And we know what sitcoms you're watching.
[01:46:36.296 --> 01:46:38.377]  But they said, don't worry, a human isn't listening.
[01:46:38.697 --> 01:46:42.598]  A computer creates a text file about all the noises in your house.
[01:46:43.938 --> 01:46:47.439]  And then we build a psychological algorithm.
[01:46:47.779 --> 01:46:52.000]  You got the cameras and the microphones in your house, watching and listening to you.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:56.160]  It's like I told people in 1996, 12 years ago, 13 years ago.
[01:46:56.721 --> 01:46:57.761]  Like, where is my cell phone?
[01:46:58.241 --> 01:46:58.861]  Thought I had that.
[01:47:00.230 --> 01:47:01.191]  Somebody bring me a cell phone.
[01:47:01.391 --> 01:47:02.251]  I just want to show people.
[01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:13.197]  I mean, it's on record that the government designed them by law, where the manufacturers make them, where even when the phone's off, they can dial in and listen to you and track your location.
[01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:14.658]  And I'd be called a kook.
[01:47:14.978 --> 01:47:15.839]  I'd be called a nut.
[01:47:16.159 --> 01:47:17.140]  I'd be called an idiot.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:21.322]  When I had the documents, now it's all over the news, but they tell you how good it is.
[01:47:21.742 --> 01:47:29.227]  You're having it introduced to you that you're a slave and you're property of the system, and that this is just the way it is.
[01:47:30.339 --> 01:47:32.461]  Yeah, we got face scanning cameras tracking you everywhere.
[01:47:32.661 --> 01:47:34.543]  Yeah, we got license plate readers tracking you.
[01:47:35.464 --> 01:47:39.608]  I'd tell people that 14 years ago and get laughed at.
[01:47:40.649 --> 01:47:48.457]  You better stop laughing if you think it's funny that the entire society is being geared
[01:47:49.824 --> 01:47:53.686]  To surveil and control and track you and know who you really are.
[01:47:54.126 --> 01:48:00.229]  You think trying to get a job as a cop or something and they give you some 600-question psychological meant to catch you in lies?
[01:48:00.809 --> 01:48:02.330]  You think that's a detailed psychological?
[01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:09.634]  How about the millions of choices you make a year playing Xbox and PlayStation Interactive tied into those big computer hubs?
[01:48:10.725 --> 01:48:13.466]  I would tell people, because I was told this by a Time Warner technician,
[01:48:29.738 --> 01:48:30.379]  We're good to go.
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.521]  I had Time Warner during those casts would just cut my show off.
[01:48:56.861 --> 01:49:04.984]  And then I talked to people at Playback who were there when they would get calls at Playback Control saying, turn that live show off.
[01:49:05.304 --> 01:49:13.546]  See, they didn't want you to know in 1997 or 98, man, time flies, that everything was being watched and tracked.
[01:49:13.786 --> 01:49:15.027]  Now they just go, yeah, mm-hmm.
[01:49:15.667 --> 01:49:16.907]  Oh, yeah, everything.
[01:49:17.527 --> 01:49:19.508]  See, folks, it's total control.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:27.183]  So see, that's why they don't care if Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura go on television and tell you something.
[01:49:27.363 --> 01:49:28.663]  Because they think you're chumps.
[01:49:28.703 --> 01:49:29.683]  They think you're a joke.
[01:49:29.884 --> 01:49:30.884]  They think you're idiots.
[01:49:31.624 --> 01:49:34.285]  They know it's known that they're putting stuff in the water.
[01:49:36.526 --> 01:49:37.727]  Because you're drugged.
[01:49:38.207 --> 01:49:41.948]  And the evidence is they're now increasing the amount of drugs they're putting in the water.
[01:49:42.828 --> 01:49:45.650]  They're doing psychological tests.
[01:49:45.670 --> 01:49:49.171]  They're increasing the drugs and making the announcements of what they're doing.
[01:49:50.253 --> 01:49:53.234]  You're being drugged with toxic chemicals.
[01:49:53.274 --> 01:49:54.234]  Do you like it?
[01:49:54.574 --> 01:49:55.694]  Do you enjoy it?
[01:49:56.115 --> 01:50:04.217]  Can't you intellectually, even if you emotionally can't get angry at this, can't you intellectually stop drinking tap water?
[01:50:04.717 --> 01:50:07.618]  Stop eating the highly processed foods with corn syrup?
[01:50:08.058 --> 01:50:13.139]  Don't you care enough to stop giving your kids Coca-Cola and all the stuff that's hurting them?
[01:50:15.353 --> 01:50:18.316]  But no, see, you're at ease from the lithium and fluoride.
[01:50:18.776 --> 01:50:24.602]  You're like, yeah, I understand you're saying I'm being poisoned, but give me a Coke with fluoride.
[01:50:25.583 --> 01:50:26.824]  Give me a Coke with mercury.
[01:50:27.405 --> 01:50:29.587]  Give me that Coke with corn syrup that has the mercury in it.
[01:50:29.967 --> 01:50:30.788]  Give me a Pepsi.
[01:50:31.649 --> 01:50:33.070]  Give me an aspartame bubblegum.
[01:50:33.150 --> 01:50:38.616]  I understand, Alex, you're telling me they're hurting me, but I just don't care.
[01:50:39.690 --> 01:50:50.438]  Because not only are you been drugged, you've been programmed by TV and all the messages to lay down, to be at ease, that everything's entertainment, that everything's fine, that everything's fun.
[01:50:51.879 --> 01:50:57.743]  We're gonna come back, go to your phone calls and cover news for a full hour, and we've got two guests joining us from Copenhagen.

[01:51:57.361 --> 01:51:59.922]  A revolution in smoking is underway.

[01:52:58.424 --> 01:52:59.044]  Hey, everybody.
[01:52:59.124 --> 01:52:59.905]  Alex Jones here.
[01:53:00.445 --> 01:53:02.967]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.

[01:53:21.045 --> 01:53:24.546]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:53:25.087 --> 01:53:30.509]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:53:30.989 --> 01:53:31.890]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:34.231]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank
[01:53:34.756 --> 01:53:39.380]  Go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:44.103]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:44.343 --> 01:53:46.065]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:46.425 --> 01:53:50.508]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[01:54:01.636 --> 01:54:13.589]  All right, William F. Jasper of the New American Magazine will be joining us from Copenhagen, as well as Alex Newman.
[01:54:16.032 --> 01:54:18.955]  So we look forward to having both those gentlemen on together.
[01:54:21.377 --> 01:54:22.638]  I'm about to go to your phone calls.
[01:54:22.858 --> 01:54:34.125]  I do just want to throw out to the listeners, yesterday was the final day to get your orders in and to be guaranteed via UPS to get it delivered before Christmas.
[01:54:34.465 --> 01:54:46.933]  T-shirts, books, films, everything we have to offer in the effort against the New World Order at InfoWars.com and the online video bookstore slash Patriot Gear area.
[01:54:48.513 --> 01:54:51.794]  But most areas of the country take two or three or four days.
[01:54:53.515 --> 01:54:55.556]  And so, it's not guaranteed.
[01:54:55.676 --> 01:54:59.737]  Some areas with UPS, only around Christmas do they say it takes six days.
[01:55:00.398 --> 01:55:02.038]  Most places it's two, three, four days.
[01:55:02.518 --> 01:55:05.119]  When it's non-Christmas, it's guaranteed four days the way we ship it.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:11.442]  But the point is, get your orders in today to get Fall of the Republic
[01:55:12.162 --> 01:55:14.044]  And a free t-shirt of your choice.
[01:55:14.364 --> 01:55:19.089]  An Obama Joker shirt, a Join or Die, Don't Tread on Me shirts.
[01:55:19.769 --> 01:55:22.432]  All available, free, with Fall of the Republic.
[01:55:22.752 --> 01:55:27.497]  A bunch of other combos, a bunch of other specials, for a limited time.
[01:55:29.139 --> 01:55:32.222]  When the Obamas run out, I'm gonna get rid of the free t-shirt deal.
[01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:33.381]  Okay?
[01:55:33.642 --> 01:55:34.522]  And they are running out.
[01:55:34.883 --> 01:55:41.949]  The sizes we've run out of, I added some other variants, varieties of t-shirts that you can get, so everybody can take advantage of it.
[01:55:42.773 --> 01:55:49.055]  We have some other deals where you can get Fall of the Republic and get Reflections and Warnings with Aaron Russo free.
[01:55:49.715 --> 01:55:51.955]  I just want Fall of the Republic in people's hands.
[01:55:52.295 --> 01:55:54.156]  You may know all about the New World Order.
[01:55:54.556 --> 01:55:55.636]  You probably know more than I do.
[01:55:56.016 --> 01:56:00.497]  Does your neighbor, to your friends, to your family, can you present it as well as this film?
[01:56:00.698 --> 01:56:01.358]  Probably not.
[01:56:01.718 --> 01:56:05.999]  I know I couldn't present this information as good as I could in a film because I crafted this.
[01:56:07.841 --> 01:56:10.604]  I mean, my wife saw this and said, this blows all your other films away.
[01:56:10.944 --> 01:56:11.545]  It really does.
[01:56:12.085 --> 01:56:14.027]  The information, the production quality.
[01:56:14.387 --> 01:56:16.149]  People are ready to wake up.
[01:56:17.150 --> 01:56:18.111]  Follow the Republic.
[01:56:18.391 --> 01:56:25.638]  You can also get big deals with Endgame, Obama Deception, Camp FEMA, a bunch of other books and videos that I've produced and that we also carry.
[01:56:25.999 --> 01:56:28.121]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:33.365 --> 01:56:34.726]  And coming up, U.N.
[01:56:34.806 --> 01:56:36.686]  Chief, we will impose global governance.
[01:56:37.046 --> 01:56:37.707]  He gave an L.A.
[01:56:37.747 --> 01:56:39.627]  Times interview and said it again.
[01:56:39.647 --> 01:56:41.268]  He said, we will impose.
[01:56:42.789 --> 01:56:43.789]  Whether you like it or not.
[01:56:43.829 --> 01:56:46.770]  And we got Rothschild on TV talking about how they're going to force it.
[01:56:47.150 --> 01:56:49.451]  I mean, these are dictators, folks, and they must be resisted.
[01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:49.951]  All right.
[01:56:49.971 --> 01:56:51.112]  I'm going to start taking calls.
[01:56:51.432 --> 01:56:52.472]  Julio in Illinois.
[01:56:52.832 --> 01:56:55.333]  Then Eric, Virgil, Allison, Jeff and others.
[01:56:55.654 --> 01:56:56.054]  Go ahead.
[01:56:56.254 --> 01:56:57.114]  You're on the air, Julio.
[01:56:57.974 --> 01:56:59.255]  Alex Jones, Freedom Fighter.
[01:56:59.295 --> 01:57:00.395]  How are you this afternoon, sir?
[01:57:00.575 --> 01:57:01.116]  Good, my friend.
[01:57:01.136 --> 01:57:01.776]  What's on your mind?
[01:57:02.608 --> 01:57:04.909]  Well, it's a beautiful day here in Macomb, Illinois.
[01:57:04.949 --> 01:57:09.932]  Sunny skies and beautiful chemtrails circling through our beautiful city.
[01:57:10.273 --> 01:57:10.733]  Great day.
[01:57:11.333 --> 01:57:14.315]  Well, the brain damage will help us all feel better and submit.
[01:57:14.335 --> 01:57:19.518]  Oh, and the tap water is nothing more than mercury deliciousness.
[01:57:21.199 --> 01:57:21.940]  You're a good American.
[01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:27.471]  Kidding aside, I don't want to be one of those right-wing terrorists.
[01:57:27.551 --> 01:57:35.433]  No, but if you say, I love tyranny, I love brain-damaging my children with chemical weapons in the food and water, then I, like Sean Hannity, say you're a great American.
[01:57:37.554 --> 01:57:39.834]  Well, I'll comment about the show and then a quick question.
[01:57:39.994 --> 01:57:42.095]  Conspiracy Theory, watching it last night with my friends.
[01:57:42.691 --> 01:57:44.573]  I still can't believe that it's on TV.
[01:57:45.033 --> 01:57:46.694]  To me, it's one of the greatest shows of all time.
[01:57:46.715 --> 01:57:49.957]  It's better than anything that's out there right now.
[01:57:49.977 --> 01:57:55.522]  It's better than V or Lost or all those stupid other network... That aren't real.
[01:57:55.542 --> 01:58:00.066]  Let me just add this point and I'll come back to you if you want to finish, Julio, and we'll let everybody else.
[01:58:00.547 --> 01:58:01.908]  This is a key point before I forget it.
[01:58:02.929 --> 01:58:06.612]  In October of last year, Jesse came down for three days and hung out with me.
[01:58:07.845 --> 01:58:09.566]  And I picked his brain, he picked my brain.
[01:58:09.966 --> 01:58:14.388]  I mean, we had dinner a bunch of times, drove around to the Hill Country, hung out with Willie Nelson.
[01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:20.971]  And he was pitching this show, and he said, I will not do it if I don't control it.
[01:58:22.191 --> 01:58:27.834]  And so I immediately wanted to be involved, because if it ever aired, it would be groundbreaking.
[01:58:28.174 --> 01:58:29.254]  And I love to trailblaze.
[01:58:29.415 --> 01:58:36.898]  And I'm playing second or third fiddle on this show, but I'm the only second or third fiddle, and this is very exciting.
[01:58:39.724 --> 01:58:41.785]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.326 --> 01:58:45.667]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:47.568 --> 01:58:52.751]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:57.254]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:58:57.414 --> 01:58:59.275]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:58:59.695 --> 01:59:01.056]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:01.296 --> 01:59:02.357]  There is a solution.
[01:59:02.577 --> 01:59:10.603]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:59:11.004 --> 01:59:18.069]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:24.094]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:59:24.514 --> 01:59:30.099]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:59:42.122 --> 01:59:45.462]  Click on their banner at Infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:00:02.495 --> 02:00:06.658]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:07.318 --> 02:00:08.139]  You want answers?
[02:00:08.899 --> 02:00:09.820]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:14.143]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.643 --> 02:00:18.746]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.426 --> 02:00:22.388]  Okay, Julio, then Eric, Allison, Jeff, and others.
[02:00:22.408 --> 02:00:23.809]  We're going to your calls right now.
[02:00:24.710 --> 02:00:25.991]  Julio, finish up your point.
[02:00:27.647 --> 02:00:29.709]  Yeah, so, Conspiracy Theory, unbelievable show.
[02:00:29.769 --> 02:00:34.291]  It gets people to understand what's really going on in the world and understand the name is always strong.
[02:00:35.012 --> 02:00:39.595]  I learned from the show that he was an oil tycoon, which makes him a greater scum than he already is.
[02:00:39.995 --> 02:00:41.076]  So is Al Gore!
[02:00:41.796 --> 02:00:48.900]  Al Gore is the majority owner of Occidental Petroleum and his companies are the most vicious cutting down rainforests.
[02:00:49.281 --> 02:00:49.441]  See,
[02:00:49.961 --> 02:00:57.805]  It's like Prince Bernhard got caught under the Wild Wildlife Fund hunting elephants and selling their tusks in a huge industrial op.
[02:00:58.345 --> 02:01:00.867]  They're the exact opposite of what they claim to be.
[02:01:00.887 --> 02:01:01.427]  Do you understand?
[02:01:01.447 --> 02:01:09.151]  To my question, Alex, do you think you're talking about them using another false flag attack on the country?
[02:01:09.391 --> 02:01:17.275]  If Copenhagen, if we don't pass it here in this country through our Senate, or if the catastrophe continues down in Copenhagen with all those world-disgusting leaders,
[02:01:18.082 --> 02:01:18.723]  There's a report.
[02:01:18.743 --> 02:01:22.905]  I was wondering if you could take a look at it through StarPage.com, the greatest search engine of all time.
[02:01:23.346 --> 02:01:25.587]  August 1996 from the Air Force.
[02:01:26.248 --> 02:01:27.749]  Weather as a force multiplier.
[02:01:27.849 --> 02:01:28.629]  Owning weather in 2025.
[02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:30.711]  Yeah, no, I've covered that many times, Jim.
[02:01:31.511 --> 02:01:32.552]  Yeah, it's pretty disgusting.
[02:01:32.572 --> 02:01:40.737]  I think this could be it because it says in that document the public will not know whether or not it's an attack from the government or it's a natural occurrence.
[02:01:41.117 --> 02:01:44.400]  Yeah, no, we need to pull that report up and I appreciate your call.
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.221]  What you're getting at is this, and yes.
[02:01:47.461 --> 02:01:49.083]  They can create hurricanes.
[02:01:49.103 --> 02:01:49.883]  They can weaken them.
[02:01:49.903 --> 02:01:50.844]  They can strengthen them.
[02:01:51.645 --> 02:01:52.386]  They can kill them.
[02:01:53.847 --> 02:01:56.530]  They can create other weather systems for more than 50 years.
[02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:58.652]  It's very advanced now.
[02:01:59.593 --> 02:02:02.435]  It's declassified in China, in Europe.
[02:02:02.976 --> 02:02:04.597]  There's UN treaties from the 70s.
[02:02:07.563 --> 02:02:10.524]  And yes, the globalists want to play God.
[02:02:10.564 --> 02:02:12.745]  They're introducing, you gotta be scared of the environment.
[02:02:13.246 --> 02:02:23.250]  No doubt, they are capable of staging environmental crises, a false flag weather event, to then sell global warming.
[02:02:23.530 --> 02:02:26.252]  That's actually coming up in Fall of the Republic 2.
[02:02:27.072 --> 02:02:29.433]  But I haven't named the main name of it yet.
[02:02:30.133 --> 02:02:31.154]  But that's what it's all about.
[02:02:32.054 --> 02:02:35.216]  The eugenics, the master plan, and what they are going to launch.
[02:02:36.161 --> 02:02:38.803]  Alex, it's great to be on your show again.
[02:02:38.823 --> 02:02:40.324]  It's been a while.
[02:02:40.344 --> 02:02:42.345]  I've got a lot to report.
[02:02:42.365 --> 02:02:49.369]  First off, I'd like to thank Julio for his chemtrail report from Illinois, currently here in Southern California.
[02:03:06.118 --> 02:03:07.939]  Yeah, well, the Airwatch group.
[02:03:37.403 --> 02:03:42.804]  Yeah, the California Skywatch now has groups all over the world, and they are chronicling that, and I appreciate your call.
[02:03:44.024 --> 02:03:47.605]  The only issue with chemtrails is people just call in and say, I see them spraying.
[02:03:48.145 --> 02:03:48.685]  Next caller.
[02:03:48.805 --> 02:03:49.705]  I see them spraying.
[02:03:50.065 --> 02:03:53.506]  This plane's at 5,000 feet, laying down giant trails that never dissipate.
[02:03:53.846 --> 02:03:54.686]  I see them spraying.
[02:03:55.406 --> 02:04:05.788]  Instead of teams reading the writings of the White House science czar and the Nobel Prize winner from the early 90s who came up with the plan of chemtrails.
[02:04:06.607 --> 02:04:13.673]  See, no one's out educating others about the source documents of the weather modification program.
[02:04:14.014 --> 02:04:19.538]  That's why Julio's call was good, though he called last week with the same information, about owning the weather in 2025.
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:25.083]  Or you could talk about Army Times, April 27th or 28th.
[02:04:28.963 --> 02:04:36.630]  1997, set deaf, William Cohen says, yes, we control the weather, we can create earthquakes and tsunamis.
[02:04:38.391 --> 02:04:40.473]  I mean, I'm not the one saying that, he's the one saying it.
[02:04:41.635 --> 02:04:42.656]  So, yes.
[02:04:43.817 --> 02:04:44.177]  Yes.
[02:04:44.918 --> 02:04:50.243]  We need to educate people that the government just quietly, just let it slip out,
[02:04:52.233 --> 02:04:53.314]  Like a burp in church.
[02:04:54.134 --> 02:04:55.995]  Yeah, we're spraying you.
[02:04:56.015 --> 02:04:57.036]  It's for your own good.
[02:04:57.116 --> 02:04:57.896]  Now don't worry about it.
[02:04:57.916 --> 02:05:01.658]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:05:01.758 --> 02:05:04.500]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:05.881]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:05:05.901 --> 02:05:06.601]  It's very real.
[02:05:06.721 --> 02:05:08.842]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:05:08.963 --> 02:05:10.483]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:05:57.386 --> 02:06:01.628]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:01.928 --> 02:06:06.011]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:06.271 --> 02:06:11.694]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:12.014 --> 02:06:12.474]  It's true.
[02:06:12.774 --> 02:06:17.317]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:17.637 --> 02:06:18.178]  Number 3.
[02:06:18.458 --> 02:06:21.741]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:25.784]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:25.964 --> 02:06:26.505]  Number 4.
[02:06:26.765 --> 02:06:29.127]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:29.527 --> 02:06:32.910]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:33.190 --> 02:06:33.411]  Number 5.
[02:06:33.971 --> 02:06:37.893]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:38.114 --> 02:06:42.896]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:43.177 --> 02:06:47.199]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:47.359 --> 02:06:48.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:59.073 --> 02:07:02.714]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:03.034 --> 02:07:11.176]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:11.897 --> 02:07:15.938]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:16.538 --> 02:07:27.361]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:27.981 --> 02:07:36.984]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:37.484 --> 02:07:42.546]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:42.926 --> 02:07:50.109]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:50.409 --> 02:07:53.170]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:58.231 --> 02:08:03.253]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:03.613 --> 02:08:05.933]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:05.953 --> 02:08:11.535]  I'm gonna go to Allison, Jeff, Kevin, and Chris here in just a moment.
[02:08:11.555 --> 02:08:15.756]  A toll-free number to join us on this live Thursday, the 17th day of December.
[02:08:15.776 --> 02:08:16.417]  2009 edition is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:24.175 --> 02:08:26.455]  Here's some of the news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:26.996 --> 02:08:29.076]  Left rebels against health reform.
[02:08:29.816 --> 02:08:32.677]  They're now getting a chance to read that it cuts all their health care.
[02:08:35.317 --> 02:08:36.057]  Oh, you gotta love it.
[02:08:37.578 --> 02:08:38.438]  Such a scam.
[02:08:38.458 --> 02:08:39.758]  Just everything goes to the banks.
[02:08:41.038 --> 02:08:43.419]  Senate panel approves Bernanke nomination.
[02:08:43.439 --> 02:08:44.239]  That's bad news.
[02:08:44.879 --> 02:08:48.320]  Nancy Pelosi says climate change summit will create jobs.
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:50.180]  I guess for bureaucrats, yeah.
[02:08:52.381 --> 02:08:55.523]  Predator drones hacked in Iraq operations.
[02:08:56.204 --> 02:08:57.064]  Yeah, hacked!
[02:08:58.965 --> 02:09:02.388]  Climate deal on ships and planes seen slipping away.
[02:09:02.408 --> 02:09:05.490]  Oh, the global tax on that's in trouble right now?
[02:09:08.392 --> 02:09:12.995]  And I want to get back into Rothschild says that people are fighting against global governance agenda.
[02:09:13.615 --> 02:09:15.997]  But the first thing I want to cover is this, then I'm going to your calls.
[02:09:18.181 --> 02:09:24.607]  I got on air as kind of a mainline conservative-leaning libertarian 14 years ago.
[02:09:25.347 --> 02:09:34.916]  I was aware of the Federal Reserve being private and of the globalist agenda, but I was kind of like a mainline Ron Paul supporter.
[02:09:36.557 --> 02:09:39.560]  Started doing a TV show locally on Access.
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.181]  I thought, I've got to get on air, I've got to warn people.
[02:09:42.242 --> 02:09:43.623]  Mainly for Second Amendment issues.
[02:09:44.717 --> 02:09:49.722]  And suddenly old people were calling me that had code enforcers stealing their stuff.
[02:09:50.623 --> 02:09:58.010]  And I found out that the health department, the eugenics department, was set up for eugenics over 100 years ago, worldwide.
[02:09:58.030 --> 02:10:02.574]  Remember I told you they take your baby's blood at birth for 37 years?
[02:10:02.614 --> 02:10:03.575]  Now that's declassified.
[02:10:04.836 --> 02:10:07.018]  Through the health department, which is really an international arm,
[02:10:08.144 --> 02:10:10.346]  That they had databases with hospitals.
[02:10:10.726 --> 02:10:13.629]  And the hospital nurse just thought they were entering into a database.
[02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:15.250]  This was even in the mid-90s.
[02:10:16.431 --> 02:10:19.974]  And it was handwritten reports that were later filed then.
[02:10:20.855 --> 02:10:23.217]  They just thought, oh, is this old person at risk?
[02:10:24.758 --> 02:10:25.819]  So they weren't part of it.
[02:10:25.859 --> 02:10:27.300]  See, you don't know you're part of it.
[02:10:28.582 --> 02:10:35.687]  And if you'd had a heart attack or have cancer, government, people in the city of Austin would go through a database,
[02:10:36.992 --> 02:10:40.457]  And they would find out if you couldn't stand up for yourself.
[02:10:40.917 --> 02:10:43.080]  And they'd do searches and find out if you had family.
[02:10:44.101 --> 02:10:47.666]  And if you lived, say, in a house that was valued at $400,000 on West 37th or whatever,
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:11:00.205]  They would come out and start giving you $2,000 fines a week for a dead spot of grass.
[02:11:00.265 --> 02:11:04.709]  I mean, some of these houses I went to were really nice and they'd call up and go, young man, help me.
[02:11:04.769 --> 02:11:07.691]  I've called the police and judges and they won't help me.
[02:11:07.711 --> 02:11:09.753]  And then I said I wasn't going to pay it.
[02:11:10.053 --> 02:11:11.775]  And the police came and beat me up.
[02:11:14.557 --> 02:11:17.339]  And then they have special units of police that help with this.
[02:11:18.493 --> 02:11:19.734]  You know, it came out in D.C.
[02:11:19.754 --> 02:11:24.959]  they have units of police with wreckers that steal cars, even legally parked, and take them to a chop shop.
[02:11:25.019 --> 02:11:30.563]  I mean, I've seen thousands of articles about this since then, and once a week or so I like to zoom in on one.
[02:11:32.205 --> 02:11:46.097]  But they were working with realtors and key health department and city officials, and they would run up a big debt, didn't say we're going to foreclose on your house, and
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:52.744]  I mean, millions of dollars were being made a week off of this, just robbing old people, mainly.
[02:11:54.405 --> 02:11:56.587]  Then they targeted my grandparents in Austin.
[02:11:56.607 --> 02:11:57.668]  My grandfather's now dead.
[02:11:58.248 --> 02:12:06.455]  The strange twist of fate was, I'd already been in their neighborhood, which was lower, you know, middle class, kind of working class area in South Austin.
[02:12:07.456 --> 02:12:10.118]  It's since gentrified a bit, but working class area.
[02:12:10.598 --> 02:12:14.801]  And I've been around their neighborhood a few times, near this area of Austin where I sit.
[02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:41.992]  It was always, I'd go to somebody's door and the old guy would have had a heart attack, their little elderly wife would be like, they say because there were some boards in the back on the grass that they're gonna take the house and I've got this last month of bills and I don't have $14,000 and the city won't help me and that inspector came and threatened me and ma'am,
[02:12:43.171 --> 02:12:43.891]  When did this happen?
[02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:53.693]  One week after Bill got back after his heart attack and I survived cancer and they told me eldercare said I'll just move in a nursing home.
[02:12:55.453 --> 02:13:10.456]  Well then with my grandparents there was this city gutter about 15 feet behind their little backyard not on their property and they showed up and they said we're gonna give you $2,000 a week fines until you clean out all the
[02:13:11.886 --> 02:13:17.051]  Lumber and junk from years that had flown off the major street into there.
[02:13:18.612 --> 02:13:21.895]  And my grandfather got back there in the summer, cleaned it all out.
[02:13:21.995 --> 02:13:23.497]  I found out once he had the heart attack.
[02:13:23.977 --> 02:13:27.240]  And I showed up out there and found out the whole story.
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:32.725]  And then I fought him off and my dad had to send him the letter for where their property line was.
[02:13:33.065 --> 02:13:35.788]  But the point is they're just viciously feeding on people.
[02:13:36.088 --> 02:13:37.209]  And they're everywhere.
[02:13:38.459 --> 02:13:44.661]  Now under the whole Green Movement, they're going to increase this 20, 30-fold?
[02:13:44.721 --> 02:13:47.262]  I mean, it's literally that... I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:13:50.644 --> 02:13:52.885]  This is out of philly.com.
[02:13:55.005 --> 02:13:56.646]  This is the Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:13:57.807 --> 02:13:59.227]  And there's now a city investigation.
[02:13:59.247 --> 02:14:00.968]  It looks like it's in all the major departments.
[02:14:02.625 --> 02:14:16.294]  The home inspectors and city inspectors and code enforcers acted as a group of bandits, robbing people, kicking old people out, stealing all their property, robbing homes, threatening people for cash payoffs.
[02:14:17.775 --> 02:14:19.537]  And I've seen this in England.
[02:14:19.677 --> 02:14:21.278]  It's all the same.
[02:14:23.117 --> 02:14:27.701]  And as Americans, or as Brits, when a bureaucrat shows up, we just wet ourselves.
[02:14:27.921 --> 02:14:28.781]  You're from the government?
[02:14:29.182 --> 02:14:31.403]  That means I serve you, you are my God.
[02:14:31.944 --> 02:14:32.785]  What can I do?
[02:14:33.905 --> 02:14:34.666]  What can I do?
[02:14:34.686 --> 02:14:37.568]  I just, I'm scared of you.
[02:14:37.608 --> 02:14:38.349]  You're my God.
[02:14:38.369 --> 02:14:39.470]  I'm a coward.
[02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:42.531]  America is about worshipping you.
[02:14:42.611 --> 02:14:44.951]  I see all the TV ads and billboards that you are my God.
[02:14:44.971 --> 02:14:53.214]  And these people just waddle in, stealing houses, stealing goods, kicking people out, and making deals to sell their houses.
[02:14:53.934 --> 02:14:57.656]  Big detailed report, and they just do it here in Austin every day.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:10.206]  And a poor family goes in to have a little kid, baby's blonde-haired, blue eyes, they got a $400,000 bounty on them, they walk in, cops grab the women by the neck and start choking them until they sign the kid over.
[02:15:10.766 --> 02:15:15.929]  I have walked into a hospital room as the cop has his hands around her neck and goes, get out of here!
[02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.709]  Get out of here!
[02:15:17.009 --> 02:15:18.230]  It happened to Mike Hanson, too.
[02:15:18.250 --> 02:15:19.491]  We even have footage of some of it.
[02:15:20.191 --> 02:15:21.772]  I mean, I have seen the hell.
[02:15:22.132 --> 02:15:23.293]  I have seen the torture.
[02:15:23.313 --> 02:15:24.413]  I have seen the evil.
[02:15:24.633 --> 02:15:27.615]  Just everywhere, bleeding, like cess, rising.
[02:15:31.027 --> 02:15:32.247]  Someone's got to stop them.
[02:15:32.848 --> 02:15:34.528]  Someone's got to stand up against them.
[02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:54.575]  City workers who were assigned to clean up blight northeast Philadelphia instead acted like a band of bandits by illegally entering homes and ransacking them of cash, jewelry, TVs, and guns.
[02:15:55.095 --> 02:15:56.996]  Yeah, they would confiscate people's guns, too.
[02:15:58.056 --> 02:15:58.977]  I could arrest you for this!
[02:15:59.297 --> 02:15:59.837]  Ah, mine!
[02:16:00.666 --> 02:16:01.687]  Even though the guns were legal.
[02:16:02.928 --> 02:16:09.015]  There's an attorney, went on to say, and it just talked about how they were robbing everybody and just, it's just unbelievable.
[02:16:10.676 --> 02:16:13.039]  And just taking homes, just whatever they want.
[02:16:14.690 --> 02:16:18.851]  And if you ever resisted them, they just get on their phone and go, I was just assaulted.
[02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:22.072]  And the SWAT team rolls up and you come out or you die.
[02:16:22.092 --> 02:16:23.913]  And they're just like, oh, this country's ours.
[02:16:23.973 --> 02:16:24.673]  Lock and load.
[02:16:25.373 --> 02:16:27.513]  Oh, it feels so good to be a tyrant.
[02:16:28.154 --> 02:16:29.094]  All right, I've said enough.
[02:16:29.154 --> 02:16:31.234]  Let's go ahead and talk to Allison in California.
[02:16:31.675 --> 02:16:32.615]  Allison, you're on the air.
[02:16:32.655 --> 02:16:33.035]  Go ahead.
[02:16:33.055 --> 02:16:34.695]  Hello, Alex.
[02:16:35.436 --> 02:16:38.777]  I'm calling you to hopefully appeal to your trailblazing side.
[02:16:39.897 --> 02:16:43.578]  I wish to tell you information regarding a state-of-the-art
[02:16:44.668 --> 02:16:48.891]  Influence technology that's having a experiment take place on a global level.
[02:16:49.851 --> 02:16:52.073]  It's for a grassroots campaign.
[02:16:52.113 --> 02:16:58.197]  We want your listeners and you to pay attention to this because it's an antithesis to everything that your show is about.
[02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:03.840]  It is a Fireburn Doctors Alert.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:12.846]  It is a means of demonstrating proof to the public and to anybody who participates in this of this influence technology and it's a
[02:17:13.576 --> 02:17:21.459]  It's a very simple experiment and it's demonstrated on fire burns, on burns that happen regularly in people's homes, on terrorist bombings.
[02:17:21.539 --> 02:17:23.599]  It could be troops in Afghanistan.
[02:17:23.639 --> 02:17:24.480]  Okay, explain it to me.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.862]  What people need to do is give their name, their date of birth, their place of birth, and if possible a picture on a camera cell phone.
[02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:36.011]  Oh ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:17:36.331 --> 02:17:37.732]  You've got to tell me what this is.
[02:17:38.113 --> 02:17:40.094]  You talk about influence technologies.
[02:17:41.095 --> 02:17:43.696]  You start talking about burns.
[02:17:44.317 --> 02:17:45.898]  Explain to me what you're saying first.
[02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:52.582]  Well, it's an experiment to demonstrate proof of the effectiveness of this influence technology.
[02:17:53.257 --> 02:17:56.280]  And it's for the public to call in that number, that 818-332-6645.
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:58.922]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:17:59.162 --> 02:17:59.723]  Put her on hold.
[02:18:00.083 --> 02:18:01.284]  Ma'am, I... Listen.
[02:18:02.105 --> 02:18:05.228]  You can't just call in and give your phone number out.
[02:18:05.248 --> 02:18:09.311]  I mean, it could be... I don't think you're doing this, but we've had this happen before.
[02:18:09.571 --> 02:18:12.214]  You could be giving your ex-husband's number out you don't like.
[02:18:13.194 --> 02:18:13.534]  Okay?
[02:18:13.834 --> 02:18:16.176]  And then we get threatened with lawsuits.
[02:18:16.876 --> 02:18:21.719]  So number one, I don't like people giving their full name if I don't know who they are and I can't prove it.
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:25.421]  I'm Bill Johnson and I'm going to do this to Judge Billy Bob.
[02:18:25.782 --> 02:18:26.602]  You can't do that.
[02:18:27.062 --> 02:18:28.743]  You can't call in and give phone numbers out.
[02:18:30.444 --> 02:18:34.707]  I'm a little more lenient with 1-800s because those generally aren't going to be some private person's number.
[02:18:35.768 --> 02:18:36.048]  Okay?
[02:18:37.759 --> 02:18:47.647]  I know for at least 20 years, shopping malls and casinos have ultra-low audio under the music telling you, buy, buy, relax, everything's great, everything's good.
[02:18:48.107 --> 02:18:50.109]  Casinos do pump oxygen in.
[02:18:51.009 --> 02:18:57.435]  I know that in the 50s, they had ads for Coca-Cola flashing an image of a desert, and it doubled Coke sales.
[02:18:57.875 --> 02:19:00.737]  I know there's subliminals, they teach it in basic advertising.
[02:19:02.078 --> 02:19:06.782]  I know that there's all sorts of mind control systems being deployed.
[02:19:07.819 --> 02:19:08.199]  Okay?
[02:19:08.319 --> 02:19:09.620]  There's a lot of it going on.
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:18.203]  But just to call in and say, people can call this number and demonstrate something, you have to tell me what this is first.
[02:19:19.083 --> 02:19:19.324]  Okay?
[02:19:19.344 --> 02:19:25.666]  You have to explain to me what the test is, what the group is, what this phone number is, that you're going to give out.
[02:19:26.086 --> 02:19:26.286]  Okay?
[02:19:26.306 --> 02:19:28.847]  You're talking about my trailblazing spirit.
[02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:30.208]  I trailblaze what I can prove.
[02:19:31.167 --> 02:19:39.714]  Okay, and I can't get people to wake up to that, so I'll see what you have to say, Allison, when we come back briefly, if you can just refrain from giving the phone number out for a minute to answer my question.
[02:19:40.414 --> 02:19:43.957]  Then we'll talk to Jeff, Kevin, Chris, and Mark.
[02:19:43.977 --> 02:19:46.779]  I'm going to try to hurry through your calls, but all these calls are very informative.
[02:19:47.639 --> 02:19:56.226]  And we're also going to get into the latest on the government takeover of health care, and what's happening in Copenhagen, Denmark, Schwarzenegger's agenda to take over your town and city.
[02:19:56.246 --> 02:19:57.487]  He needs to be arrested.
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:07.240]  I think so.
[02:20:29.445 --> 02:20:29.985]  We're good to go!
[02:20:59.298 --> 02:21:02.945]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:03.325 --> 02:21:06.331]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:06.571 --> 02:21:07.974]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:21:08.675 --> 02:21:11.356]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:12.116 --> 02:21:17.598]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:17.738 --> 02:21:22.780]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:32.924]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world governments.
[02:21:33.044 --> 02:21:35.145]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:35.385 --> 02:21:36.725]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:36.965 --> 02:21:39.246]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:39.426 --> 02:21:41.266]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:41.286 --> 02:21:46.348]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:46.708 --> 02:21:51.489]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:51.709 --> 02:21:55.811]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:57.742 --> 02:22:07.489]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:07.769 --> 02:22:13.813]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:14.214 --> 02:22:23.060]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:32.344]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:32.625 --> 02:22:37.207]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:37.227 --> 02:22:38.788]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.028 --> 02:22:41.509]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:41.809 --> 02:22:43.310]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.131 --> 02:22:48.954]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:22:49.314 --> 02:22:50.175]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.195 --> 02:22:50.555]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.762 --> 02:22:59.823]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[02:23:00.444 --> 02:23:01.865]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[02:23:02.285 --> 02:23:03.706]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[02:23:04.086 --> 02:23:07.629]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[02:23:08.049 --> 02:23:12.232]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[02:23:12.592 --> 02:23:17.195]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[02:23:17.575 --> 02:23:22.658]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[02:23:23.038 --> 02:23:31.763]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 saw paw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:34.884]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[02:23:35.145 --> 02:23:36.565]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[02:23:36.825 --> 02:23:39.667]  To get your free bottle of Beta Prostate, call 1-800-360-8306.
[02:23:39.687 --> 02:23:39.887]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[02:23:45.390 --> 02:23:48.072]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[02:23:48.392 --> 02:23:50.993]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[02:23:51.253 --> 02:23:51.533]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[02:23:51.553 --> 02:23:51.754]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[02:23:51.794 --> 02:23:52.954]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[02:23:52.974 --> 02:23:53.415]  This is the end,
[02:24:24.816 --> 02:24:27.298]  Okay, is Allison still there?
[02:24:28.518 --> 02:24:31.340]  Allison, can you tell me specifically what this test is?
[02:24:32.481 --> 02:24:38.345]  It's about getting proof to the public of our groundbreaking influence technology which helps people.
[02:24:38.745 --> 02:24:40.006]  It heals burns in minutes.
[02:24:40.506 --> 02:24:42.107]  It stops pain in minutes.
[02:24:42.751 --> 02:24:43.011]  I think?
[02:25:13.228 --> 02:25:23.959]  Much of the public relations and the press relations for the United Nations is actually handled by a private organization, which is called the Communications Committee for the United Nations.
[02:25:24.099 --> 02:25:26.201]  They are basically a collection of people.
[02:25:26.261 --> 02:25:28.424]  They typically have cable TV shows.
[02:25:28.864 --> 02:25:33.148]  They will have on-air shows, syndicated TV shows, webcams, that kind of thing.
[02:25:33.168 --> 02:25:35.591]  They tend to be that level of media and above.
[02:25:36.147 --> 02:25:41.528]  And they have their employees of CBS, their employees of major media, that type of thing.
[02:25:41.728 --> 02:25:44.629]  Yeah, the UN has its people everywhere, that's Agenda 21.
[02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:46.730]  Right, exactly.
[02:25:47.130 --> 02:25:51.311]  Now the thing is that every year they have their annual gathering.
[02:25:51.771 --> 02:26:01.253]  And what's happened is it has become a place where local patriots from all over the Northeast show up and have a
[02:26:02.129 --> 02:26:10.577]  Uh, a dialogue with these people, and you'd be surprised how accommodating they are, because they need lively guests on their programs.
[02:26:10.657 --> 02:26:14.240]  Otherwise, their programs turn into Radio Cuba, which nobody wants to listen to.
[02:26:14.901 --> 02:26:16.903]  So, every year they have this gathering.
[02:26:16.963 --> 02:26:19.305]  It is an open-door party, okay?
[02:26:19.325 --> 02:26:21.787]  Well, open-door gathering, Christmas gathering.
[02:26:22.588 --> 02:26:26.512]  Uh, basically, it is going to be held this Friday, okay?
[02:26:27.097 --> 02:26:27.398]  I think so.
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:45.141]  It's going to be at 241 West 36th Street.
[02:26:45.221 --> 02:26:48.042]  If you know Manhattan, that's between 7th and 8th Avenue.
[02:26:49.422 --> 02:26:51.943]  Oh yeah, these globalists love to try to sell you.
[02:26:51.963 --> 02:26:57.524]  That's why Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, came on this show trying to sell me on world government.
[02:26:58.024 --> 02:27:04.686]  So see, they'll try to sell you individually, but then meanwhile say, it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, but we need world government.
[02:27:06.167 --> 02:27:08.127]  So what's the official name of this party?
[02:27:09.548 --> 02:27:11.128]  It's the Communications Committee.
[02:27:11.841 --> 02:27:12.882]  The United Nations.
[02:27:13.603 --> 02:27:14.784]  It's held every year.
[02:27:15.584 --> 02:27:16.785]  And it's this year.
[02:27:16.805 --> 02:27:17.526]  It's December 18th.
[02:27:17.646 --> 02:27:20.268]  It's going to be from 9 p.m.
[02:27:20.789 --> 02:27:20.989]  on.
[02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:30.517]  It's going to be a 241 West 36, 241 West 36, 36th Street between 7th and 8th Avenue on the north side of the street.
[02:27:31.017 --> 02:27:37.042]  The guy heads it as a complete, he has one of these apartments in an old loft.
[02:27:37.777 --> 02:27:39.599]  Which basically is like a ten room apartment.
[02:27:39.779 --> 02:27:40.339]  All right, interesting.
[02:27:40.379 --> 02:27:41.240]  I appreciate your call.
[02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:41.941]  That's great.
[02:27:42.241 --> 02:27:46.204]  Yeah, there's all sorts of interesting globalist events always going on in your town or city.
[02:27:46.745 --> 02:27:48.666]  And it's good to go attend the public events.
[02:27:49.547 --> 02:27:51.348]  And they're slick.
[02:27:51.388 --> 02:27:52.950]  They'll try to turn you to the dark side.
[02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:55.832]  But take some of my videos there.
[02:27:55.852 --> 02:27:57.633]  Take Fall the Republic and educate people.
[02:27:58.074 --> 02:27:59.495]  That's a great call, Jeff.
[02:27:59.515 --> 02:28:00.015]  Thank you.
[02:28:00.436 --> 02:28:01.757]  Let's talk to Kevin and Mass.
[02:28:01.797 --> 02:28:02.658]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:28:04.019 --> 02:28:05.520]  Alex, great to talk to you, buddy.
[02:28:06.175 --> 02:28:11.979]  Hey, I just want to thank you for all you're doing with the vaccine, waking people up over here.
[02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:28.532]  I'm originally from New York and they were, Richard Danes, the state health commissioner over there in New York, was trying to force the healthcare workers over there in August, he put out a vaccination requirement for them or their jobs were at stake.
[02:28:28.993 --> 02:28:37.798]  And I just want to thank you, Alex, for all you do and how you show people to get a spine and to stand up for themselves.
[02:28:38.679 --> 02:28:40.140]  God bless you, but let me just make this point.
[02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:43.502]  This is a great point you're leading into here.
[02:28:44.834 --> 02:28:46.255]  We were all going to have to take it.
[02:28:46.275 --> 02:28:47.515]  It was going to be the law.
[02:28:47.856 --> 02:28:49.176]  Millions were going to die.
[02:28:49.396 --> 02:28:50.597]  The flu was going to kill us.
[02:28:51.197 --> 02:28:56.600]  Now indictments are beginning of EU members, UN, WHO members.
[02:28:56.980 --> 02:29:00.822]  As it comes out, they lied to make money and to push the vaccine.
[02:29:01.262 --> 02:29:03.223]  And almost no one's taking the shot.
[02:29:03.603 --> 02:29:10.066]  Hundreds of millions of dosages are rotting in the North, in Canada, in the U.S., in England.
[02:29:10.866 --> 02:29:17.353]  And it blew up in their face because we got the word out and educated people about what was on the inserts.
[02:29:17.393 --> 02:29:17.834]  So go ahead.
[02:29:19.352 --> 02:29:34.615]  Well, I wanted to put a warning out there, too, Alex, because what they're doing now, as you know how they spin everything, what happened was a temporary restraining order was issued by Judge McNamara, the acting state Supreme Court justice over there.
[02:29:34.675 --> 02:29:36.416]  Stay there, stay there, stay there, Kevin, yeah.
[02:29:36.836 --> 02:29:46.498]  Mass passed a law to conform with Bush's and Obama's executive orders that they could quarantine you, arrest you, imprison you, forcibly inoculate you.
[02:29:48.638 --> 02:29:51.625]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.567 --> 02:29:55.253]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.959 --> 02:30:02.623]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:02.643 --> 02:30:05.987]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:06.227 --> 02:30:11.013]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:11.033 --> 02:30:17.260]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:19.663]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:20.163 --> 02:30:21.785]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:30:21.805 --> 02:30:22.906]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:22.926 --> 02:30:25.208]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:39.082 --> 02:30:43.005]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:30:43.465 --> 02:30:46.047]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:46.367 --> 02:30:55.474]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:30:58.154 --> 02:31:00.756]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:01.156 --> 02:31:06.120]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:06.501 --> 02:31:08.222]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:08.542 --> 02:31:13.346]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:13.546 --> 02:31:14.507]  How much do you want?
[02:31:14.727 --> 02:31:15.468]  When do you want it?
[02:31:15.848 --> 02:31:17.449]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:17.729 --> 02:31:18.550]  When will you need it?
[02:31:18.810 --> 02:31:20.872]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:21.012 --> 02:31:22.113]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:22.353 --> 02:31:23.654]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:23.874 --> 02:31:28.940]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:29.121 --> 02:31:32.345]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:32.725 --> 02:31:36.229]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:37.531]  How much will you need?
[02:31:37.771 --> 02:31:38.372]  We don't know.
[02:31:38.673 --> 02:31:39.594]  How much do you want?
[02:31:39.774 --> 02:31:40.495]  All you can get.
[02:31:40.515 --> 02:31:41.096]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:41.776 --> 02:31:42.197]  I think so.
[02:31:57.091 --> 02:32:03.934]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:04.074 --> 02:32:06.034]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:32:06.154 --> 02:32:08.295]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:08.395 --> 02:32:09.916]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:32:10.056 --> 02:32:14.397]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:32:14.537 --> 02:32:16.898]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:32:44.897 --> 02:32:46.838]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:32:46.858 --> 02:32:49.440]  There has been a huge new development on the front with Russia.
[02:33:10.538 --> 02:33:18.983]  The Cold War is back in a big wave after NATO forces launched a sneak attack on 888 against Russia, which was real.
[02:33:20.604 --> 02:33:29.530]  They are now threatening preemptive nuclear attacks on Western Europe if any more of these attacks are launched or are prepared to be launched.
[02:33:32.932 --> 02:33:36.154]  The world is in the greatest danger it's ever been in and it's just going to get worse from here.
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:40.621]  I'm going to break this down later.
[02:33:40.721 --> 02:33:44.123]  I have two guests from Copenhagen joining us, but let's get through your calls now.
[02:33:44.683 --> 02:33:50.247]  So Kevin and Mass, yes, they've ordered all the police, medical workers inoculated.
[02:33:51.168 --> 02:33:53.709]  The order says they can make the population take shots.
[02:33:54.290 --> 02:33:55.410]  Everybody started rebelling.
[02:33:55.570 --> 02:33:56.511]  New York rebelled.
[02:33:57.312 --> 02:33:58.212]  Their nurses rebelled.
[02:33:58.252 --> 02:34:00.854]  That got blocked at their Supreme Court level.
[02:34:01.274 --> 02:34:02.815]  All you got was an injunction.
[02:34:03.215 --> 02:34:04.356]  So now they're spinning it.
[02:34:04.396 --> 02:34:05.257]  I saw this in the news.
[02:34:05.297 --> 02:34:06.017]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:34:06.477 --> 02:34:08.579]  Oh, now you've still got to take the shot.
[02:34:09.099 --> 02:34:12.282]  In Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, you've got to take the shot.
[02:34:12.342 --> 02:34:16.506]  Their asinine point is, well, you might get flu and give it to somebody else.
[02:34:16.546 --> 02:34:21.310]  But wait, the idiots that want it can take it and get the flu and die or get sick or get cancer.
[02:34:21.831 --> 02:34:22.572]  We know it's in there.
[02:34:22.632 --> 02:34:23.592]  We know it's on the insert.
[02:34:24.553 --> 02:34:29.378]  How, if you don't take it, how does that make somebody else sick who has taken it?
[02:34:29.418 --> 02:34:30.579]  But go ahead and make your point.
[02:34:31.957 --> 02:34:34.759]  Well my point was, Alex, is I want people not to give up.
[02:34:34.819 --> 02:34:40.902]  Because as you preach too, you have to stand up to get these tyrants to back down.
[02:34:41.162 --> 02:34:44.324]  And they don't want to admit the reason why they backed down is because we stood up.
[02:34:44.745 --> 02:34:52.209]  And now the temporary injunction, they use the reason, well, we backed off of this because, you know, we didn't have enough
[02:34:52.719 --> 02:34:58.444]  ...vaccine to go around, so we want to focus on your little children and the elderly people.
[02:34:58.784 --> 02:35:12.697]  Meanwhile, you and I both know they want to kill our future and our past, so the mind-controlled, uh, mainstream people... Yeah, they're dosing more than half the corn syrup products with mercury on purpose, Washington Post, and I mean, oh, but they care about the children.
[02:35:14.358 --> 02:35:14.638]  Right.
[02:35:15.018 --> 02:35:27.346]  And you know, if they eliminate the future and eliminate the past, then they'll just have their mind controlled, you know, 25 to 45 year old people here that can still work and be their slaves.
[02:35:27.766 --> 02:35:35.031]  And now with the robotics going in and all the new high tech, Kurzweil and all the globalists say they don't want us anymore.
[02:35:35.671 --> 02:35:36.592]  That's the whole point.
[02:35:36.632 --> 02:35:37.713]  They want to cull us down.
[02:35:38.635 --> 02:35:45.299]  To 5 to 15 to 20 percent, they debate that, to a couple hundred million people, and then that's it.
[02:35:45.699 --> 02:35:47.880]  And we're just there for them to toy with.
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:51.022]  No, you're not our gods, you're not our masters, criminals.
[02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:55.644]  See, they just dress up like they're our authorities and say, we are your masters, we own you now.
[02:35:56.024 --> 02:35:57.205]  No, it's over, criminals.
[02:35:57.425 --> 02:35:58.085]  You're gonna lose.
[02:35:58.145 --> 02:35:59.126]  I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[02:36:00.126 --> 02:36:02.368]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:36:02.408 --> 02:36:02.908]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:36:04.172 --> 02:36:18.571]  Well, Kevin just brought up the interesting issue of vaccinations, and I had the pleasure of interviewing William Maxfield, MD, who says that on my radio show, Liberation Station, and he says that subcutaneous injection of the
[02:36:19.452 --> 02:36:20.352]  It's not side effects.
[02:36:20.733 --> 02:36:22.453]  A side effect means they didn't mean it to happen.
[02:36:38.679 --> 02:36:39.500]  Yeah, they're deadly.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:40.900]  I would never take one myself.
[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:49.725]  I just want everyone to understand that they're trying to give us the most deadly serum possible by intramuscular rather than subcutaneous injection.
[02:36:50.305 --> 02:36:58.249]  And I wanted to expand a little bit on, I called you on the weekend, a couple weekends ago, about this atmospheric science program from the Department of Energy.
[02:36:58.909 --> 02:36:59.690]  We're good to go.
[02:37:19.868 --> 02:37:23.012]  Yeah, let me stop you, sir.
[02:37:23.252 --> 02:37:29.818]  I haven't seen that particular document because literally, in the last three years or so intensely, since the mid-90s I've been researching it,
[02:37:40.390 --> 02:37:42.172]  It's kind of like the JFK assassination.
[02:37:42.212 --> 02:37:42.852]  I get into it.
[02:37:42.872 --> 02:37:44.374]  I've been making a film for five years.
[02:37:44.954 --> 02:37:47.837]  With chemtrails, I've had cameramen all over the country.
[02:37:47.877 --> 02:37:49.058]  I've got government documents.
[02:37:49.119 --> 02:37:55.224]  I've got videos of science firms at the UN admitting what they're doing to us.
[02:37:55.925 --> 02:37:57.186]  And that's the point.
[02:37:57.226 --> 02:37:59.529]  I'm glad you called in about an actual document.
[02:37:59.989 --> 02:38:04.470]  Because there's so many where they just admit they're already manipulating the atmosphere.
[02:38:04.830 --> 02:38:06.131]  So what are they talking about?
[02:38:06.291 --> 02:38:09.952]  Oh, we better have taxes or the atmosphere will deteriorate.
[02:38:10.352 --> 02:38:14.153]  When we actually look at what they're spraying, it does mess up our atmosphere.
[02:38:14.213 --> 02:38:19.894]  So they're messing up the atmosphere, while meanwhile saying get ready for big calamities.
[02:38:19.934 --> 02:38:20.754]  This is a big deal.
[02:38:21.035 --> 02:38:22.075]  But real fast,
[02:38:23.547 --> 02:38:29.534]  Give me the name of that particular atmospheric manipulation paper by the Department of Energy.
[02:38:29.594 --> 02:38:38.623]  I'm familiar with, literally, you put in these terms, you get millions of papers and documents and every major university involved and every major federal department involved.
[02:38:39.104 --> 02:39:00.315]  International treaties and they're spraying us everywhere and poisoning the water and giggling and snickering and they I mean it's so funny to them And the news is now going you may need drugs in the water to make you behave So they're now introducing to the slaves, you know, they're already drugging the water But now they're letting the slaves know like ten years after the cell phones are used to track you.
[02:39:00.335 --> 02:39:07.399]  They now tell the slaves Also email that to show tips and info wars comm all your government documents about Kim trails.
[02:39:07.419 --> 02:39:07.960]  We should just start
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:14.424]  Posting a raw area of just the documents themselves, instead of just telling people where the documents are.
[02:39:14.725 --> 02:39:16.846]  Give me the name real fast of that document again.
[02:39:16.866 --> 02:39:33.159]  Do a web search for DOE for Department of Energy, Atmospheric Science Program, or just go to www.asp for Atmospheric Science Program, dot B as in boy, N as in Nancy, L as in Larry, dot gov.
[02:39:33.899 --> 02:39:38.303]  No, no, I understand their site, but I mean, what's the particular name of this paper, or this group?
[02:39:39.335 --> 02:39:41.196]  The Atmospheric Science Program.
[02:39:41.997 --> 02:39:48.962]  Yes, and it was last updated November 12th, and it talks about cloud interactions, aerosol and cloud-related research components.
[02:39:49.642 --> 02:39:50.983]  Oh, I've seen that.
[02:39:51.844 --> 02:39:56.287]  October, the Atmospheric Science Program and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program.
[02:39:56.747 --> 02:40:02.391]  But, you know, they know that they're messing with our DNA, and there are things we can do about it, like food-grade diatomaceous earth.
[02:40:02.952 --> 02:40:07.235]  And something I recently discovered is just amazing for so many things, is Kangen water.
[02:40:08.195 --> 02:40:12.177]  Kangen water has just made a great difference in my life and many of my friends.
[02:40:12.257 --> 02:40:15.138]  It's a medical device in Japan and Canada more recently.
[02:40:15.198 --> 02:40:21.160]  It's great for detoxifying, alkalinizing, energizing, and it's helped so many diseases and conditions.
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:23.521]  It has decades worth of research on it.
[02:40:23.541 --> 02:40:27.782]  I'll send you more information on that also, but that's just a very inexpensive cure-all.
[02:40:28.102 --> 02:40:28.602]  Thanks a lot.
[02:40:28.622 --> 02:40:29.663]  I gotta get to other callers.
[02:40:30.083 --> 02:40:31.723]  I really appreciate that call, Chris.
[02:40:32.524 --> 02:40:33.824]  Ron in Texas, go ahead.
[02:40:35.745 --> 02:40:36.065]  Nope.
[02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:37.050]  Yeah buddy.
[02:40:37.751 --> 02:40:38.611]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:40:38.671 --> 02:40:39.531]  Great to talk to you again.
[02:40:39.872 --> 02:40:41.713]  Good to talk to you.
[02:40:42.293 --> 02:40:49.677]  I was just wanting to know, I was in the middle of doing some stuff and I heard bits and pieces of your conversation with Lloyd Mompton.
[02:40:50.477 --> 02:40:57.781]  And what he was saying about this globalization treaty thing with Copenhagen.
[02:40:58.567 --> 02:41:01.568]  My understanding was that it's still in a stalemate.
[02:41:02.209 --> 02:41:02.749]  Is that correct?
[02:41:03.129 --> 02:41:06.010]  No, they say that to make you stand down.
[02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:07.491]  It's a political trick.
[02:41:07.751 --> 02:41:20.196]  They're not going to be able to get, we hope, it looks like, by tomorrow night, an open treaty waiving everything to global government and establishing all the taxes now.
[02:41:21.272 --> 02:41:28.527]  Instead, they're going to agree to an intergovernmental agreement to fund bureaucracies and...
[02:41:29.582 --> 02:41:30.682]  So do it illegally.
[02:41:31.002 --> 02:41:45.286]  And Schwarzenegger has had meetings chairing the group of mayors and governors, that's AP, AFP, and Reuters, that he will lead a global group to bypass national governments and implement at the city and county level.
[02:41:45.666 --> 02:41:46.786]  Sir, that's already happening.
[02:41:47.346 --> 02:41:51.267]  I mean, the city of Austin is run by the United Nations publicly.
[02:41:51.767 --> 02:42:02.169]  I mean, they openly are run, the police are trained by UN programs, they have exchange programs, they have a former special forces commander who runs the environmental program.
[02:42:02.809 --> 02:42:07.930]  I mean, this is a cold-blooded group of people, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:13.371]  And so, look, again, Schwarzenegger's just publicly announcing what they're already doing.
[02:42:13.831 --> 02:42:17.192]  They've got their operatives over all the major school districts, everything.
[02:42:18.994 --> 02:42:20.335]  This is a takeover, sir.
[02:42:20.355 --> 02:42:21.996]  This is an infiltration.
[02:42:22.857 --> 02:42:25.719]  Yeah, I figured that much.
[02:42:25.779 --> 02:42:36.346]  I just wanted to get a good confirmation of what he was saying, because like I said, the only way I can hear you is over the internet, because I only live like an hour away from where you're broadcasting, but for some reason, I can't pick you up on the radio.
[02:42:37.527 --> 02:42:38.148]  Where are you?
[02:42:38.488 --> 02:42:40.109]  I'm in Killeen, actually.
[02:42:41.350 --> 02:42:42.291]  You can pick up the show.
[02:42:43.208 --> 02:42:44.689]  Yeah, I tried, but I can't seem to find it.
[02:42:44.889 --> 02:42:46.190]  No, you can pick it up.
[02:42:46.610 --> 02:42:49.272]  They carry, I think, three hours a day at 1330.
[02:42:50.453 --> 02:42:50.713]  Okay.
[02:42:51.213 --> 02:42:52.474]  I'll see if I can find it.
[02:42:52.494 --> 02:42:55.817]  1330 comes in clear as a whistle where you live.
[02:42:56.477 --> 02:42:56.737]  Great.
[02:42:56.957 --> 02:42:59.199]  I'll try a different radio then.
[02:42:59.219 --> 02:42:59.979]  Have you tried 1330?
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:00.820]  What's that?
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:01.400]  Have you tried 1330?
[02:43:05.916 --> 02:43:11.838]  For some reason, I guess maybe in the area that I live, it's very hard for me to pick up some radio stations.
[02:43:12.138 --> 02:43:13.458]  Are you near power lines?
[02:43:14.098 --> 02:43:19.400]  A lot, and I got a lot of Black Hawk helicopter traffic and longboat traffic.
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:22.021]  Yeah, you may have some big government transmitters that interfere.
[02:43:23.021 --> 02:43:27.344]  For some reason, 590 AM is a blowtorch that covers more than half of Texas.
[02:43:27.804 --> 02:43:27.924]  Yeah.
[02:43:27.964 --> 02:43:34.548]  And sometimes, if I'm in one room of my house, it won't even come in during the daytime when it's at full power.
[02:43:34.868 --> 02:43:35.909]  So AM's a weird thing.
[02:43:35.929 --> 02:43:36.969]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:43:36.989 --> 02:43:37.550]  I'm going to jump.
[02:43:37.770 --> 02:43:39.431]  I've got to get this news before our guests come up.
[02:43:39.751 --> 02:43:40.711]  Thank you so much, Ron.
[02:43:41.172 --> 02:43:42.493]  Let's talk to Ron in Georgia.
[02:43:42.553 --> 02:43:43.093]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:43:43.853 --> 02:43:44.534]  Alex Jones.
[02:43:44.694 --> 02:43:46.555]  I've been waiting three years to talk to you, son.
[02:43:47.135 --> 02:43:47.756]  Well, here we are.
[02:43:48.436 --> 02:43:49.116]  Here you are.
[02:43:51.167 --> 02:43:55.749]  I heard a guy talk about two weeks ago about how we were going to be defeated.
[02:43:56.829 --> 02:43:57.209]  Bull.
[02:43:57.729 --> 02:43:59.190]  We are not going to be defeated.
[02:44:00.110 --> 02:44:03.651]  This is how we educate your children.
[02:44:05.652 --> 02:44:10.534]  Well, we know we're going to get defeated if we bend over and say, I'm your slave.
[02:44:12.654 --> 02:44:14.535]  I cried my eyes out.
[02:44:16.204 --> 02:44:20.006]  Last week, my daughter had a... She's 11 years old.
[02:44:21.127 --> 02:44:23.148]  I raised two kids.
[02:44:23.369 --> 02:44:25.690]  One's autistic and my daughter.
[02:44:26.611 --> 02:44:27.691]  One's been vaccinated.
[02:44:27.711 --> 02:44:30.253]  One hasn't.
[02:44:32.174 --> 02:44:35.736]  Okay, my 11-year-old daughter had a paper to write for school.
[02:44:37.097 --> 02:44:44.362]  She wrote on the... She wrote a paper on having the IRS
[02:44:47.915 --> 02:44:48.495]  Be gone.
[02:44:49.556 --> 02:44:51.877]  And that's her right as an American to have free speech.
[02:44:51.937 --> 02:44:52.517]  What happened?
[02:44:53.778 --> 02:44:55.619]  Oh, no, she got an A. Oh, good.
[02:44:55.659 --> 02:44:56.640]  Well, the teacher's awake then.
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:56.900]  Good.
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:57.860]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:58.201 --> 02:44:59.521]  So you cried for happiness.
[02:45:00.001 --> 02:45:01.502]  Tell you what, everybody's awake here.
[02:45:03.003 --> 02:45:04.024]  Everybody's awake here.
[02:45:04.104 --> 02:45:06.525]  She did a paper on Hitler last year.
[02:45:07.606 --> 02:45:15.670]  I got called into the principal's office because she exposed that Prescott Bush funded Hitler.
[02:45:16.681 --> 02:45:18.102]  Well, that was in the New York Times.
[02:45:18.162 --> 02:45:19.582]  What, she's not allowed to report on that?
[02:45:20.342 --> 02:45:21.923]  Well, they wanted to know.
[02:45:21.963 --> 02:45:25.384]  The principal wanted to know where she got her information from.
[02:45:25.404 --> 02:45:28.425]  And I said, well, she got it from me.
[02:45:28.846 --> 02:45:29.986]  She got it from the internet.
[02:45:30.326 --> 02:45:30.946]  It's right there.
[02:45:32.267 --> 02:45:35.788]  And the principal said, well, you know, I have a doctorate.
[02:45:36.528 --> 02:45:38.249]  Big deal.
[02:45:40.470 --> 02:45:43.711]  And I said, well, apparently you've been reading the wrong books, woman.
[02:45:44.191 --> 02:45:45.992]  You know, I didn't know what else to say.
[02:45:47.439 --> 02:45:49.621]  Well, let me give her sources then.
[02:45:49.961 --> 02:46:00.511]  The McCormick-Dickstein Committee of Congress, the books written by Marine Corps General Smedley Butler,
[02:46:02.046 --> 02:46:03.007]  You're so awesome.
[02:46:31.443 --> 02:46:31.983]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:46:32.163 --> 02:46:32.983]  The London Guardian.
[02:46:33.203 --> 02:46:34.624]  Well, Harry, let's read this for the teacher.
[02:46:34.644 --> 02:46:39.925]  I mean, the moron principal can figure this out, but they've got a doctorate, which means they know how to be a moron.
[02:46:40.425 --> 02:46:40.985]  It goes on.
[02:46:41.205 --> 02:46:44.825]  Hal Bush's grandfather helped Hitler's rise to power.
[02:46:46.966 --> 02:46:48.386]  So, I mean, there's the London Guardian.
[02:46:48.426 --> 02:46:49.846]  I mean, I don't know what they want.
[02:46:51.867 --> 02:46:56.387]  So, how did this end with the... How did this end with the principal?
[02:46:57.568 --> 02:46:58.908]  Oh, well, I'm on the...
[02:47:00.538 --> 02:47:02.019]  No talk list, but whatever.
[02:47:02.699 --> 02:47:25.672]  As an aside, Alex, before you let me go, Neil Bort, which is one of the biggest putschists in the world, last Friday, December 11th, called for an economic refugee camp because he does not want to live next to poor people.
[02:47:26.195 --> 02:47:28.036]  And that's what Schwarzenegger's doing.
[02:47:28.436 --> 02:47:32.039]  He now arrests the homeless people, even though they're in their own little camper.
[02:47:32.059 --> 02:47:38.663]  I mean, people get bankrupt, they get a little camper, they're living in it at a city park, you know, driving around, even with jobs.
[02:47:38.903 --> 02:47:41.444]  They come arrest you, take it, laugh at you.
[02:47:41.804 --> 02:47:43.806]  At night you get locked up in these poor houses.
[02:47:44.406 --> 02:47:45.867]  It's happening, Alex.
[02:47:45.967 --> 02:47:49.048]  It's happening in front of people's faces and they can't see it.
[02:47:49.348 --> 02:47:54.850]  But see, Neil Bortz, next it'll be, next it'll be, let's make them work in these work camps.
[02:47:55.270 --> 02:47:59.632]  And you gotta love how Neil Bortz pushes a national sales tax, which is what the UN wants.
[02:48:00.332 --> 02:48:02.013]  Again, no, we don't need more taxes.
[02:48:02.033 --> 02:48:06.314]  See, they're gonna keep the income tax and give us his flat fair tax.
[02:48:06.354 --> 02:48:07.215]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:08.795 --> 02:48:10.276]  Yeah, I was at ground zero.
[02:48:11.624 --> 02:48:17.007]  Interviewing victims of 9-11 and this big guy walks over and starts poking me.
[02:48:17.327 --> 02:48:17.988]  It's online.
[02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:20.009]  That's Neil Bortz.
[02:48:20.589 --> 02:48:21.570]  Because I'm like 5'10".
[02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:28.134]  And he's like probably about 6'6".
[02:48:28.174 --> 02:48:28.954]  He's towering.
[02:48:28.974 --> 02:48:30.896]  You know, I love it when big guys think it intimidates you.
[02:48:31.136 --> 02:48:32.397]  All it makes me want to do is attack them.
[02:48:33.037 --> 02:48:35.839]  And they start hanging over you, getting in your face.
[02:48:39.335 --> 02:48:41.417]  And you're sitting there, and he starts cussing at me.
[02:48:42.818 --> 02:48:45.459]  I'm not going to repeat it here on air, obviously.
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:47.581]  And I said, why don't you come on and debate me?
[02:48:48.702 --> 02:48:51.103]  And he said, no, you've got to pay me money to debate you.
[02:48:51.123 --> 02:48:52.104]  You've got to pay me money.
[02:48:52.164 --> 02:48:53.245]  I'm all about money.
[02:48:53.305 --> 02:48:54.186]  I'm a conservative.
[02:48:54.686 --> 02:48:58.249]  No, what you are is a fake conservative whore for the New World Order.
[02:48:58.809 --> 02:49:04.073]  And look, it's not my job to sit here and attack Neil Borch and people, but I heard that guy six, seven, eight years ago.
[02:49:04.113 --> 02:49:05.394]  He's been on Austin a long time.
[02:49:07.782 --> 02:49:10.544]  Saying that there's no New World Order, no world government.
[02:49:12.466 --> 02:49:20.252]  And I heard him say I was a liar about Operation Northwoods, and he said it didn't exist when it was in ABC News, Baltimore Sun, and it's declassified.
[02:49:21.593 --> 02:49:23.174]  No, you're the liar, Mr. Bortz.
[02:49:25.335 --> 02:49:27.157]  Now, years later, he admitted it later.
[02:49:28.738 --> 02:49:30.039]  But I'm not the liar.
[02:49:30.079 --> 02:49:30.800]  Do I make mistakes?
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:31.500]  Sometimes, yes.
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.344]  You know, I was once on KTSA in San Antonio talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:43.502]  And it was one of the wear pair, the son, what, Trey wear?
[02:49:45.183 --> 02:49:50.607]  And he said, he said, Alex, he goes, I think you're a good person.
[02:49:50.727 --> 02:49:59.592]  He said, and I believe you're sincere, but you better hope you're right about 9-11, because you got God to answer to if you're up here saying the government did 9-11 and you're wrong.
[02:50:01.774 --> 02:50:05.356]  And I appreciated that, not criticism, but that honest challenge.
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:17.383]  Because when I sat back, I was in New York at the time, I was on a cell phone doing a Texas interview, I sat back and I reflected and I thought about it for a few days, and I thought, yeah, I feel good about what I've said and done.
[02:50:19.503 --> 02:50:20.264]  I've told the truth.
[02:50:20.284 --> 02:50:28.086]  I mean, no one can look at the evidence of 9-11 and say that that was guys from a cave in Afghanistan.
[02:50:28.126 --> 02:50:29.046]  Give me a break, folks.
[02:50:31.776 --> 02:50:33.437]  And I have to tell the truth.
[02:50:33.477 --> 02:50:34.939]  That's all I've got is my integrity.
[02:50:35.459 --> 02:50:36.500]  Does that mean I'm perfect?
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:36.780]  No.
[02:50:37.701 --> 02:50:39.342]  But I mean, I try to be a good person.
[02:50:39.422 --> 02:50:40.303]  I try to tell the truth.
[02:50:40.583 --> 02:50:41.424]  I try to be moral.
[02:50:41.844 --> 02:50:43.385]  I try to be upstanding.
[02:50:44.286 --> 02:50:47.548]  There's a lot of people out there think being evil and lying is cute.
[02:50:48.709 --> 02:50:50.070]  They think being evil is tough.
[02:50:53.313 --> 02:50:55.715]  And I can stand before God for what I've done.
[02:50:56.095 --> 02:50:56.876]  I'm proud of myself.
[02:50:58.257 --> 02:50:59.718]  Say no to government vaccination.
[02:51:01.484 --> 02:51:02.605]  Say no to chemicals.
[02:51:02.825 --> 02:51:04.627]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[02:51:04.767 --> 02:51:13.496]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:51:13.556 --> 02:51:18.822]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[02:51:18.982 --> 02:51:20.584]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[02:51:20.764 --> 02:51:28.172]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[02:51:28.252 --> 02:51:32.337]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[02:51:32.437 --> 02:51:34.960]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:40.043]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[02:51:59.258 --> 02:52:02.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:06.282]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:06.522 --> 02:52:07.943]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:08.658 --> 02:52:11.319]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:11.339 --> 02:52:17.540]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:22.761]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:22.902 --> 02:52:32.884]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:33.004 --> 02:52:35.125]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:35.365 --> 02:52:36.685]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:36.945 --> 02:52:39.226]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:39.406 --> 02:52:41.247]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:41.527 --> 02:52:46.348]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:46.669 --> 02:52:55.792]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:57.938 --> 02:53:00.961]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:53:01.322 --> 02:53:04.926]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[02:53:05.226 --> 02:53:08.690]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:15.657]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[02:53:19.454 --> 02:53:20.114]  We're good to go.

[02:53:51.203 --> 02:53:52.363]  Huge story at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:52.403 --> 02:53:52.963]  Exclusive lead
[02:54:11.585 --> 02:54:17.192]  Author admits deleting inconvenient opinions from IPCC report.
[02:54:19.694 --> 02:54:32.109]  That's a decent headline, dealing with Al Gore's fraud of inconvenient truth, but maybe the, we edit here on air, maybe the headline should be lead author admits deleting
[02:54:35.111 --> 02:54:39.193]  Scientific reports that man not changing weather from IPCC report.
[02:54:39.494 --> 02:54:40.554]  I guess that'd be too long.
[02:54:40.954 --> 02:54:41.655]  I mean this is big.
[02:54:41.695 --> 02:54:43.756]  This is as big as Climategate.
[02:54:44.736 --> 02:54:48.619]  The problem is you have one big explosion like that, this won't get as much attention.
[02:54:48.979 --> 02:54:50.620]  Unless people really try to get it out there to people.
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:52.541]  But this is really another big victory against them.
[02:54:54.582 --> 02:54:57.024]  And we've got links to the YouTube as long as it's up.
[02:54:57.204 --> 02:54:58.905]  I didn't post the YouTube of the TV show.
[02:54:59.245 --> 02:55:00.226]  I'm a consultant on it.
[02:55:00.866 --> 02:55:05.970]  And I don't know if the network would like that, but we certainly have links to it if you want to see it.
[02:55:06.210 --> 02:55:07.951]  It'll be re-airing on TruTV as well.
[02:55:08.591 --> 02:55:13.074]  But as long as that YouTube is up, and they tend to be leaving them up, so I guess it's okay.
[02:55:13.855 --> 02:55:14.295]  Who knows?
[02:55:17.097 --> 02:55:18.238]  I've talked to the producers of it.
[02:55:18.258 --> 02:55:20.099]  I don't talk to people over at the network.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:22.541]  That's up on...
[02:55:24.636 --> 02:55:29.037]  PrisonPlanet.com right now when the show ends or tonight if you missed the episode.
[02:55:29.057 --> 02:55:35.399]  You can check your TV guide for when it's going to be re-airing on TruTV or watch it via YouTube.
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:39.961]  We have it linked again up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:55:40.481 --> 02:55:46.443]  I checked it this morning and there were probably, I quit counting, there were over 50 different versions of the whole show on YouTube.
[02:55:48.348 --> 02:55:50.734]  It'll be like whack-a-mole if somebody does want to take it down.
[02:55:50.754 --> 02:55:51.857]  You should be able to find it.
[02:55:52.619 --> 02:55:56.689]  But certainly you want to watch the next Big Brother piece next Wednesday 10 p.m.
[02:55:59.074 --> 02:56:00.936]  That is going to be extremely informative.
[02:56:01.416 --> 02:56:12.886]  Speaking of underground material that Big Brother really doesn't want you to see, who the bankers are, what their master plan is, how the environmental movement is a eugenics movement meant to destroy your sovereignty and set up the New World Order.
[02:56:13.446 --> 02:56:22.874]  It's all covered in Fall of the Republic and until Christmas or until the t-shirts run out and they are running out.
[02:56:24.042 --> 02:56:33.385]  Now again, you can still get a free t-shirt because as the Obama Joker t-shirts run out, we've added a few other popular t-shirts in the sizes that have run out.
[02:56:34.705 --> 02:56:38.806]  So that you can get the free t-shirt with the Fall of the Republic DVD.
[02:56:40.007 --> 02:56:44.708]  And orders that come in today will ship out tomorrow, and most people will still get it before Christmas.
[02:56:45.308 --> 02:56:49.150]  Because they'll be here shipping Saturday, and then Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:52.311]  And then we're off Thursday and Friday here at the office.
[02:56:52.351 --> 02:56:53.551]  But the point is,
[02:56:54.858 --> 02:56:56.278]  You want to give somebody the gift of truth?
[02:56:56.399 --> 02:57:00.220]  You can, in the online shopping cart in the comment section, put a note.
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:02.781]  Hey Bob, I mailed you this film.
[02:57:02.801 --> 02:57:03.661]  I want you to watch it.
[02:57:04.081 --> 02:57:04.701]  From Terry.
[02:57:05.081 --> 02:57:05.942]  Or whatever your name is.
[02:57:08.222 --> 02:57:09.723]  Or hey, this is Carol, Bill.
[02:57:10.523 --> 02:57:11.844]  Or hey, Jenny, this is Carol.
[02:57:11.904 --> 02:57:15.705]  I want you to see this film, Fall of the Republic, to understand what's happening in the world right now.
[02:57:16.641 --> 02:57:21.547]  And then we will mail it to them if you want, or we can mail it to you and you can give it to them if they're locals.
[02:57:22.108 --> 02:57:26.093]  So get your orders in today for Fall of the Republic, Endgame, the Obama Deception.

[02:58:47.617 --> 02:58:52.783]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:58:52.923 --> 02:58:57.288]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:58:57.448 --> 02:58:59.310]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:58:59.731 --> 02:59:01.092]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:59:01.353 --> 02:59:02.394]  There is a solution.
[02:59:02.614 --> 02:59:10.658]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:59:53.036 --> 02:59:55.797]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:14.207 --> 03:00:19.831]  We are going to continue with open phones at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:19.851 --> 03:00:25.615]  I would hope for those already holding and those that call in, though, to be a little bit considerate of our guest.
[03:00:28.177 --> 03:00:32.240]  William F. Jasper, senior editor of the New American Magazine, investigative reporter.
[03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:36.863]  I learned a lot from him when I was in high school and college reading the New American.
[03:00:37.992 --> 03:00:41.714]  And of course Alex Newman, he's a freelance writer but also writes for the New American.
[03:00:42.035 --> 03:00:48.339]  They are together in Copenhagen, Denmark in the closing 48 hours of the climate summit.
[03:00:48.359 --> 03:00:51.801]  We just had Lord Monckton on in the first hour.
[03:00:51.861 --> 03:00:53.862]  He was beat up by a police officer today.
[03:00:54.803 --> 03:00:57.625]  The UN police and others are attacking accredited reporters.
[03:00:58.385 --> 03:00:59.826]  That have passes to get in.
[03:01:00.126 --> 03:01:01.027]  They're not letting them in.
[03:01:01.527 --> 03:01:02.628]  They're attacking reporters.
[03:01:02.688 --> 03:01:04.790]  I've seen countless videos that go to press conferences.
[03:01:05.170 --> 03:01:08.452]  You ask about ClimateGate, you are drug out, you are trudgeoned.
[03:01:10.353 --> 03:01:12.735]  We've got global government openly being announced.
[03:01:13.456 --> 03:01:24.924]  We've gone from 40 years ago, the John Birch Society and others being called kooks, loonies, nuts, for reading official UN plans of Armand Hammer and others for world government.
[03:01:25.703 --> 03:01:35.635]  And I really think they've miscalculated by denying it all these years and now going, oh yes, it's real.
[03:01:46.004 --> 03:01:49.486]  This has blown giant torpedo holes in their hull.
[03:01:50.347 --> 03:01:52.568]  And Climategate has blown a giant hole in them.
[03:01:52.909 --> 03:02:09.340]  And now, in the Jesse Ventura special that I consult for, last night, the lead author of the IPCC report, IPCC that works for the UN, and Maury Strong, admits they cut out the five areas of the report where their own scientists said humans are not affecting climate.
[03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:14.403]  So another giant admission by these people,
[03:02:16.462 --> 03:02:17.523]  This is just devastating.
[03:02:17.543 --> 03:02:18.524]  We're going to break in a moment.
[03:02:18.544 --> 03:02:21.386]  Long segment coming up, but let's go to William F. Jasper first.
[03:02:21.626 --> 03:02:32.954]  William, what is it like for you, for, I don't know, two decades or so, writing about the New World Order or longer, and being laughed at when you had all the source documents, now it's all right out in the open?
[03:02:34.716 --> 03:02:38.659]  Well, it is, Alex, but they're still openly denying it.
[03:02:38.679 --> 03:02:44.143]  When you bring things like this up in venues like here at Bella Center, where I am right now,
[03:02:45.081 --> 03:03:07.553]  Bella Center is the place where they're holding COP15, the Climate Summit, and right now Alex and I are standing here in the Media Center, which is where all the so-called journalists are gathered, several thousand, and we have banks and banks of tables of people filing stories all over the world.
[03:03:10.132 --> 03:03:11.453]  I don't think so.
[03:03:25.339 --> 03:03:27.179]  What do you call that psychologically?
[03:03:27.219 --> 03:03:33.240]  It's like they have a psychological compulsion or implanted idea, because for 20 years they said it didn't exist, or longer.
[03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:35.661]  Now that they admit it, they still can't report it.
[03:03:35.701 --> 03:03:49.263]  I mean, there's Schwarzenegger, there's Ban Ki-moon, they're all up there calling for planetary regimes, global government, and I've had national reporters here, five or six of them in the last month, and I play them clips of this and they say it doesn't exist.
[03:03:50.503 --> 03:03:54.524]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's a form of psychological
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:04:06.706]  Uh, schizophrenia or, uh, just an inability to self-censor themselves so that they will not think through, uh, what it is they're hearing and witnessing with their own eyes.
[03:04:07.266 --> 03:04:15.210]  Um, there have been, uh, almost, uh, nothing, uh, no people here that I've seen that have had a past about climate change.
[03:04:15.230 --> 03:04:17.971]  We tried today, Alex, uh, we got it on video.
[03:04:17.991 --> 03:04:20.032]  It's going to be going up, uh, pretty soon here.
[03:04:21.232 --> 03:04:24.354]  Uh, Alex was able to, uh, uh, corner
[03:04:25.346 --> 03:04:25.666]  Stay there!
[03:04:25.726 --> 03:04:30.228]  William F. Jasper, the editor of the New American Magazine.
[03:04:46.638 --> 03:04:54.985]  There in Copenhagen with his cohort, Alex Newman, he's going to break down what he's witnessed over there in the nest of globalists.
[03:04:55.025 --> 03:04:56.947]  He is in the heart of the disease.
[03:04:57.607 --> 03:05:01.851]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:02.151 --> 03:05:02.732]  Number one.
[03:05:03.052 --> 03:05:07.054]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:07.335 --> 03:05:11.897]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:12.237 --> 03:05:12.678]  It's true.
[03:05:12.978 --> 03:05:17.520]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:18.661 --> 03:05:21.943]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:25.986]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:26.967 --> 03:05:29.329]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:29.729 --> 03:05:33.952]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:34.192 --> 03:05:38.115]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:38.335 --> 03:05:43.099]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:05:57.981 --> 03:06:00.583]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:01.003 --> 03:06:05.967]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:06.328 --> 03:06:08.069]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:08.369 --> 03:06:13.193]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:13.373 --> 03:06:14.334]  How much do you want?
[03:06:14.554 --> 03:06:15.315]  When do you want it?
[03:06:15.695 --> 03:06:17.277]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:17.577 --> 03:06:18.397]  When will you need it?
[03:06:18.638 --> 03:06:20.719]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:20.839 --> 03:06:21.960]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:22.201 --> 03:06:23.542]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:23.722 --> 03:06:24.002]  If there's
[03:06:24.002 --> 03:06:26.085]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:06:26.245 --> 03:06:28.768]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:28.968 --> 03:06:32.172]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:32.552 --> 03:06:36.057]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:36.377 --> 03:06:37.378]  How much will you need?
[03:06:37.619 --> 03:06:38.219]  We don't know.
[03:06:38.500 --> 03:06:39.421]  How much do you want?
[03:06:39.621 --> 03:06:40.342]  All you can get.
[03:06:40.542 --> 03:06:41.243]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:41.623 --> 03:06:41.884]  I think.
[03:06:56.980 --> 03:07:02.147]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:07:02.287 --> 03:07:06.653]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:07:06.833 --> 03:07:08.676]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:07:09.096 --> 03:07:10.458]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:07:10.718 --> 03:07:11.780]  There is a solution.
[03:07:11.980 --> 03:07:20.006]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:07:20.406 --> 03:07:27.472]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:07:33.917 --> 03:07:39.481]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:07:58.957 --> 03:08:01.138]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:01.719 --> 03:08:04.581]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:05.441 --> 03:08:10.925]  William F. Jasper, senior editor of the New American Magazine, investigative reporter, author.
[03:08:12.310 --> 03:08:19.796]  He attended the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and exposed the global authoritarian agenda being proposed in the Planetary Environmental Regulation.
[03:08:20.536 --> 03:08:30.624]  You know, nobody deserves more credit exposing the fake green agenda to establish world government than the new American and chief among them, William F. Jasper.
[03:08:31.892 --> 03:08:41.722]  Who I ran into in 1999 at an urban warfare martial law takeover drill in Northern California or in Central California in Oakland.
[03:08:42.783 --> 03:08:46.227]  It was interesting running into him at that event.
[03:08:46.247 --> 03:08:50.591]  He's got Alex Newman who also writes as a freelancer for the New American with him.
[03:08:50.611 --> 03:08:51.352]  They're on the same phone.
[03:08:51.372 --> 03:08:52.233]  We'll go to him in a moment.
[03:08:52.713 --> 03:08:53.594]  But we were talking about
[03:08:54.495 --> 03:08:59.860]  How they're denying there's global government while they're announcing that there's global government.
[03:08:59.900 --> 03:09:02.282]  We have the treaty here.
[03:09:03.208 --> 03:09:07.251]  That actually says it's meant to shut down the third world and starve these people to death.
[03:09:07.611 --> 03:09:12.615]  They sold the third world as if it was some communistic experiment to give them free goodies.
[03:09:13.196 --> 03:09:18.280]  But just like Russians who believed Lenin, all they found out was they were going to slave camps.
[03:09:18.300 --> 03:09:22.283]  So let's talk about what you're witnessing there on the ground, what's behind this movement.
[03:09:22.563 --> 03:09:28.928]  Maury Strong, who you got to see in person, say in Rio de Janeiro, we want to destroy the industrial society.
[03:09:29.348 --> 03:09:32.390]  What their goals are, who they are, explain to people
[03:09:33.231 --> 03:09:35.572]  Who think that leftists and communists are grassroots?
[03:09:35.952 --> 03:09:37.293]  What's really behind that?
[03:09:37.873 --> 03:09:40.114]  And just break it down for us, William F. Jasper.
[03:09:41.434 --> 03:09:45.176]  Well, Alex, there's so many things that we see going on here.
[03:09:45.216 --> 03:09:52.719]  But one of the most striking things is that I've written about for many years, particularly since Rio de Janeiro.
[03:09:54.300 --> 03:09:59.282]  We're seeing now the culmination of an effort that was begun there
[03:10:00.017 --> 03:10:03.720]  We know the name now, NGO, Non-Governmental Organization.
[03:10:03.820 --> 03:10:09.565]  Back then, 17 and a half years ago in Rio, that was pretty much a newly invented term.
[03:10:10.085 --> 03:10:18.232]  But Rio was the first launch pad of the NGOs as a revolutionary parliamentary movement.
[03:10:18.993 --> 03:10:22.075]  They're really just UN spies that take over your local town?
[03:10:23.296 --> 03:10:25.838]  Well, yes, in all different kinds of areas.
[03:10:25.998 --> 03:10:28.000]  Of course, mostly with the Earth Summit.
[03:10:28.527 --> 03:10:33.950]  And with this one, we're talking about environmentalists, the so-called environmentalist organization.
[03:10:34.030 --> 03:10:43.576]  At least, that is the pretext, but they use the same concern for all things nature-full, the earth, the sky, the feathery, furry little creatures, etc.
[03:10:45.237 --> 03:10:50.941]  And, of course, many of the true believers, the foot soldiers out there, they do believe all this.
[03:10:50.961 --> 03:10:56.144]  But the people at the top, the Maurice Strongs, the David Rockefellers, the Stephen Rockefellers,
[03:10:57.754 --> 03:11:14.539]  George Soros, etc., who are funding all of these things and organizing and launching all these different groups, they have another agenda in mind, which is to use concern for the environment as a means of taking more and more control, control of our economy, control of all aspects of our lives.
[03:11:14.599 --> 03:11:23.502]  Well, in Rio de Janeiro, we had around 20,000 to 30,000 different NGO activists arrive there.
[03:11:23.922 --> 03:11:25.743]  And what was different there in
[03:11:27.236 --> 03:11:32.346]  Real from today is, in Rio all of these activists arrived there.
[03:11:32.426 --> 03:11:38.699]  This was part of the rent-a-mob that the UN had brought there with all of its influence and money.
[03:11:39.529 --> 03:11:40.449]  That makes the U.N.
[03:11:40.489 --> 03:11:41.150]  look moderate.
[03:11:41.170 --> 03:11:41.610]  The U.N.
[03:11:41.650 --> 03:11:47.751]  is like, we're only socialists that want to tax you at 20%, and then all the communists waving red flags, literally.
[03:11:47.771 --> 03:11:50.192]  In fact, we'll roll some of that video in the background.
[03:11:51.012 --> 03:11:57.074]  They're calling for total government, destruction of all capitalism, so that allows the U.N.
[03:11:57.094 --> 03:11:57.974]  to look more moderate.
[03:11:58.855 --> 03:12:00.595]  Well, that's one of the functions.
[03:12:00.635 --> 03:12:03.736]  You certainly have a lot of NGOs performing that function.
[03:12:03.776 --> 03:12:06.817]  Then you have other NGOs that take the more moderate
[03:12:07.256 --> 03:12:08.297]  Socialist position.
[03:12:08.337 --> 03:12:09.778]  That is, we're very reasonable.
[03:12:09.818 --> 03:12:14.401]  All we're asking for is what is fair for the, in this case, Mother Earth, etc.
[03:12:15.182 --> 03:12:18.264]  And so you have a push-pull effect going on there.
[03:12:18.544 --> 03:12:20.505]  But in Rio, they were outside.
[03:12:20.805 --> 03:12:27.850]  They had their own village where they agitated from and carried on street theater and parades, etc.
[03:12:28.511 --> 03:12:30.792]  And then the UN was interacting with them.
[03:12:30.832 --> 03:12:34.615]  Maury Strong and Gorbachev and Castro would go down to the village and whatnot.
[03:12:34.935 --> 03:12:35.716]  But since then,
[03:12:36.398 --> 03:12:49.252]  In 95 at Cairo and then 98 at Rome for the International Criminal Court and all of the UN summits since then, both environmental and human rights and all of the other summits.
[03:12:49.682 --> 03:12:58.929]  And how this works is the UN can then point at their employees and say, these are stakeholders, that's a key word when you hear that, for sustainability, what do the people want?
[03:12:58.949 --> 03:13:00.010]  We want world communism!
[03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:01.551]  And they go, hmm, that's what the people want.
[03:13:17.376 --> 03:13:17.796]  Exactly.
[03:13:18.137 --> 03:13:21.378]  This is the charade known as civil society.
[03:13:22.319 --> 03:13:25.401]  Every one of these people is called a stakeholder.
[03:13:25.421 --> 03:13:30.463]  That is, they hold some kind of stake in all of these goings-on here.
[03:13:30.804 --> 03:13:37.687]  And they are supposedly representative of some sector of humanity or society.
[03:13:37.707 --> 03:13:39.789]  But of course, they're not elected by anyone.
[03:13:39.829 --> 03:13:41.449]  They are not accountable to anyone.
[03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:44.511]  Their funding is coming from the various governments.
[03:13:45.152 --> 03:13:45.852]  The big funders
[03:13:46.454 --> 03:13:51.376]  Uh, start out being the foundations, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Soros Foundation, etc.
[03:13:51.896 --> 03:13:57.298]  And then they quickly, they've taught these people how to then get on the government bill so that we're paying for it directly.
[03:13:57.418 --> 03:14:12.404]  That the UN, the EU, all the various EU individual governments, the US foreign aid government, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, are funding these thousands of NGO organizations to the tune of really billions of dollars a year.
[03:14:12.424 --> 03:14:15.966]  So they're using our tax dollars, the other taxpayers' dollars from around the world,
[03:14:16.403 --> 03:14:16.523]  Yes.
[03:14:35.251 --> 03:14:55.376]  Let me interrupt you, again, William F. Jasper, the editor of the New American Magazine, on with us, from Copenhagen, Denmark, the last 48 hours of this global governance establishing event, because I want to get to, not just the structure, but also, are they successful this year, in your eyes, or is this a failure, and your take on Climategate, and your overall view on things.
[03:14:55.916 --> 03:14:56.976]  But take Lord Monckton.
[03:14:57.016 --> 03:15:03.158]  We interviewed Christopher Monckton last hour, the first hour of the show, and he talked about how
[03:15:04.298 --> 03:15:05.919]  He is a House of Lords member.
[03:15:06.399 --> 03:15:09.061]  So he had passes in, and the U.N.
[03:15:09.081 --> 03:15:10.161]  said don't let him in.
[03:15:10.182 --> 03:15:14.344]  And when he, they started roughing him up so he agreed to leave.
[03:15:14.364 --> 03:15:19.047]  When he turned around, the cop knocked him over, busted his head and leg open.
[03:15:19.667 --> 03:15:19.867]  Well, right.
[03:15:19.887 --> 03:15:20.967]  See, I didn't even know about that.
[03:15:20.987 --> 03:15:22.788]  He was supposed to be coming here.
[03:15:22.848 --> 03:15:28.630]  We were going to interview him right outside the media center, which is inside the larger Bella Center here, where all this is taking place.
[03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:30.530]  And we were waiting for him.
[03:15:50.523 --> 03:15:54.125]  His wife ended up calling saying that he had tried to get in, but he couldn't get in.
[03:15:54.825 --> 03:16:01.709]  And that was the same with Mark Marano, who has a G.O.
[03:16:01.749 --> 03:16:02.469]  He's accredited.
[03:16:02.509 --> 03:16:03.690]  He was supposed to have passes.
[03:16:03.730 --> 03:16:04.570]  They wouldn't allow him in.
[03:16:05.031 --> 03:16:09.453]  Even today, Senator Inhofe came here, a Senator from Oklahoma.
[03:16:09.493 --> 03:16:11.374]  He's the lead one in the U.S.
[03:16:11.434 --> 03:16:13.235]  Congress opposing all of this.
[03:16:13.435 --> 03:16:17.377]  And here he's a senior member of Congress.
[03:16:17.417 --> 03:16:19.178]  He's the vice chairman of the
[03:16:21.204 --> 03:16:32.213]  He's in the top 10 Republican leaders in the United States.
[03:16:32.514 --> 03:16:33.414]  A powerful U.S.
[03:16:33.454 --> 03:16:33.795]  Senator.
[03:16:34.055 --> 03:16:36.457]  Are you about to tell me he wasn't allowed in?
[03:16:37.458 --> 03:16:43.663]  He was allowed in, but they wouldn't give him a room to, I think you're Greenpeace teams of yours,
[03:16:44.376 --> 03:16:50.980]  Uh, all of the rest of the environmentalist groups, they have rooms, they give official presentations, they're giving great big panels and everything.
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:53.101]  They wouldn't allow him to do that.
[03:16:53.362 --> 03:17:08.771]  He had to come in here, give a, uh, we couldn't even, he had to stand on the stairs outside and give his short speech, and most of us couldn't even get out there, get him because they put up special security today.
[03:17:09.586 --> 03:17:17.852]  So they basically stuck Senator Inhofe in a free speech zone?
[03:17:17.892 --> 03:17:18.152]  True.
[03:17:18.473 --> 03:17:24.017]  And he was only going to be here for a couple of weeks because he had votes in the Senate.
[03:17:24.097 --> 03:17:29.541]  So he arrived here, and the very limited time that he had here, he couldn't even do anything.
[03:17:29.581 --> 03:17:30.521]  He just gave a statement.
[03:17:30.881 --> 03:17:35.145]  And then I talked to his assistant, his chief of staff.
[03:17:36.343 --> 03:17:36.724]  All right.
[03:17:52.979 --> 03:18:01.904]  Can you believe that they beat up Monckton and then there's all these videos?
[03:18:03.264 --> 03:18:04.805]  I was completely unaware of that.
[03:18:04.825 --> 03:18:16.191]  That is just incredible because here yesterday, they had literally thousands of these NGO rag muffins in here, mostly high school and college kids.
[03:18:16.539 --> 03:18:18.260]  They're just here on a lark.
[03:18:18.360 --> 03:18:20.201]  Yes, they're all passionate and everything.
[03:18:21.441 --> 03:18:31.726]  But they allowed them to come in and actually stage demonstrations, and they had us sit down in the middle of the thoroughfare there, blocking the way, holding up their signs.
[03:18:32.046 --> 03:18:32.586]  That was fine.
[03:18:32.646 --> 03:18:33.466]  They let them.
[03:18:33.746 --> 03:18:36.808]  And all the media rushed to give them billions of dollars.
[03:18:36.828 --> 03:18:41.290]  Here you have all of the press from all over the world here, all the cameras and whatnot.
[03:18:41.610 --> 03:18:44.431]  So here are these kids who wouldn't even give their full names.
[03:18:45.098 --> 03:18:53.081]  Uh, they would just sit down there and they say, hold up signs saying, we, we're not leaving until we get an agreement that is fair, balanced and ambitious.
[03:18:53.922 --> 03:18:58.584]  And so somebody put these signs in their hands, told these kids to sit down there.
[03:18:58.944 --> 03:18:59.424]  They do it.
[03:18:59.464 --> 03:19:00.785]  They mouse these platitudes.
[03:19:00.905 --> 03:19:01.985]  They don't know what they're talking about.
[03:19:02.025 --> 03:19:03.566]  They can't give you any details about it.
[03:19:04.736 --> 03:19:08.257]  And they're giving billions of dollars worth of free publicity all over the world.
[03:19:08.297 --> 03:19:10.237]  Yeah, that's a key point.
[03:19:10.337 --> 03:19:11.797]  I've been to some of these events, too.
[03:19:12.137 --> 03:19:17.158]  And the rent-a-mobs, when you really get a kid by themselves, a minder will run over and say, don't talk to them.
[03:19:17.179 --> 03:19:18.939]  And you'll find out, hey, I was just paid $100.
[03:19:19.039 --> 03:19:21.799]  In fact, I believe I have that on video.
[03:19:21.819 --> 03:19:25.380]  We've been uploading the video because I interviewed them.
[03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:26.880]  I had them on video.
[03:19:27.180 --> 03:19:29.621]  But they would turn around when I would ask a question.
[03:19:30.231 --> 03:19:37.773]  Yeah, stay there.
[03:19:37.793 --> 03:19:48.315]  Let's talk more about that and the overall agenda and talk to your colleague as well, Alex Newman, who's with William F. Jasper, senior editor of the New American Magazine.
[03:19:48.895 --> 03:19:50.535]  Nice enough to join us from Copenhagen.
[03:19:50.995 --> 03:19:52.516]  We may end up keeping him most of the hour.
[03:19:52.576 --> 03:19:57.177]  They're busy guys, though, because I want to get into the overall agenda as well.
[03:19:57.497 --> 03:19:57.877]  Stay with us.
[03:19:58.703 --> 03:20:02.965]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[03:20:03.305 --> 03:20:10.848]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[03:20:11.108 --> 03:20:25.895]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.
[03:20:26.195 --> 03:20:30.817]  Order the Berkey light system today, complete with two black Berkey elements for only two hundred and nine dollars.
[03:20:30.877 --> 03:20:35.500]  And the Berkey guy will include three sport Berkey water bottles and ship everything to you free of charge.
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:36.180]  That's right.
[03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:40.042]  Three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping and eighty seven dollar value.
[03:20:40.122 --> 03:20:42.383]  Yours free, but only for a limited time.
[03:20:42.664 --> 03:20:43.724]  Just call the Berkey guy at 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53.
[03:20:44.024 --> 03:20:44.344]  Now to order.
[03:20:44.364 --> 03:20:45.345]  That's 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 or order online now at
[03:20:57.890 --> 03:21:01.776]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[03:21:02.016 --> 03:21:06.163]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[03:21:06.283 --> 03:21:07.665]  You get less for your money.
[03:21:07.865 --> 03:21:13.694]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[03:21:13.894 --> 03:21:14.274]  We're good.
[03:21:40.299 --> 03:21:42.660]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:42.680 --> 03:21:44.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:44.340 --> 03:21:45.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:08.743 --> 03:22:11.404]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:11.424 --> 03:22:17.646]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:17.806 --> 03:22:22.848]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:23.008 --> 03:22:26.149]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:26.270 --> 03:22:32.972]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:33.112 --> 03:22:35.213]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:35.454 --> 03:22:36.794]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:37.034 --> 03:22:39.316]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:39.496 --> 03:22:41.337]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:41.637 --> 03:22:46.440]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:46.781 --> 03:22:51.563]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:51.764 --> 03:22:55.886]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:04.255 --> 03:23:15.280]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:23:16.001 --> 03:23:18.542]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[03:23:19.102 --> 03:23:26.106]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:23:26.306 --> 03:23:32.929]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[03:23:33.496 --> 03:23:36.698]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[03:23:37.379 --> 03:23:40.742]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[03:23:41.282 --> 03:23:45.945]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[03:23:46.446 --> 03:23:49.608]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[03:24:21.270 --> 03:24:26.014]  All right, we are back.
[03:24:26.094 --> 03:24:29.176]  William F. Jasper, Senior Editor of The New American, is our guest.
[03:24:29.257 --> 03:24:33.460]  Alex Newman, they're on the same phone, standing by another investigative reporter.
[03:24:34.921 --> 03:24:37.203]  They travel there together, or they're working together there.
[03:24:38.664 --> 03:24:43.727]  Look, Alex Newman is now there with us.
[03:24:43.908 --> 03:24:44.088]  Alex?
[03:24:46.509 --> 03:24:56.037]  Give us your take on how the conference is going, kind of your snapshot of what's happening, and how successful are the globalists at establishing their one world government at this event?
[03:24:57.618 --> 03:25:11.649]  Well, so far they keep having all these little spats where they're pretending that the conference is dead and they're stalled and all these different things because some group of dictators isn't going to get the amount of wealth redistribution that they want from the so-called rich countries.
[03:25:12.130 --> 03:25:19.274]  So there's this big theater that the talks keep getting stalled and so forth, but overall it seems that they're making progress.
[03:25:20.615 --> 03:25:32.522]  China had been making a stink earlier because not enough people wanted to give money to the developing countries, so they weren't happy with any of the texts that were coming out of that, and they were thinking of offering a counter-proposal.
[03:25:33.222 --> 03:25:35.804]  But so far they seem to be advancing.
[03:25:35.824 --> 03:25:38.285]  There's been a couple of the draft texts released.
[03:25:38.945 --> 03:25:39.686]  I was reporting on
[03:25:40.387 --> 03:25:52.377]  One that was called the Danish text that was released some time ago, which was talking about taxing airline travel, various shipping operations, and so then you would have the UN with its own revenue stream.
[03:25:53.217 --> 03:26:00.163]  And its own enforcement, its own travel authority, 2% tax right off the top of all GDPs, a true global government.
[03:26:01.064 --> 03:26:03.446]  Do the latest agreements look like the Danish text?
[03:26:05.055 --> 03:26:15.463]  They've been taking things out and adding things in, but it seems that the basic framework is that's what they're going for, to have some kind of taxation mechanism where they can raise their own money.
[03:26:15.483 --> 03:26:17.304]  Okay, that is bad news.
[03:26:17.464 --> 03:26:25.791]  So, and that's what Lord Monckton was saying, that it looks like they're just acting like they're playing possum, but really it looks like they may get it.
[03:26:27.512 --> 03:26:32.576]  Yes, where it looks like it's moving towards now, everybody's talking about that, oh, the whole world is
[03:26:33.226 --> 03:26:38.128]  Depending on this moment right now, and we need to make one final push to get a tough agreement through.
[03:26:38.148 --> 03:26:40.970]  So that's basically the atmosphere around here.
[03:26:41.010 --> 03:26:44.731]  And if you talk to just about anybody around here, that's kind of where they're standing.
[03:26:45.031 --> 03:26:46.772]  They want to see some tough new growth.
[03:26:46.792 --> 03:26:50.554]  And you've got a bunch of bought-off third-world countries under IMF and World Bank control.
[03:26:51.254 --> 03:26:55.256]  And so it doesn't matter if their populations don't want it, they're still going to go along with it.
[03:26:55.496 --> 03:26:58.097]  You've got Obama that's going to sign on to it.
[03:26:58.117 --> 03:26:59.478]  I mean, is there any way to stop this?
[03:27:00.762 --> 03:27:03.785]  Well, Communist China has some interesting ideas about it.
[03:27:03.825 --> 03:27:07.688]  They want to have some kind of population control mechanisms and these kind of things.
[03:27:08.068 --> 03:27:15.855]  And so the latest word around here earlier this afternoon was that they were threatening to try to derail the talks and end it with a proposal.
[03:27:16.296 --> 03:27:18.798]  But so far we just have to see.
[03:27:20.137 --> 03:27:21.658]  Well, hold on, hold on.
[03:27:21.678 --> 03:27:27.380]  We've got a reporter with The New American there, Alex Newman, and I want to go back after the break to Mr. Jasper.
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:28.480]  This is big news here.
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:30.081]  Give us the meat of what you're saying.
[03:27:30.401 --> 03:27:36.223]  The Chinese are threatening to derail things if a global one-child policy isn't signed on to?
[03:27:37.543 --> 03:27:39.244]  Well, I'm not sure about all of that.
[03:27:39.444 --> 03:27:47.747]  Well, that's what they called for on Monday, but you're saying... That's one of the things that they've been hoping to have is some kind of global population control.
[03:27:48.803 --> 03:27:49.784]  Holy mackerel!
[03:27:49.984 --> 03:27:51.565]  You're saying that may be added in?
[03:27:51.665 --> 03:27:53.606]  I mean, they're actually talking about getting that in there?
[03:27:54.787 --> 03:28:08.055]  Well, I don't know about that, but we talked to the Congressman today, Congressman Markey, who wrote the bill with Congressman Waxman, the climate change bill that came out of the House of Representatives, and we asked them about, you know, why are we negotiating with China?
[03:28:08.075 --> 03:28:13.438]  They're talking about global population control and, you know, things that are totally repugnant to the U.S.
[03:28:13.478 --> 03:28:14.799]  Constitution and to the U.S.
[03:28:14.839 --> 03:28:15.299]  way of life.
[03:28:16.753 --> 03:28:23.156]  His answer was, oh, everybody has to pursue their own strategies to tackle the climate issue and this kind of stuff.
[03:28:23.716 --> 03:28:28.138]  So it doesn't look like there's going to be a lot of opposition to it, at least from this group.
[03:28:28.158 --> 03:28:30.359]  Well, China owns most of our debt.
[03:28:30.539 --> 03:28:33.640]  I mean, they're the biggest owner of our debt, and we're told they're the new superpower.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:36.241]  They really are the model for this new world order.
[03:28:37.162 --> 03:28:40.423]  Yeah, they have a lot of influence there, and everybody's been talking about it.
[03:28:40.748 --> 03:28:42.889]  China, you know, how can we get China to cooperate?
[03:28:42.929 --> 03:28:49.073]  Oh, we all need to bow down to China's demands because if they walk out then we're not going to get the global agreement that we need.
[03:28:49.133 --> 03:28:53.536]  So we need to figure out how to work with China so we can get this accomplished.
[03:28:53.556 --> 03:28:58.139]  That's definitely not good news if your listeners know anything about the Chinese government.
[03:28:59.020 --> 03:29:03.142]  So since the Danish text, have you gotten any other of the latest versions?
[03:29:04.883 --> 03:29:09.046]  I haven't read through any of the actual drafts, but there's been hints flying around
[03:29:09.488 --> 03:29:11.790]  But it's been a lot of just tweaking with the numbers.
[03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:17.313]  You know, should we cap carbon dioxide emissions by 45% or should it be 30%?
[03:29:18.114 --> 03:29:22.077]  And should the funding mechanism be $100 billion or $150 billion?
[03:29:22.517 --> 03:29:26.460]  So they're debating whether to put 5 bullets in our heart or 10 bullets?
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:28.081]  Pretty much, yeah.
[03:29:28.101 --> 03:29:30.042]  That's what it looks like it's going towards.
[03:29:30.062 --> 03:29:33.224]  Are they going to beat us in the head with a baseball bat 20 times or 40 times?
[03:29:33.244 --> 03:29:33.504]  You know.
[03:29:35.222 --> 03:29:36.603]  At a certain point, what does it matter?
[03:29:37.063 --> 03:29:38.565]  Stay there, Alex Newman.
[03:29:38.585 --> 03:29:40.846]  We're gonna come back and I got some questions for William F. Jasper.
[03:29:40.886 --> 03:29:42.868]  Then I'll go back to you, take a few calls.
[03:29:43.208 --> 03:29:44.969]  They join us from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[03:29:45.270 --> 03:29:46.711]  We'll also get their websites.
[03:29:48.172 --> 03:29:49.052]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.553 --> 03:29:51.174]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.095 --> 03:29:54.757]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.588 --> 03:30:04.433]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:04.573 --> 03:30:06.535]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:30:06.655 --> 03:30:08.776]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:08.897 --> 03:30:10.418]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:30:10.558 --> 03:30:14.901]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:30:15.041 --> 03:30:17.323]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:30:17.583 --> 03:30:23.384]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.

[03:30:28.385 --> 03:30:31.126]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:30:31.226 --> 03:30:33.846]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:33.946 --> 03:30:41.108]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:30:41.408 --> 03:30:45.093]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.

[03:30:45.394 --> 03:30:47.056]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:30:57.335 --> 03:31:01.557]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:31:01.877 --> 03:31:05.938]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:31:06.219 --> 03:31:11.621]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:31:11.961 --> 03:31:12.401]  It's true.
[03:31:12.701 --> 03:31:17.263]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:31:17.563 --> 03:31:18.104]  Number 3.
[03:31:18.404 --> 03:31:21.688]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:31:21.989 --> 03:31:25.733]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:31:25.893 --> 03:31:26.454]  Number 4.
[03:31:26.694 --> 03:31:29.077]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:31:29.458 --> 03:31:32.862]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:31:33.142 --> 03:31:33.363]  Number 5.
[03:31:33.923 --> 03:31:37.845]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:31:38.066 --> 03:31:42.828]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:31:43.129 --> 03:31:47.151]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:31:47.291 --> 03:31:48.872]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:31:49.072 --> 03:31:53.675]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:31:58.991 --> 03:32:02.612]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:32:02.952 --> 03:32:11.074]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:32:11.795 --> 03:32:15.836]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:32:16.436 --> 03:32:27.259]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:32:27.879 --> 03:32:36.881]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:32:37.401 --> 03:32:42.442]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:32:42.823 --> 03:32:50.004]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:32:50.304 --> 03:32:53.045]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:33:01.055 --> 03:33:03.538]  A lot of people worry that what you're going to wind up with is hash.
[03:33:03.578 --> 03:33:08.904]  There's even some Democrats saying now we've got a bill that's so compromised that it's not worth signing.
[03:33:09.644 --> 03:33:10.605]  If we don't pass it.
[03:33:11.328 --> 03:33:12.169]  Here's the guarantee.
[03:33:12.849 --> 03:33:14.030]  Your premiums will go up.
[03:33:14.330 --> 03:33:16.492]  Your employers are going to load up more costs on you.
[03:33:16.992 --> 03:33:24.618]  Potentially they're going to drop your coverage because they just can't afford an increase of 25-30% in terms of the cost of providing health care to employees each and every year.
[03:33:25.378 --> 03:33:32.364]  And the federal government will go bankrupt because Medicare and Medicaid are on a trajectory that are unsustainable.
[03:33:32.784 --> 03:33:34.825]  And this actually provides us the best chance
[03:33:35.766 --> 03:33:42.051]  ...of starting to bend the cost curve on the government expenditures in Medicare and Medicaid.
[03:33:42.432 --> 03:33:43.873]  Talk about deception!
[03:33:44.714 --> 03:33:52.220]  They're not just trying to grab all resources and tax carbon dioxide involved in all human and animal and industrial activity.
[03:33:54.082 --> 03:33:58.604]  Remember, they said they had to have the trillions of dollars with the banker bailout or we'd have a depression.
[03:33:58.985 --> 03:34:01.486]  Then they said, oh, we're going to keep the money and not tell you where it went.
[03:34:02.006 --> 03:34:08.530]  And now we're going to have a bankrupt government if we don't raise all the taxes and cut your Medicare and Medicaid.
[03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:17.375]  See, once the bankers get you dependent, they then start increasing the taxes and cutting back the domestication feed, the chicken feed.
[03:34:17.395 --> 03:34:18.855]  They're done feeding the hog.
[03:34:19.296 --> 03:34:21.397]  You've been fattened up, now they're going to eat you.
[03:34:22.492 --> 03:34:30.062]  And going back to William F. Jasper of the New American Magazine and Alex Newman also writes for the New American Magazine in Copenhagen.
[03:34:31.183 --> 03:34:35.268]  We just got the bad news from Alex and I respect his view but I want to get your view.
[03:34:36.450 --> 03:34:37.451]  Monckton is saying
[03:34:38.558 --> 03:34:52.647]  They're not going to call it a treaty, so they don't have to ratify it in different nations, but that it's going to bring the bureaucracy in to start all the taxes, but that they won't get everything they asked for, but that they're having somewhat of a success here.
[03:34:54.068 --> 03:34:56.049]  He was talking about the Danish text and other things.
[03:34:57.010 --> 03:35:01.032]  What is the sense of the research you're doing there on the ground?
[03:35:01.232 --> 03:35:05.215]  Is this a victory for the globalists, for the Rothschilds, for the Rockefellers?
[03:35:06.547 --> 03:35:09.529]  Well, Alex, I can go by my past experience.
[03:35:09.629 --> 03:35:11.190]  I've been at enough of these summits.
[03:35:12.871 --> 03:35:14.472]  It's the same at every one of them.
[03:35:15.172 --> 03:35:23.517]  You have all of this ambition and everything coming into it, and they've got all the leaders of the world, and already as they start the summit, there's bickering over text.
[03:35:23.697 --> 03:35:25.678]  You have all these different bracketed texts.
[03:35:25.738 --> 03:35:27.339]  You'll hear them talking about bracketed texts.
[03:35:27.359 --> 03:35:34.183]  That's because different parties to the treaty have all different kinds of ideas about
[03:35:34.719 --> 03:35:39.663]  And of course, all the reparations don't go to starving Africans for the deadly carbon dioxide.
[03:35:39.743 --> 03:35:41.945]  No, no, it all goes to Maury Strong.
[03:36:04.058 --> 03:36:04.618]  Right.
[03:36:04.858 --> 03:36:10.262]  It always goes to the dictators and the bankers and those who are running the show.
[03:36:10.603 --> 03:36:21.511]  And so what happens at these summits is you have all of this chaos and confusion going on and hassling and haggling back and forth.
[03:36:22.031 --> 03:36:25.974]  And then midway through it, they say, oh, it's a crisis there.
[03:36:27.375 --> 03:36:28.496]  We're not going to get this through.
[03:36:28.536 --> 03:36:30.237]  It was the same thing in Rome.
[03:36:31.485 --> 03:36:31.845]  Bring it up.
[03:36:41.909 --> 03:36:50.773]  So what they do is they start putting on the pressure and they start bringing in all the big guns at that time, Bill Clinton and all the other... So that's, I mean, it's a shake and bake operation.
[03:36:50.793 --> 03:36:52.513]  It's like making pancakes out of a box.
[03:36:53.054 --> 03:36:59.056]  They use reverse psychology of getting everybody there, building up expectations, then saying, too bad we failed.
[03:36:59.376 --> 03:37:03.798]  So then all the smaller parties want to sign on to feel like they were part of history.
[03:37:04.599 --> 03:37:05.599]  Right.
[03:37:05.659 --> 03:37:06.319]  Just watch here.
[03:37:06.339 --> 03:37:10.301]  They're going to be saying, you'll be seeing this, they'll say, the world is watching.
[03:37:10.737 --> 03:37:11.798]  We have to do this.
[03:37:11.898 --> 03:37:13.159]  The world is calling on us.
[03:37:13.579 --> 03:37:15.620]  We've let this go for all these years.
[03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:17.221]  Kyoto and all of this stuff.
[03:37:17.241 --> 03:37:18.422]  It's Rio in 92.
[03:37:19.002 --> 03:37:19.662]  It's time.
[03:37:19.702 --> 03:37:20.323]  This is the time.
[03:37:20.363 --> 03:37:21.784]  That's what they've been saying here, you know?
[03:37:22.344 --> 03:37:23.805]  So they start putting the pressure on.
[03:37:24.085 --> 03:37:26.927]  That's the pressure that you can see.
[03:37:27.027 --> 03:37:35.652]  Behind the scenes, they're doing all kinds of bribing and arm-twisting about all these countries that owe debt and all these that want to get access to new debt.
[03:37:35.892 --> 03:37:38.554]  So they're buying off and bribing all the politicians and whatnot.
[03:37:39.042 --> 03:37:45.344]  So by the end of the day on Friday or early Saturday morning, I believe they're going to announce an agreement.
[03:37:45.624 --> 03:37:50.906]  It's not going to be what they want, and of course it's not something that would pass muster in the U.S.
[03:37:50.966 --> 03:37:53.346]  Senate, even as bad as the Senate is right now.
[03:37:53.687 --> 03:38:04.470]  But what they want to do, what they know they have to do, is get an agreement that will qualify as what they call soft law.
[03:38:05.423 --> 03:38:12.409]  I first started writing about this back in 1990, and then after the Earth Summit, because they started announcing that it's called cough law.
[03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:13.991]  It's not really a treaty.
[03:38:14.031 --> 03:38:32.627]  It doesn't really have teeth in it, but the teeth are hidden way back there, and pretty soon we'll start adding institutions to it, and all of the judges and the attorneys and the politicians will keep talking about it, how we have this commitment and we have this obligation, and pretty soon it will become customary law.
[03:38:33.191 --> 03:38:33.433]  We're good.
[03:38:36.821 --> 03:38:37.221]  on to it
[03:39:07.021 --> 03:39:08.342]  It's completely subversive.
[03:39:08.602 --> 03:39:10.924]  I mean, he's taken an oath to the U.S.
[03:39:10.984 --> 03:39:21.710]  Constitution as well as to the California Constitution, and he's totally subverting the whole constitutional process and violating his oath.
[03:39:22.411 --> 03:39:29.255]  It's completely contrary to our whole system and ethic of government.
[03:39:29.375 --> 03:39:35.219]  So, yeah, what they're doing is, in this whole process,
[03:39:35.598 --> 03:39:38.280]  Just by creating these stakeholders in civil society.
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:41.283]  It's really a form of the old Soviet, the Soviet Union.
[03:39:41.543 --> 03:39:57.296]  They had these Soviets, that's where they got it from, these circles, these Soviets, where they would bring, the communists would bring together the doctors and the lawyers and the students and the intellectuals, and none of these people really represented all the rest of the
[03:39:59.637 --> 03:40:02.499]  It's gangs!
[03:40:02.619 --> 03:40:07.503]  It's gangs, they decide to give power, who literally operate as their agents.
[03:40:08.304 --> 03:40:11.066]  Yes, and so that's what they're doing here.
[03:40:11.327 --> 03:40:14.209]  It's a total farce, only it's a very deadly one.
[03:40:15.130 --> 03:40:21.936]  And, you know, there's all of this, what's at stake here, is of course not just the trillions of dollars.
[03:40:22.516 --> 03:40:26.760]  I wrote a story recently, you know, we're talking about here at the conference,
[03:40:27.259 --> 03:40:27.560]  Of course.
[03:40:43.153 --> 03:40:46.834]  Ban Ki-moon said $20 trillion.
[03:40:47.074 --> 03:40:56.396]  And by the way, I'm sure you've seen this, but Ban Ki-moon gave an LA Times article interview and he said, we will enforce global governance on you whether you like it or not.
[03:40:57.036 --> 03:40:58.856]  These guys are really getting arrogant.
[03:41:01.197 --> 03:41:01.577]  Totally.
[03:41:01.857 --> 03:41:11.959]  And as everything we've discussed here shows, they don't believe they have to allow anyone to voice any other opinion, have any other representation here.
[03:41:13.072 --> 03:41:14.112]  We're good to go.
[03:41:38.695 --> 03:41:40.056]  I haven't found anybody else here.
[03:41:40.076 --> 03:41:44.920]  I have found a couple of others who were able to slide by and get in here, but not very many.
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:48.382]  Everybody else is part of a choir to bring on the global government.
[03:41:50.684 --> 03:41:54.806]  No question about any of the ClimateGate.
[03:41:55.167 --> 03:41:56.808]  Alex will get into you with the ClimateGate.
[03:41:56.828 --> 03:41:58.869]  He's been working on a couple of stories on that.
[03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:02.732]  But as you well know,
[03:42:03.543 --> 03:42:07.065]  What we're talking about here is unprecedented in terms of the grasp of power.
[03:42:07.926 --> 03:42:12.329]  Here they're saying they want to regulate the air you breathe, every breath you take, every move you make.
[03:42:12.369 --> 03:42:17.072]  And that's part of one of the things that I brought back from Rio de Janeiro.
[03:42:17.472 --> 03:42:20.073]  I think I was the first one to ever write about it or speak.
[03:42:20.093 --> 03:42:23.095]  I went on a speaking tour and I held it up as I went around the country.
[03:42:23.455 --> 03:42:23.856]  Agenda 21.
[03:42:24.016 --> 03:42:32.161]  I mean, it's a huge 800, 2000 page, depending on the version, a global master plan of the United Nations for
[03:42:33.384 --> 03:42:41.108]  The 21st century, and it says in there, and I quoted it verbatim, this is a plan that's going to affect every person on Earth.
[03:42:41.148 --> 03:42:44.049]  It's going to affect every aspect of your life.
[03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:53.514]  We have plans here for businessmen and students and doctors and lawyers and farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and steel workers.
[03:42:53.614 --> 03:42:57.036]  They list every possible person and occupation.
[03:42:57.076 --> 03:43:01.078]  They say this is going to affect every part of the planet, from deserts to tundra to
[03:43:03.758 --> 03:43:14.225]  Well, I mean, that is the issue now, is that before it was global government, but they were covert.
[03:43:14.285 --> 03:43:20.210]  Now they come out and say, we run the whole planet, humans are bad, we want to bankrupt industrial societies.
[03:43:21.230 --> 03:43:23.631]  And if you try to come to our meetings, we beat you up.
[03:43:24.011 --> 03:43:26.012]  I mean, these are open tyrants.
[03:43:26.092 --> 03:43:27.312]  They know they're tyrants.
[03:43:28.012 --> 03:43:30.653]  They've got, you know, 18-year-old rent-a-mobs.
[03:43:30.693 --> 03:43:34.534]  They give $100 a day to run around and, you know, act foolish.
[03:43:35.055 --> 03:43:36.015]  But here it is.
[03:43:36.075 --> 03:43:38.876]  But, William F. Jasper, in your decades of fighting these people,
[03:43:39.736 --> 03:43:45.520]  Do you see us beginning to gain momentum, the pendulum beginning to slow in its swing towards tyranny?
[03:43:45.760 --> 03:43:54.146]  That's why they're trying to come out in the open now and force it and finish their agenda because major cracks in the foundation of their system are appearing?
[03:43:54.486 --> 03:43:55.607]  Or are you more pessimistic?
[03:43:59.288 --> 03:44:17.640]  I'm optimistic in that, and I think what we've seen in the last couple of months, verified by the Grassmussen poll and the Pew poll and the CBS poll, showing the plummeting support for any kind of climate change legislation.
[03:44:18.001 --> 03:44:28.848]  The belief in AGW anthropogenic global warming as a crisis, all of that has been crashing down faster than our great scientist Al Gore's credibility.
[03:44:31.786 --> 03:44:38.728]  And that's because people still have more common sense than the elitists.
[03:44:38.788 --> 03:44:40.908]  Plus the system is so discredited now.
[03:44:40.928 --> 03:44:49.510]  I mean, it doesn't matter what party it is, where it is in the world, people are finally getting that healthy mistrust of government.
[03:44:50.290 --> 03:44:54.811]  Right, and it has to increase a great deal more because they recognize that people
[03:44:55.413 --> 03:44:56.794]  I don't think so.
[03:45:19.188 --> 03:45:26.652]  Environmental charade that, you know, it could melt like an ice cream cone here in Al Gore's movie.
[03:45:26.752 --> 03:45:31.375]  So they're really concerned about that, and they have a right to be.
[03:45:31.475 --> 03:45:43.401]  Even before Climategate, most of the polls were already showing this collapse of belief in the crisis, in the apocalypse that they're claiming is coming.
[03:45:43.761 --> 03:45:48.304]  And you and I both know, look, they're saying they want to re-engineer all of society.
[03:45:48.857 --> 03:45:59.367]  You have guys like one of the big gurus of global warming, Clive Hamilton, professor from Australia, and he says that this is a time where it calls for emergency measures.
[03:45:59.707 --> 03:46:03.070]  We have to talk about suspending democratic processes.
[03:46:03.331 --> 03:46:09.577]  You have guys like George Monbiot say we need to issue a ration card for every person on the planet.
[03:46:10.579 --> 03:46:12.500]  Uh, only so much, uh, CO2.
[03:46:13.100 --> 03:46:25.767]  And, uh, uh, you can... And you have John P. Holdren writing a textbook about putting steroids in the water, and now Fox News is calling for putting lithium in the water to make the public more well-behaved.
[03:46:25.807 --> 03:46:31.790]  I mean, we are living in the twilight zone, and they can normalize insanity if we don't say no.
[03:46:31.851 --> 03:46:33.031]  Look at the Nazi culture.
[03:46:33.411 --> 03:46:34.712]  Look at the Aztec culture.
[03:46:34.752 --> 03:46:36.273]  So, there, there, it's encouraging.
[03:46:36.633 --> 03:46:44.857]  That people are waking up and saying no to this, in spite of the fact that we have the media so heavily controlled by people who are promoting this.
[03:46:46.078 --> 03:46:51.941]  But it's galloping at us very quickly, and so we've got to accelerate the wake-up process.
[03:46:52.161 --> 03:46:57.363]  Well guys, we're almost out of time, and I wanted to have a... Let me turn you back over to Alex so he can... But before you do that, William.
[03:46:57.624 --> 03:46:58.104]  William, you there?
[03:46:59.153 --> 03:46:59.453]  I'm here.
[03:46:59.874 --> 03:47:03.258]  We already have some of them available on the newamerican.com or at jps.org.
[03:47:18.611 --> 03:47:28.479]  Either one of those, and we've been doing it, running back and forth, shooting photos, doing interviews, uploading to it, so I haven't even had a chance to even check to see how many of them are up there yet, but a number of them are.
[03:47:28.679 --> 03:47:44.251]  You can see, for instance, our one on the anti-nuclear, one that went up today, it's called NGO Demonstrators, No to Coal, No to Oil, No to Nuclear, and you can see some of the random offsets here.
[03:47:44.893 --> 03:47:46.935]  They wouldn't allow monks in there.
[03:47:47.175 --> 03:47:51.359]  Many of these qualified PhDs and scientists want to, but they allow these folks to come in.
[03:47:51.759 --> 03:48:00.066]  And if you go on the website that I show you there, you see they have outright communist parties with communist flags hammered and sickles as part of their coalition.
[03:48:00.106 --> 03:48:03.569]  They're allowed to come in here, and the good guys aren't.
[03:48:04.736 --> 03:48:05.296]  Absolutely.
[03:48:05.316 --> 03:48:07.537]  Well, good talking to you and we'll talk to you again soon.
[03:48:07.557 --> 03:48:10.157]  Let me talk to Alex now.
[03:48:10.297 --> 03:48:12.298]  Alex, we've only got a few minutes left in this segment.
[03:48:12.318 --> 03:48:13.878]  I'll turn you over to Alex.
[03:48:13.938 --> 03:48:14.498]  Thanks so much.
[03:48:14.518 --> 03:48:14.779]  Thank you.
[03:48:14.799 --> 03:48:15.279]  You bet.
[03:48:16.379 --> 03:48:16.779]  Thank you.
[03:48:17.999 --> 03:48:18.720]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:48:19.220 --> 03:48:19.500]  Good.
[03:48:19.860 --> 03:48:25.401]  Go ahead and in the last couple minutes we have, any other key points you want to relay to the audience?
[03:48:25.681 --> 03:48:28.182]  Alex Newman from the Global Government Summit.
[03:48:29.542 --> 03:48:39.204]  Yeah, well, the one thing that I've found is the most incredible is you have this 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is Climategate, of course, and just about everybody here at least knows what it is.
[03:48:39.604 --> 03:48:44.865]  Some of them don't know exactly what it's about because they've already dismissed it because it contradicts the global warming phase.
[03:48:45.366 --> 03:48:47.426]  But it's just incredible.
[03:48:47.446 --> 03:48:54.007]  I've been talking to just about everybody I meet about it, journalists in particular, and that's where I've been getting the most interesting answers.
[03:48:54.808 --> 03:48:56.308]  I've met one journalist out of
[03:48:56.707 --> 03:49:01.431]  Dozens and dozens that I've spoken with who's filed a story related to Climategate.
[03:49:01.471 --> 03:49:09.076]  She interviewed one of the IPCC people on Switzerland's national radio about Climategate.
[03:49:09.096 --> 03:49:11.758]  And of course, he just went on there and said, oh, it's no big deal.
[03:49:11.799 --> 03:49:14.681]  The science is settled and that's just a side issue, a distraction.
[03:49:15.221 --> 03:49:17.723]  But I also talked to some of the Congress people that were here.
[03:49:17.783 --> 03:49:18.904]  Nancy Pelosi was here.
[03:49:19.044 --> 03:49:24.208]  She answered one of my questions, and then as soon as I asked her about Climategate, she turned away and pretended she didn't hear it.
[03:49:25.945 --> 03:49:37.033]  I asked Charlie Rangel, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, powerful congressman, about climate gain, and he looked at me a bit puzzled, and he said, no, no, no, we're just here to support the process, and of course the science is settled.
[03:49:38.914 --> 03:49:47.920]  So it's just been across the board, everybody you talk to just about, just uses the same mantra over and over again, the science is settled, you can't ask questions.
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:55.085]  And it's even come out within the last two days now, the Russian Institute of Economic Analysis, I believe it's called, has been
[03:49:55.529 --> 03:50:04.093]  Calling doubt on the figures used by the Hadley office at the Met office in England, which is supposed to be the other reputable scientific place to prove global warming.
[03:50:04.673 --> 03:50:12.457]  And it turns out now they've used, I think, only 25% of the weather stations that were provided to them from Russia's territory.
[03:50:12.937 --> 03:50:17.119]  And, of course, they used the ones that showed their hypothesis to be correct that there's warming.
[03:50:17.699 --> 03:50:23.302]  And they ignored the other 75%, which either didn't show significant warming or didn't show warming at all.
[03:50:23.993 --> 03:50:31.658]  So you have just this horrible farce of a science, a pretend science, and nobody is willing to talk about it.
[03:50:31.978 --> 03:50:36.621]  So it's just, like I said, the elephant in the room, and nobody wants to address it.
[03:50:36.721 --> 03:50:40.423]  So hopefully, with shows like yours, we can just keep getting the word out, you know?
[03:50:40.863 --> 03:50:47.928]  We are exposing these frauds, and if we stand up and rebuke them and decide that we're supposed to be involved in society for good, we can stop them.
[03:50:48.508 --> 03:50:51.050]  Alex Newman from Copenhagen, thank you for spending time with us.
[03:50:51.070 --> 03:50:51.690]  Godspeed.
[03:50:52.451 --> 03:50:53.091]  Thank you, Alex, you too.
[03:50:54.005 --> 03:50:55.346]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:50:55.406 --> 03:50:56.146]  Key information.
[03:50:56.166 --> 03:50:56.606]  Stay with us.
[03:50:58.067 --> 03:51:04.910]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:51:05.050 --> 03:51:06.291]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:51:06.311 --> 03:51:06.991]  It's very real.
[03:51:07.131 --> 03:51:09.272]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:51:09.372 --> 03:51:10.893]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:51:11.033 --> 03:51:15.375]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:51:15.515 --> 03:51:17.897]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:51:18.077 --> 03:51:22.699]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:51:22.779 --> 03:51:23.880]  For your home or business.
[03:51:24.080 --> 03:51:28.802]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:51:28.862 --> 03:51:31.604]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:51:31.704 --> 03:51:34.326]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:51:34.426 --> 03:51:41.590]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters and ultraviolet lights.
[03:51:41.890 --> 03:51:45.572]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:51:45.612 --> 03:51:45.832]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:51:59.221 --> 03:52:02.844]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:03.244 --> 03:52:06.247]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:06.487 --> 03:52:07.908]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:08.607 --> 03:52:11.268]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:11.288 --> 03:52:17.490]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:22.712]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:23.212 --> 03:52:32.835]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:32.955 --> 03:52:35.076]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:35.316 --> 03:52:36.636]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:36.896 --> 03:52:39.177]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:39.357 --> 03:52:41.218]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:41.478 --> 03:52:46.299]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:46.620 --> 03:52:51.421]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:51.641 --> 03:52:55.743]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:59.867 --> 03:53:00.988]  This is not a drill.
[03:53:01.088 --> 03:53:03.069]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:53:03.589 --> 03:53:05.190]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:53:05.490 --> 03:53:12.613]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:53:12.713 --> 03:53:17.056]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[03:53:17.096 --> 03:53:27.401]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:53:27.841 --> 03:53:28.301]  We're good to go.
[03:53:52.909 --> 03:53:57.372]  We're past the point of talking.
[03:53:57.933 --> 03:54:07.439]  We know historically that the global governance agenda to these issues is very hard to try and, with all the best intentions, it's very hard to actually activate.
[03:54:07.939 --> 03:54:08.880]  We're seeing that right now.
[03:54:08.900 --> 03:54:13.903]  We're seeing a lot of fragmentation going on in Copenhagen, a lot of different agendas pulling in different directions.
[03:54:13.963 --> 03:54:22.249]  And I think what we really need to see is people on the ground starting to actually act upon the low-hanging fruit and start to try and move on the solutions that we have at hand.
[03:54:24.629 --> 03:54:30.450]  In case you missed it, Colonel Jackson is coming for you Rothschild.
[03:54:30.470 --> 03:54:31.411]  Monday through Friday,
[03:54:51.454 --> 03:54:52.194]  From 11 a.m.
[03:54:52.214 --> 03:54:52.834]  to 3 p.m.
[03:54:52.895 --> 03:54:55.255]  Central, we're here live back on Sunday.
[03:54:55.275 --> 03:54:58.116]  It's 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:58.196 --> 03:55:00.117]  And I wasn't live last Sunday.
[03:55:00.157 --> 03:55:01.938]  I will be live this Sunday.
[03:55:01.958 --> 03:55:04.879]  And the Sunday after that.
[03:55:04.899 --> 03:55:10.881]  I meant to get the calls.
[03:55:10.901 --> 03:55:13.581]  We just ran out of time with those two reporters with so much info.
[03:55:13.601 --> 03:55:15.922]  Tomorrow we've got other big guests joining us.
[03:55:16.122 --> 03:55:17.843]  And same thing on Sunday into next week.
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:21.601]  Here's some of the crazy news I've got in front of me.
[03:55:21.862 --> 03:55:23.062]  Now, we already knew this.
[03:55:23.442 --> 03:55:24.963]  We told you this a year and a half ago.
[03:55:25.744 --> 03:55:27.485]  Had Tarpoli on about it, but here it is.
[03:55:27.525 --> 03:55:28.245]  London Telegraph.
[03:55:28.265 --> 03:55:29.486]  Give me a close shot of this, guys.
[03:55:30.267 --> 03:55:32.408]  Mumbai suspects is U.S.
[03:55:32.448 --> 03:55:34.029]  double agent, India claims.
[03:55:34.809 --> 03:55:37.771]  And it turned out that all the major shooters were double agents.
[03:55:38.492 --> 03:55:42.454]  And the few people they grabbed were on LSD and drugged out.
[03:55:42.494 --> 03:55:43.555]  It was all staged.
[03:55:43.915 --> 03:55:47.237]  They dressed up a few dead bodies of people they shot and said that they were the Muslims.
[03:55:48.428 --> 03:55:53.332]  And governments, most of the time, terror attacks, the big ones that get promoted are like this.
[03:55:54.112 --> 03:55:55.833]  There are real terror attacks going on.
[03:55:56.834 --> 03:55:59.316]  If a terror attack's real, you don't see the media hype it.
[03:56:00.957 --> 03:56:07.462]  I mean, in the 60s and 70s, there were close to a thousand bombings in the U.S., and it was hardly ever on the news because they were real.
[03:56:08.563 --> 03:56:09.904]  They were mainly communist bombings.
[03:56:11.805 --> 03:56:12.465]  But, um...
[03:56:13.723 --> 03:56:18.465]  An American man charged with plotting the attacks on Mumbai was a double agent for both the United States and Al-Qaeda terror group.
[03:56:19.345 --> 03:56:20.445]  Indian officials have said.
[03:56:20.505 --> 03:56:22.606]  Okay.
[03:56:22.646 --> 03:56:23.206]  Here's another one.
[03:56:23.266 --> 03:56:26.307]  Russia Today, that's directly from the Russian government then.
[03:56:26.867 --> 03:56:29.928]  It's their government-funded English-speaking channel.
[03:56:30.968 --> 03:56:34.249]  Russia says new military doctrine, more threat, smaller risk.
[03:56:35.210 --> 03:56:42.032]  And they say that since the United States and NATO, NATO changed its doctrine a few years ago to first strike.
[03:56:43.194 --> 03:56:45.155]  And NATO, Russia said, please don't do that.
[03:56:45.855 --> 03:56:50.056]  And NATO has said, but our media is going to say that Russia is the only one doing this.
[03:56:50.117 --> 03:56:55.939]  No, NATO said we will strike Russia first and then did 888 trying to test Russia.
[03:56:57.579 --> 03:57:02.921]  And again, the bankers, it's not the Americans or Europe versus the Russians.
[03:57:03.001 --> 03:57:10.444]  It's the bankers angry that Russia kicked out some oligarchs to have their own corrupt system, but it's theirs.
[03:57:13.214 --> 03:57:20.961]  Russia Military will have more options to use nuclear arms and can see potential threats to the country's security when the new military doctrine comes into force.
[03:57:21.401 --> 03:57:26.025]  The document, which is expected to be put into place before the year's end, will replace the version adopted in 2000.
[03:57:26.065 --> 03:57:31.069]  The draft document was revealed to the media this week, reports the Gazeta newspaper.
[03:57:31.950 --> 03:57:33.752]  The Secretary of the Russian Security Council
[03:57:35.109 --> 03:57:42.454]  Announced that Moscow will consider nuclear weapons as a possible option in more situations than it used to, which is what the Pentagon said they're going to do.
[03:57:43.095 --> 03:57:46.477]  A preemptive nuclear strike with weapons will be a possible scenario.
[03:57:46.497 --> 03:57:54.263]  And they go on to say if Western Europe gets involved in any of their border areas, or gets in any of their business, they're going to nuke us.
[03:57:56.924 --> 03:57:57.905]  The bankers don't care.
[03:57:58.165 --> 03:58:00.007]  Hell, they'll set off a nuke and say Russia did it.
[03:58:00.087 --> 03:58:01.568]  I mean, they all got underground bunkers.
[03:58:02.674 --> 03:58:04.975]  So the globalists are devilish.
[03:58:05.516 --> 03:58:09.238]  They want their world government, and they're going to get it by hook or by crook.
[03:58:10.118 --> 03:58:11.659]  Copenhagen Climate Conference.
[03:58:11.719 --> 03:58:16.702]  Arnold Schwarzenegger calls for planetary transformation through global governance.
[03:58:19.943 --> 03:58:22.004]  I mean, just get out of here, you usurper.
[03:58:22.545 --> 03:58:24.646]  I know you dream of being a Hitler, like you said, but...
[03:58:25.742 --> 03:58:27.143]  You got the wrong country, pal.
[03:58:28.003 --> 03:58:31.145]  Hey, you still can get this in time for Christmas, folks.
[03:58:31.425 --> 03:58:33.686]  Free t-shirts at Infowars.com.

[03:58:36.127 --> 03:58:37.128]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:37.148 --> 03:58:38.128]  Lord Monckton coming up.
[03:58:38.208 --> 03:58:44.071]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:44.111 --> 03:58:45.992]  Lord Monckton coming up right now.
[03:58:46.012 --> 03:58:47.733]  Right at the start of the show.
[03:58:47.773 --> 03:58:48.533]  Retransmission.
[03:58:48.914 --> 03:58:52.575]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:58:52.936 --> 03:58:53.756]  This is our last...
