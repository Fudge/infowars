[00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:06.408]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:08.170]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.933]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.515]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:12.416]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:17.263]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:21.308]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.981]  It is the final day of November 2009.
[00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:37.026]  Climategate is continuing to explode across newspaper front pages across the globe.
[00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:42.689]  Television is attempting predominantly to spin it or not even cover it.
[00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:49.473]  We've had a horrible mass shooting execution style of four police officers in a suburb of Seattle, Washington.
[00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:56.525]  And I've been noticing a trend here with these police shootings.
[00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:04.762]  In fact, I'm going to be breaking that down, an angle that no one has covered, that no one has noticed.
[00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:10.525]  But I'm sure the police have noticed it, but they don't want to be politically incorrect and talk about it.
[00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.427]  So we're going to be discussing that as well today.
[00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:24.613]  Huge developments in the Dubai default with that state finance development fund of 14 billion pounds, sending shockwaves through global
[00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:29.395]  Markets, and we're also going to have open phones today.
[00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:30.355]  No guests today, though.
[00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:41.683]  I'm going to play some clips of my live Charlie Sheen interview yesterday, and we're also going to play some clips from Lord Christopher Monckton's incredible interview live here on Friday.
[00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:55.272]  We'll be playing short clips of that throughout the radio broadcast today, and I'm going to play, once we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting with the radio show, I'm going to play in full the winner of the 20 Minutes with the President contest.
[00:01:56.052 --> 00:01:59.454]  And I may be announcing 2nd and 3rd place today or tomorrow.
[00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:04.296]  To be honest with you, for two weeks I've been looking, because I'm judging 2nd and 3rd place.
[00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:07.037]  Charlie judged 1st place, which was the easy part.
[00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:08.198]  And I'm still juggling.
[00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:09.538]  I'm still trying to decide.
[00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.779]  It's heart-rending.
[00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:21.644]  And I'm chiming in with some of my staff who they think should win because I'm really having trouble being decisive here because there's so many good ones that should get 2nd or 3rd place.
[00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:23.965]  So that is coming up today as well.
[00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:39.216]  When Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth, former member, of course, of Metallica, was on with us a month and a half ago, he talked about how he named his new album, Endgame, off of my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:54.159]  It wasn't Dave's first visit with us here on air, but he really opened up, and it was an amazing interview that's been written about in a lot of big music publications, and he said, when I come to Texas in December, I'd like to hook up.
[00:02:55.317 --> 00:03:04.788]  And then Craig Sadler, one of the producers here in the office, pointed out last week, he said, you know, next week is when Dave Mustaine's in town.
[00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:08.012]  And I scrambled, sent an email, but they were already on the road.
[00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:11.656]  And we hadn't heard back from them since Friday when we first thought about this.
[00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:21.534]  More emails this morning, and I said, you know what, I'm just going to call, because I've got Dave's cell phone and his assistant's cell phone, but I called his assistant's cell phone.
[00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.356]  They're in Corpus Christi.
[00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:25.638]  This is right before airtime.
[00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.299]  And he goes, here, let me just wake Dave up.
[00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.700]  And I'm like, no, no!
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.842]  So he wakes Dave Mustaine up.
[00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:33.805]  Dave gets on the phone and says, yeah.
[00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:35.666]  Yeah, call me back later today after I wake up.
[00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:38.948]  It should be good to do an interview in Dallas.
[00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:44.869]  I got to check the schedule, count on that, but if not, I'll come on via the phone in the next few days.
[00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.390]  But I do want to go get some barbecue with you.
[00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.250]  He's such a great guy.
[00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.251]  He goes, I'm going back to sleep.
[00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:50.631]  Call me later, buddy.
[00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:54.212]  So we're probably going to get a sit-down interview with Dave Mustaine.
[00:03:54.212 --> 00:04:02.535]  That means I've got to get in a car tomorrow or Wednesday and hightail it up to Big D. They also drive through the night.
[00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.558]  From San Antonio up I-35 to Dallas.
[00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:13.121]  They'll be doing that, what, Tuesday evening.
[00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.202]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:16.543]  But look for a video interview.
[00:04:16.543 --> 00:04:20.825]  Sit down with good old Alejandro Jones and Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.
[00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.445]  Uh, coming up for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.427]  Very, very excited about that.
[00:04:27.427 --> 00:04:30.488]  There's just so many, so many balls in the air here.
[00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:43.514]  How to keep track of all of them is mind-boggling sometimes, but good job to Craig Sadler for reminding me about that, because it's never too late, I guess, as long as you're not too late.
[00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:49.641]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to break down the news and take your phone calls.
[00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.603]  It's wide open phones today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:58.009]  We're going to take first-time callers, though.
[00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:58.789]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.789 --> 00:04:59.190]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:05.649]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:10.195]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:12.458]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.100]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.122]  There is a solution.
[00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:23.764]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:07.318]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:08.599]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:09.419]  It's very real.
[00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.661]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.302]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:07:00.097 --> 00:07:04.659]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:05.560]  Number one.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.001]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:09.842]  Number two.
[00:07:09.842 --> 00:07:14.744]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.744 --> 00:07:15.485]  It's true.
[00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:20.047]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:21.168]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:24.771]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:28.674]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.674 --> 00:07:29.475]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:32.237]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:35.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.721]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:40.864]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.864 --> 00:07:45.628]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:50.070]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:08:13.418 --> 00:08:32.625]  And put him in control Watch him become a god Watch people's heads unroll Unroll
[00:08:58.483 --> 00:09:00.884]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:01.744]  to 3 p.m.
[00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:04.224]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:04.224 --> 00:09:08.285]  We are here live.
[00:09:08.285 --> 00:09:09.266]  It's metal.
[00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:10.426]  Brain corrodes.
[00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:14.740]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.242]  Eastern.
[00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:21.903]  Before the head explodes.
[00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:24.164]  World government is here.
[00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:49.853]  The battle against the globalists has now begun.
[00:09:49.853 --> 00:09:57.376]  The awakening is accelerating.
[00:09:57.376 --> 00:10:04.380]  The population of the planet is rising to meet the threat of the New World Order.
[00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:16.095]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:19.056]  I can get into the latest ClimateGate, huge developments.
[00:10:19.056 --> 00:10:28.020]  I can get into the terrible murder execution style of four police officers in Washington State in a suburb of Seattle.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.042]  The financial information, it's all of great import.
[00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:35.824]  But I know listeners are chomping at the bit to talk about the Charlie Sheen live interview yesterday.
[00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:40.802]  I know listeners are chomping at the bit to talk about the Ventura interview.
[00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:46.247]  People are chomping at the bit to discuss the Lord Monckton interview live Friday for over an hour.
[00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:53.714]  Power-packed info calling for Al Gore's arrest and the complete abolishment of the United Nations.
[00:10:53.714 --> 00:10:59.660]  I know listeners are chomping at the bit to talk about the Dubai default of 14 billion pounds.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.883]  Just to begin with, the plunging stock markets.
[00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:08.200]  But first, we will take your phone calls.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.242]  I will tell you this.
[00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:20.509]  I noticed a trend immediately yesterday when doing an hour or so of research on the police shootings.
[00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:25.512]  And I said shootings because there's police shootings going on all over the country.
[00:11:25.512 --> 00:11:28.935]  A lot of police are being killed.
[00:11:28.935 --> 00:11:31.116]  And killed in large numbers at one time.
[00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:37.778]  And I noticed something immediately in this trend that no one dare point out.
[00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:43.960]  Well, we point out the truth no matter where it leads us.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.501]  We let the chips fall where they may.
[00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:51.022]  We play the hand that reality deals us.
[00:11:52.523 --> 00:11:55.126]  And so coming up later in the hour, I'm going to be breaking that down.
[00:11:55.126 --> 00:12:04.277]  They do have the individual surrounded in the neighborhood, the main suspect, and we're going to be breaking that down coming up.
[00:12:04.277 --> 00:12:11.085]  Maurice Clemons is the main suspect, they're saying, and may have been wounded.
[00:12:11.085 --> 00:12:12.266]  That's how they were able to track him.
[00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:15.812]  So that is coming up.
[00:12:15.812 --> 00:12:19.454]  And just giant developments on the climate gate front.
[00:12:19.454 --> 00:12:29.858]  Now seven days away from the kickoff of Copenhagen, the open founding, complete public announcement of the world government.
[00:12:29.858 --> 00:12:32.779]  The coming out party of these ghouls.
[00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:35.300]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.501]  No guest today.
[00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:39.182]  Have a lot of very informative
[00:12:40.595 --> 00:12:42.376]  Groundbreaking interviews coming up this week.
[00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:46.638]  I will just leave it at that for everyone.
[00:12:46.638 --> 00:12:50.480]  The toll-free number to join us, and I want to take first-time calls at least in this first hour.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.501]  A lot of people say they can never get in.
[00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:55.042]  When you hear a caller hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:55.122]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:55.122 --> 00:12:55.222]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:56.863]  We will get you up and on the air.
[00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:09.959]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:11.741]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:12.902]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:13:12.902 --> 00:13:14.423]  Appreciate everything you do.
[00:13:14.423 --> 00:13:15.905]  You bet, bro.
[00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:18.667]  Hey, kind of a two-part kind of question.
[00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:22.290]  One about the climate gate, one about the economy.
[00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:32.900]  Do you think when Obama will sign the Copenhagen Treaty, on account of all the emails and whatnot that have come out, and as for the economy question,
[00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:46.673]  Do you think that they're just basically propping the economy up to get through the holiday to drain all the rest of the blood out of the slaves before they pull the rug out from under us, so to speak?
[00:13:46.673 --> 00:13:48.854]  Say that again?
[00:13:48.854 --> 00:14:02.582]  Do you think that the powers that be are basically inflating the stock market, keeping things afloat the best they can with their lives right now, until after the Christmas holiday and everybody spends every last cent they have?
[00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.153]  Just to, you know, drain the more blood out of us.
[00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:26.931]  And certainly, the real economy has between a 20 and a 22 percent unemployment rate.
[00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:29.472]  Even CNBC says it's over 17 percent.
[00:14:29.472 --> 00:14:32.873]  The White House says 10.2.
[00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:35.013]  But over 20 is depressionary.
[00:14:35.013 --> 00:14:43.775]  So the real economy is just spiraling downward in a death rattle towards the bottomless abyss, while the banks
[00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:50.900]  Register record profits off the crises they engineered and the global warming takeover tax that they wrote.
[00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:57.551]  And so, yes, I agree with you that they want to get their expansion of the Afghan war announced.
[00:14:57.551 --> 00:15:01.014]  They want to get another banker bailout rammed through.
[00:15:01.014 --> 00:15:11.521]  They want to get more of their NORTHCOM paramilitary police force in place before they really drop the hammer and announce that we're officially in a depression.
[00:15:11.521 --> 00:15:18.186]  They're already hinting at that by saying a double-dip recession, which there's no such thing as a double-dip recession.
[00:15:19.141 --> 00:15:19.281]  We're
[00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.195]  The Copenhagen Treaty and everything would kind of coincide with that, you know, with new currency and
[00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.012]  And all of that... The new currency is going to be cashless.
[00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:13.694]  It's a bank-to-bank system where the banks just announced they just issued their own fiat cashless system above the government's.
[00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:15.974]  So that would basically just be between the banks?
[00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:21.735]  It wouldn't be... Yes, but they've got a global standardization system where you're going to thumbprint and face scan.
[00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:22.816]  It's already going on.
[00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:26.456]  Most people just aren't aware of it, to buy and sell.
[00:16:26.456 --> 00:16:29.217]  So we'll still have our regional and national currencies.
[00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:37.595]  And they'll be even private corporate currencies being issued, but they'll all be registered and run to the same grid.
[00:16:37.595 --> 00:16:39.617]  Wow, I wonder how they'll keep track of all that.
[00:16:39.617 --> 00:16:40.879]  I'm sure they got their way though, huh?
[00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:42.360]  Computers!
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.922]  Heh, yeah.
[00:16:43.922 --> 00:16:45.044]  Just to hold us down more.
[00:16:46.383 --> 00:16:48.364]  That's the name of the game.
[00:16:48.364 --> 00:16:49.085]  Thank you, sir.
[00:16:49.085 --> 00:16:52.207]  They want to bankrupt us so they can social engineer us.
[00:16:52.207 --> 00:16:53.068]  That's their own words.
[00:16:53.068 --> 00:16:56.690]  They want us fully bankrupted by design.
[00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.473]  That is Maurice Strong and the heads of the UN all on record.
[00:17:00.473 --> 00:17:01.974]  They are eugenicists.
[00:17:01.974 --> 00:17:12.342]  And if you're a new listener and you don't know what eugenics is and you don't know what social engineering is, you better find out fast because that's what makes the world go round under this system.
[00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:16.429]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Texas.
[00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:18.209]  Sean, you're on the air.
[00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.511]  Hey Alex, man, you're awesome.
[00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:22.532]  Been listening to you for about two years now.
[00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:26.774]  Thought I'd never call you, but I'm glad to be on the show.
[00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:30.556]  My thing is, I was looking at CNN, I just got up about 30 minutes ago.
[00:17:31.172 --> 00:17:43.661]  Now we're looking at CNN, they were talking about Obama with Afghanistan, he's going to Afghanistan, so now like 35,000 troops, 5,000 troops from NATO, and then 30,000 of our troops, and he's reaching out to other world leaders.
[00:17:44.673 --> 00:17:45.273]  That's right.
[00:17:45.273 --> 00:18:02.686]  In fact, I have a Russia Today newscast where Russia warms to the NATO alliance and admits they're supplying hundreds of helicopters, hundreds and hundreds of armored vehicles, and hundreds and hundreds now reaching into the thousands of advisors, former
[00:18:04.963 --> 00:18:14.172]  KGB, former Spitznats, Special Forces, helping NATO, which means Russia's been let in on a cut of the opium cash.
[00:18:14.172 --> 00:18:15.673]  This is just thoroughly disgusting.
[00:18:15.673 --> 00:18:19.877]  340,000 coalition slash NATO slash US slash Russian slash
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.420]  I think?
[00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:47.416]  The Raw Numbers.
[00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:18.118]  By distracting in the last 10 months saying he was going to decide on whether or not to send more US troops, he's already sent 40,000 troops in smaller increments since he got into office.
[00:19:18.118 --> 00:19:19.179]  Now he's saying 30,000 to 40,000 more.
[00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:22.965]  Another quick question.
[00:19:22.965 --> 00:19:25.407]  You were talking about the currency.
[00:19:25.407 --> 00:19:27.129]  When is Romero going to be implemented?
[00:19:44.264 --> 00:19:45.945]  Let me break that down when we get back, Sean.
[00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:47.246]  I appreciate your call.
[00:19:47.246 --> 00:19:50.209]  Then Brandon, Eddie, Greg, and many others.

[00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.971]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:03.812]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.812 --> 00:21:04.152]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.152 --> 00:21:09.194]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.194 --> 00:21:10.815]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.815 --> 00:21:11.575]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.575 --> 00:21:11.976]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:13.076]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.076 --> 00:21:16.038]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.038 --> 00:21:19.920]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.781]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:25.684]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.265]  I'm adding Startpage to my browser.
[00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:27.545]  Right!
[00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:30.869]  Go to Startpage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.869 --> 00:21:32.811]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.811 --> 00:21:36.234]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.638 --> 00:21:40.439]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:07.008]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[00:22:07.008 --> 00:22:11.949]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[00:22:11.949 --> 00:22:16.030]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.371]  Let's put this another way.
[00:22:17.371 --> 00:22:22.732]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:25.633]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:28.274]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[00:22:28.274 --> 00:22:29.654]  You can possess it in your hand.
[00:22:29.994 --> 00:22:31.254]  You can take it with you.
[00:22:31.254 --> 00:22:32.735]  Gold is real money.
[00:22:32.735 --> 00:22:34.096]  Gold is honest money.
[00:22:34.096 --> 00:22:36.817]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

[00:23:54.215 --> 00:23:55.176]  That's 406-251-3270 today.
[00:24:07.918 --> 00:24:12.521]  We are back live, continually taking your phone calls.
[00:24:12.521 --> 00:24:16.664]  We're out this hour into the next.
[00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:34.057]  To answer Sean's question, the Amaro has gotten attention in the last decade because in multiple articles and financial publications like Money and Fortune and the Financial Times of London,
[00:24:35.487 --> 00:24:40.789]  Central bankers have talked about a regional Amaro currency.
[00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:45.692]  I mean, back in 1989, Money Magazine talked about a global currency called the Phoenix.
[00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:48.953]  But all of that is really a distraction.
[00:24:48.953 --> 00:24:56.737]  Sure, you can read the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership, North American Union documents that Judicial Watch sued and got from 2006-2007.
[00:24:56.737 --> 00:24:58.758]  And they talk in there about a North American currency.
[00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:09.177]  But the more I study this, I realize that's all a distraction.
[00:25:09.177 --> 00:25:16.880]  We already have a global treaty with the UN, the United States does, in 2000 for a global standardization for a cashless system.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:24.843]  You will still have cash, but they have strips in them with ID numbers that will track every purchase you make, everything you do.
[00:25:25.963 --> 00:25:32.990]  And under national and international sales taxes and carbon footprint taxes, this has now been publicly proposed.
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:39.797]  They always propose years after they set it up what they're already doing.
[00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:49.567]  To chronicle your purchases, what you eat, where you go, what you do, how you travel, how much fuel you buy, how many aircraft trips you take.
[00:25:51.144 --> 00:25:59.169]  And then when you exhaust your carbon credits for the year, which they'll always lower each year, you then start paying taxes directly to the IMF.
[00:25:59.169 --> 00:26:05.552]  It's been chosen as the main holding company for private central banks, the quasi-government front, to which you'll pay your taxes.
[00:26:05.552 --> 00:26:10.675]  And that's what's happening in Copenhagen in T-minus seven days.
[00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:13.297]  That's what Van Rompuy
[00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:19.412]  I've been mispronouncing it as Von Rumpy, because I saw them in the British Parliament call him Von Rumpy.
[00:26:19.412 --> 00:26:21.597]  It's Von Rump... Rumpooey.
[00:26:21.597 --> 00:26:22.238]  Rumpoy.
[00:26:22.238 --> 00:26:24.884]  The new head of the...
[00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:32.307]  European Union admits global governance that the key to it is the global carbon tax.
[00:26:32.307 --> 00:26:34.788]  So, you see, currency is taxes.
[00:26:34.788 --> 00:26:37.230]  Currency is debt in the banker system.
[00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:54.358]  And so you have SDRs and other cashless transfers between private central banks and they're simply stating that they will directly tax populations through IMF and World Bank payments from the West through the Tobin tax on money transfers and stock transfers and derivatives
[00:26:54.878 --> 00:27:00.644]  Speculation through wellhead taxes, through carbon taxes.
[00:27:00.644 --> 00:27:08.452]  And so you'll still have the dollar, and you'll still have the euro, and you'll still have the Asian Pacific Union's currency they're talking about.
[00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:16.140]  So yes, they're going to move away from national currencies and into euro-ized currencies.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.442]  We're, say, the
[00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:20.620]  I don't know.
[00:27:33.598 --> 00:27:41.602]  The globalists still want to have currencies to compete with each other, even though they control the system, because then they can engage in currency manipulations and carry trades.
[00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:47.705]  And this gets into the economics of currency speculation and manipulation, because they're the insiders.
[00:27:47.705 --> 00:27:51.606]  They know where to invest, how to run the casino.
[00:27:51.606 --> 00:27:58.149]  Then the general public invest in the casino through their pension funds, through the stock market, and gets ripped off.
[00:27:58.149 --> 00:28:01.111]  So they're just consolidating their control.
[00:28:03.646 --> 00:28:06.967]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Brandon in Canada.
[00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:07.828]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[00:28:07.828 --> 00:28:11.109]  Hey Alex, God bless you.
[00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:12.389]  Thanks for the work you do.
[00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:13.250]  Thank you, caller.
[00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.570]  Go ahead.
[00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.191]  Alright, I just wanted to talk to you about just some information.
[00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:24.754]  I don't know if you know this, but I live here in Victoria and I wanted to bring some information to you about the Olympics I found out.
[00:28:25.325 --> 00:28:38.473]  They've announced that officially they're calling it martial law and Amy Goodman was trying to travel up there for a book signing and they interrogated her if she was going to politically criticize the government and threaten to not let her in.
[00:28:38.473 --> 00:28:39.594]  I'm sorry, I'm being obnoxious.
[00:28:39.594 --> 00:28:43.416]  Go ahead.
[00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:44.517]  Yeah, it's funny.
[00:28:44.517 --> 00:28:46.979]  I heard all these things where they're late.
[00:28:46.979 --> 00:28:50.241]  I actually took place in that protest.
[00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:52.022]  You put a link up about that protest.
[00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:53.463]  I took place in that protest.
[00:28:54.437 --> 00:28:59.599]  Well, they're labeling everybody as terrorists now that are against the Olympics.
[00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:05.622]  But the interesting thing is that what they're doing is completely corrupt.
[00:29:05.622 --> 00:29:07.802]  And I don't think a lot of the information is out there.
[00:29:07.802 --> 00:29:14.665]  I mean, number one, they're planning on bringing all of the homeless people from... I mean, this is already in the news and everything.
[00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:15.446]  Everybody knows this.
[00:29:15.446 --> 00:29:18.867]  They're planning on bringing the people that live on the streets in Vancouver
[00:29:19.813 --> 00:29:27.896]  Bringing them over on a boat, like putting them basically by force, putting them in little cells here on the island in Victoria.
[00:29:27.896 --> 00:29:29.197]  Yes, stay there, stay there.
[00:29:29.197 --> 00:29:30.718]  I am aware of this.
[00:29:30.718 --> 00:29:37.620]  And we've all been so marinated in classical tyranny that I don't even get upset about this now when I read it.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:46.124]  Any big G20 event, Olympics event, any type of event, these are used as drills to practice federalization and internationalization.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.486]  Of cities, regions, and countries.
[00:29:50.486 --> 00:29:51.068]  Stay there.
[00:29:51.068 --> 00:29:52.471]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.471 --> 00:29:54.996]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.996 --> 00:29:57.682]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:08.209]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:14.298]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:31:14.298 --> 00:31:16.962]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:23.528]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[00:31:27.592 --> 00:31:32.957]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:31:33.197 --> 00:31:35.277]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:31:35.277 --> 00:31:37.038]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:31:37.038 --> 00:31:39.558]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:31:39.558 --> 00:31:44.299]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:48.000]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.121]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:31:51.121 --> 00:31:53.021]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:55.122]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:32:01.371 --> 00:32:05.375]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.375 --> 00:32:08.619]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:13.424]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:32:13.424 --> 00:32:19.851]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.851 --> 00:32:22.074]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.594 --> 00:32:22.894]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.894 --> 00:32:23.415]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.415 --> 00:32:24.195]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:24.195 --> 00:32:25.376]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:27.597]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.485 --> 00:32:48.772]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.772 --> 00:32:57.900]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:24.546]  So much going on, so much going on.
[00:33:24.546 --> 00:33:28.711]  So many things going on in the world.
[00:33:28.711 --> 00:33:34.477]  Babies dying, mothers crying.
[00:33:34.477 --> 00:33:37.641]  How much all this one human life worth.
[00:33:42.967 --> 00:33:43.627]  What happened?
[00:33:43.627 --> 00:33:58.055]  Well, the nation was on the edge of revolution against George Bush, the petty emperor, and then Obama, the slick Harvard lawyer reading off teleprompters, came and expanded all the wars and Code Pink and everybody else said, we love war now.
[00:33:58.055 --> 00:33:58.756]  It's good.
[00:33:58.756 --> 00:33:59.356]  That's what happened.
[00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:05.039]  That's what happened to peace on Earth, is the phony left-right paradigm short-circuited the people from taking their nation back.
[00:34:07.304 --> 00:34:17.013]  By the way, I'm going to go back to Brandon in Canada about the fact that they're announcing for the Olympics that, yes, this has been in their mainstream newspapers.
[00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:18.174]  You can pull it up.
[00:34:18.174 --> 00:34:22.699]  Homeless to be taken off the streets and locked up.
[00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.580]  Locked up.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.164]  And the media is like, oh, well, they'll be fed and shown movies and taken care of.
[00:34:28.164 --> 00:34:30.306]  What did Schwarzenegger start doing a few months ago?
[00:34:31.684 --> 00:34:35.805]  We actually sent cameras to California to cover the tent cities.
[00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:41.986]  They showed up and said, you're not allowed to sleep on a park bench or in the woods or in a tent, even on city or state property.
[00:34:41.986 --> 00:34:47.048]  We're going to take you by force and lock you up every evening.
[00:34:47.048 --> 00:34:50.388]  The British did this hundreds of years ago in their poor houses.
[00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:52.409]  We're going to lock you up in these facilities.
[00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:56.250]  And then the next step is make you work because you're lazy.
[00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.930]  But then the precedent is set for this to happen.
[00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.571]  And Amy Goodman,
[00:35:01.542 --> 00:35:04.584]  Arrested at the RNC for literally no reason.
[00:35:04.584 --> 00:35:11.449]  The police just come up and arrest her for trying to videotape them arresting other people.
[00:35:11.449 --> 00:35:12.690]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:35:15.225 --> 00:35:24.169]  She was trying to go into Canada for a book signing, and this has made the CBC, it's made the Associated Press, and this happens to everybody that goes to Canada.
[00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:26.710]  I have sent, in the last year, two crews to Canada.
[00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:44.277]  They get interrogated about their political views, and their notes get rummaged through, and I mean, it's worse than... I've talked to people who used to travel to the old Soviet Union, reporters and people, and they say going into Canada is worse than the type of stuff that would happen in the 70s and 80s in the Soviet Union.
[00:35:46.104 --> 00:35:47.525]  Which was clear tyranny.
[00:35:47.525 --> 00:35:52.289]  In fact, we might just play an interview of her later that she gave to CBC.
[00:35:52.289 --> 00:35:56.232]  It's just a few minute interview where she describes, she says, they kept asking, what are your political views?
[00:35:56.232 --> 00:35:59.415]  Are you here to criticize the Olympics?
[00:35:59.415 --> 00:36:03.177]  Are you here to criticize our treatment of people during the Olympics?
[00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:09.262]  And she said, no, I'm here for an event.
[00:36:09.262 --> 00:36:10.563]  I'm gonna give a speech.
[00:36:10.563 --> 00:36:12.185]  It's probably about the wars.
[00:36:13.925 --> 00:36:17.628]  And they said, well, we're not going to let you in if you're going to talk bad about the Olympics.
[00:36:17.628 --> 00:36:20.911]  They then went into her computers, her notes.
[00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:22.112]  They went over everything.
[00:36:23.302 --> 00:36:27.463]  With a fine-tooth comb, she was held for hour after hour, and then she was finally released.
[00:36:27.463 --> 00:36:37.847]  When I went into Canada, they pulled me off the airplane, took me in, screamed at me, cussed at me, and said, we're going to send you to prison for lying to come into Canada.
[00:36:37.847 --> 00:36:42.588]  You're going to be in a Canadian jail for years, and laughed in their black uniforms.
[00:36:42.588 --> 00:36:49.811]  They then got all three of our laptops, and they said, if we find any porn, you're going to prison for transferring porn across state lines.
[00:36:50.871 --> 00:36:52.712]  And I said, porn?
[00:36:52.712 --> 00:36:53.812]  You mean illegal porn?
[00:36:53.812 --> 00:36:55.493]  They said, all porn.
[00:36:55.493 --> 00:37:05.576]  They said, if you have a pin-up of a topless Marilyn Monroe, the actual quote was, if you have a pin-up girl with her top off, you're going to prison.
[00:37:05.576 --> 00:37:14.619]  And by the grace of God, of all three of our computers they searched for 15 hours we were held.
[00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:16.500]  Nothing was found illegal.
[00:37:17.921 --> 00:37:28.605]  Not a Betty Page, not a Marilyn Monroe, and I don't know what computer, what office computer has something like that pop up on it, because it was the transferring it over lines.
[00:37:28.605 --> 00:37:35.167]  Then they called me and they said, we know you're here for Bilderberg, that's why we stopped you, and you're being watched.
[00:37:36.368 --> 00:37:46.291]  And luckily the media was expecting to meet with us, so we were able to get a phone call out because they took our computers and cell phones, but Ryan Slickheisen had a tiny little cell phone.
[00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:50.853]  While we were in the holding area, I took the phone, made the call to Jim Tucker.
[00:37:50.853 --> 00:37:54.374]  He called the CBC that he was supposed to be meeting that morning along with myself.
[00:37:54.374 --> 00:37:56.795]  They showed up with cameras.
[00:37:56.795 --> 00:37:59.536]  At least the media still has the instinct to defend the press.
[00:38:00.556 --> 00:38:10.865]  And so when four or five major media outlets, it ended up being in scores of newspapers all over CBC, all over the other TV networks.
[00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:11.405]  What's the other one?
[00:38:11.405 --> 00:38:15.949]  CTV, Canadian TV, the private channel.
[00:38:15.949 --> 00:38:20.413]  Because a lot of them are based right there in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
[00:38:20.413 --> 00:38:23.255]  And they had to release us.
[00:38:23.255 --> 00:38:28.179]  And then they had these good-looking female cops in a Mustang tailing us the whole time.
[00:38:30.347 --> 00:38:30.788]  We're good to go.
[00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:49.136]  Cops following us, but I didn't tend to notice them as much as the two female police officers.
[00:38:49.136 --> 00:38:52.977]  But that's how I remember it so well.
[00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:54.677]  They were in plain clothes.
[00:38:54.677 --> 00:38:59.898]  But that's what Canada is, and Canadians should wake up and realize you're living in an amazing police state.
[00:38:59.898 --> 00:39:04.519]  I always get these calls and emails from Canadians, great people on average, very friendly, very intelligent.
[00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:07.219]  They say, do you think we'll get as bad as the US?
[00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:08.459]  What planet are you living on?
[00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:09.719]  You're as bad or worse.
[00:39:09.719 --> 00:39:11.100]  You're just like England.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.460]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now and go back to
[00:39:13.482 --> 00:39:17.343]  Brandon in Canada and break this down for people.
[00:39:17.343 --> 00:39:22.745]  The Canadian papers have had headlines like martial law to be in place in Canada for Olympics.
[00:39:22.745 --> 00:39:27.787]  Chinese style police state to be in place in Canada for Olympics.
[00:39:27.787 --> 00:39:29.647]  That's another headline.
[00:39:29.647 --> 00:39:34.209]  Homeless to be detained during Olympics.
[00:39:34.209 --> 00:39:35.709]  They've announced all over the country.
[00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:37.830]  Oh, we're going to have army patrolling the streets now.
[00:39:38.837 --> 00:39:42.601]  So the same thing happening here is happening there in Pittsburgh.
[00:39:42.601 --> 00:39:49.528]  They announced for the three days of the G20 as the global bankers came in to run things ahead of Copenhagen happening in seven days.
[00:39:49.528 --> 00:39:56.194]  And they said no one allowed out on the streets and they would go out and find people barbecuing at parks and hit them with sound cannons.
[00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:59.177]  They would drive through neighborhoods and find kids playing football or baseball.
[00:39:59.177 --> 00:40:00.399]  We have video and photos of this.
[00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:02.500]  And hit them with sound weapons.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:12.687]  They would go to the university, even after the event was closed for a day, on Friday night, and attack the college kids out at night, and chase down young women, beating them in the head with billy clubs.
[00:40:12.687 --> 00:40:14.229]  I mean, it's all on video.
[00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:20.393]  And they would go into the dorms attacking people, just wanting to attack the slaves, wanting to show us that we're slaves.
[00:40:20.393 --> 00:40:26.838]  So they use these special events in China, in Italy, in England, in the United States, in Canada, in Australia.
[00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:30.499]  Australia was one of the first five, six years ago to announce martial law.
[00:40:30.499 --> 00:40:32.880]  You're not allowed to protest, you'll be arrested.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.402]  And so they're just setting the precedent that we live like they do in China or worse.
[00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:46.045]  And so going back to Brandon, now make your point specifically about the homeless and what you're reading in the newspapers.
[00:40:46.045 --> 00:40:55.148]  Well, you know Alex, it's when you can't protest corruption and the kind of corruption that's going on, there's complete tyranny obviously going on here.
[00:40:57.116 --> 00:41:01.759]  You know, just labeling people as terrorists, it's a form of brainwashing.
[00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:07.484]  It's like, you know, nobody else is going to want to protest because then they automatically think they're going to be a terrorist.
[00:41:07.484 --> 00:41:10.346]  Exactly, it's a chilling effect.
[00:41:10.346 --> 00:41:10.806]  Yeah.
[00:41:10.806 --> 00:41:25.877]  So, uh, you know, they even, and they, in the papers they wrote about us, that we were throwing, and this is just ridiculous, they had little horses following us around on the protest, and they said in the papers we were throwing marbles under their feet.
[00:41:27.932 --> 00:41:41.745]  You wanted to hurt the horse and of course the Royal Mounted Police were caught, and it ended up being in national papers, were caught dressed up like anarchists attacking their own officers in
[00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:53.508]  At the SPP meeting in Ottawa about a year and a half ago as a pretext to blame the peaceful protesters and attack them.
[00:41:53.508 --> 00:42:01.194]  Your police are on record lying and staging many false flag attacks.
[00:42:01.194 --> 00:42:07.399]  That's right Alex, and you know about the whole police state, I was actually looking at an application.
[00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:14.225]  They want to hire I think somewhere between five and ten thousand just normal civilian security guards for this.
[00:42:15.157 --> 00:42:19.758]  And then, yeah, I also read over 5,000... And this is just one... This is Vancouver.
[00:42:19.758 --> 00:42:23.659]  It's not a big... It's a five-million-person city, max, I think.
[00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:27.920]  And, you know, over 5,000 military personnel.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.441]  Add to that all the... I bet you, for sure, Victoria, Vancouver police are all gonna be there.
[00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:37.022]  So, literally, there's gonna be, I bet, over 20,000 police there.
[00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:39.863]  So, yeah, talk about a police state.
[00:42:39.863 --> 00:42:42.864]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[00:42:42.864 --> 00:42:43.944]  Um, so...
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:56.466]  And it's interesting, another point you made, Alex, like Canadians really, I think, do need to wake up because we all are just in this little fantasy mode thinking our country is just the safest place in the world.
[00:42:56.466 --> 00:42:58.227]  I mean, most of the population.
[00:42:58.227 --> 00:43:00.408]  I've talked to some people about this.
[00:43:00.408 --> 00:43:03.589]  And they just really don't think any corruption could ever happen here.
[00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:09.372]  They just think all the corruption's happening in America and Canada is just this little safe haven.
[00:43:09.372 --> 00:43:11.173]  And so the Winter Olympics
[00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:34.679]  Are happening all over the country in every major city being locked down with the paramilitary forces and I remember five six years ago Bush got criticized going to Middle Eastern countries and African countries and Asian countries how the police would go in and detain all the homeless people and clear the streets for the Emperor
[00:43:35.874 --> 00:43:38.976]  And then now they do that in Canada, and it's, oh, no big deal!
[00:43:38.976 --> 00:43:47.282]  We're just... Give people specifics of how they're taking them to this lockdown Alcatraz, or Devil's Island.
[00:43:47.282 --> 00:44:02.212]  That's right, Alex, and, you know, most of these people have dogs, and I work, I do ministry with a lot of homeless people, and, you know, their dogs are their best friends, but basically, they're bringing them all to these little, probably dirty cells, saying, oh, you know, you have to stay here,
[00:44:03.235 --> 00:44:19.141]  Um, you know, there's thousands of homeless people in Vancouver, and just bringing them forcibly on boats, you know, because you need a boat to get to this island, which is Victoria, right next to Vancouver, and they're going to be putting them in cells for the time being.
[00:44:19.141 --> 00:44:22.983]  You can't have your dog in there either, so no one knows what's going to happen to their dogs.
[00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:25.692]  And notice how they spin it.
[00:44:25.692 --> 00:44:27.272]  Notice how they spin it.
[00:44:27.272 --> 00:44:29.233]  Oh, they get to stay in the cells.
[00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.274]  They get to go to the center.
[00:44:31.274 --> 00:44:39.777]  Just like Seattle in 99, when the Delta Force, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Times, in my film, police state to the takeover.
[00:44:41.209 --> 00:44:43.090]  So there's your documentation.
[00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:47.291]  Took people to the Sandpoint Naval Brig, now run by FEMA.
[00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:50.692]  And again, this is how it worked in Germany in the mid-1930s.
[00:44:50.692 --> 00:44:53.132]  They first started rounding up the retarded.
[00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:55.673]  Rounding up the homeless.
[00:44:55.673 --> 00:44:58.074]  Taking people's disabled children.
[00:44:58.074 --> 00:44:59.114]  The same things.
[00:44:59.114 --> 00:45:01.275]  Rationing health care to the old.
[00:45:01.275 --> 00:45:07.156]  It's the same eugenics, scientific dictatorship we've seen over and over again.
[00:45:07.156 --> 00:45:07.216]  And
[00:45:09.747 --> 00:45:14.789]  They're using any big event as a pretext to fully take over society.
[00:45:14.789 --> 00:45:16.689]  This is how freedom dies.
[00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:19.970]  I appreciate your call, Brandon.
[00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:30.453]  The good news is, folks are shooting video of this, they're posting it to YouTube, and the alternative media is exposing what's happening all over the planet.
[00:45:30.453 --> 00:45:35.055]  The good news is, these tyrants who put the iron fist of
[00:45:36.215 --> 00:45:41.916]  Authoritarian oppression in a velvet glove are being exposed for who they are.
[00:45:41.916 --> 00:45:53.199]  By the way, we are changing other groups in Florida, in Colorado, in Illinois, all over the country, in Tennessee, are going in and confronting Al Gore.
[00:45:53.199 --> 00:45:54.239]  It's mainly our listeners.
[00:45:54.239 --> 00:45:56.119]  I want to salute you and praise you.
[00:45:56.119 --> 00:46:03.201]  We've been posting these videos every other day on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of our wonderful activist listeners.
[00:46:05.057 --> 00:46:08.919]  Going into book signing saying, Al Gore, what do you think of climate gate?
[00:46:08.919 --> 00:46:11.861]  Al Gore, what do you think of lying and saying polar bears can't swim?
[00:46:11.861 --> 00:46:16.924]  Al Gore, what do you think of the fact that the earth is actually cooling according to the real climate record?
[00:46:16.924 --> 00:46:18.505]  And Al Gore is flipping out.
[00:46:19.827 --> 00:46:23.809]  Having security grab them and drag them out, even when they're polite.
[00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:25.349]  That's making a scene.
[00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:34.253]  And then all the TV, all the newspapers are then going outside the bookstores and other places where Gore's going and interviewing them.
[00:46:34.253 --> 00:46:37.455]  And so now they're taking over all the newspaper and TV reports.
[00:46:38.365 --> 00:46:42.447]  And the fact of ClimateGate and his fraud is being forced.
[00:46:42.447 --> 00:46:44.868]  I literally want to salute and thank all of you.
[00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:52.931]  Every single person, every single group that shot video, please contact ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[00:46:52.931 --> 00:47:04.316]  We're going to go through there every day so we can schedule a show this week or next week where I have 5, 10, 15 different groups on to talk about what they've done to Gore exposing this criminal.
[00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:07.597]  This is how we take the country back.
[00:47:07.597 --> 00:47:10.697]  They can lock down whole cities for the Olympics or for the G20.
[00:47:10.697 --> 00:47:13.618]  They can't go lock down every city for Al Gore.
[00:47:13.618 --> 00:47:19.159]  And even if they try, it exposes them as the petty tyrants they are.
[00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:22.480]  And I want to beg the We Are Change folks.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.642]  Send me your video if you want it to be in Follow the Republic 2.
[00:47:27.642 --> 00:47:31.243]  Because we have the great We Are Change footage of Jay Rockefeller being exposed.
[00:47:31.243 --> 00:47:32.923]  This film is going to be about eugenics.
[00:47:34.093 --> 00:47:38.095]  And we're feverishly working on it, and it will be seen millions of times.
[00:47:38.095 --> 00:47:39.676]  My films get seen millions of times.
[00:47:39.676 --> 00:47:44.578]  All your great YouTubes get seen tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, especially when we link to them.
[00:47:44.578 --> 00:47:47.920]  We try to promote what you're doing so others see it and go out and take action.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:59.285]  But by putting it in a film, we will show the big picture, and this will spur even more people to this type of a very effective, efficient activism, where you take over the TV reports.
[00:47:59.285 --> 00:48:00.946]  You take over the newspaper reports.
[00:48:01.889 --> 00:48:02.969]  This is growing.
[00:48:02.969 --> 00:48:06.230]  This is how we're going to bring these tyrants to their knees and expose their fraud.
[00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.250]  So, we are Change Ohio.
[00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.331]  We are Change Illinois.
[00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:11.531]  We are Change Florida.
[00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:13.311]  We are Change Colorado.
[00:48:13.311 --> 00:48:16.312]  All these groups and other groups going out confronting Gore.
[00:48:16.312 --> 00:48:22.713]  If you want your footage in the film, dump it on DVD or on DV cam, mail it to P.O.
[00:48:22.713 --> 00:48:23.573]  Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:31.581]  Because we want to put you in Fall of the Republic, too.
[00:48:31.581 --> 00:48:36.984]  We want what you've done to be seen by millions.
[00:48:36.984 --> 00:48:39.746]  And we've done everything we can from day one to support We Are Change.
[00:48:39.746 --> 00:48:43.148]  We salute We Are Change and all these other wonderful activist groups.
[00:48:43.148 --> 00:48:48.011]  And this film is just going to be dynamite, especially with the Al Gore footage we're getting in in the mail.
[00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:49.332]  But I want a lot of it.
[00:48:49.332 --> 00:48:53.094]  Because some of it's shot on little bitty cameras or it's really jerky or shaky.
[00:48:53.094 --> 00:48:53.594]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:55.455 --> 00:48:58.937]  What it's all about, and you take over the local media, that's what's more important.
[00:48:58.937 --> 00:49:02.119]  The point is, some of it's really clear, we're now seeing online.
[00:49:02.119 --> 00:49:04.460]  We need that video.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:11.164]  Please take action today, ladies and gentlemen, and send us a letter with who gets credit and with our authorization to use it.
[00:49:11.164 --> 00:49:17.407]  PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:49:17.407 --> 00:49:22.530]  Because I've made the decision while writing Fall of the Republic 2, and it's always changing as new developments happen,
[00:49:23.905 --> 00:49:28.449]  To make this about activism and solutions and taking our system back.
[00:49:28.449 --> 00:49:42.321]  And we need other young heroes, heroes in the making, to see what the great men and women are doing out there confronting Al Gore, confronting the CFR people, confronting Senator Jay Rockefeller, the head eugenicist.
[00:49:42.321 --> 00:49:45.463]  It's just so exciting what you're doing and I just want to thank all of you.
[00:49:45.463 --> 00:49:49.326]  We're going to come back and talk to Eddie, Greg, Ray, Bad Baby, and others.
[00:49:49.326 --> 00:49:49.387]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:49:53.877 --> 00:50:04.005]  I did want to just throw out, too, if you want to support us and get a tool that will really wake people up, get Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:04.005 --> 00:50:06.547]  And while supplies last, they're selling out quickly.

[00:50:15.854 --> 00:50:17.856]  Exposing Obama as a puppet.

[00:50:31.405 --> 00:50:38.830]  Give it under the tree or under the tannin bomb or for Hanukkah or for whatever.
[00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.473]  It is so important to do this.
[00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:45.195]  Or order the DVD and give them the DVD and the t-shirt.
[00:50:46.229 --> 00:50:50.675]  You can put in the address you want it mailed to, put in a comment what you want said as a card.

[00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:57.203]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[00:51:57.203 --> 00:52:02.168]  Seasons greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:52:02.168 --> 00:52:06.193]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.193 --> 00:52:09.436]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.436 --> 00:52:10.858]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:14.223]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.223 --> 00:52:20.604]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:26.146]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.146 --> 00:52:35.788]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.908 --> 00:52:38.249]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.249 --> 00:52:39.850]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.291]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:44.432]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.432 --> 00:52:49.575]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.575 --> 00:52:54.577]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:54.577 --> 00:52:58.699]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.382]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:53:03.382 --> 00:53:06.624]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:53:06.624 --> 00:53:10.107]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:53:11.064 --> 00:53:20.290]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:22.512]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[00:53:22.512 --> 00:53:28.216]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:53:28.216 --> 00:53:32.999]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:38.643]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:53:38.643 --> 00:53:41.725]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:53:41.725 --> 00:53:47.269]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:53:47.269 --> 00:53:50.551]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.

[00:53:56.576 --> 00:53:58.197]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:53:58.197 --> 00:53:59.558]  This call could save your life.
[00:54:03.499 --> 00:54:09.903]  Just in case somebody didn't tap you on the shoulder and tell you, we're in the middle of a revolution against tyranny right now.
[00:54:09.903 --> 00:54:13.365]  The revolution is on.
[00:54:13.365 --> 00:54:19.830]  It is peaceful, but the establishment is trying to jackboot, intimidate the people.
[00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:22.171]  I want to tell the police and military something.
[00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:25.353]  I know a lot of you are good men and women and know what's going on.
[00:54:25.353 --> 00:54:28.495]  You're being set up to be chewed up by the American people.
[00:54:28.495 --> 00:54:31.097]  We don't want this to get violent.
[00:54:32.554 --> 00:54:34.135]  We are doing everything we can.
[00:54:34.135 --> 00:54:35.655]  Crank up Johnny Cash!
[00:54:35.655 --> 00:54:37.116]  Make the choice.
[00:54:37.116 --> 00:54:39.577]  Decide who you serve.
[00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:41.417]  The truth or the lie.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:53.722]  What does your gut tell you if you work for the system?
[00:54:53.722 --> 00:54:58.305]  Do you like working for a bunch of Kinley, Madoff types?
[00:54:58.305 --> 00:55:01.787]  Do you like working for people openly setting up tyrannical world government?
[00:55:01.787 --> 00:55:02.767]  You know you want to join us.
[00:55:02.767 --> 00:55:06.289]  You know in your gut you want to come in for the big win against tyranny.
[00:55:15.373 --> 00:55:17.915]  You know you want to join us.
[00:55:17.915 --> 00:55:20.737]  It's an open hand, not a clenched fist.
[00:55:20.737 --> 00:55:22.719]  It's offered.
[00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:28.303]  It's proffered.
[00:55:28.303 --> 00:55:29.024]  We're here.
[00:55:29.024 --> 00:55:32.266]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:35.188]  Run on for a long time.
[00:55:35.188 --> 00:55:38.070]  Run on for a long time.
[00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.033]  Sooner or later, God will put you down.
[00:55:41.033 --> 00:55:43.575]  Sooner or later, God will put you down.
[00:55:45.083 --> 00:55:46.264]  Look what happened to Hitler.
[00:55:46.264 --> 00:55:48.405]  Look what happened to Sudan.
[00:55:48.405 --> 00:55:49.766]  Look what happened to Pol Pot.
[00:55:49.766 --> 00:55:51.146]  Look what happened to all these people.
[00:55:51.146 --> 00:55:52.387]  The people, the truth, is rising.
[00:55:52.387 --> 00:55:53.188]  Eddie in Virginia.
[00:55:53.188 --> 00:55:54.188]  You're on the air, Eddie.
[00:56:15.068 --> 00:56:22.833]  I want to know how much of our presence in Afghanistan is tied to that Unicor pipeline?
[00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:24.014]  A large portion of it.
[00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:25.095]  It's trillions.
[00:56:25.095 --> 00:56:33.020]  What was estimated seven years ago at eight trillion dollars in discovered removable reserves.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:39.965]  And of course you look at five trillion leveraged to the 500 billion in opium a year and that answers all your questions why we're there.
[00:56:41.926 --> 00:56:51.988]  Now as far as the proxy armies that are being used by the United States to war against our own military, they are being financed via the opium.
[00:56:52.884 --> 00:57:11.107]  Yes, it's on record, our own special forces colonels have gone public, literally hundreds of mainstream articles, MSNBC, you name it, Airlift of Evil, just Google MSNBC Airlift of Evil, Times of London, flying Taliban al-Qaeda out to safety, financing them to attack our own troops.
[00:57:11.107 --> 00:57:22.089]  Literally, if you've got a war making trillions of dollars in weapons sales and no-bid contracts and opium and oil a year in Central Asia and the Middle East, you will finance
[00:57:23.387 --> 00:57:25.948]  What percentage of that money is laundered through U.S.
[00:57:25.948 --> 00:57:26.128]  banks?
[00:57:50.544 --> 00:57:51.145]  Okay.
[00:57:51.145 --> 00:57:51.845]  Thank you, sir.
[00:57:51.845 --> 00:57:53.807]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:57:53.807 --> 00:57:54.467]  Good points.
[00:57:54.467 --> 00:57:55.748]  Eddie in Virginia.
[00:57:55.748 --> 00:57:55.948]  Okay.
[00:57:55.948 --> 00:57:57.529]  Greg, Ray, Bad Baby, and others.
[00:58:22.697 --> 00:58:24.798]  My 20-month-old was throwing food this morning.
[00:58:24.798 --> 00:58:26.938]  I said, bad baby.
[00:58:26.938 --> 00:58:30.619]  We have another bad baby on the line.
[00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:31.719]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:31.719 --> 00:58:37.041]  I didn't say bad baby, but I thought bad baby.
[00:58:37.041 --> 00:58:42.342]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:58:42.342 --> 00:58:46.063]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.543 --> 00:58:59.689]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:58:59.689 --> 00:59:03.051]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:59:03.051 --> 00:59:08.915]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:59:08.915 --> 00:59:13.698]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:59:13.698 --> 00:59:16.060]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:16.700]  I'm good.

[00:59:53.753 --> 00:59:56.133]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.133 --> 00:59:58.934]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:10.300]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.881]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.881 --> 01:00:13.442]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:17.624]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.624 --> 01:00:27.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.668 --> 01:00:30.930]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:00:32.642 --> 01:00:42.605]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the radio show in living television color at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus 30 minutes.
[01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:49.807]  I'm going to play the incredible job that We Are Change Chicago did confronting Al Gore and making news headlines.
[01:00:49.807 --> 01:00:50.707]  We salute
[01:00:51.638 --> 01:00:57.741]  We are Change Chicago and all the other great activists out there that are just doing an amazing job.
[01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.542]  It's so wonderful to see this happening.
[01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:03.803]  This is really catching fire now in the minds of men and women everywhere and spreading.
[01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:10.506]  And everywhere that slime ball, that demonic Nelly goes, he's being confronted with the truth.
[01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:11.327]  This is just beautiful.
[01:01:12.762 --> 01:01:13.462]  That is coming up.
[01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:14.643]  We're going to break down ClimateGate.
[01:01:14.643 --> 01:01:20.446]  We're going to break down the sad, tragic shooting and murder of these four police officers.
[01:01:20.446 --> 01:01:30.591]  We're getting ready for work at a coffee shop, and a trend I've noticed there that I've seen no one else point out, so we'll be going over that as well today.
[01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:32.672]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:33.772]  Greg in Tennessee.
[01:01:33.772 --> 01:01:34.613]  Greg, you're on the air.
[01:01:34.613 --> 01:01:36.654]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:36.654 --> 01:01:39.595]  Greg calling from the great state of Tennessee, the Volunteer State.
[01:01:40.453 --> 01:01:46.075]  And I'm a businessman, and one of the things I try to measure my business on is results.
[01:01:46.075 --> 01:01:53.517]  And I've been following you for a while now, and I guess my question to you is, do you feel like we're making progress here?
[01:01:53.517 --> 01:01:59.299]  Are we just kind of going to the bathroom in the wind, so to speak, because of the powers that be?
[01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.439]  Okay, that's double-edged.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.100]  I think?
[01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:22.830]  More people are cynical and want instant success.
[01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:28.334]  They want to go out and protest Al Gore one time and see everything collapse.
[01:02:28.334 --> 01:02:29.756]  That's not going to happen.
[01:02:29.756 --> 01:02:37.102]  We're not going to defeat their criminal system and bring down their Tower of Babel without incremental long view of history.
[01:02:37.102 --> 01:02:44.088]  The globalists understand never giving up, always taking action with their evil greed and paradical desire.
[01:02:45.296 --> 01:02:49.777]  We need to understand that it's a long, incremental fight with truth and liberty.
[01:02:49.777 --> 01:02:57.099]  And so, yes, I mean, we're having so many... I mean, I'm not trying to toot my horn, but, sir, can you... I can't even express to you the level of success I've had.
[01:02:57.099 --> 01:03:01.841]  I'm only one attack frigate on the seas fighting the globalists here.
[01:03:02.581 --> 01:03:09.063]  Okay, and I mean, every ship we engage, to use that analogy, we're blowing it to smithereens.
[01:03:09.063 --> 01:03:14.885]  I mean, I'm just out here smashing enemy forces left and right with my wonderful audience that's taking action.
[01:03:14.885 --> 01:03:20.526]  But we need to launch more patrol boats, more missile cruisers, more attack ships, more torpedo planes.
[01:03:20.526 --> 01:03:26.568]  And every one of you that takes action and gets involved and just volunteers, like you said, from the volunteer state,
[01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:29.109]  I mean, look at the Tennessee groups.
[01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.010]  I believe it was We Are Change.
[01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.171]  I saw it in the paper.
[01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:34.293]  They went and confronted Al Gore and took over all the newspaper coverage.
[01:03:34.293 --> 01:03:35.094]  Look at Florida.
[01:03:35.094 --> 01:03:35.974]  Look everywhere else.
[01:03:35.974 --> 01:03:42.019]  Everywhere he goes, everywhere he goes, he's being shooken up, he's stuttering, he's red-faced, he's bumbling.
[01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:47.062]  He makes the wrong choice, has his goons grab people, which is a crime.
[01:03:47.062 --> 01:03:49.444]  They don't even resist and private goons grab people.
[01:03:49.444 --> 01:03:53.026]  That blows up in their face, goes all over TV and radio and print.
[01:03:53.026 --> 01:03:56.189]  I mean, just everywhere we stand up, we kick their butt.
[01:03:57.116 --> 01:04:00.501]  So yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[01:04:00.501 --> 01:04:01.822]  Do we have a fighting chance?
[01:04:01.822 --> 01:04:03.705]  If we fight, there's no way we can lose!
[01:04:14.865 --> 01:04:20.589]  His thing was, well, I'm just one guy with a few guns, and that's kind of a defeatist attitude.
[01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:21.250]  Exactly!
[01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:26.533]  Guns are a key insurance policy against tyranny, but they're the most disgusting cop-out.
[01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:32.077]  People just sitting on a hoard of weapons and food, never doing anything, waiting to be dug out of their holes.
[01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:40.183]  You need the backup in the boogie-out plan, the bug-out plan, but at the same time, you need to be out there engaged at city council in a suit.
[01:04:42.022 --> 01:04:42.663]  Yes, organize and then engage.
[01:04:42.663 --> 01:04:44.364]  A lot of people over-organize and want to get it just perfect.
[01:04:44.364 --> 01:04:47.187]  Look, just get up on your hind legs, put your fist in balls, and start swinging.
[01:05:01.343 --> 01:05:04.365]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.365 --> 01:05:09.689]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.689 --> 01:05:11.751]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:16.754]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.754 --> 01:05:17.655]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.036]  When do you want it?
[01:05:19.036 --> 01:05:20.918]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:21.998]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.998 --> 01:05:24.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.541]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:27.063]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:27.063 --> 01:05:32.347]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.347 --> 01:05:35.930]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:39.393]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.733 --> 01:05:40.954]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.954 --> 01:05:41.855]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:42.977]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.977 --> 01:05:43.898]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:44.999]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:48.042]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:06:00.296 --> 01:06:07.281]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:06:07.281 --> 01:06:08.562]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:06:08.562 --> 01:06:09.382]  It's very real.

[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.161]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.161 --> 01:08:08.122]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:10.677]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.677 --> 01:08:12.258]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.258 --> 01:08:13.218]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:17.999]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.999 --> 01:08:23.861]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.861 --> 01:08:26.761]  Eight minutes into our number two.
[01:08:26.761 --> 01:08:33.963]  I just had a caller from Oregon, Tennessee, saying, are we making headway, or are we just whistling in the wind?
[01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:41.413]  Resistance is victory.
[01:08:41.413 --> 01:08:43.153]  Having a fighting spirit.
[01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:45.173]  Knowing you're on the right side of history.
[01:08:45.173 --> 01:08:46.134]  Taking action.
[01:08:46.134 --> 01:08:48.754]  We're not going to defeat the New World Order overnight.
[01:08:48.754 --> 01:08:52.475]  None of us are going to have instant success.
[01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:57.736]  But it's almost like a certain harmonic frequency can shatter crystal.
[01:08:57.736 --> 01:09:04.998]  And have you ever stood up against a big metal pylon in a warehouse and just slowly started, in rhythm, hitting on it?
[01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:11.656]  Over and over again and catching that right harmonic frequency and soon the whole roof is shaking.
[01:09:12.927 --> 01:09:23.450]  You ever seen how when you turn on the water faucet on low and it happens to send a harmonic frequency through the pipes and they start groaning and shaking and it sounds like a train wreck is happening?
[01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:24.331]  It's the same thing.
[01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:37.315]  It's that woodpecker effect of pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and they'll tell you, oh you're losing, there's no way to fight us, oh there's no new world order but we want global government.
[01:09:38.755 --> 01:09:40.096]  Just on and on and on.
[01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:41.676]  Oh, you're gonna lose, GI.
[01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:42.676]  Oh, there's no victory.
[01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:44.477]  There's no way you can win.
[01:09:44.477 --> 01:09:46.318]  Oh, the New World Order's a foregone conclusion.
[01:09:46.318 --> 01:09:50.739]  Look, we've paid off all your preachers to tell you that, to lay down that it's the rapture.
[01:09:50.739 --> 01:09:52.040]  Drilling that in your brain.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.500]  Drilling it over and over.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.261]  You're gonna lose.
[01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:55.581]  You're gonna lose.
[01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:59.283]  There's no New World Order, but we want you to have a New World Order.
[01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:05.385]  Al Gore laughs and smiles and gets arrogant the first four or five times he's been confronted in the last month and a half.
[01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:21.516]  By different activist groups about global warming being man-made, being a fraud, and now he gets angry, red-faced, now he stutters, now he gets angry, now he's beginning to freak out, and more people are coming, and more, and more, and now everywhere he ever goes for the rest of his life!
[01:10:21.516 --> 01:10:30.940]  Because this form of activism that I unknowingly pioneered... I mean, people for thousands of years have gone to public events and shouted down the tyrant.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:39.405]  There were famous cases in history where corrupt kings and nobles and lords would be shouted down by an old woman.
[01:10:39.405 --> 01:10:42.887]  And a lot of times the lords would say, seize her and drag her away.
[01:10:42.887 --> 01:10:44.728]  People say, look, they're arresting people.
[01:10:44.728 --> 01:10:47.509]  That only blows up in their face bigger.
[01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.551]  That's your sacrifice.
[01:10:49.551 --> 01:10:50.751]  But no one's getting arrested here.
[01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:51.772]  They're just being drug out.
[01:10:51.772 --> 01:10:53.633]  The media is like, well, why'd you drag him out?
[01:10:53.633 --> 01:10:54.794]  Let's go talk to these people.
[01:10:56.581 --> 01:11:02.383]  And that's just one example of Al Gore bursting into flames, burning down in front of us.
[01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:04.864]  I mean, this guy's a ten-alarm fire.
[01:11:04.864 --> 01:11:10.945]  If he was a five-story building, he's collapsing right now.
[01:11:10.945 --> 01:11:25.370]  And I would go confront Janet Reno, or I would go confront George W. Bush, I would go confront General McCaffrey and hold up a Reuters article about how his designate, the head of all army operations over narcotics,
[01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:40.834]  In Latin America, was caught shipping masses of heroin and cocaine, and he literally turned red-faced, paused, began stuttering, and everyone booed him and began clapping me.
[01:11:40.834 --> 01:11:43.115]  All you got to do is stand up to him.
[01:11:43.115 --> 01:11:45.397]  What did the founder of the Texas Rangers say?
[01:11:45.397 --> 01:11:49.059]  I forget the exact quote.
[01:11:49.059 --> 01:11:52.001]  A man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right.
[01:11:53.953 --> 01:11:55.353]  Who keeps on a-coming.
[01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:56.413]  It's that last part.
[01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:59.014]  Keeps on a-coming.
[01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.974]  You may demonize me in the national media.
[01:12:00.974 --> 01:12:02.875]  You may beat me up in a parking lot.
[01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:04.315]  You may physically attack me.
[01:12:04.315 --> 01:12:05.295]  You may audit me.
[01:12:05.295 --> 01:12:07.595]  You may do whatever you want.
[01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:10.496]  I will never stop.
[01:12:10.496 --> 01:12:12.836]  I am setting my will against you.
[01:12:12.836 --> 01:12:13.956]  Fully.
[01:12:13.956 --> 01:12:16.357]  And you can't consciously set your will.
[01:12:16.357 --> 01:12:20.517]  You have to just totally turn yourself mentally over to something.
[01:12:20.517 --> 01:12:22.458]  And it's a change of heart.
[01:12:22.458 --> 01:12:23.218]  It's a decision.
[01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:26.707]  You have to say, I am committed.
[01:12:26.707 --> 01:12:28.188]  I am not going to stop.
[01:12:28.188 --> 01:12:33.311]  And ladies and gentlemen, that is invincible.
[01:12:33.311 --> 01:12:37.435]  That is unstoppable in the numbers we have.
[01:12:37.435 --> 01:12:41.297]  I mean, if the globalists outnumbered us 10,000 to 1, they would just exterminate us.
[01:12:41.297 --> 01:12:43.619]  But we outnumber them 10,000 to 1.
[01:12:43.619 --> 01:12:48.122]  We outnumber them 1,000 to 1 in every town and city.
[01:12:48.122 --> 01:12:49.984]  Top globalists, we outnumber them
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.740]  A million to one?
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.221]  I mean, seven billion people?
[01:12:54.221 --> 01:12:56.221]  What is there, six billion?
[01:12:56.221 --> 01:13:02.423]  Eight hundred million plus now in the world at the last sub-census last year?
[01:13:02.423 --> 01:13:11.325]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, last year wrote a book called Superclass, where he said there's six thousand super gophers to less than twenty families that rule the planet.
[01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:13.046]  He's quite proud of himself.
[01:13:13.046 --> 01:13:16.607]  I had him on the radio show.
[01:13:16.607 --> 01:13:20.588]  And I said to him during breaks, John Harmon heard all this, I said, why are you coming on here?
[01:13:22.137 --> 01:13:23.138]  I mean, you know who I am.
[01:13:23.138 --> 01:13:23.838]  You know I'm against you.
[01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:30.423]  He said, well, we just want to try to convince you that we're just normal people and that our plan for globalization is what's needed.
[01:13:30.423 --> 01:13:34.066]  And we're interested in understanding you, Mr. Jones.
[01:13:34.066 --> 01:13:36.408]  And I now have top globalists.
[01:13:36.408 --> 01:13:37.348]  And I am a reporter.
[01:13:37.348 --> 01:13:38.669]  That's one of the hats I wear.
[01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:44.553]  So when a globalist calls me up and says, I want to talk to you off record, they only call me because it's off record.
[01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.395]  Some people go, well, you need to say who they are.
[01:13:48.723 --> 01:14:01.970]  Yeah, and then lose the fact that, oh yeah, people are like, we don't believe you just released the Homeland Security secret report saying veterans, gun owners, conservatives, and libertarians are terrorists, and that Homeland Security's really set up for them.
[01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:05.732]  People tried to bait me the first few days when we released that this year.
[01:14:05.732 --> 01:14:08.554]  Back in, what was it, back in January?
[01:14:08.554 --> 01:14:10.255]  Saying it's not real.
[01:14:10.255 --> 01:14:14.037]  Tell us the police officers, tell us the federal marshals that gave you this.
[01:14:16.547 --> 01:14:22.129]  But then days later it came out it was all real, and that we broke it, and uh... See?
[01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:23.629]  Those are little tricks they use.
[01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:25.950]  Oh, tell us who your sources are!
[01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:28.891]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna tell you who my sources are.
[01:14:28.891 --> 01:14:30.852]  They'd have to put me on the rack.
[01:14:30.852 --> 01:14:33.172]  They'd have to torture me to find out who my sources are.
[01:14:33.172 --> 01:14:43.216]  I'll never give up my sources, because I'm an honorable person, A, and B, I would lose my sources.
[01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:43.716]  But now,
[01:14:47.754 --> 01:14:53.536]  I've got high-level globalists calling me up.
[01:14:53.536 --> 01:15:00.058]  I can't believe Thursday a high-level globalist wants to come here and meet with me.
[01:15:00.058 --> 01:15:02.659]  Folks, if you only knew how real this is.
[01:15:02.659 --> 01:15:07.701]  If you only knew that they are afraid of me because I have the spirit of victory.
[01:15:07.701 --> 01:15:11.202]  Something all of you have as well if you just recognize it and let it grow in you.
[01:15:12.659 --> 01:15:13.960]  It's not just confidence.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:27.051]  It's the confidence of knowing you're right, knowing you're on the right side of history, and taking action and saying, look, even if I don't have a snowball's chance in Hades of winning this thing, which we have a lot better chance than that, I'm going to do the right thing.
[01:15:27.051 --> 01:15:30.334]  All right, I said I'm going to your calls.
[01:15:30.334 --> 01:15:32.456]  Let's just go to them right now.
[01:15:32.456 --> 01:15:34.257]  Ray in California.
[01:15:34.257 --> 01:15:35.118]  Ray, you're on the air.
[01:15:35.118 --> 01:15:41.163]  Alex, I want to know if you have investigated or you have any information
[01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:49.263]  You know, they changed that in 2003, ahead of the 2004 election, in all of their symbols, but namely the elephant with the top half being blue, the bottom half being red, and the stars had been
[01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:24.277]  Tips pointed up, they inverted them, and then the election before that, Al Gore, in his famous debates, the Democrat debates, they projected upside-down stars and a devil on the wall as clear as day.
[01:16:24.277 --> 01:16:26.859]  And yes, these are a group of lunatic Satanists.
[01:16:26.859 --> 01:16:33.425]  And it's just a fact, I've been to one of their rituals, I infiltrated it, back in 2000, Bohemian Grove, and I'm telling you,
[01:16:34.505 --> 01:16:37.767]  Truth is a thousand times stranger than fiction.
[01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:41.088]  But did the Republican Party give an explanation of the reason why?
[01:16:41.088 --> 01:16:45.511]  No, and they've been asked why.
[01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:48.472]  Strange.
[01:16:48.472 --> 01:16:49.553]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:16:49.553 --> 01:16:52.434]  They believe they get more power.
[01:16:52.434 --> 01:17:01.719]  They're Luciferians, and they believe the destructive force of the horned god slash goddess is more powerful
[01:17:03.564 --> 01:17:06.246]  Generally associated with the male force.
[01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:10.791]  And so they're letting you know, even in their paradigm, that, hey, we're black magic.
[01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:13.673]  We're into deviltry.
[01:17:13.673 --> 01:17:20.599]  Chris Matthews, when he uses the GOP graphic, he uses the old one with the stars right side up.
[01:17:20.599 --> 01:17:26.785]  That just may be because that's what their graphic is in their computer.
[01:17:26.785 --> 01:17:27.406]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:17:27.406 --> 01:17:29.567]  You can read too much into it, but...
[01:17:31.403 --> 01:17:36.548]  I figured they would get it right, being a mainstream media network, that they would at least get the correct logo up on the screen.
[01:17:36.548 --> 01:17:43.754]  Yeah, I haven't checked it in a few months, but last time I was on the... In fact, guys, will you pull up rnc.org, Republican National Committee?
[01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:48.919]  Let's see if they still got the Baphomet going there, flashing their gang sign.
[01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.301]  Thank you so much for the call, Ray.
[01:17:51.301 --> 01:17:52.842]  Bad Baby in Michigan.
[01:17:52.842 --> 01:17:53.363]  You're on the air.
[01:17:55.319 --> 01:17:56.880]  Hello, Alex.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.161]  Hi.
[01:17:58.161 --> 01:18:01.182]  I am a fellow radio host, too.
[01:18:01.182 --> 01:18:04.544]  I just got done interviewing Dr. Betty Martini.
[01:18:04.544 --> 01:18:07.165]  I've also interviewed Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[01:18:07.165 --> 01:18:07.666]  Good!
[01:18:07.666 --> 01:18:09.046]  What's on your mind, ma'am?
[01:18:09.046 --> 01:18:11.428]  Well, let me tell you.
[01:18:11.428 --> 01:18:19.172]  I want to tell you that I'm a targeted individual from our government for standing up against these criminals.
[01:18:19.172 --> 01:18:23.034]  And this man that just called and said, the man that said, I'm just one person.
[01:18:23.034 --> 01:18:24.675]  Well, I'm just one person, too, honey.
[01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:30.331]  And my life has been threatened and I've had many attempts on my life.
[01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.351]  Really?
[01:18:31.351 --> 01:18:32.012]  Oh yes.
[01:18:32.012 --> 01:18:32.452]  Oh yes.
[01:18:32.452 --> 01:18:35.953]  I've had gas turned on in my building and almost blew up.
[01:18:35.953 --> 01:18:37.873]  I've had my shotgun jammed.
[01:18:37.873 --> 01:18:39.553]  I've been poisoned.
[01:18:39.553 --> 01:18:42.174]  And it's because I do what you do, Alex.
[01:18:42.174 --> 01:18:44.194]  I stand up and say no.
[01:18:44.194 --> 01:18:45.935]  I am going to fight these people.
[01:18:45.935 --> 01:18:50.216]  Well, most people I know that fight the New World Order, because there's so many of us now, don't have any bad
[01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:51.657]  We're good to go.
[01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:29.677]  Certainly, you know, when they're openly announcing they want to microchip the population, they're openly announcing mind control and the CIA declassifies their mind control manual, that just came out a few days ago, then a lot of people that are suggestible and already a little paranoid, I'm not saying that's you, really get set off by it.
[01:19:30.589 --> 01:19:40.215]  I mean, I've seen all these videos online where schizophrenics are shooting video out of their window as some repair guy works on the telephone lines, and they're going, look at him!
[01:19:40.215 --> 01:19:40.975]  He's a fed!
[01:19:40.975 --> 01:19:45.678]  And the guys out there eating a sandwich are picking their nose, and I can tell you right there, they're not a fed.
[01:19:45.678 --> 01:19:49.861]  So look out, they're getting paranoid.
[01:19:49.861 --> 01:19:51.762]  But hey, in this day and age, you can't blame you.
[01:19:51.762 --> 01:19:53.403]  Maybe they are after you.
[01:19:53.403 --> 01:19:56.205]  But if these folks go after you, they tend to get you.
[01:19:56.205 --> 01:19:59.386]  And turning your gas on, it isn't usually how they do it.
[01:19:59.386 --> 01:19:59.987]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.223 --> 01:20:01.883]  Hello.
[01:20:01.883 --> 01:20:06.645]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.

[01:20:11.466 --> 01:20:16.527]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:20:16.527 --> 01:20:21.189]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:25.290]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:29.774]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:20:29.774 --> 01:20:34.337]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:20:34.337 --> 01:20:36.419]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:20:36.419 --> 01:20:38.581]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:20:38.581 --> 01:20:40.482]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:20:40.482 --> 01:20:46.207]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[01:20:46.207 --> 01:20:49.609]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[01:21:00.934 --> 01:21:07.896]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graff Hunter safes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:10.737]  Graff Hunter safes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.737 --> 01:21:15.378]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.

[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.401]  We're good to go!
[01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:44.245]  And the jewelry industry alike.
[01:21:44.245 --> 01:21:46.106]  Protect the things you care about most.

[01:22:01.613 --> 01:22:03.935]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.935 --> 01:22:05.796]  November 30th, 2009.
[01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:07.418]  Gold opened this morning at $1173.90.
[01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:12.942]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1208.60, $604.30 for a half ounce, or $302.15 for the quarter ounce.
[01:22:12.942 --> 01:22:13.843]  That's $1208.60, $604.30, or $302.15.
[01:22:21.124 --> 01:22:34.753]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:34.753 --> 01:22:35.994]  Is this capitalism?
[01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:43.579]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:43.579 --> 01:22:44.679]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:44.679 --> 01:22:48.842]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:49.022 --> 01:22:50.124]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.124 --> 01:22:51.185]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:51.185 --> 01:22:51.386]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.386 --> 01:22:51.766]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:11.182]  We're going to go live.
[01:24:11.182 --> 01:24:14.283]  We're live now on the radio.
[01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:21.184]  We're going to simulcast at PrisonPlanet.TV in the last two and a half hours of the show today, starting in the next segment.
[01:24:21.184 --> 01:24:27.526]  So PrisonPlanet.TV members and viewers, start your engines.
[01:24:27.526 --> 01:24:30.387]  Let's go ahead and go to Pamela in Ohio.
[01:24:30.387 --> 01:24:32.648]  Pamela, you're on the air.
[01:24:32.648 --> 01:24:33.628]  Hello.
[01:24:33.628 --> 01:24:33.788]  Hi.
[01:24:34.481 --> 01:24:35.301]  Hi.
[01:24:35.301 --> 01:24:39.644]  First of all, I want to say thank you for being a watchman on the wall.
[01:24:39.644 --> 01:24:41.184]  You're sounding the alarm.
[01:24:41.184 --> 01:24:42.985]  You're blowing the trumpet.
[01:24:42.985 --> 01:24:52.510]  And I know that God is very, very pleased about that because he always says in his word, what's hidden darkness shall be exposed in the light.
[01:24:52.510 --> 01:25:03.955]  And if they ever come, like you said, if you'll keep going no matter what, just always remember about Paul and Silas being in prison and the Lord
[01:25:04.815 --> 01:25:07.877]  gave an earthquake and they were freed.
[01:25:07.877 --> 01:25:15.382]  So you have all of God's protection on you, around you, you're exposing the truth, and I thank you for that.
[01:25:15.382 --> 01:25:31.313]  The second thing is, I'm calling, I'm asking about, you know, that Vera chip, that, I think it's called RDFD or whatever it is, that chip, is that considered, do you think that is considered like the mark of the beast?
[01:25:33.075 --> 01:25:34.095]  I think it's more than that.
[01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:37.617]  I think it's a system because they don't even need a microchip.
[01:25:37.617 --> 01:25:44.139]  They have your body resonance heat scan, your individual body type.
[01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:55.283]  When you walk up to an airport scanner or the government scanning systems they're putting in and your body is scanned, they then attach your unique heat resonance fingerprint
[01:25:56.334 --> 01:26:03.058]  or digital matrix to that number and they can look right through your clothes and tell who you are even if you're in a disguise.
[01:26:03.058 --> 01:26:09.982]  They have biometrics for your walk, biometric scanners for license plates.
[01:26:09.982 --> 01:26:14.585]  This is really the total control system whether you're a Christian or not.
[01:26:14.585 --> 01:26:21.309]  This is the system that's going to be used to control and track and trace and you know I talked about this 14 years ago and get laughed at when I had government documents.
[01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:21.510]  Now
[01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:27.053]  I watched Quantum of Silence, the new James Bond movie, and the whole thing's about face scanning.
[01:26:27.053 --> 01:26:30.836]  Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen, is all about face scanning.
[01:26:30.836 --> 01:26:35.839]  You know, where they just throw it in your face now that the good guys are scanning your faces.
[01:26:35.839 --> 01:26:39.221]  But in truth, the people running the system are the bad guys.
[01:26:39.221 --> 01:26:46.026]  And so they're putting this all in place so they can oppress people, and so no one really has a way to defend themselves unless they just run
[01:26:47.412 --> 01:26:58.085]  Suicide missions, but even those will just be against the local police, who the globalists want to chew up, so they can militarize them more against the people in an us-against-them situation.
[01:26:58.085 --> 01:26:59.587]  So, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:27:00.527 --> 01:27:15.770]  And, you know, the elites are going to live out their lives in offshore reservations, controlled safe zones inside the U.S., inside high technology reservations, inside the major cities, and all of us are going to be walled off outside of that.
[01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:23.652]  It's already like that to a great extent, but this is their control grid where government facilities and corporate facilities are green zones.
[01:27:24.492 --> 01:27:33.638]  Uh, where they're safe from us, and then they can dispatch their paramilitary forces to snatch our children, to forcibly inoculate us, uh, to arrest us.
[01:27:33.638 --> 01:27:35.139]  You won't be able to buy or sell.
[01:27:35.139 --> 01:27:37.180]  This is the Homeland Security saying this.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:40.082]  If you're not in favor with them, you won't be able to buy firearms.
[01:27:40.082 --> 01:27:43.164]  The no-fly lists are gonna be expanded to most of the population.
[01:27:43.164 --> 01:27:45.625]  It'll then be a no-work, no-buy list.
[01:27:45.625 --> 01:27:48.607]  If you're homeless, you're gonna be arrested and taken to a work camp.
[01:27:48.607 --> 01:27:50.148]  That's now being announced worldwide.
[01:27:50.148 --> 01:27:51.369]  I mean, this is hell.
[01:27:52.728 --> 01:27:53.689]  That is.
[01:27:53.689 --> 01:28:07.178]  And I'm wondering, since God has not appointed us to wrath, and do you think that will be taken, you know, before, that the Christians will be taken before this?
[01:28:07.178 --> 01:28:11.922]  In other words, do you think this will happen before the Tribulation or after the Tribulation?
[01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:20.170]  Ma'am, that's why my radio show is... it's not secular, which means without God, but it's not a religious show.
[01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:23.171]  I'm a Christian, I don't hide that.
[01:28:23.171 --> 01:28:29.713]  But at the same time, I know that the Globalist, a hundred plus years ago, with Schofield and others, took over the teaching in the Bibles.
[01:28:30.633 --> 01:28:32.914]  And it's just all a complete fantasy.
[01:28:32.914 --> 01:28:45.720]  The whole Revelation and Daniel and Ezekiel and all of those prophecies are about waging war against the saints, going after the people, taking their children, poisoning them.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:51.803]  And so, you know, there is stuff in Revelations about the dead in Christ, you know, being risen.
[01:28:53.484 --> 01:29:06.392]  But the whole thing is about God's people going through this and bearing testament to the truth during the bad times and the greatest awakening and revival to the fact that there is good and evil happening during this.
[01:29:06.392 --> 01:29:07.513]  I mean, look at all the prophets.
[01:29:07.513 --> 01:29:08.514]  Look at Christ.
[01:29:08.514 --> 01:29:10.855]  They all had to go through the evil.
[01:29:12.816 --> 01:29:19.540]  A lot of German Christians were told to stand down, and that Hitler was the Antichrist, and they got killed.
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.763]  The founders were told, Romans 13, stand down to King George III.
[01:29:23.763 --> 01:29:28.526]  Christians in Cambodia were murdered en masse by Pol Pot, thinking they were about to be raptured.
[01:29:29.626 --> 01:29:32.488]  Christians in Cuba thought they were going to be raptured.
[01:29:32.488 --> 01:29:35.310]  Christians in China thought they were going to be raptured.
[01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:42.374]  And no ma'am, regardless of what's going to happen, duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[01:29:42.374 --> 01:29:51.380]  It is our responsibility, the spirit of God and life and love and goodness is not in us if we don't have a compulsion to stand up against evil.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:55.322]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.322 --> 01:29:58.004]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.771 --> 01:30:06.078]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:06.078 --> 01:30:10.604]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.604 --> 01:30:12.887]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.887 --> 01:30:14.509]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:15.551]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.771 --> 01:30:24.197]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:09.859]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:31:09.859 --> 01:31:13.221]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:31:13.221 --> 01:31:19.104]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:23.887]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:31:23.887 --> 01:31:26.228]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:31:26.408 --> 01:31:26.808]  Thank you.
[01:31:43.157 --> 01:31:43.357]  Thank you.
[01:32:00.566 --> 01:32:03.950]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:07.575]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:32:07.575 --> 01:32:12.140]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:17.747]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:32:18.027 --> 01:32:22.792]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:32:22.792 --> 01:32:26.415]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:32:26.415 --> 01:32:31.240]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:37.806]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:32:37.806 --> 01:32:39.748]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:32:40.228 --> 01:32:43.430]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:33:17.999 --> 01:33:20.702]  Central.
[01:33:20.702 --> 01:33:23.225]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:33:23.225 --> 01:33:24.126]  Eastern.
[01:33:24.126 --> 01:33:26.189]  I come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.589]  Central.
[01:33:31.735 --> 01:33:39.246]  We are now simulcasting the last two and a half hours of this radio show in living color via PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:46.557]  I want to just remind all the internet viewers that every year we've done this for five and a half years that we've had PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:48.868 --> 01:33:57.070]  You get five and a half months, is what it comes out to, free at PrisonPlanet.TV when you sign up for a year membership.
[01:33:57.070 --> 01:34:01.872]  So you pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free, or get the trial, $5.95.
[01:34:01.872 --> 01:34:08.714]  Test membership, all of my films in super high quality, like Fall of the Republic, exclusive expanded interviews.
[01:34:08.714 --> 01:34:11.975]  We flew to Phoenix to interview David Icke.
[01:34:13.644 --> 01:34:17.866]  Expanded extras like Endgame 1.5 just for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:34:17.866 --> 01:34:24.229]  You can burn and download on DivX on the regular CD that plays on most DVD players to give to people.
[01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:27.371]  It's an armory of resistance in the InfoWar.
[01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:28.271]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:34:30.632 --> 01:34:37.136]  And we are running, until they exhaust the supply, a combo special.
[01:34:37.136 --> 01:34:50.124]  We've got a whole bunch of combos just until Christmas, so you can spread the word and also support the broadcast and the filmmaking and our whole independent media operation that is entirely viewer and listener supported.
[01:34:50.124 --> 01:34:53.346]  Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[01:34:53.346 --> 01:34:58.429]  When you buy this DVD for $19.95, you get free the Obama Joker shirt.
[01:34:59.591 --> 01:35:11.439]  And there's four different messages, InfoWars.com on the back, on the front, socialism, fascism, New World Order, InfoWars.com, your choice, under Obama as the joker that the media called for banning.
[01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:12.660]  That's a limited time shirt.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:14.921]  When it's sold out, it's sold out.
[01:35:14.921 --> 01:35:16.282]  We're not going to print any more.
[01:35:16.282 --> 01:35:19.704]  So get the free t-shirt right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:19.704 --> 01:35:27.169]  There's a bunch of other combos where you can get in-game free with Fall of the Republic, where you can get reflections and warnings free with Fall of the Republic.
[01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:29.391]  We're only doing that until Christmas.
[01:35:30.011 --> 01:35:37.896]  And you may be fully awake to all this, but your friends, your family, your neighbors, if you burn them a copy of my film, which I encourage you to do, they may not watch it.
[01:35:37.896 --> 01:35:39.577]  It's just a CD you gave them.
[01:35:39.577 --> 01:35:49.203]  But if you give them A Fall of the Republic, or an Obama Deception, or an Endgame, or Reflections and Warnings, or America Freedom to Fascism that we sell, or all the other great films and books and materials, they will watch it.
[01:35:49.203 --> 01:35:49.904]  They will view it.
[01:35:50.874 --> 01:35:56.878]  So order those at infowars.com or you can also give somebody a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[01:35:56.878 --> 01:36:04.183]  Just create the username and password and give it to them in an e-card and you can have six IPs signed on at one time with your membership.
[01:36:04.183 --> 01:36:08.946]  So you can give yourself a membership and then also give it to somebody else as a membership.
[01:36:08.946 --> 01:36:11.868]  So that's our little present of truth to you.
[01:36:11.868 --> 01:36:13.209]  We are proffering this to you.
[01:36:13.209 --> 01:36:14.650]  We are offering this to you.
[01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:19.714]  We hope that you take advantage of it because people have never been this ready to awaken
[01:36:20.394 --> 01:36:22.876]  As they are now.
[01:36:22.876 --> 01:36:24.037]  Okay.
[01:36:24.037 --> 01:36:27.860]  That said, I said we're going to have wide open phones today.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.141]  No guests.
[01:36:29.141 --> 01:36:31.243]  We have some big guests coming up later in the week.
[01:36:31.243 --> 01:36:34.485]  We had Charlie Sheen on in the last week live.
[01:36:34.485 --> 01:36:37.527]  We had, of course, Jesse Ventura back on live.
[01:36:37.527 --> 01:36:40.349]  We had Lord Monckton live.
[01:36:40.349 --> 01:36:43.152]  We've got some other huge guests coming up this week.
[01:36:43.152 --> 01:36:46.134]  I'm just going to leave it at that and let them be surprises for you.
[01:36:49.304 --> 01:36:52.965]  And no, Dave Mustaine is not one of the surprise guests.
[01:36:52.965 --> 01:36:56.466]  He said when he came to Texas in December, he wanted to hook up.
[01:36:56.466 --> 01:37:03.468]  And then Craig Sandler, one of the producers we've got, said, you know, you're supposed to contact Dave Mustaine.
[01:37:03.468 --> 01:37:04.688]  And so I emailed him last week.
[01:37:04.688 --> 01:37:06.128]  He was already on the road, didn't get a response.
[01:37:06.128 --> 01:37:07.148]  So I called.
[01:37:07.148 --> 01:37:08.469]  I have a cell, but I didn't call that.
[01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:13.527]  I called his assistant up, and Mike was so nice, he goes, oh Dave's right here asleep.
[01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:14.188]  Wake up Dave!
[01:37:14.188 --> 01:37:15.870]  I said, no don't wake him up!
[01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:19.313]  And he invited me up to Dallas, but he's got to make sure he has the time.
[01:37:19.313 --> 01:37:24.538]  So I'm probably going to get a face-to-face video interview with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, who's now become a Christian.
[01:37:25.479 --> 01:37:25.799]  I think?
[01:37:43.496 --> 01:37:53.926]  Sells out stadiums of 50,000 here in the United States, 200,000 in Italy, 200,000 in Brazil, hundreds of thousands in Japan, hundreds of thousands in Russia.
[01:37:53.926 --> 01:37:58.350]  Megadeth is one of the top three heavy metal bands of all time.
[01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.492]  Probably number one or number two, they debate that.
[01:38:00.492 --> 01:38:03.455]  But globally, they are definitely the big enchilada.
[01:38:03.455 --> 01:38:08.960]  And now all those Megadeth listeners are hearing Dave Mustaine reach out to them
[01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:19.357]  And with a truly Christian message, not a Christianoid message, and with an anti-New World Order, anti-eugenics message.
[01:38:19.357 --> 01:38:22.041]  So that is so exciting.
[01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:23.563]  Okay, I want to give you
[01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:36.653]  My take on the tragic police shooting that happened yesterday in a suburb of Seattle, Washington, where four policemen, three male, one female, were ambushed, slaughtered.
[01:38:36.653 --> 01:38:41.258]  And a trend I noticed, and when I see something I just have to report it, even if it's politically incorrect.
[01:38:41.258 --> 01:38:42.279]  That's coming up.
[01:38:42.279 --> 01:38:43.881]  I want to get into the latest on ClimateGate.
[01:38:43.881 --> 01:38:45.643]  This is breaking even bigger than I thought it would.
[01:38:45.643 --> 01:38:46.384]  This is beautiful.
[01:38:48.015 --> 01:38:53.519]  What a great Christmas present to everybody who loves truth and values truth and dignity and integrity.
[01:38:53.519 --> 01:38:57.222]  A bunch of economic news as the global meltdown intensifies.
[01:38:57.222 --> 01:39:03.126]  That is all coming up and then your phone calls, Mike, Joe, Thomas, Greg, Russ, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:39:03.126 --> 01:39:06.069]  But I want to start getting to some video clips today.
[01:39:06.069 --> 01:39:08.971]  The first one is We Are Change Chicago.
[01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:14.475]  And the intro video is a clip of Al Gore on TV and then Al Gore being confronted on C-SPAN.
[01:39:16.156 --> 01:39:23.823]  And then the next clip, of course, is them live last week at one of his book signings confronting him.
[01:39:29.648 --> 01:39:35.052]  Videos like this, in the action We Are Change Chicago took, is the victory against the New World Order.
[01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:37.774]  I'll explain why and how after the clip.
[01:39:37.774 --> 01:39:40.416]  And I've got some other clips here I want to play as well.
[01:39:40.416 --> 01:39:51.365]  But for viewers and radio listeners, if you're a radio listener and aren't watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, we have the We Are Change Chicago article posted up on InfoWars.com.
[01:39:51.365 --> 01:39:53.286]  And this is the beginning of the end for these people.
[01:39:53.286 --> 01:39:56.609]  And it's totally peaceful and honorable and wonderful what they're doing.
[01:39:56.609 --> 01:39:57.350]  And I salute them.
[01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.690]  Here it is.
[01:40:01.584 --> 01:40:03.085]  Good for you, sir.
[01:40:03.085 --> 01:40:06.688]  Did you know that fluorescent light bulbs last ten times longer than regular ones?
[01:40:06.688 --> 01:40:09.711]  Yep, and they only use one quarter of the power.
[01:40:09.711 --> 01:40:14.295]  But if we're going to solve the climate crisis, we've got to change more than the light bulbs in the windows.
[01:40:14.295 --> 01:40:19.960]  We've got to change the laws and the policies through collective political action on a large scale.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:26.625]  Kenneth, encourage your lawmakers to take action and recycle everything, including jokes.
[01:40:26.625 --> 01:40:27.286]  I'm sorry, sir, what?
[01:40:30.708 --> 01:40:32.130]  A whale is in trouble.
[01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:33.832]  I have to go.
[01:40:33.832 --> 01:40:41.140]  Congressman, you began by denying that there is a consensus on the science.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:43.183]  There is a consensus on the science.
[01:40:43.183 --> 01:40:50.651]  You must have been listening to our testimony that we've had for the last few days with dozens of experts that have come in who have given completely different views.
[01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:55.735]  So I would encourage you to go back and look at the testimony that this committee's heard.
[01:40:55.735 --> 01:41:01.759]  There are people who still believe that the moon landing was staged on a movie lot in Arizona.
[01:41:01.759 --> 01:41:02.579]  This guy's preaching.
[01:41:02.579 --> 01:41:06.702]  Of course, we'll see that John Coleman, he won't debate anybody.
[01:41:06.702 --> 01:41:10.404]  The IPCC isn't really a bunch of scientists, it's a bunch of E1 globalists.
[01:41:10.404 --> 01:41:12.185]  Are you guys looking into this stuff?
[01:41:19.882 --> 01:41:22.965]  Are you guys allowed to cover things like this or not?
[01:41:22.965 --> 01:41:26.508]  Would your bosses let you tell the real story about real Americans out here?
[01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:34.552]  Vice President Al Gore was in Chicago today to sign copies of his new book, Our Choice.
[01:41:34.552 --> 01:41:38.233]  It was a long line of supporters at the Borders Bookstore on State Street.
[01:41:38.233 --> 01:41:43.636]  Our Choice is a follow-up to Gore's Academy Award-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
[01:41:43.636 --> 01:41:46.997]  Gore has championed environmental issues for many years.
[01:41:46.997 --> 01:41:52.119]  His book is described as a call to action and answers many of the questions posed by the film.
[01:41:52.119 --> 01:41:57.021]  Gore was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work with climate change.
[01:42:07.924 --> 01:42:08.785]  We're good to go.
[01:42:22.884 --> 01:42:24.206]  This is a eugenics operation!
[01:42:24.206 --> 01:42:24.607]  Don't touch me!
[01:42:24.607 --> 01:42:25.808]  This is a eugenics operation!
[01:42:25.808 --> 01:42:26.930]  This is a eugenics program!
[01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:28.712]  This is a New World Order!
[01:42:28.712 --> 01:42:29.834]  Wake up people!
[01:42:29.834 --> 01:42:30.315]  Wake up!
[01:42:30.315 --> 01:42:30.996]  Wake up!
[01:42:30.996 --> 01:42:32.478]  This is a New World Order!
[01:42:39.247 --> 01:42:40.848]  Can I give you that, Mr. Gloria?
[01:42:40.848 --> 01:42:47.431]  It's your science that shows that 31,000 scientists are speaking out against your eugenics-global-globe agenda, sir.
[01:42:47.431 --> 01:42:52.254]  The New World Order will fail, and we realize that this is against our sovereignty.
[01:42:52.254 --> 01:42:53.414]  I have a First Amendment right.
[01:42:53.414 --> 01:42:55.255]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[01:42:55.255 --> 01:42:56.236]  I am leaving.
[01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:56.816]  I am leaving.
[01:42:56.816 --> 01:42:58.717]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[01:42:58.717 --> 01:43:00.638]  I have a First Amendment right.
[01:43:00.638 --> 01:43:03.699]  This man wants to create a centralized global government.
[01:43:03.699 --> 01:43:04.480]  31,000 scientists.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.061]  That man is... This is Nazi fascism.
[01:43:10.501 --> 01:43:12.442]  Any comments on ClimateGate?
[01:43:12.442 --> 01:43:14.243]  The emails that prove it's a scam?
[01:43:14.243 --> 01:43:15.444]  It's a farce?
[01:43:15.444 --> 01:43:16.725]  Global warming is a joke?
[01:43:16.725 --> 01:43:17.705]  Any comment?
[01:43:17.705 --> 01:43:19.326]  Comment on ClimateGate?
[01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.007]  ClimateGate?
[01:43:20.007 --> 01:43:21.167]  First Amendment rights here!
[01:43:21.167 --> 01:43:22.328]  ClimateGate!
[01:43:22.328 --> 01:43:23.609]  ClimateGate!
[01:43:23.609 --> 01:43:25.050]  Research ClimateGate!
[01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:26.310]  This guy's a fraud!
[01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:27.131]  It's a scam!
[01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:32.653]  They are trying to institute a global government through a carbon tax!
[01:43:32.653 --> 01:43:34.694]  This guy's working on a carbon tax!
[01:43:34.694 --> 01:43:35.955]  That's all it is!
[01:43:35.955 --> 01:43:37.356]  It's global government!
[01:43:37.356 --> 01:43:40.857]  There are 30,000 scientists trying to sue this guy!
[01:43:40.857 --> 01:43:45.279]  John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel, is suing this bum!
[01:43:45.279 --> 01:43:47.941]  You're all in line for this bum!
[01:43:47.941 --> 01:43:49.141]  It's a global government!
[01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:50.442]  Get your hands off me!
[01:43:50.442 --> 01:43:51.722]  First Amendment rights!
[01:43:51.722 --> 01:43:52.963]  Get your hands off me!
[01:43:55.794 --> 01:43:57.055]  You talk about carbon polluters.
[01:43:57.055 --> 01:43:58.316]  You talk about them.
[01:43:58.316 --> 01:44:11.966]  It's my understanding that back in 1997, when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[01:44:11.966 --> 01:44:13.107]  Is that accurate?
[01:44:13.107 --> 01:44:14.048]  Is it inaccurate?
[01:44:14.048 --> 01:44:14.808]  It's been reported.
[01:44:14.808 --> 01:44:16.049]  I don't know.
[01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:38.051]  Unbelievable.
[01:44:38.051 --> 01:44:40.833]  This is the spirit of victory.
[01:44:40.833 --> 01:44:45.856]  This is the spirit that will defeat the tyranny.
[01:44:45.856 --> 01:44:56.682]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that population, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill and these dangers are caused by human intervention.
[01:44:58.272 --> 01:45:11.087]  If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don't know me.
[01:45:11.087 --> 01:45:13.149]  Thank you!
[01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:14.050]  Happy Thanksgiving!
[01:45:20.542 --> 01:45:20.962]  Yes.
[01:45:20.962 --> 01:45:30.129]  Everywhere he goes, inside, outside.
[01:45:30.129 --> 01:45:30.690]  Traitor.
[01:45:45.287 --> 01:45:47.469]  This is how tyranny falls.
[01:45:47.469 --> 01:45:50.132]  This is true revolution.
[01:45:50.132 --> 01:45:53.596]  Oh, I just want to hug We Are Change Ohio and Chicago.
[01:45:53.596 --> 01:45:56.238]  Now they're at his car.
[01:45:56.238 --> 01:46:02.084]  Yeah!
[01:46:02.084 --> 01:46:03.406]  Running that rat to ground.
[01:46:09.002 --> 01:46:15.784]  Man, ladies and gentlemen, everywhere he goes, bigger crowds, more people confronting him.
[01:46:15.784 --> 01:46:16.824]  Climategate.
[01:46:16.824 --> 01:46:21.506]  They had multiple people split up so as they grabbed one group, another group would activate.
[01:46:21.506 --> 01:46:23.186]  No way to stop this.
[01:46:23.186 --> 01:46:25.527]  All those hundreds of fools there at the book signing.
[01:46:26.047 --> 01:46:27.648]  That the mainstream media have been promoting.
[01:46:27.648 --> 01:46:34.694]  Gore's been all over mainline TV, dramas, sitcoms, promoting his lies, telling people to pass laws.
[01:46:34.694 --> 01:46:36.916]  This is government paid for propaganda.
[01:46:36.916 --> 01:46:42.260]  Your tax money on TV with him brainwashing the public, making him this big celebrity.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:46.324]  Just like they made Obama this celebrity to sell all this garbage.
[01:46:46.324 --> 01:46:50.167]  Just like they made Bush a celebrity with TV shows to push the police state.
[01:46:52.074 --> 01:47:05.398]  Everywhere he goes and now the link between man-made global warming and the global carbon tax and global government and eugenics is now being made and everyone is starting to talk about it.
[01:47:05.398 --> 01:47:11.881]  Everyone is starting to talk about eco-science written by the White House science czar calling for exterminating the majority of the population.
[01:47:11.881 --> 01:47:16.562]  The signal is getting out, the truth, the full magnitude is now coming out.
[01:47:16.562 --> 01:47:18.743]  Thanks to you, the listeners of this radio show.
[01:47:19.483 --> 01:47:26.157]  And every one of you, I mean look at Luke Hradowski, 19 years old, gets kicked out of 9-11 Truth in New York because he wanted to go after the New World Order.
[01:47:27.699 --> 01:47:32.183]  I told him, I said, man, go start your own organization, we're gonna support you.
[01:47:32.183 --> 01:47:33.924]  Other people picked up on it.
[01:47:33.924 --> 01:47:49.176]  The zenith of all of this, or the inception, was our listeners flocking to the term We Are Change and Luke, spreading these organizations everywhere that don't have leaders, that don't have a classical organization.
[01:47:49.176 --> 01:47:54.080]  It's an idea, not left, not right, but freedom and truth and honor.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:48:00.343]  And this is the true populism, the true constitutional populism that will defeat the New World Order.
[01:48:00.343 --> 01:48:05.365]  You're watching nails in the coffin of the New World Order when you see video like that.
[01:48:06.462 --> 01:48:09.266]  This is just so unbelievably powerful.
[01:48:09.266 --> 01:48:11.188]  And I wrote some other notes during that video.
[01:48:11.188 --> 01:48:25.326]  Notice Al Gore will not debate Lord Monckton or the founder of the Weather Channel or all these meteorologists of the 30 plus thousand top scientists against the UN's 2,500 only less than 100 are real climatologists and they've all been caught in emails as fraud lying.
[01:48:27.423 --> 01:48:31.428]  They are desperate to keep the lid on this, but the lid is already blown wide open.
[01:48:31.428 --> 01:48:37.616]  The genie's out of the bottle, the horse left the barn a long time ago, but the more they try to cover this up, the more they try to hold it down.
[01:48:37.616 --> 01:48:40.980]  I mean, oh, just the way they did that was perfect.
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:42.583]  I salute you.
[01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:44.104]  I thank you.
[01:48:44.104 --> 01:48:45.326]  I thank all of you.
[01:48:46.567 --> 01:48:51.848]  This is just so wonderful, and everybody's looking up online, we're mentioning on air where Al Gore is next.
[01:48:51.848 --> 01:48:56.009]  In fact, let's look up Al Gore, his itinerary.
[01:48:56.009 --> 01:49:00.490]  And I know they're not even really listing that on his site now, hoping people won't show up, they just locally promote it.
[01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:11.852]  Doesn't matter, we have listeners, we have activists, we have freedom lovers everywhere that understand that Al Gore isn't screwing up, Al Gore isn't dumb, Al Gore is an environmentalist, wacko, tree hugger.
[01:49:11.852 --> 01:49:14.253]  That would be okay, because we do have real environmental problems.
[01:49:14.893 --> 01:49:17.896]  Al Gore is a eugenicist openly.
[01:49:17.896 --> 01:49:25.282]  I was reading the Maury Strong UN quotes that are in the film from the Club of Rome where they said we're going to make humankind the enemy.
[01:49:25.282 --> 01:49:27.644]  In fact, cue that video back up for me.
[01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:29.225]  It's about three minutes till the end.
[01:49:29.966 --> 01:49:35.972]  Where it shows the quote, I want to read that full quote as we go out to break to people because I didn't have time to read it all.
[01:49:35.972 --> 01:49:42.938]  Where they say, we are going to make humanity the enemy and the government will direct the war against humanity.
[01:49:42.938 --> 01:49:52.327]  This is a war economy run by the government, run by the internal police forces, the Stasi forces they've set up to carry out eugenics.
[01:49:52.327 --> 01:49:53.689]  That's what Hitler was.
[01:49:54.921 --> 01:50:11.236]  And if the truth about this gets out, if anybody reads what Al Gore actually says, or Maury Strong, or all these other globalists, John P. Holdren, if people actually read what they've said, what they've done, it is over for these people.
[01:50:11.943 --> 01:50:13.124]  Here, I'll read the quote.
[01:50:13.124 --> 01:50:18.609]  The first global revolution, 1991, published by the Club of Rome, a globalist think tank.
[01:50:18.609 --> 01:50:28.779]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that population, the threat of global warming, and water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill.
[01:50:28.779 --> 01:50:31.421]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention.
[01:50:31.421 --> 01:50:34.344]  The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.
[01:50:34.344 --> 01:50:35.445]  And they go on to say,
[01:50:36.926 --> 01:50:46.012]  That they're going to use fake terror to take our rights on one end, and fake environmentalism to take our resources on the other, to make us totally bankrupt and dependent on them.
[01:50:46.012 --> 01:50:59.182]  They want you dependent, not so they can enslave you, but so they can kill you with forced inoculations, with poisons in the water, like John P. Holdren calls for, the White House science czar, who's also manipulating the weather.
[01:50:59.182 --> 01:51:00.703]  He admits that to the Associated Press.
[01:51:01.283 --> 01:51:02.583]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.583 --> 01:51:08.185]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.185 --> 01:51:13.186]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.186 --> 01:51:18.768]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.768 --> 01:51:23.449]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.991 --> 01:51:31.094]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.094 --> 01:51:32.214]  And here's the best part.

[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.281]  To have a sex life again?

[01:53:43.041 --> 01:53:44.662]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:23.604]  Somebody needs to create a basic site like Expose Gore, Stop Gore, Arrest Gore.
[01:54:26.158 --> 01:54:35.341]  And list all the videos of people confronting him, the articles of people confronting him, and track doing web searches because Gore won't list where he's going because he's worried about this.
[01:54:35.341 --> 01:54:37.142]  He pulled it about a month ago.
[01:54:37.142 --> 01:54:40.323]  But you can still do Google searches and find out where he's going to be speaking.
[01:54:40.323 --> 01:54:48.886]  They only propagandize locally the media to get everybody to his events so he can indoctrinate them into his new religion, our choice, mass murder and tyranny, or freedom.
[01:54:48.886 --> 01:54:49.626]  He wants tyranny.
[01:54:51.778 --> 01:54:57.660]  That way I could link to it and get all of our listeners to go to these events.
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:58.800]  But it's already happening.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:05.922]  I mean, but if we start publicizing where he's going, there won't be hundreds, as the media has reported, in some cases protesting him.
[01:55:05.922 --> 01:55:07.023]  There will be thousands!
[01:55:11.505 --> 01:55:17.414]  Oh man, I wish Glenn Beck would do something effective like this and have people stand out in the rain.
[01:55:17.414 --> 01:55:25.927]  And I'm not saying that's bad, but we need to really have thousands of mini-demonstrations because those then take over all the TV reports, all the print reports,
[01:55:26.548 --> 01:55:28.451]  And expose him for what he really is.
[01:55:28.451 --> 01:55:39.024]  And this is, again, the amount of press this gets when 10-15 people go to a book signing, go in, confront him, mess up his whole agenda, expose the fraud, bring up ClimateGate.
[01:55:39.024 --> 01:55:41.887]  What you saw in that video should be a blueprint of how to do this.
[01:55:42.728 --> 01:55:48.311]  And then yell and scream at him that he's a traitor and a liar and a fraud and a criminal with Ken Lay as he leaves.
[01:55:48.311 --> 01:55:52.052]  Let me tell you, he will suspend his tour very, very quickly if this continues.
[01:55:52.052 --> 01:55:56.234]  And he needs to be in jail for all his crimes.
[01:55:56.234 --> 01:56:00.036]  And this is how you get justice, is going, there's the criminal, there's the bad man.
[01:56:01.445 --> 01:56:04.208]  Now I want to play this video.
[01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:08.613]  This is not the winning 20 Minutes with the President video from Charlie Sheen's contest.
[01:56:08.613 --> 01:56:11.356]  This is the same guy that made that winning video.
[01:56:11.356 --> 01:56:12.898]  And I love the little pearls of wisdom.
[01:56:12.898 --> 01:56:19.305]  He breaks down the fraud in this graph, this little two-minute video, titled The Global Warming Fraud.
[01:56:21.618 --> 01:56:22.899]  The global warming hoax.
[01:56:22.899 --> 01:56:25.620]  It's up on InfoWars.com if you want to watch it.
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:27.841]  But here is that video.
[01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:33.664]  If you haven't heard the latest, global warming has been a scam from the get-go.
[01:56:33.664 --> 01:56:46.411]  All along they have been setting up this global carbon tax as a huge fraud on the American people and the people of the world in order for the UN to move into global governance.
[01:56:47.369 --> 01:56:50.570]  They want to control every aspect of our lives.
[01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:57.453]  So if you're a liberty, freedom-loving American, you're gonna get screwed over just like everybody else in the rest of the world.
[01:56:57.453 --> 01:57:04.416]  Now, I decided that I wanted to take a minute to go over the hugest scams they've been perpetrating over the last 10 years.
[01:57:04.416 --> 01:57:08.377]  So why don't we take a quick jump and take a look at some of these, okay?
[01:57:08.377 --> 01:57:11.498]  Let's start with 9-11.
[01:57:11.498 --> 01:57:15.840]  60% of the commissioners say the official story isn't true because that ship is sinking.
[01:57:16.823 --> 01:57:17.903]  War on Terror.
[01:57:17.903 --> 01:57:22.865]  Cooked up decades ago to replace the Cold War to keep the military machine moving.
[01:57:22.865 --> 01:57:23.925]  Afghanistan.
[01:57:23.925 --> 01:57:27.107]  Not about Al Qaeda because CIA created Al Qaeda.
[01:57:27.107 --> 01:57:32.448]  It's about the Caspian Pipeline and protecting the opium poppy fields.
[01:57:32.448 --> 01:57:33.229]  Iraq.
[01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:34.989]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[01:57:34.989 --> 01:57:36.970]  Need I say more?
[01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:38.210]  Housing bubble.
[01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:40.671]  Real estate only goes up in price, right?
[01:57:40.671 --> 01:57:41.271]  Wrong.
[01:57:41.271 --> 01:57:42.172]  They lied to you.
[01:57:42.172 --> 01:57:45.693]  Now the banks own all the property in this country off of your bankruptcy.
[01:57:46.581 --> 01:57:47.902]  Banker bailout.
[01:57:47.902 --> 01:57:53.587]  Oh, we need the money to save the banks so we can buy up these toxic assets and start lending again.
[01:57:53.587 --> 01:57:54.748]  That's a lie.
[01:57:54.748 --> 01:58:00.592]  They took the money to buy up other smaller corporations and phase out other banks and take control.
[01:58:00.592 --> 01:58:01.974]  Swine flu.
[01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:03.355]  This is insane.
[01:58:03.355 --> 01:58:05.176]  These guys are crazy.
[01:58:05.176 --> 01:58:08.319]  A designer flu created in a lab.
[01:58:08.319 --> 01:58:09.860]  Global warming.
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:14.544]  The granddaddy of them all that they were going to use to institute global governance.
[01:58:15.034 --> 01:58:16.815]  I can't wait for this Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:58:16.815 --> 01:58:21.479]  I hope you guys are on top of this because all of this is a lie.
[01:58:21.479 --> 01:58:23.500]  All of it.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:28.584]  If you want your freedom and you want your liberties, you need to take a look at these and seriously think about it.
[01:58:28.584 --> 01:58:35.449]  You're being lied to and the mainstream media is complicit and they should all be charged with criminal felonies.
[01:58:35.449 --> 01:58:38.912]  They need to be tried as criminals and brought to justice.
[01:58:43.004 --> 01:58:45.609]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.609 --> 01:58:48.775]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:51.616 --> 01:58:54.617]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.617 --> 01:58:59.960]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:02.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.003]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:07.003 --> 01:59:08.183]  How much do you want?
[01:59:08.183 --> 01:59:09.304]  When do you want it?
[01:59:09.304 --> 01:59:11.204]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:11.204 --> 01:59:12.265]  When will you need it?
[01:59:12.265 --> 01:59:14.466]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.466 --> 01:59:15.806]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.806 --> 01:59:17.127]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:17.327 --> 01:59:22.593]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.593 --> 01:59:26.177]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:26.177 --> 01:59:30.002]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:30.002 --> 01:59:31.243]  How much will you need?
[01:59:31.243 --> 01:59:32.144]  We don't know.
[01:59:32.144 --> 01:59:33.246]  How much do you want?
[01:59:33.246 --> 01:59:34.187]  All you can get.
[01:59:34.187 --> 01:59:34.988]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:35.248 --> 01:59:38.309]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:38.309 --> 01:59:40.550]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:41.550]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:42.710]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.710 --> 01:59:44.551]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:07.087]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.087 --> 02:00:08.849]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.849 --> 02:00:10.612]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.612 --> 02:00:12.194]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.194 --> 02:00:13.116]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.116 --> 02:00:17.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.943 --> 02:00:21.988]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.266 --> 02:00:25.487]  I start thinking about the ClimateGate emails.
[02:00:25.487 --> 02:00:29.009]  We're only a week and a half into this and it's devastating the New World Order.
[02:00:29.009 --> 02:00:39.654]  The key to their whole global taxing system, the heart of the New World Order neo-feudalistic surf eugenics grid being exposed.
[02:00:39.654 --> 02:00:47.458]  I think about Al Gore being eloquently shouted down as a criminal, as a fraud, as a eugenicist kingpin everywhere he goes.
[02:00:47.458 --> 02:00:48.499]  It just makes me happy.
[02:00:54.241 --> 02:01:01.164]  You know, we've done so much in this audience teaching people how much power they have and showing them how to take action.
[02:01:01.164 --> 02:01:04.506]  And I'm not giving myself credit for this, even though we deserve a lot of it.
[02:01:04.506 --> 02:01:09.088]  I'm trying to show people the power they have and the effect we're having and how much this could grow.
[02:01:09.088 --> 02:01:11.489]  I mean, you think things have grown in resistance.
[02:01:11.489 --> 02:01:15.891]  We've only begun the parabolic rate straight up.
[02:01:15.891 --> 02:01:17.552]  Up, up, and away.
[02:01:17.552 --> 02:01:18.693]  In, through, and beyond.
[02:01:22.659 --> 02:01:31.084]  I mean, I'm going to keep driving and pushing and hammering as hard as I can, but at this point, I could pretty much walk away from this.
[02:01:31.084 --> 02:01:39.710]  And what we've done just in this audience, with this great audience taking action, is a serious blow to the New World Order.
[02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:42.272]  So many people have shattered the left-right paradigm.
[02:01:42.272 --> 02:01:44.213]  They understand the globalist system.
[02:01:44.213 --> 02:01:45.854]  They've read their documents.
[02:01:45.854 --> 02:01:48.796]  The explosive growth curve of knowledge is now happening.
[02:01:48.796 --> 02:01:52.078]  I know where that leads, because I've gone down that road myself.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:02:03.262]  People are becoming enlightened right now, and I can feel the spirit of victory and liberty and freedom rising.
[02:02:03.262 --> 02:02:04.863]  Man!
[02:02:04.863 --> 02:02:06.743]  Surf's up, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:02:06.743 --> 02:02:08.103]  Catch the wave!
[02:02:08.103 --> 02:02:12.544]  Fightin' the New World Order!
[02:02:12.544 --> 02:02:18.786]  Oh man, I'm literally having endorphin right now, which I rarely get endorphin rushes on political issues because I'm just so focused.
[02:02:19.574 --> 02:02:29.422]  But, I mean, all these years, 14 years fighting him, I can't imagine what the adrenaline rush is like for G. Edward Griffin, by the way, who Thursday is going to be in studio with us.
[02:02:29.422 --> 02:02:32.884]  I can't imagine what it's like for people like Bob Chapman.
[02:02:32.884 --> 02:02:40.090]  You know, Charlie Sheen and I talk about the incredible rush we get doing the right thing.
[02:02:40.090 --> 02:02:47.195]  What was that quote that Chris Garcia, winner of the 20 Minutes with the President contest, what was that quote?
[02:02:47.195 --> 02:02:48.156]  He quoted me about
[02:02:50.882 --> 02:02:52.643]  There's no rush like fightin' tyranny.
[02:02:52.643 --> 02:02:55.405]  I mean, that's not my exact quote.
[02:02:55.405 --> 02:03:05.611]  Can't remember my own quote, because this stuff just comes out of me, but... Oh, man, I want to... I need to make it... There's no high like fightin' tyranny.
[02:03:05.611 --> 02:03:13.876]  Yeah, that's not the exact quote.
[02:03:13.876 --> 02:03:14.516]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[02:03:14.516 --> 02:03:16.177]  It's in the interview with him.
[02:03:17.779 --> 02:03:20.041]  From Charlie Sheen yesterday.
[02:03:20.041 --> 02:03:23.144]  But it's almost more exhausting having this much exhilaration.
[02:03:25.492 --> 02:03:29.054]  Because they're just piles of evil, piles of evidence that these are criminals.
[02:03:29.054 --> 02:03:40.561]  But we'll continue to chronicle their criminal activities like the Founding Fathers did in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War in 1775-1776 with their committees of correspondence.
[02:03:40.561 --> 02:03:48.785]  But we're now beginning to transfer and transition away from just exposing them to the public knows they're a bunch of crooks.
[02:03:48.785 --> 02:03:50.066]  How do we bring these people down?
[02:03:50.066 --> 02:03:52.488]  Well, you go out and confront them everywhere, you shout them down.
[02:03:53.228 --> 02:03:54.289]  You expose them.
[02:03:54.289 --> 02:03:58.133]  You wake up the sheeple that aren't awake, because they're ready to be awakened right now.
[02:03:58.133 --> 02:04:04.359]  I want to go to Mike, Joe, Thomas, Dan, Mike, and others.
[02:04:04.359 --> 02:04:06.341]  They just all ask great questions.
[02:04:06.341 --> 02:04:09.063]  Probing questions that are exhausting to answer, but I'm going to do it.
[02:04:09.063 --> 02:04:14.789]  I mean, I'm really exhausted right now, but it feels like I just played a football game and we won.
[02:04:14.789 --> 02:04:16.350]  And, uh...
[02:04:21.004 --> 02:04:25.888]  I'm meeting my cheerleader girlfriend in the parking lot, you know.
[02:04:25.888 --> 02:04:30.892]  But the battle, the battle, the battle isn't over, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:30.892 --> 02:04:32.914]  We're just beginning to win victories.
[02:04:32.914 --> 02:04:35.296]  We're still bloodied and in deep trouble.
[02:04:35.296 --> 02:04:38.098]  And we better treat this like it's life and death, because it is.
[02:04:38.098 --> 02:04:39.460]  But that's the victory!
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:42.622]  The people are starting to figure out, this is eugenics we're facing!
[02:04:42.622 --> 02:04:44.324]  This is mass Nazism!
[02:04:44.324 --> 02:04:45.485]  This is New World Order!
[02:04:47.315 --> 02:04:55.860]  They're really starting to get just how monumental and big this is!
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:05:00.964]  For all of you out there fighting tyranny, I salute you!
[02:05:00.964 --> 02:05:06.287]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:06.287 --> 02:05:08.368]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:05:08.368 --> 02:05:10.810]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:10.810 --> 02:05:13.091]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:13.091 --> 02:05:14.712]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:14.712 --> 02:05:15.753]  There is a solution.
[02:05:15.973 --> 02:05:24.400]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:06:00.828 --> 02:06:07.810]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.090]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:09.910]  It's very real.
[02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:13.792]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:06:13.792 --> 02:06:18.273]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:05.155]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.155 --> 02:07:06.056]  Number one.
[02:07:06.056 --> 02:07:09.498]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.498 --> 02:07:10.358]  Number two.
[02:07:10.358 --> 02:07:15.241]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:15.982]  It's true.
[02:07:15.982 --> 02:07:20.545]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.845 --> 02:07:21.666]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.666 --> 02:07:25.268]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.268 --> 02:07:29.171]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.171 --> 02:07:29.972]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.972 --> 02:07:32.733]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.733 --> 02:07:36.416]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.416 --> 02:07:37.217]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.217 --> 02:07:41.360]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:46.123]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.403 --> 02:07:50.566]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.566 --> 02:07:52.347]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.347 --> 02:07:54.609]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.609 --> 02:08:02.915]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:02.915 --> 02:08:09.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:12.542]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.965 --> 02:08:23.548]  Our country, and much of the world, was captured by the global banking syndicate a long time ago.
[02:08:23.548 --> 02:08:32.791]  But now the people are awakening to the fact that we are occupied by a criminal banking elite that controls both political parties.
[02:08:32.791 --> 02:08:37.112]  So whatever political party's out of power, they will oppose the New World Order, but only on the surface.
[02:08:37.112 --> 02:08:45.255]  And whatever political party's in power, they will continue whatever agenda the last party had, with different political window dressing to create the illusion of choice.
[02:08:47.605 --> 02:08:55.808]  But to see the public shattering this illusion and to see it like a wild brush fire raging, as Thomas Jefferson talked about, is exhilarating.
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:02.663]  I have never gotten a comprehensive list of We Are Change groups and other groups.
[02:09:02.663 --> 02:09:07.327]  They're always contacting us and I have such limited staff, we never save their numbers or info.
[02:09:07.327 --> 02:09:12.430]  I know I've had the Colorado We Are Change on, we've had Florida We Are Change on that have been confronting Al Gore.
[02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:15.552]  We've had Chicago We Are Change, Ohio on in the past.
[02:09:15.552 --> 02:09:18.494]  Then we've got to look for their numbers and emails and we can't find them.
[02:09:18.494 --> 02:09:27.160]  If you're We Are Change and I want to get them on this week, I want to get Luke on with them, do like an hour and a half with the We Are Change groups that have been confronting Al Gore.
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.041]  I know Luke's number, obviously.
[02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:36.282]  I want to get 5, 6, 7, 8 people on to talk about strategy and future operations.
[02:09:36.282 --> 02:09:39.322]  So email Craig at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:39.322 --> 02:09:40.363]  I've got Craig on this.
[02:09:40.363 --> 02:09:41.543]  We get your numbers and emails.
[02:09:41.543 --> 02:09:42.743]  We can stay in contact with you.
[02:09:42.743 --> 02:09:47.144]  Because what happens is you call us, you email us, and then I think a week later, how do I find their number?
[02:09:47.144 --> 02:09:51.145]  And there's literally 20,000 emails in a week and a half, and I'm trying to find them.
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:04.365]  It's kind of like we're kicking the New World Order's hind end in, but their political bodies are stacking up so high we can barely find room to fight because there's so many of them.
[02:10:04.365 --> 02:10:12.029]  All right, I said I'm going to cover all this news, but I also said I was to take your call.
[02:10:12.029 --> 02:10:15.291]  So let's continue with your calls right now.
[02:10:15.291 --> 02:10:17.232]  Mike in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:10:17.232 --> 02:10:19.554]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:10:19.554 --> 02:10:19.854]  Hey, buddy.
[02:10:20.868 --> 02:10:22.029]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:10:22.029 --> 02:10:22.829]  Good.
[02:10:22.829 --> 02:10:24.751]  It's an honor.
[02:10:24.751 --> 02:10:32.557]  I just want to say that the Lyron Chief is going to be in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Friday, December 4th.
[02:10:32.557 --> 02:10:40.503]  He's doing his White House to Main Street tour, and I just hope that maybe some of the listeners, like we are, change.
[02:10:40.503 --> 02:10:47.067]  I hope they show up, and we get some people down there to maybe, you know, he's supposed to be there all day.
[02:10:47.067 --> 02:10:48.228]  Details are a little sketchy.
[02:10:48.228 --> 02:10:49.069]  I'm trying to figure out
[02:10:49.724 --> 02:10:55.926]  You know, what his itinerary is going to be, but... And remember, he said he wasn't going to Copenhagen, but now he is.
[02:10:55.926 --> 02:10:56.947]  I know.
[02:10:56.947 --> 02:11:03.089]  They always do that to kill opposition so nobody shows up, then he still shows up himself.
[02:11:03.089 --> 02:11:12.312]  Well, I hope he's going to show up in Allentown, because I'm going down there, you know, and I hope some people show up with some signs and, you know, call him the liar that he is.
[02:11:12.312 --> 02:11:15.254]  He's got his little press conference tomorrow.
[02:11:15.254 --> 02:11:18.035]  I mean, there's so much that you can get this guy on, it's not even funny.
[02:11:18.035 --> 02:11:19.015]  You know, Copenhagen.
[02:11:19.997 --> 02:11:21.619]  No jobs.
[02:11:21.619 --> 02:11:22.379]  We're losing our houses.
[02:11:22.379 --> 02:11:24.981]  The wars.
[02:11:24.981 --> 02:11:26.322]  Keeping the Patriot Act.
[02:11:26.322 --> 02:11:28.564]  Expanding secret arrest and torture.
[02:11:28.564 --> 02:11:29.945]  Warrantless wiretapping.
[02:11:29.945 --> 02:11:33.828]  Hiring nothing but lobbyists.
[02:11:33.828 --> 02:11:37.751]  Spending more money than all presidents before him combined in less than one year.
[02:11:37.751 --> 02:11:45.116]  I thought that was hard to do with Bush doing it in four years or eight years, you know?
[02:11:45.116 --> 02:11:46.417]  But yeah, December 4th.
[02:11:47.777 --> 02:11:48.877]  Allentown, Pennsylvania.
[02:11:48.877 --> 02:11:50.758]  People show up.
[02:11:50.758 --> 02:11:51.738]  God bless you, sir.
[02:11:51.738 --> 02:11:52.539]  Take care.
[02:11:52.539 --> 02:11:56.620]  And there'll be a lot of people out there protesting him, but don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:12:05.923]  Just get out there, and if you're one person, a minority of one is a majority morally, and you'll end up being in the paper.
[02:12:05.923 --> 02:12:11.445]  Again, if we don't go out and confront these liars, they have the field to themselves.
[02:12:11.445 --> 02:12:13.005]  Resistance is victory.
[02:12:13.005 --> 02:12:15.586]  I hate to sound like a broken record here, but
[02:12:17.387 --> 02:12:20.029]  Joe in Illinois, you're on the air, Joe.
[02:12:20.029 --> 02:12:21.590]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:12:21.590 --> 02:12:27.293]  What did you think of that audio slash video we just played of Al Gore being routed like the pig he is?
[02:12:27.293 --> 02:12:28.294]  Hey, God bless.
[02:12:28.294 --> 02:12:30.115]  We are Chicago, those brothers.
[02:12:30.115 --> 02:12:33.157]  I want to get with them next time they do something like that.
[02:12:33.157 --> 02:12:34.518]  Yes, that's how it works.
[02:12:34.518 --> 02:12:35.919]  Join with them.
[02:12:35.919 --> 02:12:36.899]  Yeah.
[02:12:36.899 --> 02:12:45.645]  But anyway, I'm a first time caller, longtime listener, and I've kind of took all the knowledge I've gained from listening to your show.
[02:12:46.337 --> 02:12:50.620]  And put it in the form of this, uh, poetic literature.
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:55.524]  Feel free to use it, or even, you said Dave Mustaine from Megadeth?
[02:12:55.524 --> 02:12:59.607]  I think he would be down with these lyrics that I got here.
[02:12:59.607 --> 02:13:00.448]  Are you ready?
[02:13:00.448 --> 02:13:01.609]  Lay it on me!
[02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:03.911]  Alright, it's called Rulers.
[02:13:03.911 --> 02:13:08.354]  Rulers want to rule the world in the name of the moon and the sun.
[02:13:08.354 --> 02:13:12.477]  In the name of this star, Ishtar, Red Star, Dog Star.
[02:13:12.477 --> 02:13:14.579]  In the name of Mars and Jupiter.
[02:13:14.579 --> 02:13:16.040]  They can't get any stupider.
[02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:17.311]  We're good to go.
[02:13:47.059 --> 02:13:54.705]  CIA, OTO, FBI, NWO, ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX.
[02:13:54.705 --> 02:13:56.947]  That's 666, don't you know?
[02:13:56.947 --> 02:14:00.130]  Three-digit code, that's how they roll.
[02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:05.354]  H1N1, HIV, MF-MF59, and LSD.
[02:14:05.354 --> 02:14:08.617]  Hormones in the water, poison in the air.
[02:14:08.617 --> 02:14:12.280]  Mercury in the vaccines, and toxins everywhere.
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.003]  Places called Bohemian Grove, or the Thousand Points of Light.
[02:14:16.573 --> 02:14:21.136]  It's where they meet with their God to plot their schemes of blight.
[02:14:21.136 --> 02:14:30.322]  They placed their credos at the crossroads in plain sight for all to see their evil plans of ruling the world and destroying humanity.
[02:14:30.322 --> 02:14:35.785]  These are the places they bestowed their title, Masters, 33rd degree.
[02:14:35.785 --> 02:14:41.128]  But the light for which they sold their souls was so blinding they could no longer see.
[02:14:41.128 --> 02:14:45.511]  Now they're empty, heartless, broken vessels to which Satan owns the deed.
[02:14:46.329 --> 02:14:50.912]  Angry, evil, wicked men who love to make us bleed.
[02:14:50.912 --> 02:14:54.274]  These are the men who rule the world and make the policies.
[02:14:54.274 --> 02:14:59.797]  Blinded by the light, feeble-minded Napoleons who can no longer even see.
[02:14:59.797 --> 02:15:06.941]  If rulers didn't rule the world and just left the world to be with disease and unchecked population, destroy humanity?
[02:15:06.941 --> 02:15:10.803]  Or would we just live and thrive in peace and harmony?
[02:15:10.803 --> 02:15:13.705]  Some say a world without rulers would lead to anarchy.
[02:15:14.192 --> 02:15:18.614]  But I believe a world with no rulers is a world where men are free.
[02:15:18.614 --> 02:15:22.176]  Why you wanna take my gun and stick that flu shot in me?
[02:15:22.176 --> 02:15:26.598]  Why must I wait in line to be issued a national ID?
[02:15:26.598 --> 02:15:29.820]  Why must I give my money to an insurance company?
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:33.322]  Why can't I just live and die as an American, brave and free?
[02:15:33.322 --> 02:15:35.463]  That's it, brother.
[02:15:36.616 --> 02:15:37.436]  Well, that's beautiful.
[02:15:37.436 --> 02:15:41.218]  You should at least go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:15:41.218 --> 02:15:46.380]  A lot of poetry and spoken word gets posted in the comment sections.
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:55.404]  And why don't you go post that in the Al Gore video that we have linked up from We Are Change Chicago so people can read that so it has a record there online.
[02:15:55.404 --> 02:15:56.085]  Very beautiful.
[02:15:56.085 --> 02:15:56.605]  Good job.
[02:15:56.605 --> 02:15:57.866]  Good to hear from you.
[02:15:57.866 --> 02:15:59.206]  Let's take another call here.
[02:15:59.206 --> 02:16:02.067]  Let's talk to Thomas in Connecticut.
[02:16:02.067 --> 02:16:04.749]  Speaking of Luciferianism up there by Skull and Bones.
[02:16:05.609 --> 02:16:06.329]  In New Haven.
[02:16:06.329 --> 02:16:07.030]  Go ahead.
[02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:08.651]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[02:16:08.651 --> 02:16:10.011]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:16:10.011 --> 02:16:11.232]  Good.
[02:16:11.232 --> 02:16:12.773]  Listen, I'm a new listener.
[02:16:12.773 --> 02:16:21.037]  I've been listening for a couple of weeks now, and I want to say that I'm... First off, I want to thank you very much for this alternative that you've given to the regular news.
[02:16:21.037 --> 02:16:32.724]  I've been listening, obviously, to the regular news channels, ABC, CBS, NBC, for years, and I've been involved in politics, and I've been looking at the left-right paradigm you talk about so often.
[02:16:32.724 --> 02:16:34.265]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[02:16:34.265 --> 02:16:35.005]  When I look at the left,
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:37.942]  I see just ultra-ultra-liberals.
[02:16:37.942 --> 02:16:39.964]  Not entirely, but I see majority.
[02:16:39.964 --> 02:16:46.549]  I look to the right and I see people that espouse, quote, free markets and so forth, like, you know, like Limbaugh.
[02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:53.375]  But then, and I mean that, but they talk about nothing but protection for the people.
[02:16:53.375 --> 02:16:55.697]  And I'm not for, I'm for the middle road.
[02:16:55.697 --> 02:17:01.481]  I mean, I've studied, I'm an attorney, I've studied, you know, the classics in politics and government and college.
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:17.107]  To me it makes, you know, you're the first person, and I can't say I agree with you on everything yet, because I have not only listened to you for two weeks, but I've been, there's been nothing that, or not nothing, but there's been not a lot of what you're putting out there that makes a whole lot of sense.
[02:17:17.107 --> 02:17:29.553]  And, um, listening to you as a new listener, I've been listening to what my family can attest to voraciously for the past couple of weeks, because, I guess while I don't, uh, give you an example, for instance, 9-11, I can't say that, I mean,
[02:17:30.487 --> 02:17:37.735]  I think I'm scared to look at the literature because I would have a hard time believing that it's a hoax, even if confronted with the truth.
[02:17:37.735 --> 02:17:44.922]  Sir, all we ask you to do is to start questioning everything you're told and start looking into things for yourself.
[02:17:46.317 --> 02:17:59.006]  The Republican and Democratic parties have some good people in both parties, but the leadership give you two different brands, two different roads that lead the same place, consolidation of power, collectivism.
[02:17:59.006 --> 02:18:01.007]  Bush quadruples government.
[02:18:01.007 --> 02:18:03.809]  Obama is even worse than that.
[02:18:03.809 --> 02:18:11.914]  So the Republicans are driving at 10 miles an hour towards the cliff and Obama's driving at 20 miles an hour on some issues.
[02:18:11.914 --> 02:18:15.797]  On some issues, the Republicans are driving faster over the cliff than the Democrats.
[02:18:16.757 --> 02:18:24.680]  And any big government is going to be taken over by private corporate criminal interests and is going to be used to rape you.
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:26.421]  And so we've got to shrink government.
[02:18:26.421 --> 02:18:28.781]  We're bankrupt any way you cut it.
[02:18:28.781 --> 02:18:30.122]  And it's been done by design.
[02:18:30.122 --> 02:18:35.524]  But even if you don't believe it's been done by design, if you don't read their own literature, still it's too big, it's out of control.
[02:18:35.524 --> 02:18:35.844]  It's like
[02:18:37.389 --> 02:18:48.238]  I'm not against illegal aliens, they're just good, hard-working people, but we can't have billions of third-worlders coming here with a socialist system because it will bankrupt everything.
[02:18:48.238 --> 02:18:54.564]  So I'm not against the illegals, but I'm against how they're being used to drive down wages and bring in a new world order.
[02:18:54.564 --> 02:19:01.430]  But see, the left just says, no, all illegals are great, and the right, you know, comes out and kind of whitewashes that.
[02:19:02.861 --> 02:19:05.523]  Well, you have gotten that message out to me, and I want to say that
[02:19:17.842 --> 02:19:20.644]  Well, I've been unable to... I've been satisfied.
[02:19:20.644 --> 02:19:21.565]  I've been listening to you.
[02:19:21.565 --> 02:19:24.687]  I'm going to continue to listen to you, because I'm getting answers.
[02:19:24.687 --> 02:19:26.288]  Do I believe the whole climate gate?
[02:19:26.288 --> 02:19:26.909]  Absolutely.
[02:19:26.909 --> 02:19:28.790]  You're spot on on that.
[02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:35.795]  Well, I mean, to stop my opinion, I mean, they admit the emails are real, and it's the head climatology organization, and they've been caught red-handed.
[02:19:35.795 --> 02:19:39.497]  I mean, it's like Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify.
[02:19:39.497 --> 02:19:47.003]  Sir, if you look at 9-11, it's admitted that the hijackers were given high-level security clearances at trained-at-bases.
[02:19:48.067 --> 02:19:51.749]  Six of the ten commissioners say the whole thing was a whitewash and a cover-up.
[02:19:51.749 --> 02:19:53.230]  Game over!
[02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:54.390]  9-11 is a fraud.
[02:19:54.390 --> 02:19:59.693]  We can debate exactly what happened there, but we know the official story is a giant fraud.
[02:19:59.693 --> 02:20:00.914]  We'll be back with more calls.

[02:21:01.439 --> 02:21:03.620]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:04.460]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:04.800]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:09.843]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.843 --> 02:21:11.463]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.463 --> 02:21:12.204]  Startpage?
[02:21:12.204 --> 02:21:12.624]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.624 --> 02:21:13.724]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.724 --> 02:21:16.686]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.686 --> 02:21:20.568]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:20.568 --> 02:21:23.409]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.689 --> 02:21:26.330]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:27.891]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:28.191]  Right!

[02:21:32.093 --> 02:21:33.433]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:21:33.433 --> 02:21:37.295]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:37.295 --> 02:21:41.076]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:22:01.238 --> 02:22:07.922]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.922 --> 02:22:16.028]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:16.028 --> 02:22:24.213]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:24.213 --> 02:22:28.956]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.276 --> 02:22:34.502]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.502 --> 02:22:38.867]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.867 --> 02:22:39.949]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.949 --> 02:22:44.454]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:23:00.771 --> 02:23:04.872]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:23:04.872 --> 02:23:07.752]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:23:07.752 --> 02:23:09.013]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:09.833]  It's very real.
[02:23:09.833 --> 02:23:12.073]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:23:12.073 --> 02:23:13.734]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:23:53.789 --> 02:24:07.657]  Some folks are born with a silver spoon in their hand.
[02:24:07.657 --> 02:24:12.060]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[02:24:21.201 --> 02:24:23.844]  The red, white, and blue.
[02:24:23.844 --> 02:24:26.327]  The red, white, and blue.
[02:24:26.327 --> 02:24:33.376]  And when the band plays, hell to the teeth, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[02:24:33.376 --> 02:24:33.777]  Tell them!
[02:24:36.443 --> 02:24:47.408]  It ain't me, it ain't me no I ain't no sinner's son It ain't me, it ain't me I ain't no fortunate one
[02:24:57.632 --> 02:25:09.081]  Alright, I'm going to take some more calls and I'm doing a big news blitz when we start the next segment.
[02:25:09.081 --> 02:25:15.305]  I'm going to continue with your calls throughout the broadcast.
[02:25:27.418 --> 02:25:31.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:32.340]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:32.781]  Go ahead.
[02:25:32.781 --> 02:25:34.962]  Two things, Alex.
[02:25:34.962 --> 02:25:41.184]  A message to the Truth Movement and a question on Lindsey Williams.
[02:25:41.184 --> 02:25:45.166]  The spirit of John the Baptist is alive and well, man.
[02:25:45.166 --> 02:25:49.008]  The voice of many crying in the wilderness.
[02:25:49.008 --> 02:25:53.350]  The tip of the spear has borne many children, and one of those children is we are changing.
[02:25:53.350 --> 02:25:54.731]  Look what they are doing, man.
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:58.381]  That was intense, very intense.
[02:25:58.381 --> 02:26:01.563]  Oh, the power, the power of truth, the righteousness.
[02:26:01.563 --> 02:26:06.945]  It's really, I mean, that really buoyed me watching that video.
[02:26:06.945 --> 02:26:12.468]  It's because of us that this swine flu scam has taken a flop over dead.
[02:26:12.468 --> 02:26:14.289]  And they admit that in mainstream media.
[02:26:14.289 --> 02:26:16.910]  They say the public isn't buying it, doctors aren't buying it.
[02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:19.691]  We're having victory, victory, victory, victory.
[02:26:19.691 --> 02:26:21.572]  We can be reprieved like Nineveh.
[02:26:22.435 --> 02:26:23.055]  That's right.
[02:26:23.055 --> 02:26:31.238]  It's hard for some of us to see the forest for the trees, but it seems like everywhere we go, people are privy to what's going on.
[02:26:31.238 --> 02:26:48.345]  There have been many battles in history where one group outnumbered the other group 2, 3, 4, 5, even 10 to 1, but because one group understood the art of war and to never give up and have the spirit, they would beat the larger group because the larger group would feel like they were losing.
[02:26:48.345 --> 02:26:50.226]  So much of this is psychological.
[02:26:51.127 --> 02:26:54.908]  Arrest Al Gore and give We Are Change a Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:26:54.908 --> 02:26:56.549]  Absolutely.
[02:26:56.549 --> 02:26:58.090]  Absolutely.
[02:26:58.090 --> 02:27:01.211]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:27:01.211 --> 02:27:06.833]  The reason he gave for the drop of the price of oil per barrel was that
[02:27:07.523 --> 02:27:12.065]  To bankrupt Dubai, he said that about a year ago on this show, and it happened.
[02:27:12.065 --> 02:27:15.526]  I mean, look, I know the CEO he's talking to.
[02:27:15.526 --> 02:27:23.429]  It's a retired CEO of one of the big five at the time, and everything he gets is directly from the New World Order.
[02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:24.769]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:27:24.769 --> 02:27:25.590]  Thank you so much.
[02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:26.690]  Yeah, it's powerful info.
[02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:29.211]  Look, Lindsey isn't playing games.
[02:27:29.211 --> 02:27:31.212]  I know the names.
[02:27:31.212 --> 02:27:36.394]  He didn't volunteer them because that was his source, but he said, yeah, you're right.
[02:27:38.564 --> 02:27:45.570]  Because, see, he did say the name over ten years ago in an interview when it wasn't a secret.
[02:27:45.570 --> 02:27:46.831]  So, I have a memory.
[02:27:46.831 --> 02:27:49.213]  So I know who it is.
[02:27:49.213 --> 02:27:51.715]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:27:51.715 --> 02:27:53.236]  Mike in California.
[02:27:53.236 --> 02:27:56.179]  Or California, as the usurper calls it.
[02:27:56.179 --> 02:27:58.380]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:27:59.341]  Mike just dropped.
[02:27:59.341 --> 02:28:00.402]  Bonnie in New York.
[02:28:00.402 --> 02:28:01.563]  Bonnie, come ahead.
[02:28:01.563 --> 02:28:02.003]  There.
[02:28:02.003 --> 02:28:03.685]  Hello, hello, hello.
[02:28:03.685 --> 02:28:04.746]  Aloha.
[02:28:04.746 --> 02:28:05.606]  How are you?
[02:28:05.606 --> 02:28:06.287]  Good, Bonnie.
[02:28:06.287 --> 02:28:07.468]  Are you taking care of that cold?
[02:28:08.049 --> 02:28:08.809]  I don't have it anymore.
[02:28:08.809 --> 02:28:10.430]  Drink some Coil Silver.
[02:28:10.430 --> 02:28:11.071]  Right here, baby.
[02:28:11.071 --> 02:28:11.991]  You've been drinking this.
[02:28:11.991 --> 02:28:14.292]  I sent you some healing energy.
[02:28:14.292 --> 02:28:15.773]  Did you feel it?
[02:28:15.773 --> 02:28:17.274]  Feel it.
[02:28:17.274 --> 02:28:18.294]  Good, good.
[02:28:18.294 --> 02:28:28.780]  You know, this is going to be our prescription for fighting the tyranny.
[02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:31.441]  Collective mindset.
[02:28:31.441 --> 02:28:33.922]  Third eye.
[02:28:33.922 --> 02:28:35.963]  Okay, we're fighting a spiritual war.
[02:28:35.963 --> 02:28:36.964]  It's a wavelength war.
[02:28:38.348 --> 02:28:44.091]  Everybody's got to go inside and focus totally on the truth.
[02:28:44.091 --> 02:28:49.214]  But then you've got to manifest that on the street.
[02:28:49.214 --> 02:28:51.316]  How are we going to do that?
[02:28:51.316 --> 02:28:52.396]  Little steps.
[02:28:52.396 --> 02:28:53.937]  Little steps.
[02:28:53.937 --> 02:28:55.598]  That's how big steps start.
[02:28:55.598 --> 02:28:58.280]  You know how we do it, Alex?
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:05.244]  The other day, my husband's a physician and he's been taking care of people for almost 50 years.
[02:29:05.244 --> 02:29:06.704]  And he's a legend in our town.
[02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:07.565]  He's a great healer.
[02:29:09.157 --> 02:29:17.163]  Interestingly enough, grandparents on all sides, and father was a mason, but he declined.
[02:29:17.163 --> 02:29:21.546]  He became a free man, not a free mason.
[02:29:21.546 --> 02:29:26.729]  And he's been in the business of healing people, and just the other day he was on call over the weekend.
[02:29:26.729 --> 02:29:28.991]  He's 81 years old.
[02:29:28.991 --> 02:29:34.915]  And he's given away more free care in our country, in my city, my town, than any other doctor we know.
[02:29:34.915 --> 02:29:36.957]  Anyways, I didn't call to talk about him, but
[02:29:37.745 --> 02:29:38.345]  We'll stay there.
[02:29:38.345 --> 02:29:43.448]  I'm going to come back to you real fast, Bonnie, and then we'll take a few more calls, and I'm going to go over this news.
[02:29:43.448 --> 02:29:48.050]  A lot of news I haven't gotten to, but I wanted to take calls in the first half of the show.
[02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:48.870]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:51.652]  Stay there.
[02:29:51.652 --> 02:29:53.052]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.052 --> 02:29:55.574]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.574 --> 02:29:58.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.076 --> 02:30:07.639]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[02:30:56.059 --> 02:30:56.800]  That's tpr20info.com.
[02:31:01.024 --> 02:31:08.771]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:31:08.771 --> 02:31:14.857]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:31:14.857 --> 02:31:17.819]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:31:17.819 --> 02:31:23.725]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:31:24.085 --> 02:31:25.666]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:31:25.666 --> 02:31:28.147]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:31:28.147 --> 02:31:33.771]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:31:33.771 --> 02:31:35.852]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:31:35.852 --> 02:31:37.613]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:31:37.613 --> 02:31:40.134]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:31:40.134 --> 02:31:44.857]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:31:44.857 --> 02:31:48.579]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:31:48.579 --> 02:31:50.721]  Again, it is hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:31:51.682 --> 02:31:53.590]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:55.819]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:05.904]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.904 --> 02:32:09.167]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.167 --> 02:32:13.951]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:13.951 --> 02:32:20.357]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.357 --> 02:32:22.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:23.420]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:23.941]  Bernanke?
[02:32:23.941 --> 02:32:24.601]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.601 --> 02:32:25.281]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.281 --> 02:32:27.403]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.031 --> 02:32:49.320]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:58.431]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:40.136]  I wish a buck was still silver It was back when the country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:47.142]  When a man could still work, still would.
[02:33:47.142 --> 02:33:56.708]  It's the best of the free life behind us now.
[02:33:56.708 --> 02:34:04.473]  And are the good times really over for good?
[02:34:04.473 --> 02:34:12.438]  And are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell?
[02:34:21.724 --> 02:34:23.906]  That's Merle Haggard!
[02:34:49.793 --> 02:34:53.854]  Think of what globalization has done to this country.
[02:34:53.854 --> 02:35:00.697]  Think about what all the New World Order's activities have produced.
[02:35:00.697 --> 02:35:03.278]  And ask yourself, do we want even more of this?
[02:35:03.278 --> 02:35:05.779]  Ten times what we've already enjoyed?
[02:35:05.779 --> 02:35:09.620]  No, I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
[02:35:10.970 --> 02:35:17.394]  And I'm a free man, I'm not a slave to these offshore banks and all their fraud and all their criminality and I'm standing up against them.
[02:35:17.394 --> 02:35:22.817]  Okay, real fast, Bonnie in New York, finish up the point you were making.
[02:35:22.817 --> 02:35:34.263]  Well, I just, the point I want to make ultimately, Alex, and it wasn't about my wonderful husband who's my hero, but... Sure.
[02:35:34.997 --> 02:35:38.140]  The point of the matter is, there are good guys out there, okay?
[02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:53.852]  I've seen your website, I've been posting, I know all about how the media is using people for their agenda, and they've manipulated events for their agenda, and we see the evil in the world, but there's good out there, okay?
[02:35:53.852 --> 02:35:55.433]  Good people.
[02:35:55.433 --> 02:36:03.100]  And right now what's going on is there's a liberation, okay, from the mental and emotional influences of the past.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:04.681]  There's a spiritual struggle going on.
[02:36:05.242 --> 02:36:06.923]  Alright, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:36:06.923 --> 02:36:07.223]  Listen,
[02:36:34.625 --> 02:36:36.926]  That's a complex issue.
[02:36:36.926 --> 02:36:59.419]  Because, as Gilbert Griffin states correctly, we need to have the long view of history, and we need to get in positions of power ourselves, constitutional positions, and as individual citizens we have that power, as sovereigns, to say no to these usurpations, the usurpers, the conquerors, the illegitimate pirates taking over our society.
[02:36:59.419 --> 02:37:01.660]  But I agree with you about the hierarchy of needs.
[02:37:04.628 --> 02:37:08.031]  You own stuff, stuff doesn't own you.
[02:37:08.031 --> 02:37:13.837]  You don't cheat or steal or hurt people for stuff.
[02:37:13.837 --> 02:37:17.400]  That's why my car gets keyed really bad.
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:20.003]  I'm like, so what?
[02:37:20.003 --> 02:37:21.764]  Or somebody backs into it in a parking lot.
[02:37:21.764 --> 02:37:25.728]  I'm like, eh, I might fix that in a year.
[02:37:25.728 --> 02:37:29.452]  I like having a car that starts, that has a good safety cage.
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:39.967]  That won't break down on the side of the road, but my wife's not materialistic, but she'll say, why don't you clean all the bird crap off your car?
[02:37:39.967 --> 02:37:41.388]  But you haven't cleaned that car in a year.
[02:37:42.495 --> 02:37:46.196]  So I almost go to the far extreme of not caring about things.
[02:37:46.196 --> 02:37:48.296]  Things to me are tools.
[02:37:48.296 --> 02:37:55.118]  But there's also, and I'm not saying you're doing this, but for other people, in the same vein of what you're discussing, kind of an extreme New Age idea.
[02:37:55.118 --> 02:38:02.400]  And India, it's nothing new about it, has that idea, where some of these yogis sit there under a tree, homeless, because they're in bliss.
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:16.290]  They're in nirvana, they're in Valhalla, they're in heaven mentally, spiritually, and so why should they get up or get involved or help anybody because they can mentally transfer themselves somewhere.
[02:38:16.290 --> 02:38:22.454]  So too much of an extreme of that mindset gives you a Calcutta, a living hell.
[02:38:22.454 --> 02:38:27.198]  Take Mexico, incredibly smart, hardworking, neat, inventive people.
[02:38:29.557 --> 02:38:31.318]  But there's an attitude of, so what?
[02:38:31.318 --> 02:38:33.399]  I'll just be lazy because the whole system's corrupt.
[02:38:33.399 --> 02:38:34.659]  Somebody will just take it from me.
[02:38:34.659 --> 02:38:39.522]  I'll do it manana.
[02:38:39.522 --> 02:38:48.946]  I'll take a siesta to where Mexico can't ever seem to get anything done.
[02:38:48.946 --> 02:38:51.507]  And they let the corrupt elite run their system.
[02:38:55.066 --> 02:39:01.149]  But I do understand what you're talking about, about changing our mindsets to go out and have courage and stand up against corruption.
[02:39:01.149 --> 02:39:09.072]  But I think just magically changing your mindset, the proof of the mindset, the proof of the change, is the action you then take.
[02:39:09.072 --> 02:39:13.854]  As Gandhi said, be the change you want to see in the world.
[02:39:13.854 --> 02:39:17.395]  India was easy to take over because people had a lay down and take it attitude.
[02:39:17.395 --> 02:39:19.896]  As soon as they quit having that attitude, it was over.
[02:39:19.896 --> 02:39:23.178]  As soon as they stopped drinking the Kool-Aid.
[02:39:23.178 --> 02:39:23.338]  Now,
[02:39:26.877 --> 02:39:31.480]  I want to shift gears now and cover the news.
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.322]  And then we have a bunch of video and audio clips and other news I'm going to be covering the next hour.
[02:39:35.322 --> 02:39:43.207]  We'll continue with your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:39:43.207 --> 02:39:52.933]  But before I go any further, before this show runs out in an hour and 20 minutes from now, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[02:39:52.933 --> 02:39:54.214]  You know, speaking of materialism,
[02:39:56.348 --> 02:39:59.111]  It's making materialism your god that's bad.
[02:39:59.111 --> 02:40:17.587]  It's having a fancy car and a new big screen TV, but your children are drinking tap water filled with hundreds of deadly chemicals put in the water to hurt their fertility and to brain damage them and give them leukemia and to give them diabetes and to give them bone cancer.
[02:40:17.587 --> 02:40:21.911]  What John P. Holdren calls for, drugging the water supply to sterilize you.
[02:40:21.911 --> 02:40:22.652]  They're doing it.
[02:40:24.124 --> 02:40:27.486]  But people's priority is to go to the football game and get drunk.
[02:40:27.486 --> 02:40:43.514]  Their priority is to go spend $100 a night at the bar buying their buddies drinks instead of supporting this radio show, instead of supporting Ron Paul, instead of supporting themselves or giving their children true organic food.
[02:40:43.514 --> 02:40:44.475]  It's priorities!
[02:40:47.489 --> 02:40:53.191]  The materialism of all the firearms I own isn't, oh, I go pet them and, oh, I have all these guns.
[02:40:53.191 --> 02:40:57.553]  It's that it's the right of a free man to be armed and I own guns.
[02:40:57.553 --> 02:41:13.840]  When I buy gold or silver and make quadruple profits because I knew what was coming, because I could read the Globalist-owned documents, it wasn't so I could go to a safety deposit box and open a little drawer of gold and sit there and go, gold, and play with it with my hands.
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:17.081]  It's so I've got an emergency backup for my family in this operation.
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:21.083]  I'm going off into a rant about this.
[02:41:21.083 --> 02:41:25.567]  The point is, these sponsors are important and people need to support them.
[02:41:25.567 --> 02:41:30.613]  Because raising your consciousness level isn't going to do jack squat about deadly fluoride in your body.
[02:41:30.613 --> 02:41:32.115]  But I do agree with much of what you're saying, ma'am.
[02:41:33.931 --> 02:41:36.192]  Acolablue.com.
[02:41:36.192 --> 02:41:40.873]  Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[02:41:40.873 --> 02:41:43.394]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:41:43.394 --> 02:41:47.596]  Our sponsor, Acolablue, with the Acolablue 28 machine, will allow you to do just that.
[02:41:47.596 --> 02:41:49.596]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons a day of water.
[02:41:52.037 --> 02:42:00.184]  The water once generated passes through a seven-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking.
[02:42:00.184 --> 02:42:02.185]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[02:42:02.185 --> 02:42:04.007]  We spend so much time talking about on this show.
[02:42:04.007 --> 02:42:08.411]  Get your very own source of unlimited, renewable drinking water for you and your families today.
[02:42:09.031 --> 02:42:10.772]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[02:42:34.451 --> 02:42:34.671]  I think?
[02:42:57.566 --> 02:43:01.467]  Make sure you and your family are prepared with non-GMO, good, clean, storable foods.
[02:43:01.467 --> 02:43:12.490]  Give them a call today at 800-409-5633, ask for a free brochure, or visit them on the web at efoodsdirect.com, and they got big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:43:12.490 --> 02:43:13.850]  Again, efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:43:13.850 --> 02:43:13.970]  Okay.
[02:43:13.970 --> 02:43:15.031]  Let's go over the news now.
[02:43:28.482 --> 02:43:36.288]  And when I preface a story like this, I don't preface it because I'm scared of the truth.
[02:43:36.288 --> 02:43:41.553]  I don't preface it because I'm trying to win a popularity contest.
[02:43:41.553 --> 02:43:57.826]  I preface it because it's so subtle and so nuanced and so multifaceted and multivariate that if I come out and report this wrong, it will drive people further apart
[02:43:59.702 --> 02:44:06.706]  And will aid the globalists that want to engage in divide and conquer.
[02:44:06.706 --> 02:44:18.133]  But at the same time, it needs to be discussed because there's a media cover-up concerning this, predominantly.
[02:44:18.133 --> 02:44:23.697]  We report on how the mainline Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist organizations
[02:44:24.742 --> 02:44:29.365]  Are controlled by the federal government, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, and others.
[02:44:29.365 --> 02:44:37.229]  They've been caught over and over again, not just infiltrating the groups, but captaining them, running them.
[02:44:37.229 --> 02:44:45.553]  And I've had all the chief Nazi websites, with millions of viewers a month, always attack Alex Jones.
[02:44:45.553 --> 02:44:48.414]  And why do they do that?
[02:44:48.414 --> 02:44:50.996]  They do that because I have a spirit of victory,
[02:44:51.897 --> 02:44:53.038]  I understand we can win.
[02:44:53.038 --> 02:44:57.801]  I spread that spirit of victory infectiously.
[02:44:57.801 --> 02:45:00.182]  Because I know the power of the people in history.
[02:45:00.182 --> 02:45:03.024]  And I understand that we can't be divided.
[02:45:03.024 --> 02:45:09.207]  We have to be united on the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence against the New World Order.
[02:45:09.207 --> 02:45:17.953]  And when we make it racial or religious, then that allows the globalists to
[02:45:24.574 --> 02:45:26.396]  Divide us and control us.
[02:45:26.396 --> 02:45:34.384]  Under the Constitution, under the Bill of Rights, the minority view, the minority organization, is as protected as the majority.
[02:45:34.384 --> 02:45:43.332]  Because in a pure democracy, 51% can vote to kill, or enslave, or scalp, or whatever they want, the other 49%.
[02:45:46.192 --> 02:46:01.499]  And the big money banks offshore use the howling mob to be sick on the middle class, which is the hereditary enemy of the elite, because the middle class is educated, informed, healthy, dynamic, upwardly mobile.
[02:46:01.499 --> 02:46:03.860]  That's a major wild card.
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:08.702]  But I'm prefacing what I'm going with here because I want to try to give you a bigger picture as I see it.
[02:46:08.702 --> 02:46:09.623]  You can have your own view.
[02:46:12.765 --> 02:46:22.370]  And I knew over the years, and it came out that white supremacist groups in Florida that always attack myself as their number one enemy, they spend more time attacking Alex Jones than they spend attacking Israel.
[02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:25.511]  They claim they hate so much.
[02:46:25.511 --> 02:46:31.374]  And then it came out in the... Oh, what's the big paper in...
[02:46:33.424 --> 02:46:37.889]  Came out in a bunch of the papers, but it came out in the Orlando Sentinel last year.
[02:46:37.889 --> 02:46:43.274]  Headline, leader of white supremacist organization, FBI informant.
[02:46:43.274 --> 02:46:46.117]  And how they ran it, and most of the people in the group were feds.
[02:46:46.117 --> 02:46:52.504]  I've been to protests of the Klan, I've been to protests of the Aryan Nations, and you can look at them, they're cops.
[02:46:53.567 --> 02:47:00.933]  You can look at him, and if anybody was ever the archetypal, you know, genetic look of a Jewish guy.
[02:47:00.933 --> 02:47:05.156]  I mean, here in Austin, they had him here, and it was, you know, the three guys up on stage were Jewish.
[02:47:05.156 --> 02:47:07.197]  I mean, they looked like Howard Stern.
[02:47:07.197 --> 02:47:13.322]  I mean, this was a sickening joke, and I've always pointed that out, and that makes the establishment very, very mad.
[02:47:13.322 --> 02:47:18.226]  Hal Turner, always putting out fake Amaro stories, always putting out fake news.
[02:47:19.565 --> 02:47:21.326]  Always attacking me.
[02:47:21.326 --> 02:47:34.913]  I told you six, seven years ago that guy was a fed and I only come out and say things like that when I'm sure, I listen to him, I knew he was a fed, calling for killing judges and calling for doing all this.
[02:47:34.913 --> 02:47:37.995]  I mean, I knew he was a fed.
[02:47:37.995 --> 02:47:40.956]  Creating list of people.
[02:47:40.956 --> 02:47:43.878]  Now this has come out in the Boston Globe a few months ago, but here it is.
[02:47:43.878 --> 02:47:45.519]  Report, FBI paid blogger
[02:47:48.058 --> 02:47:49.619]  And that is the headline.
[02:47:49.619 --> 02:47:53.861]  Give me a shot for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:47:53.861 --> 02:47:56.623]  This is out of Trenton, New Jersey.
[02:47:56.623 --> 02:48:00.665]  Chicago Tribune.
[02:48:00.665 --> 02:48:06.629]  Also broadcast on WGN Radio and WGN9 TV.
[02:48:06.629 --> 02:48:10.191]  Report, FBI paid blogger and it turns out he is an agent like he said he was.
[02:48:16.141 --> 02:48:26.950]  There are groups of poor, disgruntled white people who go out and who beat up black men or beat up Hispanics.
[02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:30.132]  And those cases do happen, but very rarely.
[02:48:30.132 --> 02:48:38.339]  That said, there is another group openly run by the feds that I must expose because I'm about the truth.
[02:48:38.339 --> 02:48:42.122]  I'm about integrity.
[02:48:42.122 --> 02:48:43.443]  I'm gonna get to black folks in a minute.
[02:48:45.103 --> 02:48:46.765]  But Mecce and La Raza.
[02:48:46.765 --> 02:48:48.246]  La Raza means the race.
[02:48:48.246 --> 02:48:50.228]  And their motto is, for those in the race, everything.
[02:48:50.228 --> 02:48:51.769]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[02:48:51.769 --> 02:48:53.931]  That's literally a Hitler translation.
[02:48:53.931 --> 02:48:55.513]  For the German people, everything.
[02:48:55.513 --> 02:48:57.735]  For those outside the German Aryan race, nothing.
[02:48:59.221 --> 02:49:01.343]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:49:01.343 --> 02:49:03.625]  But they're not just funded by the FBI.
[02:49:03.625 --> 02:49:05.526]  They're funded by Miller Brewing.
[02:49:05.526 --> 02:49:07.047]  They're funded by Anheuser-Busch.
[02:49:07.047 --> 02:49:09.910]  They're funded by AT&T.
[02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:12.612]  They're funded by... I mean, go to their website.
[02:49:12.612 --> 02:49:14.714]  Hundreds of corporate sponsors.
[02:49:14.714 --> 02:49:20.618]  They've got comedians they put on national television constantly invoking race.
[02:49:20.618 --> 02:49:22.040]  What is behind this?
[02:49:23.706 --> 02:49:24.987]  Divide and conquer.
[02:49:24.987 --> 02:49:27.929]  So I'm going to briefly explain that when we come back.
[02:49:27.929 --> 02:49:33.454]  Then I'm going to get into police shootings.
[02:49:33.454 --> 02:49:45.343]  There are black men all over the United States killing cops and attacking whites and Hispanics.
[02:49:45.343 --> 02:49:49.207]  And this latest situation, the suspect they have cornered,
[02:49:50.723 --> 02:50:01.228]  They believe went and shot these four cops, he's a suspect, but another person just pled guilty.
[02:50:01.228 --> 02:50:13.113]  There's another report out of Oakland where the man's pled guilty to killing the four police officers.
[02:50:13.113 --> 02:50:17.095]  And the media is not explaining, they go out and target white officers and kill them.
[02:50:18.601 --> 02:50:25.682]  And this is all racially driven, and I want to break down where all of this is going if we don't stop it.
[02:50:25.682 --> 02:50:39.385]  This is exactly what the new world order wants, but clearly there are racial attacks by blacks on whites, mainly police officers, going on nationwide.
[02:50:39.385 --> 02:50:43.906]  And I don't believe this is staged, but we're going to talk about that too.
[02:50:46.018 --> 02:50:48.840]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to
[02:51:06.152 --> 02:51:08.973]  Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:51:08.973 --> 02:51:12.694]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:51:12.694 --> 02:51:21.717]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[02:51:21.717 --> 02:51:27.858]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[02:51:27.858 --> 02:51:32.720]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:33.760]  With your system purchase,
[02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:34.640]  We're good to go.
[02:52:02.882 --> 02:52:06.907]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.907 --> 02:52:10.150]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:11.552]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:12.479 --> 02:52:14.942]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.942 --> 02:52:21.347]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.347 --> 02:52:26.892]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.892 --> 02:52:36.521]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.621 --> 02:52:38.983]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.983 --> 02:52:40.564]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.564 --> 02:52:43.026]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.026 --> 02:52:45.167]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.167 --> 02:52:50.311]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.311 --> 02:52:55.315]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:55.315 --> 02:52:59.418]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.365 --> 02:53:05.911]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:53:05.911 --> 02:53:10.257]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:53:10.257 --> 02:53:16.004]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:53:16.004 --> 02:53:16.425]  It's true.
[02:53:16.745 --> 02:53:22.448]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:53:22.448 --> 02:53:26.030]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:30.732]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:53:30.732 --> 02:53:33.493]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:53:33.493 --> 02:53:37.975]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:53:37.975 --> 02:53:41.857]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:53:42.117 --> 02:53:47.159]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:53:47.159 --> 02:53:51.341]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:51.341 --> 02:53:53.122]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:53.122 --> 02:53:55.382]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:53:55.382 --> 02:53:57.283]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:53:57.283 --> 02:53:58.164]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[02:54:13.916 --> 02:54:41.188]  About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph He blew his mind out in a car
[02:54:49.446 --> 02:55:10.570]  Okay, so people are asking, what do white supremacists predominantly run by the government and other private organizations connected to government have to do with Mecha and La Raza, which are thousands of times bigger than the white supremacist organizations that the media says are legitimate, are allowed to be racially based, are allowed to be racist?
[02:55:10.570 --> 02:55:12.530]  What does that have to do with cop killers?
[02:55:14.497 --> 02:55:24.542]  Well, the bottom line is they've got all these racial groups feeling sorry for themselves, feeling victimized, feeling like they have a right to do whatever they want.
[02:55:24.542 --> 02:55:40.831]  And I read every few days in local papers from Texas to California, from Indiana to New York, where Hispanic, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, others, go and target blacks mainly, and just kill black men on the street.
[02:55:40.831 --> 02:55:42.532]  I mean, every couple days I read about that.
[02:55:43.837 --> 02:55:46.979]  But it's never called racial, it's called gang.
[02:55:46.979 --> 02:55:50.261]  No, they're targeting black men.
[02:55:50.261 --> 02:55:52.282]  And there's some targeting of whites.
[02:55:52.282 --> 02:55:57.345]  And the media only hypes it up, though, when whites kill a black person or a Hispanic.
[02:55:57.345 --> 02:56:00.306]  When you look at the statistics, it's off the charts the other way around.
[02:56:00.306 --> 02:56:05.309]  Because these groups feel sorry for themselves and have been taught, Whitey is the reason this has happened.
[02:56:08.234 --> 02:56:12.495]  When the globalists may be predominantly white, but they're poisoning everybody's water supply.
[02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:25.080]  The Federal Reserve is taxing everybody out of existence and shutting down our factories and trying to force vaccines on all of us, and we better stick together, even if some of you want to kill each other later.
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:34.463]  If you want to be ignorant, that's your business, but we might as well get together against the Federal Reserve now, and then you can kill each other later if you're hell-bent on that.
[02:56:35.287 --> 02:56:38.508]  Because the big threat is the scientific dictatorship.
[02:56:38.508 --> 02:56:43.930]  It is the world government, the people that created HIV-AIDS.
[02:56:43.930 --> 02:56:48.331]  You don't hear Jesse Jackson when he's out race pimping talking about that, do you?
[02:56:48.331 --> 02:56:55.833]  You don't hear him talking about Obama doubling the forced abortion money for China and Africa.
[02:56:55.833 --> 02:57:00.335]  Now, without even looking this morning, I googled police shooting.
[02:57:00.335 --> 02:57:04.736]  And I found three articles about black men shooting or allegedly shooting police.
[02:57:06.104 --> 02:57:11.587]  Family accused, family account of Oakland parolee who killed the four police officers.
[02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:13.008]  He's pled guilty.
[02:57:13.008 --> 02:57:29.096]  The Oakland parolee who took the lives of four Oakland police officers knew he was a wanted man and deliberately skipped out on a meeting as part of a feud he was having with his parole agent, his family said today.
[02:57:29.096 --> 02:57:31.578]  Lavelle Mixon.
[02:57:31.578 --> 02:57:32.298]  Now that's Oakland.
[02:57:35.290 --> 02:57:38.775]  I've got another one right here.
[02:57:38.775 --> 02:57:42.920]  Denver police arrest 32 in series of downtown assaults.
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:48.527]  They admit in this article, this is the rarity, that it was racially motivated.
[02:57:49.397 --> 02:58:01.102]  The Denver Police arrested 32 men and juvenile boys after a months-long undercover investigation into what police said were racially motivated assaults and robberies in downtown Denver, including the Lodue Entertainment District.
[02:58:01.102 --> 02:58:14.887]  A task force composed of Denver Police, FBI, and Denver District Attorney's Office investigated 26 incidents, and that's tip of the iceberg, in which groups of black males verbally harassed, assaulted, and at times robbed white or Latino males, according to Denver Police Chief.
[02:58:14.887 --> 02:58:18.429]  See, that's because it's racially, they think it's okay
[02:58:19.289 --> 02:58:20.570]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:20.570 --> 02:58:22.431]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.155 --> 02:59:00.301]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:59:00.301 --> 02:59:03.683]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:59:03.683 --> 02:59:09.546]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[02:59:09.546 --> 02:59:14.029]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:26.136]  Oxysilver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[02:59:26.136 --> 02:59:31.680]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:33.501]  Help others and earn extra income!
[02:59:33.541 --> 02:59:33.961]  We're good to go.
[03:00:18.594 --> 03:00:24.697]  So all over the nation, Hispanics are killing blacks predominantly.
[03:00:24.697 --> 03:00:28.618]  Blacks are killing whites and Hispanics.
[03:00:28.618 --> 03:00:30.299]  Everybody's killing Asians.
[03:00:30.299 --> 03:00:31.979]  Asians are killing Asians.
[03:00:31.979 --> 03:00:33.660]  They mainly prey on each other.
[03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:37.141]  Statistically, we have all these FBI, Justice Department numbers.
[03:00:37.141 --> 03:00:39.102]  It paints a really dangerous picture.
[03:00:40.089 --> 03:00:57.743]  Meanwhile, the globalists are up there laughing because as this racial crime intensifies, the establishment can run all these ads and government programs speaking out against it, which only adds to the tension.
[03:00:57.743 --> 03:01:03.187]  This is the Defy and Conquer program.
[03:01:03.187 --> 03:01:08.972]  Now, I don't know if this is the case, but he certainly fits the bill with the assessment
[03:01:10.492 --> 03:01:20.240]  But it turns out that an individual who was pardoned by Huckabee in 2000, and who has been charged with rape and assault on a police officer recently,
[03:01:23.027 --> 03:01:28.211]  Is the person they believe, he's the main suspect, gunned down four police officers yesterday.
[03:01:28.211 --> 03:01:38.780]  A gunman alleged to have shot dead four police officers was on the run Monday after a house at the center of a tent standoff in Washington State was found to be empty, police said.
[03:01:38.780 --> 03:01:48.748]  After laying siege to the home in Seattle's Lecce neighborhood for 11 hours, police SWAT teams entered the building where convicted felon Maurice Clemons was believed to be holed up.
[03:01:51.598 --> 03:01:52.619]  We have cleared the residence.
[03:01:52.619 --> 03:01:56.421]  Seattle Police Tactical went in and checked the residence.
[03:01:56.421 --> 03:02:04.025]  The suspect was not there.
[03:02:04.025 --> 03:02:04.765]  And it goes on.
[03:02:04.765 --> 03:02:11.909]  A murder warrant has been issued while a reward leading to Clemons' arrest has been increased to $125,000.
[03:02:11.909 --> 03:02:14.570]  The police don't want to tell you they've got license plate reading cameras.
[03:02:14.570 --> 03:02:16.931]  That's probably how they tracked him so fast.
[03:02:16.931 --> 03:02:17.812]  If he did indeed do it.
[03:02:19.116 --> 03:02:21.882]  You need to let me know you're listening to me.
[03:02:21.882 --> 03:02:23.746]  I understand that you may need some medical help.
[03:02:23.746 --> 03:02:27.955]  One negotiator said through local media.
[03:02:27.955 --> 03:02:28.797]  And it goes on...
[03:02:30.646 --> 03:02:37.430]  It says he was released on bail last week after being held for several months on charges of assaulting a police officer and child rape.
[03:02:37.430 --> 03:02:39.651]  Now, why are potheads kept?
[03:02:39.651 --> 03:02:42.032]  Because they make good workers in the private prisons.
[03:02:42.032 --> 03:02:50.036]  But the government has been caught in government documents before admitting they release violent offenders to go out and create carnage in the public.
[03:02:50.036 --> 03:02:52.958]  Low-level cops don't know this, but the high-level ones do.
[03:02:52.958 --> 03:02:54.819]  So that the public begs for more police.
[03:02:56.585 --> 03:02:57.625]  And what do you expect?
[03:02:57.625 --> 03:03:05.567]  I mean, Huckabee let this guy go after all the horrible rap sheets and things he did earlier?
[03:03:05.567 --> 03:03:11.489]  After his release, Clemens committed two armed robberies and a string of other crimes, which earned him another 10-year sentence.
[03:03:11.489 --> 03:03:21.191]  According to the Seattle Times, Clemens served only part of a 35-year sentence in Arkansas before it was commuted in 2000 when Governor Huckabee sought the Republican presidential nomination.
[03:03:25.512 --> 03:03:28.214]  And I've got here in the article what his previous convictions were.
[03:03:28.214 --> 03:03:28.894]  I don't remember.
[03:03:28.894 --> 03:03:32.176]  I know it was really, really bad.
[03:03:32.176 --> 03:03:35.978]  Will you guys pull that up for me?
[03:03:35.978 --> 03:03:37.339]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[03:03:37.339 --> 03:03:38.800]  It was really bad.
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:40.601]  I want to say it was murder.
[03:03:40.601 --> 03:03:42.722]  And Huckabee said because he did it when he was 17, he let him go.
[03:03:44.446 --> 03:03:50.588]  The point is, this guy, it's released over and over and over and over again for violent offenses.
[03:03:50.588 --> 03:03:53.349]  The jails, we have more prisons than any other country in the world.
[03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:55.509]  Even China has a billion, three hundred million.
[03:03:55.509 --> 03:03:57.430]  They have less prisons than us.
[03:03:57.430 --> 03:04:06.032]  I mean, there are people for white collar offenses, petty offenses, cops beat people up, and on squad car video, and then charge them with assault.
[03:04:06.032 --> 03:04:08.873]  The person serves five years.
[03:04:08.873 --> 03:04:11.414]  And all the fake charges you've put out, police,
[03:04:12.847 --> 03:04:22.215]  Packs the prisons full of non-violent people, so real killers are on the loose, like this other guy that killed four cops.
[03:04:22.215 --> 03:04:26.238]  Had all these violent convictions, and you let him go.
[03:04:26.238 --> 03:04:27.359]  The courts let him go.
[03:04:27.359 --> 03:04:36.006]  And then the answer by the media is, oh see, we need more prisons.
[03:04:36.006 --> 03:04:37.668]  See how they do that?
[03:04:37.668 --> 03:04:38.989]  It's all psychology.
[03:04:40.748 --> 03:04:50.891]  See, it's okay when this guy's preying on raping kids and robbing people and shooting people, but now he's killed four cops, allegedly.
[03:04:50.891 --> 03:04:57.013]  So if he gets caught and convicted, they're gonna kill him with lethal injection.
[03:04:57.013 --> 03:04:59.114]  You know, 90% of cop killers get caught.
[03:05:01.025 --> 03:05:02.147]  Can only 10% of people that kill us do?
[03:05:15.745 --> 03:05:17.286]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.286 --> 03:05:18.466]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.466 --> 03:05:19.587]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.587 --> 03:05:21.488]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.488 --> 03:05:22.548]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.548 --> 03:05:24.749]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.749 --> 03:05:26.090]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:26.090 --> 03:05:27.630]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.630 --> 03:05:32.893]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.893 --> 03:05:36.474]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.474 --> 03:05:39.936]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.296 --> 03:05:41.517]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.517 --> 03:05:42.418]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.418 --> 03:05:43.520]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:44.461]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.461 --> 03:05:45.542]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.542 --> 03:05:48.605]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:06:07.862 --> 03:06:09.963]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[03:08:02.175 --> 03:08:07.758]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:25.965 --> 03:08:28.765]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:28.765 --> 03:08:34.026]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:08:34.026 --> 03:08:44.948]  I am going to continue with some of the news here, and then I'm going to get into your phone calls.
[03:08:44.948 --> 03:08:50.409]  But first, I wanted to play the first few minutes of my interview with Lord Mocton Friday.
[03:08:50.409 --> 03:08:55.030]  This hour-long interview is just dynamite with so much information.
[03:08:57.512 --> 03:09:03.141]  And it's posted at YouTube, it's posted in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[03:09:03.141 --> 03:09:10.011]  I'm asking everyone to go get the articles that Paul Watson has written, one of them titled, Lord Monckton.
[03:09:11.149 --> 03:09:12.450]  Abolish the UN.
[03:09:12.450 --> 03:09:13.491]  Arrest Al Gore.
[03:09:13.491 --> 03:09:15.793]  And it breaks down all the key points.
[03:09:15.793 --> 03:09:17.434]  It's great to email friends and family.
[03:09:17.434 --> 03:09:23.058]  And it has the hour-long video slash radio interview I did Friday with Lord Monk.
[03:09:23.058 --> 03:09:24.699]  I know a lot of you were on vacation then.
[03:09:24.699 --> 03:09:26.280]  A lot of you didn't tune in that day.
[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:31.904]  It was one of the best interviews I've ever done on the fake man-made climate change, on all of this.
[03:09:33.152 --> 03:09:41.697]  And how important this fight in Copenhagen, Denmark coming up in seven and a half days is that Obama is going to be attending where they're openly setting up world government.
[03:09:41.697 --> 03:09:43.519]  Are we ready with Lord Monckton?
[03:09:43.519 --> 03:09:44.699]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[03:09:44.699 --> 03:09:46.000]  Here it is.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:52.944]  Campaign last week when it came out those emails were real and I would imagine you were popping some champagne.
[03:09:52.944 --> 03:09:57.147]  Well we've been following the people named in these emails for years.
[03:09:57.147 --> 03:10:01.870]  We thought they were linked and of course these emails establish exactly how they were linked.
[03:10:02.672 --> 03:10:21.140]  And it's very, very interesting because we had suspected there were just about two dozen people who, around the world, mostly this side of the Atlantic and in America, who were putting this global warming scam together and actually driving it, rather than doing what the likes of Al Gore and the politicians do, just drifting along with it because they don't know any better.
[03:10:21.140 --> 03:10:24.342]  These are the people who have known all along that there isn't a problem.
[03:10:24.862 --> 03:10:34.287]  And they've been bending the data and admitting to each other they've been bending the data for the sake of concealing the fact that their data are no good.
[03:10:34.287 --> 03:10:35.187]  Absolutely.
[03:10:35.187 --> 03:10:38.068]  And I mean, this really proves a conspiracy here, doesn't it?
[03:10:38.068 --> 03:10:42.531]  You have called for the prosecution of the climate criminals.
[03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:43.771]  You were the first.
[03:10:43.771 --> 03:10:49.154]  Now many other representatives from Australia to the United States are calling for criminal investigations.
[03:10:49.855 --> 03:11:08.997]  There's going to have to be a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner, whose job is to make sure that publicly available information is available to the public, and that officials like the creeps in the Climate Research Centre, and their colleagues all over the United States as well, were prevented from
[03:11:09.597 --> 03:11:17.802]  Hiding, destroying, tampering with, shuffling away the data which we paid for and it therefore belongs to us.
[03:11:17.802 --> 03:11:20.203]  And they used a series of excuses.
[03:11:20.203 --> 03:11:22.204]  They said, well, there's a Data Protection Act.
[03:11:22.204 --> 03:11:25.946]  They said the data belonged to other countries' weather bureaus.
[03:11:25.946 --> 03:11:27.687]  Hey, this is weather data.
[03:11:27.687 --> 03:11:29.388]  It's not a state secret.
[03:11:29.388 --> 03:11:30.289]  They were trying to say,
[03:11:31.995 --> 03:11:37.517]  They were emailing each other, they were saying, we are not going to give this data to anybody.
[03:11:37.517 --> 03:11:54.983]  They were even saying they wouldn't write any learned papers for journals which required, as part of the peer review process, that all the data and all the computer code and all the intermediate calculations should be shown and archived so that other scientists could check it.
[03:11:54.983 --> 03:11:55.963]  They were determined.
[03:11:56.363 --> 03:12:03.325]  That other scientists shouldn't be allowed to check their work because they knew that they were simply making things up.
[03:12:03.325 --> 03:12:06.486]  These people are financial fraudsters.
[03:12:06.486 --> 03:12:11.128]  They took at least $20 million that we can trace in recent years.
[03:12:11.708 --> 03:12:19.773]  In so-called grants for so-called scientific research, and they did it on the basis of a financial and scientific fraud.
[03:12:19.773 --> 03:12:31.520]  So they should not only be locked up for concealing and destroying data that have been requested under the Freedom of Information Act by other scientists, they should also be locked up for financial fraud and international racketeering.
[03:12:32.717 --> 03:12:34.278]  Well said, sir.
[03:12:34.278 --> 03:12:37.200]  We're going to come right back after this quick break with a long segment.
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:13:00.317]  I would like to, blow by blow, get your detailed knowledge of this, some of the history, who these people are, what their bigger goals are, and then specifically, right through Climategate, all the different sectors of fraud that they have engaged in, like covering up the FOIA request, persecuting scientists, colluding to persecute people, which is racketeering, which is extortion,
[03:13:00.898 --> 03:13:04.812]  Uh, fraud, grant fraud, and now their response saying so what?
[03:13:07.665 --> 03:13:22.096]  Well, for the rest of the hour, Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount of Monckton and Brinsley, worked at the highest levels of the UK government at 10 Downing Street with one of the chief advisors to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
[03:13:22.096 --> 03:13:25.719]  You can find out more about his bio by visiting his website.
[03:13:25.719 --> 03:13:28.941]  We'll give that out again repeatedly before he leaves us.
[03:13:28.941 --> 03:13:31.363]  But some stations just joined us recapping.
[03:13:31.363 --> 03:13:33.545]  Lord Monckton, tell us about yourself.
[03:13:34.085 --> 03:13:46.129]  You've been talking about this for more than a decade, and now what ClimateGate means, the different sectors of fraud, and how you believe, from your perspective, this should be prosecuted.
[03:13:46.129 --> 03:13:58.933]  For those who haven't come across ClimateGate, this was the release of a large number of emails between about two dozen malevolent, crooked scientists.
[03:13:59.722 --> 03:14:11.854]  Right at the top of the climatological tree, these are the people who, between them, have conspired to invent and then maintain the scare of global warming.
[03:14:11.854 --> 03:14:18.161]  And the emails came from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Centre,
[03:14:18.832 --> 03:14:33.805]  Which specializes in calculating the global temperature record for the whole world over the last 150 years since we first began having what one might call global instrumental coverage with thermometers all over the world.
[03:14:34.557 --> 03:14:41.221]  And it's quite a complex process because very few of the temperature stations remain in the same place for any length of time.
[03:14:41.221 --> 03:14:45.984]  They come in and out, some work, some stop working, some don't report properly, some don't report at all.
[03:14:45.984 --> 03:14:51.347]  Whole chunks of Russia disappeared in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down.
[03:14:51.347 --> 03:14:54.829]  So it's very difficult actually to make sense of all this data.
[03:14:55.635 --> 03:15:09.100]  But unfortunately, what they were doing at the Climate Research Centre, with active assistance from many other climate scientists around the world, was they were simply making up the 20th century record of temperatures.
[03:15:09.608 --> 03:15:13.989]  So we don't even know how much warmer it has got over the 20th century.
[03:15:13.989 --> 03:15:17.490]  We know, broadly speaking, it's got warmer because it's been getting warmer for 300 years.
[03:15:17.490 --> 03:15:18.571]  Nothing to do with us.
[03:15:18.571 --> 03:15:20.171]  But we didn't know how much.
[03:15:20.171 --> 03:15:38.457]  And the whole idea of having this very elaborate international network of temperature stations with people going and looking in little boxes and making a note of the temperature every day and then phoning their local weather bureau and that then being passed on to just two or three places around the world, of which East Anglia was one where they compiled these records,
[03:15:38.817 --> 03:16:05.768]  This was an enormously elaborate piece of work, and then when it got to East Anglia, and the other, and the two American universities where this was processed, what they did then, as we now know because we've seen their computer code and we've seen their data, they didn't store the data properly, they didn't keep it in an organized form, they didn't know by the end of it what their own computer programs were doing, but they were processing all of the data several times over, and it had become a complete mess.
[03:16:05.768 --> 03:16:08.369]  And essentially, they were simply making up
[03:16:08.914 --> 03:16:12.277]  The temperature increases of the last 20 years.
[03:16:12.277 --> 03:16:14.179]  It is simply a fiction.
[03:16:14.179 --> 03:16:14.920]  It's science fiction.
[03:16:15.899 --> 03:16:21.783]  Well, expanding on that, and of course you obviously have read the emails, they talk about temperatures are dropping.
[03:16:21.783 --> 03:16:22.724]  How do we fix it?
[03:16:22.724 --> 03:16:24.185]  How do we spin it?
[03:16:24.185 --> 03:16:27.267]  How do we hide the decline?
[03:16:27.267 --> 03:16:38.436]  And then of course there's the whole area of how they're talking about keeping people out of journals, persecuting journals, blocking FOIA requests, working with government officials to block this information from the public.
[03:16:38.436 --> 03:16:39.837]  I mean, this is racketeering.
[03:16:40.623 --> 03:16:41.543]  It is racketeering.
[03:16:41.543 --> 03:16:42.924]  I think it does.
[03:16:42.924 --> 03:16:46.525]  It is nicely covered by your RICO statute.
[03:16:46.525 --> 03:16:51.847]  And funny enough, we have just put a new act on the statute book a few years ago called the Fraud Act.
[03:16:51.847 --> 03:16:57.128]  And this is fraud on our side of the Atlantic and racketeering, as you would call it, on yours.
[03:16:57.128 --> 03:17:00.990]  These are people who deserve to go to prison for a very long time.
[03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:08.432]  And I'll tell you why I'm so angry about it, because this is a point that's nearly always forgotten in all the commentaries about climate change.
[03:17:09.426 --> 03:17:13.551]  Global warming isn't killing anyone and it isn't going to kill anyone.
[03:17:13.551 --> 03:17:22.842]  What is killing people and killing them by the million of starvation now is the effect of the global warming scare.
[03:17:22.842 --> 03:17:25.125]  Because many nations, including the United States,
[03:17:25.777 --> 03:17:36.660]  have taken up to a third of their agricultural land out from growing food for people who needed it to growing biofuels for clunkers that didn't.
[03:17:36.660 --> 03:17:42.622]  And that has meant in the last year or two a doubling, and I mean a doubling, of world food prices.
[03:17:42.622 --> 03:17:53.645]  And the World Bank says that nearly all of that doubling of world food prices is directly attributable to the biofuel scam, which in turn is directly caused by the global warming scare
[03:17:54.065 --> 03:17:57.807]  And governments saying, well, even if it isn't true, we've got to take precautions.
[03:17:57.807 --> 03:18:07.991]  But you have to remember, you also have to take precautions to check that the precautions you're taking are not killing people by the million, which is what this policy of biofuels is actually doing.
[03:18:09.168 --> 03:18:14.971]  All of this scare comes out from these idiots and these crooks and these criminals.
[03:18:14.971 --> 03:18:18.972]  I'm very sorry I'm not kind of keeping my normal calm self here.
[03:18:18.972 --> 03:18:32.718]  I'm so incandescent with fury that these people whom we as British taxpayers and you as American taxpayers have been paying to do this work and we have been trusting them to do it right.
[03:18:32.718 --> 03:18:35.019]  They have simply not only been making it up
[03:18:35.825 --> 03:18:45.713]  But as you rightly say, they have been tampering with the peer review process, trying to interfere with reviewers to persuade them to pass or not to pass papers they didn't like.
[03:18:45.713 --> 03:18:56.402]  They've been trying to bully journal editors whom they don't like into resigning and getting the boards of the papers to appoint, the learned journals, to appoint somebody else more agreeable to them.
[03:18:56.402 --> 03:19:00.485]  They've been interfering with the process of the UN's climate panel itself.
[03:19:00.925 --> 03:19:05.768]  By saying in one case, here are two papers we don't like because they show that we're wrong.
[03:19:05.768 --> 03:19:20.757]  We will make sure that these papers do not ever get anywhere near the UN Climate Report for 2007, even if we have to redefine the peer review process in order to do it.
[03:19:20.757 --> 03:19:24.039]  Okay, there is Lord Christopher Monckton.
[03:19:24.039 --> 03:19:27.641]  There are four more parts of that hour-long interview.
[03:19:27.641 --> 03:19:30.023]  They're all posted right now.
[03:19:31.232 --> 03:19:34.333]  at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:19:34.333 --> 03:19:36.214]  They're posted in the great article.
[03:19:36.214 --> 03:19:42.097]  Headline, Lord Monckton, abolish the United Nations, arrest Al Gore.
[03:19:42.097 --> 03:19:48.300]  This is powerful information, obviously, and needs to be seen by everyone.
[03:19:48.300 --> 03:19:53.762]  No one can stop you, listeners, if you decide to take action and spread those videos to the four winds.
[03:19:53.762 --> 03:19:59.865]  We'll be right back with more news, your calls, and clips of the Charlie Sheen interview live from yesterday.
[03:20:02.674 --> 03:20:04.395]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[03:20:04.395 --> 03:20:08.196]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[03:20:08.196 --> 03:20:13.037]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[03:20:13.037 --> 03:20:18.739]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[03:20:18.739 --> 03:20:21.200]  Patriotfood.com.
[03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:26.301]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[03:20:26.301 --> 03:20:31.023]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[03:20:32.046 --> 03:20:37.930]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[03:20:37.930 --> 03:20:42.454]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[03:20:42.454 --> 03:20:48.859]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[03:20:48.859 --> 03:20:53.182]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[03:20:53.182 --> 03:20:57.505]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[03:20:57.505 --> 03:21:00.027]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[03:21:01.832 --> 03:21:04.134]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:21:04.134 --> 03:21:06.015]  November 30th, 2009.
[03:21:06.015 --> 03:21:07.396]  Gold opened this morning at $1173.90.
[03:21:07.396 --> 03:21:13.161]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1208.60, $604.30 for a half ounce, or $302.15 for the quarter ounce.
[03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:14.062]  That's $1208.60, $604.30, or $302.15.
[03:21:21.347 --> 03:21:34.957]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:21:34.957 --> 03:21:43.543]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:21:43.783 --> 03:21:44.884]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:21:44.884 --> 03:21:49.248]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:21:49.248 --> 03:21:50.209]  Call for your copy.
[03:21:50.209 --> 03:21:51.209]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.209 --> 03:21:55.153]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:21:55.153 --> 03:21:57.955]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:57.955 --> 03:22:02.739]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.739 --> 03:22:06.743]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.743 --> 03:22:09.986]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:09.986 --> 03:22:11.407]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.108 --> 03:22:14.769]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.769 --> 03:22:21.171]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.171 --> 03:22:26.713]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.713 --> 03:22:36.337]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.457 --> 03:22:38.799]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.799 --> 03:22:40.400]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:42.841]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.841 --> 03:22:44.982]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.982 --> 03:22:50.126]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.126 --> 03:22:55.149]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:55.149 --> 03:22:59.251]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:03.325 --> 03:23:04.546]  This is not a drill.
[03:23:04.546 --> 03:23:07.048]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:23:07.048 --> 03:23:08.970]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:23:08.970 --> 03:23:16.175]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:23:16.175 --> 03:23:20.579]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[03:23:20.579 --> 03:23:30.907]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:23:31.087 --> 03:23:32.708]  Under any circumstance.
[03:23:32.708 --> 03:23:39.932]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[03:23:39.932 --> 03:23:40.693]  But listen up.
[03:23:40.693 --> 03:23:46.876]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[03:23:46.876 --> 03:23:48.717]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[03:23:48.717 --> 03:23:50.899]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[03:23:50.899 --> 03:23:51.379]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[03:23:51.379 --> 03:23:53.260]  Before they come for your guns.
[03:23:53.260 --> 03:23:54.461]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:08.411]  Just a program note.
[03:24:08.411 --> 03:24:09.291]  I was wrong earlier.
[03:24:09.291 --> 03:24:10.512]  I was going off a blog.
[03:24:10.512 --> 03:24:16.495]  He got that 95-year sentence according to CNN.
[03:24:16.495 --> 03:24:26.121]  The suspect in the latest shootings, the killing of four cops in a suburb of Seattle, this Maurice Clemens.
[03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:34.636]  Got 99 years in 89 for a host of charges including robberies, burglaries, thefts, bringing a gun to school.
[03:24:34.636 --> 03:24:37.997]  He now has a murder warrant out on him.
[03:24:37.997 --> 03:24:46.058]  And then he had arrest warrants out where he'd been arrested and had been released for child rape, assault of a police officer.
[03:24:46.058 --> 03:24:52.739]  He'd been released from another prison sentence a few years ago for robbery.
[03:24:52.739 --> 03:24:56.620]  I mean, this guy has a rap sheet a million feet long and why was he released from prison?
[03:24:59.472 --> 03:25:03.996]  Oh boy.
[03:25:03.996 --> 03:25:06.719]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:25:06.719 --> 03:25:21.792]  But the establishment statistically releases violent offenders quicker than they release non-violent because they're used by the social engineers to kind of herd the general population into being so terrified they call for more police and more prisons.
[03:25:21.792 --> 03:25:25.436]  We have more prisons than anybody else in the world and we have more crime than many nations.
[03:25:26.570 --> 03:25:35.457]  It's because we are a sick, sick society, and the highest crime rates are in New York City and Chicago, where you have total gun bans, because that's where all the criminals move.
[03:25:35.457 --> 03:25:40.361]  Only law-abiding citizens then follow the unconstitutional law.
[03:25:40.361 --> 03:25:48.668]  Okay, let me get into ClimateGate now, then I'm gonna come back and take phone calls from Robert, Robert, Reid, David, Matt, and others that are patiently holding.
[03:25:50.503 --> 03:25:57.848]  We're gonna have more guests coming up this week on ClimateGate, but they announced, oh, we accidentally destroyed all the original emails and documents.
[03:25:57.848 --> 03:26:09.536]  Those are our emails that were stolen a few weeks ago, but they've since stolen by somebody inside, probably, who didn't want to be involved in the criminal activity, because that's in the emails.
[03:26:09.536 --> 03:26:11.197]  People are going, this is criminal.
[03:26:11.197 --> 03:26:12.238]  We shouldn't be covering up.
[03:26:12.238 --> 03:26:13.239]  The Earth's getting colder.
[03:26:13.239 --> 03:26:19.143]  This is the head UN climatology unit at East Anglia in eastern England.
[03:26:21.809 --> 03:26:28.192]  But then, oh, it turns out before this even broke, they knew weeks ago it had been taken, so they destroyed it all!
[03:26:28.192 --> 03:26:38.618]  Then they figured out, ooh, that makes us even more obvious to be criminals, and so now because they've been caught engaged in fraud, I'm sure they'll engage in more fraud, and now claim they've released everything.
[03:26:38.618 --> 03:26:49.064]  So, yesterday, the headline in the Times of London, trying to find it here, got so many stacks sometimes, kind of out of control today,
[03:26:50.209 --> 03:26:56.715]  The headline was, here it is, give me a close shot on this, Times of London, climate change data dumped.
[03:26:56.715 --> 03:27:01.479]  Oh, we're sorry, it was all erased.
[03:27:01.479 --> 03:27:09.626]  And then now they're saying, oh gee, no, you've got to believe us, we actually do have all of the data.
[03:27:11.138 --> 03:27:12.738]  And we're going to be releasing that now.
[03:27:12.738 --> 03:27:22.761]  But their official story was, oh, we had so much data, we just threw it away, even though it was in the emails and documents, which we know they didn't dump.
[03:27:22.761 --> 03:27:24.141]  Then they claimed it was dumped.
[03:27:24.141 --> 03:27:25.541]  Talk about criminal activity.
[03:27:25.541 --> 03:27:28.002]  Now they're saying, oops, we do have it.
[03:27:28.002 --> 03:27:30.943]  So can we trust these liars to release the real data again?
[03:27:30.943 --> 03:27:36.984]  Well, that'll all be a distraction from their real internal data that's already been leaked, that they confirm was leaked.
[03:27:38.888 --> 03:27:49.719]  And I've noticed phony environmentalists online writing articles about how the emails are fake when the university and when NASA and others admit that these are their emails.
[03:27:49.719 --> 03:28:00.769]  It's kind of like two years ago, neocons were still on the radio saying WMDs were found in Iraq even though Bush admitted that they lied about it and WMDs weren't found.
[03:28:00.769 --> 03:28:02.291]  I mean, how stupid do they think we are?
[03:28:04.019 --> 03:28:11.624]  Well, they're counting on that percentage of the population that isn't really paying attention and just kind of halfway hears it and wants to rationalize and make excuses.
[03:28:11.624 --> 03:28:20.490]  It's kind of like the media says there's no world government, no carbon tax, no new world order being set up, even as world leaders call for it and try to pass it.
[03:28:20.490 --> 03:28:23.693]  Because that's for the mainline public that's dumbed down.
[03:28:23.693 --> 03:28:30.938]  They just put out that lie to neutralize whoever they can, so that when people hear us telling the truth, they think we're the liars.
[03:28:31.789 --> 03:28:34.751]  Well, hey, those emails aren't real.
[03:28:34.751 --> 03:28:36.032]  Saw it on the news.
[03:28:36.032 --> 03:28:39.195]  Hey, the news says polar bears can't swim, Alex.
[03:28:39.195 --> 03:28:44.079]  KXAN locally, three nights ago, had a news report saying polar bears couldn't swim again.
[03:28:44.079 --> 03:28:46.160]  Doesn't matter if that's a complete fraud.
[03:28:46.160 --> 03:28:48.302]  Doesn't matter if they hunt on ice flows.
[03:28:48.302 --> 03:28:51.505]  The media says, not true, polar bears can't swim.
[03:28:51.505 --> 03:28:52.686]  They're all dying.
[03:28:52.686 --> 03:28:54.367]  Doesn't matter if their numbers are up.
[03:28:54.367 --> 03:28:58.790]  A lot of people will still believe I'm lying when I say polar bear numbers have exploded.
[03:28:59.671 --> 03:29:05.509]  They will think I'm lying when I say polar bears are great swimmers and hunt seals and smaller whales out on the ice flows.
[03:29:06.448 --> 03:29:29.247]  But here it is, ClimateGate, University of East Anglia U-turn in climate change row, which means fight in English I guess, leading British scientists at the University of East Anglia who were accused, accused, it's confirmed in their own emails they say they're manipulating it, accused of manipulating climate change data, dubbed ClimateGate, have agreed to publish their figures in full.
[03:29:29.247 --> 03:29:30.769]  Yeah, I wonder what that definition means.
[03:29:32.329 --> 03:29:43.876]  The U-Turn by University follows a week of controversy after the emergence of hundreds of leaked emails stolen by hackers and published online, triggering claims that the academics had massage statistics.
[03:29:43.876 --> 03:29:45.277]  Claims?
[03:29:45.277 --> 03:29:46.638]  This is a whitewash, folks.
[03:29:46.638 --> 03:29:47.198]  It's on record.
[03:29:47.198 --> 03:29:49.660]  Look, climate change data dump.
[03:29:49.660 --> 03:29:52.041]  Then they say, oh, no, we have it.
[03:29:52.041 --> 03:29:53.422]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.422 --> 03:29:55.964]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.964 --> 03:29:58.646]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.385 --> 03:30:06.692]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.692 --> 03:30:11.218]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.218 --> 03:30:13.501]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.501 --> 03:30:15.123]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:15.123 --> 03:30:16.165]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.385 --> 03:30:24.814]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:30:24.814 --> 03:30:32.282]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[03:30:32.282 --> 03:30:37.948]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:30:38.288 --> 03:30:44.312]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:30:44.312 --> 03:30:48.475]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[03:30:48.475 --> 03:30:55.940]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[03:30:55.940 --> 03:30:59.242]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[03:31:01.345 --> 03:31:10.490]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:31:10.490 --> 03:31:13.852]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:31:13.852 --> 03:31:19.735]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:31:19.735 --> 03:31:24.498]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:31:24.498 --> 03:31:26.859]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:31:27.039 --> 03:31:27.439]  Thank you.
[03:31:45.953 --> 03:31:49.676]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit oxysilver.net.
[03:31:49.676 --> 03:31:51.857]  That's O-X-Y, silver.net.
[03:31:51.857 --> 03:31:58.382]  Or call about OxySilver, ZeoLife, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:31:58.382 --> 03:32:00.564]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[03:32:00.564 --> 03:32:01.224]  Do it now.
[03:32:01.224 --> 03:32:04.607]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:32:04.607 --> 03:32:08.229]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:32:08.229 --> 03:32:12.813]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:32:12.813 --> 03:32:14.234]  These emergency backup systems
[03:32:14.454 --> 03:32:17.336]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:32:17.336 --> 03:32:23.462]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:32:23.462 --> 03:32:27.085]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:32:27.085 --> 03:32:31.889]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:32:31.889 --> 03:32:38.474]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:32:38.474 --> 03:32:40.416]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:32:40.876 --> 03:32:44.098]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[03:32:44.098 --> 03:32:48.581]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[03:32:48.581 --> 03:32:50.382]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:32:50.382 --> 03:32:50.642]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[03:32:50.642 --> 03:32:50.703]  877-327-0365.
[03:32:50.703 --> 03:32:51.363]  Don't wait.
[03:32:51.363 --> 03:32:51.923]  Call today.
[03:32:51.923 --> 03:32:54.505]  As we've been trying to dump our wine spread.
[03:32:54.505 --> 03:32:55.966]  Much too long to rebuild.
[03:33:12.321 --> 03:33:15.443]  I've got a little bit more on Climategate and the economy.
[03:33:15.443 --> 03:33:17.965]  I'll cover some of that after we take some calls.
[03:33:17.965 --> 03:33:23.069]  Then I want to play the last ten minutes of the Charlie Sheen-Cristo Garcia interview yesterday.
[03:33:23.069 --> 03:33:25.130]  It was pretty powerful stuff.
[03:33:25.130 --> 03:33:29.373]  That interview, of course, is posted at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:33:29.373 --> 03:33:36.638]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that made today's show, radio transmission slash TV transmission possible.
[03:33:36.638 --> 03:33:38.679]  Survival Seed Bank.
[03:33:38.679 --> 03:33:39.980]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:33:41.636 --> 03:33:52.124]  In a real food crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[03:33:52.124 --> 03:33:56.988]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[03:33:56.988 --> 03:33:58.129]  Governments are storing seeds.
[03:33:58.129 --> 03:33:59.130]  The UN is storing seeds.
[03:33:59.130 --> 03:34:02.152]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[03:34:02.152 --> 03:34:03.473]  That's on record.
[03:34:03.473 --> 03:34:04.674]  Why do you think this is?
[03:34:04.674 --> 03:34:05.275]  You know why.
[03:34:05.275 --> 03:34:06.155]  Control and power.
[03:34:06.155 --> 03:34:07.076]  This loses from science.
[03:34:07.076 --> 03:34:10.539]  It's trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people.
[03:34:17.930 --> 03:34:20.631]  One seed bank at a time.
[03:34:20.631 --> 03:34:25.152]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[03:34:25.152 --> 03:34:29.353]  Order a couple of seed banks today while you still can at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:34:29.353 --> 03:34:33.054]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give Solutions from Science a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:34:33.054 --> 03:34:33.094]  877-327-0365.
[03:34:43.479 --> 03:34:46.541]  Continuing here with one other great sponsor, Front Sight.
[03:34:46.541 --> 03:34:49.983]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[03:34:49.983 --> 03:34:56.047]  The founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[03:34:56.047 --> 03:35:03.811]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal and it won't last forever, so listen up.
[03:35:03.811 --> 03:35:11.056]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:35:11.616 --> 03:35:17.418]  Act fast and they will give you a free, that's free, Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:35:17.418 --> 03:35:23.341]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed even law enforcement and military standards.
[03:35:23.341 --> 03:35:28.402]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:35:28.402 --> 03:35:31.884]  Thousands have already taken the advantage of this opportunity and you should too.
[03:35:31.884 --> 03:35:32.464]  Don't miss out.
[03:35:32.464 --> 03:35:34.585]  It's FrontSight.com.
[03:35:34.585 --> 03:35:40.027]  That's FrontSight.com or visit their links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.
[03:35:42.134 --> 03:35:52.523]  Okay, listen, I'm going to take your calls, but earlier, I took a lot of calls today, earlier in the first two hours, but I kind of will go four or five minutes with each caller.
[03:35:52.523 --> 03:35:54.484]  I want to get everybody on, so let's move quick.
[03:35:54.484 --> 03:35:57.947]  Robert in Europe, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:35:57.947 --> 03:35:59.608]  Just hung up as I went to him.
[03:35:59.608 --> 03:36:02.310]  Robert in California, you're on the air.
[03:36:02.310 --> 03:36:03.932]  Robert in San Diego, alright.
[03:36:03.932 --> 03:36:05.133]  Hey Alex, I love you man.
[03:36:05.133 --> 03:36:07.855]  And Lord Mocton, that guy is awesome, he totally rocks.
[03:36:08.450 --> 03:36:15.045]  I was listening to that poetic treatise given earlier that was power-packed and to the point and it made me write down some stuff about the climate gate.
[03:36:15.638 --> 03:36:20.001]  And first of all, the Climategate hackers, there should be amnesty for them.
[03:36:20.001 --> 03:36:21.182]  Let's start that right now.
[03:36:21.182 --> 03:36:27.046]  Well, more and more the media, it looks like we took the bait, called it hackers so it wouldn't be admissible in court.
[03:36:27.046 --> 03:36:33.470]  It's people inside the evidences that leaked it who were involved in research and didn't want to be prosecuted later.
[03:36:33.470 --> 03:36:39.654]  Because see, there was a FOIA request that almost got it released, but then their bosses colluded with government to block it.
[03:36:39.654 --> 03:36:41.916]  And so it looks like it's just whistleblowers.
[03:36:42.748 --> 03:36:46.630]  Alright, well, that poetic treatise made me write down just a really one-paragraph poem.
[03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:49.331]  It's called Al Gore, Pimper Whore.
[03:36:49.331 --> 03:36:51.792]  Carbon taxes for all the poor.
[03:36:51.792 --> 03:36:56.415]  Hear ye, hear ye, to all you feudal peasant slaves of the once great USA.
[03:36:56.415 --> 03:37:04.299]  Feeding the beast of blood and gore with all your trillions forevermore will never quench their lust, you see, to profit from your stupidity.
[03:37:04.299 --> 03:37:05.639]  I mean, come on, people!
[03:37:05.639 --> 03:37:08.261]  Carbon dioxide is what trees breathe!
[03:37:08.261 --> 03:37:08.601]  That's it.
[03:37:10.919 --> 03:37:12.180]  Very well said.
[03:37:12.180 --> 03:37:13.381]  Very well said, my friend.
[03:37:13.381 --> 03:37:29.853]  Speaking of blood and gore, there is a British fellow who works with gore in their climate exchange that you pay your taxes to, and they wrote an editorial, I've got here in my stack, for the Financial Times of London, Saturday,
[03:37:30.988 --> 03:37:34.270]  Saying, oh, we can't have a free market anymore.
[03:37:34.270 --> 03:37:38.071]  It's all going to be managed by us and global warming is going to kill everyone.
[03:37:38.071 --> 03:37:42.333]  And, you know, these guys are just desperate as they get exposed more and more.
[03:37:42.333 --> 03:37:48.776]  I mean, wasn't it not too long ago they said we're all going to die of an ice age.
[03:37:48.776 --> 03:37:50.597]  Then they came up with global warming.
[03:37:50.597 --> 03:37:51.958]  Now it's climate change.
[03:37:51.958 --> 03:37:56.720]  A word that seems to very well fit their fall since there's a tsunami of eternal resistors.
[03:37:57.398 --> 03:38:01.221]  And I just thank God for you being a true guardian, and God bless, Alex.
[03:38:01.221 --> 03:38:02.102]  Love you, man.
[03:38:02.102 --> 03:38:03.162]  I love that term.
[03:38:03.162 --> 03:38:05.184]  Eternal resistance to tyranny.
[03:38:05.184 --> 03:38:09.207]  I think Thomas Jefferson said that.
[03:38:09.207 --> 03:38:10.128]  Thank you, Robert.
[03:38:10.128 --> 03:38:11.008]  We love you, too.
[03:38:11.008 --> 03:38:12.029]  Reid in Alabama.
[03:38:12.029 --> 03:38:14.411]  Reid, you're on the air.
[03:38:14.411 --> 03:38:14.791]  Hey, Alex.
[03:38:14.791 --> 03:38:15.592]  How you doing?
[03:38:15.592 --> 03:38:18.454]  Good.
[03:38:18.454 --> 03:38:19.295]  Got a question for you.
[03:38:19.295 --> 03:38:25.920]  Do you ever research on the people that you happen to hire to work for you or volunteer to do such?
[03:38:27.247 --> 03:38:32.011]  Well, I've never had really a big enough office to hire too many people.
[03:38:32.011 --> 03:38:36.634]  But we, you know, we do do some research on the people we hire.
[03:38:36.634 --> 03:38:43.159]  Not because we're doing anything wrong here, but because feds and their informants will come in and try to commit crimes in our organization.
[03:38:43.159 --> 03:38:45.701]  They've been caught doing that to countless other people.
[03:38:45.701 --> 03:38:47.142]  But yeah, no, we do research.
[03:38:47.142 --> 03:38:48.543]  I mean, mainly I hire people
[03:38:49.420 --> 03:38:51.040]  Well that really wasn't what I was talking about.
[03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:52.781]  I was more specific about like your forums.
[03:38:52.781 --> 03:38:56.302]  Such people like Jack Travis and the fact that he scammed several people out of money.
[03:39:19.318 --> 03:39:27.239]  With his own gun company, and you had him on your radio show promoting his $30,000 money bomb in which his... Who?
[03:39:27.239 --> 03:39:27.999]  Hold on just a minute.
[03:39:27.999 --> 03:39:28.420]  Hold on.
[03:39:28.420 --> 03:39:29.080]  Hold on.
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:32.520]  I mean, we didn't screen your call calling in here, did we, sir?
[03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:33.360]  No.
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:37.661]  Okay, but people also say all my calls are fake.
[03:39:37.661 --> 03:39:39.521]  What's this person's name again?
[03:39:39.521 --> 03:39:40.382]  Jack Travis.
[03:39:40.382 --> 03:39:41.402]  It goes by J.T.
[03:39:41.402 --> 03:39:43.662]  Coyote.
[03:39:43.662 --> 03:39:44.322]  Oh, I know him.
[03:39:44.322 --> 03:39:47.943]  I've had him on the show whenever the police... he had a...
[03:39:49.542 --> 03:39:53.245]  Realtor in his house, and they saw reloading equipment and called the police on him.
[03:39:53.245 --> 03:39:54.947]  And that was in the paper, so we had him on.
[03:39:54.947 --> 03:39:58.109]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:39:58.109 --> 03:39:59.150]  Forum moderators.
[03:39:59.150 --> 03:40:03.754]  Paul Watson runs the Prison Planet Forum.
[03:40:03.754 --> 03:40:07.977]  And just like any other forum, we end up getting moderators.
[03:40:07.977 --> 03:40:14.302]  And separate from JT Coyote, we've had other people
[03:40:15.302 --> 03:40:19.044]  Like, I didn't even know what you're talking about, about him having a money bomb.
[03:40:19.044 --> 03:40:30.511]  I mean, I can't keep track of my own email and things I'm doing, and I'm so tempted to get rid of the Prison Planet Forum, because it has caused us a lot of problems.
[03:40:30.511 --> 03:40:40.597]  But it also, so much good information gets posted, there's so much happens, but I can't sit here with what people are saying with a forum, or what's going on, or what's happening with a forum.
[03:40:41.757 --> 03:40:50.640]  You know, we've had other people that were forum moderators that have caused problems that we've gotten rid of, and then they attack us and tell lies about us, and it's just an endless source of problems.
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:41:00.584]  But, you look at the internet, it's all built and based on user content, on people posting and talking.
[03:41:00.584 --> 03:41:06.726]  You know, I got a visit from the FBI, and I got subpoenaed, and in the subpoena there was a gag order.
[03:41:07.679 --> 03:41:14.967]  From the federal court in California, not to talk about it, because they didn't want the person they were going after to be able to flee.
[03:41:14.967 --> 03:41:19.832]  And I said on air, we've been visited by the FBI, and people said, oh, you're a liar.
[03:41:19.832 --> 03:41:22.315]  Tell us who the FBI was, tell us why.
[03:41:22.315 --> 03:41:27.521]  And then later it came out in the Associated Press and Wired Magazine, what happened, what went on.
[03:41:31.195 --> 03:41:39.318]  I mean, I'm here doing a radio show, and what you do on the internet, decisions you make on the internet, that's your issue.
[03:41:39.318 --> 03:41:41.138]  Paul Watts, here's the problem.
[03:41:41.138 --> 03:41:53.042]  I don't have the funds and the money to run the forums, to run the comment pages right, because I would probably have to hire five people that I don't have money to hire just to sit in there
[03:41:54.332 --> 03:42:01.084]  Cutting out anything, policing people, making sure people don't run their own operations, their own side things.
[03:42:01.084 --> 03:42:05.251]  I mean, there's spam all over InfoWars and Prison Planet comments.
[03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:10.110]  And people will spam every article with their products or what they're doing.
[03:42:10.110 --> 03:42:11.971]  People will then go buy the product.
[03:42:11.971 --> 03:42:14.411]  They don't like the product and they blame me.
[03:42:14.411 --> 03:42:15.892]  I have no control over that.
[03:42:15.892 --> 03:42:23.714]  And then, if somebody spams everywhere, we have a computer program in there that if somebody spams the same term over and over again, it's a spam filter.
[03:42:23.714 --> 03:42:25.874]  Then they accuse me of censorship.
[03:42:25.874 --> 03:42:29.635]  Censorship would be if I came and shut down your website.
[03:42:29.635 --> 03:42:31.276]  Censorship would be if
[03:42:33.530 --> 03:42:35.051]  I mean, it's so frustrating.
[03:42:35.051 --> 03:42:37.473]  Censorship would be if I stopped your free speech.
[03:42:37.473 --> 03:42:47.399]  It's not censorship if I erase somebody's comment on Infowars or Prison Planet or on the forum calling for murdering people.
[03:42:47.399 --> 03:42:49.740]  That is not censorship.
[03:42:49.740 --> 03:43:01.608]  Or if somebody types the same term in hundreds of times per post and then the spam filter kicks in, thinking it's spam because it is, then they squeal and yell.
[03:43:03.217 --> 03:43:17.961]  I will say this, if some rich person wants to step forward and give me a yearly donation, if I paid people $20,000 a year, I could hire 5 people.
[03:43:17.961 --> 03:43:20.162]  Pretty close to minimum wage.
[03:43:20.162 --> 03:43:26.463]  I could hire 5 people so that the weekends would be covered and 24 hours a day we'd have a night time person.
[03:43:28.573 --> 03:43:29.913]  I could do that.
[03:43:29.913 --> 03:43:32.014]  Or I could just shut it all down.
[03:43:32.014 --> 03:43:37.355]  But I almost hate to give in to people that are going wild all over the sites and all over the place.
[03:43:37.355 --> 03:43:40.316]  And I'm not saying the person you called in is a bad guy.
[03:43:40.316 --> 03:43:40.716]  I don't know.
[03:43:40.716 --> 03:43:42.557]  He seems like a nice guy.
[03:43:42.557 --> 03:43:45.318]  But also a lot of people go and become forum people or whatever.
[03:43:45.318 --> 03:43:51.119]  That's why we don't have moderators on InfoWars and Prison Planet because they set up their own little petty kingdoms.
[03:43:51.119 --> 03:43:52.640]  And I don't know how all this works.
[03:43:55.526 --> 03:43:59.010]  Maybe we should have a listener vote and just go ahead and get rid of all of it.
[03:43:59.010 --> 03:44:07.438]  Because the biggest reason I don't start a radio network of my own with Ted Anderson and have all these hosts under me, is I don't want to be responsible for what they say and do.
[03:44:07.438 --> 03:44:10.321]  I want my message to be my message.
[03:44:10.321 --> 03:44:11.403]  You know?
[03:44:11.403 --> 03:44:13.385]  I want to be pure about what I'm doing.
[03:44:13.385 --> 03:44:18.190]  But when you work with other people, it can't stay pure.
[03:44:19.755 --> 03:44:32.199]  But then I also want 99% of the stuff on the forum and the comments is great, informative information.
[03:44:32.199 --> 03:44:39.162]  So donate to us, support us financially, so we can hire the people to make this better.
[03:44:39.162 --> 03:44:41.682]  But I mean, we're victims of our own success.
[03:44:41.682 --> 03:44:45.144]  We're not really successful monetarily.
[03:44:45.144 --> 03:44:49.245]  We are to a certain extent to be able to grow to the point we have, but at the same time,
[03:44:52.438 --> 03:44:59.903]  Because we are so successful reaching people, we have millions of people a week coming to us, millions a day in many cases, and I can't even keep track of it.
[03:44:59.903 --> 03:45:04.247]  I mean, a lot of times, I'm the guy carrying the trash out up here.
[03:45:04.247 --> 03:45:09.250]  You know, I'm the guy that's gotta, you know, sometimes tell people, because I don't really micromanage them to get up off their butts.
[03:45:09.250 --> 03:45:13.013]  Most people work real hard up here.
[03:45:13.013 --> 03:45:15.075]  And see, that just burned all our time for calls.
[03:45:15.075 --> 03:45:19.038]  I don't have time to go to everybody else because I promised to play this clip and hit a few other news items.
[03:45:20.074 --> 03:45:25.715]  I always say I'm going to go to calls quickly, but the good, the bad, and the ugly, it all takes time to discuss in any... Look, I know this.
[03:45:25.715 --> 03:45:27.976]  I'm not the IRS coming and taking your house.
[03:45:27.976 --> 03:45:30.777]  I'm not the Copenhagen Treaty stuff.
[03:45:30.777 --> 03:45:33.037]  Ron Paul isn't doing that to you.
[03:45:33.037 --> 03:45:36.838]  And so, forum moderators don't work for me.
[03:45:36.838 --> 03:45:39.219]  It's people Watson's tried to choose.
[03:45:39.219 --> 03:45:41.319]  We do need to police things more.
[03:45:41.319 --> 03:45:49.181]  And we need to have a rule to all the forum people that if they advertise their own businesses or own operations, when they're... I guess we just can't allow any solicitation.
[03:45:49.721 --> 03:45:54.166]  In fact, I'm ordering the moderators, unless they don't want to be moderators anymore, no more solicitation!
[03:45:54.166 --> 03:45:58.890]  You can have solicitation to political events and things, but no more sales of other stuff.
[03:45:59.639 --> 03:46:00.979]  Or we're just going to ban you?
[03:46:00.979 --> 03:46:02.900]  Because I can't deal with this.
[03:46:02.900 --> 03:46:12.743]  I can't deal with a couple hundred thousand people a week in the Prison Planet Forum, all fighting with each other and crapping on each other.
[03:46:12.743 --> 03:46:14.183]  That's what America is, though.
[03:46:14.183 --> 03:46:15.964]  I mean, that's what we've become.
[03:46:15.964 --> 03:46:20.725]  And I can't let all that overshadow my mission and what I'm doing.
[03:46:20.725 --> 03:46:28.167]  And so, I'm busy with a lot of other projects, but I've been procrastinating on a decision on the forums, on the comments.
[03:46:30.714 --> 03:46:33.055]  Maybe we need to shut it down for a few weeks and purge.
[03:46:33.055 --> 03:46:35.216]  In fact, I'm making the decision right now.
[03:46:35.216 --> 03:46:37.217]  I don't want the forum erased.
[03:46:37.217 --> 03:46:39.077]  I want the forum locked down now.
[03:46:39.077 --> 03:46:42.759]  It's like when you have a disease, you need a fever to burn it out.
[03:46:42.759 --> 03:46:51.062]  I want the forum locked and I want the comments closed on InfoWars until we at least get one or two people in here to try to control this.
[03:46:52.401 --> 03:47:03.307]  And that means we gotta hire him and I'm just gonna beg for more money here and try to sling more videos and promote things because, you know, we're trying to fight the New World Order here and I'm sick of distractions.
[03:47:03.307 --> 03:47:07.150]  So, forum shut down for now and are the comments.
[03:47:07.150 --> 03:47:08.971]  Shut them all down right now.
[03:47:08.971 --> 03:47:10.472]  You want it, you got it.
[03:47:10.472 --> 03:47:12.493]  Because I've already been thinking about this for a long time.
[03:47:12.493 --> 03:47:14.034]  This will force me to make a decision on it.
[03:47:14.964 --> 03:47:16.085]  We'll put it in purgatory.
[03:47:16.085 --> 03:47:18.708]  Can't put it in heaven or hell, I'll put it in purgatory.
[03:47:18.708 --> 03:47:22.112]  Let's go ahead now and go to the Charlie Sheen, part of the Charlie Sheen interview.
[03:47:22.112 --> 03:47:28.659]  Something constructive, something informative, something good, something pure, and then we'll go out to break and come back and finish up.
[03:47:28.659 --> 03:47:28.980]  Here it is.
[03:47:30.031 --> 03:47:41.084]  Well, he had an idea, Charlie Sheen, director, producer, TV star, film star, and it has grown and grown.
[03:47:41.084 --> 03:47:44.327]  20minuteswiththepresident.com or infowars.com.
[03:47:44.327 --> 03:47:47.271]  Christo Garcia, the winner, first place, $14,000 paid by Charlie.
[03:47:48.952 --> 03:47:51.014]  I said we'll have second and third place.
[03:47:51.014 --> 03:47:51.635]  I'll pay that.
[03:47:51.635 --> 03:47:53.596]  I'm going to be covering that the next few days.
[03:47:53.596 --> 03:47:58.500]  It was a lot of other great entries, but Christo's really was a cut above the rest.
[03:47:58.500 --> 03:48:00.162]  We appreciate everybody's effort.
[03:48:00.162 --> 03:48:05.166]  Everyone wins by participating in telling the truth.
[03:48:05.166 --> 03:48:10.731]  Going back to Charlie Sheen, Charlie, when we talk privately, you discuss integrity.
[03:48:10.731 --> 03:48:13.493]  At the end of the day is all that matters.
[03:48:13.493 --> 03:48:16.536]  And I know this 20 minutes with the president is
[03:48:17.156 --> 03:48:19.356]  Really feeling good right now, doing the right thing?
[03:48:19.356 --> 03:48:20.537]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[03:48:20.537 --> 03:48:21.217]  Absolutely.
[03:48:21.217 --> 03:48:38.861]  And the response to it, regardless of how the mainstream media dealt with it, if you read the blogs and the postings and everything else, you can see that it really struck something with the people.
[03:48:38.861 --> 03:48:40.141]  It really struck something.
[03:48:41.949 --> 03:48:45.592]  You know, reignited the truth movement on some level.
[03:48:45.592 --> 03:48:52.858]  It just, you know, even, you know, people on the street would come up to me randomly and say, you know, I didn't believe any of that crap until I read your piece.
[03:48:52.858 --> 03:48:54.559]  And I went, oh, wait a minute.
[03:48:54.559 --> 03:48:57.922]  A lot of that stuff is hard to debate or disassemble.
[03:48:57.922 --> 03:49:01.425]  And it's, wow, man, you've really opened my eyes.
[03:49:01.425 --> 03:49:03.146]  And I'm going to start spreading the word.
[03:49:03.146 --> 03:49:03.647]  And it's like,
[03:49:04.307 --> 03:49:14.175]  You know, it's like I told you at the beginning of this thing, if we can, you know, change one person's view, and then they tell one person and so on, that's how any movement begins.
[03:49:14.175 --> 03:49:25.064]  And so, you know, I don't look at this as, you know, 20 minutes with the President as any kind of a failure, because we didn't wind up on Larry King Live or, you know, GMA or whatever.
[03:49:25.064 --> 03:49:28.867]  You know, I look at it as a real victory and as a real hope.
[03:49:31.625 --> 03:49:46.088]  Well, it was a total success, but every time we got the emails, or you got them, and you were sending them to me, it was, we want to interview you for the news, and you knew they could cut all that up.
[03:49:46.088 --> 03:49:54.870]  When you wanted a 50-50 live debate, they would not give it to you, because they wanted to be able to manipulate and play with what you were saying.
[03:49:57.413 --> 03:49:58.494]  It's what they do.
[03:49:58.494 --> 03:49:59.274]  It's how they do it.
[03:49:59.274 --> 03:50:05.278]  It's what they do all day every day.
[03:50:05.278 --> 03:50:17.884]  As long as they've got them as their mouthpiece, then... I don't want to say we're stuck in an uphill struggle, but we've got our work cut out for us, people.
[03:50:17.884 --> 03:50:19.065]  There's no question about that.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:26.902]  At the same time, the mainstream controlled corporate press is not going to tell us how much success we've had.
[03:50:26.902 --> 03:50:29.623]  Charlie, you talk about people on the street coming up to you.
[03:50:29.623 --> 03:50:34.985]  I've been with you when people come up and they bring up 9-11 Truth and thank you for what you've done.
[03:50:34.985 --> 03:50:39.886]  But I'm just little old Alex Jones with a radio show and documentary films I make.
[03:50:39.886 --> 03:50:41.847]  My cousin was visiting from Chicago.
[03:50:41.847 --> 03:50:47.408]  It was my dad's birthday, so we were getting food for the party and buying a late gift.
[03:50:47.408 --> 03:50:48.809]  And literally in Austin,
[03:50:49.509 --> 03:50:58.180]  Every person we walked into, every person in the parking lot, all the people at the gas station, the guy behind the counter, everyone!
[03:50:58.180 --> 03:51:01.224]  I mean, it was like a hallucination!
[03:51:04.562 --> 03:51:09.084]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[03:51:09.084 --> 03:51:12.425]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[03:51:12.425 --> 03:51:17.286]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[03:51:17.286 --> 03:51:21.928]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:34.297]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[03:51:34.297 --> 03:51:37.619]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[03:51:37.619 --> 03:51:40.861]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:51:40.861 --> 03:51:44.184]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[03:51:44.184 --> 03:51:47.306]  Or go to my website at TaxHelpOnline.com.
[03:51:47.306 --> 03:51:52.069]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[03:51:52.569 --> 03:51:54.170]  Call us today 800-346-6829.
[03:51:54.170 --> 03:52:03.336]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:52:03.336 --> 03:52:07.358]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.358 --> 03:52:10.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:12.041]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.719 --> 03:52:15.400]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.400 --> 03:52:21.784]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.784 --> 03:52:27.326]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.326 --> 03:52:36.951]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.071 --> 03:52:39.432]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.432 --> 03:52:41.012]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.012 --> 03:52:43.473]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.473 --> 03:52:45.594]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.594 --> 03:52:50.736]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.736 --> 03:52:55.758]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:11.084]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:54:11.084 --> 03:54:14.046]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:29.238 --> 03:54:30.979]  Okay, go ahead and roll that audio.
[03:54:30.979 --> 03:54:33.842]  Charlie Sheen, here we go.
[03:54:33.842 --> 03:54:38.585]  Yeah, that's Lord Monckton.
[03:54:38.585 --> 03:54:40.347]  That's the wrong interview, guys.
[03:54:40.347 --> 03:54:42.348]  Just forget it.
[03:54:42.348 --> 03:54:43.089]  Just forget it.
[03:54:43.089 --> 03:54:44.290]  It's alright, because we're out of time.
[03:54:44.290 --> 03:54:46.451]  You know, the show just runs out of time.
[03:54:46.451 --> 03:54:52.916]  The Charlie Sheen interview was amazing, and it's posted in full at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:52.916 --> 03:54:53.396]  It's alright.
[03:54:53.396 --> 03:54:54.217]  It's too late now.
[03:54:57.862 --> 03:55:00.967]  As for the forum, I don't want everybody to freak out about this.
[03:55:00.967 --> 03:55:03.110]  I've been procrastinating too long.
[03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:10.301]  We can't be doing the important work we're doing and not have a handle from my office on what's going on with the Prison Planet Forum.
[03:55:11.181 --> 03:55:17.847]  I mean, you let people do whatever they want is a constant irritant, a constant distraction from what I'm doing.
[03:55:17.847 --> 03:55:20.128]  So much good stuff is there as well.
[03:55:20.128 --> 03:55:38.463]  I just have to shut it down for a while to make myself stop procrastinating, to get some of my own people moderating it, and to codify some really serious rules for people, or it becomes a free-for-all and it allows infiltrators and problem people to come in and just do whatever they want.
[03:55:39.304 --> 03:55:46.528]  As for InfoWars and Prison Planet, the comment sections, I mean, people will say something racist in the first comment.
[03:55:46.528 --> 03:55:51.470]  We can check their IP and it'll be a Fed trying to get us all fighting with each other.
[03:55:51.470 --> 03:55:57.794]  Or they'll say, first, on purpose, even though they're not the first commenter to get everybody to say, oh, you're an idiot, because they don't want you organizing.
[03:55:57.794 --> 03:55:59.074]  They don't want you talking.
[03:55:59.074 --> 03:56:00.495]  They don't want you meeting.
[03:56:00.495 --> 03:56:05.718]  You know, I've meant to build something where it's like Meetup,
[03:56:11.231 --> 03:56:16.975]  Where everybody has their own little page, and then people meet like-minded people locally.
[03:56:16.975 --> 03:56:19.497]  We're building that for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:56:19.497 --> 03:56:25.662]  It's just a money issue of having the IT people getting it done, getting these projects done, and we keep expanding what we're doing.
[03:56:25.662 --> 03:56:33.469]  But clearly this open format of just, hey, Wild West free-for-all is a problem.
[03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:38.913]  And so I'm going to just lock those up the next few days to make myself focus on
[03:56:40.825 --> 03:56:51.731]  On cleaning it up, doing an investigation, finding out what's going on, and giving moderators the rules, and if they violate them, we're going to ban them.
[03:56:51.731 --> 03:56:56.533]  Because, I mean, everybody knows about the Internet, who's been on the Internet.
[03:56:56.533 --> 03:56:57.894]  It's just a mess.
[03:56:57.894 --> 03:56:59.954]  But there's also so much good stuff happening.
[03:56:59.954 --> 03:57:03.956]  Look at ClimateGate, how the mainstream media in the past could have ignored this.
[03:57:03.956 --> 03:57:06.878]  They can't now because the alternative media drives it out in the open.
[03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:08.170]  I don't
[03:57:29.011 --> 03:57:38.676]  It's hard for people to screw something up like Fall of the Republic or Obama deception that we sell the DVDs of that support our operation, but we also give out for free on YouTube and Google.
[03:57:38.676 --> 03:57:42.498]  It's hard for people to screw that up.
[03:57:42.498 --> 03:57:47.520]  It's over 100 million people conservatively that have seen our films online that we know of.
[03:57:47.520 --> 03:57:48.781]  That is effective.
[03:57:48.781 --> 03:57:49.922]  That is great.
[03:57:49.922 --> 03:57:54.564]  And I can't let all this other stuff become a distraction and jeopardize what I'm doing.
[03:57:56.311 --> 03:58:08.096]  Because we're also so successful that we get attacked from all angles, not just through COINTELPRO, but through just jealous, envious people that are jealous of our energy, our passion, our courage.
[03:58:08.096 --> 03:58:11.537]  So I want to salute We Are Change Chicago and others for confronting Al Gore.
[03:58:11.537 --> 03:58:12.778]  Couldn't have done it better.
[03:58:12.778 --> 03:58:13.558]  You are beautiful.
[03:58:13.558 --> 03:58:15.559]  We got those folks coming up later in the week.
[03:58:15.559 --> 03:58:18.000]  Some big surprise guests as well.
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:21.341]  We took a lot of great phone calls, covered a lot of key news today.
[03:58:21.341 --> 03:58:24.343]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:25.623 --> 03:58:29.587]  And we'll be posting the video from this show as well, along with the audio, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:58:29.587 --> 03:58:31.789]  You can get five months free right now.
[03:58:31.789 --> 03:58:34.091]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[03:58:34.091 --> 03:58:36.032]  They make what we do here possible.
[03:58:36.032 --> 03:58:37.594]  So I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:58:37.594 --> 03:58:38.375]  God bless you all.
[03:58:38.375 --> 03:58:41.998]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:41.998 --> 03:58:47.723]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:47.723 --> 03:58:50.946]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:52.267 --> 03:58:55.268]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:55.268 --> 03:59:00.591]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:59:00.591 --> 03:59:02.651]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:59:02.651 --> 03:59:07.654]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:07.654 --> 03:59:08.834]  How much do you want?
[03:59:08.834 --> 03:59:09.955]  When do you want it?
[03:59:09.955 --> 03:59:11.835]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:11.835 --> 03:59:12.916]  When will you need it?
[03:59:12.916 --> 03:59:15.117]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:15.117 --> 03:59:16.457]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:16.457 --> 03:59:17.758]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:17.978 --> 03:59:23.243]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:23.243 --> 03:59:26.827]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:26.827 --> 03:59:30.651]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:30.651 --> 03:59:31.892]  How much will you need?
[03:59:31.892 --> 03:59:32.773]  We don't know.
[03:59:32.773 --> 03:59:33.894]  How much do you want?
[03:59:33.894 --> 03:59:34.815]  All you can get.
[03:59:34.815 --> 03:59:35.616]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:35.896 --> 03:59:38.938]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:59:38.938 --> 03:59:40.718]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:40.718 --> 03:59:41.819]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:41.819 --> 03:59:45.901]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
