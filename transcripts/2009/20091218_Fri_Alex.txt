[00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:11.147]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:12.728]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:14.289]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:25.298]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:35.906]  Well, as of an hour ago, we have the latest draft, which the media is reporting may be the final draft of the Global Government Treaty.
[00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:40.337]  The Global Governance Treaty.
[00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:43.958]  The most important meeting in the history of the United Nations.
[00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.240]  And that is in their words, and it certainly is.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.500]  And it has the global tax.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.101]  It has the 2% tax on all nations.
[00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.423]  It has a money transfer tax in it.
[00:00:55.423 --> 00:00:58.784]  It is just unbelievably corrupt.
[00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:03.326]  And it gives the private IMF and World Bank that the taxes are paid to
[00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:10.026]  The power to selectively enforce the rules.
[00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:17.089]  We'll be discussing that on this Friday, the 18th day of December, 2009 edition.
[00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:30.615]  I've seen some comments on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I've gotten a few emails saying, why are you spending so much time on ClimateGate and not more time on government takeover of healthcare?
[00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:31.896]  Well, you must not be listening.
[00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:35.808]  We've been spending a lot of time on government health care.
[00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:37.848]  We're trying to beat it in the Senate.
[00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:41.849]  If that doesn't work, we have a chance to beat it in the House.
[00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.589]  Right now, the momentum is shifting in our direction.
[00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:49.110]  But that has been widely debated all over the United States.
[00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.791]  The people know about the prison time, the five years if you don't get prison, the quarter million dollar fine.
[00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:59.632]  We've been beating the drum for the last six months fighting it.
[00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.392]  And it's important.
[00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:05.632]  But you can always repeal government healthcare.
[00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:06.913]  It'll be hard to do.
[00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:10.335]  We can fight at the state level as well.
[00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:13.878]  We can always fight the death panels.
[00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:30.930]  As big as government takeover of healthcare is, quite frankly, it's nothing compared to open world government being established and the president signing us onto a treaty and saying he doesn't care if Congress doesn't implement it,
[00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.144]  That the United States will submit to global governance.
[00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:39.667]  And he's up there demonizing America as this great evil.
[00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:40.347]  This is a U.N.
[00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:40.928]  speech today.
[00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:43.549]  We're going to be playing it.
[00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.871]  And we've got to pay for our evil carbon.
[00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.373]  I mean, this is complete fraud.
[00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:53.997]  And in the next segment, I'm going to play the audio from the President's entire speech.
[00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:56.679]  It's only ten and a half minutes long, and I'm going to stop and start
[00:02:57.685 --> 00:03:05.673]  Briefly just pointing out the lies, but it's a fabric of lies, a tissue of lies, a compendium of lies.
[00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:08.515]  It is a infinity of lies.
[00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:16.383]  There's so many lies and so many intricacies you could analyze the lies and fraud of this forever.
[00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:21.608]  Because it just ties into so many facets of government and the corrupt system we live under.
[00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:26.271]  We are not just covering the climate gate fraud.
[00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:30.755]  We're not just covering whether man-made global warming is real or not.
[00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:46.949]  We're discussing the issue of a dictatorial planetary government being established that once established is going to force global one-child policies, force drugging of the population, force sterilization and abortion!
[00:03:48.766 --> 00:04:03.138]  This is already going on in India and China and areas of Africa and Latin America where the UN comes in and pays off the governments to carry out sterilization, arrest, forced drugging.
[00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:06.101]  It's all part of history.
[00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:10.444]  And we now have Fox News promoting putting lithium in the water.
[00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:11.365]  I got news for you.
[00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:12.106]  They're already doing it.
[00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:23.920]  So, global government, the end of America, the president, in a treasonous fashion, signing onto it, as he's swearing to do this evening.
[00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:39.807]  He says, in fact, even if it doesn't pass, even if they can't get the other dictatorships and communist countries to sign on, because it's too tyrannical, he says he's going to unilaterally implement it over the American people, to the UN.
[00:04:39.807 --> 00:04:45.790]  He's bringing us under UN IMF World Bank receivership, whether we like it or not.
[00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.272]  Now that's the biggest news out there, period!
[00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:50.713]  And that's what we're going to be covering.
[00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:58.985]  Of course, the COINTELPRO is very angry that we're rallying the people to defeat it.
[00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:02.106]  But your propaganda won't work!
[00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:05.106]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:10.447]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:12.488]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:12.488 --> 00:05:17.489]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:18.409]  How much do you want?
[00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.790]  When do you want it?
[00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.671]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:22.751]  When will you need it?
[00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:24.952]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:26.293]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.814]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:27.814 --> 00:05:33.097]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:33.097 --> 00:05:36.679]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:40.141]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:41.723]  How much will you need?
[00:05:41.723 --> 00:05:42.624]  We don't know.
[00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:43.725]  How much do you want?
[00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:44.666]  All you can get.
[00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:45.747]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:45.747 --> 00:05:48.811]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:51.494]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.141 --> 00:06:05.242]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:06:05.242 --> 00:06:08.103]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:10.204]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.444]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.105]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:06.300]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.846]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:13.109]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:14.751]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:15.773]  There is a solution.
[00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:24.422]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:11.590]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.171]  You want answers?
[00:08:13.171 --> 00:08:14.112]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.112 --> 00:08:18.915]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:26.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.682]  It is Friday, the 18th day of December 2009.
[00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:29.462]  As we hurdle into 2010,
[00:08:34.878 --> 00:08:47.209]  Here's Corbin, a top meteorologist, one of the most world famous out there for accurately predicting the weather even a year in advance.
[00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:48.710]  He is world famous.
[00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.753]  He's been exposing the climate fraudsters for what they are.
[00:08:53.584 --> 00:09:01.708]  He will be joining us in T-minus 23 minutes from now on this Friday edition.
[00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:09.112]  Wayne Madsen will be popping in, coming up in the middle of the next hour on a host of global issues.
[00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:19.398]  And we're also going to be talking to John Schaefer of a very popular rock band that's on scores of Billboard charts right now.
[00:09:21.124 --> 00:09:28.331]  He is with the band Iced Earth, but he is releasing today here on this radio show.
[00:09:28.331 --> 00:09:30.994]  We're very honored that he contacted us to do this.
[00:09:30.994 --> 00:09:34.377]  Much of my crew are fans of Iced Earth.
[00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:39.342]  Iced Earth has been around for a long time.
[00:09:39.342 --> 00:09:41.043]  They are putting out a free
[00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:44.215]  Album.
[00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:45.756]  And I've listened to a lot of their music.
[00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:47.696]  I think this is one of their best albums.
[00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:53.117]  But because of the record label and things, they're putting it out under the title, uh, Sons of Liberty.
[00:09:53.117 --> 00:09:54.818]  Because it's free.
[00:09:54.818 --> 00:09:58.379]  And of course, you can't have a record label that lets you put something out free.
[00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:02.099]  So they, the band, put this out separately themselves, for free!
[00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:06.481]  And let me tell ya, it's some of the best work I've heard from Iced Earth.
[00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.081]  Uh, and it is, uh, just amazing.
[00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:12.382]  In fact, I had a folder in here that had all the, uh,
[00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:29.157]  Lyrics for Iced Earth in the Fed in the Fed the answer to 1984 is 1776 I'm setting bushfires in the minds of men You can better believe this radio show in our work and Ron Paul's work is a big
[00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:36.243]  Big influence on some of the latest music from Iced Earth, who reached millions of fans.
[00:10:36.243 --> 00:10:39.044]  So we're excited about having him in here for a full hour.
[00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:45.947]  Of course, it's the end of the Copenhagen event, the global government establishing event, and it is an Iced Earth there.
[00:10:45.947 --> 00:10:51.390]  Record cold temperatures right now in Denmark and in Canada and in other areas of the world.
[00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.871]  It was snowing a week and a half ago in Houston, Texas.
[00:10:54.451 --> 00:11:03.843]  That's generally basically tropical down on the Gulf of Mexico entering into the mouth of the Caribbean.
[00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:08.509]  So that is coming up later in the broadcast today.
[00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:09.510]  Oh, and we have
[00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:18.344]  Robert Wannick, the high school student, who's won some of our contest awards, an active 9-11 truther.
[00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:26.306]  Robert Wannick got beat up by a teacher and suspended for handing out flu vaccine inserts.
[00:11:26.306 --> 00:11:34.168]  You hand out the actual inserts that say it can give you cancer, sterilize you, kill you, give you Guillain-Barré or Gillian-Barré in English.
[00:11:36.676 --> 00:11:37.916]  Has mercury in it.
[00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:39.697]  It's all admitted in the insert.
[00:11:39.697 --> 00:11:43.198]  You try to hand that out, they get very angry.
[00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:49.681]  And he's got witnesses to the fact that he was assaulted in America by this particular school teacher.
[00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:53.502]  And so he will be joining us to talk about this today.
[00:11:53.502 --> 00:12:01.285]  It's funny watching Wanek the last two years go from like a 13-year-old kid to now the chin and the hormones going up and he's turning into a man.
[00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:06.448]  It's amazing to see that transformation.
[00:12:06.448 --> 00:12:20.618]  He was a little kid a few years ago, fighting the New World Order, and now he... Let's just hope he can get out of high school without them setting him up and sending him down the river for daring to be a thought criminal.
[00:12:20.618 --> 00:12:24.441]  So that is coming up today.
[00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:26.582]  Okay, here's what I want to do right now.
[00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:28.784]  This is a ten and a half minute clip.
[00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:39.946]  And in the rest of this segment, the next segment, I want to attempt to play the Obama speech and then stop it and make quick comments about his lies.
[00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:46.592]  If I don't finish now, I'll finish this later when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv so you can watch the teleprompter reader.
[00:12:46.592 --> 00:12:49.875]  He doesn't have a teleprompter here, so he's having a lot of trouble.
[00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:56.660]  And here he is, the media said he was angry, he was desperate, he commits America even if the rest of the countries don't sign on.
[00:12:57.381 --> 00:12:59.783]  And it's just all lies.
[00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:18.434]  So we're gonna now critique and translate and break down the manifest congenital fraud of Barack H. Obama today in Copenhagen, Denmark, trying to force through, according to what Ban Ki-moon says, the birth of world government.
[00:13:18.434 --> 00:13:18.814]  Here it is.
[00:13:21.812 --> 00:13:28.840]  It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.966]  We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave
[00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:52.962]  Okay, he just states that it's an absolute fact, like the unified corporate press has been doing, that it poses a great danger, we've got to establish the global government, you've got to pay these taxes to us, or basically the earth is doomed.
[00:13:52.962 --> 00:13:54.682]  I mean, just fraud.
[00:13:54.682 --> 00:13:55.102]  Continue.
[00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:09.750]  All of you would not be here unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.231]  Hit pause.
[00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:25.122]  Okay, from the 191 governments, there are conservatively, on record, more than 50 of the delegates there who are questioning man-made climate change and questioning Climategate.
[00:14:25.122 --> 00:14:30.627]  And there are heads of state from many of these governments who are publicly saying it is a fraud.
[00:14:32.435 --> 00:14:35.776]  But there he said, you are all here, you are all here in agreement.
[00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:43.240]  He just keeps stating the lie that everyone knows the earth is doomed, everyone knows we've got to have the global tax, everyone is in agreement.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:50.183]  So he just keeps stating the Borg lie that not only will you be assimilated, you have been assimilated.
[00:14:50.183 --> 00:14:52.884]  Just all lies, every word, continue.
[00:14:52.884 --> 00:14:55.665]  That this danger is real.
[00:14:55.665 --> 00:14:57.026]  This is not fiction.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.301]  It is science.
[00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.381]  Hit pause.
[00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:01.442]  Back it up.
[00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:02.263]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[00:15:02.263 --> 00:15:04.964]  I want people to hear all this again.
[00:15:04.964 --> 00:15:08.286]  So, again, he says, you're all here because you want to save the earth.
[00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:10.068]  All of you are in agreement.
[00:15:10.068 --> 00:15:11.488]  You know this is real.
[00:15:11.488 --> 00:15:13.330]  It's not some fiction.
[00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:22.936]  Now, what you just heard is just, and the body language says it, it's like Bill Clinton when he shook his finger and said, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:15:22.936 --> 00:15:24.597]  Or, read my lips, no new taxes.
[00:15:25.606 --> 00:15:27.669]  When everybody heard it, they knew it was a lie.
[00:15:27.669 --> 00:15:33.177]  When George Herbert Walker said it, when Bill Clinton said it, when Nixon said, I'm not a crook.
[00:15:33.177 --> 00:15:34.619]  I'm not a crook.
[00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:36.402]  People knew he was a crook.
[00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:40.107]  So here he is saying, we all agree, that's a lie.
[00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:41.829]  Everyone here agrees, another lie.
[00:15:43.322 --> 00:15:45.502]  The science is settled, another lie.
[00:15:45.502 --> 00:15:47.463]  This is not fiction, another lie.
[00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:53.664]  It is a complete fiction according to the words of the Club of Rome in the 1960s and again in 1991.
[00:15:53.664 --> 00:16:05.926]  And we have those articles directly from the Club of Rome posted, the scans of their own publication, saying we're making this up to bring in global government.
[00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:10.767]  This is a grave and growing danger to our people.
[00:16:12.421 --> 00:16:21.146]  All of you would not be here unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:23.768]  This is not fiction.
[00:16:23.768 --> 00:16:25.449]  It is science.
[00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:27.130]  Hit pause.
[00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.331]  It is science.
[00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:34.995]  You gotta love how the three top institutions, NASA, Goddard, East Anglia University,
[00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:49.644]  And the UN itself, the three top groups, the head of the IPCC, has admitted now that he took out five scientists in the report who said man is not contributing to climate change.
[00:16:49.644 --> 00:16:54.148]  The UN's own report says maybe a degree.
[00:16:54.148 --> 00:16:56.950]  And that's a fraud.
[00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.374]  But you've got to love how they always say, well,
[00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:11.005]  What's really happening here is, sure, there were some mistakes and some lying by a few low-level scientists, but we have all these other hundreds of peer-reviewed journals.
[00:17:11.005 --> 00:17:14.829]  The peer-reviewed journals are all based on those lies, and there's hundreds of them.
[00:17:16.155 --> 00:17:33.199]  Classic examples in the last decade is there are thousands of buoys in the ocean, there are thousands of weather stations, and all the United Nations did was go cherry-pick the particular buoys and weather stations that did have increases for the year, and then only enter that data.
[00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:34.540]  There's that fraud.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:42.261]  Or they zoom in on the ice core sample record of temperature that is detailed down to 1,000th of a degree per year.
[00:17:45.703 --> 00:17:52.909]  And they go into that and they only zoom in on the last 50 years or so to show an increase we had in the last 50 years that's now declining.
[00:17:52.909 --> 00:18:08.781]  They don't show you that 50 years before that there was a spike, and 100 years before that a big spike, and 200 years before that a giant spike, tripling the spike we've seen, when people were running around in togas.
[00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:12.004]  The earth on average was 9 degrees hotter.
[00:18:14.557 --> 00:18:15.837]  Oh, and forget that!
[00:18:15.837 --> 00:18:20.299]  You want to go back to the Bronze Age, the beginning of the Bronze Age, 9,000 years ago.
[00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:33.582]  Stuff got hot, and so humans could grow more food, and weren't just, you know, on the edge of starvation, and there were more animals grazing, so there was more to hunt, and so that's where we got the beginnings of civilization.
[00:18:36.585 --> 00:18:37.085]  9,000 years ago.
[00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:41.969]  We can really thank the sun for heating up during that period.
[00:18:41.969 --> 00:18:42.810]  Thank you, sun.
[00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.173]  I mean, the ancients knew the source of life.
[00:18:46.173 --> 00:18:48.455]  That's why they worshipped the sun.
[00:18:48.455 --> 00:18:53.880]  But the UN said on Monday, the sun has no effect on climate.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.345]  That's like saying shooting yourself 15 times in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun won't kill you.
[00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:09.337]  That's like saying jumping off a 5,000 foot cliff without a parachute and falling onto spikes, razor blade spikes, won't hurt you.
[00:19:09.337 --> 00:19:13.978]  That's like saying pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting yourself on fire won't hurt.
[00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:18.480]  That's like saying the Easter Bunny is real.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.401]  I mean, it is complete mega-fraud!
[00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:24.521]  Mega-joke!
[00:19:24.521 --> 00:19:27.002]  Hey, how stupid are you out there?
[00:19:27.002 --> 00:19:27.782]  You know what?
[00:19:27.782 --> 00:19:28.163]  It's clear.
[00:19:28.163 --> 00:19:29.003]  I'm not going to get to this now.
[00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:31.875]  Let me look at my schedule here.
[00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:36.028]  We got Piers Corbin coming up in 10 minutes.
[00:19:36.028 --> 00:19:37.111]  Wayne Madsen after that.
[00:19:39.005 --> 00:19:47.812]  Before Robert Wannick comes on at 1 o'clock today, at the start of this third hour, I'm gonna play all this video and just try to give shorter comments on it.
[00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.693]  It's just, it's hard.
[00:19:49.693 --> 00:19:53.796]  Because everything he says has like a million lies, literally, behind it.
[00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:55.117]  It's just, it's a joke!
[00:19:55.117 --> 00:19:59.721]  He might as well be up there telling you the Tooth Fairy is gonna be his running mate in 2012!
[00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:03.383]  I mean, it is absolute bull!
[00:20:03.383 --> 00:20:05.105]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:08.347]  World government in all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:13.734]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:19.417]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[00:20:19.417 --> 00:20:21.878]  Patriotfood.com.
[00:20:21.878 --> 00:20:27.000]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.723]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:38.609]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:43.152]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:49.537]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:53.860]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.183]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:20:58.183 --> 00:21:00.725]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[00:21:01.892 --> 00:21:04.073]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:04.934]  Spy on me?
[00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:05.254]  Yeah.
[00:21:05.254 --> 00:21:10.297]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:10.297 --> 00:21:11.937]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:12.678]  Startpage?
[00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:13.098]  Yeah.
[00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:14.199]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:14.199 --> 00:21:17.160]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.022]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:21.022 --> 00:21:23.824]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:26.786]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.367]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:28.367 --> 00:21:28.667]  Right!
[00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:31.989]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:31.989 --> 00:21:32.549]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:33.910]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.772]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:41.555]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:41.555 --> 00:21:46.698]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:46.698 --> 00:21:49.640]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.845]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:56.156]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:56.156 --> 00:21:57.339]  That's StartPage.com
[00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:03.396]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:03.396 --> 00:22:08.940]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.481]  I get it.
[00:22:09.481 --> 00:22:19.108]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:20.269]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:28.975]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:32.377]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:32.377 --> 00:22:36.640]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.242]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:38.242 --> 00:22:41.644]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:41.644 --> 00:22:45.807]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:46.007 --> 00:22:46.908]  You should, too.
[00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:48.050]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.973]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:50.973 --> 00:22:51.033]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.033 --> 00:22:51.113]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.113 --> 00:22:51.474]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.733 --> 00:23:04.174]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:06.054]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:23:06.054 --> 00:23:07.914]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[00:23:07.914 --> 00:23:09.335]  We paid off all of our bills.
[00:23:09.335 --> 00:23:12.135]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[00:23:12.135 --> 00:23:17.777]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:23:17.777 --> 00:23:19.457]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:23:19.457 --> 00:23:22.058]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:22.518]  No More Mortgage.
[00:23:24.558 --> 00:23:25.838]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:28.339]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[00:23:28.339 --> 00:23:32.240]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.380]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.721]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[00:23:46.442 --> 00:23:48.423]  The more debt you have, the more we can help.
[00:23:48.423 --> 00:23:49.203]  Call for your free CD now.
[00:23:49.203 --> 00:23:49.283]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:49.283 --> 00:23:49.683]  This works.
[00:23:49.683 --> 00:23:50.123]  Call the number.
[00:23:54.264 --> 00:23:55.144]  Call now for your free CD.
[00:23:55.144 --> 00:23:55.204]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:55.204 --> 00:23:55.264]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:55.264 --> 00:23:55.484]  Ira Hayes.
[00:23:55.484 --> 00:23:55.785]  Ira Hayes.
[00:24:22.034 --> 00:24:29.039]  Call him drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore.
[00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:40.646]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the Marine that went to war.
[00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:44.509]  Gather round me people, there's a story I would tell.
[00:24:47.782 --> 00:24:49.503]  We need to get excited.
[00:24:49.503 --> 00:24:50.864]  We need to get angry.
[00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:52.364]  We need to get focused.
[00:24:52.364 --> 00:24:54.385]  We need to get outraged.
[00:24:54.385 --> 00:25:01.209]  A private group of banks have taken over our governments, given themselves the illegitimate criminal power.
[00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:03.150]  I don't care if they say it's legal.
[00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:07.852]  Hitler could say that murdering masses of people was legal.
[00:25:07.852 --> 00:25:10.314]  Our nation, the courts, the Congress,
[00:25:11.852 --> 00:25:17.375]  Once said it was legal to have black people as slaves pulling plows like a mule.
[00:25:17.375 --> 00:25:21.477]  But in your heart, you know that's a fraud.
[00:25:21.477 --> 00:25:30.341]  So I don't care if the bankers paid off the politicians worldwide to let them issue unlimited currency and credit to all of us.
[00:25:30.341 --> 00:25:31.821]  They own the money machines.
[00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:34.062]  They owe the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:25:34.062 --> 00:25:35.683]  They've taken over the planet.
[00:25:35.683 --> 00:25:39.125]  Now they want to cut off your resources to force you
[00:25:41.371 --> 00:25:46.535]  Into actual chattel bondage and slavery.
[00:25:46.535 --> 00:25:51.398]  That is the stated goal, the stated operation.
[00:25:51.398 --> 00:25:55.440]  And of course they can't come out and say, we want you to be chattel slaves now.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.204]  They've already bankrupted the world many times over.
[00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:02.785]  And it's been done by fraud.
[00:26:02.785 --> 00:26:05.387]  And they've already completely taken over the third world.
[00:26:05.387 --> 00:26:08.669]  And so they come back and say, oh, we want to give money to the third world.
[00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:09.510]  And then you read the treaty.
[00:26:10.248 --> 00:26:14.692]  It's 30% compounded interest loans.
[00:26:14.692 --> 00:26:29.544]  So they tax the West, send money to the third world with 30% or higher compounded interest and say, we won't loan you this money unless you sterilize your people and shut down factories.
[00:26:29.544 --> 00:26:34.048]  The corrupt dictators and thugs that run the third world cesspits
[00:26:36.104 --> 00:26:38.645]  That we're fast becoming because of corruption.
[00:26:38.645 --> 00:26:41.066]  That's why they can't get up off their feet.
[00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:44.828]  Can't get up off their butts because they're literally under corruption.
[00:26:44.828 --> 00:26:50.211]  These countries use corruption as a way to keep control of people.
[00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:51.992]  They work to keep them poor.
[00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:55.553]  This has been the stated control system of empires for 5,000 years.
[00:26:58.493 --> 00:27:03.695]  There were books written by the Babylonians, books written by the Romans.
[00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:06.416]  I have read them on how to control people.
[00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:09.398]  And you don't think the governments know how to do that today?
[00:27:09.398 --> 00:27:17.541]  Oh, we have their current documents, where they say they want to wreck the industrial society to make you dependent on them.
[00:27:17.541 --> 00:27:19.642]  The government doesn't want your tax money.
[00:27:19.642 --> 00:27:21.683]  They want to own you.
[00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:22.564]  Period.
[00:27:22.564 --> 00:27:25.625]  They are parasites.
[00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:27.846]  And right now, this is being established.
[00:27:28.797 --> 00:27:33.580]  Right now, it's being set up.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.421]  World government is being born.
[00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:38.563]  Everybody's asking me, well Alex, is it gonna pass?
[00:27:38.563 --> 00:27:41.104]  And the answer is yes.
[00:27:41.104 --> 00:27:42.825]  Yes.
[00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:57.214]  They've already got an accepted draft, and they keep adding to it, but what's currently been accepted, what's currently been signed off on, according to the UN itself and the London Guardian, and Paul Watson has reports on this right now, at InfoWars.com,
[00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:14.664]  What's been signed off on right now establishes a planetary government that levies taxes over nations on all financial transfers and travel.
[00:28:14.664 --> 00:28:19.286]  And they're adding more all day long into the night.
[00:28:19.286 --> 00:28:20.867]  They're seven hours ahead of
[00:28:21.957 --> 00:28:30.103]  Central time, six hours ahead of Eastern time, and they're saying they're going to work through the night on this agreement, and they want to leave it vague.
[00:28:30.103 --> 00:28:38.068]  You just... They put out a vague agreement, the country signed on to it, and the UN can do whatever they want.
[00:28:38.068 --> 00:28:42.391]  Now that's what's going on right now.
[00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:49.936]  Key article by Paul Joseph Watson, final Copenhagen text includes global transaction tax and more.
[00:28:53.430 --> 00:29:02.055]  Another headline, is the European police state going global by Viscount Monckton of Brentley?
[00:29:02.055 --> 00:29:04.737]  See, now we're finally talking about real issues.
[00:29:04.737 --> 00:29:11.561]  Global police states, global one-child policies, global armies, global taxes.
[00:29:11.561 --> 00:29:13.422]  It's all out in the open.
[00:29:13.422 --> 00:29:21.147]  They stalled you as long as they could as they were moving their armies up, moving their tanks up, moving their artillery up, telling you, oh, we're not going to attack you.
[00:29:22.014 --> 00:29:23.434]  It's the equivalent of that.
[00:29:23.434 --> 00:29:37.098]  And now they open fire with their full barrage, thousands of artillery pieces, tanks rolling across, shock troops machine gunning us in our box holes, full globalist assault overrunning us right now.
[00:29:37.098 --> 00:29:46.600]  But thank God, a lot of us went out and warned everybody about this, and so a lot of our people were ready, and we are repulsing a lot of these attacks.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.941]  But we're fighting for our lives, fighting for freedom right now!
[00:29:52.498 --> 00:29:56.424]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.424 --> 00:29:59.108]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.513 --> 00:30:06.056]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:06.056 --> 00:30:06.977]  Number one.
[00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:10.400]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.260]  Number two.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:16.144]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:16.144 --> 00:30:16.885]  It's true.
[00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:21.768]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.768 --> 00:30:22.229]  Number three.
[00:30:22.569 --> 00:30:26.172]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:26.172 --> 00:30:30.876]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:30.876 --> 00:30:33.638]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:33.638 --> 00:30:38.102]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:42.266]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:42.266 --> 00:30:47.030]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:51.477]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.477 --> 00:30:53.260]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.524]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:55.524 --> 00:30:57.868]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:04.927]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:10.250]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.310]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:17.313]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:18.493]  How much do you want?
[00:31:18.493 --> 00:31:19.614]  When do you want it?
[00:31:19.614 --> 00:31:21.494]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:21.494 --> 00:31:22.575]  When will you need it?
[00:31:22.575 --> 00:31:24.776]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:26.116]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:26.116 --> 00:31:27.417]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:27.637 --> 00:31:32.902]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:32.902 --> 00:31:36.486]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:36.486 --> 00:31:40.310]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.531]  How much will you need?
[00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:42.432]  We don't know.
[00:31:42.432 --> 00:31:43.533]  How much do you want?
[00:31:43.533 --> 00:31:44.474]  All you can get.
[00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:45.275]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:48.599]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:50.841]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:50.841 --> 00:31:51.822]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:00.908 --> 00:32:06.215]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:10.741]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:10.741 --> 00:32:13.024]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:13.024 --> 00:32:14.646]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:15.668]  There is a solution.
[00:32:15.908 --> 00:32:24.336]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:32:24.336 --> 00:32:31.803]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:20.659]  The devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal.
[00:33:20.659 --> 00:33:24.341]  He was in a bind, cause he was way behind and he was willing to make a deal.
[00:33:24.341 --> 00:33:27.863]  When he came across this young man sewing on a fiddle and playing it hot.
[00:33:27.863 --> 00:33:31.464]  And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said, boy, let me tell you what.
[00:33:31.464 --> 00:33:35.066]  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too.
[00:33:35.066 --> 00:33:38.467]  And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.
[00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:41.889]  Now you play pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due.
[00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:44.870]  I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul, cause I think I'm better than you.
[00:33:45.570 --> 00:34:05.885]  The boy said, my name's Johnny and it might be a sin But I'll take your bet you're gonna regret, cause I'm the best there's ever been Johnny Ross, dump your bow and play your fiddle hard Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose, the devil gets your soul
[00:34:08.581 --> 00:34:10.923]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:11.744]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:11.744 --> 00:34:14.527]  Central Standard Time, that's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:34:14.527 --> 00:34:16.189]  Eastern, we are here live.
[00:34:16.189 --> 00:34:20.233]  I want to thank all of our great AM and FM affiliates, getting a lot of new affiliates.
[00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:29.522]  I want to thank the Shortwave affiliate as well, WWCR, number one internet radio show as well at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:29.522 --> 00:34:31.063]  A lot of people say they have the number one
[00:34:31.784 --> 00:34:37.066]  Internet radio show, but we really do, according to Shoutcast and all the other gauges, just go look.
[00:34:37.066 --> 00:34:40.928]  I see these shows that have like 10 listeners saying they're number one.
[00:34:40.928 --> 00:34:46.170]  We're number one with over 400,000 internet radio listeners a day.
[00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.972]  Side issue, I hardly ever talk about that.
[00:34:48.972 --> 00:34:53.354]  I just thought I would throw that factoid out there at you.
[00:34:53.354 --> 00:35:00.757]  And over 200,000 people a day tuning in to the free podcast, subscribing to that at InfoWars.com on the listen page as well.
[00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:09.585]  Okay, for the balance of this hour, I thought we'd get into the latest on Climategate, the fraud, a long list of frauds.
[00:35:10.789 --> 00:35:11.930]  Santer at the U.N.
[00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.972]  and others, admittingly now coming out and saying that they altered U.N.
[00:35:15.972 --> 00:35:16.692]  reports.
[00:35:16.692 --> 00:35:18.233]  That's on top of ClimateGate.
[00:35:18.233 --> 00:35:21.635]  That just broke Wednesday on Jesse Ventura's new TV show.
[00:35:21.635 --> 00:35:24.336]  Santer admitted it in an interview.
[00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:28.218]  We also are going to be talking about the science behind it.
[00:35:28.218 --> 00:35:35.282]  And we're also going to be talking about the latest in Copenhagen as open world government is being announced and it looks like established.
[00:35:36.045 --> 00:35:37.507]  We've got to fight this fraud.
[00:35:37.507 --> 00:35:45.816]  Pierce Corbin is a leading... I set out to find someone who is known as a leading meteorologist, astrophysicist.
[00:35:45.816 --> 00:35:49.240]  I mean, the degrees go on and on.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:55.647]  And from all the experts I've talked to and looked at, he's one of the top forecasters who has accurately
[00:35:56.408 --> 00:35:56.849]  I don't know.
[00:36:10.976 --> 00:36:27.184]  Mr. Corbin, the British press calls you Dr. Corbin, but it all gets confusing with all these different scientific areas you're an expert in, but in a nutshell, tell us your main area of study about weather action and then the fraud of man-made climate change.
[00:36:27.184 --> 00:36:35.308]  Yes, well I got a first-class degree from Imperial College in physics and then went on and did astrophysics at Queen Mary College in London.
[00:36:38.555 --> 00:36:44.778]  I developed from that into studying the Sun and how the Sun affects the Earth's weather.
[00:36:44.778 --> 00:37:04.089]  And after some years of studying all sorts of ideas, we developed this method for long-range weather forecasting called the Solar Weather Technique, which depends on the magnetic particles coming from the Sun and how they change circulation patterns on Earth.
[00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:12.016]  Subject to certain modulations, such as what the Moon is doing as well.
[00:37:12.016 --> 00:37:29.509]  And it... I mean, from studying most of the scientists we talked to, more and more say the evidence is showing that the Sun is one of the main drivers, but the UN, again on Monday, just declared, as if they were the Pope, saying the Earth is the center of the universe and flat.
[00:37:29.509 --> 00:37:32.312]  They announced that the Sun has nothing to do with it!
[00:37:32.312 --> 00:37:33.873]  Yes, well, they would, wouldn't they?
[00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:36.190]  Because they have another agenda.
[00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:43.392]  Now, we know that what they say is failed science based on fraudulent data.
[00:37:43.392 --> 00:37:57.656]  And we know from our own measurements and actual experience that the sun is the prime driver of all weather change on the Earth.
[00:37:57.656 --> 00:38:02.198]  And carbon dioxide has nothing, absolutely nothing, zero, zero,
[00:38:03.033 --> 00:38:04.114]  Uh, influence.
[00:38:04.114 --> 00:38:08.595]  For whatever reason, to do with feedbacks or whatever, but it has no influence.
[00:38:08.595 --> 00:38:13.557]  And am I right, Doctor, in saying it is one of the lowest-traced gases in the atmosphere?
[00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:14.477]  That's right, yes.
[00:38:14.477 --> 00:38:21.280]  There's only, uh, one part in 3,000, uh, is carbon dioxide.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:31.544]  Now, of course, they argue all sorts of critical processes, but we say, well, show us the evidence, actual observational evidence that carbon dioxide drives temperatures and
[00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:33.956]  Extreme events and there is none.
[00:38:33.956 --> 00:38:44.545]  And I was on Russian TV a few days ago pointing at somebody from the United Nations Climate Committee, the IPCC, and said, all right, if you have the evidence, email it to me.
[00:38:44.545 --> 00:38:49.269]  And I gave him my email address, peers at weatheraction.com, on the air.
[00:38:49.269 --> 00:38:50.750]  And so far, he's emailed nothing.
[00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.832]  And of course, he won't because there is no evidence.
[00:38:53.851 --> 00:38:56.311]  Well, most of these guys know it's fraud.
[00:38:56.311 --> 00:39:06.653]  I've talked to a lot of them at events, on the street, at smart growth conferences, and they just, off camera, laugh and say, and say, buddy, we're getting rich.
[00:39:06.653 --> 00:39:08.834]  I mean, this is just a band of criminals.
[00:39:08.834 --> 00:39:10.834]  It is cynical, yeah.
[00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:23.136]  I mean, I know some of them, you know, friends of mine in some sense, or they were friends of mine, saying, well, you know, quite openly, you may well be right, and they might even say you are right, but I've got mouths to feed.
[00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:28.804]  And, you know, they'll go on this gravy train for as long as it's there.
[00:39:28.804 --> 00:39:31.205]  Which is scandalous, of course.
[00:39:31.205 --> 00:39:31.765]  Scandalous.
[00:39:31.765 --> 00:39:40.250]  I mean, we believe in whether action or science and policy making has to be evidence-based.
[00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.193]  And this is not evidence-based, it's based on fraud.
[00:39:44.193 --> 00:39:49.556]  As you mentioned, there's been a whole lot of revelations coming out of the fraud.
[00:39:49.556 --> 00:39:52.878]  Not just that the University of East Anglia have been meddling with
[00:39:53.362 --> 00:39:59.547]  Data to make their bizarre little models fit history and rub out the medieval warm period.
[00:39:59.547 --> 00:40:18.123]  But we now know, for example, in New Zealand, data was chosen so that although the real data showed a falling of temperatures of 0.7 degrees centigrade per century, they fiddled it to turn it into a rising of 1.2 degrees per century.
[00:40:18.123 --> 00:40:20.265]  And we now know that in Russia, they
[00:40:21.226 --> 00:40:21.406]  I think?
[00:40:45.664 --> 00:40:51.322]  As Obama landed and we, in fact, at Weather Action had forecasted just these blizzards.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.783]  Uh, from, uh, in detail from 30 days ahead.
[00:40:54.783 --> 00:40:57.686]  Although the general idea is we often forecast from longer ahead.
[00:40:57.686 --> 00:41:15.222]  Now, one of their favorite tricks is you have hundreds of thousands of different sub-weather systems, according to what I've read, correct me if I'm wrong, and they will just pick one little area that's having extreme weather, but you're always, out of thousands of different areas, going to be able to find a few areas that are having extreme weather.
[00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:15.963]  That is normal.
[00:41:16.463 --> 00:41:17.744]  Absolutely, yes.
[00:41:17.744 --> 00:41:25.851]  You see, because, you know, every town and city has got a maximum, a minimum, a wet, you know, an amount of rainfall, amount of sunshine and so on.
[00:41:25.851 --> 00:41:32.237]  So you go around the world, in any year or month, you can find somebody who's got an extreme and you can announce it.
[00:41:32.237 --> 00:41:34.859]  Which, of course, isn't just nonsense.
[00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:42.306]  Whereas weather action, from a long time ahead, we can announce periods, very short periods, around the world where there will be
[00:41:42.941 --> 00:41:52.687]  I see a whole lot of simultaneous, more or less simultaneous, weather extreme events, which happened, for example, from the 17th to 19th of November this year.
[00:41:52.687 --> 00:42:03.032]  There were enormous storms and deluges, I don't know, in the USA, in Africa, India, Australia and Europe.
[00:42:03.032 --> 00:42:04.933]  And we predicted those a long time ahead.
[00:42:04.933 --> 00:42:09.436]  So, you know, there are real extremes going on, and those type of things they cannot predict.
[00:42:10.037 --> 00:42:14.300]  All they can do later after funding is say, oh there's an extreme, that must be CO2.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:24.126]  Well, shifting gears with appears Corbyn, shifting gears sir, why have you been so accurate with long-term forecasting at weatheraction.com?
[00:42:24.126 --> 00:42:37.474]  Well, the reason why we're accurate is because we understand the essential nature of the magnetic and particle relationship which drives the Earth's weather and climate.
[00:42:39.907 --> 00:42:48.429]  Obviously, it's vastly complicated, so we don't have supercomputers to do it, or models, which, just like financial models, would go wrong.
[00:42:48.429 --> 00:43:06.512]  What we're able to do is, understanding the periods of the forcing factors and the changing forcing factors, is we can identify when in the past there were very similar Sun-Earth magnetic forcing factors affecting the world, as there will be at some time in the future.
[00:43:07.205 --> 00:43:10.867]  So by knowing the past, you know the future, understanding the science.
[00:43:10.867 --> 00:43:11.767]  Exactly.
[00:43:11.767 --> 00:43:15.249]  The point we make is there's nothing new happening.
[00:43:15.249 --> 00:43:18.270]  All the weather you see now has happened before sometime.
[00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:24.153]  Just to identify when in the past is going to be very similar to sometime in the future.
[00:43:24.153 --> 00:43:31.436]  It might be 40 years ago, it might be 100 years ago, but we have ways which are quite mathematically clever of finding
[00:43:31.934 --> 00:43:35.315]  Have you read about John?
[00:43:35.315 --> 00:43:41.417]  Have you read about John P Holdren, the White House Science-R, who's also involved in the Climategate emails?
[00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:45.899]  He says they're going to save us, and they're always saving us from something new.
[00:43:45.899 --> 00:43:49.480]  He says with geoengineering or terraforming,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.461]  He says they're doing tests to manipulate the weather.
[00:43:53.461 --> 00:43:57.163]  The Russians, the Chinese, they all claim they can control the weather.
[00:43:57.163 --> 00:44:09.708]  In your modeling, I know you're looking at the entire planet, the sun, the particles, the nuclei coming in from space, but do you ever see anything weird going on because of some of the weather modification testing?
[00:44:09.708 --> 00:44:12.349]  Well, it's very difficult to know.
[00:44:16.883 --> 00:44:26.128]  If they could really control the weather, I don't think they'd allow a blizzard to happen when Obama landed in Copenhagen, so it certainly couldn't be that good.
[00:44:26.128 --> 00:44:35.813]  But I do, I'm aware of these things that they are doing experiments with, and I know some things do work to an extent.
[00:44:35.813 --> 00:44:42.776]  Now, there's a curious little story about what happened in China recently, because in this period, the 17th to 19th of November,
[00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:50.062]  Which we had predicted would be a lot of extreme weather.
[00:44:50.062 --> 00:45:02.408]  In China there was, well the Chinese reported 3 million people had to be moved out of their homes because of absolutely massive snowstorms.
[00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:13.375]  And there was also a story around that although there may have been natural processes going on that they were also cloud seeding at the same time or just before and it had made things worse.
[00:45:14.639 --> 00:45:25.751]  The problem is, of course, we've got no way of verifying this, because the Chinese government aren't going to say that they did this, which resulted in 32 people dying when some buildings collapsed.
[00:45:25.751 --> 00:45:31.798]  But we do know as well, there were very real events around the world, which we predicted a long time ahead.
[00:45:31.798 --> 00:45:36.283]  And they're based on looking back in the past, so there's no way they could have
[00:45:39.172 --> 00:45:57.667]  Well, I tend to agree with you because I've talked to Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons and others, and he said they can, with the right conditions, they could make a hurricane, they could strengthen one or weaken one, but he said that when the giant weather system is coming in, that it's so huge that it's hard to control.
[00:45:57.667 --> 00:46:05.073]  But he says in smaller areas, they can manipulate things, and I would know, well, the Russians... They've got to have a situation where
[00:46:05.513 --> 00:46:09.876]  Already, to like, be triggered.
[00:46:09.876 --> 00:46:11.297]  I would have thought, yes.
[00:46:11.297 --> 00:46:12.898]  Oh sure, I'm no doubt that they are.
[00:46:12.898 --> 00:46:14.158]  I'm sure it can't be done.
[00:46:28.214 --> 00:46:32.377]  Well, I'd say never will be done, but you have to be careful about never these days.
[00:46:32.377 --> 00:46:34.138]  You just don't know what's possible.
[00:46:34.138 --> 00:46:42.323]  But, you know, the Sun-Earth Lunar System is vastly more powerful than anything man can mobilize.
[00:46:42.323 --> 00:46:49.207]  But of course, if man can play at the critical edges when something is tipping one way or the other, then there are possibilities.
[00:46:49.207 --> 00:46:54.310]  But they only work at those times, and those times occur due to natural processes.
[00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.232]  So any control is only limited to certain
[00:46:57.853 --> 00:47:00.034]  So what is going on with the sun right now?
[00:47:00.034 --> 00:47:01.174]  Why have we been cooling for nine years?
[00:47:01.174 --> 00:47:05.516]  We've been cooling for nine years essentially because of the decline in solar activity and it being an odd sunspot cycle.
[00:47:05.516 --> 00:47:06.036]  We're just leaving.
[00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:33.972]  When that happens in an odd time spot cycle you will get less warming.
[00:47:33.972 --> 00:47:48.361]  We're also in the situation where the effect of the moon is to limit the effect of particles which would cause warming.
[00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:53.964]  When you get into an even cycle things change and in fact even cycles are generally colder
[00:47:54.648 --> 00:47:57.449]  Sir, what would... I mean, as a leading astrophysicist...
[00:48:07.355 --> 00:48:07.695]  Sure.
[00:48:07.695 --> 00:48:28.873]  I mean, as a leading astrophysicist and someone who studies the entire Earth-Sun-Moon relationship, what type of cycle or what area of the cycle were we in 9,000 years ago when the warming was, according to the graphs I've seen, much hotter than it's been in the last century?
[00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:29.554]  Right.
[00:48:29.554 --> 00:48:33.998]  Well, to be specific, we'd have to look carefully, but the
[00:48:34.554 --> 00:48:44.481]  The world temperature will depend on the solar activity and how well that activity actually reaches Earth, which is about magnetic connectivity.
[00:48:44.481 --> 00:48:57.630]  And that is going to be affected not just by the 22-year magnetic cycle of the Sun, but also by the close orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the Sun's magnetic axis.
[00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.731]  So there's that question.
[00:48:59.731 --> 00:49:01.993]  There's a question of the solar-lunar things.
[00:49:02.515 --> 00:49:16.042]  And then there's the question of the slow cycles of general solar activity, which they're not just operating on the scale of 11 years or so, but on hundreds of years, if not many hundreds of years.
[00:49:16.042 --> 00:49:25.167]  So it's going to be all those combinations of the solar activity, lunar modulations and orientation.
[00:49:25.167 --> 00:49:31.930]  So I couldn't be specific exactly to say, but we should in principle be able to predict
[00:49:32.586 --> 00:49:37.170]  When in the future, similar things will happen again.
[00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:42.795]  When will we have something close to what happened during the beginning of the Bronze Age?
[00:49:42.795 --> 00:49:43.576]  I mean, the heating up?
[00:49:43.576 --> 00:49:50.802]  Well, maybe never, because you see, sometime there's got to be a return to an Ice Age.
[00:49:50.802 --> 00:49:58.489]  The natural state of the world for the last few million years is Ice Ages, with intermittent warm periods lasting
[00:49:58.959 --> 00:50:04.423]  You know, typically 10,000 years, which we're in now, and we are, you know, in year 10,000 now.
[00:50:04.423 --> 00:50:08.686]  So, logically, there is Ice Age due.
[00:50:08.686 --> 00:50:24.097]  Now, it might have been that was almost an Ice Age coming at about 0 AD, because, you know, since then, or 1,000 AD, since then it has been notably colder, but we don't know.
[00:50:24.097 --> 00:50:28.180]  What we can say about the next 100 years is, according to our
[00:50:29.608 --> 00:50:40.851]  Our theory, and I don't like using the word model because we, you know, it is, we base it on observations and equations rather than playing games with computers, although we do use computers of course.
[00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:46.753]  Our theory shows that we're in for a continuing general cooling.
[00:50:46.753 --> 00:50:48.293]  There will be fluctuations in it.
[00:50:54.588 --> 00:50:55.209]  Amazing!
[00:50:55.209 --> 00:50:57.489]  Let's get into their fraud when we come back.
[00:50:57.489 --> 00:50:58.790]  We've got a break, sir.
[00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.211]  Pierce Corbin as our guest.
[00:51:00.211 --> 00:51:01.091]  Amazing information.
[00:51:02.304 --> 00:51:05.666]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:51:05.666 --> 00:51:09.567]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:51:09.567 --> 00:51:13.309]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:21.493]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[00:51:21.493 --> 00:51:21.853]  I think so.
[00:51:46.429 --> 00:51:48.430]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.491]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:50.491 --> 00:51:52.152]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:12.788 --> 00:52:15.391]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:15.391 --> 00:52:21.757]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.757 --> 00:52:26.962]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.962 --> 00:52:36.931]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:37.051 --> 00:52:39.393]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:39.393 --> 00:52:40.995]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.995 --> 00:52:43.457]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:43.457 --> 00:52:45.559]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:50.724]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:50.724 --> 00:53:02.094]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:02.094 --> 00:53:02.875]  Studies have shown that
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.080]  I think so.
[00:53:33.114 --> 00:53:33.434]  We're good.
[00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:17.493]  He's agreed to stay with us about 20 minutes into the next hour because I want to talk more about what an ice age would look like.
[00:54:17.493 --> 00:54:24.096]  Just 200 miles north of me is where in the last ice age the main glacier ended in southern Oklahoma.
[00:54:24.096 --> 00:54:31.619]  Up in Oklahoma you just see giant boulders out in the middle of flat fields brought there by several hundred foot thick glaciers.
[00:54:32.419 --> 00:54:39.043]  And all the evidence, all the real science, what governments really believe is we're going into an ice age.
[00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:46.208]  They fraudulently chose warming because they believe that would scare the public better and people wouldn't believe an ice age was coming.
[00:54:46.208 --> 00:54:47.428]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:54:47.428 --> 00:54:49.429]  It's a sick, cynical joke.
[00:54:49.429 --> 00:54:51.671]  So our guest is coming up with us more in the next hour.
[00:54:51.671 --> 00:54:58.855]  We'll talk about the scientific fraud, Climategate, some of the other frauds that haven't been as well publicized.
[00:54:58.855 --> 00:54:59.696]  Before I do that,
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:05.283]  UPS can still ship to most areas of the country by Wednesday.
[00:55:05.283 --> 00:55:12.066]  It's not guaranteed, but if you order today, we've got folks in here shipping tomorrow, most areas will still get it in time for Christmas.
[00:55:12.066 --> 00:55:27.435]  You can get my new film, Fall of the Republic, covering the global government, UN takeover of the planet, through the fake climate change fraud, through all their fear-mongering, the population control, the eugenics, John P. Holdren, Al Gore, Jay Rockefeller, this is my greatest film.
[00:55:28.556 --> 00:55:32.119]  And you can get a free Obama t-shirt, anti-Obama t-shirt.
[00:55:32.119 --> 00:55:39.644]  You can get a free Don't Tread on Me t-shirt for a limited time at Infowars.com when you order Fall of the Republic.
[00:55:39.644 --> 00:55:44.867]  We have other deals where you can get Obama deception free with Fall of the Republic or in-game.
[00:55:44.867 --> 00:55:46.629]  I just want to get this out to folks.
[00:55:46.629 --> 00:55:49.451]  And so it's a great gift or give it as a gift for yourself and
[00:55:50.231 --> 00:55:57.217]  It's not too late, up until Christmas Eve, to give friends and family PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[00:55:57.217 --> 00:55:59.318]  All my films in super high quality.
[00:55:59.318 --> 00:56:01.220]  My book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:05.263]  My live radio show that we simulcast on TV for the last two hours every day.
[00:56:06.344 --> 00:56:10.585]  Six years, coming up on six years of archives, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:10.585 --> 00:56:16.627]  You get five and a half months free when you sign up in the month of December, so take advantage of that or give it as a gift.
[00:56:16.627 --> 00:56:26.011]  You can share the passcode with six people, so you can give yourself a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and give a few friends and family the username and passcode as an e-card.
[00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:27.251]  Okay, this is a short segment.
[00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.192]  Going back to our guest, finishing up with one of the leading
[00:56:30.512 --> 00:56:32.052]  He said a lot of things, I think.
[00:56:58.659 --> 00:57:00.981]  I understand the ice age is 100, 200, 400, 500.
[00:57:00.981 --> 00:57:03.443]  We just know we're due for another one.
[00:57:03.443 --> 00:57:05.465]  We're going into a cooling trend now.
[00:57:05.465 --> 00:57:08.167]  What would an ice age look like?
[00:57:08.167 --> 00:57:25.622]  Well, they take about a couple of thousand years to develop fully, but what happens is the ice caps in both hemispheres would increase in size and it just gets progressively colder and the sea freezes over in the polar regions.
[00:57:26.528 --> 00:57:31.190]  It all just makes the, you know, moves towards the equator.
[00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:40.174]  So typically across the United States of America, you'd have an ice front, you know, and an ice cap would extend there.
[00:57:40.174 --> 00:57:45.596]  And in the case of the last ice age in Britain, it went through the middle of Britain.
[00:57:45.596 --> 00:57:54.160]  So the south of England was actually ice, not ice, and Scotland and the whole of Northern England and most of Ireland was covered in ice.
[00:57:55.063 --> 00:57:55.383]  I don't know.
[00:58:11.306 --> 00:58:18.053]  Or else they'd find ways of overcoming this by building things on the ice, which is an interesting idea.
[00:58:18.053 --> 00:58:19.815]  Was there a more ancient ice age?
[00:58:19.815 --> 00:58:24.680]  I mean, because I know that the ice came all the way down to Texas.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.541]  Oh yeah, there were other ice ages.
[00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:28.563]  It just came down further than the last one.
[00:58:28.563 --> 00:58:29.344]  That is correct.
[00:58:30.778 --> 00:58:37.442]  Um, they've been different sizes and they happen typically every 100,000 years or 90,000 years or 120,000 years.
[00:58:37.442 --> 00:58:40.044]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:40.044 --> 00:58:42.325]  Back in one minute.
[00:58:42.325 --> 00:58:47.068]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:51.711 --> 00:58:58.692]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:58:58.692 --> 00:58:59.973]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:58:59.973 --> 00:59:00.773]  It's very real.
[00:59:00.773 --> 00:59:04.674]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:09.155]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:59:09.155 --> 00:59:11.716]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:59:54.878 --> 00:59:57.260]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.043]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:13.098]  Well, for the next 20 minutes or so, we have a preeminent astrophysicist, meteorologist, Piers Corbin,
[01:00:39.977 --> 01:00:45.599]  WeatherAction.com and we appreciate him joining us.
[01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:53.622]  Okay, in the two segments we've got left, the short one and the longer one coming up, specifically the fraud of these scientists.
[01:00:53.622 --> 01:01:07.527]  I mean, you see them, you're in England, you're around them, but this has exposed fraud throughout the United Nations system where they went out and recruited, and those documents are now public for those that don't know, and created a premeditated fraud.
[01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:16.596]  Well, as a scientist, I find it utterly reprehensible, and I'm astounded by the depth of it.
[01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:31.925]  You know, just choosing data sets in New Zealand and Russia, just meddling with parameters to adjust actual measured data or losing actual measured data when they produce their so-called world forecast.
[01:01:31.925 --> 01:01:36.668]  I mean, as far as we're concerned, not world forecast, world data set, as far as we're concerned,
[01:01:37.717 --> 01:01:46.682]  A data set produced for the world by the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia is rubbish and we're never going to use it again.
[01:01:46.682 --> 01:02:00.790]  We're instead going to try and use satellite data and work with other scientists around the world in order to try and develop an accurate data set of what happened in the past, which would improve our long-range forecast of climate.
[01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:05.233]  And if anything, of course, it would make our projections of cooling into even more cooling.
[01:02:07.133 --> 01:02:09.436]  What should be done with the scientists?
[01:02:09.436 --> 01:02:14.001]  I think all those involved in this fraudulent activity should be sacked.
[01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:21.530]  And we have to demand that governments do accountable and evidence-based science and policy making.
[01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:24.658]  By accountable, their data needs to be public.
[01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:31.121]  I mean, that was the big red flag from the East Anglia facility, is that they wouldn't ever let anybody see their raw data.
[01:02:31.121 --> 01:02:32.242]  Now they've destroyed the data.
[01:02:32.242 --> 01:02:34.022]  They say they're going to give us cook.
[01:02:34.022 --> 01:02:35.823]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:35.823 --> 01:02:45.628]  Some of the data was available, but they had these computer codes, which they used to allow for various things, as they put it, to make it more
[01:02:46.374 --> 01:02:46.854]  Accurate.
[01:02:46.854 --> 01:02:54.296]  Well, actually, of course, they were doing the opposite, which is why they didn't want to show what they were up to.
[01:02:54.296 --> 01:02:57.577]  And we should take our hats off to the guys who released it.
[01:02:57.577 --> 01:03:14.482]  However, I think it's quite likely it was actually an inside job, and they were releasing the data in the manner they had in order to try and say that it isn't accurate and can't be trusted, because if they had have released it under the Freedom of Information Act, then we would have been able to quiz these guys directly.
[01:03:15.074 --> 01:03:19.798]  Instead, one of them has stepped down for the time being, so he can't be asked anything.
[01:03:19.798 --> 01:03:32.209]  So I'm very suspicious of the whole thing, but, you know, it is now clear that it is failed science based on fraudulent data, and this fraud has been activated around the whole world.
[01:03:32.995 --> 01:03:41.065]  Well, the world's climate system, as you know, but for the audience who may not, is so incredibly complex that not even supercomputers can even begin to grasp.
[01:03:41.065 --> 01:03:46.491]  But that's why you can only look at past systems just to understand trends to forecast.
[01:03:46.491 --> 01:03:48.734]  Because, I mean, here's the Christian Science Monitor.
[01:03:48.734 --> 01:03:52.798]  Philippines force evacuation as volcano eruption threatens
[01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:57.582]  Yes, well of course they've got a few problems there, haven't they?
[01:03:57.582 --> 01:03:59.083]  The dust indeed does make a
[01:04:18.809 --> 01:04:18.949]  Yeah.
[01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:55.333]  We got huge volcanoes, a giant sun radiating us, all these other cosmic rays coming in forming nuclei that form clouds.
[01:04:55.333 --> 01:05:01.716]  Meanwhile, some tiny trace gas that's precious to plants is being listed as a chemical weapon!
[01:05:01.716 --> 01:05:06.278]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:10.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.983]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:16.343 --> 01:05:17.083]  It's true.
[01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:22.785]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:26.367]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:26.367 --> 01:05:31.088]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:31.088 --> 01:05:33.849]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:37.171]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:38.311 --> 01:05:42.454]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:42.454 --> 01:05:47.517]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:47.517 --> 01:05:51.679]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:53.460]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:58.063]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:03.356 --> 01:06:07.317]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:07.317 --> 01:06:16.180]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:20.801]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:31.625]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:32.265 --> 01:06:41.774]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:41.774 --> 01:06:47.219]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:47.219 --> 01:06:54.705]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:54.705 --> 01:06:57.448]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:06.572]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:06.572 --> 01:07:09.814]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.814 --> 01:07:14.617]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:14.617 --> 01:07:21.001]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:21.001 --> 01:07:23.243]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:23.743 --> 01:07:25.404]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:07:25.404 --> 01:07:26.545]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:26.545 --> 01:07:28.787]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:44.821]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:49.966]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.966 --> 01:07:59.075]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:03.576 --> 01:08:10.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.062]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.062 --> 01:08:30.512]  Piers Corbin is a world-renowned British weather forecaster and consultant, and owner of the business Weather Action, which makes weather forecasts up to a year in advance, and has one of the most accurate track records out there.
[01:08:31.297 --> 01:08:33.958]  WeatherAction.com.
[01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:37.139]  And he's not just breaking down ClimateGate or Copenhagen.
[01:08:37.139 --> 01:08:45.501]  Before he leaves us at the end of this segment, he's going to give us his forecast in the next few months for extreme weather around the world and into the next year.
[01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:53.703]  And you can write it down and check on it later or go to his site and subscribe to get more detailed weather forecast in your area.
[01:08:53.703 --> 01:08:56.644]  Long-term weather forecasting from WeatherAction.com.
[01:08:58.624 --> 01:09:03.587]  And of course he did predict more than a decade ago the cooling trend and that's now begun.
[01:09:03.587 --> 01:09:10.210]  But going back to Pierce Corbin, astrophysicist, meteorologist, the list goes on and on.
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:16.153]  Sir, the mindset of these people, you've been persecuted by them, demonized, anyone else that...
[01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:18.854]  Dr. Tim Ball got death threats.
[01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:23.537]  I could barely get him to be interviewed for my film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:09:23.537 --> 01:09:24.758]  People get persecuted.
[01:09:24.758 --> 01:09:29.420]  People are... I mean, these are very dangerous folks.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.281]  Why are they doing it?
[01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:38.806]  Well, their motive... You see, if they're telling lies, there must be a reason, because we know the climate thing is a fraud.
[01:09:38.806 --> 01:09:44.729]  Well, what we think they want to do, and it is pretty clear, is they want to create another bubble of false value.
[01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:51.014]  Using carbon trading, which is now worth hundreds of billions of pounds a year.
[01:09:51.014 --> 01:10:06.160]  And through this, they hope to control the world economy, hold back development of underdeveloped countries, and keep food prices high by burning food and biofuels... Which is a death sentence!
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.801]  Which is a death sentence!
[01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:09.642]  Well of course it is!
[01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:13.824]  The result of their policies is causing starvation and food riots.
[01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:16.899]  In a number of countries.
[01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:22.862]  And it's also causing, they claim, they're trying to build jobs in a low-carbon economy.
[01:10:22.862 --> 01:10:37.187]  But in Britain, we've got an example where a steelworks in Northern England, in a place called Redcar, is closing because Tata Steel, who own it, are getting a handout for reducing carbon emissions in England.
[01:10:37.187 --> 01:10:43.190]  And at the same time, they're getting another handout for building so-called clean steelworks in India.
[01:10:43.755 --> 01:10:52.958]  So they're taking two billion quid, two billion dollars, and making 1,700 workers in Britain redundant.
[01:10:52.958 --> 01:11:05.122]  And lo and behold, the interesting to note is that the director of the Tata Steel Energy Research Institute is Dr. Pachirai, who is also chair of the United Nations.
[01:11:05.698 --> 01:11:12.007]  And for those that don't recognize the name, he's the guy that looks like Osama Bin Laden.
[01:11:19.548 --> 01:11:36.889]  So expanding on this, to put this in layman's terms, a group of crooks are in there using taxpayer money to move what's left of Western industry to third world areas where they control the population and have slave wages.
[01:11:36.889 --> 01:11:38.150]  It's all cold-blooded.
[01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:38.491]  It's like
[01:11:39.351 --> 01:11:52.298]  It's like Al Gore's Oxygenal Petroleum that he controls being one of the worst violators of the rainforest and things that actually can be registered as some type of environmental loss, even though it can be regenerated.
[01:11:52.298 --> 01:11:58.561]  The point is that I've always noticed, like Maury Strong, they are the biggest polluters.
[01:11:58.561 --> 01:12:00.202]  It's just utterly sick.
[01:12:01.662 --> 01:12:04.443]  How they get away with this, and here's another example.
[01:12:04.443 --> 01:12:14.767]  Of the $50 billion given to General Motors, $11 billion was spent to create green factories for, quote, these better cars.
[01:12:14.767 --> 01:12:18.709]  In Eastern Europe, in China and Brazil, U.S.
[01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:23.691]  taxpayers paid to have our factories shut down and moved overseas.
[01:12:24.292 --> 01:12:26.333]  Yeah, it's monstrous, it's monstrous.
[01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:33.455]  And of course, the consequence in America and Britain is that wages are going to be forced down and living standards are forced down.
[01:12:33.455 --> 01:12:42.758]  And the people that are running this whole show tatter steel and their sidekicks get rich at the expense of, well, everywhere.
[01:12:43.308 --> 01:12:57.190]  The fraud is so incredible, I mean, what we just stated is the cold hard facts, and my mind can't believe it, because it's just such, it's, we're paying taxes to have our factories shut!
[01:12:57.190 --> 01:13:11.493]  Yeah, that's exactly right, it's mad, it's complete madness, and you see, some of the politicians probably believe they're saving the planet, but I hope that with Climategate they will realize actually it's a fraud, just like when Tony Blair had his
[01:13:11.946 --> 01:13:14.808]  That is war in Iraq, along with Bush.
[01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:17.490]  I mean, they made up stories to justify it.
[01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.852]  And they believed that any story was good because they were doing it right.
[01:13:20.852 --> 01:13:28.657]  Now, some of them believe that for this, but in the case of Britain, a lot of politicians now realise they were tricks and they don't like it.
[01:13:28.657 --> 01:13:33.580]  And it may happen this time that a lot of politicians will realise now that this is a fraud.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:38.783]  And we'll see things change around the world, I think, in the coming year.
[01:13:38.783 --> 01:13:40.364]  But it won't happen by itself.
[01:13:40.364 --> 01:13:41.245]  We have to fight for it.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.660]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:54.744]  This is devastating to them because now all the previous hockey stick frauds from Mann and Santer's fraud of just removing from the UN's own report that Mann wasn't... Oh yeah, that was monstrous.
[01:13:54.744 --> 01:13:58.365]  I mean, we knew about that at the time, but I was kind of gobsmacked.
[01:13:58.365 --> 01:14:01.586]  However, when we talked about it, no one believed us, you know.
[01:14:01.586 --> 01:14:06.907]  It's just... But now, because some people have been working hard on it, it's come out.
[01:14:06.907 --> 01:14:08.608]  That's a good term, gobsmacked.
[01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.553]  No, I mean, that's how I feel every day.
[01:14:12.553 --> 01:14:21.099]  They're just open criminals, running around stealing, engaged in every form of mischief, and instead of them all being arrested, they're running the planet!
[01:14:21.099 --> 01:14:22.000]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.783]  But we're saying very clearly, the scientists involved in this fraud should be sacked from their jobs, and arrested too!
[01:14:27.783 --> 01:14:31.946]  I mean, where there's, you know, clearly, well, you can prove which individuals have done what.
[01:14:31.946 --> 01:14:35.188]  They're stealing hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer research funds!
[01:14:35.188 --> 01:14:36.049]  Correct, correct.
[01:14:36.429 --> 01:14:37.649]  For quackery.
[01:14:37.649 --> 01:14:41.010]  Speaking of funds, you're not funded by big corporations or governments.
[01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:41.750]  No, we are not.
[01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:45.111]  We receive nothing from governments and you can understand why.
[01:14:45.111 --> 01:14:57.234]  We do receive money from farmers and generally small businesses and sometimes larger businesses, but there's a recession so we don't get much of it.
[01:14:57.234 --> 01:15:00.434]  We're extremely short of money.
[01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:02.475]  We have a small workforce that works
[01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:07.874]  Very hard for what we do, and farmers appreciate us, but farmers aren't well off.
[01:15:07.874 --> 01:15:15.080]  So, you know, anyone who wants to buy anything from us, just whack onto our website, or of course you can also give donations.
[01:15:15.925 --> 01:15:23.006]  I'm about to give you some forecasting for the USA and Canada till December, which we're giving you free, although normally we do charge for it.
[01:15:23.006 --> 01:15:25.667]  But, you know, it's important stuff happening.
[01:15:25.667 --> 01:15:26.307]  Absolutely.
[01:15:26.307 --> 01:15:31.228]  People can go and get great, inexpensive, what have been proven to be very accurate.
[01:15:31.228 --> 01:15:34.589]  Nothing's perfect, but compared to others, very accurate.
[01:15:34.589 --> 01:15:37.569]  They're on the website WeatherAction.com.
[01:15:37.569 --> 01:15:39.169]  One word, WeatherAction.com.
[01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:42.010]  Okay, in the last five minutes we've got, sir, give us your forecast.
[01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:50.496]  Yes, important things happening in the last part, the closing, the last third of December.
[01:15:50.496 --> 01:16:02.466]  Basically between the 19th and 31st there's going to be a series of waves of severe and at times dangerous and wintry weather, both in the USA and Canada.
[01:16:02.466 --> 01:16:07.970]  And the main periods are going to be the 19th to 20th, and there's a lot of them, 22nd to
[01:16:09.727 --> 01:16:16.753]  25th to 27th over Christmas, so keep you indoors, and the 28th to the 30th.
[01:16:16.753 --> 01:16:28.164]  Now that is especially extreme and could involve storms as extreme as the things that happen between the 17th and 19th of November around the world.
[01:16:28.164 --> 01:16:33.609]  That'll be a simultaneous event around the world, but certainly major cold blasts and snowstorms
[01:16:34.065 --> 01:16:34.865]  We're good to go.
[01:17:05.066 --> 01:17:16.305]  And moving into January, January the 5th to the 8th, we'll also see some, quite a lot of extreme events and again we'll clarify the details of that on the website.
[01:17:17.116 --> 01:17:19.999]  What about El Nino and precipitation?
[01:17:19.999 --> 01:17:26.185]  We've had less precipitation than we normally do the last three years on average in the U.S.
[01:17:26.185 --> 01:17:28.688]  A lot of forecasts we're seeing say more precipitation.
[01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:30.730]  Is that lining up with your research?
[01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.352]  Well, yes.
[01:17:32.352 --> 01:17:40.580]  We'll have to, we've got to do a lot more work on American forecasts because our most scale is Britain, Ireland and Europe.
[01:17:41.384 --> 01:17:43.465]  And there's going to be simultaneous events.
[01:17:43.465 --> 01:17:49.806]  You can get them free if you look in Europe, too, as is happening in America.
[01:17:49.806 --> 01:18:01.949]  The main driver, or the pattern, the most significant pattern in America is a kind of 60-year cycle, which is about what's called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
[01:18:01.949 --> 01:18:03.590]  It's about the flow and temperature.
[01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:08.591]  Yeah, the last drought was in the early 50s, and a really bad one, and now we've had another drought.
[01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:11.390]  Well, that's right, you see.
[01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:14.112]  It's about 60 years later, you see.
[01:18:14.112 --> 01:18:21.516]  And these are driven, or let's say, what happens in the Pacific is part of the climate system which gives these things.
[01:18:21.516 --> 01:18:31.982]  And that climate system, the 60-year cycle, can be understood in terms of the lunar modulation of the magnetic cycle of the Sun.
[01:18:31.982 --> 01:18:34.164]  And this is explained on our website in various
[01:18:35.519 --> 01:18:43.965]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the moon drives the ocean, it blocks out solar radiation... That's right.
[01:18:43.965 --> 01:18:57.454]  It interferes with the solar wind, so the plane of the moon's orbit has a period of about... it rotates around the sun every 18... But according to the UN, the sun, the moon, nothing!
[01:18:57.454 --> 01:18:58.935]  Well, they would say that, wouldn't they?
[01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:03.758]  I mean, you know, they have a mission to con us.
[01:19:05.523 --> 01:19:12.148]  But the cons are so big to say polar bears can't swim, their numbers are down, when it's a fraud... Polar bears are doing very well, actually.
[01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:14.049]  Polar bears are doing extremely well.
[01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:22.655]  Anyway, polar bears did very well during, you know, between 10,000 years ago and 1,000 years ago when the world was warmer.
[01:19:22.655 --> 01:19:25.878]  You know, the Eskimos and so on were perfectly happy then.
[01:19:25.878 --> 01:19:28.880]  So for them to say they're feeling threatened is complete nonsense.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.901]  It is utter, utter rubbish.
[01:19:30.901 --> 01:19:31.862]  It's a pack of lies.
[01:19:32.182 --> 01:19:32.502]  It is.
[01:19:32.502 --> 01:19:35.903]  It's utter rubbish to say that the sun doesn't affect climate.
[01:19:35.903 --> 01:19:37.784]  I mean, they actually say that.
[01:19:37.784 --> 01:19:42.045]  This has been an amazing interview with Piers Corbin.
[01:19:42.045 --> 01:19:43.185]  WeatherAction.com.
[01:19:43.185 --> 01:19:46.166]  Our website's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:19:50.648 --> 01:19:52.868]  Bye-bye.
[01:19:52.868 --> 01:19:54.209]  Cheers to you, buddy.
[01:19:54.209 --> 01:19:58.010]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, have a good Christmas.
[01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:00.131]  It's just incredible fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:00.131 --> 01:20:00.831]  We're just fighting it.
[01:20:02.748 --> 01:20:07.350]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:21:01.938 --> 01:21:04.199]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:04.199 --> 01:21:04.639]  December 18, 2009.
[01:21:04.639 --> 01:21:05.620]  Gold opened this morning at $1104.90.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.321]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $1135.16, $567.58 for a half ounce, or $283.79 for the quarter ounce.
[01:21:09.321 --> 01:21:09.762]  That's $1135.16, $568.58, or $283.79.
[01:21:21.494 --> 01:21:35.146]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:21:35.146 --> 01:21:36.387]  Is this capitalism?
[01:21:36.387 --> 01:21:43.973]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:43.973 --> 01:21:45.074]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:45.074 --> 01:21:49.218]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:21:49.418 --> 01:21:50.500]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.364]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:21:52.364 --> 01:21:52.604]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.604 --> 01:21:52.905]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:03.343 --> 01:22:07.365]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:07.365 --> 01:22:10.606]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:10.606 --> 01:22:15.408]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:22:15.408 --> 01:22:21.790]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:24.031]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:22:24.551 --> 01:22:24.891]  Tim Geithner?
[01:22:24.891 --> 01:22:25.392]  Bernanke?
[01:22:25.392 --> 01:22:26.072]  They're arsonists!
[01:22:26.072 --> 01:22:27.353]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:27.353 --> 01:22:29.915]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:29.915 --> 01:22:31.736]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:31.736 --> 01:22:33.298]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[01:22:47.848 --> 01:22:50.750]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:59.874]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:23:01.937 --> 01:23:03.919]  Listen carefully to this message.
[01:23:03.919 --> 01:23:07.423]  If you're about to buy hardwood flooring, you're going to pay too much.
[01:23:07.423 --> 01:23:09.085]  Unless, of course, you buy from us.
[01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:14.390]  We're Lumber Liquidators and no one, including those big box stores, can sell wood flooring for less.
[01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:20.617]  When you buy your quality hardwood flooring from Lumber Liquidators, you save hundreds, if not thousands, every time.
[01:23:20.617 --> 01:23:22.699]  Because we buy direct from the mills.
[01:23:22.699 --> 01:23:24.681]  We are truly the wood floor experts.

[01:23:29.242 --> 01:23:30.483]  Call 1-800-390-1240.
[01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:35.144]  It's filled with top-quality hardwood flooring for less.
[01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:41.806]  Solid hardwoods in cherry, oak, and walnut, bamboo, laminates, and even bellowood prefinished flooring with a 50-year warranty.
[01:23:41.806 --> 01:23:43.686]  The same floor Bob Vila has in his home.
[01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.547]  Don't pay more than you have to for flooring?
[01:23:45.547 --> 01:23:47.267]  Call Lumber Liquidators now.
[01:23:47.267 --> 01:23:49.348]  We even offer installation and financing.
[01:23:49.688 --> 01:23:53.050]  Visit your local Lumber Liquidators or call now for your free catalog, 1-800-390-1240.
[01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:53.370]  That's 1-800-390-1240.
[01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:53.430]  1-800-390-1240.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:39.729]  My head really does spin sometimes that they're telling school children in government-produced documentaries that penguins are drowning and that polar bears are drowning.
[01:24:39.729 --> 01:24:41.991]  They actually say it!
[01:24:41.991 --> 01:24:42.652]  For years!
[01:24:42.652 --> 01:24:45.755]  I saw it again two, three weeks ago on KXAN locally in Austin.
[01:24:47.099 --> 01:24:54.020]  I've seen speeches at the Copenhagen event in the last week, and I'm hardly even watching it, where they're saying the polar bears will all disappear.
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:25:02.582]  They've got giant billboards up saying, don't let the polar bears die, and giant billboards of a little girl saying, please don't let me drown.
[01:25:02.582 --> 01:25:13.864]  They're telling kids the ocean, like the day after tomorrow, funded by Globalist, is going to come crashing over with 500 foot waves, knocking over the Empire State's building.
[01:25:15.441 --> 01:25:29.146]  I mean, it's as ridiculous as saying giant flying saucers are going to land and thousands of Marvin the Martians are going to march off with ray guns if we don't pay Al Gore money.
[01:25:29.146 --> 01:25:36.449]  The UN on Monday came out and again countered and said the sun does not affect climate.
[01:25:37.441 --> 01:25:41.763]  And then millions of zombies went, the sun does not affect climate.
[01:25:41.763 --> 01:25:43.904]  The sun does not affect climate.
[01:25:43.904 --> 01:25:48.727]  Jumping off cliffs does not break your legs.
[01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:53.089]  Jumping in front of 18 wheelers going 100 miles an hour will not hurt you.
[01:25:53.089 --> 01:25:55.310]  I love Al Gore.
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:56.891]  I love being an idiot.
[01:25:56.891 --> 01:25:58.132]  I love being a zombie.
[01:25:58.132 --> 01:26:00.793]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:26:00.793 --> 01:26:05.276]  And now, of course, it's come out, not just the White House memo, not just the Downing Street memo,
[01:26:06.499 --> 01:26:15.445]  But yes, it's come out in the last two weeks that Tony Blair, this is BBC reporting, confirms that Tony Blair knew there were no WMDs.
[01:26:15.445 --> 01:26:18.167]  Of course they knew there were no WMDs.
[01:26:18.167 --> 01:26:23.391]  Of course they consciously knew and lied and went to war.
[01:26:23.391 --> 01:26:26.513]  Not, oh they thought they were there and they were wrong.
[01:26:26.513 --> 01:26:27.494]  They knew.
[01:26:27.494 --> 01:26:30.136]  They lied.
[01:26:30.136 --> 01:26:33.238]  For five years we've had the minutes of the meetings between Blair and Bush.
[01:26:34.414 --> 01:26:36.735]  Where Bush said, we're going to do this and we've got to make it up.
[01:26:36.735 --> 01:26:38.855]  And they said, okay, how do we shoot down U.S.
[01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:40.475]  planes and blame it on Saddam?
[01:26:40.475 --> 01:26:42.516]  How do we stage a terror attack?
[01:26:42.516 --> 01:26:44.696]  This is all mainstream news.
[01:26:44.696 --> 01:26:49.117]  And they're like, yeah, we staged terror attacks.
[01:26:49.117 --> 01:26:54.479]  You know, they tried that deal where they put out the radio transmission that we're going to blow up your ship.
[01:26:54.479 --> 01:26:57.799]  We're going to blow up your ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:26:57.799 --> 01:27:00.300]  When a Iranian patrol boat was a mile and a half away.
[01:27:01.874 --> 01:27:04.975]  Trying to get the people on the ship to open fire on the patrol boat.
[01:27:04.975 --> 01:27:08.756]  And they did it over and over and over again with Navy SEALs out there.
[01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.637]  They didn't just plan it, they did it.
[01:27:10.637 --> 01:27:13.878]  Running around broadcasting, we're gonna blow you up.
[01:27:13.878 --> 01:27:18.360]  And I guess the SEALs thought they were just so macho they were gonna take fire on their boat.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.401]  I mean, how do they get these guys to engage in this type of treason?
[01:27:23.899 --> 01:27:25.200]  Well, that's what tough guys do.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.201]  Alex, you're just not tough.
[01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:29.783]  You don't know how to stage terror attacks.
[01:27:29.783 --> 01:27:41.032]  Because even if blowing up the World Trade Centers killed 3,000, if we don't fight the Arabs, they're going to take over the world!
[01:27:41.032 --> 01:27:48.758]  And America's weak and had to be taught and had to be shown a lesson so they'd get behind defending our sovereignty and stopping the Muslims.
[01:27:50.285 --> 01:28:01.912]  And that in every case, the radical Muslims are funded by our government, on record, and used to overthrow mainline and moderate and secular governments in the Middle East and Central Asia!
[01:28:01.912 --> 01:28:11.758]  Yes, I know there are wild-eyed Muslims that want to chop your head off and drown their daughters, because our stinking government and the British government put them in power!
[01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:14.740]  Our criminal government likes to deal with dictatorships!
[01:28:19.141 --> 01:28:23.062]  They like to deal with thugs.
[01:28:23.062 --> 01:28:27.184]  Yes, I get the whole Islamic fascism thing.
[01:28:27.184 --> 01:28:28.664]  Made in America.
[01:28:28.664 --> 01:28:29.545]  Made in England.
[01:28:29.545 --> 01:28:31.745]  Made in Israel.
[01:28:31.745 --> 01:28:35.387]  Did those people exist before without the globalists helping them?
[01:28:35.387 --> 01:28:37.027]  Yes.
[01:28:37.027 --> 01:28:38.828]  Yes.
[01:28:38.828 --> 01:28:45.690]  Kind of like an acorn existed before it was buried by a squirrel.
[01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:48.011]  And then watered and loved and taken care of.
[01:28:50.276 --> 01:29:04.488]  And then now is used to menace the West to give up all of our rights in the name of fighting the dangerous brown-skinned men that wear turbans that look funny.
[01:29:04.488 --> 01:29:09.171]  But then you find out it's all a Hollywood production.
[01:29:09.171 --> 01:29:13.275]  And you get the Homeland Security documents that we got and we broke.
[01:29:15.231 --> 01:29:17.735]  And it said, first people couldn't believe it.
[01:29:17.735 --> 01:29:19.358]  Then it came out, was it real?
[01:29:19.358 --> 01:29:25.568]  And people said, I guess it's alright if veterans are the number one threat and Homeland Security is really set up for American gun owners.
[01:29:27.441 --> 01:29:33.582]  That is a treasonous, larcenous, treacherous, criminal, illegitimate government.
[01:29:33.582 --> 01:29:38.143]  It's a corporate group of crooks that have hijacked the nation.
[01:29:38.143 --> 01:29:52.706]  Now, I know you know that, but we better get that message out to everybody we know, or these people are going to succeed in starting World War III with the American people.
[01:29:52.706 --> 01:29:54.107]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.107 --> 01:29:55.607]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.623 --> 01:29:59.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.574 --> 01:30:05.576]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:05.576 --> 01:30:10.920]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.961]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:17.964]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:17.964 --> 01:30:19.145]  How much do you want?
[01:30:19.145 --> 01:30:20.266]  When do you want it?
[01:30:20.266 --> 01:30:22.147]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:22.147 --> 01:30:23.228]  When will you need it?
[01:30:23.228 --> 01:30:25.429]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:25.429 --> 01:30:26.770]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:28.091]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:33.555]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:33.555 --> 01:30:37.137]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:37.137 --> 01:30:40.960]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.181]  How much will you need?
[01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:43.082]  We don't know.
[01:30:43.082 --> 01:30:44.183]  How much do you want?
[01:30:44.183 --> 01:30:45.123]  All you can get.
[01:30:45.123 --> 01:30:45.924]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:46.204 --> 01:30:49.269]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:32:01.354 --> 01:32:06.660]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:11.185]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:11.185 --> 01:32:13.468]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:13.468 --> 01:32:15.090]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:15.090 --> 01:32:16.131]  There is a solution.

[01:33:13.086 --> 01:33:14.887]  We've only got him for one segment.
[01:33:14.887 --> 01:33:18.430]  He's with us for a full hour on January 30th.
[01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:22.152]  Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:33:22.152 --> 01:33:24.774]  And I wanted to get him on with his perspective on Copenhagen.
[01:33:24.774 --> 01:33:27.295]  Of course, he worked with the National Security Agency.
[01:33:27.295 --> 01:33:30.458]  He's written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[01:33:30.458 --> 01:33:36.141]  Every time I'm watching a national security hearing in the House or Senate, I see Wayne Madsen back there taking notes.
[01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:38.523]  And I wanted to get him on to get his take on Copenhagen.
[01:33:38.523 --> 01:33:39.824]  Had no idea what his take would be.
[01:33:39.824 --> 01:33:42.766]  Of course, it's my take exactly, because it's just the truth.
[01:33:43.606 --> 01:33:46.588]  That it's a total banker takeover, but we'll get his take on that.
[01:33:46.588 --> 01:33:54.233]  So see, you don't just have the climate gate coming out and people on the right saying they don't want new taxes.
[01:33:54.233 --> 01:33:57.895]  The left is finding out it's an IMF World Bank takeover.
[01:33:57.895 --> 01:34:01.158]  So we'll talk about that, then we'll get his take on health care.
[01:34:01.158 --> 01:34:03.959]  It's not just in trouble with conservatives.
[01:34:03.959 --> 01:34:04.720]  Now the left
[01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:07.691]  The head of the Democratic Party is against it.
[01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:08.631]  Dean.
[01:34:08.631 --> 01:34:09.211]  Kucinich.
[01:34:09.211 --> 01:34:13.013]  They say this isn't just a bailout, it's a robbery.
[01:34:13.013 --> 01:34:14.253]  Well, I told you that months ago.
[01:34:14.253 --> 01:34:16.014]  It was written by the insurance companies.
[01:34:16.014 --> 01:34:18.294]  We're going to get Wayne Madsen's take on that.
[01:34:18.294 --> 01:34:25.417]  So, the more we learn about the Copenhagen Agreement, the more we learn about the health care agreement, we find out why they want to keep them secret.
[01:34:25.417 --> 01:34:29.338]  Because the minute you see them, you find out it's just like the banker bailout.
[01:34:29.338 --> 01:34:30.379]  I call it the rape-out.
[01:34:30.979 --> 01:34:33.202]  It wasn't a bailout, they just robbed us.
[01:34:33.202 --> 01:34:37.086]  And so anything that happens, Republican or Democrat, will be a robbery.
[01:34:37.086 --> 01:34:43.333]  Wayne Madsen, good to have you on with us.
[01:34:43.333 --> 01:34:45.616]  We didn't have you punched up, sorry Wayne.
[01:34:45.616 --> 01:34:47.277]  Wayne, go ahead, good to have you with us.
[01:34:47.277 --> 01:34:47.778]  Hi Alex.
[01:34:49.435 --> 01:34:50.055]  Good to have you here.
[01:34:50.055 --> 01:34:59.718]  Okay, break down Copenhagen, break down your take on healthcare, and then I want to get your take on Russia saying they may engage in preemptive war now because of NATO and U.S.
[01:34:59.718 --> 01:35:00.138]  policy.
[01:35:00.138 --> 01:35:01.279]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:16.123]  Well, certainly with this Copenhagen thing has turned into a, you know, basically a three-ring circus, and I think a lot of people who went over there who had justified fears that wherever they came from in the world, whether it was low-lying South Pacific islands,
[01:35:16.932 --> 01:35:24.037]  Or in the Andes, where the glaciers are disappearing and the water is becoming scarcer.
[01:35:24.037 --> 01:35:27.379]  They all went to Copenhagen thinking something good was going to happen.
[01:35:27.379 --> 01:35:37.346]  They're looking there now and seeing George Soros, Hillary Clinton with billions of dollars at stake, this carbon exchange program.
[01:35:37.346 --> 01:35:41.889]  I think the carbon exchange is something Bernie Madoff is now wishing he was
[01:35:43.422 --> 01:35:45.743]  Out of prison and involved with.
[01:35:45.743 --> 01:35:47.484]  Uh, he's probably kicking himself.
[01:35:47.484 --> 01:35:49.765]  Well, Ken Lay didn't invent it, I mean.
[01:35:49.765 --> 01:35:55.528]  Right, and uh, so what, what's all these people, what have they encountered in Copenhagen?
[01:35:55.528 --> 01:36:04.033]  But, but police, um, tear-gassing them, arresting them en masse, just like we saw at the anti-G8 meetings.
[01:36:04.033 --> 01:36:09.216]  Uh, just as we saw it at Davos and other places where these same people get together.
[01:36:09.216 --> 01:36:11.637]  And uh, I think many people
[01:36:12.685 --> 01:36:24.471]  Who are, you know, members of Greenpeace, Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund, you know, people, you know, concerned about the environment and the climate are looking and saying, what in the world is this mess?
[01:36:24.471 --> 01:36:31.934]  And, you know, to see their, you know, their supporters, you know, people from indigenous areas around the world being arrested on masks.
[01:36:31.934 --> 01:36:39.658]  You know, you've got Hugo Chavez going to Copenhagen, Abel Morales to Bolivia, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, they're looking at their
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.501]  Fellow countrymen being arrested, they're shaking their heads, and they're looking around, who do they see?
[01:36:44.501 --> 01:36:46.882]  They see the usual suspect, Obama.
[01:36:46.882 --> 01:36:52.564]  I'm surprised Tony Blair, he probably wanted to be there, but he may be facing more crime charges soon.
[01:36:52.564 --> 01:36:55.665]  He tried to run for President of Europe, and he lost that.
[01:36:55.665 --> 01:37:03.047]  But it's that same crowd, they're looking around at these people, who you see at all these various global meetings, and they're shaking their heads.
[01:37:03.047 --> 01:37:07.468]  They said, you know, I'm sure they're thinking, this isn't a double-cross, this is really like a triple-cross.
[01:37:09.485 --> 01:37:14.108]  That's right, they suckered the third world and said you're going to get a bunch of loot from the West.
[01:37:14.108 --> 01:37:20.512]  They show up, they get the actual treaty and it says they've got to make right at double the carbon cuts the West does.
[01:37:20.512 --> 01:37:25.836]  And the money's not even paid to the UN, it's paid directly to the World Bank and the IMF.
[01:37:25.836 --> 01:37:28.117]  I mean, that is a bold fraud.
[01:37:28.117 --> 01:37:31.480]  Right, then you have Soros over there talking about special drawing rights.
[01:37:32.205 --> 01:37:35.267]  Trying to get his hands into the IMF money.
[01:37:35.267 --> 01:37:44.852]  And you know, anytime you see Soros involved with anything, you know, run for the exit, because somebody's going to have their pocket picked pretty liberally.
[01:37:44.852 --> 01:37:46.353]  But he's not certainly the only one.
[01:37:46.353 --> 01:37:48.354]  It's, you know, just this whole crowd.
[01:37:48.354 --> 01:37:49.435]  Ban Ki-moon, the U.N.
[01:37:49.435 --> 01:37:55.398]  Secretary General, you know, he's not liked by a lot of the smaller countries, the developing countries.
[01:37:55.398 --> 01:37:59.160]  They know he's a proxy for the United States and U.S.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.281]  allies in the banking
[01:38:00.768 --> 01:38:02.229]  This is like Kurt Vonnegut satire!
[01:38:22.726 --> 01:38:23.827]  It really is insane.
[01:38:23.827 --> 01:38:25.568]  So what do you see coming out of this?
[01:38:25.568 --> 01:38:27.070]  An agreement to agree?
[01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:30.733]  Because Obama's saying he doesn't care if the world doesn't sign on.
[01:38:30.733 --> 01:38:33.056]  We're going to play the speech later.
[01:38:33.056 --> 01:38:40.243]  He's saying he's going to go ahead and pledge the money to the World Bank to then give loan sharking rate loans to the third world.
[01:38:40.243 --> 01:38:41.764]  That's their assistance.
[01:38:41.764 --> 01:38:44.487]  The third world's already learned about that assistance.
[01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:49.499]  Well, I think what we're going to see is basically a gridlock out of Copenhagen.
[01:38:49.499 --> 01:38:53.863]  There'll be some kind of motherhood apple pie statement.
[01:38:53.863 --> 01:39:06.773]  You know, people will smile and say they agree to it, but there'll be a lot of world leaders leaving there, especially those from Africa, Latin America, South Pacific, Asia, shaking their heads and saying, this isn't what we expected.
[01:39:06.773 --> 01:39:11.837]  This was typical of these big countries, the Western countries, and I think
[01:39:12.438 --> 01:39:23.606]  Uh, then we'll probably hear about some future meetings somewhere, and we'll get a lot of propaganda about, I don't know where it'll be, and it may be some other city, uh, we've already been seeing them in Kyoto and Jakarta.
[01:39:23.606 --> 01:39:28.949]  They'll probably pick up, pick up, pick out some other city, and it, you know, this is gonna probably become like the Olympics.
[01:39:28.949 --> 01:39:32.812]  Everybody's gonna try to get this Climate Change Conference to make some money.
[01:39:35.499 --> 01:39:42.088]  Shifting gears to the war, for those that don't know, maybe give them some background.
[01:39:42.088 --> 01:39:47.935]  Of course, the Downing Street memo, the White House memo, it's confirmed that Blair and Bush knew there were no WMDs.
[01:39:47.935 --> 01:39:49.958]  It's not that they screwed up and were wrong.
[01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:52.951]  They lied premeditatedly.
[01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:53.692]  They wanted the oil.
[01:39:53.692 --> 01:39:54.792]  They wanted the weapon sales.
[01:39:54.792 --> 01:40:04.918]  They wanted to box in Iran and China and Russia and get their set pieces in there for future conflicts like 888 that blew up in their face, thank God.
[01:40:04.918 --> 01:40:10.582]  But now more is coming out that Blair knew was premeditated.
[01:40:10.582 --> 01:40:13.424]  And so there's talk of war crimes, charges against him.
[01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:15.825]  Obama is expanding the war.
[01:40:15.825 --> 01:40:20.548]  I mean, what is the rest of the world saying about this?
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:27.601]  Well, I think what we're seeing with Tony Blair, he's now going to be testifying before the Chilcot Inquiry in London.
[01:40:27.601 --> 01:40:38.804]  We've seen already some testimony that's pretty explosive out of there, saying that Blair, of course, knew there was no WMDs, decided to go to war against Iraq anyway.
[01:40:38.804 --> 01:40:45.965]  You know, preemptive warfare is against the Nuremberg, what we got out of the Nuremberg trials, is the war crime.
[01:40:45.965 --> 01:40:49.106]  And I think we're going to see greater calls for Tony Blair
[01:40:49.795 --> 01:40:58.639]  To be prosecuted in the Hague, and if that happens, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld better watch out because they may be in fact next.
[01:40:58.639 --> 01:41:00.119]  Blair may set a precedent.
[01:41:00.119 --> 01:41:08.523]  Now Blair's going to be testifying in public, we understand, and it'll be very interesting to hear what he has to say, but obviously he's been caught.
[01:41:08.523 --> 01:41:11.224]  He's been caught with his pants down on this one.
[01:41:11.224 --> 01:41:14.245]  Now he may try to get out of it by saying, you know, he wanted to be
[01:41:14.767 --> 01:41:21.108]  A good ally to George Bush, and if that happens, then of course the onus will shift to Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney.
[01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.789]  And notice they've been hiding out.
[01:41:22.789 --> 01:41:24.809]  You never see them anymore.
[01:41:24.809 --> 01:41:39.452]  Yeah, Cheney was kind of active with his mouth a few months ago, but I noticed he's been, he's probably, he's working on his memoirs, supposedly, and they're going to be out apparently in 2011, but he's probably spending a lot of time at his
[01:41:40.245 --> 01:41:47.829]  Nice home over on the eastern shore of Maryland, or out of his private country club community in Wyoming.
[01:41:47.829 --> 01:41:50.470]  Or he's in the Darth Vader egg.
[01:41:50.470 --> 01:42:09.319]  Right, well he also has a big house he built right near the CIA headquarters in McLean, Virginia, but he's probably, being the Artful Dodger, he's probably going between the various homes, so in case there is any Interpol arrest warrant put out, he's probably going to be pretty hard to nap.
[01:42:10.506 --> 01:42:13.707]  I don't think they're going to let Interpol go after Lord Cheney.
[01:42:13.707 --> 01:42:19.928]  But in closing, Wayne Madsen, I want to get into health care.
[01:42:19.928 --> 01:42:27.469]  Now, folks, I've been telling people since we got the first versions of these bills five, six months ago, there's been, I don't know, more than 10 versions now.
[01:42:27.469 --> 01:42:32.750]  Every one of the versions was written and their lobbyists have bragged to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:39.531]  The head lobbyist for the health care industry and the other head lobbyist because they have consortium leaders for the insurance companies.
[01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:40.791]  I don't
[01:43:01.228 --> 01:43:05.311]  And it gives liability protection to the insurance companies and the doctors.
[01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:10.354]  It does federalize and let bureaucrats start setting the treatments for people.
[01:43:10.354 --> 01:43:13.256]  It cuts back on tests that are essential.
[01:43:13.256 --> 01:43:15.358]  This is eugenics.
[01:43:15.358 --> 01:43:18.600]  And now the actual socialists have discovered this.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.462]  So Howard Dean is freaking out.
[01:43:20.462 --> 01:43:21.983]  Dennis Kucinich is freaking out.
[01:43:22.723 --> 01:43:25.506]  And the bill was already in trouble.
[01:43:25.506 --> 01:43:34.393]  Break down what's really in the bill, why we are seeing some actual honesty from the Democratic Party, some sectors of it, and what you think is going to happen with this bill.
[01:43:34.393 --> 01:43:35.654]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:43:35.654 --> 01:43:45.002]  Well, what we saw come out of the bill was a proposal to extend Medicare benefits to people 55 and older.
[01:43:45.002 --> 01:43:47.244]  That was taken out.
[01:43:47.244 --> 01:43:48.765]  Joe Lieberman went after that one.
[01:43:49.404 --> 01:43:54.188]  We also saw another proposal to have a public option basically emaciated.
[01:43:54.188 --> 01:44:10.920]  That's why the Obama administration and their congressional supporters have lost the support of people like Howard Dean, Russ Feingold, all people I might add who may be potential challengers to Mr. Obama in the 2012 primary.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:16.284]  We're hearing a lot more about him maybe even having more potential challengers than Lyndon Johnson had in 1968.
[01:44:17.381 --> 01:44:22.483]  Unpopularity over the war, the healthcare fiasco.
[01:44:22.483 --> 01:44:28.265]  Johnson, of course, had Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy and decided he wasn't going to run again.
[01:44:28.265 --> 01:44:36.408]  But Obama may face actually more challengers than Mr. Johnson did in his final term.
[01:44:36.408 --> 01:44:43.230]  But what we're seeing is now we're hearing calls that people may refuse en masse to pay the fine nationwide.
[01:44:43.755 --> 01:44:45.937]  These are not coming from teabaggers.
[01:44:45.937 --> 01:44:49.940]  These are coming from people who are on the progressive side of the Democratic Party.
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:53.323]  So it's a very interesting dynamic we're seeing here.
[01:44:53.323 --> 01:45:01.810]  The loud protests and, you know, talking about, you know, we'll just, you know, massively refuse to pay the fine.
[01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:03.171]  It's coming from the left.
[01:45:03.171 --> 01:45:05.933]  And I'm not sure that's what Mr. Obama bargained for.
[01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:10.397]  I'll tell you one guy in Washington that's not very popular is Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff.
[01:45:10.397 --> 01:45:13.239]  I mean, there are calls for his head.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:23.560]  Uh, from some of the people on the progressive side of the Democratic Party in Congress, and I'd be surprised to see Mr. Emanuel last much past the New Year.
[01:45:23.871 --> 01:45:24.311]  That's right.
[01:45:24.311 --> 01:45:43.645]  Politico and The Hill, both DC-based publications for folks that aren't aware of the fact that they're not just web publications but based out of DC, they're both saying that Emanuel just calls up and screams at senior congressmen in a Hitlerian fashion.
[01:45:43.645 --> 01:45:45.146]  That is going to blow up in their face.
[01:45:46.127 --> 01:45:47.689]  I've seen this with hype machines.
[01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:53.435]  The bigger they build something up, if it doesn't deliver, it implodes even faster.
[01:45:53.435 --> 01:45:59.041]  And Obama, for the last six months, has had the lowest approval rating of any president this far into
[01:46:00.856 --> 01:46:06.378]  His first year and now he's even breaking his own records.
[01:46:06.378 --> 01:46:24.045]  I mean, I mean, it is a dive straight downward because people are finding out this is a warmongering, police state loving, secret arresting, rendition promoting, lobbyist hiring, neocon, masquerading as a communist.
[01:46:24.045 --> 01:46:26.266]  You know, and I hear people call him a communist.
[01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:27.587]  No, he's a corporate looter.
[01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.829]  Right, right.
[01:46:28.829 --> 01:46:34.312]  And then I hear a lot of people now talking about this being the third term of George W. Bush.
[01:46:34.312 --> 01:46:36.452]  I mean, and these are serious people.
[01:46:36.452 --> 01:46:41.114]  I mean, they're joking, but they're really kind of serious in making those allegations.
[01:46:41.114 --> 01:46:50.738]  But the other thing that's interesting is we have a federal judge now who's been assigned the Rod Blagojevich criminal case in Illinois now stating that he would not be opposed to the defense.
[01:46:50.738 --> 01:46:54.360]  Blagojevich's defense lawyer is calling his witnesses.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.261]  Mr. Emanuel, get ready for this, Mr. Obama.
[01:46:57.936 --> 01:47:24.777]  And on that whole thing with the selling of the Obama Senate seat, if that happens, if the President will try to invoke executive privilege, and so will probably Emanuel, I don't know how he'll do it, though, because all this happened before they were sworn in, or became, you know, in case of Obama sworn in, Emanuel being appointed chief of staff, but we could have a real constitutional crisis on top of everything else, and that just does not bode well for this administration if that should occur.
[01:47:25.285 --> 01:47:26.526]  Well, that starts happening.
[01:47:26.526 --> 01:47:35.449]  Look for Blagojevich's aircraft to blow up, or for him to have a sudden aneurysm, or a 72-hour brain tumor.
[01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:36.090]  Absolutely.
[01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:50.696]  Well, we'll have to see how that one goes, but we all remember the hype when Bill Clinton, of course, had to testify in the Paul Jones case with the independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
[01:47:50.696 --> 01:47:53.017]  We had talk of a constitutional crisis there.
[01:47:53.781 --> 01:48:00.863]  Uh, but that certainly did not do much for Clinton's poll numbers when you have the sitting president testifying, uh, in a case like that.
[01:48:00.863 --> 01:48:11.407]  Uh, we may see the same thing happen to Mr. Obama and, of course, Emanuel and David Axelrod, uh, Valerie Jarrett and other key members of this administration.
[01:48:11.407 --> 01:48:14.708]  So do you think, uh, the healthcare is gonna pass?
[01:48:14.708 --> 01:48:16.068]  I think it'll pass.
[01:48:16.068 --> 01:48:20.470]  Um, I mean, it's not gonna be, it's not, what we see come out isn't gonna be very much.
[01:48:21.303 --> 01:48:28.248]  I think people who were hoping to see something for people who are uninsured are going to be sadly disappointed.
[01:48:28.248 --> 01:48:46.001]  You know, the fact is, the guy that this all hinges on is Joe Lieberman, the guy who supported McCain in the last election, was Al Gore's running mate, of course, in 2000, who was put in the Senate from Connecticut because William Buckley hated
[01:48:46.482 --> 01:48:48.943]  Well Wayne, my issue is, anything they do, even if you're for
[01:49:10.450 --> 01:49:14.332]  Well, I think obviously you're looking at NATO now coming right up to their borders.
[01:49:14.332 --> 01:49:16.173]  We have the NATO Secretary General
[01:49:38.779 --> 01:49:42.742]  Rasmussen, who was the former Danish Prime Minister, he's a neocon.
[01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:49.007]  I mean, so he's going to basically do everything on the neocon playlist.
[01:49:49.007 --> 01:49:55.351]  And they're looking at all this, and they're saying, well, if you're going to play hardball with us, we can play hardball back.
[01:49:55.351 --> 01:50:03.597]  And I think we're going to see a lot more elements that are going to look like the Cold War, but I don't think we'll ever go back to those days.
[01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:05.759]  But there'll be a lot of grandstanding, certainly.
[01:50:06.612 --> 01:50:07.533]  And you know the U.S.
[01:50:07.533 --> 01:50:15.857]  and Russia still have not agreed on the nuclear reduction, nuclear weapons reduction.
[01:50:15.857 --> 01:50:19.219]  And why is the West menacing Russia?
[01:50:19.219 --> 01:50:27.743]  Yeah, I mean Obama doesn't want to do much on that and there's a lot of complaints even out of the State Department that Obama's dragging his feet on this.
[01:50:27.743 --> 01:50:30.804]  But why is the West menacing Russia?
[01:50:30.804 --> 01:50:33.746]  Well, obviously they aren't going along with the program.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:43.387]  Yeah, you know, the issue of the breakaway regions of Georgia being recognized, that's just one of many issues.
[01:50:43.387 --> 01:50:47.530]  And Russia now supporting the progressive governments in Latin America.
[01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:49.851]  That's right in what the U.S.
[01:50:49.851 --> 01:50:55.356]  considers its backyard, and obviously the neocons were still very much present in the Obama administration.
[01:50:55.356 --> 01:50:55.636]  Okay.
[01:50:55.636 --> 01:50:56.436]  Wayne, we're out of time.
[01:50:56.436 --> 01:50:58.198]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:50:58.198 --> 01:51:00.139]  We'll talk to you coming up January 30th.
[01:51:00.139 --> 01:51:00.900]  Have a great Christmas.
[01:51:02.557 --> 01:51:03.858]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.858 --> 01:51:09.460]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:14.462]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:14.462 --> 01:51:20.044]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:20.044 --> 01:51:24.726]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:25.253 --> 01:51:32.375]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:32.375 --> 01:51:33.495]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:33.495 --> 01:51:36.276]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:36.276 --> 01:51:40.177]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:40.177 --> 01:51:43.377]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:26.533]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:52:26.633 --> 01:52:30.996]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:52:30.996 --> 01:52:35.560]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.642]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:52:37.642 --> 01:52:39.803]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:52:39.803 --> 01:52:41.725]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:52:41.725 --> 01:52:47.430]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:50.432]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[01:53:59.631 --> 01:54:01.892]  The Smoking Gun heard round the world.
[01:54:01.892 --> 01:54:05.814]  Strange days have found us.
[01:54:05.814 --> 01:54:11.317]  Strange days have dragged us down.
[01:54:35.879 --> 01:54:43.354]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, Robert Wannick, a high school student who's been really active.
[01:54:45.482 --> 01:54:51.987]  Yeah, 9-11 truth and exposing the war and exposing the phony left-right paradigm.
[01:54:51.987 --> 01:54:59.732]  He also, I think was the second or third place winner of our flu vaccine or slash poster contest.
[01:54:59.732 --> 01:55:14.962]  We said put up whatever posters you want in that contest, but a lot of people chose to expose that the flu vaccine insert said it could cause cancer, could cause brain damage, could cause neurological disorders, had mercury in it, could sterilize you or hurt your fertility.
[01:55:16.222 --> 01:55:17.963]  Lower your fertility.
[01:55:17.963 --> 01:55:20.184]  Create infertility.
[01:55:20.184 --> 01:55:27.486]  And he was just handing out the inserts at his government training camp, trying to warn his fellow students, and was assaulted by a teacher.
[01:55:27.486 --> 01:55:31.308]  Because in America, you don't talk to fellow slaves.
[01:55:31.308 --> 01:55:33.168]  Not in a lockdown prison.
[01:55:33.168 --> 01:55:34.589]  You're learning how to live like a Soviet.
[01:55:36.007 --> 01:55:39.869]  And so we're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:39.869 --> 01:55:42.351]  We did four hours yesterday at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:42.351 --> 01:55:45.613]  We're just doing an hour and 52 minutes today at the 8 After.
[01:55:45.613 --> 01:55:56.680]  When we start the second segment of the next hour, we will simulcast the last half of the show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:02.284]  And Robert Wannick is joining us and then John Schaefer of the
[01:56:04.881 --> 01:56:08.623]  Rock band Iced Earth is going to be joining us in studio.
[01:56:08.623 --> 01:56:17.169]  Great new album, so you don't want to miss that world premiere here on air for that.
[01:56:17.169 --> 01:56:20.371]  His lyrics are excellent.
[01:56:20.371 --> 01:56:25.034]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, in the Fed, in the Fed, in the Fed.
[01:56:25.034 --> 01:56:30.357]  Certainly a powerful new tool in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:56:31.892 --> 01:56:38.855]  Now, what I'm going to do when we go live at 8 after is in two segments, I'm going to play Obama's speech.
[01:56:38.855 --> 01:56:41.616]  I already started this, but only got like two minutes into it.
[01:56:41.616 --> 01:56:50.199]  I'm going to play his 10-minute, 42-second speech, and I'm going to try to focus and just pause it.
[01:56:50.199 --> 01:56:53.520]  When he tells lies, the problem is everything's a lie.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.861]  Everything's a fraud.
[01:56:54.861 --> 01:56:55.861]  And go over it.
[01:56:55.861 --> 01:56:57.722]  And then we can post that on YouTube and everywhere else.
[01:56:57.722 --> 01:57:01.043]  Of course, it will first be posted at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:57:03.208 --> 01:57:05.972]  And we'll be simulcasting live for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:05.972 --> 01:57:14.522]  Members, speaking of PrisonPlanet.tv, why fight the traffic for holiday gifts, for business gifts, for corporate gifts, for family gifts?
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.982]  I know I'm not fighting traffic.
[01:57:16.982 --> 01:57:26.191]  We're doing stuff like making cookies and fudge and fun stuff to do with the kids and making homemade cards.
[01:57:26.191 --> 01:57:28.854]  That's the kind of stuff family likes anyways.
[01:57:28.854 --> 01:57:32.077]  Don't go out there and get yourself into a bunch of debt, folks, during the holidays.
[01:57:32.077 --> 01:57:35.941]  If you do have money to spend, give them a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:57:35.941 --> 01:57:37.223]  Get a trial membership, $5.95 a month.
[01:57:38.624 --> 01:57:42.886]  Create the username, password, and then send it as an e-card to friends and family.
[01:57:42.886 --> 01:57:45.507]  Six people can simultaneously log on with the passcode.
[01:57:45.507 --> 01:57:52.870]  So you can give yourself a prisonplanet.tv membership, and then I'm letting you know that six IP addresses can... Well, that's not how it works.
[01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:56.052]  It's six people can log on according to that passcode.
[01:57:56.052 --> 01:57:56.652]  That's how it works.
[01:57:59.013 --> 01:58:02.317]  Blocks it until the person gets off.
[01:58:02.317 --> 01:58:04.419]  But you can share it with some friends and family.
[01:58:04.419 --> 01:58:06.481]  That's my gift to you.
[01:58:06.481 --> 01:58:11.967]  And you can see the live TV show, the best archives of the radio show, my book, Paul Watson's book, all my other films.
[01:58:11.967 --> 01:58:13.229]  It's an armory of resistance.
[01:58:13.229 --> 01:58:16.052]  Burn them to the DivX CD.
[01:58:16.052 --> 01:58:16.693]  Give it to people.
[01:58:18.602 --> 01:58:31.847]  Or you can get free t-shirts and DVDs right now when you order Fall of the Republic and there's a bunch of other free deals and combos at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:31.847 --> 01:58:35.868]  But if you don't have the money, I really don't care.
[01:58:35.868 --> 01:58:37.489]  All the films are free online.
[01:58:37.489 --> 01:58:39.910]  Just Google the name of Fall of the Republic and watch it.
[01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:40.630]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.630 --> 01:58:43.991]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.991 --> 01:58:45.692]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:47.228 --> 01:58:52.052]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.052 --> 01:58:56.616]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:56.616 --> 01:59:00.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:06.705]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:06.705 --> 01:59:07.446]  It's true.
[01:59:07.446 --> 01:59:12.010]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:13.131]  Number 3.
[01:59:13.131 --> 01:59:16.714]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:16.714 --> 01:59:20.637]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:20.637 --> 01:59:21.437]  Number 4.
[01:59:21.437 --> 01:59:24.199]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:24.199 --> 01:59:27.882]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:27.882 --> 01:59:28.663]  Number 5.
[01:59:28.663 --> 01:59:32.806]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:32.806 --> 01:59:37.570]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:42.011]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.011 --> 01:59:43.812]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:43.812 --> 01:59:46.072]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:46.072 --> 01:59:48.353]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:48.353 --> 01:59:49.273]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:49.273 --> 01:59:50.534]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:50.534 --> 01:59:50.854]  Big Brother.
[02:00:08.243 --> 02:00:10.004]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:10.004 --> 02:00:11.764]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.764 --> 02:00:13.345]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.345 --> 02:00:14.285]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.285 --> 02:00:19.106]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.106 --> 02:00:26.908]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.908 --> 02:00:35.471]  Thirty-three minutes from now, Robert Wannick will be joining us, persecuted in the USS... ARB.
[02:00:36.903 --> 02:00:38.503]  That the United States has turned into.
[02:00:38.503 --> 02:00:45.566]  Or the U.S.S.A.
[02:00:45.566 --> 02:00:49.227]  And then we have the lead singer of the rock band Iced Earth.
[02:00:49.227 --> 02:00:51.067]  They've been around for a long time.
[02:00:51.067 --> 02:00:52.468]  Very popular.
[02:00:52.468 --> 02:00:55.608]  They're on a whole bunch of charts globally, continually over the years.
[02:00:55.608 --> 02:00:59.910]  So it's a top rock band, if you haven't heard of them.
[02:00:59.910 --> 02:01:04.211]  The issue is they're putting out a completely free album and they're launching it today on this show.
[02:01:05.618 --> 02:01:08.379]  And this is a platinum band.
[02:01:08.379 --> 02:01:10.679]  So, again, they're getting into the fight.
[02:01:10.679 --> 02:01:15.940]  And that's why I just pointed out, my films are all free!
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:16.560]  Same thing.
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:21.401]  You want to beat tyranny, you gotta give something.
[02:01:21.401 --> 02:01:24.682]  And I want to salute iStirrth for what they're doing.
[02:01:24.682 --> 02:01:29.623]  Now look, we're able to fund our operation off DVD sales, radio advertisers,
[02:01:34.603 --> 02:01:44.434]  And sometimes it gets tough, but when you order the DVDs, the books, the materials, that is basically a donation.
[02:01:44.434 --> 02:01:47.577]  We're not tax-exempt, though, because we're not under the globalist's control.
[02:01:47.577 --> 02:01:52.343]  We'd be under government control if we did that, since they've taken over the charities and the churches.
[02:01:52.343 --> 02:01:55.186]  It's totally unconstitutional, but I wish we were tax-exempt.
[02:01:56.038 --> 02:02:00.080]  I could probably do it if I wanted to, but then that would bring them into my lives and I don't want to mess with it.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:09.283]  The point here is that when you purchase the books and videos and materials on the sites, that's how you fund our operation.
[02:02:09.283 --> 02:02:15.285]  And it's almost pearls before swine with some people.
[02:02:15.285 --> 02:02:22.248]  Cast not your pearls before swine, at least they turn on you and rend you or tear your guts out.
[02:02:23.916 --> 02:02:26.358]  You know, I say, oh, here's a $200,000 film I made.
[02:02:26.358 --> 02:02:31.002]  You know, I didn't go out and buy two Bentleys with this.
[02:02:31.002 --> 02:02:34.725]  I made the film, and it's free.
[02:02:34.725 --> 02:02:36.987]  People go, eh, so what?
[02:02:36.987 --> 02:02:47.995]  I mean, people on airplanes, interviews, 18-hour days, bloodshot eyes, composing the music, all the work that went into this with my team, and we say, here it is, it's free.
[02:02:47.995 --> 02:02:52.919]  And people tend to not appreciate something unless they pay for it.
[02:02:52.919 --> 02:02:53.380]  It's weird.
[02:02:54.844 --> 02:02:58.285]  So I hope you appreciate what Ice Earth has done.
[02:02:58.285 --> 02:03:01.745]  Guaranteed losing millions of dollars giving you this for free.
[02:03:01.745 --> 02:03:04.226]  And I hope you appreciate what we do here.
[02:03:04.226 --> 02:03:13.888]  Because I happen to know smaller filmmakers than I that make more money because they don't let people duplicate their films and they don't let people have them on the web.
[02:03:13.888 --> 02:03:15.548]  And you do end up selling more.
[02:03:15.548 --> 02:03:18.869]  It reaches one one-hundredth of what you would have reached.
[02:03:18.869 --> 02:03:20.049]  See, I want mines.
[02:03:21.325 --> 02:03:24.247]  The globalists want minds for their evil aims.
[02:03:24.247 --> 02:03:29.612]  I want minds because I'm into freedom and liberty, and I get excited about the dynamic human spirit.
[02:03:29.612 --> 02:03:33.115]  And I get excited about my species and our future.
[02:03:33.115 --> 02:03:34.956]  And I don't want the bad karma.
[02:03:34.956 --> 02:03:37.578]  I don't believe in the karma itself, but I like the term.
[02:03:37.578 --> 02:03:38.999]  It's really reap what you sow.
[02:03:38.999 --> 02:03:41.942]  The average person doesn't know what that means now, but they know what karma is.
[02:03:41.942 --> 02:03:43.083]  It's just been made popular.
[02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:47.648]  So remember, I'm always kind of reaching out to some of the lowest common denominator.
[02:03:47.648 --> 02:03:51.493]  I know we have listeners that are a lot smarter than I am, but there's some people that don't get it.
[02:03:51.493 --> 02:03:53.736]  I don't want to do bad things.
[02:03:53.736 --> 02:03:58.543]  Not just because I'm scared of the universe coming back at me, but because I enjoy doing good.
[02:04:01.621 --> 02:04:06.263]  I don't feel good when I help a little old lady across the street because I'm into being a goody two-shoes.
[02:04:06.263 --> 02:04:10.545]  At a fundamental level, helping people is what I like to do.
[02:04:10.545 --> 02:04:14.106]  At a fundamental level, I also want to knock the teeth out of bad people.
[02:04:14.106 --> 02:04:16.347]  That's normal, folks.
[02:04:16.347 --> 02:04:18.048]  And we need to get back to being normal.
[02:04:18.048 --> 02:04:21.050]  We've become abnormal.
[02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:24.391]  I'd have fit in real good three or four thousand years ago, folks.
[02:04:24.391 --> 02:04:28.873]  You know, living in some Nordic tribe somewhere.
[02:04:30.831 --> 02:04:33.673]  Just normal behavior.
[02:04:33.673 --> 02:04:37.076]  That's why people like dogs so much, because they're so similar to primitive man.
[02:04:37.076 --> 02:04:39.278]  They just... It's just, it's all straight up.
[02:04:39.278 --> 02:04:40.779]  You know what you got with a dog?
[02:04:40.779 --> 02:04:46.963]  Not these neurotic, twisted, gibbering, lying, demon creatures that we call human beings.
[02:04:46.963 --> 02:04:49.545]  We have got to stand up against the New World Order.
[02:04:49.545 --> 02:04:59.853]  So please, support us, and since the films are free online, get the URLs for the free films, and email it out to everybody you know.
[02:04:59.853 --> 02:05:00.494]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:02.759 --> 02:05:05.780]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:11.103]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:11.103 --> 02:05:13.163]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:13.163 --> 02:05:18.166]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:18.166 --> 02:05:19.346]  How much do you want?
[02:05:19.346 --> 02:05:20.467]  When do you want it?
[02:05:20.467 --> 02:05:22.347]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:22.347 --> 02:05:23.428]  When will you need it?
[02:05:23.428 --> 02:05:25.629]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:26.969]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:26.969 --> 02:05:28.270]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:33.755]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:33.755 --> 02:05:37.339]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:37.339 --> 02:05:41.163]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:41.163 --> 02:05:42.384]  How much will you need?
[02:05:42.384 --> 02:05:43.285]  We don't know.
[02:05:43.285 --> 02:05:44.386]  How much do you want?
[02:05:44.386 --> 02:05:45.147]  All you can get.
[02:05:45.147 --> 02:05:46.128]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:46.408 --> 02:05:49.451]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:49.451 --> 02:05:51.232]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:51.232 --> 02:05:52.153]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:01.775 --> 02:06:07.082]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:06:07.082 --> 02:06:11.628]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:06:11.628 --> 02:06:13.911]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:06:13.911 --> 02:06:15.533]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:06:15.533 --> 02:06:16.555]  There is a solution.
[02:06:16.775 --> 02:06:25.217]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:07:01.749 --> 02:07:05.851]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:08.733]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:08.733 --> 02:07:10.814]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:07:10.814 --> 02:07:13.055]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:07:13.055 --> 02:07:14.716]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:07:14.716 --> 02:07:19.018]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:07:54.357 --> 02:08:02.882]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:08:02.882 --> 02:08:08.366]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.967 --> 02:08:31.733]  We are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and live in color for all the radio listeners that wish to tune in on the web, not just to audio, but to the live video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:31.733 --> 02:08:35.394]  Coming up, health care bill wouldn't bring real reform.
[02:08:35.394 --> 02:08:46.098]  Howard Dean says he's getting ready to get somebody to run against Obama in 2012 because he knows Obama is going to be out of there.
[02:08:46.098 --> 02:08:47.319]  This is the third
[02:08:50.464 --> 02:08:53.626]  Administration of George W. Bush.
[02:08:53.626 --> 02:08:56.187]  Obama is a colossal hoax.
[02:08:56.187 --> 02:08:58.988]  He's as big a hoax as man-made global warming.
[02:08:58.988 --> 02:09:01.830]  He's as big a hoax as WMDs in Iraq.
[02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:04.491]  This isn't about partisanship, left or right.
[02:09:04.491 --> 02:09:05.672]  It's about the truth.
[02:09:05.672 --> 02:09:19.879]  And if you're a socialist who really wants government health care, you're a well-meaning liberal that wants to help people that don't have health care, you have to be against this bill.
[02:09:21.124 --> 02:09:25.551]  Because it's, as Dennis Kucinich said, it is nothing but a corporate ripoff.
[02:09:25.551 --> 02:09:28.215]  It raises your taxes and cuts your benefits.
[02:09:28.215 --> 02:09:29.177]  And it puts you in prison.
[02:09:31.115 --> 02:09:33.737]  I mean, it's so un-American, it makes my head spin.
[02:09:33.737 --> 02:09:35.298]  So unconstitutional.
[02:09:35.298 --> 02:09:45.827]  Now, I'm against free healthcare, because there's nothing that's free in this world, and it gives government control over your life, and any big government system turns into a rip-off.
[02:09:45.827 --> 02:09:51.572]  Because only big, powerful financial interests can come in and move the levers of government.
[02:09:51.572 --> 02:09:56.676]  So, any big government is always going to burn you, and is always going to be a fraud.
[02:09:56.676 --> 02:09:58.497]  That is the nature of it.
[02:09:58.497 --> 02:10:00.339]  It is like a law of gravity.
[02:10:01.019 --> 02:10:03.201]  Or the law of thermodynamics?
[02:10:03.201 --> 02:10:05.002]  Or the law of cause and effect?
[02:10:05.002 --> 02:10:07.504]  It is a law!
[02:10:07.504 --> 02:10:08.865]  Not a theory!
[02:10:08.865 --> 02:10:11.907]  Big government is hell!
[02:10:11.907 --> 02:10:13.268]  People want solutions?
[02:10:13.268 --> 02:10:14.609]  Cut government!
[02:10:14.609 --> 02:10:22.815]  Instead, Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[02:10:22.815 --> 02:10:24.937]  Now, the buck doesn't stop with Obama.
[02:10:24.937 --> 02:10:29.120]  I've told people, in Obama deception and fall of the republic, he will be politically destroyed.
[02:10:30.199 --> 02:10:32.040]  And then everything will be blamed on him.
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:36.003]  And then the next puppet will come in, and everything will be blamed on that puppet.
[02:10:36.003 --> 02:10:42.267]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, look past the little puppets dancing in front of you to the person pulling the strings.
[02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:43.708]  Bernanke.
[02:10:43.708 --> 02:10:44.988]  Summers.
[02:10:44.988 --> 02:10:46.349]  Geithner.
[02:10:46.349 --> 02:10:48.270]  Rubin.
[02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:49.191]  The Rothschilds.
[02:10:49.191 --> 02:10:51.092]  The Rockefellers.
[02:10:51.092 --> 02:10:53.614]  And finally, the real elite is being revealed.
[02:10:53.614 --> 02:10:56.916]  Now, in Copenhagen,
[02:11:00.396 --> 02:11:14.742]  The meeting is in trouble because Africa, Asia, and Latin America have discovered that it's massive taxes paid directly to the IMF and World Bank from the Third World and the First World, the developing and the developed, to be paid to the IMF and World Bank.
[02:11:14.742 --> 02:11:16.262]  The UN has no control.
[02:11:16.262 --> 02:11:21.865]  Even if you trust the UN, it's going to the IMF and World Bank, who are even worse.
[02:11:21.865 --> 02:11:23.165]  They're the progenitors of the UN.
[02:11:23.165 --> 02:11:28.487]  It's nothing but a holding front for them.
[02:11:28.487 --> 02:11:29.988]  George Soros is involved.
[02:11:31.761 --> 02:11:33.543]  Global taxes.
[02:11:33.543 --> 02:11:35.265]  Global GDP taxes.
[02:11:35.265 --> 02:11:38.688]  Global taxes with a global authority over all money transfers.
[02:11:38.688 --> 02:11:40.129]  That's what's in the treaty.
[02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:41.611]  Go to Infowars.com.
[02:11:41.611 --> 02:11:43.513]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:43.513 --> 02:11:45.575]  Go over the documents.
[02:11:45.575 --> 02:11:47.517]  Go over the latest treaty.
[02:11:47.517 --> 02:11:49.179]  Paul Watson's written an article about it.
[02:11:49.179 --> 02:11:50.360]  He has links to the treaty.
[02:11:53.516 --> 02:11:54.737]  Don't believe me.
[02:11:54.737 --> 02:11:55.978]  Read this for yourself.
[02:11:55.978 --> 02:12:22.178]  Then when you see Obama up there talking about how war is peace and how this is a great deal for the third world and how America's bad and has to pay its debt, that's meant to sell the left and America bashers on, oh, we're going to get behind this when it's actually genocide to their countries and is actually meant to target them and destroy the development of their industrial capacity.
[02:12:23.345 --> 02:12:26.106]  And as a death sentence, just the U.S.
[02:12:26.106 --> 02:12:35.051]  and Brazil shifting to 30% of their cornfields to ethanol doubled world food prices and killed an extra 10 million people from starvation.
[02:12:35.051 --> 02:12:36.972]  Normally it's 15 mil.
[02:12:36.972 --> 02:12:38.292]  It was 25 mil.
[02:12:38.292 --> 02:12:39.833]  Those are conservative estimates.
[02:12:39.833 --> 02:12:42.034]  You think about 10 million people.
[02:12:42.034 --> 02:12:48.377]  I know Stalin said that one person's a tragedy, 10,000's a statistic, but you wrap your mind around that.
[02:12:48.377 --> 02:12:49.338]  You let that sink in.
[02:12:51.001 --> 02:12:59.729]  Now in this segment and the next few, I'm going to play Obama's speech today in Copenhagen, the final day of the official world government event.
[02:12:59.729 --> 02:13:09.098]  I mean, that's what Ban Ki-moon calls it, that's what Van Rompuy calls it, the head of the EU, head of the UN, Schwarzenegger calls it that, David Rothschild calls it that.
[02:13:09.098 --> 02:13:12.801]  No more denial, private world government.
[02:13:12.801 --> 02:13:16.825]  So I'm going to play Obama and briefly stop him and cover each lie.
[02:13:18.407 --> 02:13:20.849]  Here is Obama today in Copenhagen.
[02:13:20.849 --> 02:13:21.029]  Okay.
[02:13:49.249 --> 02:13:51.990]  Now, that's about 30 seconds of it, let's go over the lies.
[02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:59.734]  He says, all of you leaders are here, you all agree that climate change is a grave and deadly threat and is really happening.
[02:13:59.734 --> 02:14:00.855]  That's a complete fraud.
[02:14:00.855 --> 02:14:14.222]  More than 50 of the delegates of the 190 plus that are there, on record have said they are questioning Climategate and the official story, and a bunch of world leaders from those countries are questioning it, and that's on record.
[02:14:15.384 --> 02:14:20.329]  You know, the President of the Czech Republic, countless others, the Russians, you name it.
[02:14:20.329 --> 02:14:22.851]  The Japanese, the Chinese, the Indians.
[02:14:22.851 --> 02:14:25.413]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[02:14:25.413 --> 02:14:26.194]  So that's a lie.
[02:14:26.194 --> 02:14:29.978]  You're all here, you all agree, and you all agree it's a grave danger.
[02:14:29.978 --> 02:14:34.422]  And notice it's not global warming now, because things are getting colder, naturally.
[02:14:34.422 --> 02:14:36.744]  It's global change.
[02:14:36.744 --> 02:14:38.286]  Change is not normal.
[02:14:38.286 --> 02:14:39.487]  The seasons are not normal.
[02:14:41.195 --> 02:14:43.458]  Okay, so let's continue.
[02:14:43.458 --> 02:14:50.509]  Unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[02:14:50.509 --> 02:14:53.113]  This is not fiction.
[02:14:53.113 --> 02:14:54.475]  It is science.
[02:14:54.475 --> 02:14:54.876]  Hit pause.
[02:14:56.479 --> 02:15:11.469]  This is not fiction, it is science, when the main UN university in England that produced the key documents and the head scientist for the IPCC, Santer, separately from ClimateGate, now admits, as of Wednesday on national US television,
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:20.424]  This is huge news that he took out five areas of the report where the UN's own scientists said man is not causing this.
[02:15:20.424 --> 02:15:22.725]  The final report, they cut it out.
[02:15:22.725 --> 02:15:29.008]  Of course man can't do anything near the sun or anything near the moon.
[02:15:29.008 --> 02:15:32.630]  And the tidal changes from the moon?
[02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:35.632]  The amount of gases exchanged by all of that water moving?
[02:15:35.632 --> 02:15:39.634]  I mean, that alone, the moon is unbelievable.
[02:15:39.634 --> 02:15:40.794]  But the sun dwarfs it.
[02:15:46.092 --> 02:15:47.032]  It's just incredible.
[02:15:47.032 --> 02:15:49.133]  All of it is lies.
[02:15:49.133 --> 02:15:49.993]  Continue.
[02:15:49.993 --> 02:15:51.414]  Unchecked.
[02:15:51.414 --> 02:16:00.317]  Climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet.
[02:16:00.317 --> 02:16:05.718]  Hit pause.
[02:16:05.718 --> 02:16:07.659]  Unacceptable risk.
[02:16:07.659 --> 02:16:10.940]  You have the UN caught fixing the data.
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:17.023]  This is the same thing when he talks about this is not a fiction, this is science.
[02:16:17.023 --> 02:16:21.625]  That's like Al Gore talking about how he invented the internet.
[02:16:21.625 --> 02:16:22.546]  Total lie.
[02:16:22.546 --> 02:16:27.949]  Or Al Gore saying polar bears can't swim and are all dying when their numbers have more than tripled in the last 50 years.
[02:16:27.949 --> 02:16:30.691]  Official numbers.
[02:16:30.691 --> 02:16:35.734]  That's like Bill Clinton saying, I did not have sex with that woman.
[02:16:35.734 --> 02:16:38.856]  Or Richard Nixon saying, I'm not a crook.
[02:16:38.856 --> 02:16:39.996]  Or George Bush Sr.
[02:16:39.996 --> 02:16:41.037]  saying, read my lips.
[02:16:42.034 --> 02:16:44.196]  It's a lie!
[02:16:44.196 --> 02:16:47.479]  It's a lie!
[02:16:47.479 --> 02:16:57.468]  So he's saying this is science, this is fact, you can't question when their scientists have been proven in premeditated fraud.
[02:16:57.468 --> 02:17:06.336]  Here's a guy saying pay taxes to a private global corporation, the World Bank and IMF, or the seas are going to rise and you're going to drown.
[02:17:06.336 --> 02:17:07.537]  Back to it.
[02:17:07.537 --> 02:17:08.218]  This much we know.
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:15.606]  The question then before us is no longer the nature of the challenge.
[02:17:17.264 --> 02:17:19.665]  The question is our capacity to meet it.
[02:17:19.665 --> 02:17:20.685]  Head pause.
[02:17:20.685 --> 02:17:23.325]  See, he just keeps saying, everyone knows, everyone knows.
[02:17:23.325 --> 02:17:24.586]  It's not a question.
[02:17:24.586 --> 02:17:25.586]  It's a fact.
[02:17:25.586 --> 02:17:27.086]  We know the facts are in.
[02:17:27.086 --> 02:17:28.327]  You've got to do what I say.
[02:17:28.327 --> 02:17:29.007]  It's a fact.
[02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:29.647]  It's a fact.
[02:17:29.647 --> 02:17:30.507]  It's a fact.
[02:17:30.507 --> 02:17:38.249]  A total con man, just a slick Harvard lawyer con man, running a scam on the dumb public.
[02:17:38.249 --> 02:17:40.450]  Well, the dumb public woke up to your scam, buddy.
[02:17:40.450 --> 02:17:42.410]  Let's go back to him.
[02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:46.011]  For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt,
[02:17:47.867 --> 02:17:49.047]  I have to be honest.
[02:17:49.047 --> 02:17:50.248]  There you go, hit pause again.
[02:17:50.248 --> 02:17:52.949]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm trying to play this.
[02:17:52.949 --> 02:17:55.890]  We're not even two minutes into it.
[02:17:55.890 --> 02:17:59.992]  He says, while the reality of climate change is not in doubt.
[02:17:59.992 --> 02:18:02.973]  I guess in a lawyer's speak, that's true.
[02:18:02.973 --> 02:18:04.653]  The climate is always changing.
[02:18:04.653 --> 02:18:09.595]  Just like on Mars, the ice caps were getting smaller the last 50 years.
[02:18:09.595 --> 02:18:11.916]  Suddenly, the last five, it started getting bigger again.
[02:18:13.895 --> 02:18:15.976]  Because the sun just cooled off.
[02:18:15.976 --> 02:18:17.717]  That's why it's going to get colder here.
[02:18:17.717 --> 02:18:27.163]  I mean, it's not a conspiracy theory, folks, that if you stand in front of a fireplace, it heats your hands and that the sun heats up and cools off.
[02:18:27.163 --> 02:18:30.445]  It oscillates in cycles, in 21-year cycles and 11-year cycles.
[02:18:34.028 --> 02:18:38.813]  I mean, ancients worshipped the sun because they knew it created the heat.
[02:18:38.813 --> 02:18:40.796]  The UN said on Monday, no, it's not the sun.
[02:18:40.796 --> 02:18:43.218]  The sun has no effect!
[02:18:43.218 --> 02:18:44.700]  That's Associated Press headline.
[02:18:46.578 --> 02:18:47.478]  In fact, Google that.
[02:18:47.478 --> 02:18:49.599]  UN says sun has no effect on climate.
[02:18:49.599 --> 02:18:53.021]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, penguins can swim.
[02:18:53.021 --> 02:18:54.262]  Their numbers are up.
[02:18:54.262 --> 02:18:55.362]  Polar bears can swim.
[02:18:55.362 --> 02:18:56.383]  They hunt on the ice flows.
[02:18:56.383 --> 02:18:57.403]  They're not grounding.
[02:18:57.403 --> 02:18:59.224]  The sun is what mainly drives climate.
[02:18:59.224 --> 02:19:12.651]  I don't know how many climatologists and astrophysicists I've got to have on to explain that, but when somebody tells you the sun isn't involved in the temperature, ladies and gentlemen, this planet would be below zero
[02:19:13.923 --> 02:19:21.208]  And would be hundreds of degrees below zero in days if the sun went out.
[02:19:21.208 --> 02:19:23.650]  We would be as cold as Pluto.
[02:19:23.650 --> 02:19:31.375]  Pluto, I forget, is... Pull up the temperature of Pluto, it's something like thousands of degrees below zero.
[02:19:31.375 --> 02:19:32.316]  You know why?
[02:19:32.316 --> 02:19:36.399]  Because it's thousands of times further out from the sun than our planet is.
[02:19:39.226 --> 02:19:43.230]  Look at that, no sun leak to climate change, BBC.
[02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:45.612]  How dumb do they think we are?
[02:19:45.612 --> 02:19:52.999]  I'm going to come back and try to go through this, but he said nobody's questioning, nobody's, no one's questioning climate change.
[02:19:52.999 --> 02:19:53.900]  You heard it from him.
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:54.961]  That's another lie.
[02:19:54.961 --> 02:19:59.826]  31,000 scientists sent him a petition saying they wanted to talk to him.
[02:20:03.038 --> 02:20:03.939]  We're good to go.
[02:20:22.182 --> 02:20:22.622]  I think so.
[02:20:45.543 --> 02:20:45.903]  I think.
[02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:10.383]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, or congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[02:21:10.383 --> 02:21:16.486]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:16.486 --> 02:21:19.447]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:21:19.447 --> 02:21:21.808]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do
[02:21:21.988 --> 02:21:22.268]  We're good.
[02:21:37.472 --> 02:21:39.234]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:39.234 --> 02:21:41.756]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:41.756 --> 02:21:46.480]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:50.203]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:21:50.203 --> 02:21:53.325]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:53.325 --> 02:21:55.227]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:55.227 --> 02:21:57.348]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:22:02.202 --> 02:22:06.327]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[02:22:06.327 --> 02:22:10.593]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:22:10.593 --> 02:22:12.175]  You get less for your money.
[02:22:12.175 --> 02:22:18.023]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:18.523]  I think so.
[02:22:44.275 --> 02:22:44.575]  We're good.
[02:23:02.318 --> 02:23:05.840]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:08.122]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:08.122 --> 02:23:09.002]  Don't!
[02:23:09.002 --> 02:23:12.444]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:12.444 --> 02:23:19.568]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:23:19.548 --> 02:23:21.530]  's number one debt secret.
[02:23:21.530 --> 02:23:25.192]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:25.592 --> 02:23:28.733]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:36.114]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:36.114 --> 02:23:37.294]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:37.294 --> 02:23:40.475]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:40.475 --> 02:23:41.835]  What have you got to lose?
[02:23:41.835 --> 02:23:45.536]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:23:45.536 --> 02:23:49.476]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:23:49.476 --> 02:23:49.836]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:23:53.917 --> 02:23:54.277]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:23:54.277 --> 02:23:54.317]  888-352-7726.
[02:24:18.914 --> 02:24:21.396]  Okay, let's continue with Obama.
[02:24:21.396 --> 02:24:24.818]  So he just said, no one questions climate change.
[02:24:24.818 --> 02:24:25.659]  Another lie.
[02:24:25.659 --> 02:24:27.300]  I mean, you know that's a lie.
[02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:33.324]  Even if you believe polar bears can't swim, penguins can't swim, the sun doesn't warm the earth, has nothing to do with it.
[02:24:33.324 --> 02:24:37.167]  You just saw the UN say so.
[02:24:37.167 --> 02:24:42.510]  You could fry eggs outside on the cement in July in Texas, but nothing to do with the sun.
[02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:45.793]  That heat's coming up from a grill underneath the concrete.
[02:24:45.793 --> 02:24:47.274]  Okay, even if you believe that,
[02:24:48.516 --> 02:24:52.897]  You know scientists are questioning man-made global warming.
[02:24:52.897 --> 02:24:54.358]  You know that's a lie.
[02:24:54.358 --> 02:24:55.798]  Now let's go back to his lordship.
[02:24:55.798 --> 02:24:57.619]  Here's Obama at the UN.
[02:24:57.619 --> 02:25:00.400]  ...is not in doubt.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:11.743]  I have to be honest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now.
[02:25:11.743 --> 02:25:15.784]  And it hangs in the balance.
[02:25:15.784 --> 02:25:17.245]  I believe we can act boldly,
[02:25:18.379 --> 02:25:24.464]  And decisively, in the face of a common threat.
[02:25:24.464 --> 02:25:36.093]  That's why I come here today, not to talk, but to act.
[02:25:36.093 --> 02:25:44.259]  Now, as the world's largest economy, and as the world's second largest emitter,
[02:25:46.147 --> 02:25:48.672]  America bears our responsibility.
[02:25:50.785 --> 02:25:54.368]  Okay, so now there's a bunch of America bashing.
[02:25:54.368 --> 02:25:56.029]  We're the second biggest polluter.
[02:25:56.029 --> 02:26:01.454]  China's passed us last year of putting out the most carbon dioxide.
[02:26:01.454 --> 02:26:09.161]  Let's not stop them for putting lead, mercury and melamine in the baby milk and in the medicines and the foods and all the crud they ship over here.
[02:26:09.161 --> 02:26:11.343]  Let's not have China stop that.
[02:26:11.343 --> 02:26:13.244]  Let's have them stop putting out carbon dioxide.
[02:26:13.244 --> 02:26:16.307]  But wait, they don't have to make cuts under this agreement.
[02:26:16.307 --> 02:26:16.967]  Only we do.
[02:26:17.924 --> 02:26:21.927]  And so more of our industry will move there.
[02:26:21.927 --> 02:26:27.312]  But here he is, in front of the UN, in front of all these countries, bad-mouthing his own country.
[02:26:27.312 --> 02:26:29.633]  Back to Obama.
[02:26:29.633 --> 02:26:36.239]  America bears our responsibility to address climate change.
[02:26:36.239 --> 02:26:40.262]  And we intend to meet that responsibility.
[02:26:40.262 --> 02:26:46.027]  That's why we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations.
[02:26:47.113 --> 02:26:51.563]  That's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.
[02:26:51.563 --> 02:26:52.164]  Alright, hit pause.
[02:26:53.206 --> 02:26:56.227]  What that means is, hey, the U.S.
[02:26:56.227 --> 02:26:58.788]  is run by the private banks, and the U.S.
[02:26:58.788 --> 02:27:00.188]  has funded the world government.
[02:27:00.188 --> 02:27:07.030]  We've been sucked dry to fund this, and we're intensifying our funding to buy all you third world countries off.
[02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:15.252]  And most of you presidents and prime ministers and parliament heads, you've all gotten giant cash payments from us to sell your people out.
[02:27:15.252 --> 02:27:17.833]  So you've been bought, so you deliver.
[02:27:18.633 --> 02:27:27.559]  You deliver cutting off the resources and fossil fuels to your millions of people, many of which are living on the edge of starvation, and millions of which do starve.
[02:27:27.559 --> 02:27:34.424]  You kill your people for the New World Order because that's what Dutch Rochelle and the Queen of England and David Rockefeller want.
[02:27:34.424 --> 02:27:35.965]  That's the translation there.
[02:27:35.965 --> 02:27:37.646]  Back to Obama.
[02:27:37.646 --> 02:27:45.112]  That's why we've taken bold action at home by making historic investments in renewable energy, by putting our people to work
[02:27:46.081 --> 02:27:48.143]  Increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings.
[02:27:48.143 --> 02:27:49.124]  All right, head pause.
[02:27:49.124 --> 02:27:49.885]  More lies.
[02:27:49.885 --> 02:27:55.911]  They always candy coat their global taxation grid in electric cars, windmills, things that sound reasonable.
[02:27:55.911 --> 02:28:00.176]  But really, even those are boondoggles given to their select friends and buddies as payoffs.
[02:28:00.176 --> 02:28:01.517]  That's coming out in the news.
[02:28:01.517 --> 02:28:02.778]  So that's an inside scam.
[02:28:03.699 --> 02:28:23.493]  And then they use all that fake environmentalism to block out real environmental action, real environmental controls, like genetic engineering and things that are truly dangerous, nanotech, CERN reactors, superconducting super colliders, a lot of these super advanced technologies the Pentagon admits they're messing around with antimatter.
[02:28:23.493 --> 02:28:25.314]  That's in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:28:25.314 --> 02:28:29.177]  Oh, let's not have any real controls on stuff that really is dangerous!
[02:28:30.848 --> 02:28:32.509]  Let's just, hey, you're for the future.
[02:28:32.509 --> 02:28:34.050]  You're for renewable energy.
[02:28:34.050 --> 02:28:35.471]  You know, you care, don't you?
[02:28:35.471 --> 02:28:37.372]  We're going to go out to break with Obama.
[02:28:37.372 --> 02:28:41.294]  I'm going to come back and comment on what he had to say and finish up on the other side.
[02:28:41.294 --> 02:28:41.955]  Stay with us.
[02:28:41.955 --> 02:28:42.996]  Back to Obama.
[02:28:42.996 --> 02:28:51.061]  By pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy.
[02:28:51.061 --> 02:28:58.665]  These mitigation actions are ambitious and we are taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities.
[02:28:58.665 --> 02:28:59.506]  We are convinced
[02:29:00.655 --> 02:29:11.477]  As some of you may be convinced, that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future.
[02:29:11.477 --> 02:29:20.579]  That it will create millions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation.
[02:29:20.579 --> 02:29:28.100]  We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a more efficient fashion,
[02:29:29.053 --> 02:29:37.741]  is essential to our national security, because it helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
[02:29:37.741 --> 02:29:43.085]  It helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climate change.
[02:29:43.085 --> 02:29:53.034]  So I want this plenary session to understand, America is going to continue on this course of action.
[02:29:53.034 --> 02:29:55.937]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.933 --> 02:29:59.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.199 --> 02:30:06.741]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:06.741 --> 02:30:07.662]  Number 1.
[02:30:07.662 --> 02:30:11.084]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:11.084 --> 02:30:11.944]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.944 --> 02:30:16.827]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.827 --> 02:30:17.567]  It's true.
[02:30:17.567 --> 02:30:22.450]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:22.450 --> 02:30:23.270]  Number 3.
[02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:26.852]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.852 --> 02:30:30.574]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.754 --> 02:30:31.555]  Number 4.
[02:30:31.555 --> 02:30:34.317]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:34.317 --> 02:30:38.001]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:38.001 --> 02:30:38.802]  Number 5.
[02:30:38.802 --> 02:30:42.945]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.945 --> 02:30:47.710]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:52.153]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.153 --> 02:30:53.934]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:53.934 --> 02:30:56.196]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:56.196 --> 02:30:58.538]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:03.834 --> 02:31:07.795]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:07.795 --> 02:31:16.656]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:16.656 --> 02:31:21.277]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:21.277 --> 02:31:32.099]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:32.739 --> 02:31:42.242]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:42.242 --> 02:31:47.683]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:47.683 --> 02:31:55.165]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:55.165 --> 02:31:57.926]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:03.095 --> 02:32:07.096]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:07.096 --> 02:32:10.337]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:10.337 --> 02:32:15.138]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:15.138 --> 02:32:21.540]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:23.781]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:25.501]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:32:25.501 --> 02:32:26.462]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:26.462 --> 02:32:28.582]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:43.206 --> 02:32:43.666]  So now Obama
[02:33:10.424 --> 02:33:16.649]  Word for word says what Lord Christopher Monckton yesterday on this radio show said he would say.
[02:33:16.649 --> 02:33:17.951]  Word for word.
[02:33:17.951 --> 02:33:22.875]  When I watched this live early this morning, my mouth was hanging open.
[02:33:22.875 --> 02:33:24.797]  I mean, word for word.
[02:33:24.797 --> 02:33:25.837]  We must do this.
[02:33:25.837 --> 02:33:27.379]  It's a historic global agreement.
[02:33:27.379 --> 02:33:28.240]  You're part of this.
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:30.061]  Your children are watching.
[02:33:30.061 --> 02:33:31.322]  You've got to do this.
[02:33:31.322 --> 02:33:34.165]  We've had all these years of inaction, which isn't true.
[02:33:34.685 --> 02:33:42.831]  They're taking over the counties and cities through the bureaucracies of all the nations, including the United States especially.
[02:33:42.831 --> 02:33:47.695]  All the different sub-regions, depending on how governments break that down in their federal systems.
[02:33:47.695 --> 02:33:49.896]  They are already implementing all this.
[02:33:49.896 --> 02:33:52.158]  You know about all the green taxes you're already paying?
[02:33:52.158 --> 02:33:52.938]  None of it's green.
[02:33:52.938 --> 02:33:53.639]  It's a robbery.
[02:33:54.659 --> 02:33:58.721]  So let's go back to Obama as he says, we've got to do this.
[02:33:58.721 --> 02:34:01.523]  It's historical.
[02:34:01.523 --> 02:34:04.785]  And then he goes on to say, even if you don't sign on, the U.S.
[02:34:04.785 --> 02:34:06.486]  is going to fund this.
[02:34:06.486 --> 02:34:14.790]  And that will just be private money to the IMF to go into round two of paying off other countries that they've already got under debt.
[02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:17.812]  This is their new way to get even more debt and more control.
[02:34:17.812 --> 02:34:19.553]  Here's Obama.
[02:34:19.553 --> 02:34:23.195]  To mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy,
[02:34:24.738 --> 02:34:34.286]  No matter what happens here in Copenhagen, we think it is good for us as well as good for the world.
[02:34:34.286 --> 02:34:41.773]  But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we act together.
[02:34:43.410 --> 02:34:44.411]  So there you have it.
[02:34:44.411 --> 02:34:52.077]  They're gonna make the climate cuts here, which is even better for them in phase one, just like the big, famous steel mill that just closed in England.
[02:34:52.077 --> 02:34:54.660]  The government paid them millions of pounds, millions of U.S.
[02:34:54.660 --> 02:35:00.445]  dollars to shut down and move to India with no emissions controls.
[02:35:00.445 --> 02:35:02.066]  That's environmentalism.
[02:35:02.066 --> 02:35:10.633]  So even if you believe that polar bears can't swim and that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is a deadly poison, this is gonna produce more of that deadly poison.
[02:35:10.633 --> 02:35:10.974]  Here it is.
[02:35:12.062 --> 02:35:26.733]  That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree to certain steps and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments.
[02:35:26.733 --> 02:35:41.304]  After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings, bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion,
[02:35:42.426 --> 02:35:50.914]  Among negotiators, I believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear.
[02:35:50.914 --> 02:36:02.324]  First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions and begin to turn the corner on climate change.
[02:36:05.422 --> 02:36:17.379]  Even if you believe the UN's own Cook numbers, all of our evil carbon dioxide may increase the temperature by one degree and may make the seas rise between 7 and 20 inches.
[02:36:17.379 --> 02:36:17.659]  Nothing.
[02:36:18.413 --> 02:36:19.995]  And that's been proven to be a fraud.
[02:36:19.995 --> 02:36:30.805]  The seas are actually slightly dropping right now, and you can just go to any major coastal relay center online and read their 10-year numbers on the level.
[02:36:30.805 --> 02:36:37.891]  Last five years, San Francisco's water level has gone down by a few inches on average, but it goes up and down.
[02:36:37.891 --> 02:36:39.072]  The point here is
[02:36:40.208 --> 02:36:43.310]  I'm pleased that many of us have already done so.
[02:37:07.130 --> 02:37:15.172]  Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets, significant targets, ambitious targets.
[02:37:15.172 --> 02:37:23.334]  And I'm confident that America will fulfill the commitments that we have made, cutting our emissions in the range of 17% by 2020, and by more than 80% by 2050, in line with final legislation.
[02:37:31.465 --> 02:37:39.707]  We must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments and exchange this information in a transparent manner.
[02:37:39.707 --> 02:37:41.547]  Hit pause.
[02:37:41.547 --> 02:37:43.308]  That's the global government.
[02:37:43.308 --> 02:37:53.190]  Just like they attack your country if you try to build your own nuclear reactors, or if you try to have your own central bank, they will attack you over your carbon emissions.
[02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:57.171]  They will put sanctions on you and then, yes, physically attack you.
[02:37:58.305 --> 02:38:01.026]  These measures need not be intrusive or infringe upon sovereignty.
[02:38:01.026 --> 02:38:05.127]  They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible and that we're living up to our mutual obligations.
[02:38:05.127 --> 02:38:06.128]  Without such accountability,
[02:38:26.218 --> 02:38:30.901]  Any agreement would be empty words on a page.
[02:38:30.901 --> 02:38:40.025]  I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments.
[02:38:40.025 --> 02:38:41.446]  Hit pause.
[02:38:41.446 --> 02:38:44.728]  And that was a satellite blip from recording it.
[02:38:44.728 --> 02:38:46.068]  A TV blip from Denmark.
[02:38:46.068 --> 02:38:47.389]  We didn't edit anything.
[02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:49.510]  You can read the transcript for yourself.
[02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:53.993]  And there he's saying you've got to have a global institution to enforce this agreement.
[02:38:53.993 --> 02:38:54.453]  Back to it.
[02:38:57.912 --> 02:39:00.594]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:39:00.594 --> 02:39:04.677]  It would be a hollow victory.
[02:39:04.677 --> 02:39:17.545]  Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly the least developed and most vulnerable to climate change.
[02:39:17.545 --> 02:39:22.489]  America will be a part of a fast start funding that will ramp up
[02:39:24.171 --> 02:39:31.136]  Okay, stop right there.
[02:39:31.136 --> 02:39:34.278]  They say they're going to help the third world.
[02:39:34.278 --> 02:39:50.470]  All these are IMF World Bank loans backed up with Western tax money, and the loans are given, this was going on in 73 under State Department memorandum 200, where Kissinger's talking about, we give them loans to sterilize their women and to cut off food.
[02:39:50.470 --> 02:39:52.592]  And in the future, you won't get
[02:39:53.664 --> 02:39:57.226]  Loans unless you cut the amount of food you eat.
[02:39:57.226 --> 02:39:58.527]  This is eugenics.
[02:39:58.527 --> 02:40:01.648]  This is population reduction.
[02:40:01.648 --> 02:40:04.670]  Let's go back to the video.
[02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:14.896]  Hillary Clinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize $100 billion in financing by 2020.
[02:40:14.896 --> 02:40:21.759]  If, and only if, it is part of a broader accord that I've just described.
[02:40:21.759 --> 02:40:22.720]  Alright, pause again.
[02:40:25.086 --> 02:40:35.249]  What he's saying there is, I'll give $100 billion to the third world, but we'll do it in 2020, 10 years after we're taxing you for carbon.
[02:40:35.249 --> 02:40:39.130]  Do you understand what that means?
[02:40:39.130 --> 02:40:44.391]  Alright, let's go ahead now and go back to the clip.
[02:40:44.391 --> 02:40:51.033]  Mitigation, transparency, financing.
[02:40:51.033 --> 02:40:51.893]  It's a clear formula.
[02:40:53.234 --> 02:41:02.336]  One that embraces the principle of common but differentiated responses and respective capabilities.
[02:41:02.336 --> 02:41:05.077]  And it adds up to a significant accord.
[02:41:05.077 --> 02:41:12.919]  One that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as an international community.
[02:41:12.919 --> 02:41:19.260]  I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time.
[02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:28.654]  And at this point the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart.
[02:41:28.654 --> 02:41:34.596]  Whether we prefer posturing to action.
[02:41:34.596 --> 02:41:41.158]  I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I just described.
[02:41:41.158 --> 02:41:45.159]  No country will get what it wants.
[02:41:45.159 --> 02:41:51.081]  There are those developing countries that want aid with no strings attached.
[02:41:51.854 --> 02:41:53.014]  Okay, that's another lie.
[02:42:09.284 --> 02:42:11.925]  We've got the Copenhagen Treaty.
[02:42:11.925 --> 02:42:17.707]  They're upset because they were told they didn't have to make cuts and the first world did, that they were going to get tax money.
[02:42:17.707 --> 02:42:33.553]  Now they learn they have to make cuts almost double, it's not quite double, almost double what the West has to make and that the IMF and World Bank will be collecting all this money and keeping it for themselves and the third world knows how corrupt those institutions are.
[02:42:33.553 --> 02:42:38.855]  So here he is, like he's the arbiter between the first world and the third world and the developing world.
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:45.324]  You know, he's the arbiter when he clearly is a representative of the Anglo-American New World Order.
[02:42:45.324 --> 02:42:46.485]  Let's go back to him.
[02:42:46.485 --> 02:43:02.377]  Those advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance or that will not be held accountable effectively and that the world's fastest growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.
[02:43:02.377 --> 02:43:08.622]  We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years.
[02:43:12.897 --> 02:43:20.943]  Energy, cheap energy has allowed humans to grow and has lifted a lot of people out of poverty.
[02:43:20.943 --> 02:43:27.228]  He's now saying cutting people's energy off is cutting their bondage off.
[02:43:27.228 --> 02:43:37.176]  Meanwhile, governments actually try to block real technological development and in this treaty it says the UN will decide what new technologies can be funded and developed.
[02:43:37.176 --> 02:43:39.058]  So it's also a new dark age.
[02:43:39.058 --> 02:43:39.818]  Let's go back to it.
[02:43:42.810 --> 02:43:50.156]  These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades.
[02:43:50.156 --> 02:44:03.107]  And we have very little other than an increased acceleration of the climate change phenomena.
[02:44:03.107 --> 02:44:05.369]  The time for talk is over.
[02:44:07.435 --> 02:44:10.636]  This is the bottom line.
[02:44:10.636 --> 02:44:12.017]  The time for talk is over.
[02:44:12.017 --> 02:44:13.637]  You're not allowed to talk.
[02:44:13.637 --> 02:44:16.138]  You're not allowed to debate.
[02:44:16.138 --> 02:44:21.300]  Everyone agrees the Earth is dying from CO2, but everyone doesn't agree.
[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:24.901]  So if everybody agrees, why is the time for talk over?
[02:44:24.901 --> 02:44:30.083]  See, we have to hurry and do this right now, finishing up with Obama.
[02:44:30.083 --> 02:44:31.743]  This is the bottom line.
[02:44:31.743 --> 02:44:35.885]  We can embrace this accord, take a substantial step forward,
[02:44:36.772 --> 02:44:41.997]  Continue to refine it and build upon its foundation.
[02:44:41.997 --> 02:44:46.721]  We can do that and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor.
[02:44:46.721 --> 02:44:52.025]  One that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren.
[02:44:52.025 --> 02:44:55.908]  Or, we can choose delay.
[02:44:55.908 --> 02:44:56.609]  There you go.
[02:44:56.609 --> 02:44:57.090]  Hit pause.
[02:44:59.451 --> 02:45:01.473]  Two-year-old level psychology.
[02:45:01.473 --> 02:45:05.676]  You don't care about your children and grandchildren if you don't give in to this.
[02:45:05.676 --> 02:45:16.486]  When in truth, cutting off the fossil fuels of the third world, in their own Club of Rome documents, the State Department memorandum 200, is meant to kill people en masse by starvation.
[02:45:16.486 --> 02:45:19.468]  Which is how Mao Zedong did it, and how Stalin did it.
[02:45:19.468 --> 02:45:24.012]  This is a death sentence, and Obama knows full well what he's doing.
[02:45:24.012 --> 02:45:25.854]  That's why he's the brown face on this,
[02:45:26.454 --> 02:45:30.475]  ...hoping to sucker the third world into their own death sentence.
[02:45:30.475 --> 02:45:33.296]  That's why he was put in power, was to sell this.
[02:45:33.296 --> 02:45:36.617]  That's why he was given the Nobel Peace Prize, to sell war.
[02:45:36.617 --> 02:45:37.898]  That war is peace.
[02:45:37.898 --> 02:45:39.298]  Back to the fraud!
[02:45:39.298 --> 02:45:45.180]  ...falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years.
[02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:54.663]  And we will be back having the same stale arguments, month after month, year after year, perhaps decade after decade,
[02:45:56.039 --> 02:46:05.504]  All while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible.
[02:46:05.504 --> 02:46:08.945]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no time to waste.
[02:46:08.945 --> 02:46:11.166]  America's made our choice.
[02:46:11.166 --> 02:46:12.867]  We have charted our course.
[02:46:12.867 --> 02:46:14.368]  We have made our commitments.
[02:46:14.368 --> 02:46:17.089]  We will do what we say.
[02:46:17.089 --> 02:46:23.672]  Now I believe it's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a common purpose.
[02:46:23.672 --> 02:46:24.313]  Stop right there!
[02:46:25.376 --> 02:46:32.183]  That's why Obama has told the Senate and the House, I don't care if this doesn't get ratified.
[02:46:32.183 --> 02:46:34.745]  I'm going to implement this by command and control.
[02:46:34.745 --> 02:46:37.708]  Remember that on Monday from the White House?
[02:46:37.708 --> 02:46:39.210]  Totally unconstitutional.
[02:46:39.210 --> 02:46:40.991]  He's not a dictator.
[02:46:40.991 --> 02:46:43.073]  But that's why he said that.
[02:46:43.073 --> 02:46:44.375]  Obama said that.
[02:46:45.836 --> 02:46:50.058]  Because he's been given his orders, the die is set, the U.S.
[02:46:50.058 --> 02:46:52.119]  has to be the sacrificial lamb.
[02:46:52.119 --> 02:46:58.521]  China, India, Mexico, and a hundred plus other third world countries, they're not going to make any cuts.
[02:46:58.521 --> 02:46:59.161]  The U.S.
[02:46:59.161 --> 02:47:00.622]  is going to sign on to the agreement.
[02:47:01.964 --> 02:47:13.907]  Europe's going to sign on and we're going to have our taxes raised to give more money to the IMF and World Bank to go buy off the third world, the third world leaders, to murder their people by starvation.
[02:47:13.907 --> 02:47:15.087]  Real simple.
[02:47:15.087 --> 02:47:21.229]  And that's what's covered in Ecoscience, written by the White House science czar.
[02:47:21.229 --> 02:47:23.009]  That's their plan.
[02:47:23.009 --> 02:47:24.449]  They want to get rid of people.
[02:47:24.449 --> 02:47:30.331]  And there's a lot of you out there that think it's the received knowledge that we've got to reduce world population and that it's the right thing to do.
[02:47:31.854 --> 02:47:33.916]  Well, you go ahead and kill yourselves then.
[02:47:33.916 --> 02:47:44.526]  Do not sit there and have a death sentence to these little African children, and Latin Americans, and Asians, and others, and then see American standard of living dropped.
[02:47:44.526 --> 02:47:47.629]  There's tens of millions of Americans on subsistence right now.
[02:47:47.629 --> 02:47:51.233]  There's people that freeze to death every year in this country, having their power turned off.
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:59.643]  This is genocide for all you people that have been sold on this being cutesy and cute by the corporate media.
[02:47:59.643 --> 02:48:02.004]  You know the corporate media is death!
[02:48:02.004 --> 02:48:05.025]  What are you doing being sold by this?
[02:48:05.025 --> 02:48:05.585]  Wake up!
[02:48:05.585 --> 02:48:07.066]  Stop being schmucks!
[02:48:07.066 --> 02:48:09.227]  Stop being fools!
[02:48:09.227 --> 02:48:10.267]  Stop being idiots!
[02:48:10.267 --> 02:48:12.688]  Let's finish up with Obama, then I'm skipping this break.
[02:48:12.688 --> 02:48:13.708]  We're going to Robert Wannick.
[02:48:13.708 --> 02:48:15.409]  Go ahead.
[02:48:15.409 --> 02:48:18.911]  We are ready to get this done today.
[02:48:18.911 --> 02:48:20.351]  We're ready to gut America right now.
[02:48:20.351 --> 02:48:22.152]  There has to be movement on all sides.
[02:48:23.305 --> 02:48:30.070]  To recognize that it is better for us to act than to talk.
[02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:43.500]  It's better for us to choose action over inaction, the future over the past, and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meet our responsibilities to our people in the future of our planet.
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:46.402]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:46.402 --> 02:48:48.083]  I mean, what a load of bull.
[02:48:48.083 --> 02:48:50.525]  So that's my breakdown of his 10 minute, 40 minute, 10 minute, 40 second speech.
[02:48:55.001 --> 02:48:59.245]  And it just, I could talk for 10 hours about what he's discussing.
[02:48:59.245 --> 02:49:04.851]  I could spend an hour on each minute going through, showing the evidence of how it's all frauds.
[02:49:04.851 --> 02:49:09.996]  But why should I have to show evidence when they say the sun doesn't affect temperature on the earth?
[02:49:09.996 --> 02:49:14.280]  When they say penguins and polar bears can't swim and are all drowning?
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.944]  Or when they say the ice caps would be gone by this year, three years ago, and they're getting bigger?
[02:49:19.921 --> 02:49:22.803]  Or, and they say, any climate change is abnormal.
[02:49:22.803 --> 02:49:28.066]  It's nothing but scaremongering to accept world government run by a private banking system.
[02:49:28.066 --> 02:49:29.067]  Alright, I'm done ranting.
[02:49:29.067 --> 02:49:32.609]  We've only got 10 minutes with Robert Wannick, who's been persecuted.
[02:49:32.609 --> 02:49:39.374]  We'll be rolling video in the background without audio of his YouTube video where he describes this.
[02:49:39.374 --> 02:49:44.377]  Robert Wannick, great 9-11 truth activist, great patriot.
[02:49:44.377 --> 02:49:48.440]  He is in high school and
[02:49:49.204 --> 02:50:01.294]  He's won one of our postering contests before, and this time he got expelled for handing out the actual inserts that show you what's really in the flu vaccine.
[02:50:01.294 --> 02:50:06.498]  They admit there's mercury, it can cause Guillain-Barré, brain damage, neurological disorders, cancer.
[02:50:06.498 --> 02:50:08.220]  They don't want that being handed out.
[02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:14.025]  So he's trying to warn fellow students in his off time, at school, and this is what happened to him.
[02:50:14.025 --> 02:50:18.028]  Robert Wannick, tell us again where you're hailing from and exactly what happened to you.
[02:50:18.732 --> 02:50:21.452]  Well, thanks for bringing me on today, Alex.
[02:50:21.452 --> 02:50:24.353]  I attend school in Breckenridge, Minnesota.
[02:50:24.353 --> 02:50:32.595]  I attend Breckenridge High School, and every Wednesday we have a group meeting of classes called Connection.
[02:50:32.595 --> 02:50:39.376]  Last Wednesday we were given forms to receive our H1N1 vaccine on Wednesday the 16th.
[02:50:39.376 --> 02:50:46.137]  I decided it would be a great idea if I'd fill out one of these forms and attend the clinic to educate others of the possible risks.
[02:50:46.829 --> 02:50:52.432]  Which a school should actually promote self-education of students.
[02:50:52.432 --> 02:50:53.513]  No, you're a prisoner.
[02:50:53.513 --> 02:50:54.614]  You're not allowed to do that.
[02:50:54.614 --> 02:51:01.098]  You're to keep your mouth shut and only in super maxes are you not allowed to talk to the other prisoners.
[02:51:01.098 --> 02:51:02.819]  So you're in a super max.
[02:51:02.819 --> 02:51:04.440]  Exactly what's happening.
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:13.105]  So first step that was taken was my principal called my mom and asked her if she had signed this H1N1 form knowing that I'm
[02:51:13.661 --> 02:51:15.041]  Anti-vaccine.
[02:51:15.041 --> 02:51:24.284]  She said yes because she supports the education of other students who may not be aware of the risk.
[02:51:24.284 --> 02:51:29.005]  So they were already watching you and didn't know why you were agreeing to do it.
[02:51:29.005 --> 02:51:29.505]  Exactly.
[02:51:29.505 --> 02:51:31.786]  They were calling my parents.
[02:51:31.786 --> 02:51:33.246]  Well, that's what wardens do.
[02:51:33.246 --> 02:51:35.227]  You know, he's doing his job as a warden.
[02:51:35.227 --> 02:51:35.567]  Go ahead.
[02:51:37.247 --> 02:51:47.190]  So the 16th came this Wednesday and they were calling the juniors down to the science room to get vaccines from Wilkin County Public Health.
[02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:48.530]  They called my name.
[02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:55.432]  I went down there with about three file folders of information that simply had the inserts
[02:51:55.925 --> 02:51:56.405]  Absolutely.
[02:51:56.405 --> 02:51:58.725]  So, my principal was at the door and he said, Robert, you can go sit down.
[02:51:58.725 --> 02:52:00.446]  So I went and sat down next to a nurse.
[02:52:00.446 --> 02:52:05.727]  As soon as she told me to roll up my sleeve, I stood up and said, attention, I just want to hand out some information.
[02:52:25.265 --> 02:52:27.246]  About vaccine risk.
[02:52:27.246 --> 02:52:34.488]  I only got a few flyers out before my principal came up, rammed his hand into my lower back, and started forcing me towards the door.
[02:52:34.488 --> 02:52:36.348]  I said, don't touch me, I'm leaving.
[02:52:36.348 --> 02:52:38.909]  He said, I'm just escorting you out.
[02:52:38.909 --> 02:52:42.050]  I was out of the room within 30 seconds.
[02:52:42.050 --> 02:52:50.832]  But I decided that I couldn't go back to class yet if these kids had no clue what they were putting in their bodies, so I decided to address the line.
[02:52:51.499 --> 02:52:58.565]  So I handed out about 30 flyers, one to each kid in line, except for the science teacher's son, who refused one.
[02:52:58.565 --> 02:53:01.867]  And many of them started dispersing and leaving the line.
[02:53:01.867 --> 02:53:10.014]  Others just said, you know, I have a choice, and... I mean, this is real rebellion against tyranny, but the science teacher kid... I'm a scientist.
[02:53:10.014 --> 02:53:12.656]  I don't look at what's in the vaccine.
[02:53:12.656 --> 02:53:14.617]  Hmm.
[02:53:14.617 --> 02:53:16.318]  I trust my Soviet government.
[02:53:16.318 --> 02:53:16.699]  Go ahead.
[02:53:17.682 --> 02:53:24.248]  Yeah, and so these students started leaving and moments later I heard a student from inside the vaccine room say, I have a choice.
[02:53:24.248 --> 02:53:25.569]  I don't want it anymore.
[02:53:25.569 --> 02:53:26.811]  I'm not going to get it.
[02:53:26.811 --> 02:53:34.558]  So they didn't even know they had a choice because all over the country it's come out they are forcibly inoculating mainly elementary students because they don't know.
[02:53:35.267 --> 02:53:41.290]  And the funny part about it was the nurse actually tried to almost tell him that it was, um, it was mandatory.
[02:53:41.290 --> 02:53:42.170]  Excuse me?
[02:53:42.170 --> 02:53:43.871]  Excuse me, what did you hear?
[02:53:43.871 --> 02:53:46.332]  I heard him say, I don't want it, I'm not gonna take it.
[02:53:46.332 --> 02:53:48.933]  And she said, your parents signed a form, you have to take it.
[02:53:48.933 --> 02:53:50.614]  And he said, I'm not taking it.
[02:53:50.614 --> 02:53:53.415]  And he walked out of the room, and all you heard was the,
[02:53:54.016 --> 02:53:57.597]  Public health officials trying to lobby his opinion to keep him in there saying that.
[02:53:57.597 --> 02:53:59.038]  But see, that's how this works.
[02:53:59.038 --> 02:54:03.819]  One person says no, and half the people in the line go, yeah, I don't want it either.
[02:54:03.819 --> 02:54:11.602]  They were just intimidated under the group psychology, the mob psychology, to do it.
[02:54:11.602 --> 02:54:20.605]  And then once these students started walking in with these printed off flyers, they started asking questions like, have you guys heard of this?
[02:54:20.605 --> 02:54:21.125]  And the nurses
[02:54:21.809 --> 02:54:28.612]  The nurses either wanted to take the flyers or get these vaccines done as quick as they could because every single student walked in with one.
[02:54:28.612 --> 02:54:34.574]  That's when my principal emerged in the hallway with a law enforcement officer and said, go back to class, Robert.
[02:54:34.574 --> 02:54:40.136]  He yelled at me down the hallway, or I'll have you arrested and removed from school grounds.
[02:54:40.136 --> 02:54:42.537]  And I said, I know the policy.
[02:54:42.537 --> 02:54:44.078]  You can't just override the policy.
[02:54:44.078 --> 02:54:47.259]  The policy for being out of class is a detention.
[02:54:47.259 --> 02:54:51.501]  And I was more than willing to take a detention to get these flyers out.
[02:54:52.563 --> 02:54:59.549]  And then, after that, I decided I'd go back to class because I knew that they would ramp up the punishment.
[02:54:59.549 --> 02:55:06.874]  But at 1.30 is when my class ended and they announced, any teachers or faculty that want the vaccine, please report to the science room.
[02:55:06.874 --> 02:55:14.160]  So the bell rang and me and about five other students who are educated on the issue of vaccinations sprinted down to the science room.
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:15.721]  So you came back with cavalry.
[02:55:15.721 --> 02:55:17.282]  I bet they didn't like that.
[02:55:17.282 --> 02:55:21.406]  Now you're trying to warn the adults of the mercury and the cancer viruses.
[02:55:22.468 --> 02:55:31.097]  This time I came back with printed-off articles of the 14-year-old student from Virginia who got Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
[02:55:31.097 --> 02:55:39.284]  And I started telling people about how the Wilkin County Public Health form the kids were given said there's no link to GBS.
[02:55:39.284 --> 02:55:45.090]  And this started raising eyebrows because I had an article that directly linked the swine flu to GBS.
[02:55:45.788 --> 02:55:48.971]  But the public health official was not about to let me in.
[02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:55.176]  She actually pushed me as I was going in the door and then put one hand on each side of the door and said, you're not coming through.
[02:55:55.176 --> 02:55:57.497]  So I could not get in.
[02:55:57.497 --> 02:56:06.465]  But what I did was I ducked and slid under her arm into the vaccine room where some teachers were already being vaccinated.
[02:56:06.465 --> 02:56:14.091]  I handed out about three or four flyers and the science teacher comes up to me and I said, just let me hand out flyers.
[02:56:15.151 --> 02:56:18.334]  You can get your vaccine, I just want to hand out flyers, and then I'll leave.
[02:56:18.334 --> 02:56:22.837]  He grabs me, both hands by the shirt, and says, get out.
[02:56:22.837 --> 02:56:30.304]  And right now I had a student with a camera, just for protection, in case I would get assaulted.
[02:56:30.304 --> 02:56:38.811]  And he goes, puts his hands out, and says, I'm not assaulting you, and proceeds to ram me with his chest, to make it look like he's not assaulting me.
[02:56:38.811 --> 02:56:44.035]  And he rams me out the door, and he notices that there's a student out there that has a camera.
[02:56:44.727 --> 02:56:50.231]  He doesn't know if the camera's filming or not filming, but this obviously upsets him because he just broke the law.
[02:56:50.231 --> 02:56:52.092]  He just put his hands on a minor.
[02:56:52.092 --> 02:56:57.056]  He goes to grab the camera, and the student does a handoff to me.
[02:56:57.056 --> 02:57:05.202]  I start walking down the hallway with the camera, and it takes him a while, but he notices, runs up to me, and what happened next was something that I didn't expect to happen.
[02:57:05.202 --> 02:57:13.688]  I thought he would ask me for the camera, but before asking me, he grabs me by my shoulders and says, give me the camera.
[02:57:14.491 --> 02:57:21.314]  Now, this is... The policy is, if you refuse to give up an electronic device, you receive two detentions.
[02:57:21.314 --> 02:57:34.079]  Now, if the school was just and followed their policies, this would be definitely worth continuing my operation of... But this guy is Judge Dredd, so he's gonna physically punish you.
[02:57:34.079 --> 02:57:37.520]  Yeah, so I said, you know you're not getting the camera.
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:38.881]  Give me the two detentions.
[02:57:38.881 --> 02:57:41.382]  He goes, it doesn't work that way for me.
[02:57:41.382 --> 02:57:43.443]  He then grabs me from behind.
[02:57:44.743 --> 02:57:50.747]  As if he's bear-hugging me, but aggressively, and begins to jerk me around trying to get the camera.
[02:57:50.747 --> 02:57:54.690]  And, which leads to me being flung sideways into a locker.
[02:57:54.690 --> 02:58:05.538]  I then got free, and began to remove the memory card, because I didn't want to be assaulted anymore in the hallway, so I figured I'd give him the camera and keep the memory card for any footage.
[02:58:05.538 --> 02:58:10.682]  And, what he did now then was grab my wrist with the memory card on it, grab my wrist hard and say,
[02:58:11.408 --> 02:58:13.089]  And he said, give me the hard drive.
[02:58:13.089 --> 02:58:14.911]  You're not taking the hard drive.
[02:58:14.911 --> 02:58:16.893]  So he wanted the evidence of what he's done.
[02:58:16.893 --> 02:58:19.735]  I have a special guest with us in the next hour.
[02:58:19.735 --> 02:58:24.779]  We're going to come back in one minute while we're getting that guest ready and have you finish Robert Wannick.
[02:58:24.779 --> 02:58:28.502]  We've got your video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:28.502 --> 02:58:31.505]  You have school witnesses, though, of what they did.
[02:58:31.505 --> 02:58:35.948]  Finish the story and what you're going to do to stand up against these tyrants.
[02:58:35.948 --> 02:58:40.152]  Because if you let them beat you up, next they'll just intensify the abuse.
[02:58:44.053 --> 02:58:53.000]  If you are listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.003]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:56.003 --> 02:59:01.347]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:01.347 --> 02:59:03.389]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:03.389 --> 02:59:08.393]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:08.393 --> 02:59:09.314]  How much do you want?
[02:59:09.554 --> 02:59:10.675]  When do you want it?
[02:59:10.675 --> 02:59:12.556]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:12.556 --> 02:59:13.637]  When will you need it?
[02:59:13.637 --> 02:59:15.838]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:15.838 --> 02:59:17.179]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:17.179 --> 02:59:18.720]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:23.983]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:23.983 --> 02:59:27.566]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:27.566 --> 02:59:31.028]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:31.388 --> 02:59:32.609]  How much will you need?
[02:59:32.609 --> 02:59:33.510]  We don't know.
[02:59:33.510 --> 02:59:34.611]  How much do you want?
[02:59:34.611 --> 02:59:35.531]  All you can get.
[02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:36.632]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:36.632 --> 02:59:39.695]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:39.695 --> 02:59:40.035]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:40.035 --> 02:59:41.877]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:41.877 --> 02:59:42.877]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:42.877 --> 02:59:44.058]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:44.058 --> 02:59:45.920]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.170 --> 03:00:10.712]  We've got the lead singer and founder of Iced Earth.
[03:00:10.712 --> 03:00:16.214]  It's on more than 20 billboard charts around the planet, and on the charts for the last decade.
[03:00:16.214 --> 03:00:19.195]  Very popular heavy metal rock band.
[03:00:19.195 --> 03:00:24.198]  And they're putting out, under the name Sons of Liberty, a free album.
[03:00:25.188 --> 03:00:31.331]  Completely free, and I've listened to a lot of their music off and on over the years, and I'm telling you, this is some of their best music.
[03:00:31.331 --> 03:00:34.633]  And it's all anti-globalist, anti-New World Order.
[03:00:34.633 --> 03:00:37.794]  And the Earth is going into another Ice Age, so what a great name.
[03:00:37.794 --> 03:00:39.315]  Iced Earth here.
[03:00:39.315 --> 03:00:40.636]  Finishing up with Robert Wannick.
[03:00:40.636 --> 03:00:42.737]  Robert, clearly Sunday or Monday.
[03:00:43.237 --> 03:00:43.817]  So what happened next was I
[03:01:07.935 --> 03:01:10.817]  He told me to wait in the hallway for the principal, so I did.
[03:01:10.817 --> 03:01:20.025]  And there was about 20 to 30 students now gathered, waiting in the hallway, just yelling, some of them swearing at the teacher for putting his hands on me.
[03:01:20.025 --> 03:01:23.447]  And when the principal came down, he asked another teacher who was there.
[03:01:23.447 --> 03:01:25.829]  The teacher said, no, he didn't assault him.
[03:01:25.829 --> 03:01:29.192]  As a matter of fact, he didn't put his hands on the student.
[03:01:29.898 --> 03:01:32.959]  This caused just an outrage.
[03:01:32.959 --> 03:01:38.140]  So a total culture of deception, just like cops lie for each other, the teachers do this.
[03:01:38.140 --> 03:01:41.320]  And the students just started yelling, you're a liar, I saw you assault Robert.
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:44.661]  You need to get affidavits signed, take them to court.
[03:01:44.661 --> 03:01:48.102]  I've already got some affidavits signed from over 15 witnesses.
[03:01:48.102 --> 03:01:48.702]  Good.
[03:01:48.702 --> 03:01:50.502]  Now we've got them on line.
[03:01:50.502 --> 03:01:52.522]  We'll get that other teacher fired for lying.
[03:01:52.522 --> 03:01:53.983]  We don't need liars like that.
[03:01:55.876 --> 03:02:07.322]  The other thing is, now we've been trying to... I got called in the office at 310 and told that I was receiving a two-day out-of-school suspension for insubordination and disruption.
[03:02:07.322 --> 03:02:15.827]  All because you politely tried to hand out medical information to students that it's not a forced inoculation?
[03:02:15.827 --> 03:02:18.788]  Yes, and they instigated violence against me.
[03:02:18.788 --> 03:02:20.269]  They caused the disruption.
[03:02:20.808 --> 03:02:26.553]  And I'm getting charged with disruption and getting suspended outside of school.
[03:02:26.553 --> 03:02:30.497]  A three-day suspension is what is merited by- Well, Robert, let's go back.
[03:02:30.497 --> 03:02:31.338]  Robert, let's go back.
[03:02:32.213 --> 03:02:37.917]  Briefly, to three years ago, we had to write an article about this, in Maryland.
[03:02:37.917 --> 03:02:40.058]  And I had the state attorney on.
[03:02:40.058 --> 03:02:41.900]  And he admitted, yeah, there's no law, you gotta take it.
[03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:44.862]  But they told 2,000 parents and kids this.
[03:02:44.862 --> 03:02:51.206]  They lined up with SWAT teams and police dogs and wouldn't let the activists tell them it wasn't the law.
[03:02:51.206 --> 03:02:55.729]  And then on CNN, mainly black people, crying, saying, I don't want to take it.
[03:02:55.729 --> 03:02:58.751]  I get sick when I take it, but it's the law.
[03:02:58.751 --> 03:03:01.853]  You're not even allowed to tell them it's not the law.
[03:03:01.853 --> 03:03:02.073]  Go ahead.
[03:03:02.113 --> 03:03:04.895]  Absolutely right.
[03:03:04.895 --> 03:03:11.099]  When it's not even mandatory, when it's voluntary, you're not even allowed to give them risk peacefully.
[03:03:11.099 --> 03:03:20.126]  And I'm being harassed and threatened more, saying if I release any footage, I'll receive more suspension and they'll possibly recommend expulsion.
[03:03:20.126 --> 03:03:30.193]  So, so, so, so, I mean, to be clear, you have witnesses on video, that's up on YouTube, but they're saying if you release any more footage, they're saying outside of school, you're not allowed to stand up to them.
[03:03:30.578 --> 03:03:32.299]  No, any footage from inside the school.
[03:03:32.299 --> 03:03:37.484]  Like, if you watch the video, I have a few clips that are from inside the school that I have written consent to release.
[03:03:37.484 --> 03:03:48.212]  Those are allegedly going to merit me with more... Well, they're just trying to cover up what happened, and they better watch it, because this is starting to turn into racketeering.
[03:03:48.212 --> 03:03:50.854]  So, where are you going from here, Robert?
[03:03:50.854 --> 03:03:57.600]  I mean, I think the way to do it is now get with a hundred of the young men and women, and all of you hand out flyers per class.
[03:03:58.300 --> 03:03:59.901]  They won't be able to stop that.
[03:03:59.901 --> 03:04:03.282]  What you did was bold because it made them show that they're the tyrants.
[03:04:03.282 --> 03:04:04.423]  They went after you.
[03:04:04.423 --> 03:04:06.044]  Now it's the talk of the school.
[03:04:06.044 --> 03:04:09.285]  Now everyone will want the forbidden literature.
[03:04:09.285 --> 03:04:13.947]  Now you have the school in your hand as you rebel against the system.
[03:04:13.947 --> 03:04:18.449]  Now you are literally launching the Sons of Liberty program.
[03:04:18.449 --> 03:04:27.033]  What I'm doing now is pressing charges against the teacher who assaulted me because the school has not taken legal action and will not release any security footage.
[03:04:27.492 --> 03:04:31.337]  We have no clue if they even still have the footage on camera.
[03:04:31.337 --> 03:04:32.979]  You need to put a press release out.
[03:04:32.979 --> 03:04:38.045]  See, notice, they're lying, you have affidavits, and notice their cameras malfunction.
[03:04:38.045 --> 03:04:42.191]  We'll talk to you Sunday or Monday with a more detailed report on this, Robert.
[03:04:42.191 --> 03:04:43.392]  But this is big.
[03:04:43.392 --> 03:04:44.293]  But I suggest...
[03:04:45.094 --> 03:04:50.722]  Maybe back off for a while, just so you can get back to school and have everyone hand out flyers.
[03:04:50.722 --> 03:04:59.453]  And everyone across the nation, you should be giving flyers to people in school, instead of just worshipping big government and taking Ritalin and Prozac.
[03:04:59.453 --> 03:05:01.215]  Robert Wannick, we salute you!

[03:06:02.171 --> 03:06:07.497]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:07.497 --> 03:06:09.580]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:06:09.580 --> 03:06:12.022]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:12.022 --> 03:06:14.305]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[03:07:02.042 --> 03:07:06.605]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:06.605 --> 03:07:07.505]  Number one.
[03:07:07.505 --> 03:07:10.928]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:10.928 --> 03:07:11.788]  Number two.
[03:07:11.788 --> 03:07:16.691]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:16.691 --> 03:07:17.432]  It's true.
[03:07:17.432 --> 03:07:22.295]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:22.295 --> 03:07:23.135]  Number three.
[03:07:23.135 --> 03:07:26.718]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:26.718 --> 03:07:30.420]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:31.421]  Number 4.
[03:07:31.421 --> 03:07:34.163]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:34.163 --> 03:07:37.847]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:37.847 --> 03:07:38.648]  Number 5.
[03:07:38.648 --> 03:07:42.791]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:42.791 --> 03:07:47.556]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:47.836 --> 03:07:52.002]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:52.002 --> 03:07:53.805]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:53.805 --> 03:07:56.068]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:07:56.068 --> 03:07:58.411]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:08:52.048 --> 03:08:54.349]  We're going to be playing more of it in the next hour.
[03:08:54.349 --> 03:09:01.793]  I am really flattered that he came all the way to Austin, Texas to be with us today for the rest of the hour.
[03:09:01.793 --> 03:09:10.577]  And I mean, I know that a lot of people at the office are big Iced Earth fans, and I know I'd heard the music over the years and really liked it.
[03:09:10.577 --> 03:09:12.918]  I don't have a lot of time to get into music in the last decade.
[03:09:12.918 --> 03:09:14.799]  I'm working all the time.
[03:09:14.799 --> 03:09:18.081]  But then I heard the new album that we were sent.
[03:09:18.081 --> 03:09:20.422]  It's being released today free online.
[03:09:21.243 --> 03:09:25.607]  In coordination with this live radio show and when I heard the music a few weeks ago.
[03:09:25.607 --> 03:09:26.228]  I'm like man.
[03:09:26.228 --> 03:09:31.875]  This is awesome I mean listen to these lyrics an act of stealth a silent coup d'etat
[03:09:32.981 --> 03:09:39.325]  Corrupted leaders hijack freedom, acting in duress, and it goes on to talk about the creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:09:39.325 --> 03:09:41.506]  That's the name of that track.
[03:09:41.506 --> 03:09:46.850]  It talks about the answer to 1984 is 1776, and we are going to stand against your tyranny.
[03:09:46.850 --> 03:09:51.933]  We are agents of free humanity in the Fed, in the Fed, in the Fed, and it goes on and on.
[03:09:51.933 --> 03:09:56.016]  And I know that this Sons of Liberty albums
[03:09:56.536 --> 03:10:05.483]  Produced separately from Iced Earth, because obviously the record company wouldn't let them do that, is just an amazing gift to those that love Liberty.
[03:10:05.483 --> 03:10:10.447]  And talking about the Billboard charts for more than a decade, Iced Earth's a huge rock band.
[03:10:10.447 --> 03:10:23.096]  They're not just in the top 100 here in the US, but the top 100 in Canada, number 19 in Germany, number 6 in England, number 28 in Sweden, Norway, Greece, Austria, Finland.
[03:10:23.977 --> 03:10:26.260]  All over the world, Ice Earth is huge.
[03:10:26.260 --> 03:10:28.703]  I think it's safe to say even bigger outside the U.S.
[03:10:28.703 --> 03:10:30.626]  than they are in the U.S., but they're big here.
[03:10:30.626 --> 03:10:37.555]  And so, this is so exciting to have Dave Mustaine come out against the New World Order and Iced Earth, and just more and more people are having these awakenings.
[03:10:37.555 --> 03:10:39.077]  That's what Dave Mustaine calls it.
[03:10:39.077 --> 03:10:39.838]  That's what I had.
[03:10:41.279 --> 03:10:44.480]  We were all once shuttered in, not seeing the larger picture.
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:55.004]  And so I'm very honored to have the lead singer here from Iced Earth, the lead singer from Sons of Liberty, John Schaefer, here with us today.
[03:10:55.004 --> 03:10:55.864]  John, it's great to have you.
[03:10:57.466 --> 03:11:01.210]  Well, it's great to have you here as well.
[03:11:01.210 --> 03:11:11.281]  Tell us about Iced Earth, Sons of Liberty, Your Awakening, why you're releasing this album for free today, and we'll give people the website so they can check out sons-of-liberty.net.
[03:11:13.578 --> 03:11:16.821]  Well, first of all, I'm actually not the lead singer of Ice Earth.
[03:11:16.821 --> 03:11:19.604]  This is the first album I've ever done lead vocals on.
[03:11:19.604 --> 03:11:22.126]  I've just seen some of their songs where you are singing.
[03:11:22.126 --> 03:11:24.208]  Yeah, there's a couple that I've done in the past.
[03:11:24.208 --> 03:11:25.530]  I guess it's the one we were watching last week.
[03:11:25.530 --> 03:11:26.551]  Yeah, it could have been.
[03:11:26.551 --> 03:11:28.813]  Yeah, the dark-haired guy is singing a lot too.
[03:11:28.813 --> 03:11:30.414]  What's his name?
[03:11:30.414 --> 03:11:33.377]  It depends on which period of the video it was.
[03:11:33.377 --> 03:11:33.858]  See, that's the thing.
[03:11:33.858 --> 03:11:35.639]  I saw different people singing, but I saw you singing.
[03:11:36.320 --> 03:11:44.822]  But anyway, the main thing I think that's important about this is that the awakening that I had was about nine months ago.
[03:11:44.822 --> 03:11:48.743]  And like you, I've been working, you know, constantly for the last 20 years.
[03:11:48.743 --> 03:11:50.144]  I mean, barely taking any vacation.
[03:11:50.144 --> 03:11:53.905]  Well, finally, after the last European tour that we did, I went to Central America for a month.
[03:11:54.639 --> 03:11:58.500]  And then that time, after about a week, I really felt different.
[03:11:58.500 --> 03:11:59.161]  It was weird.
[03:11:59.161 --> 03:12:06.823]  It was like, wait a minute, you know, without all the bombardment of corporate America everywhere and just... The constant distractions.
[03:12:06.823 --> 03:12:07.984]  Absolutely.
[03:12:07.984 --> 03:12:14.186]  And so it was in that period that I really started questioning things and thinking about things a lot and I get back home and
[03:12:15.046 --> 03:12:19.688]  And I start seeing that Obama's doing exactly the same things that Bush is doing.
[03:12:19.688 --> 03:12:22.589]  And it starts, it also starts raising a lot of questions.
[03:12:22.589 --> 03:12:33.233]  And I had, somebody sent me the Zeitgeist Addendum, and when I watched that, the money creation thing, it really, like, I thought at first, this can't be real.
[03:12:33.233 --> 03:12:39.896]  Because I didn't know about the Federal Reserve, I thought, like many people, that this was part of government, that it was, you know, a legit
[03:12:40.822 --> 03:12:50.195]  Situation well anyway, I started doing more research and one thing led to another and it was really I would say seeing Well the creature from Jekyll Island reading that book
[03:12:51.124 --> 03:12:54.525]  Um, certainly opened my eyes and then watching the Obama deception.
[03:12:54.525 --> 03:13:00.527]  And I think that's when I had my epiphany, which was really, um, it was, it was devastating actually at first.
[03:13:00.527 --> 03:13:05.208]  I mean, I felt like I had a thousand pounds on my chest, like everything I ever believed in.
[03:13:05.208 --> 03:13:12.750]  Cause I've always been a huge fan of the revolutionary war period and I'm walking around my whole life thinking all this stuff is relevant, that it still matters.
[03:13:12.750 --> 03:13:15.551]  I mean, it does matter to those of us that are real patriots, but I mean,
[03:13:16.411 --> 03:13:18.031]  We've been hijacked and we don't even know it.
[03:13:18.031 --> 03:13:18.831]  Most of the people don't know.
[03:13:18.831 --> 03:13:19.352]  Exactly.
[03:13:19.352 --> 03:13:23.592]  What we really are has been lost and the founders were all about stopping the bankers.
[03:13:23.592 --> 03:13:28.993]  They were all about stopping the manipulators and stopping the people that set up these monopolies.
[03:13:28.993 --> 03:13:29.353]  Right.
[03:13:29.353 --> 03:13:32.694]  And we're not taught what really, why America was special.
[03:13:32.694 --> 03:13:35.414]  We're not taught what 1776 really means.
[03:13:35.414 --> 03:13:36.114]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:13:36.114 --> 03:13:39.535]  I mean, and that was like, I mean, I literally broke down and cried.
[03:13:39.535 --> 03:13:40.575]  I mean, it was devastating.
[03:13:40.575 --> 03:13:44.616]  It was a huge, but it was also, you know, I started digging more and it was,
[03:13:45.516 --> 03:13:53.822]  As angry as I got and as sad as I have gone through periods where I've been really sad about it, I also feel liberated because now it makes sense.
[03:13:53.822 --> 03:13:56.004]  That's the thing that people have to realize.
[03:13:56.004 --> 03:13:57.645]  You can't be afraid of this.
[03:13:57.645 --> 03:14:01.808]  You have to take this knowledge and you have to hold on to it.
[03:14:01.808 --> 03:14:07.552]  For me, it's liberating to have the truth because I can't actually go through life with half-truths.
[03:14:07.552 --> 03:14:08.012]  Nobody can.
[03:14:09.073 --> 03:14:16.079]  Now you don't feel good, even if you don't know what the truth is, but you know it's a lie, you have this weak feeling.
[03:14:16.079 --> 03:14:32.054]  But even if something is horrible that's happening, once you know the score, it is liberating, it's empowering to know the truth, it will set you free, even if you're in a bad situation, because then you realize, even if I was still ignorant, if I was still in darkness, this corruption was there all along.
[03:14:32.855 --> 03:14:36.881]  But so many people in the modern age believe perception is reality.
[03:14:36.881 --> 03:14:38.924]  Perception is not reality.
[03:14:38.924 --> 03:14:44.614]  You can have a blindfold on and think you're walking through a field, but really you're walking off the edge of a skyscraper.
[03:14:44.614 --> 03:14:46.937]  Just because you're blind doesn't mean that you're safe.
[03:14:47.386 --> 03:14:49.047]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:14:49.047 --> 03:14:49.628]  I agree, man.
[03:14:49.628 --> 03:14:51.970]  And I mean, that's the thing.
[03:14:51.970 --> 03:14:56.093]  I actually feel so much better knowing why everything is so screwed up.
[03:14:56.093 --> 03:15:01.897]  And I understand for people that it's very difficult to get out of that left-right paradigm.
[03:15:01.897 --> 03:15:05.800]  I mean, for me, I've lost friends in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:09.163]  My little brother did two tours over in Iraq, and he's fine.
[03:15:09.163 --> 03:15:15.648]  But I mean, knowing now that this whole thing is fraud, I supported it before because I bought into it.
[03:15:15.708 --> 03:15:19.952]  Well they say 1776 is our military and this empire.
[03:15:19.952 --> 03:15:21.793]  But really, that's the exact opposite.
[03:15:21.793 --> 03:15:22.975]  That's King George III.
[03:15:22.975 --> 03:15:24.236]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:15:24.236 --> 03:15:26.077]  And I see it now for what it is.
[03:15:26.077 --> 03:15:32.183]  But that doesn't take away from the heroism, the honor of the troops who believe they're doing a good thing.
[03:15:32.483 --> 03:15:32.803]  Absolutely.
[03:15:51.060 --> 03:16:01.131]  I mean, I wasn't hugely into it, but I listened to quite a bit of heavy metal off and on when I heard it on the radio and I was like, but I like this Sons of Liberty a lot more than Iced Earth, so now I understand.
[03:16:01.131 --> 03:16:05.636]  But it does say here, I'm trying to get your bio straight, that you've been in Iced Earth since the beginning.
[03:16:05.636 --> 03:16:06.257]  Yeah, I started it.
[03:16:06.417 --> 03:16:23.125]  Okay, so you're the founder of iStir, that's the thing I wanted to get straight, because I'd seen some of the songs you were singing, some of them you weren't, and I was confused by it, but now I'm obviously becoming a lot bigger fan of iStir, just because you've created Sons of Liberty, and folks, this is great, great music.
[03:16:23.125 --> 03:16:27.367]  So, tell us about The Awakening, because obviously I'm excited, I get too excited sometimes.
[03:16:28.527 --> 03:16:33.651]  About your awakening and now nine months later, talk about one person doing something.
[03:16:33.651 --> 03:16:40.537]  You've already launched a free album that you're launching today that will reach tens of millions of people.
[03:16:40.537 --> 03:16:41.478]  Well, we can only hope.
[03:16:41.478 --> 03:16:48.303]  I mean, the process was, like I said at first, it was just, I was really devastated and then the more I dug,
[03:16:49.164 --> 03:16:54.067]  The more disturbed I got, but I thought, I can't have this knowledge and not do anything about it.
[03:16:54.067 --> 03:16:55.668]  I mean, the only power I have is music.
[03:16:55.668 --> 03:16:59.971]  So I need to, I said, I got to get my head out of the books for a while and get into the studio.
[03:16:59.971 --> 03:17:03.033]  And the first song I wrote was called Our Dying Republic.
[03:17:03.033 --> 03:17:07.095]  And it has sort of a, it's more of a ballad, I guess.
[03:17:08.536 --> 03:17:14.142]  I guess at that point I was feeling more down than I was angry, so that some of the aggressive stuff came later.
[03:17:14.142 --> 03:17:17.005]  But I decided at that point that I had to do this.
[03:17:17.005 --> 03:17:21.730]  I had to, you know, do it because I was doing research hours and hours a day.
[03:17:21.730 --> 03:17:25.474]  I mean, whenever I find out something that really strikes me, I go for it.
[03:17:25.974 --> 03:17:30.078]  And so, you know, and a lot of your films played a big part in that as well.
[03:17:30.078 --> 03:17:39.928]  And I really recommend people, I mean, probably all of your viewers have already seen that stuff, but if there's Iced Earth fans out there that are tuning in just for this interview, they need to check out Endgame.
[03:17:39.928 --> 03:17:44.712]  Well, that's the great synergy is my listeners tune into what you're doing, your listeners tune into what we're doing.
[03:17:44.712 --> 03:17:45.853]  It's that synergy.
[03:17:45.853 --> 03:17:49.897]  And absolutely, I want to challenge all the Iced Earth fans, all the Sons of Liberty fans,
[03:17:50.798 --> 03:17:51.058]  We're good.
[03:18:13.167 --> 03:18:41.625]  Setting bushfires in the minds of men that that that will explosively Ignite the world with Liberty and you sing about that in your lyrics and that gets me on fire Yeah, man I mean and I hope there's already we've already seen a lot of stuff people think that because this is coming out now that it's an anti-bush thing and they've got to get beyond that because it's These guys are the work for the same people, you know I mean and that's the whole goal is to make to me there's there's so many people that are not aware of the Federal Reserve and and that system is
[03:18:42.265 --> 03:18:43.466]  It's the cancer of our land.
[03:18:43.466 --> 03:18:46.107]  It is absolutely the thing that, it doesn't matter who we elect.
[03:18:46.107 --> 03:18:52.030]  And I fear as much as I think Ron Paul would be awesome, I would fear for his safety.
[03:18:52.030 --> 03:18:52.570]  Absolutely.
[03:18:52.570 --> 03:18:57.353]  We're going to go out to break again with Jekyll Island, some of the lyrics from that.
[03:18:57.353 --> 03:19:11.160]  We're going to come back with a bunch of other great songs like Indentured Servitude, Cleansing Wind, and also some of the other great songs like We the People and others.
[03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:11.620]  Stay with us.
[03:19:17.833 --> 03:19:20.661]  My guys don't normally run the music from this end.
[03:19:20.661 --> 03:19:24.832]  They're out there not watching the clock.
[03:19:24.832 --> 03:19:25.714]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:03.328 --> 03:20:05.309]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:20:05.309 --> 03:20:12.294]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:20:12.294 --> 03:20:20.680]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:20:20.680 --> 03:20:26.404]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:20:26.584 --> 03:20:28.426]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:20:28.426 --> 03:20:30.728]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:20:30.728 --> 03:20:35.133]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:20:35.133 --> 03:20:37.355]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:20:37.355 --> 03:20:44.903]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:21:04.239 --> 03:21:08.242]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:08.242 --> 03:21:11.505]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:11.505 --> 03:21:12.926]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:13.610 --> 03:21:16.291]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:16.291 --> 03:21:22.673]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:22.673 --> 03:21:27.715]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:27.715 --> 03:21:37.838]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:37.958 --> 03:21:40.299]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:40.299 --> 03:21:41.900]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:44.361]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:44.361 --> 03:21:46.482]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:46.482 --> 03:21:51.624]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:51.624 --> 03:21:56.646]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:22:03.482 --> 03:22:05.243]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:22:05.243 --> 03:22:07.645]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:22:07.645 --> 03:22:11.207]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:22:11.207 --> 03:22:15.970]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:22:15.970 --> 03:22:21.133]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:22:21.733 --> 03:22:26.238]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:22:26.238 --> 03:22:32.684]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:22:32.684 --> 03:22:34.326]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:22:34.326 --> 03:22:40.812]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[03:22:40.812 --> 03:22:42.434]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[03:22:42.754 --> 03:22:44.535]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[03:23:05.427 --> 03:23:07.268]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[03:23:07.268 --> 03:23:09.069]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[03:23:09.069 --> 03:23:13.031]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[03:23:13.031 --> 03:23:17.573]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[03:23:17.573 --> 03:23:22.175]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.

[03:23:28.019 --> 03:23:37.105]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[03:23:37.105 --> 03:23:40.126]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[03:23:55.881 --> 03:23:56.262]  Call 1-800-360-8306.

[03:24:20.664 --> 03:24:23.445]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[03:24:23.445 --> 03:24:27.427]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[03:24:27.427 --> 03:24:32.069]  President Bush said, and it's right that I often use myself, that we needed a new world order.
[03:24:32.069 --> 03:24:37.712]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:24:37.712 --> 03:24:44.234]  I think the new world order that he's referring to... We have a real chance at this new world order.
[03:24:44.234 --> 03:24:49.897]  An order in which incredible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision
[03:24:54.592 --> 03:24:56.349]  Of this free album, folks!
[03:24:57.210 --> 03:25:04.516]  The album that John Schafer has poured his heart and soul into is Sons-of-Liberty.net.
[03:25:04.516 --> 03:25:13.884]  The album is Sons of Liberty, brush fires, I call it bush fires, but it's brush fires in the minds of men.
[03:25:13.884 --> 03:25:16.927]  That's actually what Thomas Jefferson said.
[03:25:16.927 --> 03:25:21.151]  Down here in Texas, brush turns into bush fires.
[03:25:21.151 --> 03:25:24.454]  And you go to the site, it's MyInfo, Ron Paul, G. Edward Griffin.
[03:25:25.714 --> 03:25:37.979]  I can't thank you enough for doing this, John, and for having G. Edward Griffin get in contact with us and give us the CD and say that, hey, Mr. Schaefer would like to break this on your show, thinks it's the ideal place to do it.
[03:25:37.979 --> 03:25:40.560]  Again, I'm just super excited, and I hope the listeners
[03:25:41.780 --> 03:25:47.183]  Take advantage of this and then don't go, oh, this guy could have made millions of dollars off this like your other albums do.
[03:25:47.183 --> 03:25:49.865]  You know, he made it for us for free.
[03:25:49.865 --> 03:25:51.306]  We're not going to appreciate this.
[03:25:51.306 --> 03:25:55.608]  I hope everybody gets this new album, Sons of Liberty, out to everyone.
[03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.730]  Yeah, me too.
[03:25:56.730 --> 03:25:58.251]  I mean, that's the whole point of doing it.
[03:25:58.251 --> 03:26:05.874]  They can purchase a higher resolution audio quality for like $7.99 and a download, and there will be at some point physical distribution where it will be in the store.
[03:26:05.874 --> 03:26:07.175]  Oh, that's good to fund yourself.
[03:26:07.175 --> 03:26:07.975]  We need to do that.
[03:26:07.975 --> 03:26:10.936]  Yeah, I mean, exactly, because it cost me a lot of money to do this.
[03:26:10.936 --> 03:26:13.837]  But I mean, my thing is copy it.
[03:26:13.837 --> 03:26:15.098]  If you buy a CD, copy it.
[03:26:15.098 --> 03:26:17.559]  It costs money for you to fly here to Texas to promote it.
[03:26:17.559 --> 03:26:18.339]  Yeah.
[03:26:18.339 --> 03:26:19.420]  Time is really what...
[03:26:20.714 --> 03:26:21.955]  Yeah, that too.
[03:26:21.955 --> 03:26:24.518]  I mean, but you know, this is important stuff.
[03:26:24.518 --> 03:26:25.459]  It's a big deal for me.
[03:26:25.459 --> 03:26:32.346]  So I mean to spend the time and I would have been doing another project in place of this had I not done this record, but I decided to
[03:26:33.131 --> 03:26:35.654]  You know, everything had to kind of go on hold.
[03:26:35.654 --> 03:26:44.904]  Well, going back 14 years ago, I pioneered and I mean, I wasn't aware of what I was doing, but I did pioneer saying, here, my film's free.
[03:26:44.904 --> 03:26:50.610]  And then that actually woke up a lot of people and created a large listening base, which later made us financially
[03:26:52.532 --> 03:26:53.313]  We're good to go.
[03:27:12.725 --> 03:27:27.656]  Well, basically from the time that I wrote the first song, Our Dying Republic, then it turned into, the idea kind of blossomed into, you know, I went into the studio that day, I literally wrote that song and recorded it, programmed the drums, did the vocals and everything in one day.
[03:27:27.656 --> 03:27:29.938]  I mean, I was that, like, shook up about it.
[03:27:30.598 --> 03:27:34.821]  And from that point on, I was thinking, you know, what can I do?
[03:27:34.821 --> 03:27:35.862]  What can I do with this?
[03:27:35.862 --> 03:27:43.228]  And I just decided to go for it and, you know, make it a full... I guess it is sort of a concept album.
[03:27:43.228 --> 03:27:45.890]  I mean, it's certainly the same theme running through it.
[03:27:45.890 --> 03:27:48.832]  And it's the song The Cleansing Wind on there, that's about my...
[03:27:49.873 --> 03:28:00.200]  My trip to Central America and how that was really the thing that made me realize that it was kind of the beginning of the breaking free of the matrix.
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:00.821]  You know what I mean?
[03:28:00.821 --> 03:28:03.763]  Being down at a place where you literally are with nature.
[03:28:03.763 --> 03:28:06.965]  It was just me and my family spending good quality time together for a month.
[03:28:06.965 --> 03:28:10.267]  And after a week or 10 days, I physically began to feel different.
[03:28:10.267 --> 03:28:11.268]  I'm thinking, what is this?
[03:28:11.268 --> 03:28:11.908]  What's going on?
[03:28:11.908 --> 03:28:14.250]  And it's just the whole process.
[03:28:14.250 --> 03:28:15.931]  And so by the time I got home, you know,
[03:28:17.492 --> 03:28:35.554]  I knew something was up like it was weird it was just so so you woke up totally independently before you started searching for more info yeah there was wow that's really there was that's powerful there was a different feeling there you know the water was different the whole thing oh yeah no no I mean it's all the frequency pollution the water they put poison
[03:28:35.974 --> 03:28:38.835]  On record in there, you know, to destabilize people.
[03:28:38.835 --> 03:28:49.938]  It's the flashing lights, the signs, the busyness, how we're all so distracted that we are really programmed when you get in nature for a couple days.
[03:28:49.938 --> 03:28:59.320]  I mean, this happens to me, but now I can almost not take it because then I start really understanding levels I hadn't and it's just my brain starts moving too quick.
[03:28:59.320 --> 03:29:04.762]  I mean, I know for you it was good to wake up out there, but now I'm almost scared to go away to the jungle for two weeks because
[03:29:05.382 --> 03:29:11.104]  Because, I mean, I already know too much, and it's just, and now, it's starting to really get spooky.
[03:29:11.104 --> 03:29:11.304]  Right.
[03:29:11.304 --> 03:29:15.685]  Well, hey, you know, and the thing is that people out there can, they can call us kooks all they want.
[03:29:15.685 --> 03:29:19.206]  The fact is that the research is there.
[03:29:19.206 --> 03:29:20.046]  You know, do it.
[03:29:20.046 --> 03:29:20.727]  Get informed.
[03:29:20.727 --> 03:29:27.869]  If you want to, you can't say, because honestly, I thought a lot of this stuff that I heard, my father was a John Birch guy.
[03:29:27.869 --> 03:29:28.669]  So, you know,
[03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:35.392]  When I was a young child, I remember certain things that him and his friends would talk about concerning the United Nations and stuff.
[03:29:35.392 --> 03:29:37.873]  And then there was a point where he just didn't talk about it anymore.
[03:29:37.873 --> 03:29:41.515]  And unfortunately, he died a couple years ago, so I can't talk to him now.
[03:29:41.515 --> 03:29:42.296]  I wish I could.
[03:29:42.296 --> 03:29:49.099]  Oh, so there were those seeds, and now, 20, 30 years later, everything he was talking about is now coming true on the nightly news.
[03:29:49.099 --> 03:29:49.560]  Stay with us.
[03:29:49.560 --> 03:29:53.081]  We'll be right back with more Sons of Liberty.
[03:29:53.081 --> 03:29:54.462]  We're on the march.
[03:29:54.462 --> 03:29:55.963]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.984 --> 03:29:59.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.237 --> 03:30:06.259]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:06.259 --> 03:30:11.581]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:11.581 --> 03:30:13.642]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:13.642 --> 03:30:18.645]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:18.645 --> 03:30:19.826]  How much do you want?
[03:30:19.826 --> 03:30:20.946]  When do you want it?
[03:30:20.946 --> 03:30:22.827]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:22.827 --> 03:30:23.908]  When will you need it?
[03:30:23.908 --> 03:30:26.109]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:26.109 --> 03:30:27.450]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:27.450 --> 03:30:28.970]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:28.970 --> 03:30:30.011]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:30:30.171 --> 03:30:31.492]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:30:31.492 --> 03:30:34.215]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:34.215 --> 03:30:37.819]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:37.819 --> 03:30:41.643]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:41.643 --> 03:30:42.865]  How much will you need?
[03:30:42.865 --> 03:30:43.766]  We don't know.
[03:30:43.766 --> 03:30:44.867]  How much do you want?
[03:30:44.867 --> 03:30:45.608]  All you can get.
[03:30:45.608 --> 03:30:46.609]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:46.889 --> 03:30:49.931]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:49.931 --> 03:30:52.172]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:52.172 --> 03:30:53.152]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:02.256 --> 03:31:07.563]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:31:07.563 --> 03:31:09.646]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:31:09.646 --> 03:31:12.089]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:12.089 --> 03:31:14.352]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:14.352 --> 03:31:15.994]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:15.994 --> 03:31:17.016]  There is a solution.
[03:31:17.256 --> 03:31:25.680]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:32:02.159 --> 03:32:06.282]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:32:06.282 --> 03:32:09.144]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:09.144 --> 03:32:10.425]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:32:10.425 --> 03:32:11.245]  It's very real.
[03:32:11.245 --> 03:32:13.487]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[03:33:19.139 --> 03:33:31.886]  Without distractions Far from chaos Born with nature I see what I'm meant to be As the winds wash over me
[03:33:36.278 --> 03:33:49.683]  A chain reaction I have awakened To only question what I've been led to believe My quest for true liberty
[03:33:57.272 --> 03:34:12.316]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[03:34:12.316 --> 03:34:13.837]  That's Cleansing Wind.
[03:34:13.837 --> 03:34:16.658]  And again, a free album, complete album.
[03:34:17.758 --> 03:34:31.026]  Made by the founder of Iced Earth, John Schaefer, available for free at Sons-of-Liberty.net or you can simply go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:34:31.026 --> 03:34:42.754]  We've got links up there today and also when we post this later to PrisonPlanet.tv, we'll put a link to the site there and then later when this is posted to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, up in the corner,
[03:34:43.374 --> 03:34:49.895]  We will also post a link to go get the free album, and hopefully you'll spread it with others.
[03:34:49.895 --> 03:34:55.396]  For rock and roll and heavy metal fans, this will certainly be another big awakening.
[03:34:55.396 --> 03:35:03.158]  And again, so many people in Hollywood and in music and in science and in culture are shattering the left-right paradigm.
[03:35:03.158 --> 03:35:08.619]  Look at how the left is coming out now against the health care plan, finding out it was all a big rip-off for banks.
[03:35:09.159 --> 03:35:11.261]  I mean, everything is a rip-off for banks.
[03:35:11.261 --> 03:35:12.802]  They control the world.
[03:35:12.802 --> 03:35:20.570]  Anything and everything they do, banker bailouts, Kyoto, Copenhagen, healthcare, it's all going to be a scam.
[03:35:20.570 --> 03:35:24.693]  Just like you said before the break, get past the puppets, get to the bankers.
[03:35:24.693 --> 03:35:26.795]  So continue with your awakening, John Schaefer.
[03:35:26.795 --> 03:35:33.542]  Well, when you say that too, that's the thing that I think infuriates me because I'm a huge supporter of the troops and I know that they are
[03:35:35.768 --> 03:35:45.393]  Doing what they believe is right and and they but the thing is when you figure out that this is all happening for For a bunch of bankers, you know an elitist.
[03:35:45.393 --> 03:35:55.019]  It's it's a it's a horrible thing I mean, it's just absolutely horrible so awareness to that institution has got to be it's got to be brought to the forefront if we're gonna have any chance at correcting a
[03:35:55.219 --> 03:35:56.599]  And that's the thing about war.
[03:35:56.599 --> 03:35:59.160]  The guys fighting and dying, they are heroic.
[03:35:59.160 --> 03:36:00.941]  They are saving their bodies.
[03:36:00.941 --> 03:36:03.542]  But they've been put in a fraudulent situation.
[03:36:03.542 --> 03:36:07.723]  And so they start confusing their heroism with the overall evil.
[03:36:07.723 --> 03:36:09.163]  And the government does that on purpose.
[03:36:09.163 --> 03:36:11.724]  They say, look at these troops with their arms and legs blown off.
[03:36:11.724 --> 03:36:13.124]  They've got courage.
[03:36:13.124 --> 03:36:15.345]  That's only meant to make the system look good.
[03:36:15.345 --> 03:36:15.665]  Right.
[03:36:15.665 --> 03:36:16.065]  I know.
[03:36:16.065 --> 03:36:17.686]  I mean... But I'm interrupting.
[03:36:17.686 --> 03:36:19.066]  Continue with your Awakening.
[03:36:19.066 --> 03:36:21.187]  Continue with some of the other songs in the album.
[03:36:23.113 --> 03:36:24.714]  Well, let's run down the list.
[03:36:24.714 --> 03:36:28.114]  I mean, basically, Jekyll Island, we've talked about that.
[03:36:28.114 --> 03:36:31.335]  I think everybody needs to get this book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:36:31.335 --> 03:36:38.997]  It's absolutely crucial in the whole scheme to understand what is going on in our world.
[03:36:38.997 --> 03:36:41.438]  And I actually just started another one of
[03:36:42.481 --> 03:36:42.701]  I don't
[03:36:57.981 --> 03:37:03.424]  Like it's good when it's actually the root cause of everything that's wrong actually, you know, in so many ways.
[03:37:03.424 --> 03:37:14.090]  So, I mean, we have to be aware of that and I strongly recommend people get The Creature from Jekyll Island because that book will open your eyes big time.
[03:37:14.090 --> 03:37:15.991]  It's thoroughly researched.
[03:37:15.991 --> 03:37:16.592]  It's fact.
[03:37:16.592 --> 03:37:17.952]  It's real.
[03:37:17.952 --> 03:37:20.153]  And so, Don't Tread on Me is the next song.
[03:37:20.153 --> 03:37:21.294]  That's another one we can run down.
[03:37:21.294 --> 03:37:22.295]  I mean, that's kind of a
[03:37:23.928 --> 03:37:26.713]  I mean, all of these have obviously the very similar theme.
[03:37:26.713 --> 03:37:34.187]  They may touch on different points of the whole scenario, but that sort of...
[03:37:35.605 --> 03:37:40.206]  Hopefully with the verses, the lyrics in the verses, it's going to make people think a little bit.
[03:37:40.206 --> 03:37:47.248]  Even if they aren't listening to this show right now, and they don't know, but they just hear the song, hopefully they can hear the lyrics.
[03:37:47.248 --> 03:37:58.531]  And we did mix this to where, normally on a metal record, I would never mix the vocals this loud, but my producer engineer and I thought, the message is so important on this that we really need to put it out there.
[03:37:59.861 --> 03:38:00.822]  Absolutely.
[03:38:00.822 --> 03:38:13.578]  Guys, I want to go out, not with the end of Cleansing Wind, let's be sure and go out with that particularly powerful part of Jekyll Island where it's got the clip about 1984-1776 in the Fed.
[03:38:17.423 --> 03:38:22.764]  And then if we've got time to get the CD in there, perhaps we should play Don't Tread on Me or part of it.
[03:38:22.764 --> 03:38:29.885]  Pick a spot to play in the middle of this segment because you came all the way to Texas and time is running out already.
[03:38:29.885 --> 03:38:31.145]  So much to talk about.
[03:38:31.145 --> 03:38:35.506]  But again, Sons-of-Liberty.net.
[03:38:35.506 --> 03:38:41.387]  Free album launched today, Friday, December 18th, 2009.
[03:38:41.387 --> 03:38:45.648]  And you told me that, talk about synergy or synchronicity.
[03:38:45.648 --> 03:38:46.488]  You were in an airport.
[03:38:47.208 --> 03:38:55.634]  And somebody walked up to you and said, hey brother, check it out, Sons of Liberty, a national biker group who are against the New World Order.
[03:38:55.634 --> 03:38:57.295]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[03:38:57.295 --> 03:39:04.020]  And the last domino to fall is the population, people like yourself, myself, who are awakened.
[03:39:04.020 --> 03:39:11.405]  We don't understand, we're already pretty much the majority because the controlled media still has that illusion going that we're the minority, that we're the weirdos.
[03:39:11.405 --> 03:39:14.567]  No, there is a huge awakening happening right now.
[03:39:14.567 --> 03:39:14.887]  There is.
[03:39:16.428 --> 03:39:16.948]  I hope.
[03:39:16.948 --> 03:39:18.429]  My fear is I hope it's not too late.
[03:39:18.429 --> 03:39:19.409]  You know, that's the only thing.
[03:39:19.409 --> 03:39:25.631]  And I know that there are many people out there, many groups out there that are trying to do the right thing.
[03:39:25.631 --> 03:39:32.793]  And I mean, the Continental Congress that went on this past November, that's a good step in the right direction.
[03:39:32.793 --> 03:39:38.535]  It's just that it's, you know, I really worry about the sovereignty of our country and all the countries on the planet.
[03:39:38.535 --> 03:39:41.896]  You know, I mean, this is very disturbing stuff that's happening here.
[03:39:43.100 --> 03:39:46.152]  You know, but awareness is certainly... I mean, if good people don't...
[03:39:47.304 --> 03:39:50.867]  Don't know what's going on, then there certainly is no hope.
[03:39:50.867 --> 03:39:56.050]  So, they can call me a kook, they can call you a kook, they can do whatever they want, but we're going to get through to some people.
[03:39:56.050 --> 03:39:58.152]  Well, I mean, the denial is over, though.
[03:39:58.152 --> 03:39:59.773]  Open world government's being announced.
[03:39:59.773 --> 03:40:00.213]  For sure.
[03:40:00.213 --> 03:40:08.880]  They're just saying, we're your savior, world government's good, and thank God we've been there, people like your dad, warning people decades ago about the truth.
[03:40:08.880 --> 03:40:16.205]  They got laughed at then, but because those seeds were planted, we have a good fighting chance now because of the people's shoulders we stand on.
[03:40:16.365 --> 03:40:23.548]  Yeah, I guess the thing for me is that even if we find good politicians to send into the place, and that's sort of an oxymoron, isn't it?
[03:40:23.548 --> 03:40:24.289]  Good politician.
[03:40:24.289 --> 03:40:25.429]  But I mean, there are a few.
[03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:32.052]  And if we find to send them and we get them into office, you know, how long are they going to stay good?
[03:40:32.052 --> 03:40:33.333]  How long are they going to stay safe?
[03:40:33.333 --> 03:40:37.595]  You know, these are the things... Yeah, we're dealing with a criminal regime that kills people.
[03:40:37.595 --> 03:40:41.756]  But once we've identified the real regime, killing people won't cut it anymore.
[03:40:41.756 --> 03:40:43.637]  It's like Ceausescu in Romania.
[03:40:43.637 --> 03:40:44.438]  It will finally fall.
[03:40:45.796 --> 03:40:55.822]  Well, and that's why I'm doing this, because I think if I can help in some small way with this stuff, then, you know, it's worth doing.
[03:40:55.822 --> 03:41:05.529]  By the way, the Sons of Liberty website is an awesome news site with links and information, and you've got other sections like, Meet the Shackles.
[03:41:05.529 --> 03:41:07.030]  What happens when you meet the shackles?
[03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:11.513]  Well, it's a little bit of a sarcastic twist on how the New World Order would view
[03:41:12.493 --> 03:41:14.275]  The Sons of Liberty thing.
[03:41:14.275 --> 03:41:18.098]  So people need to click on the Sons of Liberty logo and then go down and meet the Shackles.
[03:41:18.098 --> 03:41:23.262]  A good friend of mine in Sarajevo actually came up with this concept.
[03:41:23.262 --> 03:41:26.645]  I mean, we had the idea of the slavery thing.
[03:41:26.645 --> 03:41:29.087]  A buddy of mine that does a lot of artwork for Iced Earth
[03:41:30.666 --> 03:41:34.331]  That we came up with, but he came up with the shackles and it's really cool.
[03:41:34.331 --> 03:41:41.961]  It's basically a system that, you know, for locking up patriots where you have these handcuffs type things that resemble
[03:41:43.513 --> 03:41:47.354]  The dollar bill and the, or the dollar sign and the infinity sign.
[03:41:47.354 --> 03:41:51.236]  And then, you know, you ram these spikes through and that gives it this, it's pretty twisted.
[03:41:51.236 --> 03:41:52.797]  No, it's powerful.
[03:41:52.797 --> 03:41:53.217]  It works.
[03:41:53.217 --> 03:41:53.877]  You know what's funny?
[03:41:53.877 --> 03:42:05.581]  I hadn't asked you what that meant, but when I looked at it, that's what I picked up is this is eternity, jail bars and a key, which is the idea of you can get freedom anytime you want.
[03:42:05.581 --> 03:42:06.582]  There's a key.
[03:42:06.582 --> 03:42:08.462]  You've just got to discover it.
[03:42:08.462 --> 03:42:09.383]  And, uh,
[03:42:09.983 --> 03:42:17.065]  The only part I missed was the spikes through the wrist, but I guess your wrist... If you turn it vertically, it looks more like the dollar sign that way.
[03:42:17.065 --> 03:42:19.246]  Wow, that is a powerful symbol.
[03:42:19.246 --> 03:42:20.606]  Your buddy's a good artist.
[03:42:20.606 --> 03:42:23.107]  I mean, did you come up with that idea, or the guy in Sarajevo?
[03:42:23.107 --> 03:42:27.629]  No, the guy in Sarajevo came up with that concept, and I was like, you know, this is awesome, man.
[03:42:29.069 --> 03:42:30.170]  So it works perfect.
[03:42:30.170 --> 03:42:39.614]  Well listen, I don't want to just sit here and throw questions at you, and I want to play part of Don't Tread on Me and then go out with my favorite song, of course, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:42:39.614 --> 03:42:50.220]  But while you're here, John Schaefer, founder of Iced Earth, now the founder of Sons of Liberty, and the new album Brushfires in the Minds of Men, points you'd like to make to the millions of people that are going to tune into this?
[03:42:50.931 --> 03:42:54.354]  Uh, the biggest point is just don't be in denial.
[03:42:54.354 --> 03:42:55.855]  Don't put your head back in the sand.
[03:42:55.855 --> 03:42:58.878]  You know, do the research and trust your gut instinct.
[03:42:58.878 --> 03:43:01.520]  If it feels like it's true, it probably is.
[03:43:01.520 --> 03:43:04.262]  And I mean, because there's a lot of misinformation out there on the Internet.
[03:43:04.262 --> 03:43:04.942]  And that's the thing, man.
[03:43:04.942 --> 03:43:08.866]  I didn't even back years ago because of my intense schedule and stuff.
[03:43:08.866 --> 03:43:11.528]  The only thing I use the Internet for was for email.
[03:43:12.048 --> 03:43:15.070]  You know, I never really went out on the websites and did all that stuff.
[03:43:15.070 --> 03:43:21.195]  And since I've awakened, there is a lot of stuff out there that I figure is questionable.
[03:43:21.195 --> 03:43:23.776]  But I'm in tune with my gut.
[03:43:23.776 --> 03:43:28.099]  And when I see something and it resonates, then I go with it.
[03:43:28.099 --> 03:43:30.541]  Because I certainly can't trust Fox News or CNN.
[03:43:30.541 --> 03:43:32.703]  And now that you've gone public, I told you off-air,
[03:43:34.496 --> 03:43:42.438]  People are going to try to bait you and say things that aren't true about you just to get you to respond to them so that you burn your energy proving you're not a bad guy.
[03:43:42.438 --> 03:43:45.898]  Ignore them, but you were a smart guy and go, yeah, Alex, I already know that.
[03:43:45.898 --> 03:43:49.479]  Yeah, they've been doing that anyway just for over banned crap.
[03:43:49.479 --> 03:43:49.959]  You know what I mean?
[03:43:49.959 --> 03:43:51.959]  But this, this is a whole nother level.
[03:43:51.959 --> 03:43:52.800]  So I'm prepared for it.
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:54.320]  And I'm not, I, you know what?
[03:43:54.320 --> 03:43:55.580]  I will not live in fear.
[03:43:55.580 --> 03:43:59.321]  Living in fear or living a life without liberty is like a prison sentence.
[03:43:59.761 --> 03:44:03.603]  I was just warning you like I warn every other prominent person that really stands up.
[03:44:03.603 --> 03:44:05.024]  Get ready for the first trick.
[03:44:05.024 --> 03:44:07.785]  The first dart of the devil.
[03:44:07.785 --> 03:44:10.546]  And I see so many great people who then get diverted by it.
[03:44:10.546 --> 03:44:13.168]  And as soon as you bite, oh, then it's like piranhas.
[03:44:13.168 --> 03:44:15.109]  Yeah, no, I'm not going to play that game.
[03:44:15.109 --> 03:44:15.549]  Not going to happen.
[03:44:15.549 --> 03:44:16.549]  So I'm really not even warning you.
[03:44:16.549 --> 03:44:17.870]  I'm warning the audience out there.
[03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:19.971]  But it's all little lessons.
[03:44:19.971 --> 03:44:21.392]  And of course, I learn more all the time.
[03:44:21.392 --> 03:44:25.294]  I just want people to relive what I had to trial and error experience.
[03:44:25.294 --> 03:44:25.974]  Yeah.
[03:44:25.974 --> 03:44:27.535]  But other points you'd like to make.
[03:44:28.117 --> 03:44:35.023]  Well, I mean, for the Iced Earth fans out there, we're going to be touring South America next month.
[03:44:35.023 --> 03:44:36.544]  Actually, yeah, January.
[03:44:36.544 --> 03:44:38.525]  Late January into February.
[03:44:38.525 --> 03:44:42.088]  And, you know, we'll be working on a new record soon after that.
[03:44:42.088 --> 03:44:46.251]  So as far as Sons of Liberty goes, you know, it's all brand new.
[03:44:46.251 --> 03:44:47.753]  The website is brand new.
[03:44:47.753 --> 03:44:51.936]  We still have a lot of work that we want to do to it, but we wanted to get... I wanted to get this out as soon as possible.
[03:44:51.936 --> 03:44:56.840]  I mean, the Copenhagen thing was really disturbing me, so I wanted to get... I would have liked to have had it out a few weeks ago.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:01.704]  I couldn't do it last week when you wanted to, but luckily you weren't ready, so this week was perfect.
[03:45:01.704 --> 03:45:02.285]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:45:02.285 --> 03:45:06.969]  I mean, I just wanted, but I wish I could have had the production done sooner, all in general, because... No, I know that feeling.
[03:45:06.969 --> 03:45:16.697]  I constantly want to make more films, because once you start getting into it, for me it's so fulfilling to know the truth and to be opposing the corruption that it does consume you.
[03:45:16.697 --> 03:45:19.300]  I mean, are you not feeling more fulfilled?
[03:45:19.300 --> 03:45:20.961]  I mean, you look like a pretty fulfilled guy already.
[03:45:20.961 --> 03:45:21.522]  Absolutely.
[03:45:21.522 --> 03:45:22.623]  I mean, like I said, I feel
[03:45:23.723 --> 03:45:24.744]  It makes sense now.
[03:45:24.744 --> 03:45:26.706]  Everything makes sense.
[03:45:26.706 --> 03:45:29.368]  I can deal with the truth, and I prefer to.
[03:45:29.368 --> 03:45:32.290]  I feel liberated and happier.
[03:45:32.290 --> 03:45:41.818]  It's heavy to know this, but it's also liberating to know this, because now all of the things that you wonder, why is it this way?
[03:45:41.818 --> 03:45:42.999]  Why does it have to be this way?
[03:45:42.999 --> 03:45:45.101]  Well, when you know, then you can work on solving it.
[03:45:46.280 --> 03:45:52.882]  I love this line from Creature from Jekyll Island where you say, we are agents of free humanity.
[03:45:52.882 --> 03:45:53.762]  And that's it.
[03:45:53.762 --> 03:45:57.224]  It's not welcome to the club or welcome to our group.
[03:45:57.224 --> 03:45:59.944]  No, it's welcome to, I'm a sentient free being.
[03:45:59.944 --> 03:46:01.645]  I want the truth, whatever it is.
[03:46:01.645 --> 03:46:05.046]  So I want to say, welcome to free humanity.
[03:46:05.046 --> 03:46:07.707]  Welcome to being an agent, a free agent of liberty.
[03:46:07.987 --> 03:46:08.628]  You got it, brother.
[03:46:08.628 --> 03:46:09.429]  It's awesome to have you here.
[03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:18.838]  Let's play a part of, and people can hear the whole thing at the Sons of Liberty website, but let's play a little bit, a minute or so, or two minutes of Don't Tread on Me.
[03:46:18.838 --> 03:46:21.681]  Then we're going to go out with Crazy from Jekyll Island.
[03:46:21.681 --> 03:46:22.082]  Here it is.
[03:46:43.752 --> 03:46:52.519]  Rushing to the challenge is the first step that you take Are you a free spirit or a slave?
[03:46:52.519 --> 03:46:59.745]  Are the institutions that have molded our minds Pushing an agenda filled with lies?
[03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:22.496]  Watch yourself around me I'm trying to live free
[03:47:40.464 --> 03:47:43.729]  We will strike like a snake
[03:47:50.356 --> 03:47:51.977]  John Schaefer is our guest.
[03:47:51.977 --> 03:47:57.300]  You know what I like, John, is that you're showing so much range here.
[03:47:57.300 --> 03:48:01.342]  And I think now you need to be the lead singer of Ice to Earth, not just the founder.
[03:48:01.342 --> 03:48:03.584]  I'm not knocking your other lead singer, he sounds great.
[03:48:03.584 --> 03:48:05.285]  But I mean, there's a lot of range.
[03:48:05.285 --> 03:48:08.506]  These songs sound different from each other.
[03:48:08.506 --> 03:48:12.729]  I mean, you have a lot of, I mean, not just talent, obviously, but a huge range.
[03:48:14.010 --> 03:48:15.191]  I don't even know where it came from.
[03:48:15.191 --> 03:48:23.418]  I mean, I always heard this stuff in my head, but actually, I don't have the range that I would like to have, and that's one of the reasons that I never even considered doing vocals in Iced Earth.
[03:48:23.418 --> 03:48:26.401]  Well, I meant range of styles, not just range of voice.
[03:48:26.401 --> 03:48:32.866]  Okay, well... I mean, different genre sounds of heavy metal, or... I mean, that song's great!
[03:48:32.866 --> 03:48:34.848]  Yeah, there's a lot of different vibes, too.
[03:48:34.848 --> 03:48:37.871]  I mean, Iced Earth's got a huge catalog, and there's a lot of different vibes in it, but...
[03:48:38.413 --> 03:48:40.454]  I'm not a musician, so I'll use all the wrong terms.
[03:48:40.454 --> 03:48:41.135]  Nah, it's okay.
[03:48:41.135 --> 03:48:42.235]  No range with voices.
[03:48:42.235 --> 03:48:45.157]  I mean, I meant just different, whole different sounds.
[03:48:45.157 --> 03:48:46.297]  Yeah, it does.
[03:48:46.297 --> 03:48:51.761]  I mean, I used a different, for Indentured Servitude, I used a Telecaster through a low-watt amp.
[03:48:51.761 --> 03:48:55.222]  I've never done that before on any Ice Dirt record, but it just, it felt right, you know?
[03:48:55.222 --> 03:48:59.085]  So it's like, there's some different experimental things going on here.
[03:48:59.085 --> 03:49:02.126]  We're gonna go out with my favorite, Jekyll Island.
[03:49:02.126 --> 03:49:03.347]  Get it free right now.
[03:49:03.347 --> 03:49:03.947]  It's Sons-
[03:49:06.148 --> 03:49:09.449]  Suns-of-liberty.com.
[03:49:09.449 --> 03:49:12.591]  Links up at Infowars.net.
[03:49:12.591 --> 03:49:13.871]  Can't get anything right here today.
[03:49:13.871 --> 03:49:14.271]  Here it is.
[03:50:20.103 --> 03:50:23.565]  Let's go!
[03:50:50.896 --> 03:50:51.437]  We're good.
[03:51:03.434 --> 03:51:06.538]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:51:06.538 --> 03:51:10.442]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:51:10.442 --> 03:51:14.165]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:51:14.165 --> 03:51:21.453]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[03:51:21.553 --> 03:51:21.993]  I think so.
[03:51:47.393 --> 03:51:51.777]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:51.777 --> 03:51:53.899]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:53.899 --> 03:51:55.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:13.539 --> 03:52:16.582]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:16.582 --> 03:52:22.607]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:22.607 --> 03:52:27.652]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.652 --> 03:52:37.801]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.901 --> 03:52:40.262]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:40.262 --> 03:52:41.843]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.843 --> 03:52:44.304]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:44.304 --> 03:52:46.446]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:46.446 --> 03:52:51.568]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:51.568 --> 03:53:00.693]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:54:19.475 --> 03:54:23.358]  Founder of Ice Earth, John Schaefer, is with us.
[03:54:23.358 --> 03:54:27.641]  Sons-of-Liberty.net.
[03:54:27.641 --> 03:54:28.462]  Okay?
[03:54:28.462 --> 03:54:31.625]  Linked up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:31.625 --> 03:54:34.587]  We just got intro'd there with We The People.
[03:54:34.587 --> 03:54:36.909]  We're gonna go out with We The People.
[03:54:37.509 --> 03:54:39.050]  And this time has run out.
[03:54:39.050 --> 03:54:42.731]  I'll be back live Sunday, but I'm going to get some closing comments from you, John.
[03:54:42.731 --> 03:54:52.715]  Again, we're honored you're here and very thankful for the great contribution you've made towards fighting the tyranny and waking folks up and setting brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[03:54:52.715 --> 03:54:54.276]  Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:54.276 --> 03:54:55.857]  in the aftermath of Copenhagen.
[03:54:56.477 --> 03:54:58.399]  We don't know how bad this agreement's going to be.
[03:54:58.399 --> 03:55:03.283]  It's got the global government and the global tax, but it's only got two of the global taxes in it.
[03:55:03.283 --> 03:55:05.084]  We'll know Sunday what happened.
[03:55:05.084 --> 03:55:06.345]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:55:06.345 --> 03:55:10.949]  be sure and join us, and we'll be back live Monday, ladies and gentlemen, as well.
[03:55:10.949 --> 03:55:13.872]  So, John, again, great to have you here.
[03:55:13.872 --> 03:55:15.713]  The guys are going to take you out and show you around Austin.
[03:55:15.713 --> 03:55:17.034]  I got family in town.
[03:55:17.034 --> 03:55:17.875]  I wish we could hang out.
[03:55:18.395 --> 03:55:26.798]  But certainly, I want to ask you to come back to Austin when you get back from tour in the next three or four months because I really like what you're doing and want to work with you more.
[03:55:26.798 --> 03:55:29.078]  But in closing, we've got four minutes left.
[03:55:29.078 --> 03:55:30.439]  You've got the floor.
[03:55:30.439 --> 03:55:36.881]  John Schaefer, founder of Iced Earth and Sons of Liberty, launching his free album today for you.
[03:55:36.881 --> 03:55:38.441]  Take advantage of it, folks.
[03:55:38.441 --> 03:55:39.882]  A new weapon in the info war.
[03:55:39.882 --> 03:55:40.422]  John Schaefer.
[03:55:41.175 --> 03:55:53.581]  I guess my biggest thing is that I'm pleading for people to be open-minded about this and to try to break free from the left-right paradigm because it's a fraud.
[03:55:53.581 --> 03:55:55.462]  I don't care about the rhetoric.
[03:55:55.462 --> 03:55:57.683]  Don't trust what these people say.
[03:55:57.683 --> 03:55:59.064]  You need to watch what they do.
[03:55:59.064 --> 03:56:02.986]  You need to watch their actions and it's becoming
[03:56:03.946 --> 03:56:08.087]  More and more clear to me that things are clearly not what they seem.
[03:56:08.087 --> 03:56:13.108]  So I'm just begging people to think outside of the box a little bit.
[03:56:13.108 --> 03:56:16.408]  You know, learn what it means to be an American.
[03:56:16.408 --> 03:56:18.049]  You know, study the Constitution.
[03:56:18.049 --> 03:56:20.009]  Go back, study the founders.
[03:56:20.009 --> 03:56:24.110]  Look, they warned us everywhere about this exact thing that's going on.
[03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:25.310]  I mean... Your dad warned us!
[03:56:25.310 --> 03:56:28.250]  You were talking about your dad when you were a kid talking about this.
[03:56:28.250 --> 03:56:31.611]  Yeah, and I mean I was really young then and at some point I think
[03:56:32.171 --> 03:56:35.113]  Maybe the burden was a little bit too much and he just didn't talk about it.
[03:56:35.113 --> 03:56:37.555]  Maybe he stopped getting involved in it.
[03:56:37.555 --> 03:56:38.816]  I'm not sure about that.
[03:56:38.816 --> 03:56:45.421]  I just remember at some point we didn't, you know, I didn't hear about that kind of stuff anymore, but I know that he had big concerns.
[03:56:45.421 --> 03:56:56.990]  I mean, I remember him, you know, we'd go into a department store, maybe it was Christmas shopping or whatever, and they would, the cashier would ask for his social security number and he would just like go off, you know, I mean, he was not a big fan of this whole
[03:56:57.250 --> 03:56:58.271]  He understood it.
[03:56:58.271 --> 03:57:12.859]  I remember Bobby Vaughn, since dying of a brain tumor, friends of my dad coming over, popping a six-pack of beer after work when I was like five, six, seven, and talking about the New World Order and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the global currency and how they were going to tax everything environmentally.
[03:57:12.859 --> 03:57:14.541]  And they had all the documents.
[03:57:14.541 --> 03:57:16.842]  And of course, my dad wasn't really a member of the JBS.
[03:57:16.842 --> 03:57:19.503]  In high school, he'd given some speeches to conservative groups.
[03:57:19.503 --> 03:57:22.205]  But I remember the JBSers coming over to the house.
[03:57:22.205 --> 03:57:26.728]  And so I think those are seeds, again, that were planted that later awakened.
[03:57:27.088 --> 03:57:27.709]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:57:27.709 --> 03:57:34.454]  I mean, and you know, you go back and watch what Robert Welch said in the 70s, you know, like, warning.
[03:57:34.454 --> 03:57:35.374]  And it's happening.
[03:57:35.374 --> 03:57:36.775]  It's what they're doing.
[03:57:36.775 --> 03:57:40.839]  And notice how they get attacked by people, by COINTELPRO, saying they're feds.
[03:57:40.839 --> 03:57:42.700]  No, judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:57:42.700 --> 03:57:44.181]  The JBS has done a great job.
[03:57:44.181 --> 03:57:44.982]  Absolutely.
[03:57:44.982 --> 03:57:49.485]  And I'm going to be joining that society here shortly.
[03:57:49.485 --> 03:57:52.607]  Because I just think that it's, this whole thing, it's
[03:57:53.549 --> 03:57:54.794]  You gotta give it to them.
[03:57:54.794 --> 03:57:55.918]  It's ingenious.
[03:57:55.918 --> 03:57:57.162]  You know, there's no doubt.
[03:57:57.162 --> 03:57:59.611]  And they've pulled off something that...
[03:58:01.727 --> 03:58:05.148]  I think we're living in the most historic times on the planet, actually, right now.
[03:58:05.148 --> 03:58:06.689]  I mean, this is big stuff.
[03:58:06.689 --> 03:58:08.870]  And people... We're actually blessed to be alive now!
[03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:09.590]  I agree.
[03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:10.891]  I mean, God test us, man.
[03:58:10.891 --> 03:58:11.651]  This is our medal.
[03:58:11.651 --> 03:58:16.673]  We're given all this decadence to make us stand down while this scientific dictatorship comes in.
[03:58:16.673 --> 03:58:20.195]  Will we have the strength to wake up and put it down and slay the dragon?
[03:58:20.195 --> 03:58:21.435]  I think we do.
[03:58:21.435 --> 03:58:27.278]  And I actually... You know, the funny thing is, I always... In interviews, when people would ask me, if you could time travel, where would you go?
[03:58:28.098 --> 03:58:34.385]  And I always said to the American Revolution, I felt like I was born in the wrong time period for most of my life.
[03:58:34.385 --> 03:58:37.268]  I mean, when I was a little kid, that's the way my room was decorated.
[03:58:37.268 --> 03:58:42.834]  I didn't have... But that was your destiny, John, in closing, because you are in the second 1776.

[03:58:52.711 --> 03:58:57.254]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:57.254 --> 03:58:58.174]  Number one.
[03:58:58.174 --> 03:59:01.596]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:01.596 --> 03:59:02.457]  Number two.
[03:59:02.457 --> 03:59:07.339]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:07.339 --> 03:59:08.100]  It's true.
[03:59:08.100 --> 03:59:12.963]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.963 --> 03:59:13.423]  Number three.
[03:59:13.763 --> 03:59:17.366]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:17.366 --> 03:59:22.070]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:24.832]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:24.832 --> 03:59:29.316]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:29.316 --> 03:59:33.460]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:33.460 --> 03:59:38.224]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
